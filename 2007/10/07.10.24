00:00:16 <Cale> Yeah, I think filtr2 is probably the sensible way to achieve that
00:00:35 <Pseudonym> I _think_ that the right answer here is for fromInteger to throw an exception if it's given a number that's out of range.
00:00:36 <Cale> filtr seems like it's faster because it doesn't do as much.
00:01:28 <Cale> Is the cached version of toUpper really faster?
00:02:02 <paczesiowa> yes
00:02:11 <omnId> toUpper is unicode, so it could be hairy.  If the list were long it could make a difference.
00:02:15 <paczesiowa> for constant memory versions
00:02:44 <Cale> omnId: I suppose it is, but does it actually work? :)
00:02:45 <Pseudonym> toUpper doesn't make sense on individual codepoints, does it?
00:03:06 <sjanssen> Cale: toUpper makes an FFI call, so I'd guess yes
00:03:24 <sjanssen> FFI calls are quite expensive
00:03:30 <Cale> ah, okay, to some unicode character handling library?
00:05:22 <sjanssen> Cale: a custom GHC library, actually
00:05:40 <Cale> that's interesting :)
00:06:04 <hpaste>  Paczesiowa annotated "string filters" with "more versions" at http://hpaste.org/3445#a1
00:06:26 <paczesiowa> there are tests (time and memory included)
00:06:29 <sjanssen> http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/base/cbits/WCsubst.c
00:07:59 <sjanssen> paczesiowa: are you using a UArray?
00:08:04 <omnId> f cs = let cs' = take 5 cs in length cs' `seq` map toUpper cs ++ cs' -- does forcing cs' allow cs to be collected?
00:08:11 <vincenz> what extension do you need for GADT?
00:08:23 <sjanssen> omnId: yeah, that should do it
00:09:04 <paczesiowa> omnId: that works, but it's ugly:P
00:09:09 <sjanssen> vincenz: GADTs, IIRC
00:09:50 <paczesiowa> sjanssen: I use import Data.Array, but only for toUpper cache
00:09:52 <hpaste>  jedahu pasted "existential list" at http://hpaste.org/3447
00:09:55 <omnId> paczesiowa: less uglier than your fused aux thing, in my rather not humble opinion :)
00:10:01 <vincenz> sjanssen: thx
00:10:55 <jedahu> any way to modify existentially qualified objects in a list?
00:11:34 <vincenz> sjanssen: hmm, it's not on the Language-Haskell-Extension.html page
00:11:38 <vincenz> sadly, that page is very uninformative
00:11:56 <Cale> jedahu: only via the interface you've given them
00:12:07 <paczesiowa> omnId: that wasn't supposed to be nice, that was supposed to be smart and memory efficient. (and ended being plain stupid:D)
00:12:50 <Cale> jedahu: Since the Answer class has no methods, you can't actually do anything with them
00:13:25 <jedahu> Cale: The Answer typeclass previously had an 'update' function, but it resulted in the same error.
00:13:54 <Cale> jedahu: effectively, when you apply the constructor Question, the types a and r are forgotten, and nothing but the methods of Answer can be used on them
00:16:22 <Cale> jedahu: Ask yourself this -- how do you know that r has the same type as the elements of the list rs?
00:16:30 <Cale> (in addResponse)
00:17:23 <Cale> The only thing that you know is that r has some instance of (Answer a r)
00:17:33 <Cale> and so does rs
00:17:40 <Cale> You don't know that they're the same instance.
00:17:49 <jedahu> Cale: Exactly. I think I know how existential quantification works, what I'm trying to work out is whether I can't encode this problem because I don't know how, or because it's not typeable.
00:19:02 <Cale> Well, unless you were to somehow make addResponse a method of Answer, you can't, but even then, you wouldn't have many values of type r to choose from.
00:19:13 <Cale> You could only use the existing ones in the list.
00:20:47 <vincenz> sjanssen: seems to be "Rank2Types"
00:21:03 <jedahu> So the only way to be able to add responses is to ditch typeclasses and use a tagged union instead?
00:21:08 <sjanssen> vincenz: are you using GHC 6.6?
00:21:12 <Cale> If they're really Strings, it seems a little funny to be using existentials to encode them :)
00:21:16 <quicksilver> jedahu: you can use existentials without using type classes
00:21:41 <jedahu> Sorry, I meant, ditch both :-)
00:21:44 <quicksilver> jedahu: you can just abstract over a tuple or similar, which contains the operations you want to use
00:21:51 <Cale> Yeah, you can, it's just more unwieldy and doesn't fix the problem. :)
00:22:07 * quicksilver admits he hasn't actually looked at jedahu's post :P
00:22:10 <jedahu> the responses are not always strings
00:22:20 <quicksilver> but existentials seem to be a popular topic these days :)
00:22:25 <jedahu> Cale: yep, it's not extensible for one.
00:22:52 <Cale> Well, the typeclass isn't really extensible either.
00:23:01 <Cale> (Unless you just modify it)
00:23:26 <Cale> So you need to work out a good set of primitive operations
00:23:33 <jedahu> But with typeclasses I can add an Answer-Response type in a different file.
00:23:37 <Cale> What things do you need to be able to do with responses?
00:23:57 <Cale> Do you always have some way to turn a String into a Response?
00:24:07 <jedahu> Each question holds a list of responses which gets added to when anyone answers a question.
00:24:12 <Cale> (and/or vice-versa?)
00:24:27 <jedahu> That's the idea.
00:24:28 <Cale> Why are you allowing for non-string responses?
00:24:58 <jedahu> For scale or option questions. Or boolean ones (YesNo).
00:25:10 <jedahu> Makes statistical analysis easier.
00:25:44 <Cale> Okay, I'd probably just go with a tagged union, myself.
00:25:48 <Cale> But if you want to do this
00:26:03 <jedahu> client facing code will translate their typed (or webformed) response and turn it into the appropriate response type
00:26:23 <Cale> Add Read r and Show r to the existential type there
00:26:42 <Cale> That gives you a way to construct values of type r and to turn them back into Strings.
00:26:46 <jedahu> Yes. They are actually there, just stripped out for the hpaste.
00:27:12 <Cale> So the type of addResponse should be Survey -> Question -> String -> Survey
00:27:49 <Cale> (or Maybe Survey at the end, if you want to handle parse errors more cleanly)
00:27:52 <jedahu> Ah. That's useful. I was envisaging the String -> Response conversion occurring at a higher level.
00:29:17 <Cale> Well, there's no way that you can know otherwise *at compile time* that the value supplied is the right type to go into the Question.
00:30:01 <jedahu> how right you are :-)
00:30:14 <jedahu> thanks
00:30:27 <Cale> No problem
00:31:16 <Cale> Consider using reads and returning a Maybe Survey if it returned an empty list.
00:31:33 <Cale> er, to handle the case of when it returns an empty list
00:32:16 <Cale> Because presumably users will be typing in values, and you really don't want exceptions to occur when they don't parse.
00:33:32 <Cale> (Exceptions of the sort produced by calls to error are extremely hard to catch, and can only be caught in IO)
00:34:19 <jedahu> Yes, all wrapped up in the state monad and stored by happs.
00:34:28 <jedahu> That's the idea anyway...
00:34:35 <omnId> readMaybe s = case reads s of [(x,"")] -> Just x; _ -> Nothing
00:34:46 <Cale> right, that's the function you want :)
00:35:07 <jedahu> cheers
00:42:54 <Cale> jedahu: another potential snag...
00:43:21 <Cale> jedahu: Presumably this library is going to collect a bunch of responses from users, which have different types
00:43:35 <jedahu> that is the intention
00:43:41 <Cale> jedahu: But then those responses are only going to be accessible through the interface of Answer
00:43:49 <jedahu> yes
00:43:52 <Cale> Their real types forgotten
00:44:49 <jedahu> what's the snag?
00:45:20 <Cale> So unless Answer includes lots of stuff for tabulating results, the library user will be unable to do that.
00:45:23 <Cale> er, sorry, ethernet dropped for a sec
00:45:25 <Cale> So unless Answer includes lots of stuff for tabulating results, the library user will be unable to do that.
00:45:54 <jedahu> so Answer could be quite busy...
00:45:58 <Cale> yeah
00:46:29 <Cale> and could result in some nonsense operations.
00:46:42 <Cale> (Like, isTrue)
00:47:32 <Cale> The library user could use show to show the value, but then what's the difference between that and a String?
00:49:04 <jedahu> each Answer would have to generate its own summary stats
00:49:13 <Cale> yeah
00:50:10 <jedahu> so I have a delicious tradeoff between this and a tagged union
00:50:36 <Cale> hmm
00:51:11 <Cale> Oh, each Question manages its entire list of responses already, so perhaps that's not so bad
00:51:40 <Cale> You just need to provide a way, in the Answer interface, to define a summary mechanism per instance of Answer.
00:52:24 <Cale> summary :: (Answer a r) => [r] -> ...
00:52:45 <jedahu> Answer shouldn't have to do too much lifting if I can figure out the salient bits to put in its interface.
00:53:08 <jedahu> Yeah, something like that.
00:53:24 <Cale> Either String, or a new type parameter to the Answer class
00:55:56 <jedahu> the type parameter being the summary type?
00:56:02 <Cale> yeah
01:03:57 <qubit> hi room
01:05:12 <dmwit> Hi, qubit!
01:06:40 <qubit> i am working on user defined stata types for months and seasons, I declared both data types, but looking at it, there must be an easier way to write function with these types as 3 months to a season so far :data Month =

01:06:40 <qubit> 			deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

01:08:09 <omnId> toSeason m | m `elem` [Mar..May] = Spring

01:13:39 <dpall> can u help me?
01:13:55 <dmwit> Hi, dpall!
01:13:59 <dmwit> Go ahead and ask your question.
01:14:20 <dpall> i have to understand how to solve a differential equation: the equation of Duffin...
01:14:40 <dpall> i don't know where to start...someone could help me?
01:14:43 <dmwit> That sounds like maybe it's a question for #math... is it Haskell related?
01:14:50 <dpall> dunno.
01:14:57 <dpall> Maybe i'll now try on #math
01:15:11 <dpall> i didn't know the existence of that channelù
01:16:45 <LeCamarade> I could make my IO a code shorter and clearer by using Functor.
01:17:09 <dpall> sorry?

01:19:36 <dmwit> HOLY WAR
01:19:38 <luqui> http://hpaste.org/3449   -- how do I hint the strictness analyzer to make m strict?
01:19:43 <LeCamarade> Swords, comrades!
01:20:29 <hpaste>  sjanssen annotated "How to hint strictness analyzer (i.e. w/o using seq or bang pattern?)" with "this bang pattern should do the trick" at http://hpaste.org/3449#a1
01:20:42 <sjanssen> oops, I didn't read the title :)
01:20:51 <luqui> :-)
01:21:24 <sjanssen> luqui: seq (and bang patterns which turn into seq) is the only way
01:21:30 <luqui> okay, fair enough
01:21:44 <luqui> I have gone for a year in haskell without ever using seq
01:21:54 <luqui> but i had a program which stack overflowed in a situation which reduced to this
01:22:00 <luqui> I guess I have to break down and use it :-)
01:22:19 <sjanssen> you could do pattern matching or a comparison on 'm', but that's mostly useless
01:23:00 <luqui> yeah, that would be a hack
01:23:40 <luqui> Also I notice that if I pull overflow out of IO, then it figures it out
01:27:09 <mm_freak> most packages refuse to compile with GHC 6.8â€¦  am i doing something wrong, or is it better to stick with 6.6.1 for now?
01:29:33 <sjanssen> mm_freak: the libraries were reorganized quite a bit for 6.8
01:30:05 <sjanssen> you should stick with 6.6.1 if you don't want to patch the .cabal files yourself
01:31:23 <mm_freak> what's the advantage of 6.8 anyway?  better code or more extensions?
01:31:46 <quicksilver> bigger number!
01:31:52 <quicksilver> the advantage is 0.2!
01:32:11 <quicksilver> the compiler has improved in a couple of interesting ways: specconstr optimisation, for one
01:32:21 <quicksilver> type families and stuff have been added
01:32:25 <dmwit> Plus, you get forM, a new combinator!
01:32:33 <quicksilver> forM is in 6.6.1...
01:32:34 <dmwit> Which is, of course, totally different from mapM.
01:32:45 <dmwit> oh, 6.6
01:32:47 <dmwit> whoops
01:33:01 * dmwit is always a version behind
01:33:02 <quicksilver> 6.8 comes with shiny new bytestring with improved fusion, I think
01:33:11 <dmwit> And a debugger?
01:33:23 <dcoutts> quicksilver: no, the improved fusion did not make it
01:33:40 <sjanssen> dcoutts: aww, how come?
01:33:43 <dcoutts> quicksilver: but we can release a updated bytestring without changing the api
01:33:47 <mm_freak> ok, i'll revert back to 6.6.1
01:34:06 <mm_freak> i just can't bring the MTL to compile properly with 6.8
01:34:06 <quicksilver> dmwit: ah yes, ghci debugger
01:34:18 <dcoutts> sjanssen: not enough time. I managed to update the api in time, so that it'll be possible to update to the improved fusion system in the next release without breaking anything.
01:34:22 <quicksilver> dcoutts: ah. shame. but good.
01:39:53 <encryptio_> how would i implement layered i/o operations? i have many layers of abstraction in my development plan, and except for two of the layers, they all do some i/o. how do i handle going up and down in this stack of abstractions without losing my sanity?
01:40:14 <encryptio_> (code written so far = "")
01:40:28 <quicksilver> I would abandon all hope of keeping your sanity, from the outset
01:40:37 <quicksilver> and just settle on a comfortable level of delusion
01:41:09 <quicksilver> More seriously, I'd arrange the layers into custom typeclasses
01:41:21 <quicksilver> where each typeclass contains all the primitives rquired for that layer
01:41:33 <quicksilver> write your functions as polymorphically as possible
01:41:36 <encryptio_> and most have persistent things they need to keep track of (tcp connections, for example)
01:41:42 <quicksilver> and then provide an instance or two for a concrete monad
01:42:12 <quicksilver> eg: classes MyTCP, MyNetwork, MyLogging
01:42:25 <quicksilver> then instance MyTCP (StateT (TCPState) IO)
01:42:38 <quicksilver> Cale will have clearer advice if he's still awake
01:42:46 <Cale> hi
01:43:15 <quicksilver> the general rule of thumb for big stacks of monad transformers is don't use them "explicitly"
01:43:28 <quicksilver> instead, write typeclasses which encapsulate the primitves you actually need
01:43:31 <Cale> Yeah, you definitely want to newtype them.
01:43:42 <quicksilver> and just implement those typeclasses over an ugly transformer stack
01:43:46 <quicksilver> you only have to write the instance once :)
01:44:10 <encryptio> i get the idea, but i don't see how it fits into haskell code
01:46:31 <Cale> encryptio: hmm
01:46:54 <Cale> Well, actually, I'd avoid overengineering abstractions right away...
01:47:18 <Cale> Start small and see what abstractions fit in later, perhaps.
01:47:21 <encryptio> it's pretty rough - "filesystem layer" - "dynamic block allocation layer" - "overnet" - "file stores" (that's top down)
01:47:45 <Cale> If you can't see quite how the code will look from the outset, then you definitely need to experiment a bit.
01:48:34 <encryptio> i can see how it fits together, but not in haskell. honestly i was going to implement this in perl, but wondered if haskell would be beneficial (perl+POE is a pain with this many asynchronous pieces)
01:49:49 <Cale> The only difference in Haskell which I'd worry about initially, is figuring out how to structure things so that as little of the program as possible is doing actual I/O.
01:49:53 <quicksilver> haskell is very nice for naive asynchronous code
01:50:01 <quicksilver> just use threads and a couple  of MVars
01:50:07 <Cale> But yeah, if you need concurrency, it's very easy.
01:50:14 <quicksilver> of course you can't be completely naive, you do have to think a bit about how you use the MVars
01:50:20 <quicksilver> btu compared to most languages it's a breeze :)
01:50:27 <Cale> You can take any I/O action you want and apply forkIO to it
01:50:34 <Cale> and it'll run in a separate thread
01:50:39 <encryptio> i've used channels before for a chat server test. it was sw33t. thus, why i considered it over POE
01:50:44 <Cale> (Just make sure your main thread doesn't die)
01:51:00 * osfameron shudders at the thought of POE
01:51:58 <mux> @pl \y -> f y >>= \z -> Just (z,z)
01:51:58 <lambdabot> (Just . join (,) =<<) . f
01:53:21 <encryptio> got any links to relatively simple (heh..) code that uses that form of abstraction management?
01:53:28 <dmwit> ?pl \y -> f y >>= return . (\z -> (z, z))
01:53:28 <lambdabot> (join (,) `fmap`) . f
01:53:57 <mux> @pl f ?y >>= Just . join (,)
01:53:57 <lambdabot> Just . join (,) =<< f ? y
01:54:01 <dmwit> encryptio: Maybe xmonad?
01:54:51 <Stinger_> so, how do you people structure your code when writing gui apps?
01:55:07 <Cale> encryptio: basically, think about the actual computation which your program is performing. If it's really just a whole whack of I/O, that's fine, but quite often you can do more outside of IO than you'd expect.
01:55:26 <Stinger_> I wrote a little simple gui timer thing and found that I seemed to be coding in essentially an imperetive style
01:55:39 <Stinger_> imperative(?)
01:55:40 <encryptio> Cale: the only pieces i see that aren't IO-bound are picking slaves for blocks, compression, and encryption
01:55:41 <Cale> Stinger_: Well, you can do that.
01:55:51 <encryptio> all of which is simply handled in one layer
01:56:11 <encryptio> or, will be
01:56:25 <Cale> Stinger_: There are attempts at higher level gui libraries, but the existing polished ones are sort of imperative.
01:56:38 <Stinger_> yeah well I was using gtk2hs
01:56:50 <Stinger_> and I probably will for my next app too
01:56:59 <encryptio> Cale: i mean, implementing a filesystem... you can't exactly shy away from IO there. =p
01:57:35 <Cale> encryptio: yeah, I suppose so :)
01:57:40 <mux> @src Maybe mzero
01:57:40 <lambdabot> mzero = Nothing
01:57:49 <Cale> encryptio: though I haven't done it myself, so I'm not sure :)
01:58:20 <Stinger_> how do people here structure their data in interactive apps?
01:59:45 <encryptio> Stinger_: i write a good model with useful enough operations on it, then let the rest fall into place where it will
01:59:55 <Cale> I agree with encryptio :)
02:00:34 <Stinger_> hmmm
02:01:20 <Stinger_> just in my first try, I found the way I was passing around data to be a bit messy
02:01:31 <Stinger_> or at least passing around all the IORefs and such
02:01:47 <mux> @pl \x -> if x == 1 then Nothing else Just x
02:01:47 <lambdabot> ap (flip if' Nothing . (1 ==)) Just
02:02:29 <Cale> In Haskell, there's something a little more to data than usual though.
02:02:29 <Cale> As well as the obvious sort of data, recursive types are kind of like frozen recursions.
02:02:30 <quicksilver> Stinger_: try to categorise your functions in terms of whether they actually change stuff or not, and whether they actually do IO
02:02:34 * Cale pings...
02:02:35 <Stinger_> I don't suppose you have an example of a good model :)
02:02:38 <Cale> My local ethernet connection keeps dropping mysteriously.
02:02:44 <Cale> Stinger_: oh
02:02:47 <Cale> Stinger_: which library?
02:02:50 <quicksilver> Stinger_: if your function only needs access to the state, but doesn't change it, make it MyState -> IO ()
02:03:04 <Cale> Stinger_: I find it helpful to write event handlers in a big let block
02:03:04 <quicksilver> Stinger_: if your function changes the state, but doesn't do IO, make it MyState -> MyState
02:03:22 <quicksilver> Stinger_: this minimises passing around of IORefs
02:03:42 <mux> @pl \x -> x : foo x
02:03:42 <lambdabot> ap (:) foo
02:04:09 <Stinger_> so when you guys write code you tend to have one state block? or state monad which you pass around (or run in)
02:04:16 <Stinger_> not multiple
02:04:28 <quicksilver> I try to keep the types of particular functions minimal
02:04:55 <quicksilver> so if you don't modify the state, declare that in your type. If you dont' do IO, declare that in your type.
02:09:51 <Cale> I actually don't use the State monad a whole lot.
02:10:22 <Cale> I prefer passing things explicitly quite a lot of the time
02:10:39 <Cale> because you get a really good sense of what depends on what that way
02:10:48 <bakert> How do I pass -fno-monomorphism-restriction to runhaskell?
02:10:56 <Cale> and it forces you to package your data sensibly
02:11:09 <bakert> runhaskell -fno-monomorphism-restriction Main.hs just dies with no output
02:11:15 <Cale> bakert: hmm
02:11:50 <bakert> {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-monomorphism-restriction #-} seems to be ignored
02:11:55 <bakert> as does {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
02:12:11 <LeCamarade> Who ever found a nice place to use MonadPlus?
02:12:31 <bakert> same problem using cabal
02:12:46 <bakert> perhaps i should use GHC-options in the cabal file?
02:13:24 <bakert> hmm.  nope.
02:13:39 <bakert> perhaps i go the syntax wrong:
02:13:40 <bakert> GHC-options:    -fno-monomorphism-restriction
02:13:47 <bakert> (as the last line of the cabal file)
02:13:48 <mux> and Extensions: NoMonomorphismRestriction doesn't work either?
02:14:02 <bakert> at the bottom of the file?
02:14:19 <mux> no, in the first block
02:14:20 <bakert> no joy
02:14:22 <bakert> ah
02:14:25 <bakert> ok let me try that :)
02:14:44 <bakert> Setup.hs: Error: Non-empty library, but empty exposed modules list. Cabal may not build this library correctly
02:14:46 <bakert> ?
02:15:22 <mux> you have an empty line causing problems somewhere it seems?
02:16:29 <bakert> empty line above "Executable:" but I think that's meant to be there?
02:17:02 <mux> according to the message you pasted I guess there are things that are in the wrong place though
02:17:20 <bakert> if i remove
02:17:29 <bakert> Extensions: NoMonomorphismRestriction
02:17:35 <bakert> from the bottom of the top block it works ok
02:17:47 <bakert> (except i get my error about the monomorphism restriction :) )
02:17:59 <bakert> but it compiles the first module
02:18:15 <bakert> are there more rules about where Extensions has to go in the file?
02:18:31 <bakert> i put it under Build-Depends
02:19:01 <bakert> @paste
02:19:02 <lambdabot> Haskell pastebin: http://hpaste.org/new
02:19:40 <hpaste>  bakert pasted "Stoopid mistake in cabal file" at http://hpaste.org/3452
02:26:25 <bakert> any idea what's up with that ^^^
02:26:39 <bakert> or where i should add the "Extensions: NoMonomorphismRestriction" line?
02:26:45 <bakert> (it seems to work until I add that)
02:28:51 <quicksilver> Cale: yes, the reader monad is much the same
02:29:06 <quicksilver> Cale: I'm using the reader monad, or in fact ReaderT Foo IO, quite often
02:29:17 <quicksilver> Cale: but it's not actually worth the noise of 'runReaderT' to use it properly
02:29:26 <quicksilver> Cale: I just \foo -> do a foo ; b foo

04:43:54 <roconnor> sjanssen: I was contemplating overloading >>
04:44:09 <roconnor> sjanssen: explict imports are generally a good idea
04:44:27 <roconnor> to prevent someone from unexpectedly extending their module on you.
04:44:27 <sjanssen> for core functions like >>=?  I remain unconvinced
04:44:44 <roconnor> but I never do it.
04:44:46 <roconnor> too much work
04:44:51 <Axioplase> joelr1: shouldn't be that different from language processing in any functional language. Gerard Huet (the creator of the "zipper") does some linguistics research too
04:45:07 <joelr1> Axioplase: i see
04:45:50 <roconnor> I like how Huet is credited for creating the zipper when his article starts off by saying he is sure that it has been invented before.
04:46:02 <roconnor> Perhaps it is better to say Huet named the zipper

04:53:49 * ski wonders why many papers doesn't include write or publish dates
04:55:33 <Axioplase> ski: so that people who read your article think that you are young
04:56:01 <ChilliX> ski: because these dates are in thje proceedings (ie, books) from which the papers are taken
04:57:23 <ski> ChilliX : i figure that. but since i mostly read papers individually, either online or printed by someone, i'd like dates individually, as well
04:57:52 <ChilliX> ski: I was offering an explanation, not a justification :)
04:57:57 <ski> (and i assume other people do that a lot, as well)
04:58:16 <ski> (Axioplase : i, btw, do not follow)
04:58:39 <ChilliX> It's just that you format the paper, send it to the publisher and stick in on your homepage
04:59:10 <ChilliX> People could make the extra effort to add info about the publication in the version on their homepage
04:59:17 <Axioplase> ski: that was just a joke. Many researchers have an old picture of them on their websites. Since there is no date on the artcile, one can really not tell how old they are.
04:59:25 <ChilliX> but then usually the text around the link on the homepage has that info
05:00:20 <ski> (Axioplase : oh. .. actually i misread "young" as "wrong")
05:00:31 <pejo> The date is very useful to have in there, I must say. I think someone (SPJ?) recommends putting it there in some advice about writing.
05:00:56 <ski> ChilliX : just approximate write date, or last edit date would be useful
05:01:37 <swiert> Wow. Haskell web development job advertised in Nottingham on @cafe. Who'd of thought that?
05:02:45 <ChilliX> pejo: oh, I agree it would be good to put it in there, but that usually means some awkward LaTeX hacks if you don't want to mess up the formatting of the rest of the paper again
05:03:05 <ketil> Hmm... I'm trying to specify -smp as a GHC-option in Cabal, but this is incompatible with profiling (configure -p).
05:03:07 <ketil> Any solution?
05:03:35 <sjanssen> ketil: the profiling and threaded runtimes aren't compatible
05:03:59 <ketil> sjanssen, how do I express it in the cabal file?  I need smp for the non-profiling runtime (at least)
05:04:15 <pejo> ChilliX, hm, true.
05:04:29 <ChilliX> ski: What I do when I want to know that I google for the title, which usually brings you to the "publications" page of an author,which includes the usual citation info
05:05:11 <ChilliX> pejo: plus LaTeX hacks avry depending on what publisher was used (well, mostly that means to versions, one for llncs and one for sigplanconf)
05:05:14 <sjanssen> ketil: no, I don't know a good workaround
05:05:17 <ChilliX> avry = vary
05:05:27 <ketil> sjanssen, I'll make do without profiling for now, then. :-(
05:05:27 <ChilliX> to versions = two version
05:05:29 <sjanssen> ketil: you're building an executable, yeah?
05:05:35 <ketil> no, a library.
05:05:46 <sjanssen> ketil: -smp doesn't do anything for libraries
05:06:01 <ketil> oh, crap.  It's a linking thing, isn't it.
05:06:01 <sjanssen> it's a link time option only
05:06:18 <pejo> ChilliX, you can't be sure it's the same version that you read when browsing their homepage though.
05:06:33 <ketil> well, I wash my hands of any problems :-)
05:06:34 <Sonderblade> can you use hugs with gtk2hs?
05:07:28 <ski> ChilliX : ok
05:07:56 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: not at the moment
05:07:58 <ChilliX> pejo: but in that case, the version on the homepage is probably the newer one and the one you should read
05:08:33 <Sonderblade> dcoutts: why? is there a big difference between compiled and interpreted haskell?
05:09:32 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: no, it's more to do with complexities of packaging. I hope that when Gtk2Hs uses Cabal to build that we'll be able to make it work with hugs and nhc/yhc.

05:10:19 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: yes.
05:10:54 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: the state of things for pretty much all serious haskell programming is that people just use ghc
05:11:11 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: we try and keep things portable, but generally only use ghc
05:11:24 <Sonderblade> dcoutts: i don't like ghc it is very very slow
05:11:36 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: have you used ghci ?
05:11:52 <Sonderblade> dcoutts: no
05:12:04 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: it's just like hugs
05:12:22 <Sonderblade> dcoutts: what's the point of hugs then? :)
05:12:27 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: it's still a bit slower to load code that hugs
05:12:42 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: well exactly
05:12:57 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: hugs is faster to load code and is more portable to other system, it's much smaller and lighter.
05:13:15 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: you can run hugs on your pda
05:13:46 <Sonderblade> dcoutts: yes but ... why would i want to run hugs on my pda?
05:14:09 <dcoutts> Sonderblade: because it's really cool! :-)

05:19:18 <opqdonut> there's the source for mine
05:19:21 <ivanm> kinda what I wanted, but I'd prefer the precision argument to be given to the actual generating function
05:19:34 <opqdonut> http://opqdonut.users.paivola.fi/mandel.png <-- amd a screenshot
05:20:30 <roconnor> ivanm: no problem.  It is the topic of my research
05:20:44 <ivanm> *nod*
05:20:46 <roconnor> ivanm: I don't understand your last comment.
05:21:14 <ivanm> roconnor: boehm's paper in "topics in functional programming" discusses representing reals by generating functions that take in a precision argument
05:21:40 <ivanm> e.g. pi would be represented by : pi :: Int -> ExactReal, with the Int argument being some kind of precision parameter
05:21:54 <roconnor> ivanm: how is Lester's work not generating function that take in a precision argument?
05:22:14 <roconnor> ivanm: what would ExactReal be?
05:22:18 <wli> This use of "generating function" conflicts with another.
05:22:46 <ivanm> roconnor: lester leaves the precision argument to the displaying of the number
05:22:58 <ivanm> and ExactReal would be the type of your implementation :p
05:23:03 <ivanm> e.g. CReal in lester's work
05:23:11 <ivanm> wli: ?
05:23:43 <roconnor> ivanm: CReal is a function taking an Int
05:23:46 <wli> It usually refers to a function series whose coefficients represent a sequence.
05:23:50 <roconnor> you don't have to call show
05:23:53 * ivanm checks again
05:24:15 <wli> e.g. power series where the coefficients of the n-th powers are the n-th elements of the sequences.
05:24:56 <wli> Such as \sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n z^n = (1 - z - z^2)^{-1} for the Fibonacci numbers.
05:25:13 <ivanm> roconnor: true... but it's hardcoded in
05:25:17 <ketil> I seem to have problems loading my library into GHCi - I get error messages referring to an unexported module.  It works when compiling with GHC.  Is this expected?
05:25:23 <ketil> Loading package bio-0.3.1 ... linking ... <interactive>: /usr/local/lib/bio-0.3.1/ghc-6.8.0.20071017/HSbio-0.3.1.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_biozm0zi3zi1_BioziUtil_'
05:25:26 <roconnor> ivanm: I don't understand.
05:25:30 <ivanm> what I want is that the "numbers" are actually functions that take in a precision parameter
05:25:54 <roconnor> ivanm: CReal is a number that is actually a function that takes in a precision parameter.
05:25:55 <ivanm> roconnor: I want to be able to go "pi 3", and it will return pi to 3 significant place/decimal points/whatever
05:26:19 <roconnor> ivanm: let apprixomate (CR_ f) = approximate pi 3
05:26:23 <roconnor> rt
05:26:24 <ivanm> roconnor: but when defining equality, etc. its hardocded in to use the "digits" variable
05:26:25 <roconnor> wait
05:26:33 <roconnor> ivanm: let apprixomate (CR_ f) = f in approximate pi 3
05:26:38 <paolino> :t runIO
05:26:43 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `runIO'
05:27:09 <roconnor> ivanm: only a few functions use the hard-coded digits variable
05:27:28 <roconnor> ivanm: only the functions that are not sensable anyways
05:27:43 <roconnor> ivanm: if you want you can remove them (you shouldn't call them anyways) or you could use my work ;)
05:28:01 <ivanm> roconnor: do you have a repo?
05:28:08 <roconnor> I think I do
05:28:11 <ivanm> and using that let statement produces garbage...
05:28:52 <roconnor> ivanm: let apprixomate (CR_ f) n = (f n)/(2^n) in approximate pi 3
05:29:14 <roconnor> ivanm: let apprixomate (CR_ f) n = (fromInteger (f n))/(2^n) in approximate pi 3
05:29:32 <roconnor> ivanm: let apprixomate (CR_ f) n = (fromInteger (f n))*(2^^(-n)) in approximate pi 3
05:29:35 <ivanm> heh
05:29:36 <roconnor> something like that
05:30:04 <roconnor> anyhow, I think darcs get http://r6.ca/FewDigits might get my repo
05:30:06 <lambdabot> Title: Few Digits 0.5.0
05:36:26 * roconnor likes the idea of using QuickCheck to synthesise data with specific properties.
05:37:30 <ivanm> roconnor: OK, that approximate stuff seems to have worked
05:37:35 * ivanm digs at the code a bit more
05:37:58 <roconnor> ivanm: it should be added to lambdabot
05:38:12 <ivanm> what? CReal?
05:38:16 <roconnor> yes
05:38:22 <roconnor> lambdabot has Fixed
05:38:38 <roconnor> ... which sorta seem like it is part of the standard GHC package for some reason
05:38:50 <roconnor> maybe CReal should be part of the GHC distribution too
05:42:09 <ivanm> still trying to work out how it works... since I fail to see where the Int -> Integer come in for his definition of pi...
05:42:35 <ivanm> @doc Prelude
05:42:35 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html
05:45:12 <roconnor> For him real number are represented as a function from precision to a dyadic rational number
05:45:41 <roconnor> the denominator of the dyadic rational number is implict, so only the numerator is produced
05:46:12 <roconnor> My definition of approximate is the interpretation of his structure.
05:46:30 <roconnor> I'm a bit surprised my definition doesn't appear somewhere in his file.
05:46:39 <wli> (-1)^k \sum_{n=0}^\infty \delta_n z^n where \delta_n is 0 or 1 and z = 1/2 is the point of interest?
05:46:49 <ivanm> roconnor: why would your definition appear in your file?
05:46:54 <ivanm> s/your/his
05:47:17 <ivanm> @google dyadic rational number site:wikipedia.org
05:47:19 <lambdabot> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_fraction
05:47:19 <lambdabot> Title: Dyadic rational - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
05:48:41 <ivanm> roconnor: OK, I get that... but where does the precision come in for his definition of pi?
05:51:52 <roconnor> ivanm: you supply the precision
05:52:31 <ivanm> but how? or is the atan function generated from the other precision-based ones supplied there as well?
05:54:02 <roconnor> the error is propogated
05:54:18 <roconnor> until you get to the primitive elementary functions
05:56:56 <ivanm> roconnor: *nod*

06:12:23 <joelr1> dons: have you guys implemented scalable web servers?
06:14:17 <sorear> we've got plenty of unscalable ones
06:14:18 <wli> I just want a CGI script not requiring any system configuration changes that will work for blogging.
06:14:39 <wli> Oh, with some kind of LaTeX plugin.
06:15:01 <joelr1> sorear: ;-)
06:15:10 <shapr> hiya joelr1
06:15:15 <joelr1> shapr: yo!
06:15:28 <joelr1> shapr: how's business?
06:15:34 <wli> Trouble is I haven't got enough time to even investigate the options much less write anything.
06:15:54 <shapr> joelr1: business is good, what about you?
06:16:04 <shapr> wli: I want something like that too.
06:16:11 <shapr> Though I want it in HAppS
06:16:18 <joelr1> shapr: when is happs taking over the world?
06:16:25 <shapr> Probably when we get some documentation.
06:16:39 <joelr1> shapr: no work yet, studying natural language processing
06:16:40 <wli> HAppS is fine by me so long as it's doing something that fits that description.
06:16:41 <shapr> The code is good enough, too bad so few understand it.
06:17:12 <vegai> Do you have a need for more people?
06:17:38 <shapr> You should ask alexj about that :-)
06:18:37 <roconnor> ivanm: CRealI
06:18:54 <arved> hi, i have a question, in hugs is there something similar to time(1), for simple performance measurements?
06:18:58 <roconnor> ivanm: or are you talking about my repo?
06:19:00 <wli> Anything for complex numbers yet?
06:19:09 <ivanm> roconnor: yours :p
06:19:30 <ivanm> wli: well, lester's seems to support complex numbers
06:19:35 <ivanm> using Data.Complex
06:19:43 <ivanm> :t (:+)
06:19:44 <lambdabot> forall a. (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> Complex a
06:20:19 <sorear> arved: :set +r ?
06:20:48 <roconnor> ivanm: Data.Real.CReal has most of the math definitions
06:21:03 <ivanm> *nod*
06:21:28 <wli> Not sure why you couldn't just have things as a function of a tolerance or other error bound.
06:21:40 <ivanm> wli: that's what I'm after
06:21:50 <Sizur> > let a = a in a
06:21:52 <lambdabot>  Exception: <<loop>>
06:21:58 <ivanm> roconnor: though it doesn't look I can just load CReal.hs into ghci and play with it :(
06:22:22 <sorear> arved: but if you are optimizing for constant factors, you should probably be playing with an optimizing compiler like ghc or hbc
06:22:35 <sorear> arved: hugs is fine for asymptotics though
06:22:47 <vvv> Hello! What is the function to expand "~/some_path" to "/home/vvv/some_path"?
06:23:22 <roconnor> ivanm: Illega instance declaration?
06:23:30 <roconnor> stupid GHC version changes
06:23:38 <arved> sorear: well i just want to compare two implementations...
06:23:44 <wli> In general it involves fishing through getpwent which is basically a front end to fiddle with /etc/passwd
06:23:45 <ivanm> roconnor: no, it can't find your other libs like Data.Multimonial :s
06:23:51 <therp> vvv: haven't seen anything like this, just use prefixOf "~" in conjunction with (getEnv "HOME")
06:23:52 <ivanm> maybe it's just how I'm loading it...
06:23:58 <wli> Data.Multinomial?
06:24:09 <quicksilver> vvv: this is a traditional functionality of unix shells, but nothing more
06:24:17 <ivanm> wli: roconnor's module
06:24:19 <roconnor> ivanm: ghci Data/Real/CReal.hs
06:24:21 <quicksilver> vvv: it is not part of the unix-style file libraries
06:24:23 <vvv> therp: thank you
06:24:25 <therp> wli: imho "~" is mapped to $HOME, my zsh does
06:24:26 <profmakx> vvv, that is a shell expansion
06:24:33 <wli> ivanm: Spelling question.
06:24:45 <ivanm> roconnor: heh, I've been loading it up through emac's haskell mode
06:24:45 <vvv> quicksilver: yep, I guess you are right.
06:24:48 <wli> therp: Explaining how to expand it.
06:24:50 <ivanm> wli: heh, fair enough
06:24:52 <roconnor> wli: apparently Multinomial is a word I made up :(
06:24:54 <vvv> thank you!
06:25:11 <wli> roconnor: Multinomial vs. Multimonial
06:25:29 <therp> vvv: btw, ~someuser/file might be more work, as wli said. this might not work with $HOME.
06:25:31 <roconnor> wli: oh is that the error I've made?
06:25:41 <wli> roconnor: i.e. "was Multimonial a typo?"
06:25:50 * joelr1 is timing the ghc build on his mbp
06:26:25 <roconnor> wli: Ah indeed it was a typo
06:26:30 <roconnor> Data.Multinomial is the name
06:26:31 <ivanm> roconnor: Illegal instance declaration for `MultinomialUniformCts...
06:26:40 <roconnor> ivanm: yeah, I think I have a patch for that
06:26:42 <roconnor> one sec
06:26:48 <ivanm> though it's weird that I can't load it via haskell-mode :s
06:28:18 <roconnor> ivanm: okay, try darcs pull
06:28:42 <ivanm> roconnor: :D
06:29:06 <roconnor> I had the fix sitting in darcs whatsnew for a while now I guess.
06:29:20 <ivanm> heh
06:29:26 <shapr> mmm code
06:29:31 <roconnor> hunk ./Data/Real/CReal.hs 1

06:29:31 <roconnor> +{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fglasgow-exts -fallow-undecidable-instances #-}
06:29:34 <ivanm> for some reason, haskell-mode can't load the Combinatorics module :s
06:29:41 <ivanm> probably can't work out where it is
06:29:51 <roconnor> ivanm: I know nothing about emacs mode
06:30:10 <ivanm> roconnor: not saying you do.. I'm just doing general whining :p
06:30:20 <roconnor> ivanm: :)
06:30:53 <roconnor> ivanm: I think you will find my code generally slower than David's code ... at least that is what i wrote in my paper :P
06:31:05 <ivanm> k
06:31:11 <ivanm> I don't really care about efficiency
06:31:48 <ivanm> for this project I've got, I have to look at exact real arithmetic implementations, see what they have in common and try and convert at least one into being based around fold operations
06:33:43 <ivanm> roconnor: so which paper is this code for?
06:33:54 <ivanm> or haven't you written it yet?
06:35:54 <roconnor> ivanm: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960129506005871

06:36:20 <tech> ?seen airy
06:36:20 <lambdabot> Last time I saw airy was when I left ##logic, #darcs, #gentoo-haskell, #ghc, #haskell, #haskell-blah, #haskell-overflow, #haskell-soc, #jtiger, #parrot, #perl6, #scala, #scannedinavian, #unicycling
06:36:21 <lambdabot> and #xmonad 4d 21h 22m 31s ago, and .
06:36:33 <ivanm> roconnor: *nod*
06:36:37 <ivanm> roconnor: thanks for all your help
06:36:37 <roconnor> ivanm: If you don't care about efficency, then I'm your man :)
06:36:41 <ivanm> heh
06:36:55 <ivanm> according to my lecturer, the less efficient the better :p
06:37:02 <roconnor> oh
06:37:03 <tech> did anyone see airy
06:37:07 <ivanm> efficiency is left as an exercise to the interested reader :p
06:37:10 <roconnor> well, you can get even more ineffecient I think
06:37:24 <ivanm> lol
06:37:29 * ivanm -> bed
06:37:32 <ivanm> g'night all!
06:37:59 <LeCamarade> It is bed <- return ivanm , I think.
06:38:01 <roconnor> ivanm: http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Libraries_and_tools/Mathematics#Real_and_rational_numbers
06:38:03 <lambdabot> Title: Applications and libraries/Mathematics - HaskellWiki, http://tinyurl.com/yshqfj
06:39:21 <shachaf> LeCamarade: What about the monad laws? It should just be let bed = ivanm, which doesn't make sense.
06:39:46 <ivanm> *sigh*
06:40:05 <roconnor> return ivanm :: Bed Person
06:40:18 <EvilTerran> i think ivanm >>= tomorrow in the Bed monad would make most sense
06:40:39 <ivanm> first I get into an argument with an imperative programmer who has no idea what he's talking about, and now the FP fanbois are criticing how I choose to condense my messages
06:40:39 <shachaf> Maybe ivanm >>= sleep?
06:40:40 <roconnor> forever roconnor :: Bed a
06:40:43 * ivanm gives up
06:41:05 <LeCamarade> undefined
06:41:37 <roconnor> shachaf: Maybe ivanm doesn't typecheck.  You probably mean Just ivanm :P
06:42:03 <LeCamarade> undefined || fmap bed ivanm
06:42:11 <shachaf> Just (go ivanm bed)
06:42:49 <fasta> Is it bad jokes day? ;)
06:43:33 <Syzygy-> Seems that way.
06:44:09 <ZeD> hello there, how do you split up a list into two (or more) other lists? Then I'd need to add these lists into a list of lists..
06:45:00 <TSC> How do you want to split it?
06:45:14 <roconnor> @type group
06:45:16 <ZeD> given an Integer parameter
06:45:16 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => [a] -> [[a]]
06:45:18 <LeCamarade> > break (== ' ') "every little thing"
06:45:19 <lambdabot>  ("every"," little thing")
06:45:22 <LeCamarade> Like that?
06:45:28 <TSC> splitAt?
06:45:46 <roconnor> ZeD: I've written that function sooooooo many time :(
06:45:52 <TSC> > splitAt 5 [1..10]
06:45:53 <lambdabot>  ([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10])
06:46:04 <ZeD> haha
06:46:17 <ZeD> yeah but splitAt 5 returns a pair of lists
06:46:44 <TSC> > let (a,b) = splitAt 5 [1..10] in [a,b]
06:46:45 <lambdabot>  [[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10]]
06:46:46 <ZeD> how do you "extract" each of the pairs and add them into a list?
06:47:04 <ZeD> TSC: cheers
06:47:30 <EvilTerran> > transpose (splitAt 5 [1..10])
06:47:31 <lambdabot>  Couldn't match expected type `[[a]]'
06:47:58 <EvilTerran> > transpose (let (a,b) = splitAt 5 [1..10] in [a,b])
06:47:59 <lambdabot>  [[1,6],[2,7],[3,8],[4,9],[5,10]]
06:48:25 <roconnor>  unfoldr block
06:48:25 <roconnor> where
06:48:25 <roconnor>   block [] = Nothing
06:48:25 <roconnor>   block x = Just $ splitAt blockSize x
06:48:50 <roconnor> that's what I wrote last time.
06:48:53 * earthy nods
06:49:01 <roconnor> probably a better way
06:49:17 <ZeD> cheers, that's more than enough, now i have to figure out what each one of them does and then will use the one that seems to be the best
06:49:24 * earthy grins
06:49:31 <earthy> timtowtdi
06:52:58 <MyCatSchemes> Hrmn. How do I coerce String -> FilePath? Sure I'm missing something obvious here.
06:53:14 <roconnor> MyCatSchemes: id :D
06:53:26 <MyCatSchemes> roconnor: you're shitting me.
06:53:32 <roconnor> @type id :: String -> FilePath
06:53:33 <MyCatSchemes> roconnor: that's beautiful if you're not.
06:53:34 <lambdabot> String -> FilePath :: String -> FilePath
06:53:41 <roconnor> woa
06:53:41 <MyCatSchemes> ...nice!
06:53:47 <roconnor> I broke lambdabot
06:53:49 <twanvl> ?src FilePath
06:53:49 <lambdabot> type FilePath = String
06:54:07 <roconnor> twanvl: ah, that's a more clear answer
06:55:19 <roconnor> @type "::"
06:55:20 <lambdabot> [Char]
06:56:08 <ski> @type (::)
06:56:10 <lambdabot> parse error on input `::'
06:56:11 <twanvl> ?type id . id :: id -> id
06:56:13 <lambdabot> id -> id :: forall id. id -> id
06:56:58 <roconnor> twanvl: there is something broken about extacting and displaying the type
06:57:05 <roconnor> @type 7 :: Integer
06:57:07 <lambdabot> Integer :: Integer
06:57:14 <ski> @type (7 :: Integer)
06:57:15 <lambdabot> Integer
07:01:07 <MyCatSchemes> The Hell. I'm allowed to put "let" statements inside a "do" expression, right?
07:01:11 * MyCatSchemes pokes GHC.
07:01:40 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: yes, both let statements and let expressions
07:01:46 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: just don't get the to confused
07:01:48 <twanvl> I think it somehow strips everything before the second-to-last ::
07:02:24 <MyCatSchemes> quicksilver: what's the difference? let x = foo in... versus let x = foo; bar <- baz; boggle bar; return ();... ?
07:04:01 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: nothing
07:04:09 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: just indentation + the use of the word 'in'
07:04:28 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: the latter is desugared to the former
07:05:08 <quicksilver> MyCatSchemes: the main gotcha is accidentally using the 'in' form and not indenting it further
07:05:19 <MyCatSchemes> quicksilver: ah, I see. Heh.
07:05:20 <quicksilver> then you've written do { let x = foo; in bar }
07:05:23 <quicksilver> and that's illegal
07:05:32 <quicksilver> cos you're starting a statement with in
07:05:43 <quicksilver> but do {let x = foo; bar} and do {let x = foo in bar} are both fine
07:11:06 <MyCatSchemes> quicksilver: please could you help me diagnose this error? I'm getting "last statement in a do construct must be an expression" and I don't understand why. Spot any egrerious errors in there? http://hpaste.org/3453
07:11:53 <MyCatSchemes> Am I using "let" wrong or something? The compiler pinpoints the specific line just after the let statement.
07:11:55 <sorear> MyCatSchemes: (without looking at the code) Layout issue.
07:12:15 <MyCatSchemes> sorear: it's all at the same indentation level. >>
07:12:42 <Botje> MyCatSchemes:  there are 3 ) but only 2 ( on that line
07:13:03 * MyCatSchemes facepalms.
07:13:08 * MyCatSchemes hugs Botje.
07:13:26 <Botje> :)
07:13:30 <MyCatSchemes> I rewrote that backwards and forwards about three times already without spotting that. Heh.
07:13:47 <quicksilver> I'm not really sure why the error isn't "unexpected )" though
07:13:54 <quicksilver> that would be a bit more obvious...
07:14:06 <Botje> it's a trick
07:15:28 <vincenz> roconnor: ping
07:15:46 <vincenz> roconnor: what's the dual of 2?
07:16:01 <vincenz> (in the sense that the dual of a*b = a+b)
07:17:10 <opqdonut> huh in what sense is that?
07:17:34 <opqdonut> log(2) comes to mind since log(a*b)=log(a)+log(b)
07:17:44 <opqdonut> but i probably don't know what you're talking about
07:17:45 <roconnor> vincenz: I can't think of a context where 2 has a dual
07:18:03 <twanvl> dual 2 = dual (1+1) = (dual 1) * (dual 1) = ?
07:18:19 <roconnor> dual 1 = 0
07:18:51 <vincenz> and the dual of a list?
07:18:53 <MyCatSchemes> Hmmmhmmmmhmmmm... sweet, beautiful music. ^_^
07:18:55 <vincenz> or erm
07:19:06 <vincenz> dual 1 = 0?
07:19:06 <vincenz> so
07:19:12 <vincenz> dual (1+x) = 0.x = 0?
07:19:35 <MyCatSchemes> Dual?
07:19:38 <roconnor> well, duals mean different things in different contexts
07:19:54 <sorear> suppose we have an operator f : R -> R such that f x + f y = f (x * y) /\ f x * f y = f (x + y).  f 0 = f (0 * 0) = f 0 + f 0 = 0; f x = f (x + 0) = f x * f 0 = 0.
07:20:07 <EvilTerran> isn't a dual any function that's its own inverse on a type?
07:20:17 <sorear> thus for any ring such a function is identically zero
07:20:46 <EvilTerran> (preferrably excluding id)
07:20:59 <vincenz> sorear: good point
07:21:21 <Eelis> the dual of an operation on a partial order is the operation you get when you flip the order upside-down, iirc
07:21:33 <Eelis> but that is obviously just one context
07:22:10 <roconnor> yeah, the dual of a*b ought to be (1-(1-a)*(1-b)) = a*b - a - b
07:22:30 <vincenz> I was just trying to find the dual of a list and then hit the issue of 1 becoming 0
07:22:37 <MyCatSchemes> roconnor: is this the sense of "dual" where, for example, in ring theory, there's a dual of the entity zero and a dual of the operation + :: m -> m -> m?
07:22:46 <vincenz> mu x.1+a.x => mu x.0.(a+x) = mu x. 0
07:23:06 <MyCatSchemes> roconnor: or is this the sense of "dual" where dual = \foo -> "co"+foo -- which is to say, flipping every arrow. :)
07:23:29 <roconnor> MyCatSchemes: Not sure.  We had better ask vincenz
07:23:32 <vincenz> MyCatSchemes: the latter since I'm asking
07:23:51 <MyCatSchemes> vincenz: ahhh. Category theory hurts my brain.
07:23:59 <vincenz> I know nothing of it
07:24:05 <MyCatSchemes> I mean, literally. Last time I tried reading up on it, I got headaches.
07:24:05 <vincenz> was just trying to work out the math for a lists
07:24:09 <vincenz> since co a+b = a.b
07:24:22 <roconnor> vincenz: duals work better in classical math than constructive math
07:24:34 <vincenz> roconnor: lists are constructive math?
07:24:40 <MyCatSchemes> *Literally*. As in, sit on train, no headache. Pick up book, no headache. Read book, headache. Headache lasts for another hour and a half after putting book down. :)
07:24:48 <roconnor> vincenz: and lists are constructive math because they have more than one object in thier type.
07:25:01 <roconnor> + is pretty constructive too.
07:25:26 * roconnor ponders that
07:25:43 <vincenz> woosh
07:26:06 <roconnor> I wonder if + for algebraic types is really dual to *
07:26:17 <roconnor> it certainly seems that way in many respects.
07:27:55 <MyCatSchemes> Hrmn. Thinking of interactivity, I was wondering...
07:28:14 <opqdonut> well in the sense that (F\{0},*) and (F,+) are isomorphic for pretty much any numeric F
07:28:26 <vincenz> just curious what the dual of a list is
07:28:27 <roconnor> vincenz: some thoughts: 1 + anything 's dual is 0 in the sense that 1 + anything is always inhabitied, so that it's dual is never inhabited.
07:29:04 <vincenz> why is 1+anything  more or less inhabited than anything?
07:29:18 <roconnor> because left () is alway a member of 1 + X
07:29:28 <MyCatSchemes> I have a process here which does forkProcess (executeProcess blah blah blah....), and then immediately getProcessStatus. The program which is being exec()ed runs for about a minute and a half. I was pondering, would it be a good idea to put performGC in between the forkprocess and the getstatus?
07:29:28 <vincenz> ah
07:29:40 <roconnor> of in the case of list, [] is always a list
07:29:42 <vincenz> ok, was seeing 'inhabited' the wrong way
07:29:52 <vincenz> so the dual of most sane types are nonexistent?
07:30:21 <roconnor> that's what I think.  Although I'm not certain I have the right definition of dual here.
07:30:32 <roconnor> I don't know catagory theory.
07:30:38 <vincenz> nor I :|
07:30:47 <opqdonut> :D
07:30:57 <roconnor> It's like philosophers talking about math.
07:30:58 <vincenz> well the reason I was thinking of this, I Was thinking of duality of + and * in set theory (union and intersect)
07:31:05 <vincenz> and
07:31:10 <vincenz> I have a list of intersects
07:31:15 <vincenz> so that would be an XXX of unions
07:31:18 <vincenz> where xxx = ?
07:31:36 <roconnor> a list of products?
07:31:49 <vincenz> a list of splits
07:32:04 <roconnor> ok
07:32:20 <wli> Sum of products representation?
07:32:20 <vincenz>  I wondered what the dual of that is
07:32:31 <vincenz> more concretely.
07:32:38 <vincenz> Take a problemspace you're trying to find a solution in
07:32:43 <vincenz> there's a dual approach
07:32:49 <roconnor> right
07:32:50 <vincenz> bottom up: you try to get specific instances
07:32:52 <wli> Product-of-sums?
07:32:56 <vincenz> wait
07:33:05 <vincenz> specific instances, so unioning singletons
07:33:10 <vincenz> but when you ocus, you pick one
07:33:12 <vincenz> dually
07:33:14 <vincenz> top-down
07:33:18 <vincenz> a list of splits in your searchspace
07:33:25 <vincenz> focussing means: making a choice on each splt
07:33:42 <vincenz> the top-down has two concepts, so I miss a concept in the bottom-up
07:33:52 <vincenz> (the concepts being: list of splits and making a choioce in each)
07:34:26 <roconnor> is your list non-empty?
07:34:34 <vincenz> not peres
07:34:38 <vincenz> perse
07:34:44 <roconnor> ok
07:35:47 <vincenz> no splits would just not give you much info in finding a solutin
07:35:58 <vincenz> ths is rather fuzzy tho
07:36:23 <phlpp> seems like most guys in here come from europe, eh?
07:36:44 <vincenz> nah
07:37:06 <jedbrown> > Numeric.fromRat (3%7 :: Ratio Int)

07:37:32 <jedbrown> Is this a bug?
07:37:57 <opqdonut> no
07:38:05 <vincenz> It's hard to define a split, since it's not an intersection
07:38:14 <opqdonut> Numeric.fromRat ((3::Int)%(7::Int) :: Ratio Int)
07:38:19 <opqdonut> that's just integer defaulting

07:39:37 <opqdonut> type Rational = Ratio Integer
07:39:39 <opqdonut> yup
07:39:42 <jedbrown> Ah, yes it is.
07:52:00 <ski> vincenz : duals work fine in linear logic, too
07:52:37 <vincenz> yep
07:52:55 <ski> also, the dual of a property of things in an arbitrary category is the property in the opposite category
07:52:57 <vincenz> aha
07:52:58 <vincenz> roconnor: that explains
07:53:05 <vincenz> roconnor: in linear logic 1+x == 1
07:53:10 <vincenz> roconnor: in types this is not so
07:53:30 <ski> vincenz : ?
07:53:32 <roconnor> 1 + x == 1 would be helpful
07:53:39 <roconnor> it is a classical property
07:53:54 <roconnor> in the sense that 1 + x is inhabited exactly when 1 is inhabited.
07:53:57 <ski> vincenz : `1' and `+' being ?
07:54:03 <vincenz> 1 = ()
07:54:06 <vincenz> + = Either
07:54:33 <ski> (oh, i was thinking `==' meant "isomorphic")
07:54:59 <roconnor> vincenz: 1 + x == 1 in linear logic?
07:55:07 <vincenz> sure
07:55:10 <vincenz> true or a = true
07:56:12 <ski> is `=' still "inhabited exactly when" ?
07:56:34 <roconnor> ski: is  1 + x == 1 in linear logic?
07:56:44 <roconnor> vincenz: do you mean classical logic?
07:56:47 <vincenz> yes
07:56:52 <vincenz> this is not linear logic?
07:56:54 <roconnor> *whew*
07:56:56 <ski> roconnor : define `1', `+', and `==' first :)
07:57:21 <roconnor> liner logic < constructive logic < classical logic
07:57:28 <vincenz> roconnor: ah, thanks
07:57:29 <roconnor> or use > if you prefer the dual ;)
07:57:31 <vincenz> where < = ?
07:57:35 <vincenz> less assumptions?
07:57:58 <roconnor> less proofs.
07:58:08 <roconnor> but the comparison is a bit touchy.
07:58:12 * vincenz nods
07:58:22 <vincenz> but
07:58:24 <roconnor> it invovles intepretting operators from one logic in another
07:58:30 <roconnor> which isn't really fair
07:58:32 <vincenz> all theories that hold for linear hold for classical?
07:58:32 * ski ponders whether the first `<' holds
07:59:14 <ski> roconnor : yes, you have to specify how to map the connectives
07:59:14 <roconnor> vincenz: I think so.  if A -o X then I think A -> X
07:59:31 <vincenz> roconnor: thanks, ,that clarifies < :)
08:00:30 <ski> in linear logic, `|- ((A -o _|_) -o _|_) -o A'
08:00:45 <roconnor> ski oh right
08:00:49 <roconnor> damn
08:00:55 <ski> roconnor : what do you translate that into, in whatever constructive logic you intend ?
08:01:16 <ski> (:
08:01:31 <twanvl> isn't that just in classical linear logic?
08:01:41 <roconnor> maybe I should say something like A < B when A has more refined connectives than B
08:01:53 <roconnor> or just more connectives
08:02:06 <roconnor> anyhow, my linear logic is pretty weak.
08:02:30 <vincenz> anywho
08:02:35 <vincenz> back to types :)
08:02:45 <vincenz> so types are constructive logic?
08:02:47 <ski> "back" ?
08:02:54 <vincenz> duality of a list
08:03:18 <EvilTerran> if you can get a concept of entailment in all your logics, then logic_A < logic_B could mean "if (P entails Q) can be proven in A, then it can be proven in B"
08:03:37 <EvilTerran> anyway. yes, types! on-topic! honest!
08:03:48 <vincenz> EvilTerran: exactly
08:03:51 <vincenz> (the prior)
08:03:54 <vincenz> what I was thinking for <
08:04:02 <ski> EvilTerran : you still need to map connectives between the logics
08:04:15 <vincenz> ski: what is a connective?
08:04:37 <EvilTerran> hm... yes, i guess you need a way of turning (P in logic A) into (P in logic B)
08:04:56 <vincenz> well there's pretty std ones: or, implies, and
08:05:01 <ski> `True',`False',`~',`/\',`\/',`->',`<->'
08:05:20 <ski> EvilTerran : or vice versa :)
08:05:33 <EvilTerran> indeed
08:06:57 <vincenz> ski: aren't they define in all logics?
08:07:18 <ski> vincenz : some have more
08:07:31 <ski> (and some have less)
08:07:39 <EvilTerran> linear gives 'em all different names
08:07:45 <ski> no
08:07:57 <ski> linear logic *splits* some of them in two
08:09:30 <ski> ~[~a]  =  ~ (mu as. Top + (~a (*) as))  =  nu nas. ~(Top + ~a (*) ~nas)  =  Bot * (~a (+) nas)  -- i'd guess
08:10:24 <ski> er, "=  Bot * (a (+) nas)", typo
08:10:53 <roconnor> vincenz: types are constructive logic!!1!
08:11:09 * roconnor gets excited
08:11:14 <vincenz> \o/
08:11:20 <vincenz> roconnor: whence this discovery?
08:11:24 <ski> so, given a value in this type, you can either choose to die, or to get a value in `a', interacting with a new "co-list" of `a's
08:11:43 <roconnor> curry howard
08:12:05 <MattForshaw> afternoon guys
08:12:16 <ski> (s/die/local die/)
08:12:17 <MattForshaw> how's it going?
08:12:41 <MattForshaw> stumped trying to figure out how to implement splitAt recursively
08:12:42 <roconnor> MattForshaw: I'm excited
08:13:20 <roconnor> @src splitAt
08:13:20 <lambdabot> splitAt n xs           =  (take n xs, drop n xs)
08:13:24 <ski> if you think about the description of a co-list, it seems to be exactly how a list is used
08:13:26 <roconnor> oh
08:13:37 <roconnor> heh
08:13:59 <roconnor> nas?
08:14:11 <ski> (here i'm assuming all elements of the list are to be used exactly once, for other variants, add exponentials)
08:14:16 <roconnor> oh bound variable
08:14:21 <ski> `n' being short for "not"
08:15:09 <roconnor> ski: presumably there is another list type where one element is used exactly once.
08:15:15 <vincenz> roconnor: whence the exitation? I'd think you'd know this since a while
08:15:39 <vincenz> (curry-howard)
08:15:41 <ski> roconnor : i think that's nicer on streams, though
08:15:48 <roconnor> vincenz: I always get excited about construct math and type theory.
08:15:53 <vincenz> :)
08:16:09 <roconnor> constructive
08:16:24 <vincenz> very
08:16:32 <ski> Stream a = nu as. a * as
08:17:03 <ski> roconnor : in your list type, must there be at least one element ?
08:17:16 <ski> s/?/ in each list ?/
08:17:29 <EvilTerran> @users
08:17:29 <lambdabot> Maximum users seen in #haskell: 420, currently: 384 (91.4%), active: 12 (3.1%)
08:18:02 <roconnor> ski: Wait the defintion of list uses both + and *
08:18:09 <roconnor> so there are 4 linear varients
08:18:23 * roconnor boggles
08:18:50 <ski> (you could vary the `1' too, but possibly you want that to covary with `*')
08:19:34 <ski> roconnor : sometimes there's several constructive variants of classical concepts, too
08:19:45 <roconnor> ski
08:19:50 <roconnor> ski: certainly
08:20:01 <roconnor> although usually one is obviously right
08:20:07 <roconnor> which is possibly the case here too.
08:20:11 <ski> Cauchy or Dedekind ?
08:20:19 <roconnor> Cauchy
08:20:30 <ski> ASD seems to think Dedekind
08:20:30 <roconnor> although Dedekind has some uses too.
08:20:57 <roconnor> ski: yeah, I've never understood those papers  I should reread them again.
08:21:59 <ski> roconnor : anyway .. possibly a "just one element"-list can be useful too .. what do you think about empty lists, then ?
08:22:07 <roconnor> but the Dedekind reals have infinity and minus infinity
08:22:12 <roconnor> and the reals don't
08:22:27 <roconnor> so the dedekind reals are obviously not the reals
08:22:48 <dons> ?yow!
08:22:48 <lambdabot> Sometime in 1993 NANCY SINATRA will lead a BLOODLESS COUP on GUAM!!
08:23:01 <vincenz> roconnor: any good intro papers?
08:23:21 <roconnor> vincenz: intro to what?
08:23:30 <vincenz> roconnor: cauchy dedekind, constructive math
08:23:48 <ski> roconnor : the ASD reals seems to not be compact, from what i understand (which is admittedly not much)
08:24:38 <roconnor> ski: yeah, I forget if the ASD reals are locateded dedekind cuts or not.
08:24:49 <roconnor> ski: by advisor said they were located.
08:24:58 <roconnor> which throws out the infinites
08:25:03 <roconnor> and makes them Cauchy reals
08:25:23 <roconnor> however they are only Cauchy reals under the assumption of some axiom of choice
08:25:47 <roconnor> but I have not good model of the constructive axiom of choice not holding
08:25:51 <EvilTerran> @where hatanim
08:25:51 <lambdabot> I know nothing about hatanim.
08:25:54 <roconnor> no good model
08:26:14 <roconnor> so I say, screw that distinction.
08:27:06 <roconnor> ... my point is that I understand that ASD reals are located dedekind cuts, which are (as far as I'm concerened) Cauchy reals.
08:27:58 <roconnor> vincenz: I don't think I know a good introduction to the Cauchy Dedekind debate.
08:28:24 <roconnor> vincenz: there is Bishop and Bridges book on Constructive Analysis if you want (one) introduction to constructive analysis.
08:28:52 * roconnor >>= bowling
08:29:53 <EvilTerran> hm. wasn't there some kinda --local flag to Cabal ./configure scripts for when you aren't root?
08:29:53 <vincenz> roconnor: binding yourself to it?
08:29:55 <vincenz> sounds painful
08:30:09 <EvilTerran> it seems to not be there in the one i'm looking at
08:30:30 <ski> AList a = (n : N) (*) (((m : N) (*) m < n) -o a)  -- should work, but it seems one could do better

08:33:10 <EvilTerran> i'll see if just --prefix'ing it to a directory in ~ will work
08:34:25 <zipMe> dons : wow ! too bad I suck at haskell
08:35:17 <EvilTerran> hm. for some reason, the hat makefile seems to have the line "606" in it
08:35:29 <EvilTerran> and make is, predictably, choking on this somewhat
08:35:55 <dons> zipMe: better get your skills up :)
08:36:08 <ricky_clarkson> EvilTerran: I love random :wq in files.
08:36:46 <zipMe> dons : actually I'm going to apply, what the hell :)
08:36:52 <EvilTerran> er? in vi or suchlike ,you mean?
08:37:14 <ricky_clarkson> Yes.  Some people forget to press escape and type :wq in insert mode.
08:37:41 <osfameron> er, yes, that happens to me all the time (with :x though)
08:37:48 <Botje> so you do :imap :wq <Escape>:wq
08:37:50 <osfameron> but then I usually notice and delete it before saving again
08:37:54 <Botje> and problem solved :)
08:37:58 <osfameron> hehe
08:38:03 <dons> zipMe: looks to me like they're using haskell to select for good candidates though
08:38:31 <osfameron> the pay looks rubbish though
08:38:44 <ricky_clarkson> Is that the job in Nottingham?
08:38:45 <zipMe> dons : not a bad idea, I can't blame them
08:38:53 <osfameron> ok, well maybe it's Nottingham, but if they're looking for someone really good, they should be paying more
08:38:57 <ricky_clarkson> I expect Nottingham has low living costs.
08:39:20 <zipMe> osfameron : well I'm mediocre, and the pay suits me fine
08:39:34 <osfameron> zipMe: are you already in Nottingham?
08:39:36 <malcolmw> EvilTerran: the cpp-based detection of ghc version has screwed up (in Hat), that's all
08:39:47 <liyang> Beeston is a lovely English town.
08:39:52 <zipMe> ricky_clarkson : they says you can work from anywhere
08:39:53 <osfameron> ah, it does suggest home working possibility
08:40:01 * liyang never heard of Red Nucleus...
08:40:06 <ricky_clarkson> Then move to India.
08:40:11 <zipMe> osfameron : and part-time
08:40:20 <EvilTerran> malcolmw, how do i fix this?
08:40:37 <malcolmw> edit the config file?
08:40:46 <zipMe> osfameron : no, in Nantes France :)
08:41:09 <osfameron> zipMe: ah!  Well I have no idea what the cost of living is in Nantes :-)
08:41:15 <malcolmw> EvilTerran: i.e. lib/$machine/config
08:41:21 <liyang> (FYI: you don't get shot in Beeston. That's Radford.)
08:41:31 <zipMe> osfameron : but I'm planning a move abroad next year, maybe in the UK, Nottingham is the Town of Napalm Death, why not ???
08:42:19 <zipMe> osfameron : cost of living in Nantes : low, low, low
08:42:20 <chessguy> so do they still have someone in the position of Sheriff of Nottingham?
08:42:28 <osfameron> zipMe: fair enough.  I suppose it's *from* 22K and who knows what the bonus is in a startup.  But it does seem little to finance an expatriation.
08:42:32 <EvilTerran> malcolmw, ah, that's where the screwy line is. what should i do with it, delete it?
08:43:11 <zipMe> osfameron :  yes, expatriatio needs to be computed independently
08:43:14 <ricky_clarkson> 22K for a part time job seems fine.
08:43:18 <malcolmw> EvilTerran: the "606" should be on the same line as GHCSYM= or something like that
08:43:42 <malcolmw> delete the rubbish in between (if there is any)
08:43:43 <EvilTerran> ah, okay
08:43:54 <osfameron> I read it as 22K pro-rata though, so would be less part time?
08:44:22 <EvilTerran> "hmake: command not found" O.o
08:44:41 <chessguy> what's pro-rata mean?
08:44:42 <zipMe> osfameron : I guess so... that's not much left
08:44:50 <malcolmw> EvilTerran: so try installing hmake?
08:44:59 <EvilTerran> ah, okay
08:45:16 <ricky_clarkson> chessguy: e.g., if you get paid 22k pro-rata but work a 50% job you get 11k.
08:45:18 <EvilTerran> i thought that might be a case of "edit a config file to use a different name for hmake"

09:06:23 <Corun> Hi, I'm trying to install lambdabot, but I've come across some strange trouble involve fps. http://rafb.net/p/GkL4a845.html
09:06:25 <lambdabot> Title: Nopaste - No description
09:06:38 <Corun> Any thoughts, anyone?
09:06:40 <phlpp> @type fmap
09:06:46 <lambdabot> forall a b (f :: * -> *). (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
09:08:32 <shapr> Corun: What's imported as B in BotPP.hs ?
09:08:46 <quicksilver> ByteString, I imagine
09:08:56 <quicksilver> I think this is a minor API change but I don't recall how you fix it
09:08:57 <shapr> Corun: Are you the dual of run? :-)
09:09:08 * shapr tries to build lambdabot
09:09:10 <Corun> import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as B -- crank it up, yeah!
09:09:30 <shapr> Corun: Are you using ghc 6.6.1?
09:09:45 <Corun> 6.6.3 I think
09:09:51 <shapr> really!
09:09:58 <shapr> Corun: Try "ghc --version"
09:09:58 <Corun> Er, nope :-P
09:10:00 <Corun> 6.6.1 :-)
09:10:02 <shapr> whew
09:10:13 <Corun> Actually it says "The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.6"
09:10:19 <shapr> Since I've never heard of that version, and I thougt I was well connected in the Haskell community, I was worried for a bit!
09:10:39 <shapr> Corun: 6.6.1 will make your life easier, are you using one of the Linux distros that have that package?
09:10:48 <Corun> I'm using debian
09:10:52 <shapr> debian/unstable?
09:10:54 <EvilTerran> "Failed to load interface for `Prelude':
09:11:05 <EvilTerran> Perhaps you haven't installed the profiling libraries for package base?"
09:11:07 <EvilTerran> O.o
09:11:14 <shapr> EvilTerran: Using debian?
09:11:21 <EvilTerran> fedora 7
09:11:25 <sorear> 09:10 < Corun> I'm using debian
09:11:25 <sorear> 09:10 < shapr> debian/unstable?
09:11:29 <sorear> oh.
09:11:29 <shapr> Corun: Anyway, try "apt-get -uf install ghc6"
09:11:32 <EvilTerran> x86_64
09:11:38 <Corun> Ah, that's why I thought it was 6.6.3: the package is: ghc6 6.6-3
09:11:46 * Corun tries things
09:12:06 <shapr> Corun: If you're using stable, you may be stuck with 6.6, but 6.6.1 is in unstable.
09:12:25 <shapr> I've been using debian/unstable exclusively for the past five years or so.
09:12:34 <sorear> Corun: Why do you want to install lambdabot?  She's a pain to build and doesn't support installation.
09:12:40 <shapr> Very featureful, but occasionally a bit too exciting.
09:12:57 <shapr> sorear: I wonder how hard it would be to fix that?
09:13:18 <shapr> Not that I have time to even look at that today...
09:13:22 <sorear> shapr: extremely, since nobody can go into lambdabot's innards without noseplugs anymore
09:13:32 <shapr> Still looks familiar to me :-)
09:13:36 <shapr> I'm guess I'm used to the smell.
09:14:16 <dons> btw, lambdabot has moved to code.haskell.org/lambdabot

09:18:59 <shapr> matthew_-: If you put a penguin on a scanner, you have a scanned in avian.
09:19:05 <EvilTerran> ok, so what can  i do about that error, anyway?
09:19:38 <shapr> matthew_-: It started out as a joke, I told people that I was a linux lover (penguin) living on the internet, and at the time I had just moved from Finland to Sweden, so I was a scandinavian as well as a scanned in avian.
09:20:07 <shapr> Corun: Can you get ghc 6.6.1?
09:20:15 <matthew_-> yes, I worked out most of that joke
09:20:21 <shapr> EvilTerran: Do you have a profiling package?
09:20:34 <EvilTerran> i'm guessing not
09:20:39 <EvilTerran> how do i tell?
09:20:49 <matthew_-> I would hyphenate the scanned-in, otherwise it's like you've been scanned whilst being in the belly of an avian
09:21:01 <shapr> EvilTerran: debian has libghc6-fgl-dev as well as libghc6-fgl-prof
09:21:26 <shapr> matthew_-: I dunno, no one has ever mistaken it for that before.
09:21:34 <Corun> I dunno shapr, I'm just getting the more recent lambdabot source first
09:21:55 <shapr> On the other hand, people do get very confused about my domain name sometimes. I'm surprised, I thought it was simple, obvious, and funny enough that no one would forget how to spell it.
09:22:09 <Corun> What's your domain?
09:22:17 <shapr> ScannedInAvian
09:22:21 <EvilTerran> ... so a profiling package is a flavour of compiler, not something i can yoink off hackage and build into my ~?
09:22:33 <shapr> EvilTerran: No, it's something you can yoink and build.

09:22:45 <lambdabot> Title: Urban Dictionary: yoink
09:22:56 <shapr> EvilTerran: cabal supports building profiling, but you'll need the base libraries built with profiling also.
09:24:58 <dylan> shapr: I thought you lived in a bird too.
09:25:07 <shapr> dylan: bah
09:25:15 * shapr throws feathers at dylan
09:26:00 <dylan> No, Sgeo. :)
09:26:11 <Sgeo> No dylan
09:26:25 <Sgeo> :)
09:26:40 <shapr> EvilTerran: try "locate .p_hi" to see if you already have the profiling base libraries installed. For example, "locate .p_hi|grep Maybe" could be useful.
09:26:59 * ski thought the "in" was "inside"
09:27:02 <shapr> EvilTerran: Found anything?
09:27:05 <EvilTerran> nowt
09:27:12 <EvilTerran> locate .p_hi finds nothing at all
09:27:34 <shapr> EvilTerran: debian has ghc6 and ghc6-prof, maybe FC7 also has a separate package for profiling libs?
09:27:48 <EvilTerran> meh. i'll sort it out later, i have to go (grr)
09:27:54 <EvilTerran> thanks for your help

09:39:37 <centrinia> It's raining and it is too cold for ice cream. :(
09:40:41 <sorear> centrinia: You can't even say it's possible.  Machine 1 in Turing's ladder (does this actually have a name?  I mean the transfinite construction obtained by adding halting oracles) can emulate machine 0 in O(1), but machine 0 cannot emulate machine 1 at all.

09:49:22 <tga> howdy
09:52:04 <shapr> hiya tga
09:53:14 <tga> I'm trying a few simple things in Haskell and I think I'm a bit off with the syntax
09:53:21 <tga> what's the right way of doing something like
09:53:27 <tga> convert ds = last(ds) + 10*convert(init(ds))
09:54:08 <vincenz> convert ds = last ds + 10 * convert (init ds)
09:54:26 <vincenz> no need for the (ds)
09:54:33 <vincenz> or even better
09:54:43 <vincenz> convert ds = convert' . revert $ ds
09:55:01 <vincenz>   where convert' d:ds = d + 10 * convert' ds
09:55:09 <vincenz> s/revert/reverse/
09:55:22 <vincenz> or even better
09:55:27 <tga> a-ha, I was wondering whether something like convert ds:d = d+10*convert(ds) would work
09:55:39 <vincenz> > foldl (\a b -> a + 10*b) 0 [1,2,3]
09:55:41 <lambdabot>  60
09:55:41 <tga> I tried your first convert though, and I get a *** Exception: Prelude.last: empty list
09:56:01 <vincenz> > foldl (\a b -> 10*a + b) 0 [1,2,3]
09:56:02 <lambdabot>  123
09:56:28 <vincenz> @pl \a b -> 10*a + b
09:56:28 <lambdabot> (+) . (10 *)
09:56:47 <vincenz> > foldl ((+) . (10*)) 0 [1,2,3]

09:56:55 <lambdabot>  <IO ()>
09:57:22 <vincenz> MyCatSchemes: buggy
09:57:26 <vincenz> you're missing "" around the string
09:57:43 <tga> vincenz: why would convert ds = last ds + 10 * convert (init ds) bomb with that exception though?
09:57:53 <MyCatSchemes> vincenz: noooo, even better! Demontrates GHC's wonderful type inference errors on the commandline! ;)
09:57:55 <vincenz> tga: what exception?
09:57:59 <vincenz> tga: and what are you using as test data?
09:58:05 <tga> convert [1,2,3]
09:58:15 <vincenz> > init [1,2,3]
09:58:16 <lambdabot>  [1,2]
09:58:20 <oerjan> tga: both your and vincenz's version need another test case for empty lists

10:09:44 <centrinia> ricky, Yeah.
10:09:49 <n00b> why two lets ???
10:10:05 <oerjan> the original you wrote before trying to put it into lambdabot was correct as a top level declaration, iirc
10:10:19 <oerjan> but you need to put a let ... in around _all_ of that
10:10:24 <oerjan> to give it to >
10:10:41 <oerjan> including around the let in that was in there at the beginning
10:10:59 <oerjan> because your function definition itself uses a let inside
10:11:00 <bakert> anyone know what "    Conflicting definitions for `.'" means?
10:11:23 <puusorsa> you have (.) defined more than once?
10:11:34 <bakert> puusorsa: i'm not defininig (.)!
10:11:35 <oerjan> bakert: did you do something like a . b = ... somewhere?
10:11:37 <bakert> i dn't think
10:11:40 <bakert> :(
10:11:46 <puusorsa> me neither
10:11:52 <centrinia> Maybe you have another import that does that.
10:11:57 <centrinia> Try removing import statements.
10:12:15 <n00b> how ???
10:12:18 <bakert> it actually tells me where it is bound
10:12:20 <centrinia> -- import Prelude.
10:12:31 <bakert> it's in the middle of a list
10:12:37 <bakert> i must have screwed up the syntax somehow
10:12:43 <n00b> unzip ((a, b):rest) = let (as, bs) = unzip rest  in (a:as, b:bs)
10:12:49 <bakert> no it's not in a list.  it's amongst some let statements

10:12:54 <centrinia> Did you type `.' like that?
10:13:05 <bakert> centrinia: that came from copy and paste from ghc
10:13:08 <centrinia> Or did you type `.` ?
10:13:09 <n00b>  > unzip ((a, b):rest) = let (as, bs) = unzip rest  in (a:as, b:bs)
10:13:11 <centrinia> Ohh.
10:13:21 <sorear> n00b: correct
10:13:28 <sorear> well, the code is
10:13:29 <vincenz> bakert: not really
10:13:35 <vincenz> bakert: personally I think that where's are clear
10:13:36 <oerjan> > let unzip [] = ([], []); unzip ((a, b):rest) = let (as, bs) = unzip rest in (a:as, b:bs) in unzip ([1,1,44,4,4,4,4,4], [2,2,4,3,2,2,2,2])

10:13:58 <sorear> oerjan: you have zip and unzip confused I think
10:14:13 <bakert> god knows where those "." are coming from.  they ain't in the source code!
10:14:25 <bakert> do i have to comma-delimit sets of let-ed variables or something?
10:14:29 <oerjan> sorear: i was just using n00b's function
10:14:33 <oerjan> um...
10:14:36 <centrinia> bakert, are you using lhs?
10:14:37 <roconnor> @check \a b rest -> unzip ((a, b):rest) == let (as, bs) = unzip (rest::[(Int,Int)])  in (a:as, b:bs)
10:14:39 <lambdabot>  OK, passed 500 tests.
10:14:45 <bakert> centrinia: not on purpose!
10:14:54 <centrinia> No, I mean Literate Haskell.
10:14:57 <n00b>  let unzip ((a, b):rest) = let (as, bs) = unzip rest  in (a:as, b:bs) in unzip (([1,2,2],[2,2,2]))

10:15:33 <bakert> centrinia: i knew what you mean :)
10:15:36 <sorear> oerjan: incorrectly.  you don't bass two lists to unzip.
10:15:39 <oerjan> that's it
10:15:47 <bakert> i think i have just misunderstood let syntax
10:15:57 <bakert> when defining more than one value
10:16:05 <oerjan> n00b: we got the argument and result switched when trying it
10:16:05 <bakert> a newline is not enough?
10:16:06 <sorear> you use ;

10:29:51 <MyCatSchemes> What... the... HELL?
10:30:28 <MyCatSchemes> ghc just started emitting overlapped pattern warnings on a function which I haven't altered anytime since the previous (warning-free) compile.
10:30:55 <MyCatSchemes> This resulted in me staring at it for two or three minutes to ascertain that, bloody Hell, is my compiler smoking something?
10:31:14 <dons> try cleaning first
10:31:25 <MyCatSchemes> Without -touching- that function itself, the warnings just spontaneously went away again on their own.
10:31:51 <MyCatSchemes> Is GHC taking over the random number God's job of driving me insane, since I'm no longer playing Nethack now?
10:33:42 <MyCatSchemes> AHHH, IT CAME BACK AGAIN!

10:38:47 <MyCatSchemes> conal: ghc.
10:38:59 <MyCatSchemes> oerjan: that's just in there in case I ever add more constructors, and forget to add them. :)
10:39:19 <conal> MyCatSchemes: i second dons's suggestion then.
10:39:27 <MyCatSchemes> Is there a way, perhaps with a {- GHC OPTIONS -} flag, to make sure that it'll warn me about an *incomplete* pattern there instead?
10:39:49 <MyCatSchemes> So that I can remove the _ case and stop panicking, I mean.
10:40:07 <conal> MyCatSchemes: I use -Wall and get warnings about incomplete patterns.
10:40:19 <oerjan> i wonder what it does if you replace the right hand side with a use of error?
10:41:25 <MyCatSchemes> conal: fair 'nuff.
10:41:56 <MyCatSchemes> oerjan: I think that's perfectly fine. It'll never run successfully, sure, but it shows that you've definately deliberately thought about the problem. :)

11:14:27 <conal> QuickCheck question: is there a conjunction operator for Property?
11:15:15 <twanvl> Not in quickcheck 1
11:15:36 <twanvl> there is one in QC2, but it is marked 'experimental'
11:15:38 <dons> conal: oh, hmm, you might want to start using QC2 then.
11:15:46 <dons> see code.haskell.org/QuickCheck
11:15:52 <dons> for where the new QC2 team is working
11:16:04 <dons> can't let john hughes have all the QC fun :(
11:16:06 <dons> :)
11:16:08 <conal> QC2 is a work in progress?
11:16:28 <dons> mostly. its based on previous QC papers
11:16:40 <conal> dons: do you have experience with it?
11:16:58 <conal> what are QC2's goals?
11:17:23 <dons> more flexible type structure, shrinking support, easier to add drivers and other generation strategies
11:17:36 <conal> nice :)
11:17:43 <dons> so i'd like to integrate parallel test drivers, and smallcheck/strictcheck generators
11:17:55 <dons> andyjgill's working on hunit-like interfaces
11:18:04 <dons> so the grand unified testing system
11:18:09 <conal> wow -- sounds great
11:24:22 <vincenz> dons: how does shrinking work?
11:24:35 <andyjgill> I'm working on a top level driver API that will let you capture progress dynamically.
11:24:43 <andyjgill> shrink :: a -> [a]
11:25:03 <andyjgill> Take a structure, and return a set of strictly smaller structures.
11:25:34 <vincenz> so it's non deterministic
11:25:35 <andyjgill> Then try all the smaller test cases.
11:26:01 <andyjgill> No, but it does search a space for a local minimum.
11:26:36 <linxu> have tuplespaces been done in haskell?
11:26:38 <vincenz> what I'm wondering is how it works with lists
11:26:44 <vincenz> I mean
11:26:48 <vincenz> take for instance the failure
11:26:51 <vincenz> [1,2,3,4,5]
11:26:58 <vincenz> and the failure is due to the '1' and '5'
11:27:04 <vincenz> will it try removing the middle bits?
11:27:45 <andyjgill> shrink [] = [] ; (x:xs) = [xs] ++ [ x' ++ xs'  | (x:xs') <- xs, x' <- shrink x ]
11:28:00 <vincenz> right, the q is simply whether QC2 does that or not :)
11:28:11 <andyjgill> hmm.
11:28:21 <vincenz> this can lead to an explosion in dimensionality
11:28:26 <andyjgill> Can you email me an example?
11:28:27 <vincenz> and it might lead to a lot of duplicates
11:28:51 <andyjgill> Yes, you can only search part of the space.
11:28:59 <eToRA|hom> is QC2 going to borrow some of the pruning ideas from (e.g.) lazy smallcheck?
11:29:02 <andyjgill> But in practice, it works well
11:29:05 * vincenz nods
11:29:45 <tritium_> Hey all... I have a GHC question, or rather, a favor
11:30:23 <tritium_> I am attempting to build happy for MacOS
11:30:41 <joelr1> evening
11:30:59 <conal> joelr1: howdy
11:31:20 <joelr1> bringert: bjorn, what parts of gf would i use to write, for example, a text adventure game? i.e. you are in a room, this and that stuff is around you, etc.
11:31:27 <joelr1> conal: howdy
11:31:33 <tritium_> It's not letting me... it says that this requires happy, I guess I need to bootstrap the parser generator?
11:31:47 <joelr1> is dons around to answer questions? :-)
11:31:54 <vincenz> joelr1: is he ever not?
11:31:58 <vincenz> joelr1: where'd you get my name, btw?
11:32:02 <joelr1> not this morning
11:32:19 <tritium_> Anyway, could someone either tell me where to get a precompiled MacOS happy or tell me what's going on and how to fix it?
11:32:29 <joelr1> vincenz: umm... don't remember, honestly, but it's either not hard to find or you revealed it to me at some point
11:32:34 <vincenz> joelr1: ok
11:32:40 <vincenz> joelr1: well I got your linkedin invite
11:32:48 <joelr1> vincenz: great!
11:32:58 <joelr1> today is my linked in day!
11:32:58 <vincenz> anywho
11:33:00 * vincenz >>= home >>= dnner
11:33:02 <dcoutts> tritium_: are you using a tarball release of happy?
11:33:08 <dcoutts> tritium_: or the darcs version
11:33:33 <conal> swiert: i'm using your Stream package.  did you intentionally swap the argument order for (!!)?
11:33:35 <tritium_> dcoutts: tarball
11:33:36 <joelr1> me added a whole bunch of haskell, erlang and ocaml people to linked in today
11:33:43 <joelr1> including conal and duncan :D
11:33:48 <bibom> hi, I am trying to compile xmobar on linux and ge Could not find module `System.FilePath.Posix". What's wrong?
11:33:50 <dcoutts> tritium_: and you've already got ghc installed right?
11:33:57 <joelr1> and dons too
11:33:59 <conal> joelr1: thanks :)
11:34:12 <joelr1> absolutely no problem
11:34:21 <tritium_> dcoutts: that's right, I tried with 6.6.1 and 5.04, neither seemed to work
11:34:28 <joelr1> conal: what do you dedicate yourself to these days? are you still with msr?
11:34:58 <dcoutts> tritium_: ok, I'm not sure I understand the problem then, since happy tarballs come with everything necessary to build, since they include the pre-generated parser
11:35:02 <tritium_> dcoutts: Setup.lhs: The program happy is required but it could not be found
11:35:14 <dcoutts> tritium_: hmm.
11:35:40 <tritium_> dcoutts: the source tarball, that is.
11:36:00 <conal> joelr1: i left msr five years ago (!).  have been through a lot of personal-growth kinds of stuff since then.  now i'm back to functional programming research with gusto.  one of my favorite projects is Eros (http://conal.net/papers/Eros).
11:36:36 <shapr> I'm going through some personal growth right now.
11:36:51 <joelr1> conal: Safari canâ€™t open the page â€œhttp://conal.net/papers/Erosâ€ because it canâ€™t find the server â€œconal.netâ€.
11:36:54 <Axioplase> And eros is fun !
11:36:56 <dcoutts> tritium_: looks like a packaging bug, try the 1.16 release
11:36:57 <shapr> In my experience anyone who's doing personal growth probably deserves morphine.
11:37:00 <joelr1> shapr :-)
11:37:14 <dcoutts> tritium_: the tarball is in fact missing the pre-generated parser source
11:37:31 <tritium_> dcoutts: 1.16 doesn't work either, with a different bug
11:37:40 <conal> joelr1: yoiks!  my server is down :p.  my little brother hosts it, and he switched machines recently.  i'll ask him.
11:38:04 <joelr1> conal: did you by chance accept my linkedin invitation?
11:38:15 <conal> joelr1: i haven't seen it yet.
11:38:22 <joelr1> ah
11:38:23 <dcoutts> tritium_: ah yes the 1.16 release used cabal-1.1.6. Hmm.
11:38:57 <conal> right now, i'm also playing with an idea for representing continuous infinite things (animation, images, etc) that allows a lot of re-use, as well as progressive refinement.  based on zippers.
11:39:40 <tritium_> Bootstrapping is such a delicate procedure...
11:40:33 <dcoutts> tritium_: you could hack it by doing: cp happy-1.16/src/Parser.hs happy-1.17/src/
11:40:55 <dcoutts> tritium_: since nothing changed in the parser code between the releases that should work
11:40:58 <tritium_> dcoutts: thx, I'll try that
11:41:02 <joelr1> conal: very interesting. is that what eros is?
11:41:06 <shapr> conal: Whoa, sounds nifty!
11:42:25 <conal> joelr1: no.  eros is a way to compose pure values (including functions) gesturally rather than syntactically.
11:42:39 <joelr1> hmm
11:42:41 <conal> it's sort of "functional programming for artists"
11:42:48 <joelr1> gesturally...
11:42:54 <tritium_> dcoutts: Nope, fails with the same bug
11:43:04 <tritium_> dcoutts: err, same error
11:43:24 <shapr> conal: Eros r0xx, my art background must be showing...
11:43:42 <conal> shapr: :)
11:44:29 <swiert> conal: No - I'd just made a mistake.
11:44:29 <lambdabot> swiert: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
11:44:39 <conal> swiert: oh!
11:44:42 <dcoutts> tritium_: ah erm, either stick the Parser.hs file in dist/build/  or  mv src/Parser.ly src/Parser.ly.bak
11:45:04 <swiert> conal: There's a new package on hackage, with the arguments in the right order.
11:45:07 <dcoutts> tritium_: I forgot, it puts generated files in dist/build not in the src tree
11:45:28 <conal> swiert: do you have a darcs repo i could pull from?
11:45:45 <tritium_> dcoutts:  ty, I'll try that
11:45:49 <swiert> conal: www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~wss/repos/Stream
11:45:53 <swiert> Off the top of my head...
11:46:34 <conal> swiert: I get "You don't have permission to access /~wss/repos/Stream/ on this server."
11:47:02 <joelr1> what's this stream package?
11:47:49 <conal> infinite lists
11:47:54 <swiert> conal: Try again. I've fixed the permissions now.
11:47:56 <joelr1> ah
11:48:11 <dons> we've 3 streams packages in haskell land :)
11:48:35 <swiert> dons: What's the third?
11:48:41 <swiert> I can think of mine, yours, and ...
11:49:31 <dons> and the arrows one
11:49:39 <dons> well, that's a Data.Stream module, anyway
11:49:55 <conal> the arrows one just went away, in favor of swiert's
11:50:00 <swiert> dons: the new arrows package uses my stream.
11:50:11 <shapr> @index Serialize
11:50:11 <lambdabot> bzzt
11:50:17 <dons> swiert: ah!
11:50:28 <dons> oh, so they were roughly the same type?
11:50:42 <swiert> dons: exactly the same type.
11:50:51 <swiert> The one and true Stream type ;)
11:50:58 <joelr1> dons: do you guys have a haskell web server on the net?
11:50:59 <dons> good. code reuse helps the environment
11:51:25 <dons> joelr1: not released as open source, no.
11:51:32 <_fang> hello, is there a system function that returns the position of an element on a list? e.g position 3 [10,2,0,3,0,2] returning 4
11:51:37 <shapr> Is there any released, planned, or even discussed Serialize class?
11:51:39 <dons> swiert: well..
11:51:43 <conal> speaking of which, i didn't find a type of infinite binary trees in a library.  so i made my own.  is there one?
11:51:47 <joelr1> dons: outside of haskell there's nginx, lighty, even mongrel

11:52:02 <byorgey> _fang: how about that? ^^
11:52:13 <joelr1> dons: i'm wondering about the performance (as always), i don't care if it's not open source
11:52:17 <mauke> > findIndex 3 [10,2,0,3,0,2]
11:52:17 <mauke> > findIndex (== 3) [10,2,0,3,0,2]
11:52:18 <lambdabot>   add an instance declaration for (Num (a -> Bool))
11:52:19 <lambdabot>  Just 3
11:52:21 <dcoutts> conal: Data.Tree does not help? it allows finite or infinite trees
11:52:32 <joelr1> dons: i'm wondering about memory use and how it withstands heavy load, if it does
11:52:40 <dons> joelr1: fine. you've seen the on in happs, haven't you?
11:52:42 <byorgey> _fang: that's a little more general (it takes a predicate instead of just an element to find)
11:52:58 <dons> that was outperforming apache last time it was benchmarked, iirc
11:53:00 <tritium_> dcoutss: I'm still having difficulty.  It actually gives me the same error... although moving Parser.ly to Parser.ly.bak without moving Parser.hs to src/ gives a different error (Setup.lhs: can't find source for Parser in ["src"])
11:53:02 <byorgey> _fang: and note that in Haskell, list indices usually start with 0
11:53:13 <joelr1> dons: mmm... i'm always suspicious about claims to outperform apache
11:53:22 <dons> shuffling strict bytestrings around + haskell threads = pretty good performance with little effort
11:53:24 <joelr1> dons: about about your closed source one?
11:53:40 <dons> the benchmarks were using apaches own concurrent user test
11:53:42 <conal> swiert: same error, both for repos and repos/Stream
11:53:46 <joelr1> dons: i'll look into the happs server.
11:53:52 <perspectivet> Is green-card still in use?
11:53:54 <swiert> conal: Hang on...
11:53:57 <dmwit> Oh, dons: I told vincenz last night that hmp3 uses hscurses as a front end.  Did I lie?
11:54:11 <swiert> conal: darcs get http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~wss/repos/Stream
11:54:11 <sorear> dmwit: it uses the same code
11:54:13 <dons> dmwit: it uses its own nano curses binding
11:54:14 <_fang> byorgey: i was guessing the starts with 0 part xD but i got an "undefined variable 'findIndex'" error on hugs. is it normal?
11:54:27 <mauke> @index findIndex
11:54:28 <lambdabot> Data.List, Data.Map
11:54:30 <sorear> dmwit: the modules were copied ten times or so before someone thought to .cabal it
11:54:35 <byorgey> _fang: you probably need to import Data.List
11:54:38 <mauke> :m +Data.List
11:54:40 <dons> joelr1: shuffling bytestrings around is a pretty simple job, i'd expect very good performance for that task
11:54:45 <swiert> conal: That works for me. Getting over http shouldn't distinguish between you and me.
11:54:46 <byorgey> mauke: does that work in hugs too?
11:54:46 <dmwit> hmmm... ok
11:54:56 <joelr1> dons: ok, thanks
11:55:02 <_fang> byorgey: how can i run it straightly from the interpreter?
11:55:03 <mauke> byorgey: no :(
11:55:14 <mauke> :also Data.List
11:55:18 <conal> swiert: yep that works.  i was trying to look via web browser
11:55:36 <perspectivet> I've got this unmaintained c++ binding that uses greencard and I'm wondering if there is a version of greencard that builds on ghc-6.6.1
11:55:37 <byorgey> _fang: I'm not familiar with hugs, you'll have to look in the documentation to find out how to load modules
11:55:40 <swiert> conal: Ah. I don't think there's an index.html or anything special there.
11:55:45 <byorgey> or maybe someone else here knows how
11:56:01 <_fang> byorgey: okay! thank you! i'll read a bit. you helped a lot already =]
11:56:18 <byorgey> wait, mauke, is :also  how you load modules in hugs?
11:56:23 <conal> swiert: and maybe there aren't the required permissions for a directory listing.
11:56:24 <mauke> yes
11:56:37 <swiert> conal: yeah. It'll be something like that.
11:56:39 <tritium_> dcoutts: AHA!  The missing preprocessed thing was AttrGrammarParser.hs
11:56:44 <byorgey> _fang: well there you go, according to mauke you can just type :also Data.List
11:57:38 <oerjan> :t elemIndex
11:57:40 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Maybe Int
11:57:48 <oerjan> _fang: also that one ^^
11:58:23 <dons> joelr1: i can't think of any reason why you wouldn't expect very good performance, given smp native threads, strict bytestrings, and ghc optimising the hell out of them.
11:58:29 <oerjan> byorgey: which is equivalent to :load, since hugs doesn't support loading more than one top module
11:58:36 <dons> joelr1: did you have something in particular that you thought would be an issue?
11:58:42 <byorgey> oerjan: oh, boo.
11:59:14 <_fang> perfect
11:59:21 <_fang> like a charm!
11:59:24 <_fang> thank you all!
11:59:26 <byorgey> huh, I never know about elemIndex =)
11:59:33 <byorgey> _fang: you're welcome =)
12:05:23 <_fang> err, one more question xD the return of the findIndex and elemIndex is "Just x" can i take the Just off??
12:05:47 <mauke> _fang: only if it's not Nothing
12:06:17 <fasta> Is the ST monad in some standard already? (I think not)
12:06:17 <byorgey> _fang: check out the functions in Data.Maybe.
12:06:23 <byorgey> @source Data.Maybe
12:06:24 <lambdabot> http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/base/Data/Maybe.hs
12:06:30 <byorgey> erm, no
12:06:41 <mauke> pfft, case elemIndex ... of Nothing -> ...; Just x -> ...
12:07:04 <oerjan> > case elemIndex 3 [1,3,5] of Just x -> x; Nothing -> 42
12:07:06 <lambdabot>  1
12:07:18 <oerjan> > case elemIndex 2 [1,3,5] of Just x -> x; Nothing -> 42
12:07:20 <lambdabot>  42
12:08:41 <_fang> great! thanks one more time =]
12:12:29 <fasta> Is there anyone here who is good in Haskell and Java?
12:12:59 <shapr> Do you have a question that concerns both of them?
12:13:01 <mrd> can you get them to admit they know java?
12:13:39 <fasta> Well, in ##java they just told me that Java doesn't give the programmer access to uninitialised memory.
12:13:44 <fasta> I don't really believe it.
12:13:49 <fasta> Even Haskell does that :)
12:14:04 <fasta> It could of course be that GHC >> Java RTS
12:14:11 <njbartlett> Hey, I'll admit to it. I'm forced to use Java at work.
12:14:14 <mrd> you could go gander at the spec
12:14:14 <fasta> But that would be a bit unlikely.
12:14:31 <fasta> mrd: yes, they told me to look into the spec.
12:14:59 <fasta> I guess, that's what I will do, but I figured it might be that someone was a walking encyclopedia was here.
12:15:19 <fasta> Modulo grammar ;)
12:15:32 <njbartlett> I don't really understand the question
12:15:43 <Philippa> fasta: it doesn't, other than via the JNI
12:16:07 <Philippa> there aren't any pointers per se in Java
12:16:25 <qwr> only null pointers...
12:16:28 <Philippa> even the NullPointerException is strictly speaking an abstraction error - it should be NullReferenceException
12:16:31 <fasta> You don't need pointers for uninitialised memory.
12:17:00 <Philippa> no, you don't. But you also have to initialise variables
12:17:07 <Philippa> you need one of the two
12:17:11 <ac> Is there a way to prevent deep nesting of lets and do blocks? My code goes 5 levels deep, and it seems ugly
12:17:29 <Philippa> ac: yeah, factor the code out
12:17:36 <mrd> do you need to nest them?
12:17:44 <mrd> do let x = 3; ... works
12:17:45 <fasta> ac: then either you do something horribly complicated or you do something wrong
12:17:56 <ac> I think so. The problem is my lets depend on results from do blocks, and the statements in do blocks depend on the outer lets, etc
12:18:06 <fasta> ac: paste code, other discussion is pointless.
12:18:06 <ac> fasta: I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong
12:18:06 <Philippa> doesn't matter
12:18:18 <geezusfreeek> fasta, java automatically initializes primitive values, which is probably what they meant
12:18:22 <Philippa> let inside do works differently
12:18:37 <swiert> How do you access unallocated memory in Haskell?
12:18:46 <Philippa> via the FFI
12:18:56 <fasta> swiert: unsafeNewArray_ (a function I requested)
12:19:08 <hpaste>  ac pasted "Nasty let and do nesting in main" at http://hpaste.org/3456
12:19:08 <fasta> swiert: that's a constant time operation.
12:19:14 <dons> that's allocated memory :)
12:19:18 <dons> just not initialised yet
12:19:39 <dons> unallocated memory is a little harder, but not much more so :)
12:19:44 <fasta> Oh, right, I misread swiert.
12:20:05 <swiert> fasta: All right.
12:20:18 <fasta> I don't see the point of unallocated memory.
12:20:27 <fasta> That seems dangerous for no reason.
12:20:29 <dons> what if you're writing a memory allocator?
12:20:47 <mrd> ac: you see, you don't need the 'in' part
12:20:56 <mrd> do let x = 3; ... works
12:21:11 <ac> mrd: oh. that would improve things
12:21:17 <ac> hehe
12:21:31 <fasta> dons: ok, good point, but I wonder what things you would use it for.
12:21:48 <byorgey> ac: can't you factor out the drawLine part into a separate function?
12:21:51 <dons> creating segfaults?
12:22:09 <ac> byorgey: yeah, it would have an IO type
12:22:13 <fasta> dons: e.g. the normal evaluation will still be garbage collected, so essentially you need to bypass GHC completely.
12:22:15 <ac> byorgey: I just haven't gotten around to that
12:22:20 <byorgey> ac: right.  that's ok.
12:22:23 <daniel_larsson> dons: C programmers would certainly feel at home
12:22:28 <ac> Speaking of that code, does anybody know how to use gtk2hs?
12:22:29 <fasta> dons: then you will just have another binary running in assembly.
12:23:00 <fasta> dons: but you use the extra memory of GHC, in which case it would be smarter not to use GHC at all.
12:24:00 <geezusfreeek> ac, implementing wolframs recently proven turing machine?
12:24:31 <ac> geezusfreeek: nah, I started this a few days ago. I'm going to graduate to continuous automata as soon as I get this satisfactorily coded
12:25:11 <swiert> dons: so how would you go about accessing unallocated memory?
12:25:13 <geezusfreeek> ah
12:25:30 <ac> I'd like to be able to draw smoothly scrolling pictures using gtk. Think side-scrolling game
12:25:40 <ac> What I have works, and is reasonably fast, but it flickers
12:25:56 <dons> swiert: create a pointer, and do some pointer arithmetic on it?
12:26:07 <dons> seems fairly dangerous
12:26:15 <Taejo> geezusfreeek, I implemented Wolfram and Smith's TM a few weeks ago: http://squing.blogspot.com/2007/08/on-open-problem-of-wolfram.html
12:26:17 <lambdabot> Title: The Most Fuun You Can Have: On an open problem of Wolfram, http://tinyurl.com/2xe997
12:26:39 <Taejo> I personally think it's an interesting implementation (quite compact, too)
12:27:25 <geezusfreeek> i had started to write one myself as well when i heard about it, but i had to abandon it
12:27:32 <gio126126> is here sombdoy mathematica programer?
12:28:24 <ac> also, I'm not set on using gtk. If there's another library that would do the trick, I'd be happy to use that
12:28:32 <swiert> dons: ok. Can do you reckon it can be done without using the FFI? I mean, just in the IO monad.
12:29:04 <gio126126> is here sombdoy mathematica programer?
12:29:15 <oerjan> gio126126: might try in #math
12:29:41 <geezusfreeek> swiert, it probably can be done via some exploit in some other bound library, but i think ideally it should be impossible to do that

12:47:24 <jodevR> hi
12:47:36 <jodevR> I am having some trouble with types
12:48:05 <jodevR> when i try to run fringe in the code i pasted
12:48:12 <jodevR> i get type errors
12:48:24 <mauke> fringe better written as fringe t = (: []) (++) t
12:48:30 <mauke> which doesn't make sense
12:48:40 <omnId> jodevR: did you forget the call to traverse in fringe?
12:49:07 <jodevR> omnId: i think that might be it
12:49:43 <omnId> as is, fringe t = [(++)] t
12:50:48 <jodevR> still does not work
12:50:56 <jodevR> even with traverse in fringe
12:51:13 <mauke> what's the error?
12:51:29 <jodevR> type error in application
12:51:42 <jodevR> Expression     : (\x -> x : []) (\x y -> x ++ y) t

12:54:05 <mauke> (\x y -> x + y) is (+)
12:55:14 <jodevR> mauke: thanks, i really need advice to become more haskelly
12:56:07 <mauke> you can ask @pl :-)
12:56:20 <mauke> @pl traverse (\x -> x) (\x y -> x + y) t
12:56:20 <lambdabot> traverse id (+) t
12:56:38 <mauke> @pl traverse (\x -> 0) (\x y -> 1 + max x y) t
12:56:39 <lambdabot> traverse (const 0) (((1 +) .) . max) t
12:56:53 <mauke> ok, so the second one probably wasn't a good idea
12:57:36 <Taejo> @type traverse
12:57:38 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `traverse'
12:57:43 <omnId> the third is: traverse (: []) (++) t, like mauke said earlier
12:58:11 <omnId> Taejo: in jodevR's paste
12:58:19 <Taejo> oh, ok
13:14:08 <Taejo> is anyone here not reading http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/TM23Proof.pdf ?
13:14:19 <dons> i refuse to :)
13:15:45 <Taejo> why?
13:16:49 <dons> wolfram's always coming up with new kinds of science
13:16:54 <dons> how many can there be ??
13:16:59 <vincenz> many
13:17:03 <vincenz> just take set theory
13:17:06 <vincenz> there's 10 axioms
13:17:08 <vincenz> so 2^10 possibilities
13:17:23 <Taejo> dons, I don't care much for Wolfram, but it's an interesting result nevertheless
13:20:18 <Taejo> you can tell you're an academic when... you find it difficult to read papers set in Word, and you know that that's why
13:20:49 <mrd> you don't need to be an academic for that, though maybe to know why =)
13:21:09 <Taejo> mrd, I meant that
13:21:40 <Taejo> everybody finds long Word documents hard to read, but only academics think why didn't this guy use TeX
13:25:15 <puusorsa> tex for teh win!
13:25:42 <Taejo> hehe, he uses Perl

14:32:10 <ac> vincenz: oh, not text, pixels
14:32:18 <vincenz> opengl
14:32:20 <vincenz> or gtk2hs
14:32:37 <ac> vincenz: I'm using gtk2hs and pixbufCopyArea, but that causes flickering
14:32:58 <joelr1> evening
14:34:20 <joelr1> dons: no, i don't have any particular concerns
14:34:39 <Philippa> ac: look for double buffering options?
14:34:41 <ac> vincenz: I don't want to switch to OpenGL unless I'm sure gtk can't do it
14:34:43 <bitrot> ac: why not try SDL?
14:35:05 <ac> bitrot: are there Haskell bindings? SDL definitely does what I want
14:35:07 <vincenz> ac: I'd only be able to recommend what Philippa said, that's as far as my knowledge goes, usually did vectorial stuff
14:35:13 <Zao> gtk2hs has one major issue for me. It doesn't like -threaded.
14:35:20 <joelr1> is anyone writing a javascript interpreter or compiler?
14:35:40 <vincenz> you mean the language with crappy scoping?
14:35:46 <bitrot> ac: haskell is mentioned on the front page of libsdl.org...
14:36:54 <Lemmih> Hm, we should update the link on libsdl.org.

14:37:03 <sorear> bitrot: wow
14:37:04 <vincenz> hi lambdabot
14:37:05 <vincenz> erm
14:37:06 <vincenz> Lemmih:
14:37:28 <Lemmih> Hi vincenz.
14:37:29 <joelr1> vincenz: yeah
14:37:36 <sorear> ac: you can do it with gdk, if you do it 'correctly'
14:37:44 <sorear> ac: there's no double buffering
14:38:00 <sorear> ac: so you have to arrange single-write uptdates yourself
14:38:36 <ac> sorear: does that mean I can't simply use onExpose?
14:38:41 <Philippa> sorear: I think we were talking about slightly different problems then. I'd be surprised if there's /no/ double-buffering
14:38:56 <Philippa> as opposed to no access to manual flipping
14:39:15 <joelr1> @tell bringert thanks a lot!
14:39:16 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
14:41:01 <ac> sorear: perhaps the function registered for onExpose isn't being called when I want it to, and is updating small regions at a time
14:43:43 <vincenz> ac: onexpose is only called when you refresh the window
14:43:47 <vincenz> aka when you move it or display it
14:43:54 <vincenz> ac: you have to call it manually to force it to recompute
14:44:09 <shapr> @quote
14:44:09 <lambdabot> MyCatVerbs says: [talking about #haskell] seriously, it's like the entire planet got mutant powers and many all the people here just happened to get Psychic MegaHelpFulness.
14:44:33 <vincenz> ac: use widgetQueueDraw for that
14:47:52 <ac> vincenz: I am using widgetQueueDraw, and I think that might be my problem. I'm experimenting with removing it right now
14:49:47 <vincenz> ac: let me know how it goes
14:50:14 <ac> vincenz: I'm having to rewrite my updateCanvas function so it doesn't take an event... Do you know what a GC is?
14:50:30 <vincenz> graphics context?
14:50:38 <ac> make sense
14:50:39 <Lemmih> garbage collector?
14:51:15 <Lemmih> Hm, guess not.
14:51:15 <ac> Lemmih: (in the context of gtk :)
14:55:18 * shapr hugs Lemmih 
14:57:01 <ac> is the only way to pass -1 to a function is to write (-1)?
14:57:58 <Lemmih> ac: There's also (negate 1).
14:58:48 <omnId> f -1 subtracts 1 from f.
15:00:45 <ac> vincenz: no luck. drawPixbuf by itself does not draw in one operation
15:03:51 <Lemmih> Haskellers seems less affectionate irl.
15:04:05 * Lemmih demands a hug at the next hackathon.
15:04:14 <puusorsa> <3
15:04:44 <shapr> Lemmih: I would have hugged you at AngloHaskell but I know that scandinavians find that invasive sometimes!
15:05:06 <vincenz> ac: no bitblt?
15:05:43 <wli> In some places/cultures kisses on the cheek are standard.
15:06:04 <gkr> shapr awww ^.^

15:06:49 <dons> :)
15:07:02 <ac> vincenz: not in gtk, that I know of
15:07:12 <ac> vincenz: perhaps drawPixbuf is not the appropriate function
15:09:00 <vincenz> ac: :|
15:11:52 <nominolo> @tell swiert any idea how i can embed "||" into a latex doc with the tmr class?  i get weird errors and can't find a way around them.
15:11:52 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
15:14:36 <nominolo> shapr, Lemmih is southern scandinavia ;)
15:15:03 <shapr> nominolo: Yeah, but Denmark isn't exactly France.
15:15:22 <nominolo> or not.  Lemmih, why does your IP resolve to .se ?
15:16:15 <waern> He lives in sweden
15:16:50 <nominolo> jaha
15:17:04 <waern> the place to be...
15:22:15 <Taejo> my friend is teaching basic algorithmic stuff to high-schoolers and is looking for some simple examples of exponential-time algorithms
15:22:36 <glguy> how about sorting by testing all permutations of the set of elements
15:23:12 <nominolo> exhaustive search?
15:24:02 <ac> quicksilver: you around?
15:24:07 <nominolo> most optimization problems.  graph coloring ...
15:24:26 <Taejo> nominolo, these guys don't know graph theory
15:24:36 <Taejo> glguy, isn't that factorial time?
15:24:46 <wli> 0-1 integer linear equations.
15:24:58 <glguy> Taejo: factorial time is exponential time
15:25:10 <Taejo> factorial is superexponential
15:25:31 <Taejo> O(n!) is not a subset of O(k^n) for all n
15:25:37 <Taejo> I mean for all k
15:25:41 <wli> Omega(n/e)^n
15:26:51 <Taejo> wli, indeed, but the base (n/e) grows linearly
15:27:42 <shapr> Whoa, I got a live one! Exception when trying to run compile-time code: \n Unexpected type: AppT (ConT GHC.IOBase.IO) (VarT res_1627589863)
15:27:49 <wli> Omega(n/e)^n is intended to emphasize superexponentiality.
15:29:30 <nominolo> shapr, template haskell?
15:29:56 <shapr> nominolo: yup
15:30:50 <nominolo> seems like a complicated way to "'IO res' did not match ..."  :)
15:39:41 <sjanssen> @seen dcoutts
15:39:41 <lambdabot> dcoutts is in #gentoo-haskell, #haskell-overflow, #haskell, #ghc and #darcs. I last heard dcoutts speak 3h 47m 20s ago.
15:48:40 <bos> ac: is your code still heavily nested like that snippet you posted a few hours ago?
15:49:10 <dcoutts> hia sjanssen
15:49:57 <sjanssen> dcoutts: Cabal question, is it possible to get the path to ghc as a constant at build time?
15:50:29 <dcoutts> sjanssen: if you do it yourself, yes
15:50:30 <sorear> dcoutts: ac is having gtk2hs problems
15:50:51 <sorear> dcoutts: won't that break with --ghc=xyz?
15:51:11 <dcoutts> sjanssen: but bear in mind that the ghc you build with on one machine is not necessarily the same one available when your program gets run on a different machine
15:51:32 <dcoutts> sorear: it would be possible to take that into account
15:51:40 <sjanssen> dcoutts: hmm, good point.  We'll probably just use whichever ghc is in $PATH
15:52:12 <dcoutts> sjanssen: you'd have to do some ugly hacks in Setup.hs, I would not recommend it. Yeah, just use the $PATH and let the user override it
15:52:43 <dons> right
15:55:42 <ac> bos: no
15:55:59 <bos> ok, it was all unnecessary
15:56:18 <ac> bos: mrd pointed out that you can leave out the "in" in lets
15:56:24 <bos> right
15:58:59 <ac> is there a website somewhere that allows grepping #haskell logs?
16:00:05 <bos> not grepping, afaik
16:00:15 <bos> though you can download and grep them yourself
16:00:20 <sjanssen> ac: you can mirror them locally
16:00:40 <ddarius> You can just google them.
16:01:07 <sieni> does google support regular expressions?
16:01:21 <EvilTerran> no, but it does some approximation of globbing

16:01:41 <pjd> i think you have to login to search, though
16:01:45 <EvilTerran> hm. never mind.
16:02:06 <pjd> EvilTerran: it handles things like "best * ever"
16:02:42 <EvilTerran> i knew * does something like what it does in globs
16:03:13 <EvilTerran> but i'm really not sure if google's query interpretation is even deterministic. there may be some weird learning machine working behind the scenes
16:05:23 <hpaste>  sjanssen pasted "a handy log fetching script from sorear" at http://hpaste.org/3461
16:05:43 <ac> EvilTerran: I don't think they do anything too fancy, but I just attended a talk by one of Google's search quality guys who explained they have a giant bayesian net that disambiguates phrases and infers related words
16:05:46 <sjanssen> ac: you may be interested in that script ^^^
16:06:13 <ac> EvilTerran: and the bayesian net is of course generated from content on the web
16:06:40 <EvilTerran> so it will shift around a bit
16:06:51 <gio126126> <ac> i think they use matching
16:07:22 <gio126126> <ac> matching with regular expresion

16:10:28 <alexj> anyone here have experience with Play vs SYB?
16:11:00 <sorear> @seen ndm
16:11:01 <lambdabot> I saw ndm leaving #haskell-soc, #ghc, #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell 1h 42m 18s ago, and .
16:11:11 <sorear> just missed the authority
16:11:35 <alexj> he would be the authority on Play.   looking for some practical experience with both...
16:12:02 <alexj> HAppS currently uses SYB.  Just read a presentation from him on Play.  Looks interesting.  don't know if switching is worthwhile.
16:12:16 <alexj> I guess I can ask him tomorrow.
16:12:27 <alexj> but looking for other experience and advice as well.
16:13:01 <bparkis> hey i was thinking, what if you had a language where if a function has multiple arguments of the same type, they all commute?
16:13:21 <bparkis> that way you could write the arguments to the function in any order with no ambiguity
16:14:04 <pjd> bparkis: you would need a way of knowing that they actually commute
16:14:06 <bparkis> you might not be able to write a division function, but you could write a 'multiplicative inverse' function and a 'product' function and use them together (no way to abstract them though)
16:14:53 <omnId> so, rule out noncommutative functions?  Seems a hefty restriction.
16:14:59 <ac> sjanssen: thanks for the script
16:15:10 <bparkis> or you could write a function that took a data structure with a divisor and a dividend field, and pass that instead of the arguments as integers
16:15:24 <bparkis> or numbers, whatever
16:15:59 <omnId> the function to make that data structure wouldn't commute.
16:16:40 <omnId> > 3%2 == 2%3
16:16:42 <lambdabot>  False
16:17:24 <bparkis> well, you could write a function that took an integer and a 'modulo'
16:17:51 <bparkis> and first construct a 'modulo' from 3, then pass 2 and the 'modulo 3' structure to the mod function
16:18:20 <bparkis> so mod (modulo 3) 2 = mod 2 (modulo 3) = 2
16:18:39 <omnId> sounds like using recip and (*) for division.
16:18:46 <Beelsebob> bah
16:18:48 <bparkis> yes you'd have to do that
16:18:51 <Beelsebob> introductions are hard to write
16:19:01 <bparkis> or else you could say divide (divisor 4) (dividend 5)
16:19:14 <EvilTerran> named parameters!
16:19:16 <bparkis> which would be the same as divide (dividend 5) (divisor 4)
16:19:20 <EvilTerran> record systems!
16:19:32 <omnId> divisor, dividend :: Integer -> DivideParam,
16:19:36 <bparkis> not named parameters exactly though, because dividend and divisor would be data constructors
16:19:52 <EvilTerran> same end result
16:19:55 <bparkis> wrapping up the integer into a type so that it can be distinguished
16:20:01 <bparkis> but yeah same result
16:20:06 <omnId> I don't see much difference from named params, either.
16:20:33 <omnId> what does (divide (dividend 5) (dividend 4)) do?  runtime error?
16:20:36 <EvilTerran> you can pass a parameter-and-name around as a value independently from the function with this system, i guess
16:20:42 <bparkis> well, the reason i think it might be worth a little consideration is that it would prevent you from encoding 'type information' in the ordering of the fields
16:20:50 <bparkis> omnId: compile time error because the type swouldn't match
16:21:04 <EvilTerran> you'd need permuatation types or something O.o
16:21:28 <bparkis> because when you say a / b you are really kind of implying that b is a 'denominator' and a is a 'numerator' which is sort of like an unspoken pair of types
16:22:33 <ddarius> What you just said makes almost no sense.
16:22:53 <omnId> hm?
16:23:09 <bparkis> well, i don't have much time to talk (sorry) and maybe it doesn't make that much sense
16:23:14 <bparkis> i'll come back later
16:24:33 <n00b> @vixen I
16:24:33 <lambdabot> you know what? if we'd known it was going to be like this we'd have picked our own goddamn cotton!

16:34:16 <dons> hmm, good question.
16:34:16 <omnId> is ?vixen-on channel-sensitive?
16:34:17 <ddarius> She is presumably annoying all the ones with people talking.  For example, #math.
16:34:22 <dons> omnId: i'm not sure...
16:34:29 <dons> ddarius: ah cool :)
16:34:38 <dons> well, presumably no longer annoying them?
16:35:10 <vincenz> dons: how does your gf feel about having to share you with lambdabot ?
16:35:20 <dons> she doesn't really.
16:35:29 <dons> lambdabot's definitely on the outer
16:35:36 * vincenz comforts lambdabot 
16:35:51 <omnId> so she doesn't know of your relationship with LB?  For shame, dons!

17:09:54 <Rasser_> I have a big list of numbers, is it possible to keep an array counting how many times i have seen each number ? I have never used Array
17:11:50 <dcoutts> Rasser_: you can only use an array if you know in advance the range of the numbers
17:12:01 <dcoutts> Rasser_: otherwise you will not know how big an array to use
17:12:13 <Rasser_> i know the range
17:12:24 <dcoutts> then look at accumArray
17:12:27 <dcoutts> @type accumArray
17:12:29 <lambdabot> forall e a i. (Ix i) => (e -> a -> e) -> e -> (i, i) -> [(i, a)] -> Array i e

17:30:15 <newsham> zipper flipper
17:43:04 <joelr1> augustss: hi lennart!
17:43:12 <augustss> Hi Joel
17:43:30 <joelr1> augustss: tell me, how do you manage, being in london, to be up a this late an hour?
17:43:41 <dmwit> ?localtime augustss
17:43:42 <lambdabot> Local time for augustss is 2007-10-25 01:43:28 +0100
17:43:45 <augustss> Usually I'm not
17:43:52 <joelr1> :-)
17:43:54 <dmwit> pfft, that's early
17:43:55 <augustss> I'm still a bit jet lagged
17:43:56 <dmwit> ;-)
17:44:01 <joelr1> ?localtime joelr1
17:44:02 <lambdabot> Local time for joelr1 is 2007-10-25 01:43:55 +0100
17:44:12 <dmwit> hahaha
17:44:29 <joelr1> dmwit: what's so funny?
17:45:29 <joelr1> augustss: i'm picking up haskell again
17:45:45 <augustss> Cool.  It's improving
17:45:47 <joelr1> hopefully, this time performance won't be an issue
17:46:23 <augustss> Time performance is getting better.  And it's usually not that bad.
17:46:29 <joelr1> i want to write 1) a javascript to erlang compiler and 2) a natural language processing system, a lambdabot that understands what i tell it and does stuff for me
17:46:54 <augustss> Javascript to Erlang, huh?
17:47:05 <augustss> sounds backwards ;)
17:47:31 <augustss> everyone else is targetting javascript
17:47:31 <joelr1> augustss: yeah, actionscript actually. think massively scalable javascript on the backend. all the flash people won't have to learn a single line of erlang
17:47:53 <joelr1> i'm targeting it (actionscript) as well... sort of. i have it in my sights
17:48:18 <joelr1> in both cases performance is not key
17:48:43 <augustss> well, compilers are good to write in Haskell, imo
17:48:51 <joelr1> i mean, not as important as in the stuff i was trying to do before
17:49:38 <joelr1> yes, i tried writing one but liked the ocaml code better. haskell seems to be far ahead of ocaml as far as nlp goes and laziness actually helps. plus, parser combinators suck in ocaml.
17:49:48 <newsham> why do you want to turn javascript into erlang?
17:50:12 <joelr1> newsham: easy. so that flash people can deploy scalable backends without having to learn erlang.
17:50:37 <newsham> people are writing javascript for the server side?
17:50:39 <joelr1> there's a chasm right now where people write the front-end in actionscript (flash) and then have to do the backend in something else entirely
17:50:48 <newsham> eek
17:51:18 <joelr1> these people would love to write their backend in actionscript as well, at least that's what i'm betting on'
17:51:38 <joelr1> augustss: any major advancements on your trading end?
17:51:55 <augustss> no, it's slow progress
17:52:15 <augustss> some more investment banks here and there using Haskell though
17:53:02 <joelr1> augustss: in the same mode and direction?
17:53:19 <joelr1> i.e. modeling of financial instruments
17:53:38 <augustss> Yes, that much is the same, I think
17:53:39 <joelr1> i'm wondering if anyone is using haskell on the frontlines so to speak, apart from galois
17:53:53 <Excedrin> joelr1: are you aware of haXe?
17:54:00 <joelr1> Excedrin: yes, of course
17:54:11 <joelr1> haxe != actionscript
17:54:19 <Excedrin> it sounds similar to what you're talking about
17:54:41 <newsham> it would be awesome having a thread-less event driven scripting language for back end programming!
17:54:44 <joelr1> augustss: deploying models in c++ doesn't seem frontline to me
17:54:56 <joelr1> newsham: what do you have in mind?
17:55:02 <joelr1> Excedrin: yes, it's very similar
17:55:19 <newsham> joelr: I dont much care for javascript.  That I have to use it sometimes on the client side is bad enough
17:55:47 <augustss> joelr1: I'm not sure what you count as frontline, ABN-Amro are doing some counterparty risk stuff in Haskell
17:56:08 <joelr1> newsham: i see
17:57:01 <newsham> it would be a lot better if there were threads (but still not great)
17:57:09 <joelr1> augustss: that's frontline. i thought you guys were deploying in c++. then again, it's a step-by-step process and wall st. is very conservative
17:57:23 * joelr1 misses his wall st. years
17:57:42 <augustss> We're using Haskell to generate Excel that uses C++
17:58:01 <joelr1> augustss: right. and duly noted.
17:59:03 <augustss> which does mean that haskell is not on the front line.  which means it's an easier sell
18:00:15 <Jiten> so you're using haskell as a sort of metalanguage.
18:00:19 <idnar> if you want to write code that runs server-side as well as client-side
18:00:20 <joelr1> augustss: i think two or three banks using haskell is a huge step forward
18:00:29 <jeffz> s
18:00:34 <joelr1> Jiten: are you asking me?
18:00:42 <joelr1> probably augustss
18:00:57 <idnar> you either need to have some third language you compile to both python/ruby/haskell/whatever-the-server-uses, and javascript; or compile $SERVERLANG to javascript; or compile javascript to $SERVERLANG
18:01:00 <Jiten> not really asking :)
18:01:01 <augustss> Credit Suisse, Barcley Capital, Deutsche Bank, Lehmann Brothers
18:01:21 <idnar> given the poor performance of the JS implementation in most browsers, it might be best from that perspective to go from JS to $SERVERLANG
18:01:42 <joelr1> augustss: looks like an avalanche to me. do you know what barcleys, deutsche and lehman are using it for?
18:01:42 <augustss> Jiten: yes, it's like a metalanguage
18:02:29 <joelr1> come to think about it...
18:02:56 <augustss> barcap is using it for a payout language, deutsche is doing web related data processing, lehmann is using it to program FPGAs and for some new exotics stuff in Hong Kong
18:03:22 <joelr1> augustss: i worked in securities lending and then prime brokerage (on the tech side of course). we did deal with structured finance a lot, though. i think a lot of things could have made use of haskell then
18:03:36 <joelr1> then = back in '97-98
18:06:58 <joelr1> it's time for me to go to sleep. today will be another day and i'll connect my mbp to my cinema display. and tomorrow leopard comes out.
18:07:21 <joelr1> time to start a new life, i guess, one that once again includes haskell
18:08:57 <joelr1> where are those mailing lists...
18:10:01 <joelr1> good night everyone!

18:20:47 <lambdabot> No matches found
18:20:48 <LoganCapaldo> (by hoogle I mean the hoogle website)
18:21:43 <ddarius> It's done it for quite a while at least.
18:22:51 <sorear> LoganCapaldo: hoogle is hoogle
18:23:23 <LoganCapaldo> I know it's jsut hitting the website, but it;s doing some post processing obviously or else html would be spewed into the channel ;)
18:23:42 <sorear> LoganCapaldo: no, it doesn't hit the website
18:23:52 <LoganCapaldo> Oh?
18:24:08 <LoganCapaldo> shows what I know
18:24:26 <sorear> hoogle is a standalone program
18:24:38 <sorear> there's a cgi interface, and a laambdabot interface
18:24:46 <LoganCapaldo>  this is the only channel where I am so wrong on sucha consistent basis
18:25:08 <ddarius> So the trick is to believe whatever you think is wrong.
18:25:37 <SamB_XP> ddarius: since when is that a trick?
18:26:07 <SamB_XP> oh, wait, I misparsed that
18:30:13 <LoganCapaldo> but sometimes I'm right
18:30:41 <LoganCapaldo> Although I guess the ratio would improve
18:33:08 <SamB_XP> only on true/false questions
18:35:28 <LoganCapaldo> see I'm even wrong about how wrong I would be I inverted my beliefes :)
18:35:49 <SamB_XP> well no
18:36:02 <SamB_XP> but the trouble is you can't invert most of them ;-)
18:36:15 <LoganCapaldo> heh

19:03:40 <ac> could common libraries be added to hoogle?
19:04:36 <shapr> Would be nice, I agree.
19:04:54 <ac> what sort of format does hoogle eat?
19:05:57 <allbery_b> IIRC haddock can generate hoogle indexes
19:06:33 <bparkis> so earlier this evening i was suggesting the idea of a language where arguments must commute
19:06:47 <bparkis> i had to leave to take a test but i'm back now
19:08:01 <bparkis> that is, arguments must commute to the same type
19:08:29 <bparkis> so if a function takes three arguments: two ints and a string, the ints have to commute with each other but the string does not
19:08:36 <ac> allbery_b: so why aren't there more libraries in its indexes, like OpenGL
19:09:02 <bparkis> to recap:  the question arose, how do you do divison?  and 2 answers were found:  multiply a (reciprocal b) and divide (dividend a) (divisor b) where dividend and divisor are data constructors
19:10:09 <ac> bparkis: what's the advantage?
19:10:33 <bparkis> i left having just made a vague comment about how 'a / b' puts an implicit type on a and b, as a dividend and divisor, respectively, and the commutative language would just require that to be explicit
19:10:42 <sorear> ac: ndm's lazines
19:10:49 <bparkis> i was challenged on the grounds that that argument didn't make much sense so now i'm going to try to explain what i meant
19:13:40 <ac> sorear: blarg, I want to search for something in OpenGL
19:13:40 <bparkis> it was an offhand comment, but I think I basically was driving at the idea that, speaking generally, a type is some kind of information about the interpretation of a piece of data in your program
19:14:38 <sorear> bparkis: "Types describe data" is already taken as Conor McBride's catchphrase
19:14:41 <bparkis> so if you write a / b, b is interpreted differently from a, so in some way you could call that interpretation "type" information attached to b
19:15:23 <bparkis> you still may not buy it, but i think that's at least clearer
19:17:08 <bparkis> so i'd say there's 2 possible reasons to think about a commutative programming language:  1., it makes that positional "type information" explicit as data constructors instead of implicit in the position of the arguments
19:17:42 <bparkis> and 2., it may serve as a memory aid
19:17:58 <bparkis> suppose you have a function that takes six integers, all of which are used differently and must be interpreted in a specific order
19:18:27 <bparkis> whenever you used that function, until you got used to it, you'd have to constantly refer back to its documentation to remember what goes where
19:18:46 <allbery_b> ac: no idea, I don't run any of the public hoogle interfaces
19:19:13 <ncowham> bparkis, but named parameters would really provide that sort of advantage
19:19:19 <bparkis> disallowing that and requiring the intent of arguments to be encoded instead explicitly as types may clarify the function's use
19:19:31 <bparkis> yeah ncowham it basically is named parameters, with a slight difference
19:19:47 <bparkis> say you have a function that takes a string, a list, an integer, and a tree in that order
19:20:29 <bparkis> in a commutative programming language, you wouldn't have to care about the order you put them in
19:20:43 <bparkis> and you wouldn't have to name them with "named parameters" either
19:20:53 <bparkis> you could just enter them in any order and that would be valid
19:21:01 <ncowham> but I would have to keep track of the parameter type
19:21:14 <bparkis> you always have to keep track of types
19:21:42 <ncowham> yes but adding additional type information makes that even more burdonsome for me
19:21:58 <ncowham> using named parameters makes it more transparent
19:22:11 <bparkis> but you don't have to add additional type information if the parameters are all different
19:22:24 <bparkis> are all of different types
19:23:28 <bparkis> say in a standard PL you have foo S I L T  where S is a string, I is an integer, L is a list, T is a tree
19:23:36 <ncowham> perhaps if you could suggest a real world problem it might make easier to solve
19:23:49 <ncowham> im having a hard time grasping the advantage
19:24:07 <bparkis> in a commutative PL you would not have to add any extra adornment, but you could enter it as foo T L I S or foo L T I S or any permutation thereof
19:24:32 <bparkis> well, at this stage it's just an idea, i don't think it's fair to ask for a real world application so soon
19:25:16 <ncowham> im not riding on you, just trying to grasp the advantage, gather a bit more context, you know?
19:25:52 <bparkis> but here's something i was considering, maybe just coincidental:  referential transparency allows the compiler to evaluate your expressions in any order, and a commutative PL would allow the programmer to enter them in any order
19:26:08 <bparkis> i don't know if that means anything but it struck me on the ride home
19:27:37 <ncowham> interesting - worth looking into
19:28:03 <ncowham> particularly if there is some attention paid to 'programmer ergonomics'
19:28:16 <Philippa> bparkis: in practice you'd have to adorn a significant class of functions
19:28:28 <Philippa> as there'd be a whole pile of types that only exist to say "yes, I did intend this"
19:28:47 <ncowham> seems that it would add additional 'housekeeping' somewhere along the development chain
19:29:46 <bparkis> it would be extra housekeeping, but it might also make your code more readable to someone else because the types would be explicit
19:31:23 <bparkis> i mean there's 2 sides, on the one hand you have to adorn your code with extra stuff, on the other hand there's no question about which argument to a function is being used for what
19:31:31 <Philippa> it's probably simpler just to add a new variety of application to the grammar - if it were cribbed off Smalltalk then it might be function :description parm, with "description" being an identifier. If you're feeling particularly picky you can put them in the type system too
19:32:00 <ddarius> description: parm  that would be more CLy.
19:32:03 <Philippa> yeah, but frankly? An IDE or a text editor or a prettyprinter can do that
19:32:57 <Philippa> I'd far rather we got on and wrote a text editor that'll display annotations to a buffer sensibly
19:35:11 <bparkis> there's another idea i talked about here a while ago, which was something about "implicit arguments" to functions, which is a bit related to a commutative PL
19:35:56 <bparkis> the idea was based on how in SAS (a statistical package) you choose your data set for a procedure and then everything in the procedure implicitly refers to that data set, without you having to state it again each time
19:36:43 <jaredj> Philippa: i'm leery of any attempt to program in rich text
19:37:04 <bparkis> so suppose that you have a list of statements (in a monad maybe) that drop their return value into a stack, sorted by type
19:37:18 <dataangel> Is it considered better style to match against [x] or against (x:[]) ?
19:37:40 <sjanssen> [x]
19:37:47 <bparkis> so if a statement returns an int, it drops its return value onto the int stack, and if a statement returns a char, it drops its return value onto a char stack, and if a statement returns a data set, it drops its return value onto a data set stack
19:38:17 <dataangel> Is there some nifty ghci functionality like using @src with lambdabot?
19:38:23 <bparkis> and then subsequent statements that demand arguments of a certain type, merely look at the top element from the appropriate stack and use that
19:38:36 <bparkis> (no popping, just peeking)
19:39:26 <bparkis> so i might say foo 5 which returns the string "five" and then i might say bar which returns the length of the string "five" namely 4
19:40:29 <bparkis> where commutativity could come in is that the order of the arguments in this scheme only depend on their types
19:40:48 <omnId> dataangel: you can get type, location, and fixity with :info, but no, no @src.
19:40:54 <bparkis> and if you have a function that wants to grab 2 "ints" from the int stack, it is either ambiguous or somewhat arbitrary which order to grab them in
19:41:17 <bparkis> so if the PL here is also commutative, the ambiguity is removed
19:42:59 <Philippa> jaredj: the whole point is that you wouldn't. You'd be programming ordinary code, only with additional text (highlighted appropriately) added to the buffer before display
19:43:15 <Philippa> for example, you might see the result of running the layout rule on your code
19:43:31 <Philippa> or generated type annotations for things that've been typechecked
19:43:54 <Philippa> but they wouldn't be there if you saved the file - they'd be generated again when you loaded it
19:46:25 <vagif> Hello. question. How to install Cabal 1.2.1 on ghc 6.6.1 ?
19:46:44 <vagif> setup configure says Unknown field 'flag small_base
19:47:09 <vagif>  Unknown field 'library
19:47:09 <vagif> if flag(small_base)
19:47:09 <vagif> build-depends'
19:47:41 <omnId> Philippa: reminds me of a project (whose name I just can't recall) that had you putting definitions in a simplified Haskell-like language into a floating "document".  These definitions could have display data associated with them and update interactively.
19:47:49 <sorear> looks like an attempt to build cabal 1.2 with cabal 1.1
19:48:02 <Philippa> omnId: vital/pivotal?
19:48:03 <vagif> should i first install other version of cabal ?
19:48:05 <sorear> you need cabal 1.2 or no cabal at all (i.e. the makefile)
19:48:11 <omnId> Philippa: yes.
19:48:13 <vagif> i see
19:48:20 <sjanssen> vagif: I think you're supposed to use 'make' instead of the usual Cabal procedure
19:48:20 <vagif> how do i install with make file ?
19:48:28 <sjanssen> bah, sorear is too fast
19:48:33 <sorear> not sure, but dcoutts is awake
19:48:52 <vagif> what is the synthax for make command to install Cabal ?
19:49:34 <vagif> there's file mkGHCMakefile.sh What shall i do with it ?
19:50:42 <sjanssen> vagif: do the instructions in README work?
19:51:00 <Philippa> talking of which, I had trouble getting a useful yi build under windows :-(
19:51:00 <vagif> there's no README
19:52:28 <sjanssen> oops, look like they forgot the README in the tarball
19:53:11 <sjanssen> vagif: http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/Cabal/README
19:53:20 <vagif> THX!
19:54:10 <sjanssen> @tell dcoutts http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/Cabal/1.2.1/Cabal-1.2.1.tar.gz is missing the README
19:54:10 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
19:55:09 <vagif> ok tried make install. Gives following error:
19:55:22 <vagif> make: *** No rule to make target `install'.  Stop.
19:55:41 <vagif> is anything else missing ?
19:55:51 <vagif> some make config file ?
19:56:22 <sjanssen> vagif: try the part that starts with "ghc -i. --make Setup.lhs -o setup"
19:56:40 <vagif> that part relies on Cabal, i already tried that
19:56:50 <vagif> I think Makefile is missing.
19:56:55 <vagif> I'm going to download it
20:03:58 <chessguy> @go 2 kilometers in miles
20:04:00 <lambdabot> 2 kilometers = 1.24274238 miles
20:04:52 <omnId> @go 5 mi in km
20:04:53 <lambdabot> 5 mi = 8.04672 kilometers
20:04:57 <omnId> ^ approximate equality
20:05:54 <ddarius> @google 5 kilometers in miles
20:05:56 <lambdabot> 5 kilometers = 3.10685596 miles
20:09:04 <sjanssen> vagif: ghc --make Setup; ./Setup configure; ./Setup build works perfectly for me.  Have you tried that exactly?
20:09:39 <vagif> yes, it gives error. But i downloaded missing Makefile, and looks like it works. It is compiling now
20:09:54 <sjanssen> that's weird
20:11:19 <vagif> actually it is weird that it works for you. Cabal file format changed since 1.1. So you should have seen error. If it works for you, it means you already have Cabal 1.2 installed
20:12:08 <sjanssen> no, ghc --make Setup will use the Cabal source from the tarball
20:12:14 <sjanssen> what did you run that didn't work?
20:12:39 <vagif> ghc --make Setup.lhs -o setup
20:12:42 <sjanssen> oh, they also recommend -i., I wonder if that makes a difference?
20:12:49 <vagif> ./setup configure
20:13:06 <vagif> gives warning about not understanding some keywords from Cabal file
20:13:15 <vagif> and then ./setup build gives error
20:20:29 <nburlett> hello!
20:20:43 <nburlett> someone said I could get text-any from darcs somewhere
20:20:48 <nburlett> anyone know where that is?
20:25:15 <sorear> nburlett: there is no such package as text-any
20:25:21 <nburlett> Setup.lhs: cannot satisfy dependency text-any
20:25:25 <nburlett> :<
20:25:30 <sorear> nburlett: 'any' is the version number
20:25:36 <nburlett> ahh
20:25:37 <sorear> you need any version of 'text'
20:25:46 * nburlett is enlightened
20:25:54 <sorear> @seen dcoutts
20:25:54 <lambdabot> dcoutts is in #gentoo-haskell, #haskell-overflow, #haskell and #ghc. I last heard dcoutts speak 2h 38m 48s ago.
20:25:56 * nburlett also feels stupid now
20:26:15 <sorear> you're at least the fourth person to ask about it on #haskell
20:26:32 <nburlett> heh
20:26:44 <nburlett> I asked a couple of days ago, but the server was down
20:27:03 <nburlett> perhaps cabal should say "could not satisfy dependency "text" version "any"
20:27:45 <sorear> 20:20 < nburlett> someone said I could get text-any from darcs somewhere / 20:25 < nburlett> Setup.lhs: cannot satisfy dependency text-any     This is a recurrent problem.  Should the error message be made more verbose, like 'dependancy text (any version)', 'dependancy text (version >= 2.2)'  ?
20:27:51 <sorear> er
20:27:55 <sorear> @ask dcoutts 20:20 < nburlett> someone said I could get text-any from darcs somewhere / 20:25 < nburlett> Setup.lhs: cannot satisfy dependency text-any     This is a recurrent problem.  Should the error message be made more verbose, like 'dependancy text (any version)', 'dependancy text (version >= 2.2)'  ?
20:27:55 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
20:29:11 <nburlett> so, where do I get the text package? :->
21:10:41 <ac> hah. in vim, the % command gets confused and ignores parenthesis prepended with \, so a Haskell lambda matching a tupple like "\(x,y) -> ..." confuses it
21:11:00 <sorear> yeah :/
21:11:04 <nburlett> gah, stupid internet
21:12:28 <kunal> hello. i am a newbie trying to learn haskell using the 48 hours tutorial. unfortunately i can't get the first hello arguments program to compile using ghc.
21:12:51 <nburlett> so, does anyone know where I can get the text package?
21:12:53 <kunal> i have tried tabs vs spaces
21:12:59 <ac> quicksilver: you around yet?
21:13:00 <dons> kunal: what error do you get/
21:13:02 <kunal> any idea
21:13:17 <dons> and what does your program look like?
21:13:18 <kunal> The last statement in a 'do' construct must be an expression
21:13:27 <dons> ok, so you have the formatting wrong somehow.
21:13:30 <dons> ?paste it
21:13:30 <lambdabot> Haskell pastebin: http://hpaste.org/new
21:13:33 <kunal> http://halogen.note.amherst.edu/~jdtang/scheme_in_48/tutorial/firststeps.html
21:13:34 <sorear> kunal: can you cat the file and try to compile it, and put a transwript on hpaste?
21:13:35 <lambdabot> Title: Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 hours, http://tinyurl.com/uto4h
21:13:37 <sorear> @paste
21:13:37 <lambdabot> Haskell pastebin: http://hpaste.org/new
21:14:46 <hpaste>  kunal pasted "(no title)" at http://hpaste.org/3463
21:16:14 <dons> so args and putStrLn need to  line up
21:16:17 <ac> is there a way to make C arrays in Haskell?
21:16:21 <dons> they should be idented the same amount
21:16:26 <dons> ac, yes.
21:16:50 <kunal> thanks dons
21:16:51 <dons> so you want strict, mutable arrays, or strict mutable arrays that can be passed to C functions?
21:16:54 <ac> specifically, the PixelData type in OpenGL is apparently just a 3D array of GLubytes, but I can't figure out how to construct one using Haskell
21:17:25 <dons> possibly with Foreign.Marshal.Array and other Foreign.* modules
21:17:58 <ac> kunal: if you don't like the whitespace rules, you can uses brackets and semicolons instead
21:18:35 <ac> kunal: personally I like the whitespace sensitivity, even though it's bit me a couple times. Just make sure everything in a block is aligned, and make sure there are no tabs in your file
21:19:09 <dons> :t do { x <- getChar ; putChar (toupper x) ; } -- scary stuff :)
21:19:12 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `toupper'
21:19:46 <ac> dons: would it be reasonable to use those, or am I just not finding the methods for the PixelData type in HOpenGL?
21:22:26 <dons> i'd suspect the methods either are there and you missed them, or they're not bound yet
21:22:50 <ac> dons: how does one find such things without hoogle?
21:23:25 <dons> oh, reading the haddocks for that library
21:23:40 <dons> people love that hoogle, eh?
21:24:28 <ac> it sure is useful
21:24:30 <bos> @hoogle (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]
21:24:30 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
21:24:38 <bos> 1
21:24:45 <bos> @djinn (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]
21:24:45 <lambdabot> f _ _ a = a
21:24:49 <bos> heh
21:24:58 * ddarius rarely ever uses Hoogle.  Maybe Hoogle 4 will be better.
21:25:37 <Zao> ac: http://zao.se/~zao/Hastris/Texture.hs
21:25:42 <Zao> That may or may not be useful.
21:25:49 <dons> hah
21:25:53 <dons> djinn++
21:26:06 <dons> its good for beginners to the language, i suspect
21:26:16 <dons> those who just poke around looking for things
21:27:50 <Zao> I think I just got by with mallocBytes and pokeByteOff
21:28:08 <ac> Zao: that sounds dangerous
21:28:18 <dons> Zao: yeah, that' would do it.
21:28:23 <dons> if you get the offsets right
21:28:38 <Zao> Which I didn't, at first :)
21:29:10 <dons> data types are weird in C -- how can they do anything without induction? it's so hard1
21:29:37 <ddarius> coinduction
21:30:16 <wli> The hard way, for everything, every time.
21:30:55 <sorear> Zao: use mallocArray and pokeElemOff
21:31:10 <sorear> that way your code is immune to sizeOf issues
21:31:14 <Boney> win
21:31:54 <Zao> Sounds nice, I must remember those.
21:32:24 <ac> Zao: is that really tho only way to draw pictures in OpenGL?
21:33:21 <Zao> ac: In some way, you need to get a C-style pointer to your chunk of texture data.
21:34:12 <Zao> Hackage seems to be lacking modules for image loading in general.
21:39:00 <dons> yeah
21:41:19 <nburlett> dons: I'm trying to install hs-plugins, but I'm getting an error: install: EvalHaskell.h: No such file or directory
21:42:40 <ac> what does it generally mean if I get a horde of "undefined reference" errors when compiling?
21:42:54 <nburlett> oh, wait, the compile didn't work :-<
21:44:39 <ac> like "...libHSGLUT-2.1.1.a(Begin__23.o): In function `GLUTzm2zi1zi1_GraphicsziUIziGLUTziBegin_mainLoop_info':
21:44:44 <ac> ghc6094_0.hc:(.text+0x3d): undefined reference to `glutMainLoop'"
21:46:12 <TSC> ac: How are you compiling it?
21:46:29 <ac> TSC: ghc --make Simple.hs
21:46:39 <KatieHuber> I'm joining in in the middle, but do you have your distro's glut-dev package installed?
21:46:52 <KatieHuber> probably called freeglut-dev these days
21:47:00 <ac> KatieHuber: probably not
21:47:13 <KatieHuber> that could be why, then ;)
21:47:34 <ivanm> with record style data types, is it possible to provide a default value for a particular field?
21:48:52 <TSC> You can make a value of the type with your defaults, and then derive new values from that
21:49:06 <TSC> So instead of "DataConstructor { a = 1, b = 2, ... }
21:49:20 <TSC> You'd write "defaultValues { a = 1, b = 2, ... }"
21:49:21 <ddarius> @oldwiki UsingRecords -- sigh
21:49:21 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/UsingRecords -- sigh
21:49:47 <ivanm> TSC: I know that, but I meant from within the datatype construction
21:49:50 <ivanm> ddarius: that link is dead
21:50:03 <ivanm> wasn't hawiki removed off the face of the earth?
21:58:39 <ddarius> ivanm: Hence the sigh
21:58:49 <ivanm> ahhh, k
21:58:57 <ivanm> just found it on the internet archive
21:59:14 <ivanm> only thing I hadn't found already was that you can use positional stuff with record types as well :o
22:01:02 <ac> KatieHuber: I installed freeglut-dev, still have the same compile errors
22:01:30 <ac> KatieHuber: It may have already been installed, I can't tell because my package manager had a fit
22:03:22 <KatieHuber> and you have /usr/lib/libglut.so ?
22:03:39 <ac> yeah, and .3
22:03:39 <KatieHuber> then I guess the next step is to check your haskell package database to find out what it's actually trying to link to
22:04:05 <ac> KatieHuber: how the heck do I do that?
22:05:57 <ac> KatieHuber: it's a binary file, isn't it?
22:06:12 <KatieHuber> `ghc --print-libdir`/package.conf is text
22:06:28 <bparkis> here's something else, on the subject of a commutative programming language
22:06:47 <bparkis> the simplest recursive data type of a commutative programming language is a set, not a list
22:07:26 <bparkis> no sorry, i think i'm wrong
22:08:13 <ac> what are the runtime requirements of Haskell? If use gtk2hs or OpenGL, are Haskell versions of those libraries required to run my program?
22:08:34 <ac> Or does the Haskell binary simply link to the C libraries?
22:08:53 <TSC> Just the regular libraries
22:10:31 <ac> cool. That makes distributing programs much much nicer
22:16:06 <ac> KatieHuber: I don't see anything suspicious in package.conf. In fact, it seems like almost nothing in there refers to /usr/lib
22:22:07 <ac> hm. I suppose I could use OpenGL within Gtk
22:24:28 <TSC> Or SDL
22:24:39 <TSC> (but I'm not sure how it works with sdl)
22:32:19 <ac> I have no trouble compiling C OpenGL programs...
22:51:27 <KatieHuber> ac: the GLUT module in package.conf should say extraLibraries = ["glut","X11"] or something?
22:52:17 <TSC> Oh, try "ghc --make Simple.hs -lglut -lGL", or something like that
22:52:53 <conal> is the old assembly-style interface to shader construction still available in OpenGL?  In HOpenGL?
22:53:27 <ac> TSC: ah, thanks.
22:54:51 <ac> TSC: figured it was something braindeadly simple like that
22:55:26 <TSC> I'm not sure if that's the "correct" solution
22:55:37 <ac> TSC: good enough for me
22:55:44 <TSC> Yeah, I thought so
22:55:47 <ac> ;)
22:57:38 <Zao> Oddly enough, I don't have to explicitly link at all.
22:59:04 <ac> KatieHuber:
22:59:04 <ac>  
22:59:04 <ac>  
22:59:16 <ac> ahg
22:59:40 <ac> KatieHuber: I just see extraLibraries = []
23:00:58 <ac> KatieHuber: I assume there's commands for updating the package database, that will free me from the odious task of manually linking things
23:01:42 <ac> that would probably be the "correct" solution
23:03:23 * ski wonders whether `(forall a. Either (f a) (g a)) -> Either (forall a. f a) (forall a. g a)' (modulo `newtype'-wrapping) ought to be definable in haskell (not counting partial implementations)
23:05:16 <sorear> ski: it's not definable in system F, so if you can define it in Haskell you've found a bottom in GHC's elaborator^H^H^Htypechecker
23:05:58 <ski> hence the *"ought"*
23:08:06 <sorear> oh
23:09:38 <ski> the argument being that a datastructure parametric in some tyvars should be examinable
23:10:28 <ski> i think this then relies on using erasure of type-lambdas, i.e. no type-passing
23:10:58 <kolmodin> if a lambdabot admin has a minute to spare, we've been missing her in #kedja @ quakenet for a while

23:13:11 <ac> how do I convert integers to Word8s?
23:13:16 <sorear> fromInteger
23:13:23 <kolmodin> yes, it worked
23:17:05 <KatieHuber> ac: the package database should reflect the appropriate commands to link on your system.  I wonder whether the order of installation (you clearly got HOpenGL before GLUT) played a part in screwing up yours
23:17:36 <ac> KatieHuber: HOpenGL came with my version of ghc
23:17:58 <ac> KatieHuber: and glut must have too, because I never installed either
23:21:33 <quicksilver> openGL and GLUT both come with the 'big ghc bundles'
23:21:51 <quicksilver> but on OS distributions where they split packages, they're in separate packages
23:22:15 <ivanm> isn't that because they used to be separate?
23:23:01 <quicksilver> no, it's just because distros like to separate out stuff which has dependencies, I think
23:23:29 <quicksilver> so ghc6-opengl-dev can depend on libgl-dev and libglut-dev, rather than ghc6 itself pulling in all those
23:23:45 <quicksilver> ac: ghc --make is *supposed* to link against the appropriate libs automatically, so something isn't quite right there
23:24:25 <ac> quicksilver: the part that you put on hpaste was everything but that
23:25:36 <araujo> hello
