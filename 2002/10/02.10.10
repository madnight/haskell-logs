02:36:06 * Marvin-- mutters
02:36:26 <Jii> why? ;-)
02:36:53 <Marvin--> because I got a return on an assignment and I don't agree with the reaons
02:39:41 <ludde> AFP?
02:39:52 <Marvin--> nod
02:39:53 <Marvin--> lab 1
02:40:04 <ludde> parallel composition? :)
02:40:08 <Marvin--> of course
02:40:30 <Marvin--> you too, huh?
02:40:32 <ludde> i didn't get a return on it, but i know many who got :)
02:40:50 <ludde> how did you implement it?
02:41:12 <Marvin--> We disallow (p1 >> p2) <|> p3 because we claim there is no sane way to do it.
02:41:24 <Marvin--> (mainly because the choice of turtle state is totally arbitrary)
02:41:29 <Marvin--> errr
02:41:36 <Marvin--> sorry, (p1 <|> p2) >> p3  of course
02:42:15 <Marvin--> "Decisions you have to make are: What happens after a parallel composition finishes?"
02:42:27 <ludde> i see your point.. what did they say in the return mail?
02:42:28 <Marvin--> We DID decide it, and motivated it, but apparently it wasn't good enough (no reason given, just "you have to implement this")
02:43:20 <ludde> heh, how stupid of them
02:43:29 <Marvin--> And with our deep embedding we actually can't implement the general bind operator, and there's no *reason* for having a general bind operator
02:43:32 <ludde> but.. I decided to make my parallel composition not commutative.
02:43:45 <Marvin--> what're you going to do with it? "My turtle program both draws AND calculates 2+3!"?
02:44:07 <ludde> it continues with p3 with the final state of p1 in the example above
02:44:23 <Marvin--> yeah, that's the way I'm inclined to do it, but it pretty much sucks
02:44:41 <Marvin--> our motivation is "there's no sane way to do it, so we force the user to explicitly say which way he wants it"
02:44:55 <Marvin--> maybe I've been coding too much explicit-is-better-than-implicit Python lately
02:45:07 <ludde> I think it's pretty silly to have a <|> in the first place, why not have a fork operation instead
02:45:39 <ludde> like in lab2
02:45:46 <Marvin--> heck, I'd pull an analogy to 'a < b == c' being impossible if I could :)
02:46:35 <Marvin--> yeah, you could do fork instead, but that makes the 'save' construct a bit unclear... oh well
02:46:40 <Marvin--> no, actually that makes save easier
02:47:04 <Marvin--> since you can say that  'save p1 >> fork p2' is the same as 'fork p2 >> p1'
02:47:28 <Marvin--> Maybe you could implement <|> in terms of a fork *ponder*
02:49:01 <Marvin--> grrr
02:49:11 <Marvin--> I'm going to go talk to Koen about this, it sucks
02:49:24 <ludde> was it roorda that corrected the lab?
02:54:13 <Marvin--> yes
04:26:04 <xkb_> hi
04:26:16 <xkb_> could someone give me an example of a heap-error?
06:57:15 <xkb_> could someone give me an example of a heap-error?
06:57:22 <Heffalump> what do you mean?
06:57:44 <xkb_> when does a heap error pop-up?
06:57:48 <xkb_> why does it?
06:57:54 <xkb_> that sort of things.
06:58:06 <Heffalump> DYM "out of heap space", or what?
06:58:06 <xkb_> In sort: a definition of a heap-error
06:58:11 <xkb_> yes..
06:58:18 <Heffalump> it shouldn't happen unless there's a compiler bug or you run out of heap space
06:58:27 <xkb_> something like that.. like the infamous: Out of Heap, buy new memory
06:58:38 <Heffalump> you run out of heap space because you tried to use too much stuff at once (maybe you had a space leak)
06:59:18 <xkb_> aha.. its not that I have this problem btw, Im doing research on exception mechanisms and im trying to compare the sollutions to several problems in different languages
06:59:33 <xkb_> and heap-errors is one of the problems I chose
06:59:38 <xkb_> are
07:00:10 <xkb_> perhaps i have a wrong idea of a heap
07:00:20 <xkb_> I thought a heap was like a stack
07:00:47 <xkb_> (hmmz.. I should also take an english course ;) )
07:00:59 <ski> it is usually not though of as a stack
07:01:07 <ski> (different behaviour)
07:01:10 <Heffalump> the heap is where things that can't go on the stack are put
07:01:26 <xkb_> ah.. so you have a stack AND a heap?
07:01:34 <ski> usually, yes
07:01:44 <xkb_> heap is in main-memory?
07:02:01 <ski> (some implementation implement the stack with the heap, so in that case you really only have a heap)
07:02:12 <xkb_> ok.. like that
07:02:36 <ski> depends on virtual memory and swapping and such things, i think
07:03:13 <xkb_> thus the heap is controlled by the OS, coupled to a process?
07:03:41 <Heffalump> the heap is controlled by the process, but it uses malloc to get more space from the main OS heap
07:03:51 <Heffalump> (in the case of memory-managed languages like Haskell)
07:04:08 <xkb_> ok.. let me write that down
07:05:20 <xkb_> Does haskell have some mechanism to detect heap-errors?
07:05:32 <xkb_> and continue program flow?
07:05:36 <Heffalump> No, it aborts.
07:05:39 <Heffalump> It does detect them.
07:05:42 <xkb_> darn
07:05:45 <Heffalump> The only error that should happen is out of space.
07:05:54 <xkb_> ok..
07:05:54 <Heffalump> Anything else is a compiler bug (I'm talking mainly about GHC here)
07:06:23 <xkb_> Are there any good books on heap vs stack etc?
07:06:57 <Heffalump> I don't know.
07:06:59 <xkb_> I hava Ado here and alot of other compiler books
07:07:04 <xkb_> s/hava/have
07:07:20 <xkb_> anyway. thanks for the help
07:07:32 <Heffalump> I think running out of space will first force a garbage collection, btw
07:07:42 <Heffalump> only if that doesn't recover enough will the program abort
07:08:07 <xkb_> hmm.. its kinda tough to come up with an example in haskell that causes heap-errors then
07:08:24 <Heffalump> not really, just make some huge data structure
07:08:37 <Heffalump> and make sure it's actually evaluated
07:09:00 <xkb_> some hash structure perhaps
07:13:47 <xkb_> Btw: what do you think: should exceptions in general use a continuation style? Ie continue problem flow after handling the exception?
07:14:47 <Heffalump> I don't know. What languages do that?
07:15:10 <xkb_> Java in some way
07:15:12 <ski> if one uses exceptions to signal say endoffile and similar non-errors (only "unusual") then the exception raised should obviously not continue
07:15:25 <xkb_> indeed..
07:15:45 <xkb_> you could however also use it as a control feature
07:15:53 <ski> or do you mean catching and continuing after the try-catch clause (in java-speak) ?
07:15:55 <xkb_> if EOF exception thrown continue processing
07:16:03 <Heffalump> Java doesn't use continuations, certainly.
07:16:24 <Heffalump> you can only continue from the catch block, not from where the exception was thrown
07:16:33 <xkb_> corrrect..
07:17:04 <xkb_> Im trying to think of a language that uses *real* continuation
07:17:10 <xkb_> cant think of any right now
07:17:11 <ski> i can't remember the languages that do provide the possibility to "retry", right now
07:17:50 <xkb_> I think that will cause loops very rapidly
07:17:56 <Heffalump> you could do it in Haskell, of course
07:18:18 <Heffalump> (it does have user-defined exceptions, right?)
07:18:30 <xkb_> Haskell is also based on graph reduction, isnt it?
07:18:48 <ski> well, i think at least some of the implementations are
07:19:15 <Heffalump> xkb_: effectively, yes
07:19:21 <Heffalump> though that's not guaranteed by the standard
07:19:32 <Heffalump> ski: yeah, I meant GHC, not Haskell 98
07:22:48 <xkb_> Eifel has a nice solution: It checks if the pre-condition of the corresponding loop still holds, and if it does retry.
07:23:17 <xkb_> Eiffel
07:27:59 <ski> xkb_ : well Scheme does support capturing of the implicit continuations. the New Jersey version of SML also provide this. (I think an earlier version of Rebol (??) had implicit continuation capture). (I seem to recall that some Smalltalk implementation also did this. And Stackless Python can do this also, i think). On the other hand i haven't seen many examples of langugaes with explicit continuations (no need for capture).
07:29:08 <xkb_> Cool.. Ill have a look at SML.. perhaps a good pointer for the implementation in other f. languages
07:29:18 <ski> xkb_ : One such example is IO. See part 3 of chapter 2 in "Advanced Programming Language Design" by Raphael Finkel, at e.g. http://www.awprofessional.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={92E30B39-5D91-45F9-9919-D202BE6341F9}&selectDescTypeId={A80972E0-1077-4518-954C-44E43E341DF7}
07:29:49 <xkb_> cool.. free fulltext online :)
07:30:04 <ski> (Perhaps also some ruby implementation, i'm not sure)
07:30:04 <xkb_> seems like a good book..
07:30:14 <ski> yes
07:31:04 <ski> (It also talks some about Exceptions and coroutines etc in that chapter)
07:32:33 <xkb_> thanks for the pointer
07:33:14 <ski> no prob
11:56:04 <dark> map greet (names #haskell)
12:01:27 <hdaume> :)
12:01:33 <hdaume> shouldn't that be mapM_?
12:02:13 <Igloo> Or mapM if it returns   m [Maybe Response]
12:03:51 <hdaume> yes, but clearly he's ignoring the responses :)
12:04:19 <dark> Heh :)
12:04:37 <dark> mapM_?  Does that do what I've been using sequence_ $ map for?
12:05:07 <hdaume> yup
12:10:21 <dark> Okay, I guess I'll be searching and replacing :-)
12:20:25 <toadx> Anyone here used the Q programming language?
12:39:36 <dark> No, never heard of it.
12:42:40 <dark> Hmm I wonder if ghc will figure out that lines . unlines is a no-op.
12:44:38 <dark> I decided stop wondering and avoid doing it instead :)
12:46:26 <hdaume> i doubt it will
12:47:42 <dark> I had one function that has unlines as its final step, and I fed it to another function that had lines as its first step.  Would there have been a way to catch that with a RULES pragma?
12:48:24 <dark> My current solution is to change the function interfaces, which seems to work okay :)
12:50:11 <hdaume> perhaps there's a rule for it...you could always write your own...but i think it would only fire if the first function were inlined...
12:51:22 <dark> Or both functions, if another function does the chaining?
12:51:34 <dark> I'm trying to figure out how rules really work :)
12:51:41 * hdaume doesn't really know : )
13:01:00 <andersca> Marvin--?
13:06:21 <Marvin--> yup
13:06:35 <andersca> I haven't gotten any reply about lab2
13:07:43 <Marvin--> even or odd?
13:08:40 <andersca> even
13:08:42 <andersca> 12
13:09:48 <Marvin--> yeah, I haven't had time to correct all the lab2 handins from Monday... I wanted to finish off lab1's first and then I've been attacking them chronologically...
13:10:12 <andersca> ok, cool
13:10:41 <andersca> just wanted to make sure that the hand-in worked
13:10:41 <andersca> thanks
13:10:43 <ludde> Marvin--: in my interpreter, i implement the environment as a stack of "activaition records", where each { } scope has its own activation record.
13:11:11 <ludde> Marvin--: is it okay to implement a grouping statement like this: (SGroup [Statement])
13:11:11 <Marvin--> There, now that I've booked presentation time and whatnot for the AFP, and I've sent in the application for doing my master project during spring (brr... :)), time to do some correcting
13:11:14 <ludde> Group:
13:11:14 <ludde>           (p1,[]:s) => _:s1
13:11:14 <ludde> -----------------------------------
13:11:14 <ludde>       (SGroup p1, s) => s1 
13:11:48 <Marvin--> As long as you make a note of that you're using haskell list syntax for your stack-of-local-states I don't see a problem
13:13:10 <ludde> also, how am I supposed to implement read/write from/to keyboard/screen ?
13:13:24 <ludde>        read_keyboard => x
13:13:24 <ludde> -----------------------------------
13:13:24 <ludde>       (SIn v, s) => s[v=x]  
13:13:25 <ludde> implement = specify in the semantics
13:13:51 <ludde> and
13:13:51 <ludde>        write_screen s[v]
13:13:52 <ludde> -----------------------------------
13:13:52 <ludde>       (SOut v, s) => s
13:14:19 <ludde> can I do it like that? _[_] is "overloaded" to work with a stack of states
13:14:29 <Marvin--> &"#¤% if you'd gone to lectures and/or classes you would probably know the answer to that question
13:15:07 <ludde> hmm, yeah.. i know.. is it better if I mail you then?
13:15:15 <dark> lectures? classes? so that's what all the students do while normal people are sleeping off their drinking binges :-)
13:15:31 <Marvin--> I don't have time to explain all that, please ask on a lab supervision time or something
13:15:41 <Marvin--> or do the exercises on semantics!
13:16:04 <ludde> Marvin--: so what I wrote above is wrong then, I suppose?
13:16:53 <Marvin--> ludde: it's *fairly* close to one way of doing it (called labelled transition semantics, but then you should probably do a small-step semantics, not a big-step semantics)
13:20:02 <dark> Is there a library function that does: zip xs (map f xs) ?  I need something like it fairly often, but I can't think of a good name for it.  zipWith is already taken...
13:20:31 <Heffalump> map (\x -> (x,f x)) xs
13:20:50 <Heffalump> more efficient too (if the compiler doesn't deforest the above)
13:21:04 <Marvin--> yay, deforestation
13:21:09 <ludde>     write_screen (s,s[v]) => s1
13:21:09 <ludde> -----------------------------------
13:21:09 <ludde>       (SOut v, s) => s1
13:21:09 <ludde> where write_screen writes a value to the list of output in the state,
13:21:09 <ludde> and returns the new state.
13:22:04 <dark> Heffalump: Thanks for the tip, but now I still need a name :)  (I do use this often enough that I want it to just be "foo f xs" for some foo)
13:22:31 <ludde> Marvin--: my interpreter is implemented using IO though, and the run statement function uses putStr / getLine
13:22:46 <ludde> Marvin--: so if I specify the semantics like that, it won't match up with my interpreter.
13:23:11 <ludde> Marvin--: is it still a Good Thing(tm) to do?
13:23:20 <hdaume> dark: if you have the functipn 'pair (f,g) a = (f a, g a)' then just map (pair (id,f)) xs (definition of 'pair' from bird)
13:23:41 <ski> ludde : still working on progs lab 3 ?
13:23:50 <hdaume> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/PointFree.hs for point free programming.  yay :)
13:23:56 <ludde> ski: I asked marvin-- about my write_screen solution, and it wasn't really good.
13:24:02 <Marvin--> ludde: mail progs about it, I don't have time to do on-the-fly supervision while correcting assignments!
13:24:18 <ludde> Marvin--: ok
13:26:54 <Marvin--> yay, pointless^H^H^H^H-free programming
13:27:16 <hdaume> *grin*
13:29:14 <ski> hdaume : you've also defined assocl and assocr :) (though i made a class for it so i could make both (,) and Either into instances for it)
13:30:41 <hdaume> ski: yeah, i suppose you could do that...my module is basically copied out of 'algebra of programming' with a few additions...
13:30:41 <hdaume> ski: i hardly ever use assocr and assocl though :)
13:32:04 <ski> hdaume : ok
13:33:50 <Marvin--> The (,,) and (,,,) et.c. are the ugliest constructors there are
13:33:51 <Marvin--> ugh
13:35:11 <dark> I think they're cute.
13:35:14 <ski> as prefix constructors at least (both type and value side)
13:35:51 <ski> I wouldn't have anything against using * on the type side as ML does
13:35:54 <ludde> what does the (,,) constructor do?
13:36:09 <dark> (,,) foo bar gnu constructs (foo, bar, gnu)
13:36:13 <hdaume> (,,) 1 2 3  = (1,2,3)
13:36:19 <ski> the (,,) value (data) constructor or the (,,) type constructor ?
13:36:23 <ludde> oh
13:37:08 <ski> though one can see (,,) and so on as sections (as (+) , etc)
13:37:29 <dark> Well (,) looks like a normal section... but (,,) a b is not (a ,, b)
13:37:45 <hdaume> can you do '(1,,) 2 3'?
13:38:00 <hdaume> ...guess not
13:38:54 <Igloo> I often wish for (5,) to be a valid section
13:38:54 <ski> e.g. instance Functor ((->) a)
13:38:54 <ski> yes, that would be consistent with other sections
13:38:55 <Marvin--> I accept (,) because (1,2) is like (1:[]), it's a valid operator so to speak
13:38:55 <ski> (though instance Functor (a ->) would be better, according to me)
13:38:55 <Marvin--> and yes (5,) would be very nice
13:39:01 <ski> (,,) is just mix-fix
13:39:10 <Marvin--> no, it's hodge-podge ;)
13:39:37 <ski> but even (,) is mix-fix (except in ocaml where one can write just  1,2 )
13:39:46 <Marvin--> yeah
13:39:50 <Marvin--> (and in python ;))
13:40:11 <ski> no, i would really like sometimes to write (small) expressions between ` `
13:40:25 <andersca> python is nice
13:40:46 <andersca> you can change the types of instanciated objects :)
13:41:03 <ludde> python is strange, you can add methods at run time, can't you
13:41:30 <ski> i think one can do that in Smalltalk also
13:41:39 <Marvin--> andersca: uhm, why (Monad Result) => ...? Result is already a monad...
13:42:01 <andersca> Marvin--: lemme check
13:42:34 <ski> andersca : usually the class predicates the the left of a "=>" contains at least one type variable
13:42:48 <Marvin--> andersca: ghci says "All of the type variables in the constraint `Monad Result' are already in scope" no shit, it doesn't have any type variables :)
13:43:04 <andersca> Marvin--: it's just a leftover from guard
13:43:08 <Marvin--> andersca: ok
13:52:07 <ludde> what does "Just separate the concerns as much as possible.
13:52:07 <ludde> "
13:52:09 <ludde> mean
14:11:12 <dark> My main problem with Haskell is that I keep finding better ways to express the same thing.  Some days I only make sideways progress :)
14:12:44 <Marvin--> heh
14:17:48 * Igloo screams upon discovering that multithreaded GTK doesn't work under GHC
14:18:13 <andersca> hmm
14:18:15 <andersca> that sucks
14:18:18 <Igloo> I wonder if this would be a good time to look at fudgets
14:18:49 <Marvin--> ouch, that sucks bigtime
14:19:46 <Igloo> It's because there is only 1 OS thread, so when you call gtkMain it just sits inside there and the other threads don't get to run
14:21:01 <Marvin--> doh
14:21:29 * Marvin-- swears about email viruses that spams his inbox
14:23:12 <Marvin--> ARGH, why can't the <beep> students hand in before the <beep> deadline?!
14:25:41 <hdaume> :)
14:26:43 <Marvin--> They better have a damn good reason, like all members of the group having been in a coma in a no-name hospital in Russia for a week
14:27:04 <ski> heh :)
14:28:10 <ski> Marvin-- : is it the second lab in progs ?
14:28:17 <Marvin--> good for them that the time stamps of their files are from before the deadline at least
14:28:19 <Marvin--> ski: yes
14:28:49 <dark> Marvin: ah, they figured out the timestamp trick? :)
14:28:54 <Marvin--> dark: ;)
14:29:14 <dark> I'm glad I stopped being a student.
14:29:36 <ski> Marvin-- : we handed in that one for more than a week ago, i think :)
14:30:39 <Marvin--> dark: I don't know if ufs has both modify and change, but on ext2 I don't think it's possible to touch -d away the 'change' stamp...
14:31:56 <dark> Marvin--: Yeah, but there are other ways.  Using a modified tar, for example.  Or running it under subterfugue.  Or if you're root, just changing the time :)
14:32:27 <Marvin--> true, a modded tar would do it, but I pray to god they're not root ;)
14:32:46 <dark> Marvin: Do you have any way to tell if the tarfile was generated on a university system?: )
14:32:47 <andersca> can't just check-in md5 the files?
14:32:55 <andersca> hand-in even
14:34:01 <Marvin--> well, the reporting system is wide open
14:34:53 <Marvin--> we don't get a tar file, but as soon as I get a hand-in I create my own tarball of their files (yes, I have read access to their files, muahaha) so they can't go change them after that
14:35:13 <Marvin--> (or, if you like, they *can* change them, for example if they need to do modifications for it to fit with the next assignment)
14:35:46 <Marvin--> But doing checksums of files would be neat, I'll keep that in mind if I ever design my own such system
14:36:24 <dark> Sounds like using a version control system would work too.
14:37:01 <Marvin--> yeah, but that's too advanced for the poor bastards ;)
14:37:14 <dark> I don't know of any free ones that have a notion of a privileged user, though, who could freeze tags that others can't then change.
14:38:31 <dark> I think arch could do it easily in another way, by making a local archive that refers to exact revisions in the central one.
14:39:23 <dark> Hmm, I think tar doesn't actually record the ctime.
14:41:27 <Marvin--> and in any case, how would it be able to "unpack" it?
14:41:41 <Marvin--> I mean, if tar can do it, why can't touch in that case?
14:49:48 <ludde> why not let the hand-in script tar.gz the files and mail them?
14:50:27 <Marvin--> quota problems I suppose
14:50:40 <Marvin--> since all the mails are forwarded to the people doing the correcting
14:50:58 <ludde> ok
14:51:05 <dark> Quotas are another thing I don't miss from my university days :)
14:51:10 <Marvin--> dark: :)
14:51:17 <dark> I think we had something ridiculous like 3 MB per user.
14:51:29 <Marvin--> one way of doing it would be to tar.gz it all to the supervisor account before forwarding the mail
14:51:41 <dark> A dozen students pooled parts of their space so they could have a GNOME installation.
14:51:50 <ludde> but that requires write access to the supervisor account, no?
14:52:12 <Marvin--> ludde: ah, I mean in the receiving end... it all goes through procmail and stuff
14:52:21 <ludde> ah
14:52:23 <Marvin--> And I do *not* want to go hack in that mess *at all* :)
14:52:33 <Marvin--> It's a mess of unreadable csh scripts and procmail rules
14:52:46 <dark> Marvin: Sounds dangerous, too.  If not done carefully, it could easily let a student take over the supervisor account.
14:52:56 <dark> Marvin: In fact, you might want to audit the current scripts :)
14:53:08 <Marvin--> dark: of course you need sanity checks
14:53:52 <Marvin--> The current scripts have been on their way out for years now, the new system will be in place "any time now" for the last few years
14:54:27 <ludde> why is the current system bad? i think it works quite well.
14:54:39 <Marvin--> and besides, if you want to wreak havoc on the student computer system, I think there are easier ways :)
14:54:46 <ski> Marvin-- : you mean DCE/DFS ?
14:54:48 <ludde> what does it matter if one can change their files after submitting?
14:55:10 <Marvin--> dark: and we actually have 50(60)M quota
14:55:11 <dark> hmm I haven't tried this with recent tars, but one trick was to make a tarfile with a symlink like "foo -> ../../.rhosts" followed by a file "foo".
14:55:37 <Marvin--> ludde: because it's what you hand in before the deadline that counts?
14:55:54 <Marvin--> ski: no I mean that the system is probably wide open to a gazillion (probably known) buffer overflow bugs and whatnots
14:56:06 <dark> Of course some tars will happily unpack ../../foo :-)
14:56:10 <ski> Marvin-- : ok
14:56:24 <Marvin--> ski: DFS is a mess too, and wreaks havoc on its own, but I'm talking about exploits
14:57:15 <ludde> Marvin--: why is it neccessarily like that? I mean as long as you have something to correct whenever you like to correct it, does it really matter if it was changed a few days after the deadline?
14:57:16 <andersca> what's dfs?
14:57:48 <ski> Marvin-- : i really don't know what this DCE/DFS is at all. just noticed a lot of yellow stickers and some problems logging in sometimes
14:57:58 <Marvin--> ludde: Yes. Deadlines are deadlines.
14:58:03 <dark> Marvin: This pattern of the "old" and "new" system is pretty common :)  Most company websites seem to be like that.  The result is, the old system is not maintained, but the new system never catches up because it has to deal with all the workarounds.  By the time the new system is finished, it doesn't meet the needs anymore.
14:58:07 <Marvin--> andersca: Distributed File System or something
14:58:14 <Marvin--> dark: oh yes
14:58:48 <Marvin--> andersca: NFS+AFS+crack or so ;)
14:59:13 <andersca> ah, ok
15:01:08 <dark> Hmm is there any strictness difference between "let" and "where"?
15:01:22 <dark> Or any semantic difference at all? :)
15:01:32 <ski> not that i can remember
15:01:51 <dark> I can never decide which of them to use.
15:02:12 <ludde> i usually use where when there's functions involved, and let otherwise
15:02:52 <Marvin--> dark: I wouldn't be surprised if the monomorphism constraint pops up somewhere there
15:03:40 <hdaume> dark: i usually use lets when the function acts like a pipeline, so you can read down the let block and basically follow the order of execution and wheres otherwise.  though usually if there is more than 4 or 5 lines i use a where either way...
15:04:10 <ski> i think let-bound variables and where-bound variables are equivalent in that (though not totally sure)
15:22:59 <dark> hdaume: I sometimes get confused about the layout rule for where :)
15:23:06 <dark> hdaume: especially when I use "do"
15:23:48 <Marvin--> well, when using do notation let is easier than without do notation, because it's all single column, sorta
15:23:54 <hdaume> dark: yeah...sometimes things end up looking a bit weird...
15:24:13 <dark> Defining functions in a let in a do looks strange :)
15:25:41 <Marvin--> well, if you want pattern matching and stuff, true
15:26:14 <Marvin--> wow, look at the time, I should go to bed
15:27:20 <dark> My astar function is one line that ends with "where", followed by three pages of code :)
15:27:39 <Marvin--> iik
15:28:14 <ski> hehe
15:28:19 <dark> There's two large function definitions in there, which I made local so that they can access the next and cost functions.
15:29:50 <dark> Oh, cool, it's actually only 40 lines :)
15:29:54 <dark> (I've been optimizing)
15:31:00 <ski> i wrote a scheme function for some time ago which was perhaps 3 pages long, which had lets and letrecs whose body where separated from the top of them by many lines of code. then i defined a where macro and also splitted it into a couple of functions
15:31:23 <ski> (it = the whole function)
15:31:52 <dark> The worst separation I've ever seen was in a C program :)
15:32:06 <ski> dark : so next and cost are bound inside your toplevel function ?
15:32:37 <dark> There was a function with a structure like: if (errorcondition) { ... part of error handling } else { ... 1800 lines of code; return } ... rest of error handling ...
15:33:21 <ski> now that's bad coding style, i'd say
15:34:04 <dark> ski: Yeah, astar get parameters "next", "est" (estimated cost), and "is_goal", which are used by its helper functions.
15:34:47 <dark> The top-level function body only uses the "start" parameter and invokes the first helper.
15:35:49 <ski> there's primarily two reasons for local variable/definitions : 0) you only wan't to hide implementation detail  1) you wan't to access non-local variables w/o having to pass them explicitely :)
15:35:58 <dark> The current version is slightly more hairy than the original but I got level generation down from 5 minutes to 2.5 seconds :-)
15:36:17 <dark> ski: What do you mean with 0?
15:37:10 <ski> the first reason would be better solved by a local-construct (as in SML) in many cases, i think. (also more "expressive"/convenient)
15:37:22 <dark> ski: In this case I'm happy with 1, because these "variables" are functions that never change within the context of astar.  So they act just like global function definitions if you're reading the code of the helper functions :)
15:37:27 <ski> 0 ?
15:37:37 <dark> ski: 0 is your first case, remember :)
15:37:43 <ski> just an ordering number : 0,1,2,3,...
15:37:50 <ski> yes
15:37:56 <dark> ski: Yeah I'm asking what you mean with your first case.
15:38:33 <ski> well, one can of course hide implementation detail with modules/namespaces
15:40:03 <ski> but, e.g. if one define a function with a helper accumulating (say) function, i usually hides this function inside the other one (with let or where) (except when the helper function is a useful function in its own right)
15:41:36 <dark> ski: Ah, now I see what you mean.
15:42:14 <dark> ski: Well I sometimes do it simply to conserve the namespace.
15:42:36 <ski> but, what about the case when you want to share some local definitions between more than one (outside visible) definition ?
15:42:49 <dark> ski: Sometimes the most sensible name for a function is just "f", but I don't want to declare that at module level :)
15:43:01 <ski> yeah, that too. so one can reuse "loop" all the time ;)
15:43:05 <dark> ski: Well at that point it becomes reasonable to create a module for those functions.
15:43:24 <ski> (like i always wanted in C=64 assembler :)
15:43:49 <ski> not always, i think.
15:43:59 <dark> Well I make lots of little modules :)
15:44:11 <dark> I currently have Util.Search which exports only astar.
15:45:09 <dark> ski: A86 allowed re-use of local labels L0 through L9 :)
15:45:39 <dark> ski: All you had to do was specify whether to search forward or back from the current position.  L0 was back, >L0 was forward.
15:45:42 <ski> in one lab here we weren't allowed to make more modules, and i wanted to hide a type implementation so that only the "primitive" operations had access to it, but not the "derived" ones. There should be no sign of the primitive/derived division on the module interface though, of course
15:46:12 <dark> Well that's an artificial restriction :)
15:46:54 <ski> dark : at least some assemblers on Amiga allowed local lables, and now some c=64 assemblers have "offset labels" also
15:47:12 <dark> Haskell's import/export mechanism is well suited for that, I think.  But not if you forbid making more modules :)
15:48:09 <ski> dark : seems that those L0 - L9 in similar to "offset labels" , though it sounds as "offset labels" may be a little more general
15:48:18 <dark> Hmm I even have some modules which only have a single data declaration :)
15:49:21 <hdaume> grrr..../me hates overlapping instance declaration errors
15:49:45 <ski> dark : (about the lab) well, sometimes i don't want to create a new module (and invent a new name, yurgh :) for just some small definitions. and besides, a local construct would be more symmetric wrt language design
15:50:38 <ski> dark : well that's acceptable (if the data-type is meant to be concrete)
15:50:48 <dark> Hmm sounds like what's needed is local module declarations :)
15:51:01 <hdaume> dark: i agree
15:51:13 <dark> I think the language allows them, but ghc --make doesn't like it.
15:51:21 <ski> a local-construct is sort of a light-weight module, perhaps
15:52:10 <dark> This could get hairy, the next logical step is to allow several modules to share a local module.
15:52:13 <ski> (no functors (or higher-order functors) or passing around them at runtime though, that's module stuff, not local-decl stuff)
15:53:24 <dark> Java tries to do this with its packages, but I think it fails miserably.
15:53:46 <ski> i think introducing a local-decl construct would not be semantically or implementationally difficult, though one has to define a syntax though
15:54:07 <ski> s/though//
15:55:56 <ski> perhaps one could reuse the let keyword, but just use it on top-level
15:56:44 <ski> like
15:56:56 <ski> let ... local definitions ...
15:57:11 <ski>  in ... exported definitions ...
15:57:41 <Heffalump> SML has local ... in ...
15:58:01 <ski> Heffalump : yes, that where i first saw it
17:32:01 <Chilli> Moin
17:32:15 <ski> hello Chilli
17:32:20 <ski> (Moin ?)
17:32:57 --- topic: set to 'ICFP 2002 Robot Analysis and Visualization Toolkit 0.9 http://tea.moertel.com/~thor/ravt/ || We put the Funk in Funktion || See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/ || Gtk+HS 0.14.10 released http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/gtk/ || ICFP is over' by Chilli
17:33:23 <Chilli> Moin is kind of synonymous for "hello" :-)
17:33:37 <ski> ok, didn't know that
17:34:28 <Chilli> well, it's Germany, but seems to be relatively widely know on irc
17:34:30 <ski> is it french or some other (non-english) language ?
17:34:35 <ski> ok
17:35:19 <ski> i've actually read German in 6 years at school. but i didn't know that word
17:35:20 <Heffalump> hiya
17:35:33 <Chilli> Hi Heffalump :-)
17:35:48 * Heffalump likes laptops with long-lasting batteries.
17:35:49 <Chilli> Heffalump: How was the trip back?
17:35:58 * Chilli too
17:36:07 <Heffalump> managed to work nearly the entire flight
17:36:33 <ski> Heffalump : you've been out travelling ?
17:36:52 <Heffalump> ski: yeah, PLI (Haskell workshop, ICFP + other conferences)
17:37:31 * Heffalump notes that Simon PJ hasn't said anything about the Haskell report vote on the mailing list yet and wonders if Chilli knows anything about his plans re that
17:37:33 <ski> Heffalump : sounds like fun
17:38:11 <Heffalump> ski: yeah - got a bit tiring near the end (it was a total of 5.5 days of talks...)
17:38:38 <ski> Heffalump : ok. me understand
17:39:00 * ski is quite tired right now
17:40:13 <ski> but i'll have to hand in a lab tomorrow (actually today now) midnight ..
17:40:30 <Chilli> Heffalump: I worked on part of the flight, but at some point I got to tired
17:40:52 <Chilli> (after all, it took over 24h)
17:41:22 <Chilli> Has Johan already sent his summary?
17:42:03 <Heffalump> I don't think so. 
17:44:07 <Heffalump> I guess I should wait for that.
17:47:20 <Chilli> I'll send Johan and SPJ an email
17:48:24 <Heffalump> personally I think the vote he took should be extended to the whole list (but then I suspect the list as a whole will be more against the move than the workshop)
17:49:03 <Chilli> it is difficult to vote on th elist
17:49:58 <ski> what were they voting on ?
17:50:04 <Heffalump> unless you expect people to fake votes, I don't see what the problem is
17:50:31 <Heffalump> ski: the "only copying for non-commercial uses" insertion into the copyright statement of the Haskell report (so it can be published as a book)
17:50:50 <ski> Heffalump : ok
17:51:53 <Chilli> Heffalump: yeah, I guess, you could set up an extra ml alias or procmail etc
17:52:44 <Chilli> I have actually talked to SPJ about the issue with Linux distributions etc again
17:55:30 <Heffalump> cool
17:55:37 * Heffalump reappears after VMware decided to crash
17:56:01 <Chilli> he wants to talk to the people who package Haskell stuff at the moment
17:56:26 <Heffalump> does anyone package the report for RH?
17:56:30 <Heffalump> I know it's in Debian
17:56:51 <Chilli> it's not in RH
17:57:07 <Heffalump> I don't mean "in RH", but are there packages around, like your GHC ones?
17:58:15 <Chilli> I packaged the old (non-revised) version ages ago
17:58:22 <Chilli> it's in my ftp area
18:00:50 * Heffalump notices "Copyright: Free noncommercial use" - is that a holdover from 1.4 or something?
18:01:42 <Chilli> maybe, not sure
18:03:34 <Chilli> was definitely done before the current copyright notice was inserted
