00:12:38 <shapr> hi adept
00:18:09 <adept> shapr: hi
00:18:36 <shapr> what's up?
00:19:53 <adept> shapr: <offtopic> have bought myself a palm, toying with LispMe on it :)
00:20:35 <shapr> cool!
00:20:43 <shapr> have you also tried Pippy?
00:20:53 <shapr> there's a python 1.5 that runs on Palm also
00:21:24 <shapr> I've read about Dolphin Smalltalk for the Palm, though I don't remember if it does onboard development such as LispMe and Pippy do
00:23:30 <adept> shapr: yes, it does. The only sad thing is that I mostly wanted the palm for reading books on the road and was tight on money, so it's Palm III -> not much memory for toying :)
00:23:59 <shapr> same here
00:24:04 <shapr> I have only 4mb on my Palm III
00:26:29 <adept> shapr: <even more offtopic> i already stripped palm bare of standard apps (mail, memo, databook, ...) and replaced them with DateBk4 and MegaLaunch. Now i'm thinking that that was not the wisest thing to do with respect to memory consumption. Do you use replacement launcher/datebook?
00:26:49 <shapr> I use DateBk4, which is great
00:26:53 <shapr> and I use MegaWiki
00:27:05 <shapr> and I have lots of random stuff installed, and I still have space left over
00:27:09 <andersca> hey shapr
00:27:11 <shapr> palm apps take up very little space
00:27:12 <shapr> hi andersca!
00:27:31 <ludde> hi andersca
00:27:38 <adept> andersca: 
00:29:30 <shapr> adept: I'm fond of progect.sf.net
00:29:40 <shapr> it's the dependency manager I've always wanted
00:30:33 <adept> shapr: hmm.. what kind of dependencies do you track with it?
00:31:24 <shapr> task dependencies mostly
00:32:26 <adept> maybe i should give it a second try. at first i thought that it fas superfluous ... (i'm sure that i've misspelled lat word :)
00:32:47 <shapr> actually, emacs says it's correct
00:32:54 * shapr uses emacs for irc client
00:34:09 <adept> shapr: eirc?
00:34:15 <shapr> nah, erc
00:34:16 <shapr> I'm using ERC 2.93 $Revision: 1.298 $ with XEmacs 21.4 (patch 8) "Honest Recruiter" XEmacs Lucid!
00:34:20 <shapr> erc.sf.net
00:36:38 <shapr> adept: many 3rd party apps on the Palm expect the default system apps to be available
00:37:02 <shapr> for example, MegaWiki turns memo into a wiki (mostly)
00:37:23 <shapr> with some extend features that integrate the standard datebook and todo apps.
00:37:43 <shapr> syncbbdb is cool if all your contact have latin-1 chars only
00:38:25 <shapr> er, actually, syncbbdb crashes and burns with non-ascii, not non-latin1
00:38:27 <adept> syncbbbdb - is it .el or .prc thing? :)
00:38:42 <shapr> it's mostly .el
00:38:47 <shapr> it's a deb if you use debian.
00:39:35 <shapr> I recently tried GSMtool on my Palm III to pull all my numbers out of my 6310, and now they're all in my BBDB as well.
00:39:37 <shapr> pretty nifty.
00:40:05 <shapr> now if only I could use my Palm III as an IrDA port, I could install new java midlets onto my 6310
00:40:24 <adept> shapr: why you cant?
00:40:38 <shapr> maybe I can, but I don't know how to do it
00:40:41 <adept> shapr: so you have 6310i actually, right?
00:40:47 <shapr> yah, I do
00:41:02 <shapr> it's nice, though I need to upgrade the firmware
00:41:09 <shapr> it crashes when I start bluetooth sometimes.
00:41:13 * adept is looking enviously at his 6310
00:41:27 <shapr> only reason I got 6310i is because I need triband
00:41:34 <shapr> since my family lives in the USA
00:41:49 * shapr is afraid to think of roaming prices from USA to Finland
00:43:04 * adept :)))
00:43:32 <adept> it's better to use something like "voice-over-sms" in that case :)
00:44:04 <shapr> heh!
00:44:16 * adept works for mobile comms provider :)
00:44:43 * adept yes still afraid to think about roaming prices ... :)
00:44:56 <shapr> which provider do you work for?
00:45:10 <shapr> do you know if the US offers GPRS nowadays?
00:45:23 <adept> Ukrainian Mobile Communications. I doubt if you ever heard of it :)
00:45:30 <shapr> that's true, I haven't
00:45:55 <shapr> I'm not a mobile comm expert, that's probably wh.
00:45:58 <shapr> er, "why"
00:46:24 <adept> shapr: well, since even we offer GPRS, i think US does, too. But then, i never been there, never even heard.
00:46:27 <shapr> I have done some Java on Symbian development, since one of my employers is a mobile dev company
00:46:51 <shapr> there were rumors of GHC -> java bytecode
00:47:08 <shapr> I'd very much like that, I could write code in Haskell and run on my 6310i :-)
00:47:27 <shapr> adept: I wish I'd had the extra money for a 7650, but no such luck
00:47:38 <shapr> adept: I've used the 9210 enough to know I don't want one
00:48:06 <adept> i got a hold on 9210 and that second i knew i dont want one :)
00:48:20 <shapr> they're cool, but not user-friendly
00:48:23 * adept thinks about haskell programs on palm :)
00:48:31 <shapr> that would be awesome :-)
00:48:48 <shapr> I've heard hugs runs on the Sharp Zaurus
00:49:03 <shapr> I wonder how they got it to fit...
00:50:09 <shapr> is there some way to get haskell running on a Palm?
00:50:20 <shapr> afaiu, the runtime system is too large... is that true?
00:50:53 <shapr> adept: what are you using to view books on your palm?
00:53:49 <adept> shapr: seems like that, runtime wount fit. but then there is caml-light, which does not have toplevel for palm, but produces palm apps. I wonder if it's possible to do an off-board development, or libraries will be way too big?
00:53:53 <adept> shapr: weaselreader
00:54:59 <shapr> off-board dev would work if the libraries could be linked piecemeal
00:55:26 <shapr> from what I've seen, the Prelude requires lots of other libs, each of which is fully and statically linked
00:55:50 <adept> shapr: exactly....
00:56:24 <adept> shapr: speaking of books, i wonder if its possible to add bzip2 compression to weaselreader...
00:56:28 * shapr dunno
00:57:05 <adept> and what do you use?
00:58:10 <adept> for reading books, i mean
00:58:44 <shapr> well, lately I carry around the books :-)
00:58:52 <adept> :))))
00:58:53 <shapr> because I like to make notes in the margins
00:59:05 <shapr> I tried to do that on my palm, but I wore out the graffiti pad
00:59:10 <shapr> it's deeply scratched
00:59:16 <adept> shapr: exactly. that's why i use weasel reader - annotations! :)
00:59:30 <shapr> only after I shredded my graffiti pad did I read about ways to preserve it
00:59:52 <adept> wow.... what ways? (/me is afraid to wore scratch pad)
01:00:33 <shapr> if you can find some thin transparent tape, you can cut a square to the correct size and place it over your writing area
01:00:48 <shapr> I wore mine out partly from annotating, and partly from playing nethack on my palm ;-)
01:01:25 <adept> nethack? i've seen Moria and couple of others, but nethack. Where can i find it? maybe ADOM too? :)
01:01:44 <shapr> what's ADOM?
01:05:15 <jagular> http://nethack-palm.sourceforge.net/ , http://www.adom.de/ .. doesn't have a palm version, though..
01:06:08 <adept> adom - www.adom.net, i believe. very similar to nethack, yet different in many ways.
01:06:41 <shapr> nethack isn't so compatible with a kinesis keyboard mapped to dvorak
01:08:36 <adept> :)))
01:12:54 <adept> kinesis ... it's the keyboard with keys going deeper below with each row, right?
03:31:23 <shapr> adept: er, if you mean the two halves of the keyboard are bowl shaped, then yes
03:54:53 <shapr> hi loom2
04:11:39 <loom2> hi shapr.
04:11:46 <shapr> hi hi
04:40:53 <shapr> hi pesco
04:40:59 <pesco> Hoi.
04:41:04 <shapr> wassup?
04:41:18 <pesco> I spent last night coding in C++.
04:42:00 <pesco> Yourself?
04:42:37 <shapr> I spend last night sleeping.
04:42:51 * pesco nods dreamily.
04:42:58 <pesco> Sleep... right.
04:43:10 <shapr> unusual for m
04:43:11 <shapr> but fun
04:43:15 <shapr> er "me"
04:43:32 <pesco> Yah, sleeping is cool.
04:46:38 <shapr> but boring
04:46:48 <shapr> pesco: what are you writing?
04:47:09 <pesco> bosse, a biff variant
04:48:42 <Igloo> How is it better?
04:48:51 <pesco> It's worse. :)
04:49:08 <Igloo> How will it be better?  :-)
04:50:27 <pesco> Oh. It will outrun the Moaning Goat Meter in looks, support multiple mailboxes of course, do session management through Gnome, and pour coffe on toast.
04:50:57 <Igloo> :-)
04:51:02 <Igloo> Why C++?
04:51:23 <pesco> Because I know I'll be able to do it in that.
04:52:05 <pesco> Doing it in Haskell right away would have made me uncomfortable because I'd have to jump into multiple unknown libraries and still write a nice biff variant.
04:52:29 <Igloo> Well, you can port it later  :-)
04:53:14 <pesco> Exactly. :)
04:55:26 <pesco> Also, in order to take its well-deserved place next to the "ornamentum rosaceum infornum pratulis" on everyone's desktop, unconditionally depending on GHC might be a hinderance.
04:55:41 <pesco> s/infornum/infernum/
04:56:07 <Igloo> The what?
04:56:37 <Igloo> And that wouldn't be a problem for anyone using, say, binaries from a Linux distro
04:56:58 <Igloo> And it would encourage more people to install a Haskell compiler, which is clearly a good thing  :-)
04:57:36 <pesco> True. And it would of course add to the mandatory bloat-factor.
04:58:02 <Igloo> What would?
04:58:42 <pesco> Using Haskell.
04:59:04 <Igloo> Your search - ornamentum rosaceum infernum pratulis - did not match any documents.
04:59:07 <Igloo> The alternate search- ornamentum rosaceus infernum protulis - also did not match any documents. 
04:59:22 <Igloo> Because it needs GHC installed or because Haskell binaries are bloated?
04:59:24 <pesco> Not so far as run-time efficiency is concerned, just in terms of compile-time complexity.
04:59:33 <Igloo> If the latter then it would provide more incentive to fix that  :-)
04:59:35 <pesco> Yes, GHC.
04:59:39 <Igloo> Ah, right
05:00:00 <pesco> http://www.xiph.org/mgm/index.html
05:02:23 <Igloo> Ah  :-)
05:02:39 <pesco> Definately one of my all-time favourite peaces of software.
05:04:58 <pesco> pieces.
05:49:08 * shapr bounces happily
05:49:12 <Heffalump> hello
05:49:15 <shapr> hi Heffalump
07:48:33 <slicks> anyone has excercises about haskell for learning purpose ? i have that neat tutorial of hal duame, but i feel like doing excercises :)
07:51:19 <slicks> zouden ze automatische logout hebben ingesteld?
07:51:24 <slicks> oops sorry
07:51:39 <ayrnieu> slicks - go through the 'two dozen exercises in haskell' tutorial.
07:52:06 <slicks> ok
08:20:18 <slicks> is there a way to enter a definition using hugs/ghci interpreter?
08:20:29 <slicks> Prelude> x =1
08:20:29 <slicks> <interactive>:1: parse error on input `='
08:22:00 <cleverdra> let x = 1
08:22:14 <cleverdra> let fac 0 = 1; fac n = n*fac(n-1)
08:22:27 <slicks> oh
08:22:40 <cleverdra> I don't think that works in hugs, though.
08:24:08 <cleverdra> Note that the following does not work:
08:24:11 <cleverdra> let fac 0 = 1
08:24:15 <cleverdra> let fac n = n*fac(n-1)
08:26:32 <slicks> ok
08:26:35 <slicks> thanks alot
08:27:09 <cleverdra> you're welcome a lot.
08:37:16 <pesco> hey hdaume.
08:37:25 <hdaume> hey pesco
08:37:46 <pesco> I just read a mail you posted to the GHC list about Show instances of Foo.
08:38:01 <pesco> Is that problem still recent?
08:38:22 <hdaume> yeah? :)
08:45:37 <hdaume> yup
08:45:37 <pesco> I'm not sure, but couldn't it be that the results you were seing were what's supposed to be there?
08:45:37 <hdaume> i don't think so.
08:45:37 <hdaume> saying 'newtype Foo = Foo Int deriving (Show)' and 'newtype Foo = Foo Int deriving (Show,Num)' should not yield two different instances of Show
08:45:37 <Igloo> (Foo 5) + 4 shouldn't be valid I wouldn't have though
08:45:37 <Igloo> Oh, you get fromInteger/fromIntegral too I guess
08:45:37 <pesco> Sure, if instance Num Foo.
08:45:37 <hdaume> if Foo is an instance of Num, then '4' can have type Foo
08:45:37 <pesco> Yes, and there's (+) for Foo.
08:45:37 <pesco> Try :t 4 in ghci.
08:45:37 * Heffalump IRCs from the Haskell workshop, just cos he can
08:45:37 <Igloo> Yes, I agree now I remember fromIntegral
08:45:37 <Igloo> :-)
08:45:37 * pesco shakes Heffalumps hand in awe.
08:45:37 <pesco> Igloo: It's not about fromIntegral, is it?
08:45:37 <pesco> The literal 5 is just of type forall t. (Num t) => t
08:45:37 <Igloo> Only because it's syntactic sugar for fromIntegral 5 I think
08:45:37 <hdaume> right
08:45:37 <pesco> Hm, ok.
08:45:37 <pesco> Ah, right, I remember now. Thanks.
08:45:37 * Igloo agrees, anyway. Sounds like GHC bugs.
08:45:48 <pesco> Ah, yah, actually I think so too.
08:45:54 <pesco> Actually, I'm sure.
08:46:48 <pesco> Lets pray Simon "GHC suppurt comes back before
08:46:53 <pesco> Bah, damn return key.
08:47:06 <pesco> Lets pray Simon returns before someone gets hurt by the bug.
08:47:35 <Heffalump> what bug?
08:47:50 <Igloo> Well, anyone relying on non-H98 functionality deserves anything they get anyway  :-)
08:47:52 <Heffalump> oh, right
08:48:05 <hdaume> Igloo: hey...i take that as a personal offense
08:48:16 <pesco> The "Show instances of Foo Nums" bug.
08:48:56 <Igloo> Really? You don't think relying on the behaviour of an unspecified language whose semantics might be deliberately changed tomorrow is foolish?
08:49:15 <pesco> Not in this case.
08:49:23 <Heffalump> I think it depends what you're doing
08:49:48 <Igloo> My first comment was meant in jest anyway, hence the smiley
08:49:54 <hdaume> Igloo: well, i dont' think i use anything really weird in the extensions :)
08:50:41 <hdaume> pattern guards, a little mptc+fundeps but not much, unboxed types, derivations over newtypes (which i don't use anymore, incidentally)...i think these are failrly safe
08:50:49 <hdaume> i wouldn't tough linear imp params with a 10 foot pole
08:50:53 <hdaume> s/tough/touch
08:51:05 <Igloo> pattern guards?
08:51:21 <pesco> Hey does anyone know why hugs eats such humungus amounts of memory with increased heap sizes (like 10M or so)?
08:51:21 <hdaume> f x | Just y <- foo x = bar
08:51:40 * Igloo prefers to stick to plain old H'98 whenever possible. More protable code and I get to complain at other people if it breaks  :-)
08:52:19 <Igloo> What's the type of foo?
08:52:23 <hdaume> i used to aim for h98, but lost my will after a while...it's obnoixous though because i can't use things like HAT, which would be really nice
08:52:27 <hdaume> say, Int -> Maybe Int
08:52:55 <hdaume> so, 'f x l | Just y <- lookup x l = "found it"'
08:53:18 <Igloo> OK, that looks nice
08:53:23 <hdaume> it's very nice
08:53:44 <hdaume> especially when you have a lot of pattern guards...it saves you many case expressions/many sub functions
08:53:47 <Igloo> Saves defining isFoo lots, and more complicated variants
08:53:53 <hdaume> yeah
08:54:54 <Igloo> Of course with Template Haskell you'll be able to make those automagically  :-)
08:55:21 <hdaume> research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/Haskell/guards.html is very good
08:55:31 <Heffalump> oh, Simon PJ mentioned you in his talk, btw :-)
08:55:34 <Heffalump> (Igloo)
08:55:49 <Igloo> Cool - what'd he say?
08:55:55 <Igloo> Just that I was working on it?
08:56:31 * Igloo pushes that to reading list
08:56:33 <Heffalump> yeah
08:56:43 <Heffalump> about the type system stuff
08:56:57 <Igloo> Soft types?
08:57:06 <Igloo> Or just the double type-checking?
08:57:55 <Heffalump> soft types
09:04:31 <slicks> how do you import (standard) libraries in ghci?
09:04:41 <slicks> (without using files)
09:04:56 <hdaume> :m ModuleName
09:05:01 <Igloo> You can use them as List.intersperse etc
09:05:06 <hdaume> (where ModuleName is a list of module names)
09:05:14 <slicks> hdaume: cool tutorial !
09:05:31 <slicks> it just needs some excercises
09:05:35 <hdaume> slicks: questions, comments, suggestions are more than welcome
09:05:44 <hdaume> slicks: i know...i do have a full time job though :)
09:05:49 <slicks> ok :)
09:17:58 <hdaume> slicks: at what point in the tutorial did you want to know how to use std lib functions in ghci?
09:29:13 <slicks> hdaume: i'm reading another tutorial full of examples/excercises atm
09:30:04 <hdaume> ah okay
09:30:05 <slicks> two dozen of excercises
09:30:12 <slicks> someth like that
09:30:16 <hdaume> i've read that :)
09:30:22 <slicks> i just need some practice
09:30:29 <hdaume> i know the feeling
12:09:49 <Heffalump> hmm, apparently Finnish has 15 cases
12:11:08 <cleverdra> mmmm, Finnish.
12:11:32 <cleverdra> (Not that I know it, but it looks nifty.  One of the languages that I intend to learn some day.)
12:59:41 <slicks> those cases are very easy though
12:59:56 <slicks> cases are almost like suffices
13:47:48 <engstad> Greets. Did we ever get the results of the icfp contest?
13:48:55 <Igloo> They won't be available until the end of ICFP will they?
13:49:34 <Igloo> Which is 6th Oct
13:59:09 <engstad> Ok, thanks.
14:07:22 <Heffalump> they'll be announced on Saturday
14:07:32 <Heffalump> I'll try to provide live commentary :-)
14:09:07 <Igloo> Can you buy a webcam before then?  :-)
14:10:49 <Heffalump> are you paying? :-)
14:11:56 <Igloo> Hmmm  :-)
14:13:03 <slicks> easy question.. how do i print an integer? (cant find it in a few tutors)
14:13:31 <Igloo> print
14:24:15 <Heffalump> Simon PJ declares the revised report done
14:25:11 <Igloo> Cool
14:25:35 <engstad> slicks: What do you mean with "print" an integer?
14:26:08 <Heffalump> he says the online version will definitely still remain available
14:26:37 <Heffalump> he's consulting about the copyright
14:26:47 <slicks> engstad: show the value of an integer value on the screen 
14:26:52 <slicks> print did fine
14:26:59 <Igloo> Hmmm
14:27:55 <Heffalump> he thinks the non-commercial thing is quite generous of CUP
14:28:15 <Heffalump> he says a couple of people emailed him saying this wasn't reasonable
14:29:03 <Heffalump> apparently CUP are being asked to delete it, and they might, it's still with their legal team
14:29:32 <Igloo> Is this the copyright being applied to the online version?
14:29:36 <Heffalump> I assume so
14:30:00 <Heffalump> He says the cost will be £25-30ish, btw
14:30:16 <Igloo> Of the book?
14:30:23 <Heffalump> Anthony Courtney asks about the online distribution
14:30:27 <Heffalump> Igloo: yes
14:32:15 * Igloo splutters at mit-scheme 7.7.1-1 [17.5MB]
14:32:45 <engstad> Now, that's something to drool over: http://www.mobilenews.ne.jp/news/2002/10/01/ceatec/01sharp.html
14:33:55 <Igloo> What's good about it?
14:34:27 <engstad> 640x480 screen. :-)
14:34:54 <Igloo> Oh, it's a PDA! Right, making more sense now
14:35:07 <engstad> Yes, it's the new Zaurus (running Linux).
14:36:43 <hdaume> one of the guys at AFP got hugs to run on that
14:36:58 <engstad> Cool! :-)
14:38:49 <Heffalump> he's calling a vote
14:38:52 <engstad> Gawd, I simply can't figure out this bug! I hate assembly sometimes.
14:39:55 <hdaume> :)
14:40:43 <engstad> Hefgfa: Where U at?
14:41:27 <Heffalump> Haskell Workshop
14:43:26 <Heffalump> hmm. 7 against any acceptance of a non-commercial restriction, 30 for the restriction if needed, another 14 if the restriction doesn't apply to electronic distribution
14:43:59 * Igloo thinks about e-mailing him
14:44:13 <Heffalump> well, he'll post the results to the list
14:44:57 <Igloo> In a "here are the results" sort of a way or a "What are your views" sort of a way?
14:45:25 <Heffalump> I'm not sure
14:45:38 <Heffalump> he said the problem with the list is that the silent majority is ignored
14:45:44 <Heffalump> I'd like him to extend the vote to the list
15:06:12 <Heffalump> hmm, apparently he's taking a decision from this vote.
