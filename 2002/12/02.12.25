03:30:38 * sethk is away: Don't say anything until I return.
04:17:46 <randyte> Do you guys all develop in Haskell? You probably write math applications... right?
04:24:14 <dennisb> I mainly write compilers, interpreters and such things. Haskell is very, very nice for that
04:27:30 <randyte> ohh... I though it was used mainly for mathematics
04:28:09 <randyte> I was gonna say that if one needs to do math programs.. won't one be better off using matlab....etc...
04:30:20 <lament> probably.
04:30:22 <dennisb> I agree, for math it's better to use something like matlab, maple, whatever. Haskell is a general programming language
04:32:01 <dennisb> For me the absolute best thing in haskell is the algebraic datatypes. It's not very hightech but it's the thing I want the most when I program in other langauges. 
04:42:55 <lament> they're pretty high-tech
04:44:18 <randyte> I took a class in university... I had to learn Scheme
04:44:31 <randyte> it would've been nice if they taught us Haskell
04:44:38 <randyte> at least its more popular
04:45:19 <dennisb> lament: Yes, it's not easy to add to just any language. But still, it's nowhere near as complicated and cool as other things in haskell
04:47:13 <dennisb> The more languages you know the merrier
05:23:28 <Janni> hi
05:37:58 <lament> Haskell is more popular than scheme?
05:38:08 <lament> (and why is that good?)
05:48:54 <lament> oh well.
08:09:25 <Janni> re
08:10:33 <mgoetze> hi
12:09:54 * stepcut wants extensible records in GHC for Christmas
12:34:39 * sethk is back (gone 09:04:02)
16:03:24 <spank> hi
16:04:20 <clausen> oi spank
16:04:35 <clausen> lots of portuguese blokes/chicks on #haskell :)
16:04:42 <spank> hehhe
16:04:49 <spank> word
16:05:03 <clausen> lots of .pt universities seem to teach haskell in 1st year
16:06:50 <spank> yeah
18:16:50 <Rainer> An example prog with input and output in Daumes tutorial consumes all input b4 it gives (all) output. Intendet behaviour is outp,inp,out,.. How to typically fix this?
18:17:44 <Rainer> It's a number guessing example
18:18:43 <Rainer> I'm using ghc
18:21:50 <Rainer> It works as expected with hugs
18:24:17 <Rainer> Buffering is set to LineBuffering btw
