05:08:24 <Marvin--> hello shapr
05:10:01 <shapr> hi Marvin--
05:10:02 <shapr> what's up?
05:12:14 <Marvin--> I'm debugging C code :/
05:12:25 <shapr> fun
05:13:00 <shapr> I wonder if QC tests could be turned into useful parts of a proof for Haskell code
05:13:07 <shapr> or maybe you could go in the other direction
05:13:42 <Marvin--> I've been thinking about it
05:14:03 <Marvin--> the problem is that you have different demands on the language used for describing tests and proofs
05:14:37 <Marvin--> for testing you want tight integration with the host language which is what QC does
05:14:50 <Marvin--> for proving you need a *representation* of the program so you can manipulate it, do induction and stuff
05:18:21 <Marvin--> but on the other hand you don't want to limit the expressiveness of the language used for proving, so you'd look at having a full-blown or almost full-blown haskell parser, and then you'd want type inference too... ugh
05:18:35 <shapr> sounds like Core would be better
05:18:47 <Marvin--> well, yes
05:18:57 <Marvin--> of course you translate it
05:19:41 <Marvin--> and there's Language.Haskell.Parser that takes care of parsing, but doing type inference could be a bitch
05:20:30 <shapr> does Core do static typing?
05:20:38 <shapr> as in, do you still need to do inference?
05:24:02 <lament> Does anyone know a natural language that gives more attention to relationships rather than objects?
05:24:51 <shapr> check out agglutinative languages
05:24:56 <Marvin--> hmm, Language.Haskell.Parser only parses it, doesn't convert it to Core... the Core stuff isn't exposed, right?
05:25:12 <shapr> I only know that you can get Core with -fext-core
05:25:29 <Marvin--> uh?
05:26:17 <Marvin--> what do you mean?
05:26:20 <shapr> ghc -fext-core --make Foo.hs
05:26:27 <shapr> you get Foo.hcr
05:26:29 <Marvin--> oh
05:26:48 <shapr> it sounds like you want access to the Haskell -> Core parser?
05:26:53 <Marvin--> yes
05:27:45 <shapr> from what I've read, I think you would have to write a GHC plugin (?)
05:28:04 <shapr> or whatever you call the more general case of optimization pass, rewrite pass, etc
05:29:43 <Marvin--> I don't want to interface with the compiler... I want to translate the Haskell code to a simpler representation, and since there already is one, Core, why should I implement my own hack?
05:39:47 <shapr> sounds like Core is the right way to go
05:40:06 <shapr> oh, I had another thought
05:40:35 <shapr> principal typing.. or any kind of static typing, is sort of a proof
05:42:07 <Marvin--> ?
05:42:30 <shapr> look at Simon PJ's financial instruments paper
05:43:10 <shapr> he used the type system to prove that Enron was worth zero (or something like that)
05:43:27 <lament> shapr: are you sure agglutinative has anything to do with relationships?
05:43:54 <shapr> lament: no, I'm not sure
05:44:19 <Marvin--> shapr: are you talking about "an adventure in financial engineering"?
05:44:28 <shapr> sounds like the right paper
05:44:31 <shapr> I don't remember the title
05:45:55 <shapr> a value has two pieces, data, and type
05:46:24 <shapr> when a program fails to compile, the type system is saying that your program has failed to prove its correctness
05:46:33 <Marvin--> "At this point, any red-blooded functional programmer should start to foam at the mouth, yelling 'build a combinator library'."
05:47:19 <shapr> I think that's what the creator of Forth meant when he said that types are a crutch
05:48:17 <Marvin--> but there are several type correct programs that don't yield a desired result, right?
05:48:22 <Marvin--> or are we talking about different things?
05:48:48 <shapr> no, I think we're talking about the same things
05:49:29 <ibid> no, the type system is saying that whatever the program is, it is not correct :-)
05:49:31 <shapr> it seems to me that a type system can have a certain 'strength' or maybe 'strictness'
05:49:32 <shapr> I dunno
05:49:46 <shapr> right!
05:49:54 <shapr> some type systems know more about correct than others
05:50:02 <ibid> for some definitio of "correct"
05:50:05 <Marvin--> well yes, if the typing fails, it cannot be correct, but if the typing succeeds you don't know a whole lot
05:50:17 <Igloo> What do you mean by "desired result"?
05:50:18 <Marvin--> (except that there are no type errors)
05:50:24 <shapr> if you're using the type system as your main tool, you do know a lot
05:50:54 <shapr> if you compare writing an interpreter in Haskell to creating ADTs
05:50:54 <ibid> most type systems do have limitations that would not be there were the language (statically) untyped
05:50:56 <Marvin--> Igloo: invariants... reverse (reverse xs) == xs should always be True, but there are several type-correct definitions of reverse where this doesn't hold
05:51:17 <shapr> Marvin--: I'd like to hear more about that..
05:51:23 <ibid> Marvin--: that's a weak meaning of "the desired result"
05:51:24 <Marvin--> shapr: ?
05:51:25 <shapr> I gotta go, I'll be back inna bit
05:51:28 <shapr> invariants..
05:51:29 <Marvin--> ibid: yes
05:51:30 * shapr goes
05:52:01 <Marvin--> but my point is that I don't see how the typing helps a lot when I want to prove correctness of propositions like reverse (reverse xs) == xs
05:52:47 <ibid> there was an article in the SIGPLAN notices that just was delivered to me (some functional programming proceedings issue) about traditional predicates about functional programs being undecidable and thus meaningless
05:52:53 <ibid> anybody know what's that about?
05:53:08 <Marvin--> haven't heard of it
05:53:08 <ibid> even the predicates used in imperative programming are undecidable
05:53:32 <ibid> maybe they are using yet another definition of "undecidable"
05:53:40 <Marvin--> heh
05:53:41 <ibid> it's a fairly overloaded word
05:54:08 <ibid> they said it had something to do with higher-order functions
05:54:36 <ibid> hmm, maybe they refer to the result that there is no Hoare logic for a proper functional language?
05:54:50 <Marvin--> I don't know anythinga bout Hoare logic :/
05:55:02 <ibid> basic stuff in formal methods
05:55:24 <Marvin--> oh wait, is it the {p}S{q} stuff?
05:55:29 <ibid> yeah
05:55:32 <Marvin--> okay
05:55:49 <ibid> well actually, it's a family of logics built upon that stuff
05:56:29 <ibid> essentially, you can define a programming language by giving its Hoare logic ie. inference rules for all composite statement/expression kinds
05:57:23 <ibid> btw, /me just got notification that my employment here has been renewed for one year and eight months
05:58:00 <Igloo> Cool
05:58:08 <ibid> yeah
05:58:28 <ibid> and i get a pay raise at the same time due to my new degree
06:00:23 <ibid> this paper -> http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=583852.581484
06:00:30 * Igloo bangs his head against a DMR-shaped brick wall
06:01:10 <Marvin--> DMR?
06:01:14 <Marvin--> ibid: congrats
06:01:26 <Igloo> Dreaded Monomorphism Restriction
06:01:35 <Marvin--> oh
06:01:38 <Marvin--> ouch
06:04:12 * Marvin-- is starting to like valgrind
06:15:03 <Marvin--> bah, screw this, I'm going to play some civ3
06:28:25 <emu> type systems can also weed out correct programs, the trivial example being 1 + if true then 1 else false
06:29:54 <Marvin--> emu: depends on how you define correct...
06:32:26 <emu> well
06:32:41 <emu> in a functional language, all that matters is the inputs and the end result
06:33:16 <emu> add1 x = 1 + if true then x else false
06:35:45 <emu> with something like reverse, you could come up with invariants that state that the result of reverse x:xs should be (reverse xs) ++ [x]
06:35:52 <emu> but of course, in a functional language, that's the program =)
06:37:16 <lament> no, that program is not correct
06:37:37 <emu> which ?
06:37:48 <lament> If you divide 64 by 16 by cancelling out the sixes, you get the correct result
06:37:50 <Marvin--> emu: except that you need a base case too
06:37:56 <lament> but that doesn't mean your computation is correct :)
06:38:23 <lament> if you break the type system where it won't affect the program, the program is still not correct
06:38:31 <emu> lament: that's my point
06:38:37 <emu> lament: the program will still execute properly
06:38:48 <emu> but the typesystem prunes it out
06:39:17 <emu> Marvin--: yea yea =)
06:39:21 <lament> yes, just like 64/16 will "execute properly" if you cancel out the sixes
06:39:25 <Marvin--> ./library/libwine.so: odefinierad referens till "h_errno"
06:39:27 * Marvin-- goes "huh"
06:39:27 <emu> Marvin--: i said reverse x:xs
06:39:35 <emu> lament: no, not at all
06:39:58 <emu> lament: following the dynamic semantics, but leaving out the static, you will still get the correct results
06:41:01 <emu> over the same domain as add1 with the type-system, of course
06:41:43 <ibid> lament: your analogy is broken
06:41:57 <ibid> and emu is correct
07:26:52 <shapr> sounds like saying "there are mathematically correct proofs that aren't interesting or useful"
07:27:32 <shapr> my hypothesis is that the type system can be used along the lines of a proof
07:28:07 <shapr> points against: type systems exclude some correct programs
07:28:15 <shapr> is that true of proof systems also?
07:28:22 * shapr doesn't know
07:29:54 <shapr> ibid: I got a win NT error for the url to that paper, what's the title/author/etc of the paper?
07:30:11 * liiwi tackles shapr
07:30:19 * shapr dodges furiously
07:30:25 <shapr> hi liiwi, wassup?
07:30:38 <liiwi> greatfullness!
07:30:53 <shapr> what for?
07:31:26 <liiwi> things just slide on their places
07:31:38 <shapr> sounds nice
07:32:00 <liiwi> and I even get stuff done!
07:32:36 <shapr> wow!
07:36:29 <shapr> random thought... gkrellm should have a facial expression skin
07:38:55 <liiwi> heh
07:39:17 <liiwi> soon we have gkrellm's cursing when load is too high
07:39:24 <shapr> or at least sweating :-)
07:39:35 <shapr> maybe a thoughtful look?
07:39:37 <liiwi> moaning
07:39:52 <emu> shapr: and Marvin-- was pointing out that type-systems aren't powerful enough to `prove' a program correct
07:40:20 <shapr> yah, that's true
07:41:09 <shapr> I think this is part of the Entsheidungsproblem
07:41:12 <shapr> or at least related
07:41:24 <shapr> er Entscheidungsproblem
07:45:58 <emu> I suspect that a system powerful enough to prove a program `correct' would itself require a more powerful system to prove it correct, but I could be wrong.
07:47:22 <emu> a program in any interesting language, anyway
07:58:16 <lament> what's correct?
08:37:02 <shapr> hm, new activity on HaskellWiki
08:37:04 * shapr reads
08:41:44 <Igloo> Did you see the mailing list post about switching wikis?
08:57:01 <shapr> yah, I saw it
08:57:14 <shapr> I've offered to do the conversion to MoinMoin before
08:57:32 <shapr> otoh, o3 is planning to write a WikiWiki in Haskell this year sometime
09:04:24 <liiwi> has very little time left :P
09:06:04 <shapr> has anyone tried QuickCheck in ghc5.04.2 ?
09:06:09 <shapr> something weird going on here
09:06:14 <shapr> might be user error
09:30:30 <shapr> oh, it is user error
10:33:48 <ibid> hm, what's the english word for the one large sheet of paper that the yellow press uses to advertise the hottest headlines of today's paper?
10:34:00 <ibid> or for the headlines on that sheet?
10:37:02 <Igloo> yellow press? Do you mean what paper sellers have as a sort fo advertisment?
10:37:41 <ibid> no
10:38:32 <Igloo> Oh, that's OK - I don't know what to call that anyway  :-)
10:39:00 <ibid> around here, the two major yellow press newspapers are sold in kiosks and stores; they are on a stand, which includes a large (yellow?) sheet of paper shouting today's headlines
10:39:11 <ibid> we call them lööppis
10:39:44 <Igloo> That sounds like what I was trying to describe (although they aren't yellow here)
10:40:11 <ibid> ahh paper sellers
10:40:12 <ibid> yeah
10:40:33 <ibid> mistook that "paper" as meaning paper paper, not newspaper papers :-)
10:40:41 <ibid> i mean, the physical stuff one writes on
10:40:49 <Igloo> Right  :-)
10:41:22 <ibid> i'm just trying to google for some insight on how to write lööppis
10:41:31 <ibid> the finnish word lööppi turned up nothing
10:42:35 <shapr> tabloids?
10:42:42 <shapr> ohh, those sheets
10:43:09 <ibid> mind you, this is for fiction :-)
10:43:27 * ibid is not trying to become a yellow press editor :-)
10:49:35 <ibid> thanks, shapr
10:50:00 <ibid> how to write tabloid headlines turned up some interesting links
14:50:17 * jaredj is away: bathing
15:31:33 * jaredj is back (gone 00:41:16)
15:56:50 * dark jumps around.
15:57:08 <Igloo> Hmmm?
15:57:23 <dark> I'm looking for someone to test the joystick support in hasdl :)
15:57:32 <Igloo> Ah  :-)
16:00:04 --- topic: set to '["mo' nads than you", "We put the Funk in Funktion", "See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/", "Gtk+HS 0.14.10: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/gtk/", "HWS-WP: http://www.dum.chalmers.se/~marvin/hws-wp/", "HaskellWiki resurrected", "ANNOUNCE: GHC version 5.04.2 released","need joystick testing: http://www.xs4all.nl/~dark/hasdl-0.1pre7.tar.gz"]' by dark
16:02:27 <jaredj> somebody asked this on haskell-cafe and i never saw an answer (i was amazed by the low traffic):
16:02:59 <jaredj> once you write all this stuff and it has to be monadic, why be so functional?
16:03:21 <dark> What's "this stuff"?
16:03:21 <jaredj> i'd just keep coding but i've got a lot of monads so far and i'm not sure i'm approaching it right
16:03:36 <jaredj> "this stuff" for me is a playlist type
16:03:43 <lament> monads are functional :)
16:03:52 <jaredj> well... yes. but they're do-ful.
16:04:30 <jaredj> *shrug*
16:04:50 <jaredj> so there's this playlist. and i have these functions to pick random items from the playlist.
16:05:11 <jaredj> random -> using a monad already, and no i/o yet. makes me nervous
16:05:42 <jaredj> because i read that monads are a great thing (i agree) but that the heart of the program should be purely functional
16:06:04 <jaredj> this thing is a server that will keep track of playlists and tell multiple copies of ices what to play next
16:06:07 <Igloo> I tend to try to use the IO monad only in an outer layer
16:06:10 <jaredj> (all via sockets)
16:06:39 <jaredj> so yes. IO in the outer layer, no problem. but i haven't even gotten there and half my functions are monadic. *flail*
16:07:57 <jaredj> i guess it's ok but i grew up on imperative stuff and i wanted to make sure i'm not slipping into that too much.
16:07:58 <whee> it sounds like you're using monads where they really shouldn't be
16:08:31 <jaredj> well, i'm not making any of my own, just using the ones provided by Random,etc.
16:09:13 <whee> right, but the retrieval of the random number should probably be moved closer to main or something
16:13:18 <jaredj> hm
16:13:59 <jaredj> entryFrom :: PlayList -> (Int -> IO Int) -> IO (Maybe Entry)
16:14:39 <jaredj> (the (Int -> IO Int) takes the length and returns a random number between 0 and it.)
16:15:12 <jaredj> i wanted flexibility in how to pick the number
16:15:46 <whee> do you have something that returns the length of the playlist?
16:16:28 <whee> I'm thinking just move that random number up a level so that entryFrom doesn't need to be IO
16:16:55 <whee> and it simply returns the element at some position in the playlist
16:18:20 <jaredj> entryFrom gets the length
16:19:02 <whee> I'm thinking converting that to something like entryAt which simply returns the entry at some position
16:19:11 <jaredj> entryFrom playList pickFn = (pickFn ((length playList) - 1)) >>= \pick -> return (find (\(a,b,c) -> a == pick) playList)
16:19:24 <whee> then another function (which would be IO), would actually handle dealing with the length and the random number and all
16:19:29 <Igloo> Can you pass a RandomGen around instead?
16:19:51 <jaredj> p.. rocessing..
16:19:54 <jaredj> uhh
16:20:56 <jaredj> i wanted the capability to rate things, see
16:21:04 <jaredj> ratings go up when an entry gets requested
16:21:21 <jaredj> i've written this in ruby - that got me way ahead in ruby
16:21:38 <whee> I'm just thinking that some functions are doing too much
16:21:40 <jaredj> now it's old and crufty and half the features never came to be, and it needs rewriting and i want to learn haskell. :)
16:21:43 <jaredj> ok. ic
16:22:06 <jaredj> in ruby the rating was the index in the list; i thought that would be a bad idea in haskell, because the list would have to be changing all the time
16:22:24 <jaredj> (it also wasn't robust in ruby to start with)
16:22:47 <jaredj> hmm.
16:23:18 <whee> perhaps a FiniteMap would be good for the playlist?
16:23:39 <jaredj> mragh
16:24:05 <Igloo> Personally I'd be tempted to look at database bindings
16:24:11 <jaredj> true enough
16:24:25 <jaredj> when i wrote it in ruby i didn't want to require mysql - because everything on freshmeat did :)
16:24:34 * jaredj looks at the FiniteMap
16:26:12 <whee> you could have a function requestEntry :: PlayList -> Int -> PlayList which takes a playlist and an entry number, does whatever with it, and returns a new playlist with the new ratings and such
16:26:24 <jaredj> right, ok
16:26:27 <jaredj> makes sense
16:27:07 <Igloo> Don't you hate it when just before you are about to write something you realise it is blatantly false?
16:27:26 <jaredj> :)
16:27:33 <dark> It's preferable to realizing this just after you write it.
16:27:37 <Igloo> (repeated every 10 mins)
16:27:43 <Igloo> True
16:27:47 <jaredj> true.
16:28:29 * jaredj pronounces the FiniteMap good.
16:33:25 <jaredj> so maybe i could have the Playlist be a (FiniteMap Int Entry)?
16:34:04 <jaredj> from ranking to entry?
16:34:04 <whee> that'd work
16:34:17 <jaredj> ah.
16:34:20 <whee> well, maybe
16:34:27 <whee> heh
16:34:42 <jaredj> if i did that - should i go type Ranking = Int and make it a FiniteMap Ranking Entry?
16:35:19 <whee> that may make things clearer
16:35:30 <jaredj> ...i should just go look at more already-written source
16:36:23 * jaredj downloads hws-wp
16:36:39 <whee> I'm not sure how easy it'd be to maintain a FiniteMap with the keys being rankings
16:39:40 <jaredj> mm... four operations on the FM. :P
16:40:33 <jaredj> maybe define promote and demote for lists?
16:41:03 <whee> maybe you want [(Ranking, Entry)] and something to deal with actually creating that
16:41:14 <whee> I'm assuming there's no duplicate rankings?
16:41:24 <jaredj> no. no duplicate rankings.
16:41:30 <whee> so keep track with basic ratings, then deal with calculating rankings elsewhere
16:41:47 <jaredj> i should have told you what an Entry is: (Int, Piece, Weight)
16:41:53 <jaredj> (the first Int is the ranking)
16:41:59 <whee> ah
16:42:21 <jaredj> whee: you mean like how many requests something got? then have a function to sort descendingly by requests and not care about storage order?
16:42:29 <whee> yeah
16:42:34 <jaredj> that sounds more functional
16:42:36 <whee> sort by requests, then convert those into rankings
16:43:02 <whee> I think you could do the conversion with a list comprehension
16:45:23 <jaredj> well if i'm converting on the fly numerical rankings don't matter so much
16:46:27 <jaredj> i could just make a list (voila, list comprehension)
16:48:20 * Igloo sighs upon realising I have non-determinsitic termination
18:12:27 * jaredj is away: bathing

18:40:58 * jaredj is away: making tea
22:28:14 <hays> What I need is a excellent Haskell tutorial.  YAHT isn't cutting it for me
22:28:29 <hays> and GITH seems to be sorta bleh too.
22:28:35 <hays> Any suggestions?
22:29:10 <hays> I'd like it to focus on the FP paradigm.  I know a little Scheme but don't have much experience with designing algortithms with fold/map/etc
22:36:22 <hays> or this channel is dead
22:36:44 <jaredj> not entirely i just haven't much of a better thing to offer
22:37:00 <jaredj> (just learning myself)
22:37:21 <hays> Hmm..
22:37:23 <jaredj> once i got through GITH i was entirely confused by I/O so i found some papers about monads in general and I/O in specific
22:37:30 <jaredj> they were quite helpful
22:37:41 <hays> I wonder if maybe it would be worth going through Knuth
22:37:56 <hays> and just figuring it all out
22:38:01 <jaredj> for FP? i doubt it; i think the Art of Computer Programming was mostly procedural
22:38:41 <jaredj> people always recommend "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
22:39:01 <jaredj> that book uses and expounds Scheme
22:39:10 <hays> yeah ive read some of that book
22:39:16 <hays> its quite interesting
22:39:27 <jaredj> although i've been told Lisp is originally and at its core imperative, Scheme seems to be much more functional in its focus.
22:39:45 <jaredj> except it's not strictly functional, and Haskell is.
22:40:10 <jaredj> so most of the stuff Scheme does with side-effects (e.g. print), Haskell does with monads.
22:40:10 <hays> most of whats in that book can be applied to haskell
22:40:22 <jaredj> yes
22:40:23 <hays> its largely theoretical
22:40:41 <jaredj> meaning, dealing more with calculation than I/O, i surmise.
22:41:27 <jaredj> done much recursive stuff?
22:41:33 <hays> only some
22:41:44 <hays> certainly more than most people I suppose
22:41:48 <jaredj> :)
22:42:16 <hays> this IBM tutorial is gay
22:42:21 <jaredj> for all of the languages i learned, i had something to write
22:42:25 <jaredj> what, about HaXml?
22:42:28 <jaredj> pppttt.
22:42:36 <jaredj> doesn't teach you squat about haskell.
22:43:04 <jaredj> e.g. scheme, it was a moving app written for the Palm
22:43:25 <jaredj> to label boxes. that got me more acquainted with FP and Scheme
22:43:43 <jaredj> haskell has been a whole new level of FP for me tho
22:44:27 <jaredj> i don't have any great recommendations. do poke about the wiki some though.
22:48:10 <hays> the wiki?
22:49:20 <jaredj> yes, the haskell wiki
22:49:29 <jaredj> ever run across a wiki? they're great
22:50:08 <hays> dont know what a wiki is
22:51:07 <jaredj> ah
22:51:18 <jaredj> the original one is .. i think http://c2.com/wiki
22:51:43 <jaredj> properly named WikiWikiWeb, but most shorten it to wiki
22:52:02 <jaredj> foundation: anyone can edit any page
22:54:30 <hays> hm
22:54:43 <hays> interesting 
22:57:24 <hays> time for bed.  im gonna read this Haskell wiki though.  looks like decent info
22:57:27 <hays> thanks
