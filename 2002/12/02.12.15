00:12:37 <seth> Hello
00:16:03 <Verbophob> So...
00:16:05 <Verbophob> How are you?
00:17:26 <seth> OK, yourself?
00:17:58 <seth> Just figured out why this program works with g++ 3.2 but not with g++ 2.95.
00:18:05 <seth> I hate C++
00:18:29 <Verbophob> Yeah..  The ABI changed, or something to that effect...
00:18:54 <Verbophob> Myself, I've just completed my first halfway decent Haskell program, and am proud of it.
00:18:54 <seth> They "improved" the C++ standard library.
00:19:06 <seth> What does it do?
00:19:19 <Verbophob> Converts xchat logfiles into pretty HTML.
00:19:52 <seth> Interesting.
00:20:01 <Verbophob> Not very... :)
00:22:39 <seth> Converting something to HTML, though, is not trivial, even if this particular translator is just for the experience.
00:24:10 <Verbophob> Well, what I did was, basically, parse the thing line by line, extract the interesting elements, then output some HTML.  Regexes kinda saved my live here.
00:24:13 <Verbophob> life*
01:17:23 * seth is away: Don't say anything until I get back.
02:34:02 <systems> anyone tried GHC version 5.04.2 rpms on redhat 7.3
03:28:19 <ibid> sometimes i really wonder how anybody can speak english as their native language :-)
03:30:12 <lament> hm
03:30:42 <lament> sounds easy - because they've been taught it when they were little? :)
03:31:20 <ibid> but the language is so ... so ... alien!
03:31:21 <ibid> :-)
03:32:11 <lament> All languages are :)
03:32:36 <ibid> not finnish :-)
03:34:05 <lament> Hm, I think some people would disagree with that :)
03:35:09 <ibid> but finnish is natural :-)
03:35:41 <lament> Yes, it comes naturally to all finnish aliens.
03:36:07 <ibid> i didn't know there are any
03:37:15 <lament> I mean all those creatures who don't speak English as their native language :)
03:37:21 <ibid> hehe
03:38:38 <ibid> it seems my relativity processor has not woke yed
03:45:32 <lament> of course, there's only one true language - Hebrew. The rest are merely reflections :)
03:47:37 <ibid> it has been proven that every language is a descendant from finnish
03:47:49 <lament> except Hebrew.
03:48:09 <ibid> no no no
03:48:25 <ibid> before babel, everyone spoke finnish
03:49:21 <lament> heh :)
03:50:17 <ibid> finnish is such a powerful language that its speakers had to be exiled to the final land (finland:-)
03:50:40 <lament> hm, and in what language does finland mean the final land? :)
03:50:55 <ibid> that's its etymology
03:51:03 <ibid> the land at the end of the world
03:51:18 <ibid> remember, the world is a pancake
03:52:02 <lament> oh, seriously?
03:52:14 <ibid> that's what i've been told
03:52:33 <lament> hm
03:52:38 <lament> and who calls finland finland?
03:52:50 <lament> don't the finns call it suomi?
03:53:03 <andersca> yes
03:53:09 <Marvin--> no, they call it sauna, but foreigners get confused by the difference
03:53:19 <andersca> haw haw
03:54:10 <ibid> yeah, i think the name finland come from the romans
03:54:19 <ibid> but i'm not sure
03:54:26 <ibid> certainly it's foreign
03:55:06 <Marvin--> interestingly the sticker on cars say SF for Sumoi - Finland
03:55:16 <Marvin--> yet another result of the Swedish opressors I suppose
03:55:30 <lament> Does 'suomi' mean anything?
03:55:54 <ibid> it does but i'm not sure it's related to the name :-)
03:56:09 <ibid> suomi is past tense for suomia, roughly to whip :-)
03:56:49 <lament> hrm.
03:56:52 <ibid> singular third person past tense actually
03:57:03 <lament> that's a weird name :)
03:59:11 <ibid> yeah
03:59:55 <ibid> actually, suomi is originally the name of a southern corner of the country (now called varsinais-suomi 'proper finland')
04:04:35 <ibid> some suggest that suomi comes from the swamps ("suo") that one could find in finland back when they weren't dried :-)
04:06:20 <ibid> hmm, me learns something about my country
04:06:51 <ibid> there was a king of finns in the fifth century, called sumblus
04:07:00 <ibid> apparently
04:08:04 <lament> with a name like that i'd kill myself... but do go on :)
04:09:41 <ibid> sumblus is apparently the latin form of sumbl (mentioned in swedish pre-sweden history)
04:10:13 <ibid> "which means feast, ale, mead, and is a synonym for Ölvaldi, Ölmóðr, names which belonged to the father of the Ívaldi sons (see No. 123)."
04:11:23 <ibid> islandic history actually
04:12:34 <ibid> but also the list of early swedish kings mention him as the father of a wife of a swedish king
04:14:41 <ibid> but that might be a legend... :-(
04:14:58 <ibid> the same site mentions one king being the grandson of noah
04:15:51 <ibid> "Lindormus. During his reign Julius Caesar came to Scandinavia, but was so terrified by the people here, that he left in a hurry. The Swedish people however didn't forget him and named 25 of December after him (In Swedish: Juldagen)."
04:16:24 <lament> hmm :)
04:17:51 <ibid> http://www.warholm.nu/Earlykings.html
04:20:00 <lament> hm
04:20:08 <lament> sweden seems to have altogether too many kings
04:20:31 <lament> "Erik Weatherhat. Could controll the weather with his hat."
04:21:38 <Marvin--> neat!
04:27:53 <ibid> it seems (according to norse mythology) that old nordic kings prided on being the descendant of the kings of finland and kainuu, the lands of the giants
04:28:06 <ibid> in the viking time, that is
04:29:02 <ibid> of course, the credibility of my sources is close to nil :-)
04:29:50 <lament> hey, i believe you!
04:38:16 <ibid> kainuu is apparently kvenland in english
04:40:46 <ibid> http://www.florilegium.org/files/CULTURES/Finland-hist-art.text
05:47:04 <goulash> hi, i want a function getTime...
05:47:11 <goulash> how can i get that?
05:47:40 <Igloo> See the Time module
08:09:05 * seth is back (gone 06:51:42)
11:06:39 * Igloo wonders if a Haskell printf should take any notice of length modifiers like l and ll
11:08:02 <Heffalump> why shouldn't it?
11:09:07 <Igloo> Well, I would have to pick random integer sizes to use
11:09:40 <Igloo> And you couldn't then printf an Integer, unless I made ll == infinite
11:09:53 <Heffalump> ah.
11:13:48 <xkb> Does haskell have some kind of random function?
11:13:50 <pesco> Igloo: You using Dynamic to pass in the args?
11:13:50 <xkb> like
11:14:07 <xkb> random :: Int -> Int -> Int 
11:14:18 <ibid> xkb: yes, but not like that
11:14:22 <Igloo> pesco: No, using TH
11:14:23 <xkb> ah
11:14:33 <pesco> Igloo: Oh
11:14:36 <Igloo> Are the arguments range bounds?
11:14:36 <xkb> ibid : do u know an URL?
11:14:47 <Igloo> If so you want the Random module
11:14:53 <ibid> xkb: it's in the standard libraries
11:14:59 <Igloo> http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/haskell98-revised/haskell98-report-html/random.html
11:15:36 <xkb> thanks very much :D
11:16:50 <xkb> 2 bad ghc ebuild of gentoo linux still wont build :(
11:19:17 * pesco hides behind a rock
11:20:50 <pesco> xkb: I suppose I could send you my latest local version. No guarantees though, I'm not sure where I left it...
11:21:03 <xkb> that ll be fine
11:21:03 <xkb> :D
11:21:15 <xkb> the problem seems to be gcc 3.2
11:22:06 <pesco> Hm, I think the problem was GHC actually, it's fixed with 5.04.1 or something
11:22:11 <pesco> gimme your email address.
11:22:19 <xkb> sander@hypernation.net
11:24:17 <pesco> xkb: Ok, sent.
11:24:26 <xkb> Thanks. ill have a look
11:24:39 <pesco> Tell me if anything breaks.
11:25:59 <argv[0]> anyone writes code in Literate Haskell using LaTeX? Anyone have a good code environment that doesn't get messed about the backslashs?
11:26:24 <pesco> I code Literate Haskell in ASCII art!
11:27:21 * Igloo wrote http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/Haskell2LaTeX/ for my undergrad project. There are others on haskell.org.
11:28:36 <ibid> is it packaged?
11:28:52 <argv[0]> pesco: :P
11:29:19 <pesco> argv: It's fun, you should try it!
11:33:51 <whee> argv[0]: vim handles literate haskell by just treating anything not starting with > as a comment, so it doesn't even attempt to do anything with the latex code
11:38:24 <argv[0]> whee: vim handles the '>' ok, but its seems that hugs doesn't like much of it... i've errors when using the '@' in haskell code
11:44:47 <whee> weird :|
11:45:11 <whee> is there a literate haskell to html program somewhere?
11:45:49 <Igloo> ibid: Mine isn't packaged for Debian yet, no
11:45:57 <ibid> it should be, if it's useful
11:46:10 * ibid might consider using it for my next lecture notes
11:46:34 <ibid> (advanced studies level introduction to functional programming with haskell.  fun :-)
11:47:01 <Igloo> The output phase isn't wonderful, unfortunately. My supervisor had an idea that might be better, but I don't have time to rewrite it AtM
11:47:41 <Igloo> But it works fine if you avoid things like huge expressions in parentheses
11:49:16 * seth is away: Don't say anything until I get back.
11:49:38 * ibid says something just to spite seth
12:12:30 * Heffalump too
16:52:35 <inkedmn> are there any good functional programming tutorials out there?
16:52:41 <inkedmn> that aren't language specific?
16:52:53 <Pseudonym> Gee, that's a touch one.
16:52:56 <Pseudonym> tough
16:53:23 * inkedmn is wondering if </sarcasm> tag will appear...
16:53:25 <inkedmn> ;)
16:53:25 <Pseudonym> By nature, programming tutorials are hands-on, so my guess would be no..
16:53:48 <inkedmn> yeah, i was kinda thinking the same thing
16:54:03 <Igloo> I'm not really sure what that would mean
16:54:11 <inkedmn> i'm going through the "Yet another haskell tutorial" doc, and i'm not really digging it
16:54:12 <Igloo> You need to pick *some* syntax
16:54:32 <ibid> well, you could do the equivalent of what knuth did
16:54:39 <ibid> and use pure lambda calculus :-)
16:54:43 <inkedmn> i'm looking for an overview of what "functional programming" REALLY is/entails
16:54:50 <inkedmn> heh
16:54:52 <Igloo> That's a language
16:55:03 <Pseudonym> Functional programming in MIX.
16:55:13 <ibid> Igloo: not a programming language
16:55:25 <ibid> Igloo: like MIX is not a programming language
16:55:34 <ibid> Pseudonym: i'd rather do fp in MMIX
16:55:50 <Igloo> Oh, let's not get into this argument  :-)
16:55:51 <Pseudonym> ibid: Good point.  There's probably a natural mapping from TIL to MMIX.
16:55:58 <ibid> TIL?
16:56:04 <Pseudonym> Three Instruction Language
16:56:17 <ibid> ah, you mean 3AC? ;-)
16:56:33 <Pseudonym> Actually, I think I mean TIM.
16:56:39 <ibid> i think the dragon book calls it that
16:57:00 <Pseudonym> No, you're thinking of triples.
16:57:12 <ibid> hmm, /me is really cutting corners with the thesis now
16:57:19 <ibid> well, to have it finished today...
16:57:34 <ibid> Pseudonym: three-address code (that's quadruples:-)
16:57:41 <Pseudonym> Right.
16:57:44 <ibid> ahh yeah
16:57:46 <Pseudonym> TIM is something different.
16:57:48 <ibid> i get the difference
16:57:55 <ibid> three instructions, not addresses :-)
16:58:03 * ibid missed that one
16:58:15 <Pseudonym> TIM is an older abstract machine for lazy functional languages.
16:58:20 <ibid> ok
16:58:44 <Pseudonym> It has a certain cleanliness to it, but it's not very practical, if I recall.
17:34:44 <neniu> ping
17:34:57 <ibid> pong
17:46:06 <Igloo> This code is getting hairier than a very hairy thing
17:49:55 <ibid> if i had another year for this, i could probably finish this...
17:50:07 <ibid> but now i just need to get a version that looks like it's finished :-)
17:50:17 <ibid> (apropos hairy stuff :-)
17:50:36 <clausen> who had to finish that code yesterday?
17:50:42 <clausen> (today?)
17:50:48 <ibid> ?
17:50:54 * clausen mixed up with timezones
17:50:57 <clausen> some master's thesis?
17:51:19 <ibid> i need to get a version that looks like finished to my supervisor today
17:51:26 <ibid> (it's about 4 am here)
17:51:31 <ibid> master's thesis, yes
19:11:13 <inkedmn> anybody home?
19:11:14 <inkedmn> :)
19:12:51 <Pseudonym> Yes and no.
19:13:18 <inkedmn> you're here, but you're not at your residence?
19:13:20 <inkedmn> ;)
19:18:59 <inkedmn> man, i really wish i had the haskell book i'm getting for Xmas NOW...
19:19:12 <lament> wow, haskell book for christmas!
19:20:16 * Pseudonym wishes he had present-givers like that
19:21:32 <Pseudonym> Dear Santa: I've been a good boy all year.  I'd like Knuth's "Concrete Mathematics" and Okasaki's "Purely Functional Data Structures".  Thanks, Pseudonym.
19:22:04 <inkedmn> lament: from my mom :)
19:29:30 <inkedmn> any of you guys know SML?
19:31:31 <inkedmn> bah, n/m
19:33:17 * inkedmn is trying to write the soundedx matching algorithm in haskell...
19:33:21 <inkedmn> gah
19:33:30 <inkedmn> s/soundedx/soundex/g
20:06:15 * seth is back (gone 08:16:58)
