11:02:43 <Syntaxpolice> ibid: I hear you are looking for someone to take over the debian package for haskell-mode.
11:03:10 <Syntaxpolice> hi jmalicki-work.  Learn any Haskell yet?
11:06:00 <jmalicki-work> i already have awhile back :)
11:06:08 <jmalicki-work> i just haven't had time to do real haskell hacking
11:06:11 <jmalicki-work> hopefully soon
11:06:36 <jmalicki-work> i'm getting bored with C
11:26:22 <ibid> Syntaxpolice: yeah
11:27:40 <Syntaxpolice> ibid: I can probably take it over for you.  I've been wanting to do some haskell related packages.
11:28:03 <Syntaxpolice> there are some complex issues with most of them, though, which were discussed on haskell-cafe.
11:28:14 <Syntaxpolice> but haskell-mode could be a good start.
11:29:36 <ibid> okay
11:29:47 <ibid> can you upload soon?
11:32:25 <Syntaxpolice> ibid: I'm not an official maintainer yet.  Walters is sponsoring me.
11:33:43 <ibid> i know
11:33:49 <ibid> i ask again :-)
11:34:46 <Syntaxpolice> I guess I'm not sure what you're asking.  Are you asking if I'll be able to upload on my own soon?
11:36:29 <ibid> no
11:36:51 <ibid> if you are able to make an upload, either through your sponsor or on your own, soon
11:39:25 <Syntaxpolice> yeah.  I can probably spend some time on it this week.  It needs to be updated to 1.44, right?
11:40:06 <ibid> that's your call
11:40:29 <ibid> the important thing for me is, how long it carries my name as the maintainer :-)
11:42:12 <Syntaxpolice> ahh - I could probably do it very soon.  I have the day off tomorrow so maybe then if you want it done that fast.
11:42:16 <Syntaxpolice> are you getting a lot of email about it?
11:44:38 <ibid> not particularly
11:44:46 <ibid> not that package, anyway
11:45:12 <ibid> but i have bad experiences with giving away packages...
11:45:48 <ibid> there is a package i've given away twice, waited for months both times, and it still carried my name after that
11:46:07 <ibid> finally found real maintainers here :-)
11:46:11 <ibid> (you know who you are)
11:48:00 <Syntaxpolice> ibid: OK.  Well, like I said, I could probably do it in a matter of days if that sounds good.
11:50:04 <ibid> a week is ok
11:53:11 <Syntaxpolice> ok cool.
11:56:40 <ibid> Syntaxpolice: go retitle the bug if you haven't already
12:03:17 <Syntaxpolice> ibid: will do.
12:53:07 <ibid> Syntaxpolice: the proper tag is ITA:, not A: (unless they changed stuff without me noticing)
12:53:10 <ibid> but thanks
19:20:47 <dark> I wonder if defining nothing = return () will make for clearer code.
19:21:07 <dark> if cond then bla else nothing, that sort of thing
20:43:47 <dennisb> dark: sounds like "when" in the module Monad
20:43:59 <dennisb> when cond bla
