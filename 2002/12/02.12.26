08:08:44 <inkedmn> merry belated xmas, dark :)
08:11:41 <dark> inkedmn: I'm just glad it's finally over :)
08:13:04 <inkedmn> heh, i understand
23:06:40 <hays> I am doing "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial" and it they use the toUpper function.   However in GHC(i) this function doesn't seem to exist.  There are some other inconsistencies as well.
23:10:06 <hays> my question is does the toUpper function exist?  if so, how do I get it?  If not, how would I implement it (pseudo-elegantly)
