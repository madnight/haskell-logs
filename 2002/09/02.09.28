04:15:21 * Igloo looks impressed as an overlapped pattern warning for "In a case alternative: _ -> ...", and also fails to see why it is being generated
04:21:30 <Igloo> Oh, it's probably cause by everything being explicitly matched too. That's OK then.
10:04:19 <sethk> Hello again, anybody home?
10:17:10 <ibid> hi
10:17:25 <sethk> Ibid:  Hello.  
10:17:57 <sethk> Ibid:  By any chance have you used c2hs with ghci (interactive, that is)?
10:42:22 <ibid> no
10:44:36 <sethk> ibid:  I'm looking for the correct set of "-package" and "-package-info" flags, but I'm not even sure that the combination (c2hs + ghci) is allowable.
10:46:45 <ibid> if it works with ghc, it ought to work with ghci (i think)
10:48:28 <sethk> ibid:  I think that is in general correct, but c2hs only builds static (.a) libraries, and I think you need a .so to use something with ghci.
10:49:00 <sethk> ibid:  I don't see an option for building a shared library with c2hs, but I may be missing something...
10:57:07 <ibid> sethk: can't you hack it?
10:58:03 <sethk> ibid:  Sure.  If it is known not to work, however, I won't expend the effort.  Just lazy   :)
13:58:35 <sethk> Hello Erwin
14:41:49 <sethk> Hello, adept.
14:51:20 <lucijan> hi sethk
14:56:46 <lucijan> ok, no response, will go now...
23:45:18 <toadx> anyone home?
