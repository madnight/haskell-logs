03:45:32 <shapr> tmoertel: hey, Simulator source was released
03:49:12 <smkl> <tmoertel> the icfp contest game server code has been released: http://icfpcontest.cse.ogi.edu/simulator/
03:56:28 <shapr> oh, I see :-)
04:54:39 <cleverdra> Has anyone here successfully compiled GHC 5.04 from the Linux/x86 binary tarball?  I get a haskell-land type error.
04:55:22 <cleverdra> (using GCC 3.1, if that matters)
04:56:32 <Igloo_> I'd suggest trying with 2.95 or whatever the latest in that series is
04:57:57 * shapr bounces
04:58:11 <cleverdra> hm, thanks.
04:58:20 <cleverdra> hello shapr =)
05:00:39 <shapr> hi cleverdra
05:03:48 <cleverdra> oh, also, does anyone know how to convert an Int to a PortNumber (from the Network module)?  Network.Socket has very suspicious functions (like intToPortNumber), but none of them are exported.  Specifically, I want to turn a list of strings (from the commandline) ["6111","6112"] into PortNumbers so I can have concurrent servers in one (unix) process.
05:04:37 <cleverdra> (the problem is 'read'; PortNumber doesn't have a read, and the type system screams if I use Int, and nothing else seems to be able to extract the number from the string)
05:04:37 <Igloo> You have Read and Num instances IIRS
05:04:55 <cleverdra> Igloo - yes; heavens if I can get those to work.
05:05:10 <cleverdra> map (read) args :: (Read a, Num a) => [a]
05:05:11 <shapr> iirc, you're not supposed to use PortNumber directly...
05:05:31 <shapr> I think there's something else that should generate PortNumbers for you
05:06:03 <cleverdra> shapr - the documentation says nothing about this... I'll see if I can find an example somewhere.
05:06:31 <Igloo> Ah, in the ICFP I used fromIntegral
05:06:39 <Igloo> portnum = fromIntegral (read port :: Integer)
05:06:58 <shapr> cleverdra: I saw a post on ghc-users about it recently
05:07:18 <cleverdra> Igloo - cool.  Thanks.
05:11:48 * cleverdra downloads the ghc-users archive.
05:15:57 <Igloo> shapr: The ANNOUNCE and VERSION have been updated for 5.04.1
05:32:21 <shapr> Igloo: cool, so it's out?
05:32:53 <Igloo> NAFAIK
05:32:59 <shapr> ohh
05:33:01 <Igloo> The above meaning the CVS files have been updated
05:33:09 <shapr> I see
06:27:29 * delYsid bounces
06:35:22 * shapr bounces
06:35:26 * shapr writes j2ee code
06:55:40 * tmoertel is back for another day of #haskell fun
07:06:28 <shapr> tmoertel: you get paid to write Haskell don't you?
07:06:43 <tmoertel> I wish!
07:07:00 <tmoertel> I usually write boring stuff like C, C++, XSLT,. . .
07:07:04 <shapr> oh
07:07:19 <tmoertel> although for black-box projects, I can use haskell on internal stuff
07:07:22 <shapr> I'm trying to think of ways to integrate Haskell into my web solutions.
07:07:30 <delYsid> hey, rbird replied!
07:07:37 <delYsid> And it seems he is willing to give it to me!
07:07:47 <shapr> delYsid: wow AWESOME!
07:08:06 <delYsid> yay, let's see...
07:08:18 <delYsid> and I've just sent my first patch to the C code of Emacs
07:19:22 <Heffalump> delYsid: coool.
07:20:23 <delYsid> heh, yeah, now that I signed papers, contributing is easy
07:25:21 <tmoertel> shapr: using haskell in web solutions ought to be possible
07:25:30 <tmoertel> even when your clients don't want haskell code
07:25:48 <tmoertel> you can use haskell to build the stuff you do deliver
07:29:58 <Heffalump> dynamic Haskell module loading would make using Haskell for web programming much nicer
07:31:50 <tmoertel> yes, for programming code that runs live on the web
07:33:15 <Heffalump> I have a dynamic photo publication program written in perl that uses CGI or mod_perl. I'd love to be able to port it to Haskell.
07:33:37 <Heffalump> but I'd need Haskell bindings for ImageMagick and various other utility stuff, too
07:33:44 * tmoertel runs a 5-postman robot battle in background
07:33:49 <jewel> my biggest beef with haskell is that the compilers and runtimes aren't portable enough
07:34:12 <Heffalump> tmoertel: have you plugged your toolkit into the server source code/output yet?
07:34:36 <tmoertel> no, but that's a logical next step
07:34:46 <shapr> Heffalump: the dynamic linking thread on ghc-users might get us to a dynamic runtime loading haskell web server
07:34:52 <tmoertel> right now, I'm recording via proxies
07:34:52 <shapr> jewel:  I don't know how to help you there :-/
07:48:47 <Erwin> Erk. What should I do in the interactive interpreters (ghci, hugs) to define functions? The most basic example on page 1 of Thompson's book gives me a syntax error in the interactive interpreter, but it works fine if put into a .hs file and evaluated by hugs.
07:50:11 <Heffalump> in ghci you can do :
07:50:14 <Heffalump> let f x = x+x
07:50:34 <Heffalump> you can't define functions interactively in hugs and use them afterwards
07:50:56 <Heffalump> so in either you can do "let f x = x+x in f 2", but the next expression you type in won't know anything about f
07:53:02 <Erwin> That seems like a strange limitation. Does the emacs haskell mode has something that makes it easier to interactively try things?
07:56:22 <Heffalump> it's not really strange, it means the interpreter doesn't have to store state from one evaluation to the next
07:56:27 <Heffalump> but like I said, ghci can do it
07:56:36 <Heffalump> I dunno about the emacs haskell mode, sorry
07:56:59 <Muad_UT> how do u actually use any of the libraries included with ghc?
07:57:25 <Heffalump> wdym?
07:58:17 <Erwin> Ah yeah, haskell-hugs-[re]load-file  will evaluate the current .hs file inside an inferior hugs process and go there
08:00:33 <Erwin> The example of calculating fibonacci numbers using an infinite list in the book is beautiful
08:26:10 <delYsid> wooooohoooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
08:26:25 <delYsid> Richard Bird is the best!
08:26:44 <Heffalump> :-)
08:26:45 <delYsid> Introduction to
08:26:45 <delYsid> Functional Programming
08:26:45 <delYsid> using Haskell
08:27:08 <delYsid> Heffalump: If you met him IRL again, tell him I'm really greatful :)
08:27:27 <Heffalump> I'd hope to meet him IRL again, he's my head of department...
08:29:03 <delYsid> I've received so many negative answers to requests like that, it's really a great feeling if one gets a positive one from time to time :)
09:44:07 <specialx> IRL = in real life?
09:44:15 <delYsid> yup
09:44:21 <specialx> cool :)
11:18:53 * tmoertel posts RAVT 0.5 w/ example visualization of 5-way postman battle
14:30:53 <toadx> too bad KDE is not written in haskell :(
14:32:15 <hdaume> hehe
14:34:35 <toadx> I want to add a right-click menu option that says "mount samba share", but only if you are right clicking on a samba share ... it should not be this hard :)
15:03:29 * shapr boings feebly
15:03:41 <shapr> whoa... look, it's Erwin!
15:03:54 <shapr> and dennisb too
15:05:08 <tmoertel> shapr: what's up?
15:05:23 <shapr> me, but not for much longer.
15:05:38 <Erwin> shapr: Heh, I've finally read through Simon's book; Haskell is just the pure functional version of Python :P
15:05:51 <shapr> oh, I remember.. I was going to compile and learn the latest hIDE, in preparation for it becoming scriptable in Haskell.
15:06:00 <shapr> Erwin: it's great to see you here!
15:06:25 <shapr> Erwin: there are one or two minor differences between Haskell and Python, but I like both languages.
15:06:25 <Erwin> shapr: i was most impressed by generating an infinite list of fibonacci numbers: fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
15:06:35 <shapr> yah, that's a cute trick.
15:06:40 <shapr> there's more cool stuff though.
15:06:59 <Erwin> I hope my programs will never have to do any I/O, hehe.
15:07:18 <shapr> the Thompson book just scratches the surface of the coolness of Haskell.
15:08:27 <shapr> Erwin: have you written anything in Haskell yet?
15:08:52 <Erwin> The pure FPness of Haskell makes it a more interesting language than LISP. I've also gone through the SML book once, but Haskell just looks better, or the Haskell book I have is better than the "ML for the working programmer"
15:08:57 <shapr> Erwin: I/O is only difficult at first, afterwards a bit of mental reorganization it's easy.
15:09:10 <Erwin> shapr: I'll go back and actually do the exercises now :)
15:09:14 <shapr> oh, I haven't seen ML for the WP, is it any good?
15:09:46 <Erwin> It didn't make me want to play with ML very much, unlike Simon's book did for Haskell.
15:10:25 <Erwin> Hmm, custom created operators can include Unicode symbols... :)
15:10:44 <shapr> I recently purchased http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/Algorithms-functional.html
15:10:50 <shapr> I'm having a blast going through that book.
15:11:51 <Erwin> Exactly 2^8 pages?
15:12:26 <shapr> Erwin: head (filter (>5) [6..]) doesn't calculate the second element..
15:12:35 <shapr> I found that hard to adjust to since I'm used to filter having to finish in Python
15:13:25 <Erwin> Anyway, yeah, I think you can get a better understanding of algorithms when using a functional language to implement them. I could only vaguely remember how various sorting algorithms really worked until I saw the 3 line impl of each in Haskell
15:15:55 <shapr> I enjoyed reading this: http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
15:16:41 <Erwin> Heh.
15:17:34 <shapr> the different strategies employed were fascinating...
15:21:06 <shapr> not that I understand all of them..
15:21:10 <shapr> what the heck are comonads?
15:28:43 <shapr> has anyone else here tried to compile hIDE?
15:30:25 <tmoertel> not me, sorry
15:31:15 * shapr figures out a package name is missing
15:38:10 <shapr> so, what's everybody working on?
15:38:23 <shapr> anyone writing Haskell code?
15:38:44 <toadx> i was writing haskell code last week, this week I am writing C++
15:38:47 <redcrosse> partial application here...
15:39:01 <redcrosse> the concept anyway
15:39:19 <shapr> toadx: what were you writing?
15:39:22 <shapr> redcrosse: have you got it figured out?
15:39:30 <redcrosse> think so
15:40:53 <toadx> shapr: a program that creates a sorted XML document of supported  printers based on the contents of a bunch of other XML and plain-text documents
15:41:13 <shapr> sounds useful.
15:41:21 <toadx> the XML lists the printers alphabetically by make and model
15:41:28 <shapr> I don't think I've written any useful Haskell code yet.
15:41:54 <tmoertel> shapr: you could write a ICFP game server log -> RAVT Game translator ;-)
15:42:04 <toadx> I am also working a synth, but that is much slower going
15:42:10 <tmoertel> that would be useful to me ;-)
15:42:45 <shapr> hm
15:43:05 <tmoertel> actually, I'm not sure that there is enough information in a log
15:43:24 --- topic: set to 'ICFP 2002 Robot Analysis and Visualization Toolkit 0.5 http://tea.moertel.com/~thor/ravt/ || We put the Funk in Funktion || See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/ || parr 0.2.3 released http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/nepal/' by shapr
15:44:30 <shapr> tmoertel: I don't know either.
15:45:45 * tmoertel looks at a log
15:46:11 <tmoertel> shapr: I don't think there is.  The server must be modified to output all of the info.
15:47:09 <tmoertel> I put a visualization of a 5-bot (all postman bots) in examples/
15:47:16 <shapr> hm
15:47:21 <tmoertel> s/5-bot/5-bot battle/
15:48:39 * tmoertel watches network lights blink
15:48:46 <shapr> =)
15:49:13 <Erwin> Opera crashes. Again.
15:49:33 <shapr> nice colored maps, but how do I see them slowly?
15:49:51 <tmoertel> did you try the perl one-liner?
15:49:53 * shapr reads the README
15:49:55 <shapr> nope, not yet
15:50:23 <tmoertel> basically:  perl -pe'sleep 1 if /^\f/' thegame.txt
15:50:27 <shapr> oh, I see
15:51:10 <shapr> oh, that's coool!
15:51:26 <tmoertel> the corridor in the crosses map is a major bottleneck
15:51:40 <tmoertel> I see that some teams built congestion-avoidance logic into their bots
15:52:00 <shapr> yah, Igloo put BackOff mode into Postman
15:52:22 <tmoertel> are other robots included in wayfinding?
15:52:36 <shapr> no
15:52:51 <shapr> it was discussed, but we decided it was too variable
15:52:58 <tmoertel> ah
15:53:53 <shapr> bot E got flushed
15:54:06 <shapr> that's nifty
15:54:09 <tmoertel> yep, he's in the drink for sure
15:54:57 <Igloo> pesco (IIRC) did lots of the backoff stuff too
15:56:05 <shapr> icfp was lots of fun
15:56:17 <shapr> next year I hope to know enough Haskell to contribute more code.
15:56:43 <shapr> I'm not yet fluent.
15:57:29 <tmoertel> I must keep using Haskell.  If I leave it for a few months I get rusty.
15:58:18 <shapr> I wonder if it's possible to arrange multi-person weekend irc Haskell projects.
15:58:48 <tmoertel> probably.  all it would take is a little evangelism and organization
15:59:00 <tmoertel> (not that I'm good at either of those things)
15:59:07 <shapr> I can do evangelism.
15:59:28 <shapr> I suck at organization.
16:00:08 <tmoertel> well, we're halfway there!
16:00:19 * shapr grins
16:00:35 <shapr> well, we'd need the same resources that the ICFP team used
16:00:54 <shapr> 'net accessible cvs, and mailing list
16:01:07 <shapr> and organization
16:02:35 <tmoertel> I have some servers.  I might be able to put an extra one up for team use.
16:03:03 <shapr> that would be very helpful
16:04:06 <shapr> the organization part would require some sort of overarching plan, and a list of small bite-size chunks that could be tackled by one or two people in an evening, or by several people in a weekend.
16:04:47 <tmoertel> yes. and a team site to keep track of everything
16:04:50 <shapr> right
16:06:14 * shapr thinks
16:06:21 <jadrian> hello
16:06:25 <tmoertel> hi
16:06:26 <shapr> hi jadrian, what's up?
16:06:26 <jadrian> hi Heffalump 
16:06:32 <jadrian> hi tmoertel, shapr
16:06:42 <shapr> jadrian: bah, you talk to the chanops first :-)
16:06:54 <jadrian> shapr: lol
16:07:08 <jadrian> I'm looking at ghc libraries
16:07:11 <jadrian> State stuff
16:07:14 <tmoertel> ah
16:07:25 <shapr> the best overarching plan I could think of would be to fill in some libraries
16:07:39 <shapr> tmoertel: can you think of other overarching plans?
16:07:51 <jadrian> I've used ST monad and STRefs a couple of times, I just noticed that State Monad was also added
16:07:59 <jadrian> do you know anything about it
16:08:06 <jadrian> how efficient is it...?
16:08:09 <tmoertel> shapr: I think good libraries would be perfect.
16:08:23 <tmoertel> I don't know about efficiency, but I have used the State monad.
16:08:34 <shapr> I wish the Haskell Wish List were still up.
16:08:50 <tmoertel> jadrian: see, e.g., http://tea.moertel.com/~thor/ravt/ravt-0.5/Eval.hs
16:09:12 <jadrian> tmoertel: checking
16:09:28 <tmoertel> shapr: we could port everything on CPAN to Haskell.
16:10:07 <jadrian> this state monad, right tmoertel http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/ghc/docs/latest/html/base/Control.Monad.State.html
16:10:39 <jadrian> yeap it is...
16:10:39 <shapr> tmoertel: good idea
16:10:41 <jadrian> let me see
16:10:51 <jadrian> CPAN what's that
16:10:56 * jadrian only knows CTAN
16:11:03 <tmoertel> Comprhensive Perl Archive Network
16:11:47 <jadrian> ah
16:12:45 <jadrian> tmoertel: ICFP constest?
16:12:49 <jadrian> contest
16:13:08 <tmoertel> jadrian: yes, but it's not code for a robot
16:13:17 <tmoertel> see http://tea.moertel.com/~thor/ravt/ for an explanation
16:15:13 <tmoertel> shapr: another option is to do things that other language platforms don't provide
16:15:25 <tmoertel> rather than porting we could do entirely new stuff
16:18:06 <shapr> I like that idea.
16:18:47 <shapr> I'd still like to have SMTP support of course... but an smtp library wouldn't attract people in droves.
16:18:58 <shapr> hi Xoltar
16:19:05 <Xoltar> Hi there!
16:19:14 <shapr> what's up?
16:19:24 <Xoltar> Not a lot. You?
16:19:42 <shapr> thinking about World Domination using Haskell.
16:19:46 <jadrian> hi Xoltar
16:20:06 <Xoltar> Nice. Hi jadrian.
16:20:28 <shapr> tmoertel: no other language I've seen has QuickCheck...
16:20:39 <jadrian> I think I'll try to understand both ST and State Monads first, and then think aboutWorld Domination using Haskell. 
16:20:42 <tmoertel> true, indeed!  and QC rocks
16:20:46 <shapr> the new version of QC will be even spiffier.
16:21:15 <shapr> Heffalump suggested that QC could save failing test cases as cases to be always tried in the future.
16:21:26 <shapr> that would give QC some flavor of the xUnit framework
16:21:41 <jadrian> Still have some trouble understanding which one is more appropriate to which kind fo siutuations :(
16:21:53 <tmoertel> shapr: that sounds like RegressionCheck
16:21:56 <shapr> and the new QC paper seems to say that QC can do Design By Contract also (among other things)
16:21:56 <jadrian> shapr: that would be nice :)
16:23:21 <shapr> hm, RegressionCheck....
16:23:45 * shapr sends email to John Hughes
16:36:11 * tmoertel could use a cup of tea . . .
16:36:17 <shapr> I like this idea.
16:36:28 <shapr> World Domination, plus cup of tea :-)
16:36:47 <tmoertel> yes, it's a more civilised kind of world domination
16:36:52 * shapr laughs
16:37:13 <shapr> ok, I'll start evangelizing.
16:37:39 <tmoertel> okay. I'll start thinking about server logistics.
16:37:42 <shapr> yay!
16:38:57 <tmoertel> now it's time for that tea!
16:39:04 * tmoertel goes to get some tea
16:43:02 <shapr> tmoertel: http://haskell.org/wiki/wiki?HaskellWorldDomination
16:46:02 <Xoltar> Ah, not just idle talk this time! What if, in addition to porting this stuff, we start with interfaces to the languages that already have the libraries?
16:46:40 <shapr> there's the JVM bridge...
16:46:55 <Xoltar> If we establish a nice Haskell-friendly interface for the module, it can start out as call-throughs to the other language, and gradually be replaced with Haskell as things are ported.
16:47:14 <shapr> good idea
16:47:21 <Xoltar> That's a start, but one of them is only one way, and the other only works on Linux.
16:47:41 <shapr> hmm
16:47:44 <Xoltar> If you're interested in CPAN, maybe a Perl interface is the place to start?
16:47:58 <shapr> well, I'm interested in libraries...
16:48:15 <shapr> I haven't written any Perl in many years, I much prefer Python.
16:48:27 <shapr> not saying Perl is not a good language, just not good for me :-)
16:48:30 * tmoertel is back, cup of tea in hand
16:48:39 <Xoltar> Ditto. I'm trying to work out such an interface for Python myself, at the moment. :-)
16:50:26 <tmoertel> shapr: CPAN is insanely large, I was joking about porting it all.
16:51:39 <tmoertel> a perl-to-haskell bridge, however, would be nice.
16:53:03 <shapr> Python is rumored to be easy to embed into C program, so that could work there.
16:54:25 <shapr> common libs like smtplib would probably be small enough chunks to port in a weekend if you have three or so people working on it.
16:54:44 * shapr wonders if his time estimate is off there
16:55:35 <Xoltar> Right. And that's really where it needs to start - there are so many little libraries that Haskell doesn't have. For smtplib, you'd need rfc 2822 or whatever it is, plus base64, etc, etc.
16:55:52 <shapr> good point
16:55:52 * tmoertel has written base64 libs
16:57:21 <shapr> http://haskell.org/wiki/wiki?HaskellWorldDomination
16:57:26 <tmoertel> and then there's the holy grail: a great GUI abstraction, fully implemented
16:58:02 <shapr> yah, that would be nice.
16:58:11 <tmoertel> btw, anybody know how is Fruit coming along?
16:59:01 <Xoltar> That sure would be nice. Anybody spent any time looking at ObjectIO?
16:59:02 * shapr doesn't know
16:59:18 <shapr> I haven't looked at it, just heard that it's great.
16:59:26 <tmoertel> Xoltar: not me. got a url?
16:59:50 <toadx> I have used ObjectIO under Clean but not haskell
17:00:05 <tmoertel> Google sez: http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/ObjectIO/
17:01:23 <Xoltar> It ships with GHC-5.04 on windows. There's Gtk-based version coming soon for Linux, or so I'm told.
17:01:29 <tmoertel> What!? No Linux version yet!
17:01:37 * tmoertel shudders
17:02:07 <jadrian> back
17:02:20 <clausen> aeee
17:02:25 <jadrian> ty ty ty
17:02:33 <clausen> ty?
17:02:43 <Xoltar> Since it ships with GHC, I'm assuming it's poised to become the GUI toolkit of choice for Haskell. Dunno for sure, though.
17:02:55 <jadrian> oh I thought it was something like "AEEEEE! He's back"
17:03:05 <jadrian> a cream of joy...
17:03:12 <jadrian> guess it was not...
17:03:14 <clausen> aeee == .br slang
17:03:26 <jadrian> which one Xoltar?
17:03:34 <jadrian> ah
17:03:43 <clausen> (aeee = aí = tudo blz aí?)
17:03:57 <jadrian> ah :)
17:04:03 * tmoertel browses ObjectIO sources in CVS
17:04:23 <Xoltar> jadrian: ObjectIO.
17:04:46 <jadrian> Oh, haven't tried it yet, but I was browsing some documentation some time ago
17:05:28 <jadrian> can we have something like external STRefs?
17:05:34 <jadrian> that is...
17:06:29 <jadrian> I wanted to have something like   foo:: c->c->ST s a 
17:06:51 <jadrian> and I wanted to access to STref in taht function...
17:07:00 <jadrian> but without passing it as an argument
17:07:38 <shapr> tmoertel: are you up for a base64 lib next weekend?
17:08:05 <jadrian> opss bbl
17:08:20 <shapr> http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/warrickg/haskell/http/#base64
17:08:20 <shapr> oh
17:08:23 <shapr> neato
17:08:26 <tmoertel> shapr: I don't know yet.  (My calendar isn't set that far in advance.)
17:08:48 * tmoertel checks base64 link
17:10:17 * tmoertel thinks it looks pretty good
17:15:15 <jlk> tmoertel, can you send that emacs color scheme to me ie. blue background?
17:15:34 <tmoertel> jlk: I don't think it's mine.  shapr?
17:16:04 <shapr> jlk: http://purl.org/wiki/emacs/ColorTheme
17:16:07 <jlk> oh.
17:16:12 <jlk> it's shapr's.
17:16:25 <jlk> thank you shapr.
17:16:33 * shapr thinks being confused with tmoertel is cool
17:17:15 <tmoertel> (shapr wouldn't if he saw my taxes!) ;-)
17:17:36 * shapr grins
17:17:53 <shapr> I'm paying 45% taxes. Can you beat that? :-)
17:18:20 <tmoertel> on second thought, maybe I'll keep my taxes...  (45% ouch!)
17:19:02 * tmoertel checks my base64 library
17:19:02 <shapr> and I'm moving to a country with higher taxes.
17:19:38 <tmoertel> shapr: > 50 % ?
17:20:18 <shapr> I'm not sure exactly how much, but I do know that in general sweden has higher taxes than finland.
17:20:49 <tmoertel> sweden also has the highest per-capita coffee consumption in the world
17:20:58 <jlk> where is a place that doesn't have cars and traffic?
17:21:00 <shapr> Some famous swedish author wrote a story about her experience trying to pay 110% taxes.
17:21:15 <jlk> one suitable for developers... :)
17:21:26 <shapr> happily, sweden has since had a tax reform...
17:21:34 <tmoertel> jlk: rural pennsylvania, for one
17:21:38 <shapr> tmoertel: wow, I'll fit right in...
17:21:54 <jlk> it takes me 1 hr 30 minutes each way to work..30 minutes of traffic.
17:22:08 <shapr> jlk: Northern Finland
17:22:18 <shapr> fifteen minutes walk or five minutes by bike to work.
17:22:25 <shapr> but most days I just stay home and ssh in
17:22:39 <tmoertel> I have an office in my house, so my commute is about six seconds, each way.
17:22:47 <shapr> wow, six seconds.
17:22:48 <jlk> nice.. I only know english though.
17:23:00 <shapr> tmoertel: your office is closer to your bedroom than mine is.
17:23:07 <jlk> I have an office too. Thinking about asking to work from home.
17:23:13 * shapr thinks of ways of cutting those extra four seconds off of his commute.
17:23:25 <jlk> I spent all week teaching myself a language called c#.
17:23:34 <jlk> because all my c bugs were done.
17:23:37 <jlk> :(
17:23:47 <shapr> isn't that D Flat language?
17:24:05 <jlk> Is there anything worse then being underworked?
17:24:15 <shapr> jlk: not having a computer?
17:24:36 <jlk> shapr. :)
17:24:50 <jlk> Since 12, i barely know what that is like.
17:25:15 <shapr> two more days of j2ee code for me, then two solid weeks of Zope work.
17:25:40 <tmoertel> out of the coffee cup and into the snake!
17:25:45 * shapr grins
17:25:53 <jlk> shapr, don't you just abhor languages without type inferences?
17:26:19 <shapr> jlk: not really, but I do like type inferencing.
17:26:21 <jlk> tmoertel, huh?
17:26:41 <tmoertel> jlk: java -> coffee cup.  zope -> python -> snake
17:26:49 <jlk> oh. a ha.
17:26:53 <jlk> :)
17:27:00 <tmoertel> if you think that joke was bad, you should have seen my Vegas tour
17:27:44 * shapr snickers
17:27:59 <jlk> rural pennsylvania is ok for developers? or just little traffic?
17:28:10 <shapr> sadly, I have to go to sleep rather than listen to more of the Tour.
17:28:12 <jlk> I work very close to nyc.
17:28:15 <jlk> i hate it.
17:28:25 <jlk> bye shapr.
17:28:26 <tmoertel> rural PA is trees
17:28:33 <tmoertel> g'night, shapr
17:28:38 <Xoltar> Night, shapr
17:28:47 <shapr> g'night everybody
17:29:02 <jlk> just as I was going to ask about finland? :(
17:29:08 <jlk> s/?/.
17:29:44 <tmoertel> jlk: the pittsburgh region is actually quite nice
17:30:18 <jlk> If my job won't let me work from home. I think I'll start writing some shareware programs.
17:30:31 <jlk> tmoertel, oh be real.
17:30:33 <jlk> lol
17:30:33 <jlk> .
17:30:50 <tmoertel> ;-)
17:30:53 <jlk> wait.. i'm tired. :(
17:31:13 <jlk> I mistook pittsburgh for detroit cleveland.
17:31:16 <jlk> hahaha.
17:31:38 <tmoertel> no, I'm talking about the *other* pittsburgh.
17:31:55 <jlk> oh.
17:32:30 <jlk> I just have to get a job where the people *like* me to program.
17:32:41 <jlk> Is this a common thing?
17:33:12 <jlk> It seems everyone else in my work was busy this week except for me.
17:33:28 <jlk> Or rather... busy on *work*.
17:34:12 <jlk> oh well, you not here.
17:34:32 <jlk> Is this room all bots?
17:34:42 <tmoertel> nope, I'm analog
17:35:54 <jlk> I'll look for online classifieds for that area.
17:36:00 <jlk> thanks tmoertel.
17:36:11 <jlk> how long have you been 'haskelling'?
17:36:18 <tmoertel> 'bout 2 years
17:36:25 <tmoertel> jlk: http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/
17:36:29 <jlk> I just got back into it two days ago. :)
17:36:38 <jlk> Are you there?
17:36:47 <tmoertel> yup, I'm in Pgh
17:37:05 <jlk> you like it? My cousins are there.
17:37:10 <tmoertel> it's going to make going to this year's ICFP easy.
17:37:40 <tmoertel> I came here in '92, thinking I would stay for a year or so, but I liked it more than I expected.  I'm still here.
17:37:43 <jlk> I might go.
17:38:22 <jlk> I lived in san diego for 7 years. I like it alot.
17:38:29 <jlk> But the traffic was getting worse.
17:38:40 <jlk> I miss surfing.
17:38:45 <Xoltar> Any of you guys get to use Haskell in your work?
17:39:12 <tmoertel> I use it when I can, mostly for projects were I can deliver something I can build w/ Haskell.
17:39:19 <jlk> Xoltar, someday hopefully.
17:39:31 <tmoertel> But I can't give a client a Haskell program because they wouldn't be able to maintain it.
17:39:54 <Xoltar> Sure.
17:39:55 <jlk> Is the runtime this unmaintainable?
17:39:55 <tmoertel> "foldr? what the heck is that?!?!"
17:40:11 <tmoertel> jlk: it's nothing like that.
17:40:15 <Xoltar> Heh.
17:40:33 <jlk> How come you can't entrust it into visual-shield?
17:41:22 <tmoertel> jlk: I'm talking about the source.  Most clients won't pay for a system unless they get the souce.
17:41:33 <jlk> oh.
17:41:35 <tmoertel> And very few industry programmers know much about FP let alone Haskell.
17:41:37 <Xoltar> I was thinking the other day: the financial places (wall street, etc.) seem to get some amount of use out of *really* hard to read languages like J and K. Wonder if they'd be willing to look at Haskell source.
17:41:44 <jlk> that's news to me.
17:41:59 <jlk> alot of customers I talk too do not care about such things.
17:42:14 <jlk> just support...
17:42:16 <tmoertel> Xoltar: Yes.  In the financial world, "different" is often interpreted as "potentially better than what everybody else is doing."
17:43:03 <jlk> financial world is difficult to incoporate something new. :(
17:43:29 <jlk> It's like virtual oil or something.
17:43:51 <tmoertel> jlk: depends on the sector.  technical analysists are into new tools
17:44:28 <jlk> It's a big field for sure.
17:45:23 <jlk> In non-profits financials,they care about results and windows. :)
17:46:22 <tmoertel> One application in finance that I know of is in SPJ et al.'s "Composing contracts: an adventure in financial engineering." http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/Papers/contracts-icfp.htm
17:46:36 <tmoertel> It's very cool.
17:46:50 <Xoltar> Right. Anything else being done along those lines that you know of?
17:47:13 <tmoertel> I bet that a lot is happening that isn't publicized.
17:47:39 <jlk> Which things will be nice on this years IFCP?
17:47:50 <tmoertel> the Haskell workshop, for starters
17:47:59 <jlk> tmoertel, i agree.
17:48:30 <jlk> tmoertel, yeah but aren't you a pro?
17:48:34 <jlk> :)
17:48:57 <tmoertel> I'm in industry, if that's what you're asking.
17:49:23 * tmoertel looks at list of accepted papers
17:49:42 <jlk> I'm just trying to find the reason to go 400 miles. 
17:49:45 <tmoertel> "Monads for Incremental Computing", "Packrat Parsing: Simply, powerful, lazy, linear time" sound good.
17:49:50 <jlk> Maybe to see the area I guess.
17:50:08 <tmoertel> "exception analysis for non-strict languages"
17:50:18 <jlk> Is this all over the weekdend? :)
17:50:29 <tmoertel> friday--sunday
17:51:04 <tmoertel> "composing monads using coproducts"
17:51:26 <jlk> Can you bring cam-corders?
17:51:31 <tmoertel> "there and back again" (anything w/ a JRRT ref gets my vote) ;-)
17:52:05 <tmoertel> jlk: I don't know.
17:52:11 <jlk> oh.
17:52:54 <jlk> have to go.
17:53:03 <jlk> must get z.
17:53:10 <tmoertel> g'night
17:53:14 <jlk> bye tmoertel, xoltar.
17:53:19 <jlk> talk to you later.
17:53:39 * tmoertel goes to get some tea . . .
17:54:23 <Xoltar> Time for me to call it a night. G'night, all.
