02:52:00 <|Fo|Ns> hi
03:04:50 * shapr pokes hornby
03:09:26 <shapr> hi jewel!
03:51:44 * shapr bounces
06:06:23 * shapr bounces
08:05:33 * shapr boings
08:05:51 * Igloo bounces
08:06:56 <shapr> hi Igloo!
08:07:00 <shapr> how ar ya?
08:07:18 * shapr builds ghc-5.04
08:21:46 <Igloo> OK, thanks  :-)  You?
08:26:44 <shapr> I'm doing well
08:28:03 <shapr> can I build an i686 specific ghc?
08:28:16 * shapr reads config.mk
08:28:57 <Igloo> You could pass the appropriate options to gcc (or rather tell GHC to do so). Can't see why that should break.
08:29:18 <Igloo> Oh, might confuse the mangler, actually. Haven't looked at it though
08:29:23 <shapr> HOSTPLATFORM			= i386-unknown-linux
08:29:35 <shapr> can I change that to something else and all will work?
08:29:46 <shapr> hi hornby!
08:29:50 <hornby> yo :)
08:29:59 <hornby> Any luck with that bug?
08:30:01 <shapr> I'd be especially happy if I could take advantage of the MP spiffiness of my Athlons
08:30:06 <shapr> I've been workin
08:30:07 * Igloo isn't familiar enough with the build system to know
08:30:28 <hornby> shapr: you meen drinking beer with your boss? :)
08:30:32 <shapr> well,
08:30:39 <shapr> beer drinking went from 8:30pm to 1am
08:30:50 <shapr> then sleep
08:31:02 <shapr> beer + code = bugs
08:31:40 <hornby> yup
08:31:53 <shapr> today is a Zope day, then later it's a haskell day.
08:32:12 <shapr> but I figured I'd get ghc-5.04 building in the background
08:32:17 <hornby> :)
08:32:52 <Igloo> OK, I'm slow. I just realised I could infer from earlier than 5.04 has been released  :-)
08:33:01 <shapr> there's also the channel topic.
08:34:43 <Igloo> My brain is practically going backwards
09:42:23 * shapr bounces
11:02:37 <shapr> interesting discussion of clean versus haskell on comp.lang.functional
11:27:23 <shapr> is it possible to create a list that contains itself as an item in haskell?
11:45:14 <smkl> no, it would have type [a] = a
11:45:40 <shapr> thanks
11:47:20 <shapr> any way I could emulate that behaviour?
11:51:44 <smkl> you can have stuff like data Z = Z [Z]
11:51:55 <shapr> ohh
11:51:56 <smkl> and then x = [Z x]
11:52:12 * shapr 's brain twists into weird directions
11:54:44 * shapr thinks about that
11:56:55 <shapr> can I generate new data statements at runtime?
11:57:17 <shapr> I'm trying to un-serialized Python lists as Haskell lists
11:57:36 <shapr> a Python list can refer to itself any number of times
11:59:15 <smkl> of course not. data statement declares a new static type
11:59:30 <shapr> I suspected as much.
12:09:59 <smkl> if you had type "data S a = Self | Elem a" and "data E a = E a | L [E a]" then you could have "conv x [] = []; conv x (Self:tl) = L x : conv x tl; conv x (Elem a:tl) = E a : conv x tl; convert x = y where y = conv y x"
12:34:10 <creichen_> Hi! Does anyone here happen to know what the '-split-objs' option does to ghc?
12:34:30 <shapr> not off the top of my head
12:34:36 <shapr> have you checked the user guide?
12:35:11 <creichen_> I only had a quick glance at it, will have a closer look.
12:35:23 <shapr> Tell the linker to split the single object file that would normally be generated into multiple object files, one per top-level Haskell function or type in the module. We use this feature for building GHC's libraries libraries (warning: don't use it unless you know what you're doing!).
12:36:18 <creichen_> Thanks! Where did you find that?
12:36:41 <shapr> I ran "fgrep -r split-obj *" in the ghc5 html docs dir
12:36:42 <creichen_> The user's guide's explanation is quite a bit shorter (at least the one I found just now...)
12:48:18 <creichen_> Hmm... looks like I'll need that to build libraries. It seems to be clashing with '-unreg' (which I'm supposed to use instead of '-funregisterised' and '-fno-asm-mangling').
12:48:32 <creichen_> Any idea how unregisterised libraries are built, then?
12:51:12 <shapr> not me
12:51:30 <shapr> if it's not it the ghc5 docs, I'd suggest asking on the ghc users list
12:56:58 <creichen_> That sounds like a good idea.
12:57:09 <creichen_> Is there some way to search the ML archives?
12:57:35 <creichen_> (short of doing a mass-wget-with-gunzip and grepping through it)?
13:00:38 <shapr> not that I know of
13:00:42 <shapr> would be sensible though
13:01:28 <creichen_> OK. Thanks anyway!
13:06:17 <hornby> shapr: should I learn Java?
13:09:14 <shapr> hornby: java is profitable
13:09:33 <shapr> hornby: the libraries are decent if schizophrenic
13:09:49 <shapr> hornby: the jvm is about average
13:09:53 <shapr> the syntax is horrendously bad
13:11:00 <hornby> Won't cause permanent brain damage though? 
13:16:12 <creichen_> It's clumsy, but turing-complete. They have higher-order functions now and they intend to introduce type paramters soon, so it might become useful one day.
13:16:48 <creichen_> hornby: shapr's right wrt java being profitable, though. If you want to program for money, you can do worse (VB, Perl...).
13:17:15 <hornby> creichen_: Java is the most palatable of the three.
13:17:45 * creichen_ agrees there
13:18:24 <Igloo> Does Java have higher order functions as opposed to classes with which you can implement them with a large portion of verbiage?
13:18:53 <Igloo> Oh, missed the "now". Guess it does then
13:18:57 <creichen_> Regardint your other question: I've used Java in the last two projects I've worked on and I'm afraid that I can tell from my own experience that it _does_ cause brain damage.
13:19:39 <creichen_> Igloo: They have 'anonymous classes', which reduce the amount of verbiage you need.
13:20:03 <creichen_> Lacking type parameters, it's hard to write something really useful this way, but it's an improvement over earlier Java.
13:20:25 <Igloo> Ah, anonymouse classes hav been in there since I learnt it
13:21:04 <shapr> they've added new stuff in 1.4
13:21:05 <shapr> it has map now
13:21:55 <shapr> I started using java when it was in beta
13:24:01 <hornby> hrm
13:24:24 <hornby> I think I have an issue with Java. I think I need to learn it and exorcize my deamons. 
13:25:58 * hornby never got the whole jdk, sdk, se, ee, me, jre, etc. 
13:28:52 <shapr> it's not very demanding
13:29:06 <shapr> the syntax is simple, if incredibly verbose
13:36:49 <hornby> oh god. my hello world program exploded
