00:29:13 * Pseudonym has a couple of ideas
00:30:00 <Pseudonym> How about some kind of alpha-beta search with time limit?
00:30:30 <Pseudonym> You find the best solution you can withint a certain real-time constraint.
00:32:28 <Pseudonym> Anyway, for those not on the list yet: http://alicorna.net/mailman/listinfo/icfp-team
01:14:27 <shapr> y0 clausen
01:14:44 <shapr> still doing the minimalist look?
02:56:20 <shapr> hi silentdea
02:56:43 <shapr> silentdea: are you learning Haskell? or a long-time user?
02:56:53 <silentdea> learning
02:57:04 <silentdea> well, just starting now :)
02:57:06 <shapr> looking for some good stuff to read?
02:57:13 <silentdea> bored so i thought i might try a different language
02:57:17 <shapr> have any questions I might be able to help you with?
02:57:21 <silentdea> um
02:57:27 <shapr> that's why I started to learn Haskell
02:57:33 <shapr> I was looking for something to expand my thinking.
02:57:46 <silentdea> it seems realyl interesting, being purely functional and all.
02:57:52 <silentdea> what kind of programs have you written with it?
02:57:54 <shapr> yah, I think so too
02:57:56 <shapr> not much so far
02:58:01 <shapr> I wrote a fractal text grapher
02:58:07 <shapr> not very exciting, but nifty :-0
02:58:11 <shapr> er ":-)"
02:58:24 <shapr> and I'm porting a network RPC layer to Haskell
02:58:50 <silentdea> sweet.
02:59:00 <shapr> my 'native' programming language is Python, the RPC layer I'm porting is for a python server framework
02:59:07 <shapr> that way I can use my two favorite languages together
02:59:26 <silentdea> i been learning python too. my native language is PHP
02:59:39 <shapr> cool, you're expanding your mind :-)
02:59:56 <shapr> I've found that learning new languages increases my ability to use ones that I already know.
03:00:01 <silentdea> yep. php is good, but i find its structure not suited for large software developments
03:00:06 <silentdea> i mean three isnt even multiple inheritance
03:00:20 <shapr> I don't know much about php, I've only used it for a few hours total.
03:00:25 <shapr> but from what I saw, I would agree with you.
03:00:51 <silentdea> its a powerful language, super quick to pick up on and you can write the most obscenely largest programs in a matter of hours.
03:01:30 <shapr> I was unhappy with the code culture of php.
03:01:36 <shapr> inline code seems to be the standard.
03:01:47 <silentdea> inline? as in, contained within html?
03:01:58 <shapr> somewhat that
03:02:06 <shapr> but more that the code was rarely in functions
03:02:15 <shapr> and so, difficult to use outside of the one page it was written for
03:02:35 <silentdea> i hate it like that. i am trying to develop a templating system but am having lil luck. well i have a system but its rather slow and all.
03:03:01 <silentdea> ah, all my php cod is done within classes and functions now. and minimal inline code joining it together
03:03:08 <shapr> I much prefer to put stuff into reusable bits as much as possible.
03:03:26 <shapr> I like that approach you just described :-)
03:03:34 <silentdea> yep thats what i have been doing lately. i jsut wrote a pop3 and mime mail class today.
03:03:39 <shapr> nifty!
03:04:15 <silentdea> and then i wrote another class which extends the pop3 to retrieve mail into either a db or to files, and then you can use the mail class which will later be extended by a web based mail class, to work with the data
03:04:42 <silentdea> but if i had multiple inheritances it would be a lot better, i could make a standard error handling class and include that too, and other stuff
03:04:46 <shapr> what do you think of having a mail_storage class or so?
03:04:58 <silentdea> well i basically have
03:05:03 <silentdea> class pop3
03:05:03 <shapr> nifty :-)
03:05:13 <silentdea> class mail_sorter extends pop3
03:05:17 <silentdea> class mail_parse
03:05:26 <silentdea> class web_based_mail extends mail_parse
03:05:27 <shapr> what if you want to add imap4?
03:05:50 <shapr> I like your design btw :-)
03:05:54 <silentdea> class mail_sorter extends imap4
03:06:03 <silentdea> then it stores it all centrally
03:06:12 <shapr> I'm just asking difficult questions that bosses often ask :-)
03:06:36 <shapr> could you have "class pop3 extends mail_retriever"
03:06:39 <silentdea> hehe, ive never worked in an IT job, im only 19 you see. so its good tat you question:)
03:06:56 <shapr> that way you might be able to reuse code between the pop3 and imap4 classes?
03:07:34 <shapr> it's cool to get started in programming early :)
03:07:49 <silentdea> i been programming since i was 12, but that was just BASIC on a commodore 64
03:07:56 <silentdea> 64/128 rather
03:08:12 <silentdea> then it all died off then when iwas 17 i got back into it with PHP
03:08:24 <silentdea> as for the class extending mail retriever
03:08:34 <silentdea> i wanted mail retriever on top of pop3/imap4
03:08:47 <silentdea> because it provides the high level abstraction layer
03:08:50 <silentdea> like
03:08:59 <silentdea> mail_retrieve::get_mail()
03:09:14 <silentdea> and then the get mail class will work with either protocol depending what it is extending
03:09:20 <silentdea> i think
03:09:35 <shapr> what about having a central class that gets passed a retrieval class in its constructor?
03:09:46 <silentdea> retrieval class?
03:09:58 <shapr> can you have a class as a value?
03:10:04 <shapr> I don't know much about PHP :-/
03:10:31 <silentdea> what do you mean a class as a value? like i pass an object to the contructor?
03:10:34 <silentdea> like
03:10:35 <shapr> right
03:10:48 <silentdea> $obj = new class_name;
03:10:58 <silentdea> $obj2 = new class_name2($obj);
03:10:58 <silentdea> ?
03:11:03 <shapr> right
03:11:24 <silentdea> i never really tried that before. but that could take care of multiple inheritances problem
03:11:43 <silentdea> if my constructor was
03:11:47 <shapr> $my_pop3 = new pop3("localhost",110,"shapr","password")
03:11:57 <shapr> $my_mailer = new mailer($my_pop3)
03:12:12 <silentdea> i see, i see.
03:12:19 <silentdea> i never thought of it like that
03:12:36 <shapr> if you assumed that the class passed to the constructor was ready to have its "retrieve_mail()" method called
03:13:37 <silentdea> and to change it to imap i would just pass $my_mailer = new mailer($my_imap4)
03:13:38 <silentdea> right?
03:13:45 <shapr> right
03:14:04 <silentdea> and pop3 and imap4 would have to contain the exact methods and return the data in the same format
03:14:11 <shapr> you could even have "new mailer($my_folder)" to use a directory full of email
03:14:17 <shapr> right
03:14:23 <silentdea> so therefore i could even support other protocols.
03:14:30 <shapr> as long as the methods were named the same way, and the return formats are the same, it's no problem.
03:14:35 <silentdea> or as you just said, file system based.
03:14:58 <shapr> in fact, you could do it the other way around as well
03:15:09 <shapr> you could have an email writer that worked like that
03:15:36 <shapr> some people want to put their email into imap4 folders, or sometimes local filesystem folders
03:15:59 <silentdea> id have to seperate it into
03:16:03 <silentdea> pop3_retrieve
03:16:10 <shapr> you could even support an ftp_mail_writer if you wanted to
03:16:11 <silentdea> smtp_send
03:16:15 <silentdea> imap4_retrieve
03:16:17 <silentdea> imap4_send
03:16:19 <silentdea> and then pass
03:16:44 <silentdea> $my_mailer = new mailer($send_obj, $recv_obj)
03:16:56 <silentdea> or would you pair them
03:17:02 <silentdea> pop3/smtp
03:17:13 <silentdea> and write one class for each pair?
03:17:21 <shapr> I'd leave them separate
03:17:44 <silentdea> i could then have pop3 for incoming and filesystem for out, true
03:17:56 <shapr> right, you don't need to explicitly pair them then
03:18:57 <shapr> and your mailer class could also turn users pop3 email (from yahoo maybe) into imap4 email (on their 'net accessible server)
03:20:02 <silentdea> yahoo have pop3 servers?
03:20:06 <shapr> yup
03:20:39 <silentdea> never knew that!
03:22:01 <silentdea> would haskell be a good language for making pop3 clients etc?
03:22:06 <silentdea> or is it suited to other applications?
03:22:58 <shapr> I'd like to write a pop3 client in haskell :-)
03:23:35 <silentdea> how long have you been using haskell for?
03:25:26 <shapr> um
03:25:33 <shapr> since last september?
03:25:48 <shapr> I think
03:26:00 <shapr> I've been learning it in my spare time after work and on the weekends.
03:26:05 <shapr> and I don't have so much spare time.
03:26:20 <silentdea> ah bummer. but still, thats a fair length of time
03:26:22 <shapr> what about you?
03:26:35 <silentdea> with php, after 4 months experience i was programming a website which received 6million page views monthly
03:26:39 <silentdea> haskell = 0
03:26:54 <silentdea> hehe, jsut browsing around, and am reading about it now. downloading HUGS right now too.
03:27:10 <silentdea> they claim haskell to be good for CGI
03:27:20 * shapr thinks about that
03:27:25 <Heffalump> hmm, not particularly
03:27:36 <Heffalump> there's some stuff you can do nicely
03:27:37 <shapr> Haskell is a very different way of looking at life.
03:27:41 <Heffalump> HTML generation in Haskell is elegant
03:27:46 <shapr> yah, I agree with that.
03:27:49 <shapr> very elegant
03:28:12 <silentdea> where does it fail?
03:28:25 <shapr> haskell is a pain in the ass when it comes to doing input and output
03:28:41 <shapr> in many cases, it's more than worth it
03:28:53 <shapr> because it does other stuff so well
03:29:30 <ChilliX> shapr: I wouldn't agree with that (about the I/O), but I admit that it surely takes a bit to get used to
03:29:56 <shapr> ChilliX: you have a bit more experience using haskell than I do, it's true :-)
03:30:09 <shapr> silentdea: this might help some: http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/1/13/223854/606
03:30:18 <shapr> well, if you know XSLT it might help :-)
03:30:49 <silentdea> yerp, i know XSLT
03:31:16 <shapr> ok, that url is article written by Tom Moertel that talks about doing XSLT stuff with XSLT, Perl, and Haskell.
03:31:20 <shapr> I found it very interesting.
03:32:02 <silentdea> well it would be for me too, i like using XML and XSLT. If only browsers would hurry up and support it more on the client side.
03:32:34 <shapr> HaXml lets you compile a DTD to Haskell datatypes, and then do lots of nifty transformations on an XML doc.
03:32:43 <shapr> it's way spiffy.
03:33:41 <shapr> silentdea: I know unsw has Haskell courses, are you anywhere close to it?
03:33:55 * shapr knows nearly nothing of .au geography
03:34:26 * shapr would like to take Haskell courses someday
03:34:59 <silentdea> i am in melb, victoria. new south wales (nsw) is a 10 hour drive
03:34:59 <silentdea> hehe
03:35:11 <shapr> oh well :-)
03:35:21 <shapr> btw, how many hours to drive across .au?
03:35:27 <silentdea> my friend is at that uni. he does all different languages, he mightve even done it. i know he uses prolog, smalltalk, java, c\c++, visual basic, php, perl
03:35:36 <silentdea> um 3 days i guess hehe
03:35:38 <silentdea> thats taking breaks
03:35:47 <shapr> nice
03:35:47 <silentdea> ive never done it or heard of anyone doing it straight across.
03:35:51 <ChilliX> re IO: eg, catUpper fname = readFile fname >>= putStr . (map Char.toUpper)
03:36:04 <ChilliX> is enough to read a file from disk turn everything into upper case and print it
03:36:05 <shapr> I drove across most of the USA roundtrip.
03:36:16 <ChilliX> that's pretty compact, I would say
03:36:16 <silentdea> shapr: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mapshells/australasia/australia/australia.htm
03:36:22 <silentdea> i want to move to USA.
03:36:32 <shapr> like any place, it has its good and bad sides.
03:36:45 <silentdea> bad side numero uno: los angeles.
03:36:47 <shapr> imho, it's more important to find an area with people that are important to you
03:37:09 <silentdea> yer i guess, but i want to check out usa, and canada. and everywhere else while im at it.
03:37:16 <shapr> yah, I agree :-)
03:37:19 <silentdea> ChilliX: what does that do? jsut outputs text to the screen?
03:37:21 <shapr> I'm in Finland, it's great.
03:37:25 <Heffalump> Melbourne Uni has some people who have lots of papers in ICFP and PPDP this year
03:37:46 <shapr> I hear rumors unsw has some ICFP people too :-P
03:37:50 <silentdea> my girlfriend goes to melb uni :).
03:37:56 <silentdea> what is ICFP and PPDP ?
03:38:02 <ChilliX> silentdea: it define function catUpper that gets a filename as an argument, reads that file, turns all characters into upepr case and prints the whole lot
03:38:08 <Heffalump> ICFP = International Conference on Functional Programming
03:38:20 <Heffalump> PPDP = Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (mostly logic programming stuff)
03:39:06 <silentdea> ChilliX: i/o doesnt seem too hard then.
03:39:16 <silentdea> Heffalump: i see.
03:40:11 <ChilliX> silentdea: the tricky bit is that the type of a function encodes whether the function does do I/O or not
03:40:37 <ChilliX> that has a number of advantages, but it also requires some discipline in structuring your program
03:40:51 <ChilliX> (the structure usually gets better, but it takes some additional thinking)
03:42:14 <silentdea> went straight over my head. i gues i'll figure it all out if i decide to start on haskell :)
03:43:07 <shapr> I'd strongly recommend Haskell.
03:43:35 <shapr> In some parts it's hard work to adjust from procedural to functional programming.
03:43:49 <silentdea> yer, i am really used to procedural
03:44:03 <shapr> but you will be able to do new tricks in procedural languages that will amaze your friends :-)
03:44:20 <ChilliX> I started from procedural programming, too
03:44:26 <silentdea> none of my friends are programmers, so i'll have to jsut do with imrepssing myself
03:44:37 <shapr> ChilliX: how did you start?
03:44:48 * shapr is terribly curious
03:44:59 <ChilliX> some crazy mixture between basic and assembler language
03:45:15 <ChilliX> did a lot of modula-2 and assembler programming
03:45:22 <shapr> wow
03:45:28 <shapr> how old are you?
03:45:43 <silentdea> that's another thing i'd like to learn. ASM
03:45:45 <shapr> I vaguely recall you're not much older than I am.
03:45:52 <shapr> asm is nifty
03:46:02 <shapr> and kind of bzar
03:46:04 <ChilliX> not sure how old you are, but I am 37
03:46:08 <shapr> I'm 30
03:46:44 <ChilliX> and I have been programming since high school or earlier
03:46:53 <shapr> cool
03:47:01 <shapr> I wish I'd gotten into programming earlier.
03:47:54 <silentdea> ChilliX: whatrs modula-2 like? i jsut checked out a sample file and it looks pretty simple.
03:48:09 <ChilliX> silentdea: every had a look at Pascal?
03:48:14 <ChilliX> every = ever
03:48:24 <silentdea> yep. 
03:48:40 <ChilliX> it's bit like an extended version of Pascal
03:48:52 <ChilliX> or if you like, it's like C with a descent module system
03:49:19 <silentdea> sounds good.
03:49:32 <shapr> heya dblack
03:49:49 <dblack> hi shapr
03:50:07 <shapr> learned anything new lately?
03:50:22 <dblack> shapr: not too much :-)
03:50:33 <ChilliX> I am one of the three authors of http://www.tempel.org/files-e.html#MM2
03:51:15 <shapr> wow
03:51:42 <shapr> ChilliX: you speak german?
03:51:47 <silentdea> atari's kick ass.
03:51:58 <ChilliX> ahem, yes, I *am* German
03:52:07 <shapr> oh, I was not aware of that.
03:52:24 <ChilliX> I know, my name is disguising me well - hehehe
03:52:30 <shapr> yep :-)
03:54:18 <silentdea> where do i find the documentation for haskell? i cant find it on their website
03:54:27 <ChilliX> (to be perfectly fair, I am half German, half Indian, but I grew up in Germany)
03:54:34 <ChilliX> haskell.org
03:55:06 <ChilliX> (that explains the surname ;-)
03:55:30 <shapr> ChilliX: I've been curious :-)
03:55:40 <ChilliX> :-)
03:56:40 <shapr> silentdea: http://haskell.org/bookshelf/
03:57:30 <shapr> ChilliX: did you work on OXYD?
03:57:41 <ChilliX> Do you know Oxyd??
03:57:44 <shapr> heck yeah
03:57:47 <shapr> I loved that game.
03:57:48 <ChilliX> cool!
03:57:57 <ChilliX> I did some work for Oxyd
03:58:03 <shapr> wow, awesome :-)
03:58:06 <ChilliX> it was written in our Modula-2 system
03:58:10 <silentdea> shapr: thanks
03:58:13 <shapr> my mac fanatic friend introduced me to it
03:58:21 <shapr> he's been playing oxyd for many years
03:58:36 <ChilliX> hehehe
03:58:37 <shapr> I have to tell him I met someone who worked on it! he'll be jealous =)
03:59:26 <ChilliX> Meinolf Scheinder (the main author) worked for a while for the same company as Thomas Tempelmann
03:59:39 <ChilliX> (the guy whose web site has the Magamax system for download)
03:59:49 <shapr> cool
04:00:08 <ChilliX> Thomas and I did most of the Megamax Modula stuff
04:01:13 <ChilliX> and Meinolf later moved to the town where the company was that distributed it
04:01:20 * shapr prepares to gloat at his Mac fanatic friend
04:01:50 <shapr> I vaguely recall that my friend mentioned something about german, and modula in connection with Oxyd
04:02:12 <ChilliX> Do you know Heidelberg?  (city in the south)
04:02:18 <shapr> not really
04:02:24 <shapr> my fiancee is german though, I'll ask her.
04:02:40 <ChilliX> that's about where I grew up and close to where I went to uni
04:02:57 <shapr> nifty history
04:03:10 <silentdea> thanks for all the info guys. I am off for a while.
04:03:21 <ChilliX> silentdea: cu
04:03:23 <shapr> silentdea: come back and ask if you come up with any questions,
04:03:30 <shapr> silentdea: we'll try to hel
04:03:30 <shapr> p
04:03:36 <ChilliX> Meinolf and Thomas are some fine hackers
04:03:37 <silentdea> shall do, just added this chan to my autojoin list :)
04:03:44 <shapr> excellent :-)
04:03:49 <silentdea> ciao ciao :)
04:03:57 <shapr> cu
04:04:17 <shapr> I don't think I'd ever heard of modula when I was playing Oxyd
04:05:07 <ChilliX> Modula is a cool language, but due to Unix C just got much more popular
04:05:43 <shapr> I've noticed that technical merit doesn't mean market success
04:06:47 <ChilliX> true
04:06:59 <shapr> first examples I can think of are NeXT and MicroChannel
04:07:00 <ChilliX> though that changes soemwhat with oss
04:07:04 <shapr> yes, it does
04:07:15 <shapr> I thought Unix was going to die also, till Linux happened.
04:07:44 <ChilliX> yeah, Linux was a miracle
04:07:51 <shapr> truly
04:08:27 <shapr> in the commercial programming world, there are still many people who have never heard of it
04:08:54 <ChilliX> hmm, I actually don't think there are many left who haven't heard of it (having used it is a different matter)
04:09:17 <ChilliX> these days, when I buy hardware, I just tell the people, it has to work with Linux otherwise forget it
04:09:37 <shapr> ps. don't buy nvidia + smp :-)
04:09:43 <ChilliX> they often don't know whether it works with Linux, but they know what I mean and that there is no use discussing that point
04:10:00 <shapr> yah, same here.
04:10:03 <ChilliX> couple of years ago, that was very differnt
04:10:07 <shapr> yup
04:10:30 <shapr> I still have trouble persuading people to try it, even very technical windows people.
04:10:34 <ChilliX> also, did you see that Forbes special posted on /. recently?
04:10:38 <shapr> nope
04:11:21 <ChilliX> http://www.forbes.com/2002/07/16/linuxintro.html
04:11:24 <shapr> most of the techie windows people I know feel that Linux is only for servers, not for desktops.
04:11:36 <shapr> my screenshots have not persuaded them
04:11:59 <shapr> cool, nice url
04:12:05 <ChilliX> exactly on that matter, seeing Forbes praising the ease of use of some Linux software over Windows is quite amazing!
04:12:33 <shapr> you have an url for that?
04:13:51 <ChilliX> http://www.forbes.com/2002/07/16/0716tentech.html
04:13:59 <ChilliX> (this is about Gaim)
04:16:33 <shapr> cool
04:16:49 <shapr> I'll send this to some of my techie windows friends.
04:16:49 <clausen> shapr: yes
04:17:29 <shapr> clausen: should I register an ImageObserver on clausen.Image ?
04:19:32 <shapr> I'm still amazed that people pay money for windows.
04:19:54 <jewel> not just money,  LOTS of money
04:20:25 <shapr> yah, it's amazing.
04:22:39 <clausen> shapr: what's that?
04:22:39 <clausen> shapr: btw, if you have any comments on my photos, I'll stick them on my webpage :)
04:22:56 <shapr> clausen: Java joke, ImageObserver is an observer that waits for an Image to load and then notifies something
04:23:00 <clausen> [pde >> clausen] your photos are causing a reproducible crash in mozilla!?! (perhaps my laptop is sick) 
04:23:01 <clausen> !!!
04:23:13 <clausen> (perhaps the photos are sick?)
04:23:35 <clausen> actually, I suspect it was my being stupid with my script: <IMG SRC="index.html">...
04:24:33 <clausen> shapr: so, they take a long time to load?
04:24:37 <clausen> (the largest one is 50k!)
04:25:00 <shapr> I have a 300k/sec connect here
04:25:21 <shapr> I was actually wanting to be notified each time you changed your image
04:25:35 <shapr> you went from psychedelic to minimalistic, yah?
04:25:38 <clausen> yeah
04:25:49 <shapr> I was attempting to be punny.
04:25:57 * clausen understands
04:25:58 * clausen smiles :)
04:26:07 * shapr sees the pun go flatline
04:26:09 <shapr> :-)
04:26:20 <clausen> nah, it was funny, just I didn't get it
04:26:46 <shapr> yah, #java jokes fall flat here.
04:27:09 <clausen> so, which image do you prefer?
04:27:23 <shapr> I like the new minimalistic image.
04:27:31 * clausen too :)
04:27:38 <jewel> does gaim support yahoo?
04:27:40 <shapr> admittedly, I'm a guy, and so probably not your target audience.
04:27:45 <clausen> shapr: right
04:27:48 <shapr> jewel: from the article, yes
04:27:54 <clausen> (maybe I should say what my target audience is, *grin*)
04:27:57 <shapr> heh
04:27:59 <jewel> but the one in debian?
04:28:06 <shapr> I dunno
04:28:08 * shapr installs
04:29:16 <jewel> ah, you to load the plugin first
04:29:25 <jewel> so much for "the best IM client"
04:30:29 <shapr> does Haskell have first class continuations?
04:30:50 <ChilliX> no
04:30:59 <ChilliX> which is good and bad
04:31:17 <shapr> I'd like to play with continuations
04:31:30 <ChilliX> (the continuation business is more popular in the strict FP camp)
04:31:45 <ChilliX> you can always define your own continuation library
04:32:03 <shapr> I suspect I'm not that developed yet.
04:32:35 <ChilliX> with monads and thread support, there is not much you would need continuations for, I guess
04:33:13 <shapr> I don't know, I've not had tools available to play with first-class continuations.
04:33:37 <shapr> the first version of Stackless Python had them, but it wasn't much used
04:34:32 <ChilliX> there is a very strong correlation between monads and continuations
04:34:40 * shapr thinks about that
04:34:40 <ChilliX> (mom, I'll look for the paper)
04:37:12 <Marvin--> yay
04:37:13 <shapr> hi Marvin--!
04:37:14 * Heffalump still doesn't really understand the point of continuations
04:38:21 <shapr> I'd like to have serializable continuations
04:39:05 <shapr> Marvin--: do you go to chalmers?
04:39:28 <shapr> hi ChoJin
04:39:30 <Marvin--> shapr: I go to Göteborg University, but the comp.sci. institution encompasses both Chalmers and the university
04:39:44 <shapr> cool, have you had lectures from John Hughes?
04:39:48 <ChoJin> hi
04:40:13 <shapr> Marvin--: sooo, wanna help with TwistedHaskell? =)
04:40:28 <Marvin--> shapr: 'course I've had lectures from Hughes :)
04:40:34 <shapr> wow, awesome
04:40:37 <Marvin--> shapr: in my Copious Spare Time, sure :/
04:40:42 <shapr> hah
04:40:56 <Heffalump> Marvin--: do you have a supply of Copious Spare Time?
04:41:03 <shapr> yah, I want some too!
04:41:19 <Marvin--> Heffalump: nope :/
04:41:36 <Marvin--> I'm taking a course called Advanced Functional Programming this fall
04:41:37 <ChilliX> shapr: can't find it...
04:41:50 <Marvin--> Dunno if Hughes has it.. No I think that Koen Claesson has it
04:41:51 <ChilliX> shapr: it's an older paper, I think from Paul Hudak...
04:42:06 <Heffalump> Koen Claessen has what?
04:42:12 <ChilliX> shapr: in general, fully fledged continuations aren't serialisable, I think
04:42:17 <Marvin--> he's the lecturer of that course
04:42:30 <Heffalump> OIC
04:42:38 <shapr> ChilliX: I'll look for it, that's enough info that I'll be able to find it.
04:43:14 <shapr> there's a scheme implementation that can serialize continuations
04:43:15 <shapr> I wonder how they do it.
04:43:58 <Heffalump> it's the same problem as suspending and resuming a process, surely?
04:44:04 <shapr> I think so.
04:44:17 <Heffalump> oh, and of transmitting a process to another computer, if you want to be able to do that with the serialised continuation too
04:44:26 <shapr> right
04:44:42 <shapr> stackless python couldn't do it because the python interpreter was recursive at some points
04:44:44 <ChilliX> if you have first class continuations, you can't even do generall callbacks from foreign function calls
04:45:04 <shapr> ?
04:45:28 <ChilliX> the SML of New Jersey guys found that
04:45:41 <Heffalump> because the continuation might cause the FF call to be repeated from half-way through?
04:45:46 <ChilliX> if you have first class conts
04:46:07 <ChilliX> and you want to be able, eg, to call C functions and those C functions to call back to your FP language
04:46:17 <ChilliX> (eg, callsbacks in aGUI)
04:46:34 <ChilliX> then, you can't do that arbitrarily back and forth
04:47:10 <shapr> sounds like another paper worth reading.
04:47:21 <ChilliX> (at least not if you only have one runtime stack for C only)
04:47:45 <ChilliX> first class continuations are good in a stackless language, with stacks, they are a bit of a mess
04:47:57 <ChilliX> btw, does the stack-based Python impl support them?
04:48:05 <shapr> nope
04:48:35 <shapr> stackless python v2 has changed the model, now it supports continuations, but they're not first class, and you can't really access them.
04:50:17 <ChilliX> ok, otherwise I would have been quite surprised
04:50:29 <ChilliX> first-class conts and stacks just don't mix
04:50:33 <shapr> I wish it were otherwise.
04:50:56 <ChilliX> but you can implement threads with 1st class conts
04:50:57 <shapr> also, the creator of Python doesn't really want that kind of stuff (1st class conts) in Python.
04:51:08 <ChilliX> so, its a conceptual thing
04:51:18 <ChilliX> ic
04:51:25 <shapr> yes, one of the powerful things about the first version of stackless python were the microthreads
04:51:46 <shapr> you could run ten thousand microthreads in the space of several hundred standard python threads.
04:52:10 <shapr> that led to a MMORPG server being implemented in stackless python v1
04:54:25 <ChilliX> ic
04:54:37 <ChilliX> GHC's threads are actually also pretty lightweight
04:55:02 <shapr> yah, I like the model of matching GHC threads to anonymous OS threads whenever something needs to be done
04:55:13 <shapr> I hope the HOpenGL problem doesn't change that model.
04:55:24 <ChilliX> only when something external that may block needs to be done
04:55:36 <ChilliX> the Haskell local threads are microthreads
04:55:47 <ChilliX> no association with OS threads whatsoever
04:56:23 <shapr> nifty
04:56:33 <shapr> I haven't tried GHC threading yet.
04:56:59 <ChilliX> it's cool
04:57:06 <ChilliX> I use that fact in the ports library
04:57:51 * shapr resolves to try GHC threading soon
05:10:29 <shapr> I've been thinking about Erlang's ability to upgrade a running system, is that possible in Haskell?
05:10:38 <shapr> is it prohibitively difficult?
05:11:01 <ChilliX> there is no Haskell compiler that supports it
05:11:29 <ChilliX> but I don't think that there is conceptual problem that would prevent such a mechanism being implemented
05:11:32 <ChilliX> (it is nifty!)
05:11:47 <Heffalump> upgrade a running system in what sense?
05:11:48 * shapr thinks of how that would work
05:12:11 <ChilliX> GHC's features are basically implemented on a strongest-demand-first basis
05:12:32 <ChilliX> runtime upgrades haven't been much asked for, I guess
05:12:43 <jewel> because no-one had them before?
05:12:57 <ChilliX> btw, you can do some pretty cool runtime code loading tricks with GHC
05:12:57 <shapr> erlang is the only such sytem that I know of
05:13:01 <shapr> really?
05:13:05 <Heffalump> oh, how?
05:13:19 <ChilliX> actually, it might be relatively easy to improve those to allow upgrades, too
05:13:38 * shapr has much interest piqued
05:13:58 <ChilliX> a student of mine did it for a project he did last session
05:14:09 <ChilliX> we are planning to maybe write a paper about it
05:14:22 <ChilliX> I am not sure whether he has put anything on the web yet
05:14:30 <Heffalump> I'd been thinking it wouldn't be that hard to given the framework ghci provides
05:14:36 <Heffalump> s/hard to/hard to do/
05:14:37 <ChilliX> but if you are interested email andrep@cse.unsw.edu.au
05:14:52 <ChilliX> I am sure, he'll be happy to give you all the gory details and more ;-)
05:15:15 <shapr> nifty
05:15:46 <Heffalump> hasn't he been on here, or am I imagining things?
05:16:24 <ChilliX> he may have been
05:16:30 <shapr> I think he has been here.
05:16:40 <ChilliX> but I haven't heard much of him the last couple of weeks (he was away skiing for a while)
05:17:01 <ChilliX> Did he talk about his project?
05:17:12 <ChilliX> text formatting system in Haskell
05:17:25 <shapr> that sounds vaguely familiar
05:17:29 <ChilliX> rather a markup language that can be translated into all kinds of other formats
05:17:36 <Heffalump> oooh
05:17:42 <Heffalump> that sounds useful too.
05:17:46 <ChilliX> he often hanging out on irc
05:17:51 <ChilliX> he = he is
05:18:34 <ChilliX> nick would have been o3 or ozine
05:18:38 <ChilliX> ozine = ozone
05:18:54 <shapr> yah, that sounds very familiar
05:19:00 <ChilliX> ok :-)
05:19:17 <ChilliX> he know all about dynamically loading modules with GHC
05:19:26 <ChilliX> know = knows
05:19:33 <shapr> he hasn't been on OPN in seven weeks ( /msg nickserv info o3 )
05:19:51 <Heffalump> so did he use the ghci infrastructure?
05:20:00 <ChilliX> that would have been roughly since exams started ;-)
05:20:10 <ChilliX> Heffalump: yup
05:21:15 <ChilliX> oh, yes, and then, he got hooked on NWN
05:21:20 <shapr> hah
05:21:34 <shapr> I want to get the Linux version of that when they release it
05:21:47 <ChilliX> already preordered it
05:21:53 <ChilliX> hope they release it soon
05:22:14 <ChilliX> o3 has been telling many good things about it
05:46:51 <Heffalump> NWM?
05:47:04 <shapr> never winter nights I think
05:47:06 * shapr looks for the url
05:48:32 <shapr> bah, my isp sucks
05:48:41 <shapr> in any case, you can find details on tuxgames.com
05:51:10 <Heffalump> oh, right, a game
05:51:25 * Heffalump wastes too much time on other random things so doesn't play games
05:53:06 <Igloo> Risk!
05:54:37 * Igloo wonders why "Buy" and "Impulse buy" are different
05:57:04 <Heffalump> different in what sense?
05:57:13 <Heffalump> And Risk doesn't count, and neither do Civ II or III :-p
05:57:58 <shapr> of course, those aren't games ;-)
05:58:01 <shapr> those are..
05:58:02 <shapr> um..
05:58:06 <shapr> education experiences
05:58:23 <Heffalump> absolutely.
06:01:37 <Igloo> tuxgames had a button for each of them
06:02:12 <shapr> I guess impulse buy means it can save your payment information for one-click purchasing later
06:02:25 <shapr> of course, they can't say one-click, becuase Amazon has protection on that
06:03:54 <Heffalump> lol
06:04:08 <Igloo> :-)
06:34:54 <shapr> html generation is sooo much more elegant in Haskell.
06:35:08 <ChilliX> :-)
06:35:18 * shapr curses at JSPs
07:14:31 <silentdea> heylo?
07:18:11 <shapr> y0
07:18:14 <shapr> what's up?
07:19:23 <shapr> silentdea: you have a question?
07:30:01 <ChilliX> g'nite
07:30:05 * ChilliX is away: Not at the machine...
07:43:52 <shapr> hi bobov
07:44:04 <shapr> g'nite ChilliX
07:44:18 <shapr> bobov: looking for Haskell answers? or bringing questions?
07:44:23 <shapr> ahem
07:44:33 <shapr> bringing questions or answers?
07:44:41 <shapr> geez, I've been staring at too many JSPs today.
07:44:50 * shapr decides to go home.
07:46:45 <bobov> shapr// no! i want nothing.
07:46:47 <bobov> just for fun.
07:47:15 <shapr> oh, ok
08:38:21 <shapr> hi Dalroth
08:38:26 <shapr> what's up?
08:38:36 <Dalroth> internet connection sucks lately :(
08:38:48 <Dalroth> dog's been chewing on the chair
08:38:50 <shapr> :-(
08:38:54 <shapr> how's your scripting language going?
08:39:21 <Dalroth> haven't touched it... I bought some lego mindstorms and Neverwinter Nights, so when I'm not out with my friends I'm usually busy with those things :)
08:39:48 <shapr> heh
08:39:57 <shapr> I'm looking forward to NWN on Linux
09:48:46 <Shillo> Hello, folks. :)
09:49:48 <Heffalump> hi
10:17:39 <Shillo> Hey, I wonder if anybody's working on a OO extension to Haskell that'd be usable from GHC?
10:17:44 <Shillo> (the only one I know is for hugs)
10:18:05 <Igloo> O'Haskell is the one I think I've heard of. Presumably that's the hugs one, though
10:18:15 <Shillo> Yeah.
10:18:36 <Shillo> Mondrian is the other, but it's not /quite/ Haskell and it's not quite out and it's not really cool (lacks basic stuff)
10:18:46 <Heffalump> "not quite out"?
10:19:42 <Shillo> Not in anything resembling releasable shape. It depends on .NET, after all. :P
10:19:53 <Heffalump> I thought there was a non-.NET version
10:20:30 <Shillo> Dunno. Is there?
10:20:31 <Heffalump> oh, maybe not
10:20:43 <Shillo> :)
10:21:09 <Heffalump> oh, there was a Java version a while ago
10:21:13 * Heffalump blames Erik Meijer
10:24:03 <Shillo> Sounds interesting. :)
10:33:42 * Shillo waves. Laters!
12:48:20 * shapr boings
12:48:46 <buggs> hoi shapr

12:49:08 <shapr> how ar ya?
12:49:26 <buggs> fine fine and u?
12:50:20 <shapr> just getting some time to code
12:52:56 <shapr> buggs: how's Haskell treating you?
12:53:43 <buggs> wish i was fit enough for the comtest
12:53:46 <buggs> *contest
12:54:11 <shapr> I hope I am.
12:54:14 <shapr> still not sure :-)
12:56:20 <buggs> think i could help with the cvs server, if needed
12:57:24 <shapr> we have a cvs server!
12:57:28 <shapr> oh
12:57:30 <shapr> I forgot the topic
12:57:31 <shapr> doh

13:32:02 <shapr> y0 dblack
13:33:02 <dblack> hi shapr
13:33:06 <dblack> by the way...
13:33:16 <shapr> yes?
13:33:17 <dblack> do you remember there was a team working on a haskell tutorial...
13:33:20 <shapr> yes!
13:33:35 <dblack> and there was talk of bringing them together with the 'language of the year' project
13:33:41 <dblack> is that (tutorial) still happening?
13:33:42 <shapr> that would be a good idea
13:33:48 <shapr> it hasn't been happening lately.
13:33:52 <dblack> hmmm
13:34:21 <dblack> i know some of the LotY people are eager for haskell exercises :-)
13:34:40 <shapr> did you see the suggestion I posted about tom moertel's solutions?
13:35:03 <dblack> where did you post it?  to the mailing list?
13:35:08 <dblack> or wiki?
13:35:19 <shapr> yes pragprog mailing list
13:35:30 <dblack> hmmm... i must have seen it, perhaps haven't read the latest ones carefully
13:35:56 <dblack> also i didn't get some of them because of an email problem
13:36:08 <dblack> i'll have to check the yahoo site
13:36:23 <shapr> I can get the url if you want
13:36:28 <dblack> ok
13:37:25 * shapr scurfles about
13:38:09 <dblack> don't worry -- i can find it
13:38:26 <shapr> almost there
13:38:40 <shapr> I think
13:39:14 <shapr> aha

13:42:03 <shapr> dblack: looks good?
13:42:14 <dblack> yes, got it
13:42:59 <dblack> ok, now i've found your original email :-)
13:43:06 <shapr> yay!
13:43:09 <shapr> I thought I sent that.
13:53:34 <shapr> dblack: I'll ping the HTUT list
13:53:40 <shapr> I don't even remember where the cvs tree went to
14:20:25 <shapr> hi nde
14:22:15 <nde> hi shapr
14:22:41 <shapr> are you learning Haskell? or already know it?
14:23:15 <nde> just looking in, because haskell is IMHO the best language i know. I did a little programming in hs, because i had to write a paper about monads in haskell....
14:23:21 <shapr> nifty
14:23:34 <shapr> we have some good discussions here
14:23:53 <shapr> though at the moment both the .au and .eu parts aren't awake.
14:23:55 <nde> But i have never used haskell in "real life".
14:24:39 <shapr> you mean, you've never made money with it?
14:24:44 <shapr> what counts as "real life" ?
14:25:35 <nde> yup, only some small things for study. The sad thing about haskell is, that after getting to know it, you really dont like any other language anymore ;-(
14:26:46 <nde> "real life" meaning: solve an actual problem versus learning something
14:27:30 <shapr> I make money building websites, I plan on integrating Haskell into my setup.
14:27:44 <shapr> I agree, Haskell is very addictive.
14:27:57 <shapr> but I am also convinced it's worth using for business purposes
14:28:05 <shapr> or at least, I'm willing to bet my income on it :-)
14:28:38 <shapr> can you think of something real that you'd like to write?
14:28:41 <shapr> then you could do it in Haskell!
14:29:58 <Dalroth> I like haskell, but I'm not willing to bet my income on it
14:30:12 <Dalroth> there's too much infrastructure that just isn't present yet
14:30:19 <nde> Well one big point against it is lacking connectivity. I do database work mainly. There are some interesting database libs on haskell.org, but none looks "ready for production".
14:30:34 <Dalroth> which is a good example of what I just said :)
14:30:44 <Dalroth> it's fun, but critical pieces are still missing
14:31:19 <Dalroth> same goes for most of the functional languages though, except maybe Lisp
14:31:31 <Dalroth> but Lisp has it's own demons
14:37:42 <shapr> seems like the only cure is to put that infrastructure in place.
14:38:10 <shapr> what pieces would you most like to see?
14:38:13 <Dalroth> and that takes time and money which I would willingly donate if I had :)
14:38:35 <Dalroth> my three biggest are world class XML support, GUI, and database support
14:38:45 <Dalroth> I have not looked into haskell database stuff yet
14:38:48 <shapr> for me, I work best when writing code I need right now
14:38:52 <Dalroth> but am highly dissapointed with GUI and XML right now
14:39:04 <shapr> I haven't tried HaXml, you don't like it?
14:39:14 <Dalroth> it's horribly documented
14:39:18 <shapr> I also haven't tried the gtk2hs stuff
14:39:22 <Dalroth> the DTD stuff is bad
14:39:24 <shapr> though I will at some point.
14:39:30 <Dalroth> I do all my work with schemas, not DTD
14:39:30 <shapr> what needs fixing or changing?
14:39:54 <Dalroth> well, DTDs should have never been invented in the first place, but that's not haskell's fault :)
14:40:11 <Dalroth> the choice of using DTDs as the basis for the API (at least that portion of it) was poor in my opinion
14:40:20 <shapr> can you fix it? :-)
14:40:24 <Dalroth> DTDs are horribly limited and drastically reduce the flexibility of what you can accomplish with XML
14:40:26 <Dalroth> no
14:40:28 <shapr> oh
14:40:31 <Dalroth> as I said, I don't have the time or money to do it
14:40:43 <Dalroth> if I was paid to sit at home and write GNU code all day the first thing I'd do is write an XML library for haskell
14:40:50 <Dalroth> but I get paid to write visual basic and c++ COM shit
14:40:52 <Dalroth> it sucks
14:41:01 <shapr> sounds like it.
14:41:03 <Dalroth> but I get paid, I make my own hours, and I do things my way (within that context anyway)
14:41:07 <Dalroth> so what can I do? :(
14:41:15 <shapr> sneak up on it?
14:41:25 <Dalroth> I'll look for a better job one day, but right now I want to focus on classes and finding a woman that'll stick around for more than  few weeks ;)
14:41:25 <shapr> write a little bit of your dream lib each weekend?
14:41:36 <Dalroth> nah, because my free time I'm writing a game :)
14:41:41 <shapr> ah
14:41:58 <Dalroth> or at least pretending too, lately I've been busy with real life things
14:42:05 <Dalroth> which is a nice change of pace for once heheh
14:42:11 <shapr> I'm writing an RPC layer between the Twisted server framework and Haskell.
14:42:37 <shapr> that should allow me to integrate all of my Python knowledge and instaled codebase with all the cool parts of Haskell.
14:43:03 <Dalroth> my ideal library would allow me to completely dump SAX, DOM, and XSL for a Haskell solution (or other functional language)
14:43:19 <Dalroth> but my big requirement is that the fp solution has to be at least as readable as XSL+XPath
14:43:21 <shapr> well, think it up, write it up, people might implement it.
14:43:26 <Dalroth> as verbose and limited as it is, it's very readable
14:43:39 <Dalroth> lots of the haskell stuff I see looks more like perl
14:43:43 <shapr> I'd argue that familiarity makes anything readable, and vice versa
14:43:50 <shapr> bad code can be written in any language.
14:43:57 <Dalroth> yes, of course
14:43:58 <shapr> same with good code :-)
14:44:11 <Dalroth> but I picked up XSL far quicker than the Haskell XSL stuff
14:44:13 <shapr> haskell can be too concise sometimes.
14:44:18 <Dalroth> a lot of that has to do with documentation
14:44:21 <shapr> that's true.
14:44:27 <shapr> wanna help with the Haskell Tutorial? :-)
14:44:29 <Dalroth> but a lot of that has to do with they chose power and flexibility over readability with the haskell version
14:44:32 <shapr> write some docs?
14:44:47 <Dalroth> the haskell XML stuff isn't targeted at every day developers, it's more for people who like writing parsers/interpreters/programming languages and the like
14:44:52 <Dalroth> hello
14:44:55 <shapr> hi
14:44:58 <Dalroth> I don't have the time :)
14:45:02 <shapr> yah well.
14:45:02 <Dalroth> if I did I might :)
14:45:06 <shapr> ok
14:45:18 <shapr> I'd like to learn the HaXml stuff
14:45:29 <shapr> so much to learn and do, so little time...
14:45:39 <Dalroth> true true
14:45:53 <shapr> I have a tendency to jump across empty space...
14:46:02 <shapr> quit my job and go freelance doing web work for example
14:46:06 <shapr> it's worked so far.
14:46:38 <shapr> I hope that integrating Haskell will allow me to generate web sites faster than before.
14:46:48 <Dalroth> I don't like freelancing...  The money is nice, but keeping track of your hours, and networking with people, and the down periods when you have no work are frustrating
14:47:03 <Dalroth> of course
14:47:11 <Dalroth> not that 40hour/week job is much different
14:47:24 <Dalroth> it's the same stuff, you're just networking with different kinds of people
14:47:34 <Dalroth> but it's more consistent for me anyway, at least at this poitn in my life
14:47:45 <nde> 40 hours/week: nice ;-)
14:47:54 <Dalroth> I refuse to work more than 40 :)
14:48:15 <Dalroth> I WILL work more than 40, but if somebody thinks I'm going to do it for them on a regular basis without some serious compensation they've got another thing coming :)
14:49:02 <nde> well long weeks are ok, if they are limited to the last two or three weeks before a release...
14:49:22 * dblack loves the academic calendar
14:49:35 <Dalroth> yeah, that's perfectly understandable
14:49:42 <Dalroth> or when a server blows up at 3am on a saturday night
14:49:51 <Dalroth> sometimes things just need to get done
14:49:59 <Dalroth> I just feel sad for the people who let companies take advantage of them though
14:50:05 <Dalroth> you have to admit, computer geeks are pushovers
14:50:13 <Dalroth> that's why many work 60-80 hour weeks on salary
14:50:19 <Dalroth> they don't know how to say no
14:50:23 <Dalroth> but I do, so I'm ok :)
14:50:43 <dblack> isn't there an old song, "I'm just a geek who can't say no..." ... oh, no, it's "girl" :-)
14:51:04 <Dalroth> hehe
14:52:07 <Dalroth> anyway, one last jab at haskell, which is really more of a jab at some of the people who use it than haskell itself
14:52:11 <Dalroth> back to the XML stuff
14:52:31 <Dalroth> the thing I don't like about the current XML libraries, is they seem to go somewhat against why I chose haskell as my primary functional language in the first place
14:52:56 <Dalroth> in haskell, you can write very pure, clean, and readable code
14:53:04 <Dalroth> I can look at a simple haskell program and understand it
14:53:31 <Dalroth> but when you start creating functions named stuff like '<\\' or $!! or whatever (it's been awhile so I don't remember the exact ones) it starts to look like perl
14:53:48 <shapr> come up with something better :-)
14:54:01 <Dalroth> there's no consistency in the way the symbols are used from program to program, so each symbol ends up having an arbitary meaning and you're left with no quick way to determine what's going on
14:54:03 <shapr> I get paid hourly, and I do work more than forty hours per week.
14:54:15 <shapr> I've seen what you're talking about.
14:54:18 <nde> Well, the nice thing about haskell is, that you can create problem specific languages within haskell. ( But not perl though )
14:54:21 <Dalroth> if anything, all those symbolic functions in HaXml should be converted into ENGLISH functions :)
14:54:26 <shapr> I'd like to have a better way of systematically assigning meaning.
14:54:43 <shapr> yah, I prefer significant names myself.
14:55:16 <shapr> I've worked 60-80 hours a week on salary, that wasn't much fun.
14:55:26 <shapr> I did learn a lot of cool stuff in the process :-)
14:55:33 <Dalroth> hehe, yeah
14:55:44 <Dalroth> you do learn a lot in that environment
14:56:06 <shapr> I've also discovered that I can learn just as quickly, and the stuff I'm interested in
14:56:11 <shapr> but not get paid for it
14:56:29 <shapr> I'm getting paid for java and zope work at the moment.
14:56:37 <Dalroth> yeah, same here.  If I care for something, I'll learn it.  If I don't I won't, doesn't matter what environment it's in (classes, home, work, whatever)
14:57:29 <Dalroth> well, anyway, it's been fun.  I know i picked on haskell a bit, I love it and it's my favorite of all the functional languages.  Little by little it will get better, maybe one day there will be enough critical mass to push it over the edge...  Wouldn't that be nice ? :)
14:57:38 <shapr> yah, it would.
14:57:39 <Dalroth> ttyl
14:57:44 <shapr> seeya
14:58:50 * shapr goes back to writing Haskell <-> Python code
16:47:34 * Chilli is back (gone 00:00:05)
16:49:28 <Heffalump> morning
17:11:01 <Chilli> Moin Heffalump
21:58:27 * jens wonders if there is a way to override a modules in a ghc package
21:58:51 <jens> module even
21:59:13 <jens> like, errhm POpen in posix
21:59:28 * jens looks innocently the other way...
22:00:01 <jens> wish i had updated it before 5.04 :-(
22:00:05 <Chilli> not really
22:00:22 <jens> thought so
22:00:46 <Chilli> you have to use a package as a whole or not at all
22:01:10 <Chilli> (due to cross-module inlining, the binaries of other modulesin the package may actually incvlude code of any other module
22:01:16 <Chilli> no way to change that 
22:01:23 <Chilli> (without recompiling)
22:01:58 <jens> oh well, i'll just rename my private POpen then for now
22:02:07 <jens> thanks
