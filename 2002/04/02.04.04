02:21:05 <jewel> anybody know of a clever log analysis tool ... where one could write rules saying "when such event occurs make sure such event occurred within x time,if this failure occurred, alert me"
02:21:20 <Heffalump> I started writing something to do that in perl a while ago
02:21:23 <Heffalump> never finished it though
02:21:47 <jewel> it would need a language  to describe the states,events,expected results, error conditions
02:22:02 <Heffalump> yeah
02:22:20 <Heffalump> I started writing something specific, then started designing a language to generalise it
02:22:23 <Heffalump> but never finished it
02:22:56 <Heffalump> it'd probably be best done as an embedding in Haskell, I suspect
02:24:04 <jewel> what do you mean by embedding
02:24:22 <jewel> did you flesh out any concepts for what the language would have to describe?
02:25:52 <Heffalump> I wrote a sample program in the language, but I don't seem to have got much beyond writing a lexer/parser for it
02:26:16 <jewel> still have it?
02:26:34 <Heffalump> yeah, I'm just looking at it now
02:27:14 <Heffalump> I think the language is a bit of a mess really, hence the above comment about it being better redone as an embedding in Haskell
02:27:45 <Heffalump> by embedding I mean basically write a Haskell library that handles all the underlying functionality
03:08:18 <jewel> can I see the sample program?
03:10:33 <Heffalump> I'll send you a tarball of the lot - what's your email address?
03:13:09 <Heffalump> actually just grab it from http://munchkin.earth.li/~ganesh/logproc.tar.gz
03:24:54 <jewel> .li?
03:25:21 <Heffalump> Liechtenstein, not that that's relevant
03:39:09 <jewel> I don't understand how the states work
03:44:02 * Heffalump not 100% sure either :-)
03:44:09 <Heffalump> I wrote all that a while back
03:44:13 <Heffalump> what do you want to know?
03:44:50 <jewel> Umm what the second line do?
03:44:52 <jewel>  INPUT "sshd[$pid]: log: Generating {new }?768 bit RSA key.":
03:44:52 <jewel>       init ==> NEWSTATE regen($stamp);
03:46:44 <Heffalump> it tells it to go into that state for that item
05:04:06 <jewel> what is the name of the state?
05:08:48 <Heffalump> regen
05:08:55 <Heffalump> with parameters $stamp
10:35:28 * pesco is away: food
23:55:50 <fullets> can i ask a stupid question?
