08:53:53 <Logan> I'm trying to learn how to use an ST.
08:55:43 <Heffalump> and?
09:00:23 <Logan> Having a hard time getting over the hump. :P
09:00:34 <Logan> I understand the concept, just can't seem to write any code to use it.
09:00:43 <Logan> http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/23/104451/644
09:01:30 <Logan> Let's say I have a f unction that's supposed to read in a command and transform the state based on it... I suppose it'd be of type String -> IO ST State String ?
09:02:29 <Heffalump> mixing IO and ST monads is a bit tricky
09:02:40 <Heffalump> that isn't quite the way to do it
09:03:04 <Heffalump> look at stToIO
09:03:14 <Logan> I don't have any good documentation for stToIO. :P
09:03:27 <Heffalump> you don't need any, just look at the type
09:03:33 <Logan> Ok.
09:04:28 <Logan> So, let's say I have a function that takes a filename as input and modifies the state by basically loading that files contents into state... it would just be String -> IO () ?
09:07:48 <Heffalump> yeah
09:08:22 * Heffalump tries to figure out how to get out STRefs when in IO
09:09:14 <Heffalump> hmm.
09:09:22 <Heffalump> (without using unsafeIOtoST)
09:20:05 <Logan> Maybe I should learn ST with a simpler program. :P
09:24:41 <Heffalump> heh
09:25:25 <Heffalump> if you write your program so the outer bit is IO, and the inner bit is ST
09:25:35 <Heffalump> then you just use stToIO to move from the inner bit to the outer bit
09:40:31 <Logan> Yeah, but for this problem, some of the inner bit is IO. ):
09:41:58 <Heffalump> use IORefs not STRefs then
16:03:04 <Logan> If I wanted to make a loop, that just output a prompt, then read in a line of output and echoed it, then repeated, how would I do that?
16:12:13 <Logan> I'm trying to output a prompt before reading something in, and it's not being output until I output a newline... how do I force a flush?
16:12:41 <Logan> hFlush stdout?
16:13:36 <Logan> Ah hah!
16:13:41 <Logan> That fixed everything.
16:34:03 <Igloo> You might want to use hSetBuffering (IIRC) to set stdout not to buffer
