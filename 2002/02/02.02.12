08:05:43 <creichen> Hi!
08:06:45 <creichen> Does anyone here happen to know where I can get the source files needed for an unregisterized build of a recent version of ghc (the *.hc files) from?
08:07:31 <Heffalump> creichen: it's on the GHC web site
08:08:48 <creichen> Are you certain about that? The last time I checked, I only found files specific to IA32 (x86).
08:09:09 <creichen> That's what the label said, anyway, so I didn't try them...
08:09:52 <Heffalump> ah, ok. Porting GHC is a significant effort.
08:09:57 <Heffalump> What do you want to compile it on?
08:10:07 <Heffalump> (not that I actually can help)
08:10:07 <creichen> Alpha/Linux (Debian Sid).
08:10:16 <Heffalump> I suggest you ask on the GHC mailing list
08:10:41 <cuelebre> http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/
08:10:46 <creichen> It works on Linux, and it works on OSF/1, so I guess there's even a chance that it won't require too many changes...
08:12:36 <Heffalump> do the same hc files work on both?
08:13:48 <creichen> cuelebre: Isn't that just the normal CVS tree? Are the hcs in there somewhere?
08:14:49 <creichen> Heffalump: Ken Shan no longer has the old hc files, so I haven't tried them. However, those from a build that does not use platform-specific optimizations/features should work (particularly from Debian/x86, I'd guess).
08:15:18 <Heffalump> right
08:15:36 <Heffalump> I tried to build ghc 4.08.2 on Sparc/Linux a week or so ago but the binary I got didn't actually work
08:15:44 <Heffalump> I didn't have time to investigate further
08:16:29 <creichen> Did you do an unregisterized build?
08:16:40 <creichen> Well, yes, or it should've broken.
08:17:08 <creichen> You wouldn't happen to still have the hc files around somewhere?
08:18:02 <Heffalump> I got them from the web page
08:18:09 <Heffalump> but they were specifically Sparc HC files, IIRC
08:18:16 <creichen> Hmm, OK.
08:18:21 <Heffalump> I went for 4.08.2 because there weren't any for 5.x
08:19:14 <creichen> I tried to generate them on SuSE/x86 (using the script referenced on http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~atze/Programming/GHC/README-ghc.html), but the second stage failed because of some of the compiled programs segfaulting mindlessly.
08:20:40 <creichen> Ken Shan did his build with 5.00.2 on Linux/x86, so this seems like a good starting point... I won't have access to a decent x86 machine before the weekend, though.
08:21:13 <Heffalump> hmm :/
08:21:17 <Heffalump> got to go, sorry
08:21:31 <creichen> Heffalump: Are you in IRC here regularly? I could make them available if I succeed...
08:21:45 <creichen> (In case you still want to build on Sparc/Linux)
08:27:05 <shapr> creichen: yes, we're always here
08:27:25 <shapr> and please make them available if you succeed, I'm sure the current ghc5 maintainer would love to get an NMU alpha version
08:31:33 <creichen> OK, will do that (in case I succeed). I can't do an NMU, but the ghc5 maintainer is optimistic about being able to get the package to auto-build with a working ghc binary
08:31:59 <shapr> er, michaelw, right?
08:32:46 <shapr> well, in any case, I'm going home
08:32:58 <creichen> michaelw, right.
08:33:05 <shapr> work is over for the day
08:48:16 <creichen> Bye!
13:11:43 <tmoertel> Logan: did you do the Trucking problem?
15:25:06 <Logan> tmoertel: No, didn't bother (fortunately no one bothered during practice either :P).
15:25:35 <tmoertel> I was wondering about your opinion of the problem statement.
15:26:05 <tmoertel> In particular whether it was possible to receive input that didn't fully specify routes.
15:26:22 <tmoertel> My interpretation was that, no, it wasn't possible.
15:27:07 <Logan> I didn't really read it that closely.
19:45:34 <kholmes> is somebody awake?
