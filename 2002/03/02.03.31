08:40:55 <jcore> is there a common extension to append to haskell source file names:
08:40:56 <jcore> ?
08:44:46 <Igloo> .hs or .lhs depending on whether or not it is a literate script
08:45:09 <jcore> what exactly is a literate script?
08:46:12 <Igloo> If you're not starting code lines with > or surrounding code with \begin{code}...\end{code} you're not writing literate scripts
08:46:38 <jcore> ok, thanks
