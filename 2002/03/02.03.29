07:16:52 <Logan> Can anyone point me to a good list for the motivations for haskell's creation?
07:42:32 <Logan> Or, even better, a list of influences on haskell's design?
07:43:40 <Heffalump> Miranda and Gofer, certainly
07:47:53 <Logan> Miranda was the non-strict language?
07:47:57 <Logan> I know ML had a heavy influence.
07:47:59 <Logan> Haven't heard of Gofer.
07:49:39 <Logan> "The Gofer system provides an interpreter for a small language based closely on the current version of the Haskell report."
07:49:46 <Logan> Seems more like haskell influenced gofer, not the other way around.
07:50:32 <Heffalump> ah, ok
07:50:37 <Heffalump> I wasn't sure about the order
07:50:49 <Heffalump> well, ML was the first functional language
07:50:56 <Heffalump> Miranda was/is non-strict, yes
07:51:18 <Logan> I thought lisp was the first. :P
07:51:53 <Heffalump> lisp isn't really a functional language
07:52:06 <Logan> Because it's not pure?
07:53:11 <Heffalump> ML isn't pure either, but lisp sort of lacks functions
07:53:48 <Heffalump> I guess that's a bit unfair really :-)
07:53:53 <Logan> Heh.
07:54:05 <Logan> I think of lisp as a hack that loosely resembles what functional programming can be. :P
07:54:26 <Heffalump> :-)
07:55:17 <Logan> I have to give a presentation wiht someone in my programming languages class on some language, so I thought haskell would be perfect, since it kicks ass yet few people know of it.
07:55:32 <Logan> The problem is that there's way too much stuff to talk about, even when jus tgiving an introduction of the language.
07:55:51 <Logan> And I don't even know half of what there is to know.
07:56:05 <Heffalump> how much time do you have?
07:56:40 <Logan> Heh, 20 minutes.
07:56:48 <Heffalump> hmmm....
07:57:00 <Heffalump> don't waste much time on the history then
07:57:09 <Logan> I wasn't intending to.
07:57:37 <Logan> But part of the idea of this presentation is supposed to be to present some of the goals of the language and how it approaches them.
07:57:53 <Logan> I suppose mentioning the influences is unnecessary.
07:57:53 <Heffalump> right
07:57:56 <Heffalump> yeah
07:58:01 <Logan> I'm just brainstorming right now.
07:58:17 <Logan> I have so much stuff written down about the type system alone.
07:58:29 <Logan> I don't know how I can do it justice in 20 minutes.
07:58:49 <Heffalump> you can't
07:59:07 <Logan> And then there is stuff like syntax, non-strictness, patterns, comprehensions, etc. that ought to be mentioned.
07:59:14 <Heffalump> give a few examples that emphasise how easy it is to write concise programs
07:59:17 <Logan> Another group did ML a few weeks ago, and really sucked at it.
07:59:22 <Logan> Yeah.
07:59:27 <Heffalump> and make use of higher-order functions, pattern matching and laziness
07:59:52 <Logan> I guess I can focus on how it applies to generic programming: lazy evaluation, function composition, and type polymorphism.
08:04:03 <Logan> And currying, gotta mention currying, since the professor explicitly mentioned he wanted a good discussion about currying from the fpl groups. :P
08:05:43 <Heffalump> :-)
