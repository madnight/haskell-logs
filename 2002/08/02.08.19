00:10:13 <Jii> hi shae?
00:10:27 <shapr> hi Jii!
00:10:40 <shapr> what's up?
00:10:52 <Jii> how's the week starting? still with that enterprise/beans stuff?
00:11:03 <Jii> i am trying to wake up :)
00:11:09 <shapr> yah, still having bean indigestion.
00:11:31 <Jii> they make one fart
00:11:42 <shapr> yup :-)
00:12:25 <shapr> Jii: hey, check this out when you have time: http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/writings/peval/index.html
00:13:29 <Jii> humh was that on lambda the ultimate too?
00:14:34 <shapr> yah, it is.
00:15:01 <shapr> Darius told me he'd written that, and I argued that Haskell already did partial evaluation.
00:15:30 <shapr> that's how my recent discussion/questions on partial evaluation vs partial application came about.
00:16:22 <Jii> yah ok
00:16:32 <lament> Isn't partial evaluation the same as currying?
00:17:00 <shapr> I think partial application and currying are related
00:17:40 <shapr> partial evaluation appears to be about really simplifying part of the 'equation' when you get the chance.
00:17:51 <shapr> lament: I've been wrong about this before though.
00:21:48 <shapr> from the discussions we've had here before, I've gotten the impression that currying and partial application are either the same, or very closely related
00:22:14 <shapr> but that partial evaluation isn't necessarily included with partial application/currying
00:28:18 <Heffalump> morning.
00:28:51 <shapr> g'mornin Heffalump
00:34:12 <Heffalump> currying is partial application
00:35:20 <shapr> ok, so currying == partial application
00:35:29 <shapr> but, currying /= partial evaluation
00:38:55 <Heffalump> yeah
00:48:41 * shapr laughs
00:48:50 <shapr> that's an error message from Hex
00:49:06 <shapr> the computer coalesced by the famous Ponder Stibbons.
01:18:22 <shapr> hi pesco
01:22:58 <shapr> cool, Oege De Moor wrote a book with Bird
01:24:43 <pesco> hey shapr, long time no see
01:24:48 <shapr> what's up?
01:39:00 <shapr> ah well, time to work..
02:05:23 <delYsid> morning
02:36:33 <pesco> exit
02:36:42 <pesco> oeh. wrong window.
11:40:23 <Heffalump> hmm, s'all quiet, and I know you're not all at AFP :-)
12:44:40 <Igloo> More to the piont, shouldn't all the AFPers be online by now?  :-)
12:46:52 <hornby> wuzza afp? 
12:48:04 <dandelion-> advanced functional programmer?
12:54:08 <Igloo> Advanced Functional Programming (Summer School thereof)
12:56:19 <Igloo> http://www.functional-programming.org/afp/afp4/ if you want to see what you're missing  :-)
12:57:31 * pesco yawns
12:57:37 <pesco> Moin, what's up?
13:02:50 <dandelion-> the haskell wish list archive is not being maintained anymore and is down
13:02:55 <dandelion-> hm
13:06:34 <Igloo> What's that, a wishlist for new language features?
13:06:54 <dandelion-> yes
13:07:15 <dandelion-> there is a link to it on www.haskell.org -> the future of haskell
13:21:31 <Heffalump> igloo: well, chillix gave the impression he wouldn't be, I dunno if hdaume brought a laptop, and jadrian is probably only just arriving
13:22:01 <Igloo> cv
13:22:21 <Heffalump> once chillix gets an ethernet cable of his own he might come on :-)
