02:59:21 <jadrian> hi
03:24:44 <jadrian> hi
04:26:15 <jadrian> back
04:26:33 <Jerub> hi
04:29:05 <jadrian> hi Jerub
05:43:51 <dark> Hmpf, I can't start a comment with --== to make ascii art :)
05:48:46 <Jii> hehe
05:55:17 <dark> Hmm, does that mean --== would be a valid identifier?
05:55:21 <dark> I wonder what I could use it for :)
05:56:08 <Jii> don't wonder, wonder something more constructive ;-)
05:56:31 <dark> Jii: You mean, like :--==?
05:59:37 <Jii> i mean, like, thinking whether human computation is turing-complete ;-)
06:03:46 <Jerub> the lookahead required for  -- comments is funky
06:03:59 <Jerub> funky -> absurd to the point a better comment delimited should be used from a lanugage design pov.
06:10:31 <dark> Jii: Human computation doesn't have access to infinite memory :)
06:15:35 <dark> Jerub: Or different rules, such as that -- always starts a comment :)
06:17:10 <dark> Speaking of funky, I now have a function with four fromIntegrals in it, in order to convert an unsigned byte to a signed byte, then do Word32 computation on it, and return the result as an Integer.
06:18:10 <dark> GHC's integer types are nice but sometimes they get on my nerves :)
06:18:10 <Jii> dark, yes but human computation might have some special attribute that we don't yet know of ;-)
06:19:52 <dark> Jii: I've seen no evidence of it so far :)  Our amazing ability to detect truth where formal algorithms fail is also our amazing ability to write buggy code while thinking it's correct.
06:22:06 <Jii> i haven't seen either, but still i think it is an interesting question per se :)
06:22:30 <Jii> what's your connection to finland btw? i recall you being on htv.fi?
06:23:03 <dark> Jii: Yes, in fact I should still be.  I guess the nameserver is down again.
06:23:07 <dark> Jii: I live in Helsinki :)
06:25:15 <dark> Jii: I moved here early in 2000 to work for Wapit.  I stayed after the bankruptcy.
06:27:59 <dark> Hmm I wish there were a way to temporarily add "deriving Show" to everything, for debugging.
06:30:40 <Igloo> I tend to derive Show on all my datastructures
06:30:55 <Igloo> Otherwise just using hugs is a PITA
06:31:10 <dark> Igloo: How expensive is it to do that?
06:31:43 <Jii> dark, so you know people like jari juslin, antti brax, lars wirzenius, and alike?
06:32:04 <dark> Jii: Yep.  The second only by name :)
06:32:08 <Igloo> I wouldn't have thought it makes a difference, but then again, deriving Read and something else is supposed to be slow but I don't know why
06:32:47 <Igloo> I'd have thought it would just result in unused code being generated
06:33:10 <dark> Igloo: I guess I can test it :)
06:34:34 <Jii> dark, i study at helsinki university dept. of computer science, a lot of people who studied there worked at wapit
06:35:28 <Jii> (you probably know that, yes ;-)
06:35:35 <dark> Jii: ... and are members of Alter Ego :)
06:36:17 <Jii> yes :)
06:37:29 <Jii> and now you're married to a finnish girl and decided to live here? ;)
06:38:34 <dark> Yes :)
06:38:56 <dark> Well, the marriage is planned for next year, and I don't know how long we'll stay.
06:39:41 <dark> I'm fairly sure the finnish government has an active genetic exchange program, and uses finnish girls to lure in foreigners.
06:40:45 <dark> I mean, it's not just people who come here, like me, but finnish girls are sent out to foreign universities to bring back men.
06:41:04 <Jii> heh
06:44:47 <dark> Yikes.  I just found out that all my statement generators had had their arguments reversed :)  I didn't notice until I tested a jump expression, which came up with "if (31428) then goto (%zf != 0)"
06:45:34 <dark> I guess I'm still not used to list-based programming.
06:47:06 * Heffalump appears
06:47:42 <dark> By the way, is there a standard algorithm for printing an expression tree with minimal parentheses?  I don't want to spend time on reinventing one :)
06:50:45 <Jii> i don't know
06:52:28 <Jii> i still haven't attended the course on compilers ;-)
06:53:07 <jadrian> back
06:53:26 <Heffalump> hello
06:53:32 <jadrian> hello Heffalump!
06:53:40 <Heffalump> Jeremy is making efforts to make it possible to use the lab computers in the evening, but he's not sure yet
06:53:46 * jadrian 's getting his stuff ready for tomorrow
06:54:11 <Heffalump> but there's also a computer room in the place you'll be staying I think you'll be able to use at any time, though again I'm not sure
06:54:11 <jadrian> oh you saw my question!
06:54:13 <jadrian> that would be cool
06:54:15 <Heffalump> the lab is Sparc/Solaris, the computer room is Win2K
06:54:27 <jadrian> argh... 
06:54:29 <jadrian> :)
06:54:49 <jadrian> I think I'll manage to finish my stuff today though.
06:54:49 <Jii> w2k is nice enough
06:54:59 <jadrian> well I'm working in LaTeX
06:55:26 <jadrian> most win2k boxes don't have LaTeX installed...
06:55:33 <Jii> that is very true
06:55:36 <jadrian> but it's not really that important
06:55:46 <Igloo> You don't have somewhere you can SSH to?
06:55:49 <Jii> i haven't used latex on any windows boxes, if i recall correctly
06:56:21 <jadrian> Igloo: yeap that would be fine too
06:56:28 <jadrian> Igloo: ssh and then vi
06:58:43 <jadrian> by the way I'm arriving at about 16h30 at Heathrow tomorrow, so I'll probably arrive at Oxford after Graham Huttons introduction to functional programming
06:58:43 <Igloo> I got the impression that wasn't unusual
06:59:14 <jadrian> are you planning anything for after that class?
06:59:44 <jadrian> I mean, I'll report to the lodge when I arrive... and then...
07:00:56 <jadrian> should I meet the rest of the people some where, or is everyone on their own after that class?
07:01:09 <Heffalump> they might have Exceed
07:01:24 <Heffalump> I think the second registration session is 6pm-7pm
07:01:44 <jadrian> Exceed? what's that?
07:01:49 <Heffalump> I'm not sure if there are meals that night, but you're not having meals anyway
07:01:54 <Heffalump> X-windows server for 'doze
07:02:00 <jadrian> ah
07:02:09 <Heffalump> s'quite good
07:03:33 <jadrian> yeap, I've just been to some summer schools (here in Portugal) where after the classes they'd all get together to get to know the local area and that kind of stuff...
07:04:15 <Heffalump> does your plane land at 16h30?
07:04:35 <jadrian> I hope so :)
07:04:50 <jadrian> well I hope it lands...
07:04:55 <jadrian> yeap 16h35 I think
07:04:55 <Heffalump> hmm, so by the time you're on a bus it'll be closer to 17h30.
07:05:30 <jadrian> hmm 1 hour to get a bus...
07:05:32 <Heffalump> so more like 19h00 by the time you're in Oxford
07:06:12 <Heffalump> well, you have to pick up luggage
07:06:12 <jadrian> yeap
07:06:12 <Heffalump> and find the bus station and stuff (it's not too hard to find but Heathrow is quite big)
07:06:12 <jadrian> i see...
07:06:42 <jadrian> by the way you all and dinner really early there right?
07:06:54 <Heffalump> s/and/have/ ?
07:07:04 <jadrian> opss
07:07:08 <jadrian> yes
07:07:31 <Heffalump> I eat sometime between 7 and 10 usually
07:07:39 <Heffalump> I dunno about other people :-)
07:07:42 <jadrian> ah ok
07:08:12 <jadrian> so it's not that hard to get a meal at about 8-9pm at a pub is it?
07:08:33 <Igloo> I tend to eat nearer mignight, but that's because I eat lunch at about 7 when my girlfriend gets back from work
07:08:57 <Igloo> Pubs tend to stop serving food at 9 if they are foody pubs
07:09:13 <jadrian> ah
07:09:20 <Igloo> Less foody ones stop earlier
07:09:23 * Igloo disappears
07:09:25 <dark> Microwave pizza.
07:09:27 <jadrian> lol
07:09:39 <Heffalump> do you like Chinese food?
07:09:49 <jadrian> yeap
07:09:58 <jadrian> well I can eat anything when I'm hugry!
07:09:59 <jadrian> :))
07:10:04 <Heffalump> There's a place called Wok 23 on the same road as the college (towards the centre of town) that's quite cheap
07:10:45 <jadrian> Just hope it is still open when I get there... :)
07:11:08 <Heffalump> I think it should be
07:11:15 <dark> Is it a front for the Illuminati?
07:11:29 <Heffalump> if you're desperate there's always McDonalds/Burger King/Kentucky Fried Chicken, in the centre of town
07:12:10 <jadrian> not my favourite kind of food... but yes it is an option :)
07:14:26 <Heffalump> those should be open until 11
07:14:26 <jadrian> Heffalump: you said something about registration,
07:14:26 <jadrian> <Heffalump> I think the second registration session is 6pm-7pm
07:14:26 <Heffalump> you can also register on Tuesday morning
07:14:38 <jadrian> I see before the classes
07:15:06 <jadrian> omg, 9'clock... :)
07:15:19 <Heffalump> yeah :(
07:15:35 <Heffalump> for 5 days in a row :(
07:15:47 <jadrian> well then another 5 in the next week!
07:16:27 <jadrian> in August...
07:17:25 <jadrian> are the labs easy to find? 
07:17:44 <Heffalump> -ish
07:17:54 <Heffalump> you'll need us to show you the way the first couple of times
07:18:58 <Heffalump> do you like stairs? :-)
07:18:58 <jadrian> yeap (likes to exercise) :)
07:18:58 <Heffalump> ok, the lab is on the 6th floor :-)
07:18:58 <Heffalump> (there is a lift)
07:19:12 <jadrian> I go to the 6th floor of my dept. all the time by stairs... :)
07:19:26 * Heffalump disappears, biaw (or see you tomorrow - if you get horribly lost in Oxford give me a ring on 07968 253467)
07:19:45 <jadrian> ok!
07:19:59 <jadrian> see you 
07:21:21 <jadrian> I got to get some work done
07:21:22 <jadrian> bye!
07:52:23 <dark> Ewww, he said "work"
