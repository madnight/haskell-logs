01:31:11 <delYsid> When does icfp start?
01:32:28 <jewel> 12:00 Noon Pacific Standard Time on Friday August 30, 2002, until 12:00 Noon Monday September 2, 2002
01:32:35 <jewel> the competition that is
01:33:23 <Jerub> is it a group comp? or singletons? or arbitary size groups?
01:36:06 <jewel> I think you can enter as a group 
01:36:12 <jewel> dunno if there is a limit though
01:36:31 <Jerub> its tempting.
01:36:37 <Jerub> even though I'm a strict haskell amateur
01:36:47 <jewel> Players may enter alone or as teams of any size. 
01:36:58 <jewel> so am I
03:04:39 <pesco> Yeehah, I'm raytracing!
03:05:04 * pesco stares at numbers whizzling by.
08:10:03 <jewel> shapr: hello
09:27:50 <jewel> shapr: won't be around tonight, talk to you tomorrow
10:44:24 <Heffalump> 'lo
11:01:49 * Igloo pines for sub-datatypes
11:02:08 <Heffalump> what for?
11:02:47 <Igloo> So I can get warning free compilatino without having extra cases on loads of functions that just give errors
11:03:07 <Heffalump> ah.
11:03:17 <Heffalump> surely you should have a separate type in that situation then?
11:03:47 <Igloo> But then I have to invent yet more type constructors for the same thing
11:04:38 <Igloo> The particular instance is a datatype that has Text, PatVar and Var constructors and I flatten the Vars out before a huge number of functions
11:06:31 <Heffalump> huh?
11:07:21 <Igloo> [Text "foo", PatVar 3, Var "FOO"] -> [Text "foo", PatVar 3, Text "Whatever variable FOO was"]
11:07:31 <Heffalump> ah, ok
15:41:18 <dark> Hmm... are there ncurses bindings for Haskell?
15:41:30 <dark> As foreign functions, I mean.
15:42:59 <dark> Normal curses bindings would be fine, too :)
15:46:16 <Heffalump> igloo wrote some, I think
15:48:52 <Igloo> I have some directly mapped bindings for a subset of curses, yes
15:49:57 <Igloo> They're still a mess, but http://c93.keble.ox.ac.uk/~ian/Curses.hsc
15:50:38 <Igloo> "hsc2hs -o Curses.lhs Curses.hsc -L -lcurses" should give you a Haskell script
16:24:48 <dark> Igloo: Thanks.  I can use it as an example :)
16:25:00 <dark> I haven't done anything with the FFI yet.
16:25:40 <dark> Hmm, it's not a problem that some of these functions are macros?
16:27:10 <Igloo> It all worked with ncurses. I haven't looked at things like that the possibility of them being macros and whether it would break things yet
16:29:45 <dark> A big problem I ran into when making curses bindings for Java was that including curses.h would pull in many macros that would break the identifiers I was trying to define (such as "lines" and "columns")
