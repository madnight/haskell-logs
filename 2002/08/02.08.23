00:00:06 <Pseudonym> I don't know.  Probably not.
00:00:14 * Pseudonym has a family
00:00:27 <jens> so do I...
00:00:47 <hornby> You don't need a lot of people, just good people
00:01:01 <jens> indeed
00:01:04 <Pseudonym> True.
00:38:18 <Pseudonym> Bye all.  Have a good weekend.
01:15:39 * shapr bounces
01:57:02 * shapr bounces
02:04:31 * hornby bounces along
02:07:23 <shapr> hi hornby, what's up?
02:08:30 <hornby> thinking about jobs
02:08:37 <shapr> you looking for one?
02:08:47 <hornby> just looking for the future :)
02:09:00 <hornby> they are very demanding
02:09:17 <hornby> very few entry level positions. 
02:09:31 <shapr> what does demanding mean?
02:09:34 <hornby> the skills sets the demand are vast and varied. 
02:10:36 <hornby> very depressing :)
02:10:40 <shapr> newtype JobAdvert = Requirements [Skill]
02:11:00 * shapr wonders if that's legal for a type constructor
02:11:05 <shapr> I need to read up on type constructors
02:11:14 <hornby> heh
02:11:29 <hornby> and of course there are no Haskell jobs ;)
02:11:40 <shapr> hornby: you could write a Haskell program to figure out what the largest number of jobs are asking for.
02:11:42 <shapr> then you could learn that.
02:11:49 <shapr> for step 2
02:11:50 <hornby> C++, Java. 
02:11:59 <hornby> but also lots of obscure shit
02:12:03 <shapr> you could make a time based derivative
02:12:18 <hornby> specific tools, etc. 
02:12:20 <shapr> and then come up with what is most likely to have an upswing
02:12:22 <hornby> heh
02:12:55 <hornby> have it chart progress over time, extrapolate to the future. throw in some analysis of reviews, projections, press releases, etc. 
02:12:58 <shapr> then you could post that on your website.
02:13:08 <shapr> at which point HR departments around the world would try to hire you.
02:13:21 <shapr> ;-)
02:13:34 <hornby> I don't understand how anyone gets hired
02:13:48 <shapr> It seems to happen to me accidentally.
02:14:06 <hornby> Everyone in the industry seems to be a tireless demi-god
02:14:12 <shapr> no way
02:14:16 <shapr> most programmers suck
02:14:21 <shapr> you do not suck.
02:14:39 <shapr> therefore, you need to meet the people in the physical area, and industry area in which you would like to be hired.
02:14:59 <shapr> if you want to work in the area where you are living, join the user's groups
02:15:05 <hornby> so instead of playing on a buzzword laden resume, I should network :)
02:15:08 <shapr> show up at installfests, etc etc
02:15:12 <shapr> that's my opinion.
02:15:21 <shapr> you know I love talking :-)
02:15:26 <hornby> seems like a good idea. heh
02:15:28 <shapr> that's gotten me more jobs than anything else.
02:15:43 <hornby> what if you want to land a job in a different country? ;)
02:15:58 <shapr> several different routes to that
02:16:14 <shapr> first, learn as much about the language and culture as you can do from a distance
02:16:21 <shapr> then, spend some time there on a tourist visa
02:16:32 <shapr> if you can arrange to hang out with people while you're there, so much the better
02:16:40 <hornby> Sounds expensive. :)
02:16:59 <shapr> not necessarily. you're a student, so you can live at hostels
02:17:08 <hornby> I was thinking that it would be awesome to try working in Japan or something for a few years. 
02:17:11 <shapr> plus you learn a lot more about a place from a hostel than at a hotel
02:17:23 <shapr> you know Yosomono on #python?
02:17:26 <hornby> yeah :)
02:17:28 <hornby> well, sorta
02:17:42 <hornby> he's one of the things that sparked my interest :)
02:17:46 <shapr> talk to him about it, see what he has to say.
02:17:58 <shapr> I know that jens is living in .jp
02:18:07 <hornby> neat
02:18:11 <shapr> see what he has to say.
02:18:34 <hornby> awesome. course I'm thinking many years down the road now
02:18:48 <shapr> why wait?
02:18:48 <hornby> I think I should finish this whole school thing. 
02:19:40 <hornby> I know a lot of people without degrees are getting jobs, or where, but I still think its a good idea :) 
02:19:55 <hornby> er were
02:21:30 <hornby> Hrmph, and I gotta stop playing so much chess and start studying more
02:22:06 <shapr> I don't have a degree
02:22:25 <hornby> yeah, but you're cooler than me :)
02:22:44 <shapr> only because I've had a few extra years to work on it.
02:23:05 <hornby> aha, well at least you admit it ;)
02:23:23 <shapr> what, that I'm a bit older?
02:23:41 <hornby> that you're cooler than me :) anyway ... 
02:23:45 <shapr> I would argue that you learn faster than I do, so you'll catch up quickly if you work on it.
02:23:47 <shapr> ;-)
02:24:18 <hornby> Well. I think that finishing this degree is the way to go, for me, personally
02:24:41 <shapr> and after that, explore the world?
02:24:43 <hornby> For many reasons. Social, political (ie, family), etc. 
02:24:51 <hornby> shapr: hope so. 
02:25:13 <shapr> I'd suggest you start exploring your options now.
02:25:32 <shapr> that way you can set it up ahead of time and be prepared to explore the world :-)
02:25:35 <hornby> Well, I have these outrageous fantasies :) Like working overseas
02:26:01 <hornby> Everyone else I know either doesn't dream, or dreams small
02:26:02 <shapr> since I'm doing that, it doesn't seem so outrageous to me.
02:26:08 <shapr> yah, I know that feeling.
02:26:42 <hornby> Right, no one around here is doing anything cool like that (sort of by definition I guess, but you know what I mean)
02:27:06 <shapr> I first spoke to Bea... three months or so before I flew across the sea to move in with her.
02:27:11 <shapr> my family flipped out
02:27:20 <hornby> All the women my age I know want to be either housewifes or teachers, and the guys have no direction at all 
02:27:46 <hornby> Bit of a shock to them, I guess :)
02:27:48 <shapr> many of my acquaintances said "wow, I wish I could move overseas." My response was "You can."
02:28:22 <hornby> there are so many issues though :) 
02:28:33 <shapr> like what?
02:28:37 <hornby> 1. How to get started? Its not common, nor common knowledge 
02:28:46 <shapr> get started on what?
02:28:59 <hornby> well, anything, but for example, living overseas :)
02:29:31 <shapr> 1. pay off your debts 2. save up some cash 3. buy a plane ticket
02:29:39 <hornby> 2. Risk. Of failure in various forms, including financial
02:29:52 <shapr> that's always present.
02:29:55 <shapr> no matter where you live.
02:30:51 <hornby> So when you flew out, did you have a job lined up? Or did you just jump into the dark? 
02:30:52 <shapr> there are various legalities that could make your life more difficult if you don't prepare for them ahead of time.
02:31:09 <shapr> I just jumped.
02:31:19 <shapr> but then, I have years of experience doing that =)
02:31:38 <hornby> I guess you get used to it. 
02:31:49 <shapr> it's always scary, but it's great fun.
02:31:52 <hornby> heh
02:32:00 <hornby> bit of a rush I suppose :) 
02:32:07 <hornby> what sort of legalities? 
02:32:08 <shapr> yah, it is.
02:32:19 <shapr> sometimes too much of a rush.. it gets addictive.
02:32:27 <hornby> sometimes you jump when you shouldn't? 
02:32:34 <shapr> whenever I've been living in a place for a year or so, I feel the urge to move again.
02:33:11 <shapr> legalities such as: employment of non-citizens in a certain country usually requires a special permit.
02:33:28 <hornby> yeah, how did you swing that anyway? 
02:33:38 <shapr> I got around that by being the significant other of a European citizen.
02:33:46 <hornby> sneaky :)
02:34:46 <shapr> sweden, finland, etc all have websites where you can go to see the requirements for getting a job there.
02:34:54 <shapr> most likely japan does also.
02:35:09 <hornby> probably. hrm
02:35:18 <shapr> if japan does not, canada will have a website where they tell you about the relations between .ca and .jp
02:35:55 <hornby> I guess all the information is there really. 
02:36:04 <shapr> yup
02:36:09 <shapr> you just gotta go get it.
02:36:41 <hornby> Its just a matter of doing the research, and then having the moxie to deal with all those little details you never had a clue about
02:37:07 <hornby> Ah, moxie. An ugly word, but I like what it means. 
02:37:09 <shapr> that's right.
02:37:19 <shapr> moxie == chutzpah == bravado ?
02:37:29 <hornby> ya, pretty much. 
02:37:31 <hornby>  1. energy; pep.
02:37:34 <hornby> 2. courage, determination.
02:37:38 <hornby>  3. Know-how, expertise.
02:37:55 <shapr> determination is my favorite
02:38:15 <shapr> hi kisu
02:38:20 <kisu> hi
02:38:44 <shapr> are you looking for Haskell info? or are you an experienced user of Haskell?
02:39:22 <kisu> looking for , lol I am a beginner
02:39:52 <shapr> do you have experience in other functional languages?
02:39:59 <shapr> are you looking for online docs or book references?
02:40:23 <kisu> umm nope i've never experienced in functional languages...
02:40:27 <hornby> oh wow, jobsinjapan.com
02:41:06 <kisu> i live in south korea, so i can't get good reference book in haskell
02:41:17 <kisu> except online docs :-)
02:41:39 <shapr> ok
02:41:47 <shapr> my first suggestion would be the YAHT tutorial
02:41:53 * shapr looks for the url
02:41:57 <kisu> cool thx
02:42:13 <kisu> shapr u're good@haskell?
02:42:42 <shapr> I'm passable.
02:42:50 <shapr> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/
02:43:09 <kisu> thx for the url
02:43:18 <shapr> there's lots of good stuff available here also: http://www.haskell.org/bookshelf/
02:43:21 <kisu> where r u @?
02:43:22 <hornby> shapr is a haskell demi-god in training
02:43:29 <shapr> hornby: I am?
02:43:31 <shapr> cool!
02:43:36 <shapr> kisu: I'm in finland.
02:43:46 <kisu> oh cool u know korea?
02:44:36 <shapr> I've heard of it :-)
02:44:41 <shapr> I've never been there.
02:44:59 <kisu> i c...yup korea held worldcup 2k2
02:45:00 <kisu> lol
02:45:34 <kisu> in finland, university teach haskell?
02:45:39 <shapr> hornby: I just wanna be a better programmer. FP is one step in that direction.
02:45:55 <shapr> kisu: I think several universities here teach Haskell.
02:46:17 <shapr> kisu: I'm 30, and I've been living here 3 years. I'm from Alabama, USA originally.
02:46:32 <kisu> ok..cool
02:47:06 <kisu> ruby 4 2k1, haskell 4 2k2
02:47:28 <shapr> nifty :-)
02:47:34 <hornby> that is pretty cool
02:47:35 <shapr> for me, mercury 4 2k3
02:48:07 <kisu> what's mercury?
02:48:23 <shapr> mercury is claimed to be the successor to Prolog.
02:48:38 <shapr> C, Java, Python,  Ruby --> procedural
02:48:42 <kisu> yup
02:48:45 <shapr> Haskell, OCaml --> functional
02:48:56 <shapr> Prolog, Mercury --> logic/constraint
02:49:03 <kisu> yeah
02:50:13 <kisu> so shapr r u a developer?
02:50:33 <shapr> if you mean, a programmer who gets paid to program, then, yes.
02:50:42 <kisu> i c
02:50:47 <shapr> what about you?
02:50:56 <kisu> a sophomore in CS
02:51:05 <shapr> nice
02:51:13 <kisu> sorry junior lol
02:51:34 <kisu> i learned c, c++, java, python
02:51:55 <kisu> now i'm interested in ruby, haskell, c#
02:52:07 * hornby is jealous
02:52:12 <shapr> I know java and python.
02:52:14 <shapr> I like Python.
02:52:19 * hornby curses his schools comp. sci. program
02:52:28 <kisu> yup python is cool
02:53:00 <kisu> what kinda OS do u use?
02:53:07 <shapr> emacs
02:53:10 <shapr> :)
02:53:33 <kisu> oh i mean sth like m$ windog or linux , lol
02:53:41 <kisu> of course u will gonna use linux lol
02:53:42 * shapr reads http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~paull/cs1011/inbuilt.html
02:53:51 <shapr> that's true, I prefer Linux.
02:53:59 <shapr> I use debian/unstable
02:54:21 <kisu> yup me in gentoo & winxp
02:55:08 <shapr> I remember noticing words and unwords and then asking for something where I can specify my own split character, but I don't remember what the answer was.
02:56:41 * shapr reads http://www.cs.uu.nl/~afie/haskell/tourofprelude.html
02:57:43 <hornby> neat
02:58:03 <hornby> mmm, I think I can finally sleep now
02:58:03 <shapr> any p xs = or (map p xs)
02:58:06 <shapr> that's how any is defined
02:58:09 <shapr> is that lazy?
02:58:13 <shapr> hmm
02:59:06 <hornby> shapr: anyway, thanks for the brain cycles. g'night :)
02:59:16 <shapr> sure, g'night
02:59:46 * shapr tries to figure out how to test for lazy evaluation in that any definition.
04:55:26 <shapr> yay, my functional data structures book arrived!
05:01:05 <Igloo> It should be lazy
05:01:47 <Igloo> The way to test is to try evaluationg any p xs for some list xs with an undefined value with a p that will return true on an earlier value
05:30:48 * Heffalump appears
08:14:28 <Heffalump> 'lo
08:37:32 * shapr bounces
08:38:09 <shapr> hi shreya
09:13:09 * shapr bounces
09:46:03 * shapr fights MetaEnvironment build system
10:34:55 <shapr> hi SamB
10:35:11 <Igloo> Why does it all have to be so *complicated*?
10:35:24 <shapr> Igloo: your make replacement?
10:35:55 <Igloo> Well, that too, but I was refering to trying to get a workinug hat
10:36:06 <shapr> oh
10:36:18 <shapr> Hat works, it's just really picky about the source it will work on.
10:36:38 <Igloo> Are you using the Debian packages of it?
10:36:48 <Igloo> And if so, what versino of hat, nhc98 and ghc do you have?
10:36:49 <shapr> no way
10:36:56 <shapr> the deb is limited to nhc
10:36:59 <shapr> so I built my own.
10:37:10 <Igloo> I think I might have to do that
10:37:31 <Igloo> There is a ghc.tar.gz with the deb, but I assume it's specific to one version of GHC and there are no docs about it AFIACS
10:38:13 <Igloo> And AFAIK hat should work on a superset of Haskell '98, which is fine
10:40:01 <shapr> it has some strange problems.
10:42:22 <Igloo> Then report bugs  :-)
10:50:47 <shapr> I have
10:51:06 <Igloo> Grrr, hat thinks it is already installed
10:51:19 <Igloo> Or rather building hat tries to use hat from my nhc installation
10:54:55 <Igloo> Oh, no, it's trying to use it from teh builddirectory
11:43:53 <jewel> hey all
11:45:42 <shapr> hi jewel
11:45:43 <shapr> what's up?
11:46:12 <jewel> not much
11:47:55 <jewel> you?

11:49:49 <jewel> what's that?
11:50:01 <shapr> http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/
12:01:07 <pesco> ew, the lights flicker.
12:32:46 <dandelion-> are any type theorists present?
16:03:42 <Heffalump> hi
16:03:47 <shapr> hiya
16:06:17 <jleuner> hey shapr
16:06:45 <shapr> hi jleuner, what's up?
16:06:55 <jleuner> just heading to bed
16:06:58 <jleuner> must be late for you
16:07:16 <shapr> yah, it's 2am
16:07:29 <jleuner> will you be around tomorrow?
16:07:37 <shapr> yes, very much so
16:07:40 <shapr> will you?
16:07:47 <jleuner> yeah I'll go into the office
16:08:03 <shapr> want to practice haskell tomorrow?
16:08:04 <jleuner> and hopefully do some func coding
16:08:08 <jleuner> instead of playing go
16:08:12 <jleuner> yep yep
16:08:20 <shapr> spiffy!
16:08:38 <jleuner> we should do something collaborative
16:08:44 <shapr> yes, I agree.
16:09:27 <jleuner> see you tomorrow then
16:09:38 <jleuner> I'll probably be there in about 12 hours
16:09:43 <jleuner> or less
16:10:09 <shapr> ok!
16:10:15 <jleuner> ok, bye
17:26:50 <Peaker> What's the Haskell niche/field? Where is it often used?
17:29:54 <Heffalump> compilers :-)
17:30:17 <Heffalump> but it's really good for lots of tihngs
17:30:23 <Heffalump> s/tihngs/things/
17:32:58 <Peaker> The Static typing of Haskell seems cool, as well as the backtick/() to convert infix<->prefix and some other stuff.. Even the 'gentle' tutorials throw a lot of information at you though, and at least with hugs, working interactively seemed impossible
17:34:06 <Heffalump> what were your problems with hugs?
17:34:49 <Peaker> Heffalump: It seems that anything regarding type declarations/etc doesn't work in the interactive shell, and only when fed from a file
17:34:59 <Heffalump> oh, yes
17:35:07 <Heffalump> the interactive shell doesn't maintain any state
17:35:14 <Peaker> its annoying :)
17:35:17 <Heffalump> ghci is better that way
17:35:32 <Heffalump> but still, programs are intended to be dealt with "in toto", not really line by line
17:35:32 <Peaker> Debian package?
17:35:36 <Heffalump> ghc
17:35:40 <Heffalump> maybe ghc5
17:35:55 <Peaker> ghc5
17:36:03 <Heffalump> you can do let foo x = x + x
17:36:14 <Heffalump> you can do "let foo x = x + x" at the prompt there
17:36:55 <Peaker> ok.. one of these days I'm going to give Haskell a big shot.. Does the static typing system really cover all typical cases, or do you sometimes wish you could just cast it away?
17:37:15 <shapr> it works great
17:37:32 <Heffalump> there are some, rare, cases where it gets in the way
17:37:50 <Heffalump> but most of the time you have that wish it actually turns out your thinking was incorrect
17:38:28 <Peaker> I tried the "Gentle introduction to Haskell" tutorial but although it was comprehensible, it didn't seem Gentle by any means
17:38:43 <Heffalump> it's Gentler than other things around :-)
17:39:15 <Peaker> heh :)
17:41:09 <Heffalump> >> Our goal is to provide a gentle introduction to
17:41:09 <Heffalump> >> Haskell for someone who has experience with at least
17:41:09 <Heffalump> >> one other language, preferably a functional language
17:42:08 <Peaker> well, I have a tiny bit of experience with Scheme and some experience with functional-style programming with Python, and loads of experience with OO/imperative programming
17:45:59 <Heffalump> in many ways Haskell is the extreme example of functional-style programming (though that doesn't make it unusable as a language)
19:32:32 <engstad> ICFP start when?
19:37:53 <pnou_>  The contest will be held Friday, August 30, 2002 -- Monday, September 2, 2002. 
19:37:53 <pnou_> The problem will be posted right here on this web site, at 12:00 Noon (PDT) on August 30th and all entries must be received by 12:00 Noon (PDT) on the September 2nd. 
19:44:48 <engstad> Thanks.
19:45:33 <engstad> By the way, I find ghci easier to use than hugs.. In ghci I can 'let' things. Can I do the same in hugs?
19:45:41 <engstad> On the cmd line, that is.
23:30:12 <Chilli> Moin!
23:30:24 <Heffalump> :-)
23:30:33 <Chilli> :-)
23:30:36 * Heffalump objects strongly to mornings
23:30:48 <eivuokko> Heh ;)
23:30:51 <Chilli> Fair comment
23:31:04 <Chilli> but it will get really bad only when I am back down under
23:31:33 <Chilli> when my body thinks mornings are in the middle of the night....
23:31:42 <Heffalump> heh
23:31:44 * Chilli sighs deeply.
23:32:09 <Heffalump> I'm sure it's good for the soul or something
23:33:27 <Chilli> hmmm, I am not quite convinced...
23:37:58 <Chilli> not very busy here right now...
23:38:09 <Heffalump> it never is, is it?
