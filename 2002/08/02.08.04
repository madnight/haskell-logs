07:39:01 <delYsid> > evaluate = maximise . maptree static . gametree
07:39:16 <delYsid> Wow, btw, is there a Hchess.hs somehwere?
08:07:43 * shapr blinks
08:08:24 <delYsid> hi shapr
08:08:43 <shapr> hey delYsid, how ar ya?
08:08:48 <shapr> learned anything cool today?
08:08:56 <delYsid> fine, thanks
08:09:12 <delYsid> Did you make progress with Parsec yet in some way?
08:09:30 <shapr> nope, I haven't gotten back to it since the last time we spoke about it.
08:09:54 <shapr> I want to write a lojban parser. I think I need to start with simpler parsers though.
08:10:07 <delYsid> I'm wondering how I'm supposed to keep some kind of state in there...
08:10:21 <delYsid> http://212.17.102.236/Stunden.hs
08:11:11 <shapr> hm, nifty looking source
08:11:35 <shapr> iirc, haskell has readLines, or the equivalent
08:12:02 <delYsid> well, the idea with monadic parsing is to avoid those methinks.
08:12:14 <shapr> actually, I vaguely recall something like content or getContents method on a file handle
08:12:34 <delYsid> getContents returns a lazy string of the file, yes
08:12:39 <shapr> and then you can split at '\n' and map onto those lines
08:12:54 <delYsid> yeah, I could :)
08:13:12 <delYsid> but I want a parser which does that, so that my error messages have correct line numbers e.g.
08:13:36 <shapr> if you want to maintain a running total, then do it recursively, as in, pass the total to the next recursive call.
08:13:47 <shapr> I know you can use a state monad to do that automatically, but I don't know how that works.
08:13:55 <delYsid> yeah, that was what I was wondering about.
08:14:02 <shapr> I've seen demo code on the HaskellWiki but it's currently down :-(
08:14:11 <delYsid> can a Parsec Parser take an additional input argument...
08:14:15 <shapr> maybe you can google for some state monad examples?
08:15:12 <shapr> delYsid: heeey, have you seen Haskore? music composition in Haskell?
08:15:28 <delYsid> I've looked a bit at the tutorial.
08:15:28 <shapr> I don't know about additional arguments for Parsers...
08:15:34 <shapr> I'm sure it's possible, but I don't know how :-)
08:15:45 <delYsid> I'm impressed, but I'd rather also have some waveform composition functions.
08:16:34 <shapr> he seems to have a 'score' oriented view of music in Haskore
08:16:39 <shapr> I guess that's the reason for the name.
08:16:39 <delYsid> Writing a lazy waveform would be really cool.
08:16:42 <delYsid> any hints?
08:16:49 <shapr> for lazy waveforms?
08:16:59 <delYsid> yeah
08:17:08 <shapr> I've seen some Haskell DSP code on the 'net
08:17:14 <delYsid> yeah, where?
08:17:17 <shapr> I've saved a copy of that code just in case the site disappears..
08:17:27 <shapr> google pointed me to it...
08:17:29 <shapr> dsp + haskell
08:21:51 * shapr plugs a vacuum cleaner into the same powerstrip with three computers, and doesn't blow a circuit breaker!
08:22:06 * shapr vacuums his computers
08:25:38 <Heffalump> isn't that dangerous?
08:25:51 <Heffalump> I thought vacuums can generate static that might blow up chips
08:25:58 <shapr> well, I haven't smelled any smoke yet.
08:26:15 <shapr> and I'm still online =)
08:26:20 <delYsid> My disk still seems to die soon?
08:26:25 <delYsid> s/?/!/
08:26:38 <shapr> delYsid: you have backups?
08:26:46 <delYsid> yeah
08:26:53 <delYsid> 8 days old or so.
08:27:08 <shapr> better backup your haskell sources :)
08:27:26 <delYsid> And I've started to move work-in-progress onto my usbflashchip
08:28:07 <shapr> my room was a bit messy.
08:30:00 <shapr> btw, lasers pointers don't fare well against pocket lint.
08:31:46 <shapr> hei dark
08:31:48 <dark> delYsid: By the way, thanks for demonstrating Parsec yesterday :)  It gave me new ideas for my code, even though I ended up not actually using it.
08:31:52 <dark> shapr: Hello :)
08:32:11 <shapr> we're forming a knowledge community! yay!
08:32:34 <delYsid> dark: I'm far from knowing what I do here :)
08:32:44 <delYsid> Maybe you have some Parsec code for me to look at?
08:34:17 <dark> delYsid: No, I just read its docs and realized how a combinatorial parser could make my code much simpler.  I couldn't use Parsec directly because it assumes that a parse failed if it didn't consume any input.
08:34:26 <shapr> delYsid: hey, Tom Moertel wrote some Parsec code for his icfp2001 entry, have you looked what he wrote?
08:35:07 <dark> I'm working on the x86 disassembly module, and the instruction templates are now going to look like this:
08:35:08 <delYsid> no. link?
08:35:15 <dark> ([ byte 0x00, modrm, eabyte, bytereg ], gen_ADD)
08:35:17 <dark> instead of like this:
08:35:27 <dark> disassembleInstr (0x00 : modrm : bs) = -- Add byte register into EA byte
08:35:27 <dark>   with_modrm gen_ADD (modrm : bs) 8 1
08:37:29 <dark> One thing I like about Haskell is the way I can simply use "gen_ADD . reverse" to get the same instruction with reversed source and destination operands :)
08:38:06 <shapr> what about using . flip?
08:38:47 <dark> shapr: flip works with the disassembleInstr form, but with the "new" instruction templates, gen_ADD will take an [Expr] instead of an Expr -> Expr.  So I need reverse instead of flip.
08:39:13 <shapr> delYsid: http://www.moertel.com/~thor/icfp2001/
08:39:29 <shapr> dark: oh, I think that vaguely makes sense to me.
08:39:49 <shapr> sounds more general to take a list rather than a function
08:39:55 <shapr> I could be wrong =)
08:40:14 <dark> shapr: With the "new" form, all the gen_ functions have to fit in the same place of an instruction template, so they need the same type :)  The "old" form is just a list of function definitions, so it's easier to make the gen_ functions all have different types.
08:41:47 <dark> shapr: If I really wanted to, I guess I could have a type: data Generator = NoOperands [Stmt] | OneOperand Expr -> [Stmt] | TwoOperands Expr -> Expr -> [Stmt], etc, and then have "TwoOperands gen_ADD" in the template.  This might make it faster.  But I'll worry about speed after it actually works :-)
08:45:03 <dark> It gets a bit frustrating to rewrite the same module over and over :)  But I don't think I can actually finish it using the messy old model.
08:49:13 <shapr> well, the journey is part of the fun
08:49:17 <shapr> not just the destination :-)
09:05:35 <delYsid> shapr: Did you ever manage to compile haskore with ghc?
09:09:44 * dblack is back (gone 28:24:10)
09:22:19 <shapr> delYsid: yes I did
09:22:29 <shapr> took a bit of arguing with it, but I got it to compile
09:22:46 <shapr> first, you need to rename SFF.LHS to Sff.lhs
09:23:02 <shapr> then somewhere it complains about fromInt, which needs to be changed to fromIntegral
09:23:33 <delYsid> lexx:/tmp/Src# ghc -fglasgow-exts --make Haskore
09:23:33 <delYsid> ghc-5.02.2: chasing modules from: Haskore
09:23:33 <shapr> then there's a module that calls (3%2), and you need to put "import Ratio" (or Rational, I forget which) at the top
09:23:33 <delYsid> ghc-5.02.2: can't find module `IOExtensions'
09:23:51 <shapr> right,  you need to "cp ../ghc_add/IOExtensions.hs ."
09:24:00 <shapr> Haskore was written for Hugs originally
09:24:41 <shapr> ghc needs the IOExtensions.hs module
09:24:52 <shapr> that should get it compiling for you...
09:25:05 <delYsid> ghc-5.02.2: can't find module `IOExts'
09:25:09 <shapr> I'm going out to buy dinner for my woman... I'll be back in an hour :-)
09:25:16 <shapr> oh, you need add -package data or something...
09:25:21 <shapr> I forget which package IOExts is in...
09:25:54 <shapr> anything else before I disappear?
09:26:06 <delYsid> Bitops.lhs:16: Variable not in scope: `fromInt'
09:26:16 <shapr> yah, I mentioned that one already :-)
09:26:27 <shapr> replace fromInt with fromIntegral
09:27:05 <shapr> ok, I'll be back for monadic parsing in an hour or so...
09:46:22 <jadrian> hi
10:03:08 <dark> Hmm... I have a parser function now, but I need to know how many bytes it consumed after a successful parse.  Currently it just returns a list of the remaining bytes.  Is there a way I can find out how many bytes it took, given the list of remaining bytes and the original list of bytes?
10:03:38 <dark> I should mention that these lists can have hundreds of thousands of elements, and they're parsed in 1 to 5 byte increments :)
10:03:41 <ibid> length original - length remaining? (not very efficient)
10:04:11 <ibid> i don't think there is a better way - unless there is some compiler-specific unsafe stuff for this
10:04:17 <dark> ibid: Right, I need something more efficient than that.  I wonder if haskell's laziness is strong enough to know when orig_bs == new_bs, without evaluating both lists?
10:04:26 <ibid> (given you data structures)
10:04:36 <ibid> dark: i don't think so
10:04:56 <delYsid> Before I search till I get crazy, does ghc-5.02 maybe not have ParsecPrim???
10:05:04 <dark> I guess I'll have to add a bytes_consumed field to the parser state, then.
10:05:09 <ibid> dark: yes
10:06:51 <dark> ibid: I already made an "atleast" function to avoid having a whole list evaluated just to do "length xs >= 4" :-)
10:07:20 <dark> delYsid: My ghc-5.04 has it, at least.
10:08:01 <hdaume> anyone know what "lexer: misplaced NUL?
10:08:03 <hdaume> means?
10:08:04 <dark> delYsid: You might have to call it Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Prim or something.
10:08:23 <hdaume> (when compiling with ghc 5.02.3)
10:10:21 <dark> hdaume: Hmm... if you list the source files, do they look normal? 
10:10:45 <dark> hdaume: I'd expect that kind of error message if you have a chunk of binary zeroes in your file, which would mean filesystem corruption.
10:11:31 <hdaume> dark: they look fine to me
10:12:27 <Heffalump> dark: what you need is a length function that generates natural numbers :-)
10:15:59 <dark> hdaume: It could mean an unexpected end of file.  It seems that NUL is used as a sentinel value to mark the end of the file.  But it's an ugly error message for it, it indicates something wrong in the parser.
10:16:10 <dark> hdaume: Do you have something like an unclosed comment or pragma?
10:16:46 <hdaume> dark: yeah; it's not actually stopping the compilation, it's more like a warning message.  no weird stuff in the files and they compile fine with 5.04 (without the warning)
10:17:06 <dark> hdaume: Oh then it was probably fixed :)  Actually I'm looking at 5.04 sources here.
10:17:22 <dark> hdaume: The message is from a "trace" command in the lexer.
10:17:40 * hdaume just reinstalled 5.02.3 because he got sick of profiling not working in 5.04
10:18:04 <dark> Profiling not working?!? I hope that gets fixed before I finish my program :-)
10:18:53 <hdaume> at least it doesn't work under solaris...i get the impression it's okay on win32 and linux
10:21:21 <dark> Oh, okay :)
10:21:35 <delYsid> /home/mlang/haskell/Stunden.hs:85:
10:21:35 <delYsid>     Couldn't match `Minutes' against `()'
10:21:35 <delYsid>         Expected type: GenParser Char Minutes Minutes
10:21:35 <delYsid>         Inferred type: GenParser Char Minutes ()
10:21:37 <delYsid>     In the application `updateState (+ balance)'
10:21:37 <delYsid>     In a case alternative: updateState (+ balance)
10:21:43 <delYsid> -- What could that mean?
10:22:40 <dark> delYsid: forgot a return, perhaps?
10:23:53 <dark> delYsid: I'd have to see the code to say something sensible :)
10:37:50 <delYsid> IT WORKS!!!!
10:44:09 <delYsid> hmmmm
10:44:20 <delYsid> Any example on reading froma  file?
10:45:39 <dark> delYsid: section 7.4 of the Gentle Introduction has some.
10:45:59 * shapr returns
10:46:13 <shapr> profiling doesn't work in 5.04?
10:46:15 <delYsid> shapr: I have state now!
10:46:21 <shapr> hm, I haven't tried that
10:46:24 <shapr> delYsid: awesome! what did you do?
10:46:36 <shapr> recursive calling with explicit passing, or monad with implicit passing?
10:46:47 <delYsid> Use CharParser st a instead of Parser a
10:46:56 <shapr> uhm. ok.
10:47:03 <shapr> obviously I need to read the Parsec docs.
10:47:25 <delYsid> It's a monad with implicit passing if I got this right...
10:48:49 <shapr> my room is clean...
10:48:53 <shapr> I think my computers are in shock about it.
10:58:32 <shapr> delYsid: do you have your latest source online?
10:59:24 <delYsid> shapr: yup
10:59:35 <delYsid> same url
11:00:03 <delYsid> And I think I start to understand monads.... but then again, not
11:00:51 <shapr> heh
11:00:53 <shapr> same here
11:01:07 <shapr> delYsid: sooo, how hard to create an irclib with Parsec?
11:01:31 <delYsid> I'm sure it's very easy
11:01:40 <delYsid> parsing an irc message is quite simple.
11:01:44 <shapr> hmm
11:02:08 <delYsid> A message looks like:
11:03:06 <dark> delYsid: Yeah but parsing the drek spewed out by actual IRC servers might be more difficult :-)
11:03:10 <delYsid> [(type, server, args)]
11:03:33 <dark> delYsid: With "server" do you mean origin?  It could be a nick as well as a server.
11:03:47 <shapr> dark: delYsid wrote very much of the IRC client I use =)
11:04:19 <dark> shapr: Okay then I'll assume he is familiar with said drek :-)
11:04:26 <shapr> yah, much more than I am..
11:04:34 <shapr> I wrote one feature!
11:04:44 <shapr> even if it was only three lines of code ;-)
11:04:52 <dark> What I would like to see is an IRC network that speaks UTF-8
11:05:24 <shapr> that could be nifty
11:05:47 <dark> shapr: Some people's nicks could be hard to type :-)
11:05:54 <delYsid> dark: Every message has a server field, that doesnt have anything to do with target (nick/channel)
11:06:19 <shapr> hei eivuokko
11:06:28 <eivuokko> moe
11:06:31 <shapr> wassup?
11:06:36 <shapr> kuis kulkee?
11:06:44 <delYsid> well, and ircnick's have a skandinavian charset, so we'd need a new rfc for a utf-8 irc...
11:06:54 <eivuokko> mmm, ihan hyvin.
11:08:05 <shapr> delYsid: I didn't know that
11:08:17 <delYsid> well, now I'm impressed, the gametree stuff in whyfp.ps is amazing!
11:08:28 <shapr> is that from John Hughes?
11:08:30 <delYsid> f/me ponders writing Gametree.hs and/or Chess.hs
11:09:15 <delYsid> Why Functional Programming Matters \Lambda
11:09:15 <delYsid> John Hughes, Institutionen f¨or Datavetenskap,
11:09:15 <delYsid> Chalmers Tekniska H¨ogskola,
11:09:15 <delYsid> 41296 G¨oteborg,
11:09:15 <delYsid> SWEDEN. rjmh@cs.chalmers.se
11:09:32 <shapr> ah yes
11:09:41 <shapr> I think I read  that paper long long ago
11:09:47 <shapr> I didn't get anything out of it at that time
11:09:49 * shapr reads it again
11:09:57 <delYsid> yeah, do that
11:10:24 <delYsid> evaluate = maximise . maptree static . prune 5 . gametree
11:10:38 <delYsid> This is soooo sweet and elegant!
11:12:54 <delYsid> MiniMax.hs would also make sense
11:21:51 <shapr> delYsid: so, what's your opinion of Haskell so far?
11:22:16 <delYsid> I like it, I'm a bit helpless, but I like it :)
11:22:29 <shapr> eivuokko: are you trying to learn Haskell? or maybe you are an experienced user?
11:22:34 <shapr> delYsid: yah, I feel that way too :-)
11:22:41 <shapr> I wish I had more time to play with it...
11:22:55 <delYsid> DId you try WASH yet?
11:22:59 <shapr> I do play with it a lot, but I feel I'm learning at a snail's pace.
11:23:04 <shapr> yah, I've tried it
11:23:10 <shapr> the HTML generation part is very cool
11:23:24 <shapr> other than the fact that it partially uses javascript :-P
11:23:25 <shapr> which sucks
11:23:36 <shapr> the CGI part won't compile with ghc 5.04, and I can't figure out why.
11:23:40 <shapr> I think it's a compiler bug
11:23:50 <shapr> I need to trim the broken file down to the one piece that breaks
11:24:10 <eivuokko> shapr, I am not trying to haskell especially, I'm trying to understand more of functional programming, and besides you have nice discussions (to read) here.
11:24:33 <shapr> eivuokko: ok, cool... if you have any questions feel free to ask here.
11:24:41 <shapr> I'm glad you enjoy our discussions :-)
11:25:04 <hdaume> anyone here going to ssafp?
11:25:11 <shapr> what is it?
11:25:13 <eivuokko> Oh, I am not shy to ask, don't worry. Thanks anyway :)
11:25:30 <hdaume> summer school in advanced fp
11:25:35 <shapr> I wish :-)
11:25:58 <shapr> I'm moving to sweden, and that's sucking up my time and money.
11:26:12 <shapr> wish I were moving to chalmers ;-)
11:26:15 <shapr> that would be cool
11:26:28 <hdaume> hehe yes it would
11:26:34 <shapr> hdaume: are you going to ssafp?
11:26:41 <hdaume> yeah, i am
11:27:26 * shapr googles for ssafp
11:27:55 <hdaume> there's a link off of haskell.org
11:37:12 * shapr gets distracted
11:37:30 <shapr> hdaume: looks like a great meeting of the minds
11:38:04 <hdaume> yeah; it should be informative, to say the least :)
11:39:19 <hdaume> bbiab
11:40:41 <delYsid> hmmm, so a Monad is nothing else than a state transformer?
11:42:31 <ibid> a monad value is an abstract state transformer
11:42:57 <delYsid> type MyState s a = s -> (a,s)
11:56:01 <shapr> hei Jii!!
11:56:02 <shapr> ltns!
11:56:09 <Jii> hey again :-)
11:56:11 <shapr> wasssup?
11:56:21 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
11:56:55 <shapr> delYsid: hey, did you get Haskore working?
11:56:59 <Jii> yah, i started it few weeks ago, but gave up for a while, now I'm back at it :)
11:57:15 <shapr> awesome!
11:57:22 <shapr> are you learning it for class? or for fun?
11:57:25 <delYsid> shapr: yes, it finally compiled, but I didnt really do anything with it yet.
11:57:37 <Jii> shapr, just for fun
11:57:44 <shapr> delYsid: same here... I couldn't figure out how to turn childSong6 into a midi file...
11:58:01 <delYsid> I'd like to figure out how to manually define a Show instance for a type synonym
11:58:12 <shapr> delYsid: if you figure out how to go from Music -> Performance, I'd be happy :-0
11:58:25 <Jii> there's "when the HaskellWiki returns" in the topic, what does that mean? (i noticed it doesn't contain much ;-)
11:58:26 <shapr> delYsid: you can't do it for type synonyms.. only for real types
11:58:38 <shapr> Jii: the RCS locks are screwed, so all the pages are blank
11:59:01 <shapr> delYsid: hey, check out my Mandelbrot-0.2.hs @ http://purl.org/net/shapr/haskell/
11:59:02 <delYsid> shapr: What's the difference betweena type synonym and a real type?
11:59:09 <Jii> shapr, ohh, well, it's better than everything being empty for real ;-)
11:59:25 <shapr> Jii: yah, I agree
11:59:37 <shapr> delYsid: I built this first:
11:59:42 <shapr> type MandelData = (Integer, Complex Double, Complex Double)
11:59:48 <shapr> that represents one point in a fractal
12:00:02 <shapr> problem is, I can't make a type synonym an instance of a typeclass
12:00:12 <shapr> so Heffalump hooked me up with :
12:00:16 <shapr> newtype MandelData = MandelData (Integer, Complex Double, Complex Double)
12:00:24 <shapr> and now I have:
12:00:25 <shapr> instance Show MandelData where
12:00:25 <shapr>     show (MandelData (iters, z, c)) = "MandelData with values: Iteration Count: " ++ show iters ++ ", value of Z:" ++ show z ++ ", value of C:" ++ show c
12:00:41 <shapr> Jii: so, how far have you gotten into learning it? are you using a book or online docs only?
12:00:55 * shapr notes that .fi hostnames dominate on #haskell
12:00:59 <Jii> shapr, back in the python world, tim peters made an very impressive new implementation of list.sort() btw :-)
12:01:12 <shapr> how so? is it on pythonowns?
12:01:17 <Jii> yes
12:01:18 <delYsid> so, what's the diff of newtype and type then?
12:01:25 <delYsid> Could'nt you write that also with type?
12:01:36 <Jii> shapr, I've been reading online stuff
12:02:09 <Jii> shapr, it's real hard to switch to pure functional programming mindset, though ;-)
12:02:15 <shapr> truly it is...
12:02:20 <shapr> my brain is stretching all kinds of ways
12:02:37 <Jii> but that's just good
12:02:45 <shapr> delYsid: seems that newtype truly makes a new type, but type is for synonyms only
12:02:52 <shapr> and no, I have no idea why that is so...
12:03:05 <delYsid> ahh, I keep confusing type and data
12:03:07 <shapr> yah, brainstretching means improved ability to think in other ways
12:03:27 <shapr> my python and java code have benefitted from my increased haskell knowledge
12:03:57 <shapr> otoh, switching to a lazily evaluated language is another kind of thinking switch
12:04:01 <Jii> are you doing a lot of list comprehensions now ;-)
12:04:11 <shapr> nah, very little actually
12:04:19 <shapr> Jii: check this out:
12:04:29 <dark> shapr: Maybe .fi hostnames dominate because liiwi has been recruiting :-)
12:04:41 <shapr> the simplest way to get the first item in a list that satisfies a certain condition is to do:
12:04:48 <shapr> (head . filter) list
12:04:52 <dark> I haven't used _any_ list comprehensions yet.
12:05:04 <shapr> my python brain says "no, that filters the whole list, and will take forever"
12:05:24 <shapr> but in reality, it only filters till it finds something to send to head
12:05:30 <shapr> is that mind boggling or what?
12:06:26 <Jii> yes, don't boggle too much yet :)
12:06:29 <dark> shapr: Be careful about what happens if the filter doesn't match anything :)
12:06:34 <shapr> yah, truly
12:06:34 <eivuokko> Can that be usually made available in library level in functional languages, or is it done at language level?
12:06:47 <shapr> eivuokko: what?
12:06:51 <shapr> that what?
12:07:04 <shapr> lazy evaluation? that's language level
12:07:23 <shapr> you can force strictness with the strictness operator...
12:07:28 <shapr> which I can't remember at the moment...
12:07:28 <eivuokko> The partical lazy evaluation. Dunno what's the real name for it.
12:07:52 <Jii> i wonder how much attention that pragmatic programmer lang of the year project has drawn to haskell
12:07:54 <dark> lazy evaluation is the real name for it :)
12:08:05 <shapr> Jii: some, not so much though...
12:08:10 <eivuokko> Let me elaborate in few minutes.
12:08:13 <dark> I made this function for lazy length checking:
12:08:14 <dark> -- Used to check if a list is long enough, without evaluating its full length.
12:08:14 <dark> atleast :: Int -> [a] -> Bool
12:08:14 <dark> atleast 0 _ = True
12:08:14 <dark> atleast _ [] = False
12:08:14 <dark> atleast n (_:xs) = atleast (n - 1) xs
12:08:23 <shapr> Jii: the [pragprog] list has occasional spurts of activity.. and #loty is usually not very active
12:08:42 <dark> So now I can use conditions like "if atleast 1 matching" without evaluating the whole list.

12:10:26 <dark> hdaume: I wonder if the RULES pragma could be extended to cover it.
12:10:49 <shapr> dark: oh, I get it... that's cute code.
12:11:00 <delYsid> Which class is responsible that addition works?
12:11:09 <hdaume> Num
12:11:51 <hdaume> it would be difficult because if you had a type which was arithmetic modulo 7 (for instance), this wouldn't hold
12:11:52 <delYsid> /home/mlang/haskell/Stunden.hs:16:
12:11:53 <delYsid>     Can't make a derived instance of `Num Minutes'
12:11:53 <delYsid>     (too hard for cunning newtype deriving)
12:11:53 <delYsid>     When deriving instances for type `Minutes'
12:11:56 <delYsid> -- hmmm
12:12:03 <hdaume> it would require coordination between Num and Ord (for this example, at least)
12:12:07 <hdaume> you can't derive instances of Num
12:12:15 <hdaume> you have to write them yourself
12:12:21 <hdaume> something like:
12:12:30 <hdaume> (assuming newtype Minutes = Minutes Int)
12:12:35 <Jii> shapr, what's your current project with haskell, then?
12:13:13 <hdaume> instance Num Minutes where { Minutes a + Minutes b = Minutes (a+b) ; same for -, *; fromInteger = Minutes . fromInteger ; abs (Minutes x) = Minutes (abs x) } should be sufficient
12:13:15 <shapr> Jii: TwistedHaskell of course =)
12:13:22 <Jii> heh
12:13:30 <Jii> what does glyph think of it? :)
12:13:43 <shapr> his comment was something like "oh, that should be interesting."
12:14:14 <shapr> he said a purely functional implementation should be fun to see.
12:14:27 <shapr> truly it's stretching my brain a bit much...
12:15:54 <shapr> Jii: what about you, what are you doing with it?
12:18:12 <Jii> shapr, i don't have a big project in mind right now
12:18:59 <delYsid> hdaume: Thanks
12:19:03 <Jii> .. but i will come up with some, soon, of course :)
12:19:44 <delYsid> ugh, what does that mean?
12:19:45 <delYsid> *Stunden> testMe
12:19:45 <delYsid> *** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
12:19:56 <shapr> what are you trying to read?
12:20:15 <hdaume> dely: np
12:20:19 <delYsid> hmm, I guess 'n Int
12:20:33 <hdaume> dely: what is the definition of the type Minutes?
12:20:38 <delYsid> I get this since I switched from type Minutes = Int to newtype Minutes = Minutes (Int)
12:21:19 <hdaume> del: hrm...you should be able to derive Num on a newtype (you cannot on a datatype)...this may be a bug (not sure though)
12:21:44 <dark> delYsid: Why not just newtype Minutes = Int ?
12:22:02 <delYsid> ahh, yeah, why not?
12:22:24 <delYsid> Can I derive Show for it then?
12:22:48 <hdaume> you can always derive Show
12:23:02 <delYsid> ok, only if it's a newtype then
12:23:20 <hdaume> the rule is basically, for datatypes you can derive Show,Read,Eq,Ord,Enum and a few others; for newtypes you can derive *anything* that the base type is an instance of
12:23:35 <hdaume> so if you use 'newtype Minutes = Minutes Int' you should be able to derive Num
12:24:28 <delYsid> ahem, now I'm confused
12:24:33 <dark> Why were you using newtype anyway?  I forgot.
12:24:38 <Jii> for the couple of hours experience of haskell i'd guess that Prelude.read: no parse would mean that i'm using "read" on a malformed value ;-)
12:24:42 <delYsid> Whats the diff between newtype Minutes = Minutes Int and newtype Minutes = Int
12:24:48 <shapr> because you can't derive Show from a type synonym
12:25:02 <hdaume> delysid: the latter isn't acceptable, i don't think
12:25:05 <dark> shapr: Ah, yeah.
12:26:06 * shapr tries to figure out whether to use polymorphism or type classes
12:26:13 <Jii> how common is it to use layout to structure haskell programs?
12:26:19 <delYsid> well, I still get this strange exception...
12:26:30 * delYsid isn't very fond of haskell's error messages.
12:26:35 <shapr> Jii: I use that only
12:26:52 <shapr> delYsid: I've learned that sometimes hugs gives better error messages.
12:27:14 <hdaume> Jii: i think that's very person dependent; i use it most of the time except for (1) small case statments (i.e., let x = case y of {Nothing->0; Just x->x+1}) and (2) a replacement for let for efficiency concerns; ashley yakeley, otoh, hates it
12:27:25 <hdaume> delysid: what's the exception
12:27:40 <delYsid> *** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
12:27:42 <shapr> yah, yakeley converts layout source to braces...
12:27:43 <Jii> hdaume, ashely yakeley?
12:28:03 <hdaume> jii: a haskell programmer...up in seattle,wa i think
12:28:05 <shapr> he's an interesting guy who lives in Seatlle
12:29:00 <Jii> seattle produces intresting guys ;-)
12:29:13 <shapr> truly
12:29:22 <dark> All the ghc sources seem to use layout.
12:30:20 <hdaume> dark: for the most part; there are exceptions; they tend to follow my (2) rule above, too
12:30:32 <hdaume> dark: (or, rather, i stole my rule (2) from them)
12:30:34 <dark> hdaume: What's the (2) rule?
12:31:12 <dark> hdaume: Meaning, I don't understand it :)
12:31:41 <shapr> what's slow about let?
12:32:02 <hdaume> read http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/faster.html
12:32:20 <hdaume> the 'strict functions are your dear friends' part
12:33:44 <dark> hdaume: Hmm... can't the compiler do that transformation on its own?
12:34:07 <hdaume> no, because sometimes you don't want the matching to be strict; sometimes it needs to be lazy
12:34:42 <hdaume> (let x = undefined in 5) is not the same as (case undefined of { x -> 5 })
12:35:53 <dark> hdaume: Ah, I see.  In fact I use that a lot :)
12:36:12 <hdaume> dark: the wonders of laziness
12:37:06 <dark> hdaume: I often have a series of small functions in the let part, and the body runs the ones that have valid data.  Like with the "if atleast 1 xs" example above.
12:37:45 <hdaume> dark: yeah, exactly...that seems to be a preferred way to do it
12:38:19 <dark> Anyway, I'll get the program to work before I worry about speed :-)
12:38:19 <Jii> shapr, have you been working with the hudak's "multimedia haskell" book?
12:38:51 <shapr> Jii: I have it, but I prefer the Thompson book
12:39:07 <shapr> Jii: if you're comfortable with math, you'll probably prefer Hudak
12:39:34 <dark> Hmm, that page says to look at the interface file for clues.  But ghc 5.04 produces binary interface files.  Is there a dumping tool?
12:39:47 <hdaume> ghc --show-iface
12:39:52 <hdaume> ghc --show-iface filename
12:40:59 <hdaume> i also prefer "egrep '^[a-z].*::.*[ ,(][A-Z].*=>"
12:41:31 <dark> hdaume: cool, thanks.
12:55:17 * shapr fights the type system
12:55:45 <Jii> don't fight it, live with it! ;-)
12:55:53 <shapr> yah, it's a good system.
12:56:08 <shapr> I'm still having trouble think with it, rather than against it.
12:56:12 <shapr> "thinking"
13:02:34 <shapr> I'd like to put a string onto the head of any list I get as a parameter...
13:02:55 <shapr> I can't figure out how to do that....
13:03:02 <shapr> I have:
13:03:03 <shapr> jellyList x = "list" : x
13:03:21 <shapr> and the type there is: [[Char]] -> [[Char]]
13:03:24 <Jii> are you doing any python stuff nowadays?
13:03:45 <shapr> Jii: I do Zope stuff for money three days a week.
13:03:51 <shapr> what about you?
13:04:18 <shapr> my evil plan is to move my Zope clients to a combination of Zope, Twisted, and Haskell
13:04:26 <shapr> that's why I'm writing TwistedHaskell
13:04:45 <Jii> hah, evil :)
13:05:06 <shapr> I'm convinced that I can write my webapp stuff much faster in Haskell... once I get my head wrapped around it.
13:05:15 <Jii> i costantly do some little stuff
13:05:27 <shapr> delYsid: have you tried WASH yet?
13:05:35 <Jii> but my main thing is to do "scientific" writing right now
13:05:45 <shapr> like what?
13:08:02 * shapr reads http://pythonowns.blogspot.com/
13:08:33 <Jii> well, school stuff, i'm writing a paper on expressive power of programming languages
13:08:45 <Jii> (not really deep stuff, though)
13:08:48 * shapr installs ghc5-hopengl on another debian machine to see if -package OpenGL works there
13:09:02 <shapr> Jii: going to post links to drafts on your blog?
13:09:08 <shapr> I'd be interested in what you have to say.
13:09:15 <Jii> it's in finnish :/
13:09:46 <Jii> i originally intended to write it in english but gave up
13:10:10 <Jii> but if you can read finnish, why not ;-)
13:11:52 <shapr> my finnish sucks :-/
13:12:14 <delYsid> Did anyone already try to implement chess in haskell?
13:12:26 * shapr dunno
13:12:47 <delYsid> Using literate haskell/latex, lazy lists, this could make for a really nice reference implementation .
13:12:53 <Jii> shapr, how did you end up doing zope stuff for work? clients demanded? ;-)
13:14:24 <shapr> Jii: nah, EU project politics shifted the blame for an undone website to the german Uni I work for, three weeks before that website was due to be shown at an EU project audit.
13:15:14 <shapr> rather than taking that blame lying down, we just built the website. I said we could do it in three weeks with Zope... we did it in less.
13:15:32 <Jii> pragmatic programmer! :)
13:16:05 <shapr> they wanted it in IIS + ASP, I refused, and said only with Zope could I do it in time.
13:16:26 <dark> shapr: You can't put a string in a list unless it's a list of strings :)  Basic property of Haskell lists.
13:16:48 <shapr> dark: what about those unified types?
13:20:23 <dark> shapr: Well your literal "list" is definitely of type [Char].  That means that the list has to be of type [[Char]].  One thing you could do is not use the literal directly, but apply a conversion function to it.  For example, read.  Then you can have type (Read a) => [a] -> [a]  (I think)
13:21:07 <dark> shapr: You'll end up with not having a string on the list, though :)
13:21:20 <shapr> well...
13:21:21 <shapr> hmm
13:21:50 <dark> shapr: If you really want a list of mixed types, then you need to create a datatype that has all those types as alternatives, and then make the list of that datatype.
13:22:26 <dark> For example, [Either String a] -> [Either String a]
13:22:32 <shapr> hm
13:22:36 <shapr> that looks nifty
13:22:43 <dark> And then push (Left "list") on the list.
13:23:19 * shapr tries that
13:24:02 <dark> My Expr type currently has 7 alternate types :-)  This way all of the operations can take [Expr] for their operands.
13:24:20 <shapr> how do you do it with seven alternate types?
13:24:24 <shapr> Either is for two, yes?
13:24:35 <dark> Yeah, I have a data declaration with alternates.
13:24:46 <shapr> what does your declaration look like?
13:25:12 <dark> Okay, prepare for an 8-line flood :-)
13:25:13 <dark> data Expr = ConstInt Integer
13:25:13 <dark>           | Undefined String  -- string is reason
13:25:13 <dark>           | Register Type String
13:25:13 <dark>           | BinExpr BinOp Expr Expr
13:25:13 <dark>           | DerefExpr Type Expr
13:25:16 <dark>           | Cast Type Expr
13:25:18 <dark>           | AsmExpr Type String Type Expr -- string is asm opcode string.
13:25:19 <dark>     deriving (Eq, Show) -- Show for debugging only
13:25:27 <shapr> hmm
13:25:30 <shapr> interesting.
13:25:35 <shapr> thanks
13:26:50 <dark> A simpler example would be:
13:27:03 <dark> type ListElem = IntElem Int | StringElem String | BoolElem Bool
13:27:42 <dark> Then you can have [ListElem] lists.  But the downside is that nearly all functions on ListElem will have to do pattern matching to act differently on IntElem, Stringelem, BoolElem, etc.
13:29:09 <shapr> as long as it works, I can try to refactor it to something saner later.
13:29:30 * dark is now inspired to put more comments on his Expr declaration :)
13:29:56 * shapr snickers
13:32:04 * dark notices that Intel thinks "LIDT" comes after "LLDT" in the alphabet.
13:32:21 <shapr> I'd worry about their sorting algorithm
13:32:39 <delYsid> argh, I'm doing something completely wrong again...
13:33:54 <shapr> ?
13:35:09 <delYsid> data Color = White | Black
13:35:19 <delYsid> data Kind = A | B | C
13:35:33 <delYsid> data Piece = Color Kind
13:35:39 <delYsid> -- something is wrong there...
13:37:01 <shapr> why? what's wrong with that?
13:37:20 <delYsid> How I'm supposed to instantiate a Piece now?
13:37:33 <delYsid> s/I'm/am I/
13:37:36 <shapr> x = White A ?
13:37:41 <shapr> does that work?
13:38:11 <shapr> oh wait
13:38:17 <shapr> x = Piece White A
13:38:18 <delYsid> no
13:38:19 <shapr> does that work?
13:38:26 <shapr> err
13:38:39 <shapr> here's an example I have in front of me:
13:38:49 <shapr> data People = Person Name Age
13:38:54 <shapr> type Name = String
13:38:59 <shapr> type Age = Int
13:39:13 <shapr> Person "Ronnie" 14
13:39:42 <shapr> data Pieces = Piece Color Kind
13:39:54 <shapr> x = Piece White A
13:39:59 <delYsid> aaaaaah
13:40:02 <shapr> looks like how it should work
13:40:03 <delYsid> tnx :)
13:40:07 <shapr> sure :)
13:40:08 <delYsid> The Piece was missing :)
14:40:11 <delYsid> http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/haskell_and_monads.htm
14:40:33 <delYsid> (I haven't seen that till now, but it is very good imo)
14:54:39 <shapr> delYsid: does that mean you understand monads now?
14:55:12 <delYsid> I'm n% closer at least :)
14:55:33 <shapr> heh
14:55:47 <delYsid> A Monad is a continuation. at least afaiu it now
14:56:15 <delYsid> A continuation with local state
14:56:23 <delYsid> Or
14:56:42 <delYsid> A way to express ordered evaluation.
14:58:20 <delYsid> getX, getY :: StateTrans ImpState Int
14:58:20 <delYsid> getX = ST(\(x,y)-> ((x,y), x))
14:58:20 <delYsid> getY = ST(\(x,y)-> ((x,y), y))
14:58:20 <delYsid> putX, putY :: Int -> StateTrans ImpState ()
14:58:20 <delYsid> putX x' = ST(\(x,y)->((x',y),()))
14:58:22 <delYsid> putY y' = ST(\(x,y)->((x,y'),()))
14:58:28 <delYsid> -- This is really nifty!
14:59:36 <shapr> somedays I understand monads.
14:59:38 <shapr> somedays I don't
14:59:41 <delYsid> gcdST :: StateTrans ImpState Int
14:59:41 <delYsid> gcdST = do x <- getX
14:59:41 <delYsid>            y <- getY

14:59:42 <delYsid>             then
14:59:42 <delYsid>                  return x
14:59:44 <delYsid>             else if x < y
14:59:46 <delYsid>             then

14:59:56 <delYsid>                     gcdST)
15:00:24 <dark> I've been using a lot of Maybe monads lately.  They're easy to understand :)
15:00:51 <delYsid> A recursive monadic gcd :)
15:01:54 * Heffalump hands delYsid a pointless use of monads award
15:02:18 <dark> Just wait till you see my monadic "length"! :-)
15:02:25 <Heffalump> (well, unless you think your compiler can eliminate the recursion in gcdST but not the obvious functional definition)
15:18:55 <delYsid> Heffalump: Well, I've cutpasted this code from the url I pasted...
15:19:10 <delYsid> But it is nice for illustration methinks.
15:24:25 <shapr> I still don't quite understand it..
15:24:33 <shapr> ah well, there's always tomorrow.
15:24:39 * shapr goes off to play games for a bit
15:26:40 <Heffalump> oh, yeah, it's good for illustration
15:26:51 <Heffalump> but GCD is one algorithm that really doesn't need monadic code :-)
16:41:18 <dandelion-> do you have any opinion which among the current approaches towards GUI programming in haskell (gtk+hs, fudgets, haggis, hgl, ihaskell, whatever) is the best?
16:47:53 <shapr> dandelion-: best according to what standard?
16:48:10 <shapr> portability, ease of use, speed of development, or what?
16:49:15 <dandelion-> hmm..
16:49:19 <dandelion-> in general
16:49:23 <dandelion-> which one do you like best?
16:49:32 <dandelion-> oh yes, i have a standard
16:49:42 <dandelion-> which one is best for programming in a functional way?
16:49:55 <dandelion-> i mean, in spite of emulating imperativeness using monads
16:50:11 <dandelion-> since we are in a functional language, we should have a functional way of doing things, too
16:51:37 <shapr> I like gtk or gtk2 best, mostly because that's what I've used before...
16:51:43 <shapr> I don't know which one is most functional...
16:52:04 <shapr> I'd suggest asking that question on the haskell mailing list, you'll get a good answer there.
16:52:05 <dandelion-> they are both not functional at all
16:52:17 <dandelion-> hmm..
16:52:24 <shapr> right, but I mean "which one of the ones you mentioned"
16:52:27 <dandelion-> okay, maybe i'll do this or in a newsgroup
16:52:47 <shapr> I think you'll get the best answer from the haskell mailing list, and I'd like to hear that answer also.
16:52:51 <shapr> for now, I have to sleep.
16:52:55 * shapr goes to sleep.
16:52:56 <dandelion-> good night
21:39:53 <Jii> 'morning
22:37:40 <ibid> morning
