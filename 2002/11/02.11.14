00:59:35 <lament> hm
00:59:43 <lament> I don't understand this definition
00:59:48 <lament> fib = 1 : 1 : [ a+b | (a,b) <- zip fib (tail fib) ]
01:00:32 <lament> Shouldn't evaluating (tail fib) turn the whole thing into _|_ ?
01:03:01 <ibid> why?
01:03:19 <ibid> remember the operational intuition of laziness
01:03:29 <ibid> call by need :-)
01:04:32 <lament> but tail does get called
01:04:53 <ibid> yes
01:04:59 <ibid> and tail is non-strict
01:05:30 <lament> but to find the tail of a list you have to evaluate it
01:05:58 <ibid> no. to _evaluate_ the tail of a list you have to evaluate it
01:06:16 <lament> I mean, evaluate the list
01:06:22 <lament> not evaluate its tail
01:06:26 <ibid> yes, but that is different
01:06:59 <ibid> if you force the evaluation of fib, then it is bot, yes
01:07:23 <ibid> but if you force the evaluation of (head fib), it's not bottom
01:07:32 <lament> but the definition has (tail fib) in it
01:07:40 <ibid> so?
01:07:45 <ibid> you are thinking too strictly
01:07:48 <ibid> eagerly
01:07:49 <lament> if I use (tail fib) anywhere _after_ the definition, it never terminates
01:08:01 <lament> if i evaluate it that is
01:08:04 <ibid> lament: only with eager evaluation
01:08:26 <ibid> lament: to evaluate head fib, you don't need to evaluate the whole of fib
01:08:34 <lament> yes
01:08:53 <lament> what does head fib have to do with it?
01:08:57 <ibid> actually, while evaluating head fib, you never get to evaluating the tail fib in the rest of it
01:09:04 <ibid> lament: everything!
01:09:24 <ibid> lament: partial evaluation is what happens
01:09:36 <lament> yes, head fib won't do anything
01:09:38 <ibid> lament: fib is evaluated only as much as is necessary to satisfy the demand
01:09:48 <ibid> lament: head fib evaluates to 1
01:09:52 <lament> but take 3 fib would cause (tail fib) to get evaluated, wouldn't it?
01:09:57 <ibid> lament: only partially
01:10:21 <ibid> lament: only as far as is necessary to produce three elements of the fib list
01:10:32 <lament> um
01:10:35 <ibid> lament: the rest is left unevaluated
01:10:37 <lament> to produce the third element of the list
01:10:54 <lament> we need one member of [ a+b | (a,b) <- zip fib (tail fib) ]
01:11:10 <lament> to get that, we need tail fib
01:11:33 <ibid> lament: you are thinking of eager evaluation. it does not apply here
01:11:50 <lament> um, but we must evaluate that to get the third element of the list
01:12:07 <ibid> no!
01:12:18 <ibid> we need to evaluate some of it, *not* all of it
01:12:24 <lament> I said "one member"
01:12:25 <ibid> think of it this way:
01:12:33 <lament> we must get one member of that list
01:12:36 <ibid> yes
01:12:48 <lament> to do that, we must call (tail fib)
01:13:06 <ibid> think of it this way: every expression is a promise. every subexpression of it is a promise
01:13:17 <lament> I understand that!
01:13:19 <ibid> when you force evaluation, you force the outer expression's promise
01:13:40 <lament> I don't think you understand my problem :)
01:13:56 <ibid> i don't understand why you don't understand
01:14:02 <lament> I have no problems with lazy evaluation. I just don't understand where (tail fib) gets its result
01:14:04 <ibid> but i do know what happens in that example
01:14:19 <ibid> lament: in other words, you don't understand lazy evaluation
01:14:48 <lament> Perhaps. So where does tail fib get its result?
01:15:05 <lament> After all, fib doesn't _have_ a tail
01:15:56 <ibid> lament: tail fib is a promise. when it is forced, we get case fib of { (x:xs) -> xs; [] -> []  }, as a promise
01:16:02 <ibid> lament: yes it does
01:16:26 <ibid> lament: we then force that and get xs, which is a promise that *is not forced*
01:16:58 <ibid> if we force the first element of tail fib, we get that again, but now the first element is forced.
01:17:20 <lament> Oh. I got it.
01:17:26 <ibid> we never need to evaluate the whole fib to get tail fib unless all of its elements are forced
01:17:41 <ibid> good, i need to go and attend a lecture on measure theory
01:17:42 <ibid> bbl
01:17:57 <lament> Thanks
02:03:51 <ibid> there was a mistake there, the case will not have the [] -> [] branch :-)
03:41:07 <Arnia> Hiya
03:41:21 <Heffalump> hi
03:42:38 <Arnia> I've been trying to compile the latest version of FranTK with GHC 5.04 and it keeps running out of stack space in the file GUIDef.lhs. Has anyone installed it successfully
03:43:08 <Heffalump> try upgrading to the latest release
03:43:13 <Heffalump> of GHC
03:43:17 <Heffalump> I think there was a compiler bug in 5.04
03:44:14 <Arnia> Ah, ok... will do.
03:44:14 <Arnia> There was also the problem of the prelude not containing fromInt in GHC
04:02:09 <Igloo> You want fromIntegral
04:03:54 <Arnia> Yes, I altered the code slightly for that... anyway. I must be off now
04:31:17 <ibid> Igloo: ?
04:32:43 <Igloo> ibid: I was just going to ask why you preferred your build system (haven't had a chance to look at it yet), but having seen the bug about adding a build-dep on hugs I think I can guess  :-)
04:33:48 <ibid> ?
04:34:01 <Igloo> I am currently hoping to understand the package and arch by around the end of next week, BTW
04:34:10 <Igloo> "?"?
04:34:32 <ibid> actually the haskell-doc build system is not what i would now use but i'm too lazy to upgrade it, especially if you will change it soon
04:34:52 <ibid> i don't see how the bug has to do with my build system...
04:35:03 <ibid> i just dislike debhelper
04:35:09 * ibid likes to roll my own
04:35:23 <Igloo> Oh, well I guessed you used runhugs to build the package or something - guess I was wrong
04:35:26 <Igloo> Fair enough  :-)
04:35:32 <ibid> i have a moderately cool rules helper of my own
04:36:06 <ibid> but haskell-doc does not use it
04:38:44 <ibid> (btw, it's a Makefile library:-)
04:38:53 <ibid> librules.mk
04:40:05 * Igloo is likely to use debhelper as it's more standard unless you can convince me yours is vastly superior
04:41:25 <ibid> it's probably not
04:42:20 <ibid> my biggest problem with debhelper (apart from not having learned it) is that changes in the build environment can have radical efffect on the package
04:42:54 * ibid does not like that, i believe that a change in packaging practice should be effected only by a change in the package...
04:43:22 <Igloo> DYM the setting of env variables?
04:43:26 <ibid> no
04:43:30 <ibid> version of debhelper
04:43:42 <Igloo> Ah, right
04:43:44 <ibid> version of debhelper installed
04:44:23 <Igloo> That's sort of necessary for it to do things like the doc transition for you, though
04:50:06 * shapr notices Topic :: [[Char]]
04:50:08 <shapr> cute :-)
04:50:25 <Igloo> :-)
04:50:31 <shapr> did you do that Igloo?
04:50:40 <Igloo> No
04:51:09 * Igloo can't remember who did OTTOMH
04:51:20 <ibid> Igloo: that's exactly what it shouldn't do
04:51:27 <ibid> Igloo: not at least without a change in the rules file
04:51:29 * Igloo goes to get dressed, cook and stuff
04:51:47 * ibid read that "dressed, cooked and stuffed". sorryed.
04:51:51 * shapr laughs
04:52:00 <shapr> what does get stuffed mean?
04:52:04 * shapr has always wondered
04:52:25 <ibid> in that context, probably what you do to birds when you add stuff into them before cooking
04:52:34 <shapr> hey, I was thinking about Python's distutils modules... wouldn't that be good for Haskell?
04:52:35 <Igloo> ibid: Well, it's a declarative system. You say "install docs (in the right place)", not "put this file, which happens to be a doc, in this directory, which happens to be where docs go"
04:52:45 <Igloo> Anyway, not going to argue this one further  :-)
04:52:47 * Igloo really goes
04:52:54 <shapr> also, I was wondering about putting up a copy of Parnassus for Haskell
04:53:07 <ibid> Igloo: i wouldm't mind if there was an option for policy version...
04:53:22 <ibid> what's distutils?
04:54:21 <shapr> distutils is a set of Python scripts for automagically building and installing Python libraries, even compiling C extension modules
04:54:35 <ibid> hm
05:21:26 <ibid> bah, redefinition of implicit parameters seems not be possible
05:25:58 * shapr still hasn't figured out what those are
05:26:39 <Heffalump> ibid: wdym redefinition?
05:27:51 <ibid> rebinding
05:28:07 <ibid> something like this:
05:29:14 <ibid> http://www.mit.jyu.fi/antkaij/tmp/gfoo.txt
05:29:48 <ibid> i probably need to make a monad out of this...
05:29:51 * ibid hates monads
05:32:14 <Heffalump> I haven't used them, but I was under the clear impression that you can rebind them
05:32:45 <ibid> well, this is what i get as the trace output:
05:32:50 <ibid> p = -400, p' = -2147483648
05:32:50 <ibid> p = -700, p' = -2147483648
05:32:50 <ibid> p = 400, p' = -2147483648
05:32:50 <ibid> p = 400, p' = -2147483648
05:32:50 <ibid> p = 100, p' = -2147483648
05:32:53 <ibid> p = 0, p' = -2147483648
05:32:55 <ibid> p = 100, p' = -2147483648
05:33:14 <ibid> *and* the real output suggests that the p' are not propagated right
05:33:32 <ibid> (p' is initialized as minBound :: Int)
07:14:37 <jadrian> hello
07:15:07 <ayrnieu> hello jadrian.
07:15:13 <jadrian> hi ayrnieu
07:32:03 <ibid> argh
07:32:11 * ibid just converted that to use ST
07:32:12 <Igloo> ?
07:32:14 <ibid> no change
07:32:17 <Igloo> Ah
07:32:43 <ibid> for some reason either trace is not seeing the changes or my writes are not coming through
07:33:16 <ibid> and it seems they *aren't* getting through
07:34:02 <Heffalump> ibid: well, trace uses unsafeperformIO, which is always asking fro trouble
07:34:12 <Heffalump> but ask jadrian about your implicit parameters, he uses them a lot
07:34:24 <ibid> no implicit parameters anymore
07:34:30 <ibid> and i don't have the version available
07:34:36 <ibid> (destructive updates:-)
07:34:40 <ibid> (on the source files)
07:34:44 <Heffalump> ah :-)
07:35:47 <Heffalump> I still have it, in my browser cache :-)
07:36:11 <ibid> not the whole example
07:36:16 <Heffalump> this is true
07:36:17 <ibid> where i cut&pasted it from
07:36:35 <ibid> something *very* weird is going on here...
07:37:06 <ibid> do you have time & energy to help me debug this? (and some knowledge of ST and STRef?)
07:37:44 <Heffalump> I have the latter but not the former, sorry
07:37:50 <jadrian> back
07:37:58 <Heffalump> if you can distill it to small snippets I might be able to help
07:38:01 <jadrian> ibid: Argh ST and STRef! :))
07:38:03 <ibid> anybody else?
07:38:32 * jadrian is having a very weird problem with ST+ STRef + Implicit Parameters
07:38:44 <jadrian> ibid: shoot
07:38:54 <ibid> the relevant module is about 200 lines of uncommented code...
07:39:10 <jadrian> errr... that's quite a bit...
07:39:59 <ibid> http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/ebba/ebba-h/Prettyprint.hs?rev=1.2&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
07:40:02 <ibid> that's the current version
07:41:12 <ibid> texify is the problemous function
07:43:24 <ibid> is anybody looking at it or should i just try again myself?
07:45:28 * ayrnieu` confirms his preference for 'where' bindings when they are equivalent to 'let' bindings.
07:45:39 <ibid> heh
07:46:25 <ibid> would where see the binding made in the do block?
07:46:41 <ibid> oh, btw, me too, but i'm not sure if i can use where there
07:47:07 <ayrnieu`> yeah, I don't think you can use 'where' there unless you pass 'ref' around.
07:47:26 <ibid> and that's exactly what i am trying to avoid
07:52:18 <ibid> ahh!
07:52:20 <ibid> i know now
07:52:27 <ayrnieu`> what?
07:53:18 <ibid> i'm allocating a new ref at each recursive call
07:53:25 <ibid> so they see a different variable
07:56:42 <ayrnieu`> ah, OK.  So are you going to put 'case parameter of' in a 'where' and pass thread 'ref' through it?
07:56:46 <ayrnieu`> s/pass //
07:59:09 <ibid> no
07:59:20 <ibid> i'll do what i was supposed to do in the first place
07:59:32 <ibid> replace the case with a function definition, calling itself recursively
07:59:36 <ibid> but bbl
08:26:23 <ayrnieu`> quote: The Beginning Haskell Tutorial (you have to sign up at IBM to get to it, but all they want is an email address) has a lot of beginner stuff, but I don’t trust anybody who thinks "product [] = 0"
08:26:37 <Heffalump> :-)
08:31:18 <Marvin--> heh
09:01:28 <ibid> where's that?
09:02:27 <ayrnieu`> http://www.cs.uaf.edu/~cs331/Haskell%20web%20pages.htm
09:11:11 <hays> How successful has Haskell been at "unifying" FP?  I'm thinking of learning it because it looks cool.
09:11:25 <hays> (but OCaml also looks cool :) )
09:11:57 <Heffalump> it was designed to unify the lazy FP languages, and it's certainly done that
09:12:12 <Heffalump> there's no sensible alternative to Haskell unless you want some really experimental features
09:12:28 <hays> lazy as in algol/60?
09:12:58 <ayrnieu`> hays - I don't know algol/60.
09:14:13 <hays> lazy just means passing everything by name and evaluating it only if its referenced directly in a calculation (i.e. needed)
09:14:18 <hays> ?
09:14:25 <Heffalump> yes
09:14:29 <Heffalump> algol/60 was call by name, right?
09:14:37 <hays> i believe so
09:14:43 <Heffalump> did it copy things if something unevaluated was referenced twice?
09:15:05 <ibid> no, lazy eval is not call by name
09:15:08 <ibid> it is call by need
09:15:21 <Marvin--> call by name is also called lazy evaluation iirc
09:15:33 <ibid> some people call it that :-)
09:15:34 <Marvin--> it *is* lazy, but it may also be extra work
09:15:43 <hays> Heffalump that I don't know
09:15:58 <Igloo> Haskell is often described as cal by thunk IIRC
09:16:08 <ibid> algol 60 had call by value and call by name
09:16:30 <ibid> Igloo: rather unfortunate. thunks are used for lots of things, including both call by name and call by need
09:16:54 <ayrnieu`> readfile "file" >>= \f -> lineReading f -- lazily, 'readFile' would examine the file and supply lines to 'lineReading' only so far as 'lineReading' demands them.
09:17:50 <ibid> hays: the difference is that algol 60 call by name would evaluate the parameter every time it is used; haskell's call by need evaluates it at most once, reusing the result as needed
09:17:59 <ibid> ayrnieu`: that's actually not a good example
09:18:08 <ibid> ayrnieu`: it requires unsafePerformIO
09:18:14 <ibid> uhm
09:18:19 <ibid> unsafeInterleaveIO
09:18:22 <hays> oh yes i read about this in the erm "yet another haskell tutorial"
09:19:10 <ibid> hays: if we are being picky, haskell does not specify call by need or lazy evaluation but nonstrictness, which is usually implemented using laziness and call by need
09:19:13 <ayrnieu`> ibid - what actually happens?  The entire file is read?
09:19:37 <ibid> ayrnieu`: your example does what you said but it does nasty things under the hood
09:19:50 <ibid> ayrnieu`: without the nastiness it would read the whole file and then use it
09:20:00 <ayrnieu`> hm, OK.
09:20:24 <ayrnieu`> unsafeInterleaveIO is another function I must come to understand.
09:20:53 <ibid> ayrnieu`: it essentially takes an IO a action and makes it a "pure" lazily evaluated value
09:21:32 <ibid> ayrnieu`: there are safe uses of it but strictly speaking lazy file reading is not one of them - but people like it so much
09:21:42 <hays> almost looks like Caml and Haskell are the "two" fp languages to learn
09:21:58 <ibid> i'd say Haskell and some ML dialect
09:22:00 <hays> I wonder where Scheme fits in, which is what I am most familiar with now
09:22:10 <ibid> speaking as one who does not know any ML dialect :-)
09:22:12 <ayrnieu`> hays - Curry and Mercury are also nifty.
09:22:17 <ayrnieu`> hays - oh, and Erlang.
09:22:50 <hays> queueing theory woo hoo
09:22:55 <ibid> hays: Scheme is dynamically typed and uses Cambridge Polish notation. ML and Haskell use algebraic notation and are statically typed
09:23:46 <ayrnieu`> Scheme has the Lisp heritage of read/print/eval and entire-system-available-at-all-times, which is nice.
09:24:44 <ibid> ayrnieu`: hm, compare to unsafePerformIO which does the same thing but the result is eager (fully evaluated at return)
09:24:54 <hays> any suggestions on which might be best to start with
09:24:56 <ayrnieu`> ibid - ah!  OK.
09:25:09 <Heffalump> unsafeInterleave IO stays within the IO monad
09:25:19 <Heffalump> so it doesn't break the type system like unsafePerformIO does
09:25:27 <ibid> Heffalump: unsafeInterleaveIO :: IO a -> a, IIRC
09:25:32 <ayrnieu`> hays - Haskell or O'Caml or Erlang are, I think, all good starting points.
09:25:40 <Marvin--> ibid: no I think it's IO a -> IO a
09:26:06 <Heffalump> consider SML instead of O'Caml - less featureful, but there are multiple implementations available
09:26:07 <ibid> oh you're right
09:26:10 <ibid> yes
09:26:21 <ibid> ok, i'll correct myself
09:26:35 <hays> hmm ok
09:26:42 <ibid> unsafeInterleaveIO takes an (IO a) action and makes it lazy (of the same type)
09:27:01 <Marvin--> unsafeInterleaveIO is scary
09:27:15 <ibid> all unsafe functions are scary
09:27:25 <ibid> they're black magic
09:27:42 <Heffalump> unsafeInterleaveIO only breaks the monadic sequencing guarantee, which isn't /that/ scary
09:28:44 <ayrnieu`> unsafeInterleaveIO seems too useful to be scary, whereas I've only found global variables as a good use of unsafePerformIO.
09:30:06 <ibid> ayrnieu`: i've use uPIO to implement caches
09:30:28 <ibid> for example, look at the Name module in ebba
09:31:10 <ayrnieu`> ebba?
09:31:59 <ibid> the thing you helped me debug
09:32:11 <ayrnieu`> ah, OK.
09:35:20 <ibid> http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/ebba/ebba-h/Name.hs?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
09:37:48 <ibid> anybody know why any type signature mentioning ST gives a nasty error?
09:37:53 <ayrnieu`> hm, OK =)
09:38:09 <ayrnieu`> What nasty error?
09:38:21 <ibid> Quantified type variable `s' escapes
09:38:56 <ibid> i get that every time i write an explicit type for a function that uses ST
09:39:36 <Heffalump> give an example
09:39:38 <ayrnieu`> Even when your explicit type is identical to the otherwise inferred type?
09:41:19 <ibid> see Prettyprint.hs, texify's ifix
09:49:47 <ibid> strange thing
09:50:22 <ibid> assuming there is no type signature for infix, it seems to get a monomorphic type
09:50:44 <ibid> (the type signature was an attempt to get the compiler give a useful error message
09:50:47 <ibid> )
09:50:52 <ibid> ifix, not infix
09:51:29 <Heffalump> is it one component of something big that'll be fed to runST?
09:51:53 <ibid> what is?
09:52:00 <Heffalump> the function with the type problem
09:52:06 <ibid> yes
09:53:09 <ibid> for referecne, the source file is http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/ebba/ebba-h/Prettyprint.hs?rev=1.3&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
09:56:18 <ibid> ifix is defined like this:
09:56:47 <Marvin--> don't you need forall s . ST s a?
09:57:11 <Heffalump> what type signature did you try to give it?
09:57:19 <ibid> ifix pred assoc p op q = do { pt <- rec (tpar p) ; qt <- rec (tpar q) ; paren pred assoc $ s(pt ++ op ++ qt) }
09:57:26 <ibid> ifix :: Texifiable a => Int -> Assoc -> a -> String -> a -> (ST s String)
09:57:29 <Marvin--> oh heck, I gotta run
09:57:46 <ibid> tried to add a forall, but apparently at a wrong place
09:57:49 <ibid> (didn't help)
09:57:56 <Heffalump> that has an implicit forall in it anyway
09:58:06 * Heffalump thinks
09:58:18 <Heffalump> anyone know how type inference of binding groups interacts with explicit type signatures?
09:58:19 <ibid> tpar is a class method for a class which has instances for Predicate and Expression
09:58:55 <ibid> calling that with p and q as Predicate works, but if p and q are Expressions, i get a type error
09:59:05 <ibid> (Predicate expected, Expression inferred)
09:59:23 <ibid> this is withouut the type signature
09:59:36 <Heffalump> hmm, I think it's too big for me to get my head around atm
09:59:41 <ibid> heh
10:00:27 <ibid> i just cannot understand what is wrong there
10:00:52 <ibid> there are so many moving parts that making a simple test case would probably be hard
10:03:55 <ibid> why cannot it accept Expressions for p and q?
10:08:48 <ibid> http://www.mit.jyu.fi/antkaij/tmp/errors.txt <- the full error message for the type signature
10:08:52 <ibid> any ideas, anyone?
10:43:09 <jadrian> hi
10:50:59 <ibid> here is a simple version:
10:51:01 <ibid> http://www.mit.jyu.fi/antkaij/tmp/Test.hs
10:51:06 <ibid> anybody have ideas?
10:51:48 <ibid> (error message: Couldn't match `T' against `U' Expected type: T Inferred type: U In the first argument of `ifix', namely `p' In the definition of `rec': ifix p 'D' q)
10:52:39 <jadrian> ibid: let me check
10:59:33 <ibid> no ideas?
11:01:48 <jadrian> hmmm not yet
11:02:38 <jadrian> ibid: what exactly are you trying to do?
11:03:04 <ibid> that is a simplified version of Prettyprinter.hs, see above
13:43:00 <jadrian> back
13:44:09 <jadrian> ibid: you there?
15:32:50 * shapr bounces
15:32:57 <stepcut> ack
15:33:20 <shapr> hi Pseudonym
15:34:12 * Igloo grumbles
15:34:28 <shapr> ?
15:34:34 <shapr> what's up Igloo?
15:35:15 <Igloo> About to completely rebuild GHC woth the expectation/hope of doing so again in a few days time
15:36:29 <Pseudonym> G'day.
15:42:11 <jadrian> hi Pseudonym
15:43:01 <shapr> hey jadrian, I like that "iterate p f x" trick
15:43:22 <jadrian> shapr: hmmm which one? the monadic one?
15:43:52 <jadrian> shapr: or the simple one, to create and consume lists?
15:49:21 <jadrian> anyone with a recent snapshot of gch?
15:49:23 <jadrian> or cvs...
15:50:08 <Igloo> I have a reasonably recent one, but I don't know exactly how old irritatingly
15:50:16 <Igloo> Oh, wait, modification date ought to tell me!
15:50:32 <jadrian> Igloo: can you try out something for me Igloo?
15:50:39 <jadrian> Igloo: this might be a ghc bug
15:50:44 <Igloo> 8th Nov, right
15:50:46 <Igloo> Sure
15:50:52 <jadrian> Igloo: and I'd like to know if it works with earlier versions 
15:51:10 <jadrian> may I copy paste it to you in pvt, it's not big
15:51:16 <Igloo> OK
15:51:23 <jadrian> thanks let me get it
15:53:07 <jadrian> Igloo: did you get it?
15:53:21 <Igloo> Yup
15:53:34 <jadrian> thanks
15:54:17 <Igloo> Is an "Ambiguous constraint" error what you wanted?
15:54:25 <jadrian> :(
15:54:46 <Igloo> Or what you didn't want, rather  :-)
15:55:06 <jadrian> well seems to me like pure2 is about the same thing as pure
15:56:05 <jadrian> I've been told that this load on hugs (with something other than the STRefs)
22:17:16 <ibid> problem solved!
22:17:30 <ibid> it was the infamous monomorphism restriction
