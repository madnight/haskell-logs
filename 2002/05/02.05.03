03:26:00 <aquaq> hm nexus?
03:26:15 <aquaq> oki baba
21:32:20 <Pseudonym> Can anyone thin of a concise example of using fundeps?
21:42:07 <jcore> fundeps?
21:43:09 <Pseudonym> Typeclass functional dependencies.
21:45:45 <Pseudonym> Am I asking the wrong people?
21:47:23 <Logan_> I haven't heard the terminology.
21:47:30 <Logan_> I was going to ask for an example... :P
21:47:49 <Pseudonym> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/pubs/fundeps-esop2000.pdf
21:48:33 <Pseudonym> I'm writing some stuff for the wiki.  Just wondered if someone had a better example than Mark Jones' paper.
21:49:13 <Logan> Ok, do you understand type classes in general?
21:49:20 <Pseudonym> Sure.
21:49:48 <Logan> Ok, then this paper is talking about extending that so that typeclasses can describe a relation between multiple types (as opposed to one type related to itself).
21:50:04 <Pseudonym> I know that.  I understand what fundeps are.,
21:50:17 <Logan> For instance, if you can convert type a to type b, you could say that a, b are an instance of Coerce a b (the first example they give)
21:50:23 <Pseudonym> I just was wondering if someone had a better example for the wiki page than the ones from the paper.
21:51:11 <Logan> Hmm, I'll haev to read the whole thing. :P
