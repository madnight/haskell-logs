04:52:25 <casaa> lo all
04:53:06 <casaa> does anyone know an IO action in Prelude or somewhere else that clears the screen ?
04:58:51 <Heffalump> you'd have to output the appropriate code for the terminal the output was going to
04:59:08 <clausen> there might be wrappers for curses, or something?
04:59:18 * Heffalump not sure
05:01:42 <casaa> cant seem to find one ... dont think it exists
05:02:09 <casaa> i see
05:02:16 <casaa> thanks... bye
