20:23:14 <jethr0> i wonder if equal-blame-distribution fits into a monad :)
20:23:39 <shapr> Since then I've gotten quite a bit of EU website work from these guys and those greeks.
20:24:25 <MarcWeber> Who was the guy writing the plugin for eclipse is he here?
20:24:26 <shapr> About two years ago I told 'em that Zope/Plone was getting way too crufty and it was time to switch to something else, but they're comfortable with Python/Zope/Plone and don't want to change.
20:24:28 * jethr0 didn't even know there _existed_ a .int TLD...
20:25:40 <tromp_> when they run out of 32 bit adresses they will introduce .integer  :P
20:25:41 <jethr0> shapr: you don't speak modern greek, do you?
20:26:02 <shapr> The increasing cruft is increasing the difficulty and therefore the cost of the same tasks I did before. So they're getting grumpy at me and I'm getting grumpy at them.
20:26:19 <shapr> Nope, I can only order beer, food, and say hi, thank you, you're welcome, etc.
