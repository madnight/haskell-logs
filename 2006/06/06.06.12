00:00:05 <fwfewfwa> that has some sense anyway...
00:00:16 <ibid> fwfewfwa: mmap happens to be a common Unix system call and hence belongs in Section 2 "System Calls" ;)
00:01:01 <aFlag> if you think about it, function() is a valid C function declaration, so refering to a function as function() is not totally wrong
00:01:10 <aFlag> althought it's still silly :P
00:01:18 <ibid> it's only valid pre-C99
00:01:26 <aFlag> yeah
00:01:26 <ibid> and it was deprecated in C89 :)
00:01:56 <aFlag> that's what makes it silly :P
00:02:20 <ibid> :)
00:02:39 <fwfewfwa> with that point of view i could talk about what happens when i call extern "C" int myfunction();
00:02:52 <ibid> that's not  C :)
00:02:59 <fwfewfwa> it's C++ :)
00:03:04 <ibid> yes
00:03:17 <fwfewfwa> well, extern int myfunction(); works i think (i'm not sure)
00:03:32 <ibid> yes, but means different
00:03:32 <fwfewfwa> extern int __std_call myfunction();
00:03:38 <fwfewfwa> :)
00:03:42 <ibid> that's not C either ;)
00:03:47 <eivuokko> __stdcall
00:03:49 <fwfewfwa> it is
00:03:54 <fwfewfwa> __std_call is a macro :)
00:03:59 <ibid> fwfewfwa: defined where?
00:04:04 <fwfewfwa> on the header :)
00:04:13 <ibid> fwfewfwa: which?
00:04:20 <fwfewfwa> in the one i use :)
00:04:23 <ibid> rememebr, no coffee ;)
00:04:28 <Pete_I> why does ord("a") return an error, but ord('a') doesn't?
00:04:36 <fwfewfwa> ord expects a char probably
00:04:39 <fwfewfwa> "a" is a string
00:04:42 <ibid> Pete_I: because one is a character and the other is not
00:04:54 <Pete_I> how do you tell?
00:05:00 <Pete_I> the quotes?
00:05:02 <ibid> yes
00:05:08 <fwfewfwa> technically you could say both are strings
00:05:15 <ibid> double quotes for strings, which are lists
00:05:18 <fwfewfwa> because from your point of view, a character is a specialization of a string...
00:05:21 <ibid> fwfewfwa: not in haskell
00:05:38 <ibid> fwfewfwa: but there is a POV where you are right about that
00:08:29 <fwfewfwa> and there is a POV where all are graphs
00:08:33 <fwfewfwa> or all are numbers...
00:08:36 <ibid> yes
00:08:37 <aFlag> what's a pov?
00:08:42 <ibid> and they have their uses
00:08:48 <ibid> Point Of View
00:08:51 <aFlag> oh
00:09:38 <ibid> for most uses, the idea of a string being a sequence of characters is harmful in the age of unicode
00:09:44 <fwfewfwa> really you are just a pile of molecules, we could destroy you and use you to create something usefull...
00:10:30 <Pete_I> why is that harmful?
00:10:35 <ibid> careful there. if i was being uncharitable i'd think that you're running out of arguments as you are resorting to ad hominem attacks ;)
00:10:48 <fwfewfwa> nah :)
00:10:57 <fwfewfwa> i'm just trying to be as ridiculus as yourself :)
00:11:14 <ibid> fwfewfwa: i hope you are having fun, i know i am
00:11:41 <ibid> Pete_I: or so they tell me
00:14:08 <aFlag> i'd say it's harmful because a single letter could take more than one character
00:14:13 <aFlag> which is not very intuitive
00:14:56 <skew> you mean with accents and ligatures?
00:15:45 <aFlag> well, every symbol that doesn't fit in one single char
00:15:59 <skew> do you mean byte?
00:16:09 <aFlag> yeah, a char being a byte
00:16:11 <skew> or are you talking about glyphs that correspond to sequences of code points?
00:16:40 <skew> ah, thinking of unicode as a sequence of bytes sounds like a bad idea
00:17:14 <skew> oh, "char" being the type in C
00:17:39 <ibid> the problem is that in unicode, "character" is not a unique thing
00:17:47 <ibid> unicode talks about code units
00:18:11 <ibid> the same character can have more than one representation in terms of code units
00:18:30 <ibid> in some UTFs, characters are not easily indexable even if the underlying data structure is

00:59:54 <lambdabot> http://hope.bringert.net/
01:00:15 <shapr> dons: More that lambdabot's plugin system made it a raging success, and hope's plugin system is pleasant (though not perfect yet) and will likely do the same for it.
01:00:27 <dons> ah, right.
01:00:50 <dons> yes, keeping things really decoupled is important for success, i think, in decoupled open source dev.
01:00:58 <dons> well, it certainly helps, anyway
01:01:32 <shapr> Also, lambdabot's two plugin flavors make it easy to write a simple plugin with the simple flavor, or a powerful plugin with the complicated flavor.

01:38:25 <Lemmih> They'll be integrated if I've understood it correctly.
01:39:19 <xerox> That's what I thought. That is, if you want to install a package and all its dependencies, even if you have downloaded the pakages, you will use cabal-get.

03:15:15 * gds wonders if this is a good place to ask for help getting hs-libs to work in mandriva...
03:16:10 <Pete_I> sounds relevant.
03:16:33 <gds> (hs-plugins sorry :S)
03:16:54 <dons> how does it fail?
03:16:59 * dons <- author of hs-plugins
03:17:09 <gds> Hey dons :)
03:17:24 <gds> Trying to compile either yi or lambdabot...
03:17:31 <dons> cool. ok.
03:17:34 <gds> They complain about a lack of Plugins.
03:17:36 <gds> Like so:
03:17:37 <dons> and which ghc? which version of hs-plugins?
03:17:43 <dons> right, so build hs-plugins.
03:17:48 <dons> ?where hs-plugins
03:17:49 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
03:17:51 <gds> Boot.hs:54:0:

03:17:51 <gds>         Could not find module `Plugins': use -v to see a list of the files searched for
03:18:01 <dons> yep. hs-plugins not installed.
03:18:06 <dons> oh, actually, hmm.
03:18:13 <dons> that's an _old_ version of hs-plugins its looking for
03:18:21 <dons> grab the darcs versions of yi or lambdabot
03:18:24 <gds> Ok - so I've downloaded hs-plugins, and run the things the README tells me to run...
03:18:25 <dons> ?where yi
03:18:25 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi.html
03:18:34 <gds> Ok - darcs version, huh?
03:18:39 <dons> which version of hs-plugins did you download?
03:18:52 <gds> I tried the release candidate and the darcs version.
03:19:01 <dons> yep. release candidate should be fine
03:19:17 <dons> the problem is that the yi and lambdabot you've got seem to be asking for the 0.9.4 version, i think
03:19:24 <gds> I did some minor experimenting when it didn't work - tried running make instead of ./Setup.lhs...
03:19:29 <dons> both yi and lambdabot haven't been released for a while
03:19:30 <gds> Which ran some tests...
03:19:34 <gds> one of which failed...
03:19:47 <dons> i think your hs-plugins installatoin is fine

03:20:26 <kzm> (and I did replace www with your server :-)
03:20:28 <dons> kzm, oh :(
03:20:29 <gds> But I figured it was worth mentioning, just in case...
03:20:35 <dons> gds, yep. thanks

03:29:52 <dons> ok.
03:44:07 * gds wonders if the cse.unsw admins are throttling /~dons...
03:47:34 <Stinger_> its probably just Australias sucky telecoms infrastructure
03:49:48 <gds> I can browse the rest of the site fine :)
03:49:56 <gds> Just seems to be ~dons that isn't responding...
03:50:15 <gds> (could be caches in the middle of course...)
03:52:33 <dons> gds, hmm. i can't log in at the moment..
03:52:40 <dons> seems like there's some network issue at the uni
03:53:03 <gds> I'll try again in a few hours :)
03:53:05 <dons> i'm sure there are beepers going off all over the place
03:53:30 <dons> kzm, that's why your urls are 404ing as well. uni network down.
03:53:54 <kzm> Ah, okay.  No hurry, no worries.

04:10:25 <Lemmih> Conjure is moving a bit.
04:16:12 * JKnecht couldn't glean why we need a Haskell BitTorrent
04:19:21 <Itkovian> BCoppens: pong
04:21:22 <JKnecht> although I can think of reasons such as a 'Theory of P2P' or exposing the BitTorrent infrastructure for high reuse is some useful way.
04:21:44 <JKnecht> s/is/in/
04:30:06 <BCoppens> Itkovian: would it be possible to ask 2 small questions (yeah related to tomorrow ;P)
04:30:24 <Itkovian> BCoppens: pm me. I'm about to have lunch :-)
04:31:05 <BCoppens> Itkovian: oh ok, bon appetit :)
04:31:12 <kzm> shapr - I'm rewriting an entry for knucleotide in the shootout. :-)
04:31:35 <kzm> Perhaps un-nifty?
04:33:44 <Lemmih> JKnecht: I have yet to find an efficient bittorrent client.
04:37:30 <JKnecht> that's a good reason. But I thought they were all only as good as the network.
04:39:49 <JKnecht> bbiab
04:43:30 <xerox> shapr - There is a typo in your last entry, I think. ``...the musicians *aren't* the music industry...''
04:52:01 <mahogny> bittorrent is indeed in need of some improvement. stability and transfer rate could be upped a tad lot with some semantic changes...
05:07:43 <shapr> xerox: No, I mean that music comes from musicians, the name music industry is being applied to the wrong people.
05:08:03 <shapr> The people who call themselves the music industry don't make music, I've even heard that many of them don't like music.
05:08:19 <xerox> The latter phrase is what I thought.
05:08:21 <shapr> They just package and advertise the music.
05:08:30 <shapr> mahogny: choking algorithms
05:08:38 <xerox> Right. I maybe just parsed wrongly, sorry.
05:09:08 <mahogny> shapr, well, anything is better than ad-hoc transfer :)
05:09:24 <shapr> kzm: That is nifty
05:09:36 <shapr> xerox: I'll edit the entry and clarify
05:10:04 <kzm> I'm nifting away as much as I can, we shall see if it suffices to outnift the competition.
05:11:19 <mahogny> hm. I earlier theorized that it is probably best to split the music market into 3 cathegories; 1. those who distribute the music 2. those who record music and package it 3. the real musicians. by splitting the market in this way it should be possible to squeeze down the market prices a lot since the distributors are the ones that currently drive up the prices and they big ones are soon no longer needed due to the internet
05:12:05 <xerox> Where are those who earn money in your scheme? :)
05:12:11 <shapr> Categories 1 and 2 would scream because most of category 3 is willing to sell their music for almost nothing.
05:12:23 <mahogny> xerox, the musicians. the big losers are the big companies
05:12:46 <mahogny> the customers wouldn't complain as well :)
05:12:48 <shapr> Right now musicians can already earn money with a label like magnatune.
05:13:22 <mahogny> the % the musicians get today is silly
05:13:22 <shapr> Some big name musical group was recently trying to get 50% of the profits and Warner was screaming about how they could never afford that. Magnatune gives artists 50% of the gross.
05:13:42 <mahogny> lol
05:14:06 <mahogny> there are too few distributors. that's the problem. so some kind of split to reduce prices is required
05:14:32 <mahogny> hm. 50% gotta be a record
05:15:05 <mahogny> musicians usually get something like 1$ per CD sold today, with a big name company. that can't be many percent
05:15:09 <shapr> yup
05:15:24 <shapr> That's why I try to tell new musicians to apply to magnatune first.
05:15:32 <mahogny> do so :)
05:15:59 <kzm> The problem is that the distributors are the one generating the commercial value.  To sell a zillion copies of a CD takes a lot of effort, you need extensive PR as well as control with radio stations and hit lists etc.
05:16:08 <kzm> Musicians are cheap :-)
05:16:40 <mahogny> kzm, that time will soon be over. it's dirt cheap to sell music over the internet, and get PR the same way
05:16:43 <shapr> Or you could have magnatune streaming to your desktop.
05:16:50 <kzm> Manipulation of the public is what you pay for, and the reason you pay $20 for a piece of cheap plastic.
05:16:52 <shapr> Yup, the internet will kill the big distributors.
05:17:12 <kzm> mahogny, I'm not piling up those Sony BMG and Warner shares :-)
05:17:15 <mahogny> the big groups can of course sell CDs as well, but that would be a later stage
05:17:26 <mahogny> kzm, :)
05:17:37 <Pete_I> shapr, or destroy our freedoms.
05:17:50 <Pete_I> depends how the us gov takes it.
05:18:45 <shapr> There is that.
05:18:56 <shapr> But I think encryption will kill any hope of controlling the 'net
05:19:03 <kzm> TOR?
05:19:06 <Pete_I> quite likely.
05:19:20 <shapr> Even if all streams are forced to be plaintext, you can still do steganography.
05:19:59 <shapr> I think .au has a law where ISPs are responsible for the content that goes across their wires.
05:20:30 <Pete_I> i'd like to see them tell the difference between a .exe and an encrypted file.
05:20:32 <shapr> How hard would it be for any of us to send encrypted illegal content across the 'net?
05:20:46 <Pete_I> cake walk.
05:20:47 <dcoutts_> easy, ssh
05:21:15 <shapr> Sounds like a bad time to be an aussie ISP.
05:21:16 <Pete_I> public key encryption.
05:21:45 <shapr> But then again, that law was proposed, I don't know if it got passed.
05:21:48 <mahogny> right, steganography+encryption would be really easy
05:22:02 <shapr> In any case, there's no way to control the 'net without shutting it off.
05:22:10 <Pete_I> the us gov is considering making any server in the states keep records of 'net activity for the past year.
05:22:13 <mahogny> trying to ban that... I guess everyone remembers the DVD encryption? :)
05:22:19 <dcoutts_> and with ssh/scp it's quite easy to send stuff via several hosts
05:23:08 <dcoutts_> eg one can easily do http via a proxy over ssh
05:23:08 <shapr> Hm, you could route parts of the content via different wires, so no single connection would be illegal.
05:23:17 <xerox> Yee-aww! I compiled Gtk2Hs, finally.
05:23:21 <mahogny> if nothing else, if they complain about your network traffic being impossible to make sense of, why not just say that you are using a remote random number generator? :)
05:23:26 <dcoutts_> xerox, yay, why so long?
05:23:52 <shapr> All .au ISPs could be paired and send half of the packets through another network.
05:23:55 <xerox> dcoutts_ - I was waiting for ghc to become a darwinport, but audreyt pointed out that it is simple to manage ghc installations even without package managers.
05:23:56 <dcoutts_> mahogny, in the UK they introduced some law about giving up encryption keys
05:24:14 <mahogny> dcoutts, yeah, heard so. still, can they prove that you use encryption?
05:24:15 <dcoutts_> mahogny, if they suspect you of doing something ilegal then can demand encryption keys
05:24:25 <shapr> dcoutts_: Yow, at that rate I'd write botnets in BrainFuck.
05:24:30 <dcoutts_> and if you refuse it's up to 2 years in jail
05:24:38 <shapr> That's insane.
05:24:45 <Stinger_> need to build a usb encryption key device with a strip of thermite built in
05:24:46 <dcoutts_> xerox, ah good
05:25:07 <Stinger_> like the phone phreakers supposedly used to have 
05:25:09 <shapr> Hey, can I get Safari running on Linux?
05:25:13 <dcoutts_> shapr, well it just means you have to use encryption methods where you never keep a long term key with a known password
05:25:14 <xerox> dcoutts_ - Unfortunately the ports have gtk2.8, with the HEAD there seem to be an experimental native backend (so not to use X11)
05:25:14 <Pete_I> if they banned encryption, brainfuck would be illegal :)
05:25:18 <mahogny> Stinger_, I guess you can give it up then, and let them be the ones to blow it? :)
05:25:23 <dcoutts_> so there is nothing to give up to authorities
05:25:29 <Kasperle> aren't there methods for key negotiation where you as the user don't necessarily know the encryption key?
05:25:34 <shapr> dcoutts_: How do you do that?
05:25:39 <xerox> shapr - I think you can install OS X on a virtual machine, that's the farther you can get.
05:25:42 <shapr> Kasperle: Yeah, but you still have the keys in that case.
05:25:44 <Kasperle> so as long as people don't ban software that uses those methods, you're fine
05:25:48 <Stinger_> aparently some of the old blueboxes had a strip of thermite, with a remote detonator you hid in your belt
05:25:55 <Pete_I> the One Time Pad would make good for that.
05:25:59 <dcoutts_> shapr, not exactly sure, but I heard that things like that are a possible workaround for the law
05:26:00 <Kasperle> shapr: only if the software exposes them to the user?
05:26:04 <Pete_I> not for over the net though...
05:26:25 <shapr> Kasperle: If it's on your drive, it's exposed to the user.
05:26:35 <dcoutts_> xerox, so you're using gtk 2.8 with X11 right?
05:26:46 <xerox> dcoutts_ - Right.
05:26:47 <dcoutts_> xerox, I have high hopes for the native backend
05:26:50 <Kasperle> shapr: true. but this would be a workaround for network traffic, no?
05:27:24 <Kasperle> does diffie-hellmann key exchange do that (i'm not sure)?
05:27:27 <shapr> I dunno, if the UK can demand an encryption key, how do you beat it?
05:27:31 <dcoutts_> xerox, that'll be the last OS where wxWidget looks better than Gtk
05:27:52 <dcoutts_> shapr, by not keeping any encryption key
05:27:52 <xerox> dcoutts_: hehe, right.
05:28:16 <dcoutts_> shapr, but as I say, I'm not sure of the details
05:28:24 <shapr> Or you could use the GnuNet approach, where the key is the id of the item.
05:28:45 <dcoutts_> I just heard at the time the law was passed that it would not be effective because there are techical workarounds
05:29:05 <xerox> $ ./helloworld 
05:29:06 <xerox> Bus error
05:29:06 <xerox> Eeek!
05:29:13 <dcoutts_> heh, not good
05:29:18 <Stinger_> hah
05:29:30 <flux__> practical joke, a hello world with a slightly different message?-)
05:29:36 <sieni> Public transportation failures are always fun
05:29:41 <xerox> haha
05:29:41 <ptolomy> What is the name for this silliness: "A implies B, C implies B.. A is true, therefore C is true."?
05:30:02 <xerox> Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
05:30:02 <xerox> Reason: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at address: 0x00000001
05:30:02 <xerox> (running via gdb)
05:30:15 <xerox> FcFontSetSort (config=0x1a1cf90, sets=0xbfffbe38, nsets=2, p=0x1a1bae0, trim=1, csp=0x0, result=0xbfffbf4c) at fcmatch.c:696
05:30:15 <xerox> 696     fcmatch.c: No such file or directory.
05:30:15 <xerox>         in fcmatch.c
05:30:50 * dcoutts_ wonders if that makes it his fault or not..
05:30:50 <Stinger_> logical fallacy?
05:31:19 <xerox> gtk -> pango -> Fc*
05:31:22 <ptolomy> I seem to remember there being a specific title for that particular fallacy..
05:32:52 <shapr> Yeah, it's something...
05:32:57 <dcoutts_> xerox, try a C gtk hello world
05:33:01 <Stinger_> ptolomy http://www.virtuescience.com/logicalfallacies.html :)
05:33:18 <Stinger_> non sequiter
05:33:49 <Stinger_> thats still sort of general though
05:33:50 <shapr> Stinger_: Yeah, bit it's something useful in proof theory, isn't it?
05:34:56 <xerox> dcoutts_  it works.
05:35:12 <dcoutts_> xerox, hmm
05:35:31 <dcoutts_> xerox, what version of gtk2hs? darcs or a release?
05:35:38 <dcoutts_> xerox, and what ghc version?
05:35:39 <xerox> darcs
05:35:53 <xerox> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.5.20060608
05:36:00 <dcoutts_> how much do you trust ghc on that arch? I thought there were still issues?
05:36:15 <Stinger_> if I had to make a name for it I'd call it reverse transitiveness :P
05:36:20 <dcoutts_> so that's ghc from 4 days ago
05:36:26 <xerox> Yes, I am not sure.
05:58:43 <kzm> I find myself using unsafePerfIO more often than I like.  Is that to be expected when FFIing?
06:00:13 * boegel whipes the sweat off his forehead
06:01:14 * BCoppens gives boegel some airconditioning
06:02:21 <dcoutts_> kzm, possibly yes, but ideally as little as possible
06:02:46 <dcoutts_> kzm, you need it when wrapping a C func that could be pure except for allocation & marshaling
06:03:15 <kzm> The problem is that I have pointer-using functions on the C side, but that are essentially pure.
06:03:23 <dcoutts_> right
06:03:50 <dcoutts_> so you alloca, write into some record, call and read from that record again
06:04:07 <kzm> So I want a pure interface in Haskell.  Anyway, I'll try to wrap it nicely and put in on web, cross my fingers, and hope that somebody will look at it and tell me how it should have been done :-)
06:04:15 <dcoutts_> heh
06:04:39 <dcoutts_> sounds like you're using it in the right way
06:05:05 <dcoutts_> so long as the C func really only examins its args and has no other side effects then it's ok
06:26:43 <kzm> Damn.  I can't get the linking to work again.
06:26:59 <kzm> Anybody know if there's a way I can shoehorn the contents of a .a into another?
06:27:04 <kzm> vi?
06:29:08 <SamB_XP> you could cp it and stuff more .o files in!
06:29:32 <SamB_XP> I don't think recursive .a files work, though
06:31:07 <ihope> Maybe this guy won't do the ping-timeout thingy after all.
06:31:07 <lambdabot> ihope: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
06:31:49 <dcoutts_> kzm, unpack one using ar and then use ar again to add them to the other .a file
06:32:00 <ihope> {lambdabot} ihope_ said 12 hours, 13 minutes and 37 seconds ago: Foo.
06:32:11 <dcoutts_> kzm, .a files are really very similar to .tar files
06:32:16 <kzm> I guess I could rip the command for building the .a files, and use it to populate my FFI lib with the relevant .o files.
06:33:05 <kzm> I'm curious why ghc doesn't link against the .a files, though.  And I could have sworn I got it to work earlier today.
06:33:45 <kzm> Strace shows that ghc finds and opens the file, but I still get "undefined reference"
06:34:10 <ihope> Aha!
06:39:46 <kzm> Another problem: I just added the whole list of *.o files to the ghc cmd line.  Unfortunately, one function is named "count", and it clashes with libHSbase.  Suggestions?
06:40:35 <kzm> I've managed to link against this C library directly, so I don't think it is necessary to rename or mangle names.
06:41:51 * kzm sighs.  Is there any example of a cabalized library that links via FFI to C code?
06:43:25 <lisppaste2> petekaz pasted "complaints about 'otherwise' shadows an existing binding " at http://paste.lisp.org/display/21152
06:43:34 <petekaz> Could someone help me with syntax?  
06:44:01 <petekaz> The above complains about my case statement.
06:44:57 <lisppaste2> petekaz annotated #21152 with "Errors from ghc" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/21152#1
06:45:13 <Dino__> I think you do the 'otherwise' case in a case with _ ->
06:45:19 <petekaz> oh.
06:45:45 <petekaz> That's right, otherwise is only for guards right?
06:45:49 <Dino__> The otherwise is for the guards.
06:46:12 <petekaz> While you are looking at that ... is there an OR statement I can use for the first 2 cases?
06:46:21 <petekaz> They both have the same rhs.
06:48:07 <Dino__> petekaz: I'm not sure (very new to the H myself), but you'd think you'd be able to avoid that repetition of your two cases, yes.
06:51:43 <Dino__> I'm having trouble reading it in The Haskell 98 Report, but can you use | in a case too, anyone?
06:52:20 <Igloo> Yes
06:52:56 <petekaz> Hmmm .. I thought I tried that.
06:53:07 <Dino__> So, pete could have: case responseStatus of { 301 | 302 -> getHtmlPage $ locationHeader contents; _ -> return contents }
06:53:42 <Igloo> No
06:54:09 <Igloo> You can use guards in the same way as you can with functions, e.g. case x of (a, b) | a == 5 -> ...
06:56:50 <Dino__> I'm not following how to do two possible values of a there.
06:57:15 <Igloo> ... | a == 5 || a == 6 -> ...
06:57:38 <Dino__> ok
07:07:13 <alar> what's webpage of haskell OS?
07:07:19 <Dino__> I see what you mean now by "same way as you can with functions."
07:09:07 <dcoutts_> kzm, the clash with 'count' is our fault, it's fixed in current fps and will get into ghc's base soonish
07:09:33 <dcoutts_> kzm, as for a cabal lib that uses ffi, see fps
07:09:40 <shapr> kzm: Doesn't hs-plugins use ffi and cabal?
07:09:49 <shapr> @where house

07:12:28 <dblhelix> shapr is heading for nirvana
07:15:22 <shapr> w00
07:27:47 <dcoutts_> kzm, what was the problem exactly?
07:29:08 <ihope> ...Don't tell me EagleBot hasn't been PINGed since I started the guy up.
07:29:55 <ihope> Hey, wait a minute...
07:30:38 <mux> gah, the weather is way too hot
07:30:41 * mux is melting
07:31:17 <dblhelix> sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines...
07:43:28 <SamB> PoppaVic in ##c doesn't see how this channel can be official with no "commies" :-)
07:43:28 <ihope> So is it /^foo$/ or /$foo^/?
07:43:44 <ihope> SamB: commies?
07:44:05 <shapr> Commies? I don't get it.
07:44:09 <SamB> "committee member"s
07:44:17 <shapr> Oh, we already tried that actually.
07:44:28 <SamB> tried what?
07:44:37 <shapr> I offered to give ownership to SPJ and/or Simon Marlow, but they said it was fine the way it is.
07:45:18 <ihope> Now, I have a feeling that the way to do this is, in fact, (.*) rather than \\(.*\\).
07:45:24 <sieni> "committee members" meaning what?
07:45:32 <shapr> And, since they know about it and they approve of it, I figure we can keep #haskell instead of going to ##haskell
07:46:02 <BCoppens> ah the extra # means it's an 'official' channel?
07:46:12 <shapr> Nah, the extra # means it's an unofficial channel.
07:46:14 <ihope> Just one # is official.
07:46:18 <BCoppens> oh =)
07:46:33 <BCoppens> I think that's kinda silly
07:46:35 <Kasperle> it is
07:46:39 * shapr shrugs
07:46:47 <shapr> I think we should all switch to jabber anyway.
07:46:55 <ihope> Jabber?
07:47:00 <shapr> xmpp
07:47:04 <SamB> no jabbar!
07:47:10 <SamB> er, no jabber
07:47:10 <shapr> Google Talk/gaim/etc
07:47:10 <BCoppens> you can do irc-like chat with jabber?
07:47:13 <Dino__> It may be the server I connect to, but I get kicked constantly from Jabber.
07:47:14 <shapr> Sure, yeah
07:47:17 <BCoppens> nice
07:47:37 <ihope> Has there ever been both a #something and a ##something, both semi-large channels?
07:47:51 <BCoppens> of course, with only one person in my jabber list, not much irc-like chat is possible ;)
07:47:59 <integral> ihope: debian
07:48:06 <BCoppens> oh
07:48:10 <integral> probably gentoo too
07:48:25 <shapr> Jabber also supports multiple charsets, etc
07:48:54 <BCoppens> so does irc, only it isn't explicit about it ;)
07:48:55 <qwr> you can use utf-8 on irc
07:49:00 <BCoppens> yeah
07:49:07 <BCoppens> I have utf-8 by default on irc
07:49:12 <shapr> qwr: Yeah, but it causes arguments on some channels.
07:49:20 <ihope> integral: I wouldn't call ##debian semi-large, unless the number of people there is much lower than usual.
07:49:39 <integral> ihope: it probably is now since debian moved networks :)
07:49:42 <BCoppens> ihope: debian official channels moved yesterday away from this server afaik
07:49:42 <BCoppens> yeah
07:49:44 <alar> irc does not support multiuple charsets!
07:50:10 <shapr> Also, irc doesn't support voice chat.
07:50:11 <ihope> IRC supports ASCII.
07:50:13 <alar> there is no server-side icode here
07:50:13 <shapr> Jabber does :-)
07:50:56 <alar> some irc servers support multiple charsets by opening multiple ports
07:51:06 <alar> but not freenode
07:51:10 <SamB> who cares about multiple charsets? just use utf8.
07:51:14 <BCoppens> yeah
07:51:26 <shapr> It still causes arguments on #haskell.se, #unicycling, etc
07:51:31 <SamB> the trouble is that the RFC doesn't specify this
07:51:46 <BCoppens> shapr: :(
07:51:57 <alar> I care about multiple charsets 
07:52:10 <Stinger_> goooaaaal
07:52:19 <alar> some clients can't do UTF
07:52:23 <SamB> is that the official channel for the unicycling project?
07:52:35 <shapr> Um, well, it started because I was talking about unicycles too much on #haskell
07:52:48 <alar> and unix folk has KOI-8 by default
07:52:50 <BCoppens> alar: yeah but even less will support the exotic alternatives
07:52:52 <shapr> And now it's gotten popular with the Swedish unicycling people.
07:53:00 <SamB> KOI-8 is what?
07:53:04 <shapr> cyrillic
07:53:09 <shapr> russian
07:53:19 <alar> BCOpens: the problem is they aren't exotic
07:53:29 <ihope> [ERROR] Invalid character encoding mode ``KOI-8''.
07:53:38 <alar> Windows folk uses 1251, UNIX folk uses KOI
07:53:57 <SamB> which unix folks use KOI-8?
07:54:07 <alar> ihope: try KOI-8R
07:54:08 <BCoppens> alar: well yeah exactly, so if your client doesn't know how to handle UTF8, it probably won't know how to handle eucjp, sjis and friends either
07:54:12 <vincenz> Hi people
07:54:15 <BCoppens> hey
07:54:19 * vincenz is in gaim to get on irc
07:54:19 <ihope> [ERROR] Invalid character encoding mode ``KOI-8R''.
07:54:23 <ihope> Oops.
07:54:38 <shapr> Sooo, to stop this discussion, jabber's knowledge of charsets makes it an attractive alternative to irc.
07:54:50 <BCoppens> koi8-r?
07:54:58 <shapr> Also the optional encryption, voice chat, etc are especially nice as compared to irc.
07:55:00 <vincenz> Anyways, it concerns a question regarding ghc
07:55:06 <BCoppens> there's also koi8-u apparently
07:55:18 <ihope> Ah, now it works.
07:55:33 * ihope hopes he's not talking gibberish :-P
07:55:36 <vincenz> Anyone seen Philippa?
07:55:45 <vincenz> @seen Philippa
07:55:46 <lambdabot> I saw Philippa leaving #scannedinavian, #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell 19 hours, 52 minutes and 32 seconds ago, and .
07:55:47 <BCoppens> ihope: nah, the lower part of ASCII usually keeps working ;)
07:55:58 <ihope> Not for UTF-16 :-)
07:56:03 <shapr> BCoppens: hah
07:56:08 <BCoppens> ihope: yeah, hence 'usually' ;)
07:56:12 <BCoppens> :P
07:56:25 <alar> is Philippa scandinavian?
07:56:26 <vincenz> Regarding GHC
07:57:01 <shapr> alar: #ScannedInAvian is a shapr and ScannedInAvian.com chat channel.
07:57:10 <shapr> All sorts of weird discussions happen there.
07:57:20 <vincenz> assume some declaration 'foo x (y,z) = ...'  This will be changed into foo = (\x -> \some -> case some of (y,z) -> ...)    What I'm curious about is basically what to use for the name "some"
07:57:34 <vincenz> @seen ndm
07:57:35 <lambdabot> I saw ndm leaving #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell 15 hours, 2 minutes and 35 seconds ago, and .
07:58:00 <greenrd> What's with the ", and ."?
07:58:22 <Kasperle> haha. everybody keeps asking htat
07:58:23 <BCoppens> I'd say a bug ;)
07:58:27 <Kasperle> that ... 
07:58:28 <vincenz> anyone?
07:58:53 <alar> shapr: is discussion here not weird enough? :)
07:59:03 <shapr> Not always
08:00:28 <shapr> When I'd been living with a woman for five years I told her that I was trying to get both halves of my brain to operate separately by consciously dissassociating my corpus callosum.
08:00:35 <vincenz> ..
08:00:48 <shapr> She freaked out. I later realized probably counts as a weird discussion.
08:01:32 <BCoppens> vincenz: I'm a haskell beginner, I can't help you :(
08:02:06 <shapr> alar: What do you think, is that sufficiently weird? ;-)
08:02:15 <SamB> vincenz: gensym!
08:04:14 <SamB> yay! I finally got openjade built with debug symbols!
08:05:04 <vincenz> samb: great ...
08:05:05 <alar> I think it is interesting
08:05:38 * alar seen this sort of talk in #haskell-blah
08:05:52 <vincenz> samb: that's very useless
08:05:58 <SamB> vincenz: oh really?
08:06:22 <SamB> I already built libosp5 that way
08:06:50 <vincenz> samb: yes it is because gensym does not mention anything regarding the routine gensym uses to generate a name, nor on how it avoids collision
08:06:55 <SamB> oh, gensym
08:07:23 <SamB> well, you could look at what GHC does
08:07:30 <vincenz> hence my asking
08:07:33 <vincenz> cause I wouldn't know wher eto look
08:07:38 <SamB> me either
08:07:44 <vincenz> then don't answer
08:09:20 <petekaz> Who wants to see my lambdabot plugin in action?

08:12:34 <petekaz> dons: I have a few comments in there for you, perhaps you could take a peek for me.  I also would appreciate any comments on coding style as this would be my first real haskell program.
08:12:36 <SamB> vincenz: well, I say this after getting results for such a grep
08:13:18 <SamB> hmm, doesn't seem to be the main way that GHC generates symbols
08:13:18 <dons> petekaz: yep. ok. if you send it in, i can comment on it

08:18:28 <dons> dmhouse: hmm. maybe?
08:18:46 <dons> do a darcs pull and see.
08:18:51 <dmhouse> hmm, good idea.
08:18:53 <dons> otherwise, there's nothing in my inbox.
08:19:08 <dmhouse> There were about five in the bundle.
08:19:23 <dmhouse> Oh, yeah, you've applied (and a fix :))
08:19:40 <petekaz> dons: it also follows redirects too!
08:20:12 <dons> petekaz: excellent
08:21:44 <vincenz> dons: can we get a temporary lambdabot in #oasis?
08:21:54 <dmhouse> dons, might you consider moving Config.hs to Config.hs.sample or something? I keep getting conflicts when I darcs pull because I've changed the config for my personal use.
08:22:00 <dons> @join #oasis
08:22:02 <vincenz> thx
08:22:08 * dmhouse wonders if there's a darcs-level solution to this problem
08:22:17 <dons> dmhouse: oh, just apply and merge
08:22:46 <dons> we'll come up with a better fix for the Config.hs issue i think, so its not compiled in
08:22:53 <dmhouse> right
08:23:04 <dmhouse> perhaps read an INI-style file (or something similar)?
08:23:19 <dmhouse> Haskell's syntax is a bit too flexible to allow serious parsing
08:23:28 <dmhouse> unless you want to get really serious about it
08:23:48 <ihope> Let's try that again.
08:24:20 <dons> dmhouse: no, just use Read/Show
08:24:22 <dmhouse> EagleBot: help
08:24:33 <dmhouse> ihope, what does it do?
08:24:38 <ihope> EagleBot has only one command, and only I can use it :-P
08:24:46 <ihope> #raw PRIVMSG #haskell :Foo.
08:24:46 <EagleBot> Foo.
08:24:51 <ihope> Yay, it works!
08:24:56 <dons> is it the sed bot?
08:25:00 <dmhouse> Something you're writing?
08:25:06 <dons> or the rewritten lambdabot core you hacked on?
08:25:22 <ihope> dons: nah, telnet doesn't work through pipes, it seems.
08:25:30 <vincenz> any pattern for
08:25:35 <ihope> This is all Haskell, written from scratch.
08:25:36 <vincenz> map concat $ sequence $ ?
08:25:54 <dons> petekaz, i'll apply and respond to the patch in the morning. bit late now
08:26:20 <dmhouse> petekaz: what is this a patch for?
08:26:28 <dmhouse> @pl map concat . sequence
08:26:28 <lambdabot> map join . sequence
08:26:38 <ihope> It's also supposed to reply to a CTCP VERSION, but it seems to, like, not.
08:26:38 <dons> dmhouse: see above, the url chasing plugin
08:27:20 <dmhouse> Ah, an HWN is coming. Good stuff. :)
08:28:07 <petekaz> dons: ok.
08:28:39 <dmhouse> petekaz: ooh, nice :)
08:28:42 <vincenz> > drop 1000 $ let vars = ["__"] ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, map return ['a'..'z']]) in vars

08:29:02 <dons> vincenz: very nice.
08:29:12 <vincenz> lexicographic :)
08:29:20 <dons> > take 10 let vars = ["__"] ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, map return ['a'..'z']]) in vars
08:29:21 <lambdabot>  Parse error
08:29:23 <vincenz> given an initial set... keep adding [a..z]
08:29:31 <dmhouse> vincenz: now write a fix version
08:29:32 <dons> > take 10 $ let vars = ["__"] ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, map return ['a'..'z']]) in vars
08:29:33 <lambdabot>  ["__","__a","__b","__c","__d","__e","__f","__g","__h","__i"]
08:29:38 <vincenz> dmhouse: no point
08:29:53 <vincenz> dons: first one letter, then two letters, then three...
08:29:58 <dons> > take 10 $ fix $ \vars -> ["__"] ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, map return ['a'..'z']])
08:29:59 <lambdabot>  ["__","__a","__b","__c","__d","__e","__f","__g","__h","__i"]
08:30:03 <vincenz> dons: ordered lexicographically
08:30:15 <vincenz> could prolly higher-order it
08:30:16 <dons> had to write similar-ish code recently
08:30:18 <vincenz> and take out the initial list
08:30:20 <dons> @freshname
08:30:21 <lambdabot> Hac
08:30:22 <dons> @freshname
08:30:22 <lambdabot> Had
08:30:23 <dons> @freshname
08:30:24 <lambdabot> Hae
08:30:25 <dons> :)
08:30:27 <vincenz> :)
08:30:28 <dons> but not as nice as this
08:30:41 <dons> would you like to patch the @freshname plugin?
08:30:44 <vincenz> sure
08:30:59 <dons> ?version
08:31:00 <lambdabot> lambdabot 3.1p108, GHC 6.5 (OpenBSD i386 )
08:31:00 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
08:31:30 <dons> tweak Plugin/Fresh.hs to use your freshname, instead of the one i've got there
08:31:50 <dons> oh, the issue is that you need to store a seed in the state,
08:31:59 <dons> so you could store the unevaluated rest of the list
08:32:24 <vincenz> > let makeGen inits tails = fix (\vars -> inits ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, tails])) in makeGen ["H"] (map return ['a'..'z'])
08:32:24 <dons> yeah, i should have done it that way. thinking too low level when i wrote freshanem
08:32:29 <lambdabot>  ["H","Ha","Hb","Hc","Hd","He","Hf","Hg","Hh","Hi","Hj","Hk","Hl","Hm","Hn","H...
08:32:40 <dons> needs to start with 'Ha'
08:32:56 <vincenz> > let makeGen inits tails = fix (\vars -> inits ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, tails])) in makeGen ["Ha"] (map return ['a'..'z'])
08:33:05 <lambdabot>  ["Ha","Haa","Hab","Hac","Had","Hae","Haf","Hag","Hah","Hai","Haj","Hak","Hal"...
08:33:08 <dons> i.e. a valid haskell project name ;)
08:33:18 <dons> ok/ /me patches
08:33:19 <vincenz> is "Ha" allowed?
08:33:23 <dons> it'll do.
08:33:28 <dons> or we can just pop that off
08:33:31 <vincenz> yeah
08:33:48 * dons stores an infinite list of names in the plugin state
08:33:52 * dons loves haskell
08:33:55 <vincenz> Copying patch 117 of 117... done!

08:33:56 <vincenz> darcs failed:  Unapplicable patch!
08:34:04 <vincenz> dons: you gonna do it?
08:34:06 <dons> yep
08:34:09 <vincenz> alright
08:34:10 <vincenz> thx
08:34:29 <vincenz> I had a similar generator before
08:34:35 <vincenz> but it only worked for postpending one specific element
08:34:43 <vincenz> this is much better :D
08:35:28 <dmhouse> dons, it'd be more fun if the name was random
08:36:20 <Spark> why use fix for that
08:36:22 <dmhouse> i.e. pick a random number, then generate a random name with that length
08:36:26 <Spark> i'm probably missing something
08:36:30 <dons> Spark: fix == fun :)
08:36:40 <dmhouse> Spark: no reason, I just think it's nice to illustrate the fix/reclet duality
08:36:43 <Spark> ah ok

08:42:40 <ihope> @time EagleBot
08:42:41 <lambdabot> Local time for EagleBot is Much too late
08:42:45 <ihope> :-P
08:42:58 <dmhouse> Hah. :)
08:43:15 <dmhouse> @tell xerox about the upcoming 
08:43:15 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
08:43:17 <dmhouse> gah.
08:43:35 <ihope> Hee hee.
08:43:46 <dmhouse> @tell xerox about the upcoming #math lecture. Check out freenode's #math's topic.
08:43:46 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
08:44:24 * dons `ap` sleep
08:44:40 <BCoppens> they give lectures in #math? What should I imagine with that?
08:45:05 <dons> maybe we should have haskell lectures?
08:45:17 <dmhouse> You sign on to an IRC channel, and listen. :)
08:45:25 <dmhouse> You ask questions by prefixing them with !.
08:45:41 <BCoppens> ah interesting
08:45:43 <dmhouse> As in, '! Aargh, what you said just made no sense!'.
08:45:49 <dmhouse> dons, that would be wonderful! :)
08:45:51 <BCoppens> and do they talk LaTeX?
08:45:54 <BCoppens> hehe =)
08:45:56 <dmhouse> Hrm, ish.
08:46:17 <dmhouse> We've adopted a latex-ish syntax, but is less straining on the backslash
08:46:26 <BCoppens> ah :)
08:46:33 <dmhouse> so, like { x^2 | x in R }
08:46:46 <dmhouse> or s/|/:/, as you prefer.
08:46:46 <BCoppens> ah nice
08:47:05 <BCoppens> and possible graphics?
08:47:30 <dmhouse> imagebin.org :)
08:47:31 <alkoma> on sequence, how can i get them sorted by the sum (lazily) ... 
08:47:40 <alkoma> sequence [[1,6,2], [2,8,9], [1]]
08:47:52 <alkoma> [[1,2,1],[1,8,1],[1,9,1],[6,2,1],[6,8,1],[6,9,1],[2,2,1],[2,8,1],[2,9,1]] 
08:48:07 <dmhouse> @type sortBy
08:48:08 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
08:48:22 <dmhouse> @type \x y -> sum x `compare` sum y
08:48:23 <lambdabot> forall a. (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [a] -> Ordering
08:48:24 <alkoma> the [6,2,1] comes before [1,8,1]
08:48:48 <BCoppens> dmhouse: cool :)
08:48:50 <dmhouse> alkoma: those two functions might help.
08:48:59 <BCoppens> dmhouse: so what is equilibrium theory?
08:49:13 <dmhouse> BCoppens: no idea :) I intend to find out.
08:49:24 <alkoma> dmhouse: thanks.
08:49:25 <BCoppens> ah =)
08:49:36 <dmhouse> Although it's 1AM GMT. Might have to read the logs.
08:49:45 <BCoppens> dmhouse: 1AM GMT == 3.00CEST?
08:50:25 <dmhouse> @google CEST
08:50:27 <lambdabot> http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/eu/cest.html
08:50:42 <dmhouse> Looks like it.
08:50:57 <dmhouse> I'm not sure whether that 1AM means UTC or BST (our summer time; UTC+1)
08:50:59 * SamB wishes GDB had better support for inlined functions, supposes it isn't very possible...
08:51:18 <BCoppens> and gmt=cst
08:51:32 <BCoppens> yeah so I'll probably be sleeping then ;)
08:52:20 <BCoppens> dmhouse: do they have logs like #haskell?
08:52:49 <dmhouse> They'll probably log the seminars.
08:52:59 <dmhouse> If you're interested, Efnet have done a few in the past.
08:53:04 <dmhouse> @hoogle efnet math seminars
08:53:05 <lambdabot> Did you mean: Efnet Math Seminars
08:53:05 <lambdabot> Prelude.undefined :: a
08:53:05 <lambdabot> Test.QuickCheck.Batch.bottom :: a
08:53:08 <dmhouse> @google efnet math seminars
08:53:11 <lambdabot> http://www.efnet-math.org/w/Seminars
08:53:46 <BCoppens> nice :D
08:53:49 <BCoppens> very cool
08:56:27 <BCoppens> though I wonder if writing some paper on the subject wouldn't make it more readable afterwards
08:57:10 <dmhouse> Mmm, yeah, that's been done
08:57:15 <dmhouse> See Kit's Ordinals seminar.
08:57:37 <BCoppens> ah I see them now, thanks :)
08:59:11 <dmhouse> @seen dmhouse
08:59:11 <lambdabot> You are in #oasis and #haskell. I last heard you speak just now.
09:01:48 <dmhouse> @seen jethr0
09:01:48 <lambdabot> I haven't seen jethr0.
09:02:26 <gds> Should warnings prevent lambdabot from building?
09:02:53 <dmhouse> Yep.
09:03:06 <gds> in which case, what should I do about:
09:03:08 <dmhouse> But you shouldn't be getting any warning, unless you've hacked the code.
09:03:18 <gds>     Warning: `IO' is imported more than once:
09:03:18 <gds>                imported from GHC.IOBase at ./Lib/Binary.hs:29:25-30
09:03:18 <gds>                imported from Prelude at Implicit import declaration
09:03:32 <sieni> I've seen the same warnings
09:03:37 <gds> It's a fresh darcs get, as per the instructions on dons' page...
09:03:44 <dmhouse> Hmm.
09:03:50 <sieni> I guess I just disabled the warnings-as-errors thingie :-)
09:04:09 <gds> There's also a newline missing from the end of Tell.hs, but that's more easily fixed ;)
09:04:24 <dmhouse> That shouldn't stop the build, either.
09:04:46 <gds> In which case, I must have something else wrong :/
09:04:58 <LPhas> anyone knows if waitProcessStatus is supposed to block all thread forked with forkOS as blocks ones forked with forkIO on linux and windows? on macosx doesn't
09:06:06 <dmhouse> Hmm. Lambdabot compiles fine for me.
09:06:10 <dmhouse> gds, which version of GHC?
09:07:34 <gds> [gds@silverplume lambdabot]$ ghc --version
09:07:34 <gds> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.4
09:07:53 <dmhouse> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.4.1
09:07:58 <dmhouse> Perhaps upgrade?
09:08:01 <gds> or "ghc-6.4-2mdk" in mandrake-speak...
09:08:15 <dmhouse> Oh, then you've probably got a newer version than me.
09:08:56 * gds doesn't know if mandrake "-2" means the second time they've tried to package ghc6.4, or if it means ghc6.4.2...
09:09:06 <dmhouse> Hmm.
09:09:20 <dmhouse> Well, see if there's a ghc-6.4.1 package
09:09:26 * gds looks...
09:11:22 * gds finds...
09:11:32 * gds begins the rpm wrestling process...
09:17:20 <kosmikus> finally, the HCAR is released ...
09:17:31 <kosmikus> haskell.org/communities
09:18:18 <dmhouse> kosmikus: You're the editor? Or did you just notice?
09:18:35 <earthy> he is the editor. :)
09:19:06 --- topic: set to '["Haskell Communities & Activities Report, 10th edition", "http://haskell.org/communities/", "Haskell.org SoC projects", "http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/", "Haskell is still the language of choice for discriminating hackers", "logs:", "http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/", "http://www.haskell.org/learning.html", "We put the Funk in Funktion", "Vote on a European #haskell get-together", "http://snappoll.com/poll/84228.php"]' by kosmikus
09:19:21 * dmhouse adds a new name to his internal IRC nick -> Real name lookup table
09:19:27 <kosmikus> earthy: haven't seen you for quite some time :)
09:19:42 <pejo> gds, -2mdk is the revision of ghc-6.4 package. 
09:19:55 <dmhouse> kosmikus: Great!
09:19:58 * dmhouse sets out reading
09:20:14 <gds> pejo: Yeah, I've found ghc-6.4.2-3mdk now :)
09:20:32 * kosmikus is currently thinking about vistiting Utrecht next week for Iris' defense ...
09:21:46 <Lemmih> Hurrah for HCAR!
09:23:07 <kosmikus> Lemmih: thanks :)
09:23:20 <ihope> So how do pattern guards work?
09:23:36 <dmhouse> Pattern matches = true, pattern doesn't match = false
09:23:48 <dmhouse> that plus binding of variables, and that's it.
09:24:19 <ihope> So I could do something like "foo x | f x == Just y = g y"?
09:24:33 * gds fails to build lambdabot even with the ghc 6.4.2
09:24:39 * gds tries a fresh checkout...
09:27:16 <kosmikus> ihope: well, not with this syntax
09:27:26 <ihope> Um...
09:28:06 <kosmikus> foo x | Just y <- f x = g y
09:28:10 <kosmikus> is what you probably mean
09:29:56 * gds finally successfully builds
09:29:58 <gds> Yay:)
09:30:31 <Stinger_> so whats so neat about lambdabot anyway
09:30:50 <gds> Nothing yet - I just wanted to make the default one build before I started adding things :)
09:31:03 <Stinger_> everyones doing it though :P
09:31:18 <gds> What's the ettiquette for suggesting updates to the readme btw?
09:31:35 <gds> Like adding the "./Setup.hs install" line that was missing...
09:33:22 <kosmikus> gds: which readme?
09:34:24 <petekaz> I assume he's referring to lambdabot's.
09:34:32 <gds> The one in the root dir of the lambdabot darcs thingie.
09:34:44 <kosmikus> gds: then just "darcs send" a patch, I guess ...
09:35:04 <gds> dons is happy to accept patches from randoms such as myself then? :)
09:35:06 <gds> Cool :)
09:35:16 <kosmikus> why not?
09:35:25 * SamB wonders how a C++ compiler/linker knows what versions of a templated method it can leave out of an executable
09:35:27 * gds just wanted to check :)
09:35:40 <kosmikus> gds: if it's a reasonable change, he certainly will
09:35:54 <gds> Cool :)
09:35:57 <SamB> gds: as long as they don't seem to be intended to make lambdabot do things he doesn't want it to do
09:36:10 <SamB> her, rather
09:36:52 <kosmikus> bye
09:36:56 * kosmikus &
09:37:57 <eivuokko> SamB, What do you mean?  Maybe it's a bit wrong channel once again... templates with same parameters must have same relevant context as per ODR (one definition rule).
09:38:14 <eivuokko> *template parameters
09:38:58 <eivuokko> It's actually more inlining problem/semantics.
09:39:16 <SamB> and such code would be kind of easy to spot, because most of the things he doesn't want it to do involve what is sent to the channel and/or @eval
09:40:57 <SamB> eivuokko: I mean, how does it know if the method is included in a library with those template args or not?
09:41:15 <gds> away getting food - brb
09:43:57 <Lemmih> Greetings SyntaxNinja.
09:43:57 * gds remembers the "/" this time...
09:44:34 <SyntaxNinja> y0
09:44:54 <eivuokko> SamB, Most templates are inline.  It is also possible to instantiate functions explicitly, which are then linked as usual.  And there's also template exports, but they are not usually implemented or used.

10:05:52 <dmhouse> sinfinity: shapr has a Haskell-run blog or two.
10:06:11 <sinfinity> interesting
10:07:38 <alkoma> does he use HAppS? anyone has the links, I like to check out too ...
10:08:58 <Lemmih> He doesn't use HAppS.
10:10:39 <sinfinity> I guess I'll have to ask him when he is around
10:13:17 <alkoma> found it: http://www.scannedinavian.com/~shae/blog/2005Feb.html  - It says "This blog is written with PLog" 
10:17:07 <dmhouse> Anyone tried out HaRe?
10:21:51 <sinfinity> dmhouse: I haven't
10:22:14 <sinfinity> dmhouse: but it looks interesting
10:23:46 <sinfinity> ok, whenever something like Parsec says it is a "combinator library", what exactly does it mean?
10:25:31 <dmhouse> It's a library of small, atomic functions that you can use to build up more complicated functions, and in the end, programs.
10:25:55 <sinfinity> ok
10:25:58 <sinfinity> cool deal.
10:26:49 <dmhouse> For example, digit is a parsec combinator that parses a digit.
10:27:14 <dmhouse> Combine that with many to make many digit, and you've got a new combinator that parses a string of digits (a number, in other words).
10:28:03 <sinfinity> nice
10:33:14 <sinfinity> alkoma: Here is a wiki-type CGI application: http://www.flippac.org/projects/flippi/
10:35:33 <alkoma> sinfinity: thanks - I will check it out.
10:48:56 <Anil> hi, why do I get the following error:
10:48:57 <Anil> Loading package base-1.0 ... linking ... done.
10:48:57 <Anil> ghc-6.4.2: could not execute: ./BotPP
10:50:19 <Anil> Cale - any idea?
10:50:32 <Cale> hmm
10:51:01 <Cale> What's your command line to ghci?
10:51:36 <Anil> sh ghci Main.hs
10:51:49 <dmhouse> Anil: try chown +x ./BotPP
10:51:53 <dmhouse> err, chmod.
10:52:00 <dmhouse> chmod +x ./BotPP
10:52:22 <Cale> sh?
10:52:38 <dmhouse> Cale: alleviates the need for a chmod, normally.
10:53:04 <dmhouse> Cale, and ghci isn't global ghci, it's a script that preprocesses the Lambdabot source so GHCi can grok it.
10:53:12 <dmhouse> BotPP is the preprocessor.
10:53:13 <Cale> oh
10:53:23 <Cale> okay, I didn't have that context :)
10:53:24 <Anil> hah
10:53:25 <Anil> chmod: cannot access `./BotPP': No such file or directory
10:53:34 <dmhouse> Ah, I know what's going on.
10:53:37 <dmhouse> Anil, give me a minute.
10:53:40 <Anil> sure
10:53:43 <Anil> thanks for all the help
10:54:56 <dmhouse> Anil: find -name 'BotPP'
10:55:25 <Anil> no results
10:55:36 <dmhouse> hmm.
10:55:40 <dmhouse> Try building it first then.
10:55:51 <dmhouse> sh Setup.hs configure; sh Setup.hs build
10:55:58 <dmhouse> then try the sh ghci Main.hs ahain
10:56:00 <dmhouse> *again
10:56:12 <Cale> shouldn't that be  runhaskell ?
10:56:19 <Cale> runhaskell Setup.hs configure
10:56:51 <dmhouse> sh will work too, it uses a she-bang.
10:57:18 <Anil> I did what cale said and I get this: Setup.hs: cannot satisfy dependency plugins>=1.0
10:57:51 <dmhouse> You need a newer hs-plugins.
10:58:05 <Anil> sorry, but where do I get it?
10:58:13 <dmhouse> @where hs-plugins
10:58:13 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
10:58:18 <Anil> I just donwloaded from darcs
10:59:06 <Anil> so, Irename the folder as Plugin/ I assume?
10:59:12 <dmhouse> No, no.
10:59:22 <dmhouse> hs-plugins and Plugin are two different things.
10:59:22 <LordBrain> does runghc compile it?
10:59:32 <Anil> oh good
10:59:42 <dmhouse> hs-plugns is a Haskell library, Plugin/ is the directory with all the lambdabot plugins.;
10:59:57 <dmhouse> You need to download hs-plugins seperately.
11:03:36 <Anil> Rebuilding dependencies ... Could not find module `Language.Haskell.Hsx':
11:03:36 <Lokadin> say for some reason i can't seem to import Directory
11:03:50 <dmhouse> Lokadin: isn't it System.Directory?
11:04:03 <Lokadin> dmhouse: oh really? thanks :) 
11:04:46 <Anil> any idea dmhouse?
11:05:16 <dmhouse> Hmm.
11:05:21 <dmhouse> Is that the whole error?
11:06:00 <Anil> Rebuilding dependencies ... Could not find module `Language.Haskell.Hsx': use -v to see a list of the files searched for (imported from System/Plugins/Parser.hs)
11:06:04 <Anil> rm: cannot remove `depend': No such file or directory
11:06:39 <dmhouse> Is this building hs-plugins or lambdabot?
11:06:48 <Anil> hs-plugins
11:07:10 <dmhouse> Does it have a README?
11:07:22 <Lokadin> hoogle doesfileexist
11:07:23 <Anil> yep
11:07:30 <Lokadin> @hoogle doesfileexist
11:07:31 <lambdabot> Directory.doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO Bool
11:07:54 <dmhouse> Anil: what command did you use to start the hs-plugins build?
11:08:06 <Anil> i did ./configure and it went fine
11:08:08 <Anil> then I did make
11:08:14 <Anil> then comes the error
11:08:21 <dmhouse> hmm, okay
11:08:25 <dmhouse> try these commands:
11:08:27 <dmhouse> make clean
11:08:35 <dmhouse> chmod +x Setup.lhs
11:08:40 <dmhouse> ./Setup.lhs configure
11:08:43 <dmhouse> ./Setup.lhs build
11:08:55 <dmhouse> sudo ./Setup.lhs install
11:09:08 <Lokadin> hmmm can i do. doesFileExist "~/.distmud/map.hsdb"
11:09:10 <Lokadin> ?
11:09:21 <dmhouse> Lokadin: should be able to,
11:09:31 <Lokadin> because it returns that it does not exist even though i have created it
11:10:28 <dmhouse> Try the absolute path (although I would expect yours to work)
11:10:36 <Lokadin> it worked with absolute path ):
11:10:40 <Lokadin> :)
11:10:53 <Lokadin> though that's still a lil odd i think
11:11:27 <dmhouse> Lokadin: make sure you're not running the script as some weird user?
11:11:34 <dmhouse> Perhaps there's a limitation with the library though.
11:12:13 <Anil> what does this mean: : no happy preprocessor available? I need some type of pre-processor?
11:12:34 <dmhouse> Anil, that's not an error, is it?
11:12:50 <Anil> yep it is, when I am trying to install haskell-src-exts
11:13:01 <Anil> which is needed for hs-plugins
11:13:22 <dmhouse> It's not
11:13:37 <dmhouse> Not unless you want haskell-src-exts support.
11:13:39 <Lokadin> dmhouse: er well i'm running it as the same user who's home directory it is
11:13:43 <dmhouse> Which isn't mandatory.
11:15:19 <Lokadin> say if i have a type Map = [Cell] and data Cell = {info :: String }, how do i get the contents of info from a Map type, say if instance is called map1
11:15:53 <Cale> Lokadin: you mean a list of all the infos?
11:16:03 <Cale> map info
11:16:18 <Lokadin> Cale: well i would want just a single one of the info's at a time but i'll try that for now
11:17:19 <dmhouse> I need another textbook name.
11:17:29 <dmhouse> I've used Bob, Fred, Alice and Jane.
11:18:39 <dfeuer> Lokadin, I've written you a ticket for apostrophe abuse.  You are sentenced to read Bob the Angry Flower's Guide to the Apostrophe
11:19:04 <Lokadin> dfeuer: lol :)
11:20:31 <Lokadin> say,  with types, i just have to list the input and the output, so say something that would return a Map from a file needing the filename as an argument would be :: FilePath -> IO Map
11:22:18 <dfeuer> Zoundz aboud ride.
11:22:21 <Lokadin> cause it tells me instead of IO Map it wants, IO ((Cell -> String) -> String)
11:22:33 <dfeuer> Well then, that's what id wands.
11:22:56 <Lokadin> er that's the expected type rather
11:23:18 <dmhouse> Weird type.
11:23:36 <dmhouse> I doubt that's the type _you_ want, no matter what the compiler tells you.
11:23:49 <dfeuer> Lokadin, take a look at this:  http://angryflower.com/aposter.html
11:24:27 <dmhouse> @karma+ dfeuer
11:24:27 <lambdabot> dfeuer's karma raised to 1.
11:25:09 <dfeuer> Thanks, dmhouse 
11:25:19 <dmhouse> :)
11:25:33 <dfeuer> @dharma+ Lokadin 
11:25:34 <lambdabot> Lokadin's karma raised to 1.
11:25:38 <dfeuer> hm?
11:25:48 <dfeuer> @dharma- Lokadin 
11:25:48 <lambdabot> Lokadin's karma lowered to 0.
11:25:55 <Anil> I am trying to build greencard and I get this error: ghc-6.4.2: unrecognised flags: -fno-prune-tydecls
11:26:00 <dfeuer> dharma != karma....
11:26:12 <Lokadin> what's dharma?
11:26:29 <Anil> means the right thing
11:26:30 <dfeuer> http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dharma
11:26:36 <dmhouse> Anil, you don't need all that software to install lambdabot.
11:26:47 <dmhouse> you can just ignore the 'XXX not found' output from configure.
11:26:58 <Anil> oh
11:27:06 <Anil> shoot, I dug my self up into this mess
11:29:16 <Lokadin> dfeuer: how could dharma be applied to people?
11:29:39 <Lokadin> karma i understand, but dharma is just confusing
11:30:09 <Lokadin> "the principle or law that orders the universe"
11:30:43 <Lokadin> brb
11:30:51 <Anil> dmhouse - hs-plugins has no such file --> 1150135694 14:08:14 < dmhouse> chmod +x Setup.lhs

11:53:13 <bringert> morning #haskell
11:53:29 <dmhouse> hey bringert.
11:54:41 <bringert> can anyone see what I say? (this new irc client version seems flaky)
11:57:40 <alkoma> your irc client seems fine :)
11:58:33 <Lokadin> readCurrent :: Map ->  IO ()
11:58:33 <Lokadin> readCurrent mapp = putStrLn $ mapp info
11:58:42 <Lokadin> mapp applied to too many arguments :)
11:58:44 <Lokadin> :(*
11:58:52 <Lokadin> Cale: 
11:59:29 <Cale> don't you want it the other way around?
11:59:40 <Cale> and isn't a Map a list of things which you could apply info to?
12:00:17 <Lokadin> yea
12:00:34 <Lokadin> Map = [Cell] and Cell has a spot for info
12:01:04 <Lokadin> i made, info mapp, but now it complains that it couldn't match type Cell to Map
12:01:45 <Lokadin> would i first have to extract one of the Cell's from map?
12:01:52 <dmhouse> @type (!!)

12:02:07 <lambdabot>  1
12:02:23 <Lokadin> well that compiles
12:03:19 <Lokadin> but says, distmud: Prelude.read: no parse
12:03:25 <Lokadin> at runtime
12:03:38 <Lokadin> hmmm, maybe something wrong with map, i don't think there is anything in it
12:05:01 <Lokadin> okay well i g2 bbl thanks for all the help :)
12:13:44 <sinfinity> are there any string algorithm libraries that include things such as Levenshtein distance?
12:15:06 <dmhouse> I _know_ I've seen such an algorithm.
12:15:12 <dmhouse> @hoogle Licensed Prelude Exts
12:15:13 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
12:15:14 <dmhouse> gah
12:15:17 <dmhouse> @google Licensed Prelude Exts
12:15:18 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/communities/05-2005/html/report.html
12:15:30 <dmhouse> @oldwiki LicensedPreludeExts
12:15:30 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LicensedPreludeExts
12:15:42 <dmhouse> sinfinity: try that one. If it isn't there, try PreludeExts.
12:15:56 <sinfinity> dmhouse: alright, thanks :D
12:20:03 <sinfinity> dmhouse: I found an implementation in the lambdabot Util.hs
12:20:12 <dmhouse> That's where, then.
12:35:57 <vincenz> what happened?
12:39:04 * dfeuer scrolls back and sees _another_ violation of the apostrophe by Lokadin 
12:39:24 <dfeuer> Lokadin, did you not read the page I linked to?
13:03:04 <sinfinity> Are there any data mining libraries written in Haskell?
13:04:34 <sinfinity> I'm leaning towards using a Python library I'm familiar with since I can't find any in haskell
13:35:27 <dmhouse> Anyone built HaRe?
13:39:22 <vincenz> re
13:39:50 <astrolabe> @eval 2
13:40:10 <astrolabe> bah
13:40:16 <vincenz> > 2
13:40:17 <lambdabot>  2
13:40:21 <astrolabe> heh
13:41:03 <astrolabe> something's wrong with lambdabot
13:41:09 <astrolabe> vincenz is fine though
13:43:46 <dmhouse> astrolabe: no, @eval just doesn't do anything
13:43:47 <dmhouse> @run 2
13:43:48 <lambdabot>  2
13:43:54 <dmhouse> @help eval
13:43:55 <lambdabot> eval. Do nothing (perversely)
13:43:58 <dmhouse> @help run
13:43:58 <lambdabot> run <expr>
13:43:59 <lambdabot> You have Haskell, 3 seconds and no IO. Go nuts!
13:44:18 <dmhouse> Not sure why dons changed that command, but, hey.
13:44:22 <astrolabe> oh, they've disabled it?
13:44:25 <astrolabe> thanks
13:45:21 <dmhouse> astrolabe: nah, it's got renamed to @run.
13:50:12 <vincenz> is it feasible to make a class definition wit no methods?

13:52:49 <aFlag> just leave the where out
13:53:46 <vincenz> yep
13:53:48 <vincenz> great \o/
13:53:57 <vincenz> super useful

13:54:24 <vincenz> myfunction :: (Plop a b c) => ...
13:55:30 <dmhouse> Is the following correct grammar? 'Not knowing whom to address this email...'. I'm not sure where to put the 'whom'. It doesn't sound quite right where it is
13:55:50 <vincenz> Not knowing whom to address this email to
13:55:57 <vincenz> ...
13:56:08 <dmhouse> or perhaps 'to whom'
13:56:13 <vincenz> no
13:56:31 * vincenz randompastes a line from his interpreter
13:56:31 <vincenz>         HBlackhole    -> fail "BLACKHOLE"
13:56:47 <dmhouse> 'Not knowing to whom to address this email'. Sounds right.
13:56:53 <vincenz> dmhouse: it depends
13:57:10 <vincenz> "Now knowing whom to address this email to, I decided to blabla" is correct
13:57:30 <vincenz> 'I therefore did xxx, not knowing whom to address this email to"
13:57:33 <vincenz> I doubt yours is correct
13:57:44 <dcoutts> oh but the deamons of "thou shalt not end a sentance with a preposition" will get you!
13:58:18 <dmhouse> What does ending a clause with a preposition do then? Send you to limbo?
13:58:27 <dmhouse> A semi-cardinal sin. :)
13:58:39 <dcoutts> who knows, but it must be bad
13:58:55 <dcoutts> and the not knowing makes it worse (as with all good fears :-) )
13:59:11 <astrolabe> 'Not knowing to whom to address this email ...'
13:59:44 <vincenz> astrolabe: that's incorrect
13:59:47 <astrolabe> Or for something informal, don't worry about the 'to' at the end
13:59:47 <vincenz> it
13:59:51 <kzm_> Is the FFI limited to functions that do not clash with other c functions?
13:59:55 <vincenz> "not knowing whom TO address this email TO"
14:00:00 <astrolabe> vincenz: I disagree
14:00:12 <vincenz> astrolabe: you have that right
14:00:28 <kzm_> In my case, I'm trying to link in a c lib defining "count".  Which clashes with something from base_cbits, probably used by fps.
14:00:43 <aFlag> just write whatever and on the end of the text say "sorry about mi english ^^"
14:01:01 <dcoutts> kzm_, yes that is a problem, in this case we're changing the name of the fps C function
14:01:33 <dcoutts> kzm_, it's already fixed in fps head, and will get into ghc base soonish
14:01:37 <kzm_> okay.  In that case, I've "solved" my linking problem.
14:01:56 <dcoutts> the C & linker namespace is flat, which is a problem sometimes
14:01:59 <kzm_> by 'ar r *.o'ing everything into the libHSfoo.a.  Whee.
14:02:29 <kzm_> So any c lib going into the std libs should do their own mangling, I suppose.
14:02:56 <dcoutts> well all the ghc rts functions use a prefix
14:03:29 <kzm_> vincenz, notice that "knowing to whom to address" the second "to" is the article, not the preposition.  Having "to" at the end is superfluous.
14:03:47 <dcoutts> and ghc mangles the names of haskell functions into linker names
14:04:00 * kzm_ didn't read it carefully enough.  Sorry.
14:04:45 <kzm_> dcoutts, how soon is soonish?  If it's not very soonish, I might mangle my own library.
14:05:33 <kzm_> ...or put a modern fps into my ghc build, perhaps.
14:05:47 <kzm_> the one in current "cvs" is getting long in the tooth.

14:18:03 <SamB> so apparantly I can debug C++ programs
14:18:13 <Anil> gdb?
14:19:20 <SamB> with GDB, yeah. but I meant that apparantly I can actually *find* bugs sometimes
14:19:49 <SamB> and actually I was using DDD
14:20:47 <aFlag> i like good old plain gdb
14:22:10 <SamB> DDD is a very good GDB frontend, though
14:24:03 <SamB> it doesn't seem to get confused by input on the GDB Console, and it has such nice things as a source/disassembly window and a data display window as well
14:24:23 <vincenz> @type zipWith
14:24:24 <lambdabot> forall c b a. (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

14:26:40 <SamB> and what displays you've had up
14:29:22 <dreamEye> Someone know how to do something when a haskell program is being killed in windows?
14:29:40 <dreamEye> I have to store data from a cache....
14:30:19 <SamB> dreamEye: how do you do that with a C program?
14:30:42 <dreamEye> with signal handlers
14:31:32 <SamB> signal handlers in windows?
14:31:52 <dreamEye> mmm I think so
14:32:15 <dcoutts> dreamEye, catch the exception, do your thing and rethrow
14:32:28 <dcoutts> which is what finally does
14:32:33 <dcoutts> @hoogle finally
14:32:34 <lambdabot> Control.Exception.finally :: IO a -> IO b -> IO a
14:32:36 <dreamEye> but I dont find any exception
14:32:55 <SamB> dreamEye: well, you might try killing GHCi and see what happens
14:33:02 <dcoutts> if the program is killed nicely then it gets an exception

14:33:31 <lambdabot>  Parse error
14:33:33 <dreamEye> but system.Posix is not implemented for Windows in Haskell
14:33:40 <SamB> samx: except the part where dreamEye wants it to work on windows...

16:04:43 <AtnNn> :)
16:05:03 <vincenz> \o/
16:06:17 <astrolabe> Is there a way to force GHC to recompile stuff without deleting the object files?
16:07:19 <bolrod> touching the source files?
16:07:26 <bolrod> :)
16:07:38 <astrolabe> Yeah, that would work, but is a pain.
16:10:30 <bolrod> ofcourse
16:12:30 <eivuokko> Ghc has switch -no-recomp or something like that
16:12:59 <astrolabe> thanks, I'll look
16:14:36 <SamB> hmm, I wonder how to write a crudfilter quickly...
16:15:16 <astrolabe> eivuokko: exactly right
16:16:07 * SamB supposes it is not worth it to sift through bucketloads of HTML pages just to generate a course prerequisite graph
16:20:49 <vincenz> aha!
16:20:51 * vincenz figures out the bug
16:22:10 <bolrod> :o!
16:22:22 * bolrod is probably covered in bugs
16:22:31 <bolrod> dangit

16:41:07 <vincenz> yayyayay
16:41:08 <vincenz> it wokr
16:41:11 <vincenz> works
16:44:35 <bolrod> :D
16:47:09 <bolrod> man.. it's so nice outside.. I don't feel like going to sleep :D
16:49:33 <vincenz> how do you make multiline strings
16:52:45 <SamB> vincenz: perhaps you press enter?
16:52:55 <vincenz> SamB: your answers are always as useless
16:53:08 <SamB> well, lets see
16:53:10 <vincenz> foo = "\
16:53:12 <vincenz> \ lala \
16:53:15 <vincenz> \ bibi \
16:53:16 <vincenz> \"
16:53:20 <vincenz> sadly this does not put in newlines
16:53:38 <SamB> > read "\"foo\nbar\""
16:53:39 <lambdabot>  Add a type signature
16:53:43 <SamB> > read "\"foo\nbar\"" :: String
16:53:44 <lambdabot>  "foo\nbar"
16:54:32 * vincenz smacks SamB upside the head
16:54:35 <vincenz> inside haskell sources!
16:54:55 <SamB> well, lambdabot doesn't take multi-line input
16:55:06 <SamB> and unfortunately that isn't allowed in source files...
16:55:20 <SamB> so, well, you could use unlines ["foo", "bar"]
16:55:21 <vincenz> don't tell me that
16:55:35 * SamB didn't know until he tried it
16:57:44 <vincenz> reduce/reduce conflicts: 17
16:57:48 <vincenz> :(
17:03:29 <bolrod> ?
17:03:35 <vincenz> nm
17:03:36 <vincenz> fixed
17:04:26 <bolrod> man.. I could just fall asleep right here :D
17:06:07 <SamB> so, how come you aren't allowed to write string literals with embedded newlines?
17:06:37 <bolrod> ?
17:07:26 <bolrod> what's the use of newlines in lambdabot
17:07:44 <bolrod> don't you think one line is invasive enough?
17:07:48 <SamB> no, not in lambdabot
17:07:53 <SamB> in Haskell period
17:08:00 <bolrod> ?
17:08:15 <bolrod> > ord '\n'
17:08:16 <lambdabot>  10
17:08:41 <SamB> no, I mean you can't write code like this:
17:08:50 <SamB> s = "foo
17:08:50 <SamB> bar"
17:09:01 <bolrod> true
17:09:10 <jgrimes> "foo\

17:09:48 <lambdabot>  '\n'
17:10:21 <bolrod> > read ("test"++'\n':"hahahah") ::String
17:10:22 <lambdabot>  Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
17:10:26 <bolrod> wtf?
17:10:34 <bolrod> > read ("hahahah") ::String
17:10:35 <lambdabot>  Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
17:11:03 <bolrod> > read "hahahah" ::String
17:11:04 <lambdabot>  Exception: Prelude.read: no parse

17:11:12 <lambdabot>  Parse error
17:11:17 <jcreigh> > read "\"hahaha\"" :: String
17:11:18 <bolrod> oh
17:11:19 <lambdabot>  "hahaha"
17:12:03 <bolrod> > read   ("\"" ++ '\n':"hahahah\"" )::String
17:12:04 <lambdabot>  "\nhahahah"
17:12:08 <bolrod> O_o?
17:12:15 <SamB> jgrimes: trouble with that is that you get "foobar"
17:12:36 <jgrimes> SamB, what did you intend it to say?
17:13:31 <SamB> well, vincenz wants to be able to write multi-line string literals
17:16:02 <jgrimes> SamB, so that it takes up multiple lines when shown?
17:17:12 <SamB> jgrimes: yeah
17:19:26 <jgrimes> SamB, if you do something like:
17:19:36 <jgrimes> t = putStrLn "foo\n\
17:19:41 <jgrimes> \bar"
17:19:53 <jgrimes> it prints on multiple lines

17:57:47 <Cale> int-e: it's actually kind of fun to use that one recursively to build a tree
17:58:53 <bolrod> O_o?
17:59:39 <bolrod> how does the groupBy (>)  work?
17:59:42 <Cale> You can rebuild a tree from an preorder traversal of the depth of each node like that.
18:00:29 <Cale> well, look up the definition of groupBy
18:00:40 <bolrod> hm.. that might be usefull 8)
18:00:43 * bolrod is a bit lazy now
18:00:54 <Cale> groupBy eq []           =  []

18:02:45 <bolrod> aha!
18:03:49 <jgrimes> SamB, you can also leave out the double '\' at the end and the beginning if you want

18:20:48 <vincenz> dons: it's working
18:20:50 <vincenz> cleaning up my stuff now
18:22:10 <ell-hask> I've noticed some good documents for Haskell testing, but is there a good all around tutorial?
18:22:30 <ell-hask> Or is it best to piece things together from the publications?
18:25:21 <dons> hmm, yeah, read the QuickCheck papers 
18:25:30 <ell-hask> Thanks
18:25:38 <dons> they're all linked on Haskell.org's research papers page
18:25:48 <dons> also, there's an example of using QuickCheck in fps:

18:25:50 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html
18:25:57 <dons> if you want to get an idea how it works

18:26:36 <dons> here, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/talks/qc.ps.gz
18:27:19 <dons> actually, that talk might be what you want. then dive into the papers and the large examples

19:42:55 <darrint> help please: http://haskell.pastebin.com/705742
19:43:10 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "haskell private pastebin - collaborative debugging tool"
19:44:05 <darrint> so it is
19:44:28 <dons> hmm
19:45:11 <dons> looks like you're applying 10.0 to a vector
19:45:38 <dons> your precedence seems to be mixed up in that expr: (rem (ctSec t) 10.0)) * pi / 10.0 (Vector3 1.0 1.0 1.0)
19:45:48 <dons> I suggest you name the components using 'let ' or 'where'
19:46:50 <darrint> If I just add parens for the moment, I get: ERROR "mytest.hs":17 - Unresolved top-level overloading
19:47:31 <dons> ?pretty let v = Vector3 1.0 1.0 1.0 ; secs = (ctSec t) ; rems = (secs `rem` 10) * pi in rotate (fromIntegral rems / 10.0) vec
19:47:31 <lambdabot>  i = let v = Vector3 1.0 1.0 1.0
19:47:32 <lambdabot>      secs = (ctSec t)
19:47:32 <lambdabot>      rems = (secs `rem` 10) * pi
19:47:32 <lambdabot>     in rotate (fromIntegral rems / 10.0) vec
19:47:35 <dons> or something like that
19:48:07 <Korollary> shouldnt secs be indented the same as v ?
19:48:08 <darrint> but the t is unbound until later in a do expression. That's ok?
19:48:27 <darrint> t is type IO CalendarType
19:48:39 * darrint still hasn't experienced the monad epiphany
19:49:20 <dons> Korollary: yeah, ?pretty doesn't quite indent the best
19:49:36 <dons> oh, then you need to evaluate it it first
19:49:46 <dons> ?pretty do r <- t ; .... 
19:49:47 <lambdabot> "Parse error" at column 13
19:49:49 <dons> hehe
19:58:21 <lambda_the_insig> Is it possible to reverse the order of actions in a monad?
19:59:18 <lambda_the_insig> i.e., if I have doThing :: do { print "Hi"; print "How are you?" } ; someT doThing = { print "How are you?"; print "Hi" }
19:59:56 <dons> you could code a reverse monad, certainly, and there are even backtracking monads out there
20:00:22 <dons> its all about abstracting over sequencing of computation
20:00:53 <dons> so you should be able to apply arbitrary transforms to the ordering
20:02:50 <monochrom> In "x >>= f" there is a certain limit to how much you can perform f first.  f is not an action yet.
20:03:11 <lambda_the_insig> In particular, I'm trying to parse backwards; my thought is that I can reverse the input, and then reverse the usual order of the given parser to write a parser which is "attached" to the end of the input.
20:03:20 <dons> yeah, its not easy. writing a backtracking monad is worthy of a research paper
20:03:59 <dons> that's a very interesting idea, lambda_the_insig 
20:08:26 <lambda_the_insig> so, given reverseParser :: Parser a -> Parser a, if we defined someBlock :: Parser a ; someBlock = do { string "block" ; digs <- digits ; string "endblock" ; return digs }; parse reverseParser "blah blah blah blah block1234endblock" => 1234
20:09:48 <monochrom> I think it is still easier to reverse the input string :)
20:10:13 <dons> heh
20:10:15 <lambda_the_insig> so I suppose both the order of the actions would need to be reversed as well as the input/results for each parser; i.e., we're really looking for do { string "kcolbdne"; digs <- digits ; string "kcolb" ; return reverse digs } run on the reversed input
20:11:46 <lambda_the_insig> ah... it's probably not even generally applicable.
20:12:20 <monochrom> There is no "reverseParser :: Parser a -> Parser a" in a very strong sense: it cannot be implemented.  But you can write your own parser monad and code it to work backwards.
20:13:34 * darrint reads frag code and discovers the function "elapsedTime"
20:13:44 <lambda_the_insig> I've been playing with writing a ByteString-based seekable parser based on Parsec, but it's certainly easier to work with things that are already working... :)
20:17:29 <Lokadin> say how do i get this to return a String, it compiles but doesn't seem to give the output of the file : doRead :: String -> IO String
20:17:32 <Lokadin> doRead filename =
20:17:34 <Lokadin>    bracket (openFile filename ReadMode) hClose
20:17:37 <Lokadin>       (\h -> return $ hGetContents h)
20:19:42 <kpreid_> remove the "return $"
20:20:04 <Lokadin> kk one sec 
20:20:19 <kpreid_> return is for when you have an already-computed plain value
20:20:48 <lambda_the_insig> is there an "rtake" which lets you take things from the end of a list?
20:21:01 <lambda_the_insig> as in the last 10 items of a list
20:21:06 <lambda_the_insig> (say)
20:21:18 <int-e> drop if you know the length of the list
20:21:37 <Lokadin> kpreid_: putStrLn =<< doRead "Map.hs" returns nothing :(
20:21:48 <Lokadin> before there was a blank line now there isn't even that
20:21:48 <int-e> > drop 4 "abcdefghijklmnop"
20:21:50 <lambdabot>  "efghijklmnop"
20:22:42 <lambda_the_insig> short of doing a `rtake num list = drop ((length list) - num) list', is there a way of defining this that would not need to traverse the list twice? 
20:22:42 <int-e> well, you close the file before any of the contents is ever used
20:23:04 <int-e> hGetContents is lazy and closes the file itself.
20:24:49 <int-e> @type readFile
20:24:50 <lambdabot> FilePath -> IO String
20:25:12 <_coder_> Is Haskell like O'Caml, in the way that there are no variables?
20:25:23 * _coder_ is a newb to functional languages
20:25:26 <lambda_the_insig> I suppose there's always `rtake n = reverse . take . reverse' :)
20:25:51 <lambda_the_insig> make that reverse . take n . reverse
20:25:54 <_coder_> I'm a language freak... Must learn 'em... design 'em..... code 'em.... ;]
20:26:10 <dons> _coder_: yeah, well, variables don't vary 
20:26:13 <_coder_> But I've never tried a functional language for more than 10 minutes so far
20:26:16 <dons> they're not mutable
20:26:18 <monochrom> You must traverse the list once to find out the end.  During that pass, you cannot start computing the answer yet, as you do not yet know the end.  So there must be a second pass.
20:26:20 <_coder_> Okee... cool.... I guess :P
20:26:23 <Pete_I> haskell has constants
20:26:30 <_coder_> Ah, like Caml
20:26:55 <monochrom> OCaml has variables, and so does Haskell.
20:27:07 <_coder_> Mutable?!
20:27:11 <monochrom> Yes!
20:27:15 <_coder_> (Other than arrays)
20:27:15 <dons> the're s mutable vars if you need them
20:27:16 <_coder_> ?
20:27:24 <dons> just like ML of all flavours
20:27:28 <dons> sometimes they're useful
20:27:28 <Pete_I> why're they called variables if they don't vary?
20:27:40 <_coder_> :P
20:27:52 * _coder_ thinks it'd be odd coding with non-mutable stuff.... 
20:27:54 <dons> but as a default, mutability isn't such a good idea. makes reasoning much much harder
20:27:56 <_coder_> I'll have to see :)
20:28:10 <monochrom> The mutable variables in Haskell come with more restrictions than in other languages.
20:28:28 <_coder_> Does Haskell have bindings to a lot of major libs/apps?  (Bison,Flex,ect.)
20:28:33 <fwfewfwa> they are not mutable just in a function instance....
20:28:34 <_coder_> Ah, I see
20:28:39 <dons> oh, you'd use happy/alex instead
20:28:58 <_coder_> Kewl... I'm interested now :)   I'm obsessed with [programming] languages :P
20:29:04 <dons> but yes, it has a rather amazing FFI standard for writing bindings 
20:29:26 * _coder_ will give haskell a try
20:29:52 <fwfewfwa> haskell sux
20:30:01 <fwfewfwa> better use pure lambda calculi :)
20:33:09 <monochrom> How would you explain mutable variables to a newbie?  Here it is.  To explain the meaning of "n := n + 1", you say, take the old value of n, calculate that value plus 1, the result is your new n.  So already you are converting it back to n_new = n_old + 1.  The cleanest way to give meaning to mutation is to eliminate mutation.
20:33:50 <fwfewfwa> there is an easy way to explain it
20:33:56 <fwfewfwa> you have states
20:34:02 <palomer> STATES?
20:34:12 <fwfewfwa> each imperative program has a current state
20:34:27 <fwfewfwa> after each line is executed, the current state is changed, and we get a new state
20:34:36 <fwfewfwa> the state tells you the current values of all the vars of a program
20:35:00 <monochrom> it also has a past state, a next state, a state before the past state, a state before the next state, ...
20:35:02 <fwfewfwa> when you execute one line, it tells you, new state will be, all vars remain unchanged except this one wich adquires this value:
20:35:11 <fwfewfwa> so?
20:35:24 <fwfewfwa> you dont care about previous states
20:35:34 <fwfewfwa> you just take care about actual state and next state
20:35:47 <fwfewfwa> it also can be matematically defined what i've just say
20:35:52 <fwfewfwa> and give semantic to a language
20:35:58 <fwfewfwa> and prove things with it...
20:36:40 * palomer doesn't like the term "mathematically define"
20:37:07 <palomer> I prefer describe with words which are semantically less extensive
20:37:10 * palomer is off
20:37:22 <lambda_the_insig> @pl rtake n = reverse . take n . reverse
20:37:23 <lambdabot> rtake = (reverse .) . (. reverse) . take
20:38:05 <monochrom> Yes. So now you have a pair of states, "current" and "next", or "past" and "current", or any similar pair.  You now need a relation between them.  To give meaning to the program and to reason about it, you do everything on the relation.  This is functional programming.
20:38:41 <monochrom> For example "n_new = n_old + 1" is such a relation.
20:38:47 <fwfewfwa> it's not functional programming
20:38:54 <fwfewfwa> functional programmint doesn't denote relationships...
20:39:03 <fwfewfwa> they denote functions...
20:39:19 <LordBrain> which are?
20:39:22 <fwfewfwa> so in any case, it would be "logic" programming...
20:39:27 <LordBrain> hmm
20:39:51 <Lokadin> anyway of making this return an IO String? doRead filename =
20:39:51 <Lokadin>    bracket (openFile filename ReadMode) hClose
20:39:51 <Lokadin>       (\h -> hGetContents h)
20:40:00 <monochrom> I have read Richard Bird's book on functional programming.  It is all about relations.
20:40:04 <fwfewfwa> no
20:40:09 <fwfewfwa> or yes
20:40:14 <fwfewfwa> functions are a special case of relations
20:40:17 <monochrom> The book is "Algebra of Programming".
20:40:29 <fwfewfwa> relations are much more powerfull than functions...
20:40:43 <Lokadin> what are relations?
20:40:43 <Cale> Lokadin: you're not supposed to call hClose on a handle which you've called hGetContents on
20:41:17 <Lokadin> Cale: oh, so what should i do? that's what the example does in YAHT
20:41:20 <fwfewfwa> a relationship betwen A and B is a any subset of AxB
20:41:24 <Cale> Lokadin: really?
20:41:30 <fwfewfwa> (there are relations between more sets too)
20:41:31 <LordBrain> does it matter that a "function" in the mathematical sense, is a specialization of "relation" in the mathematical sense?
20:41:40 <Lokadin> Cale: yep section 5.4
20:41:50 <Cale> Let me look
20:41:50 <fwfewfwa> relationships are more powerfull than functions
20:41:56 <fwfewfwa> and cale here, will agree with me :)
20:42:03 <monochrom> When you write a specification, you may like to allow the implementer some freedom in the form of non-determinism, so in general you use a relation; then you gradually refine it to code, and at the end you do get a function.
20:42:22 <Lokadin> Cale: kk
20:42:22 <Cale> fwfewfwa: More general perhaps, more powerful is questionable
20:42:26 <int-e> Lokadin: why don't you just use readFile?
20:42:36 <fwfewfwa> how many functions you need to replace append cale? :)
20:42:38 <Lokadin> @hoogle readFile
20:42:39 <lambdabot> Prelude.readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
20:42:39 <lambdabot> System.Win32.File.c_ReadFile :: HANDLE -> Ptr a -> DWORD -> Ptr DWORD -> LPOVERLAPPED -> IO Bool
20:42:39 <lambdabot> System.Win32.File.win32_ReadFile :: HANDLE -> Ptr a -> DWORD -> Maybe LPOVERLAPPED -> IO DWORD
20:42:40 <sethk> I'm not sure what "powerful" would mean, exactly, in this context
20:42:40 <fwfewfwa> you know that a lot :)
20:43:00 <Lokadin> int-e: oh wow i had no idea such a thing existed thanks :)
20:43:20 <Cale> Lokadin: ah, it does all the IO it wants with the file in that one part there
20:43:30 <fwfewfwa> cale, if you are bored, i can tell you a new and more difficult problem :)
20:43:33 <Cale> Lokadin: still, that's a dangerous way to program
20:43:49 <Cale> Lokadin: yeah, use readFile
20:44:02 <Cale> or just don't call hClose
20:44:25 <LordBrain> i suppose I would expect you could do more with relations, since functions are all themselves relations if either, but not the other way around..
20:44:32 <Cale> you could open the file normally and call hGetContents -- the file will be closed automatically when you're done with the string or you get to the end of the file
20:45:00 <Cale> However, with relations, you have fewer guarantees.
20:45:16 <LordBrain> yeah, unless its a subset of relations
20:45:22 <Lokadin> Cale: thnks .ui
20:45:26 <fwfewfwa> you don't have fewer guarantees
20:45:41 <fwfewfwa> if you need more guarantess, you can define functions wich is a special kind of relationship
20:45:45 <Cale> Functions are a special kind of relation, they give you an extra guarantee about behaviour.
20:46:03 <fwfewfwa> yes, but you don't always need that guarantee....
20:46:12 <Cale> Just like groups are a special kind of monoid, making them nicer in general.
20:46:18 <fwfewfwa> relationships let you choose, functions bound you to do what they want...
20:46:27 <sethk> where can I find documentation about dependent types?  Is that a ghc extension?  I searched for dependent in the users guide but didn't find it.
20:46:28 <fwfewfwa> also, functions aren't reversibles :)
20:46:31 <Cale> relations, not relationships :)
20:46:36 <Cale> hm?
20:46:42 <fwfewfwa> you may need a lot of functions to replace just one relation...
20:46:52 <fwfewfwa> how many functions do you need to replace append?
20:46:56 <int-e> you can always define functions to powersets
20:47:35 <monochrom> That is why, if you want to speak of the inverse of a function, you usually work with relations instead.
20:47:49 <monochrom> This is also covered in Bird's book.
20:47:58 <Cale> nah, I just work with bijective functions :)
20:48:21 <LordBrain> yeah..
20:48:39 <sethk> nobody knows?  Maybe I'm using the wrong terminology.
20:48:41 <LordBrain> what's Bird's book btw?
20:48:49 <monochrom> Algebra of Programming.
20:48:55 <Cale> sethk: Haskell doesn't have dependent types
20:49:04 <Cale> sethk: Look at something like Epigram
20:49:19 <Lokadin> is there a non-ncurses browser?
20:49:31 <Lokadin> er console
20:49:32 <monochrom> firefox :)
20:49:38 <monochrom> darn
20:49:42 <Lokadin> .ui
20:49:50 <Lokadin> :)
20:49:50 <Lokadin> *
20:49:59 <int-e> netcat
20:50:20 <Lokadin> well i could use curl if i just wanted the source
20:50:27 <Pete_I> wget
20:50:39 <sethk> Cale, no, I wasn't thinking that I need dependent types; I thought dons had suggested using them as a solution to a problem we were talking about
20:50:45 <Lokadin> i mean something like lynx, but not-ncurses based
20:50:47 <sethk> Cale, I must not be using the right term
20:51:16 <sethk> @seen dons
20:51:17 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I last heard dons speak 22 minutes and 12 seconds ago.
20:51:17 <int-e> functional dependencies, maybe?
20:51:37 <LordBrain> ah i asked about functional dependencies just yesterday
20:51:40 <sethk> int-e, possibly.  I'll look that up and see if it fits the context.  thanks.
20:51:41 <Cale> sethk: yeah, maybe functional dependencies
20:53:09 <sethk> Cale, int-e, yes, functional dependencies fit.  I guess I finally have to figure out what the forall construct really means.
20:53:30 <sethk> it confuses me because I don't see why it isn'
20:53:38 <sethk> why it isn't forall even without the forall keyword
20:54:01 <sethk> I mean I don't see a restriction in the declaration without the forall.  I'll read the doc and see if that clarifies it.
20:55:11 <sethk> well, right at the beginning of the section it talks about forall being implicit, so I'm not being totally stupid, just partially stupid.  :)
20:55:33 <Cale> hm?
20:55:51 <Pete_I> if function can't have side-effects in haskell...how can let be a function?
20:56:01 <fwfewfwa> so cale do you want a problem? :)
20:56:02 <Cale> Pete_I: let doesn't have side effects
20:56:17 <Pete_I> ...
20:56:31 <Pete_I> what about the = function then
20:56:34 <int-e> it'
20:56:38 <int-e> s not a function
20:56:41 <Cale> Pete_I: Type variables are universally quantified by default, but they go out of scope outside the type signature without the explicit forall
20:56:46 <Pete_I> what is it?
20:56:49 <Cale> er
20:56:57 <Cale> Sorry, that was to sethk 
20:57:06 <Cale> Pete_I: = is not a function
20:57:07 <Pete_I> i noticed, it's fine.
20:57:15 <Pete_I> Cale, then what is it?
20:57:15 <sethk> Cale, right, that's what I was reading and I said that forall is implicit in some cases
20:57:16 <int-e> let a = b isn't an assignment. it's a declaration, it binds b to a.
20:57:19 <Cale> Let introduces some local declarations
20:57:47 <sethk> Cale, actually it says all free type variables, not all type variables, although I guess a bound type variable would be a peculiar construct.
20:57:48 <Cale> > let evens = 0 : map (1+) odds; odds = map (1+) evens in evens
20:57:49 <lambdabot>  [0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,...
20:58:05 <Cale> sethk: yeah, sorry, that's just me forgetting to be precise :)
20:58:20 <Cale> Pete_I: look at that example
20:58:30 <int-e> sethk: forall a.a has a as a bound type variable.
20:58:31 <sethk> Cale, I guess this part about "except for the class type variables in a class declaration" is significant
20:58:33 <Cale> Pete_I: It can't be assignment because they're mutually recursive.
20:58:45 <Pete_I> ok
20:58:49 <sethk> int-e, it isn't talking about it being bound in a forall contstruct
20:58:58 <sethk> int-e, it is talking about not needing the forall when it is free
20:59:13 <sethk> int-e, so clearly whether forall is implicit cannot have anything to do with something bound by forall itself
20:59:20 <LordBrain> oh you dont need {} in that let? because its all on the same line... ah...
20:59:35 <LordBrain> the little things i learn here
21:00:01 <sethk> LordBrain, you can always use the explicit constructs instead of layout
21:00:13 <sethk> LordBrain, and if you use layout, the explicit constructs are never required
21:00:26 <sethk> LordBrain, although in many cases the corresponding layout is seriously ugly
21:00:36 <LordBrain> yeah i know.. i just thought you would need the {} for some reason.. i guess i didnt think about it.
21:00:36 <sethk> and using {} let's me be lazy, which is good.  :)
21:01:03 <LordBrain> no i mean, if its all on the same line you can get away without the {} and just separate with semicolons
21:01:19 <LordBrain> i should have realized that.. but i didn't until now
21:09:55 <palomer> @pl y f = f (y f)
21:09:56 <lambdabot> y = fix (ap id)
21:10:12 <palomer> eh?
21:10:17 <palomer> shouldn't it be y = fix ?
21:10:22 <palomer> @type ap id
21:10:23 <lambdabot> forall a b. ((a -> b) -> a) -> (a -> b) -> b
21:11:22 <monochrom> @type fix
21:11:23 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> a) -> a
21:11:41 <monochrom> dunno
21:13:13 <palomer> @type fix (ap id)
21:13:14 <lambdabot> forall b. (b -> b) -> b
21:13:29 <palomer> ap id is a fixed point of fix?
21:13:46 <_coder_> Hmmmm... the only thing I've gotten to work without errors on the ghci program is a comment  XD
21:14:00 <palomer> comments are overrated
21:14:04 <palomer> we should do away with them
21:14:33 <_coder_> let { fac 0 = 1; fac n | n > 0 = n * fac (n-1) } - THAT WORKED!!! :P
21:14:37 <_coder_> Now to understand it XD
21:14:51 * palomer brings out the champagne
21:15:14 <palomer> fac 0 = 1
21:15:21 <palomer> fac n = n * (fac (n-1))
21:15:26 <_coder_> Past midnight prolly not good to think right now XD
21:15:33 <palomer> I find that more elegant
21:15:41 <palomer> there's actually a whole page dedicated to the factorial function
21:15:51 <Pete_I> you're serious?
21:16:06 <monochrom> oh hahaha yeah
21:16:10 <palomer> http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
21:16:10 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer"
21:16:27 * palomer kicks lambdabot
21:16:28 <Pete_I> sounds like a joke
21:16:30 <monochrom> http://www.vex.net/~trebla/
21:16:31 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "Albert Y. C. Lai "
21:16:36 <monochrom> nice!
21:17:21 <palomer> fac n = product [1..n]
21:18:08 <palomer> how do you set the title of a page in html?
21:18:39 <palomer> man I'm busted
21:18:54 <monochrom> <html> <head><title>Albert Y. C. Lai </title>  ... other things ... </head> <body> ... </body> </html>
21:18:55 <AtnNn> title tag
21:20:35 <monochrom> "other things" refer to other things you want to put in the head section, such as stylesheet spec, how-often-to-refresh spec, what-encoding-I'm-using spec, ...
21:22:11 <palomer> hrmph
21:22:21 <monochrom> You are invited to take my html code as examples :)
21:22:24 <palomer> I was thinking of incorporating malicious code into the title
21:22:33 <palomer> but that won't work
21:22:34 <Lokadin> say how do i search google from the address bar?
21:22:36 <palomer> :(
21:22:53 <Lokadin> http://www.google.ca/q=hello
21:22:54 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "404 Not Found"
21:23:03 <Lokadin> http://www.google.ca/?q=hello
21:23:03 <palomer> BURN!
21:23:03 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "404 Not Found"
21:23:06 <aFlag> hi, what's a good way of thinking in monads? Is there some article, or something? I'm finding it hard
21:23:16 <monochrom> You can always attempt a looooong title and try a buffer-overrun :)
21:23:24 <palomer> nice!!
21:23:25 <LordBrain> try http://www.google.ca/search?q=hello
21:23:26 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "hello - Google Search"
21:24:23 <int-e> . o O ( The title of that page is "http://..." )
21:24:24 <lambdabot> You have specified an invalid URL
21:24:24 <Lokadin> thanks :)
21:24:43 <int-e> but, lambdabot doesn't see its own messages.
21:24:57 <aFlag> hehe lambdabot is always trying to be helpful
21:25:12 <palomer> http://www.magnesium.net/~palomer/blah.html
21:25:14 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks vim sucks

21:25:25 <LordBrain> Hey, i like vim
21:25:26 <aFlag> now he's just flooding
21:25:34 <palomer> just testing
21:25:59 <Lokadin> hmmm that's odd it tells me permission denied
21:26:21 <palomer> not me
21:26:47 <palomer> it can detect vim users and it usually denies them access to the awesome knowledge that lies therein
21:27:05 <palomer> int-e: at all?
21:27:25 <palomer> we should get two lambdabots in here
21:27:30 <palomer> and have them have a go at each other
21:27:32 <int-e> no we should not.
21:27:36 <palomer> what kind of code would throw them in an infinite loop?
21:27:46 <palomer> this is a very tough question
21:27:48 <_coder_> What is the standard file format for haskell files?
21:27:51 <_coder_> .h?
21:27:57 <palomer> .hs
21:28:02 <_coder_> ah, ta
21:28:04 <palomer> np
21:28:15 <_coder_> :]
21:28:56 * Lemmih points out that the extention is in no direct way related to the format of the file.
21:29:20 <_coder_> I know
21:29:30 <_coder_> I didn't know what to call it, I'm tired right now XD
21:29:38 * palomer points out that Lemmih is being too much of a pedant
21:29:41 <_coder_> past midnight... brain is null
21:29:41 <Lokadin> bah, i can't wget -O- google pagess
21:30:04 <Lokadin> search queries anyways
21:30:31 <monochrom> filename extension
21:31:16 <bdash> two lambdabots, and mentioning a URL thats title contains another URL?
21:31:20 <monochrom> Or if you change "file" to "filename" that will be clear.
21:31:30 <palomer> bdash: no, you'd probably use @id or somesuch
21:31:47 <palomer> @id > 1+1
21:31:47 <lambdabot> > 1+1
21:32:16 <palomer> if there was another lambdabot here, it would have responded
21:32:20 <int-e> The title of that page is ".:[ packet storm ]:. - http://packetstormsecurity.org/"
21:32:20 <lambdabot> You have specified an invalid URL
21:32:39 <monochrom> The " at the end kills the cat.
21:33:38 <int-e> [http://food.oregonstate.edu/]
21:33:38 <lambdabot> You have specified an invalid URL
21:33:50 <stepcut> The title of that page is ".:[ packet storm ]:. -http://packetstormsecurity.org/ "
21:33:53 <lambdabot> The title of that page is ".:[ packet storm ]:. - http://packetstormsecurity.org/"
21:33:54 <monochrom> A long time ago someone brought another bot and caused, shall we say, a lively dialogue between the two bots.  It has been tried.
21:33:56 <int-e> http://www.scenemusic.net/
21:34:00 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "Nectarine Radio Station- http://www.scenemusic.net - Your Demoscene Radio"
21:34:06 <int-e> The title of that page is "Nectarine Radio Station- http://www.scenemusic.net - Your Demoscene Radio"
21:34:10 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "Nectarine Radio Station- http://www.scenemusic.net - Your Demoscene Radio"
21:34:15 <int-e> so that one would work.
21:34:28 <palomer> ah yes, very nice
21:34:33 <int-e> @google intitle:http
21:34:35 <lambdabot> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/
21:34:41 <SamB_XP> so, what are you waiting for?
21:34:41 <palomer> ok, now someone get another lambdabot in here
21:34:44 <int-e> @google intitle:http://
21:34:45 <lambdabot> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/
21:34:47 <SamB_XP> where is your other lambdabot
21:34:57 <palomer> yeah, where's your other lambdabot?
21:35:25 <int-e> look I don't feel like causing a flood. pointing out how it could possibly be done is bad enough.
21:35:51 <SamB_XP> aww, no fun you are!
21:35:59 <palomer> :(
21:36:07 <monochrom> We are mathematicians.  The fun is in knowing it exists.
21:36:35 <SamB_XP> does lambdabot have flood control?
21:37:13 <palomer> we should test it out!
21:37:14 <int-e> it limits its output to one message per 2 seconds I believe.
21:37:17 <palomer> let's do it for science
21:37:34 <monochrom> Yes, it has flood control (see the "n more lines")
21:37:47 <int-e> (just let it list its command in a private chat and you'll see)
21:38:19 <SamB_XP> monochrom: that isn't flood control
21:38:34 <SamB_XP> that is ... spam control
21:38:57 <monochrom> I see.
21:39:02 <palomer> sci-ence! sci-ence!
21:39:18 <SamB_XP> we must test the math!
21:39:40 * palomer high fives SamB_XP 
21:40:17 <SamB_XP> I mean, if math doesn't need testing, then what is the point of QuickCheck?
21:40:35 <palomer> _exactly_
21:40:42 <palomer> you can't argue with that kind of logic
21:41:38 <int-e> argh
21:41:40 <int-e> [06:41:10] <lambdabot> [5558 @more lines]
21:42:02 <palomer> how did you do that?
21:42:28 <int-e> @more
21:42:45 <SamB_XP> it should do private chats via CTCP
21:42:57 <int-e> hmm. I guess any unlambda program with unbounded output will do.
21:43:20 <int-e> but ctcp will not work for many people.
21:43:39 <int-e> wait
21:43:53 <int-e> did you mean dcc? ctcp works of course.
21:45:20 <Lokadin> do i have to close the file after doing readFile?
21:45:28 <monochrom> Math doesn't need testing.  Programs don't need testing either.  I do not understand why testing is such a big business.  But don't tell me "if lots of people do it, there must be a reason".  People do lots of other stupid things too.
21:46:21 <Lokadin> are you making a joke?
21:46:27 <palomer> showdown!
21:46:30 <monochrom> Yes :)
21:46:35 <SamB_XP> monochrom: next time you get a segfault, remember: programs don't need testing!
21:46:37 <Lokadin> :)
21:46:39 <palomer> Lokadin: what is your rebuttal?
21:48:18 <Lokadin> do i need readFile to close after
21:48:28 <Lokadin> :p
21:48:34 <Lokadin> is my rebuttal
21:49:06 <monochrom> No.
21:49:12 <monochrom> is my rebuttal
21:49:31 <palomer> no, you
21:49:44 <palomer> ok guys, enough haskell
21:49:48 <monochrom> Anyway. readFile doesn't need close.
21:49:59 <palomer> I'm considering becoming less insecure
21:50:03 <palomer> what are your thoughts on this?
21:50:08 <monochrom> eh, enough Haskell?  what do you propose then?
21:50:14 <SamB_XP> because hGetContents already closes at EOF
21:50:27 <monochrom> Yeah, consider becoming more secure.
21:50:31 <SamB_XP> being less insecure is always good!
21:50:35 <palomer> but it isn't
21:50:39 <SamB_XP> except if it gets you killed or something
21:50:39 <palomer> I'm already 80% there
21:50:47 <palomer> it means I won't be human anymore
21:51:06 <palomer> I'm considering stopping this process
21:52:19 <monochrom> If you become more secure, you won't be human anymore?
21:52:26 <palomer> exactly
21:52:31 <palomer> what makes us human is our insecurity
21:52:57 <palomer> if I become completely secure I won't feel what hollywood calls "love"
21:53:00 <SamB_XP> I thought it was our stupidity
21:53:04 <SamB_XP> and sense of humor
21:53:51 <palomer> no no, you can find that in primates too
21:54:07 <Lokadin> brb
21:54:21 <SamB_XP> aren't some primates also insecure?
21:55:05 <palomer> well, they're more humans that the other primates
21:55:05 <LordBrain> hmmmm
21:55:23 <palomer> hollywood love flicks describe insecurity more than affection
21:55:30 <palomer> who's with me?
21:56:00 <monochrom> I offer this argument.  Some people think greed is human nature and therefore to remain human one must be somewhat greedy.  I say that's flawed.  Greed is ambition applied wrong; it is right to be ambitious for the right things/reasons; it is wrong to be be greedy.  To remain human you should be somewhat ambitious certainly, but you don't need greed.  So you may think about whether insecurity is actually another attribute app
21:56:00 <monochrom> lied wrong, and whether you should strive for the true attribute instead.
21:56:41 <palomer> which attribute would that be?
22:05:15 <monochrom> I think it's some kind of doubt.
22:05:48 <stepcut> monochrom: I have heard it said that greed is wanting something for nothing, whereas ambition is wanting alot in return for alot
22:05:51 <palomer> are you suggesting I strive towards self-doubt ?
22:05:59 <stepcut> or something to that effect
22:07:51 <monochrom> I think I should weaken "strive".  It is alright to have reasonable doubt.  (If you have so much certainty that everything is beyond doubt, then you vacuously have reasonable doubt, so that's still alright.)
22:08:14 <Lokadin> aoeu
22:08:15 <Lokadin> distmud: /home/loki/.distmud/map.hsdb: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)
22:08:24 <Cale> actually, to remain human all you have to do is maintain homeostasis by breathing and eating
22:08:33 <monochrom> haha
22:08:49 <SamB_XP> Cale: that is only homo sapien, not human
22:09:08 <Lokadin> @hoogle FilePath -> IO String
22:09:09 <lambdabot> Prelude.readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
22:09:13 <Lokadin> @hoogle FilePath -> String
22:09:13 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
22:09:30 <Lokadin> @hoogle writefile
22:09:31 <lambdabot> Prelude.writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
22:09:31 <lambdabot> System.Win32.File.c_WriteFile :: HANDLE -> Ptr a -> DWORD -> Ptr DWORD -> LPOVERLAPPED -> IO Bool
22:09:31 <lambdabot> System.Win32.File.win32_WriteFile :: HANDLE -> Ptr a -> DWORD -> Maybe LPOVERLAPPED -> IO DWORD
22:09:32 <stepcut> Cale: what if you transfer your (living) brain to a vat ? Are you still human?
22:09:52 <dons> re.
22:09:54 <Cale> probably not for long :)
22:10:32 <Cale> Even if I survived, I'd be a human brain, assuming that the rest of my body dies.
22:11:46 <monochrom> If I remove a cell from myself, I'm still a human.  By induction, ... (duck)
22:12:05 <Lokadin> say, sa i'm confused as to why resource is busy
22:12:07 <Lokadin> er locked
22:12:11 <SamB_XP> you'd be one of those monks who built the monastery where Jabba set up his palace!
22:12:22 <Lokadin> it can only be so locked by the currently running haskell program right?
22:14:45 <Lokadin> doesn't greed come from scarcity?
22:15:50 <lisppaste2> sethk pasted "Client Server class question" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/21203
22:15:53 <lambdabot> The title of that page is "Paste number 21203: Client Server class question"
22:16:21 <sethk> All, I've pasted some code with a question for whomever might feel like helping me to improve some code.
22:16:37 <sethk> Sorry about the wordiness; I try to make things short but it somehow never quite happens.
22:16:46 <SamB_XP> who is this "all" person people keep talking to?
22:17:11 <sethk> SamB_XP, must be the same person y'all from down south
22:17:23 <sethk> SamB_XP, or perhaps that guy "youse" from New York
22:18:06 <sethk> SamB_XP, more correctly, "youse guys"
22:21:08 <monochrom> If you find the "any" key, you will know the "all" person :)
22:23:02 <SamB_XP> earlier, someone addressed "some" and someone else addressed "none"
22:23:35 <Lokadin> wouldn't have these issues with lojban
22:26:00 <Lokadin> so how can a file be locked?
22:28:40 <Lokadin> er what was that command that showed what files were in use?
22:29:04 <SamB_XP> lsof or fuser?
22:29:57 <Lokadin> lsof thanks :)
22:30:20 <SamB_XP> fuser might be more appropriate in this instance
22:31:04 <Lokadin> it's being used
22:31:07 <Lokadin> :S
22:31:11 <Lokadin> dono why though
22:31:27 <SamB_XP> fuser tells you what is using it, thats what it does ;-)
22:32:11 <Lokadin> loadMap :: FilePath -> IO Map
22:32:12 <Lokadin> loadMap filename = do raw <- readFile filename return (read raw)
22:32:41 <Lokadin> er that's the only call to it
22:32:50 <Lokadin> does it allow for it to exit the file/
22:33:46 <SamB_XP> you'd need to make sure that the entirety of "raw" was consumed
22:34:14 <SamB_XP> if "raw" isn't totally consumed, the file will still be open
22:34:42 <Lokadin> hmmm, how can i make sure of that/
22:35:09 <Lokadin> i'd think it would already be used
22:35:23 <SamB_XP> well... read is lazy.
22:35:41 <Lokadin> can i force it to be strict?
22:36:11 <Lokadin> or cut off the rest of raw
22:36:36 <SamB_XP> > take 2 (read ("[10,24," ++ error "Ouch!")) :: [Int]
22:36:37 <lambdabot>  Exception: Ouch!
22:36:47 <SamB_XP> > take 1 (read ("[10,24," ++ error "Ouch!")) :: [Int]
22:36:48 <lambdabot>  Exception: Ouch!
22:37:07 <SamB_XP> well, okay, so maybe read isn't actually lazy.
22:37:22 <Lokadin> alright :|
22:37:35 <SamB_XP> but it won't even be entered if you don't use the return value for something.
22:38:04 <Lokadin> hmmm
22:38:29 <SamB_XP> so you could maybe stick in a $! after the return?
22:38:29 <Lokadin> loadMap :: FilePath -> IO Map
22:38:29 <Lokadin> loadMap filename = do raw <- readFile filename return (read raw)
22:38:32 <Lokadin> er
22:38:35 <SamB_XP> and before the (read raw)
22:39:07 <Lokadin> alright i'll try that
22:39:39 <Lokadin> didn't help
22:39:43 <Lokadin> :(
22:39:54 <SamB_XP> oh well.
22:40:06 <Lokadin> oh
22:40:08 <Lokadin> i got it!!!
22:40:10 <Lokadin> :)
22:40:16 <SamB_XP> what?
22:40:27 <Lokadin> i have to actually use it
22:40:31 <Lokadin> like you said
22:40:40 <Lokadin> i have a show, so it prints to screen the Map
22:40:50 <Lokadin> and if i do that then it doesn't complain
22:41:04 <int-e> @type readFile
22:41:05 <lambdabot> FilePath -> IO String
22:41:28 <Lokadin> is thtere any way of forcing it to use Map?
22:41:57 <SamB_XP> huh?
22:42:20 <SamB_XP> aren't you already?
22:42:23 <int-e> the type signature should do that. but you're missing a semicolon or newline ... loadMap filename = do raw <- readFile filename; return (read raw)
22:42:39 <Lokadin> basically, if i do, show :q, no problem, but if it's just :q, and i never call on the map, i get an error
22:42:47 <sethk> if anyone has any ideas, I'm loggint this channel, or email me at seth@cql.com
22:43:54 * SamB_XP goes beddy-by
22:44:08 <Lokadin> SamB_XP: :( co'o
22:52:13 <Lokadin> hmmm
22:52:42 <Lokadin> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
22:55:35 <Lokadin> say, are there any alternatives to the file-directory organization of data?
22:56:52 <Korollary> databases?
22:57:58 <Lokadin> other than simple tables to
22:59:30 <Lokadin> i guess there are tags
23:00:35 <Lokadin> only problem i have with the directory/file type of organization is that your start location is always the same
23:01:50 <Lokadin> i guess it's not too bad when you take into account things like links
23:04:24 <kosmikus> good morning
23:07:05 <Lokadin> coi kosmikus 
23:08:48 <Lokadin> bah i'm so tired, i just realized that i should be making my mud in a completly different manner
23:09:56 <dfeuer> Use less sand.
23:10:06 <Lokadin> lol
23:10:17 <dfeuer> Almost everyone uses too much sand the first time.
23:10:35 <Lokadin> :p
23:11:18 <dfeuer> Lokadin, there are all sorts of databases for storing information.
23:11:35 <Lokadin> yea, but i decided there is no point
23:11:44 <Lokadin> i'll just use the filesyste
23:11:45 <Lokadin> m
23:12:00 <dfeuer> What's yer purpose?
23:12:10 <Lokadin> to make a p2p Mud
23:12:14 <Lokadin> and
23:12:23 <Lokadin> er eventually a uniform interface
23:12:40 <lispy> a filesystem is a database :)
23:13:17 <Lokadin> your brain is a database :P
23:13:23 <Lokadin> :)
23:14:07 <lispy> your mom! is a databese ;)
23:14:12 <Lokadin> lol
23:15:23 <Lokadin> bah, i'll go do some vaporizer see if i feel up to a rewrite now
23:15:26 <Lokadin> brb
23:21:13 <Lokadin> hmmm
23:22:07 <dfeuer> Lokadin, making a MUD is not the reason you want a database.
23:22:28 <dfeuer> You want the database to serve some purpose in the MUD.
23:22:34 <dfeuer> The question is: what purpose?
23:25:58 <Lokadin> to store the map
23:26:15 <Lokadin> :) i've decided on doing the rewrite :)
23:26:21 <Lokadin> .ui lol
23:27:05 <Lokadin> if you want i can tell you what i'm planning for the mud, though if you have anything better to do be my guest :)
23:32:41 <Lokadin> i'll go continue with the rewrite bbl
