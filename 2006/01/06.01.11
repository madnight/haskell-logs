00:18:48 * palomer has decided never to open evolution again!
00:18:50 <palomer> go gmail!
00:23:56 * gour recently moved to evolution
00:24:14 <palomer> it gets slow when you have 10 000 emails in your trash
00:24:20 <palomer> and there's no way to remove them from your trash
00:24:30 <palomer> furthermore, it's sometimes hard to find the mail that you get
00:24:49 <palomer> since new conversations are sorted by earliest email in that conversation
00:25:31 <gour> palomer: what type of accounts you use?
00:25:58 <palomer> eh?
00:26:00 <palomer> pop, smtp
00:26:41 * gour now uses (mostly) imap
00:26:43 <palomer> and something else that sucks about evolution
00:26:48 <palomer> importing mailboxes is a pain
00:27:08 <palomer> so is exporting
00:27:20 <gour> i do not get how you cannot remove msg from the trash --> Expunge ?
00:28:15 <gour> otoh, you can define your own views, ie. Sort as you like (ascending, desc. ..)
00:28:36 <palomer> expunge?
00:28:38 <palomer> don't have that button
00:28:56 <gour> i moved all my email from maildir to evo and you can export to mbox and then work further...
00:29:03 <gour> which evo?
00:29:12 <palomer> 2.2.2
00:29:31 <gour> hmm, i'm on 2.4.2, Folder -> Expunge (Ctrl-E) 
00:29:47 <gour> or File -> Empty trash
00:29:55 <jargon> the feds have already tried to kill me twice :/
00:30:10 <jargon> one time they made it green both directions
00:30:45 <jargon> another time they sent an assissin in to cause an accident using car car then sped off
00:30:59 <palomer> Ctrl-E works
00:31:23 <gour> palomer: great :-)
00:31:27 <palomer> but it makes my evolution 10x slower
00:32:11 <jargon> another time that same asssassin tryied to bump me into oncoming traffic
00:33:36 <gour> palomer: 2.4.2 has option Edit -> Preferences -> Mail Preferences how often you want to expunge your mailboxes
00:34:04 * gour is new with evo so does not know about 2.2.2)
00:35:19 <jargon> zodiac is a project by the nsa to weed out undesirable us citizens
00:36:14 <ulfdoz> can someone point me to an explanation for combinator parsing? The principle is clear, but I do not see, why it works as suggested by Simon Thompson in "Haskell"?
01:12:10 <dcoutts> SamB_XP, because xerox is the only one who ever gives me more karma :-) and only when I add cool new features to Gtk2Hs. I've got to work hard for my karma! :-)
01:16:48 <mardy> Elo! sitting messing about in wxhaskell and have come across the problem of wanting to replace a panel with another one, now to my question: I can do this with visibility but it feels like a hacky solution, it there some other way of doing this?
01:17:23 <mardy> and is there any way of destroying a widget?

01:29:48 <yozora> ahh thanks
01:30:27 <yozora> what happened to that controversy over monad fail?
01:31:17 <Heffalump> well, the language isn't going to change in a hurry
01:31:46 <saintiss> hi
01:31:54 <yozora> hiya
01:31:56 <saintiss> in (x:xs), why is x always just one character?
01:32:05 <saintiss> s/character/element
01:32:11 <saintiss> and s the remainder?
01:32:28 <saintiss> does it depend on 'x', or is it just convention?
01:32:34 <yozora> it's convention
01:32:39 <yozora> you can call it what you like
01:32:44 <saintiss> i.e. if I do (s:sx), then s is one element?
01:32:49 <Heffalump> the name is convention
01:32:57 <Heffalump> the fact that it's only one element is because that's what (:) does
01:33:22 <saintiss> ah, ok... so what do I do if I want everything but the *last* element?
01:33:29 <Heffalump> write a recursiive function
01:33:40 <Heffalump> or do reverse . tail . reverse
01:34:02 <saintiss> right... ok thanks
01:34:22 <Heffalump> think of it like a linked list in C (if you know C)
01:34:23 <saintiss> just starting to look into haskell here :)
01:34:35 <Heffalump> (a singly linked list, that is)
01:34:37 <saintiss> yeah...
01:34:47 <Heffalump> it's easy to chop off the first element, but you have to walk the entire list to chop off the last one
01:35:02 <saintiss> hmm, indeed
01:37:43 <yozora> > (reverse.tail.reverse) [1..10]

01:38:56 <Cale> > last [1..10]
01:38:59 <lambdabot> 10
01:39:16 <Heffalump> oh, so it is
01:39:22 <saintiss> hmm, ic :)
01:39:23 <Heffalump> I keep thinking it isn't, for some reason. Sorry.
01:59:34 <yozora> does anyone understand what an "orphan instances" warning means when I load something in ghci?
02:02:10 <yozora> it seems that Rational and Float don't have a TH Lift instance, but
02:02:55 <yozora> when i declare my own, and load it, ghci warns me of orphan instances where
02:03:09 <yozora> instance Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Lift GHC.Float.Float = $fLiftFloat
02:03:48 <ADEpt> yozora: it means that you have not used those instances yet, IMO
02:04:13 <yozora> what's the $fLiftFloat stuff?
02:04:36 <yozora> if it's just saying my instances are orphans, then i get it, but i'm just worried that i'm shadowing
02:04:45 <yozora> some predefined instance declaration
02:05:40 <yozora> given that i can quasi-quote any expression but only Lift lift instances
02:17:39 <joelk> I want to work on lambdabot. What are the policies for connecting to freenode? Do I need to do anything first?
02:24:08 <ADEpt> yozora: you'll get error if you are redefining instan of the typeclass
02:25:27 <yozora> right, so it's okay what I'm doing, it's just telling me that
02:25:53 <yozora> my instance declaration is in a module separate from the class and type
02:26:19 <yozora> just with a weird message
02:31:21 <gour> dcoutts: ping
02:31:26 <dcoutts> gour, pong
02:32:01 <gour> dcoutts: we're on wp-2. pls. check if everything is ok
02:32:07 <dcoutts> oh, cool
02:32:25 <gour> dcoutts: i merged wp-2 with the present version 1st and then uploaded merged version
02:32:35 <dcoutts> ok
02:32:53 * gour thinks wp-devs could make upgrade smoother, i.e. when user customize his/her theme etc.
02:34:06 <gour> dcoutts: afaik, wp-2 makes more sense with users & its roles...
02:34:13 <dcoutts> yeah
02:34:27 <dcoutts> looks good so far, I've not found anything wrong in the upgrade
02:34:31 <dcoutts> well done
02:34:44 <dcoutts> our old plugins are still working
02:35:21 <dcoutts> the rss still works
02:37:44 <Itkovian> iirc there was somebody who started collecting solutions to the Craft of FP book by S. Thompson ... any pointers?
02:38:05 <gour> Itkovian: i'm interested too
02:38:47 <Itkovian> well, I'm preparing some exercises for a lesson due somewhere in March ... and I'd like to compare alternative solutions
02:42:12 <dcoutts> gour, oh you fixed the file perm problem I see. I was having trobule logging out since one php file was unreadable I think.
02:44:24 <gour> dcoutts: yep, i put dirs-775 and files 664, is it ok?
02:44:36 <dcoutts> seems ok no
02:44:39 <dcoutts> no/now
02:46:42 <gour> dcoutts: docs says that if we want to use Database Backup plugin, we'd need to put wp-content as 666 or even 777
02:46:49 <gour> dcoutts: i don't like this idea
02:47:08 <dcoutts> gour, we've already got database backup going
02:47:22 <gour> dcoutts: maybe we can disable it
02:47:30 <dcoutts> which?
02:47:31 <gour> dcoutts: really? some cron?
02:47:36 <dcoutts> yeah
02:47:39 <dcoutts> cron
02:47:48 <dcoutts> I've got daily db backups
02:47:57 <gour> ok, then you can disable that plugin (if you're logedd)
02:50:37 * gour disabled backup plugin

04:56:40 <jemfinch> I saw a good paper on Generic Haskell the other day, it talked about the "shape" of types, iirc...does that ring a bell with anyone?
05:02:14 <kosmikus> jemfinch: which paper?
05:05:40 <jemfinch> kosmikus: that's what I'm trying to find out :)
05:05:45 <jemfinch> I didn't save it, I just read it online.
05:06:44 <kosmikus> was it about generic haskell only, or about something else using generic haskell?
05:07:13 <jemfinch> actually, come to think of it, it was a presentation.
05:08:18 <jemfinch> it basically modelled a basic hindley-milner typesystem (tuples, sum types, etc.) in a way that seemed curiously like a hindley-milner typesystem :)
05:08:24 <jemfinch> I'll search LtU.
05:09:21 <kosmikus> there are many papers on Generic Haskell, and I'm afraid that "shape" is used in more than one
05:09:59 <kosmikus> I think the word goes back to Barry Jay
05:10:43 <jemfinch> aha
05:10:43 <jemfinch> http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/talks/UO2.pdf
05:10:46 <jemfinch> that's what I wanted.
05:11:53 <kosmikus> yes, that one is very recent
05:12:42 <jemfinch> do you know any like it?
05:12:51 <kosmikus> http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~loeh/Koke2005.pdf
05:12:54 <kosmikus> is another one

05:40:24 <joelk> pretty cool, huh?
05:40:41 <jemfinch> there are pi billion seconds in a century :)
05:41:37 <joelk> it still doesn't handle the <sup> tags used for scientific notation, but tha shouldn't be too hard to add later.

05:47:40 <joelk> just need to make it do some substitutions to make that 1.0 x 10^-18
05:48:16 <Saulzar> @google megaseconds in 1e-20 picoseconds

05:49:10 <Saulzar> Hm, I was wondering if they cheated and just put a threshold on it to stop the silly conversions

05:54:30 <Saulzar> There you go, weight of Jupiter in grains
05:55:23 <joelk> anyone know where to change the character lambdabot responds to? so joelk_bot could use eg :google
05:55:42 <sieni> shouldn't that be in some redneck unit like "football field", "library of congress" or "the length of NY-LA roundtrip"
05:59:18 <joelk> how about:
05:59:19 <joelk> @google 1 deciliter in bushels

06:00:24 <lambdabot> No result found.
06:00:28 <Itkovian> does and :: [Bool] -> Bool shortcircuit?
06:00:35 * Saulzar suspects google units gets more queries about troy ounces and US bushels than kilograms or meters :)
06:00:45 <earthy> so, a bushel is less than a 'fust'
06:00:47 <Heffalump> Itkovian: yes
06:01:24 <Itkovian> Heffalump: thx
06:01:46 <Itkovian> I expect it isn't implemented as a fold then
06:01:59 <Itkovian> or does fold allow you to shortcircuit too? I thought not
06:03:45 * Itkovian tests
06:05:00 <Heffalump> foldr does
06:05:06 <Heffalump> if your operator does
06:05:09 <Itkovian> yes, i just realised that
06:05:11 <Heffalump> remember lazy evaluation
06:07:22 <kzm> @google 300000000 m/s in furlongs/fortnight

06:09:01 <joelk> ok, I really have to clean that up...
06:13:16 <kzm> :-)
06:13:36 <kzm> Is there a standard way to combine multiple folds?
06:15:56 <Heffalump> in what way?
06:16:10 <kzm> I.e. I have a lazy list, and a set of functions that can be foldl/red.  Is there a "best practice" in order to combine them, so that the list is only traversed once?  Something like: mfoldl :: [(a->b->a)] -> [a] -> [b] -> [a]
06:16:31 <kzm> ...hmm, except that the function may return different types.  So, a tuple, then.
06:16:45 <sieni> microcentury and picolightyear are my personal favourites
06:17:03 <kzm> tfoldl (f1,f2,...fn) (z1,z2..zn) xs 
06:18:27 <edwinb> couldn't you compose the functions in some suitable way?
06:19:50 <kzm> perhaps: f x (z1,z2...zn) = (f1 x z1, f2 x z2... fn x zn) ?
06:20:10 <kzm> with some strictness added, of course.

06:23:56 <SamB> apparantly conjure works well as a leacher
06:25:39 <SamB> perhaps not exactly "well"
06:26:22 <SamB> it doesn't seem to use multiple peers well yet...
06:29:27 <Heffalump> kzm: yeah, a tuple
06:29:52 <SamB> only probably a strict tuple-ish thing is better, of course
06:30:49 <musasabi> dons: I think we should rather submit a Data.Array.UnsafeOp to fptools than doing these things by hand.
06:32:26 <musasabi> dons: just pretty 1) unsafeRead, 2) unsafeWrite, 3) swap, 4) comb (do x <- unsafeRead ...; y <- unsafeRead ...; unsafeWrite ... (op x y))
06:34:33 <nattfodd> hi, I'm looking for an image lib in haskell
06:34:43 <nattfodd> does anyone know if such a thing exists somewhere ?
06:34:55 <nattfodd> I found bindings for imlib2 but can't get them to link correctly
06:34:59 <edwinb> any Cabal/haddock experts about?
06:35:08 <Saulzar> SamB, Cool - sounds like you're making good progress. 
06:36:18 <Saulzar> What are your goals? I suppose uploading is useful...?
06:37:29 <musasabi> nattfodd: what kind of image library?
06:38:19 <SamB> it can upload too
06:38:56 <nattfodd> musasabi: something that can basically load a jpg/png and resize/scale/zoom/rotate it
06:39:06 <SamB> for some reason it is not downloading from all peers...
06:40:05 <SamB> nattfodd: I'd go with trying to get them to link personally
06:42:14 <musasabi> nattfodd: there is an old imagemagick binding, but I would just go with cairo (I think it can do that)
06:43:01 <SamB> musasabi: cairo?
06:43:12 <SamB> isn't that some other library's job?
06:43:45 <Saulzar> It's part of gtk2hs
06:43:50 <Saulzar> Well, the bindings are
06:44:19 * SamB goes to class
06:44:40 <nattfodd> musasabi: hum, I didn't think of that
06:44:46 <nattfodd> looks nice
06:44:53 <SamB> I'll probably be back in about 8 hours
06:46:02 <dcoutts> nattfodd, so yeah, you can use cairo, or I can bind the simple rotate/scale PixBuf functions in Gdk.
06:46:14 <dcoutts> cairo can load png files and then do affine transforms on them
06:46:24 <dcoutts> I'm not sure it can load jpeg
06:46:40 <dcoutts> oh, actually via a pixbuf I think it can
06:46:49 <dcoutts> since it can use a pixbuf as a pattern source
06:47:36 <dcoutts> so that still needs the gtk package out of gtk2hs and not just the cairo package
06:47:48 <nattfodd> dcoutts: actually it's great, because it's for internal use in gtk2hs
06:47:55 <nattfodd> well in a program that uses gtk2hs
06:48:00 <dcoutts> oh great
06:48:40 <dcoutts> nattfodd, what app is that, if you don't mind me asking?
06:49:04 * dcoutts is always interested in what people are building using gtk2hs
06:49:41 <nattfodd> dcoutts: an app to manipulate my photos
06:49:58 <nattfodd> using gtk2hs to display them and curses app to manipulate
06:50:31 <nattfodd> hoepfully, it will make calls to appropriate external programs and be able to deal with .nef raw photos
06:50:42 <nattfodd> but this is really a pretext to learn haskell ;)
06:54:33 <saintiss> hi all
06:54:44 <saintiss> what exactly does "Just" do?
06:54:49 <saintiss> is it the identity function?
06:54:54 <saintiss> > Just 1
06:54:55 <lambdabot> Just 1
06:55:07 <saintiss> hrmm...
06:55:11 <saintiss> > Just 1 == 1
06:55:12 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num (Maybe a))
06:55:41 <saintiss> ... :s
06:58:20 <xerox> saintiss: it constructs a value of the 'Maybe a' type, getting a value of the 'a' type.
06:58:25 <xerox> @type Just
06:58:26 <dcoutts> nattfodd, sounds fun
06:58:26 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> Maybe a
06:58:33 <xerox> Ohi dcoutts!
06:59:11 <xerox> saintiss: also, the type of (==) is (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool; that is, its two arguments must be of the same type.
07:01:32 <dcoutts> Oi! xerox
07:01:44 <tromp_> > () == 0
07:01:46 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num ())
07:01:58 <tromp_> see? same thing; incomparable types
07:02:42 <xerox> > () == undefined
07:02:43 <lambdabot> Undefined
07:02:50 <xerox> Foo.
07:03:14 <tromp_> @type (==) (Just 1)
07:03:16 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq (Maybe a), Num a) => Maybe a -> Bool
07:04:56 <xerox> 'Eq (Maybe a)' is unuseful, isn't it?
07:05:04 <xerox> (in that type)
07:05:32 <dcoutts> nattfodd, so there's setSourcePixbuf which works much like setSource (but for a Pixbuf rather than a cairo Pattern)
07:06:00 <dcoutts> nattfodd, though I think you have to set up the transformation before using that function
07:06:29 <dcoutts> it's a slightly round about way of going about transforming a bitmap
07:06:51 <nattfodd> dcoutts: I think it should be ok once I get how to use the cairo bindings
07:06:53 <dcoutts> the cairo pattern/source concept is much more general that you need for your app
07:07:11 <nattfodd> haskell just feels so weird for now :)
07:07:36 <dcoutts> cairo allows you to draw arbirtary shapes and use a bitmap as the source 'pen' for that
07:07:51 <dcoutts> and with an arbitrary 2D transformation
07:08:01 <nattfodd> I know cairo pretty well, the problem is haskell ;)
07:08:21 <dcoutts> it'd be simpler with just the gdk-pixbuf scale/crop functions
07:08:24 <dcoutts> nattfodd, ok :-)
07:08:46 <nattfodd> yet another haskell tutorial is the best resource for learning ?
07:09:20 <xerox> Howdy nattfodd :-)
07:09:37 <nattfodd> hey xerox :)
07:09:48 * dcoutts is not qualified to answer nattfodd's question
07:10:30 <xerox> dcoutts: do you really think so?
07:10:35 <saintiss> xerox, ok thanks
07:10:42 <xerox> nattfodd: it's a pretty good tutorial yes.
07:10:43 <joelk> ok, hmm.. joelk_bot is mostly working.
07:10:58 <xerox> joelk: hi!
07:11:19 <joelk> $google mass of uranus in carats
07:11:20 <joelk_bot> mass of Uranus = 4.34245 x 10^29 carats
07:11:33 <joelk> xerox, Hiya!
07:11:48 <xerox> joelk: ?!
07:12:17 <saintiss> nattfodd, if you want to learn haskell, I can recommend the ppt slides at
07:12:17 <saintiss> http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2005-August/010994.html
07:12:31 <saintiss> very good to get an impression
07:12:56 <xerox> @wiki HaskellIntro
07:12:57 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIntro
07:13:11 <xerox> A nice pace to skim and go back reading once a while :)
07:13:55 <nattfodd> ppt :s
07:14:05 <dcoutts> xerox, I'm not qualifed since I've never really read any of the Haskell tutorials
07:14:19 <xerox> dcoutts: ah, in that sense, but hey..  :)
07:15:41 <dcoutts> xerox, check out the latest svg-cairo bindings:
07:15:41 <dcoutts> http://darcs.haskell.org/gtk2hs/svgcairo/Graphics/Rendering/Cairo/SVG.chs
07:16:08 <dcoutts> xerox, I told you we're now using darcs for Gtk2Hs now?
07:16:19 <dcoutts> for the master repo, not just as a cvs mirror
07:16:42 <dcoutts> it's all darcs now! :-)
07:16:44 * joelk waves goodbye
07:18:37 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: ping
07:18:49 <JaffaCake> hi CosmicRay
07:19:03 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: hi.  I got your email about darcs.
07:19:17 <JaffaCake> cool, sorry about changing our minds :(
07:19:31 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I would be willing to take the darcsified libraries repos we have now and split them up into individual repos by branching each one off the current history as appropriate
07:19:51 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: realistically though, I don't think I'll have time to re-tailor each one, especially if we care about the ghc-6.4 branch
07:20:15 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: however I'd be happy to share what I know about how to do it
07:20:26 <JaffaCake> is it realistic for me to do it?  how long does it take?
07:20:28 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: or I could probably re-tailor them without the ghc-6.4 branch
07:20:57 <JaffaCake> maybe without the 6.4 branch would be the way to go, I'm still using CVS for 6.4 anyway
07:21:04 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: it doesn't take that much human time to do just a basic conversion.  you set it up and then it churns for awhile.
07:21:38 <JaffaCake> if you'd be happy to do it without the 6.4 branch, then I think we should go with that
07:21:42 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: ok.  tailorizing the branches is what really takes a lot of time.
07:21:46 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: yes, I'd have time to do that.
07:22:14 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: let me make sure I understand what you want correctly...  every top-level directory in the current libraries repo should be its own darcs repo?
07:22:27 <JaffaCake> right
07:22:36 <CosmicRay> and whatever "libraries" repo we have should consist of just the top-level files, plus a few scripts to automate getting/pushing/etc with the others?
07:22:38 * JaffaCake takes a look to make sure
07:22:55 <CosmicRay> and any-other top-level directory that I see in $CVSROOT libraries should be ignored?
07:23:28 <JaffaCake> I think we should forget about the libraries repo after we do this
07:23:46 <JaffaCake> it'll only have a few files, I'll just add them to the ghc repo by hand
07:24:00 <CosmicRay> ok.  
07:24:15 <CosmicRay> you will probably want to have some scripts, somewhere, to automate checkouts of all this.
07:24:28 <JaffaCake> yes
07:24:44 <JaffaCake> I've been getting away without scripts so far, but this will require them I think
07:24:57 <CosmicRay> yes, there are too many here to be practical by hand.
07:26:38 * JaffaCake wonders what to do about Cabal
07:26:40 <CosmicRay> ok, was I correct that we move over the exact set of top-level directories that exist in libraries/ currently?
07:26:53 <CosmicRay> oh, it has its own separate darcs repo, doesn't it?
07:27:03 <CosmicRay> indeed it does.
07:27:09 <JaffaCake> yes, but it's not quite the same - we have different Makefiles I think
07:27:47 <JaffaCake> I don't want to have to change our build system to use Cabal just yet
07:28:42 <JaffaCake> btw, omit the doc directory
07:28:58 <JaffaCake> and mk
07:29:44 <JaffaCake> and I think we should put these  darcs repos under a subdir on darcs.haskell.org, perhaps packages/
07:29:52 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: in any case, we should start with the existing Cabal repo, and you should apply your patches against a branch of it
07:30:00 <CosmicRay> was just going to ask that.
07:30:02 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: quite right
07:30:16 <JaffaCake> so forget about Cabal for now
07:30:55 <CosmicRay> ok, so I will convert every top-level directory in the current libraries repo (except doc, mk, and Cabal), put the result in directories under packages, and convert HEAD only.  sound right?
07:31:45 <JaffaCake> sounds good, I'm just checking about HUnit, I think it has a darcs repo somewhere
07:32:24 <JaffaCake> nah, can't find it
07:32:29 <CosmicRay> ok.  your message to me read as if it was CC'd somewhere, but I didn't get any CC lines.  would you like me to reply to your message and CC anybody?
07:32:58 <JaffaCake> it was cross-posted to ghc.users
07:33:02 <CosmicRay> OK.
07:33:26 <JaffaCake> (hmm, that's an unfortunate side effect of using gmane to post to mailing lists)
07:33:39 <CosmicRay> depends on your newsreader
07:33:43 <JaffaCake> yes, please reply
07:33:53 <CosmicRay> ok.
07:33:58 <CosmicRay> will do.
07:34:33 <JaffaCake> thanks again, and sorry for not doing this right the first time
07:42:35 <CosmicRay> that's ok
07:43:29 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, I wanted to talk to you about how to set up emailing of all patches pushed to a repo
07:43:56 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, though in the end I figured something out, but if you've already got a good solution I'd be interested
07:43:59 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: sure.  the method I've tested so far is using darcs prefs to set an automatic cc attribute for all calls to darcs apply
07:44:10 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: when you do a darcs push, it winds up calling darcs apply on the remote end.
07:44:15 <dcoutts> yes
07:44:27 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: this gives approximately the same level of detail as the cvs commit notices that are sent now.
07:44:43 <dcoutts> I have it use a posthook to a script which emails, what do you do?
07:44:53 <dcoutts> sounds like you've got something simpler
07:45:05 <CosmicRay> yeah, no need to use a posthook, just set the CC address to be the mailing list.
07:45:18 * dcoutts has never seen that option
07:45:18 <nomeata> Hi. For some simulation, I am creating large lists of random number (10000 small integers), send it to some (pure functional) function and retain only on value. I want to repeat that experiment 100 times, but it seems it is keeping all the lists with random numbers in memory, even when they should be out of scope. what can I do there?
07:45:24 <CosmicRay>       --cc=EMAIL                     mail results to additional EMAIL(s). Requires --reply
07:45:29 <CosmicRay> that's from darcs apply --help
07:45:33 <dcoutts> ah ok
07:45:45 <dcoutts> so in the _darcs/prefs/defaults you say what?
07:46:21 <CosmicRay> I forget the exact format of the file at this instant, but something like "apply cc cvs@haskell.org\napply reply fromaddress@haskell.org"
07:46:31 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, thanks.
07:47:39 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, does that send an email per-patch or per-push ?
07:48:47 <nomeata> If I do "do randnum <- sequence (replicate 10000 genRandNum); return (simulate randnum)", is the list of 10000 genRandNum deleted when this code was executed? Or is this code totall bullshit (which is quite possible :-))
07:48:47 <CosmicRay> per push, I believe.
07:48:59 <dcoutts> ok, ta
07:54:13 <earthy> nomeata: the code looks like bullshit.
07:54:28 <earthy> what type is genRandNum?
07:54:37 <earthy> @type replicate
07:54:38 <lambdabot> forall a. Int -> a -> [a]
07:54:51 <earthy> @type sequence
07:54:53 <lambdabot> forall a (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => [m a] -> m [a]
07:55:12 <earthy> okay, nevermind
07:55:25 <ulfdoz> How can I generate an empty list of a concrete type in an expression like (\_ -> [])?
07:55:40 <earthy> ulfdoz: explicitly state the type
07:56:01 <nomeata> earthy: it's :: IO Integer 
07:56:03 <earthy> @type (\_ -> ([]::[Int]))
07:56:04 <lambdabot> forall t. t -> [Int]
07:56:15 <earthy> nomeate: I guessed that. :)
07:56:16 <nomeata> earthy: and returns a different number every time
07:56:32 <nomeata> earthy: who could I do it less bullshitty?
07:56:43 <earthy> it's not bullshit
07:56:51 <earthy> I was thinking with my brain off
07:57:09 <nomeata> oh, thanks. but it's still behaving like bullshit :)
07:57:18 <earthy> um?
07:57:31 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, kosmikus believes that the darcs apply --cc doesn't produce very nice results. So if you come to the same conclusion you can pinch the script that kosmikus and I hacked up.
07:57:33 <earthy> why? it needs to keep hold of the [m a].
07:57:40 <nomeata> if i repeat that code 100 times (which I need to do), it eats all my memory
07:57:45 <ulfdoz> wah, i made the mistake in the type signature of the calling function.
07:58:46 <earthy> nomeata: yes. the do you've written is in the list monad.
07:59:29 <nomeata> BTW, I repeat that code using this code "do qs <- sequence  ( replicate s ( <the code above> ) ; return ((sum qs) / (fromIntegral s))" (this should build the average of s runs of the above code)
07:59:30 <earthy> you may also think of it as [(simulate randnum) | randnum <- sequence (replicate 10000 genRandNum)]
07:59:56 <earthy> um. now I'm talking bullshit
08:01:25 <earthy> okay, to make it slightly less bulshitty: do randomNumbers <- sequence (replicate 10000 genRandNum); return (simulate randomNumbers)
08:01:34 <earthy> (that makes it harder to misread ;))
08:01:40 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: ok, that'll be nice.
08:01:52 <earthy> however, the return (simulate randomNumbers) *may* merely evaluate to a single number
08:02:04 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, for reference the script I've got makes emails that look like so:
08:02:04 <dcoutts> http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=14436343
08:02:09 <earthy> nomeata: do you know that simulate is strict?
08:02:20 <nomeata> earthy: what is strict? :-]
08:02:21 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, the patch name as subject line and one email per-patch
08:02:44 <earthy> then you might fix your problem with   do randomNumbers <- sequence (replicate 10000 genRandNum); return (simulate $! randomNumbers)
08:02:47 <nomeata> it's type is :: Fractional b => Integer -> [Integer] -> b
08:03:00 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, and the patches can be verbose (the whole patch) or just the summary of which files changed, like the current ghc-cvs list ones
08:03:55 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, something that'd be cool would be the summary style and a link to the darcs web interface to see the whole patch.
08:04:18 <earthy> nomeata: the issue is really that your return does not return a value into the IO monad
08:04:34 <earthy> it returns a thunk that may, upon evaluation, turn into a value
08:04:48 <earthy> however, that thunk has to hold on to the list of 10000 random numbers
08:04:50 <nomeata> earthy: ah, I see, the lazy evaluation is the problem
08:04:53 <earthy> bingo
08:05:02 <nomeata> earthy: so I have to force it to evaluate it, like sequence does
08:05:09 <earthy> that's it. ;)
08:05:21 <nomeata> (what I learned by running sequence on an infinite list of random numbers ;-])
08:05:31 <earthy> took some time, didn't it? :)
08:05:35 <nomeata> $! does not seem to help, though
08:06:16 <nomeata> then, how do I evaluate it? print?
08:08:58 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: where is this funky script of yours? ;-)
08:09:03 <CosmicRay> oh
08:09:10 <earthy> okay, I'm no expert on fixing space leaks, but fortunately Simon Marlow was kind enough to put up a Haskell Performance Resource on http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Performance_Resource
08:09:14 <CosmicRay> didn't scroll back far enough ;-)
08:09:27 <nomeata> hmm. doesn't return do exactly that, evaluate a value and put it in IO? 
08:09:36 <CosmicRay> err wait a minute, that link didn't show the script
08:10:23 <earthy> nomeata: no.
08:10:50 <earthy> only when the IO action is then actually performed is the value evaluated
08:10:56 <earthy> conceptually
08:11:02 <nomeata> ok
08:16:12 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, see darcs.haskell.org:~duncan/bin/commit-messages-split.sh
08:17:01 <dcoutts> and darcs.haskell.org:/home/darcs/gtk2hs/_darcs/prefs/defaults
08:21:21 <nomeata> earthy: thanks: reaturn $! (simulate numbers) did the job
08:31:06 <nomeata> is there a nice way to avoid all these fromIntegrals in for example: (fromIntegral (leerstaende start zufluesse)) / (fromIntegral n)
08:37:10 <dcoutts> nattfodd, btw it turns out that the Pixbuf scaling/cropping functions are alread bound. I just didn't realise it. :-)
08:37:11 <dcoutts> http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/current/Graphics-UI-Gtk-Gdk-Pixbuf.html#v%3ApixbufScaleSimple
08:38:03 <dcoutts> nattfodd, the only ones missing were pixbufFlip and pixbufRotateSimple, which are now bound in the latest darcs version of Gtk2Hs
09:13:32 <palomer> hold the press!
09:13:46 <basti_> what for?
09:18:57 <palomer> why not?
09:19:07 <basti_> ok
09:30:16 * Saulzar waves a copy of "The Press" menacingly at palomer
09:57:37 <Lemmih> Hi SyntaxNinja.
10:05:31 <SyntaxNinja> hiya Lemmih
10:29:35 <ulfdoz> I have a combinator parser returning a list of successfull parses. What's the way to get the right one according to longest match criteria?
10:34:45 <ulfdoz> is there a more elegant way than an explicit measure over the matched length
10:35:33 <Cale> if you keep track of the lengths as you parse, you can ensure that you already have that information when you need it
10:36:41 <ulfdoz> I'd need something like a state monad, right?
10:36:56 <Cale> well, yeah
10:37:14 <ulfdoz> Ok, that's the point I should continue reading. :)
10:37:44 <Cale> you'll need to alter your parsing monad in a moderately obvious way
10:38:00 <Cale> it just has to keep track of the lengths of strings
10:38:21 <Cale> you could also do it by using a different string type, if that's any hint
10:40:06 <nattfodd> dcoutts: thank you very much
10:43:16 <phpkid7> if i have (>5) as function input, how can i extract it to different variables, like: i=> and j=5?
10:44:22 <Cale> phpkid7: hm?
10:44:24 <Lemmih> You can't.
10:44:34 <phpkid7> i want to use foldr with (>5), but foldr needs those 2 separated?
10:44:35 <resiak> You can't pattern match against a lambda, I guess? :)
10:44:54 <Cale> You can't look at the implementation of a function, once constructed
10:45:20 <resiak> Didn't think so
10:45:22 <Cale> If you need to put together, and take apart functions, you'll need to represent their construction with a separate data type
10:46:23 * resiak can't see how (>5) could be used with foldr in a well-typed way
10:46:27 <Lemmih> phpkid7: You want to use 'foldr' like a filter?
10:48:19 <phpkid7> well yes, and i have a function defined: func :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a],Int)
10:49:16 <Cale> phpkid7: how is func defined?
10:49:31 <Cale> > filter (>5) [1..10]
10:49:32 <lambdabot> [6,7,8,9,10]
10:49:39 <Cale> > map (>5) [1..10]
10:49:41 <lambdabot> [False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True]
10:49:48 <phpkid7> filter (>5) [9,7,6,4,14,2,1]  ==>  ([9,7,6,14],3)
10:49:52 <Cale> > foldr ((:) . (>5)) [] [1..10]
10:49:53 <lambdabot> [False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True]
10:49:54 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: HaXml has a darcs repo upstream.
10:50:00 <musasabi> also foldr fails on infinite lists which is quite problematic.
10:50:03 <phpkid7> and im supposed to implement it with foldr
10:50:39 <musasabi> phpkid7: do you know how to implement map with foldr (for finite lists)?
10:50:40 <Cale> > span (>5) [9,7,6,4,14,2,1]
10:50:42 <lambdabot> ([9,7,6],[4,14,2,1])
10:51:07 <Cale> no

10:52:25 <lambdabot> Add a type signature
10:52:31 <resiak> Bah.
10:52:40 <musasabi> phpkid7: when you know how to do map, filter will be easy.
10:52:42 <resiak> And there I was trying to defeat the bot, and it defeated me.
10:52:59 <sproingie> haskell, making infinite loops fast since 1990
10:53:08 <Cale> phpkid7: you're looking for a way to do it directly with foldr?
10:53:14 <phpkid7> yes
10:53:29 <phpkid7> this is how far i am:
10:53:31 <phpkid7> countFilter p xs = foldr f b xs
10:53:31 <phpkid7>          where f ...
10:53:31 <phpkid7>                b ...
10:53:35 <Cale> phpkid7: first write it as a function with two cases
10:53:43 <Cale> f [] = ...
10:53:48 <Cale> f (x:xs) = ...
10:54:13 <Cale> this sort of recursive function can be translated into a foldr
10:54:52 <phpkid7> but the problem is still the same: how can i extract the (>5)
10:54:57 <Cale> you can't
10:55:01 <Cale> but you can apply it
10:55:12 <Cale> you shouldn't need to extract the details of its construction
10:55:47 <Cale> like, you're passed a function which tests to see if something goes in the first list or the second
10:56:03 <Cale> you shouldn't need to be able to tell that the function is (>5)
10:56:55 <phpkid7> ok, thanks, i'll try
10:58:04 <Cale> just think about what foldr does and you should be okay -- if you'd like, I have some pictures of the various folds
10:59:45 <Cale> my solution is 71 chars, including spaces :)
11:03:37 <Cale> phpkid7: have a look at http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/folds.png
12:55:28 <palomer> hrm
12:55:32 * palomer wonders where lennart has run off to
12:56:37 <palomer> hrm
12:56:40 <chucky> palomer: lennart recently moved from Sweden to the US
12:56:46 <palomer> oh, very cool
12:56:49 <palomer> which university?
12:56:59 <chucky> he works for Galois
12:57:01 <tic> whaaa
12:57:13 <palomer> ndm: you around?
12:57:34 <ndm> palomer: yes
12:57:46 <palomer> oh, nevermind
12:57:47 <palomer> found the link
12:57:56 <palomer> actually
12:58:03 <palomer> do you have any references on the W algorithm?
12:58:41 <ndm> nope
12:58:49 <ndm> i don't understand much about typing
12:59:02 <ndm> but i think its one from the original hindley milner papers
13:04:24 <palomer> yeah, it is
13:04:24 <palomer> grr
13:05:00 * palomer goes to implement type inference in sml
13:05:06 <palomer> and then I'll do it again in haskell
13:05:10 <palomer> and then I'll do it with olaf's method
13:05:11 <palomer> pfft
13:06:18 <monochrom> There is some opportunity of reuse.
13:08:28 <palomer> eh?
13:11:06 <palomer> grr, sml can't derive Ord
13:11:15 <palomer> sml is a pain to use sometimes
13:19:05 <palomer> but sometimes it's a joy!
13:27:53 <palomer> ugh, I take it back, it's a pain
13:27:58 <Cale> hehe
13:28:21 <basti_> lol
13:28:27 <monochrom> I hope you will have no problem dating.
13:30:24 <palomer> eh?
13:46:05 <monochrom> Dating someone involves both pain and joy.  I hope you will not eventually conclude "I take it back, it's a pain"
13:48:44 <palomer> I invariantly do
13:49:18 <monochrom> heh heh heh
13:49:49 * monochrom notes invariance ==> eventuality
13:52:18 * palomer wishes he could set the colour in gmail
13:54:32 <monochrom> You can just write <color=red>This is in red</color>.
13:55:10 <monochrom> If it is not rendered in red, your recipient and still mediate over the tags and imagine he/she's seeing red.
13:56:57 <newsham> i'm looking for a good example of using FFI to access C code.  any suggestions?
13:57:13 <xerox> newsham: c2hs documentation is nice
13:57:17 <newsham> (not like "call sin(x)" but more sophisticated like "call pcap_open_live and pcap_next")
13:58:22 <monochrom> How is that more sophisticated?
13:58:26 <newsham> xerox: thanks.
13:59:01 <newsham> monochrome: because it involves structured data elements, callbacks, and (in some more complex cases) allocated data
14:01:51 <jargon> b*(Floor[v/b^p]/b - Floor[Floor[v/b^p]/b])
14:02:00 <newsham> i guess gtk+ would be a good example

14:05:23 <monochrom> Me too.
14:10:10 <newsham> anyone know why I would get that error when running a cabal setup (using runhaskell)
14:10:19 <newsham> ghc-6.4.1
14:10:37 <Lemmih> You need a newer cabal.
14:10:54 <newsham> isnt 6.4.1 pretty new (doesnt it come with cabal?)
14:11:17 <Lemmih> It ships with an old cabal.
14:11:25 <newsham> ahh.. danke
14:15:41 <frobenius> Hi! I am trying to write a parser for lambda expressions.
14:15:44 <frobenius> Using Parsec
14:15:53 <xerox> Hi!
14:15:54 <xerox> Good one
14:15:59 <monochrom> You should steal the one from palomer.
14:16:23 <monochrom> What season is this?  Everyone is parsing lambda expressions.
14:16:44 <monochrom> Should I just post mine so everyone can hand it in?
14:16:56 <xerox> There's no hype about lambda expressions! *cough*
14:17:23 <frobenius> It is a bit tricky to get the abstractions to work since they are just e.g. "x x"
14:17:41 <monochrom> That's application, not abstraction.
14:17:50 <frobenius> argh, yes.
14:17:59 <frobenius> the applications.
14:18:09 <monochrom> It's tricky to tell the two apart.
14:18:22 <frobenius> ;-) maybe
14:18:39 <frobenius> so I have a parser fulltermP = appP <|> termP
14:18:56 <frobenius> and then I have defined termP as follows:
14:19:01 <frobenius> termP = (try varP) <|> (try lambdaP) <|> (parens fulltermP)
14:19:04 <newsham> ok, I did "make install" in the new cabal directory, and then I reran the Setup.hs script and I get the same error
14:19:18 <newsham> can someone help me?  how do I verify that cabal got installed over the existing version?
14:19:20 <frobenius> appP = do { 	t1 <- termP ; many1 (char ' '); t2 <- termP ;  return (App t1 t2) } <?> "application"
14:19:32 <frobenius> palomer has some code I can look at?
14:19:32 <jargon> is haskell related to pascal?
14:19:39 <frobenius> (no)
14:19:44 <newsham> jargon: they're both programming languages :)
14:19:50 <xerox> Yes they're bot prog<Interrupted by newsham>
14:20:17 <jargon> =)
14:20:29 <newsham> ghc-pkg list shows "Cabal-1.0"
14:20:46 <frobenius> this palomer is not around, huh?
14:20:50 <monochrom> You cannot handle "f x y"
14:21:18 <xerox> @get-palomer!
14:21:19 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
14:21:20 <frobenius> I must be!
14:21:25 <monochrom> Ah you can handle "f x y" but there is an infinite loop.
14:21:30 <frobenius> why should I not be able to parse such expressions?
14:21:57 <monochrom> Nevermind.  You cannot handle "f x y".  Show me your parse tree.
14:22:00 <frobenius> I assume: lambda binders extends all the way to the right (right assoc??) and the other way around for abstractions
14:22:10 <monochrom> Err show me the derivation chain.
14:22:22 <frobenius> How is Haskell parsing?
14:22:49 <frobenius> surely I can
14:22:54 <frobenius> using e.g. try
14:22:58 <palomer> actually
14:23:06 <palomer> I did write a parsec parser for lambda expressions
14:23:08 <palomer> with let too
14:23:17 <palomer> want it?
14:23:21 <frobenius> YES
14:23:25 <frobenius> :-)
14:23:29 <palomer> really, really want it?
14:23:33 <xerox> 'whoopee, assignments!'
14:23:41 <palomer> wait, is this for an assignment?
14:23:45 <frobenius> no assignments!
14:23:59 <xerox> 'whoopee, :-)'
14:24:23 <frobenius> have courses started yet?
14:24:25 <newsham> # ./Setup.hs configure
14:24:26 <newsham> *** Exception: Line 21: Unknown field 'hs-source-dirs'
14:24:47 <frobenius> no, I am writing an interpreter for a pure type system
14:24:50 <frobenius> (PTS)
14:25:07 <frobenius> and lambda expressions is a subset of what I need to parse
14:25:12 <palomer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/CRZ6bO87.html
14:25:27 <palomer> this  grammar can also parse integers and booleans
14:25:46 <frobenius> that was very nice!
14:26:25 <musasabi> newsham: update Cabal.
14:26:40 <dany2k> is there a way to shorten this one: 
14:26:42 <dany2k> map reverse $ map (drop 2) $ map reverse [[1..3] | x <- [1..3]]
14:26:54 <dany2k> > map reverse $ map (drop 2) $ map reverse [[1..3] | x <- [1..3]]
14:26:55 <lambdabot> [[1],[1],[1]]
14:27:06 <frobenius> should I give credits, palomer?
14:27:34 <xerox> palomer: if you generalize it to arbitrary monads you could support more appropriate error handling, maybe.
14:27:50 <frobenius> is lexing really needed?
14:27:55 <xerox> dany2k: map head
14:28:13 <palomer> xerox: oh yeah, this is a crappy parser:o
14:28:21 <palomer> frobenius: sure, why not
14:28:24 <xerox> > map head [[1..3] | _ <- [1..3]]
14:28:26 <lambdabot> [1,1,1]
14:28:41 <xerox> > map (return . head) [[1..3] | _ <- [1..3]] :: [[Int]]
14:28:43 <lambdabot> [[1],[1],[1]]
14:28:46 <newsham> <musasabi> newsham: update Cabal.
14:28:47 <xerox> If you _really_ want.
14:28:49 <newsham> # ghc-pkg list|grep -i cabal
14:28:49 <newsham>     Cabal-1.0
14:28:50 <frobenius> palomer, if one really need to break down to tokens (maybe there is some problem with the (a b) that requires lexing)
14:28:51 <newsham> just did
14:29:03 <frobenius> palomer, I am going to write subst functions too
14:29:12 <dany2k> xerox: cool, thx
14:29:15 <palomer> frobenius: breaking down to tokens is very desirable, trust me
14:29:17 <newsham> am I doing something wrong?   could it still be using the old cabal?
14:29:27 <xerox> dany2k: you're welcome.
14:29:28 <palomer> and it's faster
14:29:47 <frobenius> there are very few tokens in untyped lambda calculus
14:30:01 <musasabi> newsham: Cabal-1.0 is old.
14:30:31 <newsham> its the "latest stable version"
14:30:36 <newsham> I guess I should get the release candidate?
14:30:43 <palomer> frobenius: oh, I might have a parser just for lambda calculus
14:30:45 <palomer> one sec
14:30:54 <newsham> installing 1.1.3
14:30:59 <frobenius> palomer, what is "lexer = do xs <- fmap concat (many parseToken)   ..." meaning?
14:31:28 <palomer> oh no, I don't:(
14:31:30 <xerox> > let dany2k = ap (>>=) (const . return . head) in dany2k [1..3]
14:31:32 <lambdabot> [1,1,1]
14:31:47 <palomer> frobenius: that creates the tokenizer
14:31:52 <palomer> (change lexer to tokenizer, if you want)
14:32:09 <frobenius> why fmap and concat?
14:32:59 <palomer> @type concat
14:33:00 <lambdabot> forall a. [[a]] -> [a]
14:33:08 <frobenius> sure
14:33:09 <frobenius> I know them
14:33:15 <palomer> good question
14:33:21 <palomer> I stole the tokenizer code from Cale
14:33:25 <palomer> so you'll have to ask him
14:33:26 <frobenius> hehe
14:33:39 <palomer> oh, and if you want to give credit, give it to Cale
14:33:40 <palomer> too
14:33:50 <frobenius> full names then...
14:35:02 <frobenius> can you paste the lambda parser too?
14:35:09 <frobenius> Insert your full name if you want to!
14:35:19 <palomer> Cale Gibbard, something something
14:35:21 <frobenius> (not sure how much I will use of it)
14:35:31 <Cale> hm?
14:35:34 <Cale> what about me?
14:35:49 <frobenius> you get the nobel prize
14:35:53 <frobenius> for writing a parser
14:35:55 <Cale> :)
14:35:59 <palomer> actually, the tokenizer
14:36:02 <palomer> I wrote the parser
14:36:05 <palomer> (and it's very ugly)
14:36:27 <frobenius> ok
14:36:28 <frobenius> nevermind
14:36:30 <newsham> musasabi: thank you.  that did the trick.
14:36:53 <frobenius> thanks and bye, I will check your code when I get time
14:37:18 <palomer> np
14:49:07 <newsham> when is `seq` or ($!)   needd?
14:49:10 <newsham> needed
14:49:39 <monochrom> When you want eager evaluation.
14:49:56 <Cale> let me give an example
14:50:07 <monochrom> One use of eager evaluation is to save space.
14:50:18 <Cale> You generally want things to be eager when collapsing a large structure into a small one
14:50:42 <Cale> Let's say we're evaluating  foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3]
14:50:54 <Cale> just for concreteness,
14:51:02 <Cale> foldl f z []     =  z
14:51:02 <Cale> foldl f z (x:xs) =  foldl f (f z x) xs
14:51:10 <Cale> so
14:51:24 <Cale> foldl (+) 0 [1,2,3] = foldl (+) (0 + 1) [2,3]
14:51:35 <Cale> = foldl (+) ((0 + 1) + 2) [3]
14:51:48 <Cale> = foldl (+) (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) []
14:51:54 <Cale> = (((0 + 1) + 2) + 3)
14:51:59 <Cale> = (((1 + 2) + 3)
14:52:05 <Cale> = (3 + 3)
14:52:08 <Cale> = 6
14:52:29 <Cale> note that we build up a large expression and then collapse it
14:52:57 <Cale> that expression is as large as the original list, except that it *will* be in memory all at once, whereas the list might have been lazily generated
14:53:15 <newsham> so you'r esaying if you used seq you can force early collapsing in intermediate expressions
14:53:18 <Cale> further, it may even be so large as to cause a stack overflow when it's forced
14:53:21 <Cale> yes
14:53:29 <newsham> ok, that makes sense
14:53:44 <Cale> foldl' is a modified foldl which seq's the intermediate results as it proceeds
14:53:53 <Cale> > foldl (+) 0 [1..1000000]
14:53:55 <lambdabot> Exception: stack overflow
14:53:59 <Cale> > foldl' (+) 0 [1..1000000]
14:54:01 <lambdabot> 500000500000
14:54:31 <Cale> foldl' f a []     = a
14:54:31 <Cale> foldl' f a (x:xs) = (foldl' f $! f a x) xs
14:54:49 <newsham> lazy evaluator doesnt have any smarts in it to start reducing things to save some space?
14:55:05 <Cale> well, it's hard to tell
14:55:18 <Cale> there have been experiments with partially-eager evaluators
14:55:31 <Cale> but in general, it's quite a difficult problem
14:55:59 <Cale> there are plenty of cases where you want to fold lazily too
14:56:03 <SamB> newsham: do you expect the GC to solve the halting problem too?
14:56:07 <newsham> this came up in the context of some c2hs test case:  val   <- liftM cIntConv $ {#get _point.y#} $! unPoint pnt
14:56:16 <newsham> samb: well, yah, if at all possible, it would be nice :)
14:56:26 <SamB> newsham: I agree!
14:56:36 <SamB> it would be nice!
14:56:39 <newsham> also this whole NP thing should be reduced.
14:57:46 <newsham> in this case unPoint just unwraps the C type (I think).  why do they want to force seq in this case? 
14:57:47 <Cale> The general heuristic I use is, if you're collapsing a large structure in a small one which is dependent on most of, or all of, the large structure, then you want strict evaluation. Otherwise, you generally want to leave it lazy.
14:58:00 <Cale> s/in/into/
14:58:04 <musasabi> newsham: if you start from the simple proof of P=NP, I could work on the collapsing part for haskell.
14:58:16 <newsham> is there a lot of heavy machinery behind the c2hs marshalling stuff that benefits from seq?
14:58:19 <musasabi> so given the proof, the solution is easy.
14:58:54 <newsham> musa: cool, I happen to have one.  intel has a branch on p and branch on np instruction in its set
14:59:01 <newsham> so i just made this small program 
15:00:13 <newsham> if both branches are taken or if neither is taken it returns true. otherwise false.
15:00:32 <newsham> it appears p != np :(
15:01:13 <monochrom> Those hardware people have certainly made miraculous progress.
15:02:16 <newsham> mono: when I look at the performance improvements due to hardware its definitely putting to shame the performance improvements due to compiler advances.
15:02:37 <newsham> one's a nice exponential, the other is nearly flat lined
15:02:43 <newsham> :\
15:02:50 <Cale> newsham: GHC has made some impressive advancements as far as Haskell is concerned
15:03:06 <newsham> http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/law.htm
15:03:20 * SamB tries to download the rest of Miyuki with Conjure
15:04:41 <Cale> newsham: right, I agree with that page, but while enhancing productivity, you don't want to outright lose lots of performance either
15:05:43 <newsham> why not?  next years computers will fix the problem :)
15:06:07 <Keal> i use an 8088 :(
15:06:08 <Cale> well, they'll make things faster anyway
15:07:29 <SamB> I for one am still on a PII 450
15:07:32 <newsham> anyone here use c2hs?  I'm trying to build the stuff in c2hs-0.14.5/c2hs/tests
15:07:46 <newsham> c# c2hs Simple.chs
15:07:47 <newsham> c2hs: Errors during expansion of binding hooks:
15:07:47 <newsham> Simple.chs:5: (column 16) [ERROR]
15:07:47 <newsham>   >>> Unknown identifier!
15:07:47 <newsham>   Cannot find a definition for `foo' in the header file.
15:07:47 <Keal> my 8088 gets 10mhz max
15:07:58 <Cale> augh, why do people make zip files which unpack into the current directory!
15:08:22 <SamB> and Conjure needs startup profiling badly
15:08:36 <Keal> because winzip has a glitch
15:08:38 <twb> Cale: that's why you use -d :-)
15:08:38 <newsham> keal: 8088 is not energy efficient.  you're wasting more money in energy than you're getting in cpu performance.
15:09:20 <Cale> twb: no, the package has a directory structure which includes many files at the root level
15:09:33 <Keal> i got my 8088 running ansyncronous before :)
15:09:38 <newsham> why do people unzip/untar stuff without looking at the contents first?
15:09:43 <Keal> i got my 8088 running asyncronous* before :)
15:09:47 <twb> Cale: I'm saying "unzip -d foo foo.zip", which puts everything in foo/ and preserves structure.
15:10:08 <Cale> twb: okay
15:10:26 <SamB> Cale: zip files don't have the same convention as tarballs do
15:10:28 <Keal> Cale got pwned
15:10:41 <Keal> lets all laugh
15:10:43 <SamB> s/convetnion/conventions/
15:11:11 <newsham>  \ls -1crt > /tmp/file; vi /tmp/file; mv `cat /tmp/file` dstdir
15:11:23 <twb> SamB: I think it's just that there are more stupid zip users than tar users.
15:11:35 <newsham> that will list the files chronologically so you can seperate the new from the old
15:11:53 <SamB> twb: no, it really isn't.
15:12:02 <twb> newsham: that assumes there are no spaces in the filename.
15:12:08 <SamB> its just that the zip users like to name their own directories
15:12:12 <newsham> yes.
15:12:14 <Keal> my mom's computer has files from the 80's and files from 2008
15:12:26 <twb> SamB: whatever.  I don't care enough to argue.
15:12:51 <SamB> Keal: what happened to her clock?
15:13:10 <newsham> anyone here know c2hs?  their own tests dont seem to be working for me.
15:13:12 <SamB> anyway, laugh not, rather profile!
15:13:16 <Keal> no diea
15:14:49 <Keal> if it were truely an archive new/old wouldnt work
15:14:56 <newsham> nevermind, figured it out.
15:17:56 <Keal> aliens prolly think we are meat monsters
15:18:40 <monochrom> or vegetarian freaks
15:19:01 <Keal> no the fact our skin is visible MEAT
15:19:06 <Keal> prolly freaks aliens out
15:19:18 <monochrom> oh, that kind of meat monster
15:19:33 <Keal> think about about
15:19:47 <Keal> whats the first thing you see when you look at a human.
15:19:53 <Keal> surface meat
15:20:43 <Keal> not many other mammels look like that
15:20:53 <monochrom> I aced my highschool biology classes, so I tend to think there is a difference between skin and meat.
15:21:13 <Keal> skin is still meat tho
15:21:15 <tic> skin is protein, so is meat. :)
15:21:25 <newsham> ok, here's a question.  c2hs generated a file that does an "import C2HS", but when I invoke ghc it doesnt know where to find it.  How do I direct ghc to include the directory it is in in its search?
15:21:36 <monochrom> well finger nail is protein too.
15:21:47 <Keal> its not meat
15:21:59 <Keal> hair and fingernail are not meat
15:22:03 <monochrom> yeah tell that to tic.
15:22:10 <Keal> humans are the only primate that is mostly surface meat
15:22:15 <Keal> its freakish to aliens
15:22:20 <Cale> you have to be made out of something
15:22:36 <Cale> I don't see why it would be more or less freakish than anything else
15:22:49 <Keal> i bet greys shavethemselves so they dont freak us out
15:22:55 <newsham> there are lots of hairless and featherless animals.  you're too mamal centric
15:23:02 <newsham> try an octopus or a jelly fish.
15:23:04 <newsham> also not haskell.
15:23:19 <monochrom> haskell is meat
15:23:25 <Cale> yeah, this is so off topic that it's ridiculous
15:23:35 <Keal> hehe
15:23:37 <newsham> ok, so here's a haskell question, how do I make ghc find C2HS?
15:24:04 <monochrom> is it a haskell question?
15:24:17 <newsham> ghc is a haskell compiler 
15:25:08 <Heffalump> why do you think ghc should find c2hs?
15:26:03 <Keal> Cale it is very easy to go off topic fishing with something like that in a channel of highly intelligent intuitive minds :D
15:26:10 <Keal> hehe
15:26:12 <Keal> sorry
15:26:16 <newsham> because its in one of the c2hs test cases?  i assume their test cases are working test cases
15:26:17 <newsham> root@discover# c2hs structs.h Structs.chs
15:26:17 <newsham> root@discover# ghc -ffi Structs.hs structs.c
15:26:17 <newsham> Structs.chs:7:0:
15:26:17 <newsham>     Failed to load interface for `C2HS':
15:26:47 <monochrom> I am intelligent logical, not intelligent intuitive, as you see.
15:26:55 <newsham> keal: sounds like someone trying to sound intelligent.
15:27:35 <Keal> naw just seeing how offtopic i could get everyone to get themselves on their own as part of a boids style experiment
15:28:42 <Heffalump> and the thing hasn't compiled C2HS yet?
15:28:57 <Keal> someone needs to write a boids for haskell that emulates humans going on and off topic
15:29:03 <newsham> heffalump: i built and installed the c2hs package according to its documentation
15:29:14 <newsham> I know where teh C2HS.hs file is on the filesystem.
15:29:37 <newsham> but apparently its not located in a place that ghc searches (why not?)
15:30:29 <Keal> sound intruiging Cale?
15:30:34 <Heffalump> where is it? What OS? Is it actaully compiled yet?
15:30:43 <monochrom> good luck
15:31:05 <newsham> /usr/local/lib/c2hs-0.14.5/C2HS.hs, not compiled yet.
15:31:23 <Heffalump> if it's not compiled, that ghc command-line won't find it.
15:31:34 <Heffalump> because ghc wasn't told to follow dependencies
15:31:50 <Heffalump> (and even if it was, it probably wouldn't follow them into /usr/local/, unless the thing being compiled also lived there)
15:32:45 <newsham> no, thing being compiled doesnt live there..  so what do I want to tell ghc to follow deps, and what do I do to make it search that location (and also, why isnt this installed in a searchable place for ghc?  its a module needed by c2hs generated code often
15:32:49 <newsham> if I understand right)
15:33:02 <Heffalump> I think you need to arrange for it to be compiled
15:33:16 <newsham> so just add that .hs to the cmd line then (with full path)?
15:33:19 <Heffalump> because users can't expect to be able to write the objects/interfaces into /usr/local if they have to compile it
15:33:40 <Heffalump> I would compile it separately
15:33:51 <Heffalump> while in that directory
15:34:03 <Heffalump> but there's probably some part of the c2hs installation process that's going wrong
15:34:07 <Heffalump> I'm not familiar with it, though
15:34:35 <newsham> ghc -c C2HS.hs in that lib, then later ref the <full/path>C2HS.o ?
15:35:22 <Heffalump> ghc -c C2HS.hs in that dir, then later arrange for full/path to be on the includes or libraries path
15:35:33 <Heffalump> (I can't quite remember which, or both, of those paths it needs to be on)
15:36:40 <Heffalump> but the ghc docs should tell you
15:36:48 <newsham> thanks.
15:37:01 <Heffalump> but as I said, I'm sure some aspect of the installation process has gone wrong
15:37:19 <newsham> *nod*  I should mail the author I guess
15:39:59 <newsham> I dont understand how to make ghc search other directories for sources that are being imported
15:40:43 <SamB> Heffalump: oh, the import is done
15:40:48 <Heffalump> SamB: cool
15:40:51 <Heffalump> shall I delete that mbox?
15:40:56 <SamB> Heffalump: so you can get rid of that mbox now
15:41:17 <Heffalump> newsham: why would you import sources, not compiled objects?
15:41:58 <Heffalump> certainly I don't think it makes sense to do it from a central installation like c2hs appears to be.
15:42:23 <Heffalump> if you do want to do it, I think -i<dir> is the right way
15:44:59 <SamB> See http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.network.bit-torrent.conjure.devel or news.gmane.org/gmane.network.bit-torrent.conjure.devel to see our shiny new gmane group...
15:46:16 <SamB> huh. I'don't remember having seen a posting/day graph with a tick at 0.5 before...
15:47:16 <newsham> heffalump: the Structs.hs file does an import and needs to find the module definition somehow.
15:47:34 <newsham> I'm somewhat new to ghc (been using hugs mostly) so I might just be missing something obvious
15:48:18 <SamB> newsham: .hi files!
15:48:29 <Heffalump> newsham: right, and I think it should find the compiled version, not the source.
15:48:47 <newsham> # ghc -ffi Structs.hs structs.c /usr/local/lib/c2hs-0.14.5/C2HS.hi
15:48:47 <newsham> Structs.chs:7:0:
15:48:47 <newsham>     Failed to load interface for `C2HS':
15:48:58 <newsham> I still need to somehow direct it to that directory 
15:49:03 <Heffalump> that error means it is looking for the compiled version (.hi file, later will need .o file), and can't.
15:49:13 <newsham> *nod* not in search path
15:49:17 <Heffalump> right, and I think you should look into changing the includes and/or libraries path, as I said above.
15:49:34 <Heffalump> Which I think are the -I and -L flags. But I don't remember exactly, because the ghc documentation is easy to read to find this stuff out :_0
15:49:37 <Heffalump> s/_0/-)/
15:50:08 <newsham> ahh.. -i/usr/local/... is what i was looking for
15:50:09 <newsham> thanks
15:50:22 <Heffalump> I actually don't think it's -i, BICBW
15:50:43 <newsham> # ghc -ffi -i/usr/local/lib/c2hs-0.14.5 Structs.hs structs.c /usr/local/lib/c2hs-0.14.5/C2HS.o
15:50:45 <newsham> that worked
15:51:04 <Heffalump> I think you should use -L
15:51:06 <Heffalump> BICBW.
15:51:30 <Heffalump> I think I am wrong, actually. Never mind.
15:51:40 <Heffalump> maybe it's not so simple to work it out from the docs :-)
15:58:55 <dons> moin
16:00:26 <Heffalump> dons: are you familiar with c2hs?
16:00:34 <SamB> dons: hello! have you seen our faux blog?
16:00:53 <SamB> See http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.network.bit-torrent.conjure.devel
16:03:27 <dons> Heffalump, only a little. dcoutts is though.
16:04:34 <Heffalump> ok, never mind then (just newsham was having problems with the installation for some reason)
16:04:55 <dons> musasabi, yeah. a nice array interface to the C level primops would be useful
16:05:48 <dons> SamB. very nice.
16:06:21 <musasabi> dons: the whole "lets unbox IO by hand and use the primops in the user code" just is not very pretty
16:06:44 * dcoutts agrees with musasabi 
16:07:16 <dcoutts> Heffalump, c2hs?
16:07:23 <dons> musasabi, I agree. I do not advocated it.
16:07:37 <SamB> primops?
16:07:41 <SamB> thats just silly!
16:07:42 <dons> it just is faster than not stepping inside IO and not using primops.
16:08:09 <dons> as you can see, I write a non-evil version, then can sometimes double the speed by the evilness
16:08:13 * dons shrugs
16:08:17 <Heffalump> dcoutts: see scrollback for newsham's problem with it. Should it have ended up with just source in /usr/local/... ?
16:08:31 <musasabi> SamB: like this:
16:08:32 <musasabi>             t <- IO $ \s -> 
16:08:32 <musasabi>                 case readIntOffAddr# p1# 0# s of
16:08:32 <musasabi>                     (# s, p1 #) -> case readIntOffAddr# p1# (n# -# 1#) s of
16:08:32 <musasabi>                         (# s, pn #) -> (# s, not (p1 ==# 0# || pn ==# (n# -# 1#)) #)
16:08:47 <permanewb> I'm guessing someone here might know what this is called. Say you have breads 'white', 'wheat', 'rye', condiments 'mayonaise', 'mustard', and fillings 'tuna', 'turkey' the set of sandwhichs you can create is a ____? Is it a permutation?
16:08:58 <SamB> would be interesting to write evil version and then figure out how to do without the evil...
16:09:16 <SamB> if you can see what is happening through the evil, anyway
16:09:26 <musasabi> dons: why is inlining not enough? any idea.
16:09:27 <dons> so you didn't submit the evil fannkuch? or did you submit them anyway.
16:09:39 <dons> not sure why musasabi.
16:09:42 <dcoutts> newsham, you're not supposed to import the C2HS.hs file from where it's installed in the file system.
16:09:58 <dcoutts> c2hs --copy-library
16:10:01 <dcoutts> is what you want
16:10:21 <dcoutts> basically you're supposed to include a copy in your source tree
16:10:40 <dcoutts> so don't fiddle with include paths
16:11:07 <newsham> dcouts: ahh! thank you sir.
16:11:18 <palomer> I just wrote a type inference algorithm in 62 lines
16:11:27 <musasabi> dons: I don't know whether it makes sense.
16:11:32 <Heffalump> dcoutts: oh. Why not just compile it in place?
16:11:36 <Keal> i almost killed my brother just now
16:11:38 <musasabi> dons: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all note the scoring method.
16:11:42 <Keal> i am serious
16:11:45 <newsham> that worked much better.
16:11:46 <Keal> he could have died
16:11:46 <musasabi> dons: 1 cpu, 1 memory, 1 loc
16:11:51 <Keal> and i would have gone to prison
16:11:54 <dcoutts> Heffalump, that's just not the way its set up
16:12:09 <SamB> Lemmih: why does conjure start listening for peer connections before it checks the store?
16:12:15 <Keal> and then i almost went after to kill my mom
16:12:16 <Heffalump> fair enough
16:12:21 <Keal> :'(
16:12:25 <dcoutts> besides that way you can modify it or include it into another module
16:12:29 <newsham> c2hs --copy-library structs.h Structs.chs; ghc -ffi Structs.chs C2HS.hs structs.c
16:12:36 <Keal> what the f is wrong with me!?
16:12:45 <musasabi> thus if you make it 25% faster, but double the loc, it will actually score lower.
16:12:58 <dcoutts> newsham, c2hs --copy-library jsut copies C2HS.hs into the current dir
16:13:05 <Lemmih> SamB: Say what?
16:13:06 <newsham> yah, I noticed.
16:13:25 <dcoutts> newsham, so you're putting the C2HS module into your source tree
16:13:36 <dcoutts> and then using it / building it normally
16:13:37 <SamB> conjure: Server is awaiting connections. Socket: <socket: 5>
16:13:37 <SamB> conjure: (server) got connect from: "CPE001404660d4f-CM0013718a4768.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com":4633 (handle: {handle: <socket: 13>})

16:13:54 * joelr1 waves
16:13:59 <joelr1> does anyone know prolog?
16:14:00 <dcoutts> newsham, you don't want to expose it in the package you build of course
16:14:13 <dcoutts> since it'd clash with every other package that uses c2hs
16:14:17 <SamB> also, it is spewing junk...
16:14:32 <dons> musasabi, hmm.
16:14:38 <SamB>  (h\
16:14:38 <SamB>     : (server) got connect from: "CPE001404660d4f-CM0013718a4768.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com":4673 (handle: {handle: <socket: 19>})

16:14:38 <ndm> joelr1: i used to...
16:14:56 <dons> the rev-comp is a more like 10x faster
16:14:57 <joelr1> ndm: how do you run http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/zurg/zurg.pl ?
16:15:04 <dons> same with memory usage.
16:15:20 <joelr1> ndm: i believe i loaded it into gnu prolog but i don't know what the M argument to solution is
16:15:22 <musasabi> joelr1: I think it can be embedded into a monad ;)
16:15:25 <dons> and we're ranked somewhere near last on rev-comp.
16:15:31 <ndm> joelr1: solution(X).
16:15:35 <joelr1> musasabi:  ;)
16:15:40 <joelr1> ndm: that's it?
16:15:48 <ndm> pretty much, the . is important
16:15:52 <Lemmih> SamB: Hm, yeah. We should probably scan the torrent because we start the server and the client. Send a patch.
16:15:54 <ndm> and it will bind X to the result
16:16:05 <joelr1> ndm: i get an error. dang
16:16:16 <ndm> joelr1: what?
16:16:34 <musasabi> dons: ok, I'll put fastest revcomp into the shootout.
16:16:34 <SamB> Lemmih: I would but I can't tell where the part where it scans is!
16:16:59 <musasabi> dons: I think we should try to locate the patterns out of there and try to get an Array module into fptools that does the things.
16:17:01 <joelr1> ndm: care to join #prolog so as not to clutter this channel? it looks like i'm missing the subtract proc :(
16:17:06 <dons> now, with the fannkuch, we're still much slower, and my evil fannkuch was 1.1x the C version on my box.
16:17:21 <Lemmih> SamB: See Conjure.Client.newActiveTorrent. It calls 'scanTorrent'.
16:17:22 <dons> so I would like to see the evil version submitted. But also a library would be good.
16:17:47 <dons> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=fannkuch&lang=all
16:18:17 <dons> the pure one is still 9x slower. whereas the evil one is more like 1.something x slower.
16:20:38 <musasabi> dons: revcomp went in.
16:20:46 <dons> so with fannkuch, the line count is just under 2x longer, but it will be around 8x faster and 2x less memory.
16:21:02 <dons> so that still improves the tally, no?
16:21:51 <dons> I agree though with this array interface. I think I'll write that today in fact.
16:24:29 <musasabi> fannkuch went in.
16:24:58 <dons> ok great. quite possibly a lot of the uglyness disappears with a fast string library anyway.
16:25:00 <musasabi> In addition to the loc shootout is a place to show of Haskell, and that is one reason I like pretty entries.
16:25:37 <dons> yes. I agree with that. these were particularly hard problems without decent packed strings.
16:26:30 <musasabi> well if 6.6 has fps it solves most of the problems :-)
16:27:04 <musasabi> except for the floating point array programs.
16:27:16 <palomer> hrm
16:27:23 <dons> these problems: fasta, k-nucleotide, n-body, regex-dna and reverse-complement are the tricky ones.
16:27:24 <palomer> doing the occurs check with references is dirty business
16:27:34 <dons> with fps, I think fasta, k-nuc, regex and reverse are ok.
16:28:00 <palomer> how is fps coming along?
16:28:11 <dons> i note the current n-body is 105 loc.
16:28:33 <dons> palomer, well it's pretty stable. i'm waiting for a chance to merge with SimonM's packedstring. which is very fast.
16:28:34 <musasabi> dons: I don't like my submissions for e.g. spectral-norm very much - http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=spectralnorm&lang=ghc&id=3
16:28:40 <dons> the result will go into fptools.
16:28:43 <musasabi> it is fast, but not they way I like it.
16:29:57 <palomer> hrm, it seems that gmail is filtering out my self invites
16:30:31 <dons> hmm. for these imperative algos, I like, as you say, swap and a[n] = m
16:30:34 <SamB> palomer: want me to send one?
16:30:43 <palomer> SamB: sure, remarquable@gmail.com
16:31:17 <SamB> okay
16:31:33 <musasabi> palomer: it might be a good idea not to paste the address in a form recognized by bots to the channel.
16:31:45 <musasabi> (as spam bots might traverse the logs on the web)
16:31:45 <dons> that's the main bottleneck. mutable variables on there own aren't needed, you just paramaterise loops with some `n' instead. but low level mutable array swap, read and write. and fgets, would be good
16:31:56 <palomer> musasabi: you think that there are evil bots lurking around?
16:32:12 <musasabi> palomer: nope, but I think googlable logs account for evil bots.
16:32:26 <palomer> oh my!
16:32:31 <palomer> kill the bots!
16:32:37 <palomer> bah, I'm getting rid of that address
16:32:40 <dons> palomer, have you ever read lambdabot's Evil plugin? what do you think it's for..
16:32:42 <palomer> which is why I'm self inviting

16:32:58 <musasabi> dons: yes, those would help a lot.
16:32:59 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: devils eval
16:33:02 <palomer> @evil
16:33:03 <lambdabot> <stdin>: hGetLine: end of file
16:33:07 <palomer> @devils eval
16:33:10 <lambdabot> No match for "eval".
16:33:22 <dons> ok ok. i'm joking. there is no evil bit^H^H^Hplugin
16:33:26 <palomer> @evil \x -> x
16:33:27 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Show (t -> t))
16:33:41 <palomer> @evil (\x -> x) 5
16:33:42 <lambdabot> 5
16:33:51 <palomer> seems that evil is the same as eval
16:34:33 <dons> musasabi, but it's very encouraging how highly ranked, even with 3 or 4 flawed entries
16:49:23 <joelk> Is there a function for applying a list of functions, ala: pipeline [] a = a; pipeline (f:fs) a = pipeline fs $ f a   ?
16:49:57 <dons> interesting.
16:50:12 <musasabi> > foldl (.) id [(+1),(*2)] 500
16:50:14 <lambdabot> 1001
16:50:23 <musasabi> > foldr (.) id [(+1),(*2)] 500
16:50:25 <lambdabot> 1001
16:50:44 <musasabi> > foldl (flip .) id [(+1),(*2)] 500
16:50:45 <lambdabot>   Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: c = b -> c
16:50:45 <lambdabot>   Expected type: (b -> a -> b -> c) -> b -> b -> a -> b -> c
16:50:45 <lambdabot>   Inferred type: (b -> a -> b -> c) -> b -> b -> a -> c
16:50:49 <musasabi> grah.
16:51:04 <SyntaxNinja> > foldl1 (.)  [(+1),(*2)] 500
16:51:06 <lambdabot> 1001
16:51:18 <joelk> Ah, I'll just leave my pipeline func as is then.
16:51:22 <SyntaxNinja> heh
16:51:59 <palomer> > foldl1 (.)  [\x -> i*x | i < 50] 40
16:52:00 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `i'
16:52:15 <palomer> can you create function list comprehensions?
16:52:27 <dons> functions are just values, so yes.
16:52:32 <ihope> What's i taken from?
16:52:38 <ihope> [1..50]?
16:53:01 <musasabi> > foldl1 (.)  [\x -> i*x | i <- [1.. 50]] 40

16:53:58 <newsham> > "test"
16:53:59 <lambdabot> "test"
16:56:44 <joelk> dons, SamB,  have you seen my modified google command for lambdabot?
16:57:07 <Lemmih> What did you change?
16:57:13 <SamB> joelk: has it been applied, instlaled, reloaded?
16:57:32 <SamB> s/intlaled/rebuilt/
16:58:05 <joelk> No, I've never submitted before, so I was waiting until someone was around to tell me what to do.
16:58:10 <joelk> but there's this:
16:58:12 <dons> joelk, sounds good . mail me the patch.
16:58:24 <dons> darcs send

17:00:44 <joelk> one draw back is this:
17:01:07 <SamB> drawback?
17:01:17 * SamB waits patiently to see it

17:01:23 <joelk_bot> Avogadro's number * 1 = 6.02214199 x 10^23
17:01:37 <SamB> why's that?
17:02:16 <joelk> In the first case google sends a http 302, in thesecond it gives you the result of your calculation instead.
17:03:07 <SamB> joelk: sounds less annoying than the other way!
17:03:26 <SamB> I mean, if you wanted to calculate you could just tack on a * 1
17:04:06 <joelk> yep.
17:04:08 <SamB> $wikipedia avogadros number * 1
17:04:11 <joelk_bot> No Result Found.

17:04:28 <SamB> what? wikipedia doesn't have a calculator function?
17:04:32 <joelk> oh good.
17:05:57 <joelk> dons, anyway to tell darcs to ignore my Config.hs?
17:06:39 <dons> darcs record MyPlugin.hs only?
17:06:47 <joelk> ah

17:12:01 <SamB> or maybe it is a teaser
17:12:10 <dons> @karma+ JaffaCake
17:12:11 <lambdabot> JaffaCake's karma raised to 5.
17:12:21 <SamB> that would depend on whether or not GHC can actually read utf-8 sourcecode!
17:12:53 <dons> i'll have to read the last couple of days of unicode commits
17:18:41 <Lemmih> SamB: Your TODO patch conflicts with mine.

17:22:23 <Lemmih> SamB: Try again (:
17:25:49 <ihope> Hmm, this prime number list is evaluating pretty slowly.

17:39:36 <ulfdoz> h, 1
17:39:38 <Lemmih> SamB: Looks like a peer id is messing the terminal. We should probably escape them.
17:40:06 <SamB> Lemmih: I thought those were supposed to be printable
17:40:22 <SamB> maybe you swapped them with infohash somehow?

17:41:02 <ihope> Aww.
17:41:56 <SamB> Lemmih: I mean, back when I was first doing the tracker client code, I ran into trouble trying to use arbitrary 20-byte strings for peer_id
17:42:26 <Lemmih> SamB: A peer id isn't necessarily printable.
17:42:49 <Lemmih> SamB: The RFC just states that it should be unique.
17:42:52 <SamB> Lemmih: didn't it say in the tracker protocol spec that it was?
17:43:15 <Lemmih> "How the peer ID is obtained is outside the scope of this document, but a peer must make sure that the peer ID it uses has a very high probability of being unique in the swarm."
17:43:41 <SamB> oh. its just supposed to be unencoded?
17:43:51 <SamB> thats icky!
17:44:04 <SamB> is that even URL-compliant?
17:44:28 <SamB> remind me NOT to write a tracker!
17:45:22 <musasabi> protocols with vague specs are evil.
17:45:46 <ihope> Hmm. When I run sieve [1000000..], it gets slow pretty quickly...
17:46:04 <ihope> WAY before 1000000000000.
17:46:16 <SamB> Lemmih: are you sure that is the peer id?
17:46:36 <SamB> oh, also conjure keeps dying with no indication of why
17:46:45 <Lemmih> SamB: Pretty sure. Try escaping the peer ids and see if the problem goes away.
17:47:07 <Lemmih> SamB: Must likely because it's killed by sigHUB.
17:47:11 <Lemmih> *Most
17:51:01 <SamB> Lemmih: and where is it printed?

17:55:25 <Lemmih> SamB: Conjure/Client.hs line 77.
18:02:50 <SamB> Lemmih: still dies for some reason
18:07:18 <Lemmih> Did you ignore sigHUB?
18:07:36 <Lemmih> Argh, sigPIPE I meant.
18:07:46 <SamB> sigPIPE what?
18:09:38 <Lemmih> You should ignore sigPIPE.
18:11:26 <palomer> someone give me a small term with a really big type

18:21:32 <lennart> but without let polymorphism I don't think you can get the exponential blowup.  but i'm not sure
18:30:03 <lennart> hmmmmm
18:31:28 <SamB> Lemmih: you still have no default target email for "darcs send"
18:33:23 <SamB> Lemmih: also, seems to be working now
18:35:53 <Lemmih> How do I set the default target email for "darcs send"?
18:38:11 <newsham> whats a good real world c2hs example?
18:38:35 <Cale> doesn't gtk2hs use c2hs?
18:38:38 <newsham> i know gtk2hs uses it, but it looks like it doesnt support running an "external" c2hs
18:38:52 <Cale> external?
18:39:10 <newsham> --with-c2hs=yes
18:39:10 <newsham>   Search for a c2hs installation in the current PATH.
18:39:10 <newsham> NOTE: using an external version of c2hs is not currently working!
18:39:10 <newsham> --with-c2hs=<path to your c2hs-config>
18:39:10 <newsham>   Use this specific installation of c2hs. Make sure you specify the c2hs-config
18:39:10 <newsham>   program, not c2hs itself.
18:39:17 <newsham> except I have no c2hs-config file anywhere
18:39:36 <SamB> Lemmih: _darcs/prefs/email I think
18:47:05 <dons> newsham, it only uses the intree c2hs, because the external c2hs hadn't yet synced with changes made by the gtk2hs people
18:47:24 <dons> the latest c2hs i think is the same as gtk2hs's in-tree c2hs.
18:47:42 <dons> I think Cale was generating enlightenment bindings with c2hs. that's the kind of thing
18:48:08 <dons> take a C library api, mechanically generated haskell bindings to that lib.
18:48:47 <newsham> i'm hoping to make some small bindings soon, so I wanted to see other examples
18:50:24 <Cale> It's not *that* much more convenient than using the FFI directly, but the FFI is already pretty good. It is somewhat of an improvement as far as how much typing you have to do.
18:50:41 <Cale> Have you read the FFI spec?
18:53:41 <newsham> i have glanced at it..  i'm not too happy with the reading :)
18:54:05 <newsham> definitely not as charming as shakespeare
18:58:31 <palomer> lennart: yeah, I have it
18:58:41 <palomer> lennart: btw, what's the typing rule for polymorphic recursion?
18:59:14 <palomer> Cale: can you get an exponential type when only using lambda calculus?
19:06:02 <SamB> Lemmih: oh, someone should do an icon for Conjure
19:06:31 <SamB> so we can serve it as a favicon for the HTTP interface ;-)
19:11:25 <Lemmih> (:
19:12:57 <Lemmih> SamB: Perhaps something like http://www.effectivebrand.com/ToolbarImagesDir/CT7252/703272204Magic%20Wand.gif
19:17:32 <musasabi> how does one draw the conjuration/summoning of a lambda ?
19:18:21 <dons> a lambda coming out of a bottle? or a genii lamp?
19:18:41 <SamB> Lemmih: perhaps
19:18:41 <dons> or a pentagram, with a lambda appearing out of smoke?
19:19:05 <SamB> musasabi: no, lambda does the conjuring
19:19:25 <SamB> you conjure things like Anime and Manga usually, methinks
19:19:45 <dons> ok. so a lambda pulling pr0n out of a network cable.
19:20:10 * Lemmih laughs.
19:20:21 <SamB> not pr0n!
19:20:27 <SamB> anime! there is a difference, believe it or not!
19:20:48 <dons> you say anime, but you mean pr0n ;)
19:20:51 * musasabi thinks about rpg when thinking of conjuring
19:21:00 <SamB> however, a favicon has severely limited pixelage
19:21:16 <musasabi> pr0n anime?
19:21:52 <SamB> dons: is this about my liking Chobits?
19:22:12 <dons> don't know what that is. just teasing you ;)
19:22:42 <musasabi> Chobits has an acute lack of cute male characters. Chii was amusing for a few eps though.
19:23:27 <SamB> can I help it if I am easily amused?
19:24:00 <SamB> ... and doesn't that make american TV that much more pathetic?
19:24:22 <monochrom> You should not watch TV
19:25:23 <SamB> monochrom: you are freaking me out
19:25:40 * palomer wishes he could write functions which could masquerade as constructors
19:25:43 <palomer> wouldn't that be cool?
19:25:53 <SamB> anyway, I don't watch american TV unless someone else turns it on
19:26:12 <musasabi> TV-news can be fun from time to time.
19:26:20 <musasabi> but many companies put them to web these days.
19:26:23 <SamB> why, the TV in my room has been stuck on composite in for I-don't-know-how-long and I never noticed
19:27:19 <SamB> 'cause all we use it for is DVDs and videogames
19:27:32 * palomer has implemented type inference in less than 60 lines!
19:27:44 <palomer> I could probably do the same in haskell using the ST monad
19:28:32 <palomer> grr, someone give me a pure lambda that would be tricky to type
19:28:54 <SamB> anyway, the wand idea isn't bad...
19:30:06 <dons> \f. (\x. f (x x)) \x. f (x x)   :)
19:30:40 <monochrom> You're evil.
19:30:46 <palomer> @type \f. (\x. f (x x)) \x. f (x x) 
19:30:47 <lambdabot> parse error on input `.'
19:30:53 <palomer> @type \f -> (\x  f (x x)) \x. f (x x) 
19:30:55 <lambdabot> parse error on input `)'
19:31:14 <palomer> @type \f -> (\x -> f (x x)) (\x-> f (x x))
19:31:16 <lambdabot>   Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: t = t -> t1
19:31:16 <lambdabot>   Expected type: t
19:31:28 <palomer> you'll have to give me something that's typable, bucko
19:32:24 <dons> why don't you try the functions in prelude.lam: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/lambdabot/scripts/lambda/prelude.lam
19:32:53 <palomer> thx
19:33:26 <SamB> Lemmih: I'd like to see some kind of visual representation of the piecemap
19:34:32 <tismith> quit
19:46:53 <twb> OK, so I've got WASH installed and I can compile CGI apps OK.
19:47:25 <twb> But when I load my .hs which imports WASH.CGI.CGI, I can't see it's functions like tr from the REPL.
19:47:44 <twb> :load WASH.CGI.CGI reports "module `WASH.CGI.CGI' is a package module"
19:49:41 <SamB> twb: :m
19:49:42 <lispy> twb: um...what if you call it WASH.CGI.CGI.tr
19:50:00 <SamB> also, :m +
19:50:19 <twb> Why do I have to qualify it if I'm importing it in the .hs?
19:50:20 <jemfinch> in generic haskell kind notation, what does "Inl" and "Inr" stand for?
19:50:39 <SamB> you may also be interested in knowing that if you delete the .o file for your module, you can import it with a *
19:50:52 <SamB> which will give you everything that is in scope in the module body
19:50:57 <twb> SamB: huh?
19:51:23 <dons> jemfinch:
19:51:24 <dons> data (:+:) a b = Inl a | Inr b
19:51:25 <dons> data (:*:) a b = a :*: b
19:51:38 <dons> sum and product types.
19:54:27 <jemfinch> dons: I know what they *are*, I'm just curious what they "stand for" -- I.e., I don't like saying "in ell" or "in are" in my head...I'd like to say what it stands for.
19:54:55 <lispy> l for left?
19:55:15 <Cale> Yeah, I'm thinking "in left" and "in right"
19:55:32 <jemfinch> Cale: ah, I figured it was that...just didn't know what the "in" was for.
19:55:34 <Cale> referring to whether the element is in the left or right part of the notional disjoint union
19:55:34 <dons> oh, left injection, right injectoin
19:55:42 <jemfinch> injection!
19:55:56 <twb> What does ## do?
19:56:00 <SamB> twb: if you do :m +WASH.CGI.CGI, it will be added to scope
19:56:05 <dons> unboxed double, iirc, twb.
19:56:14 <twb> dons: what does that mean?
19:56:24 <dons> twb, I might need more context.
19:56:38 <dons> an unboxed double is a raw double on the machine level.
19:56:44 <dons> but your ## might not be that.
19:56:50 <twb> dons: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/WASH/TinyShop.hs
19:56:58 <SamB> ## is also a way to glue CPP tokens together...
19:56:59 <twb> dons: line 12
19:57:06 <dons> also, a cpp ++
19:57:22 <dons> note to self: don't assume everyone else is using unboxed doubles
19:58:01 <dons> that isn't cpp though.
19:58:02 <lispy> dons: why, C assumes that :)
19:58:27 <dons> but it looks like a ++ operator, twb. grep the cgi srcs.
19:58:35 <dons> @index ##
19:58:37 <lambdabot> bzzt
20:03:35 <Lemmih> SamB: Something more visual than what the HTTP UI provides?
20:04:06 <SamB> Lemmih: oh, I did finally figure out what that meant
20:04:11 <SamB> perhaps a simple "legend" would be good though
20:04:23 <Lemmih> Legend?
20:04:48 <SamB> Lemmih: something that helps you to understand it
20:12:09 <SamB> lispy: C assumes a lot
20:14:16 <SamB> Lemmih: oh, and that format might not work too well with proper piece selection...
20:14:36 <Lemmih> eh?
20:15:32 <SamB> well, proper piece selection results in an essentially random set of pieces being finished
20:18:22 * SamB wishes xsidplay wouldn't skip waiting for X
20:18:50 <Lemmih> So why won't that format work well?
20:19:56 <SamB> Lemmih: it is basically RLE!
20:20:34 <SamB> humans are notoriously bad at directly interpreting RLE (or should be)
20:24:32 <Hybrid> ...
20:25:19 <Lemmih> SamB: Well, luckily it's not displaying any imporant information.
20:25:20 <SamB> Hybrid: congratulations on succesfully joining the award-winning Haskell IRC channel!
20:25:44 <Hybrid> Oh cool, a smartarse.
20:26:13 <Cale> okay, so we may not have won many actual awards...
20:27:04 <SamB> Hybrid: okay, so the programmers who were so happy with the channel were too lazy to bother giving us actual awards
20:27:50 <SamB> Hybrid: with practice, you too can become this lazy!
20:28:43 <Hybrid> SamB: Hmm? Wasn't really paying attention.
20:29:25 <SamB> Hybrid: see! lazy already!
20:29:52 <ulfdoz> I know the words, but I don't get the sense:    Illegal polymorphic or qualified type: forall b. (Num b) => a -> b -> (a, b)
20:29:55 <ulfdoz>     When checking the data constructor:
20:29:57 <ulfdoz>       forall a. Stat {getCount :: forall b. (Num b) => a -> b -> (a, b)}
20:30:00 <ulfdoz>     In the data type declaration for `Statistics'
20:30:02 <ulfdoz> Failed, modules loaded: none.
20:30:40 <musasabi> mmh, #haskell - making programmers lazy.
20:31:38 <SamB> musasabi: all in day/nights work!
20:35:04 <Cale> ulfdoz: what exactly is the data declaration that's giving that?
20:38:59 <Keal> i just got banned from math because i not have good ability to convey thoughts :(
20:40:05 <monochrom> or perhaps because you imposed your off-topic talent on them again?
20:40:18 <Keal> no i help!
20:40:22 <Keal> i helped with question!
20:40:32 <Keal> they ask if ellipse can project circle
20:41:17 <Keal> i say ellipse must rest short axis perpendicular to orthogonal light source as long axis tilts toward it at correct slope!
20:41:23 <monochrom> Well if you ask me, it is not sufficient to "want to help".  If you "want to help" but turn out to be incorrect or misleading, you're even worse than not helping.  Just my two cents.
20:41:42 <Keal> i am self learnt and know no terminology nor notation
20:41:45 <Cale> he was actually right, if a little hard to understand
20:41:49 <Keal> i must explain odd
20:41:53 <Keal> yes Cale!
20:41:58 * Keal huggles Cale
20:42:27 <Keal> i lack in verbal and social expression, it is a disability
20:42:36 <Keal> therefore i had to teach self math
20:42:37 <Cale> just, take care :)
20:43:12 <Keal> it take me 2 hours to find way to freenode with crippled wifi
20:44:54 <Keal> sometimes i can talk 100%
20:44:56 <Keal> other times not
20:45:39 <Keal> sometimes i wish haskell had a 3d environment to push and slide and recombine graphical geometric representations in
20:45:57 <Keal> akin to hackers movie
20:46:08 <Cale> heh
20:46:19 <Keal> :)
20:46:23 <Keal> it my wish
20:46:23 <Cale> Have you written any neat code in Haskell?
20:46:34 <Keal> no not have linux yet :(
20:46:40 <Cale> you don't need linux
20:46:44 <Keal> yay
20:46:49 <Keal> me never know that
20:47:17 <Keal> i brilliant . just lack tools
20:47:18 <Cale> GHC runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD, and possibly other operating systems.
20:47:31 <Keal> does it work with GMP
20:47:35 <Cale> yeah
20:47:39 <Keal> yay
20:47:44 <Cale> > 2^500
20:47:46 <lambdabot> 327339060789614187001318969682759915221664204604306478948329136809613379640
20:47:46 <lambdabot> 467455488327009232590415715088668412756007100921725654588539305332852758937
20:47:46 <lambdabot> 6
20:47:52 <Keal> i dont understnad how to use GMP
20:48:00 <musasabi> Keal: you don't need to.
20:48:01 <Cale> you don't have to ;)
20:48:20 <Cale> The default Integer type in Haskell is infinite precision
20:48:25 <musasabi> Keal: it is transparent. Int = machine integer, Integer = either machine integer or GMP for large values.
20:48:39 <Keal> i need 3d envrion i can designate tiles that show parabola arc etc and be able to slide and combine, translate, transform etc
20:49:05 <Keal> i try make program called Glyph to do it but my script lang called T too slow
20:49:12 <Keal> i invent T
20:49:38 <Keal> can GMP support KealDigit?
20:49:49 <Keal> i invent KealDigit
20:50:02 <monochrom> This is surreal
20:50:04 <Keal> % b*(Floor[v/b^p]/b-Floor[Floor[v/b^p]/b]) revolutionize math. and i come up with it on own/
20:50:09 <Keal> is KealDigit
20:50:17 <Cale> monochrom: hehe
20:50:39 <monochrom> I think you're banned from #math for revolution, not for ellipse.
20:50:47 <Keal> i call it KealDigit since it allow irrational base
20:51:04 <Keal> ok
20:51:14 <Cale> Keal: sometimes jokes don't come off the right way without the eyebrows.
20:51:32 <Keal> but it is indeed revolutionary. it expand concept of base counting system
20:51:48 <Keal> revolutions can be small too
20:52:20 <Keal> with KealDigit quantum crackproof encryption possible
20:52:34 <Keal> just one tool of many i have devised
20:53:20 <Cale> really man, these sorts of claims without justification are the sort of thing which gets you banned
20:54:08 <Keal> i come home find room destroyed all computers erased
20:54:26 <Keal> nsa is blocking my messages
20:54:31 <Keal> some not get thru
20:54:44 <Keal> :(
20:54:47 <monochrom> OK this is the next John Nash rising here.
20:54:51 <cjs> We are not blocking your messages.
20:54:59 <Keal> i know you arent
20:54:59 <cjs> Oops! I mean "they" are not blocking your messages.
20:55:14 <Cale> cjs: you've said too much!
20:55:19 <Keal> they have power to
20:55:36 <cjs> I can neither confirm nor deny that I may or may not have said too much.
20:55:39 <Keal> i doubt cgiirc glitch like that for specific phrases
20:56:01 <Keal> maybe i paranoid
20:56:10 <Keal> but someone did ransack my lab in 2003
20:56:17 <Cale> Keal: and a little delusional maybe?
20:56:31 <Keal> and took everything pentapulse related
20:56:54 <cjs> Maybe it's the NSA who broke into my computer and stole all of my monads.
20:57:06 <Keal> why not?
20:57:16 * cjs vainly tries to keep the channel even vaguely on topic....
20:57:21 <Keal> nsa has full right to take anything related to encryption
20:57:26 <Keal> in us
20:57:30 <Cale> Keal: Rather than entertaining people on IRC, you should just write a novel. :)
20:57:40 <Keal> :(
20:57:48 <Keal> you not beleive me :(
20:58:03 <Cale> You have to admit that it's a little far fetched
20:58:51 <Keal> i provide more formulas in future
20:58:55 <Keal> irc not working
20:59:06 <Keal> ok now works
20:59:15 <Keal> you shall see i speak truth
20:59:38 <Keal> i show how spell triangle in less than three corners using darkmanifold
20:59:57 <Cale> umm...
20:59:57 <musasabi> there is no truth, just different opinions and the victor decides which one is true.
21:00:08 <Keal> reversably
21:00:37 <Cale> Keal: If you'd like to teach yourself mathematics, I could recommend a book or two to start with
21:00:39 <Keal> KealDigit is single component that makes it work
21:00:43 * cjs wonders if there are "dark monads."
21:00:52 <Keal> in combo with other maths
21:01:07 <ncalexan> Cale: what would you recommend?
21:01:09 <Keal> i only research each item i need
21:01:17 <Cale> ncalexan: Spivak's Calculus
21:01:37 <cjs> Hey, duh! It just occurred to me, though probably it's already been thought of. We need a book called _The Little Haskeller_.
21:01:54 <Keal> for example representing a plane as a normal and a point
21:01:55 <cpatrick> cjs: 35% of the universe is secretly made up of dark monads, but astronomers conspire to keep it secret in case Haskellers find out and harness it to take over the world ;-)
21:02:00 <Cale> cjs: people have brought that up before, there may even be approximations to it now
21:02:17 <Keal> also raytracing using geometric algebra
21:02:43 <cjs> Hm. I'd be interested in seeing one. The Little Schemer got to the heart of about as quickly as it's possible to get, I think.
21:02:53 <twb> What's the function for printing again?  Something fooStrLn?
21:03:00 <cpatrick> putStrLn
21:03:04 <twb> Ah!
21:03:07 <Cale> Keal: seriously though, if you're interested, get Spivak's "Calculus" (which is a different book from "Calculus on Manifolds")
21:03:13 <twb> I always forget.
21:03:46 <monochrom> I think Keal is interested in teaching us mathematics.  I think I have some books on education to recommend...
21:03:48 <Keal> i have no money
21:03:56 <Keal> i in damn poor house
21:04:07 <cpatrick> I think it's called that so that people can try to claim haskell is just pascal with funny spelling
21:04:12 <Keal> all i own is laptop and stereo
21:04:33 <Keal> and two websites
21:04:38 <Cale> Keal: if there's a university nearby, their library will surely have it
21:05:12 <Keal> last time i went to university they ban me because i accidently on campus at night
21:05:24 <Keal> perhaps they forgot and i can return
21:05:40 <twb> Since when is it illegal to be on campus overnight?
21:05:43 <Keal> i got to university
21:05:55 <Keal> police said so
21:06:04 <twb> That's disgraceful.
21:06:06 <cpatrick> wtf!?
21:06:11 <musasabi> sounds weird
21:06:15 <Keal> they said campus closed at night
21:06:19 <twb> Unless you were doing something reprehensible, like urinating on people's cars.
21:06:21 <cpatrick> though some buildings you get kicked out of late at night
21:06:29 <twb> cpatrick: I hate that.
21:06:30 <musasabi> at least here there are many people every night on campus
21:06:35 <cpatrick> libraries do eventually close, etc
21:06:43 <twb> cpatrick: when the labs are closed from like 12pm to 6am
21:06:48 <musasabi> of course there are some places you are not supposed to be at.
21:06:50 <Keal> i had 2 dozen weapons cuz i was going to roleplay meet at house and took wrong turn
21:06:57 <Keal> -.-;
21:07:08 <twb> Keal: what, swords?
21:07:35 <monochrom> Oh we all know how accurately he describes why he's banned from #math.  I'm pretty sure he's also giving complete information concerning the circumstances of his being banned from the university.
21:07:49 <cpatrick> monochrom :-)
21:08:13 <Keal> 7ft riotchains, guarats, spike knuckles, shimmy, spiked shitkickers, etc
21:08:24 <twb> guarats = garrotes?
21:08:34 <ncalexan> Where might I get a pair of spiked shitkickers?
21:08:38 <Keal> wire to strangle with
21:08:41 <ncalexan> For that matter, what are said shitkickers?
21:08:43 <ncalexan> Shoes?
21:08:46 <ncalexan> Boots?
21:08:53 <Cale> heh
21:08:54 <ncalexan> Me, I've spent much time avoiding kicking shit.
21:08:55 <twb> Keal: that is normally spelt "garrote", because it's french.
21:09:10 <cpatrick> I can understand the police being a little concerned about someone carrying all that stuff about
21:09:11 <Keal> the garat was 70 feet long with counterweight to sling around sign and behead biker cop
21:09:13 <cpatrick> even in america
21:09:25 <ncalexan> #haskell takes a turn to the bizarre...
21:09:34 <twb> cpatrick: you mean, apart from police carrying it around :p
21:09:49 <Cale> bizarre and offtopic :)
21:09:51 <cpatrick> twb: yeah. state monopoly on violence and all that :-)
21:10:14 <Cale> It's always been bizarre, but usually does so without leaving the topic of Haskell.
21:10:14 <Keal> i made it myself :|
21:11:25 <twb> Hee hee: http://www.plt-scheme.org/who/common-plt-app.html
21:11:46 <Keal> also i had 2 box cutters
21:11:47 <Keal> :/
21:12:01 <palomer> lennart: you around?
21:12:17 <Keal> so thta why police not want me at asu
21:12:27 <ncalexan> Arizona State?
21:12:35 <palomer> hrm, it seems it's possible to do type inference without creating new names
21:12:37 <Keal> the 7ft industrial chain weiged 50lbs
21:12:38 <palomer> quite interesting
21:12:53 <palomer> using the ST monad
21:13:00 <Keal> anyways..
21:13:18 <Keal> yes Arizona State University
21:13:46 * ncalexan has another reason not to attend the Arizona Winter School in number theory ;)
21:14:12 <ncalexan> I can't dodge any garotte, misspelled or otherwise.
21:14:34 <twb> ncalexan: they don't move very fast ;-)
21:14:58 <ncalexan> Neither do I.
21:15:24 <Cale> palomer: hmm, neat
21:17:15 <Keal> apparently i am at a hiphop rave with now
21:17:30 <Keal> with mcmerv and electrosex
21:18:43 <Keal> and mcmerv just used my laptop as a keyboard to play mouthmusic
21:20:23 <Keal> and now he just used the phone to call up a drug deal
21:22:34 <Keal> hey cale
21:23:11 <Cale> Keal: hey, you're really offtopic here :)
21:23:17 <Keal> sorry :|
21:23:44 <Cale> it's not a big deal, but this channel is supposed to be about Haskell, you know?
21:23:54 <Cale> try #haskell-blah
21:23:54 <Keal> cale i have q
21:24:07 <Cale> which is like this, but about everything except Haskell
21:24:43 <Keal> how would i plot fractals using haskell
21:25:23 <dons> the usual way
21:26:12 <Cale> if you need a gui library, you might take a look at gtk2hs or wxHaskell -- you're not running linux or unix, so wxHaskell is probably easier to get working.
21:26:21 <nathan_> just curious, but what sort of fractals?
21:26:34 <Keal> not sure yet. trying to remember
21:26:38 <Keal> oh yes,,,,
21:26:39 <Keal> duh..
21:26:48 <Keal> recursed fractals
21:26:53 <nathan_> ahhh
21:26:55 <Cale> most of them are :)
21:27:02 <Keal> recursed as in fractals encoded within fractals
21:27:53 <nathan_> I think things like julia sets seem a lot more iterative than things like kock snowflake though
21:28:05 <Keal> it needs to be able to remotely control a laser mount
21:28:19 <Cale> ah, cool
21:28:57 <Keal> 1d fractals
21:29:20 <Keal> one dimensial
21:29:24 <Keal> five pulses
21:29:35 <Cale> So I suspect you'd rather just print commands to control the motors
21:29:37 <Keal> each pulse with a specific phase and amplitude
21:29:46 <Keal> needs to be analog
21:29:50 <Keal> no motor
21:30:05 <dons> Cale's ability to humour people boggles
21:30:08 <Keal> all is 5 pulses , phased and amplitude
21:30:43 <Keal> need to send a quantum crack proof  microburst to a reciever to decode it
21:30:46 <palomer> it does
21:31:09 <Cale> Keal: yeah, that last bit there was incomprehensible
21:31:24 <Keal> can haskell pipe the raw irrational megaequation into an analog device
21:31:26 <Cale> but I like the idea of controlling a laser pointer to draw fractals
21:31:45 <Keal> the fractal is 5 irrationals
21:31:50 <Cale> um
21:31:56 <Cale> that doesn't make sense either
21:32:00 <Cale> I'm afraid
21:32:08 * ncalexan is also afraid.
21:32:16 <palomer> fractals are the bastard children of calculus
21:32:19 <Cale> heh
21:32:23 <Cale> palomer: :)
21:32:27 <Keal> think back to my note about triangle corners
21:32:31 <palomer> and calculus is the bastard child of geometry
21:32:38 <Cale> You're with Poincar then
21:32:47 <Keal> 9 values represent a tirnalge in 3space corect?
21:32:48 <palomer> what did he say?
21:33:29 <Cale> palomer: let me find the quote
21:33:31 <ncalexan> Triangle.
21:33:32 <Keal> i break it down into one corner and 5 irrationals
21:33:53 * dons wishes for a `...' operator, similar to `undefined'
21:34:04 <Keal> then since those 5 irrationals all not completely filled i recurse the alogirhtm
21:34:23 <Keal> taking 9*8 and converting to 8*8
21:34:43 <Keal> and recurse until it is down to one corner and 5 pulses
21:34:52 <Keal> the corner is the key
21:34:56 <Cale> In the old days when people invented a new function they had something useful in mind. Now, they invent them deliberately just to invalidate our ancestors' reasoning, and that is all they are ever going to get out of them.
21:34:57 <palomer> undefined is an operator?
21:35:09 <Keal> the 5 pulses are the infinite volume archive
21:35:14 <Cale> That's the one :)
21:35:39 <musasabi> dons: I think that "_" as an value would make most sense.
21:35:53 <Keal> meaning since it is done that way it is quantum crack proof since the key is 3 irrationals spanning possiblity from inf to -inf each
21:35:54 <palomer> Cale: that's when the logicians were taking over?
21:36:02 <dons> Cale, yes. let's invalidate our forefathers' reasoning!
21:36:03 <Cale> palomer: analysts
21:36:05 <dons> onward ho!
21:36:17 <ncalexan> Cale: a refutation of the school of Weierstrass et al/
21:36:18 <Keal> and since its an infinite volume. you could send the contents of the universe in 5 pulses
21:36:20 <ncalexan> ?
21:36:31 <ncalexan> Keal: why 5?  Why not 4?
21:36:31 <palomer> here's something that bothers me:
21:36:43 <palomer> Pi is irrational, someone give me a physical manifestation of this
21:36:49 <Keal> because thats the way the math goes
21:36:52 <dons> i just notice that I actually type ... in my code when hacking. and then need to comment it out to type check.
21:37:11 <Keal> you can generate the keys using KealDigit
21:37:21 <Cale> ncalexan: yeah, I think Weierstrass would be part of that group which Poincar was talking about.
21:37:56 <Keal> you also untwine the encrption using KealDigit and algebraic simplifications of higher end calculus 
21:38:43 <dons> @type let (...) = undefined :: m a in do { [] ; (...) ; return 'x' }
21:38:45 <lambdabot> m a in do { [] ; (...) ; return 'x' } :: [Char]
21:38:55 <dons> but without '(' and ')'. 
21:38:56 <Keal> i dumped the long as hell equation for pentapulse into #math on efnet
21:39:06 <dons> what's the ellipsis function in Isabelle?
21:39:09 <dons> 'trust me'?
21:39:11 <dons> ah, 'hole'
21:39:44 <Keal> everyone was pissed and apparently so was the nsa and ever since asu has uncontrollably been flooding #math on efnet for some unknown reason and 2 days later my lab was ransacked
21:40:13 <palomer> ah yes, the good old days of efnet #math
21:41:16 <Keal> so i am working on reconstructing pentapulse
21:41:41 <cpatrick> Keal: why would the NSA be concerned if no-one but you can understand it?
21:42:15 <Keal> because it was the only opensource encryption scheme of such complexity
21:43:27 <Keal> when everyone has foolproof encryption for free and opnesource KryptosAG the national security agency's callboy goes belly up and the us no longer has taps on the world
21:45:05 <Keal> in a way its global terrorism
21:45:10 <Keal> my doings that is
21:45:15 <musasabi> Keal: this might be more believable if you would have had reliable offsite backups.
21:45:35 <Keal> i will provide the entire formula as soon as i can
21:45:49 <musasabi> because simple fire would have done the same.
21:46:24 <Keal> they took everything i had on it except asingle placard with a notation on it that looks like kitten scatch to everyone but me
21:46:41 <nathan_> I have a potentially stupid (maybe this is built in) Haskell question:
21:47:06 <nathan_> how would I apply a function (partially) to a list?
21:47:17 <Cale> partially?
21:47:26 <musasabi> map is not enough?
21:47:29 <Cale> > map (*2) [1,2,3,4,5]
21:47:31 <nathan_> like u f (x:xs) = u (f x) xs; u f [] = f
21:47:31 <lambdabot> [2,4,6,8,10]
21:47:39 <Keal> pentapulse is fool proof until darkspace is fully conquered in 22XX
21:47:43 <Cale> oh, just to the first element?
21:47:46 <nathan_> except that complains about infinite type, which makes sense
21:47:55 <nathan_> oops
21:48:00 <Keal> my estimated projection is 22XX
21:48:11 <Cale> also, the base case looks a bit off there
21:48:23 <nathan_> no, wait, I think it looks right (besides not type checking)
21:48:26 <musasabi> nathan_: what do you think the type of f should be?
21:48:27 <Keal> hrm me looks
21:48:56 <Keal> u is unsigned?
21:49:00 <Cale> Keal: you really ought to write a book :)
21:49:08 <nathan_> musasabi: I get an infinite type error and I think that makes sense
21:49:17 <monochrom> I am not comfortable with the requirement that f and (f x) are of the same type.
21:49:39 <Keal> Cale 99% of my book has been erased by faulty hdd's
21:49:39 <nathan_> yes, agreed, that is the problem with the function above
21:49:45 <cpatrick> nathan_: wouldn't f need to be of type a -> a -> a -> ... ?
21:49:54 <Keal> my book is called Sorrow's Eve
21:49:56 <cpatrick> yeah, what monochrom said
21:50:09 <Cale> > let u f (x:xs) = (f x : xs); u f [] = []; u (2*) [1,2,3,4,5]
21:50:10 <lambdabot>  parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
21:50:13 <Cale> > let u f (x:xs) = (f x : xs); u f [] = [] in u (2*) [1,2,3,4,5]
21:50:14 <lambdabot> [2,2,3,4,5]
21:50:26 <Cale> Is that the idea?
21:50:30 <monochrom> What would you like u f [1,2,3] to be?
21:50:43 <Keal> unless you know a damn trustworthy forensic magentic resonance engineer with shitloads of money those transcripts are long gone
21:50:46 <nathan_> yes, if (f x) is same type as f, then f has infinite type, so the above doesn't work
21:51:07 <nathan_> monochrom: u f [1,2,3] = f 1 2 3
21:51:21 <Cale> nathan_: ah, but what is the type of u?
21:51:26 <monochrom> Precisely my worry.  It is not going to be easy.
21:51:28 <Keal> and that engineer better have triplicate doctorates in decrypting chaos encryption
21:51:34 <nathan_> e.g. in lisp: (defun u (f l) (eval (cons f l)))
21:51:48 <Cale> nathan_: you can't write that in Haskell proper
21:51:49 <nathan_> (or could just use apply, but that isn't the point)
21:51:55 <Cale> you could make it a TH macro
21:52:06 <Keal> since that is pretty much happens when someone EMP's your lab
21:53:14 <musasabi> Keal: if you want security then learn what "secure offsite" means.
21:53:39 <nathan_> thanks, I will look at TH macro
21:54:31 <Keal> i do have a wacky theory about doing trig wihout pi
21:54:46 <Keal> last day i was in my lab i had a diagram which might have removed pi
21:55:11 <Cale> Keal: did you read the article which appeared on slashdot a while back about that kind of thing?
21:55:20 <Keal> link me
21:56:45 <Keal> involved something like refracting off an orbital focus
21:57:06 <Keal> within a geometric prism of some sort

21:58:16 <ncalexan> (Hopefully this is old)
21:58:37 <cpatrick> pfft, UNSW should have bandwidth anyway :-)
21:58:48 <Cale> http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/Chapter1.pdf
21:58:54 <dons> just get it from ^^
21:59:41 <Cale> The result isn't as effective as ordinary trig, but it doesn't depend directly on angles, which is good if you're teaching to people who haven't seen calculus yet.
21:59:42 <Keal> sorry bout that
21:59:51 <Keal> say again what i missed
21:59:59 <Cale> http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~norman/papers/Chapter1.pdf
22:00:20 <araujo> Hello!
22:00:27 <Cale> araujo: Hi!
22:01:15 <Cale> The usual problem with trigonometry is that in order to properly define angles, you generally need some notion of arclength, which requires some form of limiting process to define correctly.
22:01:24 <Keal> not found
22:01:29 <Keal> btw i am published
22:01:37 <Keal> however thru plagiarism
22:02:00 <Cale> and they usually teach trig *before* calculus, so it's a little backward.
22:02:07 <araujo> Cale, :-)
22:02:25 <Keal> someone published an article that was sold 30$ a pop about Damascus Widow, a theoretical offensive firewall i had been working on
22:03:17 <Cale> this guy worked out a way to accomplish some of the effects of trig without needing angles
22:03:22 <Keal> more to the pain, when i attempted to register my orgid (IGEN) a military company had spoofed it
22:03:41 <Keal> i own IGEN
22:04:08 <Keal> the nsa popped up a spoof company called IGEN International Inc
22:04:19 <Keal> which had its share of stock fraud
22:04:27 <Keal> it is now known as BioVeris
22:04:48 <Keal> my organization was Ideal Generation Technology Sect
22:04:54 <Keal> (IGEN)
22:06:22 <ncalexan> Cale: neat article, and nice presentation.
22:07:56 <Keal> it was an opensource copyleft  freeware competitor of KryptosAG, TGEN, BioVeris, etc
22:09:05 <Keal> it had the slogan 'the ideal should be bartered not compromised'
22:09:31 <Keal> or something to that effect
22:10:16 <Keal> the entire organization's site was on dynamic ip every 12 hours with no national location
22:10:48 <Keal> basically bounced around the entire net hopping half day intervals
22:11:09 <Cale> Keal: don't you get tired of this?
22:11:10 <Keal> that way the site could never be tore down
22:11:21 <Keal> not really just want to know how haskell can help
22:11:38 <Cale> haskell is just a programming language
22:11:40 <ncalexan> Keal: Haskell is not powerful enough for what you need to do.
22:11:59 <Keal> i only trust opensource tools
22:12:17 <cpatrick> and that's a nonsequitur
22:12:41 <cpatrick> probably not that wise if they _are_ out to get you, anyway ..
22:12:48 <Keal> hell i have an 8088 and a 4016 sitting around if need be
22:12:53 <Cale> It's a very expressive and cool programming language, but it's just a programming language, and has practically nothing to do with anything you're talking about.
22:13:02 <Keal> 8088 is in need of repair tho
22:13:35 <Keal> :/
22:14:31 <musasabi> opensource does not make all problems go away if you are running on closed hardware.
22:14:48 <musasabi> and even if both software and harware are open there might be hidden backdoors.
22:14:55 <Cale> musasabi: you read my mind
22:15:25 <musasabi> :-)
22:15:57 * Cale notes that the Free and Open Source Hardware movement seems to be going a lot slower than its cousin.
22:16:38 <cpatrick> Cale: hardware has a much higher cost to reproduce at the moment :-)
22:16:46 <Cale> cpatrick: yeah :)
22:16:59 <Keal> obviously you never heard of Tier
22:17:07 <Keal> its absurd
22:17:14 <Keal> but theoretically it would work
22:17:30 <musasabi> FPGA is one solution, but does not work for complex things.
22:17:34 <Keal> analog slice
22:17:47 <Keal> using nanobots
22:18:30 <cpatrick> at risk of getting back on topic, is there anything like gdb for haskell?
22:18:35 <Keal> i will provide the proof as soon as i repoduce it
22:18:43 <cpatrick> ghc has a -debug but can't figure out how to do anything with it or find any docs...
22:18:44 <Cale> cpatrick: there are things like hat
22:18:44 <ncalexan> cpatrick: there are some tools.  Hat was one.
22:18:54 * cpatrick googles for hat
22:18:59 <musasabi> http://www.haskell.org/hat/
22:19:00 <ncalexan> But I think all suffer from the bit rot.
22:19:12 <ncalexan> Fre{y,j}a was another?
22:19:29 <musasabi> Buddha is an another.
22:19:32 <Cale> cpatrick: and all the debuggers require you to program using only certain modules and no extensions
22:19:37 <cpatrick> hat has a May 2005 release, that doesn't sound too rotted
22:19:43 <cpatrick> Cale: that's a bugger :-(
22:19:55 <Keal> you need a Zh function in Haskell
22:19:57 <Cale> cpatrick: Haskell programmers don't write bugs :)
22:19:58 <cpatrick> so the debuggers are basically haskell interpreters/RTSes?
22:20:07 <cpatrick> Cale: this one does :-)
22:20:15 <Cale> cpatrick: no, they're more than that
22:20:37 <Cale> If you just want a repl, GHCi and Hugs are great
22:20:49 <Cale> I use GHCi for most of my debugging
22:21:14 <cpatrick> what I want is a stack trace showing function calls and arguments
22:21:17 <Keal> Zh is an operator that does * /   - elementally
22:21:21 <Cale> Hat is a collection of tools for tracing and visualising evaluation of expressions
22:21:26 <Keal> where did the   go?
22:21:32 <Keal> &&
22:21:32 <cpatrick> though I'm not sure if that even makes sense in the context of haskell
22:21:34 <Keal>   
22:21:37 <Keal> test  
22:21:51 <Keal> cgiirc cant do plus signs wtf
22:22:00 <Cale> Keal: Oh no! The NSA is censoring addition!
22:22:05 <Keal> ahah
22:22:11 <Keal> its prolly a glitch
22:22:33 <Keal> anyways i came up with a Contstant that is an operand
22:22:36 <Cale> cpatrick: stack traces are possible, but usually unhelpful
22:22:37 <Keal> constant
22:22:43 <Keal> called Zh
22:23:02 <cpatrick> Cale: ah :S
22:23:14 <Cale> cpatrick: they don't look anything like the stack traces you might get in a strict evaluated program
22:23:20 <Keal> it is the elementary operator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
22:23:32 <cpatrick> yeah, I can imagine that would be the case
22:23:46 <Keal> anyways it also performs such for irrationals
22:24:27 <Keal> since it uses the Keal Digit formula i call Tg
22:24:47 <Keal> anyways Zh and Tg work well in doing things calculus alone cannot
22:24:50 <Cale> Keal: this is totally off topic
22:25:13 <Cale> and there are people here trying to talk about Haskell, so please :)
22:25:13 <rep> every rose has its thorn
22:25:14 <Keal> and then i have Ss which works for boolean logic and venn permutations
22:25:15 <Keal> perfectly on topic
22:25:45 <Keal> i would like to add a Haskell module that does it
22:25:45 <Keal> i would like to add a Haskell module that does it
22:25:47 <Keal> i would like to add a Haskell module that does it
22:25:47 <Keal> test
22:25:51 <dons>  well, there's always /ignore
22:26:30 <Keal> goddamn latency
22:26:40 <Cale> yeah :/
22:27:05 <Keal> i would like to write some haskell modules
22:27:09 <dons> it's bad for this good channel to get thrown off topic by overly verbose trollers
22:28:23 <ncalexan> Who has ops?
22:28:42 <dons> shapr. don't know of anyone else.
22:29:11 <Keal> i would like to create a libary for haskell
22:29:32 <Keal> so other mathematicians may become familiar with my material
22:30:22 * lispy wants haskell on rails
22:30:35 <lispy> or curry on cables
22:30:51 <lispy> er...i dont' like the abbreviation for that one...
22:30:57 <Cale> curry is much better on rice
22:30:59 <ncalexan> he he.
22:31:09 <Keal> where can i download haskell for windows?
22:31:18 <lispy> Keal: at the ghc site
22:31:19 <gzl> haskell.org
22:31:48 <lispy> here is an example ruby on rails app i found, http://blackjax.codersbase.com
22:32:09 <lispy> but i can't shake the feeling that it would be more fun to write it in haskell
22:32:11 <Keal> brb
22:32:53 <dons> musasabi, loks like the evil fannkuch entry taken from the wiki has the wiki syntax highlighting bug in it, and is {-# OPTIONS -O2 -optc-O3 -fglasgow-exts #-} ?
22:33:00 <dons> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=fannkuch&lang=ghc&id=2
22:33:04 <Cale> lispy: why not just wish for good CGI, HTML and database libraries?
22:33:42 <lispy> Cale: isn't that what i said?
22:33:58 <lispy> is'n that what rails is? :)
22:34:08 <Cale> er, separately
22:34:34 <lispy> oh, well the nice thing about rails is that you just plug it in, and it generates the scaffolding and you start coding away
22:34:42 <Cale> does it have to be all mixed together with lots of flashy marketingspeak? :)
22:34:45 <Keal> Cale i will try to have to proofs for Zh and Ss for you as soon as possible :)
22:35:05 <lispy> Cale: there does not have to be a mention of web2.0 :)
22:35:06 <musasabi> dons: so it is simply missing {-# OPTIONS ... #-} ?
22:35:09 <dons> musasabi, here's a version without wiki gunk: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fannkuch.hs
22:35:23 <Cale> I want libraries which don't need scaffolding
22:35:24 <dons> musasabi, that. but also the syntax hl on the wiki inserted a bogus output line.
22:35:37 <musasabi> grah. "nice"
22:35:42 <musasabi> I'll use that version.
22:36:02 <Keal> test
22:36:47 <Keal> sorry
22:36:50 <lispy> Cale: well, the way i see it, the scaffolding sits in place until you get to the point of redefining it.  So you start witha working webapp and then evolve it into what you want
22:36:53 <Keal> accidnetly pressed stop
22:37:13 <Keal> can haskell compile flash animations and java apps?
22:37:17 <lispy> Cale: if done correctly that can speed up development time
22:37:19 <dons> I see the reverse-complement jumped 8 places, and is now only 13x slower. much better, considering it still used boxed IO
22:37:45 <Keal> ihave important questioon :(
22:37:55 <lispy> Keal: probably not in the way you mean it
22:37:56 <Keal> can haskell compile flash animations and java apps?
22:38:15 <Keal> but can it compile them and they work on whichever os?
22:38:20 <lispy> haskell is a language, "it" does nothing
22:38:26 <Cale> lispy: I'd rather have higher order functions and appropriate identity values to plug in which take care of that sort of thing :)
22:38:27 <Keal> :(
22:38:34 <Keal> there is no haskell compiler?
22:38:46 <gzl> of course there's a haskell compiler
22:38:53 <Keal> is there no flash or java haskell vm?
22:38:58 <lispy> Cale: in this case, I don't buy it until you give me a nice proof of your concept :)
22:39:32 <musasabi> regexdna looks like a problem.
22:39:33 <Keal> cuz if haskell can compile as a java applet or flash applet i need to know
22:39:52 <dons> yes, it needs packed IO. but also needs the faststring regex lib
22:39:55 <Cale> lispy: well, what kind of scaffolding are we talking about?
22:40:19 <Keal> i need to know!
22:40:19 <lispy> Keal: there is no haskell compiler that will compile java or flash because a haskell compiler compiles haskell not java or flash
22:40:22 <Keal> :((((
22:40:47 <lispy> Cale: in some cases it's example files you can edit, in other cases it's overloadable functions
22:40:52 <Keal> why cant haskell be compiled as a java or flash app ifnot what does it compile as?
22:41:10 <Keal> is there a haskell vm for browsers?
22:41:35 <lispy> Keal: ah, your asking a different question.  You're asking if the haskell compiler can produce an executable for the jvm or flash
22:41:40 <ncalexan> Can anyone point me to docs about declaring my own Typeable instances?
22:41:45 <Keal> yes
22:42:11 <lispy> Keal: there is F#.  It's not haskell (it's ocaml, similar but totally different)
22:42:17 <lispy> F# is for the .NET runtime
22:42:25 <Cale> ncalexan: you derive them
22:42:54 <Keal> i need math friendly compiler to compile for jvm or flash
22:43:06 <Keal> what is F#
22:43:23 <dons> hmm. musasabi, maybe I should write a faster k-nucleotide.
22:43:31 <lispy> Keal: read this http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tullsen/haskell-to-java.ps
22:44:00 <Keal> i dont know what a ps file is
22:44:07 <musasabi> dons: it should be quite easy to beat with a mutable solution.
22:44:17 <lispy> Keal: it's post script
22:44:18 <musasabi> dons: maybe even with strictness in the right place.
22:44:19 <dons> yeah, I see your comment.
22:44:36 <lispy> Keal: http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:qCUvB1r2od0J:www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tullsen/haskell-to-java.ps+haskell+to+jvm+translation&hl=en&client=firefox-a
22:44:40 <dons> ok, that'll be my next job. it doesn't seem to need anything too hard, like regexes
22:45:08 <musasabi> it is the shortest entry for the benchmark and still faster than ruby.
22:45:20 <dons> good good :)
22:45:46 <dons> where was that summary page that let you rank all the languages?
22:45:57 <dons> with the CRAP weighting algo.
22:46:04 <musasabi> I think that the second haskell entry will be killed (it is mutable, longer and slower than the functional one)
22:46:11 <lispy> musasabi: is ruby slower than perl?
22:46:39 <musasabi> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/ http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/
22:47:11 <dons> yeah, unfortunately Branimir doesn't seem to want to consult or use the wiki :/
22:48:49 <musasabi> lispy: depends.
22:49:52 <lispy> i wonder if ruby has a real gc reference counting
22:50:08 * lispy goes to look it up
22:50:39 <lispy> why do people call dynamically typed languages untyped?  is it just ignorance?  It strkes me as malice :)
22:51:35 <dons> do they? people don't say that, without being wrong.
22:51:40 <lispy> the first page i went to about ruby said it was untyped...
22:51:44 <musasabi> lispy: real GC.
22:52:01 <lispy> and a guy at work said lisp was untyped...i didn't want to quibble or i would have corrected him
22:52:04 <lispy> musasabi: nice
22:53:03 <Keal> that url made less sense to me than a kitten just suddenly exploding
22:53:35 <musasabi> dons: btw when writing new entries on the wiki, maintaining a "contributed by <list of names>" comment would make things easier.
22:53:52 <dons> ok. will do.
22:54:20 <Keal> does haskell normally compile or just interpret?
22:54:25 <lispy> Keal: ah, they talk about HaskellToJava that one of the authors wrote, but don't seem to provide a link
22:54:26 <musasabi> I can glean the names from the general text and wiki edit history, but if people write it themselves it will be in the form they like it.
22:54:34 <musasabi> (and I don't forget anyone)
22:54:47 <musasabi> Keal: both.
22:55:00 <lispy> Keal: haskell was meant to be compiled, but people came up with ways to interpret it.  so we have both now.
22:55:18 <musasabi> Keal: the largest implementation GHC supports both an interpreting repl and an optimizing native code compiler.
22:55:52 <dons> i'm happy as long as we rank higher than OCaml in the shootout :)
22:56:09 <musasabi> SML is the problem.
22:56:11 <dons> and by fixing up some of the IO entries, we'd sneak in just behind SML, I think.
22:56:25 <dons> yeah. we should talk to Simon & Simon about that.
22:56:33 <Keal> what is %foo 0 (/nl) %beta -242.2 (/nl) alias hello { return $calc($1   $2) } (/nl) format called
22:56:39 <Keal> mirc is similar to irc
22:56:42 <Keal> mirc is similar to it*
22:57:28 <Keal> Cale! :(
22:58:16 <lispy> dons: now that i heard Marlow say there is a bug in ghc GCer I want someone to fix that :)
22:58:18 <Keal> lispy what is the name of the scripting notation that mirc script is modelled after
22:58:36 <Keal> hurry i have 3 minutes before i must leave!
22:58:38 <Keal> :(
22:58:44 <lispy> Keal: i have no idea
22:58:51 <Keal> :(((
22:58:52 <lispy> Keal: google it :)
22:58:55 <dons> ah, happily ghc now comes 5th (by 1.1x) in the memory usage in rev-comp, better than it's former position of last.
22:59:07 <lispy> Keal: and learn some netique while you're at it
23:00:14 <Cale> 'Netique' is a cool typo. It's like either a masculine form of 'netiquette' or a portmanteau of 'net' and 'boutique'
23:00:33 <lispy> hehe, or it's just that i thought that's how i should spell it :)
23:00:47 <musasabi> I think that we should beat SML in loc, not just CPU/memory.
23:00:51 <lispy> but, yeah i really botched it
23:00:57 <sieni> loc?
23:01:02 <lispy> lines of code
23:01:02 <sieni> lines of code?
23:01:04 <sieni> ahh
23:01:43 <lispy> netiquette.../me tries to commit that one to long term storage
23:02:25 * sieni received his copies of TaPL and ATTaPL today
23:02:42 <Keal> what is the name of a major scripting language similar to mirc script?
23:02:54 <Keal> me leave in 1 minute
23:04:45 <Keal> i go home now
23:05:10 <Keal> i talk when i get home
23:05:16 <Keal> cya
23:06:40 <lispy> <rant> god, lilo annoys me with all the anti spam bot measures and the frequent server reboots</rant>
23:06:52 <lispy> sorry, had to went
23:06:53 <lispy> er vent
23:49:09 <Keal> Cale
23:49:14 <Keal> i am home now
23:49:30 <Keal> do i have permission to let you all in on a little secret?
23:50:16 <Keal> i am supposed to be dead according to the nsa
23:50:37 <Keal> the nsa's main job is to preserve the timeline
23:50:47 <Keal> yes
23:51:01 <Keal> that is their main job
23:51:35 <Keal> to prevent the timeline from diverging
23:52:01 <Keal> that is pretty much the National Security Agency's major focus
23:52:35 <Keal> one divergence is that i am alive now. rather than have died in 1997
23:52:57 <Keal> i was supposed to have died thru suicide
23:53:09 <Keal> however i commit suicide. but lived.
23:53:20 <Keal> due to a divergence in the timeline.
23:53:46 <Keal> stop me at any time if you would rather get back on topic.
23:53:59 <Keal> the nsa has tried to kill me numerous times
23:54:26 <Keal> once an assassin attempted to bump me into an intersection of oncoming cars
23:55:08 <Keal> another time the same assassin stopped in front of me on the freeway then sped off when the car i was a passenger in banapeeled by the truck that hit me
23:55:23 <Keal> another time a light was changed to green in both directions
23:55:41 <Keal> but only while i was passing thru the intersection
23:57:29 <Keal> or it could have been i was supposed to have died in 2000 when i went thru a green and a car tboned me. i experienced 15 seconds or so of static and a loud rrrrrchchhchch sound then suddenly the timeline diverged and i was alive again, sitting at a green light with the car zooming thru the red
23:57:52 <Keal> i have experienced what it is like to not exist after death
23:58:03 <Keal> and then i remembed it when my death unhappened
23:58:14 <Keal> you are prolly wondering what this has to do with Haskell
23:59:00 <Keal> well not much. since Cale etc already pointed out Haskell is puny to nothing to emulate this using my barrage of mathematic theories
