00:45:05 <lome> where is lambdabot?
00:52:15 <kzm> I was wondering about the H' label proposal.  Anything against using ' instead of # to signify labels?
00:52:26 <kzm> I.e. 'label instead of #label
00:54:46 <dcoutts> kzm, it reminds people of lisp
00:57:15 <wilx> ' is almost invisible
01:02:54 <sieni> lisp <3
01:19:24 <Cale> kzm: It's sort of odd to use ' for labels as well as chars, though I suppose it's not ambiguous
01:19:52 <Cale> I kind of like #
01:21:52 <int-e> hmm, is 'a' a char or a label with type 'A'?
01:42:31 <vincenz> Anyone use "dia"?
01:42:50 <flux__> I've used it on occasion
01:43:07 <flux__> however most of my diagrams I've drawn with tcm; it has its gripes too, though
01:43:15 <vincenz> know any reasaon why it might suddenly take 100% cpu for like a minute or two when scaling a few simple objects
01:43:25 <flux__> maybe it has a bug?-)
01:43:26 <vincenz> and why it might be very slow in general when using layers
01:43:44 <vincenz> my diagram ain't that complex
01:43:53 <vincenz> it's just a few small boxes arrows and texts with some stuff
01:52:42 <vincenz> lol... it's apparently slower when the objects are big...but if I resize everything to fit in a page it's fine... odd really cause they're all just vectors
02:07:15 <gour> vincenz: have you tried inkscape?
02:07:22 <vincenz> gour: no I have not
02:07:33 <tibbe> @quote
02:07:41 <gour> vincenz: it creates svg & you can even export to latex (pstricks)
02:08:36 <vincenz> I'll try it
02:08:45 <vincenz> tx
02:12:24 <vincenz> how do I quickly change all fonts to one font
02:16:11 <vincenz> gour: inkscape is rather sucky...
02:16:16 <vincenz> gour: no way to draw simple shapes
02:16:18 <vincenz> like arrows
02:17:57 <xerox_> Sure there is
02:18:14 <xerox_> You just have to fiddle with paths for a lil while :-)
02:18:21 <vincenz> yeah well
02:18:25 <vincenz> I just need something simple and quick
02:18:53 <xerox_> Try to stroke one out, is not that difficult, in fact.
02:19:08 <vincenz> that's not hte point
02:19:11 <vincenz> I don't want to spend time making it pretty
02:19:18 <vincenz> I'm trying to do some thinking
02:19:26 <vincenz> so I want it quick, responsive and not a lot of hassle for simple stuff
02:20:35 <gour> ..then dia is (probably) better
02:20:54 <vincenz> yea but for some reason it consumes 100% cpu
02:20:58 <vincenz> when doing nothing
02:20:58 <gour> in inkscape you draw a line and then create end-markers
02:21:00 <vincenz> and it's seriously slow
02:21:18 <vincenz> odd, now that objects are not scaled, it's not slow
02:22:21 * vincenz darcs reverted
02:54:48 <shapr`> yow
02:54:51 <shapr`> @ow
02:54:53 <vincenz> 2yo
02:54:57 <vincenz> @yow
02:55:04 <vincenz> oh yeah
02:55:14 <shapr> no lambdabot
02:55:41 <vincenz> how do you tell lambdabot to join a channel?
02:55:47 <shapr> @join #channel
02:56:08 <vincenz> @yow
02:56:08 <oasisbot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
02:56:18 <shapr> @join #haskell-blah
02:56:19 <oasisbot> Not enough privileges
02:56:21 <shapr> doh
02:56:34 <shapr> That's amusing, since I wrote that code myself :-)
02:56:35 <vincenz> @join #haskell-blah
02:57:51 <shapr> I wonder if anyone got around to extending that to match hostnames etc
03:16:01 <Lemmih> dcoutts: ping.
03:23:47 <dons> hmm, I'm getting a weird msg: connect: does not exist (Connection refused) from lambdabot
03:28:09 <vincenz> dons: typoed the servername
03:28:34 <vincenz> ?
03:29:26 <dons> yeah, I tried that. seems valid according to the freenode page. and lambdabot connected before - i didn't change anything.
03:59:16 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, pong
04:03:01 <lome> where is lambdabot?
04:12:59 <shapr> hiding
04:14:04 <lome> it's pity.
04:18:15 <Lemmih> dcoutts_: How do you imagine plugins should add browser-views?
04:18:59 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, you mean hoe are they registered?
04:19:15 <Lemmih> dcoutts_: And do you have any ideas how to display a PackageDescription neatly?
04:19:54 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, so currently the thing just picks one browser view for a whole uri type
04:20:00 <dcoutts_> that's not going to be good enought
04:20:24 <dcoutts_> we'll need to be able to have multiple browsers veiws for each type of file/uri
04:20:43 <dcoutts_> and then probably a priority system or something
04:20:54 <dcoutts_> what we want in the end is:
04:20:59 <Lemmih> Right now I just want a Projects tab for viewing Cabal projects.
04:21:12 <dcoutts_> oh right
04:21:24 <dcoutts_> then yes you need a new browser view
04:21:38 <dcoutts_> see how the file browser registers itself
04:22:16 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, so the projects browser will map to file uris I expect
04:22:33 <dcoutts_> and the package descrition editor view will be used to display them
04:22:33 <Lemmih> I know how they register them self. It's impossible for plugins to register new browser views.
04:22:50 <Lemmih> Some redesigning is necessary.
04:23:00 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, well whatever thing the file borwser uses to register itself needs to be exported
04:23:02 <Lemmih> I was wondering if you had some ideas.
04:23:11 <dcoutts_> let me go look at the code
04:23:20 <dcoutts_> I may have just hacked that bit together
04:23:58 <Lemmih> dcoutts_: To add a browser view one needs to have access to the MainWindows.
04:24:30 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, right
04:24:42 <dcoutts_> MainWindow.addBrowserView mainWindow (...)
04:25:23 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, ah I see you point
04:25:37 <dcoutts_> because that adds it to a *specific* window
04:25:59 <dcoutts_> we want it register it so it's just *availalbe* for all new main windows
04:26:07 <dcoutts_> or something like that
04:26:20 <dcoutts_> so we need another registry
04:26:28 <dcoutts_> this seems to be a recurring pattern
04:27:20 <dcoutts_> then when we make a new window we just add all the regietered browser views that are currently registered
04:27:20 <Lemmih> So we need a global register of functions (MainWindow -> IO ()). Then we can call them whenever a new MainWindow is created, and whenever a new function is added the function gets called on all MainWindows.
04:27:49 <dcoutts_> since this is a recurring pattern we probably want a registry abstraction
04:27:56 <dcoutts_> where you can add/remove the things
04:28:18 <dcoutts_> and other bits can be notified of entries being added/removed
04:30:48 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, I guess it'll be like the PageRegistry but for browser views
04:32:06 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, I wonder sometimes if it might be possible to do this stuff by passing an "application instance" to each plugin's main function and if this would allow us to avoid having global registries using global var hacks.
04:33:32 <Lemmih> We can do quite a lot. We got the entire force of GHC's bytecode generator and typechecker behind us.
04:34:45 <Lemmih> If you design it then I'll hack it.
04:38:08 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, if you've got some time, would you mind thinking about a more flexible system for registering editor views
04:38:35 <dcoutts_> we need to be able to have multiple editors for a single uri
04:38:43 <dcoutts_> and then a way of picking between them
04:38:53 <dcoutts_> we'd default to the most specific editor
04:39:17 <dcoutts_> but the user could choose to use another one
04:39:38 <dcoutts_> eg you can edit a .cabal file with either a text editor or a nice custom gui
04:40:11 <dcoutts_> and you can have a darcs view of any darcs-managed file
04:40:14 <Lemmih> Other design issues and administration is already taking a lot of my time /-:
04:40:18 <dcoutts_> ok, np
04:40:24 <dcoutts_> I'll get to it eventually
04:41:23 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, yeah, sorry, the tree view stuff in gtk2hs is still taking a lot of my time
04:41:37 <dcoutts_> and I need that to do the file browser view properly
04:42:03 <dcoutts_> to make it scale and to make it a "live" view of the file system
04:48:17 <jethr0> i've got a darcs question...
04:48:58 <jethr0> i've applied a patch into my local repository using "apply". but now i'd like to see the results of this patch in my local working files. how's that supposed to work?
04:51:51 <kosmikus> let me repeat a previous request
04:51:59 <kosmikus> lhs2TeX users: I've uploaded a release candidate for lhs2tex-1.11 to http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~loeh/lhs2tex/inde
04:52:07 <kosmikus> sorry, broken url
04:52:21 <kosmikus> http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~loeh/lhs2tex/index.html
05:05:47 <shapr> jethr0: It should show up?
05:06:07 <jethr0> shapr: ?
05:06:18 <shapr> darcs apply should apply the patch to your working files.
05:06:35 <jethr0> i thought apply would add the patch to the repository only
05:06:37 <shapr> Unless you mean you have a separate working repo?
05:06:42 <jethr0> or wasn't i looking straight? :)
05:07:05 <shapr> If you have two repos (which is very sensible, and how I do things) then you can pull from the repo that has the pach.
05:07:06 <shapr> patch
05:07:11 * shapr didn't get enough sleep
05:07:23 <jethr0> i know. i was just wondering if there was a way with only one repo
05:07:33 <jethr0> (apart from the fact that i'm going to switch to two...)
05:07:35 <shapr> darcs apply does that
05:07:43 <jethr0> weird. i'll check again
05:08:25 <shapr> Or maybe I'm just missing lots of sleep and so confused about question or answer.
05:09:00 <shapr> Lemmih: Do you know if there's anything on ScannedInAvian that hasn't been moved?
05:13:18 <vincenz> jethr0: hiya
05:13:24 <jethr0> hey vincenz
05:14:12 <vincenz> jethr0: what do you use for your webserver? apache or lighttpd?
05:14:18 <jethr0> i'm nearly went crazy trying to implement my ABSearch. turn out that trying to add all premature optimizations before even understanding the algorithm has detrimental effect on implementation speed :)
05:14:24 <jethr0> apache
05:14:39 <int-e> heh
05:15:21 <jethr0> vincenz: i'm still not registered, sorry
05:15:45 <shapr> jethr0: first make it work, then make it work fast :-)
05:15:54 <SimonRC> yup
05:16:01 <SimonRC> Profilers are your friend.
05:16:07 <jethr0> shapr: thx. i knew that. but every once in a while i get cocky :)
05:16:32 <jethr0> it wasn't even speedup things i did. just making it unbelievably complex very early
05:16:33 <vincenz> darcs has a bug... if it cant' connect it hangs
05:16:41 <SimonRC> for how long?
05:16:48 <vincenz> indefinitely
05:16:49 <vincenz> ?
05:16:58 <vincenz> and acn't kill it
05:17:01 <vincenz> gotta kill -9 it
05:17:11 <shapr> Actually, I tend to totally skip fast and first make it work and then make it easy to understand.
05:19:16 <shapr> marcellus: Is there an active Haskell community at umea?
05:19:29 <shapr> urf, in umea... Swedish is confusing my English.
05:20:34 <fatbrain> shapr: should be, don't ya'll have haskell as *first-choice* for funktional programming?
05:22:01 <Lemmih> shapr: I've moved hIDE, yi and everything under /~lemmih.
05:22:53 <shapr> Well, chalmers and a few other universities have Haskell as the first language... But I spoke to a bunch of IT ppl who were Lulea University graduates working at Lulea Uni, and they still didn't know why they'd been forced to learn Haskell.
05:23:54 <shapr> Lemmih: ScannedInAvian is going down entirely, to be restored as a virtual server with significantly less bandwidth. If I end up with spare bandwidth after that, I'll restore the previous accounts, but otherwise it's all going down.
05:23:56 <fatbrain> shapr: It's not like you have to have a reason to learn a computer programming language, it's just to get a feel for functional programming, not like you have to write all your business logic in it.
05:24:33 <shapr> fatbrain: Sure, but when I spoke to these guys they said "That language only has lists and you can't change variables, what good is that?!"
05:25:04 <Lemmih> shapr: It was great while it lasted. Thanks.
05:25:07 <shapr> :-)
05:25:34 <shapr> Sadly, I ran out of spare money to continue supporting the #haskell and Haskell community.
05:26:13 <shapr> Now I have to email all the current account holders and tell them the server is disappearing, probably at the end of this month.
05:26:39 <fatbrain> shapr: what server would that be?
05:27:02 <jethr0> anyone in here worked with neural nets?
05:27:24 <aleator> jethr0: little bit..
05:27:32 <shapr> fatbrain: ScannedInAvian.{org,com,net} which has hosted a large amount of Haskell related stuff.
05:28:20 <fatbrain> oh, I see.
05:28:35 <shapr> boegel: Hey, ScannedInAvian is going down, you need to get your stuff off before the end of the month if you want a copy.
05:28:44 <shapr> Philippa: ScannedInAvian is going down, you need to get your stuff off before the end of the month if you want a copy.
05:29:12 <shapr> pesco: ScannedInAvian is going down, you need to get your stuff off before the end of the month if you want a copy.
05:29:19 <vincenz> shapr: isn't it easier to do
05:29:20 <jethr0> aleator: in haskell?
05:29:25 <vincenz> boegle, Philippa, pesco: ....
05:29:37 <shapr> depends on their irc client

05:30:46 <shapr> dons, dcoutts_, Lunar^, metaperl: ScannedInAvian is going down, you need to get your stuff off before the end of the month if you want a copy.
05:30:50 <davidhouse> shapr, what's ScannedInAvian?
05:31:12 <shapr> It's my personal server, and has hosted lots of Haskell-related stuff for several years.
05:31:14 <dcoutts_> shapr, thanks. I think we've got everything off now.
05:31:34 <shapr> Cute stuff like http://www.scannedinavian.org/iohcc/
05:32:20 <dcoutts_> shapr, thanks for hosting the stuff for so long!
05:32:23 <shapr> :-)
05:32:47 <dcoutts_> new we can get galois to pay the bandwidth bills :-)
05:32:59 <shapr> Yeah, and I know they can afford it better than I.
05:33:01 <dcoutts_> new/now
05:33:06 <dcoutts_> poor shapr 
05:33:12 <aleator> jethr0: With haskell (Ie. binding for a library)
05:33:18 <shapr> dcoutts_: I won't starve ;-)
05:33:39 <boegel|home> shapr: oh, how come ?
05:33:51 <tic_> shapr, why's it going down?
05:33:52 <dcoutts_> "starving Haskell hacker - will craft beatutiful functional code for cash"
05:33:59 <shapr> dcoutts_: heck yeah
05:34:32 <shapr> The only Haskell jobs I've found require me to relocate to the USA, and I'm not willing to do that.
05:34:36 <jethr0> aleator: you still have any code i could see? more specifically i'm looking for "trivial" guided examples of neural nets...
05:34:56 <boegel|home> shapr: how're things at uni ?
05:34:56 <dcoutts_> shapr, we need a Eurpoean Haskell consultency outfit
05:35:42 <boegel|home> shapr: you're sure thing will stay up until the _end_ of February ?
05:36:08 <shapr> boegel|home, tic_: Lack of cash on my part. The partnership comany I was in dissolved when I broke off my six year relationship, and now I can't afford to pay colo.
05:36:19 <shapr> boegel|home: No, I'm not sure it'll be up till then, but it's likely.
05:37:08 <boegel|home> shapr: hmm, okay, I'll move it as soon as I can
05:37:12 <shapr> awright
05:37:18 <boegel|home> shapr: thanks for the warning
05:37:28 <tic_> shapr, ouch. what's the backend written in?
05:37:48 <shapr> dcoutts_: Truly, I'd like to have a EuroHaskell consultancy group.
05:37:59 <shapr> tic_: backend?
05:38:12 <tic_> shapr, i.e. the web site. static HTML, HSP, PHP?
05:38:32 <dcoutts_> shapr, when I've finnished my PhD I'd love to do a bit of Haskell consultancy on the side of an academic job :-)
05:38:40 <shapr> ScannedInAvian.org uses Halipeto (haskell) ScannedInAvian.com uses PLog (Haskell) webwitches.com uses Plone (Python)
05:38:51 <tic_> Ah.
05:38:58 <boegel|home> dcoutts_: you're planning to go academic ? cool ! :)
05:39:05 <tic_> Okay, otherwise I'd have a place to host it...
05:39:32 <dcoutts_> boegel|home, well if I actually finnish my PhD and find a post-doc position :-)
05:40:33 <shapr> tic_: I'll have hosting since I'll be switching to a virtual server. It costs much less, but also has less bandwidth. I may be able to return to Haskell project hosting, but I can't be sure right now.
05:41:01 <boegel|home> I starting to think that's an interesting option...but it's not for now, I've just started
05:41:24 <tic_> shapr, Ah, okay. See, I have 2.5TB bandwidth and tens of gigs of storage. But it doesn't offer very much in terms of features. PHP4,5, RoR, MySQL, shell, ftp.
05:41:37 <shapr> Wow, lotsa bandwidth.
05:41:40 <tic_> mhm
05:42:01 <tic_> shapr http://www.dreamhost.com/shared/comparison.html <-- level 4 / strictly business
05:42:05 <shapr> I'm still convinced I can do more with Haskell than other systems, so I need root access to be able to setup Flippi, darcs, etc.
05:42:10 <tic_> Yeah.
05:42:16 <tic_> No root. Debian system, though.
05:43:19 <shapr> tic_: Here's what I'm planning to use - http://www.tektonic.net/vds.php?op=budget_plans
05:44:48 <tic_> shapr, ohh, that's not bad.
05:44:58 <tic_> shapr, the UM1?
05:45:06 <tic_> shapr, I only pay $10 for my Level4 account though. :)
05:45:34 <shapr> Yeah, but no root, so no Haskell server software.
05:45:59 <tic_> Mhm.
05:48:41 <aleator> jethr0: Well.. I think I've got libFANN wrapper around here somewhere, but it ain't really pretty. Most things I've done with it won' work without also the opencv wrapper i made (which is real ugly).
05:49:09 <aleator> jethr0: Also my examples are using pictures instead of simpler things.
05:51:03 <jethr0> aleator: :)
05:51:19 <jethr0> i'm looking for a simple hands on example (like recognition simple patterns).
05:51:38 <jethr0> but my google skills are failing me again :(
05:51:55 <aleator> jethr0: Are you interested in building a nn or using it?
05:51:59 <shapr> jethr0: Look for a character recognition backprop example.
05:54:33 <jethr0> aleator: building it, i guess. although the distinction is unclear to me. i certainly don't want to use a black-box net for some application, but rather find weights for a "standard" net to solve a problem
05:54:37 <jethr0> shapr: k
05:55:14 <shapr> jethr0: I learned ANNs from a book that used characters built from an array of 8x10 pixels, connected each pixel to an input, and used backprop to propagate the error, and ... least mean squares maybe? to get the neurons to recognize new data without losing the old learning.
05:55:33 <aleator> jethr0: I meant, that well, like I use support vector machines. I couldn't program one but I use it for many things.
05:56:12 <jethr0> aleator: cool. what are you using SVMs for?
05:57:02 <jethr0> shapr: hmm, maybe i should get a book from the library...
05:57:07 <aleator> jethr0: Well.. Fooling around. done some simple things like texture classification, CBIR even basic handwriting recognition..
05:57:17 <aleator> With various stages of success.
05:57:34 <shapr> Neural networks aren't that much more complicated than bayesian statistics. The cool part came from Kohonen's(?) discovery of how to ge error propagated through the hidden layers.
05:57:47 <jethr0> aleator: would you say that sensible domains of SVMs and ANNs are comparable?
05:57:54 <shapr> aleator: You could write nifty neural network monads...
05:58:21 <jethr0> shapr: as with all things inherently simple but somehow complex this will take me a while :)
05:58:26 <aleator> Probably. (Hope you excuse me for a while. I must change computers)
05:58:35 * shapr considers neural network arrows that shortcut calculation if the value is below the threshold.
05:59:03 <shapr> jethr0: Took me awhile too... I've just had a few years more to learn stuff :-)
05:59:04 <jethr0> what i really like is temporal difference learning with ANNs (see TD-Gammon). but to even approach that i'll have to work on some simpler binary classification examples, i think
05:59:33 <jethr0> shapr: i think you're younger than me...
05:59:44 <shapr> I seriously doubt that, but it's possible...
05:59:57 <jethr0> i'm 26
06:00:01 <shapr> I'm 34.
06:00:21 <jethr0> ah, you looked younger on your unicycle photo *g*
06:00:33 <shapr> I was 33 in that photo.
06:00:45 <shapr> Most people think I'm in my mid-twenties for whatever reason.
06:00:56 <jethr0> ok, so hopefully i'll have grasped ANNs in 8 years time :)
06:01:02 <jethr0> must be the long hair
06:01:46 <shapr> Or maybe that I rarely drink and only smoked for eight years.
06:01:52 * shapr dunno
06:02:30 <shapr> Could even just be that my attitude shows through.
06:03:40 <shapr> jethr0: but you do have a PhD, sometimes I'd trade my many years of learning nifty stuff for a piece of paper that would get me more easily employed.
06:04:26 <edwinb> You don't want a piece of paper with 'PhD' written on it then...
06:04:47 <jethr0> shapr: i don't have a phd
06:05:17 <shapr> Hm.. maybe I found someone else with your name in my google stalking...
06:05:21 <jethr0> and as far as i know (in europe) PhDs have no better chances of employment...
06:05:29 <jethr0> you stalker
06:05:33 * shapr grins
06:05:39 <shapr> Interesting people demand investigation.
06:05:45 <jethr0> i seriously doubt there's someone with my name and a phd
06:06:21 <shapr> Well, maybe I'm just confused.
06:06:29 <shapr> I'll have to reinvestigate later...
06:06:43 <edwinb> In the UK, employers seem to either ignore PhDs or regard you as overqualified...

06:24:08 <chrisbrown> jonkri: sorry thought you said GET nth element...
06:24:52 <jonkri> chrisbrown: no problem :-)
06:25:13 <chrisbrown> could you not use take and drop?
06:25:38 <jonkri> i don't see how. i have no unique elements to base it on
06:26:17 <chrisbrown> you need to set nth element in a list?
06:26:39 <jonkri> yes
06:28:00 <chrisbrown> i cant see anything in the api - but you can construct it using splitAt
06:28:13 <jonkri> yes, that's a good idea
06:28:36 <chrisbrown> something like...
06:28:48 <jonkri> thanks a lot
06:29:49 <chrisbrown> changeNth i new list = beg ++ [new] ++ end where (x,y) = splitAt i list; beg = head x; end = tail y
06:35:35 <jonkri> how can i turn my list of n elements into a m x o list where m*o=n?
06:35:56 <chrisbrown> i dont understand
06:36:31 <jonkri> i have a list of say, 16 elements. i want to have a list of 4 lists with 4 elements each
06:36:51 <chrisbrown> so you want to divide it up equally?
06:36:55 <jonkri> and this new list, concatted, will be this initial list with 16 elements
06:37:02 <jonkri> well, it could be a 2 x 8 list as wlel
06:37:20 <jonkri> i want to be able to decide that
06:37:26 <chrisbrown> you would use take

06:39:12 <jonkri> so i will have to define a recursive function that does that?
06:39:21 <chrisbrown> possibly
06:39:24 <jonkri> there isn't just a invers something to concat?
06:39:33 <chrisbrown> sorry?
06:39:36 <jonkri> haha
06:39:47 <jonkri> like, concat(arcconcat(x)) = x

07:01:20 <chrisbrown> > concat ((\a b ->[a, b]) [1,2,3] [4,5,6])
07:01:21 <oasisbot> [1,2,3,4,5,6]
07:01:55 <shapr> I'd do exactly that, I'd use a monad or arrow to 'concatenate' the neuron results according to the threshold or training function, or maybe both.
07:02:18 <shapr> Arrows would get you a bit more, since you could exploit Yampa to get reactive behaviour.
07:02:50 <chrisbrown> oh... unzip will do it....
07:03:03 <chrisbrown> > unzip [([1,2,3], [4,5,6])]
07:03:04 <oasisbot> ([[1,2,3]],[[4,5,6]])
07:03:12 <chrisbrown> kind of :/
07:03:15 <aleator_> I see relevance in that you could easily hang things on the end of the networks.. But where would this be useful?
07:05:25 <shapr> Arrows and monads themselves are just abstractions than can factor out common behaviour into a single place. The backprop ANNs I've studied have about four pieces, input, output, weight, and threshold. I'd probably abstract the training and classification pipelins into their own monad or arrow, and I might turn the neuron itself into an arrow type to get the benefit of shortcut evaluation.
07:05:36 * shapr thinks...
07:05:53 <shapr> Actually, Yampa's signal functions would work nicely for this.
07:06:29 <jethr0> shapr: sounds interesting. when i've grasped ANNs i'll maybe try to implement this
07:06:35 <shapr> Each network could be a collection arrow...
07:06:57 <jonkri> (\a b -> [a, b]) does it
07:07:02 <shapr> Each layer would probably be another collection inside that...
07:07:24 * shapr wonders how to associate weights to incoming connections...
07:08:07 <jethr0> there are n*m weights for n=|layer1|, m=|layer2|, right?
07:08:20 <shapr> yup
07:11:26 <shapr> jethr0: Are you working on a PhD?
07:11:36 <jethr0> shapr: nah, just personal interest
07:12:06 <jethr0> in theory i have to learn for cryptology, but instead i'm working on my CS/AI basics...
07:12:10 <shapr> Are you a commercially employed programmer like myself?
07:12:19 <shapr> Oh, what sort of crypto?
07:12:30 <jethr0> no, but i'll have to be in a few weeks time, when i finish my studies
07:12:34 * shapr has been meaning to read up on Elliptic Curve crypto...
07:13:01 <jethr0> general crypto exam for my master. symmetric, assymetric, hashes, shift registers, ...
07:13:06 <shapr> I have experience with ASN.1, X.509, RFC3161, etc
07:13:21 <shapr> Hm, sounds like fun.
07:13:37 <jethr0> shapr: so where in the states would you have found employment as a haskell developer?
07:13:43 <shapr> Have you read Applied Crypto by schneier?
07:14:33 <shapr> jethr0: There are several options, galois.com is the most interesting for a variety of reasons, aetion.com is another option, and there are a few gov't Haskell jobs that are limited to US Citizens.
07:14:34 <jethr0> shapr: yes, but i didn't like it. to pragmatic. i've got another book though i liked much better. "Menezes, Oorshot. Applied Cryptography"
07:14:45 <shapr> Haven't tried that one.
07:14:46 <jethr0> hmm, but they all seem like very small shops
07:15:06 <shapr> Once I learned about Merkle's Puzzles the rest of the book was just refinement.
07:15:16 <jethr0> :)
07:15:36 <shapr> Merkle's puzzles sure were a lightning strike of realization though.
07:15:50 <jethr0> i haven't gotten to those yet
07:16:02 <shapr> It's in the beginning of Schneier's AC.
07:16:09 <shapr> Probably on wikipedia... 
07:16:10 * shapr looks
07:16:39 <shapr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle's_puzzles
07:16:48 <jethr0> i've got this feeling that wikipedia is getting more and more pervasive. their articles tend to come up in google more and more on top. quite amazing
07:17:01 <shapr> Sort of like Linux, OSS, etc...
07:17:03 <jethr0> and more often helpful than not
07:17:24 <jethr0> ah, now i remember the puzzles
07:17:40 <shapr> I suspect Microsoft already knows they're a dinosaur.
07:18:31 <jethr0> well, by adapting a monopolist can (almost) always stay on top. the hard part is to get such a monolithic entity moving
07:18:46 <shapr> Anyway, one of my side projects has been to find a way to allow unaugmented humans to communicate securely in the presence of eavesdroppers with lots of computing power.
07:19:20 <shapr> Spoken crypto seems like one approach, and I've found a few ways to make that work.
07:19:53 <jethr0> interesting
07:20:12 <shapr> I've also thought up a ten touching fingertips inside grasping hands approach that might work.
07:23:08 * shapr also thinks up simpler and more powerful firearms, childrens toys to teach lambda calculus, cheap and effective icebreaker accessories for boats...
07:25:02 <jethr0> :)
07:25:23 <palomer> I feel like programming
07:25:27 <palomer> but I haven't figured out what yet
07:26:39 <shapr> Oh I had a neat idea recently... free adio earbuds that don't require batteries.
07:26:56 <xerox_> shapr: how would they work?
07:27:23 <shapr> Much like solar cells without requiring the tortuous process of extracting electricity from the sun.
07:27:33 <shapr> First of all, radio waves directly cause a current, right?
07:28:03 <jethr0> palomer: that can be fixed :)
07:28:24 <shapr> So make the most efficient antenna you can for as wide a range of frequencies as you can fit into a certain size, and use all the EMP around you as power.
07:28:56 <jethr0> the general idea is old. there are transistor radios that work purely with the energy from the radio signal
07:29:10 <jethr0> in fact they are very simple
07:29:26 <shapr> Yup, just hasn't been applied to powering computers yet.
07:29:43 <jethr0> true, although smart cards are sth in that direction
07:30:34 <shapr> Most computer peripherals require some heavy power to operate, screens, wifi, etc. I picked earbuds because they appear to require the least power.
07:31:15 <shapr> I think that would be particularly true of electrostatic earbuds.
07:31:53 <shapr> I was thinking about using liquid crystals for 'bifocal' on manyfocal contacts recently.
07:31:58 <shapr> s/on/or
07:33:35 <shapr> I think smart contact lenses could easily measure the shape of the lens of the wearer according to the flexing of the contact lens itself. So, if you can arbitrarily change the focus of the lens, sense the 'requested focus' of the wearer and see if the lens can go from a telescope to microscope.
07:34:13 * shapr is an unlimited source of marginal ideas...
07:35:15 <tuomov> I wonder if the quality of the sound will be that good (I haven't seen a good wireless earphone)
07:35:28 <tuomov> and then there's the issue of picking up some strong signal on the same frequency
07:35:38 <tuomov> digital earbuds, otoh, will require more power
07:36:52 <shapr> tuomov: Electrostatic headphones have the best quality sound. Plus antennae always pick up signals on all frequencies they can receive, they just filter the signal. The idea is to use the unfiltered input as power for the cpu and speaker.
07:37:59 <shapr> A Faraday Cage is designed to be the ultimate antenna, it catches/stops all incoming EMP.
07:38:43 <shapr> Nuclear explosions produce huge amounts of EMF on all frequencies, so much that it burns out electronics. I just want to exploit that on a smaller level.
07:39:09 <Spark> all you have to do is use your headphones in a prison environment
07:39:13 <jethr0> i wonder if a faraday's cage would protect circuitry from EMPs. that sounds too easy :)
07:39:31 <shapr> If it's not a mesh cage, it'll work.
07:39:57 <integral> where does the energy go though?  heating the cage?
07:39:58 <tuomov> it'll protect it from the interesting signal too :)
07:40:01 <davidhouse> shapr, nice idea. although i'd worry about how much current would be induced in the size of a cage you could build into headphones.
07:40:25 <shapr> davidhouse: Yeah, it's probably not feasible right now, but power demands are dropping as fast as MHz goes up.
07:40:33 <davidhouse> you can buy radios that don't need any power. they just sit in your ear and don't amplify the signal at all.
07:40:44 <shapr> integral: Nah, Faraday Cages must have a ground wire... because it produces electricty.
07:41:14 <Spark> it turns the cage into a capacitor, presumably
07:41:15 <integral> ah
07:41:20 <Spark> or the cage and the ground more likely
07:41:25 <shapr> davidhouse: Has anyone tried to make a powered radio that receives on many frequencies to power the whole unit?
07:41:52 <davidhouse> shapr, i wouldn't know.
07:42:30 <shapr> My original inspiration actually came from considering Bose condensates as a Faraday Cage. They'd catch *everything*.
07:42:33 <tuomov> I wonder how much power the transmitter would need
07:42:49 <tuomov> it's quite impractical if a portable transmitter would need twice the battery
07:42:56 <tuomov> battery lifes are not increasing :(
07:43:04 <davidhouse> tuomov: the transmitter is the BBC.
07:43:18 <tuomov> but for general-purpose earbuds, not just a radio
07:43:21 <davidhouse> or whatever national radio you happen to have in your country.
07:43:48 <davidhouse> tuomov: i think the idea is to use the ambient radio waves to power the thing
07:43:50 <shapr> But why limit the power to just a few frequencies?
07:43:53 <shapr> Right!
07:44:02 <shapr> There's *lots* of EMF flying around us, why not use it?
07:44:09 <shapr> Instead of a solar cell, it's an EMF cell.
07:44:21 <tuomov> davidhouse: I'm thinking of connecting such a earbuds to an mp3 mplayer
07:44:37 <tuomov> would the player need lots more power to transmit a signal the earbuds can pick up?
07:44:37 <davidhouse> tuomov: i.e. you don't actually listen to the radio. just use the current induced by it to power the transmitter/signal filterer/amplifier
07:45:14 <Spark> i dont think theres that much noise
07:45:21 <shapr> Anyway, I'm going off to do paying work now instead of coming up with crazy ideas.
07:45:25 <Spark> unless you live next to a substation or something :)
07:45:57 <shapr> Spark: There's a given amount of noise, question is, can it power the electronics we use, and if not, how small does the hardware need to be to run off the existing noise?
07:46:07 <davidhouse> Spark, well in the UK we have ~20 radio stations you can tune into at any one time on FM, loads more on AM, then you've got television signals, mobile phone signals, general radio-control signals
07:46:10 <davidhouse> perhaps even light.
07:46:31 <tuomov> we don't have light here :)
07:46:35 <Spark> heh
07:46:57 <Spark> the frequencies that carry the most energy are also the hardest to convert, no?
07:47:08 <shapr> I don't know.
07:47:10 <Spark> because you need tiny antennae
07:47:21 <shapr> Like I said, I am an infinite stream of marginal ideas...
07:47:55 <davidhouse> Spark, i'd guess so. but then if we're working at the size of earphones we want a small antenna anyway.
07:48:14 * shapr work &
07:48:17 <Spark> hmm, how about using heat
07:48:20 <Spark> from the body
07:48:33 <davidhouse> i'd even put my money where my mouth is and say it should be possible to build an antenna into a microchip. that would be small.
07:49:08 <Spark> you need analogue components though, can you put them in a microchip?
07:49:22 <Spark> (im assming all this) :)
07:49:24 <jethr0> i'd think that using body energy might be a good bet too. if the devices energy requirements are realisticly low
07:49:27 <davidhouse> which analogues components?
07:49:40 <davidhouse> Spark, yeah, i'm no electrical engineer either :)
07:49:59 <Spark> when you receive the signal you get a voltage, but the chip is all digital surely
07:50:32 <Spark> thing is, they wouldnt work if you went underground :)
07:50:37 <tuomov> for a digital chip I guess you have to convert the signal to stable DC
07:50:41 <tuomov> that could be easier said than done
07:50:50 <tuomov> an analog circuit otoh just resonates to the signal
07:50:55 <Spark> also, the high energy waves probably wouldnt get through the head
07:51:38 <davidhouse> yeah, you need DC for a speaker.
07:51:38 <jethr0> and if they did, that might not be the very best for your health
07:51:44 <davidhouse> or you need AC. or something.
07:52:05 <davidhouse> jethr0: well they're going through our heads regardless, its just a matter if we catch them or not.
07:52:06 <tuomov> err. a speaker by definition takes an alternating voltage
07:52:15 <tuomov> that's its operation principle
07:52:35 <Spark> the waves that go straight through the body, probably do so because the body isnt a large enough antenna? :)
07:52:41 <jethr0> yup, but with changing frequency, obviously
07:52:44 <tuomov> the voltage changes at the same frequencies as the signal
07:52:54 <tuomov> but for a digital chip you probably need a stable voltage/current
07:53:00 <tuomov> but the signal isn't such
07:53:38 <davidhouse> pfft.
07:53:47 <davidhouse> just build a buffer into it. that's not a problem.
07:54:02 <tuomov> can you make it efficient and stable enough?
07:54:24 <davidhouse> that's where my electrical knowledge ends :)
07:54:30 <davidhouse> but i'd guess yes.
07:54:32 <liyang> `digital' chips are just an abstraction. They don't exist.
07:54:38 <tuomov> it's just some capacitor hackery, yes, but I'm no EE
07:55:18 <Spark> actually, rfid already does this
07:55:19 <Spark> duh
07:55:34 <Spark> its just not very sophisticated
07:55:40 <tuomov> yep, rfid operates this way, but the device in the tag is quite simple
07:57:12 <tuomov> they do have a cmos, though
07:57:54 <tuomov> I wonder what kind of signal it is that the readers transmit
07:58:12 <tuomov> I'd guess some stable frequency that matches the frequency the cmos can operate at
07:58:19 <Spark> yeah
07:58:36 <Spark> its just a tone i think
07:58:38 <Spark> but quite a powerful one
07:58:59 <Spark> actually no it has an awful range
08:03:05 <SimonRC> okaaay, open question:
08:03:34 <SimonRC> I think I will want to embed a scripting language in my Haskell program.  Which one should I choose
08:03:37 <SimonRC> ?
08:05:54 <wilx> Haskell? :)
08:06:44 <SimonRC> wilx: Eh?
08:07:42 <Lemmih> > "Haskell?"
08:07:43 <oasisbot> "Haskell?"
08:07:59 <edwinb> Haskell seems a good choice to me...
08:08:18 <SimonRC> How would I do that?
08:08:26 <wilx> Surprised? You can load and execute Haskell modules dynamically from source whith this Haskell library what's name I do not remember anymore :)
08:08:28 <Lemmih> Pretty heavyweigt solution, though.
08:08:29 <edwinb> hsplugins is one way
08:08:37 <edwinb> Or you could write a simple DSL I suppose.
08:08:41 <wilx> Right, that's what I meant.
08:09:02 <SimonRC> DSL?
08:09:06 <edwinb> Domain Specific Language
08:09:10 <SimonRC> ah, ok
08:10:24 <SimonRC> I would have thought the advantages Haskell has for big apps (e.g. purity, static types), would mostly get in the way in tiny scripts.
08:10:41 * SimonRC googles hsplugins.
08:10:46 <shapr> @where hsplugins
08:10:47 <oasisbot> I know nothing about hsplugins.
08:10:49 <shapr> @where hs-plugins
08:10:50 <oasisbot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
08:11:43 <edwinb> SimonRC: what sort of things will your scripting language do?
08:12:50 <edwinb> I'm sure you'll find it more fun to write your own simple language :)
08:13:45 <SimonRC> Initially, it could just be filling in big collections of structures, but later would expand to things like map-generation and a DSL for monster AI.
08:14:01 <tuomov> Lua's rather nice, and it shouldn't be too difficult to write haskell bindings either
08:14:28 <SimonRC> I have seen bindings for Caml, but not any for Haskell.
08:14:31 <tuomov> and Lua's used quite a lot in games :)
08:14:46 <SimonRC> Impurity could be a bit tricky.
08:15:00 <SimonRC> Actually, I have already started language, but it is a bit, ah, esoteric.
08:15:17 <pejo> tuomov, in what way is lua nice? I know nothing about the language, hence the question.
08:15:36 <SimonRC> pejo: *really* simple in concept.
08:15:47 <tuomov> but has first class functions, coroutines, and stuff
08:16:00 <SimonRC> Almost as simple as LISP's base, but a little more powerful.
08:16:44 <shapr> SimonRC: Have you seen Philippa's Template Haskell DSL compiler?
08:16:45 <tuomov> On the negative side, the standard libs are a bit too limited due to their insistence of sticking to ansi c
08:16:53 <SimonRC> shapr: no
08:16:54 <tuomov> but at least they're not bloated as is more common
08:17:30 <shapr> pejo: You can see evidence of tuomov's use of Lua in the Ion window manager if you haven't already tried it.
08:17:57 * shapr hugs ion3
08:17:58 <pejo> shapr, twm until death do us apart! :P
08:18:01 <SimonRC> One problem is that the game might have to be saved suddenly by a user-interaction routine acting as an AI routine, so everything present at the point when any monster's AI gets consulted must be serializable.
08:18:21 <SimonRC> That's a more general problem, though.
08:18:58 <pejo> shapr, noticed C---compiler by Ramseys group uses it too. 
08:19:30 <SimonRC> shapr: where is this DSL compiler?
08:19:33 <araujo> Hello aorund here
08:20:15 <shapr> SimonRC: http://www.haskell.org/tmrwiki/ImpureThoughts_2f1
08:20:19 <tuomov> one rather annoying thing in lua that hasn't been fixed to this state is that they use the libc routines for number parsing
08:20:43 <tuomov> and that means locale settings will affect how the source is parsed
08:21:02 <tuomov> in e.g. finnish locale the decimal separator is a comma, and therefore it will not parse "5.0"
08:21:09 <tuomov> s/state/date/
08:21:33 <chrisbrown> what exactly does $ do in Haskell?
08:21:36 <shapr> pejo: ion3 roxx, it's worth trying if you haven't already.
08:21:44 <mauke> f $ x = f x
08:21:44 <chrisbrown> i thought it replaced brakets?
08:21:51 <shapr> Yeah, but it also means function application.
08:21:58 <tuomov> f $ x y = f (x y)
08:21:59 <chrisbrown> what is all this splicing stuff?
08:22:16 <shapr> $() means splice it Template Haskell.
08:22:32 <liyang> There was a nice sub-discussion on the associativity of $ on the haskell-{something} list a few days back.
08:22:32 <SimonRC> chrisbrown: $ replaces brakets becuse it have very low precedence and is right-associative -- clever, eh?
08:22:33 <chrisbrown> ah
08:22:39 <shapr> That caused a lot of breakage when it first went into GHC. People had to add a space after their $ that mean function application.
08:22:43 <chrisbrown> i see
08:22:48 <tuomov> I think they should've chosen another character for th..
08:22:56 <tuomov> I wish unicode was supported :)
08:23:01 * shapr too
08:23:08 <shapr> I wish unicode were easy to enter.
08:23:10 <liyang> It will be soon, non?
08:23:16 <musasabi> but that would break too much code.
08:23:16 <shapr> oui
08:23:41 <SimonRC> How many people *use* 8-bit chars in source anyway?
08:23:47 * shapr raises his hand
08:23:52 <SimonRC> hmm, ok
08:23:52 <musasabi> o/
08:23:56 <neologism> shapr: what for?
08:23:57 <SimonRC> in strings?
08:23:59 <shapr> But then again, I'm an alien...
08:24:02 <musasabi> shapr: yes.
08:24:06 * shapr grins
08:24:14 <musasabi> I meant SimonRC
08:24:14 <SimonRC> how about an encoding directive, what was decided on that?
08:24:17 * shapr laughs
08:24:34 <shapr> neologism: Seen pretty-lambda and friends?
08:24:40 <musasabi> SimonRC: mostly people writing code that has non-english things.
08:24:42 <neologism> no
08:24:43 <neologism> whats that?
08:24:57 <musasabi> x-symbol + emacs is a partial solution.
08:24:59 <shapr> @google emacs pretty lambda
08:25:00 <oasisbot> http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/misc/emacs/pretty-lambda.el
08:25:17 <musasabi> is pretty-lambda better/worse?
08:27:29 <shapr> I dunno how to answer.. it replaces textual words like lambda with a symbol instead.
08:29:08 <tuomov> greek letters and extra symbols are the most interesting in unicode
08:29:17 <musasabi> One problem with unicode is that standard unicode fonts have ugly greek letters :-(
08:29:28 <tuomov> as for the extra in latin1 over ascii, I have no particular need for in code itself
08:29:57 <tuomov> the lambda in misc-fixed doesn't look like the lambda I know :)
08:31:33 <tuomov> i's more like a mirror n with a hat
08:31:45 <SimonRC> Hmm, doesn't hs-plugins require a compiler to be present on the destination machine?
08:31:51 <SimonRC> s/destination //
08:34:03 <shapr> musasabi: Do you know of a better unicode font? I don't much like the mirror n with a tilde.
08:34:35 <palomer> hrm
08:34:44 <palomer> we should add another alphabet to our lexicon
08:35:45 <shapr> hiya malcolm
08:36:00 * nhc98 waves
08:36:45 <SimonRC> ah, yes: "Therefore, hs-plugins only works on platforms with a working GHCi."
08:37:08 <SimonRC> nhc98: erm, why are you a haskell system?
08:37:46 <nhc98> has anyone tried modifying hs-plugins to work with yhc yet?
08:38:53 <musasabi> shapr: no.
08:38:55 * palomer wonders how many haskell variants there are
08:39:44 <musasabi> GHC, Hugs, NHC, JHC, YHC, EHC, Helium, HBC, ...
08:39:48 <wolverian> given a type (DynGraph t) => t User [String], can I give it to graphviz' somehow? 
08:41:08 <nhc98> anyone seen SyntaxNinja around lately?  his email address has gone quiet
08:41:57 <musasabi> @seen SyntaxNinja
08:41:57 <oasisbot> I haven't seen SyntaxNinja.
08:42:07 <musasabi> I think he was here a few days ago
08:44:41 <Igloo> He generally appears at 5-something UK time (if he does at all)
08:45:20 <xerox_> Do we have an HTML parser?
08:46:13 <musasabi> xerox_: the xml toolkits have usually one.
08:46:19 <nhc98> Text.XML.HaXml.HTML.Parse
08:46:38 <musasabi> HaXML is simpler, but toolbox is more lax about html-errors.
08:46:46 <xerox_> I just want to take the linnks out of a page, in fact.
08:46:51 <xerox_> links, even.
08:47:15 <nhc98> Is the HTML well-formed like XHTML?
08:47:21 <xerox_> Yes.
08:47:55 <nhc98> You could try Xtract, which is a commandline tool that comes with HaXml
08:48:30 <nhc98> A query like Xtract "//a" would find all (and only) <a> elements at any depth.
08:49:16 <nhc98> (Xtract can also be used as a library from within a Haskell prog)
08:50:01 * xerox_ goes for a darcs-get
08:50:13 <nhc98> The query syntax is rather close to XPath.
08:50:26 <xerox_> What is XPath?
08:51:53 <xerox_> dcoutts: piiing!
08:51:59 <musasabi> nhc98: now add XSLT ;)
08:52:21 <xerox_> $ sudo make install
08:52:21 <xerox_> hugs-package src
08:52:21 <xerox_> make: hugs-package: Command not found
08:52:21 <xerox_> make: *** [install-hugs] Error 127
08:52:23 <xerox_> urgh.
08:53:13 <xerox_> 'make install-ghc' is probably enough
08:53:24 <nhc98> Do you want to install it for Hugs, or did it just do it anyway?
08:53:40 <xerox_> I do not care of hugs, and it did anyway.
08:54:08 <nhc98> you could do ./configure --buildwith=ghc  and it should ignore Hugs
08:54:14 <vincenz> shapr: you use apache
08:54:14 <vincenz> ?
08:54:38 <jethr0> vincenz: still on it :)
08:54:54 <vincenz> jethr0: ?
08:55:05 <xerox_> nhc98: right!  There's a little problem with ghc-pkg, though...
08:55:06 <nhc98> xerox_: XPath is just a URL-like short syntax for navigating through a tree document structure
08:55:20 <jethr0> vincenz: have you been struggling with apache for the last couple of hours?
08:55:24 <vincenz> YES
08:55:32 <jethr0> *damn*, what's not working?
08:55:33 <vincenz> it's pissing me off
08:55:34 <shapr> vincenz: yup
08:55:41 <vincenz> jethr0: well it works if I just use my blog as my DocumentRoot
08:55:43 <vincenz> however
08:55:44 <xerox_> nhc98: http://rafb.net/paste/results/ymRuQT90.html
08:55:51 <vincenz> if I have normal site
08:55:59 <vincenz> and Alias /blog /var/www/blog/public
08:56:02 <vincenz> it won't work
08:56:05 <jethr0> you have to allow script/cgi execution for other directories
08:56:10 <vincenz> I do
08:56:20 <shapr> vincenz: Can you put your apache config files online?
08:56:33 <nhc98> xerox_: there's no problem with ghc-pkg there.
08:57:03 <vincenz> http://rafb.net/paste/results/6pQ86083.html
08:57:08 <vincenz> if I only use the blog
08:57:10 <vincenz> (at the bottom)
08:57:12 <vincenz> with no alias
08:57:13 <vincenz> it works fine
08:57:15 <nhc98> xerox_: the script tries two ways of registering the package, for old-style and cabal-style.
08:57:30 <vincenz> but if I want to do traditional apache with blog in /blog ... it just shows the files
08:57:37 <xerox_> nhc98: Right.  Thanks very much for the informations.
08:57:40 <nhc98> xerox_: the old style fails, but that is OK, because the cabal-style works.
08:57:41 <vincenz> it's pissing me off :/
08:57:58 <jethr0> have you set "index.php" as potential start page?
08:58:19 <vincenz> the .htaccess of the blog works fine... like I said if I only run the blog udner / without the Alias, it works
08:58:35 <vincenz> however if I want to see my normal html files like they were, and my blog under /blog/
08:58:39 <vincenz> it just shows the files in /blog/
08:58:46 <vincenz> and doesn't do the whole rails sjpiel
08:59:48 <shapr> vincenz: Here's what I use - http://www.scannedinavian.com/~shae/apache-config
09:00:44 <SimonRC> Maybe I *won't* need a scripting language for a while:  http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/yale/papers/icsr98/dsl.pdf
09:01:34 <SimonRC> (Summary: revenge of the Embedded Domain-Specific Languages -- in Haskell)
09:01:39 <xerox_> nhc98: this is the documentation I should read up, right? http://www.haskell.org/HaXml/Xtract.html
09:01:44 <vincenz> I'm givinig up
09:01:48 <vincenz> I'll install lighttpd tonight
09:03:57 <nhc98> xerox_:  yeah, more or less.
09:04:08 * vincenz is seriously frustrated
09:04:51 <xerox_> nhc98: can I extract directly just the href attribute somehow?
09:05:24 <nhc98> Xtract "//a/@href" I think
09:06:47 <davidhouse> ooh, XPath :)
09:07:15 <xerox_> nhc98: is there any example usage of xtract as a library?
09:08:19 <chrisbrown> do you know if Haskell provides functions to write data to a file based on line and column information?
09:08:49 <chrisbrown> basically, i need to insert a string into a file - and i know the location of where the string needs to go but nothing else
09:09:00 <nhc98> xerox_: not directly.  Have a look at http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/HaXml-1.14/HaXml/Text-XML-HaXml-Xtract-Parse.html for the 'xtract' function
09:09:52 <nhc98> xerox_: then you'll need to follow an example that uses the CFilter type, to see how to use it
09:10:37 <nhc98> (Sadly, worked examples are a weak point of the HaXml documentation)
09:12:38 <xerox_> nhc98: where can I find such an axample?
09:14:43 <nhc98> xerox_: the ICFP99 paper on the HaXml webpage has an example.  There might be a copy of the code for it in the examples/ directory too, if you are lucky.
09:16:42 <A-Tui> hi
09:18:42 <xerox_> ...grepping 'xtract' does not give results back, duh.  Mind to elaborate a little bit on those 'CFilter's?
09:21:59 <nhc98> xerox_: a CFilter is a document transformation.  Xtract is just one possible transformation.  If you look for the code sections in that paper, you will see lots more detail.  The main thing you want is the way to use a CFilter.  I think it is called 'processXmlWith'.
09:27:22 <xerox_> Yay, I wonder why does it read from stdin instead that getting a String argument.
09:29:37 <nhc98> xerox_: you could always look at the way processXmlWith is implemented and roll-your-own variation for reading from a string, a file, etc.
09:30:27 * nhc98 waves at SyntaxNinja 
09:30:52 * jethr0 is slowly getting there with his stupid alpha-beta-search
09:31:03 <dcoutts> xerox, pooong!
09:31:24 <xerox_> dcoutts: what's up mate :-)
09:31:29 <dcoutts> xerox, actually, can't stop. I'll talk later.
09:31:32 <xerox_> nhc98: that's a good idea.
09:31:39 <xerox_> dcoutts: no problem.  Later!
09:33:53 <davidhouse> hi guys.
09:34:07 <SyntaxNinja> hiya nhc98
09:34:08 <davidhouse> what's the generally accepted way of making GUI apps in haskell?
09:34:26 <SyntaxNinja> post them to the great language shootout?
09:34:39 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: can you guess what I want to bug you about today? :-)
09:35:01 <liyang> davidhouse: gtk2hs? wxHaskell?
09:35:11 <davidhouse> @google gtk2hs
09:35:12 <oasisbot> http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/
09:35:15 <davidhouse> liyang: thanks
09:36:21 <davidhouse> does haskell have any kind of package distribution system planned like ruby's gems?
09:36:41 <Igloo> cabal might be the answer, but I don't know what a gem is
09:36:46 <Igloo> @where cabal
09:36:46 <oasisbot> http://www.haskell.org/cabal
09:37:01 <Igloo> (whobot?)
09:37:08 <davidhouse> Igloo, think PHP's PEAR if you're not familiar with gems.
09:37:09 <wolverian> argh, I can't figure this out. I give the graph from mkMapGraph to graphviz' and it complains about an ambiguous type variable! 
09:37:22 <davidhouse> python's got one too, but i can't remember its name
09:37:23 <Igloo> davidhouse: Still doesn't help me  :-)
09:37:26 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: no!
09:37:53 <davidhouse> Igloo: open terminal, 'pear install pkgname'. ta-da, it's installed and ready to use
09:38:15 <SyntaxNinja> davidhouse: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage
09:38:19 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: I still haven't got my trac environment working properly - you suggested you might be able to help?
09:38:23 <Igloo> We're working towards that with cabal
09:38:36 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: oh, you're malcolm. hehe
09:38:43 <davidhouse> Igloo, nice :)
09:39:04 <SyntaxNinja> davidhouse: "cabal-get install packagename" works at beta quality
09:39:08 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: oops, yes, I forgot I didn't get my usual nick today
09:40:06 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: let me see if I can do that before someone comes over to interrupt me...
09:40:23 <davidhouse> is gtk2hs written in haskell or C?
09:40:35 <SyntaxNinja> davidhouse: do you want to help hack on hackage??
09:40:38 <SyntaxNinja> we need hackers!
09:41:01 <SyntaxNinja> davidhouse: here are 'easy' tasks for cabal: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=milestone&difficulty=easy&difficulty=very+easy&order=priority
09:41:05 <davidhouse> SyntaxNinja: nowhere near experienced enough, really. i've been writing haskell for about two weeks :)
09:42:02 <davidhouse> aww, there's no "very easy" ones :(
09:43:13 <davidhouse> SyntaxNinja: on the other hand, i like to learn by poking, so i'll probably download the source :)
09:43:28 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: thanks for your help - gotta go now - might check in again here later
09:43:48 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: wanna try creating an account real quick?
09:44:04 <nhc98> OK, I have a few minutes
09:44:41 <davidhouse> is gtk2hs written in haskell?
09:45:08 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: hooray! it works.  
09:45:27 <davidhouse> SyntaxNinja: what's hackage then?
09:45:41 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: ls /srv/darcs/PolyFunViz
09:45:43 <SyntaxNinja> and browse source
09:45:47 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: the darcs repo exists now as well
09:45:49 <SyntaxNinja> looks like it works, but add a file and let me know if it doesn't
09:46:11 <nhc98> SyntaxNinja: will do that later - really gotta go now.  Bye!
09:46:12 <SyntaxNinja> davidhouse: cabal is the build system, hackage is the over-all package infrastructure
09:46:15 <SyntaxNinja> l8r nhc98
09:46:29 <davidhouse> SyntaxNinja: ah, cool.
09:55:47 <audreyt> @pl \(x,y) -> VList [x,y]
09:55:48 <oasisbot> uncurry ((VList .) . (. return) . (:))
09:58:37 <davidhouse> pointlessness is rather pointless.
09:59:08 <xerox_> Hmpf.  Xtract doesn't like my html.
09:59:11 <davidhouse> try telling me uncurry ((VList .) . (. return) . (:)) is more elegant or readable than @pl \(x,y) -> VList [x,y]
10:00:49 <xerox_> ....and it is a Google page, grumble.
10:00:56 <palomer> oh, that's only because you don't speak combinator
10:00:59 <jethr0> davidhouse: depends on the case. but often pointsfree style is harder to read
10:01:14 <xerox_> @pl \f xs -> xs >>= return . f
10:01:15 <oasisbot> fmap
10:01:18 <xerox_> ;-)
10:01:27 <davidhouse> xerox_: that's different.
10:01:43 <lennart_> it's also wrong :)
10:01:54 <jethr0> @pl \(a,b) -> (f a, g b)
10:01:54 <davidhouse> for simple examples like (=x).(^2) i don't see any problem with it.
10:01:55 <oasisbot> f *** g
10:02:05 <xerox_> lennart_: is it?
10:02:25 <mauke> shouldn't it be liftM?
10:02:29 <bd__> @hoogle argv
10:02:30 <oasisbot> No matches found
10:02:31 <lennart_> yup
10:02:32 <xerox_> fmap is liftM
10:02:40 <davidhouse> bd__, getArgs

10:02:50 <bd__> davidhouse: thanks
10:02:51 <xerox_> jethr0: Monads are Functors
10:02:53 <palomer> different types
10:02:57 <lennart_> being a monad doesn't imply being a Functor (it should, though)
10:03:02 <xerox_> Indeed.
10:05:33 <jethr0> @pl \x -> even x || odd x
10:05:34 <oasisbot> liftM2 (||) even odd
10:06:06 <jethr0> @pl \x -> f x >> return x
10:06:07 <oasisbot> liftM2 (>>) f return
10:06:16 <jethr0> i just love it :)
10:06:56 <lennart_> did lambdabot retire?
10:07:07 <jethr0> @pl \x -> any [f x, g x, h x]
10:07:08 <oasisbot> any . liftM2 (:) f (liftM2 (:) g (return . h))

10:07:15 <oasisbot> flip . (ap .) . flip (.)
10:07:16 <davidhouse> @seen lambdabot
10:07:16 <oasisbot> Last time I saw lambdabot was when I left #haskell 12 days, 51 minutes
10:07:16 <oasisbot> and 7 seconds ago, and I have missed 11 days, 17 hours, 39 minutes and 57
10:07:16 <oasisbot> seconds since then.
10:07:24 <xerox_> @pl \h f g x -> f x `h` g x
10:07:24 <oasisbot> liftM2
10:07:24 <davidhouse> it referes to 'lambdabot' as 'I'. hmm...
10:07:30 <xerox_> :)
10:10:36 <lennart_> the e-> monad is great for getting combinators
10:12:48 <lennart_> grrrr, such a flaky connection i have.  Point those antennas straight guys!
10:18:26 <davidhouse> hi
10:18:32 <davidhouse> trying to install gtk2hs.
10:18:42 <davidhouse> it compiles fine, but on make i'm getting an error.
10:18:48 <davidhouse> the last few lines: http://pastebin.com/556301
10:20:00 <davidhouse> err, i meant it configures fine.
10:20:17 <jonkri> i have a list [1, 2, 3] and a list [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]. is there a function that i can use in my non-recursive function that turns them into [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]?
10:21:06 <liyang> lol.
10:21:13 <gzl> err
10:21:13 <liyang> Is this a homework question?
10:21:17 <gzl> jonkri: use (:)
10:21:26 <gzl> it's just adding something to a list...
10:21:41 <gzl> > [1] : [[2], [3]]
10:21:42 <oasisbot> [[1],[2],[3]]
10:21:52 <jonkri> i thought i could only use ":" to split lists, like in (x:xs)
10:22:01 <gzl> no, you use them to put them together
10:22:05 <gzl> * it
10:22:07 <palomer> when doing type inference, can expressions in bindings put constraints on variables outside bindings?
10:22:08 <xerox_> jonkri: (:) is a function
10:22:12 <palomer> I'm guessing so, eh?
10:22:14 <gzl> it's just a function
10:22:14 <xerox_> @type (:)
10:22:15 <oasisbot> forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]
10:22:26 <gzl> the (x:xs) thing is a pattern match
10:22:34 <jonkri> ok, thanks
10:22:36 <liyang> Isn't it technically a constructor? (Which means you can use it in pattern matching.)
10:23:10 <xerox_> liyang: yeah, it's more correct to say that it is a special kind a function, a constructor one.
10:23:20 <xerox_> That's why you can use it for patter-match.
10:23:34 <xerox_> (It's even more special 'cos you can't define a similar one, neither redefine it.)
10:24:02 <jonkri> i see
10:25:17 <davidhouse> anyone got any experience with gtk2hs?
10:26:22 <lennart_> palomer: yes, if the binding mentions variables bound outside
10:27:03 <liyang> davidhouse: a good few people here... got any specific questions?
10:27:19 <davidhouse> liyang, i'm having troubles compiling it.
10:27:39 <davidhouse> it configures fine, but then when i try to make, http://pastebin.com/556301
10:27:53 <davidhouse> (that's the last few lines)
10:31:23 <jonkri> thanks for your help, people! see you!
10:31:47 <vincenz> Question brouwer's theorem
10:31:57 <vincenz> it says "for any continuous endomap there's a fixedpoint"
10:32:11 <vincenz> what about f: R -> R, f(x) = x^2+1
10:32:19 <vincenz> there's no fixed point, yet this function is continuous
10:32:43 <vincenz> or is analytical continuity not the same as continuity used in category theory?
10:34:43 <lennart_> vincenz: so for analytical functions i've only seen the theorem stated differently
10:35:08 <vincenz> lennart_: ?
10:36:00 <lennart_> that the function is continuous from the unit sphere to the unit sphere
10:36:34 <vincenz> hmm
10:37:14 <lennart_> as usual, wikipedia has something to say :)
10:37:50 <vincenz> yeah but
10:37:56 <vincenz> x*x+1 never cuts x=y
10:38:35 <palomer> lennart_: so, when doing type inference, you start at the most nested binding and work your way up, right?
10:38:53 <palomer> gathering constraints along the way
10:39:14 <lennart_> palomer: you can do type inference many ways
10:39:38 <Igloo> If you're purely constraing gathering and then solving then it doesn't matter what order you gather the constraints in
10:40:51 <lennart_> when i've done type inference it's been more of a two pass thing.  you descend gathering bindings and solve constraints (with unification) on the way out
10:41:01 <kombinator> davidhouse: looks like some incompatiblility between gtk2hs and your version of gtk headers
10:41:16 <kombinator> davidhouse: which version of gtk do you have?
10:43:52 <palomer> lennart_: ahh, so you'll get things like a = b -> d ; a = generalization f ; f = x -> y ?
10:46:25 <lennart_> palomer: i'm not sure what you're trying to say
10:46:34 <astrolabe> vincenz: it cuts it at infinity
10:46:53 <astrolabe> I bet brower's fp theorem needs compactness
10:47:08 <astrolabe> and the real line isn't compact unless you include infinity.
10:48:32 <astrolabe> Ah, Brower's theorym is about unit balls
10:48:54 <palomer> lennart_: let's say the expression is "let f a b = a b in f", and you decided to gather constraints and them solve them elsewhere, and the toplevel existential variable is x, then you'd get x = y, y = generalization t, t = (u->v)->(u->v), right?
10:49:07 <lennart_> astrolabe: or anything that can be mapped to the unit ball
10:49:33 <astrolabe> So it doesn't apply because (\x->x*x+1)  does not map [-1,1] to [-1,1]
10:50:03 <astrolabe> lennart_ yes
10:50:24 <astrolabe> anything homeomorphic to the unit ball
10:50:28 <palomer> which has solution x = generization (u->v)->(u->v) ,ie forall u. forall v. (u->v)->(u->v)
10:50:33 <astrolabe> which doesn't include the real line
10:51:09 <lennart_> palomer: I've never tried type inference by saving all constraints to the top level.  I think it's easier if you solve what you need at generalization points
10:51:24 <astrolabe> (even with infinity included :(  )
10:51:41 <palomer> lennart_: how would that work?
11:01:13 <lennart_> palomer: when you hit a let you figure out what to generalize over and then you solve for those variables.  losely speaking
11:01:32 <palomer> lennart_: for example?
11:02:43 <lennart_> for example 'let f x = (x, y) in ...'  you see that the type variable associated with x should be generaized at that let
11:02:58 <davidhouse> kobinator, you still around?
11:03:13 <davidhouse> kombinator, you still around?
11:12:57 <sjanssen> I'd like to generate some images, any reccomendations on libraries?
11:15:48 <palomer> lennart_: so you solve for x?
11:16:06 <palomer> or, rather, the type variable associated with x
11:18:26 <vincenz> astrolabe: ah I see...and if it's not infinite then at some point you have to either cut the boundary or have a fixedpoint in the center
11:18:30 <lennart_> yeah, something like that :)
11:20:43 <palomer> I would solve for the type variable associated with f
11:20:46 <palomer> and then generalize over all its variables
11:21:08 <palomer> and then every time I need to unify with f, I instantiate with existential variables
11:25:32 <lennart_> palomer: yes.  you solve for the vars introduced by f, i.e., those not occurring anywhere else.
11:25:49 <lennart_> solve&generalize
11:27:04 <palomer> so, the gist of it, is to make sure to unify the variables generalized by f before proceeding, amiright?
11:29:15 <lennart_> you want to know what variables are oniversally quantified by the definition of f, so you can instantiate these at later uses of f
11:30:00 <liyang> Where can I find up to date packages of gtk2hs for Debian? (If they exist at all?)
11:32:31 * liyang is building his own using the old /debian/ scripts and the current tarball.
11:33:09 <liyang> I don't have too much confidence in it working correctly though...
11:34:40 <edwinb> I tried and failed to find packages for debian, but it did build without problems...
11:35:06 <liyang> *nod*
11:35:10 <vincenz> dumdumdu
11:35:50 * liyang would just like it all in an easily removable .deb
11:36:21 <edwinb> there may have been one for the wrong version of ghc, although I can't remember
11:37:13 <liyang> there is, for GHC 6.2, at http://haskell-unsafe.alioth.debian.org/archive/i386
11:41:54 <jethr0> i just had a strange ghc "bug"
11:42:31 <jethr0> type inference said that a function had type "Tree Double -> Tree Double", and the compiler gave an error consistent with that
11:42:50 <jethr0> "expected "Tree Double -> Tree Double", got: "Tree Int -> Tree Int""
11:43:23 <jethr0> when i added a type declaration, saying that the function was "Tree Int -> Tree Int", the error disappeared and everything was fine again
11:43:26 <jethr0> ?!??!
11:44:48 <jethr0> but as i can't reproduce it, it was most likely plain old stupidity on my part *argh*
11:45:12 <liyang> GHC is probably defaulting to types other than what you were expecting, I imagine.
11:45:42 <jethr0> yes, but i thought the type inference was _always_ giving the most general type
11:46:20 <liyang> Could you paste the code somewhere?
11:46:44 <liyang> @paste
11:46:44 <oasisbot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
11:46:47 <jethr0> as i said, i can't reproduce it. but maybe with some editor undoing...
11:46:58 <liyang> oh. :-/
11:47:10 <jethr0> i'll try
11:48:17 <stepcut> Is this broken for anyone else? start ghci, do :m + Foreign.Marshal.Alloc and run, allocaBytes (100*1024*1024) $ \_ -> getLine
11:48:26 <musasabi> Is there a way to create temporary files in a portable fashion with GHC?
11:48:35 <stepcut> that should suck up 100MB of virtual memory, but when you hit enter, it does not free it...
11:49:09 <stepcut> System.IO.openTempFile
11:49:10 <stepcut> ?
11:50:02 <jethr0> liyang: ok, i got it reproduced. but the code is more of a mess than you wanna look at today
11:50:05 <jethr0> :)
11:50:20 <liyang> fair enough. I'm off home for dinner anyway. :)
11:51:45 <musasabi> grah, and I was looking at System.Posix.Temp
11:51:50 <musasabi> stepcut: thanks.
12:01:14 <stepcut> musasabi: no problem, my browser happened to be open to that function because I was looking at something else in System.IO :p
12:06:38 <ezraburgh> jethr0: with type classes, the compiler can sometimes infer a default type, where a type annotation would resolve it to other than that type.
12:06:46 <ezraburgh> for example:
12:06:56 <ezraburgh> read "1"
12:06:57 <ezraburgh> gives
12:06:57 <ezraburgh> 1
12:07:07 <ezraburgh> read "\"foo\""
12:07:13 <ezraburgh> *** Exception: Prelude.read: no parse
12:07:23 <ezraburgh> but read "\"foo\"" :: String
12:07:29 <ezraburgh> "foo"
12:07:43 <magnus--> Hi, does anyone know of some web host that supports haskell and/or common lisp?
12:10:05 <vincenz> Anyone have typo
12:12:21 <jethr0> type classes are just GREAT. it just takes some time to get used to them :)
12:13:10 <vincenz> jethr0: yeah :)
12:13:17 <vincenz> jethr0: my blog works \o/
12:13:19 <jethr0> my alpha-beta thingey finally works
12:13:22 <jethr0> congrats
12:13:39 <vincenz> thx!
12:14:39 <Cale> magnus--: anything with general executable CGI support
12:14:49 <Cale> (at least in the case of Haskell)
12:15:15 <vincenz> jethr0: congrat
12:15:30 <jethr0> yeah, and with all the premature optimizations as well ^_^
12:15:52 <jethr0> the only remaining questions are: do i have space leaks, and is it crawling slow
12:17:19 <jethr0> can i say "-infinity" in haskell somehow?
12:17:31 <xerox_> > -Inf
12:17:34 <oasisbot>  Not in scope: data constructor `Inf'
12:17:40 <xerox_> > -1/0
12:17:42 <oasisbot> -Infinity
12:17:55 <jethr0> > -(-1/0)
12:17:56 <oasisbot> Infinity
12:18:00 <jethr0> he
12:18:10 <jethr0> > -Infinity
12:18:11 <oasisbot>  Not in scope: data constructor `Infinity'
12:18:17 <jethr0> hmm
12:18:18 <xerox_> :)
12:18:30 <jethr0> i
12:19:09 <mauke> > read "Infinity" :: Double
12:19:10 <oasisbot> Infinity
12:19:20 <jethr0> that's just stupid
12:19:23 <jethr0> > Infinity
12:19:24 <oasisbot>  Not in scope: data constructor `Infinity'
12:19:26 <jethr0> very weird
12:19:50 <xerox_> > join (+) (read "Infinity" :: Double)
12:19:52 <oasisbot> Infinity

12:20:57 <jethr0>     | x <= y    =  LT
12:20:57 <jethr0>     | otherwise =  GT
12:21:06 <jethr0>     where (x,y) = (treeAnno b1, treeAnno b2)
12:21:18 <jethr0> the function "treeAnno" returns the "b" element of Tree
12:21:33 <jethr0> but for some weird reason ghc needs me to declare "Eq a"??
12:21:40 <xerox_> > join (==) (read "Infinity" :: Double)
12:21:42 <oasisbot> True
12:23:02 <xerox_> > uncurry (join (==)) . (id &&& (+1)) $ (read "Infinity" :: Double)

12:23:25 <magnus--> Cale: oh, cool. 
12:24:01 <xerox_> > i == i+1 where i = read "Infinity" :: Double
12:24:02 <oasisbot> True
12:24:06 <xerox_> Yay.
12:24:15 <Cale> magnus--: (of course, you have to be able to compile binaries for it :)
12:24:29 <xerox_> > i == 2^i where i = read "Infinity" :: Double
12:24:30 <oasisbot>  add an instance declaration for (Integral Double)
12:24:38 <xerox_> > i == 2**i where i = read "Infinity" :: Double
12:24:39 <oasisbot> True
12:24:43 <d0c> hey
12:24:46 <xerox_> Heh, is it true? :-)
12:24:53 <d0c> is it possible to catch exceptions using unsafePerformIO?
12:25:06 <Cale> xerox_: well, in floating point arithmetic, there's only one "Infinity"
12:25:21 <Cale> If you're talking about cardinals, that doesn't hold.
12:25:32 <xerox_> Right.
12:26:14 <Cale> d0c: probably
12:26:53 <d0c> unsafePerformIO (Control.Exception.catch (return ([1] !! 1)) (handleException))
12:27:13 <mauke> @type ("",)
12:27:14 <oasisbot> parse error on input `)'
12:27:26 <d0c> it doesn't do whats told in handleException

12:28:31 <Cale> 5
12:28:55 <d0c> i should be using handle instead of catch?
12:29:04 <Cale> handle and catch are the same thing
12:29:14 <Cale> (with parameters flipped)
12:29:29 <d0c> my bad
12:29:46 <jethr0> cale, you have an idea about the "Eq" thing above?
12:30:27 <Cale> jethr0: Where should I start reading the log from?
12:30:37 <jethr0> 21:20
12:31:03 <jethr0> it's not important. i'd just like to understand why the inference doesn't work

12:33:03 <Cale> instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Ord (Tree a b) -- why not (Ord b) => ?
12:33:27 <Cale> d0c: the [1] !! 1 isn't being evaluated until it's too late
12:33:33 <jethr0> because he then tells me that "Eq (Tree a b) can't be inferred from (Eq b)"
12:33:38 <Cale> returning that doesn't cause an error
12:33:54 <jethr0> does Ord a generally need Eq a?
12:34:01 <Cale> jethr0: yes
12:34:31 <Cale> class  (Eq a) => Ord a  where ...
12:34:34 <jethr0> hmm, even if i want to order only using parts of "a"
12:34:59 <Cale> Well, if you can define an instance of Ord, an instance of Eq is easy
12:35:14 <d0c> Thanks Cale
12:36:05 <jethr0> yes but "data Composite = Cons Diffcult Easy" and maybe i want to order just on the Easy part. but i guess adding an unnecessary "Eq a" won't hurt me :)
12:36:32 <Cale> data D a b = D a b
12:36:32 <Cale> instance (Eq b) => Eq (D a b) where
12:36:32 <Cale>     (D a b) == (D a' b') = b == b'
12:36:32 <Cale> instance (Ord b) => Ord (D a b) where
12:36:32 <Cale>     compare (D a b) (D a' b') = compare b b'
12:36:38 <Cale> that code works
12:36:55 <jethr0> hmm, that it seems to be an issue of using record accessors...
12:37:11 <Cale> Can I see your data declaration?
12:37:16 <jethr0> sure
12:39:21 <xerox_> Goodnight people.
12:39:24 <d0c> Cale, is there a way to make it being evaluated before it's too late?
12:39:35 <Cale> d0c: yeah, use evaluate, like I did :)
12:39:51 <Cale> @type Control.Exception.evaluate
12:39:52 <oasisbot> forall a. a -> IO a
12:40:03 <Cale> night xerox 
12:42:25 <lisppaste2> jethr0 pasted "inference" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/16831
12:43:30 <Cale> jethr0: you need to define an instance of Eq for Tree a b before you can define an instance of Ord
12:43:49 <Cale> and you don't need Eq b in the class constraints for the instance of Ord
12:43:52 <Cale> just Ord b
12:44:32 <jethr0> yes, that's probably what i did "better" before. but it still produces the error
12:45:56 <lisppaste2> Cale annotated #16831 with "fixed" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/16831#1
12:46:42 <jethr0> Cale: thx

13:09:37 <vincenz> damn
13:09:48 <vincenz> anyone know how shapr made the category-diagram on his page on hawiki?
13:09:56 <Cale> xypic
13:10:23 <vincenz> it's a plugin for the wiki
13:10:25 <vincenz> ?
13:10:43 <Cale> it's a package for LaTeX which is supported
13:11:07 <vincenz> yeah but on, http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ShaeErisson , what does that wiki-code look like?
13:12:33 <Cale> why not just edit the page and see?

13:13:34 <vincenz> basically I have a typo blog
13:13:36 <vincenz> and wouldn't mind having that
13:13:45 <vincenz> but not for comments (cause it can get heavy)
13:14:48 <vincenz> Cale: is it possible to run xypic separately wiithout supporting all of latex?
13:15:34 <Cale> vincenz: well, no, but you could write a wrapper
13:18:39 <Cale> (the nodes and arrow labels are all rendered with LaTeX -- you can put arbitrary symbols/formulas/text on them)
13:19:12 <vincenz> ah thx
13:19:19 <vincenz> now to find a ruby plugin
13:20:30 <Cale> I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to write. All you have to do is run latex on the source, then convert the dvi into some suitable image format, usually via dvips and ps2image
13:20:56 <vincenz> eah
13:20:59 <vincenz> yeah

13:42:00 <palomer> ok, how does one infer the type of that manually?
13:42:27 <vincenz> damn, for some reason my blog is REALLY slow
13:42:32 <vincenz> and consumes a shiitload of cpu
13:42:37 <jethr0> vincenz: where's it at?
13:42:48 <vincenz> http://abstractoasis.dyndns.org:8080/blog/
13:43:18 <jethr0> who would have thought that tic-tac-toe had 360000 possible boards (not discounting symmetry)
13:43:33 <vincenz> well
13:43:43 <vincenz> no...
13:43:46 <vincenz> that can't be
13:43:49 <tromp_> can't be more than 19683
13:43:51 <vincenz> it's at most 3^9
13:43:52 <jethr0> it takes kinda long to print a tree containing all those
13:43:56 <vincenz> > 3**9
13:43:59 <oasisbot> 19683.0
13:44:02 <tromp_> :-P
13:44:09 <palomer> > 2**9
13:44:11 <oasisbot> 512.0
13:44:16 <jethr0> 3?
13:44:19 <jethr0> i'd have thought 9!
13:44:27 <palomer> well, it's a little more complicated than that
13:44:40 <palomer> but it's certainly smaller than 360 000
13:44:49 <vincenz> not really
13:44:51 <jethr0> why is 9! wrong?
13:44:53 <vincenz> it's less than that
13:44:55 <vincenz> think about it
13:44:57 <vincenz> each box
13:45:00 <vincenz> is either x, o or empty
13:45:03 <vincenz> so 3**9
13:45:08 <palomer> and there can only be one more x than o
13:45:15 <palomer> or o than x
13:45:17 <jethr0> sorry, i meant move combinations
13:45:17 <vincenz> right so even less
13:45:18 <jethr0> my fault
13:45:29 <astrolabe> 9! is about number of games rather than number of positions
13:45:36 <jethr0> yup, bad wording
13:45:52 * palomer wonders where all the type inferencers are at
13:46:06 <tromp_> i bet there's less than a 1000 positions
13:46:17 <palomer> @type \a -> let f c = (a,c) in f (a+2)
13:46:20 <oasisbot> forall a.
13:46:20 <oasisbot>             (Num a) =>
13:46:20 <oasisbot>             a -> (a, a)
13:46:48 <astrolabe> tromp: why?  I'd say more.
13:47:09 <tromp_> 850 probably
13:47:50 <jethr0> vincenz: when having posted a comment, the resulting page is a bit bleak :)
13:48:08 <palomer> @type \a -> let f (c::Int) = a in f a
13:48:09 <oasisbot> Int -> Int
13:48:19 <astrolabe> I assume you are counting equiv classes up to symmetry, and ignoring positions that occur after the game has finished, but not as it finishes?
13:48:24 <vincenz> jethr0: it's really fricking slow for some reason
13:48:34 <tromp_> just guessing:(
13:49:18 <tromp_> from the 19683, roughly half should not have the right color balance
13:49:28 <astrolabe> There is some kind of magic squarish code for ttt IIRC
13:49:31 <tromp_> then another rough half will have 3 in a row
13:49:32 <astrolabe> good point
13:49:49 <palomer> astrolabe: any idea how to do type inference with polymorphic recursion?
13:49:51 <tromp_> and 8 fold symmetry pushes it below 1000 L:)
13:50:02 <astrolabe> palomer: not a clue
13:50:10 <palomer> err, not polymorphic recursion
13:50:14 <palomer> with let polymorphism
13:50:27 <Philippa> lets introduce polymorphic types, lambdas don't
13:50:36 <Philippa> (IOW, you add the foralls to the types you infer in lets)
13:50:37 <palomer> yay for Philippa 
13:51:00 <palomer> Philippa: ok, what do you do with let polymorphism?
13:51:05 <palomer> Philippa: what kind of constraints do they generate?
13:51:09 <astrolabe> I assumed you'd count 3 in a rows, as long as the intersection of all 3iarows was a single point
13:51:14 <palomer> (if one was to solve the constraints after collecting them)
13:51:39 <Philippa> palomer: not done it in a constraint-based format
13:52:19 <palomer> ok, if one was to do it in-place
13:53:14 <Philippa> you got cardelli's paper on in-place H-M?
13:53:21 <Philippa> the tutorial one?
13:53:51 <tromp_> ok, let's write a haskell program to count tictactoe...
13:54:26 <jethr0> tromp_: i'm already doing it
13:54:36 <palomer> Philippa: I'll get it now
13:54:45 <jethr0> i'm writing an alpha-beta search and wanted to test it on tic-tac-toe
13:54:50 <Philippa> dates from 1988 IIRC
13:54:53 <astrolabe> Does anyone know that magic square thing?
13:54:54 <Philippa> I've forgotten the name
13:55:11 <astrolabe> alpha-beta won't count the positions
13:55:31 <jethr0> astrolabe: i'm doing alpha-beta on/in a lazy tree of all possible games
13:55:36 <vincenz> blegh
13:55:51 <vincenz> jethr0: for some reason the ruby goes up to like 70-90% cpu and >60% mem for several seconds
13:55:55 <vincenz> whenever I just ask the front page
13:56:04 <palomer> luca cardelli?
13:56:17 <jethr0> vincenz: that's bad. maybe it's initial startup and you can leverage sth with rubycgi
13:56:20 <astrolabe> jethr0: but I guess then that you are counting games rather than positions?
13:56:34 <jethr0> astrolabe: true
13:56:36 <vincenz> jethr0: who knows
13:56:54 <palomer> http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cardelli:Luca.html
13:56:54 <jethr0> but shouldn't you get #positions by dividing #games by sth sensible?
13:57:00 <astrolabe> tromp: good idea, but collaboration would be difficult.
13:57:16 <palomer> can't find anything on inference
13:57:17 <vincenz> time to try out a game inwindows
13:57:27 <tromp_> i get 4536 positions
13:57:30 <astrolabe> not unless sensible == something really complicated
13:57:30 <vincenz> I downloaded the one and only free 1st person 3d shooter made by the us army
13:57:38 <astrolabe> Wow that was quick
13:57:39 <vincenz> *grin*
13:57:46 <tromp_> not reducing for symmetries
13:57:51 <astrolabe> Ah
13:57:55 <tromp_> which is about what i guessed:)
13:57:58 <vincenz> maybe I oughta write a wiki written in haskell
13:58:00 <vincenz> or blog
13:58:05 <tromp_> half of half of 19683
13:58:08 <jethr0> vincenz: america's army is one of the few games availabe for linux :)
13:58:13 <astrolabe> tromp: Are you counting finished positions?
13:58:20 <palomer> Philippa: the papers from 1988 seem pretty irrelevant
13:58:21 <tromp_> no, unfinished
13:58:36 <vincenz> jethr0: this might interst you
13:58:40 <vincenz> jethr0: http://www.cs.uu.nl/~stefan/blog/00010.html
13:58:43 <tromp_> hmm, guess i shld cnt just-finished positions too
13:58:48 <vincenz> jethr0: yeah but it's an older version for linux, so I'll just reboot
13:58:52 <astrolabe> In that case, I can agree with <1000 and save my pride.
13:58:53 * vincenz dettaches
13:59:06 <palomer> ahh, 1987
14:01:12 <SyntaxNinja> hiya shapr
14:01:31 <Philippa> yeah, the revised version was 88
14:01:37 <Philippa> (just checked)
14:03:01 <palomer> hrm, what bothers me is that sometimes the type of the result of f depends on the type of the argument, and the type of the argument depends on the type of f
14:03:04 <palomer> like in
14:03:13 <palomer> @type \a -> let f (c::Int) = a in f a
14:03:17 <oasisbot> Int -> Int
14:03:25 <palomer> > 2+2
14:03:28 <oasisbot> 4
14:03:32 <tromp_> i get 5456 positions in all
14:04:04 <palomer> err, that the type of the result depends on a typevar that depends on f
14:04:09 <tromp_> 7 lines of haskell
14:04:18 <astrolabe> That's amazing
14:04:35 <astrolabe> Can you say which ply has the highest population?
14:04:47 <tromp_> not easily
14:04:53 <astrolabe> heh
14:04:59 <tromp_> well, actually, not hard
14:05:10 <tromp_> let me try to make a histogram
14:09:37 <tromp_> [(0,1),(1,9),(2,72),(3,252),(4,756),(5,1260),(6,1520),(7,1140),(8,390),(9,56),(10,0),(11,0),(12,0),(13,0),(14,0),(15,0),(16,0),(17,0),(18,0)]
14:10:10 <astrolabe> Cool!
14:10:17 <jethr0> hehe, moves beyond 9 are pretty hard, if one thinks about it :)
14:10:38 <palomer> superman could do it
14:10:51 <astrolabe> tromp: at this rate, a go program should take you no time at all.
14:11:01 <tromp_> go program require thought
14:11:23 <astrolabe> Aye, there's the rub
14:11:51 <astrolabe> thought is necessary but not sufficient in my experience.

14:34:12 <TuringTest> What's with the 'bot's name?
14:34:27 <dons> lambdabot's machine is having network trouble.
14:34:33 <dons> i'm attempting to solve it now, in fact.
14:35:13 <dibblego> can it be said that if a function consistently returns the same value forever irrespective of any arbitrary function, then it is monadic? 
14:35:36 <dons> no. it's a function :)0
14:35:56 <dibblego> that's what I thought
14:36:01 <TuringTest> hi dons.
14:36:01 <dons> monadic programming lets you pass state around. so that functions can return different values
14:36:04 <dons> i.e. getLine
14:36:19 <davidhouse> how exactly does that work, though?
14:36:46 <davidhouse> i don't see how returning IO (String) is any different from returning String, apart from you've got some things like >>= defined on the monadic one.
14:36:51 <dons> the key is to make sure that the functions are evaluated in the right order.
14:36:57 <davidhouse> unless there's also some hidden state or something in the monad...
14:37:00 <dibblego> then you could say it is non-monadic?
14:37:10 <dons> dibblego, you'd say it was pure
14:37:16 <TuringTest> davidhouse: IO String is really something like (\state -> ( String, state ) )
14:37:18 <dibblego> oh right
14:37:49 <dons> so in a monad we ensure ordering using the >>= abstraction which is roughly: let x = f in let y = g ... 
14:38:09 <dons> i.e. there's a sequencing happening. it's an abstraction over sequenced computation
14:38:39 <dons> i.e. imperative programming is just a special case of functional programming, where you thread all your state around.
14:39:48 <TuringTest> dibblego: And it turns out that there are other types that can be sequenced like monads, which do not resemble state.  Such as Maybe or List.
14:39:59 <dibblego> I really need to read up on this stuff
14:40:06 <dibblego> I've still only look for 10 or so minutes
14:40:56 <dons> yeah, having a sequential computation abstraction turns out to be really really powerful
14:41:14 <TuringTest> dibblego: I learned simply by reading all the tutorials and introductions on the web.  Most are linked from http://www.haskell.org/
14:41:18 <dibblego> well, I don't even know the basics of Haskell
14:41:30 <dibblego> TuringTest: I have it all bookmarked, but time is imperative :)
14:41:42 <TuringTest> So you have learned something.
14:41:44 <dons> @learn <-- some links to tutorials here
14:41:45 <oasisbot> Not enough privileges
14:41:49 <dons> grr.
14:42:04 <astrolabe> But you can't do IO with functional programming, so strictly, IO can't be a special case of functional.
14:42:29 <resiak> Any recommendations of modules to use for parsing s-expressions?
14:42:46 <TuringTest> resiak: Parsec?
14:42:50 <astrolabe> http://haskell.org/learning.html
14:42:52 <dons> you need some primops at least, astrolabe that return magic state tokens. that would be one way.
14:42:55 <davidhouse> does anyone know/can link me to the monadic definition of IO?
14:43:05 <dibblego> astrolabe: then do not you call C a functional language?
14:43:09 <davidhouse> i.e., the class instance decleration that says IO is an instance of Monad.
14:43:29 <astrolabe> dibblego: I'm not an expert, but I wouldn't, no.
14:43:39 <dibblego> ok
14:43:54 <dons> davidhouse, check the GHC.IOBase file in ghc''s darcs repository.
14:44:00 <dibblego> is a 'functional language' one where all functions are 'pure'?
14:44:02 <davidhouse> @where ghc
14:44:03 <oasisbot> http://haskell.org/ghc
14:44:23 <TuringTest> davidhouse: And you can see it in action at http://haskell.org/hawiki/KnucleotideEntry#head-dfcdad61d34153143175bb9f8237d87fe0813092
14:44:25 <astrolabe> functional means that the code is a set of (functional) relationships between things rather than a sequence of instructions.

14:45:45 <resiak> TuringTest: Thank you!
14:45:47 <dons> find the repo on haskell.org/ghc
14:45:52 <davidhouse> dons, i'm looking
14:46:05 <dons> look ing libraries/base/GHC/IOBase.hs
14:46:52 <dibblego> thanks for the pointers
14:47:17 <shapr> Ahem
14:47:20 <TuringTest> resiak: Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Combinator.between (char '(' ) (char ')' ) should come in handy for s-expressions.
14:47:23 <shapr> This is Haskell. We don't have pointers.
14:47:32 <davidhouse> do they even have a darcs repo?
14:47:35 <davidhouse> *does GHC

14:47:44 <resiak> TuringTest: You rock, thanks. I'll bear between in mind.
14:47:55 <Pseudonym> Thanks for the safe references!
14:48:14 <Pseudonym> Better?
14:48:48 <Pseudonym> And don't forget to clean up that cycle, shapr.
14:49:11 * shapr cleans his unicycle.

15:04:05 <UncleD-> Any ubuntu users here who use haskell on ubuntu?
15:05:06 <Saulzar> davidhouse, look under mutli line
15:05:33 <TuringTest> UncleD: I haven't, but what is the issue?
15:05:55 <davidhouse> Saulzar: a textview should do it. thanks.
15:07:04 <shapr> UncleD: Yeah, I use Debian, so maybe I can help.
15:08:41 <Cale> UncleD: I use Debian and my friend uses Ubuntu
15:09:58 <araujo> well... i don't want to insinuate anything... but.. ive heard the best Haskell support is for Gentoo

15:11:36 <UncleD> Ceal/shapr: I'm looking for an easy install for haskell
15:11:44 <UncleD> on ubuntu. Is there a proper apt-get?
15:11:46 <Cale> UncleD: it's in universe
15:11:50 <Cale> ghc6
15:11:56 <Cale> is the package name
15:12:11 <Cale> Breezy and up have the newest version
15:14:32 <UncleD> Does cygwin have a package too?
15:21:06 <UncleD> Cale: cygwin/package?
15:21:27 <davidhouse> dcoutts, ping
15:21:29 <TuringTest> I know GHC can be compiled using MSYS or Cygwin
15:22:02 <UncleD> k
15:22:05 <UncleD> I think i can manage.
15:22:26 <azuroth> there's an exercise in craft of functional programming to make all sublists of a list. is [2,3,4] a sublist of [2,3,4]?
15:23:14 <shapr> sub implies 'less than' to me...
15:23:27 <davidhouse> azuroth: the maths definition of subset (essentially the same thing): A subset B if forall a in A, a in B.
15:23:28 <davidhouse> so yes.
15:24:00 <TuringTest> azuroth: And [] is a sublist
15:24:53 * astrolabe agrees
15:25:00 <dcoutts> davidhouse, pong
15:25:15 <astrolabe> @type foldr
15:25:16 <oasisbot> forall b a. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
15:25:44 <dcoutts> davidhouse, see: http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/docs/current/Graphics-UI-Gtk-Entry-Entry.html
15:25:58 <davidhouse> dcoutts, where's the source to hIDE? I'm looking to build something with gtk2hs and i figure hIDE would be a good example as any
15:26:06 <dcoutts> @where hIDE
15:26:06 <azuroth> that's what I thought, except for the definition in the book
15:26:07 <oasisbot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
15:26:18 <davidhouse> ah. that was easy. :) sorry to ping you.
15:26:26 <dcoutts> davidhouse, ah, actually the repo jsut got relocated
15:26:56 <dcoutts> davidhouse, it might still be on scannedinavian.org but it's moving elsewhere, ask Lemmih 
15:27:09 <davidhouse> yeah, he's not around.
15:27:43 <davidhouse> looks to be still at http://scannedinavian.org/repos/hide/.
15:28:09 <azuroth> I guess the cleanest way to do it the book's, and shapr's, way would be to make the subsets, then remove the initial list from it?
15:28:26 <shapr> I'm just a programmer, feel free to ignore me :-)
15:28:48 <shapr> And I'm going to sleep too...
15:29:08 <dons> shapr, i've pull yi+gtk off scannedinavian. thanks for the heads up :)
15:29:18 <dcoutts> davidhouse, ok, but just to warn that it'll dissapear/move soon
15:29:30 <davidhouse> dcoutts, okay
15:29:31 <dcoutts> davidhouse, the other good reference is just the gtk2hs demos
15:29:43 <davidhouse> yeah
15:29:44 <shapr> dons: cool
15:29:48 <dcoutts> davidhouse, that's where I'd start
15:30:03 <dons> ah, lambdabot can connect from a different machine. very strange.

15:54:19 <davidhouse> hey all.
15:54:28 <dons> lambdabot: @yow
15:54:33 <davidhouse> i'm trying to abstract out my display code in a program i'm writing.
15:54:40 <lambdabot> Couldn't find fortune file
15:54:49 <TuringTest> davidhouse: Okay.
15:54:58 <dons> lambdabot: @version

15:54:59 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/lambdabot
15:55:04 <davidhouse> hmm... how to express this
15:55:46 <davidhouse> i want a structure (not sure if it should be a type, typeclass or something else) that i could create instances of, one for each possible method of display.
15:55:59 <TuringTest> davidhouse: Give two examples
15:56:38 <davidhouse> so i want to be able to say "given that you implement the methods output, input and displayPage, i'm willing to say you're a valid display module"
15:57:10 <davidhouse> examples: output to tty (output = putStrLn, input = getLine, displayPage is more complex) and output to GTK (all three are more complex)
15:57:26 <davidhouse> i thought creating a typeclass might be a good way to do this?
15:57:30 <TuringTest> davidhouse: A record storing some functions would be one solution.  
15:57:38 <davidhouse> record?
15:57:54 <TuringTest> Well, a data type with named elements
15:58:07 <davidhouse> oh, right.
15:58:14 <TuringTest> data Display = Display {output :: String -> IO (), ... }
15:58:47 <TuringTest> That lets you do interesting thing without a bunch of instance declarations.
15:59:01 <JKnecht> why did oasisbot replace lambdabot if it's not impolitic to ask?
15:59:03 <davidhouse> can that be parametrised? so can I say something like data Monad m => Display m = Display { output :: String -> m () ... }
15:59:15 <dons> JKnecht, lambdabot's machine had some difficulties.
15:59:19 <dons> it's coming back up now.
15:59:46 <dons> @yow
15:59:47 <oasisbot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
15:59:51 <TuringTest> davidhouse: Well, you may want MonadIO, but I expect so. 
15:59:58 <davidhouse> TuringTest: thanks
15:59:59 <JKnecht> now to be addressed by it's name?
16:00:03 <lambdabot> I'm not an Iranian!!  I voted for Dianne Feinstein!!

16:00:46 <TuringTest> davidhouse: For a very heavyweight approach, you could use HList or http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/OOHaskell/

16:04:38 <davidhouse> TuringTest: if i've defined a record like that, what's the syntax for creating one?
16:04:47 <beelsebob_> how do I find out what the admin commands for lambdabot are?
16:05:00 <dons> hmm. @listcommands :)
16:05:07 <beelsebob_> really?
16:05:08 <davidhouse> i would expect something like ttyout = Output { output = putStrLn ... } but that appears not to work
16:05:09 <TuringTest> davidhouse: let d = Display { output = putStrLn , ... }
16:05:09 <beelsebob_> oh... okay
16:05:21 <davidhouse> oh, perhaps the error was caused by something else then.
16:05:22 <dons> it's not well defiend. some require privs, some don't. but they're not partitioned in a clean way
16:05:42 <beelsebob_> oh, okay - why isn't quit listed?
16:05:59 <dons> oh, that's right. I think perhaps priv commands aren't listed in @listcommands
16:06:06 <dons> I seem to recall a patch along those lines
16:06:18 <Pseudonym> What's oasisbot?
16:06:35 <Pseudonym> Doesn't sound very pure to me.
16:06:43 <beelsebob_> hmm, so how do I find out what they are?
16:07:15 <Pseudonym> Who DOES have privs for oasisbot?
16:07:16 <dons> beelsebob_, hmm. read the Plugin src? Plugins/System.hs would be a start
16:07:24 <dons> I don't know. it just appeared..
16:07:33 <beelsebob_> hehe, okay
16:07:43 * dons checks the logs
16:07:47 * beelsebob_ makes the @listcommands admin command
16:08:00 <dons> good idea
16:08:00 <Pseudonym> Looks like lambdabot doesn't. :-)
16:08:15 <lambdabot>  @quit
16:08:22 <beelsebob_> :o
16:08:26 <Pseudonym> See?
16:08:34 <beelsebob_> why did lambdabot do that?
16:08:36 <Pseudonym> Oooh, robot wars!
16:08:44 <dons> ah, shapr is behind oasisbot.
16:08:48 <Pseudonym> Aj.

16:13:04 <Pseudonym> Oh, I didn't know there was a #meta-science.
16:13:11 <dons> seems like an older lambdabot, btw, vincenz. you might want to darcs pull

16:21:58 <dons> ah, my fault. fixing..
16:22:03 <Cale> it's not identified
16:22:32 <dons> how's that?
16:22:42 <tromp>  hoi
16:23:27 <Cale> well, /whois on it doesn't give the usual "lambdabot is identified with services"
16:23:39 <dons> i've identified it just then, and i can msg it now.
16:24:29 <dons> it says its identified now
16:26:00 <dons> it should autoidentify now. i'd forgotten to set the passwd file when moving homes.
16:29:48 <astrolabe> tromp:  I don't think your ttt code accepted end positions where more than one line was completed simultaneously.
16:30:07 <tromp> oh, right
16:30:18 <astrolabe> dons: thanks, that works.
16:30:32 <tromp> so i'd have to check intersections
16:31:15 <tromp> or find a possible last move
16:31:34 <astrolabe> Something like, if a line exists, then the intersection of all lines contains a point.
16:33:20 <astrolabe> So whether a line exists or not,      not (null (intersect lines))
16:35:12 <tromp> well, bedtime now. will think of a neat fix tomorrow:)
16:35:12 <tromp> g'night
16:36:09 <astrolabe> night from me too
16:49:29 <palomer> well, pierce shows how to do it in a constraint based format
16:55:46 <Philippa> where?
16:56:08 <Philippa> I don't recall the TaPL presentation being constraint-based, though it's been a while since I read the H-M chapter
17:09:47 <palomer> he outlines the steps
17:10:11 <palomer> the TaPL isn't very much anything based:o
17:10:41 <palomer> you take the type variable representing the rhs of the binding, then you generalize all the variables _not in the context_
17:26:29 <palomer> grr
17:26:40 <palomer> pottier removed many of his GADT examples from his miniGADT solver
17:26:42 <palomer> bastard:o!
17:31:14 <vincenz> dons: I don't get how you get lambdabot to compile with -Werror what with the multiple imports
17:32:02 <dons> you've got a borken ghc :)
17:32:07 <dons> it's fixed in ghc  6.4.1
17:32:25 <vincenz> ah
17:33:06 <dons> i bet you have 6.4, right?
17:33:50 <vincenz> yeah
17:34:54 <vincenz> dons: new lambdabot outputs a lot less to stdout?
17:35:55 <dons> should be half as much. though there's a buglet that means it doesn't output things addressed to it.
17:37:26 <vincenz> anyways, g'night
17:37:50 <resiak> Does anyone feel like explaining why "forall" is ever necessary?
17:38:57 <dons> for things like f :: (forall b. b->b) -> (forall b. b->b) -> Bool
17:39:26 <resiak> Surely the bs are unrestricted by default?
17:40:47 <dons> it's interesting all the different things with foralls that ghc does, check type-extensions.html section of the ghc users guide.
17:40:57 <dons> writing existentials is one I can thing of
17:41:22 <dons> rank-n polymorphism too.
17:41:31 <resiak> Okay, I'll have a read.
17:41:36 <Philippa> any time you're not doing rank-1 polymorphism, duh
17:42:09 <dons> like: data T a = T1 (forall b. b -> b -> b) a
17:44:02 <resiak> Hmm, I guess it's something I'll understand when I need it.
17:46:12 <dons> check section  7.4.9.Arbitrary-rank polymorphism
17:49:26 <resiak> Oh, I see. Thanks :-)
17:51:14 <jethr0_> man, i'm too dumb to program tic-tac-toe in reasonable time. how long am i supposed to take for othello or chess?

18:00:42 <Saulzar> dons, I might be dense but I've looked through the plugins paper and failed to see anything about filtering/rejecting unwanted code from a module (eg. unsafePerformIO)  - but would the Module -> Iface information be a good way to do it? It looks promising
18:01:13 <wolverian> can I encode a data type's field's length in the type system? i.e. only allow 3 < length < 5 etc.
18:01:14 <dons> hmm, don't we talk about merging files to control what imports are visible?
18:01:47 <Saulzar> I'll have another look :)
18:01:51 <wolverian> specifically, I'm modelling resistor colour bands, and metal and carbon resistors have a different amount of them
18:01:56 <dons> we take the code _source_, parse it, strip down the imports to only those we allow, and then compile it.
18:02:17 <wolverian> and I'd like to encode that in the type system.. I don't know if that actually makes sense in haskell, though
18:02:37 <dons> sounds cool. you could probably encode this in the type system yeah.
18:02:52 <dons> maybe forumlate exactly what you want to encode, and then ask on haskell-cafe@
18:03:06 <dons> someone will do some type-hackery, and you'll have your answer :)
18:03:22 <dons> so: what properties do you want to be true of your functions?
18:03:22 <wolverian> thanks :)
18:04:21 <wolverian> that's a hard question
18:07:02 <dons> the type system is a way to enforce properties statically. like "only X's can be used with this function" or "no array index will occur past the array bounds" or "this sort function is stable". maybe you don't have really strong properties to check, but just want to encode some data types to model resistors?
18:07:31 <wolverian> I have strong properties in the sense that "iff this transistor is made of carbon, it can have 3 to 6 bands"
18:07:36 <wolverian> s/iff/if/
18:07:44 <wolverian> I don't know if that's strong enough :)
18:07:56 <dons> data Resitor = Carbon3 | Carbon6 
18:08:05 <dons> or ,3 to 6.
18:08:52 <wolverian> that doesn't scale too well with the number of bands, at least in readability.. but yeah.
18:08:59 <wolverian> thanks :)
18:09:05 <dons> there are some other ways to encode the number checks in the constructors. 
18:09:12 <dons> a different way is to use 'smart constructors'
18:09:18 <wolverian> hm, sounds interesting
18:09:19 <dons> so just havve: data R = Carbon Int
18:09:28 <dons> then hide the constructor in the module export
18:09:55 <dons> and instead export a function:  new n | n >= 3 && n <= 6 = Carbon n | otherwise = error
18:10:06 <dons> so the only way to make a Carbon resistor is with 'new'
18:10:15 <wolverian> ah, yeah. thanks. that'll work
18:10:28 <dons> which then means if you ever see a Carbon, it'll be guaranteed to be in bounds, and you don't have to check 
18:10:56 <jethr0_> i just love it when you write code, unit test it, the test fails and after a long time of hand calculation you find out that the code was "righter" than you :)
18:17:01 <wolverian> gah, the band counts are actually overlapping between metal and carbon resistors
18:17:12 <wolverian> so I can't determine which one it is from the band count alone
18:17:40 <dons> data Zero ; data Succ a ; type One   = Succ Zero ; type Two   = Succ One; type Three = Succ Two; data Less; data Equal; data Greater; class Cmp x y c | x y -> c ; instance Cmp Zero Zero     Equal ; ... and then evenutally you write a function that has type f :: Carbon (And (Greater Two) (Less Seven)) -> Carbon (And (Greater Two) (Less Seven))  :) but maybe you don't need it all checked statically. having a few runtime chceks can make the types simpler :)
18:18:01 <wolverian> heh
18:18:28 <dons> it'd be a simpler version of this type-level quicksort: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/qs.transcript
18:18:36 <wolverian> it'd be nice if I could do: data Resistor = Carbon { bands :: 3 < [Band] < 6 } 
18:19:40 <wolverian> (the field being completely superfluous)
18:19:44 <dons> yeah, you'd need to encode < and nats in the type though since it's the typechecker that will do the check
18:20:20 <wolverian> mm. yeah. I'm not too used to a separate type checker.
18:20:40 <wolverian> (i.e. one where you can't run code to do a type check) 
18:24:43 <wolverian> let me reformulate that so I don't sound completely retarded: I'm not used to compile-time typechecking
18:24:57 <wolverian> it's 5am soon, sorry :)
18:26:11 <Saulzar> dons, Not specifically - but that looks like a good way of doing it. I guess it won't work here with users wanting to use arrow syntax
18:27:10 <jethr0_> wolverian: my guess would be that you're in the UK...
18:27:22 <jethr0_> coz' you're one hour ahead of me :)
18:27:52 <wolverian> UK is two hours behind me
18:28:10 <jethr0_> oh, i counted the wrong way, nm
18:36:54 <jethr0_> ||     Couldn't match the rigid variable `a' against `(a1, b)' `a' is bound by the instance declaration at useTic.hs|9| 0
18:36:57 <jethr0_> ||       Expected type: Tree (a1, b) b1
18:37:00 <jethr0_> ||       Inferred type: Tree a b2
18:37:00 <jethr0_> what does that mean?
18:37:49 <jethr0_> i did a "instance (Show a, Show b) => Show (Tree a b) where ..."
18:38:22 <jethr0_> and even tried substituting my pair for a data type, but the error remained
18:39:17 <jethr0_> ah, i think i found the problem...
18:42:22 <dons> wolverian, here's another idea: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/T.hs
18:42:56 <dons> in that one  we distinguish the kinds of resistors statically as well, so that you can't pass a metal resistor to a function expecting a carbon one.
18:43:18 <wolverian> dons, thanks! that's great
18:43:29 <dons> all fairly simple stuff. normal Haskell98.
18:43:44 <dons> the idea is just to push more and more informatoin into the type level.
18:44:03 <dons> (without resorting to full heavyweight encodings of logics)
18:44:49 <jethr0_> for this kind of thing, "inline modules" would be nice
18:46:40 <SamB> what in the world? type-level resistors?
18:51:17 <palomer> well, looks like I have to implement patterns now
18:51:36 <palomer> does everyone do things the way I do? (ie, figure out on your own, and not read the papers)?
18:52:12 <jethr0_> i've personally made very bad experience with implementing papers.
18:52:53 <jethr0_> some/many papers try to present their findings and results in a better light than reality does. and reimplementing an algo only to find out how shabby it is, can be quite demotivating
18:57:33 <palomer> so just go with your gut feelings?
18:58:32 <jethr0_> palomer: are you asking my advice?
18:59:07 <lispy> if you're a grad student or a researcher you should be reading lots of papers whether you follow them in your implementations or not
19:00:01 <jethr0_> very true. if you look in the right places, there are very neat ideas and insights in most papers
19:00:32 <jethr0_> just don't be blinded by the promises of saving the worlds oldest problems in two sentences
19:00:47 <lispy> heh, yeah those the the papers to be really afraid of
19:01:23 <jethr0_> lispy: true, but in my experience most papers exaggerate their results by quite a broad margin
19:01:49 <lispy> sometimes a modest paper is much better than an ambitious one.  in my experience, when a paper sets out to change the world, you should watch for follow up research where they discuss the real problems with their theory/framework
19:02:21 <jethr0_> if you're lucky, it says in fine print in the conclusion "all the above was done on a single synthetic test data set, without noise and some interactive help"
19:02:41 <lispy> jethr0_: yeah, you HAVE to publish often in research so there is a lot of pressure to publish bs and over exaggerate
19:03:16 <yome> Talking about papers, I've just read "Composable Memory Transactions", and I have trouble getting over how cool it is.
19:03:19 <jethr0_> the big moment has come. will my lazy-tree alpha-beta search be able to solve tic-tac-toe *gg*
19:03:39 <lispy> palomer: one thing you can do is findout the acceptance rate at the conference the paper was published in that will give you an idea for how impressed the experts in that field were
19:04:20 <lispy> palomer: and a journal paper or tech report will probably be better than a conference paper if you're trying to extract an implementation from the literature
19:04:25 <dons> yome, it's pretty cool :)
19:04:40 <yome> dons, indeed.  It's very, very well written.  Very understandable.
19:05:36 <lispy> yome: on the subject of papers.  Somehing from my own experience as an author, sometimes an understandable paper just hides the rough spots ;)
19:05:52 <yome> lispy, have you read that particular one?
19:05:54 <lispy> but that might not apply here :)
19:05:57 <lispy> nope
19:06:03 <yome> I don't think it does.  It's a must-read.
19:06:14 * jethr0_ was a bit scared by the title and put it off till later
19:06:32 <yome> jethr0_, I'm a Schemer, and I found it very easy to read.
19:07:35 <yome> "I'm a Schemer", meaning I'm not used to static type systems.
19:07:59 <yome> There's even a concise explanations of monads that made it all clear why they were very useful and desirable in that context.
19:08:05 <yome> Makes me jealous a bit.
19:08:05 <jethr0_> ya, i'll have a look at it. but chances are, it's gonna boggle my mind
19:08:59 <yome> lispy, got any links to your paper(s)?
19:12:38 <yome> nm, I think I found them.
19:13:09 <palomer> hrmph
19:13:17 <palomer> I think I'll like the wobbly type paper better
19:13:43 <lispy> yome: nope, i've only written one that will be published and the journal won't let me put it on my website
19:14:06 <yome> lispy, can you tell me the title?
19:14:14 <yome> ... or what is it about?
19:14:21 <dons> really, they explicitly prevent you?
19:14:36 <lispy> dons: it's an elsiver(sp?) journal
19:14:48 <lispy> yome: it's not yet published, it's accepted but still getting reviewed
19:15:19 <lispy> dons: have you read Knuth's letter to the directors of his algorithms journal?
19:15:52 <lispy> dons: the publisher of the journal we were accepted to is one he mentions.  so it's possible they changed their policy
19:16:45 <lispy> let's see if i can find a link
19:17:01 <yome> lispy, so you can't give either the title or what it's about?
19:18:08 <lispy> dons: this blog has a link and a summary http://www.tomkeays.com/blog/archives/2004/03/01/000117.php
19:18:19 <lispy> yome: oh sorry, got side tracked
19:18:39 <lispy> yome: it's called "Cognitive Dimensions: Advice from the trenches"  it's about HCI
19:19:16 <lispy> yome: the reviewers liked it because my advisor word smithed it so that we carefully avoid dicussion of any of our rough spots or weaknesses of the paper :)
19:19:40 <yome> lispy, http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~dagit/cdpaper.pdf
19:20:15 <lispy> hehe
19:20:27 <lispy> yome: yeah, i was going to /msg you a link to that, i think that one is old
19:20:45 <lispy> either way now that it's been accepted i was going to take it down
19:20:48 <lispy> just in case
19:42:15 <lispy> yome: sounds like super typing in C++ would help their development
19:42:25 <lispy> yome: refering to that sweeny paper
19:42:44 <yome> What's "super typing" ?
19:48:22 <lispy> yome: http://repetae.net/john/recent/out/supertyping.html
19:48:36 <lispy> it's a neat idea, but i don't know any implementation in haskell
19:50:10 <palomer> hrmph
19:50:19 <palomer> how do you deal with mutually recursive definitions, type-wise?
19:50:40 <palomer> just add them both to your context?
19:53:40 <palomer> nevermind
19:58:02 * palomer sometimes gets kind errors which should really be type errors
20:12:06 <palomer> hrm
20:12:14 <palomer> can lift screw up my exception throwing?
20:12:19 <palomer> @hoogle liftM

20:12:29 <palomer> > Control.Monad.liftM $ error "hi"
20:12:30 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Show (m a1 -> m r))
20:12:34 <palomer> ??
20:13:33 <mauke> makes sense
20:13:43 <mauke> error has any type and the result of liftM is a function
20:18:39 <dons> maybe you want: const $ error "hi"?
20:20:04 <dons> > let hrmph = error in hrmph "hrmph"
20:20:05 <lambdabot> Add a type signature
20:20:16 <dons> hrmph.
20:23:59 <palomer> looks like I started a trend
20:30:55 <palomer> ok, I have this code:
20:31:00 <palomer> liftM $ foo
20:31:04 <palomer> and I know foo throws an error
20:31:10 <palomer> and I want the error to propagate
20:31:12 <palomer> how do I do this?
20:32:32 <palomer> rather, liftM $ foo bar
20:33:16 <palomer> ahh, found the mistake
20:33:20 <palomer> was returning the error!
20:41:38 <palomer> > foldl1 (+) [1]
20:41:39 <lambdabot> 1
20:47:30 <jethr0_> writing AIs even for simple games is _far_ harder than i would have thought
20:48:44 <SamB> jethr0_: you probably hadn't thought enough ;-)
20:49:02 <jethr0_> well, my heuristic for tic-tac-toe didn't account for the element of time ;)
20:49:11 <SamB> jethr0_: anyway, what do you think is meant by "simple"
20:49:46 <jethr0_> huh?
20:50:26 <SamB> maybe it is easier to make them for video games ;-)
20:50:58 <SamB> especially the kind with hordes of bad guys
20:51:08 <SamB> because then the bad guys can be stupid
20:51:37 <jethr0_> ah, that's how it works :)
20:51:59 <jethr0_> seriously though. evaluating a position of tic-tac-toe is far less trivial than i had thought :)
20:52:16 <jethr0_> _plus_ i seem to be even more stupid than usual after 5am
20:52:31 <SamB> hahaahahhah
20:52:40 <palomer> who here thinks that ghc needs better error messages?
20:53:18 <jethr0_>  palomer: compared to e.g. g++ STL error messages, ghc is heaven. but sometimes i think ghc knows exactly what the problem is and just conveys it in a cryptic fashion
20:53:26 <jethr0_> SamB: haha, very funny
20:53:39 <palomer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/0Bcsjl40.html
20:54:36 <jethr0_> you are giving one of the function one argument too few
20:54:54 <palomer> all my functions have a single argument
20:55:13 <jethr0_> and all those parens make me all itchy. ++ binds very losely
20:55:45 <palomer> I like to group things that clearly belong together
20:55:54 <palomer> showTerm (Var x _) = x
20:55:58 <jethr0_> your args to foldl are wrong way around
20:55:58 <palomer> showParameter (ParameterVar s _) = s
20:56:08 <jethr0_> foldl function start elements
20:56:28 <palomer> yeah, that's the right way
20:56:39 <jethr0_> sry, i'm too tired already
20:57:04 <palomer> ditto
20:57:08 <jethr0_> and i was talking about the parens in the error msg, sry^2
20:57:14 <palomer> oh, I'm an idiot
20:58:12 <jethr0_> oh, [""] and bindings don't have the same type
20:58:19 <jethr0_> therefore the second step of foldl fails
20:58:35 <palomer> well, erm, the function should take 2 argument
20:58:37 <palomer> mine takes 1

20:59:57 <jethr0_> a string is a list
21:00:18 <palomer> foldl1 (++) $ map showBinding bindings
21:00:25 <palomer> oh, you're right

21:01:02 <palomer> but concat is too general

21:07:00 <jethr0_> ah, 9 elements! i counted less
21:07:51 <palomer> List really rocks
21:08:21 <jethr0_> my favorite is still tricks with sequence

21:16:19 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `$'
21:16:27 <palomer> how is that getting misparsed?
21:16:36 <jethr0_> $ is syntactic sugar for parens
21:16:45 <jethr0_> a $ b = a (b)
21:16:57 <Cale> not quite
21:17:04 <jethr0_> no, it's application, right?
21:17:06 <Cale> well, that equation is true
21:17:10 <Cale> a $ b = a b
21:17:22 <Lemmih> palomer: Same reason '+ +' is a parse error.
21:18:03 <palomer> but in this case it makes sense!
21:18:04 <jethr0_> i've been using this patter "f . g . h $ x" often lately
21:18:11 <palomer> > map (((+1) $) $) [0,1]
21:18:12 <lambdabot> [1,2]
21:18:13 <jethr0_> is there a nice version without "$"?
21:18:29 <palomer> isn't $ left associative?

21:18:53 <jethr0_> @pl f $ g $ h
21:18:54 <lambdabot> f (g h)
21:19:07 <jethr0_> Lemmih: ah right, i always forget about that :)
21:19:39 <palomer> parens should be avoided at all costs!
21:19:46 <palomer> what are we? schemers?
21:20:31 <jethr0_> (define (function a b) (+ (* a 2) (/ b 3)))
21:20:49 <jethr0_> i must say prefix notation has its merits.
21:21:14 <jethr0_> like writing (/ 3 4 5 6 7)   or   (< 7 3 5 2)
21:21:21 <jethr0_> it's like a weird version of mixfix
21:21:49 <jethr0_> anyone know if n-ary division is supported in lisp/scheme?
21:22:32 <palomer> insertAll x m = foldl (\m (y,z) -> M.insert y z m) m x  <--quick, someone shorten this!
21:22:34 <jethr0_> i just checked. (/ 3 4 5) = 3/20
21:23:02 <jethr0_> @pl \x m = foldl (\m (y,z) -> M.insert y z m) m x
21:23:03 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 6):
21:23:03 <lambdabot> unexpected "="
21:23:03 <lambdabot> expecting pattern or "->"
21:23:19 <jethr0_> @pl \x m ->= foldl (\m (y,z) -> M.insert y z m) m x
21:23:20 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 8):
21:23:20 <lambdabot> unexpected "="
21:23:20 <lambdabot> expecting lambda abstraction or expression
21:23:22 <jethr0_> @pl \x m -> foldl (\m (y,z) -> M.insert y z m) m x
21:23:23 <lambdabot> flip (foldl (const (uncurry (((M .) .) . (flip =<< insert)))))
21:24:19 <jethr0_> insertAll = flip $ foldl (\x (y,z) -> M.insert y z m)
21:25:20 <palomer> I remember lennart did a really short version
21:25:32 <jethr0_> insertAll = flip $ foldl (\(y,z) -> flip $ M.insert y z)
21:25:55 <jethr0_> insertAll = flip $ foldl (uncurry $ flip $ M.insert)
21:26:19 <palomer> why the first flip?
21:26:37 <jethr0_> because arg order is "x m" and application order in foldl is "m x"
21:27:20 <palomer> but you're flipping the first arguments!
21:27:46 <jethr0_> ah, sorry
21:28:23 <palomer> @type flip (+)
21:28:24 <lambdabot> forall b. (Num b) => b -> b -> b
21:28:27 <palomer> @type flip (+1)
21:28:28 <lambdabot> forall b c. (Num (b -> c)) => b -> (b -> c) -> c
21:28:43 <palomer> @type flip id
21:28:44 <lambdabot> forall b c. b -> (b -> c) -> c
21:28:55 <palomer> what in the blazes?
21:29:00 <jethr0_> take a binary function
21:29:17 <jethr0_> flip (>) 3 4
21:29:21 <jethr0_> > flip (>) 3 4
21:29:22 <lambdabot> True
21:30:28 <palomer> yeah
21:30:34 <palomer> but unary doesn't make sense
21:31:09 <Saulzar> @type flip $ foldl (uncurry $ flip $ M.insert)
21:31:10 <lambdabot> Couldn't find qualified module.
21:31:10 <lambdabot> Maybe you're using the wrong syntax: Data.List.(\\) instead of (Data.List.
21:31:10 <lambdabot> \\)?
21:31:47 <jethr0_> no, flip on trinary functions is really evil. that was just wrong ;(
21:32:04 <Saulzar> foldr (uncurry M.insert) 
21:32:12 <palomer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/QHq1Oc26.html <--ehh?
21:33:16 <jethr0_> wouldn't foldl... take 3 args?
21:33:27 <dons> yeah, remembering that foldl and foldr flip args is good 
21:33:37 <jethr0_> @hoogle foldlM1_
21:33:38 <lambdabot> No matches found
21:33:44 <dons> foldM1_ !!?
21:33:46 <dons> crazy man
21:33:47 <jethr0_> dons: how do you mean?
21:33:48 <palomer> foldlM1_ =  (\f (x:xs) -> Control.Monad.foldM_ f x xs)
21:33:53 <dons> @type foldl
21:33:53 <palomer> dons: how is that crazy?
21:33:54 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
21:33:57 <dons> @type foldr
21:33:57 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
21:34:16 <palomer> but the problem isn't the foldlM1_
21:34:38 <jethr0_> palomer: you've got mismatching monads somewhere
21:34:47 <dons> well, it is crazy: an 'l' suffix, an 'M' suffix, a '1' suffix and a '_' . way too much info encoded in the identifier ;)
21:35:19 <Saulzar> m_phszFoldlM1_'
21:35:35 <jethr0_> hehe
21:36:10 <jethr0_> let's shorten Foldl c/unix-style and use underscores more: m_phsz_fldlm1_
21:36:13 <dons> oh yeah, it should be strict too
21:36:15 <dons> so add '
21:36:31 <dons> foldl1M_' 
21:36:41 <Saulzar> Hungarian notation is important too, since type signatures are too verbose
21:36:47 <palomer> my monads are fine!
21:36:48 <dons> who needs a type system. just do it with ident suffixes
21:36:52 <Saulzar> Right.
21:36:54 <dons> works for perl
21:37:17 <palomer> let's do it with greek letters
21:37:19 <palomer> all together now
21:37:31 <jethr0_> i liked the comment by ritchie (or kernigan, not sure), that if you could change one thing it would be to spend one more character for the "creat" call :)
21:37:46 <Saulzar> Hmm, wow - hungarian notation for function types could be a joy
21:38:02 <dons> fa->b ?
21:38:31 <palomer> @hoogle mapM
21:38:32 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
21:38:32 <lambdabot> Prelude.mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
21:38:32 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.mapM_ :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m ()
21:38:51 <Saulzar> jethr0_, Haha.. really bad abreviation.
21:38:59 <palomer> hrmphrmaoruchaoeustnahou , noone have any idea?
21:41:22 <palomer> god damnit, I've been programming in haskell long enough not to get puzzled by type errors!
21:43:43 <Saulzar> Hmm, in fact - just adopt GHC core naming system, add hungarian notation for types
21:44:07 <dons> and the Z encoding. we need that
21:44:12 <dons> Mzifoo for M.foo
21:44:26 <dons> IntZh for Int#
21:44:57 <palomer> seriously guys, don't code while sleepy
21:45:09 <Saulzar> That's the best time
21:45:18 <palomer> it's fun
21:45:21 <palomer> but you get nothing done
21:48:24 <palomer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/0aO9E948.html
21:50:32 <palomer> oh, I have to lift
21:50:33 <palomer> grr
21:54:14 <palomer> omg, working in monad transformers hurts my brain
21:54:23 <jethr0_> good night
21:54:43 <palomer> going to bed?
21:55:08 <jethr0_> maybe you should to. if you're one hour ahead of me, it 8am already for you :)
21:55:19 <jethr0_> sleep well (hopefully sometime), bye
21:55:27 <dons> @localtime  palomer
21:55:30 <lambdabot> Local time for palomer is Fri Feb 17 00:56:17
21:55:49 <jethr0_> huh, i must be mixing you up with someone else
21:55:55 <dons> and you wonder why the monad transformers are hurting. you're not supposed to use them after midnight..
21:56:04 <dons> or  you turn into a type-level pumpkin
21:56:36 <palomer> oh no!
22:21:38 <mwc> Wow, I am so psyched for GHC 6.6
22:21:51 <mwc> true multitrheaded concurrent haskell!
22:22:36 <dons> BRING IT ON!!
22:22:44 <sieni> from which package should "runhaskell" come from?
22:23:00 <mwc> ah, no, just looks like it's gonna be parallel haskell. Still cool though
22:23:01 <dons> package? it's installed with all haskell compilers and interpreters, iirc
22:23:13 <dons> mwc, we don't get an smp rts?
22:23:16 <dons> I think we do.
22:23:22 <mwc> Especially since I just got access to a 1068 core CPU
22:23:26 <mwc> er, cluster
22:23:38 <dons> oh. I was about to faint.
22:23:54 <mwc> yeah, still, 1068/2 dual core opterons should be fun
22:24:13 <dons> i have fun with 20 p4's in a cluster, so I can imagine 1k would be fun :)
22:24:26 <dons> we could have lambdabot battles!
22:24:39 <mwc> Oh, dons, you are write:
22:24:40 <yome> So, where's Distributed Haskell?
22:24:40 <mwc> Concurrent threads (forkIO and forkOS) will run in parallel, and you can also use the par combinator and Strategies from the Control.Parallel.Strategies module to create parallelism.
22:24:46 <mwc> I read that as "will not run in parallel'
22:25:33 <sieni> so the person who packages ghc (6.2) for fink has decided that this runhaskell thing should be forgotten
22:25:43 <mwc> sieni, use darwinports for all things haskell
22:26:01 <sieni> maybe I'll just buy a pc
22:26:08 <mwc> I think that ghc 6.2 doesn't have cabal, and so runhaskell wasn't there 
22:26:29 <sieni> I'd rather compile the things manually than use darwinports
22:26:54 <mwc> to each his own
22:27:35 <dons> sieni, no, it only appeared with 6.4
22:27:48 <dons> you'd have to compile Setup.hs by hand (which is ok)
22:27:52 <dons> ghc -o setup Setup.hs
22:28:01 <dons> but with 6.2 you'll also need to install Cabal.
22:28:23 <sieni> ok, I'll install newer ghc
22:30:33 <dons> does anyone know if we can get syntax highlighting on the new wiki?
22:33:43 <mwc> new wiki?
22:33:50 <mwc> hawiki looks the same to me
22:35:19 <mwc> or is it a secret wiki :(
22:36:44 <Speck> haskell.org
22:36:48 <Speck> the new wiki :-)
22:38:02 <mwc> Wow
22:38:06 <mwc> I hadn't even noticed
22:38:08 <mwc> what wiki engine?
22:38:31 <mwc> MediaWiki
22:38:38 <mwc> finally found the version page
22:57:33 <dons> yeah, the haskellwiki, not hawiki
23:11:11 <requalix> !say stuff
23:11:14 <requalix> (no bots?)
23:15:06 <cpatrick> > reverse "requalix"
23:15:07 <lambdabot> "xilauqer"
23:16:05 <requalix> :)
23:16:08 <requalix> > help
23:16:09 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `help'
23:16:12 <requalix> gah
23:16:20 <requalix> > say stuff ?
23:16:20 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `}'
23:16:29 <requalix> > say "stuff"
23:16:30 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `say'
23:16:54 <requalix> oh, it has a syntax
23:16:55 <requalix> cool
23:17:03 <cpatrick> it evaluates haskell code
23:19:57 * requalix learns more haskell =P
23:21:02 <cpatrick> yes. learn haskell!
23:46:28 <dons> @yow
23:46:29 <lambdabot> I didn't order any WOO-WOO ... Maybe a YUBBA ... But no WOO-WOO!
23:57:30 <Saulzar> Hmm, does the posix resource limits thing work for OS threads or only processes?
23:59:36 <dons> hmm. i don't think they're gong to work per-thread, specially not per haskell thread
