01:28:58 <wolverian> hm. Helium has very nice error messages.
01:31:19 <dons> it would be a nice project to port some of the Helium infrastructure across to GHC's error message code
01:32:26 <pejo> dons, isn't the main reason Helium can produce a lot of the good error messages because their type system is weaker?
01:33:30 <pejo> (No type class support).
01:33:38 <dons> yes, possibly that's the main reason
01:33:59 <dons> but i suspect that maybe the error messages are just better thought out too, which would be portable
01:34:03 <dons> maybe i'm totally wrong
01:37:19 <pejo> Maybe. It definitely is an area in need of attention, but not as glorious as many others I guess. :-)
01:39:20 <eivuokko> I suspect there's not enough user feedback as well.
01:39:47 <eivuokko> Simons seem fairly responsive to fixing single bad error messages.
01:43:41 <benja_> it would be nice if failing pattern matches would show the data that failed to match (for showable types)...
01:46:43 <pejo> eivuokko, nods. The "clear text explaination" of Helium is probably very good for beginners, but to get it really good you probably need loads of data (like they get from their functional programming class where they logged information :)

02:48:18 <wolverian> sieni, that isn't utf8, is it?
02:48:40 <ricky_clarkson> Latin-1.
02:48:42 <dons> latin1?
02:48:46 <sieni> of course not, iso latin 1 or latin 9
02:48:57 <wolverian> that's why I saw ?s, then :)
02:49:03 <ricky_clarkson> Only non-English speakers know of more than 2 encodings.
02:49:28 <wolverian> that's why I'm disappointed it was from sieni..
02:50:14 <kzm> Umm.. I get a bunch of haddock warnings, about not being able to resolve some names.  Imports from prelude etc, it seems.
02:50:26 <sieni> some finnish ircers organized a "let's move to wtf-8" day, so as a protest I keep using iso latin 9
02:50:31 <kzm> Should I worry about this?  Or is it normal?  Both?  neither?
02:50:36 <dons> normal, I think
02:50:40 <dons> haddock is noisy
02:50:53 <kzm> Okay.  I seem to get the output I want, so...
02:51:16 <kzm> My makefile is twice its original size to transform .lhs and -cpp to something haddock will accept :-)
02:51:28 <dons> you can't use Cabal?
02:51:35 <ricky_clarkson> sieni: I believe the old quoted reason is that mIRC doesn't support UTF-8, but I think that's changed.
02:51:40 <dons> or does cabal not know how to unlit and haddockise .lhs?
02:51:55 <wolverian> sieni, yeah. I use iso88591 on most of the finnish channels, still.
02:52:21 <ricky_clarkson> sieni: I just use Latin-1 because putty defaults to it, but it's easy to switch during a session.
02:52:31 <sieni> well iso-8859-1 is crappy since it doesn't support all Finnish characters, namely s and z with carons
02:52:38 <kzm> I didn't know cabal could build haddock-docs(!)
02:52:51 <kzm> Can it?  Can I?
02:52:54 <dons> ./Setup.hs haddock
02:53:02 <wolverian> sieni, you know, I didn't think anyone used them anymore :)
02:53:03 <kzm> (now he tells me!  (sigh))
02:53:05 <kzm> :-)
02:53:14 <dons> you didn't ask!
02:53:39 <kzm> Hehe.  And I learned a few 'make' tricks.
02:53:47 <dons> well, isn't Cabal just that much more special now you've written it in make? :)

02:54:24 <kzm> And I know why it is so hard to find good examples of generating haddock from make.
02:54:40 <dons> hehe. there was an example in yi' 0.1.0's build system

06:22:12 <roconnor> why isn't unbox-strict-fields enabled by default?
06:22:27 <Ulfalizer> what does it do?
06:23:03 <roconnor> I'm not sure.  I guess it puts strict fields right into the record as opposed to having a pointer.
06:23:33 <mux> to the best of my knowledge, the box is some amount of memory used to store meta-data information about some value
06:23:35 <xerox> I am not sure about a behavior
06:23:42 <xerox> Should cabal-install tell you you can't install if you are not root?
06:23:45 <mux> given that some value may be _|_ etc
06:24:02 <mux> for strict fields it doesn't make sense to keep the box along
06:24:09 <xerox> Now it downloads and compiles the package, and dies with an exception when trying to installing it.
06:24:10 <mux> so it's an optimization
06:24:30 <roconnor> yes, but it seems like an optimization that ought to come with -O.
06:24:50 <roconnor> ... maybe it does come with -O?
06:25:06 <roconnor> but everyone seems to like adding the pragma to their source files.
06:25:45 <Ed-E> Hi - I am a haskell Newbie wondering if someone could help me with something...
06:25:57 <xerox> Sure, ask
06:26:20 <Ed-E> I am using winHugs version may 2006. and it just ignores the \n newline command
06:26:46 <Ed-E> either when it is in a program I have written or just type "hello\nhello" into the prompt for example
06:27:06 <Ed-E> its just prints "hello\nhello" instead of putting a newline in
06:27:13 <ricky_clarkson> > "hello\nhello"
06:27:15 <lambdabot>  "hello\nhello"
06:27:24 <xerox> > showString "hello\nhello"
06:27:25 <lambdabot>  <[Char] -> [Char]>
06:27:27 <xerox> > showString "hello\nhello" ""
06:27:28 <lambdabot>  "hello\nhello"
06:27:29 <xs> putStrLn "hello\nhello"?
06:27:35 <xerox> > words "hello\nhello"
06:27:36 <lambdabot>  ["hello","hello"]
06:27:47 <roconnor> Ed-E are you using putStr, or print?
06:27:51 <Lemmih> Ed-E: Use 'putStrLn'.
06:28:08 <ricky_clarkson> That works, yes.
06:28:13 * ricky_clarkson is using the same.
06:28:46 <Ed-E> how do I 'use' putStrLn?
06:28:55 <Ed-E> sorry for being a spack
06:29:02 <roconnor> If you use print, you get "hello\nhello", if you use putStr, you get hello(newline)hello.
06:29:15 <Ed-E> how do I change it?
06:29:17 <roconnor> putStr "hello\nhello"
06:29:33 <Ed-E> ah ok so if you dont put anything in it assumes you mean print?
06:29:40 <roconnor> right
06:29:50 <Ed-E> wicked. thanks a lot!
06:32:58 <tibbe> um, how could I write partitionM_ ?
06:33:55 <tibbe> or rather, partitionM
06:34:08 <mux> heh, I was going to say partitionM >> return ())
06:34:11 <mux> -)
06:34:17 <tibbe> :p
06:34:34 <tibbe> ?type mapM
06:34:35 <lambdabot> forall b (m :: * -> *) a. (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
06:34:57 <mux> I'm trying to understand what would partitionM do
06:35:02 <mux> it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
06:35:41 * tibbe doesn't know either
06:35:48 <mux> why would you want it then? :)
06:35:58 <tibbe> I'm trying to get my head around a recursive monadic function
06:36:16 <tibbe> I'm writing a recursive version of getDirectoryContents
06:36:47 <mux> hmmm..
06:36:51 <mux> or hmmmM_
06:36:51 <tibbe> btw, is there an idiomatic naming scheme for function that returns recursive "results"?
06:36:58 <tibbe> :D
06:37:31 <mux> the only think I know about recursive monadic computations is that it has to do with the MonadFix class
06:38:03 <tibbe> I used filterM to get all the nested dirs but I need to combine files and dirs so I need (files, dirs) rather than (files + dirs, dirs)
06:38:08 <mux> probably not necessarily though
06:38:19 <mux> I used to write some simple recursive functions that were IO computations
06:38:24 * tibbe doesn't know what MonadFix is
06:38:31 <mux> and I wasn't doing anything special at all
06:38:38 <xerox> tibbe: I have it in cabal-install if you want
06:38:47 <xerox> tibbe: it returns a Data.Tree.Forest.
06:39:04 <tibbe> xerox, I was writing it for cabal-uninstall ;)
06:39:14 <xerox> Check cabal-install code then :)
06:39:16 <tibbe> or rather a prototype
06:39:21 <tibbe> :)
06:39:52 <xerox> listPackages
06:40:06 <xerox> in Network/Hackage/Client.hs
06:40:08 <tibbe> :)
06:40:26 * roconnor needs to finish his article of a case study of mdo.
06:40:32 <tibbe> hmm, I need something ordered so nested dirs/files appear before their parents
06:40:57 <tibbe> so I can remove children first, check if the dir is empty and if so remove the parent
06:41:09 <xerox> It is a Tree!
06:41:11 <xerox> It returns a Tree :)
06:41:28 <tibbe> and it is ordered the way I want it to be?
06:41:38 <xerox> It has the order that the directories have
06:41:50 <xerox> I.e. it maps the fs to a Data.Tree
06:42:10 <tibbe> so the order that "ls" returns?
06:42:37 <Ed-E> Sorry am back.... So how would I make this work?
06:42:38 <Ed-E> test :: String->String
06:42:45 <tibbe> actually it would be enough if all dirs come before the files in the ordering
06:42:46 <Ed-E> test n =  n++ "\n" ++ n ++ "\n" ++ n
06:43:04 <Ed-E> with the putStr bit?
06:43:18 <tibbe> > let test n =  n++ "\n" ++ n ++ "\n" ++ n in test "hi"
06:43:19 <lambdabot>  "hi\nhi\nhi"
06:43:33 <tibbe> > let test n =  n++ "\n" ++ n ++ "\n" ++ n in putStr $ test "hi"
06:43:34 <lambdabot>  No IO allowed
06:43:51 <xerox> How do I find in which package a module is?
06:43:52 <ulfdoz> muahahaha!
06:43:56 <ulfdoz> ECHAN, sorry
06:44:05 <Ed-E> haven't got to i/o yet
06:46:36 <Ed-E> it just says in my lecture notes and in my textbook that "\n" should make a new line...why is it suddenly so complicated?
06:47:19 <Lemmih> It /does/ make a newline. How you display that newline is a different matter, tho.
06:47:23 <ricky_clarkson> It does make a new line, but .. yeah.
06:47:44 <ricky_clarkson> Haskell's obviously too popular if lecturers are using it.
06:47:48 <Ed-E> so is there an easy way to make it display "\n" as a new line every time i use it?
06:47:53 <roconnor> Ed-E: printing a string escapes things line newlines and quote marks, etc.
06:48:23 <Lemmih> Ed-E: Just use 'putStrLn'.
06:48:24 <roconnor> Ed-E: In order to show a string on the display you need to do IO.
06:48:45 <roconnor> So use putStr (or putStrLn) every time you want to display your strings.
06:49:51 <araujo> hello
06:49:52 <Ed-E> so in that example i gave above it would be test n = n ++ putStr "\n" ++ n ++ putStr "\n" ++ n??
06:50:04 <araujo> no
06:50:14 <araujo> @type putStr
06:50:15 <lambdabot> String -> IO ()
06:51:11 <araujo> Concatenate and then do the printing.
06:51:26 * araujo finishing a script to use ghci as a shell
06:51:58 <Lemmih> Ed-E: putStrLn (test "hello world")
06:52:27 <sieni> let test n = putStr (n ++ "\n" ++ n ++ "\n" ++ n) in test "hello world"
06:52:30 <sieni> or something
06:52:48 <Ed-E> okay I think I get it...i'll go play around with that. Cheers for your help
06:53:19 * roconnor tries to remember how long it took to grok IO.
06:53:53 <kzm> Anybody know what the "Coverage Condition" is (for functional deps)?
06:57:26 <araujo> Best way to grasp at IO is to think of it as a container imho.
06:58:10 <araujo> One way container, whatever it gets in, it can't go out of it.
06:58:23 <ookk> how long and how many values of an evaluated function does haskell store?
06:59:33 <dons> |-------------------------| this long
06:59:42 <ookk> for instance if i have calculated fac 10000 does it store the values of fac 1-9999
07:00:01 <ookk> so you cant rely on it?
07:00:02 <dons> most likely no
07:00:28 <dons> values are produced and consumed on demand
07:00:37 <ookk> so then it is better to make a list of values if the speed on your algorithm relies on previously evaluated values
07:00:41 <roconnor> ookk: it is compiler specific.  If you memoize using lists, then you it will definitely be stored.
07:01:00 <ookk> so i guess i have to do it explicitly
07:01:03 <ookk> with a list
07:01:27 <dons> right, a lazy list is often a good way of ensuring value aren't computed more than necessary
07:01:29 <xerox> dons: that friend of mine was trying to cabal-install hmp3, but it failed because it needs mkProcessHandle which doesn't exist in GHC 6.4, is there a way to put that in the dependencieS?
07:01:39 <xerox> dons: or fix it?
07:02:05 <dons> you need 6.4.2
07:02:31 <dons> i don't think we can put it in, with current cabal
07:02:31 <xerox> I couldn't find .2 for ppc mac...
07:02:52 <xerox> Well, okay thanks.
07:02:54 <dons> you could check the darcs history and revert the patch that added mkProcessHandle
07:03:24 <LPhas> hi dons :D
07:03:51 <LPhas> sigh how i can survive  5 hour without my fovourite music player? :'(
07:04:01 <dons> :D
07:04:15 <dons> its my favourite too :)
07:04:25 <LPhas> i bet
07:04:40 <dons> let me see what has to be reverted to build under 6.4
07:05:00 <LPhas> naa, bacward compatibility sucks
07:05:06 <LPhas> die, oldie!
07:05:24 <dons> xerox: you can revert this patch;
07:05:25 <dons> Sun Apr 30 18:09:19 EST 2006  Don Stewart <dons@cse.unsw.edu.au>
07:05:26 <dons>   * Port pid2phdl to GHC 6.4.2. HEADS UP: You need 6.4.2 to build hmp3 now.
07:05:29 <xerox> OK.
07:05:34 <LPhas> th
07:05:38 <xerox> A second LPhas
07:06:17 <dons> its a two line change
07:07:09 <xerox> To which file?
07:07:39 <dons> ?paste
07:07:40 <lambdabot> http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell
07:07:44 <xerox> Oh-uhm.
07:08:07 <lisppaste2> dons pasted "Revert this patch" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/24610
07:08:12 <dons> Utils.hs
07:08:23 <xerox> No _darcs dir... I did something wrong
07:08:35 <dons> just invert the patch I paste above
07:08:48 <dons> i.e. add back the lines that are marked with -, and remove lines with +
07:10:41 <xerox> OK, rebuilding the index..
07:11:02 <dons> it compiled?
07:11:30 <xerox> LPhas will tell us :)
07:12:39 <LPhas> xerox, you are uploading the patched code on the repository? or i can try in local...
07:13:35 <xerox> LPhas: update
07:26:42 <spiffy> possibly weird question, is there anything remotely similiar to lisp macros in haskell?
07:27:00 <xerox> Template Haskell might fall in that definition...
07:27:34 <dons> usually you can avoid macros by using higher order functions
07:27:44 <dons> like 95% of the time
07:28:05 <xerox> Wait for the 5% of the time and then try again :P
07:28:25 <dons> heh
07:28:32 <dons> use cpp or TH for the 5%
07:28:53 <spiffy> i think TH is what i want
07:29:19 <dons> yeah, if you need to generate code programmatically at compile time
07:29:40 <LPhas> ok, now it work
07:29:43 <LPhas> s
07:29:47 <xerox> Yay for cabal-install :D
07:29:48 <dons> yay :)
07:29:54 <LPhas> oh, and cabal-install is cool!
07:30:01 <xerox> I paid him for that comment.
07:30:02 <LPhas> i want a repository with... ALL
07:30:04 <dons> heh
07:30:07 <LPhas> of course :P
07:30:28 <LPhas> but it's truly cool
07:30:47 <eivuokko> xerox, Have you tried cabal-install in Windows yet?
07:30:51 <LPhas> damn, i had to install almost all because i reinstalled osx
07:31:05 <LPhas> and with cabal-install it took me half of the time
07:31:11 <xerox> eivuokko: nope
07:31:15 * xerox is happy
07:31:17 <xerox> Hmmmm.
07:31:21 <dons> yeah, that's a good use case
07:31:25 <dons> having to rebuild everything
07:32:18 <eivuokko> xerox, So I should try it very soon if I want possibly Windows issues rooted? :-)
07:32:55 <xerox> eivuokko: Yup. You can try it now. But I didn't commit the multiple-repo patch yet, I am not satisfied :(
07:33:18 <eivuokko> xerox, Main Cabal repo or where can I find it?

07:35:16 <SamB> well, I wouldn't really mind if it didn't feel the need to fill my scrollback with the tale...
07:39:52 <dons> LPhas: do you have any comments or suggestions about hmp3? since you're one of the most heavy users of it

07:42:30 <xerox> ‚â† oh here it is
07:42:43 <SamB> does ‚âÑ mean not approximately equal to?
07:42:44 <roconnor> there should be one with four strokes...
07:43:30 <xerox> I like those: ‚âù, ‚âû, ‚âü, ‚âô, ‚âö, ‚âê, ‚âë, ‚âì, ‚âí, ‚âÉ, , ‚âÖ, ‚âá, ‚âà, ‚âé, ‚âç, ‚âè, ‚â£, ‚â°, ‚â¢.

07:44:01 <xerox> All binary relations!
07:44:09 <SamB> the way they don't show in the same font is kind of tacky
07:44:09 <xerox> Can you tell all the meanings? :)
07:44:13 <xerox> :(
07:44:28 <SamB> I blame Pango!
07:44:37 <SamB> also fonts
07:44:39 <xerox> mathrick|away fix it! (when you are not away)
07:45:02 <roconnor> ‚â£ means ``Damn! these are the same thing''
07:45:23 <SamB> Pango should try to assemble a more aesthetically pleasing collection of characters
07:45:31 <xerox> ``Then why the heck you write it in two different ways!''
07:45:46 <tennin> I'd like "=?" for equality testing
07:45:58 <xerox> The first one is very nice "=def"
07:46:04 <xerox> It would be cool to use that for Haskell definitions!
07:46:07 <tennin> it makes a lot more sense than "==" but is shorter than the Scheme
07:46:09 <roconnor> xerox: you can only use ‚â£ when they are written the same way ;)

08:21:17 <xerox> spiffiness left us.
08:25:31 <tibbe> anyone know how to get URLs to show up in bibtex entries, I assume that some people here have written a paper or two...
08:25:56 <dons> note = \url{}, ?
08:26:07 <dons> @misc{GHC,

08:28:01 <ulfdoz> btw. \\url has some problems with linebreaks, when not using pdflatex.
08:29:39 <tibbe> thanks
08:31:12 <tibbe> dons, hmm, my version of pdflatex doesn't like the \url thingy
08:31:31 <dons> you need to import the url package
08:31:33 <int-e> with \usepackage{url}?
08:32:18 <tibbe> ah, thanks
08:47:15 <svref> What's a less silly way of finding the 4th tail of a list?  Right now the best I can think of is (tail.tail.tail.tail)...:P
08:47:45 <dons> > drop 4 "haskell" -- ?
08:47:51 <lambdabot>  "ell"
08:48:06 <svref> thanks...much less silly!
08:48:09 <dons> :)
08:48:24 <xerox> dcoutts: ping
08:48:27 <ProfTeggy> But amounts to the same computation
08:49:32 <dons> though drop is implemented a bit more efficiently in ghc
08:51:14 <xerox> I need a way to encode a url string to a the name of a directory
08:51:16 <xerox> ....and get back 1:1.
08:51:20 <SamB> > ((!!4) . tails) "hello!"
08:51:21 <lambdabot>  "o!"
08:51:50 <SamB> xerox: z-escaping!
08:51:51 <svref> what is (!!)?
08:51:57 <xerox> ?quote Cale
08:51:58 <SamB> list indexing
08:51:58 <lambdabot>  Beware of the function [a] -> a. For it may contain trappes and sprynges of great variety and harm.
08:52:02 <xerox> ?type (!!)
08:52:03 <lambdabot> forall a. [a] -> Int -> a
08:52:06 <xerox> OK?
08:52:10 <ProfTeggy> tails = iterate tail   ?
08:52:14 * xerox pets lambdabot
08:52:23 <svref> xerox: thanks
08:52:28 <SamB> @free [a] -> a
08:52:28 <lambdabot> Pattern match failure in do expression at Plugin/Free/FreeTheorem.hs:57:20-34

08:52:35 <lambdabot> f . f = f . $map f
08:52:38 <xerox> svref: note the Cale quote :)
08:53:10 <xerox> SamB: Network provides that?
08:53:20 <SamB> xerox: what?
08:53:31 <xerox> The escaping you were talking about
08:53:37 <SamB> xerox: no!
08:53:42 <SamB> I was mostly kidding
08:53:54 <SamB> that is what GHC uses to escape symbols
08:54:54 <xerox> >>> urllib.unquote(urllib.quote('http://d.a.o/~paolo/packg/',safe=''))
08:54:54 <xerox> 'http://d.a.o/~paolo/packg/'
08:55:02 <xerox> In python seem to work this way..
08:55:13 <xerox> Let's see.
08:56:54 <xerox> Prelude Network.URI> escapeURIString isUnreserved "http://d.h.o/~paolo/darcs/packages"
08:56:54 <xerox> "http%3A%2F%2Fd.h.o%2F~paolo%2Fdarcs%2Fpackages"
08:57:00 <xerox> Is it good enough for a directory name? :(
08:58:04 <xerox> I am not sure.
08:58:20 <xerox> Do you know if I have to do this madness to avoid a behavior like mkdir -p "foo/bar/baz" ?
09:00:21 <Igloo> Is this for cabal?
09:00:41 <Igloo> If so, you know what characters are allowed to be used, don't you?
09:00:53 <xerox> Yes it is.
09:01:16 <Igloo> So just give an error if you find bad characters
09:01:16 <xerox> What do you mean?
09:01:17 <xerox> My concern is wrt filesystems.
09:01:31 * Igloo might have misunderstood exactly what you're trying to do
09:01:41 <xerox> URLs are supposed to be full of bad characters I believe.
09:01:47 <xerox> I need to handle multiple repositories.
09:01:59 <Igloo> Ah, I get ya
09:02:13 <Igloo> And you need to support Windows, MacOS etc too for this, right?
09:02:14 <xerox> I can't put all the packages in one local packages/ repository because packages could clash.
09:02:28 <xerox> I very much think so.
09:02:55 <ProfTeggy> The above makes for a valid filename on Mac OS X at least
09:03:06 <Igloo> I'd pick a set of obviously-safe characters and %escape or zencode or whatever you like anything else
09:03:20 <dons> Igloo: oh, I almost forgot, this still breaks the base build on openbsd (and other old fashioned systems, I presume): http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-all/2006-May/047470.html
09:03:21 <lambdabot> Title: Build failure and UINTMAX_T
09:03:34 <xerox> Igloo: may you elaborate on that?
09:03:55 <dons> i'd forgotten, since I always don't pull the original patch http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-all/2006-May/047438.html
09:03:56 <lambdabot> Title: patch applied (packages/base): add CIntPtr, CUIntPtr, CIntMax, CUIntMax types
09:04:11 <mnislaih> eivuokko: ping
09:04:18 <Igloo> xerox: concatMap (\x -> if x `elem` "abc..." then [x] else '%':showAsHex (ord x))   (roughly speaking)
09:04:28 <eivuokko> mnislaih, Hiya
09:04:38 <Igloo> (but written more efficiently)
09:04:46 <xerox> Igloo: right. I wonder if Network.URI provides that
09:04:56 <xerox> I can't find the right predicate it seems.
09:05:03 <xerox> ?docs Network.URI
09:05:04 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/network/Network-URI.html
09:05:13 <mnislaih> hi Esa, I finally got around to using the testsuite patches. I'm having some problems in Mac Os. Which is the required Python version ?
09:05:20 <eivuokko> 2.4
09:05:23 <eivuokko> I think
09:05:33 <Igloo> dons: Noted, ta. I'll try to take a look tomorrow.
09:05:36 <eivuokko> What does it say?  About threading.local?
09:06:11 <ptolomy> what is the most portable and easy way to do bitmap animations in haskell?
09:06:13 <dons> Igloo: I think John Meacham had a hint about some autoconf script that generates valid defaults for such systems. that might be something to look at
09:06:15 <mnislaih> it says 2.4 here. It's the Python that comes preinstalled in Mac Os, maybe it's an underpowered version
09:06:33 <mnislaih> lots of errors. I'll do a paste
09:06:41 <dons> ptolomy: gtk2hs maybe?
09:06:43 <mnislaih> @paste
09:06:44 <lambdabot> http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell
09:07:05 * ptolomy likes to hope that the ghc standard install (or the hugs one) have something somewhere akin to the ocaml Graphics module..
09:07:36 <lisppaste2> mnislaih pasted "testsuite driver errors" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/24623
09:07:39 <dons> HOpenGL maybe?
09:07:41 <ths> Hm, my registerised GHC for mips is much faster when compiling its libraries.
09:07:48 <dons> ths, cool!
09:07:52 <dons> mips64?
09:07:54 * xerox trembles
09:08:02 <xerox> ".."!
09:08:26 <ths> dons: No, Debian mips (o32).
09:08:31 <dons> ah right
09:08:46 <dons> I build on irix/mips64 every now and then
09:09:12 <eivuokko> mnislaih, I don't get it...
09:09:22 <xerox> Igloo: what about a hash?
09:09:23 <dons> unregisterised though. actually, I think I have some mips manuals somewhere
09:09:32 <eivuokko> mnislaih, Could you get testlib.py cleanly from repo?
09:09:48 <mnislaih> sure
09:09:54 <ths> dons: I chose the registers in a way which might just work on NewABI as well.
09:10:14 <dons> ths, would these be useful to you:
09:10:15 <dons> MIPS64_Vol1_Introduction_to_the_MIPS64_Architecture_v0.95.pdf
09:10:15 <dons> MIPS64_Vol2_The_MIPS64_Instruction_Set_v0.95.pdf
09:10:15 <dons> MIPS64_Vol3_The_MIPS64_Privileged_Resource_Architecture_v0.95.pdf
09:10:25 <eivuokko> mnislaih, The error simply doesn't match my testlib.py
09:10:29 <lispy> xb
09:10:31 <lispy> er...sorry
09:10:33 <Igloo> xerox: I've often found it useful that the filenames apt uses are human readable
09:10:48 <ths> dons: *grin*
09:10:49 <dons> (maybe they're availabel somewhere else, not sure. I remember they were mailed to me by someone wanting mips/ghc to work )
09:11:15 <xerox> Igloo: that's right too, I could put a URL file inside...
09:11:23 <dons> ths, actually, does debian run mips64?
09:11:24 <xerox> Igloo: on the other hand quoted urls aren't exacly *readable*
09:11:24 <ths> dons: You get them for free registation from the MIPS Technologies website. :-)
09:11:28 <dons> ah right
09:11:38 <dons> I didn't get them that way :)
09:11:44 <dons> so I thought they must have been hard to get hold of
09:11:54 <Igloo> xerox: apt ends up with files like ftp.uk.debian.org_debian-amd64_debian_dists_stable_contrib_binary-amd64_Packages
09:11:59 <ths> dons: Debian has now some 64bit kernels, but still no 64bit userland.
09:12:02 <xerox> Igloo: this is interesting
09:12:11 <xerox> Igloo: what if there are _ in the url, though?
09:12:22 <dons> ths, oh that's a pity. 64 bits mips is fun.
09:12:23 <Igloo> Oh, I should have suggested handling _ specially up above
09:12:23 <lispy> ths: not true
09:12:37 <Igloo> I don't know what apt does, but you could %encode (or whatever you do) real '_'s
09:12:40 <ths> dons: Distributing them is a problem, our lawyers are crazy.
09:12:43 <ths> lispy: ?
09:12:48 <lispy> ths: i run a machine with a pure  64bit userland, at least if i understand you correctly i do
09:12:49 <xerox> Igloo: that is true
09:12:49 <dons> edison$ ./a.out
09:12:50 <dons> mipseb
09:12:50 <dons> irix
09:12:51 <dons> :)
09:12:57 <xerox> Igloo: I am also concerned about '.'
09:12:58 <ths> lispy: Then it isn't Debian.
09:13:03 <lispy> ths: and it's debian
09:13:07 <xerox> Igloo: '../../../../foo' might be a problem
09:13:10 <dons> ths, ah fair enough
09:13:11 <ths> lispy: Then it isn't MIPS.
09:13:23 <lispy> ths: ah, okay no it's not mips
09:13:59 <xerox> No it is not a problem.
09:14:05 <xerox> Igloo: ok! I'll do that way!
09:14:24 <dons> ths, hmm. so maybe now ghc might run registerised on irix/mips32 abi?
09:14:36 <dons> i never tried that, since 64 bits just worked
09:14:40 <mnislaih> eivuokko: the clean one works fine. I diffed them and turns out I had made a tiny modification to testlib.py a few days ago and forgot about that
09:14:55 <LPhas> i tried to build ghc snapshot distribution from the stable branc
09:14:56 <xerox> Prelude Network.URI> escapeURIString (/='/') "http://darcs.haskell.org/~paolo/packages"

09:15:21 <ths> dons: With my changes it has a chance to work for n32, and with another small change even on n64.
09:15:24 <mnislaih> eivuokko:  sorry o¬øo !
09:15:35 <dons> ths, ah! let me know if you want me to try out any patches
09:15:36 <eivuokko> mnislaih, np :-)  Good thing it gets tested a bit
09:15:48 <mnislaih> now, how do I get this to smoke my Core Duo? -j4 will do ?
09:15:56 <dons> edison$ uname -msr
09:15:57 <ths> dons: That is, if it really works. I probably should run the testsuite before declaring victory. :-)
09:15:57 <dons> IRIX64 6.5 IP30
09:15:57 <eivuokko> mnislaih, THREADS=4
09:16:10 <ths> dons: An, an Octane.
09:16:13 <lispy> Brian Hulley should just define a new language...he seems to be redefining haskell syntax just for his editor :)
09:16:27 <dons> ths, yes! if you check the logs, my working unregisterised 64 bit ghc still failed a bunch of weird things in the testsuite
09:16:28 <eivuokko> mnislaih, I usually use THREADS=3 on hyperthreaded P4, which is pretty good
09:16:32 <dons> but it was about 90% there
09:16:44 <dons> hopefully though its a bit easier under linux
09:16:51 <dons> since you don't have so many lib issues to deal with
09:17:02 <xerox> LPhas: your machine name is silly :P
09:17:16 <LPhas> xerox: what an useful comment!
09:17:16 <Igloo> lispy: Was that while building ALUT?
09:17:25 <lispy> would be interesting if darcs had 'split' and 'join' for working on slices of repositories
09:17:31 <ths> dons: Is yours a SMP machine?
09:17:43 <lispy> Igloo: was what while building ALUT?
09:17:47 <mnislaih> THREADS=10 makes some tests give fake failures, is that right ?
09:17:53 <Igloo> LPhas: Was that while building ALUT?
09:18:00 <Igloo> lispy: Sorry  :-)
09:18:04 <eivuokko> Is there an easy way to trigger ghc bug #652 - compiled code and dynamically linked code don't share Typeable-table?
09:18:05 <lispy> Igloo: n/p
09:18:18 <dons> yeah, a quad octane (its a colleague's box)
09:18:21 <ths> dons: And if it is, does GHC use threads on it?
09:18:23 <LPhas> Igloo: who knows?
09:18:34 <ths> dons: Quad?
09:18:34 <eivuokko> mnislaih, It shouldn't.  If it does, those tests should be serialised.
09:18:53 <ths> dons: I haven't seen more than Dual.
09:18:56 <Igloo> LPhas: Can you put the log (or the last 100 lines of it) on the web/a paste page?
09:18:58 <dons> it could be a dual then.
09:19:01 <LPhas> xerox: the plugins package of your repo is bugged
09:19:11 <LPhas> Igoo: of course, wait a min
09:19:12 <lispy> Igloo: although, i haven't been able to build ghc on osx because of a problem finding the OpenAL package which seems to be related to ALUT
09:19:21 <LPhas> xerox: Setup.lhs: Error: file is not executable: "./configure"
09:19:21 <LPhas> cabal-install: Command failed: 'configure Setup.lhs configure'. Errno: 1
09:19:24 <dons> its been a while since i've played with it, but I don't think i've tested it since we got the threaded rts as default
09:19:26 <ths> dons: I think it doesn't have enough space for four CPUs.
09:19:31 <eivuokko> mnislaih, I'll have to wait until next nights builds to see if they got extra errors.
09:19:37 <xerox> LPhas: do you need it right now?
09:19:41 <mnislaih> eivuokko they're not mine, I'm testing the vanilla ghci tests. Maybe they have dependencies between tests if they haven't been written with parallelism in mind
09:19:45 <Igloo> lispy: If it's ALUT that's failing then just tell GHC not to build either of them
09:19:52 <dons> ths, yeah, you're probably right.
09:20:16 <LPhas> xerox: no, but if you have a repository, i beat you want it working
09:20:22 <eivuokko> mnislaih, Hmmm.   Could you have other changes, in driver/runtests.py that somehow affect this?
09:20:36 <mnislaih> I will check
09:20:46 <xerox> LPhas: fixed
09:20:49 <lispy> Igloo: well, OpenAL builds without any problems and ALUT fails because OpenAL is missing...so it seems like i should be able to build ALUT, doesn't it?
09:21:00 <eivuokko> mnislaih, I have ran ghci tests a bit myself, because there is/was a rts/Linker problem in Windows.
09:21:18 <Igloo> lispy: That sounds odd
09:21:33 <LPhas> xerox: thx
09:21:33 <Igloo> lispy: The C or Haskell OpenAL is missing?
09:21:45 <xerox> LPhas: tell me whatever you find! Thanks much!
09:21:50 <lispy> Igloo: http://paste.lisp.org/display/24624
09:21:59 <lispy> Igloo: oh, mm...maybe the C is missing
09:22:43 <Igloo> lispy: OpenAL didn't build, it did nothing (configure disabled it because the C dev libraries were missing)
09:22:48 <mnislaih> eivuokko: looks like I don't. I can repeat the tests from a clean repo later if that helps
09:23:23 <eivuokko> mnislaih, Could you paste the tests that fail, I'll check?
09:23:33 <LPhas> http://paste.lisp.org/display/24625
09:23:37 <lispy> Igloo: oh, ...how could you tell?
09:23:38 <eivuokko> Or are they are failing?
09:23:44 <LPhas> here u are
09:23:54 <Igloo> lispy: Try it with --disable-openal --disable-alut
09:24:02 <lispy> Igloo: the results you see are from running make twice in a row, so maybe it just skipped it this time?
09:24:04 <lispy> okay
09:24:10 <lispy> in configure?
09:24:11 <Igloo> lispy: It would have done ghc -M if it was planning to build it
09:24:19 <lispy> okay
09:24:21 <lispy> thanks
09:24:26 <Igloo> To configure, yes
09:24:53 <eivuokko> mnislaih, prog 1-3 fail for me on ghci dir....but they are serialised already becauyse they are on their own dirs.
09:24:55 <mnislaih> with THREADS=10: ghci0 [01,05, 08, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. From those, 08, 11 and 15 fail on themselves. The others are unexpected fails
09:25:08 <Igloo> LPhas: Right, same as lispy. I think configure --disable-openal --disable-alut should do it
09:25:15 <eivuokko> mnislaih, Sounds bad :-(
09:26:32 <mnislaih> It's not that of a big problem. I can have a choice to run my testsuite fast and approximate or slow but safe
09:26:46 <LPhas> thx
09:26:55 <eivuokko> mnislaih, If you run them with THREADS=1, does it happen too?
09:26:58 <mnislaih> and anyway, I don't have 10 cores, only 2, and with THREADS=4 there are no spurious failures
09:26:58 <LPhas> and anyone knows nothing about gtk2hs on macosx?
09:27:07 <eivuokko> mnislaih, I don't see how they could be failing because of threading
09:27:28 <mnislaih> nope.
09:27:32 <eivuokko> Uhhuh
09:28:12 <eivuokko> mnislaih, How do they fail?
09:28:31 <mnislaih> let's check ghci001
09:28:34 <mnislaih> seems a simple one
09:28:36 <eivuokko> Right, it's very simple
09:29:20 <mnislaih> looks like timeout
09:29:27 <eivuokko> Huh!
09:29:58 <eivuokko> Default timeout is 5mins?
09:30:56 <mnislaih> the others seem to fail in the same way- timeout: thread blocked indefinitely
09:31:25 <eivuokko> How about THREADS=2 ?
09:31:41 <mnislaih> I wouldn't be too worried about this eivuokko: THREADS=n where n is a reasonable number works perfectly
09:31:58 <mnislaih> i.e. 2,3,4, those I have tried and work fine
09:32:00 <eivuokko> I am fairly sure it is threaded rts bug
09:32:09 <eivuokko> And overloaded processor
09:32:25 <mnislaih> I don't know if I build my rts with -threaded. Is that the default ?
09:32:31 <eivuokko> Yes, for stage2
09:32:49 <eivuokko> Eh, I mean, it is for stage2 ghci
09:33:15 <mnislaih> o.o
09:33:29 <eivuokko> Has been for a while now.  It's pretty cool when playing with threads.
09:34:18 <eivuokko> Before threads stopped when ghci was waiting at the prompt.  Kinda annoying for GUI hacking for example.

09:46:24 <LPhas> new errors trying to compile ghc...
09:53:44 <mnislaih> the -D flag in ghc is used for the C preprocessor right ?
09:54:19 <mnislaih> what difference does it make to launch ghci with -Di386_apple_darwin ?
09:54:53 <mnislaih> sorry, I mean effect to ghci itself.  I am not loading or compiling any code
09:55:53 <mnislaih> the testsuite  follows this convention, and I can't imagine the purpose, but it seems to have a weird interaction with ghci
09:56:29 <mnislaih> the order of the payload elements of a closure seems to be reversed, and my closure viewer fails

11:15:16 <araujo> hello
11:15:58 <ookk> when i want to do something to many values for instance 1-10000000 i would use a for-loop in an imperative language, but in haskell i have to create a list with 10000000 elements which results in a stack overflow or use ugly stuff like seq, isnt there any better way to do it?
11:16:50 <swiert> ookk: write a (tail-recursive) function?
11:17:44 <ookk> even if i do there is always expressions in it that isnt evaluated directly f n = 1 + f (n-1) for instance
11:18:14 <ookk> if you use sufficiently large n it will overflow beacause it does not evalutate 1+ untill the last moment
11:18:35 <ookk> is there a better way to force strict evalutation?
11:20:30 <PaulAJ> ookk: Do you know about foldl'?
11:21:00 <ookk> yes i do
11:21:19 <ookk> but i think you loose the point of the nice syntax in haskell when you have to resort to fold' and seq
11:21:32 <PaulAJ> Well, I guess that having to give the compiler hints occasionally is the price you pay.  I kind of agree with you about seq: its
11:21:41 <ookk> in Clean you can state if an expression should be strict or not
11:22:07 <PaulAJ> a low level thing.  But !$, strict data type members and so on go a long way to getting rid of the problem.
11:22:58 <jeffno> I'm trying to follow: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Class_Declarations
11:22:58 <ookk> it would be easier to write faster code
11:23:11 <ookk> that is not obfuscated by seq and foldl'
11:23:19 <jeffno> Any idea why "data Foo = Foo (x :: Integer, str :: String)" won't compile inside of ghci?
11:24:20 <int-e> because you need curly brackets there
11:24:45 <jeffno> Ah, thanks
11:25:13 <int-e> it's icky but I guess parsing would be more difficult otherwise.
11:26:03 <jeffno> I don't mind the curly brackets.  Just trying to learn stuff when tutorial code doesn't compile is frustrating :)
11:26:40 * PaulAJ goes to fix the wikibook
11:29:57 <PaulAJ> Tis fixed.
11:30:08 <PaulAJ> Rather embarassing actually: I wrote that bit.
11:34:19 <swiert> ookk: ghc should be able to handle pretty big calls to tail recursive functions. Are you running an interpreter?
11:41:50 <PaulAJ> > let f n = 1 + f (n-1) in f 1000
11:41:52 <lambdabot>  Exception: stack overflow
11:42:17 <PaulAJ> Of course, thats not tail recursive.
11:42:22 <int-e> jeffno: the part that's icky is that {} are associated with layout in other places, but not in this one. it's just a minor aesthetic issue.
11:45:35 <PaulAJ> After f(n-1) returns it has to add 1 to it.  Also, you have got the f(0) case?  I just realised I forgot it.
11:46:01 <PaulAJ> > let f 0 = 0; f n = 1 + f (n-1) in f 1000

11:47:27 <int-e> oh. that'll cause stack overflows if not used carefully.

11:49:01 <saccade_> what channel should I go to to ask questions about the equivalence of DFAs and regular expressions?
11:49:23 <ihope_> saccade_: #math, I'm guessing
11:49:36 <ihope_> Or... #perl, was it? :-)
11:54:15 <sieni> saccade_: that of course needs some qualifiers. I think that e.g. perl regular expressions describe a larger class than just dfa:s
11:54:44 <sieni> I have a book called "mastering regular expressions" that explained that a bit, but not too deeply
11:55:15 <sieni> probably a better channel would be #theoretical_computer_science or whatever that would be called here
11:55:50 <SamB> what is the difference between #theoretical_computer_science and #haskell?
11:56:08 <int-e> hmm, haskell is applied tcs?
11:56:20 * int-e giggles
11:59:58 <mathrick> <SamB> the way they don't show in the same font is kind of tacky <-- this is your font's fault
12:00:17 <mathrick> or fontconfig configuration, in which case it could be probably fixed
12:00:49 <mathrick> SamB: but unless you have one font to contain all of them, it's fonts' fault
12:05:18 <tibbe> partition is defined in terms of filter like so: partition p xs == (filter p xs, filter (not . p) xs)
12:05:42 <tibbe> but if I would declare a partitionM in the same manner wouldn't I get duplicated side effects in the IO monad?

12:17:47 <lambda_the_insig> hello, I'm hoping to use an STRef from within a runSTUArray call, however I can't seem to get the typechecker to agree with the code that I'm writing.  Is there some example of using an STRef from within the STUArray's construction?  (In this case, I'm using the STRef to store an infinite list of possibilities to try while constructing the STUArray, which when I find one that works, I write the tail of the list back to the
12:17:52 <lambda_the_insig>  STRef.)
12:18:07 <lambda_the_insig> Alternate suggestions are appreciated as well.
12:18:10 <lambda_the_insig> :-)
12:18:31 <SamB> @paste

12:18:50 <SamB> because I think it ought to work
12:19:30 <lisppaste2> lambda_the_insignificant pasted "STRef/runSTUArray" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/24634
12:19:51 <lambda_the_insig> there is a fair amount of other cruft; the function in question the "placeWords"
12:20:03 <lambda_the_insig> (the only place that the runSTUArray appears, FWIW)
12:21:55 <ski> hm, why do you use 'runST' inside 'runSTUArray' ?
12:22:23 <ski> @type Control.Monad.ST.runST
12:22:24 <lambdabot> forall a. (forall s. GHC.ST.ST s a) -> a
12:22:27 <ski> @type Data.Array.ST.runSTUArray
12:22:28 <lambdabot> forall e i. (Ix i) => (forall s. GHC.ST.ST s (Data.Array.Base.STUArray s i e)) -> Data.Array.Base.UArray i e
12:22:39 <lambda_the_insig> throwing spaghetti against teh wall to see what sticks... :)
12:22:44 <sjanssen> lambda_the_insig: what ski pointed out is your first problem
12:22:53 <lambda_the_insig> I hadn't had that initially.
12:24:01 <sjanssen> @hoogle mapArray
12:24:01 <lambdabot> Data.Array.MArray.mapArray :: (MArray a e' m, MArray a e m, Ix i) => (e' -> e) -> a i e' -> m (a i e)
12:24:38 <sjanssen> lambda_the_insig: also, note that mapArray makes a copy of the array, you might not want to do that
12:26:18 <ski> (minor point, it looks a little strange to have '... = let ... in ... where ...' .. why not put all inside the 'where' ?)
12:26:20 <tibbe> ?hoogle concatM
12:26:21 <lambdabot> Prelude.concatMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
12:26:59 <lambda_the_insig> ok, makes sense.
12:27:38 <lisppaste2> sjanssen annotated #24634 with "this typechecks" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/24634#1
12:28:16 <sjanssen> lambda_the_insig: your problem was the foldM_, that isn't actually what you wanted
12:28:53 <lambda_the_insig> ok.
12:29:00 <lambda_the_insig> what was what I wanted? :-)
12:29:07 <sjanssen> mapM_
12:29:25 <sjanssen> (I think, at least it gets past the typechecker that way)
12:29:36 <lambda_the_insig> well, I was hoping to modify the array iteratively across the list of elems.
12:29:55 <lambda_the_insig> i.e., start with an empty array, and then place words one at a time.
12:30:02 <sjanssen> you don't need a fold if you're modifying the array inside a Monad
12:30:09 <lambda_the_insig> iteratively over the same data; seemed like a fold to me... :)
12:30:10 <tibbe> how nice, I managed to get infinite recursion somehow :/
12:30:58 <lambda_the_insig> ok, thanks for the assistance.
12:32:16 <sjanssen> lambda_the_insig: a Monadic map is sort of like a fold.  The state that hides in the monad is like the accumulating parameter in foldl
12:32:57 <lambda_the_insig> I see.
12:37:14 <sjanssen> @type \f s xs -> snd $ runState (mapM_ (\x -> get >>= put . flip f x) xs) s -- here is foldl in terms of State and mapM_
12:37:15 <lambdabot> forall a c. (c -> a -> c) -> c -> [a] -> c
12:43:31 <lambda_the_insig> thanks, sjanssen, ski.  That supplies the functionality I was looking for.

13:24:48 <lambdabot> problems and as a reward the Tangled Gnomes gave them the S
13:25:16 <SamB> aww... cut off!
13:25:26 <heatsink> the S combinator?

13:30:09 <jbalint> Hi.
13:30:51 <sjanssen> hello jbalint
13:31:14 <jbalint> I am trying to figure out how to do this http://rafb.net/paste/results/7Mu9qp86.html The function ldpf seems to be the only indendent one, the other ones seem mutually dependant on each other.
13:33:22 <heatsink> What do you mean about independent functions?
13:33:49 <jbalint> how can i create them if they need each other before they can be created?
13:34:23 <heatsink> They're all read before they are created.
13:34:33 <heatsink> >let {x = y + 1; y = 2} in x
13:34:37 <heatsink> > let {x = y + 1; y = 2} in x
13:34:38 <lambdabot>  3
13:34:45 <heatsink> > let {y = 2; x = y + 1} in x
13:34:46 <lambdabot>  3
13:34:48 <jbalint> Oh, let me put them in a file.
13:34:50 <tibbe> hmpf, I want to know what OS my program is running on so I can fetch the correct path separator char
13:35:22 <heatsink> I think that's in the System.Info module.  I don't know if there's a platform-independent way to do it.
13:35:54 <jbalint> Ok, I should have tried that earlier. :) Thanks.
13:35:59 <heatsink> sho
13:37:40 <xerox> > let odds = 1 : map (+1) evens; evens = map (+1) odds in zip odds evens

13:37:50 <chessguy> anyone familiar with SICP, the video series?
13:38:03 <SamB> tibbe: why not just use a /?
13:38:09 <psi> I've seen a few of them.
13:38:20 <xerox> Yep!
13:38:30 <heatsink> SamB: on windows it is \
13:38:37 <SamB> heatsink: / usually works too though
13:38:59 <chessguy> they do a lot of stuff like (define (+rat r1 r2)...), but what prevents someone from then doing (+rat PI (2*PI))
13:39:14 <chessguy> is there a purely functional way of preventing this?
13:39:17 <xerox> (+rat PI (* 2 PI))
13:39:31 <chessguy> yes, sorry, typo
13:39:37 <SamB> WTH is +rat
13:39:44 <xerox> The fact that one has to use make-rat ?
13:39:45 <sjanssen> chessguy: so you want to restrict the arguments to rationals?
13:39:46 <chessguy> it adds two rational numbers together
13:39:53 <chessguy> yes
13:39:56 <xerox> Nothing in fact
13:39:57 <SamB> oh
13:40:10 <SamB> the fact that PI isn't a rational number might do the trick...
13:40:13 <sjanssen> chessguy: there is a way: use a sexily typed language like Haskell
13:40:14 <xerox> You'd get a runtime error in many cases
13:40:27 <SamB> > pi + 2*pi :: Rational
13:40:28 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Floating Rational)
13:40:29 <xerox> s/sexily/statically checked/
13:40:58 <SamB> heh
13:41:00 <xerox> You should ask that question in #scheme
13:41:21 <chessguy> i asked in lisp and was told that i should use lisp classes
13:41:33 <xerox> Right, but that is Scheme, not Common Lisp.
13:41:46 <SamB> did you ask them why + is not a method?
13:41:51 <SamB> ... you should!
13:41:53 <chessguy> mmm
13:42:06 <chessguy> it's not?
13:42:21 * chessguy assumes that by method you mean procedure
13:42:37 <SamB> * #'+
13:42:37 <SamB> #<Function + {10127429}>
13:42:40 <xerox> Nope, he means method in the object-oriented programming sense
13:43:10 <xerox> Which in case of CL means something specific, given the CLOS.
13:43:12 <tibbe> SamB, Does it work alright on Windows?
13:43:38 <SamB> tibbe: if you aren't passing the path to ignorant programs on the commandline, sure!
13:45:43 <hitodama> what does the term "principal type" mean in Haskell?
13:46:14 <xerox> It is the most general type of an expression
13:46:14 <SamB> a principle type is a most general type that can be inferred for something
13:46:46 <xerox> Take id, it can be given the type Int -> Int, (a -> b) -> a -> b, etc.. but the most general one is a -> a.
13:46:47 <SamB> at least, I assume they can always be inferred if they exist...
13:46:57 <hitodama> hmm, so it's used for polymorphic objects?
13:47:09 <xerox> s/objects/types/
13:47:52 <xerox> I don't think so, anyway
13:48:19 <xerox> ?type chr . (+13) . ord
13:48:21 <lambdabot> Char -> Char
13:48:28 <xerox> That is its most general type.
13:48:36 <hitodama> ahh
13:48:39 <hitodama> I think I see, thanks
13:48:58 <nilsi> i wonder if theoretical computer science is applied haskell
13:48:59 <xerox> But I believe it makes sense to ask for it only if you have polymorphic types :)
13:49:13 <xerox> nilsi: that's part of the principal idea! :)
13:49:22 <xerox> nilsi: did you see the paper `History of Haskell' ?
13:49:43 <nilsi> yes, version 1 that is
13:51:20 <nilsi> i like the short examples of advanced type theory i never use

13:57:39 <sjanssen> w/o balancing would be pretty easy
13:58:38 <heatsink> If you can write a finite map in the type system, you would have associated types, right?
13:58:45 <beelsebob> @seen shapr
13:58:45 <lambdabot> I saw shapr leaving #haskell and #ScannedInAvian 6 days, 2 hours, 15 minutes and 12 seconds ago, and .
13:58:48 <hitodama> hm why does func xs = map ((/2).(+1)) xs work, but not func = map ((/2).(+1)) ?

13:59:09 <heatsink> hahaha!
13:59:20 <xerox> hitodama: it should

14:06:26 <xerox> boom
14:07:08 * heatsink is dizzy
14:09:44 <heatsink> You see, from your perspective, the other person leaves the room and comes back but you don't move.  From the other person's perspective, you leave the room and come back but they don't move.  That's relativity!  IIRC.
14:11:09 <SamB> that only works if it is a real netsplit
14:12:16 <heatsink> What other kind of netsplit happens?
14:12:48 <heatsink> I thought all these multiple-quit multiple-enter events were netsplits.
14:13:51 <SamB> well, sometimes they skip the multiple-enter bit
14:13:57 <SamB> which means it is a fake netsplit
14:14:11 <SamB> when a downed server has been cut loose from the network...
14:16:55 <heatsink> That would be a miscolored horse.
14:19:25 <tibbe> I'm thinking of writing some sort if dry run function. It would gather a bunch of IO actions [IO ()] and then either execute them or pretty print the function names, would that even be possible or do I need to create my own data type for it?
14:20:16 <swiert> tibbe: yes. There's no easy way to figure out a function's name.
14:20:21 <tibbe> basically it would be a list of removeDirs and removeFiles
14:21:27 <tibbe> swiert, ok, I'll go with a data IOAction = RemoveDir FilePath | RemoveFile FilePath then, although it feels a bit like repition
14:22:53 <svref> So are guards in case expressions exactly equivalent to if-then-else-if... statements in the body?
14:24:08 <ndm> so Cabal then, where do i email a Cabal question to?
14:24:08 <lambdabot> ndm: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
14:24:23 <musasabi> cabal-dev perhaps
14:24:35 <musasabi> or haskell-cafe depending on the question
14:24:41 <ndm> musasabi: or libraries@ (thats what teh docs say), or haskell-care
14:24:51 <ndm> yeah, i don't care where, but i would like to have one answer
14:24:55 <heatsink> svref, yea
14:25:08 <ndm> anyway, the question is: what about extra files to distribute with an app
14:25:08 <xerox> tibbe: you could roll up your own monad
14:25:23 <ndm> for example cpphs includes a settings file, and a .css file, which need to be distributed to
14:25:36 <ndm> I saw how Alex does it, but it uses hooks and copies things itself, which is yuk
14:25:38 <xerox> tibbe: WriterT IO [String] a, and then have your actions doing lift (tell "name") :)
14:25:39 <musasabi> there is a extra-files section I think
14:26:01 <ndm> musasabi: yes, extra-source-files, but its not copied into the installation
14:26:25 <ndm> extra-source-files-which-need-installing is that i want, but can't see anything like that

14:26:53 <tibbe> xerox, does it (WriterT) perform the actions and write a log?
14:27:32 <ndm> @tell dons if you can convince me there has ever been a time when a user has wanted to search for a kind i might add it :) - in reality though there are too many types for each kind, and haddock doesn't know kinds, so its hard to get the info
14:27:32 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
14:27:57 <tibbe> xerox, or do you mean that the actions should be parameterized with a boolean flag that decides if it will be executed or "told"?
14:27:58 <ndm> @tell dons but i did add some kind support to hoogle today, as it happens, so it can spot when you search for Maybe, when you meant Maybe a

15:29:24 <lambdabot>  Kind error
15:29:26 <xerox> Preprocessors?
15:29:32 <ndm> for example, hoogle depends on trhsx, as a preprocessor not as a package
15:29:42 <ndm> say a program requires cpphs, which isn't installed
15:29:59 <xerox> There is no way to say that to Cabal yet, I believe.
15:30:02 <ndm> could cabal-get grab cpphs (a haskell/cabal program), but which isn't a library dependancy, but a preprocessor one
15:30:26 <ndm> thats a shame, since haddock depends on happy and alex, alex depends on happy
15:30:33 <ndm> its quite a mess to get those 3 in the right order
15:30:40 <ndm> (esp when at least one is broken in HEAD at the mo)
15:30:52 <xerox> ndm: do you remember when I told you what Alex Jacobson was telling me....
15:31:05 <ndm> xerox: remind me :)
15:31:05 <SamB> I think you are supposed to grab them from your distribution's package manager
15:31:15 <xerox> ndm: that problem isn't solvable in general :(
15:31:27 <ndm> xerox: why not - simply list the required preprocessors?
15:32:22 <xerox> ndm: circularities like the one you mentioned are a problem, aren't them?
15:32:36 <ndm> xerox: it isn't circular, there is exactly one linear path to do it
15:32:45 <ndm> which is why having a program that solved it would be nicer
15:32:51 <ndm> and i think it could get quite far
15:33:00 <ndm> at the moment the hoogle install instructions are going to have to be
15:33:01 <xerox> Oh right, happy first.
15:33:15 <ndm> cabal get trhsx, build, install, then do hoogle
15:33:24 <ndm> i.e. "here are a list of dependancies, please build them"
15:33:40 <xerox> That sounds okay, as long as it is haskell software.
15:33:51 <ndm> yeah, i realise that preprocessors that aren't haskell won't work
15:34:07 * SamB will write a preprocessor in C, called "wrench"
15:34:08 <ndm> but i can't think of any haskell preprocessors not written in haskell
15:34:35 <ndm> SamB: and someone can port it to haskell, in 5% of the time it takes you to track down the memory leaks :)
15:34:47 <xerox> Anyway, now we have build-deps, it is surely possible to add other kind-of-deps.
15:35:02 <SamB> okay, maybe I'll write it in Python instead
15:35:09 <xerox> Just matter of: a. decide a design with the cabal-devel hackers and b. implement it.
15:35:12 <int-e> perl?
15:35:23 <SamB> or perl ;-)
15:35:31 <xerox> Then let it be a oneliner!
15:35:34 <int-e> I know, Java. Java has garbage collection, so memory leaks aren't a problem. Right?
15:35:39 <SamB> xerox: thats no good
15:35:52 <SamB> then it will just be included in the cabal file or something
15:36:01 <xerox> SamB: you could do a system("") from a C source and don't tell anyone.
15:36:05 <ndm> happy and alex both have one line perl preprocessors in their Setup.hs
15:36:38 <SamB> ndm: yes but those can't be called "wrench" or mess up the niceness of Cabal
15:36:45 * xerox is reminded of the GHC evil mangler
15:37:10 <ndm> xerox: one day, that will be killed - it seems like SimonMar's life ambition
15:37:13 <int-e> but that's a postprocessor not a preprocessor, that's totally different.
15:37:31 <xerox> ndm: yarrr
15:37:37 <xerox> int-e: off course.
15:37:55 <int-e> Oh and I was hoping I was just barely on course.
15:37:56 <ths> int-e: It looked like a postpervertor to me. :-)
15:38:50 <SamB> "pervert" and "process" are remarkably similar in meaning
15:39:01 <int-e> it does some interesting optimizations
15:39:29 <ndm> but Cmm will obsolete it, we all hope
15:39:38 <int-e> for example it turns some indirect jumps into direct jumps :)
15:40:04 <xerox> `indirect' in what sense?
15:40:18 <ths> Via register, I guess.
15:40:29 <int-e> via memory or registers
15:40:36 <int-e> (on x86 both is possible)
15:40:37 <xerox> Ah, I see.
15:41:15 <tibbe> @pl concat $ zipWith (\prefix dirs -> map ((prefix ++ "/") ++) dirs )
15:41:15 <lambdabot> join (zipWith (map . (++) . (++ "/")))
15:41:24 <tibbe> ugh
15:42:03 <tibbe> dunno if that got more readable
15:42:28 <tibbe> ndm, is Cmm still worked on?
15:42:35 <ndm> tibbe: its the future (TM)
15:42:51 <ndm> i saw a pile of patches recently, quite a lot of work
15:43:01 <ndm> you can now compile the runtime with Cmm, or something like that
15:43:06 <tibbe> who's working on it?
15:43:12 <ndm> SimonMar
15:43:14 <eivuokko> ndm, Only almost.

15:44:00 <eivuokko> There's atleast problem with some sign/zero extension on 32bit platforms, and at AngloHaskell SimonM said there was something else as well.
15:44:01 <Phas> d'uh
15:44:05 <Oejet> Related to alunoiemestrado's project.  Is there a way to lift dropWhile into the IO monad, so you can do: dropWhileIO doesFileExist ["abe", "kat", "hund"] => ["hund"], say if abe and kat exists?

15:45:17 <Oejet> dons is in his most productive hour of the day. :-P
15:45:20 <tibbe> what on earth does that mean
15:45:27 <int-e> mapM obviously but that's not lazy.
15:45:43 <SamB> tibbe: what does what mean?
15:46:03 <tibbe> forall a (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => m (m a) -> m a
15:46:20 <SamB> @free M (M a) -> M a

15:46:26 <SamB> @free join :: M (M a) -> M a
15:46:27 <lambdabot> $map_M f . join = join . $map_M ($map_M f)
15:46:50 <tibbe> what does it do?
15:46:59 <xerox> tibbe: think of `m a' as a box of values of type `a'.  `m (m a)' is a box of boxes of values of type `a'.
15:47:17 <xerox> tibbe: join takes the elements of each box in the box of boxes, and constructs with them a box of elements.
15:47:22 <ndm> @google haskell wiki monads as containers
15:47:24 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MonadsAsContainers
15:47:25 <lambdabot> Title: MonadsAsContainers - The Haskell Wiki
15:47:35 <ndm> tibbe: read that
15:47:38 <xerox> Right, that :)
15:47:43 <SamB> @type \p -> do x <- p; x

15:48:05 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *). (MonadPlus m) => Bool -> m ()
15:48:20 <tibbe> so it unwraps on layer of monads?
15:48:31 <xerox> tibbe: it joins ;)
15:48:54 <xerox> tibbe: the implementation of joins describes part of the monad. The other parts are described by map and return.
15:49:05 <tibbe> xerox, perhaps you could explain how join extends to the box metaphore :D
15:49:09 <xerox> tibbe: you can then define bind in terms of join and map.
15:49:18 <SamB> xerox: except that join isn't a member of the Monad class
15:49:24 <xerox> tibbe: that article ndm mentioned explains it.
15:49:30 <tibbe> xerox, ok
15:49:33 <xerox> SamB: that's only a design decision.
15:49:41 <SamB> xerox: yes I know
15:50:06 <SamB> probably because >>= is usually easier to define...
15:50:09 <xerox> tibbe: in fact it gives you the exact same explanation I would have give you now.
15:50:22 <xerox> SamB: it is more convenient to do it in terms of map and join for some monads.
15:50:30 <SamB> or more efficient as a primitive...
15:50:41 <SamB> well, considering that most monads are newtyped function types...
15:50:45 <xerox> Now that's difficult...
15:51:36 <kpreid> Oejet: of course it's *possible*. dropWhileIO f l = mapM (\x -> do r <- f x; (x, r)) l >>= \l' -> return . map fst . dropWhile snd $ l'
15:52:42 <SamB> kpreid: isn't it supposed to stop checking after the predicate returns False?
15:52:43 <Oejet> kpreid, int-e: Yes it seems the strict version is nice, and the lazy version is ugly.
15:53:14 <kpreid> SamB: oops.
15:53:18 <kpreid> hmm
15:54:26 <Oejet> dropWhileIO :: (a -> IO Bool) -> [IO a] -> [IO a]
15:54:40 <kpreid> -> IO [a] surely?
15:55:22 <SamB> xerox: well, for monads like those in the MTL, isn't it more convenient and more efficient to define >>= and return?
15:55:54 <xerox> SamB: I'd say the list one is surely convenient to express in terms of map and concat.
15:56:11 <xerox> No precise idea about the efficiency tough, that's left to GHC for me.
15:56:11 <SamB> yeah
15:56:26 <Oejet> dropWhileIO :: (a -> IO Bool) -> [IO a] -> IO [a]
15:56:42 <SamB> oh, well, what would join look like for, say, State?
15:56:51 <kpreid> dropWhileM f [] = return []
15:56:52 <SamB> newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }
15:56:52 <kpreid> dropWhileM f l@(x:xs) = do r <- f x; if r then dropWhileM f xs else return l
15:56:56 <kpreid> doesn't seem too ugly
15:57:32 <xerox> join :: State s (State s a) -> a
15:58:09 <xerox> Ops.
15:58:12 <xerox> join :: State s (State s a) -> State s a
15:58:30 <SamB> I meant the implementation, silly!
15:58:36 <xerox> One at time.
16:00:32 <SamB> @type \(State f) -> State (\s -> case f of (State g, s') -> g s)
16:00:33 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match `s -> (a, s)' against `(a1, b)'
16:00:34 <lambdabot>    Expected type: s -> (a, s)
16:00:56 <xerox> ?type let join (State f) = State $ \x -> case f x of ((State g),s') -> g s' in join
16:00:57 <lambdabot> forall s a. State s (State s a) -> State s a
16:01:15 <xerox> s/x/s/ :D
16:01:59 <SamB> so what is the definition of >>= in terms of join and fmap?
16:02:18 <xerox> amb >>= f = join (map f amb)
16:02:36 <Oejet> kpreid: Sold!
16:04:01 <SamB> @type let fmap f (State g) = State (\s -> let (x, s') = g s in (f x, s')) in fmap
16:04:02 <lambdabot> forall a a1 s. (a -> a1) -> State s a -> State s a1
16:04:59 <SamB> so what happens when you expand join and map there?
16:06:02 <xerox> You get bind.
16:06:17 <SamB> no, I mean... whats it look like...
16:06:58 <tibbe> @where GetOpt
16:06:58 <lambdabot> I know nothing about getopt.
16:08:32 <xerox> @hoogle GetOpt
16:08:33 <lambdabot> Distribution.GetOpt :: module
16:08:33 <lambdabot> Distribution.GetOpt.getOpt :: ArgOrder a -> [OptDescr a] -> [String] -> ([a], [String], [String])
16:08:33 <lambdabot> Distribution.GetOpt.getOpt' :: ArgOrder a -> [OptDescr a] -> [String] -> ([a], [String], [String], [String])
16:11:24 <chessguy> is normal-order evaluation the same as lazy evaluation?
16:12:04 <xerox> I don't think so.
16:13:30 <SamB> lets see...
16:13:37 <chessguy> so...what's the difference, dare i ask
16:15:11 <SamB> well, well, what do you know...
16:15:20 <SamB> apparantly the code for:
16:15:21 <Frederick> hello
16:15:22 <SamB> bind amb f = join (fmap f amb)
16:15:22 <SamB>     where
16:15:22 <SamB>     join (State f) = State $ \s -> case f s of ((State g), s') -> g s'
16:15:26 <Frederick> Hi SamB ! :)
16:15:44 <SamB> comes out the same as Control.Monad.State.poly_>>=
16:15:53 <SamB> Frederick: hello
16:15:55 <xerox> chessguy: see if foldoc.org can enlighten you
16:17:41 <Frederick> folks does anyone have a more mathematical insigh paper about monads / comonads?
16:17:43 <SamB> xerox: which is kind of nice...
16:18:01 <xerox> SamB: %-)
16:19:18 <SamB> xerox: (though the names come out longer for various reasons)
16:19:52 <SamB> though it looks much nicer if you read the .hi file than if you read the output of -ddump-simpl
16:20:24 <SamB> actually the only name that comes out longer is Control.Monad.State.State
16:21:21 <xerox> Ah.
16:22:21 <SamB> assuming you read the .hi file rather than the -ddump-simpl output
16:23:10 <tibbe> Distribution.GetOpt is listed in the docs but GHCi says it's hidden
16:24:00 <tibbe> how come?
16:25:04 <xerox> tibbe: ghc-pkg list shows Cabal hidden perchance?
16:25:21 <xerox> I.e. in parens.
16:26:04 <SamB> incidentally I think --show-iface is a little broken in 6.4.2

16:27:34 <SamB> or the second thing, for that matter
16:27:47 <Frederick> SamB, nor about monads?
16:27:57 <lispy> SamB: but you're all over that 3rd thing :)
16:28:00 <SamB> no, I don't know the second thing about comonads
16:28:11 <xerox> Ideas about what?
16:28:14 <SamB> lispy: don't know what you are talking about ;-)
16:28:20 <SamB> xerox: papers about monads and comonads...
16:28:34 <tibbe> xerox, it shows two versions, 1.0 inside paranthesis and 1.1.3 without
16:28:35 <musasabi> comonads are cute

16:31:01 <tibbe> xerox, I did a :set -package Cabal-1.1.3 and got: it is hidden (in package Cabal-1.1.3)
16:31:12 <SamB> not "s :: s ->"
16:31:55 <SamB> oh wait, looks like I've 6.4.1
16:32:31 <SamB> xerox: what happens when you compile:

16:32:43 <int-e> are these strictness annotations explained somewhere? what does C(...) mean?
16:32:54 <SamB> and run "ghc --show-iface" on it in 6.4.2?
16:34:16 <xerox> SamB: wait
16:34:41 <xerox> Do you use Control.Monad.State
16:34:48 <xerox> Or a definition, and a Functor instance?
16:35:16 <SamB> xerox: Control.Monad.State and the Functor instance...
16:36:17 <xerox> Should I put it in a Main?
16:36:27 <SamB> well, mine is in a Bind
16:36:54 <xerox> I am not sure what do you feed ghc for show-iface

16:37:52 <SamB> oh, did you build with -O btw?
16:38:10 <SamB> anyway, right before the first let I have

16:38:25 <xerox> Yes, me too.

16:52:05 <tibbe> isn't the Writer monad supposed to accumulate stuff I give it with tell in a list?
16:52:31 <xerox> It depends on the Monoid you are using.
16:52:46 <xerox> That is the case for the list one
16:53:19 <xerox> We have that attitude of generalizing... you know.
16:54:51 <tibbe> I guess I have to learn about monoids too, I was hoping I could just do a Writer [String] a and then append stuff with tell str
16:55:07 <xerox> Nothing strange about them
16:55:37 <xerox> ?type mempty

16:55:46 <xerox> ?type mzero
16:55:51 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a. (MonadPlus m) => m a
16:55:51 <tibbe> the type checker says it expects [String] to tell not [Char]
16:55:53 <xerox> Nah.
16:56:04 <xerox> Right.
16:56:09 <xerox> ?type tell
16:56:29 <xerox> Wake up.. Neo^Wlambdabot.

16:57:09 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) w. (Control.Monad.Writer.MonadWriter w m) => w -> m ()
16:57:19 <xerox> You see, you have to provide a value of the whole type w
16:57:26 <xerox> Where w is the type of the log.
16:57:28 <int-e> looks like you need Writer String
16:57:35 <int-e> or use tell ["message"]
16:57:41 <xerox> The latter, I believe.
16:57:49 <int-e> depends on what you want :)
16:57:51 <xerox> Or unwords . runWriter
16:57:53 <xerox> :D
16:57:55 <tibbe> so it doesn't have appending behaviour?
16:57:59 <xerox> Yes it does.
16:58:10 <int-e> yes, on the type you give the writer
16:58:18 <tibbe> it feels a bit unnatural to use it that way
16:58:24 <SamB> tibbe: a bit, yeah...
16:58:29 <int-e> [String] is a list of strings, and you can append to that

16:59:12 <SamB> dons is in scope
16:59:13 <tibbe> have it been changed since then?
16:59:18 <xerox> SamB: don't say that
16:59:19 <SamB> he just isn't paying attention
16:59:21 <int-e> ((),["hi","there","foo","bar"])
16:59:27 <xerox> Thanks int-e-bot.
16:59:38 <SamB> @get-dons
16:59:38 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
16:59:47 <int-e> You're welcome. Do I get a snack?
16:59:55 <xerox> We are not supposed to even need such a command SamB!

17:03:37 <xerox> Yuck
17:03:39 <aleko> \me is a n00b
17:03:40 <xerox> The last one changes
17:03:41 <SamB> xerox: that isn't the same type!
17:03:43 <xerox> Yes!

17:09:40 <xerox> Let's do a pl contest.
17:09:52 <xerox> (I just said let's do a pointless contest?)
17:09:55 <SamB> what kind of pl contest?
17:10:08 <xerox> One says an expression, people @pl-ify it without @pl.
17:10:16 <SamB> oh
17:10:19 <xerox> First working wins
17:10:35 <xerox> Works better on paper and with computer turned off but well...
17:10:53 <SamB> but how do you tell if it is correct?
17:10:59 <xerox> You try it here?
17:11:01 <jcreigh> SamB: @pl afterword?
17:11:09 <SamB> I meant, with the computer off!
17:11:16 <madpickle> i'm never turning my computer off
17:11:17 <madpickle> i might die
17:11:19 <madpickle> or something.
17:11:21 <xerox> Hm
17:11:21 <SamB> hah
17:11:24 <xerox> You compare with my answer
17:11:26 * xerox coughs
17:11:28 <jcreigh> madpickle: Good point. Why risk it? :)
17:11:30 <tibbe> how can I run a [Writer [String] a] so the result will be a single Writer [String] a?
17:11:32 <madpickle> indeed.

17:11:45 <tibbe> hmm
17:11:45 <madpickle> i'm getting new tubes installed to my internets at my new apartment
17:11:51 <madpickle> but i still gotta go a few days without internets
17:11:52 <tibbe> will sequence do?
17:12:03 <xerox> tibbe, sequence would turn that in Writer [String] [a]
17:12:10 * xerox envisions a pl-resume in the way
17:12:11 <tibbe> :)
17:12:15 <int-e> sorry lambdabot :)
17:12:34 <xerox> Sequence had a nice property.. what was it.
17:12:44 <int-e> you used to give up quicker though, bot.

17:13:41 <xerox> > sequence [even,(>10)] 100

17:15:46 <SamB>  @getshapr -- it only works when he is already here
17:15:52 <beelsebob> yeh, i know

17:16:49 <xerox> ?remember beelsebob > filter isJuggler #haskell
17:16:50 <lambdabot> Done.
17:17:01 <xerox> I am not too good, but yes, i can do up to four balls
17:17:10 <beelsebob> you a mac user too?
17:17:25 <xerox> From something like 3 months yes
17:17:33 <beelsebob> excellent
17:17:39 <beelsebob> I wrote a new shiny
17:18:01 <beelsebob> http://www.icculus.org/jugglemaster/ <-- go here, grab the svn version, and build the project in jugglemaster/src/jmcocoa
17:19:00 <xerox> Build, how?
17:20:01 <xerox> OK loaded in Xcode and compiling now
17:20:02 <beelsebob> XCode
17:20:19 <beelsebob> should build with only "that directory isn't there yet" errors
17:20:35 <xerox> It is working
17:20:39 <beelsebob> :)
17:20:41 <xerox> (No errors)
17:20:44 <xerox> (And running)
17:20:56 <beelsebob> yayness
17:20:58 <beelsebob> you like the shiny?
17:21:00 <xerox> How cool :)
17:21:03 <beelsebob> couple of things won't work yet
17:21:08 <xerox> Mill Mess is nice
17:21:12 <beelsebob> like colouring the balls
17:21:23 <xerox> Centre is more like I can do it
17:21:33 <beelsebob> or choosing a pattern from a list
17:21:41 <beelsebob> any ideas for it much appreciated
17:21:56 <beelsebob> I will probably do export to movie, and add music and stuffs
17:22:02 <xerox> Write it in Haskell?
17:22:08 <beelsebob> hehe
17:22:09 <beelsebob> I would
17:22:12 <beelsebob> but HOC sucks
17:22:13 <xerox> How does it draw?
17:22:16 <xerox> Does it? Sigh.
17:22:19 <beelsebob> it hasn't been updated in *ages*
17:22:28 <xerox> Pang contacted me for SoC, he had lked a project to do a Cocoa monad.
17:22:32 <beelsebob> like, since 10.3 first came out
17:22:40 <beelsebob> SoC?
17:22:41 <xerox> Sorry I can't type.
17:22:44 <xerox> Summer of Code
17:22:54 <beelsebob> ah yeh
17:22:59 <beelsebob> that would be a shiny idea
17:23:04 <xerox> Yes but it is over now
17:23:09 <beelsebob> indeed
17:23:19 <xerox> Maybe next year, but I'd rather try to get people involved even without grants
17:23:37 <beelsebob> makes sense
17:23:39 <xerox> Mills mess looks crazy with 6 balls
17:23:43 <beelsebob> hehe, yes
17:23:46 <beelsebob> do mills with 9
17:23:51 <xerox> Is Centre possible with an even number of balls?
17:23:56 <beelsebob> not sure
17:24:00 <xerox> Infinite!
17:24:06 <beelsebob> infinite?
17:24:15 <beelsebob> oh... mills with 9
17:24:26 <xerox> It shapes an ‚àû
17:24:33 <beelsebob> or... if you want something shiny do [123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]
17:24:43 <xerox> In the number?
17:24:44 <beelsebob> [] makes it multiplex all the throws
17:24:47 <beelsebob> yep
17:24:48 <xerox> Hmm.
17:25:00 <xerox> [1] is silly
17:25:06 <beelsebob> haha
17:25:09 <xerox> Look is here! No it's over there!
17:25:21 <beelsebob> (,) makes it do the left one in the left hand, and the right one in the right hand
17:25:52 <beelsebob> you tried [123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]?
17:25:57 * tibbe wonders why GetOpt won't play nice with him
17:26:00 <beelsebob> the 640 ball pattern!
17:26:14 <xerox> A fountain!!
17:26:36 <xerox> What do you use to draw it?
17:26:37 <beelsebob> hehe
17:26:39 <beelsebob> cocoa
17:26:52 <xerox> Oh.
17:26:54 <beelsebob> which in turn uses Quartz
17:27:06 <xerox> I see.
17:27:18 <xerox> I want to be able to Haskell for that job.....
17:27:19 <beelsebob> NSBezierPath for the most part
17:27:41 <xerox> Does Xcode make universal binaries?
17:27:50 <beelsebob> that project is set up to make one, yes
17:28:36 <xerox> An example of (,) ?
17:28:43 <beelsebob> (k,k)
17:28:49 <xerox> Doesn't work
17:28:53 <beelsebob> no?
17:29:03 <xerox> Stays (!)
17:29:04 <beelsebob> works here
17:29:19 <beelsebob> I get synchronous lots of balls
17:29:31 <beelsebob> (4,4) gives you synchronous 4s
17:29:40 <xerox> I was trying too small numbers
17:29:47 <xerox> It should be able to do 3
17:29:50 <xerox> And 2 too
17:30:32 <beelsebob> it can do 2
17:30:37 <beelsebob> just a 2 is a ball held in a hand
17:30:42 <xerox> hehe
17:30:49 <beelsebob> and it can't do odd numbers for that because they would colide
17:30:53 <xerox> No single up and down?
17:31:20 <beelsebob> that's a 4
17:31:30 <beelsebob> oh, I see what you mean
17:31:38 <beelsebob> no, there's no such throw
17:31:42 <beelsebob> there's no point in throwing it
17:31:46 <beelsebob> try ([44x],[44x])
17:32:06 <xerox> Cool.
17:32:08 <xerox> x has special meaning?
17:32:23 <beelsebob> if it falls in certian places
17:32:26 <beelsebob> it means cross this throw
17:32:51 <xerox> [44x] is like a humming bird juggling
17:32:51 <beelsebob> so it does a height 4 throw crossed to the other hand
17:32:56 <beelsebob> yep
17:33:24 <xerox> ([22x],[44x]) seems decentered hehe
17:34:20 <syntaxfree> You know you're beginning to lose it when you try to use map and zipWith on a ftp prompt.
17:34:24 <xerox> ([242x],[242x])
17:34:26 <xerox> This is fun!

18:07:49 <syntaxfree> how do I get that fixed?
18:08:04 <xerox> syntaxfree: just stick a `unsafeInterleaveIO' in the front of the IO action you want to make lazy.

19:12:22 <int-e> xerox: the only thing the mfix does in addition to fix is sneak one constant into the calculation that you can provide later.
19:12:31 <int-e> xerox: in the case of (->) a
19:12:56 <xerox> int-e: that's true
19:13:02 <xerox> int-e: but since it is a constant..... ?
19:13:28 <xerox> let r = .. in fix f -- should be equivalent
19:13:29 <int-e> you have to get your variables elsewhere :)
19:13:53 <int-e> let r = fix (flip f r)  is equivalent
19:13:58 <int-e> err ... in
19:14:22 <xerox> No I don't mean the type
19:14:34 <int-e> the constant is the second argument to f.
19:14:40 <xerox> I know, but do you need it?
19:14:51 <int-e> what do you mean, need?
19:15:09 <xerox> I see that you can do that
19:15:19 <xerox> But let r = .. in fix f is the same thing, since r is constant anyway
19:15:45 <int-e> well, in the same sense as the Reader Monad is superfluous.
19:16:06 <xerox> Mumble.
19:16:29 <int-e> if you ask me whether I have a good use for mfix in that monad, the answer is no.
19:16:44 <int-e> except that it might come in handy for mdo.

19:48:17 <lambdabot>  Hello.
19:48:17 <jcreigh> I don't quite understand the point of $...I mean, it's defined f $ x = f x, but how is it generally used?
19:48:24 <Pseudonym> @read "\fHello."
19:48:24 <lambdabot>  Hello.
19:48:30 <Pseudonym> Cool.
19:48:51 <dons> things like, handle (\e -> ..) $ do .. some huge multi line expression
19:49:05 <dons> you don't want to try to match up the parens 20 lines down
19:49:24 <Pseudonym> Also f (g (h x)) can be written (f . g . h) x or f . g . h $ x
19:49:29 <Pseudonym> The latter is more elegant.
19:49:45 <int-e> dons: didn't you have some basic list functionality, cons or something?
19:49:49 <lispy> or f $ g $ h x
19:49:57 <dons> int-e, on ++ now
19:50:04 <Pseudonym> Except f $ g $ h x highlights why the associativity of $ is wrong.
19:50:11 <Pseudonym> But that's another rant.
19:50:13 <dons> int-e, you want to accumulate stuff in the state?
19:50:21 <lispy> Pseudonym: hmm...how so?
19:50:33 <int-e> actually I want to get rid of a \n
19:50:45 <dons> init?
19:50:48 <Pseudonym> lispy: The fact that f $ g $ h $ x is the same as f . g . h $ x highlights some redundancy.
19:50:52 <Pseudonym> But the main reason is this.
19:51:00 <Pseudonym> Suppose you have a three-argument function.
19:51:02 <Pseudonym> f x y z
19:51:02 <int-e> hah. init: not enough privileges
19:51:20 <lispy> int-e: heh, wrong init?
19:51:21 <Pseudonym> Being a good functional programmer, you order your arguments in rough De Brujin order.
19:51:29 <Pseudonym> The more "constant" arguments go first.
19:51:29 <int-e> @init "abc"
19:51:30 <lambdabot> Not enough privileges
19:51:35 <lispy> Pseudonym: which means?
19:51:36 <Pseudonym> @init "abc"
19:51:37 <lispy> ah
19:51:40 <dons> no no, I mean init the @run function
19:51:40 <Pseudonym> Oops.
19:51:45 <SamB> @. read > Nothing
19:51:55 <Pseudonym> lispy: Consider map, for example.
19:51:59 <Pseudonym> map f [] = []
19:52:02 <lispy> Pseudonym: yeah, i understand now
19:52:03 <int-e> woops
19:52:05 <Pseudonym> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
19:52:07 <SamB> oh oops
19:52:08 <Pseudonym> f is effectively constant.
19:52:08 <int-e> poor lambdabot
19:52:12 <lispy> Pseudonym: makes it easier to partialy apply
19:52:22 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:52:23 <Pseudonym> Now.
19:52:26 <int-e> @. ++ . show . state . eval . state read "@. ++ . state . eval state read"
19:52:27 <dons> what doesn't kill here makes her stronger
19:52:44 <SamB> @. read > show Nothing
19:52:46 <int-e> this is why, it's close but the \n-s kill it.
19:52:50 <Pseudonym> Let's suppose that being a practical functional programmer, you want to evaluate the first argument of f strictly.
19:52:55 <lambdabot>  @. ++ . state . eval state read
19:52:57 <lambdabot> " @. ++ . state . eval state read\n\n"
19:53:03 <lambdabot> compose module failed: IRCRaised Parse error: ">"
19:53:05 <Pseudonym> Suppose the strictness analyser can't work out that it's strict, say.
19:53:14 <Pseudonym> x `seq` f x y z
19:53:15 <SamB> dons: aww
19:53:20 <SamB> @. read eval show Nothing
19:53:20 <lambdabot> compose module failed: IRCRaised Prelude.read: no parse
19:53:26 <SamB> oh, right, I get it...
19:53:28 <lispy> Pseudonym: okay
19:53:39 <Pseudonym> Let's further suppose that x is a complicated expression.
19:53:43 <SamB> @eval show Nothing
19:53:49 <Pseudonym> let x = complicated expression in x `seq` f x y z
19:53:52 <dons> int-e, do you mean to use 'run' when you're typing 'eval'..?
19:53:58 <dons> and that goes for SamB too
19:54:01 <int-e> dons: no
19:54:05 <dons> ok
19:54:07 <Pseudonym> If ($) and ($!) were left-associative, you could do this:
19:54:10 <SamB> dons: what is the equivalent of >
19:54:13 <int-e> dons: I use run to get an empty argument for state
19:54:17 <Pseudonym> f $! complicated expression $ y $ z
19:54:20 <dons> ah
19:54:34 <Pseudonym> But $! and $ are right-associative.
19:54:42 <Pseudonym> So you can't actually do this.
19:54:51 <lispy> Pseudonym: hmm...don't youmean f $! complitade expression y z ?
19:54:54 <syntaxfree> what is ($!)?
19:55:02 <Pseudonym> lispy: No.
19:55:03 <lispy> syntaxfree: like ($) but strict
19:55:10 <syntaxfree> how so?
19:55:11 <Pseudonym> Because $! has low precedence.
19:55:19 <Pseudonym> That's parsed as f $! (complicated expression y z)
19:55:26 <Pseudonym> Regardless of the associativity of $!.
19:55:27 <int-e> @. read id 1
19:55:27 <lambdabot> compose module failed: IRCRaised Prelude.read: no parse
19:55:27 <lispy> okay
19:55:32 <int-e> @. show id 1
19:55:32 <lambdabot> "1\n"
19:55:38 <int-e> @. show . id id 1
19:55:38 <lambdabot> "1\n"
19:55:46 <Pseudonym> So $! is actually optimised for strictifying the _last_ argument to a function.
19:55:58 <Pseudonym> Which if you use De Brujin ordering is the _least_ likely argument that needs it.
19:56:01 <lispy> Pseudonym: so could you just define infixl 4 $'; ($') = ($)  ?
19:56:15 <Pseudonym> Chances are the last argument of a function has a top-level case switch or something.
19:56:34 <syntaxfree> strictifying??
19:56:48 * Pseudonym made that word up. Sorry.
19:57:25 <syntaxfree> it's not about the word.
19:57:30 <Pseudonym> So here's the summary about $ and $!'s associativity.
19:57:30 <syntaxfree> I don't understand ($!)
19:57:48 <Pseudonym> 1. It's maximally non-useful.
19:57:50 <lispy> f $! x = x `seq` f x
19:57:51 <Pseudonym> 2. It's redundant.
19:58:11 <lispy> syntaxfree: does that help?
19:58:17 <Pseudonym> If they were left-associative, they would be more useful and less redundant.
19:58:35 * syntaxfree doesn't know seq
19:58:37 <syntaxfree> @type seq
19:58:39 <lambdabot> forall b a. a -> b -> b
19:58:44 <SamB> the type is useless
19:58:44 * syntaxfree dies
19:58:51 <Pseudonym> ?free seq :: forall b a. a -> b -> b
19:58:51 <lambdabot> f . seq x = seq (g x) . f
19:58:53 <lispy> Pseudonym: but you could define $' and $!' to be the left-associative versions right?
19:59:00 <Pseudonym> Yes, you could.
19:59:06 <SamB> Pseudonym: it isn't true is it?
19:59:13 <Pseudonym> SamB: Yes it is.
19:59:16 <Pseudonym> More or less.
19:59:23 <Pseudonym> Actually it's true if g is strict.
19:59:35 <syntaxfree> one could use the euro symbol for left-associative $.
19:59:41 <lispy> syntaxfree: basically, a `seq` b, means evaluate a when b is needed
19:59:42 <jcreigh> syntaxfree: lol
19:59:50 <Pseudonym> What seq does is evaluates its first argument, throws it away then returns the second argument.
20:00:05 <syntaxfree> ummmm. strict!

20:09:07 <lispy> @vixen are you afraid of the halting problem?
20:09:07 <lambdabot> yes, i am

20:11:01 <lambdabot> wanna hear a story?
20:11:08 <lispy> @vixen tell me a story
20:11:08 <lambdabot> i forgot the story now

20:11:15 <aleko> heh
20:11:33 <SamB> @vixen do you enjoy programming?
20:11:33 <lambdabot> uhh, how can i be a program??
20:11:47 <SamB> @vixen thats not what I asked you!
20:11:48 <lambdabot> i understand
20:11:56 <SamB> @vixen I don't think you do
20:11:57 <lambdabot> Ok
20:12:00 <aleko> @vixen spew unhelpful errors at users and generate hundreds of bug reports
20:12:00 <lambdabot> what were you saying?
20:12:07 <SamB> @vixen okay what
20:12:07 <lambdabot> okey-dokie
20:12:25 <SamB> @vixen what were you saying?
20:12:25 <lambdabot> i dunno, was i doing that?

20:16:44 <aleko> just out of curiosity, is it possible to partially evaluate a function using only the second argument?  like with a -> b -> c and only supplying the b argument
20:17:19 <lispy> yeah
20:17:23 <aleko> how?

20:18:41 <aleko> kinky
20:18:53 <Pseudonym> aleko: You should be aware, though, that it probably won't be partially evaluated.
20:18:58 <Pseudonym> Just partially applied.
20:19:11 * aleko doesn't know the difference
20:19:22 <Pseudonym> And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you should use de Brujin ordering on your arguments in the first place.
20:19:43 <lispy> Pseudonym: partially evaluated would mean it was partially computed and the answer can be retried when the details become available
20:19:47 <lispy> er sorry
20:19:52 <lispy> meant that to aleko
20:20:03 <Pseudonym> 'Sokay.
20:20:05 <lispy> retried should be retrieved
20:20:10 * lispy can't type
20:20:14 <aleko> i see. then i meant partially applied in the first place
20:20:19 * lispy retires the keyboard ;)
20:20:42 * aleko can't read irc and program at the same time
20:20:59 <Pseudonym> In a lazy language, you can partially evaluate at run-time if you're careful how you write your function.

21:05:53 <dons> good idea, int-e
21:05:59 <dons> we've had some other good @state programs
21:07:53 <jcreigh> Hmmm...I can't get Haskell to accept this definition of show for "SudokuBoard": http://paste.lisp.org/display/24665
21:09:21 <int-e> wow
21:09:30 <int-e> you mean type instead of data at the top I think :)
21:09:56 <dons> yeah
21:10:32 <int-e> you definitely do not want to define your own data constructor named 'Array' :)
21:11:32 <int-e> data SudokuBoard = SB (Array (Int,Int) SudokuCell)   and   show (SB board) = fol...   makes it work
21:11:42 <int-e> and you can use newtype instead of data there
21:13:24 <int-e> type isn't good after all, because type aliases aren't allowed in instance heads (in Haskell 98) and also array comes with its own Show instance.
21:13:37 <Tela> This might be a really silly question.. But in trying to compile lambdabot, I needed to update FPS. Now, however, it complains that Data.ByteString.Char8 is found in two packages (base and fps-0.8) and thus stops there.
21:14:08 <dons> ah you have ghc 6.5
21:14:11 <int-e> remove fps from the cabal file's dependencies
21:14:24 <dons> yep.
21:14:25 <Tela> Heh. Yep...
21:14:37 <Tela> mmk
21:14:40 <dons> the standalone fps package is only for the 6.4.x series of ghc
21:15:10 * int-e wonders if there's any chance to get fps out of the base package? using the standalone fps won't be possible anymore with 6.6 otherwise, without major trouble.
21:15:40 <dons> but there's no reason to use the standalone fps now
21:15:46 <dons> well, in 30 minutes or so anyway
21:15:51 <dons> since base and fps will be in sync
21:16:11 <dons> otherwise, hopefully this new package stuff should make things work
21:16:18 <dons> though i've not tested that
21:18:17 <jcreigh> int-e: Thanks, that works.
21:18:30 <jcreigh> So data types *always* have to have a constructor?
21:18:40 <int-e> I guess there are conflicting goals here. on the one hand, a large base package makes it easy for users, on the other hand it makes it hard to replace parts of that package ...
21:18:43 <int-e> jcreigh: right
21:18:57 <dons> int-e, the argument for fps being in base is that (already) many core libs use it
21:20:30 <dons> so, maybe that's a reasonable thing. the invconveniences should only be temporary
21:20:51 <jcreigh> The idea being that without a constructor, there's nothing to pattern match on?
21:21:22 <int-e> jcreigh: the idea being that without the constructor it's impossible to derive the proper type
21:24:08 <int-e> SB (array ...) has a different type from just (array ...). If you want a type alias, you can use 'type' but that will prevent you from defining the Show instance you want.
21:27:50 <jcreigh> Ah, right, otherwise there's no way for Haskell to tell the difference...
21:31:22 <jcreigh> Now I just need to make it fast enough to solve puzzles that require backtracking in finite time...
21:31:23 <syntaxfree> is there an advantage in using Hugs over GHCi?
21:32:16 <syntaxfree> unsafePerformIO:: IO a -> a :-O :-O
21:32:20 <int-e> the reasons I've heard are that hugs loads faster and gives somewhat better error messages.
21:32:24 <syntaxfree> OH.
21:32:40 <syntaxfree> that's ... HERESY!
21:32:59 <int-e> which?
21:33:10 <syntaxfree> unsafePerformIO
21:33:14 <syntaxfree> I want to forget it exists.
21:33:21 <int-e> unsafePerformIO is unsafe. There should be some emphasis on that.
21:33:28 <syntaxfree> It's ruining my whole conception of truth and beauty.
21:33:39 <syntaxfree> I might sink into depression because of unsafePerformIO.
21:33:47 <syntaxfree> unsafePerformIO should be banned by the FDA.
21:33:55 <int-e> unsafePerformIO_rememberThisReallyIsUnsafeWeKidYouNot
21:34:12 <syntaxfree> it's ... UGLY.
21:34:31 <monochrom> import Unsafe.ThinkTwice.AreYouSure.ItIsReallyUnsafe(unsafePerformIO)
21:34:44 <monochrom> Oh I have a better idea.
21:35:27 <int-e> it is, however, occasionally useful.
21:35:38 <monochrom> import You.Have.Selected.An.Unsafe.Backdoor.Are.You.Sure.To.Proceed.Yes.No.Cancel(unsafePerformIO)
21:35:49 <syntaxfree> I feel my world is collapsing.
21:35:49 <int-e> you just shouldn't use it for the obvious thing, namely, making IO actions pure.
21:35:54 <JohnMeacham> there is nothing in particular wrong with it other than it shifts a lot of the burden of proof of correctness onto the user rather the language.
21:35:57 <syntaxfree> IO a->a shouldn't exist.
21:36:00 <syntaxfree> No! No! No!
21:36:04 <SamB> how about import Foreign (unsafePerformIO)
21:36:04 <flux__> the compiler should simply prompt the user each time it compiles code involving unsafePerformIO.
21:36:18 <SamB> flux__: nah...
21:36:20 <flux__> maybe something like the web sites use..
21:36:21 <int-e> syntaxfree: Haskell isn't really pure. So?
21:36:22 <SamB> what about libraries?
21:36:32 <JohnMeacham> oh course, using it when you don't need to is just wrong.
21:36:32 <syntaxfree> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo!
21:36:45 <dons> ?free unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
21:36:45 <lambdabot> f . unsafePerformIO = unsafePerformIO . $map_IO f
21:36:46 <monochrom> Relax!
21:37:07 <flux__> anyway, how do you implement something like lazy reading of file without unsafePerformIO?
21:37:11 <int-e> that seems to be true, dons :)
21:37:15 <SamB> syntaxfree: so we support the ability to define libraries that are usable and yet use the IO monad behind the scenes
21:37:22 <dons> flux__: with unsafeInterleaveIO
21:37:23 <JohnMeacham> it isn't used because users don't like burdens of proof. that is why they use haskell in the first place.
21:37:31 <SamB> also, the ability to call C functions that need complicated marshalling
21:37:37 <flux__> dons, well that's just unsafePerformIO in disguise?-)
21:37:44 <dons> not quite
21:37:45 <syntaxfree> NO! NO! NO!
21:37:55 <monochrom> Is this an opera?
21:37:56 * syntaxfree curls into a fetal position
21:37:57 <Lemmih> dons: How do you implement unsafeInterleaveIO without unsafePerformIO?
21:38:01 <dons> its not as unsafe
21:38:04 <int-e> syntaxfree: maybe you should look for a more academic language?
21:38:07 <SamB> flux__: you can't unsafeInterleaveIO from outside the IO monad
21:38:08 * int-e grins
21:38:22 <syntaxfree> I though the world was beautiful :'(
21:38:25 <flux__> but, whathesaid
21:38:27 <SamB> syntaxfree: it is
21:38:28 <dons> Lemmih: well, you still have to step inside the monad either way
21:38:37 <SamB> that is why we use the word "unsafe" for things like this
21:38:40 <dons> unsafeInterleaveIO :: IO a -> IO a
21:38:40 <dons> unsafeInterleaveIO (IO m)
21:38:40 <dons>   = IO ( \ s -> let
21:38:40 <dons>            r = case m s of (# _, res #) -> res
21:38:40 <dons>         in
21:38:42 <dons>         (# s, r #))
21:38:48 <dons> look ma, no unsafePerformIO :)
21:38:50 <monochrom> What's wrong with unsafePerformIO?
21:38:52 <int-e> syntaxfree: you are lucky, you have libraries that do the unsafePerformIO for you.
21:38:58 <dons> monochrom: you can create segfaults
21:39:04 <syntaxfree> int-e: huh?
21:39:07 <SamB> dons: did you just translate that from Core?
21:39:08 <syntaxfree> Which ones? :'(
21:39:11 <int-e> syntaxfree: and a kind advice to you, never look at GHC.IO and related libraries :)
21:39:11 <monochrom> segfaults are beautiful :)
21:39:18 <dons> SamB, no , that's the actual definitions
21:39:23 <SamB> o rly?
21:39:23 <madpickle> ya rly!
21:39:39 <SamB> fast answer!
21:39:48 * syntaxfree screams like Ozzy in "Black Sabbath", the song.
21:39:53 <SamB> thats some split-second reflexes!
21:40:10 <int-e> dons: that's nasty though, it's throwing away a world!
21:40:10 <monochrom> this is an opera
21:40:28 <int-e> dons: maybe that world would have evolved intelligent life otherwise, sniff.
21:40:35 <dons> heh
21:40:54 <dons> not as bad as :
21:40:55 <dons> unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
21:40:56 <dons> unsafePerformIO (IO m) = lazy (case m realWorld# of (# _, r #) -> r)
21:41:00 <SamB> int-e: its not a real world!
21:41:11 <dons> at least you get a world back in unsafeInterleaveIO
21:41:11 <syntaxfree> STOP! :'(
21:41:15 <monochrom> <SamB> Oh really?  <madpickle> Ya really! <syntaxfree> No no no no no!   <--- perfect for Mozartian opera music :)
21:41:33 <syntaxfree> KILL unsafePerformIO BEFORE IT KILLS ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD ABOUT THE WORLD!
21:41:36 <SamB> monochrom: why are you misquoting me?
21:41:47 <monochrom> To fit the music :)
21:41:47 <SamB> I said, and I quote, "o rly"
21:41:59 <SamB> syntaxfree: ah
21:42:02 <int-e> syntaxfree: the irony is, all that stuff allows you to do IO in purely functional code ;)
21:42:11 <monochrom> "really" is Italian for "rly" ok? :)
21:42:18 <SamB> syntaxfree: don't you like your packed strings?
21:42:26 <SamB> monochrom: I thought it was english
21:42:28 <syntaxfree> packed strings?
21:42:29 <int-e> syntaxfree: granted the 'pure' may be a bit distorted in that context.
21:42:37 <SamB> syntaxfree: bytestrings, whatever
21:42:43 * syntaxfree uses no damn ByteStrings, he uses Lists of Chars as God intended.
21:42:52 <int-e> diffarrays?
21:42:53 <SamB> also it is useful for Debug.Trace
21:42:53 <monochrom> Pardon my French.
21:43:04 <int-e> what about the st monad?
21:43:17 <SamB> God has a lot more RAM than I do. and a better frontside bus...
21:43:21 <int-e> in GHC that's IO in disguise :)
21:43:29 <SamB> or backside or whatever side the RAM is on
21:43:32 <int-e> and you have runST ...
21:43:34 <SamB> int-e: shush
21:43:42 <SamB> int-e: it is not really IO
21:43:48 <newsham> god doesnt use a "frontside bus"
21:43:54 <SamB> it just has the same shape in memory
21:43:57 <newsham> no northbridge or southbridge either
21:44:07 <SamB> well yah
21:44:10 <SamB> cloud trams and all
21:44:21 <newsham> ia32 is of the devil.
21:44:33 <syntaxfree> we should have Haskell Machines by now.
21:44:45 <int-e> oh, we have unsafeInterleaveST, too.
21:44:47 <monochrom> Can it do I/O? :)
21:44:48 <newsham> does ocaml support partial application like hsakell does?
21:44:53 * int-e dances merrily
21:45:02 <dons> newsham: surely it does?
21:45:06 <monochrom> Yes, it does.
21:45:23 <syntaxfree> Closures in Lisp are partial application of sorts too, right?
21:45:44 <dons> you implement partial application with closures.
21:45:44 <newsham> nifty, so if I get fed up (or bogged down) with monads, I can take refuge in ocaml and get most of the features?
21:45:45 <sieni> well whatever you want to call them
21:46:02 <sieni> it's just spanking the lambda
21:46:10 <newsham> sf: yah, i can implement partial application in python, too, but the syntax makes it a pain to use
21:46:12 <jcreigh> newsham: Hmm...are you saying God is a RISC guy, then? Or just not ia32?
21:46:27 <monochrom> Or if you get fed up with the absence of the do notation, you can take refuge in haskell and get more features.
21:46:29 <newsham> jcreigh: i'm just saying that IA32 is unholy.
21:46:38 * syntaxfree do notation considered harmful
21:46:45 <syntaxfree> just say no to do!
21:46:46 <Tela> it's pretty trivial to implement some degree of partial application in lisp with closures and macros
21:46:52 <sieni> like (lambda x (apply + 17 x))
21:46:54 <dons> > let f x y z = x ++ y ++ z in let g = f "haskell " in let h = g "is " in h "fun!"
21:46:56 <lambdabot>  "haskell is fun!"
21:47:11 <newsham> tela: yah, but lisp is ho hum.. i'd rather python given lisp v. python.
21:47:21 <newsham> even though macros are a nice bonus
21:47:22 <dons> > let f x y z = x ++ y ++ z in let g = f "haskell " in let h = g "is " in h "fun!" ++ " and " ++ h "coo!"
21:47:23 <lambdabot>  "haskell is fun! and haskell is coo!"
21:47:32 <monochrom> what is coo?
21:47:37 <dons> a typo
21:47:38 <sieni> newsham: but python sucks
21:47:42 <syntaxfree> @google coo

21:48:32 <int-e> hmm. stToIO (ST m) = IO m ... close enough :)
21:48:46 <sieni> maybe I need some coffee before I make more statements

21:49:01 <syntaxfree> "Simon is an incredibly lively and entertaining speaker; he puts real drama in his presentations. I wish I could speak like that! Like Python, Haskell uses indentation for blocks; after that, the similarities stop. It is a strongly typed pure functional language, where just about everything is written as recursive functions, because the language has no looping construct. Because of this it will probably always remain a language of mostly academic int
21:49:18 <dons> heh
21:49:39 <syntaxfree> Guido van Rossum seems to forget *induction* is a natural reasoning mode, and recursion is pretty much co-induction.
21:50:07 <int-e> a language of mostly academic in...?
21:50:27 <monochrom> GvR is very narrow-minded.
21:50:28 <Tela> I mentioned FP to my CS teacher. He nearly had a heart attack and then tried to exorcise me. :)
21:50:40 <syntaxfree> "...mostly academic interest: loops may be theoretically inferior to recursion, but I have no doubt that the human brain has special reasoning abilities for loops, and many real-world problems are most naturally expressed using loops rather than recursion. I'd say that a loop is a higher-level concept than recursion; recursion is more powerful, but also more low-level, like assembly language."
21:50:44 <jcreigh> Tela: Really? Why?
21:50:49 <syntaxfree> I have a buddy who is in CS grad school.
21:50:53 <Tela> Bad experience with Scheme from what I gathered.
21:50:54 <syntaxfree> He's a Prolog Nazi.

21:51:23 <lambdabot> Done.
21:51:30 <dons> yeah, pretty low :)
21:51:33 <syntaxfree> Python has higher-order functions, PHP doesn't. God knows I've needed that.

21:51:37 <lambdabot> sieni's karma raised to 2.
21:51:44 <syntaxfree> Guido wants to remove most FP constructs from the next Python.
21:51:55 <syntaxfree> How are you gonna write functions that return functions without a lambda keyword?
21:52:06 <int-e> hmm, loops. if I want loops it usually ends up being a map, fold or filter.
21:52:07 <dons> unlambda seems to manage
21:52:11 <Tela> by using unsafeLambda ;)
21:52:18 <newsham> syntax: what?  lambda?  so?  lambda in python is extraneous and very limited anyway.     filter()?  map()?  who cares, write your own.
21:52:28 <newsham> I dont see what you rpoint is.
21:52:48 <newsham> syntax: nested functions give you lambdas (with names).
21:52:55 <syntaxfree> functions that return functions.
21:52:58 <newsham> see url I pasted for example.
21:53:10 <int-e> syntaxfree: he wants that? oh my and I was liking python ...
21:53:11 <syntaxfree> That's the feature I miss the most in languages without a lambda of sorts.
21:53:19 <newsham> the pipeline() function returns a function created by reducing the compose function.
21:53:36 <monochrom> Many burger-flipping problems are most naturally expressed using loops than recursion, that's for sure.
21:53:55 <syntaxfree> I remember when I used a lot of Matlab.
21:53:58 <newsham> I dont understand the complaints about lambda....
21:54:01 <syntaxfree> I learned to express loops as matrix multiplications.
21:54:06 <int-e> instead generators are evolving into coroutines.
21:54:11 <dons> foreach xs a = mapM_ a xs ; foreach [1..10] (print 'x')
21:54:15 <dons> yay for loops

21:54:38 <flux__> syntaxfree, even php sort of has higher order functions, but they basically work via eval :-)
21:54:55 <newsham> flux: you're just being silly.
21:54:59 <syntaxfree> flux__: well, passing functions as arguments, yes. returning functions from functions, no.
21:55:09 <Tela> syntaxfree: Hm. I'll have to learn that trick sometime. I'm about to jump into a bunch of Matlab
21:55:09 <syntaxfree> I need functions that return functions.
21:55:12 <syntaxfree> I can't do work without that.
21:55:24 <flux__> I've used that technique ;)
21:55:32 <syntaxfree> Tela: use GNU R instead. Way nicer.
21:55:36 <monochrom> You can return a string that can be eval'ed later... :)
21:55:37 <flux__> create_function (?) creates new functions and returns the name
21:55:47 <Tela> syntaxfree: It's a class. Sadly I have no choice :S
21:55:54 <int-e> dons: yes, I think we agreed some time ago that  flip mapM_  should have its own name.
21:56:04 <jcreigh> flux__: PHP has anonymous functions, *not* closures.
21:56:08 <newsham> flapM_ ?
21:56:13 <dons> int-e, yes. I agree
21:56:13 <flux__> it input is a string.. so you need to embed local variables into it
21:56:14 <syntaxfree> int-e: what about flipMapM_?
21:56:15 <int-e> forM probably
21:56:20 <dons> forM is good
21:56:28 <int-e> syntaxfree: flipflapflop ... ah no, that was INTERCAL
21:56:31 <dons> also, we don't have repeatM/foreverM
21:56:34 <dons> which is another one
21:56:39 <monochrom> I like forM too
21:56:40 <flux__> jcreigh, true, but closures can be emulated with great pain by generating the code dynamically :)
21:56:46 <int-e> unfoldM
21:56:55 <flux__> of course, such functions are not candidates for garbage collection
21:57:14 <newsham> flux: sure, and you could write an interpretter since its turing complete.. but surely you two are getting off point on this...
21:57:22 <dons> int-e, you could just about get forM into ghc 6.6 if you submitted a patch today or tomorrow
21:57:25 <flux__> newsham, well, it's still less painful than in, say, C
21:57:31 <dons> to Control.Monad
21:57:31 <syntaxfree> "Sometimes I've been too quick in accepting contributions, and later realized that it was a mistake. One example would be some of the functional programming features, such as lambda functions. lambda is a keyword that lets you create a small anonymous function; built-in functions such as map, filter, and reduce run a function over a sequence type, such as a list."
21:57:40 <dons> syntaxfree: stop quoting large chunks
21:57:43 <syntaxfree> ok!
21:57:51 <jcreigh> flux__: Which doesn't change the fact that PHP sucks in so many ways.
21:57:59 <flux__> obviously doesn't
21:58:03 <int-e> syntaxfree: provide URLs :)
21:58:18 <newsham> flux: nah, not so hard in C.  define environment object, define variable accessors, define function objects, build closures, tada, done.

21:58:41 <syntaxfree> Where GVR talks about getting rid of FP features in Python.
21:58:44 <flux__> newsham, yeah, but that involves writing code everywhere in addition the place you're actually using it
21:58:49 <newsham> oh no!  remove reduce?!@  however will we replace it with our own version?
21:59:00 <newsham> I dont really like python reduce anyway, since its left-fold only.
21:59:39 <newsham> reduce, filter and map are all replaceable.. who cares if guido takes them out of the std lib.
21:59:49 <syntaxfree> he wants to remove lambda.
22:00:00 <int-e> ow, he has trouble understanding fold?
22:00:10 <newsham> so what?  the lambda expression isnt even a statement!  nested-functions make better lambdas in python anyway
22:00:11 <monochrom> Let him.  Python is replaceable anyway.  We can use Haskell.
22:00:31 <newsham> syntax: you're only complaining because its called "lambda", its not even the real lambda.. nested functions are.
22:00:56 <newsham> lambda in python is completely unnecessary
22:01:16 * syntaxfree 's been  using Haskell even for small shell scripts.
22:01:24 <flux__> newsham, actually sort-of-usable currying is writeable to c
22:01:28 <newsham> thats cool, haskell is great..
22:02:32 <syntaxfree> GvR often seems to imply that all relevant language decisions are a matter of syntax.
22:02:49 <syntaxfree> It seems that his idea of "features" is syntactic sugar.
22:02:53 <newsham> nested functions are equivalent to lambdas with the caveat that you have to provide a name (inconvenient, at best,  added documentary value at times)
22:03:10 <dons> understanding programming language theory isn't a requirement for writing a new language, obviously
22:03:12 <int-e> lambda is the only thing of these that's not easily rewritten in an own module
22:03:12 <newsham> sf: why the obsession with gvr?
22:03:23 * int-e shrugs
22:03:34 <syntaxfree> because GvR is evil, and therefore Python is evil.
22:03:43 <dons> and so our industry struggles on with poor tools
22:03:46 <monochrom> My opinion is if you write like "z := f(a,g(b,c))" instead of "begin var tmp; g(tmp,b,c); f(z,a,tmp); end" you are already doing very basic functional programming.  If you want to remove FP you must eventually confine the programmer to the latter.  Now talk about assembly programming.
22:04:08 <newsham> int-e: and whats wrong with:    def dot(f, g) : def comp(x) : return f(g(x))    return dot   ?
22:04:11 * johnnowak giggles
22:04:12 <syntaxfree> the less power GvR has out there, the better the world is.
22:04:12 <int-e> python is nice. 2.4 at least. some new 2.5 features look a bit scary.
22:04:20 <newsham> how is that so much worse than   def dot(f,g) : return lambda x : f(g(x)) ?
22:04:39 <int-e> newsham: aside from the fact that it's unreadable ...
22:04:44 <newsham> (err.. should be "return comp")
22:04:59 <newsham> inte: wait, are you saying that you seriously cant read that?
22:05:11 <newsham> you're a big boy...
22:05:12 <int-e> newsham: I was going to add, and you even managed to mess it up in a way that lambda wouldn't have let you.
22:05:50 <newsham> int-e: granted, but thats because of linewrap.  i use these things all th etime, I can assure you I dont get confused that easily.
22:05:51 <int-e> newsham: no, I just dislike having to think of new identifiers for things that really don't need a name.
22:06:09 <newsham> int-e: right.. I concede that is the one and only downside (and sometimes a documentary bonus)
22:06:15 <int-e> newsham: and lambda does well for that.
22:06:24 <monochrom> You can always use meaningless names.
22:06:26 <int-e> newsham: so why remove it?
22:06:31 <syntaxfree> GvR seems to think FP means "recursion instead of loops".
22:06:47 <syntaxfree> And he's cock-sure that the human brain is wired  to think in loops.
22:06:48 <newsham> int-e: *shrug* most people dont use it, and its not a full lambda anyway.
22:06:54 <sieni> GvR seems to smoke crack for breakfast.
22:06:57 <newsham> sf: you're being ridiculous.

22:08:32 <int-e> ok, he wants list comprehension for that
22:08:40 <syntaxfree> Paraphrase: GvR says Python is more productive because there's less typing to be done.

22:09:05 <int-e> actually I find the filter more readable ;)

22:09:48 <int-e> newsham: but we're running in circles.
22:09:48 <syntaxfree> Python list comprehensions are unreadable. You need to memorize the bizarre syntax.

22:11:40 <syntaxfree> there's no visual distinction.
22:11:56 <int-e> I can't say lambda is essential in python, neither is filter ... but I don't buy that it's obscure and unreadable. I'd rather see 'this adds 10% complexity to our parser and compiler' as a reason.
22:11:56 <syntaxfree> [x | x<-l, p]
22:12:06 <syntaxfree> [x for x in l if p]. Confusing!
22:12:26 <newsham> syntax: get back to me when you're arguing about semantic features and not whining about choices of characters in the syntax.
22:13:04 <int-e> but maybe I'm spoiled by Haskell which is so rich on - mostly unecessary - syntactic sugar.
22:13:05 <monochrom> I think syntax does matter.  Otherwise there wouldn't be a big fuss about choosing variable names.
22:13:19 <newsham> btw, I translated the tiny haskell sudoku solver into python:  http://www.thenewsh.com/~newsham/x/machine/sud.py     it is a bit uglier than the haskell version, but didn't have to jump through any hoops to get the semantics.

22:15:47 <lambdabot> Title: Sonic Youth - The Ineffable Me Lyrics
22:16:01 <int-e> one reason for that is, of course, that python's lambda is very restricted - it only works for expressions and most interesting language constructs are statements.
22:16:16 <syntaxfree> but it's a sideways nod to Scheme. I only got in the right track about programming with Scheme.
22:16:24 <int-e> for example lambda x: print x  isn't allowed.
22:16:52 <syntaxfree> I've been hacking up stuff on and off since I was like 8, and I never really *got* programming until an elective course taught me Scheme.
22:16:59 <newsham> dons: most of the haskell.org versions are trying to be fancy and sometimes efficient.  the 707 byte version is neither, but its small...
22:17:24 <Pseudonym> Scheme can cure you of a lot of bad programming habits.  Especially if those bad habits were obtained while using Lisp.
22:17:51 <syntaxfree> I was 8, and I had access to two programming languages.
22:17:57 <syntaxfree> ZX Spectrum BASIC, and GW-Basic.
22:18:03 * int-e couldn't believe that common lisp is so big but has no standard FFI. all the world is Lisp?
22:18:40 <Pseudonym> Actually more than one world is Lisp, if you see the size of ClTL.
22:18:41 <syntaxfree> This is 1989 I'm talking about. No internet access. No books beyond silly 1970s game listing books. For the wrong versions of Basic.
22:18:50 <Pseudonym> CLtL, rather.
22:19:01 <monochrom> I think Haskell is pretty learnable for the uninitiated.  A highschool kid, having had some math but otherwise uninitiated, would be comfortable to find that "x=x+1" causes problems, as expected.
22:19:05 <newsham> there were too many of us. We had access to too much money, too much equipment. And little by little we went insane
22:19:17 <Pseudonym> I was lucky.  I had Creative Computing and Les Bell-era APC.
22:19:34 <newsham> mono: you could teach functional programming to beginners in haskell as long as you avoided monads.
22:19:39 <syntaxfree> int-e: Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When you read about Symbolics you get the feel of all-powerfulness Lisp people had.
22:19:42 <monochrom> When you see most people having difficulties learning Haskell, it is because they are initiated, i.e., initiated the other way.
22:19:48 <syntaxfree> C was a hack, a virus. They had the right way.
22:20:17 <syntaxfree> Yeah. Scheme basically shut out all my bad habits.
22:20:32 <newsham> "two dozen short lessons" does that well.  you could take that directly and teach high school kids
22:20:37 <syntaxfree> I arrived to Haskell as a blank, purely-functional sheet.
22:21:01 <monochrom> I don't believe monads pose a problem.
22:21:01 <int-e> syntaxfree: well, it made me give up on Lisp. (I'm beginning to think that it's not really that much of a loss anymore.)
22:21:26 <newsham> heh, awesome,  so great to hear such sweeping generalizations from someone who claims to be largely ignorant of other languages, sf. :)
22:21:51 * syntaxfree is not saying C is a hack, I'm saying that the Lisp people believed C to be a hack.

22:30:44 <Pseudonym> You're wrong.
22:30:50 <Pseudonym> Perhaps not about this, but you're wrong in general.
22:31:00 <monochrom> Haskell is somewhat terse (not as much as APL).  I think it's a virtue, and it's natural to me to be somewhat terse.  I am saying this not because I favour Haskell; I already preferred somewhat terse when I knew only BASIC, Pascal, and C.
22:31:37 <monochrom> One reason I preferred C to Pascal was that it was { } vs begin end.
22:31:55 <dons> there's an important distinction difference between terse and obfuscated
22:31:59 <int-e> C has less typing and better visual clues.

22:32:42 <monochrom> But you will never think of terseness negatively again after you have seen COBOL.  "MULTIPLY X BY Y TO Z"  That was when I decided I would rather have it terse.
22:34:53 <monochrom> It is not natural for me to write like "multiply x by y to z" all day long.  I don't think it's natural to any CS student either.  You enter CS precisely because you don't what to write in English; you want to write in a better language and notation.

22:37:31 <monochrom> I'm not bashing cobol.  I'm saying, some people talk of terseness negatively, and I want to give them a reality check by pointing out what alternative you have if you remove terseness.
