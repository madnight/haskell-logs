00:00:03 <dons> or
00:00:05 <dons> ?kind Either
00:00:05 <u221e> You only need one type though, not two.
00:00:06 <lambdabot> * -> * -> *
00:00:15 <dons> ?kind []
00:00:16 <lambdabot> * -> *
00:00:28 <u221e> My list is just defined as:
00:00:47 <mwc> u221e, * -> * means you need one type, and that gives you another type.
00:00:58 <u221e> data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
00:01:09 <mwc> it's like function types: Bool -> Int means you take a bool to give an Int
00:01:10 <dons> is university back in session now in europe/
00:01:33 <mwc> u221e, and your List has kind (* -> *)
00:01:54 <mwc> u221e, is the error from your instance definition for Monad?
00:02:15 <u221e> Perhaps
00:02:55 <u221e> How should I make it an instance of the Monad class?
00:03:26 <mwc> Well, monad has kind (* -> *) I believe
00:03:37 <mwc> so I think what you'd want is: instance Monad List where
00:03:40 <RyanT5000> instance Monad List where
00:03:41 <RyanT5000> yeah
00:04:58 <mwc> u221e, I should say, instances of Monad have type (* -> *)
00:05:40 <mwc> for instance, (>>=) :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a  -> m b) -> m b, you see how m is applied to one "type argument" to give a type? That's why m has to have type * -> *.
00:10:28 <u221e> :\
00:14:55 <u221e> How is liftM any different then map?
00:18:46 <RyanT5000> well, for one, liftM works on all monads
00:19:25 <RyanT5000> however, liftM used in the list monad seems equivalent to map
00:23:24 <LordBrai1> yep
00:23:29 <LordBrai1> fmap too
00:24:10 <LordBrai1> but, you should probably use map, unlesss you are coding for monads in general or functors in general
00:24:22 <RyanT5000> yeah, it's more obvious
00:26:29 <LordBrai1> perhaps it seems strange because other langauges dont have so many levels of abstraction
00:26:35 <LordBrai1> think of math tho
00:26:50 <LordBrai1> plenty of levels there
00:36:38 <LordBrai1> especially if by math i mean category theory...
00:36:42 <LordBrai1> :D
00:46:33 <LordBrai1> kind... mwc.. i was trying to think of the word when i read your post... thats why m has kind * -> *
00:48:52 <LordBrai1> hmm i missed the beginning of your convo tho
00:49:17 <LordBrai1> anyway.. happy hacking
00:49:20 <LordBrai1> i'm off
01:41:22 * shapr boings

01:44:59 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
01:45:33 <dcoutts> @tell ndm eg see http://haskell.org/hoogle/?q=ParseError
01:45:33 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
01:47:32 <Saulzar> Hmm, I guess you can always click the API link to have a look
02:04:42 <shapr> Jun Mukai is making progress on the IMAP4 implementation.
02:06:20 * shapr bounces cheerfully
02:06:31 <dmhouse> Is that the HaskellNet guy?
02:06:37 <shapr> Yup
02:06:42 <dmhouse> Cool. :)
02:06:53 * dmhouse doesn't know what IMAP is, but it sounds good :)
02:07:06 <shapr> It's like pop3, but better.
02:07:13 <dmhouse> Oh, fun.
02:09:10 <nothingmuch> imap4 is only better for the users, not the implementors ;-)
02:09:14 <nothingmuch> horrible horrible protocol
02:09:20 <shapr> true that
02:09:52 <dmhouse> So which other teams (aside from the Lazy Bottoms) are doing the ICFP contest?
02:11:00 <shapr> I think that's a brilliant name.
02:15:25 <psnl> if you get the joke, it lovely
02:15:54 <norpan> very good name
02:16:46 <norpan> Eager Tops
02:17:03 <norpan> or Eager Weak Head Normal Forms perhaps
02:21:06 <dmhouse> norpan: ;)
02:49:49 <dmhouse> Yay, two people converted to Emacs before lunch.
03:03:52 * shapr cheerfully builds ghc6.5
03:10:01 <shapr> @yow !
03:10:01 <lambdabot> It was a JOKE!!  Get it??  I was receiving messages from DAVID
03:10:02 <lambdabot> LETTERMAN!!  YOW!!
03:10:05 <shapr> marc_vw: How's code?
03:10:59 <marc_vw> hi shapr
03:11:13 <marc_vw> i need to put meat in the repo
03:11:26 <marc_vw> should be ok today maybe tomorrow
03:12:14 <shapr> Sounds good.
03:12:49 <marc_vw> this was a damn week
03:13:08 <marc_vw> i founded my own company this week
03:13:11 <shapr> neat!
03:13:25 <marc_vw> we will do software for patents
03:13:34 <marc_vw> i hope i can use haskell/gtk for that :-)
03:14:23 <marc_vw> need to check the licenses
03:14:30 <marc_vw> ghc should be ok
03:14:37 <shapr> Should be fine.
03:14:38 <marc_vw> gtk i hope too
03:14:47 <marc_vw> dont know about the bindings
03:14:56 <marc_vw> and how good it works on windows
03:15:23 <shapr> ndm has been trying it recently.
03:15:52 <shapr> It had problems installing this week, but I think dcoutts has talked to the GTK guys about the problems.
03:16:42 <marc_vw> we need to open up part of our code base
03:16:55 <marc_vw> because we will commercialize our exam work
03:17:13 <marc_vw> so in haskell we have another barrier :-)
03:17:33 <marc_vw> it will be more effort to just rip us off
03:19:06 <marc_vw> i would have loved to do icfp contest
03:19:12 <marc_vw> but i need to work on soc
03:19:25 <marc_vw> cant take off 4 days
03:19:47 <marc_vw> cant do all at the same time
03:24:15 <roconnor> @vixen @yow!
03:24:16 <lambdabot> I consider rabits as an endangered species.
03:26:52 <roconnor> @vixen I loooooooooooooooooove bunnies!
03:26:52 <lambdabot> what's the matter?
03:36:35 <mnislaih> @seen Lemmih
03:36:36 <lambdabot> Lemmih is in #oasis, #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I last heard Lemmih speak 13 hours, 14 minutes and 41 seconds ago.
03:37:14 <mnislaih> Lemmih are you around and alive ?
03:44:28 <marc_vw> how many haskell teams will go for icfp?
03:44:38 <marc_vw> (the contest)
03:45:26 <dcoutts> several I expect
03:45:32 <dcoutts> I know of at least 3
03:45:58 <marc_vw> hi duncan
03:46:11 <marc_vw> is there a bunch that does it lightly?
03:46:29 <marc_vw> just to have a bit of fun and talk about the problem
03:46:45 <marc_vw> the one i met seemd dead serious uncool
03:47:13 <dcoutts> heh
03:47:17 <dcoutts> hmm, not sure
03:47:40 <dcoutts> I'm sure you can put either find or put together a 'pub' team from people on #haskell
03:48:46 <marc_vw> i cant devote 4 days to icfpc
03:48:49 <marc_vw> not this year
03:49:08 <marc_vw> i dont want go for first place
03:49:13 <marc_vw> but maybe nice try
03:51:45 <shapr> I think log-structured filesystems need to use Non-stop Haskell.
03:55:11 <shapr> Yow, filesystems desperately need something like monad transformers. --> http://lwn.net/Articles/190223/
03:55:13 <lambdabot> Title: LWN: The 2006 Linux Filesystems Workshop (Part II)
03:58:29 <dcoutts> so I've taked to my parents and I can offer a sofa bed for one and floor space for two
03:58:41 <dcoutts> so I offered first to xerox shapr and Lemmih
03:58:47 <shapr> Yay!
03:59:14 * _Codex is going to try icfp contest this year.
03:59:54 <dcoutts> right, I'm off to the lab to check our room and make sure all the machines are working for 5pm today :-)
04:01:19 <dcoutts> dons, I ran the benchmarks yesterday, havn' had enough time to analyse them thoroughly yet
04:01:24 <dcoutts> still some suprises
04:02:41 <shapr> dcoutts: Did you come to any conclusion for doing quick GHC builds?
04:02:46 <shapr> I think I missed that discussion...
04:03:26 <dcoutts> shapr, use in your mk/build.mk:
04:03:26 <dcoutts> SRC_HC_OPTS     = -H32m -O0 -fasm
04:03:26 <dcoutts> GhcStage1HcOpts = -O0
04:03:26 <dcoutts> GhcLibHcOpts    = -O
04:03:26 <dcoutts> GhcLibWays      =
04:03:26 <dcoutts> SplitObjs       = NO
04:03:32 <dcoutts> GhcBootLibs     = YES
04:03:47 <dcoutts> actually, -fasm is redundant there I think
04:03:48 <shapr> thanks!
04:04:06 <dcoutts> for even quicker leave off GhcLibHcOpts    = -O
04:04:19 <dcoutts> but I needed that to get the libs built with the fusion rules active I think
04:04:31 <dcoutts> and otherwise the progs you build will run really slowly
04:04:56 <dcoutts> so those settigns should build a fully functional ghc that produces full speed code
04:05:05 <dcoutts> ghc itself will be slower to run of course
04:05:17 <shapr> But it builds quickly, yeah?
04:05:22 <dcoutts> quicker
04:05:26 <dcoutts> ;-)
04:05:27 <shapr> Right :-)
04:09:21 <marc_vw> duncan is the gtk binding usable under windows?
04:17:12 <vincenz> re
04:17:24 <vincenz> @seeon dons
04:17:24 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I last heard dons speak 4 hours, 16 minutes and 14 seconds ago.
04:17:30 * vincenz snaps
04:22:31 <shapr> hiya michaelw
04:22:41 <michaelw> hi
04:23:01 <michaelw> is there an icfpcontest channel yet?
04:26:07 <vincenz> yes
04:26:09 <vincenz> #oasis
04:26:25 <shapr> If I get rid of the x char in "user:x:... " in /etc/passwd, can I login as that user with no password?
04:26:36 * shapr forgot root on one of his debian installs and had to do init=/bin/sh
04:27:37 <LordBrain> you could boot a cd and chroot...
04:27:49 <LordBrain> then run passwd
04:28:05 <LordBrain> at least i think that would work
04:30:00 <shapr> I ran chpasswd, I think that'll do it.
04:30:04 <shapr> LordBrain: thanks for the suggestion :-)
04:33:53 <dylan> just making the password empty in /etc/shadow would work too.
04:34:49 <LordBrain> if you are a sudoer.. you could run sudo passwd root
04:36:02 <LordBrain> thats the easiest probably
04:36:32 <LordBrain> or use sudo to change the file
04:36:56 <LordBrain> anyway you got it... so why are we still working
04:36:59 <LordBrain> :)
04:37:04 <Failure02> if i've opened a file with IO.openFile, how do i read n bytes?
04:37:32 <Failure02> is it lazy somehow, so i could just use take n after doing hGetContents or something?
04:37:54 <LordBrain> thats what i was going to say
04:38:37 <LordBrain> there are other ways i am sure.. but that seems simple.
04:39:06 <dylan> sudo nor passwd won't work if / or /var are mounted ro.
04:39:24 <shapr> mount -o remount,rw /
04:39:32 <shapr> Anyway, focus time. bbl
04:39:59 <Failure02> LordBrain: are you replying to me? is it lazy? because i don't want to read a whole 2 GB file if i just want 10 chars :)
04:40:11 <LordBrain> yes
04:40:27 <Failure02> okay, thanks
04:40:46 <LordBrain> well... its not a byte at a time tho
04:40:50 <LordBrain> it has a buffer size
04:40:52 <LordBrain> which you can set
04:41:31 <Failure02> okay
04:41:47 <dons> Failure02: yeah, just lazily take n from the input
04:41:54 <dons> so,
04:42:02 <dons> readFile "x" >>= return . take n
04:42:04 <dons> for exapmle
04:52:39 <wolverian> any QM specialists here? wondering if http://www.bottomlayer.com/bottom/kim-scully/kim-scully-web.htm is crack or not
04:52:40 <lambdabot> Title: Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser
04:54:21 <sieni> wolverian: I've heard of some experiment like that before
04:54:42 <sieni> Although I can't claim to be a QM specialist :-)
04:55:33 <sieni> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment
04:55:45 <sieni> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser
04:56:10 <wolverian> I asked if anyone knew the validity of the experiment. wikipedia doesn't count.. :9
04:56:13 <wolverian> s,9,),
04:57:47 <sieni> probably, since it appears to be the expected result ^_^
04:59:59 <wolverian> sieni, heh
05:01:23 <roconnor> How does a quantum eraser work?
05:01:39 <roconnor> given that QM is reversable.
05:02:38 <gaal> hello. running ghc-pkg --user list doesn't show me a package that I have in ~/.ghc/.../package.conf. strace shows that ~/.ghc isn't even consulted
05:03:15 <gaal> ah, it's "list --user"...
05:07:13 <gaal> what do I put on the ghc command line to get it to use an alternate packages.conf when searchign for user packages?
05:07:40 <dons> oh, been a while, -package-conf foo.conf ?
05:08:40 <dons> yes, -package-conf file
05:08:47 <roconnor> sieni: Why is there no interference at PS?
05:09:15 <gaal> dons: yes, thanks. but hmm, my build is still failing with missing modules.
05:09:29 <dons> are the packages installed and registered?
05:09:33 <dons> so many netsplits :/
05:09:50 <gaal> oh! I was missing a -isrc. works now, thanks again :-)
05:09:54 <dons> ah good
05:17:15 <psnl> oh oh oh epigram paper
05:20:09 <dcoutts_> psnl, where? where? where?

05:22:52 <lambdabot>  Parse error
05:22:57 <dons> oh, huh
05:23:03 <dons> fair enough, i suppose
05:23:13 <vincenz> dons: get my message?
05:24:18 <dons> i don't know what's going on?
05:24:23 <dons> do you have a recent cabal?
05:24:30 <dons> (no one else has reported problems)
05:24:39 <vincenz> the one that shipped with 6.4.1
05:24:52 <dons> try 6.4.2
05:24:57 <vincenz> oy
05:24:58 <dons> or install a new cabal
05:25:02 <vincenz> @where cabal
05:25:03 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/cabal
05:25:04 <dcoutts_> ndm, sorry can't offer floor space as I'm all booked up, ask Heffalump
05:25:19 <ndm> dcoutts_, fair enough, will ask him
05:25:20 <lambdabot> ndm: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.
05:25:28 <vincenz> it's not a good idea to rely on the very latest of libs
05:25:41 <dcoutts_> ndm, oh those messages were about hoogle
05:25:46 <dons> vincenz: 6.4.2 is the latest stable :)
05:25:56 <dons> its not like we're relying on 6.5 ;)
05:26:07 <ndm> dcoutts_, yeah, i was thinking the same thing when i saw those results
05:26:52 <vincenz> dons: 6.4.2 doesn't ship with all distros
05:27:25 <dons> vincenz: ok ok. if you can make the lambdabot .cabal file compile with 6.4.1, i'll accept patches..
05:27:43 <vincenz> ok
05:27:48 <ndm> dons, any idea about my sh problem>
05:27:55 <dcoutts_> vincenz, it ships with all decent distros :)
05:28:16 <dcoutts_> but then we can't all run gentoo
05:28:18 * dcoutts_ runs
05:28:24 <vincenz> dcoutts_: ubuntu -just- came out with dapper
05:28:28 <vincenz> it ships 6.4.1.
05:28:37 <dcoutts_> that's debian's fault for being slow
05:28:45 <vincenz> ghc-6.4.1: ghc-6.4.1: panic! (the `impossible' happened, GHC version 6.4.1): unknown exception
05:28:58 <vincenz> right after Building lambdabot-4.0...
05:28:58 <dcoutts_> yeah, that's one of my favourites
05:29:03 <dcoutts_> it's a package problem
05:29:07 <dons> yeah, its a classic, really
05:29:17 <dcoutts_> the error message is fixed in 6.4.2 so you at least know what's wrong
05:29:21 <dons> its solved if you use 6.4.2 ..
05:29:24 <dons> ah, as dcoutts_ says
05:29:27 <vincenz> no
05:29:35 <vincenz> dcoutts_ said that the error message is solved, not the error
05:29:39 * vincenz poks dons 
05:29:46 <dcoutts_> the error is something different
05:29:52 <dcoutts_> usually in your own setup
05:29:52 * dons gets sleep, then icfp for 3 days.
05:29:53 <dcoutts_> iirc
05:30:01 <vincenz> dons: ah participating too :0
05:30:03 <vincenz> :)
05:30:06 <vincenz> dons: ok
05:30:08 <vincenz> dcoutts_: ok
05:30:11 <vincenz> I might have a hunch
05:30:34 <vincenz> nope, that's not it
05:31:01 <Failure02> is there a standard function equivalent to (filter p list, filter (not . p) list)?
05:31:03 <gaal> is there a way of tracing programs with ghc (other than Debug.Trace)? I'm trying to find the cause of a loop...
05:31:15 <psnl> hat
05:31:34 <dons> Failure02: partition
05:31:34 <gaal> psnl: I think I'm using ghc extensions hat might barf on
05:31:38 <Failure02> thanks
05:31:53 <dons> > partition (> 3) [1..7]
05:31:54 <lambdabot>  ([4,5,6,7],[1,2,3])
05:31:55 <ndm> gaal: it barfs on pretty much most things :(
05:32:03 <gaal> hey ndm! :)
05:32:15 <ndm> hey gaal
05:33:16 <psnl> gaal: lifing things into the IO monad?
05:33:59 <gaal> psnl: no, just using DrIFT to pretty-print Hs data as something else.
05:34:28 <ndm> gaal: you might get some luck with profiling
05:34:36 <ndm> leave it to run a while, say 10 seconds
05:34:46 <ndm> and then hopefully most of the time will be spent in the non-terminating cmoputation
05:35:08 <gaal> so, that's ghc -prof ?
05:35:19 <gaal> never used it beofre. where does the data go?
05:35:24 <dblhelix> gaal: ghc -prof -auto-all
05:35:36 <ndm> no idea, look up GHC profiling, ghc -prof -auto-all,then +RTS -p when you run, or something
05:35:43 <dblhelix> gaal: and then run with ./myexec +RTS -p -RTS
05:36:29 <gaal> eek! it looks like when I use -prof on the ghc invocation, ghc no longer honors -package :-)
05:36:33 <gaal> s/)/(/
05:37:54 <gaal> that's pretty sad. I hope I don't have to resort to copying over my packages.conf to ~/.ghc ...
05:38:40 <gaal> ah, no, apparently it does honor it, but the libararies must themselves be compield with profiling?
05:38:50 <ndm> gaal: yes, they must be
05:39:00 <ndm> gaal: most libraries have both versions
05:39:08 <ndm> and cabal will install both with the right prodding
05:39:38 <gaal> ndm: well, one is fps and I'm the coauthor of the other one, so I guess I can get that to work :)
05:42:35 <gaal> how to I pass extra ghc opts to ./Setup build ?
05:43:25 <gaal> ah, I want --enable-library-profiling it seems.
05:46:35 <gaal> uh, oh, fps when built with profiling dies with "Could not find module `GHC.IOBase'".   Anyone know if on debian I can get profiling libraries of ghc without buildgin my own ghc?
05:47:15 <gaal> yay, apt-get install ghc6-prof
05:59:10 <gaal> okay, another question: how do I ask Setup.hs to pass along a -package / -f switch along and use an alternate packages.conf?
05:59:50 <Lemmih> Why would you do that?
06:02:37 <musasabi> Alive for a change.
06:03:53 <gaal> Lemmih: I don't want to expose my intermediate dependencies
06:05:05 <SamB> huh?
06:06:26 <gaal> pugs has a few prereqs it builds and registers them in a private pacakges.conf
06:06:43 <Lemmih> musasabi: Hey!
06:07:05 <gaal> I just want profiling versions of the same, likewise w/o polluting ~/.ghc/*/packages.conf
06:07:51 <Lemmih> musasabi: We've been worried.
06:08:24 <Lemmih> gaal: Profiling versions of libraries wont show up in the package.conf file.
06:09:14 <SamB> gaal: so why don't you figure out how to get pugs to build them with profiling for you?
06:09:46 <gaal> SamB: it's a maze of twisty build scripts, all alike
06:09:56 <SamB> gaal: if they are all alike, you can use sed
06:10:06 <SamB> if they are all different, just edit the relevant one
06:10:26 <musasabi> Lemmih: sorry. I am now better and will be coming back slowly.
06:10:37 <SamB> oh, also, in the all alike case they should be refactored
06:12:35 <gaal> certainly. commits welcome :) I was just out for a debugging session.
06:14:34 <Lemmih> musasabi: Glad to hear you're getting better.
06:16:34 <vincenz> musasabi: hi
06:16:41 <vincenz> musasabi: glad to hear you're getting better as well
06:17:22 <SamB> what was wrong with him?
06:17:40 <gaal> luckily, the 'make profiled' target appears to be working.
06:18:12 <JohnMeacham> musasabi: ah. think I found part of the issue.
06:19:28 <dcoutts_> Lemmih, so there's space for you at my place on the 4th & 5th, I've ok'ed it with my parents.
06:19:55 <vincenz> doh, I need to find place as well
06:20:10 <dcoutts_> we can arrange transport details nearer to the time, now's the time for ICFP :-)
06:20:19 <dcoutts_> @yarr!
06:20:20 <lambdabot> Smartly me lass
06:20:26 <vincenz> dcoutts_: #oasis has become a generic icfpc channel
06:20:32 <vincenz> dcoutts_: we have a separate one for team stuff
06:20:39 <dcoutts_> ok
06:22:09 <musasabi> First day of touching Haskell in ages, it feels very nice :-)
06:22:49 <norpan> haskell is always nice to touch
06:23:05 <norpan> much more so than the ugly beast that is c++ that i'm currently touching
06:25:22 <vincenz> yeah, haskell's like touching a 25 year old model compared to the 50 year old, fat hairy male that is c++
06:25:40 * vincenz coughs
06:25:40 <neologism> vincenz: hehe
06:26:06 <norpan> model and male are not quite separate
06:26:39 <vincenz> +female
06:26:54 <norpan> 25 year old is too old
06:27:00 <norpan> 20 is better
06:27:03 <vincenz> 25 is perfect
06:27:08 <psnl> about right for haskell....
06:31:14 <ndm> psnl: i talked to malcolm at lunch today, he was suprised to hear that there was anyone external with such an interest in hat
06:31:54 <lightstep> anyone already fgured the file format?
06:32:00 <psnl> malcolm wallace?
06:32:22 <norpan> malcolm x
06:32:31 <psnl> why the suprise?
06:32:49 <vincenz> lightstep: get to #oasis, it's discussion channel for icfpc
06:33:08 <ndm> psnl: yep, malcolm wallace
06:33:25 <ndm> he just didn't realise there was anyone else around doing stuff on it - it doesn't get much love from external people
06:34:00 <psnl> I haven't started doing anything yet, just doing a lot of thinking
06:34:55 * psnl wonders why noy
06:34:58 <psnl> not, even
06:35:26 <ndm> because it doesn't really work on many programs
06:35:31 <ndm> because the library support is not there
06:35:39 <ndm> and because the tools are deeply confusing to use
06:35:45 <ndm> a GUI solves the last one
06:35:48 <psnl> yeah
06:35:53 <ndm> using the base libraries solves the second
06:36:10 <ndm> then i reckon user numbers would grow substantially, esp if it was integrated into an environment
06:36:15 <ndm> which it will be, with winhaskell
06:36:22 * psnl nods
06:36:44 <psnl> I'm coming at it from a making it easier to use to help beginners out
06:37:37 <psnl> since watching people find problems in their haskell assignments last christmas was painful
06:38:24 <ndm> yep, me too, beacuse at the moment its too hard for me to use
06:38:45 <ndm> despite being able to throw stones at most of the people who did it while sitting at my desk
06:42:16 <norpan> ndm: hey, where were that gui stuff you talked 'bout
06:42:24 <ndm> @where hat-gui
06:42:25 <lambdabot> http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/projects/hat.php
06:42:37 <ndm> norpan: its in teh hat repo too
06:42:45 <norpan> no, not that, the "bindings"
06:43:08 <ndm> @where proplang
06:43:09 <lambdabot> http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/darcs/proplang
06:43:16 <norpan> ah, thanks
06:43:31 <ndm> norpan: if you have any thoughts on what i should do with this, please let me know :)
06:43:34 <norpan> with all the nice symbols
06:43:36 <ndm> i'm not sure what to do with it now
06:44:03 <norpan> i'll have to understand it first :)
06:44:18 <ndm> norpan: feel free to ask any questions, i'd like some more input
06:44:32 <ndm> although the event/variable stuff is reasonably complex
06:44:45 <ndm> you should be able to figure it out just using that as an abstraction
06:54:05 <norpan> hmmm
06:54:27 <norpan> you're using ! for onClicked as well
06:55:18 <norpan> i see
06:55:51 <ndm> norpan: i'm using object!property as the syntax
06:55:55 <norpan> yeah
06:56:00 <ndm> you can also do variable += event
06:56:06 <ndm> or txt!text += handler
06:56:18 <ndm> i.e. register a handler for when the text of txt changes
06:56:48 <ndm> you can thing of variables being events as well
06:56:53 <norpan> because a variable is an Eventer
06:57:25 <ndm> yep
06:57:37 <ndm> but an eventer is just something with an event in
06:57:37 <norpan> which emits an event when changed
06:57:45 <ndm> a superclass, in OO languages
06:57:47 <ndm> yep
06:57:54 <norpan> or whatever your terminology is
06:58:10 <ndm> yeah, terminology is still being worked on :)
06:58:44 <ndm> eventually there will be read only variables as well
06:58:58 <ndm> but i didn't have a need for them yet
07:01:13 <norpan> hmmm, it seems interesting, but not quite obvious
07:01:34 <ndm> norpan: not quite obvious in which way?
07:01:43 <ndm> how you would structure a program with these building blocks
07:01:48 <norpan> yes
07:01:48 <ndm> or something else?
07:02:14 <ndm> to me, its obvious how to do it, but thats because i came up with the idea and it matches how i think
07:02:26 <ndm> as for other people, only other people can figure that out
07:02:39 <norpan> also, how to extend to more complicated widgets
07:02:42 <ndm> in general, i think about what the important variables are
07:02:53 <ndm> and then think of their relationships
07:03:00 <ndm> norpan: no, it won't as it stands
07:03:26 <ndm> there are two options - just don't, use the properties and events model where it makes sense, provide the existing gtk interface for the bits that don't
07:03:35 <ndm> or use property delta's
07:03:46 <ndm> so you express a property based on what has changed, or what needs to change
07:04:26 <ndm> i think it will be useful just to make gtk more abstract
07:04:32 <norpan> yes
07:04:36 <norpan> undoubtedly
07:04:53 <ndm> then the documentation is a list of properties and what they mean, a list of widgets, and a list of what widgets have which property
07:05:59 <norpan> i remember liking the fudgets interface, but making anything useful with it was a pain :)
07:06:29 <ndm> i haven't played with fudgets
07:06:56 <ndm> but because my approach is on top of gtk, its easy enough to not use it if you don't want to
07:07:04 <norpan> yeah
08:14:33 <vincenz> For all icfpc-lovers, -competitors, -dilettantes, -curious, there's a channel and it's very #haskell'oriented
08:16:09 <yip> what's the channel?
08:17:44 <vincenz> #oasis
08:26:10 <sylvan> Quick Q about -threaded, in the wikie it says "You should use a -N value equal to the number of CPU cores on your machine (not including Hyper-threading cores).", how come I should exclude hyper threading? I mean I'm not expecting a 2x increase ni performance using HT obviously, but wouldn't it be beneficial to at least use them a bit?
08:28:35 <SamB> well, you could benchmark it if you like...
08:29:43 <sylvan> Yeah I was just wondering if there was some reason for explicitly telling people not to include HT... (i.e. it is an error to do so, rather than it just might not produce as much of a speed increase as you'd like)
08:30:38 <sylvan> I haven't managed to get GHC 6.5 to compile on windows yet, and I recently managed to mess up my linux partition (damn that Vista!) so I can't benchmark it...
08:34:20 <mux> sylvan: yes, there is a security issue with HT
08:35:13 <mux> that's quite a good reason not to use it :-)
08:35:15 <mux> http://www.daemonology.net/hyperthreading-considered-harmful/
08:35:16 <lambdabot> Title: Hyper-Threading considered harmful
08:36:31 <sylvan> Hmm.. But that has nothing to do with GHC does it? I mean if I have, say a dual core HT machine and run a GHC app with N2 then some of the times a single core will run both threads using HT right?
08:37:08 <mux> nah, it clearly has nothing to do with GHC
08:37:47 <mux> it seems HT is a pessimization in most cases, except in multi-threaded applications using the FPU a lot
08:38:42 <sylvan> okay, so the advice on not including HT is not due to this security issue, but something else then? Or should it be reformulated as "note that including HT 'cores' may not produce the expected additional performance" or something?
08:42:27 <mux> I would personally formulate it as "HT sucks big time"
08:42:34 <mux> but feel free to express it another way :-)
08:46:44 <lampe> hmm.. is there a smart way to find the smallest element of a tree? all i can think of is put all the elements in a list and map min over it?
08:48:57 <vincenz> lampe: defifne "tree"
08:49:04 <vincenz> define evne
08:49:30 <sjanssen> lampe: there is Data.List.minimum
08:50:39 <lampe> it's Data OctTree = Leaf Voxel [Object] | Node Voxel [OctTree]
08:51:06 <sjanssen> you want to find the minimum Voxel, or Object?
08:51:13 <lampe> data Voxel = (Point, Int) where Int is the size which i want to find the minimum of
08:55:32 <Lemmih> minTree (Leaf (_,i) []) = i; minTree (Node (_,i) ts) = minimum (t:map minTree ts) ?

10:33:50 <vincenz> anyone got a place I can crash?
10:42:33 <greenrd> vincenz: there are two offers listed on the wiki page
10:44:13 <Philippa> it might be worth putting a request for space up on the page as well as asking around
10:49:14 <vincenz> good idea
11:29:07 <ptolomy> Does it no longer make sense to have a debian ghc-cvs package?
12:03:29 <sjanssen> I'm guessing the ICFP team named "Lazy Bottoms" is a Haskell team, do they hang out here?
12:03:53 <davidad> they have their own channel
12:04:06 <sjanssen> yeah, I'm just curious who is in the team
12:04:08 <davidad> i think it's vincenz, jethr0, adept, and someone else
12:04:33 <davidad> http://www.notvincenz.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Icfp/Team
12:04:35 <lambdabot> Title: Not Vincenz's Wiki | Icfp / Team
12:04:37 <sjanssen> I see.  According to the scoreboard they're winning
12:04:59 <davidad> heh
12:05:06 <davidad> I haven't even written any code yet
12:05:32 <marc_vw> you will in 30-60minutes, i guess
12:05:44 <marc_vw> once the skeleton is there it is easy
12:05:52 <davidad> should be, yes
12:07:04 <davidad> seems like it would be quite hard for someone to get ahead in this scoreboard
12:07:11 <davidad> once you are set up running the program,
12:07:19 <davidad> you just keep generating answers...?
12:07:24 <marc_vw> i think so
12:07:27 <marc_vw> we dont now yet
12:07:32 <davidad> very true :D
12:07:43 <marc_vw> 6 folks have a um or
12:07:46 <marc_vw> or wait
12:07:50 <marc_vw> we are stupid
12:07:55 <marc_vw> we should register
12:07:56 <davidad> eh?
12:07:58 <davidad> oh
12:08:00 <davidad> yeah
12:08:01 <davidad> :D
12:08:15 <davidad> i was just figuring we would go with pining for the fjords
12:08:20 <davidad> since I already have an encryption key
12:11:27 <marc_vw> nah
12:11:30 <marc_vw> or?
12:11:36 <marc_vw> what do you think?
12:12:16 <marc_vw> l
12:22:03 <monochrom> I wonder if the fastest way is to build the hardware :)
12:23:06 <monochrom> Some FPGA may do.
12:42:42 <Ulfalizer> what does the  data Foo = Bar !Type1 !Type2  syntax mean?
12:42:49 <Ulfalizer> the !Type part that is
12:44:42 <lightstep> monochrom, they say that the codex takes ~100 seconds to run
12:45:37 <davidad> lightstep: in what? C? Ruby? something in between?
12:45:54 <astrolabe> The ! means strictness I think (ie, the field is evaluated immediately)
12:48:03 <LordBrain> i've never done ruby.. is it as concise as haskell?
12:48:04 <ulfdoz> dunno the actual implementation, but from my knowledge, strictness only requires a function to return _|_ if any of there arguments does.
12:48:22 <LordBrain> i noticed it won the gzipped bytes contest in the shootout
12:48:24 <ulfdoz> s/there/its/.
12:48:31 <davidad> LordBrain: depends on how you measure and what task you're doing, but yeah, it is in generally slightly more concise
12:48:48 <LordBrain> hmm
12:48:56 <davidad> LordBrain: it's also heavily dynamic and object-based, which is what distinguished it from Haskell
12:49:10 <davidad> and it's Really Slow
12:49:23 <davidad> so it's good for rapid prototyping but not implementation of complex algorithms
12:49:24 <dylan> Really Slow doesn't even begin to describe it.
12:49:29 <davidad> yes
12:49:36 <davidad> perhaps one could say instead REALLY SLOW
12:49:39 <monochrom> "strict" is certainly of very coarse grain when it comes to aggregate data structures.
12:49:40 <jer> depends on the task
12:49:59 <LordBrain> well i wouldnt expect it to be as fast as ghc
12:50:01 <dylan> (incidently, it has a really broken UNIX/POSIX API in some places... e.g. handling SIGCHLD is unreliable.)
12:50:04 <jer> most rubyists will rebut those kinds of remarks with "we use it for things that its fast enough for"
12:50:06 <LordBrain> hugs is a more fair comparison
12:50:09 <LordBrain> i suppose
12:50:18 <davidad> yeah, i'm not sure how it compares with hugs
12:50:39 <davidad> jer: that's exactly right.  i use ruby for lots of stuff that's rate-limited by I/O. but pretty much nothing that's not
12:51:23 <dylan> code blocks that != lambdas are a bit confusing.
12:52:29 <jer> dylan, out of curiosity, could you clarify that last statement? or are you confusing ruby with python?
12:52:29 <dylan> They seemed to have fixed the "sending kill signal -1 to a ruby process doesn't make it die" bug, at least. But SIGCHLD isn't handled right still...
12:52:45 <dylan> jer: code blocks are not lambdas, but a weird syntax thing.
12:53:02 <jer> ...
12:53:13 <dylan> you need to use the lambda or proc method of Object to create a real functional value
12:53:28 <davidad> dylan, jer: code blocks are lambdas if you apply 'proc' to them
12:53:36 <jer> davidad, i know
12:53:42 <jer> which is why i was curious what dylan meant
12:53:50 <davidad> i guess that you can form a block
12:53:54 <davidad> and pass it to a function
12:53:58 <davidad> without making it really a lambda
12:54:07 <dylan> yes, with yield.
12:54:10 <davidad> right
12:54:27 <dylan> def foo x; yield x; end
12:54:29 <dylan> etc.
12:54:51 <dylan> I just would feel better if blocks where first-class without proc or lambda. (proc is sort of deprecated, btw)
12:55:38 <jer> dylan, with ruby 2 yes, not deprecated yet
12:55:48 <dylan> Even if the implementation of lambda is just: def lambda &code; code; end
12:57:35 <dylan> it's just ... funny, that block passing is a seperate part of a method call, seperate from argument passing...
12:58:17 <dylan> I suppose it's a better compromise than python's lambda.
12:58:19 <jer> ruby's syntax is highly complex. how would you handle block activation when parens are optional if blocks are first class? (out of cuirosity)
12:58:38 <jer> i don't see a way you can in ruby without changing the syntax in other places (but perhaps i'm missing something glaring)
12:59:06 <dylan> well, you'd need an extra comma
12:59:16 <dylan> if it wasn't the only argument.
12:59:27 <dylan> foo blaa, do ... end
12:59:54 <davidad> another, less dangerous possibility to solving the 'problem' if it can be called that,
12:59:55 <jer> huh? sorry, that didn't make much sense, can you clarify?
13:00:12 <davidad> would be to not allow passing blocks as 'special' arguments
13:00:15 <davidad> and require a lambda
13:00:16 <davidad> however
13:00:20 <davidad> that would make ruby look like scheme
13:00:27 <jer> dylan, my question was how to solve block activation if blocks were first class citizens without changing the ruby syntax in toher ways =]
13:00:54 <dylan> Ah. You mean using yield rather than the last-argument-& thing?
13:01:05 <Failure02> dylan: what's python's compromise with lambda?
13:01:21 <dylan> Failure02: That it contain only expressions.
13:01:24 <monochrom> Eh, when I paste on paste.lisp.org, there is no longer an automatic announcement here?
13:01:38 <Failure02> okay
13:02:07 <monochrom> http://paste.lisp.org/display/22968    This is for Ulfalizer and possibly also ulfdoz and anyone interested in ! fields in data types.
13:02:23 <dylan> to clarify the ruby thing: making "do ... end" an expression would be interesting, but probably not possible without, as davidad says, making ruby look like scheme.
13:02:25 <monochrom> Eh, and no title announcements on urls?
13:02:29 <xerox> monochrom: it depends on how you do paste to lisp.org, precisely, if you do that via new/haskell, it will automatically BEEP us, if not, you have to check the option.  Also lisppaste is required to be here to actually speak :)
13:02:44 <monochrom> This channel is boring!  No bot activities!
13:02:47 <jer> dylan, right
13:03:17 <monochrom> I always do it via new/haskell
13:03:27 <dylan> using 'yield' when the block is just an argument is obviously not possible.
13:03:42 <xerox> You can do "Bar _ n = ..." at top-level ?
13:03:58 <monochrom> In both SML and Haskell and all high level languages.
13:04:17 <xerox> Sweet.!
13:04:18 * jer much prefers the way io handles code blocks.. does away with the need for passing higher order functions in by manipulating the message tree (serves the same purpose, only works on expressions (though io is entirely an expression language), and it's about 20x faster than block activation)
13:04:48 <dylan> io is very cool.
13:05:37 <monochrom> If you can't do it in C++, then C++ is not a high level language!
13:05:39 <davidad> dylan: io is SLOWER than ruby
13:05:55 <jer> though blocks are higher order in io if you do want to use them, they work basically the same way as in functional languages
13:05:57 <LordBrain> hmm, i'm not sure what you are talking about, my pastes to lisp.pastebin.org get announced by lamdabot
13:05:59 <dylan> davidad: it's still cool.
13:06:23 <davidad> dylan: fair enough
13:06:32 <dylan> davidad: ruby is still cool, too. As long as you don't want fork and SIGCHLD working
13:06:39 <Failure02> here's a thing i've been wondering: why the hell can you write 1=0 at top-level in haskell?  it doesn't redefine any of the values either, so why is it even allowed?
13:06:39 <LordBrain> or is it paste.lisp.org
13:07:15 <Failure02> > let 1=0 in (1,0)
13:07:16 <lambdabot>  (1,0)
13:07:25 <davidad> > 1=0
13:07:26 <lambdabot>  Parse error
13:07:43 <davidad> looks like you can only do that in an inner def
13:07:50 <davidad> > let (1,0)=(0,1) in (1,0)
13:07:51 <lambdabot>  (1,0)
13:07:53 <davidad> hmm
13:07:55 <davidad> that is odd
13:08:14 <LordBrain> yeah
13:08:17 <dylan> lambdabot doesn't take top-level definitions, does it?
13:08:22 <Failure02> is it ghc?
13:08:26 <Failure02> > let 1=0
13:08:27 <lambdabot>  Parse error
13:08:41 <Failure02> i guess not. ghci allowed that.
13:08:53 <jer> davidad, io is faster than ruby when it comes to  concurency in my experience; and in objects who don't have a lot of slots, much quicker on slot access (which can be a big help in tight loops). io is also largely written in itself ,so naturally other aspects are going to be slower =]
13:09:05 <jer> anyway =]
13:09:12 <shapr> Is io fast in io?
13:09:33 <monochrom> 1=0 is allowed because it is harmless.
13:09:34 <jer> shapr, not particularly
13:09:47 <shapr> Too bad, that would be eponymous humor.
13:10:03 <LordBrain> harmless?
13:10:14 <Failure02> what kind of a justification is that?
13:10:14 <dylan> too bad io isn't statically typed.
13:10:20 <monochrom> Correction.  1=0 is allowed because it is harmless and it is a specialization of a sensible general case.
13:10:30 <jer> dylan, lol.. nah, that would kill a lot of io's flexibility
13:10:30 <shapr> hej Failure02, är du svensk?
13:10:33 <astrolabe> a contradiction like that could destroy the whole universe
13:10:33 <Failure02> japp
13:10:42 <shapr> Kanske i Stockholm? :-)
13:10:46 <Failure02> japp
13:10:48 <shapr> whoa!
13:10:52 <LordBrain> how about 1=7?
13:10:55 <monochrom> You're reading too much into "=".
13:11:08 <shapr> I'm looking for people to come to a regular Haskell, functional programming, and type theory get together in Stockholm.
13:11:29 <Philippa> get me a passport, pay transport and sure...
13:11:31 <shapr> I just got a new apartment a few hours ago! Yay! I'm moving to Hasselby.
13:11:44 <jer> unfortunately, debugging io is a bitch
13:11:53 <Failure02> interesting.
13:11:58 <shapr> I'll have actual workspace again, no more coding from the floor in one corner of my gf's room.
13:11:59 <sm> jer: agreed
13:12:02 <norpan> hÃ¤sselby?
13:12:02 <davidad> shapr: yeah, pay for me to go to Stockholm and I'd be more than happy to :D
13:12:13 <Failure02> i wouldn't be able to contribute though... i'm mostly a newbie
13:12:14 <shapr> davidad: :-P
13:12:24 <shapr> Failure02: All levels would be welcome. Interest is the only requirement :-)
13:12:44 <shapr> Failure02: Do you know any other Stockholmers that might show up?
13:12:56 <shapr> I think I'll email Karl Filip-Faxen at KTH.
13:13:20 <shapr> I wonder if Gbg people would show up if it's on Saturday?
13:13:27 <Failure02> i don't know
13:13:47 <shapr> bringert: Is there already enough FP meetings in Gbg that people wouldn't want to come to Sthlm monthly?
13:14:09 <shapr> Failure02: Are you in school, or learning Haskell for a job?
13:14:17 <shapr> Maybe just for the excitement?
13:14:23 * shapr is excited!
13:14:26 <norpan> haskell is porn
13:14:33 <shapr> It is?
13:14:39 <Failure02> i'm a student on kth
13:14:48 <shapr> Failure02: Oh cool, I was unicycling at KTH last weekend.
13:15:03 <shapr> They have nice mountain cycle trails there.
13:15:09 <shapr> I swam in the lake too!
13:15:27 <norpan> pure unadultered porn
13:15:28 <Failure02> there's a lake? :)
13:15:36 <shapr> Failure02: You should get out more ;-)
13:15:48 <Failure02> it's too hot :(
13:16:05 <shapr> I'm from Alabama. There, the streets melt in the summer.
13:16:13 <Failure02> maybe in winter, when the lake is frozen.
13:16:20 <shapr> You should move to Boden.
13:16:33 <shapr> Anyway, time to watch a movie with my woman.
13:16:34 * shapr &
13:16:47 <Failure02> aight
13:16:54 <norpan> fett
13:17:00 * dylan notes it is 33-34C here.
13:17:25 <dylan> well, outside.
13:17:33 <norpan> not here
13:17:38 <norpan> but the sun is down
13:17:40 <Ulfalizer> 33C.. that's probably around the heat record for this region :/
13:17:49 <Failure02> it's about 25 C here
13:17:54 <Failure02> but it's evening
13:18:05 <dylan> it's rather high for here, I'm close to the ocean.
13:18:09 <Ulfalizer> 18C here
13:18:12 <Ulfalizer> (söderhamn)
13:18:24 <norpan> who is _not_ in sweden
13:18:31 <dylan> 18C is a cold winter's day, for me.
13:18:37 <dylan> I'm not! :)
13:18:50 <Failure02> if it's 18 C and windy, it's okay.
13:18:58 <Ulfalizer> let's surround dylan and do nasty things to him :|
13:19:21 <dylan> Aah! vikings! No!
13:19:26 <edwinb> 18C is a lovely summer day :)
13:19:28 <norpan> garrrrr
13:19:32 <Ulfalizer> Failure02: 25 C > -10 C
13:19:34 <norpan> or is that pirates
13:19:51 * Ulfalizer is not too fond of swedish climate
13:19:56 <norpan> what do the vikings say?
13:20:10 <dylan> Vikings terrorized my irish ancestors.... and intermarried with them. But anyway
13:20:11 <Ulfalizer> norpan: bwahr?
13:20:23 <Failure02> i don't agree. if it's cold you can just wear more clothes, move a little or simply stay inside. if it's too warm all you can do is sit and melt
13:20:42 <dylan> if it's too hot, I can go jump in a spring or stay inside. :)
13:21:27 <Failure02> quiet you! ;)
13:21:37 <monochrom> I agree with Failure02
13:21:47 <norpan> yeah
13:21:49 <norpan> it's too hot
13:21:52 <norpan> 20C is perfect
13:22:22 <dylan> I find it is amazing that people from different regions have entirely different ideas about the ideal temperature.
13:22:45 <LordBrain> if you live in antartica for a while your metabolism increases
13:23:10 <Ulfalizer> Failure02: yeah, but occasionally it's nice to not be depressed from acute vitamin d deficiency :P
13:23:15 <dylan> my ideal would be about 22C.
13:23:20 <Failure02> people in the same region have different ideas too. :) a lot of swedes whine about the cold weather
13:23:26 <LordBrain> probably the same thing happens from region to region, your metabolism settles into a speed adjusted for the temperature
13:23:27 <dylan> 22.7C, say.
13:23:50 <Failure02> depression is a great swedish tradition!
13:23:56 <norpan> if above 20, then you will start sweating at the least excercise
13:24:00 <LordBrain> which means, theoretically, probably, people on the equator should be able to live longer on average..
13:24:05 <Dino_> dylan: Isn't that the truth. I like 25C - 38C
13:24:16 <dylan> norpan: Not me. It varies, when some sweats.
13:24:23 <dylan> *when someone sweats
13:24:28 <Ulfalizer> LordBrain: i don't feel very well-adjusted. i'll probably move to some warmer country.
13:24:30 <Adamant> I thought that was a Finnish tradition
13:24:40 <Adamant> depression and all
13:24:46 <Ulfalizer> swedish summer is perfect, but all too short
13:24:47 <dylan> Australian Aboriginals hardly sweat at all.
13:25:05 <dylan> Dino_: where are you from?
13:25:12 <norpan> dylan: then how do they cool down?
13:25:20 <Dino_> dylan: I currently live in North Carolina, US
13:25:27 <LordBrain> Ulfalizer: well, your metabolism will never get fast enough to keep you warm in the snow unbundled in the south pole... it guess it just goes part of the way
13:25:37 <Dino_> Originally from the kinda-too-cold New England, US
13:25:52 <dylan> norpan: well, I should say, they sweat at higher temperatures than most -- I forget what exactly.
13:26:06 <LordBrain> Ulfalizer: interestingly, animals which have evolved to thrive in such climates make exactly the opposite adjustment, their metabolisms are slower.
13:26:40 <LordBrain> i am not sure scientists understand why that is yet..
13:26:59 <dylan> I only start to sweat at about 28C.
13:27:30 <Philippa> my guess'd be slower metabolism = doesn't need to maintain so high a body temperature
13:27:33 <sm> comfortable temperature depends also on your personal consitution/health/diet/lifestyle
13:27:58 <LordBrain> hmm i didnt know that sm
13:28:09 <dylan> My body temperature is also 1 degree cooler than normal.
13:28:14 <LordBrain> so like if i eat to much sugar it makes me uncomfortable?
13:28:15 <sm> indian and chinese medicine pay a lot of attention to heat
13:28:24 <sm> LordBrain: quite possibly
13:29:19 <LordBrain> if your body temperature is 1 degree lower than usual, then i would suspect you have a slower metabolism than usual
13:29:20 <dylan> sm: and eating a stick of butter in very cold places might make one warm (or sick)?
13:29:39 <LordBrain> which isnt bad really... it is one method for prolonging lifespan
13:30:01 <dylan> One degree Fahrenheit, mind you.
13:30:01 <LordBrain> tho you might have a greater tendency to get fat which would undo that.
13:30:05 <sm> dylan: dunno.. I'd have guessed butter to be generally cooling :)
13:30:30 <sm> I know if I eat a lot of meat, spices, heavy food I'll generate more heat
13:30:47 <dylan> sm: I've heard sabout scientists stationed in antarctica eating butter to stay warm.
13:30:53 <sm> interesting
13:31:10 <Dino_> Perhaps it's the high amount of fat.
13:31:15 <Dino_> In the butter.
13:32:34 <LordBrain> one way to slow your metabolism is to eat hardly anything
13:32:53 <LordBrain> i guess the key tho would be to make sure what you do eat is jam-packed with nutrients
13:33:25 <LordBrain> then you could live like 20% longer
13:33:31 <LordBrain> than normal
13:34:05 <Ulfalizer> it's not so much the cold weather as the fact that you tend to stay inside and not get much sun during the winter. i generally feel a lot better if i get at least an hour of sun every day.
13:34:25 <Ulfalizer> i bought a laptop just to be able to sit outside
13:34:33 <LordBrain> yeah
13:34:47 <dylan> sunlight good.
13:34:59 <Ulfalizer> i wonder if you could use uv lights during the winter in some safe manner :)
13:35:03 <dylan> (says the very pale person)
13:35:28 <LordBrain> i think there are various chemical polutants coming out of the computer somehow too.. various things giving off vapors
13:35:35 <dylan> Ulfalizer: I've replaced normal light bulbs with "grow lights" before. They feel nicer.
13:35:47 <Ulfalizer> i guess that's way humans in regions with less sun exposure evolved pale skin in the first place
13:36:06 <Ulfalizer> dylan: they're UV?
13:36:17 <dylan> Ulfalizer: yes. I used to grow a lawn in my room.
13:36:27 <Ulfalizer> :P
13:36:31 <LordBrain> hahahahaha
13:36:34 <dylan> Seriously.
13:36:37 <LordBrain> on the floor?
13:36:42 <dylan> in a box on the floor.
13:36:47 <monochrom> on the ceiling!
13:36:52 <LordBrain> like instead of a carpet?
13:37:00 <LordBrain> and you'd have to mow it?
13:37:03 <dylan> LordBrain: sort of. it was just in a box though
13:37:09 <dylan> LordBrain: scissors.
13:37:13 <LordBrain> well.. ok, thats easier
13:37:17 <dylan> trimming it was very relaxing.
13:37:23 <LordBrain> hahahahaha
13:37:29 <LordBrain> was that the point?
13:37:35 <dylan> Yes.
13:37:36 <monochrom> "Come over to Anglohaskell this Friday!"  "Sorry I can't.  I have to mow my bedroom."
13:37:38 <dylan> I have a real lawn anyway.
13:37:42 <Dino_> Hey, I like that with the bonsai lawn and all. Cool idea.
13:37:50 <dylan> but the indoor lawn-in-a-box was relaxing to care for.
13:38:10 <dylan> best of all, it isn't toxic to cats! :)
13:38:18 <dylan> unlike most other indoor plants.
13:38:33 <sm> indoor plants are toxic to cats ?
13:38:40 <Ulfalizer> on the other hand they probably confuse it with their litter-box..
13:38:44 <dylan> many commonly sold ones are.
13:38:51 <LordBrain> i thought about an indoor plant, but someone told me really there is no such thing
13:38:56 <dylan> Ulfalizer: they didn't, the grass was too thick
13:38:59 <Ulfalizer> cats eat indoor plants?
13:39:14 <dylan> mine do.
13:39:18 <dylan> they like to chew on leaves.
13:39:25 <Ulfalizer> heh
13:39:31 <dylan> also, eating some grass is good for them.
13:39:39 <dylan> So when they'd graze my indoor lawn, it wasn't bad.
13:40:09 <Ulfalizer> saves some work i guess.. :)
13:40:17 <LordBrain> in the future, everyone will live in those giant concrete pipes like homeless people like.
13:40:49 <dylan> "we all live in a yellow concrete pipe / yellow concrete pipe / yellow concrete pipe"...
13:40:56 <LordBrain> lol
13:42:19 <xerox> monochrom: will you appear? %)
13:42:58 <monochrom> No, I have to mow my thesis.
13:43:31 <xerox> Gawd.
13:44:25 <monochrom> heh
13:45:54 <SamB> your thesis is that big?
13:46:00 <SamB> that you need to mow it?
13:46:39 <Cale> heh, I just thought of a good idea for a comic. It would be a picture of a giant beetle staring at a closed door. Underneath, it would read: Ever since that fateful morning, the words "Don't come in, I'm changing!" never quite seemed the same to Gregor Samsa.
13:47:39 <norpan> hey, that's the guy from the metarmorphosis
13:47:44 <xerox> hehe, yes.
13:47:51 <xerox> Karfa.
13:47:55 <Cale> Kafka
13:47:59 <pflanze> Hello.
13:48:08 <xerox> Ooops, can't type.
13:48:12 <norpan> me neither
13:48:28 <pflanze> How can I make ghc read source files as utf-8?
13:48:38 <xerox> Just peeking to show you GHCi On Acid, then run off <http://img227.imageshack.us/my.php?image=goafg3.jpg>
13:49:11 <xerox> (Spot the pattern! ;))
13:49:35 <Cale> pflanze: Get GHC 6.5
13:49:52 <Cale> pflanze: It's not in the current stable release
13:50:37 <pflanze> ok, thanks.
13:50:41 <norpan> :pl in ghc?
13:50:46 <Ulfalizer> xerox: is there a stable ghc for intel macs yet?
13:54:45 <Ulfalizer> monochrom: thanks for the link on strict fields by the way
13:56:23 <monochrom> You're welcome
14:02:55 <mahogny> hm. anyone has any idea how common all these haskell programmers are? or easily convertible programmers. aren't most universities teaching functional programming nowadays? just considering how easy/hard it would be to hire any
14:03:48 <Philippa> finding good ones won't be easy, but they'll tend to be good programmers generally as well
14:04:17 <Philippa> people who've worked in ocaml or scheme or similar are going to need some time to adjust, especially to monads
14:04:27 <mahogny> think one would need to consider world-wide to get them?
14:04:38 <Philippa> the History of Haskell paper may help get an idea of how widely taught it is
14:04:46 <Philippa> depends how many you need and where you're based
14:04:47 <mahogny> yeah, read it
14:04:51 <lispy> someone looking for haskell programmers?
14:04:55 <mahogny> sweden :)
14:05:04 <mahogny> I guess starting up near gothenburg is a good idea :P
14:05:09 <mahogny> lispy: well, not now, maybe later
14:05:13 <LordBrain> i'm a haskell programmer in need of work
14:05:16 <lispy> i'd move to sweden for a haskell job :)
14:05:26 <LordBrain> yeah... i'd seriously consider moving to sweden too
14:05:40 * mahogny might need to hire... in a year
14:05:55 <lispy> i think when i finish my masters i'm going to try galois...if i could get a job there i'd probably be set
14:06:10 <Ulfalizer> mahogny: you've started a business?
14:06:47 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: oh, we've had a family business for over ten years. but when I take over fully then we'll move into software as well probably.
14:06:50 <Failure02> what's galois?
14:07:00 <Ulfalizer> ok, what do you do now?
14:07:03 <mahogny> Failure02: well known company. uses haskell for secure software
14:07:23 <Failure02> cool
14:07:23 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: mechanical engineering. developing rotating joints for the fiber industry. mainly that
14:07:42 <Ulfalizer> ok, sounds lucrative :)
14:07:46 * edwardk waves ello
14:07:51 * lispy waves back
14:08:15 <mahogny> anyway, it would be haskell for computational stuff in that case
14:08:34 <mahogny> dunno how well acquinted haskell programmers are with numerical analysis :)
14:08:49 <edwardk> some of us are =)
14:08:53 <edwardk> whats up?
14:09:00 <lispy> numerical analysis is hard...i took one term of it..interesting but nebulous
14:09:14 <LordBrain> hmm i didnt find it hard
14:09:15 <mahogny> edwardk: ah, might need to hire some people in a year or so
14:09:30 <LordBrain> but yeah i only took one course, i'm sure the rabbit hole goes a lot deeper.
14:09:40 <edwardk> k, well, feel free to look me up then =)
14:09:51 <mahogny> I'll prolly post here in that case
14:10:05 <lispy> mahogny: i think you'll find lots of #haskellers are excited about professional haskell programming :)
14:10:14 <mahogny> yeah :)
14:10:23 <edwardk> yeah, funnny how much demand outstrips supply for numerical analysts. no one wants to go into it for their mathematical career, but there is a fair bit of demand.
14:11:00 <lispy> yeah, mathematically speaking i found algebra and number theory to be far more exiciting
14:11:15 <lispy> but those areas seem to have a lot of people already :)
14:11:22 <edwardk> mostly satisfied by engineers, who don't really understand the mathematics behind why one approach converges and another doesn't
14:11:23 <mahogny> edwardk: oh. I want to ;)
14:11:52 <monochrom> Perhaps I should implement a numerical programmer.
14:11:57 <mahogny> lol
14:11:59 <edwardk> I can't recall how many times I've heard an engineer or physicist say 'and we assume the fourier series converges...' =)
14:12:30 <edwardk> or more likely omit those very words
14:12:32 <mahogny> edwardk: I can't recall how many times I've seen people who totally has no clue even how to check that
14:12:51 <edwardk> yeah
14:14:45 <edwardk> Of course, last engineer that I tried to get to read Stein & Shakarchi after a statement like that had his head explode and we never really did get the smell out of the carpet.
14:15:15 <mahogny> edwardk: LOL
14:15:58 <mahogny> edwardk: well, some engineers know their ways in it. but they don't grow on trees. here at chalmers, we were three one year to go in direction of mathematics, of which one jumped off :)
14:16:00 <mwc> I must be using STArray and ST completely wrong. I had to beat a really simple function with a ridiculous amount of explicit type annotation to make something work
14:16:03 <Ulfalizer> ugh.. damn pollen
14:16:17 * Ulfalizer flings some snot on the channel
14:16:20 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: so what's up now?
14:16:26 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: just vacation?
14:16:28 <mwc> quick_sort :: (Ord e) => [e] -> [e]
14:16:28 <mwc> quick_sort (list :: [e]) = (runST :: (forall s . ST s [e]) -> [e]) (do
14:16:28 <mwc>     let len = length list
14:16:28 <mwc>     (arr :: STArray s Int e) <- newListArray (0,len-1) list
14:16:28 <mwc>     do_quick_sort arr 0 len
14:16:29 <mwc>     (getElems :: STArray s Int e -> ST s [e]) arr)
14:16:34 <monochrom> mwc that's actually normal :)
14:16:37 <mwc> trying to implement a procedural, in place quicksort
14:16:54 <Ulfalizer> mahogny: yup, working on my IV program, and a irc bot written in haskell :)
14:17:18 <mwc> monochrom, any idea why I couldn't use (runST :: ... ) $ do ....
14:17:32 <Ulfalizer> +n
14:17:37 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: one bot ain't enough? :) what's the diploma?
14:17:52 <monochrom> Very wicked 2nd-rank polymorphism and monomorphism restriction and ...
14:18:02 <mahogny> :)
14:18:15 <mwc> yeah, I figured it was some sort of scary rank 2 type stuff
14:18:15 <LordBrain> how optimized is the List.sort in ghc?
14:18:25 <Ulfalizer> mahogny: the nasty thing with working on irc bots is that you get reminded of the "boten anna" song all the time :/
14:18:30 <LordBrain> soes it do in place?
14:18:33 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: lol
14:18:34 <edwardk> ulf: haha
14:18:54 <LordBrain> i suppose it wouldnt
14:18:56 <monochrom> Sorting is not the only use of STArrays.
14:19:06 <mwc> is there a good tutorial on rank-2 types around?
14:19:28 <mwc> I'm kind of doing this blind
14:19:29 <edwardk> i've been popping that song up to terrorize a swedish coworker of mine somewhat randomly at work. apparently he was visitng sweden right around graduation and everyone was driving around playing the song, so he's rather PTSD about it now.
14:19:50 <monochrom> mwc I think you already know everything you need to know.
14:20:05 <mwc> monochrom, they scare the bejesus out of me?
14:20:21 <mwc> I mean, what they're used for. how the qualification of s prevents the state from leaking out, that sort of stuff
14:20:41 <Ulfalizer> edwardk: be thankful you don't understand swedish
14:20:42 <edwardk> how good is the performance on ST based refs?
14:20:51 <mwc> I don't really understand how that works, I've read lazy functional state threads by Peyton Jones, and I didn't really understand how it worked
14:20:55 <edwardk> ulf: heh i've read the translation
14:21:18 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: new hacker attack: take control of the computer and stream the song
14:21:27 <edwardk> ulf: (my family is half swedish, so i kind of have a passing understanding, but can't say anything in it to save my life)
14:21:47 <Ulfalizer> edwardk: some things are untranslatably irritating :/
14:21:52 <edwardk> ulf: heh
14:21:59 <mahogny> :)
14:22:21 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: now I'm just waiting for Perrra to end up on common radio :P
14:22:28 <Ulfalizer> mahogny: i guess that'd be a kind of DOS attack, where the S is the persons mental resources
14:22:39 <Ulfalizer> '
14:22:46 <mahogny> or just Denial Of Sleep
14:22:51 <Ulfalizer> mahogny: perrra?
14:23:19 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: yes. a really big name in the scene many years ago. much larger than basshunter. I have no clue where this guy just popped out from
14:23:33 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: similar songs in content
14:23:49 <mahogny> just pray that it won't happen
14:23:54 <Ulfalizer> ok
14:23:57 <monochrom> The problem is actually in the STArray operations all being overloaded from MArray.
14:24:22 <Ulfalizer> i dunno what "scene" basshunter is from, but i'm grateful i've never been in it :)
14:24:29 <mwc> monochrom, yeah, I've had similar headaches dealing with IArray
14:24:32 <mahogny> Ulfalizer: demo scene
14:24:52 <mwc> but this rank2 type wierdness has me adding things in and seeing if it'll compile in an iterative cycle
14:25:01 <Ulfalizer> never heard of him before that song though
14:25:02 <mahogny> hmmm! has any demo ever been made using haskell? otherwise it is about time
14:25:54 <mahogny> bbl
14:26:32 <monochrom> Yeah, so, you use an MArray operation, and you have to manually specify you want STArray.  That forces you to mention s.  But then the s you mention in STArray is not interpreted as the same s in runST due to both Haskell convention and 2nd rank and possibly monomorphism.
14:26:48 <edwardk> so hat is so hard about this year's ICFP problem?
14:26:51 <edwardk> er what?
14:28:30 <monochrom> Is it hard after you have deciphered the codex?
14:29:25 <edwardk> well once you have the codex deciphered you are given the specs for the virtual machine
14:29:32 <edwardk> so that part seems easy
14:32:56 <xerox> monochrom: OK for the convention, and check for monomorphism too, what is the second rank?
14:34:45 <monochrom> runST :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -> a    as opposed to  forall a s. ST s a -> a
14:37:20 <xerox> I saw this difference in an Oleg code, which in turn I actually applied to my own code, and I can see the difference, but I can't say it in words
14:37:42 <xerox> That perhaps mean I can't exactly see that
14:37:57 <norpan> there is a big difference
14:38:03 <monochrom> Buddhism is like that too. :)
14:38:59 * SyntaxNinja pokes xerox
14:39:12 * xerox pokes back
14:39:45 <SyntaxNinja> LordBrain: where do you live now? Galois is hiring actually.
14:39:50 <xerox> SyntaxNinja: you are perfectly right, I have devoted nearly no time to the project; but I have done now
14:40:01 <LordBrain> Florida
14:40:11 <SyntaxNinja> <--- was born in Fl
14:40:20 <LordBrain> cool
14:40:30 <xerox> I went to school with a guy from Florida
14:40:42 <LordBrain> SyntaxNinja: you work at Galois?
14:40:43 <xerox> We both took the maximum vote in the English class (we were child)
14:40:58 <SyntaxNinja> LordBrain: yeah. i need to hire someone for my team actually.
14:41:19 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: the maximum score?
14:41:24 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: so you've spent time on soc?
14:41:28 <xerox> That.
14:41:43 <LordBrain> oregon, you know what i was already thinking of moving there, interesting
14:41:43 <xerox> Yes, I am actually reading the code and trying to make sense of it
14:42:23 <xerox> It's nice that it actualy makes use of the Cabal code, but that makes me start reading it too, and it is taking some time to push everything up in the head
14:43:35 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: Cabal is a good thing to stuff your head with :P
14:43:48 <xerox> Indeed! The code is so clearly written!
14:44:04 <SyntaxNinja> but focus on trying to understand one piece at a time.  only do like 1 hour of "general" code reading, and then start tryign to understand specific aspects of it.
14:44:08 * xerox also enjoys the plentifulness of comments
14:44:08 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: why thank you.
14:44:42 <xerox> "It's in the types!"
14:45:34 <norpan> documentation just gets outdatet
14:45:36 <norpan> d
14:46:01 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: are you being sarcastic? :P
14:46:26 <xerox> haha no, not in this specific case - quite the opposite.
14:46:34 <SyntaxNinja> cabal is like 4000 lines of code or something. that's about 20,000 if it were C, right? ;)
14:46:44 <SyntaxNinja> LordBrain: send me your resume.
14:46:59 <xerox> </b0rg voice>
14:48:20 <SyntaxNinja> hey now
14:48:37 <SyntaxNinja> how many people do you actually know who work for galois
14:48:49 <xerox> Hmmm, you.
14:49:16 <xerox> You've got there bringert and audreyt, but I don't think they work there.
14:49:42 <mwc> monochrom, yeah, I have up and just beat it with the type annotation stick.
14:49:46 <mwc> I have it working now
14:50:04 <mwc> now to run it against haskell's sort
14:50:39 * edwardk perks up at the word 'hiring' =)
14:51:12 <fasta> What is exactly the convention regarding higher-ranked types you were talking about?
14:51:55 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: they don't work here, they came here to give talks
14:52:07 <SyntaxNinja> and any time anyone wants to come give a talk for Galois, let me know :)
14:52:11 <SyntaxNinja> we have weekly technical seminars
14:52:15 <xerox> That implies audience! :-)
14:52:19 <fasta> Or: where is the documentation for that behaviour?
14:52:27 <xerox> Got you :P
14:52:41 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: for future reference, would Galois pay transport?
14:53:48 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: probably not for a talk. but if you're in the 'hood anyway (ICFP is just a few miles away from galois this year, and we're hosting the GHC hackathon) then you should let us know so we can set something up.
14:53:59 <SyntaxNinja> both audrey and bringert were in seattle.
14:54:13 <Philippa> OK, will do in the event that ever happens
14:54:29 <Philippa> no doubt I can find something worth talking about
14:54:44 * SyntaxNinja nods
14:54:44 <Philippa> even if it's something like "ML-style modules and what went wrong with AOP"
14:54:52 <edwardk> haha
14:55:28 * edwardk doesn't mind AOP in moderation.
14:55:39 <edwardk> I just don't think it scales or is a magic bullet for every problem.
14:55:39 <vincenz> > ord('0')
14:55:41 <lambdabot>  48
14:55:54 <Philippa> edwardk: a feature SyntaxNinja rather liked in one of my projects was basically using a stack of what'd be functors to do something AOP-like around an API
14:56:16 * edwardk nods.
14:56:44 <Philippa> between that trick and techniques like monads there's a lot of stuff that's sort-of near AOP in the design space that can be done in haskell, and it's all a lot safer
14:56:53 <edwardk> I do some AOP-type stuff these days in javascript. I use it to go through and pointcut in event support for method calls matching certain signatures on objects or prototypes.
14:57:01 <Philippa> (OK, monads and monad transformers)
14:57:08 * edwardk nods.
14:57:35 <Philippa> the big difference is that the possible join points're pre-specified - though at least it's comparatively easy to refactor if you need more
14:57:53 <edwardk> AOP just struck me as a bunch of the old metaclass stuff given a shiny new label.
14:58:17 <Philippa> and hyped, and done in languages that aren't suited to it
14:58:22 <edwardk> but i try to keep with current terminology lest i sound like a dinosaur.
14:58:23 <edwardk> yeah
14:58:32 <edwardk> its embarassingly easy in things like javascript
14:59:29 <edwardk> http://slipwave.info/jslib/js/aop/Aspect.js is an entire AOP implementation ;)
15:00:47 <edwardk> relies on the fact that i can apply pointcuts to a prototype, so i can use it after the class is defined in javascript
15:00:55 <edwardk> gives me more flexibility than the aspectj approach
15:01:40 <edwardk> also benefits from the fact that i can apply it to a single object and not just a class.
15:05:28 <fasta> What is exactly the "convention" regarding higher-ranked types you were talking about? I have never seen a rule that stated that "s" should not be equal to "a". I am interested in seeing that rule.
15:09:21 <magnus--> Gah... It takes me+haskell several minutes to read in a 2 megabyte file into a Word32 array :)
15:10:10 <magnus--> I think i'll be better off in C++ for icfp
15:11:23 * cjay tried last year with some people with c++, in the end we gave up because of all the segfaults ;)
15:12:09 <magnus--> hehe
15:53:10 <shapr> d00d
15:53:50 <edwardk> heya shapr
15:54:50 <shapr> y0 edwardk
15:55:28 <shapr> Hey, I mentioned you in my blog. Is there a better url for you than the linguistlist writeup?
15:55:38 <edwardk> http://slipwave.info/
15:55:46 <shapr> grr
15:55:48 <shapr> cat on the keyboard
15:56:37 <edwardk> i probably should make a blog or something some day, but the closest i've come is that tiddlywiki i slapped up at the slipwave url
15:56:57 * shapr checks the logs.
15:57:21 <edwardk> i own slipwave.* so, since the original slipwave project never took off, maybe i should relink everything over to slipwave.com or something
15:58:16 <shapr> I own ScannedInAvian.*
15:58:54 <edwardk> i used to own a bunch of domains back in the day, but then one year i moved and the registrar i was using didn't send my update letters to my new address, etc.
15:59:15 <shapr> And honestly, domains are cheesy anyway.
15:59:23 <edwardk> so i lost kmett.com and the one for the personal website i'd used for about a decade prior
15:59:26 <shapr> I'd rather have a peer to peer ant trail kind of thing.
15:59:33 <edwardk> heh
15:59:39 <shapr> I've written about it on my old blog...
15:59:41 <edwardk> bang paths anyone?
15:59:50 <edwardk> kind of a reversion to the way things were =)
16:00:00 <shapr> Yeah, bang paths for concepts.
16:00:15 <shapr> edwardk's meaning of tornado code
16:00:38 <shapr> A weather guy's meaning of tornado code would be something else entirely.
16:00:48 * edwardk nods.
16:01:19 <shapr> Anyway, sleep is calling me. I'm moving into my new apartment tomorrow!
16:01:21 * shapr boings!
16:01:35 <shapr> edwardk: Are you older than me?
16:01:39 <edwardk> alrighty, then go get some sleep. i'll be online =)
16:01:40 <edwardk> heh
16:01:44 <edwardk> depends on how old you are =)
16:01:48 * edwardk is 30.
16:01:51 <shapr> Oh
16:01:54 <shapr> I'm older than you...
16:02:08 <shapr> I'm 34.
16:02:28 * shapr &
16:02:55 * edwardk goes off to multitask.
16:04:11 <madpickle> i'm 10
16:04:17 <madpickle> but don't tell my mom i'm in #haskell
16:04:19 <madpickle> she prefers LISP
16:04:32 <edwardk> there is no real viable MPI interface for haskell is there?
16:04:59 <edwardk> i notice the parallel haskell folks don't seem to have gotten around to it, and the older implementations appear to be several years old.
16:09:34 <dolmen> non
16:09:47 <dolmen> d'ailleurs il n'en parlent mÃªme pas sur #haskell !
16:10:27 <monochrom> I am able to minimize the number of manual type annotations in applications of STArrays.
16:10:35 <monochrom> To 1.
16:10:42 <edwardk> nifty keen
16:11:48 <SyntaxNinja> does anyone know of easy-to-deploy web voting/polling/survey software?
16:11:50 <edwardk> I like the ST* hierarchy. I think its a neat idea, but I wish any of the writeups said ANYTHING about the resulting effect on algorithmic complexity
16:12:39 <monochrom> Annotate newArray or newListArray or newArray_.  Then the rest are inferred.  You can do it inline, or you can create a new name such as newArrayST and type that.
16:12:54 <edwardk> ah
16:14:35 <monochrom> Example 1.  do { a <- (newArray :: (Ix i) => (i,i) -> e -> ST s (STArray s i e)) (1,10) True; ... }
16:15:15 <monochrom> Example 2.  Define newArrayST :: (Ix i) => (i,i) -> e -> ST s (STArray s i e); newArrayST = newArray.  Then use newArrayST.
16:15:41 <monochrom> You may also replace i or e by concrete types if that suits you.
16:15:42 <edwardk> monochrom: have you found anything on the complexity/time impact of writeSTRef?
16:16:49 <edwardk> the internal representation of s in ST s is opaque, so its kind of hard to say anything about the complexity of the code once you invoke the ST monad
16:16:54 <monochrom> No, but I expect them to be just a dereference followed by a write, plus possibly function call overhead.  I don't actually know these things.
16:18:12 <edwardk> hrmm, but they claim to be purely functional no? so wouldn't that necessitate the maintenance of a tree or something to minimize the construction time? i mean yeah you could implement ST with IORefs behind the scenes, but that kindof ruins the conceptual model.
16:18:46 <edwardk> since the main motivation of ST was to be able to implement stuff in a pure functional setting
16:20:25 * edwinb grrs at google for asking if I meant 'gcc' when I do a search including the keyword 'ghc'
16:21:34 <monochrom> The internal implementation of ST is destructive in-place update.  Also strict execution order in the ST monad, i.e., "x >>= y" the destructive updates in x are executed whether y needs it or not.  However, since this is linearly threaded and the internal state cannot escape, when you slab on runST you get back a pure function.
16:22:32 * edwardk nods.
16:22:38 <monochrom> So, I expect it to be space efficient (no thunks).  I also expect it to be fast if my own programming doesn't do wasteful evaluations/updates.
16:25:01 <monochrom> Only slowdowns: 1. writeSTRef/readSTRef are written as function calls, are they inlined?  I don't know.  2. There is a dereferencing in every access.  Think of writing like "*x = *y + *z" in C all the time. :)
16:25:26 <edwardk> afk a sec.
17:47:42 <dolmen> Anyone doing ICFP ?
17:48:07 <ndm> dolmen, a load of ICFP'ing Haskell people were on #oasis earlier
18:21:33 <lispy> when is icfp contest?
18:21:35 <lispy> is that right now?

18:28:07 <lambdabot> http://icfpcontest.org/
18:28:09 <lambdabot> Done.
18:28:11 <lambdabot> :)
18:28:20 <lispy> wow, that's some lag
18:28:22 <int-e> @where+ icfp2006 http://icfpcontest.org/
18:28:23 <lambdabot> Done.
18:28:45 <int-e> I didn't mean to change anything.
18:31:33 <lispy> can someone update the channel topic to mention the contest?
18:31:37 <lispy> say that it's started

18:33:20 <lispy> thanks
20:08:13 <u221e> Is changing the value of an IORef expensive?
20:19:09 <sjanssen> u221e: I think it does some locking (but don't quote me on that)
20:22:01 <RyanT5000> u221e: it's atomic - which could be slightly expensive depending on the hardware/implementation
20:22:59 <RyanT5000> on intel, it can be done in hardware, and will only cause a measurable performance hit on a SMP machine
20:23:06 <RyanT5000> (cache snooping and stuff)
20:23:16 <sjanssen> don't you love it when you spend 2 hours poring over a piece of code and finally realize you wrote 'a' when you meant '0'?
20:24:03 <RyanT5000> lol, my personal favorite is incorrect but properly-nesting bracketing
20:24:29 <sjanssen> ooh, that's rough too
20:24:31 <RyanT5000> when it somehow doesn't cause a syntax error, but it's completely wrong
20:24:38 <RyanT5000> i got that a few times in C++
20:25:21 <RyanT5000> autoformat is helpful but not a cure-all
20:39:40 <u221e> Is there any advantage to forkIO over forkOS?
20:44:01 <RyanT5000> its lighter-weight
20:44:11 <RyanT5000> it's
20:45:09 <RyanT5000> my understanding is that not only is the original forkIO call cheaper, task switches between forkIO threads are also cheaper than "real" task switches
20:46:10 <RyanT5000> also, i think forkIO threads won't duplicate lazy computations, whereas forkOS will (sometimes? all the time? i dunno)
20:46:46 <sjanssen> u221e: forkIO is what you should use.  If you needed forkOS, you'd probably know
20:47:04 <RyanT5000> you tend to need forkOS only if you're trying to multithread foreign calls
20:47:18 <SamB_XP> dons: why is there no @wordnet command?
20:47:26 <RyanT5000> e.g.: i used it to make separate message-processing and frame-rendering threads in my application
20:47:43 <petekaz> RyanT5000: but even then doesn't that happen automatically?
20:48:16 <RyanT5000> petekaz: no; two foreign calls in two different forkIO threads will (potentially, at least) block each other
20:48:20 <petekaz> forkIO when it hits a foreign call will run in its own OS thread.
20:48:32 <sjanssen> petekaz: with GHC 6.4, only one forkIO runs at a time
20:49:09 <petekaz> What about the -thread option?  I thought there were enhancements to the RTS?
20:49:26 <petekaz> Not SMP stuff.
20:49:26 <RyanT5000> petekaz: i know that if i use forkIO instead of forkOS in my program (running on 6.4.2) glSwapBuffers and SDL_GetEvent will block each other
20:50:40 <petekaz> The single OS thread that does the scheduling, when it runs a forkIO that contains a foreign call, it then spawns a new OS thread to take over scheduling while the slow blocking foreign call completes.
20:50:51 <petekaz> I just read a whole paper on this I thought.
20:50:59 <RyanT5000> lol i'm not telling you how it works, just what it does
20:51:16 <RyanT5000> and i definitely needed to use forkOS or my program was way slow
20:52:02 <RyanT5000> maybe the paper you read was relevant to HEAD?
20:52:26 <petekaz> no, but maybe your calls depend on thread local state so you need forkOS?
20:52:44 <petekaz> I'm searching for the paper now.
20:52:53 <RyanT5000> no, in fact i didn't even want to run them in different threads
20:53:02 <RyanT5000> i had to go to trouble to copy the OpenGL context across threads
20:54:49 <petekaz> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ghc/comm/rts-libs/multi-thread.html
20:54:50 <lambdabot> Title: The GHC Commentary - Supporting multi-threaded interoperation
20:57:21 <petekaz> RyanT5000: are you using the -threaded option?
20:57:25 <RyanT5000> yep
20:58:21 <RyanT5000> ghc-prof-options: -auto-all -osuf p_o
20:58:21 <RyanT5000> ghc-options: -threaded -fglasgow-exts -O2 -Wall
21:00:05 <RyanT5000> btw, i think if it were to automatically spawn a new thread for me, it'd be even worse, becuase then either the OpenGL or the SDL threadlocal stuff would be messed up
21:00:24 <petekaz> if you have thread local stuff, you have to use forkOS.
21:00:39 <RyanT5000> yeah, but it was working with forkIO, just really slowly
21:00:44 <petekaz> I just tested this the other day as well.
21:01:09 <petekaz> I read from stdin, thus blocking, and nothing ran in other forked IO threads.
21:01:33 <RyanT5000> yeah
21:01:39 <petekaz> but when I used -threaded, a new OS thread was spawed automatically, and my other threads ran.
21:01:55 <petekaz> I verified all of this by watching the OS threads via ps.
21:02:11 <petekaz> It works just like erlang's vm does.
21:02:30 <RyanT5000> well i can't say for sure, i guess, that it was the switch from forkIO to forkOS that solved it, because i did change a lot of other stuff around at the time
21:02:40 <RyanT5000> but that was certainly the impression i was left with
21:02:45 <RyanT5000> if i have some spare time later i'll check
21:02:48 <petekaz> I think it was wrong.
21:03:00 <RyanT5000> i definitely agree that what you're saying seems to be what should be the case
21:07:25 <alar> if it's not too much trouble, please, send lambdabot to #instant-chaos
21:24:57 <vincenz> > take 500 $ iterate (+1) 1
21:24:59 <lambdabot>  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,...
21:25:01 <vincenz> > sum $ take 500 $ iterate (+1) 1
21:25:03 <lambdabot>  125250
21:25:07 <vincenz> > product $ take 500 $ iterate (+1) 1
21:25:08 <lambdabot>  1220136825991110068701238785423046926253574342803192842192413588385845373153...
21:29:16 <dons> lambdabot, @join #instant-chaos
21:29:20 <dons> alar, done
21:33:29 <u221e> Whoops, I forgot about the icfp contest ;)
21:34:06 * bringert is going to stop now
21:34:22 <bringert> it was fun, but I don't want to do it all weekend
21:35:35 <u221e> Looks like an interesting task too
21:35:50 * edwardk nods.
21:36:12 <edwardk> the virtual machine itself is pretty trivial, its that decoding process that should keep people up nights ;)
21:37:06 <alar> dons: thanks alot!
21:43:42 <u221e> Does a module have to be a single source file?
21:44:19 <RyanT5000> u221e: yes, but it can import other modules and re-export them
21:44:22 <dons> Go Lazy Bottoms!
21:44:26 <RyanT5000> or re-export only certain things from them
21:44:56 <RyanT5000> (which is why you actually get stuff when you import just Foreign, for example)
21:45:13 <u221e> Seems kind of restrictive...
21:45:29 <RyanT5000> why?
21:45:30 <edwardk> u221e: well you can use the c preprocessor and #include if you really want to
21:46:16 <RyanT5000> import and re-export is basically equivalent, and requires adding about 2 lines of code
21:46:21 <edwardk> yeah
21:46:52 <edwardk> well, modulo circular module dependencies which from skimming docs some haskell compilers don't support
21:47:08 <RyanT5000> ah, true
21:48:43 * edwardk jusst realized how any haskell papers he's been reading lately. i stacked them up next to my laptop and they are the same size...
21:48:46 <edwardk> with the laptop open =)
21:49:08 <RyanT5000> lol
21:50:25 <edwardk> thankfully most were printed out on the comp sci department printer =)
21:56:09 <petekaz> what is the runtime option to change the number of OS worker threads used?
22:01:49 <vincenz> > max [1,2,3]
22:01:50 <lambdabot>  Add a type signature
22:01:53 <vincenz> > max [1,2,3] :: Int
22:01:54 <lambdabot>    Expecting a function type, but found `Int'
22:01:55 <lambdabot>    Expected type: Int
22:01:55 <lambdabot>   ...
22:02:01 <vincenz> @type max
22:02:02 <lambdabot> forall a. (Ord a) => a -> a -> a
22:02:10 <vincenz> > maximum [1..10]
22:02:12 <lambdabot>  10
22:04:36 <dylan> > maximum [1..]
22:04:40 <lambdabot> Terminated
22:11:08 <Eidolos> > foldl (+) [1..10]
22:11:09 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num [a])
22:17:59 <RyanT5000> > foldl (+) 0 [1..10]
22:18:00 <lambdabot>  55
22:28:28 <vincenz> @hoogle dropWhile
22:28:29 <lambdabot> Prelude.dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
22:28:30 <lambdabot> Data.PackedString.dropWhilePS :: (Char -> Bool) -> PackedString -> PackedString
22:41:55 <vincenz> > replicate -1 'a'
22:41:56 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num (Char -> Int -> a -> [a]))
22:42:00 <vincenz> > replicate (-1) 'a'
22:42:01 <lambdabot>  ""
22:46:43 <RyanT5000> how is it that the instance Show String is specialized?
22:46:52 <RyanT5000> isn't that undecideable?
22:47:27 <RyanT5000> instance Show String vs. instance Show a => Show [a] and instance Show Char
23:16:46 <goltrpoat> OT, but this made me laugh:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion#The_Plumbbob_test  <-- "uh.. guys?  you know that 900kg capping plate we had?  i think i mayve just launched it into outer space"
