00:00:03 <Cale> You would be silly to do so.
00:00:47 <normal-dude> ok
00:00:48 <edwardk> i tend to alternate between java and perl and er.. server side flowscript running javascript... for web stuff depending on application
00:00:52 <normal-dude> but is mod perl cgi?
00:00:56 <normal-dude> I dont thnk
00:01:18 <edwardk> mod perl is close to cgi it uses a lot of the conventions, but no technically its not
00:01:44 <edwardk> yu can write cgi's in anything was my way of saying anything can write code for the web.
00:02:15 <edwardk> i've written commercial websites as m4 macros =)
00:02:32 <u221e> Something is wrong here...
00:02:40 <edwardk> whats up u221e?
00:02:44 <wli> CGI in plain old Haskell is pretty easy.
00:03:31 <u221e> edwardk, what's up? This: http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=mandelbrot&lang=all
00:03:33 <lambdabot> Title: mandelbrot benchmark | Gentoo : Intel&#174; Pentium&#174;&nbsp;4 Computer Langua ...
00:03:47 <normal-dude> can u  do enterprise level websites in cgi?
00:03:49 <edwardk> we got spanked? =)
00:03:59 <u221e> Mine is Haskell #3
00:04:07 <u221e> It should not be slower
00:04:27 <u221e> Everyone who has tested it says it's faster then Haskell #2
00:04:43 <edwardk> different ghc version?
00:05:27 <u221e> I don't think so.
00:05:38 <u221e> Take a look at the debian benchmarks.
00:05:53 <u221e> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/debian/benchmark.php?test=mandelbrot&lang=all
00:05:54 <lambdabot> Title: mandelbrot benchmark | Debian : AMD&#8482; Sempron&#8482; Computer Language Shoo ...
00:05:56 <normal-dude> gcc much faster
00:06:04 <normal-dude> so if you are a c master
00:06:06 <edwardk> they don't include compile time in the benchmark do they? =)
00:06:12 <normal-dude> u are the lord of the rings?
00:06:51 <Cale> normal-dude: GHC beats gcc at various benchmarks too
00:06:53 <normal-dude> this audio is giving me a scheme hardon
00:06:58 <normal-dude> !!
00:07:00 <normal-dude> it does?
00:07:04 <Cale> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=chameneos&lang=all
00:07:05 <lambdabot> Title: chameneos benchmark | Gentoo : Intel&#174; Pentium&#174;&nbsp;4 Computer Languag ...
00:07:07 <normal-dude> so why haskell over scheme?
00:07:37 <edwardk> better typing, faster code, pure, referential transparency, monads expand your brain, etc. =)
00:07:39 <Cale> normal-dude: The extremely nice type system, prettier syntax (depending on your view)
00:07:42 <Cale> Laziness
00:07:56 <Cale> and all the stuff edwardk said
00:07:58 <u221e> This does not make sense either
00:08:00 <u221e> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/fulldata.php?test=mandelbrot&p1=gcc-3&p2=ghc-2&p3=ghc-3&p4=ocaml-0
00:08:01 <lambdabot> Title: mandelbrot full data | Gentoo : Intel&#174; Pentium&#174;&nbsp;4 Computer Langua ...
00:08:09 <normal-dude> what oes that do or me as a programmer?
00:08:15 <u221e> GHC is doing something weird with the pentium 4
00:08:17 <edwardk> u221e: cache size differences?
00:08:45 <edwardk> i don't own any intel made chips any more so i can't help out
00:08:58 <Cale> normal-dude: It has a ton of implications. One of which is that if code compiles, it usually works.
00:09:25 <u221e> I have a 1.4Ghx Althon Thunderbird... it does n=3000 in alittle over 6 seconds.
00:09:42 <Cale> (far more often than scheme programs or programs written in languages with less powerful type systems)
00:09:58 <edwardk> yeah i wrote a couple hundred lines of code for a part of my project. not only did it work the first time after it compiled, i was able to run a bunch of automated quickchecks to test it. and quickcheck used the type system to build its checks  =)
00:10:21 <Cale> Laziness lets you do things like work with infinite data structures, and helps a lot in breaking up code and increasing modularity/code reuse.
00:11:52 <Cale> Monads are an abstraction, which, to butcher the description, let you design embedded languages which are ideal for the particular sort of problem you're working on.
00:12:18 <Cale> Kind of like macros do, but the details are completely different.
00:12:49 <Cale> Referential transparency makes it far easier to think about your code.
00:13:31 <edwardk> monads and macros tend to have a lot in common
00:13:31 <Cale> If f is a function, and you apply it to the value 5, and it gives 7, you know that it will always give 7.
00:13:50 <edwardk> i do have to admit that there are times when i miss easy macros
00:13:57 <u221e> Ok, I found something... The AMD system uses gcc 4.1 and the Intel system uses version 3.3.5
00:14:09 <edwardk> there ya go
00:14:18 <edwardk> now downgrade and test your heart out =)
00:14:19 <normal-dude> python vs scheme comparison lol
00:14:21 <normal-dude> :)
00:14:30 <normal-dude> this guy is funy as hell
00:14:37 <edwardk> well, thats a lot closer to apples-to-apples =)
00:14:41 <normal-dude> http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=644
00:15:14 <u221e> Is the ghc native code compiler any good?
00:15:18 <Cale> yeah, I caught the link when edwardk posted it :)
00:15:55 <edwardk> thats anbout the only netcast on there worth listening to.
00:16:11 <edwardk> there is one  from a perl guy but he's not much on the science side of computer science.
00:16:17 <Cale> u221e: Try it? :)
00:16:54 <Cale> u221e: I think it's supposed to be reasonably decent, but I'm really not sure how it compares at that level of precision :)
00:17:47 <u221e> I should ask, is the native code generation any good in GHC 6.4.1
00:23:35 <normal-dude> where do i get this video?
00:24:01 <u221e> Ok, I just tried the -fasm option... no difference in speed, that's good.
00:24:09 <edwardk> i don;t think there is an actual video, did you have the slides up as it went by?
00:28:48 <Pegazus> one question, why does (+1) works?
00:29:04 <Cale> Pegazus: because it's special syntax
00:29:28 <Pegazus> how's that?
00:29:32 <Pegazus> PD: hi cale :)
00:29:38 <Cale> and desugars to  flip (+) 1
00:30:05 <Pegazus> why's that?
00:30:36 <Cale> Well, if op is an operator symbol, (op e) = \x -> x op e
00:30:37 <Pegazus> i think it's quite confusing :)
00:30:56 <Pegazus> why's that? ((op e) = \x -> x op e)
00:31:03 <Cale> Why?
00:31:11 <Pegazus> i mean +1 means nothing
00:31:13 <Cale> Section 3.4 of the Haskell Report
00:31:15 <Pegazus> -1 means -1
00:31:25 <Cale> (+1) means \x -> x + 1
00:31:29 <Pegazus> (-)1 is a function
00:31:33 <Pegazus> (/)1 is a function
00:31:38 <Pegazus> but (/1) is a function too
00:31:39 <Pegazus> O_o
00:31:40 <Cale> (+) 1 is too
00:31:46 <Cale> yeah
00:31:52 <Pegazus> but a different function from (1/) and (/) 1
00:31:53 <Cale> I don't see what's confusing
00:31:54 <Pegazus> i mean
00:31:58 <wolverian> it's strange but useful
00:31:58 <Pegazus> - is a special case
00:32:07 <Cale> yes, - is a special case
00:32:14 <Pegazus> i don't like special cases :)
00:32:19 <Pegazus> that's why i might find it strange
00:32:20 <Cale> tough.
00:32:23 <Cale> :)
00:32:34 <wolverian> "negative numbers a special case!"
00:32:34 <Pegazus> anyway, i think that's quite confusing O_o
00:32:41 <Cale> You could change the symbol for negation.
00:32:43 * wli tries to work up the motivation to implement a CPO-STV CGI app.
00:32:50 <Cale> and separate it from minus
00:32:55 <Cale> but that's ugly too
00:32:56 <Pegazus> negation?
00:33:00 <Cale> yes
00:33:01 <Cale> -x
00:33:04 <Pegazus> mm
00:33:08 <Cale> > -5
00:33:09 <lambdabot>  -5
00:33:13 <Cale> > 1-5
00:33:14 <lambdabot>  -4
00:33:27 <Pegazus> i just think that  + and - should behave equally
00:33:28 <Cale> the - in each case is really something different
00:33:31 <Pegazus> +1 should ve the valid value 1
00:33:36 <Cale> > +1
00:33:36 <lambdabot>  Parse error
00:33:58 <Pegazus> :)
00:34:10 <Cale> The syntax requires the parens
00:34:14 <Cale> > (+1) 5
00:34:15 <lambdabot>  6
00:34:30 <Pegazus> i know
00:34:31 <Cale> think of it as an expression in which there is a gap to be filled
00:34:36 <Pegazus> i just say i don't like the syntax :)
00:34:42 <Cale> I like it
00:34:52 <Cale> It's extremely convenient
00:34:55 <Pegazus> hehe
00:35:14 <vincenz> @join #oasis
00:35:17 <vincenz> @seen itkovian
00:35:17 <lambdabot> I saw itkovian leaving #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell 11 hours, 35 minutes and 51 seconds ago, and .
00:35:22 <Cale> > filter (`elem` [2,4,6]) [2,1,6,3,2,4,1,4,6,2,3,5,3,2]
00:35:23 <lambdabot>  [2,6,2,4,4,6,2,2]
00:35:26 <vincenz> @tell itkovian Need to talk about profiling tool
00:35:27 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
00:35:38 <Cale> you could use flip
00:35:44 <Cale> but I think that's nicer
00:36:09 <Cale> It's immediately apparent what's going on
00:37:15 <Pegazus> i also hate those `
00:37:25 <Cale> > map (^2) [0..]
00:37:26 <lambdabot>  [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196,225,256,289,324,361,400,441,4...
00:37:42 <Pegazus> that may be induced because i don't have the slightest idea where ` is on my keyboard :)
00:37:56 <Cale> What kind of keyboard?
00:38:06 <Cale> It's normally in the upper left corner.
00:38:13 <Cale> Next to the 1
00:38:15 <Pegazus> i've it in altgr + some shit
00:38:27 <Cale> It's easy enough to bind.
00:38:33 <Pegazus> anyway :)
00:38:41 <Cale> hehe, I can type ∈
00:38:58 <Pegazus> if i'd to use it, i'll probably learn the ascii code
00:39:07 <Pegazus> i type difficult chars with the numpad :)
00:39:09 <normal-dude> he says his webserver is 8x as fast as apache
00:39:10 <Cale> It would be really nice to be able to write filter (∈ [2,4,6])
00:39:13 <normal-dude> and fastcgi
00:39:16 <normal-dude> !!!
00:39:18 <normal-dude> wtf!
00:39:22 <Pegazus> filter (∈ [2,4,6])?
00:39:32 <Pegazus> what the hell is that supposed to mean?
00:39:34 <normal-dude> http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=644
00:39:40 <Cale> Pegazus: I'm hoping here that you can read UTF-8 chars :)

00:56:21 <u221e> GNAA they called themselves.

00:58:02 <Cale> Yeah @topic is silly, because it relies on the topic to actually be well-formed.
00:58:14 <Cale> Rather than storing it separately.
00:58:42 <vegai> I think it'd be enough if it just remembered its own topic changes
00:58:47 <pejo> Cale, how can the topic of a channel not be well-formed?
00:59:01 <norpan> well formed as in show of [String]
00:59:02 <Cale> pejo: note that the topic is a list of strings in our case :)
00:59:02 <lilo> you can also use topiclock if it's helpful
00:59:13 <Cale> Yes, we ought to be

01:00:06 <u221e> -pgmc gcc-3.3 -optc-O3, produces completely incorrect output.
01:00:57 <norpan> what is the normal optimization level for the c compiler used by ghc then
01:01:21 <normal-dude> what does lazy pure etc mean for haskell over scheme?
01:01:40 <Cale> We sort of described that to you earlier
01:02:06 <Cale> But it's really more complicated than you could easily say in a couple of sentences
01:02:15 <u221e> [1..]
01:02:19 <Cale> The best way to find out is to just learn both languages.
01:03:55 <Cale> Learning another programming language will always tend to help your programming in any language, if only because you have another way to think about things. This is especially true of languages which have lots of distinct features from the ones you already know.
01:04:20 <norpan> that's why we all should learn intercal
01:04:25 <normal-dude> heh
01:04:30 <sieni> normal-dude: http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html
01:04:31 <lambdabot> Title: Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years
01:04:35 <Cale> Well, you should at least read the spec for it :)
01:04:35 <normal-dude> cxan a mere mortal such as me learn scheme and haskell?
01:04:39 <normal-dude> lol
01:04:46 <Cale> yes
01:04:53 <normal-dude> read the spec?
01:04:55 <pejo> normal-dude, hey - we're all mere mortals!
01:05:03 <normal-dude> isnt a spec like very low leve or something?
01:05:08 <Cale> Haskell is often taught as a first programming language to first-year university students.
01:05:13 <norpan> don't read the spec
01:05:16 <normal-dude> oh really?
01:05:17 <norpan> read a tutorial
01:05:17 <sieni> normal-dude: I learned scheme first and then haskell, and I found that to be a nice way
01:05:18 <Cale> It's really not that scary.
01:05:27 <normal-dude> hm
01:05:30 <normal-dude> ok
01:05:34 <Cale> In particular, you should read "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial"
01:05:38 <Cale> @where YAHT
01:05:38 <lambdabot> http://www.isi.edu/%7Ehdaume/htut/
01:06:19 <Cale> It's not really finished, but it'll get you started to the point where you can read other stuff :)
01:06:30 <Cale> The Haskell wikibook is also not so bad.
01:06:45 <Cale> Though I should really work on it some :)
01:06:57 <u221e> Why can't the intel shootout machine uses gcc 4 :(
01:07:11 <norpan> and here i keep saying it takes two years to learn programming, it seems that was an underestimate
01:07:21 <normal-dude> lol
01:07:33 <sieni> norpan: yes, it is
01:07:33 <normal-dude> hm
01:07:37 <Cale> It takes two years to learn Haskell, given that you know some imperative languages.
01:07:40 <normal-dude> ae haskell progammers happy?
01:07:56 <normal-dude> I know a tiny bit of bash
01:07:57 <norpan> yes very happy
01:08:00 <normal-dude> :)
01:08:03 <u221e> Me? At this moment? No
01:08:06 <vincenz> norI
01:08:08 <vincenz> nor I
01:08:16 <Cale> Well, one year to get to the point where you're comfortable, two years to actually understand a good portion of the details.
01:08:38 <Cale> I'm happy with the language
01:08:41 <dblhelix> normal-dude: never seen shapr bouncing? that's true happiness :)
01:08:42 <norpan> otoh i have been programming for 15 years now, and i still learn stuff
01:08:45 <Cale> It'd be my first choice :)
01:09:02 <vincenz> Cale: hmm... only know haskell for 6 months or so
01:09:09 <u221e> Lets see if Haskell can win the ICFP again this year ;)
01:09:13 <norpan> or even more if you count BASIC on VIC 20
01:09:15 <Cale> vincenz: you started from ML
01:09:21 <Cale> vincenz: cheater. ;)
01:09:21 <vincenz> u221e: we have a haskell team
01:09:24 <vincenz> Cale: :D
01:09:43 <u221e> I'm only been learning Haskell for the last 2 weeks or so
01:09:53 <u221e> I've
01:10:12 <Cale> The early period can be hard going if you have actual hard practical goals.
01:10:18 <normal-dude> once I kow haskell will I get rich and get the chicks?
01:10:29 <Cale> Save practical stuff for once you know the language.
01:10:35 <norpan> normal-dude: no, you will get lazy and get the pures
01:10:43 <normal-dude> pures?
01:10:55 <sieni> normal-dude: no, buy you'll know haskell which more than compensates the lack of money and chicks
01:11:20 <norpan> i have money and a chick, but i don't attribute that to learning haskell
01:11:34 <norpan> not all of it anyway
01:11:37 <norpan> part of the money
01:11:40 <Cale> Hey, there are Haskell chicks :)
01:12:23 * Cale nudges Philippa... who is probably sleeping.
01:12:49 <sieni> Cale: well... one at least
01:13:19 <vegai> programming might not be the best way to meeting 'chicks'
01:13:29 <Cale> heheh
01:14:18 <sieni> vegai: I moved from mathematics to programming...
01:14:23 <Cale> It is if you're in math.
01:14:45 <sieni> fortunately there are other ways of meeting chicks
01:14:49 <u221e> @vixen hello
01:14:49 <lambdabot> how're you?
01:14:54 <Cale> ahaha
01:15:22 <u221e> @vixen Is programming a good way to meet chicks?
01:15:22 <lambdabot> what's a program?
01:15:29 <u221e> Guess not
01:17:41 <u221e> I'm still pissed off...
01:17:59 <sieni> u221e: ?
01:18:09 <u221e> I need to do something to take my mind off the computer language shootout.
01:19:11 <sieni> u221e: drink lots of alcohol?
01:19:28 <u221e> sieni, my code gets the crap kicked out of it using gcc 3.3.5
01:19:28 <Cale> Wait, did you just say you've been learning Haskell for the past 2 weeks, and you're writing shootout entries?
01:19:37 <Cale> That's really decent progress :)
01:19:49 <u221e> Shootout entries don't use monads ;)
01:20:01 <Cale> they do IO
01:20:20 <u221e> Well yes.
01:20:31 <u221e> But IO is easy
01:20:33 <Cale> and IO is pretty much the hardest monad to understand, apart from Cont :)
01:21:07 <u221e> What about State?
01:21:17 <Cale> State is easy by comparison
01:22:12 <Cale> In IO, you have arbitrarily many mutable references via IORefs, state just has one state value that's passed around and mutated.
01:22:32 <Cale> With get and put
01:22:47 <u221e> I don't know much about IO yet. Only how to get input and print output
01:23:02 * boegel joins u221e 
01:23:10 <Cale> > evalState (do x <- get; put (x+1); y <- get; return (x,y)) 5
01:23:11 <lambdabot>  (5,6)
01:24:19 * mux needs to understand arrows
01:24:38 <mux> I get monads and monad transformers relatively well now, but arrows still beat my brain out of my head
01:25:30 <Cale> Arrows aren't as nice in the sense that if what you really have is a monad, you should use the monad interface, but they generalise monads in a useful way
01:25:53 <u221e> Cale I read your Monads as Containers article. It was very good. but...
01:26:07 <mux> yeah, that article is very nice
01:26:14 <u221e> > do x <- [10, 20, 30]; [x, x+1]
01:26:15 <Cale> The main thing that arrows do is allow you do design EDSLs where you want the thing which is executing the code to inspect bits of it on a functional level.
01:26:15 <lambdabot>  [10,11,20,21,30,31]
01:26:23 <u221e> That is weird.
01:26:31 <u221e> Even if I understand what it means
01:26:59 <mux> what seems weird to you?
01:27:02 <Cale> x takes each of the values from the list [10,20,30] in order, and then [x,x+1] are results
01:27:11 <mux> it's pretty much what I'd expect given the definition of the list monad
01:27:49 <Cale> you might think of x as getting a nondeterministic value which is all of 10, 20 and 30 at once
01:27:57 <Cale> and it's computing all possible results
01:28:06 <alar> mux: arrow combinator >>> is more simple than monad combinator >>=
01:28:09 <alar> IMHO
01:28:24 <u221e> Cale, do you have any more articles?
01:28:28 <Cale> It's simpler, but that makes it harder to use :)
01:28:32 <mux> alar: well I'm just weird then, because I can grasp >>= just fine but >>> not
01:28:42 <mux> on the other hand, I didn't devote much time on arrows yet
01:28:44 <norpan> how is >>> hard to grasp?
01:28:49 <mux> at least, not as much as for monads
01:29:11 <Cale> u221e: Introduction to IO, but you're probably past that point, you might read it anyway :)
01:29:12 <alar> Cale: yes, easy to understand the meaning, hard to understand the use of it =)
01:29:21 <u221e> @seen dons
01:29:21 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I last heard dons speak 2 hours, 52 minutes and 39 seconds ago.
01:29:45 <Cale> Monads and Arrows, in programming are both tools for getting embedded domain specific languages
01:30:17 <Cale> With monads, you have bind, (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
01:30:32 <mux> actually, I think the only thing I "know" about arrows, and that is probably very incorrect, is that they look like monads with two inputs
01:30:48 <Cale> since it takes a proper function as its right parameter, any evaluation mechanism will be unable to inspect that function ahead of time
01:30:59 <Cale> since functions are not directly observable in Haskell
01:31:04 <mux> right
01:31:15 <norpan> mux: i'd say they look like monads but with an input :)
01:31:19 <Cale> With arrows, both parameters to >>> are of the arrow type
01:31:43 <Cale> So the evaluation mechanism can perform optimisations which would be otherwise impossible.
01:31:50 <mux> that makes a lot of sense
01:32:34 <Cale> That's the main idea that the useful arrow libraries I've seen all exploit.
01:32:50 <norpan> yes, an arrow is somewhat like the second argument to >>0
01:32:53 <norpan> err >>=
01:33:05 <norpan> a monad with an input, although more general of course
01:33:11 <Cale> but abstracted to an arbitrary datatype
01:33:21 <Cale> not just plain functions
01:33:22 <norpan> exactly
01:33:26 <mux> I think I just need to sit down and read some more about arrows
01:33:31 <u221e> I wonder what the ICFP will be about this year. The image in the site sure looks interesting.
01:33:39 <mux> so that I can understand the arrows interface like the one in HXML
01:33:43 <mux> err, HXT, or whatever
01:34:00 <norpan> u221e: won't it be about functinoal programming? :)
01:34:07 <mux> which reminds me, the HXT maintainer sill hasn't answered my mail
01:34:08 * mux shrugs
01:34:33 <u221e> norpan, no, I thought it was about dressing in yellow bath robes
01:34:44 <norpan> u221e: oh, the ICFP *programming contest*
01:35:07 <u221e> Heh, sorry. I wasn't clear
01:35:09 <Cale> I really wish that Kleisli composition: f @@ g = \x -> f x >>= g  was defined in the prelude
01:35:21 <xerox> Goooooood-morning!
01:35:25 <Cale> Or at least in Control.Monad
01:35:49 <Cale> It has type: (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> a -> m c
01:36:08 <alar> u221e: informational archaeolinguistics
01:36:11 <Cale> or often you might see it being that with the parameters swapped
01:36:15 <norpan> that's >>>, right?
01:36:17 <alar> don't ask me what is it
01:36:22 <Cale> yeah, that's essentially >>>
01:36:58 <u221e> alar, hah, what!?
01:37:00 <norpan> so you want another name for >>> for the kliesli arrow
01:37:09 <Cale> well, yeah
01:37:28 <norpan> i can buy that
01:37:33 <Cale> It's a little awkward to use the Kleisli data type and wrapping, etc.
01:37:37 <norpan> not that i have ever used it
01:37:52 <norpan> otoh it's easy to define yourself
01:38:09 <Cale> It's something which ought to be hanging around for people to see.
01:38:09 <u221e> alar, there isn't even a wikipedia entry on it.
01:38:23 <Cale> Even if it would be rarely used, like ap
01:38:38 <norpan> and @@ is a standard name used for it?
01:38:51 <Cale> I don't know, I think I've seen it typed that way
01:38:53 <xerox> Can I add comments on a wikichange after have made it?
01:38:53 <norpan> never seen it
01:39:08 <norpan> otoh i work in industry
01:39:34 <Cale> yeah, I've definitely seen @@ used for it
01:39:37 <norpan> and see too little theoretical papers for my own good
01:39:48 <Cale> but normally, one just overloads \circ :)
01:39:57 <Cale> ∘ if you can see it :)
01:39:59 <xerox> http://fool.lambdabot Cale, did I show you this? `c' is really lisp's `apply', I realized this morning <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/User:PaoloMartini>
01:40:18 <norpan> Cale: i know what \circ is :)
01:40:39 <xerox> What is \circ? :)
01:40:45 <norpan> a circle
01:40:46 <xerox> The composition operator in CT?
01:40:54 <Cale> yeah
01:40:57 <norpan> it's almost any operator
01:40:58 <xerox> Cool.
01:41:09 <xerox> (Well, I'm not that advanced yet.)
01:41:16 <Cale> but almost always composition :)
01:41:32 <norpan> \circ is latex
01:41:40 <norpan> if you didn't get that
01:41:49 <xerox> (Right, because it takes arrows and return an arrow.)
01:41:52 <xerox> (Yes, I did.)
01:42:10 <norpan> (Ok)
01:42:16 <wolverian> is http://www.haskell.org/arrows/ the easiest introduction to arrows?
01:42:17 <lambdabot> Title: Arrows: A General Interface to Computation
01:42:42 <norpan> well, there are nice little boxes there
01:42:49 <Cale> probably, but it's mostly a bunch of links to other papers to read
01:42:58 <xerox> Cale - In some sense "overloading \circ" is saying "doing mathematics" :-)
01:43:01 <wolverian> oh, so it is. oh well.
01:43:04 <wolverian> thanks :)
01:43:14 <Cale> xerox: hehe
01:43:20 <xerox> wolverian: Hughes' paper is especially nice.
01:43:51 <norpan> i first found out about arrows when reading about parser combinators
01:44:05 <Cale> norpan: If you like . with functions @@ is basically the same thing, but with monadic arrows.
01:44:13 <Cale> norpan: (of course :)
01:44:22 * xerox nods
01:44:29 <Cale> So it sort of promotes compositional thinking :)
01:44:33 <norpan> swierstras and that other guys parser combinators
01:44:44 <roconnor> sort of promotes pointless thinking :)
01:44:45 <Cale> actually, I think the other order is possibly better
01:44:47 <wolverian> is -farrows used?
01:44:58 <Cale> f @@ g = \x -> g x >>= f
01:45:13 <xerox> wolverian - Yup. It enables Arrowic syntactic sugar.
01:46:26 <xerox> Cale, it depends on the order one wants to give, maybe it would be cool to have both verses: one for lone definitions, and one for bindings, where one uses =<< at times.
01:46:34 <wolverian> hrm, Hug00 isn't online I guess.
01:47:22 <norpan> Cale: it should be f @@ g = \x -> f x >>= g, right?
01:47:33 <Cale> xerox: that module looks interesting, I'll take a closer look in the morning, or more likely the afternoon :)
01:47:46 <norpan> or did i misunderstand
01:47:49 <Cale> norpan: that's the other way
01:47:59 <norpan> ah
01:48:01 <Cale> norpan: it's the same up to order of parameters
01:48:03 <norpan> you reversed order
01:48:12 <Cale> yeah, to make it more like (.)
01:48:26 <norpan> i see
01:48:47 <norpan> i need to code some c++ now, see you
01:48:52 <Cale> :)
01:49:52 <Cale> xerox: sweet :)
01:49:57 <Cale> xerox: I like it.
01:50:14 <xerox> Cale - See the comments for a fast comprehension :D
01:50:17 <xerox> Great!
01:50:26 <Cale> I'm not sure if I'll actually use it, but it's quite clever. :)
01:50:33 * xerox hops happily
01:51:15 <xerox> ihope said `d' was the right answer to the wrong question yesterday, but the question it raised was interesting enough to keep me hacking that the whole night %)
01:52:48 <shapr> whee!
01:53:26 <Cale> you could also probably do a foldr1-like thing.
01:54:06 <xerox> Cale, right. I wonder how to eliminate W's tagging, but I suppose it is not possible because we don't have type (in)equality.
01:54:15 * xerox `yow` shapr 
01:57:09 <shapr> hiya xerox!
01:59:35 <wolverian> yeah, Hughes's paper is great. now I understand arrows :)
02:04:23 <boegel> shapr: I'll ask again, still at uni?
02:06:44 <vincenz> boegel: where is andy?
02:07:11 <boegel> vincenz: should I go look for him now or something? ;p
02:07:22 <boegel> vincenz: he's hanging around I guess, but he's not at work
02:07:35 <boegel> vincenz: uni is closed this week, it's Gentse Feesten
02:08:19 <vincenz> oh
02:08:22 <vincenz> oh wait nm
02:08:29 <vincenz> I think he left for a week for vacation
02:08:34 <vincenz> or the seminar in l'aquila
02:08:44 <boegel> that's next week, I'm going to
02:08:47 <vincenz> ah
02:08:51 <boegel> vincenz: he's online right now, but not at work
02:08:53 <vincenz> well if you can get him online, that'd be great
02:09:02 <boegel> Itkovian: ping
02:09:15 <vincenz> boegel: colleagues of mine went to l'aquila last year
02:09:21 <boegel> vincenz: cool
02:10:03 <vincenz> so you get off all week?
02:12:40 <Itkovian> vincenz: I'm at home
02:12:43 <vincenz> boegel: ?
02:13:01 <boegel> vincenz: uni is closed
02:13:07 <vincenz> all week?
02:13:12 <vincenz> lucky bastards
02:14:06 <boegel> vincenz: I'm at work....
02:14:12 <vincenz> oh
02:14:14 <Itkovian> I'm putting up a fake ceiling
02:14:22 <boegel> vincenz: just because my gf has to work all day
02:25:21 <shapr> boegel: Only uni I have is unicycle!
02:26:02 <sieni> 5 clubs on a unicycle would be cool
02:26:40 <shapr> I had fun meeting some of the Stockholm unicyclists on Saturday, I hope we do that more.
02:27:56 <sieni> shapr: some juggling websites have a warning instructing a juggler not to do any unicycling, since it's too addictive and one might soon notice to have no time for juggling
02:28:26 <shapr> That seems to be true. One of the guys I met got into unicycling from juggling, and now he doesn't juggle.
02:28:50 <u221e> Heh, "Frag" actually runs.
02:28:57 <shapr> Yeah, and it's smooth too.
02:29:28 <shapr> Frag is a good demo app. I'd like to play with it more, but things get in the way.
02:29:35 <shapr> Like, I really want an apartment...
02:29:37 <u221e> Loading is pretty bad though
02:29:53 <u221e> I'm thinking o f doing something similar to learn haskell better
02:30:53 <shapr> Reactive animation is a small subset of Haskell, but if that's what you enjoy, then do it!
02:47:05 <dozer> morning
02:48:09 <Killer666> hey
02:49:05 <dozer> can someone remind me of the function that will print out run-time debug/log messages?
02:50:47 <shapr> Debug.Trace
02:50:52 <dozer> thanks
02:51:10 <shapr> I prefer unit testing though :-)
02:51:10 <vincenz> Debug.Trace.trace
02:51:21 <shapr> QuickCheck is really great.
02:51:23 <dozer> trying to debug a lazy prime seiv, and I've totaly lost track of what gets executed when
02:51:49 <vincenz> qc is not always the answer to everythng
02:51:52 <shapr> Hey, after the positive review in the History of Haskell, I'm thinking of restarting The Monad.Reader.. anyone interested in writing articles?
02:51:58 <shapr> vincenz: Are you sure? <teasing>
02:52:20 * vincenz ponders about his compiler
02:53:32 <shapr> QC is especially good for compilers.
02:53:37 <wolverian> ahh, the relational model is so nice after trying to assram this structure into OO.
03:00:24 <xerox> shapr: Maybe I could write about variadic functions!
03:02:20 <pesco> shapr: Depending on the deadline I could write about my plain-text parser.
03:07:44 <pesco> shapr: Where's that review?
03:07:47 * xerox growls
03:08:06 <pesco> xerox: Cabal troubles?
03:08:13 <xerox> pesco:
03:08:24 <pesco> xerox:
03:08:25 <xerox> ?wiki User:PaoloMartini
03:08:25 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/User:PaoloMartini
03:08:51 <xerox> I am trying to get lisp's APPLY to type-check.
03:08:52 <pesco> xerox: Oh.
03:08:55 <pesco> :)
03:09:05 <xerox> That works, but I think I can do better.
03:10:06 <xerox> But it's fun =)
03:10:38 <shapr> xerox: Yes! Or you could write about cabal-get?
03:10:53 <xerox> That too. I'm stuck, waiting for SyntaxNinja.
03:12:02 <pesco> :/
03:12:11 * pesco longs for cabal-get. Visibly.
03:12:39 <pesco> Which reminds me to answer Simon PJ...
03:12:57 <pesco> Did you guys read my post to libraries@, by any coincidence?
03:13:10 <shapr> pesco: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/History_of_Haskell
03:13:12 <lambdabot> Title: History of Haskell - HaskellWiki
03:13:20 <shapr> pesco: I read it, but I haven't had time to do much.
03:13:59 <pesco> shapr: Still being troubled by Sweden?
03:14:00 <u221e> IO a is really RealWorld -> (a, RealWorld) right?
03:14:43 <shapr> pesco: Yes, but the end is in sight, one way or the other...
03:14:49 <roconnor> u221e: only in GHC
03:15:04 <pesco> shapr: End of troubles is always good, I guess.
03:15:44 * xerox screams !!!!!!
03:15:49 <xerox> I've got it.
03:16:01 <xerox> *VarArg> unW $ c (+) (1::Int) (2::Int) :: Int
03:16:02 <xerox> 3
03:16:06 <xerox> *VarArg> unW $ c (+) (1::Int) (2::Int) (3::Int) (4::Int) :: Int
03:16:06 <xerox> 10
03:16:24 * xerox puffs and pants
03:16:35 <pesco> :)
03:16:36 <u221e> roconnor, why only in GHC?
03:17:44 <dblhelix> xerox: how does your approach relates to Oleg's solution?
03:17:50 <boegel> shapr: restarting TMR seems like a great idea :)
03:17:54 <xerox> Yes dblhelix.
03:18:32 <dblhelix> xerox: what's the difference between your approach to variadic functions and oleg's?
03:18:57 <xerox> dblhelix - The approach is the same, the functions are different.
03:22:24 <xerox> Let's QuickCheck it.
03:24:18 <xerox> *Apply Test.QuickCheck> quickCheck plus_prop
03:24:18 <xerox> Loading package QuickCheck-1.0 ... linking ... done.
03:24:18 <xerox> OK, passed 100 tests.
03:24:20 <xerox> That's it?
03:42:16 <norpan> xerox: what will happen if the arguments have different type?
03:43:03 <xerox> norpan - (+) is Num a => a -> a -> a.
03:43:33 <norpan> yes, so what will happen if the arguments have different type? :)
03:44:16 <norpan> will you get an easy to understand type error or a run-time failure
03:44:30 <xerox> None of them :-)
03:45:23 <xerox> Oh wait.
03:45:30 <xerox> You get an easy to understand type error in fact.
03:46:04 <xerox> *Apply> reify $ apply (*) 1 2 '3' :: Int
03:46:05 <xerox> Couldn't match expected type `Char' against inferred type `Int'
03:47:07 <xerox> norpan - I have updated that page with the latest code, which is very short and clean.
03:49:16 <norpan> what's the primary reason for not using a list instead?
03:50:57 <kuribas> Is there a way to use many alternatives with 'if', like 'cond' in scheme?
03:52:25 <norpan> kuribas: case?
03:52:48 <kuribas> Isn't case only used for pattern matching?
03:52:57 <norpan> you can use guards too
03:53:44 <norpan> case () of () | cond1 -> expr1 | cond2 -> expr2 ...
03:53:50 <norpan> but it's not pretty
03:53:56 <kuribas> aha
03:54:27 <norpan> i always use if then else
03:54:35 <norpan> if a then
03:54:38 <norpan>   e1
03:54:42 <norpan>  else if b then
03:54:44 <norpan>   e2
03:54:45 <norpan> ets
03:54:47 <norpan> etc
03:55:21 <kuribas> yes, that looks probably better
03:55:38 <norpan> you could make your own cond function, don't know if there is one already
03:55:52 <dibblego> is there a debian/ubuntu package for gchi?
03:55:56 <kuribas> Does getChar raise an error on EOF?
03:56:13 <norpan> cond [(cond1, expr1), (cond2, expr2)] default
03:56:51 <norpan> cond [] default = default; cond ((c,e):cs) default = if c then e else cond cs default
03:57:21 <kuribas> dibblego: I don't know about ubuntu, but ghci (I suppose that is what you meant) is part of ghc on debian.
03:57:22 <norpan> foldr ifthenelse default
03:57:23 <norpan> :)
03:57:38 <dibblego> kuribas, ok thanks
03:57:41 <kuribas> norpan: nice
03:59:47 <norpan> and due to laziness conds and exprs will be evaluated only when needed
04:00:00 <kuribas> yes
04:00:24 <kuribas> norpan: do you know what getChar returns on eof?
04:00:44 <shapr> @hoogle eof
04:00:45 <lambdabot> Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Combinator.eof :: Show tok => GenParser tok st ()
04:00:45 <lambdabot> Text.Read.EOF :: Lexeme
04:00:45 <lambdabot> System.IO.Error.eofErrorType :: IOErrorType
04:01:01 <shapr> Hm, guess not.
04:01:03 <dibblego> when I am in ghci, how do I get out of it?
04:01:07 <shapr> :q
04:01:11 <norpan> well, it can't return a Char, so I'm guessing it will be an IO error
04:01:14 <shapr> or :quit when you're feeling verbose.
04:01:22 <dibblego> ta
04:01:25 <sieni> dibblego: ctrl-d might help
04:01:56 <dibblego> ok thanks
04:03:21 <kuribas> A quick test shows that it returns an IO error.
04:03:29 <pesco> I _always_ use ctrl-d. :q is _so_ bourgoise!
04:03:39 <shapr> Isn't there another e in that word?
04:03:53 <pesco> Roight, Bourgeoise?
04:04:19 <norpan> an EOFError i would suppose
04:04:25 <shapr> Bourgeois ?
04:04:40 <norpan> bårsjoas
04:04:42 <pesco> Ah, I guess that's masculine?
04:05:11 <pesco> So I guess it's what I should have used.
04:05:21 * shapr doesn't know
04:05:36 <norpan> bourgeois
04:06:10 <norpan> capitalist
04:06:32 <pesco> Hm?
04:06:40 <sieni> not quite
04:06:42 <sieni> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie
04:07:02 * pesco propagates Haskell for the working man.
04:09:56 <xerox> norpan - I am not sure. It is surely an interesting question type-theory-wisely.

04:20:56 <u221e> Does gcc 3.3.5 have some kind of bug when using it with ghc?

04:29:38 <lambdabot> Whoa, language! :)
04:30:05 <DukeDave> and I wish for it to be a triple tuple of triple tuples
04:30:24 <shapr> @yow !
04:30:25 <lambdabot> Yow!  Now I get to think about all the BAD THINGS I did to a BOWLING
04:30:25 <lambdabot> BALL when I was in JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL!
04:30:58 <boegel> :/
04:42:40 <norpan> DukeDave: tripleit [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i] = ((a,b,c),(d,e,f),(g,h,i))
04:43:12 <DukeDave> mm, I was wondering if there was a more graceful way
04:43:27 <norpan> well, what you are trying to do is not graceful in itself, so... :)
04:43:36 <DukeDave> lol, good call
04:44:13 <norpan> normally, one avoids working with unnamed tuples
04:44:22 <DukeDave> it's really annoying, I'm generating vars to feed into a func and at some point have to dish the list out accordingly
04:44:29 <norpan> unless they are only small things

05:12:28 <vincenz> yeah
05:12:30 <vincenz> there's no $
05:13:11 <mauke> uh, ok
05:24:26 <dozer> I have tried the case option, but when I run my program I get "Non-exhaustive patterns in function filterL"  but there is an option for LT, GT and EQ

05:27:00 <dozer> sorry - meant to paste the URL
05:27:02 <dozer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/r4FQBL98.html
05:27:21 <dblhelix> dozer: what it filterL is called with an empty list as argument?
05:27:50 <dozer> ah, so it's the pattern match (dh:dt) that's the problem, not the case expression?
05:28:06 <dblhelix> dozer: just a quick guess
05:28:14 <dblhelix> dozer: btw, what are you implementing here?
05:28:21 <dozer> yup - I was being dumb
05:28:39 <dozer> I'm tinkering with a number seiv idea I had in the shower today
05:32:55 <ndm> dozer: have you read Colin Runciman's lazy wheel sieve paper?
05:33:05 <ndm> (if your seive is doing prime stuff)
05:33:08 <dozer> no - sounds like I should?
05:33:40 <ndm> dozer: if you are doing prime number seiving, then yes, definately
05:33:53 <ndm> he gives the fastest haskell algorithm for prime numbers (at least at the time)
05:34:07 <ndm> and gives other details on it - a nice read
05:37:41 <dozer> this paper sounds identical to what I had in mind
05:37:56 <dozer> gha! someone got there first (again)
05:39:02 <ndm> well at least it shows you had a good idea...
05:39:20 <dozer> always with the silver lining
05:47:15 <dozer> k - my implementation works, but is not lazy enough

05:55:23 <roconnor> this doesn't work does it?
05:55:37 <psnl> takes too long
05:56:23 <roconnor> I don't think it will produce anything under ghci either
05:56:34 <roconnor> I would expect y and z to always be 1.
05:57:25 <dozer> you should put boundaries on y,z so you only evaluate a triangle of numbers
05:57:42 <roconnor> that means there is a bug in the paper A History of Haskell
05:57:46 * roconnor goes to report it
05:58:18 <Philippa_> I'd expect ghci to produce stuff, but slowly after a while
05:58:40 <Philippa_> my expectation appears to be wrong...

06:04:34 <norpan> ghc will generate stuff, lambdabot has a time limit
06:04:45 <Philippa_> norpan: IIRC, print used to be lazier in evaluating the parameter
06:05:03 <norpan> or?
06:05:10 <Philippa_> which meant once upon a time, ghci'd start printing the list even if infinite
06:05:19 <norpan> doesn't it now?
06:05:20 <ndm> maybe line buffering is now the default?
06:05:29 <Philippa_> ndm: ah, that'd be it
06:05:32 <norpan> ah, line buffering
06:05:44 <ndm> lambdabot should turn off line buffering
06:05:52 <Philippa_> line buggering is a pain in the... uh, yeah, you get the idea
06:06:01 <roconnor> norpan: shouldn't z go upto 2*x^2?
06:06:11 <Philippa_> lambdabot doesn't work that way
06:06:17 <Philippa_> I mean, it's not printing anything

06:06:46 <dblhelix> @pl \n -> f n n

06:08:46 <greenrd> I've just built a package with cabal, and for some reason it got installed in my user package database instead of the system one, even though I didn't ask for that
06:10:29 <greenrd> Why would it do that?
06:10:46 <dblhelix> @pl \b -> g (f b) b
06:10:46 <lambdabot> g =<< f
06:10:50 <greenrd> Is it because I mistakenly let the prefix default to /usr/local?
06:10:53 <xerox> It happened to me too greenrd :(
06:11:07 <kuribas> How can I read an array using hGetArray, without having to initialize the members of the Array?
06:12:09 <dcoutts> kuribas, newArray_
06:12:13 <dcoutts> newArray_ :: Ix i => (i, i) -> m (a i e)
06:12:13 <dcoutts> Builds a new array, with every element initialised to undefined.
06:12:37 <greenrd> xerox: This is especially annoying because I'm attempting to build linux packages
06:12:46 <greenrd> so it really needs to be registered systemwide
06:13:50 <kuribas> dcoutts: That's it, thanks.
06:15:10 <kuribas> dcoutts: And I can use it inside an IO monad?
06:15:45 <dcoutts> kuribas, http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Array-MArray.html#t%3AMArray
06:15:56 <dcoutts> the MArray class is the class of mutable arrays
06:16:04 <dcoutts> it's got a monad parameter
06:16:14 <dcoutts> some instances of the class work in IO, others in ST
06:16:18 <dcoutts> see the list of instances
06:16:59 <kuribas> Ah, I understand now.
06:17:20 <dcoutts> kuribas, eg you might want IOUArray Char IO, which as you can see is an instance of MArray
06:17:46 <SamB_XP> (IOUArray is handy when you can't afford to pay in cash ;-)
06:17:52 <dcoutts> heh
06:18:12 <kuribas> I think I'll use IOUArray Word8 IO
06:19:39 <greenrd> dcoutts: Do you know why it would do that?
06:20:17 <dcoutts> greenrd, you mean register into a local db rather than global? you're not usign --user anywhere are you?
06:20:27 <dcoutts> greenrd, what Cabal version?
06:21:58 <greenrd> 1.1.4
06:22:06 <greenrd> and no, I'm not using --user, I'm even using --global
06:22:44 <SamB_XP> maybe --global accidentally does the same as --user?
06:26:13 <greenrd> doh, sorry that was due to an earlier registration, and my registration script wasn't installed
06:26:14 <greenrd> my bad
06:29:37 * dozer pings Si\\
06:37:25 <dons> u221e: around?
06:38:00 <u221e> Yes
06:39:10 <dons> any idea about why your mandelbrot appears to run slower? gcc issues?
06:39:19 <dons> (4.x causing grief?)
06:39:37 <dons> ah, it's doing better on the debian box.
06:39:52 <u221e> I really have no idea.
06:39:56 <dons> down to 1.9x C. good work
06:40:07 <dons> 4.x gcc does some weird things, I find
06:40:34 <vincenz> boegel: ping
06:40:36 <u221e> I tried compiling with 3.3.6 but it was just as fast as with 4.0.1
06:40:53 <dons> hmm. strange
06:40:54 <u221e> The Intel machine uses 3.3.5 though
06:40:58 <dons> missing flags?
06:41:15 <SamB_XP> hmm, does JHC get to play in these games yet?
06:41:38 <dons> don't think so. a lot of libraries are missing, so it'd be hard.
06:41:44 <SamB> so?
06:41:45 <ndm> I found a Win32 shootout last night, Haskell is quite far behind
06:41:48 <dons> hugs is benchmarked, but not displayed
06:41:49 <SamB> it would just fail those benchmarks
06:42:02 <ndm> unfortunately it doesn't seem to be updated
06:42:09 <dons> :/
06:42:18 <u221e> dons, think it could be the branching?
06:42:27 <SamB> ndm: heh, in typical windows fashion
06:42:38 <SamB> since windows isn't so scriptable, I mean
06:42:48 <dons> u221e: some subtle interaction with the C compiler.
06:42:49 <ndm> SamB, its perfectly easy to run a shootout on Windows
06:42:55 <dons> maybe passing -fasm would be more reliable in this case?
06:43:04 <ndm> and in fact, the memory benchmark value is much much more accurate than on Linux
06:43:05 <SamB> well, at least, you can't SSH into windows...
06:43:17 <ndm> SamB, you can, you just need to install the right stuff
06:43:26 <SamB> well, okay, so what would I need to install?
06:43:27 <u221e> dons, I tired it with -fasm... the performance isn't very good.
06:43:35 <dons> SamB: install linux, run it in vmware ;)
06:43:50 <ndm> SamB, I can't remember, but I did it a long time ago in the past
06:44:03 <SamB> dons: that doesn't work
06:44:12 <SamB> you still can't run commands on the windows machine that way
06:44:14 <vincenz> boegel: ping
06:44:17 <SamB> I mean, sure, same hardware
06:44:43 <SamB> but that isn't the point -- the point is to run them on the windows *system*
06:44:46 <dcoutts> SamB, you can get ssh for windows, it ssh's you into a commad.exe shell
06:44:58 <SamB> do you have to pay for this?
06:45:04 <dcoutts> don't think so
06:45:05 <eivuokko> Or you can use terminal services.
06:45:05 <SamB> or is there actually a free sshd?
06:45:12 <SamB> eivuokko: how do you do that?
06:45:16 <u221e> While experimenting though I found that using -pgmc gcc-3.3 -optc-O3 cuased completly incorrect output
06:45:36 <eivuokko> SamB, if you have w2k or newer, read windows help for terminal services and remote desktop.
06:45:38 <SamB> that wouldn't work too well if is for GUI stuff
06:45:51 <SamB> (only)
06:45:54 <ndm> SamB, remote desktop also does it, for GUI stuff
06:45:59 <dons> u221e: i've found -optc-O3 segfault our programs before
06:46:11 <dons> ghc generates corner-case code for gcc, and they don't use QuickCheck
06:46:36 <ndm> why hasn't anyone written a C compiler in Haskell yet? that would be the ultimate
06:46:43 <SamB> I mean, you don't want to use graphical scripts for a shootout
06:47:11 <SamB> I dunno
06:47:17 <ndm> SamB, there is an sshd equivalent, but no idea what it is
06:47:20 <SamB> 'cause Language.C isn't done yet?
06:47:24 <SamB> or is it now?
06:47:25 <ndm> a GUI shootout would be interesting
06:47:34 <SamB> eh
06:47:40 <SamB> I think it would be apples and oranges
06:47:45 <ndm> weren't they only doign a parser in Language.C
06:47:55 <xerox> SamB: there's a whole bunch of code on darcs.h.o/soc/language.c/
06:47:55 <eivuokko> There isn't good modular backends either written in haskell, is there?
06:47:58 <u221e> dons, do you know the specifics of the CPU that they are running? Is it one of the earlier ones?
06:48:02 <SamB> plus the entries would most likely all be "fast enough"
06:48:17 <ndm> eivuokko: how do you mean by Modular?
06:48:18 <dons> u221e: not sure. could we try maybe -march=pentium4 ?
06:48:31 <dons> (not sure if that's legal, but seems plausible)
06:48:32 <SamB> xerox: uh huh, I heard about that SoC project
06:48:47 <eivuokko> ndm, written as separate package/library instead as part of existing compiler.
06:48:51 <SamB> I am sure someone will write a C compiler in the next year or so
06:49:20 <ndm> eivuokko: Yhc and GHC both spit out Core, thats close
06:49:31 <eivuokko> ndm, Backend?
06:49:54 <ndm> eivuokko: the Yhc compiler backend is pretty well detatched - we have Haskell Byte Code and .NET bytecode already
06:50:00 <ndm> and a separate Yhc.ByteCode API
06:50:02 <u221e> dons, I'm wondering because maybe the branches are causing the P4s huge 31 stage pipeline to keep dumping.
06:50:08 <SamB> hmm, apparantly there is now an mtune flag?
06:50:18 <eivuokko> ndm, No offense, but bytecode is very diffrent from native code.
06:50:20 <dons> it may very well be something like that, u221e.
06:50:28 <SamB> oh, but it is the new name for -mcpu
06:50:31 <ndm> eivuokko: i am well aware of that :)
06:50:40 <eivuokko> ndm, And both backends are totally unsuitable for use for non-functional languages.
06:50:49 <SamB> -march=pentium4 is apparantly allowed in 4.0
06:50:59 <dons> yeah, works nicely SamB :)
06:51:02 <ndm> GHC uses Cmm backend, so that is pretty detatched
06:51:06 <dons> you can get significant speedups too
06:51:27 <SamB> as is -march=prescott
06:51:48 <SamB> and -march=nocana
06:52:14 <SamB> sadly none of these will do me any good, because I have no P4 at all
06:52:25 <eivuokko> ndm, As far as I know the cmm support if veryvery limited in ghc.  In practice it requires using ghc-register saving techique and doesn't support non-tail calls or continuations/unwinding.
06:52:48 <ndm> eivuokko: but it is intended to the future
06:52:49 <SamB> btw, is it true that Pentium Mobile chips are still based on the P6 microarchitecture?
06:52:55 <eivuokko> ndm, The cmm-compiler in ghc also has lots of ghc-structure specific stuff.
06:53:11 <eivuokko> Like reading infotables etc via almost-builtin syntax.
06:53:22 <ndm> I haven't looked that close, but the plan is that one day it will be a library - i think
06:53:41 <SamB> wait, how can it not support non-tail calls?
06:54:04 <SamB> what happens if you call from a non-tail position?
06:54:09 <eivuokko> SamB, ghc only jumps, except when doing foreign calls.
06:54:42 <eivuokko> It doesn't use cmm stack for that.
06:54:49 <eivuokko> It uses ghc's stack.
06:54:56 <SamB> oh, that
06:55:04 <eivuokko> ghc rts + cmm backend in ghc are very tighly integrated.
06:55:06 <SamB> I didn't think its Cmm had a stack
06:55:11 <eivuokko> It has.
06:55:15 <eivuokko> (in spec)
06:55:50 <SamB> what I want to know is how GHC tosses the C stack ;-)
06:55:50 <eivuokko> It is very important that it has stack and some closure format for continuations in stack.
06:56:01 <Philippa_> SamB: the Pentium Ms are significantly different
06:56:31 <eivuokko> SamB, What do you mean?
06:57:02 <SamB> okay, so maybe I don't actually need to ask that question...
06:57:48 <eivuokko> In general, it only uses c-stack for foreign c-calls.
06:58:14 <SamB> yeah, I know...
07:01:04 <SamB> hmm, I wish the evil mangler properly identified instructions/data in its output...
07:01:42 <SamB> hmm, I know I hacked it to do that locally once
07:01:43 <eivuokko> Properly and evil mangler in one sentence seems off place ;)
07:01:48 <SamB> well...
07:02:04 <ndm> maybe what the evil mangler needs is killing...
07:02:38 <norpan> yes, the evil mangler needs to die
07:02:44 <SamB> basically it doesn't pass through some things from GCC's output that it probably ought to, I think
07:03:19 <eivuokko> What we need is good cmm backend.  Altho I'd like ANF-based spec with features of cmm instead of cmm now that dons convinced me...
07:03:39 <SamB> yeah, it is totally not the real C--
07:04:12 <eivuokko> Actually, simple cmm backend with good structure would be better.  I sure could use one.
07:04:12 <vincenz> eivuokko: yeah, ANF is nice
07:04:14 <shapr`> ANF?
07:04:20 <vincenz> administrative normal form
07:04:22 <eivuokko> Administrative normal form.
07:04:31 <shapr> Do I have to do paperwork to use that?
07:04:32 <vincenz> I got into it after reading a paper by chakvarty
07:04:44 <vincenz> I plan to use it in my compiler in fact
07:04:53 <vincenz> eivuokko: you know a lot about ANF?
07:04:55 <SamB> oh, wait, you were saying you want a simpler language instead of C-- ?
07:04:58 <vincenz> I did have some technical questions
07:05:09 <vincenz> SamB: ANF and SSA are isomorphic
07:05:13 <eivuokko> vincenz, Not a lot.  I'm not a compiler guy in general, I was just fooling around lately.
07:05:16 <vincenz> and C-- is most likely SSA
07:05:27 <SamB> vincenz: is it now?
07:05:37 <vincenz> yes
07:05:58 <vincenz> all you need to represent C-- is if/then/else, functions, basic blocks and gotos
07:06:06 <vincenz> and afaik SSA can always be done
07:06:21 <vincenz> so ANF should be feasible for any code that can be represented by c--
07:06:32 <eivuokko> Yeah
07:06:34 <vincenz> though ANF is very nice cause it's lexically scoped, and you don't need phi functions
07:06:41 <eivuokko> :)
07:06:42 <SamB> can't you do SSA for anything?
07:06:44 <vincenz> so the CFG is as good as implicit
07:07:06 <shapr> Yup, any mutable code can be represented in SSA form.
07:07:08 <vincenz> my question regarding doing alias analysis and post-anf ssafication
07:07:20 <shapr> vincenz: Which paper? I want to mention it on my blog!
07:07:31 <vincenz> shapr: you gotta have an account wth elsevier
07:07:40 <shapr> urk
07:07:41 <vincenz> shapr: and I doubt you can publicize it
07:07:44 <shapr> gragh
07:08:03 <shapr> Still, chak has almost all of his papers online... maybe it's there?
07:08:10 <vincenz> eivuokko: basically... I have ml-style references... I figured I would do ANFication, and AFTER detect the function calls to "new" and "modify" and "read" to these references and flatten the anf and do alias analysis... think this is feasible?
07:08:15 <vincenz> shapr: no
07:08:19 <shapr> Aww :-(
07:08:22 <SamB> hmm
07:08:24 <eivuokko> shapr, vincenz, this one: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CKZ03.html ?
07:08:24 <lambdabot> Title: Research Papers of Manuel Chakravarty

07:08:36 <vincenz> yeah it's CKZ03
07:08:55 <vincenz> right, can't download it, I had it right after all, you confused me there for an instant
07:08:58 <eivuokko> There is another interesting paper from him that has anf as sort of "secure" language.
07:09:04 <shapr> vincenz: I don't think that would ruin their business.
07:09:06 <vincenz> anyways it refers to another paper that actually describes ANF
07:09:17 <shapr> It might cut their profit margin down from the 30 to 40 percent that it is now...
07:09:18 <vincenz> which is from some guy working with scheme
07:09:34 <vincenz> shapr: I'm gonna publish a book soon as well, we have to sign forms that we don't distribute in other ways
07:09:43 <SamB> they are too stupid to know the difference, maybe?
07:10:01 <shapr> vincenz: That's insane.. why not use lulu.com instead?
07:10:13 <vincenz> ?
07:10:25 <shapr> lulu.com is cafepress for books.
07:10:40 <vincenz> because they don't just publish they take care of other stuff as well, for instance promoting at conferences and what not
07:10:45 <vincenz> it's the way things are done in academia
07:10:48 <vincenz> kluwers...elsevier...
07:10:48 <vincenz> etc
07:10:55 <shapr> I think that particular part of academia is broken.
07:10:55 <vincenz> anyways, back to the technical
07:10:58 <vincenz> eivuokko: any ideas?
07:12:00 <vincenz> dons: or you?
07:12:05 <vincenz> dons: you prolly know about ANF as wel
07:12:06 <eivuokko> vincenz, Not really.
07:14:07 <shapr> eivuokko: Do you have a website?
07:14:42 <eivuokko> shapr, tamelambda.net  but it's pretty empty...
07:15:05 <shapr> vincenz: What's your new site?
07:15:21 * shapr can only remember the oasis at the moment.
07:15:56 <vincenz> shapr: http://notvincenz.comc
07:16:00 <vincenz> but I don't publish work stuff on there
07:16:03 <vincenz> except links to my published papers
07:16:22 <vincenz> without the final c
07:20:06 <dozer> Si\, I'm unable to botch haifa-lite to compile under ghc 6.5
07:29:40 <shapr> hiya jmuk!
07:30:05 <jmuk> hello
07:30:09 <shapr> jmuk: I've been watching the HaskellNet repo. I haven't yet tried the IMAP library, but I'll soon have time.
07:30:22 <shapr> jmuk: Has google been good to you?
07:31:49 <roconnor> @what hunit
07:31:49 <lambdabot> http://hunit.sourceforge.net/
07:31:51 <shapr> Konichiwa jun-san
07:31:58 <shapr> jmuk: Is that correct?
07:33:11 <sieni> http://www.teikko.fi/moido/
07:33:14 <lambdabot> Title: MOIDO
07:34:06 <shapr> Oh, he liked sake. I like this guy already.
07:34:16 * Lemmih is a little disappointed that AngloHaskell hasn't drawn more definite attendees.
07:34:41 <shapr> Lemmih: Maybe we need to contact some of the UK folks directly?
07:34:45 <shapr> I can send some emails...
07:34:49 * shapr thinks...
07:35:06 <xerox> I think it might work for me
07:35:16 <Philippa_> Lemmih: it's a little hard to get definites without an exact date for it
07:35:29 <xerox> <Interrupted by Philippa>
07:35:36 <shapr> dcoutts: ping? Happen to know which Haskell-using universities are somewhere near Cambridge? For example, I could send emails to GM Hutton, Paul Hudak, etc, if they're nearby.
07:35:47 <shapr> Philippa_: True that...
07:35:55 <Lemmih> Philippa_: Right.
07:36:01 <dcoutts> shapr, Oxford teach Haskell to first years
07:36:06 <shapr> Lemmih: I've got my references organized, maybe we should talk about which date is good?
07:36:08 <tony2> Imperial also.
07:36:16 <dcoutts> shapr, or there's York on Nottingham or Canteburry(?)
07:36:30 <Philippa_> reading earlier: SSI is nice, GRIN seems to be pretty much equivalent to it
07:36:35 <shapr> Right, and Imperial has Arnia and Paul Callaghan
07:36:41 <Lemmih> shapr: I've been thinking something like the 1st to the 4th.
07:36:50 <Philippa_> nottingham's just about in day-trip distance
07:36:55 <shapr> Lemmih: sounds good to me
07:37:07 <Philippa_> so yeah, contact someone like gmh and suggest they forward it
07:37:08 <shapr> Lemmih: We could do AngloHaskell on 4 & 5 maybe?
07:37:32 <shapr> 4 evening we could do a pub, and 5 daytime we could code and/or discuss?
07:37:43 <dcoutts> 4th & 5th of Aug?
07:37:45 <Philippa_> sounds good
07:37:49 <dcoutts> that's Friday & Saturday
07:38:03 <Philippa_> yeah. Which avoids the trains-are-shit-on-sundays thing
07:38:07 <dcoutts> heh
07:38:28 <tony2> In Cambridge, is this because you are all applying for GHC job?
07:38:31 <dcoutts> London <-> Cambridge is pretty good, even on a Sunday
07:38:33 <shapr> tony2: yup
07:38:37 <Philippa_> on the downside, Rosie's booked up at weekends but I could find out if she's free earlier on the fourth or on the third (or just see her another time)
07:38:47 <dcoutts> and other people just want to meet up :-)
07:38:55 <Philippa_> Cambridge<->Nottingham is messy, I end up having to go via leicester
07:39:03 <shapr> Yeah, if a bunch of Haskellers are showing up near some others, why not get together and chat?
07:39:09 <shapr> It worked well for EuroHaskell.
07:39:18 <Lemmih> Great. I'll update the wiki and send a notice to the mailing-list.
07:39:26 <shapr> Lemmih: wait!
07:39:27 <dcoutts> shapr, we should arrange to play unicycle hockey with the Cambridge Community Circus folk, my sister's a member
07:39:32 <Philippa_> you know your interviews're close enough to it?
07:39:34 <shapr> Lemmih: We need to hear from MSR if that's a good date :-)
07:39:41 <shapr> dcoutts: Oh yeah!
07:39:46 <dcoutts> ever played?
07:39:51 <dcoutts> it's great fun :-)
07:39:57 <shapr> dcoutts: Did you see the photos of the Saturday unimeet? First time I met other unicyclists.
07:40:06 <dcoutts> no, I didn't see
07:40:15 <dcoutts> url?
07:40:20 <shapr> Nah, I've been a lone uniguy until two days ago.
07:40:54 <tony2> can you use parsec with bytestrings?
07:40:54 <shapr> dcoutts: http://enhjulingsfolket.se/viewtopic.php?pid=14273#p14273
07:40:57 <lambdabot> Title: Enhjulingsfolket / Stockholms rull p lrdag 15 juli - Ngon hemma?
07:41:04 <dcoutts> tony2, not yet
07:41:13 <shapr> Parsec on bytestrings would rock.
07:41:33 <dcoutts> but it can't be that hard, ByteStrings provide an inductive view just like [Char]
07:41:43 <tony2> hmm, is that being worked on?
07:42:12 <dcoutts> shapr, hah, nice pics :-)
07:42:17 <sjanssen> shapr: I'm porting Parsec to ByteStrings as part of my SoC project
07:42:29 * dcoutts grins
07:42:33 <tony2> (I hope you other UK'ers are in the Garden also it's such a lovely day)
07:42:42 <shapr> sjanssen: cool!
07:42:43 <tony2> sjanssen, your doing lots of usefull things for me!!!
07:42:52 <shapr> dcoutts: In the third pic, auno is playing with my Nokia 770
07:42:59 <dcoutts> shapr, :-)
07:43:20 <dcoutts> shapr, I can't decide if I should get one of those or a dual core amd64 :-)
07:43:32 <xerox> eivuokko: maybe you can add 'MonadState AsmState' to the deriving clause of the newtype definition of Asm.
07:43:56 <dcoutts> sjanssen, how's that going btw?
07:43:59 <shapr> dcoutts: Up until recently I would have said dualcore amd64! But now I'd have a hard time choosing. This little critter is *way* useful.
07:44:12 <dcoutts> so what do you use it for?
07:44:25 <dcoutts> can it share/sync info with evolution on the desktop?
07:44:29 <roconnor> @hoogle unsagePerformIO
07:44:29 <lambdabot> No matches found
07:44:36 <shapr> Maemo-mapper syncs to google maps, gpe-calendar reads google calendar, it does imap-ssl
07:44:50 <sjanssen> roconnor: yeah, I think that's a typo
07:44:55 <vincenz> eivuokko: ping
07:45:00 <Lemmih> shapr: The interviewees will have to be in Cambridge before AngloHaskell, right? Maybe we should make a schema of when we are available, and then try to coordinate with MSR.
07:45:05 <vincenz> @seen itkovian
07:45:06 <lambdabot> I saw itkovian leaving #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell 5 hours, 5 minutes and 7 seconds ago, and .
07:45:22 <vincenz> Lemmih: anglohaskell sounds interesting
07:45:26 <vincenz> Lemmih: it's GB only?
07:45:28 <sjanssen> dcoutts: haven't actually started on the Parsec stuff yet.  However, like you said, it won't be hard
07:46:10 <dcoutts> sjanssen, yeah, assuming Parsec never rebuilds strings
07:46:10 <Lemmih> vincenz: Yep. http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/AngloHaskell
07:46:11 <lambdabot> Title: AngloHaskell - HaskellWiki
07:46:28 <dcoutts> we should add a ByteStrign wrapper to alex too
07:47:05 <vincenz> anyone got a blogger on blogspot?
07:47:13 <vincenz> I don't know how to get the admin menu
07:47:16 <vincenz> Lemmih: pity :
07:47:17 <vincenz> :/
07:47:39 <vincenz> Lemmih: oh I had already seen the site from haskell-cafe
07:47:55 <vincenz> Lemmih: when is the meeting?
07:48:02 <roconnor> @what fruit
07:48:02 <lambdabot> I know nothing about fruit.
07:48:15 <vincenz> Lemmih: and what time...cause if I cacme I'd prolly have to travel back and forth
07:48:21 * vincenz doesnt want to spend money for a hotel
07:48:25 <vincenz> unless someone has a place I can crash
07:49:29 <Philippa_> there's one definite and one potential offer of crashspace on the wiki page
07:50:01 <vincenz> ok
07:50:03 <vincenz> sorry
07:50:09 <vincenz> slept only 5 hours after 30 hour day
07:50:12 <vincenz> my reading capabilities are reduced
07:50:16 <Philippa_> 'sok
07:50:16 <vincenz> anyways I think attending would be neat
07:50:18 <Lemmih> vincenz: We think it'll be on the 4th and 5th of August.
07:50:28 <vincenz> that a weekend?
07:50:40 <ndm> Lemmih: overnight on the 5th as well?
07:50:54 <vincenz> how does one get to cambridge?
07:51:13 <ndm> I have a wedding on the 4th, but can come down for the 5th if its going to be an all day and night thing
07:51:40 <Philippa_> ndm: you too? The friend I might otherwise be meeting up with's at one too
07:51:56 <vincenz> Lemmih: which station should I stop at?
07:51:59 <ndm> Philippa_: yeah, everyones getting married now...
07:52:01 <vincenz> there's two stations in cambridge
07:52:05 <alar> what is "newtype" mainly used for? negation of standard instances?
07:52:08 <Lemmih> vincenz: We don't know yet.
07:52:12 <vincenz> cambridge heath or cambridge bus station?
07:52:27 <Lemmih> We're discussing in #AngloHaskell. Feel free to join.
07:52:34 <Philippa_> there's only one rail station called "cambridge"
07:53:05 <vincenz> I get two on www.nmbs.be
07:53:16 <vincenz> woot
07:53:23 <vincenz> travel time of only 4 hours by train
07:53:32 <Philippa_> cool, it's two and a half from where I am
07:53:47 <vincenz> I'd have to know when exactly tho
07:53:52 <vincenz> cause I'd have to reserve for EUROSTAR
07:54:04 * vincenz hopes it's not excessive in cost, I just spent a shitload of money in toronto
07:54:20 <psnl> yeah
07:54:27 <vincenz> like 100 euro/day
07:54:32 <shapr> yikes
07:54:34 <vincenz> I'm getting it partially reimbursed but still
07:54:41 <vincenz> and that's nont including hotel costs
07:54:45 <vincenz> (though I get those back cocmpletely)
07:54:58 <tony2> I'm holidaying then, otherwise I'd come.
07:55:32 <vincenz> Lemmih: hopefully you can get some more details on hours and such soon :)
07:57:08 <tony2> Is the GHC job for working on a particular bit of it, or bugfixing, or more general?
07:57:16 <shapr> Sort of like general GHC janitor
07:57:28 <shapr> The simons are doing the heavy brain work, they need a hi-tech gopher...
07:57:53 <shapr> More like: Should the Simons be spending their time debugging SMP STM, or approving/rejecting mailing list posts?
07:57:56 <vincenz> psnl: got wifi?
07:58:06 <tony2> Cool, a little load relief for them,,,
07:58:34 <vincenz> tony2: I don't think the anglohaskell meeting is for job interviews
07:58:35 <psnl> vincenz: where?
07:58:41 <vincenz> psnl: at the place you offer to crash at
07:58:41 <vincenz> :D
07:58:45 <psnl> no
07:58:57 <edwinb> A weekend without wifi is good for the soul :)
07:59:05 <vincenz> true nuff
07:59:23 <vincenz> suggestion to the organizers: find some restaurant once you get better details and reserve
07:59:36 <edwinb> If it's going to be that weekend, I think I will definitely be able to make it
07:59:39 <shapr> The Simons also want someone who can keep up with all the trivia that's hard to discover but easy to remember.
07:59:43 <psnl> we have orginizers?
07:59:44 <vincenz> yeah the weekend is good for me too
07:59:52 <ndm> vincenz: or walk into any pizza hut and get unlimited pizza for about £5 :)
07:59:53 <vincenz> psnl: unofficially at least
08:00:04 <edwinb> There's nice pub food in Cambridge ;)
08:00:10 <shapr> psnl: For AngloHaskell?
08:00:18 <psnl> fine for me, though I am going to a friend's party on the 5th
08:00:18 <shapr> Organizers are Lemmih and me.
08:00:25 <psnl> shapr: cool
08:01:43 <shapr> vincenz: AngloHaskell really is happening because people got invited for interviews, so we figured we'd try to get more people to show up near the interview dates for chat & code.
08:01:59 <kosmikus> so, you and Lemmih got invited?
08:02:42 <vincenz> shapr: yeah I know :)
08:03:02 <shapr> There were a total of three interviewees that I know of, Lemmih and I are two of them. I dunno if the third person wants to advertise their invitation :-)
08:03:08 <ailndx> anglohaskell?
08:03:18 <xerox> ?wiki AngloHaskell
08:03:18 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/AngloHaskell
08:03:26 <kosmikus> shapr: ah :) whatever ...
08:03:46 <xerox> You got the question right, modulo 7-humming-distance.
08:04:13 <shapr> ailndx: Will you be in or near Cambridge during those days?
08:04:37 <shapr> ailndx: r du svensk? Kanske i Stockholm ven?
08:06:18 <shapr> I'm looking for Haskellers in Stockholm, I want to organize a regular meeting to discuss type theory, etc.
08:12:10 <sjanssen> @hoogle touchForeignPtr
08:12:10 <lambdabot> Foreign.ForeignPtr.touchForeignPtr :: ForeignPtr a -> IO ()
08:13:10 <lispy> what does it mean to touch a pointer?
08:13:27 <xerox> Pain!
08:13:53 <lispy> ;)
08:13:55 <alar> what extensions allow nontermination of typechecker?
08:14:14 <sjanssen> lispy: touchForeignPtr tells the garbage collector not to collect that ForeignPtr yet
08:15:05 <norpan> conceptually it just keeps a copy of the pointer until it's evaluated, right?
08:15:10 <lispy> sjanssen: why would the GC need a hint like that?  shouldn't it be able to look at when the pointer is reachable?
08:15:25 <norpan> lispy: it's used together with unsafePerformIO
08:15:54 <lispy> xerox is right :)
08:16:02 * xerox boings
08:16:18 <sjanssen> lispy: touchForeignPtr is an artificial dependency that keeps the pointer reachable
08:17:08 <dcoutts> lispy, it's actually for when you take a raw Ptr out of a ForeignPtr
08:17:39 <norpan> err, that was what I meant
08:17:52 <dcoutts> lispy, the GC can fully accurately track ForeignPtrs, but it can't track Ptrs they're more primitive
08:18:10 <vincenz> eivuokko: any idea why ANF is not used more often in functional community?
08:18:45 <norpan> vincenz: because i don't know what ANF is?
08:18:53 <dcoutts> so when you extract the Ptr from a ForeignPtr then we need to make sure the ForeignPtr remains live for the duration of the use of the Ptr. (Since otherwise it may be the last use of the ForengnPtr and the GC may find that it can discard it)
08:19:08 <vincenz> @tell dons Why is ANF not more commonly used?  In addition, if one has ML-style references, is it possible to make a first ANF whichc regards the access/creation/update functions of the references to be just functions and only then does alias analysis and flattens more so it's truly SSA?
08:19:08 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
08:19:28 <vincenz> norpan: and you're the definite authority of the fpl community?
08:19:33 <norpan> hardly :)
08:19:47 <Lemmih> vincenz: (re-anglohaskell) How will the 4th and 5th of August suit you?
08:19:49 <norpan> i don't think there is an authority telling people what to use actually :)
08:19:53 <dcoutts> ANF? applicative normal form ?
08:19:58 <vincenz> administrative
08:20:03 <vincenz> or wait... is it applicative?
08:20:08 * dcoutts has no idea
08:20:09 <vincenz> no
08:20:12 <vincenz> administrative
08:20:14 <vincenz> had to double check
08:20:22 <vincenz> @google CKz03

08:20:42 <vincenz> there we go
08:20:48 <vincenz> it's elsevier tho..
08:21:04 * vincenz is planning to use ANF in his compiler
08:21:12 * lispy frowns on elsevier
08:22:06 <vincenz> got a nice overview paper :)

08:22:47 <lambdabot> Title: Knuth: Open Letter to Condolezza Rice
08:23:07 <lispy> i never knew knuth wrote to politicians :)
08:23:44 <vincenz> kik
08:23:45 <vincenz> lol
08:24:00 <Philippa_> I'm not impressed by the mis-spelling of her name though
08:24:20 <vincenz> Philippa_: "condi" ?
08:24:34 <Philippa_> vincenz: in the page title
08:24:37 <vincenz> yeah
08:24:38 <lispy> this is the link i was looking for: http://theoryofcomputing.org/crisis.html
08:24:40 <vincenz> I thought it was with a G
08:24:51 <Philippa_> I'm talking about the "lezza" part
08:24:57 <vincenz> oh
08:24:59 <vincenz> 1 z
08:25:03 <ihope> So what Haskell datatype is used for bitmaps?
08:25:05 <Philippa_> two es
08:25:08 <vincenz> o.O
08:25:16 <vincenz> goes to show how much I care about US politics
08:25:27 <vincenz> and anything remotely affiliated with it
08:25:49 <Philippa_> It's more the homophobic slur part, although in Knuth's case I imagine (and hope!) it's accidental
08:26:12 <vincenz> ?
08:26:25 <vincenz> what homophobic slur part
08:26:25 <ihope> Or should I just make my own using all this fancy unboxed stuff?
08:27:26 <vincenz> Philippa_: gotta admit that I find it a rather ... unformal email
08:27:29 <sjanssen> ihope: UArray of Bool is a packed bit array, but there are certain problems with it
08:27:40 <Philippa_> vincenz: "lezza" as in "lesbian"
08:27:43 <edwinb> I was assuming from the tone that he'd known her personally at some stage
08:27:49 <vincenz> oh
08:27:52 <vincenz> prolly typo
08:27:52 <Philippa_> the mis-spelling's common amongst her opponents
08:27:56 <lispy> ihope: when using opengl i have this definition:data Image = Image Size (PixelData Word8)
08:28:05 <Philippa_> including some left-wing people who should know better
08:28:22 <vincenz> funny that leftwingers would use that as an attack
08:28:30 <vincenz> I would think they're pro plurisexuality
08:28:30 <alar> "leeza" can stand for "lesbian" if read by russian-speaker ;)
08:28:38 * roconnor wants to use HUnit
08:28:50 <Philippa_> vincenz: yeah, but "gay" still means "bad", right? :-(
08:28:55 <sjanssen> Philippa_: is the misspelling really common?  Don't think I've ever heard it
08:28:56 <vincenz> Philippa_: not in my world
08:29:11 <Philippa_> vincenz: not to me, but it's extremely common among US and UK kids
08:29:20 <vincenz> oh yeah "that's so gay"
08:29:23 <ndm> when people call someone gay, it isn't usually a compliment
08:29:28 <lispy> yeah, "ghey" as they claim
08:29:36 <vincenz> we actually have a separate word for the negative aspect
08:29:38 <vincenz> which is "queer"
08:29:42 <Philippa_> sjanssen: it's pretty common when you look at comments and forum posts rather than just articles, yeah
08:29:50 <ndm> we have plenty of words for the negative aspect
08:29:57 <Philippa_> vincenz: I think we've had that argument too. Queer means something different
08:30:02 <vincenz> Philippa_: welll I would hardly call 15-year old speech usage an example of demographic ideologies
08:30:06 <ndm> and relatively few for just the literal fact
08:30:10 <Philippa_> hell, there's an entire academic field called queer theory
08:30:12 <norpan> hey
08:30:27 <Philippa_> vincenz: it's not exactly uncommon amongst 20-somethings either, and I've seen it from people older than that
08:30:33 <vincenz> anyways... I found the email by knuth surprising unformal and short
08:30:43 <vincenz> Philippa_: I guess education goes a long way...
08:30:44 * lispy wonders  if we've crossed he line to #haskell-blah at this point
08:31:00 <Philippa_> it's common enough that people're regularly told they shouldn't be offended by it "because it just means bad now, it's not about gay people" (because the usage didn't arise that way, oh no)
08:31:09 <Philippa_> probably
08:31:30 <ndm> but why fight it - its things like the spastics society is now called scope
08:31:35 <Philippa_> and we've had this discussion before, and give or take a few details I'm pretty sure everyone here's on the same side anyway, so shall we save the time?
08:31:38 <vincenz> Philippa_: well there are similar words.... like "k*ke" etc..
08:31:41 <tony2> Gay used to mean happy right?
08:31:49 <dcoutts> aye
08:31:58 <vincenz> tony2: yes, I think it comes from the french "gai" (iirc the spelling correctly)
08:32:04 <vincenz> s/correctly//
08:32:07 <dcoutts> still does in some contexts
08:32:22 <tony2> as in gayety.
08:32:41 <Philippa_> ndm: because spastic still also means what it used to. Because if we keep surrendering labels to homophobic arseholes then we never get equality.
08:32:49 <lispy> ihope: in fact you can read how i use that data definition: http://projects.codersbase.com/repos/nehe-tuts/Util.hs
08:32:54 <vincenz> tony2: or "you look gay today"
08:33:17 <roconnor> Should I write my HUnit tests in a new module?
08:33:19 <Philippa_> tony2: it was even used with that meaning on Dr Who a few eps back
08:33:29 <Philippa_> and not by an "odd" or "naive" character, either
08:33:47 <tony2> Cool, I'm in "bad wolf bay" right now!
08:33:57 <alar> Philippa: you'll never get equality anyway, until homosexuals invent their way of having children
08:34:17 <vincenz> Philippa_: on the other hand I also don't agree with the PCattitude in the US
08:34:22 * lispy points at #haskell-blah again
08:34:23 <vincenz> where anything you might say is directly offensive
08:34:25 <vincenz> you need sarcasm
08:34:36 <vincenz> but lispy's got a point
08:34:57 <mnislaih> hi every!
08:35:01 <mnislaih> @seen Lemmih
08:35:01 <lambdabot> Lemmih is in #oasis, #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I last heard Lemmih speak 15 minutes and 14 seconds ago.
08:35:06 <Philippa_> alar: do us a favour and don't wilfully misinterpret the terminology years after everyone's done that argument to death?
08:35:07 <mnislaih> Lemmih: hi ?
08:35:26 <Lemmih> mnislaih: Hey?
08:35:29 <shapr> Oj, take the sexuality discussion to #haskell-blah
08:35:51 <mnislaih> Lemmih: I am having more problems with breakpoints. Do you have time to talk about it ?
08:36:18 <dmhouse> shapr: 'Oj' looks very weird to someone whose language includes a hard 'j'.
08:36:18 <lambdabot> dmhouse: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
08:36:26 <shapr> dmhouse: oh right..
08:36:35 <shapr> dmhouse: Hey, I'm from Alabama, I just live in Sweden...
08:36:50 <dmhouse> I'd pronounce 'Oj' like 'Odge'.
08:37:12 <Lemmih> mnislaih: I will in 10 minutes or so.
08:37:21 <vincenz> shapr: "Green Bow Aylaybayma?
08:37:38 <shapr> Selma, actually. But I grew up in Birmingham.
08:38:15 <mnislaih> Lemmih: ok, pm me
08:38:24 <dmhouse> Birmingham? Wow, that's about fourty minutes' drive away from me.
08:38:35 <dmhouse> *forty. Stupid inconsistent English.
08:39:00 <shapr> dmhouse: Where are ya?
08:39:15 <dmhouse> shapr: East of Birmingham. Rugby?
08:39:24 <dmhouse> Down the M6 (or the A45).
08:39:33 <shapr> dmhouse: Um, the other Birmingham
08:39:41 <dmhouse> Oh. Hah. :)
08:39:44 <roconnor> anyone here use HUnit?
08:39:46 <shapr> me me!
08:39:51 <mathewm> yup
08:39:58 <shapr> roconnor: You want some nice starting code?
08:40:03 <vincenz> roconnor: it's illegal to use hunit, I suggest you go on a prozac cure
08:40:04 <roconnor> maybe
08:40:12 <shapr> roconnor: I spent the time to figure out all the IO stuff recently.
08:40:27 <roconnor> Should I put my unit tests into a new module?
08:40:27 <shapr> HUnit is quite elegant once I understood how it should work.
08:40:34 <mathewm> shapr what code do you have to share?
08:41:00 <shapr> I usually put my HUnit tests into a separate module, but when I want to test non-exported code I use --is-main to run the tests in the module.
08:41:06 <shapr> mathewm: Gobs, you want some?
08:41:19 <mathewm> HUnit-related - sure
08:41:22 <shapr> mathewm: Specifically for HUnit or what?
08:41:28 <roconnor> shapr any naming convention for the testing module?
08:41:35 <mathewm> I like putting my tests in the same code with naming conventions
08:41:52 <shapr> I use Test_$MODULE.hs but only because I haven't tried to think of something better.
08:42:00 <mathewm> then I have a script that finds the names and runs ghci with the right flags to run the tests
08:42:09 <shapr> Ah, like the quickcheck script.
08:42:13 <mathewm> yup
08:42:22 <roconnor> mathewm: Do you export your tests in your module interface?
08:42:23 <mathewm> I do both the same way
08:42:29 * xerox should understand how to use these testing tools properly
08:42:31 <mathewm> nope no need to export
08:42:42 * xerox wants to pair-program with shapr at AngloHaskell so to learn this!
08:42:57 <shapr> I've never tried pair programming with Haskell, sounds like fun.
08:43:02 <mathewm> ghci 6.5 is nice in that you can both -e and -i together
08:43:03 <roconnor> hmmm, my code is a little slow when interpreted, but not too slow
08:43:20 <roconnor> -e and -i?
08:43:21 <shapr> mathewm: What do you use that for?
08:43:28 <shapr> Oh, I get it!
08:43:29 <shapr> neat!
08:43:38 * roconnor doesn't get it
08:43:38 <mathewm> to read in my code and -e my 'runTestTT...'
08:43:58 <xerox> ?hoogle runTestTT
08:43:58 <mathewm> quickcheck had to generate code, I think
08:43:59 <lambdabot> Test.HUnit.Text.runTestTT :: Test -> IO Counts
08:44:10 <shapr> Anyway, lemme find my recent HUnit stuff..
08:44:48 <shapr> hiya dgoldsmith, have you discovered any Haskell questions since we last spoke?
08:45:17 <roconnor> what does -i do?
08:45:23 <xerox> Interactive mode.
08:45:27 <roconnor> oh
08:45:57 <shapr> I'd like to have -i happen only when a test fails.
08:46:11 <shapr> I tend to want interactive frobbing to see if I can pinpoint exactly where something blew up.
08:46:13 <xerox> Hack in a new option to do so!
08:46:19 <shapr> Hm, good idea
08:46:25 <xerox> --test
08:46:27 <SamB> what does it mean to use -e and -i together?
08:47:20 <xerox> You can create an alias who launches ghci on your code while `-e'-ing the "test'em'all!" function, for example.
08:47:52 <SamB> hmm

08:50:40 <dgoldsmith> shapr: Hi! Still learning. I've worked through all the tutorials and have ordered a copy of Haskell SOE to look at bigger examples.
08:51:20 <dgoldsmith> re: C--: has anyone looked at LLVM? http://llvm.org/
08:51:24 <shapr> dgoldsmith: That's a good book. You may assistance getting HSX11 working, feel free to ask me or others. Haskore is immensely nifty, and check out the sequels to that book in Hudak's research papers on domain specific languages.
08:51:30 <lambdabot> Title: The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project
08:52:01 <shapr> For example, Dance is a domain specific language derived from Labonotation (the paper says Labonotation is the standard dance notation for the last few decades).
08:52:10 <dmhouse> SOE?
08:52:12 <dgoldsmith> shapr: I think right now what I need most is to look at large examples of real code.
08:52:16 <shapr> School of Expression
08:52:32 <dmhouse> Fun. A book?
08:52:52 <shapr> dgoldsmith: Do you have any particular purpose in mind? If so I may be able to suggest on-topic papers or code repositories.
08:53:44 <shapr> dgoldsmith: There have been quite a few discussions of LLVM on lambda-the-ultimate.org. If C-- and LLVM interest you, you'll probably enjoy that website.
08:54:15 <dgoldsmith> shapr: Just learning the language to A) stretch my brain, and B) evaluate what kinds of things it's good for. So very general purpose right now.
08:54:27 <dgoldsmith> Oops. That was supposed to be B )
08:55:07 <shapr> In my experience, Haskell is good for speedy development. I wrote a mailing list archive search webapp in three evenings after work.
08:55:31 <kuribas> Hwo can I efficiently create a for loop?
08:55:55 <SamB> well, what do you want to loop over or through?
08:55:56 <shapr> Use a declarative analog with tail calls and an accumulator?
08:56:15 <SamB> probably you want to go through some datastructure and do something?
08:56:17 <shapr> roconnor: Is that HUnit code helpful? Does it need clarification?
08:56:17 <kuribas> SamB: Over all pixels of an image (an Array).
08:56:33 <kuribas> It works in the State Monad
08:56:34 <roconnor> shapr, you don't label any tests.
08:56:39 <SamB> what do you want to do to the pixels?
08:56:49 <kuribas> Invert them
08:56:59 <dmhouse> Map over the set of pixels.
08:57:01 <roconnor> @type map
08:57:10 <tony2> "In the programming-language world, one rule of survival is simple: dance or die." - SPJ '00
08:57:40 <kuribas> I need to have the indexes too (for later use).
08:57:52 <SamB> they will keep their indices, though!
08:57:52 <dmhouse> kuribas: In general, when you want to visit each element of some collection, applying an operation to each element, you want some form of map.
08:58:12 <MarcWebe1> Why is this function not lazy? (-> stack overflow) http://rafb.net/paste/results/bPtuzu41.html
08:58:30 <SamB> try amap
08:58:41 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
08:58:43 <vincenz> MarcWebe1: cause you're pattern matching on the tuple?
08:58:44 <SamB> @hoogle amap
08:58:45 <lambdabot> Data.Array.IArray.amap :: (IArray a e', IArray a e, Ix i) => (e' -> e) -> a i e' -> a i e
08:58:54 <kuribas> dmhouse: It works for now, but later I'll also need the indexes.
08:58:57 <int-e> @hoogle mapArray
08:58:57 <lambdabot> Data.Array.MArray.mapArray :: (MArray a e' m, MArray a e m, Ix i) => (e' -> e) -> a i e' -> m (a i e)
08:59:04 <int-e> (monadic counterpart - for ST or IO)
08:59:22 <dmhouse> kuribas: Sure. You can get the indices later then. :)
08:59:26 <MarcWebe1> vincenz: Probably
08:59:26 <sjanssen> kuribas: are you going to map on a UArray of Bools?
08:59:41 <SamB> kuribas: oh, you can do that too...
08:59:41 <dmhouse> (Unless you mean later in time, rather than later in code.)
08:59:42 <araujo> hello lambda folks!
08:59:50 <dmhouse> (In which case, use a map which gives you the index as well.)
09:00:07 <dmhouse> araujo: \hello. "there!"
09:00:19 <SamB> but, it might be trickier
09:00:40 <vincenz> \tell araujo -> "Hi"
09:00:53 <vincenz> @poke lambdabot
09:00:53 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: more vote
09:00:54 <kuribas> dmhouse: yes, later in time, the invert code is just to throw away.
09:01:46 <SamB> kuribas: you may need to write something in terms of indices
09:01:56 <SamB> or assocs, I guess

09:14:33 <roconnor> oh wait
09:14:35 <roconnor> I see

09:14:57 <dmhouse> Doesn't matter.

09:16:44 <roconnor> grr
09:16:47 <roconnor> still the same problem

09:19:23 <roconnor> what is stginit
09:19:40 <dmhouse> Some weird C thing.
09:19:53 <heatsink> the name suggests it's an initialization routine for the runtime.
09:19:54 <eivuokko> It's an function that sets up module global stuff, ie initialises a module.
09:20:57 <araujo> dmhouse, vincenz heya!
09:21:10 <dmhouse> araujo: Hi :)
09:21:13 <roconnor> grrr
09:23:24 <roconnor> ah ha!
09:23:29 <roconnor> I forgot --make
09:23:35 <zarvok> Does anyone know if there are any free Miranda compilers out there?
09:23:47 <SamB> zarvok: what for?
09:23:52 <zarvok> SamB: to play with
09:24:00 <roconnor> oh wait
09:24:01 <SamB> well, I think that there are not
09:24:02 <roconnor> that builds
09:24:09 <roconnor> but it doesn't make a ./a.out
09:24:18 <SamB> hmm?
09:24:30 <edwardk> i don't think so, miranda is commercial. the guy who wrote it went off and runs a company for it
09:24:50 <zarvok> edwardk: yeah, thanks, I thought that might be the case
09:24:53 <roconnor> zarvok: yes there are free mirana implementations
09:25:03 <dmhouse> zarvok: Have you tried Haskell? It's free :)
09:25:04 <edwardk> rconnor: url?
09:25:13 <zarvok> dmhouse: heh
09:25:21 <SamB> dmhouse: I think that zarvok would not be interested in Miranda if he did not know Haskell
09:25:21 <zarvok> roconnor:  really?  Do you know where I might find one?
09:25:38 <dmhouse> SamB: Hmm, a fair point.
09:26:41 <SamB> especially not just "to play with"
09:27:01 <zarvok> heh, indeed
09:27:32 <SamB> certainly it seems unlikely that he would be asking about it here ;-)
09:27:54 <roconnor> zarvok: nope
09:28:03 <zarvok> alas
09:28:14 <SamB> @google "free miranda"
09:28:16 <Philippa_> there's an implementation available for *nix, and if you're on windows then IIRC you can boot *nix under one of VMWare's free products these days
09:28:17 <lambdabot> http://neopets.com/sponsors/mirindastand_cn.phtml
09:28:56 <zarvok> Philippa_: I run debian, happen to know where I might find this implementation?
09:30:55 <ndm> shapr, does your blog ask if you can construct a state machine from any regular expression?
09:31:05 <ndm> cause the answer is yes, and i've got haskell code to do it :)
09:31:30 <shapr> ndm: A graphical state machine, yes
09:31:45 <ndm> shapr, graphical? as in being a graph?
09:32:01 <shapr> Whatever those pretty pix are in the paper.
09:32:24 <shapr> Surprisingly, the pretty graphs are different for the Mealy machine and the Moore machine, neither of which I've heard of before.
09:33:15 <ndm> shapr, Moore and Mealy are for expressions which output stuff
09:33:22 <ndm> regular expressions are just yes/no
09:33:33 <shapr> dcoutts: I'd send a private message first, and then a public message if he didn't agree.
09:33:36 <ndm> Moore and Mealy are equivalent, and there is a simple algorithm to convert bwetween them
09:33:50 <shapr> Neat, I had no idea.
09:34:10 <ndm> shapr, Conway's book, regular expressions, its the thing to read :)
09:34:17 <ndm> 1960's
09:34:29 <shapr> The paper is from 64, so that makes sense.
09:34:32 <ndm> I have loads of code for regular expressions
09:34:51 <int-e> ndm: Heh, I can't pin down the difference between the two to this day, because I always thought the distinction to be rather silly.
09:34:52 <ndm> I am working on a regular expression library for haskell, but have got too much code in too many places
09:34:53 <vincenz> ndm: erm
09:34:58 <vincenz> ndm: moore and mealy are more generic than regexp
09:35:02 <zarvok> shapr: The difference is just that mealy machines create output for each transition, while moore machines consider only the current state
09:35:04 <dcoutts> shapr, I was kind of thinking that half the point is to make clear public standards as well as jsut to change one individuals behaviour
09:35:06 <vincenz> ndm: they come from the abstract field of FSMs
09:35:25 <ndm> mealy vs moore is output on state, vs output on transition
09:35:27 <lispy> hmm...compile erros with hdbc-odbc on win32
09:35:32 <vincenz> ndm: yah
09:35:35 <vincenz> ndm: erm wait no
09:35:42 <vincenz> ndm: it's action on output or action on transition
09:35:47 <vincenz> not perse output
09:35:49 <lispy> c:/Program Files/Visual Haskell/include/mingw/sqltypes.h:17: parse error before "UDWORD"
09:35:56 <ndm> technically one can output somehting on no input, and the other can't - but ignoreing that they are equivalent
09:35:56 <shapr> zarvok: I read that on wikipedia, but I still don't really understand... I'll have to read up on the whole area at some point.
09:35:57 <edwardk> yeah i think i have some c++ templates around here that generate arbitrary pushdown/nfa/dfa/turing machines, etc with different tuple types
09:36:04 <tony2> dcoutts, I interpreted it as laughing at the state of current affairs. (and a bit odd)
09:36:33 <dcoutts> tony2, sure, he's not trying to be rude, it's just very easy for such comments to be taken as rude or racist
09:36:46 <ndm> shapr, do you understand normal state machines?
09:36:53 <zarvok> shapr: Basically, when deciding what to output, mealy consider the current state and the next input, while moore machines consider only the current state.  They made me draw lots of pictures in an ECE class I took, so it's burned into my memory for ever
09:37:23 <shapr> ndm: I think so.
09:37:36 <ndm> I find it much easier to say the difference is either you annotate the edges with outputs, or you annotate the states with outputs
09:37:44 <shapr> ndm: aha!
09:37:47 <shapr> Now I understand.
09:38:00 <zarvok> ndm: that's a nice explanation
09:38:22 <shapr> So Mealy machines are a more compact representation, but totally equivalent to the Moore explicit (ha) machines.
09:38:47 <zarvok> yes
09:38:50 <vincenz> dcoutts, tony2: context?
09:39:07 <shapr> ndm: Truly, that's an excellent explanation.
09:39:12 <ndm> shapr, thanks :)
09:39:24 <tony2> vincenz, Bulat message on haskell-cafe.
09:39:31 <vincenz> tony2: which one?

09:40:46 <ndm> dcoutts, i didn't figure out how/why he was assuming he was Iranian? Other than the name? But thats not very accurate
09:40:56 <vincenz> I don't think he intended it offensively
09:40:58 <shapr> Also, what's that about cheating A-bomb? I don't get it...
09:41:03 <dcoutts> ndm, yeah, that's what I was asuming
09:41:10 <dcoutts> shapr, creating I think
09:41:17 <ndm> I can only guess that the joke element has been lost in translation

09:41:31 <dmhouse> edwardk: JRegex is a PCRE front-end for Haskell. :)
09:41:43 <shapr> vincenz: haha
09:41:52 <edwardk> sounds like one of those 'lets make the american government run around and read this email' when it hits their filters kinda thing
09:42:04 <SamB> heh
09:42:05 <shapr> His English may not be perfect, but his Haskell is kick-ass.
09:42:16 <edwardk> dmhouse: i want it to work on lazy strings though =)
09:42:16 <dcoutts> aye, it's pretty good
09:42:21 <vincenz> shapr: oh sure, I'm not making fun of him, not everyone knows english as 1st lang
09:42:30 <vincenz> it's just funky to read :)
09:42:32 <dcoutts> he's often quite single mindned in design
09:42:33 <edwardk> dmhouse: coz i don't know how much of the file i will have read when i start to apply the regexp
09:42:37 <shapr> Even those who do know English as their first language often don't know it well.
09:42:44 <shapr> dcoutts: Yeah, that's true.
09:43:13 <shapr> hoi swiert
09:43:21 <vincenz> swiert: "sneezy (c) snot(t)?
09:43:27 <SamB> I like how people are always saying "english is not my first language" when they don't understand something that I don't understand either
09:43:36 <dcoutts> hey swiert how's the epigram gui going?
09:43:44 <shapr> Yeah, we want screenshots!
09:43:56 * shapr checks the e-pig blog...
09:44:04 <dcoutts> @where epigram
09:44:04 <lambdabot> http://www.e-pig.org/
09:44:17 <vincenz> is that part of e-farm?
09:44:20 <tony2> Anyway, I liked the Idea of some Iranians cooped up working on a missile control system using STM and posting to haskell-cafe for help. He was just checking, after all those pesky terrorists are *everywhere*.
09:44:49 <shapr> If I were doing something involving fission, I'd definitely use STM.
09:44:58 <alar> oh, epigram
09:45:10 <vincenz> shapr: but not fusion?
09:45:42 <shapr> I don't think you'd need STM so much with fusion.
09:45:48 <alar> are {eq} and |eq> special built-in syntax constructs or they are defined somehow?
09:46:22 <vincenz> on another topic, was reading spectrum today... CERN is getting clccose to finishing their HLC and have made a grid-computer that's worldwide to process the amount of data they generate.  The only select 1 millionth of the data by excessive filtering but have an estimate of 15MILLION Gigabytes/year of data to process
09:46:31 <shapr> Fusion is sort of like type checking, if something isn't right, you'll spot the error quite early.
09:46:53 <shapr> 15k petabytes... wow
09:47:00 <shapr> It's giga, tera, peta, isn't it?
09:47:01 <vincenz> so far they have 20000 people offering up their computer with 250GB/computer....and yeah that's only 5M gig
09:47:07 <vincenz> shapr: think so
09:47:14 <shapr> What's after peta?
09:47:19 <xerox> toomuch
09:47:19 <vincenz> exa
09:47:20 <int-e> exa? *guesses*
09:47:22 <shapr> hah
09:47:31 <vincenz> but 15M giga = 15 peta
09:47:33 <shapr> ok, 15 exabytes a year.
09:47:54 <shapr> Million is nine zeroes, isn't it?
09:47:59 <vincenz> erm no
09:48:01 <vincenz> 6
09:48:08 <shapr> You're using the european million?
09:48:13 <int-e> exa zetta yotta ...
09:48:15 <vincenz> shapr: you're thinking of billion
09:48:15 * vegai smirks at shapr
09:48:23 <vincenz> billion changes in europe vs us
09:48:25 <vincenz> not million
09:48:26 <ndm> shapr, billion = 9  (old billion = 12)
09:48:26 <shapr> C'mon, everything's bigger in the USA.
09:48:32 <ndm> but now everyone uses 9
09:48:32 * shapr ducks
09:48:36 <vincenz> shapr: to make up for their smaller genitals?
09:48:38 <shapr> ouch
09:48:41 <vegai> in the USA, 1 is 3
09:48:43 <vincenz> you asked for it :)
09:48:45 <int-e> billion = 12 ;)
09:48:46 * shapr grins
09:48:50 <shapr> I'm just being silly anyway :-)
09:48:59 <ndm> in the USA, shoe size 11 UK is 12 - its just silly
09:49:09 <shapr> I wish they'd all stick with cm sizes.
09:49:21 <shapr> But then again, I wish the whole world would switch to base ten timekeeping as well.
09:49:28 <vincenz> metric system rocks
09:49:42 <SamB> base ten timekeeping?
09:49:43 * shapr considers starting #unsafeCoerce
09:49:44 <xerox> radians!
09:49:47 <SamB> that would be so crazy...
09:49:48 * xerox cries
09:49:52 <SamB> radian timekeeping?
09:49:55 <swiert> shapr: hi.
09:50:12 <xerox> Indeed.
09:50:12 <SamB> so there would be, what, 4pi radians in a day?
09:50:16 <shapr> SamB: Um, I think base 60, base 60, base 24, base 30 is sort of insane.
09:50:19 <Philippa_> there's the slight problem that the second is a fairly fundamental part of our base-10 unit system
09:50:22 <Philippa_> whereas the day isn't
09:50:24 <xerox> SamB: it depends
09:50:25 <SamB> shapr: a bit, yeah
09:50:28 <shapr> Not counting the base 12 base 365 part.
09:50:42 <vincenz> Philippa_: and sadly the second is not a 10^n amount of cesium ticks
09:50:43 <Philippa_> the base 12 part's arguably stupid, counting years isn't particularly
09:50:45 <SamB> or at least, not very uniform
09:50:50 <SamB> but time isn't like other things anyway
09:50:56 <swiert> dcoutts: Pretty well. Joel's sent me a few screenshots that looked pretty smart.
09:51:04 <dcoutts> swiert, cool!
09:51:16 <shapr> Sure, I can go with years as a unit, but base 24 hours & base 60 minutes & base 60 seconds just doesn't make calculation easy.
09:51:23 <shapr> swiert: Can we see one?
09:51:26 <swiert> dcoutss: On the downside - he's not received funding, so that might become a bit of a problem.
09:51:28 <SamB> and people are awful particular about time
09:51:37 <swiert> shapr: sure - let me look.
09:52:09 <SamB> Philippa_: day length isn't even constant
09:52:43 <shapr> In any case, I'd like to be able to have a somewhat more uniform base 10 setup for time.
09:52:51 <Philippa_> sure. Unfortunately, it's highly relevant for people regardless
09:53:04 <Philippa_> our bodies mostly attempt to sync to it, whatever it may be
09:53:11 <shapr> But most important, I wish airports used a single time all over the world that was unaffected by time zones or daylight savings time.
09:53:12 <int-e> shapr: measure everything in seconds. noone is stopping you
09:53:30 <shapr> int-e: It doesn't interoperate well... I wrote the first version of the internet time plugin for ERC...
09:54:27 <shapr> swiert: Maybe put one of the screenshots on the epilogue?
09:54:34 <int-e> and UTC exists (although you probably want TAI? those leap seconds are nasty)
09:54:40 <shapr> I like TAI.
09:55:33 <swiert> ok - I've put something online at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~wss/Pics/epigram.png
09:55:52 <shapr> swiert: pretty!
09:56:36 <xerox> What _is_ that?
09:56:43 <shapr> New epigram GUI
09:57:04 <xerox> Wait.
09:57:10 <ndm> swiert: is that an editor as well, or just a viewer? (the title displayer suggests a viewer...)
09:57:13 <xerox> I mean, look at the syntax!
09:57:22 <Philippa_> cool
09:57:26 <xerox> Lines and arrows, where've gone!
09:57:43 <xerox> swiert - How does one get that? (I'm on OS X too.)
09:58:07 <swiert> ndm: at the moment - I think it just renders. It should evolve into a complete structure editor at some point.
09:58:15 <Philippa_> swiert: yell if you could use an additional tester under windows at some point?
09:58:29 <shapr> swiert: Oh hey, coming to AngloHaskell?
09:58:31 <Philippa_> I'm pretty much just up the road and it's not like I've anything better to do
09:58:40 <swiert> xerox: Joel Wright made it using Gtk2hs.
09:58:53 <shapr> I'd love to hear more about Epigram safety via strong normalization plus fix.
09:59:07 <SamB> oooh, does this mean I can run epigram without installing xemacs?
09:59:09 <swiert> shapr: I'm not in the UK at the moment...
09:59:21 <swiert> SamB: that would be the idea.
09:59:23 <shapr> Will you be in the UK in the beginning of August?
09:59:28 <Philippa_> there's fix in there now? I've not been following the project in far too long
09:59:39 <dcoutts> swiert, looks promising
09:59:40 <swiert> shapr: no I'm stuck in Redmond till after ICFP.
09:59:54 <shapr> swiert: Have you met Bjrn Bringert?
10:00:09 <swiert> Phillipa_: sure I'll let you know how things work out.
10:00:35 <swiert> shapr: yes. We spent the whole day in Seattle yesterday.
10:00:46 <shapr> Cool!
10:00:52 <dcoutts> swiert, I'd love to put some epigram sceenshots on the Gtk2Hs site some time :-)
10:00:59 <edwinb> swiert: ooh, gui. nice!
10:01:02 <shapr> Bjrn is a cool guy.
10:01:16 <Philippa_> swiert: cool, thanks. I should probably crash a pub get-together sometime or something - IIRC you guys use the Red Crown? (I always preferred the food in the Three Wheatsheaves, but they're never serving when I go in any more :-( )
10:01:17 <swiert> dcoutts: sure - e-mail Joel. He might have something more recent.
10:01:20 <shapr> hej ookk, hur mr du?
10:01:21 <xerox> swiert: the OS X binary on e-pig is the latest code for OS X?
10:01:25 <roconnor> shapr: I can't figureout this -is-main thing.
10:01:34 <shapr> What's the problem?
10:01:38 <roconnor> mostly because I don't seeem to know how to use ghc
10:01:45 <ookk> jag m?r bra
10:01:51 <roconnor> how do I build something without using --make?
10:02:03 <shapr> ookk: I already asked you if you live in Stockholm, didn't I?
10:02:10 <shapr> -c
10:02:15 <Philippa_> er, Rose&Crown even. Sheesh. Not been out down that end in ages, I tend to do the pubs in Dunkirk these days
10:02:18 <ookk> yeah, and i dont live there :)
10:02:20 <int-e> you add the proper package flags and all the modules you want to link.
10:02:22 <ookk> i live in s?derk?ping
10:02:23 <shapr> Ah well... I keep looking.
10:02:34 <dcoutts> swiert, btw I notice you're using OSX, you'll be pleased to hear that the latest version of Gtk+ supports OSX without needing X11, it's still somewhat imature, but it's expected to improve.
10:02:38 <roconnor> how do I link?
10:03:00 * dcoutts will get xerox to test Gtk2Hs with Gtk+ 2.10.x on OSX some time :-)
10:03:13 <xerox> Yeah!
10:03:18 <shapr> Doesn't it link automatically? I use something like ghc -c Foo.hs -o Foo
10:03:29 <swiert> Philippa_: it's fairly random what happens on Friday's. It usually depends on the weather, distance people are willing to travel, phases of the moon, etc.
10:03:40 <xerox> dcoutts: let me see if darwinports has them
10:03:54 <dcoutts> xerox, it probably doesn't yet, it's only been out a few days
10:04:02 * edwinb gets jealous of the Nottingham FP group again ;)
10:04:07 <swiert> dcoutts: Great! I'll check it out some time.
10:04:09 * xerox eagerly wants them
10:04:30 <ookk> gtk is native on osx?
10:04:48 <roconnor> $ ghc -c -is-main Data/Digest/SHA2.hs -o a.out doesn't produce an exectuable
10:04:49 <dcoutts> ookk, new feature in Gtk+ 2.10.0, but still marked experimental
10:04:51 <dozer> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/eCsDA133.html
10:05:03 <xerox> $ port info gtk2
10:05:03 <xerox> gtk2 2.8.19, x11/gtk2 (Variants: darwin_6, darwin_8)
10:05:08 <ookk> works on x86 architecture to?
10:05:09 <dozer> Si\ - I still can't find a way to build haifa-lite
10:06:37 <swiert> xerox: yes - I'm afraid all the recent work on Epigram has gone into "Version 2.0" as opposed to improving on what's out there at the moment.
10:07:06 <xerox> swiert - Such version is unpublished?
10:07:13 <Philippa_> swiert: fair enough :-)
10:07:21 <SamB> swiert: where do I get this code?
10:07:23 <swiert> xerox: yes. It's pretty much under development.
10:08:58 <shapr> swiert: Does the darcs repo mentioned on epilogue contain Epigram 2.0?
10:10:47 * roconnor sighs
10:11:00 <roconnor> it's too hot
10:11:43 <roconnor> do I need to export main or something?
10:12:01 <SamB> it is a good idea ;-)
10:12:33 <roconnor> In my case it defeats the whole purpose of putting the testing code in the module.
10:13:18 <SamB> oh, well, I don't think you need to if you use ghc -e
10:13:54 <roconnor> $ ghc Data/Digest/SHA2.hs -e main
10:13:54 <roconnor> <interactive>:1:0: Not in scope: `main'
10:14:51 <Philippa_> roconnor: exporting a testMain isn't necessarily as evil
10:16:02 <int-e> but that means the test code will be part of the library, won't it?
10:16:07 <SamB> int-e: so?
10:16:14 <SamB> nobody will call it from the program!
10:16:28 <SamB> or do you think it would cause bloat or something?
10:16:39 <int-e> a bit
10:16:41 <roconnor> shapr: Do you have some examples of your when you want to test non-exported code
10:16:56 <xerox> #ifdef it
10:17:03 <SamB> well, yeah, #ifdef isn't a bad idea
10:17:08 <roconnor> Philippa_: I'd rather put it in its own module than do that.
10:17:22 <xerox> ghc --as-main -DDEBUG -e "runtests"
10:17:33 <mathewm> If you run your test from ghci, you don't need to export your testmain
10:17:42 <SamB> quite true
10:17:52 <SamB> as long as you don't load a .o file
10:18:02 <roconnor> mathewm, you only have access though the interface if the module is compiled.
10:18:05 <mathewm> right - the .o tripped me up for a while
10:18:20 <xerox> What hasppens with the .o files?
10:18:36 <SamB> I wish it would automatically just interpret a module when you said ":m *Foo'
10:18:42 <mathewm> if the .o is up to date ghci loads it and doesn't have access to the module's internals
10:18:58 <SamB> instead of checking the .o file
10:19:22 <mathewm> For unit-testing, I don't care if the interpreted code is slower...
10:19:53 <SamB> because when I say ":m *Foo", I mean ":m *Foo", not ":m *Foo if the .o file is stale"
10:20:29 <roconnor> mathewm: sha512 $ replicate 1000000 'a' is just slow enough to be anoying
10:20:47 <swiert> sorry - I got distracted.
10:21:10 <Philippa_> SamB: :m is just "put into scope" though
10:21:13 <swiert> Epigram 2.0 is available at: http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/darcs/term
10:21:15 <lambdabot> Title: Index of /darcs/term
10:21:49 <SamB> Philippa_: BUT ":m *Foo" means "put into scope everything in module Foo, not just things it exports"
10:22:02 <SamB> er, s/BUT/but/
10:22:33 <roconnor> where is -is-main and/or --as-main documented?
10:22:46 <mathewm> GHC users guide
10:22:56 <roconnor> where in the users guide?
10:23:04 <mathewm> ?where GHC users guide
10:23:05 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc
10:23:13 <Philippa_> SamB: point. What's it doing when the object file's not stale, only showing you the exported bindings?
10:23:18 <roconnor> I can't find it in section 4
10:23:53 <SamB> Philippa_: I think so
10:23:58 <SamB> either that or failing
10:24:03 <roconnor> I can't find it in the index
10:24:28 <SamB> but I'm fairly sure it does in fact just give you the exported bindings
10:24:37 <mathewm> main-is, not is-main
10:24:49 <roconnor> oh
10:25:15 <mathewm> 4.10.7
10:27:16 <roconnor> HUnit is easy to use compared with figuring this out.
10:27:23 <roconnor> easy to write
10:27:39 <Philippa_> SamB: that's the behaviour I'd expect regardless of staleness
10:27:56 <roconnor> ghc -c Data/Digest/SHA2.hs -is-main Data.Digest.SHA2
10:27:56 <roconnor> compilation IS NOT required
10:27:56 <roconnor> ghc-6.4: file `Data.Digest.SHA2' does not exist
10:28:08 <roconnor> oh ait
10:28:11 <roconnor> main-is
10:28:13 <Philippa_> or rather, I'd expect it for all but one designated module
10:28:14 <roconnor> right
10:28:21 <Philippa_> (you can add and remove modules from scope)
10:29:28 <roconnor> I still can't build an executable
10:31:00 <dmhouse> @tell kowey Type basics is pretty much complete. Thoughts?
10:31:01 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
10:33:49 <roconnor> do I have to pass something special to use Test.HUnit so ghc can find it?
10:34:09 <roconnor> $ ghc Data/Digest/SHA2.o -main-is Data.Digest.SHA2
10:34:10 <roconnor> Data/Digest/SHA2.o: In function `r4eM_info':
10:34:10 <roconnor> : undefined reference to `TestziHUnitziBase_zdfShowCounts_closure'
10:35:49 * roconnor struggles
10:37:08 <lispy> @where missingh
10:37:08 <lambdabot> http://quux.org/devel/missingh
10:37:25 <lispy> hmm...that url seems borked
10:37:45 <dmhouse> http://quux.org/devel/missingh
10:38:01 <dmhouse> lambdabot doesn't post the title, so it's not a 200 OK response.
10:38:11 <dmhouse> And yeah, it looks borked. :)
10:38:18 <roconnor> ah ha
10:38:48 <roconnor> the problem is that the ghc docs are full of lies
10:39:00 <roconnor>  -main-is thing
10:39:07 <roconnor> An module name A. GHC assumes that the main function is A.main.
10:39:10 <roconnor> bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt
10:39:11 <roconnor> wrong
10:39:13 <roconnor> doesn't work
10:39:43 <roconnor> at least doesn't work for hierarchical modules
10:40:11 <Philippa_> how so? Module names always start with a capital anyway
10:40:38 <Philippa_> oh, wait - that'd be equivalent to A.A.main, right?
10:40:59 <palomer> they're telling you lies!
10:41:20 <JKnecht> lies, lies, and damned lies!
10:41:21 <lisppaste2> roconnor pasted "dare to compare" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/22763
10:41:27 <SamB> Philippa_: do you not know what the * is supposed to do?
10:41:56 <Philippa_> SamB: oh. Point
10:41:56 <roconnor> it only links if I end it in .main
10:43:47 <lispy> i'm unable to build hdbc-odbc too, if anyone has ideas
10:46:45 <dcoutts> lispy, on win32 right?
10:48:06 <Philippa_> SamB: file a bug report?
10:48:37 <SamB> hmm, well, wouldn't I have to try it in the latest first?
10:48:55 <lispy> dcoutts: yeah
10:49:08 <Philippa_> I think it's reasonable to file a report based on the latest release if you're on a platform where building from CVS is a PITA, especially as the bug's easy to verify
10:49:19 <Philippa_> (speaking as someone who filed a report on a bug in the win32 RTS)
10:49:23 <lispy> dcoutts: same problem as this guy: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/4873
10:49:28 <lambdabot> Title: Gmane -- Mail To News And Back Again
10:49:33 <SamB> eh, its not OS so much as CPU
10:49:46 <dcoutts> lispy, do you know which odbc impl it's supposed to work with on win32?
10:50:19 <lispy> dcoutts: what do you mean?
10:50:21 <dcoutts> lispy, does HSQL work with odbc on win32, if so try using the same versons/settings etc.
10:50:33 <dcoutts> there's not jsut one ODBC impl
10:50:36 <lispy> HSQL is working with odbc
10:51:08 <dcoutts> lispy, or ask CosmicRay
10:53:41 <lispy> oh, someone just sent me a patch that should work on windows
10:53:46 <lispy> i'll try that real quick
10:54:37 <roconnor> Is there a way to execude a binary file from a stdin?
10:54:50 * roconnor shouldn't be so crazy
10:55:59 <xerox> eval :P
10:56:24 <roconnor> ghc --make Data/Digest/SHA2.hs -main-is Data.Digest.SHA2.moduleTest -o /dev/stdout | eval
10:56:33 <roconnor> ;)
10:56:55 <xerox> Maybe an alias is enough
10:56:58 <xerox> Or a function
10:57:02 <xerox> (A bash function)
10:58:22 <roconnor> ghc --make Data/Digest/SHA2.hs -main-is Data.Digest.SHA2.moduleTest -o moduleTest && ./moduleTest && rm moduleTest
10:58:26 <roconnor> I suppose that will due.
10:59:09 <xerox> You can generate a temporary safe filename as well
10:59:16 <xerox> (Or just append $RANDOM.)
10:59:21 <dmhouse> Hey guys. I'm looking for peer review on http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Type_basics
10:59:37 <dmhouse> It's mostly complete, and mostly aimed at people with very little programming experience.
10:59:47 <roconnor> xerox: is a temporarys afe filename easy?
10:59:52 <lispy> ah, in needs to #include <windows.h>
11:00:15 <xerox> roconnor: I believe there is an util, or at least a C function, which is isolorfic to a unix util <blink>
11:01:15 * roconnor wonders if Cabal could do this all instead.
11:02:02 <SamB> isomorfic?
11:02:19 <dmhouse> Isomorphic?
11:02:29 <SamB> yeah, that
11:02:57 <shapr> hiya franka, wassup?
11:03:03 * shapr reads HACKING in the ghc repo
11:03:06 <franka> Hiya, shapr.
11:03:12 <palomer> Imosorffic?
11:03:27 <franka> Nothing's up, sadly.
11:03:39 <bringert> morning shapr
11:03:39 <shapr> No deadlines approaching?
11:03:43 <franka> (I do not speak of my sexual prowess.)
11:03:53 <shapr> hej bringert, I upgraded Hope and it was all perfectly smooth.
11:04:15 <bringert> shapr: sweet
11:04:19 <shapr> The CSS looks wrong in firefox but fine in mozilla, is that the same bug I was going to track down when I had time?
11:04:44 <bringert> what's wrong with it?
11:05:22 <shapr> The right hand column is underneath the left hand column, and the subtitle is partially under the title of blog posts.
11:05:42 <shapr> The hope theme is better, but still not perfect.
11:05:46 <greenrd> Are .hi files architecture-independent?
11:05:57 <SamB> not really, no
11:06:08 <greenrd> ah ok
11:06:27 <SamB> besides they are build-dependant
11:06:55 <bringert> shapr: it looks ok in my firefox, 1.5.0.4 on OS X. What version are you running?
11:07:14 <SamB> the *format* might be, but the contents certainly aren't
11:07:37 <greenrd> ok
11:08:14 <shapr> bringert: 1.5.0.4, lemme try turning off privoxy...
11:08:26 <shapr> oh, it is off
11:08:59 <shapr> I dunno
11:10:56 <bringert> shapr: did you shift + reload a few times?
11:11:07 <bringert> that helps in safari
11:11:10 * shapr tries
11:11:17 <bringert> it caches stylesheets too aggressively
11:11:19 <dmhouse> I swear it's Ctrl+F5, not shift.
11:11:25 <bringert> ok
11:11:29 <shapr> huh, wow
11:11:31 * bringert doesn't remember
11:11:37 <shapr> That fixed it.
11:11:41 <bringert> :-)
11:11:46 <shapr> Thanks :-)
11:11:54 <dmhouse> Weird. I just noticed pressing F5-F8 inserts a tilde.
11:12:18 <dmhouse> F9 inserts 0~, F10 1~, F11 3~ and F12 4~.
11:12:19 <bringert> maybe there is something I can put in .htaccess to get less aggressive caching
11:13:08 <dmhouse> How odd
11:15:24 * shapr considers switching back to his dual Athlon MP in order to compile GHC faster.
11:17:38 <vininim> 0~1~3~4~
11:17:45 <shapr> hiya vininim
11:17:50 <vininim> hello
11:18:24 * Igloo was considering getting out pencil and paper to compile GHC faster when bootstrapping on a mips machine recently
11:19:36 <SamB> hahaha
11:25:55 <shapr> ouch
11:26:04 <dcoutts> Igloo, does it work?
11:26:15 <dcoutts> or is mips linux still buggered
11:27:22 <Igloo> dcoutts: The machine got locked down before I finished
11:27:23 <mux> FreeBSD/mips is coming fast ;-)
11:27:30 <palomer> seems the grammar I've been implemented is incomplete
11:27:31 <palomer> ohmy.
11:28:02 <dcoutts> Igloo, oh the recent breakin
11:28:05 <dmhouse> Did anyone pick up my request for a review of my Type basics article?
11:28:09 <Igloo> Yeah
11:28:29 <dcoutts> Igloo, but there was some progress which led you to give it a go at least?
11:28:33 <Igloo> I'll let you know when finished if successful, anyway  :-)
11:28:43 <dcoutts> that'd be nice
11:28:55 <dcoutts> I've got access to a machine to test on if it helps
11:29:00 <dcoutts> a o2k in fact
11:29:05 <dcoutts> 16 cpu
11:29:11 <shapr> yow!
11:29:26 <dcoutts> 16x @400Mhz
11:29:38 <dcoutts> still, make -j16 would be nice
11:29:52 <dcoutts> ghc build system does work with parallel make these days
11:30:38 <dcoutts> we do have to ask specially for it to be turned on however, as it draws quite a bit of power :-)
11:31:41 <shapr> dcoutts: wow, impressive
11:33:10 <dcoutts> Igloo, so has anything changed? what made you decide to give it another go?
11:34:03 <lispy> oh interesting...hdbc likes to lower case column names
11:34:09 <lispy> that seems odd
11:34:15 <Igloo> Yeah, there's new GOT stuff in binutils now
11:34:32 <dcoutts> Igloo, great, do you know what version number?
11:34:58 <shapr> Has anyone tried to use STM's invariants for design-by-contract?
11:35:10 <Igloo> Not off-hand; I'm not sure if it's in upstream binutils or not yet either
11:35:16 <dcoutts> ok
11:35:18 <dmhouse> WHat would be a good introductory paper for STM?
11:35:56 <shapr> What about the first STM for Haskell paper?

11:35:57 <lambdabot>  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

11:36:25 <shapr> Probably that one :-)
11:36:46 <dmhouse> Thanks. :)
11:37:01 <arjanoosting> Igloo: you know that ghc6 FTBFS on alpha? (I did not see any bug in BTS yet)
11:37:36 <Igloo> Yes
11:37:54 <arjanoosting> any progress on that?
11:38:11 <Igloo> Again, can't do much while the porting machines are locked down  :-(
11:38:27 <shapr> Why are they locked down? Security breach?
11:38:30 <arjanoosting> of course :-)
11:38:35 <shapr> sucks
11:38:36 <Igloo> Yup
11:41:34 <monochrom> why are they breached? :)

11:52:18 <dmhouse> Depends.
11:52:19 <ookk> ok i will try to define my list like that
11:58:24 <dmhouse> Hehe :) From the STM paper I'm reading:
11:59:09 <dmhouse> "First, since a transaction may be re-run automatically, it is essential that it do nothing irrevocable. For example, the following transaction:
11:59:12 <dmhouse> atomic { if (n>k) then launch_missiles(); S2 }
11:59:18 <dmhouse> :)
11:59:52 * shapr grins
12:00:46 <Philippa_> dmhouse: I find launch_missiles to be a highly useful IO action for pedagogical purposes :-)

12:08:41 <dmhouse> shapr: Ah, okay. I don't know.
12:09:09 <shapr> ulfdoz: usually it just tells you, but it can automatically try to render them into the smallest set of conflicts, or it can dump them into an editor and let you fix them.
12:09:10 <dmhouse> ulfdoz: It edits the file to contain both versions of the conflict, and tells you that it's got some conflicts.
12:09:38 <ulfdoz> so basically the same, cvs does.
12:10:32 <ndm> ulfdoz: its cleverer than cvs
12:10:33 <shapr> For some broad definition of the same...
12:13:48 <ulfdoz> I really must try it, heard only good things of it and cvs doesn't look modern in any way.

12:23:26 <CosmicRay> someone was asking about odbc and hdbc?
12:26:54 <eivuokko> On mailing lists, atleast.  Windows compilation trouble, missing include.
12:29:34 <Lemmih> bringert: ping.
12:33:00 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, lispy was asking
12:33:16 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, and there was a patch posted on one of the lists
12:33:38 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, on the lbirareis list "Re: HDBC-ODBC compile problem"
12:34:01 <shapr> CalJohn: Are you related to Ross Paterson?
12:34:33 <xerox> Via Cal, I'd say :-)
12:35:18 <bringert> Lemmih: yes?
12:35:25 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: ah.
12:38:22 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: that patch is not suitable for applying, unfortunately.
12:38:33 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, yes that much was clear
12:38:52 <dcoutts> it needs #ifdefs
12:38:59 <Lemmih> bringert: Have you tried the MT safe fastcgi-api with other webservers than Apache?
12:39:01 <CosmicRay> and he has a hack to .cabal
12:39:04 <dcoutts> but the bit in the .cabal file is worst
12:39:05 <dcoutts> yes
12:39:07 <CosmicRay> I'm not sure how to handle that
12:39:13 <dcoutts> me neither
12:39:14 <bringert> Lemmih: no
12:39:27 <CosmicRay> I suppose I should learn about the cabal config system at some point.
12:39:41 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, supply hdbc.cabal.win32 and tell people to rename?
12:39:52 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, cabal doesn't handle conditional deps well yet
12:39:52 <Lemmih> bringert: Okay, I'm about to run some tests with lighttpd.
12:39:57 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: ah.
12:42:15 <ookk> if i have a function in two different ways: f n = let a = 2*n in f a AND f n = f (2*n) will the first one use up more memory?
12:42:34 <ookk> because it have to remember "a"
12:43:17 <norpan> possibly
12:43:23 <norpan> but not in that case
12:43:43 <norpan> but it could happen if you use a in more than one place
12:43:50 <ookk> so the compiler determines if "a" is used more?
12:44:05 <norpan> yes, or the garbage collector
12:44:26 <ookk> ok

12:45:43 <xerox> shapr: what for?
12:45:51 <shapr> xerox: Just for entertainment purposes :-)
12:46:03 <ndm> shapr, run Yhc instead
12:46:08 <xerox> Isn't the nice thing of web applications and clients that they can communicate, instead of having to run instances of the same program everywhere? :D
12:46:14 <ndm> you get parallel goodness :)
12:46:15 <shapr> I'll try YHC on the Nokia 770 soon.
12:49:33 <sjanssen> from the history paper: "warm weather seems to discourage discussion of functional programming (footnote 15)"

12:50:23 <dmhouse> Yeah, saw that :)
12:50:46 <ndm> explains why i did so little today at least :)
12:54:22 <shapr> Lots of good quotes in that history paper.
12:54:29 <shapr> Of course I'm thrilled that I got mentioned by name :-)
12:54:34 * shapr boings furiously

12:58:00 <zarvok> @where Hope
12:58:00 <lambdabot> http://hope.bringert.net/
13:00:26 <zarvok> so, hope is like the equivalent of haskell on rails?
13:01:07 <dcoutts> but typed?
13:01:11 <zarvok> heh
13:02:34 <Lemmih> Isn't Hope a blog?
13:03:09 <dmhouse> Blogging software, yeah.
13:03:19 <dmhouse> Hmm, STM seems really cool. :)
13:03:23 <zarvok> well, the website calls it "a system for haskell web applications", which suggests a broader scope, but I'm looking for more docs
13:03:42 <bringert> zarvok: I'm not sure myself
13:03:46 <Philippa_> once you've got your data store and a system for interaction, you've pretty much got that
13:03:57 <Philippa_> a web app system can be really lightweight if you look at it from a certain angle
13:04:06 <zarvok> sure
13:04:08 <bringert> zarvok: maybe it should be called a content management platform or something
13:04:08 <Philippa_> I mean, there was a constant temptation to turn Flippi into one
13:04:22 <zarvok> bringert: I see
13:04:27 <bringert> but the modules system is pretty general I think
13:04:36 <zarvok> bringert:  Looks cool though, I'll have to look into it in more detail
13:04:37 <shapr> Hope does static pages, comments, tagging of items, blog entries, photo album, and searching.
13:04:41 <zarvok> super busy this week
13:04:47 <zarvok> but later
13:04:52 <shapr> I'm going to build a commercial website with Hope in the next coupla months.
13:04:55 <bringert> searching is a bit lame though, just uses google
13:05:07 <shapr> I call that leveraging external functionality :-)
13:05:12 <zarvok> hehe
13:05:18 <bringert> shapr: have you seen the random thumbnail box?
13:05:28 <shapr> No?
13:05:43 <shapr> Next question, when can the box layout be part of the settings? :-)
13:05:59 <Philippa_> bringert: if it's not already you probably want to put that in an optional module with a warning then
13:06:24 <shapr> random photo is fun!
13:06:30 <bringert> Philippa_: the random thumbnail box?
13:06:38 <Philippa_> the search
13:06:38 <shapr> Speaking of which, I need to put a bunch of photos online soon.
13:06:40 <bringert> shapr: that would require run-time compilation, or some template language
13:06:44 <Philippa_> on account of it being google-reliant
13:06:48 <shapr> Which do you prefer?
13:06:51 <zarvok> well, I was thinking of making a new website for myself next week after the icfp contest, maybe I'll try to do it in hope, seems cool
13:07:06 <shapr> Hope is nice. It makes you want cabal-get pretty desperately though.
13:07:09 <Lemmih> bringert: Multithreading doesn't work with lighttpd either /-:
13:07:13 <bringert> Philippa_: ah, it's already optional, and all it does is give you a Google search box
13:07:18 <Philippa_> a template language is probably preferable for now
13:07:39 <Philippa_> when in doubt, don't expose run-time compilation to users
13:07:59 <Philippa_> in fact, if you don't have all but a full-blown formal proof that it's a good idea, don't do it
13:08:15 <bringert> shapr: try putting randomThumbBox in your boxes
13:08:15 <Philippa_> ("it's the whole point of the app" might count, if you're lucky)
13:08:35 <bringert> or randomThumbSizeBox :: Maybe Int -> Maybe Int -> Hope Box
13:08:43 <shapr> bringert: Cool, I'll try that later. Right now I'm hacking on GHC for the first time. It's easier than I expected.
13:08:48 <bringert> to only get thumbnails of a given width and/or height
13:08:55 <shapr> Oh that's a neat idea.
13:08:59 <bringert> shapr: nice, what are you doing?
13:09:00 <shapr> That way you can preserve layout.
13:09:05 <bringert> right
13:10:04 <shapr> Part of the MSR interview process is to fix a bug that's worth about a day's effort. I don't do well starting with big chunks so I picked a one hour bug to start with. The GHC internals aren't nearly as scary as they were when I looked at them shortly a few years ago.
13:10:46 <shapr> Finding the bug and how to solve it was easy, now I just have to actually write the code to connect all the dots.
13:10:55 * shapr boings cheerfully.
13:11:23 <shapr> But first, some unicycling
13:13:03 <shapr> Of course, I wouldn't call GHC crystal clear either...
13:13:37 <Philippa_> are you happy you can show you've not introduced bugs in the process?
13:13:40 <Philippa_> you might get asked that
13:14:26 <shapr> I don't understand the question?
13:14:50 <Philippa_> given a sufficiently complicated app, typical debugging procedures're better described as rebugging...
13:14:57 <shapr> Pure FP means I know I haven't touched anything else.
13:14:58 <Philippa_> how do you know you're not rebugging rather than debugging?
13:15:00 <shapr> Oh, I see what you mean.
13:15:22 <shapr> Since I'm planning on adding a unit test as well...
13:15:36 <Philippa_> Pure FP is a good start to the argument :-) Not sufficient with something like GHC where there're non-trivial invariants, of course
13:16:06 <shapr> Actually, I've mentioned STM's invariants in my notes as a good thing to add in several places.
13:16:26 <shapr> design by contract in Haskell
13:18:51 <greenrd> How are the invariants expressed?
13:20:15 <shapr> I don't remember, check out the data invariants paper - http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/
13:20:33 <tony2> Has anyone read SPJ's book on implementing FP languages?
13:20:48 <shapr> I do remember that it's really smooth since you can attach invariants to particular ADTs, meaning they're GC'd when you're not using those ADTs anymore.
13:21:14 <shapr> anyway, uni
13:21:40 <sethk> tony2, I have, why?
13:23:20 <tony2> sethk, wondering if I should get it. I've not read anything specific on FP, what did you think? Digestable?
13:23:48 <sethk> tony2, it's quite good and quite digestible, but most of the info, much more up to date, is in his papers that you can read online
13:24:17 <sethk> tony2, the book is hard to find, also
13:24:27 <lambdabot> Title: Papers on transactional memory
13:25:02 <sethk> a bit lame, lambdabot, but there wasn't really a title for it to snarf...
13:25:59 <Lemmih> shapr: I think it's pretty hard picking a good bug.
13:26:33 <tony2> sethk, wow, the book is on his web site also!
13:27:07 <sethk> tony2, that's even better.  It wasn't when I looked for it, but that was years ago.
13:38:05 <bringert> time for lunch
13:42:11 <edwardk> tony2: i've been reading it off and on in my spare time
13:42:51 <dmhouse> Yay. I understand the operational semantics of STM. :)
13:43:00 <edwardk> heh
13:43:06 <edwardk> STM is good stuff
13:50:39 <monochrom> Wow, you do!
13:51:09 <dmhouse> monochrom: ?
13:52:58 <tieTYT> is haskell a poor choice for a scripting language?  To write quick scripts i normally write in awk/perl/bash?
13:52:58 <monochrom> You understand the operational semantics of STM :)
13:53:15 <tieTYT> err, i meant "for a language to write quick scripts in"
13:53:28 <dmhouse> Oh, heh. I was just quite proud because it's the first formal bit of a paper I've tried to understand.
13:53:51 <monochrom> Haskell is not a poor choice for scripting.  Not the most convenient but usable.
13:53:56 <dmhouse> tieTYT: Sometime, sometimes not.
13:54:10 <dmhouse> Haskell lacks elite string manipulation.
13:54:51 <Philippa_> it lacks cryptically concise string manipulation
13:55:01 <monochrom> On the front of spawning child processes and making pipelines of them, there is a SoC project.
13:55:13 <tieTYT> does it take a lot of effort to get a haskell script to run?  awk vs java is like 'awk -f file file' vs 'java -classpath "confusing shit" com.blah...Main'
13:55:19 <Philippa_> if you're happy to import Parsec and don't mind slightly more typing, it's still really good at doing it and probably more readable in practice
13:55:31 <Philippa_> anyone who's met BNF before should be able to get the gist of a parsec parser...
13:55:59 <monochrom> I think "scripting" is still too broad for any assessment.
13:56:15 <ndm> tieTYT: runhaskell script.hs
13:56:18 <tieTYT> monochrom: a quick program you don't plan to maintain.
13:56:24 <tieTYT> ndm: cool
13:56:32 <ndm> or with hugs, runhugs script.hs
13:56:32 <monochrom> (I know and write and use certain scripts with no string manipulation whatsoever, for example.)
13:56:34 <Philippa_> ndm: that, or a #! line at the top
13:56:55 <tieTYT> alright sounds cool, thanks
13:56:56 <tieTYT> ttyl
13:57:07 <Philippa_> tieTYT: I think that's often misleading, a lot of scripts need maintenance in practice and it's at least semi-known whether many given scripts're likely to need it in future
13:57:09 <Philippa_> bah
13:57:20 <Philippa_> haskell beats perl hands-down for maintainable scripting, IMO...
13:57:31 <monochrom> "a quick program you don't plan to maintain" is still too broad.
13:58:29 <heatsink> What is a hi-boot-boot file?
13:58:48 <dmhouse> Two boots?
13:58:50 <heatsink> yes
13:59:01 <monochrom> I teach a class on using a formal method to write programs.  (Evidently we end up writing just toy programs.)  A typical assignment is like "write and prove correct a program for: finding the minimum segment sum of a list".  This is a quick program you write once, hand it in, and never maintain it.  So it's a script, isn't it?
13:59:01 <dmhouse> Someone's got _very_ cyclic module dependencies :)
14:00:19 <heatsink> I suppose I can't import A.hs from B.hs-boot when B.hs-boot imports A.hs
14:00:23 <monochrom> By that standard, my whole course is about scripting, and Haskell is the perfect language.
14:01:45 <Philippa_> for *your* scripts
14:01:54 <ndm> monochrom: i think he is probably not meaning script = requires a formal proof ;)
14:01:59 <Philippa_> to declare it the perfect language for scripting it'd have to be so across the majority of if not all scripts
14:04:12 <monochrom> I feel comfortable saying all this because he's left.  If he were here, he would fire back, "yeah yeah, that's just semantics."  I so hate people who fire that back.  If you don't look at the semantics, what do you have left?
14:04:58 <dcoutts> it works! what more do you want?!
14:05:01 <dcoutts> ;-)
14:05:25 <int-e> dcoutts: that's too strong. "it works for me" ought to be enough really ;)
14:05:32 <dcoutts> heh, even better
14:06:05 <ndm> monochrom: Haskell has a semantics?
14:06:07 <Philippa_> monochrom: I recently posted on alt.polyamory something like: semantics are irrelevant, and how dare you say that about frogs!
14:06:41 <Philippa_> ndm: no one formal semantics. Equational reasoning holds well enough to write proofs though
14:07:00 <ndm> Philippa_: yeah, i know - but for my PhD i need a formal semantics
14:07:08 <ndm> equational reasoning just doesn't work for my particular task
14:07:23 <monochrom> Heh.  So, I have seen enough scripts and also written enough of my own to know that they are just too diversed.
14:07:32 * sm finishes the history paper.. that was great!
14:07:49 <Philippa_> ndm: yeah, I'm not aware of anyone having sat down and written a formal dynamic semantics
14:08:15 <ndm> Philippa_: the Oregon people have done little bits, but its still incomplete
14:08:19 <Philippa_> I can think of reasons one might choose not to, as well - you'd run a serious risk of accidentally specifying lazy evaluation when you didn't mean to, for example
14:08:36 <ndm> I can probably get away with a semantics for Yhc Core, which should be doable
14:08:39 <monochrom> You could formalize the Haskell 98 report :)
14:08:55 <ndm> that task sounds like a PhD on its own...
14:09:05 <mahogny> indeed
14:09:16 <mahogny> especially the new type class extensions
14:09:21 <ndm> its a shame that Haskell's dynamic semantics requires its static semantics
14:10:09 <ndm> otherwise it might be a little easier
14:10:17 <monochrom> Simon Peyton Jones's "the awkward squad" treatise has an operational semantics of the IO and concurrency (mvar's) part.  I was at that summer school and saw it in its full glory (full horror).
14:11:31 <dmhouse> People refering to 'semantics' as a singular noun sounds wrong to me, even though it's undoubtably correct.
14:12:34 <monochrom> John Launchbury, "A Natural Semantics for Lazy Evaluation"   this may be a good starting point.
14:12:43 <monochrom> (If you write from scratch)
14:13:12 <monochrom> dmhouse: "mathematics is fun" does that also sound wrong to you? XD
14:13:36 <monochrom> "arithmetics is boring"  now this one is wrong :)
14:14:38 <mahogny> arithmetics is very boring if it happens to be IEEE floating point values and in a setting of formal verification :(
14:15:00 <monochrom> it should be "arithmetic", mahogny.  :D
14:15:09 <mahogny> baah
14:15:29 <monochrom> It's a tricky trippy one.
14:16:15 <ndm> monochrom: oh, thanks, will take a look at that
14:18:12 <ndm> although i think i can make my semantics even simpler - sharing is irrelevant for my purpose
14:19:04 <monochrom> "static semantics"  does it usually mean denotational semantics?
14:19:34 <monochrom> Darn, it means the type system.
14:19:39 <ndm> for haskell, it usually means a lot of type thoeyr
14:20:38 <Philippa_> monochrom: those aspects that don't involve running the program. And yes, in practice that's mostly the type system
14:21:16 <monochrom> http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu/bakewell00space.html  "a space semantics of haskell"  you may also find something copy-able from this.
14:21:17 <lambdabot> Title: A Space Semantics for Core Haskell - Bakewell, Runciman (ResearchIndex)
14:21:18 <Philippa_> although if you want to talk about partially evaluating based on all non-input parameters I guess there's a form of static semantics there derived from the dynamic semantics
14:21:35 <monochrom> err the correct title is as lambdabot says
14:25:02 <monochrom> The Haskell 98 report contains many translations of many nice constructs into a very barebone subset of Haskell.  You may have a good chance formalizing just the barebone.  It may be also less error-prone.
14:26:33 <monochrom> For example, in pattern matching, the difference between say "(x:xs)" and "~(x:xs)" is already taken care of in the translation.  They translate into different barebone code.  You will have little trouble getting them right.
14:26:50 <monochrom> (You will have to work very hard to get them mixed up. :) )
14:32:12 <Philippa_> remind me of the translation?
14:36:50 <lispy> roughly speaking is this true? int foo(void); ---> foo :: () -> IO CInt
14:37:02 <lispy> i'm wondering what to use inplace of void
14:37:13 <dcoutts> lispy, IO CInt will do
14:37:36 <lispy> oh, yeah taht makes more sense
14:38:59 <dmhouse> What's the point of the void argument?
14:39:24 <dcoutts> it's the same as none
14:39:35 <dcoutts> in C: int foo(void);  === int foo();
14:39:50 <norpan> not quite
14:39:51 <heatsink> dmhouse: I think it's to distinguish ANSI syntax from K&R syntax or something
14:39:56 <norpan> void means there are no arguments
14:40:04 <dmhouse> s/void/unit/, sorry.
14:40:14 <norpan> if you leave it out there could be arguments
14:40:23 <dmhouse> I mean why is it foo :: () -> IO CInt instead of foo :: IO CInt
14:40:31 <norpan> it's not
14:40:33 <dcoutts> norpan, I was assuming that was a prototype
14:41:32 <dcoutts> norpan, so how does it make a difference exactly?
14:43:49 <norpan> well it makes no difference other than the compiler knows and could give better messages
14:44:01 <monochrom> Philippa_: for example http://haskell.org/onlinereport/exps.html#sect3.17.3
14:44:02 <lambdabot> Title: The Haskell 98 Report: Expressions
14:44:58 <monochrom> Case (d) deals with ~(whatever) and some extra code is generated.
14:45:36 <monochrom> An extra function call.
14:47:21 <monochrom> So, "case v of x:xs -> ..."   this examines v at once.
14:49:13 <monochrom> "case v of ~(x:xs) -> ..."  this becomes (\x xs -> ...) (case v of (x:xs) -> x) (case v of (x:xs) -> xs)  so there is an extra function application, which has a good chance of postponing things a bit more.
14:49:40 <monochrom> (For example if "..." does nothing, you're saved!)
14:52:47 * heatsink notices that ghc doesn't warn about effectively overlapped pattern matches resulting from lazy pattern matching.
14:55:34 * dcoutts feels ndm's pain at: let isWindows = "mingw" `isPrefixOf` System.Info.os

15:14:17 <lambdabot> I heard andersca is a pirate
15:14:40 <shapr> Me too
15:16:02 <monochrom> A pirate of the Caribbeans? :)
15:16:30 <norpan> andersca?
15:17:32 <monochrom> yeah
15:18:52 <shapr> Andersca advertised "Talk Like a Pirate Day" for weeks ahead of time.
15:20:46 <dcoutts> which isn't too far off iirc
15:21:29 <shapr> I heard andersca has left Sweden.
15:25:16 <ndm> dcoutts, am glad you feel my pain
15:25:25 <dcoutts> :-)
15:25:31 <Ulfalizer> shapr: it's easy to get a little too excited with the pirate party and all that :/
15:26:19 <dcoutts> ndm, you know in all my gentoo packaging experience I've not found a single Setup.hs that was correct (except for the default of course - and even then ;-) )
15:26:34 <dcoutts> ndm, the customisations are inevitably wrong
15:26:44 <dcoutts> bacause people can't think about all the situations
15:26:53 <dcoutts> like we can hack into a tool like cabal
15:27:20 <ndm> that fills me with confidence...
15:27:47 <ndm> unfortunately it appears that if i want a program to work on windows, it involves shouting at someone
15:27:57 <ndm> hence my Haskell on Windows project :)
15:27:58 <shapr> How so?
15:28:00 <shapr> oh
15:28:16 <dcoutts> ndm, so argue for adding cabal features rather than people needing to customise Setup.hs
15:28:24 <monochrom> In all my get-the-tarball experience I've not found a single Setup.hs that was incorrect.
15:28:31 <dcoutts> ndm, and keep sending the patches to make Cabal do the right thing on win32
15:28:36 <ndm> dcoutts: cabal is an inherently Unix specific tool
15:28:51 <ndm> for example, with Haddock, it freezes in the path at compile time!!!!
15:28:57 <monochrom> Ah, windows.  I haven't tried that.
15:29:02 <ndm> which means there is no such thing as a universal binary
15:29:23 <ndm> and Haddock 0.8 on Windows freezes in the path as D:\haddock_0.8, which doesn't even exist
15:29:34 <dcoutts> ndm, I disagree, I think these things are just bugs which are fixable
15:29:38 <ndm> no windows user wants to "configure" then "build" thjings
15:29:50 <shapr> Whoever gets the GHC engineer job will help with cross-platform stuff.
15:30:05 <dcoutts> ndm, most unix users don't either, they rely on packages
15:30:08 <ndm> dcoutts: i think if everyone is forced to release a Yhc bytecode file, which is their app without any static compile time hacks, the world would be a better place
15:30:22 <dcoutts> ndm, but building packages that are cabalised is much more regular than everything else
15:30:36 <ndm> dcoutts: regular is good, but cabal is very much a static build system
15:30:54 <ndm> i would rather a dynamic application, i.e. System.FilePath, it picks the right behaviour at runtime
15:30:59 <dcoutts> ndm, that partly reflects the community focus on ghc, get yhc finnished! :-)
15:31:10 <ndm> i.e. why do the Cabal path functions get compiled in, when they could be runtime
15:31:15 <ndm> dcoutts: i know...
15:31:24 <ndm> and the community focus on Linux
15:31:51 <dcoutts> ndm, I thought that cabal didn't bake in any paths on windows, like it does on unix
15:32:17 <ndm> dcoutts: GHC 6.4.2, it certainly looks like it does
15:32:17 <dcoutts> ndm, it provides functions for getting data file paths at runtime for jsut that reason
15:32:31 <ndm> then why not provide the same functions on Linux?
15:32:43 <ndm> and hvae them in a library
15:32:50 <ndm> and then throw away Cabal configure
15:32:52 <dcoutts> because there's not the same mechanism for discovering the data file locations on unix
15:33:05 <ndm> yeah, then submit a bug fix for unix :)
15:33:23 <dcoutts> it works in windows becaue you can find the location of the bianry and then find things relative to that
15:33:32 <dcoutts> you can't do that in unix, and for good reason
15:33:47 <ndm> how do you find the location of the binary? Haskell doesn't seem to let you...
15:33:49 <dcoutts> and there's a more standardised file system layout, so it's not really a problem
15:33:58 <dcoutts> ndm, Win32 has a function to do that
15:34:29 <ndm> dcoutts: but it doesn't seem to be part of standard Haskell, I don't really want to use Win32 bits
15:34:55 * dcoutts looks
15:35:12 <eivuokko> I think it is part of stdish bits too
15:35:46 <ndm> in Hoogle i had to do horrible findExecutable stuff, which sucks totally
15:37:44 <ndm> dcoutts: i actually plan a proper Win32 cabal interface in the near future, its just hard to find the time...
15:37:55 <ndm> i.e. a clicky clicky thing
15:38:09 <dcoutts> ndm, oh something that builds win32 packages from cabal packages?
15:38:16 <ndm> also, why does Cabal check for loads of things in configure - i.e. hsc2hs or whatever, when they are not required by the library?
15:38:19 <dcoutts> like we do for debian & gentoo
15:38:28 <shapr> hi shawn
15:38:28 <ndm> dcoutts: no, something that takes a Cabal and "does the goods" on it
15:38:29 <dcoutts> ndm, submit a patch
15:38:39 <shapr> bye shawn
15:38:39 <ndm> i.e. associate .cabal files with a nice pretty gui
15:38:50 <dcoutts> ndm, oh jsut compiles & installs it there and then
15:38:52 <ndm> its easier to keep it out of cabal, do it in C, and add it to WinHaskell
15:38:54 <ndm> yep
15:38:59 <dcoutts> right
15:39:19 <dcoutts> ndm, perhaps wait for cabal-get and add a gui for that
15:39:45 <shapr> Wow, #haskell has more traffic than #debian some days: http://meme.b9.com/channels.html
15:39:48 <lambdabot> Title: Meme channels
15:40:30 <shapr> #haskell ... we talk so much because a productive language lets you finish your code early.
15:40:45 <ndm> dcoutts: maybe, i want to get Cabal on windows being nice and windows friendly
15:41:18 <dcoutts> ndm, a gui for cabal-get should be friendly and have all the cabal-get features
15:41:53 <dcoutts> ie ability to compile & install local packages or ones from the hackage online db
15:42:21 <ndm> dcoutts, i disagree - less features is better
15:42:32 <ndm> a little bit of search, a lot of automation
15:42:33 <dcoutts> fair enough
15:42:54 * dcoutts doesn't understand
15:43:19 <ndm> i.e, searching for a package is what people do, installing/configuring/compiling is something windows users don't like
15:43:33 <dcoutts> right, cabal-get automates that
15:44:18 <ndm> how far along is cabal-get?
15:44:28 <dcoutts> xerox is working on it for the SoC
15:44:40 <dcoutts> it's going to be included with Cabal
15:45:17 <dcoutts> ndm, so just make sure it's split into a lib + command line tool so it's easy to integrate into a gui
15:45:39 <ndm> i will probably take off the command line tool, to be honest
15:45:45 <ndm> easier than interfacing C to haskell
15:46:03 <dcoutts> of course I'd write the gui in Haskell too ;-)
15:47:09 <ndm> maybe, maybe not - i am half thinking about moving WinHaskell to Haskell, but am not entirely convinced yet
15:47:21 <ndm> I'll see how the hat stuff progresses
15:47:34 <ndm> how is command line capturing in Haskell?
15:47:38 <dcoutts> keep me informed, I do want to make Gtk2Hs work better on win32
15:48:25 <ndm> the only issue really is the large size of the generated binaries
15:48:50 <ndm> a complete installer of all the dependancies as well would be nice, even if its mega big :)
15:49:22 <ndm> and of course a nice interface over Gtk2Hs which was more "haskell" in feel would be lovely :)
15:49:32 <dcoutts> indeed
15:49:41 <ndm> naturally, i have already started prototyping one :)
15:49:46 <dcoutts> good!
15:49:48 <norpan> naturally
15:49:50 <dcoutts> ;-)
15:49:59 <dcoutts> there was some experiments with arrows
15:50:06 <ndm> i designed a concept called PropLang ages ago, i want to go in that direction
15:50:09 <monochrom> What is "haskell in feel"?
15:50:14 <dcoutts> they seem to have problems with traversing graphs too many times iirc
15:50:17 <ndm> monochrom: beautiful
15:50:20 <norpan> arrows are a solution looking for questions
15:50:32 <ndm> my rough concept is:
15:50:40 <ndm> a variable is a piece of state with a value
15:50:49 <dcoutts> ndm, I had some ideas too, lets see how they compare
15:50:51 <ndm> you can assign and get from a variable
15:51:01 <ndm> but most importantly  you can bind to a variable
15:51:03 <dcoutts> ndm, and get notified of changes?
15:51:11 <ndm> yes :)
15:51:31 <ndm> or rather changes propagate so that when the variable changes an action runs, based on that variable
15:51:31 <monochrom> An observable in the "observer pattern"
15:51:38 <dcoutts> so you can declare relations between widget properties and other bits of internal state
15:51:45 <ndm> exactly
15:51:48 <dcoutts> yeah
15:52:09 <dcoutts> I started on some prototype code for that kind of thing
15:52:10 <ndm> I did a demo of it in C# once, it was very beautiful
15:52:25 <ndm> but entirely typeless, because of the way C# is designed
15:52:27 <monochrom> Ah!  The observer pattern is trivial.  But streamlining the language/library support is the question.
15:52:27 <dcoutts> should be even nicer in Haskell :-)
15:52:38 <ndm> exactly, it perfectly suits haskell
15:52:55 <dcoutts> Gtk+ supports notifications on widget property changes
15:53:01 <ndm> yes, i saw that
15:53:20 <ndm> i might knock up a design on the wiki and run it passed you?
15:53:25 <dcoutts> sure
15:53:32 <ndm> @wiki PropLang
15:53:32 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/PropLang
15:53:54 <dcoutts> then we'd extend the Gtk2Hs property api so it allows poperties to be bound
15:54:05 <ndm> yes, definately
15:54:21 <ndm> and you need some sort of variable thingy, which has set, get and watch on it
15:54:23 <dcoutts> ndm, a tricky bit is avoiding cyclic notification storms
15:54:44 <dcoutts> ndm, you might want to read Manuel's ports paper
15:54:46 <dcoutts> it's a similar idea
15:54:56 <dcoutts> but too much heavyweigh threading imho
15:55:01 <ndm> dcoutts: if we were purely functional, then its easy enough
15:55:05 <monochrom> do { ... button -->>-- count; count -->>-- display; ... }   This notation will be krad!
15:55:19 <ndm> i read that paper, yeah, i agree with the concept but he's off in a few places
15:55:44 <ndm> (if thats the one i am thinking off, designed around hardware design more as a motivation?)
15:56:00 <dcoutts> hmm
15:56:24 <dcoutts> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ports/
15:56:24 <lambdabot> Title: The Haskell Ports Library
15:56:43 <ndm> oh, no, not that one
15:57:09 <ndm> will take a read
16:00:26 <dcoutts> ndm, another issue with that kind of observer setup is how it scales to cmplex data
16:00:47 <ndm> dcoutts: i did consider that, like observing cells in grids etc
16:00:47 <dcoutts> eg the data for widgets displaying big lists, trees etc
16:00:54 <dcoutts> right
16:01:02 <dcoutts> you want to send deltas
16:01:06 <ndm> i had a few ideas in the C# implementation
16:01:10 <dcoutts> so the UI can make the minimal updates
16:01:14 <ndm> yeah, thats b asically it
16:01:29 <ndm> i am not sure if i can make the whole thing pure or not - that would be nice
16:01:38 <ndm> i.e. setup the functions, then fire off pure actions
16:01:44 <dcoutts> right
16:02:02 <dcoutts> I was also considering a design that didn't keep any state at all
16:02:07 <dcoutts> just passed changes about
16:03:12 <ndm> yes, my concern with that was inserting cells etc.
16:03:22 <ndm> I don't think its a problem to have read only state
16:03:30 <ndm> and then return as a result a list of actions pending
16:03:47 <dcoutts> though it makes connecting to a 'port' later tricky
16:03:57 <dcoutts> if you can't reconstruct the whole state easily
16:04:28 <ndm> the whole state will always have to be in the gtk2hs layer
16:04:36 <ndm> so it can always be queryied from there in teh IO monad
16:05:24 <dcoutts> mm, not ideal
16:05:37 <dcoutts> I rather liked the just passing the changes around idea
16:05:42 <dcoutts> it works for simple states
16:05:53 <ndm> my idea is to have a setup phase, where you register the modifers
16:06:10 <dcoutts> if you never have to change the network then it's all fine
16:06:10 <ndm> then a manager in the IO monad that does the work of calling off to the modifiers
16:06:20 <dcoutts> which perhaps is all we should aim for
16:06:44 <ndm> i disagree, but as an action you can return a change to a network
16:06:52 <dcoutts> there's a reasonably wide design space
16:06:59 <ndm> yeah, and i  didn't find much else
16:07:03 <dcoutts> which is partly why I didn't take it that far
16:07:23 <dcoutts> there were more pressing things on the Gtk2Hs TODO list
16:07:29 <ndm> always pressing things
16:07:30 <dcoutts> there still are from my point of view
16:07:43 <ndm> i wrote a bibliography manager with my proplang in C#
16:07:45 <ndm> it was very cute
16:07:45 <dcoutts> like finnishing the new tree/view api
16:07:58 <ndm> things like the search button gets disabled when there is no search text in the box
16:08:12 <ndm> and in a way that doesn't require tracking changes all over the place
16:08:49 <dcoutts> ndm, yeah, that's nice
16:09:21 <ndm> i'll wait til the other gtk2hs user in york is in, and have a whiteboard session with him on teh ideas, see wh at we can com eup with
16:09:44 <dcoutts> you'll keep me informed :-)
16:09:59 <ndm> of course :)
16:10:03 <dcoutts> there's the Gtk2Hs wiki to record stuff
16:10:09 <ndm> no doubt i'll be complaining about something in Gtk2hs very soon :)
16:10:21 <dcoutts> (or rather the Gtk2Hs section of the main haskell.org wiki)
16:10:29 <dcoutts> ndm, yep, good good :-)
16:10:30 <monochrom> Looking forward to this development.
16:10:49 * dcoutts is looking forward to the next release
16:10:56 <dcoutts> which will be packed with new features
16:11:09 <ndm> interface changes as well? or just additions?
16:11:18 <dcoutts> both sadly
16:11:26 <dcoutts> it's our last api shakup before 1.0
16:11:36 <dcoutts> actually it's mostly backwards compatible
16:11:48 <dcoutts> the thing that's really changing is the treeview api
16:11:56 <ndm> i know that yhe won't work without gtk2hs head
16:12:33 <dcoutts> we're improving the signals api, but in a add new + deprecate old way
16:12:47 <Philippa_> will the deprecated stuff be marked in the docs?
16:12:51 <dcoutts> so you'll get a ton of deprecation warnings
16:13:12 <dcoutts> and the warnings even have helpful suggestions for the replacements code
16:13:59 <dcoutts> we're also tring to shrink the docs slightly by removing redundant stuff
16:23:01 <Lemmih> sjanssen, dcoutts: Will you report that bug?
16:23:48 <dcoutts> Lemmih, oh the fix error
16:24:56 <dcoutts> yeah ok
16:25:40 <dcoutts> ndm, btw I was looking in the cabal source and it does have some stuff for generating relocatable progs on win32
16:25:52 <ndm> dcoutts: that would be useful
16:25:55 <dcoutts> in the $package_Paths.hs module
16:26:17 <dcoutts> and that's in the cabal that comes with 6.4.2
16:26:34 <dcoutts> so see what that module looks like for your haddock-0.8
16:26:53 <ndm> one sec, i build haddock on a different computer, just checking it out
16:27:02 <dcoutts> haddock/dist/build/autogen/Paths_Haddock.hs
16:27:48 <dcoutts> ndm, under win32 it's absolute in some circumstances and relocatable in others. I don't quite understand the condition.
16:28:24 <dcoutts> ndm, see the cabal source: Distribution/Simple/Build.hs buildPathsModule
16:28:31 <dcoutts> and the definition of absolute
16:28:44 <dcoutts> #if mingw32_HOST_OS
16:28:44 <dcoutts>         absolute = hasLibs pkg_descr || flat_bindirrel == Nothing
16:28:44 <dcoutts> #else
16:28:44 <dcoutts>         absolute = True
16:28:44 <dcoutts> #endif
16:30:52 <ndm> have got the haddock one now, just going through it
16:31:18 <ndm> haddock doesn't compile at the mo, which is, ahem, interesting...
16:32:45 <ndm> it has decided haddock-0.8 should be in every path
16:32:48 <ndm> which is a bit weird
16:35:01 <ndm> but it does do relative from the binary, which is good
16:44:58 <dcoutts> if you think the behaviour is still wrong then bring it up on the libs or cabal-devel list
16:47:07 <shapr> Yow!
16:47:53 <ndm> I'll try and figure out exactly what hte beahviour is
16:48:09 <ndm> it may be a haddock issue, since it appeared some of the static files weren't getting moved around properly
16:48:40 <kitababe> wats up
16:48:44 <shapr> Ceilings.
16:48:57 <kitababe> asl
16:49:05 <shapr> Are you serious?
16:49:18 --- mode: ChanServ set +o shapr
16:49:23 <shapr> Ok then.
16:49:32 <dylan> 45/no/alaska
16:49:36 <shapr> hah
16:49:52 <shapr> dylan: Your hostname implies Fla
16:50:05 <dylan> shapr: all government lies!
16:50:18 <shapr> Anyway, time for me to sleep
16:50:23 <shapr> nearly 2am again
16:50:30 <ndm> sleep?
16:50:37 <ndm> whats that...
16:50:44 <dylan> yeah, that happens twice a day.
16:50:48 <dylan> err, once a day.
16:50:53 <shapr> I did five hours of unicycling over the weekend that's left me a bit tired still.
16:51:17 <dylan> unicycling? cool
16:51:33 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: someone emailed me asking to use that unicycle pic from my blog on their web site.
16:52:51 <shapr> cool!
16:53:31 <dcoutts> heh
16:54:52 <shapr> dylan: Yeah, #unicycling is active and happy.
16:55:19 <tony2> how hard is unicycling? (I know that's not a good question, hard relative to what and all that)
16:56:02 <tony2> um, average learning time? for basic proficency.
16:56:11 <shapr> Not that hard. It takes about ten hours of learning to be able to roll around without holding onto anything.
16:57:11 <tony2> cool!
16:57:19 <tony2> I think I'll invest.
16:57:25 <shapr> tony2: If you come to AngloHaskell I'll give you some lessons :-)
16:58:00 <tony2> shapr, sounds tempting, but I holidaying that weekend.
16:58:04 <shapr> Ah, too bad.
16:58:18 <sethk> shapr, I can roll around without holding on to anything.  Only, I roll around on the floor.
16:58:23 <shapr> hah
16:58:36 <sethk> shapr, I never fall  :)
16:59:08 <edwinb> Are you bringing a unicycle to AngloHaskell so we can all embarrass ourselves? :)
16:59:26 <shapr> I'll bring one, I think Lemmih and dcoutts will bring one of theirs as well.
16:59:51 <ndm> SyntaxNinja: why does cabal always check for every single package at configure time, not just the ones it needs?
17:00:16 <dcoutts> ndm, no reason as far as I know
17:00:25 <greenrd> hmm, what will happen at AngloHaskell?
17:00:31 * greenrd has read the wiki page
17:00:39 <dcoutts> ndm, add a bug report or preferably a patch :-)
17:00:41 <Philippa_> beer, geeking, possibly coding
17:00:46 <ndm> sounds like I will get drunk while everyone else unicycles
17:00:51 <Philippa_> probably not all at once, but then someone'll bring a laptop...
17:00:52 <greenrd> heh
17:00:59 <SyntaxNinja> ndm: what do you mean that it checks for every single package?
17:01:06 <edwinb> I'll bring a note from my mum so I can get out of unicycling and stay in the pub
17:01:09 <shapr> edwinb: hah
17:01:10 <Philippa_> oh yeah, unicycling. Probably Go. I'll probably drag a game or two along for everyone that doesn't play Go
17:01:11 <SyntaxNinja> ndm: afaik, it gets the list of packages and matches against the ones it needs
17:01:23 <ndm> when I do Setup configure
17:01:25 <ndm> configure: Using hsc2hs: c:\ghc\ghc-6.4.2\bin\hsc2hs.exe
17:01:33 <ndm> thats for haddock, which has no use for hsc2hs
17:01:37 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, it checks for tools that are not needed
17:01:52 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, for dependent packages it's fine
17:02:07 * ndm is still learning Cabal
17:02:07 <shapr> greenrd: Well, probably chat and maybe code if people bring their laptops or whatever.
17:02:35 <tony2> I've been trying to teach my girlfriend to play Go. She doesn't get it.
17:02:37 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: ahh. idono, it's pretty hard to figure out which tools we need.
17:02:44 <Philippa_> there's a lot of Go to get
17:02:46 <greenrd> I should really get a laptop
17:02:51 <shapr> greenrd: At EuroHaskell 2004 we had a real academic get together, sort of...
17:02:55 * edwinb just got back from the Go club ;)
17:02:56 <shapr> I got John Hughes to try my unicycle.
17:02:56 <greenrd> unfortunately I'm always in debt these days
17:02:59 <SyntaxNinja> tony2: it's important to yell "there are only three rules!" while throwing the board across the room.
17:03:13 <Philippa_> greenrd: there's such a state as not being in debt?
17:03:17 <shapr> I like the Peyton-Jones Go quote...
17:03:17 <greenrd> hehe
17:03:26 <tony2> SyntaxNinja, she gets the rules, but is, well, shit at it.
17:03:31 <edwinb> shapr: me too, although I never completely understoof it...
17:03:37 <edwinb> understood, even
17:03:37 <yax1> tony2: i have the same problem
17:03:51 <shapr> edwinb: SPJ's daughter?
17:03:52 <SyntaxNinja> tony2: does she want to be good at it?
17:03:53 <edwinb> mmm
17:04:04 <Philippa_> SyntaxNinja: yeah. In a similar vein to "There's only three constructors and one reduction rule!"
17:04:14 <yax1> tony2: i gave my girlfriend a go board, thought it would be fun to learn together, she didn't win once
17:04:15 <tony2> SyntaxNinja, well yeah I think so.
17:04:29 <tony2> Chess was a non-starter
17:04:30 <SyntaxNinja> yax1: even w/ handicap?
17:04:30 <yax1> i think the problem is that programmers are good at go
17:04:33 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, I presume we can figure out which preprocessors are required
17:04:41 <shapr> edwinb: I think it's one of those piercing insights that kids occasionally have... Go really is a lot like FP imho.
17:04:48 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, eg happy, alex, cpphs, c2hs, hsc2hs
17:04:58 <yax1> SyntaxNinja: didn't try that
17:05:01 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah, you could. I'm not saying that it's not possible.
17:05:06 <SyntaxNinja> yax1: d'oh!
17:05:16 <edwinb> shaor: there are certainly similarities. As Philippa says, only three constructors and one reduction rule ;)
17:05:31 <yax1> goodnight
17:05:33 <SyntaxNinja> yax1: there's nothing more demoralizing than taking away all of someone's pieces.  the trick to teaching, IMO, is to let them almost win the first time, based on handicap
17:05:33 <Philippa_> yax1: that's... not a good idea. If nothing else, a handicap helps to start seeing some of the basic strategy
17:05:34 * edwinb curses his post-pub typing
17:05:48 <SyntaxNinja> then keep letting them win/ almost win, and the point gets to be reducing the handicap.
17:05:51 <yax1> SyntaxNinja: yes, but we were learning together, i hadn't played it before
17:05:58 <SyntaxNinja> ahh
17:06:03 <SyntaxNinja> that's tricky
17:06:09 <Philippa_> you'd done more reading?
17:06:22 <yax1> just the instructions
17:06:41 <SyntaxNinja> yax1: there's a really good go wiki.
17:07:22 <Philippa_> harder, but it's not uncommon for one person to learn faster
17:07:37 <Philippa_> and yeah, if SyntaxNinja's about to link to the wiki I think he is, it's good
17:07:48 <edwinb> I occasionally find British Go players with a secret interest in functional programming
17:07:50 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa_: I'm too lazy to link to it.
17:08:09 <edwinb> I went to a tournament last week, stayed in someone's spare room, and discovered he lurked on the haskell-prime list
17:08:20 <Philippa_> edwinb: met ccooke? Though it's not FP so much as esolangs he's interested in for the most part
17:08:27 <shapr> I think the trick to teaching is to get a bunch of beginner players together and make sure everybody gets to play with people near their skill level.
17:08:38 <edwinb> I've never met him, but I've seen him online, and I think he's an afper...
17:08:39 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: and unicycles.
17:08:47 <Philippa_> yeah, afp's where I know him from
17:08:55 <Philippa_> well, more #afp these days
17:09:03 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: I agree!
17:09:04 <edwinb> I went to afpmeets about five years ago...
17:09:35 <Philippa_> a couple of years before my time
17:09:56 <yax1> zzzzzzzzzzz
17:10:11 <shapr> It's like pair programming... you want some difference in the pair, but not so much that you can't communicate.
17:10:32 <tony2> I've never pair programmed.
17:10:39 <shapr> Come to AngloHaskell!
17:10:49 <shapr> Pair programming is an awesome experience imho
17:11:06 <shapr> Pair flow is totally different from single flow, and in many ways much better.
17:11:17 <tony2> I'd love too! But can't.
17:11:20 <shapr> Less intense, but easier to sustain and generally more productive.
17:11:25 <shapr> Anyway, sleep time for me.

17:12:39 <tony2> This weather is bad for my productivity.
17:13:26 <tony2> and my Bonsai tree doesn't seem to be enjoying it either.
17:14:02 <edwinb> My French office mate laughed at me for complaining about the heat...
17:17:57 <dibblego> I have been tasked with determining if pure functional programming is commcercially viable for producing software applications (such as web applications) over say Java (or Ruby or the other fancy ones) - it has been driven by my declaration that existing methodologies are flawed and a demonstrable proof - which most of my colleagues can now understand - given only a theoretical background in pure functional, I am a bit blind about f
17:17:57 <dibblego> oreseeing what I might discover in terms of being commercially viable - can anyone provide any insight?
17:18:00 <mwc> It was only 39C here today. Humidex brought it to 45, whatever that is
17:18:18 <mwc> dibblego, weren't you here posing this last night?
17:18:25 <dibblego> mwc, yes, I am persistent :)
17:18:33 <edwinb> 39C? I'd melt... I struggled with 24 today...
17:18:34 <dcoutts> cool! D-Bus bindings!
17:18:35 <dcoutts> http://neugierig.org/software/hdbus/
17:18:36 <lambdabot> Title: hdbus -- Haskell Bindings for DBus
17:19:18 <SyntaxNinja> dibblego: I work for a company that uses Haskell most of the time.
17:19:20 <dibblego> mwc, I still don't know if it will actually work - I'd like to know by utilising the experience of others if they'd like to share it
17:19:34 <mwc> dibblego, fwiw, in an applied mathematics simulation course, I did my projects in haskell while others used Matlab. Mine were routinely done sooner, had more functionality, and ran about an order of magnitude faster
17:19:34 <dibblego> SyntaxNinja, do you consult? sell your own product?
17:20:40 <SyntaxNinja> dibblego: consult.  www.galois.com
17:20:49 <dibblego> oh right, someone pointed me there
17:20:54 <SyntaxNinja> dibblego: there's also bluespec, aetion, and linspire which use Haskell.
17:21:06 <dibblego> righto, I'll take a look
17:21:24 <mwc> SyntaxNinja, I was pretty impressed with that linspire announcement
17:21:59 <SyntaxNinja> mwc: I was quite pleased too :)
17:22:26 <mwc> SyntaxNinja, from your page:
17:22:26 <mwc> The methods address the problems of developing high assurance systems through an iterative approach that applies mathematical formalisms across all phases of development.
17:22:38 <mwc> that's exactly the kind of consulting work I want to do
17:23:16 <mwc> mathematical formalism applied for industrial and commercial problems
17:24:45 <Spark> heh
17:26:26 <tony2> SyntaxNinja, what is Beaverton/Portland like? (I don't know much about USA geography)
17:29:43 <dcoutts> shapr, you wanted dbus bindings didn't you?
17:29:58 <dcoutts> shapr, perhaps you can comment on how we could improve the api
17:30:16 <dcoutts> if you've got any comments then send them to the gtk2hs-devel list
17:30:57 <SyntaxNinja> mwc: have you sent us your resume? :)
17:31:07 <mwc> SyntaxNinja, nah, just a lowly undegraduate
17:31:11 <mwc> Hiring interns?
17:32:10 <SyntaxNinja> mwc: possibly, though it's getting a bit late in summer for that.  we just hired our first intern, so we'll be doing more and more of that over the next few years, I expect.  we take people without PhDs despite anything our web page may imply :)
17:32:25 <Philippa_> heh
17:32:29 <ndm> SyntaxNinja: do you only have one intern?
17:32:35 <mwc> SyntaxNinja, where geographically are you based?
17:32:39 <ndm> the guy from York?
17:32:59 <SyntaxNinja> tony2: it's near seattle, so similar weather, mountains nearby, the coast is a few hours away.  near the columbia river.
17:33:06 <SyntaxNinja> west coast that is :)
17:33:08 <SyntaxNinja> ndm: right.
17:33:20 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, he's our first ever intern, I guess.
17:33:50 <mwc> SyntaxNinja, cool, I was looking into Graduate school at UBC (Vancouver) and SFU (Burnaby)
17:34:08 <SyntaxNinja> PSU does functional programming, and we do some work with them.
17:34:16 <lispy> using hsc2hs I've created a bunch of enums, how do i combine them (bitwise or)?
17:35:34 <mwc> lispy, doesn't it translate C enums to haskell datatypes as data myEnum = Enum1 | Enum2 ...
17:35:40 <mwc> I don't think you can.
17:35:42 <SyntaxNinja> portland people are really obsessed with the outdoors.
17:35:50 <SyntaxNinja> OSDL is here, ICFP is here this year, OSCON is here.
17:36:10 <lispy> mwc: it does something where it's able to assign them values out of the .h files
17:36:29 <mwc> lispy, yeah, I believe for the Enum class you provide a map between the constructors and integer values
17:37:31 <eivuokko> lispy, I usually just (+) them.  There is also Data.Bits for real bit ops.
17:38:15 <lispy> okay
17:38:18 <lispy> thanks
17:38:51 <eivuokko> With (+) you of course shouldn't accidentally set same bit twice..
17:38:55 <mwc> but what does the type look like for the haskell function? doFoo :: myEnum -> IO ()?
17:39:26 <mwc> or is it Int -> IO ()?
17:39:51 <lispy> in this case i think it's DWORD
17:39:55 <eivuokko> Because it is foreign language bindings, Int is likely.
17:40:07 <eivuokko> Yeah, for WinApi, DWORD.
17:40:13 <lispy> and i'm not sure what DWORD is, maybe Word64?
17:40:20 <eivuokko> Word32
17:40:26 <ndm> dcoutts: http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/PropLang
17:40:27 <lambdabot> Title: PropLang - HaskellWiki
17:40:50 <lispy> eivuokko: i'm able to popup openfile dialog boxes but manipulating them is pain
17:40:50 * dcoutts reads
17:41:05 <eivuokko> lispy, Heh
17:41:14 <ndm> dcoutts: very very rough ideas
17:41:33 <lispy> eivuokko: i created mkOPENFILENAME :: OPENFILENAME which is just an "empty" instance of the data type, then using record update syntax you can modify it to suite your needs
17:41:53 <lispy> but the hard part is that you have to use LPCSTR and the like to hold the filename
17:41:53 <mwc> looks like something to be built on top of gtk2hs
17:42:06 <dcoutts> mwc, that's the idea
17:42:11 <eivuokko> lispy, Over many ffi-calls?
17:42:23 <mwc> dcoutts, I think it should be done. With arrows. Just for the hell of it
17:42:29 <dcoutts> heh
17:42:30 <lispy> eivuokko: i don't understand
17:42:35 <mwc> I should go figure out how to generalize arrows to spears
17:42:46 <eivuokko> lispy, ie, can you use with-style functions for it?
17:42:48 <dcoutts> why stop there?
17:42:50 <ndm> mwc: make them more powerful, turn them into sub-machine guns
17:42:58 <lispy> nwc: i think arrows generalize to bullets or rockets
17:43:12 <lispy> eivuokko: with-style?
17:43:42 <eivuokko> lispy, Ffi functions that look like they were implemented with Control.Exception.bracket?
17:43:57 <eivuokko> lispy, ffi wrappers that is
17:44:11 <lispy> eivuokko: i'm in over my head...
17:44:18 <lispy> eivuokko: i have no idea what you're talking about :(
17:44:35 <lispy> i'm wondering if i should send you some code as an example of what i have
17:44:40 <dibblego> do most people use emacs for writing Haskell source files?
17:44:44 <eivuokko> @type alloca
17:44:45 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `alloca'
17:44:51 * dcoutts uses nedit
17:44:51 <eivuokko> @type Foreign.alloca
17:44:53 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Foreign.Storable.Storable a) => (GHC.Ptr.Ptr a -> IO b) -> IO b
17:44:57 <lispy> oh
17:45:09 <eivuokko> That is with-style, bracket-like whatever
17:45:32 <lispy> well, it wouldn't be that nice to use alloca because you have to stick the pointer into the struct, call the function then take a look at the pointer
17:45:34 <eivuokko> There are such marshalling funcs for strings, can you use them or do you need longer lifetime for the memory?
17:46:08 <lispy> also, does poke create a copy?
17:46:16 <eivuokko> Eh?
17:46:35 <lispy> let me show you the snippet
17:46:41 <eivuokko> Yes...poke does a copy.
17:46:55 <eivuokko> ...unless optimised heavily by ghc
17:47:05 <ndm> dcoutts: thoughts?
17:47:37 <lisppaste2> lispy pasted "does poke create a copy?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/22780
17:47:37 <ndm> its basically a half way house, still allows you to do stuff the old way with IO if you want
17:48:13 <lispy> eivuokko: in that function i poke away the value, call the function and then grab the value back...but i'm not sure if i need to grab it back
17:48:22 <mwc> Eh what? I just read a message by Daan Leijen where he said: "since monads are more general than arrows"
17:48:39 <mwc> that's a transposition error, right?
17:48:48 <ndm> i had always heard it the other way round
17:48:56 <eivuokko> lispy, it is not sensible wrapper imo, if you need to stuff LPCTSTR in OPENFILENAME
17:49:37 <eivuokko> lispy, I'd change the record in OPENFILENAME to String, make it non-Storable and write special withOPENFILENAME
17:49:50 <lispy> hmm
17:49:59 <eivuokko> (If I understood correctly, but I can't say because your paste don't show definition of OPENFILENAME)
17:50:38 <lisppaste2> lispy annotated #22780 with "OPENFILENAME" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/22780#1
17:50:53 <dcoutts> ndm, I was trying to find the code I hacked on, can't seem to find it
17:51:37 <eivuokko> lispy, Yeah.  That is very hard to use.  LPCTSTR would be better expressed with String or Maybe String.  It pays if you need to use those dialogs much.
17:52:39 <lispy> eivuokko: i think i need to keep the current structure (pehaps rename it) for internal module use
17:52:40 <ndm> lispy, or the null terminated bytestring library thingy, that should give you it easier
17:52:59 <eivuokko> lispy, That is one possibility.
17:53:02 <lispy> eivuokko: but yeah i was thinking i need a more haskelly version to expose
17:53:29 <lispy> eivuokko: then have an internal way of converting between the two representations
17:53:45 <eivuokko> lispy, But ime, writing withOPENFILENAME that has all the magic peek/poke inside is as easy as new hidden datatype and storable instance for it.
17:54:03 <lispy> also, _WIN32_WINNT doesn't seem to be >= 0x0500 which sort of surprised me
17:54:15 <eivuokko> It never is
17:54:24 <dcoutts> ndm, surely add notify should be: addNotify :: Var a -> (a -> IO ()) -> IO Notify
17:54:24 <eivuokko> That is programmer chosen constant
17:54:48 <ndm> dcoutts: certainly could be, although you can do that yourself
17:54:52 <lispy> eivuokko: wouldn't withOPENFILENAME have 20 parameters though?
17:55:00 <lispy> eivuokko: wouldn't that be sort of an unweildly function
17:55:01 <dcoutts> ndm, ah, with get
17:55:25 <ndm> indeed, but for most practical purposes, the a is probably a good idea
17:55:27 <eivuokko> lispy, Eh, no.  As I said, I'd have data = OPENFILENAME ... but with LPCTSTR as String or Maybe String
17:55:32 <ndm> easy enough to const out, harder to add back
17:55:33 <dcoutts> ndm, though if you get it with notify then you can do deltas
17:55:50 <eivuokko> lispy, withOPENFILENAME :: OPENFILENAME -> (Ptr OPENFILENAME -> IO b) -> IO b
17:56:06 <ndm> dcoutts: notifyDelta will probably be built on top of notify
17:56:14 <ndm> or as a primitive
17:56:19 <eivuokko> lispy, Probably you'd want something more elaborate if returns values are in that structure too.
17:56:29 <ndm> but the delta code is going to be a different path, probably
17:56:45 <lispy> eivuokko: what sort of function would you pass in?
17:57:00 <lispy> eivuokko: getOpenFile?
17:57:12 <lispy> er getOpenFileName i mean
17:57:18 <ndm> dcoutts: how hard would the - function be?
17:57:50 <eivuokko> lispy, Yeah, c_GetOPenFileName or something.
17:57:59 <dibblego> http://rafb.net/paste/results/nmeg5017.html this code is from a tutorial that briefly mentions monads and category theory - is this code actually use monads?
17:58:43 <dcoutts> ndm, not too hard once we extend properties with a little more info (it needs the name so we can connect to the right named gtk signal)
17:59:09 <dcoutts> ndm, I'm not sure I like (-) though :-)
17:59:10 <eivuokko> lispy, Maybe something like: withOFN ofn (\ofn -> do failIf_ c_GetOpenFileName ofn; (#peek OPENFILENAME.return_value) ofn)
17:59:18 <ndm> dcoutts: what do you like instead?
17:59:21 <lispy> eivuokko: so one other question, so say i change OPENFILENAME the way you say, then don't I still need a struct which physically matches the C struct for when I call c_GetOpenFileName?
17:59:23 <dcoutts> not sure
17:59:25 <ndm> i had ~ in for a while, but prefer -
17:59:37 <ndm> because in some fonts ~ floats to the top
17:59:52 <ndm> i know it means being an instance of num, and being utterly horrid though
18:00:02 <dcoutts> well it clashes with (-) of course
18:00:13 <ndm> yeah, but - is Num'd, so thats ok :)
18:00:17 <dcoutts> hah
18:00:25 <dcoutts> I don't think the names are the most important bit atm
18:00:26 <eivuokko> lispy, You can use hsc2hs: withOFN ofn act = alloca (#size OPENFILENAME) $ \buf -> do (#poke OFN.foo) foo ofn ... act
18:00:40 <ndm> agreed
18:00:58 <ndm> i might try and hack up that interface tomorrow, the low level bit, takes a bit of care, but not really that hard
18:01:07 <eivuokko> lispy, I might have crude typos and misspellings of omitted words there, just typing this here without testing.
18:01:10 <lispy> eivuokko: did you mean allocaBytes ?
18:01:16 <eivuokko> lispy, Yeah
18:01:59 <lispy> eivuokko: for some reason having the internal representation and then mapping to/from seems the easiest to understand
18:02:00 * SyntaxNinja home
18:02:04 <eivuokko> lispy, But I really need to sleep a bit, sorry.  If you get stuck or want comments, please mail me. ei - vuokko - info
18:02:05 <dibblego> ping? http://rafb.net/paste/results/nmeg5017.html does this use monads?
18:02:21 <lispy> eivuokko: thanks, yeah i need to leave work soon
18:02:21 <eivuokko> lispy, Yeah, sure.  If you think so, go for it :)
18:02:23 <sjanssen> dibblego: that uses the IO monad
18:02:30 <dibblego> sjanssen, cheers
18:02:50 <dibblego> is a monad somehow related to the 'do' keyword?
18:03:23 <ndm> dibblego: very much so, yes - do is syntactic sugar for monads
18:03:24 <sjanssen> dibblego: yeah, do is special syntax for writing monadic code
18:03:30 <dibblego> ok cheers
18:05:55 <LordBrain> if i mix do notation and the bind operator >>=, which has higher precedence, <- or >>= ?
18:06:48 <LordBrain> i'm looking at something like x <- y >>= z
18:06:52 <eivuokko> <- doesn't really have precedence.  So I guess answer would be >>= for reading.
18:07:04 <sjanssen> LordBrain: parses as x <- (y >>= z)
18:07:08 <LordBrain> ah
18:07:09 <LordBrain> thanks
18:13:02 <dcoutts> Igloo, don't you already deal with profiling variants of cabalised libs? it's not that hard is it?
18:13:37 <dcoutts> surely you just look for the *_p.a and *.p_hi files and put them in the profiling deb?
18:14:44 <vincenz> Grr
18:14:49 * vincenz sniffs
18:15:00 <vincenz> 3 hours of sleep
18:17:15 <vincenz> anyone know how long it takes to overcome jetlag?
18:27:41 <sm> vincenz: for me, usually a week
18:28:12 <vincenz> wow
18:35:42 * vincenz wonders if it's best to just lie in bed and try to catch some sleep or do something
18:37:21 <lispy> vincenz: i heard the trick was to stay up till it's the local bedtime then get some sleep
18:37:30 <vincenz> lispy: I did that
18:37:32 <lispy> never tried it though...
18:37:48 <lispy> vincenz: do it again? :)
18:37:51 <vincenz> 5 hours of sleep between monday and tuesday....(after 30 hours), 19 hour monday, went to bed at 11pm yesterday... it's 2am
18:38:00 <vincenz> ell I was up at 2am
18:38:04 <lispy> eh
18:38:05 <vincenz> it's now nearly 4am
18:38:10 <lispy> that sucks
18:38:13 <vincenz> yeah
18:38:26 <vincenz> I feel fatigued but my mind is lucid... like not drowsy or sleepy
18:38:42 <vincenz> just that I get that somewhat weird feeling in my head one gets with sleepderp
18:39:12 <vincenz> so a) read something b) just lie in bed and focus on breathing to recatch sleep..
18:39:26 <vincenz> (tho I tried that for a while and it wasn't working)
18:40:11 <vincenz> the b) that is
18:41:51 <vincenz> @localtime lispy
18:41:51 <lambdabot> Local time for lispy is Mon Jul 17 18:41:28 2006
18:42:55 <edwardk> heya dons
18:43:17 <dons> morning!
18:43:17 <lambdabot> dons: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
18:43:21 <dcoutts> morning dons
18:43:44 <dons> ?yow
18:43:45 <lambdabot> PEGGY FLEMMING is stealing BASKET BALLS to feed the babies in VERMONT.
18:44:23 <dcoutts> dons, got working readLStrUp & writeLStrUp
18:44:36 <dcoutts> they're suprisingly tricky
18:44:48 <edwardk> whats a good timing tool for haskell code?
18:44:57 <dons> dcoutts: cool!
18:45:07 * dcoutts pastes to #haskell-overflow
18:45:36 <vincenz> dons: got my message?
18:46:57 <vincenz> @wiki anglohaskell
18:46:57 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/anglohaskell
18:47:01 <dons> vincenz: i'm not sure why anf is not more widely used. its new? not many compilers have been written since the paper came out?
18:47:11 <vincenz> hmm
18:47:14 <vincenz> I looked around a bt, it's not that new
18:47:23 <vincenz> There's been some work on it here and there
18:47:23 <dons> well, the correspondence to ssa is
18:47:35 <vincenz> for instance AMr Samyr (if that is his name) 's thesis
18:47:37 <dons> people don't like fp langus?
18:47:41 * vincenz shrugs
18:47:55 <vincenz> the lexical scoping of ANF over the convoluted way of treating SSA with dags is definitely an advantage
18:48:17 <vincenz> so much easier to analyze when doing purely lexical scoping
18:48:57 <dons> yeah
18:49:01 <vincenz> anyways
18:49:04 <vincenz> regarding the alias analysing
18:49:04 <dons> ssa looks kind of crazy after seeing anf
18:49:15 <vincenz> imagine some code:
18:49:18 <vincenz> x = new a;
18:49:22 <vincenz> erm
18:49:27 <vincenz> x = new 1; x <- 2; !x
18:49:44 <vincenz> in let form: let x = new 1 in let _ = (<-) x 2 in (!) x
18:50:01 <vincenz> so without going into the references and treating them as plain old data. I could possibly make an anf form
18:50:09 <vincenz> but then you lose a lot of analysability
18:50:14 <vincenz> I wonder how feasible it is to do ANF -> ANF
18:50:20 <vincenz> where I do alias analysis and reference rmeoval
18:50:28 <vincenz> basically an ssafication of the code
18:50:37 <vincenz> (cause refferencces really are just modifiable variables)
18:50:44 <ozone> dons: don't underestimate the power of entrenchment :)  (re anf not being used vs ssa)
18:51:13 <dons> yeah, that's what I reckon
18:51:23 <vincenz> dons: so if you have any ideas on that
18:51:30 <dons> also, anyone using it has to port algorithms from ssa first
18:51:33 <ozone> ssa only got introduced into gcc with gcc 4, remember...
18:51:40 <vincenz> ozone: yep
18:51:44 <ozone> and it's been around for how long now?
18:52:05 <dons> right
18:52:46 <vincenz> ozone: end of 90's
18:53:04 <vincenz> Amr Sabry is a professor
18:53:11 <ozone> really?  I thought it was around for much longer
18:53:14 <vincenz> so I'm guessing he finished his phd somewhere end of 90's
18:53:24 <dons> ssa has been around since the 80s
18:53:31 <vincenz> only that short?
18:53:37 * vincenz ponders
18:53:55 <dons> maybe late 70s? 79 or something. but i've read papers from 83, 86
18:54:08 <vincenz> dons: well I think it existed when the bible of compilers came out
18:54:14 <vincenz> cause afaik they describe it
18:54:28 <vincenz> that bible is really impressive
18:54:31 <vincenz> they discuss type inference
18:54:37 <vincenz> and the book's what.. 30 years old or so?
18:55:35 <vincenz> nm
18:55:42 <vincenz> I'm wrong, sethi&ulman don't treat ssa
18:56:15 <dons> you forgot aho! ;)
18:56:25 <vincenz> right
18:56:36 <vincenz> dons: you forget I've slept 8 hours in the last 3-4 days
18:56:50 <LordBrain> hey... i notice that the configure script for fps looks for c2hs and cpphs, but doesnt mind that they are not present, would it be helpful if i installed those?
18:57:22 <dons> nope
18:57:35 <dons> just cabal being thorough
18:57:40 <LordBrain> ok
18:57:49 <vincenz> anyone know canadian local times?
18:58:58 <LordBrain> you can use tzselect
18:59:07 <AtnNn> eastern canada is same timezone as nyc, 22:00 atm
18:59:35 <SamB> @timefor SamB
18:59:36 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
18:59:41 <LordBrain> on debian (and probably similar platforms) just run tzselect at the prompt
18:59:42 <SamB> @localtime SamB
18:59:44 <lambdabot> Local time for SamB is Mon Jul 17 21:59:23
18:59:46 <vincenz> AtnNn: oh yeah, that I knkow, was in toronto saturday :)
18:59:51 <vincenz> I was curious about western canada
18:59:53 <vincenz> like victoria
19:00:07 <SamB> well, maybe it is 3 hours less
19:00:17 <SamB> like in california
19:00:28 <vincenz> > 4+12-7
19:00:29 <lambdabot>  9
19:00:29 <AtnNn> yeah, i think it's GMT-8
19:01:14 <vincenz> AtnNn: problem with GTM-x notation is that it's hard to tell time difffernece
19:01:18 <vincenz> you never know who's doing lightsavings
19:01:45 <vincenz> like yesterday someone told me that atm belgium is GMT+2, although I thought it was GMT+1....now GMT+2 - GMT-8 = 10, but I just checked a site, victoria is only 9 hours off
19:01:55 * vincenz hates doing time math
19:02:00 <AtnNn> oh, right
19:02:21 <SamB> well, anyway, I sure hope they use the same DST in canada as in the US, because it would be crazy if they didn't
19:02:32 <dylan> They don't any more! ;)
19:02:36 <vincenz> gotta say I love canada
19:02:43 <dylan> US DST lasts longer than Canadian now.
19:02:45 <LordBrain> dont forget daylight savings...
19:02:50 <SamB> DST is a PITA
19:02:55 <LordBrain> lol
19:02:57 <vincenz> dons: ping
19:03:17 <vincenz> dons: thoughts on alias analysis on ANF?
19:03:18 <dylan> the US is now in DST longer than any other country...
19:03:38 <LordBrain> probably should just abolish it...
19:03:40 <SamB> did they tell my computer?
19:03:40 <dibblego> from a tutorial: "We name the module “Main,” so that we can compile it." - shouldn't that be "so that we can execute it"?
19:03:47 <SamB> they really shouldn't be allowed to change that
19:03:55 <vincenz> dylan: well then their summer is "bigger" just like their cars, their army, their coutnry, and apparently even their genitals
19:04:02 <SamB> except if they want to abolish it
19:04:23 <SamB> when does our country get bigger anymore?
19:04:27 <vincenz> DST should not be abolished but standardized
19:04:37 <vincenz> SamB: I mean bigger than the rest of the world
19:04:43 <LordBrain> why not abolish?
19:04:44 <SamB> oh, that
19:04:45 <edwardk> hey. leave our genitals out of this ;)
19:04:56 <vincenz> LordBrain: cause otherwise you get fucked up winter days
19:04:59 <SamB> I don't think that any of our genitals are bigger than australia
19:05:05 <dylan> vincenz: don't confuse the US with Texas. ;)
19:05:09 <edwardk> yeah
19:05:14 <vincenz> :P
19:05:43 <LordBrain> well... we can start earlier in the winter without changing our clocks
19:06:17 * dylan lives nearer the equator than most, so thinks DST is really silly.
19:06:30 <vincenz> @whereat dylan
19:06:31 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: where where+
19:06:47 <LordBrain> @where dylan
19:06:47 <lambdabot> I know nothing about dylan.
19:06:57 <vincenz> LordBrain: there's no command for it
19:07:03 <dylan> well, Florida is a close approximation.
19:07:09 <LordBrain> i'm in florida also
19:07:13 <vincenz> dylan: cuba?
19:07:35 <LordBrain> he's in a boat
19:07:41 <LordBrain> :D
19:07:43 <sjanssen> gitmo?
19:07:44 <vincenz> how do you get internet on a boat
19:07:51 <LordBrain> satelite?
19:07:52 <dylan> no, no soy cubano.
19:08:13 <vincenz> LordBrain: hmm, I guess possibly
19:08:29 <vincenz> I think a cool idea would be global-wide mesh-wifi at x-hundred megabit
19:08:30 <LordBrain> i'm not sure.. but i think there is such a thing...
19:08:49 <LordBrain> as satelite internet
19:08:51 <vincenz> the new 802.1(something) will be wifi at 300Mb
19:09:08 <vincenz> or 600, can't remember
19:09:19 <vincenz> and there's another 802.1x that describes mesh
19:09:49 <vincenz> but 300Mb wifi is pretty impressive, that's faster than most good ethernet cards
19:09:52 <dylan> http://tinyurl.com/e62uh
19:09:54 <lambdabot> Title: Google Maps
19:10:12 <LordBrain> satelite internet probably isnt global tho.. so if you wonder off into some region of the ocean...
19:10:16 <vincenz> dylan: oh...you live there, sorry for mentioning genitals
19:10:38 <dylan> LOL
19:10:47 <vincenz> yeah florida kinda looks like..
19:11:06 <dylan> fractal penises...
19:11:19 <vincenz> @tell dons If you happen to have any idea on the alias analysis for ANF lemme know?/
19:11:19 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
19:11:19 <LordBrain> i'm in florida also
19:11:23 <vincenz> dylan: yeah
19:11:25 <dibblego> hello I am trying to do a tutorial, but the example won't compile - any tips? http://rafb.net/paste/results/1oRtMK82.html
19:11:36 <dylan> LordBrain: judging by IP, either north or south of me.
19:11:57 <LordBrain> north i think
19:12:11 <dibblego> everything is north or south of you, unless you stand on one of the poles :)
19:12:15 <LordBrain> you employed?
19:12:16 <vincenz> dibblego: make sure the putStrLn and the doGuessing start on the same column
19:12:37 <vincenz> they're not aligned
19:12:41 <dibblego> vincenz, that was the problem thanks
19:12:49 <dibblego> vincenz, how do I resolve the single quote issue?
19:12:54 <LordBrain> dylan, what company you work for? they need anyone?
19:12:57 <dibblego> "blah'blah" seems to be a problem
19:13:04 <vincenz> > "blab'blab"
19:13:05 <lambdabot>  "blab'blab"
19:13:07 <vincenz> works fine
19:13:09 <vincenz> > "blab`blab"
19:13:11 <lambdabot>  "blab`blab"
19:13:13 <vincenz> that too
19:13:18 <Cale> dibblego: that character you put in isn't in ASCII
19:13:22 <dibblego> oh
19:13:31 <Cale> dibblego: the GHC lexer in 6.4.2 doesn't like unicode.
19:13:32 <dylan> LordBrain: I'm not exactly gainfully employed. I'm guessing you live near Orlando.
19:13:40 <Cale> dibblego: 6.6 will though
19:13:43 <dibblego> Cale, ok, I just copied it out of the PDF
19:13:48 <Cale> ah
19:13:49 <LordBrain> well i can drive to orlando.. i'm north of there
19:13:52 <vincenz> dibblego: yeah copying quotes out of pdf sucks
19:14:00 <LordBrain> closer to sanford
19:14:02 <vincenz> dibblego: usually it fucks up " as well, giving you the slanted ones
19:14:04 <dylan> Ah, you're a mainlander.
19:14:10 <LordBrain> yeah
19:14:13 * dylan is in the tampa-bay area.
19:14:24 <LordBrain> i see
19:14:53 <dylan> The rest of florida is sort of in the sphere of "strange place", really. Not sure where anything is beyond Orlando.
19:15:58 <dylan> LordBrain: You looking for work?
19:16:02 <LordBrain> yeah
19:16:14 <dylan> Yep, you're definitely a programmer living in Florida...
19:16:18 <LordBrain> lol
19:17:44 <vincenz> @bot
19:17:45 * vincenz pokes lambdabot 
19:17:45 <lambdabot> :)
19:18:52 <Korollary> hah
19:18:53 <dibblego> is lambdabot like ghci?
19:19:15 <vincenz> dibblego: as much as a lada is like a porshe
19:19:16 <SamB_XP> Prelude> putStrLn "Hello, world!"
19:19:23 <SamB_XP> what is a lada?
19:19:31 <Korollary> It's a russian car afaik
19:19:39 <SamB_XP> > "Hello, world!"
19:19:40 <lambdabot>  "Hello, world!"
19:19:49 <dibblego> an Italian car, haven't seen one in years
19:20:26 <Korollary> It's russian
19:21:01 <dibblego> oh
19:21:45 <Korollary> lambdabot has a restricted haskell interpreter and a lot of other ircbot thingies
19:21:47 <dibblego> I knew it was somewhere north :)
19:25:16 <vincenz> what's an open proxy scanner?
19:25:53 <dons> dylan: i think vincenz came from OCaml, if you have any queries about convering from OCaml to Haskell (you're the guy, right?)
19:25:59 <dons> converting
19:28:00 <vincenz> dons: I take it you don't know about alias analysis either?
19:28:48 <LordBrain> ocaml was my first introduction to functional programming
19:28:58 <LordBrain> then i went scheme... then haskell
19:29:11 <vincenz> LordBrain: just like me
19:29:24 <vincenz> well sccheme was a parallel side-track
19:29:33 <vincenz> I jumped ship straight from o'caml to haskell
19:29:38 <vincenz> after getting frustrated with o'caml
19:31:03 <dons> vincenz: i rememeber alias analysis is a pain in the butt
19:31:15 <vincenz> damn
19:31:19 <vincenz> well I need to do it
19:31:27 <vincenz> so I'd love any references you have on that
19:31:34 <vincenz> fortunately my reference are rather simple
19:31:38 <vincenz> reference-structures
19:31:44 <vincenz> no recursive types or anything like that
19:32:00 <vincenz> so that alleviates some of the issues
19:32:06 <vincenz> I mostly just use them to create mutable variables
19:32:10 <vincenz> in a type-safe way
19:32:26 <vincenz> and of course they have to be weeded out to see the true data-dependence flow
19:33:45 <vincenz> any information you might have on that would be terribly useful for me
19:37:19 <dons> there should be a way to convert alias -analysis over ssa to anf, is that's what you're lookin gat
19:37:33 <dons> otherwise, just grab muchnik's advanced compilers book
19:37:45 * dons looks for muchnik
19:38:34 <vincenz> I got muchnick at work... The issue is that I already start with a functional from so I'd prefer not going to SSA but sticking to the form (but normalizing it to ANF)
19:38:39 <vincenz> simple example:
19:38:41 <dons> ch. 10, p 293-318, Alias Analysis :)
19:38:49 <vincenz> x = new 1; x <- 2; !x translates to anf:
19:39:00 <vincenz> let x = new 1 in let _ = (<-) x 2 in read x
19:39:08 <vincenz> but here the data dependence is hidden
19:39:18 <dons> no, but i don't know of any anf work on this. other than the anf paper i already cited. so you'd have to either work out an encoding in anf, or convert an existing ssa algorithm to anf
19:39:19 <vincenz> so ideally
19:39:20 <vincenz> you'd get
19:39:24 <vincenz> let x' = 1 in x
19:39:43 <vincenz> dons: tha anf paper you cited being ckz03?
19:40:04 <vincenz> I guess I could try adapting an ssa algo
19:40:12 <dons> yep.
19:40:25 <vincenz> it's just silly cause my original ANF encodes an SSA with no mutable variables
19:40:28 <vincenz> all variables are let-bound
19:40:44 <vincenz> only after weeding out the functions that work with references do I get something more realistic
19:45:20 <dylan> dons: yeah, I talked to vincenz a bit already
19:45:26 <dylan> I remember vincenz from #ocaml too.
19:45:48 <vincenz> yah
19:45:48 <dons> ah, cool
19:45:57 <vincenz> a certain harsh member of the ocaml community led me to no longer idle in #ocaml
19:45:59 * dylan is about the only person that answers questions in ocaml.
19:46:01 <vincenz> the channel was very quiet anyways
19:46:11 <vincenz> dylan: yeah the community is rather dead :(
19:46:22 <vincenz> dylan: another reason I idled in #haskell even before I knew haskell, great community
19:46:24 <dons> any theories why?
19:46:37 <dons> since there's supposed to be such a large number of users
19:46:59 <vincenz> dons: well for one, there's this grad student who acts with an air of superiority and who always points some small fallacies in a question you might ask instead of answering the obvious case
19:47:17 <dons> oh, i think dylan described something like that !
19:47:23 <dylan> yes.
19:47:28 <vincenz> and pretty much beats newbies into fear with eyebrowing
19:47:35 <vincenz> so that sort of silences the channel a lot
19:47:44 <dons> scary. its weird how a culture emerges in a project
19:47:52 <dylan> He also thinks I'm impossible. XD
19:47:56 <vincenz> dons: the annoying bit is that he's not even related to ocaml
19:48:02 <vincenz> dons: he works on typed assembly afaik
19:48:21 <dylan> vincenz: don't forget his typed web application meta-programming language...
19:48:25 <dons> we've taken action once, iirc, against someone who hassled newbies here
19:48:33 <glguy> Are there any IDEs or other environments that would run on OS X like Visual Haskell for Windows?
19:48:47 <dons> which was probably a good idea, in hindsight, considering the effect on #ocaml then
19:48:49 <vincenz> dylan: well he might use ocaml, tho that doesn't make him part of the source
19:49:02 <dylan> dons: this person seems to believe there is only one way to learn something, and he thinks I am lying when I say I learned ocaml by reading the standard library.
19:49:04 <vincenz> dons: well the other issue is that the channel is always impossibly silent
19:49:07 <dons> glguy: hmm, a lot of people seem to use emacs
19:49:10 <LordBrain> i use vim as my ide
19:49:23 <dons> @seen ozone
19:49:24 <lambdabot> ozone is in #haskell. I last heard ozone speak 56 minutes and 13 seconds ago.
19:49:31 <glguy> I've been writing my toy programs in vim so far, I didn't know if there was something better
19:49:31 <vincenz> dylan: I think this person believes there's only one way to do a lot of things, the way he says
19:49:32 <dons> ozone? ides for the mac?
19:49:40 <dons> i use vim
19:49:47 <vincenz> dons: 7?
19:49:48 <dons> probably 85% of this channel uses either vim or emacs
19:49:49 <vincenz> dons: it's got tabs!
19:50:07 <dons> 7?
19:50:09 <dons> ?
19:50:09 <vincenz> vim 7
19:50:14 <dons> ah, no, still 6
19:50:16 <vincenz> it's out since a cople of weeks
19:50:17 <dons> should i update?
19:50:20 <dons> yeah, i saw
19:50:21 <vincenz> definitely
19:50:22 <vincenz> serious overhaul
19:50:28 <dons> ooh. ok. goodness!
19:50:36 <vincenz> plus word-comlpetion that's cross all the files that are open
19:50:46 <vincenz> and a system to make more complex completion
19:50:58 <vincenz> be great if we can tie it into GHCi somehow to get a listing of all imported names
19:50:58 <dons> oh, i thought we already had word completion across open files
19:51:03 <dons> (or is it just visible buffers)
19:51:05 <LordBrain> hmm has its own spell checking
19:51:09 <vincenz> dons: oh I didn't know that
19:51:20 <LordBrain> i'm using vim 6 too
19:51:34 <dons> glguy: i'd say, try vim or emacs. that seems to be what all the good hackers i know use
19:51:42 <glguy> I'll stick with vim then
19:51:45 <vincenz> dons: there's also another way of doing completion by defining a certain function... just like originally indent could be completely customized... be really cool if that can be done with the std-library or using hoogle or so
19:52:08 <dons> glguy: just learn it really well -- you'll be spending 40 hours a week in it, so its worth optimising your usage :)
19:52:17 <dons> vincenz: hmm.!
19:52:27 <dons> we _really_ need to work on the haskell binding
19:52:31 <glguy> dons: I'm actually pretty good in vim, I use it for everything I can
19:52:34 <vincenz> dons: would be even better if you can hoogle on the fly to get project-related completion
19:53:01 <vincenz> based on import
19:53:12 <LordBrain> yeah the haskell binding needs some work
19:53:28 <vincenz> dons: oh yeah and vim7 has a new internal language
19:53:40 <dons> ah, very very interesting.
19:53:42 <dons> no more vimscript?
19:53:42 <vincenz> that has lists and other higher data structures
19:53:48 <vincenz> it's called vimL
19:53:52 <vincenz> it's a rehaul of vimscript
19:53:58 <dons> LordBrain: i was thinking more of a binding to haskell, a la the perl binding
19:54:05 <dons> so you can write vim scripts in haskell
19:54:07 <vincenz> actually remember talking to bram about that a year ago or so, there was a lot of cacndy being added
19:54:12 <dons> i.e. like an indenter
19:54:20 <LordBrain> ooooooh
19:54:32 <vincenz> dons: or stage1 of ghc :D
19:54:35 <dons> if they can bind to perl, we can surely bind to haskell.
19:54:48 <vincenz> dons: at which point we can do AST manipulation
19:54:49 <dons> since we have an ffi, that's rather nice
19:55:03 <LordBrain> that would be cool, but i actually meant the ftplugin.. its syntax highlighting and support for layout awareness
19:55:22 <vincenz> LordBrain: ftplugin are just vim files, so any binding that vim has can be used in it
19:55:31 <vincenz> such as mzschceme or perl or python
19:55:35 <vincenz> or ruby
19:55:40 <dons> ah, looks like vim 7 has hit the openbsd servers, DISTNAME=       vim-7.0
19:55:42 <dons> :)
19:56:10 <vincenz> yeah, ubuntu dapper doesn't have it (shame really cause dapper came out not so long before vim7, they could've added it)
19:56:39 <vincenz> gvim
19:56:46 <glguy> vim is in darwin ports as well (but the OS X 10.4.7 version is still 6.2)
19:56:51 <glguy> vim7.0 that is
19:57:10 <vincenz> dons: once you have vim77
19:57:32 <vincenz> :help new-omni-completion
19:57:49 <vincenz> wow...apparently it's even context sensitive
19:57:58 <vincenz> imagine using a type checcker to reduce the possibilities!
19:58:19 <dylan> it's not just context sensitive.
19:58:20 <vincenz> just load AST into ghci.... inform the current position we're trying to insert...
19:58:27 <dylan> for python, it'll lookup which methods are invokable, etc.
19:58:28 <LordBrain> what is omni completion?
19:58:38 <vincenz> This could also be called "intellisense", but that is a trademark.  It is a
19:58:38 <vincenz> smart kind of completion.  The text in front of the cursor is inspected to
19:58:38 <vincenz> figure out what could be following.  This may suggest struct and class
19:58:38 <vincenz> members, system functions, etc.
19:58:57 <vincenz> You can add your own omni completion scripts.
19:59:06 <LordBrain> oh
19:59:17 <vincenz> so yeah...you can go as crazy as you want
19:59:20 <vincenz> Hare in vim anyone?
19:59:22 <LordBrain> i've made a lot of use of ctrl-n and ctrl-p
20:00:09 <dylan> vincenz: haha, my stats remember you. http://hardison.net/stats/ocaml-alltime.html
20:00:10 <lambdabot> Title: #ocaml @ freenode stats by dylan
20:00:29 <vincenz> dylan: woot
20:00:47 <dons> reminds me, we should make stats of #haskell at some point (like was done recenty for the haskell-prime list)
20:00:51 <vincenz> I remember that site :
20:01:03 <dons> oh, you've got Smerdyakov now?
20:01:13 <vincenz> dons: that's the one we were referring to earlier...
20:01:15 <dons> he's the guy who used to hassle newbies that we kicked out..
20:01:23 <dons> cause he killed the community vibe
20:01:24 <dylan> he's been in there as long as I can remember.
20:01:25 <vincenz> he's the ocaml prick
20:01:39 <dylan> he's not really an ocaml programmer, but an SML one
20:01:41 <vincenz> dons: so I guess now you get a betterp icture
20:01:46 <dons> just ask shapr about what happened a few years ago, i think he was the first person we banned.
20:01:52 <dylan> he only likes ocaml because of Coq. He's also chanserv op of #ocaml.
20:01:55 <foxy_> dons, I think the Yi+GTK implementation should separate  buffer from window (one reason is to support doc/view paradigm)
20:01:56 <vincenz> dylan: yeah, always bitches about sml being better than ocaml in #ocaml
20:02:14 <vincenz> dons: well he's the person we referred to earlier when talking about a certain someone in #ocaml
20:02:22 <dons> foxy_: i'm happy for you to go nuts in yi+gtk. if you think that would be better, hack away!
20:02:29 <foxy_> :)
20:03:08 <dons> dylan: how'd you do the stats? could we collect the same for #haskell?
20:03:17 <vincenz> dons: lambdabot plugin!
20:03:23 <dylan> dons: irssi logs + pisq
20:03:26 <dylan> err, pisg.
20:03:27 <dons> yeah, well lambdabot has all the logs.
20:03:39 <dylan> pisg works with multiple formats, though.
20:03:47 <dons> ok
20:03:48 <vincenz> @google pisg
20:03:48 <dylan> Something in haskell would be a lot nicer.
20:03:49 <lambdabot> http://pisg.sourceforge.net/
20:03:49 <lambdabot> Title: pisg - Perl IRC Statistics Generator
20:03:57 <dons> ah, cool
20:04:02 <dylan> pisg is not even perl5-style perl, IIRC.
20:04:02 <vincenz> dylan: or for the time being, invoke from haskell with system
20:04:26 <vincenz> dylan: is it a big piece of code?
20:04:58 <dylan> the executable is 136 lines... the modules it uses...
20:05:33 <dylan> % cat `locate Pisg|grep pm` | wc -l
20:05:33 <dylan> 8567
20:05:36 <vincenz> I guess someone with perl knowledge should be able to easily port it
20:05:50 <dons> i notice they don't support lambdabot log file format :/
20:05:51 <dylan> someone with perl and haskell knowledge.
20:05:54 <dons> ;)
20:05:58 <vincenz> dons: well port the logic....
20:06:10 <vincenz> dylan: well haskell was implicitly assumed :)
20:06:13 <dons> just teasing. we use the same as clog/meme
20:06:52 <dylan> use hs-plugins for handling different log file formats, please. :)
20:07:00 <vincenz> dylan: anything happen post 3.09.2?   or the extlib?  I remember sending some patches to extlib... but there was no updates
20:07:15 <dylan> extlib was updated in April I think.
20:07:24 * vincenz wonders if they incorporated his stuff
20:07:31 <dylan> Inria updates ocaml every 6 months
20:07:59 <vincenz> dylan: yeah but I wouldn't really call them big overhauls
20:08:33 <dylan> I don't see much to do with the core language right now.
20:08:41 * vincenz nods
20:08:45 <dylan> the community is what needs upgrading, but that ain't happening.
20:08:58 <vincenz> yeah it's stuck in a zone of backwards compatible stability
20:09:20 <dylan> well, all the ocaml people are more interested in coq.
20:09:29 <dylan> and using coq to generate ocaml code.
20:09:34 * vincenz ponders
20:10:03 <vincenz> they risk losing it tho... if they keep going like this, someoen's bound to port coq to haskell, a communit which has as original focus compilers and hence does not sit still
20:10:39 <vincenz> I guess the haskell situation should be named "bootstrapping research"
20:11:22 <dylan> "22:15 <Smerdyakov> I hope that something more like Coq will be the successor to OCaml and Haskell. :)"
20:11:45 <dylan> ^ I've heard the same sentiment on mailing lists, etc.
20:11:46 <vincenz> lol
20:11:57 <vincenz> dylan: I think it depends on your goal
20:12:21 <vincenz> I doubt that's feasible with the direction haskell is going
20:12:38 <dons> vincenz: why so?
20:12:47 <dons> there's a fair bit of work on writing theorem provers in haskell
20:12:59 <vincenz> dons: well cause coq is prolly great to do very complex stuff but will most likely not be a good language to write stuff in that needs to interfacec with other stuff
20:13:02 <LordBrain> what's Coq?
20:13:17 <vincenz> dons: I think the statement referred more to using coq instead of haskell and ocaml as pl
20:13:29 <dons> ah, yes, so the question of whether a threom prover is a good place to write code is still not answerred.
20:13:30 <vincenz> LordBrain: rooster
20:13:49 <vincenz> dons: I have limited knowledge of theorem provers, but my gut instinct says no
20:14:57 <dylan> one gets the feeling the only reason for ocaml and camlp4 was the creation of coq.
20:15:09 <vincenz> dylan: yeah I agree
20:15:25 <vincenz> dylan: that was a bit my point when I said that haskell had different motivations, aka compilers
20:15:48 <dylan> and DSELs.
20:16:07 <vincenz> dylan: yeah...been wondering about that, do you think dsels are as possible in ocaml?
20:16:12 * vincenz doesn't
20:17:00 <dylan> vincenz: they are, in fact. That is what camlp4 is.
20:17:07 <vincenz> oh right
20:17:10 <vincenz> but not straight caml
20:17:37 <vincenz> I think you need lazyness for it to work... as well as monadic stuff
20:17:52 <vincenz> otherwise you can't define new flow structures
20:18:15 <dylan> there are slides for making a DSL for makefiles using camlp4
20:18:51 <dylan> e.g. you write what looks like a makefile, but it is turned into ocaml code, with type checking and such.
20:19:12 <vincenz> dylan: right but... I mean you can't just do dsel's in pure ocacml
20:19:17 <dylan> vincenz: parser combinators exist for ocaml, too
20:19:22 <vincenz> dylan: and not to be a troll, but camlp4 is a b*tch to use
20:19:33 <vincenz> dylan: yeah but I heard there were some issues with that
20:19:42 <vincenz> like having to do eta-expansion which uglifies code
20:19:44 <vincenz> or some such
20:19:56 * vincenz can't remember exactly
20:20:27 <dylan> vincenz: I've tried to use camlp4, I know.
20:20:54 <dylan> it'd be hard to find a corner of ocaml that I haven't used.
20:21:11 <vincenz> dylan: my main reasons for moving, however, were typeclasses and the facct that data-constructors are not firsclass, my main reasons for staying, monads and laziness
20:21:25 <vincenz> dylan: same applies to me if you leave out the camlp4 stuff
20:21:31 <vincenz> in fact
20:21:48 <vincenz> I even sponsorize ocaml in the paper I presented last week in toronto :)
20:21:53 <SamB_XP> vincenz: you wouldn't have monads without typeclasses ;-)
20:22:01 <vincenz> SamB_XP: I know
20:22:22 <vincenz> :)
20:22:23 <dylan> vincenz: by data constructors being first class, do you mean they can be curried?
20:22:31 <SamB_XP> well, I mean, you could use them but it would be AWFUL
20:22:46 <vincenz> dons: another cool feature: undo trees instead of lists in vim7
20:22:50 * dylan implemented monads in ocaml. Ouch
20:22:50 <vincenz> dylan: well yeah
20:22:59 <vincenz> dylan: how did you do that? functors?
20:23:02 <SamB_XP> was there haskell before typeclasses?
20:23:12 <vincenz> SamB_XP: was there typeclasses before haskell?
20:23:35 <SamB_XP> don't think so
20:23:49 <vincenz> me neither
20:24:04 <Korollary> no. Wadler conjured them up for haskell.
20:24:14 <vincenz> I wonder what haskell looked like without TCs
20:24:19 <SamB_XP> but, did he conjure them up at the very beginning or later?
20:24:31 <Korollary> early on
20:24:49 <vincenz> dons: :help new-undo-branches
20:24:50 <SamB_XP> can't imagine anyone actually used it before that
20:24:53 <Korollary> I was reading that history of haskell paper
20:24:57 <dons> in the first year or two, when there were 12 users
20:24:57 <Korollary> it's in there
20:25:09 <SamB_XP> maybe they were more like "players"
20:25:17 <dons> and you still had to write to yale to get a copy of the yale compiler
20:25:18 <SamB_XP> or "players-with"
20:27:48 <vincenz> ooooooooooh
20:27:57 <vincenz> you can do a mapping operator in vim7
20:28:01 <vincenz> someone tie it to hare?/
20:29:09 <haskey> how do I increase the heap size on Windows (for ghci)?
20:32:37 <dibblego> does anyone here own the tutorial.pdf? I am reading all the way through it and find minor grammatical errors - I'll fix them if you like
20:32:54 <haskey> dibblego
20:33:00 <vincenz> dibblego: tutorial pdf is rather generic
20:33:18 <haskey> I believe was written by a non native speaker
20:33:35 <haskey> you mean the Yet another haskell tutorial by Hal
20:33:36 <dibblego> I can't find where I downloaded it from
20:33:51 <dibblego> yes
20:33:56 <vincenz> haskey: sure it's yaht
20:34:01 <vincenz> afaik yaht is ccalled yaht.pdf
20:34:05 <vincenz> @where yaht
20:34:06 <lambdabot> http://www.isi.edu/%7Ehdaume/htut/
20:34:11 <haskey> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/tutorial.pdf
20:34:14 <vincenz> ah
20:34:38 <haskey> lambdabot never ceases to amaze me
20:34:56 <vincenz> haskey: @where = user-defined
20:35:04 <vincenz> @where+ vincenz http://notvincenz.com/
20:35:04 <lambdabot> Done.
20:35:08 <vincenz> @where vincenz
20:35:08 <lambdabot> http://notvincenz.com/
20:35:27 <haskey> @where+ ruby http://ruby-lang.org
20:35:28 <lambdabot> Done.
20:35:32 <haskey> @where ruby
20:35:32 <lambdabot> http://ruby-lang.org
20:35:35 <haskey> cool
20:36:14 <haskey> how long does it keep does variables? are those stored on a file or lost in the next restart?
20:36:38 <dibblego> well, if Hal is around and needs a proof reader, I don't mind returning the favour
20:36:38 <haskey> those.. sorry
20:37:32 <haskey> also, Vincent do you know how to increase ghci heap?
20:37:37 <vincenz> haskey: no idea
20:37:52 <vincenz> ghc +RTS something -RTS
20:38:08 <int-e> +RTS --help tells you a bunch of options
20:38:33 <vincenz> int-e: yeah and it's not to stdout so you can't less it
20:38:47 <int-e> in bash, add   2>&1 | less
20:39:14 <SamB_XP> haskey: they are supposed to be in a file
20:39:22 <SamB_XP> the @where locations
20:39:30 <SamB_XP> but sometimes dons has troubles
20:39:37 <dibblego> This is possible because tail has a polymorphic type: [α] → [α]
20:39:49 <dibblego> what does that last little piece of mathematical symbols mean?
20:40:10 <int-e> [a] -> [a]
20:40:10 <vincenz> dibblego: neat font :)
20:40:38 <haskey> how do I get the last element of a list without reversing it?
20:40:45 <glguy> last
20:40:46 <vincenz> > last [1..10]
20:40:47 <lambdabot>  10
20:40:54 <vincenz> > tails [1..10]
20:40:55 <lambdabot>  [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[4,5,6,7,8,9...
20:41:00 <vincenz> > last $ tails [1..10]
20:41:02 <lambdabot>  []
20:41:08 <haskey> yep Iknew tail and head, but not last
20:41:11 <haskey> groovy
20:41:15 <vincenz> tails not tail :)
20:41:15 <glguy> > init [1,2,3]
20:41:16 <lambdabot>  [1,2]
20:41:31 <vincenz> > inits [1..3]
20:41:32 <lambdabot>  [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]
20:41:49 <vincenz> and now for the cool function I like so much
20:41:52 <int-e> note that inits is quite inefficient, O(n^2) where n is the list length.
20:42:00 <vincenz> int-e: obviously :)
20:42:12 <int-e> tails is O(n) :)
20:43:28 <haskey> ok this seems odd to me. I know about the arithmetic precision issues common in all the languages, but this result is really weird:
20:43:31 <vincenz> > let mkVars i o =  let vars = i ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, o]) in vars in mkVars (map return ['a'..'z']) (map return ['0'..'9'])
20:43:32 <lambdabot>  ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s"...
20:43:38 <vincenz> > drop 1000 $ let mkVars i o =  let vars = i ++ (map concat . sequence $ [vars, o]) in vars in mkVars (map return ['a'..'z']) (map return ['0'..'9'])
20:43:39 <lambdabot>  ["h14","h15","h16","h17","h18","h19","h20","h21","h22","h23","h24","h25","h2...
20:43:46 <haskey> > last [0,0.001..100000]
20:43:50 <lambdabot> Terminated
20:43:56 <haskey> > last [0,0.001..10000
20:43:56 <lambdabot>  Parse error
20:44:00 <haskey> > last [0,0.001..10000]
20:44:04 <lambdabot> Terminated
20:44:09 <haskey> > last [0,0.001..100]
20:44:10 <lambdabot>  100.00000000011343
20:44:18 <vincenz> haskey: oh yeah... rounding errors
20:44:29 <vincenz> haskey: anyways it stops as soon as the last element is bigger than the last one you wrote
20:44:36 <vincenz> > last [0,0.1..1]
20:44:37 <lambdabot>  0.9999999999999999
20:44:42 <vincenz> or wait
20:44:48 <int-e> > [1,3..6]
20:44:49 <lambdabot>  [1,3,5]
20:44:50 <vincenz> as soon as it's bigger than 0.5*step more
20:44:50 <sjanssen> the Enum instance for Double is a bit nasty, you probably shouldn't use it
20:45:02 <vincenz> > [1,2..4.5]
20:45:03 <lambdabot>  [1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0]
20:45:13 <int-e> > [1,5..8]
20:45:14 <lambdabot>  [1,5]
20:45:22 <vincenz> > [1,5..7]
20:45:23 <lambdabot>  [1,5]
20:45:28 <vincenz> > [1,5..9]
20:45:29 <lambdabot>  [1,5,9]
20:45:38 <vincenz> funky
20:45:58 <vincenz> > [1,6..9]
20:45:59 <lambdabot>  [1,6]
20:46:08 <vincenz> > [1,6..10]
20:46:09 <lambdabot>  [1,6]
20:46:10 <haskey> ok but I'm not too worried because this is true for all languages
20:46:11 <vincenz> > [1,6..11]
20:46:12 <lambdabot>  [1,6,11]
20:46:17 <dons> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/haskell.html
20:46:18 <lambdabot> Title: #haskell @ freenode stats by dons
20:46:38 <vincenz> @karma+ dons
20:46:38 <lambdabot> dons's karma raised to 40.
20:46:48 <vincenz> dons: now we'll really see how much time I waste in this channel :P
20:47:01 <dons> it's a bit scary actually
20:47:05 <vincenz> yeah
20:47:33 <dons> not sure why the graphs didn't get rendered. hmm
20:47:33 <vincenz> lol
20:47:34 <vincenz> dons spoke a total of 48010 words!
20:47:35 <vincenz> dons's faithful follower, dmhouse, didn't speak so much: 35606 words.
20:47:44 <dons> :S
20:47:57 <vincenz> vincenz talks to him/herself a lot. He/She wrote over 5 lines in a row 77 times!
20:48:00 <vincenz> Another lonely one was dons, who managed to hit 70 times.
20:48:12 <haskey> how do I register a nickname in irc?
20:48:19 <vincenz> haskey: /msg NickServ help
20:48:21 <int-e> most used word ... ACTION
20:48:24 <int-e> that's silly :)
20:48:33 <vincenz> int-e: that's a feature not a bug
20:48:47 <ptolomy> what are y'all using as a haskell editor on mac OS X?
20:49:00 <dons> that's a feature. since our log format isn't quite the same as what pisg was expecting
20:49:03 * jer uses textmate
20:49:05 <sjanssen> ptolomy: vim
20:49:11 <vincenz> dons: do the other days as well?
20:49:20 <vincenz> dons: tho I'll most likely have crappy statisticics due to my week in toronto
20:49:21 <ptolomy> sjanssen: Console or gui?
20:49:33 <sjanssen> ptolomy: GUI, though it kinda sucks
20:49:42 <dons> this is over the last 40 dyas
20:49:45 <int-e> > last $ takeWhile (<=100) $ iterate (+0.001) 0
20:49:46 <lambdabot>  99.99900000011343
20:49:58 <vincenz> dons: I thought it was a daily
20:50:05 <dibblego> ptolomy, I use jedit on Linux - I'd use it on MacOS as well
20:50:18 * ptolomy downloads.
20:50:20 <vincenz> oh nm
20:50:29 <vincenz> sjanssen: try vim7
20:50:36 <vincenz> sjanssen: it's got a lot of nifty features
20:51:07 <vincenz> dons: if that's the last 40 days then it's even more scary as I was gone for a week
20:51:22 <sjanssen> vincenz: haven't gotten round to it yet.  Bet they haven't fixed the OS X GUI though
20:51:30 <vincenz> > 4182/33*40
20:51:30 <lambdabot>  5069.090909090909
20:51:46 <vincenz> sjanssen: oh it's a mac-porting crapability
20:52:09 <vincenz> > 4182/31*40
20:52:10 <lambdabot>  5396.129032258064
20:54:29 <vincenz> well....it's getting morning (6am), I guess I better propagate the insomnia and head to work
20:54:38 * vincenz waves
20:57:34 <haskey> other quick question
20:58:01 <haskey> how do I get the n-th element in a list?
20:58:26 <int-e> > [2,3,5,7] !! 2
20:58:27 <lambdabot>  5
20:58:41 <haskey> > [1,2,3,4,5] !! 1
20:58:42 <lambdabot>  2
20:58:44 <haskey> cool
20:58:48 <haskey> like arrays
20:58:52 <haskey> just with !!
20:59:13 <mlh> is that O(1) ?
20:59:13 <int-e> but less efficient
20:59:41 <int-e> no, (!! n) walks a linked list down n steps - it's O(n).
21:00:10 <haskey> int-e: is there a O(1) function for lists?
21:00:18 <vincenz> haskey: no
21:00:20 <int-e> head and tail
21:00:32 <vincenz> int-e: you forget id
21:00:50 <int-e> vincenz: and []
21:00:56 <int-e> vincenz:  and (:)
21:00:57 <vincenz> and [1]
21:00:59 <int-e> vincenz: more?
21:01:03 <vincenz> yeah
21:01:12 <int-e> vincenz: well, composiitons of O(1) functions, of course :)
21:01:15 <vincenz> we should be as complete as possible when helping newbs :P
21:01:29 <dylan> @type (:)
21:01:31 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]
21:01:41 <vincenz> dylan: first class data constructors ;)
21:01:42 <int-e> > [1] == 1:[]
21:01:43 <lambdabot>  True
21:01:47 <dylan> hah. cons is a function, cool.
21:01:51 <vincenz> > (:) 1 [1]
21:01:52 <lambdabot>  [1,1]
21:01:56 <vincenz> dylan: no it's not
21:01:59 <vincenz> dylan: it's a data constructor
21:02:02 <dylan> right.
21:02:04 <vincenz> just like any other infix data constructor
21:02:06 <int-e> data constructors are functions
21:02:16 <vincenz> data Funky = Int :=> String
21:02:20 <vincenz>  1 :=> "a"
21:02:21 <vincenz> or
21:02:27 <vincenz> (:=>) 1 "a"
21:02:45 <vincenz> int-e: otherwise said, they're firstclass values :)
21:02:48 <dylan> @type Just
21:02:50 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> Maybe a
21:02:58 <vincenz> data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
21:03:09 <dylan> yeah, I know.
21:03:14 <vincenz> ah k :)
21:03:15 * dylan is reading Prelude
21:03:20 <vincenz> that's a great thing
21:03:25 <glguy> @where translate
21:03:25 <lambdabot> I know nothing about translate.
21:03:25 <vincenz> for instance
21:03:29 <vincenz> > map Just [1..10]
21:03:30 <lambdabot>  [Just 1,Just 2,Just 3,Just 4,Just 5,Just 6,Just 7,Just 8,Just 9,Just 10]
21:03:37 <vincenz> @hoogle translate
21:03:38 <lambdabot> No matches found
21:03:42 <glguy> @hoogle [[a]] -> [[a]]
21:03:43 <lambdabot> List.transpose :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
21:03:46 <glguy> transpose :)
21:04:06 <dylan> I implemented transpose in ocaml by copying its haskell definition
21:04:14 <int-e> > catMaybes [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
21:04:15 <lambdabot>  [1,3]
21:04:30 <dylan> (and changing list comprehentions to a map function that disgards on exceptions)
21:04:31 <edwardk> heh i find i'm writing code in javascript by copying haskell definitions now ;)
21:04:55 <int-e> > transpose [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]]
21:04:56 <lambdabot>  [[1,4,6],[2,5],[3]]
21:04:59 <vincenz> dylan: I once wrote an xml parser in c using ocaml idioms (as back then I used ocaml a lot )
21:05:10 <vincenz> erm
21:05:12 <vincenz> xml validator
21:05:13 <vincenz> not parser
21:05:16 <vincenz> based on xsd
21:05:19 <edwardk> *nods*
21:05:28 <dylan> eew, C, eew, XML.
21:05:43 <vincenz> dylan: yeah well back then I was a software consultant....
21:05:47 <dylan> in my imaginary world, C and XML don't exist.
21:06:06 <vincenz> now I'm a grad student and I get to skim over those icky things and write my tools in haskell and ocaml :)
21:06:12 <dylan> consulting is painful. I'm glad I'm a student and IT department now.
21:07:24 * dylan = undergrad, for quite a while to come.
21:07:28 <vincenz> you're an it departement?
21:07:33 <dylan> Yep.
21:07:46 * vincenz ponders
21:07:47 <int-e> @localtime dons
21:07:49 <lambdabot> Local time for dons is Tue Jul 18 14:03:06 2006
21:08:13 <dylan> The pay isn't very good, but it's flexible time-wise.
21:08:24 <vincenz> you mean you work -in- an it departement
21:08:31 <vincenz> you aren't actually a departement
21:08:32 <dylan> No, I mean I am the IT department.
21:08:34 <vincenz> I mean you're a human
21:08:52 <vincenz> or so I presume at least
21:08:53 <dylan> I function as a department for most intents and purposes.
21:08:55 <SamB> vincenz: if the department contains one person, you can say that that person is the department
21:09:03 <vincenz> SamB: I'm just messing around :)
21:09:27 <vincenz> tho I admit it sounds funky
21:09:54 <dylan> Technically, the Operations Director is also the IT guy, but he wants to offload almost everything on me.
21:10:08 <vincenz> dylan: how old aer you
21:10:12 <dylan> 20.
21:10:26 <dylan> 21 in september.
21:11:03 * vincenz sighs as he continues to click "get mail" non stop but nothing arrives
21:12:01 <dylan> vincenz: why do you ask?
21:12:06 <vincenz> curious
21:12:13 <dylan> Ah.
21:12:17 <vincenz> I have a high curiousity
21:12:19 <vincenz> it's annoying
21:12:24 <xah> hi all
21:12:39 <xah> can the functional programers here give me some feedback about
21:12:50 <xah> a exposition i wrote on Java's Interface?
21:12:56 <dylan> I started programming for money about 3 years ago... being a freelance programmer wasn't a wise idea.
21:13:02 <vincenz> xah: why ?
21:13:07 <vincenz> xah: what does java have to do with fpl
21:13:33 <dylan> xah: how many anonymous classes do you use? if it's more than 20... ;)
21:13:37 <dons> int-e?
21:13:47 <int-e> yes?
21:14:00 <dons> you localtime-pinged?
21:14:16 <xah> the exposition is here: http://xahlee.org/java-a-day/interface.html
21:14:17 <lambdabot> Title: Xah: Java-a-day
21:14:17 <int-e> it wasn't a ping. I was wondering what timezone your irc stats used.
21:14:38 <dons> i'm improving the stats just now, grabbed the past year off clog
21:14:44 <dons> (which includes lambdabot's stuff)
21:14:44 <xah> and i wish to have your feedback. Thanks.
21:15:22 <vincenz> dons: woot, new link?
21:15:37 <vincenz> xah: tbh... I diagonally went through the article
21:15:51 <vincenz> you only use fp to illustrate what a function is, which is highly unecessary, for the rest it hardly ties in with FPL
21:15:58 <vincenz> I would ask someone in the OO community
21:16:00 <vincenz> possibly java
21:16:57 <dylan> "In a functional language, a function can be specified by its name and parameter specs." doesn't quite sit well.
21:17:11 <dons> vincenz: same link, first 50 days of the year generated so far, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/haskell.html
21:17:11 <lambdabot> Title: #haskell @ SomeIRCNet stats by MAINTAINER
21:17:32 <vincenz> dons: cool
21:17:40 <vincenz> damn I'm third
21:17:45 <ozone> xah: i don't really buy the interface complexity argument.  haskell has the same situation with type classes
21:18:07 <ozone> it's a (required) by-product of static typing
21:18:24 <xah> ozone: umm... not sure i understand...
21:18:40 <edwardk> gah oohaskell is slow
21:18:41 <dons> dylan: do you know how you got the slighly prettier output on your stats page?
21:18:43 <dons> magic flags?
21:18:51 <vincenz> xah: I also fail to see what JNI has to do with abstraction mechanisms
21:18:56 <dylan> dons: make sure the graphics are in the right place.
21:19:05 <dons> dylan: i.e. howd the Daily activity graph pop up?
21:19:09 <dons> oh, i've got the graphics
21:19:15 <ozone> xah: quote -- "the class ArrayList has these interfaces: Cloneable, Collection, List, RandomAccess, Serializable"
21:19:16 <dylan> make sure they're in the right location.
21:19:22 <ozone> some of haskell's types are no different
21:19:25 <xah> what i was trying to illustrate, is that Java's Interface isn't really a Interface at all
21:19:28 <dylan> dons: I'll lift the veil of index.html so you can see everything.
21:19:57 <dylan> dons: index lifted.
21:20:04 <xah> ozone: do haskell has Interface as a technical term in the lang?
21:20:08 <ozone> they're about as interface-y as you can get, as far as i'm concerned
21:20:12 <dons> dylan: its generating the graphics correctly. but some pieces of the table are missing, in particular 'Daily Activity' and most active links by hour.
21:20:14 <xah> or were you just using the term?
21:20:15 <dons> ok, cheers
21:20:22 <ozone> xah: type classes are somewhat of an equivalent
21:20:37 <xah> ozone: do you know Java?
21:20:41 <dylan> dons: ahh, config files.
21:20:48 <dons> ah!
21:20:57 <dylan> dons: check common.m4
21:20:58 <xah> ozone: you kinda need to know Java...
21:21:06 <dons> cheers
21:21:37 <vincenz> xah: I nkow java and haskell
21:23:22 <edwardk> wow you reaally want to pick some fights with sun on in that revew
21:23:55 <dibblego> I have never met anyone who says they "know Java" and it was actually true
21:24:18 <dibblego> it's a very bold claim
21:24:21 <vincenz> dibblego: questioning my statement?
21:24:21 <ozone> xah: i know java enough, i believe
21:24:31 <dibblego> vincenz, just making an observation
21:24:40 <edwardk> first of all the term "API" is pretty well locked into common jargon, you can view it as either an "application programming" interface or the application's "programming interface", so picking a fight with them calling it an API without offering a linguistic alternative that carries as much intent to a programmer is kind of a cheap shot
21:24:42 <vincenz> it's not really a complex language
21:24:42 <ozone> i know C++ ;)
21:24:48 <vincenz> I might not know all of the stdlib
21:24:53 <vincenz> but the language itself is rather simple
21:24:59 <vincenz> especially w.r.t c++ for instance
21:25:03 <dibblego> vincenz, the best score I have seen on my test is 4/10, and of course, I get 10/10 because I wrote it and even I do not "know Java"
21:25:10 * edwardk is a sun certified enterprise architect, but hates java ;)
21:25:21 <dibblego> edwardk, likewise
21:25:46 <vincenz> dibblego: what test is this
21:25:54 <dibblego> vincenz, I just make one up usually
21:26:02 <vincenz> I'll admit to not having touched it since before the introduction of generics
21:26:08 <vincenz> dibblego: interviewer?
21:26:14 <dibblego> I have some stuff online, but of course, that's just cheating
21:26:26 <vincenz> dibblego: why's that?
21:26:27 <dibblego> vincenz, I used to work on the implementation; thankfully no longer
21:26:33 <vincenz> cool
21:26:41 <vincenz> which leads me to a question I had
21:26:47 <vincenz> is method lookup done by name?
21:26:56 <vincenz> I rememberl ooking at the bytecode spec once and it seemed to be name-indexed
21:26:58 <vincenz> aka string
21:27:01 <xah> so on the whole, the essay is what? not convincing? rambling? incorrect? ...?
21:27:07 <dibblego> there is a constant_pool which contains method names
21:27:13 <edwardk> as for the interface being like properties, sure. its the java vocabulary large and redundant? sure. but if i want to clone an object i don't care about all the superfluous stuff that can be bolted on orthogonally to that feature i just want the Clonable interface. it doesn't make sense TO glue those features together. interfaces provide a consistent view of a featureset that can be orthogonal to other features.
21:27:13 <vincenz> xah: non consequitur
21:27:19 <dibblego> it is in the vmspec section 4 iirc
21:27:32 <vincenz> dibblego: why not go for exact offset?
21:27:37 <edwardk> the essay comes off like someone trying to pick a fight who doesn't like the language
21:28:03 <xah> edwardk: ok...  how about this idea:
21:28:10 <dibblego> vincenz, I don't know the exact details of the bytecode spec in my head, but there are lookups with offsets to constants (method names, etc.)
21:28:15 <xah> one main thing i wanted to say in that essay is that
21:28:19 <vincenz> dibblego: ah good :)
21:28:24 <xah> in functional programing (or any programing),
21:28:27 <vincenz> dibblego: anyways maybe we have a different definition of know :)
21:28:37 <dibblego> vincenz, probably :)
21:28:43 <vincenz> dibblego: and I'll grant that my java-fu is not as strong as my haskell or c++-fu
21:28:47 <dylan> IIRC, name-based lookup of methods doesn't exist on some embeded java platforms... but I have never used java nor read any specs.
21:29:06 <xah> the gist of the concept of “interface” is that it provides a spec where the implementation is hidden from the programer or not necessary to know to use the function
21:29:09 <edwardk> xah: in haskell you wind up using 'interfaces' all the time you just call them type classes. and lo and behold they are just as small and modular as java's interfaces.
21:29:12 <xah> and,
21:29:12 <dibblego> vincenz, there are lots of myths surrounding the language - it's easy to pick on those to score a few non-points :)
21:29:23 <vincenz> dibblego: what sorto f myhts?
21:29:26 <edwardk> xah: they serve that role in java as well
21:29:37 <dibblego> vincenz, there are a bazillion
21:29:38 <xah> e.g. in FP, all one needed to know to use a function is it's parametr input.
21:29:40 <vincenz> dibblego: my observations were mostly based on personal practice
21:29:53 <xah> And, my claim about Java's interface is that
21:29:54 <edwardk> xah: thats not entirely true
21:30:02 <vincenz> xah: that's a rather weak and arbitrary claim
21:30:11 <xah> it is not interface at all.
21:30:14 <dibblego> vincenz, the interpretations of how java.lang.String works can be simplified somewhat
21:30:36 <vincenz> dibblego: oh... I typically see knowing a language as knowing the semantics and syntax, as well as the cases where they don't combine orthogonally...
21:30:42 <vincenz> dibblego: not the entire lib
21:30:45 <dibblego> I was just talking about the "don't use the String concatenation operator without a performance hit" myth this morning
21:30:55 <dibblego> vincenz, no, I mean the language itself
21:31:00 <edwardk> xah: look at haskell. if you want to compare things you need an instance of the Eq class for that type. the Eq  class serves just the same role as the java interface, at the same level of abstraction
21:31:05 <dibblego> java.lang.String is bound to the language (unfortunately)
21:31:06 <vincenz> dibblego: I would think that string would be an implementational cchcoice...
21:31:13 <vincenz> as in under the hood, no
21:31:14 <vincenz> ?
21:31:21 <dibblego> vincenz, it's not that simple
21:31:23 <edwardk> although arguably LESS pure because i can give it a default implementation =)
21:31:31 <vincenz> dibblego: how so?
21:31:43 <dibblego> vincenz, there are times when the language guarantees a performance *gain* by using the concatenation operator
21:31:55 <xah> umm... i don't think i agree to see to the sentiment that people don't see or understand what i'm saying
21:32:00 <vincenz> dibblego: hmm... I find it odd that such things are put in the language and not in the lib
21:32:01 <dibblego> vincenz, there is also myth surrounding String literal/constant values and how the garbage collector works with them
21:32:16 <xah> agree to see -> agree or see
21:32:26 <vincenz> dibblego: does java use sharing like ruby?
21:32:32 <dibblego> vincenz, Java has operator overloading bound to the language and java.lang.String is an operand in some cases
21:32:37 <dibblego> I barely know Ruby
21:32:48 <vincenz> basicaclly they share strings and do cow
21:32:53 <dibblego> I read something for about 15 minutes - nothing more
21:32:56 <vincenz> even substrings
21:33:21 <dibblego> there is no write (all methods are transparent)
21:33:32 <vincenz> dibblego: right... but I would think that the operator overloadd version for string parameters would be a native implementation
21:33:40 <edwardk> i just don't see the uselessness of the java concept of an interface. I just see that you want the term to mean something else.
21:33:46 <dibblego> and strings are shared across a class loader (there is a myth that they are shared across the universe or the JVM) in certain cases
21:33:49 <vincenz> dibblego: oh..right
21:33:52 <vincenz> forgot they're immutable
21:34:03 <edwardk> Its not going to, they have more bodies than you do to throw at the vocabulary war, bend and move on ;)
21:34:19 <xah> edwardk: you understand the concept of interface in a functional lang?
21:34:27 <vincenz> xah: I think you don't
21:34:32 <vincenz> I wouldn't call a function an interface
21:34:42 <edwardk> nor would i
21:34:46 <vincenz> a typeclass could be considered one, possibly a module but then with one implementation
21:34:49 <vincenz> but definitely not a functio
21:34:49 <ozone> me three
21:35:07 <dibblego> are interfaces being equated to functions somehow?
21:35:17 <vincenz> dibblego: yeah, that's how the article starts off
21:35:19 <edwardk> in xah's reasoning, yes.
21:35:33 <edwardk> kind of muddling signature and interface
21:35:47 <xah> ok, i think i know what you guys mean now
21:35:48 <vincenz> edwardk: but he refers to the function, not the function type, which would then be the signature
21:35:55 * vincenz scratches his head
21:35:58 <ozone> xah: if you want to be harsh, i'd say your article is a load of crap
21:35:58 <edwardk> *nods*
21:35:59 <xah> and sorry but i don't really know haskell
21:36:05 <ozone> (if you want to be harsh :)
21:36:10 <dibblego> where is the article?
21:36:14 <xah> ozone: yes. I need honest opinion. Thanks.
21:36:17 <vincenz> xah: I also ail to see why you're asking in this channel
21:36:26 <dons> why are we talking about java?
21:36:29 <vincenz> xah: your article obviously targets java
21:36:30 <dons> isn't this #haskell
21:36:37 <edwardk> yeah i do have to admit that the article seems pretty far off topic
21:36:38 <ozone> dons: yeah, let's talk about C++
21:36:45 <dibblego> xah, where is the article?
21:37:12 <xah> http://xahlee.org/java-a-day/interface.html
21:37:12 <lambdabot> Title: Xah: Java-a-day
21:37:15 * vincenz smacks ozone over the head with a lazy inifinte list
21:37:46 <xah> as to you people's opinion about what i said about interface...
21:37:46 <dibblego> you're that usenet guy right?
21:37:51 <vincenz> xah: could you perhaps motivate your reason for coming here to ask about opinions on this article?
21:37:54 <vincenz> dibblego: yes he is
21:37:55 <xah> i htink there are two possibilities:
21:38:04 <edwardk> so, any suggestions on how to construct a heterogeneous record type at runtime that doesn't suffer from HList/OOHaskell's overhead?
21:38:11 <xah> (1) you people are too shallow and don't understand.
21:38:22 --- mode: ChanServ set +o vincenz
21:38:47 * vincenz peers at xah 
21:39:11 <xah> (2) there are something i'm not understanding in Haskell, which could mean something i said about interface in that article are somewhat wrong
21:39:29 <vincenz> (3) your aticle is completely off topic, has reasoning which is flawed, and should prolly be discussed in ##java
21:39:38 <edwardk> xah: go off and read about type classes
21:39:56 <xah> vincenz: you can fuck off. Because, from the very beginning you are trolling and fucking with me.
21:40:02 <ozone> xah: edwardk's right, check out type classes
21:40:09 <edwardk> xah: though you are off topic
21:40:15 <ozone> edwardk: existentials?
21:40:25 <edwardk> ozone: for the records?
21:40:29 <ozone> how on earth is he off-topic?  he's asking haskell-related stuff
21:40:40 <xah> if you do not wish to engage on my question about java, just don't respond. And if i continue, just ask it explicitly and seriously.
21:40:45 <ozone> edwardk: oh, sorry, read that at heterogenous lists
21:40:54 <edwardk> ozone: with java interfaces? =)
21:41:05 <edwardk> ozone: how would i go about doing that?
21:41:09 <xah> i wanted to ask this is stated explicitly in my first question: i want functional programer's opinion of it.
21:41:09 <ozone> well, existentials are pretty damn similar to java interfaces
21:41:17 <ozone> since you're wrapping up the type class inside a type
21:41:18 <edwardk> ozone: currently i'm doing all sorts of OOHaskell/HList voodoo
21:41:38 <edwardk> but i don't think it will scale to the size i need it to and its slow _now_.
21:41:42 <ozone> you get less static type checking, but oh well, c'est la vie
21:41:55 <xah> i cannot possibly give a fuck what Java programers or imperative lang programers have a fuck to say about it, even if they have few Ph D tags tatoos on their head. Because they don't know shit.
21:42:02 <vincenz> xah: mind your language
21:42:14 <ozone> edwardk: can't you write a custom data type to support only the different types you want, and unpack that as necessary?
21:42:22 <xah> vincenz: sorry. My mood is spoiled. I'll take a break.
21:42:28 * vincenz nods
21:42:37 <edwardk> ozone: this is part of an interpreter/compiler so its a little tricky
21:42:50 <ozone> edwardk: and i guess do some profiling to find out where the problem really is
21:42:52 <dibblego> wow, I turn around and have a chat and it has all change
21:42:52 <dibblego> d
21:42:54 <ozone> if you haven't already, that is
21:43:13 <vincenz> dibblego: how's it going with the tutorial?
21:43:17 <vincenz> dibblego: or that wasn't you?
21:43:27 <edwardk> ozone: well, the big problem is i think all the nested dictionaries needed to make HList work
21:43:27 <dibblego> yeah it's me - up to page 60 or so
21:43:37 <dibblego> getting a bit lost in the formalism, but that's ok
21:43:47 <vincenz> dibblego: I think as far as haskell tutorials go, yaht is one of the best
21:43:57 <edwardk> ozone: so when i start using them to build up the parallel class structure i need to get the ecma4 type system to work, i get an explosion of types and lots of type class hackery
21:44:04 <vincenz> at least it helped me get a grasp on haskell :)
21:44:14 --- mode: vincenz set -o vincenz
21:44:17 <dibblego> xah, I think your article is wrong
21:44:25 <ozone> edwardk: right, that's why i don't like hlist as well
21:44:28 <edwardk> ozone: coz i have two hierarchies, and two forms of method dispatch to deal with
21:44:44 <edwardk> so i not only have to pay for HList but again for it in case i have to resort to the hashes
21:45:09 <edwardk> i started banging out a tree based replacement for the HList stuff to see if i could get performance out of it
21:45:22 <ozone> edwardk: i'd say just make your own data type to be used solely as a container for other data types, but i don't really know the problem area you're addressing, and i have to bail now anyway :)  good luck
21:45:24 <edwardk> but i don't like the resulting type set
21:45:38 <vincenz> edwardk: is there a reason you use existentials over a closed universe with sumtypes?/
21:45:50 <vincenz> s/use/choose
21:46:04 <edwardk> vincenz: gezundheit ;)
21:46:10 <edwardk> oh
21:46:13 <vincenz> :)
21:46:23 <edwardk> for the language compiler?
21:46:27 <vincenz> hmm yeah
21:46:40 <vincenz> I'm working on a compiler as well, and I basically create a closed universe for the type of values it can handle
21:46:48 <jgrimes> have any of you read "essentials of programming languages" ?
21:46:51 <edwardk> well, i have to support javascript, so i have to support classes extended by the language.
21:46:51 <dibblego> vincenz, here is one of my trivia questions: String s1 = "a"; String s2 = "a"; System.out.println("a == a" + a == a); // prints?
21:46:59 <edwardk> i was hoping to use the type system in haskell to take care of most of that work
21:47:13 <vincenz> dibblego: a being?
21:47:15 <edwardk> and i don't want to pay the lookup/dispatch overhead over and over if i can avoid it
21:47:35 <dibblego> vincenz, what do you mean?
21:47:42 <vincenz> dibblego: you mean "s1 == s2" + s1 == s2
21:47:43 <vincenz> ?
21:47:48 <dibblego> oops
21:47:54 <edwardk> and i don't want to lose typing just to reconstruct it and check it at runtime for the static side of the language.
21:47:57 <dibblego> vincenz, here is one of my trivia questions: String s1 = "a"; String s2 = "a"; System.out.println("a == a" + s1 == s2); // prints?
21:48:00 <dibblego> sorry
21:48:06 <dons> ok, there we go guys, full stats for 2006/#haskell, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/haskell.html
21:48:07 <lambdabot> Title: #haskell @ freenode.org stats by dons
21:48:11 <dons> ?were+ stats http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/haskell.html
21:48:12 <lambdabot> Done.
21:48:14 <edwardk> i have two parallel type systems and two forms of method dispatch coz they try to please everyone.
21:48:15 <vincenz> dibblego: I'm presuming False...most imperative languages tend to do by pointer
21:48:36 <jgrimes> wow, go lambdabot :)
21:48:45 <edwardk> one is where i have a class and it extends another class, etc. those i can optimize away. the others go through the prototype hierarchy. those i can't
21:48:45 <vincenz> unless you use a method that's explicitly made for deep-comparison
21:48:55 <dons> looking at the graphs, its almost like lambdabot never sleeps
21:49:09 <vincenz> edwardk: afaik... if you use existentials you have lookup
21:49:12 <vincenz> edwardk: and dispatch
21:49:23 <vincenz> edwardk: so at that point you might as well use sumtypes and remove your headache ?
21:49:38 <vincenz> dibblego: I outrank you :)
21:49:41 <vincenz> erm
21:49:43 <vincenz> dons: I outrank you
21:49:46 <edwardk> meaning foralls?
21:49:48 <dibblego> vincenz, there are a few people who think they are clever enough to know about the String literal pool - where since the two expressions are constants, the same instance is used, so s1 == s2 is true and answer "a == a true", but they forget about operator precedence - the correct answer is simply "false"
21:49:58 <jgrimes> it's pretty funny that monad is more used than should or could
21:50:00 <vincenz> edwardk: like data X = A A | B B
21:50:11 <dibblego> most people don't know what a constant is though
21:50:26 <vincenz> dibblego: ah rightio
21:50:41 <vincenz> dibblego: yeah I considered that option but thought the quiz was about the constant pooling
21:50:45 <vincenz> :)
21:51:19 <vincenz> dibblego: I find it rather nasty, however, that booleans auto-conver to string
21:51:21 <dibblego> there is a common myth that a final declaration is always constant
21:51:24 <dons> jgrimes: yeah, cool heh?
21:51:29 <jgrimes> dons, I think so :)
21:51:43 <edwardk> vincenz i don't want to close the set, primarily because i am dealing with different versions of the language and will be extending it with builtin types, and would like builtin types to be readily constructible without fixed point hackery, since i'm already using THAT for the interpreter/recompiling bits =)
21:51:55 <vincenz> edwardk: ah ok :)
21:51:56 <dibblego> vincenz, (String + boolean) evaluates to String
21:52:13 <vincenz> edwardk: what I did is basically have Data Value a = VBool Bool | VInt Int | VValue a
21:52:28 <vincenz> dibblego: yeah...haskell won't allow such things as it messes up with typeinference
21:52:40 <dons> dylan: so looks like #haskell is about 5x as busy as #ocaml?
21:52:46 <dibblego> vincenz, http://jqa.tmorris.net/GetQAndA.action?categories=Trivia I wrote that a while back
21:52:47 <lambdabot> Title: Java Questions and Answers - Trivia
21:52:49 <dons> roughly figuring number of nicks
21:53:00 <edwardk> yeah I have a pretty rich type hierarchy i'm stuck with, and I want it to be readily extensible on the haskell side
21:53:04 <vincenz> dibblego: thx :)
21:53:09 <vincenz> dibblego: so why switch to haskell?
21:53:30 <dibblego> vincenz, Java is broken; I've been reading about pure functional programming for years but never done anything with it
21:53:38 * vincenz nod
21:53:47 <vincenz> well welcome
21:53:56 <dibblego> my employer is pure Java
21:54:04 <dibblego> but I convinced my boss that Java is busted
21:54:11 <dibblego> so now I'm tasked with finding the solution
21:54:13 <vincenz> I did java stuff when I was a consultant
21:54:18 <edwardk> Strings, Objects, Numbers, Regexps, Functions, Arrays (that are really hashes, etc), THEN I have the new ecma4 types that can all take constrained parameters and includes a structural record type subtype system.
21:54:21 <vincenz> but that's been hmm....3 years now
21:54:30 <vincenz> edwardk: your compiler is for a dynlanguage?
21:54:46 <edwardk> vincenz: ecma4 == the new javascript. so its part dynamic, part static
21:54:48 <vincenz> edwardk: I guess my compiler is less about usability and more about analysis, I use it to study some transformations
21:54:56 <vincenz> edwardk: so I don't need a rich value set
21:54:57 <dibblego> I'm wondering if consulting with Haskell is a worthwhile possibility
21:55:08 <vincenz> dibblego: there's been talk about it by shapr
21:55:09 * edwardk is all about usability
21:55:14 <dibblego> shapr?
21:55:32 <vincenz> edwardk: yeah I'm researching some transformations so I map code samples to my mini language which resembles miniML a lot and then do the transformations there
21:55:35 <edwardk> and if i just cast away all the stuff by throwing it into Dynamic I lose all benefit of moving to haskell in the first place.
21:55:35 <vincenz> dibblego: someone in this channel
21:55:40 <vincenz> @seen shapr
21:55:40 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell-blah, #haskell, #unicycling, #ScannedInAvian and #haskell.se. I last heard shapr speak 4 hours, 44 minutes and 14 seconds ago.
21:55:42 <dibblego> oh right
21:56:00 <edwardk> i'd like to have it that if I can compile the code, the code has to run, coz its typesafe ;)
21:56:25 <edwardk> it can still do whatever stupid imperative thing they tell me to do, but at least i won't fark up the translation
21:56:51 <edwardk> i just can't think of a good safe alternative to HList for my vtable representation.
21:57:02 <vincenz> edwardk: is it an open system?
21:57:05 <edwardk> very
21:57:09 <vincenz> ah damn
21:57:14 <vincenz> otherwise you could calculate methodlookup
21:57:19 <vincenz> edwardk: why not go for hashtable?
21:57:25 <vincenz> or Map String x
21:57:27 <edwardk> i use a hash table for the dynamic side
21:57:45 <vincenz> how do you represent a vtable as an hlist
21:58:01 <edwardk> and in my case its a little worse than that, coz i have multiple namespaces (where namespaces don't mean what you think) that can be active and i lookup methods on an object by namespace as well as name)
21:58:09 <edwardk> and have to deal with getters and setters
21:58:21 <vincenz> dons: I apparently own the words "could" "would" and "should" in #haskell :D
21:58:31 <edwardk> well, i've been hacking on HList, so i have my own label types, letting me say things like
21:58:32 <dons> hehe
21:58:36 <edwardk> public foo .=. bar
21:59:08 <edwardk> which makes a label in the namespace public as well as the the stock package level, etc.
21:59:11 <vincenz> dons: that page is scary
21:59:45 <zarvok> vincenz: out of curiosity, did you guys decide to break up your icfp team or stay together?
21:59:46 <dons> we're so so much more talkative than #ocaml, maybe we're spending too much time in here?
21:59:58 <vincenz> zarvok: stay together, but not many people showed up
22:00:04 <vincenz> dons: yeah
22:00:08 <edwardk> vincenz: then i store two parts to each object. one hash table that maps to 'dynamic' javascript objects that provide a generic getter/setter interface and calling pattern. and one that is the vtable record type, the vtable is necessarily static
22:00:10 <vincenz> dons: though I have to admit it's a useful source of ideas
22:00:22 <vincenz> dons: for instance thanks to #haskell I'm now planning a collaboration with another uni
22:00:22 <zarvok> vincenz: too bad, hope you guys do well though
22:00:22 <dons> oh dear,
22:00:23 <dons> lambdabot spoke a total of 289385 words!
22:00:24 <dons> lambdabot's faithful follower, dons, didn't speak so much: 246344 words.
22:00:31 <dons> looks like lambdabot owns me now
22:00:31 <vincenz> dons: and I got into ANF
22:00:32 <zarvok> vincenz: more info comes out wednesday, be on the lookout :)
22:00:40 <edwardk> so you can't override something made with class foo { public function bar () { } }; by changing foo.prototype

22:00:46 <lambdabot> gzl says: [on why monads are scary] maybe it's because people look up monad on wikipedia, find the category theory page, and crap themselves

22:00:51 <dons> vincenz: cool!
22:00:56 <SamB_XP> lambdabot isn't very original
22:00:57 <vincenz> zarvok: looking out for it :)
22:00:58 <edwardk> lets me share the vtable across multiple objects.
22:01:08 <vincenz> zarvok: just hope that my jetlag will be gone by then :P
22:01:10 <dons> yeah, it keeps us all together. it wouldn't be so good if the quality wasn't so high
22:01:10 <SamB_XP> @quote
22:01:10 <lambdabot> spj says: it looks like hopscotch! (referring to a funny notation for lists)
22:01:14 <edwardk> the hash table also includes a pointer to the prototype for the hash table, so its got chained lookup semantics there

22:04:33 <edwardk> was wondering if lambdabot had a smiley factor or something =P
22:04:45 <vincenz> edwardk: trying to win it :) ?
22:04:47 <dons> maybe :[] is a smiley?
22:04:59 <vincenz> dons: (:) sure will be
22:05:10 <edwardk> i.e. edwardk 20% =P 60% =) 8% =/ 12% serious
22:05:18 <dons> the "I'm swallowing TaPL smiley" :[]
22:05:25 <vincenz> lol
22:06:05 <zarvok> :)
22:06:41 <edwardk> sort and uniq and count times saying the same thing and we might have a hit =)
22:06:45 <vincenz> zarvok: so did you mean the fact a lot of people dropped out or the fact our team's not split when you said pity?
22:06:50 * SamB_XP wonders why SamB_XP is a yeller
22:07:04 <edwardk> so no ideas on an alternative to HList in my context?
22:07:09 <zarvok> vincenz: that a lot of people dropped
22:07:21 <vincenz> zarvok: there might be another reason tho... I don't think many people knew of the meeting we had planned... and it was just mentioned on the wiki site
22:07:27 <vincenz> zarvok: so possibly the others will show up later
22:07:28 <edwardk> i suppose i could use another hash for the vtable and rely on the fact that its immutable
22:07:35 <SamB_XP> hmm, this is not accurate
22:07:39 <edwardk> so i can cache the lookup
22:07:46 <SamB_XP> lambdabot is a very aggressive person. He/She attacked others 33 times.
22:07:46 <SamB_XP> For example, like this:
22:07:46 <SamB_XP>      * lambdabot smacks lambdabot about with a large trout
22:07:53 <zarvok> imho it's silly to be super-concerned with first place, only one team gets it, and if you're that worried about it you'll have less fun
22:07:58 <SamB_XP> lambdabot is not an "other" wrt lambdabot!
22:08:02 <vincenz> zarvok: true 'nuff
22:08:18 <vincenz> zarvok: but we have a large variety of skills in our team
22:08:23 <vincenz> zarvok: so maybe they could be clustered
22:08:28 <SamB_XP> how does it figure out smileys?
22:08:38 <vincenz> SamB_XP: it's not lambdabot
22:08:43 <vincenz> SamB_XP: it's an external script running on the log by lambdabot
22:08:45 <zarvok> vincenz: well, I think you'll find it to your advantage to work as a group
22:08:55 <SamB_XP> I didn't say it was lambdabot, did I?
22:08:55 <vincenz> zarvok: good to know :)
22:08:59 <zarvok> vincenz: I can't say too much though
22:09:09 <vincenz> zarvok: that's why we have a whole set of organizational decisions on our wiki :P
22:09:17 <zarvok> heh
22:09:23 <vincenz> zarvok: keep the communication overhead down when online
22:09:42 <vincenz> (I guess I got a bit excited early one and wanted to do something related to icfpc)

22:10:53 <SamB_XP> wow, no op activity?
22:10:54 <vincenz> dons: SamB_XP brings up a good point, if this script was integrated with lambdabot, he could do some contextual chcecking, such as which are actually nicks
22:11:00 <zarvok> vincenz: we're really excited about the competition, I think you'll find it's a lot of fun
22:11:07 <vincenz> zarvok: great \o/
22:11:13 <SamB_XP> well, I assume someone must have taken those as nicks at some point
22:11:22 <zarvok> but for now, I have to get back to testing it
22:11:28 <dons> vincenz: I suppose someone actually must have joined as 'a' or 'I'
22:11:32 <vincenz> zarvok: we've already been guestimating what it could be during our kickoff meeting (which was right after I had a 13 hour trip and had been up for > 20 hours)
22:11:40 <vincenz> dons: it's prolly a regexp based on a:
22:11:42 <dons> which is confusing the script. maybe I can fix that..
22:11:52 <zarvok> vincenz: heh, what did you come up with?
22:12:02 <vincenz> zarvok: it's rather generic
22:12:12 <vincenz> we're expecting some sort of thing based on semantics definition
22:12:29 <vincenz> so haskell's great for that if we use combinators :)
22:12:34 <SamB_XP> so, is it really true that nobody had ops?
22:12:40 <vincenz> SamB_XP: sure we do
22:12:42 <dons> i think that's been a bug as well
22:12:46 --- mode: ChanServ set +o vincenz
22:12:48 <vincenz> SamB_XP: I have ops now

22:12:58 <zarvok> heh, I guess you're pulling this from "computational archaeolinguistics"
22:13:05 <zarvok> well, you'll see soon enough
22:13:06 <vincenz> zarvok: well that's our only basis
22:13:08 <SamB_XP> dons: is that in the logs correctly?
22:13:08 <vincenz> :)
22:13:19 <vincenz> zarvok: should prolly stop talking about this, or you'll feel so excited you'll be tempted to share
22:13:34 <zarvok> heh, trust me, my cocreators would kill me
22:13:46 <vincenz> :D
22:13:55 <vincenz> part of the fun is the christmas-present effect when the time strikes
22:14:00 <vincenz> btw, when is the exact hour?
22:14:06 <zarvok> oh yes, don't worry, I won't give anything away
22:14:08 <dons> SamB_XP: yes. I and 'a' have been occasionally used as nicks. maybe 3x in 2 years
22:14:09 <zarvok> noon EDT on friday
22:14:11 <vincenz> hmm
22:14:12 <dons> which confuses things
22:14:14 <dons> fixing ...
22:14:14 <vincenz> when is EDT?
22:14:20 * vincenz is bad with us timezones
22:14:31 <vincenz> zarvok: possibly put up a list of the time in other timezones?
22:14:43 <SamB_XP> well, in E[SD]T, its about 1:14 AM
22:14:48 <dons> bad vincenz ;)
22:14:52 * vincenz whistles
22:14:52 <zarvok> I'll mention it to the guy who set up the website
22:14:52 <SamB_XP> whicher one of those is current
22:15:02 <vincenz> ah
22:15:09 <vincenz> so 6hours difference with main europe (GMT+1)
22:15:32 <SamB_XP> DST makes things tricky, though
22:15:41 <zarvok> well, that's why I said EDT
22:15:43 <zarvok> instead of EST
22:15:44 <vincenz> SamB_XP: true but I doubt it'll change over the course of the weekend
22:16:06 <vincenz> dons: it doesn't make sense they're the most often addressed tho!
22:16:09 <SamB_XP> not unless it is the weekend when it changes, and that is always the night before sunday
22:16:13 <Adamant> @elite rock your box
22:16:14 <lambdabot> r0xx y0Ur b0x
22:16:24 <SamB_XP> dons: you've another of those now ;-)
22:16:25 <vincenz> dons: I mean this was once in how long?
22:16:27 <dons> vincenz: once they're seen, the script must just look for them anywhere.
22:16:33 <dons> i.e. like haskell is cool
22:16:34 <vincenz> ah rightio
22:16:56 <dons> vincenz: 'a' I' and 'haskell' have all been used 1 itme in 2 years
22:17:07 <SamB_XP> dons: I just used "haskell" again ;-)
22:17:08 <vincenz> dons: yeah reminds me with the same objection I had once of this idea of having lambdabot track nickname changes...but then if some person uses 'a' and then some other time osme other person uses it...
22:17:23 <SamB_XP> @seen haskell
22:17:23 <lambdabot> haskell has changed nick to samb_xp.
22:17:23 <lambdabot> samb_xp is in #haskell-blah and #haskell. I last heard samb_xp speak just now.
22:17:24 <vincenz> dons: I don't think a single person uses haskell that often
22:17:56 <vincenz> dons: you're popular too :)
22:18:38 <SamB_XP> oh, and dons, lambdabot probably only talks so much because people say things like:
22:18:58 <SamB_XP> > unwords $ map show [1..]
22:18:59 <lambdabot>  "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ...
22:19:07 <vincenz> SamB_XP: or things like
22:19:09 <SamB_XP> and:

22:20:10 <lambdabot> my proof show math is broken right now
22:20:15 <SamB_XP> hahaha
22:20:20 <SamB_XP> math is broken, right!
22:20:31 <SamB_XP> I would like to see that ;-)
22:20:43 <vincenz> math can't broken
22:20:43 <Korollary> Its Goedel's broken math theorem.
22:20:49 <vincenz> it just doesn't have enough axioms
22:20:54 <SamB_XP> @keal

22:21:00 <lambdabot> nsa prevent me from returning to math on efnet
22:21:04 <SamB_XP> @keal
22:21:04 <sjanssen> actually, math has been fixed since keal's statement
22:21:04 <lambdabot> one prollem. T broke confines of the visual basic langage and would not compile
22:21:12 <SamB_XP> @keal
22:21:12 <lambdabot> it is very easy to go off topic
22:21:16 <SamB_XP> @keal
22:21:16 <lambdabot> can GMP support KealDigit? I invent KealDigit
22:21:16 <vincenz> SamB_XP: really?
22:21:19 <vincenz> sjanssen: how so?
22:21:32 <vincenz> so this keal guy, was he smart or just a random spammer?
22:21:41 <SamB_XP> @quote ghc
22:21:41 <lambdabot>  At least one of the forall'd type variables mentioned by the constraint must be reachable from the type after the '=>'
22:21:42 <Korollary> He was interesting.
22:21:51 <SamB_XP> vincenz: he was all overy the place
22:21:59 <vincenz> SamB_XP: right but in a way that was meaningful ?
22:22:02 <SamB_XP> the perhaps smartest idiot you ever saw
22:22:13 <SamB_XP> or the most idiotic genius
22:22:17 <SamB_XP> or something in between
22:22:21 <vincenz> or more like statements that sounded smart but if you thought htem through were meaningless
22:22:37 <Korollary> See, he knows what GMP does. But he's way off about it with his KealDigit invention.
22:22:39 <vincenz> that seems to be a trend
22:23:21 * edwardk waits for @shemale_magic
22:23:22 <SamB_XP> Lemmih and jethr0 keep wierd hours
22:23:37 <vincenz> how so?
22:23:38 <edwardk> wow that sounded strange
22:23:38 <Korollary> edwardk: That was good, too.
22:23:39 <SamB_XP> well, not jethro so much I guess
22:23:40 <edwardk> nevermind =)
22:23:49 <SamB_XP> Lemmih seems spread around the clock
22:23:50 <Korollary> @girl19
22:23:51 <lambdabot> LOL
22:23:53 <vincenz> SamB_XP: so do I
22:23:55 <Korollary> @girl19
22:23:55 <lambdabot> am I supposed to be frantic with terror and anxiety?
22:23:59 <SamB_XP> indeed
22:24:01 <Korollary> @girl19
22:24:02 <lambdabot> am I supposed to be frantic with terror and anxiety?
22:24:07 <SamB_XP> lambdabot: is not so much!
22:24:07 <Korollary> bleh

22:24:32 <lambdabot> ?
22:24:40 <vincenz> pseudonym is the most disciplined person
22:24:46 <vincenz> he strictly comes in during 2 timeslots
22:25:02 <Korollary> He connects from work afaik
22:25:02 <SamB_XP> at least I am in only three of them ;-)
22:25:28 <vincenz> SamB_XP: well I'm rather proud of my uniform distribution :)
22:25:28 <Korollary> at least, his hours coincide with work hours in .au time
22:25:32 <vincenz> just not hte volume
22:25:34 <SamB_XP> and probably the reason it is so evenly spread is because I talk more in the morning and at night than in the afternoon
22:26:23 <dons> vincenz, lambdabot, Lemmih and jethr0 seem to be the most distrupted in their sleep, yeah?
22:26:33 <dons> vincenz: or is that because you travel?
22:26:46 <SamB_XP> lambdabot sleeps now?
22:26:49 <vincenz> dons: no that's cause I don't keep regular hours
22:26:54 <dons> (i.e. most of my 'green' entries where when i was in europe, i think)
22:27:16 <edwardk> @localtime edwardk
22:27:17 <lambdabot> Local time for edwardk is Tue Jul 18 01:26:56 2006
22:27:21 <SamB_XP> what time is it now? wait, it must be red time now
22:27:29 <edwardk> m. not up as late as usual tonight =)
22:27:43 <dons> maybe we should just measure time with colours
22:27:47 <dons> half past red
22:27:52 <SamB_XP> hahaha
22:27:56 <vincenz> :D
22:28:01 <vincenz> dons: trying to figure out what the timezone is
22:28:05 <vincenz> dons: aka how to translate to my time
22:28:06 <SamB_XP> it is also past my bed time
22:28:08 <dons> is it gmt?
22:28:17 <dons> it's the time on clog, i suspect
22:28:17 <Korollary> worldtime.com
22:28:22 <Korollary> or something
22:28:27 <dons> http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/06.07.17
22:28:50 <dons> so whatever time tunes.org thinks it is
22:29:02 <SamB_XP> I'd like to see a curve of the distribution of traffic
22:29:31 <dons> what kind of distribution?
22:29:35 <dons> maybe i can hack it up
22:30:09 <SamB_XP> well, basically I'd like to see the "Number of lines" column graphed against the rank ;-)
22:30:22 <dons> ah
22:30:41 <SamB_XP> I guess it already sort of is
22:30:42 <dons> to see how individuals vary over time.
22:30:54 <SamB_XP> no, not that
22:31:19 <SamB_XP> you see how it has those bars there and they sort of form a graph?
22:38:00 --- mode: irc.freenode.net set +o shapr
22:42:48 <edwardk> whee
22:43:35 <edwardk> ok. i think i've resolved my type issue, i just need to spend time with template haskell and actually compile javascript classes down to haskell
22:43:39 <vincenz> doh
22:43:52 <Korollary> somebody should write an irc server in haschelle
22:44:18 <vincenz> Korollary: hashi(r)sh?
22:44:24 <edwardk> that way the class stuff gets fixed, and you can still to frilly 'function() {} foo type stuff'. kinda like ghc vs. ghci
22:44:43 <ulfdoz> Does ghc's RTS real threading with kernel threads?
22:44:44 <edwardk> the function(){} lightweight stuff can sit on top of a heavier optimized implementation
22:45:17 <edwardk> ulfdoz: i think 6.5 supports that if you compile it with -threaded, but not 6.4
22:45:29 <edwardk> ulfdoz: its mentioned on the wiki
22:45:44 <ulfdoz> Interesting, than it would be really useable for server implementation.
22:46:19 <edwardk> the rts thing or my thing? =)
22:46:50 <boegel> vincenz: you're up early
22:47:01 <vincenz> boegel: you assume I sleep
22:47:11 <vincenz> boegel: I'm suffering insomnia due to jetlag and other reasons
22:47:12 <boegel> vincenz: :)
22:47:16 <vincenz> boegel: seriously
22:47:22 <boegel> vincenz: oh, damn :s
22:47:36 <vincenz> saturday->sunday: 30 hours, 5 hour sleep, monay: 19 hours, this night: 3 hours of sleep
22:47:39 <boegel> well, I guess #haskell is a good place to stay awake then
22:47:46 <boegel> woops :s
22:47:53 <vincenz> yeah
22:47:59 <vincenz> I feel like shit but I can't fall asleep
22:49:37 <zarvok> vincenz: what's your local time?
22:49:52 <vincenz> 7L49am
22:49:55 <vincenz> I went to bed at 11pm
22:50:01 <vincenz> after a 20 hour day
22:50:04 <vincenz> and I was up at 2 am
22:50:13 <zarvok> bummer
22:50:18 <Korollary> something could be wrong with your bed
22:50:22 <zarvok> heh
22:50:29 <vincenz> Korollary: your humor is enlightening
22:50:34 <Korollary> I told you not to hire two hookers!
22:50:44 * vincenz /ignore's Korollary 
22:51:00 <dons> hehe
22:51:33 <vincenz> boegel: think andy will be online today?
22:51:34 <boegel> vincenz: you were ping'ing we yesterday, why?
22:51:39 <vincenz> was hoping to talk to him about hte collaboration
22:51:39 <boegel> vincenz: probably
22:51:49 <boegel> although it's hard to say, he might spend time with his kid
22:51:53 * vincenz nods
22:51:59 <vincenz> well I can't really perform any intellectually intensive work
22:52:05 <vincenz> so I might as well do other work-related things
22:53:04 <Korollary> So your work is intellectually quite satisfying eh
22:53:16 <vincenz> zarvok: tho at this rate... I'm not sure whether I'll be able to participate :/
22:53:32 <vincenz> Korollary: phds tend to be
22:53:47 <Korollary> wait
22:53:53 * Korollary is confused
22:54:07 <Korollary> ok, I get it now.
22:54:13 * vincenz intonates Korollary "I guess that happens often"
22:54:23 <Korollary> It barely happens.
22:54:45 <boegel> vincenz: you were ping'ing we yesterday, why?
22:54:52 <vincenz> boegel: I was hoping to talk to andy
22:55:20 <vincenz> you mentioned something about being able to contact him
22:56:15 <vincenz> anyways
22:56:17 <zarvok> vincenz: I'm sure you'll be able to get some sleep, jet lag is rough, but sometime today or tomorrow you'll just crash and get back to normal
22:56:26 <vincenz> boegel: he's invited to IMEC for a demo, you can join him :)
22:56:34 <zarvok> vincenz: plus when more info comes out wednesday, I'm positive it will get you excited
22:56:50 <vincenz> zarvok: true 'nuff :)
22:57:22 <vincenz> boegel: along with his supervisor I would presume
22:57:24 <vincenz> koen
22:59:52 <boegel> vincenz: Koen is a really busy man, don't count on him to show up
22:59:59 <boegel> you'd have to plan it long before
23:00:00 * vincenz nods
23:00:03 <boegel> vincenz: a demo on what?
23:00:23 <vincenz> on a tool that andy and I might collaborate with
23:00:28 <vincenz> erm... collaborate on
23:00:54 <boegel> oh, the trace thingie?
23:00:57 <vincenz> yeah
23:01:14 <lispy> vincenz: conversation in #haskell-blah is safe again :)  good night
23:01:24 <vincenz> lispy: night
23:01:28 <boegel> he's been struggling with his own tool for a few weeks now, and he said something about you guys having something in OCaml he can build on?
23:01:36 <vincenz> that would be the idea yes
23:01:38 <boegel> lispy: heh, g'night
23:01:43 <boegel> vincenz: sounds interesting
23:01:53 <boegel> it could be of use to me too, but not right now
23:02:06 <lispy> "...struggling with his own tool..."
23:02:12 * lispy snickers
23:02:17 <vincenz> boegel: well the problem is that we'd need a confidentiality agreement, that's why I can't just send the sources... and instead inviting you for demo
23:03:07 <boegel> vincenz: is that because the tool was developed at IMEC?
23:03:21 <vincenz> yep
23:03:36 <boegel> hmm, bummer
23:03:47 <boegel> I hate those kinda things
23:03:52 <vincenz> yeah
23:03:58 <vincenz> it's something you kinda have to accept if they pay for your phd
23:04:26 <boegel> vincenz: hmm true
23:04:48 <boegel> vincenz: but I get paid too, and I think we are allowed to do anything with the code we write ourselves
23:04:55 <vincenz> yeah but it's a uin
23:04:56 <vincenz> uni
23:05:38 <boegel> oh, well, you should come working for us then :p
23:05:53 <vincenz> heh
23:05:57 <vincenz> if I could do what I wanted with my code
23:06:03 <vincenz> I would put the compiler I've been working on online
23:10:00 * vincenz wonders if he should go to the office
23:11:40 <vincenz> boegel: FWO? IWT?
23:12:43 <boegel> vincenz: I'm currently on a project, but will re-try for IWT this year
23:12:49 <boegel> hopefully I'll succeed this time
23:12:50 * vincenz nods
23:13:13 <dons> ?yow!
23:13:13 <lambdabot> Nobody brings small problems into a laundromat.
23:13:14 <boegel> the problem is, I did my thesis in a totally different departement, and everything was new to me
23:13:25 <dons> oh, i like that one
23:13:26 <vincenz> boegel: ah yeah, I know the feeling :)
23:13:38 <dons> ?remember lambdabot Nobody brings small problems into a laundromat.
23:13:38 <lambdabot> Done.
23:13:40 <boegel> dons: yeah, nice one
23:13:47 <vincenz> well
23:13:49 <vincenz> time for a shower
23:13:51 <dons> very zen
23:13:52 <vincenz> might as well go to the office
23:13:57 <palomer> I don't have floss!
23:14:11 <boegel> vincenz: wait, le me ask you a few questions first (check pm)
23:14:18 <vincenz> k
23:14:31 <dons> so, who wants to guess how many bytes this channel has generated in the last 2 years?

23:18:33 <dons> hthtrshs: generally you should only give it based on some particular event
23:18:38 <hthtrshs> k
23:18:41 <dons> and multiple karms in a row are discouraged
23:18:43 <hthtrshs> but lambdabot is cool
23:18:44 <hthtrshs> :)
23:18:46 <dons> it is
23:21:49 <dons> hthtrshs: learning haskell?
23:21:57 <dons> let me take you on the #haskell tour
23:22:05 <dons> firstly, there's lambdabot , our faithful friend
23:22:11 <dons> > 1=2
23:22:11 <lambdabot>  Parse error
23:22:15 <dons> > 1+2
23:22:16 <lambdabot>  3
23:22:30 <dons> > fix $ \fibs -> 0 : 1 : zipWith fibs (tail fibs)
23:22:31 <lambdabot>    Expecting a function type, but found `[a]'
23:22:31 <lambdabot>    Expected type: [a]
23:22:31 <lambdabot>   ...
23:22:35 <dons> bah
23:22:40 <dons> > fix $ \fibs -> 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
23:22:41 <lambdabot>  [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,...
23:22:43 <hthtrshs> i'm not learning haskell anyway
23:22:49 <Korollary> heh
23:22:58 <dons> why are you hanging out here??
23:23:02 <hthtrshs> mmm
23:23:07 <dons> you already know haskell?
23:23:08 <hthtrshs> i quite like the language
23:23:14 <hthtrshs> i know little haskell
23:23:49 <dons> ok. so you want to soak up the pure fp vibe?
23:23:51 <lispy> > fix $ \fibs -> 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
23:23:53 <lambdabot>  [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17...
23:24:04 <zarvok> he clearly recognizes that haskell hackers are cool people to hang out with
23:24:09 <dons> seems like :)
23:24:59 <lispy> oh, i'm supposed to be a sleep but when you guys did the guessing game i was laughing so loud i think i woke up my neighbor :)
23:25:06 <dons> hehe
23:27:21 <Korollary> you just wont let vincenz get any sleep, will you
23:27:30 <dons> i don't think he wants to
23:27:30 <hthtrshs> <zarvok> he clearly recognizes that haskell hackers are cool people to hang out with --> i prefer c++ ppl, but well :)
23:27:31 <edwardk> btw- dons, it looks like i will be abusing the crap out of your hs-plugins thing. nice interface
23:27:52 <foxy_> @djinn ((a ->b) -> a) -> a
23:27:52 <lambdabot> -- f cannot be realized.
23:27:55 <zarvok> hthtrshs: well, we can't all have good taste in programming languages :)
23:27:58 <dons> ok, interesting ,edwardk
23:27:59 * edwardk has finally figured out how he's going to avoid paying runtime overhead for the javascript stuff
23:28:00 <dons> how so?
23:28:05 <hthtrshs> i know you can't ;-)
23:28:08 <hthtrshs> at least i do :)
23:28:13 <vincenz> Korollary: I doubt I could
23:28:22 <dons> hthtrshs: so, why are you hanging out in #haskell? I'm intrigued..
23:28:37 <dons> you know we talk _lots_ about haskell in here ;)
23:28:42 <zarvok> haha
23:28:55 <foxy_> @type (\_ -> undefined)
23:28:57 <lambdabot> forall a t. t -> a
23:29:09 <edwardk> well, basically looking at using a simple template haskell based code generator to produce haskell from ecma4 code. bundle that with the simple ecma 3 type system, and then use the plugin interface to load the javascript 'packages' (plugins) made by the first part.
23:29:30 <dons> ok, interesting.
23:29:39 <edwardk> then i can use a simple intepreter in lieu of the full fledged template haskell mess for eval
23:29:47 <dons> yep.
23:29:52 <edwardk> basically i need to compile javascript packages or the whole thing will be unusable
23:29:58 <edwardk> so i write the parser once, and share it
23:30:14 <dons> so like lambdabpt's @eval/> but for ecma?
23:30:25 <dons> > 1+2 -- generates a plugin
23:30:26 <lambdabot>  3
23:30:51 <edwardk> then the temmplate haskell thing can walk the parse tree and generate haskell code for a plugin via template haskell
23:31:07 <dons> wacky
23:31:10 <edwardk> or i can just evaluate it by interpreting the parse tree if its 'simple' like 99% of the evals
23:31:15 <dons> audreyt might have some advice on this system.
23:31:16 <vincenz> edwardk: I wouldn't go for th
23:31:29 <edwardk> vincenz: my alternative is that my vtable will suck ass =)
23:32:17 <edwardk> and i'm looking for performance. the major usage scenario will be a large number of loaded pre-loaded packages, which will then compile, the resulting code should have near native haskell performance as long as it doesn't need dynamic classes
23:32:32 <edwardk> THATS what i wanted out of writing it in haskell in the first place =)
23:32:38 <vincenz> edwardk: why th tho
23:32:41 <vincenz> edwardk: just generate plain haskell
23:33:16 <edwardk> well, with th i can use it to let you embed javascript fragments directly in haskell.
23:33:31 <edwardk> something kinda neat about that
23:33:42 <edwardk> and those will be prebuilt, not eval'ed
23:34:01 <edwardk> i lose that feature the other way around.
23:34:38 <edwardk> lets me bury the parse time in the compilation phase.
23:34:46 <edwardk> a trivial gain i admit
23:35:01 <vincenz> edwardk: you can also use the lambdabot system
23:35:03 <vincenz> of dynamic plugins
23:35:09 <vincenz> hsplugins
23:35:21 <edwardk> eval() isn't my problem. its package foo { }
23:35:35 <edwardk> i need packages and classes to compie to an efficient representation.
23:35:45 <edwardk> i'm planning on using hsplugins
23:35:54 <edwardk> its just a matter of how i generate the haskell for the plugin =)
23:36:34 <vincenz> cat
23:36:57 <edwardk> i have to admit this is a HELL of a lot more appealing than the HList stuff i've been doing the last couple days
23:37:05 <vincenz> :)
23:37:24 <edwardk> stands a chance of actually being pretty mind numbingly fast for my standard usage cases.
23:37:58 * vincenz off to work
23:38:17 <edwardk> tricky part is figuring out the js->haskell stage
23:53:35 <Igloo> dcoutts: I don't yet, no
