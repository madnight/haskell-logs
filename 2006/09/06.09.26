00:00:12 <xerox> weitzman: you can have lots of behaviours with that function.
00:00:30 <weitzman> xerox: Well, if you pretend that all bottoms have the same behavior
00:00:39 <xerox> > length [(minBound :: Char)..maxBound] + 2
00:00:41 <lambdabot>  1114114
00:00:45 <xerox> I think this is the number.
00:01:15 <xerox> satan: the unit type.  The only values of type () are () and _|_.
00:01:32 <satan> xerox: ah ok, thanks :)
00:01:55 <satan> monochrom: thanks for your patience :)
00:02:40 <dolio> weitzman's question is probably what the author had in mind.
00:03:18 <xerox> weitzman: about the construction, you might write all of the cases on its own lines, like: f (Left True) = 1; f (Left False) = 2; f (Right (chr 0)) = 3; ...; f (Right (chr 1114112)) = 114114.
00:03:42 <xerox> My english sucks this morning.
00:05:54 <weitzman> satan: I suggest you write a function f :: Either Bool Char -> Bool, turn the page, and consider the problem defeated
00:06:11 <satan> weitzman: ok i'll do that, i'm kinda sick of it myself
00:06:17 <xerox> weitzman: that's not complete :(
00:06:23 <satan> thanks for you all your help, everyone :)
00:06:43 <dolio> Complete?
00:07:13 <xerox> Total, sorry.
00:07:28 <dolio> It would be.
00:07:49 <dons> sjanssen: yikes!
00:07:49 <lambdabot> dons: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.
00:08:10 <dolio> Left True would have the same value as Left False and Left _|_
00:08:46 <xerox> Ah, silly me, of course one can do Char -> Bool.  This conversation is killing me.
00:09:21 <dolio> :) No, the tranlsation is Either -> Bool.
00:09:28 <dolio> The types inside don't matter.
00:09:58 <xerox> e.g. f (Left x) = x; f (Right c) = isLower c
00:10:11 <dons> > runST (unsafeIOToST (return 2))
00:10:12 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `unsafeIOToST'
00:10:16 <dons> sjanssen++
00:10:21 <monochrom> You call that "Either a b -> Bool", not "Either -> Bool"
00:10:58 <Syzygy-> @hoogle Either a b -> Bool
00:10:59 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
00:11:15 <xerox> |Either a b -> Bool| is either |const True|, |const False|, or |undefined|.
00:11:28 <ValarQ> whats the matter with haskell.org ?
00:11:44 <weitzman> See topic
00:11:48 <dolio> I meant that the relevant structure being translated to booleans is contained in the Either portion, not the a b portion. I didn't mean that Either -> Bool would be the type.
00:11:54 <weitzman> Which is to say, nobody knows?
00:12:09 <dons> we don't know why yet.
00:12:14 <dons> since the mailing list is also down.
00:12:32 <ValarQ> oh
00:12:37 <dons> I suspect jealous c++ programmers ...
00:12:49 <dons> not really ;)
00:13:04 <weitzman> Haskell.org has been taking a lot of vacations recently. Maybe its worth finding a friendly ISP to host it
00:13:14 <weitzman> *it's
00:13:20 <xerox> dons: I'm having a course on C++, so I hacked haskell.org for reprisal!
00:14:36 <dons> for those interested, i'm working on a little tutorial on network code in Haskell, using a irc client/bot as a running example. some preliminary code is here, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.html
00:14:37 <lambdabot> Title: Haskell Code by HsColour
00:14:51 <dons> i'd welcome comments on any difficult parts, or bits that are too dumb/hard/simple
00:14:59 <dons>  /messy
00:16:29 <xerox> Cool.
00:16:50 <weitzman> @hoogle Network
00:16:51 <lambdabot> Network :: module
00:16:52 <lambdabot> Data.Graph.Inductive.Query.MaxFlow2.Network :: type Network
00:16:52 <lambdabot> Network.BSD.NetworkEntry :: NetworkName -> [NetworkName] -> Family -> NetworkAddr -> NetworkEntry
00:17:16 <weitzman> I'm trying to deduce the significance of the Net monad, but haskell.org being down makes it harder
00:17:24 <dons> it's my own monad
00:17:37 <weitzman> Well, I guess haskell.org being down doesn't hurt
00:17:38 <dons> it's a state monad over IO, carrying a network socket
00:17:48 <dons> type Net = StateT Bot IO
00:17:48 <dons> data Bot = Bot { socket :: Handle, time   :: ClockTime }
00:18:06 <xerox> abstraction++
00:18:12 <dons> basically, once you connect to the server, you can enter the Net monad
00:18:19 <dons> so computations run with an existing socket
00:18:49 <xerox> ?type gets
00:18:50 <lambdabot> forall a (m :: * -> *) s. (MonadState s m) => (s -> a) -> m a
00:19:00 <xerox> ?index gets
00:19:00 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.State, Control.Monad.RWS
00:19:02 <dons> accesses a component in the state
00:19:06 <xerox> ?source Control.Monad.State
00:19:06 <lambdabot> http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/mtl/Control/Monad/State.hs
00:19:12 <dons> using a selection function
00:19:17 <xerox> Yes, I didn't know it was doable, I see.
00:19:19 <dons> in this case, i use field accessors
00:19:28 <xerox> Makes sense.
00:20:19 <xerox> G'day roconnor.
00:22:20 <dons> weitzman: any thoughts on the code?
00:22:24 <dons> anything mysterious?
00:22:32 <dons> or surprising?
00:23:11 <xerox> How could the `sync better' part be done?
00:23:44 <dons> ah right, so currently both the prompt and the debug info are just dumped to the screen
00:24:02 <dons> i was considering either a) writing to a log file, or b) using a mini curses binding tosplit the console
00:24:25 <dons> since with all the info dumped to the screen, you kind of lose the "irc> " prompt
00:24:33 <dons> perhaps i'll start by logging to a file
00:24:39 <dons> and then at the end add a curses layer
00:25:16 <xerox> If you could keep it modular in the process, so that the core doesn't depend on the UI, it'd be nice.
00:25:22 <dons> yep
00:25:41 <xerox> Hiya dcoutts__.se!
00:26:08 <ValarQ> dcoutts__: godmorgon
00:26:49 <weitzman> dons: In recent versions of GHC, the liftIO is technically optional, right?
00:27:14 * dcoutts__ grins
00:27:24 <Bourbaki> tata dons :)
00:27:33 <Bourbaki> xerox dont you have lectures already?
00:27:48 <xerox> Yeah.
00:27:59 <xerox> I'll be going in some minutes.
00:28:13 <xerox> (I skipped the C++ class this morning.)
00:28:23 <Bourbaki> hehe dont you study math?
00:28:36 <xerox> @babel it en Informatica 1
00:28:39 <lambdabot>  Computer science 1
00:28:44 <xerox> There is this course, though...
00:28:46 <Bourbaki> ah :)
00:29:09 <xerox> The professor is cool, by the way, but he can't talk about his interests :)
00:29:23 <xerox> http://www.di.unito.it/~stefano/
00:29:25 <Bourbaki> why?
00:29:27 <lambdabot> Title: Semantics and Logics of Computation group's (University of Turin) - People - Dip ...
00:29:32 <weitzman> G14 classified?
00:29:38 <xerox> ``Interests: Type Theory, Lambda Calculus and Program Transformation, Logic and Proof Theory''
00:29:48 <xerox> Well, the course isn't about this interesting stuff :)
00:30:05 <Bourbaki> hehe :) you could go into one of his seminars
00:30:19 <xerox> Yeah.
00:30:33 <syntaxfree> Haskell.org has been intermitent lately.
00:30:45 <Bourbaki> i had a cool prof in ai he was quite young also and did a lot of funny seminars two that i proposed also :)
00:30:54 <xerox> Ah!
00:31:02 <Bourbaki> one on coalgebras and one on CT and haskell
00:31:06 <weitzman> Lambdabot need a plugin that will post a notification when haskell.org goes up/down
00:31:11 <xerox> Bourbaki: yarr, sounds fun.
00:31:25 * syntaxfree goes to grad school in economics. 
00:31:49 <syntaxfree> I have an exam on contracts with assymetric information and an exercise list on econometrics.
00:31:53 <syntaxfree> Instead, I'm reading Freyd.
00:31:59 <syntaxfree> I'm really freaking lost.
00:32:18 <xerox> This Freyd? http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FreydsTheorem.html
00:32:20 <lambdabot> Title: Freyd's Theorem -- from Wolfram MathWorld, http://tinyurl.com/gqzro
00:32:32 <Bourbaki> to me economics is like cargo cult :)
00:33:03 <syntaxfree> It isn't, and I'm not gonna waste any time arguing this.
00:33:16 <syntaxfree> In any case, I'm in the wrong career.
00:33:24 <syntaxfree> I'm really passionate about computer programming.
00:34:24 <Syzygy-> Bourbaki: I'd love that CT and haskell seminar.
00:34:34 <Syzygy-> Co-algebras is something I already know a bit about :P
00:34:58 <xerox> Bourbaki: Benoit B. Mandelbrot published lots of books about "fractal interpretation(?)" of economy!
00:35:06 <xerox> http://www.math.yale.edu/mandelbrot/printedbooks.html
00:35:09 <lambdabot> Title: Benoit B. Mandelbrot, http://tinyurl.com/pw9nm
00:35:17 <syntaxfree> and by computer programming I mean type theory and some cat theory.
00:35:26 <Bourbaki> Syzygy- i havent been in this seminar though and i cant access sites at the uni that i havent participated in
00:35:36 <Syzygy-> Bourbaki: Awwwww.
00:35:53 <Syzygy-> xerox: Mandelbrot is one of the very most horrible lecturers I've ever seen in action.
00:36:01 <Bourbaki> xerox :) my prof in game theory also he seems to be a quite known ecomomist
00:36:07 <xerox> Syzygy-: yeah, I agree to some degree.
00:36:29 * xerox craddles his Mr. 'brot authograph
00:36:31 <xerox> :P
00:36:34 <syntaxfree> I do agree that pre-game theory economics is quite hand-wavey.
00:37:02 <syntaxfree> But anyway, by now there are good game-theoretical formulations of most "classical" (post late-19th century) models.
00:37:12 <Bourbaki> the best thing i have ever read in ecomony is a statement of some guy "i have never met the homo oeconomicus"
00:37:43 <syntaxfree> I have never met a catamorphism, either.
00:37:49 <xerox> haha
00:37:55 <syntaxfree> It's called an abstract concept. It's also the last thing I'm gonna say about this.
00:38:26 <Bourbaki> yes but men isnt abstract thats why ecomomy fails so utterly in practice
00:38:54 <xerox> ?remember syntaxfree <Bourbaki> the best thing i have ever read in economy is a statement of some guy "i have never met the homo oeconomicus" <syntaxfree> I have never met a catamorphism, either.
00:39:01 <Bourbaki> :)

01:34:21 <syntaxfree> s/look/luck.
01:36:18 <dcoutts__> dons: so I've got a ByteString discussion/hacking session organised at Chalmers for this Friday! :-)
01:36:20 <dcoutts__> dons: what do you suggest I start talking about & hacking on ?
01:37:25 <syntaxfree> http://www.mathbin.net/831
01:37:37 <dcoutts__> I'll probably talk about fusion since they've already had a talk on the basics & implementation
01:37:37 <dcoutts__> but for the hacking... hmm.
01:37:53 <dons> dcoutts__: oh! cool.
01:37:57 <dcoutts__> @arr
01:37:57 <lambdabot> I'll keel haul ya fer that!
01:38:15 <dons> rl just gave a talk about his fusion of parallel array distributoin code...
01:38:22 <dons> using streams. it was really nice
01:38:37 <dcoutts__> cool
01:38:44 <dons> yeah, fusion. try to get bit syntax on bytestrings done? parsec for bytestrings?
01:39:23 <dcoutts__> @seen bringert
01:39:24 <lambdabot> I saw bringert leaving #ghc, #haskell.se and #haskell 2h 56m 32s ago, and .
01:39:48 <dcoutts__> dons: Bringert suggested the hacking session, I'll ask him if he had something particular in mind
01:40:02 <dons> yeah, he might have some ideas
01:40:24 <dcoutts__> but yeah, parsing or binary stuff is topical
01:41:09 <dcoutts__> dons: or accumulating output like one needs for pretty-printing...
01:41:25 <dcoutts__> speaking of which, have you thought about StringBuilder ;-)
01:42:48 <dons> can I get a mini-me who can answer email and irc queries while I get work done?
01:42:56 <dcoutts__> heh
01:43:03 <dons> but he must be no more than 3 feet tall
01:43:16 <dcoutts__> @dons
01:43:17 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html
01:43:18 <dcoutts__> <dons> time for lunch!
01:43:26 <dcoutts__> wt?
01:43:30 <dons> hmm?
01:43:49 <dcoutts__> ah @docs
01:44:06 <dons> so who can we hassle to solve this haskell.org issue
01:44:28 <dcoutts__> I've looked at it before a bit
01:44:35 <dons> since we can't even get ghc now, maybe microsoft wants to sponsor the server..
01:45:39 <dons> maybe haskell.org is too critical now to have only part-time admin-ing
01:46:04 <dons> since ghc is unavailable, the mailing list is down...
01:46:22 <dons> dcoutts__: "looked at it before" ?
01:48:38 <musasabi> dcoutts__: have a combined parser/prettyprinter structure that is given to TH and produces both?
01:50:00 <dcoutts__> musasabi: mm
01:50:17 <dcoutts__> dons: it's unavailable now ?
01:50:34 <dons> dcoutts__: haskell.org went down about 8 hours ago
01:50:41 <dons> downtime #3
01:50:49 <musasabi> But in general (lazy) bytestring (de)serialization for existing wire protocols would be very useful.
01:51:21 <dcoutts__> dons: it's not totally down, some pings get through
01:51:37 <dcoutts__> musasabi: aye. which in particular would you say ?
01:51:38 <dons> yeah, pings always seem to work. the web server just seems to not function
01:51:51 <dcoutts__> dons: can you ssh in ?
01:51:54 <kosmikus> I can't ssh to haskell.org either
01:52:10 <dcoutts__> dons: previously it was just the web server that had maxed out at 150 connections
01:52:41 <dons> yes, but it has gone down 3 times now, in 4 days. not good.
01:52:55 <musasabi> dcoutts__: decoding is more tedious to do by hand, but implementing efficient encoding might be more fun as that needs more thinking.
01:53:00 <dcoutts__> dons: there seems to be this DOS condition where there are 150 'hung' connections making no progress and thus no new ones can be made
01:53:39 <dcoutts__> dons: the other possability I think is that we're getting 150 connections to things which take a lot of cpu, like getting arbitrary diffs of history of wiki pages perhaps.
01:53:53 <dons> maybe yes.
01:54:02 <dcoutts__> I think I saw that behaviour before
01:54:08 <dcoutts__> and it caused high cpu load
01:54:18 <dcoutts__> and made it hard to ssh in and restart httpd
01:54:26 <dons> hmm. how fast is the server ?
01:54:32 <dons> is it quite old?
01:54:49 * musasabi has tons of code like; decode = c <- getW8; case c of 1 -> a <- getW8; when (notValid a) fail ...; b <- getW32be; c <- decode; retrun Foo b c; ...
01:54:55 <dons> it seems like we'd hit 150 connections with some ease these days.
01:55:30 <gour> shapr nicely said we need haskellforge.org ;)
01:56:58 <dcoutts__> it's pretty ordinary I think
01:57:16 <dons> hmm?
02:01:23 <dons> its strange. sometimes i can get just a little html header from the server
02:01:53 <musasabi> Is it running apache?
02:02:03 <dcoutts__> yes
02:02:23 <dons> so what does that imply? its under high load?
02:02:27 <dcoutts__> I think so
02:02:37 <dons> i.e. DoS.. ?
02:02:57 <dons> and why does the mailing list stop working?

03:11:32 <vegai> musasabi: is the correct idiom in HAppS, as far as data goes, to just define it as a type and make it an instance of StartState and Serialize?
03:12:03 <vegai> will that work for more complex types well?
03:15:20 <musasabi> yes.
03:15:37 <vegai> ok, good
03:16:01 <musasabi> The datatype should have a form that one can serialize (i.e. finite and no functions - or you need to write a serialize instance dealing with that)
03:16:22 <vegai> right

03:17:24 <musasabi> vegai: define accouns. Like a "Map UserName UserData" ?
03:17:31 <vegai> Yes, exactly :)
03:17:33 <musasabi> + sessions
03:18:02 <vegai> agents/SessionKeeper.hs answers that?
03:18:06 <musasabi> data MyApp = MyApp { users :: Map UserName UserData, ... } what more do you need?
03:18:27 <vegai> some form of authentication, I suppose.
03:18:54 <musasabi> "sessions :: SessionState UserName" (etc)
03:19:45 <vegai> yeah... Who wrote the tutorial, by the way? Could a paragraph or two be added about the sessions, perhaps?
03:20:22 <musasabi> Stefan Aeschbacher wrote it.
03:20:22 <es> does ioError return bottom?
03:20:49 <vegai> ok. Thank you.
03:20:54 <musasabi> vegai: contributions would be welcome, I have a todo item about updating the tutorial but it is not very high on the list of things to do.
03:23:08 <gour> dcoutts__: what wifi driver ?
03:23:44 <dcoutts__> gour: na, the driver is fine, I'm just a little far from the AP and we get interference here
03:24:05 <gour> dcoutts__: then, just come closer :-)
03:24:28 <dcoutts__> gour: I'll go sit outside :-)
03:24:39 <gour> dcoutts__: fresh air?
03:24:52 <dcoutts__> between me and the AP, yes.

03:25:52 <dcoutts__> it was a bit cold :-)
03:26:08 <gour> dcoutts__: are you not from England?
03:26:11 <dcoutts__> actually, depending on the pic you mean, that might have been the sea
03:26:32 <dcoutts__> gour: yeah, but that doesn't mean I like swiming in the cold sea! :-)
03:26:55 <dcoutts__> gour: why do you think we come to Croatia to swim in the warm sea ?
03:26:58 <gour> dcoutts__: i mean you must be accustomed to it (cold weather etc.)
03:27:04 <dcoutts__> brrr
03:27:28 <gour> dcoutts__: swimming in Croatia? well, good change .-)

04:41:35 <dons> I proclaim this "#haskell Hack of the Week"
04:41:47 <audreyt> *curtsies*
04:42:20 <dons> yeah, you can have a dictionary of Dictionaries :)
04:43:53 <audreyt> and such a dictionary won't even trigger unused-function warnings
04:44:16 <dons> yeah, its nice. I wonder if there are other applications for this trick
04:44:46 <dons> if any newbies are around who want to get into haskell hacking, here's a little irc bot demo, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.html
04:44:47 <lambdabot> Title: Minimal IRC bot in Haskell
04:45:04 <dons> i'd appreciate any feedback on it, particularly from those learning haskell
04:45:22 <dons> (there'll be a proper tutorial leading up to it tomorrow)
04:46:05 * rahikkala reads
04:46:20 <swiert> dons, audreyt: Consider writing an article for the Monad.Reader
04:46:33 <swiert> I've discussed reviving it with shapr.
04:46:38 <dons> ah!
04:46:41 <dons> swiert++
04:46:50 <dons> hmm, perhaps i could ...
04:47:23 <swiert> I'll be sending out a call for submissions later this week, hopefully.
04:47:29 <dons> yeah ok. good.
04:47:33 <dons> that's a good way to approach it.
04:47:39 <dons> i'll see if I can think of something
04:48:26 <swiert> That'd be great. The deadline will probably be 1st of January - so you have plenty of time.
04:48:39 <dons> ah ok.
04:48:49 <dons> so what are you thinking of? quaterly publication?
04:48:54 <dons> 3-monthly?
04:49:55 <dons> rahikkala: any comments? queries?
04:50:35 <Philippa_> will it still be wiki-based?
04:50:35 <swiert> dons: exactly. Once every three months.
04:50:44 <rahikkala> dons: I'm enough of a newbie that so far I've just managed to figure out what bracket does, so give me some time
04:50:52 <Philippa_> quarterly sounds sensible, even at its most rapid we never managed more than every other month
04:51:01 <swiert> Philippa_: I'd like to switch to LaTeX.
04:51:15 <dons> rahikkala: ah ok :) tomorrow i'll actually write the tut introducing all the pieces, bit by bit
04:51:23 <Philippa_> LaTeX-on-wiki I'm fine with, I'm not so keen on ditching the wiki aspect entirely
04:51:38 <dons> starting with just connecting to the network, then adding in the Net monad, and bracket and so on
04:52:09 <swiert> Philippa_: Sure. I was thinking of putting the pdf on the haskell wiki, with links to discussion pages.
04:52:21 <matthew-_> latex to html should be quite straightforward
04:52:24 <Philippa_> that's still got the same problems
04:52:50 <matthew-_> then docbook
04:52:51 <Philippa_> for example: I use the wiki to pick up constructive criticism before publication. Oh, and PDF just isn't as good for screen readability
04:53:12 <matthew-_> docbook -> latex is ok with db2latex stuff. docbook to html is also easy
04:53:32 <musasabi> Latex = nicer to write.
04:53:42 <matthew-_> very true
04:54:19 <Philippa_> LaTeX support on a wiki good. Having a PDF version good. Not having an HTML version bad, not having a wiki-style process prior to publication bad.
04:54:27 <Philippa_> I think that sums up my stance
04:54:47 <genneth> does anyone know of a good constraints-solving package in haskell?
04:54:58 <Bourbaki> :)
04:55:00 <swiert> I'm pretty fond of latex. The output is perfectly readable on screen. Besides, it would be good to have a nice looking hard-copy magazine, which is not as easy with a wiki.
04:55:04 <Bourbaki> quite concise :)
04:55:05 <genneth> implementing something like alice or oz?
04:55:07 <sieni> especially when you get to fight with all the environments that refuse to work well together
04:55:09 <x3m> dons: came up with any new ideas?
04:55:20 <dcoutts__> ndm: can't ssh in :-(
04:55:20 <dcoutts__> ndm: it gets part way and gives up
04:55:41 <Philippa_> swiert: it's still less readable overall than HTML in a typical browser is
04:56:01 <dons> x3m, i've made the bot a lot prettier, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.html
04:56:01 <lambdabot> Title: Minimal IRC bot in Haskell
04:56:06 <Philippa_> not to mention rather harder to customise if the reader has particular concern - you can't reformat to bigger writing with a PDF
04:56:46 <Philippa_> nor tweak the colours for syntax highlighting with a bit of CSS if you're colour-blind. I probably should look up what PDF does do for accessibility, for that matter
04:58:51 <swiert> I don't really buy your customizability point. When I buy a hard copy magazine, I rely on editors to do a good job. I really don't want to mess about with different fonts and colour schemes myself.
04:59:03 <Igloo> Is the discussion with Paul re haskell.org public?
04:59:22 <Philippa_> yeah, I don't buy many hard copy magazines these days either
04:59:27 <dons> Igloo: yes, but the mailing list is down
04:59:35 <Philippa_> and I'm *not* going to print out the PDFs myself
04:59:50 <Philippa_> at which point you're back on screen and hard copy analogies start breaking down
04:59:51 <Igloo> Oh, good point  :-)
05:00:20 <Philippa_> now, people can and do alter things like default font size in their browser to fit their screen...
05:00:36 * Igloo can alter the size of writing in PDFs
05:00:49 <x3m> dons: nice, main = bracket connect disconnect loop
05:00:49 <dons> yeah, that's not too hard.
05:00:54 <x3m> whats bracket doing?
05:00:56 <Igloo> Admittedly there is a limit before it gets inconvenient, but that it really quite large
05:01:08 <dons> it runs the main loop, but first runs 'connect', and at the end runs 'disconnect'
05:01:10 <Philippa_> depends on the size of your screen, no?
05:01:18 <swiert> Anyhoo - have to go. Bbl.
05:01:21 <dons> x3m, do you like: eval x | ping = pong
05:01:23 <dons> ;)
05:02:13 <pejo> Philippa_, you can always zoom in the pdf.
05:02:16 <x3m> looks good :)
05:02:37 <Philippa_> pejo: we've just been over that. Once you get past the point where a column's taking up the whole screen you're screwed
05:03:07 <dons> x3m, so if you look at the 'eval' function you can see:
05:03:09 <dons> !uptime
05:03:10 <tutbot> 47s
05:03:17 <dons> !id some string
05:03:19 <tutbot> some string
05:04:23 <dons> and of course:
05:04:25 <dons> !quit
05:04:29 <pejo> Philippa_, doh. So much for getting back and stating something obviuos.
05:04:42 <dons> looks like roconnor is a bot. I suspected as much ...
05:05:05 <SimonRC> www.haskell.org is now working!
05:05:14 <dons> yay!
05:05:30 --- mode: ChanServ set +o dons
05:05:35 <x3m> as long as you still easily can add new commands
05:05:52 --- topic: set to '["Join us as we move forward toward the Age of the Lambda", "Haskell - the language of ICFP winners 3 years running", "Logs: http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/"]' by dons
05:06:09 <dons> x3m, yeah, you just hook in more 'eval' branches
05:06:11 --- mode: ChanServ set -o dons
05:06:30 <x3m> yep
05:06:51 <Philippa_> working on making TMR printable seems sensible. Working on fixing TMR to a specific page size doesn't, IMO
05:07:26 <xerox> Philippa_: did you try printing the TMR from the wiki?  It should choose an ad-hoc CSS for the "media."
05:07:31 <dons> x3m, do you have any comments on the code? what bits look strange/ hard/weird?
05:07:36 <Philippa_> xerox: I don't print much stuff :-)
05:07:41 <dons> x3m, particularly from a newbie point of view
05:07:49 <xerox> Philippa_: well, it should Just Workâ„¢.
05:08:04 <Philippa_> but unless I'm misunderstanding, wanting to make things more paper-like is part of why swiert wants LaTeX and not just LaTeX-inna-wiki
05:08:05 <x3m> dons: yeah i have a couple, probably better i put them all in a paste ;)
05:08:15 <dons> ah ok good
05:08:23 <dons> yes, feel free to grab the source and annotate it in a paste
05:08:34 <dons> the src is here http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.hs
05:08:49 <Philippa_> I really don't want LaTeX, I still find the first issue of TMR more awkward than the rest. And I definitely want a wiki available, because that's been really damn useful in getting me to actually do stuff - even if not everything gets finished
05:09:07 <x3m> dons: if you gonna make it a tutorial.. i would maybe consider first writing the code as we did(can exclude the ping answers and sutch) it and then rewrite it like this with everything
05:09:08 <Philippa_> (anyone want to help further flesh out that half-done monad article? Though I might recycle some of it into the next Impure Thoughts column)
05:09:11 <xerox> Philippa_: I do agree completely!
05:09:22 <dons> x3m, yes, that's what i'm going to do
05:09:40 <dons> starting with just connecting to the network, and thenadding a basic command, then structuring it , until bot.hs is the final result
05:09:48 <x3m> yeah
05:21:20 <SimonRC> hmm
05:23:53 <SimonRC> since we have class (Monad m) => (MonadZero m) and class (Monad m) => (MonadPlus m) and class (Monad m) => (MonadZero m) and class (Arrow a) => (arrowZero a) class (Arrow a) => (ArrowPlus a), is there a case for some kind of "meta-typeclass"
05:23:57 <SimonRC> ?
05:30:27 <wilx> rank-n polymorphysm?
05:31:57 <SimonRC> dunno if that would be it
05:32:20 <SamB> SimonRC: you said "class (Monad m) => (MonadZero m)" twice
05:52:29 <dons> x3m, you making notes on the bot.hs ?
05:54:49 <x3m> not yet, i'll make it abit later in an hour or so. i feel i should try to read a few lines about monads and stuff also
05:55:49 <dons> yes, good idea :)
05:55:55 <dons> you've seen yaht?
05:55:57 <dons> ?where yaht
05:55:58 <lambdabot> http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/docs/daume02yaht.pdf
05:56:06 <x3m> yeah, thats the one im reading
05:57:40 <dons> here's some news:
05:57:41 <dons> "        I had to reboot haskell this AM it was really hung. My first
05:57:41 <dons>         assumption is abuse by web crawlers. I have denied access to all web
05:57:41 <dons>         crawlers at the moment while I continue looking further into this
05:57:41 <dons>         and the load is staying low. I'll keep you posted.
05:57:44 <dons> "
05:58:54 <ndm> i can't imagine all crawlers are being evil, i guess it must just be one
06:00:23 <dons> or the load has just gone up?
06:01:17 <dons> maybe hoogle has become sentient and taken over its host?
06:01:26 <dons> and decided serving up requests is not what it wants to do today
06:01:33 <fasta> Why is (++) not implemented as setting a single pointer?
06:01:42 <dons> setting?
06:01:54 <dons> pointer?
06:02:05 <fasta> dons: well, the compiler could do that
06:02:23 <Igloo> You have to walk to the end end of the left-hand list to find the pointer, and the left hand list may be shared so you can't change its end
06:03:01 <dons> yeah, in general you can't mutate structures unless you know they're not shared
06:03:02 <dons> (++) []     ys = ys
06:03:03 <dons> (++) (x:xs) ys = x : xs ++ ys
06:03:07 <fasta> Hmm, so what if you do want to connect two lists somewhat more efficiently?
06:03:20 <dons> you can write your own version/type
06:03:37 <Igloo> Having things of type ([a] -> [a]) is a common trick
06:03:55 <SamB> used by the likes of Show
06:04:01 <dons> e.g. like bytestrings reimplement the [Char] type with arrays, or (.) and ($) are used for O(1) append
06:04:06 <Igloo> e.g. (\xs -> 1:2:3:xs) rather than just [1,2,3]
06:04:31 <ndm> dons: don't joke about that, it may become true one day ;)
06:04:45 <ndm> dons: and then Hoogle will scan the IRC logs looking for people to eliminate...
06:04:58 <fasta> dons: Is ByteString a drop in replacement? Or does it need further modification to code to get it working?
06:05:17 <dons> fasta: here's a O(1) append implementation, as described above, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/stgjvm/ctkl/DLists.hs
06:05:18 <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/n9yex
06:05:34 <ndm> (although seriously, I hope it isn't hoogle's fault!)
06:05:37 <dcoutts__> fasta: not a full drop in replacement, it depends on how your code uses Strings
06:06:00 <dons> and its append is still O(n), though a lot faster :)
06:06:13 <dcoutts__> fasta: if you don't use [] & (:) then it's mostly a drop in replacement
06:06:34 <dons> and your type is [Word8] or [Char], with Char fitting into ascii
06:06:54 <dons> latin-1
06:06:57 <fasta> Hmm, I might consider using it then.
06:08:12 <dons> there probably should be a standard package for DList
06:08:17 <dons> it comes up a lot
06:08:33 <fasta> What's the largest machine GHC runs on in terms of memory and CPU?
06:09:02 <dons> it's been known to run on a $2M sparc64 with 180G ram and 40 cpus. last week.
06:09:13 <dons> do you have something larger?
06:09:18 <dons> ;)
06:10:22 <fasta> dons: is there also something a bit cheaper than that? E.g. in the $10K price range?
06:10:34 <pejo> fasta, as dons just pointed out it runs on Sun hardware, their Enterprise 25000 is even bigger.
06:10:44 <dons> 4 cpu mips box, perhaps, fasta/
06:10:52 <dons> aren't they around 8k or so?
06:11:05 <dons> or a 4 cpu linux server, running x86 or amd64
06:11:07 <Igloo> I'll sell you a 486 for $10k if you like. Fully supported by GHC!
06:11:24 <fasta> I am glad GHC scales :)
06:11:42 <dcoutts__> you can get a 16 core mips box for $3k
06:11:55 <dons> this is the Age of Concurrency, after all. and ghc was born for parallelism
06:12:05 <fasta> Where do I get the mips boxen? I am mostly fed with x86 only.
06:12:17 <fasta> Are we already in the Arge of the Lambda then?
06:12:20 <fasta> er Age
06:12:24 <Igloo> But seriously, if you care about performance with GHC then you probably want IA32 or AMD64 as others have a tendency to bitrot
06:12:27 <dcoutts__> or a 4*6 core sparc for $3k
06:12:42 <dons> yeah, amd64 is a pretty good bet these days, I think
06:12:45 <dons> would you agree, dcoutts__ ?
06:12:50 <dcoutts__> yep
06:13:02 <fasta> Do hardware companies provide patches for GHC already?
06:13:17 <Igloo> Not really
06:13:24 <x3m> dons: it aint
06:13:33 <dcoutts__> no
06:13:34 <dons> fasta, speaking of Love in the Age of Concurrency, I found this little gem recently, http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.functional/msg/20a80be2e0c567f0?hl=en&
06:13:36 <lambdabot> Title: Google Groups: comp.lang.functional, http://tinyurl.com/hga4o
06:13:55 <Igloo> A mips employee was working on it recently, but AFAIK that isn't part of his job
06:14:02 <x3m> dons: it was good a year ago when they were released but today intel core duo kicks their ass unfortunately
06:14:13 <dons> yeah, the duo is also good
06:14:26 <x3m> it outperforms the amd with pretty much today
06:14:31 <fasta> dons: heh, the date
06:14:34 <SamB> x3m: is that not amd64 compliant?
06:14:43 <dons> we used to have a guy paid to write ia64 patches (part time)
06:14:50 <x3m> no idea
06:14:54 <dons> well, he was paid to write anything for ia64, and ghc was one such thing
06:15:26 * dcoutts__ is about to upgrade to a dual core amd64
06:15:28 <dcoutts__> Igloo, oh ths does mips stuff comercially? that figures.
06:15:29 <Igloo> Who's that, dons?
06:15:35 <dons> yeah, 3 months into the haskell era, Jun 12 1990, "Someone asked about whether anyone was working on parallel implementations of Haskell. Good news: we are" :)
06:15:41 <Igloo> dcoutts__: I believe so
06:15:43 <fasta> I was somewhat impressed that the memory requirements were reduced by a factor of 7 between ghci and ghc.
06:16:11 <dons> Igloo: oh,  matthewc , back when the DISY group here was being funded by HP et al to port L4 to ia64
06:16:13 <fasta> (for my application)
06:16:16 <deadbeef> wondering if i can run ghc on OpenWRT
06:16:22 <Philippa> shared-memory parallel haskell seems to me to have some semi-obvious implementations?
06:16:35 <dons> Philippa: yeah, ghc :)
06:16:54 <Igloo> Oh, "used to", right
06:16:58 <fasta> Question remains whether GRIP still exists...
06:16:59 <dons> that's what roman l. is running on the sun beasts. (well, shared memory concurrent haskell)
06:18:24 <dons> using the new data parallel array library, and ghc+smp, he was getting array codes with 3.7 (or .4?) speed up on a linux 4 cpu x86 this week.
06:18:40 <dons> which is really nice, since the code looks much like bytestring code, over arbitrary arrays
06:19:23 <dons> but the ndp library is generating all this shared memory distributing, and thread pooling
06:19:32 <dons> very spiffy, I reckon.
06:19:42 <fasta> Could you also tell me about the weak parts of it?
06:19:52 <pejo> Philippa, Marlow has a quite recent paper on it. He was thinking of problems caused by (lack of) ordering guarantees for many platforms.
06:19:54 <fasta> It sounds a bit too positive.
06:20:06 <dons> oh, the ndp stuff is highly experimental
06:20:22 <dons> normal ghc concurrency on smp is quite stable, I think. Igloo?
06:20:39 <fasta> Does lambdabot also have a "what is" command? I.e. ndp
06:20:44 <dons> ?where ndp
06:20:45 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/project/dph
06:20:46 <Igloo> On x86/amd64 Linux, yes, I think so too
06:21:06 <fasta> dons: not everything has an URL associated with it.
06:21:15 <dons> considering concurrent ghc has had mmm 10 years of development, it's pretty reliable, clean and nice these days.
06:21:26 <dons> more than 10 years. 15 maybe.
06:21:48 <dons> fasta: true. you can add arbitrary strings to @where
06:22:20 <fasta> dons: fsbot in #emacs responds to "What is <some acronym>?"
06:22:26 <fasta> dons: might be useful
06:22:31 <dons> oh, that'd be a good plugin, yes.
06:22:41 <dons> we tried with '@fact' but it was too cumbersome
06:22:54 <dons> yeah, i might add that
06:23:06 <dons> mmm "We have access to a Meiko transputer machine"
06:23:18 <dcoutts__> that is a good result
06:24:34 <fasta> dons: #debian makes use of !factoid
06:24:43 <x3m> "test: <socket: 1920>: hGetChar: end of file" do i shutdown the program in a wrong way or do i just get that message anyway?
06:25:02 <dons> that's ok. normally you'd shut it down with !quit, I suppose.
06:25:20 <dons> or maybe we could setup a nice signal handler to intercept ^C
06:25:20 <x3m> its the old bot, i shut it down with "quit"
06:25:36 <dons> yeah, it just means we close the socket before killing the reader thread
06:25:48 <x3m> okay
06:25:49 <dons> and that throws an exception in the reader, which is waiting on an hGetChar
06:26:07 <dons> pretty harmless, since we're on the way home anyway
06:26:12 <fasta> Might be interesting http://xahlee.org/lang_traf/index.html
06:26:14 <lambdabot> Title: Xah: Computer Languages Traffic Stats
06:26:15 <x3m> yep
06:27:19 <x3m> abit missleading though since comp.lang.c aint that popular among c programmers
06:28:17 <x3m> and comp.lang.c++ is probably even less
06:29:58 <dons> I wonder if Andrew will get some good applications for the haskell job he posted about
06:30:35 <dons> Seems pretty high end, I was scratching my head thinking of suitable candidates.
06:30:44 <dons> Maybe he wants to head hunt someone from Galois... :)
06:30:51 <dcoutts__> heh

06:30:56 <lambdabot> Title: Planning Systems : A QinetiQ Company, http://tinyurl.com/ncoe6
06:31:14 <dons> there's a couple of OS/Isabelle/Haskell guys here at unsw who might be able to do it, but not US citizens, of course.
06:31:39 <x3m> (\x -> x !! 4) (words "testing this for now") if i have something like this, how do i check first so the index exist? i wouldnt want a shorter string to terminate the program
06:31:56 <Thomas2_> dons: most of them are pretty busy atm
06:32:19 <x3m> or rather i maybe have (\x -> x !! 4) (words astring)
06:32:53 <dons> > let safeIndex n xs | n < length xs - 1 = Just (xs !! n) | otherwise = Nothing in safeIndex 2 "fooo"
06:32:55 <lambdabot>  Just 'o'
06:32:59 <dons> > let safeIndex n xs | n < length xs - 1 = Just (xs !! n) | otherwise = Nothing in safeIndex 200 "fooo"
06:33:01 <lambdabot>  Nothing
06:33:07 <dons> Thomas2_: yeah I know :)
06:33:28 <x3m> thx
06:33:32 <dons> x3m, if you need to do lots of indexing, maybe an array is a better idea?
06:33:41 <xerox> x3m: watch this:
06:33:43 <xerox> > elemIndex 'o' "foo"
06:33:44 <lambdabot>  Just 1
06:33:46 <xerox> > elemIndices 'o' "foo"
06:33:47 <lambdabot>  [1,2]
06:33:58 <x3m> no idea im just playing around testing "string manipulation"
06:34:02 <xerox> Oh, that's the other way around.
06:34:09 <dons> > let arr = newArray listArray
06:34:09 <lambdabot>  Parse error
06:34:41 <dons> > let arr xs = listArray (0,length xs-1) xs in (arr "haskell") ! 3
06:34:42 <lambdabot>  'k'
06:34:47 <dons> > let arr xs = listArray (0,length xs-1) xs in (arr "haskell") ! 10
06:34:48 <lambdabot>  Exception: Ix{Int}.index: Index (10) out of range ((0,6))
06:35:17 <dons> I don't like thos Ix{Int}.index exceptions
06:35:21 <dons> they should be prettier :)
06:39:08 <x3m> i wonder if visual haskell works with the express versions of vs
06:39:38 <wilx> Their homepage claimed it does not.
06:39:50 <x3m> ok
06:39:50 <wilx> That the only version that it works with is .NET 2003.
06:39:52 <dons> you could install vim or emacs? :)
06:40:02 <dons> actually, what is the preferred dev setup for haskell on windows?
06:40:04 <dons> ndm?
06:40:15 <x3m> emacs is geeks and vim is about as good as win notepad :P
06:40:27 <ndm> dons: TextPad and WinHugs
06:40:36 <dons> ah right.
06:40:43 <dons> what if I wanted to develop ghc-based stuff?
06:40:46 <ndm> or at least for me :)
06:40:55 <ndm> TextPad, WinHugs and GHC
06:41:25 <ndm> I'm developing stuff with GHC right now, but i often do small test runs in WinHugs first, check it type checks and compiles, check the basics
06:41:30 <ndm> then move to GHC for the bigger stuff
06:41:59 <dons> x3m, you should try out emacs or vim, lots and lots of good hackers seem to find them useful tools.
06:42:14 <dons> ndm, yeah, that's a good idea. kind of ike how I use ghci, but more portable :)
06:42:34 <x3m> dons: yeah people with to much time ;).. naah ive actually run gvim and its okay.. and its decades behind VS
06:42:35 <dons> (rather than checking for hugs and/or h98 compliance as an after thought)
06:42:45 <ventonegro> x3m, vim as good as notepad?
06:42:53 <x3m> ventonegro: that was a joke
06:42:56 <dons> x3m, what kind of features do you find useful in VS?
06:43:02 <ventonegro> x3m, :-)
06:43:16 <sjanssen> > runST (unsafeIOToST (return 2))
06:43:17 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `unsafeIOToST'
06:43:23 <dons> sjanssen++ :)
06:43:33 <ndm> dons: wait til I have guihaskell finished, then it does all this automatically
06:43:46 <dons> I just turned off ST completey, sjanssen (how did that get in there in the first place??!)
06:43:49 <x3m> dons: well, pretty much.. the debuggers are outstanding and it got loads of useful features
06:43:56 <ndm> dons: plus Hugs is much much much faster than GHCi
06:44:02 <dons> it is?
06:44:14 <dons> but you don't get compiled libraries
06:44:15 <ndm> to compile, yes
06:44:19 <dons> so most things seem to run slower.
06:44:21 <dons> ah right
06:44:34 <dons> yeah, loading lambdabot in ghci is fairly painful
06:44:35 <ndm> since if the job takes > 10 seconds I tend to move it over to GHC
06:44:38 <dons> 90 modules, not good
06:45:08 <dons> so i never run things much larger than this irc tutorial bot I posted in ghci. (140 lines)
06:45:09 <sjanssen> dons: well, darcs trackdown should be able to tell you
06:45:10 <ndm> i can load 26,000 line, over 200 modules in about 4 seconds
06:45:16 <dons> ndm, do you run arger things in hugs then?
06:45:23 <dons> very nice.
06:45:26 <ndm> dons: i develop Yhc in Hugs
06:45:38 <dons> right, so that's much faster than ghci
06:45:44 <ndm> yep :)
06:45:50 <ndm> to load, Yhc is too slow to run in hugs
06:45:58 <ndm> my phd project is just doable in Hugs for smaller examples
06:46:03 <dons> ghci works nicer when you are working locally on part of the tree
06:46:05 <ndm> Hoogle is done exclusively in Hugs
06:46:07 <dons> so you can leave the rest compiled
06:46:20 <ndm> still slower to compile
06:46:27 <ndm> and i often end up jumping all over the place
06:46:37 <dons> me too. e.g. in lambdabot.
06:46:45 <x3m> dons: getting compile error on the new bot: 1:16 : parse error on input 'in'
06:46:54 <dons> hmm. checking....
06:47:32 <dons> x3m, perhaps pull again, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.hs
06:47:39 <dons> i just updated it in case.
06:48:07 <x3m> working
06:48:23 <dons> x3m, are you loading it in ghci or compiling it?
06:48:32 <dons> (its kind of nice to test it in ghci, I found)
06:49:44 <x3m> dons: compiling it
06:50:17 <dons> you can also run it in ghci:
06:50:18 <dons> $ ghci bot.hs
06:50:18 <dons> *Main> main
06:50:19 <dons> Connecting to irc.freenode.org ... done.
06:50:21 <dons> ...
06:50:31 <x3m> not working to use it(on quakenet.. that reqired the pong to continue) getting the register first message
06:50:50 <dons> oh, maybe the pong message is broken
06:50:58 <dons> what was the quakenet url again?
06:51:04 <x3m> irc.quakenet.org
06:52:09 <musasabi> What was the correct way to #ifdef for Windows in Haskell sources?
06:53:30 <dons> x3m, ah the trick is to handle pings before trying to join, wasn't that it?
06:53:37 <x3m> yeah
06:55:08 <matthew-_> surely a jabber client would be much simpler?
06:56:16 <dons> irc is pretty easy, you can do it in 10 lines or so
06:56:30 <dons> doing it nicely is more work, but stil pretty simple
06:58:49 <matthew-_> oh ok. for some reason I thought it was a complete monster of a protocol
06:58:56 <matthew-_> not as bad as imap then eh?
06:59:06 <mux> IMAP is pretty simple too
06:59:17 <matthew-_> it has weird macro stuff in it does it not?
07:02:48 <giksos> hi, is there a way to find out the width of the terminal?
07:03:02 <SamB> ndm: I sent you another patch for the Yhc list...
07:03:22 <dons> giksos: in curses?
07:03:26 <dons> or the terminal?
07:03:39 <Thomas2_> matthew-_: a friend of mine once stayed on IRC for a period of time just using telnet
07:03:40 <kpreid> matthew-_: IRC is a very simple protocol; it is, however, awkward by way of not providing *enough* structure, so certain things are messier than a more complex protocol would offer
07:04:04 <Thomas2_> it's a little tricky to do so, you have to be fast with the PONG responses
07:04:10 <dons> yeah! hehe
07:04:18 <dons> that's cool, Thomas2_
07:04:27 <giksos> dons: terminal
07:04:41 <dons> you could just call 'resize', the shell program, I suppose
07:04:47 <dons> or lookup how 'resize' works.
07:06:35 <giksos> resize looks nice. Is there some haskell library function for that as well?
07:07:06 * dcoutts__ ponders type BinaryWriter a = Monad.ContT Strict.ByteString IO a
07:07:13 <dons> not that I know of, giksos
07:07:26 <dons> possibly something in System.Console.* ?
07:08:51 <giksos> I can't find it there. System.Posix.Terminal also seems to have nothing
07:10:23 <x3m> back, got a phone call
07:10:36 <x3m> did you fix the ping?
07:10:48 <dons> not yet, looking for a nice way to do it
07:11:11 <x3m> does this bot support typing in runtime?
07:11:29 <dons> typing text into it?
07:11:58 <x3m> yeah.. maybe it dont need to be in the tutorial or anything but i like it, also using a forkIO for it
07:12:16 <dons> yeah, you could always just add back the forkIO of the reader/shell prompt thread
07:12:22 <dons> and use that to type in the /join #chan
07:12:30 <dons> maybe as an advanced part of the tutorial
07:12:37 <x3m> ok
07:12:44 <dons> (it sort of needs the logging messages to go to either a file, or another part of the screen, though)
07:13:14 <dons> at the moment the new bot doesn't take input from stdin, only from the channel
07:13:25 <x3m> yes thats what i meant
07:13:43 <x3m> i like both io from the socket and stdin
07:13:49 <dons> this ping issue might explain why lambdabot can't connect to some servers (i've had one bug report on this)
07:14:11 <x3m> could be, i remember running into this problem when i wrote my first c++ bot also
07:22:55 <SamB> @tell ndm I sent you another patch for the Yhc list
07:22:55 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
07:24:04 <SamB> dcoutts: what a strange-looking monad you have there...
07:26:33 <dcoutts__> SamB: mmm
07:26:54 <dcoutts__> I'm looking to capture the pattern of lazily generating a list of chunks
07:27:08 <dcoutts__> for building lazy byte strings
07:27:28 <SamB> ... I didn't think ContT was multi-shot...
07:27:31 <Syzygy-> dcoutts__: Are you possibly in Stockholm right now?
07:27:47 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: yep
07:27:53 <Syzygy-> At Mittag-Leffler?
07:28:04 <dcoutts__> aye, hence the hostname
07:28:11 <dylan> "My, that's a strange looking monad you have there." "Yeah, well, that's what I was born with..."
07:28:12 * SamB goes to get lunch for school
07:28:12 <fasta> Question: how does one find bugs that come up after, lets say an hour? I get a pattern match failure that I don't expect.
07:28:15 <Syzygy-> What are you doing there? Not Moduli spaces, are you?
07:28:33 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: no, that's my gf's stuff :-)
07:28:46 * Syzygy- would ask you to at least send my regards to Anders Björner and Alexander Koponen. And the Stockholm ppl at the program... :)
07:28:49 <Syzygy-> Who's your gf?
07:28:56 <dons> I just find this kind of rude for some reason:
07:28:57 <dons> :wineasy2.se.quakenet.org 465 tutbot :No hosts from Asia-pacific on this server, thanks..
07:29:00 <dons> ERROR :Closing Link: tutbot by wineasy2.se.quakenet.org (K-lined)
07:29:10 <dons> K-line my bot, will you!
07:29:22 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: I don't know any of them, I'm just a hanger on :-)
07:29:39 <Syzygy-> dons: Whoa. I know a lot of servers limit to geographically close clients, but that was ... remarkable.
07:29:53 <Syzygy-> dcoutts__: Björner is the director of the institute. Koponen is the local sysadmin.
07:30:10 <Syzygy-> And most of the Stockholm University / KTH participants are either profs or study pals of mine.
07:30:12 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: oh I met the sysadmin
07:30:15 <x3m> dons: where are you from?
07:30:23 <dcoutts__> cool
07:30:25 <dons> sydney
07:30:27 <Syzygy-> dcoutts__: When you see him again, send my regards. (i.e. Mikael Johansson)
07:30:33 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: we went out drinking with them the other week
07:30:35 <Syzygy-> dcoutts__: Who is your gf?
07:30:40 <x3m> oh
07:30:47 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: Elizabeth Baldwin
07:30:54 <Syzygy-> Ah.
07:31:03 <Syzygy-> Coool. And highly unexpected! :)
07:31:08 <x3m> if you update the source i'll test it
07:31:21 <dons> yep, works now. let me upload it
07:31:32 <dcoutts__> she just finished her PhD on some construction related to the moduli space of curves
07:31:39 <skuggi> hey, anyone know if there is a unix shell that interprets haskell?
07:31:47 <dcoutts__> or something. It all goes over my head.
07:31:48 <Syzygy-> dcoutts__: Cooool.
07:31:57 <dcoutts__> skuggi: ghci? hugs?
07:32:17 <dons> skuggi: there isn't. though if you visit haskell.org, and click on 'ibraries and tools', you'll find a number of small shell-like projects
07:32:21 <ndm> SamB: got it
07:32:23 <lambdabot> ndm: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
07:32:24 <dcoutts__> Syzygy-: glad you think so! I find it incomprehensible :-)
07:32:32 <skuggi> dcoutts__: they interpret haskell, but they're not shells
07:32:33 <skuggi> dons: ok
07:33:03 <dons> x3m, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/tmp/bot.hs
07:36:55 * Syzygy- has seen about one presentation involving moduli spaces that made halfway sense to me. But then again, that was very ... handwavy.
07:37:03 <Syzygy-> I wouldn't really dare go to the seminars right now...
07:38:22 <x3m> dons: it still send the join to fast i think, at least it dont join any channel
07:39:18 <x3m> do you have a copy of the source before the last updates you made to it?
07:39:50 <hugoh> why cant i do this? (1 :: Char) : "asasg"
07:40:14 <hugoh> i want my integer to be treated as a char...
07:40:15 <dons> > '1' : "asasg"
07:40:17 <lambdabot>  "1asasg"

07:42:10 <hugoh> thx guys. i really want to do, putStrLn ('nr' : text). where nr is a variable i fetch from a tuple containing an int.
07:42:39 <dons> > printf "%dsome text" (1::Int) :: String
07:42:40 <lambdabot>  "1some text"
07:42:57 <x3m> whats darc?
07:43:09 <ventonegro> @where darcs
07:43:10 <x3m> i just meant if you had a copy as the source looked like 30 min ago
07:43:10 <lambdabot> http://darcs.net/
07:43:28 <hugoh> dons: hmm
07:43:33 <dons> no, I don't. but its in darcs, if you want to pull the repository.
07:43:45 <dons> do you really need the old version, x3m?
07:43:57 <x3m> naah
07:44:03 <x3m> was just gonna check a thing
07:44:19 <x3m> i could manage without it
07:44:27 <hugoh> dons: was that about printf an answer to me? :P
07:44:37 <dons> yep :)
07:45:01 <hugoh> hmm
07:45:03 <hugoh> :)
07:45:12 <x3m> or if you could grab the darcs copy of it if there exist one
07:45:14 <Syzygy-> whoa! I have almost 15000 hits on my blog referred from planet.haskell.org.
07:45:17 <hugoh> so printf is the only way to go?
07:45:26 <x3m> i suppose its like svn
07:45:28 <hugoh> printNumbered tuple = sequence [ putStrLn ('nr' : text) | (nr,text) <- tuple ]
07:45:29 <dons> Syzygy-: huh!
07:45:36 <dons> x3m, yep.
07:45:39 <hugoh> this is what i am working with...
07:45:49 <dons> hugoh: you could just use show and ++
07:46:09 <dons> > show 12 ++ "some text"
07:46:10 <lambdabot>  "12some text"
07:46:13 <hugoh> aha
07:46:18 <dons> and then putStrLn that
07:46:23 <hugoh> aha
07:46:32 <glguy> > shows 12 "some text" -- ?
07:46:33 <lambdabot>  "12some text"
07:46:42 <hugoh> but mine looks nice, i just cant udnerstand why it wont work
07:46:45 <dons> glguy++ -- thinking quick
07:47:00 <dons> because simply quoting a variable name does nothing
07:47:23 <Lemmih> xerox_: ping. Does cabal-server-install work?
07:47:26 <dons> printNumbered (x,text) = putStrLn (show x ++ text)
07:47:50 <ventonegro> Syzygy-, maybe it's the robot that's taking haskell.org down :-)
07:48:05 <Syzygy-> Possibly...
07:48:13 <hugoh> ah! ;)
07:50:07 <hugoh> i tried to do putStr (chr nr) too, but that didnt work...
07:51:36 <ndm> dons: what i love is that your haskell.org down emails only come through after haskell.org is back, guarantees you look sillly ;)
07:52:07 <dons> :)
07:52:22 * dons just realised this too 
07:52:31 <dons> I hope I don't panic Paul.
07:57:58 <x3m> dons: did you fix the channel join?
07:58:32 <dons> it seemed to work here, but i haven't confirmed that.
07:58:47 <hugoh> hmm, why doesnt this work to add a space? putStrLn (show x ++ ' ' ++ text)
07:58:48 <dons> it's a bit late, i'm heading to bed now. but hack away (its pretty easy to get it working ;)
07:59:00 <fasta> Wouldn't it be nice to have a debugger for Haskell, that gives you all the variable bindings for e.g. the last pattern match?
07:59:08 <dons> hugoh: the type of ++ requires it be a string, not a char
07:59:08 <fasta> er pattern match failure
07:59:26 <dons> > show 3++ ' ' ++ "foo"
07:59:26 <lambdabot>  Couldn't match `[a]' against `Char'
07:59:31 <dons> > show 3++ " " ++ "foo"
07:59:32 <lambdabot>  "3 foo"
07:59:51 <x3m> dons: here it connects to the server but dont join any channel
07:59:57 <hugoh> thx! :)
07:59:59 <dons> fasta: just maybe you can do that with Lemmih's breakpoint patch
08:00:21 <fasta> dons: in that already in GHC head of two weeks ago?
08:00:30 <dons> I think so. Lemmih?
08:00:36 <dons> Lemmih: ping
08:00:52 <dons> fasta: there's a paper about it in last week's haskell weekly news
08:00:57 <Lemmih> You'll need Pepe's work for that.
08:01:01 <dons> (sequence.complete.org)
08:01:19 <fasta> Does that mean it already works?
08:01:22 <x3m> dons: i guess thats an adventage of having a forkIO, then you dont really need to care so much about the order they get sent. that handles automatically with the ping pong
08:01:38 <dons> x3m, yep.
08:01:50 <dons> so you're using the new code that handles pings as the come in?
08:02:45 <Lemmih> fasta: Yes.
08:02:48 <x3m> yeah and it stays connected to the server and handles it correct, its just the join channel that aint working
08:03:30 <x3m> before we made the join the channel by stdin, maybe we try to join a channel to fast now
08:03:51 <fasta> Lemmih: I don't see a :breakpoint command in my ghci 6.5
08:03:59 <dons> x3m, yes, maybe.
08:04:35 <Lemmih> fasta: Pepe's work won't be in 6.6.
08:04:58 <dcoutts__> dons: something fun... (IO continuation monad for lazily generating lazy ByteStrings) -> #haskell-overflow
08:07:46 <dons> x3m, you'll just have to play around with the code. try forkIO'ing a reader from stdin, perhaps?
08:07:56 <dons> or delaying the join till you know you've connected
08:08:11 <x3m> i'll fork it
08:09:09 <fasta> What's the overhead on having a call to trace on every normal function call? Will it be a factor of 2 in performance decline at max?
08:09:12 <dons> yep, that's the idea. its toy code, so do as you wish
08:09:38 <defcon8> in haskell-mode, how do I bring the ghci prompt up/
08:09:42 <x3m> btw how is concurrent.STM?
08:09:56 <x3m> that is something for syncing the threads right
08:10:16 <dons> yep. similar (and different) to Control.Concurrent.MVar
08:10:32 <dons> MVars might be easier (there's examples in Control.Concurrent)
08:11:21 <defcon8> anyone?
08:12:01 <Lemmih> defcon8: C-c C-l, I think.
08:12:26 <defcon8> do you know where I can get a haskell-mode guide?
08:12:34 <defcon8> I couldn't find one on the main site
08:14:23 <Syzygy-> http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/CONTRIB/haskell-modes/emacs/haskell-mode.el?rev=1.21;content-type=text%2Fplain
08:14:26 <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/feko6
08:14:31 <Syzygy-> The actual source gives a bit away...
08:15:13 <glguy> anyone that thinks that their webservice should take an xml fragment to specify search criteria needs to be popped in the nose
08:15:23 <glguy> especialy when they don't document the schema
08:16:19 <dons> Igloo: btw, its a good idea not to use CamelCasePageTitles now with the new wiki, you can use My_new_page, and it will get a nicer title of "My new page"
08:16:48 <hugoh> gtg, for for all help!
08:16:54 <Igloo> Aha, please forgive my ignorance!
08:17:24 <Igloo> I can't rename it, presumably?
08:17:28 <dons> i forgive you. but the question is: will the Lords of the Wiki (they of the smiteful edits)
08:17:35 <dons> you can, yes.
08:17:43 <dons> it probably doesn't matter in this case :)
08:18:25 <Igloo> Oh, so I can. But yeah, probably best to just leave it as it's due for deletion in a month or so
08:18:45 <dons> ok. good.
08:18:45 <glguy> when you change urls you break the intarweb!
08:19:11 <dons> luckily MediaWiki handes redirects rather nicely, glguy
08:19:24 <dons> the poor intarweb
08:19:37 <glguy> it will become the disjointwebs
08:20:30 <fasta> Hmm, in about an hour or two I will have a 3.7MB trace....
08:20:40 <fasta> Debugging, can it be any worse?
08:21:47 <dons> it can be better :)

08:25:10 <Igloo> A month is what I suggested to shapr. So probably end of October or something.
08:25:16 <glguy> probably when one of us says "hey shapr, it's about time, eh?"
08:25:28 <gkr> Is there a way to applicate a function n times? something like (f^n) 4?

08:27:32 <matthew-_> what's the wiki being moved to?
08:27:47 <dons> old hawik move to new haskellwiki (aka haskell.org)
08:27:48 <glguy> the new wiki
08:27:55 <Igloo> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell (it moved a while ago)
08:27:56 <lambdabot> Title: Haskell - HaskellWiki
08:28:19 <matthew-_> oh right. is that mediawiki underneath?
08:28:45 <dons> do we tag them with: STOMonad -- already moved
08:28:50 <dons> Igloo: ? or just remove them from the page?
08:28:57 <Igloo> Just delete them
08:29:18 <glguy> broken intarwebs qq
08:29:50 <x3m> dons: where would i put the fork, inside the main?
08:30:12 <Igloo> dcoutts__: Do you know if all the Cabal* pages can be removed from the list already?
08:30:57 <Syzygy-> dons: Oh - you're running the #math mbot are you?
08:31:28 <dons> x3m, something like:
08:31:30 <dons>    loop st    = catch (do forkIO (evalStateT reader st)
08:31:30 <dons>                           evalStateT run st)
08:31:30 <dons>                       (\_ -> return ())
08:31:45 <dons> where 'reader' is your command line reader loop
08:31:53 <dons> Syzygy-: nope, its a lambdabot, but its Cales
08:32:06 <dons> Syzygy-: why? is it misbehaving?
08:32:10 <matthew-_> yeah, looks like it is mediawiki. It's very disappointing that the haskell community is using a PHP-based wiki rather than writing their own. Erlang has an erlang-based wiki, I know of some scheme wikis...
08:32:26 <Syzygy-> No, I just saw your nick in the command-list-adress...
08:32:28 * glguy can't sleep at night
08:32:30 <Philippa> there's never been any one concensus on how to do a haskell wiki
08:32:39 <dons> matthew-_: very disapointing? really?
08:32:39 <Philippa> if you don't mind it being ugly and monolithic it's shockingly easy to do
08:32:40 <Syzygy-> I'm slightly interested in throwing something like that at EFNet at some point in the future.
08:33:08 <dons> matthew-_: there's a bit of talk about setting up a combined wiki+forums in haskell on the ml atm.
08:33:08 <matthew-_> dons: yeah, well ok, not *very*... but I rather expected it. :)
08:33:21 * Philippa says this having written a simple haskell wiki and never got it beyond the "ooh, I could build this nice shiny plugin framework" stage after that
08:33:26 <dons> and there are haskell wikis around , talk to Philippa :)
08:33:47 <Philippa> turned out the shiny [static] plugin framework was actually a real bugger to do right, though
08:33:49 <matthew-_> I know there are Haskell wikis around - I'm writing one!
08:33:52 <dons> I'd rather like to port ikiwiki , make it pretty, and extend the darcs backend..
08:34:10 <Philippa> I mean, part of the model brainfucked shapr silly for something like six months until I made a comment about it being AOP-like
08:34:17 <Igloo> ikiwiki?
08:34:28 <glguy> aka yuckywiki
08:35:21 <dons> Igloo: http://ikiwiki.kitenet.net/
08:35:23 <lambdabot> Title: ikiwiki
08:35:33 <matthew-_> Ahh. I'm doing as much as possible client side. LOTS of javascript! The server only serves and saves the wiki markup, the client does the rest. Ajax-style.
08:35:33 <dons> "It stores text
08:35:34 <dons> files with wiki markup in revision control, and generates html output
08:35:34 <dons> on each check-in.  ikiwiki also has a CGI script for editing via the
08:35:34 <dons> web.  It doesn't yet support darcs - there's a patch floating around
08:35:34 <dons> but it hasn't been officially integrated"
08:35:55 <Igloo> Ah, OK
08:36:10 <glguy> that would stump the script kiddies
08:36:15 <dons> matthew-_: its annoying to be forced into a browser when you write lots of content
08:36:29 * Igloo would like a wiki with darcs or darcs-like integration at a deeper level, so conflicting changes are reported back to the user as conflicts to be resolved
08:36:30 <dons> do you have any thoughts on a revision control backend?
08:36:44 <Philippa> yeah, though having a separate parse-to-HTML prog alongside the wiki'd let you write content in a text editor on your own comp
08:36:47 <matthew-_> dons: I don't follow re being forced to a browser
08:37:08 <dons> having to edit content by using a browswer, instead of editor+revision control
08:37:30 <Philippa> being able to yank out a whole history'd be good, yeah
08:37:32 <matthew-_> Philippa: yep, doing the conversion client side allows for disconnected typing (though not saving)
08:37:35 <dons> you shouldn't have to go online, when you write lots of content, you should just be able to, say, : darcs push page.wiki
08:37:50 <dcoutts__> Igloo, sorry, old wiki / new wiki, what?
08:37:51 <glguy> that doesn't sound very web2.0
08:38:01 <dons> heh
08:38:06 <matthew-_> dons, that's getting closer to a distributed tiddlywiki type idea no?
08:38:18 <Igloo> dcoutts__: There are a number of Cabal* pages listed on http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaWikiMigration
08:38:21 <lambdabot> Title: HaWikiMigration - HaskellWiki, http://tinyurl.com/gzhlf
08:38:36 <Igloo> dcoutts__: On the old hawiki. Can they be removed?
08:38:39 <x3m> @paste
08:38:40 <lambdabot> http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell
08:38:46 <dons> possibly, clearly editing online is good for casual users, but its really annoying to not be able to a) check out multiple pages b) check in multiple pages in one go
08:38:51 <glguy> dons: when I write some big commonly used software, remind me to give it a homosexual sounding name
08:38:59 <dcoutts__> Igloo: i'll check
08:39:03 <x3m> now the paste site dont work
08:39:05 <Igloo> OK, thanks
08:39:08 <dons> glguy: ok. will do.
08:39:33 <dons> ?paste
08:39:33 <lambdabot> http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell
08:39:35 <matthew-_> dons: yes I agree.
08:39:55 <dons> for example, MediaWiki (which we currently use) is really bad at multiple pages.
08:40:11 <dons> so i just save them all to disk, create a new darcs repo, edit my multi-page stuff, then check it all in via w3m
08:40:13 <Igloo> dons: So would you allow a single commit to affect multiple pages?
08:40:15 <matthew-_> I'm not aware of any wikis that are really good at multiple pages
08:40:32 <dons> Igloo: I think a darcs model would be best, yes. its the patch that is key.
08:40:36 <matthew-_> what happens if you have a mid-air collision?
08:40:42 <glguy> the darcs requirement could be used as a basic competency test?
08:40:56 <x3m> dons: is there any haskell spam channel?
08:40:59 <matthew-_> do you want to make the patchset useful for the end browser?
08:41:07 <dons> x3m, yep, #haskell-overflow
08:41:25 <dons> I think you could present the usual history and so on (much like darcs-cgi)
08:41:41 <dons> and users could edit single pages online, as is custom, generating a patch to check in
08:42:01 <dons> but the important thing would be to make it easy for developers to write seriously, large amounts of content
08:42:27 <matthew-_> so for each session, they get a darcs copy of the entire site?
08:43:02 <dons> if you wanted to edit locally, then you should be able to just: darcs get --partial http://my.wiki
08:43:05 <glguy> the firs session they do
08:43:11 <glguy> teh second session they just need the changes
08:43:13 <matthew-_> presenting the patch set and dealing with merging could be tricky via a web interface
08:43:16 <dons> and then yeah, they have a recent history.
08:43:36 <dons> and later they: darcs pull, pulling in changes since.
08:43:51 <glguy> this is like Web 5GL
08:44:01 <glguy> I like it
08:44:03 <dons> so, you start with distributed revision control, and add an online interface for the more casual users
08:44:09 <dons> hehe
08:44:15 <Igloo> You can only edit a single page with the web interface, and if you try to commit but have conflicts then it throws back your content with conflict markers in
08:44:16 <matthew-_> yes, you'd really want a javascript implementation of darcs so that the clients really do pull the site down and then commit back
08:44:20 <dons> ?remember glguy this is like Web 5GL. I like it
08:44:34 <Igloo> Of course, things get trickier if you add move-hunk to darcs
08:44:44 <Igloo> (inter-file-move-hunk, that is)
08:44:51 <dons> yeah, Igloo, getting back the conflict markers would be good
08:45:07 <dons> matthew-_: you still want to run it in the browser ;)
08:45:11 <matthew-_> yes.
08:45:30 <matthew-_> it's a wiki - it's /meant/ to be in a browser ;)
08:45:40 <x3m> dons: i pasted a working link in overflow
08:46:19 <matthew-_> besides, browers are the universal platform in these heady days of web2.0
08:46:21 <dons> matthew-_: yeah, if the browser interface ran as nicely as using darcs locally, that would be cool. but seems too hard...
08:46:26 <MarcWeber>     showsPrec :: integral -- ^ the operator precedence of the enclosing context (a number from @0@ to @11@).
08:46:31 <glguy> ruby on rails can keep web2gl
08:46:43 <glguy> I like the idea of darcs wiki
08:47:03 <MarcWeber> operator precedence: where is this used? When formatting output to decide wether to break a line?
08:47:37 <glguy> operator precedence makes 1 + 2 * 3  equal 7
08:48:20 <matthew-_> dons: of course, we really need a javascript implementation of emacs and vim first... ;)
08:49:43 <dons> maybe browsers aren't meant to be an OS
08:49:49 <dons> we'll see..
08:50:12 <Philippa> browsers are going to become one anyway, at least in the same sense emacs is one
08:50:15 <Philippa> they're already a platform
08:50:19 <glguy> MarcWeber: for what it's worth, the precedence value is not used in the Prelude
08:50:41 <defcon8> does a function always have to be called with the same amount of arguments
08:50:42 <defcon8> ?
08:50:43 <bartw> we should make an umvm in javascript ;p
08:50:57 <glguy> heh, except for instances of Integral
08:51:33 <Philippa> defcon8: in the sense you mean, yes
08:51:44 <Philippa> more strictly, all functions have exactly one argument anyway
08:51:45 <defcon8> damn
08:52:01 <glguy> > show (3%4)
08:52:05 <bartw> Philippa : so what is a function with no arguments ?
08:52:08 <lambdabot>  "3%4"
08:52:11 <Philippa> bartw: no such thing in haskell
08:52:16 <glguy> > showsPrec 8 (3%4)

08:52:27 <lambdabot>  "3%4"
08:52:27 <bartw> no a:: char ; a = 'a' ?
08:52:37 <Philippa> a is a value, not a function
08:52:47 <glguy> MarcWeber: in this case, the precedence value determines if parenthesis are needed
08:52:50 <bartw> isn't a value a zero argument function ?
08:52:54 <Philippa> all your bindings are to values - some of those values are functions
08:52:55 <Philippa> no
08:53:06 <Philippa> "zero argument function" is meaningless in haskell
08:53:18 <bartw> hmz, time to change the mental model once again
08:53:34 <bartw> i was seeing thunks as zero argument functions
08:53:35 <Philippa> the only reason we talk about functions with two or more arguments is the isomorphism between functions taking tuples of arguments and curried functions
08:53:42 <roconnor> bartw: I would agree that a value is a zero arguement function
08:53:43 <Cale> Philippa: unless you just want to consider non-function values as zero-argument functions
08:53:44 <Philippa> they would be in C, if that helps
08:53:55 <defcon8> would the pattern (_:x) be valid?
08:53:59 <glguy> > ( 3%4, 3:%4)
08:54:00 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: data constructor `:%'
08:54:00 <Philippa> defcon8: yes
08:54:02 <glguy> defcon8: yes
08:54:05 <defcon8> thank you
08:54:10 <Cale> Like, perhaps "hello" :: String is a zero-argument function
08:54:30 <Philippa> Cale: you're not really talking about functions in the sense meant in haskell any more though. It works fine if you're talking about what-C-calls-functions
08:54:31 <Cale> But that's mostly just confusing, and not really all that useful :)
08:54:41 <defcon8> ?hoogle contains
08:54:42 <lambdabot> No matches found
08:54:47 <defcon8> what is the member of function?
08:54:50 <bartw> righty, no -> no function
08:55:02 <Cale> @type elem
08:55:04 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool
08:55:16 <roconnor> well, assuming f::a -> b -> c is a two argument function
08:55:30 <roconnor> the other resonable point of view is that haskell only has one argument functions.
08:55:37 <Philippa> roconnor: that one's isomorphic to a function on a 2-tuple though
08:55:43 <glguy> > let contains needle haystack = any (isPrefixOf needle) (tails haystack) in contains "as" "trsAaSasNM"
08:55:45 <lambdabot>  True
08:55:47 <glguy> > let contains needle haystack = any (isPrefixOf needle) (tails haystack) in contains "as" "trsAaSaNM"
08:55:48 <lambdabot>  False
08:56:06 <Philippa> you need an entirely different isomorphism to make 0-argument functions make sense
08:56:25 <roconnor> Philippa: is this because of bottom?
08:56:40 <Philippa> no, it's because you don't apply values to anything when you use them
08:56:40 <defcon8> antone?
08:56:41 <defcon8> anyone*
08:56:46 <glguy> defcon8: what ?
08:56:54 <defcon8> member of function
08:56:59 <Cale> defcon8: didn't I just answer your question?
08:57:00 <defcon8> to find if x contains y
08:57:01 <glguy> > 3 `elem` [1..10]
08:57:02 <lambdabot>  True
08:57:09 <roconnor> a is isomorphic to () -> a, a 0-tuple function.
08:57:09 <defcon8> Cale, sorry, I didn't notice
08:57:11 <defcon8> please pardon me
08:57:24 <Philippa> roconnor: now look at the term translation
08:57:26 <Cale> I suppose I could have pointed it out better :)
08:57:38 <defcon8> yeah
08:57:51 <roconnor> iso1 a = \x:() -> a, iso2 f = f ()
08:58:02 <defcon8> what about removing an element?
08:58:22 <glguy> MarcWeber: in case you still cared: The representation will be enclosed in parentheses if the precedence of the top-level constructor in x is less than d. Thus, if d is 0 then the result is never surrounded in parentheses; if d is 11 it is always surrounded in parentheses, unless it is an atomic expression (recall that function application has precedence 10). The extra parameter r is essential if tree-like structures are to be printed in linear time rathe
08:58:30 <glguy> defcon8: delete
08:58:51 <roconnor> iso 1 f = \x::(a,b) -> f (fst x) f (snd), iso2 f = \x -> \y -> f (x,y)
08:58:52 <defcon8> (_:0:_) == [4,2,7,0,1]   <-- why doesn't that work?
08:59:02 <roconnor> Philippa: the translation look similar to me
08:59:14 <Philippa> similar, but it's not the same isomorphism
08:59:14 <glguy> defcon8: first of all, the first _ can only be one element
08:59:24 <glguy> defcon8: second of all that isn't how pattern matching works
08:59:24 <defcon8> damn
08:59:29 <defcon8> okay
08:59:32 <Philippa> you *can* (and canonically do) build up 3+parm funcs just from the 2-parm isomorphism
08:59:36 <defcon8> ?hoogle elem
08:59:37 <lambdabot> Prelude.elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
08:59:37 <lambdabot> Array.elems :: Ix a => Array a b -> [b]
08:59:37 <lambdabot> List.elemIndex :: Eq => a -> [a] -> Maybe Int
08:59:44 <defcon8> ?hoogle delete
08:59:45 <lambdabot> List.delete :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [a]
08:59:45 <lambdabot> Data.HashTable.delete :: HashTable key val -> key -> IO ()
08:59:45 <lambdabot> Data.IntMap.delete :: Key -> IntMap a -> IntMap a
08:59:48 <Philippa> can't do that for the 0-parm one, even though it looks similar
09:00:01 <Philippa> you're having to explicitly add a smaller case
09:00:36 <glguy> defcon8: delete removes one instance, filter processes the whole list
09:00:40 <roconnor> iso 1 f = \x::(a,b,c) -> f (fst3 x) (snd3 x) (trd3 x), iso2 f = \x -> \y ->  \z -> f (x,y,z)
09:00:48 <MarcWeber> glguy: Thanks Yes,  I still care. I was reading about that  function precedence at the moment. Your message has beeen trunccated ;( (?)
09:00:59 <roconnor> Do don't see what the 3 parameter function has to to do with 2-tuples
09:01:23 <Philippa> it's not quite an isomorphism due to bottom either, but we don't really care about when the dummy parm gets used and doesn't terminate, right? :-)
09:01:24 <defcon8> glguy, thanks
09:01:36 <roconnor> Philippa: I never consider bottom.
09:01:45 <defcon8> when I try to load the haskell file with using List.delete, it says that it is not in scope
09:01:53 <defcon8> delete doesn't work either, but List.delete worked on ghci prompt
09:02:05 <glguy> import Data.List
09:02:22 <Philippa> FWIW, your isomorphism's actively useful - it's the common translation of lazy evaluation into a strict language
09:02:46 <Philippa> roconnor: consider how 3-tuples are traditionally built from 2-tupling
09:02:52 <defcon8> glguy, thanks
09:02:57 <Philippa> (either way, they're isomorphic)
09:03:02 <roconnor> Philippa: I don't care about strict languages (because I don't care about bottoms) ;)
09:03:37 <defcon8> how do I get help on a function from ghci?
09:03:45 <Philippa> the traditional currying isomorphism only applies to pairs because it only needs to apply to pairs, basically
09:04:11 <roconnor> Sure, tupples are build from 2-tupples and ().
09:04:13 <Lemmih> defcon8: You don't.
09:04:29 <defcon8> okay
09:04:34 <roconnor> thus () , (a,()), (b,(a,()), (c,(b,(a,())))
09:04:42 <roconnor> and it is all natural
09:04:51 <roconnor> notice it begins with 0 tupples
09:04:54 <Philippa> actually you only need () if you have a notion of 1-tuple
09:04:57 <Philippa> haskell doesn't
09:05:17 <Philippa> () could be any datatype with a single no-parm constructor
09:05:30 <roconnor> Philippa: Haskell just doesn't have it in the prelude with synatic sugar, but it is a fine data type and could be added.
09:05:45 <roconnor> doesn't have a 1-tuple..
09:06:06 <Philippa> you're still left trying to deduce a () case from an isomorphism involving pairs
09:06:16 <roconnor> Philippa:  and (a,b) could be any datatype with a single parametric 2-param constructor.
09:06:51 <roconnor> Philippa: ?, () is the base case, there are 0 pairs at that point.
09:07:02 <Philippa> () is *your* base case. It doesn't appear in the currying isomorphism
09:07:12 <ndm> haskell.org seems to be getting slower and slower...
09:07:25 <Philippa> you don't need () to define the n-tuples where n>=2
09:07:28 <roconnor> Philippa: fine, I can rewrite my isomorphism
09:07:35 <lisppaste2> defcon8 pasted "why only work with positive n's and 0?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/26820
09:07:38 <Philippa> and then we're not talking about currying any more
09:07:40 <MarcWeber> ndm: Perhaps there are more and more haskell users? ;)
09:07:44 <roconnor> you don't need pairs to define n-tupples wehre n > 2.
09:07:59 <ndm> MarcWeber: i suspect its not such a sudden occurance,  unless its related to Uni's going back
09:08:12 <Philippa> no, but then you're a bit stuck applying the currying isomorphism to them
09:08:17 <roconnor> Philippa: I sort of see what you are getting at.
09:08:46 <Philippa> what I'm getting at is more or less "but then you may as well start using C's notion of function"
09:09:31 <defcon8> can anyone look at my code?
09:10:20 <Igloo> ndm: Can all the Yhc* pages listed on http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaWikiMigration be treated as having already migrated?
09:10:23 <lambdabot> Title: HaWikiMigration - HaskellWiki, http://tinyurl.com/gzhlf
09:10:31 <Philippa> which, granted, a lot of us often do informally when talking about monadic code
09:10:36 <ndm> Igloo: yes
09:10:41 <Igloo> Cool, thanks!
09:10:58 <Philippa> well, for really sloppy values of "C's notion of function", but hey
09:11:26 <roconnor> What is C's notion of a function?
09:11:37 <Philippa> there, I shall defer to the ISO C standard :-)
09:11:56 <ndm> Igloo: and once i can actually view that page, i'll say what other things have been moved...
09:12:06 <Philippa> but I'm mostly referring to "a thing that takes 0 or more parameters, causes arbitrary side-effects and may return a value"
09:12:06 <roconnor> ugh
09:12:11 <roconnor> right
09:12:31 <Igloo> ndm: Cool, thanks. What's the display problem?
09:12:51 <ndm> Igloo: haskell.org going down...
09:12:51 <Philippa> when we're talking haskell it's pretty important remembering that that's not what we mean by function most of the time and certainly not when we're reasoning from the properties of a function
09:13:54 <Igloo> ndm: WFM at the minute
09:14:03 <roconnor> okay
09:14:28 <ndm> WFM?
09:14:35 <Igloo> Works For Me
09:14:55 <ndm> DFM :(
09:14:57 <Igloo> ndm: Feel free to just delete them from that page rather than telling me, BTW
09:15:05 <ndm> sure, will do
09:15:08 <Igloo> Odd
09:15:15 <Philippa> it takes about the same amount of reasoning to get from haskell complete with monads to that definition of function as it does to one that talks about 0-argument pure functions
09:15:30 <Philippa> worse: if it actually has zero arguments, it just ain't a pure function any more
09:15:32 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: Hiya. My first stab at a new hackagedb is online: http://hackage.homedns.org/
09:15:35 <lambdabot> Title: Libraries and Tools for Haskell
09:16:05 <defcon8> can someone help me with my code, please?
09:16:07 <Philippa> the fact it could be one is the difference between applying runST or leaving it as an action :-)
09:16:49 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: cool!
09:17:00 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: Are the categories broken, or do none of them list categories?
09:17:32 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: maybe on the front page, instead of "view" it should have "Unstable", "Testing", etc., for the section?
09:18:01 <defcon8> :(
09:18:02 <SyntaxNinja> oh, so you query multiple repositories it looks like?
09:18:09 <ndm> Lemmih: why not have View as the front page? why tell someone about a name, when the good stuff is the data in there
09:19:47 <ndm> is haskell.org working for anyone else?
09:20:02 <SyntaxNinja> ndm: wfm
09:20:04 <glguy> it is
09:20:10 <Lemmih> It is for me.
09:20:21 <Igloo> Lemmih: Neat; what's it written in OOI?
09:20:29 <Lemmih> Igloo: Haskell.
09:20:31 <glguy> ndm, are you trying to crash the site by gettign everyone in #haskell to visit it right now?
09:20:41 <dons> ndm, yes?
09:20:47 <Igloo> Lemmih: But any libraries, or just all by hand?
09:20:56 <ndm> so haskell.org just hates me then...
09:20:58 <dons> ndm, it loads...
09:21:02 <Lemmih> Igloo: I'm using libxml2 and libxslt.
09:21:04 <ndm> i get nowhere
09:21:10 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: search doesn't work
09:21:13 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: I know.
09:21:14 <dons> ndm, maybe authors of hoogle-bots are blocked?
09:21:16 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: this is awesome. great start.
09:21:35 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: could you put something like "Listing packages 1-25 of 50" or whatever?
09:21:47 <ndm> dons: :( - i'm actually writing the new hoogle right now, much better performance for dying servers :)
09:21:58 <Igloo> Lemmih: The C libraries? How do you generate teh XML then?
09:22:41 <Lemmih> Igloo: I have Haskell bindings to the libraries.
09:22:51 <Igloo> Lemmih: BTW, small point, but if those libraries have a flag to generate nicely formatted XML then I'd prefer it (although there is a counter-argument about bandwidth use)
09:23:16 <dons> very nice Lemmih
09:23:26 <Igloo> Ah, I see, so you can construct XML with them rather than pointing them to a file. Makes sense. Cool  :-)
09:23:30 <Lemmih> Igloo: I've been looking for such an option. Haven't found it though (:
09:24:43 <glguy> warning, presurized yogurt may spray all of you and your office
09:25:00 <dfranke> Is there any sort of proposed standard regarding where in hierarchy to put new modules?
09:25:15 <SyntaxNinja> dfranke: we should start one!
09:25:16 <dons> dfranke: yes. check haskel.org's libraries and tools page, at the bottom
09:25:24 <SyntaxNinja> oh hm
09:25:45 <glguy> SyntaxNinja: a little competition never hurt anything... make a competing one!
09:26:05 <Igloo> Sure, there are only 3 already  :-)
09:26:21 <dons> we could have a proposal about which proposal to follow
09:26:25 <dfranke> dons: thanks
09:26:38 <Igloo> dons: I think we should elect a committee to decide that
09:27:16 <dons> Igloo: good idea!
09:27:33 <dons> i'll propose a motion to select the comittee
09:27:44 <dons> let me just put up a proposal for that.
09:28:01 <glguy> Move to table indefinitely
09:28:08 <SyntaxNinja> I PROPOSE A SECOND!
09:28:13 <SyntaxNinja> @type snd
09:28:15 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a, b) -> b
09:28:22 <glguy> @type second
09:28:23 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) c d b. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a (d, b) (d, c)
09:28:38 <SyntaxNinja> all in favor of  forall b a. (a, b) -> b say 'i'
09:28:56 <glguy> all in favor of forall (a :: * -> * -> *) c d b. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a (d, b) (d, c)
09:28:59 <glguy> say 'j'
09:29:11 <SyntaxNinja> glguy: take it to #haskell-blah. you're off topic ;)
09:29:20 <glguy> hey, let'
09:29:27 <glguy> let's keep this germain
09:29:29 <SyntaxNinja> so let's see. is there only one libraries page on haskell.org these days?
09:29:48 <SyntaxNinja> there used to be like 3, one on the wiki, hackageDB, and one at haskell.org/libraries
09:30:25 <dons> hmm, just the wiki?
09:30:26 <defcon8> is parallel list comprehension standard?
09:30:37 <glguy> it's not haskell98
09:30:38 <dons> at least, i've been trying to keep the wiki up to date for the last 10 months
09:30:53 * ndm finally gets back to haskell.org
09:31:02 * defcon8 will not be able to use it
09:31:16 <dons> defcon8: just use a zip then
09:31:23 * ndm looses connection to haskell.org seconds later...
09:31:24 <dons> (its sugar for zip)
09:31:36 <glguy> defcon8: use: [ a+b | (a,b) <- zip [1..4] [4..8]]
09:31:48 <Igloo> ndm: Have you tried tracerouting?
09:32:01 <ndm> Igloo: windows :)
09:32:07 <glguy> tracert?
09:32:10 <dons> I suspect hoogle is attacking its creator and master, now that it controls haskell.org
09:32:13 <ndm> i can ping fine
09:32:22 <defcon8> thanks
09:32:24 <Igloo> There are loads of traceroute programs for Windows
09:32:24 <glguy> ndm: tracert is traceroute for windows
09:32:32 <dfranke> ok, I'm putting in a vote for Simon Marlow's guide and calling this Codec.Encryption.GCrypt.
09:32:32 <glguy> ndm: and tracert is a standard command
09:32:34 <Igloo> Oh, that's interesting
09:33:12 <ndm> and i managed to tracert in
09:33:16 <dons> dfranke: ping dcoutts__, he looked into this just last week.
09:33:19 <dons> for the bzip2 stuff
09:33:28 <glguy> (windows isn't *that* far behind openbsd)
09:33:49 <dfranke> glguy: that's because Windows largely *is* openbsd :-)
09:33:57 <glguy> lawls
09:34:36 <glguy> and visual basic is 5GL
09:35:29 <dcoutts__> dfranke: what's the issue?
09:35:42 <ndm> is there any reason not to put a default Setup.hs file into base?
09:35:55 <dcoutts__> yes
09:36:09 <dfranke> dcoutts__: deciding where in the hierarchy to put my libgcrypt bindings.
09:36:28 <ndm> dcoutts__, was that a yes to me? and if so, whats the reason?
09:36:33 <dcoutts__> dfranke:  that looks like the right place
09:37:00 <dcoutts__> ndm: how would it help ?
09:37:10 <Stinger_> hah at me typing haskell into bash and wondering why its not working :(
09:37:21 <ndm> dcoutts__, runhaskell Setup configure, runhaskell Setup haddock, runhaskell Setup haddock --hoogle
09:37:24 <ndm> at the very least!
09:37:46 <dcoutts__> ndm: there is a suggestion that there should be a command line tool and that this would allow packages that use the default Setup.hs to omit the file
09:38:03 <dcoutts__> ndm: a top level module like Setup would be bad.
09:38:03 <Igloo> Does that actually work, ndm?
09:38:05 <ndm> dcoutts__, suits me fine, but until there is, why not shove a default Setup.lhs file in base?
09:38:16 <dcoutts__> namespace pollution
09:38:16 <ndm> Igloo: yes, its how i'm generating hoogle databases
09:38:25 <dons> ndm, how would it work?
09:38:28 <ndm> dcoutts__, base should probably all be in src
09:38:37 <dcoutts__> huh?
09:38:45 <ndm> dons: it does work, today, just runhaskell Setup configure, runhaskell Setup haddock --hoogle
09:39:00 <ndm> dcoutts__, i.e. the source files should probably be in base/src, not in the root of base
09:39:01 <dons> if Setup is in the current dir , and is a source file
09:39:02 <SyntaxNinja> dons: cool
09:39:10 <glguy> ?hoogle urlencode
09:39:10 <lambdabot> No matches found
09:39:11 * Igloo sees little reason not to add it then, although you probably want the withHooks one
09:39:41 <ndm> Igloo: whatever basic one does me fine, there nothing in it thats needed by me
09:39:44 * dons realises ndm was talking about something else entirely
09:40:07 <Igloo> ndm: You might want to check hugs still builds with whatever you use, that's all
09:40:21 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: I'm not sure I completely grok the organization of repositories.
09:40:39 <ndm> Igloo: never checked that, thats something for Cabal experts etc, i can barely build hugs libraries, they regularly fall over and break
09:40:45 <dcoutts__> ndm: you do mean adding a module 'Setup' to the module namespace of the base package right? I'm not sure what you mean about src/
09:40:55 <Igloo> Lemmih, SyntaxNinja: I'd propose just having an unstable repo for now, and worry about fancy migration etc once that works
09:41:22 <ndm> dcoutts__, oh, no! just in teh base package, so you can build bits of base with cabal
09:41:28 <ndm> dcoutts__, not expose it from base
09:41:31 <glguy> anyone know how to include a domain name in http://user:password@host/path ?
09:41:35 <dcoutts__> ndm: oh ok, I was confused
09:41:50 <dcoutts__> ndm: well when we can build base or bits thereof with Cabal then fine
09:42:09 <dcoutts__> that's not up to me, that's for the people hacking on the base package
09:42:09 <ndm> dcoutts__, we already can, not build as in compile, but build asi n haddock
09:42:28 * Lemmih takes off to find food.
09:42:29 <dcoutts__> what are the remaining problems btw ?
09:47:57 <ndm> Igloo told me there were issues in GHC, Cabal and Base :)
09:49:13 <Igloo> Oh, that reminds me, what does the "quarters" in HQ, "officer's quarters", "general quarters" etc mean?
09:50:29 <ndm> quarters is just a location
09:50:43 <Igloo> Why, though?
09:50:48 <ndm> no idea :)
09:50:54 <ndm> you suspect at some time there were 4 of them
09:51:12 <ndm> oh, and when i said haddock can generate the base library, i lied, it crashes - you need HEAD haddock plus a small patch
09:52:08 <dcoutts__> anyone grok continuation monads well ?
09:52:41 <dcoutts__> I'm trying to do some operation that I can do if I use the internals of the monad, but I'm wondering if I can do it with just callCC
09:53:08 <dcoutts__> yield :: a -> M a ()
09:53:08 <dcoutts__> yield a = M (\c -> do as <- unsafeInterleaveIO (c ())
09:53:08 <dcoutts__>                       return (a : as))
09:53:44 <dcoutts__> ie suppose I don't look inside the M constructor, but just use the monad from the outside. it supports liftIO, and callCC etc
09:54:14 <dcoutts__> maybe the Chalmers folks will tell me when I go there on Friday :-)
10:04:11 <ndm> how come you're going off to chalmers?
10:04:20 <ndm> i had a friend come back from their last week
10:04:55 <dcoutts__> ndm: just because I'm in the country
10:05:03 <dcoutts__> so I asked if I could come visit
10:05:04 <ndm> why are you in the country?
10:05:11 <ndm> just a holiday, or something else?
10:05:28 <dcoutts__> because my gf is here at a research institute for several months
10:05:32 <dcoutts__> I'm just visiting
10:05:43 <ndm> ah, i thought you'd been in sweden recently as well
10:05:46 <ndm> that explains it :)
10:05:51 <dcoutts__> :-)

10:21:33 <glguy> (=<<) ?
10:21:49 <edwardk> ?
10:22:02 <mauke> =<< is the real flip (>>=)
10:23:05 <syntaxfree> I don't understand infixl/infixr declarations.
10:23:17 <edwardk> syntaxfree: whats not to understand?
10:23:42 <syntaxfree> I'd like to have an infix operator such that x !\ f = f x, and it binds stronger than anything.
10:23:46 <xerox_> ?pl flip (>>=)
10:23:46 <lambdabot> (=<<)
10:23:48 <syntaxfree> *Main> double 3!\inc
10:23:48 <syntaxfree> 7
10:23:52 <xerox_> mauke: I don't think so.
10:23:53 <glguy> they determine if 1 @ 1 @ 1 @ 1 is ((1 @ 1) @ 1) @ 1
10:24:04 <syntaxfree> I wish that was 8.
10:24:06 <glguy> or 1@ (1 @ (1 @ 1))
10:24:20 <Cale> syntaxfree: it can't bind stronger than function application
10:24:40 <syntaxfree> not (double 3)!\inc, but double (3!\inc)
10:24:40 <edwardk> syntaxfree: they tell you the way in which something associates left ((a*b)*c) or right (a*(b*c)) and how tightly bound they are. unfortunately the only thing that binds closer than function application is @
10:24:51 <mauke> @type ((>>=), flip ap)
10:24:52 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a b (m1 :: * -> *) a1 b1. (Monad m, Monad m1) => (m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b, m1 a1 -> m1 (a1 -> b1) -> m1 b1)
10:25:01 <xerox_> :)
10:25:32 <mauke> a -> m b and m (a -> b) aren't really different if m is the function monad :-)
10:25:56 <syntaxfree> so, there's really no way to have "double 3!\inc" evaluate to "double (3!\inc)"?
10:26:14 <xerox_> mauke: right, that's a flip difference.
10:26:15 <syntaxfree> (as opposed to "(double 3)!\ in"
10:27:25 <mauke> syntaxfree: right
10:27:41 <mauke> infix only goes up to 9
10:28:06 <mauke> .oO( ghc -fcrank-it-up-to-11 )
10:28:51 <syntaxfree> stronger-than-function application binding would make DSL creation more flexible.
10:29:47 <syntaxfree> I'm experimenting around with how far I can twist and bend Haskell syntax in a DSL.
10:30:21 <syntaxfree> x !\f = f x  reverses verb-object order as to match Ruby style, but not in a very useful way.
10:31:16 <xerox_> Well, you can probably do it with TH?
10:31:49 * syntaxfree 's not sure he has the Haskell chops to do TH.
10:31:52 <dmhouse> What _can't_ you do with TH?
10:31:52 <syntaxfree> But I'll check it out.
10:32:05 <Philippa> don't forget to consider how bad the error messages are for common mistakes
10:32:12 <xerox_> Everything you can't do with TH.
10:32:32 <syntaxfree> ah. Template Haskell = Lisp macros?
10:32:45 <syntaxfree> "Template Haskell is an extension to Haskell 98 that allows you to do type-safe compile-time meta-programming, with Haskell both as the manipulating language and the language being manipulated."
10:35:34 <syntaxfree> People find (&) =  flip (.), in my limited DSL experience.
10:35:52 <syntaxfree> Once they learn about folds I find them doing foldr (&) [action, action, action, action]
10:37:17 <syntaxfree> function composition is counter-intuitive, even for grad students doing mathematics-intensive research.
10:38:19 <jurks> How can i remove  space, \n, \t from string head.. if there are any of them ?
10:38:33 <mauke> dropWhile isSpace
10:39:06 <syntaxfree> dropWhile p = if p tail else id
10:39:10 <syntaxfree> ?
10:39:41 <glguy> dropWhile p (x:xs) = if p x then dropWhile p xs else (x:xs)
10:40:03 <monochrom> Function composition is counter-intuitive.  Yet Unix pipelines are intuitive (or are they?).  I wonder why.  Apart from the difference between left-to-right and right-to-left, I can't think of a reason.
10:40:19 <glguy> and: dropWhile p [] = []
10:40:29 <syntaxfree> I haven't exposed my colleagues to unix pipes.
10:40:30 <xerox_> monochrom: I don't think it is counter-intuitive, hmmm.
10:40:46 <glguy> foldr (.) id makes sense enough to me
10:40:54 <syntaxfree> They just think in terms of "do this, then do that with this result".
10:41:00 <syntaxfree> foldr (.) does the reverse.
10:41:01 <monochrom> I of course think everything is intuitive.  But intuition is very personal.
10:41:55 <svref> how does one make a global variable?
10:42:11 <mauke> there are no variables, only local constants
10:42:19 <MarcWeber> glguy: Thanks I got it. Works great: http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/PAxwNa69.html
10:42:28 <syntaxfree> svref: why would you?
10:42:50 <svref> because I need to give some instructions to OpenGL only once, the first time the window is drawn, and never again.
10:42:57 <glguy> > execState (mapM modify [(+1),(*2),(subtract 1)]) 3
10:42:57 <dmhouse> svref: that's not a precise concept in Haskell. You can do it, but you'd typically do itfor different versions than in other languages.
10:42:59 <lambdabot>  7
10:43:04 <monochrom> OK, I think in terms of "do this, then do this" too.  I write that as "then_do_this . do_this".  So it comes down to LTR vs RTL, just like I have always wondered?  I really don't want to conclude that humans are *that* stupid.
10:43:14 <glguy> MarcWeber: glad to hear!
10:43:20 <xerox_> monochrom: also, (>>>) = flip (.).
10:43:41 <syntaxfree> monochrom: it's pretty simple when you're dealing with two abstract singleton operations "do_this" and "then_do_this".
10:44:03 <MarcWeber> Why does ShowS allows constant-time concatenation of results? (compared to what different method)? Doesn't mean concating strings copying characters in some way thus beeing dependend on the length of the strings?
10:44:09 <svref> look, the function already has IO in its type signature.  Don't make me read/write files to get my global variable!
10:44:13 <kpreid> svref: that's not global, that's local to your display callback
10:44:16 <xerox_> monochrom: in fact ski thinks that it should be called (>.>) for the (->) arrow, so to not introduce arrow types with (>>>) :: (Arrow (~>)) => (a ~> b) -> (b ~> c) -> (a ~> c).
10:44:22 <glguy> > let comp fs = execState (mapM modify fs) in comp [(+2),(*3)] 6
10:44:23 <lambdabot>  24
10:44:25 <syntaxfree> Now remember they've already got research on their heads, and they want a computer to make their lives EASIER.
10:44:49 <svref> kpried: true
10:45:10 <matthew-_> mmm. help?
10:45:11 <matthew-_> Could not find module `System.Plugins.Utils':
10:45:11 <matthew-_>   it is hidden (in package plugins-0.9.10)
10:45:11 <matthew-_>   (imported from ./Database/HaskellDB/DynConnect.hs)
10:45:14 <kpreid> svref: doneYet <- newIORef False; displayCallback $= display doneYet
10:45:31 <jurks> How can i remove  space, \n, \t from string head.. if there are any of them ?.... using FOLDR ? :)
10:45:33 <mauke> MarcWeber: basically, ShowS is a StringBuffer
10:45:34 <syntaxfree> is there some tutorial / paper / memoirs  / field notes on writing a DSL in Haskell somewhere?
10:45:55 <glguy> jurks: that's probably covered in your textbook (c:
10:45:56 <araujo> hello!
10:45:59 <syntaxfree> jurks: heh, all primitive recursive functions are expressible with foldr, but that's  often not intuitive :)
10:46:00 <monochrom> Well the thing is "action3 . action2 . action1" is easier for Arabs.
10:46:13 <mauke> MarcWeber: concatenation is O(1), turning the buffer into a real string is O(n)
10:46:25 <kpreid> jurks: dropWhile
10:46:42 <syntaxfree> if you think of functions as actions, "action3 . action2 . action1" will never be intuitive.
10:46:45 <dmhouse> monochrom: you mean "3noitca . 2noitca . 1noitca" ;)
10:46:46 <mauke> (which is better than using strings for all intermediate results because that requires copying)
10:46:50 <mauke> bbl
10:46:59 <syntaxfree> The reason why we find it intuitive is because we think of (.) as a function between two spaces of functions.
10:47:12 <glguy> function composition is not complicated enough to get excited about
10:47:33 <syntaxfree> Most people just want to express the sequencing of complicated operations.
10:47:53 <satan> hello all
10:48:23 <satan> if i was to write a function that took a number as the base for the log of a number and returned the log function for that base, would it be of the type:
10:48:26 <jurks> id :: [a] -> [a]
10:48:26 <jurks> id = foldr (:) [] [1..10]   <-- Why it gives me  Type[b] ?
10:48:37 <satan> log:: Float -> (FLoat -> FLoat)
10:48:52 <syntaxfree> jurks: your questions look more like textbook  fare than things you'd find in the course of programming.
10:48:56 <syntaxfree> That tends to irk people.
10:49:22 <MarcWeber> matthew-_ Add hsplugins  to your package list
10:49:26 <syntaxfree> They don't wanna solve your homework.
10:49:34 <syntaxfree> Unless you pay'em, of course ;)
10:49:34 <monochrom> No.  I seriously think of "a3 . a2 . a1" as a sequence of actions.  I do not think of (.) as a higher-order function, usually.  I think of it as a punctuation.  It's just another notation for "a1 | a2 | a3".
10:49:39 <jurks> everybody kicks beginners
10:49:51 * syntaxfree teaches private lessons and most of the time he finds himself doing other people's homework.
10:50:02 <syntaxfree> jurks: actually, they're very nice to beginners here.
10:50:14 <syntaxfree> I think I've never met a better group.
10:50:31 <glguy> jurks: you have to ask questions to help yourself solve the problem, not ask for the answe to the problem
10:50:42 <glguy> if you want to see the real support system
10:50:48 <syntaxfree> monochrom: that makes no sense. you're reversing time!
10:51:00 <syntaxfree> @google esr how to ask smart questions
10:51:03 <lambdabot> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
10:51:03 <lambdabot> Title: How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
10:51:26 <monochrom> Try telling Arabs they're reversing time.
10:51:53 <glguy> who are these collegues that doesn't get function composition?
10:51:57 <MarcWeber> mauke Using a StringBuffer (as used in Java) means you allocate n bytes and then writing into that buffer until its full, allocate/rellocate (copy takes place here) and go on... and usingg ++ would requery copying every time, right?
10:51:58 <syntaxfree> monochrom: arabs type "action1 . action2"  and what shows up on their screen is "2noitca . 1noitca"
10:52:07 <glguy> f o g x = f (g x) is not a new idea
10:52:09 <syntaxfree> they still typed "action1" before "action2".
10:52:19 <syntaxfree> Their visual representation goes right to left, but they're going forward!
10:52:23 <svref> what's the necessary Package.Dotting. to call newIORef ?
10:52:36 <kpreid> Data.IORef
10:52:39 <kpreid> @index newIORef
10:52:39 <lambdabot> Data.IORef
10:52:54 <syntaxfree> glguy: they're graduate students, and they're in mathematics-intensive research.
10:53:04 <svref> Variable not in scope: `Data.IORef.newIORef'
10:53:07 <glguy> syntaxfree: so then function composition should be old hat
10:53:15 <syntaxfree> glguy: they've also seen function composition at some point, but dislike twisting their heads around to do it.
10:53:39 <glguy> mathematics-intensive research people that don't like to twist their heads aroudn new problems?
10:53:48 <syntaxfree> see, foldr (.) [the_last_step, intermediate_step, first_step]  id is annoying.
10:54:07 <syntaxfree> they just want to focus on their research, not learning a new language.
10:54:20 <glguy> syntaxfree: execState (mapM modify [first_step, middle_step, last_step])
10:54:25 <monochrom> OK.  So I'm saying, when you teach "a3 . a2 . a1", you don't have to talk about higher-order functions yet.  You can just teach that it's the LTR notation for a1 then a2 then a3.  Moreover with modern IDEs the order of entering stuff is liberal.
10:54:26 <glguy> :-D
10:54:31 <defcon8> If
10:54:31 <defcon8> you call this function twice, and the user types something the first time and something
10:54:31 <defcon8> else the second time, then you no longer have a function, since it would return two
10:54:31 <defcon8> different values <-- what does that mean?
10:54:46 <glguy> defcon8: you are defining an action
10:54:54 <defcon8> pardon me?
10:54:59 <glguy> defcon8: it doesn't return a value, it returns an action that returns a value
10:55:14 <glguy> getLine is of the type IO String
10:55:18 <glguy> it's an action that returns a string
10:55:24 <glguy> it doesn't actually return a string itself
10:55:37 <defcon8> then it is a compound function?
10:55:39 <glguy> getLine always returns the same action
10:56:10 <defcon8> what is the name <- getLine about?
10:56:15 <araujo> defcon8, It is a function returning a value inside the IO monad.
10:56:19 <syntaxfree> monochrom: imagine it's a list with 150 functions.
10:56:21 <defcon8> why can't it be name = getLine ?
10:56:33 <syntaxfree> Everyone can reverse up to about seven elements in their head while whstling.
10:56:52 <araujo> defcon8, that's kind of a long history :-)
10:56:58 <syntaxfree> defcon8: look at the types.
10:56:58 <monochrom> Don't use head.  Use editor.
10:57:10 <syntaxfree> @type getLine
10:57:11 <lambdabot> IO String
10:57:11 * defcon8 is confused :(
10:57:22 <defcon8> is it changing the type?
10:57:23 <syntaxfree> defcon8: I have some advice most people here would disagree with.
10:57:31 <defcon8> does -> change the type?
10:57:34 <araujo> defcon8, But, think of '<-' as an operator to take monadic values.
10:57:35 <syntaxfree> defcon8: Don't use do  notation.
10:57:44 <syntaxfree> here.
10:57:48 <syntaxfree> getLine is "IO String".
10:57:53 <glguy> defcon8: when you run: name <- getLine, you are actually running the action that gets a line and assigning it's value to name
10:57:54 <dmhouse> syntaxfree: I'd disagree with that. :)
10:57:58 <syntaxfree> You want name to be "String" to do something with it.
10:58:04 <defcon8> ahh, okay
10:58:05 <araujo> Yes, for learning is better to use the monadic operators first.
10:58:09 <syntaxfree> @type (>>=)
10:58:11 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) b a. (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
10:58:13 <sylvan> defcon8, name = getLine would bind "name" to "an action that reads a line", not the actual line itself. Think of an action as a "recipe". name = getLine, assigns the *recipe* to name, whereas name <- getLine binds the *result of performing* the recipe to name
10:58:33 <dmhouse> syntaxfree: I see the benefits, but asking newbies to use >>= and >> just to write basic IO code is ridiculous.
10:58:42 <glguy> dylan: do you know C or C# or C++?
10:58:42 <defcon8> okay
10:58:58 <araujo> dmhouse, it's by far better for learning purposes.
10:59:00 <araujo> imho.
10:59:07 <defcon8> so is x = square 2 different to x <- square 2 ?
10:59:14 <glguy> yes
10:59:15 <araujo> Yes.
10:59:15 <syntaxfree> dmhouse: he's asking what (<-) does.
10:59:23 <sylvan> yes. square 2 returns the result, it's just a function, so you want = there
10:59:29 <glguy> defcon8: do you know C or C# or C++
10:59:30 <syntaxfree> dmhouse: if you just want to hack scripting code, do notation is faster to learn.
10:59:33 <defcon8> glguy, yeah
10:59:37 <sylvan> use <- for *actions* and = for values
10:59:44 <sylvan> (though actions *are* values)
10:59:56 <glguy> getLine is like a function pointer, or a delegate, you actually have to run it
11:00:05 <araujo> defcon8, But don't look at "<-" as a single operator, that will just confuse you more. Learn first about the monadic operators.
11:00:07 <glguy> x = getLine is just copying the delegate
11:00:20 <syntaxfree> defcon8: there are two notations to do stuff like IO.
11:00:25 <defcon8> <- is only for actions?
11:00:40 <araujo> No.
11:00:40 <syntaxfree> defcon8: one is "normal"  Haskell notation using the "bind" (>>=) and "return"  functions.
11:00:59 <syntaxfree> defcon8: the other one is "do notation", which is a form of syntactic sugar that makes things look like imperative code.
11:01:03 <glguy> defcon8: you might want to read: http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/index.html
11:01:04 <lambdabot> Title: All About Monads, http://tinyurl.com/hx34v
11:01:07 <syntaxfree> defcon8: they're still not imperative code though.
11:01:15 <glguy> since you will got lots of different help on the topic here
11:01:21 <defcon8> I think I'll just go along with the tutorial
11:01:24 <glguy> then you coudl ask more specific questions after you've learned the basics
11:01:27 <syntaxfree> well, I've stated my case.
11:01:31 <defcon8> thanks
11:01:34 * syntaxfree do notation considered harmful.
11:01:50 <araujo> mm
11:01:51 <sylvan> IMO the one big hurdle is to think of actions as a value. getLine is just a value, that happens to (in some abstract way) represent the action of reading a line. You use "do" and "<-" to bind multiple actions together into larger actions. So use = to bind values to names, and <- to bind names to the results of performing an action
11:01:54 <glguy> what is 'syntaxfree do notation'?
11:01:56 <araujo> syntaxfree, why?
11:02:35 <dmhouse> syntaxfree: I just think some progress is nice for newbies. By banning do notation you're placing a _huge_ theoretical hurdle in front of the most basic of programs.
11:02:52 <syntaxfree> because (x<-y;)  means different things in different cases.
11:02:53 <dmhouse> IO is every program's raison d'Ãªtre.
11:03:00 * araujo admits he doesn't think in terms of actions but of monads/monadic operators
11:03:13 <syntaxfree> dmhouse: most simple IO gets done easily with bind anyway.
11:03:21 <syntaxfree> getLine >>= print
11:03:28 <araujo> syntaxfree, example?
11:04:02 <sylvan> I agree with dmhouse here. I think the vast majority of newbies prefer to think in terms of "actions" or "imperative subset of Haskell" rather than having to learn about monads and the bind operator etc.
11:04:06 <defcon8> can someone give me an example of getLine returning "different" values?
11:04:31 <araujo> As far as i know, the 'do' notation is nothing more than syntactic sugar for monadic operations.
11:05:12 <syntaxfree> most simple IO is inputFunction >>= print .  someFunctionWithIt
11:05:21 <vegai> sylvan: I'm not sure if I want to stop thinking like that
11:05:31 <defcon8> anyone?
11:05:31 <sylvan> defcon8.. Well.. it doesn't return different values, it's just a single value. It does, however, represent an *action* which, if run, would return different results. So I guess you mean do { s1 <- getLine ; s2 <- getLine ; putStrLn (s1 ++ s2) }
11:05:34 <araujo> defcon8, getLine can return any value, as long as it is of type "String" inside the IO
11:05:40 <defcon8> and also randomRio
11:06:01 <syntaxfree> defcon8: getLine returns whatever goes to the standard input.
11:06:03 <Philippa> defcon8: it's really "returning" that belongs in quotes
11:06:20 <syntaxfree> defcon8: it returns an IO type, though.

11:06:37 <lambdabot> Title: MonadsAsContainers - The Haskell Wiki
11:06:44 <defcon8> well (*) returns something different every time I put something different in
11:06:45 <defcon8> what's new?
11:06:50 <syntaxfree> that's a shorter tutorial that might enlighten you.
11:06:54 <Philippa> getLine's a value, that's what's new
11:07:00 <dmhouse> MonadsAsContainers is very good.
11:07:19 <dmhouse> ?google understanding monads site:wikibooks.org
11:07:20 <syntaxfree> defcon8: the "something different you put in"  isn't in the code with getLine.
11:07:24 <araujo> defcon8, getLine can return different values. I told you.
11:07:25 <lambdabot> http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Haskell_monads
11:07:26 <syntaxfree> defcon8: r ead Monads as Containers.
11:07:32 <Philippa> to put it another way: the "something different being put in" is coming from the world outside
11:07:36 <defcon8> araujo, so can (*)
11:07:39 <syntaxfree> defcon8: it's really short, and you'll probably get it by the third paragraph.
11:07:42 <defcon8> syntaxfree, okay
11:07:43 <araujo> defcon8, As long as they are of type String inside the IO
11:07:45 <sylvan> defcon8, getLine isn't a function, it's just a value representing an action. Furthermore *you* don't have the ability to run it. All you can do is combine it with other actions and then bind it to "main", then the compiler will write a function to actually run your action.
11:07:48 <Philippa> defcon8: now show me parameters to getLine
11:08:17 <syntaxfree> Understanding Monads is too long.
11:08:19 <dmhouse> MonadsAsContainers, then http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads then http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/index.html is what I recommend.
11:08:21 <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/ewuzt
11:08:34 <syntaxfree> Monads as Containers puts all the monads needed for IO in a few paragraphs.
11:08:55 <araujo> defcon8, (*) is a pure function. getLine is a function with side effects which wrap its values inside the IO monad, as a way to isolate impure computation
11:09:37 <sylvan> arujo, no getLine isn't a function at all. It's a value of type IO String.
11:09:45 <sylvan> which *represents* an action
11:09:53 <Philippa> sylvan: we've done this argument (in slightly different form) already tonight :-)
11:10:02 <sylvan> ah :-)
11:10:03 <araujo> defcon8, Therefore, every function using getLine also _needs_ to use the IO monad in its other computations to keep the isolation possible.
11:10:04 <Philippa> (though I'm inclined to agree with your usage for now - the distinction matters)
11:10:04 <syntaxfree> it's a constant. Constants are functions.
11:10:09 <araujo> defcon8, That's not true for (*)
11:10:14 <Philippa> syntaxfree: no they aren't
11:10:19 <ndm> is haskell.org down? or is it just me again
11:10:24 <dylan> glguy: I've used C once or twice. I quite hate it. Never used C++ or .NET stuff.
11:10:38 <syntaxfree> oh, "constants" are also used for things like "const 3"?
11:10:39 <defcon8> is a whole map expression a monad?
11:10:39 <syntaxfree> nevermind.
11:10:41 <araujo> defcon8, So other way to think about monads is like a way of "isolating" values of specific types.
11:10:50 * ndm signed out of irc to get some work done, signed back in because i need hoogle...
11:10:58 <Philippa> syntaxfree: "const 3" is a 'constant function' - a function that always returns the same result
11:11:02 <syntaxfree> @google hoogle
11:11:04 <Philippa> but a 'constant function' isn't a 'constant'
11:11:04 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/hoogle/
11:11:05 <lambdabot> Title: Hoogle
11:11:14 <syntaxfree> there you are. you don't need this :)
11:11:21 <Philippa> defcon8: the IO type constructor's a monad
11:11:24 <ndm> syntaxfree: haskell.org is down :(
11:11:38 <defcon8> are monads like lambda expressions?
11:11:45 <Philippa> no, they're not
11:11:48 <dmhouse> No.
11:12:05 <Philippa> if you'll accept for now that the IO type constructor (if you like, the type IO a) is the monad, that'll do
11:12:19 <dmhouse> IO is a bit different, so ignore that for a bit.
11:12:23 <Philippa> we talk about code being "in the IO monad" - effectively, "of IO type"
11:12:25 <araujo> defcon8, monads are data/type constructors
11:12:29 <syntaxfree> defcon8: monads are boxes.
11:12:48 <Philippa> dmhouse: I don't think he's asking for the whole explanation for now? Whereas how to do IO seems important at this stage?
11:12:52 <syntaxfree> Now, the problem is, you can't take things out of those boxes!
11:12:54 <defcon8> what is a container?
11:12:55 <defcon8> a list?
11:13:01 <syntaxfree> a box!
11:13:05 <Philippa> lists, maps, anything like that
11:13:09 <araujo> syntaxfree, That depends ....
11:13:23 <dmhouse> Monads, of which Maybe and [] (the list type constructor; [a] is just sugar for [] a) are examples, represent different types of computations. Maybe represents computations that might fail, [] represents computations that return lots of possible results.
11:13:29 <defcon8> ok
11:13:33 <syntaxfree> you can't take things out of those boxes! however, you can apply functions that act to the objects you can touch to inside of the box.
11:13:38 <araujo> If you can take or not values out of a specific monad, that depends upon its implementation.
11:13:46 <Philippa> suggestion: only one of you give an explanation?
11:13:49 <araujo> But you can look at it as a box.
11:13:51 <Philippa> reduces the conceptual noise a bit
11:14:04 * araujo better goes to bed *tired*
11:14:05 <syntaxfree> the conceptual noise is part of the fun.
11:14:22 <Philippa> not when you're a newbie who needs to write working code now, though
11:14:31 <syntaxfree> as much as it makes Haskell seem more confusing, it also shows how passionate people are about it.
11:14:31 <dmhouse> Maybe Int is the type of a computation that might fail, but will return an Int should it succeed.
11:14:36 <syntaxfree> I'm basically a newbie.
11:14:41 <araujo> Explaining monads is always so much fun
11:14:52 <Philippa> I dunno, I think I've grown tired of it by now
11:15:09 <Philippa> but then almost everyone who doesn't do monads-as-containers uses my favourite explanation anyway
11:15:28 <dmhouse> You kinda need both views.
11:15:52 <syntaxfree> You kinda need to view it as an abstract concept. But abstract concepts first get in your head via metaphors.
11:15:58 <dmhouse> Monads as containers gets you thinking "I get how the values and the various monadic functions fit together".
11:16:01 * araujo likes monads-as-containers and sequence-of-computations 
11:16:20 <dmhouse> Then monads as computations gets you thinking "I get why you'd possibly want to use monads, and when I'd need to define my own monads."
11:16:24 <syntaxfree> For example: now you're used to mathematics over the real and complex fields, but once you needed  counting metaphors to grok numbers in first place!
11:16:29 <svref> jeez, its frikcin hard to set a simple state variable in Haskell.
11:16:41 <syntaxfree> svref: yes.
11:16:50 <araujo> who needs that anyway? :-P
11:16:58 <svref> I wasn't expecting the spanish inquisition
11:17:00 <araujo> svref, IORef?
11:17:03 <syntaxfree> svref: I see why'd you need doing GUI code. Most of the time it's unnecessary, though.
11:17:03 <dmhouse> svref: because doing so goes against the grain of how you're meant to write Haskell programs, to some extent.
11:17:36 * araujo thinks you don't need state variables for GUI code
11:17:36 <svref> well, great, but I've been at it an hour, and still no boolean flip-switch.  :P
11:17:51 <svref> http://osaurus.us/~dm/tmp/global.hs
11:17:57 <araujo> argh
11:18:02 <svref> still can't get it to compile
11:18:06 <araujo> global .. the forbidden word
11:18:09 <Philippa> defcon8: when we say "computation", you can think of it as meaning "program"
11:18:13 <Philippa> it's not far off it
11:18:17 * defcon8 's brain explodes
11:18:20 <syntaxfree> svref: There's this deep theory proving that pretty much everything can be programmed in a declarative, referentially transparent way, and once you get rid of algorithmic habits, it's actually a simpler way to map your thoughts to computer programs.
11:18:31 <araujo> svref, global variables are devil :-P
11:18:35 <defcon8> are lists monads or containers?
11:18:36 <syntaxfree> Tubes!
11:18:38 <xerox_> ?type newIORef
11:18:40 <syntaxfree> Monads are a series of tubes!
11:18:40 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `newIORef'
11:18:47 <xerox_> ?type Data.IORef.newIORef
11:18:48 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> IO (GHC.IOBase.IORef a)
11:19:00 <svref> dudes, I've paid my time.  I've been programming functional languages for 10 years.
11:19:07 <glguy> defcon8: Monads can be viewed as containers, or computations
11:19:13 <syntaxfree> svref: pure functional languages?
11:19:25 <svref> But at the start of the day, I want to initialize my drawing canvas one time, and not every fucking time I redraw.
11:19:29 <xerox_> Ah, svref you just need to put |bar <- readIORef| before the last line, and change |foo| to |bar| in the last line.
11:19:30 <dmhouse> defcon8: everyone has their own favourite way of explaining monads. They're hard. They're necessary for understanding Haskell fully.
11:19:32 <defcon8> I BLOODY GET IT
11:19:35 <glguy> defcon8: Monads are better viewed as computations while functors are better viewed as containers
11:20:00 <syntaxfree> defcon8: do you know any cat theory?
11:20:04 <defcon8> no
11:20:08 <syntaxfree> Monads are endofunctors on the category of types.
11:20:09 <glguy> me neither
11:20:11 <syntaxfree> Or so I've been told.
11:20:12 <defcon8> not old enough to do cs yet :D
11:20:17 <Philippa> good
11:20:19 <Philippa> don't worry about it then
11:20:24 * glguy thinks that syntaxfree just wanted an excuse to say "endofunctor"
11:20:42 * Philippa wonders if syntaxfree wants their end funced
11:20:45 <syntaxfree> Should I do it  Meijer style?
11:20:49 * dmhouse thinks glguy did too.
11:20:51 <syntaxfree> Monads are squggly hairs!

11:21:12 <xerox_> Pfft.
11:21:16 <xerox_> svref: you're welcome!
11:21:20 <Philippa> syntaxfree: all instances of Functor are endofunctors on the category of types, too
11:21:42 <Philippa> you underspecified - monads're also monoid objects in the appropriate endofunctor category
11:21:42 <syntaxfree> I knew some cat theory before Haskell.
11:21:46 <glguy> Philippa: that's just to say that they map from one type to another
11:21:54 <syntaxfree> The endofunctor explanation was the first part of getting it inside my head.
11:22:10 <Philippa> glguy: almost. It's a structure-preserving map
11:22:15 <defcon8> I get how monads work now
11:22:19 <defcon8> why are they such a big deal?
11:22:27 <Philippa> 1) they let you do impure things in a pure language
11:22:28 <glguy> defcon8: probably because you don't get them yet
11:22:35 <dmhouse> defcon8: because we can do IO with them
11:22:53 <Philippa> 2) they let you write programs in a language that isn't quite haskell, and some of those languages that aren't quite haskell are really rather nifty
11:22:55 <dmhouse> Because they're the hardest thing that it's necessary to learn to grok Haskell.
11:23:03 <Philippa> for example, there're parsing monads
11:23:23 <Philippa> if you've not been shown what return and >>= do you don't quite grok them yet, but you'll get it with practice
11:23:28 * glguy wonders if Parsec supports lazy parsing
11:23:37 * araujo >>= toBed :: IO ()
11:23:48 <Philippa> glguy: lazy in respect to what?
11:23:50 <xerox_> We've lost araujo in a ().
11:24:02 <astrolabe> heh
11:24:22 <glguy> Philippa: I want parsec to start returning results before it has finished parsing the file
11:24:24 <Philippa> though I suspect not, as it's essentially a state monad with niftiness on top
11:24:30 <glguy> Philippa: so that I don't have to have the whole file in state
11:24:36 <glguy> in memory
11:24:44 <Philippa> in fact, it can't do: it doesn't know if it's met an error or not until it's finished
11:24:49 <glguy> ok
11:24:54 <glguy> that's what I worried about
11:24:56 <Philippa> however, you don't necessarily need the whole file in memory
11:25:25 <Philippa> if your top-level parser looks like many foo, it only needs the current foo in memory
11:25:40 <Philippa> and only as much of that as it can't commit to and has already looked at
11:25:49 <Philippa> you *can* write LL(1) parsers that only need one char in it
11:26:05 <Philippa> making it easy to do that's what all the try stuff's about
11:26:23 <glguy> Philippa: I was just hoping to parse a string from getContents
11:26:27 <Philippa> defcon8: you doing okay there? Got more questions?
11:26:37 <glguy> and do the computation  as i have enough from the file
11:26:39 <glguy> one at a time
11:26:39 <Philippa> glguy: then it'll do what you want so long as the grammar allows
11:26:44 <glguy> ok
11:26:54 <defcon8> Philippa, yeah I need this to sink in
11:26:55 <Philippa> at least, so long as the GC bothers to kick in :-)
11:27:09 <Philippa> defcon8: best way is to largely ignore it and go write some decidedly imperative-looking IO code
11:27:27 <dmhouse> I'll agree with that.
11:27:28 <Philippa> if it'll help, I've got a simple script-like app on my web site that might work for you as an example?
11:28:04 <Philippa> most of the code's in the IO monad - it's designed to generate a .sig by loading a config and pulling a quote from a random .sig file in the current dir
11:28:32 <glguy> ?quote
11:28:32 <lambdabot> spj says: it looks like hopscotch! (referring to a funny notation for lists)

11:51:54 <buggmuzz> its pretty abtract though, dont think youll ever be able to 'learn' it :P
11:52:00 <syntaxfree> defcon8: that site explains how to do factorials.
11:52:00 <buggmuzz> learn about it maybe
11:52:05 <defcon8> glguy, what I meant is, is there a std function
11:52:07 <obseleron> graph theory is extremely important, and it is the point where computer science is forced to show its real math roots
11:52:17 <glguy> defcon8: there isn't a factorial function, no
11:52:22 <defcon8> okay thanks
11:52:33 <monochrom> product [1..10]
11:52:40 <syntaxfree> defcon8: that site has a few definitions of the factorial function. it's entertaining.
11:53:02 <Philippa> obseleron: could've fooled me, I'm too busy with type theory and assorted bits of theoretical CS
11:53:40 <obseleron> Philippa:  yes, but graph theory is something that even the average programmer has to deal with sooner or later
11:53:50 * Maddas blinks
11:53:56 <Maddas> obseleron: In what form?
11:54:03 <obseleron> every form
11:54:11 <glguy> oh, very elightening ;)
11:54:17 <obseleron> try thinking about the tree ADT for example
11:54:18 <Maddas> glguy: beat me to it ;-)
11:54:22 <defcon8> fac 1 = 1
11:54:22 <defcon8> fac x = x * fac (n - 1)
11:54:25 <defcon8> what is wrong with that?
11:54:26 <obseleron> how many types of trees are used in many situations
11:54:30 <monochrom> It is a joy to read.  Gives you the same feeling as Bach's Goldberg Variations.  Starts out with something innocent, then incrementally or abruptly goes crazy, but must come back to something innocent at the end.
11:54:31 <obseleron> trees are graphs
11:54:37 <defcon8> whoops
11:54:38 <Philippa> yeah, but you don't need general graph theory for that
11:54:40 <buggmuzz> defcon:  you have x's and n's around the place
11:54:40 <glguy> defcon8: nothing is wrong with it really
11:54:41 <syntaxfree> defcon8: what's fac 0?
11:54:51 <buggmuzz> also 0! = 1 by definition
11:54:52 <defcon8> why isn't it complaining about n?
11:54:54 <glguy> defcon8: except that n is undefined
11:55:01 <obseleron> in kdevelop, graphs are used within the parser to achieve good highlighting
11:55:10 <defcon8> why didn't it say?
11:55:12 <obseleron> this is an example that pops to mind of course
11:55:15 <monochrom> "fac x = x * fac (n-1)"  x or n, make up your mind
11:55:23 <pejo> obseleron, a bunch of graph algorithms should be sufficient for the average programmer. He/She doesn't need to know any graph theory.
11:55:35 <Maddas> obseleron: There are many examples of things which the 'average programmer' will not meet.
11:55:36 <obseleron> pejo:  i did not say that he /she should

11:55:43 <defcon8> *Main> let fac x = x * fac (x - 1)

11:56:05 <syntaxfree> yes, wtf?
11:56:09 <deadbeef> ftw
11:56:10 <Igloo> Your second line shadows the first one
11:56:13 <Igloo> It doesn't extend it
11:56:14 <obseleron> i only said that it is one of the commonest points that once the average programmer comes close to, cs shows it is math :)
11:56:15 <monochrom> let { fac 0 = 1; fac x = x * fac (x - 1) }
11:56:20 <Igloo> let fac 0 = 1; fac x = x * fac (x - 1)
11:56:23 <Igloo> fac 6
11:56:34 <deadbeef> > let fac 0 = 1; fac x = x * fac (x - 1) in fac 6
11:56:35 <lambdabot>  720
11:56:40 <monochrom> If you write two lines of let, the latter shadows the former.
11:56:47 <Philippa> except often at that point you're just doing "the maths behind the CS"
11:56:48 <defcon8> okay, didn't know
11:56:48 <Maddas> obseleron: You said that the average programmer "has to deal with" it, not that they just come close to it :-)
11:56:57 <syntaxfree> defcon8: again, you HAVE to read the tutorial on writing a factorial function.
11:56:58 <obseleron> Maddas: that is my opinion (stated previous post)
11:57:03 <Philippa> it's not like most theoretical CS that really is, directly, maths
11:57:11 <syntaxfree> defcon8: http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
11:57:11 <obseleron> Maddas: nowadays teh average programmer has to be competitive
11:57:12 <lambdabot> Title: The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer, http://tinyurl.com/3swhu
11:57:18 <obseleron> :P
11:57:25 <Philippa> nowadays the average programmer has to know when to STFU, too
11:57:37 <Philippa> oops, ricochet :-)
11:57:47 <obseleron> lol ok Philippa, i know when i am not desired to speak
11:57:48 <monochrom> Not just nowadays, and not just programmers.
11:57:49 <glguy> nowadays the average programmer is a pretty lousy programmer
11:58:33 <pejo> mono, we're all just lousy? :-)
11:58:41 <obseleron> hey it was not my intention to drive you into a highly selective flame war digitally targeted to my ideas :)
11:58:48 <monochrom> We all need to STFU
11:59:09 <obseleron> well we also must always RTFM and STFU :)
11:59:20 <monochrom> Yes.
11:59:34 <obseleron> i like the . part
12:02:12 * defcon8 wonders how he can buy haskell t-shirts from cafepress with paypal
12:03:21 <syntaxfree> just print your own, it'll be cheaper.
12:03:28 <syntaxfree> unless you actually want to support whoever is printing them.
12:04:02 <Philippa> concatenate TFM and your mouth? :-)
12:04:47 <bartw> yawn
12:07:49 <defcon8> syntaxfree, with the iron on things
12:07:52 <defcon8> it would look tacky
12:08:22 <defcon8> I want to look cool as a geek
12:10:23 <syntaxfree> if your interest in being a geek is looking cool, you're barking up the wrong tree, my friend.
12:10:30 <syntaxfree> ;)
12:11:02 <syntaxfree> Anyway, look at who sells those t-shirts. Maybe it's something worth supporting. Like the haskell.org hosting ;)
12:11:10 <monochrom> Yeah I was wondering if it was just me or if "cool" and "geek" may conflict.
12:11:46 <syntaxfree> you can look cool despite being a geek
12:12:02 <syntaxfree> that often involves understanding how other people "read" the way you look.
12:12:29 <syntaxfree> You can send them the right messages: smart, obsessed with excellence, etc. etc.
12:12:52 <syntaxfree> (GHC has tail call optimization?)
12:12:58 <monochrom> Yes.
12:13:14 <roconnor> GHC has tail calls?
12:13:36 <monochrom> foldl sports a tail call
12:13:47 <Philippa> syntaxfree: I think this manages to be both geeky and cool (at least in the UK where people get the pun) - http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/things/kmt.png
12:14:18 <monochrom> Haha
12:14:30 <syntaxfree> Is sci-fi/fantasy lore considered "geeky"?
12:14:39 <syntaxfree> also,I don't get the brit reference.
12:14:46 <glguy> almost by definition
12:14:57 <syntaxfree> there was this article where they showed the head engineer of the xbox project.
12:15:21 <bartw> that image is genius :)
12:15:41 <syntaxfree> In the first picture he was this disgusting balding guy with a checkboard short-sleeve button-down shirt and a geeky smile.
12:16:20 <syntaxfree> before launching the project, the guy lost 10 pounds, shaved the remaining hair off his head and in the new picture he wore a black turtleneck.
12:16:59 <syntaxfree> basically he went from "loser nerd" to "dark genius".
12:17:00 <bartw> 'black turtleneck'
12:17:13 <bartw> shouts lord-mac to me
12:17:29 <syntaxfree> his black turtleneck had some abstract pattern in dark grey.
12:17:31 <monochrom> The things is the whole thing depends on which community you talk about.  For example for a time (perhaps still true now) the UCB people have long hair and it's their sign of smart and excellence.  But if you look at ancient times when monastries ruled academia (both in Christian Europe and Buddhist China), it was shaved baldness.
12:17:39 <syntaxfree> it looked differently from the steve jobs style.
12:18:48 <syntaxfree> anyway, steve jobs went from looking like an evil rabbi to a cool creative-urban-professional type as well.
12:19:09 <syntaxfree> (Good rabbis always have black hair, the evil rabbis have the evil rabbi blonde haircut)
12:20:02 <bartw> there are good representatives of organised religion ?
12:20:11 <monochrom> Yes, there are.
12:20:28 <syntaxfree> Yes.
12:20:39 <syntaxfree> Actually, most professional representatives of organised religion are quite good.
12:21:02 <syntaxfree> It's just that the evil ones make all the cash and the news.
12:22:01 <monochrom> It's the same question as "there are applications of functional programming?" or "there are reliable programs?"
12:23:16 <monochrom> And it's the same answer too.  Imperative programming and lousy programs written thusly make all the cash and the news.
12:23:28 <bartw> potentially yes, just no evidence :)
12:26:50 <sylvan> Philippa: I don't get that image... Well I get the LOTR reference but not why it's so funny
12:27:22 <Philippa> there's an ad campaign over here about litter that looks similar, only with a bin and someone dropping rubbish in it - "Keep Britain Tidy"
12:27:54 <bartw> we have the same kind of boards in parks for years
12:28:13 <sylvan> Haven't seen that... Even though I'm officially a UK resident nowdays
12:29:12 <Philippa> it's not often you see it directly now
12:29:25 <Philippa> tbh you're more likely to see the anti-BNP variant
12:30:02 <sylvan> BNP?
12:30:21 <SyntaxNinja> w00t
12:30:33 <monochrom> British National Petroleum?
12:30:38 <Philippa> Nationalist Party
12:31:00 <monochrom> Sounds very right-wing, "expell all immigrants" kind.
12:31:04 <Philippa> yep
12:31:13 <monochrom> Scary.
12:31:21 <Philippa> so in the right places you'll spot anarchists putting up stickers where it's a swastika going in the bin, and trying to avoid skinheads
12:31:38 <sylvan> expell all immigrants? Doesn't sound too good for me then...
12:31:41 <Philippa> it was a big deal when they got local council seats recently. Don't think they've ever had an MP
12:31:47 <glguy> just make them emmigrants
12:32:36 <Philippa> they had a big internal argument recently when a native briton of pakistani descent stood for an important position within the party
12:32:53 <Philippa> 'twas rather comical to watch them all effectively yelling "We're not that racist!" "Yes we are!" at each other
12:33:03 <monochrom> haha
12:34:00 <bartw> every part has no-seat parties like that, side effct of democracy
12:34:10 <bartw> s/part/country/
12:36:22 <bartw> Philippa : the noargument function thing still boils my brain
12:36:54 <bartw> in a good way
12:36:58 <Philippa> heh
12:37:04 <Philippa> want some further explanation in PM?
12:37:15 <Philippa> (I'd rather not have to argue my case against three other people at the same time)
12:37:24 <monochrom> I want to see it too.  I won't argue.
12:37:34 <bartw> i think i unerstand it, just trying to see what the implications are from an impure context
12:37:57 <Philippa> there aren't really any from an impure context because a value may still be lazily evaluated
12:38:27 <Philippa> in fact, it'd be entirely in accordance with the standard if it were re-evaluated every time it were called. Every bit as much as if the compiler evaluated it at compile-time...
12:38:52 <Philippa> technically, haskell isn't a lazy language - it's a non-strict one
12:39:22 <Philippa> (oh, but the compiler'd have to terminate, so if it decided it was fed up trying to evaluate it after half an hour and just left it to evaluate at run-time that's sensible whereas a compiler that doesn't terminate on that isn't legit)
12:42:49 <bartw> would this still mae sense in an imperative context ?
12:43:14 <Philippa> in an imperative context lazy evaluation tends to be really really confusing
12:43:29 <Philippa> however, if you were to implement it by hand, you'd have something like:
12:43:53 <Philippa> data Thunk a = Value a | Code a;
12:44:01 <bartw> rand() is a no argument function returning int, assigning it to a variable typed int would evaluate it, not assign the function to a variable to be evaluated later, maybe multiple times
12:44:14 <Philippa> where Code a is equivalent of a C function pointer to a function of type a()
12:44:51 <Philippa> every value would correspond to a Thunk. And every time you want to use the value, you'd call force on it first:
12:45:10 <Philippa> force thunk@(Value v) = v
12:45:35 <Philippa> force thunk@(Code c) = { // some C code
12:45:48 <Philippa>   result = *c();
12:46:00 <Philippa>   thunk = Value result;
12:46:03 <Philippa>   return result;
12:46:04 <Philippa> }
12:46:16 <Philippa> OK, so I gave you a bastard mix of C and Haskell there. Can you see what it's doing though?
12:46:39 <Philippa> "if it's a Value, return it - if it's Code, call the pointer for the result, update the thunk to a Value and return the result"
12:47:18 <sylvan> I'm intrigued by this haskell/C offspring, could you please write a compiler for it and send it to my employer?
12:47:25 <bartw> hehe
12:47:35 <monochrom> You have a very enlightened employer.
12:47:35 <Philippa> *snigger*
12:47:39 <norpan> i've often wanted to inline some c code in haskell
12:47:45 <norpan> so please make it happen for me too :)
12:48:06 <bartw> an imperative haskell with c mixed in
12:48:20 <xerox_> Repent! Sinners!
12:48:25 <sylvan> I'll take any amount of Haskell over 100% C at this point. I'm going insane using C all day long. It's like running through a swamp. It's messy, hard work, and takes forever to get anywhere.
12:48:28 <xerox_> @get-shapr!
12:48:28 <lambdabot> shapr!!
12:48:30 <Philippa> sylvan: I had the problem that I needed to work with a tagged union and couldn't be arsed to write out the longhand C representation
12:48:32 <romildo> Hi.
12:48:53 <xerox_> I think we need an exorcist now.
12:48:58 <Philippa> write a preprocessor that rips out chunks of heavily-marked inline C and generated FFI stubs and a .c file for it
12:48:59 <romildo> How would I link a simple program using Parsec, with ghc?
12:49:01 <bartw> still think that in impure languages there is a diffrence between a function as value, and the value the function evaluates to
12:49:11 <Philippa> yes, there is
12:49:14 <Philippa> in Haskell there isn't
12:49:23 <Philippa> or rather: the function as a value is the /function/
12:49:26 <monochrom> I think it's fashionable to use the C syntax without regard to its semantics.  Thus you can define a single-assignment language with C notations, and people will use it even if it's lazy functional.
12:49:36 <Philippa> and there aren't any functions of no parms
12:49:37 <ventonegro> romildo, tried ghc --make?
12:49:57 <Philippa> just values generated by code that's not been evaluated
12:50:15 <Philippa> effectively, lazy evaluation abstracts over evaluation order - you don't get to say "evaluate it now!"
12:50:45 <Philippa> in return for which you know that - at least in terms of whether your program finishes running or not - it'll always get it right
12:50:47 <Lemmih> xerox_: Hiya.
12:50:48 <romildo> ventonegro: that is it. thanks.
12:50:59 <Lemmih> xerox_: Does cabal-server-install work?
12:50:59 <ventonegro> romildo, np
12:51:03 <xerox_> Hey Lemmih!
12:51:07 <xerox_> Lemmih: nope.
12:51:12 <Lemmih> xerox_: /-:
12:51:20 <xerox_> Lemmih: cabal-put is what we've been using instead.
12:51:21 <Lemmih> xerox_: Seen http://hackage.homedns.org/?
12:51:25 <lambdabot> Title: Libraries and Tools for Haskell
12:51:25 <bartw> Philippa : yay :)
12:51:27 <syntaxfree> monochrom: then again, can't Haskell be written like that?
12:51:30 <syntaxfree> module Main where {
12:51:36 <Lemmih> xerox_: Oh. Does cabal-put work?
12:51:40 <syntaxfree> inc x = x+1; dec x = x -1;
12:51:41 <xerox_> Lemmih: cabal-put foo-version.tar.gz adds the package to the hierarchy and updates the index.
12:51:42 <syntaxfree> etc. etc.
12:51:44 <syntaxfree> }
12:51:56 <xerox_> Lemmih: yeah, it's only on monk, and tailored for that system.
12:52:09 <syntaxfree> also, main = print x where {  etc; etc; etc}
12:52:37 * Lemmih would like to add a few more packages.
12:52:42 <monochrom> Loops need syntactic sugar.
12:52:47 <xerox_> Lemmih++ neat!!
12:52:55 <xerox_> Please add more packages :)
12:53:06 <xerox_> Very very nice indeed.
12:53:49 <syntaxfree> monochrom: loops?
12:54:26 <monochrom> the syntax "while (x>0) { blah }"
12:54:34 <SamB> hmm, have they published the source for UMIX?
12:54:35 <Lemmih> xerox_: Can you walk me through it? I need to get the cabal-put perl script, right?
12:54:50 <syntaxfree> monochrom: what's the type of that?
12:55:00 <xerox_> Lemmih: you need to run it on monk, as "cabal-put foo-ver.tar.gz", with that package in the local PWD
12:55:08 <monochrom> It can be given a semantics in Haskell or any single-assignment language.  But people like the syntax.
12:55:09 <xerox_> `in the CWD.'
12:55:28 <glguy> monochrom: can't* ?
12:55:32 <xerox_> Lemmih: if you want to do it remotely, you'd do something with ssh, like scp the package, and run cabal-put via ssh.
12:55:33 <Lemmih> xerox_: Ah, so cabal-put is located on monk?
12:55:39 <xerox_> Right.
12:56:23 <syntaxfree> Closures = currying?
12:56:32 <monochrom> Bah it's hard to explain anything to anything with prejudices.
12:56:50 <xerox_> `to anyone' ? :)
12:56:54 <syntaxfree> monochrom: maybe it's just that I have next to no experience with imperative languages.
12:56:59 <SamB> syntaxfree: partially applied functions are closures, if that is what you mean...
12:57:28 <Philippa> syntaxfree: no. Closures are an implementation artefact of lexical scope and higher-order functions
12:57:29 <syntaxfree> monochrom: The only nonfunctional way of programming I know is GOTO 10.
12:57:40 <Philippa> however, currying'll result in closures being created
12:57:46 <SamB> syntaxfree: s/nonfunctional/dysfunctional/
12:58:04 <SamB> or something like that ;-)
12:58:05 <glguy> monochrom: the while loop could be something like: find (stop condition) (iterate body startvalue)
12:58:09 <Philippa> foo = a b c where a x y = x + y; b = 1; c = 2;
12:58:12 <syntaxfree> Why are closures considered an alternative to oop?
12:58:19 <Philippa> foo will be a closure - it "closes" the values of a, b and c
12:58:45 <SamB> Philippa: I'd say a partially applied function is a closure, since it closes values, no matter how you go about it...
12:58:48 <Philippa> because once you pass foo around, a b and c aren't in scope any more, but their values get carried around
12:59:10 <Philippa> SamB: partially apply a constant function :-)
12:59:21 <Philippa> foo _ _ = 1; <- where's the closure? ;-)
12:59:34 <SamB> well, okay.
12:59:36 <Philippa> bar _ = foo 2 <- how about here?
12:59:53 <SamB> so sometimes the closure can be skipped...
13:00:01 <Philippa> higher order functions are an alternative to OOP because often OOP's used as a way of passing around code in the shape of objects
13:00:25 <SamB> and objects tend to have wierd shapes
13:00:28 <Philippa> C++/Java-style OOP is very much a kludged attempt at higher-order procedural programming...
13:01:01 <kpreid> syntaxfree: also, closures are a possible basis for building objects; here it is not an alternative to OOP, but an alternative to built-in object features
13:01:12 <Philippa> an in an impure, strict language this looks a lot like an object:
13:01:14 <syntaxfree> passing around code in the shape of objects?
13:01:16 <syntaxfree> like in
13:01:27 <glguy> multiple closures can have references to the same value in memory
13:01:30 <SamB> kpreid: ugh no don't remind me about what schemers always do when you mention OO...
13:01:31 <syntaxfree> Data Object = Thing (Thing->b) ?
13:01:48 <Philippa> letrec object = {i = 0; inc = object.i := object.i++;}
13:01:51 <glguy> these different closures can act like the various methods of an object
13:01:53 <Philippa>     in object
13:02:11 <SamB> Philippa: what is that? o'caml?
13:02:15 <Philippa> there, inc is a function value - what people keep calling closures
13:02:25 <Philippa> SamB: it's a bastard mix :-)
13:02:37 <Lemmih> xerox_: Got a tool for packaging tarballs from darcs repositories?
13:02:37 <SamB> I thought that was what o'caml was!
13:02:41 <Philippa> heh
13:02:44 <Philippa> even more bastardised
13:02:45 <SamB> Lemmih: darcs dist?
13:02:50 <Philippa> as I've blurred values and cells
13:02:53 <xerox_> Lemmih: runhaskell Setup.hs dist
13:03:00 <xerox_> Lemmih: err, sdist I think
13:03:09 <SamB> xerox_: thats Cabal, not darcs!
13:03:12 <xerox_> But you ought to rename the file from tgz to tar.gz.
13:03:28 <xerox_> SamB: but the cabal-install packages NEED to be cabalized.
13:03:30 <Philippa> anyway, that's an object - at least, if you don't insist on OO involving messages
13:03:35 <SamB> ... why does the file get named .tgz to start with?
13:03:36 <Philippa> personally, I *like* message-passing OOP
13:03:45 <SamB> mmm
13:03:46 <xerox_> SamB: that needs fixing.
13:03:46 <Lemmih> xerox_: Ah, right. Thanks.
13:03:51 <xerox_> Lemmih: you're welcome.
13:03:57 <SamB> Philippa: hmm
13:04:00 <Philippa> if I'm doing sim work I probably want that level of hackability anyway :-)
13:04:07 <SamB> what is a good example?
13:04:13 <glguy> in C# you could say: NoArgumentDelegate<int>[] makeCounter() { int i = 0; return new NoArgumentDelegate<int>[] { delegate { return i++; }, delegate { return (i = 0); } }; }
13:04:19 * SamB does not think Whisker++ qualifies as a good example
13:04:31 <edwardk> heya, does anyone know of any bidirectional parsing/serializing facilities for haskell other than show/read?
13:04:35 <glguy> and both of those closures would refer to the same variable
13:04:38 <Philippa> glguy: yup. Wasn't my MLish code so much more readable? :-)
13:04:49 <glguy> Philippa: I was too busy typing mine in to read the channel
13:04:51 <xerox_> edwardk: NewBinary does binary IO serialization.
13:05:02 <SamB> edwardk: what did you have in mind, exactly?
13:05:08 <edwardk> xerox: i need to be able to read and write a particular format.
13:05:20 <SamB> there is that B-encoding implementation for Conjure...
13:05:36 <SamB> ... but it only works on simple Python-esque things...
13:05:57 <edwardk> samb: well, i have the bulk of an assembler written for the back end of my compiler. i want to implement a disassembler as a related process and it seems a shame to duplicate the code to marshal and unmarshal data
13:06:05 <SamB> edwardk: ah.
13:06:57 <SamB> edwardk: what does your data look like?
13:07:02 <edwardk> so marshalling stuff from ArithOp Add (Reg EAX) (Imm 8) <-> the corresponding sequence of bytes
13:07:13 <SamB> ah.
13:07:29 <SamB> you could probably just make a table to drive that?
13:07:31 <monochrom> I have always wanted to write a pair of functions that are inverses (or sort of) to each other, and I have always wondered if there is a better way than doing the honestly full amount of work of writing two functions.
13:07:42 <edwardk> I can build it up by hand, but then I have to quickcheck the bejeezus out of it ;)
13:07:50 <edwardk> yeah exactly
13:07:53 <glguy> monochrom: J supports built-in inverses
13:08:21 <glguy> monochrom: check out ^:_1 if you get bored sometime :)
13:08:26 <SamB> but, you have to make your own code to use the table, I think ;-)
13:08:39 <SamB> or tables...
13:09:10 <edwardk> samb: well, most of the translations are fairly formulaic, but there are a lot of rules. so i'm not sure i can readily use a bunch of lookup tables.
13:09:12 <pejo> mono, Glück, Soerensen and some others at Diku have done some research on invertible programs
13:09:22 <SamB> really it would be nice to have a langauge for serialization
13:10:11 <Lemmih> xerox_: '-' should be allowed in package names.
13:10:13 <SamB> (I think usually you'd want to combine things in ways you can't in Haskell)
13:10:30 <Lemmih> xerox_: (cabal-put barks on SDL-image-0.4.0.tar.gz)
13:10:44 <edwardk> I suppose some form of monolithic framework could be built up for Foo <-> Bar invertable mappings and various rules, but not sure.
13:11:00 <edwardk> er not sure how useful it would be to my stated purpose
13:11:05 <SamB> yeah
13:11:24 * SamB thinks some way to write a parser and get a printer (almost) for free would indeed be nice
13:11:44 <xerox_> Lemmih: it does complain about the name?
13:12:26 <SamB> (because the parser has to be more general than the printer)
13:12:30 <Lemmih> xerox_: cabal-put SDL-image-0.4.0.tar.gz  ==>  Invalid format - require PACKAGE-VERSION.tar.gz (foo-1.0.tar.gz) at /usr/local/bin/cabal-put line 13.
13:12:45 <edwardk> http://www.cs.ru.nl/A.vanWeelden/bi-arrows/ sounds about right, mining the paper now
13:12:47 <lambdabot> Title: There and Back Again: Arrows for Invertible Programming
13:13:18 <SamB> ack evil ACM portal!
13:14:08 <edwardk> from that reaction i take it you can't read ACM papers? =)
13:14:23 <xerox_> Lemmih: a second.
13:14:46 <SamB> I do not think I can
13:15:13 <edwardk> one sec. i'll smuggle you a copy
13:15:17 <SamB> I suppose I could try logging in to my school's databases and such...
13:15:32 <SamB> if I could remember the account/password...
13:15:39 <xerox_> Lemmih: may you try now?
13:15:54 <SamB> yeah, I heard the publishers broke the social contract...
13:16:07 <xerox_> Lemmih: no sorry
13:16:10 <xerox_> Lemmih: don't try.
13:16:15 <edwardk> http://slipwave.info/p86-alimarine.pdf
13:16:31 <xerox_> Lemmih: every regexp is tuned for packages that don't have '-' in the name.
13:16:54 <Lemmih> xerox_: regexp, yikes.
13:17:07 <SamB> xerox_: don't you wish you'd used *lex, so they could be fixed together?
13:17:10 <Lemmih> xerox_: You know, a tool written in Haskell wouldn't have this problem (:
13:17:24 <xerox_> Lemmih: yep, I know.
13:17:28 <SamB> Lemmih: because the regexps would be written out as expressions?
13:17:33 <xerox_> Lemmih: if you're up to rewrite it...
13:17:47 <Lemmih> SamB: Because the Cabal library has correct parser functions.
13:17:54 <SamB> that works too ;-)
13:18:01 <xerox_> Lemmih: it started as bash script and evolved to a perl one once it was becoming too awkward.
13:22:22 <Igloo> ...things you never thought you'd hear in #haskell  :-)

13:24:17 <lambdabot> dibblego says: I believe that OO is intrinsically defective and digresses from a formal definition of "software"

13:24:41 <glguy> ?dibblego
13:24:42 <xerox_> Lemmih: it should work now
13:24:42 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
13:24:45 <glguy> hmm
13:24:58 <SamB> glguy: the ones with their own commands are hardcoded in the file
13:25:08 <xerox_> You never do anything off-the-track eh?
13:25:16 <glguy> SamB: I think he might end up deserving one
13:25:22 <glguy> ?photontorpedo
13:25:23 <SamB> suggesting that someone should have a ?theirnick command is like wishing them to be gone
13:25:23 <lambdabot> how does haskell compare to c++?
13:25:42 <Lemmih> xerox_: It worked.
13:25:46 <xerox_> Yay!
13:25:48 <xerox_> perl++
13:25:50 <glguy> ?photontorpedo
13:25:51 <lambdabot> why haskell over smalltalk? I thought smalltalked rocked

13:26:22 <lambdabot> xerox: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
13:26:28 <SamB> you seem to have nuetralized perls karma
13:26:34 * SamB assumes it was -1 before
13:26:39 <Lemmih> perl--
13:26:41 <xerox> Now that is creepy
13:26:42 <Lemmih> @karma perl
13:26:44 <lambdabot> perl has a karma of -1
13:27:09 <xerox> Lemmih: your message was delivered by lambdabot just now O_o
13:27:21 <SamB> xerox: you just fixed your nick
13:27:22 <glguy> You just switched to xerox
13:27:23 <xerox> ``Lemmih said 4h 48m 36s ago''
13:27:28 <xerox> Ah.
13:27:31 <SamB> it doesn't deliver unless you talk ;-)
13:27:34 <Lemmih> xerox: You were hiding under a fake name (:
13:27:41 <SamB> with the nick it was expecting, no less!
13:27:43 <glguy> lurker!
13:27:52 <xerox> Just because I used perl for that script now don't be so angry!
13:28:14 <xerox> %-)
13:28:55 <Lemmih> Yay, there are now 32 packages in unstable/
13:29:06 <dcoutts__> edwardk: you've got an x86 assembler in Haskell? that sounds useful if it's reusable.
13:29:22 <xerox> Lemmih: good :)
13:29:47 <dcoutts__> bringert: you about ?
13:30:05 <bringert> dcoutts__: yep
13:30:07 <edwardk> dcoutts_: its coming along. It doesn't do the entire set of opcodes
13:30:08 <Lemmih> (we need more and better infrastructure for this to hold up)
13:30:18 <xerox> Lemmih: I see `categories' on the web interface, how are they supposed to be inferred?
13:30:19 <dcoutts__> bringert: so I'll be talking this Friday, which is cool. :-)
13:30:34 <bringert> dcoutts__: yeah, nibro told me
13:30:37 <bringert> great
13:30:42 <edwardk> just the stuff I need, and I don't have any form of address patching in place yet. I need to parameterize the types so I can add in ELF style patching to make it compile anything more than the toy example I gave above =)
13:30:42 <dcoutts__> edwardk: still, that could be quite useful if it's the common subset
13:30:48 <xerox> dcoutts__ is a fine talker :D
13:30:49 <bringert> when are you coming here?
13:30:49 <Lemmih> xerox: There's a 'category' field in the cabal package description.
13:30:57 <xerox> Lemmih: perfect.
13:31:01 <dcoutts__> bringert: so I presume there's a whiteboard? is there a projector ?
13:31:03 <Igloo> Lemmih: Better in what way?
13:31:27 <bringert> dcoutts__: I don't know where we will be, but we should be able to get both of those
13:31:33 <dcoutts__> bringert: so I'll be there Thursday, not sure yet if I'll make the 10am start.
13:32:10 <edwardk> dcoutts__: right now i'm actually implementing more of x86 than adam chlipala, and he can use his to disassemble some basic gcc programs, so it can probably be turned into something useful. currently stuck in Arch.X86.Opcodes in my compiler, but i'd be willing to refactor it once it works. =)
13:32:34 <dcoutts__> bringert: I'll be getting the train from Stockholm on Thursday, so I might not make the 10am goings on, but certainly by lunchtime
13:32:39 <edwardk> Its amazing how much work deriving can do for you.
13:32:53 <Lemmih> Igloo: Adding a package is too difficult and we don't provide darcs space.
13:32:58 <bringert> dcoutts__: do you know which train you'll be on?
13:33:02 <Igloo> *nod*
13:33:10 <defcon8> is Num a monad?
13:33:19 <bringert> dcoutts__: my mobile number is +46 704 779794
13:33:20 <Lemmih> defcon8: Nope, it's a typeclass.
13:33:22 <norpan> a class cannot be a monad
13:33:28 <dcoutts__> bringert: not yet, I'm just about to look it up
13:33:35 <defcon8> and what are Ints compared to Nums?
13:33:35 <bringert> dcoutts__: if you need directions or something like that
13:33:43 <bringert> dcoutts__: do you know where to look?
13:33:46 <norpan> Ints are members of the Num typeclass
13:33:50 <dcoutts__> bringert: I'll get a reservation tomorrow so I'll know for sure by tomorrow afternoon
13:33:59 <defcon8> oh
13:33:59 <defcon8> num is an instance
13:34:01 <shapr> edwardk: Have you seen Richard Braakman's uncc?
13:34:06 <dcoutts__> bringert: bahan.se or something isn't it ?
13:34:19 <bringert> dcoutts__: you know that you can buy the ticket online, right? at www.sj.se
13:34:32 <norpan> defcon8: yeah, Int is an instance of the Num typeclass
13:34:36 <edwardk> data Reg32      = EAX | ECX | EDX | EBX | ESP | EBP | ESI | EDI deriving (Ord,Eq,Enum,Ix,Show,Read,Bounded); data ArithOp    = Add | Or | Adc | Sbb | And | Sub | Xor | Cmp deriving (Ord,Eq,Enum,Ix,Show,Read,Bounded);  data Instr = Arith ArithOp GenOp32 GenOp32 | ...  and a handful of functions to parse registers and addressing modes to and from GenOp32s and a bunch of cases for the different isntruction groups
13:34:47 <dcoutts__> bringert: I've got a railcard, I just need an extra suplement for the fast train
13:34:51 <bringert> dcoutts__: bahan.se doesn't exist, banan.se is the swedish banana company
13:34:53 <bringert> ah
13:34:54 <defcon8> square (x :: Int) = x*x   <-- is that haskell98 ?
13:34:57 <dcoutts__> hah ha
13:35:07 <dcoutts__> bringert: ok sj.se :-)
13:35:07 <xerox> @babel it en banana
13:35:09 <lambdabot>  banana
13:35:25 <bringert> I guess you probably can't buy those supplements online
13:35:29 <edwardk> I am currently abusing the order of my terms and Enum to parse most of the internal fields in the opcode
13:35:36 <glguy> defcon8: no
13:35:39 <edwardk> so very little real parsing has to happen
13:36:03 <defcon8> is it sugar for anything?
13:36:09 <shapr> edwardk: If you haven't seen it, check out http://www.scannedinavian.com/~shae/uncc--1.0--patch-4.tar.gz
13:36:12 <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/h8a75
13:36:31 <SamB> what is up with the "pure" or "arr" method, anyway?
13:36:33 <xerox> shapr: what is it?
13:36:37 <SamB> (of the Arrow class)
13:36:39 <shapr> It's an uncompiler.
13:36:47 <shapr> But I thought it might have some useful asm related code.
13:36:50 <SamB> I always thought that was rather disturbing...
13:36:55 <xerox> shapr: what does it uncompile to?
13:36:56 <edwardk> shapr: will do.
13:37:07 <edwardk> samb: its the thing that defines and cripples arrows all at the same time ;)
13:37:14 <shapr> xerox: from a binary to c, but not very well.
13:37:16 <SamB> edwardk: yes, so, why is it there?
13:37:23 <SamB> I think it should be moved to a different class!
13:37:24 <edwardk> samb: lets you turn any pure function into an arrow
13:37:26 <xerox> shapr: arrr, cool.
13:37:36 <dcoutts__> bringert: so you suggested the hacking session, did you have anything particular in mind
13:37:42 <bringert> dcoutts__: I did?
13:38:08 <bringert> I heard ir from nibro :-)
13:38:11 <bringert> it
13:38:17 <edwardk> samb: i'd agree. i have an Arrow' class i used for a couple of test cases that omits it and then lets me reintroduce it in the real Arrow class, but without it you can't construct the Paterson arrow sugar
13:38:26 <bringert> or did I suggest that a while ago?
13:38:30 <dcoutts__> yep
13:38:35 <SamB> edwardk: this is troubling...
13:38:51 <glguy> defcon8: 98: square :: Int -> Int \n square x = x * x
13:39:01 <edwardk> samb: ideally you'd be able to construct arrows parameterized over type classes you want to apply to their heads and tails, unfortunately the current arrow interface and haskell's type system don't really let you do that.
13:39:02 <dcoutts__> bringert: I think I'll present some stuff on fusion for ByteStrings and then some stuff I've been thinking about in the last few days, about mixing imperitive strict & pure lazy coding to do things with lazy bytestrings.
13:39:09 <defcon8> glguy, thanks
13:39:29 <dcoutts__> bringert: and then capturing that pattern using a monad that layers State, Cont & IO
13:39:41 <bringert> dcoutts__: some things of the top of my head: hack alex and happy to produce ByteString code, create a library for shared ByteStrings, for memory efficieny and really fast equality
13:39:53 <SamB> dcoutts: ContT really does what you want?
13:40:02 <bringert> dcoutts__: I think the fusion stuff is really cool
13:40:02 <dcoutts__> SamB: not sure yet
13:40:14 <bringert> dcoutts__: sounds interesting
13:40:15 <monochrom> Eh, what's wrong with arr?
13:40:15 <SamB> ... have you tried using it to make a lazy list?
13:40:19 <SamB> I would start with that...
13:40:35 <dcoutts__> bringert: so hopefully that'll throw up some things people want to discuss and then hack on
13:41:03 <bringert> dcoutts__: I'll try to get some people from the language technology group to go. We need ByteStrings to reduce memory use for things like hugs morphological dictionaries
13:41:17 <bringert> that's where both of the hacking ideas come from
13:41:25 <dcoutts__> bringert: I want to split the time between me jabbering and having some group discussion & hacking
13:41:32 <bringert> sounds good
13:41:34 <edwardk> One thing I really miss is the ability to define Enums with fixed numerical values. its such a pain in the ass to definie something once, then construct your toEnum and fromEnum values for each constructor. you wind up saying everything 3 times
13:43:53 <SamB> I think you are supposed to just define them in order and say "deriving Enum"
13:44:02 <edwardk> hrmm. how many people would scream bloody murder if i completely omitted x87 opcodes in favor of their sse counterparts?
13:44:14 <SamB> and if you didn't want them to be that kind of enumeration, maybe you picked the wrong class...
13:44:17 <SamB> edwardk: eww
13:44:28 <SamB> what is your thing for again?
13:44:31 <dcoutts__> bringert: so I'll probably do a few slides, but mostly keep it informal with the whiteboard. Anyway, that's the plan. Nothing too polished. :-)
13:44:53 <edwardk> samb: that works unless you need a gap or nonstandard numbering or want to start at 4, since for instance TR0-TR3 are not defined in the x86 ;)
13:44:54 <dcoutts__> edwardk: when you mentioned it I was thinking of a ghc native code generator that didn't need an external assembler
13:44:58 <bringert> dcoutts__:  good plan.
13:45:13 <monochrom> sse = ?
13:45:17 <edwardk> dcoutts: yeah i'm writing it for my own internal code generator for much the same reason
13:45:23 <bringert> dcoutts__: there is  a train that leaves stockholm at 06.15, that'll get you here in time for nibro's presentation :-)
13:45:34 <dcoutts__> edwardk: eg for ghci compiling code into memory rather than disk
13:45:41 <bringert> I like the fast Stockholm - Gothenburg trains
13:45:47 <SamB> my CPU is a PII
13:45:49 <edwardk> dcoutts_: I wanted something I could use to generate executable code in external pointers for jitting or to generate code to ELF binaries
13:45:52 <SamB> so it hasn't got SSE
13:45:59 <bringert> takes 3 hours, uninterrupted, as opposed to the plane
13:46:04 <edwardk> samb: ok, so no floating point for you ;)
13:46:07 <SamB> so, I want to know if I care about your software or not
13:46:10 <dcoutts__> bringert: 6:15 eh? hmm, could make that. I'm about 30-45min from T-Centralen
13:46:10 <bringert> there's power and (pay) wifi
13:46:25 <dcoutts__> bringert: yes I took that train on the way here
13:46:25 <monochrom> train has wifi?
13:46:26 <glguy> PII's are outdated like Ada, time to move forward
13:46:42 <dcoutts__> bringert: I don't fly! :-)
13:46:43 <xerox> Wow.
13:46:45 <SamB> PIIs are slow -- ada is ugly. what is the relationship?
13:46:51 <edwardk> samb: well, i'm trying to draw a line as to what optimizations i want to be able to assume are present
13:46:54 <glguy> slow is ugly
13:47:02 <dcoutts__> bringert: I got here on the ferry and train
13:47:06 <bringert> monochrom: yep. it multiplexes several mobile phone network connections, and maybe even a satellite, can't remember
13:47:08 <SamB> slow isn't ugly
13:47:15 <xerox> dcoutts__: why don't you fly?
13:47:15 <bringert> dcoutts__: sweet. you never fly?
13:47:19 <monochrom> amazing roaming there
13:47:30 <glguy> beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it's not really debatable :)
13:47:31 <dcoutts__> bringert: I'm leaving on Monady from Gbg on the ferry to Newcastle
13:47:46 <monochrom> speed is in the eye of whatever
13:47:50 <norpan> hey, are people in gbg, that's where i live!
13:47:52 <dcoutts__> bringert: not never, but I avoid it where possible
13:48:06 <xerox> You might do a SwedishHaskell
13:48:12 <edwardk> and to future proof, in x86-64 native 64 bit mode MMX, x87-fpu and 3dNow! instructions do not have their state saved across context switches, so they become unsafe. I'm more interested in future proofing than in backdating =/
13:48:25 <dmhouse> ?remember xerox dcoutts: why don't you fly?
13:48:32 <bringert> norpan: yeah, I live here too
13:48:33 <xerox> :P
13:48:46 <dmhouse> (It was out of context for me, I didn't realise you were talking about aeroplanes :))
13:48:50 <monochrom> I am not sure that x86-64 exists in the future.
13:48:51 <dcoutts__> because I don't have wings ? :-)
13:48:57 <bringert> norpan: you could show up for dcoutts__'s talk
13:48:58 <xerox> @slap dcoutts__
13:48:59 * lambdabot beats up dcoutts__
13:49:01 <SamB> edwardk: so, what is the code generator for?
13:49:14 <norpan> bringert: i could, but i don't know where or when
13:49:21 <dcoutts__> @slap xerox
13:49:22 * lambdabot slaps xerox
13:49:28 <bringert> dcoutts__: what are you doing over the weekend?
13:49:29 <dmhouse> ?slap lambdabot
13:49:30 * lambdabot smacks lambdabot about with a large trout
13:49:34 <xerox> hehe
13:49:35 <edwardk> samb: for my intermediate language for languages with substructural type systems.
13:49:52 <bringert> norpan: Friday after lunch, in room 6128
13:49:59 <edwardk> samb: and the assembler part in general is so next time i go to write a jit in haskell it'll be fast damnit ;)
13:50:00 <bringert> (at chalmers)
13:50:16 <bringert> by definition, lunch ends at 13.15
13:50:19 <norpan> ah, friday, sorry, i'm supposed to arrange a svensexa
13:50:37 <norpan> yeah, i know, i've studied at chalmers
13:50:58 <monochrom> svensexa = sweden sex festival?  Gosh you Scandinnavians scare me.
13:51:00 * bringert waits for the non-swedish speakers to go "huh?"
13:51:10 <norpan> svensexa is bachelor's party
13:51:11 <bringert> monochrom beat me to it
13:51:13 <edwardk> bringert: i was wondering actually. =)
13:51:38 <norpan> or whatever you call that stuff
13:51:42 <rahikkala> (newbie warning) I'm slowly starting to figure out how to work with the IO monad... but there's something I can't figure out. I have a [IO Int] and I want to print out the the sum of all the ints that you get when you run the actions in that list... how do you do that?
13:51:52 <monochrom> Or am I just being dirty-minded in thinking that "sex" refers to "sex" not "six"?
13:52:01 <bringert> monochrom: neither
13:52:07 <bringert> monochrom: it means party
13:52:13 <glguy> rahikkala: sequence turns an [IO Int] -> IO [Int]
13:52:40 <bringert> monochrom: http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/237/60516.html
13:52:43 <lambdabot> Title: Svenska Akademiens ordbok &#x2013; huvudordet SEXA, http://tinyurl.com/eep2o
13:52:45 <norpan> in this case it is party, the origin is that parties started at 6 o'clock
13:52:47 <bringert> in case you are interested
13:52:53 <edwardk> bringert: as it should it any right minded language ;)
13:52:58 <edwardk> er should in
13:53:05 <glguy> rahikkala: how did you get your [IO Int]?
13:53:08 <pejo> monochrom, sex could be both your options though.
13:53:15 <bringert> the word is actually "sexa", not "sex"
13:53:23 <SamB> rahikkala: you are doing well ;-)
13:53:26 <dwm> Could you also possibly lift sum into the IO monad?
13:53:27 <edwardk> I am noticing a great fixation on time of day here, what gives?
13:53:28 <monochrom> Nice.
13:53:31 <dcoutts__> bringert: no plan yet
13:53:31 <dcoutts__> bringert: my gf will turn up Friday afternoon/evening for the weekend
13:53:43 <dcoutts__> bringert: I'm staying with kolmodin on Thursday night and then a hostel on Friday & Saturday, but no other plans yet
13:53:50 <dcoutts__> bringert: ok, gotta sleep! g'night
13:53:54 <glguy> dwn: you could liftM sum into IO [Int]
13:53:55 <bringert> good night
13:54:06 <glguy> dwn: liftM sum $ sequence xs
13:54:19 <xerox> glguy: liftM sum . sequence, hehe
13:54:27 <rahikkala> glguy: A moment, I'm checking to see if I actually do have it :P
13:55:51 <glguy> rahikkala: I was just asking how you came by a [IO Int] because if you used: replicate 3 readLn, for example, you might want to try: replicateM 3 readLn
13:56:02 <dwm> If you have an [IO Int], the members of that list are actions?
13:56:03 <lisppaste2> rahikkala pasted "[IO Int]" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/26846
13:56:11 <glguy> dwm: correct
13:56:44 <dwm> Even thought the number sitting in there can't really do anything. Because it's in the IO monad, still an action?
13:57:01 <Lemmih> rahikkala: You really want to ask for an infinite number of numbers?
13:57:08 <monochrom> All numbers just sit there doing nothing.
13:57:24 <rahikkala> Lemmih: No, I can just take n from that, or use replicate instead of repeat, right?
13:57:35 <xerox> @remember monochrom All numbers just sit there doing nothing.
13:57:52 <Lemmih> rahikkala: How about 'replicateM'?
13:57:56 <glguy> rahikkala: try: replicateM n queryInt
13:58:08 <xerox> dwm: yep, every value of type IO a is an action.
13:59:39 <glguy> replicate n m is just: sequence (replicate n m)
13:59:44 <glguy> replicateM*
13:59:46 <glguy> is just
14:00:01 <lisppaste2> monochrom annotated #26846 with "an application" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/26846#1
14:00:11 <monochrom> That's for rahikkala
14:00:25 * glguy won't read it then
14:00:35 <SamB> dwm: they aren't numbers...
14:00:37 <rahikkala> Ayup
14:00:40 <SamB> they are actions...
14:00:47 <monochrom> Yeah it's password-protected. :)
14:00:48 * rahikkala will ask more questions once he's taken this in
14:00:50 <SamB> they happen to be all the same action in this case
14:01:01 <xerox> ?type sequence_
14:01:02 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a. (Monad m) => [m a] -> m ()
14:01:08 <xerox> get3 :: IO ()
14:01:11 <monochrom> Oh woops
14:01:46 <lisppaste2> monochrom annotated #26846 with "errata to "applications"" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/26846#2
14:02:34 <dwm> hm ok
14:10:27 <edwardk> so aside from samb is there anyone else here who couldn't run code that only used sse2/3 for floating point?
14:11:31 <int-e> yes, me.
14:11:36 <monochrom> Fictitious statistics shows that most Haskell newbies come here to learn a bit of Haskell, then never show up again.  It seems prudent to conclude that they no longer persue Haskell.  Fictitious statistics also shows that we have a steady stream of newbies.
14:11:36 <sjanssen> glguy: did you try your BLINNET program on any large data sets?
14:11:48 <SamB> int-e: you also have a PII?
14:11:57 <SamB> or perhaps a PIII?
14:11:58 <lisppaste2> rahikkala pasted "whootage" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/26849
14:12:05 <int-e> Athlon XP which afaik does SSE only.
14:12:09 <SamB> oh
14:12:11 <SamB> really?
14:12:15 <monochrom> At this rate, by year 2100 Haskell will still not be popular.  But the upside is that everyone will know a bit of Haskell by then.
14:12:23 <rahikkala> Yeah, that whole program is somewhat on the simple side, but damn, it took a lot of figuring out to get there...
14:12:42 <monochrom> This is much like English.  Almost no one uses it at home.  But everyone knows enough to use it on IRC.
14:12:47 <SamB> hahaha
14:12:56 <norpan> english - don't use it at home
14:13:10 <SamB> monochrom: I thought most people used AOL on AIM
14:13:27 <SamB> or is that just stupid americans?
14:14:15 <monochrom> @hoogle replicateM
14:14:16 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.replicateM :: Monad m => Int -> m a -> m [a]
14:14:17 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.replicateM_ :: Monad m => Int -> m a -> m ()
14:17:07 <int-e> SamB: Intel introduced SSE2 on the P4, and Athlon XP is a bit older than that.
14:18:32 <astrolabe> rahikkal: does it work.  It seems to have one too many 'read's at first glance.
14:18:36 <astrolabe> ?
14:19:07 <monochrom> It is right.
14:19:10 <astrolabe> Ah yes
14:19:12 <astrolabe> I see
14:19:13 <rahikkala> astrolabe: One read is for asking the user how many numbers they want to sum together, the other one for each number to be summed
14:19:22 <astrolabe> thanks
14:19:31 <monochrom> It will bomb if I say "0".
14:20:21 <astrolabe> why will it?
14:20:43 <monochrom> foldr1
14:21:09 <astrolabe> > foldr1 (+) []
14:21:11 <lambdabot>  Exception: Prelude.foldr1: empty list
14:21:23 <astrolabe> oh yeah
14:21:24 <sylvan> rahikkala, you could replace the last line with "print (sum all_nums)", or putStrln (show (sum all_nums))
14:21:37 <sylvan> the point is that sum already exists
14:21:54 <rahikkala> monochrom: foldr (+) 0 all_nums, then, I guess
14:22:18 <monochrom> I am just rambling.  Don't mind me.
14:22:32 <astrolabe> > foldr (+) 0 []
14:22:33 <lambdabot>  0
14:22:37 <rahikkala> Or... yeah, sylvan, I guess  that's a pretty good point, too
14:22:41 <xerox> sum = foldr (+) 0
14:23:45 <astrolabe> haskell is so nice
14:24:12 <sylvan> sum = foldl' (+) 0
14:24:14 <xerox> :)
14:24:31 <xerox> You and your strictness...
14:24:32 <sylvan> since we all care so much about performance..
14:25:26 <astrolabe> what is foldl'?
14:25:38 <astrolabe> @type foldl'
14:25:39 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
14:25:43 <xerox> The strict counterpart of fold
14:25:46 <xerox> ++"l"
14:26:14 <astrolabe> Ah
14:27:04 <sylvan> Yeah, foldl (and fold') is underutilized
14:28:37 <astrolabe> does foldl have an advantage here?
14:29:29 <syntaxfree> What's an open source project that's simple enough I can dive into?
14:29:56 <syntaxfree> I've come to the point there's nothing much I can learn from throwing little 15-line projects.
14:30:11 <syntaxfree> I've also never worked on any larger project.
14:30:25 <syntaxfree> (Of course, I mean something written in Haskell.)
14:31:00 <sjanssen> astrolabe: sum with foldl' is much better than foldr for long lists
14:31:01 <ndm> syntaxfree: Yhc?
14:31:11 <syntaxfree> Yhc sounds complex.
14:31:19 <ndm> syntaxfree: start by trying to compile it, then take a poke around
14:31:29 <astrolabe> sjanssen: I see.
14:31:31 <ndm> syntaxfree: there are lots of little projects that can be done, without doing anything too deep
14:31:35 <syntaxfree> I don't know the first thing about compilers.
14:31:36 <dwm> syntaxfree: darcs is pretty big too, being actively worked on.
14:31:48 <ndm> no need to know about compilers
14:31:56 <sylvan> astrolabe, use foldl (and foldl' which is strict) whenever you completely reduce a list (such as sum, product etc.).
14:32:01 <syntaxfree> Maybe darcs is a better start. It's not in lack of help, though.
14:32:10 <ndm> there is a bug tracker, and in fact, i can think of one bug that would be perfect for a beginner with no compiler experience
14:32:18 <syntaxfree> I see.
14:32:21 <syntaxfree> I'll check yhc out.
14:32:29 <ndm> you might as well try and build it, just for fun
14:32:45 <syntaxfree> yes, I thought I'd try yhc before because of the bytecode thing.
14:33:05 <sjanssen> > foldr (+) 0 [1.. 1000000]
14:33:07 <lambdabot>  Exception: stack overflow
14:33:12 <sjanssen> > foldl' (+) 0 [1.. 1000000]
14:33:14 <lambdabot>  500000500000
14:33:14 <syntaxfree> I use a Mac, and I always find myself running Linux on a Virtual PC window just so I can build cgi projects for my hosted website.
14:33:39 <ndm> syntaxfree: perfect, build it under both!
14:33:47 <ndm> syntaxfree: http://code.google.com/p/yhc/issues/detail?id=37 - thats the bug report i was thinking of
14:33:50 <lambdabot> Title: yhc - Google Code, http://tinyurl.com/qfosz
14:34:14 <ndm> syntaxfree: probably involves a 15 line haskell file, to do the compiling, to start with, and can go as big as you want
14:34:23 <ndm> syntaxfree: and its very isolated from everything else
14:34:48 <syntaxfree> will check out.
14:34:48 <syntaxfree> thanks!
14:34:57 <syntaxfree> I owe so much to the #haskell community, it's not even funny.
14:35:09 <glguy> ha
14:35:52 <ndm> Yhc at the moment is unique in that its big, has lots of isolated components and has lots of easy things to get started on
14:36:14 <ndm> most other haskell project are either smaller, too complex theory wise, or too well maintained to get a start into :)
14:37:14 <Philippa> mmm. Talking of complex, for personal use I think I'm going to largely revert Flippi into being monolithic
14:37:19 <SamB> ndm: it is too bad about that type checker, though...
14:37:33 <chessguy> hmm, anybody know of an existing genetic programming/algorithm framework in haskell?
14:38:16 <ndm> SamB: but that can be ignored, but yes, a nice type checker would be nice (although a more advanced project!)
14:39:01 <SamB> ndm: but it is insane to try to interface it with some kind of dynamic typing thing or anything like that...
14:39:12 <syntaxfree> :)
14:39:22 <syntaxfree> I'll work on that tonight, after work.
14:39:25 <ndm> SamB: Tom will fix that, he's bugged by it now :)
14:39:29 <syntaxfree> (I have some private lessons to teach right now)
14:39:31 <SamB> oh good
14:39:43 <ndm> syntaxfree: cool, if you run into any issues, send an email to yhc -AT- haskell.org (after subscribing)
14:39:52 <SamB> ndm: that was my intention ;-)
14:40:04 <ndm> i have actually been working on a typing method
14:40:08 <ndm> so might try that on Yhc
14:42:24 * SamB looks on mail-archive.com
14:42:27 <SamB> mmm
14:42:35 <SamB> I thought we talked about these issues already...
14:43:07 * araujo back
14:45:31 <SamB> I know all of that stuff already. Which is why I have decided it is unrealistic to try and get support for storing polymorphic values in Data.Dynamic (which is somewhat paradoxical but actually makes perfect sense...)
14:45:48 <SamB> referring to http://www.mail-archive.com/yhc%40haskell.org/msg00304.html

14:46:41 <syntaxfree> *sigh*
14:46:43 <syntaxfree> I'm lost.
14:46:49 <SamB> syntaxfree: hmm?
14:46:57 <syntaxfree> I was reading that Paul Graham essay.
14:47:05 <syntaxfree> "What you wish you'd known in high school".
14:47:09 <SamB> oh?
14:47:10 <syntaxfree> Ever read it?
14:47:22 <SamB> yeah. but I forget what its about, exactly...
14:47:33 <wolverian> how to talk to women?
14:47:52 * SamB was homeschooled. he didn't find it all that relevant.
14:48:08 <syntaxfree> anyway, quote
14:48:11 <syntaxfree> "It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take."
14:48:33 <SamB> hmm
14:48:36 <SamB> doubtful
14:48:54 <syntaxfree> well, yeah.
14:49:05 <syntaxfree> That's what I've been doing since I was about 16, and now I'm completely lost.
14:49:23 <SamB> what have you been doing?
14:49:34 <syntaxfree> working on things that interest me and increasing my options.
14:49:56 <syntaxfree> now I have various degrees of ability in a span of subject, and a degree in something I hate with a passion.
14:50:04 <ndm> what's your degree?
14:50:08 <syntaxfree> (and going to grad school on  the same subject my degree is into)
14:50:09 <syntaxfree> economics.
14:50:28 <ndm> i found i liked one thing, computer science/maths, and specialised really early
14:50:33 <ndm> haven't regreted that
14:50:35 <SamB> that sounds like trying to play a date-sim so that you could win with any of the girls...
14:51:09 <syntaxfree> Well, I had a lot of bad math teachers in high school.
14:51:13 <syntaxfree> So I thought I  hated high school.
14:51:19 <syntaxfree> er, maths.
14:51:31 <syntaxfree> Then I went to <drum roll> film studies.
14:51:44 <SamB> most people who think they hate high school actually *do*
14:51:50 <SamB> ;-)
14:52:00 <ndm> but then go on to forgot, which makes it seem nice once more
14:52:04 <syntaxfree> I eventually dropped out.
14:52:32 <syntaxfree> But I was still afraid of mathematics, so I went to ... economics. I never thought it'd be as mathematics-heavy as it is.
14:52:58 <syntaxfree> Anyway, I found out I loved mathematics, took all the optional math courses, went to summer school in a graduate school in maths and all.
14:53:10 <syntaxfree> Now I'm really obsessed with functional programming theory.
14:53:14 <defcon8> does being an origamist change anything?
14:53:16 <defcon8> I don't get it
14:53:23 <SamB> defcon8: huh?
14:53:32 <SamB> what does origami have to do with anything?
14:53:33 <defcon8> Origamist Haskell programmer
14:53:33 <defcon8> (always starts out with the â€œbasic Bird foldâ€)
14:53:33 <syntaxfree> I'm reading papers by Wadler and Meijer and reading code when I have an important exam this thursday.
14:53:42 <SamB> defcon8: oh. its a joke ;-)
14:53:49 <chessguy> how do i tell whether i have a particular module available?
14:53:53 <SamB> defcon8: its one of the base shapes in origami ;-)
14:53:59 <defcon8> I know
14:54:03 <defcon8> I've been doing it since I'm 4
14:54:34 <syntaxfree> Anyway, I'm freaking lost.
14:54:35 <SamB> anyway, if you don't get it, explaining will not help you to enjoy the joke, will it?
14:54:43 <astrolabe> syntaxfree: sounds like a displacement activity
14:54:44 <syntaxfree> I'm also off to teaching a private lesson.
14:54:53 <syntaxfree> I need the money.
14:54:54 <araujo> > liftM2 (||) ('a' ==) (liftM2 (||) ('b' ==) ('c' ==)) 'd'
14:54:55 <lambdabot>  False
14:54:58 <syntaxfree> what's a displacement  activity?
14:55:02 <araujo> Anybody gets the same result on ghci?
14:55:11 <astrolabe> Something you do to avoid thinking about something else
14:55:22 <SamB> Prelude> liftM2 (||) ('a' ==) (liftM2 (||) ('b' ==) ('c' ==)) 'd'
14:55:22 <SamB> <interactive>:1:0: Not in scope: `liftM2'
14:55:22 <SamB> <interactive>:1:22: Not in scope: `liftM2'
14:55:35 <araujo> SamB, import and try
14:55:38 <syntaxfree> I'm reading freaking Freyd instead of studying.
14:55:41 <syntaxfree> I'm really really lost.
14:55:50 <SamB> araujo: I know, I know...
14:56:10 <araujo> SamB, what you get?
14:56:16 <glguy> araujo: (\x -> any (x==) "abc") 'd'
14:56:34 <glguy> > 'd' `elem` "abc"
14:56:36 <lambdabot>  False
14:56:42 <SamB> hmm, I need to import Control.Monad.Reader as well
14:56:49 <araujo> mmm...
14:57:31 <araujo> SamB, ok, that was it
14:57:39 <araujo> Thanks
14:57:44 <SamB> (it has the Monad ((->) a) instance)
15:00:39 <xerox> Is Haskell' going to have the the Monad ((->) a) instance in the Prelude? :)
15:00:50 <SamB> xerox: you could propose it
15:01:10 <xerox> ``#haskell claims it useful.''
15:01:12 <SamB> clearly, being a Prelude change, it doesn't even need to be implemented more than once...
15:01:41 <xerox> @source Prelude
15:01:41 <lambdabot> http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/base/Prelude.hs
15:02:47 <xerox> SamB: in fact it imports a number of things, it should just do import Control.Monad.Reader :)  I am not sure one can import instances by "name"...
15:02:55 <araujo> xerox, that'd be nice
15:03:22 <SamB> xerox: considering how they lack names, I think not.
15:03:59 <SamB> also your program should work if *all* instances that could be imported have been imported.
15:04:43 <xerox> I fear it will have to wait Haskell''.
15:05:52 <chessguy> ok that's it, i'm buying a haskell book. any recommendations?
15:05:55 <SamB> what I mean is that the fact that only instances in depended-on modules are considered seems like an optimization to me...
15:07:08 <SamB> (you don't actually want the compiler to go digging through all your modules just to see if any might have relevant instances...)
15:08:21 <araujo> chessguy, The Bird one
15:09:41 <chessguy> mmm, i'm looking for something haskell specific
15:10:10 <x3m> are there any way to recieve system info in haskell(like hardware)?
15:10:50 <SamB> you mean like cat /proc/cpuinfo?
15:11:39 <skew> SamB: seems like impredicative polymorphism (at least as in MLF) might help a bit, at least by getting the type farther along
15:12:11 <x3m> samb: something like that yes
15:12:17 <SamB> skew: hmm?
15:12:21 <skew> if you don't erase type applications, anyway :)
15:12:34 <SamB> is this about that Yhc stuff?
15:12:37 <SamB> or something else?
15:12:41 <skew> only vaguely
15:13:41 <SamB> so, what is impredictive polymorphism?
15:13:42 <skew> but if you've got a function at a type like forall a . a -> TypeRep, then a will be instantiated to some monotype at each use if you only have predicative polymorphism
15:13:46 * SamB thinks he needs food...
15:14:03 <araujo> chessguy, that's Haskell specific :-P
15:14:17 <skew> It confuses things a lot if you're compiling through system F and then erasing the types.
15:14:42 <skew> predicative is where a polymorphic function can only be instantated to monotypes
15:14:57 <skew> like, you can't say id :: (forall a. a -> a) -> (forall a . a -> a)
15:16:28 <jurks> how can i add list elements together. ["Mon", "Tue"] ---> ["Mon Tue"]
15:17:26 <skew> looks like unwords
15:17:49 <skew> perhaps you want concat
15:17:55 <kpreid> > (return . unwords) ["Mon", "Tue"]
15:17:56 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Show (m String))
15:18:03 <kpreid> > (return . unwords) ["Mon", "Tue"] :: [String]
15:18:04 <lambdabot>  ["Mon Tue"]
15:18:17 <skew> > concat ["Mon, "Tue"]
15:18:18 <lambdabot>  Improperly terminated string
15:18:22 <skew> > concat ["Mon", "Tue"]
15:18:24 <lambdabot>  "MonTue"
15:18:33 <sek> > foldr (++) ["Mon", "Tue"]
15:18:35 <lambdabot>  <[[[Char]]] -> [[Char]]>
15:18:53 <SamB> skew: at the moment Yhc's typechecker is replacing references to YHC.Internals.typeRep by essentially cutting and pasting part of the known-so-far type of that reference, disregarding all quantification...
15:19:04 <skew> > foldr1 (++) == concat
15:19:05 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Eq ([[a]] -> [a]))
15:19:05 <lambdabot>   In the definition o...
15:19:09 <skew> :(
15:19:17 <SamB> which does not work too well
15:19:23 <shapr> @yow !
15:19:24 <lambdabot> I just got my PRINCE bumper sticker ... But now I can't remember WHO he
15:19:24 <lambdabot> is ...

15:20:03 <lambdabot>  Exception: Prelude.foldr1: empty list
15:20:13 <skew> perhaps you could make a (Typeable a) constraint equivalent to not erasing the type application for that variable?
15:21:05 <SamB> nothing is erased
15:21:21 <skew> oh, then you should be able to get it to work
15:21:42 <skew> if you just make the typeRep primitive a bit special so it gets the type
15:21:42 <SamB> well, I mean, not before this stuff happens...
15:21:57 <SamB> I heard the types go all to hell at some point...
15:22:01 <skew> I'm talking about erasing type applications at runtime.
15:22:07 <zamez> what does   (return . unwords) ["Mon", "Tue"] :: [String]   do?
15:22:11 <skew> which is what I'd really expect
15:22:16 <shapr> Wasn't someone looking for bit syntax for Haskell?
15:22:20 <shapr> edwardk: That was you, right?
15:22:24 <skew> hi shapr, have you looked at my typechecker?
15:22:29 <zamez> I understand what  unwords ["Mon", "Tue"]  does

15:23:26 <zamez> call yourself
15:23:46 <shapr> You think that would really work?
15:23:49 * shapr tries
15:23:52 <zamez> does on some networks
15:24:00 <zamez> if you mean voicemail
15:24:13 <shapr> yes
15:24:19 <shapr> wow, this works!
15:24:21 * shapr hugs zamez 
15:24:23 <zamez> :)
15:24:23 <SamB> heh
15:24:39 <skew> A friend of mine once asked #vorbis why it's dangerous to recharge unrechargable batteries, because he figures they are all pretty smart
15:24:40 <SamB> does it skip the part where the phone rings?
15:25:39 <chessguy> lol
15:25:49 <chessguy> i like this quote from a review of a haskell book: "This really is a well-written and surprisingly accessible book considering the typical Haskell programmer. I can highly recommend it."
15:26:19 <chessguy> so who here's a "typical Haskell programmer" ? :)
15:26:35 * shapr raises Igloo's hand
15:26:40 <shapr> ok, I'm just joking :-)
15:27:00 <abcde`> yes, I program in Typical Haskell.
15:27:09 <shapr> New Extension! w00!
15:27:18 <Cale> chessguy: probably me, having a BMath in pure mathematics :)
15:27:18 <shapr> -fTypicalHaskell ?
15:27:29 <chessguy> touche, Cale
15:28:09 <chessguy> lately i've been wishing i majored in math instead of comp sci. all the cool comp sci stuff i want to do would be a lot easier with a good math background
15:28:21 * shapr agrees
15:28:28 <skew> I got both
15:28:38 * shapr has neither
15:28:39 <skew> but I'm not really much of a mathematician
15:28:56 <shapr> I never finished my art degree.
15:28:56 <skew> mostly concentrated on the things vaguely related to programming, like algebra
15:30:11 <chessguy> hmm, the bird book looks good but hard, and its aim isn't to teach haskell specifically
15:30:16 <chessguy> from what i can tell
15:30:48 <skew> is that important? I don't think there are any hard parts in Haskell that are specific to Haskell
15:31:19 <chessguy> well, i want to learn to program in haskell
15:32:35 <skew> what Bird book?
15:32:45 <chessguy> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521663504/ref=pd_cp_b_title/104-1423720-3100708?ie=UTF8

15:33:38 <skew> okasai? I just got a copy of that. It really is a data structures book, not a general introduction.
15:33:50 <chessguy> oh wait, sorry
15:34:00 <chessguy> i forgot i navigated off that page
15:34:19 <chessguy> sorry, this is the bird book: http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-2nd-Bird/dp/0134843460/sr=8-6/qid=1159309594/ref=pd_bbs_6/104-1423720-3100708?ie=UTF8&s=books

15:35:29 <xerox> G'night.
15:35:34 <chessguy> why is that so funny?
15:35:41 <Patterner> great. amazon.com is broken with konqueror... it redirects to a small ad picture...
15:36:28 <Patterner> well, money saved is money gained.
15:37:43 <ndm> chessguy: root7 :)
15:37:52 <chessguy> maybe i'll just go over to the local borders and see if they have any haskell books on hand
15:38:01 <chessguy> ndm why is that funny?
15:38:18 <ndm> chessguy: root is the name of the main account in Unix
15:38:24 <chessguy> yes...
15:38:33 <ndm> its not massively funny...
15:39:29 <abcde`> When random combinations of letters and numbers make a word, I find it thrilling, ok
15:39:46 <chessguy> lol, ok
15:41:00 <chessguy> i never got why lambdabot copies every link that's pasted anyway
15:43:22 <araujo> chessguy, The Bird book will teach you Haskell.
15:43:53 <chessguy> ok
15:44:11 <shapr> skew: I read most of the Okasaki book last week, it's quite nifty.
15:44:34 <skew> powell's in portland had one on hand, but I haven't read much of it yet
15:44:51 <dibblego> ?type if
15:44:53 <lambdabot> parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
15:44:54 <shapr> Cambridge Uni Press had one on the desk with 20% off, so I bought it.
15:45:12 <araujo> It is that kind of book that doesn't waste time explaining each function in the standard library, but it will teach you the core language.
15:45:22 <araujo> It will also teach you 'think' functionally.
15:45:39 <araujo> Which i think it is more than the half of the battle won for those learning Haskell.
15:45:45 <dibblego> I ordered the Bird book 4 weeks ago from Amazon
15:45:55 <dibblego> and 4 others
15:46:09 <dibblego> 1 arrived (Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists, Benjamin C. Pierce)
15:46:30 <chessguy> the one that teaches math and logic too looks really interesting
15:46:35 <shapr> I want to buy that pierce CT book.
15:47:27 <chessguy> This one:
15:47:27 <chessguy>  The Haskell Road To Logic, Maths And Programming by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck
15:47:27 <chessguy>  
15:47:40 <chessguy> oops, stupid newlines
15:47:44 * araujo wants the book Types and Programming Languages
15:47:55 <dibblego> I bought that one too
15:48:55 <araujo> That should be my next investment too.
15:49:30 <araujo> They are also about to release a new Haskell book for beginning of December
15:49:39 <chessguy> ok, i'm off to borders
15:50:05 <skew> the borders near me does not have pierce's books
15:50:17 <dibblego> araujo, who is "they"?
15:50:41 <araujo> The Cambridge folks
15:50:56 <araujo> http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521692695
15:51:35 <lambdabot> Title: Programming in Haskell - Cambridge University Press, http://tinyurl.com/s5t98
15:51:52 <newsham> the haskell/maths book isnt really a haskell book.
15:51:55 <araujo> The contents and even the name looks pretty similar to "Razonando Haskell" , which is a nice spanish book from the Malaga University
15:52:02 <newsham> its a predicate logic book that occasionally uses haskell
15:52:06 * araujo wonders if he should get it too
15:53:09 <araujo> Though i would like to see something like Practical CL for Haskell
15:53:27 <araujo> That'd be a nice one.
15:57:47 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: can you add a link from the cabal URL to your prototype hackage web interface?
16:01:10 <ndm> Lemmih: are you taking feature requests yet?
16:02:33 <Lemmih> ndm: Sure.
16:02:46 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: The cabal URL?
16:02:48 <ndm> Lemmih: auto-generated haddock docs for all the libraries, would be wonderful :)
16:03:06 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: I mean the hackage DB url..
16:03:07 <ndm> Lemmih: just for the ones for which its easy, using Cabal runhaskell Setup haddock
16:03:33 <Lemmih> ndm: We've been thinking about that. However, there are big security issues.
16:03:54 <ndm> Lemmih: you can dump down a default Setup.lhs, and still get 80% of the advantages, without any security risk
16:03:56 <SyntaxNinja> ndm, Lemmih: I think we want some kind of nightly build infrastructure that generates libs. we should create some kind of chroot / jail infrastructure where we can freely run code, probably w/ ghc 6.6 installed
16:03:57 <Lemmih> It could be done for projects without a Setup script.
16:04:03 <SyntaxNinja> hey, is dcoutts dcoutts_ or dcoutts__ here?
16:04:15 <SyntaxNinja> here's my idea!
16:04:25 <SyntaxNinja> right now, we have "unstable" which has just any package anyone puts there.
16:04:32 <ndm> SyntaxNinja: that would be perfect!
16:04:47 <SyntaxNinja> we start testing packages w/ ghc 6.6, and ay package that works well with it, and with the version of cabal that comes with it, gets added to "testing'
16:05:06 <SyntaxNinja> then we work to make as many packages as possible work in this group. they all should build with each-other, and only one version of each package
16:05:32 <ndm> SyntaxNinja: windows binaries would be really nice to have :)
16:05:39 <SyntaxNinja> so if A-1.1 depends on B-1.1, and C-1.1 depends on B-1.2, then we get A to fix their packages so that A, B, and C can go into "testing", (and they should all work w/ ghc 6.6)
16:05:48 <SyntaxNinja> then we have a big release, "Haskell Packages 6.6"
16:06:00 <ndm> why not make them all depend on Yhc ;)
16:06:08 <SyntaxNinja> I sent an email to dcoutts about this, but he hasn't replied.
16:06:35 <Lemmih> How about writing it down on the wiki?
16:06:36 <SyntaxNinja> ndm: tha'ts a fair question.
16:06:48 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: I want some discussion about it.
16:06:59 <ndm> Sh
16:07:01 <ndm> Sg
16:07:09 <Lemmih> Then how about mailing me as well? (:
16:07:10 <SyntaxNinja> so every night, "unstable" gets built, etc., along w/ the haddock.
16:07:13 <ndm> SyntaxNinja: its not ready for that yet, but we'd like it in future
16:07:25 <ndm> i'd also like haddock --hoogle built, if that was possible, in the future
16:07:29 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: if dcoutts doesn't reply Real Soon Now, then I'll repost to cabal-devel.
16:07:34 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: but I'll foward you the email.
16:07:44 <ndm> dcoutts went to bed a while ago
16:07:50 <ndm> and is in Sweden
16:09:10 <SyntaxNinja> bug me in two days and I'll repost that email to cabal-devel
16:13:34 <Lemmih> We should keep in mind that quite a few packages won't build because of lacking foreign libraries.
16:16:08 * Lemmih recently added 6 "unbuildable" packages to unsafe/
16:16:32 <ndm> woohoo, Hoogle just did a fast text search!
16:16:52 <ndm> (as in not a really really slow one)
16:18:13 <SamB> hmm
16:18:49 <SamB> what would be a sensible way to describe dependencies on foreign libraries?
16:20:23 <Lemmih> I'm not sure there is one.
16:21:11 <tessier>  Intel Pledges 80 Core Processor in 5 Years
16:21:32 <tessier> As soon as I become moderately proficient with zope and python it will be time to open up that Haskell book...
16:21:43 <Lemmih> Haskell will rock those cells.
16:22:03 <SamB> Lemmih: that is not fun :-(
16:22:27 <SamB> we should beat everyone up until they come up with a uniform way to refer to foreign APIs...
16:22:28 <tessier> Indeed. Parallelizing ghc (or something like it) is what will make haskell a much more popular language in the near future
16:22:47 <SamB> tessier: more popular than what?
16:22:58 <Philippa> remind me, are intel doing shared cache for their cores these days?
16:23:00 <tessier> SamB: More popular than now
16:23:13 <SamB> Philippa: hmm, I hope not!
16:23:22 <SamB> covert channels and all!
16:23:24 <Philippa> it'd make a big difference to how fast the obvious pH implementation'd work
16:23:37 <skew> pH was designed for slow networks anyway
16:23:40 <SamB> well, actually, who cares.
16:23:45 <Philippa> SamB: um, I'm missing something, mind if I ask?
16:24:07 <skew> shapr: have you looked at my toy?
16:24:19 <SamB> I really don't care if my programs can communicate with eachother covertly using cache eviction...
16:24:20 <Philippa> IIRC they've got a 'dividable' cache on the Core 2 rather than a fixed allocation
16:24:40 <SamB> (especially not if it is configurable...)
16:24:54 <Philippa> ...because they can do it overtly anyway?
16:25:03 <SamB> yeah, probably.
16:25:09 <shapr> skew: Not yet, got distracted by reality.
16:25:18 <SamB> and anyway: who gives a damn if they can communicate?
16:25:24 <shapr> ndm: Do you use kimbly's inverted index?
16:25:28 <SamB> so long as trusted programs are trustworthy...
16:25:32 <Philippa> someone who wants to hang on to their password
16:25:33 <Philippa> heh
16:25:35 <SamB> (which they aren't)
16:25:36 <Philippa> well quite
16:26:08 <SamB> I guess it might be a big deal on Windows
16:26:10 <Philippa> hrmm, assuming no "I'm done with it now" instruction, how would you use it anyway?
16:26:25 <ndm> shapr: no idea what that is - I use a Trie style data structure
16:26:41 <ndm> with adaptations to allow for searching for substrings as well
16:26:48 <Philippa> actually, for my purposes it doesn't matter if there're two separate caches so long as they both get updated
16:27:14 <shapr> ndm: http://www.kimbly.com/code/invidx/
16:27:16 <skew> I don't think that's so different from separate caches over the same memory, with some kind of cache-coherency protocol running
16:27:22 <lambdabot> Title: Inverted Index Language Shootout
16:27:26 <Philippa> (and the race problems're solved enough)
16:28:04 <skew> in any case, you should be able to trade memory around pretty cheaply
16:28:31 <shapr> I think GC and cache coherency are the same idea expressed in different ways.
16:28:58 <SamB> shapr: huh?
16:29:20 <ndm> shapr: its cool, but that keeps the data in memory, mine doesn't, it pulls it off the disk as required
16:29:30 <skew> the algorithms themselves? I don't see how either could stand in for the other.
16:30:19 <skew> I wonder how an SMP pH could use the fact that only threads evaluating a thunk might update it
16:30:24 <skew> and other than that things don't change
16:31:47 <Philippa> normally you don't get told if you had to block on something, sadly
16:33:26 <skew> It seems like there are a lot of things that might be useful for a pH
16:34:03 <skew> perhaps backing just the reachable data you have cached into a page and passing it out along with a thread
16:49:30 <shizzy0> Hello all, I had a little functional programming epiphany I wanted to share.
16:49:42 <SamB> k!
16:50:37 <shizzy0> I'm writing a program that does some physics simulation, and I wanted to print some info, but not for every time step (just because I didn't want to compute it everytime).  I was thinking at first I might have to cache the info I wanted to print for each redisplay call
16:51:16 <shizzy0> but then I figured I could just keep the result from my print call, the IO() object, around and only update it on the nth time step.
16:51:35 <shizzy0> I haven't tried this out yet.  That'll work, won't it?
16:52:03 <skew> sounds fine
16:52:24 <shizzy0> neat :)
16:52:34 <skew> you might prefer to keep something easier to inspect, like a string
16:53:05 <shizzy0> [nods] good point.
16:53:57 <skew> you're not using IO in the physics simulation?
16:54:00 <dibblego> ?doc Maybe
16:54:01 <lambdabot> Maybe not available
16:54:05 <dibblego> ?doc Data.Maybe
16:54:06 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Maybe.html
16:54:14 <skew> ?doc Certainly
16:54:14 <lambdabot> Certainly not available
16:54:15 <shizzy0> no, just for the display.
16:55:08 <dibblego> ?doc I am
16:55:09 <lambdabot> I am not available
16:55:12 <dibblego> hehe
16:57:26 <skew> shizzy0: what does the simulation return?
16:57:49 <spiffy> I suspect this is extremely obvious to most haskellers here, but Im very new to haskell. The polymorphic functions of haskell are all implemented through type classes?
16:58:26 <dolio> Overloaded functions are implemented through type classes.
16:58:27 <skew> nope, others just have types like [a] -> a
16:58:45 <skew> map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] is "
16:59:01 <skew> is an example of "parametric polymorphism", if you want to make a distinction
16:59:06 <dolio> Polymorphic functions (strictly speaking) are functions that have an unqualified "forall a".
16:59:16 <jz87> yeah
16:59:23 <spiffy> like the example skew gave?
16:59:26 <monochrom> "f x = x"  this gets type "a -> a", no type class.
16:59:28 <dolio> Right.
16:59:29 <jz87> type classes basically takes care of so called ah hoc polymorphism
16:59:37 <shizzy0> is 'forall' a keyword in the haskell language?
16:59:38 <jz87> AKA duck typing in looser languages
16:59:51 <spiffy> ahh that all just became so much clearer
16:59:54 <SamB> shizzy0: no, but pretend that it is
17:00:10 <spiffy> because ive seen the term polymorphic used in both contexts without realizing both are right :)
17:00:10 <SamB> because it is a keyword in the -fglasgow-exts language
17:00:27 <shizzy0> oh! I was wondering about that.
17:00:29 <skew> dolio says overloaded/polymorphic. Other people put it in the adjective, parametric polymorphism/ad-hoc polymorphism
17:00:32 <monochrom> There are too many polymorphisms.
17:00:49 <skew> jz87: I think "duck typing" is more like parametric polymorphism
17:00:53 <dolio> Yeah. There are different terms you can use.
17:00:54 <monochrom> "polymorphic" is polymorphic.
17:00:57 <spiffy> monochrom: i would tend to agree
17:00:58 <shizzy0> haha
17:01:09 <SamB> perhaps it should be made one, regardless of whether it is given a standardized meaning
17:01:09 <spiffy> haha i like that...
17:01:11 <dolio> There's also subtype polymorphism in languages that have such things.
17:01:17 <Philippa> monochrom: no, it's overloaded
17:01:24 <monochrom> Darn
17:01:31 <jz87> no
17:01:36 <skew> at least if you're talking about types like "{any object with a member f of type (Int -> IO)} -> Bool -> IO ()"
17:01:44 <jz87> duck typing is when an object have a method
17:02:13 <SamB> jz87: duck typing is when you do data Duck = Int Int | String String | ...
17:02:14 <jz87> but it doesn't explicitly implement any interface that has this method
17:03:30 <chessguy_away> bah, what a sham
17:03:45 <skew> that's a plain forall like  I wrote above in languages with extensible records
17:03:59 <chessguy> the local borders doesn't have a single haskell book
17:04:06 <skew> or you can do something similar with structural subtyping
17:04:33 <dolio> I don't think I've ever been to a bookstore that had a haskell book.
17:04:49 <jz87> I order from amazon
17:04:53 <jz87> I have an amazon credit card
17:05:04 <jz87> which gives me extra discounts
17:05:18 <chessguy> yeah, it's just unfortunate, because i have a borders gift card
17:05:24 <jz87> oh
17:05:29 <jz87> you can buy chocoloate at borders
17:05:38 <jz87> that reminds me, I got a borders gift card too
17:05:47 <chessguy> lol. nice substitute
17:05:53 <chessguy> chocolate instead of haskell
17:06:03 <jz87> actually I'm waiting for the Sony Reader to come out
17:06:04 <spiffy> cant you use the gift card on the website?
17:06:06 <chessguy>  
17:06:06 <chessguy>  The Haskell Road To Logic, Maths And Programming by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck
17:06:06 <chessguy>  
17:06:08 <chessguy> oops
17:06:09 <jz87> borders said they'll stock them
17:06:23 <jz87> I personally liked The Craft of Haskell programming
17:06:28 <chessguy> spiffy, i don't know, can i?
17:06:28 <jz87> but I hear a new one is coming out
17:07:00 <jz87> oh yeah, the reason why I came here, Is anyone here involved in the hIDE project?
17:07:45 <SamB> chessguy: can't you use your card on amazon.com?
17:07:45 <spiffy> chessguy: yup
17:07:58 <spiffy> you can use borders cards on their website
17:08:09 <SamB> chessguy: ... or ask your bookstore to order one?
17:08:14 <SamB> they do that, yaknow!
17:08:44 <chessguy> oh cool, if i can use my card on amazon, i'll just do that
17:09:20 <spiffy> SamB: kina ;-), they can place an order for you, but a lot of big chains cant actually pick what they want to stock. Dont know if that matters (but it kept me from getting my staff discount on programming books from indigo)
17:09:33 <SamB> spiffy: I'm not talking about stocking
17:09:48 <spiffy> i just found that fact funny when i worked there
17:10:10 <jz87> no one knows anything about the hIDE project?
17:10:12 <SamB> they can order a book and you can pick it up when it comes in...
17:10:30 <SamB> though once I tried that at a barnes and noble and it got on the shelf!
17:10:47 <chessguy> i'm very tempted by this book: http://www.amazon.com/Haskell-Road-Logic-Maths-Programming/dp/0954300696/sr=8-3/qid=1159315709/ref=pd_bbs_3/104-1423720-3100708?ie=UTF8&s=books

17:11:05 <SamB> skew: no
17:11:17 <SamB> it was actually a comicbook
17:11:30 <x3m> are there any way to recieve system info in haskell(like hardware)?
17:11:42 <SamB> x3m: not particularly...
17:11:46 <spiffy> if anyone has read Types and Programming Languages, what would they say is a reasonable price for it?
17:12:03 <spiffy> (while on the topic of books...)
17:12:09 <SamB> what is the price on the back of the book?
17:12:18 <skew> lots!
17:12:29 <SamB> (or is it out of print?)
17:12:29 <spiffy> used from the big chain is 63 CND
17:12:33 <skew> at least if you want to know about type systems and don't already
17:12:38 <spiffy> err, thats new actually
17:13:22 <spiffy> so its good book to add to the collection as an intro text to type systems?
17:13:43 <skew> 63 CND? and a candian doller is a bit under a US dollar?
17:14:04 <spiffy> yup
17:14:17 <skew> sounds like a great price
17:14:41 <spiffy> its about 56 USD
17:15:11 <skew> textbooks are usually a bit more expensive than that around here
17:15:25 <SamB> that is a textbook?
17:15:25 <jz87> that's uh
17:15:32 <jz87> I get it from amazon at 24.61
17:15:37 <skew> well, it's big and it has a lot of information
17:15:45 <spiffy> hmm that does sound better jz87
17:15:48 <skew> and I had a class that used it as a textbook
17:16:25 <jz87> well I get good prices from amazon
17:16:27 <skew> I'm not sure at all what you might be able to get it for, but it's well worth buying
17:16:31 <jz87> yeah
17:16:47 <jz87> hey skew
17:16:58 <spiffy> jz87, still cheaper for me then where i priced it at, except that i have a gift card for the other place...
17:17:00 <jz87> you wouldn't happen to know about the hIDE project would you?
17:17:36 <jz87> I can't seem to find anyone who's working on it
17:17:44 <jz87> and the wiki points to this channel
17:17:45 <skew> SamB: if it were a Haskell book I'd suggest putting little "hey, I didn't realize anybody else used Haskell around here! - <contact info>" notes in them
17:17:55 <skew> jz87: I haven't used it
17:18:38 <jz87> ok
17:18:44 <int-e> @where hide
17:18:45 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HIDE
17:18:46 <x3m2> samb: not particulary.. so there is no way to do it? or do i have to use some c/asm code for it?
17:18:55 <jz87> several people at icfp pointed me to it
17:19:10 <jz87> but I haven't been able to contact the people working on the project
17:19:15 <SamB> x3m: ... how would you do it in C or ASM?
17:19:17 <jz87> I've been going through the source code
17:19:20 <jz87> and the ghc api
17:19:30 <jz87> because I'm interested on building an ide for haskell
17:19:42 <SamB> ... in fact, why would you need to do it in ASM?
17:19:44 <jz87> but since people are already working on one, it might be more efficient to work with them
17:19:54 <SamB> since if you are writing ASM you already know what architecture is in use...
17:20:20 <SamB> jz87: there ought to be people working on it
17:20:26 <x3m2> samb: with asm.. reading cpuid for example and winapi in win, and i could measure cpu speed for example with timers also
17:20:26 <SamB> maybe they are sleeping or something
17:20:39 <SamB> x3m2: mmmm
17:20:42 <x3m2> well i only run x86 so thats enough
17:20:44 <SamB> what do you want that for?
17:20:55 <x3m2> does it matter why i want it?
17:21:05 <SamB> well, maybe I can talk you out of it!
17:21:11 <jz87> ah, that's possible
17:22:29 <x3m> brb have to fix a thing
17:23:23 <SamB> hmm
17:23:44 <SamB> I wonder if there are any haddock docs in Yhc at all?
17:23:45 <Philippa> x3m: if there're C calls available, you can use the FFI and call them
17:23:53 <Philippa> you'd do the same to call the asm
17:24:50 <jz87> well I guess I'll check back then
17:25:21 <x3m> Philippa: well thats c and asm, i asked if it was possible in haskell but i guess not
17:26:27 <skew> x3m is it even possible to do in c (without inline asm)?
17:26:48 <skew> if so you could probably use Ptr stuff in Haskell to do it
17:29:19 <x3m> skew: some of it yes
17:29:29 <x3m> not cpuid maybe
17:31:23 <monochrom> Write the asm code to follow the C calling convention.  Write a .h file to declare the C function prototype.  Use FFI on the C function prototype.
17:31:42 <monochrom> But then again any respectable asm programmer knows the first two already.
17:32:01 <monochrom> I mean, even I, a blatant theorist, know that much.
17:33:06 <int-e> it works that way, too :)
17:40:53 <SamB> monochrom: well, they don't know that the .h will be of any use to Haskell...
17:41:24 <int-e> SamB: the FFI looks at it.
17:41:31 <SamB> int-e: it does does it?
17:41:50 <skew> ghc makes a .c file that includes it, I think
17:41:51 <SamB> depends how you do it, I suppose.
17:41:56 <SamB> if you use a generator, sure...
17:42:06 <SamB> skew: with -fvia-C, yeah...
17:42:17 <skew> I believe the spec says you should include it, and ghc produces a stub C file that includes it in some cases, I think
17:42:26 <SamB> oh?
17:44:55 <int-e> SamB: ok, you get warnings at least with -fvia-C if the .h file is missing
17:45:58 <SamB> int-e: yeah, and maybe it doesn't even work
17:46:50 <monochrom> So you are saying, sometimes we can even omit the .h file?
17:46:55 <int-e> hmm, it probably works as long as no varargs functions are involved (and I don't think FFI handles those)
17:47:17 <SamB> wouldn't vararg functions work better?
17:47:41 <SamB> I think basically the issue is that if there is no prototype the compiler must perform promotion as for pre-ANSI functions...
17:48:43 <int-e> But afaik the ABI prescribes that it does that anyway. At least with Linux.
17:48:54 <int-e> Windows has too many calling conventions.
17:50:12 <SamB> well, I mean in general.
17:50:24 <SamB> I expect windows has no trouble either.
17:53:14 <SamB> hmm
17:53:35 <SamB> Yhc is missing stuff to call haddock in *nix...
17:53:52 <skew> ah, must be the "wrapper" imports and exports that use stubs

18:12:47 <dibblego> how do you point out to the Java zealots that they are just redefining functional programming with a deficient tool that will never cut it?
18:13:00 <skew> smile, nod, and move on?
18:13:09 <skew> or are these people you care about?
18:13:22 <skew> perhaps point them at Scala?
18:13:31 <dibblego> well, not necessarily care about, but their behaviour eventually affects me
18:13:41 <dibblego> and I care about me
18:13:50 <skew> like newsgroup eventually, or boss eventually?
18:13:59 <dibblego> both actually
18:14:08 <dibblego> it seems that ignorance is so bliss
18:14:15 <dibblego> I wish I didn't know
18:14:26 <dibblego> then I could pretend I live in a wonderful and simple world of Java
18:15:23 <dibblego> I read things like "use immutable objects" and "avoid the reference equality comparison operator"
18:15:50 <dibblego> and my colleague yesterday started talking crap that came from Martin Fowler's mouth
18:16:04 <dibblego> apparently what he described was higher-order functions in disguise
18:16:11 <Patterner> you don't like design patterns?
18:16:22 <dibblego> no
18:16:26 <monochrom> You can point out, but it's no use.  They need time to find out for themselves understand.  Give them time and let them do their thing.
18:16:26 <dibblego> I want to stab them in the face right now
18:16:33 <skew> we love them so much we give them names like "fmap"!
18:16:35 <dibblego> but most days I just hate them for misleading this industry
18:17:16 <skew> I've heard rumors somebody in JetBrains is working on an IDE for Scala
18:17:28 <dibblego> apparently a "data clump" is meaningful
18:17:53 <skew> perhaps that might have enought braces in the syntax to get by?
18:17:55 <dibblego> is Scala a moderate step into enlightment? I've only read about it
18:17:56 <SamB> oh, hmm...
18:18:20 <skew> scala is at least as nice as O'Caml, I think
18:18:29 <dibblego> skew, do you give the rumour much credit?
18:18:56 <dibblego> I mean if it's true, I have a very powerful weapon
18:18:58 <skew> well, one of the first demos of their "MPS" thing was an Epigram editor
18:19:00 <araujo> Scala?
18:19:35 <skew> it sounded like it was perhaps a hobby project of somebody working their rather than a flagship product.
18:19:59 <dibblego> poor Backus is 80 years old
18:20:06 <Patterner> I tried scala but couldn't get it to compile...
18:20:07 <dibblego> I feel sorry for the bugger
18:20:21 <dibblego> if I am 80 and we are still talking shit, I'm gunna jump
18:20:33 <skew> Scala at least does pattern matching, higher order functions, and some fancy stuff with open recursion for extensible stuff
18:22:53 <dibblego> I think introducing Haskell to a Java zealot is too big a leap to see why Java is broken - instead, they will conclude that there are two disconnected and unrelated worlds
18:23:34 <int-e> hmm, if it's a true zealot, Haskell will be the broken one.
18:23:40 <dibblego> true
18:25:11 <skew> scala seems to be right in the middle - and runs on the JVM, interoperates with Java, and all that
18:26:21 <dibblego> I might give it a burl
18:27:16 * SamB realizes that
18:27:18 <SamB> erg.
18:27:23 * SamB meant to hit backspace
18:31:23 <SamB> hmm. I need unlit in order to be able to run haddock?
18:32:02 <Patterner> unlit?
18:32:17 <SamB> takes a .lhs file and makes a .hs one...
18:33:31 <Patterner> the gentoo ebuild for haddock has no 'unlit' dependency, so my guess would be "no, you don't need it"...
18:34:03 * SamB should have asked a better question
18:34:21 <dwm> As in: Haddock will only docgen for .hs format files..
18:35:01 <dwm> Does not say anything about it in the man page.
18:36:48 <dwm> Oh, I see something in the haddock manual.
18:37:07 <SamB> what, you can't touch directories?
18:37:10 <dwm> Yeah, must be non-lit
18:37:24 * SamB grumble grumble

18:37:56 <araujo> Other feature request (if it isn't there yet) for Haskell' , : multi-parameter classes by default

18:38:35 <monochrom> alias ghc ghc -fglasgow-exts  :)
18:38:57 <monochrom> Oh darn, you're talking about haskell-prime.

18:39:27 <monochrom> fundep not going in?  what will go in in its place?
18:40:04 <skew> I think they are putting in associated types
18:40:08 <SamB> well, they were looking at associated types...
18:40:19 <monochrom> OK that's awesome.
18:40:21 <SamB> I suppose if they can't get either in they'll have to do it agian...
18:43:43 <SamB> see, this is probably why they are (being?) implemented in GHC...

19:25:44 <araujo> dons, if only i had thought of this before ... on vacation
19:25:53 <dons> the irc client?
19:25:53 <araujo> I could add a simple-clean GUI :-)
19:25:59 <dons> yes :)
19:26:40 * araujo thinks of: read-line+shell+gtk2hs > TODO for around 2 weeks
19:26:51 <araujo> argh, need to finish some exams and projects before
19:27:00 <glguy> shell and gtk don't really relate...
19:27:14 <araujo> This is Haskell .. everything relates.
19:28:18 <int-e> something like wish (tcl+tk shell) should be doable, shouldn't it?
19:28:32 <dons> so do we have someone helping Lyle Kopnicky with this title matching program?
19:28:50 <dons> (do people write to the ruby and python lists saying: my program is slow, help!?)
19:29:07 * araujo wonders when dcoutts__ will release new API though
19:29:16 <araujo> waiting for it to update himerge
19:30:04 <int-e> the idea of matching every title with every other title bugs me ... I so much think it should be done with sorting but that won't work for imprecise match.
19:30:24 <araujo> int-e, i don't like the wish interface at all, though i admit the gui programming there is very easy and portable.
19:30:49 <dons> int-e, have we checked the obvious things: he's compiling, he's using -O, he's using bytestrings for IO ?
19:30:50 <int-e> araujo: I don't like TCL at all.
19:30:59 <ThreeQ> ?pl \a b -> show a == show b
19:30:59 <lambdabot> (. show) . (==) . show
19:31:25 <dons> ?pl \a b -> (show a, show b)
19:31:26 <lambdabot> (. show) . (,) . show
19:31:29 <araujo> (.) sweet for pl
19:31:36 <dons> ?pl \(a,b) -> (show a, show b)
19:31:37 <lambdabot> show *** show
19:31:56 <dons> ?pl \(a,b) -> show a == show b
19:31:56 <lambdabot> uncurry ((. show) . (==) . show)
19:33:46 <int-e> Lemmih asked for test input, and Robert Dockins suggested using Data.Map.intersection. Noone has asked whether he's compiling yet (personally I've just assumed he does)
19:34:03 <int-e> Not on the list at least.
19:34:05 <ThreeQ> ?pl \f -> a f . b f
19:34:06 <lambdabot> liftM2 (.) a b
19:34:11 <x3m> is there a simle way to describe what a monad is?
19:34:26 <ThreeQ> ?pl \f -> a $ b f
19:34:27 <lambdabot> a . b
19:34:35 <ThreeQ> oh, duh
19:36:14 <dons> x3m, hmm. a container for effects?
19:36:26 <dons> x3m, check haskell.org's monad tutorials list
19:36:47 <glguy> bah, Monads are computations, Functors are containers ;)
19:37:03 <x3m> io :: IO a -> Net a
19:37:10 <x3m> io = liftIO
19:37:18 <glguy> liftIO is a bad place to start
19:37:34 <glguy> that gets into Monad Transformers
19:37:35 <dons> yes, that takes an IO action, and lifts (changes its type) to a Net action
19:37:50 <dons> meaning that you can run the IO a code inside the Net monad
19:38:16 <x3m> alright and a Net monad.. is?
19:38:37 <dons> in this case, its a simple global state, containing a socket
19:38:46 <dons> i.e. just a data type threaded through the program
19:39:05 <x3m> okay
19:39:05 <ThreeQ> what do I need to import to get Monad ((->) a) to work?
19:39:11 <dons> so I don't have to pass the 'Handle' argument to all functions
19:39:14 <glguy> Control.Monad.Reader
19:39:18 <ThreeQ> glguy: thanks
19:39:22 <x3m> yeah thats good
19:39:28 <dons> ThreeQ, or Control.Monad.Instances, in ghc 6.6
19:39:38 <x3m> is there anything like classes/structs in haskell?
19:39:51 <dons> structs are: data
19:39:53 <glguy> structs are like data type declarations
19:40:15 <dons> data Struct1 = MyStruct Int Bool (Ptr Word32) ....
19:40:40 <dons> data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
19:40:52 <Cale> But data is more general since it also lets you define sums, not just products.
19:41:10 <dons> how does one do sums in C++?
19:41:18 <dons> its not as hard as in Java , is it?
19:41:19 <Cale> I suppose you could use union
19:41:31 <Cale> though you'd need to work in the tag.
19:41:35 <x3m> what do you mean with sum/product in this case?
19:41:50 <dons> so, data X = X Int Bool
19:42:07 <dons> is a type X, whose values are: X 1 True, X 42 False ... and so on
19:42:22 <dons> its a struct in the C-sense, when you have an X, you always have all the fields of X too
19:42:24 <ThreeQ> hmm, for church numerals, (+) = liftM2 (*)
19:42:28 <ThreeQ> I'm not entirely sure why
19:42:44 <dons> x3m, in programming languages, this is called a product
19:42:57 <dons> (since the type is the "product" of the components: Int * Bool
19:43:11 <ThreeQ> I don't really understand the (->) monad
19:43:18 <Cale> Like a Cartesian product in set theory
19:43:31 <dons> now consider: data Y = A Int | B Bool
19:43:34 <Cale> In set theory, you have A x B = {(a,b) : a in A, b in B}
19:43:40 <int-e> dons: hmmmm. Lyle's code builds many Data.Map from scratch (one for each record examined), that can't be good :(
19:43:40 <dons> its has values: A 7, B True, ....
19:43:50 <dons> ah!
19:44:11 <dons> x3m, so the type Y has vaues that are either an: A Int or a B Bool, never both
19:44:21 <dons> this is a sum type (like a union type)
19:44:34 <dons> and in Haskell you can mix and match your sums and products
19:44:41 <dons> and even have recursive types.
19:44:47 <x3m> alright union then
19:45:00 <glguy> x3m: is that what you wanted to know?
19:45:03 <dons> such as: data List = Empty | Node Int List
19:45:10 <x3m> how can you leave out module Main where in the start of your program?
19:45:17 <dons> ^^ the type List, describing a linked list.
19:45:20 <Cale> But one difference between this and C's union is that here, a tag is stored which tells you which of the branches of the union you have.
19:45:46 <dons> x3m, you can leave it out when you have a 'main' function in the file.
19:46:08 <x3m> oh
19:46:09 <Cale> er
19:46:29 <dons> module Main where is always optoinal these days, I think
19:46:30 <Cale> Isn't the default just module Main?
19:46:45 <dons> yes, if you leave it out, its assumed to be: module Main where
19:47:39 <mercifulhop> very newbie question (because I am): is a ++ okay if it's in the operation of a foldr?
19:47:55 <Cale> > foldr (++) [] [[1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8]]
19:47:55 <dons> doesn't sound terribly efficient. you're writing a concat?
19:47:56 <lambdabot>  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
19:48:10 <dons> (it works,of course :)
19:48:20 <Cale> That's an acceptable way to define concat :)
19:48:29 <dons> It is.
19:48:33 <Cale> > foldr (++) [] (repeat [1,2])
19:48:35 <lambdabot>  [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2...
19:48:58 <mercifulhop> well it's for a project, about manipulating ppm images
19:49:05 <dons> oh, I'd use arrays
19:49:12 <dons> are they large?
19:49:20 <mercifulhop> hmm yes very
19:49:24 <dons> maybe you could just use ByteStrings then?
19:49:39 <mercifulhop> this is a first year university project XD
19:49:44 <mercifulhop> they haven't taught us much
19:49:56 <dons> maybe they assume you can use lists then?
19:50:08 <mercifulhop> well we use lists and data maps
19:50:18 <glguy> dons: teach him ST!
19:50:22 <x3m> import Prelude hiding (catch) this is?
19:50:44 <dons> x3m, it hides the definition of 'catch' in the Prelude, so i can instead use the one in Control.Exception
19:50:52 <dons> ?hoogle catch
19:50:52 <lambdabot> Prelude.catch :: IO a -> (IOError -> IO a) -> IO a
19:50:53 <lambdabot> Control.Exception.catch :: IO a -> (Exception -> IO a) -> IO a
19:50:53 <lambdabot> GHC.ConsoleHandler.Catch :: (ConsoleEvent -> IO ()) -> Handler
19:51:08 <dons> so the 'hiding' is a way to control what defintions in a module are imported
19:51:43 <int-e> is data.hashtable really a win for a nonshared associative map?
19:51:45 <x3m> aha
19:52:11 <x3m> hmm printf.. taken from c?
19:52:12 <dons> int-e, I'm not sure. HsJudy might be though.
19:52:23 <dons> x3m, its simiar yes. sort of
19:52:55 <x3m> whats the difference to putStr.. the formatting?
19:52:57 <dons> > printf "%4d %0.3f" (42::Int) (pi::Double)
19:52:57 <lambdabot>  Add a type signature
19:53:02 <dons> > printf "%4d %0.3f" (42::Int) (pi::Double) :: String
19:53:03 <lambdabot>  "  42 3.142"
19:53:07 <dons> yes, just the formatting
19:53:18 <dons> you're a C++ programmer, you should know this  ;)
19:53:54 <int-e> > printf "%4d %3s" (42::Int) (pi::Double) :: String -- not quite C++
19:53:55 <lambdabot>  Exception: Printf.printf: bad argument
19:54:17 <int-e> (well, C actually)
19:54:48 <int-e> the printf module is quite instructive.
19:55:34 <dons> x3m, you could annotate a paste of the bot.hs code. that would be really useful for preparing the tutorial
19:55:51 <dons> just comments lines with: -- what's printf doing? or -- what's this 'hiding' thing?
20:00:46 <x3m> i'll put "wtf?!" on every second row
20:00:58 <x3m> ;)
20:01:35 <x3m> im rewriting the bot myself now with the stuff that i know, then trying to add so it works
20:13:13 <dons> cool. good idea
20:56:16 <ThreeQ> ?pl \(a, b) -> (a+1, b+1)
20:56:17 <lambdabot> (1 +) *** (1 +)
20:57:08 <glguy> join (***) (+1)
20:58:43 <ptolomy> "***" is weird.
20:59:03 <ThreeQ> ?type (***)
20:59:05 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) c' c b' b. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a b' c' -> a (b, b') (c, c')
20:59:19 <glguy> that only makes it look weird because it works on arrows
20:59:32 <glguy> but since the only arrow we ever really use is (->) it is a lot simpler
21:01:02 <glguy> generally it's just: (b -> c) -> (d -> e) -> (b,d) -> (c,e)
21:01:31 <dolio> ?type join (***) (+1)
21:01:33 <lambdabot> forall b. (Num b) => (b, b) -> (b, b)
21:01:56 <ThreeQ> > join (***) succ (0, 1)
21:01:57 <lambdabot>  (1,2)
21:02:11 <dons> arrows are a great tuple combinator library :)
21:02:16 <dolio> ?type (+1) *** (+1)
21:02:18 <lambdabot> forall b b'. (Num b, Num b') => (b, b') -> (b, b')
21:03:16 <Cale> It feels somewhat irresponsible to be using those functions in the (->) case, but it's so handy.
21:04:18 <glguy> what is a more meaningful Arrow?
21:05:36 <Cale> things like stream processors or parsers :)
21:05:47 <dons> or 3d shoot-em-up games
21:05:56 <dons> the Frag Arrow ;)
21:07:02 <x3m> dons: if i install hs-plugins with mingw would i be able to run it i remove mingw afterwards?
21:07:12 <x3m> if i*
21:07:13 <glguy> how would a Arrow parser relate to a monadic one?
21:08:11 <glguy> or, if a monad is a computation and a functor is a container... what is an arrow
21:10:48 <dons> x3m, i'm not sure. i'm doubtful, but I have _zero_ windows experience
21:11:02 <glguy> I think you might actually be able to
21:11:10 <glguy> while with cygwin you always need the cygwin dll
21:11:16 <glguy> I think that ming works differently..
21:12:07 <x3m> okay

21:31:33 <dons> now. what is it about this language that makes people blame the compiler first?
21:31:43 <dons> and do they do it on the perl/python/ruby/javascript lists??
21:31:50 <Korollary> yes
21:31:52 <Korollary> Ruby
21:31:59 <dons> good :)
21:32:07 <Korollary> But they are right
21:32:09 <glguy> I've heard tell that the ruby interpreter actually is slow
21:32:11 <int-e> glguy: is that a challenge?
21:32:12 <dons> because in the case of Ruby, it really is the implementations fault.
21:32:22 <glguy> int-e: yeah, I don't see how it can be done
21:32:25 <dons> hehe
21:32:40 <int-e> glguy: have you ever seen bogo sort? bogo sort is slow in any language.
21:32:43 <dons> sometimes I think glguy and Korollary should do a show together
21:32:54 <dons> a sort of bitter hacker take on the world. fun!
21:32:59 <Korollary> All others are strict eval anyway, and people DO know how to estimate speed and space behavior.
21:33:11 <glguy> int-e: not in C++ it's not, I've done it, sorted 10 elements in a blink
21:33:13 <int-e> dons: good :)
21:33:37 <Korollary> glguy is not half as bitter as I am. You could market him as Diet Korollary.
21:33:37 <glguy> dons: as long as it's fun, let me know when it's not ;)
21:33:38 <dons> Korollary: ah yes. that could be it. they can't reason about the space or time, so they assume its O(1) ;) and then blame the compiler
21:33:42 <int-e> glguy: anyway, given enough layers of abstraction and C++ is slow. See mozilla.
21:34:06 <dons> Korollary: though I think glguy is getting more bitter with time. or funnier. not sure which
21:34:08 <glguy> int-e: I heard that the root of all c++ evil was too little abstraction!
21:34:13 <sjanssen> hey, glguy, any luck with BLINNET?
21:34:22 <glguy> sjanssen: back burnner
21:34:28 <glguy> )-:
21:34:46 <glguy> sjanssen: I can't read the numbers in fast enough
21:34:53 <int-e> glguy: on the other hand C++ can be blazingly fast and beat C programs of the same length by exploiting templates to generate deeply nested loops inline.
21:34:58 <Korollary> People were surprised when they had way too many objects with dynamic dispatch (such as in some games).
21:35:19 <glguy> int-e: sounds like LISP talk to me
21:35:20 <int-e> glguy: (the example I have in mind had C++ run 2x faster than the corresponding optimized C code :)
21:35:40 <Korollary> Nah, that C qsort vs C++ templatized sort is a known case where C loses.
21:35:56 <glguy> because C++ can inline the comparison function?
21:35:58 <Korollary> yes
21:36:25 <glguy> int-e: my college taught C++ primarily, so I'm all too familiar with it (c:
21:36:37 <int-e> glguy: (I wrote both the C and the C++ version so I think the comparison was fair, and the 2x speedup due to templates providing better abstraction for letting the compiler generate the code I wanted. This is also the origin of me saying that C++ is a usable high level assembler.)

22:00:18 <dons> + hs-plugins + yi. so 1 paper per 100 modules perhaps?

22:41:59 <glguy> yeah, that hits my ear like a slippery fish!
22:42:11 <dolio> Me is correct, since it's the objective pronoun.
22:42:15 <shapr> yup
22:42:15 <glguy> right
22:42:17 <dons> mmm. metaphor-iffic!
22:42:54 <glguy> the guy that sent me that always misuses "I" and "myself"
22:43:05 <shapr> affect and effect make me crazy
22:43:16 <shapr> affect == verb , effect == noun
22:43:18 <dolio> Heh.
22:43:19 <dibblego> your and you're drive me nuts
22:43:36 <shapr> Top posting makes me go postal. Good thing it's email.
22:43:36 <dons> does this .mov play in mplayer for other people ? http://www.shootthevariable.com/loveofdiagrams/nowayout.mov
22:43:38 <glguy> Especially when trying to effect change!
22:43:39 <lambdabot> http://tinyurl.com/o7vuj
22:43:40 <dolio> Well, effect can be a verb, too, but it doesn't mean what everyone uses it for. :)
22:43:41 <glguy> shapr: it's not that simple
22:43:44 <dons> i get a segfault from mplayer around 2 minutes in
22:43:49 <dibblego> effect can be a verb
22:43:52 <shapr> dolio: true
22:44:03 <shapr> But that's a rare case.
22:44:12 <glguy> the grammar-nazis came out in force on that one!
22:44:17 <dons> i love the phrase "to go postal". its really fun.
22:44:31 <dons> must remember to use that more often
22:44:34 <vincenz> I don't get it
22:44:41 <vincenz> where does this derive from?
22:44:52 <glguy> "going postal"?
22:44:59 <vincenz> postal services, or post-some-sort-of-psychological-conditioÂµ
22:45:01 <jcreigh> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal
22:45:03 * vincenz nods
22:45:09 <dons> vincenz: I think its to do with New York (or maybe just US) postal workers having a higher rate of suicide/murder in the workplace
22:45:16 <vincenz> oh right
22:45:24 <vincenz> I could use that for my old college dorm then
22:45:31 <glguy> Postal workers apparently have a problem (in the U.S.) with going on rampages...
22:45:35 <vincenz> we had 2 deaths every year, for 140 rooms
22:45:40 <shapr> scary
22:45:42 <vincenz> typically 1 suicide and 1 accident
22:45:51 <dons> :/
22:45:58 <dons> bad wifi in college dorms?
22:45:58 <vincenz> I remember one year a guy hung himself with an ethernet cord
22:46:01 <vincenz> the cleaning ladies found em
22:46:04 <glguy> There is an episode of Seinfeld where Newman explains why postal-workers go crazy.
22:46:07 <vincenz> dons: this was prewifi
22:46:15 <shapr> Oh, another thing that makes me crazy is sentence fragments.
22:46:18 <vincenz> dons: I did college between 97 and 02
22:46:19 <glguy> vincenz: did he use the good 5e stuff?
22:46:23 <dons> ah, so its not the wifi dropouts sending them postal
22:46:36 <vincenz> shapr: referring to me using the ENTER button as separator?
22:47:00 <glguy> I had a networking teach, and my classmate and I were going ot make sure that we killed her with the cat5e, and not just some old cat 3
22:47:01 <shapr> No, just that in literature there's one specific case where a sentence fragment is accepted usage. I still hate it.
22:47:25 <dibblego> whenever someone uses your instead of you're, I insert a random word in my sentence as well, like hippopotamus or stomach
22:47:38 * vincenz is reading docs on plt's continue webserver, quite interesting :)
22:47:58 <glguy> Theirs no excuse for that.
22:48:03 <vincenz> dibblego: bwahaha, anyways, yes the incorrect usage of your and you're aggrevates me as well
22:48:20 <dibblego> aggravates :)
22:48:27 <vincenz> dibblego: Thanks :)
22:48:31 <vincenz> been a while since I studied english
22:48:52 * vincenz 's only real english experience first hand comes from his highschool period in the US
22:48:57 <scsibug> dons: the whole video plays for me just fine (mplayer on OS X)
22:49:19 <dibblego> it is scary that some people are so simple minded that when I point out that the fact that they are homonyms is coincidental and does not justify the exchange of one with the other
22:49:19 <dons> ok. good. must be my openbsd/mplayer then
22:49:23 <dons> thanks scsibug
22:49:31 <dons> scsibug++
22:49:31 <dibblego> they make up an excuse like "yeah but you knew what I meant"
22:49:45 <glguy> dibblego: and did you?
22:49:46 <vincenz> dibblego: "you new to what I meant"?
22:50:04 <dibblego> glguy, sure I did, I knew they meant to screw up their sentence due to lack of literacy
22:50:10 <glguy> dons: Do you have userldt enabled?
22:50:16 <vincenz> glguy: I typically do, but it's like having sandpaper grating your brain
22:50:23 <glguy> vincenz: Agreed :)
22:50:49 * glguy makes an attempt at being particularly careful in his typing for the next few minutes...
22:51:16 <dons> glguy: hmm? userldt?
22:51:24 <vincenz> I play on a mud that supposedly only allows 18+ (no it's not sexual or anything, just a policy) and the main body of players is native english speaking.  You wouldn't realize how often they get it wrong

22:51:38 <dons> yeah.
22:51:51 <dons> (but I probably should have it on anyway)
22:52:17 <vincenz> shapr: what's the main webserver in haskell again?
22:52:28 <dons> HAppS ?
22:52:36 <shapr> Marlow's HWS?
22:52:52 <vincenz> dons: ah thanks, it's the actual server, or it requires something like apache?  If the prior then it could learn some stuff from continue, cause haskell has support for continuations as well
22:53:11 <dons> glguy: ah! actually that works, I think
22:53:16 <vincenz> (assuming it doesn't already)
22:53:49 <glguy> dons: Also... do you use KDE?
22:53:58 <dons> nope
22:54:02 <dons> dwm :)
22:54:21 <dons> but it is running now, whereas I had to dump it as .avi to get anything before
22:54:22 <vincenz> heh, anyone following progrramming.reddit?
22:54:28 <dons> vincenz: yup
22:54:30 <glguy> Okay, I just remember that KDE eats shared memory, and the ports DESC file suggested that KDE users might need to tweak that knob
22:54:37 <vincenz> dons: the whole debate between linus and tanenbaum?
22:54:45 <glguy> link
22:55:03 <dons> I still get a bunhc of WARNING! Invalid Ptr handle! msgs though
22:55:07 <dons> which doesn't sound good..
22:55:10 <vincenz> dons: It's sad really, whenever you get famous for anything, people start dragging you down.  Why is there always so much flaming.  I have a theory that the amount you get flamed is exponential in the amount you publiciwe
22:55:13 <dons> mplayer is scary and weird
22:55:22 <dons> vincenz: heh
22:55:52 <vincenz> dons: exactly

22:57:03 <shapr> That's one thing I like about my Nokia 770, setup and shutdown time is however long it takes to get it out of or return it to my pocket.
22:57:04 <vincenz> prolly that one
22:57:18 <glguy> I think it's loading now
22:58:05 <glguy> Linus' arguments against the GPL3 have been really weak. I'm not supporting the GPL3, however I would definitely not pick his arguements to defend his position.
22:58:57 <glguy> Just to give myself a little more context for this debate... who the fuck is Andy Tanenbaum?
22:59:37 <ThreeQ> minix guy
22:59:54 <glguy> That's all that he is known for? (I've never heard of MINIX)
23:00:19 <dolio> Writing lots of books on operating system design and such.
23:01:14 <vincenz> glguy: he's a very famous professor in the field of OS design
23:01:22 <glguy> Also, isn't one of the biggest present day hurdles to microkernels the relatively huge delay in switching in and out of kernel mode?
23:01:38 <vincenz> glguy: heh, ast (andy tannenbaum) does have a point
23:01:51 <glguy> I haven't read the debate yet, I was just asking
23:02:04 <vincenz> glguy: people now adays use languages like perl, python, ruby that give you like a factor 2-10 cost, but people complain about 20% gain in kernel time
23:02:08 <dibblego> what side of the debate is Tannenbaum on?
23:02:26 <glguy> dibblego: He favors the microkernel
23:02:32 <glguy> (linux is a monolithic kernel)
23:02:34 <shapr> I think the GPL and the DFSG are two different approaches to freedom and liberty. One is prescriptive, and one is descriptive.
23:02:43 <dons> sjanssen: did you see that dwm 1.7 is out?
23:02:45 <vincenz> btw
23:03:01 <glguy> DFSG?
23:03:01 <vincenz> if you read it all, and go to the homepage of tannenbaum, you'll also get some cool history about this guy writing a book against linux
23:03:04 <vincenz> brown
23:03:05 <dons> seems to be a little faster, and layout is rememberd across screens (which is _much_ better)
23:03:20 <vincenz> should read about that, what that guy writes is insane
23:03:36 <shapr> glguy: Debian Free Software Guidelines say that the goal of Debian is to distribute binary/source with as few restrictions as possible.
23:04:01 * glguy doesn't see the GPL as a "free" license, but simply as a different set of restrictions than typical commerical licenses have.
23:04:42 <vincenz> glguy: agreed
23:04:55 <vincenz> glguy: LGPL is better imho :)
23:05:06 <glguy> and BSD is better still ;)
23:05:51 <shapr> I'm actually in favor of the GPL after my experiences being an employee at various companies.
23:06:16 <glguy> What experiences led you to that?
23:06:19 <shapr> Even when they could not use my code they would never release it.
23:06:23 <vincenz> shapr: personally I favor LGPL, GPL makes the code impossible to use
23:07:03 <shapr> I wrote a powerpoint clone for the Nokia 9210 in 600 lines of Jython. The company said it was cute, but they wanted to stick with Java. And they wouldn't release the source.
23:07:23 <vincenz> I haven't read the text, just looked at the figures, seems xahlee wrote something which could bei nteresting
23:07:26 <vincenz> http://xahlee.org/lang_traf/index.html
23:07:28 <lambdabot> Title: Xah: Computer Language Popularity Trend
23:07:33 <shapr> I think the GPL makes sure the code won't be 'stolen' by a company. GPL doesn't make it illegal to sell, it just means you have to give the source to those you sell the binaries to.
23:08:16 <dcoutts__> GPL is great for companies that want to release code
23:08:16 <vincenz> shapr: which is an enormous constraint on most businesses
23:08:21 <shapr> I disagree.
23:08:40 <shapr> That is, I do not believe that the GPL constrains companies at all.
23:08:57 <vincenz> Not all companies feel like releasing code
23:09:02 <dcoutts__> I don't think IBM or any of the other big corperate players would be working on Linux if it wasn't GPL
23:09:04 <shapr> Sure, but that's just a feeling.
23:09:11 <vincenz> shapr: hardly
23:09:22 <dcoutts__> since it wouldn't be a level playing field
23:09:38 <shapr> Can you give me an economic reason why companies shouldn't release source code?
23:09:55 <shapr> (warning, this is a sucker question)
23:10:01 <dcoutts__> it allows a company to release code without the fear that it'll be unfairly exploited by another company
23:10:39 <dcoutts__> since if another company does pick it up then you can pick up their derivitaves too
23:10:47 <dcoutts__> LGPL is too weak for that
23:11:00 <dcoutts__> though LGPL is great for many other purposes, I use it a lot
23:11:00 <shapr> That's part of why a company should release their source under the GPL.
23:11:18 <skew> shapr: cause a user who digs around in the program directory might be scared by it?
23:11:30 <skew> you got any ideas?
23:11:52 <vincenz> You should read the article by brown, the one in response to tannenbaum.  While highly inflamator, he does make a few good points regarding traceability.  The problem with GPL is that you're leaking information you might not want to leak.  I work at a research institute.   The major fund-raiser for my specific group is methodologies, which people buy by collaborating and opting in.  If we start gpling tools, people could deduce a lot fro
23:12:00 <dcoutts__> skew: only needs a promise of source code, not necessarily the source bundled in the program directory.
23:12:12 <shapr> I know the common arguments against businesses using the GPL, but most of the arguments don't actually make any economic sense.
23:12:57 <vincenz> shapr: well I was going to talk about a company I priorly worked at, though that was less strong a point.
23:14:05 <shapr> The counterpoint to your argument is that most companies haven't invented anything new, and if they release code they're using under the GPL, they might get a commercial advantage when others use/extend that code.
23:14:32 <vincenz> shapr: well in this cae the counterpoint is invalid
23:14:53 <gour> shapr: what about those who invented something?
23:15:45 <shapr> I'm not convinced, because I don't think source code alone holds as much knowledge/understanding as people believe. The real knowledge and value in a company is in the people who work there. The code is a tool that those people use.
23:15:56 <shapr> gour: Like what?
23:16:38 <gour> shapr: some algorithm used for certain calculations which is produce of many-years-experience
23:16:59 <shapr> vincenz: I have no doubt there are cases where the GPL is not economically beneficial, but I haven't seen many.
23:18:14 <shapr> gour: I can understand that being a good reason to not release that particular piece of code. But still, algorithms have limits, and don't help so much unless you know when and how to use a particular algorithm.
23:18:40 <shapr> gour: In that case, why not release the product as GPL and sell your spiffy algorithm as a plugin?
23:19:06 <skew> anybody know about selector thunks? http://paste.lisp.org/display/26873
23:19:27 <gour> shapr: that's good point which i'm considering too. but can plugin be non-gpl?
23:19:42 <shapr> I think so, but I'm not totally sure.
23:20:37 <gour> shapr: that's why i was/am thinking about lgpl...
23:20:48 <kilimanjaro> Probably. You don't have to GPL something just because it uses GPL software.
23:21:23 <gour> kilimanjaro: i thought just the opposite
23:21:25 <glguy> plug-ins written against GPL software are generally considered derivative works and are also GPL'd
23:21:29 <dcoutts__> well, it depends on if/how you link to it
23:21:52 <gour> dcoutts__: linking with the existing haskell technology :-)
23:22:02 <dons> Having the method of linking affect the license is a fundamentally broken idea
23:22:11 <dcoutts__> well, not totally
23:22:12 <dons> it's so silly
23:22:14 * vincenz nods at dons 
23:22:20 <dcoutts__> consider that Cabal could call cpphs
23:22:26 <dcoutts__> but doesn't depend on cpphc
23:22:31 <dcoutts__> it can use cpp too
23:22:38 <dcoutts__> it's got optional support
23:22:50 <dons> it should be a matter of _what code is used/called/whatever_
23:22:54 <dcoutts__> so is that linking ? should that mean the Cabal must be GPL rather than BSD ?
23:22:56 <dons> not whether you link it statically or dynamically
23:23:01 <kilimanjaro> Yes, it does depend on how you link to it. But my argument is that BSD systems can rely on GPL software without it spreading to the entire system.
23:23:18 * gour doesn't like idea of linking influence the license too
23:23:34 <dcoutts__> dons: so system ("cpphs") ? is that code that is called? am I affected by its licence ?
23:23:45 <dons> reminds me a bit of the defintiion of 'decryption device'
23:23:58 <dcoutts__> heh
23:24:11 <kilimanjaro> dcoutts__: Yea, that's what I was just going to mention ;)
23:24:14 <dcoutts__> like the peice of paper with the algorithm spec
23:24:27 <dons> yeah, or a haskell version presented as pseudocode...
23:25:03 <dcoutts__> dons: on another topic... I'm trying to figure out a nice monadic api for generating lazy bytestrings, perhaps you can help me.
23:25:11 <dons> calling some code over a pipe should be no different legally to calling it via a function call
23:25:19 <dons> its just a _calling convention_
23:25:40 <dcoutts__> even if you don't know statically that you are going to use it ?
23:26:03 <skew> anybody know about these selector thunks?
23:26:06 <dcoutts__> there do seem to be grey areas
23:26:10 <skew> using -ddump-simpl, it seems to be producing them
23:26:25 <kilimanjaro> Must higher-order programs be GPLed?
23:26:26 <dons> yeah. the boundaries defining the "edge" of a software project are very fuzzy
23:26:33 <dons> but the legal world assumes they're clean cut
23:26:43 <dons> its all just code in a big mushy pile
23:27:02 <dibblego> it's all fun
23:27:17 <kilimanjaro> foobat > tar -czf out.tar
23:27:30 <kilimanjaro> "error: foobat is not GPL"
23:29:15 <skew> anybody know about these selector thunks?

23:30:34 <lispy> it's all good
23:30:47 <lispy> mushy_pile_of_code++
23:30:59 <skew> wierd, building with -ddump-simpl it is making selector thunks

23:51:05 <dcoutts__> @tell SyntaxNinja I didn't get this email about hackage/unstable, but from your description it sounds like a good idea. Post to cabal-devel.

23:52:11 <dons> Haskell Weekly News, 27th Sept out now! http://sequence.complete.org/
23:52:28 <dons> really big issue, thanks to the power of automation :)
23:54:23 <dcoutts__> yay
23:55:19 <dons> with just a couple more scripts, its possible to prepare the entire issue in an hour or so, 2 to 3x better than it used to be, and with a lot more content. so that's good
23:55:31 <dons> I think it might actually be sustainable at this evel
23:56:02 <dcoutts__> great
23:56:21 <dons> the big win is the scripts to generating .txt, .html and .wiki versions from a single source, check links, and spelling, along with ndm's idea for a script to search gmane. that made this issue a lot easier to prepare
23:56:30 <dcoutts__> dons: now all you need to do is add to your script to email it to news@lwn.net or whatever it is
23:56:43 <dons> ah yes. i never read lwn.
23:56:57 <dons> is lwn the one that you have to _subscribe_ to read?
23:57:22 <dcoutts__> well some articles are subscriber only for the first week
23:57:27 <dons> I'm a little cautious about sending my content to them, only to have them charge people for it.
23:57:34 <dibblego> why not use docbook or latex?
23:57:37 <dcoutts__> it's a really good publication
23:57:48 <dcoutts__> best linux journalism on the net
23:57:55 * dcoutts__ is a subscriber
23:57:57 <dons> yeah, maybe my concern is misplaced.
23:58:15 <dons> i feel kind of weird about them charging for what i have to do for free though.
23:58:23 <dcoutts__> they're only just scraping along, not making a mint out of your free content
23:58:30 <dons> hehe :)
23:58:50 <dcoutts__> the weekly edition is available to all after one week
23:59:03 <dons> now, someone want to link to the weekly news on programming.reddit.com ?
23:59:30 <dons> (hopefully someone picks it up from planet.haskell.org anyway)
23:59:35 <dcoutts__> dons: and it gets good google scores, when I google for gtk2hs I still get old announcements on lwn.
23:59:48 <dcoutts__> dons: and ocaml do it!
23:59:53 <dons> huh. yeah. we should. ok.
