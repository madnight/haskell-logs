00:49:33 <pediddle> night
00:54:08 <a5> does it make sense to put my libraries in cabal packages, even if i'm the only user?
01:11:27 <foxy> if I have a source file that specifies a isa/hasa hierarchy, what mechanism can I use in haskell to represent the arbitrary number/type of, for example, hasa relationships?
01:12:11 <foxy> I seem to remember Trex being able to do something like this
01:13:32 <lightstep> Map Entity ([Entity], [Entity]) ?
01:20:00 <foxy> what if Entity is of type Entity a, then I can
01:20:15 <foxy> 't have a list of [Entity a] with a polymorphic
01:20:37 <foxy> @eval [3,'this']
01:20:38 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 6):
01:20:38 <lambdabot> unexpected "h"
01:20:38 <lambdabot> expecting end of character
01:20:49 <foxy> @eval [3,"this"]
01:20:50 <lambdabot> [3, this]
01:21:15 <lightstep>  @eval isn't haskell
01:21:25 <lightstep>  @pugs is
01:21:33 <Cale> no
01:21:36 <lightstep> no?
01:21:37 <Cale> @plugs :)
01:21:38 <lambdabot> parse error on input `)'
01:21:41 <foxy> @type [3,"this"]
01:21:43 <lambdabot> bzzt
01:21:55 <foxy> @plugs [3,"this"]
01:21:57 <lambdabot> <Plugins.Eval>:1:
01:21:57 <lambdabot>     No instance for (Num [Char])
01:21:57 <lambdabot>       arising from the literal `3'
01:22:06 <skew> I suppose we could implement a @pugs if we felt a pressing need to be able to evaluate perl6
01:22:16 <lightstep> @type [Left 3, Right "this"]
01:22:17 <lambdabot> [Left 3, Right "this"] :: forall a. (Num a) => [Either a [Char]
01:22:17 <lambdabot> ]
01:22:48 <lightstep> that's fine. so if Entity is the union type of all entities, it'll type
01:23:42 <mauke> @pugs 2+2
01:23:43 <lambdabot> 4
01:38:03 <a5> how long does it take to learn autoconf/automake?
01:39:21 <Heffalump> a lifetime?
01:39:26 <lightstep> info automake seems simple
01:39:42 <a5> i've been putting it off because i hate m4
01:39:53 <a5> but it seems necessary if one wants to release software
01:39:58 <a5> what about cabal?
01:45:03 <Heffalump> fairly easy to use
01:45:09 <Heffalump> just copy another project's cabal file and change it
01:45:38 <a5> is it based on / coexisting with / independent of autoconf?
01:46:14 <dons> autoconf isn't too bad. about as hard as writing shell scripts (with the lack of safety that implies)
01:47:40 <Oejet> Do you know a way to extract dependencies from a configure script or configure.ac?
01:48:11 <dons> C lib dependencies, I guess? or dependencies in general?
01:48:33 <dons> I don't know of a way, other than applying sed/perl to the configure script.
01:49:00 <Oejet> General.
01:49:47 <dons> I wish there was a way. Build scripts for packages could be generated automatically.
01:50:24 <dons> configure.ac represents this information in a very unstructured/untyped way, so it wouldn't be a nice job.
01:50:41 <dons> we need typed autoconf!
01:51:13 <dons> along the lines of the nice types in the Cabal code for dependencies of various flavours
01:51:31 <Oejet> Exactly, you have to run configure to get that information.
01:52:00 <dons> yep.
01:52:04 <tuomov> autoconf is a quick&dirty hack that has put proper package management back decades..
01:52:17 <dons> definitely
01:52:26 <Oejet> tuomov: And they even say so in the info docs. ;-)
01:52:41 <dons> a sh dsl, what were they thinking??
01:53:58 <a5> well as long as you provide an executable "configure" that responds to certain options, there is no compatibility barrier right?
02:02:12 <Oejet> a5: I don't think so, no.
02:04:56 <bourbaki> moin
02:07:31 <sorje> mhh building a darcs snapshot of hs-plugin with ghc 6.4 and failing with "Rebuilding dependencies ... Could not find module `Data.List':" strikes me as somewhat strange. :-/

02:52:31 <JaffaCake> morning all
02:52:42 <malcolm> Hi JaffaCake
03:18:48 <JohnMeacham> morning.
03:19:24 <nlv11757_> mornig
03:20:57 <JohnMeacham> Of what kind is the scrutinee in a case statement? (in ghc) '?' seems like the right one. but am unsure how to check.
03:21:55 <JohnMeacham> and let bound expressions must be '*' right?
03:22:30 <nlv11757_> right
03:22:40 <Heffalump> what's the difference between ? and *?
03:22:50 <Heffalump> aargh, ignore that last ? :-)
03:23:28 <skew> JohnMeacham: try to take a case of an unboxed tuple
03:24:23 <JohnMeacham> skew: yeah, my experimenting says that is the case, but I rarely trust experiment.
03:24:39 <JohnMeacham> (solely)
03:25:18 <skew> I'm pretty sure that the corroborates the User's Guide
03:25:19 <JohnMeacham> http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/types/Kind.lhs?rev=1.19  talks about them all.
03:26:23 <JohnMeacham> indeed. okay. I am convinced.
03:27:18 <Heffalump> why can't an unboxed tuple be an argument?
03:30:13 <JohnMeacham> implementation issues I think. I am not sure what they exactly are in ghc, but I can see it confusing calling conventions. also, I don't think there would be any benefit becaues it would equivalant to passing the elements as seperate arguments.
03:30:42 <foxy> a version of the eval function from hs-plugins that takes a haskell syntax tree instead of a [Char] would be nifty
03:30:44 <JohnMeacham> Although, it does capture that the function may never be partially applied... which could be useful info to the optimizer.
04:37:26 <nlv11757_> does anyone know of a Haskell application that solves a system of linear inequalities ?
04:37:42 <nlv11757_> thus, that i can reuse :)
04:40:28 <nlv11757_> everybody still lunching? :)
04:43:01 <Baughn> That, and discovering Haskell.
04:43:32 <Baughn> On that note, what would you recommend for a REPL? hugs98 isn't compiling; should I spend to time to make it compile?
04:43:34 <nlv11757_> your impression until now?
04:44:10 <Baughn> Great for anything that can be reasonably reduced to mathematics, but won't be replacing Lisp anytime soon.
04:44:36 <Baughn> Well.. you might want to ask again once I've spent a few weeks using it. ;)
04:44:41 <nlv11757_> :)
04:45:08 <nlv11757_> i just found lisp a bith vague and only applicable in AI applications
04:45:22 <nlv11757_> ow no, that was prolog
04:45:24 <nlv11757_> my bad
04:45:25 <Baughn> Hmm. Have you seen the Practical Common Lisp book?
04:45:32 <Baughn> Oh, okay. ;)
04:45:37 <Baughn> Er, :)
04:45:58 <nlv11757_> lisp is more imperative?
04:46:08 <Baughn> Lisp is whatever it wants to be.
04:46:34 <nlv11757_> hehe ok enough of the commercial
04:46:36 <Baughn> It isn't purely anything; it doesn't have as much support for functional programming as Haskell, but what'd you expect?
04:46:54 <nlv11757_> has it got more imperative than functional features
04:46:58 <nlv11757_> let's ask it like that
04:47:31 <Baughn> I'm not sure how to answer that, though.
04:47:49 <Baughn> If you count functions, most of them are purely functional - but that's also the case for C.
04:49:09 <nlv11757_> is it more declarative then imperative?
04:49:30 <Baughn> Yes, but maybe not in the sense you mean.
04:49:56 <Baughn> "Declarative programming" in Lisp can perfectly well cause side-effects.
04:50:14 <skew> Baughn: ghci is a nice repl
04:50:38 <skew> Though if you are having trouble getting hugs to build I don't expect GHC to be any better
04:50:50 <Baughn> I already installed the binary of GHC, though.
04:51:07 <Baughn> This Gentoo system is getting fubared; time to reinstall, methinks.
04:51:09 <nlv11757_> well if Haskell doesnt meet your needs because it doesn't provide you with enough impurities, you can always try ocaml i guess
04:51:35 <Baughn> Oy, I never said I wanted impurities.
04:52:15 <skew> Baughn: you didn't get ghci with that?
04:52:29 <Baughn> skew: Did, didn't know about it. Thanks.
04:52:35 <skew> mind, I don't know of anything that's like a full repl for the language
04:52:57 <skew> you can't define data types, type classes, or instances in any interpreter I know of
04:53:13 <skew> I don't think hugs even lets you make bindings that scope over the rest of the session
04:55:12 <MarcWeber> Hi. I'm new to Haskell but I know some C/C++/Java/python/pascal.. and I'm interested where the main differeces are. Do you know some a nice document describing this?
04:55:46 <Baughn> I'm sure there's some way in ghci to define functions, but...
04:57:34 <mflux> main differences? maybe like, everything ;)
04:57:59 <nlv11757_> nice concise description mflux ;)
04:58:20 <Baughn> MarcWeber: If you want something more familiar, you might try.. er, Lisp? Wait, that's not familiar..
04:58:39 <Baughn> MarcWeber: Haskell is more or less maths, is my impression. ^_^
04:58:44 <MarcWeber> Baughn: I don't want to have s.th. familiar. I want to learn s.th. new.
04:59:05 <Baughn> MarcWeber: Plenty of that around.
04:59:25 <mauke> no side effects, laziness, closures, autocurrying, typeclasses, type inference, pattern matching
04:59:40 <MarcWeber> I know you need very much time to write proper C/C++ code and I've read that functional programming is faster. so I should just start learn haskell to see the difference, I bet ;)
05:00:17 <Baughn> MarcWeber: You're really jumping into the deep end, you know. Haskell is a *pure* functional language.
05:00:51 <Baughn> MarcWeber: On the other hand, that *is* the fastest way to get in.
05:01:04 <MarcWeber> That's why I'm intersted. To get to know the differnce. Have to be awk for 2h. screen will be running ;)
05:22:30 <bourbaki> moin
05:23:31 <nlv11757_> same back at ya
05:23:47 <bourbaki> heh
05:24:18 <SM_ax> how can functional programming be faster (design speed) if there are so few libraries?
05:24:54 <nlv11757_> because a mathmatical algorithm may map trivially on a Haskell program
05:24:58 <nlv11757_> for example
05:25:26 <nlv11757_> so write it down in almost exactly the same way as you think about it
05:26:14 <SM_ax> well, it does not matter for imperative: use appropriate library
05:26:52 <nlv11757_> appropriate means exactly implemented the solution to your problem? lol
05:27:12 <nlv11757_> that must be one generic library
05:27:12 <SM_ax> no :)
05:27:31 <SM_ax> algorithm
05:29:29 <SM_ax> you don't have to implement most of the mathematical algorithm -- it is easy to find a module with algorithm you need, than quickly fine tune it for you problem.
05:30:38 <nlv11757_> maybe design speed can also be thought of in the long run; maintaining adapting. I think functional programming can greatly help here
05:32:52 <skew> SM_ax: Baughn meant learning Haskell is the fastest way to get into functional programming because it's the most extreme form
05:33:01 <SM_ax> Are there any visual tools (or at least paradigms) for functional programming like UML for imperative?
05:33:12 <Oejet> SM_ax: Your point is not really about functinal programming it's about size of the community.
05:33:58 <skew> besides, libraries don't really slow down design in the math style. "Let us assume that there is a library L with such and such an interface ....
05:34:05 <skew> :)

06:07:38 <skew> Some objected.

06:40:24 * boegel yawns
06:56:26 * shapr yawns
06:57:21 <bourbaki> whats the opposit of yawn?
06:59:23 <shapr> hyperventilate?
07:04:31 <Oejet> What's a good free license for an FFI binding to a BSD-style licensed C library (Bzlib2)?
07:05:25 <Oejet> I was thinking of LGPL.
07:05:55 <mflux> why not just bsd?
07:06:14 <mflux> given that basically wrapping another library doesn't really bring much value to it
07:06:54 <mflux> I've seen gpl-wrappers for bsd-code (ocaml-ssl), and that approach does annoy me slightly
07:16:49 <Function> hello
07:17:04 <Function> I'm working on an application which has to be partially Haskell
07:17:11 <Function> (existing code)
07:17:16 <Function> now I was wondering
07:17:41 <Function> is there an easy way to pass data structures between Haskell and say, Perl or PHP?
07:18:34 <sylvan> Function: You might go via C
07:18:59 <musasabi> BSD is simplest.
07:19:11 <Function> sylvan: ai that sounds like quite a detour
07:19:36 <Function> the current module which is Haskell works on a structure best described as a struct containing structs
07:19:43 <sylvan> yeah maybe.. I've only ever interfaced with C and it's quite straightforward
07:19:56 <Function> I was thinking about using XML through pipes or something like that
07:20:07 <Function> sylvan: right, how does that work?
07:21:05 <musasabi> passing XML over pipes can work.
07:21:18 <Function> still seems like a detour though
07:21:24 <Function> there's no existing bridge code?
07:21:29 <musasabi> but of course it won't help if the code uses functions inside structures.
07:21:34 <musasabi> to C.
07:22:04 <Function> the Haskell code operates on a structure
07:22:12 <Function> and returns a similar structure
07:22:23 <nlv11757_> lol, "C only provides call by value", that sounds so safe
07:22:32 <Function> nlv11757_: haha
07:22:53 <nlv11757_> that is really making it look waaaaay better than it is
07:23:08 <Function> yeah
07:23:17 <Function> like there's no such thing as pointer spaghetti
07:23:31 <nlv11757_> not that it's bad or anything...it just doesnt help since everybody can just pass addresses
07:23:33 <nlv11757_> exactly
07:23:48 <nlv11757_> im not really into C, so that sentence fooled me for 1 sec.
07:23:51 <Oejet> musasabi: I think the same license as GHC then will be fine.
07:23:52 <Function> heh
07:23:58 <Function> feck
07:24:01 <Function> right
07:24:15 <Function> now is there an easy way to "serialize" structures in Haskell then?
07:24:15 <mflux> what is the license for the parts that ghc links into the produced binary?
07:24:23 <Function> or does that have to be hand-coded too?
07:24:35 <nlv11757_> wasnt someone here working on serializing structures in haskell?
07:24:46 * nlv11757_ thinks who it was
07:25:00 <CosmicRay> haxml has some support for that
07:25:07 <Function> CosmicRay: hooray
07:25:26 <nlv11757_> arghh, i cant remember, someone here was working on a serializing library
07:25:27 <Oejet> mflux: http://www.bzip.org/, BSD-style license.
07:25:57 <Function> if haxml provides some basics that would be almost great
07:25:58 <Function> heh
07:27:05 <shapr> You could go extracheesy and use xmlrpc to get PHP and Haskell to talk.
07:27:33 <Function> aiee
07:27:37 <Function> actually
07:27:42 <Function> wait, that might work in my case
07:27:54 <Function> XML-RPC is quite generic
07:28:26 <mflux> xml for something is basically IPC? huh :)
07:28:36 <musasabi> nlv11757_: I have a serialization library.
07:28:47 <Function> mflux: if you know a better way
07:28:50 <musasabi> nlv11757_: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/SerTH/
07:28:52 <Function> than please
07:29:10 <Function> err, s/than/then/ even
07:29:31 <shapr> Hm, I think I started a small flamewar in LtU when I said that "In my opinion unit tests and static typing can have roughly the same functionality." (but note that I was talking about my paying Zope work)
07:30:23 * shapr brands himself a heretic
07:30:36 <shapr> g'day timbod
07:31:01 <timbod> Hi shapr
07:31:05 <shapr> How's code?
07:31:37 <timbod> was that a while ago that you said that on ltu? Do you still think that?
07:31:38 <musasabi> shapr: I think static types are more similar to pre- and postconditions than unittests (of course with the check-time being different)
07:35:39 <nlv11757_> ah musasabi, i knew it was someone. Function was looking for one and i remembered someone had one
07:36:12 <timbod> Actually, thinking about it a bit more - I guess you are right. <static typing+tests> versus <dynamic typing + more tests> both _can_ have the same functionality if you consider that both are means of producing code of adequate quality. The open question is which one requires less effort to get there...

07:42:12 <foxy> is CPid an unsigned int?
07:42:27 * shapr doesn't know
07:42:43 <timbod> shapr: yep, thanks. I was interesting in stuff presently packaged with cabal (other than itself!)
07:43:23 <shapr> timbod: ghc 6.4 now requires cabal, you can't do it the way it was done before. That change means that cabal is used for *lots* of packages.
07:43:23 <timbod> shapr: By the way, nice work on the monad reader
07:43:44 <shapr> Thanks :-) But I only did organization, the authors put in the real work.
07:44:50 <timbod> shapr: I didn't realise that ghc was now using cabal internally. I guess that means it's beyond the proof of concept stage.
07:45:13 <shapr> Definitely.
07:45:59 <shapr> timbod: do you want to write a TMR article?
07:46:03 <timbod> btw, the wiki format for the monad reader is nice online, though I did like issue one in pdf form - it was easier to read on the ferry.
07:47:15 <musasabi> One can use the new version of ghc-pkg directly too, but that is not very nice.
07:47:25 <musasabi> Usually just writing the cabal file is easier.
07:47:26 <shapr> Yeah, I like the readability/printability of pdf and ps. I'm pretty sure we'll stick with wikipublishing because that meant I wasn't the only proofreader and reviewer.
07:48:10 <shapr> Someone said they may hack up a wiki syntax to LaTeX converter, that would give some benefits of both approaches.
07:48:14 <timbod> hmmm - I'm not sure I've got the knowledge, or something interesting to say. I'll have a think about it though - it deserves support.
07:48:45 <foxy> I'm getting lots of errors (at dynamic link) such as "unknown symbol `__stginit_Prelude_`" when I try to run the hs-plugins test programs. (I'm trying to make it run on cygwin)
07:49:05 <foxy> what sort of thing should I look for to correct this type of error?
07:49:27 <shapr> Wiki syntax can't do as much as LaTeX, but the wiki does allow inline LaTeX... I'm not sure where this is all going, but I'm sure it'll be fun.
07:49:49 <timbod> Perhaps an article from droundy on collaborative haskell development, or haskell performance tuning on big structure?
07:50:33 <shapr> Hm, that's an idea. David on patch theories, new and old. I'll ask him if he has time.
07:51:04 <shapr> I'd like an article by Igloo on darcs tuning and how to apply it to other larger Haskell apps.
07:51:55 <timbod> It must be a challenge to get people to commit the time. Have you got enough lined up for another issue?
07:52:14 <timbod> What does Igloo do (wrt haskell)?
07:55:10 <shapr> everything!
07:56:19 <shapr> I usually try to line up fifteen articles, that way I end up with five that really get published.
07:59:14 <timbod> That sounds both pessimistic, and reasonable :-(
07:59:56 <shapr> Well, you're right, it is a challenge for people to commit the time. Lots of people have interesting content, but 'real life' gets in the way.
08:00:51 <d`> shapr that describes a lot more than just programming in haskell (or whatever you're talking about right now)
08:00:58 <shapr> Also, a partially completed article doesn't just disappear, some article were aimed for the first issue and got into the second issue, some have had some work spread across both of the issues that have just happened.
08:01:54 <shapr> One example is my Template Haskell tutorial that still isn't finished, but has twice had hopes of getting into 'this issue'
08:02:32 <ski> hello shapr
08:02:36 <shapr> hej ski
08:03:25 * ski thinks he sees a typo in FunWithLinearImplicitParameters
08:03:38 <shapr> timbod: On the good side, as editor I get to read all the nifty in-progress articles, so I see just how much great stuff is happening in the Haskell community.
08:04:35 <shapr> Maybe that would be better shared? Should the list of Possible Articles be available to the public?
08:05:40 <d`> think open-source ;]
08:05:44 <d`> sure ;]
08:06:30 <timbod> Perhaps, but there's something pleasing in an old fashioned way about ripping off the cover to see what's in the new issue.
08:07:01 <shapr> Hm, true.
08:09:05 <nlv11757_> my god, does there have to be a zillion data dependence tests
08:09:12 <nlv11757_> how am i supposed to choose :)
08:12:23 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
08:12:37 <hyp3rion> Good evening.
08:12:48 * shapr boings cheerfully
08:12:49 <dcoutts_> good afternoon
08:13:25 <shapr> dcoutts_: Hey, will you have time for a gtk2hs article for tmr3? :-)
08:13:26 * ski fails creating user on tmrwiki
08:13:51 <shapr> ski: you should be able to make comments without being logged in
08:14:00 <dcoutts_> shapr, I think so, deadline week before end of May right?
08:14:07 <shapr> yup
08:14:46 <shapr> Though with the wikipublishing you can get peer review, grammar/spell checking, etc by throwing your content into the wiki and letting the other authors look at it.
08:14:56 <ski> shapr : mhm, hadn't tried that :) (habit of editing nonanonymously on hawiki ..)
08:21:05 <bourbaki> moin
08:25:38 <timbod> off to sleep - shapr: I'll have a think about an article.
08:27:14 <nibro> oi shapr, what ails scannedinavian.org?
08:27:19 <shapr> Is it broken?
08:27:42 <nibro> well, my browser keeps saying 'loading' on http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/CategoryBinaries
08:28:07 <shapr> well, first of all DarcsWiki has moved to darcs.net, and second of all, it looks like Luleå is having network problems again.
08:29:04 <nibro> heh, I followed the link from http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/, thought that was the official page
08:29:16 <foxy> how do I get lambdabot to look up a variable name?
08:29:29 <shapr> It is, I don't know who maintains that webpage.
08:29:40 <shapr> I would assume it's David.
08:30:00 <nibro> I think so yes, so the two links points to the same page I suppose
08:31:15 <foxy> or, how do I find where the function unpackCString resides?
08:31:27 <shapr> @index unpackCString
08:31:28 <lambdabot> bzzt
08:31:49 <shapr> It's not in the standard libs, sounds like it'll be in the FFI.
08:31:52 <nibro> I would suspect Foreign.C
08:32:04 <nibro> or even Foreign.C.CString or some such
08:33:29 <nibro> Foreign.C.String has a lot of operations on CStrings, but not that one
08:33:36 <foxy> its not, I just checked.  My program won't link because of an unknown symbol _GHCziBase_unpackCStringzh_closure
08:36:13 <shapr> Since I have a lot of paying work to do right now, I have the sudden urge to reformat the QuotesPage so that I can easily use it with fortune, and create a haskell-quotes deb.
08:39:03 <shapr> Hm, HC&AR hasn't been updated, that sucks.
08:39:11 <shapr> As in, I haven't sent in *my* updates.
08:39:16 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/communities/topics.html
08:40:00 <foxy> does ghc need to be compiled with -prof if -prof is used in the compilation of a user program?
08:40:14 <hyp3rion> no
08:40:40 <shapr> I think only the libs the user program requires must be -prof also.
08:40:59 <shapr> Standard GHC installations include foo and foo_prof libs.
08:41:09 <reffie> i think i'll rewrite this markov chain script in haskell.
08:41:19 <shapr> oh yes!
08:41:26 <foxy> would that explain why I'm getting linking errors?
08:41:30 <shapr> I want some markov code in Haskell.
08:41:39 <shapr> foxy: possibly, what were your errors?
08:42:30 <foxy> shapr: unknown symbols such as `_GHCziBase_unpackCStringzh_closure`
08:43:58 <shapr> Does that only happen when you're building with -prof ?
08:46:45 <foxy> shapr: woops, no I'm not compiling with -prof, I thought I was, sorry (it's not my code)
08:47:18 <shapr> Personally, I think ethernet is an excellent conductor for phlogiston, and some people just have more than others and therefore tend to release it often.
08:48:53 <shapr> nibro: ScannedInAvian is back now.
08:48:53 <hyp3rion> What is phlogiston?
08:49:40 <foxy> @google phlogiston
08:49:41 <earthy> wasn't that the mythical carrier of light?
08:49:42 <lambdabot> http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/sci/A0838824.html
08:49:58 <earthy> oh, no, fire
08:50:42 <hyp3rion> Sounded like a hormone...
08:51:23 <nibro> shapr: cool, but I got my binary from the darcs.net wiki
08:53:15 <shapr> I have discovered a serious downside to having cute pix on my blog, my server is using quite a few extra gb because html message board weenies use pix as their avatars, signatures, etc
08:55:00 <shapr> Happily, my blog is written in Haskell so I can just tell it to rename the image names and links to a new name whenever my blog is updated.
08:59:46 <musasabi> shapr: another way is to use referrer and return a small optimized gif telling "don't steal art".
09:01:05 <shapr> I tried that.
09:01:55 <d`> most browsers don't give away the true refferer
09:02:03 <d`> as a security measure
09:03:50 <d`> and some allow to set a fixed refferer (like links for example), or to return the current site
09:06:09 <shapr> It looks like I've been using an extra few GB just for webboard weenies, possibly as much as an extra 25GB a month.
09:12:04 <musasabi> d`: but a 90% solution is enough.
09:12:34 <musasabi> d`: in fact something that works by default in IE (and optionally firefox/mozilla) is enough.
09:13:06 <musasabi> d`: who wants to have their avatar on a forum a picture most surfers will see as "don't steal art"?
09:13:12 <smott> i've yet to see a browser that faked the referer
09:14:03 <shapr> My web logs imply that quite a few browsers fake the referer.
09:14:16 <shapr> But those may be privacy proxies rather than the browser itself.
09:14:44 <musasabi> yep.
09:15:34 <aleator> Silly question, but how should I implement "f :: Seed -> (Double,Double) -> Double". Ie. function that associates pseudorandom number to x,y-coordinates? (using ghc)
09:16:24 * hyp3rion filled in the GHC survey and got "Unspecified action"
09:16:40 <CosmicRay> hyp3rion: did you click on the submit button or press enter?
09:17:17 <shapr> Sounds like web development in Haskell is a wash.
09:17:23 * shapr snickers at the evil pun
09:17:28 <hyp3rion> CosmicRay: I'm using lynx
09:17:30 <CosmicRay> very evil.
09:17:44 <CosmicRay> hyp3rion: that page probably requires a javascript-capable browser
09:17:46 <shapr> It's likely that the GHC Survey requires Javascript.
09:17:53 <CosmicRay> (which is one of my complaints about wash)
09:17:54 <hyp3rion> Yikes
09:18:01 <shapr> Yes, also my complaint.
09:18:18 <hyp3rion> CosmicRay: Ok then i retry with links2 :))
09:18:22 <Cale> aleator: have you looked at the stuff in http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System.Random.html ( http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/random.html )
09:18:28 <CosmicRay> shapr: well I'm having trouble adopting the halipeto model to my site, so I dropped an e-mail to andrew
09:19:18 <shapr> Cool, he's very helpful.
09:19:58 <CosmicRay> morning SyntaxNinja
09:20:15 <CosmicRay> shapr: I spent the last couple of hours just playing with it, starting from his hello world example.
09:20:28 <CosmicRay> shapr: I now know enough to know I don't know how to organize it for my site :-)
09:20:49 <shapr> haha
09:21:22 <shapr> He iterates over the top level, then the next level, etc
09:21:29 <shapr> And the level depth is hardcoded in a bunch of places.
09:21:40 <CosmicRay> right
09:21:42 <CosmicRay> that's my main problem
09:21:42 <shapr> I had to hack out various bits of code to make things work for my site.
09:21:52 <SyntaxNinja> heya CosmicRay
09:21:52 <d`> smott links allows this
09:21:53 <CosmicRay> I use pretty much one template for everything
09:22:05 <CosmicRay> but I have varying depths in different folders
09:22:19 <d`> smott at least links2
09:22:31 <smott> d`: so does w3m and probably a few other browsers, but i think all of them combined aren't more than 1% of the 'market'
09:22:38 <CosmicRay> and I'm not sure I can represent all this just by using repeat and still have the hiararchy work out right
09:24:04 <shapr> smott: yeah, but when you can't get X working for whatever reason, finding an X FAQ website that doesn't support text browsers is frustrating.
09:24:06 <aleator> Cale: Sure. But System.Random will allow me to generate stream of consecutive randoms. I need to assign one specific random number to each x,y-pair. (Of which there are really many)
09:24:16 <d`> smott yeah, probably so.
09:25:15 * d` hasn't used X for a log time, so is totally text-browser-compatibility aware ;]
09:28:10 <hyp3rion> The X-Free experience
09:29:33 <hyp3rion> d`: But are you using framebuffer?
09:29:43 <hyp3rion> And links2 in graphics mode?
09:30:03 <Cale> aleator: ah, to every pair of Doubles? Perhaps you want to take the doubles and incorporate them somehow in a seed
09:30:16 <Cale> (along with the original seed)
09:30:52 <aleator> Cale: I thought of that, but isn't creating a new generator (with the new seed) rather slow?
09:31:12 * aleator makes uninformed assumption.
09:32:09 <Cale> is it? I somehow doubt it's much slower than reading an extra number from an existing generator
09:32:54 <d`> hyp3rion now i use opera, but i used to use links2 in text mode
09:33:16 <d`> i still use it sometimes..
09:34:12 <aleator> Cale: I don't know. Perhaps I'll test it. Unless you know a good place to look it up..
09:34:19 <aleator> Cale: Thanks, though.
09:36:45 <Cale> aleator: you might also be interested in decodeFloat
09:41:17 <aleator> Cale: ah. Yes.
10:00:19 <aleator> Cale: Based on quick test, it seems that it generator used by ghc (ecuyar) does not slow down. But it seems not to generate really random numbers for not really random seeds. (First impression of mine, atleast)
10:00:41 <Cale> hmm...
10:01:29 <aleator> Perhaps I will multiply by large prime, and call it random :)
10:03:13 <musasabi> Is there any nifty software for keeping notes on papers?
10:03:56 <hyp3rion> aleator: Why not just read from /dev/random?
10:04:18 <xerox> yo
10:05:09 <aleator> hyp3rion: That will get me a stream of random numbers. I'm trying to map (x,y) pairs to pseudorandom numbers, without generating them all.
10:05:50 <shapr> musasabi: like what?
10:06:00 <hyp3rion> Aha sorry
10:10:54 <shapr> musasabi: Something that integrates scanned images, ocr, and text searching?
10:11:11 <Lemmih> @seen peti
10:11:12 <lambdabot> I haven't seen peti.
10:12:00 <shapr> Man, I'm so tempted to reply to the OCaml vs Haskell question on the mailing lists, but I bet I wouldn't be polite.
10:12:46 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: it would be far better to write a reasoned, intelligent reply, and add it to a FAQ :)
10:13:11 <shapr> Yes, that would be far more reasonable. But I think whatever I write will start the phlogiston flowing.
10:13:34 <mflux> write the reply..
10:13:36 <mflux> then delete it
10:13:41 <mflux> get it off your system..
10:13:42 <mflux> ;)
10:13:46 <xerox> But before then, post it ;-)
10:13:59 <shapr> mflux: Yeah, I like that pattern, I recommend that to a lot of people.
10:14:14 * shapr writes three times as many emails as he sends.
10:14:35 <shapr> On the good side, sometimes those abortive emails turn out to have some really useful content that I wouldn't have explored otherwise.
10:14:50 <SyntaxNinja> jeremey shaw wrote a great email to daniel carrera that should be a FAQ
10:20:17 <sorje> Mhh, manyTill x y eats the y :-/
10:21:01 <Lemmih> It also eats your stack space.
10:21:22 <sorje> Oh, that would be tolerable
10:22:00 <shapr> This is what bugs me about OCaml - "The language has fast, unchecked integers because people demand performance (as evidenced by the other thread about C-class performance). The performance is one factor which drives its acceptance for some real applications. But then we need to start retrofitting solutions to the problems which were created by the pursuit of performance."
10:22:30 <Lemmih> You can write your own which uses getInput/setInput to restore the tokens after y gets parsed.
10:23:22 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: yeah.
10:24:03 <basti_> hi
10:24:04 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: hm. I wonder if it's the case that speed can be tweaked and retro-fitted, but correctness has to be built from scratch
10:24:31 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: Personally, I think that's always the case.
10:25:48 <shapr> OCaml integers are 32 bit or 64 bit depending on which machine you're using.
10:30:18 <Huschi> SyntaxNinja: my packages for wxhaskell are ready!
10:31:27 <SyntaxNinja> Huschi: can you send me email with a link to where I can grab them, and any explanation you think I need to evaluate them?
10:31:49 <CosmicRay> shapr: actually, 31-bit or 63-bit.
10:31:54 <shapr> Ah, right.
10:31:56 <bourbaki> there is a 6th book of the hitchhikers guide???
10:32:20 <Huschi> SyntaxNinja: i've got no webspace. can i send them directly to you?
10:33:55 <SyntaxNinja> Huschi: are they huge?
10:34:06 <SyntaxNinja> bourbaki: no, it's a movie, you have to go to the theater ;)
10:34:42 <Huschi> SyntaxNinja: all toghether they are about 5.0M.
10:34:58 <Huschi> SyntaxNinja: or i can send them to you over irc.
10:35:02 <bourbaki> young zaphod plays it save
10:35:35 <SyntaxNinja> Huschi: go ahead and email, we'll see if it makes it through :)
10:37:54 <nibro> oi SyntaxNinja
10:38:21 <SyntaxNinja> hi nibro
10:39:11 <nibro> regarding Distribution.Extensions, isn't there an awful lot of duplication?
10:39:45 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: howso?
10:39:54 * shapr cackles evilly after reading "Are you sure that OCaml is similar to Haskell? At first glance, it doesn't even look functional. It looks like an imperative language."
10:40:26 <nibro> in particular OverlappingInstances, AllowOverlappingInstances, UnsafeOverlappingInstances
10:40:35 <gzl> shapr: haha, from the mailing list?
10:40:45 <shapr> yup
10:40:56 <dcoutts_> shapr, yeah, I liked that too! :-)
10:41:17 <dcoutts_> especially after reading some intricate ocaml code recently
10:41:21 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: well, basically that's it, so *some* duplication ;)
10:41:36 <dcoutts_> bleugh!
10:42:27 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: also I wonder about the InlinePhase and ContextStack items
10:42:55 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: I think there's one extra. AllowOverlappingInstances.
10:42:59 <CosmicRay> shapr: which mailing list?
10:42:59 <shapr> sylvan: That was a tactful reply, very nice.
10:43:06 <shapr> CosmicRay: haskell-cafe
10:43:08 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: are those really extensions per se, I'd judge them more as compiler pragmas...?
10:43:49 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: so OverlappingInstances and UnsafeOverlappingInstances are distinctly different you mean?
10:44:25 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: yeah
10:45:00 <SyntaxNinja> I'll mark AllowOverlappingInstances deprecated. thanks for the catch
10:45:14 <nibro> so what about the others I mentioned?
10:47:04 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: looking, hang on
10:50:14 <SyntaxNinja> what does -finline-phase do?
10:50:25 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I'm also missing a few entries there, I can think of UnboxedValues and FFI at least
10:50:34 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: inlines? =)
10:50:40 <SyntaxNinja> ffi is there
10:51:08 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: doh, it is, I guess I didn't look for the long version... ;)
10:51:27 <nibro> hmm... be back in a while
10:51:30 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: can you send me a mail with these notes?
10:51:42 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: sure
10:53:08 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: you wrote a chapter in haskell-v8 that refers to a.bad.pattern.hs, but that file isn't in the repo
10:53:15 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: do you think you could check it in?
10:54:35 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: pushed :)
10:55:19 <CosmicRay> got it, thanks!
11:02:33 * shapr pulls haskell-v8
11:02:38 <shapr> Oh hey
11:02:54 <shapr> The TMR license is BSD right, so I can hammer TMR content into haskell-v8?
11:03:31 <CosmicRay> sounds good to me
11:03:39 <CosmicRay> hmm, darcs push for me is failing.
11:03:43 <CosmicRay> darcs failed:  Error applying patch to recorded!
11:03:47 <CosmicRay> any ideas what that means?
11:04:20 * shapr dunno
11:05:47 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: there's the other issue of where the Extension module should reside
11:05:48 <Igloo> It probably means it conflicts with something in _darcs/patches/pending
11:05:57 <CosmicRay> Igloo: on the server?
11:06:06 <Igloo> Oh, sorry
11:06:24 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: what's your opinion on that?
11:06:42 <Igloo> It probably means it doesn't apply to _darcs/current for some reason
11:07:02 <CosmicRay> hmm, it is a patch that removes a file that doesn't appear to exist on the server.
11:07:05 <CosmicRay> something wacky is going on.
11:07:18 * CosmicRay wonders if scons is interfering in _darcs
11:09:22 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: not sure; Distribution.Version got moved to Data.Version simlarly
11:09:53 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: not sure where such belongs. maybe the Distribution hierarchy is misnamed; lots of it is sorta Stuff About Haskell
11:11:49 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: Perhaps Language.Haskell.Extension is a conceptually better place then
11:13:14 <musasabi> shapr: something that works for making general comments on them and searching.
11:13:34 <musasabi> shapr: usually I fuzzily remember reading a paper about something but cannot find it again.
11:13:39 <shapr> Yeah, me too
11:14:01 <shapr> Obviously time for me to kick FLM out the door, I only need to integrate CosmicRay's darcs code.
11:14:08 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: yeah, maybe.
11:15:57 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: is it currently the case that one must move a tarball from one place to another for it to get into the hackage database?
11:16:36 <shapr> musasabi: I think I can get FLM 0.1 out this weekend.
11:17:13 <shapr> musasabi: does wiki-annotation of page images work for you?
11:18:55 <Huschi> SyntaxNinja: the mauil is out.
11:19:31 <SyntaxNinja> Huschi: thanks.
11:20:11 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: would HierarchicalNamespace be considered an extension still? =)
11:21:12 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: what do you mean?
11:22:15 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I'm wondering where to draw the line of what an extension is. Formally, the hierarchical namespace is an extension to haskell98
11:22:35 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: yeah, it should be in there, I think.
11:23:20 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: well, then just about every package would depend on it, and all implementations support it by default
11:23:46 <SyntaxNinja> true
11:24:02 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: ... not to mention that it's fully conservative
11:24:33 <SyntaxNinja> well, there's nothing that forces users to list the extensions they use
11:24:44 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: maybe I'm just rambling, I'm reading through the list of extensions hugs allows and HNS is mentioned there
11:24:46 <SyntaxNinja> maybe we'd output a warning if we detected one that wasn't listed, but we currently don't
11:24:56 <SyntaxNinja> what do you mean fully conservative?
11:25:44 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I mean that a module written to work without the HNS extension will still work fully well if you include it, and nothing could ever break
11:26:54 <SyntaxNinja> yeah
11:27:03 <SyntaxNinja> I think it should be there for completeness
11:29:05 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: well, you're probably right, especially if we keep in mind that there might be other uses for a Language.Haskell.Extension module than either of us can imagine
11:29:09 <nibro> ;)
11:29:24 <nibro> so aye, in with it :)
11:30:17 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: ja
11:30:31 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: any idea what NamedFieldPuns is?
11:31:15 <nibro> or anyone else for that matter :)
11:31:24 <SyntaxNinja> not me
11:32:18 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: for the HTML interface; if the package doesn't provide a package-url, you could add one to the database based on where you're putting it :)
11:33:20 <nibro> shapr: what about you, the living haskell encyclopedia? =)
11:34:29 <shapr> er, yes?
11:34:36 <shapr> Why do you ask?
11:34:50 <nibro> shapr: what's named field puns?
11:34:56 <shapr> oh that
11:35:33 <nibro> the nhc98 user's guide says "Allow named field punning" =)
11:35:33 <shapr> http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:v3AF-bdh9NIJ:www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/docs/hugs/explain-13.html+named+field+puns+haskell&hl=en
11:37:07 <shapr> Seems to be "putCode code' s = s{code = code'}" vs "putCode code s = s{code}"
11:37:25 <nibro> hmmm, that's an interesting feature... I wonder what exactly the limits are, if it's usable in updates only...?
11:37:27 <shapr> I've heard of those before when I was looking at trex, but I've never read about them.
11:38:33 <nibro> shapr: thanks for the link :)
11:39:04 <shapr> btw, I am a very poor Haskell encyclopedia compared to someone like SPJ. I keep having cool ideas for neat stuff I could do in Haskell, then google turns up a paper he wrote about that same idea years ago.
11:39:12 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: here we go again: should CPP really be considered a Haskell language extension?
11:39:39 <nibro> shapr: that's a good sign
11:40:03 <CosmicRay> shapr: yeah, but you hang out on #haskell
11:40:19 <shapr> Is that a sign that I should get out of the webdev business and find a PhD position? =)
11:40:27 <nibro> shapr: see it this way: the ideas you have are relevant enough that someone like SPJ saw the need to write a paper on them ;)
11:40:37 <CosmicRay> shapr: no, it's a sign that you should integrate shaprpedia with lambdabot :-)
11:40:43 * shapr laughs
11:40:59 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: I think CPP is more like an extension
11:41:09 <shapr> I have been looking into doing CS or Math at Luleå. Their CS research doesn't excite me much though.
11:42:07 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I'd judge CPP on the same level as happy or alex files: as-of-yet-unpreprocessed haskell source
11:42:32 <shapr> Wasn't Johan Nordlander at Luleå for awhile?
11:43:09 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: what about arrows, then :)
11:43:22 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: arrows can be a preprocessor _or_ an extension
11:43:28 <SyntaxNinja> very similar to cpp
11:43:48 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I don't agree with that
11:43:59 <shapr> Aha! http://www.csee.ltu.se/~nordland/
11:44:21 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: arrows is a language extension, it's just implemented as a preprocessor
11:44:47 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: so why isn't that ugly #gook covering Haskell code an extension?
11:44:53 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: the same holds for my own pet projects HaRP and HSP
11:45:12 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: the fact that CPP is an abomination shouldn't make it less of an extension ;)
11:45:28 <shapr> Johan Nordlander definitely has similar interests. Can a universitetslektor be a PhD advisor?
11:45:29 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: what's the abstract syntax representation of a CPP-studded source doc?
11:45:42 <nibro> shapr: he could
11:45:57 <shapr> And there was great niftiness.
11:46:26 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: bah
11:46:26 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: but I get your point, it's difficult to draw a line somewhere
11:46:45 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: yeah, I don't want to split hairs too much on this. I did debate whether or not to include it
11:46:47 <shapr> Now I just have to plan out a high speed undergraduate course so I can get a bachelor's degree.
11:46:53 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: but the way Cabal works dictated that we include it
11:47:13 <SyntaxNinja> or if we could get everyone to name their abomination-laden code as .hscpp instead, but I don't think that'll happen
11:47:56 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: that would be by far the best thing yes
11:48:50 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: why not simply require everyone to give -cpp as a ghc-/hugs-/nhc-option in their cabal files?
11:49:14 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: that would teach them to name their files .hscpp ;)
11:49:17 <SyntaxNinja> cabal is occasionally too pragmatic for folks, but it has their own goals :)
11:49:17 <shapr> nibro: Can you suggest a website that gives an overview of the Swedish education system? Right now I'd like to see if I can test out of classes, but I'm sure I'll have more questions in the future.
11:49:27 <SyntaxNinja> er it has its own goals
11:50:12 <nibro> shapr: gee, I don't even know the system myself, but I could have a look around
11:50:40 <nibro> shapr: in particular I don't think anything I could dig up would cover graduate studies
11:51:01 <nibro> shapr: what kind of classes would you want to test out of?
11:51:02 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: hm. that's an option I guess, but like I said, I think it's splitting hairs to not be an extension.
11:51:31 <SyntaxNinja> nibro: also, cabal uses it to figure out whether it needs to run CPP for instance before running haddock
11:52:20 <shapr> I don't have any sort of degree yet, though I do have a bunch of credits in a bunch of different subjects. I think I can test out of most of the CS and some of the math, and possibly other subjects.
11:52:49 <nibro> shapr: what level are the courses on? high school or uni?
11:52:59 <shapr> University.
11:53:28 <shapr> I ended up taking whatever looked interesting rather than aiming for a degree.
11:53:45 <nibro> shapr: there's always http://www.hsv.se/sv/iwt/startpage/startpage.jsp?home=location
11:53:51 <shapr> On the good side, I think I actually learned a lot, and very few of my fellow students did :-)
11:54:05 <tuomov> isn't there some sort of open university?
11:54:20 <shapr> nibro: Ah, this is a good starting point, thanks!
11:54:21 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: does it ever hurt to run cpp?
11:54:26 <shapr> tuomov: I don't know.
11:54:50 <tuomov> at least in .fi you can take courses in "avoin yliopisto" and if you later apply for degree studies, they'll be noted
11:55:03 <tuomov> it costs something, though
11:55:31 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: I'm sure you understand my take on the cpp business, working with haskell-src
11:56:07 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: to me a haskell extension is something that we could extend haskell-src to cover
11:56:38 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: ... or it's not a syntactic extension
11:57:36 <nibro> SyntaxNinja: regardless of how much we try, there's no way we could make haskell-src handle pre-cpp code
11:58:16 <shapr> tuomov: Thanks, I'll ask around and see if there's something equivalent in .se
12:14:44 <mwc> the type reference guide sure helps finding fucntions
12:14:52 <mwc> http://www.zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputglobal/typesIndex.html
12:15:03 <shapr> Ah, the postman arrived?
12:15:14 <mwc> yep
12:15:22 <shapr> Cool, how's it going?
12:15:29 <shapr> Keeping you off your feet? :-)
12:15:54 <mwc> Well enough, I was trying to find something olong the lines of roll (x:xs) = xs ++ [x]
12:16:06 <mwc> but I guess that doesn't occur in the prelude
12:16:22 <shapr> concat
12:16:42 <shapr> @plugs concat ["abc","def","umm"]
12:16:48 <lambdabot> "abcdefumm"
12:17:01 <shapr> @plugs concat [[1..5],[9..12]]
12:17:03 <lambdabot> [1,2,3,4,5,9,10,11,12]
12:17:28 <mwc> yeah, I was looing for a function to do the rolling of the list. figured using a prelude function might theoretically be more optimizeable
12:17:52 <shapr> Prelude functions often have desirable properties in terms of speed and laziness.
12:18:15 <shapr> Sometimes you get two, and you have to figure out which one is strict and which is lazy.
12:19:56 <mwc> hah, great
12:20:22 <mwc> so rollHead (x:xs) = xs ++ [x] is lazy enough?
12:20:59 <pediddle> mwc: you might try ([a],[a]) type
12:21:11 <pediddle> take an element from the first list, cons it to the second
12:21:37 <shapr> Oh right, you're building a ring buffer, what am I thinking...
12:22:02 <pediddle> then when the first is empty, reverse the second list into the first and start over
12:22:13 <mwc> shapr: actually, I have a list of vertices and I need to create a list of consecutive edge vectors
12:22:36 <pediddle> you might also look at cycle
12:22:36 <mwc> so I was gonna do a zipWith ptSubtract vs (rollHead vs)
12:22:47 <pediddle> @type cycle
12:22:52 <lambdabot> cycle :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
12:23:21 <mwc> if I create a cyclic list I can't use map or zip* ?
12:24:01 <basti_> why not?
12:24:26 <mwc> basti_: seems to me that they'd create an infinite list as well
12:24:31 <basti_> so what? =)
12:24:35 <mwc> which means I can't use recursion down the list anymore
12:24:43 <basti_> well it will never come to an end of course
12:24:48 <basti_> but maybe you want just that
12:25:02 <basti_> @pugs take 10 $ map (10*) $ cycle [1,2,3]
12:25:04 <lambdabot> [10,20,30,10,20,30,10,20,30,10]
12:25:08 * basti_ shrugs
12:25:17 <mwc> I need top operate across the dot products of the nth-pair of vectors
12:25:33 <mwc> I was going ot use recusion as a stopping criterion.
12:25:47 <basti_> you shouldnt make a vector with infinite dimension, no.
12:25:49 <pediddle> @plugs zip [1..10] (cycle [100..500])
12:25:52 <lambdabot> [(1,100),(2,101),(3,102),(4,103),(5,104),(6,105),(7,106),(8,107)
12:25:52 <lambdabot> ,(9,108),(10,109)]
12:26:11 <pediddle> zip and zipWith only make an infinite list if both source lists are infinite
12:28:07 <mwc> hmm, so I'd have to do: zupWith ptDiff vs (head cycle vs)
12:28:50 <mwc> seems to me that since I don't need a circular list so that seems like more overhead
12:29:10 <basti_> i wouldnt know why a circular list should be useful in vector contexts
12:29:14 <pediddle> no overhead, that's the beauty of lazyness
12:30:02 <mwc> pediddle: good point
12:31:07 <pesco> basti_: Lists represent the vector space of sequences (identifying finite lists with xs++repeat 0). You could have a circular sequence.
12:32:32 <basti_> hmm
12:32:53 <basti_> if you say so, it probably makes sense in some context
12:33:20 <pesco> Yeah, in some, I guess. I was going to point out I know nothing about mwc's context. ;)
12:33:52 <mwc> pesco: evaluating the convexity of an arbitrary polygon
12:34:05 <pesco> Er...
12:34:16 <mwc> you need to do a dot product operation on each pair of edge vectors going around the shape
12:34:28 <mwc> and then compare the sign
12:35:11 <pesco> Ah, I see. I read german "polynom" there at first. I'm tired.
12:35:32 <sylvan> so zipWith dot edgeVectors (tail edgeVectors)
12:35:49 <mwc> that drops off the last element
12:35:56 <sylvan> so treat it specially
12:35:57 <mwc> and so you don't do a complete traversal
12:36:01 <mwc> don't worry, I got it
12:36:21 <mwc> cyclic list has more lazy goodness, it seems
12:38:25 <mwc> @plugs zipWith (+) [1..10] (head cycle [1..10])
12:38:27 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `[t -> [b]]' against `[a] -> [a]'
12:38:43 <mwc> @plugs zipWith (+) [1..10] (cycle head [1..10])
12:38:44 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `[a]' against `t -> t1'
12:39:03 <mwc> shapr: what have you done?!
12:39:20 <basti_> uhm
12:39:24 <pesco> @plugs zipWith (+) [1..10] (tail (cycle [1..10]))
12:39:25 <lambdabot> [3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,11]
12:39:28 <basti_> yes.
12:39:43 <mwc> oh, wow, that's embarrassing
12:39:43 <mwc> hahahah
12:39:48 <pediddle> "head"?
12:40:02 <mwc> Yeah, stroke
12:40:17 <pediddle> should you see a doctor?
12:40:27 <pediddle> my grandma once had a stroke...
12:40:28 <pediddle> :)
12:40:33 <pesco> Get "fixed in the HEAD".
12:40:46 <mwc> i blame the fact that I have The Core on for background noise
12:40:56 <gzl> @plugs cycle [1..10]
12:40:57 <lambdabot> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,

12:41:36 <gzl> ah well.

12:57:12 <lambdabot> I saw boegel leaving #haskell 6 hours, 6 minutes and 40 seconds
12:57:12 <lambdabot> ago.
12:57:19 <wagle> shapr: yeah
12:57:34 <shapr> I was going to ask about something you wrote, but I forget exactly what.
12:57:59 <basti_> ohh we got a new sober variant
12:58:13 <wagle> does rememory commute?
12:58:15 <basti_> uhm
12:58:25 <basti_> obliq seems... bizarre
12:59:12 <pesco> Wow, the talking eggs look cool!
12:59:30 <wagle> yeah, i love Stolfi's drawing
12:59:30 <basti_> yes
13:03:04 <shapr> wagle: have you tried to use Knit to automatically find buffer overflows?
13:03:05 <wagle> ahh..  gwydiondylan..  now thats a name i havent heard in ten years..
13:03:52 <wagle> shapr: not heard of Knit..  been trying to retool myself away from sewage processing
13:04:05 <wagle> (ie, making C safe)
13:04:07 <shapr> Sewage can be very profitable.
13:04:42 <wagle> perhaps, but you always stink of C when you go home
13:04:55 <wilx> Umm, could anybody try to type some non-ASCII stuff? Testin UTF-8 capability.
13:05:04 <wilx> Please.
13:05:14 <shapr> häy thär
13:05:15 <jadrian> 
13:05:21 <basti_> øöäüß
13:05:24 <wagle> shapr: url
13:05:24 <wilx> Thanks :)
13:05:25 <jadrian> opss I'm not using UTF-8 though I think
13:05:25 <pesco> gwäwäh
13:05:27 <wilx> Seems to work :)
13:05:30 <wagle> shapr: url?
13:05:43 <pesco> πανσενσαξκ
13:05:48 <wilx> Whoa, Greek?!
13:06:09 <shapr> @google knit haskell c
13:06:11 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/practice.html
13:06:58 <wagle> 尾はよおございます
13:07:39 <shapr> Ain't that purty? --> http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Pugs/Cont/
13:08:08 <wagle> shapr: whats the url for knit?
13:08:26 <pesco> ‘“”’≪≫≤≥ ∀∧∨∑∏∂∞⇒⇔∫
13:08:33 <wilx> Hmm, dunno that one kanji. ohayou gozaimasu?
13:08:56 <shapr> wagle: It's on http://www.haskell.org/practice.html :-) --> http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/alchemy/
13:08:56 <wilx> (hmm, never seen ohayou with kaji though)
13:11:32 <Baughn> That's not UTF-8, is it?
13:12:17 <wilx> (also I wouldn't write ohayou with o...)
13:14:50 <Oejet> wilx: Я хочу молоко.
13:15:03 <wilx> Russian? :)
13:15:10 <Oejet> wilx: Yes.
13:15:12 <wilx> Dunno what it says though.
13:15:25 <Oejet> "I want milk".
13:15:30 <wilx> Hehe.
13:15:37 <mwc> Sigh, it always rains when I barbeque
13:15:50 * Oejet is trying to look tough.
13:17:03 <wagle> Knit did sound kinda fluxish
13:19:32 <Baughn_> สวัสดีครับ, สวัสดีค่ะ
13:20:13 <Baughn_> I suppose that settles that. Irssi must die.
13:20:24 <wilx> Huhu, is that hmm...Devanagari?
13:20:29 <Baughn_> Thai
13:20:31 <wilx> Ah.
13:21:17 <wagle> i typed "ohayoo" into my macosx kotoeri mode widget. it was all hiragana until i hit space, then it changed the o into kanji.
13:21:22 <Baughn_> Γειά σας?
13:21:59 <wilx> Well, I think you shouldn't write the last o and use u instead :)
13:22:23 * mwc uses irssi, some of those symbols were thai
13:22:36 <mwc> others were inverse colors T, D, Z, and H
13:22:47 <wagle> shapr: its in my queue..  any urgency?  might take me 1-2 weeks to get to poking harder at figuring it out..  sounds interesting, though, though the PI's are OS people, not PL
13:23:40 <shapr> wagle: What's in your queue? Knit?
13:23:48 <Baughn> I think irssi just passes it through to xterm, so... hmm, that's checkable.
13:24:06 <wagle> お早う
13:24:27 <Baughn_> ሠላም�����������Eĥoŝanĝo ĉiuĵaŭde�����, ������ �ສະບາຍດີ, ຂໍໃຫ້ໂຊກດີЗдравствуйте!
13:24:40 <Maddas> Irssi's term_type setting might be relevant
13:24:50 <shapr> wagle: Knit was written by Alistair Reid
13:24:55 <wagle> ohayou gives me a menu of kanji alternatives
13:25:03 <Baughn> I'll check that. It's wrapping these lines based on byte count, not character count.
13:25:05 <wagle> shapr: yeah, Knit
13:25:25 <wagle> I'm trying to maintain a job queue (and not a stack) these days
13:25:43 <wilx> Mmm, ok, since we are off topic already...what should I install to be able to use X/Gnome with Japanese? I need some nice IME, like Windows has...
13:25:43 <mwc> heh, good one wagle
13:30:08 <rtega> strange
13:30:16 <pipe> indeed
13:31:40 <wagle> my japanese text always romanized it as ohayoo
13:31:56 <wagle> hence my confusion
13:32:00 <pipe> TFK: hey
13:32:21 <TFK> pipe, hello... sorry, have we met before?
13:32:45 <pipe> TFK: sort of, maybe i had a different nick... you know rony superstar?
13:33:05 <Oejet> pipe: Привиет.
13:33:17 <TFK> Oejet, привет :-)
13:33:25 <pipe> Oejet: what charset is that?
13:33:30 <TFK> pipe, not in the biblical sense...
13:33:32 <TFK> UTF-8
13:33:44 <pipe> hm... don't have utf-8 support here
13:33:53 <TFK> You weren't known as lightstep in your previous incarnation, were you?
13:34:09 <pipe> nope
13:34:19 <pipe> you know lightstep though?
13:34:21 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: previet!
13:34:31 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: So how do you type in russian on IRC?
13:34:33 <TFK> There's only one 'e' in the second syllable ;_;
13:34:34 <Oejet> Тфк, исвини, "привет".
13:34:51 <pipe> Oejet: what language is that?
13:34:54 <TFK> "извини" :-P
13:35:00 <Oejet> Doh.
13:35:01 <TFK> pipe, Russian
13:35:17 <pipe> ok
13:35:30 <pipe> anyway, i saw rony superstar at the base today
13:35:33 <mwc> can't everybody just speak american?
13:36:03 <xyzp> Which dialect?
13:36:17 <TFK> Sure dude, just as soon as I pay my taxes to Dubya.
13:36:17 <SyntaxNinja> mwc: niet ya hocho govoret po roosky yazeek!
13:36:52 <TFK> pipe, does she pass as an intelligent human being?
13:36:53 <Oejet> SyntaxNinja: I have made this nice variant of a phonetic Russian keyboard layout.  My typing speed is almost native.
13:37:19 <mwc> xyzp: I reckin' them four-ren-ners oughta speak good'ole 'take-sas' anglish/
13:37:23 <Heffalump> am I right that uploading Debian packages to unstable if they have no version in testing can't cause any problems for the freeze?
13:37:31 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: cool. do you mean that it's for typing with the russian charset?
13:37:40 <mwc> at least that's how is sounds to me as a Canadian :P
13:37:45 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: not quite :)
13:37:55 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: they can make more work for the autobuilders
13:38:03 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: adn they'd need to be tagged in such a way that they won't go into testing
13:38:16 <xyzp> That's pretty much how it sounds to me.
13:38:16 <Heffalump> I thought nothing was going into testing automatically.
13:38:29 <xyzp> But then I do share a border Canada.
13:38:31 <Heffalump> autobuilder work is a good point.
13:38:35 <xyzp> Perhaps it's contagious.
13:38:49 <mwc> Speaking american is actually reallise easy. First you make all your open vowels twice as long
13:39:07 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: are you making fun of me for not reading my email for an hour?
13:39:11 <xyzp> Reckon.
13:39:12 <Oejet> SyntaxNinja: Yes, I can change keyboard layout by pressing a button.
13:39:18 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: nice
13:39:25 <mwc> and then you just want to overstress A's in particular
13:39:42 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: no, because I thought that was already the case before that email :-)
13:39:46 <mwc> or should I say: "Paar-tic-ku-laar"
13:40:09 <mwc> Or you can just speak taht clam'chowder dialect Kerry does.
13:40:16 <mwc> That accent drives me up the fucking wall
13:40:29 <xyzp> Hmm.
13:41:18 <mwc> I would have voted bush just because i couldn't stand to hear Kerry on CNN every night
13:41:34 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: well, it's true now :)
13:41:40 <Oejet> How does one go about making returning a lazy string in the IO monad.
13:41:40 <SyntaxNinja> but I'm not sure about the autobuilders, lemmy ask
13:41:47 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: I think it's free & clear now
13:41:54 <Oejet> mwc: Why would Kerry speak on CNN every night?
13:42:17 <xyzp> Fox News would pay him to.
13:42:17 <mwc> Oejet: they have clips of the president everytime he turns a corner
13:42:21 <Heffalump> YM the sarge autobuilders are separate from the unstable ones?
13:42:26 <KrispyKringle> Oejet: because he wouldn't spend half his term on vacation like Bush? :P
13:42:57 <KrispyKringle> "Yeah, uh, Ah'm just, ya know, takin' a break here to cut some wood on mah ranch like, see?"
13:43:03 <xyzp> Kerry's accent is pretty mild by Massachusetts standards.
13:43:05 <KrispyKringle> Damn fake southern accent.
13:43:11 <mwc> KrispyKringle: I think that's an invalid criticism. Nowadays, a president can be plugged into his network of advisors from anywhere
13:43:13 <xyzp> He just speaks rather monotonely.
13:43:26 <KrispyKringle> mwc: OK. I'll just criticize him for being stupid instead. :P
13:43:27 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: I'm not sure
13:43:48 <mwc> KrispyKringle: or you can just let Laura Bush make fun of him
13:44:00 <KrispyKringle> And, honestly, he has advisors like "Condi" Rice. He'd be better to unplug from them once in a hwile!
13:44:02 <mwc> xyzp: really? It's a pretty thick accent to me.
13:44:10 <KrispyKringle> mwc: did you see the Daily Show last night? :P
13:44:17 <xyzp> You should spend more time with people from Boston ;)
13:44:20 <mwc> Kennedy's was worse, old clips of him are insufferable
13:44:25 <mwc> KrispyKringle: no, I read about it in the paper
13:44:37 <KrispyKringle> You read about how they accused Bush of sucking horse dick?
13:44:39 <KrispyKringle> That was in a paper?
13:44:42 <KrispyKringle> hahahaha
13:44:44 <KrispyKringle> What newspaper?
13:44:50 <mwc> xyzp: please now. I'm from Saskatchewan, I sound more like somedoy from Montana or Dakota
13:45:06 <mwc> KrispyKringle: the National Post, the right wing national
13:45:09 <KrispyKringle> (And then they had Zell Miller on to talk about decency, and the lack of it on TV!)
13:45:13 <KrispyKringle> Ah. Hahaha.
13:45:20 <KrispyKringle> It was a hilarious juxtaposition.
13:45:27 <xyzp> Zell Miller made my head hurt.
13:45:49 <mwc> "He's learned a lot about ranching since that first year when he tried to milk a horse... it was a male horse."
13:45:54 <mwc> I think that just counts as a handjob ;P
13:46:27 <xyzp> Ah, but that doesn't include the second horse from the infamous tape.
13:46:30 <mwc> "His solution to any problem on the ranch is to cut it down witha  chainsaw. I think that's why he and Cheney and Rumsfeld get along so well."
13:47:10 <KrispyKringle> haha
13:47:11 * malcolm knows nothing about merkin politics
13:47:33 <xyzp> You'd fit right in.
13:47:41 <mwc> malcolm: bush was telling a typical politician joke which was bombing, so his wife got up and did her Leno act
13:47:57 <xyzp> Eh, it was an act.
13:48:21 <mwc> it was still funny
13:48:31 <xyzp> They tried too hard.
13:48:54 <SyntaxNinja> I think we should play a prank on the debian release team and say that we _need_ to get ghc 6.4 into sarge
13:49:12 <SyntaxNinja> now that it's frozen, and the autobuilders relationship to GHC can be best described as "a losing battle" ;)
13:49:14 <mwc> "People thing Barbara bush is some sweet old Aunt Bea type. She's reallly the Don Corleone of the family."
13:49:22 <SyntaxNinja> (as in, they try to never finish building it, but they always lose)
13:49:25 <mwc> SyntaxNinja: hahahah, that would be ultimate goodness
13:49:50 <Baughn> SyntaxNinja: Slowing down Debian releases? Suddenly it all makes sense.
13:49:56 <mwc> then she said something about a contest, with "First prize is 3 nights with the Bushes. Second price is 10 nights."
13:50:11 <mwc> Baughn: Ideally, we can keep sending patches up
13:50:35 <mwc> SyntaxNinja: we tell them that 6.2.1 has serious bugs but we can't backport the fixes
13:50:48 <xyzp> All behold the self-deprecation of our venerable aristocracy.
13:51:02 <metaperl_> lol@xyzp
13:51:12 <SyntaxNinja> oh no, shh, wli is here
13:52:18 <xyzp> Maybe for their next act they can take responsibility for some of their mistakes. ;)
13:54:41 <Oejet> TFK: What is the url for your paste page?
13:54:49 <TFK> hbin.dyndns.org
13:58:31 <Oejet> http://tfk.is-a-geek.org/pastebin/25.html
14:02:06 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: 163 :) lambdabot should announce new high-water marks :)
14:02:54 <TFK> I still can't figure out why it changes the dyndns adress after posting.
14:03:11 <TFK> I'm pretty sure I recompiled it to redirect to the proper adress.
14:05:09 * Oejet looks around and realizes that no one is looking at his paste.
14:06:36 <pipe> this is pretty sweet if you are into this kind of shit: http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/
14:07:35 <gzl> that sounds silly.
14:08:17 <malcolm> Oejet: You may need to put the actual I/O (putStr) inside the iteration.
14:08:31 <mwc> We've already agreed to have  #physics reunion there
14:08:52 <malcolm> Oejet: You definitely need to hSetBuffering NoBuffering
14:14:03 <pipe> how can i test if an american electric appliance is compatible with european power with out plugging it in and hoping it doesn't melt?
14:14:44 <mwc> I take a multimeter when I leave the continent
14:14:57 <malcolm> Look for a power rating written on the appliance
14:15:22 * basti_ nods
14:15:30 <malcolm> 110-230v ~50-60Hz
14:15:32 <basti_> i think us has 110 V hasnt it?
14:15:38 <mwc> Isn't the UK grid 50 Hz?
14:15:46 <mwc> basti_: yep, 117 RMS
14:15:48 <basti_> germany is 230v, 50 hz
14:16:07 <basti_> shavers etc. sometimes work with both voltages
14:16:16 <mwc> 234 RMS is done with three-phase
14:16:19 <pipe> it says, "INPUT: AC100V 50/60Hz 7VA
14:16:24 <mwc> basti_: yep, switchin' powersupploes
14:16:29 <mwc> pipe: hehehe, where are you?
14:16:36 <basti_> computers have a switch.
14:16:40 <pipe> mwc: i am in israel
14:16:52 <basti_> putting that switch in the wrong position can kill your power supply
14:16:53 <malcolm> So it can do the frequency, but not the higher voltage.
14:17:35 <mwc> pipe: can you find an appliance (TV, Stereo) that's plugged in?
14:17:36 <basti_> UK power grid is a difficult issue i heard
14:18:45 <pipe> power here is 220v, 50hz
14:21:23 <df_> powergrids anywhere are
14:22:12 <mwc> pipe: then I wouldn't do it
14:22:32 <mwc> push come to shove, make a 2:1 winding transformer
14:24:29 <mwc> That will get you 110V, 50Hz, and a pi/2 phase shift :P
14:25:18 <pipe> i need 220V
14:25:26 <pipe> er
14:25:29 <pipe> right
14:25:48 <pipe> how do i make a 2:1 winding transformer? :)
14:25:57 <basti_> uhm
14:26:02 <basti_> wind two coils
14:26:05 <Oejet> malcolm: Adding hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering alone didn't really help, and nothing was writen to the terminal.
14:26:13 <basti_> one must have the double number of windings of the other :)
14:26:17 <mwc> pipe: for a low freq, you need a steel or iron core
14:26:28 <df_> if you dont know how to, you can purchase travel transformers.  it is the safer option
14:26:29 * basti_ nods
14:26:47 <mwc> and then you put about 200 windings around it, put that across the power supply (220V)
14:26:57 <pipe> thing is, i'm gonna need this homemade transformer to be authorized by the electrician dude at the base :)
14:27:01 <mwc> then you put 100 windings around the core, and that's your 11OV output
14:27:06 <mwc> Ah
14:27:16 <mwc> hahaha, you'd better buy it then :P
14:27:17 <basti_> buy one then ;)
14:27:26 <df_> pipe :: you can buy then at places like airports, etc.,
14:27:32 <norpan> what kind of appliance is it?
14:27:41 <pipe> it'a a gameboy ac adapter
14:27:50 <basti_> :-O
14:27:53 <basti_> critical!
14:28:00 <Oejet> malcolm: And the point is I don't want to print inside "iter", I want it to return a string.
14:28:01 <df_> just make sure it actually transforms, not a plug adapter
14:28:01 <pipe> indeed, i'm gonna be stuck at the base for 3 weeks
14:28:05 <mwc> Hmm, I wonder if the internal transformer has a tab...
14:28:22 <basti_> a transformer will be recognizeable by its high weight
14:28:30 <mwc> if the primary coil was centertapped, then a 220V would just require soldering to a different contact
14:28:47 <mwc> which would be how I'd design it for manufacturing generalization
14:28:59 <basti_> indeed, many transformers have several taps
14:29:27 <norpan> i have a generic transformer that can output any voltage, very handy
14:29:44 <norpan> with about 15 or so different plugs
14:30:28 <PerlJam> norpan: you have a transformer with a dial?  I hope when you set it you can lock it :-)
14:30:43 <mwc> basti_: I think acoustic transformers are the new hotness now
14:30:47 <mwc> magnetics are so 1950s.
14:31:05 <malcolm> Oejet: concurrency is tricky.
14:31:09 <mugwump> also very useful for hand-tuning speaker cross-overs
14:31:11 <norpan> PerlJam: it's a dial, yes
14:31:25 <norpan> you just turn it until you get the right voltage
14:31:39 <mwc> mugwump: ah, no, I mean transformers that operate with acoustic coupling
14:31:45 <mwc> as opposed to magnetic coupling
14:32:23 <malcolm> Oejet: my feeling is that the generation of data and its printing need to be in separate threads.
14:32:33 <mugwump> oh.  I was talking about using a single transformer with multiple taps as the inductor in a simultaneous high/low pass filter..
14:33:05 <Oejet> malcolm: Ah, threadDelay is only in there to slow things down.  Only one thread!  Sorry to make confussion.
14:33:32 <mwc> mugwump: you seem to be a techy...
14:33:54 <Oejet> malcolm: "iter" is the generation of data, and it needs to be lazy.
14:34:39 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: w00
14:34:44 <mwc> piezotransformers operate using an input frequency at the resonant frequency of the chunk, and then you can pick up the output at any voltage, since the voltage is proportional to the length of the segment you "tap'
14:35:04 <mwc> 1000:1 step up can be done pretty efficiently
14:35:08 * shapr would suggest WindT
14:35:09 <Oejet> It has to with the Bzip2 binding, which works by deflating into the same buffer many times.
14:36:01 <malcolm> Oejet: Remove the threadDelay, and I think it is lazy.
14:37:43 <mugwump> wow, interesting.. have you come across any spec sheets for these transformers, mwc ?
14:38:09 <mugwump> ah, it's ok, found one
14:38:20 <malcolm> Oejet: No, hold on - iter must be in the I/O monad, so the recursive call to iter happens before the final return of the string.
14:38:36 <Oejet> malcolm: Hm, it seems not so.  With (iter 1000000000000) it takes quite a while to print something.
14:38:52 <shapr> mwc: btw, would you happen to know if it's possible to build my own piezo speakers?
14:40:11 <Oejet> This is the code I'm running: http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/26.html
14:40:42 <mwc> shapr: it can be done, but they're very frequency specific. I assume you mean piezo buzzers.
14:41:14 <mugwump> aha, they work on a very high frequency it seems .. these need a 54kHz input
14:41:14 <shapr> If I wrote my own software in Haskell for testing duck typing, would it be called QuackCheck?
14:41:38 <mugwump> electrostats?
14:41:39 <shapr> mwc: Nah, full featured piezo speakers that use constructive interference.
14:42:20 <mwc> of course if you drive them with AC it could be done: take a bar of Quartz or PZT, slam about 15000 Volts at audio frequency, and then attach it to a standard speaker cone
14:42:58 <shapr> http://www.prisonplanet.com/audios_the_next_big_thing.html
14:43:07 <mwc> mugwump: yeah, and they loose effeciency FAST as you move off that freq
14:44:12 <mwc> shapr: are you talking a phased array of piezos taht you use to create a beat frequency at the desired freq?
14:44:18 <mwc> That would be pretty neat, actually
14:44:44 <astrolabe> Does it use the non-linear response of the ear?
14:45:46 <shapr> mwc: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperSonic_Sound
14:45:54 <mwc> astrolabe: no, I think it would use a beat frequency
14:46:23 <mwc> shapr: I firmly believe it's possible to build anything yourself, given enough tool supply
14:46:33 <astrolabe> Hmm but beat frequency or not, if the ear filters out high frequencies...
14:46:45 <shapr> Yeah, but the neighbors might not like my experiments.
14:47:11 <mwc> Woah, CosmicRay has IPv6? I want IPv6 :(
14:47:21 <astrolabe> Have you heard about those low frequencies which make people think a place is haunted?  :)
14:47:25 <SyntaxNinja> mwc: no, there's not enough ipv6 for everyone.
14:47:44 <shapr> mwc: http://changelog.complete.org/node/61
14:47:50 <mwc> astrolabe: heh, actually, yeah, they produce all sorts of wierd nerve effects.
14:47:54 <shapr> astrolabe: Yeah, those are nifty.
14:48:22 <mwc> astrolabe: I believe there's also a god helmet, it uses magnetic fields in the brain to produce an altered state
14:48:38 <astrolabe> Cool.  I want one.
14:48:43 <shapr> Some have been found that just amplify emotional effects. They've been used to explain why certain parts of music sound so awesome on real pipe organs.
14:49:08 <shapr> Makes me wonder if that's the real benefit of fireworks.
14:49:11 <mwc> astrolabe: http://www.geocities.com/satanicus_2/GodHelmet.html
14:49:30 <shapr> It also finally makes a decent explanation for the speaker worship practices I've seen.
14:50:12 <mwc> shapr: heh
14:51:26 <mwc> shapr: I looked at that but my WAP isn't IPv6 ready
14:51:35 <mwc> well, the router portion of it isn't
14:51:40 <shapr> The use of "peaks my interest" makes me want to strangle people.
14:51:51 <shapr> The correct verb is PIQUE.
14:52:23 <shapr> Happily no one here has said "peaks my interest".
14:52:29 <shapr> Except me.
14:52:32 * shapr strangles himself
14:52:33 <mwc> well, my interest did "peak" when it was piqued
14:52:34 <pipe> this thing says, "OUTPUT: DC5.2V 320mA", can i go to an electronics store an ask for an ac adapter with this output and they might have one?
14:53:00 <mwc> yeah, you need a variable voltage power supply
14:53:01 <shapr> pipe: That's often easiest, get a multiwart.
14:53:18 <mwc> if you get a 110V->2.6V it will do 220V->5.2 :P
14:53:33 <pipe> really?
14:53:38 <mwc> yeah
14:53:44 <shapr> When I was importing my electronics from the USA I bought a few multiwarts and was able to immediately use everything.
14:53:52 <mwc> Transformers wdo ratioes
14:53:56 <mwc> *ratios
14:54:00 <pipe> a variable voltage has like a dial or something?
14:54:04 <Heffalump> mwc: if it doesn't fry itself.
14:54:24 <Heffalump> and if there's negligible capacitance or resistance inside
14:54:33 <shapr> pipe: Usually a slider switch.
14:54:39 <Heffalump> and if the AC is at the same frequency
14:55:18 <mwc> Heffalump: it is
14:55:37 <df_> do be careful however, variable transformers are not isolating
14:55:42 <Heffalump> I was just stating all the caveats :-)
14:55:53 <Heffalump> the one about frying is most important
14:56:00 <mwc> Heffalump: we call people like you "mom"
14:56:45 <Heffalump> mwc: I call people who would just assume it would work "morons" :-p
14:56:45 <mwc> "Wash behind your ears. Eat your vegetables. Make sure you only use properly rated electronics devices."
14:56:58 <mwc> Heffalump: or physicists :P
14:57:03 <pipe> but how will i plug the device into the multiwart?
14:57:21 <shapr> Multiwarts have four or more output plugs.
14:57:22 <mwc> pipe: they usually have about 20 different swappable plugs
14:57:31 <shapr> The swappables are best.
14:57:37 <shapr> What's the real name of multiwarts?
14:57:43 <shapr> something power supply, right?
14:57:49 <Heffalump> mwc: also, since he seems to need DC input, your suggestion is completely unhelpful
14:57:52 <mwc> Universal? Switching?
14:57:52 <pipe> i need to plug a gameboy advance sp into it
14:58:04 <mwc> Heffalump: ah, right, forgot about that
14:58:06 <Heffalump> since any transformer+stuff that produces DC output won't scale up the output with input voltage.
14:58:21 <mwc> Heffalump: I was thinking we were still on the 220 -> 110 VAC thing
15:01:40 <shapr> Does anyone else here call them wallwarts?
15:02:45 <mwc> shapr: never heard the term
15:02:56 <mwc> I call them "powerbricks"
15:03:11 <pediddle> shapr: yes
15:04:32 <Lemmih> Problem: alexj has too many ideas and not enough mojo to realize them. Proposal: Give him the GHC source and let him go nuts.
15:04:38 <shapr> wow, cool - http://acidzebra.blogspot.com/2004/07/presenting-juicebox-v10.html
15:04:53 <shapr> or "One wallwart to rule them all."
15:04:54 <mwc> The best one i've heard is "holes." As in, this girl I was with was looking around the library for holes for her laptop
15:05:01 * shapr laughs
15:05:28 <shapr> pediddle: Did you learn that term in the southeast of the USA? That's where I heard it, just curious about the etymology.
15:07:36 * Igloo has heard the term in the UK
15:10:41 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: well, his proposal might make some things in Cabal easlier :)
15:10:44 <SyntaxNinja> easier
15:11:23 <SyntaxNinja> eh, probably not actually
15:11:36 <SyntaxNinja> but maybe cabal would be different if we had that from the start
15:11:51 <SyntaxNinja> i'm sure JaffaCake and malcolm are going to get right on that
15:12:06 <Lemmih> Open Module Resolution?
15:12:41 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: some kind of hook into the compiler for that kinda thing could be useful, but just to cabal and whatever alex is doing, probably
15:13:18 <SyntaxNinja> so instead of constructing -package flags on the command line, we'd just provide the resolver
15:13:45 <SyntaxNinja> but I was kidding about it being implemented right away.
15:14:09 <shapr> I would prefer to have Python-style relative module names. If there is a plug-in resolver I'll definitely hack that up for my own use.
15:14:46 * Lemmih is vary about any changes that would require updates to all implementations.
15:16:24 <SyntaxNinja> wary?
15:16:31 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: yeah.
15:16:35 <Lemmih> Especially when the entire proposal is less than 20 lines long.
15:17:22 <SyntaxNinja> in general GHC is exposing more and more of its internals, which is kinda cool.
15:17:46 <SyntaxNinja> JaffaCake: alive?
15:17:59 <Heffalump> shapr: relative module names in declarations, imports, or both?
15:18:26 <Heffalump> and in either case, how do you work out what the absolute name is when compiling?
15:18:27 <Lemmih> Alexj would probably be taken serious if he made proposals as detailed as SPJ.
15:18:43 <SyntaxNinja> maybe alex thinks that there's a Haskell cabal (little c) that these proposals are meant to be addressed to, like who is going to do all these things that he's always proposing?
15:19:05 <SyntaxNinja> JaffaCake:  why does SPJ hyphenate his name in his email?
15:19:39 <SyntaxNinja> usually when people write proposals for stuff to do, that means "I'm going to do this unless someone stops me" :)
15:19:43 * Lemmih goes goes back to his dev box.
15:19:59 <shapr> Each included directory would be a possible 'root'. By default, 'here' would be the root. If you had a subdir with a specially named file, something like Module.hs, then it would be considered a submodule.
15:20:20 <shapr> So if I had Foo/Module.hs and Foo/Bar.hs I could import Foo.Bar to get Bar.hs
15:20:38 <shapr> That would be a direct port of Python-style imports.
15:21:28 <Heffalump> I don't follow that.
15:22:02 <shapr> Python has here/foo/__init__.py and here/foo/bar.py. If you're in here, you can import foo.bar
15:23:04 <shapr> Python doesn't declare module names, so "import bar" works just fine if it's the same dir, and "import foo.bar" works if you have foo/bar.py and foo/__init__.py
15:23:07 <Heffalump> ok, and what name gets compiled into the object file for each thing?
15:23:39 <shapr> I'd use it as it was imported.
15:25:09 <shapr> On the other hand, a pluggable import mechanism is a) a bike shed and b) recipe for disaster
15:25:30 <shapr> Just my opinion, of course.
15:26:36 <Heffalump> 'use it as it was imported' makes no sense to me
15:27:04 <blackdog> shapr: a bike shed?
15:27:05 <shapr> If you imported function Foo.Bar.baz, that's the name I'd put in the object file.
15:27:21 <Heffalump> in the importing module or the imported module?
15:27:30 <theorb> [google://jargon file bikeshed]
15:27:41 <shapr> @jargon "bike shed"

15:30:45 <SyntaxNinja> @jargon bike-shed
15:30:47 <lambdabot> No match for "bike-shed".
15:31:13 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: I just don't think people _want_ such fine-grained control over module imports
15:31:23 <SyntaxNinja> at least your average haskell hacker.
15:31:49 <shapr> Here's the canonical bike-shed email - http://www.celabo.org/freebsd/phk2.txt
15:31:51 <SyntaxNinja> I mean, how often are you sitting there thinking, "boy, i'd like to try this other version of the same interface to see how that works"
15:31:57 <shapr> Um, never.
15:32:13 <shapr> I think the whole discussion is a bike shed for that matter.
15:32:32 <shapr> Someone encase alexj in carbonite please so I can get more cool source code, yeah?
15:32:46 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: but it's a little different. if he wanted to build a bike shed, that would be one thing. we'd have a lively debate and it would get built eventually
15:33:07 <SyntaxNinja> but he wants someone else to build a free-standing bike suspension device or something
15:33:44 <shapr> But worse than that, he wants to talk about it for megabytes on end.
15:34:20 <shapr> I would say "go forth and write it, so that we can look at it." and then if it's really something great, integrate it. If it's not so great, flush it.
15:34:28 <shapr> He obviously cares enough about it that he should write it.
15:34:48 <shapr> Much like the Linux kernel, if someone has a great idea, they should have a great patch.
15:34:49 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: I think he needs someone to explain to him that free software gets built by the people who either have the itch, or think it's Cool.
15:35:17 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: if he had  an idea that captured the fire of a Simon, then it might happen, or he could do it himself.
15:35:30 <shapr> He can still do it himself.
15:35:45 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: but he keeps sorta making these proposals for someone else to do that folks aren't apparently interested in doing
15:35:53 <SyntaxNinja> I should just speak for myself
15:35:54 <shapr> Now isn't that shocking.
15:36:18 <shapr> Yeah, whenever someone propose that I do something I get suspicious.
15:36:45 <SyntaxNinja> heh
15:37:09 <SyntaxNinja> though I guess if he were to convince me that one of the things I really cared about were wrong, I'd fix it, even if i weren't that excited about it.
15:37:16 <SyntaxNinja> wasn't that excited
15:37:45 <shapr> Why hasn't he already written the code for his proposals and submitted it?
15:38:20 <SyntaxNinja> well, they need a broad consensus to work.
15:38:57 <SyntaxNinja> just like cabal did... I tried to Just Do It, but no one would buy in until I went to meet Simon, Simon, Ross, and Malcolm
15:39:03 <shapr> Hm, good point.
15:39:15 <SyntaxNinja> there were like 2 or 3 prototypes
15:39:44 <theorb> There is a danger to not getting it right the first time.
15:40:14 <shapr> But, in the case where he hasn't been able to convince anyone that his ideas are interesting, shouldn't he then write a patch that others can try out for themselves?
15:40:32 <shapr> In OSS, code is sometimes the best communication.
15:40:41 <theorb> People write code against your initial spec, and you find when you change the spec, that you either have to break them, or you have to constrain yourself by staying compatable with them.
15:41:03 <theorb> This is not, however, a call for analisis paralisis.
15:41:16 <theorb> The best way to prove something is possible is to do it.
15:41:54 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: it's not so much about breaking a spec. haskellers can deal with that :)
15:42:20 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: the problem is that the proposals would take work from 4 or 5 compiler authors and maybe some work on the cabal
15:42:29 <SyntaxNinja> to alter their own systems to work
15:42:56 * theorb was trying to talk in general terms...
15:43:08 <theorb> ...because I don't really know what the proposal being discussed is.
15:43:25 <theorb> (And have a vauge understanding that Cabal is kind of like apt for haskell modules.)
15:44:14 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: cabal is more like debuild or something; it holds metadata and provides a standard interface for building and installing tools
15:44:29 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: maybe kinda like dpkg; cabal-get is like apt, hackageDB is like an apt-source
15:44:34 * SyntaxNinja feels like he will be explaining this a lot
15:44:45 <theorb> Quite likely.
15:45:14 <theorb> What's your proposal, in a nutshell?
15:46:10 <reffie>  http://www.crazyshit.com/dc.php?type=medias&cid=5367&pg=index
15:47:20 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: it's not  my proposal
15:47:33 <shapr> reffie: Did your browser get infected and take over your irc client? ;-)
15:47:41 <reffie> heh no
15:47:45 <reffie> watch the video
15:47:47 <reffie> it's fucking great
15:48:45 <SyntaxNinja> reffie: I haven't looked at the link, but FWIW, you should mark random URLs as either safe for the workplace or not, and it should also be on topic
15:49:19 <shapr> The ads in that url are definitely NSFW.
15:49:21 * theorb wonders how many metaperls are needed.
15:49:29 <reffie> my bad
15:49:41 <[1]metaperl_> how many are there?
15:49:50 <shapr> And I don't have flash installed, so all I saw was the ads :-P
15:49:57 <[1]metaperl_> i wonder why hydrairc does that... I am connected at home and here too
15:50:09 <Heffalump> does the name 'hydra' give any clues?;-)
15:50:28 <blackdog> don't quit one unless you have a torch handy...
15:50:54 <metaperler> hydra - a beast out of control
15:52:25 <theorb> Cut off one head, and two more grow in it's place.
15:52:52 <Heffalump> it is?
15:53:06 <theorb> s/it's/its/
15:53:13 <blackdog> why am i not surprised that haskell hackers are grammar nazis?
15:53:29 <shapr> You missed some capitalization there.
15:53:34 * shapr cackles evilly
15:53:53 <SyntaxNinja> blackdog: what does that mean? :)
15:54:05 <mwc> http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/27.html Does this seem to be a "good" functional solution to this problem? I'm trying not to do it in a proecural way?
15:54:11 <blackdog> it's my homage to ee cummings
15:54:33 <SyntaxNinja> theorb: but cabal is www.haskell.org/cabal
15:54:50 <mwc> Essentially I need to make sure that the perpendicular dot product is the same sign for all angles in a polygon given a continuous walk of the edges in one direction
15:56:03 <Igloo> mwc: This isn't a Haskell issue, but you shouldn't be comparing floats for equality like that
15:56:25 <blackdog> mwc: and 'head ss' can fail... unless it's an infinite list in which case i'll shut up
15:56:44 <mwc> blackdog: oh, (s:ss) will match a single element list?
15:56:46 <mwc> Damn.
15:57:17 <mwc> Igloo: I need to make sure they're not of different sign. 1.0 is represented exactly, isn't it?
15:57:18 <blackdog> yeah. you need (s:s':ss) or something equally sibilant
15:57:24 <astrolabe> Not looking at the code, that sounds like a characterisation of polygons with no acute angles.
15:57:26 <theorb> Well, a single, or two-element list wouldn't represent a valid polygon.
15:57:29 <mwc> blackdog: ah, great
15:57:48 <theorb> But that's probably not a good reason to die horribly on it.
15:57:57 <astrolabe> Ah.  'perpendicular' dot product.  Sorry.
15:58:03 <mwc> astrolabe: nope, works for all acording to mathworld
15:58:24 <Igloo> Oh, with the output of signum you might be OK, I'm not sure
15:58:56 <blackdog> theorb: good point. i'm just giving meaning-agnostic suggestions here. :)
15:59:37 <Igloo> You could do it a bit more functionally with something like    all (>= 0) . zipWith (*) xs (tail xs)
16:00:27 <mwc> Igloo: ah, I'll look into All that seems to be what I was looking for!
16:00:29 <theorb> Hm, you possibly shouldn't call it sgnEq if you expect the input to already be signumed.
16:01:06 * theorb isn't really a lambda person, though.
16:01:10 <mwc> It's the function that checks to see if all the signs are equal. made sense to me :P
16:02:33 <theorb> Er, but it doesn't check if the signs are equal -- it checks if the input is all 1 or 0.
16:03:21 <theorb> I see I'm wrong about the case where head would fail being out of spec input, though.
16:03:30 <blackdog> so move signum into the case statement, mebbe?
16:04:14 <shapr> g'day stefanh
16:04:36 <stefanh> hi
16:06:26 <shapr> stefanh: Are you the Stefan formally known as Heimann?
16:06:30 <Lemmih> YES! Finally got that stupid 'latest' function right. No more HTML for me today!
16:06:33 <mwc> blackdog: http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/28.html I trust that addresses both issues?
16:07:28 <stefanh> exactly :-) Now I'm known as Wehr
16:07:54 * shapr typoed "formerly"
16:08:12 <blackdog> mwc: sure. Except why the  "True &&" ?
16:08:18 <blackdog> shapr: thinkoed, surely?
16:08:18 <mwc> theorb: that was I see it, a line segment is convex if you see it as a closed biangle
16:08:34 <mwc> blackdog: yeah, exactly
16:09:04 <shapr> blackdog: yeah, that one.
16:09:10 <mwc> I was thinking "signs equal and this case, check to see if it's in teh rest of the list"
16:09:22 <blackdog> everyone's agreeing with me. I must have done something wrong.
16:09:25 <theorb> Hmm, sgnEq (a:[]) = True, sgnEq (a:b:c) = ((signum a) == (signum b)) && sgnEq [b,c]
16:09:46 <blackdog> mwc: you don't really need the if statement
16:09:52 <shapr> stefanh: Were you part of the Thiemann/Neubauer Speed Music initiative?
16:10:07 <theorb> There's just something wrong-looking about sgnEq for me that I can't quite put my finger on.
16:10:20 <blackdog> just a condition: (various s0 conditions) && sgnEq (s1:ss)
16:10:27 <theorb> ...but like I said, I'm not really a lambdaite yet.
16:10:28 <mwc> theorb: I count zero as being the same sign as either a + or a -'ve number in this context
16:10:42 <mwc> I think that might be it
16:10:51 <blackdog> explicit True and False is generally a bad smell
16:11:15 <theorb> blackdog, even in your base case?
16:11:21 <mwc> Yeah I can't think of another way to structure this, but that may be C-bias
16:11:27 <blackdog> base case is ok.
16:11:44 <stefanh> shapr: no, I didn't even know that Matthias was involved in that
16:11:49 <blackdog> but in more complex conditions they're usually redundant
16:11:58 <mwc> How do I eliminate the if statement?
16:12:00 <mwc> I need to inject a false at some point
16:12:07 <blackdog> @paste
16:12:08 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
16:12:10 <shrimpx> can anyone point me somewhere where the "class Foo a b c | d e where ..." stuff is explained? (namely the | part)
16:12:18 <mwc> if two numbers have different signs
16:12:57 <shapr> stefanh: If you don't mind me asking, why did you change your name?
16:12:59 <theorb> You can do it by replacing my == with a function that works for the 0 case like you want it to.
16:13:36 <theorb> ...
16:13:50 <mwc> theorb: ah
16:14:00 <theorb> Which would let you get rid of the explicit signums if you like.
16:14:03 <blackdog> mwc: up on the paste board
16:14:25 <theorb> OTOH, that'd mean putting explicit trues and falses there, which doesn't help much.
16:14:55 <blackdog> too early in the morning to get rid of the redundant parens :)
16:15:22 <shapr> stefanh: Oh, because it's Thiemann and Sperber who have the speed music initiative: http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/Speed.html
16:15:25 <stefanh> shapr: I got married :-))
16:15:49 <theorb> Ah, I like your version, blackdog.
16:16:28 <shapr> stefanh: cool, congrats :-)
16:16:29 <theorb> (Parens that are redundant for the compiler may or may not be for the reader.)
16:17:01 <mwc> theorb: it's the same as yours, actually, modulo the comparison function
16:17:26 <theorb> I know.
16:17:58 <theorb> The fact that they are equivlent doesn't mean that one can't be better.
16:19:41 <blackdog> it just occurred to me how odd it is that i can make improvements in code without even knowing what it's for or how it works. i'm sure i used to know how a dot product worked, but these days i wouldn't recognise one if it accosted me in a dark alley and mugged me for my shoes.
16:21:19 <mwc> Hah
16:22:02 <theorb> Sounds more like a cross product to me.
16:22:21 <shapr> hot cross product
16:23:45 <mwc> theorb: a cross product is a vector. Asside from the fact that this is a scalar and doesn't negate under operand commutation, it's the same as teh cross product
16:24:22 <theorb> mwc: I know, I was just thinking that a cross product is more likely to mug people for their shoes then a dot product.
16:24:34 * Igloo wonders when in the month HCAR is released
16:24:40 <mwc> a^T \dot b = |a||b|sin \theta, a \times b = |a||b|\bar{n} sin \theta
16:24:45 <mwc> theorb: ah, now I g et it
16:29:42 <theorb> Hmm, jhc isn't compiling for me, and I don't see why.
16:30:06 <dons> you don't see why? no error messages?
16:30:12 <theorb> Atom.hs:22:53: Not in scope: `hashPS`.
16:30:22 <dons> that's why ;)
16:30:30 <theorb> "table = unsafePerformIO (HT.new (==) (fromIntegral . hashPS))"
16:30:51 <dons> check the logs, someone else had this problem a few days ago
16:30:59 <theorb> But it imports PackedString, which exists in the same directory, and that exports hashPS.
16:39:31 <theorb> dons, thanks for the pointer, got it.
16:39:46 <theorb> (The makefile needs a --ignore-package lang.)
16:42:10 <dons> ah ha!
16:43:13 <theorb> It's not yet finished compiling, but it's gotten much further.
16:44:11 * Igloo drowns in segfaults and again tries to resist the urge to write a nice Haskell abc to ps convertor
16:46:04 <shapr> Igloo: abc?
16:46:23 <Igloo> .sf.net; music notation
16:54:52 <mwc> Gah, idiots... hospital sent medical correspondce to my old address and it passed through the hands of people I'd rather not have seen it pass trhough
16:54:54 <mwc> this is lawsuit material, IMAO
16:55:11 <pipe> us of a?
16:55:28 <mwc> pipe: Canada, but stronger privacy laws here
16:55:46 <theorb> Much.
16:55:58 <theorb> The US doesn't have that much in the way of privacy laws.
16:56:51 <mwc> Wow, I'm furious
16:57:02 <mwc> it was just a bill for a splint
16:57:22 <mwc> but it had the name of the orthopaedic practice on the envelope that went to my estranged father
16:57:44 <mwc> So that's disclosure that I underwent a medical procedure
16:59:51 <theorb> Later, thanks for the help.
17:09:40 <mwotton> is anyone here?
17:09:46 <pipe> yo
17:10:03 <mwotton> Ah, that's good. new irc program, thought i'd borked it.
17:10:06 <Lemmih> I'm also here.
17:16:13 <timbod> new irc program - what is it? I'm not particularly satisified with xchat.
17:19:08 <blackdog> timbod: i just got the carbon version of xemacs for macos x going, so i'm seeing how much of my life i can move into it.
17:19:35 <blackdog> (I'm inspired by shapr's example, who appears to be more or less an instantiation of his init.el.)
17:19:40 <mwc> Woah, you dual boot Emacs and OS X?
17:19:40 <mwc> Cool
17:20:04 <mwc> heh
17:20:07 <blackdog> it's like juggling chainsaws
17:20:08 <gzl> haha
17:20:31 <dons> blackdog , you were supposed to quit your job and hack on yi, remember?
17:20:32 <blackdog> actually, the carbon build is ok, unless you try to move the screen or type.
17:20:41 <dons> haha
17:20:45 <gzl> what's the benefit of the carbon version over the X11 version?
17:20:48 <blackdog> dons: ha.
17:20:49 <shapr> blackdog: :-P
17:20:52 <mwc> Chainsaws have handles, I prefer to use the term "Juggle phosphorus"
17:20:55 <shapr> blackdog: anyway, I'm moving into Yi asap.
17:21:13 <blackdog> gzl: better integration with macos - it acts like a normal app instead of living in the X11 ghetto
17:21:17 * mwc bites tongue on comparison to Carbonized GVim.
17:21:29 <dons> mwc? is it good?
17:21:29 * mwc just enables antialiased font rednering and transparency and goes back to work
17:21:36 <dons> hehe cool
17:21:37 <blackdog> shapr: good idea, but i need something that works now. ;)
17:21:51 <mwc> mwc: it's very good
17:21:53 <shapr> Yeah, that's why I'm still using xemacs.
17:22:00 <dons> yeah yeah. no full time yi hackers. but we're making progress
17:22:02 <mwc> er, dons, it's very good.
17:22:22 <gzl> blackdog: does that amount to anything more significant than copy/paste/...?
17:22:24 <mwc> gz1  blackdog is right, X11 on Mac OS X is a ghetto
17:22:45 <mwc> they're not full class applications, they all live under the X11 "application"
17:22:51 <gzl> yes, i'm quite familiar. :)
17:23:06 <blackdog> dons: mac gui for yi would be a big step towards me using it. is wolfgangt working on it actively, is the design document for guis done... where are we?
17:23:12 <dons> there's been 6 contributors to yi in the past couple of weeks I think
17:23:13 <mwc> ah.
17:23:22 <gzl> i just never found those things a big deal with emacs.
17:23:22 <mwc> The nice thing about the carbonized vim is that it uses Quartz font rendering hotness
17:23:30 <gzl> oh, really? neat
17:23:38 <dons> we have a proposal. it's in my hands. wolfgang's not working on it
17:23:47 <gzl> well, what i didn't like about the carbon emacs/vim the last time I tried them was that you couldn't launch from terminal
17:23:47 <blackdog> gzl: yeah, does a bit. I use QuickSilver for switching apps, and switching to the X11 task is a bit pointless.
17:23:51 <dons> mainly, I have to adapt curses to the ui api
17:24:06 <dons> then plugging in new ui's should be easy (wolfgang sorted out the abstractions)
17:24:22 <mwc> :set guifont=monaco:h10 antialias is a big one.
17:24:34 <mwc> gzl: you can launch the Gvim from the terminal
17:24:45 * dons ponders running gvim instead of vim
17:24:54 <mwc> /Applications/Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -G
17:24:54 <mwc> so you just need to alias it
17:24:54 <blackdog> gzl: you mean the "open /Applications/Xemacs.app" thing?
17:24:57 <dons> but, then again, my terminal has antialiasing
17:25:02 <gzl> mwc: hm, cool. i'll try them out.
17:25:15 <gzl> blackdog: back in the day, you couldn't open files directly with that.
17:25:24 <mwc> gzl: yeah, you can also do: open -a Vim filename
17:25:32 <gzl> ok, I'll try these again.
17:25:34 <mwc> which is what Irecommend actually
17:26:07 <blackdog> gzl: you still might not be able to. I'm not willing to reboot xemacs to find out.:)
17:26:07 <mwc> dons: iTerm?
17:26:15 <mwc> or the stock terminal
17:26:27 <dons> I'm running ion on openbsd. so just xterm
17:26:47 <blackdog> dons has his coffee black, his programs guiless, and his curry meatless :P
17:26:55 <mwc> ah, thought you meant OS X.
17:27:01 * blackdog waits to be karma-ed
17:27:02 <mwc> Hahaha
17:27:04 <dons> hehe
17:27:13 <dons> @karma+ blackdog
17:27:14 <lambdabot> blackdog's karma has been incremented
17:27:14 <dons> ;)
17:27:31 <blackdog> contrary. That's a minus sign, y'know.
17:27:49 <mwc> I think I'm still -'ve karma for trying to hack lambdabot
17:27:54 <mwc> @sys rm -rf /
17:27:55 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
17:28:01 <blackdog> @karma mwc
17:28:03 <lambdabot> mwc has a karma of -1
17:28:06 <dons> hehe
17:28:11 <mwc> @autodestruct
17:28:12 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
17:28:15 <dons> persistence is great
17:28:22 <dons> @karma+ TheHunter
17:28:22 <lambdabot> TheHunter's karma has been incremented
17:28:24 <dons> for implementing it
17:28:25 <blackdog> mwc is coming back as a cockroach if he's lucky, and a fundamentalist if he's not.
17:28:53 <mwc> Baptists: America's Taliban.
17:29:12 <dons> blackdog, finally got some broadband into my house. it's a shiny new world :)
17:29:44 <blackdog> ever read landoverbaptist and wondered for more than a minute if they were satire or not?
17:29:48 <mwc> I'm not being reincarnated, so much as escaping into the mortal coil.
17:29:53 <shapr> mwc: Hey, I'm a Baptist.
17:30:07 <dons> @ghc
17:30:08 <lambdabot>  does not have the required strict field(s)
17:30:08 <mwc> blackdog: yep
17:30:26 <gzl> mwc: yeah, this is pretty good. with vim at least. it comes with a 'gvim' script that you can stick in the path and just type "gvim foo"
17:30:44 <mwc> yep
17:30:52 <gzl> i've gotten really used to emacs viper mode though.
17:31:01 <mwc> I recommend pscolor scheme, antialiased text
17:31:13 <mwc> Ah
17:31:38 <shapr> jaap: Do you know skew?
17:31:50 <gzl> I really don't like antialiased monaco
17:31:53 <gzl> but to each his own
17:32:14 <mwc> blackdog: someone once said I was coming back as something nasty, to whit I told her: "God sent me to test the world. I'll come back as whatever he deems fitting."
17:32:24 <mwc> gzl: try antialiased Anonymous
17:33:10 <mwc> guifont="anonymous:h9" is scarily legible, espeecially light-on-dark
17:33:35 <gzl> i like aliased monaco 9
17:33:44 <gzl> or 10
17:33:51 <shammah> gzl: do you mean aliased or anti-aliased?
17:34:28 <mwc> http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html one of the best monospaced fonts I've seen
17:34:28 <gzl> aliased.
17:34:38 <shammah> My preference is antialiased monaco 12.
17:34:38 <thebug> "lucida console" all the way :)
17:34:59 <blackdog> shapr: do you use erc?
17:35:23 <mwc> shammah: yeah, some of us still have young eyes to ruin though :P
17:35:33 <shammah> mwc :P
17:35:34 <gzl> I like aliased text for terminals, fixed width stuff, etc.
17:35:46 <gzl> unless it's something like Courier 12, then antialiasing is fine.
17:36:42 <Igloo> fg
17:37:21 <shammah> Actually I just prefer the heavier weight of the antialiased monaco vs. aliased.
17:37:52 <mwc> After just looking at anonymous 9pt, Monaco 12 looks like something written with crayon
17:38:30 <blackdog> crayon hackers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your tips
17:52:44 <blackdog> shapr: what was that local-variable emacs trick you were showing me? My google-fu is weak.
18:01:18 <mwc> foldl is more efficient on finite lists, but not usable for infinite lists?
18:04:53 <Cale> foldl is not really more efficient on finite lists, you want foldl'
18:05:08 <Cale> well, it might still be marginally better
18:05:44 <Cale> but due to laziness, it's about the same as foldr
18:05:59 <Cale> only less natural and broken for infinite lists :)
18:06:20 <mwc> Ah, yes, foldr
18:06:30 <mwc> that's what I meant
18:06:48 <mwc> foldr is more efficient because it starts at the end of the list?
18:07:05 <Cale> foldr just replaces the conses directly
18:07:46 <mwc> Hmm, so if direction doesn't matter which is preferable for a finite list?
18:08:50 <Cale> I'd almost always use foldr, unless the function wasn't going to work on infinite lists, and I didn't care about laziness, in which case, foldl' is what you want.
18:08:58 <Cale> (note the prime)
18:09:15 <Cale> foldl' is in Data.List, it's a strict version of foldl
18:09:19 <mwc> hmm, what's the lazyness issue?
18:10:26 <mwc> well, if I just need to add a list I've created with areas of segments, so it's *always* finite and every unit has to be calculated anyways
18:10:52 <Cale> well, say you do a foldl f z xs, it will generally not evaluate the function f at all, until it has processed the whole list, and produced an unevaluated expression
18:11:39 <mwc> but if I do foldr (+) 0.0 subAreas, it has to start evaluating right away?
18:11:43 <Cale> an unevaluated expression which is as large as the original list, using memory just the same way we'd hoped to avoid
18:11:58 <mwc> ah, so foldr is what I want
18:12:08 <Cale> probably you want foldl'
18:13:44 <mwc> which is strict.
18:13:46 <Cale> yes
18:13:58 <Cale> http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Haskell_List_Processing -- I did the section on folds
18:14:03 <mwc> Hmm, I don't understand strictness as well as I tohought
18:14:04 <mwc> ah
18:15:40 <mwc> Cale: ah, thanks
18:15:48 <Cale> no problem
18:35:34 <mwc> Why does GHC barf on this where in line 5 here: http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/29.html
18:37:54 <Cale> missing close paren on the previous line?
18:38:13 <mwc> Cale: I'm ashamed to say I noticed that just a half second before you pointed it out

19:08:19 <Pseudonym> Sorry, why do you think there would be type explosions?
19:08:56 <mwc> Okay, GHCI is exploding on something similar
19:09:11 <mwc> regularPolygon n s = Polygon [(polyPt i) | i <- [0..(n-1)]]
19:09:14 <mwc>     where polyPt i = (r*cos (t*i),r*sin (t*i))

19:09:14 <mwc>                     t = (n-2.0)/n*pi
19:41:15 <pediddle> maybe this is a dumb question, but how do i enter a multi-line binding (like a where clause) directly into ghci?

20:04:22 <pediddle> i learned SML in my languages class this quarter (yawn)... i was disappointed to find that most things weren't curried, and it didn't even define curry and uncurry by default
20:04:52 <lispy> SML ?
20:04:58 <pediddle> standard ML
20:05:25 <mwc> lispy: StandardML
20:05:33 <mwc> kinda like O'Caml, without the classes, I guess
20:06:15 <mwc> pediddle: is that a somewhat accurate definition? I looked at SML before settling on haskell
20:06:46 <pediddle> haskell wins hands down
20:06:50 <pediddle> IMHO
20:07:50 <pediddle> ML is very clunky, no easy lambda syntax, no easy way to partially apply an infix operator, no lazy lists...
20:07:53 <lispy> oh, i was viewing uncurry like Maple's unapply, but it's totally different.
20:08:10 <pediddle> and no type classes... god I love Haskell's classes
20:08:22 <mwc> lispy: I don't know about you, but Haskell make Maple seem sucky to me
20:08:37 <gzl> how can you compare haskell and maple?
20:08:46 <mwc> I've been meaning to get a copy of teh student version of mathematica
20:08:59 <lispy> maple has its uses
20:09:00 <pediddle> mwc: bittorrent ;)
20:09:00 <mwc> gzl: I used to use Maple for prototyping algos, among other things
20:09:06 <gzl> oh, ok
20:09:24 <mwc> pediddle: meh, student editions are too cheap to bother with BitTorrent
20:09:39 <mwc> gzl: I also find that Maple's imperative
20:09:40 <pediddle> aren't they still like $500?
20:09:43 <mwc> and I see that as old and crappy
20:09:53 <gzl> mathematica isn't?
20:10:01 <gzl> i haven't used either to code in.
20:10:03 <mwc> pediddle: more like $90 or so
20:10:08 <mwc> and have all the features
20:10:17 <mwc> gzl: I tried mathematica and have an old version of it
20:10:24 <gzl> i think it's $129 for student mathematica
20:10:37 <mwc> I couldn't get used to it because [] and () have the opposite meanings as in C
20:10:38 <lispy> i've yet to find anything that does algebra as well as maple does.  Haskell could learn to support it, but Maple really does supportit.
20:10:58 <mwc> and it was horrible awkward to go back and forht
20:11:02 <mwc> gzl: well, I got maple for free from the school
20:11:05 <pediddle> mwc: $139.95
20:11:25 <mwc> the applied math department here has half the faculty working on the internals of Maple
20:11:30 <pediddle> still pricey for me... i just paid tuition, taxes and rent :)
20:11:35 <mwc> so for students in it the profs practically have a bin of CDs in their offices
20:11:56 <mwc> pediddle: heh, good thing I can probably get it for free
20:12:04 <mwc> assuming I'd be covered by any site license in effect
20:12:20 <lispy> it's sad how few mathematicians have had a GOOD into to programming
20:12:29 <pediddle> my campus has it in all the labs
20:12:30 <gzl> mwc: waterloo?
20:12:32 <lispy> many have been taught C and hate programming there after :)
20:12:47 <mwc> I'm assuming you mean pure mathematicians
20:13:04 <lispy> mwc: for some values of pure :)
20:13:11 <mwc> most of the applied math undergrads here could code a CS undergrad under the table
20:13:32 <lispy> that's good
20:13:34 <mwc> gzl: no, University of Western Ontario.
20:13:39 <gzl> ok.
20:14:48 <mwc> @paste
20:14:49 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
20:15:46 <mwc> I think one of the big wins about haskell is the community
20:16:14 <mwc> You won't find nearly the same amount of competency per capita in #c++ or #java
20:17:23 <lispy> the reason people gravitate towards particular languages and paradigms has always interested me.  I just can't figure it out.
20:18:37 <lispy> i just saw a talk this week by Conal Elliot and I was really impressed by his haskell programs that produce beautiful, fast graphics.  And yet he said he couldn't despite his best efforts sell the ideas to the programmers at MS
20:19:14 <lispy> he said in one talk they even told him it would have to look like C for them to be interested
20:19:52 <mwc> lispy: what did it for haskell for me was the Quicksort example
20:20:04 <mwc> When I realized that I wasn't looking at code but at the actual fundamental way the algo worked
20:20:12 <mwc> I realized Haskell was new hotness
20:20:23 <lispy> yeah, that example has done it for a lot of people
20:20:33 <lispy> i didn't understand quicksort untill i saw that :)
20:21:36 <mwc> When I repeat numerical analysis last year I'm going to troll my prof for using procedural pseudocode
20:22:06 <lispy> uh...my time checker is throwing an error on that sentence :)
20:22:22 <mwc> Could somebody please tell me what's going on with these errors? http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
20:22:29 <mwc> Sorry, next year
20:22:34 <lispy> mwc: at the very bottom?
20:23:08 <lispy> mwc: i'd have to see more of the code
20:23:08 <mwc> Theoretical physics, GR has taught me not to think of past and future :P
20:23:13 <mwc> lispy: no, top of page
20:23:16 <lispy> mwc: are you missing any imports?
20:23:36 <mwc> no
20:23:43 <nailbiter> hm. why can't i write a clause like this?  f x x = True -- after, all, it works in Prolog. :)
20:24:05 <mwc> lispy: why don't I put up the whole thing?
20:24:19 <mwc> (on a pastebin)
20:24:55 <lispy> mwc: i don't see the error right off
20:27:15 <lisppaste2> mwc pasted "Type Explosions" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/7926
20:27:20 <mwc> Niether do I, I'm absolutely stumped
20:27:33 <mwc> there's the whole run and the source
20:29:02 <lispy> mwc: how is Fractional a related to Floating a
20:30:13 <mwc> class  (Fractional a) => Floating a
20:30:16 <lispy> mwc: how about this as an experiment, remove both r * and just leave the cos (t * i)
20:30:25 <mwc> fractional has the (/) operator
20:31:08 <mwc> lispy: same errors
20:33:28 <mwc> I'd guess compiler bug but that's newbie speak for "I don't understand what's going on."
20:33:52 <lispy> mwc: try putting "fromIntegral i" instead of "i"
20:35:54 <mwc> lispy: that changed the error... one of the line numbers is different :P
20:37:54 <lispy> mwc: it could be that fromIntegral i is too local, perhaps the fromIntegral needs to be around the t * i
20:38:12 <lispy> but basically, i think the error is caused by doing Float * Int inside of cos

20:43:37 <mwc> does this mean that t*(fromIntegral i) has type INT?!
20:44:19 <Gahhh> what is t ?
20:44:37 <mwc> nailbiter: I think you want: f _ _ = True

21:03:37 <mwc> It only took me 2 hours
21:03:53 <nailbiter> lispy: i know i'm being silly, but in Prolog, i can do 'f(X, X) = ...' and get exactly that effect. i'm just wondering how best to do it in haskell
21:04:40 <mwc> f x y = x == y
21:05:48 <lispy> nailbiter: yes, prolog has better pattern matching (I think the term is non-linear)
21:06:06 <lispy> nailbiter: are you trying to have == without being an instance of Eq?
21:06:16 <nailbiter> mwc: but suppose it was a much more complicated pattern, say -- f (Tree a@(Tree b c d) _ _) a = True
21:06:48 <nailbiter> lispy: not really -- i've got '==' defined. :) i'm just looking for a syntactic shortcut
21:07:23 <lispy> nailbiter: guards or listing all other patterns first followed by f _ _ = True are the only nice ways i can think of
21:07:58 <nailbiter> lispy: i tried guards first, then remembered they don't fall through to other patterns ..
21:08:40 <lisppaste2> lispy pasted "typing randTest 5 gives (*** Exception: <<loop>>" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/7927

21:12:02 <mwc> Wow, this code's all worked perfectly, modulo syntax errors.
21:13:20 <lispy> fixed my bug, it wasn't in the code i pasted
22:05:00 <nailbiter> Lemmih: oh my god, they do too! :) i'm so dumb ..
22:05:21 <nailbiter> Lemmih: thanks for pointing that out. you've just saved me a whole lot of code
22:08:10 <Lemmih> You're welcome (:
22:15:44 <foxy> ghc has files HSbase.o HSbase1.o HSbase2.o and HSbase3.o, I am having linking errors with undefined symbols, I have located the symbols I need in HSbase1.o, how does ghc decide which one to link?
22:16:49 <Lemmih> Can it be fixed with -package base, perhaps?
22:21:53 <foxy> um, I'm using a dynamic loader (hs-plugins), and the load call doesn't take package arguments, I think it uses make mode

22:33:41 <Pseudonym> Have you ever heard of an 80s band called "Scatterbrain"?
22:34:10 <Pseudonym> They had a song called "Don't Call Me Dude" which fused 50s "doo-wap" boy band with 80s thrash metal.
22:34:36 <Pseudonym> I think that's the most bizarre mix I've ever heard.
22:34:42 <Pseudonym> Though it was a novelty song of sorts.
22:34:57 <mwc> Hypothesis: In Italian, extremeness is linearly proportional to the number of doubled consonants
22:35:12 <mwc> Pseudonym: yeah, this isn't novelty, it's very catchy

22:38:37 <mwc> Hmm, if I have a pair of files SOE.{h,p_hi} in /opt/local/lib/ghc-6.4/imports/Graphics
22:38:42 <mwc> does that mean I can import Graphics.SOE?
22:39:21 <Pseudonym> There's an easy way to find out.
22:40:06 <mwc> Pseudonym: yeah
22:40:21 <mwc> The book is telling me SOEGraphics
22:40:32 <mwc> I'm wondering if this 2002 edition isn't used to hierarchal libs
22:40:38 <mwc> *heirarchial
22:41:14 <Pseudonym> Sounds very plausible.
22:41:26 <foxy> @seen dons
22:41:27 <Lemmih> There's something called Graphics.SOE now
22:41:27 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell. Last spoke 2 hours, 44 minutes and 40 seconds ago
22:41:27 <lambdabot> .
22:41:54 <mwc> Lemmih: that's what I wondered, thanks
22:49:58 <dons> hey
22:51:00 <foxy> dons: I found one symbol that differed by an underscore, how do I fix it?
22:53:53 <dons> ah! excellent
22:54:19 <dons> I'll have to think how to get configure to guess the correct underscore setting
22:54:48 <dons> but that's weird too, i'd expect all syms to have the wrong underscore setting
22:54:51 <foxy> dons: one of the symbols has the same name but still doesn't work
22:55:57 <dons> this sounds weird.
22:56:14 <foxy> dons __stginit_Prelude is ___stginit_Prelude_ (ins HSbase1.o)
22:57:16 <dons> ok, so LEADING_UNDERSCORE=1 for cygwin, it would seem
22:57:41 <dons> in config.h
22:58:23 <foxy> dons: but _GHCziBase_unpackCStringzh_closure is exactly as that in HSbase1.o
22:58:35 <dons> yeah, so this isn't nice.
22:58:43 <dons> we could work around it though
22:59:01 <dons> i'll look in ghc's Linker.c to see if there's any help there
23:02:02 <lispy> i need [((Int, Int), (Int, Bool))], but instead I have [((IO Int, IO Int), (Int, Bool))].  Does that mean I'm just sort of screwed?
23:03:02 <lispy> or is there a way to turn [((IO Int, IO Int), (Int, Bool))] in to IO [((Int, Int), (Int, Bool))] ?
23:03:12 <dons> yes
23:03:38 <lispy> i'm hoping you mean yes to the second one :)
23:04:10 <dons> look in Control.Monad
23:04:12 <dons> e.g.

23:04:25 <lambdabot>          (Monad m) =>
23:04:25 <lambdabot>          [m a] -> m [a]
23:05:06 <lispy> not sure how join would help, but sequence may be helpful
23:10:33 <foxy> mapM (\((a,b),c) -> do { a'<-a;b'<-b;return ((a',b'),c) })

23:13:19 <dons> @pl \(x,y) -> x >>= \x' -> y >= \y' -> return (x',y')
23:13:19 <lispy> that works, then i map it, and get [IO (Int, Int)] which is one step closer :)
23:13:20 <lambdabot> uncurry ((. ((. ((return .) . (,))) . (>=))) . (>>=))

23:18:34 <foxy> is the pointless algorithm complex?
23:27:45 <lispy> i have show defined for my data type, but now that I have IO MyData I can't show it anymore.  What is the standard way of dealing with this?

23:28:40 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThatAnnoyingIoType

23:31:26 <lispy> at least that's what i get out of that
23:33:18 <Lemmih> Yeah, you can't escape from the IO.
23:33:47 <Gahhh> "mwahahaha"
23:34:43 <Gahhh> I wrote a simple haskell app (<40 lines) a few days ago. 85% of the code is within do blocks.
23:34:43 <lispy> i don't think i would mind using monads if the type errors i get inside of do didn't confuse me so much
23:35:15 <lispy> No instances for (Enum (IO a), Num (IO a))
23:35:23 <Gahhh> lispy: I used the explicit syntax (>>=, >>, lambda funcs) to get used to what happens to the types.
23:37:39 <lispy> so i take my list [(IO Int, IO Int)], then i map repair on it, this gives me [IO (Int, Int)], then I apply sequence which gives me IO [(Int, Int)], then in a do block I have g <- sequence ..., but when I try to use g in futher computation I get that error message
23:39:30 <Gahhh> why not paste the do block to a paste webpage
23:39:39 <Lemmih> @paste
23:39:40 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
23:42:05 <lisppaste2> lispy pasted "confused by errors" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/7933
23:42:20 <lispy> i can give more code if that doesn't help
23:43:15 <lispy> for example, :t randomGraph gives randomGraph :: forall a.
23:43:17 <lispy>       (Num a, Random a, Enum (IO a), Num (IO a), Ord a) =>
23:43:19 <lispy>       a -> [(IO a, IO a)]
23:44:20 <Lemmih> randomGraph is wrong then.
23:44:48 <lispy> in what way?
23:45:08 <Gahhh> what is its type ?
23:45:14 <lispy> it should return IO [(a, a)] ?
23:45:35 <lispy> Gahhh: randomGraph is that really ugly type i just pasted
23:45:57 <Lemmih> You use something of type (IO a) as a number and as an enum.
23:47:34 <lispy> ah, that would be this line[1..randomInt n]
23:47:40 <lispy> i should fix that
23:49:40 <Lemmih> @pl randomInt n >>= \t -> [1..t]
23:49:41 <lambdabot> enumFromTo 1 =<< randomInt n
23:50:03 <Lemmih> @pl randomInt n >>= \t -> return [1..t]
23:50:05 <lambdabot> enumFromTo 1 `fmap` randomInt n
23:51:50 <lispy> what is @pl?
23:52:01 <Lemmih> @help pl
23:52:02 <lambdabot>  @pointless <expr> - play with pointfree code
23:52:51 <lispy> ah, it's just a short cut?
23:53:13 <lispy> i'd seen @pointless before
