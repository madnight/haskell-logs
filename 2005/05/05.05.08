00:00:05 <xyzp> Ah, but it's not particularly popular for OS work.
00:00:32 <Gahhh> I dont see why not. You can use the C subset if you really have to.
00:00:46 <xyzp> That seems like cheating for our hypothetical purposes.
00:01:08 <Gahhh> a lot of C++ programmers write C in *.cc extensions anyways.
00:01:17 <Arrogant> shapr: He's removing lambda? But lambda is vital to my hacks.
00:01:18 <xyzp> Hmm.
00:01:24 <Gahhh> "printf, scanf, etc."
00:01:31 <xyzp> Well, they certainly don't often write 'modern' C++.
00:01:37 <shapr> Arrogant: mine too. I advise you to switch to Haskell ;-)
00:01:48 <xyzp> Too many legacy frameworks.
00:02:32 <Gahhh> xyzp: That is true. But many are not aware of the C++ specific stuff just because the C counterpart is still there.
00:02:53 <xyzp> That seems like a sign of incomplete learning.
00:03:02 <Arrogant> shapr: I don't actually seriously use lambda though, so no worries :P
00:03:05 <Gahhh> shapr: I just noticed that I'm still using Python 2.3.4. Any reason why I should consider a newer version ?
00:03:17 <shapr> Not that I know of.
00:03:21 <Arrogant> Gahhh: Generator expressions and decorators
00:03:25 <Arrogant> Generator expressions are good.
00:03:30 <Gahhh> I didnt like the generators much
00:03:44 <xyzp> I use lambda when I write small things in the python interpreter to do throw-away work.
00:03:46 <Arrogant> :o
00:03:59 <shapr> http://haskell.org/hawiki/PythonGenerator
00:04:03 <Arrogant> Actually, lambda is handy for property
00:04:12 <Gahhh> I use lambda's all over in python
00:04:12 <shapr> http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/601
00:04:28 <Arrogant> image = property(lambda self: self._image, setImage)
00:08:03 <Gahhh> Arrogant: I remember that I didnt like that fact that Ihad to use a try block for generators
00:08:12 <xyzp> Ah. I see Brandon's still at it.
00:08:40 <Gahhh> xyzp: Half Life 3 will be written in ocaml, I promise.
00:09:20 <Arrogant> Gahhh: you had to use a try block for generators? :o
00:09:24 <shapr> I recently ranted about ocaml on my blog.
00:10:07 <xyzp> Paradigmatic idiomatic use of the language.
00:10:08 <shapr> Even so, I bet it would be faster to develop hl3 in OCaml than in C or C++.
00:10:14 <xyzp> I've found a new favorite phrase.
00:10:23 <Gahhh> Arrogant: The reference says when "gen.next()" fails, it throws StopIteration.
00:10:45 <xyzp> I think just transfering development to a studio other than Valve would halve its dev time.
00:10:50 <Arrogant> Right, it does.
00:11:08 <Arrogant> gen.next is usually called implicitly though :?
00:11:09 <Arrogant> :/
00:11:09 <Gahhh> xyzp: ... or not using Outlook Express
00:11:12 <Arrogant> With for loops
00:11:21 <Arrogant> And gen.next isn't supposed to fail.
00:11:28 <shapr> Interesting - http://www.codecomments.com/Functional/message454972.html
00:11:50 <xyzp> Eh, the game wasn't even finished.
00:11:56 <xyzp> They were lying about the release date anyway.
00:15:16 <shapr> Is He the guy who was politely thrown off the python-dev list?
00:15:25 <xyzp> Probably.
00:15:31 <xyzp> He managed to irk Guido.
00:15:35 <shapr> Wow
00:15:37 <xyzp> I don't know if he was thrown off.
00:15:50 <xyzp> He's managed to become uninvited by a lot of people...
00:16:29 <lisppaste2> Gahhh pasted "Python error" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/8051
00:16:50 <Gahhh> shapr: Can you see what is wrong with that code ?
00:19:27 <shapr> What error do you get?
00:19:38 <Gahhh> shapr: I had to replace the "lambda s:.." with "blah" because python complained about "unqualified exec with free variables". I dont see why there are any free variables in there.
00:20:46 <musasabi> morning
00:20:51 <shapr> hei musasabi
00:21:24 <musasabi> shapr: TMR3 - let me think about it - I will say something early next week.
00:21:28 <shapr> Ok
00:21:47 <xerox> yo
00:21:53 <MachinShin> night all
00:22:09 <shapr> y0 y0 xerox
00:22:25 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: ping.
00:23:08 <SyntaxNinja> hi xerox
00:25:16 <JohnMeacham> musasabi: pong.
00:26:17 <musasabi> About jhc's GenUtil.hs and lookupEnv there, the fail in IO and not the inner monad seems like a bug.
00:29:04 <JohnMeacham> Oh. it looks like it is a bug.
00:29:05 <shapr> Gahhh: what about setattr(eval('mySetup.' + field),Func(fI.readline().strip()))
00:29:34 <shapr> er, wait...
00:30:11 <shapr> Gahhh: setattr(eval('mySetup'),field,Func(fI.readline().strip()))
00:30:54 <JohnMeacham> it should be 'return (fail (show e))'
00:32:09 <Gahhh> shapr: the problem is not with setattr. When I removed the pair with the lambda, there are no complaints. So I gave in and defined the "blah" function outside the for loop and it worked.
00:33:53 <shapr> Looks to me like you're trying to write Haskell in Python.
00:34:11 <shapr> Not that I know why it didn't work :-)
00:34:39 <Gahhh> yeah it looked legal to me :) bad haskell influences...
00:35:43 <xerox> "bad"
00:35:44 <shapr> Oh, the lambda is the nested function with free variables.
00:35:47 <xyzp> lambda is Python is just transformed into a nested function
00:35:52 <xyzp> Yes.
00:36:04 <xyzp> If you use exec with in globals(), locals() it would work, I think.
00:36:23 <xyzp> Kind of messy?
00:36:26 <xyzp> Eh.
00:36:34 <Gahhh> I see
00:36:47 <JohnMeacham> musasabi: thanks. I will fix it.
00:37:03 <xyzp> is=in
00:37:12 <Gahhh> xyzp: I saw that bit of advice in the reference manual, but didnt think it would "capture" the var because I thought it was not free to begin with.
00:37:50 <xyzp> I don't think it should be.
00:38:57 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: Here are some haddock patches for jhc http://youzen.b2.fi/~musasabi/haddock01.patch
00:41:55 <shapr> I really truly wish that the JVM were more flexible from the beginning. I wish it supported TCO at least.
00:42:49 <xyzp> Ah, it's the int in the lambda.
00:42:53 <xyzp> Hmm.
00:43:08 <Gahhh> xyzp: how do you tell ?
00:43:41 <xyzp> Well in this case by trial and error.
00:43:42 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: just in case you haven't talk to Diablo-D3 before...he's a bit of a troll
00:44:06 <Gahhh> xyzp: that is evil.
00:44:13 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: yeah, I've heard that before, but haven't actually witnessed it. what an annoying conversation.
00:44:24 <xyzp> Or maybe the map.
00:44:30 <xyzp> It seems any function application.
00:44:42 <SyntaxNinja> I blame myself, though, for assuming that some random internet-user's opinion is founded on anything whatsoever.
00:45:57 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: hehe
00:47:06 <xyzp> Yep.
00:47:13 <xyzp> Any function application in the lambda does it.
00:47:28 <xyzp> exec ... in globals() seems to make it work
00:48:06 <xyzp> Haha.
00:48:11 <Gahhh> xyzp: thanks
00:48:12 <xyzp> exec ... in {} too.
00:48:21 <Gahhh> that's a lol, imho
00:48:53 <SyntaxNinja> 'night #haskell
00:49:00 <Gahhh> nite ninja
00:49:04 * shapr waves
00:55:04 <juhp> ah good job I darcs pull'ed jhc and ran make on the buildtree with ghc-6-4-branch
00:55:54 * juhp so wishes ghc could have compatible ABI for releases in the same series at least one day...
00:58:37 <JohnMeacham> musasabi: cool. patch applied.
01:01:13 <musasabi> thanks :-)
01:04:54 <xyzp> Ah, that makes sense come to think of it.
01:07:55 <Gahhh> xyzp: ?
01:09:57 <musasabi> A standard solution for casting could be nice in Haskell - maybe "class Cast a b where cast :: a -> b", and "class CastM a b m where castM :: a -> m b" or something similar?
01:10:27 <shapr> autrijus is doing something much like that in Pugs.
01:13:10 <JohnMeacham> it is brought up every now and again. it is hard to do without a lot of ambiguity and different people have different ideas of how things should cast.
01:14:45 <musasabi> Currently most applications either define some form of cast, or use classes like "class FromFoo a where fromFoo :: Foo -> a" and "class ToFoo a where toFoo :: a -> Foo" + possibly monadic variants.
01:15:18 <JohnMeacham> I tend to use casting classes where one side is fixed. as in FromString, ToString, toAtom, ... etc as they tend to be less prone to abiguity errors.
01:15:23 <dbremner> Gahhh - with respect to research and industry, new developments seem to take about 20 years to get from the lab to mainstream.
01:16:49 <Gahhh> dbremner: I had to scroll quite a bit for that one. Probably correct.
01:17:45 <Gahhh> dbremner: The group I was referring to is 10+ years behind the industry, not research.
01:18:08 <dbremner> Gahhh - One of the points Fred Brooks makes in No Silver Bullet is that there have been no major productivity advances since HLLs.
01:18:13 <dons> juhp, it doesn't?
01:18:31 <dons> I thought SimonM was very strict on X.Y.* having the same ABI
01:18:49 <dbremner> Gahhh - Fortran77?
01:18:51 <JohnMeacham> same API but not ABI I think.
01:19:00 <shapr> dbremner: Do you agree with that?
01:19:05 <juhp> right
01:19:07 <dons> oh, ABI. of course.
01:19:13 <Gahhh> dbremner: well, I recently read Don Box admitting that OOP/COM didn't work. So yeah, probably not.
01:19:15 <dons> that would be cool!
01:19:27 <xyzp> Gahhh: The function being needs to be looked up in a series of dictionaries.
01:19:56 <dbremner> shapr - It's something I think about from time to time. There are arguments on both sides. I would call CPAN the most successful case of reuse in history.
01:20:20 * juhp rebuilds ghc-6.4 with the ffi patches...
01:20:30 <xyzp> If you passed it as an implicit argument and used it, it would also disambiguate the usage in the lambda.
01:20:46 <xyzp> Hmm.
01:21:12 <Gahhh> xyzp: I just don't buy that "int" and "map" are variables.
01:21:20 <dbremner> Gahhh - do you have a link for that?
01:21:29 <xyzp> They are of course.
01:21:52 <Gahhh> dbremner: yes
01:22:48 <xyzp> I wonder why I added an extraneous 'being' to my sentence.
01:22:55 <xyzp> I should probably sleep more often.
01:23:06 <dbremner> shapr - I haven't been involved with many software projects but in my experience, tools aren't a showstopper. At work, I've never thought, if only I had monads, I could complete this project.
01:23:13 <Gahhh> dbremner: http://news.com.com/2100-1046_3-5148148.html
01:24:34 <dbremner> Gahhh - I don't interpret that as saying OOP/DCOM don't work, just that they're not silver bullets.
01:24:41 <Gahhh> xyzp: map is a variable ! I just executed "map = 4" and lost my map'ping abilities in python!
01:24:41 <xyzp> Hmm.
01:24:44 <shapr> dbremner: After a few minutes of thought, I propose refactoring browsers as a counter argument.
01:24:51 <xyzp> Yes.
01:25:07 <xyzp> Everything in Python is basically an entry in a dictionary.
01:25:08 * Gahhh is floored
01:25:48 <dbremner> shapr - refactoring browsers and unit tests certainly make modification easier, but does it compare to the introduction of HLLs?
01:25:54 <Gahhh> dbremner: "he said, object-oriented programming is just not all it was made out to be."
01:26:08 <shapr> Yes, I think it does.
01:26:17 <Gahhh> shapr: I don't
01:26:24 <shapr> Unit tests are nice, but I refactoring browsers are divine.
01:26:44 <shapr> Gahhh: Have you used a refactoring browser on a commercial project?
01:27:03 <shapr> How about, what experiences lead you to that conclusion?
01:27:05 <dbremner> Gahhh - It was hyped aggressively, same as structured programming, extreme programming, etc.
01:27:15 <xyzp> Haha.
01:27:19 <xyzp> XP was funny.
01:27:51 <Gahhh> shapr: I've never used a refactoring browser. I just think that although refactoring needs to be done, it doesn't constitute the majority of the work, imho.
01:27:54 <shapr> I like XP, it's just a collection of sensible ways to do things imho.
01:28:10 <xyzp> I've never particularly cared for pair-programming.
01:28:19 <shapr> Oh, I love pair programming.
01:28:37 <dbremner> Gahhh - Gabriel presents a more compelling argument. http://dreamsongs.com/ObjectsHaveFailedNarrative.html
01:28:42 <Gahhh> xyzp: Pair programming worked for me in a few cases.
01:28:55 <shapr> Gahhh: I think that using a real refactoring browser may change your mind.
01:29:13 <dbremner> shapr - I initially stayed away from XP because of their emphasis on the C3 project.
01:29:57 <shapr> I joined WardsWiki around the time of C3, so I had a lot of discussions while XP was happening.
01:30:14 <dbremner> shapr - I've never used a refactoring browser in anger, so don't know enough to say.
01:30:27 <shapr> I think that's why I was immune to the good and bad sides of the hype, I got to argue with the XP guys about what and why.
01:31:18 <dbremner> shapr - pair programming is very similar to how we mentor new techs, so I can understand why it could work.
01:31:45 <shapr> Yeah, master/journeyman/apprentice is an old pattern.
01:32:03 <shapr> Also, you don't get to see process from a book.
01:32:54 <shapr> I had the idea to do 'read-only pair programming' by recording the changes to a file that happen during a single change and then playing it back as a source-movie.
01:33:04 <xyzp> I think it's wasteful and probably contributes unnecessary expense.
01:33:25 <dbremner> shapr - C3 was ultimately a failure, though. That seemed to represent a failing in XP, if their most popular example wasn't a success.
01:33:36 <shapr> xyzp: You may be right, there are statistics on both sides of the issue.
01:34:01 <dbremner> xyzp - Inspection is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of identify bugs.
01:34:16 <xyzp> I'd rather not have my job exported because it costs more for me to do my own work.
01:34:27 <shapr> dbremner: It depends on how you define failure. It worked and kept on working long after the C3 team was gone. So it did deliver business value immediately and continue to increase its business value.
01:34:40 <xyzp> That is to say that it doesn't necessarily expose flaws, but certainly requires manpower.
01:35:09 <shapr> In my opinion, programming is a service. If we do our job to the best of our ability, we code ourselves out of a job.
01:35:23 <dbremner> shapr - there were certainly a lot of politics involved also. It just caused me to initially steer clear of it.
01:35:58 <xyzp> I'd rather code myself out of a job than to be priced out ;)
01:36:06 <shapr> Yeah, I try to steer clear of politics too.
01:36:06 <jewel> shapr, that's a silly way to think
01:36:15 <shapr> jewel: How so?
01:36:27 <jewel> do you think the world will stop wanting software?
01:36:40 <shapr> No, I think my job is to create systems that the users can use by themselves.
01:37:13 <jewel> it doesn't matter, there is always a level of expertise that they will want to pay for
01:37:16 <thou> hi, folks; i have a very simple question: my 'len' function causes a stack overflow, but the Prelude length function doesn't; may someone please enlighten me on why?  http://pastebin.com/281195  thanks!
01:37:27 <xyzp> Ah, but then they'll be too lazy to RTFM and they'll need assistance anyway.
01:37:39 <shapr> The C3 software worked long after the C3 guys had other jobs. That's how I'd like to run my career.
01:38:57 <pediddle> thou: try making it tail recursive with a helper function
01:39:00 <xyzp> It can't be tail-call optimized because you're adding the result of the application.
01:39:29 <thou> ah
01:39:37 <thou> so w/ an accumulator arg in a helper func
01:39:42 <xyzp> Yep.
01:39:44 <pediddle> right
01:39:46 <thou> k
01:40:11 <xyzp> Haskell is such a pretty language.
01:40:28 <shapr> Along the same lines, I realized that the third time I accomplish a certain task with a computer, it should be easier than the first time, otherwise I'm doing something wrong. To me, 'linear' difficulty is a sign that I'm not automating.
01:40:34 <dbremner> shapr - I've always liked this quote from Mob Software: the Erotic Life of Code. Software development methodologies evolved under this regime [figure it out, code it up, compile it, run it, throw it away] along with a mythical belief in master planning. Such beliefs were rooted in an elementary-school-level fiction that great masterpieces were planned, or arose as a by-product of physicists shovelling menial and rote coding tasks to 
01:42:26 <Maddas> QuickCheck is really cool
01:42:27 <shapr> I've worked in companies like that. Everyone thought everyone else had the master plan we were all following.
01:42:47 <shapr> Maddas: Yeah! It rocks!
01:43:38 <dbremner> shapr - when I started working on my current project, I started planning for turnover. Then I read Agile Software Development and decided that if my plan wasn't affected by turnover, something was horribly wrong.
01:43:41 <shapr> dbremner: what's the rest of the quote?
01:43:56 <shapr> Last I saw was "physicists shovelling menial and rote coding tasks to "
01:44:28 <thou> pediddle: http://pastebin.com/281200 (what did I do wrong?)
01:45:01 <dons> @ghc
01:45:02 <lambdabot>  lexical error in string/character literal
01:45:26 <Gahhh> dons: better than offending program, eh ?
01:45:39 <shapr> Yeah, I don't really understand this obsession with secure employment, secure social communities, etc. Change is the only constant. My philosophy is to do the best I can where I am, and remember that everything is temporary.
01:45:50 <dons> Gahhh, hehe
01:45:53 <dbremner> shapr - hmm, your/my client must have cut it off. http://www.dreamsongs.com/MobSoftware.html
01:46:20 <dbremner> shapr - also on this page. http://www.schnada.de/quotes/contempt.html
01:46:30 <lispy> shapr: but, many people resist change, so i that obessions with security are natures if that is what you mean by security
01:46:48 <Gahhh> shapr: I survived 4-5 waves of layoffs since 2001. You're damn right change is constant heh.
01:46:53 <lispy> god, i didn't type that right at all...
01:47:11 <Gahhh> lispy: I'd like to have what you're drinking
01:47:23 <lispy> heh, it's called 1:45 am :)
01:47:45 <tuomov> Wanting secure employment etc. just follows from wanting to secure living, and not being able to think outside the box
01:48:04 <thou> pediddle: nevermind, looks like if I compile w/ -O then the new one works
01:48:06 <shapr> Life is good where I am, and it's also good somewhere else. That applies mentally, physically, and emotionally.
01:48:08 <dbremner> Gahhh - in my department, I have seniority - and I've only been here since September. Everyone else has left. In a company of ~40 people, I'm #5 in seniority.
01:48:31 <jewel> security is very important
01:48:57 <jewel> most people living in poverty are striving to get just a little bit of stability and security
01:49:19 <Gahhh> dbremner: that's incredible.
01:49:21 <dbremner> jewel - #2 on Maslow's hierarchy.
01:49:48 <dbremner> Gahhh - believe me, that's only the tip of the iceberg.
01:49:52 <lispy> jewel: right, and it's a powerful incentive to pay the bad at math tax
01:49:55 <Gahhh> There are people to whom health benefits mean more than the job itself. I don't blame them.
01:49:57 <lispy> aka lottery
01:50:19 <jewel> "bad at math tax"?
01:50:22 <dbremner> Gahhh - I'm one of them. With benefits, I pay ~$90 month.
01:50:24 <jewel> ah
01:51:01 <Maddas> shapr: I haven't even used it yet, but the paper alone shocked me in a good way :-)
01:51:06 <shapr> I think the best security I can get is to keep my mind and body in good shape so that I am always adaptible.
01:51:11 <pediddle> thou: i was going to suggest that
01:51:16 <Maddas> (How systematically he introduces and extends stuff)
01:51:33 <pediddle> but my poor 256MB ram didn't let me test it in time :)
01:51:33 <foxy_> My ghci (6.4) keeps crashing on windows, is this a reported problem?
01:51:43 <shapr> You'll like part two, the QuickCheckST paper.
01:52:17 <shapr> And there's various unreleased QC code, and modifications like the test-driven-development hack I added.
01:52:39 <shapr> Maybe I should write a QC tutorial for TMR3.
01:52:51 <Maddas> Gahhh: I can understand that very well.
01:52:55 <Maddas> (Not that I know anything about how much of a difference a company makes :-)
01:53:08 <Maddas> shapr: Heh, yeah, I've got it sitting on my hard disk already :-)
01:53:10 <dbremner> shapr - reminds me of this quote. "Security is an illusion. Life is either a daring adventure or it is nothing at all. " - Helen Keller.
01:53:23 <shapr> Yeah, I agree with that.
01:54:04 <lispy> TMR3?
01:54:11 <lispy> does lambdabot do factoids?
01:54:18 <lispy> @fact tmr3
01:54:20 <lambdabot> I know nothing about tmr3.
01:54:28 <lispy> interesting

02:02:19 <shapr> Webbh‰xorna
02:02:28 <shapr> I thought that was pretty funny the first time I noticed.
02:02:41 <shapr> Webbh‰xor is "webwitches"
02:02:58 <Maddas> Does the second part mean "witches" or does the whole thing as a word really exist?
02:03:34 <Maddas> Pardon my ignorance :-)
02:03:46 <tuomov> apparently h√§xa=witch, h√§xorna is the plural definite

02:09:05 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - Charity guarantees termination. http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html there was a LtU discussion about it.
02:09:07 <Maddas> He approved
02:09:29 <shapr> Cool, what did you get?
02:09:32 <Maddas> (And was glad I asked in advance whether it's OK)
02:09:38 <Maddas> Approval
02:09:44 <Maddas> For the Bodyflying thing (:
02:09:46 <JohnMeacham> dbremner: cool.
02:09:57 <shapr> How'd you like it? I haven't tried it yet?
02:10:09 * shapr boings
02:10:11 <Maddas> shapr, @memorysnack
02:10:14 <shapr> I bet it was a blast.
02:10:29 <Maddas> It's on Wednesday :-) But yeah, I bet it'll be
02:10:42 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - Hume is a functional language intended for safety-critical systems.
02:11:34 <JohnMeacham> interesting, does it have a web site?
02:11:43 <Maddas> Registration was very, uh, studentish, though. There were 15 spots (that wasn't mentioned in advance) and far more than that were already standing around waiting for the guy to arrive, so I was lucky to get in. Helps being there with someone who doesn't mind using his elbows a bit :-P
02:11:45 <Maddas> Yup, www.bodyflying.ch
02:11:49 <JohnMeacham> ooh.
02:11:52 <JohnMeacham> I found it.
02:12:07 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - it's a neat idea.
02:12:07 <shapr> Maddas: Spiffy, I expect you to write it up on your blog.
02:12:19 <Maddas> shapr: Haha.
02:12:39 <Maddas> JohnMeacham: (That's just where I'm going, it's not the only place of course)
02:13:22 <Maddas> shapr: I have so far resisted the temptation to create one and I still stand unwavering!
02:13:45 <shapr> heh, ok
02:13:52 <JohnMeacham> They have one of those in vegas. I hear it takes a bit to learn how to stay centered.
02:14:15 <shapr> I enjoy writing on my blog, it's a good way for people with similar interests to find me.
02:15:21 <shapr> hoi boegel
02:15:35 <Maddas> shapr: Yeah, you've got always got plenty of interesting (crazy) ideas to talk about :-)
02:16:24 <dbremner> shapr - I may start one.
02:16:53 <shapr> Yeah, far more than I ever discuss. I did hook up with an industrial design friend of mine recently and ask her to look at my list of ideas that may be worth building.
02:17:41 <Maddas> Sounds great!
02:18:18 <shapr> Anything that's not worth building gets a detailed description and pictures and goes on my blog in hopes of inspiring others.
02:18:27 <Maddas> Tell us more, I'm logging everything! :-P
02:18:37 <dbremner> shapr - Lion Kimbro does something similar.
02:18:53 <Maddas> shapr: I see, sounds like you (:
02:19:26 <shapr> Did you see the 3D scene reconstruction slashdot article?
02:19:42 <Maddas> Nope
02:20:18 <shapr> It uses stereo vision to create a partial 3D model. I realized that can be extended very far.
02:20:45 <Maddas> Heh. Is it a link to something or is the article itself (only) on slashdot?
02:20:48 * Maddas looks
02:21:26 <shapr> Especially for military or other exploration teams where you have separated but synchronized cameras, you could build a much more detailed model of everything. All of your team could give each other wallhack.
02:21:29 <Maddas> shapr: By the way, do you ever print papers to read them?
02:22:06 <shapr> I've printed a few, but I'm hoping Fermat's Last Margin will be a better solution.
02:22:11 <Maddas> Ok
02:22:34 <Maddas> shapr: I think I may already have told you, but I started writing notes on margins myself not too long back :-)
02:23:02 <shapr> It's a good practice.
02:23:02 <Maddas> And I now think it's a Good Thing :-) I just never saw the need for it before
02:23:27 <Maddas> I guess I never read sufficiently hard/interesting books before
02:23:38 <boegel> hey shapr (and everyone else)
02:23:56 <shapr> Some of my best ideas happen the instant I see a new thing. I also like to write my assumptions into the front of a technical book before I read it to see what changes.
02:24:20 <Maddas> Heh!
02:24:40 <dbremner> shapr - that sounds like one of Hamming's tips in You and Your Research.
02:24:53 <shapr> Hm, it does.
02:24:54 <Maddas> If I ever start doing that I'll know that your ideas grow on me subconsciously (:
02:25:11 <shapr> Well, it's applied metacognition.
02:25:30 <Maddas> I think I know what you mean :-)
02:25:41 <shapr> I learn more when I realize that I don't know everything.
02:25:42 <Maddas> Chalmers has almost all technical courses in English, right?
02:25:52 <shapr> I don't know.
02:26:08 <shapr> hiya Gizem, looking for Haskell info?
02:26:34 <Maddas> Yeah, you need to realize that in order to realize how much there still /is/ to be learned and how much fun it can be to find new things
02:26:35 <shapr> Guess not.
02:27:03 <Maddas> er, "to find out about"
02:28:02 <shapr> I'm glad I live in a time where I have access to large amounts of information.
02:28:15 <Maddas> I particularly enjoy finding new connections between things that seemed unrelated before
02:28:18 <Maddas> Yup
02:29:21 <xyzp_> That's probably always the case.
02:29:32 <dbremner> Maddas - IIRC, the Hamming tip was to keep 10-12 problems in your working set and try to connect everything you learn with those problems.
02:29:40 <xyzp_> That is, life is basically finite information processing.
02:30:11 <Maddas> xyzp: Dunno, I was very disappointed to find out that many students don't seem to care about the subjects we're studying
02:30:20 <xyzp_> At any particular timeframe, one may or may not consider themselves in a state of having access to a lot of information.
02:30:30 <xyzp_> I guess it largely depends on how one looks at things.
02:30:49 <Maddas> xyzp: Anytime I ask about something (usually about fundamental stuff), the answer is pretty much "I don't know. Why do you care? It's not part of the exam"
02:30:57 <Maddas> xyzp: For most students, that is. I really don't understand that stance :-)
02:31:05 <xyzp_> Ah, laziness.
02:31:15 <Maddas> Disinterest, really
02:31:17 <xyzp_> I guess we're sort of spoiled?
02:31:34 <xyzp_> We don't really need to know many things to be content.
02:31:51 <Maddas> I do :-)
02:32:01 <xyzp_> Ah, but you probably receive pleasure from it.
02:32:06 <Maddas> Yup
02:32:07 <xyzp_> So it's like pushing your happy button.
02:32:30 <xyzp_> They'd much rather fornicate or eat a cupcake or something, I'm sure.
02:32:33 <shapr> Sometimes I wish my happy button produced more software.
02:32:43 <Maddas> xyzp: Yes, that's the part I don't really understand ;-)
02:33:48 <shapr> In my priorities sex > learning > cupcakes.
02:33:59 <Maddas> I can understand being happy without knowing much. But once you have a critical mass of knowledge, you can't stop. At least that's what I feel.
02:34:01 <Maddas> shapr: Hah :-)
02:34:01 <shapr> I guess it's a good thing I'm a geek.
02:34:36 <Maddas> Why, are you bad at making cupcakes?
02:34:37 <Maddas> :-P
02:34:51 <shapr> um...
02:37:26 <xyzp_> I'd generally go learning > coitus > cupcakes.
02:37:41 <xyzp_> I think that much fornicating would break something.
02:38:34 <dbremner> I'd say it depends. If I'm in the middle of a breakthrough learning is higher priority.
02:39:08 <Maddas> xyzp: The reason why I don't understand it is that those people are also studying with me. I don't see why one would study at a university if you don't enjoy the learning itself (at least for many of the subjects), I'd not consider the payoff alone worth the cost if I didn't enjoy university
02:39:11 <Maddas> Anyway, gotta go, later :-)
02:39:14 <boegel> xyzp: sex tops everything !
02:39:20 * shapr agrees with boegel 
02:39:27 <shapr> cya Maddas
02:39:47 <dbremner> Maddas - 75% of Americans go to college to raise their salary.
02:39:52 <xyzp> Degree inflation has made it necessary to obtain a job that pays decently.
02:40:23 <xyzp> I suppose it's a vicious cycle.
02:40:57 <xyzp> Even if you're only majoring in Philosophy or English, you'll need a degree to earn a comfortable salary.
02:41:05 <xyzp> Hmm.
02:41:48 <xyzp> You go, you major in bullshit, and then you just socialize without "adult" supervision.
02:41:51 <lightstep> the stm paper says that parallel::[IO()]->IO() is impossible in concurent haskell. why is this?
02:42:26 <boegel> hey lightstep , Oejet
02:42:50 <dbremner> lightstep - earlier you mentioned 10 seconds before getting 80k/sec. You might try changing your TCP window settings.
02:42:54 <Oejet> Hello, boegel.
02:43:21 <thou> lightstep: my understanding is that concurrent haskell doesn't use OS threads; it just uses its own user-land threading, so it can't run on more than one CPU
02:43:30 <lightstep> dbremner, yeah, i might. the admin wasn't available yesterday
02:43:42 <thou> lightstep: is that what you mean?
02:44:03 <dbremner> lightstep - I've found it to make a significant difference in vulnerability assessment scans.
02:44:21 <Oejet> thou: Although, there is something interesting brewing at Haskell HQ in that department.
02:45:18 <lightstep> "a function of type mergeIO :: [IO a] -> IO a is un-implementable in Concurrent Haskell" -- from the paper
02:45:56 <lightstep> i guess they didn't mean it literally, but i don't understand, since they have forkIO
02:46:35 <Oejet> I've read the paper, maybe I can help explain?
02:47:19 <lightstep> it's near the end of section 4.3
02:48:09 <lightstep> they want some sort of semantics for this operation that are only available in stm, but it isn't clear what these should be
02:50:02 <Oejet> Oh, the reason (mergeIO :: [IO a] -> IO) is unimplementable is that you cannot undo an IO action, but you have to actually run it to get the results you want to choose from.
02:50:52 <lightstep> oh, i thought merge was parallel merge. now i see what they meant
02:51:32 <lightstep> but you do have unsafeInterleaveIO?
02:52:01 <lightstep> which the diagrams portray as duplicating and throwing the world
02:54:24 <Oejet> lightstep: That is just what I needed for the Bzlib2 binding, thanks!
02:56:11 <Oejet> I don't think unsageInterleaveIO has anything to do with merges.
02:56:16 <TheHunter> ah, mergeIO = msum.
02:56:35 <TheHunter> err, merge = msum.
02:57:00 <Oejet> msum = ?
02:57:14 <TheHunter> @type Control.Monad.msum
02:57:15 <lightstep> msum = fold mzero mplus
02:57:19 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.msum :: forall a (m :: * -> *).
02:57:19 <lambdabot>         (Control.Monad.MonadPlus m) =>
02:57:19 <lambdabot>         [m a] -> m a
02:57:35 <lightstep> Oejet, i don't get it
02:58:15 <Oejet> lightstep: Maybe I got into the conversation too late, and I don't know what you are talking about. :-P
02:59:49 <lightstep> you joined ~33 seconds after me
03:00:39 <Oejet> (mergeSTM :: [STM a] -> STM a) Runs the list elements from left to right and if an element retrys then that element is skipped.  If an elemt is run to completion it returns that value.
03:01:20 <lightstep> yes, i understand it now. i didn't bother reading the fold before because i thought it would be complicated (yes, it *is* only two words)
03:01:49 <lightstep> but i'm feeling bad about ircing from school like that, so i'm leaving now, and will reconnect from home
03:11:45 <shapr> I need some way to do test fixtures with HUnit.
03:13:08 <shapr> For example, I don't see a good way to delete the file after the test --> assertEqualM "whsave file" 36047 (whsave "http://127.0.0.1/~shae/jfp.ps.gz" "jfp.ps.gz" >> getFileSize "jfp.ps.gz")
03:14:35 <vegai> download all test files into a separate dir and remove the dir after thests
03:14:48 <shapr> hm, good idea.
03:14:59 <vegai> really? :)
03:15:05 <shapr> Doesn't solve the problem, but does push it a bit further into the future.
03:15:39 <shapr> And I'm trying to improve the tested software rather than improve the testing software.
03:55:43 <lispy> i don't think i would appreciate function programming as much if it weren't for C++
03:57:28 <lispy> i once read something by an avid c++ programmer that basically said, programming is for programmers.
03:58:13 <lispy> it made me realize that catering to the machine is not the way to write code or languages :)
03:58:30 <lispy> and C++ demonstrates this point :)
04:28:46 <boegel> someone from Japan seems quite interested in Haskell+raytracing :)
04:30:18 <TheHunter> shapr, (ad line-wrapping). Fixed. This is a stupid bug i introduced when rewriting the line-wrapping code: last $ possiblyEmptyList ++ [defaultCase]. I really shouldn't just assume the code is correct if it type checks.
04:31:12 <lispy> TheHunter: is that for lambdabot?
04:31:20 <TheHunter> yes.
04:31:24 <lispy> nice
04:44:51 <goron> shapr: Do you know how double work is avoided in darcs development?
04:53:37 <shapr> goron: What double work?
04:53:47 <shapr> TheHunter: Oh, I thought it was the old code from long ago.
04:53:55 <shapr> Not that I ever fixed it...
04:54:24 <TheHunter> that code sucked, because it would break as early as possible.
04:54:52 <TheHunter> that totally messed up the dict output.
04:55:43 <Lemmih> Morning.
04:58:47 <TheHunter> @index withSocketsDo
04:58:50 <lambdabot> Network.Socket, Network

05:00:17 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/network/Network.Socket.html
05:03:25 <goron> shapr: Well, suppose X and Y see bug Z, and they decide to fix it. Now, one of them has spend time for it for nothing.
05:05:32 <basti_> hey
05:07:58 <shapr> goron: I think by doing darcs pull -a to see if someone else has already fixed the bug, and if not, fixing it quickly and sending out the patch.
05:08:13 <shapr> hiya basti_
05:08:41 <Heffalump> goron: how is that any worse than with any other RCS (or no RCS at all)?
05:08:47 <Heffalump> s/R/V/g
05:09:34 <shapr> Though I guess a better solution might be to first submit a unit test that catches the bug, and saving that with intent to fix.
05:09:35 <Heffalump> arguably 'darcs send' makes it better because if that goes to a mailing list then the gap between sending in the patch and it being applied by the maintainer isn't an 'at-risk' period
05:09:49 <Igloo> Some VCSs lock files when you check them out, but that obviously has its own issues
05:10:32 <shapr> It would be interesting to associate patches with bug reports.
05:12:57 <goron> shapr: So the idea is that you don't work days on one thing, but commit a lot?
05:13:01 <goron> Heffalump: nothing.
05:13:37 <shapr> Yeah, I think working days on one thing would decrease the value of a distributed vcs.
05:14:00 <Heffalump> I would happily work days on something
05:14:18 <Heffalump> having a distributed VCS gives me the opportunity to record and test partial changes without polluting the main repository
05:14:21 <shapr> I try to do sandglass programming even, http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SandglassProgramming
05:14:40 <Heffalump> but obviously I would take steps to make sure other people didn't duplicate my work
05:18:06 <goron> I suppose that when your project grows, a BTS will do this stuff.
05:18:15 <skew> shapr: That's an interesting idea.
05:19:01 <skew> I think if I was doing a lot of testing I would write something that continually runs the tests, and add a status indicator to my gkrellm/todo list/music player/IRC monitor
05:20:28 <shapr> Zero button testing, run the tests as soon as you save.
05:20:43 <shapr> hiya pesco
05:20:49 <pesco> Hi shapr!
05:22:49 * xerox waves
05:22:54 <pesco> I wonder if someone will use my versioning system!
05:23:13 <xerox> You are! :-)
05:23:21 <skew> From TMR? That sounds like a great idea
05:23:22 <pesco> Oh, right! :)
05:23:30 <pesco> skew: Cool!
05:23:51 * pesco curses his X11 installation.

05:24:31 <pesco> :/
05:25:37 <pesco> cptchaos: Woohoo, you made it. Do you want a hostname?
05:27:20 <lightstep> there was a tmr article about a vcs?

05:28:10 <pesco> lightstep: http://haskell.org/tmrwiki/EternalCompatibilityInTheory
05:28:56 <shapr> Has anyone seen a distributed hash function written in Haskell? Something like Chord or Kademlia?
05:29:07 <lightstep> oh. i didn't read it yet, but  i recall only a module system from the abstract
05:29:10 <pesco> What is a distributed hash function?
05:29:16 <shapr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table
05:30:02 <pesco> lightstep: Well, it's a protocol you can follow to make keep your modules eternally (backwards-)compatible.

05:34:45 <xerox> hah
05:38:33 <dons> doesn't John Meacham have a module versioning/checksummy thingo?
05:38:54 <dons> I seem to remember seeing arch-tags hashes in some of this code.. hmm.
05:38:55 <shapr> pesco: http://linuxjournal.com/article/6797
05:45:10 <goron> pesco: I read your article.
05:47:55 <lightstep> i thought debian (and other distros) do something similar wrt libraries
05:48:22 <pesco> goron: What do you think?
05:50:26 <pesco> shapr: Thanks.
05:50:56 <shapr> That linuxjournal article is a very clear and concise explanation of Kademlia.
05:53:04 <goron> pesco: I think it would be better if there was some mechanism (standard interface) to communicate to the users(you mean programmers, right?). Thus that someone could write a program to hook into ghc(or any hc) or something like that. And it seems you have to copy the module, this looks cumbersome. If you could integrate this idea with darcs, then there would be a possible application. Overall: it's good that you wrote this, because possible someone would p
05:53:14 <cptchaos> does anyone know how to give additional argument to the gcc when compiling via-C with ghc-6.4?
05:56:33 <goron> The standard interface instead of pragma's. (in case it wasn't clear).
05:58:08 <pesco> goron: Well, re. copying: There are two possibilities when moving to a new version. 1) Rename and replace old with re-export. 2) Rename and retain old as original copy. If you find either cumbersome, OK.
05:58:43 <pesco> goron: I'm not sure what you mean by "standard interface".
06:00:44 <pesco> WRT darcs, notice that my goal is discriminating _versions_, while darcs explicitly deals with _changes_.
06:03:20 <goron> pesco: You could see every patch as a different version. (it can also be the case that I still see darcs as a kind of distributed svn) and that in that case it doesn't work.
06:04:12 <goron> pesco: Now, you are using pragma's (i.e. text printed to stdout).
06:04:24 <goron> pesco: The good word for it is: convention.
06:05:58 <goron> pesco: Thus that there's structure in the stuff you want the user to know (for example your bug example(version 3.9 and 4.1) would be a good canditate).
06:06:01 <lightstep> so, should a cabal package include all the previous versions of the modules?
06:08:43 <pesco> lightstep: Yes.
06:09:19 <pesco> Many of them will be re-exports, remember.
06:10:13 <lightstep> so you only ever need the current version of cabal packages
06:10:23 <pesco> Correct.
06:10:23 <lightstep> what about renaming?
06:10:30 <pesco> What about it?
06:11:37 <pesco> goron: WRT darcs: There is no correspondence between states of a darcs repository and versions.
06:11:59 <lightstep> if readline is renamed to cmdlinetools, and gnu-readline is renamed to readline, you can't include old versions of readline any more
06:12:23 <pesco> goron: WRT convention: Establishing a convention is precisely what I'm aiming to do. Only I called it a protocol.
06:13:27 <pesco> lightstep: There is no problem, because you do not rename the old versions.
06:13:43 <goron> pesco: Ok, I never used darcs for development(only for pulling all stuff). Thanks for that.
06:13:56 <lightstep> but you have the old Readline_2 and the new Readline_2, which are not similar at all
06:13:57 <goron> pesco: I know you are building a convention.
06:14:07 <pesco> goron: Oh, I missed your point, sorry.
06:14:18 <dons> cptchaos: -optc-foo
06:14:21 <goron> pesco: I mean that at the level of information communicated to the user, there's no convention.
06:14:35 <cptchaos> dons: thanks
06:14:48 <goron> pesco: Any string can be thrown in a PRAGMA.
06:15:29 <pesco> goron: True, but why would you place junk in your pragma? After all, it's the module implementor's interest to make it clear to his users what to do.
06:15:53 <pesco> And the only information needed is "Import Foo_n."
06:16:09 <goron> pesco: That's true, but you could make it parseable.
06:16:21 <pesco> Ah. Hm...
06:16:30 <goron> pesco: I am not talking NLP ;)
06:16:42 <lightstep> or you could urge developers to put DON'T PANIC there
06:16:50 <goron> :)
06:16:54 <pesco> lightstep: Good suggestion! :)
06:17:16 <pesco> goron: NLP?
06:17:43 <lightstep> native language processing
06:17:44 <goron> pesco: Natural Language Processing.
06:17:50 * lightstep -> library
06:18:55 <goron> pesco: But that was the only remark I had on it.
06:19:27 <pesco> goron: Alright thanks. You could add it to the Feedback page if you like...
06:20:22 <goron> pesco: So binary support could work also this way?
06:20:59 <goron> (if ghc didn't break ABI everytime).
06:22:22 <goron> Your idea is also  quite similar to COM(Microsoft) interfaces. You might want to read about that sometime.
06:27:12 <skew> I like the idea of typing in a version number much better than typing in a GUID, though
06:29:04 <pesco> goron: Yes, binary support will be retained just as well, as long as the ABI is compatible (a fragile assumption *g*).
06:29:16 * pesco gets something to eat.
06:36:27 <goron> skew: :)
06:37:30 <sylvan> anyone wanna help me build wxwidgets (for use with wxHaskell)?
06:37:49 <sylvan> I get this error when running configure: checking if the C++ compiler requires -ext o... configure: error: cannot figure out if compiler needs -ext o: cannot compile
06:37:49 <sylvan> See `config.log' for more details.
06:38:24 <skew> that's pretty odd. What operating system are you running, and what C++ compiler is configure finding?
06:38:33 <sylvan> ubuntu linux
06:38:40 <sylvan> g++ apparently
06:38:52 <sylvan> which is weird
06:38:56 <sylvan> since it should use gcc
06:39:16 <sylvan> from config.log: configure:12568: checking if the C++ compiler requires -ext o
06:39:16 <sylvan> configure:12589: g++ -c   conftest.cc >&5
06:39:16 <sylvan> ../configure: line 12590: g++: command not found

06:39:16 <sylvan> configure:12605: error: cannot figure out if compiler needs -ext o: cannot compile
06:39:17 <sylvan> See `config.log' for more details.
06:39:42 <sylvan> so it looks like I need to tell it that g++ doesn't exist, but where?
06:47:32 <lightstep> sometime it's one of the options to configure. doesn't --help tell you how to specify the compiler?
06:47:42 <sylvan> I'll try
06:48:18 <Oejet> Hello, lightstep.
06:48:45 <lightstep> oh, hi
06:49:53 <Oejet> Are you through the paper yet?
06:52:46 <lightstep> which?
06:53:35 <Oejet> STM.
06:54:15 <lightstep> yes, except the implementation part. stm is really really great, and the paper is one of the only non-scary concurrency papers i've run into
06:55:03 <shapr> I think it's one of the only non-scary ways to do concurrency at all.
06:55:16 <lightstep> s/only/few/
06:55:30 <skew> shapr: that's what I was about to say.
06:55:39 <shapr> lightstep: Show me some others and I'll retract my only ;-)
06:56:42 <goron> shapr: There's Linda :)
06:56:45 <lightstep> i meant about my line: there are other non-scary _papers_, not non-scary _ideas_
06:59:37 <skew> I like the way it turns correctness problems into performance problems
07:00:01 <skew> Sort of like lazy evaluation and infinite objects
07:00:48 <shapr> Next we'll have CPU leaks.
07:01:34 <shapr> "Oh, you need to swap the order of those two STM calls, otherwise your computations only advance a step about once every five thousand retries."
07:02:43 <skew> shapr: the OS for those multi-core processors will demand those CPUs back eventually
07:02:46 <lightstep> there could be some built-in fairness
07:03:20 <sylvan> hmm... got it to work, thanks all
07:03:41 <skew> you know, page off the state and give it some some other process if the current owner hasn't actually used it for a while
07:03:52 <sylvan> (it helps to do "sudo ../configure" instead of just "../configure" :-)
07:04:00 <shapr> Or maybe it's all about quantum. "I spawned 60,000 STM computations, migrated them all to the same core, and then told them to vote each other off the CPU."
07:04:38 <skew> shapr: did you ever talk about Kinesis keyboards with somebody?
07:04:44 <shapr> Yes.
07:04:47 <cptchaos> hm does anyone know how to compare to unboxed floats ==# seems to be of type Int# -> Int# -> Bool
07:05:10 <skew> are you sure you really want to use equality on floats?
07:06:15 <cptchaos> hm good point acutally I only need <# but that has the same problem
07:07:07 <skew> If chip makers keep scaling by adding more cores I think we'll probably jump straight from 16 or so to thousands, because once we actually learn how to write code for them a few thousand tiny cores will be more efficient that a few P$-sized monsters
07:08:23 <Lemmih> cptchaos: Use two hashed for unboxed Doubles.
07:09:12 <cptchaos> Lemmit: thanks and for floats ? ... will change everything to double ...
07:10:05 <shapr> My recent prediction is lots of really small weak cores in a network on a die. Then you price the die according to the number of working unflawed cores. Right now, if a core is flawed, you trash the whole thing. I think the zillion core die will fix that.
07:10:59 <basti_> the only thing we need to find out is how to make computation practical on a zillion cores with nontrivial geometry hindrances
07:11:57 <shapr> I'm betting on declarative parallelism.
07:12:05 <skew> basti_: well, intel and AMD have gotten pretty good at running x86 machine code interpreters under pretty severe geometry constraints
07:12:31 <basti_> but that's a "single problem" solution
07:12:41 <basti_> as opposed to the required "all problems, algorithmically" solution
07:13:51 <shapr> The STI Cell has a neat trick where each sidekick CPU can pass data to the next directly. That way you can add a bunch more sidekick CPUs and the maximum wire length doesn't change.

07:15:03 <basti_> hm
07:15:13 <basti_> did anyone ever go "graphical programming" with haskell?
07:15:25 <Lemmih> There's also gtFloat# and ltFloat#.
07:15:38 <Lemmih> cptchaos: Why are you using unboxed Floats?
07:15:42 <shapr> I think so, but I can't remember the details.
07:15:58 <shapr> FunWorlds and Vital are vaguely in that direction.
07:16:06 <Lemmih> basti_: I've played a bit with OpenGL and SDL from Haskell.
07:16:22 <basti_> Lemmih: i didnt mean "programming your lammetta hardware"
07:16:26 <basti_> i was thinking like labview

07:17:11 <Lemmih> *lametta
07:17:25 <shapr> ohh
07:17:32 <basti_> vital looks cool.
07:20:44 <basti_> hmm i think I'm ready to give dons some new yi-emacs code.
07:30:09 <foxy_> is there a semantic function in parsec (to change the return value) so I could have: char 'a' <@ Asterix, where asterix is defined as data Mode = Asterix | ...
07:30:31 <foxy_> and thus the parser would be Parser Mode, not Parser Char
07:31:36 <skew> foxy_: it's just a monad. use >> and return
07:31:56 <lightstep> or liftM
07:32:53 <foxy_> ok, thanks
07:35:09 <Oejet> lightstep: I think STM is really powerful and elegant, but it's not easy to use for a motivated professional.
07:38:28 <skew> lightstep: how does liftM help replace the return value? liftM (const Asterix)?
07:44:10 <Heffalump> yes
07:50:34 <skew> Oejet: could you explain that a bit more?
07:51:54 <Oejet> skew: It was a subtle attempt at getting shapr to say, that we need a TMR article about it.
07:52:11 * shapr grins
07:52:40 <shapr> I try to recruit articles from people who want to write them.
07:52:48 <shapr> Oejet: Hey, want to write an STM article for TMR3?
07:53:15 <Oejet> shapr: Better with issue 4.
07:53:20 <shapr> Sounds good.
07:54:08 * Heffalump will write a TMR article about patch theory, once I understand it myself.
07:54:15 <shapr> Cool.

07:54:32 <shapr> hiya benmos, looking for Haskell info?
07:54:45 <Oejet> But seriously, I've been trying to write some STM data structures which could go into the standard library, but it's quite hard.  Maybe I'm just not concetrating enough.
07:55:00 <benmos> Hi - just checking out what's going on - no specific questions yet!
07:55:11 <Lemmih> Oejet: What data structures?
07:55:18 <shapr> benmos: Ok, if you have specific questionsor want the short intro, feel free to ask.
07:55:28 <benmos> thx
07:56:09 <benmos> (don't worry I won't ask what a Monad is ;-)
07:56:28 <Oejet> Lemmih: I was starting with a binary tree with finegrained mutual exclusion.
07:56:34 <goron> benmos: shapr is the automated tourguide of Haskell. He's quite advanced.
07:56:38 <shapr> :-P
07:56:39 <lightstep> i recall the Synthesis paper - it had some STM
07:56:58 <lightstep> or equivalent stuff, it didn't say "transaction"
07:57:14 <Oejet> lightstep: Do you have a more specific title?
07:57:22 <lightstep> no, but will have in a moment

08:09:33 <vdrab> hi #haskell....
08:10:02 <vdrab> Just went through the second TMR, it looks neat. I just can't get the Haskore module working...
08:10:20 * lightstep read "hi" as "vi"
08:10:59 <vdrab> the new IOExtensions.hs files imports a module called IOExts, and it's not on my system it seems
08:11:12 <vdrab> anyone encountered something similar?
08:11:19 * skew guesses emacs #haskell would open up the channel
08:11:45 <skew> did that go away in 6.4?
08:11:47 <vdrab> hehe
08:12:23 <vdrab> ah, could it be a version problem? I'm on GHC 6.2.2
08:12:30 <vdrab> that would suck
08:12:35 <basti_> vdrab: hi!
08:12:49 <vdrab> hello basti_
08:13:10 <basti_> there is a IOExts.hs file somewhere in that .tar.gz
08:13:14 <vdrab> would you be the basti_ from the arctile?
08:13:19 <basti_> you could also use hugs
08:13:19 <basti_> yes
08:13:20 <vdrab> article
08:13:34 <basti_> thats me
08:13:48 <vdrab> cool... i've been wanting to have a look at haskore, but the project seemed deader than dead for the longest time
08:13:57 <basti_> there is some activity.
08:14:02 <basti_> but it's not stable yet
08:14:25 <vdrab> IOExts.hs in the file? really? i just extracted the whole thing to a directory.
08:14:30 <vdrab> let me have another look
08:14:43 <basti_> its hidden somewhere
08:14:52 <basti_> (/ghc or something)
08:15:02 <basti_> i think for the explicit purpose of not getting in the way
08:18:04 <basti_> ghc_add
08:18:12 <vdrab> can't find it. nor can ghci
08:18:21 <vdrab> where is it supposed to be?
08:18:30 <basti_> Haskore/ghc_add/IOExtensions.hs
08:18:35 <basti_> now i'm wondering about the different name
08:18:55 <vdrab> I have that one, but it imports a file called IOExts.hs, and that import fails
08:19:05 <basti_> ahhh.
08:19:27 <vdrab> is it a system module from later than 6.2.2?
08:19:37 <basti_> i do not think so
08:19:43 <vdrab> weird
08:19:55 <basti_> but i get the same error
08:19:59 <vdrab> hehe
08:20:15 <basti_> Could not find module `IOExts':
08:20:15 <basti_>   it is a member of package lang-1.0, which is hidden
08:20:48 <basti_> add -package lang
08:20:57 <basti_> to your ghc command
08:21:10 <basti_> do NOT wonder about the load of warnings.
08:21:10 <basti_> ;)
08:21:30 <vdrab> let's see
08:23:23 <vdrab> what's that about warnings? ;-)
08:23:54 <vdrab> ok, that seems to have done the trick
08:23:58 <vdrab> thanks a lot
08:24:27 <basti_> -g-
08:24:40 <vdrab> now, time to have that long-overdue first encounter with haskore
08:24:41 <vdrab> cheers
08:24:45 <basti_> i dont know how to fix the warnings
08:24:51 <vdrab> that's fine
08:24:56 <basti_> any feedback on the article?
08:25:06 <vdrab> i'm about to read it :-)
08:25:12 <basti_> i see
08:25:58 <vdrab> looks exciting enough though....

08:56:13 <Marios> hi im writing a parser in haskell.., right now im working out what type different expressions have, for example the expression "hello" is a String, and im tryin to figure out if there is such thing as constraint expressions and what the type of these will be, any ideas, thanx
08:56:51 <Marios> i.e if we can give a type to : Eq a => a
08:57:08 <Heffalump> that is a type.
08:57:35 <Marios> yes i know what i was thinking is to have something like Eq a => some number
08:57:45 <Marios> then say that is a type Int
08:57:51 <Marios> not sure if its right
08:59:29 <lightstep> http://haskell.org/onlinereport/index.html#sect9.5  <- see gendecl
09:02:20 <Marios> hmm i cant think of a way that an expression with a constraint type can be written
09:02:50 <lightstep> (read "8")::(Num a=>a)
09:03:03 <lightstep> what is that good for?
09:04:31 <basti_> uhm for telling your env that what you want to read is a number.
09:05:33 <basti_> ah that was an answer in itself ok
09:05:33 <basti_> ;)
09:08:53 <Marios> i have a function to get the type of expressions, for example findType "5" returns Int and im not sure if i can do the same with expressions that have constraint type
09:11:47 <basti_> uhm
09:12:02 <basti_> how can a an expression return a type?
09:12:23 <dcoutts> does anyone know of any cabalised libs/progs out there that are ready to be packaged for a distro? Over in Gentoo land we're testing our cabal support and are looking for things to package up. We've got only hxt-5.0 so far. Suggestions?
09:12:56 <Lemmih> Cabal is cabalized.
09:13:38 <cptchaos> Marios: is that really what you want, since the constrains like C a => a only say the type a is in Class C ..
09:14:04 <cptchaos> and that Class could be seen as a set of types

09:15:43 <Heffalump> sorry, that's the debian package name (which I'm just working on now)
09:16:17 <Heffalump> but Bjorn Bringert's HTTP client library - darcs pull it from his site, but don't pull the May 5th patches, cos those introduce dependencies on other stuff, including indirectly one thing that isn't freely distributable
09:17:02 <Marios> thank you
09:17:45 <Marios> ill do that cptchaos
09:19:03 <dcoutts> Heffalump, haskell-http, we're talking about http://www.haskell.org/http/ right?
09:19:47 <Heffalump> yes
09:20:02 <Igloo> dcoutts: Do you have something cunning to make an e-build(?) from a .cabal?
09:20:44 <dcoutts> Igloo, not yet but we may make one, the main thing is getting the amount of info and hackery in the atual ebuild to a minimum
09:21:06 <dcoutts> Igloo, do you have any other cabal packages yet?
09:21:53 <Igloo> That depends what you mean by "you" and "other"  :-)
09:22:52 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/cabal/lcs/ is the only cabal package I've personally made, I think
09:23:00 <dcoutts> Igloo, well you being any of you debian folk, cabalised packages in experimental or merely planning phase
09:23:48 <dcoutts> lsc, I see, nice.
09:27:31 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I got a fair deal of (unofficial) Cabal packages at http://haskell.galois.com/cgi-bin/hackage and http://scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/packages/
09:32:24 <dcoutts> Lemmih, thank's I'll check it out
10:23:58 <Lunar^> Waow, Hoogle is cool
10:51:04 <Lemmih> http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/7/111852/2129
10:51:13 <Lemmih> Sorry.
10:52:33 <sylvan> Okay, so I've installed wxHaskell under linux, how do I get ghc to notice it?
10:52:48 <sylvan> (on windows there was a nifty little script)
10:53:32 <Gahhh> there must be a package path flag
10:53:47 <sylvan> should I do something with ghc-pkg or something?
10:53:52 <Heffalump> which ghc?
10:53:57 <sylvan> 6.4
10:54:06 * Heffalump isn't sure then, things have changed since 6.2
10:54:17 <sylvan> ok, I'll try to work it out
10:54:35 <Heffalump> but it is essentially a question of telling GHC it exists
10:54:52 <Heffalump> by running ghc-pkg or some new equivalent on an appropriate package configuration file for wxHaskell.
10:54:58 <Heffalump> If you used cabal, that should know how to do it for you.
10:55:32 <sylvan> doesn't seem to be cabal'd
10:58:05 <kolmodin> darcs doesn't work with ghc 6.4?
10:58:05 <sylvan> did a ghc-pkg register on them.. seemed to work.. will build a sample..
11:00:05 <sylvan> yay it worked!
11:00:50 <Igloo> kolmodin: 1.0.3RC1 should
11:01:24 <kolmodin> Igloo: ok, thanks!
11:22:41 <cognominal> hi, why the name "impredicative" to qualify "higher rank" systems?
11:45:03 <glimming> Hum Hum
11:45:06 <glimming> I am trying to compose monads
11:45:22 <glimming> And there is a theorem stating that if there is a distributive law ST -> TS for monads S,T
11:45:25 <glimming> then ST is a monad
11:46:30 <ski> um
11:46:55 <glimming> oops TS sorry
11:47:14 <ski> ST is S . T ?
11:47:16 <glimming> But the notion of distributive law is a bit involved and goes all the way back to Beck
11:47:19 <glimming> Yepp
11:47:41 <glimming> First the distributive law is AFAICT a polymorphic fucntion
11:47:45 <glimming> delta:ST -> TS
11:47:52 <ski> the "usual" way to compose monads is with monad transformers, fwik
11:48:19 <glimming> There are four additional properties that must hold for delta to be a dist law.
11:48:22 <glimming> YES.
11:48:36 <Heffalump> There's a paper about doing it a different way, but I remember talking to one of the authors of that to figure out if it was any use for Haskell monads and concluding that it wasn't.
11:48:41 <Heffalump> Can't remember why, though.
11:48:41 <glimming> But this is pre-monad transformers -- this is probably the motivation for them, that it is hard to compose monads.
11:49:13 <glimming> using .
11:49:24 <glimming> Hum hum.
11:49:34 <glimming> There are four laws for a distributive law delta:
11:51:09 <glimming> delta . T eta_S = eta_S . T
11:51:45 <glimming> delta . eta_T S = S eta_T
11:51:52 <glimming> and for mu
11:52:14 <glimming> delta . T mu_S = mu_S T . S delta . delta S
11:52:45 <glimming> delta . mu_T S = S mu_T . delta T. T delta
11:52:46 <glimming> that's it.
11:53:05 <glimming> where (S,mu,eta) and (T,mu,eta) are two monads
11:53:13 <glimming> If this holds one is supposed to be able to prove
11:53:17 <glimming> that ST is a monad as well.
11:53:25 <glimming> I'd like to formalise this in Haskell using the Monad class.
11:53:33 <glimming> First, I need to move to Kleisli presentation
11:53:41 <glimming> and for that I think I need a beer
11:53:43 <glimming> bear
11:53:45 <glimming> whichever
11:54:49 <glimming> So the laws must be translated
11:55:04 <glimming> This should be rather easy since it is immediate how to give mu and eta from >>= and return
11:55:23 <glimming> But I can't remember, anyone?
11:55:38 <ski> delta is iso, yes ?
11:55:57 * ski draws diagram of laws
11:56:00 <glimming> I doubt it, it is a natural transformation and not a natural ismorphism in general afaik
11:56:09 <ski> k
11:56:17 <glimming> For first diagram draw objects T   TS ST
11:56:20 <glimming> for second S TS ST
11:56:31 <glimming> third TSS STS SST \n TS ST
11:56:32 <ski> so it's one-way distributoin ?
11:56:36 <glimming> and then
11:56:46 <glimming> TTS  TST STT
11:56:47 <glimming> TS ST
11:56:49 <glimming> I suppose so
11:56:57 <glimming> Yes it is.
11:57:02 <glimming> Good point.
11:58:03 <glimming> swedish ski?
11:59:21 <ski> yes
11:59:50 <glimming> Chalemrs?
11:59:56 <ski> yes
11:59:57 <glimming> Anyone I know?
12:00:03 <ski> not that i know
12:01:12 * ski not done with pics yet
12:02:41 <ski> hm
12:02:56 <ski> shouldn't delta : T . S -> S . T  ?
12:04:07 <glimming> In Haskell I beleive
12:04:30 <glimming> delta:: S (T a) -> T (S a)
12:04:34 <glimming> polymorphic function = natural transformation
12:04:43 <ski> yes
12:04:56 <glimming> (how do I write composition on type constructors  in Haskell?)
12:05:04 <glimming> (can we use . inside type expressions?)=
12:05:28 <ski> but T (eta_S A) : T A -> T (S A)
12:06:15 <ski> glimming : haskell has no composition defined on type constructors (one can define an isomorphic type constructor, though)
12:06:31 <ski> you can just informally write  T . S
12:06:39 <glimming> or go with pointwise
12:07:04 <earthy> glimming: want a kleisli class?
12:07:15 <glimming> There is one... it's called Monad!
12:07:15 <ski> (or you can define  newtype Comp f g a = MkC (f (g a)),  and then write Comp T S)
12:07:23 <glimming> (for earthy)
12:07:33 <earthy> instance (Functor m, Monad m) => Triple m where
12:07:33 <earthy>   eta       = return
12:07:33 <earthy>   etaInv x  = trace "+++ Warning: etaInv Monad"
12:07:33 <earthy>               Nothing -- Can't say anything here
12:07:33 <earthy>   mu x      = x >>= id
12:07:36 <earthy> that? :)
12:07:45 <glimming> I think you have the monoid form here
12:07:51 <glimming> Can someone confirm?
12:08:02 <earthy> this is the monad form
12:08:11 <glimming> indeed
12:08:12 <glimming> thanks
12:08:16 <earthy> the Monad class in haskell actually has the kleisli form
12:08:24 <ski> earthy : etaInv ?
12:08:26 <glimming> preciseamento, many thanks
12:08:45 * earthy has been playing with coproducts of monads as per the icfp2002 paper
12:09:24 <glimming> earthy aka Leeuwen did you give a course in AFP and I mailed you before or do I mix up persons>?
12:09:30 <glimming> ski, back to topic...
12:09:47 <glimming> T (eta_S A) : T A -> T (S A)
12:09:47 <earthy> I did not give a course in AFP
12:09:54 <glimming> I am a bit lost here when we compose natural transformations with functors.
12:10:01 <glimming> Your name rings a bell
12:10:10 <earthy> I did HC&AR once
12:10:51 <Heffalump> earthy: did you get anywhere?
12:10:53 <glimming> related http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Research/fop/swansea.pdf
12:10:53 <earthy> ski: etaInv is unnecessary
12:11:12 <ski> i was thinking, if we want to do   delta A . T (eta_S A),  then  delta A : T (S A) -> S (T A)
12:11:17 <earthy> (it is used in the coproduct construction)
12:11:34 <glimming>   can everyone be silent for a while so that I can think? ;-)))
12:12:16 * ski was thinking something along that line
12:12:42 <ski> glimming : or if other want to talk, we could of course go otherwise ..
12:13:11 <glimming> new channel #AFP
12:13:14 <earthy> one question: you *have* read the icfp 2002 paper right? Neil Ghani was one of the co-authors. :)
12:13:17 <earthy> IIRC
12:13:27 <glimming> ;-))
12:13:29 <glimming> Nope
12:13:35 <ski> (glimming : btw, i'm a little bit tired now, so i can't think too fast)
12:13:44 <earthy> `ah' ;)
12:14:01 <ski> earthy : it was the one about combining monads by coproducts, right ?
12:14:13 <glimming> Now #AFP
12:14:37 <earthy> ski: exactly
12:14:46 <earthy> great stuff, that
12:15:11 <earthy> (though the paper is not really easy to understand)
12:21:09 * ski has only skimmed the paper
12:45:14 <cptchaos> w00t
12:45:36 <cptchaos> got sse2 otimisation for my matrixmultiplication in haskell with ghc
12:47:57 <Heffalump> cptchaos: nice, how?
12:49:10 <mflux> how does the function's code look like?
12:50:20 <cptchaos> at the core I have implemented a matrix type using marshaled arrays
12:51:39 <basti_> glimming: im reading that swansea.pdf paper.
12:51:40 <cptchaos> since I know (or expect) numeric to be sideeffect free I can unwrap that later with unsafePerformIO
12:52:31 <Heffalump> ah, so you're manually vectorising?
12:52:46 <cptchaos> Heffalump
12:52:49 <cptchaos> no
12:53:41 <cptchaos> I have then compiled it with the folowing cmd
12:53:44 <cptchaos> ghc -O3 --make -funfolding-update-in-place  -fglasgow-exts Test.hs -o test -optc-march=pentium3 -optc-mfpmath=sse,387 -optc-ffast-math -optc-fmove-all-movables -optc-fprefetch-loop-arrays -optc-fssa -optc-fssa-dce -optc-msse2
12:54:40 <Heffalump> you're using gcc auto-vectorisation?
12:54:41 <reffie> heeeh
12:54:54 <reffie> are you a gentoo user
12:55:22 <cptchaos> where the fpmath=sse,387 , prefetch-loop-array and msse two options are most importend
12:55:38 <cptchaos> and I guess they speed up the memorymanagemet a lot
12:55:44 <cptchaos> reffie: yes
12:55:50 <reffie> clearly.
12:57:25 <cptchaos> so I have a Loop multiplication a 10x10 matrix 10000 with it self, each multiplication must allocte a result matrix
12:58:56 <cptchaos> if I breake it and omit the alloaction I get a runtime of the test of about 2 seconds (with memory allocation about 5 seconds)
12:59:39 <cptchaos> adding the three options above fires it back to about 2 seconds (but with creating new heap stuff).
12:59:39 <dbremner> cptchaos - have you looked at acovea?
12:59:54 <cptchaos> dbremner: no, what is that?
13:00:02 * cptchaos *googles*
13:00:25 <dbremner> @google acovea
13:00:27 <SyntaxNinja> y0
13:00:27 <lambdabot> http://www.coyotegulch.com/products/acovea/
13:00:56 * cptchaos *reads the abstract*
13:02:23 <cptchaos> I tried to wirte the same in C to compare speeds ...
13:03:22 <cptchaos> but I am not capable of writing valid c-code anymore, so I gave up. However I think it is fast ...
13:04:35 <dbremner> cptchaos - that's one of the reasons code in HLLs tends to be faster. It's a lot easier to make a shorter program faster.
13:06:48 <cptchaos> dbremner: and it is a lot easier to make a shorter program near to correct
13:08:02 <dbremner> cptchaos - when Interlisp was rewritten in Lisp, the resulting version was faster than the previous version in assembly.
13:09:36 <cptchaos> hu, did not know that, but I was missing a fast linear algebra library in haskell. I guess I can use that design to make one
13:10:28 <cptchaos> need that for University, just because I don't want to code in mathlab ...
13:10:51 * basti_ coughs
13:15:26 <xyzp> I wish I could read several things in parallel.
13:15:57 <xyzp> Someone invent a better human.
13:16:03 <xyzp> Snap snap.
13:16:28 <cptchaos> hm, hard , but  ... ;-)
13:17:01 <Gahhh> xyzp: it all depends on our reproduction scheme. it only it favored reading skills.
13:17:13 <Gahhh> it only = if only. typing is also good.
13:18:32 <xyzp> Improving humans through selective breeding would take too long.
13:19:04 <Heffalump> and the trend is probably the other way, since less educated people tend to breed more
13:19:15 <xyzp> I'm not Leto II, I don't think I have that long.
13:19:20 <Gahhh> xyzp: it's been working for the last million years or so methinks. no need to rush.
13:19:35 <Oejet> xyzp: Yes, we need to extinct the weak and faithless so that man has the best environment to flurish.
13:19:45 <xyzp> Never leave to chance what you can do half-assed in a fraction of the time.
13:19:48 * Oejet goes back to reading Main Kampf.
13:19:56 <Oejet> *Mein
13:20:22 <xyzp> That's an inefficient means of genetic engineering.
13:20:31 <Gahhh> well, if it doesn't happen, it's not like we owed another "entity" a certain quality in humans...
13:20:58 <xyzp> I want it.
13:21:04 <Oejet> Gahhh: You mean we got it for free?
13:21:05 <xyzp> I don't care about space pixies.
13:22:06 <Gahhh> Oejet: I am just saying that we don't have an absolute level we *have* to reach. We could choose to be total morons from now. What difference does that make.
13:22:46 <xyzp> Yes, well, the heat death of the universe makes practically everything pointless in any grand scale of things.
13:22:50 <basti_> are you talking about darwinian programming?
13:23:14 <Oejet> Gahhh: My grand mother would be very dissapointed in me.
13:23:44 <xyzp> However I still find myself desiring to exist and do things, and that's as much of a benchmark as any.
13:23:54 <xyzp> So create for me a better human.
13:24:00 <xyzp> Quickly.
13:24:05 <Gahhh> xyzp: everything is pointless imho. individuals have certain tendencies (like making grandma happy), but it's not really "absolutely correct".
13:24:07 <xyzp> I may only have another 70 years left!
13:24:30 <xyzp> Absolutely correct is a silly notion.
13:24:30 <basti_> oh theres an easy way
13:24:36 <basti_> teach him haskell.
13:24:38 <basti_> :)
13:24:39 <Gahhh> xyzp: do you want me to make *you* better, or do you want me to create a better human for you ?
13:24:51 <xyzp> Well first I want you to construct a prototype.
13:24:58 <basti_> i thought most men would be happy with the perfect woman
13:25:01 <xyzp> Then we can work on retrofitting me with improvements.
13:25:23 <Gahhh> basti_: yes, some may require 2 perfect women to be truly happy.
13:25:27 <xyzp> Experimenting on me is perhaps not the best course of action.
13:25:34 <xyzp> There being only one of me and all.
13:25:48 <basti_> well if you were able to make ONE perfect woman, there certainly would be the possibility of creating more
13:26:09 <xyzp> Well perfect is about as silly a notion as absolutely correct.
13:26:09 <basti_> besides, when you're done with the task, you're old and they're still young, then it's even more fun
13:26:23 <Gahhh> basti_: unless the existence requirement for a perfect woman is the absence of another perfect woman.
13:26:42 <basti_> hmmmm
13:26:45 <basti_> thats right
13:26:48 <basti_> that would make it difficult
13:27:18 <xyzp> What would be the point of multiple perfect women?
13:27:31 <Heffalump> perfect might imply monogamous.
13:27:51 <xyzp> If one is perfect then it cannot be improved upon by the addition of another, can it?
13:27:57 <xyzp> Ah, the fun of superlatives.
13:28:12 * Oejet has got lazy decompression of Bzip2 files working.
13:28:20 <cptchaos> I am at least sure, that the requirement for the existence of the perfectest woman is the absence of an other perfectest woman .
13:28:21 <xyzp> Now that's useful.
13:28:22 <Heffalump> just because one perfect diamond exists doesn't mean we don't want multiple ones
13:28:25 <Gahhh> xyzp: this is not orange juice, though. You can have two glasses and it tastes different.
13:28:31 <Trevion> Heffalump's got it.
13:28:39 <xyzp> Much unlike perfect people and my lamentations of my limitations.
13:28:55 * basti_ sees he caused chaos
13:29:11 <Gahhh> basti_: no, this is on some way related to monads, I am sure.
13:29:24 <xyzp> What exactly do you mean by a perfect diamond?
13:29:30 <basti_> "perfect" might make a quantifier
13:29:32 <xyzp> Merely that it lacks impurities?
13:29:40 <basti_> and then might be expressed in cat theory
13:29:44 <xyzp> What if the perfect diamond was to mean the most valuable diamond possible?
13:30:00 <Gahhh> xyzp: two things may have equal value.
13:30:05 <xyzp> Or maybe the diamond that completes you such that you need nothing else?
13:30:13 <basti_> diamonds are collectors items
13:30:24 <xyzp> Not if my definition of perfection is a nice subjective "best."
13:30:28 <basti_> thats why yours are always worth nothing while you paid lots for them
13:30:33 <Heffalump> I think you're implying properties that can't possibly be true of any diamond.
13:30:50 <Oejet> basti_: And rotation saw material.
13:30:58 <Heffalump> There is no diamond that completes you such that you need nothing else.
13:30:58 <basti_> now we're slipping into the realms of philosophy
13:31:10 <basti_> well yes, but the splinters you put on saws are cheap.
13:31:11 <Gahhh> xyzp: Now you are assuming that you are the x-axis and the diamon is the y-axis and it completes you as such. It is merely orthogonal, and you can have another diamond in the x-axis ! :)
13:31:14 <xyzp> Just that perfect one.
13:31:15 <basti_> of course, because people need lots
13:31:15 <Heffalump> And since my girlfriend can't see what I'm typing, I assert that the same applies to women.
13:31:26 <Gahhh> I meant the z-axis
13:31:29 <Gahhh> I cannot ype
13:31:31 <Gahhh> qed
13:32:00 <basti_> i imagine a plane piece of steel in the x/y axis and a diamond tipped drill drilling z-wise
13:32:11 <basti_> we will NOT extend this to women in ANY way now.
13:32:30 <Gahhh> ok. happy mother's day all.
13:32:35 <xyzp> Haha.
13:32:39 <Heffalump> it's not mother's day.
13:32:47 <xyzp> It is here.
13:32:48 <Gahhh> it's in the US. sorry
13:32:53 <xyzp> As well as my birthday.
13:33:07 <xyzp> If I were a mother than I would win twice as much.
13:33:07 <Heffalump> xyzp: does your birthday move to March when you visit Europe? :-)
13:33:20 <Gahhh> ooh. that makes you what, a taurus ? (/me chuckles in delirium)
13:33:22 <xyzp> I hope so.
13:33:33 <xyzp> Beats me.
13:33:43 <Heffalump> quick, someone get xyzp pregnant!
13:33:50 <xyzp> I know more about hockey than I do astrology.
13:33:56 <Gahhh> Heffalump: I am still working on the prototype.
13:34:03 <Heffalump> (/me seeks upwards for clues as to whether that's anatomically possible)
13:34:14 <dbremner> there's the old joke about Helen of Troy who was so beautiful that her face launched a thousand ships. From this, we get millihelens as a unit of beauty. ;-)
13:34:16 <basti_> astrology?
13:34:18 <Gahhh> Heffalump: It will be when I am done with the prototype :)
13:34:45 <xyzp> I think I might miss my parts.
13:34:50 <dbremner> there's the old joke about Helen of Troy who was so beautiful that her face launched a thousand ships. From this, we get millihelens as a unit of beauty. ;-)
13:34:59 <Gahhh> dbremner: you dont say...
13:35:01 <xyzp> I'm rescinding my request for improvement.
13:35:31 <Gahhh> go comcast, eh
13:36:48 <xyzp> I rather miss broadband at the homestead.
13:37:00 <xyzp> Even substandard broadband.
13:38:14 <xyzp> I made the suboptimal decision to drop my cable provider due to its inadequate reliability and the relatively short period of time in which I'll be here.
13:38:29 <Gahhh> school ?
13:38:49 <xyzp> No, just moving with my girlfriend.
13:39:02 <xyzp> Well, school for her I suppose.
13:39:13 <xyzp> Seeing as she has the notion that she wants to be a doctor.
13:39:23 <Gahhh> best of luck
13:39:24 <xyzp> Silly, really. There are much better subjects.
13:39:26 <xyzp> ;)
13:40:00 <earthy> actually, medicine is somewhat interesting
13:40:11 <xyzp> Haha.
13:40:14 <xyzp> I'm sure.
13:40:29 <earthy> unfortunately, though the systems under study are nicely complex and interesting, they're nowhere near deterministic
13:40:33 <xyzp> Are you attempting to deflate my hubris with reason?
13:40:44 <earthy> which makes it kinda hard to do anything reasonable with it. :)
13:40:48 <dbremner> earthy - all real problems are nondeterministic.
13:41:13 <basti_> oh i bet the study objects of medicine will turn out to be pretty deterministic
13:41:25 <basti_> they just didn't explore them very far yet
13:41:37 <earthy> dbremner: true. but there's a ballpark in which you can reason with the nondeterminism... medicine isn't in that ballpark
13:42:47 <earthy> (at least, from what I gather from the doctor-friends I have, and from what my gf (who works in registration of pharmaceutics) tells me)
13:43:29 <xyzp> I've always much preferred abstract things than tangibles.
13:43:33 <xyzp> "to"
13:43:52 <earthy> you don't see the beauty in a nicely browned steak, then? :)
13:44:01 <lispy> trying to get good runtime data on pollard rho is hard.  It will zip along talking almost zero time for most numbers, then it will hit one it can't factor (and i've removed all psuedoprimes) and take like an hour
13:44:10 <xyzp> Well actually I'm going to depart in a short while to grill steaks.
13:44:10 <earthy> (cooking is the one nondeterministic thing I do love ;))
13:44:41 <xyzp> I don't see them as beautiful as such, though I do find them pleasant.
13:44:55 <earthy> ;)
13:44:56 <xyzp> I think more intricate items are more visually impressive.
13:45:12 <earthy> may be
13:45:14 <earthy> may well be
13:45:37 <earthy> but I'll have to hand it to you, even though I've had a great meal, you just made my mouth water
13:45:41 <earthy> hmmm. grilled steaks. ;)
13:46:10 <xyzp> Now you're just tormenting me.
13:46:21 <xyzp> Haha.
13:46:32 <earthy> well, *you* get to eat them
13:46:47 <earthy> (outdoors, even? damn, I'm jealous)
13:46:47 <xyzp> Some subset of them, at least.
13:46:52 <xyzp> Yes.
13:47:25 <xyzp> As soon as the others arrive.
13:47:30 <lispy> well,i get to eat a subset too...
13:47:31 <earthy> oh heck. fortunately the weather isn't good enough yet, or else I really would have lamented not having a grill yet ;)
13:47:42 <lispy> unfortunately my subset is not proper :)
13:47:51 * earthy lauhgs
13:47:55 <earthy> laughs, even
13:48:05 <xyzp> Hands off my steaks, lispy.
13:50:14 <xyzp> I suppose I should just start early.
13:51:30 <thelsdj> hey, i'm just teaching myself haskell and trying to get the hang of custom data types and trying to write a fold function for a tree, heres the code: http://rafb.net/paste/results/uFW3tQ76.html my problem is it works for something like treeFold (+) 0 someTree but doesn't work for creating a list using treeFold (:) [] someTree, any ideas on how to rework it?
13:51:44 <dbremner> xyzp - time is an illusion, steak time doubly so.
13:52:22 <cptchaos> Heffalump:  the lowest options to get the autovectorisation of the gcc working with ghc is:  -O1 -fglasgow-exts -o test -optc-mfpmath=sse,387 -optc-msse2
13:52:53 <Cale> thelsdj: You might do well to write a type signature for treeFold
13:53:01 <Cale> (before actually writing it)
13:53:17 <Heffalump> cptchaos: interesting
13:53:59 <pediddle> thelsdj: check out the base case, which would be (f [] x)... []:x probably doesn't make sense
13:54:17 <cptchaos> Heffalump: maybe it is useful for other sources as well, don't know
13:54:29 <thelsdj> pediddle: ha yea thats probably it, doh, and will write type signature
13:54:48 <cptchaos> Heffalump: are you a GHC hacker?
13:55:24 <Heffalump> cptchaos: nope
13:55:48 <cptchaos> Heffalump: ah, ok
13:57:25 <cptchaos> you may remove the -o test from the options ... ;-)
13:57:31 <cptchaos> hrm
14:00:27 <Heffalump> anyone know about problems with ghci on Tiger (MacOS 10.whateveritis)?
14:01:01 <Heffalump> In particular to help with the problem stated in http://www.livejournal.com/users/fivemack/55549.html?nc=2
14:03:27 <Gahhh> 10.4
14:05:10 <pediddle> thelsdj: if you just switch the order of f's parameters in both places, it works
14:05:22 <pediddle> you probably already tried that by now...
14:05:48 <thelsdj> pediddle: yup figured that out, and i learned type signature is a good thing cause when i put in what i knew the type signature shoudl be it wouldn't compile so knew something was wrong :)
14:06:00 <pediddle> yup
14:09:30 <pediddle> Heffalump: i've had problems with GHC 6.4 on Tiger... can't seem to compile my own GHC, and other things break
14:09:40 <lispy> log(ab) = log(a) + log(b), so that means if i multiply two k bit numbers, the result is a 2k bit number?
14:10:03 * boegel is tired and drags himself to bed
14:10:11 <pediddle> lispy: yes, potentially
14:10:14 <earthy> lispy: technically, yes
14:10:41 <tromp> 2k or 2k-1
14:11:03 <lispy> thanks
14:11:18 <wagle> people at galois were having the same tiger/ghc64 problem last week.  it should be solved soon, if not already.  8)
14:30:39 <hellish> what's the use of ($)? f $ x = f x, so why  wouldn't one just use f x?
14:31:15 <pediddle> hellish: $ is left-associative and binds very loosely, so it lets you avoid typing lots of parentheses
14:31:15 <lightstep> ($) has low priority, it might save parentheses
14:31:16 <integral> $ has a different precedence to juxtaposition
14:31:40 <lispy> hellish: the other day when i told you that unsafePerformIO was giving me weirdness i was wrong.  Turned out to be a different bug.
14:31:43 <Heffalump> f $ g $ h x = f (g (h x))
14:31:50 <Heffalump> it's right-associative, not left-associative
14:32:21 <hellish> Ah. That's cool. It's just syntactic sugar for functional application then?
14:32:28 <pediddle> it also lets you do something like (map ($ x)) to apply a list of functions to a value x
14:32:43 <lispy> pediddle: now that's a cooluse
14:32:52 <Heffalump> hellish: not even syntactic sugar, since its definition is entirely within the language.
14:33:07 <lispy> @type ($)
14:33:09 <pediddle> Heffalump: oops, you're right
14:33:09 <lightstep> but it's not necessary: ($ x) = (flip id x) = (`id` x)
14:33:12 <lambdabot> ($) :: forall b a. (a -> b) -> a -> b
14:33:39 <lightstep> also, ($) isn't polymorphic enough
14:34:13 <hellish> and (.) is the same with different precedence?
14:34:35 <lightstep> no, that's compisition
14:34:36 <lispy> (f . g) x = f (g x)
14:35:14 <lispy> but i guess that f $ g x = f (g x)
14:35:18 <lispy> so i could see where they overlap
14:36:09 <lightstep> interestingly, your first equation is even a legal definition of (.)
14:36:42 <hellish> so (.) takes two functions are returns another function which is their composition?
14:36:44 <wagle> $ seems best when an expression gets broken across more than one line, and the paren-matching becomes hard to see.
14:36:49 <lispy> lightstep: i love that about haskell
14:37:14 <lightstep> hellish, precisely
14:41:03 <goron> What OS are you running (because it seems impossible to find a distro that has source and binary support). Gentoo has no real binary support.
14:41:38 <Cale> hm? Doesn't Debian have source and binary support?
14:42:11 <goron> Cale: They always say they have, but since nobody uses it, I don't think there's much QA.
14:42:23 <goron> Cale: But I might be wrong.
14:42:24 <mugwump> apt-get source --build iuseitallthetime
14:42:36 <hellish> goron: I use it.
14:42:39 <goron> mugwump: Ow, and no library breakage?
14:42:56 <goron> I am now using FreeBSD. It's a disaster.
14:43:18 <mugwump> well, I only compile when I have to.  but that generally works well
14:44:01 <mugwump> some maintainers are really slack about making sure their package builds correctly like that, you're right that there is little QA on this
14:44:44 <Heffalump> the autobuilders fall over and die if a package FTBFS
14:44:51 <Heffalump> and it's a release critical bug
14:45:05 <Heffalump> so I would say there is quite a lot of QA on that subject
14:45:14 <goron> Fail To Build ??  ??
14:45:20 <Heffalump> Fails to Build From Source
14:45:41 <goron> Heffalump: Ok. That's nice to hear.
14:45:55 <goron> Heffalump: And what about kde3.4 support?
14:46:07 <goron> Heffalump: It wasn't in Unstable.
14:46:10 <Heffalump> and you should certainly report a bug if you have build-essential installed and the build-deps of a package and it still fails to build
14:46:19 <Heffalump> now, uptodateness I can't help with :-)
14:47:11 <goron> Heffalump: Using stuff from experimental and Unstable at the same time is not supported, right?
14:47:28 <mugwump> that works
14:47:30 * goron did run Debian for quite some time.
14:47:38 <goron> mugwump: It does?
14:48:03 <Cale> I've done that
14:48:04 <mugwump> sure.  just the other day I got a newer svk than was in unstable with apt-get -t experimental install svk
14:48:33 <Heffalump> it should work.
14:48:39 <goron> mugwump: So you just added experimental to your /etc/apt/sources.list and did that.
14:48:41 <mugwump> you can configure apt to only pull stuff from experimental/unstable if required, but use testing otherwise
14:48:43 <Heffalump> I'm not sure how much sympathy you'd get if something broke.
14:48:53 <Cale> provided that the package in experimental is working :)
14:49:10 <Heffalump> but in general package dependencies should be specified correctly to make that work, since eventually they will end up in stable with those dependencies.
14:49:11 <mugwump> You need to make an /etc/apt/apt.conf to have so many sources, though
14:49:42 * goron is quite happy to find out that at least one distro is said to be working :)
14:49:55 <goron> Thank you (and sorry of hijacking the channel).
14:50:00 <goron> :)
14:50:16 <goron> So you put ghc-6.4 from experimental?
14:50:22 <goron> er get
14:50:38 <mugwump> yeah I did that too
14:50:59 <goron> GHC is also a big problem for a lot of distro's.
14:51:13 <goron> Nobody cares about it.
14:51:44 <Heffalump> which distros?
14:51:50 <Heffalump> people care about it in Debian and gentoo, certainly.
14:51:52 <Cale> Why should it be a big problem? There are binaries available for packaging.
14:51:53 <Heffalump> and I think redhat.
14:52:02 <Heffalump> most distros need to package from source
14:52:09 <goron> Arch Linux for example.
14:52:19 <goron> I don't think Fedora supports it.
14:52:27 <goron> Although there might be packages.
14:52:47 <goron> A lot of distro's seem to use the model of distributed packaging.
14:52:56 <goron> Or are source-based.
14:53:00 <lightstep> there's a new ghc6.4 in unstable too (from the last week)
14:53:05 <Cale> Well, it's also not *that* hard to compile if you have a binary already :)
14:53:13 <Oejet> goron: GoboLinux supports it!
14:53:40 <goron> Cale: In Arch Linux openjade wasn't available.
14:53:48 <goron> Cale: Needed for ghc build.
14:54:08 <goron> Cale: Tracing all dependencies by hand is annoying.
14:54:08 <lightstep> where is Unicode?
14:55:01 <Cale> goron: hm? What do they normally do?
14:55:19 <mugwump> http://nopaste.snit.ch:8001/2548 # apt multi-dist configuration details
14:55:35 <Heffalump> oh, 6.4 moved into unstable?
14:55:38 <Heffalump> gah, recompiletastic.
14:55:48 <Heffalump> still, it needed to happen.
14:56:30 <lightstep> there's ghc6.4 in unstable for a long time (month or two), i think
14:56:56 <goron> Oejet: Do you run GogoLinux? It sure looks ok.
14:57:05 <lightstep> so does isSpace work correctly in utf8 terminals?
14:57:06 <goron> er gobo
14:57:30 <Igloo> Heff: Recompiling what?
14:57:44 <goron> lightstep: Char is now utf8, so why not?
14:58:03 <Heffalump> my package.
14:58:33 <Igloo> Heffalump: If you're uploading libraries then it would be sensible to wait until 6.4 has compiled on all arches (probably about 10 days away)
15:00:05 <Igloo> (and if it builds for nhc98 too then a new upstream of that will follow)
15:00:37 <goron> Cale: Their packagemanagement system rocks, though. Very simple.
15:00:38 <Heffalump> 10 days? ouch.
15:00:49 <goron> Oejet: was already gone. :(
15:01:16 <Igloo> Oh, actually, it should only be ~5
15:01:37 <Igloo> I plan to wait for m68k to finish building this one before uploading one to fix a build failure on ia64
15:07:49 <hellish> @pointless (\l -> return (Api.getContents (xmlParse l "stdTemplate.xhtml")))
15:07:50 <lambdabot> return . (Api .) . getContents . flip xmlParse "stdTemplate.xhtml"
15:08:33 <hellish> hmm.
15:23:10 <lispy> is there a way to make haskell flush it's output to disk?  or even at the OS level
15:23:55 <wilx> @type hFlush
15:24:01 <lambdabot> bzzt
15:24:04 <wilx> :)
15:24:12 <wilx> Just trying :)
15:24:26 <lispy> it was a good guess :)
15:24:35 <Cale> @type IO.hFlush
15:24:37 <lambdabot> IO.hFlush :: GHC.IOBase.Handle -> IO ()
15:24:43 <wilx> Oh.
15:24:45 <wilx> Duh.
15:28:47 <SyntaxNinja> what would one call the thingy that runs batch files in windows
15:28:55 <SyntaxNinja> one might call it the shell in unix
15:29:35 <lispy> command prompt is what i often call it
15:30:12 <SyntaxNinja> hm, but a prompt doesn't evaluate things.
15:31:19 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: would you prefer "annoying" or "half-baked"? :)
15:32:21 <SyntaxNinja> "our tool interfaces with the unix shell, as well as that annoying, half-baked thing that runs batch scripts in dos"
15:32:29 <SyntaxNinja> that would be pretty funny in a paper ;)
15:32:37 <lispy> yeah, it would ;)
15:33:42 <lispy> if it helps the binary image is called command.com in the win9x family and cmd.exe in the win32 familiy
15:36:38 <SyntaxNinja> thanks.
15:41:37 <lispy> oh, i guess what i really need to do is just set stdout to be line-buffered
15:41:44 <lispy> any idea how i would do that?
15:41:52 <lispy> i don't see how to get a handle for stdout
15:41:55 <wilx> Mmm, read the docs.
15:42:00 <wilx> For System.IO.
15:42:05 <wilx> It says it all.
15:42:54 <lispy> ah, i was looking at IOBase
15:43:00 <lispy> i'll check System.IO
15:45:14 <Cale> stdout is defined as a handle
15:45:35 <lispy> yeah,i just noticed that
15:45:37 <lispy> very nice
15:48:33 <lispy> ah, that helps a lot.  Thanks
15:48:58 <lispy> before i was waiting for the output buffer to overflow before i could get any data, and it was taking ages for that to happen
15:49:25 <Cale> lispy: you might also be interested in hSetBuffering then
15:49:36 <lispy> right, that's what i used
15:49:57 <lispy> hSetBuffering stdout LineBuffering
15:50:04 <lispy> did the trick perfectly
15:53:02 <shrimpx> lispy!
15:53:23 * shrimpx is suddenly reminded of #orlug
15:53:29 <lispy> heh
15:53:45 <lispy> shrimpx: not much happens in #orlug on weekends :)
15:53:54 <shrimpx> heh
15:58:23 <lispy> ah finally have some good data for pollard rho method
15:58:40 <lispy> and yay, it does appear to be O(m^(1/4))
16:01:05 <mugwump> the speed decreases for larger problem sets?
16:01:15 <mugwump> oh, duh. n/m
16:01:40 <hyp3rion> :)
16:01:44 <hyp3rion> :
16:03:51 <FrederikEaton> hey what's that debugger where it gives you the value of each expression and you say "yes that's right" or "no that's wrong"
16:04:02 <FrederikEaton> i could really use that
16:05:05 <lispy> FrederikEaton: i know of one like that for Excel, but it's my friend's PhD thesis, so i don't think it's published yet
16:05:36 <Cale> Buddha?
16:05:54 <FrederikEaton> Cale: thanks
16:05:58 <FrederikEaton> lispy: scary
16:06:00 <Cale> there's also Hat
16:06:17 <FrederikEaton> i think i've heard of Buddha. which is better?
16:06:28 <FrederikEaton> are they easy to use?
16:06:34 <Cale> I don't tend to use them
16:06:53 <Cale> I'll occasionally use Debug.Trace for really hard to find bugs
16:07:42 <lispy> FrederikEaton: we do a lot of end-user software engr stuff :)
16:08:16 <FrederikEaton> lispy: where are you?
16:08:24 <lispy> spreadsheets are often used by corporations to make big money decisions
16:08:29 <lispy> FrederikEaton: oregon state univ.
16:08:39 <FrederikEaton> oh. simon marlow?
16:09:11 <lispy> FrederikEaton: never heard of him :)
16:09:34 <lispy> but i've just joined the group this year...so maybe we work with him
16:10:07 <Cale> Isn't Simon Marlow working for Microsoft?
16:10:21 <lispy> Cale: that's what google says
16:10:24 <FrederikEaton> oh i'm thinking of mark p. jones
16:10:27 <lispy> http://research.microsoft.com/~simonmar/
16:10:46 <FrederikEaton> i knew it was some variation of simon p. jones :)
16:11:01 <lispy> FrederikEaton: ah, that's OGI, they are north of us by a bit
16:11:06 <FrederikEaton> oh ok
16:11:09 <lispy> good school from what i hear
16:11:14 <shrimpx> they're psu now =)
16:11:37 <lispy> really?
16:11:41 <shrimpx> ya
16:11:47 <lispy> weird
16:12:10 <shrimpx> i think on paper, MPJ is still at OGI due to some weird issues -- but programatica is at PSU now
16:12:40 <shrimpx> OGI fell apart and we took 12 profs
16:12:43 <shrimpx> and their students
16:12:50 <shrimpx> OGI/CS that is
16:12:55 <lispy> that's good for PSU
16:13:02 <shrimpx> i guess
16:13:15 <shrimpx> they might even get rated in the next few years =)
16:13:23 <lispy> i never went there, but i've heard they're reputation is not so hot
16:13:30 <shrimpx> heh yep
16:13:49 <Heffalump> did they just make a strategic decision to hire all the talent that had conveniently appeared on the market, then?
16:13:55 <FrederikEaton> are they the ones that spam me with diploma offers?
16:14:06 <shrimpx> Heffalump: yea pretty much
16:14:19 <lispy> FrederikEaton: heh
16:14:37 <shrimpx> they're hoping to get into the top 50 really soon and top 15 in the not so long term
16:14:58 <shrimpx> OGI was about top 15 when it didn't suck
16:16:00 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: I didn't realize you were in oregon. how far is that from portland?
16:16:08 <lispy> shrimpx: OSU is striving for the top 15 as well, and i've heard they started slipping as soon as they started to really push for it :)
16:16:27 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: i think it's what 90 min by freeway
16:17:01 <SyntaxNinja> ahh
16:17:04 <SyntaxNinja> <-- portland
16:17:05 <shrimpx> lispy: haha
16:17:22 <shrimpx> <-- portland too
16:17:26 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: ah, cool
16:17:40 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: you'll have to stop by #orlug sometime
16:17:52 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: I should. I always run into free software hackers on the train
16:17:53 <FrederikEaton> i bought the usnw rankings. it's weird how things change. for CS, UCSD is tied for 20th with harvard
16:17:55 <shrimpx> SyntaxNinja: you're a galois guy, right?
16:17:58 <SyntaxNinja> shrimpx: are ou invovled in programatica?
16:17:59 <SyntaxNinja> shrimpx: yeah
16:18:12 <shrimpx> SyntaxNinja: i sit in on meetings sometimes when they're at psu
16:18:25 <FrederikEaton> let's see OGI is #60 now
16:18:45 <FrederikEaton> OSU is #67
16:18:50 <shrimpx> where's UW? :)
16:19:01 <lispy> FrederikEaton: what is the url?
16:19:18 <FrederikEaton> lispy: you have to pay $15
16:19:21 <lispy> oh
16:19:26 <FrederikEaton> http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/phdsci/premium/com.php
16:19:42 <FrederikEaton> UW is #7
16:19:48 <FrederikEaton> i'm considering UCSC #55
16:20:06 <shrimpx> hawt
16:20:11 <FrederikEaton> or cornell #6 MEng
16:20:14 <lispy> wow, UW is higher than i realized
16:20:22 <shrimpx> ya they're hardcore
16:21:30 <shrimpx> a lot of people are like "UW? are they any good?"
16:21:51 <FrederikEaton> 1 is CMU, MIT, Stanford, UCB; then 5. U Illinois Urbana-Champaign; then 6. Cornell, 7. UT Austin, UW, 9. Princeton, 10. CIT, UWisc Madison
16:22:42 <FrederikEaton> there are free world rankings here: http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/rank/2004/top500list.htm
16:26:05 <shrimpx> heh cmu is 62nd on that list
16:28:24 <Cale> I think the methodology used is a little less than comprehensive :)
16:32:41 <shrimpx> yea =)
16:35:14 <dons> anyone want to write a hoogle plugin for lambdabot?
16:35:46 <lispy> and violate their usage agreement? :)
16:35:53 <dons> really?
16:36:04 <lispy> depends on how you use it i guess
16:36:14 <FrederikEaton> Cale: but it's nice because it's based on actual research results, not money
16:36:31 <FrederikEaton> Cale: the chinese rankings, that is
16:37:03 <dons> well, we can surely just use MiniHTTP to talk to it directly..
16:37:06 <lispy> dons: http://www.google.com/terms_of_service.html
16:37:07 <dons> we don't need our own copy
16:37:13 <dons> no, hoogle..
16:37:28 <dons> http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/hoogle/
16:37:41 <dons> we already have @google ;)
16:37:53 <dons> @google lambdabot
16:37:53 <lispy> oh, i thought hoogle was a clever name for a google feature for lambdabot :)
16:37:54 <lambdabot> http://cvs.sf.net/viewcvs.py/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot/
16:38:06 <dons> @google lambdabot site:cse.unsw.edu.au
16:38:08 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html
16:40:06 <FrederikEaton> so can i talk to lambdabot privately?
16:40:15 <dons> yep.
16:40:52 <FrederikEaton> i guess that makes it more useful
16:41:05 <FrederikEaton> and me less lonely
16:41:09 <FrederikEaton> :)
16:41:15 <dons> hehe
16:47:42 <sylvan> I'm having trouble doing OpenGL with ghc-6.4 (linux).. OpenGL is listed under packages (ghc-pkg -l) but when compiling the Teapot.hs example I get: Chasing modules from: Teapots.hs
16:47:42 <sylvan> Skipping  Main             ( Teapots.hs, Teapots.o )
16:47:42 <sylvan> Linking ...
16:47:42 <sylvan> /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4/libHSGLUT.a(Window__227.o)(.text+0x1fd): undefined reference to `glutGetModifiers'
16:47:42 <sylvan> /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4/libHSGLUT.a(Window__227.o)(.text+0x375): undefined reference to `glutGetModifiers'
16:47:45 <sylvan> Any ideas?
16:48:03 <sylvan> (there's more errors like that
16:48:04 <sylvan> )
16:50:17 <dons> does  the symbol `glutGetModifiers' live in /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4/libHSGLUT.a?
16:50:25 <dons> checck with nm /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4/libHSGLUT.a | less
16:50:55 <SyntaxNinja> sylvan: and you use the -package glut flag or whatever?
16:51:19 <SyntaxNinja> or -package OpenGL
16:52:56 <sylvan> yep
16:53:37 <SyntaxNinja> is there a glut package too?
16:53:50 <SyntaxNinja> or is the glut library in the OpenGL package?
16:54:06 <sylvan> I've tried the glut package as well
16:54:10 <sylvan> and both
16:54:20 <sylvan> it seems to find the package, but not the libraries.. or something...
16:54:28 <SyntaxNinja> and you get the same errors? looks like you need both flags, fwiw
16:54:50 <SyntaxNinja> do yuo get undefined reference to those symbols w/ the glut flag? also, do what dons said :)
16:56:06 <sylvan> sylvan@sylvan:~/haskell/opengl$ nm /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4/libHSGLUT.a | grep "glutGetModifiers"
16:56:06 <sylvan>          U glutGetModifiers
16:56:06 <sylvan> sylvan@sylvan:~/haskell/opengl$
16:56:21 <sylvan> so I guess it does live there... I think
16:57:15 <dons> U means undefined
16:57:18 <sylvan> ah
16:58:08 <sylvan> well i don't know.. i just installed ghc with apt-get and all the glut stuff I could find.. don't know how to fix this.. i only started using linux about 2 days ago, didn't need to do anything on windows it just worked..
16:58:56 <dons> glutGetModifiers is a C function. I wonder where it lives
16:59:23 <sylvan> probably in some glut-lib.. and I might need to tell GHC where to find those libs...
16:59:35 <sylvan> but IIRC that should be done "automatically" when the package is registered
16:59:55 <sylvan> the OpenGL-2.0 and GLUT-2.0 packages I mean
17:00:21 <dons> it should  be done automatically. the C lib dependencies are listed in the library's pacckage.conf file.
17:00:38 <sylvan> where can I find that after it's been registered already?
17:00:42 <SyntaxNinja> sylvan: did you install libopengl-dev?
17:00:51 <SyntaxNinja> ghc-pkg -l will show you the package file that mentions the libraries you need
17:01:24 <SyntaxNinja> or something like that -dev package
17:01:52 <SyntaxNinja> and libglade0-dev
17:01:57 <SyntaxNinja> don't know ift ehre's an opengl-dev package
17:01:58 <sylvan> hmm... can't find libopengl-dev I did install all the glut stuff and it should find those dependencies automatically right?
17:02:47 <SyntaxNinja> idono, does glut depend on opengl?
17:02:57 <SyntaxNinja> you have to instal the -dev packages if you want ot build such software, not just use it
17:03:04 <sylvan> yeah it should
17:03:08 <sylvan> yeah I installed the glut-dev stuff
17:03:16 <SyntaxNinja> oh, but yeah, if you installed hopengl with apt, then everything should have gotten installed hmm
17:03:52 <sylvan> hopengl I didn't install, I just installed ghc and it was listed in the packages..
17:04:15 <sylvan> oh I did install hopengl it seems, but it still doesn't work
17:05:42 <SyntaxNinja> hm. strange.
17:06:08 <sylvan> when I do "ghc-pkg describe" it says that the libs are at usr/local/lib/ghc-6.4
17:06:17 <sylvan> It seems like it's not finding the c libs
17:06:41 <sylvan> and also: "extra-libraries: HSGLUT_cbits"
17:06:46 <sylvan> hmm.. weird?
17:06:58 <thou> sylvan: looks like it's the haskell side of things that's not being found
17:07:24 <sylvan> oh, but it did find the HOpenGL libs but it didn't find a reference from that lib, right?
17:07:27 <thou> err, nevermind me
17:07:29 <thou> yeah
17:07:32 <sylvan> okay
17:07:56 <SyntaxNinja> so sylvan, you promise that if you compile with the -package OpenGL and -package GLUT flags that it still complains about glut-related symbols?
17:08:39 <sylvan> yep
17:08:45 <thou> sylvan: if you do  nm /usr/X11R6/lib/libglut.a| grep glutGetModifiers  what do you get?
17:08:53 <thou> do you get a line starting with T?
17:08:56 <SyntaxNinja> sylvan: btw, this is w/ the new ghc 6.4 package?
17:09:08 <SyntaxNinja> thou: scroll up :)
17:09:11 <sylvan> sylvan@sylvan:~/haskell/opengl$ ghc --make Teapots.hs -package OpenGL-2.0 -package GLUT-2.0
17:09:11 <sylvan> Chasing modules from: Teapots.hs

17:09:18 <sylvan> yeah 6.4
17:09:46 <thou> SyntaxNinja: i just saw one where sylvan grepped in libHSGLUT.a
17:09:54 <thou> but the symbol is defined in libglut.a
17:09:59 <SyntaxNinja> oh right
17:10:37 <sylvan> sylvan@sylvan:~/haskell/opengl$ nm /usr/lib/libglut.a | grep "glutGetModifiers"
17:10:37 <sylvan>          U glutGetModifiers
17:10:37 <sylvan> 00000647 T glutGetModifiers
17:10:46 <thou> isn't there a way to get GHC to show the exact line it's using?  does -v show the link line?
17:11:12 <thou> sylvan: ok, so it's there, looks like maybe the GLUT package isn't telling ghc to link against libglut, or the libraries are in the wrong order or something?
17:11:30 <dons> adding  -lglut might help then.
17:11:42 <thou> yeah, shouldn't need it, but it might help get past this point for now
17:11:46 <SyntaxNinja> my ghc-pkg lists -lglut as a param when using the -package GLUT
17:11:51 <sylvan> haha, -lglut fixed it, thanks!
17:11:53 <dons> you can get the exact command line with -v99
17:11:59 <dons> -v9
17:12:06 <dons> damn wireless latency
17:12:56 <dons> sylvan, when using -package GLUT is -lglut passed as a parameter? (check with -v9)
17:13:09 <thou> sylvan: so, something wrong w/ the debian package of the hs GLUT lib, looks like
17:13:13 <sylvan> yeah, looks like the glut package.conf doesn't contain "-lglut"
17:13:27 <dons> should contain "glut" in extra-libraries, I think.
17:13:30 <sylvan> (in ld-options)
17:13:54 <SyntaxNinja> thou: no, I think the package.conf is wrong somehow
17:13:54 <thou> sylvan: i filed a bug report to make GLUT build on freebsd, and it was recently committed; maybe it also has a bearing debian
17:13:56 <sylvan> but the OpenGL-2.0 contains -lglu -lgl so that's right
17:14:15 <sylvan> I'll just fix the package conf and reregister it, I think
17:14:45 <SyntaxNinja> no need to reregister
17:14:55 <SyntaxNinja> well, actually I won't swear to that :)
17:14:58 <dons> hmm. I have ldOptions = ["-lglut",...] in the GLUT package.conf in a ghc that I built by hand on debian.
17:15:23 * thou spreads his hands, palms up
17:15:49 <sylvan> hmm... weird.. well i just took a precompiled one since GHC has a habit of taking a metric ton of time to compile
17:15:51 <dons> why isn't "glut' in extraLibraries. this seems a bit odd that they explicitly add it to ldOptions instead.
17:16:05 <SyntaxNinja> yeah
17:16:58 <dons> readline is well behaved at least: extraLibraries = ["readline","ncurses"]
17:17:01 <thou> btw, is HSQL installable w/ ghc6.4?  I ran into problems (tried both latest release & CVS) when doing 'gmake install' - bad packaging info
17:17:53 <SyntaxNinja> thou: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/packages/
17:17:56 <thou> sylvan: what takes a metric ton of time is hsgtk2
17:17:57 <SyntaxNinja> the one there is cabal-ized
17:18:11 <sylvan> =)
17:18:18 <thou> SyntaxNinja: awesome
17:18:28 <sylvan> anyway, thanks for the help.. now for some sleep
17:18:42 <dons> @seen basti_
17:18:43 <lambdabot> I saw basti_ leaving #haskell 3 minutes and 42 seconds ago.
17:18:57 <dons> 3  minutes ago. doh!
17:19:23 <thou> damn, no screenshot of his teapots?!
17:19:32 * thou feels gypped
17:19:45 <Pseudonym> http://andrew.bromage.org/lviro/
17:19:50 <Pseudonym> I have teapots, if that helps...
17:21:48 <thou> :-)
17:22:11 <thou> it's one of the ones that crashes for me
17:22:26 <juhp> SyntaxNinja: what platform are those .tgz packages for? :)
17:23:27 <SyntaxNinja> juhp: well, anything that works with cabal, I hope, but they were used for debian
17:23:45 <juhp> so linux :)
17:24:10 <juhp> ah they're src pkgs? :)
17:24:13 <thou> juhp: no, they're cabalized source pkgs
17:24:25 <juhp> gotcha
17:24:45 <thou> at least the hsql-1.2 one is configuring & building good OK on freebsd :-)
17:24:52 <juhp> nice
17:30:36 <dcoutts> if we're talking about cabal... can someone agree with me that this is a cabal bug: hxt-5.01 get's installed as hxt-5.1
17:30:51 <dcoutts> it gets installed to /usr/lib/hxt-5.1/
17:31:16 <dcoutts> that's not going to be good when hxt-5.1 comes out! :-)
17:33:01 <dcoutts> and something else, what is it whith cabalised tarballs having screwy names? hxt's package name is "hxt" but the tarball is "HXT-5.01" and it unpacks to that too
17:33:33 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: the version should be listed as 5.0.1
17:33:37 <dcoutts> there is similar oddness for "NewBinary" and "Crypto" packages
17:34:00 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: the tarball names have nothing to do w/ cabal, people generate them on their own.
17:34:20 <dcoutts> I thought that ./setup dist generated tarballs for you
17:34:36 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, it does, based ont he names, but it hardly works and shouldn't be used :)
17:34:44 <SyntaxNinja> that is, based on the package name
17:34:52 <dcoutts> if it works and people use it we could have some kind of order! :-)
17:35:04 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, it needs to be fixed
17:35:34 <dcoutts> We cannot automatically generate ebuilds or rpm spec files or whatever if there is this kind of randomness to the cabal packages
17:35:55 <SyntaxNinja> you need to know the name of the tarballs? just rename them.
17:36:15 <SyntaxNinja> for now, the tarball names are outside the scope of cabal, and its up to the package authors.
17:36:16 <dcoutts> we need to know the name of the tarballs to be able to download them
17:36:19 <SyntaxNinja> complain to the specific package authors
17:36:37 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: download them from where?
17:37:32 <dcoutts> to download them from where ever they are available, eg ebuilds contain the source uri of the package which is where the thing gets grabed from so it ca be mirrored
17:37:59 <SyntaxNinja> you can get the package location from the .cabal file if the author has provided it
17:38:06 <dcoutts> if the tools make it easy to "do the right thing" then everyone will do the right thing :-)
17:38:12 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts like I said.
17:38:48 <dcoutts> yes, I know. sorry, I'm just grumbling after making ebuilds for various cabal packages
17:39:17 <dcoutts> that said, I'm not really grumbling much since that was vastly easier than it used to be! :-)
17:39:34 <SyntaxNinja> that's good
17:39:36 <SyntaxNinja> what are ebuilds?
17:40:02 <dcoutts> ebuilds are Gentoo Linux's package management 'things'
17:40:28 <dcoutts> they correspond to rpm .spec files or debians various metadata files
17:40:53 * SyntaxNinja nods
17:41:09 <dcoutts> eg: here's a really simple one for a non-cabalised package: http://haskell.org/~gentoo/gentoo-haskell/portage/dev-haskell/cpphs/cpphs-0.9.ebuild
17:41:22 <SyntaxNinja> when people upload packages to the hackage server, it changes the tarball name to conform to the standard
17:41:36 <dcoutts> that sounds good
17:42:15 <SyntaxNinja> pretty soon, you'll be able to write an xml-rpc client which will be able to query hackage if there's a newer version of a package, and provide you a URL to download it from
17:42:24 * dons has to stop him self typing 'darcs' when using cvs.
17:43:21 <Igloo> There's another solution to that problem  :-)
17:43:55 <SyntaxNinja> heh
17:44:01 <thou> SyntaxNinja: hmm, in hsql.cabal I see -Isrc/HSQL in CC-Options; but there's no such directory (should it be -Isrc/Database/HSQL?)
17:44:11 <dons> :) unfortunately some projects still haven't switched.
17:44:24 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja: what we're aiming for is a tool that will convert a cabal package to a native ebuild so Haskell packages can be managed by the native package manager
17:44:40 <dons> hm!!
17:45:03 <dons> how general would this approach be, do you think duncan?
17:45:09 <dcoutts> at the moment we haven't got it going fully automatically but that's the aim
17:45:13 <Igloo> dcoutts: The difficulty comes when you get an updated package and need to merge the old (altered) e-build with what you would generate for the new one
17:45:23 <wagle> SyntaxNinja: you guys got ghc64 to build in tiger yet?
17:45:38 <dons> i.e. hm. e-builds are a lot like BSD ports, aren't they?
17:45:49 <dcoutts> dons: yes they are
17:46:05 <dons> just generating a stub would be useful.
17:46:22 <thou> SyntaxNinja: SyntaxNinja looks like it's only used when --enable-odbc is passed
17:46:24 <dcoutts> Igloo: no, we just generate a new ebuild, no merging at all. seperate versions are seperate ebuilds
17:46:47 <Igloo> dcoutts: But then you have to repeat whatever changes you had to make...
17:46:54 <thou> SyntaxNinja: error in configure.ac
17:47:01 <dons> generated stubs (or full makefiles) would definitely increase the speed at which I could get things ported to OpenBSD.
17:47:10 <dcoutts> Igloo, which is why we're aiming for 0 manual changes! :-)
17:47:44 <dcoutts> true, if a package has problems we'd need to copy over the hacks from the old version
17:48:28 <lispy> hack'n to the oldies
17:49:54 <Igloo> Even things like wanting to add "Suggests: vim" or whatever (or your equivalent)
17:50:23 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, so "5.01" is not a valid version number for a package?
17:50:54 <dcoutts> Igloo, we don't have any equivalent to Suggests: foo
17:52:38 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, if that's true, can we make cabal complain to the package author that the version number is not valid rather than converting it to "5.1"?
17:52:39 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: it's valid, but is the same as 5.1
17:54:02 <dcoutts> hmmm, I've got a feeling that it might bite the hxt authors some time
17:54:23 <SyntaxNinja> thou: don't know much about that hsql package, ask Lemmih
17:55:22 <SyntaxNinja> what's hxt? someone should kick them and let them know
17:55:33 <dcoutts> http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/
17:55:43 <SyntaxNinja> cabal version numbers are limited to a very simple syntax that everyone must conform to
17:56:12 <thou> SyntaxNinja: i fixed it by changing configure.ac to add the right -I flag
17:56:34 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, that's good, but I think it could be stricter :-) so the hxt people couldn't get away with doing odd things
17:57:11 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: so you think I should add a warning if any of the decimal places begin in zeros that would be ignored?
17:57:42 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, yes, that'd be great (it could even be an error IMHO)
17:58:28 <dcoutts> cabal: "don't do that, call it '5.1 or '5.0.1' silly!"
17:59:40 <wagle> SyntaxNinja: you guys got ghc64 to build in tiger yet?
18:00:22 <wagle> someone was having the same trouble here, earlier
18:00:22 <Pseudonym> I find the practice of postpending "-oogle" to indicate a search tool even more irritating than postpending "-gate" to indicate a scandal.
18:00:36 <wagle> ooglegate!
18:00:44 <Pseudonym> gateoogle!
18:00:47 <SyntaxNinja> eh, it seems like a bit of a pain for a relatively rare problem
18:01:12 <SyntaxNinja> and I can't put it in the parser. maybe I could see if parse . show == the original text; that might be a useful waring
18:01:25 <SyntaxNinja> wagle: not sure why you're asking me that
18:01:25 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, if cabal behaves more like a package enforcement bot, it'll make life easier for tools like hackage and other similar (semi-)automatic tools
18:01:38 <Igloo> Can't you put it in the lexer?
18:01:39 <Pseudonym> Although I did see a rather clever crossword clue a few weeks ago.  Clue: "Engender seemly scandal"  Answer: "propagate"
18:01:48 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: it just uses readp
18:01:55 <wagle> keeping track of which scandal is which?  use gatoogle!
18:02:14 <Pseudonym> I wonder if there are any more of these postfixes.
18:03:07 <SyntaxNinja> so I wonder if there's ever a time when "(show (parse x)) /= x" is not an error for version numbers
18:03:27 <wagle> well, a number of people have macs at galois, including dylan, who i know was having trouble a week ago
18:04:27 <SyntaxNinja> wagle: sorry, don't know anything about tiger.
18:04:34 <SyntaxNinja> <-- Debian only
18:05:06 <wagle> i just thought you might have heard people grumbling then cheering when they got it to build
18:05:08 <Igloo> wagle: If gcc 4 is the problem source then there are some fixes in CVS
18:05:23 <SyntaxNinja> wagle: nope, haven't heard anything
18:05:35 <wagle> oh well
18:05:48 <wagle> i dont have tiger yet, for a while
18:05:49 <SyntaxNinja> wagle: we're mostly using 6.2
18:06:25 <wagle> will cost me about $600, i think
18:06:54 <wagle> (gotta upgrade the rest of the proprietary software..  8/
18:06:57 <wagle> )
18:06:59 <SyntaxNinja> why bother?
18:07:28 <wagle> because its already starting to break under 10.3
18:07:42 <wagle> and the glass is half empty..
18:07:47 <SyntaxNinja> $600 is a lot of money for software
18:09:05 <wagle> yup
18:11:48 <wagle> not horrible if you have a real job and pay only every year or two
18:12:20 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja: do you mind if I ask about another cabal difficulty/issue we Gentoo people are having, or I can write it up and send it to libraries@haskell.org if you'd rather not talk about it now :-)
18:12:55 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: no problem
18:13:07 <dcoutts> ok... it's to do with ./setup register
18:13:10 <shrimpx> wagle: are you still at ogi?
18:13:41 <wagle> shrimpx: sort of
18:13:48 <dcoutts> so ./setup register provides the --gen-script option which we're using but it doesn't quite do what we want
18:14:11 <dcoutts> the install procedure for an ebuild goes like this:
18:14:38 <dcoutts> install into temp dir then merge into filesystem
18:14:57 <dcoutts> now everything that is in the temp dir gets recorded as belonging to the package
18:15:24 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: right
18:15:25 <dcoutts> any files created after the merge into the filesystem are not managed by the package manager and that's a bad thing
18:15:54 <dcoutts> so the problem is with the GHCi .o files, they are created by the register.sh script
18:16:21 <dcoutts> and that cannot be run before the merge or after so at the moment we hack the script
18:16:51 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: hm. that's a bit annoying. unfortunitely, that's how ghc-pkg works
18:16:57 <dcoutts> we remove the --auto-ghci-libs option and do that bit ourselves which obviously is not ideal
18:17:28 <SyntaxNinja> hwo do you do that without ghc-pkg anyway?
18:17:36 <dcoutts> like so:
18:17:49 <dcoutts> # make a ghci foo.o file from a libfoo.a file
18:17:50 <dcoutts> ghc-makeghcilib() {
18:17:50 <dcoutts>     local outfile
18:17:50 <dcoutts>     outfile="$(dirname $1)/$(basename $1 | sed 's:^lib\?\(.*\)\.a$:\1.o:')"
18:17:50 <dcoutts>     ld --relocatable --discard-all --output="${outfile}" --whole-archive $1
18:17:50 <dcoutts> }
18:18:00 <dcoutts> that's in bash syntax
18:18:36 <dcoutts> if you look inside ghc-pkg that's exaclty what it's doing too
18:18:49 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: well, presumably there's some haskell code in ghc-pkg to do this, which we could rip out and put into the build phase of cabal
18:18:52 <dons> isn't there a simpler way in $fptools/mk. hmm. let me see.
18:18:56 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: or is ghc-pkg written in sh?
18:19:00 <SyntaxNinja> bash I mean
18:19:06 <dcoutts> ghc-pkg is in Haskell
18:19:36 <dcoutts> yes, doing the .o generation during build would be good for us
18:20:02 <dons> $(GHCI_LIBRARY) : $(LIBOBJS)
18:20:03 <dons>         $(LD_X) -r -o $@ $(STUBOBJS) $(LIBOBJS)
18:20:14 <dons> oh, but that needs the .o files.
18:20:20 <dcoutts> however... juhp and the debain packaging folk might complain because...
18:21:05 <dcoutts> for .rpms and .debs it's nice to not have to include the GHCi .o files in the package since the just take up more space
18:21:37 <dcoutts> I know juhp likes to generate the GHCi .o files at install time rather than build time
18:21:53 <Heffalump> by unpacking the .a ?
18:22:02 <dcoutts> Heffalump, exactly
18:22:13 <dons> yep. I do it at install time on OpenBSD too.
18:22:17 <SyntaxNinja> I don't think the debian folks would complain
18:22:26 <SyntaxNinja> maybe it could be a configure option
18:22:33 <SyntaxNinja> debian likes to have files managed by packages too
18:22:42 <Heffalump> so does Redhat.
18:22:52 <SyntaxNinja> I wonder if ghc-pkg removes the ghci libs upon unregister
18:22:52 <dcoutts> yes, just what I was going to say, an option a build or configure time
18:22:56 <Heffalump> I certainly couldn't care less about the size of the packages, within reason.
18:23:05 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: I filed a bug report for both of your requests
18:23:17 <dcoutts> eg ./setup build --no-ghci-libs
18:23:34 <dcoutts> which means, don't do it for me, i'll do it myself
18:24:26 <SyntaxNinja> and register should never do it, presumably
18:24:41 <SyntaxNinja> I wonder if ghc-pkg will remove during unregister them if I generate them during build, though.
18:24:44 <SyntaxNinja> that would be annoying
18:25:17 <dcoutts> the other thing I was thinking of, perhaps there could be a "./setup register"  option that just gives us the .cabal file to register rather than producing a script that embeds the .cabal file and does the registering all in one go, it'd give the packaging system more control over ghc-pkg options
18:25:31 <dcoutts> and register should never do it, presumably: yes exaclty
18:25:55 <dcoutts> I don't think ghc-pkg removes anything upon unregister
18:26:19 <dcoutts> as far as I know it leaves all .a .hi .o files alone, it just deals with the package config database
18:27:46 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja: btw, where is the cabal bug db? the cabal home page says to send emails to libraries@haskell.org
18:28:30 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja: and thank's for fileing my rather rambling bug reports :-)
18:29:15 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: I use the debian bug tracking system for cabal bugs: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=haskell-cabal
18:29:32 <dcoutts> thanks
18:29:59 <SyntaxNinja> generating the file and script separately would definitely be easier
18:30:12 <SyntaxNinja> and less error prone, there was a bug for ghc 6.4 in cabal 1.0
18:30:30 * Heffalump goes to bed
18:30:40 <SyntaxNinja> I think I'm going to make a cabal release tomorrow or so
18:30:46 <SyntaxNinja> with many bug fixes
18:31:46 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja: yes one of the sed hacks we perform on the register.sh is for that ghc-6.4/cabal-1.0 bug
18:33:07 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah, it's fixed now, but not released
18:33:34 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, great.
18:34:21 <dcoutts> I should go to bed too. Thank's v. much for all the help SyntaxNinja. Sorry I started off by grumbling! :-)
18:35:27 <wagle> its still a beautiful sunny day!
18:36:21 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: no problem. keep up the bug reports :) patches are welcome too
19:59:16 <blackdog> ... anyone here?
19:59:40 <dons> yeah!
19:59:46 <dons> @ghc
19:59:47 <lambdabot>  Command stack underflow at command
19:59:55 <dons> oooh goody
19:59:58 <dons> @ghc
19:59:59 <lambdabot>  Type found where type variable expected
20:00:00 <blackdog> you're a masochist
20:00:07 <dons> uh oh.
20:00:20 <Gahhh> @ghc
20:00:20 <lambdabot>  The instance types do not agree with the functional dependencies of
20:00:20 <lambdabot> the class
20:00:31 <blackdog> treating ghc as a cornucopia of error messages is so perverted
20:00:34 <dons> can't they just agree to disagreeE?
20:00:50 * blackdog grins despite himself
20:01:08 <Gahhh> I have a few microsoft c++ compiler error messages pinned to my cubicle wall at work.
20:01:18 <dons> it's a new CONCEPT in type checking!
20:01:36 * dons zippies up
20:01:48 <dons> @yow
20:01:49 <lambdabot> I'm sitting on my SPEED QUEEN ... To me, it's ENJOYABLE ... I'm
20:01:49 <lambdabot> WARM
20:01:49 <lambdabot> ... I'm VIBRATORY ...
20:01:59 <dons> yikes!
20:02:20 <dons> hmm. looks like @vixen has been talking to @yow
20:04:11 <dons> XTC special on 2ser
20:07:46 <blackdog> dons: now?
20:07:58 <dons> almost finished I think. last hour.
20:08:22 <dons> comparing XTC to current post-punk bands who mightn't realise who they sound like
20:08:38 <dons> oh, maybe another hour to go
20:09:09 <blackdog> heh. heard "Dogs Die in Hot Cars"?
20:09:21 <blackdog> they claim they hadn't heard XTC until they'd released the album
20:09:33 <dons> I think I've heard them on rage.
20:09:51 <blackdog> the funny thing is that XTC abandoned the post-punk thing pretty early - they went all pastoral and melodic.
20:10:15 <dons> yeah.
20:10:32 <dons> but the first album's pretty wild from what i've heard of it.
20:10:42 <blackdog> white music?
20:10:53 <dons> yeah
20:13:22 <dons> heard the new beck-i'm-going-back-to-odelay album?
20:14:06 <blackdog> not yet
20:14:16 <dons> pretty fun, I reckon.
20:15:19 <blackdog> ok, shall check it out. i'm mostly listening to the new aesop rock, superwolf and edan at the moment. (Danger, Fast Cars, Fire and Knives is both an awesome song and a killer title)
20:16:40 <blackdog> drums and wires is still my favourite fast and jangly xtc album :)
20:30:21 <blackdog> man, if you guys keep staying quiet, i'm going to have to go talk monad combinators in #hiphop
20:30:34 <dons> :P
20:31:15 <Pseudonym> Busy cabalising number theory libraries.
20:31:22 <Pseudonym> Sorry, not so talkative.
20:32:07 <blackdog> Pseudonym: is there an easy way to go from a ghc-pkg description to a cabal one? Or is it a different kind of information?
20:32:13 <Pseudonym> No idea.
20:32:22 <Pseudonym> You tell me, then I might not be so busy. :_)
20:33:51 <dons> blackdog, do you mean old style ghc package.conf and new style?
20:34:05 <dons> because those are fairly easy to translate
20:34:06 <blackdog> um, might do.
20:34:22 <blackdog> oh, ok. i think i was trying to do WASH a while back, failed, and went back to 6.2
20:35:32 <dons> maybe have a look at yi.conf.in.cpp or the ones in hs-plugins. they build on both ghcs
20:35:46 <Pseudonym> Need lunch.  BBL
20:35:55 <blackdog> dons: cheers, shall do.
20:44:36 <seba> it is posible to read the input from a file in haskell?
20:44:50 <seba> sorry... in hugs
20:44:57 <dons> of course
20:45:05 <dons> @type getContents
20:45:10 <lambdabot> getContents :: IO String
20:45:16 <araujo> seba, uruguay?
20:45:32 <seba> araujo: si, si uruguay
20:45:38 <araujo> nice :-)
20:45:52 * araujo is from venezuela
20:46:02 <Pseudonym> Back.  Short lunch.
20:46:04 <araujo> how is haskell doing over there?
20:47:02 <seba> i need to read de standard input from a file
20:47:44 <dons> @type readFile
20:47:46 <lambdabot> readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
20:47:54 <seba> in other words... I need to redirect the standard input to a file
20:48:15 <dons> @type writeFile
20:48:17 <lambdabot> writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO ()
20:48:20 <araujo> hah
20:48:40 <FrederikEaton> how do i do asserts when not in the IO monad?
20:48:43 <araujo> it's not the same...
20:48:53 <dons> @type getContents >>= writeFile "f"
20:48:54 <lambdabot> getContents >>= writeFile "f" :: IO ()
20:50:54 <dons> you can just assert as normal,can't you?
20:51:27 <dons> @type Control.Exception.assert (1 == 2) $ do return ()
20:51:29 <lambdabot> Control.Exception.assert (1 == 2) $ do return () :: forall (m :: *
20:51:29 <lambdabot>                       -> *).
20:51:29 <lambdabot>                   (Monad m) =>
20:51:29 <lambdabot>                   m ()
20:52:19 <dons> @type Control.Exception.assert (1 == 2) $ 1 + 2
20:52:20 <lambdabot> Control.Exception.assert (1 == 2) $ 1 + 2 :: forall a. (Num a) =>
20:52:20 <lambdabot> a
20:53:37 <FrederikEaton> i don't understand what's happening there
20:53:50 <dons> how have you previously been doiing asserts?
20:54:19 <FrederikEaton> i haven't
20:54:59 <FrederikEaton> the docs say type Assertion = IO ()
20:55:32 <dons> @type Control.Exception.assert
20:55:33 <lambdabot> Control.Exception.assert :: forall a. Bool -> a -> a
20:55:58 <FrederikEaton> oops i was looking at the HUnit docs
20:56:12 <dons> :}
20:56:24 <FrederikEaton> now i will use them all the time
20:56:51 <FrederikEaton> do people use HUnit by the way?
20:57:24 <blackdog> no, haskell has magical static typing pixie dust that makes sure all your programs work as soon as they compile.
20:57:35 * blackdog waits for shapr to hunt me down and kill me slowly.
20:57:38 <FrederikEaton> ah
20:57:52 <blackdog> i'm kidding, i'm kidding. HUnit is nice. QuickCheck is also cool.
20:58:22 <dons> the secret is just to encode all your hunit tests into the type system to begin with!
20:58:30 <dons> of course.
21:18:04 <Pseudonym> OK, question.  Age-old question, in fact.
21:18:14 <FrederikEaton> drum roll
21:18:22 <Pseudonym> Are negative numbers prime?
21:18:26 <Pseudonym> I _think_ so.
21:18:31 <Pseudonym> But what would be the most useful semantics?
21:19:07 <juhp> hmm, not having luck with gtk2hs on x86_64...
21:19:18 <FrederikEaton> Pseudonym: usually in ring theory we talk about prime ideals
21:19:23 <Pseudonym> Yes.
21:19:27 <Pseudonym> Similarly in group theory.
21:19:46 <FrederikEaton> then you choose the smallest positive representative and say that is "prime"
21:20:26 <FrederikEaton> i guess you could say that anything generating a prime ideal is a prime number, which would include negative numbers as well
21:20:40 <FrederikEaton> but then you're including two representatives of each ideal
21:20:47 <FrederikEaton> group theory?
21:21:00 <Pseudonym> Groups have ideals just like rings.
21:21:31 <Pseudonym> But with finite groups, for example, the "primeness" is related to group order, and you can't have a negative-order group.
21:21:45 * Pseudonym knows more group theory than ring theory
21:22:48 <Pseudonym> MathWorld says a prime number is a positive integer p > 1 such that [etc etc].
21:22:48 <FrederikEaton> anyway, wikipedia says that in ring theory generally additive inverses are included. and i think their definition includes 1 as well in the integers
21:22:59 <FrederikEaton> heh
21:23:17 <Pseudonym> I think I'll take MathWorld's word for it.
21:23:54 <FrederikEaton> give me a URL for group ideals
21:25:48 <Pseudonym> Can't find one, but they're pretty much defined the same as ring ideals.
21:26:58 <Pseudonym> Ah, lookup "quotient group" on Wikipedia.
21:27:21 <FrederikEaton> there are normal subgroups...
21:27:25 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:27:27 <Pseudonym> They're ideals.
21:27:33 <Pseudonym> Cognate to, anyway.
21:27:40 <Pseudonym> They play the same role.
21:27:52 <Pseudonym> But they're only usually called ideals in Lie group theory.
21:28:10 <Pseudonym> I'm still looking for a good way of describing ideals / normal subgroups categorically.
21:28:17 <Pseudonym> If you ever find a way, let me know. :-)
21:28:29 <gzl> hmm
21:28:56 <Pseudonym> The problem is, I'm not sure how to define them without reference to homomorphism kernels.
21:29:04 <gzl> why would you want to define them without?
21:29:17 <Pseudonym> gzl: Sorry?
21:29:51 <gzl> sorry, i probably misunderstood what you were trying to say.
21:29:58 <FrederikEaton> i always thought of them as preimages of 0
21:30:16 <gzl> sure, normal subgroups are
21:30:22 <Pseudonym> That's what I thought too.  Which makes me thing that categorically, you need a "null object".
21:30:28 <Pseudonym> i.e. an object which is both initial and terminal
21:30:47 <FrederikEaton> ... but are you sure they aren't called ideals because you're dealing with something that has a ring structure?
21:30:49 <Pseudonym> (Or is that "zero object"?)
21:31:03 <FrederikEaton> null object
21:31:08 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:31:47 <Pseudonym> Well, groups obviously don't necessarily have a ring structure.
21:31:59 <FrederikEaton> do lie groups?
21:32:06 <Pseudonym> Not usually.
21:32:14 <Pseudonym> That I'm aware of.
21:32:18 <FrederikEaton> hmm.
21:32:28 <gzl> the definition of a lie group only expects a group structure
21:32:33 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:32:44 <FrederikEaton> i'm just wondering why they would confuse the terminology
21:33:00 <gzl> which terminology?
21:33:07 <Pseudonym> I don't think it's confusing.  Ideals play the same role in each structure.
21:33:09 <FrederikEaton> ideal vs. normal subgroup
21:33:12 <Pseudonym> And they have the same meaning, more or less.
21:33:23 <Pseudonym> The only difference is what the homomorphisms look like.
21:33:39 <gzl> they do, but it's confusing because the convention is for ideals to be in the context of rings
21:33:41 <Pseudonym> WHich brings us back to category theory. :-)
21:34:40 <gzl> hm
21:34:50 <gzl> Fulton-Harris uses normal subgroups for Lie groups and ideals for Lie algebras
21:34:58 <Pseudonym> That makes sense.
21:35:04 <gzl> sure
21:35:13 <gzl> but aren't you saying ideal with Lie group?
21:35:33 <Pseudonym> Not having a reference in front of me, I can't say for sure.
21:35:37 <Pseudonym> You're probably right.
21:35:50 <FrederikEaton> that's what i figured
21:35:55 <Pseudonym> Nevertheless, I maintain that the concept of "ideal" in ring theory is pretty much the same as "normal subgroup" in group theory.
21:36:09 <FrederikEaton> enh
21:36:16 <gzl> it is, but what I'm saying is that the convention is to use ideal only for ring theory, even though the concept is analogous.
21:36:40 <Pseudonym> True, Lie algebras are rings, aren't they.
21:36:47 <Pseudonym> Rings plus the Lie bracket.
21:36:49 <fraxtal> oh my, I am missing the algebra discussion
21:37:06 <gzl> no, they're not rings
21:37:13 <gzl> but they share a lot of the language
21:37:25 <gzl> at least that's my understanding, i don't know much about lie algebras at all
21:37:28 <FrederikEaton> gzl: why not?
21:37:33 <FrederikEaton> aren't they algebras?
21:37:44 <Pseudonym> I'm pretty sure that they are.
21:37:48 <gzl> yes but not necessarily associative
21:37:51 <gzl> according to wikipedia
21:38:09 <Pseudonym> Rings don't have to have an associative multiplication.
21:38:12 <Pseudonym> Sorry, commutative.
21:38:49 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
21:38:51 <gzl> yeah, they do need associative multiplication
21:38:58 <Pseudonym> Yes, associative.
21:39:02 <Pseudonym> Not necessarily commutative.
21:39:09 <gzl> right, but associativity is what the issue is
21:39:18 <FrederikEaton> i see. but there is a generalization of ideals to them
21:39:24 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
21:39:29 <Pseudonym> OK, I'm confusing myself.
21:39:46 <Pseudonym> Lie algebras _can_ have an associative multiplication if the underlying vector space has one.
21:39:54 <Pseudonym> But it _also_ has the nonassociative Lie bracket.
21:40:16 <Pseudonym> In fact, a common way to construct Lie algebras is to take an associative multiplication and define the Lie bracket as the antisymmetric part.
21:40:29 <Pseudonym> [A,B] = 1/2 (AB - BA)
21:40:29 <FrederikEaton> are homomorphisms required to preserve the lie bracket?
21:40:42 <Pseudonym> Erm... think think...
21:40:47 <FrederikEaton> or is this not a restriction
21:40:48 <Pseudonym> Yes.
21:41:02 <Pseudonym> Maybe,.
21:41:28 <Pseudonym> In geometric algebra, homomorphisms preserve outer product, but not necessarily inner product.
21:41:40 <Pseudonym> So in that case, the answer is "yes".
21:41:58 <Pseudonym> So I'd say "yes, probably".
21:42:32 <gzl> yes, i only meant they need not be associative, sorry
21:42:37 * FrederikEaton goes back to work
21:42:57 <lispy> the group theory definition is, h(a)*(b) = h(a+b), where * is the group operation the target group of h, and + is the group operation in the domain of h
21:43:26 <lispy> i think basically, homomorphisms need to protect the structure which is important in your contex
21:43:34 <Pseudonym> And now I discover this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_%28order_theory%29
21:43:39 <reffie>         TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver
21:43:42 <Pseudonym> So there's ANOTHER meaning of "ideal".
21:43:44 <gzl> Pseudonym: yep.
21:43:48 <reffie> errr
21:43:49 <reffie> my bad
21:44:04 <gzl> Pseudonym: though the Stone rep theorem gives a connection between the two in the Boolean case, iirc
21:44:10 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:44:32 <Pseudonym> I need to get back to w*rk, I think.
21:45:03 <Pseudonym> Anyway, I am looking for a way to express ideals / normal subgroups in category theory.  If anyone can think of one, do let me know.
21:48:07 <gzl> Pseudonym: just asked someone. kernels are defined via a universal property, so that should give you the whole thing, no?
21:52:11 <Pseudonym> What universal property?
21:53:17 <gzl> given f : A -> B, ker(f) is a morphism C -> A s.t. for any D -> A whose composition with B is 0, D -> A factors through C
21:53:30 <Pseudonym> Right, so you need zero morphisms.
21:53:35 <Pseudonym> That's what I wanted to know.
21:53:45 <gzl> ok.
21:53:54 <gzl> cool then. :)
21:53:56 <Pseudonym> The other question is: Do quotient objects give you a true "inverse" of category products?
21:54:16 <gzl> i thought quotient objects were dual to subobjects
21:54:21 <gzl> or are you saying something else?
21:56:21 <Pseudonym> In group theory, if N is a normal subgroup of G, then there is a group M such that G =~ M x N
21:56:38 <gzl> ok.
21:56:58 <Pseudonym> So I think if I is a category ideal of G, then G should be able to be "factored" through the category product.
21:57:11 <Pseudonym> G = I x J for some object J.
21:57:16 <gzl> hm.
21:57:20 <Pseudonym> And = is isomorphism, obviously.
21:58:30 <gzl> i thought you could only say that if M and N are both normal in G and M n N = 0 then M x N = G
21:58:52 <gzl> but entirely possible that I forgot about your result
21:59:18 <gzl> er, woops. I mean M x N injects into G
22:00:18 <gzl> sorry if i'm being dense, i'm a bit tired. :)
22:00:45 <Pseudonym> 'Sokay. :_)
22:00:56 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
22:01:11 <Pseudonym> I need to check that if N is a normal subgroup of G, then G/N is a subgroup of G.
22:01:20 <Pseudonym> Now that you mention it, I'm not convinced that this is true.
22:02:20 <gzl> hm, well, maybe it is true, since there is a bijection between all quotients G/H and all homomorphic images of G
22:02:59 <gzl> never mind
22:03:09 <gzl> that doesn't help
22:03:12 <Pseudonym> Oh, I think your condition should read "M n N = 1".
22:03:15 <Pseudonym> Minor point.
22:03:23 <Pseudonym> I know what you meant. :-)
22:03:31 <gzl> yeah :)
22:04:05 <gzl> sometimes i just use 0 for {e}, probably should use 1
22:09:41 <gzl> Pseudonym: maybe the lattice isomorphism helps
22:09:55 <Pseudonym> If you're interpreting {e} as the null/zero object, then 0 works.
22:10:01 <Pseudonym> Yeah, maybe.
22:10:20 <gzl> because you get a bijection between subgroups containing N and subgroups of G/N
22:10:22 <Pseudonym> See, this IMO is the problem with existing universal algebra/category theory books.
22:10:30 <gzl> i wouldn't know. never read any.
22:10:34 <Pseudonym> Ideals/normal subgroups is pretty simple stuff.
22:10:43 <Pseudonym> As these things go.
22:10:47 <gzl> though i was planning on reading lang, which has a categorical treatment
22:10:55 <Pseudonym> You start learning about groups, normal subgroups aren't far behind.
22:11:02 <gzl> right.
22:11:06 <Pseudonym> You start learning about rings, ideals aren't far behind.
22:11:37 <Pseudonym> So what we really want is an "introduction to abstract algebra _using_ category theory".
22:11:47 <gzl> I don't think so
22:11:51 <Pseudonym> Why not?
22:11:53 <gzl> I think that's better suited for a second round
22:12:05 <gzl> because the categories make things much less concrete
22:12:15 <Pseudonym> I envisage lots of examples. :-)
22:12:16 <gzl> I think it would be harder to get a feel for things
22:12:22 <gzl> this is what Lang does
22:12:29 <gzl> but it's a graduate book
22:12:31 <Pseudonym> Which one is Lang?
22:12:57 <gzl> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/038795385X/qid=1115615627/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-9240677-7292667?v=glance&s=books&n=507846
22:13:20 <Pseudonym> Right.
22:13:32 <gzl> that book uses a pretty categorical style
22:14:05 <gzl> what's nice about it is that it assumes prior exposure to basic algebra, so the examples can be more interesting even at the beginning
22:14:18 <Pseudonym> The algebra book I used was Mac Lane and Birkhoff which ironically did not have a categorical style.
22:14:48 <gzl> that's because it's a more elementary book where categories are less suited (IMHO)
22:15:04 <Pseudonym> Yeah, but it's ironic since Saunders Mac Lane invented category theory.
22:15:27 <gzl> yes, I know. :)
22:15:37 <Pseudonym> Oooh, he's got an autobiography out later this year.
22:15:40 <gzl> but at least he had the sense not to throw it in everywhere.
22:15:55 <gzl> ah, nice. there is some stuff on him in Halmos' (they were in the same department).
22:17:01 <skew> Pseudonym: an autobiography in categorical style would be pretty wierd
22:17:21 <Pseudonym> It would be, yes.
22:17:48 <Pseudonym> Actually, I quite like technical biographies.
22:17:55 <gzl> what are some good ones?
22:17:57 <gzl> I've only read Halmos
22:18:00 <gzl> which is quite good
22:18:02 <Pseudonym> They're pretty damn rare, though.
22:18:55 <gzl> oh, of course there's Feynman
22:19:08 <Pseudonym> Yeah, those books are pretty good.
22:19:11 <gzl> but I can't think of other good ones. I don't know if Wiener's or Rudin's are any good.
22:19:19 <gzl> Hardy's is supposed to be good.
22:19:29 <Pseudonym> There are a few on Einstein.
22:19:38 <gzl> yeah, I read one of those.
22:19:39 <Pseudonym> Oh, there's the one on Turing.
22:19:42 <gzl> enigma?
22:19:45 <Pseudonym> Yes.
22:19:50 <gzl> worth reading?
22:19:51 <Pseudonym> I found that a bit hard going, though.
22:19:53 <Pseudonym> But worth it.
22:19:57 <gzl> i have it but haven't read it
22:20:21 <Pseudonym> Dirac: A Scientific Biography
22:20:27 <Pseudonym> That one is good.
22:20:34 <Pseudonym> If you're into physicists.
22:20:37 <gzl> I've been wanting to read Grothendieck-Serre Correspondence but better after I get some AG under my belt
22:20:57 <Pseudonym> The one I'd most like to read, if there was one (which there isn't) is Emmy Noether.
22:21:11 <gzl> yeah, that would be a good one
22:21:12 <Pseudonym> She looks like a fascinating person.
22:21:25 <Gahhh> there is one I thought
22:21:41 <gzl> serre should write an autobiography
22:22:24 <Pseudonym> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038713610X/
22:22:28 <Pseudonym> OK, I think I need to read that.
22:22:40 <Pseudonym> It looks kinda short.
22:22:49 <gzl> I've seen that
22:22:56 <gzl> I didn't think it was all that interesting
22:23:00 <Pseudonym> Damn.
22:23:00 <gzl> it's ok.
22:23:03 <Gahhh> Pseudonym: oops sorry. It was just this article: http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire200504210758.asp
22:23:10 <gzl> oh!
22:23:21 <gzl> have you seen Dieudonne's History of Algebraic Geometry?
22:23:23 <Pseudonym> I see a biography of Noether here, but it's 64 pages.
22:23:27 <Pseudonym> No...
22:23:30 <Pseudonym> That sounds interesting.
22:23:31 <gzl> it's ... unreadable.
22:24:09 <gzl> you'll see if you take a look. but I've been told Bourbaki's history chapter in their commutative algebra book is good
22:24:17 <gzl> that surely has stuff on Noether
22:24:34 <gzl> it does something like Riemann -> 1950s
22:25:01 * Pseudonym nods
22:25:03 <gzl> oh, there are some references on noether in wikipedia's article on her.
22:25:06 * Pseudonym makes a note
22:25:07 <Pseudonym> Thanks.
22:25:47 <gzl> the dieudonne is like a reminder to himself of what happened
22:26:06 <gzl> i can't imagine any nonspecialist understnading a worthwhile amount of it
22:26:22 <gzl> and not simply what happened in high level terms, he recounts all the technical specifics
22:26:42 <gzl> only without all the explanation, since of course it's not a textbook
22:26:52 <gzl> the result is scary. :)
22:27:23 <Pseudonym> :-)
22:27:38 <gzl> what are you doing with algebra? or just for fun?
22:28:04 <skew> gzl: like beginniners wondering into a discussions about monads and such here?
22:28:25 <Pseudonym> Just for fun mostly, yes.
22:28:37 <skew> Same here
22:28:51 <gzl> skew: sorry, i don't understand your question (?)
22:28:56 <skew> I think it's ever so slightly relevant to understanding algebraic data structures and such
22:29:02 <Pseudonym> I have an ulterior motive, of course, that I want to be a better programmer.
22:29:14 <Pseudonym> And the more I know about maths, the better my programming gets.
22:29:31 <Pseudonym> More or less.
22:29:40 <gzl> yeah, i find math lays a lot of general thinking tools bare. once you're aware of htem, it's easier to use them.
22:29:52 <Pseudonym> Right.
22:30:00 <gzl> skew: i agree, i just didn't understand your question :)
22:30:02 <Pseudonym> Look, here's an example of why I'm interested in ideals.
22:30:18 <Pseudonym> There are many data structures which are best represented in ways that aren't "normalised".
22:30:29 <Pseudonym> Take binary search trees, for example.
22:30:37 <gzl> what do you mean by normalized in that context?
22:30:51 <skew> gzl: The history of algebraic topology that is mostly a topologists note to themselves sounds like it would be absolutely impenetrable to anyone who isn't a topologist themselves
22:30:54 <Pseudonym> There are many binary search trees which represent the same "set" or "dictionary".
22:31:21 <gzl> skew: ah, yes. geometry, not topology, but i get your point now :)
22:31:50 <skew> After a year or two of serious mathematics you get to the point where anybody who hasn't studied mathematics themselves doesn't know any of the words you are using
22:31:51 <gzl> only it's a sad state of a affairs when a book is no more coherent than a rambling irc log.
22:31:55 <Pseudonym> Even if you apply a balance criterion, there is almost always more than one tree which is "balanced" according to the criterion.
22:32:02 <gzl> Pseudonym: yeah
22:32:19 <Pseudonym> So you have an equivalence relation, which shows which trees are "the same".
22:32:22 <gzl> skew: yeah
22:32:26 <gzl> ah, and you mod out by this
22:32:36 <skew> If you are talking about fiber spaces and sheaf bundles and stuff people may not even realize you are talking about mathemtics at all...
22:32:43 <gzl> yeah
22:33:02 <Pseudonym> And the structure (category?) of all binary trees, divided by the equivalence relation, gives you the structure (category?) of "sets" or "dictionaries" thereby represented.
22:33:09 <gzl> right
22:33:29 <skew> Pseudonym: have you read Connor's paper about quotient data types?
22:33:30 <gzl> i've wondered whether there would be any use in having something that was locally like a tree
22:33:38 <gzl> in the topological sense
22:33:39 <Pseudonym> No, but I've read some by Turner.
22:33:55 <Pseudonym> But that's exactly the sort of thing I mean.
22:34:17 <Pseudonym> This sort of maths lets you get a grip on equivalence of structures, and gives you a way to analyse them.
22:34:18 <skew> That was the first time I've seen Kan extensions used in a computer science paper
22:34:31 <gzl> you know what i mean? something analogous to manifolds or sheaves
22:34:54 <gzl> that is not quite as nice as a given data structure, but "locally" looks like one
22:35:16 <gzl> it may just be babble. but it seemed kind of interesting.
22:35:27 <Cale> gzl: perhaps a graph is locally like a tree? :)
22:35:53 <gzl> yeah, you're right. like a tree. but maybe one could generalize it to other structures.
22:36:14 <Pseudonym> The point I'm trying to make, and skew nicely completed the argument for me referring to Conor McBride, is that programmers do this all the time without thinking.
22:36:22 <gzl> in any case, i think it's an interesting perspective
22:36:28 <gzl> Pseudonym: yeah.
22:36:29 <Cale> gzl: the interesting bit would be the transition maps
22:36:40 <Pseudonym> And possibly there's a nicer way to understand it, possibly resulting in better representations.
22:36:49 <gzl> yeah
22:37:20 <Pseudonym> A good example of this is what physicists would call "gauge theories".
22:37:32 <gzl> what's a good book to learn category theory for use in algebra? i don't need to go nuts with categories, but i'd like to be good with the basics
22:37:50 <Pseudonym> If you have a representation that isn't "normalised", that has some freedom, then you can use the freedom to your advantage.
22:38:25 <Cale> gzl: perhaps have a look at "Categories for the Working Mathematician"
22:38:34 <gzl> you think that's not too much stuff?
22:38:39 <Pseudonym> That's not bad, but it is a bit heavy on the topology.
22:38:42 <Pseudonym> IMO
22:38:56 <Pseudonym> But it does cover the algebra stuff pretty well.
22:38:58 <gzl> ok
22:39:13 <gzl> the algebra books I have should cover the basics well
22:39:24 <gzl> but I'll look at this for more
22:39:47 <gzl> any others?
22:40:21 <fraxtal> I'm reading a book on topology now
22:40:27 <fraxtal> it's really interesting
22:40:38 <gzl> munkres?
22:42:18 <gzl> anyway, time for bed. later. thanks for the recommendation.
22:42:26 <Cale> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0821816462/104-1400049-6443105?v=glance -- heh, the "Customers interested in Algebra may also be interested in" section is a little misplaced
22:47:16 <skew> I should send some of my algebra problems to these homework solver people ;)
22:47:35 <Gahhh> Cale: Is that a good book ?
22:47:59 <Pseudonym> I looked up books on shell programming once, and it suggested books about acoustic shells.
22:52:01 <Cale> Gahhh: I don't know
22:53:38 <Cale> Seems to be getting pretty good reviews
