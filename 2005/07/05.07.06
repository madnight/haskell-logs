00:00:15 <Itkovian> meuning
00:10:47 <Itkovian> hmm, Phillipa's article seems quite suggestive - on the personal level - or did she just come up with comparisons that are common knowledge about BDSM?
00:15:43 <Itkovian> It also seems a tad short, maybe a few examples could make the article more useful than just inviting
00:17:33 <Itkovian> @seen shapr
00:17:34 <lambdabot> I saw shapr leaving #haskell 9 hours, 20 minutes and 37 seconds ago.
00:24:15 <pejo> Itkovian, article? Where?
00:24:43 <Itkovian> tmrwiki
00:34:15 <TFK> Wow. My somewhat naive Python code solved the Lychrel problem in under a second, while my naive Haskell solution (posted yesterday) took a minute and a half in Hugs.
00:34:52 <TFK> earthy, do you have Python installed on your machine?
00:36:41 * ski thaws frozen ice tea in microwave oven
00:36:59 <ski> mmmh :)
00:37:30 <TFK> Itkovian, do you have Python installed on your machine, then?
00:37:42 <Itkovian> yes.
00:38:02 <Itkovian> url?
00:38:36 <TFK> http://rafb.net/paste/results/ktsCk215.html <--- the commented out stuff should be faster
00:38:45 <Itkovian> TFK: did you check earthy's code? or mine?
00:39:03 <TFK> errr... and ignore that fib definition, I uploaded my entire scratchpad >_<
00:39:09 <TFK> Nope, as I said - checked only my naive version.
00:39:17 <TFK> (Which is why I wanted to give it to you ;-)
00:39:33 <TFK> I saw the first iterations of your code, but maybe you have improved them.
00:39:49 <TFK> Meanwhile I'll try compiling my naive solution, see what GHC gives me.
00:40:13 <Itkovian> TFK: I like that pythonian reversing of the number :-)
00:40:29 <TFK> hehe
00:40:38 <TFK> Short, innit? ;-)
00:40:55 <Itkovian> yes.
00:41:11 <Itkovian> so much for strong typing, eh :-)
00:41:40 <TFK> Python is strongly typed. Maybe you mean, "so much for dynamic typing" ;-)
00:42:10 <lament> see, python is clearly better than haskell :)
00:42:26 <TFK> Although the strong typing is a bit of a moot point, because duck-typing is used more often than not o_O
00:42:51 <pejo> TFK, doesn't Python interpreter use JIT, which hugs does not, for example?
00:43:02 <TFK> pejo, my version did not use psyco.
00:43:24 <TFK> (The (A?) JIT for Python.)
00:43:28 <lament> what's duck-typing?
00:43:41 <lament> (and a harder question: what's strong typing?)
00:43:59 <Wed17010> python...
00:44:17 * Wed17010 bursts out in a raging cloud of laughter
00:44:42 <Wed17010> the part about python being better was meant to be funny right?
00:44:52 <TFK> Wed17010, what part?
00:45:11 <Wed17010> lament: see, python is clearly better than haskell :)
00:45:22 <Itkovian> erm, no for static typing ;-)
00:45:24 <TFK> Ah, what lament said.
00:45:37 <Wed17010> yeah sorry, i should have attached a name to my comment
00:45:45 <TFK> lament, duck typing is when you can assign an object of any type that supports .read (and maybe other assorted functions, .readlines?) to sys.stdin.
00:46:17 <TFK> lament, strong typing means that when you give an object a type, it keeps that type, for ever and ever.
00:46:22 <TFK> (Right?)
00:46:28 <Itkovian> lament: more, duck typing is where the type really doesn't matter as long as things can be coerced to the type that is expected
00:46:38 <Itkovian> imho
00:46:43 <Itkovian> correct me if I'm wrong
00:46:46 <TFK> "coerced to the type"?
00:46:51 <lament> TFK: okay, then what language is not strongly typed?
00:46:57 <Itkovian> well ... yeah sort of
00:46:59 <Wed17010> C
00:47:01 <Wed17010> :P
00:47:07 <TFK> lament, I hear that C/C++ aren't.
00:47:15 <ski> TFK : duck typing would be similar to interfaces and typeclasses in ways, then ?
00:47:16 <lament> in C, when you give an object a type, it keeps that type for ever and ever...
00:47:21 <lament> int i;  // always an int
00:47:24 <Wed17010> crap, i keep using google and end up at the site describing the book i ordered....and STILL not delivered
00:47:59 <ski> (hm, ..coerced ..)
00:48:13 <TFK> ski, it is similar, but it doesn't actually check the type. It merely uses the object as if it was the correct type.
00:48:28 <TFK> At least in Python, whether or not the object behaves as expected is left to runtime checking :-/
00:48:42 <xs_> TFK: 1 == True in python? that doesn't seem terribly strong
00:48:54 <Wed17010> what in gods name is a finite convex polyhedron
00:49:02 <TFK> xs_, yeah, the True/False thingie is pretty ugly.
00:49:02 <mflux_> xs_, does that really have something to do with strongness?
00:49:07 <ski> so, interfaces and typeclasses could prolly in some sense be trying to capture duck typing in a type system
00:49:13 * TFK uses sum() on a list of booleans in his solution
00:49:16 <Itkovian> Wed17010: well, we can satrt by stating that it takes up finite space ...
00:49:23 <TFK> ski, not really, no...
00:49:32 <lament> TFK: I'm not sure your definition of strong typing is correct
00:49:33 <mflux_> I think only whether the compiler/interpreter knows the type of all expressions of the program beforehand is the criteria
00:49:36 <Itkovian> Wed17010: and for any two point in it, no line between them point gets outside of the shape
00:49:43 <TFK> It's more like duck-typing is a dynamically-typed-man's interface.
00:49:45 <Wed17010> sure
00:49:47 <ski> Wed17010 : just what it sounds like ..
00:49:49 <lament> TFK: i don't understand how a value would magically change its type mid-prgoram
00:49:50 <Wed17010> thats the convex part
00:49:58 <mflux_> and if it does implicit casting, well that's just something else (convenient maybe)
00:50:07 <Wed17010> i was more interested in the polyhedron part
00:50:09 <TFK> lament, doesn't C/C++ support casting to void and then to whatever?
00:50:22 <lament> TFK: it does. But that doesn't change your value.
00:50:27 <Itkovian> TFK: yes, but the original thingie still holds it's type, no?
00:50:36 <lament> like i said
00:50:39 <lament> int i; // always an int
00:50:44 <TFK> lament, change the value? It changes its type, after all. "In place."
00:50:48 <xs_> mflux_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing -- it seems an ambiguous term, i guess :)
00:51:13 <lament> TFK: the cast can just be viewed as an a->b function.
00:51:13 <TFK> Itkovian, where, in Python or C(++)?
00:51:23 <Itkovian> TFK: in C
00:51:30 <TFK> lament, doesn't the cast mutate the object in question?
00:51:35 <lament> TFK: no
00:51:48 <TFK> Itkovian, I have no idea :-) that is what I heard - if I am wrong, please forgive me ^_^;
00:51:53 <TFK> no?
00:52:01 <TFK> Well, sucks to be me :-/
00:52:08 <lament> wow that wikipedia page is horrible
00:52:15 <Itkovian> TFK: a cast temporarily makes a different type of object, but the original thing, if you use it one the next line of code, still has the original type
00:52:16 <lament> 9 definitions :)
00:52:25 <lament> let's see how python fares
00:52:35 <Itkovian> lament: clean it up then :-)
00:52:56 <TFK> "Programming language expert Benjamin C. Pierce has said:
00:52:57 <Wed17010> cast to void* looks more like a function a -> .......
00:52:57 <TFK>     I spent a few weeks . . . trying to sort out the terminology of "strongly typed," "statically typed," "safe," etc., and found it amazingly difficult. . . . The usage of these terms is so various as to render them almost useless. "
00:53:16 <Itkovian> yeah
00:53:37 <Itkovian> Wed17010: it's a -> TOP
00:53:47 <Itkovian> where TOP is a supertype imo
00:53:51 <TFK> Don't you mean bottom?
00:53:57 <Itkovian> erm, no
00:53:59 <Itkovian> :-0
00:54:00 <TFK> (the value shared among all types?)
00:54:06 <Itkovian> whatever
00:54:07 <lament> under those definitions, python is: weak, weak, strong, weak, weak, weak, weak, strong, weak
00:54:16 <Wed17010> the type consistent with every other type
00:54:17 <Itkovian> you understand what I mean, that will be sufficient
00:54:19 <lament> :)
00:54:23 <TFK> lament, Python is... weak?! ;_;
00:54:32 <Itkovian> we all are weak :-)
00:54:37 <TFK> What a meanie :-/
00:54:47 <lament> TFK: pick your favourite definition.. one under which it's strong:)
00:54:56 <Itkovian> haha
00:54:59 <TFK> WEEE!
00:55:14 <lament> definition #3 for example
00:55:16 <TFK> Happiness has reentered my life! :-D
00:55:16 <lament> "A language is strongly typed if it contains compile- or run-time checks for type constraint violations."
00:55:17 <Itkovian> TFK: I'll run yr proggie, a sec.
00:55:31 <lament> somehow that definition doesn't seem very appealing, though.
00:55:47 <Itkovian> tyup, it's faster ;-0
00:55:52 <Itkovian> 1.6 sec vs 4.1
00:55:53 <TFK> well, run-time type checks exist.
00:56:07 <TFK> 1.6 secs? what are the specs of your machine?
00:56:17 <lament> TFK: quite
00:56:31 <lament> TFK: there aren't many languages without compile- OR run-time checks
00:56:35 <lament> that still have a type system
00:56:42 <lament> in fact i don't know a single one.
00:56:44 <TFK> compiled GHC binary with no optimizations = ~10 seconds
00:57:11 <lament> perhaps some BASICs do it
00:57:13 <Itkovian> TFK: care to enlighten me about the make_rev(n) function? does it give back a list, or a value for each iteration of the loop?
00:57:29 <Itkovian> TFK: 1.5GHz G4
00:57:47 <TFK> lament, I hate to admit it, but you have a point o_O
00:58:38 <TFK> Itkovian, make_rev(n) returns a generator object, which stuff can iterate over in a loop. that islice() is the generator version of [:50]
00:58:49 <TFK> So it's basically an emulation of laziness.
00:58:50 <lament> definition 4 is also fun
00:58:56 <lament> "A language is strongly typed if conversions between different types are forbidden"
00:59:02 <TFK> But this time, I can more or less predict the behaviour ;-)
00:59:03 <lament> how exactly would that work.
00:59:07 <ski> (lament : possibly e.g. C64 BASIC)
00:59:20 <Itkovian> TFK: that is due to the 'yield' ?
00:59:27 <lament> ski: this would seem to be more of a property of crappy implementations
00:59:38 <lament> ski: nobody would be insane enough to actually put that in the standard for a language
00:59:41 <ski> heh
01:00:00 <ski> maybe some turing tarpit, then ?
01:00:12 <lament> those usually lack type systems
01:00:18 <TFK> Itkovian, yup. It runs the code up to the yield, yields that value, and "freezes" the function. When it's called next it again runs the code up to the yield, and so on.
01:00:35 <dons> anyone know of a platform where sizeof(void *) < sizeof(int)
01:00:36 <Itkovian> cool. but then why the while 1 ?
01:00:44 <Wed17010> i think definition 4 refers to implicit conversions
01:00:44 <TFK> When the function exits but doesn't hit a yield, it raises StopIteration (which a for loop catches implicitly)
01:00:49 <Wed17010> otherwise it wouldnt make sense
01:01:10 <TFK> Itkovian, because I want it to generate all values. I will later take only 50 with islice, but I don't want to constrain make_rev.
01:01:13 <lament> actually tcl i think is a language like that
01:01:18 <lament> also bash and other such things
01:01:21 <mflux_> wed17010, but then there's rule 5
01:01:25 <Itkovian> TFK: ok, I grok it
01:01:30 <TFK> Itkovian, similar in spirit to the infinite makeRev n = ns where ns = (n + (revNum n)):[n + (revNum n) | n <- ns]
01:01:35 <pejo> lament, were you the one asking for language where something changes type all the sudden? Perl - using bless on a reference makes it an object iirc.
01:01:35 <mflux_> wed17010, which explicitly mentions implicit conversions
01:01:54 <lament> pejo: oh
01:01:55 <Itkovian> TFK: you mean when the function is re-entered it is not executed from the start again, merely from the point where it paused after the yield.
01:02:10 <Wed17010> hmmm
01:02:13 <mflux_> pejo, also $foo = "bar"; $foo = &code; ?
01:02:13 <lament> pejo: wow :)
01:02:20 <mflux_> if that was the syntax
01:02:20 <TFK> Itkovian, that's a fair description.
01:02:37 <lament> always trust Perl to be totally wacky
01:02:38 <Itkovian> cool
01:02:43 <TFK> "bless"? Is that an actual language statement? o_O
01:02:48 <mflux_> anyway
01:02:54 <Itkovian> hey come on, what other languages allows you to bless yr stuff, eh
01:02:57 <pejo> TFK, thats how you create objects.
01:03:03 <TFK> :-D
01:03:11 <mflux_> anyway, what about foo = new String("hello");  new foo = new Bar(42); ?
01:03:27 * Itkovian casts a blessing
01:03:39 <mflux_> I guess foo still has the same type which is neither of those, but their common parent class (such as Object in java)
01:03:48 <mflux_> but then again the actual type can be retrieved with dynamic casting
01:04:50 <lament> mflux_: no
01:05:01 <lament> the type of foo doesn't change, and the type of objects it points to doesn't either
01:05:23 <lament> the definition says, "A language is strongly typed if the type of its data objects is fixed"
01:05:43 <lament> foo is just a reference
01:05:59 <TFK> 4 secs for -O2 GHC-compiled binary of my naive Haskell solution.
01:07:22 <ski> "A language is strongly valued if the value of its data objects is fixed" ?
01:07:49 <TFK> (Less than a second for the simplistic generator solution in Python, to remind you ;-)
01:07:58 <lament> ski: that would make more sense
01:08:04 <ski> :)
01:08:05 <lament> TFK: python <3
01:08:24 <TFK> And I'd say that my quick-and-dirty optimisations will make it even faster. Although Psyco is unlikely to speed it up, because it doesn't handle generators.
01:09:27 <TFK> Itkovian, did you time it against the fastest code that you and earthy could come up with?
01:09:34 <Itkovian> holy crap http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/space/07/04/deep.impact.sues.reut/
01:09:35 <TFK> Also, Hugs is damn slow o.o;
01:09:56 <TFK> That's so last week :-/
01:09:57 <Itkovian> TFK: well, I don't know if it's the fastest, but it was the implementation we liked :-)
01:10:03 <Itkovian> ouch
01:10:05 <Itkovian> sorry
01:13:16 <earthy> it was definitely not the fastest code we could come up with
01:14:02 <TFK> earthy, I'm curious to see code just as fast or faster and assess it's prettiness value ;-)
01:16:58 <earthy> ;)
01:17:02 <earthy> just as fast as?
01:17:29 <TFK> My simplistic Python solution o.o
01:18:33 <earthy> ah ;)
01:18:59 <earthy> how does the symplistic Python solution reverse the numbers?
01:19:19 <TFK> int(str(n)[::-1])
01:19:27 <TFK> But I wrapped it in a function call!
01:19:50 <dons> what's [::-1] ?
01:19:50 <lament> hahahaha
01:20:10 <TFK> dons, traverse the string backwards, so to speak
01:20:23 <TFK> Or rather, whatever supports slice notation.
01:20:34 <dons> ah, slice.
01:24:32 <TFK> http://rafb.net/paste/results/1ZKnmh57.html <--- my intuition tells me that this is the fastest variant of my solution. Possibly with psyco. (import psyco; psyco.full())
01:24:38 <Wed17010> omg, the C64 soundtrack cds rule
01:25:00 <ski> Wed17010 : which one ?
01:25:35 <Wed17010> lets see
01:26:19 <Wed17010> from c64audio.com, but i also picked up "C64 - Back in Time" volumes 1,2,3 :D
01:26:48 <ski> nice :)
01:27:01 <Wed17010> it is, some kickass remixes and stuff, good quality mp3s
01:27:05 * ski wants cds too
01:27:16 <Wed17010> giana sisters and sorts....you get the idea :D
01:27:28 <ski> have just some 200 dw single mp3s ..
01:27:43 <ski> Wed17010 : you know about RKO, yes ?
01:27:46 <Wed17010> dw?
01:27:50 <Wed17010> RKO ?
01:27:51 <ski> downloaded
01:27:53 <Wed17010> enlighten me
01:28:00 <ski> RKO = remix.kwed.org
01:28:33 <Wed17010> i have a hunch that site will occupy me the better half of my evening :D
01:28:35 <Wed17010> lets see
01:29:06 <Wed17010> are those amateur stuff or real prof stuff
01:29:29 <Wed17010> cause these cds i got feature songs by real artists i think, not sure though
01:29:45 <ski> http://remix64.phatsites.de/ is a good accompanion to RKO (more info on tunes)
01:29:58 <ski> both amateur and prof
01:30:23 <ski> some original c64 composers have remixes on RKO, too :)
01:31:10 * ski considers continuing this discussion off channel
01:31:27 <Wed17010> hehe yeah im not sure peeps here appreciate this hehe
01:31:45 <TFK> What's C64? o.o
01:31:58 <ski> Commodore 64
01:32:27 <ski> an old microcomputer
01:33:00 <ski> with ppl doing fresh mp3 remixes of lotsa old game and demo music (and a lot of other stuff is still done with it, too)
01:33:21 * poetix plays the guitar solo from Monty On The Run
01:33:43 <lament> why?
01:33:46 <lament> (are they doing it)
01:33:52 <TFK> Ah, like XT? :-P
01:34:48 <Wed17010> because C64 games kick ass...and their tunes even more...with the awesome SID chipset (totally ahead of its time back then) :D
01:36:09 * poetix widdles excitedly
01:36:18 <lament> oh, nostalgia nuts :)
01:37:41 <Wed17010> i agree with my parents now, it *was* better in the ol' days :P
01:38:07 <TFK> Old geezers.
01:38:19 <ski> lament : yes :)
01:38:50 * ski has pondered implementing an FP on the C64
01:39:12 <Wed17010> ofcourse my ol' days are not my parents ol' days :D
01:39:15 <lament> you people are OLD :)
01:39:20 <poetix> There was a Lisp for the BBC Micro, IIRC
01:39:50 * ski is not old
01:39:58 * Wed17010 neither
01:40:32 <ski> lament : can i ask you what age you are of ?
01:40:39 * poetix is feeling old
01:40:43 <lament> ski: it's not about age :)
01:40:53 <lament> ski: it's about living in the past :P
01:40:54 <ski> it's not ?
01:40:58 <ski> hehe
01:43:22 <Wed17010> what does a topologic sort do with nodes on the same level?
01:43:33 <Wed17010> like (1,2) (1,3) ....
01:43:38 <ski> not specified
01:43:46 <ski> put them in some order
01:43:48 <Wed17010> ah i thought so
01:43:50 <Wed17010> thanks
01:44:09 <earthy> SIDPlay and what's that collection of SID tunes called again
01:44:10 <ski> it's an instance of "don't care nondeterminism"
01:44:13 <earthy> great
01:44:20 <ski> HVSC
01:44:26 <earthy> that one, yeas
01:44:30 <ski> High Voltage Sid Collection
01:44:34 <earthy> very cool stuff
01:44:42 <earthy> music for hours upon hours upon hours on end
01:45:01 <Wed17010> i have HVSC too, but i really need a hardware SID thing for them, because the winamp plugin will not do
01:45:03 <dons> @type Data.Graph.Inductive.Query.DFS.topsort
01:45:05 <lambdabot> forall b
01:45:05 <lambdabot>                  a
01:45:05 <lambdabot>                  (gr :: * -> * -> *).
01:45:05 <lambdabot>               (Data.Graph.Inductive.Graph.Graph gr) =>
01:45:05 <lambdabot>               gr a b -> [Data.Graph.Inductive.Graph.Node]
01:45:05 <ski> :D
01:45:19 <dons> Wed17010, try it out :)
01:45:36 <Wed17010> dons, why use that instead off Data.Graph.topSort
01:45:38 <Wed17010> ?
01:45:57 <lament> when i feel nostalgic, i listen to Bach :)
01:45:59 <ski> Wed17010 : SIDPlay. also there's winamp plugin, sidplug iirc  (there's one for xmms also, iirc)
01:46:02 <dons> oh, no reason. just been using the fgl library lately
01:46:30 <Wed17010> good, im going to use it...is it any good? or did you wish you started using a different one?
01:46:50 <stefanw> ah, graph library again :-)
01:46:55 <dons> hehe :)
01:47:05 <Wed17010> hehe why again?
01:47:19 <ski> Wed17010 : sufficiently good (sidplug, i.e.)  (also, think DeliPlayer can play them ..)
01:47:27 <ski> sorry
01:47:48 <ski> (sidplay is suff. good.   sidplug works, i guess)
01:47:50 <dons> Wed17010, you might want to consider what you're trying to do with the graph, then look at how fgl and the normal Data.Graph are implemented
01:47:58 <dons> maybe Data.Graph is enough for your use
01:48:11 <Wed17010> fgl isnt Data.Graph ?
01:48:33 <Wed17010> hehe still going to but that piece of SID hardware some day :D
01:49:18 <dons> no, there's Data.Graph, based on --   /Lazy Depth-First Search and Linear Graph Algorithms in Haskell/,
01:49:21 <dons> --   by David King and John Launchbury.
01:49:31 <dons> and fgl, based on Erwig's work.
01:51:47 <Wed17010> ow because in the ghc hierarchical overview there's fgl behind the Data.Graph
01:51:52 <Wed17010> so i thought it was one and the same
01:52:03 <dons> Data.Graph.Inductive and Data.Graph
01:52:24 <Wed17010> ow. my bad......alignment error
01:55:10 <Wed17010> thanks
01:58:03 <Wed17010> not very documented package that fgl
01:58:23 <dons> no, it's not.
01:59:18 <dons> needs a good going over with haddock
02:00:34 <poetix> Sounds Pythonesque
02:02:30 <Itkovian> earthy: did you get some additional speedup for the lychrel problem?
02:08:18 <earthy> nope, but I haven't looked at it anymore
02:11:55 <dcoutts> poetix, we need a haskell tool called 'herring' so that that joke will work properly. What should herring do?
02:12:26 <poetix> Something to do with erring...a sort of lint, perhaps?
02:12:44 <dcoutts> Alex the Happy Haddock and his friend the Herring
02:12:45 <poetix> Haskell already has a lint: it's called the type-checker...
02:13:28 * ski hopes it's gonna be red
02:13:44 * earthy hopes it's gonna cut trees
02:13:54 <ski> why not both ?
02:13:59 <xs_> red black?
02:14:19 <ski> as long as it's partly red
02:15:25 <poetix> "Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number"
02:15:57 <poetix> So how do you tell if a number is a Lychrel number, if there's no proof that any Lychrel numbers exist?
02:16:03 <ski> you don't
02:16:20 <ski> you can just tell when a number isn't Lychrel
02:16:35 <ski> (currently)
02:16:53 <poetix> So you do just one reverse+add?
02:17:11 <ski> ?
02:17:40 <poetix> The challenge is to count Lychrel numbers. In order to do that, you have to be able to determine whether a number is a Lychrel number or not...
02:17:43 <TFK> dcoutts, your fixes don't require gdk_threads_enter/leave, right?
02:17:46 <ski> depends. if that gives a palindrome, you're done, if not, keep reverse-adding
02:17:52 <poetix> Indefinitely?
02:18:15 <poetix> When do you stop reverse-adding?
02:18:29 <ski> at least if you don't have a way of deciding the Lychrel-number property
02:18:37 <ski> when you have found a palindrome
02:18:38 <ski> :)
02:18:50 <TFK> Trying to beat my Python solution? :-P
02:18:56 <poetix> Of course
02:19:07 <poetix> But I don't understand the problem - it seems unsolvable as stated
02:19:13 <ski> so, being a non-Lychrel number is an observable property
02:19:19 <TFK> poetix, 50 iterations is enough.
02:19:33 <TFK> Indeed, so consider it as finding potential Lychrel numbers.
02:19:37 <Itkovian> poetix: it's the same as with primes ... once you have tries sufficient denominators, you decide that a number is prime, though it might be that you've missed
02:19:58 <TFK> Itkovian, unless you use a smarter algorithm o.o;
02:20:07 <poetix> Surely not - I can determine with 100% certainty whether or not a number is prime.
02:20:40 <Itkovian> TFK: in any case, afaik, even the smartest algorithms can not state 100% certain that a number is prime unless they tried all denomintors up to sqrt(x)
02:20:52 <poetix> If we do 50 iterations, we might get some false positives
02:21:00 <Itkovian> poetix: even for a few thousand digit numbers?
02:21:28 <Itkovian> poetix: for numbers under 10K, 50 iterations yield the same result as 1000 iterations, which need not mean anything but still ...
02:21:35 <TFK> Itkovian, I believe that a deterministic algorithm for primality testing was shown to be in P. Whatever that means.
02:21:55 <TFK> (AFAIK it means that it runs in polynomial time. Right?)
02:22:00 <poetix> So really we're looking for might-be-Lychrel numbers
02:22:03 <Itkovian> TFK: well, yes ... divide by all possible numbers smaller than sqrt(x)
02:22:26 <poetix> And we'll accept the possibility of false positives
02:22:26 <TFK> You are making me search the Wikipedia :-/
02:22:36 <Itkovian> but neat algo's try to do faster and yield primes with 99.999 certainty, no?
02:22:55 <Itkovian> @wikipedia primes
02:22:57 <lambdabot> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primes
02:23:12 <poetix> Do we even know what percentage certainty we have with maybe-Lychrels? I guess we can't, if we can't say for sure that a candidate is *really* a Lychrel number
02:23:31 <Itkovian> TFK: you're right. cool.
02:23:34 <TFK> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test#Fast_deterministic_tests
02:24:16 <TFK> poetix, I don't think we can. Now stop philosophizing and start coding ;-)
02:24:22 <poetix> It seems as if the test is really to eliminate all the non-Lychrel numbers that are observable after a given number of iterations
02:24:45 <poetix> Which is definitely not the same as actually counting the Lychrel numbers, since we can't even definitively identify them
02:27:53 <tromp> you can only count lily numbers
02:28:11 <tromp> likely lychrel
02:28:26 <Itkovian> yes.
02:28:45 <poetix> IS there a different source for the challenge than http://www.mathschallenge.net/index.php?section=project&ref=view&id=55 ?
02:28:45 * ski is reminded of Synthetic Topology (i.e. http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2004-June/014134.html)
02:28:48 <Itkovian> I wonder how the number of iterations relate to the certainty that a number could be Lychrel.
02:29:04 <Itkovian> Syn what?
02:29:10 <poetix> thetic topology
02:29:16 <poetix> ;)
02:29:31 <Itkovian> :-)
02:29:44 <Itkovian> poetix: I don't know ...
02:29:48 <Itkovian> does it matter?
02:29:51 <ski> building topology on computable functions
02:29:58 <Itkovian> hmmm
02:30:02 <Itkovian> sounds weird
02:30:08 <ski> (and semi-computable)
02:30:31 <poetix> It's just that that page states the problem as counting actual Lychrel numbers - I wondered if it was stated differently elsewhere.
02:30:49 <Itkovian> It would be cool to have a graph showing the collapse of the number onto the Lychrel threads ... if you understand me
02:31:00 <Itkovian> poetix: wikipedia?
02:31:07 <Itkovian> @wikipedia Lychrel
02:31:08 <lambdabot> No result found.
02:31:13 <Itkovian> hmm
02:31:22 <Itkovian> @wikipedia Lychrel number
02:31:23 <lambdabot> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number
02:31:26 <poetix> I was wondering what TFK's source was - I thought he was doing the Euler problems at mathschallenge
02:31:51 <Itkovian> It is conjectural (rather than proven) that these are Lychrel numbers.
02:31:57 <Itkovian> poetix: yes, he is.
02:32:08 <Itkovian> seems like neat problems for Haskell students
02:32:16 <ski> iirc, a Hausdorff space (some topology concept) means there that apartness is observable on a datatype   (i.e. there exists a function   notEq :: T -> T -> Bool   which is guarranteed to terminate if the two args are not the same.  think e.g. of possibly infinite streams/lists)
02:32:18 * Itkovian will use several in his lessons next year
02:32:58 <Itkovian> @wikipedia Haussdorf space
02:33:03 <lambdabot> No result found.
02:33:13 <Itkovian> @wikipedia Hausdorff space
02:33:14 <lambdabot> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space
02:33:23 <poetix> Is the answer that all of the numbers below 10,000 are observably non-Lychrel numbers? Do you just have to write a program to do the observing?
02:33:25 <Itkovian> I should learn to type correctly
02:33:27 <TFK> poetix, that was my source indeed.
02:33:48 <Itkovian> poetix: no, the answer is that there are 249 possible Lychrel numbers
02:33:53 <Itkovian> at most
02:34:39 <poetix> And for a number of iterations between 50 and many tens of thousands, that number doesn't change?
02:34:55 <ski> Itkovian : that page possibly will not be much understandable to you, unless you happen to know some topology
02:35:35 <Wed17010> why do some pdfs look like they were typed with a pre-war typewriter ?
02:35:49 <poetix> Bad conversion from ps
02:35:53 <Muad_Dibber> because they were and then were scanned in?
02:35:55 <ski> Itkovian : the paper referenced in the thread on the haskell mailing list is more understandable to haskell programmers, at least the initial parts  (he uses haskell as example language for implementing his stuff)
02:36:14 <Wed17010> from 1991...i dont think they used pre-war typewriters and scanned it in
02:36:49 <ski> (Itkovian : Synthetic topology of data types and classical spaces  http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/papers/entcs87.pdf (or .dvi or .ps))
02:36:59 <Wed17010> ah the ps looks fine indeed
02:38:39 <ski> more or less, he starts with the concept of observable/semi-decidable property, one which is guarranteed to terminate, if the answer is True (but not required to terminate otherwise)
02:38:40 <Itkovian> Ok, I have a question for you lot ... I am looking for riddles related to the number three, to be solvable using pen and paper. Any idea where I might look?
02:39:17 <Itkovian> ski: it's not because the implementation is in haskell that I'd understand what he talks about ;-)
02:39:32 <pejo> Wed, http://cheetah.csl.uiuc.edu/~lqian/tut_ps2pdf.html
02:40:05 <Itkovian> ski: I've already have too much to read ... which brings me to my next question.Did any of you read the LtU post on paper organisation, if yes, what do you use for it?
02:41:21 <ski> Itkovian :  :)  i guess i just wanted to say that he starts with a programming/computing viewpoint, and what his ideas have to to with that
02:41:45 <ski> Itkovian : well, i don't use anything very good
02:42:32 <Itkovian> neither do I
02:42:35 <pejo> Itkovian, I tried citeulike, love it. After just adding a few of papers laying around on disk I've already found duplicates since I have a tree structure in my home directory.
02:42:47 <ski> sometimes i get this citeseer craze where i start by downloading one or two papers, but then find links to other (on citeseer), and starts downloading these, and so on :/
02:42:59 <ski> citeseer is dangerous !
02:43:00 <Itkovian> citeseer does that to people
02:43:21 <earthy> been there, done that
02:43:32 <earthy> I'm in a paper reading binge again anyway
02:44:12 <Wed17010> pejo, why dont researchers just run pdftex and there's no prob?
02:44:20 <ski> pejo : maybe i ought to get my lazy bum off the chair and try citeulike out
02:46:07 <pejo> Wed17010, do you expect me to be able to answer that question?
02:48:23 <Wed17010> it could have been te case that you have thought about it too maybe?
02:49:03 <Wed17010> or you might have known a common objection against pdflatex
02:49:50 <Wed17010> i have too high expectations
02:49:57 <Wed17010> sometimes, i know
02:59:30 <dons> maybe we should have @paper as well as @code
02:59:35 <dons> for random PL papers
03:02:54 <TFK> What is the ascii code for the GHCi session-terminating char?
03:03:49 <TFK> ctrl+z under windows
03:04:17 <dons> ^D ?
03:04:50 <dons> 0x04 I think
03:05:03 <dons> who knows if that works on windows
03:05:13 <Enveigler> ctl-Z : 26 decimal
03:05:29 <TFK> ^D is for Linux, but I'm guessing that they denote the same ascii char
03:06:01 <dons> apparently not. 26 /= 4
03:06:08 <TFK> Or not o_O , I'll experiment.
03:06:22 <TFK> @index chr
03:06:23 <lambdabot> Data.Char
03:06:33 <Beelsebob> lo again
03:06:49 <dons> @plugs ord '\^Z'
03:06:50 <lambdabot> 26
03:06:51 <dons> @plugs ord '\^D'
03:06:52 <lambdabot> 4
03:07:14 <dons> \^Z would suspend ghci on unix, I suspect
03:09:53 <TFK> in runInteractiveCommand, when a process exits, do the in/out/err handlers close?
03:10:22 <TFK> er, runInteractiveProcess
03:10:34 <dcoutts> TFK, re: gdk_threads_enter/leave, yes that's right, they're not required
03:10:45 <TFK> great :-)
03:11:07 <TFK> I'm writing a frontend to GHCi now with Gtk2Hs, that should excersize it for bugs a little more ;-)
03:11:43 <dcoutts> TFK, it was just a bug in the marshaling for the onInsertText callback
03:11:58 <dcoutts> TFK, that sounds cool :-)
03:12:24 <TFK> As long as software exists, bugs will exist, haunting both users and programmers alike, for ever and ever.
03:12:31 <dcoutts> btw there's a slightly better way of doing threading that doesn't use 100% cpu time
03:12:38 <TFK> </doomsdayprophecy>
03:13:02 <TFK> forkIO uses 100% CPU power?!
03:13:18 <dcoutts> swap "idleAdd (yield >> return True) priorityDefaultIdle" for "timeoutAddFull (yield >> return True) priorityDefaultIdle 100"
03:13:24 <TFK> (In the context of GTK)
03:13:32 * TFK does so
03:13:49 <dcoutts> no, forkIO is fine, it's the naff polling system we've got to use at the moment
03:13:51 <musasabi> Has anyone else problems with the attribute grammer article in tmrwiki?
03:14:09 * ski goes to read it
03:14:45 <dcoutts> TFK, we need better support from the GHC RTS to do threads in GUI libs properly. Both Gtk2Hs and wxHaskell have this problem.
03:16:29 <dcoutts> TFK, you can adjust that timeout number (100), anything from 20 to 200 would be reasonable.
03:16:46 <musasabi> just shows a permission error for me..
03:17:02 <TFK> Well, as I said before, to help convince the GHC devs I can marshal my trusty pitchfork.
03:17:05 * TFK nods
03:17:24 <TFK> musasabi, another person reported that yesterday. shapr can fix it, if he's here :-/
03:17:28 <ski> dcoutts : bound threads ??
03:17:58 <musasabi> ok
03:18:03 <ski> @summon shapr
03:18:03 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
03:18:08 <ski> bah
03:18:12 <kzm> Are there any rules of thumb as to when to use a record of functions, and when to use a class?
03:18:23 * kzm is weighing the alternatives.
03:18:45 <TFK> Could not find module `Distribution.Compat.FilePath':
03:18:46 <TFK>   it is hidden (in package Cabal-1.0)
03:18:56 <TFK> How do I import it, then?
03:19:11 <ski> record of functions allow alternate "instances" for the same type while using typeclasses requires just on instance (so one can e.g. make a newtype ..) ?
03:21:31 <kzm> Ah, yes.
03:22:44 <ski> also, in some cases, record of members requires extensions of Haskell98 (e.g. local quantification), while using a typeclass can be standard
03:23:02 <ski> (e.g. Functor,Monad)
03:24:07 <ski> and of course the obvious, with typeclasses dictionaries (infers and) propagates automatically. with records, not
03:29:44 <kzm> OK, and thanks.  I also wanted the default class members for simple cases, but I can just as easily write a constructor function for my record.
03:30:00 <kzm> (that "derives" the functions from each other)
03:30:28 <dcoutts> ski, re: bound threads, sadly they don't help :-(
03:30:44 <ski> mhm
03:31:01 * ski just read (a little) about bound threads today
03:31:25 <dcoutts> ski, they allow you to fork a thread bound to a *new* OS thread. We need to fork a thread bound to an *existing* OS thread.
03:31:39 <TFK> Hmm. I forked GHCi, and it seems to run fine, but never shows the actual prompt o_O
03:32:04 <ski> kzm : you could of course experiment with implicit parameters for the records, too. so you don't have to propagate them explicitely
03:32:23 <ski> dcoutts : ok
03:33:01 <dcoutts> ski, because most GUI libs are only single threaded so all GUI calls from Haskell have to occur in one OS thread, so if we fork multiple Haskell threads and want to use GUI calls from them then they'd better be bound to the main GUI OS thread
03:34:06 <ski> hm, one can't set up a bound thread and make it rendezvous for the threads wanting GUI calls ?
03:34:27 <TFK> Why does the forked-off process not die when the app dies?
03:34:32 <TFK> *parent app
03:34:53 <ski> TFK : which forked-off process ?
03:35:00 <TFK> ghci
03:35:14 <TFK> Guess I'll kill it the unsafe way.
03:35:21 <TFK> For now, since it doesn't respond to input at all.
03:35:47 <dcoutts> ski, you mean have a haskell thread transfer requests for GUI calls to another thread?
03:36:30 <ski> dcoutts : yes. (just a thought. no idea if it could work)
03:37:03 <dcoutts> it can be made to work, but it doesn't make the gui programming very natural
03:37:04 <ski> or, have the haskell bound thread transfer requests to the GUI from other threads
03:37:12 <ski> (maybe that's what you said. not sure)
03:37:58 <ski> you have to interface with the GUI anyway. can't you make the GUI functions do this transferring internally ?
03:38:12 <TFK> great, manually killing ghci doesn't kill ghc, which ghc apparently invokes.
03:38:27 <dcoutts> and then there's the problem that gui calls tend to be numerous and short lived, so adding thread switching overhead would make it rather slow
03:38:36 <TFK> Does GHCi have any special traits system-i/o wise?
03:38:58 <ski> dcoutts : could maybe be a prob
03:40:24 <dcoutts> ski, previously I hacked up a solution where we 'install' the ghc rts as an event source in the Gtk main loop so it'd give the ghc rts a chance to schedule when otherwise we'd be blocked in the gtk main loop
03:40:54 <dcoutts> it worked sort-of, it'd need a propper interface to the rts
03:41:15 <ski> (dcoutts : btw, i haven't hacked around much at all with GUIs in haskell)
03:41:22 <ski> mhm
03:41:38 <dcoutts> ski, s'ok, not may people have, yet...
03:41:42 <dcoutts> :-)
03:42:28 <TFK> http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/68.html <--- can someone please review and/or run this code and report the results? (Note that it may require killing ghc(i) manually.)
03:45:22 <dcoutts> TFK, we'd need the .glade file if we want to run it
03:45:49 <Itkovian> bach
03:49:01 <TFK> oh, sorry!
03:49:06 <TFK> silly me :-/
03:51:32 <TFK> tfk.is-a-geek.org/guici.rar hope that .rar isn't a problem
03:52:41 <dcoutts> emerge unrar...
03:54:04 <dcoutts> TFK, you missed the .glade from the rar (you included the .gladep)
03:56:08 <TFK> errr
03:57:07 <TFK> OK, now it should be fine. Sorry for omitting it the first time :-(
03:57:13 <dcoutts> np
04:00:31 <dcoutts> TFK, seems to work for me, ghci does terminate when you close the window
04:00:42 <TFK> Linux?
04:00:46 <dcoutts> yes
04:00:55 <TFK> Does it give you the Prelude> prompt? Does it respond to input?
04:01:09 <dcoutts> it's all one one line at the moment :-)
04:01:19 <TFK> What do you mean?
04:01:22 <dcoutts> let me add a '\n' somewhere ...
04:02:01 <TFK> on one line? Srange. At least hte initial output was OK for me.
04:02:11 <dcoutts> the text box only has one line, the hGetLine presumably returns with the '\n' stripped off and then that's just added to the text box
04:02:25 <dcoutts> so there are no new lines added
04:02:59 <TFK> But it doesn't strip them on Windows. That the text box is only one line is by design, since afaik you can't enter multiple lines into the prompt anyway.
04:03:14 <TFK> But I do use hPutStrLn when sending messages.
04:03:41 <dcoutts> no, sorry the TextView shows it all with just one line, the entry box should only be one line high as you say
04:03:52 <dcoutts> ok, fixed: textBufferInsert textbuf enditer (text ++ "\n")
04:04:13 <dcoutts> but no prompt> at the moment
04:04:17 <TFK> So that means that there is a discrepancy somewhere between Linux or Windows, apparently in GHC. That is a bad thing.
04:04:23 <TFK> So it doesn't respond to input?
04:04:26 <dcoutts> no
04:04:32 <dcoutts> Loading package base-1.0 ... linking ... done.
04:04:36 <dcoutts> was the last output
04:04:47 <TFK> Yup, same here. Any ideas on why that might be?
04:05:11 <dcoutts> because it's not a full line of output from ghci
04:05:24 <dcoutts> so hGetLine doesn't return
04:05:42 <dcoutts> because it hasn't seen '\n' yet, only "Prelude> "
04:05:56 <dcoutts> so you can't use hGetLine :-(
04:06:01 <TFK> But it doesn't block the entire application.
04:06:14 <TFK> So after I enter input, it should return, shouldn't it?
04:06:14 <dcoutts> no it doesn't block the GUI
04:06:24 <dcoutts> hmm
04:07:04 <TFK> But if you say that GHCi terminates properly, that means that either GHC closes it properly (and it doesn't on Windows, and that's a bad thing) or it *does* respond to input, because I sent it ^Z.
04:07:12 <TFK> What GHC version do you have?
04:07:15 <dcoutts> 6.4
04:07:41 <TFK> Same here. Hmmm. Well, I just used hGetContents and it doesn't work o_O
04:07:44 <dcoutts> on unix it probably just terminates because the pipe was closed or its parent process terminated
04:07:51 <TFK> hGetChar, then?
04:07:57 <dcoutts> hmm
04:08:09 <TFK> Ah, so maybe it's a pure-Windows problem, not GHC's?
04:08:47 <TFK> Woa, this is strange. Now ghci terminated. This will take some time to figure out :-/
04:10:48 <TFK> OK. Using hGetChar printed Prelude> but did not respond to input and did not terminate ghci
04:11:11 <Wed17010> whats so functional about xslt ? the processing engine behind it?
04:11:23 <Beelsebob> nothing is functional about it
04:11:32 <Beelsebob> it's horrible
04:12:14 <Wed17010> i heard someone say, its a functional language
04:12:23 <Wed17010> so im interested to know why
04:12:27 <Wed17010> cduce i know is functional
04:12:32 <Wed17010> but xslt....
04:12:39 <Wed17010> wheres earthy when you need him
04:12:39 <Wed17010> :D
04:12:57 <dcoutts> Wed17010, it's sort of functional, what Beelsebob means is that it's horrible, not that it isn't functional :-)
04:12:57 <Beelsebob> um... if it's a functional language, I'm the emperor
04:13:08 <earthy> hm?
04:13:29 <earthy> in his room, where else...
04:13:49 <Wed17010> it is
04:13:54 <jlouis> xslt is rather irritating
04:13:56 <Beelsebob> in what way?
04:13:59 <dcoutts> well xslt has no imperiitive control structures, no updateable variables
04:14:02 <Beelsebob> it executes line by line
04:14:03 <TFK> flushing ins. !
04:14:06 <earthy> xslt is basically a term rewriting language
04:14:14 <Beelsebob> hmm... I suppose
04:14:18 <Wed17010> earthy, so the processing engine behind it makes it functional?
04:14:23 <Beelsebob> but it's certainly not reduction based
04:14:25 <earthy> therefore, in a sense, a functional language
04:14:55 <Wed17010> you just say apply templates and look the engine go
04:15:27 <earthy> but a template is not much more than a redex-match and a corresponding rewrite
04:15:57 <TFK> IT WORKS!
04:16:10 <earthy> what? xslt? for certain values of works....
04:16:14 <dcoutts> Wed17010, I'd say it the specification of the language which makes it functional rather than the processing engine behind it
04:16:14 <Wed17010> so should i look into cduce instead :D or are there even cooler alternatives (dont say stratego)
04:16:22 <dcoutts> TFK, what did you do?
04:16:25 <TFK> I got the powa!
04:16:29 <dcoutts> :-)
04:16:30 <earthy> I was going to say stratego. :P
04:16:33 <TFK> dcoutts, hSetBuffering ins NoBuffering
04:16:39 <dcoutts> ah
04:16:43 <Wed17010> stratego is not a cool alternative in my book
04:16:48 <earthy> but now I won't.
04:16:48 <Wed17010> :)
04:17:08 <TFK> Now I have to figure out how to properly get text from outs.
04:17:24 <dcoutts> TFK, hmm doesn't work here...
04:17:30 <Beelsebob> TFK: was it you having problems with nhc last night?
04:17:53 <TFK> dcoutts, I'll send you the reformed version when I figure out the outs problem
04:17:58 <TFK> Beelsebob, never used nhc.
04:18:05 <Beelsebob> m-kay
04:18:13 * Beelsebob tries to remember who it was
04:18:14 <Muad_Dibber> why not?
04:18:27 <TFK> Why yes?
04:18:30 <earthy> anyway, why do you want a transformation language?
04:18:34 <Itkovian> hi beelsebob
04:18:41 <dcoutts> TFK, ok
04:18:42 <Beelsebob> lo
04:18:46 <Beelsebob> ah... it was igloo
04:19:00 <Wed17010> well, its totally awesome :P
04:19:11 <Wed17010> its for transforming data into webpages and what not
04:19:13 <Wed17010> that kind of stuff
04:19:23 <earthy> yeah... Haskell
04:19:35 <earthy> maybe even Generic Haskell with Generic Editor Components for the Web
04:19:44 <Wed17010> i've come to dislike xslt in my assisting period :P
04:19:48 <earthy> and don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. ;P
04:20:03 <Beelsebob> heh... I don't think there's anyone who doesn't
04:20:06 <Wed17010> if you're referring to the nijmegen stuff....yuk
04:20:06 <Wed17010> :P
04:20:14 <earthy> not that yuk
04:20:16 <Wed17010> hehehe
04:20:20 <earthy> one or two good ideas there
04:20:28 <Wed17010> what r. herk. is doing is way cooler
04:20:34 <Wed17010> webobjects in haskell
04:20:43 <earthy> but yeah, the PhD student in that group totally distanced himself from that stuff
04:20:52 <Beelsebob> ohhhh... does that mean that the cocoa bridge is being updated?
04:21:07 <earthy> beelsebob: we're talking re-implementation, not bridge
04:21:11 <Beelsebob> :(
04:21:22 <Wed17010> phd student behind that clean web object generic thingie you mean earthy ?
04:21:25 <Beelsebob> well... cocoa foundation is Haskell would still be very nice
04:21:32 <Beelsebob> s/is/in/
04:22:24 <Beelsebob> is anyone working on HOC these days?
04:22:25 <earthy> PhD student of Rinus Plasmeijer, yeah
04:22:34 <Beelsebob> It hasn't been updated in over a year
04:22:55 <TFK> I get an error on hFlush outs, saying that it is a closed handle. But how can it be if just a line before I used hGetContents on it? Not to mention hSetBuffering?
04:23:31 <Wed17010> that is not a good sign i guess...
04:23:33 <dcoutts> because hGetContents smei-closes the handle
04:23:56 <Wed17010> but is it that big that this dude promoted on it....is r.herk not doing the equal amount of work for his msc instead of phd?
04:23:58 <dcoutts> basically you can't use hGetContents with the other handle functions
04:24:39 <TFK> I see.
04:24:43 <ski> TFK : the handle is sortof lazily closed :)
04:25:07 <TFK> I wouldn't care if hGetContents would actually print something on screen :-/
04:25:10 <earthy> wed17010: nope. the ideas behind WebFunctions are pretty straightforward
04:25:17 <ski> (it will be closed, when the list has been fully forced (or rest of it gets GCed, i think))
04:25:21 <earthy> a msc is roughly 1 paper's worth of work
04:25:37 <dcoutts> TFK, you almost certainly don't want to be using hGetContents for this app
04:25:39 <earthy> getting >1 paper out of WebFunctions would surprise me
04:25:44 <Wed17010> yeah
04:25:46 <Wed17010> me too
04:25:54 * TFK yanks out hGetContents
04:26:04 <Wed17010> vim!!
04:26:39 * Beelsebob showers
04:27:41 <TFK> I can only flush handles that are open for writing?
04:27:51 <dcoutts> sounds reasonable
04:28:07 <dcoutts> flushing is an output thing, not an input thing
04:28:38 <dcoutts> so TFK what are you aiming for in this app? would my VTE bindings be helpful?
04:28:49 <TFK> VTE bindings?
04:28:58 <Wed17010> what would be the semantics of flushing a read handle?
04:29:04 <Wed17010> forcing the reading?
04:29:10 <dcoutts> VTE is the standard gnome terminal widget
04:29:19 * ski thinks the answer is 'no'
04:29:24 <TFK> My goal is to write a frontend to GHCi a la WinHugs.
04:29:31 <TFK> I need it to be cross-platform ;-)
04:29:32 <dcoutts> it's a terminal in a widget, it's the basis for gnome-terminal
04:29:49 <dcoutts> oh, I see, vte is pretty unix specific
04:29:52 <TFK> So yes, I guess that's a "no"...
04:30:31 <TFK> Yup. Meanwhile, it seems that none of the hGet* functions behave nicely.
04:31:00 <TFK> hGetChar would work, but for some reason I get a double newline for every newline from the output.
04:31:03 <ski> combined with hGetContents, or what ?
04:31:11 <Wed17010> semantic subtyping....sounds creepy
04:31:22 <dcoutts> TFK, that's probably because of "\r\n" on windows
04:31:49 <TFK> dcoutts, true, but \r itself shouldn't create a newline, should it?
04:32:08 <dcoutts> in the TextView is probably does
04:32:10 <ski> echoing ??
04:32:20 * TFK thumps TextView
04:32:38 <dcoutts> no, its perfectly reasonable, it should be filtered out eariler
04:32:40 <TFK> ski, I'm trying to get output from a pipe somehow. hGetContents doesn't even print anything.
04:33:00 <TFK> So I should just ignore \r?
04:33:05 <dcoutts> windows is supposed to convert "\r\n" to "\n" when you read in text mode
04:33:20 <dcoutts> you're not using binary mode are you?
04:33:30 <TFK> I don't think so o.o;
04:33:44 <Beelsebob> interesting... anyone ever seen this before:
04:33:45 <Beelsebob> stue4f0:/Volumes/Wheel X/Music/iTunes tatd2$ sudo rm "iTunes Library"
04:33:45 <Beelsebob> Password:
04:33:45 <Beelsebob> rm: iTunes Library: Invalid argument
04:34:21 <ski> sudo 'rm "iTunes Library"'
04:34:21 <ski> ?
04:34:30 <dcoutts> TFK, in that case it's odd that you get "\r\n", you might want to check that that's really what's happening
04:34:46 * TFK nods
04:34:46 <Beelsebob> ski: command not found... unsurprisingly
04:35:01 <ski> hm
04:35:39 <Beelsebob> the file appears not to be a file... chmod 777 iTunes\ Library
04:35:39 <Beelsebob> chmod: iTunes Library: Invalid argument
04:36:23 <TFK> Hmm, apparently it was opening it in binary mode. I explicitly turned it of, and now it works.
04:36:28 <ski> any better ?? : sudo rm '"iTunes Library"'
04:36:39 <TFK> But it feels "sluggish". Doesn't matter much right now, though.
04:36:44 <Beelsebob> no... it didn't change the permissions
04:36:58 <dcoutts> TFK, you can adjust the timeout, try 20ms
04:37:09 <Beelsebob> sudo rm -f '"iTunes Library"' gave no error
04:37:16 <Beelsebob> but it also didn't delete the file
04:37:51 <Itkovian> beelsebob: do you perhaps have iTunes still running?
04:38:00 <TFK> Much faster now, thanks :-)
04:38:00 <Beelsebob> itkovion: nope
04:38:05 <TFK> I'll rar it and upload it.
04:38:05 <Wed17010> lol
04:38:14 <dcoutts> TFK, ok
04:38:20 <ski> rmdir ?
04:38:21 <Wed17010> are you sure itunes is explicitly killed
04:38:22 <Wed17010> :D
04:38:23 <ski> rm -R ?
04:38:30 <Beelsebob> anyway... I was doing this because iTunes was bitching that the music library was not a file
04:38:31 <Wed17010> and its associated processes
04:38:35 <Beelsebob> ski: it's a file
04:38:38 <ski> ok
04:38:49 <Beelsebob> ah... that worked
04:38:58 <Beelsebob> I unplugged the disk, and now it works
04:39:06 <Beelsebob> (having plugged it back in)
04:40:16 <TFK> okie, http://tfk.is-a-geek.org/guici.rar
04:40:49 <TFK> Thanks for your help :-) this thing will grow more meat in time.
04:41:16 <dcoutts> I was just looking up how to change the font to be fixed width
04:42:15 <dcoutts> TFK, error messages are not printed, perhaps because they come out on the error handle rather than the output handle
04:42:59 <dcoutts> they should be printed too (if only because if the error channel is blocked then ghci will eventually stop once the error handle buffer is full)
04:43:43 <dcoutts> TFK, we probably want line wrapping turned on too, character level not word level
04:44:37 <dcoutts> and we'll want control-C to send the appropriate signal to the child app (this would all be done for you with vte... :-) )
04:46:48 <TFK> Oh boy O_O
04:47:07 <dcoutts> :-)
04:47:22 <TFK> I agree about the error messages, but why the line wrapping?
04:47:38 <TFK> Does GHCi rely on per-character wrapping after 80 characters?
04:48:22 <dcoutts> well if I say: take 200 [1..] then it scrolls off the edge of the window and I've got to use the scroll bars
04:48:48 <dcoutts> it'd be more familiar behaviour to use line wrapping
04:49:03 <dcoutts> but no GHCi does not rely on it
04:49:04 <TFK> Good point.
04:50:01 <dcoutts> in fact it'll be better than using GHCi in a terminal since you'll be able to resize the window and have the text re-flow.
04:50:11 <dcoutts> terminals don't typically do that
04:50:35 <Wed17010> geez SID cards are expensive
04:50:48 <dcoutts> TFK, so eventually this'll be part of hIDE 2.x then :-)
04:51:01 <TFK> It will? o.o;
04:51:03 <ski> (Wed17010 : planning on buying the real thing ??)
04:51:09 <TFK> I mean, it will?! :-D
04:51:17 <dcoutts> :-)
04:51:43 <Wed17010> (ski, i was a tat curious what such a thing would cost.)
04:51:46 <TFK> Hehe. Don't put the cart before the horse, etc. ;-) but hopefully there'll be no bus errors!
04:52:13 <dcoutts> indeed
04:52:36 <Beelsebob> YAY!!!!! The Crazy Frog has been banned in Europe!
04:53:06 <Itkovian> eh?
04:53:15 <Beelsebob> hehe... well, not quite
04:53:16 <Itkovian> the GSM sound you mean?
04:53:28 <Beelsebob> but a lot of countries are telling the company selling it to sod off
04:53:45 <Wed17010> it lures little children into a web of money costing things
04:53:49 <Beelsebob> because they're deceptive and don't let you unsubscribe from their 1.20 texts
04:53:55 <Itkovian> I've seen a really horrid video where masked men threaten to mix a chicken if they didn't cease ...
04:54:04 <Beelsebob> haha
04:54:29 <Itkovian> what I hate about GSM messages is that sometimes it costs you for messages sent _to_ you ... how they can get away with that beats me
04:54:35 <Wed17010> ok i apologize, but i wasnt planning on inflicting real damage to the chicken :P
04:54:41 <Itkovian> btw, they mixed the little yellow bird
04:54:42 <musasabi> weird operators.
04:54:56 <musasabi> Here it costs nothing to receive as long as you are inside Finland.
04:55:11 <Beelsebob> yeh, I know... it's like giving them a "take money from us! ticket
04:55:12 <Itkovian> musasabi: you're in Finland?
04:55:19 <Itkovian> say hi to my sis if you see her ;-)
04:56:13 <musasabi> will do :-)
04:57:17 <TFK> dcoutts, do you know if GTK supports entry history?
04:57:31 <TFK> Or history in some kind of widget that can replace an entry.
04:57:36 <Itkovian> how the hll does one load Data.IntMap in ghci?
04:58:13 <musasabi> :mod +Data.IntMap
04:58:32 <dcoutts> TFK, there are drop down combo boxes but I think a history is something you'll have to do yourself
04:58:47 * TFK nods
04:59:04 <TFK> It looks like an interesting feature to implement in Haskell.
04:59:12 <Itkovian> musasabi: thx
04:59:22 <dcoutts> the gtk ones work in a different way (I think)
05:00:41 <dcoutts> TFK, yeah, shouldn't be to hard, it's just a list of strings...
05:01:22 <TFK> "just a list of strings," he said ;-)
05:01:44 <dcoutts> yeah, I can imagine it expanding into a whole bunch of code :-(
05:02:37 * ski associates 'he said' with the game 'Faery Tale'
05:04:47 <poetix> ou est le pastebin?
05:05:34 <poetix> I have some Lychrel-spotting code
05:07:45 <Wed17010> /dev/null
05:07:50 <Wed17010> @pastebin
05:07:51 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
05:07:51 <Wed17010> @paste
05:07:53 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
05:08:01 <dcoutts> TFK, use this to set the font:
05:08:02 <dcoutts>     desc <- fontDescriptionFromString "Monospace 10"
05:08:03 <dcoutts>     widgetModifyFont view (Just desc)
05:08:09 <TFK> poetix, hbin.dyndns.org
05:08:29 <TFK> dcoutts, aye aye
05:09:13 <dcoutts> oh, but sadly that means you need to import Graphics.UI.Gtk.Pango.Description because for some reason it's not exported by default. I'll go fix that...
05:10:17 <TFK> Hmmm, I should put the darcs repo online.
05:12:06 <TFK> Meh, the "errors first" is problematic. It appears that outs gets a single character before errs does.
05:12:20 <TFK> So there's a "P" before the error gets printed out o_O
05:13:52 <poetix> TFK: code is in the pastebin
05:14:07 <TFK> poetix, which pastebin? If in hbin, then paste the url here.
05:14:44 <poetix> http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/69.html
05:15:15 <Wed17010> where are the types people
05:15:29 <TFK> http://hbin.dyndns.org/pastebin/67.html <--- my code is shorter :-/
05:15:42 <TFK> poetix, can you time your solution against my Python one?
05:15:56 <poetix> Not right now (at work) but later maybe
05:16:07 <TFK> http://rafb.net/paste/results/1ZKnmh57.html <-- okie, this is my Python one.
05:16:35 <TFK> Hmm, should I add time-measuring code to it?
05:19:06 <poetix> Mine drops numbers that have already been found to result in palindromes from the search list, which speeds things up a bit
05:19:08 <TFK> This is problematic. somehow the dosbox manages to print it out correctly, but even when using hReady outs gets priority over errs :-/
05:19:56 <TFK> I think that it is a similar approach to earthy's and Itkovian's. Itkovian timed my Python solution, and it was found faster ;-)
05:20:14 <Itkovian> it was :-)
05:20:44 <TFK> My naive solution, compiled with GHC -O2 took ~4 seconds. The Python solution took under 1 second >-)
05:21:06 <TFK> But I am quite suprised that WinHugs is so slow (1.5 minutes iirc).
05:21:50 <Itkovian> I am looking at the IntMap bug ... everything seems normal to me ... maybe it's in the insertion that stuff fails. An
05:21:55 <Itkovian> ybody else taking a peek?
05:26:04 <ski> Wed17010 : types people ?
05:27:45 <Wed17010> ow i was looking at the poetix code in the pastebin, and no single function carried a visible type....
05:27:46 <Wed17010> it shocked me
05:27:48 <Wed17010> :)
05:29:51 <poetix> Let the compiler deal with that stuff
05:30:16 <Beelsebob> no... the point of anotations is to check it's right
05:30:27 <Beelsebob> if you and the compiler disagree, then there's something up
05:30:28 <Wed17010> types are documentation
05:30:37 <Wed17010> and checks for yourself
05:30:38 <Beelsebob> and there's a 50/50 chance it's the code, not the type
05:30:58 <Wed17010> error messages sometimes can be horribly useless without the user providing the types
05:31:07 <Beelsebob> indeed
05:31:12 <poetix> I add type annotations if things go wrong...
05:31:30 <Beelsebob> it's like commenting code - it helps you work
05:31:41 <Beelsebob> the type helps you understand what you're trying to do
05:31:47 <Wed17010> it can also give someone a quick glance of what your function does
05:31:54 <poetix> Oh, quite often I write the types *first* - just not today
05:32:16 <Beelsebob> heh... fair enough... I do that *all* the time
05:32:18 <Beelsebob> but hey
05:32:29 <Wed17010> ah all is not lost poetix
05:32:32 <Wed17010> :)
05:37:02 <Beelsebob> ohh... I think I just proved P=NP
05:37:36 <Beelsebob> damn it... if that can't get chat started... nothing will
05:37:38 <Beelsebob> :(
05:37:57 <TheHunter> how'd you do it?
05:37:57 <aheller> sorry.  Really, Wow!
05:38:12 <Beelsebob> I didn't... just wanted to start a chat :)
05:38:29 <aheller> well, that's good.
05:38:35 <Beelsebob> only way I can think to do it is to simulate a ND turing machine on a D one
05:38:40 <TFK> Well then, now I need two external libs: a cross-platform path library and a simple config parser.
05:38:41 <Beelsebob> but... hard
05:38:49 <TFK> Re path library, I'm getting this error:
05:38:59 <TFK> Could not find module `Distribution.Compat.FilePath':
05:39:00 <TFK>   it is hidden (in package Cabal-1.0)
05:39:24 <TheHunter> even if someone found a proof of P=NP, i doubt it would be a constructive one.
05:39:28 <TFK> Not sure what that means o_O
05:40:00 <Beelsebob> hmm, yes... because people have been trying it for a long time... it would have found a construction if it existed
05:40:52 <Beelsebob> nice to fanticise... it'd be a short route to getting a PhD and a Turing prize
05:41:27 <aheller> and ending the use of the internet for sensitive information...
05:41:42 <Beelsebob> well no... that's only if you do it constructively
05:42:30 <Beelsebob> and as well as that... even if there is a P algorithm for all NP problems, it could still be O(x^someHugeNumber)
05:42:44 <aheller> which, at some point will be tractable.
05:42:45 <TheHunter> not even then. We already have a polynomial algorithm to check primality and don't use it.
05:42:51 * TFK pokes Distribution.Compat.FilePath
05:43:13 <aheller> But yes, I am a little sky-is-falling about P=NP.  I just like the idea that there are canonically hard problems :)
05:43:48 <Beelsebob> heh
05:43:51 <Beelsebob> I don't
05:44:00 <Beelsebob> I'd quite like to be able to solve stuff
05:44:31 <Beelsebob> if you want to do encryption, make sure that to break it, the answer is exponential (beth deterministically, and non deterministically)
05:45:03 <aheller> I thought I might like to do cryptography once.  I got over that.
05:45:05 <aheller> :)
05:45:09 <Beelsebob> haha
05:45:17 * Muad_Dibber figures haskell is quite nice for cryptography, sint it?
05:45:36 <TFK> Is it?
05:46:34 <Muad_Dibber> i suppose cryptography has a lot to do with functions and such? :P
05:46:50 <TFK> So do Lychrel numbers >-)
05:47:18 <Beelsebob> not really... they have a lot to do with something very non-mathematical
05:47:41 <Beelsebob> it's not a common mathematical operation to reverse all the digits... nor one that makes much logical sense to do
05:48:10 <TFK> Whatever you say :-P
05:48:35 <earthy> cryptography actually wants more control than Haskell normally gives you
05:48:48 <earthy> if you want *good* cryptography, that is
05:49:27 <aheller> Haskell doesn't have bit-hockey goo?
05:50:26 <earthy> oh, yes it does
05:50:29 <earthy> that's not the issue
05:50:34 <aheller> hm?
05:50:37 <earthy> power usage, timing and stuff like that otoh...
05:50:46 <Itkovian> hehe no software patents in the EU!
05:50:46 <aheller> ah.  I see.
05:50:48 <Itkovian> woot!
05:50:52 <ski> :)
05:50:54 <earthy> oh, and wiping of keys from memory
05:51:11 <earthy> (yeah, GC is nice, but with cryptography you want to be damn sure that a key is not in memory anymore)
05:51:43 <poetix> Itkovian: for real?
05:51:46 <aheller> I hadn't been thinking quite so practically :)
05:51:49 <dcoutts> Itkovian, where did you see that?
05:51:53 <Itkovian> poetix: for now ...
05:52:06 <Beelsebob> poetix: yep
05:52:11 <Itkovian> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/06/eu_bins_swpat/
05:52:13 * Beelsebob went down 14 vs 684
05:52:15 <poetix> w000000000
05:52:27 <Beelsebob> and it will not be proposed again
05:52:28 <Itkovian> eat this suckers!
05:52:44 <tromp> or look at google news
05:52:47 <Itkovian> beelsebob: probably ... not for this term anyway I guess
05:52:52 <tromp> expand the business section
05:52:54 <Itkovian> haha!
05:53:02 <Beelsebob> and... London won the Olympics (woo yay)
05:53:19 <ski> http://wiki.ffii.org/SwpatcninoEn
05:53:25 <aheller> Beelsebob: as a new yorker, I share your joy.
05:53:32 <Itkovian> the only sad thing is that they prolly didn't vote against because it's bad, but because they wanted an unamended proposal ...
05:53:34 <Beelsebob> haha
05:53:46 <poetix> :(
05:53:47 <Itkovian> the olympics for when?
05:53:51 <Beelsebob> 2012
05:53:58 <Itkovian> hmm ...
05:54:07 <Itkovian> better make peace with the irsih by then ...
05:54:22 <Wed17010> as long as france didnt win im all with it
05:54:29 <Beelsebob> there's been peace with the irish for the past 5 years or so
05:54:33 <Beelsebob> 10 even
05:54:43 <df_> aheller :: as a `londoner', i don't.
05:54:55 <Beelsebob> df: lol
05:55:13 <Beelsebob> as a Canterburyan, I can avoid the stramash... but still go to them
05:55:34 <Itkovian> hehe
05:55:46 * Itkovian really doesn't care for the olympics
05:55:52 <Itkovian> it's overrated anyway
05:56:13 <aheller> df_: :)
05:56:19 <Itkovian> if people can't compete without drugs, then well, I don't give a shit anymore
05:56:29 <Beelsebob> I can't wait for the opening though... knowing britain, the stadium will still be being built :D
05:56:37 <Muad_Dibber> monads are some kind of drugs as well... :)
05:56:42 <Beelsebob> haha
05:58:41 <Itkovian> otoh the food will prolly suck ...
05:58:52 <Itkovian> chiraq hit the nail ...
05:58:54 <Itkovian> ;-)
05:59:48 <Beelsebob> heh... British food is good... as long as you go to the right place
06:00:00 * Beelsebob is very proud of how he cooks
06:00:36 <TFK> Beelsebob, no one was left alive long enough to complain? :-P
06:00:43 <Beelsebob> lol
06:00:53 <Beelsebob> hmm... I think I'm gonna go find some lunch
06:00:53 <poetix> The national dish is Chicken Tikka Masala
06:01:04 <Beelsebob> hehe, scarily... that's true
06:01:37 <Beelsebob> and for some reason it seems to be Chicken Tikka Masala with no Tikka in most places you go
06:01:46 <Itkovian> beelsebob: well, some people can prolly cook, but mostly the food is not edible
06:01:49 <dcoutts> yeah, we had not good food of our own so we've imported the rest of the world's food. The best curry in Europe is probably to be found in Birmingham.
06:02:03 <Itkovian> hehe
06:02:06 <Beelsebob> itkovian: that's pretty harsh
06:02:21 <Itkovian> then that was the reason to conquer the world, eh. bad food :-)
06:02:23 <Beelsebob> dcoutts: I don't know... Bradford or Glasgow would give it a run for it's money
06:02:30 <dcoutts> true
06:02:32 <poetix> Leicester is great for vegetarian curry - large Gujerati population
06:02:56 <Itkovian> all this food talk has me going hungry
06:03:01 * Itkovian fetches food.
06:03:02 <Beelsebob> I do love my curry... but I tend to do them myself
06:03:08 <Beelsebob> same here... I'm off to find some
06:03:09 <TFK> Is there a simple, cross-platform config-file parser?
06:03:29 <poetix> Is there an *edible* cross-platform config-file parsers?
06:03:41 <Beelsebob> tfk: yes if you use the plist file format
06:03:52 <TFK> plist file format?
06:04:02 <Beelsebob> Apple's xml config format
06:04:11 <TFK> Not XML o.o
06:04:19 <Beelsebob> why not... it's really good for configs
06:04:20 <aheller> why not scheme?
06:04:27 <aheller> guile builds on windows, I think.
06:04:36 <TFK> In other words, I should write my own?
06:04:37 <aheller> And it's less verbose than xml.
06:04:49 <poetix> TFK: why not, everyone else does?
06:04:58 <TFK> I don't want to duplicate effort.
06:05:00 <TFK> Thus my question.
06:05:10 <TFK> But if XML/Scheme are the only alternatives...
06:05:14 <Beelsebob> ... which is why apple created a standard format
06:05:40 <aheller> .ini format is pretty standard.
06:06:00 <TFK> Yes, but is there a parser for it?
06:06:03 <earthy> um, the british actually got that 'we ain't got no good food, let's rob it in other parts of the world' from the dutch, methinks
06:06:03 <Beelsebob> true... but plist is more efficient to read
06:06:16 <earthy> they just were slightly better at it. :)
06:06:21 * TFK points at ConfigParser of the Python stdlib for reference
06:06:27 <Beelsebob> example: launchd boots OS X in 4 seconds, initd in 40
06:06:47 <TFK> lunchd?
06:06:53 * TFK is hungry...
06:06:57 <aheller> Apple wrote a parser/format that boots Apple's software faster?  Huh...
06:07:05 <Beelsebob> Apple's replacement for initd and cron
06:07:09 <Beelsebob> that reads plists
06:07:25 <Beelsebob> there is also a binary representation for plist somewhere in the standard I think
06:07:31 <Itkovian> earthy: that may be true as well... but still I'd take a Dutch restaurant over an English one, any time
06:07:37 <aheller> ASN.1?
06:07:38 <Beelsebob> and apple plovide the source on the bsd licence
06:08:09 <Beelsebob> anyyway... FOOD god damn it
06:08:11 <TFK> Beelsebob, is a cross-platform Haskell library avaliable to manipulate that thing?
06:08:23 <Beelsebob> tfk: pass
06:08:27 <earthy> Itkovian: um, a good plum pudding is not bad
06:08:33 * TFK bangs head on wall
06:08:41 <TFK> So I'll write my own? No regrets?
06:08:47 <Itkovian> earthy: but it shakes like hell
06:14:07 <earthy> and I'm definitely partial to the traditional English breakfast as a way to start the day after a heavy night of partying
06:15:46 <Wed17010> being partial is being in favor of something?
06:15:58 <dcoutts> yes
06:16:12 <earthy> 'being partial to'
06:16:31 <earthy> and it's stronger than just being in favor of
06:16:38 <Wed17010> in that case.....im partial to fat stuff before/while and after drinking
06:16:40 <Wed17010> period
06:16:43 <Itkovian> earthy: oh no! give me a good belgian breakfast, skip the eggs, ham ...
06:16:51 <Itkovian> no hot food in the morning
06:16:58 <Itkovian> croissants otoh
06:17:08 <Itkovian> and a baguette
06:17:10 <Itkovian> mmm
06:17:22 <Wed17010> i recommend a KFC bucket before/while/after drinking
06:17:30 <earthy> warm croissants and baguette's, straight from the oven, with cream cheese and chives...
06:17:48 <earthy> or with trenches smoked salmon
06:18:02 * earthy 's mouth waters
06:18:16 <Wed17010> hot chickenwings for me
06:18:22 <earthy> as breakfast?
06:18:24 <earthy> nah
06:18:25 <Wed17010> sure
06:18:33 <Wed17010> i'd have them anytime
06:20:32 <earthy> there's few things I'd have anytime
06:21:38 <TFK> So Parsec is the only parser in the stdlib, I gather?
06:22:01 <earthy> it is
06:22:37 <earthy> oh, btw, Itkovian, did the belgian breakfast include beer? :P
06:23:51 <Itkovian> nope
06:24:08 <Itkovian> for some it does, but that goes for all nationalities I guess
06:30:36 <Beelsebob> mmm... beer
06:30:56 <Itkovian> man this IntMap bug seems wierd
06:31:00 <Itkovian> weird that is
06:49:34 <basti_> hi
06:49:51 <Beelsebob> lo
06:50:52 <basti_> europe stopped software patents
06:50:52 <basti_> :)
06:51:22 <basti_> with 648 of 680 votes against swpats
06:52:44 * basti_ bounces happily
06:52:56 <dcoutts> it's a pretty good result
06:54:40 <Itkovian> the result si good, the real reason is prolly not what we'd wanted
06:55:05 <basti_> what was the "real reason"?
06:57:00 <basti_> besides the parliament frowning upon the blatant behaviour of commission and council?
06:57:48 <arjanb> i fear they will just try again to get through slightly revised software patents next year
06:58:18 <basti_> well time for another no then
06:58:18 <basti_> =)
06:58:39 <df_> they /might/ run the process properly next time.
06:59:10 <basti_> it wasnt declined because of a formal error
06:59:53 <earthy> it was declined because the EC didn't listen to the EP at all
07:00:13 <basti_> yes.
07:03:14 <Itkovian> we'd like a no beause swpats suck and are bad, not because of some political feud
07:03:50 <Itkovian> hmm, if I load Data.IntMap in ghcio, can I only acces the exported functions? How do I gaina ccess to the internals?
07:03:59 <basti_> yes i'd like it that way too.
07:05:38 <Igloo> I think it needs to be interpreted if you want access to the internals
07:07:08 <Itkovian> hmm ... well, l;oading the raw .hs file won't work, ghci claims I should ignore-package base-1.0, which obviously fails utterly
07:07:15 <Itkovian> I'll retry with hugs
07:07:24 <Itkovian> provided I can get it to compile on my mac
07:08:13 <Igloo> You could rename it
07:09:53 <Itkovian> hmm, good point
07:10:00 <Itkovian> my brain is fogged it seems
07:10:05 <Itkovian> or clogged
07:10:09 <Itkovian> or just sleepy
07:10:56 <Igloo> I haven't looked at the impl, but I'd have thought Malcolm's test cases were small enough to just think through, though
07:11:12 <Igloo> Hmm, he didn't give his QC code, did he?
07:11:15 <Itkovian> loaded
07:11:39 <Itkovian> yes, well, I want to make sure I grok the meaning of the prefix and mask thingies in the Bin_s
07:12:15 <Itkovian> just want to compute them for myself and show the real data, not some beautyfied version
07:12:35 <Igloo> *nod*, if its complex internally then prodding it with ghci/hugs is probably easier
07:12:37 <Itkovian> by the time I grok all, somebody will have posted a fix I guess
07:21:07 <TFK> missingH!
07:21:45 <TFK> Its website seems to be down, however.
07:23:39 <axiom> hi
07:24:02 <TFK> quux.org seems to be down :-(
07:24:04 <axiom> what is wrong with this :         gethighest x:xs = foldr max x xs
07:24:10 <axiom> it gives me a "parse error in pattern"
07:25:04 <TheHunter> that is parsed as (gethightest x):xs = ...
07:25:13 <TheHunter> so you need to write gethighest (x:xs)
07:25:20 <axiom> oh
07:25:22 <axiom> thx
07:25:41 <TheHunter> application binds tightest, can't say it enough.
07:26:24 <Itkovian> You did say it yesterday I recall :-)
07:27:38 <Itkovian> imo something goes wrong when inserting stuff in the map
07:29:13 <musasabi> maybe comment the Show instance and add "deriving(Show)" - could help debugging.
07:30:16 <basti_> hmm anyone wanna discuss the possibility of rebuilding fast lazy lexers to a "prefix parsing thing"?
07:31:44 <Itkovian> musasabi: did that ... looking at the simple example posted now
07:32:08 <Itkovian> problem is, I'm busy with at least three other things at the same time
07:32:53 <Itkovian> e.g. browsing deviantart
07:32:56 <Itkovian> ;-)
07:34:57 <basti_> if we've got only one entry in the transition list in a lexer, we got a sure complete (tab will run as long as this is the case)
07:36:18 <basti_> but when can we notice that in a fast lazy lexer?
07:36:22 <tomdavie> damn... forgot to log out at home
07:36:23 <Itkovian> the problem with split 5 (insert 6 0 . insert 7 0 $ empty) is that the Tip 6 0 is immediately considered to be at the lower side of 5
07:36:44 <basti_> on "compile time" (when we build the expression) or only at "run time" (when input is coming)
07:36:47 <basti_> ?
07:37:37 <basti_> Itkovian: that doesnt look like a contradiction to me so far.
07:39:14 <Itkovian> basti_: eh? it seems to me that if you split at 5, you want 6 and 7 to be in the upper half, no?
07:39:27 <Itkovian> otherwise, I am totally off track
07:39:28 <basti_> Itkovian: "flip"?
07:39:45 <basti_> a contradiction would be if 6 and 7 would be in opposite halves
07:39:50 <Itkovian> basti_: well, they are
07:39:54 <tomdavie> interesting... I never knew that tibetans played the highland bagpipes
07:39:55 <basti_> okay thats bad.
07:39:57 <Itkovian> sorry, forgot to mention that
07:40:16 <Itkovian> it splits 7 off and then goes on making a union of 6 and Nil
07:40:25 <poetix> TFK: Hey, Spolsky fanboy -> http://brevity.org/misc/bestswi.html <- new Spolsky book
07:40:27 <basti_> hmmm
07:40:31 <basti_> thats bizarre.
07:40:41 * basti_ is into logics
07:40:44 <Itkovian> idd
07:41:15 <basti_> hmm
07:41:16 <TFK> I don't read Spolsky books.
07:41:27 <basti_> have you tried other numbers, or even vs. odd?
07:41:34 <basti_> (if that is possible)?
07:41:39 <TFK> But, good thing you pointed it out - Joel articles by proxy.
07:42:05 <basti_> anyone encountered the new roykspp album?
07:42:40 <Itkovian> basti_: I am looking at the examples posted by Malcolm Wallace on the libraries list, to which I have subscribed following shaprs erm nudge ...
07:43:36 <TFK> Ew, Graham.
07:43:38 <basti_> Itkovian: uhm.
07:43:51 <Itkovian> split 5 {6:=0,7:=0}	= ({6:=0},      {7:=0})
07:44:01 <Itkovian> split 4 {6:=0,7:=0}	= ({},          {6:=0,7:=0})
07:44:12 <Itkovian> split 8 {6:=0,7:=0} = ({6:=0},      {7:=0})
07:44:19 <Itkovian> so both 5 and 8 go wrong
07:44:27 <Itkovian> 4,6,7,9 are ok
07:45:28 <basti_> that looks like a off by one error?
07:45:35 <Itkovian> imo the mask is simply wrong
07:45:51 <Itkovian> (I am on PowerPC btw, if that matters anything (big endian afaik))
07:45:56 <basti_> hmmmm
07:46:07 <basti_> that could be a reason
07:46:15 <basti_> maybe.
07:46:22 <basti_> rather not imo, but thats just imo.
07:46:23 <Itkovian> a Map is a Bin Prefix Mask (Tree) (Tree)
07:46:54 <basti_> but, in numbers < 256 endianness doesnt change the order
07:46:59 <basti_> bitwise
07:47:02 <Itkovian> true
07:47:08 <Itkovian> so no problem there ...
07:47:09 <basti_> except its a very-wacko-endianness
07:47:10 <Itkovian> :-)
07:47:16 <basti_> but you could check that
07:47:24 <basti_> by tracking back what split does
07:47:31 <basti_> and applying the very same operation to various numbers
07:47:33 <Itkovian> yes, I could turn around and talk to my Athlon
07:47:39 <basti_> or that.
07:47:53 <basti_> but maybe something went wrong when the libs were compiled.
07:48:02 <basti_> because youre on a wacko platform
07:48:10 <Itkovian> well, I have the source, eh.
07:48:14 <basti_> :)
07:48:42 <Itkovian> I don't know what platform Malcolm is on, but I'm quite certain SPJ is using x86 ;-)
07:48:56 <Itkovian> I don't think Apples are allowed at MSR
07:48:59 <Itkovian> ;-)
07:49:11 <basti_> MSR?
07:49:19 <Itkovian> MickeySoft Research
07:49:30 <earthy> itkovian: do explain then why (and how) MS makes Office for Mac
07:49:34 <Itkovian> SPJ posted the bug
07:49:43 <Itkovian> earthy: erm ... no idea ;-)
07:49:44 <Itkovian> grin
07:49:45 <earthy> if apples are not allowed at MS
07:50:06 <Itkovian> thew smuggle the cd out to the local apple store and test it there
07:50:18 <earthy> ghe
07:50:34 <Itkovian> under the cover of dark
07:50:51 <basti_> ic -g-
07:51:20 <basti_> kudos go to SPJ for STM research btw.
07:51:39 <basti_> very great thing.
07:52:08 <basti_> dead simple and very clear and very obvious and THANK YOU.
07:56:12 <Itkovian> :-)
07:57:02 <Itkovian> anyway, I've got to go in a few mins. ttyl
08:45:51 <Beelsebob> bah... stupid passport forms
08:48:29 <Philippa> mmm. I'm really not looking forward to that one - as it is I'm probably going to let the current one expire in a few months
08:58:49 <df_> just make sure you renew before they take all your biometrics to sell to^W^W be stolen by the USA
08:59:42 <Beelsebob> yeh... half of why I'm doing it now is to dodge biometrics
08:59:53 <Beelsebob> ... along with probably going to IFL
09:01:00 <df_> i'm just making sure that i'll be able to emigrate to somewhere saner at some point
09:01:16 <basti_> df where would that be?
09:01:19 <basti_> utopia?
09:01:32 <basti_> the eurasic federation?
09:01:40 <df_> canada isn't too bad, nor are some of the nordic countries
09:01:41 <basti_> atlantis?
09:01:49 <basti_> but its so cold up there.
09:01:53 <df_> good
09:02:07 <tic> Sweden!
09:02:10 <df_> fewer buggers will do the same
09:02:10 <xs_> new zealand
09:02:17 <tic> You'll get to live (somewhat) close to John Hughes, as well.
09:02:22 <df_> yes, new zealand is quite good too
09:02:29 <basti_> nz is cool yes.
09:02:34 <basti_> my gf wants austrlia.
09:02:43 * df_ wouldn't go that far
09:02:56 <df_> and i prefer cooler climates too
09:04:20 <Beelsebob> hehe... a logician could make mince meat of these instructions
09:04:30 <Beelsebob> all people over 16 must fill in section 9
09:04:41 <Beelsebob> ... how am I meant to get *everyone* to fill it in????
09:05:32 <aheller> and what about people who are under 16?
09:06:31 <Beelsebob> nothing... they can fill it in if they like
09:06:50 <Beelsebob> I don't think there's room for that many people to fill in the form
09:07:14 <aheller> it doesn't say, though.  maybe they have to fill it in as well.
09:07:23 <Beelsebob> true
09:07:30 <Beelsebob> maybe they specifically don't
09:07:41 <basti_> maybe they may, when there's space
09:08:24 <Beelsebob> why has no one ever asked me to fill in section 9? Does that mean all passports issued after I was 16 are invalid?
09:09:50 <basti_> -g-
09:11:40 <Beelsebob> hehe... I like the way everyone on the demonstrations of photos that will not be accepted is muslim, or middle-eastern looking
09:12:24 <aheller> can't accuse them of false advertising.
09:12:32 <Oeje1> Beelsebob: Demonstrations of photos?
09:12:46 <df_> they all wearing towels?</daily mail>
09:13:07 <Beelsebob> all the women are wearing the black head-dress that I can't remember the name of
09:13:38 <Beelsebob> oeje: theres a load of photos showing how yours has to look
09:15:42 <lightstep> is there a ghc option to change the base dir for user modules? (i want ghc to look for Light.Step at /foo/Light/Step.hs)
09:16:02 <Oeje1> Beelsebob: Ah!  I'm not familiar with British media; who produces/consumes those photos?
09:16:08 <Lemmih> lightstep: -i/foo/
09:16:23 <Beelsebob> oeje: You do, for your passport
09:16:31 <lightstep> Lemmih, thanks
09:19:14 <Oeje1> Beelsebob: Hehe, I think, I get it now.
10:02:08 <SyntaxNinja> dons: hey, glad to see some cabal integration in hs-plugins. can you tell me abuot it?
10:06:51 <Speck> Has anyone here read Comprehending Queries by Torsten Grust?
10:13:30 <tessier_> So I was reading about tail recusion on wikipedia...Never really understood it before.
10:13:49 <tessier_> It looks like it is a special case of recusion which is basically iteration in that it does not push a full stack frame with each call to itself, right?
10:14:29 <basti_> i think so yes
10:14:35 <tessier_> And the end result is returned directly to the original caller.
10:15:07 <tessier_> So an infinite loop of tail recursion (on some sort of daemon or listener or something that should never exit anyway) would be acceptable.
10:15:23 <basti_> im not sure about that
10:15:43 <basti_> careful, do not confuse lazy evaluation and tail recursion!
10:16:19 <Igloo> JaffaCake: Are you here?
10:16:28 <basti_> a lazily evaluated algorithm might be tail recursive, but it could bei either or none too.
10:16:49 <Speck> Comprehending Queries: http://www.ub.uni-konstanz.de/kops/volltexte/1999/312/
10:17:00 <Igloo> Ah, n/m
10:18:42 <tessier_> basti_: I think I understand the difference between lazy evaluation and tail recusion.
10:20:06 <basti_> good.
10:20:41 <basti_> brb.
10:24:09 <lightstep> tessier_, what you described is the common idiom for iterative computations in scheme
10:27:13 <xs_> tail-recursion isn't desirable in a lazy language, right?
10:27:19 <Beelsebob> nope
10:27:29 <Beelsebob> it isn't desirable in most languagess
10:27:43 <lightstep> it isn't possible in graph-reduction languages
10:28:06 <lightstep> the graph is always reduces from the topmost redex
10:28:20 <lightstep> s/es/ed/
10:29:27 <lightstep> Beelsebob, are reified continuations or tail call optimization indesirable?
10:29:42 <Beelsebob> buh?
10:29:45 <Beelsebob> *g*
10:29:52 <Beelsebob> refs?
10:32:07 <lightstep> http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/callcc.html#sec_exn
10:33:10 <lightstep> the point is this: for define excetion handling with reified continuations, you need tail call optimization - at least then the callee is a continuation
10:35:22 * lightstep decides that his grammar mistakes never count
10:40:07 <SyntaxNinja> I have this problem w/ the System.Posix.IO module... I need to open a file, but to be safe, I need to create it first, I think.
10:40:23 <SyntaxNinja> so I use createFile, and then close it (since it apparently gives me a file handle that's only good for writing, not ReadWrite)
10:40:44 <SyntaxNinja> and then reopen it with ReadWrite, but on the reopen, I get a file busy error (because of laziness?)
10:41:13 <SyntaxNinja> I mgiht expect the OpenFileFlags to have create option, but they do not
10:41:28 <SyntaxNinja> or the createFile function to have an OpenMode param, but no.
10:48:39 <basti_> i have an idea about a new use of irc
10:49:39 <SyntaxNinja> basti_: this better be good; you're interrupting everyone's deep thinking about my question.
10:49:41 <SyntaxNinja> ;)
10:50:14 <basti_> im sorry to interrupt this meditation
10:50:38 <basti_> but, how about sort of a search engine/irc combo? a bot that would point you to a place where people with similar searches ended up
10:50:40 <Beelsebob> syntax: why would you want to read it... you wrote it
10:51:27 <basti_> or to several places (it /invites). Then you could talk with the people there
10:52:12 <basti_> it could also mark keywords that appear in conversations
10:53:09 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: life is complicated sometimes
10:53:10 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, any reason you can't use the System.IO functions? openFile/openBinaryFile allows you to create a new file and have it readable/writable
10:53:44 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah; they don't work on raw block files.
10:55:04 <dcoutts> so you're creating a new raw block file? (I don't know what they are)
10:56:28 <dcoutts> still, I'd guess that openFD will create the file if it doesn't exist
10:57:31 <dcoutts> I don't see why you'd need to create it, close it, then open it again. seems unsafe to me
10:59:20 <dcoutts> by raw block file do you mean something like /dev/hda1 ?
11:09:36 * Speck holds up a "bring back unified monad comprehensions" sign
11:09:52 <basti_> ?
11:10:36 <musasabi> that would be nice :-)
11:10:45 <Speck> http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mail-www/haskell/msg00172.html
11:11:05 <lightstep> @type Text.Html.hr
11:11:13 <lambdabot> Text.Html.Html
11:13:53 <basti_> *g*
11:24:14 <Beelsebob> I need a largo tub of ice creme or no writing will happen
11:37:30 <basti_> category theory is like elfen poetry on arugs
11:37:32 <basti_> drugs
11:44:05 <aheller> elfen poetry?
11:44:41 <musasabi> @pointless (\x -> return (x,True))
11:44:42 <lambdabot> return . flip (,) True
11:44:59 <basti_> you know... little winged beings... that sing strange songs
11:46:43 <aheller> Just trying to see how the ideas line up...
11:47:52 <basti_> i mean i bet youre pretty zonked after an elfen visit
11:48:03 <TFK> Elven, maybe?
11:48:07 <basti_> elven maybe yes
11:48:13 <aheller> or elfin...
11:48:23 <aheller> Either way, I'll take the zonked position.
11:48:31 <TFK> "Zonked" is an understatement :-/
11:48:44 <basti_> for ct or for elven?
11:49:01 <TFK> For me after being exposed to any of the above :-/
11:49:17 <basti_> i see
11:49:27 <aheller> I often question, upon reading a bit of MacLane, whether what I was just looking at something Real or the construction of a depraved author...
11:49:40 <TFK> Who's MacLane?
11:50:28 <Cale> http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/MacLane.html
11:50:29 <aheller> Algebraic Topologist cum co-inventor of Category Theory, I think.  Wrote "CT For the Working Mathemetician" which happened to be on sale while I was at the bookstore.
11:51:03 <TFK> aheller, are you a working mathematician? ;-)
11:51:13 <aheller> Well, I work...
11:51:32 * basti_ grins widely
11:51:41 <basti_> you know the feeling.
11:51:47 <TFK> hehe
11:52:00 <aheller> I'd be a mathematician if I were any good at math.
11:52:27 * basti_ is bad at everything
11:52:47 <aheller> this I cannot believe.
11:52:49 <basti_> except for hacking.
11:52:58 <aheller> I retract the statement, then :)
11:52:58 <basti_> did anyone have a look at yi-emacs?
11:53:06 * basti_ self-confidence boost
11:56:33 <astrolabe> Category theory FTWM seems to be out of print :(  When I was a student, I couldn't afford it.
11:56:56 <aheller> I got mine from Springer-Verlag... looking now...
11:57:33 <astrolabe> thanks
11:57:43 <Speck> FTWM = For The White Man?
11:58:01 <aheller> It comes with a pointy hat.
11:59:16 <TFK> aheller, what are you good at, if you don't mind me asking?
11:59:44 <aheller> Not much.  Understanding undergrad math, medium-picture software-ish things.
11:59:51 <astrolabe> Does anyone have the ISBN?
12:00:11 * Speck doesn't understand undergrad math
12:00:21 <aheller> I can't do it, I can just follow it.
12:00:37 <aheller> Hell, I still can't do integrals.
12:00:57 <astrolabe> aheller: Good for you!
12:01:11 <Speck> I think I might have done better in calc if I realized that derivatives were just higher order functions
12:01:20 <TFK> aheller, well, it was more heading the way of "what are you doing for a living" ;-)
12:01:29 <aheller> at the moment, ruby on rails.
12:01:32 <TFK> So you're a professional programmer?
12:01:38 <Speck> oh man; I used to be big on rails
12:01:40 <TFK> Is it fun? :-)
12:01:52 <aheller> as fun as web programming can be... or, no.
12:02:03 <aheller> but better than the java stuff I was doing before.
12:02:25 <Speck> I dunno, I might win for least-fun job... dba
12:02:54 <aheller> I could enjoy a very small slice of dba-ing for a while....
12:03:20 <Speck> not this db... ugh...
12:03:50 <aheller> :) tell me about it.  my webapps all have backends made Not By Me.
12:04:10 <astrolabe> Oooh Amazon US have it http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387984038/ref=pd_sr_ec_ir_b/102-4636492-5048929?v=glance&s=books&st=*
12:04:43 <aheller> Ah.  Me and my geocentrism.  Doesn't everyone live in New York? :)
12:05:17 <astrolabe> Probably just most people
12:06:00 <TFK> DBA = database applications?
12:06:13 * TFK doesn't live in New York
12:08:57 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah, something like /dev/hda1
12:09:12 <SyntaxNinja> and no, I don't create those, but I want my functionality to be pretty generic; if the file doesn't exist, then create it.
12:09:20 <SyntaxNinja> the reason I need to close it is that it's not open in the correct OpenMode
12:10:17 <Oeje1> aheller: New York is an ok city to pass through.
12:11:09 <aheller> Oeje1: I wouldn't want to live there forever; I was just laughing at myself for forgetting that amazon US might not be the first place someone would look for a book.
12:11:13 <Oeje1> Btw. I saw Marine One yesterday.
12:11:33 <aheller> You're in Scotland?  Or did Bush land today?
12:12:07 <Oeje1> He visited Copenhagen prior to going to Scotland.
12:12:15 * SyntaxNinja lunch &
12:13:15 <Oeje1> There were Black/Sea Hawks flying back and forth low over my flat.
12:14:46 <aheller> What a privilege</sarcasm>
12:17:24 <Oeje1> aheller: You're just jealous. :-P
12:17:35 <Oeje1> Hehe.
12:18:38 <aheller> Yeah.  A  day doesn't go by that I don't look wistfully out the window, hoping for a foreign dignitary to fly a fleet of military aircraft in a holding pattern over my house.  I've been trying to lose my hearing for years, but the subways and devil music just aren't working.
12:18:43 <aheller> :)
12:19:07 <oxyl> Hi, is there a wiki engine written in haskell? the haskell wiki itself is written in python
12:19:53 <TFK> There's Flippi.
12:19:58 <basti_> oh yes.
12:20:08 <TFK> Which is nearer to c2's wiki than MoinMoin, but hey...
12:22:22 <oxyl> thanx. I didn't know about that.  Which shouldn't be strange, given that it is version 0.03
12:23:48 <TFK> Indeed :-)
12:24:21 <oxyl> TFK: I prefer moinmoin to c2, but maybe I am not geek enough
12:24:34 <TFK> oxyl, me too, actually.
12:25:00 <TFK> And it's a pity that it took so long to even being writing a wiki.
12:25:09 <TFK> Gives off the wrong vibe, ya know?
12:25:44 <oxyl> yes WASH has been around for a while now
12:26:02 <TFK> All it needs is a decent CGI module :-P
12:26:08 <oxyl> (no idea if anybiody actually uses WASH though)
12:27:07 <TFK> Good question.
12:27:22 <astrolabe> Do any of the common Haskell monads come from pairs of adjoint functors?
12:27:53 <basti_> actually thats what i was asking myself too astrolabe
12:28:01 <basti_> just my thought was rather "uh?"
12:28:24 <astrolabe> basti_: great minds...
12:28:42 <basti_> np: Ryksopp - What Else Is There?
12:28:54 <basti_> ^ anyone heard the new ryksopp album?
12:30:02 <basti_> so back to these adjoint functors
12:30:36 <basti_> i dont have a clue what these are, actually.
12:30:46 <aheller> What're adjoints supposed to represent, again?
12:31:07 <basti_> another question.
12:31:17 <swiert> basti_: it's a good album
12:31:17 <basti_> i dimly remember something about some exchange property
12:31:26 <basti_> swiert: very very good yes.
12:32:12 <astrolabe> An example of a pair are the functor that takes a vector space to its underlying set and the functor that takes a set to the vector space of functions from that set into the reals
12:32:38 <basti_> aha.
12:33:23 <basti_> i dont get the second functor yet.
12:33:37 <basti_> the first is somewhat like a norm, typewise?
12:34:55 <astrolabe> They are adjoint because there is a natural 1-1 correspondance between maps from a set A into a vector space V, and linear maps from the vector space  (A -> R) into V.
12:35:32 <oxyl> Has anybody tried Flippi? I am looking at the source (can't run it here)
12:36:40 <TFK> oxyl, I believe that there is a working copy online.
12:37:10 <Cale> who runs sequence.complete.org?
12:37:30 <oxyl> basti_: important property of adjoints (one of many) is that if a functor has left adjoint then it is continuous (menaning it preserves categorical limits)
12:37:40 <astrolabe> basti_: if the set: A has two elements, then the image of A under the second functor is the set of pairs of reals
12:38:24 <astrolabe> or rather, the vector space of pairs of reals
12:39:21 <swiert> basti_: do you know what hom sets are?
12:40:13 <oxyl> TFK: I wonder the source code is so small because it is written in haskell (superior language) or is it because of eth lack of features
12:40:31 <oxyl> TFK: Yes I followed the link.
12:40:47 <Speck> Cale, John Goerzen, and now that I look it's hacked (which I'm sure you already know)
12:40:50 <oxyl> TFK: it is on http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/flippi/flippi
12:41:02 <basti_> hmmm i do not know what hom sets are
12:41:05 <TFK> oxyl, lack of features.
12:41:11 <TFK> Terseness is not a measure of superiority.
12:41:15 <TFK> Unless you're an APL freak...
12:41:16 <Speck> I recently read about hom sets... now to remember what they are.
12:41:17 <basti_> astrolabe: i kinda get what you are saying
12:41:58 <swiert> hom(a,b) is the set of morphisms from a to b
12:42:07 <basti_> oh
12:42:21 <oxyl> TFK: well, a terse program might get you The Judges Prize
12:43:07 <TFK> oxyl, not in the competition of life.
12:43:25 <TFK> At least, I'm yet to see a J startup :-/
12:44:33 <swiert> an adjunction is a iso between hom(f a, b) ~ hom(a, u b) where f and u are the adjoint functors
12:45:10 <basti_> oh okay.
12:45:17 <basti_> i think thats understandable
12:45:33 <swiert> that's the shortest definition I know.
12:45:40 <basti_> are IO and OI adjoint?
12:45:53 <astrolabe> :)
12:46:00 <oxyl> swiert: but that holds in small categories only, doesn't it?
12:46:07 <basti_> :-o
12:46:39 <swiert> oxyl: i'm not sure...
12:46:40 <basti_> whats a non small category?
12:46:43 * Speck really wants to learn this category theory stuff
12:46:47 <basti_> >w_0?
12:46:48 <oxyl> not that anybody here cares about category of categories
12:46:58 <basti_> and, are IO and OI adjoint?
12:47:08 <astrolabe> For the right definition of 'iso' that is how adjoint functors are defined.
12:47:24 <basti_> hmm yes of course youd need to supply the iso
12:47:31 <oxyl> basti_ CAT: where objects are categories and morphisms are functors between them
12:47:33 <astrolabe> What is OI?
12:47:41 <basti_> oxyl: i heard about that yes.
12:47:51 <basti_> astrolabe: the mirror image of IO
12:48:24 <basti_> http://haskell.org/hawiki/CoMonad
12:48:37 <musasabi> Has anyone used the Eclipse haskell stuff? Is it good as compared to emacs?
12:48:47 <astrolabe> basti_:ta
12:48:52 <basti_> so next question, what would i NEED that for?
12:49:26 <TFK> Speck, you do? o.o;
12:49:38 <Speck> don't anger the categorists further, basti_, haskell is already an affront to their holy inpenetrable tower of generalized abstract nonsense
12:49:48 <basti_> Speck: lol
12:50:13 <basti_> no but honestly
12:50:14 <Speck> TFK, it sounds like something I'd enjoy, I have a kind of a fetish for categorizing things
12:50:24 <basti_> maybe the OI notation does some good in some place
12:50:30 <basti_> maybe seperating input from output?
12:50:36 <aheller> one of my math profs on CT: "You think your space is big?  It's only a *point* in *my* space!"
12:50:47 <edwinb> I've always wanted to learn this category theory stuff, right up to the point when I actually start, then I decide I didn't want to know after all...
12:51:21 <TFK> Speck, I... see.
12:51:21 <astrolabe> It does help to know you've got exams on it at the end of the year.
12:51:23 <Speck> I'm reading a paper right now that is pretty heavy on CT (at least for me), but a lot of it is finally clicking, so I think I'm getting somewhere
12:51:47 <Speck> One problem is that I'm _horrible_ at proofs.
12:52:01 <basti_> you got to practice
12:52:11 <Speck> yeah I know, that's why I keep at it :-)
12:52:29 <basti_> i never forgot how to prove things after geometry in the 7th grade.
12:53:16 <Speck> yeah... I definitely forgot, though I was pretty good at it then
12:53:41 <Speck> I wish my math teacher had explained the connection between induction and recursion though
12:53:42 <basti_> my gf can do any statistic calculation.
12:53:46 <basti_> except for things with dice
12:54:20 <aheller> people use statistics for things other than D&D?
12:54:29 * Speck gasps
12:55:03 <basti_> *g*
12:56:12 <Speck> man, the problem with these ct papers is that they make a new category for everything, and we're back where we started
12:56:36 <basti_> :)
12:56:59 <basti_> or at catamorphisms.
12:57:22 <basti_> btw, what are (cata|ana|hylo)morphisms in the CT view of the world?
12:57:30 <basti_> some limits?
12:57:45 <Speck> I know cata is from greek meaning down or descent
12:57:59 <basti_> hmm well
12:58:03 <Speck> and it's related to folds in some way
12:58:06 <basti_> for lists those things are very intuitive
12:58:09 <swiert> basti_: there's some really nice work on that
12:58:09 <basti_> yes
12:58:42 <basti_> an ana is a -> [a], a cata is [a]->a a hylo is (a->[a],[a]->a)
12:58:53 <basti_> length(X,5) in prolog is an ana
12:58:55 <basti_> length is a cata
12:59:01 <basti_> and faculty can be expressed as a hylo
12:59:05 <swiert> look up papers about lenses and bananas
12:59:12 <basti_> swiert: ive seen this one yes
12:59:26 <basti_> actually its on my disk, and everytime i try it i understand a little more
12:59:54 <basti_> the faculty hylo would be somewhat like  \n->fold (*) [1..n]
13:00:06 <Speck> link? I could use a paper on anything
13:00:07 <basti_> (build a list and destroy it again)
13:00:18 <basti_> Speck: just search for swierts papers
13:00:30 <basti_> there are not too many bearing a name with lenses, bananas and barbed wire
13:00:40 <Speck> barbed wire, eh
13:00:48 <basti_> < + |
13:00:49 <Speck> that's an accurate description of anything CT
13:00:50 <basti_> overlayed
13:01:05 <Speck> "you can look, but don't touch"
13:01:06 <basti_> a bar and a pointed brace overstruck
13:01:15 <oxyl> Maybe you should have a look at charity (a categorical programming language). But I should go...
13:01:19 <basti_> thats the braces they use for hylomorphisms
13:03:08 <Speck> oh, I know what bananas are
13:03:12 <Speck> (| |)
13:03:25 <basti_> yes
13:03:38 <basti_> and lenses are )] [( i think
13:03:50 <basti_> or [(  )]
13:04:03 <basti_> just a notation for these things
13:04:08 <Speck> http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/meijer91functional.html  ?
13:04:10 <basti_> i didnt understand the ct implications fully, though
13:04:29 <basti_> yes, definitely
13:04:32 <musasabi> Charity seems quite dead.
13:05:16 <Speck> if you're looking for a good read, I'm really having fun reading this: http://www.ub.uni-konstanz.de/kops/volltexte/1999/312/
13:05:58 <Speck> I hope it culminates to a haskell implementation of a generic query language, which is what it appears to be doing thus far
13:05:58 <basti_> Speck: i already d/ld this when you mentioned it first
13:06:10 <Speck> oh haha yeah that's the second time I spammed it :-P
13:06:26 <basti_> could be pretty interesting
13:07:09 <Speck> it would fill a need for me that I was looking to solve with scrap your boilerplate
13:07:18 <Speck> in a much nicer way
13:07:53 <basti_> hmm :)
13:08:08 <swiert> Speck: ever heard of generic haskell?
13:08:19 <Speck> yeah I started reading the paper and was distracted
13:09:03 <Speck> I was going to use generic haskell to parse a well-typed data structure from web server logs, but that's for when I have more time to play around
13:09:17 <swiert> basti_: oddly enough reading the intro to http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/publ/cmcs01.pdf made things clearer for me than the bananas paper.
13:09:57 <swiert> why does the parser need to be generic?
13:10:15 <Speck> the types are defined in the log file
13:11:27 <Speck> what is a least fixpoint type?
13:12:55 <basti_> swiert: ooof.
13:12:59 <swiert> think recursive haskell datatype
13:13:04 <edwinb> I think that's just an inductive type
13:13:25 <edwinb> Presumably with strictly smaller recursive values
13:13:36 <Speck> what does "fixpoint" signify?
13:14:48 <edwinb> just that it's recursive, I guess
13:14:55 * edwinb pretends to know what he's talking about
13:15:17 <astrolabe> I think it means fixed under some transformation
13:15:23 <astrolabe> think == guess
13:15:34 <aheller> so not as in the DS sense?
13:15:51 <astrolabe> DS?
13:16:05 <aheller> Denotational (Scott-Strachey?) Semantics
13:16:25 <aheller> Keep meaning to read more about that.
13:16:47 <Speck> from a paper I just found "a fixpoint of a [recursive function definition] is a partial function that satisfies the equation"
13:16:54 <astrolabe> If somebody knows what they are talking about, I'm not going to take part in this conversation ;)
13:16:55 <Speck> not that that clears anything up for me
13:17:03 <xs_> isn't a fixed point, say, x of f, x = f x? is this different to fixpoint?
13:17:11 <edwinb> In the context of this paper, I don't think it particularly matters ;)
13:17:38 <Speck> well it's a term I've seen around a few times and glossed over, so I figured maybe it was worth knowing
13:17:41 <edwinb> Just that fold consumes, and unfold produces...
13:18:04 <basti_> http://haskell.org/hawiki/CoMonad < is that source code supposed to work?
13:18:12 * Speck wonders what english would be like in point-free form
13:18:29 <aheller> As I understand it, it's what xs_ said.  x is a fixed point of the function f if (f x) = x (f x)
13:19:15 <astrolabe> Is that what xs said?
13:19:26 <Speck> I see, then the least fixpoint would be x in that definition and the greatest fixpoint would be x,x,...
13:19:29 <aheller> I thought...
13:20:27 <aheller> Speck: but does fixpoint mean the same thing when talking about types as functions?  This I wonder.
13:20:52 <astrolabe> aheller: what are the types of x and f in your defn?
13:21:03 <swiert> look at the F A = Nil | Cons Int A
13:21:26 <Itkovian> hi
13:21:27 <swiert> taking the fixed point gives you the List data type
13:21:43 <Speck> hey Itkovian
13:21:51 <Itkovian> hi Speck
13:21:57 <aheller> astrolabe: hadn't thought about it...  all the DS stuff I read was for the Untyped LC, and I hadn't really thought about it much for a while.
13:22:14 <Itkovian> Told you somebody would fix the bug before I got round to examining it ...
13:22:52 <aheller> swiert: aha!
13:23:00 <Speck> fixpoint, wrt types, is used interchangably with recursive it seems
13:23:05 <swiert> talking about least fixed points is a way to theoretically capture the notion of recursive datastructures (in this particular context)
13:29:12 <Speck> man... did anyone here play with monad comprehensions in haskell 1.4?
13:29:38 <wilx> Haskell 1.4?
13:29:44 <wilx> Isn't that like...old?
13:29:47 <Speck> that's what this paper says
13:30:13 <Speck> apparently list comprehensions were generalized to monad comprehensions, but they reverted it because newbies got confusing error messages
13:30:48 <astrolabe> That's a shame, monad comprrehensions sound cool
13:31:15 <Speck> the paper I linked to above talks about it
13:31:46 <Speck> formalizes it, really
13:33:53 <astrolabe> Speck: Do you mean the bannanas one?
13:34:12 <reffie> this shit is bananas
13:34:15 <reffie> B A N A N A S
13:34:36 <Speck> no, the one I linked to
13:34:48 <Speck> err, without a question mark
13:35:40 <Speck> this  http://www.ub.uni-konstanz.de/kops/volltexte/1999/312/
13:35:48 <Speck> (which makes the third time I've spammed it)
13:35:59 <astrolabe> Ah got it thanks.  Fortunately there is an english bit :)
13:36:07 <Speck> the paper is in english
13:36:49 <basti_> what uses could a list comonad have?
13:37:04 <Speck> there is a list monad...
13:37:12 <basti_> Im just thinking aloud
13:37:13 <basti_> :)
13:37:35 <Speck> ambiguous parsing, according to "all about monads"
13:37:48 <basti_> :-o
13:38:15 <basti_> i think that a list monad would be some sort of "choice"
13:38:26 <basti_> since you have to feed in [a]->b functions
13:38:55 <basti_> you reduce the list to one value, and then calculate on with that in a singleton list dont you?
13:39:56 <astrolabe> There is something about this in the Suduko article in the latest TMR
13:41:00 <basti_> suduku?
13:41:34 <xs_> sudoku
13:41:37 <astrolabe> http://www.haskell.org/tmrwiki/SolvingSudoku
13:42:22 * Igloo is trying to convince someone to write a program to count how many unique su doku there are
13:43:01 <astrolabe> Igloo: do you mean how many full grids?
13:43:12 <Igloo> yup
13:43:49 <basti_> cool article
13:43:55 <swiert> modulo things like alpha conversion and symmetry?
13:43:56 <Igloo> I think it ought to be a tractable problem if you normalise the top row to be 1..9, or the top left square to be in order, or somesuch
13:44:26 <xs_> didn't someone already do that, with haskell?
13:44:32 <Igloo> Well, you can probably compute with or without those once you have one answer easily enough
13:44:55 <Igloo> xs_: If they did they didn't tell me  :-)
13:45:15 <astrolabe> How many orbits under S9 x S3^8?
13:45:42 <xs_> Igloo: http://www.shef.ac.uk/~pm1afj/sudoku/
13:46:06 <Igloo> cool, ta
13:47:09 <xs_> ahh.. they just pruned some configurations using it, oops
13:53:23 <astrolabe> Hmm, so it seems there are 71 essentially different full grids?
13:54:19 <Speck> leaving work, later all
13:54:41 <astrolabe> Oh no, maybe just 44.
13:55:01 <basti_> hmm
13:55:06 <basti_> comonads do make some sense.
13:55:15 <basti_> i think.
13:56:05 * astrolabe is still confused enough by monads
13:56:31 <TFK> monads!
13:57:46 <Philippa> comonads mostly confuse me because all the flow feels backwards (unsurprisingly) and I've not seen enough good examples of problems where that's the appropriate thing to have a good intuition
13:58:26 <basti_> yes.
13:58:27 <astrolabe> monads is one typo from gonads
13:58:54 <basti_> i still have that log of #touch-my-gonads
13:58:58 <basti_> uhm
13:58:59 <basti_> monads
13:58:59 <Beelsebob> indeed... and you wouldn't put anything in gonads
13:59:31 <basti_> hmm
13:59:43 * Philippa wonders if this is a good time to mention the bind operation
13:59:48 <xs_> bind-my-monads was better.
13:59:52 <xs_> heh.
14:02:14 <TFK> here's a monad, there's a monad, and another little monad, fuzzy monad, funny monad, monad monad duck!
14:02:24 <TFK> Idea stolen from http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/llama.php
14:02:25 * boegel parties
14:02:25 <basti_> the Maybe comonad would force you to compute a value.
14:02:38 <basti_> and to cope with nothing.
14:02:39 <TFK> Maybe True.
14:02:44 <Beelsebob> now then listen little child
14:02:46 <basti_> it would force you to deliver a value.
14:02:48 <boegel> I just graduated ! *yaay
14:02:49 <Beelsebob> to the safety rail
14:02:52 <aheller> Philippa: which reminds me, I dug your article.
14:02:55 <TFK> :-D
14:02:57 <basti_> boegel: congrats! :)))
14:03:00 <aheller> boegel: congrats/condolences!
14:03:04 <boegel> basti_: thanks
14:03:12 <Beelsebob> go boegel: what in?
14:03:13 <Beelsebob> *g*
14:03:14 <boegel> aheller: condolences ? why on earth ? :)
14:03:16 * Beelsebob duckss
14:03:17 <TFK> boegel, woo! Graduated what? o.o
14:03:19 <boegel> Beelsebob: cs ;)
14:03:50 <TFK> graduated with what? B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D.?
14:04:00 <Beelsebob> GNVQ?
14:04:12 <boegel> Master (well, the equivalent of it, we still have the old system over here)
14:04:13 <aheller> boegel: because for some (me for instance), school was fantastic, and the real world is nothing but pain :)
14:04:17 * TFK shoves a GNVQ down Beelsebob's throat
14:04:23 <Beelsebob> :D
14:04:36 <TFK> boegel, woo! A true scholar amongst our ranks ;-)
14:04:48 * Philippa showers boegel in dancing rodents
14:05:18 <boegel> Philippa: rodents ? :) wtf
14:05:27 <Philippa> boegel: conga rats
14:05:53 <boegel> Philippa: oh, didn't see that one coming at all :)
14:05:59 <boegel> thanks :)
14:07:40 * boegel has no idea what GNVQ means, even after using Google
14:08:39 <Beelsebob> it's a crappy college certificate
14:08:40 <TFK> General Nonsense Voiced Quizically (?!)
14:08:51 <Beelsebob> that about sums it up
14:08:56 <Philippa> boegel: General National Vocational Qualification, IIRC
14:09:33 <Beelsebob> it's what you do if you drop out of school and then go *shit, should have actually learned something*
14:09:35 <boegel> oh, I see
14:09:46 <boegel> Beelsebob: hehe :)
14:09:50 <Philippa> or if you're looking to do something more pragmatic
14:10:05 <Philippa> IIRC they're the relevant qualifications for plumbers and electricians these days, for example
14:10:06 <Beelsebob> true
14:10:14 <Philippa> and plumbers make silly money right now
14:10:26 <Beelsebob> yeh... plumbers do a very skilled job though
14:10:30 <Beelsebob> so they deserve to
14:10:51 <Philippa> no more so than everybody else who does, mind
14:11:00 <TFK> As opposed to coding slackers.
14:11:02 <Philippa> only there's a bit of a shortage atm
14:11:09 <TFK> Who only chat on IRC :-/
14:11:20 <SyntaxNinja> is 'make html' meant to give me the haddock files in fptools/libraries? it always gives me an error
14:11:38 <Beelsebob> TFK: No... that's PhD students who are... `looking for inspiration'
14:11:57 <Beelsebob> syntaxNinja: I'd be willing to bet that that's because Haddock is crap
14:11:58 <TFK> hehe
14:13:15 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: I think you'd lose that bet
14:13:16 <Philippa> Beelsebob: give or take. I might finish my BSc one of these years
14:13:39 <Beelsebob> SyntaxNinja... maybe, but Haddock is still crap :)
14:15:25 <SyntaxNinja> I disagree.
14:15:43 <SyntaxNinja> now if you said 'make' is crap, or cpp is crap,then i'd be with you ;)
14:15:46 <Beelsebob> well... the most informative error it ever gives you is: "Parse Error: []"
14:16:06 <Beelsebob> and it breaks on a lot of things that the docs say are correct input
14:16:19 <Beelsebob> and it's inflexible in the output it gives
14:16:28 <Beelsebob> which IMHO adds up to... crap
14:17:26 <Philippa> it's not overly good for 'internal' documentation as opposed to end-user docs for libraries
14:17:34 <Beelsebob> indeed
14:17:52 <Beelsebob> does this make sense to anyone: a 58-year-old woman who died after being attacked in a row over a parking space yesterday condemned a judge's "disgraceful" decision to let her killer walk free.
14:18:13 <SyntaxNinja> heh
14:18:21 <Beelsebob> who let the zombies out?
14:18:43 <aheller> zombies make a lot more sense than my interpretation...
14:18:44 <Philippa> medically dead, revived
14:19:20 <Beelsebob> no... she's been sentenced to 3 years probation for assault and man-slaughter
14:19:47 <Beelsebob> sorry no... culpable homicide
14:20:02 <aheller> the woman, or her killer?
14:20:46 <Beelsebob> the killer
14:21:14 <Beelsebob> it turns out that it's the husband who's appauled... but that sentence makes little-to-no-sense
14:21:30 <Philippa> "The husband of..."?
14:21:37 <Beelsebob> the murdered woman
14:21:55 <Philippa> sorry, let me rephrase: the sentance should've begun "The..."?
14:22:10 <Beelsebob> the husband of the murdered woman
14:22:14 <Philippa> 'cos I can parse the rest fine
14:26:48 <boegel> has shapr released a new TMR yet ?
14:27:19 <Philippa> IssueFour is out, yeah
14:28:16 <boegel> oh, lemme check
14:28:23 --- topic: set to '["logs: http://meme.b9.com/cview.html?channel=haskell&date=today","http://www.haskell.org/learning.html","http://www.haskell.org/ghc/survey/start.cgi","http://www.haskell.org/tmrwiki/IssueFour,"ICFP Contest! http://icfpc.plt-scheme.org/"]' by boegel
14:28:25 <dcoutts> boegel, I've got a patch to HRay to make it not lock the GUI when rendering, but I can't talk about it now, I've got to go burn things :-)
14:28:35 <boegel> burn ? :)
14:28:42 <dcoutts> bye
14:28:51 <boegel> dcoutts: cool, but I'm afraid I don't have the time to check it out
14:28:52 <Beelsebob> ohhhh... sounds fun
14:28:55 <Beelsebob> clubs?
14:28:57 <dcoutts> s'ok, it's only wood
14:29:05 <dcoutts> see you later
14:29:08 <Beelsebob> boring
14:29:12 <boegel> you can mail is to me, but I'll only have time in August, I'm leaving on holiday soon
14:29:13 <Beelsebob> it's more fun if it's you
14:29:16 <boegel> dcoutts: bye
14:30:14 * boegel leaves for a good night's rest
14:30:26 <aheller> congrats.
14:31:11 <boegel> if anyone needs me (HRay, HaskLS, anything else), just email me, you can find my address through my wiki page
14:31:23 <boegel> I won't be able to reply until August, but hey :p
14:31:28 <boegel> bye everyone !

15:29:03 <MachinShin> hey all
15:29:37 <SyntaxNinja> hi
16:25:15 <autrijus> :(
16:25:47 <autrijus> <- paper rejected, not going to estonia after all
16:25:56 <Igloo> :-(
16:26:02 <Igloo> Was that on pugs?
16:26:05 <autrijus> yeah.
16:27:10 <autrijus> scored "B-" by reviewers ranking themselves as "Z"
16:27:12 <autrijus>  Z: I am not an expert. My evaluation is that of an informed outsider.
16:28:07 <Igloo> B- on what, A-C?
16:28:16 <autrijus> A-D
16:28:17 <autrijus>  B: Ok paper, but I will not champion it.
16:28:30 <wilx> What paper?
16:28:34 <autrijus> wilx: the pugs paper
16:28:51 <wilx> Oh.
16:29:10 <Igloo> Hmm, I guess things like pugs lie somewhere between ICFP/HW and CUFP
16:29:34 <Igloo> Not really theoretical, but at the same time not actually commercial
16:29:38 <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: my cabal paper got rejected, rated A, A, B
16:29:44 <Igloo> (unless your paper is theoretical, I haven't seen it
16:29:46 <Igloo> )
16:29:59 <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: nice, B,B,C here :)
16:30:13 <SyntaxNinja> I guess you needed a 4.0 or something ;)
16:30:23 <autrijus> oy vey.
16:31:10 <SyntaxNinja> heh, I made that up, I have no idea.
16:43:05 <tomdavie> evening all
16:45:46 <TFK> quux.org is still down ;_;
16:45:59 <tomdavie> what would it be normally?
16:46:11 <TFK> It would normally host missingH.
16:46:27 <TFK> Which I need because it apparently has a config file parser.
16:46:53 <tomdavie> I see
16:47:08 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: use debian?
16:49:01 <TFK> I really want to quote Linus Torvalds now, but I won't, instead maybe someone here has the tarball and will be generous enough to send it to me? ^_^
16:49:07 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: I think if you click on the tarball here, that's the original upstream tarball: http://packages.debian.org/stable/source/missingh
16:49:21 <SyntaxNinja> http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/missingh/missingh_0.10.7.sarge.2.tar.gz
16:49:44 <SyntaxNinja> not sure what your linux quote would be?
16:50:11 <TFK> Is it Debian-specific or is the code generic?
16:50:32 <TFK> It's better that I won't, because I may have misunderstood your intention so it can get pretty ugly :-/
16:50:38 <SyntaxNinja> well, normally, I'd say it's generic if it ended in orig.tar.gz, I'm not sure what that "sarge.2" means, but it SHOULD be generic.
16:50:41 <TFK> I'll just shut up and download that tarball, thanks :-)
16:50:57 <SyntaxNinja> I was goign to suggest that if you use debian, you can install it without access to the web site, via apt-get ;)
16:51:42 <TFK> I have Ubuntu, but I can't reboot atm from Windows.
16:52:37 <tomdavie> ugh
16:52:49 <tomdavie> now there's a situation I never want to find myself in
16:52:49 <Igloo> I imagine that's a generic tarball including a debian/ directory, but I'm not sure why he's made it a Debian native package
16:53:31 * TFK studies ConfigParser code
16:53:57 * TFK hopes it is standalone o_O
16:55:28 <TFK> Well, it says that it is implemented in pure Haskell, so it must be portable :-)
16:56:31 <TFK> "Complete compatibility with Python's ConfigParser module" wow, this totally rocks!
16:58:33 <TFK> So now I only have to deal with Distribution.Compat.FilePath. I'm trying to import it but it says that it is "hidden" by Cabal. What does that mean? That I don't have Cabal?
16:58:59 <tomdavie> heh... yeh... I never did figure that out either
16:59:00 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: it means that cabal lists it as a hidden module.  it may be that the latest cvs version of cabal has exposed it
16:59:22 <tomdavie> but... why when cabal is not on the system
16:59:32 <Lemmih> TFK: I got a FilePath package containing just that file.
16:59:39 <SyntaxNinja> it is not meant to be used on the outside? why? read the thread on FilePath on the libraries mailing list. I disagree with the conclusions ther. it was supposedc to be System.FilePath or something.
17:00:01 <SyntaxNinja> tomdavie: if you get that error, i suspect that cabal is on the system ;)
17:00:29 <tomdavie> yeh... but I've had it from systems that I've just done a clean install of gentoo and emerged ghc
17:00:49 <tomdavie> you *do* get that error on systems with cabal not installed
17:00:52 <SyntaxNinja> some people didn't like the interface of FilePath, so it was not included. I wish it had been, personally.
17:00:59 <Igloo> Recent ghc includes cabal
17:01:03 <tomdavie> ah... okay
17:01:06 <tomdavie> fair enough
17:02:35 <SyntaxNinja> tomdavie: 'ghc' is the operative word there ;)
17:02:35 <SyntaxNinja> tomdavie: cabal comes with ghc. you can see that if you run "ghc-pkg -l"
17:02:56 <tomdavie> yeh... I'd now gathered that
17:03:07 <TFK> Well, I have Cabal...
17:03:10 <tomdavie> odd... Simon Thompson has since asked me to install cabal on that system
17:03:14 <TFK> 1.0, even.
17:04:05 <SyntaxNinja> tomdavie: he might not realize that it comes w/ ghc 6.4 and recent hugs and nhc versions
17:04:15 <TFK> Bah, how do I search for stuff in these archives o_O
17:04:20 <tomdavie> fair enough
17:05:18 <TFK> FilePath seems very similar to Python's os.path :-/
17:07:45 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: there's a reason for that :)
17:08:14 <TFK> I gathered already that many Haskell programs mutate to Python programmers at working hours ;-)
17:08:36 <TFK> Nothing interesting on ghc-cvs. Anyhow, I need some kind of cross-platform path-handling thingie. Is there no way to use Distribution.Compat?
17:09:13 * Lemmih still got a FilePath package for people wanting to use Distribution.Compat.FilePath
17:09:13 <SyntaxNinja> use Lemmih's package. link Lemmih?
17:09:28 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: can one install cabal-get easily yet?
17:09:35 <TFK> Oh, sorry, missed it. Lemmih, please link me :-)
17:10:03 <Lemmih> http://scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/packages/FilePath-0.1.0.tgz
17:10:12 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: be warned, the purity police might get you
17:10:14 <SyntaxNinja> ;)
17:10:29 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: Kinda.
17:10:44 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: double-clicking is too hard, I want to just single click.
17:10:59 <TFK> Why, what did I do wrong? :O
17:11:03 <TFK> I'm innocent! :O
17:11:11 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: Need a script to untar, build and install.
17:12:12 <Lemmih> Shouldn't take that long to hack.
17:12:24 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: :)
17:12:33 <Lemmih> Are we ready to release Cabal/Hackage?
17:12:53 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: I sent out a heads-up to the libraries list about a new cabal. we'll see if anyone objects.
17:15:03 <SyntaxNinja> here's the thread on System.FilePath: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2004-October/002591.html
17:16:04 <SyntaxNinja> an example of objections: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2004-October/002615.html
17:16:27 * Lemmih would click on that if he had a mouse /-:
17:20:54 <wagle> Lemmih: you your air mouse
17:21:02 <wagle> Lemmih: use your air mouse
17:23:33 <TFK> Hmmm, I lived just fine with os.path...
17:24:04 <TFK> It seems to do the right thing.
17:25:04 <Lemmih> So it works in practice but not in theory?
17:26:01 <TFK> I don't quite know the theory. But I didn't stress-test it, either.
17:26:44 <TFK> >>> os.path.splitext("/")
17:26:44 <TFK> ('/', '')
17:26:44 <TFK> >>> os.path.splitext(".")
17:26:44 <TFK> ('', '.')
17:27:05 <TFK> splitext seems well-defined for me.
17:27:37 <TFK> Or mabye splitFileName isn't splitext o_O
17:27:44 * TFK backtracs
17:29:29 <TFK> >>> os.path.split("/"); os.path.split(".")
17:29:31 <TFK> ('/', '')
17:29:31 <TFK> ('', '.')
17:30:03 <dons> moin
17:31:40 <TFK> Eeek, IO Monad.
17:32:07 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: yeah, I think FilePath works in practice, but not in theory.
17:33:18 <TFK> split(p): "Return tuple (head, tail) where tail is everything after the final slash. Either part may be empty."
17:33:39 <SyntaxNinja> hi dons
17:33:44 <TFK> I'm not sure what theory is required here. It seems that they were debating the "intuitiveness" of the library.
17:33:47 <SyntaxNinja> dons: can you tell me about plugsin' use of cabal?
17:33:54 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: What does a rating of A, A, B mean?
17:35:50 <dons> SyntaxNinja, at the moment, this means being able to read and track dependencies for cabal-style package.confs
17:35:59 <TFK> Some things are better done than thought about. Even if it makes Python a hack in some places, it also seems to be practical enough to contribute to its popularity.
17:36:11 <dons> however, as we've discussed, I'd like to implement cabalAndLoad, for example
17:36:34 <SyntaxNinja> dons: ah, OK.
17:36:40 <SyntaxNinja> that's what I was hoping :)
17:36:49 <dons> didn't make it into 0.9.10 unfortunately
17:36:55 <TFK> (Although in many places of Python hacks they wouldn't done better by thinking... go figure :-/ )
17:37:01 <SyntaxNinja> dons: have you done any work on it?
17:37:06 <dons> not yet
17:37:09 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: yeah, I guess htat's what folks worry about
17:37:13 <dons> but I don't see it being too hard.
17:37:44 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: those are ratings from the three reviewers, on a scale of [A,B,C,D]
17:37:49 <dons> Lemmih, AAB? two accepts, and one maybe accept?
17:41:27 <SyntaxNinja> I just posted this, fwiw: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2005-July/004082.html
17:42:29 <SyntaxNinja> (about the FilePath discussion)
17:46:23 * Lemmih would click on that if he had a mouse.
17:46:28 <Lemmih> (:
18:19:29 <Khisanth> Lemmih: type it
20:04:12 * shapr throws lambdas
20:07:42 <dbremner> shapr - hi
20:08:28 <shapr> hiya dbremner, what's up?
20:08:53 <dbremner> shapr - not much, still looking for work. Yourself?
20:09:06 <shapr> Looking for other work :-)
20:09:09 <lament> ah! a lambda hit me in the eye!
20:09:10 * lament dies
20:09:15 <Pseudonym> Mmmm... lambdas.
20:09:19 <Pseudonym> Making me hungry.
20:09:40 <shapr> hey Pseudonym, can call-by-need ever have two thunks to choose from?
20:10:08 <Pseudonym> Not with normal-order, I don't thinmk.
20:10:19 <shapr> For example, will the two thunks in (const 1 5 + const 1 4) be 'equal' ? or will one always be eval'd before the other?
20:10:48 <Pseudonym> However, Haskell doesn't precisely guarantee normal order reduction.
20:11:12 <Pseudonym> In the case of your example, const could be inlined by the compiler.
20:11:20 <shapr> The SMP GHC paper says that whenever one thread is eval'ing a thunk and another one asks for that thunk, the asking thread should block. I was wondering if maybe it could backtrack and eval another thunk instead.
20:11:25 <Pseudonym> Or strictness analysis could kick in and some things get evaluated early.
20:11:43 <Pseudonym> Well, that's my preferred semantics too. :-)
20:11:46 <Pseudonym> Get get work done.
20:11:55 <shapr> Question is, does cbn allow that?
20:11:57 <Pseudonym> However, I think that bloats the code a bit,.
20:12:23 <Pseudonym> I think that cbn and multi-threading are orthogonal.
20:13:13 <Pseudonym> The thing is, in a lazy language, it doesn't actually matter.
20:13:22 <shapr> How so?
20:13:26 <Pseudonym> Just so long as something isn't evaluated unless it's definitely needed.
20:13:40 <shapr> Right, but... can you need two things at once?
20:13:43 <Pseudonym> The multi-threading thing is just a performance issue.
20:13:48 <Pseudonym> Well, yes.
20:13:53 <shapr> My first intuition is that you can only need one thing at a time.
20:14:04 <Pseudonym> For example, strictness analysis can prove that several things will definitely all be needed.
20:14:19 <Pseudonym> And SOP is to evaluate them early.
20:15:58 <shapr> Since this idea isn't obviously incorrect, I'll ask JaffaCake when I see him next, thanks for the bounce.
20:16:13 <Pseudonym> No problem.
20:16:18 <Pseudonym> I really need to eat now.
20:16:24 <Pseudonym> So I shall do that.  BBS
20:44:08 * lispy waves
20:46:47 * shapr particles
20:48:48 <dbremner> shapr - have you heard of Bram's law?
20:49:05 <lispy> dbremner: is this about dracula?
20:49:13 <dons> hehe
20:49:36 <lispy> dons: hi, does Yi work on the mac?
20:49:47 * lispy thinks it's time to find out
20:50:55 <lispy> nice, hs-plugins is in darwinports
20:56:19 <shapr> dbremner: Can't recall it at the moment.
20:56:30 <dons> lispy,, maybe ...
20:56:34 <dons> don't see why not
20:57:03 <lispy> i forget did i need to install any packages besides hs-plugins?
20:57:04 <dbremner> shapr - http://www.advogato.org/person/Bram/diary.html?start=68
20:57:21 <Speck> Can someone explain to me what F-algebras and G-algebras are? (note: this may involve follow-up questions, but googling for these two things proved unhelpful)
20:59:49 <shapr> dbremner: That's a cool law.
21:00:00 <dons> once you've got hs-plugins, you should be ok. but you need darcs or hs-plugins 0.9.10
21:00:40 <lispy> dons: i just sent you a darcs patch, did you get it?
21:00:47 <shapr> I agree with Bram's law, but not his conclusion.
21:01:22 <shapr> For example, the simple and easy code in Plone is nearly always broken. That does not mean it saves me time to ignore it and use it the way it is.
21:01:28 <lispy> dons: i mostly sent it as a test, but it also fixes a very minor problem with the README
21:02:03 <lispy> dons: if it doesn't show up in your email i'd like to know.
21:02:36 <dons> not yet...
21:02:42 <lispy> okay
21:02:50 <lispy> then i need to configurize some stuff
21:03:55 <lispy> i don't think sendmail is setup to actually send
21:03:56 <shapr> The sucky part about Plone is that I always get stuck in the rut of "I have to upgrade to unreleased cvs versions to fix known bugs, usually ending with two unknown bugs for every known bug fixed"
21:05:28 <dbremner> shapr - ouch.
21:05:29 <shapr> I wrote the code to solve my current task in one hour. The code didn't work because of Plone bugs. I have spent three days trying to fix the bugs so my code will work. So far I'm not any closer.
21:07:18 <dbremner> shapr - how frequently is Plone upgraded? Could it make sense to maintain your own stable branch?
21:08:21 <shapr> Yes, but I'd have to maintain stable branches of all the Plone extensions that I use as well.
21:08:29 <shapr> Here are shapr's laws - http://www.scannedinavian.com/2004-12-09.html
21:09:45 <shapr> I would put up more blog entries, but I broke Plog, and can't seem to rebuild it.
21:10:35 <dbremner> shapr - I read the archives of your blog and there were several that I could relate to.
21:12:05 <shapr> Anything in particular?
21:13:10 <dbremner> shapr - May 30th 2004, for one.
21:14:15 <shapr> Yeah, that's a good realization.
21:15:01 <dons> hey shapr, yi's going to the haskell workshop :D
21:15:01 <dbremner> shapr - March 3rd, 2005 was another.
21:15:06 <shapr> One thing I learned from that is that there are two flavors of fun activities for me, things I want to accomplish, and things I want to do.
21:15:09 <shapr> dons: awesome!!
21:16:15 <shapr> I'm good at things I want to do, like unicycling. There's no goal, the activity is the point. I'm bad at things I want to accomplish, because they only get me one step closer to another 'fun to do' activity.
21:16:56 <shapr> dbremner: Yeah, that one was one of the very rare evil and vicious things I've written.
21:19:13 <shapr> dbremner: Do you have a prescription for Ritalin also?
21:19:15 <shapr> g'day Saulzar
21:19:38 <Saulzar> Hi.
21:20:07 <shapr> Learning Haskell?
21:21:00 <shapr> Or maybe coming to #haskell in search of interesting FP discussion?
21:21:12 <Saulzar> In a way - been learning ocaml, but all the interesting documents/tutorials on functional style use haskell :)
21:21:49 <shapr> Haskell does force the functional style.
21:21:56 <shapr> There is no escape into mutability.
21:24:18 <Saulzar> I actually looked at Haskell first, but ocaml seems a reasonable comprimise for a hardline imperitive programmer to tackle to begin with ;)
21:24:44 <shapr> I don't compromise well. I jumped from Python into Haskell.
21:25:03 <shapr> It was brain twisting, but it did work out.
21:26:57 <Saulzar> I'm intrigued as to how one goes about designing the top level of a purely functional program... it seems a lot of work to shuffle the data around
21:27:41 <Saulzar> I'm just reading on monads - been reading a very nice paper on parser combinators, I guess that's one of the primary ways it's done in haskell at least
21:28:31 <shapr> There are a bunch of useful idioms on the Haskell wiki.
21:29:39 <shapr> I'm fond of building pure lazy pipelines and then calling those from the top level.
21:30:36 <shapr> But then, I really like laziness, and I think most people don't.
21:30:52 <shapr> Anyway, sleeptime for me, bbl
21:30:54 * shapr &
21:31:09 <Speck> I started haskell with parsec
21:31:26 <Speck> perhaps a mistake in retrospect, but it worked out all right
21:33:33 <gzl> Parsec is neat
21:33:49 <lispy> dons: you should get the patch file now
21:36:07 <lispy> dons: FWIW, you need alex also...
21:36:49 <lispy> but that's in darwinports so no worries...
21:38:12 <dons> got it
21:40:25 <lispy> cool
21:40:54 <lispy> oh, happy is needed as well
21:41:17 <lispy> which is also in darwinports.  I guess darwinports is really haskell friendly

21:46:42 <lispy>  
21:46:56 <lispy> dons: does that mean anything to you?
21:47:40 <dons> hmm..cpp version maybe?
21:47:59 <dons> maybe you can force traditional mode on cpp?
21:48:35 <lispy> powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.0 (GCC) 4.0.0 20041026 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 4061)
21:48:36 <lispy>  
21:48:50 <lispy> dons: any idea how to do that?
21:49:28 <dons> what's going on in regex.h line 145 anyway?
21:50:16 <lispy> #ifdef __REG_VOID_T
21:50:17 <lispy> typedef __REG_VOID_T re_void;
21:50:17 <lispy> #else
21:50:17 <lispy>  
21:50:33 <lispy> that looks fine to mee
21:50:47 <dons> gcc 4 is weird
21:51:01 <dons> don't happen to have 3.{3,4} around?
21:51:05 <lispy> yes
21:51:40 <lispy> ah, and they have gcc_select
21:51:45 <lispy> i just run that and it changes the default
21:51:59 <dons> see if that helps
21:52:08 <lispy> is there a make clean?
21:52:16 <lispy> make clean tries to continue the build
21:54:30 <lispy> well it doesn't help
21:54:37 <lispy> but i think i need to clean the build
21:54:48 <dons> make clean FAST=1 ?
21:55:03 <dons> check the readme..
21:55:06 <lispy> okay, that work
21:55:13 <dons> "make clean FAST=1       -- remove anything, fast!" ;)0
21:55:35 <lispy> i get the same error when i try to make again
21:56:32 <lispy> In file included from Regex.hsc:48:

21:56:32 <lispy>  
21:56:42 <lispy> so something is definitely funny
21:56:59 <dons> is that using the right gcc?
21:57:15 <lispy> how can we tell?
21:57:22 <dons> add -v
21:57:40 <dons> you can force the version with -pgmc for the c compiler, and -pgmp for the prepreprocessor
21:57:46 <dons> preprepreprocessor!
21:58:02 <lispy> hmm...i can't even find where it calls CC
21:58:06 <Pseudonym> That's seriously disturbing.
21:58:12 <Pseudonym> It's turtles all the way down.
21:58:45 <musasabi> lispy: is it possible that __REG_VOID_T is defined to an empty value?
21:59:05 <lispy> musasabi: uh....sure
21:59:10 <lispy> musasabi: i have no idea :)
22:00:14 <lispy> #ifdef __REG_VOID_T
22:00:14 <lispy> #undef __REG_VOID_T
22:00:14 <lispy> #endif
22:00:14 <lispy>  
22:00:19 <lispy> that's in regex.h
22:00:44 <lispy> oh
22:00:51 <lispy> later itis set to VOID
22:01:37 <lispy> i wonder if it's getting typedef VOID re_void; as input
22:08:32 <lispy> i added -v -pgmc -pgmp to C_OPTS in mk/config.mk but it doesn't improve the output

23:21:28 <Helmutt> Hello all! I'm very new to haskell, and trying to learn, so be nice ;) My tutorial doesn't tell what the .. operator(?) can do. I've tried it myself on a list like [1..10] and got a list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Can it do something more? I tried to get it's type with :t (..) but it didn't work. Is it just syntactical sugar?
23:22:35 <Cale> It's syntax sugar for enumFromTo
23:23:00 <Cale> you can also write [1,3..9] to get odd numbers, for instance
23:23:14 <Cale> and [1,3..] for the list of all positive odd numbers
23:23:45 <Cale> [1..] will give the list of positive integers
23:24:39 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html -- see class Enum
23:24:47 <Helmutt> Ok! Thanks! But where can I get info about functions like enumFromTo? Is there some sort of reference?
23:25:21 <Cale> enumFromTo is a prelude function, so you can see a sample implementation there (an actual implementation just has to do the same thing)
23:26:04 <Cale> In fact, it's a method of the Enum typeclass, so the implementation for each type may be somewhat different.
23:26:39 <Cale> (note that, for instance ['a'..'z'] works)
23:27:13 <Helmutt> Ok, irn't there a more general api like java or python got?
23:27:29 <dons> @where hier
23:27:30 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html
23:27:58 <dons> all the code that's fit to commiit
23:29:07 <Cale> The documentation could be better in places, but the list is certainly looking more and more impressive. :)
23:34:14 <Helmutt> Nice! Now I got something to read :D
23:48:29 <boegel> @yow
23:48:32 <lambdabot> All of a sudden, I want to THROW OVER my promising ACTING CAREER,
23:48:32 <lambdabot> grow
23:48:32 <lambdabot> a LONG BLACK BEARD and wear a BASEBALL HAT!! ...  Although I don't
23:48:32 <lambdabot> know
23:48:32 <lambdabot> WHY!!
23:48:56 <boegel> @bye
23:48:58 <lambdabot> bzzt
23:55:14 <Helmutt> When using ' in var names, what does it mean?
23:55:59 <astrolabe> I think a' is just another variable
23:56:55 <Helmutt> and a'' then is that a new variable to? I mean wouldn't the compiler get '' like a char?
23:57:24 <mflux_> no
23:57:50 <mflux_> @plugs let a'''' = 42 in a''''
23:57:52 <lambdabot> 42
23:58:05 <mflux_> I suppose it can't be the first character though
23:58:55 <Helmutt> Ok, thanks!
