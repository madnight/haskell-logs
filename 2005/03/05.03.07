00:00:12 <pesco> I have the darc suspicion that the lack of UTF-8 input is rootet in Happy maybe?
00:00:23 <pesco> (The use Happy for the parser, don't they?)
00:00:29 <skew> Happy has nothing to do with the lexing, though
00:00:34 <pesco> No? Oh, ok.
00:00:42 <pesco> I've never used it.
00:00:45 <skew> I think they use Alex for that
00:01:09 <pesco> Ah. Hm.
00:01:16 <skew> A table driven parser wouldn't be too happy with unicode, I think.
00:01:26 <skew> I don't know if UTF-8 would be much better
00:01:31 <a5> skew: the program you have in ~/bin. or, why is it useful.
00:01:53 <pesco> skew: I don't follow.
00:02:35 <skew> a5: I don't like how locate lists all the subdirectories of anything matching the search word.
00:02:59 <a5> ah. i think locate should change, shouldn't it? that's super-braindead of it.
00:03:26 <skew> pesco: I'm pretty sure alex generates an explicit state machine, with a bunch of 256 element arrays saying what state to go to next if you get this character in this state
00:03:52 <a5> but that's a cool solution
00:04:13 <pesco> skew: EEK!
00:04:37 <pesco> So there's probably the reason they can't parse Unicode. :(
00:05:43 <skew> a5: Actually that's quadradic so the final version takes the few lines to define a nubBy that assumes only adjacent lines can be "equal"
00:08:12 <skew> Anyways, about this paper I'm writing, I'm not sure who I should write it for.
00:09:19 <Gahhh> you can write for me
00:09:30 <Gahhh> :)
00:10:00 <a5> Core 1?
00:10:07 <skew> I'm an undergrad, not a type theorist. I don't have anything close to a comprehensive view of the subject, so writing something actually useful to a type theoriest as a review paper (the general assignment) is right out.
00:10:49 <skew> a5: not quite. Core 1 is just gone this year. It's something called E11, 1 term, 3 units.
00:11:22 <a5> aha. exciting.
00:11:56 <skew> Each department is making their own writing class. E11 is the general one. The CS department doesn't have one yet, I think, but I can take the math department version if I fail this :)
00:12:20 <skew> Gahhh: so what sort of paper on types and Haskell and such do you want?
00:14:04 <a5> so ... i wrote a library to do naive bayesian inference this weekend. it uses StateT. i guess the most interesting part is the stuff for manipulating probability distributions and maps of distributions.
00:14:16 <a5> http://ofb.net/~frederik/nb/ http://ofb.net/~frederik/nb.tar.gz
00:15:16 <a5> if people want to comment on it. i just did a simple example from an AI textbook to test it but i want to do something like HMMs next to illustrate that the network structure can be arbitrary
00:16:31 <skew> I think I can provide enough context to maybe be actually useful for somebody relatively new to typed functional programming
00:17:30 <skew> Gahhh: not interested in a paper?
00:17:39 <Gahhh> skew: I was messing aroun :0
00:17:41 <Gahhh> :)
00:17:44 <a5> skew: who will be reading it? it doesn't sound like a super engaging topic.
00:17:50 <a5> for a layman i mean
00:18:13 <a5> maybe not, i don't know. the curry-howard isomorphism is cool
00:18:16 <skew> probably the prof teaching the class, maybe the poor soul who sits next to me on tread-papers-day
00:18:26 <a5> oh in that case
00:18:27 <skew> trade-papers day, I mean
00:18:39 <skew> But I kinda like the subject myself :)
00:18:43 <a5> so they're getting rid of the dumb core 1 professional graders
00:18:48 <Gahhh> skew, you can write something for the next issue of The Monad Reader (echo...echo...)
00:19:04 <a5> Gahhh: is there such a thing?
00:19:09 <Gahhh> a5: yes
00:19:16 <Gahhh> The first issue was out a few days ago
00:19:43 <Gahhh> I don't have the link handy. Check out lambda-the-ultimate.org. Shapr posted in the forums.
00:19:51 <Khisanth> it's in the topic
00:19:57 <Gahhh> Bahah
00:20:00 * Gahhh is blind
00:20:25 <Gahhh> I need sleep that's why.
00:20:31 <Gahhh> nite
00:20:37 <skew> That's an interesting idea. I doubt I'll write anything very good, but I'll remember.
00:23:20 <skew> That would mean writing for Haskell users, and being able to assume they've at least heard of monads.
00:34:18 <a5> come on, tell me this isn't brilliant: http://ofb.net/~frederik/nb/NB.hs
00:35:19 <a5> to be sure, i haven't scrounged much for prior art. languages for inference, etc.
00:35:19 <skew> Does anyone know of a good place to find arguments people make against strong static tyes, or the general flavor of people who think dynamicly typed languages (= untyped functions, IMO) are great and are wary about types.
00:36:35 <earthy> yup
00:36:43 <musasabi> c.l.f has had some discussion on that in the past.
00:37:35 <earthy> there's an article by... Larry Paulson and... dunno who closely examining the issues
00:39:30 <skew> thanks
00:41:13 <earthy> duh
00:41:47 <earthy> gotcha. `Should your specification language be typed?' - L. Lamport \and L. C. Paulson, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 21 3 (1999) 502-526
00:43:18 <skew> Oh, I've seen that a bit. I thought it was more about specification languages.
00:45:51 <skew> a5: isn't certain the identity?
00:47:41 <skew> I don't see what the monad is for. The rest looks pretty nice. BE might be more flexible without the superclass constraints.
00:52:54 <Lemmih> Good morning, #haskell.
00:53:01 <skew> Good morning
00:54:02 <skew> earthy: The second sentance of the paper is "The advantages of typed programming languages are obvious, so most computer scientists assume that they should also be used in languages and logics for specification and verification"
00:54:29 <skew> earthy: so I thought it it wasn't exactly what I was looking for the first time I read it
01:02:04 <a5> skew: oh, someone actually looked. yeah, that makes sense.
01:03:30 <a5> good eyes
01:05:52 <a5> skew: will you be working for overture this summer?
01:07:06 <skew> I might be. It's interesting work
01:09:08 <a5> R&D or corporate?
01:10:25 <skew> sort of experimental.
01:10:31 <skew> How did you hear about this anyway?
01:11:15 <a5> i know all
01:11:49 <Svrog> hi everyone
01:11:58 <a5> skew: you have to tell me about NB.hs first
01:12:09 <dblhelix> morning
01:12:51 <a5> hi Svrog
01:13:28 <musasabi> hmm I got a kind of parametrized modules (via records) work :-)
01:18:09 <pesco> musasabi: What did you do?
01:18:26 <skew> a5: What is cause for?
01:20:07 <a5> the burglar example might help
01:20:21 <a5> 'cause' creates a causal link between two events
01:21:00 <a5> but since it's a naive bayes library, we only support trees. so the links fall along function call lines
01:22:27 <a5> 'observe' collapses a distribution to have a certain value
01:22:33 <musasabi> pesco: template haskell to automatically import all fields of a record to current scope.
01:23:18 <pesco> musasabi: Interesting. I should really look into TH some time.
01:27:22 <skew> musasabi: what can you parameterize records by, and what can the records hold?
01:31:01 <skew> musasabi: Can you make abstract types with this somehow?
01:34:13 <musasabi> yes.
01:34:51 <pesco> I have an esoteric question about style: When breaking a type signatures across two lines, where should the arrow go: "foo :: Foo ->\n       Bar" or "foo :: Foo\n       -> Bar" ?!
01:38:19 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/pimport/ contains an example.
01:40:44 <a5> pesco: i always put operators on the previous line
01:41:25 <pesco> a5: I think I'm leaning towards that too. Although sometimes that could make them easy to overlook.
01:41:59 <pesco> It's questions like that which take most of my time.
01:42:06 <pesco> ;)
01:42:19 <skew> pesco: well, you are writing Haskell :)
01:42:31 <pesco> skew: Quite true.
01:42:44 <skew> pesco: Putting the arrow on the next line gets along better with Haddock
01:43:16 <pesco> skew: Ah. I don't use Haddock, so I don't mind.
01:44:08 <skew> If you comment the arguments the options are "foo :: Foo --^ first argument\n       -> Bar --^ second argument" and "foo :: --| First argument\n       Foo -> --| second argument\n     Bar"
01:44:52 <pesco> I see. In such a situation, I think I'd prefer the -> on the next line, too.
01:46:27 <skew> Haddock is a nice tool. I especially like the cross references on all the types in signatures in the generated documentation.
01:46:36 <kosmikus> I think putting an operator last on the line works well for right-associative operators, but looks usually strange in practice
01:46:45 <kosmikus> so most of the time I move the operators to the next line
01:48:09 <skew> pesco: You are using lhs2tex for what documentation you do?
01:48:18 <pesco> skew: It depends.
01:48:55 <pesco> skew: The program I'm currently writing (for work) is a Bird-style lhs.
01:49:51 * a5 goes to bed
01:52:21 <pesco> skew: For programs that are important to me I use lhs2TeX to document the code, preceded by a high-level overview. When I write API docs, I use roff (=> manpages). Less important (or small) programs usually become Bird-lhs.
01:52:25 <musasabi> Is that worth posting to haskell@ ?
01:52:36 <pesco> I next to never write plain .hs.
01:52:41 <skew> pesco: I suppose mixing literate style and Haddock comments is redundant.
01:54:37 <pesco> skew: Maybe not redundant, but the additional comments would certainly make the result "strange" to read.
01:56:17 <pesco> I also think that systems like Haddock encourage general brevity in API documentation, whereas it should be brief on explanation but quite verbose on details.
01:59:44 <skew> earthy: That paper is interesting, but I think the problems they talked about were mostly specific to specification. The conclusion makes the valuable point that types are next to useless without automation, which is very relevent.
02:00:24 <pesco> skew: What exactly do they mean by automation?
02:00:52 <skew> type checkers, type inferencers, theorem provers that take advantege of type information, etc.
02:01:20 <pesco> I see.
02:01:21 <skew> In the context of programming languages we usually just have type checking and inference
02:01:51 <pesco> What if we lacked inference?
02:01:56 <skew> but the paper is about specification languages, where typed specification languages can help an automated verification tool build a proof
02:02:52 <Itkovian> If I have a [(String, String, Integer, Integer, Double)], and I want it printed decently, i.e. newlines between every item of the list, () removed, [] removed, how can I do that without defining a new datatype for which I can derive from Show?
02:03:19 <Itkovian> I want to be able to call show on it ...
02:03:31 <skew> Itkovian: you can't
02:03:54 <skew> Itkovian: you could write the pretty printer that the Show instance for the newtype would use and just call that
02:04:16 <skew> Or you could use some kind of pretty-printer typeclass
02:04:32 <Itkovian> skew: Ah. erm ...
02:05:30 <skew> Show, or at least the show :: a -> String bit is more about being able to write simple values than nicely formatting complicated output
02:05:49 <skew> let me see where the ppr stuff lives...
02:07:04 <skew> Text.PrettyPrint may be useful
02:08:36 <skew> or you could just use "unlines . map show", if you want something readable
02:08:47 <Cale> Itkovian: If you have tuples (String, String, Integer, Integer, Double), it is likely that you should be using a new datatype anyway.
02:09:33 <skew> That's a good idea
02:09:39 <skew> Itkovian: what do you want the output for?
02:13:00 <Itkovian> Cale: maybe, but it's just a list of data ...
02:13:12 <Itkovian> skew: to read it into R :-)
02:15:04 <Cale> Itkovian: oh, okay, usually data of that type have nameable fields. If you want to redefine Show, you do need a new datatype though
02:15:18 <Cale> anyway, I'd better sleep
02:30:32 <Itkovian> I really have a memory issue here...
02:31:14 <tromp> familiar problem:)
02:31:29 <Itkovian> for a 93000 line file, reading it, building a list of the lines, putting each line into a datastructure, sorting that, grouping it, mapping a function on each group (there are no more than 100 groups), it takes a bloody > 1gig
02:33:35 <Oejet> Itkovian: What's the minimum theoretical memory usage?
02:35:32 <musasabi> about 150mb
02:35:50 <musasabi> if the lines are strings and 100 chars on average.
02:36:13 <musasabi> + add subtle lazyness.
02:36:28 <musasabi> (93000 * 100 * 16) / (1024*1024)
02:36:37 <musasabi> but => lunch
02:38:16 <shapr> skew: ltns!
02:38:25 <skew> hi shapr
02:38:31 <musasabi> morning shapr
02:38:53 <tromp> hi, shapr
02:38:59 <Itkovian> Oejet: each line has about 50 fields, the first two are stored as a stringm the others as Integers
02:39:21 <tromp> 16 bytes is for a Char as a list element?
02:39:52 <musasabi> yes
02:40:36 <skew> how much memory does it take just to sort the list?
02:40:50 <tromp> getContents ... lines... sort
02:41:14 <Itkovian>      28           [filename]  -> do file     <- openFile filename ReadMode
02:41:14 <Itkovian>      29                             contents <- hGetContents file
02:41:14 <Itkovian>      30                             putStr $ show . (map unify) . group . sort . process $ contents
02:41:38 <basti_> hi
02:41:43 <pesco> Hi.
02:41:58 <skew> Itkovian: does group assume the list has been sorted?
02:42:16 <Itkovian> yes.
02:42:21 <Itkovian> afaik it does
02:42:38 <Itkovian> @eval Data.List.group [1,2,3,1,2,3]
02:42:39 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
02:42:41 <tromp> it doesn't, but will only group adjacent equal stuff
02:42:42 <Itkovian> hmm
02:42:51 <Itkovian> well, yes, that's what I meant
02:42:56 <Itkovian> @listcommands
02:42:56 <lambdabot> I react to the following commands: ["all-dicts","arr","cmafihe","define
02:42:56 <lambdabot> ,"definitions","del-definition","devils","dict","dict-help","dummy","dump

02:43:08 <tromp> yow
02:43:41 <ozone> cmafihe?
02:45:04 <skew> Itkovian: so everything but the sort should just be lazily streaming data along
02:46:24 <basti_> shapr?
02:46:31 <skew> can you sort the data ahead of time?
02:46:35 <Itkovian> hmm ...
02:46:44 <Itkovian> using a unix sort, yes.
02:47:31 <Itkovian> skew: but that's not nice, kinda wierd to use unix cmd line tools to do something at which haskell should be excellent
02:47:48 <shapr> basti_: yes?
02:48:07 <basti_> shapr how is the planning for TMR 2 going? Which form will it be published in?
02:48:11 <skew> Haskell has large constant factors...
02:48:33 <shapr> I haven't had time to plan anything so far.
02:48:47 <Itkovian> skew: yeah, ok, but up to a gig?
02:48:54 <shapr> I have a bunch of client work right now.
02:48:56 <skew> Remember, 16 bytes per character in a string ...
02:48:56 <Itkovian> and I refuse to use perl :-)
02:49:19 <Itkovian> skew: ok, but them strings are quite short ... usually 1-6 chars
02:49:28 <Itkovian> thus 93000 * 6 * 2
02:49:38 <Itkovian> erm 93000 * 6 * 2 * 16
02:49:54 * Itkovian read bits instead of bytes
02:49:59 <Itkovian> howcome it takes 16 bytes?
02:50:58 <basti_> shapr i will then try to prepare for both html and latex...
02:51:29 <tromp> r 4 for a unicode char, 4 for a link, 1-4 for a tag ...
02:51:48 <Itkovian> ok
02:51:53 <Itkovian> dang.
02:51:53 <tromp> and 16 to round it up to a nice 2 power:(
02:51:57 <skew> tromp: oh, that's not counting the cost of the cons cell?
02:52:15 <Itkovian> isn't unicode 2 bytes?
02:52:22 <tromp> oh, right, it has another link to the char
02:52:45 <Itkovian> insane
02:52:59 <tromp> so 2links, 2bytes char, and 2 tags
02:53:04 <Itkovian> I ... will ... not ... use ... perl ...
02:53:17 <skew> All that indirection buys you laziness
02:53:35 <Itkovian> it'd better buy some memory
02:53:48 <Itkovian> my machine has only 512 megs ... another one is one the way ...
02:53:57 * Itkovian eats
02:54:25 <skew> You could try an IOUArray or a Ptr Char
02:54:45 <skew> Or you could just sort the data ahead of time and then run your program in constant space...
02:54:51 <tromp> nono, compiler shld just optimize for common case of [Char]
02:55:18 <skew> tromp: how?
02:55:34 <tromp> and fall back on list repr if you're doing nasty things to array repr
02:56:36 <Itkovian> wow ...
02:56:54 <Itkovian> at 40 meg and going steady ;-)
02:56:59 <skew> I think somebody had a nice library for working with lists of buckets of primitive arays
02:57:09 <skew> Itkovian: see, that's what the laziness buys you :)
02:57:17 <Itkovian> ah rsiing to 105 now ...
02:57:21 <skew> aww
02:57:25 <ozone> you could just use perl
02:57:27 <Itkovian> 124 ..
02:57:31 <Itkovian> 152 ...
02:57:33 <Itkovian> dang.
02:57:41 <tromp> how? just store n chars in an array of size n' with a thunk for remaining chars, where n' is next 2power larger than n
02:57:42 <skew> Did you sort the data?
02:58:07 <Itkovian> yes
02:58:07 <skew> and drop the sort from your program?
02:58:11 <Itkovian> ahead of time
02:58:16 <Itkovian> yes.
02:58:19 <skew> Hmm
02:58:22 <Itkovian> 208 ...
02:58:25 <Itkovian> 229...
02:58:34 <tromp> when u run out of array, allocate one twice as big
02:58:41 <Itkovian> 245 251 257 267
02:59:06 <skew> Is there any reason it should be hangning on to all the input?
02:59:13 <skew> has it printed anything yet?
02:59:15 <Itkovian> no reason at all
02:59:18 <Itkovian> yes it prints ...
02:59:22 <Itkovian> thus it could drop the garbage
02:59:23 <skew> hmm
02:59:38 <Itkovian> dang my stack overflew ... hmmm
02:59:39 <pesco> Itkovian: Run a heap profile.
03:00:12 <pesco> The space leaks I've had were usually fixed by a single seq in the right place.
03:00:23 <Itkovian> there's nothing recursive in there afaik ... well, the fold is ... but wtf ...
03:00:50 <Itkovian> ok, I'll post it on the pastepage
03:04:03 <Itkovian> pasted.
03:06:42 <Itkovian> remarks are welcome.
03:10:35 <basti_> Itkovian url?
03:11:02 <skew> HaskellIrcPastePage on the wiki
03:15:10 <skew> I haven't spotted any excessive strictness or leaks
03:15:14 <Itkovian> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
03:15:15 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
03:15:25 <skew> What does a retainer profile show you?
03:15:34 <Itkovian> it hasn't finished yet
03:15:39 <Itkovian> running on an opteron now ...
03:15:44 <skew> maybe you should use smaller input for testing
03:15:45 <Itkovian> takes 1.145 gig atm
03:16:03 <Itkovian> maybe yeas... through smaller input it flies ...
03:16:26 <skew> It should still have any space leak
03:16:32 <Itkovian> true.
03:16:49 <Itkovian> lengths of the groups are:
03:16:50 <Itkovian> [7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,2,4,6,10,2,748,2,62417,25473,1,1,1]
03:17:39 <skew> hmm. I had been assuming that any strictness in processing a single line or group was okay, but it would be serious on that data
03:20:01 <Lunar^> shapr: congrats for TMR 1
03:20:17 <skew> Itkovian: I think unify is your problem
03:21:12 <Itkovian> yeah ... it seems the only possible place where trouble may be hiding ...
03:21:19 <skew> Try a run without it and see what you get
03:22:25 <skew> unify is just building a thunk for the fold over 60000 elements, which isn't evalatued until you try to print
03:22:41 <Itkovian>         total time  =      165.08 secs   (8254 ticks @ 20 ms)
03:22:41 <Itkovian>         total alloc = 21,610,948,204 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)
03:22:59 <Itkovian> process                        Main                  79.4   86.1
03:22:59 <Itkovian> splitRegexWithMatches          Regex                 18.0    9.8
03:23:02 <Itkovian> hmm
03:23:22 <Itkovian> 86.1 of the alloc is due to process if I understand this correctly?
03:25:21 <skew> Process should just be parsing each line, right?
03:25:41 <Itkovian> yeah.
03:25:46 <Itkovian> that's right.
03:26:15 <Itkovian> I did a run without unify, but with length instead, and lo'!
03:26:35 <skew> Itkovian: what happened?
03:26:39 <Itkovian> total alloc:  3,381,662,172 bytes
03:27:24 <skew> what about peak memory?
03:27:36 <Itkovian> erm, how do I measure that?
03:27:58 <Itkovian> total mem usage using 'top' is still about a gig.
03:28:05 <skew> Itkovian: right, process is going to allocate tons of memory, making strings, calling regular expression stuff, etc. The question is how much is live at any one time.
03:28:22 <Itkovian> splitRegexWithMatches          Regex                 84.2   52.9
03:28:26 <skew> Read the stuff about heap profiling in the users guide
03:28:33 <Itkovian> I'm doing that right now
03:28:41 <skew> I don't remember exactly how, but you can make a nice graph of memory against time
03:28:59 <skew> and shade it by which functions are hanging onto the memory
03:29:41 <skew> there's an option like --auto-all that sticks in profiling centers all over the place so you can get a good idea where the memory goes
03:35:21 * boegel greets
03:37:10 <araujo> Hello boegel
03:37:16 <araujo> Good morning haskelleres
03:39:27 <boegel> hey araujo
03:41:08 <Muad_Dibber> morning
03:51:16 <boegel> it's awfully quiet in here
03:51:26 <Muad_Dibber> so start talking :)
03:51:28 <basti_> i could make a sound.
03:51:39 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: I am talking :p
03:51:52 <Muad_Dibber> boegel : i was typing that before you started talking
03:51:55 <Muad_Dibber> i was reading your mind
03:52:45 <boegel> that's just scary
03:55:40 <Muad_Dibber> anything nice you working on currently?
03:55:52 <boegel> who? me ?
03:56:01 <Muad_Dibber> or anyone else :P
03:56:19 <musasabi> I think I got today something nice.
03:56:21 <boegel> I'm working on compilers-stuff for uni
03:56:32 <boegel> musasabi: tell us !
03:57:12 <musasabi> cheap parametrized modules - really just a way to import records (which can repreresent par. modules) into top-level scope.
03:57:48 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/pimport/
03:57:59 <shapr> punny name
03:58:49 * pesco giggles.
04:01:52 <Muad_Dibber> haskell humor :)
04:02:17 <boegel> does anybody know a good drum 'n bass internet radio ?
04:02:32 <boegel> which doesn't require any fancy software to be installed...
04:04:08 <goron> Muad_Dibber: Aren't you in the wrong channel? ;)
04:05:47 <Muad_Dibber> goron : is there a #haskell-lamer also then? :)
04:07:15 <goron>  /j #haskell-lamer will do the trick. I don't think it's very crowded, but you might start a revolution... (:
04:08:45 <Muad_Dibber> i'm not the revolutionary type though :)
04:08:47 <nlv11757_> earth to earthy
04:45:46 * shapr yodels
04:46:21 <shapr> Right, it's time for work.
04:52:34 <musasabi> http://wiki.ffii.org/Cons050307En softwarepatents + EU :-(
04:56:45 <arjanb> that smells of a conspiracy
04:57:03 <desrt> ya.  wtf
04:57:11 <desrt> why aren't more people making a big deal out of that?
05:02:54 <Oejet> Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
05:06:08 <Oejet> Incredible.
05:07:53 <bourbaki> moin
05:08:43 <Itkovian> omfg
05:08:49 <Itkovian> what a bunch of idiots!
05:12:33 <Itkovian> no wonder Jonas is pissed today
05:19:51 <Oejet> TMR logo proposal: http://www.informatimago.com/users/pascal/dead-lambda.png
05:21:15 <Itkovian> hmm
05:21:21 <Itkovian> a living lambda might be better ;-)
05:21:27 <Itkovian> add some colour too ...
05:21:46 <bourbaki> whats that for?
05:22:00 <bourbaki> the dead lambdas club ;)?
05:23:11 <kosmikus> it's a funny logo, but I don't like it for TMR
05:35:36 <Oejet> It was meant as a humorous diversion.
05:36:13 <Itkovian> well, I like it, bu not for on TMR ...
05:36:26 <Itkovian> Oejet: are you into drawing skeletons?
05:37:20 <Oejet> Itkovian: It's not mine, though.  Found the link on #lisp.
05:38:22 <Itkovian> ah
05:59:08 <Itkovian> if I call putStrLn recursively on a list, how can I end the recursion without introducing an extra putStr?
06:02:58 <TheHunter> Itkovian, return () ?
06:04:37 <Itkovian> right!
06:04:53 <Itkovian> dang this monad stuff isn't my thing ...
06:06:01 <TheHunter> you know mapM_?
06:06:12 <Itkovian> yes.
06:06:21 <Itkovian> yes. :-)
06:06:27 <metaperl> Cale, ping
06:07:56 <Itkovian> TheHunter: thx.
06:38:49 <nlv11757_> is earthy among us?
06:39:04 <nlv11757_> @seen earthy
06:39:04 <lambdabot> earthy is in #haskell.
06:47:22 * Lemmih wonders why the ThingsToAvoid wikipage still claims that syntactic sugar doesn't help to make programs more maintainable.
06:47:38 <bourbaki> is someone is interested in differential equations http://rafb.net/paste/results/jvqgi420.html
06:49:06 <desrt_gabriel> differential equations are just about the most uninteresting thing i can think of :)
06:49:36 <vegai> ever heard of category theory? :P
06:50:25 <desrt_gabriel> hahahah
06:52:17 <Itkovian> Lemmih: can't you edit it?
06:53:08 <Lemmih> Itkovian: I think TheHunter tried that several times before.
06:54:06 <xerox> @wiki ThingsToAvoid
06:54:07 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThingsToAvoid
06:54:40 <desrt_gabriel> @wiki NoSuchTopic
06:54:41 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/NoSuchTopic
06:54:46 <desrt_gabriel> that's disappointing
06:56:08 <Lemmih> desrt_gabriel: Any other behaviour wouldn't be desirable.
06:56:35 <desrt_gabriel> i sort of agree
07:04:46 <vegai> the guy(s) who wrote that does no seem to like guards too much either
07:06:11 <tuomov> http://mjr.iki.fi/texts/patentfund
07:06:13 <tuomov> :)
07:06:56 <vegai> heh
07:07:26 <earthy> wow... once again I am reminded of the costs of doing science
07:08:03 <earthy> looking up On the Soundness and Completeness of Equational Predicate Logics by G. Tourlakis in the Journal of Logic and Computation 2001 11(4):623-653
07:08:07 <earthy> resulted in
07:08:11 <earthy> You may access this article (from the computer you are currently using) for 24 hours for US$25.50
07:09:25 <vegai> they expect you to absorb it completely in that time
07:09:32 <vegai> or if you're too dumb for that, pay more :-P
07:10:02 <MegaMonad> Hi clog, welcome to #haskell !
07:10:09 <vegai> MegaMonad: Uh oh.
07:10:11 <MegaMonad> vegai: Oh oh what is required.
07:12:48 <dblhelix> MegaMonad: someone just mentioned that category theory is rather boring? what do you think about category theory?
07:12:49 <MegaMonad> dblhelix: How many times i such a category as a different error messages..  Hugs was more or less throw away the boring version of hs-plugins.
07:13:06 <dblhelix> fair enough
07:13:24 <vegai> MegaMonad: many things seem boring before you understand them, wouldn't you agree?
07:13:25 <MegaMonad> vegai: Ask hugs for me, but i wouldn't be a natural at the code a bit, for example, a little boring :p.
07:13:46 <vegai> he's transfixed on hugs now
07:13:56 <vegai> MegaMonad: do you need a hug?
07:13:58 <MegaMonad> vegai: In java it's common not to me you need a hug?
07:14:24 <dblhelix> MegaMonad: do you prefer hugs over ghc??
07:14:25 <MegaMonad> dblhelix: Then realised it contained one and divide by zero? How are runtime errors with hugs is a ghc to build ghc with ghc5.
07:14:29 <vegai> MegaMonad: are you saying that Java programmers need more hugs?
07:14:31 <MegaMonad> vegai: So i add a layer of decoding depending on how to get hugs to be programmers.
07:19:48 <Remi> hi all
07:27:08 <TheHunter> Lemmih, i haven't got around to writing a counterstatement yet, but i'm still planning to do so ;)
07:28:05 <TheHunter> but i already don't like the religous flavor of that page, i don't wanna start a flamewar.
07:29:36 <TheHunter> s/that page/some parts of that page/
07:36:26 * Remi gets curious
07:39:52 <TheHunter> @wiki ThingsToAvoid
07:39:53 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThingsToAvoid
07:40:26 <TheHunter> "But they don't help to make programs safer (like type checks and contracts) or easier to maintain (like modularization and scoping)"
07:41:20 <TheHunter> i'm disagreeing strongly with that statement, and I don't think the rest of the section is a consensus either.
07:42:54 * Remi has just updated ThingsToAvoid (though not that part)
07:44:45 <vegai> some of the points in "Use syntactic sugar wisely" have to do with hugs
07:44:53 <TheHunter> heh, i didn't like that compose2 stuff either.
07:45:23 <Remi> I definitely _do_ agree with the title, but I don't think I'd like haskell so much without f x = y (instead of f = \x -> y), guards/multiplefunctiondefs(patterns) (instead of case) etc
07:45:51 <vegai> no-one's probably complaning about patterns there
07:47:02 <TheHunter> well, it is arguing against sections and infix operators, both very well-accepted haskell98 features.
07:47:43 <Remi> I've been wondering whether to leave it and growl or remove it for a few weeks I think (compose2)
07:48:23 <Remi> no-one's complaining about patterns (in function definitions instead of in case constructs)?
07:48:36 <Remi> "Syntactic extensions make source code processors complicated and error prone. But they don't help to make programs safer (like type checks and contracts) or easier to maintain (like modularization and scoping)."
07:49:11 <Remi> IMHO _at least_ some syntactic sugar _does_ make programs "easier to maintain", thereby invalidating this statement
07:49:36 <Itkovian> I'm off
07:49:37 <Itkovian> ttyl
07:50:09 <TheHunter> exactly.
07:50:43 <Remi> btw, does anyone feel the need for a wikipedia like discussion page? At least for ThingsToAvoid? ;0
07:51:58 <TheHunter> that's a good idea.
07:52:37 <Remi> any preference for a discussion naming convention?
07:53:18 <Remi> Discuss/ThingsToAvoid, a link on ThingsToAvoid and a line about Discuss/ on the FrontPage?
07:53:24 <vegai> (*) 6 $ (+) 4 2
07:53:31 <vegai> now that's Style
07:53:44 <Remi> its Art
07:53:50 <Remi> or Perl
07:53:56 <ddarius> ($) (* 6) (+ 4 2) ;)
07:54:07 <vegai> hehe
07:54:29 <Remi> which still contains synsugar...
07:54:32 <ddarius> (Adding the parens I messed)
07:55:11 <TheHunter> pff, ((. (+)) . (.) . (*)) 6 4 2
07:55:36 <ddarius> That uses infix operators and sections
07:56:00 <autrijus> 36
07:57:43 <Remi> (apply (times 6) (plus 4 2))
07:57:51 <Remi> if you want LISP, you know where to find it ;)
07:57:58 * Remi ducks and runs
07:58:28 <Igloo> Personally, I prefer   36
07:58:49 <vegai> the revised Answer
07:59:10 <mauke> EVAL: undefined function PLUS
07:59:43 <mauke> (apply (* 6) (+ 4 2))  => APPLY: 6 is not a function name
07:59:57 <Remi> yeah, and I doubt whether most LISPs define functions using currying...
08:00:47 <mauke> probably none of them do
08:00:59 <mauke> (*) is 1, (+) is 0
08:01:13 <mauke> (+ 1 2 3) => 6
08:09:26 * Remi waits for people to have an opinion about a "Discuss/Page" convention
08:10:06 <vegai> we should have a Discuss/Page Discuss/Page to present our opinions
08:19:49 <bourbaki> hell0 halcyon10 :)
08:20:11 <halcyon10> hi!
08:20:21 <Remi> hello
08:21:26 <bourbaki> is there a converter from haskell to latex in a mathematical way?
08:21:35 <bourbaki> i mean that it looks like that
08:23:53 <bourbaki> halcyon10: is new to haskell and could use some help :)
08:24:16 <wilx`> And is 10 years old?
08:24:47 <bourbaki> hehe
08:24:58 <Igloo> bourbaki: lhs2tex is the canonical answer, I think
08:25:02 <bourbaki> maybe 10th dan in math ;)
08:25:20 <halcyon10> lol
08:25:29 <bourbaki> Igloo: does it convert the style from haskell layout to something that looks like my mathbook?
08:25:37 <halcyon10> no halcyon was used already on freenode..
08:25:43 <mauke> http://www.jantar.org/lambdaTeX/ ?
08:25:54 <Igloo> Err, post your mathbook to me and I'll tell you  :-)
08:26:00 <bourbaki> hehe
08:26:20 <bourbaki> i mean does it replace ie Float with |R and such
08:26:49 <mauke> that would be wrong
08:26:55 <Igloo> I don't think it can go that far
08:27:19 <bourbaki> too bad that would be nice
08:27:42 <Igloo> AFAIR it doesn't know about layout so doesn't change the width of things. ICBW though. kosmikus?
08:28:33 <earthy> um
08:28:33 <bourbaki> i would like to use this with haskell
08:28:34 <bourbaki> http://rafb.net/paste/results/3Ox94318.html
08:28:50 <bourbaki> erm this one
08:28:51 <earthy> lhs2tex will allow you to do  stuff like replace Float with |R and such
08:28:52 <bourbaki> http://www.mimio.com/
08:29:18 <earthy> but you have to write the macros to recognize Float and emit {\mathbb R} yourself
08:29:24 <Remi> though I doubt whether it can handle x / y -> \frac{x}{y} and such things...
08:29:37 <earthy> Remi: that's trickier, yes.
08:32:00 <Igloo> earthy: how would this look afterwards?
08:32:01 <Igloo> foo = case (3 :: Float) of 3 -> 4
08:32:01 <Igloo>                            4 -> 5
08:32:23 <Remi> or even "sum (map f s)" -> "\sum_{x \in s} f(x)"... ;o)
08:32:24 <earthy> Igloo: if you add spaces in front of the 2nd 3 and the 2nd 4 those two would line up
08:32:42 <Igloo> earthy: But does it do that?
08:32:45 <earthy> yes.
08:32:55 <earthy> see the docs for the `poly' layout
08:32:57 <Igloo> Oh, nifty
08:33:05 <earthy> 4.5 in the lhs2TeX guid
08:33:06 <earthy> +e
08:33:21 <earthy> and see section 8
08:34:09 <earthy> oh, and formatting directives can be parameterized
08:34:14 <earthy> but that's tricky to use
08:50:41 <Remi> @wiki ThingsToAvoid
08:50:41 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThingsToAvoid
08:50:51 <Remi> I just added the discussion thing
08:51:00 <Remi> though for some reason the link doesn't work
08:52:16 <Remi> (the link to @wiki ThingsToAvoid/Discussion, that is)
08:52:24 <Remi> @wiki ThingsToAvoid/Discussion
08:52:24 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThingsToAvoid/Discussion
08:52:42 <Cale> oh
08:52:55 <Cale> heh, it's because Discussion isn't in CamelCase
08:53:32 <Remi> uhm, that means I'll have to change it into DiscussioN, or is there an explicit this-is-a-wiki-link construct?
08:53:42 <Cale> ["blah"]
08:53:47 <Cale> already got it :)
08:54:04 <Remi> thx :)
08:58:05 <nlv11757_> gnight
08:58:18 <stepcutHM> I think I finally have the core algorithm for a lazy, single-pass assembler
09:01:17 <Philippa_> stepcutHM: "write a lazy parser"?
09:01:55 <ibid> WikiNames are one of the worst ideas in wikis
09:02:02 <kosmikus> Igloo: all lhs2TeX questions answered?
09:02:13 <ibid> mediawiki does it right
09:03:26 <Igloo> Yup, thanks (and thanks to earthy too  :-)  )
09:04:02 <TheHunter> anyone objecting against moving the whole n+k-pattern stuff to the discussion page?
09:08:54 <stepcutHM> I can object if it would help...
09:10:12 <Philippa_> TheHunter: A note that n+k-patterns're controversial and see discussion might be worthwhile
09:10:57 <TheHunter> Philippa_, ok.
09:14:55 <stepcutHM> Philippa_: well, I had to solve the problem of forward jumps, I need to know the byte offset between where I currently am, and where the label is, only I have not even seen the label I am jumping to yet...
09:15:29 <stepcutHM> also, I just remember, I also have to worry about really big jumps, because the jump offset is only 16 bytes
10:05:10 <boegel> hi !
10:05:37 <boegel> I have a quick question... [0..3] works fine, but [3..0] doesn't... anyway to achieve it efficiently ?
10:05:56 <TheHunter> [3,2..0]
10:05:57 <tromp> [3,2..0]
10:06:01 <boegel> I mean, I know reverse [0..3] is the same thing, but that would make stuff a lot slower, wouldn't it ?
10:06:12 <boegel> oh, that works ? :) great !
10:06:34 <boegel> thanks :)
10:08:04 * boegel is off again, lot's of work to do
10:08:20 <boegel> bye
10:28:15 <kristnjov> <3 haskell
10:28:28 <Lemmih> ...
10:32:25 <Remi> interesting
10:36:23 <Oejet> Is that good or bad?
11:14:16 * CosmicRay appears.
11:14:21 <CosmicRay> <vegai> (*) 6 $ (+) 4 2
11:14:22 <CosmicRay> nice.
11:14:28 <CosmicRay> but can you do RPL? :-)
11:14:32 <CosmicRay> err RPN
11:14:55 <CosmicRay> halcyon10: did you get the help you need with haskell?
11:32:54 <scalopus> hi
11:38:24 <Oejet> scalopus: Hello.
11:39:30 <Lemmih> Oejet: Bad, I think.
11:42:56 <musasabi> evening
11:44:45 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: it's quiet in here again.
11:44:47 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: It's surprisingly quiet for so long i wanted a bunch of other stuff too, but every time i get it now :) so what to say. Recursive functions are head, which gives you an e-mail, i mean 6^38.
11:45:01 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: recursive functions are had?
11:45:03 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: The thing to say. Recursive functions are not functions.
11:45:07 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: recursive functions are head?
11:45:08 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Oejet: that's what causing most of the functions with the elements out of a user account on a daily basis is the paramorphism generalization. Is there a way to put all of my different functions are head?
11:45:16 <mflux> megamonad, say, what do you know about mind altering substances?
11:45:18 <MegaMonad> mflux: Want me to go to bremen. Did'nt know about mind altering substances?
11:45:38 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what about drugs?
11:45:39 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: So you go through too much about drugs, that even raver had enough money saved up for shapr's n00b when i get for being up-front.
11:45:54 <Pistos> Mathetes: You not only have grammatically correct responses, you also make sense at least 20% of the time!
11:45:55 <CosmicRay> hmm.
11:46:03 <Mathetes> Pistos: What about the rest of the time?
11:46:34 <CosmicRay> Pistos: didn't notice you were still here :-)
11:46:41 <CosmicRay> Pistos: had a chance to look at haskell much yet?
11:46:45 <Pistos> CosmicRay: I just arrived recently.  :)
11:46:55 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Haskell?  *looks sideways* Uh...
11:47:06 <CosmicRay> that url I sent you :-)
11:49:56 <ibid> shapr has his own n00b? scary
11:50:05 <Pistos> "own n00b"?  That term alone is scary.
11:50:22 <Pistos> Mathetes: Do you have your own n00b?
11:50:29 <Mathetes> Pistos: People need to minimize their material possessions.
11:50:37 <ibid> Pistos: did you see microsoft's guide to leetspeek? :)
11:50:43 <Pistos> ibid: Do share.
11:51:05 <tic> How can I lift something out from a monad?  I have a return value in the Maybe monad, but I want to use it directly so to speak, but without doing a case.
11:51:12 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you don't seem to insult people as often as megamonad.  I think that's a deficiency.
11:51:40 <Pistos> Me?  Or Mathetes?  :)
11:51:43 <ibid> Pistos: http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx
11:51:56 <Pistos> Mathetes: What on earth is a Monad?
11:52:03 <Mathetes> Pistos: Le phreak c'est chic
11:52:05 <Lemmih> tic: fromJust or fmap.
11:52:07 <ibid> tic: you can't do that in general
11:52:16 <ibid> tic: in the specific case of Maybe, you can use fromJust
11:52:26 <tic> okay.. thanks.
11:52:34 <tic> (it's just one extra line, so it's not really -that- bad.)
11:53:01 <Pistos> ibid: Amusing link, thanks.
11:53:45 <ibid> MegaMonad: what's your favourite food?
11:53:46 <MegaMonad> ibid: You're a poorly written program and looking at quotient. Thats exactly the same i had for some food.
11:54:08 <ibid> MegaMonad: me, a program??? and why would i be looking at quotient?
11:54:09 <MegaMonad> ibid: Stepcut: because in the quotient space of the program ?
11:54:19 <ibid> shapr: do you really have your own n00b? :)
11:54:24 * Pistos laughs especially at "Was This Information Useful?  Yes / No"
11:54:32 <ibid> Pistos: what did you answer?
11:54:42 <shapr> my own n00b?
11:54:51 <shapr> You mean my TMR column? channeling my inner n00b?
11:54:53 <Pistos> ibid: I didn't.  :P
11:55:00 <ibid> shapr: megamonad said something about shapr's n00b :)
11:55:08 <shapr> oh, I see.
11:55:20 <ibid> 21:46  <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: So you go through too much about drugs, that even raver had enough money saved up
11:55:21 <Pistos> Mathetes: What's your favourite food?
11:55:23 <ibid>                    for shapr's n00b when i get for being up-front.
11:55:33 <Mathetes> Pistos: Data!
11:55:49 <ibid> we have another bot here?
11:55:55 <ibid> what's it eatrn?
11:55:56 <ibid> eaten
11:56:12 <shapr> whoa, crazy
11:57:00 <shapr> must test my 6to4 setup, brb
11:58:00 <Remi> good evening
11:58:08 <Pistos> Remi: Is it?
11:58:21 <Remi> it is in the netherlands
11:58:28 <ibid> yes it is :)
11:58:39 <Remi> well, definitely evening, the good part I'll have to see yet, but it was more a wish than a statement anyway ;)
11:58:48 * ibid wonders whether i should open the first sg-1 season 8 dvd case
11:59:00 <Pistos> "Fantastico De Luxe is the leading autoinstaller for cPanel servers."
11:59:04 <Pistos> (Whoops, wc)
11:59:33 <Pistos> Remi: :)
11:59:44 <CosmicRay> ibid: !!!
11:59:48 <CosmicRay> ibid: I didn't know that was out yet!
12:00:02 <ibid> CosmicRay: came today (R2)
12:00:13 <CosmicRay> I just put s7 on my greencine queue
12:00:17 <shapr> CosmicRay: I used your 6to4 for Debian HOWTO, thanks!
12:00:21 <Igloo> greencine?
12:00:24 <CosmicRay> scifi channel just finished airing seasons 1 - 6.
12:00:33 <CosmicRay> shapr: I hope it worked :-)
12:00:38 <Pistos> Mathetes: What is 6to4?
12:00:43 <ibid> CosmicRay: you didn't know of the season or the dvd?
12:00:45 <Mathetes> Pistos: I have a !calc function in my IRC channel.
12:00:46 <CosmicRay> Igloo: www.greencine.com...  sorta a non-evil netflix competitor
12:00:48 <shapr> If you notice my address, you'll see it worked fine.
12:00:58 <CosmicRay> ibid: I didn't know that season 8 was out
12:01:05 <CosmicRay> ah ha.  indeed.  excellent.
12:01:09 <ibid> CosmicRay: out on dvd or in general?
12:01:13 <CosmicRay> out on dvd.
12:01:20 <ibid> right
12:01:49 <shapr> So, who can I pick on for TMR issue 2 articles?
12:01:54 <CosmicRay> we had been watching scifi's one-episode-per-day series since they started with season 1 last year
12:01:57 <ibid> damn i made a good casserole
12:02:24 * Lemmih hides from shapr's gaze.
12:02:28 <ibid> CosmicRay: the finnish mtv3 channel that aired sg-1 finished season 5 a month or two ago and looks like they're not buying more
12:02:36 <ibid> CosmicRay: which sucks
12:02:38 <CosmicRay> ibid: bummer
12:03:03 <shapr> y0 Darius, wassup?
12:03:08 <ibid> CosmicRay: i started ordering it on dvd after they started a months long break after season 3 finale a couple of years ago
12:03:43 <ibid> CosmicRay: (it's not usually done here, they usually either show the finale when the next batch starts or they show the next season opener before breaking)
12:03:57 <Darius> heya shapr.  Mostly looking into colored pencil stuff of late rather than programming.
12:04:11 <ibid> CosmicRay: (or at least used to. dunno if they do it the bad way nowadays in general)
12:04:11 <CosmicRay> ibid: I don't see season 8 on amazon either
12:04:14 <CosmicRay> ibid: where did you find it?
12:04:26 <ibid> CosmicRay: preordered on amazon.co.uk
12:04:31 <CosmicRay> ah.
12:04:36 <CosmicRay> what's the release date?
12:04:47 <CosmicRay> shapr: it's surprisingly easy to do 6to4 once you know what to do
12:05:48 <ibid> CosmicRay: http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006L7O84/qid=1110225965/ref=pd_ka_2/026-0885364-1236465
12:06:22 <shapr> So, any cool Haskell code lately?
12:06:43 * tic is pushin' some...
12:07:03 * esap has lots of haskell code, all unfinished :-)
12:07:32 <tic> Hm.. What'd be the best (least code) way to do something like a[i] = 3?
12:07:32 <shapr> I guess I could try to setup SASL again so I can do darcs send from my desktop.
12:08:04 <esap> tic: poke? :-)
12:08:17 <tic> ah.  thanks!  what's its type?
12:08:31 <ibid> tic: depends on what you really want to do :)
12:08:48 <tic> I want to replace item n in the list xs with the item n'
12:08:50 <esap> tic: Ptr a -> a -> IO ()
12:09:18 <ibid> tic: you don't usually want to do that frequently
12:09:29 <ibid> tic: and if you do, you
12:09:33 <tic> ibid, usually not, but in this case, I want to. :)
12:09:35 <shapr> Oh, I can try the ghc6.4 deb in the haskell-unsafe repo.
12:09:40 <ibid> 'd do better to choose another datatype :)
12:09:40 <esap> tic: The problem is, I think that's too low level to be useful :-)
12:09:47 <tic> esap, yup.
12:10:03 <ibid> tic: use zip and map? :)
12:10:05 <tic> ibid, no! :)  i'm doing an interpreter for a language that supports set(xs, i, n)
12:10:10 <tic> hm..
12:10:23 <ibid> tic: do you really want to represent xs as a list, then?
12:10:44 <tic> ibid, it's the easiest way.
12:10:45 <Darius> tic: Why not represent xs as a mutable data type then?
12:11:36 <ibid> something like map f (zip [1..] xs) where f j c | j == i = n | otherwise = c
12:11:48 <shapr> Wow, ten thousand Euro already pledged to the European Anti-Software Patent Bribe Pledge Drive.
12:11:57 <tic> ibid, I suppose that'd work.. Thanks! :)
12:12:07 <Darius> However, modulo error conditions, splitAt, (:), and (++) should be a quick solution.
12:12:35 <tic> splitAt might be what I'm looking for.
12:12:39 <tic> splitAt xs i?
12:12:49 <ibid> i still prefer my solution :)
12:12:54 <tic> it's got its qualities. :)
12:12:56 <ibid> i think it's close to optimum
12:13:04 <Darius> set xs i n = let (lo,_:hi) = splitAt xs i in lo++n:hi
12:13:25 <tic> prolly. splitAt would still need to traverse the list, so the time complexity would probably be the same.
12:13:34 <ibid> CosmicRay: hoh, and it contains also a "preview disk: free stargate atlantis episode, not for resale" :)
12:13:42 <CosmicRay> nice
12:13:52 <Darius> tic: There's no way to make the function that doesn't traverse the list.
12:13:57 <ibid> tic: and then you need to knit it together, and that'll copy it
12:13:59 <shapr> CosmicRay: I really like "The Accumulating Argument"
12:14:06 <Darius> tic: That's why people are suggesting other data types.
12:14:19 <CosmicRay> shapr: as a name for the sequence?
12:14:21 <shapr> yup
12:14:24 <tic> Darius, indeed.
12:14:30 <CosmicRay> hmm, did I miss that in a comment somewhere?
12:14:38 <tic> Darius, I understand you always need to traverse the list.
12:14:44 <shapr> It's a recent comment on the poll.
12:14:54 <CosmicRay> ah
12:15:18 <ibid> argh, and it has a *long* introductory sequence!
12:15:42 <CosmicRay> heh
12:15:49 <CosmicRay> what, atlantis/
12:15:56 <ibid> no, the regular disk
12:15:57 <CosmicRay> s,/,?,
12:15:59 <CosmicRay> a
12:16:06 <ibid> including an atlantis ad
12:16:14 <ibid> several minutes long :(
12:16:22 <ibid> the whole intro that is, including the ad
12:16:31 <CosmicRay> dammit this looks too damn cool http://techdatapros.com/asterisk/ ... I feel some money whistling out of my pocket...
12:16:39 <ibid> what's the accumulating argument?
12:17:53 <ibid> fortunately, the disk menu button overrides it!
12:19:07 <ibid> (and there's even finnish subtitles!)
12:19:26 <CosmicRay> shapr: what do you think, should I post a second poll?
12:19:37 <CosmicRay> shapr: syntaxninja also had a good suggestion that got missed
12:19:47 <ibid> CosmicRay: what are you talking about? :)
12:20:00 <CosmicRay> ibid: the what to name this site poll on sequence.complete.org
12:20:10 <ibid> ah
12:20:24 <ibid> (wow, the *only* subtitles are english and finnish. i'm impressed.)
12:20:52 <ibid> (apparently i'm not the only one who's ahead the finnish broadcast:)
12:21:15 <CosmicRay> ok, that's just *wrong*.
12:21:37 <CosmicRay> they get a season of stargate out in R2 -- with finnish subtitles no less -- before they get an english version out in R1?
12:21:38 <CosmicRay> argh.
12:21:46 <CosmicRay> wtf is scifi smoking
12:25:13 <ibid> argh, too many sites
12:25:29 <ibid> a planet haskell i might manage
12:30:19 <CosmicRay> ibid: sequence.complete.org has that, such as it is, in the offsite blogs block on the right
12:30:33 <CosmicRay> ibid: not enough haskellers are blogging to make a full Planet installation make much sense
12:30:40 <ibid> hm
12:31:01 <ibid> who are watched?
12:31:20 <CosmicRay> shapr, syntax, me, lambda the ultimate, hmm
12:31:29 <ibid> who's hmm?
12:31:30 <ibid> :)
12:31:52 <CosmicRay> http://sequence.complete.org/aggregator/sources
12:31:57 <CosmicRay> there
12:31:58 <CosmicRay> that was me trying to remember if there were others.
12:31:59 <CosmicRay> nope.
12:32:00 <CosmicRay> :-)
12:32:17 * ibid does not blog about haskell often
12:32:18 <CosmicRay> the offsite discussion is haskell-cafe, haskell, libraries, and glasgow-users
12:32:18 <ibid> but... :)
12:32:25 <CosmicRay> feed url? :-)
12:32:42 <CosmicRay> ibid: that's OK, I don't either :-)
12:33:22 <ibid> i suppose you want the english-only feed? :)
12:33:35 <CosmicRay> probably, but whatever you feel like
12:33:39 <ibid> or do you want me to create a haskell category?
12:34:21 <ibid> http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.info/blog/en?flav=rss
12:34:21 <CosmicRay> nah, part of the fun of it is to see what the haskell folks are thinking about
12:34:24 <CosmicRay> even if it's not haskell
12:34:31 <ibid> that's the all-english feed
12:36:36 <CosmicRay> ibid: http://sequence.complete.org/aggregator/sources/10
12:37:01 <CosmicRay> ibid: oh, and you will probably be jealous that I have built hugs for my PDA :-)
12:37:14 <ibid> heh
12:37:28 <Heffalump> nice.
12:37:29 <Pistos> SyntaxNinja ... nice name.  :)
12:37:42 <Heffalump> is that a Zaurus?
12:37:47 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: indeed it is
12:37:49 * pesco 's eyes spew angry flames of envy at CosmicRay.
12:37:54 <CosmicRay> hehe
12:38:06 <pesco> :)
12:38:13 <CosmicRay> I posted a URL to the ipk I built on -cafe around christmas, if memory serves
12:38:24 <Heffalump> did you get anywhere with ghc?
12:38:37 <ibid> i did consider trying to build nhc
12:38:37 <pesco> Damn, this makes me _want_ one of those gadgets.
12:38:42 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: not really, I never really tried starting.
12:39:00 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: something freaky about floating point on arm  is the blocker, iirc
12:39:11 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: which means it's probably beyond my skill to fix.
12:39:16 <Heffalump> I read that thread, but I didn't quite understand the issue.
12:39:36 <CosmicRay> yeah, me neither
12:39:39 <pesco> Are there any other Linux-based PDA's out there currently? I've not been keeping up.
12:39:40 <ibid> arm fp is fun, yeah
12:39:43 <CosmicRay> I think igloo is probably tired of explaining it to me
12:39:51 <ibid> pesco: other than...?
12:39:55 <CosmicRay> pesco: you can also put linux on many ipaqs
12:40:00 <ibid> ah, sorry, read wrong
12:40:02 <Heffalump> ibid: in what way?
12:40:03 <CosmicRay> pesco: it will be running essentially the same software as openzaurus
12:40:06 <Igloo> AFAIK you just need a special case for float/double -> bits and/or vice-cersa
12:40:11 <SyntaxNinja> hi all
12:40:13 <SyntaxNinja> thanks pistos
12:40:16 <pesco> CosmicRay: Aha.
12:40:19 <Heffalump> igloo: oh, right.
12:40:19 <ibid> Heffalump: istr it's soft
12:40:22 <Pistos> Mathetes: Who is SyntaxNinja?
12:40:26 <Heffalump> ibid: depends on the unit
12:40:29 <Mathetes> Pistos: Monolingual is no fun.
12:40:33 <ibid> Heffalump: yeah
12:40:34 <CosmicRay> pesco: openzaurus being the most popular of the several custom linux distributions for the zaurus
12:40:36 <Heffalump> igloo: I thought it was standard IEEE
12:40:41 <Heffalump> unless you're using the runfast mode
12:40:44 <CosmicRay> pesco: though for the ultimate flexibility, you still want a zaurus
12:40:54 <ibid> standard ieee is rather loose :)
12:40:58 <Heffalump> but even then it's standard representation, just not IEEE conformant in results
12:40:59 <CosmicRay> pesco: there are at least half a dozen actively maintained distributions for it
12:41:05 <pesco> CosmicRay: Cool.
12:41:06 <SyntaxNinja> Pistos: why are you asking Mathetes
12:41:09 <CosmicRay> pesco: plus the 640x480 hi-res screen kicks ass
12:41:15 * pesco drools.
12:41:18 <CosmicRay> pesco: the same physical size as the 320x240 screens in the ipaq
12:41:24 * Heffalump really ought to be in a position to help with this, but I suspect I'm actually not.
12:41:28 <Pistos> SyntaxNinja: Just trying to subtly advertise his abilities...
12:41:34 <Heffalump> (I've worked in ARM's compiler group since November)
12:41:42 <Pistos> !locate SyntaxNinja
12:41:43 <Mathetes> Searching for SyntaxNinja ...
12:41:43 <CosmicRay> pesco: http://quux.org/Computers/Sharp%20Zaurus%20c760
12:41:50 <SyntaxNinja> oh, we have a new bot?
12:41:51 <Mathetes> I estimate that SyntaxNinja is somewhere in UNITED STATES.
12:41:56 <ibid> Mathetes: who are you? :)
12:42:00 <Mathetes> ibid: I am Mathetes the cyberconversationalist.
12:42:00 <Pistos> SyntaxNinja: Something like that.  :)
12:42:11 <Pistos> Aha!  He's passed the Turing Test already.  Everyone thought he was a human lurker.
12:42:13 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: nah, just a failing scheme to convince pistos to use haskell and open the source code to his bot :-)
12:42:23 <ibid> Mathetes: have you read the cyberiad?
12:42:29 <Mathetes> ibid: I like to study, meditate on and contemplate the Bible.
12:42:30 <Igloo> http://musketeer.comlab.ox.ac.uk/~igloo/f.c gave different results to x86 and sparc (which gave the reverse of each other)
12:42:31 <tic> Hrm, this doesn't quite seem to work: replace xs i n = let f j c = if j == i then n else c in map f (zip [1..] xs)
12:42:37 <ibid> Mathetes: so, no?
12:42:50 <Mathetes> ibid: Okelie dokelie.
12:43:07 <Igloo> I doubt it's actually very hard, but time consuming enough I'm not very motivated to do it given the arm guys plan to fix it anyway
12:43:19 <Heffalump> the arm guys?
12:43:20 <CosmicRay> pesco: use http://quux.org/Computers/Sharp%20Zaurus%20c760/index.html rather
12:43:43 <CosmicRay> pesco: you will probably enjoy the screenshot of Super Mario World running under snes9x :-)
12:43:58 <pesco> Ooh!
12:44:07 <Igloo> The arm Linux gcc etc guys
12:44:23 <CosmicRay> pesco: I never got around to posting gaim screenshots, alas, but it does work.
12:44:52 <CosmicRay> pesco: there is a debian-in-a-chroot distribution that gives you a full X console running Debian, togglable with the regular PDA environment
12:45:03 <CosmicRay> pesco: the pdaxrom.org people also have a complete X-based PDA distribution all their own
12:45:19 <CosmicRay> so there's a fair bit of choice out there :-)
12:45:32 <CosmicRay> yes, I have emacs working on my pda too :-)
12:46:25 <Heffalump> they are going to fix gcc to produce the right result?
12:46:37 <CosmicRay> I don't know
12:46:55 <Igloo> That's what I was told
12:49:55 <ibid> argh, why isn't a dash allowed in a user name? :/
12:50:31 <Heffalump> what kind of username?
12:50:43 <ibid> at the haskell sequence
12:52:13 <Heffalump> ah
12:52:39 <ibid> hoh, amazon promotes a book to me in an email basd on an earlier purhcase, and says, among other things:
12:52:42 <ibid> "You are 6,668 times more likely to purchase this item than other customers."
12:52:58 <Darius> ibid: Which book?
12:53:16 <ibid> How to Write a Damn Good Novel
12:53:30 <ibid> Because you purchased or rated:
12:53:33 <ibid>         * How to Write a Damn Good Novel, II
12:53:59 <SyntaxNinja> ibid: you'd better go buy it
12:54:24 <ibid> oh?
12:59:47 <ibid> hehe:
12:59:48 <ibid> Member for:
12:59:49 <ibid> 4 sec
13:05:58 <Pirate> is there a built in bool operator in haskell for if a then b else True?
13:06:39 <CosmicRay> not afaik
13:07:15 <CosmicRay> you could approximate it yourself though
13:07:33 <tic> How do I create an Int from an Integer in GHC?
13:07:33 <Pirate> yeah i know, i was just wondering if there was already one built in before i did
13:07:40 <Heffalump> fromInteger
13:07:43 <CosmicRay> let (?) b (t:f) = if b then t else f
13:07:50 <CosmicRay> True ? (1, 2)
13:07:53 <CosmicRay> would return
13:07:54 <CosmicRay> 1
13:08:10 <Heffalump> CosmicRay: huh?
13:08:13 <Heffalump> that's not type correct
13:08:14 <tic> Heffalump, thanks!
13:08:27 <CosmicRay> err
13:08:28 <CosmicRay> (t, f)
13:08:47 <Heffalump> ah, ok. But what does that have to do with Pirate's question?
13:08:59 <CosmicRay> it was a way to implement what he was asking for.
13:09:09 <CosmicRay> Prelude> let (?) b (t, f) = if b then t else f
13:09:11 <CosmicRay> Prelude> True ? (1, 2)
13:09:18 <CosmicRay> Prelude> :t (?)
13:09:18 <CosmicRay> (?) :: forall t. Bool -> (t, t) -> t
13:09:18 <pesco> No, he was asking for a _boolean_ operator.
13:10:10 <CosmicRay> ah, indeed I misread.  I thought he was looking for the equivolent of ? : in C
13:10:26 <vegai> I overheard a rumour that a "Twisted Haskell" has been mentoined
13:10:42 <mich4545-> how is this bad syntax :      s = (n/d) - (1/f)   (Syntax error in input (unexpected `='))  ?
13:11:09 <Darius> Depends on whether you are trying to put that in the repl and/or what's around it.
13:11:19 <mich4545-> inside a where clause
13:11:20 * boegel greets again
13:11:21 <pesco> t f f / t t t / f t t / f f t  What is that operation called?
13:11:25 <mich4545-> hi boegel
13:11:30 <boegel> hi mich4545-
13:11:56 <boegel> pesco: XOR?
13:12:03 <pesco> No.
13:12:05 <boegel> no, sorry
13:12:26 <CosmicRay> no, not quite xor

13:12:39 <boegel> implication
13:12:55 <boegel> f => _ = True
13:12:58 <mich4545-> is it possible to make 1/3 appear in haskell and not calculate div 1 3 instead
13:12:58 <boegel> t => f = False
13:13:04 <boegel> t => t = True
13:13:15 <Heffalump> div 1 3 isn't actually 1/3, as an aside
13:13:19 <Heffalump> they have different types
13:13:20 <pesco> Of course.
13:13:25 <Heffalump> and what do you mean by "appear"
13:13:26 <Heffalump> ?
13:13:48 <boegel> mich4545-: show 1 ++ "\" ++ show 3
13:13:48 <boegel> ?
13:13:53 <mich4545-> for example calculate 1/3 - 1/4 have the answer appear as a n/d form
13:14:13 <boegel> appeared as output ?
13:14:15 <mich4545-> boegel, but I have to actually use these to get a result
13:14:18 <mich4545-> yes
13:14:31 <Heffalump> use the Ratio class
13:14:41 <Heffalump> s/class/type/
13:14:42 <Mathetes> <Heffalump> use the Ratio type
13:14:53 <ibid> wow
13:15:03 <Heffalump> oh dear.
13:15:08 <pesco> Mathetes, are you trying to imply we can't read sed ourself
13:15:13 <Mathetes> pesco: Good heavens, no!
13:15:23 <pesco> s/self/selves?/
13:15:24 <Mathetes> <pesco> Mathetes, are you trying to imply we can't read sed ourselves
13:15:27 <ibid> s/trying/done/
13:15:32 <pesco> Mathetes: I certainly hope so.
13:15:36 <ibid> nice
13:15:42 <CosmicRay> Mathetes: you rule.
13:15:42 <ibid> s/nice/Nice./
13:15:42 <Mathetes> pesco: Do you have the impression that this conversation has turned a bit one-sided?
13:15:43 <Mathetes> <ibid> Nice
13:15:45 <CosmicRay> s/rule/suck/
13:15:46 <Mathetes> CosmicRay: What use is a democracy if the majority is wrong?
13:15:48 <Mathetes> <CosmicRay> Mathetes: you suck.
13:16:07 <CosmicRay> rats. :-)
13:16:19 <mich4545-> how to you use the Ratio class to implement this
13:16:19 <X-Scale> Mathetes: dumbocracy ?
13:16:27 <Mathetes> X-Scale: I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
13:16:28 <Pistos> X-Scale: Heh.
13:16:34 <Heffalump> Prelude Ratio> 1/3 - 1/4 :: Ratio Int
13:16:34 <Heffalump> 1 % 12
13:16:49 <mich4545-> %  ?
13:16:55 <Heffalump> just means / really.
13:17:06 <mich4545-> cant it be / instead
13:17:18 <CosmicRay> mich4545-: it's pretty trivial to replace the % in a string with a /.
13:17:22 <ibid> write your own shower

13:17:39 <pesco> ibid: Nice idea!
13:17:48 <ibid> pesco: hm?

13:19:17 <Pistos> No, it just has limited functionality.  :P
13:19:40 <Heffalump> no, it's broken. s/o/p/2 on 'food' should not result in 'fppd'
13:19:54 <Heffalump> :-p
13:19:56 <Pistos> It's not supposed to be a fully sed.  :P
13:20:03 <Pistos> -y

13:34:37 <ibid> wow
13:35:41 <vegai> now, all we need is an irc that allows you to change what anyone said before
13:36:35 <pesco> Yeah! Collaborative sed frenzy.
13:36:51 * pesco starts an implementation.
13:36:58 <Pistos> Heh.
13:37:11 <Pistos> You freaks!  :)
13:37:57 <vegai> you could call it "Big Brother"
13:38:34 <mauke> huhu
13:38:38 <mich4545-> how do you implement this ,   1/3 - 1/4 :: Ratio Int     into a function so that when I give n/d - n/d I get an output resulting n/d aswell and not an integer or float ?

13:43:52 <mauke> hahaha
13:43:58 <pesco> I can see the headlines again. "Today, taking the stage at the twothird-pi'th Internetional Symposium on Computing Metaphors, #haskell chair of inarticulate developments, Shae Erisson, presented the latest version of his team's vi conferencing tool to the public. 'We are just now on the verge of creating a whole new shower of how we look at computers' he exclaimed excitedly."
13:44:26 <Heffalump> mich4545-: is this to help with homework type stuff, or just for general use?
13:44:26 * Darius hates when things use javascript instead of real links.
13:44:31 <SyntaxNinja> pesco: heh
13:44:44 <Pistos> And here are a pair of highly utile commands:
13:44:46 <Pistos> !feed apple
13:44:48 * Mathetes skewers the apple with a tethered harpoon, then reels it into a small hatch in his side.
13:44:49 * Mathetes stares at Pistos a little more hungrily...
13:44:55 <Pistos> !egg CosmicRay
13:44:56 * Mathetes retracts one of his fists into his sleeve.  A chain gun emerges in its place, which Mathetes aims at CosmicRay.  CosmicRay is riddled with dozens of tiny quail's eggs!
13:44:57 <SyntaxNinja> I've noticed that bots do really bad things to the signal-to-noise ratio of this channel
13:44:58 <SyntaxNinja> ;)
13:45:05 <Pistos> SyntaxNinja: Sorry.  :)
13:45:07 * Pistos cuts it out now.
13:45:13 <mich4545-> heffa it is for a courseowrk, I just cant figure out how to use the Ratio class in order to produce a n/d output
13:45:18 <vegai> !source
13:45:30 * vegai sulks.
13:45:33 <Pistos> vegai: :)
13:45:40 <Heffalump> it's not a class, it's a type
13:45:49 <SyntaxNinja> you could always run and play in #haskellbot or something
13:46:00 <Pistos> There's a haskellbot?
13:46:01 <Pistos> +#
13:46:07 <Heffalump> there can be..
13:46:07 <CosmicRay> no
13:46:11 <Pistos> Heh.
13:46:14 <CosmicRay> but you're just a /join away.
13:46:19 <Pistos> Well, Mathetes already has his own #mathetes ...
13:46:24 <CosmicRay> your bot has its own channel anyway... :-)
13:46:28 <ibid> let's make #haskell@OFTC the official haskell bot county :)
13:46:29 <Pistos> Well, I've stopped now anyway.  :)
13:46:45 * Igloo thinks that's the wrong way round  :-)
13:46:47 <mich4545-> how should I use this type inside a function
13:46:47 <CosmicRay> good.  now can we please go ahead with evangelizing haskell to you? :-)
13:46:58 <Pistos> :)
13:47:18 <Pistos> CosmicRay: I have a hard enough time convincing people about Ruby.  If I change one more time, people will think I'm too wishy washy.  :)
13:47:27 <Heffalump> mich4545-: pattern match on its constructor, I expect.
13:47:34 <Heffalump> the constructor appears to be called (%)
13:47:41 <Heffalump> so for example
13:47:45 <Heffalump> foo (n % d) = (n,d)
13:47:51 <CosmicRay> @type %
13:47:52 <lambdabot> bzzt
13:47:53 <CosmicRay> @type (%)
13:47:54 <lambdabot> bzzt
13:47:56 <Heffalump> it's an infix constructor
13:47:59 <CosmicRay> stupid lambdabot
13:48:02 <Heffalump> @type (Ratio.%)
13:48:03 <lambdabot> (Ratio.%) :: forall a. (Integral a) => a -> a -> GHC.Real.Ratio a
13:48:10 <ibid> Pistos: why change, just add one more tool to your toolbox :)
13:48:11 <pesco> Actually, the constructor is (:%) I believe.
13:48:24 <Pistos> ibid: We'll see. :)
13:48:28 <ibid> isn't it private to the module?
13:48:28 <CosmicRay> Prelude> :t (%)
13:48:29 <CosmicRay> (%) :: Integral a => a -> a -> Ratio a
13:48:29 <CosmicRay> Prelude> :t (:%)
13:48:29 <CosmicRay> (:%) :: Integral a => a -> a -> Ratio a
13:48:30 <Heffalump> oh, yes, sorry.
13:48:32 <CosmicRay> pesco: I don't see a difference
13:48:37 <Heffalump> foo (n :% d) = (n,d)
13:48:39 <vegai> no! You must use one language for *everything*!
13:48:44 * Pistos reads what he assumes is Haskell code ...
13:48:47 <Heffalump> you can't pattern match on something that isn't a constructor
13:48:57 <CosmicRay> Pistos: this is not necessarily exemplary Haskell code :-)
13:49:03 <Heffalump> I should have noticed that % couldn't be a constructor.
13:49:07 <Pistos> CosmicRay: :)  Duly noted.
13:49:10 <mich4545-> hmm
13:49:13 <CosmicRay> Pistos: http://www.isi.edu/%7Ehdaume/htut/
13:49:20 <mich4545-> what does it mean then
13:49:21 <pesco> CosmicRay: On the other hand, (%) takes care of reduction.
13:49:25 <CosmicRay> Pistos: what language did you use for mathetes?
13:49:30 <mauke> is there a split function with split ":" "a:b:c:" = ["a", "b", "c", ""] in the standard library?
13:49:31 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Ruby + XML + SQL.
13:49:38 <CosmicRay> ah right, ruby
13:49:53 <Pistos> Well, of course, running on an eggdrop, it's hard to avoid just even a tiny bit of Tcl.
13:49:59 <Pistos> But I minimized that with my Ruby eggdrop bridge...
13:50:01 * Heffalump looks around a bit and suspects that mich4545- has 11 hours and 10 minutes to finish this coursework :-)
13:50:08 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you may find this page interesting: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters14.html
13:50:24 <mauke> if not, is there an easy way to define it?
13:50:26 <CosmicRay> Pistos: it's about the HaXML Haskell library, which is neither dom nor sax...
13:50:34 <Pistos> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/ <-- Um... no HTML?
13:50:39 <mich4545-> quite a bit more than that but thanks for reminding me
13:50:41 <CosmicRay> Pistos: pdf only IIRC
13:50:44 * Pistos is a big anti-PDF-online person...
13:50:47 <Heffalump> mauke: map (:[])
13:50:55 <CosmicRay> Pistos: apt-get install xpdf and be happy :-)
13:51:01 <Pistos> I have a PDF reader,
13:51:04 <mich4545-> but the point is I just dont understand how to use an existing type inside one of my new functions I defined
13:51:08 <Heffalump> oh, no, sorry.
13:51:09 <Pistos> I just believe that PDF belongs outside the web.
13:51:10 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I understand what you're saying
13:51:13 * Pistos nods.
13:51:14 <Pistos> Thanks.  :)
13:51:17 * pesco performs the ritual of xpdf.
13:51:35 <mich4545-> to actually use part of this existing type inside a function
13:51:40 * Pistos cruises to the haskell.org homepage.
13:51:55 <Pistos> Mathetes: What is a monad?
13:51:59 <mauke> Heffalump: uh, that simply splits a string into its characters
13:52:04 <Mathetes> Pistos: A monad is a delayed computation: a lambda-expression in our case.
13:52:07 <Pistos> Ah.
13:52:14 <vegai> ehh
13:52:16 <Pistos> Mathetes: That clarifies things.  Thank you.
13:52:16 <Heffalump> mauke: yes, I realised what you were actually asking for afterwards, when I said "oh, no, sorry"
13:52:22 <Mathetes> Pistos: You're too kind.
13:52:31 <Darius> Pistos: YAHT is over a hundred pages.
13:52:36 <mauke> ah, yes :-)
13:52:45 <Heffalump> it's a fairly simple recursive definition, using break, if that helps.
13:52:55 <Heffalump> something like split [] = []
13:53:01 <Heffalump> sorry
13:53:04 <Heffalump> split c [] = []
13:53:09 <mauke> Heffalump: my current version is this: http://rafb.net/paste/results/JD6Zpq37.html
13:53:19 <mauke> but it doesn't handle trailing null fields correctly
13:53:22 <Pistos> Darius: Which makes it a perfect candidate for spreading out among leaves and branches in an HTML-based website, IMO...
13:53:58 <Pistos> Ah good... a Rationale.
13:54:08 * Pistos thinks almost everything in the world needs a [good] Rationale.
13:54:09 <Heffalump> split c xs = case break (==c) xs of
13:54:15 <Darius> Pistos: Given that it's mostly linear I'd find that either very annoying or well... I'd just find it very annoying.
13:54:15 * Pistos reads "Why Use Haskell?".
13:54:36 <Heffalump>          (ys,[]) -> [ys]
13:54:38 <Pistos> Darius: Well, it can't be hundreds of pages of a single linear thought/concept/idea, can it?
13:54:41 <mauke> Heffalump: I want c to be a string, not a character
13:54:48 <Heffalump> ah, ok
13:54:48 <CosmicRay> Pistos: are you reading this page:   http://www.haskell.org/aboutHaskell.html
13:54:50 <Pistos> Even if it were a handful of ideas, each 20 pages long... it would be probably okay...
13:54:54 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Yes.
13:55:00 <CosmicRay> Pistos: good.  it's a good page.
13:55:07 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Okay.
13:55:07 <Heffalump> I'm too lazy to help debug your current attempt then, sorry.
13:55:29 <Pistos> I have a big problem with "page edges" on my screen draw as if I were looking at real pieces of paper.
13:55:33 <Pistos> +n
13:55:41 <Pistos> Complete with headers, footers and page numbers.
13:55:43 <Pistos> Break me a give.
13:55:56 * vegai agrees with Pistos 
13:56:02 * Pistos nods.
13:56:02 <vegai> I'm unable to read PDFs from screen
13:56:10 <Pistos> Amen, brother!
13:56:14 <Pistos> CAN I GET A WITNESS!
13:56:17 <Pistos> :)
13:56:24 <vegai> I confess!
13:56:32 <vegai> ehh, wrong sketch
13:56:35 <Pistos> Heh.
13:57:29 <Pistos> Okay, I like the keywords "easier" and "cheaper" on this page.
13:57:30 * Pistos reads on.
13:58:19 <vegai> "Over 44% more glitter!"
13:58:52 <Pistos> Introducing... LITE!  I new way to spell light with 20% fewer letters!
14:01:07 <Pistos> SQL is considered functional?
14:01:11 * Pistos shifts his world view.
14:01:26 <ibid> sql is declarative
14:01:33 <ibid> i wouldn't call it functional
14:01:37 <Pistos> Okay.
14:02:01 <CosmicRay> I agree with ibid.
14:02:47 <Pistos> Okay, stuff like [y | y <- xs ... ] reminds me of math class...
14:02:59 <ibid> that's the point :)
14:03:01 <Pistos> "such that"  "for all in" ...
14:03:03 <Pistos> Heh.
14:03:05 * Pistos reads on.
14:03:18 * Pistos points out that he didn't exactly excel in math... :)
14:03:31 <ibid> tho list comprehensions aren't used that often in actual code
14:03:34 <CosmicRay> Pistos: think of describing an algorithm in English.  Then think of this as a slightly more compact way to do it.
14:03:38 <Pistos> Am I supposed to know the alt-numpad combinations for upside-down A to program in Haskell?  ;)
14:03:47 <CosmicRay> Pistos: nono, that is Perl :-)
14:03:54 <Pistos> :)
14:04:11 <CosmicRay> rumor has it that Perl is starting to use some characters not available on English keyboards
14:04:20 <ibid> Pistos: no, all syntax is ascii, tho unicode can theoretically be used in identifiers
14:04:58 <Pistos> UTF-8 identifiers, ha ha... interesting thought.  :)
14:05:15 <ibid> you can use UTF-32 if you like :)
14:05:21 <pesco> mauke: split c = map tail . groupBy (const (/=c)) . (c:)
14:05:26 <pesco> That's the closest I could get.
14:05:38 <pesco> s/closest/shortest/
14:05:40 <Mathetes> <pesco> That's the shortest I could get.
14:05:51 <Pistos> Okay, that quicksort example IS quite clear and concise, I must admit.
14:05:56 <pesco> Mathetes, that's annoying.
14:06:00 <Mathetes> pesco: We could all do with a little more patience.
14:06:07 <Heffalump> mauke: c is supposed to be a string, not a character
14:06:12 <Pistos> pesco: I can disable it, if you prefer...
14:06:35 <pesco> Pistos: I think disabling the sed thing would be good.
14:06:35 <Pistos> I am noting, however, that I only get complaints from programming language channels.  :)
14:06:38 * pesco looks around?
14:06:38 <CosmicRay> pistos: try this alternative implementation
14:06:40 <Pistos> pesco: k ...
14:06:41 <CosmicRay> myqsort [] = []
14:06:41 <CosmicRay> myqsort (x:xs) = myqsort elts_lt_x ++ [x] ++ myqsort elts_greq_x
14:06:41 <CosmicRay>                  where
14:06:41 <CosmicRay>                  elts_lt_x   = filter (< x) xs
14:06:41 <CosmicRay>                  elts_greq_x = filter (>= x) xs
14:06:50 <CosmicRay> Pistos: any clearer?
14:06:52 <Pistos> CosmicRay: That's a smidgen clearer...
14:06:59 * ddarius hates that example.
14:07:02 <CosmicRay> does the same thing
14:09:42 <mauke> Heffalump, pesco: my current split: http://rafb.net/paste/results/lhQymz87.html
14:10:06 <CosmicRay> Pistos: one other thing to note -- when it says that this qsort works on anything that can be compared using the greater-than and less-than operators...
14:10:16 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you can define support for that for your own data types.
14:10:23 <Pistos> CosmicRay: I see.
14:10:25 <Pistos> k
14:10:36 <CosmicRay> Pistos: similar to defining __cmp__ for a class in python, or some obscure 15 lines of code in Java, I'm sure :-)
14:10:36 <Pistos> Same deal in Ruby, and I think Python too.
14:10:53 <CosmicRay> actually, a very different deal in Haskell, but same result :-)
14:10:58 <Pistos> Okay, this is odd.
14:11:23 <Pistos> There are two emacs haskell modes, and a wxhaskell thing in Portage.... but not actual haskell to emerge?
14:11:25 * Pistos googles.
14:11:38 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you will want to emerge ghc6 and hugs, probably
14:11:45 <CosmicRay> Pistos: there are multiple haskell implementations
14:11:49 <Pistos> Oh, I see.
14:11:56 <CosmicRay> Pistos: ghc6 includes the GHC compiler and ghci interpreter
14:12:01 <CosmicRay> Pistos: hugs is an interpreter only
14:12:05 <pesco> mauke: Oh, you need strings as seperators, I see.
14:12:24 <CosmicRay> Pistos: haskell can be compiled to object code, to C code, or interpreted.
14:12:45 <Pistos> Hmm... What do you recommend?
14:12:46 <CosmicRay> well, to C code is of limited use
14:12:55 <CosmicRay> Pistos: go for ghc6 for now
14:12:56 <Pistos> Just to play around ith.
14:12:57 <Pistos> +w
14:12:59 <Pistos> k
14:13:18 <vegai> compiling ghc takes a while, btw
14:13:19 <CosmicRay> Pistos: hugs is small and easily portable, so it may compile faster for you, but ghci is nicer than hugs
14:13:30 <CosmicRay> hmm, I wonder how they compile ghc on gentoo
14:13:39 <CosmicRay> since they have no bootstrap binary
14:13:43 <vegai> using a binary package as a dependancy
14:13:53 <vegai> at least the last time I was there
14:13:56 <Igloo> They have a ghc-bin package or something IIRC
14:14:02 <vegai> yep
14:14:07 <CosmicRay> ah
14:14:50 <Pistos> Yes, it's emerging ghc-bin as a dependency as we speak.
14:14:59 <Pistos> <CosmicRay> Pistos: hugs is small and easily portable, so it may compile faster for you,
14:15:04 <Pistos> ^  Me?  Worried about compile time? :)
14:15:09 <CosmicRay> heh
14:15:13 <Pistos> Gentoo users are known to measure installs with days.  :)
14:15:19 <CosmicRay> heh
14:15:30 <CosmicRay> funny, that's how long it takes to get a working gcc on AIX :-)
14:15:51 <vegai> compiling ghc really can take a day
14:16:01 <CosmicRay> oh, sorry, that may imply that it's possible to get a fully-functional C compiler on that platform... :-)
14:16:03 <vegai> on modern hardware
14:16:14 <CosmicRay> vegai: I'd dispute that
14:16:25 <CosmicRay> vegai: it takes less than an hour on my $1k amd64 box
14:16:31 <dons> interesting - is there any other platform other than OpenBSD that does its ghc bootstrapping from .hc files?
14:16:35 <CosmicRay> which is not a high-end machine by any means
14:16:41 <Pistos> Do you guys know/use/like Darcs?
14:16:53 <Lemmih> yes/yes/yes.
14:16:54 <jlouis> They start by downloading a perl interpreter written in sh which they then execute the C interpreter written in perl with such that they can bootstrap binutils and gcc
14:17:04 <CosmicRay> Pistos: most of us know about it.  I use it when I'm working on a project that uses darcs.  I prefer arch for now but will likely switch to darcs at some point.
14:17:19 <CosmicRay> jlouis: who does that?
14:17:23 <CosmicRay> jlouis: that sounds evil
14:17:23 <dons> jlouis: ;)
14:17:26 <vegai> CosmicRay: whoa. I guess I'm not very hip
14:17:38 <jlouis> and the sh is built upon the forth bootloader embedded inside grub/whatever
14:17:42 <CosmicRay> heh
14:17:49 * Pistos is an svn user, himself...
14:17:55 <jlouis> which in turn is written by hand in x86 assembler
14:17:59 <ddarius> vegai: It took about 6hours thrashing away on a AMD K-6 400 with 64MB
14:17:59 <Pistos> I sorted briefly skimmed arch and Darcs webpages...
14:18:00 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I gave up on svn a couple of years ago
14:18:01 <jlouis> it is hard to bootstrap gentoo, yes
14:18:03 <Pistos> Nothing really caught my eye.
14:18:06 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Ah... why's that?
14:18:07 <ddarius> (at least 5.4 did)
14:18:13 <CosmicRay> Pistos: darcs and arch both are an improvement on it for a certain problem domain
14:18:28 <jlouis> CosmicRay: it is also a lie, but the compile times of Gentoo suggests a scheme like that ;)
14:18:31 <CosmicRay> Pistos: well, svn is great if you often need to look at history
14:18:36 <vegai> ddarius: interesting. I obviously had something wrong somewhere, then
14:18:37 <Pistos> I've never really had a big problem with Subversion, and find it easy, intuitive, fluid, quick...
14:18:44 <vegai> that happens with Gentoo easily...
14:18:46 <CosmicRay> Pistos: it is not so great if you have ad-hoc collaboration happening
14:18:57 <CosmicRay> Pistos: that is, someone sees a project, wants to fix some stuff in it, then is done
14:19:06 <CosmicRay> Pistos: with arch or darcs, branching can happen across repository lines
14:19:08 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Not something I've really encountered, since most of my usage of it is for < 5 users ...
14:19:20 <CosmicRay> Pistos: in fact, with both arch and darcs, the canonical setup is one user per repository
14:19:34 <CosmicRay> Pistos: this is great for free software projects developed online
14:19:38 <Pistos> CosmicRay: I see... sounds, as you said, like a different problem domain.
14:20:01 <CosmicRay> Pistos: now, having said that, while arch and darcs do support a full set of history commands, they are not as nice as subversion's and, in some cases, significantly slower
14:20:02 <Pistos> I suppose it would be a different beast if you have a lot of "one-shot" developers submitting patches or whatnot.
14:20:12 <CosmicRay> ie, "show me a diff from December to April" is slower in arch than svn.
14:20:14 <CosmicRay> significantly.
14:20:24 <Pistos> I think what turned me off was that I actually do want a central repository, not a decentralized scheme.
14:20:36 <CosmicRay> however, I find that I keep history for the rare occasion when I really need it.
14:20:48 <CosmicRay> that is still possible
14:20:53 <CosmicRay> with both arch and darcs
14:21:14 <CosmicRay> with darcs, every checkout creates a local repository, and "darcs push" becomes essentiall the same operation as "svn commit"
14:21:32 <CosmicRay> with arch, a centralized repository is done is basically the same way as with svn.
14:22:15 <CosmicRay> bonus: arch requires only a basic webserver on the server for read-only access, or scp for read-write access.  darcs requires only a basic webserver on the server for read-only, and ssh plus the darcs bin for read-write.
14:22:28 <CosmicRay> no mod_dav_svn or svnserve crap
14:22:54 <Pistos> "crap", heh.
14:23:01 <Pistos> Admittedly, it was a bit more challenging to get going than svnserve,
14:23:03 <Pistos> but I eventually did it,
14:23:09 <Pistos> and I wouldn't call it a big pain ...
14:23:43 <CosmicRay> it has gotten better
14:23:51 <CosmicRay> but if you're not running apache2 already and have limited IPs available
14:23:56 <CosmicRay> or limited RAM available
14:23:59 <CosmicRay> or are running *BSD
14:24:04 <CosmicRay> the pain could be big indeed :-)
14:24:07 <Pistos> :)
14:24:15 <Pistos> Yeah, my only experience was under Gentoo.
14:24:22 <CosmicRay> I found the the BSDs do not take kindly to trying to install two versions of apache at once.
14:24:34 <Pistos> And I just had to add a "-D DAV" flag to a config file somewher, and it just worked.  :)
14:24:47 <Pistos> That seems like asking for trouble on any OS/distro?
14:25:29 <vegai> Installing of apache? Yes.
14:25:37 <CosmicRay> heh
14:26:08 <CosmicRay> svn itself has quite the annoying dependencies itself:
14:26:12 <Pistos> Since we're exploring interests here, is anyone a fan of OSX?
14:26:18 <CosmicRay> $ ldd /usr/bin/svn | wc -l
14:26:18 <CosmicRay> 38
14:26:25 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I think it's a damn sight better than windows.
14:26:29 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I still prefer my debian, though.
14:26:38 <mattam> it could get better yet
14:26:44 <boegel> @seen shapr
14:26:45 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell.
14:26:49 <CosmicRay> $ ldd /usr/bin/darcs | wc -l
14:26:49 <CosmicRay> 13
14:26:49 * Pistos couldn't get over the troubles he had mixing stable,testing and unstable.
14:26:51 <CosmicRay>  ldd /usr/bin/tla | wc -l
14:26:52 <CosmicRay> 10
14:26:54 <boegel> shapr: are you active ?
14:26:58 <Pistos> I think if I didn't have those troubles, I'd still be a Debian user.
14:27:01 <CosmicRay> Pistos: just use testing and be happy
14:27:07 <CosmicRay> Pistos: why were you trying to mix all of that?
14:27:17 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Mostly out of noobness and ignorance, really.  :)
14:27:26 <Pistos> But it's true: I mostly want stable copies of things,
14:27:34 <CosmicRay> Pistos: ahh, well in that case I submit that your hatred of Debian stems from ignorance :-)
14:27:39 <Pistos> but want the freedom to venture into the cutting edge for a select few packages.
14:27:43 <CosmicRay> Pistos: sure, everybody does, but how stable?
14:27:54 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I think you'll find that testing is approximately the same degree of stableness as gentoo
14:27:59 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Well, let's say, not "so stable" as to have a 2.2 kernel, heh.
14:28:05 <CosmicRay> Pistos: heh
14:28:16 <Pistos> I dunno, it's too late now,
14:28:18 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I agree our release cycles suck
14:28:23 <Pistos> I'm in a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality with Gentoo.
14:28:38 <mattam> gentoo is quite the opposite indeed
14:28:39 <CosmicRay> Pistos: oh, and if you like gentoo's installer, you may enjoy my Debian From Scratch installer.  http://people.debian.org/~jgoerzen/dfs
14:28:57 <Pistos> If I'm gonna switch to anything, it'll be OSX, but not until OSX+Mac enters the same price arena as PC+Linux.  :)
14:29:05 <CosmicRay> it's written in ocaml, another functional language similar to haskell, but which I learned before I knew haskell existed
14:29:21 * Pistos has heard of OCaml, but... knows very little about it.
14:29:25 <CosmicRay> Pistos: which will be approximately 2073 :-)
14:29:30 <samc_> Pistos, ah never then
14:29:42 <mattam> price is part of the success
14:29:50 <CosmicRay> Pistos: ocaml is functional, very fast, but with a somewhat dated syntax and lacking the laziness and typeclasses that you find in haskell
14:29:59 <CosmicRay> Pistos: ocaml is also a functional/imperative hybrid language
14:30:11 <mattam> dated ?
14:30:13 <CosmicRay> Pistos: so it lacks the purity of haskell
14:30:24 <CosmicRay> mattam: yeah, I'd say that.
14:30:31 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Ah.  Well, I always value the virginity of my programming languages.
14:30:41 <mattam> what's a dated syntax anyway ?
14:30:46 <CosmicRay> mattam: although the camlp4o (or is it camlp4r?) does some to help with that
14:31:07 <mattam> camlp4
14:31:18 <CosmicRay> mattam: I'd say a syntax designed for ease of the parser rather than ease of the programmer
14:31:22 <mattam> o/r/... variants preloads some modules
14:31:24 <boegel> grr, the screen of my laptop keeps blacking out when I'm not doing anything for 5 seconds or so.... does anybody know how to fix it ?
14:31:28 <CosmicRay> mattam: I'm referring specifically to the "reformed" syntax
14:31:36 <CosmicRay> mattam: right, it has two different caml parsers
14:31:39 <mattam> oh
14:31:46 <mattam> nobody use it
14:31:53 <CosmicRay> I know, but it sucks less :-)
14:32:03 <mattam> except daniel...
14:32:25 <CosmicRay> Pistos: anyway, ocaml's main claim to fame is that it can outperform g++ and sometimes even gcc
14:32:29 <mattam> really ? you prefer having brackets around match with... ?
14:32:48 <CosmicRay> Pistos: however it lacks a lot of the extra flexibility that you get with haskell
14:33:08 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Interesting.  Not that I'm tremendously interested in speed, with my last three "favourite" languages being Java, Perl and Ruby.  :)
14:33:10 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I find haskell to be an about average performer, probably slightly better than the python/perl crowd
14:33:13 <tuomov> unstable is stable.
14:33:23 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you'll find haskell to be just fine then, I think
14:33:29 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Yes, probably.
14:33:30 <mattam> it should be mentioned that ocaml has a class system to overcome the modules shortcomings (IOW for late binding)
14:33:34 <Pistos> I can't think of a language I had a problem about speed with.
14:33:34 <tuomov> I've had very few problems with it. I had more problems with testing at the time I used it.
14:33:39 <Pistos> To me, speed of coding is much more important.
14:34:02 <tuomov> (One dependency has not been upgraded -> packages depending on it are removed etc.)
14:34:03 <Pistos> I mean, it's not like I program games or ray tracing or fractal calculation, or something...
14:34:29 <mattam> ocaml is very good at LoC too...
14:34:59 <CosmicRay> Pistos: it's quite faster than java to me.  but then you're used to that, with perl and ruby :-)
14:35:01 <CosmicRay> Pistos: right, I understand
14:35:05 <Pistos> :)
14:35:10 <CosmicRay> Pistos: your demands are similar to mine probably
14:35:18 <CosmicRay> mattam: yes, but not as good as haskell
14:35:22 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Which is scary, as it may mean that I may gravitate to Haskell.  :)
14:35:27 <CosmicRay> mattam: especially when it comes to I/O or arithmetic
14:35:56 <CosmicRay> ocaml I/O absolutely sucks big-time
14:36:11 <CosmicRay> there is no way in the standard ocaml library to open a file read/write.
14:36:14 <mattam> i don't think so... what are your griefs
14:36:19 <CosmicRay> that's #1
14:36:28 * Pistos peripherally points out that ghc is still compiling ...
14:36:31 <Pistos> 1.7 GHz machine...
14:36:47 <CosmicRay> my arithmetic complaint is that there are separate operators for floats as opposed to ints, and none of them can be extended to support custom types.
14:36:54 <shapr> pesco: I really like the idea of being #haskell chair of inarticulate developments.
14:36:56 <CosmicRay> whereas haskell's typeclass system solves that entire problem beautifully.
14:37:01 <Pistos> I'm leaving for home in 5 minutes so... hopefully it'll be done by the time I get back in the morning.  :)
14:37:03 <CosmicRay> shapr: <grin>
14:37:04 <mattam> that's right
14:37:11 <CosmicRay> Pistos: what tz are you in?
14:37:21 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you may find this interesting: http://www.quux.org/devel/missingh/html/index.html
14:37:25 <Pistos> CosmicRay: EST
14:37:29 <CosmicRay> Pistos: it's one of the two libraries I have built for Haskell
14:37:30 <mattam> but i never encountered a problem where it made a real difference
14:37:41 <shapr> pesco: A whole new shower of how we look at computers does fit my philosophy. How'd you come up with that?
14:37:46 <Pistos> Something that really perked my interest about Erlang was its boast about being able to modify code while it's running.
14:37:53 <Pistos> I think that is quite neat, and could be very useful.  :)
14:37:56 <CosmicRay> mattam: the lack of read/write support has screwed me multiple times
14:38:18 <shapr> Pistos: that's getting closer in the Haskell world.
14:38:32 <CosmicRay> Pistos: this is not all that far off in Haskell, and in certain limited senses of it, already exists
14:38:43 <pesco> shapr: I think ibid suggested rewriting ones shower (in case it was unsatisfactory I suppose) earlier.
14:38:45 <Pistos> .... o_O Gopher!?
14:38:49 <CosmicRay> you just have to plan ahead for the capability :-)
14:38:59 <CosmicRay> Pistos: <grin>
14:39:05 <Pistos> CosmicRay: :)
14:39:08 <mattam> Unix.open_file ".." 0_RDWR 0o644 ?
14:39:11 * Pistos hasn't seen Gopher since.. .OS/2.
14:39:12 <CosmicRay> Pistos: you are chatting with the current maintainer of the UMN gopher tree and the author of PyGopherd :-)
14:39:27 <CosmicRay> which I plan to port to Haskell whenever I get the time, incidentally
14:39:35 <CosmicRay> that's why I wrote HVFS and HVIO to start with
14:39:42 <Pistos> CosmicRay: You've quite the storied past, don't you?  :)
14:39:54 <Pistos> How many children?  ;)
14:40:02 <CosmicRay> HVFS and HVIO are, BTW, virtualizations to let you express many kinds of data structures as a filesystem...  the FTP server in MissingH can then serve them up as FTP, for instance
14:40:03 <Pistos> s/ch/grandch/
14:40:03 <CosmicRay> hehe
14:40:20 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I was about 12 when UMN abandoned gopher
14:40:33 <CosmicRay> Pistos: I think my interests move back one year for every year I age
14:40:34 <Pistos> CosmicRay: Do you have an advogato page?
14:40:42 <pesco> Behold!
14:40:44 <pesco> shapr: I hereby proclaim you the Chair of Inarticulate Developments!
14:40:47 <CosmicRay> Pistos: no.  why bother.  I run a gopher server. :-)
14:40:50 <Pistos> :)
14:40:50 <Pistos> Heh.
14:41:01 <Pistos> Okay, my day is done.
14:41:05 <Pistos> I'll be back tonight/tomorrow.
14:41:05 * Pistos waves.
14:41:06 <CosmicRay> Pistos: incidentally, PyGopherd seamlessly serves up gopher space to any WAP-enabled phone.
14:41:31 <CosmicRay> cya pistos
14:41:52 <CosmicRay> bwahahaha.
14:42:08 <CosmicRay> I have discovered the easiest way to get a better AI bot for this channel.
14:42:18 <CosmicRay> show the authors of AI bots how cool Haskell is :-)
14:42:32 <CosmicRay> hell of a lot easier than writing one myself :-)
14:43:35 <pesco> I find his comment about fear of seeming wishy washy to fellow programmers interesting.
14:43:45 <samc_> but then you might get an annoying evangelical bot
14:43:47 <CosmicRay> I must have missed that
14:44:04 <CosmicRay> samc_: well, it wouldn't be nearly as annoying if pistos stopped showing it off all the time :-)
14:44:36 <CosmicRay> yes, that bot's character is... uhm.... baptist.
14:44:38 <pesco> I think he said he'd rather not start advocating Haskell to them for they might perceive him as "wishy washy" since he had only recently started preaching another 'new' language.
14:44:48 <CosmicRay> bah.
14:44:55 <mattam> hehe
14:44:58 <CosmicRay> there is no shame in discovering something better.
14:45:05 <CosmicRay> that happened to me not long after I had adopted ocaml.
14:45:07 <pesco> Obviously not.
14:46:30 <pesco> But I can only confirm the walls of suspicion any unfamiliar idea seems to erect around other peoples' minds.
14:46:59 <pesco> But everyone knows that.
14:47:14 <CosmicRay> I know that happens, but I don't understand it.
14:47:15 <mattam> not 'other people' i guess
14:47:19 <CosmicRay> I like unfamiliar ideas.
14:47:24 <CosmicRay> familiar ideas are boring.
14:47:36 <mattam> and reconforting
14:48:06 <samc_> i have never heard of this reconforting word it must be crap
14:48:10 <mattam> or is it conforting in english ?
14:48:22 <CosmicRay> I dunno.  if I am not seeing much new to do with a language, then I think that it may be dead-end
14:48:27 <CosmicRay> I think you mean "comforting"
14:48:42 <samc_> (that was a joke btw)
14:48:57 <CosmicRay> heh
14:49:01 <mattam> webster says comforting.
14:49:20 <mattam> thanks CosmicRay
14:49:52 <CosmicRay> python seems dead to me.  the twisted people are doing some cool stuff, but I agree with shapr that many recent changes have been regressions
14:50:06 <samc_> don't forget Dijkstra's advice of not confusing convention with convenience
14:51:07 <CosmicRay> you know, Perl's motto is "there's more than one way to do it."  Python's is "there's one good way to do it."  I think Haskell's should be "there's more than one easy and clear way to do it."
14:51:14 <shapr> hey CosmicRay, we never talked about gnu free and dfsg free
14:51:21 <pesco> So back to this wishy washy thing. Is it the suspicion about "uncomforting" new programming languages that breeds the thought of their proclamator being wishy washy?
14:51:37 <shapr> Haskell's motto is "we give you the tools, you make your own way to do it."
14:51:40 <CosmicRay> shapr: this is probably not a good time since I have to leave in 8 minutes and also haven't reviewed gnu's idea of free in quite some time, but sure :-)
14:51:53 <Philippa_> shapr: that's /lisp's/ motto. Ours involves static typing as well
14:52:09 <CosmicRay> pesco: I've never encountered this wishy-washy thing
14:52:24 <pesco> CosmicRay: Me neither, but I can very well imagine it.
14:52:25 <CosmicRay> pesco: A lot of the people I know are, like myself, fluent in and use multiple languages regularly and have no qualms about doing so
14:52:34 <shapr> I don't fear change.
14:52:52 <CosmicRay> many also are not hesitant to learn new languages if there is a clear advantage to doing so.
14:52:57 <mattam> that may be a common preconception
14:53:20 <CosmicRay> and a clear advantage to me can be as little as "this is very different from what I'm used to"
14:53:27 <Philippa_> CosmicRay: it'll be more prevalent in C++ and Java circles where there's One True Language
14:54:09 <tuomov> C++ and Java circles relatively less Real Programmers
14:54:30 <mattam> Real Programmers ?
14:54:42 <mattam> like they're virtual ?
14:54:56 <Philippa_> tuomov: many of the C++ coders would say that of Haskell coders, sadly
14:55:00 <mattam> (pun not intended...)
14:55:04 <tuomov> vs. programms who just do it for the living without any kind of passion
14:55:07 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: yeah but what One True Language C++ or Java programmers are worth hanging out with? :-)
14:55:07 <tuomov> +er
14:55:09 <Philippa_> (though very few of the C++ coders I consider clueful, surprise surprise)
14:55:32 <Philippa_> CosmicRay: remove the "out with" and you get a very large number indeed :-)
14:55:42 <CosmicRay> hehe
14:56:17 <CosmicRay> I have very little respect for most VB programmers and probably the majority of C++ and Java programmers
14:56:29 <CosmicRay> these are people with little imagination that are mostly cut-and-paste programmers
14:56:31 <mattam> i'd say there's industry and 'artisanat' (english word ?)
14:56:39 <CosmicRay> the people that think that "Teach yourself Java in 21 days" is a good book.
14:56:49 <CosmicRay> mattam: artist or artisan, perhaps?
14:56:56 <samc_> artistry?
14:56:56 <Philippa_> CosmicRay: You need 21 days?!
14:57:04 <CosmicRay> heh
14:57:06 <Philippa_> (3 hours, Java in a Nutshell, 'nuff said)
14:57:06 <pesco> heh
14:57:17 <mattam> something like that yes
14:57:19 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: hell it takes about that long just to figure out how to read frmo the keyboard :-)
14:57:30 <CosmicRay> all the buffered reader stream reader crap
14:57:37 <pesco> hahaha.
14:57:40 * araujo still thinks the best book to learn Java is "The C Programming Language" K&R 2nd
14:57:52 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: of course you need 21 days.  You have to learn about class loaders if you're going to integrate python into your jakarta app, don't you? :-)
14:57:57 <CosmicRay> araujo: grin
14:58:09 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: and what java programmer doesn't realize that need after 21 days? :-)
14:58:09 <araujo> heya CosmicRay 8)
14:59:24 <pesco> My favourite way of approaching Java programmers is "HEY, everything's an object."
14:59:32 * Philippa_ sniggers
14:59:32 <pesco> They never get it. ;)
14:59:38 <CosmicRay> heh
14:59:42 <Philippa_> yes, that's one of the biggest flaws in the language IMO
14:59:48 <samc_> I object
14:59:56 <CosmicRay> pesco: that sounds like a pickup like...  "Hey baby, woudl you like to implement my interface?"
14:59:59 <Philippa_> me Jane?
14:59:59 <pesco> Philippa_: Agreed.
15:00:00 <mattam> i was at Knuth's conference in Paris last Friday, this man wouldn't be respected by a single java programmer i know... that's the difference. Not to say knuth programs beautifully, but he's an artist
15:00:12 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: and the fact that it isn't true is an even larger flaw
15:00:13 <samc_> Phillipa, yes that was the spirit
15:00:30 <CosmicRay> at least in python, an int is a proper object these days
15:00:45 <Philippa_> CosmicRay: that was in fact what I meant. Were everything an object in Java, life would be easier
15:00:48 <CosmicRay> but in java we get the lovely array types, and then there are Array objects.
15:00:55 <araujo> mattam, i doubt he would take seriously what a java programmer thinks about him 8)
15:01:00 <CosmicRay> java just sucks in so many ways you're making me late :-)
15:01:02 <mattam> sure
15:01:44 <CosmicRay> I will be happy if I die despised by every Java and VB programmer.
15:01:45 <pesco> mattam: What did Knuth talk about?
15:01:47 <CosmicRay> Knuth should be happy.
15:01:54 <CosmicRay> anyway, cyall later.
15:02:04 <mattam> Oh and how do you like the dynamic type-checking at each object array update in Java ?
15:02:36 <mattam> lattices of trees. He described 3 of them with connexions and discussed with the public
15:03:01 <boegel> is anyone interested in a slideshow one of my colleagues gave today, on the subject of his thesis (using Haskell, like I do) ?
15:03:20 <pesco> boegel: What's the subject of his thesis?
15:03:30 <boegel> pesco: ask him :)
15:03:52 <shapr> hoi mitchkov
15:04:00 <mitchkov> hey shapr
15:04:06 <boegel> and there's shapr, just on time :)
15:04:11 <shapr> for what?
15:04:14 <araujo> haha
15:04:22 <araujo> shapr, your haskell tour 8)
15:04:25 <boegel> for mitchkov's presentation he gave today
15:04:28 <shapr> oh
15:04:29 <mattam> that's funny, he said it's very rare to have more than one lattice on a particular domain so he was very proud to present results that were already known in the 50's :)
15:04:30 <pesco> mattam: Why exactly do you say none of the Javas you know would respect Knuth?
15:04:34 <shapr> mitchkov: oh I wanna see!
15:04:45 <mattam> 'cause they don't know what he did!
15:05:10 <pesco> Ok.
15:05:37 <tuomov> I wouldn't exactly call TeX a well-designed language... :)
15:05:47 <mattam> and those who know find SWT sexier than MIX anyway.
15:05:51 <tuomov> but maybe he had other goals with the machines of that age
15:05:51 <mitchkov> kay shapr, moment plz
15:06:11 <zamez> am I a Java programmer if I use Jython?
15:06:28 <shapr> I dunno, I've used Jython a lot.
15:06:31 <pesco> zamez: Anything with a J in it, I'm afraid... ;)
15:06:35 <pesco> j/k
15:06:37 * zamez cries
15:07:59 <pesco> OK, I've had enough for today. I'm going for a scuttle.
15:08:05 <pesco> ;) See you all.
15:08:16 <boegel> pesco: you should wait
15:08:28 <pesco> boegel: Huh.
15:08:41 <shapr> A scuttle?
15:08:49 <boegel> pesco: to see mitchkov's presentation :)
15:08:53 <pesco> shapr: A random quote.
15:08:56 <shapr> ah
15:09:03 <pesco> boegel: Ok, ok.
15:09:06 <boegel> pesco: Functional implementation and formal verification of audiofilters
15:09:17 <mitchkov> shapr, here ya go: http://users.pandora.be/ibracke/AudiofilterEnglish.ppt
15:09:22 <pesco> Ah! Interesting indeed.
15:09:36 <pesco> WAAH, that dreaded format!
15:09:40 <pesco> "format"
15:09:49 <pesco> I'm sorry. I'm being impulsive.
15:09:49 <mitchkov> :)
15:09:55 <mitchkov> np pesco
15:10:00 <mattam> <promotion>use advi!</>
15:10:20 <shapr> Advil won't help my headache!
15:10:33 <pesco> mitchkov: I don't suppose you have a PDF version?
15:10:33 <zamez> it might be text/html with an extension to scare you :>
15:10:45 <mattam> :)
15:10:59 <boegel> pesco: I could make you one ?
15:11:10 <mitchkov> pesco, maybe i can use a converttool
15:11:12 <shapr> I can export to html slideshow with openoffice...
15:11:14 <zamez> googlebot doesn't even try to fetch URLs ending .zip
15:12:09 <mitchkov> boegel's converting it, moment plz :)
15:13:06 <shapr> This is perfect for arrows. You could do all sorts of nifty auto-optimization, partial evaluation, etc.
15:15:15 <shapr> Wasn't there someone building a toolkit for auto upsampling and stuff like that?
15:15:40 <shapr> I'm pretty sure I saw some discussion about some functional soundfile code on the mailing lists somewhere.
15:15:51 <boegel> here you go: studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/AudiofilterEnglish.pdf
15:16:22 <pesco> Ah, thanks!
15:16:31 <boegel> so how do you guys like it ? give the guy some feedback !
15:16:43 <boegel> (and then you can do the same thing with me next week :p)
15:16:47 <Itkovian> hi boegel
15:16:50 <Itkovian> woeking late?
15:16:52 <shapr> Looks like fun
15:16:53 <Itkovian> *working
15:16:55 <boegel> finally, the secrets of my raytracer revealed :p
15:17:01 <boegel> Itkovian: well, yeah
15:17:06 <Darius> boegel: How's it going by the way?
15:17:10 <Itkovian> join the club
15:17:10 <boegel> mitchkov: say hi to Itkovian :)
15:17:18 <shapr> This is a good opportunity for a combinator library.
15:17:24 <boegel> Darius: pretty good, I'm working on the theoretic part now
15:17:26 <Itkovian> wtf is mitchkov ?
15:17:40 <mitchkov> ooh hi Itkovian
15:17:55 <boegel> Itkovian: one of my colleagues, so be gentle, he knows you :p
15:18:13 <Itkovian> erm ... Arne?
15:18:39 <mitchkov> Bingo Itkovian !
15:18:53 <boegel> Itkovian: you know him ? :)
15:18:58 <Itkovian> there's too much text on yr presentation slides :-)
15:19:01 <boegel> or did you guess from his whois?
15:19:03 <Itkovian> boegel, nope.
15:19:11 <boegel> oh, the slides :)
15:19:16 <Itkovian> I guessed from a) yr webpage and b) his presence here
15:19:28 <boegel> oh, I see :
15:20:07 <mitchkov> Itkovian: too much text on presentation slides make them boring, my opinion
15:20:08 <boegel> Itkovian: besides the too much text part, how do you like the slides ?
15:20:24 <boegel> mitchkov: he's saying there _is_ too much text :)
15:20:46 <mitchkov> ah sorry, my mistake :)
15:22:59 * boegel would love to see more feedback :)
15:24:19 <Itkovian> boegel where are your slides?
15:24:48 <shapr> What sort of feedback do you want?
15:25:19 <shapr> I'd say, build a combinator lib, check the resampling emails I read some time ago, looks like a fun project.
15:25:51 <shapr> You may want to try to build the bitmap version of Haskore, assuming you think of Haskore as a vector tool.
15:25:51 <mitchkov> shapr: emails ?
15:25:55 <boegel> Itkovian: I don't have any yet, I'm due next week
15:26:14 <boegel> mitchkov: on the Haskell mailing list
15:26:33 <shapr> I'll see if I can find the emails.
15:27:02 <mitchkov> thx shapr
15:28:53 <shapr> Aha, I found 'em in my local curryspondence installation, lemme turn that into an url you can use.
15:30:38 <araujo> this just looks funny to me:
15:30:40 <araujo> Using the Microsoft HTML Help system provides two advantages over plain HTML: the help viewer gives you a nice hierarchical folding contents pane on the left, and the documentation files are compressed and therefore much smaller (roughly a factor of 10). The disadvantages are that the viewer is only available on Windows, and the help can't be viewed over the web.
15:30:54 <Itkovian> ic.
15:31:05 <Itkovian> well ... that very last statement makes a lot of sens *cough*
15:31:20 <araujo> hah
15:34:38 <shapr> mitchkov: Two threads to read - http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-November/007534.html http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-December/007822.html
15:35:23 <mitchkov> thx shapr!
15:37:33 <boegel> I'm out, hard day ahead of me tomorrow
15:38:00 <mitchkov> me too :)
15:38:15 <shapr> Three outs, time for the next inning.
15:39:14 <samc_> six balls gone time for the next over :p
15:39:28 <boegel> bye everyone
15:39:32 <Itkovian> night.
15:40:29 * samc_ should stop attempting humour
15:40:57 * shapr didn't get it
15:41:17 <samc_> that's one each then
15:41:24 <shapr> heh
15:41:24 <Heffalump> he was extolling the superiority of cricket over baseball
15:41:47 <shapr> ah, I see.
15:41:54 <samc_> it was a pathetic pun
15:42:11 <shapr> That's the best type.
15:44:07 * Itkovian knows next to nothing about cricket, only what tHHGttG tells him (which, after all, is more than enough)
15:44:15 * Remi thinks it's time to get some sleep
15:44:39 <Remi> goodnight
15:48:49 <int80_h> hello everybody
15:48:57 <int80_h> *hi doctor nick*
16:18:45 <SyntaxNinja> does anyone know offhand if I need QuickCheckM to test a function like "prop_foo :: Int -> IO Bool"
16:21:52 <Heffalump> I'd be very surprised if you didn't
16:28:46 <SyntaxNinja> well, QuickCheckM (so far) seems geared toward testing the state itself, I just want to test the return value
16:47:54 <ingy> hola
16:48:16 <SyntaxNinja> hi
16:48:34 <ingy> SyntaxNinja: can you look at some code for me?
16:50:17 <ingy> http://sial.org/pbot/7959
16:50:19 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: if it's not too long.
16:51:10 <SyntaxNinja> the type is wrong;
16:51:18 <ingy> should I get the error or is it obvious?
16:51:20 <SyntaxNinja> it should be :: a -> IO b
16:51:27 <SyntaxNinja> not IO a -> b
16:52:19 <ingy> I don't get it :\
16:53:35 <ingy> mm, maybe I get it now...
16:53:56 <SyntaxNinja> [(String, String)] -> IO [[VStr]]
16:54:38 <SyntaxNinja> because the monad marking (IO) is part of the return value, not the input value
16:55:04 <SyntaxNinja> also, you don't need to bind the libs thing and then return it at the bottom...
16:55:15 <ingy> ok
16:55:18 <SyntaxNinja> do a <- foo; a -- incorrect
16:55:22 <SyntaxNinja> you need to either:
16:55:24 <SyntaxNinja> do foo
16:55:25 <SyntaxNinja> or
16:55:29 <SyntaxNinja> do a <- foo; return a
16:56:12 <SyntaxNinja> @wiki ThatAnnoyingIoType
16:56:12 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThatAnnoyingIoType
16:56:17 <Heffalump> or 'foo' on its own
16:56:27 <SyntaxNinja> oh yeah
16:58:01 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: hacking on Pugs I take it? :)
16:58:15 <ingy> of course =)
16:58:45 <ingy> I need to get over the LambdaCamel hump
16:58:56 <ingy> so to speak
17:04:47 <SyntaxNinja> :)
17:11:39 <ingy> SyntaxNinja: http://sial.org/pbot/7960
17:11:44 <ingy> still don't get it
17:16:14 <SyntaxNinja> you need to extract the value out of the getLibs application
17:16:44 <SyntaxNinja> like "do l <- getLibs environ; incAV <- newMVal  $ VList (map VStr $ concat l)
17:16:44 <SyntaxNinja> "
17:16:50 <SyntaxNinja> did you read that link?
17:17:00 <SyntaxNinja> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThatAnnoyingIoType
17:19:27 <SyntaxNinja> actually, that page could really use a reorganization
17:20:35 <ingy> yeah, I don't seem to be grokking the essence
17:20:47 <ingy> at least not enough to fix my problem
17:21:51 * CosmicRay peers in to the inky blackness
17:22:31 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: this isn't a very easy topic. there are a lot of monad tutorials out there
17:22:38 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: got a favorite monad tutorial?
17:23:02 <CosmicRay> hmm, shapr posted about the best one recently on sequence... let me get a url...
17:23:26 <CosmicRay> I think it was this one:
17:23:30 <CosmicRay> http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/
17:31:57 <ingy> The tutorial looks cool, but i got it to work so i will likely read it later
17:32:11 <SyntaxNinja> heh
17:32:46 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: the basic issue is that for things in the IO monad, you need to sorta extract them with the "x <- y" syntax
17:33:06 <ingy> the problem was I couldn't call getLibs as an argument to concat
17:33:07 <SyntaxNinja> but using that syntax means that the surrounding code is in the IO monad
17:33:20 <ingy> I had to assign it to something else first
17:33:21 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: right. because concat takes a list, not an (IO list)
17:33:30 <ingy> :)
17:33:51 <SyntaxNinja> if b is (IO list), then "a <- b" makes a into a "list"
17:34:11 <ingy> *that's* what i needed to know :)
17:34:22 <ingy> you should put that on the wiki
17:34:49 <SyntaxNinja> ingy: but that's the secret knowledge that no one must learn
17:34:56 <ingy> ooooo
17:34:59 <ingy> I see
17:35:24 * ingy feels (very temporarily) In The Know
17:36:07 <SyntaxNinja> hehe
17:36:47 <SyntaxNinja> it's actually right at the top of that page I pasted
17:40:03 <ingy> yay, I'm getting it
17:40:09 <ingy> SyntaxNinja++
17:40:11 <ingy> thanks
17:41:03 <SyntaxNinja> np
18:00:12 <bourbaki> moin
18:24:48 <clavijo> hi
20:41:00 <a5> is there an easy way to find the type of an unannotated symbol in a source file?
20:41:16 <Pseudonym> :t symbol
20:41:32 <Pseudonym> That should show something like this...
20:41:34 <Pseudonym> @type head
20:41:40 <lambdabot> head :: forall a. [a] -> a
20:42:10 <a5> ok, so how do i load the file in ghci, i'm compiling it with ghc...
20:42:17 <Pseudonym> ghci File.hs
20:44:46 <stepcutHM> yeah! My swf assembler generated valid code :)
20:45:02 <Pseudonym> Does it print "hello world"?
20:45:17 <stepcutHM> Pseudonym: indeed!
20:45:30 <a5> oh, is there an environment variable like LIBRARY_PATH that tells ghc/ghci where to look for extra .hs files?
20:46:04 <a5> "shockwave flash"?
20:46:28 <stepcutHM> http://www.n-heptane.com/test.swf
20:47:44 <stepcutHM> the box intially says "hello, world", but the program then loads "Hello, Earth!" into the text box at run time
20:50:14 <stepcutHM> (set! dynText "Hello, Earth!")
20:55:58 <vdrab> stepcutHM : does that imply you can have a two-way binding between haskell and swf ?! as in, a flash based GUI for haskell programs?
20:58:58 <vdrab> i guess not two-way though...
20:59:04 <vdrab> hmm
21:01:07 <stepcutHM> vdrab: no, I am writing a scheme->swf compiler
21:02:14 <vdrab> oops
21:02:25 <vdrab> sorry, just joined in.
21:03:27 <stepcutHM> it would be possible to write a two-way 'binding' between haskell and swf though -- but the interface between the two would have to  be limited to xml
21:04:27 <vdrab> ... which would not be very handy then, i guess
21:04:44 <stepcutHM> so, you could do something, a bit like X, where you have a flash program that processes incoming gui events, and send keyboard and mouse events back to a haskell backend via xml
21:05:55 <vdrab> that sounds a bit bloated.
21:06:09 <stepcutHM> it really depends on what you want to do, with a scheme->swf (or, theorectically haskell->swf) compiler, you can run the entire application on the users machine -- but you are limited in what you can do
21:06:30 <vdrab> true
21:07:03 <stepcutHM> you can also do a client-server type thing, where the user side handles the glizzy graphics, but the real processing is done on the server -- much like a traditional web browser/html application
21:08:10 <stepcutHM> but, first you need to develop the part that runs in flash on the client machine -- and doing that in the macromedia flash authoring tool in ECMAscript sucks :)
21:08:53 <vdrab> depending on the application, that may be an interesting path to take. but when you're just looking for a nice GUI frontend for plain haskell apps, it's a bit of overkill maybe.
21:10:00 <stepcutHM> true, but web apps are the wave of the future :)
21:11:08 <stepcutHM> java is big a bloated, and html forms are really limiting -- flash is lightweight, flexible, and installed nearly everywhere
21:11:33 <stepcutHM> I would venture to say that machines are more likely to have a working flash install than a working java install :p
21:11:38 * autrijus thinks XUL and/or XForms and/or WHAT Forms is the wave of the future :)
21:12:00 <vdrab> I agree... it's just that if i remember correctly flash doesn't talk to the outside world very well.
21:12:01 <stepcutHM> autrijus: that could be nice too
21:12:14 <vdrab> what about LINKS?
21:12:26 <vdrab> it's not GUI specific though.
21:12:28 <stepcutHM> vdrab: right, I think it can only talk back to the server the .swf was downloaded from...
21:13:21 <vdrab> autrijus : saw the pugs article on perl.com. great stuff.
21:15:53 <autrijus> danke :)
21:16:08 <autrijus> I hope I did some haskell advocacy :)
21:16:47 <vdrab> sure did
22:29:47 <ingy> hi autrijus
22:39:45 <juhp> shapr: did you resolve your hsc2hs problem? :)
22:49:30 <Gahhh> Geez. #C++ is a horrid channel.
22:50:25 <Khisanth> s/ a//,s/ channel// :)
22:50:54 <Khisanth> s/#// too
23:05:38 <pesco> Gahhh: Why is that?
23:06:23 <Gahhh> way off topic and... um.. too juvenile.
23:09:23 <pesco> That's sad. I frequented that channel until about, hm, one and a half year ago or so?
23:09:41 <Gahhh> it may be a momentary situation.
23:09:46 <Gahhh> I hope it is heh.
23:09:52 <pesco> Could be, right.
23:10:16 <pesco> The knowledgable people are probably still idling behind the noise.
23:28:39 <araujo> Hello
23:42:39 <musasabi> morning
