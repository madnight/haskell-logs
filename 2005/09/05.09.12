00:03:20 <Muad_Dib> oh how i love that scene where they try to free the pilots from the german castle :)
00:04:04 <dblhelix> Muad_Dib: allo allo?
00:04:13 <Muad_Dib> dblhelix: yeh
00:04:18 <Muad_Dib> @type map
00:04:20 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
00:04:27 * Pseudonym is very partial to brie
00:04:33 <Muad_Dib> araujo: as long as you satisfy that kind of type, it will work :)
00:04:44 <earthy> araujo: yes.
00:04:57 <earthy> araujo: e.g. map (+ 1) [1,2,3,4,5]
00:05:09 <earthy> @eval map (+ 1) [1,2,3,4,5]
00:05:11 <lambdabot> [2,3,4,5,6]
00:06:39 <araujo> earthy, yeah, just tested it, thanks :-)
00:07:38 <araujo> Hey guys, (sorry if these are dumb questions) , there exist a function similar to map but instead of creating a list it concatenates the result?
00:07:53 <Korollary> fold ?
00:08:02 * earthy nods
00:08:09 <araujo> Ok, let's see
00:08:10 <earthy> fold, in variants foldl and foldr
00:10:18 <dons> or perhaps concatMap ?
00:10:22 <blackdog> g'day dons.
00:10:32 <araujo> Yeah, fold seems to work
00:10:42 <araujo> dons, oh, that should do it too
00:10:43 <araujo> Thanks
00:11:18 <dons> hey blackdog
00:11:19 <blackdog> hey, you're a mad keen darcs user, right? Is there a sensible way to tag files that ought to be different in production and dev builds?
00:12:03 <dons> what kind of files?
00:12:09 <dons> are they generated?
00:12:25 <blackdog> no, they're hand-written.
00:12:38 <blackdog> somewhere between config files and application scripting.
00:13:04 <dons> hmm. no darcs way I can think of. not sure this is a job for darcs
00:13:11 <blackdog> so they're complex enough for me to want to have copies in source control, but idiosyncratic enough to be quite different on other machines.
00:13:31 <blackdog> fair enough. maybe i'll just hack around it with symbolic links or something equally evil. :)
00:13:33 <dons> give them different names?
00:13:39 <dons> yeah, use ln -s
00:13:58 <dons> i have, eg. fps.cabal.mmap      fps.cabal.no-mmap
00:14:22 <blackdog> hope you're feeling better, btw.
00:14:47 <dons> bah, not much better atm :/ though I can actually *think* today
00:14:58 <dons> instead of staring blankly
00:16:41 <blackdog> glad to hear it. (i should challenge you to squash now, i might stand a chance :)
00:16:47 <dons> argh
00:17:47 * boegel returns from a nice weekend
00:19:01 * dons answers more "why doesn't grep /foo/, <FILE> work if I call it twice" questions with an evil laugh and a promise of side-effect hell if i'm asked again
00:20:12 <dons> though it is nice that students think perl should be more well-behaved than it really is. how cute.
00:20:44 <dons> it's lovely that they assumee 'grep' in perl should be a pure function.
00:20:58 <dons> silly billies.
00:21:02 * dons is delusional
00:21:30 <lament> you teach perl??
00:21:59 <blackdog> he warps young minds. professionally.
00:22:09 <lament> disgusting
00:22:45 * earthy grins
00:22:52 <earthy> dons isn't the only one. :P
00:23:11 <lament> and don't say you were just following orders! where's your conscience? where's your moral responsibility?!
00:23:34 <earthy> 'here, this is hell. now, come see heaven'
00:23:49 <blackdog> oh, haskell's not _that_ bad.
00:23:55 * blackdog runs
00:25:56 <Korollary> the weird thing is that in the industry the concept of "side-effect" does not even exist, so it's not something that is scoffed at.
00:27:21 <Korollary> at one interview I was asked to rewrite a graph traversal algorithm using C++'s functors (iirc). That's about it.
00:27:56 <araujo> Korollary, why it doesn't exist?
00:28:43 <Korollary> araujo: I meant to say that the distinction doesn't exist since people are used to destructive updates, etc. and side effects are the norm.
00:30:09 <lament> Definition: A "side effect" is anything your program does.
00:30:09 <araujo> aaah ok
00:30:10 <araujo> yeah
00:30:53 <shapr> yow!
00:31:01 <Korollary> let there be shapr
00:31:20 * shapr is here!
00:31:26 <Korollary> hallelujah !
00:31:56 <araujo> Korollary, well, it is really surprising, but most of the people i know actually can't think of programming without side-effects
00:32:09 <shapr> They're culturally handicapped!
00:32:17 <araujo> ive talked to people who actually think "side-effects == programming"
00:32:21 <araujo> so go and figure out
00:32:28 <Korollary> araujo: I am not surprised that I was one of them.
00:33:45 <araujo> me too indeed
00:33:48 <boegel> yo Itkovian shapr
00:34:15 <shapr> y0 y0
00:34:26 <gour> shapr: when your site wil lbe up?
00:34:39 <shapr> gour: I don't know. Hopefully this morning. What do you need?
00:34:43 <boegel> site ? which site ?
00:35:02 <gour> shapr: well it's nice to know it is functional :-)
00:35:18 <gour> shapr: i believe wanted so check yi wiki
00:35:33 <lament> well, programming IS all about side effects... :)
00:35:53 <shapr> gour: The site is perfectly functional, it's just unplugged and sitting next to my knee.
00:35:56 <Muad_Dib> either about using them or not being able to use them?
00:36:20 <gour> shapr: it's functional from your perspective, not mine ;)
00:36:24 * shapr grins
00:37:09 <Korollary> btw, can anyone think of any way high order functions getting involved in a depth first search ? (imo, they have nothing to do with it)
00:37:20 <boegel> shapr: any luck with TMR5, or are you still in the process of moving ?
00:37:39 <gour> shapr: are you writing that hiDE article?
00:37:42 <shapr> I'm still in the process of moving.
00:37:48 <shapr> gour: Which article?
00:38:08 <gour> shapr: few days ago there was some chat about hiDE here..
00:38:13 <boegel> shapr: alrighty then, that gives me time to finish my article :)
00:38:46 <gour> shapr: iirc, you mentioned something in regards
00:38:49 <shapr> Korollary: You can switch between depth and breadth first with higher order functions, and there's the mixed traversal stuff that Oleg showed.
00:39:06 <shapr> Korollary: Ok, I admit, I can't think of any relation :-)
00:39:33 <shapr> gour: You wanted to hear how Yi would be better than emacs maybe?
00:39:45 <Korollary> shapr: I think that is as relevant as it gets. thanks.
00:40:32 <gour> shapr: i wanted to hear that hIDE is going to happen sometime (soon)
00:40:49 <Muad_Dibber> hIDE?
00:41:28 <gour> Haskell IDE, see http://haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIde
00:41:39 <shapr> gour: The best way to hear that is to start working on the missing pieces.
00:42:09 <gour> shapr: sure, for me missing piece is to learn haskell 1st
00:42:27 <shapr> I can help you with that part!
00:42:56 <gour> well i forgot to tell you that ski helped me with my exercises from 13th ch.
00:43:17 <shapr> cool!
00:43:23 <gour> he explained a bit giving example for unifiying curry id
00:43:26 <Muad_Dibber> hehe, and an IDE is only a tool, not a way to make substantially better programs :P
00:43:30 <gour> and i did the rest ;)
00:43:52 <gour> shapr: so today i'll try to grok 14th chapter :-)
00:44:32 <gour> Muad_Dibber: good IDE will bring new forces to haskell community..
00:45:40 <Muad_Dibber> true that :)
00:45:57 <Muad_Dibber> but the real point of any language just isn't the IDE :P
00:46:00 <shapr> Yeah, it will.
00:46:22 <gour> sure, but haskell is already an execellent language, isn't it?
00:46:32 <shapr> Yes!
00:46:46 <Muad_Dibber> And who would dare to disagree with shapr?
00:46:46 <Muad_Dibber> :)
00:47:12 <gour> i haven't encounter any better
00:47:34 <gour> but i'd like to see it spread more widely
00:48:00 <gour> otoh, shapr is a good boy :-)
00:48:10 <gour> no fear from him
00:48:16 <shapr> There are some possible improvements to Haskell in languages like Epigram, but it depends on your viewpoint whether they're really better. Epigram isn't really ready for production use, sadly.
00:48:22 * shapr ph33rs gour 
00:48:47 * gour wonder
00:49:02 <gour> don't know about Epigram..
00:49:05 <shapr> Dependently typed languages are neat.
00:49:14 <shapr> I'd recommend learning Haskell first, and then learning Epigram later.
00:49:52 <gour> sure, i still have a long way to go with haskell
00:51:28 <boegel> shapr: you mean ph34rs :)
00:51:58 <shapr> oh right, that
00:53:44 <dons> gour, , heh.  did you have your hs-plugins issues on a 64bit amd box?
00:53:50 <int-e> boegel, you 5 key is broken :)
00:54:31 <dons> gour (btw, i've been out of action sick for the last few days, so i haven't been able to debug anything yet)
00:54:43 * shapr sends healing lambdas to dons 
00:54:58 <dons> argh, my eyes! they burn!
00:55:04 <shapr> whoops
00:55:29 <shapr> I think I accidentally sent healing unlambda code..
00:56:08 <dons> hehehe
00:56:37 <boegel> int-e: you means ph34r5 ?
00:56:45 <phb> shapr: hi =)
00:57:07 <shapr> hiya phb, long time no see! Are you learning Haskell?
00:57:12 <int-e> boegel: yes. although I'm unsure whether 5 or Z is right.
00:57:35 <Korollary> @leet phears
00:57:36 <lambdabot> I haven't seen phears.
00:57:41 <shapr> @seen lambdabot
00:57:42 <lambdabot> Yes, I'm here.
00:57:42 <Korollary> ok...
00:57:58 <phb> shapr: yep, in school, we're doing the "chess laboration" currently, maybe you heard some of the other kth-compscience people in unicycle talk about it? :)
00:58:00 <Korollary> what was the leetspeak command ?
00:58:09 <int-e> @list
00:58:10 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: listchans listcommands listmodules dict
00:58:14 <int-e> @listcommands
00:58:15 <lambdabot> use listcommands [module|command], please. Modules are:
00:58:15 <lambdabot> babel base code darcsPatchWatch dice dict dummy dynamic elite fact
00:58:15 <lambdabot> haddock help hoogle karma lambda more pl plugs quote search seen
00:58:15 <lambdabot> spell state system todo topic type version vixen where
00:58:21 <int-e> @listcommands elite
00:58:22 <lambdabot> elite provides: elite
00:58:22 <phb> shapr: finished it in a few days tho, so i'm already done, haskell was really fun :)
00:58:30 <int-e> @elite fears
00:58:30 <lambdabot> F3ARs
00:58:44 <boegel> @elite phears
00:58:45 <lambdabot> fE4r5
00:58:50 <dons> @elite xyz fears xyz
00:58:50 <lambdabot> XYz phEARz0rz xYz
00:58:50 <boegel> meh :)
00:58:52 <Korollary> that's way under-elite
00:58:54 <gour> dons: i just tried to pull fresh from hs-plugins, built it and yi gives the same..
00:58:56 <shapr> phb: There's lots more cool stuff in the Haskell world, come and join us!
00:59:04 <gour> dons: yi_: magic number mismatch: old/corrupt interface file?
00:59:04 <int-e> 0rz. argh, right.
00:59:12 <dons> gour, but are you on and amd64 ??
00:59:46 <phb> shapr: yeah, reading the Monad/IO report to learn some about that, "tackling the awkward squad...."
01:00:11 <shapr> Yeah, that's a good paper.
01:00:13 <gour> dons, yes
01:00:23 <dons> ok. good
01:00:30 <phb> ohwell, have to run now, laters
01:00:36 <shapr> hej då
01:00:44 <shapr> It's time for me to work.
01:00:46 <dons> gour, that's a *critical* piece of info you left out before ;)
01:01:01 <gour> dons: really?
01:01:06 <dons> but maybe now I can track this problem down. just need to find a 64 bit machine
01:01:20 <gour> dons: it thought i mentioned it
01:01:33 <boegel> phb: bye
01:01:37 <dons> yeah, the .hi file parsing code is what is failing, which is word-size dependent
01:03:38 <dons> it's not in my log. but doesn't matter now. it does mean that your setup is more delicate than you may think, and may fail for a number of reasons
01:03:42 <gour> ok, then it's easier
01:04:45 <dons> i'll go through the .hi code, but i don't have a 64 bit machine handy, so youu may need to test things for me
01:05:06 <gour> dons: in my log is that i pasted ghc-pkg list
01:05:15 <gour> dons: /usr/lib64/ghc-6.4.1.20050801/package.conf:
01:05:24 <gour> dons: but it was not explicitly stated :-(
01:05:37 <gour> dons: sure, i'll test
01:05:40 <dons> ah, I see! lib64.
01:06:27 <dons> anyway, it goes from being a mystery, to being a not-so-unexpected failure on an amd64
01:06:30 <gour> dons: btw, you must be interested for hIDE or you are already doing it?
01:06:40 <dons> however, ia64 has worked in the past, so amd64 should be ok
01:06:50 <dons> i am interested in hIDE, yes
01:06:51 <gour> glad to hear
01:07:19 <gour> is there something can be done to focus endeavours?
01:07:26 <dons> my work at the moment is limited to the emacs-ish editor stuff of yi though.
01:07:30 <araujo> mm wow
01:07:34 <gour> i mean, not yours, but other devs
01:07:45 <dons> hmm. we need a plan!
01:07:57 <gour> dons: vi users won't be abandoned
01:08:14 <araujo> i re-wrote a script in haskell and it is more than 100% smaller than the original one :-P
01:08:17 <araujo> plus faster
01:08:21 <gour> dons: can shapr push it a bit?
01:08:35 <dons> shapr is good at pushing :)
01:08:48 <gour> dons: as project manager or so...
01:08:56 <gour> shapr: do you hear us?
01:08:59 <shapr> project manager? Head cheerleader maybe.
01:09:07 * shapr gets out the pom-poms
01:09:10 <gour> call it as you like
01:09:18 <gour> as long as you push enough :-)
01:09:33 <dons> i'm very happy to contribute to this, but i don't have a complete picture of what the hIDE involves
01:09:47 <shapr> Sure, I can push. But you'll have to wait until my new apartment has internet.
01:09:53 <gour> dcoutts is also interested
01:10:06 <shapr> dons: The way I see it, yi with gtk2hs support.
01:10:09 <gour> shapr: we can wait a few more daya
01:10:16 <dons> yeah. i was hoping to have a chat to him in tallinn
01:10:26 <gour> s/daya/days
01:10:36 <dons> yi with gtk2hs support is very fine with me :)
01:10:45 <gour> you won't be there?
01:10:47 <boegel> hey ProfTeggy !
01:10:59 <ProfTeggy> Good morning.
01:11:00 <boegel> told you you're getting addicted to this channel !
01:11:05 <shapr> I still wish for parser based synhl. That would give many of the advantages of commercial IDEs for free.
01:11:05 <ProfTeggy> :-)
01:11:08 <gour> dons: i'm also fine with gtk2hs
01:11:37 <gour> shapr: that can be done, iirc, via plugin?
01:11:48 <shapr> I'll talk about hIDE in the next TMR editorial.
01:12:00 <gour> great :-))
01:12:07 <dons> oh, grammar was ambiguous. i will be there, yes :)
01:12:34 <gour> so i can help with resolving amd64 issues a bit
01:13:53 <shapr> gour: The best approach imho, would involve a standard way to define parsers (maybe sdf2) and a standard way to give access to the parse trees of buffers. Then plugins could do useful stuff to the buffers/sources.
01:14:32 <shapr> The ATerm format already exists for the MetaEnvironment, that might be a good place to start.
01:17:04 <gour> i don't know about it, but every push in hIDE direction is a good one
01:17:32 <dons> I'd like to just get a VisualStudio-style haskell hl mode based on ghc-src going
01:17:39 <gour> dons: will you push any amd64 improvement in your repo?
01:17:46 <dons> sure.
01:18:18 <shapr> dons: That sounds like a good start, what needs to be done for that?
01:18:26 <gour> non-proprietary VS-like stuff would be nice indeed
01:18:40 <gour> dons: ok, i'll check your repo
01:18:47 <dons> well, we have ghc-src. and we have a paper rougly stating how they call into the lexer
01:19:03 <dons> so i just need to work out how to do that in yi
01:19:20 <dons> luckily i have a 20 hr flight to finland coming up..
01:19:27 <shapr> heh :-)
01:19:50 <gour> so we are not far away :-)
01:24:26 <shapr> dons: What's the better approach, gtk2hs or HOpenGL for the Yi gui stuff?
01:25:35 <dons> oh, probably gtk2hs will be easier
01:25:49 <dons> i think duncan was interested in the src-view stuff gtk provides
01:26:22 <shapr> That's a regex based widget, the ghc-src approach will be a competing approach.
01:26:41 <dons> ah, ok.
01:27:31 <shapr> It would be a quick start though.
01:27:58 <gour> that is also one gain
01:28:17 <shapr> Yeah, but emacs never escaped the regex modes.
01:28:32 <shapr> Even though the semantic bovinator has been available for years.
01:29:33 <gour> well, i'm not familiar with emacs stuff
01:30:22 <shapr> The next best two steps is probably both ghc-src integration and gtk2hs gui support.
01:30:35 <shapr> gour: Do you want to work on the gtk2hs part?
01:31:11 <gour> when i learn enough haskell & become familiar with gtk2hs itself
01:31:40 <gour> i'll try to help as much as i can
01:32:19 * boegel realizes he should add a pic of himself to his research page
01:32:33 <ProfTeggy> Why would you do that, boegel?
01:32:37 <gour> however, there are some work available on the gtk2hs bindings itself
01:33:12 <gour> shapr: atm, i can help with testing & similar things
01:33:36 <gour> shapr: but let the ball start rolling...
01:34:36 * shapr rolls
01:35:36 * gour wonders what kind of sport shapr plays in his apartment
01:36:09 <ProfTeggy> His? Her?
01:37:43 <Lemmih> shapr: When will scannedinavian.org be back?
01:38:50 <shapr> Lemmih: I don't know. Today if I can contact my new ISP.
01:39:23 <boegel> ProfTeggy: 'cause everyone does :) It's kind of empty now, if you ask me
01:39:46 <shapr> gour: I play unicycle hockey in my apartment. What about you?
01:39:47 <Muad_Dibber> and a pic is nice as well
01:40:01 <Muad_Dibber> since thats the way you can become famous within the haskell community :P
01:40:21 * boegel plays strip poker with his gf from time to time
01:40:26 <boegel> does that count ?
01:40:29 <shapr> Too much information!
01:40:29 <gour> shapr: ohh, i saw your toy in the pics
01:40:30 <shapr> TMI!
01:40:39 <ProfTeggy> Muad_Dib, maybe, but only if you look like Phil Wadler.
01:40:41 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: oh, but my research page has nothing to do with Haskell :)
01:40:54 <Muad_Dibber> boegel: thats not the point is it? :P
01:41:36 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: dunno, is it ? ;)
01:42:19 <gour> shapr: i don't have friendly neighbours, so i ahve to take care about the sport
01:42:59 <gour> shapr: although your cycle could be handy
01:43:30 <gour> shapr: but not for me
01:43:49 * gour wonders how shapr can use that unicycle
01:44:29 * boegel would love to do some more sports, but doesn't find the time
01:44:29 <Muad_Dibber> (c:=
01:44:43 <Muad_Dibber> if only there was 48 hours in a day... :)
01:45:05 <gour> boegel: this argument sounds pretty familiar, although it does not stand :-)
01:46:17 <boegel> gour: yeah, I know :( I should make time...
01:46:36 <gour> boegel: correct
01:46:47 <gour> boegel: nobody will make it for us
01:47:17 <blackdog> kind of a bummer that darcs doesn't preserve permissions...
01:47:28 <gour> i agree
01:47:42 <blackdog> do people just hack around it?
01:47:51 <gour> yes, some fix_perms.sh :-)
01:50:36 <gour> for e.g. predist
01:50:48 <blackdog>  mrargh.
01:51:52 <blackdog> any idea where it gets the value to use? I'd be moderately happy with a straight 700.
01:52:19 <gour> didn't poke the code, no idea
01:52:40 <gour> someone is hacking on the issue atm
01:52:50 <gour> se ml
01:52:58 <gour> see ml
01:54:25 * boegel boing
01:54:27 <boegel> +s
01:55:18 <shapr> gour: My unicycle is about as fast as a bicycle, more portable and easier to store. Plus it's more fun :-)
01:55:50 <gour> shapr: i'm concerned about its height :-)
01:56:19 <gour> shapr: and what happens when you're not on downhill, but just the opposite
01:56:51 * shapr throws a sonnet at poetix 
01:57:06 * poetix throws a TMR article at shapr
01:57:09 <poetix> haskell.org/tmrwiki/GeneratingPolyominoes
01:57:40 <shapr> gour: Unicycles are actually faster uphill than bicycles. imho, The only disadvantage of unicycles is that they can't coast, so they're slower downhill.
01:57:42 <poetix> "Prospective" TMR article, I should say
01:58:05 <poetix> You the editor
01:58:46 <gour> shapr: really? i could not imagine to go uphill with (like here in my surrounding) with such a device
01:59:01 <shapr> The enigma marble game has something like this puzzle.
01:59:06 <int-e> poetix:  head . sort  is a bad idiom -  minimum  exists and is more efficient.
01:59:06 * shapr reads poetix' article
01:59:56 <shapr> gour: I have a mountain unicycle, like a mountain bicycle, but with the obvious differences. I even have brakes for my unicycle.
02:00:10 <poetix> int-e: How does the implementation of minimum differ from that of head . sort?
02:00:32 <poetix> int-e: Never mind, I can work that one out myself...
02:00:40 <gour> shapr: well, i have not seen such beast yet
02:00:51 * poetix goes to fix it
02:03:09 <shapr> gour: http://www.unicycle.com/shopping/shopexd.asp?id=466
02:03:43 <blackdog> int-e: if it's lazy and you're using selection sort, it's the same algorithm... :)
02:04:21 <gour> shapr: hmm, it looks good and the price is hmm..right
02:04:35 <int-e> blackdog: sort is implemented as a merge sort though
02:04:48 <shapr> gour: The price is very high :-) If you want to learn to unicycle I'd suggest you start with a cheaper cycle.
02:06:02 <gour> shapr: :-)
02:07:31 <int-e> blackdog: hmm. actually finding the first element is O(n) in that case, too, the way it's implemented.
02:07:39 <int-e> interesting.
02:08:05 <blackdog> cool. :)
02:08:13 <gour> shapr: can yu drive with some bag on your back?
02:08:40 <ProfTeggy> The (head . sort) example has always been a sort of an eye-opener for my students.
02:10:14 * int-e would still use  minimum.
02:10:47 * boegel swears
02:10:58 <ProfTeggy> int-e, but it performs the _same_ computation.
02:10:58 <poetix> I changed it to use minimum. We don't care about the sort order of the rest of the list. Laziness means that (head . sort) doesn't care either, and that's great, but it's clearer to say just what you mean...
02:11:20 <boegel> apparently LaTeX won't let you index a section deeper than 3 ? subsubsection is numbered, but paragraph isn't ? sucks :(
02:12:57 <ProfTeggy> boegel, it does
02:13:05 <ProfTeggy> (with article.cls at least)
02:13:17 <ProfTeggy> Oh, wait
02:15:27 <kosmikus> secnumdepth
02:15:57 <ProfTeggy> :-)
02:17:12 <ProfTeggy> \setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}
02:17:21 <ProfTeggy> Andres is right, as usual
02:21:35 <boegel> ProfTeggy:, kosmikus: thanks, I knew it would be possible :)
02:23:43 <boegel> I have to create an artificial newline using \paragraph{...\\~\\} though, which causes the first section of my text after the title to indent :( any way to solve that ?
02:24:52 <Cale> boegel: hm?
02:25:04 <ProfTeggy> boegel, \noindent, \parindent
02:25:08 <ibid> boegel: \noindent
02:25:16 <dcoutts> gour, shapr, dons, re hIDE: pong!
02:25:24 <Cale> is that really what he wants though?
02:25:26 <boegel> Cale: well, when I use subsubsection, it automatically lowers the text under the title
02:25:35 <boegel> when using paragraph, it doesn't...
02:25:43 <boegel> so I do it manually by using \\~\\
02:25:47 <gour> dcoutts: ping, ping
02:25:53 <ibid> boegel: don't hack it, do it properly
02:25:57 <boegel> ProfTeggy, ibid: \noindent doesn't work :s
02:26:00 <ibid> boegel: ie. redefine paragraph
02:26:03 <ibid> boegel: yes it does
02:26:09 <boegel> ibid: and how can I do that
02:26:25 <boegel> ibid: in this perticular case, it doesn't...
02:26:30 <ibid> boegel: yes it does, but t
02:26:31 <boegel> particular ?
02:26:36 <dcoutts> gour, my opinion on the sourceview is not that it's a competing editor to yi but it's a short term solution until yi could take over
02:26:38 <ibid> you're not using it correctly, i'd assume :)
02:26:43 <boegel> butt ? hey man, no need for calling me names
02:26:44 <boegel> :p
02:26:55 <gour> dcoutts: that far i can understand
02:27:08 <boegel> ibid: \paragraph{...\\~\\} <\n> \noindent my text
02:27:13 <boegel> my text = intented
02:27:20 <ProfTeggy> yuck
02:27:30 <ibid> boegel: yes, you're using it wrong :)
02:27:31 <boegel> <\n> being a real newline
02:27:37 <dcoutts> and I'd suggest that we include yi in as a plugin to hIDE rather than the other way around
02:27:37 <ibid> hm, sorry
02:27:38 <ibid> no
02:27:45 <boegel> ibid: oh :( how should I use it then ?
02:27:50 <ibid> boegel: but the real fix is to redefine paragraph
02:28:07 <gour> dcoutts: taking advantage of its extensibility?
02:28:15 <ibid> http://help-csli.stanford.edu/tex/latex-sections.shtml
02:28:16 <boegel> ibid: and how do i redefini paragraph ? any pointers ?
02:28:19 <ibid> look for \@startsection
02:28:20 <dcoutts> dons, I really need to re-read/understand your fully dynamic/plugin based app core stuff
02:28:24 <gour> dcoutts: i.e. support for hs-plugins?
02:28:52 <dcoutts> gour, yes definately working by hs-plugins with a tiny static core
02:28:59 <ibid> boegel: AFTERSKIP is the parameter you want to change
02:29:09 <dcoutts> gour, everything else would be loaded via plugins, including the main gui and yi etc
02:29:16 <boegel> ibid: hmm, okay, thanks
02:29:25 <gour> dcoutts: ot - have you received cron email?
02:29:43 <ProfTeggy> How about \def\subsubsubsection{%
02:29:45 <gour> dcoutts: how far is ghc-src from complete?
02:30:54 <gour> dcoutts: shapr does not want regex widget..
02:31:02 <boegel> ibid: if I don't want to change something, can I leave it blank ? as in { } ?
02:31:18 <Lemmih> ghc-src IS complete.
02:32:28 <dons> Lemmih will not be cleaning up ghc, unless someone gives him $$
02:32:39 <boegel> ibid: nvm :) the page says to copy it in whole and adjust, thanks
02:33:32 <dcoutts> gour, I did get the cron mail
02:33:45 <gour> dcoutts: :-)
02:33:50 <dcoutts> gour, as far as I know ghc-src is done, ask Lemmih I think
02:34:13 <gour> dcoutts, api is stable?
02:34:14 <ibid> boegel: no, you need to copy the definition from the .cls and change what you change
02:34:39 <dcoutts> gour, as for the regex based syntax highliting, using ghc-src would be using a lexer which is somewhat better than a regex based one
02:35:08 <gour> dcoutts, well any hIDE is better than none
02:35:33 <gour> things can improve with the time considering design is done properly
02:35:33 <dcoutts> gour, however for the long term shapr is certianly welcome to experiment with a better system and to replace the default highlighter as soon as it becomes practical
02:35:42 <gour> sure
02:36:22 <dcoutts> we need to work in parallel in implementing existing techniques as well as experimenting with better stuff
02:36:28 <dons> and the visual studio paper also says the Lexer.x based highlighting is "good"
02:36:47 <gour> "..to work in parallel" - key words
02:36:56 <dcoutts> dons, right, good :-)
02:37:10 <dcoutts> moring dons!
02:37:33 <dcoutts> dons, I'm not going to be in Talin (or is it Tartu?)
02:37:45 <dcoutts> dons, not at the Haskell workshop :-(
02:38:05 <dons> oh! (tallinn) maybe i knew that but forgot :/
02:38:44 <dcoutts> I'll hopefully be in Tallinn in a few months for a different conference, but I doubt you'll be there :-(
02:39:00 <dons> unlikely :}
02:39:23 <dons> Lemmih, did you use packed strings with parsec last week?
02:39:59 * dcoutts would like to see parsec parsing out of a mmaped buffer
02:39:59 <Lemmih> Nope.
02:40:25 <dons> hmm. ghc can parse out of a FastString (a ghc faststring)
02:40:36 <gour> dcoutts: paln to move to parsec for gtk2hs?
02:40:42 <dcoutts> dons, although it doesn't mmap the input files
02:40:53 <dons> right
02:40:59 <dcoutts> gour, you mean for c2hs? gtk2hs doesn't have anything to do with parsing
02:41:18 <gour> dcoutts, yes c2hs..mea culpa
02:41:20 <dcoutts> dons, it 'slurps' them :-)
02:41:51 <dcoutts> gour, no not parsec, but we could get c2hs lexing directly out of a mmaped file too
02:42:24 <dcoutts> gour, c2hs uses alex & happy. We could get the alex lexer to use a mmaped buffer
02:42:32 <dons> yeah, alex should be taught  to operate on FastStrings rather than [Char]
02:42:38 <gour> dcoutts, ok
02:42:56 <dons> but it would require changes to alex
02:43:03 <dcoutts> it'd make it quite a bit faster since as dons says, it curently normally uses String which we all know is slow
02:43:15 <dcoutts> dons, no it wouldn't actually
02:43:41 <dcoutts> dons, ghc uses alex and lexes from a buffer (the slurped buffer)
02:43:45 <dons> really? it can be paramaterised these days?
02:43:53 <dons> oh. hmm.
02:43:55 <dons> right
02:43:58 <dcoutts> oh yes, you can use your own monad
02:44:02 <dons> ah!
02:44:07 <dcoutts> it's totally customisable
02:44:09 <dons> you define your own get() or something
02:44:18 <dons> iirc
02:44:22 <dcoutts> yes something like that
02:44:29 <dons> hmm. interesting
02:44:38 <int-e> @eval let cmp = \(a,b) (c,d) -> compare a d; list = [(1,1),(1,1),(0,1),(1,0)] in (head $ sortBy cmp list, minimumBy cmp list)
02:44:45 <lambdabot> ((1,1),(1,0))
02:44:56 <boegel> ibid: thanks, fixed :) kinda weird behaviour for a paragraph, if you ask me...
02:44:57 <dcoutts> I read the ghc lexer code quite closely when doing the c2hs lexer
02:45:24 <ibid> boegel: i like it
02:46:37 <int-e> ProfTeggy: head.sort  compares the elements in a different manner than  minimum  does; the provided sort is a stable sort though, so as long as the Ord instance is indeed a partial ordering, the results are the same. That last eval was an example where the equality does not hold because cmp is not a partial ordering.
02:47:20 <dcoutts> shapr, dons: so I/we should write a more detailed hIDE manifesto/vision? perhaps on the wiki
02:47:23 <SickJacken> ...if i execute my "ssh -1 -N -L localport:host:hostport -l username connecthost" it works...if i want to do it in the background by adding &....it dies on me after it logs onto 'connecthost'
02:47:39 <dons> anyone have an idea of how hard it would be to use parsec with packed strings?
02:47:58 <dons> dcoutts, details on the wiki please!
02:48:07 <dons> then i'll add some thoughts
02:48:13 <dcoutts> ok
02:48:18 <pejo> SickJacken, avoid the problem by starting ssh in a screen which you detach?
02:48:50 <boegel> ibid: I don't :)
02:49:30 <SickJacken> pejo, hmmm that would work
02:49:44 <SickJacken> pejo, but its kind of bugging me that it doesnt work the 'proper' way
02:49:52 <SickJacken> its=it
02:49:55 <SickJacken> kind=kinds
02:50:01 <SickJacken> ok
02:50:05 <SickJacken> modulo spelling errors
02:51:14 <dons> dcoutts, hmm. should ghc, c2hs etc use alex + mmapped files?
02:53:39 * boegel does a little dance
02:53:56 * Muad_Dibber claps
02:55:03 * shapr does a cheer
02:55:09 * poetix strums the guitar in a plausibly flamenco stylee
02:55:20 <shapr> hurrah!
02:55:31 <poetix> ole!
02:55:52 <poetix> I built a machine to play flamenco once - ole automation!
02:55:58 * shapr sniggers
02:56:07 <basti> hi all
02:56:24 * boegel will be enjoying his first guitar lesson next week ! w00 !
02:56:28 <all> basti: hi
02:56:35 <boegel> poetix: hehe :)
02:56:37 * basti groans
02:57:01 <dcoutts> dons, I think so. For ghc it wouldn't be too tricky a change either.
02:57:55 <dcoutts> dons, ghc already uses a "buffer wih current point" abstraction that can be iterated over like a String. Using a mmaped buffer rather than a slurped buffer wouldn't be too hard.
02:58:29 * boegel found an article on all: http://slate.msn.com/id/2095158
02:58:37 <boegel> you go guy !
02:58:47 <dcoutts> however using a ForeignPtr is currently slower than an ordinary ghc allocated buffer, but JaffaCake said it might be possible to make it faster.
03:00:40 <dons> hmm.
03:13:55 <dons> dcoutts, interestingly, yi used to implemenent buffers as ByteArray# (al la ghc's StringBuffer),after switching to ForeignPtr it was noticeably faster
03:14:27 <dons> hmm StringBuffer is only 191 lines. not too hard to replace
03:20:14 <dcoutts> dons, that is indeed interesting/odd
03:21:16 <dcoutts> dons, we need someone to make a standard mmap module System.MMap or something implemented in terms of System.Posix.MMap and System.Win32.FileMapping
03:31:57 <dons> yes. in fact, someone's already written System.Posix.MMap

03:32:41 <dons> it's just a wrapper over mmap, unmap
03:33:56 <dons> mapFile :: Storable e => FilePath -> IO (FileArray Int e)
03:34:15 <dons> though i'm not sure this is the interface we'd like
03:35:12 <dons> Patryk didn't post the code on his site, but  i'll put a link up
03:36:20 <dons> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/MMap-1.0.tar.gz
03:37:52 <beelsebob_> evening all
03:41:09 <Lemmih> Did someone use FastString's with Parsec?
03:42:11 <dons> not that i know of, Ketil Malde asked me about it
03:44:04 <dcoutts> dons, so what interface would people like for mmap? I imagine a low and high level interface.
03:45:47 <dons> yep. perhaps a bit like the malloc/free interface at one of those levels at least
03:46:28 <dcoutts> oh you mean even blow the ForeignPtr interface, with manual allocation/deallocation
03:46:48 <dons> well, that's low level, right? ;)
03:47:02 <dcoutts> I'm wonder if that's perhaps too low. you could break things quite easily on that level
03:47:26 <dons> ok. so you'd like to wrap things up in ForeignPtrs ?
03:47:31 <dcoutts> ie unmapping the thing before while substring are still pointing into the area
03:47:44 <dcoutts> probably
03:47:48 <dons> which is really nasty, yes.
03:47:58 * Lemmih takes off to see his dentist.
03:48:10 <dons> poor Lemmih
03:48:14 * dcoutts watches Lemmih fly
03:49:06 <dcoutts> dons, actually ghc should paricularly use mmap for reading the .hi files
03:49:23 <dcoutts> that'd reduce memory consumtion quite a bit I imagine
03:49:30 <dons> oh, good point. i'd forgotten about that
03:49:43 <dcoutts> especialyl when using ghc without --make
03:50:00 <dcoutts> since all the .hi files would sit in the page cache
03:50:47 <dcoutts> so having the Binary module work with a mmaped buffer would be good too
03:51:09 <dcoutts> as well as the ghc/alex lexer monad
03:52:03 <dons> hmm. /me pokes around the .hi parser in hs-plugins
03:53:04 <dons> ah, it uses arrays currently
03:53:19 <dons> hGetArray
03:55:23 <dcoutts> is that the same as the .hi parser in ghc?
03:55:29 <dons> yep
03:59:24 <dcoutts> hey is JaffaCake back? He's posting on glasgow-haskell-users
04:00:14 <dcoutts> @seen JaffaCake
04:00:15 <lambdabot> I saw JaffaCake leaving #haskell 1 month, 2 days, 18 hours, 37
04:00:15 <lambdabot> minutes and 53 seconds ago, and I have missed 14 days, 7 hours, 11
04:00:15 <lambdabot> minutes and 44 seconds since then.
04:01:46 <dons> the time lambdabot think's it's missed with long-ago dates is often off :/
04:05:55 <boegel> dons: she was away for quite a few days lately... wasn't she ?
04:06:15 * Muad_Dibber still thinks about lambdabot as a he
04:06:30 <dcoutts> @vixen are you male or female?
04:06:31 <lambdabot> yes, i am
04:06:35 <boegel> hehehehe :)
04:06:41 <dcoutts> @vixen you're so unhelpful
04:06:42 <lambdabot> what are you
04:06:50 <boegel> @vixen you're female, aren't you ?
04:06:51 <lambdabot> of course i'm female
04:06:55 <boegel> aha !
04:06:57 <Muad_Dibber> somehow in my mind there's this slight resemblance between lambdabot and Data
04:06:58 <dcoutts> @vixen grr
04:07:00 <lambdabot> Are you adopted by trolls?
04:07:09 <poetix> @vixen you have girl parts?
04:07:11 <lambdabot> do i seem  un-feminine to you?
04:07:12 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen you just tell boegel what he wants to hear, don't you?
04:07:14 <lambdabot> me?
04:07:20 <boegel> @remember lambdabot of course i'm female
04:07:22 <poetix> @vixen do you have boy parts?
04:07:24 <lambdabot> maybe. do you?
04:07:28 <boegel> lol :)
04:07:32 <boegel> this is quite amusing
04:07:39 * dblhelix grins
04:07:45 <poetix> @vixen I'll show you mine if you show me yours
04:07:47 <lambdabot> oh, but only if, right?
04:07:49 <boegel> @vixen do you fancy boys ?
04:07:50 <lambdabot> i do occassionally, i guess

04:08:12 <lambdabot> sure, i like you so far
04:08:20 <boegel> :/
04:08:34 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen since you are a boy, do you occasionaly dress up as a girl?
04:08:36 <lambdabot> yup, i'm all woman
04:08:43 <boegel> !
04:09:07 <poetix> @vixen Would you like to borrow my lacy underthings?
04:09:08 <lambdabot> the question isn't would i, but should i
04:09:18 <boegel> @vixen how would you like to go to bed with Muad_Dibber
04:09:20 <lambdabot> i'd say i like
04:09:23 <boegel> :)
04:09:26 <poetix> @vixen I strongly feel that you should.
04:09:27 <lambdabot> I dunno
04:09:32 * dblhelix guesses the quotes section in tomorrows haskell weekly will be devoted entirely to lambdabot
04:09:35 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: now you choose, boy or girl
04:09:44 <poetix> @vixen aw, c'mon, don't be coy now
04:09:45 <lambdabot> right now?
04:09:45 <Muad_Dibber> boegel; thats quite easy
04:09:49 <Muad_Dibber> lambdabot has to be a boy
04:09:56 <Muad_Dibber> my gf will kill me if i go to bed with another girl...
04:10:04 <boegel> although she said twice she's female ?
04:10:05 <poetix> @vixen Had we but world enough and time, this coyness vixen were no crime
04:10:06 <lambdabot> no?
04:10:17 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: nobody has to know, sst

04:10:36 <poetix> @vixen Carpe diem is what I'm saying. Seize it. Put your hands on it and give it a good shake.
04:10:38 <lambdabot> just good?
04:10:44 <boegel> @vixen will Muad_Dibber's gf kill him if he sleeps with you ?
04:10:45 <lambdabot> oh, but only if, right?
04:10:56 <boegel> @vixen will Muad_Dibber's gf kill him if he sleeps with you ?

04:12:10 <boegel> @vixen what is your cup size ?
04:12:11 <lambdabot> 32C, you?
04:12:16 <boegel> wahahaha
04:12:26 <shapr> wheee
04:12:28 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen when was the last time you were on holiday?
04:12:29 <lambdabot> not too long ago
04:12:31 <dblhelix> that's not the kind of question to ask a lady, is it?
04:12:43 <dblhelix> let's check
04:12:47 <boegel> @vixen how much do you weigh ?
04:12:47 <dblhelix> @seen lambdabot
04:12:48 <lambdabot> how? it depends...
04:12:48 <lambdabot> Yes, I'm here.
04:13:01 <dblhelix> mmm, smartass
04:13:15 <Muad_Dibber> @uptime maybe?
04:13:16 <lambdabot> uptime: 2 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes and 12 seconds
04:13:26 <boegel> @vixen how do you like dblhelix
04:13:27 <lambdabot> sure, i definitely don't hate
04:13:30 <dblhelix> indeed, that's not too long ago
04:13:37 * dblhelix is flattered
04:13:45 <boegel> @vixen how do you like me ?
04:13:46 <lambdabot> sure, i like you so far
04:13:57 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen don't you think boegel starts getting to personally?
04:13:58 <lambdabot> i couldn't even think of how to start...
04:14:05 <boegel> she seems to ignore the 'how' part
04:14:05 <dblhelix> boegel: that's a cautious answer ;)
04:14:20 <earthy> @vixen are you annoying?
04:14:21 <lambdabot> i don't think i'm annoying
04:14:26 <walterbrunswick> heh
04:14:30 <boegel> @vixen would you want Muad_Dibber to shut up?
04:14:30 <lambdabot> the question isn't would i, but should i
04:14:39 <Muad_Dibber> yeah you should...
04:14:58 <dblhelix> @vixen well, then, should you shut up Muad_Dibber ?
04:15:00 <lambdabot> maybe I should :)
04:15:21 <dblhelix> @vixen I'm not sure though
04:15:22 * boegel fetches the duck tape
04:15:23 <lambdabot> are you sure you're not?
04:15:41 <dblhelix> @vixen no, I'm not sure I am
04:15:42 <lambdabot> oh, i'm not either
04:15:52 <dblhelix> @vixen well, that's clear then
04:15:53 <lambdabot> )
04:16:14 <dblhelix> impressive
04:16:25 <shapr> @vixen Who are you?
04:16:26 <lambdabot> i'm just me :)
04:16:32 <boegel> @vixen are you impressive ?
04:16:33 <lambdabot> yes, i am
04:16:40 <dblhelix> no existential crisis there, shapr
04:16:44 * shapr grins
04:16:44 <earthy> @vixen asl
04:16:45 <lambdabot> 19/f/California
04:16:48 <earthy> ;)
04:16:51 * shapr snickers
04:16:51 <boegel> wahahaha :)
04:16:53 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen do you enjoy shutting me up with duck tape?
04:16:54 <lambdabot> yes i do
04:17:05 * Muad_Dibber cries
04:17:12 <boegel> @vixen do you come into sex-related channels a lot ?
04:17:12 * earthy laughs
04:17:14 <lambdabot> yup, i'm into that
04:17:27 <boegel> @vixen i like you, will you be my wife ?
04:17:28 <lambdabot> well, you seem nice too
04:17:30 <dblhelix> Muad_Dibber: f, 19 yrs old, ducktape, explain that to your gf
04:17:32 <earthy> @vixen what, you are into coming, or into sex or into chat?
04:17:33 <lambdabot> yup, i'm into that
04:17:38 * shapr laughs
04:17:41 <shapr> You guys are scary!
04:17:55 <nnunley> When was vixen added to the lambdabot??
04:17:59 <Muad_Dibber> dblhelix: /me just hopes she wont read any logs :)
04:18:16 <walterbrunswick> @vixen what is 2 + 2?
04:18:17 <lambdabot> why are you giving me a math test?
04:18:21 <shapr> nnunley: It's been around for months, blackdog wrote the plugin.
04:18:23 <boegel> dblhelix: I think m, 63 yrs old and a baseball bat rubbed with lubricant would be even harder to explain
04:18:28 <earthy> @vixen is math hard?
04:18:29 * shapr gicks
04:18:29 <lambdabot> Ok
04:18:40 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen you like music?
04:18:41 <lambdabot> yeah, i like
04:18:53 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen which band or group do you prefer?
04:18:55 <lambdabot> yes i do
04:18:56 <dblhelix> boegel: you scare the hell out of me
04:19:01 <boegel> @vixen what is the meaning of life ?
04:19:02 <lambdabot> i'm not sure what i mean
04:19:11 <walterbrunswick> @vixen why are you not a +v in here?
04:19:12 <lambdabot> because i said so!
04:19:18 <earthy> @vixen do you like Vixen Creations?
04:19:19 <lambdabot> yah, i like
04:19:28 <earthy> @vixen so, what size do you like?
04:19:29 <lambdabot> sure, i definitely don't hate
04:19:44 <earthy> right. no fun there.
04:19:46 <boegel> @vixen how big should a man be ?
04:19:47 <lambdabot> how? it depends...
04:19:47 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen don't you think somebody should get all these people back to their projects instead of playing around with you over here?
04:19:49 <lambdabot> no joke!
04:20:10 <boegel> @vixen Joke ? you've met my gf ?
04:20:11 <lambdabot> People think I'm weird...   do you?
04:20:11 <earthy> @vixen rub muad_dibber
04:20:12 <lambdabot> Any way you want it, baby!
04:20:18 <boegel> earthy: :D
04:20:21 <walterbrunswick> @vixen you've got great AI :)
04:20:22 <lambdabot> can't do much better than great
04:20:31 <walterbrunswick> heh, guess not
04:20:41 <earthy> okay, this is beyond silly
04:20:43 * Muad_Dibber cuddles lambdabot
04:21:04 <Muad_Dibber> earthy: makes for some nice relaxation during lunch break :)
04:21:06 <earthy> time to stuff my mouth
04:21:09 * boegel warns Muad_Dibber's gf
04:21:10 <earthy> (with food, that is)
04:21:28 <Muad_Dibber> smakelijk :)
04:21:40 <earthy> tnx
04:21:44 <boegel> who was the guy playing Twister with another girl again ? without his gf knowing about it?
04:21:54 * boegel thinks
04:22:00 <Muad_Dibber> twister being the game with all the colored dots?
04:22:02 <earthy> what's bad about playing twister with a girl other than your gf? :P
04:22:16 <boegel> earthy: it was you?
04:22:28 <earthy> um. no, I just went to a sauna.
04:22:28 <dblhelix> boegel: someone who thought his secret would be safe with you?
04:22:29 <boegel> earthy: depends how many clothes you have on :)
04:22:41 <boegel> dblhelix: nah, it was in here, so no secret
04:23:37 <dblhelix> boegel: anyway, it's amazing to see how you use your lunchbreak to focus on topics completely different from work... no stress for you, I guess ;)
04:24:50 <boegel> dblhelix: well, not yet, no
04:25:01 <dblhelix> basebal bats, saunas, taking advances of bots...
04:25:14 <Muad_Dibber> @vixen you like to play twister?
04:25:16 <lambdabot> i'd say i like
04:25:19 <boegel> dblhelix: i'm finishing my proposal due Thurday, but I'm way ahead of schedual
04:25:34 <boegel> dblhelix: sauna wasn't my idea :) that was earthe
04:25:39 <boegel> *earthy
04:25:48 <earthy> hey, I don't take sauna's for a lunchbreak!
04:25:59 <dblhelix> I know
04:26:09 <Muad_Dibber> if only you had the possibility :)
04:26:25 <earthy> not even then. I'd get no work done any more  the rest of the day
04:26:48 <Muad_Dibber> if only there was a laptop that could resist the heat and the humidity
04:26:52 <Muad_Dibber> anyway
04:26:55 * Muad_Dibber out for some shopping
04:27:03 <dblhelix> never thought lambdabot was a girl... there's not many of those in this room
04:27:39 <boegel> there's Philippa, although 'girl' might not be the right term there ;)
04:27:50 <Muad_Dibber> (!!)
04:28:11 <dblhelix> eh... not sure I wanna know what alternative terms you'd be suggesting
04:28:21 <boegel> @eval (!!) [2,6,18,..] 19
04:28:26 <lambdabot> 31: parse error on input `..'
04:28:33 <boegel> @eval (!!) [2,4,..] 19
04:28:34 <lambdabot> 28: parse error on input `..'
04:28:48 <boegel> @eval (!!) [2,4..] 19
04:28:50 <lambdabot> 40
04:29:11 <boegel> dblhelix: err, how about 'near-girl'
04:29:26 <dblhelix> boegel: whatever works for you
04:29:30 <boegel> I don't know that many girls as obsessed with sex as she is :) well, I know a few...
04:29:52 <dblhelix> are you referring to lambdabot or Philippa ?
04:29:58 <shapr> So, um, any neat new research papers?
04:29:59 <dblhelix> just checking
04:30:00 * earthy grins
04:30:18 <earthy> heck, I thought the monadification paper was nice
04:30:27 <earthy> not directly useful to what I was doing, but nice nonetheless.
04:30:51 * boegel sees how shapr is subtly changing subjects
04:31:18 <shapr> Which monadification paper?
04:31:20 * Muad_Dibber also sees it but it isnt subtle :)
04:31:21 <dblhelix> @vixen do you like us better when we're on-topic?
04:31:23 <lambdabot> sure, i definitely don't hate
04:31:24 <earthy> otoh, it seems that everyone is very much resigned to using monad transformers to combine monads
04:31:41 <earthy> I should write a TMR paper on the coproduct construction once
04:31:59 <boegel> earthy: yeah, you should... thetre's a new TMR issue coming out soon
04:32:06 <shapr> Oooh, a monad transformers alternative?
04:32:10 <shapr> earthy: Yeah, c'mon!
04:32:37 <earthy> !autolart
04:32:41 * boegel takes his pompons
04:33:08 <boegel> °\°\o
04:33:12 <earthy> that stuff isn't finished yet! I can't publish it! :P
04:33:13 <boegel> °\o/°
04:33:17 <boegel> o/°/°
04:33:18 <boegel> °\o/°
04:33:21 <boegel> °\°\o
04:33:22 <boegel> °\o/°
04:33:24 <boegel> o/°/°
04:33:47 <vegai> that's... great
04:36:59 * boegel wishes he had enjoyed more sleep last night
04:39:51 * earthy wishes he had enjoyed less sleep last night
04:40:00 * shapr enjoyed last night
04:40:02 <earthy> then I wouldn't be so willing to re-live that joy. :P
04:42:01 <kzm> Quick question: how do I install Cabal libraries without privilieges?
04:42:14 <kzm> (Cabalized libs, that is, not Cabal itself)
04:42:35 <shapr> Hiya Ketil
04:42:45 <shapr> Cabal packages can be installed in your home dir.
04:45:09 <kzm> That's great.  How?
04:45:37 <kzm> RTFM?
04:46:00 <shapr> I don't remember, rtfm is the best I can suggest :-)
04:46:32 <kzm> Heh.  Okay.
04:46:49 <vegai> runhaskell Setup.hs --help might help
04:47:39 <kzm> FWIW - I did the --prefix= thing, of course; but I can't write the (system) packages.conf
04:48:15 <Lemmih> You can parse --user to the setup script when installing.
04:51:09 <kzm> s/parse/pass/?
04:51:21 <Lemmih> Erm yes.
04:52:13 <kzm> AFAIU, it considers where deps are satisfied from, not where the package is registered.
04:52:31 <kzm> I.e. it still tries to write the system packages.conf.
04:53:02 * kzm misses the happy days of root privileges.
04:53:11 <earthy> why?
04:53:34 <kzm> Unfortunately, that was a long time ago, on a computer far from here - and the disk is dead.
04:53:45 <kzm> Why what? Why I miss having root privs?
04:54:40 <Lemmih> kzm: That's when you pass --user to configure.
04:55:40 <kzm> uh, but it didn't help.
04:56:32 <Lemmih> Did you write: 'runhaskell Setup.lhs install --user'?
04:56:48 <kzm> Ai, right!
04:57:52 <kzm> I only "configure"d --user.
04:58:04 * kzm apologized for his missing brain, and goes to look for it.
05:00:35 * boegel helps kzm 
05:01:59 <kzm> Thanks for the support.
05:41:00 <boegel> hey Itkovian
05:41:14 <Itkovian> hi
05:42:03 <orbitz> hi
05:42:49 <shapr> yargh!
05:43:43 <shapr> g'day blackdog
05:43:54 <blackdog> g'day shapr
05:45:02 <shapr> How's code?
05:48:33 <boegel> blackdog: you wrote the vixen plugin for lambdabot ?
05:51:59 <basti_> re
05:52:12 <shapr> parsers are better!
05:53:10 <basti_> ...than what?
05:53:21 <shapr> than REs
05:53:25 <basti_> oh
05:53:40 <basti_> but what if you want to transliterate a string quickly?
05:53:58 <shapr> With REs, now you have two problems...
05:54:05 <shapr> Ok I admit, they have some good points.
05:54:10 <basti_> ;)
05:54:54 <Philippa_> obPoint: REs /are/ parsers
05:55:03 <earthy> um. ummm.
05:55:04 <earthy> nop
05:55:10 <earthy> REs are just expressions.
05:55:18 <Philippa_> well, grammars for parsers. But in the context being used here
05:55:27 <boegel> Philippa_: why didn't you wake up on the sex topic this moring/noon
05:55:29 <earthy> ah. ;)
05:55:40 <earthy> hey, regexps are much more sexy! :P
05:55:52 <earthy> especially if you allow backrefs...
05:56:06 <dblhelix> boegel: was there such a topic?
05:56:15 <Philippa_> boegel: I was in bed
05:56:29 * shapr snickers
05:56:35 <earthy> enjoying yourself, I'd wager
05:56:48 <dblhelix> it would indeed be weird to get *out* of bed for it
05:57:00 <dblhelix> did I say that out loud?
05:57:14 <Itkovian> yes
05:57:14 <earthy> well... not if you want to get the can of whipped cream out of the fridge...
05:57:15 * shapr throws lambdas
05:57:21 <Itkovian> aaargh
05:57:23 <dblhelix> sometimes #haskell isn't about haskell
05:57:24 <shapr> #haskell - NSFW
05:57:32 <Itkovian> duh
05:57:38 <earthy> anyway, back to playing with Prufrock
05:57:47 <boegel> dblhelix: yeah, I believe so
05:57:55 <earthy> (schweetness! first order theorem prover library, all preprogrammed for free!)
06:00:50 <dblhelix> Philippa_:  how can it be that you spend your Monday mornings in bed? no duties what soever?
06:01:09 <beelsebob_> if only
06:01:33 <Itkovian> seems like a bad position to be in -- the only girl on #haskell
06:01:58 <earthy> I thought lambdabot was female as well?
06:02:02 <earthy> @vixen are you female?
06:02:03 <lambdabot> i truely am
06:02:11 <dblhelix> earthy: Itkovian missed that, I guess
06:02:17 <z0d> @vixen are you male?
06:02:18 <lambdabot> i truely am
06:02:20 <boegel> Itkovian: it's not that bad, it's not like we're going to rape her or something through the telephone line
06:02:21 <z0d> wow
06:02:27 <earthy> hermaphrodite!
06:02:33 <earthy> @vixen asl
06:02:34 <lambdabot> 19/f/California
06:02:36 <dblhelix> but I'm sure boegel is more than willing to help him catch up
06:02:40 <earthy> that'd support the female...
06:02:41 <Itkovian> boegel: no, but we're bugging her with sex-topics
06:02:46 * boegel whistles
06:02:52 <earthy> anyway
06:03:05 <Itkovian> @vixen are you dumb
06:03:06 <lambdabot> yes, i am
06:03:10 <boegel> Itkovian: she's bugging herself with sex-topics, she always reacts in a way no-one imagined
06:03:12 <Philippa_> that doesn't support the female at all - everybody on the internet's a balding 40 year old guy wearing knickers, didn't you know?
06:03:13 <earthy> my print is here. (quite a bit quicker than dblhelix's stuff last friday at that :P), so I'm off to read
06:03:13 <Itkovian> @vixen are you blonde?
06:03:15 <lambdabot> yes, i am
06:03:22 <boegel> @vixen is Itkovian being an asshole?
06:03:23 <lambdabot> Im going to be a movie star.  I just applied online for this new
06:03:23 <lambdabot> movie with chris farley.  It only cost me $50!
06:03:23 <z0d> @vixen are you?
06:03:24 <Itkovian> there you go
06:03:24 <lambdabot> i truely am
06:03:29 <earthy> philippa: so, you are a balding 40 year old?
06:03:31 * shapr mutes vixen
06:03:47 <Itkovian> oh come one shapr  ...
06:03:48 <Philippa_> dblhelix: I get to spend monday mornings in bed because I'm unable to work or study. I'd happily trade
06:03:50 <earthy> that makes your statements from time to time soo much more interesting. :P
06:04:04 <boegel> Philippa_: ill?
06:04:08 <Philippa_> earthy: nobody /admits/ to being 40 and balding...
06:04:16 <Philippa_> boegel: disability :-(
06:04:18 <boegel> Philippa_: my da does
06:04:24 * earthy would. if he were. :)
06:04:25 <boegel> Philippa_: omg, what happened ?
06:04:29 <earthy> at least the balding seems to be true
06:06:21 <Philippa_> boegel: no accident or anything like that, it's congenital and psychological
06:07:32 <Philippa_> though having flat feet's not helping right now, and I don't get orthotic inserts 'til the end of the month - leaves my knees aching when I walk any distance
06:08:45 <boegel> Philippa_: you're having a depression ? or am I getting this all wrong ?
06:09:08 <Philippa_> depression tends not to be congenital. But yeah, that's one of the things I get to deal with
06:12:05 <Itkovian> ouch
06:12:11 <Itkovian> how can we cheer you up?
06:12:15 * boegel looks up congenital
06:12:33 <dblhelix> boegel: 'aangeboren'
06:13:16 <boegel> dblhelix: van dale beat you to it :p
06:13:24 <dblhelix> darn
06:13:26 * boegel pets Philippa_ 
06:13:45 <Philippa_> Itkovian: it doesn't work that way
06:13:59 <boegel> sadly enough :(
06:13:59 <Philippa_> boegel: that's a good way to get your wrist broken for you :-)
06:14:22 <Itkovian> ah well ... if there's anything ...
06:14:31 <dblhelix> Philippa_, boegel: ouch
06:14:41 <Muad_Dibler> aww
06:15:14 <boegel> Philippa_: petting you or being sad about it ?
06:15:29 <Philippa_> the petting
06:15:41 <Philippa_> well, depends what mood you catch me in etc etc etc
06:16:04 * boegel 's gf loves it when he pets her
06:16:33 <dblhelix> well, I guess that's because she's your gf
06:16:43 <Muad_Dibler> petting irl is something different than petting on irc isnt it? :P
06:17:00 <earthy> plus, if she's anything like my gf she won't like it at just any time
06:17:02 <dblhelix> boegel: you cannot just walk into an irc channel and start touching people ;)
06:17:03 <cjb> Yeah.  You get to go to *prison* for petting random people in real life.  ;-)
06:17:25 <earthy> I've been hit for trying to pet her
06:17:25 <basti_> it depends on HOW you pet
06:17:29 <Muad_Dibler> dblhelix:indeed, a good gf will forgive you most things...even hanging around uselessly on #haskell :)
06:17:42 <dblhelix> cjb: glad we just warned boegel, before he finds out about that the hard way
06:17:43 <earthy> that's PMS for ya. :P
06:18:00 <dblhelix> Muad_Dibber:  uselessly? I've never been here uselessly
06:18:16 <basti_> while petting someones shoulder might give you strange looks/black eyes maximum, petting between their legs usually counts as sexual harassment
06:18:45 <Muad_Dibler> dblhelix: @vixen...
06:18:54 * boegel pets dblhelix 
06:18:58 <earthy> basti: depends on how high on the leg
06:19:04 <basti_> yes.
06:19:17 <earthy> e.g. petting the inside of a knee you can at times get away with...
06:19:22 <dblhelix> boegel: I just hope it's on the shoulders then
06:19:32 * boegel pets dblhelix between the legs
06:19:40 <dblhelix> Muad_Dibber: I was studying AI
06:19:53 * dblhelix wants to have a shower
06:19:59 <Muad_Dibler> oh sure, how could i forget :)
06:20:07 <boegel> earthy: you've been hit by your own gf ? for being nice to her ? :)
06:20:27 <earthy> boegel: she gets *really* irritable when she hits that time of the month
06:20:34 <Philippa_> it doesn't count as nice if it makes you shudder in bad ways
06:20:46 <boegel> earthy: damn, poor guy
06:20:47 <Philippa_> or if it's intrusive when you don't want that, or...
06:20:56 <basti_> actually my gf is ALWAYS irritable. whats that, then?
06:21:13 <boegel> earthy: usually I get irriting during that time of the month ;)
06:21:25 <earthy> basti: she on anticonception pills? might be that.
06:21:28 <boegel> basti_: bitchiness ? :P
06:21:29 <basti_> ;)
06:21:37 <dblhelix> Philippa_:  but well shuddering can be taken the wrong way, I guess... well, not if the petting is on the shoulders, but...
06:21:38 <earthy> human bodies tend not to like meddling with the hormonal makeup
06:22:13 <Muad_Dibler> pfft
06:22:17 <Philippa_> dblhelix: I can usually tell when somebody's shuddering the fun way :-)
06:22:18 <basti_> thinking humans like not to accidentally reproduce, too.
06:22:43 <dblhelix> Philippa_: I like to think I can too
06:22:44 <earthy> basti_: there's other contraceptives
06:22:46 <Muad_Dibler> humans have a high mccabe complexiy, right?
06:22:52 <Muad_Dibler> if if if if then irritable
06:22:55 <basti_> earthy: do tell.
06:23:03 <boegel> basti_: yeah, never heard about condoms ? :)
06:23:09 <earthy> or spirals
06:23:21 <Philippa_> condoms on their own have a pretty significant failure rate if you're having sex regularly
06:23:23 <beelsebob_> philippa: when you give them a really cold bath?
06:23:35 <boegel> Philippa_: that's not what I heard
06:23:40 <Philippa_> beelsebob_: I was thinking of when I scratch their back
06:23:43 <basti_> boegel: but its true.
06:23:56 <dblhelix> abstention work pretty well
06:23:57 <beelsebob_> :)... that'd about do it
06:24:00 * boegel always uses two things at a time
06:24:05 <boegel> not two condoms that is :)
06:24:08 <Philippa_> it's true enough that everybody sane I know recommends using two layers if you're together for any length of time
06:24:08 <basti_> "real" PI of hormonal is <0.2 i think, while condoms are somewhere below 4
06:24:24 <Philippa_> asbtention has a massive failure rate :-)
06:24:24 <Muad_Dibler> being gay will also help as very good anticonception thingy
06:24:34 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: good point
06:24:34 <basti_> you cant pick that though
06:24:37 <beelsebob_> bwahahahaha
06:24:43 * earthy recalls a discussion with his gf and another female friend
06:24:52 <Muad_Dibler> tell us earthy :)
06:24:56 * boegel wants to hear about that discussion
06:25:03 * beelsebob_ wants to hear too
06:25:03 * basti_ doubts that he wants
06:25:16 <earthy> she stopped taking the pill, but went for a spiral, as getting a morning-after pill every two weeks was getting too annoying
06:25:17 <dblhelix> Philippa_: well the pleasure vs.safety rate tends to be a bit extreme in the case of abstention
06:25:36 <earthy> she had a *very* high condom failure rate, so to say. :P
06:25:52 <Muad_Dibler> you shouldn't bit in them earthy.
06:25:54 <beelsebob_> oops
06:25:57 <Muad_Dibler> *bite
06:26:09 <earthy> muad_dibler: if only :P
06:26:34 * dblhelix is scared again: help?!
06:26:35 <boegel> earthy: how come, was she made of rusty metal inside ?
06:26:44 <Muad_Dibler> lmao @ rusty
06:26:54 <dblhelix> boegel, I repeat: help
06:27:05 <earthy> boegel: now, what is the *one* major hole every condom has?
06:27:09 <boegel> dblhelix: you get scared easily
06:27:17 <dblhelix> how do you come up with stuff like that? and why?
06:27:20 <boegel> earthy: the entry hole ? :)
06:27:27 <earthy> what if the semen is on the wrong side of that hole, due to, e.g., the condom being in its packaging...
06:27:34 <boegel> dblhelix: huge fantasy ? :)
06:27:55 <earthy> that'd count as condom failure, no? :P
06:27:56 <boegel> :me doesn't get it
06:28:08 <boegel> s/:me/\/me
06:28:14 <dblhelix> earthy: well, you can use them more than once, that way
06:28:19 <beelsebob_> earthy: no... brain failure
06:28:23 <earthy> exactly. but they keep on failing. :P
06:28:33 <earthy> so that's why that friend went for a spiral. :)
06:29:01 <Muad_Dibler> better a spiral than to end up with 19 children.
06:29:13 <earthy> yup
06:29:21 <basti_> the bizarre thing is...
06:29:33 <basti_> that way the world starts breeding stupid humans
06:29:57 <basti_> ever observed the perl indices for highly vs. not so educated people?
06:30:18 <earthy> ever read Aldous Huxley's 'A Brave New World'?
06:30:22 <z0d> basti_: tell us
06:30:24 <basti_> yes
06:30:33 <earthy> now, apply.
06:30:35 <basti_> z0d: well most people i know don't have children.
06:30:49 <earthy> most smart people I know and like want to though
06:30:58 <basti_> z0d: and then i see those female barbers that have 3 at age 20
06:31:17 <earthy> doesn't mean the children will be stuped
06:31:19 <beelsebob_> basti: only 3?
06:31:19 <earthy> stupid, even
06:31:19 <basti_> I'd want too, but I'd first need to earn some money.
06:31:36 <earthy> anyway, there is a need for people that are willing to work the more menial jobs
06:31:40 <beelsebob_> earthy: no but genetics gives them a high chance of being if both parents are
06:31:42 <basti_> thats true
06:32:12 <z0d> not just genetics
06:32:22 <beelsebob_> yeh, memetics too
06:32:28 <basti_> heh
06:32:31 <z0d> also upbringing
06:32:36 <basti_> you mean like... 9/11 conspiracies? :D
06:32:36 <beelsebob_> earthy: not really... if there were then we wouldn't have had such things as coal miner's strikes
06:33:12 <earthy> beelsebob: that's because there's a difference between willing to do a job, and being exploited
06:34:30 <beelsebob_> earthy: no... it's to do with having no other job to go to because there's a shortage of manual labour jobs
06:34:43 <beelsebob_> the coal miner's strikes were about the mines closing
06:35:23 <Philippa_> there was the little issue of the coal towns existing entirely to mine coal though
06:35:30 <beelsebob_> true
06:35:36 <Philippa_> and nobody being able to afford moving
06:35:58 <beelsebob_> yeh... but also the whole problem of having nowhere to move to anyway
06:36:16 <Philippa_> any and everywhere with a job. But yeah, the economy wasn't in an overly fun state at the time
06:36:26 <Philippa_> right now there are a hell of a lot of menial "service" jobs going though
06:36:31 <Muad_Dibler> its funny in itself though
06:36:42 <beelsebob_> philippa: what like?
06:36:47 <Muad_Dibler> you strike, so you don't do your job out of protest of not being allowed to do your job anymore.
06:37:06 <beelsebob_> muad: no... the other miners striked when mines started closing
06:37:27 <Philippa_> beelsebob_: shop or supermarket staff, McDonalds etc etc etc
06:38:01 * SamB wonders if he should be using a more datastructural approach to instruction dispatch...
06:38:15 <beelsebob_> philippa: it's surprisingly hard to get one of those jobs (i.e. there's usually about 10 people applying, not it's difficult)... and most of them are disapearing
06:38:27 <beelsebob_> most supermarkets are introducing auto-checkouts now
06:38:58 <basti_> if work is such a scarce resource, I'm willing to give up my share.
06:39:05 <basti_> :D
06:39:15 <beelsebob_> basti: yeh.. but are you willing to give up your pay?
06:39:23 <Philippa_> there's only a couple of autos and a crapload of manned checkouts at my local, but hey
06:39:26 <boegel> Itkovian: ping
06:39:54 <basti_> well its obvious that i shouldn't have to starve
06:40:07 <beelsebob_> philippa: here, tesco introduced a couple of autos... then sainsbury's introduced 8, now tescos is ripping the place up again... I'm guessing to put more in
06:40:21 <Philippa_> it takes a bit more than not starving to keep someone healthy and sane though
06:40:51 <Muad_Dibler> yeah
06:40:56 <basti_> bread & games?
06:40:59 <Muad_Dibler> and if you just barelly not starve
06:41:01 <dblhelix> Philippa_, basti_ : a challenging job for instance
06:41:08 <Philippa_> dblhelix: something to do, certainly
06:41:16 <Muad_Dibler> how are you going to buy a new amd64 processor and another 4gig of ram for your toy computer?
06:41:48 <basti_> in the long term there will be no other possibility than less work with the same comfort, since productivity is always rising
06:42:14 <dblhelix> basti_:  I don't think it will work that way
06:42:19 <beelsebob_> basti: indeed... as is insanity
06:42:21 <basti_> but how? :D
06:42:27 <beelsebob_> strange coincidence, no?
06:42:34 <Philippa_> I'm not entirely convinced of that
06:42:42 <basti_> of what philippa?
06:42:50 <Philippa_> a lot of things we now recognise as mental illness were widely ignored in the past
06:42:59 <beelsebob_> true
06:43:02 <basti_> thats true yes
06:43:06 <dblhelix> entirely true
06:43:14 <z0d> Philippa_: like programming in PHP?
06:43:15 <Philippa_> my own condition'd be an example
06:43:26 <basti_> and the major mental illnesses are stable as long and far as statistics reach
06:43:29 <basti_> like, psychosis
06:43:30 <cjb> Philippa_: What is your condition?
06:43:39 <Philippa_> cjb: asperger's
06:43:42 <beelsebob_> cjb: nymphomania :)
06:43:52 <cjb> Philippa_: Ah, right.
06:43:57 <Philippa_> I would've been dismissed as lazy and a bad character a century ago
06:44:39 <basti_> mental diseases are a very complex topic
06:45:03 <Muad_Dibler> and maybe you will again in another century
06:45:04 <basti_> i was thinking that beelsebob was talking about systematic insanity though
06:45:07 <Philippa_> disease isn't the appropriate word in english
06:45:13 <basti_> disabilities?
06:45:19 * basti_ shrugs
06:45:50 <dblhelix> Philippa_: syndrom?
06:45:54 <Philippa_> "illness" is the most common, "disease" tends to imply infectiousness
06:45:55 <basti_> there's people who doubt that the concept makes sense at all.
06:46:12 <Philippa_> those people should live a day in my life
06:46:27 <basti_> heh
06:46:35 <basti_> i think its more of a philosophical arguemnt
06:46:56 <basti_> and aimed at psychosis anyway.
06:46:59 <Philippa_> yes. And they're still fucking up the philosophy by ignoring the possibility of the differences having value (positive or negative)
06:47:06 <boegel> Philippa_: i read somewhere that people with asperger's tent to focus on some topic...what's yours?
06:47:09 <dblhelix> Philippa_: maybe that's the problem---indeed, I can't really imagine living your life
06:47:13 <Philippa_> boegel: "systems"
06:47:31 <Philippa_> I tend to study them in the abstract, hence my presence here :-)
06:47:32 <boegel> Philippa_: elaborate
06:47:49 <dblhelix> Philippa_:  the best I can do is try, but that won't come close to really experience it
06:47:49 <boegel> so you're 'obsessed' with systems ?
06:47:49 <Philippa_> boegel: what do engineering, computer science, politics and a whole crapload more subjects have in common?
06:48:01 <Philippa_> no, I just tend to think in terms of them a lot
06:48:07 <boegel> Philippa_: weird people N :p
06:48:16 <boegel> Philippa_: doesn't everyone ?
06:48:27 <Philippa_> the 'obsession' stage is... it's sort of a developmental stage that less smart people with asperger's don't get past
06:48:32 <Muad_Dibler> Philippa_: got a quick explanation or link about asperger?
06:48:35 * cjb is obsessive but not autistic.  :)
06:48:35 <Philippa_> (though we tend to be keen on the things we're keen on)
06:48:43 <Philippa_> Muad_Dibber: nope,
06:48:49 <basti_> aspergers and other "autistic spectrum" people tend to accumulate in the tech scene ;)
06:48:51 <cjb> I guess anyone who plays Go on here has the same mindset; can't get good at that without plenty of obsession.
06:48:56 <Philippa_> and especially not one that covers more than the social and "weird" aspects of it
06:49:01 <Drakioned> afternoon folks
06:49:01 <Philippa_> basti_: all too true
06:49:14 * cjb lived with a high-functioning autist until recently.
06:49:22 <Philippa_> boegel: not everyone thinks consciously in terms of systemic behaviour
06:49:25 <boegel> Drakioned: y0
06:49:29 <cjb> (Which is the next stage on from Asperger's, I think.)
06:49:40 <boegel> Philippa_: actually, maybe I just think I do...
06:49:44 * boegel is confused
06:49:58 <Drakioned> what's happening here?
06:50:02 <Philippa_> I've never quite been clear on where they're defined. I'm not entirely sure I wouldn't be diagnosed as HFA rather than asperger's in some places now
06:50:17 <Philippa_> OTOH, I'm doing a lot better than most with it in some regards
06:50:21 <Muad_Dibler> hi pkeeken
06:50:22 <boegel> Drakioned: off-topic chat... anything you want to ask about Haskell ?
06:50:23 <cjb> I think HFA has to be severely impacting your life/job.. sounds like you're coping okay.
06:50:31 <pkeeken> hi Muad
06:50:33 <basti_> the disctinctions inside the autistic spectrum are a matter of ongoing debatee
06:50:34 <Philippa_> um. I just mentioned earlier that I'm not fit to work
06:50:36 <Drakioned> boegel, no, I'm okay thanks
06:50:47 <boegel> Drakioned: alrighty then... are you new here ?
06:50:48 <Philippa_> how much more severe do you want?
06:50:49 <cjb> Philippa_: Oh.. thought you were working, though.
06:50:59 <Drakioned> boegel, yeah, kinda
06:51:13 <boegel> Muad_Dibber: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_Syndrome
06:51:19 <basti_> we should make #haskell-blah.
06:51:22 <Philippa_> I've a couple of projects of my own that get some attention once in a while, and I may or may not manage to study part-time sometime in the next year
06:51:26 <boegel> Drakioned: and you're sure there's nothing you want to ask ?
06:51:41 <cjb> Oh, okay; I thought you shared an office with someone on here, for some reason.
06:51:51 <Muad_Dibler> sup pkeeken, still wokring on your thesis?
06:52:01 <boegel> Drakioned: have you had the famous tour ?
06:52:04 <pkeeken> yeah, as usual
06:52:06 <pkeeken> you?
06:52:12 <Drakioned> the famous tour?
06:52:12 <boegel> pkeeken: subject ?
06:52:19 <boegel> Drakioned: yeah, the Haskell tour
06:52:27 <Drakioned> no, I haven't
06:52:40 <Drakioned> wasn't aware of such a thing
06:53:02 <Muad_Dibler> pkeeken: reading through the networked objects book so i can start creating my presentation before friday :P
06:53:03 <boegel> well, here we go then :)
06:53:18 <Drakioned> ...?
06:53:22 <boegel> Drakioned: first of all, there's haskell.org , the main source of haskell related stuff
06:53:31 <Philippa_> cjb: I know some of the folks at UoN's FoP group
06:53:37 <Drakioned> okay, that I know.
06:53:44 <boegel> Drakioned: this includes the Haskell wiki, with lot's of cool stuff on it (haskell.org/hawiki)
06:54:08 <shapr> Lemmih: snowblind is online, not sure if everything is working though.
06:54:15 <boegel> Drakioned: next, there's TMR, the Haskell magazine which has 4 issues until now, and is growing fast
06:54:28 <Drakioned> TMR?
06:54:32 <Lemmih> shapr: Great.
06:54:32 <Drakioned> link?
06:54:47 <boegel> Drakioned: yeah, The Monad.Read (haskell.org/tmrwiki)
06:54:48 * Lemmih just ran a parsec parser on a FastString.
06:55:13 <shapr> The Monad.Reader
06:55:19 <boegel> Drakioned: then there's this channel, packed with smart Haskell people
06:55:23 <Philippa_> btw, that article on Asperger's misses out an important set of common problems: so-called impaired "higher executive functions", which means problems with things like motivating yourself to do things
06:55:27 * shapr cheers boegel's tour!
06:55:34 <boegel> Drakioned: oh, yeah, The Monad.Reader, sorry about that :)
06:55:51 * shapr goes back to fixing ScannedInAvian.org
06:55:52 <boegel> Drakioned: in this channel, there's lambdabot, a powerfull and smart _female_ bot :)
06:55:59 <boegel> Drakioned: for example
06:56:02 <boegel> @type map
06:56:04 <Philippa_> it also doesn't really press home the high likelihood of someone with it undergoing experience that pretty much amount to abuse (bullying's not the only such example)
06:56:04 <Drakioned> that's the one that does @eval?
06:56:10 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
06:56:15 <boegel> Drakioned: yep, along with other stuff
06:56:25 <boegel> @hoogle a -> [b] ->
06:56:27 <lambdabot> hoogle: Maybe.fromJust: Nothing
06:56:27 <lambdabot>  
06:56:28 <boegel> @hoogle a -> [b] -> a
06:56:30 <lambdabot> List.genericIndex :: Integral a => [b] -> a -> b
06:56:30 <lambdabot> Prelude.(^) :: (Num a, Integral b) => a -> b -> a
06:56:30 <lambdabot> Prelude.const :: a -> b -> a
06:56:37 <boegel> @y0w
06:56:38 <lambdabot> I'm EMOTIONAL now because I have MERCHANDISING CLOUT!!
06:56:43 * shapr hugs lambdabot
06:57:29 <boegel> Drakioned: before I forget, there's shapr, the human Haskell index
06:57:48 <boegel> he's know a something about every single Haskell project
06:58:31 <boegel> Drakioned: last but not least, there's the Haskell mailing lists, including haskell@haskell.org and haskell-cafe@haskell.org
06:58:44 <boegel> basti_: hehe ;)
06:58:49 <TNKS> hi all.  I think an efficient binomial coeff / choose function should exist already, but I'm not sure what it is.
06:58:54 <TNKS> or what library it's in.
06:58:59 <dcoutts> xerox, ping!
06:59:08 <boegel> @type binom
06:59:11 <lambdabot> bzzt
06:59:19 * Muad_Dibler sees shapr's ego grow :)
06:59:20 <boegel> @google Haskell binomial
06:59:22 <lambdabot> http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=871896
06:59:44 <boegel> TNKS: hmm, nevermind :)
07:00:09 <boegel> Drakioned: enough info for you ? I might have forgotten something, but you always come in here and ask away, we're glad to help
07:00:15 <boegel> aren't we basti_ ? yes we are :)
07:00:23 * basti_ nodnodnods
07:00:27 <Muad_Dibler> yes boegel always is. :)
07:00:35 <basti_> though sometimes there's strange discussions going on
07:00:47 <basti_> if it's about sex, it's almost certainly Philippa's fault, one way or the other.
07:00:59 <Philippa_> hey, I keep getting asked why I /didn't/ join in conversations about it...
07:01:04 <basti_> :D
07:01:05 <basti_> see!
07:01:07 <boegel> Philippa_: do you have an imagenary friend too ?
07:01:13 <Philippa_> boegel: nope, never did
07:01:21 <xerox> dcoutts: pong!
07:01:22 <boegel> Philippa_: okay, just wondering
07:01:23 <dcoutts> @where hackage
07:01:24 <lambdabot> I know nothing about hackage.
07:01:26 * cjb did.  :)
07:01:27 <dcoutts> xerox, with your permission I'd like to use your lsystem cairo demo at a university open day this Friday to show off Haskell to prospective students (17/18 year olds)
07:01:35 <boegel> I've always wanted to know how that's like
07:01:36 <Philippa_> no damn point, you're still only playing with yourself
07:01:41 <basti_> maybe some people just not ever notice that he's imaginary.
07:01:44 <boegel> I liked the movie 'a beautiful mind'
07:01:44 <basti_> ;)
07:02:03 <boegel> dcoutts: w00 !
07:02:05 <dblhelix> but, Philippa_, did you already know lambdabot is female (perhaps the two of you did some girly talk already)? and how do you feel not being the only girl around here anymore?
07:02:06 * cjb liked playing with him.. hm, no, I don't want to say that.
07:02:35 <Philippa_> I did have a habit at one point of holding arguments with myself in my own head, on the whole I'm probably glad I don't do that any more but it could be useful for getting to the bottom of some problems
07:02:54 <Philippa_> dblhelix: There've been other women in here on occasion
07:02:54 <dcoutts> xerox, boegel: for one thing it's quite fun to make our IT people scramble to setup a linux box with gtk+ 2.8 and cairo on it within 4 days :-)
07:03:27 <beelsebob_> philippa: arguments in my head are fun... and they do help sort shit out
07:03:35 <xerox> dcoutts: I have a new version nearly finished here
07:03:40 <beelsebob_> but yeh, sometimes they're quite anoying
07:03:41 <Philippa_> yeah. The "how did I fuck that situation up?" ones less so, though
07:03:42 <dcoutts> xerox, cool
07:03:55 <xerox> dcoutts: the LSystem code is even cooler (thanks Cale!)
07:04:04 <xerox> The GUI one is what I was stuck at :-)
07:04:13 <beelsebob_> philippa: hah, yes... Perhaps the most common of all
07:04:14 <xerox> Also I wrote a parser.
07:04:33 <dcoutts> xerox, nice
07:04:36 <Muad_Dibler> but no other girl that wanted to date me, right dblhelix; Philippa_... :)
07:04:58 <Philippa_> Muad_Dibler: there are... risks associated with that :-)
07:05:30 <Muad_Dibler> we had that discussion earlier already
07:05:36 * Drakioned waves at Philippa
07:05:37 * boegel thinks he should add some info about this on his HaskLS page
07:05:57 * Philippa_ particles Drakioned
07:06:01 <boegel> which is quite dead now, since mostly xerox is hacking on it :) mine is quite useless now ;)
07:06:09 * shapr boings furiously
07:06:26 <Drakioned> particles?
07:06:33 <xerox> :-D
07:07:02 * Drakioned scatters into a million particles, connected using a binary tree.
07:07:15 <Philippa_> Drakioned: you didn't do much physics, I take it?
07:07:16 * basti_ intruduces a third value.
07:07:26 <beelsebob_> philippa: damn you... you've started a chain reaction
07:07:33 * beelsebob_ scatters into a million particles
07:07:42 <Muad_Dibler> oh
07:07:44 <dblhelix> mmm, somehow Philippa is more lenient towards petting than towards waving
07:07:44 <Drakioned> only A-level.
07:07:52 * Muad_Dibler brings out the ducktape and fixes beelsebob_ together
07:07:55 * Philippa_ harnesses the unleashed power to make toast
07:07:59 <dblhelix> I mean, boegel only got his wrist broken
07:08:06 <beelsebob_> thanks maud
07:08:12 <Philippa_> dblhelix: old physics joke. Wave/particle duality.
07:08:22 <beelsebob_> mmm... radioactive toast
07:08:25 <Drakioned> ahh
07:08:38 <Drakioned> that wasn't immediately obvious to me..
07:08:42 <cbus> Thinking of Maud you forget everything else.
07:08:49 <basti_> lol
07:08:55 <cbus> nethack :)
07:08:55 <Muad_Dibler> ..
07:09:00 <dblhelix> Philippa_: ah, I get it ... so we still wave rather than pet
07:09:04 <Drakioned> nethack, people still play that?
07:09:08 <basti_> cbus: was addicted to that once
07:09:09 <cbus> drakioned, ofcourse we do
07:09:31 <Philippa_> somebody did a roguelike based on Doom
07:09:32 <cbus> basti_, ascended? :)
07:09:36 <basti_> nope.
07:09:38 <cbus> philippa_, rotfl
07:09:40 <Drakioned> I heard it mentioned on UF so often
07:09:50 <basti_> ~lvl 40 was my maximum achievement
07:09:56 <cbus> oki
07:09:58 * beelsebob_ goes away to play iPod doom
07:09:59 <cbus> so not gotten the amulet?
07:10:14 <Drakioned> the real or the fake Amulet of Yendor?
07:10:17 * dblhelix doesn't play
07:10:19 <cbus> real :)
07:10:20 <basti_> no
07:11:04 <cbus> great game
07:11:29 <cbus> we have an ascension race at school since they cleared the high score ;)
07:11:39 <cbus> time to start playing again
07:17:10 * boegel is feeling lonely in #haskell-blah
07:17:16 <basti_> hey you kicked me
07:17:19 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ping
07:17:26 <Lemmih> dcoutts: pong.
07:17:59 <dcoutts> Lemmih, is there any chance you could give the gnupg package a less generic name? it's going to clash with the gnupg in our distro packaing?
07:18:07 <dcoutts> ?//
07:18:29 <Lemmih> Sure.
07:18:39 <boegel> basti_: and now I'm inviting you back
07:20:17 <dcoutts> Lemmih, for us it'll end up as dev-haskell/gnupg, but since people normally don't use the fully qualified version, when they say emerge gnupg they'll get told that there is both dev-haskell/gnupg and sys-whatever/gnupg. And that'll make the gentoo users and other developers shout as us for using too generic a name. :-)
07:21:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so we can rename your package but if it's not to much trouble it'd save confsion if you could rename it at source.
07:22:15 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so can packages have differnt package names to their cabal name? eg what about the xmp-rpc thing?
07:22:46 <shapr> Ah stupid question, what creates /home/$USER/Maildir ?
07:23:03 <boegel> shapr: pine ?
07:23:06 <z0d> shapr: a maildir enabled SMTP process?
07:23:13 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Package name? The filename of the tarball?
07:23:15 <boegel> ndm: please leave the blah channel
07:23:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, since xmlrpc got renamed to haxr but the cabal name is still "XmlRpc"
07:23:19 <shapr> I dunno, I have a ~/Maildir/ and other users don't
07:23:27 <z0d> shapr: check your muttrc <-:
07:23:38 <dcoutts> Lemmih, see http://www.haskell.org/haxr/
07:23:52 <shapr> I don't use mutt, pine, or other client. I just download via fetchmail via IMAP.
07:24:20 <Itkovian> shapr: and you read it using less?
07:24:26 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Hackage doesn't care how the tarball is named.
07:24:32 <z0d> shapr: then most probably fetchmail
07:24:51 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so http://www.haskell.org/haxr/download/haxr-20050621.tar.gz contains xmlrpc.cabal which claims it's called "XmlRpc"
07:25:04 <dcoutts> it's all very inconsistent :-(
07:25:17 * boegel swears at ndm
07:25:32 * beelsebob_ wonders why
07:25:46 <ndm> boegel, i have left....
07:26:12 <Igloo> What's a package name if not a cabal name?
07:26:20 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok the thing is we're not sure what to call our package. xmlrpc or haxr.
07:26:33 <dblhelix> boegel: are you enjoying yourself in your own little channel?
07:26:34 <Igloo> cabal names are case insensitive IIRC, BWT
07:26:37 <dcoutts> Igloo, what would you package it as? http://www.haskell.org/haxr/
07:26:43 <boegel> ndm: no you haven't
07:26:44 <Lemmih> Hackage will call it XmlRpc.
07:27:07 <boegel> dblhelix: I'm trying to get op status back
07:27:14 <dcoutts> Lemmih, right, we're not sure what users will expect it to be called
07:27:17 <Igloo> We use names matching what the impls call it for binary packages
07:27:23 <dblhelix> who's taken it from you then, boegel?
07:27:27 <ndm> boegel, yes i did - i just restarted my irc channel
07:27:30 <ndm> *client
07:27:35 <boegel> dblhelix: nobody, I left :)
07:27:41 <boegel> ndm, thanks, it's ok now
07:27:42 <dcoutts> Igloo, but what does the impl call it in this case? it's open to debate :-)
07:27:47 <boegel> Philippa_: got op status back !
07:27:56 <Igloo> The impl calls it whatever -package flag you need, or equivalent
07:28:06 <Igloo> Or what goes in other cabal files to depend on it
07:28:16 <Igloo> Otherwise we couldn't automatically work out deps
07:28:48 <dcoutts> Igloo, indeed we'd need a distributable package name <-> cabal package name mapping
07:29:21 <Igloo> So pick distributable package names such that the mapping is id and make things easier on yourself  :-)
07:29:23 <dcoutts> Lemmih, once there are multiple .cabal files per package we'll probably need a concept of distributable name that is distince from the .cabal name anyway (no?)
07:29:24 <ndm> hmm, it appears Chatzilla doesn't disconnect when you leave a channel, how odd...
07:29:55 <Muad_Dibler> that isnt odd is it?
07:29:56 <dcoutts> Igloo, so you'd call it "xmlrpc" even though the developers clearly call it "haxr"
07:30:05 <Igloo> What is "it"?
07:30:12 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Yeah.
07:30:13 <dcoutts> http://www.haskell.org/haxr/
07:30:31 <Igloo> The xmlrpc cabal package will be in the lib{ghc6,nhc98,hugs}-xmlrpc-dev Debian binary packages
07:31:45 <Igloo> The source package could reasonably be any of {,haskell-}{haxr,xmlrpc} or perhaps other things, AFAICT, but that's not hugely important
07:32:02 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so we'll need a distributable name <-> cabal name mapping anyway
07:32:03 <dcoutts> and it'll be one to many
07:33:07 <dcoutts> Igloo, because you'll be able to have one source package produce many binary packages, one for each .cabal file
07:33:18 * boegel presents the famous (?) #haskell-blah channel, for all your non-haskell related bull shit
07:33:21 <boegel> feel free to join
07:33:22 * Lemmih will let SyntaxNinja worry about the design details.
07:33:31 <dcoutts> and so the source and binary package names need not be related
07:37:45 <shapr> It seems that sysadmins should create ~/Maildir for users. I did not know this.
07:37:57 <shapr> It also seems that Exim probably does it automatically, and postfix doesn't
07:41:05 <z0d> shapr: my postfix creates them automatically
07:41:43 <shapr> I've hacked up my config file greatly, so I probably turned it off somewhere.
07:42:19 <shapr> aha, postfix won't create Maildirs in a world readable dir.
07:53:01 <dcoutts> Lemmih, when cabal supports multiple .cabal files in a distrbutable, it'd be nice if hackage would mainting the distributable<->{pkg1.cabal, pkg2.cabal, ...} mapping. Anyway, cabal-get would need that info too.
07:53:34 <dcoutts> Lemmih, actually this whole idea of multiple .cabal packages in one distributable is a pain. It really complicates things.
08:20:24 <eyck> whoa, what a funky little #
08:24:24 <shapr> eyck: huh?
08:24:31 <shapr> eyck: Are you learning Haskell?
08:25:24 <dcoutts> shapr is on #haskell newbie duty again :-)
08:26:37 <dcoutts> shapr, thinking of IDEs... have you seen this: http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2005/09/12/pivotal-prototype-uses-gtk2hs/
08:26:56 <dcoutts> http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/pivotal
08:27:15 <shapr> nifty!
08:27:42 <dcoutts> it's quite interactive
08:28:08 <dcoutts> my first impression was that strip out the cool graphcs aspect of it and it has many good ideas for an IDE
08:28:20 <dcoutts> ie no edit/save/reload cycle
08:28:33 <dcoutts> just edit and evaluate
08:28:54 <Igloo> shapr: Can I ask you to install things like vim on haskell.org, or should I e-mail Paul for that?
08:29:15 <dcoutts> and don't require the whole module to compile to be able to use values/func defined in it
08:29:25 <Igloo> shapr: And did you look in /var/log/httpd when looking for the wiki failure thing in logs?
08:29:36 <shapr> Igloo: If you'll tell me the recommended package management flavor, I'll have a go.
08:29:56 <shapr> Igloo: Yes, that's the first place I looked. After that I checked the moin error logs. There's nothing about it in either place.
08:30:24 <dcoutts> shapr, sudo apt-get install
08:30:37 <shapr> fair enough
08:30:39 <dcoutts> shapr, that's how I installed mysql
08:31:04 <dcoutts> shapr, and there's apt-cache to query for available rpms
08:31:17 <shapr> Igloo: Is vim-minimal sufficient?
08:31:42 <Igloo> That's probably missing things like syntax highlighting
08:32:09 <dcoutts> vim-enhanced
08:32:30 <dcoutts> $ apt-cache search vim
08:32:34 <dcoutts> vim-X11 - The VIM version of the vi editor for the X Window System.
08:32:34 <dcoutts> vim-common - The common files needed by any version of the VIM editor.
08:32:34 <dcoutts> vim-enhanced - A version of the VIM editor which includes recent enhancements.
08:32:34 <dcoutts> vim-minimal - A minimal version of the VIM editor.
08:32:38 <shapr> Igloo: vim-enhanced installed
08:32:48 <Igloo> Cool, thanks!
08:32:56 <shapr> Any other haskell.org sysadmin requests?
08:33:08 <dcoutts> shapr, latest darcs & ghc? :-)
08:33:20 <shapr> The latest ghc isn't on haskell.org??
08:33:32 <Igloo> No ghc is, it seems
08:33:34 <dcoutts> $ ghc --version
08:33:34 <dcoutts> -bash: ghc: command not found
08:33:37 <Igloo> Nor hugs
08:33:49 <dcoutts> I've got a local binary copy of darcs
08:33:50 <Igloo> I can hear its poor CPU weeping from here
08:34:02 <shapr> Neither ghc nor hugs show up in apt.
08:34:12 * shapr wants a real Debian installation.
08:34:22 <Igloo> "Why doth though torment me with your imperative code!", it wails
08:34:26 <dcoutts> there is a /usr/local instllation of darce 1.0.3
08:35:06 <shapr> Should I ask for haskell.org to switch to Debian? I think most people just don't care one way or the other.
08:35:19 <shapr> iirc, the yale sysadmins use redhat by default, that's how we got this.
08:35:36 <dcoutts> shapr, I don't know, I've not had any realy problems with what they've got
08:35:48 <Igloo> Asking a few weeks ago would probably have been better, but n/m  :-)
08:36:02 <dcoutts> having ghc would obviously be good though
08:36:23 <shapr> heh
08:37:04 <dcoutts> though it could be argues that we should build software elsewhare (ie darcs)
08:37:14 <dcoutts> and then copy it over
08:38:08 <Igloo> Sounds silly to me
08:38:10 <dcoutts> so ghc perhaps is not so important, the only thing the projects that I host on haskell.org require is darcs
08:39:03 <dcoutts> Igloo, well if you're going to build software remember to nice it :-)
08:42:45 <shapr> I'm getting tired of moin, I just cleaned up several gb of log files. I vote we switch to Flippi, and then lazily evaluate needed features.
08:43:45 <Igloo> dcoutts: If you build it elsewhere you have to worry about library versions etc
08:44:14 * Igloo votes we switch to a decent wiki with a darcslib backend
08:45:00 <Igloo> (the implementation is left as an exercise ot the reader)
08:49:42 <dcoutts> Igloo, good point, kosmikus did a static build of darcs I believe
08:50:01 <dcoutts> $ ldd /usr/local/bin/darcs
08:50:01 <dcoutts>         not a dynamic executable
08:50:21 <dcoutts> yeah, that's a pain
08:50:42 <dcoutts> ok shapr, we want ghc on haskell.org :-)
08:50:56 <shapr> Are there rpms or something?
08:51:41 <dcoutts> there are rpms for fedora, not sure if they'd work for RHEL AS 3
08:51:50 <dcoutts> you could akk juhp
08:52:06 <dcoutts> juhp, ping
09:00:44 <Cale> hmm... RecentChanges is gone - oh, you're switching the wiki?
09:01:00 <basti_> hmm.
09:01:06 <basti_> installed a new version of Cabal
09:01:14 <basti_>     (Cabal-1.0), (Cabal-0.6), Cabal-1.1.2
09:01:21 <basti_> (ghc-pkg output)
09:01:27 <basti_> Error: module 'Distribution.Compat.RawSystem' is exposed by package Cabal-1.0 and package Cabal-1.1.2 though
09:01:30 <basti_> WTF?
09:02:24 <Cale> perhaps you need to uninstall previous versions?
09:02:39 <basti_> like how? i thought hiding them was enough?
09:03:11 <basti_> "unregister"?
09:03:32 <basti_> oh okay
09:03:32 <Cale> perhaps, (I don't really know much about cabal though)
09:03:33 <basti_> that worked
09:03:36 <Cale> okay :)
09:03:40 <basti_> bizarre
09:03:47 <basti_> what is hiding for, then=
09:03:47 <basti_> ?
09:03:54 <Cale> not sure
09:05:22 <Igloo> That's probably a bug. I think 6.4 has some known deficiencies in that area
09:05:26 <dcoutts> basti_, ghc 6.4 is not good about dealing with multiple versions of packages
09:05:30 <dcoutts> 6.4.1 will be better
09:05:36 <dcoutts> (we hope)
09:05:53 <erpat> hello, n00b here... is there a escape character for chars with umlauts?
09:05:56 <erpat> im using hugs
09:05:59 <basti_> dcoutts: ic
09:06:27 <dcoutts> in fact ghc 6.4 cannot build itself if you've installed a later version of cabal
09:06:47 <dcoutts> because you then have two versions installed
09:07:12 <musasabi> ghc 6.4 cannot build ghc 6.5 either then.
09:08:27 <basti_> @where trhsx
09:08:28 <lambdabot> I know nothing about trhsx.
09:08:33 <basti_> does anyone?
09:08:49 <musasabi> yes, haskell-src-exts
09:08:54 <basti_> oh
09:08:56 <basti_> i got that already
09:09:09 <musasabi> @google trhsx haskell
09:09:10 <lambdabot> http://www.mail-archive.com/glasgow-haskell-users@haskell.org/msg08399.html
09:09:18 <musasabi> hmm no such luck
09:09:25 <Cale> erpat: you can't just use the actual characters?
09:09:40 <musasabi> I managed to kill my hd today, so no browsers or links.
09:10:05 * basti_ building

09:11:05 <erpat> Cale, im using hugs on debian... but i think made it work right before
09:11:45 <Cale> erpat: odd, let me try :)
09:12:29 <erpat> Cale, this is on hugs 20050308
09:12:35 <erpat> ghci doesnt complain
09:12:37 <erpat> weird

09:13:31 <basti_> Lemmih: & hswebforms, then
09:13:42 <Cale> hmm...
09:13:58 <Cale> hugs works for me with characters with accents at least
09:15:26 <erpat> Cale, im trying to do something with sms... so the 'u' smileys are out... =) anyways... il just be using ghci on my linux install... i only got hugs in win32. no space for ghc on my drive. anyways thanks for the help. =)

09:16:42 <Cale> erpat: it even works with kanji and katakana
09:17:19 <Cale> erpat: might have something to do with the terminal that you're running it from or the editor you're using
09:17:28 <Cale> make sure that it's encoded in UTF-8
09:18:07 <erpat> hmmm... ic. will try doing that.
09:19:14 <basti_> UTF-8 should be Char8 transparent.
09:19:14 <basti_> ;)
09:19:32 <basti_> nearly, that is.
09:19:44 <basti_> wtf is wrong with sf cvs again?
09:20:15 <Cale> (and hiragana too, for that matter :)
09:21:56 <erpat> i guess theres something wrong with my setup... cant seem to fix this yet. anyways. tnx everyone.. i gotta get some sleep now. =)

09:30:07 <Lemmih> Hi SyntaxNinja.
09:32:14 <SyntaxNinja> hi Lemmih
09:32:33 <basti_> whats ReadParameterL besides a function that's called from hswebpages that isn't in scope?
09:32:56 <Lemmih> Try grepping it.
09:33:04 <basti_> i did
09:33:14 <basti_> turned up nothing besides the call
09:33:18 <dcoutts> hi SyntaxNinja
09:33:45 <Lemmih> basti_: Try grepping it in musasabi's version of HSP.
09:33:59 <basti_> hmmm
09:34:08 <ProfTeggy> Bye all.
09:34:10 <basti_> i darcs got that from the reference of musa's page
09:35:15 <basti_> is there any later one?
09:35:49 <Lemmih> It wasn't mentioned in HSP either?
09:36:18 <basti_> no
09:36:27 <basti_> are you suggesting i should get a newer version of that?
09:37:52 <basti_> or maybe musa's modified version of it? :D
09:38:12 <basti_> ahh
09:38:16 <basti_> its even written on the page
09:38:24 <basti_> sorry, got lost with that many packages

09:53:52 <Lemmih> Grr. Someone messed up the wiki.
09:54:01 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: spam?
09:57:48 <Lemmih> Yeah, and moinmoin crashes when I try to access the revision history /-:
10:03:35 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: What do you think of CabalFind, btw?
10:05:09 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: seems cool.  I haven't tried it yet.
10:05:20 <SyntaxNinja> I like the idea, though.  I should follow up to that email.
10:18:05 <rafl> Can you please point me to some simple documentation about writing command line parsers? I'm quite new to haskell.
10:23:59 <Igloo> rafl: System.Console.GetOpt is one way
10:25:34 <rafl> Currently I do args <- getArgs. I now want to check if a string starting with '--foo' is in args. If yes, and the string is exactly --foo i'd like to take the next string in the list and put it into some variable.
10:25:55 <rafl> If the string looks like --foo=bar it should put bar into that variable.
10:26:17 <rafl> In any case --foo and it's argument should be removed from args and the rest should be untouched.
10:27:57 <dcoutts> rafl, there are libs for dealing with this
10:28:30 <dcoutts> as Igloo said. I don't know how well documented it is, but you can look at some other programs for examples.
10:29:11 <Igloo> There's an example on http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System.Console.GetOpt.html
10:30:10 * rafl tries
10:30:40 <dcoutts> eg the cabal source code is a nice example: http://cvs.haskell.org/darcs/cabal/Distribution/Setup.hs
10:30:51 <dcoutts> though admitidly it's a rather complex example
10:31:05 <dcoutts> since cabal has bucket loads of options
10:57:22 <hackerteam> how can I concat a [a] and Maybe [a] into Maybe [a]? Nothing should be considered as an empty string
10:58:17 <Muad_Dibler> string?
10:58:20 <rafl> What means the following ghc error? Misplaced type signature: Builder :: Maybe String -> String
10:58:54 <ndm> hackerteam, catMaybes
10:59:08 <Igloo> Functions have to start with a lowercase letter
10:59:51 <ndm> its not quite right, but its probably close enough to use to compose up
11:00:12 <Igloo> IIUC fromMaybe [] is actually what you want
11:00:29 <int-e> @type maybe
11:00:38 <lambdabot> forall b a. b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
11:00:43 <Muad_Dibler> or write concatMaybe Nothing as = Just as
11:01:01 <Muad_Dibler> concatMaybe (Just as') as = Just (as' ++ as)
11:01:03 <ndm> oh, didn't know about fromMaybe
11:01:27 <Igloo> Oh, given the return type the question actually makes no sense to me at all
11:01:29 <ndm> thats definately what you want
11:01:36 <ndm> i guess he means
11:01:45 <ndm> f :: [a] -> Maybe [a] -> [a]
11:01:51 <hackerteam> can you give an example please?
11:01:56 <ndm> (i assume the return type is just wrong)
11:01:59 <musasabi> maybeCat = concatMap (maybe id [])
11:02:40 <int-e> musasabi: maybe [] id
11:02:50 <musasabi> int-e: point.
11:02:56 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, is there any chance we could get another cabal snapshot tarball out? We'd like to start using it in Gentoo. We're relying on a couple of the fixes in 1.1.2 over the latest release with a tarball which is 1.1.1
11:04:39 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah, probably. what are you looking for?
11:04:41 <SyntaxNinja> er, using?
11:05:40 <hackerteam> if x is [a] and z is Maybe [a], how do I concat them into a new Maybe [a]? ideally, i'd like to convert z into [a], concat it with x and then convert the result of ++ into Maybe [a] again..
11:06:16 <int-e> hackerteam: what should f [1] Nothing be?
11:06:35 <hackerteam> f?
11:06:39 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, http://haskell.org/cabal/release/rc/cabal-1.1.2.tar.gz perhaps
11:06:49 <int-e> hackerteam: your function
11:06:50 <ndm> assuming f is the function you are defining
11:06:57 <hackerteam> if z is Nothing, i'd like it to return []
11:07:07 <ndm> and what should f [] Nothing be?
11:07:25 <hackerteam> i'm not sure what you're talking about
11:07:31 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: I mean, what new features are you using?
11:07:33 <SyntaxNinja> or bugfixes
11:07:37 <ndm> shouldn't f [1] Nothing be either [1] or Nothing? [] doesn't make much sense...
11:07:56 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, the ghci bits and something else I can't quite remember
11:08:35 <SyntaxNinja> ghci bits?
11:08:46 <SyntaxNinja> oh where ot generate libs
11:08:50 <dcoutts> the thing to build ghci libs during build rather than register
11:08:58 <dcoutts> yep
11:09:06 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, I'm wanting to use the new hooks at work, so a release would be good.
11:09:43 <Igloo> Oh, you want (fmap . (++)) I think
11:09:52 <dcoutts> we're planning to get a whole bunch of cabalised ebuilds out of our private testing tree and out into the public portage tree
11:11:02 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: OK. I'll maybe even do that tonight... we'll see.
11:11:10 <dcoutts> Lemmih, you might be interested to know that we've started writing a tool that uses the hackage server and the hackage-client library package to generate ebuilds
11:11:13 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, ok great
11:11:45 <SyntaxNinja> no one has uploaded a package to cabal-put. can't get beta testers :(
11:11:55 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Neat.
11:12:05 <int-e> @eval let f = (fmap . (++)) in (f [1] (Just [2]), f [42] Nothing)
11:12:09 <lambdabot> (Just [1,2],Nothing)
11:12:16 <Igloo> Is cabal-put packaged for Debian yet?
11:12:34 <dcoutts> we've not packaged it yet either
11:12:49 <hackerteam> hackerteams says good bye!
11:12:49 <SickJacken> this is the first time haskell is depressing me with memory issues
11:12:52 <SickJacken> bleh
11:13:14 <Heffalump> SickJacken: what's the problem?
11:13:25 * SickJacken spits on haskell from frustration
11:13:44 <SickJacken> i posted it to the ghc-users....its the thread about 'profiling not showing it all ?'
11:13:45 <Muad_Dibler> .!!
11:13:45 * Igloo is going to get around to seeing if my lcs packages still builds and putting that at some point, as well as splitting off some bits of bark, but I'm more likely to do so if it's packaged  :-)
11:13:50 <SickJacken> i cant even run my app on my pc
11:13:53 <SickJacken> because it uses all the mem
11:13:54 <musasabi> you just have to be strict with it.
11:13:58 <Muad_Dibler> no spitting around here :P
11:14:14 <SickJacken> but here it comes...on ANOTHER host with THE SAME binary...it only takes 188mb
11:14:19 <SickJacken> now WHAT the hell is that about
11:16:09 <Igloo> You mean you just copy the binary across and the memory usage triples according to top?
11:16:34 <Igloo> What does ldd say, if so?
11:17:43 <SickJacken> yes, i copied the bin, executed on another host on the same test file etc...suddenly it uses 1gig of swap memory and 450mb real memory vs 188mb
11:20:15 <musasabi> SickJacken: are you sure that is not an OS issue?
11:21:02 <SickJacken> both linux
11:21:09 <SickJacken> how could it be an OS issue musasabi ?
11:21:17 <SickJacken> maybe it is but i dont know how it could be
11:21:28 <SickJacken> Igloo, what do you want to see from the ldd output?
11:21:44 <int-e> lisppaste2: url
11:21:44 <lisppaste2> To use the lisppaste bot, visit http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell and enter your paste.
11:21:52 <Igloo> All of it
11:21:53 <int-e> SickJacken: best paste it there :)
11:21:54 <Heffalump> libgmp would be most interesting.
11:21:59 <musasabi> SickJacken: well if it uses 188mb vs 1.5gb then it sounds like there is a crucial difference with the machines.
11:22:04 <Heffalump> but yeah, all of it is probably useful
11:22:17 <int-e> SickJacken: and preferably for both hosts.
11:22:30 <musasabi> If the app has massive multithreading then NPTL makes a difference.
11:22:43 <SickJacken> its an attribute grammar doing analysis
11:22:50 <SickJacken> not multithreaded stuff
11:22:51 <Heffalump> but that could only happen with ghc -threaded, presumably
11:22:55 * SickJacken pasting the ldd output atm
11:23:04 <Heffalump> SickJacken: you're not at Utrecht, are you? :-)
11:23:28 <SickJacken> Heffalump, hehe not fysically
11:23:49 <Muad_Dibler> but mentally you are? :)
11:24:10 <Heffalump> surely that follows from "Dutchman doing AGs"? :-)
11:25:04 <Muad_Dibler> its mostly Utrecht people doing AG anyway, righ?
11:25:58 <lisppaste2> SickJacken pasted "mem" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/11619
11:26:07 <SickJacken> http://paste.lisp.org/display/11619
11:26:16 <SickJacken> ow lol, it messages automatically to this chan
11:26:17 <SickJacken> sweet
11:26:39 <SickJacken> mentally, im all at UU Muad_Dibber :)
11:26:57 <int-e> tls. 2.6 vs. 2.4 kernel (I guess) ... hmm.
11:27:10 * int-e doesn't know what consequences that has.
11:27:15 <Muad_Dibler> SickJacken: you work/study there?
11:27:17 <SickJacken> ow yeah, the amd machine has a debian 2.6 kernel
11:27:25 <Heffalump> oh, amd. 64 bit?
11:27:34 <SickJacken> no, athlon xp 2200+
11:27:50 <SickJacken> the other is a pentium 4 2.33 Ghz with some other linux
11:27:58 <SickJacken> Muad_Dibber, im student there
11:28:34 <Muad_Dibler> SickJacken: just wondering if i know you :P
11:29:26 <SickJacken> i was previously known as the dude with the day of the week + random nr :)
11:30:26 <Muad_Dibler> .. :)
11:31:14 <SickJacken> anyone able to make anything out of those ldd outputs?
11:31:18 <SickJacken> http://paste.lisp.org/display/11619
11:31:58 <musasabi> SickJacken: the kernel difference.
11:32:06 <int-e> SickJacken: the differences look harmless enough; otoh they are big enough to cause unpredictable results. it's strange.
11:32:44 <SickJacken> musasabi, that would be an amazing difference
11:32:55 <SickJacken> is that a hunch or did you infer that off the ldd outputs?
11:33:10 <int-e> SickJacken: it's visible in the ldd output
11:33:36 <int-e> SickJacken: linux-gate.so.1 is actually mapped by the kernel and is used to contain a syscall trampoline.
11:34:15 <int-e> SickJacken: and that's a 2.6 kernel feature.
11:34:37 <musasabi> SickJacken: my next try would be for both cat /proc/<pid>/maps or "strace -e mmap -e signal=" or somesuch.
11:35:25 <SickJacken> wow i actually didnt understood anything in those two sentences :D
11:35:56 <Muad_Dibler> lol
11:36:34 <SickJacken> i dont think i want to know what a syscall trampoline is :P
11:37:04 <SickJacken> how can i see the kernel version again?
11:37:09 <int-e> uname -a
11:37:46 <int-e> or cat /proc/version
11:39:13 <SickJacken> lol, another host that was showing a lot of mem consumption was indeed also a 2.6 kernel
11:39:25 <SickJacken> the difference in GHC versions is not it then probably?
11:39:55 <Igloo> That isn't even a factor if you're suing the same binary
11:40:44 <SickJacken> but why would a binary compiled on 2.6 using this 2.6 specific function (syscall trampoline) hog more memory on a 2.6 system...then on a 2.4 system that hasnt got this special function
11:41:30 <int-e> SickJacken: the syscall trampoline isn't doing it (it just makes system calls faster). you probably have different libc versions then, too, though
11:42:04 <Heffalump> try compiling with ghc -optl-static
11:42:11 <Heffalump> and see if you get the same disparity
11:46:11 <SickJacken> k im doing it
11:46:21 <SickJacken> bare with me, as compiling takes ages :D
11:54:13 <SickJacken> Heffalump, it seems to work
11:54:21 <Heffalump> as in it's ok on both machines?
11:54:23 <SickJacken> to be able to know for sure i would have to wait 15 minutes to let the app finish :P
11:54:35 <SickJacken> i am going to run it on the remote one now
11:54:51 <Heffalump> did you build it on the machine where the original worked, or where the original failed?
11:57:03 <SickJacken> i built it on the memslurping 2.6 machine
11:57:14 <SickJacken> i should now just copy the binary to the 2.4 right
11:57:15 <SickJacken> ?
11:57:18 <SickJacken> to see what it does
11:57:37 <musasabi> @seen JaffaCake
11:57:38 <lambdabot> I saw JaffaCake leaving #haskell 1 month, 3 days, 2 hours, 35
11:57:38 <lambdabot> minutes and 16 seconds ago, and I have missed 14 days, 7 hours, 11
11:57:38 <lambdabot> minutes and 44 seconds since then.
11:57:56 <dcoutts> but JaffaCake has been replying to lots of emails today
11:58:12 <dcoutts> hopefully he'll be back soon
11:58:33 <dcoutts> dons, shapr, boegel: what am I missing here: http://haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
11:58:48 <dcoutts> appart from the details of a development plan/vision
11:59:01 <dcoutts> i'm still on the motivation and justification bits
12:00:30 <Heffalump> SickJacken: yeah. Bit odd that it didn't go wrong, then.
12:01:07 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I'll definitely join in on the development of hIDE 2.x if you start the thing.
12:01:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, cool!
12:01:36 <dcoutts> Lemmih, damn, that means I've got to start the thing :-)
12:01:52 <ndm> dcoutts, i may as well - its certainly the direction i'd like things to proceed in
12:01:53 <dcoutts> Lemmih, fell free to add your ideas to the page above
12:02:21 <dcoutts> ndm, maybe we should have a list on the wiki page of people who have any interest in contributing
12:02:32 <dcoutts> yep, let me go add that
12:02:36 <dcoutts> wait a sec...
12:02:46 <SickJacken> Heffalump, crap its growing again
12:05:44 <ndm> a couple of points on the hide manifesto - more idle wonderings so not worth wikifying:
12:06:11 <dcoutts> ndm, go for it, I might record anything you say in the wiki anyway :-)
12:06:14 <ndm> not sure i like a tight coupling to ghc, but i suppose it can't be avoided to get the advanced features
12:06:18 <ndm> (feel free to record)
12:06:33 <dcoutts> ndm, it's a good point and something I wonder about too
12:06:43 <dcoutts> there's a tradeoff to be made obviously
12:06:48 <ndm> what is the close coupling for exactly?
12:07:00 <dcoutts> it's certainly a point worth discussing
12:07:17 <ndm> give things like :t and :i are pretty standard between hugs/ghc, and therefore allow the possibliity of switching
12:07:40 <dcoutts> ah but they require parsing and are not necessarily unambiguous
12:07:53 <ndm> but they are pretty close to being unambiguous
12:08:01 <dcoutts> the GHC api will give us for example fully qualified names and source locations
12:08:02 <ndm> the differences are minimal
12:08:24 <ndm> true, i'm not saying ghc isn't the way to go, but it has long term disadvantages
12:08:41 <ndm> maybe try to get other compilers implementing the same interface?
12:08:42 <dcoutts> ndm, the question really is not if we want to have close ghc integration but do we want to support multiple compilers/interpreters
12:08:48 <dcoutts> exactly
12:09:05 <dcoutts> so there is immediate payoff from just picking one, it's less work
12:09:14 <ndm> currently ghc is the only "real use" haskell compiler, but i feel it will change soon
12:09:20 <dcoutts> indeed
12:09:35 <dcoutts> longer term it's be ideal if we could abstract it and make it a per-project preference
12:09:38 <ndm> part of an integrated development environment is a debugger
12:09:55 <dcoutts> with different implementations available
12:09:59 <ndm> ideally you want hugs for developing, and ghc for release or somem combination
12:10:09 <dcoutts> eg jhc/helieum
12:10:17 <musasabi> or jhc to get ansi C.
12:10:24 <dcoutts> actually ghci for developing should be ok
12:10:27 <Heffalump> SickJacken: on which machine?
12:10:30 <ndm> or nhc
12:10:33 <dcoutts> I think it's actualyl better than hugs these days
12:10:36 <dcoutts> yes, or nhc
12:10:44 <dcoutts> however it mgiht be possible to do both...
12:10:58 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: ghci is not portable everwhere
12:11:06 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: so I still use hugs a fair bit
12:11:08 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, true
12:11:11 <CosmicRay> though I do prefer ghci
12:11:34 <dcoutts> however it should be postable to all platforms that support hs-plugins and any IDE will need hs-plugins
12:11:42 <ndm> anyway, its important to not overly integrate with ghc too soon
12:11:44 <dcoutts> eg, use ghc integration for the interactive development but then do the build with another compiler
12:11:45 <CosmicRay> ugh
12:12:06 <ndm> but debugging is an important concern
12:12:09 <Igloo> Hmm, if stderr and /dev/tty don't appear in the terminal there's nothing better I can try, right?
12:12:17 <dcoutts> ndm, please feel free to add a question about that on the wiki
12:12:23 <SickJacken> Heffalump, the 2.6 machine that was taking 1gig of swap and 450mem of normal now takes 655mb swap and 413mb normal
12:12:27 <CosmicRay> why would an ide require hs-plugins?
12:12:27 <SickJacken> so it is an improvement
12:12:28 <dcoutts> ndm, and your opinion on the issue
12:12:30 <CosmicRay> Igloo: I'm assuming stdout doesn't either
12:12:36 <CosmicRay> Igloo: in that case, I don't know of anything.
12:12:40 <Heffalump> SickJacken: and the other one takes what?
12:12:52 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, because it'll be extensable, like yi / lambdabot
12:12:59 <CosmicRay> ah
12:13:02 <ndm> integration with other tools is a really good idea
12:13:11 <SickJacken> its stable at 180mb which is almost exactly what it was using before
12:13:13 <SickJacken> weird
12:13:14 <dcoutts> ndm, yeah, via plugins
12:13:17 <ndm> and will probably require something like hmake, for haddock etc.
12:13:18 <SickJacken> it doesnt seem affected
12:13:44 <Heffalump> SickJacken: ok, so it must be the kernel somehow.
12:14:05 <Heffalump> (confirm with ldd that you really do have a statically linked binary)
12:14:12 <ndm> my ideas for a haskell "IDE" were: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/NeilMitchell/WinHaskell
12:14:45 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Yeah, thanks
12:14:51 <ndm> its taking another approach from hIDE, basically leave the editing in your favourite editor, and your IDE is a separate app
12:15:03 <ndm> its obviously not as convenient, but its a lot less work
12:15:29 <musasabi> syn
12:16:19 <SickJacken> Heffalump, a shit, the one on the 2.4 was dynamic, copy mistake on my side
12:19:22 <Philippa_> ndm: what I want for an IDE is a smart programmable text editor and a bunch of console apps I can pipe through. The text editor should offer console windows.
12:19:47 <Philippa_> unfortunately, it seems I'm supposed to make to with emacs
12:20:06 <ndm> textpad has some console prodding abilities
12:20:16 <ndm> they suck a bit, but they do exist
12:20:20 <SickJacken> Heffalump, ok im running the static bin on the 2.4
12:20:32 <Itkovian> Philippa_: vim?
12:20:34 <ndm> and you still need a proper GUI for debugging
12:20:47 <dcoutts> ndm, yes hIDE 1.x used an external editor
12:21:38 <musasabi> But emacs is smart (for suitable definitions), programmable and offers console windows ;)
12:21:49 <dcoutts> ndm, after working with that I became more convinced that taking that route while appealing severely limits the features that can be implemented and makes things fragile
12:22:16 <ndm> dcoutts, i appreciate the feature limits - but what about hte fragile bits?
12:22:52 <dcoutts> trying to do the integration with emacs/vim/nedit etc is fustrating and unreliable and it changes between versions
12:23:09 <dcoutts> and some editors are jsut too limited to support the features we will want eventaully
12:23:12 <SickJacken> Heffalump, but is the difference of what top tells me and what i am seeing on the heap graph picture not too big? i mean...90mb (on the pic) vs 450mb real mem (reported by top)
12:23:29 <ndm> dcoutts, define integration - if its just open this file at this line thats usually easy enough
12:23:35 <ndm> if its embedding, thats hard
12:23:40 <Heffalump> well, it might not be the GHC heap using the RAM
12:23:45 <dcoutts> vim can be embeded actually
12:23:48 <Heffalump> so is the static bin working on 2.4
12:23:49 <Heffalump> ?
12:24:23 <dcoutts> ndm, it's thinks like jumping to documentation for the thing under the cursor, managing multiple files being open
12:24:39 <ndm> dcoutts, ok - my aims are far less ambitious
12:24:51 <ndm> open the file with the error on the approiate line
12:24:52 <Philippa_> musasabi: my definition of smart includes having the wit to let me continue using all the conventions I'm used to on my system without having to spend a considerable amount of time in configuration
12:25:03 <dcoutts> the advantage of usign something like Yi is that we should be able to do advanced things and be able to write them in Haskell rather than lots of elisp
12:25:06 <ndm> nothing more than CVS WinHugs already does
12:25:35 <dcoutts> like non-regexp based systax highliting and navigation
12:25:37 <musasabi> yes, that can be very hard with emacs and elisp is not very nice.
12:26:07 <pejo> SickJacken, don't trust top blindly.
12:26:10 <dcoutts> I expect it'd be possible to define a basic editor interface that would allow the use of external editors
12:26:23 <dcoutts> but would not support some of the more interesting features
12:26:32 <ndm> ok, you were far more ambitious :) - my aim is to code WinHaskell in < 1000 lines of C
12:26:45 <Philippa_> I'm awaiting GUI yi, or at the least a documented interface I can mess with
12:26:48 <ndm> and about 600 lines of that will be stolen from WinHugs
12:27:00 <dcoutts> then it can be a user preference which editor plugin to use Yi/vim/emacs/sourceview
12:27:10 <basti__> @where hsql
12:27:11 <lambdabot> I know nothing about hsql.
12:28:29 <dcoutts> ndm, a feature that'd be really cool for a hugs/ide style thing is not having to reload a file to use it in the interpreter
12:28:58 <ndm> WinHugs has had that for over 4 years at least
12:28:58 <SickJacken> pejo, but it cant be off by a large right?
12:29:01 <dcoutts> ndm, and I don't just mean to automatically reload when the user moves to the interacive window
12:29:10 <SickJacken> in what way do you mean i must not trust top
12:29:14 <ndm> it just happens to be a preference thats turned off by default :(
12:29:15 <dcoutts> ndm, I mean not haveing to save the file
12:29:29 <ndm> ok, you do have to save
12:29:42 <dcoutts> ndm, I mean the module maynto be complete, it may have functions which are not syntactically correct
12:29:47 <ndm> it never bothers me, i have the Ctrl+S reflex from years ago when things crashed regularly
12:30:07 <ndm> dcoutts, i'm far less ambitious
12:30:18 <dcoutts> ndm, that the interpreter should allow you to use stuff which is valid while still alowing you to keep typing and adding stuff
12:30:29 <ndm> i think the goodies that a user wants are proper debugging
12:30:33 <Philippa_> I'd be happy with a save-and-reload key
12:30:38 <ndm> not lenient compiling
12:30:44 <ndm> WinHugs auto-reloads
12:30:45 <dcoutts> no need to have moments where you go and comment out the incomplete bits just to make the module compile
12:30:54 <ndm> hence the save key is a save-and-reload
12:31:06 <Philippa_> lenient compilation's useful for debugging though
12:31:21 <dcoutts> it'd make it genuinely interactive
12:31:29 <pejo> SickJacken, I have no idea how off top can be, but we had it reporting oracle using 31G memory on our 8G machines.
12:31:42 <SickJacken> :o
12:31:45 <ndm> one thing i considered was "unit test construction"
12:31:50 <SickJacken> pejo, how can i then verify it?
12:31:52 <ndm> type some example runs
12:31:54 <ndm> then start coding
12:32:05 <pejo> SickJacken, pmap works quite nicely under Solaris. No idea what tools your OS has.
12:32:07 <ndm> and as the example runs pass change, it tells you
12:32:15 <dcoutts> ndm, that'd be cool
12:32:19 <ndm> but thats not quite what i want in an IDE
12:32:25 <ndm> i don't think
12:32:35 <ndm> and it also encourages unit tests, which can be checked later
12:32:41 <ndm> and serve as good documentatino
12:32:47 <SickJacken> pejo, ah...i only knew top
12:32:52 <SickJacken> ntop is no different i guess
12:32:57 <dcoutts> ndm, actually an interactive thing on the lines of what I described above might allow that
12:33:10 <ndm> yeah
12:33:13 <ndm> i might have it as a mode
12:33:16 <pejo> SickJacken, I have no idea about your problem though, it was just a general heads up.
12:33:20 <dcoutts> if it recalculates thing when the values it depends upon change
12:33:23 <ndm> so you enter the interpetter and do that
12:33:34 <ndm> and then copy the code back when you've finished
12:33:35 <dcoutts> ie the test re-calculates whenever you change the function
12:33:36 <SickJacken> pejo, no problem. i dont know where the real problem is at anyway...any input is welcome
12:33:41 <ndm> dcoutts, have you seen the haskell spreadsheet thingy
12:33:48 <dcoutts> ndm, yes it looks cool
12:33:55 <SickJacken> that is what i like about the haskell community....lots of usable input
12:34:09 <ndm> i'm not so sure, i worry about ideas like static typing
12:34:18 <ndm> but it certainly has possible applications for things like this
12:34:39 <dcoutts> ndm, it doesn't give up static typeing as far as I can see
12:34:49 <SickJacken> Heffalump, the static binary uses less memory on the 2.4 kernel system...172mb vs. 188mb
12:35:05 <ndm> yeah, maybe i;m just not getting it quite
12:36:03 <pesco> Moin!
12:38:07 * SamB begins to question his use of Word to store what are supposed to be 16-bit numbers
12:38:27 * pesco shakes SamB violently.
12:38:45 <pesco> What's WRONG with you?!
12:38:47 <pesco> Wake up!
12:39:36 <SamB> well, I haven't run into trouble yet.
12:39:47 * Itkovian yawns
12:40:49 <SamB> on the other hand, maybe it would be less of a bother to convert in the one or so places I need to do so than it would be to .&. 0xffff here-there-and-everywhere...
12:41:40 * SamB prepares for violent hacking
12:41:48 <pesco> Right. Actually, I thought you meant MS Word. :-O
12:42:20 <SamB> hehe
12:42:34 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ndm: feel free to add yourselves to the list of ootential contributers at http://haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
12:42:43 <SamB> I can barely use Word...
12:43:03 <ndm> oh, one other thing
12:43:06 <dcoutts> dons, shapr, boegel, gour: that goes for you too
12:43:10 <dcoutts> ndm, yes?
12:43:12 <ndm> is the intention to be total cross platform?
12:43:27 <dcoutts> eventually, but probably not initially
12:43:34 <dcoutts> gtk2hs is cross platforms
12:43:41 <ndm> initially what will it be?
12:43:51 <dcoutts> probably start with linux
12:44:01 <ndm> :(, ndm sheds a tear
12:44:11 <dcoutts> actually it should probably always be cross platform come to think about it
12:44:26 <dcoutts> it just that there may be some plugins that may not build on all platforms
12:44:50 <ndm> as long as they are not required plugins
12:44:55 <Heffalump> SickJacken: right, must be a kernel issue, then
12:45:02 <dcoutts> ndm, indeed
12:45:02 <dcoutts> and if people pay attention (ie someone builds on other platforms regularly) then it should stay that way
12:45:20 <ndm> well i have the motivation to keep it windows happy
12:45:28 <Itkovian> http://suicidegirls.com/news/technology/11613/
12:45:34 <Itkovian> there goes yr motivation :-)
12:45:43 <dcoutts> ndm, that's another reason for plugins and interfaces, to have different implementations on different platforms
12:46:40 <dcoutts> ndm, eg configuration. On linux we might use gconf, but on windows the registry, but it should be easy to have a single interface that other plugins use such that they don't care which config backend they use
12:46:50 <ndm> yeah, sounds good
12:47:06 <ndm> despite the fact the registry is just badly designed...
12:47:08 <dcoutts> ndm, feel free to note the window issue on the wiki
12:47:10 <SickJacken> Heffalump, thanks a lot, although there is still work to be done in the app itself...im glad it at least runs on my box
12:47:25 <SickJacken> im going for a little relaxation now,
12:47:27 <dcoutts> ndm, true but it's still useful
12:47:34 <ndm> dcoutts, i will later - currently the internet is a bit fakey, housemates doing p2p
12:47:39 <dcoutts> ok :-)
12:47:43 <Philippa_> Itkovian: shit. Shitshitshit. You can guess which version I'll need to fork out for sooner or later
12:48:11 <Philippa_> on windows I still prefer non-registry configuration where possible
12:48:13 <Itkovian> sorry Philippa_ , didn't realise it would ruin yr day
12:48:42 <Philippa_> Itkovian: meh. It's going to be a while before I can afford a new box anyway
12:48:50 <Philippa_> I sure as hell don't intend to run it on this one
12:48:54 <Itkovian> I think the registry is a good idea, but not for _every_ little bit, and by golly, it is not just badly organised, it's unorganised
12:49:04 <dcoutts> Philippa_, well it would obviosuly be possible to implement it as a file backend on winddows rather than registry
12:49:06 <Itkovian> Philippa_: consider buying a mac
12:49:11 <Itkovian> my next machine will be one
12:49:21 <Itkovian> as my current is
12:49:25 <ndm> Itkovian, to become obsolete in a year when they change chips...
12:49:48 <ndm> i was about 3 months of buying a mac whne they announced that
12:49:53 <Itkovian> ndm: you really think so? they got a new reseller to get them PowerPC chips
12:50:13 <ndm> my pc is 5 years old now
12:50:31 <ndm> in 5 years time, a 5 year old mac will run nothing
12:52:09 <sieni> linux?
12:52:11 <xerox> Nah, there ever is linux.
12:52:15 <xerox> ...and rosetta.
12:56:43 <Itkovian> ndm: I will still be able to use my current software ... or at least the last upgrade of it.
12:56:53 <Itkovian> ndm: I can always switch to  linux ...
12:57:07 <Itkovian> ndm: besides, the pure coolness alone is worth it :-)
13:02:55 * boegel|home greats
13:04:32 <Muad_Dibber> yeah you are great boegel.
13:04:58 <boegel|home> that's not what I meant, but fine :p
13:05:27 <basti_> I can't link DBDirect (of haskelldb) because of undefined reference to `DatabaseziHSQLziMySQL_connect_closure'
13:06:50 <basti_> that sucks, though
13:08:26 <basti_> I do not like linker errors.
13:08:40 * boegel|home leaves again
13:08:47 <Heffalump> you are linking against whatever package Database.HSQL is in, right? :-)
13:09:46 <basti_> hmm actually I didnt change anything, i supposed it could work without intervention
13:09:53 <dcoutts> hey xerox what about that code? :-)
13:10:07 <basti_> but --package hsql is mentioned
13:11:06 <basti_> hsql-mysql is not. is that wrong?
13:15:41 <rafl> Does anyone have an idea why this code seems to leave options like --zzz as they are but eats up the arguments if they look like -zzz=foo? http://autrijus.org/tmp2.hs
13:15:46 <SamB> @hoogle Bool -> n
13:15:48 <lambdabot> Prelude.realToFrac :: (Real a, Fractional b) => a -> b
13:15:48 <lambdabot> Prelude.round :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) => a -> b
13:15:48 <lambdabot> Prelude.floor :: (RealFrac a, Integral b) => a -> b
13:39:29 <ndm> rafl, i think thats the behaviour of getOpts
13:39:52 <ndm> -zzz is an illegal option, its either -z or --zzz
13:39:58 <ndm> hence it probably ends up in errs
13:40:06 <rafl> ndm: I meant --zzz and --zzz=foo, of course.
13:41:56 <rafl> ndm: No, the =foo from -zzz=foo is not in rest nor in errs.
13:42:21 <ndm> bug in getOpts then possibly, it should be somewhere...
13:42:35 <SickJacken> ok relax time is over
14:01:03 <SyntaxNinja> y0
14:14:09 <SyntaxNinja> @wiki
14:14:10 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
14:18:32 <Lemmih> Urk. Designing hIDE seems close to impossible.
14:19:08 <arjanb> why is that?
14:19:26 <musasabi> Synenergy with yi would be nice.
14:19:52 <Lemmih> The editor would just be a plugin.
14:21:03 <Lemmih> But many of the other plugins requires tight integration with the editor.
14:53:28 <poetix> Help, I'm stuck betwe
15:04:29 <SyntaxNinja> heh
15:34:29 <dcoutts> Lemmih, that's ok, plugins can compile against each other
15:34:50 <dcoutts> you can have plugins that use the editor interface
15:35:22 <dcoutts> they can either compile against each other directly or indirectly through some mediating interface
15:36:39 <dcoutts> so for example it might be that we have a very basic editor interface and yi could implement that interface, however for advanced integration plugins, they would depend on the yi plugin specifically and could not work with the basic editor interface
15:37:36 <dcoutts> that'd allow people to write implementations of a basic editor interface using say emacs/vim, but then obviously they couldn't use the cool advanced editor plugins since they'd require the Yi plugin
15:37:45 <dcoutts> am I talking nonsense?
15:39:02 <dcoutts> if I'm not talking nonsense I should document this stuff.
15:39:26 <dcoutts> Lemmih, You know hs-plugins better than me, am I makeing any sense. Is this possible with hs-plugins?
16:06:26 <stepcut> how do I time something with greater than 1 second precision in haskell ? the TimeDiff functions seem to ignore anything less than one second
16:07:30 <stepcut> maybe I just do my own ClockTime calculations
16:07:35 * stepcut does that
17:09:37 <juhp> shapr: the ghc package in Fedora Haskell should work ok on haskell.org
17:11:09 <juhp> wouldn't be a bad idea to upgrade it to RHEL 4 though imho
17:13:43 <SyntaxNinja> @seen shapr
17:13:44 <lambdabot> shapr is in #webwitches and #haskell. Last spoke 8 hours, 22 minutes
17:13:44 <lambdabot> and 47 seconds ago.
17:14:09 <fatbrain> ... a two line response... what's that good for?
17:15:17 <dons> send a patch
17:18:32 <Speck> dons, what's the word on yi? any exciting recent developments?
17:22:19 <dons> there's been some discussion the past few days on how to merge yi with the goals of hIDE
17:22:41 <dons> however, i haven't worked on yi in a couple of weeks, since all the emacs stuff went in
17:23:40 <juhp> must try it again
17:25:14 <dons> it's still moving along, hopefully i can get some more time, or more developers :)
17:32:15 <juhp> wow - 178 patches since I last pulled :)
17:32:53 <dons> hehe
17:33:05 <dons> try thhe --as=mg mode
17:33:15 <juhp> dons: what is that?
17:33:31 <dons> mg is an emacs-like editor
17:33:43 <juhp> aha
17:36:04 <juhp> dons: is separate from Emacs2?
17:36:28 <dons> yep
17:36:42 <dons> --as=emacs2 is jyp's mode
17:36:48 <juhp> ok
17:37:06 <dons> i may cross emacs2 with mg to get the real emacs mode
18:28:59 <Drakioned> netsplit?
18:31:16 <Cale> yep
18:31:25 <Cale> zelazny.freenode.net irc.freenode.net
19:00:39 <luqui> consider this function:   group f list = (filter f list, filter (not.f) list)
19:00:39 <luqui> that evaluates f twice for each element in list, no?
19:00:39 <luqui> (in most implementations)
19:00:39 <luqui> can I write this function so that it still works on infinite lists but only evaluates f once for each element?
19:00:39 <sethk> luqui, would that be lazy, so that it would only evaluate if you use the value?
19:00:39 <luqui> right
19:00:39 <luqui> er, that was a question?
19:00:39 <sethk> so you can put in 50 of them, as long as you never ask for the value of anything.  :)
19:00:39 <sethk> luqui, yes
19:00:39 <sethk> luqui, I wasn't sure
19:00:39 <luqui> so I can say (fst $ group even [1..]) !! 500
19:00:39 <luqui> and have it actually return
19:00:52 <sethk> luqui, so you want to write it smarter so it "knows" that the computation is really the same for both?
19:01:00 <luqui> yeah
19:01:32 <sethk> can you put a monad in there somewhere that saves the result?
19:01:47 <luqui> Probably don't want to do that... caching is a bit much here
19:01:54 <luqui> I think I just figured it out
19:01:59 <sethk> how?
19:02:14 <luqui> it wouldn't be completely free, but it might substitute a cheap computation for an expensive one
19:02:31 <luqui> just map the list info (f x, x), and then filter out the resulting bools
19:02:57 <sethk> I don't follow
19:03:20 <luqui> let me get my syntax right (/me still has to think too much when writing haskell syntax)
19:04:24 <sethk> I was thinking you could make the second element just be the complement of the first element.  Would that be possible?
19:05:04 <luqui> would that be cheap?
19:05:10 <luqui> here's what I was doing:
19:05:29 <luqui> group f list
19:05:39 <luqui>     = let condl = map (\x -> (f x, x)) list in
19:05:49 <luqui>         (map snd $ filter fst condl, map snd $ filter (not . fst) condl)
19:06:14 <luqui> it's significantly more complicated, but it might be faster for a "hard-to-compute" f
19:06:41 <luqui> kind of a schwartzian transform
19:06:47 <sethk> I still need time to read that, let alone write it.  :)
19:07:05 <luqui> so if you have a list like [1,2,3,4,5]
19:07:19 <luqui> map that into [(False, 1), (True, 2), (False, 3), (True, 4), (False, 5)]
19:07:29 <luqui> and then filter back out based on the first value of the tuple
19:07:42 <luqui> (with even as "f")
19:08:18 * luqui decides to benchmark
19:12:49 <sethk> luqui, if you don't mind helping me, let's go back to your original function.  filter is going to create a list; it will take each member of list, apply f to it, and add the value to the new list if f(list element) returns true, correct?
19:13:14 <luqui> true
19:13:22 <luqui> er, correct :-)
19:13:23 <sethk> so, what you end up with is two disjoint lists?
19:13:27 <luqui> yeah
19:13:44 <sethk> not . f is function composition of f with boolean not, correct?
19:13:54 <luqui> right, like (\x -> not (f x))
19:14:49 <sethk> ok, so what you want to do, basically, is test each value, and if f is true add the value to one list, and if f is false add it to the other, only evaluating f once?
19:15:29 <luqui> righto
19:15:41 <sethk> My handy little Haskell book here does not have condl
19:15:55 <luqui> condl was defined in my "let" statement
19:16:13 <sethk> oh, ok, sorry about that.  :)
19:16:38 <sethk> I prefer where which makes me sloppy about looking for let.  :)
19:17:01 <sethk> why that name?  Is it analogous to foldl?
19:17:13 <luqui> huh, benchmark shows no difference whatsoever between the two versions I put here
19:17:18 <luqui> condl for "condition list"
19:17:19 <luqui> I guess...
19:17:27 * luqui has never been very good about naming things
19:17:41 <sethk> nothing wrong with the name that I can see.
19:17:54 <sethk> but when I code, I write   conditionList    or condition-list
19:18:06 <sethk> because I haven't been restricted to 8 character names in about 25 years.
19:18:18 <luqui> right, well, I hate camelCase, so I try to avoid it, and I'm just a lazy bastar
19:18:19 <luqui> d
19:18:31 <luqui> I'd love to use condition-list if that were allowed
19:18:52 <luqui> (as I would condition_list, but that's not allowed by Haskell culture )-:
19:18:52 <sethk> that's better, definitely, but conditionList isn't really all that bad.  :)
19:19:02 <luqui> it makes everything look the same to me
19:19:14 <luqui> hard to tell the difference between that and ConditionList to me
19:19:19 <luqui> anyway, beside the point
19:19:50 <sethk> another problem I have is that, while it makes sense to use ConditionList and conditionList for related things, doing so in tutorials and such is very very confusing.
19:20:02 <sethk> it makes it appear that the names are related when in fact they are arbitrary
19:20:10 <luqui> well, capitals yell "Type" to me
19:20:32 <sethk> yes, but not to someone just learning the language
19:20:57 <sethk> especially coming from environments where making the first character's case man something is sacreligious
19:20:58 <luqui> aaaanyway... hmm... I wonder why the two functions aren't different at all in speed
19:21:03 <sethk> s/man/mean/
19:21:23 <luqui> (yeah, when I first started, it was tough to me, too, but I quickly got used to it)
19:21:25 <sethk> I imagine because the computational component is dwarfed by the mechanics of creating the lists
19:21:39 <luqui> well, my function is isPrime
19:21:44 <luqui> and it was written in a pretty stupid way
19:21:55 <sethk> not stupid enough, apparently.   :)
19:21:59 <luqui> trying to find the 100,000th prime
19:22:09 <luqui> I figured the computational time would make a difference there
19:22:18 <luqui> OHHHHHH!!
19:22:21 <luqui> of course
19:22:34 <luqui> it's because in my benchmark, I extracted the "fst" of the return
19:22:35 <sethk> tell me, because obviously I missed it.
19:22:44 <luqui> so it's only testing the function once in both cases
19:22:47 <luqui> because Haskell is lazy!
19:22:52 <sethk> oh, ok.
19:22:57 <sethk> that I can follow.  :)
19:23:07 <luqui> My benchmark needs to print out the 100,000th prime *and* nonprime
19:23:37 <sethk> let me ask a question.  I was looking at the ocaml docs today and I noticed that, in ocaml, you can define a function, ocaml shows you the type, but that type is not really the type at all.
19:23:49 <sethk> because the type is further restricted when the function is invoked.
19:23:59 <sethk> I don't think Haskell does that.  Does it?
19:24:18 <Igloo> Have you got an example?
19:24:25 <sethk> e.g. ocaml will change 'a -> 'b to, say 'a -> int
19:24:32 <sethk> let me see if I wrote it down.
19:25:06 <sethk> well, I can just paste the thing from their doc.  It's not long
19:25:24 <sethk> their foldl function:
19:25:30 <sethk> List.fold_left;;
19:25:30 <sethk> - : ('a -> 'b -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a = <fun>
19:25:37 <sethk> then this...
19:25:37 <RickyRyan> http://pastebin.com/362162
19:25:50 <RickyRyan> Is anyone able to tell me why this wont work, should just be a very simple error :)
19:26:04 <sethk> class ['a] intlist (l : int list) =
19:26:04 <sethk>    object
19:26:04 <sethk>      method empty = (l = [])
19:26:04 <sethk>      method fold f (accu : 'a) = List.fold_left f accu l
19:26:04 <sethk>    end;;
19:26:05 <sethk> class ['a] intlist :
19:26:07 <sethk>   int list ->
19:26:09 <sethk>   object method empty : bool method fold : ('a -> int -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a end
19:26:11 <sethk> then this...
19:26:16 <sethk> let l = new intlist [1; 2; 3];;
19:26:17 <sethk> val l : '_a intlist = <obj>
19:26:22 <sethk> l#fold (fun x y -> x+y) 0;;
19:26:22 <sethk> - : int = 6
19:26:30 <sethk> l;;
19:26:30 <sethk> - : int intlist = <obj>
19:26:39 <sethk> l#fold (fun s x -> s ^ string_of_int x ^ " ") "";;
19:26:39 <sethk> This expression has type int but is here used with type string
19:26:50 <sethk> RickyRyan, sorry, I'm almost done.  :)
19:27:02 <sethk> Igloo, if you do the string form first, then it barfs on the int
19:27:18 <sethk> Igloo, whichever invocation is first changes the type, persistently.
19:27:26 <sethk> which I thought was very strange and also very very bad
19:27:43 <sethk> RickyRyan, what does it do, or not do?
19:29:02 <RickyRyan> compile error
19:29:16 <luqui> status on the benchmark: the new version is faster when you ask for both answers, but slower when you just ask for one.  makes sense...
19:29:24 <Igloo> RickyRyan: You want   read word * 5   (or use reads to do error checking)
19:29:31 <RickyRyan> aha
19:29:39 <RickyRyan> read (word * 5)
19:29:42 <RickyRyan> ?
19:29:56 <Igloo> sethk: Do you have an example not using classes?
19:30:08 <sethk> Igloo, I'll try to make one.
19:30:20 <RickyRyan> cant get it to compile using read :S
19:30:21 <sethk> Igloo, but I don't see anything class specific here, do you?
19:30:35 <Igloo> I don't know what class does in ML
19:30:40 <sethk> Igloo, on RickyRyan's thing, I don't see where the string is converted to an integer form.
19:30:52 <luqui> read word will do it
19:31:03 <luqui> read :: (Read a) => String -> a
19:31:07 <Igloo> RickyRyan: Oh, and you'll need to show the result too
19:31:09 <luqui> @type read
19:31:13 <lambdabot> forall a. (Read a) => String -> a
19:31:27 <luqui> show (5 * read word)
19:31:49 <sethk> luqui, if it had a decimal point would it create a float value?
19:32:04 <RickyRyan> putStrLn (word ++ " times by 5 is " ++ (show(read(word * 5))))
19:32:08 <RickyRyan> i still get an error hehe
19:32:15 * luqui doesn't know the precisities of haskell's numerics
19:32:28 <luqui> no, you want to read, *then* multiply
19:32:40 <RickyRyan> putStrLn (word ++ " times by 5 is " ++ (show(read(word)) * 5))
19:32:43 <RickyRyan> ?
19:32:49 <luqui> yeah
19:33:02 <luqui> "read word * 5" means "(read word) * 5"
19:33:08 <luqui> function application binds tighter than everything else
19:33:22 <RickyRyan> putStrLn (word ++ " times by 5 is " ++ (show(read(word)) * 5))
19:33:25 <sethk> looking at that signature, it says   String -> a   I don't see how that shows that it will be in a binary format.  Why couldn't a be anything at all?  Another string format, even.
19:33:25 <RickyRyan> gives me an error still
19:33:44 <luqui> sethk, it gives you back what you expect given the context
19:33:57 <luqui> er, wait
19:33:58 <Igloo> sethk: It has a Num context so will be defaulted Integer Int Double Float (by default)
19:34:01 <sethk> but the context just calls for something that can be printed, no?
19:34:15 <luqui> putStrLn (word ++ " times by 5 is " ++ show (5 * read word))
19:34:17 <sethk> Igloo, why does it have a Num context?  From the definition of read?
19:34:25 <luqui> RickyRyan, do you understand the precedence there?
19:34:42 <Igloo> Because it's being multiplied by 5
19:34:47 <luqui> sethk, the type inferencer is telling it
19:35:06 <sethk> it wants something that can be multiplied
19:35:15 <RickyRyan> i get an error
19:35:17 <luqui> @type (*)
19:35:18 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
19:35:21 <RickyRyan> when i tun this function hehe
19:35:25 <luqui> it wants something that fits this signature
19:35:29 <RickyRyan> do i need to write a type declaration for my input?
19:35:40 <luqui> RickyRyan, not usually
19:35:43 <Drakioned> read word :: Integer maybe?
19:35:59 <luqui> what kind of error is it giving you?
19:36:07 <sethk> luqui, because that is the signature of the multiplier operator?  @type shows you the type of whatever you give it?
19:36:14 <luqui> yeah
19:36:22 <RickyRyan> couldnt match the pattern
19:36:31 <luqui> ?
19:36:55 <sethk> how would I do that in ghci?  get it to show the type of * ?
19:37:01 <RickyRyan> couldnt match IO () against t -> t1
19:37:02 <luqui> :t (*)
19:37:04 <RickyRyan> or someting
19:37:14 <luqui> hmm
19:37:27 <sethk> :t (*) works.  I left out the ()
19:37:32 <luqui> sounds like you didn't parenthesize something
19:38:00 <luqui> yeah, (*) is the "normal" form of infix *.  That is (*) 2 3 is the same as 2 * 3
19:38:19 <luqui> RickyRyan, why don't you repaste?
19:38:35 <RickyRyan> timesby5 = do
19:38:36 <RickyRyan>    putStrLn "Enter the number to multiply by 5"
19:38:36 <RickyRyan>    word <- getLine
19:38:36 <RickyRyan>    putStrLn (5 * (read word))
19:38:36 <RickyRyan>  
19:38:36 * luqui watches as noobs like me help noobs like RickyRyan :-)
19:38:45 <luqui> RickyRyan, you forgot the show
19:38:51 <RickyRyan> took it out
19:38:54 <RickyRyan> wasnt working for me hehe
19:39:15 <luqui> the last line should be: putStrLn (show (5 * read word))
19:39:22 <luqui> note the parens
19:39:34 <luqui> (parens around (read word) isn't bad either, but it's unnecessary)

19:43:04 * luqui imagines so
19:43:11 <RickyRyan> yep i did thanks :)
19:43:18 <RickyRyan> anyone in here know sed scripts also?
19:43:22 <luqui> ugh sed
19:43:27 * luqui knows simple ones
19:43:35 <RickyRyan> cool may i msg you hehe
19:43:39 <Drakioned> because I wouldn't mind having a copy of that bot..
19:43:39 <luqui> okay

19:56:27 <luqui> RickyRyan, to be honest, I'm not sure how you'd do that in haskell
19:56:35 <Drakioned> is there a double version of pi?
19:56:36 <luqui> I mean, I could do it in 30 lines
19:56:37 <RickyRyan> its done using map i think
19:56:42 <luqui> but not easily
19:56:48 <RickyRyan> it should be simple enough
19:56:49 <lament> so how come there's no infinite expansion of pi there?
19:57:07 <Drakioned> RickyRyan, use Parsec?

19:58:03 <luqui> and you should probably stop coming to us with your homework :-/
19:58:36 <Drakioned> luqui, what? this place does homework? damn..
19:58:37 <RickyRyan> i dont have homework, im doing excercises in a tutorial (yet another haskell tutorial) hehe
19:58:47 <luqui> aa soo
19:59:15 <luqui> so let's clarify the problem
19:59:36 <luqui> you have a single string, and you want to replace every instance of "www.mywebpage.com" with "www.mynewwebpage.com"
20:00:01 <luqui> right?
20:00:26 <sethk> that homework stuff is very bad for haskell.  If I'm trying to convince a company to use it, and they see that, they'll run away.  They'll say "oh, it's only academic"
20:00:47 <luqui> sethk, well, it is, isn't it?  It's just so much fun academia
20:01:14 <luqui> RickyRyan, more appropriately, you want to write a replace :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
20:01:17 <sethk> luqui, no, I use it in real life
20:01:33 <sethk> or at least what passes for real life in my life.  :)
20:01:33 <Drakioned> there's a life outside of academia?
20:01:39 * luqui too, for an appropriate definition of "real life"
20:01:50 * luqui hacks perl 6 :-)
20:01:59 <luqui> now *that* may be only academic.. so...
20:02:19 <Drakioned> actually, I just had an idea with lambdabot
20:02:22 <sethk> luqui, don't say perl.  I'm tired of holding up that big wooden cross
20:02:41 <luqui> sethk, you know that perl 6 is implemented in haskell, right?
20:02:58 <sethk> luqui, what about cobol?
20:03:09 <luqui> ?
20:03:10 <Drakioned> @eval exitWith (ExitSucess)
20:03:11 <lambdabot> 18: Not in scope: `exitWith'28: Not in scope: data constructor `
20:03:11 <lambdabot> ExitSucess'
20:03:17 <sethk> implement cobol in Haskell
20:03:43 <luqui> why?  I'm having so much fun with perl
20:03:53 <luqui> it's pretty tricky to implement a language like that in a language like thi
20:03:54 <luqui> this
20:04:03 <sethk> luqui, you could at least use ruby, if you have to slum.  :)
20:04:16 <luqui> sethk, thank you for your support
20:04:25 <sethk> luqui, no charge.  :)
20:04:27 <luqui> I suppose I'll flush my life's work in perl down the drain, because it's unholy
20:05:17 <Drakioned> luqui, we can call it a foreign language extension for Haskell
20:05:28 <luqui> :-)
20:07:39 <sethk> luqui, not unholy.  sacreligious, but not unholy.   :)
20:08:03 <Pseudonym> Perl is not evil.  It's a penance.
20:08:24 <Drakioned> I know some people who happen to like Perl...
20:08:32 * luqui points to himself
20:08:34 <Pseudonym> It's not so bad.
20:08:47 <Drakioned> I have no idea how to code in it, so..
20:08:54 <sethk> luqui, I really think python and ruby are far far superior
20:09:06 * Pseudonym did have a paper in TPC one year
20:09:08 <sethk> perl doesn't have to be bad, the point is that there are much better alternatives
20:09:15 <Drakioned> not that I have any idea to code in Python, Ruby, C, Java, C++ or Haskell for that matter..
20:09:18 <sethk> and for most things ruby will get you to a working program more quickly
20:10:40 * luqui plugs his ears and says LALALALALALALA
20:10:40 <luqui> :-)
20:10:48 <luqui> let's talk about haskell, seeing as we're in #haskell
20:11:03 <luqui> go to #perl if you want to diss it
20:11:18 <lament> okay
20:11:20 <lament> basically, haskell sucks :)
20:11:26 <lament> what a horrible language!
20:11:28 <lament> use perl ;)
20:11:28 <luqui> haha
20:11:37 <lament> er oops slipped
20:11:49 <Drakioned> well, there's always '
20:12:00 <Drakioned> #haskell-blah for dissing Perl
20:12:20 <luqui> ? #haskell-blah?
20:12:40 <Drakioned> yes, boegel made it.
20:14:30 <Drakioned> okay people
20:14:33 <Drakioned> it's 4am now
20:14:36 <Drakioned> I'm off
20:14:37 <rafl> Could someone please take a look at http://autrijus.org/tmp2.hs, a piec of code autrijus gave me, and tell me how I can get the values of foo and bar (String and Bool) which should be parsed out of the arguments?
20:14:40 <luqui> night
20:14:46 <luqui> er, 'mornin
20:15:52 * luqui reads
20:16:17 <luqui> OptDescr?
20:16:52 <rafl> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System.Console.GetOpt.html#t%3AOptDescr
20:17:49 <luqui> rafl, does this code compile?
20:17:55 <luqui> including the main
20:18:44 <rafl> luqui: Yes.
20:19:12 <luqui> did autrijus write it?
20:19:22 <rafl> Yes(most of it)
20:19:24 <luqui> he's a crazy bastard isn't he?
20:19:28 <luqui> flip ($), wtf?
20:19:29 <rafl> Indeeed.
20:19:57 <luqui> how are we supposed to conceptualize *that*.  The function that takes its second argument and applies it to its first argument
20:20:14 <Korollary> @pl flip ($)
20:20:15 <lambdabot> flip id
20:20:18 <Korollary> hah
20:20:19 <luqui> aaanyway...
20:20:37 <sethk> luqui, flip city, as they used to say about 50 years ago
20:22:10 * luqui cannot decipher this code
20:22:17 <luqui> it's looks fine up until /^pp/
20:22:26 <luqui> and then I get completely lost
20:23:12 <rafl> :-( Maybe someone else?
20:25:21 <Korollary> what about pp ?
20:25:54 <luqui> http://autrijus.org/tmp2.hs
20:26:03 <Korollary> pp's type looks to be String
20:26:04 <luqui> or are you asking what's confusing about it?
20:26:13 <luqui> oh, I see it now
20:26:25 * luqui was pretty much ignoring the parens
20:27:18 <luqui> then main confuses me (it was /^pp/ and below)
20:27:32 <luqui> and I don't quite get options either
20:28:31 <luqui> but I can blame that on the GetOpt interface
20:29:19 <rafl> Well, here's an example that uses it: http://svn.openfoundry.org/openafp/afpdump.hs - but I don't understand it either.
20:30:05 <Korollary> it helps to comment code in any language heh. main is not really confusing, tho
20:30:34 * luqui lost it at flip ($)
20:30:46 * luqui gets depressed and wanders off &
20:33:52 <rafl> Well. If noone actually gets the code. How about an easier alternative? I need to get --foo=bar and --bar out of args. The rest of args shouldn't be changed.
20:35:00 <luqui> "out of" args?
20:35:17 <luqui> as in you want to make a new list of args without those things and extract their contents?
20:35:31 * luqui wishes haskell had nice support for regexes :-
20:35:33 <luqui> :-)
20:35:44 <rafl> Yes. Sounds good. :-)
20:37:00 <luqui> group (isPrefixOf "--foo") args
20:37:10 <rafl> supporting both --foo=bar and --foo bar would be nice, btw. :-)
20:37:15 <Korollary> haskell has nice support for regexes imho
20:37:26 <luqui> if you'll look up about three pages, you'll see the definition of "group"
20:37:35 <luqui> oh, if so, then use regex substs
20:38:17 <luqui> (about two hours ago)
20:39:05 <rafl> Maybe someone can guide me a bit with that? I'm completly new to haskell and initially only wanted to do "a quick hack" :-)
20:39:35 * luqui has found that haskell pretty much sucks at text processing (unless you use Parsec)
20:39:44 <luqui> maybe a different project would be a better first project
20:39:49 * luqui looks through his various first projects
20:40:31 <rafl> Well, if the project I want to do this hack for wasn written in haskell...
20:40:39 <luqui> ohhhh
20:41:03 <luqui> pugs isn't terribly low-level haskell either
20:41:23 <luqui> autrijus did not go easy on the abstractions :-)
20:41:31 <rafl> It's not about pugs.
20:41:34 <luqui> really?
20:41:55 <luqui> there are other projects in Haskell? ;-)
20:41:59 <Korollary> rafl: so you wanna take out every occurrence of a string from another string ?
20:42:12 <luqui> and remember the results
20:42:23 <rafl> I simply want to make a project written by a teammate less annoying.
20:42:35 <rafl> Korollary: Well, from a list of strings.
20:44:51 * luqui does homework
20:44:54 * luqui &
20:45:12 <Korollary> @eval dropWhile ("oops" ==) ["well", "oops", "yes", "oops"]
20:45:13 <lambdabot> ["well","oops","yes","oops"]
20:45:34 <Korollary> ugh
20:46:22 <Cale> @eval filter (/= "oops") ["well", "oops", "yes", "oops"]
20:46:23 <lambdabot> ["well","yes"]
20:46:35 <Cale> @eval concat $ filter (/= "oops") ["well", "oops", "yes", "oops"]
20:46:37 <lambdabot> "wellyes"
20:46:49 <Cale> @eval concat $ intersperse ", " $ filter (/= "oops") ["well", "oops", "yes", "oops"]
20:46:51 <lambdabot> "well, yes"
20:47:47 <rafl> I also want to remember what I took out of the list.
20:47:52 <Cale> luqui: it does have nice support for regexes
20:48:04 <Cale> @eval partition (/= "oops") ["well", "oops", "yes", "oops"]
20:48:06 <lambdabot> (["well","yes"],["oops","oops"])
20:48:31 <luqui> partition!
20:48:34 <luqui> I just wrote that function
20:48:40 <luqui> but it's built in :-)
20:48:51 * luqui deletes three lines of code
20:48:58 <Korollary> there's a ton of stuff in the libraries that many of us dont know.
20:49:01 <rafl> Cale: How about matching two different strings?
20:49:19 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Text.Regex.html is the regex library
20:49:32 <Cale> for matching different strings, just alter the predicate
20:49:45 <luqui> @eval partition (\x -> x /= "oops" && x /= "bing") ["well", "oops", "bing", "yungo", "oops"]
20:49:47 <lambdabot> (["well","yungo"],["oops","bing","oops"])
20:49:57 <luqui> that's a first approximation, but it doesn't really get your job done
20:50:46 <rafl> Yes. It needs to match /^oops=.*/ instead of /^oops$/
20:51:24 <luqui> you can use isPrefixOf
20:51:30 <luqui> or you can use the regex library
20:51:37 <Korollary> then you can split into words and apply a regex filter individually
20:52:06 <Cale> @eval partition ("oops" `isPrefixOf`) ["oopsie", "whoops", "oops", "aha!", "green", "clear"]
20:52:08 <lambdabot> (["oopsie","oops"],["whoops","aha!","green","clear"])
20:52:31 <luqui> i.e. (rafl doesn't know haskell too well)
20:52:53 <luqui> @eval partition (\x -> isPrefixOf "oops" x) ["oopsie", "whoops", "oops", "aha!", "green", "clear"]
20:52:55 <lambdabot> (["oopsie","oops"],["whoops","aha!","green","clear"])
20:53:06 * luqui was perplexed by the pointless style for so long...
20:53:15 <luqui> *pointfree
20:53:22 <Cale> at least use isPrefixOf "oops"
20:53:22 <luqui> and pointless :-)
20:53:35 <Cale> @eval partition (isPrefixOf "oops") ["oopsie", "whoops", "oops", "aha!", "green", "clear"]
20:53:37 <lambdabot> (["oopsie","oops"],["whoops","aha!","green","clear"])
20:53:50 <luqui> sure, I was just explaining it
20:53:54 <Cale> ah :)
20:54:05 <rafl> Yes. It needs to match /^oops=.*/ instead of /^oops$/
20:54:06 <Cale> \x -> f x = f
20:54:10 <rafl> Ups, sorry.
20:54:32 <Cale> ah, missed the =
20:54:50 <Cale> in the prefix
20:55:00 <luqui> I think rafl accidentally hit "up enter"
20:55:13 <luqui> because he already said that :-)
21:04:49 <rafl> Hm. Why do I get this error? http://nopaste.debianforum.de/1069
21:07:32 <sethk> rafl, try putting >> before putStrLn "foo"
21:07:36 <sethk> rafl, I think
21:08:29 <Korollary> @type partition
21:08:30 <lambdabot> bzzt
21:08:42 <sethk> bzzt?
21:08:51 <TheHunter> no, you gotta replace "(opts, rest) <-" with "let (opts, rest) ="
21:09:22 <TheHunter> partition returns a value, and <- expects a monadic action on the rhs.
21:09:55 <TheHunter> @type Data.List.partition
21:09:56 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
21:10:28 <sethk> TheHunter, you are right, I didn't read the message carefully.
21:10:48 <sethk> TheHunter, although I think >>= might have made it happy because that converts the target
21:11:32 <TheHunter> depends on how you'd done it.
21:11:55 <TheHunter> "(opts, rest) <- return $" would've also done the trick.
21:13:00 <sethk> TheHunter, I have to sit down and look at the type signatures of >>, >>=, and return, and maybe finally understand what is happening.
21:13:21 <sethk> TheHunter, do, etc. is very nice but no matter what error you make you almost always get the same error message
21:13:37 <sethk> having an IO where it doesn't want one, or wanting an IO where it doesn't have one.  :)
21:14:01 <TheHunter> it just needs a little bit of practise.
21:17:14 <sethk> if I installed a binary version of ghc, do I have prelude.hs somewhere on my box?
21:18:38 <rafl> What do I need to import to get split?
21:20:59 <sethk> List.hs, I think
21:21:26 <TheHunter> sethk, nope.
21:21:30 <TheHunter> @libsrc Prelude
21:21:31 <lambdabot> http://darcs.complete.org/fptools/libraries/base/Prelude.hs
21:21:49 <sethk> TheHunter, I find it in a List.hs file
21:22:06 <sethk> might be splitAt
21:22:22 <TheHunter> yes, the Prelude re-exports some stuff from Data.List
21:22:29 <TheHunter> or GHC.List, for that matter.
21:24:46 <rafl> Hm, I think I need a split :: String -> [String]
21:26:09 <rafl> No, split :: String -> String -> [String]
21:26:38 <rafl> It should split up the second string at the first one and return a List of the resulting strings.
21:27:04 <luqui> rafl, use hoogle
21:27:18 <luqui> @hoogle [a] -> [a] -> [[a]]
21:27:19 <lambdabot> Prelude.enumFromTo :: Enum a => a -> a -> [a]
21:27:19 <lambdabot> Prelude.enumFromThen :: Enum a => a -> a -> [a]
21:27:19 <lambdabot> Prelude.enumFromThenTo :: Enum a => a -> a -> a -> [a]
21:27:32 * luqui doesn't see a split
21:32:59 <TheHunter> no such thing in the libs.
21:39:55 <dons> rafl, download h4sh, and use H4SH.List.split
21:40:31 <dons> --  > split "," "foo,bar,,baz," -> ["foo", "bar", "", "baz", ""]
21:40:34 <rafl> dons: I found a split in http://svn.openfoundry.org/openafp/src/OpenAFP/Prelude/Exts.hs
21:41:00 <dons> there are many functions that do sort of the same thing with this name
21:41:13 <rafl> dons: Unfortunately I get some compile errors when using it.
21:42:12 <dons> here: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/h4sh/H4SH/List.hs
21:44:02 <luqui> paste?
21:44:38 <luqui> lisppaste2, url?
21:44:38 <lisppaste2> To use the lisppaste bot, visit http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell and enter your paste.
21:45:10 <lisppaste2> luqui pasted "split" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/11636
21:45:34 * luqui has fun writing simple stuff in haskell because it's so hard
21:46:10 <luqui> Perl's philosophy when applied to haskell:  the easy things should be hard, and the hard things should be really easy seeming
21:46:51 <sethk> might need some work on the grammar   :)
21:47:20 <luqui> :-)
21:47:35 <luqui> maybe s/seeming/in comparison/
21:49:48 <lament> "should appear easy"?
21:50:46 <Cale> luqui: It gets a lot easier with practice
21:50:57 <luqui> probably
21:51:07 <luqui> funny, I have a firm grasp on using Haskell's awesome abstraction power
21:51:21 <luqui> but when it comes to doing something like split a string with another string, I bang my head against the wall
21:51:30 <lament> use python
21:51:35 <dons> isn't the last line just: chr : split pat rest
21:51:47 <Khisanth> lament: seemingly easy?
21:52:09 <lament> oh, don't use python then :)
21:52:14 <dons> actually, that code is weiird
21:52:21 <Khisanth> and why is it the reverse of Perl? :)
21:52:59 <luqui> Khisanth, you have to ask?
21:53:01 <TheHunter> Data.List doesn't have everything one wants it to have...
21:53:12 <luqui> (the first time I wrote split here, the strings came out in reverse :-)
21:53:30 <luqui> dons, how would you do it?
21:53:31 <Khisanth> luqui: but that is not unexpected!
21:53:59 * luqui is still getting the hang of haskell idiomatic programming
21:54:06 <dons> luqui, see my link above. i already posted a version
21:54:26 <dons> actually, that's from MissingH
21:55:00 <dons> and is a bit verbose for my taste, but at least it works and has haddocks
21:55:01 <luqui> ahh.
21:55:08 * luqui didn't know about breakList
21:55:24 <luqui> probably would have approached it a little differently
21:55:28 <TheHunter> then again, it has stuff like mapAccumR that probably nobody has ever used.
21:55:41 <dons> luqui, breakList is defined locally as well though.
21:55:46 <luqui> oh
21:55:54 <dons> TheHunter, and transpose is another odd one
21:56:14 <TheHunter> transpose is occasionally useful (but often inefficient)
21:58:00 <Khisanth> luqui: working on <<>>?
21:58:34 <luqui> Khisanth, ?
21:59:51 <luqui> you mean perl's fmap?
21:59:55 <luqui> er?
22:03:59 <Khisanth> I meant «»
22:05:12 <lispy> hm...according to apt the version of ghc in unstable is uninstallable
22:05:21 <luqui> like @a >>+<< @b
22:05:22 <lispy> it has two depedencies which are mutually exclusive
22:05:40 <lispy> libgmp3-dev and libgmp3c2
22:05:40 <Cale> transpose is important :)
22:06:00 <Cale> but yeah, I'll agree that it can be inefficient
22:07:53 <lispy> this makes me sad, i didn't want to install ghc6.2, and i'm not confident about building it from source
22:08:19 <TheHunter> you don't need to build it, just use the binary from haskell.org
22:08:54 <lispy> that still bypasses apt tho
22:09:20 <lispy> ghc-cvs from 2005-03-31 is installable, maybe it's stable
22:09:48 <TheHunter> put it in /home
22:10:32 <TheHunter> 03-31 is way old :)
22:10:52 <lispy> oh weird, it's installing hugs
22:12:01 <lispy> i'll just go with 65.2 for now
22:12:08 <lispy> er 6.2
22:12:47 <lispy> by the time i have problems the packages should be fixed in apt :)
22:13:07 <Korollary> back at school, lispy ?
22:13:55 <TheHunter> stupid fedex, what are they thinking keeping my precious RAM in Indiana for 30 hours now?
22:14:11 <Korollary> they're waiting for the prices to rise
22:14:41 <lispy> Korollary: more or less yeah
22:14:52 <TheHunter> no, the package shipped from california on saturday.
22:16:05 <Korollary> standard ground ?
22:16:07 <lispy> TheHunter: did you check on line or call them?
22:16:21 <TheHunter> check online
22:16:27 <lispy> TheHunter: i found fedex website is very often not updated
22:17:18 <lispy> my server came 3-4 days earlier than it should have according to fedex website, but when i called they quoted me the day it arrived
22:18:16 <TheHunter> quote?
22:19:29 <lispy> well, they have an estimated arrival date
22:20:03 <lispy> it's a quote in the sense that a mechanic gives you a quote on the cost to fix your car
22:20:04 <TheHunter> last time, the package was also faster than they originally said, but 5 days for 800 miles would've been way to slow.
22:22:10 <TheHunter> maybe i should check my mail, could've made it here till sunday afternoon if they didn't update their stupid site.
22:22:20 <lispy> @eval 2^48 `div` 2^30
22:22:21 <lambdabot> 262144
22:23:05 <lispy> is that right?  48bit address space can address 262144GB of ram?
22:24:57 <Korollary> heh, did you really need to perform that division ? ;)
22:25:09 <lispy> Korollary: no :)
22:25:16 <lispy> i could have done 2^18
22:25:26 <Korollary> well that's a lot of address bits
22:25:45 <lispy> but it seemed more official that way :)
22:26:06 <lispy> yeah, we won't be hitting the 48bit address space limit in the next couple years
22:26:32 <Korollary> in 1994 I had about 16MB iirc
22:26:47 <Korollary> I have 512MB now
22:27:52 <Korollary> doubled every other year
22:28:07 <lispy> i bought honey in bulk at the store, came to $2.56, so i told my gf that i bought a "byte of honey"
22:28:58 <Korollary> registered ?
22:29:38 <lispy> what do you mean?
22:29:51 <Korollary> (as in registered memory)
22:30:13 <lispy> the ram in my new computer is ECC, is that the same?
22:30:17 <Korollary> yes
22:30:54 <lispy> it has 1GB, i figured i can upgrade it later if it's not enough :)
22:31:24 <lispy> i need to get darcs on here
22:32:38 <mflux> hmm.. well ecc is registered, but registered doesn't mean ecc?
22:34:12 <Korollary> mflux: hmm. wikipedia says there are non-registered ecc as well
22:35:51 <mflux> I had imagined that that's some technical requirement, but my point was that ecc is not the same as registered ;)
22:35:56 <Korollary> I don't even remember when I couldn't find something on wikipedia...
22:40:07 <Korollary> woohoo, dons' paper on ltu..
22:43:46 <lispy> hmm...darcs-unstable doesn't build from the tarball
22:43:51 * dcoutts re-reads dons's paper on "Plugging Haskell In"
22:56:19 <eyck> plugging it in what?
23:01:15 <dcoutts> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/paper/
23:02:08 <dcoutts> eyck, building haskell apps based on plugins
23:02:16 <eyck> ok, thnx.
23:02:52 * rafl packaged that for Debian recently.
23:04:01 <dcoutts> oh wait I want to be reading dons's newer paper "Dynamic Applications From the Ground Up"
23:04:06 <dcoutts> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/papers/SC05.html
23:04:38 <dcoutts> that's the one on building fully dynamic apps based on plugins (like lambdabot and yi)
23:05:57 <ozone> dcoutts: don's also got another paper he's presenting at ICFP this year, which is very cool
23:06:03 <ozone> email him if you want it, i guess :)
23:06:49 <dcoutts> ozone, that's the one I'm reading I think
23:06:52 <dcoutts> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/papers/SC05.html
23:07:01 <ozone> oh, duh
23:07:08 <dcoutts>  booktitle = {Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Haskell},
23:07:08 <ozone> yeah, it'd be helpful if i could read what other people type :)
23:07:11 <dcoutts>  notes = "To appear"
23:07:25 <dcoutts>  year = 2005,
23:08:39 <dcoutts> ozone, interested in a Haskell IDE based on hs-plugins?
23:09:11 <dcoutts> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
23:09:37 <dcoutts> we're gathering a list of possibly interested contributors
23:09:41 <ozone> dcoutts: i'd rather re-invent something else than IDE to be honest, but i have no complaints about the idea :)
23:09:50 * Korollary wishes he had more time hacking haskell
23:09:52 <ozone> about people who work on the project, i mean
23:10:51 <dcoutts> well hopfully we'll get something useful and people will be able to write extensions easily so it won't look like re-inventing so much :-)
23:11:40 <dcoutts> yeah, the problem is that most Haskell hackers are so busy all the time
23:11:51 <Korollary> dcoutts: I'd recommend supporting other languages to capture mindshare
23:12:21 <dcoutts> Korollary, I'm not sure that'd be useful. Other languages already have IDEs.
23:12:36 <dcoutts> and they'd want other things
23:12:49 <dcoutts> and they wouldn't like doing it in Haskell
23:13:08 <dcoutts> "Haskell developers know Haskell and not elisp/Java/C++/COM/C#. Therefore we are only likely to be able to get Haskell developers to help out by writing extensions if they can do so in Haskell."
23:13:42 <sethk> hey, I know java, c++ and c#.  Not elisp or COM.  :)
23:13:43 <Korollary> no, the implementation should be in haskell, but it could be possible to edit java code.
23:13:55 <eyck> yeah, like the all-famous perl IDE.
23:14:03 <eyck> that everyone keeps on talking about
23:14:12 <sethk> the eclipse java plug in is absolutely world class and untouchable
23:14:15 <dcoutts> eg lambdabot gets lots of contributions because it's easy to contribte and develop plugins independently
23:14:22 <sethk> a haskell plugin for eclipse would be a nice thing to have
23:14:38 <Korollary> sethk: a project exists iirc (may be inactive, tho)
23:14:50 <sethk> Korollary, hadn't heard about it.
23:15:11 <sethk> Korollary, since they only recently got a decent c++ plugin, I assumed that nothing else was close to being ready.
23:15:12 <Korollary> sethk: http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net/haskell/
23:15:18 <dcoutts> sethk, yeah, I'm not quite sure about that. I doubt that it'd be easy to make writing extensions in Haskell easy in that case. I may be proved wrong however.
23:15:21 <sethk> Korollary, thanks, I'll take a look at it.
23:15:38 <sethk> dcoutts, there are probably problems that are not immediately obvious
23:15:49 <sethk> dcoutts, there usually are.  :)
23:15:54 <dcoutts> yeah
23:16:00 <araujo> Hello here
23:16:08 <dcoutts> with both the eclipse and stand alone approaches :-)
23:16:15 <dcoutts> hi araujo
23:16:19 <Khisanth> eyck: there is a Perl IDE?
23:16:33 <araujo> Heya dcoutts , what's up bud?
23:16:36 <sethk> I'm sure there are several
23:16:44 <rafl> Yes, there was an article on perl.com mentioning it recently.
23:16:52 <dcoutts> araujo, I'm trying to sell the idea of a Haskell IDE :-)
23:16:57 <rafl> (I mean an eclipse based one)
23:16:58 <dcoutts> with limited success :-)
23:17:06 <eyck> Khisanth: well, every newbie outthere is talking about it;) (and there really is Perl IDE, commercial one, called komodo or sth like that)
23:17:08 <araujo> haha
23:17:22 <Korollary> dcoutts: My general point is that a haskell app is more likely to grow if it doesn't suffer from the circular "for haskell by haskellers" philosophy. If it allows editing other languages, then it could be like darcs & pugs and pull in more people.
23:17:22 <araujo> dcoutts, hey, we already have our dear emacs ;-)
23:17:36 <sethk> dcoutts, I want a Haskell IDE.  I'll never convince commercial clients to use haskell without one
23:17:49 <araujo> sethk, :-P
23:17:54 <Khisanth> well there is komodo but I didn't know ... oh you mean an IDE written in Perl? :)
23:17:57 <Lemmih> dcoutts: (continuing the conversation from some hours ago), Yeah it makes sense. I first though you wanted a grand editor interface API so every plugin would work with every editor.
23:18:10 <dcoutts> sethk, we've a page with ideas we'd love you to contribute to: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
23:18:21 <sethk> dcoutts, ok, I'll try
23:18:36 <sethk> dcoutts, unfortunately I wasn't really able to do anything at all with Haskell for the last year or so.
23:19:59 <dcoutts> Korollary, yes  I can see that point, however I'm not sure it applies so well to an IDE where half the point is that the extension language is the same as the primary target language. But then emacs is used be people other than lisp coders so maybe I'm wrong.
23:20:05 <Khisanth> clients refuse to use a language unless there is and IDE FOR it or IN it? :)
23:20:15 <dcoutts> both! :-)
23:20:41 <Khisanth> FOR is just ... sad, IN is weird :)
23:20:51 <dcoutts> he he :-)
23:21:04 <vegai> many IDEs written in pure C?
23:21:14 <sethk> Khisanth, it depends.  If you use it because you don't know how to build, that is one thing.  If you use it as a productivity tool that's another
23:21:20 <dcoutts> Korollary, anyway it'd certainly be useful for a Haskell IDE to support languages other than Haskell since many projects use multiple languages, particularly the C/Haskell combo
23:22:04 <Korollary> dcoutts: if we are right in our claim, then it should be very trivial to add such support in the future. We should not exclude the possibility is all I am saying.
23:22:09 <Khisanth> but an IDE does not guarantee productivity
23:22:27 <sethk> Khisanth, no, of course not.  I just meant that an IDE is not necessarily a bad thing.  It depends on how it is used.
23:22:58 <Therefore> well, killing people is not necessarily a bad thing either,
23:23:09 <Therefore> It depends on how it is used.
23:23:15 <dcoutts> Korollary, indeed, we're thinking of using Yi as an editor (with a Gtk GUI) and so it should be easy to add editor support for other languages. And it should be possible to add build system support too.
23:23:27 <sethk> Therefore, I find the analogy less than enlightening, I'm afraid
23:23:36 <dcoutts> we would use cabal as the build system probably and it supports building .c files I think
23:23:46 <Therefore> sethk: think about it.
23:23:49 <Khisanth> sethk: I am just saying it's a sad state of affairs if business are making decisions based on the existence of an IDE :)
23:24:10 <sethk> Khisanth, oh, they make decisions on things far more depressing than that
23:24:17 <Korollary> Khisanth: businesses are making such decisions and they are not terribly wrong about it imho.
23:25:15 <dcoutts> Khisanth, I'm not so sure. They are familiar with languages which *need* an IDE to be productive, so it's not such an odd thing that they want an IDE for any language they move to. Even if we get along fine without.
23:25:17 <Khisanth> heh I can see cases where it would be good :)
23:25:17 <sethk> Well, the Haskell case is different.  A person who doesn't understand the C++ compiler terribly well can still crank out code.
23:25:39 <Khisanth> "To use language X you MUST use an IDE"
23:25:43 <sethk> I can't imagine someone producing useful Haskell code who couldn't compile it manually if he needed to.
23:26:03 <sethk> Khisanth, no, to use any language you must demonstrate the availability of a range of tools, including an IDE.
23:26:30 <Korollary> Khisanth: It's not that you MUST, but when you claim "behold the beautiful language", they naturally ask "so where are the heaps of apps written in this language, such as an IDE, etc."
23:26:39 <dcoutts> an IDE could make understanding / maintaining code easier by provding "jump to definition" & "jump to documentation" features
23:26:49 <Khisanth> sethk: I mean it would not be a good idea to choose the language it it always required the use of an IDE
23:27:07 <sethk> dcoutts, oh, definitely, a well thought out IDE is a very useful tool, and integrated source browsing is great for development
23:27:17 <dcoutts> like ctags/hstags but make it "just work"TM and easy to use
23:27:24 <sethk> dcoutts, having an instant view of a type would be a great feature
23:28:53 <sethk> And as I said I don't really see any possibility that someone would use a Haskell tool to avoid understanding what he is doing
23:29:42 <dcoutts> sethk, except maybe students :-)
23:30:27 <dcoutts> sethk, yes getting type info is one thing that using the GHC api should give us
23:32:19 <aleator> dcoutts: Best productivity feature I found in "ide" is leo's user-built outlines and views. (Only reason so far to use something else than vim&make)
23:32:58 <musasabi> Having integrated type checking and haddock documentetation could be nice.
23:33:08 <musasabi> *documentation
23:33:56 <dcoutts> musasabi, yes "jump to documentation" for the function name under the cursor/mouse whatever
23:34:11 <dcoutts> aleator, interesting, do you have a reference?
23:34:36 <Korollary> leo.sf.net iirc
23:34:44 <Korollary> I've used it for about 6 months
23:34:52 <aleator> dcouts: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
23:35:25 <aleator> Docs don't tell, much so you'd practicly would need to try it out..
23:35:35 <sethk> uses python.  That's acceptable (at least to me  :)   )
23:36:01 <aleator> Sadly leo feels quite crappy.
23:36:11 <sethk> how do you mean?
23:36:18 <sethk> I thought you said you like it
23:36:19 <Korollary> I stopped using it after the introdcution of @file nodes, iirc.
23:36:40 <aleator> Well, I like it, but it feels just unreliable.
23:37:05 <dcoutts> aleator, ok, how would you describe user-built outlines and views?
23:37:15 <Korollary> dcoutts: I think an outlines mode would be really useful
23:37:29 <Korollary> even without literate programming
23:37:42 <dcoutts> Korollary, is that where you can selectivly colapse/expand bits of the code?
23:38:06 <dcoutts> eg colapse a function/class/data decleration to just one line
23:38:19 <dcoutts> with a little +/- button next to it or whatever
23:38:21 <Korollary> dcoutts: sort of. you can have a deeper tree structure
23:38:32 <Korollary> not exactly like SciTE
23:38:35 <dcoutts> like /- on all the where clauses
23:38:53 <aleator> dcoutts: Well.. thing where you can build your programs by separating relevant bits of code into nodes as you choose. As well as having different nodes for documentation and a tree view for whole thing.
23:39:12 <Korollary> yeah I used to abuse it as a project management tool.
23:39:21 <Korollary> notes, diary, etc.
23:39:35 <aleator> dcoutts: Next important thing is allowing clones of the nodes so you can build different views of your program by cloning nodes where you want (code withing documentation etc.)
23:39:43 <sethk> hmm, it's a zip file.
23:41:17 <sethk> looks interesting.  I was thinking about writing something vaguely like this to run on a palm pilot.
23:42:15 <aleator> But anyhow. Try it out. The idea is neat. (Even if leo itself is bit limited)
23:42:15 <Korollary> maybe in hIDE you could have a mode where you just put your code in random nodes as you please, and it deals with storing the code in actual files.
23:42:50 <dcoutts> there needs to be some module breakdown
23:43:11 <Cale> I wonder how difficult it would be to program in C++, but make everything const. :)
23:43:18 <dcoutts> aleator, thanks I'll have a look some time
23:43:46 <aleator> Just leave module breakdown to user. Make some nodes @module nodes that eventually are written out as .hs files.
23:43:59 <Korollary> module breakdown could be manual/auto
23:45:12 <dcoutts> sounds like quite a radical gui design, I'm not quite sure how the unwashed massed would take to it :-)
23:45:38 <aleator> since when is haskell community been interested in providing for unwashed masses? :)
23:45:42 <dcoutts> people quite like their text editor style guis
23:45:42 <Korollary> dcoutts: worry about that in 18 years when it's finally version 0.2 ;)
23:45:45 <aleator> is->has
23:45:53 <dcoutts> hah ha
23:46:02 <sethk> Cale, there would be a few things that would be a mite difficult to do.  :)
23:46:18 <dcoutts> Korollary, yeah, getting stuff working at all is an acheivement :-)
23:46:52 <dcoutts> aleator, pugs. I'll say no more ;-)
23:47:28 <aleator> dcoutts: touch.
23:48:19 <Korollary> dcoutts: if haskell is as good as we say it is, then it should take only half as long as with <insert other lang>. let money in mouth where...
23:48:45 <aleator> But seriously, the outlining mode in leo supports non-use. ie. Just name your files and write them as you would otherwise. Just like a project manager app.
23:49:28 <dcoutts> Korollary, well the Haste people built a usable GUI in not very long at all. And they wern't all master Haskell hackers.
23:54:05 <sethk> aleator, sounds like perhaps something that is conceptually sound but not executed as well as you would like (since you said you aren't comfortable with it)
23:54:36 <boegel> w00 !
23:54:46 <dcoutts> morning boegel
23:54:51 <boegel> hey dcoutts
23:55:00 <Cale> I think there's a lot of potential for gui programming to be easy in Haskell. I haven't done much of it, since the kinds of programs that I write tend to be the sort where ghci is more than enough of a user interface :)
23:55:29 <Cale> But I've tried wxHaskell, and that was reasonably pleasant.
23:55:51 <sethk> Cale, I don't know.  The code I've seen seems to degenerate into something that is indistinguishable from a large C switch statement on message type
23:56:16 <Korollary> dcoutts: I am not a gui guy either, so how about the 1500 man-hours figure ? Is that considered short ?
23:56:27 <Cale> sethk: with wxHaskell?
23:56:47 <sethk> I'll have to check.  I was looking at some code a few days ago.
23:56:52 <dcoutts> sethk, it's not a message dispatch style, you hook up specific events with closures to run when the event happens
23:57:15 <dcoutts> sethk, however you're right that we still needs better ways of managing state in GUI apps
23:57:26 <sethk> dcoutts, what I was looking at was message dispatch style code, absolutely.  Not that this is the only way to do it.
23:57:43 <Cale> I find that the gtk2 bindings look a bit too C-ish for me -- it would be really nice to have a decent GUI combinator library built on top of them.
23:57:44 <sethk> It was someone on the channel here a few days ago.  I don't know if anybody logs this stuff.  :)
23:57:47 <dcoutts> Korollary, 1500 man-hours figure? I'm not sure what you mean?
23:58:00 <Korollary> dcoutts: http://haste.dyndns.org:8080/member.php
23:58:01 <z0d> sethk: cmeme logs channel traffic
23:58:11 <z0d> also, clog does too
23:58:28 <dcoutts> Cale, yes indeed it would be nice, we'd love some help in designing/implementing such a thing
23:58:43 * dcoutts confesses to being a Gtk2Hs developer
23:59:17 * Korollary hits dcoutts with duplicate bug reports
23:59:25 <sethk> dcoutts, I would like to participate in that.  Honestly, though, I've not come up with an approach I consider satisfactory
23:59:51 <dcoutts> Korollary, no that was not short, Haste was quite a big student project
23:59:52 <Cale> there was a really nice Haskell library along with some papers for doing configuration dialogs in particular
