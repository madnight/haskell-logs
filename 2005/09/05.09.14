00:35:05 <shapr> jiihaa
00:35:25 <boegel> y0 shapr
00:35:40 <shapr> y0, I'm packing up my computer to take to my new apartment! w00!
00:35:43 <boegel> shapr: I think you should lobby for more people to join the lambdabot contest in #haskell-blah
00:35:46 <boegel> w00 !
00:35:59 <boegel> you're packing it while working on it ? impressive
00:36:06 <shapr> Yeah, it is!
00:36:10 <shapr> cya later!
00:39:04 <luqui> Not in scope: `%'
00:39:06 <luqui> what?
00:39:14 <luqui> oh
00:39:16 * luqui is an idiot
00:39:28 <Muad_Dibber> :)
00:40:05 * boegel is glad luqui said so himself:
00:40:07 <boegel> :P
01:24:03 * Lemmih can't remember the questions.
01:24:55 <dons> well, i applied your patches Lemmih, thanks.
01:26:54 <dcoutts> dons, so Lemmih had the idea that all the plugins could be built as cabal packages, ie one GHCi .o file rather than a bunch of .o files
01:27:19 <dcoutts> we thought this had a number of advantages
01:27:29 <dons> yes, this has some good advantages
01:27:44 <dons> loading an archive of .o files is much faster
01:27:49 <dons> and doesn't require chasing .hi files
01:27:59 <dons> as we can use loadPackage rather than load
01:28:14 <dons> this is the approach Yi takes, and it is very fast
01:28:36 <dcoutts> and it allows us to use deps on other packages and C .so libs etc
01:28:44 <dons> yep.
01:28:59 <dons> Lemmih, your .5s load time seems very bad. only pdynload should be that slow
01:29:15 <dons> (as it is running a typechecker prior to the load)
01:29:16 <dcoutts> and it gives us a convenient metadata format for plugins
01:29:23 <dons> yeah, i like that idea!
01:29:27 <dcoutts> since it gives author, description etc
01:29:34 <dons> and a distribution system
01:29:37 <dcoutts> yes
01:29:47 <dcoutts> and it allows plugins to be built seperately
01:30:03 <dons> good. this is a good idea.
01:30:16 <dcoutts> in fact we were going to make even the static core a library package so that other plugins can link against it
01:30:32 <dcoutts> since the static core provides the plugin loading features
01:30:43 <dons> hmm. not sure about that.
01:30:57 <dons> if plugin link against it, then the core will be dynamiically loaded, and statically linked
01:30:58 <dcoutts> and then Main.hs consists of: main = Hide.StaticCore.Main
01:31:14 <dcoutts> oh, hmm
01:31:23 <dons> the better way is to pass, at runtime, the code from the static core through to the dynamic main in a bundle
01:31:36 <dons> pass a tuple containing any plugin loading functions you need
01:31:38 <dcoutts> how do you access the plugin loading interface from the dynamic modules?
01:31:41 <dons> this is how lambdabot and yi work
01:31:42 <dcoutts> oh ok I see
01:31:48 <dons> a call back
01:31:53 <dcoutts> right yes
01:32:11 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok I was wrong :-)
01:32:22 <dons> so you can have, say, reload, or even reboot() -- unload everything and load the latest versions
01:32:42 <dcoutts> dons, this is a GHCi limitation thing isn't it? that it can't share the already loaded version
01:32:51 <dons> yep
01:32:55 <dons> but we get a benefit
01:32:57 <dcoutts> ie having to load HSbase.o twice
01:33:13 <dcoutts> what's the benefit?
01:33:14 <dons> dynamic code can pass its state back into the static code via these call backs
01:33:26 <dons> so state gets preserved over module swapping
01:33:33 <Blownose> how do i pick a certain letter from a list by index ? Like if i want  letter 2 in "abcdefg" ?
01:33:34 <dcoutts> oh yes
01:33:55 <dcoutts> Blownose, "abcdefg" !! 2
01:34:01 <dons> @eval "abcdefg" !! 2
01:34:03 <lambdabot> 'c'
01:34:04 <Blownose> ok :)
01:34:09 <dcoutts> Blownose, but it's a 0-based index
01:34:14 <gour> hi folks!
01:34:17 <Blownose> ok thanks
01:34:19 <dcoutts> yo gour
01:34:20 <dons> like all good computer science indicies
01:34:24 <gour> just a short chime in...
01:34:32 <gour> congrats guys!!!
01:34:34 <dcoutts> dons, indeed
01:34:39 <int-e> dons is a C programmer at heart? hehe.
01:34:41 * int-e ducks.
01:34:44 <dons> gour! we have a fix for amd64 hs-plugins
01:34:47 <gour> the ball (hiDE) is rolling :-))
01:34:48 <dcoutts> gour, add your name to the hIDE wiki page
01:34:54 <gour> already did
01:34:58 <dons> juhp spotted it, and we'll have a fix in soon
01:34:59 <dcoutts> cool
01:35:04 <gour> dons: is it in repo?
01:35:20 <gour> dons: great
01:35:21 <dons> not yet, we need to add a little bit of cpp to work out the word size first
01:35:32 <dons> soon soon, but we have tested this and it works.
01:35:37 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I've got a GUI mockup
01:35:53 <juhp> dons: great :)
01:36:32 <dcoutts> Lemmih, it's based rather on the eclipse UI concept, and somewhat on Haste,Anjuta and every other IDE out there. They all use much the same layout
01:36:40 <gour> is hIDE official or we are going to have a contest?
01:36:42 <dons> dcoutts, are people of the opinion we should have full "dynamic apps from  the ground up"-style module hot swapping perserving state?
01:36:59 <dons> a la Yi's :reboot ?
01:37:11 <dcoutts> dons, I'm not sure of the need to hot swap & preserve state
01:37:21 <dons> I think if we have a static booter, we get this basically for free though
01:37:29 <dcoutts> that's fine then
01:37:32 <juhp> gour: just append "64" to 0x1face in hs-plugins/src/Language/Hi/Binary.hs
01:37:53 <dons> a reload at runtime becomes a reload :: State -> IO (), and the loaded module gets the old state when loaded
01:38:11 <dons> 10 extra lines of code, 100x cooler ;)
01:39:06 <dcoutts> Lemmih, but a GUI for an extensible IDE also has to be rather general rather than fixed function like some simple IDEs, hence the eclipse UI guidelines are useful inspiration
01:39:42 <dcoutts> dons, sure, we'll see how it works out
01:40:05 <dcoutts> dons, so wha'ts the use-case for an IDE to hot swap plugins?
01:40:32 <dcoutts> it makes it easier to develop plugins if the IDE does not need to be shut down
01:40:49 <dcoutts> but that's a somewhat fringe case
01:40:58 <dcoutts> anything more useful?
01:41:55 <dons> configuration
01:41:56 <dcoutts> when we reload, must we reload all plugins or can we do one at a time?
01:42:06 <ProfTeggy> G'day all.
01:42:07 <dons> no, we can reload them individually
01:42:11 <dcoutts> ok
01:42:27 <dcoutts> but when something unloads it needs to do the inverse of when it loads
01:42:37 <dcoutts> ie unregister all the hooks it's ever registered
01:42:55 <dons> ah, ok. but a swap shouldn't need to do this
01:43:04 <dcoutts> hmm
01:43:30 <dcoutts> it just reaquires all the references to the hooks that were registered before
01:43:33 <dcoutts> ?
01:44:06 <dons> oh, I see. so hooks are functions in the plugin registered in the system
01:44:12 <dons> ?
01:44:46 <dcoutts> yeah, so eg a refactoring tool might register a bunch of menu entries in the GUI shell
01:45:22 <dons> ok, so they'd be unregistered, then the new version would reregister. that would be safest
01:45:29 <dcoutts> there are may ways that plugins will set up callbacks between each other
01:45:48 <dons> having persistent state in plugins has been useful in lambdabot, so i imagine we will need this
01:46:04 <dons> i.e. tables for function names to their types
01:46:05 <dcoutts> it means we'll need to track all these hooks
01:46:06 <kosmikus> hi ProfTeggy
01:46:18 <ProfTeggy> Hi Andes!
01:46:24 <ProfTeggy> oergs, Andres
01:46:31 <dons> that data would not have to be reconstructed over a reload in the hotswapping scheme i'm suggesting
01:46:43 <dons> it doesn't require any changes to the framework, though
01:47:25 <dcoutts> dons, so lambdabot has a concept of a plugin/module tag?
01:47:35 <dcoutts> eg for getting per-module config?
01:47:39 <dons> yep
01:47:56 <dcoutts> ie we have one config subsystem and plugins use it, but must pass their plugin id
01:48:37 <dcoutts> and the config subsystem deals with keeping the different plugins config data
01:48:41 <dons> yep
01:48:56 <dons> you'll want to checkout the Module class, and MODULE existential type in lambdabot
01:49:06 <dcoutts> ok
01:49:18 <dcoutts> so what do you mean by configuration that is loaded as a dynamic module?
01:49:30 <dcoutts> that's things like lexer specs etc?
01:49:31 <dons> MODULES are kind of ML-style functors for treating modules as values, and managing them
01:49:48 <dcoutts> sounds reasonable
01:49:56 <dons> yeah, I reckon our configuration language should be haskell, which we load as plugins
01:50:00 <dons> like Config.hs in Yi
01:50:41 <dons> use a record type to override default values from a .hs file, that gets loaded (and may be reloaded) dynamically
01:50:49 <dcoutts> dons, hmm, however some config changes dynamically, and could be shared between parts of the program
01:51:21 <dcoutts> I was thinking of something more traditional that maps to gconf/win32 registey/text files/whatever
01:51:31 <dons> you reload a config plugin, extract its value, and stick that into the global state
01:51:49 <dons> thus the global state/registry whatever can get reconfigured dynamically
01:52:46 <dons> does that make sense? this is how (re)configuratoin works in yi, btw
01:53:00 <dcoutts> ok, I'll have to look at the yi code in more detail
01:53:10 <dons> you can, for example, change the editor colour scheme, by changing fields in a record value in Config.hs
01:53:30 <dons> yi notices, and recompiled then reloads the plugin, dynamically changing the gui configuration
01:54:07 <dcoutts> hmm, something like gconf is more direct, no recompiling/reloading etc
01:54:33 <dcoutts> you just listen to changes in a config value and you get notified whenever something changes
01:55:01 <dons> how were you thinking this would be done ?
01:55:02 <dcoutts> mind you its quite a nice idea to base it on plugin reloadign to change the config values
01:55:16 <dcoutts> it seems a bit heavyweight though
01:55:50 <dcoutts> I ought to go, I've got a doctors appointment, we'll come back to this no doubt.
01:55:52 <dons> it doesn't feel heavy weight in practice. the config files just become extra plugins loaded at startup, and reloaded on demmand
02:00:59 <nothingmuch> what's a nice to compute mathematical function that is quite hard to compute but not insane (e.g. ackerman)
02:05:25 <int-e> nice but hard? hrm.
02:05:49 <jedi`> anyone in here know relational schemas?
02:07:04 <musasabi> yes.
02:07:23 <musasabi> Of course depends on what particular thing you are interested in.
02:08:35 <Cale> nothingmuch: The sum of divisors function.
02:09:26 <ski> Cale : i've heard that called the sigma function
02:09:30 <Cale> ski: yeah
02:10:10 * ski used to calculate tables of "decay sequences" (where decay n = sigma n - n)
02:11:28 <ski> @lambda decaySequence 12
02:11:29 <lambdabot> [12, 16, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0]
02:13:10 <juhp> dons: ok - darcs sent you the patch
02:14:00 <juhp> dons: hadn7t realised that WORD_SIZE_IN_BITS was defined in MachDeps.h...
02:14:34 <dons> yep, that's the one I wanted. cheers
02:14:42 <juhp> np :)
02:17:05 <gour> juhp: i had some troubles after today's upgrade to cabal-1.1.3
02:17:24 <gour> juhp: now it's resolved and I built hs-plugins again
02:17:44 <gour> juhp: but after running yi, i got:
02:17:54 <gour> ./yi-inplace: line 2:  3784 Segmentation fault      /home/gour/repos/yi/yi_ -B/home/gour/repos/yi $*
02:19:09 <gour> so, yi segfaults...
02:19:26 <gour> dons: ping
02:22:08 <Lemmih> Rebuilding yi might fix it.
02:22:29 <gour> i did it
02:22:56 <gour> lambabot is up, however
02:23:48 <dons> gour, yes, it is known that yi segfaults. it is not known why.
02:23:54 <dons> you'll have to use yi-static
02:24:07 <dons> but you get no dynamic extensibility :/
02:24:12 <gour> ok, but yi is the real thing
02:24:21 <dons> ./yi-inplace is, yep
02:24:36 <gour> yes, meant that one
02:29:08 <aleator> I've got ghc complains "Could not find module `C2HS'" even after installing c2hs-0.14.1. Is there some trick that needs to be done?
02:29:48 <Lemmih> c2hs is a library?
02:30:53 <aleator> Yes.. Part of it at least.
02:31:12 <aleator> I've run setup.hs install and such..
02:33:15 <Cale> aleator: --make ?
02:33:29 <Cale> aleator: Or possibly --package c2hs or some such
02:34:34 <aleator> Tried.. No good.
02:34:52 <Lemmih> What modules does c2hs expose?
02:37:27 <aleator> None.. If I read the .cabal correctly (Exposed-modules tag, right?)
02:37:44 <Lemmih> Not much of a library then.
02:38:19 <aleator> Well, It supplies a C2HS.hs and stuffs it into /usr/local/lib..
02:39:20 <aleator> Well.. Seems to work if C2Hs is linked to my working directory.. How do I tell ghc to find it where it is supposed to be?
02:40:07 <Lemmih> Is the package registered?
02:42:09 <aleator> How do I find out?
02:42:18 <Lemmih> ghc-pkg list
02:42:46 <aleator> no..
02:46:52 <ProfTeggy> ski, is your nick derived from the categorical combinators or from winter sports?
02:47:29 <int-e> ProfTeggy: well he understood the remark that it could be shortened to just 'sk' - maybe that's a hint *g*
02:47:42 <ProfTeggy> :-)
02:48:24 * ski grins
02:49:10 <int-e> ProfTeggy: did you see my example for a case where head.sort l does not equal minimum l yesterday (for an instance of Ord that's not a partial ordering - the point was to show that the computation underneath is different, not to do a meaningful computation)
02:49:23 <kowey> anyone here go by gwright outside the channel?
02:49:42 <kowey> or rather, has anyone written a haskell DarwinPorts Portfile
02:49:59 <ProfTeggy> int-e, I must have missed that
02:51:11 <int-e> @eval let cmp (a,_) (_,b) = compare a b; l = [(1,1),(1,1),(0,1),(1,0)] in (Data.List.minimumBy cmp l, head $ Data.List.sortBy cmp l)
02:51:17 <lambdabot> ((1,0),(1,1))
02:51:31 <int-e> ProfTeggy: that's the one :)
02:52:09 <ProfTeggy> int-e, that's a rather contrived ordering. ;-)
02:52:43 <int-e> ProfTeggy: of course. If it were a partial ordering the results would in fact be identical, because sort is a stable sort and minimum finds the first smallest element.
02:53:11 <ProfTeggy> Nice example, though
02:53:43 <int-e> ProfTeggy: and of course the example is tied to the implementation in the ghc libs.
02:57:36 <SickJacken> shouldnt minimumBY cmp return (0,1) ?
02:57:54 <SickJacken> i didnt follow the discussion,...so maybe im saying something stupid :D
02:58:21 <int-e> SickJacken: no, because according to the ordering, (1,1) *equals* (0,1).
02:58:36 <SickJacken> but (0,1) < (1,1) no?
02:58:56 <int-e> SickJacken: cmp is defined in the example
02:59:09 <SickJacken> yeah so (0,1) < (1,1)
02:59:35 <int-e> SickJacken: The comparison is done the other way though: (1,1) = (0,1)
02:59:36 <SickJacken> it depends on the order of the arguments in the evaluation of the cmp's right?
02:59:45 <int-e> yes.
03:00:02 <SickJacken> i dont know how ghc goes through the list when doing minimumby, so
03:00:14 <SickJacken> probably from left to right when i think about it :P
03:00:47 <int-e> yes, it does that
03:01:48 <ProfTeggy> SickJacken, let's say from head to tail (or car to cdr, in Lisp parlance) ;-)
03:05:30 <SickJacken> yeah sorry for my use of ambiguous terms like left or right :)
03:05:44 <SickJacken> its natural language
03:05:45 <SickJacken> :D
03:06:58 <Cale> I think left to right is fine for lists, seeing as they are displayed that way.
03:07:32 <ulfdoz> In Arabia, too?
03:08:27 <SickJacken> or in chinese
03:08:33 <SickJacken> maybe they are from top to bottom there :D
03:08:38 <Cale> heh
03:09:10 <Cale> I seem to recall that mathematics is still typeset from left to right in arabic, but I'm not certain about that.
03:09:42 <int-e> SickJacken: Don't forget Australia, they write them upside-down there ;-)
03:10:19 <SickJacken> hahah down under
03:11:50 <SickJacken> offtopic> does anyone here have experience with icecast/ices !?
03:27:46 <dcoutts> aleator, c2hs doesn't come with the c2hs lib anymore
03:28:12 <dcoutts> aleator, you're supposed to just cope the module into your source tree
03:28:29 <dcoutts> aleator, use c2hs --copy-library
03:28:42 <dcoutts> so it's not registered with ghc-pkg
03:29:02 <dcoutts> it means less dependencies, you don't need c2hs installed on the target machine that way
03:29:24 <dcoutts> though you may want to rename/edit the C2HS.hs module to fit your needs
03:29:34 <aleator> Ok, Thanks.. I'm just trying to cabalize something that uses c2hs..
03:29:59 <gour> dcoutts: everythni ik with the doc?
03:30:11 <musasabi> Or one might use c2hs without the C2HS module.
03:30:26 <gour> dcoutts: everythinh ok with the doc?
03:31:23 <dcoutts> gour, what doc?
03:31:39 <gour> dcoutts, doctor?
03:31:47 <dcoutts> oh yeah
03:32:00 <gour> fine
03:32:14 <gour> can u help me a bit with lambdabot?
03:32:16 <dcoutts> yeah I got squewered by a sea urchin in the sea in Croatia. My onw silly fault.
03:32:40 <dcoutts> so I've got a few little black spines in my big toe :-)
03:33:35 <dcoutts> the doc just told me it wasn't infected and the swelling is ok. And he gave me a couple specialy sharp surgical neatles to get the things out
03:33:38 <dcoutts> what fun
03:33:47 <gour> :-)
03:33:49 <ski> ouch
03:34:05 <dcoutts> gour, lambdabot? possibly
03:34:05 <gour> however, it means the sea was pure, i.e. clean
03:34:08 <dcoutts> ski, yeah
03:34:21 <dcoutts> gour, oh right, nice to know
03:34:33 <gour> tha't a proof
03:34:39 <earthy> um
03:34:40 <dcoutts> gour, the water was certainly clear
03:34:50 <gour> they are not present where water is polluted
03:34:52 <earthy> seawater tends to be a bad environment for bacteria to live in
03:35:22 * dcoutts reccomends Croatia's coast & islands for an excelent beach / snorkiling holiday
03:35:40 <earthy> hm. yet another spot on the list of 'places to visit'
03:35:49 * gour happy listening dcoutts
03:35:52 <dcoutts> and it's not expensive either
03:35:59 <earthy> maybe someone should hold an ICFP near the croation coast... :P
03:36:00 <dcoutts> and good food
03:36:10 <dcoutts> earthy, yeah, that'd be nice
03:36:15 <gour> vegetarian?
03:36:33 <gour> earthy: then i'd be able to participate ;)
03:36:36 <dblhelix> earthy: lunch?
03:36:46 <dcoutts> gour, yeah, so I had less choise, but my freinds at particularly well, lots of fish
03:37:09 <earthy> dblhelix: plan!
03:37:14 <gour> dcoutts: me too (vegetarian)
03:37:21 <dcoutts> gour, really? oh
03:37:33 <dcoutts> gour, I got the impression it was not that common
03:37:36 <gour> since '87
03:38:02 <gour> dcoutts: i must quickly go to shop buying something
03:38:08 * dcoutts has been vege sine '87 too
03:38:23 <gour> i'm quickly back for lambdabot
03:38:26 <dcoutts> ok
03:39:33 * dcoutts also reccomends Eastern Eurpoean tomatoes, thery're much tastier that what we get in Western Europe
03:40:01 * dcoutts will try to stop being so OT
03:40:55 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I've got a pic of a GUI mockup: http://haskell.org/~duncan/hIDE/hIDE%20main%20window.png
03:41:39 <tic> dcoutts, http://haste.dyndns.org:8080/screenshots/screenshot_windows_r500_2.png
03:41:55 <dcoutts> tic, ah yes haste
03:42:15 <dcoutts> tic, I was tring to build that, but it seems it doesn't like ghc-6.4
03:42:37 <dcoutts> tic, as you notice most IDE's look pretty similar these days :-)
03:42:46 <tic> dcoutts, indeed. :)'
03:42:52 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Nice.
03:42:57 <dcoutts> one thing I want to do differently however...
03:43:10 <dcoutts> I don't like the tabed notbook for open files
03:43:34 * aleator still wishes hIDE to have outlining mode.. Where you could have nodes such as "@compiler-messages" or "@comments" as well as code..
03:43:58 <dcoutts> in my experience from using VisualStudio (when I wrote code for a living) you have var to many open files for the tab metafore to be of any use
03:44:06 <dcoutts> var/far
03:44:13 <dcoutts> var to/far too
03:44:27 <Muad_Dibler> i want a real time spellchecker on irc ;P
03:44:53 <dcoutts> I think it ought to appear to the user that all the files are open and can be browsed
03:45:02 <pejo> Muad_Dibler, flyspell mode?
03:45:34 <dcoutts> the only reason to track open files is if they have been modified and need saving.
03:45:44 * cjb runs 1920x1200, and doesn't understand this "too many tabs" idea.
03:46:09 <dcoutts> if you've got more than 20 files open it gets silly, even on a large screen
03:46:24 * liyang runs 80x48, and is perfectly happy with that. :p~~~
03:46:26 <dcoutts> eg browsing fptools would get silly
03:46:40 <ski> file tabs shoudl wrap around to next line
03:46:54 <dcoutts> ski, that's not a good UI system
03:47:03 <ski> possibly not :)
03:47:09 <dcoutts> ski, the UI designer people reccomend agaisnt that
03:47:27 <ski> ok, any specific reason ?
03:47:54 <dcoutts> because the tabs have to jump around
03:48:10 <ski> depends, i think
03:48:16 <dcoutts> or otherwise you loose the connection between the open tab and the page it exposes
03:48:27 <dcoutts> you want to beable to "jump to definition", look at the code and jump back easily
03:48:37 <dcoutts> and that will end up opening loads of modules
03:48:43 <liyang> They're okay when you have a small or fixed number of them. Tabs don't scale well.
03:48:53 <liyang> Split windows.
03:49:03 <aleator> What is the purpose of tabs anyway?
03:49:18 <liyang> To confuse and confound the poor users.
03:49:25 <dcoutts> so the right thing I think is for the UI to make the user think that all files are "open" and easily available
03:49:38 <dcoutts> just selct it from the modules/files tree
03:49:58 <dcoutts> and make it easy like a web browser to go back and forth between recently selected files
03:50:01 <ski> dcoutts : maybe one need some way of seeing where unsaved modifications have been made, then
03:50:08 <dcoutts> ski, yes exactly
03:50:14 <gour> Lemmih: great to see some shots :-)
03:50:18 <aleator> How about the tree?
03:50:21 <dcoutts> tha't the only place where these things need to be tracked
03:50:29 <ski> like .. some files in this directory have unsaved modifications
03:50:44 <ndm> typically * after the filename is used to indicate modifciation
03:50:59 <dcoutts> ndm, ues that would be one part of it
03:51:01 <ski> dcoutts : i use tabs in web browsers ..
03:51:05 <Lemmih> gour: eh?
03:51:13 <Muad_Dibler> i use tabs in a lot of places
03:51:27 <dcoutts> however in a large source tree you'll lose which files are modifed and unsaved
03:51:27 <gour> Lemmih: it's great to see hiDE happening
03:51:29 <Muad_Dibler> infact i like tabs if you don't have to many documents open
03:51:36 * ski often has 30 or so tabs open in browser
03:51:49 <ndm> i have a GUI for WinHaskell as well now, http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/projects/winhaskell.php
03:51:55 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, exaclty that's the place where tabs work
03:51:58 <ndm> well not really a mockup, thats the actual thing running
03:52:04 <dcoutts> ndm, cool
03:52:05 <Muad_Dibler> dcoutts: so you need to tag the directories which have modified files in their source tree
03:52:40 <dcoutts> in the screenshot I posted I have an extra tab which lists the modified but unsaved files
03:52:55 <dcoutts> that's the "Open" tab, next to the files & modules tabs
03:53:10 <Muad_Dibler> what screen shot where? :P
03:53:14 * Muad_Dibler just bumped in
03:53:20 <dcoutts> http://haskell.org/~duncan/hIDE/hIDE%20main%20window.png
03:53:32 <ndm> dcoutts, can you explain the difference between the 4 tabs on teh left
03:53:38 <ndm> modules vs files etc.
03:53:39 <dcoutts> ndm, sure...
03:53:46 <gour> Lemmih: sorry, it was dcoutts :-)
03:54:18 <dcoutts> modules are Haskell modules that sit in your source tree, files include everything else, text files, build files etc
03:54:47 <dcoutts> when coding you mostly want to just see the available modules
03:54:49 <ndm> what about alex files etc?
03:55:01 <ndm> i.e. does file.lex go in source or text
03:55:03 <dcoutts> when doing misc admin you want to see more sutff
03:55:06 <ndm> and does file.hs go anywhere
03:55:29 <ndm> (assuming file.hs was generated by alex)
03:55:39 <dcoutts> ndm, I expect that anything that is considered Haskell source code, including .chs. x .y etc modules would go under the modules tab
03:55:57 <ndm> what visual studio does is it has folders, a tree view
03:56:06 <dcoutts> and generated derived files, eg the .hs from a .x would not appear in the modules tab, but would appear in the files tab
03:56:10 <ndm> usually a source folder, a header folder, resources and other ones
03:56:30 <ndm> that way all the files are on one tab, but you can find just the source ones easily enough
03:56:37 <ndm> which is kind of the best of both worlds
03:56:51 <dcoutts> ndm, well the files tab will list all files, including source modules
03:57:13 <ndm> yeah, it just seems like quite a lot of tabs - removing some would be better i feel
03:57:16 <dcoutts> I think it's probably useful to have a view that is restricted to what you primerily edit when coding
03:57:30 <ndm> thats the beauty of a treeview, you just collapse the "others" folder
03:57:42 <ndm> and you get your restricted view, but with less distance to your full view
03:58:04 <dcoutts> ndm, yeah I guess, but in my esperience with that is that you need to scroll up and down to colapse/expand the category you are interested in
03:58:33 <dcoutts> ndm, but yes it could be done either way, we can experiment
03:58:45 <ndm> dcoutts, only if your categories are too specific - if you have source, generated, resources, other it would probably work
03:58:52 <ndm> yeah, needs a test in the end
03:58:54 <dcoutts> that was my personal opinion from using some IDEs
03:58:57 <ndm> what about hte tools tab?
03:59:15 <dcoutts> ndm, that'd be for brining up various other tools
03:59:30 <ndm> so like a plugin repository list thing?
03:59:35 <dcoutts> but it'd be a bit more extensable than one honking big tools menu bar
03:59:42 <Muad_Dibler> cant you create it as a plugin?
03:59:55 <Muad_Dibler> so users can choose between treeviews and such?
04:00:06 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, yes everyting is as a plugin
04:00:36 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, actually that'd be a nice idea to have everything in one virtual rooted tree and allow users to make tabs that correspond to subtrees
04:00:49 <dcoutts> eg /tools, /files, /modules etc
04:01:03 <Muad_Dibler> yeh
04:01:05 <dcoutts> and so you can have just one tree with everyting
04:01:18 <dcoutts> or you can have tabs for the categories you find useful
04:01:41 <dcoutts> or even open a new window rooted somewhere further down your source tree
04:02:35 <dcoutts> the arbitary root idea is quite nice, it was something I tried to experiment with before with a hIDE prototype a couple years ago
04:02:56 <Muad_Dibler> but failed?
04:03:24 <dcoutts> but I got side tracked into developing Gtk2Hs instead
04:03:39 <dcoutts> when Gtk2Hs 1.0 is out I'd like to spend more time on hIDE
04:03:57 <dcoutts> but actually now we have the better technology for doing an IDE anyway
04:04:01 <Muad_Dibler> Gtk2Hs being like wxHaskell i suppose?
04:04:15 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, yeah but with Gtk+ obviously
04:04:19 <Muad_Dibler> yeah ;)
04:04:31 * aleator still whines about making the treeview user manageable outline :/
04:04:35 <dcoutts> it's got a similar syntax too
04:04:51 <Muad_Dibler> probably the same problems while implementing it also?
04:05:05 <dcoutts> not sure what you mean
04:05:30 <dcoutts> aleator, I probaby just don't "get it" on that issue yet
04:05:41 <dcoutts> aleator, I'll try leo
04:06:03 <aleator> dcoutts: Thanks.
04:06:12 <dcoutts> aleator, my prejudiced suspicion however is that such a thing might not be to everyone's taste
04:06:24 <Blownose> how do i delete the first char in a string? ?
04:06:25 <Muad_Dibler> dcoutts: well i mean, if after its finished you give a talk about the implementation of Gtk2Hs it will probably look like talks about wxHaskell
04:06:28 * aleator feels bit sad that best he can contribute is whining :)
04:06:32 <dcoutts> Blownose, tail
04:06:51 <Blownose> ok thanks
04:06:55 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, oh right, yeah, similar
04:07:09 <dcoutts> only better :-)
04:07:10 <aleator> dcoutts: Perhaps so. But still. It is worth checking out.
04:07:17 <dcoutts> aleator, yes
04:07:26 <rep> http://people.freebsd.org/~ssouhlal/stuff/before.jpg
04:07:30 <rep> http://people.freebsd.org/~ssouhlal/stuff/after.jpg
04:07:43 <Muad_Dibler> dcoutts: i'm always interested in "why is my program better that the other ones" papers :)
04:08:13 <dcoutts> Muad_Dibler, :-)
04:08:30 <dcoutts> in this case much of it depends on the arguments over Gtk+/wx/Qt/etc
04:09:06 <dcoutts> which are well hashed out in other forums
04:09:27 <ProfTeggy> rep, rollback, if you ask me
04:09:30 <ProfTeggy> ;-)
04:09:45 <rep> heh
04:12:07 <Muad_Dibler> anyway
04:12:10 * Muad_Dibler gotta go to uni
04:12:11 <Muad_Dibler> bbl tonight
04:12:14 <dcoutts> bye
04:13:44 <juhp> gour: yea I found that segv too earlier
04:14:56 <gour> juhp: any idea?
04:16:15 <dcoutts> @botsnack
04:16:16 <lambdabot> :)
04:16:34 <gour> @botsnack
04:16:35 <lambdabot> :)
04:17:55 <juhp> gour: not really, but Don is thinking over it - I see I misunderstood what he said earlier - thought he had a fix for it already... :)
04:18:53 <juhp> I sent him a backtrace (in ncurses)
04:19:43 <gour> great, i'd like to test real stuff
04:20:24 <juhp> me too...
04:20:41 <juhp> gour: anyway plugins "make check" works :)
04:20:55 <juhp> which is very nice news
04:23:23 <gour> i have to check out
04:26:02 <dcoutts> btw for people interested in hIDE development: darcs get http://scannedinavian.com/~lemmih/hIDE
04:30:58 <gour> what about changing the name to avoid typing Caps?
04:32:03 <dcoutts> gour, I'm open to name changes
04:32:13 <dcoutts> anyone got any good ideas?
04:32:34 <gour> hs
04:32:45 <gour> Haskell Studio
04:32:48 <gour>  :-))
04:32:54 <dcoutts> hah!
04:33:23 <dcoutts> gour, you could add a section to the wiki so people can suggest names
04:33:32 <dcoutts> though I'm just editing it at the moment
04:33:38 <dcoutts> i'll be done in a sec
04:33:47 <gour> then, just do it ;)
04:34:36 <gour> ok
04:35:57 <dcoutts> gour, done
04:39:28 <gour> dcoutts, done
04:39:35 <dcoutts> ok
04:39:39 <gour> should i put my suggestion 1st?
04:40:21 <dcoutts> yeah
04:43:53 <gour> done
04:44:36 <dcoutts> :-)
04:45:05 <dcoutts> anyone with a better name please suggest it ;-)
04:45:30 <dcoutts> poll: what you call an IDE for Haskell?
04:45:31 <Lemmih> s/better//
04:46:11 * gour melts in joy 
04:46:59 <dcoutts> I've aready got some icons/logos for "hIDE" that I made a couple years ago
04:47:11 <dcoutts> http://haskell.org/~duncan/hIDE/
04:47:28 <dcoutts> pretty simple ones realy
04:48:08 <dcoutts> I quite likes the tranparency effect, it looked good on a non-white background
04:50:06 <dons> @where hide
04:50:06 <lambdabot> http://scannedinavian.com/~lemmih/hIDE
04:50:36 <dcoutts> nice
04:51:31 <dcoutts> is @where for darcs/code things or for websites? it might be btter to point at the wiki (which has a link to the darcs repo)
04:51:41 <dcoutts> @help where
04:51:42 <lambdabot>  @where <key>, return element associated with key
04:51:58 <dons> yeah, what's the wiki link?
04:52:07 <dcoutts> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
04:52:18 <dons> @where+ hide http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
04:52:19 <lambdabot> hide ~> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
04:52:28 <dcoutts> ah that's how it works
04:52:38 <dcoutts> @where hide
04:52:39 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
04:52:42 <dcoutts> @where hIDE
04:52:43 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
04:52:45 <dcoutts> nice
04:53:21 <Lemmih> @vixen What do you think of hIDE?
04:53:22 <lambdabot> i dunno...
04:54:01 <dcoutts> @vixen oh come on, tell us what do you think of hIDE?
04:54:02 <lambdabot> yeah
04:54:15 <dcoutts> @vixen you're so unhelpful sometimes
04:54:17 <lambdabot> why not always?
04:54:34 <dcoutts> @vixen yeah, maybe that too
04:54:35 <lambdabot> just maybe?
04:54:43 <dcoutts> @vixen ba!
04:54:45 <lambdabot> :)
05:00:33 * SamB wonders what his computer is doing that is using about 1 K/s
05:04:12 <beelsebob_> what's wrong with using about 1K/s
05:04:43 <SamB> well, besides the fact that I'm on 56k, there is this fact that I don't know what it is!
05:04:53 <beelsebob_> it's me!
05:05:04 <beelsebob_> it's plausably just IRC
05:05:13 <SamB> too steady for IRC, methinks
05:05:34 <SamB> IRC has flurries of activity, you know?
05:05:50 <beelsebob_> well, are you seeing them?
05:06:01 <beelsebob_> you are after all on IRC... so you should see it's traffic
05:06:15 <SamB> I don't usually
05:08:37 <beelsebob_> kill processes until the traffic stops?
05:09:23 <SamB> hmm, looks like someone is trying to get in through ssh...
05:12:47 <SamB> its trying to crack username and password
05:13:02 <SamB> s/someone/something/
05:15:23 <beelsebob_> how droll
05:15:30 <beelsebob_> you using ssh?
05:16:29 <SamB> hmm, what happenned to non-us.debian.org?
05:16:48 <SamB> yeah, I use ssh a fair bit
05:17:20 <beelsebob_> are you now?
05:17:24 <SamB> @google debian non-us
05:17:24 <Lunar^> SamB: no need for it
05:17:26 <lambdabot> http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/
05:17:35 <beelsebob_> as in... set your firewall to hide it just now
05:17:43 <SamB> no
05:20:57 <SamB> hmm, how do I do that?
05:21:19 * SamB is running linux 2.6
05:21:41 <Lemmih> How about stopping your sshd?
05:22:31 <gour> or non-standard port, at least
05:22:45 <int-e> beelsebob_: ?? either the service is needed then you can't hide it (at least not easily - look at modern root kits for ideas for doing that anyway) or you don't need it then you can do what Lemmih suggested and stop the service.
05:26:13 * SamB just stops ssh for now and hopes he doesn't freeze X anytime soon
05:26:28 <Itkovian> why would X freeze?
05:26:58 <beelsebob_> int-e: unless it's needed on an internal network
05:27:11 <SamB> okay, hope some app doesn't freeze after locking input
05:31:43 <ndm> dcoutts, ok, i darcs get'd hIDE
05:31:50 <ndm> how do i go about compiling it up?
05:32:03 <dcoutts> there are .cabal files for each component
05:32:11 <dcoutts> and Setup.lhs files
05:32:18 <dcoutts> so do the cabal style build
05:32:49 <dcoutts> runhaskell Setup.lhs configure, or ghc --make Setup.lhs -o setup; ./setup configure
05:32:58 <dcoutts> configure then build
05:33:03 <dcoutts> then ask Lemmih! :-)
05:33:26 <dcoutts> ndm, and yu need the latest darcs version of hs-plugins
05:33:41 <ndm> ok, will work on that then
05:34:01 <dcoutts> sorry there's no better build system yet, the project is less than 24 hours old :-)
05:35:37 <Lemmih> Will there ever be a better build system than Cabal?
05:37:05 <beelsebob_> yes... hamke
05:37:09 <beelsebob_> hmake*
05:37:33 <Lemmih> Why is hmake better than Cabal?
05:38:07 <ndm> lemmih, it just works (TM)
05:38:20 <ndm> hmake File, and i can guarantee a binary at the end
05:38:36 <gour> Lemmih: after building hIDE i executed: runhaskell Setup.lhs install
05:38:43 <beelsebob_> that and hmake -hat File
05:38:44 <Lemmih> You don't want a binary most of the time.
05:38:59 <gour> Lemmih: and it report: Installing: /usr/local/lib/hIDE-0.1.0/ghc-6.4.1.20050801 & /usr/local/bin hIDE-0.1.0...
05:39:08 <Lemmih> gour: Using it in-place is probaby easier.
05:39:13 <Lemmih> (that's what I'm doing)
05:39:20 <gour> Lemmih: but nothing ends in /usrlocal/lib ?
05:39:42 <gour> although binary is in /usr/local/bin?
05:39:52 <Lemmih> hIDE is not a library.
05:40:25 <gour> Lemmih: it is a package..
05:40:32 <Lemmih> No, it's a binary.
05:40:33 <integral> I've got a wee problem with Data.Array.IArray.  amap allows me to map a function over the elements of the array, but I'd like my function to vary with the index, i -> e' -> e, too.  Any suggestions?
05:41:05 <gour> Lemmih: ah, ok
05:50:38 <ProfTeggy> integral, pair each array element with its index, then map the function over the pairs
05:51:39 <integral> ProfTeggy: ok, but how do I do the pairing in the first place?
05:52:05 <integral> is the best way really to just convert the array to a list of pairs and back again?
05:53:35 <ProfTeggy> "the best way" is rather abstract... it's a feasible way
05:54:00 <integral> hmm, doesn't look as bad as I thought: \m -> array (bounds m) (map f $ assocs m)
05:57:36 <dcoutts> Lemmih, by nothing better than cabal I mean cabal's great but it doens't deal with multiple packages that easily yet
05:58:38 <dcoutts> we might want a makefile to build all the packages/plugins with one easy command: make
05:58:57 <dcoutts> but not yet, it's not a problem really
05:59:16 <dcoutts> just some instructions to build & run would do
06:11:34 <Lemmih> gour: Trying running it?
06:13:00 <kowey> could i interest any mac users in testing out a wxhaskell DarwinPorts portfile?
06:13:02 <kowey> http://www.loria.fr/~kow/download/wxhaskell-port.tgz
06:13:03 * Lemmih realizes how grammatically wrong that sentence was.
06:16:26 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so I need to install the plugins right? since test2 deps on test1
06:16:41 <Lemmih> Yes.
06:16:47 <dcoutts> ok
06:17:01 <dcoutts> roll on register in-place support in cabal
06:17:24 <dcoutts> @summon SyntaxNinja
06:17:25 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
06:17:39 * dcoutts wishes @summon existed
06:18:22 <dblhelix> dcoutts: can you tell me how partial evaluation is done in ghc?
06:18:39 <dcoutts> dblhelix, it's not really done. That's how.
06:18:47 <dblhelix> :)
06:18:56 <dcoutts> dblhelix, what did you mean exactly?
06:19:49 <dblhelix> dcoutts: I wanted to know whether ghc does bta and, if it does, how the results of the analysis are used
06:20:38 <dcoutts> dblhelix, no ghc does not to a bta, the only related thing it does is a strictness analysis
06:20:47 <Lemmih> dcoutts: How about using tabs for projects like other IDE's have tabs for open files?
06:21:06 <dcoutts> Lemmih, for projects? how do you mean?
06:21:14 <dblhelix> dcoutts: do you think there's gain in doing a bta + pe
06:21:16 <dblhelix> ?
06:21:31 <dcoutts> dblhelix, sure
06:21:52 <dcoutts> dblhelix, no sure about doing it fully automatically however
06:22:02 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I would like to have serveral Cabal projects open in hIDE at the same time.
06:22:03 <gour> Lemmih: it does not build plug2
06:22:12 <dcoutts> dblhelix, my resaearch is on semi-autmatic PE for Haskell
06:22:34 <Lemmih> gour: How so?
06:22:45 <dcoutts> Lemmih, sure, they all exist in one source tree so that's fine. The question is how you build diffrent bits
06:22:47 <dblhelix> dcoutts: mine is on program analyses; currently strictness analysis and bta
06:23:19 <dcoutts> dblhelix, so you know how strictness analysis is related to bta? (because it confuses me sometimes)
06:24:15 <dblhelix> dcoutts: as of now, I only have a pragmatic view on the connection between those
06:24:18 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I expect that a build system thingy should notice all the .cabal files any their inter-dependencies and be able to do the right thing to rebuild everything or rebuild individual targets
06:24:29 <gour> Lemmih: 1st I run configure & build for hiDE, then baseApp, then plug1..
06:24:42 <gour> Lemmih: however 'build 'for plug2 gives:
06:24:46 <dblhelix> dcoutts: i.e., both can be done using boolean constraints etc.
06:24:51 <gour> Lemmih: Setup.lhs: cannot satisfy dependency hide-test1-any
06:24:55 <dcoutts> dblhelix, yes
06:25:02 <Lemmih> gour: Probably because you didn't install hide-test1.
06:25:14 <dblhelix> dcoutts: but I'm sure there is a more fundamental connection
06:25:18 <dcoutts> dblhelix, I sometimes think that bta is like a more powerful version of strictness analysis
06:25:38 <dcoutts> and then sometimes I think it is strictness analysis
06:25:47 <dcoutts> and then othertimes I'm just confused :-)
06:25:47 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Wouldn't that be weird for projects which aren't related?
06:25:56 <dblhelix> dcoutts: still, bta is usually regarded as being more simple than strictness
06:26:06 <dcoutts> Lemmih, presumably in that case they would not be in the same build tree
06:26:28 <dcoutts> dblhelix, really? it looked rather the other way around to me
06:26:35 <dblhelix> dblhelix: I'm now hitting some kind of wall when thinking about bta in the context of seperate compilation
06:27:09 <dcoutts> dblhelix, I'm working on a bta that I think works in the context of seperate compilation
06:27:19 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I'm currectly hacking on both hIDE and hs-plugins, and I would like hIDE to handle that case, too.
06:27:25 <Lemmih> (without spawning two instances)
06:27:57 <dcoutts> Lemmih, sure, I was thinking that each window has it's root in the filesystem, so differnt windows can look at different bits of the file system
06:27:59 <dblhelix> dcoutts: does it involve user-provided annotations?
06:28:23 <gour> Lemmih: ok, i built them & install them both
06:28:24 <beelsebob_> @where cpphs
06:28:25 <lambdabot> http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/
06:28:42 <dcoutts> Lemmih, but you're right we may end up needing a "project" abstraction because theres probably per-project metadata and config that we'll need to store
06:28:55 <gour> Lemmih: what parameter to give to hIDE to test them?
06:28:58 <dcoutts> dblhelix, yes, though they are entriely optional
06:29:16 <dblhelix> dcoutts: interesting
06:30:12 <Lemmih> gour: The first argument to hIDE is the package name of the dynamic main (hide-base-0.1.0) and the rest of the arguments are package names of plugins you want hIDE to load.
06:34:30 <gour> Lemmih: thanks, it works on amd64
06:35:01 <Lemmih> Cool.
06:35:44 <gour> i'm looking forward to test new features :-)
06:41:49 <dblhelix> dcoutts: do you have implementations of published btas available? it seems to me that the first thing one does after publishing a paper on bta is rm ./bta/src/*.*
06:45:36 <dcoutts> dblhelix, I'm just working on a paper so nothing published yet
06:47:17 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I don't get it running
06:47:19 <dcoutts> $ ./bin/hIDE hide-base
06:47:19 <dcoutts> hIDE: Unknown package: hide-base
06:47:35 <dcoutts> but it's installed and registered with ghc, ghc-pkg lists it
06:47:37 <Lemmih> Try hide-base-0.1.0
06:47:40 <dblhelix> dcoutts: I was referring to implementations of people that actually do have published... f.i. consel, glynn...
06:47:50 <dcoutts> Lemmih, that didn't work either
06:48:02 <dcoutts> dblhelix, ah, not i neer implemented those
06:48:14 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Same error?
06:48:25 * dcoutts is makeing lots of typos today
06:48:29 <dcoutts> Lemmih, yeah, same
06:48:37 <dcoutts> $ ./bin/hIDE hide-base-0.1.0
06:48:38 <dcoutts> hIDE: Unknown package: hide-base-0.1.0
06:48:48 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Did you install it globally?
06:48:52 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I registed in the user package collection, rather than gobal
06:49:10 <dcoutts> it needs to be in the global one?
06:49:11 <Lemmih> hIDE doesn't look in the local package conf, yet.
06:49:31 <dcoutts> oh right, is that our fault or the fault of hs-plugins?
06:51:04 <Lemmih> dcoutts: It's fixable without change to hs-plugins. What's the path to the local package conf?
06:51:54 <dcoutts> Lemmih, it's $HOME/.ghc/$PLATFORM-$GHC_VERSION/package.conf
06:51:59 <dcoutts> not so easy :-(
06:52:12 <dcoutts> eg for me thats: /home/duncan/.ghc/i386-linux-6.4.1.20050909/package.conf
06:52:47 <dcoutts> $HOME/.ghc/$ARCH-$OS-$GHC_VERSION/package.conf
06:52:53 <Igloo> Is that a gentoo thing or a ghc thing, dcoutts?
06:52:59 <dcoutts> a ghc thing
06:53:13 <Igloo> Hmm, OK
06:53:27 <dcoutts> Lemmih, hmm maybe I'll just go install globally :-)
06:54:05 <gour> that's what i did ;)
06:57:44 <dcoutts> yay
06:57:46 <dcoutts> $ ./bin/hIDE hide-base-0.1.0 hide-test1-0.1.0 hide-test2-0.1.0

06:57:53 <dcoutts> @yar
06:57:54 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: arr part yow
06:57:57 <dcoutts> @aar
06:57:58 <lambdabot> Aye
06:58:04 <dcoutts> @yow
06:58:06 <lambdabot> Treasure your spin cycle.
06:58:29 * dcoutts spells arr as yarr
06:59:00 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so next is that trivial GUI bit
06:59:19 <dcoutts> so we need that hook to transfer control when loading all plugins is done
06:59:46 <Lemmih> I'm about to make a 'hello-world' gui plugin.
06:59:58 <Lemmih> The hook is ready.
07:01:08 <dcoutts> cool, you've got the GUI code from gobby
07:03:48 <dcoutts> Lemmih, once that works, I can modify the hello-world plugin to load the GUI mockup I've got
07:04:38 <Lemmih> Hm, I don't have gtk2hs installed anymore /-:
07:06:22 <dcoutts> Lemmih, you can darcs get the latest development version
07:06:49 <dcoutts> using the darcs mirror that gour kindly set up for us
07:06:54 <dcoutts> let me find the url...
07:07:21 <dcoutts> darcs get http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/darcs/gtk2hs/
07:08:11 <Lemmih> Only two patches?
07:08:48 <Lemmih> autoreconf: "marcro 'AM_HCFLAGS' not found in library"
07:08:50 <gour> after initial import via tailor
07:08:52 <dcoutts> one is a massive intial import
07:09:18 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ah yes I should fix that, it's autoconf getting stricter
07:09:31 <dcoutts> Lemmih, just change AM_HCFLAGS to HCFLAGS in configure.ac
07:09:42 * dcoutts goes off to fix that
07:10:17 <dcoutts> Lemmih, however our darcs repo is not 'live' it only syncs once a day so you'll have to fix it locally for the moment
07:10:28 <dcoutts> btw what verison of autoconf have you got installed?
07:11:00 <Lemmih> 2.59
07:11:01 <gour> i can update repo after it's synced with devs
07:11:32 <gour> repo on SF
07:11:35 <dcoutts> gour, but there is still the SoruceForge anon cvs lag, we'd need to sunce with the SF dev cvs to do that
07:11:46 * boegel swears in a loud fashion
07:11:55 <gour> yes, i know that
07:12:05 <gour> what's the lag between the two?
07:13:12 <basti_> hi
07:13:47 <basti_> i'm trying to compile DBDirect (part of haskelldb) and I'm getting: ./build/ghc/libHShdb.a(MySQL.o):(.rodata+0x54): undefined reference to `DatabaseziHSQLziMySQL_connect_closure
07:13:51 <basti_> that's puzzling me
07:15:27 <Lemmih> What versions of HSQL and HaskellDB?
07:15:55 * basti_ looks up
07:16:13 <basti_> haskelldb 0.9
07:16:32 <basti_> hsql 1.6
07:16:51 <Lemmih> That wont work. Use HSQL-1.4.
07:17:09 <basti_> okay.
07:20:05 <bourbaki> moin
07:21:11 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Changing AM_HCFLAGS to HCFLAGS just made autoreconf complain about a lot of other stuff.
07:21:55 <dcoutts> Lemmih, like what? you're using autoreconf -i I hope
07:22:13 <dcoutts> somethings are just warning from other installed packages
07:22:33 <boegel> hey bourbaki
07:22:35 <gour> Lemmih: i do have problems in running autoreconf
07:22:42 <bourbaki> sup boegel? anything new?
07:22:55 <boegel> bourbaki: yeah, #haskell-blah ;)
07:22:57 * dcoutts curses autotools
07:23:03 <gour> and instead run manually auto-conf tools
07:23:06 <boegel> nothing code-wise though, I'm preparing my Phd proposal
07:23:47 <gour> one of reported autoreconf bugs waits a new release
07:24:42 <dcoutts> in my experinece the automake/autoconf behave very differently on different systems, though the configure & Makefiles they generate are very reliable
07:25:15 <dcoutts> but we do sometimes get bizarre errors on some systems when running autoconf/automake
07:25:36 <gour> true, although for some packages i manually run aclocal, automake...
07:26:16 <gour> so, autoreconf is a culprit, in my case
07:32:06 <dcoutts> Lemmih, any luck?
07:44:41 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I'm installing gtk2hs-0.9.8 instead.
07:47:56 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok
07:48:33 <dcoutts> Lemmih, eventually you'll need a later version but it's ok for now
07:48:55 <basti_> I sucked HSQL-1.4 from cvs, but the autoconf nonsense in there isn't complete
07:49:22 <basti_> i can't configure without an install-sh and when i get a random one it "can't run config.sub"
07:49:48 <dcoutts> is config.sub executable?
07:49:58 <basti_> there is no config.sub
07:50:06 <dcoutts> oh eait, it doesn't need to be executable
07:50:20 <dcoutts> configure usually needs a config.sub
07:50:31 <dcoutts> and config.guess
07:50:52 <basti_> there is neither :(
07:51:01 <int-e> basti_: automake -a should add missing standard files - I beieve install-sh is one of those
07:51:20 <SickJacken> would it be fair to say that most time in imperative program is spent iterating some form of loop
07:51:31 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I'm also having trouble with 0.9.8 /-:
07:51:53 <SickJacken> and THUS the logical step in parallelisation would be to try to execute iterations of some loop in parallel
07:52:40 <gour> Lemmih: what's the problem, same?
07:56:53 <Lemmih> gour: 'Not in scope: 'connectGeneric'' when compiling Gtk/Signals.chs.
07:57:19 <musasabi> SickJacken: that is only true for scienfific apps.
07:57:51 <dcoutts> Lemmih, you're using ghc-6.4.1?
07:58:56 <dcoutts> Lemmih, 0.9.8 wasn't tested with 6.4.1, 0.9.9 or the latest 0.9.9.5 should be ok
07:59:19 <dcoutts> btw, use ./configure --hcflags=-O0 for a quicker build
08:02:00 <cbus> hmm yawn
08:02:06 <cbus> *tries to write the dreaded substring function*
08:02:23 <kosmikus> why dreaded?
08:03:10 <vegai> why not?
08:03:46 <gour> cbus: some exercise?
08:04:49 <cbus> gour, not really
08:04:55 <cbus> i had that excercise about 2 years ago
08:05:05 <gour> cbus: :-)
08:05:07 <cbus> need to do some handlemen problem thingie for an algorithm course :)
08:05:13 <cbus> doing a bruteforce checker
08:05:20 <cbus> thats the first part of the lab
08:05:34 <gour> cbus:well, i'm on the exercise-level :-)
08:10:22 <olliej> muwhahahaha!!! i just compile GHC.{Base, Enum, Tuple} :)
08:10:27 <SickJacken> musasabi, would it be true for media code?
08:10:31 <SickJacken> i think it is
08:10:31 <olliej> s/compile/compiled
08:16:31 <musasabi> SickJacken: optimized decoders/encoders yes.
08:17:37 <musasabi> GHC does not have a concept of loops afaik.
08:24:21 <SickJacken> musasabi, no im sorry if it was misplaced in this channel indeed
08:24:38 <SickJacken> i meant in an imperative language, media code.
08:24:42 <basti_> heh if THAT will work lol
08:29:28 <dcoutts> Lemmih, btw everything is working for me now, I can make it bring up a GUI and then wait for the GUI to shotdown before quiting :-)
08:29:42 <dcoutts> ./bin/hIDE hide-base-0.1.0 hide-test1-0.1.0 hide-test2-0.1.0 hide-shell-0.1.0
08:30:04 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I'll send you the patch for hide-shell-0.1.0
08:30:19 <dcoutts> I'll make it use the new gUI mockup first
08:31:28 <basti_> Lemmih: HSQL 1.4 gives about 10x as many error messages :)
08:31:30 <basti_> oh the joys
08:31:44 <basti_> uhm
08:31:48 <basti_> maybe i should have made clean
08:37:20 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok that's done, it loads the UI mockup now
08:37:28 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Neat.
08:37:46 <Lemmih> basti_: Download my cabalization of HSQL-1.4 and HaskellDB.
08:38:18 <Lemmih> basti_: They work for sure.
08:38:34 <basti_> Lemmih: okay
08:38:53 <Lemmih> basti_: hackage.haskell.org/ModHackage/Hackage.hs
08:41:02 <dcoutts> Lemmih, sent, tell me if it turns up in a few minutes, I've been having some issues with my darcs send/mssmtp combo
08:41:51 <basti_> Lemmih: thats looking very good
08:42:16 <beelsebob_> YAY!
08:42:18 * beelsebob_ has working yhc
08:42:32 <ndm> woot for yhc
08:42:39 <ndm> (not that anyone here knows what yhc is)
08:42:48 <musasabi> yhc?
08:42:51 <Lemmih> What's yhc?
08:43:06 <musasabi> yet another haskell compiler?
08:43:06 <beelsebob_> york haskell compiler
08:43:07 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I got it.
08:44:38 <musasabi> beelsebob_: what kind of compiler is it (structure and goals) ?
08:44:54 <beelsebob_> musasabi: it's the working name for nhc2
08:45:31 <beelsebob_> it has a new back end and will have support for building tracing binaries
08:45:41 <ndm> musasabi, portable bytecode based, faster than hugs at exec, faster than ghc at compile
08:45:51 <ndm> (and slower than hugs at compile, slower than ghc at exec)
08:46:00 * basti_ sees flames coming out of his ghc

08:46:53 <CosmicRay> hwn is out, finally.
08:47:12 <dcoutts> Lemmih, oh good
08:47:57 <Igloo> beelsebob_: Who's writing it?
08:48:02 <dcoutts> Lemmih, tell me if you have any problems with the patch
08:48:07 <beelsebob_> igloo: Tom Shakell
08:48:16 <Igloo> Ah, cool
08:48:24 <basti_> is 4 minutes compile time ok for HaskellDB?
08:48:26 <basti_> o0
08:48:27 <Igloo> It's Shackell, incidentally (I was most disappointed to find out)
08:48:32 <pejo> ndm, is the goal a production compiler or is it to do nifty research?
08:48:39 <beelsebob_> heh... indeed it is
08:48:45 <dcoutts> Lemmih, the UI mockup probably requires Gtk+ 2.6 or later
08:49:03 <Igloo> Is there anything public yet?
08:49:24 <ndm> pejo, i guess a production compiler more than nifty research
08:50:20 <basti_> 6 minutes now
08:50:36 <ndm> Igloo, I  suppose http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/projects/winhaskell.php is the only public thing
08:50:50 <ndm> and that is just a screenshot which shows nothing of yhc
08:51:10 <beelsebob_> although XYhc is on it's way... or at least, I've created the XCode project
08:51:14 <Igloo> Windows as in MS, presumably?
08:51:29 <ndm> yep, indeed
08:51:36 <Igloo> Hmm, XCode sounds familiar, in a non-Haskell way
08:51:36 <ndm> but yhc is cross platform
08:51:56 <dcoutts> because ndm is going to write us a hIDE plugin for yhc, right? :-)
08:52:03 <beelsebob_> igloo: indeed... I'm doing an OS X UI for it
08:52:10 <basti_> ghc is proven, isnt it?
08:52:17 <Igloo> Aarg
08:52:19 <ndm> dcoutts, you're more likely to get Windows code than yhc code out of me
08:52:26 <dcoutts> ndm, :-)
08:52:30 <Igloo> Is XFoo standard for OS X apps?
08:52:40 <ndm> Igloo, only when beelsebob_ is doing them
08:52:44 <ndm> (i.e. XHoogle)
08:52:45 <beelsebob_> basti: ghc is slow at compiling, and doesn't support tracing out of the box
08:52:49 <beelsebob_> igloo: all pro apps
08:52:50 <dcoutts> Igloo, yeah, XX for their X11 server
08:52:58 <beelsebob_> lol
08:53:04 <manulito_> i just finished a ~50 pages introduction to haskell, now im looking for a good tutorial to continue with, any suggestions?
08:53:07 <basti_> beelsebob_: i was wondering if compiling haskelldb for 8:40 minutes would be alright
08:53:10 * dcoutts tries to think of an XXX program
08:53:11 <ndm> basti: and ghc does not generate cross platform binaries
08:53:21 * Igloo assumes XFoo is an X11 Foo, just like WinFoo is an MS Windows foo, so this is likely to cause confusion  :-(
08:53:25 <manulito_> i guess topic-ones are okeuy?
08:53:33 <basti_> ndm, beelsebob_: I'm talking about my process here
08:53:37 <dcoutts> Igloo, no, that's GFoo!
08:53:52 <Igloo> Yes dear  :-)
08:53:55 <beelsebob_> basti: I'm missing something here...
08:53:57 <dcoutts> or KFoo
08:54:13 <beelsebob_> iFoo if it's OS X but a consumer app
08:54:31 <beelsebob_> fo<insert pun here>o if you're witty enough
08:54:42 <Igloo> ndm: "cross platform binaries" as in cross-compiling, compiling to portable C or compiling to bytecode with standalone interpreter?
08:54:56 <ndm> compiling to bytecode with standalone interpetter
08:55:34 <Igloo> Oh, interesting. With a #! line on Unix?
08:55:55 <Lemmih> dcoutts: I can't test it without gtk2hs /-:
08:55:55 <Igloo> How do you run them on Windows? Associate .yhc with yhc-runtime.exe or something?
08:55:58 <ndm> Igloo, file format not yet fixed - but seems a reasonable idea
08:56:05 <ndm> yeah, and windows would be an association
08:56:27 <ndm> but i'm also pushing for binary cat'ing, so cat runtime bytecode produces a platform specific binary
08:56:35 <ndm> that will also run cross platform with the interpretter
08:57:00 <ndm> so windows users (say) get a standalone binary, but for everyone else its crossplatform
08:57:07 <Igloo> How will the interpreter know where to start interpreting?
08:58:22 <dcoutts> Lemmih, and you're still having problems installing Gtk2Hs?
08:58:30 <Igloo> Or have I misunderstood what you mean?
08:59:19 <ndm> Igloo, a reverse count
08:59:30 <ndm> i.e. end of file, last 4 bytes says the length of the file
08:59:40 <Igloo> Ah, cunning
08:59:49 <ndm> Igloo, zip does a similar trick
08:59:56 <ndm> (but not particularly well)
09:00:03 <Igloo> How so?
09:00:17 <ndm> it has signature bytes
09:00:29 <ndm> PK\00\05, from what i remember
09:00:29 <Igloo> Ah, right
09:00:51 <ndm> and the reader scans back from the end of the file for those bytes, then reads from there forward for page table etc
09:01:00 * Igloo wonders how long it'll be until someone has a 2G binary  :-)
09:01:21 <Igloo> Well, 4G
09:01:22 * ndm hopes it will be a long time
09:01:33 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Yeah.
09:02:24 <Igloo> Hmm, you only need to embed a massive static datastructure actually (like a huge binary file as a string)
09:02:29 * Igloo would go for 8 bytes  :-)
09:03:07 <ndm> still once you hit 2G, how do you distribute this monster app
09:03:30 <Igloo> Slowly  :-)
09:03:40 <ndm> but yes, 8 bytes is a better idea, just to be safe
09:06:25 <Khisanth> ndm: on DVD of course :)
09:06:43 <ndm> Khisanth, my DVD drive is toast, sadly
09:07:13 <Khisanth> flash drive? mini HD?
09:07:29 <ndm> my usb port is also fried :)
09:07:38 <Igloo> ndm: Do you expect yhc n to be able to interpret programs compiled with yhc (n+1) and vice versa?
09:07:40 <Khisanth> oO
09:07:53 <Khisanth> you sound abusive!
09:08:09 <ndm> Igloo, no idea - its hard to say without knowing how the versions will change
09:08:21 <ndm> i would guess n+1 will run n
09:08:37 <ndm> but the bytecode is well thought out, it should survive intact for a long time
09:09:02 <Igloo> *nod*
09:09:06 <Igloo> Looking forward to it  :-)
09:09:33 <ndm> I'll try and collect a list of ideas for the bytecode format, things like #! at the start etc.
09:09:42 <ndm> so once it gets public, it can become frozen for a long time
09:10:38 <Lemmih> Hi Igloo.
09:10:46 <Igloo> Hi
09:10:51 <dcoutts> Igloo, can you help Lemmih and me a sec with this debian automake problem
09:11:27 <Igloo> ...
09:11:29 <dcoutts> I'm trying to remember what the problem is exactly and what I should advise the poor debian users
09:11:46 <dcoutts> so we do autoreconf and it uses the wrong version of automake
09:11:59 <dcoutts> even thoguh the Makefile.am specifies a minimum version of automake
09:12:18 <dcoutts> it uses like version 1.4 or something ainchent
09:12:41 <dcoutts> is it just a matter of installing a later version?
09:13:10 <CosmicRay> are we talking a haskell bytecode format?
09:13:14 <Igloo> Installing and running, I think
09:13:33 <Igloo> Oh, the wiki was down when I wanted to read a page about it, I think
09:13:48 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Yes, although not in any details or anything
09:13:59 <CosmicRay> sounds nice.
09:14:05 <CosmicRay> does an interpreter exist?
09:15:04 <dcoutts> Lemmih, you can try installing automake-1.9
09:15:49 <gour> dcoutts: have you tried to invoke manually aclocal, automake, autoconf & configure ?
09:15:50 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Yep.
09:16:28 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok then try autoreconf again
09:16:49 <dcoutts> I'd like to see if that works before doing the manual thing gour suggests
09:17:08 <Lemmih> autoreconf: automake-1.9 failed with exit status: 63
09:17:18 <dcoutts> any messages?
09:17:25 <gour> well, it's not hard to write a 3-line script :-)
09:17:33 <gour> to invoke them
09:17:39 <dcoutts> gour, true
09:17:59 <gour> autoreconf is buggy and confirmed from its devs
09:18:05 <dcoutts> gour, actualyl the autogen/sh scripts I've seen that some projects use are non-trivial
09:18:27 <gour> well, for one project i invoke from the script:
09:18:40 <gour> aclocal  --verbose -I m4
09:18:47 <gour> automake -a -v -c
09:18:56 <gour> autoconf -v
09:19:15 <gour> ./configure
09:19:17 <gour> make
09:19:21 <gour> that's all
09:19:29 <gour> with autoreconf it fails
09:20:07 <gour> actually more than 3-lines script :-)
09:21:27 <Igloo> Hmm, the log searcher is impressively slow
09:24:10 <Lemmih> Hurray. Got it configured.
09:24:24 <gour> what did you do?
09:25:05 <dcoutts> Lemmih, for a faster build you can do ./configure --with-hcflags=-O0 to override the default -O
09:25:31 <Lemmih> gour: Figured out that aclocal is part of the automake-1.9 package. (:
09:25:54 <gour> :-)
09:26:10 <psi> is some part of hIDE already up and running?
09:26:22 <schyffe> How do you split a string by a char? Like I want to split "abc def ghi" with ' ' (space) and want a result like ["abc", "def", "ghi"].. Is there any standard function that does it?
09:26:37 <Lemmih> @eval words "hello world"
09:26:43 <lambdabot> ["hello","world"]
09:26:51 <schyffe> I actually want to be able to define the separator
09:26:54 <psi> schyffe: not a general one, I think
09:26:54 * Igloo can't see any rationale for 1.4 having a higher priority than the others
09:26:58 <schyffe> it will be a new line character
09:27:05 <Lemmih> schyffe: There's one in fps.
09:27:07 <Igloo> Anyway, using the versioned command names looks like the easiest way to go
09:27:18 <schyffe> is there any one like words which works for a '\n'?
09:27:27 <psi> lines
09:27:29 <Lemmih> @lines "hello\nworld"
09:27:30 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
09:27:32 <schyffe> ah thanks
09:27:33 <Lemmih> @eval lines "hello\nworld"
09:27:35 <lambdabot> ["hello","world"]
09:29:52 <dcoutts> psi, yeah a bit is working so far
09:30:10 <dcoutts> psi, the implementation is about 24 hours old :-)
09:30:16 <dcoutts> @where hIDE
09:30:17 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
09:30:54 <psi> cool :)
09:31:14 <gour> but it is counting :-)
09:32:06 <gour> 24 hours and well' get a gui (mock)
09:32:26 <gour> who is saying that haskell programming is not productive?
09:32:33 <basti_> nobody
09:32:36 <schyffe> so is there any haskell function which checks if every element in an array have the same length? it feels like it's already a function defined for everything
09:32:46 <schyffe> every element in a list*
09:32:46 * gour lol
09:32:54 <basti_> schyffe: map ((==n).length) maybe?
09:33:30 <basti_> or, foldr1 (&&).(==) (map length listoflists) or something
09:33:56 <schyffe> ah thanks
09:33:59 <manulito_> im reading a code example in haskell, and it contains _ at a place, where can i read more about this, or what does it mean?
09:34:18 <ProfTeggy> schyffe, Apply (nub . map length) and check it's a singleton
09:34:31 <vegai> manulito_: in a guard?
09:34:32 <basti_> or that.
09:34:35 <basti_> ;)
09:34:37 <vegai> or a pattern, that is
09:35:00 <manulito_> vegai: no, in a function defenition as an inparameter
09:35:16 <vegai> it often means to ignore that parameter
09:35:32 <manulito_> ok
09:35:34 <manulito_> thanks
09:36:28 <Philippa_> _ matches anything and doesn't bind - so yeah, on it's own it's "ignore". Somebody /could/ write foo@_, but that's just plain masochistic
09:37:00 <araujo> hah

09:58:47 * Korollary is looking at the hIDE wiki page and wondering how really swears by the MS Visual Studio...
09:58:55 <Korollary> +someone
09:59:25 <psi> hm. I can't configure latest hs-plugins. 'runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/usr/local' exits with 'runhaskell: waitForProcess: interrupted (Interrupted system call)'
10:00:22 <psi> before that it does manage to find ghc
10:00:41 <gour> Korollary: any suggestion?
10:00:52 <psi> I should say I'm using mac os x
10:00:57 <rafl_> CosmicRay: Hello!
10:01:30 <Korollary> gour: This is the goliath of IDE's, imho: http://slickedit.com/
10:04:11 <dcoutts> Korollary, well a lot of people use MS VS
10:04:39 <Korollary> dcoutts: I used to be one of them.
10:05:02 <gour> Korollary: well $500 for a tool to write free apps :-o
10:05:14 <gour> Korollary: and no haskell support...
10:05:29 <Korollary> gour: Uh, I was not trying to market it to you heh.
10:05:39 <gour> Korollary: well, i'd rather support hs (aka hIDE :-) development
10:05:59 <dcoutts> Korollary, feel free to add slickedit to the list of IDEs to look at when thinking about features & UI etc
10:06:01 <dcoutts> @where hIDE
10:06:02 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
10:06:04 <gour> Korrolary: did not understand it as such
10:06:16 <dcoutts> Korollary, there's a list on the wiki
10:06:24 <gour> Korollary: :-)
10:07:49 <musasabi> Haskell support for Visual Studio is in the works I think.
10:09:34 <dcoutts> musasabi, all the more reason to contribute to hIDE :-)
10:10:40 <gour> musababi: what about Linux?
10:11:40 <musasabi> dcoutts: personally I like to design things with pen and paper (the fastest way) and then using emacs + ghci + vi emulation to code. It keeps me quite happy.
10:12:59 <dcoutts> musasabi, sure, but an IDE is useful for more than just initial writing, it's for makeing it easeir to browse code and use tools etc
10:14:34 <psi> I think TextMate (http://macromates.com/) for OS X has some cool features. "text triggers", "smart typing", etc. something to be inspired by, perhaps.
10:15:38 <musasabi> dcoutts: then just grep in eshell (of course that is of little help for fancy things).
10:16:18 <musasabi> Of course an IDE can be better, but currently there are not enough things keeping me unhappy with the current setup.
10:17:14 <gour> musababi: but be generous to other users
10:17:21 <dcoutts> yes, which is why we've not demanded an IDE before
10:17:34 <Akshaal> Which stages of planning will hIDE pass and is there any documentation or proposal for the inner structure of hIDE?
10:17:48 <gour> we want Haskell to spread like a forest fire
10:17:59 <dcoutts> Akshaal, we're trying to document the internal structure on the wiki
10:18:08 <dcoutts> Akshaal, feel free to contribute your ideas
10:18:09 <gour> @where hIDE
10:18:10 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
10:18:19 <gour> huh, i got it :-)
10:18:27 * Akshaal cannot contribute becouse of worse english
10:18:56 <gour> Akshael: just go ahead, it's wiki
10:18:57 <dcoutts> Akshaal, well you can contribute your ideas here and I can translate :-)
10:19:03 <musasabi> I think it is important to use Haskell for non-haskell related apps.
10:19:09 <dcoutts> here or in the wiki
10:19:22 <gour> musababi: what do you think?
10:19:29 <musasabi> Because that is one way of getting more people interested in the language and prove it outside the sandbox.
10:19:37 <gour> musababi: like darcs?
10:19:40 <musasabi> yes.
10:19:55 <gour> musababi: i have one app in mind
10:20:09 <gour> musababi: but let me 1st learn enough haskell
10:20:17 <musasabi> gour: what kind of thing?
10:20:25 <gour> musababi: and help gtk2hs & hIDE
10:20:43 * Korollary is thinking of a haskell app that deletes C++ code. That oughtta help many people.
10:20:44 <gour> musababi: general application
10:21:16 <gour> musababi: not a dev-tool, but for end-users
10:21:40 <musasabi> sounds good.
10:21:45 <dcoutts> musasabi, you're right of course, darcs and pugs have both brought many new coders to Haskell
10:21:57 <gour> musababi: the one which is usually written today in C++
10:22:14 <dcoutts> however I think there is still a gap in the market for good Haskell dev tools
10:22:29 <gour> musababi: but i plan to use some C-lib via ffi
10:22:40 <dcoutts> in particular something that ties together the many existing excelent tools and make the whole thing easy to use
10:22:45 <dcoutts> for experts and beginners
10:22:58 <gour> dcoutts: i agree, the haskell dev platform has to become a viable alternative
10:23:17 <Igloo> They might stop people being turned away, but they won't attract new people, though
10:23:18 <gour> hIDE is a most appealing one - all in haskell
10:23:40 <Akshaal> as for now, I don't see _internal_ structure of hIDE, like component levels, core, API between them ... someone should start initial version of such proposal. as for now, there is features requests in wiki
10:24:20 <SamB> I rather suspect pugs has done a better job of that than darcs has...
10:24:39 * SamB shudders just thinking about darcs internals
10:25:01 <dcoutts> Akshaal, yes we need to add more internal design stuff
10:25:03 <Igloo> SamB: Send patches to improve them then  :-)
10:25:17 <gour> SamB: i cannot judge internals, but darcs is the 1st vcs i use regularly
10:25:30 <gour> SamB: i never wrapped my head against cvs
10:25:48 <dcoutts> Akshaal, do you have any ideas, or you want to see what is already planned?
10:25:50 <SamB> um, shouldn't somebody who is not afraid of darcs and who does understand it work on that?
10:26:38 <SamB> s/afraid of darcs/afraid of the darcs internals/, s/it/them/
10:26:46 <gour> SamB: afaik, Ian is working on some important issues
10:26:51 <dcoutts> Akshaal, perhaps we should start internal docs on a different page
10:27:21 <Akshaal> dcoutts: certainly
10:27:22 <Igloo> Ah, fear is good. Not understanding might be disadvantageous.
10:33:09 <Akshaal> cabal 1.1.3
10:33:10 <Akshaal> ./Setup.lhs install
10:33:11 <Akshaal> ./Distribution/Simple.hs:61:1: lexical error
10:33:20 <basti_> Lemmih: are you there?
10:34:15 <Akshaal> oh, make install..
10:39:46 <Akshaal> when package.buildinfo has more than one Executable section, cabal sees only first executable at all
10:40:05 <Akshaal> what could be wrong?
10:45:18 <creichen> Hi! I have a brief question regarding http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/RankTwoPolymorphism:
10:46:28 <creichen> According to that page, Hindley-Milner + rank-2 polymorphism = System F. My understanding used to be that System F allows universal quantifiers to be nested arbitrarily deeply, but I can't seem to find the proper literature ATM. Does anyone know off the top of his/her head which interpretation is right?
10:47:41 <creichen> (In particular, type checking is supposedly undecidable for System F, so it would be undecidable in ghc now if the page was correct... or am I missing something?)
10:56:28 <basti_>       it is a member of package base-1.0, which is hidden
10:56:45 <basti_>     rts-1.0, (ghc-6.5), base-1.0, haskell98-1.0, template-haskell-1.0,
10:56:48 <basti_> though
10:59:20 <basti_> ...?
10:59:49 <Lemmih> basti_: I am now.
11:00:32 <basti_> Lemmih: there were lots of errors with ghc-6.4, so i tried 6.5
11:00:36 <basti_> you can see the results above
11:00:46 <Trinity> whats the purpose of (x:xs) what does it do ?
11:01:00 <Lemmih> Trinity: (:) is cons.
11:01:06 <Lemmih> @eval 1:[2,3]
11:01:14 <lambdabot> [1,2,3]
11:01:22 <basti_> @eval 1:[]
11:01:23 <lambdabot> [1]
11:01:29 <kosmikus> creichen: in System F quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily, that is correct
11:01:36 <Lemmih> @eval let f (x:xs) = x in f [1,2,3]
11:01:36 <basti_> @eval 1:2:3:[]
11:01:38 <lambdabot> 1
11:01:40 <lambdabot> [1,2,3]
11:01:52 <basti_> that was confusing, now
11:01:58 <basti_> ;)
11:01:58 <kosmikus> creichen: furthermore, type checking in System F is decidable
11:02:13 <kosmikus> creichen: you probably mean type inference
11:02:16 <Trinity> humm but why write like this  functionname [] (x:xs) =   instead of  functionname [] a =
11:02:18 <basti_> Lemmih: basically i get an error that a package is hidden which isn't
11:02:42 <basti_> Trinity: this declaration would match calls with an empty list and a nonempty list
11:02:56 <basti_> instead of calls with an empty list and an arbitary value
11:03:19 <Lemmih> basti_: Got 6.4.1?
11:03:22 <Trinity> ok
11:03:58 <psi> Trinity: and if your function needs the head and the tail of the list, it's very handy
11:04:05 <basti_> Lemmih: no, but i'll have a look what is in debian
11:04:47 <Lemmih> basti_: You couldn't install haskelldb?
11:05:12 <basti_> i tried that, but it wouldnt give me that tool
11:05:22 <basti_> directdb
11:05:40 <Lemmih> directdb?
11:05:56 <basti_> thats a part of haskelldb.
11:06:06 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Yay. hide-shell is neat! (:
11:06:10 <basti_> i needed it to run the examples.
11:06:14 <basti_> i don't know what its for
11:06:23 * Akshaal fights with cabal
11:06:39 <Lemmih> Akshaal: runhaskell -i Setup.lhs {configure|build|install}
11:07:33 <Akshaal> Lemmih: when package.buildinfo has more than one executable field, cabal forgots about other executables
11:08:29 <Akshaal> like ...; executable x1; buildable True;; executable x2; buildable True;;...
11:09:26 <Akshaal> cabal build only x1. if me removes info about x2 from package.buildinfo, then all builds fine
11:10:55 <Lemmih> Akshaal: Why not place the buildinfo in the cabal file?
11:11:59 <Akshaal> becouse it produced by configure.ac
11:15:06 <cbus> if i have a string with an integer how do i translate the int value in it?
11:15:10 <cbus> i dont remember the syntax of read
11:15:39 <Akshaal> Prelude> (read "3") :: Int
11:15:40 <Akshaal> 3
11:15:47 <cbus> i just tried it ;)
11:15:51 <cbus> Hugs.Base> read "123" :: Integer
11:15:58 <cbus> been so long since i used it
11:17:19 <schyffe> what is a singleton?
11:17:24 <SamB> hmm, this is NOT good... my Z-Machine iterpreter crashes with a library error when trying to run Museum...
11:17:44 <SamB> ... and when I try to run Cloak of Darkness, I start out in Darkness
11:17:52 <Lemmih> Akshaal: Hm, it really should work. Try parsing the file with Distribution.PackageDescription.readHookedBuildInfo
11:18:50 <SamB> when I'm supposed to start out in "Foyer of the Opera House"
11:19:02 <schyffe> how do I check if all the values in a integer array is the same? like [5,5,5,5,5] should give True
11:20:08 <integral> (length $ group list) == 1 ?
11:20:43 <basti_> Lemmih: in case you wonder, no i can't install haskelldb, the dependencies are fubar
11:20:53 <schyffe> what is group?
11:20:56 <schyffe> it says it can't find it
11:20:58 <Lemmih> basti_: How so?
11:21:02 <integral> oh, it's from Data.List
11:21:11 <schyffe> ah okay
11:21:43 <basti_> Lemmih: i got ghc-6.4.4 installed. haskelldb wants ghc-6.2.something
11:22:14 <schyffe> what does '$' do?
11:22:23 <Lemmih> basti_: The haskelldb I cabalized should work for GHC 6.4.x
11:22:29 <basti_> schyffe: a $ b c === a (b c)
11:22:52 <basti_> Lemmih: i can't build it because of lots of errors, or under GHC 6.5 the problem i mentioned before
11:23:00 <basti_> /tmp/ghc27696.s:26: Error: unassigned file number 1
11:23:05 <schyffe> ah I see
11:23:07 <basti_> errors like this one, after loooong time
11:23:31 <Akshaal> Lemmih: looks like readHookedBuildInfo works
11:23:53 <Akshaal> prolly problem in unionBuildInfo
11:24:02 <basti_> under ghc-6.5 something about base-1.0 being hidden (wtf? its not)
11:24:03 <Akshaal> how to read cabal buildinfo?
11:24:22 <eieiei> y'all are all programing language geeks, right?
11:24:39 <basti_> some are. others are not.
11:24:55 <eieiei> I'm trying to write something in, ugh, VBA.
11:25:01 <basti_> hmm
11:25:02 <eieiei> I need to know if it supports higher-order functions.
11:25:24 <ndm> eieiei, not really, but you can fake them
11:25:45 <eieiei> how so? :~
11:25:47 <ndm> you can create a class, give two different classes the same name
11:25:55 <eieiei> oh.
11:25:56 <ndm> then pass them around as Object, so loosely typed
11:26:15 <ndm> different names for the classes, same name for the methods in them
11:26:24 <creichen> kosmikus: Thanks, but I was referring to type checking, cf. http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html
11:26:25 <ndm> then you can call in
11:26:34 <eieiei> damn, too hacky. I wish there were Haskell or Scheme interfaces for Excel.
11:26:42 <ndm> VB5 introduced teh implements keyword, which is like virtual
11:26:50 <ndm> its a more pure, static typed and faster
11:26:59 <creichen> kosmikus: So, basically, the ghc type system now covers all of System F (since it IIRC has support for arbitrary rank-k polymorphism)?
11:27:01 <ndm> and will run in Excel 97 and above
11:27:04 <Lemmih> basti_: Did you use the Cabal build system?
11:27:14 <basti_> Lemmih: you mean: ./Setup build?
11:27:23 <ndm> search for implements if that solution is too hacky
11:27:32 <eieiei> I need to write genetic algorithms code that will run from Excel spreadsheets.
11:27:38 <eieiei> ndm: thanks for the pointers!
11:27:47 <Lemmih> basti_: GHC 6.5 will hide the base package if it isn't specified in the build-depends for the library.
11:27:54 <eieiei> How are .xla add-ins made, anyway?
11:27:56 <basti_> :-o
11:27:56 <Lemmih> basti_: Yes.
11:28:05 <ndm> they are COM dlls then renamed
11:28:05 <basti_> okay that might explain that
11:28:16 <ndm> not sure exactly, but there is probably some interface they must implement
11:28:53 <eieiei> ndm: Hmm. I don't understand COM well. It's, like, a cross-application object model, right?
11:29:11 <ndm> eieiei, kind of - i don't really understand it at all
11:29:23 <ndm> if you use VB it provides COM stuff for you automatically
11:29:28 <eieiei> I'm trying to think how I can pick up a .dll/.so/.dylib output by mzscheme and make it into an excel add-in.
11:29:39 <ndm> not easily!
11:29:51 <ndm> can you do a dll that can be called by C?
11:29:53 <eieiei> writing applications for the financial sector means excel.
11:30:01 <eieiei> yes, you can do a dll that can be called by C.
11:30:15 <ndm> then use "declare" to interface to it from VB
11:30:22 <eieiei> hmmm.
11:30:36 <ndm> declare allows you to give a C function you can call in an arbitrary dll
11:31:03 <eieiei> I don't understand.. declare allows you to write in C?
11:37:42 <eieiei> hmm. a search for "Visual Basic LISP" leads to this .PPT: http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/disruptive.ppt
11:37:57 <eieiei> oh well, html version by google: http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:NrNLCkq81nkJ:research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/disruptive.ppt+visual+basic+for+lisp+programmers&hl=pt-BR&client=safari
11:38:57 <Akshaal> updatePackageDescription in cabal is certainly broken
11:40:15 <ndm> eieiei, if you write a C dll, or a dll that C can call, with a function "foo" in it
11:40:37 <ndm> declare foo from "mydll.dll" (byval x as long) as long
11:40:44 <ndm> then you can call foo(1) from VB
11:41:05 <ndm> i can't quite remember the syntax of declare, but its something similar (by from is the wrong word)
11:43:52 <eieiei> thanks!
11:43:52 <eieiei> that is really really great.
11:43:52 <eieiei> thank you very much :)
11:43:52 <schyffe> Is there any function which compares if two lists have the same elements (not necessarily in the same order)
11:43:52 <basti_> schyffe: are the elements comparable?
11:43:52 <schyffe> yeah, they are Char's
11:43:52 <basti_> then you could sort and check element by element
11:43:52 <eieiei> From a Microsoft internal presentation: "What?s the difference between a C programmer and a LISP programmer?"
11:43:52 <kosmikus> creichen: sorry, I was confused/imprecise; the paper is about Curry-style system F; ghc internally is using Church-style, where checking is decidable
11:48:18 <eieiei> "A LISP programmer knows the value of everything and the cost of nothing. A C programmer knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing."
11:48:18 <kosmikus> creichen: more on the other topic: rank-2 polymorphism is already enough to have datatypes with polymorphic fields (constructor functions for such datatypes have rank-2-polymorphic types); using packing with datatypes, rank-2-polymorphism is thus enough to encode rank-n polymorphism
11:48:18 <kosmikus> creichen: however, System F is impredicative, whereas ghc currently is still predicative; i.e., quantified variables cannot in general be instantiated to polymorphic types in ghc -- there's ongoing work to lift this restriction, too
11:50:05 <sieni> hop
11:50:16 <SamB> is it possible to link in .o files interactively in GHCi?
11:50:43 <basti_> interactively?
11:50:52 <basti_> you mean .so files?
11:50:59 <SamB> it doesn't like when I try :set Curses/YiUtils.o...
11:51:19 <basti_> uhm no.
11:51:20 <sieni> eieiei: very funny, although the c programmer part wasn't the original one
11:51:27 <SamB> why not?
11:51:42 <basti_> because .o files are not made for being loaded dynamically?
11:51:42 <eieiei> ndm: it works!
11:51:45 <basti_> .so files are
11:51:50 <eieiei> ndm: man, you've just made me a  lot of money.
11:51:52 <SamB> it can load them at the beginning!
11:51:57 <basti_> yes.
11:51:59 <basti_> but not later.
11:52:05 <SamB> it is pathetic!
11:52:08 <basti_> no
11:52:11 <basti_> C can't do that too.
11:52:42 <sieni> eieiei: wasn't it originally an Oscar Wilde quote?
11:53:01 <SamB> why would C be able to load .o files?
11:53:09 <basti_> is is not.
11:53:13 <basti_> thats what i'm saying
11:53:21 <SamB> well, GHCi can and does!
11:53:31 <SickJacken> do you guys reckon the structure (Map String (Map Int (Set String))) is easily replaced by mutable arrays ?
11:53:32 <basti_> it does?
11:53:38 <SickJacken> or is that going to be tedious and a lot of work
11:54:01 <SamB> when I run it like this:
11:54:07 <SamB> % ghci Curses/YiUtils.o
11:54:16 <SamB> it says many things, including:
11:54:22 <SamB> Loading object (static) Curses/YiUtils.o ... done
11:54:22 <SamB> final link ... done
11:54:42 <basti_> okay.
11:54:57 <SamB> I suppose that "final link" message does sound a bit final...
11:55:01 <basti_> yes.
11:55:06 <basti_> you want hs-plugins.
11:55:09 <basti_> or .so files.
11:55:10 <basti_> or both.
11:55:38 <SamB> nevermind, its not like I'm going to need to rebuild that alot or anything...

11:57:02 <creichen> kosmikus: Thank you very much for your help-- the keywords you provided were very useful (and I have some more reading to do now ;-)
11:58:13 <SickJacken> do you guys reckon the structure (Map String (Map Int (Set String))) is easily replaced by mutable arrays ?
11:58:19 * Akshaal sent patch for cabal to Isaac Jones
11:58:30 <kosmikus> creichen: you're welcome
12:02:56 <Akshaal> hrrrr: 2005-09-14 22:46:14 ijones@syntaxpolice.org T=remote_smtp defer (111): Connection refused
12:04:55 <schyffe> How do I get the unique elements of a list? like "abbcccd" should return "abcd"?
12:05:09 <xerox> @type List.nub
12:05:15 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]
12:05:48 <gour> schyffe: there in one (useful) exercise in craft-2e in regards :-)
12:05:53 <schyffe> ah thank you.. I have no idea what to search for in the huge library of functions
12:06:07 <gour> schyffe: i spent some time with it
12:06:07 <xerox> schyffe: try this
12:06:13 <xerox> @doc Data.List
12:06:14 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data.List.html
12:06:26 <xerox> There is this kind of extensive doc for everything in the stdlib.
12:06:43 <gour> dcoutts: you gui shell looks cute (i just built it)
12:06:48 <schyffe> from that page, how do I know 'nub' is the functions I want?
12:07:24 <schyffe> the name itself doesn't tell me anything
12:08:20 <xerox> Search the page for "remove duplicate"
12:08:22 <xerox> or something?
12:08:41 <xerox> There aren't that many function, and there is an index, too.
12:09:03 <SickJacken> do you guys reckon the structure (Map String (Map Int (Set String))) is easily replaced by mutable arrays ?
12:09:55 <schyffe> allrighty
12:10:18 <musasabi> SickJacken: depends on things. Is the Map Int (Set String) dense?
12:10:19 <SamB> SickJacken: probably depends on what you are using it for
12:10:53 <SamB> probably you'd want to keep the outer Map
12:11:19 <SamB> because strings don't make good array indices
12:14:18 <SickJacken> that map contains about 2000 elements
12:14:57 <SickJacken> the set has got on average 30 elements
12:16:07 <musasabi> SickJacken: but are the Ints in the Map continuous (or just with a few holes) ?
12:17:09 <Trinity> | (x/=y) = (matchPattern++y) match k (x:xs) (ys) whats wrong with this ?
12:17:12 <SickJacken> ow lots of holes, but im thinking of using a hashtable to have those ints point to array indices
12:17:14 <SickJacken> so i dont have holes
12:17:29 <SickJacken> for every inner map in the outer map, the ints are the same
12:17:36 <SickJacken> so i can use that hashtable for the complete structure
12:17:46 <musasabi> SickJacken: How large is max (indexes) - min (indexes) ?
12:18:20 <kosmikus> Trinity: what's the error you get?
12:18:31 <dcoutts> Lemmih, gour: glade you like the hIDE UI mockup :-)
12:18:36 <musasabi> if it is < 5000 it might still make sense to go with an array. Also for the inner type trying whether list or set is faster might make sense.
12:19:10 <SickJacken> well the difference between the smallest int and largest int in the inner map is surely smaller than 5000
12:19:13 <gour> dcoutts: please bind Quit ;)
12:19:37 <kosmikus> hi MarcWebe1, didn't know that you're on #haskell, too
12:19:47 <SickJacken> but allocating so much empty stuff is surely not sensible is it??? because that array will exist for EVERY outer map element
12:20:11 <dcoutts> gour, heh, the window manager quit works! isn't that enough :-)
12:20:28 <musasabi> SickJacken: so the arrays are of variable sizes too?
12:20:37 <MarcWebe1> kosmikus: Only from time to time
12:20:55 <kosmikus> MarcWebe1: learning Haskell?
12:21:00 <gour> dcoutts: well think about hig :-)
12:21:14 <MarcWebe1> kosmikus: I think you can answer this question by yourself ;)
12:21:38 <kosmikus> well, maybe you just like the channel :)
12:21:39 * musasabi would try Map String (STArray s Int Foo) where Foo is either (Set String) or [String].
12:21:47 <MarcWebe1> I can't write pascal any more.. I don't have enough time.. And I don't want to learn many different C++ libs.. So I thought it could be worth learning haskell :)
12:22:12 <kosmikus> heh -- but it's not for a course in kn, is it?
12:22:13 <dcoutts> gour, yes we'll want to follow the HIG
12:22:16 <gour> MarcWebe1: same here
12:22:25 <gour> dcoutts: heh
12:22:49 <gour> dcoutts: i have enough for today
12:22:52 <MarcWebe1> kosmikus: I don't know.. :)
12:23:05 <gour> dcoutts: it was/is a big day for hIDE
12:23:11 <dcoutts> gour, :-)
12:23:12 <kosmikus> MarcWebe1: you don't know?
12:23:23 <SickJacken> musasabi, no they are not, they rely on an input parameter of the program
12:23:29 <SickJacken> so its static but a parameter
12:23:33 <MarcWebe1> I don't know wether there are any courses .. I don't attend one
12:23:50 <MarcWebe1> kosmikus: I'm trying to create an ebuild for jhc. fetching and copying/compiling does work.
12:24:03 <gour> dcoutts: i wrote you in the morning - it's an auspicious day ;)
12:24:16 <MarcWebe1> The first time you compile something, jhc will automatically create an optimized version of the standard libraries in 'ho' files next to their source code. This is why the library needs to be somewhere writable.
12:24:24 <SickJacken> isnt STArray different from MArray?
12:24:54 <MarcWebe1> This part makes me having some headache. It would be best to build the whole library before installing..
12:25:20 <kosmikus> MarcWebe1: sounds like this is the right thing to do
12:25:29 <manulito_> if i got two lists that i wanna compare in a special way, item for item, what is the best way to get one item from each list and handle them. i wanna do like a generator that d<-list1 b<-list2, is that possible, or should i use take/takewhile something?
12:25:32 <kosmikus> better to discuss this on #gentoo-haskell though
12:25:44 <MarcWebe1> There is #gentoo-haskell?
12:25:44 <manulito_> what should i read about =)
12:27:25 <Trinity> how do i make something like a to char ??  like  variable a i want it to be a char ?
12:28:05 <Akshaal> x = 'a'
12:29:40 <Trinity> hmm but can i make an empty list which takes char.. i mean declare it in advance ?
12:30:41 <Akshaal> x = [] :: [Char]

12:55:46 <musasabi> MarcWebe1: I am thinking of writing proper library support for jhc (with Cabal hooks) in the near future if john does not move into that direction.
12:55:46 <MarcWebe1> musasabi: I'm just a haskell newbe. I don't know what Cabal hooks mean... :(
12:55:50 <musasabi> MarcWebe1: it would mean that installing libraries for jhc would work in a nice and proper way.
12:58:23 * musasabi looks at jhc building
12:58:23 <MarcWebe1> musasabi: Do you think it's a big effort to make an ebuild compile every library?
12:58:23 <Itkovian> dcoutts: pretty neat shots in the HWN
12:58:24 <musasabi> MarcWebe1: currently it makes little sense to add library ebuilds for jhc.
12:58:31 <musasabi> in the future it should be very easy.
12:58:51 <Itkovian> dcoutts: just curious though ... what do the 0, 1 and 2 mean in the grammar on http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/gallery/Cairo-demo/Cairo_demo_13
12:59:20 <dcoutts> the 0,1 and 2?
12:59:42 <dcoutts> Itkovian, not sure what you're referring to
12:59:59 <Itkovian> F,0,"..." ; F,1," ..." etc
13:00:04 <dcoutts> Itkovian, anyway, it's xerox's great software! I just did the release! :-)
13:00:14 <dcoutts> oh, right
13:00:15 <Itkovian> ah, ok, I'll go and bug him then
13:00:19 <dcoutts> those are the rules
13:00:23 <dcoutts> the gramemr rules
13:00:29 <dcoutts> not sure what the number is for
13:00:58 <dcoutts> I actually want to bug xerox too, since I want to use this software for a demo on Friday
13:01:05 <dcoutts> xerox, ping!
13:02:10 <MarcWebe1> musasabi: The problem is when copying libs to /libs/jhclibs with read and write for everyone how to tell jhc to also create the precompiled lib files with read and write for everyone ?
13:12:28 <musasabi> MarcWebe1: having anyone write would create security holes.
13:12:51 <musasabi> MarcWebe1: they need to be compiled inside the chroot and then copied over.
13:13:11 <MarcWebe1> So you need on haskell program to compile which uses anything of the lib
13:15:53 <Trinity> (x/=y) = matchPattern++[y] match k (x:xs) (ys))  (im trying to save the y value in a recursive loop how do i do that ?)
13:21:07 <Cale> Trinity: hm?
13:21:26 <Cale> You're defining (x /= y)...
13:21:30 <Cale> for what type?
13:21:45 <Trinity> well everytime i do this i get an value of y over that i want to save..
13:21:59 <Trinity> y = char
13:22:14 <cbus> haha
13:22:19 <cbus> detta r fr ltt
13:22:23 <cbus> mmm *lska haskell*
13:22:57 <Trinity> ?? fr ltt hur gr man d ?
13:23:19 <cbus> oops wrong chan was to #haskell.se
13:23:23 <cbus> i know how i should solve my shit ;)
13:23:24 <cbus> not yours
13:23:31 <Trinity> ok :)
13:23:40 <cbus> focused on mine :)
13:23:41 <musasabi> What is the definition of a package name in Cabal?
13:24:42 <cbus> is it nice to use$ alot instead of ( ) ? ;)
13:25:07 <musasabi> When it makes code more readable. They are not isomorphic however.
13:25:32 <cbus> putStrLn.show$ sortedFile
13:25:35 <cbus> putStrLn.show$ checkWeight sortedFile 1 2
13:25:38 <cbus> like that? ;)
13:34:06 <cbus> hmm where can i see the exact implementation of foldl and foldr?
13:34:42 <Lor> in List.hs
13:36:05 <cbus> hmm *does a find /*
13:38:20 <Lor> http://haskell.org/onlinereport/list.html
13:38:47 <Lor> Oops, sorry, they are in the prelude.
13:38:54 <manulito_> looking for a good recursion example that passes a value, any special tutorial to recommend?
13:39:20 <Lor> http://haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html
13:48:30 <basti_> manulito_: whats the problem, exactly?
13:52:18 <manulito_> cant really formulate the probleml good enough, gonna read alot more first, im kinda new to haskell. thanks anyway
13:52:45 <Itkovian> manulito_: feel free to ask questions
13:54:55 <manulito_> perhaps in 2-3 hours =)
14:02:31 <Itkovian> then I will be fast asleep, I hope
14:30:18 <cbus> hmm what switches should i use to make ghc optimise without screwing things up? ;)
14:32:37 <Lemmih> cbus: -O

15:21:31 <SickJacken> damnit
15:21:59 <metaperl> SickJacken: usuallythe lazy nature prevents that. darcs is an exception because he holds all the patches in memory to compare them
15:25:01 <SickJacken> ow my app is also the exception :P
15:25:29 <SickJacken> hopefully due to the crude implementation of UUAG
15:25:34 <SickJacken> otherwise im a bad coder hehe
15:28:44 <SickJacken> gnight
16:00:05 <wagle> which type system does SPJ describe in his circa 1987 "Implementing Functional Programming Languages" book?
16:00:28 <wagle> (the first book, not the second book from around 1992 or so)
16:05:24 <rt> hmm.  don't remember, and it is on my shelf at home.
16:07:16 <rt> mostly remember for its coverage of lambda lifting (which I implemented at the time) and strictness analysis.
17:04:18 * Korollary wonders what the percentage would have been if the slashdot poll had included "write code in haskell"
17:04:35 <Igloo> ?
17:05:01 <Korollary> http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1312&aid=-1
17:22:57 <Philippa_> <2%, at a guess
20:07:28 <geyzer> is there a good tutorial on how to build trees in haskell?
20:08:42 <Cale> geyzer: what sort of tree? You use a data declaration, or load the Data.Tree module
20:08:54 <Cale> most Haskell tutorials will cover that
20:09:31 <geyzer> ok
20:09:52 <Cale> For instance, a binary tree might look something like:
20:10:04 <Cale> data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
20:10:18 <Cale> whereas, a rose tree would be:
20:10:34 <Cale> data RTree a = Leaf a | Branch [Tree a]
20:10:56 <Cale> if you want data on the branches, you'd stick another 'a' in after "Branch"
20:11:23 <geyzer> oh ok thanks
20:12:03 <creichen> Cale: Where does the name 'rose tree' for this come from?
20:12:50 <Cale> creichen: I'm not sure exactly, that's just what I've heard them called.
20:13:08 <Korollary> actually, this the first time I've heard it
20:13:18 <Cale> Really, they're just rooted, plane-planted trees.
20:13:25 <Cale> er
20:13:36 <Cale> Perhaps just rooted, plane trees.
20:13:58 <creichen> Well, a name is a name, or, as the saying goes, a rose tree by any other name... no, wait...
20:17:30 <Lor> What's the name for a tree where each branch has N inner nodes and N+1 subtrees?
20:17:47 <geyzer> Cale: how would i then create a tree with a parent node and 2 child nodes with data (String or Int)
20:18:22 <Cale> geyzer: Branch (Leaf 5) (Leaf 7)
20:19:09 <geyzer> that looks easy
20:19:54 <sh10151> it is much easier than the equivalent in C
20:23:08 <geyzer> so if i wanted to make a subtree it would be Branch (Branch (Leaf 5) (Leaf 7)) (Leaf 1) ?
20:25:04 <Lor> Easy? In lisp it would be '((5 7) 1) which is admittedly perhaps too easy to be understood. :)
20:25:52 <Cale> geyzer: yeah
20:26:35 <Cale> Lor: but the fact that that's a tree of integers is not enforced
20:27:47 <Lor> That's a typing issue. I just talked about the syntax.
20:29:28 <jedi`> Hey, if you've got an hour or two spare, and would be able to offer me some assistance in completing some excercises i have, please msg me back. Im more than happy to pay you for your help ;p
20:31:07 <Cale> jedi`: what kind of exercises?
20:33:00 <jedi`> cale: i need to write a small function that replaces text ie
20:33:31 <jedi`> myreplace text_to_replace a b
20:33:36 <jedi`> where you swap a with b hehe :)
20:36:48 <Cale> jedi`: well, have you looked at the functions tails, and isPrefixOf, from the List library?
20:37:00 <jedi`> yep very briefly :)
20:40:16 <Cale> they're pretty useful here :)
20:40:32 <Cale> also, drop and ++ :)
20:47:52 <jedi`> yep
20:47:55 <jedi`> thx :)
22:50:44 * aleator is rather impressed by pivotal..
22:53:28 <musasabi> Has anyone got "cgPanicghc-6.5.20050910: panic! (the `impossible' happened, GHC version 6.5.20050910): initC: srt" ?
22:56:14 <dons> never seen that one
23:01:17 <aleator> Anyone familiar with c2hs and cabal? How do I get cabal to pass correct .h file to c2hs or make c2hs look for it itself?
23:04:13 <aleator> Ah. So #includes must be before pragmas.. Hmm..
23:10:33 <aleator> @seen dcoutts
23:10:34 <lambdabot> dcoutts is in #haskell. I don't know when dcoutts last spoke.
23:23:38 <aleator> jedi`: yes?
23:26:52 <jedi`> i need help to do a couple of assignments haha
23:27:40 <aleator> I'm not registered and can't reply to privs.. (Smart freenode?)
23:28:20 <aleator> But feel free to ask.
23:30:08 <vegai> Freenode took the American approach to stopping spambots
23:30:40 <pejo> Massive funding to NSA?
23:31:16 <vegai> Ok, perhaps that was a little harsh. The soviet approach?
23:32:18 <aleator> I have cabalized a package, done setup.hs configure-build-install cycle. And when trying it out with ghci I get: unknown symbol `__stginit_CForeign_'. Any ideas anyone?
23:32:56 <musasabi> aleator: do you have package base in depends?
23:33:10 <jedi`> msn aleator?
23:33:39 <aleator> musasabi: Yes.
23:35:03 <aleator> jedi`: If you have questions about haskell, I think it is ok to ask them here. Or if absolutely necessary to do it "privately" join #someexc
23:40:22 <aleator> musasabi: Do I need some other depends?
23:44:55 <aleator> YES! works.
23:45:10 <aleator> thanks musasabi. It needed haskell98.
