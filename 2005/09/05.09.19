00:01:17 * boegel greets
00:10:48 <gour> dons: ping
00:13:42 <gour> dcoutts: ping
00:25:58 <vegai> how aware is yi of the source it's editing?
00:26:36 <vegai> will there or is there an emacsy-kind of indenting feature?
00:50:31 <dons> vegai, nothing yet. we're just rewriting atm
00:50:39 <dons> expect interesting things in a few weeks
00:52:35 <vegai> mmkay
00:53:46 <boegel> some people in here have an extinsive paper collection, right ?
00:54:55 <boegel> does anyone have the following paper: "Can genetic programming improve software effort estimation? A comaparative evaluation" by C.J. Burgess and M. Lefley ?
00:55:14 <boegel> they're people from Bristol university
00:55:32 <boegel> the paper isn't online, and mailing them hasn't been succesfull (after 2 weeks of waiting)
00:55:50 <Cale> hmm... adding a handler for onDelete seems to cause my window to stop responding to all other events.
00:57:29 <SickJacken> dblhelix , earthy , does anyone of you know if there was maintenance at the uni, because i am unable to log in using ssh for 3 days now
01:00:23 <dblhelix> SickJacken: mmm, I haven't tried to log in this weekend... lemme check the news to see if there's an maintenance annoucement
01:01:21 <SickJacken> k thanks
01:01:30 <dblhelix> SickJacken: no, just an announcement regarding VPN... I presume that's not applicable to your problems
01:01:37 <SickJacken> weird
01:01:50 <SickJacken> im getting 'Connection closed by 131.211.82.40'
01:01:59 <dblhelix> SickJacken: I just did an SSH login... successfully
01:02:02 <SickJacken> :O
01:02:07 <SickJacken> do you see me logged in?
01:02:15 <SickJacken> cause if you do...i might be hacked lol
01:02:20 <dblhelix> just a moment
01:02:22 <SickJacken> sure
01:03:18 <dblhelix> nope, but I can only see staff who's logged in to the staff nw
01:03:38 <dblhelix> I can still login with my student account, though
01:04:03 <SickJacken> huh, the 'w' command in linux only shows you staff members?
01:04:21 <dblhelix> SickJacken: the who does, yeah
01:05:12 <SickJacken> ow ok
01:06:25 <dblhelix> mmm, when I log in with my student account 'w' tells me I'm the only one who's logged in... that's kind of strange... but they've recently give special status to my student account, so I'm not sure whether that's reliable
01:07:16 <SickJacken> ok
01:07:32 <SickJacken> well, i hope they fix it soon.
01:07:39 <SickJacken> maybe i should mail the sysadmin
01:07:58 <dblhelix> that's a good idea; then at least they know there's something to fix
01:08:06 <SickJacken> is that koos? or that other dude
01:08:11 <SickJacken> with the beard
01:08:21 <SickJacken> i always forget
01:08:31 <dblhelix> SickJacken: just mail helpdesk at etc.
01:08:44 <SickJacken> ow right, well thanks in any case
01:08:54 <dblhelix> probably koos will handle this one, yeah
01:10:02 * dblhelix goes eating his apple (once again, the fruit, not his iBook)
01:10:44 <SickJacken> :D
01:13:01 <gour> one apple per day, keeps doctor away
01:13:43 <dblhelix> I feel quite healthy, so that seems about right
01:13:50 <gour> :-)
01:15:04 <SickJacken> i never eat apples
01:15:11 <SickJacken> they make too much noise
01:15:44 <SickJacken> yeaaaah i have a helpdesk ticket
01:15:48 <dblhelix> martin and eelco are not here right now... so it can't bother them
01:16:51 <SickJacken> WOW
01:16:55 <SickJacken> koos fixed it already
01:17:01 <SickJacken> in like...1 or 2 minutes :D
01:17:17 <dblhelix> that's service
01:17:56 <SickJacken> indeed
01:17:58 <SickJacken> (y)
01:19:46 <earthy> you must've caught him *after* getting his first coffee
01:19:54 <earthy> he's normally in a pretty good mood by then. :)
01:20:08 <earthy> the 'bring it on!' mood. :)
01:20:40 <earthy> anyway, let's get to the office
01:23:22 * boegel asks his question again
01:23:26 <boegel> some people in here have an extinsive paper collection, right ?
01:23:28 <boegel> does anyone have the following paper: "Can genetic programming improve software effort estimation? A comaparative evaluation" by C.J. Burgess and M. Lefley ?
01:26:27 <SickJacken> is it possible to redefine or overwrite an existing Show instance? cause im not happy with the one for Set
01:27:52 <dblhelix> SickJacken: in general, no
01:28:04 <SickJacken> darn
01:28:07 <dblhelix> if you have source code available, then of course you can just edit that
01:28:09 <SickJacken> hehehe
01:28:14 <SickJacken> that is true
01:28:53 <dblhelix> otherwise, I guess the most straightforward thing to do would be writing a show function that has another name: show' f.i.
01:29:27 <dblhelix> you could also wrap Set in you own newtype and provode a Show instance for that one
01:29:39 <dblhelix> in summary: just not what you wanted ;)
01:29:47 <earthy> you can hide the show instance when importing the module
01:29:53 <earthy> and then just write your own show instance
01:30:00 <earthy> or import the show instance in a qualified manner
01:30:03 <dblhelix> you can??
01:30:09 <earthy> IIRC, yes
01:30:11 <earthy> lemmecheck
01:30:42 <dblhelix> that'd be... eh... remarkable
01:31:18 <SickJacken> that would be cool, but im already importing Data.Set qualified....
01:32:13 <dblhelix> SickJacken: just to be sure: you're the artist formerly known as HatchetMan who was formerly known as Mon2379, Tue67203, Wed34013, ... ad absurdum?
01:33:01 <dblhelix> aren't you?
01:33:04 <SickJacken> ahahah
01:33:06 <SickJacken> yes
01:33:46 <SickJacken> hatchetman was an occupied nick, believe it or not, so it had to be this one
01:34:14 <dblhelix> SickJacken: I saw your thesis defence was scheduled for next week, but then it got rescheduled or even descheduled?
01:34:28 <earthy> ah, I recalled incorrectly. :)
01:34:47 <earthy> 5.4 states that instances are always implicitly imported and exported
01:35:27 <dblhelix> earthy: I'm glad... it could give you very weird results in some cases
01:35:40 <earthy> why? :)
01:36:27 <SickJacken> dblhelix, its true, that was not my thesis defense though, it was the mandatory colloquium...but since its not mandatory anymore for me...im not wasting time with that :D
01:36:33 <SickJacken> i need all the time i can get anyway
01:36:36 <earthy> ghe
01:37:10 <Blastur> what tool do I use to generate the final document from a LHS-file?
01:37:23 <earthy> lhs2tex, pdflatex?
01:37:37 <dblhelix> well, the whole idea behind ad-hoc polymorphism is that is does not so much give you more expressive power, but that it gives you some convenience... this convenience comes with some implicitness.... implicitness and scoping do not mix very well...
01:37:39 <earthy> or even just plain pdflatex
01:37:51 <boegel> Blastur: you mean the documentation in the LHS-file or something ?
01:37:59 <Blastur> yeah, exactly
01:38:04 <Blastur> everything that is not code
01:38:06 <earthy> but then you'd have to make an environment named code yourself
01:38:08 <boegel> earthy: you mentioned pdflatex twice, do you have stock or something
01:38:29 <earthy> yah. I hate going through DVI if I can avoid it. :)
01:38:31 <boegel> Blastur: grep ?
01:38:40 <boegel> earthy: same here :)
01:38:43 <boegel> pdflatex is great
01:38:56 <Blastur> boegel: well, i'm suppose to generate a PDF or HTML file from my LHS-file :)
01:39:10 <earthy> blastur: run lhs2TeX and then latex
01:39:18 <earthy> and then dvipdfm
01:39:24 <boegel> Blastur: what he said
01:39:27 <earthy> or, easier even, directly run pdflatex. ;)
01:39:37 <boegel> Blastur: lhs2TeX, pdflatex
01:40:45 <Blastur> thanks
01:41:12 <boegel> hi ded
01:41:15 <boegel> new here ?
01:41:44 <ded> boegel: yupp. still very much a beginner...
01:42:32 <boegel> ded: are you learning Haskell ? and if so, why ? fun ? school ? work ?
01:43:10 <dblhelix> boegel: haven't seen shapr yet, so I guess you could fill in and give ded .... (drums) (more drums) the T... (evil laugh)
01:43:39 <boegel> dblhelix: how long ago did you come in here ?
01:43:39 * dblhelix grabs another apple
01:43:45 * gour wonders why is hapr missing THE opportunity
01:43:56 <boegel> gour: moving issues probably
01:44:04 <boegel> gour: who's hapr ? is he new too ? :p
01:44:15 <ded> boegel: did some courses at university - now trying to find some interesting things to do
01:44:25 <gour> boegel: not finished yet, ahh. of course, i meant shapr
01:44:26 <dblhelix> boegel: today? uh... just about an hour ago or something
01:45:11 <boegel> ded: well okay, would you like a tour of the Haskell world ?
01:45:14 <gour> boegel:ahh, i thought he moved already..
01:45:16 <dblhelix> boegel: just after you asked your question for the first time... no, I do not have that paper either ;)
01:45:45 <bortzmeyer2> I'm looking for tutorial / sample code / examples on typical system administration tasks done in Haskell.
01:45:59 <bortzmeyer2> This is typically what people do in Perl but Haskell seems interesting.
01:46:18 <bortzmeyer2> So, examples of text parsing (reading /etc/passwd, for instance) and command running and controlling would be fine.
01:46:27 <araujo> Lisp becoming in haskell? http://lambdassociates.org/qilisp.htm
01:46:29 <araujo> ;-)
01:46:44 <dblhelix> bortzmeyer2: you should talk to dons about h4sh
01:47:07 <ded> boegel: thanks for the offer, but no. just hanging around and maybe stumble upon something interesting
01:47:17 <dblhelix> @google h4sh
01:47:18 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/h4sh.html
01:47:26 <boegel> ded: well, you could check out TMR for some interesting stuff
01:47:35 <boegel> @where TMR
01:47:36 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/tmrwiki/FrontPage
01:47:41 <boegel> ded: ^
01:48:22 <boegel> I think this is the first time someone declined a tour :(
01:48:34 <ded> boegel: thanks, already know that one
01:48:42 <gour> boegel: yours or in general?
01:48:51 <bortzmeyer2> I've checked the Wiki, of course, and foudnnothing
01:49:11 <dblhelix> boegel: no one every refused a tour when shapr was offering it
01:49:13 <boegel> gour: mine, don't know about shapr's
01:49:31 <boegel> s/every/ever ?
01:49:35 <gour> :D
01:49:47 <dblhelix> boegel: thanks, mate
01:49:58 <bortzmeyer2> h4sh seems quite different from what I want, it gives Haskell power to the shell but I'm more intersted in doing shell-like things in Haskell
01:49:59 <boegel> dblhelix: are you saying I shouldn't offer a tour then? I mean, man, pfft, grr
01:50:36 <dblhelix> boegel: no no no... I was to take a tour, I would want you as my guide
01:51:03 * gour want boegel as guide too
01:51:05 <dblhelix> (insert if somewhere)
01:51:31 * boegel is honored
01:51:36 * dblhelix is having difficulties typing when eating his apple
01:51:57 <dblhelix> /s/when/while *sigh*
01:52:32 * gour wonders why dblhelix does not use apple-stand
01:52:49 <dblhelix> gour: rofl
01:53:21 <gour> dblhelix: rofl
01:53:57 * dblhelix hops to #haskell-blah
01:56:16 <earthy> bortzmeyer2: parsing == parsec
01:56:38 <earthy> but why would you want to parse /etc/passwd for yourself?
01:57:03 <earthy> why not use getpwent?
01:57:40 <bortzmeyer2> This was just an example. Let's say /etc/fstab for another example
01:58:46 <bortzmeyer2> And parsec, like happy, seems overkill for typical SA tasks that you could do in one line of Perl or three lines of Python
01:59:07 <earthy> ah
02:06:45 <z0d> what's the difference between Haskell and Clean? they look similar
02:07:26 * shapr hugs boegel 
02:09:41 * boegel hugs back
02:10:07 <musasabi> z0d: Clean uses uniqueness typing, Haskell monads.
02:10:08 <boegel> shapr: you should gather people to vote on the lambdabot contest in #haskell-blah
02:13:54 <earthy> @pastepage
02:13:55 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
02:14:00 <earthy> @paste
02:14:01 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
02:16:41 <earthy> bortzmeyer2: look at http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
02:16:53 <earthy> the top entry shows a trivially simple fstab parser
02:17:07 <earthy> that will ignore comments
02:17:13 <earthy> but not empty lines :)
02:17:49 <earthy> and it'd look nicer with putStr instead of print
02:17:58 <earthy> but you get the idea from this code anyway
02:18:54 <bortzmeyer2> earthy: nice example, exactlay what I was looking for. Thanks
02:18:54 <boegel> people who want to vote on the lambdabot contest, check out the page: http://elis.ugent.be/~kehoste/haskell-blah_lambdabotContest.html
02:20:03 <dcoutts> Cale, use onButtonPress
02:20:43 <earthy> btw: this was about 10 minutes of work, including figuring out the fstab fileformat again ;)
02:20:57 <earthy> and realising that comments were valid fstab ;)
02:20:59 <bortzmeyer2> Yes, but I'm a beginner...
02:21:49 <dcoutts> Cale, as for the onDelete thing, the return value from the event handler usually determines if the event gets intercepted (ie stopped) or propogated (ie the default handler and any other handlers will run)
02:21:55 <dcoutts> gour, pong
02:22:09 <gour> dcoutts: hi
02:22:22 <gour> dcoutts: two issues with hIDE build..
02:23:09 <dcoutts> gour, there's been a flurry of patches recently
02:23:21 <gour> dcoutts: are they in repo?
02:23:34 <dcoutts> so it depends on if you caught it at a buildable point :-)
02:23:41 <dcoutts> yes, mostly in the repo
02:23:52 <gour> ahh ok, i pulled today morning
02:23:57 <dcoutts> but they're merging between the hIDE repo and the yi+gtk repo
02:24:16 <dcoutts> anyway, what was your problem?
02:24:20 <gour> 1st: src/Yi/MkTemp.hs:39: warning for using config.h
02:24:25 <dcoutts> yep
02:24:32 <gour> 2nd: Compiling Yi.Regex         ( src/Yi/Regex.hs, dist/build/Yi/Regex.o )
02:25:00 <gour> there is not YiUtils.h nor Yi/Utils.h
02:26:24 <dcoutts> oh
02:27:10 <gour> have you got, irc ate a part
02:27:38 <dcoutts> gour, hmm why should there be Yi/Utils.h ?
02:28:05 <dcoutts> in mine it says:
02:28:05 <gour> Regex.hsc line: 41
02:28:06 <dcoutts> -- #include "YiUtils.h"
02:28:25 <gour> yes, but there us no such file in my repo
02:28:51 <dcoutts> but the line is commented out so doesn't get #included
02:29:23 <gour> but build complains about it
02:30:05 <dcoutts> ok, remove the line
02:30:11 <dcoutts> btw what gcc version is that?
02:30:40 <gour> gcc version 3.4.4 (Gentoo 3.4.4, ssp-3.4.4-1.0, pie-8.7.8)
02:30:59 <dcoutts> hmm same as me, so no C preprocesor wierdness then
02:31:12 <dcoutts> what does it say exactly?
02:31:35 <gour> Compiling Yi.Regex         ( src/Yi/Regex.hs, dist/build/Yi/Regex.o )
02:31:35 <gour> /tmp/ghc17702.hc:12:21: YiUtils.h: No such file or directory
02:38:47 <dcoutts> gour, ok thats odd, try deleting the line rather than just commenting it out
02:39:03 <dcoutts> @where yi+gtk
02:39:03 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/yi+gtk
02:42:19 <gour> still  the same..
02:42:28 <gour> foreign import ccall  unsafe "YiUtils.h &regfree"
02:42:28 <gour>     ptr_regfree :: FunPtr (Ptr CRegex -> IO ())
02:43:48 <shapr> dons: awake?
02:45:57 <Cale> dcoutts: I got the onButtonPress thing working -- it seems to work better when I use the window than the DrawingArea though.
02:45:59 <dcoutts> gour, ah ok
02:46:09 <Cale> dcoutts: however, the delete thing is strange
02:46:23 <Cale>   windowDraw `onDelete` \e -> do
02:46:23 <Cale>     widgetHideAll windowDraw
02:46:23 <Cale>     return True
02:46:44 <Cale> adding that code stops all the button press and release events from happening
02:46:47 <dcoutts> Cale, true usually means prevent further processing of the event
02:46:57 <dcoutts> try returning false
02:46:58 <Cale> yeah, I want to stop the delete event
02:47:11 <Cale> It's that it's stopping all the other events
02:47:20 <dcoutts> oh, that's odd
02:47:33 <dcoutts> like what other events
02:47:33 <Cale> yeah :)
02:47:44 <Cale> onButtonPress, onButtonRelease
02:47:47 <gour> dcoutts: the other suggestion is to put hIDE under Trac
02:47:53 <Cale> I think onExpose still works
02:47:57 <Cale> I'd have to check that
02:48:27 <gour> dcoutts: Lemmih likes Trac and if shapr can install it on his server
02:48:31 <Cale> yeah, onExpose is fine
02:48:47 <dcoutts> gour, well I have not objection
02:48:51 <gour> dcoutts: and move wiki entries to Trac's wiki...
02:48:52 <dcoutts> not/no
02:48:58 <dcoutts> sure go ahead
02:49:06 <gour> darcs: go one darcs repo...
02:49:13 <gour> shapr: do you hear?
02:49:43 <gour> dcoutts: hIDE is a worthy project to become more organized
02:50:02 <Cale> but by commenting/uncommenting that bit of code, I can swap between having an segfault when the user closes the drawing window, and not accepting any mouse input at all in the drawing window
02:50:23 <Cale> er, when the user closes and attempts to reopen it
02:50:32 <Cale> (since it's been destroyed)
02:50:40 <shapr> gour: I hear, but probably won't have time today.
02:50:50 <poetix> What are the dependencies of hIDE? gtk2hs and...?
02:51:17 <gour> shapr: ok, no rush, the most important that you can satisfy dependencies
02:52:02 <gour> shapr: i saw there is some script in Trac/contrib to move import MoinMoin wiki entries into it
02:53:42 <gour> dcoutts: i'm going to do fresh pull from hIDE and see what's going on
02:53:48 <dcoutts> gour, ok
02:54:13 <dcoutts> Cale, this is indeed peculuiar, do you think you could make a small test case and send it in
02:55:09 <Cale> dcoutts: probably :)
02:55:38 <dcoutts> gour, yeah, I was building without -O and so didn't notice the lack of .h files
02:56:06 <dcoutts> gour, on amd64 you use the via-C backend by default (on x86 it's the asm backend by default)
02:56:23 <dcoutts> so you get the problem
02:56:43 <dcoutts> bug dons or Lemmih about it
02:56:55 <dcoutts> Cale, thanks a lot
03:06:26 <Cale> Interesting, I made a simple version which doesn't seem to recreate the bug...
03:07:15 <dcoutts> interesting indeed
03:07:42 <Cale> I'll try to get closer to what the situation is in Nymphaea
03:14:36 <dcoutts> if you can't pin it down just link to the whole Nymphaea code
03:14:40 <dblhelix> earthy: lunch?
03:14:49 <dcoutts> Cale, so long as it's easily buildable it's ok
03:15:11 <Cale> okay
03:16:50 <Cale> vx.hn.org/autoshare/nymphaea.tar.bz2 -- there's my current repository
03:18:20 <Cale> Compile it and try the UI in the draw window -- you should be able to drag to set the starting position and direction of the LSystem.
03:18:46 <Cale> then uncomment the onDelete code in Nymphaea.hs and try again
03:25:01 <psi> does anyone know why I can't install hs-plugins? 'runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/usr/local' aborts with 'runhaskell: waitForProcess: interrupted (Interrupted system call)'
03:25:17 <psi> (on os x)
03:25:35 <psi> latest version from darcs repo
03:26:22 <dcoutts> Cale, heh, that's cool
03:26:32 <dcoutts> Cale, so what goes wrong?
03:26:49 <dcoutts> Cale, I can click to set the draw starting point
03:27:01 <Cale> even with the delete code turned back on?
03:27:14 <dcoutts> where's that?
03:27:21 <Cale> Nymphaea.hs
03:27:29 <Cale> it's commented out
03:27:45 <Cale> you click to set the starting point and drag to set the direction :)
03:28:06 <dcoutts> oh, nice
03:28:10 <Cale> If you don't drag more than 10 pixels, it won't change the direction though
03:28:23 * dcoutts finds the bit that's commented out
03:29:36 <rep> http://www.zwane.com/blog/images/bushdisaster.jpg
03:30:48 <dcoutts> rep, heh nice
03:31:03 <dcoutts> Cale, yeah, I can reprduce that bug
03:31:49 <Cale> dcoutts: yeah, it's pretty mysterious -- it might be that I'm doing something really unexpected in that code, since it's basically the first time I've done anything with GTK.
03:32:05 <dcoutts> it doesn't look too odd to me
03:32:09 <dcoutts> I'm suprised too
03:32:13 <dcoutts> I'm looking into it
03:33:28 * dcoutts has an idea
03:42:17 <Cale> If you figure it out, let me know -- I should probably get some sleep
03:42:22 <dcoutts> sure
03:42:24 * shapr waves
03:42:27 <shapr> g'night Cale
03:42:38 <Cale> g'night!
03:42:48 <Cale> er, actually, it's almost morning :)
03:42:50 <Cale> hehe
03:42:53 <dcoutts> oh btw shapr did we get ssh/darcs accounts setup?
03:43:02 <dcoutts> no pressure! :-)
03:43:22 <dcoutts> we know you're a busy man with a real job(TM)
03:43:59 <shapr> Not setup yet.
03:44:10 <dcoutts> ok, np
03:44:27 <shapr> what username do you want?
03:44:33 <dcoutts> duncan
03:45:07 * dcoutts only plays dcoutts on irc since duncan was taken
03:46:04 <Muad_Dibber> so slap the other duncan :P
03:46:10 <dcoutts> heh
03:47:09 <dons> psi, this is a known bug on osx with runhaskell. try compiling Setup.hs.
03:47:13 <dons> ghc -o setup Setup.hs
03:47:55 <shapr> Hey, dons, what username?
03:48:01 <dcoutts> dons, I was wondering about making progress on getting a single repo for hIDE and yi+gtk
03:48:11 <dcoutts> so we can all commit easily
03:48:25 <dcoutts> and not have to keep merging
03:49:01 <dons> yep, Lemmih and I discussed a unified yi+gtk today. (replacing the yiBase plugin)
03:49:08 <dcoutts> yes
03:49:30 <dcoutts> so shapr was offering us a server with darcs and ssh access
03:49:32 <dcoutts> so you should tell him what username! ;-)
03:49:33 <dons> the Plugin.hs interface to yi is just an extra entry point to libHSyi.o
03:49:43 <dons> ah, excellent!
03:50:13 <shapr> dcoutts: Ok, try it.
03:50:28 <gour> dons: I have problem building yiBase on amd64
03:50:42 <poetix> dcoutts: What would I need apart from gtk2hs to build hIDE?
03:50:45 * dcoutts is loged into scannedinavian.com
03:50:56 <shapr> yay!
03:51:00 <gour> dons: dcoutts recommends you for bugging :-)
03:51:22 * dcoutts notes that the scannedinavian.org/scannedinavian.com dns problems have gone away
03:51:29 <shapr> happiness!
03:51:37 <dcoutts> poetix, hs-plugins
03:51:54 <dcoutts> shapr, ta muchly!
03:52:27 <dcoutts> gour, wait a bit 'til we've sorted out repos etc, yibase is going away
03:52:28 <poetix> Right. I'm thinking I would like to track development on hIDE, and have a go at building dev versions from time to time
03:52:36 <dcoutts> poetix, cool!
03:52:42 <dcoutts> poetix, add you name to the list:
03:52:44 <dcoutts> @where hIDE
03:52:45 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
03:52:47 <dons> gour, I recommend waiting a few days. things are changing rapidly atm.
03:53:42 <gour> dons: ok, thanks
03:53:59 <dcoutts> Lemmih, oh you asked how we distinguish hIDE plugins from other packages
03:54:28 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I was wondering if perhaps they should use a different package.conf package database
03:54:44 <Heffalump> why not just use a namespace?
03:54:53 <Heffalump> as in HIDE.Plugins....
03:55:05 <dcoutts> Lemmih, eg register them all in ~/.hIDE/plugins.db
03:55:47 <dcoutts> Heffalump, ie anything which provieds an exposed module in that part of the namespace is considered to be a hIDE plugin?
03:56:03 <Heffalump> yes
03:56:22 <Heffalump> oh, you want hIDE to automatically hoover up all such plugins?
03:56:28 <dcoutts> yes
03:57:08 <Heffalump> well, if the standard package database supports querying for all things in a namespace, that seems reasonable.
03:57:11 <dcoutts> they would not necessarily all be loaded automatically, but at least we want to recognise by come conventio which ones are available for loading
03:57:28 <dcoutts> ghc-pkg doesn't really support much of a query language
03:57:41 <Heffalump> hmm
03:58:06 <dcoutts> I think a seperate package db might be good anyway since we expect to have rather a few and it'd save polluting the normal one
03:58:37 <Heffalump> what if a package wants to provide a plugin as well as other stuff?
03:58:40 <dcoutts> otherwise you might get annoied at having 20+ hide-* entries when you do ghc-pkg list
03:59:03 <Heffalump> a package that provides plugins for 20 editors might get annoyed at having to register in 20 databases, though
03:59:16 <dcoutts> Heffalump, true
03:59:25 <Heffalump> dunno either way, really :-)
03:59:34 <poetix> It's unusual I think to have plug-ins installed all over the place. Eclipse, Cubase VST and so on tend to have a plug-ins directory and to query the filesystem for available modules
03:59:45 <dcoutts> however I expect that you couldn't structure it like that anyway
04:00:32 <dcoutts> Heffalump, because you'd need to import each one into your editor plugin,
04:01:11 <dcoutts> Heffalump, you'd need a editor-core + an shim layer for each system you want to plug into, since the plugin must import bits of the app it's pluggin into
04:02:02 <dcoutts> and we'd probabyl clash by all picking the same name for the plugin entry point "dynamic_main" or something
04:02:22 <poetix> Typically in .Net you'd have an assembly containing a bunch of interfaces and some helper classes, which both the plug-in and the pluggable app would reference
04:02:36 <dcoutts> poetix, yeah same here
04:04:13 <dcoutts> poetix, well actually not quite, eg the ideShell plugin directly imports the appBase plugin
04:04:47 <dcoutts> and appBase provides some interfaces and manages the boot process and loading of plugins
04:05:11 <dcoutts> it's pretty similar I guess, but there is not complete seperation of interface and implemention into seperate packages
04:05:21 <psi> i managed to get past my configure issue by compiling Setup.hs instead of using runhaskell
04:07:11 <dcoutts> shapr, so we should set up the repo in /home/hide/public_html/ ?
04:07:46 <shapr> sure
04:08:11 <dcoutts> shapr, presumably we need to be members of a common group to be able to write to a shared darcs repo
04:08:28 <shapr> try it.
04:08:46 <shapr> As in, I think it's setup.
04:08:57 <dcoutts> shapr, oh I'm only in duncan
04:09:07 <dcoutts> oh, it's changed since I logged in
04:09:17 <dcoutts> ah yes it's ok now
04:10:01 <dcoutts> shapr, how does one set the group sticky bit? so all stuff in the /home/hide dir will be group writable by default
04:10:18 <shapr> dcoutts: No clue, it seems to have happened already.
04:10:25 <dcoutts> shapr, oh ok :-)
04:10:39 <Heffalump> are you asking how to set it with chmod?
04:10:45 <keverets> @pirate
04:10:45 <dcoutts> Heffalump, yeah
04:10:46 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
04:10:55 <dcoutts> keverets, @arr
04:10:58 <keverets> @arr
04:10:59 <lambdabot> Get out of me way, yeh landlubber
04:11:00 <dons> /home/hide has the the group sticky bit on
04:11:02 <keverets> dcoutts: thanks ;)
04:11:02 <Heffalump> chmod g+s
04:11:09 <dcoutts> Heffalump, ta
04:11:12 <psi> are there any instructions on how to build hide somewhere?
04:11:26 <shapr> Heffalump: thanks
04:11:29 <Heffalump> or chmod 2775 will set ug+rwx o+rx g+s
04:11:33 <Heffalump> the 2 is the g+s bit
04:11:43 <dcoutts> dons, oh but when I make a new file it's not group writable
04:12:34 <shapr> dcoutts: I can edit files that dons created.
04:12:46 * boegel spams again: vote on your favorite lambdabot look-a-like: http://elis.ugent.be/~kehoste/haskell-lambdabotContest.html
04:12:48 <gour> dcoutts: maybe umask?
04:14:01 <dcoutts> shapr, -rw-r--r--  1 shae hide 0 Sep 19 12:56 /home/hide/foo
04:14:05 <dcoutts> for example
04:14:16 <dons> try fiddling with your umask
04:14:17 <dcoutts> yeah, maybe umask will help
04:14:23 * dcoutts wonders how to do that
04:14:34 <shapr> dcoutts: Are you unable to edit files I create?
04:14:36 <dcoutts> unamsk ???
04:14:39 <dcoutts> shapr, indeed
04:15:03 <shapr> Does "groups" show hide? You may need to logout and login again.
04:15:21 <dons> umask 022 ?
04:15:28 <dcoutts> shapr, it does show I'm  in hide, but the file is not group writable
04:15:31 <dcoutts> dons, ta
04:16:54 <shapr> Mine is set to 022, what should it be?
04:17:14 <dcoutts> oh mine too
04:17:23 <hellish> Is there an image library for Haskell? I need one with pixel lever editing and output to PNG.
04:17:27 <dcoutts> but I'm not making group writable files
04:17:48 <dcoutts> hellish, Gtk2Hs provides that but perhaps is more than you want
04:18:21 <earthy> isn't there a gd binding? :P
04:18:24 <hellish> dcoutts: Do you mean pixbufs?
04:18:30 <dcoutts> hellish, yes
04:18:39 <gour> gaura-nitai gour # umask 002
04:18:39 <gour> gaura-nitai gour # umask -S
04:18:39 <gour> u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx
04:18:44 <dcoutts> shapr, ah umask 002
04:18:50 <shapr> ah, ok
04:19:05 * dcoutts goes to change his umaks in his ~/.bash_profile
04:19:33 <shapr> btw, do you want zsh instead?
04:19:37 * shapr hugs zsh
04:19:58 * dcoutts hugs bash
04:20:17 <shapr> I wonder if there's a way to have umask 002 only for /home/hide ?
04:20:47 <dcoutts> shapr, that's what I was wondering, I thought that the sticky bit + makeing the dir group writable did that
04:20:52 <earthy> http://www.acooke.org/jara/pancito/ might be of interest as well, hellish
04:21:13 <hellish> dcoutts: I see a way to get the pixels out of a pixbuf as an array, but not a way to set them. Am I missing something, or are you?
04:21:33 <dcoutts> hellish, it provides a mutable array interface
04:22:03 <dcoutts> hellish, there is a demo that shows how to use it
04:22:26 * hellish looks
04:22:54 <dcoutts> hellish, demo/fastdraw/FastDraw.hs
04:24:18 <dcoutts> shapr, now the public_html dir needs to be group writable
04:25:10 <Lemmih> gour: pong.
04:25:54 <shapr> dcoutts: ok, anything else?
04:26:09 <dcoutts> shapr, don't think so, looks good thanks
04:26:10 <shapr> if you figure out per-dir umask, I want to know!
04:26:32 <dcoutts> yeah, me too
04:27:00 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so I think we're ready to move the hIDE repo to the shared hide dir
04:27:19 <dcoutts> Lemmih, make sure your umaks is set to 002 in your ~/.bash_profile
04:27:39 <dcoutts> rather than the 022 default
04:42:19 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I've copied over your repo to scannedinavian.org:~hide/hIDE
04:42:25 <dcoutts> I think the perms are right
04:44:21 <dons>     yep. works for me
04:44:33 <dons> at least, it is readable
04:44:35 <boegel> shapr: how's FLM ? :D
04:44:48 <dcoutts> dons, but I can't get it by http yet
04:45:37 <dons> now, should yi+gtk also go up? I guess so. Lemmih?
04:45:59 <dcoutts> oh wait a sec the ~hide user has a home of /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide
04:46:14 <dons> Lemmih, did you see my remarks earlier about yi+gtk basically ready to go into hIDE. just neads tweaking Plugin.hs
04:46:16 <dcoutts> shapr, which location should we be using?
04:46:21 <Lemmih> dons: Yeah.
04:47:19 <dons> is that ok with you? to work on yi+gtk instead of yiBase?
04:48:12 <dons> merging in anything that is in yiBase but should be in yi+gtk
04:48:31 <Lemmih> Yeah, it's OK.
04:49:27 <dcoutts> so where should the repo be?
04:49:29 <dcoutts> http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hide/
04:49:43 <dcoutts> that's the one that corresponds to /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide/repo
04:50:01 <dcoutts> or /home/hide/public_html/hIDE
04:50:12 <dcoutts> which is not currently accessable by the web
04:50:18 <dons> can the one be a link to the other?
04:50:52 <dcoutts> if we just make the /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide/repo writable to us lot then that'd be ok and more uniform with the other repos on http://scannedinavian.org/repos/
04:50:57 <dcoutts> shapr, advice?
04:51:38 <shapr> Sorry, was having lunch..
04:51:42 * shapr reads the scrollback
04:51:43 <dcoutts> np
04:51:55 <Lemmih> shapr: I've mailed you my public key.
04:52:01 <shapr> ok
04:52:15 <shapr> Lemmih: you already have an account on scannedinavian.org :-P
04:53:03 <Lemmih> hIDE will be writable for everyone with an account on scannedinavian.org?
04:53:29 <dcoutts> Lemmih, yes everyone in the hide unix group
04:53:48 <dcoutts> $ grep hide /etc/group
04:53:48 <dcoutts> hide:x:1017:shae,dons,duncan,lemmih,boegel,flippa
04:54:11 <boegel> where should I hide ?
04:54:18 <dons> we should host the yi+gtk repo on scannedinavian.org too, next to the hIDE repo
04:54:20 <shapr> in /home/hide obviously!
04:54:24 <boegel> I don't know scratch about hide, why am I in there ?
04:54:30 <dcoutts> boegel, I dunno
04:54:44 <Lemmih> We're drafting developers.
04:54:53 <shapr> boegel: You've been drafted.
04:55:07 <shapr> Sigsegv__: Hiya, learning Haskell?
04:55:33 <boegel> drated ? :|
04:55:43 * shapr grins
04:55:50 <boegel> <insert> f
04:56:14 <dcoutts> shapr, so do we need /home/hide at all if it's all going to be in /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide/
04:56:15 <Lemmih> Is there some way I can avoid typing my password twice every time I push a patch?
04:56:27 <dcoutts> Lemmih, setup the ssh key
04:56:31 <shapr> Lemmih: use ssh-agent
04:56:40 <shapr> and/or ssh -M
04:57:01 <dcoutts> what does ssh-agent do?
04:57:12 <dcoutts> keep ssh connections around?
04:57:50 <Lemmih> Can I use ssh-agent without spawning a new process?
04:57:55 <dons> keeps keys around
04:57:59 <dons> so you don't have to retype passwds
04:58:07 <dons> ssh -M reusues connections
04:58:13 <dons> so logging in is faster
04:59:02 <Lemmih> shapr: Can you add my key even though I already have an account?
04:59:33 <Sigsegv__> shapr: Yes!
04:59:38 <dcoutts> Lemmih, you can just add it to your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
05:00:20 <shapr> Lemmih: sure
05:00:33 <Sigsegv__> shapr: I have a big test to pass in another functional language
05:01:08 <shapr> Which language? ML?
05:01:12 <dcoutts> shapr, so should we use /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide ? if so then it needs to be hide group writable
05:01:15 <Sigsegv__> shapr: OPAL
05:01:37 <dcoutts> shapr, and the /home/hide dir should die or it'll confuse us
05:01:47 <Sigsegv__> <- searchs for a link
05:01:59 <shapr> Sigsegv__: http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh//faq.html#opal
05:02:08 <shapr> dcoutts: I'm thinking...
05:02:21 <Sigsegv__> shapr: mist
05:02:39 <Sigsegv__> shapr: http://uebb.cs.tu-berlin.de/opal/
05:02:55 <gour> Lemmih: it was regarding hIDE build on amd64...
05:03:19 <Sigsegv__> I try to solve the 8 queens problem in haskell
05:03:22 <shapr> Ah
05:03:25 <gour> Lemmih: you can see in log, but dons suggested to wait a bit...
05:03:46 <Lemmih> ah ok.
05:03:53 <gour> Lemmih: and i see you're busy  with moving to shapr's site
05:04:09 <dcoutts> shapr, so I suggest chgrp hide /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide
05:04:10 <gour> Lemmih: if shapr puts Trac on, i'll open a ticket :-)
05:04:26 <dcoutts> shapr, and chmod g+ws /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide
05:06:16 <dcoutts> shapr, or alternatively just make the hide users hoem dir be /home/hide/
05:06:28 <gour> Lemmih: regarding ssh-agent, is there keychain on the server?
05:06:56 <shapr> Sigsegv__: I've seen nice 8-queens solutions online.
05:07:31 <Lemmih> gour: I have no idea (:
05:08:21 <shapr> dcoutts: /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide is for emailed patches. Why don't I just symlink it to /home/hide/repo or wherever it really will be??
05:08:22 <gour> shapr: do you have keychain on the server so Lemmih can use ssh-agent without spawning a new process?
05:08:38 <dcoutts> shapr, ok
05:08:44 <shapr> dcoutts: email is slow and requires configuration, ssh push is fast.
05:08:56 <Sigsegv__> shapr: Moment
05:09:03 <shapr> This would all be solved if someone wrote gpg-cgi push for darcs.
05:09:05 <dcoutts> shapr, yes ssh push is better since it gives errors back immediately
05:09:18 <dcoutts> shapr, yeah that'd be cool
05:10:21 <dcoutts> that'd make things really convenient since you could do darcs push on any php enabled webserver
05:10:29 <xerox> DAV?
05:10:39 <shapr> Actually, any webserver with cgi support, you wouldn't need php support.
05:11:15 <dcoutts> oh ok, most servers will run .cgi as a cgi prog then by default?
05:11:36 <shapr> With some configuration, and from a certain dir, yes.
05:11:47 <dcoutts> you want something with no special webserver config required
05:13:03 <rep> relax. don't do it. when you want to go do it.
05:13:16 * shapr relaxes rep with a stick!
05:13:34 <shapr> dcoutts: Most webservers require some config to do cgi only because they used to require no special config, and it was a security hole.
05:13:54 <shapr> rep: Want to work on hIDE?
05:14:19 <rep> unfortunately, shapr, my time is already taken, these days :(
05:14:24 <dcoutts> shapr, whereas most will do .php quite happily :-)
05:14:31 <shapr> dcoutts: That's bizarre.
05:14:31 <boegel> shapr: pm
05:14:44 <dcoutts> shapr, security? what security?
05:15:21 * shapr is scared of php suddenly.
05:15:27 <orbitz> suddenly?
05:15:30 * orbitz has been scard for awhile
05:15:45 <shapr> I used to be contemptuous, now I'm also scared.
05:16:00 <dons> I much prefer ssh for this kind of stuff. don't trust anything else
05:16:08 * dcoutts agrees with dons
05:16:21 * dcoutts checks if shapr's server supports php by default
05:16:59 * rep notes php is evil
05:17:23 <earthy> php is not evil
05:17:26 <earthy> it's merely misled
05:17:31 <earthy> and mistaken
05:18:31 * dcoutts finds that shapr's server is more secure than to do .php by default
05:19:27 <shapr> dcoutts: But it might work in ~/public_html/cgi
05:19:37 <shapr> I've turned on cgi there.
05:20:25 <dcoutts> shapr, I'd reckon the way darcs should do it to make it ultra-easy to setup would be to put an xmlrpc-push.php in the _darcs/ dir
05:20:47 <dcoutts> so it'd work by default for the majority of php enabled webservers
05:20:56 <dcoutts> and then provide alternatives for the more paranoid
05:21:24 <dcoutts> since the script is not likely to be very complex
05:21:28 <shapr> I think php uses the cgi interface, so a cgi app should work wherever php works.
05:21:52 <dcoutts> servers with mod_php will typically allow .php files anywhere
05:22:36 <dcoutts> anyway, more immediate matters, where is the hIDE darcs repo going to be?
05:22:47 <dcoutts> and where will it appear on the website
05:23:22 * dcoutts wants to start pushing patches
05:24:28 <shapr> I say put it into /home/hide/public_html/ somewhere
05:24:42 <xerox> shapr: did you see this? http://haskell.galois.com/~paolo/nymphaea/
05:24:59 <xerox> Oh, and poetix too, there is the code, finally :-)
05:25:10 <shapr> Wow, gorgeous background
05:25:34 <dcoutts> shapr, ok then what about the http url ?
05:25:34 <xerox> Yesterday I tried unleashing the artistic vein.
05:25:54 <dcoutts> xerox, it's erally nice
05:26:00 <dcoutts> erally/really
05:26:24 <xerox> Modified something some mins ago, I'm quite happy with it too :-D
05:26:25 <shapr> dcoutts: I can symlink to /var/lib/repos/hide once you create a repo.
05:26:31 <xerox> Maybe the transparence...
05:26:36 <dcoutts> shapr, we've made the repo
05:26:44 <poetix> xerox: Nice one!
05:26:48 <shapr> xerox: beautiful!
05:27:02 <dcoutts> shapr, /home/hide/public_html/hIDE/ is just a copy of Lemmih's latest repo
05:27:04 <xerox> Thanks much!
05:27:09 <boegel> xerox: nice :)
05:27:21 <poetix> Text is not super-readable, against the stippled background
05:27:30 <poetix> And the darcs url overruns into the menus on the right
05:27:40 <xerox> Oh :-\
05:27:46 <dcoutts> xerox, the "darcs get http://haskell.galois.com/~paolo/darcs/nymphaea" overrruns
05:27:53 * dcoutts notices that was already pointed out
05:27:58 <xerox> It does not here, but thanks, I'll try to fix it.
05:28:06 <shapr> dcoutts: http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hIDE/
05:28:13 <dcoutts> shapr, ah ok
05:28:16 <xerox> Could you do a screenshot to see how does it show up on your computer?
05:28:28 <gour> xerox: it does on konqi, but not on ff
05:28:48 <xerox> I think I know how to fix it...
05:29:01 <boegel> xerox: cool background image, I love it :)
05:29:29 <dcoutts> shapr, but that's a differnt copy! it's not a symlink
05:29:37 * shapr blinks
05:29:41 <xerox> Does it still do it?
05:29:47 <dcoutts> look in /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide/
05:29:54 <xerox> boegel: Me too!
05:30:04 <dcoutts> shapr, that's a whole copy (which is in the nobody group)
05:30:28 <dcoutts> shapr, it's not the same as the repo we've got in /home/hide/public_html/hIDE
05:30:31 <xerox> poetix: 1) is the <pre> text still overrunning? 2) what do you suggest for the background/text issue?
05:30:47 <dcoutts> shapr, which is why I was wondering which one you wanted us to use
05:31:09 <shapr> dcoutts: I'll delete the /var/lib/darcs/repos/hide dir.
05:32:15 <shapr> The repo url I gave is the one in /home/hide/public_html/hIDE/
05:32:33 <dcoutts> shapr, ok
05:33:16 <poetix> xerox: 1) Yes, it is. 2) Use a solid (but alpha-blended, transparent) background instead of a stippled background?
05:33:40 <xerox> poetix: what is the CSS syntax for the solid one?
05:33:54 <xerox> Couldn't find it yesterday.
05:34:40 <boegel> xerox: 'solid' ? :)
05:34:40 <poetix> I should remember - I over-used it something chronic on my own site a while back
05:35:00 <poetix> Ah, wait...
05:35:17 <poetix> You can make the whole div transparent, but that would include the text as well - not what you want
05:35:39 <dcoutts> shapr, ok ping me when the new repo is accessable
05:35:59 <shapr> Isn't it already?
05:36:03 * boegel laughs
05:36:06 <poetix> Alternatively, do what they do on css-edge, and have two versions of the background image, one alpha-blended with a solid grey rectangle
05:36:14 <boegel> shapr: you're quite confused today, aren't you ?
05:36:20 <shapr> dcoutts: Can't you push and pull from the one in public_html/hIDE ?
05:36:35 <shapr> boegel: Yeah, I stayed up late partying for my birthday yesterday.
05:36:43 <dcoutts> shapr, http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hide/ gives 403 error
05:36:44 <poetix> Then make the greyed-out image the background image for the div, just as an opaque image
05:36:45 <shapr> I've had about eight hours sleep in the last two nights.
05:36:49 <boegel> shapr: hey, I wasn't invited :(
05:37:05 <dcoutts> shapr, ah it's now "hIDE"
05:37:56 <poetix> http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/glassy.html <- this is especially cool, but breaks on IE
05:38:20 <shapr> dcoutts: I'm symlink it to hide also
05:38:39 <xerox> poetix: but this is an image
05:38:50 <shapr> dcoutts: ok, done.
05:39:06 <dcoutts> shapr, ok
05:39:19 <dcoutts> shapr, I can pull now, let me try pushing
05:39:27 <poetix> xerox: OK, so why make it stippled instead of greyed-out?
05:39:57 <xerox> poetix: dunno
05:40:13 <poetix> xerox: That's all I'm saying - it makes the text slightly harder to read...
05:40:32 <xerox> I'll try, :)
05:42:55 <dcoutts> shapr, yeah seems to work fine now
05:43:04 <shapr> spiffy!
05:43:27 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok, so the new repo is up
05:43:39 <shapr> The pretty darcs.cgi browser also works --> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/hide/?c=browse
05:43:56 <Pete_I> is there a haskell interpretter for win32?
05:44:03 <dcoutts> Lemmih, it's a copy of your current repo at http://scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/hIDE as of a couple hours ago
05:44:23 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so make sure it's in sync with your current stuff and swtich repo

05:45:26 <shapr> hiya Pete_I, learning Haskell?
05:45:43 <Pete_I> i would if i could find an interpretter for win32.
05:46:01 <shapr> Pete_I: Yes, hugs is a haskell interpreter for win32. GHC is a haskell compiler for win32. (and they both work on Linux, OSX, etc)
05:46:04 <dblhelix> Pete_I: hugs, ghci
05:46:12 <dcoutts> ah the hIDE wiki has already been updated ;-0
05:47:55 <Pete_I> thanks, i'll check into that
05:48:38 <dcoutts> Lemmih, dons are you using the new hIDE repo ok then? dons and what about the yi+gtk?
05:49:04 <dcoutts> dons, is the yi+gtk going to be in a seperate repo? or in the hIDE repo under plugins/
05:50:03 <Lemmih> dcoutts: The repo is at /home/hide/hIDE, right?
05:52:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, /home/hide/public_html/hIDE
05:53:21 <dcoutts> and from the web http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hIDE/
05:53:57 <shapr> I'm thinking I should change www.scannedinavian.org to show a page saying something about a "Haskell Research Collective"
05:54:28 <dcoutts> heh, yeah
05:55:09 <dcoutts> haskell-hacking.org -> scannedinavian.org
05:55:24 <shapr> heh :-)
05:55:44 <xerox> I can't succeed in making a little green transparent image...
05:56:35 <dcoutts> xerox, btw having "porn" on that page can lead to it being blocked by many unis :-(
05:56:53 <xerox> Ouch... sorry.
05:57:01 * dcoutts knows some oxford colleges that are rather anal about that
05:57:10 <shapr> hah
05:57:33 <xerox> Done. dcoutts.
05:59:01 <dcoutts> apparently it's become a sport in such places to fill the http cache logs with entries like: http://hot-porn.com/xxxx_college's_IT_manager_is_an_anal_xxxxer.html
05:59:46 <dcoutts> because they know the guy checks what get's blocked by the web cache
06:00:18 <Pete_I> haha
06:00:29 <Philippa> there're many reasons to live in private accomodation at uni - that sort of shit's one of them
06:00:30 <earthy> lord, that's a stupid waste
06:00:35 <dons> dcoutts, hmm. I think I'd prefer yi+gtk to be a separate repo, as it will be a standalone editor without hIDE. is that ok?
06:00:37 <Pete_I> that's why they invented google translations.
06:00:53 <Philippa> a friend's moved into a hall where the AUP outlaws about half of what I do on IRC, including kicking or k/bing people for being abusive
06:01:01 <dcoutts> dons, ok so where will the hIDE plugin live, which repo?
06:01:15 <earthy> http://hete-sex.nl/de_systeembeheerder_van_blabla_college_is_een_xxxxxzak.html ? :)
06:01:39 <shapr> Today's #haskell logs shall be inaccessible to colleges.
06:01:43 <dons> yi+gtk provides the hIDE plugin. yi+gtk should get copied onto scannedinavian.com next to hide proper, I think
06:02:32 <dcoutts> dons, hmm, but many plugins will want to use both
06:02:45 <dcoutts> dons, it'll make the build system a little tricky
06:03:02 <dcoutts> dons, how is the hIDE plugin related to the rest of the code?
06:03:05 <dons> hmm. you don't think that you just install yi+gtk, install hIDE, and away we go?
06:03:32 * xerox convinced another guy to try to make up his way through Haskell - via xerox's gobby-lessons! :-D
06:03:34 <dons> do you mean the hIDE-interface to yi+gtk?
06:04:15 <dcoutts> dons, er I guess so
06:04:58 <dcoutts> dons, it's just that the yi plugin for hIDE will depend on other hIDE plugins and other hIDE plugins will depend on the yi plugin
06:05:10 <dons> ah, I see.
06:05:21 <dcoutts> dons, I was wondering if the plugin shouldbe in the hide repo and it depedns on the yi core
06:05:26 <musasabi> Here the network access offered by the tech. univ is better than the commercial offerings.
06:05:52 <dcoutts> dons, so then as a whole hIDE just depends on the yi core
06:06:08 <musasabi> We have a 14gb/week do what you want as long as nobody comes charging in policy.
06:06:14 <dcoutts> dons, because it provides the gtk UI for yi and the other intergration bits
06:06:28 <dons> oh, but the plugin is the same as the yi core
06:06:40 <dons> the plugin is just one extra module, Plugin.hs, that comes with the yi core
06:06:48 <dcoutts> dons, realy? hmm, I thought that yi UIs could be Yi plugins
06:07:11 <dons> not at the moment, and I'm working only on gtk yi for now
06:07:20 <dcoutts> ok, hmm
06:07:58 <dons> so I'm suggesting that the yi core stay as a separate standalone repo.
06:08:03 <dons> and that hIDE depends on the yi core
06:08:07 <dcoutts> yes me too
06:08:21 <dons> probably we'll add extra yi-extension plugins to hIDE along the way though
06:08:22 <shapr> musasabi: nice!
06:08:58 <dcoutts> I'm just thinking that there will be plugins that depend on the yi plugin and other hIDE plugins
06:09:10 <dons> yep. those should go in hIDE
06:09:34 <dcoutts> ok, it just complicates the build/distribution for the moment
06:09:59 <dons> but the yi core won't depend on anything
06:10:18 <dons> I think there is a confusion in terminology. the yi core *is* the yi plugin, atm
06:10:24 <dcoutts> the Yi/Plugins.hs depends on some hIDE bits presumably
06:10:33 <dcoutts> like the gui shell
06:10:54 <dons> hmm. it doesn't yet, hmm, but it might, true. then it should go in hIDE
06:11:19 <dcoutts> dons, yeah, the confusion was that I was thinking in terms of yi having multiple swapple UIs
06:11:25 <dons> yi core provides a very basic plugin interface, but it may have to be a small wrapper plugin kept in hIDE.
06:11:41 <dons> as you say, it will depend on the gui shell
06:11:55 <dcoutts> right, and I was thinking that wrapper should live in the hIDE repo and build-depend on yi
06:12:02 <dons> yep. sounds good
06:12:21 <dcoutts> that way yi does not depend on any hIDE packages
06:12:25 <dons> we keep a clean separation that yi can be built standalone without hIDE, then
06:12:31 <poetix> How does yi interact with a UI? Does it raise events?
06:12:32 <dcoutts> yes ideally
06:13:15 <dons> the ui passes char input over to yi, which then interprets them using emacs or vim-style lexing of that input
06:13:19 <dcoutts> if yi can support multile UIs as plugins then we get that for free of course, the hIDE/yi wrapper plugin thingy just always selectes the gtk UI
06:13:21 <poetix> I'm imagining something vaguely MVC-ish
06:13:34 <dons> dcoutts, yep.
06:13:34 <dcoutts> poetix, yes it is MVCish
06:13:50 <dcoutts> the UI design for hIDE calls for MVC
06:14:07 <ndm> Given: (\datastructure newvalue -> datastructure{fieldname=newvalue})
06:14:08 <dcoutts> we want multiple views into the same editor buffer
06:14:10 <poetix> So how does yi pass back to the UI information about what should change as a result of some input being parsed and executed?
06:14:14 <ndm> is there anyway to reduce the textual length of that
06:14:20 <ndm> other than shortening teh indentifiers
06:14:41 <dcoutts> poetix, at the moment Yi when working with gtk/hIDE uses a GtkTextBuffer as it's buffer
06:15:01 <poetix> So you can hook into GtkTextBuffer events
06:15:06 <dcoutts> poetix, and that GtkTextBuffer is connected to one or more GtkTextViews
06:15:07 <SamB> dcoutts: that sounds pretty sad...
06:15:17 <SamB> oh, maybe not as bad as I thought
06:15:21 <dcoutts> SamB, sad?
06:15:28 <dcoutts> SamB, it works well so far
06:15:46 <SamB> didn't realize GtkTextBuffer was not a widget
06:15:54 <dons> yi calls Gtk functions that then effect buffers held by gtk
06:16:09 <dcoutts> SamB, right
06:16:22 <dcoutts> then we intercept the input to the GtkTextView and pass it to Yi instead
06:17:09 <dons> yi basically runs in a separate thread interpreting char input intercepted from the GtkTextView
06:17:11 <dcoutts> so we're sort of using the TextView as only the View in the MVC pattern and we to the 'C' part ourselves via Yi's normal input mechanisms
06:17:25 <xerox> MVC = ?
06:17:25 <poetix> And the Model is the TextBuffer
06:17:31 <poetix> Model, View, Controller
06:17:46 <dcoutts> poetix, right the Model is the TextBuffer
06:17:57 <dcoutts> poetix, we make it an instance of Yi's Buffer class
06:18:13 <poetix> So other buffers are possible, too
06:18:25 <dcoutts> where as for the ncurses UI we use an implementation using Haskell arrays
06:18:34 <dcoutts> or was it ForignPtr Char
06:18:40 <dons> the latter
06:19:00 <dons> and then you just pass ptrs to C Strings over to ncurses to render
06:19:06 <dcoutts> anyway FastBuffer is a pure Haskell implementation and an instance of the Buffer class
06:19:09 <poetix> How does the TextBuffer communicate updates to the TextView, and can we intercept those messages?
06:19:48 <dcoutts> poetix, gtk already has the communication mechanism between the TextBuffer and the TextView
06:19:54 * humasect_ suddenly sees 'Forest' in Data.Tree, then backs out
06:20:03 <dcoutts> it's done via GObject signals
06:20:19 <dcoutts> when the TextBuffer changes, it notifies the TextViews
06:20:29 <poetix> But other Yi Buffers don't have an equivalent mechanism for notifying some View of changes to them?
06:20:47 <dcoutts> the signals can probably be intercepted but I don't think we need to
06:21:14 <dcoutts> poetix, you'll have to ask dons about how the ncurses interface is updated when the buffer changes
06:21:15 <poetix> You don't think anything other than an editing view will ever be interested in changes to the underlying buffer?
06:21:47 <xerox> Mouse clicks?
06:21:48 <dons> when the buffer changes in the ncurses code, an mvar is touched. a ui render thread sits on that mvar and redraws when it is filled
06:21:55 * poetix makes "obby, obby, obby" noises
06:22:02 <dcoutts> poetix, I'm sure it will, but that will use a Haskell interface rather than going via the specialised TextBuffer/TextView communication interface
06:22:07 * xerox starts waving
06:22:16 <poetix> Right.
06:22:35 <poetix> Getting notifications from the buffer about changes shouldn't depend on which buffer implementation you're using
06:22:36 <dcoutts> poetix, though I imagine the interface might be similar, but more Haskelly
06:23:21 <dcoutts> poetix, yes, the TextBuffer/TextView interface should not be used for anything else, it's just speial and the easiest way of integrating Yi with Gtk
06:23:37 <dons> exactly
06:24:10 <dcoutts> we should write more of this down in the wiki
06:24:36 <poetix> What I'm interested in here is being able to plug collaborative editing into hIDE
06:24:44 * shapr wants to hear about that too
06:24:46 <dcoutts> poetix, that'd be cool
06:24:57 * dons gets some sleep
06:25:04 <xerox> Goodnight dons!
06:25:06 <shapr> g'night dons!
06:25:07 <dcoutts> g'night dons
06:25:46 * dcoutts right clicks on a module in hIDE and selects "share this module"
06:26:10 <poetix> Making a libobby buffer an instance of the Haskell Buffer typeclass might get you almost all of the way there
06:26:47 <poetix> But it has to be able to be updated by a different controller than Yi (e.g. by a notification arriving from a session on another machine)
06:27:10 <poetix> And it has to be able to notify updates to the session as well as to the immediate client view
06:27:19 <dcoutts> hmm not sure about making it a Buffer instance, shouldn't an obby session attach to an existing buffer
06:27:50 <poetix> libobby has its own buffer implementation...
06:27:54 <dcoutts> hmm
06:28:04 <dcoutts> then we'd need two way sync
06:28:16 <dcoutts> how does that work with gtk? in gobby?
06:28:25 <poetix> It's not obligatory to use libobby of course, but gobby-compatibility would be nice
06:28:36 <poetix> libobby uses libsigc++ to raise events
06:28:54 <dcoutts> they must use a GtkTextBuffer for their editor view so they must sync a obby buffer with the GtkTextBuffer
06:29:28 <dcoutts> poetix, to raise what events in what?
06:30:01 <dcoutts> the GtkTextBuffer is not an interface that you can do custom implementations of (sadly)
06:30:01 <poetix> It's C++, so you have a ClientBuffer instance which exposes various "signal" objects as public members
06:30:20 <poetix> You can register function or method pointers to be called when one of these signals is fired
06:30:48 <dcoutts> sure but the GtkTextBuffer cannot be sublcassed in such a way as to use a different underlying buffer
06:30:49 <poetix> e.g. when something calls signal.emit() on the signal
06:31:13 <dcoutts> it doesn't expose the right virtual methods (ie overridable ones) to be able to do that
06:32:00 <poetix> I guess they handle those events, then maybe update a GtkTextBuffer accordingly
06:32:09 <poetix> Which then causes the update to the TextView
06:32:31 <dcoutts> I'd be interested to see just how they do it, it might give us some hints
06:32:51 <poetix> Now I think of it, I'm not so certain that the ClientBuffer object keeps its own copy of the buffer data - I haven't looked into what the Document class actually represents
06:33:09 <poetix> It might represent the identity of a shared document, rather than an actual physical bag of chars
06:33:16 <dcoutts> that'd be better
06:34:08 <poetix> It would make sense for it to leave management of the client's physical buffer to the client, so that e.g. gobby could just use a GtkTextBuffer to do it
06:34:16 <dcoutts> right
06:34:34 <dcoutts> and we'd use any Yi Buffer instance
06:35:10 <poetix> Yes, with a libobby ClientBuffer representing the synchronization layer with the shared session
06:35:24 <dcoutts> yes
06:35:40 <poetix> That's better anyway, as a plug-in, because it's further away from the "core"
06:35:48 <dcoutts> indeed
06:36:10 <poetix> Well, I have a long way to go with libobby anyway, but it's worth thinking about how it might work
06:36:58 <poetix> And I'm still not certain that doing a pure Haskell implementation of a shared document session wouldn't be better in some ways
06:37:26 <dcoutts> it might be, but compatabilty might be nice too
06:37:36 <dcoutts> a pure Haskell implementation might be simpler
06:38:16 <poetix> It really complicates things that libobby is C++ :(
06:38:26 <dcoutts> yeah :-(
06:39:08 <dcoutts> well you could just borrow designs and ideas, or even the wire protocol
06:39:19 <poetix> The wire protocol's based on libnet6
06:39:29 <dcoutts> which is C++ I bet yeah?
06:39:33 <poetix> Oh yeah
06:39:45 <poetix> You create message objects, and "pack" values into them using the left shift operator...
06:40:04 <poetix> Then "unpack" them at the other end
06:40:10 <musasabi> But you can create marshallers trivially in Haskell too.
06:40:13 <dcoutts> it's wire format is not externally definable easily?
06:40:33 <poetix> I don't know exactly what libnet6 does internally
06:40:56 <poetix> It might for instance do some cryptographic munging
06:41:04 <dcoutts> hmm
06:41:18 <poetix> From the point of view of the client, it's all transparent
06:41:57 <poetix> You point an object at an endpoint, tell it how to log in, and then exchange messages with it
06:43:03 <shapr> Hey, anyone know of something that takes pdf and ps files and outputs SVG for each page?
06:43:37 <dcoutts> evince should be able to do that once the cairo svg backend works
06:43:41 <dcoutts> but not yet
06:43:44 <shapr> ah, nifty.
06:44:40 * boegel repeats: VOTE NOW on lambdabot ! http://elis.ugent.be/~kehoste/haskell-blah_lambdabotContest.html (you can use pm instead of email too)
06:45:02 <shapr> Will evince PDF to SVG work on windows?
06:45:06 * shapr doubts it
06:45:08 <vegai> are there surprise prizes involved?
06:45:27 <musasabi> shapr: convert from imagemagick maybe.
06:45:28 <vegai> #haskell-blah, what what what?
06:45:28 <dcoutts> poetix, oh net6 is by the obby people too
06:45:36 <boegel> vegai: that could be consired
06:45:46 <shapr> musasabi: I'm using imagemagick right now, does it do SVG output?
06:46:21 * shapr asks google
06:46:49 <poetix> dcoutts: I think I'll press on with the libobby wrapper for the moment - if nothing else, it will mean reading through the source of a library that does something like what I want
06:46:57 <xerox> dcoutts: hmm how would evince will be able to do it?
06:47:01 <dcoutts> poetix, true
06:47:07 <xerox> dcoutts: ah I see, it renders via cairo...
06:47:09 <poetix> So if in the end I discard the wrapper, I can still steal the ideas
06:47:13 <dcoutts> xerox, yes
06:47:40 <poetix> And maybe look at compatibility with gobby also, whichever way it goes
06:47:43 <musasabi> shapr: I think some version does - although here it says "convert: NoImageVectorGraphics (foo.svg)."
06:47:43 <vikasg> boegel, none of the logos have the appropriate level of fuzziness, don't you think ? :)
06:48:07 <boegel> vikasg: fuzziness ? why should they be fuzzy ?
06:48:28 <boegel> vikasg: you should move this discussion to #haskell-blah :)
06:53:36 * Sigsegv__ back
06:53:51 <Sigsegv__> Hi
06:55:37 <boegel> Hi Sigsegv__
06:56:16 <Sigsegv__> exists a typclass for lists?
06:56:35 <basti_> uhm
06:56:36 <basti_> yes
06:56:43 <Sigsegv__> i want to implement a special variant of a list alike type
06:56:44 <basti_> basically
06:56:51 <basti_> its not a class though
06:56:56 <basti_> not in the haskell sense
06:57:05 <basti_> you can do that with data
06:57:24 <basti_> data MyList = MyCons a (MyList a) | MyNil
06:57:27 <Sigsegv__> wait, i tell you my idea and you solve it :-)
06:57:32 <basti_> pff
06:57:35 <basti_> is this a homework problem? ;)
06:57:45 <Sigsegv__> no, its my own problem
06:57:56 <basti_> okay
06:57:59 <Sigsegv__> i want to solve 8 queens nicely
06:57:59 <basti_> lets talk about it ;)
06:58:17 * basti_ nodnods
06:58:37 <Sigsegv__> when using cons (:) i want just to add the "right" elements.
06:58:59 <dcoutts> Cale, I've found the cause of the bug, but don't know why it's happending yet
06:59:13 <Sigsegv__> and the constraints for the problem should be tested to the new element
06:59:21 <basti_> hmmok
06:59:28 <basti_> why do you think you need a special type for that?
06:59:51 <Sigsegv__> ok, in opal i would overload :: which is :
07:00:23 <Sigsegv__> and then check the elements for correctnis.
07:00:33 <basti_> you mean, inside the cons operation, so that you can not cons together a faulty list?
07:00:55 <Sigsegv__> basti_, right! :-)
07:01:04 <basti_> hummh
07:01:43 <basti_> well, first: typeclasses in haskell are different than in most other languages
07:01:51 <Sigsegv__> since i can only overload functions from a typeclass, i thought there must be a class for listts
07:02:00 <SamB> what do you mean, different than in most other languages?
07:02:00 <basti_> "list" is not a class for example, its a functor
07:02:07 <SamB> what other languages have typeclasses?
07:02:12 <basti_> SamB: see ;)
07:02:19 * SamB stares greedily
07:02:48 <Sigsegv__> basti_, i could not a found a typeclass for lists, so how do i overload cons?
07:02:58 <basti_> Sigsegv__: basically "list" is just a type with an argument
07:03:09 <basti_> lists are lists of "something"
07:03:21 <basti_> so in that sense, you can't "overload cons"
07:03:38 <xerox> Functors!
07:03:40 <Sigsegv__> basti_, well i know that, i know there should be a "induzierte signature"
07:03:45 <basti_> you can't bind any np-complete activity to building lists too.
07:04:01 <xerox> basti_: what does it mean?
07:04:08 <Sigsegv__> what is np-complete?
07:04:13 <basti_> "computation"
07:04:17 <basti_> a function
07:04:25 <basti_> you can't bind a function to cons directly
07:04:44 <SamB> foldr them, if you want to replace cons!
07:04:46 <basti_> you could make a function that checks if a certain cons is valid and executes it only if, but thats not the same imo
07:05:15 <Sigsegv__> basti_, right, that was my first implementation in opal too,
07:05:21 <basti_> foldr is a generic function that does "replace all conses with X and nil with Y"
07:05:47 <Sigsegv__> basti_, so the realy nice variant is to write a new pseusdo cons which checks the constraints.
07:05:52 <Lemmih> Hurrah for GHC 6.4.1!
07:05:53 <Sigsegv__> basti_, richt?
07:06:00 <basti_> yes right
07:06:06 <Sigsegv__> basti_, sorry right
07:06:09 <basti_> you certianly can't do it "at the type level"
07:06:13 <SamB> alternatively, you could try filter
07:06:18 <basti_> you could disguise that maybe.
07:06:27 <basti_> and make it look similar to :
07:06:33 <Sigsegv__> basti_, disguise?
07:06:37 <basti_> after all, : is just an infix data constructor
07:06:41 <basti_> you can declare infix functions too
07:07:01 <basti_> theres nothing special about :
07:07:17 <basti_> @eval 4 `compare` 17
07:07:20 <Lemmih> dcoutts: The Wiki says that the hIDE repo also contains the yi/hide integration work.
07:07:22 <boegel> ghc 6.4.1 announce, w00!
07:07:24 <lambdabot> LT
07:07:35 <basti_> with `function` every function can be infix
07:07:39 <basti_> just as (:) is prefix
07:07:41 <Sigsegv__> basti_, writing my own infix function.
07:08:03 <basti_> and then, functions with only "operator like" characters are infix by default iirc
07:08:13 <Sigsegv__> basti_, can i name it (:::)?
07:08:17 <basti_> yes
07:08:31 <basti_> even without the ()
07:08:47 <basti_> the () are just necissary if you want to curry some infix operation
07:09:06 <Sigsegv__> basti_, just because of beeing named with noalphanumerics
07:09:10 <basti_> (or if you want to take the function as an argument, which comes out as equal)
07:09:20 <basti_> i'd have to look up the rules
07:09:41 <Sigsegv__> basti_, thats enough, thanks a lot basti_
07:09:56 <pejo> Out of curiosity - how is embedding the conditions inside of ::: better than having an explicit test and then : it?
07:09:58 <Sigsegv__> basti_, i will try that first, thanks
07:10:01 <ndm> you can't write ::: as an infix function
07:10:11 <basti_> you can't? why not?
07:10:15 <basti_> is it taken?
07:10:15 <ndm> any infix function starting with : is a constructor
07:10:18 <basti_> ohhh
07:10:23 <basti_> i didn't know that!
07:10:28 <Sigsegv__> ndm: mist
07:10:32 <ndm> hence :+ etc for rationals
07:10:41 <basti_> ah i see
07:10:46 <basti_> Sigsegv__: so why dont you use <:>
07:11:01 <basti_> or -:-
07:11:06 <Sigsegv__> basti_, so i will use this name,
07:11:12 <xerox> Isn't it "." ?
07:11:25 <basti_> "."?
07:11:26 <xerox> Like .and. .+. etc
07:11:29 <basti_> oh
07:12:08 <Sigsegv__> pejo: right after adding an element i can check the constraints for the list elements.
07:12:34 <Sigsegv__> pejo: its just mostly the position in code. or maybe the better understanding
07:13:15 <dcoutts> Lemmih, oh yes, we're still talking about that
07:13:36 <dcoutts> Lemmih, it's not quite worked out how the code will split across the yi & hIDE repos
07:13:58 <dcoutts> Lemmih, your opinion?
07:16:24 <vegai> freenode frightens me
07:16:45 <basti_> why?
07:16:57 <Lemmih> dcoutts: dons moved the code to a separate repo so I guess it's already decided.
07:17:16 <shapr> vegai: how so?
07:17:21 <vegai> with all their non-spamming methods
07:17:58 <Muad_Dibber> it doesnt frighten me
07:18:00 <dcoutts> Lemmih, thought where the code that knows about both yi and hIDE will goes is not decided
07:18:04 <Muad_Dibber> it strikes me as a good thing vegai :)
07:18:42 <Lemmih> dcoutts: It will of course go in the hIDE repo. Shouldn't be more than a couple of lines anyway.
07:18:48 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I think the rough concensus was that while the gtk front end may go in the yi repo, bits which need to know about hIDE should go in a wrapper layer in a plugin in the hIDE repo
07:18:51 <dcoutts> Lemmih, indeed
07:19:03 <vegai> Muad_Dibber: what about denying PM for non-identified people?
07:19:09 * vegai shrugs.
07:19:21 <vegai> seems rather extreme to me, that's all. I've never seen any spam on freenode before anyway
07:19:27 <Muad_Dibber> vegai: i have
07:19:31 <vegai> ok then.
07:19:31 <Muad_Dibber> and it's getting worse
07:19:35 <Muad_Dibber> not only here, but everywhere
07:19:41 <Muad_Dibber> and besides, you can turn it off if you want to right? :)
07:19:47 <Lemmih> dons has removed a lot of the code the Emacs keymap needed *sigh*
07:20:28 <vegai> sure.

07:35:07 * boegel wonders if CosmicRay will be on time tomorrow with HWN
07:35:12 <boegel> @seen CosmicRay
07:35:13 <lambdabot> CosmicRay is in #haskell. I don't know when CosmicRay last spoke.
07:39:47 <dcoutts> Cale, I've fixed your bug, it was an obscure Gtk+ bug that Gtk2Hs triggered
07:40:22 <xerox> dcoutts: which one?
07:41:02 <dcoutts> xerox, Cale was having a problem where attaching a delete handler to a window was blocking other events on that window
07:41:11 <dcoutts> xerox, http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=316702
07:41:36 <CosmicRay> boegel: yes ;-)
07:41:43 <xerox> !!
07:41:45 <xerox> Got it.
07:41:51 <boegel> CosmicRay: w00 ! working on it already ?
07:42:00 <dcoutts> xerox, so I've added a workaround to Gtk2Hs so it doesn't unset all events for the window
07:42:00 <CosmicRay> boegel: not yet
07:42:21 <boegel> CosmicRay: but it won't be Wed this week ? ;)
07:42:27 <CosmicRay> not this week
07:42:36 <dcoutts> xerox, the workaround is just to add: widgetAddEvents self [] = return ()
07:42:37 <CosmicRay> next week maybe, I'll be at a conference with questionable Internet access
07:42:45 <CosmicRay> after that it should be on time for quite some time ;-)
07:48:08 <xerox> dcoutts: I see.
07:50:11 * dcoutts notes that GHC 6.4.1 has just been released

07:56:20 <dcoutts> @where yi+gtk
07:56:21 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/yi+gtk
07:57:02 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so we don't need yiBase? but we'll need some plugin to actually connect up the yi gtk UI with the ideShell
07:57:22 <CosmicRay> boegel: thanks!
07:57:57 <boegel> CosmicRay: I think you should leather-bind the first ten issues, I'll be your first customer ;)
07:58:04 <CosmicRay> hehe
07:58:20 <CosmicRay> I can see it now... "Professionally printed in handsome Courier..."
07:58:29 <boegel> hehe :)
07:58:38 <humasect_> o_o

09:22:38 <dcoutts> Lemmih, we should get this building again using the yi+gtk version
09:25:17 <musasabi> jhc has now been building base package for 1.5 hours - maybe I should just head home...
09:44:10 <Lemmih> Hi SyntaxNinja.

09:52:29 <SyntaxNinja> hi dcoutts, Lemmih.
09:54:32 <Igloo> Yo Syn! What's the right way to tell cabal it should include certain files when making a source dist and otherwise ignore them?
09:57:53 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: hm. I think we added a field for that.
09:59:05 * Igloo couldn't see one on http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/authors.html
09:59:06 <Akshaal> SyntaxNinja: Hi, did you see patch for cabal (buildinfo fix) in your mail?
09:59:45 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: I think it's extraSrcFiles or something: http://haskell.org/cabal/release/rc/doc/API/Distribution.PackageDescription.html#v%3AextraSrcFiles
10:00:09 <SyntaxNinja> Akshaal: I saw that, but haven't got around to checking it out yet.  A bit busy here, but I'll try to do it before i leave for ICFP on wednesday.
10:00:14 <SyntaxNinja> Akshaal: thanks so much for the patch!
10:00:44 <Igloo> OK, ta
10:01:18 <SyntaxNinja> The files placed in this distribution are the package         description file, the setup script, the sources of the modules         named in the package description file, and files named in the         license-file, main-is,         c-sources and extra-source-files         fields.
10:03:05 <Akshaal> SyntaxNinja: no problem, just ensuring that mail did not lost :)

11:30:22 <ignas> nice
11:30:30 <shapr> ignas: Now that you've had the whirlwind tour, Do you have any specific questions? Want to see some cool lambdabot tricks?
11:31:03 <ignas> does lambdabot has a personality ?
11:31:11 <SyntaxNinja> ignas: sometimes
11:31:13 <ignas> :/ broken english

11:31:40 <ignas> lambdabot, are you a bot ?
11:31:45 <psi> @vixen you have a nice personality
11:31:46 <lambdabot> you're nice too
11:32:09 <ignas> what is the defacto IDE for haskel
11:32:16 <ignas> linux/ubntu here ...
11:32:30 <CosmicRay> ignas: emacs, unless you prefer vi. ;-)
11:32:35 <shapr> I use emacs on Debian.
11:32:46 <ignas> i see ...
11:33:00 <ignas> are there haskel implementations that have a lisp like REPL ?
11:33:03 <musasabi> Is the JFP september issue's compiler article available somewhere for free?
11:33:04 <CosmicRay> ignas: what do you use for your python/lisp work?
11:33:16 <ignas> CosmicRay, emacs and emacs :)
11:33:27 <musasabi> ignas: hugs and ghci inside emacs.
11:33:31 <CosmicRay> ignas: by "repl", you're looking for a simple interpreter?
11:33:44 <CosmicRay> ignas: hugs and ghci (part of the ghc package) provide haskell interpreters
11:33:50 <CosmicRay> ghci has more features, hugs is more portable.
11:33:57 <ignas> no, i am looking for interactive modification of a running program
11:34:12 <musasabi> (We have a paper copy at the department but the library will be open only in the morning...)
11:34:17 <CosmicRay> ignas: ah, for that you would probably be looking for hs-plugins
11:34:34 <ignas> plugins ?
11:34:44 <CosmicRay> ignas: you can't actually modify haskell programs while they run, though you can (with the interpreter) reload source files during your session
11:35:00 <CosmicRay> most of the time, you compile haskell to native machine code
11:35:02 * zooko clicks on "ImperativeHaskell".
11:35:32 <zooko> I was just telling my wife in the shower this morning that darcs's problems flow from Haskell's declarivist paradigm.
11:35:33 <ignas> CosmicRay, well - most of the time you compile lisp code to native machine code too ...
11:35:41 <zooko> One's greatest strength is always one's greatest weakness.
11:35:48 <zooko> Comic books taught me that.
11:35:55 <zooko> Maybe the part about the shower was Too Much Information,.
11:35:59 <CosmicRay> zooko: damn you, spinach! ;-)
11:36:05 <shapr> I dunno, I always get my best ideas in the shower.
11:36:19 <CosmicRay> zooko: that depends entirely on how many people were in the shower at the time.
11:36:37 * shapr doesn't want to know!
11:36:39 <zooko> CosmicRay: 3
11:37:00 <CosmicRay> that most certainly *was* too much information ;-)
11:37:02 <zooko> One of them is 13 months old.
11:37:08 <zooko> Okay, I'll stop talking about my personal life.  :-)
11:37:13 * shapr grins
11:37:26 <shapr> Watch out or I'll tell you about my personal life. That'll clear the channel fast.
11:37:33 <thebug> haha
11:37:50 <ignas> where can i get ghci, hugs and apropriate emacs modes ?
11:37:50 <Muad_Dibber> #haskell-blah
11:38:33 <musasabi> ignas: if you are using linux then with your distribution otherwise from haskell.org
11:38:44 <shapr> ignas: apt-get install haskell-mode hugs ghc
11:38:47 <CosmicRay> ignas: apt-get install ghc6 hugs haskell-mode
11:38:58 <ignas> CosmicRay, CVS emacs ...
11:39:29 <SyntaxNinja> "ideas"
11:39:45 <Igloo> SyntaxNinja: ?
11:40:19 <CosmicRay> Igloo: oh, so you want the url for the source to haskell-mode?  just a sec
11:40:39 <CosmicRay> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellMode?action=highlight&value=emacs
11:40:46 <CosmicRay> http://www.haskell.org/haskell-mode/
11:40:48 * Igloo slaps CosmicRay with a tomato
11:40:57 <CosmicRay> err s/Igloo/ignas/
11:41:13 * CosmicRay catches the fully ripe tomato and takes a bite out of it.  yum.
11:41:50 <ignas> CosmicRay, thank you
11:46:17 * shapr boings cheerfully
11:52:22 <CosmicRay> shapr: you were asking about odbc on unix.
11:52:49 <shapr> Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to get SQLRelay to talk to freetds.
11:53:05 <basti_> shapr: do you think it would be wise ignoring all hsp & hswebforms framework stuff and just build my own cgi interface?
11:54:17 <CosmicRay> oh fun.
11:54:21 <basti_> wise to ignore
11:54:37 <CosmicRay> the hsp stuff sounds pretty cool
11:54:46 <CosmicRay> shapr: I've never worked with either of those though ;-(
11:54:46 <basti_> hsp looks really good
11:54:54 <basti_> the server sucks, though, from what i've heard.
11:55:01 <shapr> basti_: I'd recommend trying hsp & hswebforms first.
11:55:01 <CosmicRay> but if you need info on setting up unixodbc, I can help
11:55:10 <shapr> Yes!
11:55:28 <shapr> hiya lelit! How's code?
11:55:44 <basti_> shapr: hsp is running fine, but i don't understand how the cgi stuff is supposed to work.
11:55:48 <CosmicRay> shapr: first, install unixodbc-bin
11:55:58 <shapr> CosmicRay: I'm on a SuSE 9 box...
11:56:05 <CosmicRay> ODBCConfig is the closest it comes to having a nice setup tool.
11:56:06 <CosmicRay> oh.
11:56:06 <lelit> hi shapr
11:56:10 <CosmicRay> do you have ODBCConfig?
11:56:16 <shapr> yeah?
11:56:24 <shapr> What does it do?
11:56:42 <CosmicRay> configures your data sources (which are the databases that you can connect to)
11:56:45 <shapr> hm
11:57:16 <CosmicRay> you have to do that before you can connect to anything with odbc
11:57:36 <CosmicRay> http://www.unixodbc.org/config.html
11:57:53 <CosmicRay> there's also http://www.unixodbc.org/doc/
11:58:04 <shapr> I've been fiddling with my odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini for hours, without progress.
11:58:04 <CosmicRay> I assume you're using unixODBC?
11:58:06 <shapr> yup
11:58:19 <CosmicRay> ODBCConfig basically sets those up for you.
11:58:30 <CosmicRay> you're pointing to sqlrelay, instead of a standard database, I take it?
11:58:59 <CosmicRay> The "neophyte's guide" on that doc page may help you
11:59:38 <CosmicRay> http://www.unixodbc.org/odbcinst.html also
12:01:33 <shapr> I can get isql to talk to the SQL Server just fine via DSN, but ZSQLRelay won't.
12:01:46 <CosmicRay> oh.
12:01:50 <CosmicRay> well then your odbc is working.
12:01:59 <shapr> But SQLRelay isn't talking to it.
12:02:08 <CosmicRay> what does it say?
12:02:30 <shapr> Nothing at all, it just never comes back
12:02:32 <CosmicRay> the only thing that occurs to me immediately is that your own user account might be finding your ini files, but maybe ZSQLRelay isn't, due to a different cwd or home dir.
12:02:36 <CosmicRay> freaky.
12:02:52 <CosmicRay> tried stracing it?
12:02:55 <shapr> hm, no
12:03:01 <shapr> Good idea!
12:03:16 <CosmicRay> I love strace.
12:07:24 <SyntaxNinja> strace!
12:07:41 <SyntaxNinja> the program that really gives you TMI (until it doesn't give you enough)
12:08:19 <CosmicRay> heh
12:08:32 <Wilmer> that's one of the nicest descriptions of strace i've ever read ;-)
12:08:43 <Wilmer> but it's still so damn useful
12:09:19 <prionic> question concerning hsp: is it possible to use hsp without hspr?
12:24:25 <shapr> CosmicRay: it works!
12:24:47 <CosmicRay> shapr: woot, what was the problem?
12:25:21 <shapr> CosmicRay: The list is too long to enumerate.
12:25:41 <CosmicRay> heh
12:26:05 <shapr> I started with freetds, switched to odbc, had to remove leftover shm segments and semaphores, etc
12:26:13 <CosmicRay> ugh.
12:26:26 <CosmicRay> I haven't had to toy with the ipcs command in ages.
12:26:32 <basti_> prionic: yes, by running the stuff as cgi
12:29:27 <ibid> stopped talking pirate already? :)
12:29:38 <xerox> @arr
12:29:39 <lambdabot> Drink up, me hearties
12:30:09 <prionic> basti_: is there sample code?
12:30:10 <ibid> gaah
12:30:28 <basti_> prionic: doing something sensible or not? ;)
12:30:48 <prionic> basti_: ?
12:31:08 <basti_> there is an example called login somewhere which you can build as a standalone program
12:31:12 <basti_> let me find it
12:31:19 <xerox> I want me grog!
12:31:46 <basti_> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/hswebforms/hswebforms/examples/ there
12:31:59 <basti_> this is about "hswebforms" strictly speaking, but you can safely strip the form
12:32:23 <prionic> basti_: thx a lot, ill take a look right away
12:32:28 <basti_> its the hsp equivalent of "hello world", that was what i was referring to
12:32:39 * ibid shamelessly plugs https://sourceforge.net/projects/tautau/ , a program that grew from a course project in my fp course
12:34:30 <SyntaxNinja> my work team is going to this place for "pirate cooking": http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/37944348/portland_or/salvador_molly_s.html?cslink=roundup_name_cust&ulink=roundup__roundupentity1-2_1__0_profile_2_1
12:38:29 <Igloo> ibid: Bah, want pretty pictures!
12:48:48 <musasabi> malcolm: Would you happen to know a working mirror for ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/pub/malcolm/ismm98.html ?
12:49:13 <malcolm> hmm, what the problem?
12:49:38 <ibid> Igloo: http://www.mit.jyu.fi/ji/tautau/tankki1.png
12:49:49 <ibid> http://www.mit.jyu.fi/ji/tautau/tankki2.png
12:50:19 <Igloo> Hi malcolm  :-)
12:50:33 <malcolm> Hi igloo
12:50:35 <Igloo> ibid: Cool, ta
12:50:57 <musasabi> For some reason I cannot get it to work (I think it is ftp + firewall related)
12:52:08 <malcolm> musasabi: There are occasional difficulties with our FTP server - someone a while ago worked out that it is our main campus firewall blocking certain ports.
12:52:17 <Lunar^_> SyntaxNinja: when is ICFP starting?
12:52:41 <malcolm> musasabi: I think the solution is for the remote user to switch off (or on, I can't remember) passive mode.
12:53:28 <ibid> Igloo: 22:41 @<Batalyx> my pleasure
12:53:28 <malcolm> musasabi: but maybe you would just like me to email you a copy of the paper?  :-)
12:54:44 <musasabi> malcolm: that could be nice if it is no bother to you - ekarttun at cs helsinki fi.
12:56:55 <Igloo> Lunar^_: http://www.cs.ioc.ee/tfp-icfp-gpce05/ has a timetable
12:58:15 <malcolm> musasabi: you have mail.
13:06:05 <musasabi> thanks
13:49:36 <alar> hello
13:50:00 <alar> I have syntax question:
13:50:21 <alar> one cant construct datatype with named fields
13:50:40 <alar> e.g. Pt (pointx,pointy::Float)
13:50:51 <musasabi> like data Foo = Foo { bar :: Int, baz :: Double } ?
13:51:00 <alar> exactly
13:51:08 <alar> cant->can
13:51:29 <alar> is it possible to construct type synonim with named fields
13:51:34 <alar> ?
13:51:49 <musasabi> no - that would make no sense.
13:51:57 <alar> why?
13:52:05 <Heffalump> newtype lets you use a named field
13:52:17 <musasabi> alar: can you name an example where it would make sense for "type".
13:52:28 <Heffalump> but you only get one field total
13:52:50 <musasabi> with newtype MyType = Wrap { unWrap :: InnerType }
13:53:10 <cribs> just installed hugs on fedora core, seemed to works smoothly but i cant load it now
13:53:41 <alar> musasabi anywhere where "data" would but constructor is not necessary
13:54:10 <alar> e.g. type Point=(pointx::Float,pointy::Float)
13:54:28 <sylvan> just define pointx = fst, pointy = snd =)
13:54:40 <alar> =))
13:55:46 <sylvan> Seriously though, just define explicit functions to extract the tuple-element you need
13:56:32 <alar> sylvan and other explicit function to substitute new tuple-element?
13:57:21 <alar> if I have 3 5-multiple types, that would make 30 helper functions )
13:57:25 <alar> :0
13:57:40 <musasabi> alar: you can derive getter/setter functions with drift.
13:57:52 <musasabi> but usually just using data is the best approach.
13:57:53 <alar> what is drift?
13:58:54 <alar> musasabi without named fields data constructor just complicates
13:59:05 <alar> but with them using data maybe ok
14:08:39 * shapr yawns
14:09:13 <shapr> greetings astrolabe
14:09:27 <astrolabe> Hia shapr.  How's things?
14:09:35 <shapr> Code is good, how's things with you?
14:09:53 <astrolabe> Code is stalled.  Other things are ok thanks
14:10:36 * dcoutts has just got his first "hello world" custom GtkTreeModel implementation working
14:11:04 <shapr> Does gtk2hs use Cabal to install?
14:11:10 <dcoutts> shapr, not yet
14:11:24 <dcoutts> when cabal supports some more stuff, I'll give it a go
14:11:28 <astrolabe> I just stumbled across an interesting site: http://www.algds.org/
14:12:02 <dcoutts> shapr, Gtk2Hs has 3 base packages and 5 optional packages, cabal doesn't really support that yet nicely
14:12:09 <shapr> Ah, too bad.
14:12:13 <dcoutts> indeed
14:12:36 <dcoutts> shapr, but if you send patches to SyntaxNinja then maybe it will :-)

15:03:18 <asmodai> shapr: btw
15:03:26 <asmodai> shapr: at least I use python and not perl ;)
15:03:35 <basti_> if youre using perl6, thats good again.
15:03:48 <basti_> as long as you dont say its a good language.
15:03:52 <asmodai> heh
15:03:56 <asmodai> ruby and python baby
15:04:05 * asmodai flips the bird (a parrot?) at perl
15:05:18 <musasabi> pugs eats parrots for breakfast ;)
15:06:13 <basti_> but it drops functors
15:09:42 <xerox> Goodnight folks.
15:11:11 <asmodai> musasabi: pugs?
15:21:29 <musasabi> asmodai: perl6 implemented in haskell - http://pugscode.org/
15:22:06 <asmodai> o_O
15:22:14 <asmodai> People have nothing better to do? ;)
15:22:21 <shapr> asmodai: So, when do you want to learn Haskell? It's so lovely!
15:22:34 <shapr> Haskell is good for implementing languages.
15:22:41 <musasabi> Is there a good way of detecting where a Haskell app gets stuck in a loop (or rather infinite recursion which just eats cpu) ?
15:23:22 <shapr> I've heard ndm talk about black-hat for detecting black holes.
15:23:54 <asmodai> shapr: it is on my list
15:24:02 <Lunar^_> Igloo: thanks
15:24:41 <musasabi> shapr: This uses multiparameter classes quite a lot so hat might have problems with that.
15:24:49 <shapr> Probably so.
15:25:06 <musasabi> and since it gets stuck the ghc profiler won't write out the profile.
15:27:30 <shapr> Maybe Debug.QuickCheck.Batch?
15:28:56 <musasabi> shapr: I am trying to avoid understanding all the code and the correct output for a given input is nontrivial (I am trying to solve some problems with more unfamiliar parts of jhc)
15:29:10 <shapr> oh
15:29:56 <shapr> Hack the profiler to write out checkpoint statistics?
15:31:41 <musasabi> Hack the compiler to hack the compiler sounds a little bit heavy for fun.
15:32:03 * shapr grins
15:33:30 <musasabi> The code just is too non-linear to make manual debug traces very useful.
15:33:51 <musasabi> that is many bodies for each function.
15:34:03 <shapr> I don't have any good suggestions.
15:34:56 <shapr> I think that writing unit tests is like building a road in front of me so I can drive faster while building roads. Or something like that.
15:35:32 <musasabi> shapr: but how does one unit-test an optimizer?
15:36:17 <Lemmih> The profiling will still write out the profile if you terminate the program with C-c.
15:36:17 <shapr> Well, you can unit test it for correctness, but I'm not sure how to test efficiency.
15:36:27 <musasabi> because the problems will be caused by nontrivial input (which is usually large) and the correct (large) result does vary by each revision of the algorithm.
15:36:46 <musasabi> JFP has something on this in the september issue I think.
15:36:55 <musasabi> Lemmih: thanks I'll try that.
15:37:11 <shapr> The shrink code from QuickCheck2 could help you find bugs in nontrivial inputs.
15:37:40 * shapr tries to think of a good way to test optimization.
15:37:55 <Heffalump> nullspace tests are really effective
15:38:54 <shapr> If ghc's profiling code could take a function definition and test input, and return profile statistics, you could automate some optimization testing.
15:39:44 <Igloo> You can already do that, with a little bit of driver code
15:40:20 <Heffalump> does profiling give you some figure that increases monotonically (not necessarily linearly) with time taken?
15:41:12 <Igloo> Err, time taken?
15:41:13 <musasabi> I'll compile it with -profiling and let it get stuck for the night. In the morning after C-C it should be quite obvious where it was stuck.
15:41:21 <musasabi> => sleep
15:41:42 <Heffalump> yes, runtime
15:42:04 <Igloo> I'm not asking for clarification, I'm suggesting an answer
15:42:22 <Igloo> I assume I'm also misunderstanding the question, though
15:42:40 <Heffalump> ah.
15:42:56 <Heffalump> what's the point in using the profiling code, then?
15:43:49 <Igloo> No idea. Using it will also mean your program is differently optimised
15:43:58 <Heffalump> yeah
15:51:21 <shapr> hoi Jan_w, long time no see
15:51:57 <Jan_w> hi shapr: indeed
15:52:19 <Jan_w> i've finished my study and i've been working :)
15:52:30 <shapr> Neat, how's the job?
15:52:41 <Jan_w> Great!, i LOVE it :)
15:52:51 <Jan_w> I get to hack all day :)
15:53:21 <Jan_w> but unfortunately not in haskel
15:53:27 <Jan_w> so I'll that as a hobby
15:53:37 <Jan_w> (keep) missing there :)
15:54:21 <neadjneki> you mean hacking? ;)
15:55:15 <shapr> Programming is definitely my job of choice.
15:55:18 <Jan_w> well, i write embedded software for product we (our company) make
15:56:02 <Jan_w> its mostly c but I can still amaze my collegues with my python as haskel programs :)
15:56:19 <Jan_w> do so much with so little :)
15:57:40 <Jan_w> it fun to see self-proclaimed experts ("I can read pretty much any language" kind of guys) try to twist their mind around haskel :)
15:57:46 <Igloo> Hmm, curious. My BarelyHaskell is slower than my Haskell in ghc 6.4.1
15:58:21 <shapr> Jan_w: cool!
15:58:21 <neadjneki> ne Jan_w:ozz!
15:58:39 <Heffalump> Igloo: you're what?
15:58:42 <Heffalump> s/you're/your/
15:59:09 <Jan_w> any of you python lovers too ?
15:59:22 <shapr> I loved Python before I found Haskell.
15:59:22 <Heffalump> Jan_w: what kind of embedded software, OOI?
15:59:22 <neadjneki> ne Jan_w:ozz!
15:59:34 <Jan_w> ozz ?:)
15:59:56 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/bench/bench-0.1/Tests/Ptr/FindSpace/BarelyHaskell.hs is slower than http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/bench/bench-0.1/Tests/Ptr/FindSpace/Haskell.hs
16:00:10 <Jan_w> Heffalump: LPC 2xxx mainlu
16:00:36 <Jan_w> Heffalump: arm7
16:01:54 <Jan_w> shapr: how is your python ? how can I include a variable in a raw string ? re.search(r'/' + filename + r'/', cvsfile) does not interpret filename as raw
16:01:58 <Jan_w> ;)
16:02:44 <Heffalump> Jan_w: ah, do you work for Philips?
16:03:05 <Heffalump> (/me works for ARM)
16:03:07 <Jan_w> Heffalump: well, I live in Eindhoven, but no not directly :)
16:03:27 <shapr> Jan_w: works for me.
16:03:44 <shapr> Jan_w: Or do you mean you want the filename escaped for regex purposes?
16:03:48 * Heffalump really should look at the GHC ARM situation properly
16:04:06 <Jan_w> shapr: yes, it works but not if your filename is "foo-c++.c"
16:04:17 <shapr> Jan_w: use the re.escape function.
16:04:23 <Jan_w> shapr: yes :)
16:04:25 <Jan_w> thanks
16:04:48 <shapr> Whenever you have a bit of trouble with a python module, try dir(modulename)
16:04:57 <shapr> so like, "import re" and then "dir(re)"
16:05:08 <Heffalump> it'd be cool if high-level languages could be used to generate good embedded code
16:05:49 <shapr> Jan_w: Here's my cool Jython screenshot - http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/nokia-emu-jython.png That's a Nokia 9210 emulator.
16:05:51 <Jan_w> yes, it would!
16:06:39 <Jan_w> shapr: wow
16:07:14 <Jan_w> shapr: you must tell me about it later!, my script now works, so I can now sleep easy :)
16:07:22 <shapr> ok, good night!
16:07:28 <Jan_w> see you all soon! and good night@
16:15:41 <ricebowl> hallo, I'm trying to create a custom datatype of any sort of number (i.e. Integer or Float or Double), but I can't seem to figure out how to do that
16:17:01 <Lemmih> @pl \e -> f c e >> return True
16:17:02 <lambdabot> (>> return True) . f c
16:17:46 <ricebowl> ?
16:18:07 <Lemmih> It wasn't related to your problem.
16:18:17 <ricebowl> I was supposing not
16:18:47 <Lemmih> So you want a data type with a single member which must be an instance of Num?
16:20:31 <ricebowl> no, two members
16:20:35 <ricebowl> but right, they should be Num
16:20:39 <ricebowl> and that doesn't seem to work
16:20:47 <ricebowl> I tried type Point = (Num, Num)
16:21:12 <ricebowl> ERROR "assignment1.hsk":1 - Undefined type constructor "Num"
16:23:54 <Lemmih> type Pair a = (a,a)?
16:24:10 <dons> moin
16:24:14 <Lemmih> Hi dons.
16:24:19 <ricebowl> I'll try it
16:24:21 <dons> how's code Lemmih?
16:24:45 <Lemmih> dons: Good. Been hacking on yi+gtk for a while.
16:24:49 <dons> oh, 07:19:47 <Lemmih> dons has removed a lot of the code the Emacs keymap needed *sigh*
16:24:53 * dcoutts was just about to ask the same question
16:24:55 <dons> sorry!
16:25:06 <Lemmih> Added emacs support.
16:25:19 <dcoutts> so where is the yi+gtk repo now?
16:25:31 <dcoutts> is it on shapr's server?
16:25:57 <dons> if not we should put it there
16:26:19 <dons> Lemmih, you extended Keymap/Emacs.hs?
16:26:26 <dons> or filled out more of Core.hs
16:26:52 <dcoutts> I've been hacking on the ide shell, doing some gtk2hs bits necessary to to tree views easily using a model implemented in Haskell
16:27:04 <dons> also, since I'll be in Estonia from Friday, we should make sure the repo is writeable for you guys, as my devel opportunties will be limited
16:27:14 <shapr> Need a repo symlinked before I go to sleep?
16:27:18 <dcoutts> dons, right
16:27:25 <Lemmih> dons: Added Emacs2 files and made some small changes to Core.hs
16:27:28 <dcoutts> shapr, that'd be handy
16:27:33 <dons> oh, you don't like Emacs.hs ?
16:27:49 <dons> if was hoping to have a grand unified emacs implementation this time
16:27:54 <dcoutts> Lemmih, where is the yi+gtk repo then? we should copy it over to shapr's machine
16:28:03 <Igloo> No, you need one per emacs user
16:28:09 <Igloo> Just like ni the traditional unix world
16:28:12 <Lemmih> Emacs.hs == emacs more with no emacs-like features ?
16:28:16 <tmccort> I'm going to start learning haskell soon so what's the best implementation of it right now?
16:28:25 <dcoutts> tmccort, ghc
16:28:36 <dcoutts> @where ghc
16:28:37 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc
16:29:01 * Igloo stands awkwardly in front of a pile of vi clones. Nothing to see here  :-)
16:29:14 <dons> Lemmih? hmm. perhaps some of them aren't enabled. what features were missing? (besides the key bindings that are down due to lack of support in Core.hs)
16:29:34 <dons> where does the hide repo live now?
16:29:37 <tmccort> thanks
16:29:59 <dcoutts> http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hIDE/
16:30:03 <dons> we should darcs get yi+gtk to the same spot. rename it to yi, and then Lemmih can merge in his patches
16:30:10 <Lemmih> dons: I haven't looked into it. Emacs2.hs just feels better.
16:30:26 <dons> ok ok.
16:30:27 <dcoutts> dons, which is in /home/hide/public_html/hIDE on the server
16:30:41 <dons> dcoutts, i'll put yi there now
16:30:44 <dcoutts> so I suggest: /home/hide/public_html/yi+gtk/
16:30:51 <dons> can i just call it yi?
16:30:55 <dcoutts> sure
16:31:00 <dcoutts> oh wait, hmm
16:31:15 <tmccort> When will there be a windows binary for the new GHC release? Anyone know?
16:31:16 <dcoutts> there's alreay a yi mirror on http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/
16:31:38 <dons> ah true, old yi. ok, I'll call it yi-core for now
16:31:43 <dcoutts> ok
16:32:08 <shapr> Or I can whack the old yi repo
16:32:09 <dcoutts> then we ask shapr to link http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/yi-core to /home/hide/public_html/yi-core/
16:32:50 <dons> shapr, you could whack the old repo, it's still hosted down here, but unlikely to get much more devel activitiy. i'll tar it up as yi-0.1.1
16:32:57 <shapr> ok
16:33:18 <dcoutts> ok then so it's /home/hide/public_html/yi/ and http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/yi/
16:33:25 <dcoutts> shapr, cheers
16:33:31 <dons> ok, yi+gtk (aka yi) is now in /home/hide/public_html/yi/
16:33:44 <dcoutts> great
16:34:05 <shapr> ok, symlinked
16:34:12 <dcoutts> ta muchly shapr
16:34:20 <dons> Lemmih, I'll move your Emacs2.hs back to Emacs.hs, and rename Emacs.hs back to Mg.hs (it was an mg implementation after all)
16:34:45 <dcoutts> and the little bit that loads yi into hIDE and links it into the ideShell, where does that live?
16:35:09 <dons> I think Lemmih probably knows best atm?
16:35:12 <dcoutts> I'm guessing it's in hIDE/plugins/yi-something-or-other
16:35:13 <Lemmih> It should be with the rest of the plugins.
16:35:20 <dcoutts> right good
16:35:22 <dons> yep, plugins/yi-something is best
16:35:35 <tmccort> What's yi?
16:35:46 <dcoutts> @where yi
16:35:46 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi.html
16:36:03 <dons> hmm, maybe lambdabot needs @whatis foo
16:36:16 <dons> @todo-add Implement @whatis
16:36:16 <lambdabot> Entry added to the todo list
16:36:23 <dcoutts> tmccort, it's a text editor written in Haskell, but it's also a test bed for some cool new Haskell technologies
16:36:32 <tmccort> @where lambdabot
16:36:33 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html
16:37:26 <imnowme> whats this channel about
16:37:43 <dcoutts> imnowme, it's about the programming language Haskell
16:37:52 <imnowme> oh
16:37:56 <imnowme> ok
16:38:11 <dcoutts> imnowme, see http://haskell.org/
16:38:26 <imnowme> all right
16:38:45 <ricebowl> blah, why does Hugs barf on this: line :: Point -> Point -> [Num]
16:38:49 * ricebowl is so confused
16:38:53 <dons> shapr, you turned off your script that syncs yi from cse.unsw.edu.au nightly?
16:38:55 <dcoutts> @todo-add implement @cool list, as a clone of the @todo(-add) commands
16:38:55 <lambdabot> Entry added to the todo list
16:38:58 <shapr> dons: yup
16:39:05 <Lemmih> ricebowl: 'Num' is not a type. It's a typeclass.
16:39:08 <tmccort> Cool, the ICFP winner announcement is only a week away.
16:39:20 <ricebowl> what's the difference?
16:39:25 <Lemmih> ricebowl: line :: Num a => Point a -> Point a -> [a]
16:39:26 <dcoutts> tmccort, I guess my team didn't win then :-)
16:39:37 <Lemmih> @learning
16:39:38 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
16:39:39 <ricebowl> curious. What's special about =>?
16:39:48 <dons> dcoutts, neither :} hmm, though it's possible it's a secret..
16:39:49 <dcoutts> dons, you? but of course you'd be sworn to secrecy if you had won so it's no good asking :-)
16:40:03 <dons> no, no contact :/ oh well
16:40:04 <dcoutts> oh the suspense
16:41:40 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so we can nuke the yiBase plugin and replace it with just the Yi/hIDE integration code
16:42:00 <tmccort> dcoutts is you team's entry online?
16:42:23 <dons> oh, we should put our entry online. have to do that after I get back
16:42:27 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Yeah, I'm working on that now.
16:42:44 <dcoutts> tmccort, actually it's not online, we never got round to it
16:42:49 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ok great
16:47:17 <dons> do the scannedinavian.com repos have a darcs.cgi set up? so I can get rss on the repos?
16:48:22 <dcoutts> yes
16:48:32 <dcoutts> oh it does rss does it? nice
16:48:46 <dcoutts> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/hide/
16:49:33 <tmccort> are there binding to sdl?
16:49:39 <tmccort> bindings
16:49:53 <Igloo> I think there's HaSDL somewhere
16:50:30 <dons> dcoutts, http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/hide/?c=rss
16:50:40 <dons> no need for commit mail
16:50:47 <dcoutts> dons, yep just added yi  & hIDE to my rss reader
16:51:40 <dcoutts> sadly is doesn't have the full patch in the body of each article
16:51:55 <Igloo> Bah, you want a push technology for that sort of thing
16:51:58 <dcoutts> or a link to the full patch
16:52:25 <dcoutts> Igloo, but email isn't better since I poll my email
16:52:53 <dons> darcs changes -s format would be ok
16:52:57 <Igloo> Normally not halfway across the 'net, though
16:53:10 <dcoutts> Igloo, true
16:53:13 <dons> that's how my darcs commit-mail wrapper works, but it's kind of heavyweight
16:53:59 <dons> @where hIDE
16:54:00 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/hIDE
16:54:16 <dons> i'll update the links on the wiki
16:54:22 <dcoutts> it's done
16:54:28 <dcoutts> though you could add the Yi bit
16:58:26 <Lemmih> Sourceview got no SetBuffer function?
16:58:49 <dcoutts> it's inherited from the TextView
16:59:00 <dcoutts> textViewSetBuffer
16:59:07 <Lemmih> But it uses a different buffer.
16:59:15 <dcoutts> I don't follow
16:59:22 <Lemmih> (SourceBuffer vs. TextBuffer)
16:59:33 <dcoutts> SourceBuffer inherits from TextBuffer
16:59:47 <dons> oh, reminds me I should the fast construction via CString code you posted yesterday
16:59:51 <dons> should add
17:00:00 <dcoutts> oh yes, that
17:00:02 <Lemmih> Oh neat.
17:01:59 <dons> oh, ghc 6.4.1 is out
17:02:12 * dons continues to use 6.5
17:02:41 * dcoutts is using ghc 6.4.1 already
17:04:17 <Lemmih> dcoutts: There's no castToSourceView?
17:05:42 <dcoutts> Lemmih, oh, quite right
17:06:00 <dcoutts> you'll need to import Graphics.UI.Gtk.SourceView.Types as a temporary worakound
17:06:07 * dcoutts goes to fix that
17:21:55 <tmccort> When would the Windows binary for GHC 6.4.1 come out?
17:25:19 <dcoutts> tmccort, probably within a couple days
17:25:39 <dcoutts> you can use the 6.4 one in the mean time
17:26:52 <dcoutts> yay, my tree view model implemented in Haskell is working, it displays one column with one row containing the string "Yarr!"
17:26:58 <dcoutts> @arr
17:26:59 <lambdabot> This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
17:27:07 <dcoutts> hmm, ok
17:27:39 <dcoutts> Lemmih, the castTo things are in cvs now, the darcs repo will sync by tomorrow morning
17:28:06 * dcoutts intends to make the darcs mirror not lag so much
18:17:33 <prionic> Lemmih: sorry dropped...
18:19:24 <dons> ok, lets see if a darcs push works
18:19:39 * dcoutts holds is breath
18:20:01 <dcoutts> yay? nay?
18:20:25 <dons> it's just a bit slow getting from sydney to sweden
18:20:37 <dcoutts> aye, I bet
18:20:52 <dons> I tweaked your CString code to use PackedString.UTF8 hGet and it's very nice :)
18:21:00 <dcoutts> oh right, nice
18:21:05 <dons> tested up to 1M source files, plenty fast, nice syntax hl
18:21:10 <dcoutts> cool
18:21:30 <dcoutts> so you're not intending to use the SourceView for long
18:21:43 <dcoutts> just until Yi get's its own syntax hl
18:21:48 <dons> I guess we'll write our own version eventually, yes
18:22:06 <dons>   * Add UTF8 packed string construction of GtkBuffers.
18:22:06 <dons> Shall I push this patch? (1/1) [ynWvpxqadjk], or ? for help: y
18:22:07 <dcoutts> then you'll need an interface for applying colours to spans of text
18:22:15 <dons> Finished applying...
18:22:17 <dons> yay!
18:22:31 <dcoutts> so where do we get the PackedString.UTF8 module from?
18:22:40 <dons> from me, or simonM :)
18:22:46 <dons> I'll stick it in darcs in the next day or so
18:22:52 <dcoutts> ok
18:23:06 <dons> oh, it's also in yi now
18:23:13 <dcoutts> ok that's easier
18:23:15 <dcoutts> I'd like to make hIDE a tad easier to build
18:23:22 <dcoutts> I was thinking of a couple things
18:23:47 <dons> yeah, we should try to keep it simple. what ideas have you had?
18:23:48 <dcoutts> 1. a build script to configure build install all the plugins in the right order
18:23:56 <dons> yep. good idea
18:24:12 <dcoutts> 2. modify the loader to be able to use packages from the "--user" package db
18:24:22 <dcoutts> so it can all be done as non-root
18:24:32 <dons> that'd be cool. also for user-written config/extension plugins
18:24:41 <dcoutts> yes
18:24:56 <dcoutts> either that or get them to register into a local package.conf collection
18:25:06 <dcoutts> which might be a better idea longer term anyway
18:25:24 <dcoutts> $HOME/.hIDE/plugins.conf
18:25:53 <dcoutts> but cabal can't register into arbitrary package dbs yet
18:26:13 <dcoutts> @seen SyntaxNinja
18:26:14 <lambdabot> I saw SyntaxNinja leaving #haskell 2 hours, 40 minutes and 40
18:26:14 <lambdabot> seconds ago.
18:26:21 <ptolomy> My assumption that GHC warns me about unmatched pattern cases wasted me about 3 hours today. Stupid me.
18:26:30 <dons> ok, looks like my patch got pushed nicely. good good
18:26:42 <dons> ptolomy, add -Wall -Werror
18:26:45 <dcoutts> ptolomy, it does if you use the right warning flags, eg -Wall
18:26:49 <ptolomy> Whoa.
18:26:57 * ptolomy burns that into his retinas.
18:27:16 <dcoutts> -Wall will complain about quite a bit of sloppy coding
18:27:20 <dons> dcoutts, now we need to work out how to get a CStringLen back from a buffer, so it can be written
18:27:31 <dcoutts> dons, ah yes
18:28:46 <dcoutts> dons, well we just CString/PackedString.UTF8'ify textBufferGetText
18:29:13 <dons> the layer underneath?
18:29:32 <dons> CString is easiest and most portable
18:29:37 <dcoutts> yep
18:29:47 <dons> I'm only using UTF8 for its UTF8.hGet/hPut
18:29:55 <dcoutts> right
18:30:30 <dons> ok, seems easy enough.
18:30:43 <dons> hIDe/yi is fun!
18:31:17 <dcoutts> I did the other one by modifying gtk2hs, adding a new function that didn't do the CString <-> String conversion and then just looking at the stuff c2hs generates
18:31:22 <dons> I'm actually impressed at how fast this sourceview stuff can do syn hl on a 1M haskell buffer
18:31:31 <dcoutts> I cleaned up the result and sent the appropriate bits to you
18:31:39 <dcoutts> it's not a very difficult procedure
18:31:42 <dons> ok, cool. I'll have a go
18:32:13 <dcoutts> dons, yes, I'm not sure if it's doing the whole thing or being clever and just doing the visible bits
18:32:36 <dcoutts> textBufferGetText self start end includeHiddenChars =
18:32:36 <dcoutts>   {# call unsafe text_buffer_get_text #}
18:32:36 <dcoutts>     (toTextBuffer self)
18:32:36 <dcoutts>     start
18:32:36 <dcoutts>     end
18:32:37 <dcoutts>     (fromBool includeHiddenChars)
18:32:59 <dcoutts> ie if you leave out the >>= readUTFString it'll be ok
18:33:21 <dcoutts> oh, hmm actually you've got to free the returned string (which is what readUTFString does)
18:47:37 <dcoutts> dons, hm I'm trying to design an api to allow plugins to register entries in a tree of pages (ie for browsing files and other heiricharcies)
18:47:49 <dcoutts> it's not as simple as it seems
18:48:34 <dcoutts> we need to be able to lazily generate the tree, eg for a subtree based on a file system
18:48:55 <dcoutts> or for one based on parsing a module
18:49:29 * dons back in about an hour
18:49:40 <dcoutts> ok, I'll probably sleep on it
18:50:07 <dcoutts> g'night
19:02:51 <wagle> in medicine you have "standard of care" to measure the quality of treatment.  what's the equivalent for software engineering?
19:06:51 <int-e> wagle: sales numbers?
19:07:15 * int-e isn't aware of any wide spread standard for that.
19:22:52 * ptolomy wonders how Autrijus justifies his statement that haskell is 'faster than C++'.
19:23:41 <Cale> Perhaps if you include development time :)
19:23:53 <ptolomy> heh. certainly a relevant concern.
19:25:10 <Cale> Lazy evaluation can also help to make some approaches to a problem run a lot faster.
19:25:24 <Cale> (asymptotically faster even)
19:25:54 <Cale> but you could always expend extra effort in C++ to get them to be equivalent.
19:26:01 <int-e> and having a ready to use garbage collector can also help a lot in some cases - reference counting (which is often used) can be very costly.
19:28:32 <orbitz> isn't reference counting generally frouned upon?
19:28:47 <orbitz> althouhg in haskell you can' thave cyclic types , which is the majo rlimiting facto rin RC right?
19:29:49 <Lemmih> "can't" is such a strong word.
19:30:25 <orbitz> hrm well, let's not us eit
19:34:45 <sh10151> RC is great for a lot of typical GC use cases
19:38:27 <Lemmih> dons: Did yi+gtk move to scannedinavian.org?
19:39:21 <Cale> @eval let x = 1 : x in take 10 x
19:39:27 <lambdabot> [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
19:39:43 <Cale> That's a cyclic data structure.
19:39:55 * int-e rephrases his last statement: 'having a 'real' GC can also help in some cases. Often applications that require some garbage collection resort to reference counting (because it's easily implemented) which can be very costly (if the application manipulates those pointers heavily).
19:40:48 <Cale> (x is)
19:41:55 <Cale> You can build more complicated things like doubly linked circular lists using essentially the same technique.
19:43:34 <wwf> Anyone feel up to coddling a newbie?
19:43:43 <Cale> wwf: what do you need help with?
19:44:19 <wwf> I am learning Haskell.  I am writing an advanced fibonacci number generator.
19:44:38 <Cale> okay
19:44:52 <wwf> I have one coded up, but it is inefficient since the function does not remember what was already evaluated.
19:45:00 <wwf> Would you like to see it?
19:45:04 <Cale> sure
19:45:19 <wwf> fib n | n == 0  = 0
19:45:19 <wwf>       | n == 1  = 1
19:45:19 <wwf>       | n == 2  = 1
19:45:19 <wwf>       | n `mod` 2 == 0   = fib (n `div` 2) *
19:45:19 <wwf>                            ( fib ( n `div` 2 + 1 ) + fib ( n `div` 2 - 1 ) )
19:45:20 <wwf>       | n `mod` 2 == 1   = fib ((n+1) `div` 2) * fib ((n+1) `div` 2) +
19:45:22 <wwf>                            fib ((n-1) `div` 2) * fib ((n-1) `div` 2)
19:45:25 <Cale> there are various ways to get Haskell to memoise things
19:45:36 <wwf> Is that the name for this?
19:45:55 <Cale> yeah
19:46:36 <wwf> Memoise?  The problem here is that to evalute fib n, one doesn't need to evaluate all fib a | a < n
19:47:11 <wwf> Most examples use an array or a list.  Can you have a list or array with holes?
19:47:23 <Korollary> you can have a hash table
19:47:53 <Korollary> you can also have an array with holes if you want
19:48:11 <Cale> Right, you don't.
19:48:35 <Cale> wwf: remember that Haskell is lazy, so if you don't look at a list element, it's not computed
19:49:33 <wwf> How then could I define a list with fib n?
19:49:35 <Korollary> a list has a slow lookup performance, tho
19:50:10 <Cale> well, what people commonly do, though it's not the same as your algorithm, is something like  fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
19:50:51 <wwf> Yes, but to cacluate fib 1024, I need to calculate fib 1023.
19:51:03 <Cale> right -- you want logarithmic performance
19:51:20 <wwf> Yes, that is the advantage of this method.
19:51:49 <Cale> Storing the results in a list will likely run into some problems because you'll want to index the list, which has cost linear in the index
19:51:52 <wwf> I am using the tutorial Haskell for C programmers.  It suggests trying to implement non-trivial things.
19:52:11 <Cale> You could use an array, but arrays are bounded.
19:52:44 <wwf> A hash table would seem to fit the bill.  I have looked at the definitions, but do not know how to use it.
19:52:54 <Cale> You could use a Map or IntMap reasonably well, and it has logarithmic lookup cost.
19:53:12 <Cale> It's also easier to work with than a Hashtable
19:53:56 <wwf> Ok, I will look up IntMap.  Hopefully some examples will also be present.
19:54:06 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data.IntMap.html
19:54:15 <wwf> I am still trying to get the concept of storing a value out of my mind.
19:54:48 <Cale> hmm...
19:55:02 <Korollary> why are you trying anyway ?
19:55:24 <Cale> I've never actually done it that way -- it's actually questionable whether you could define a Map/IntMap lazily
19:55:50 <wwf> You cannot store values in Haskell.  Storing is a procedure.  You define things in Haskell.
19:55:59 <Cale> Korollary: compute fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time
19:56:21 <wwf> In all my interpretive languages, I have always mixed the two concepts up.  Now I have to separate them.
19:56:21 <Korollary> Cale: I don't know how to
19:56:31 <Cale> wwf: yeah :)
19:56:56 <Cale> wwf: worrying about efficiency at the same time as learning to do that makes things difficult :)
19:58:20 <neadjneki> if you know the internals, you can filter good practices immediately
19:58:29 <wwf> Yes, but I have a lot of languages under my belt.  Prolog, lisp, forth, C, perl, etc.
19:59:06 <wwf> The efficiency is part of the allure of Haskell.  That is why I want to learn it.
19:59:34 <Cale> perhaps there would be a nice way to define a binary tree with all the fibonacci numbers in it :)
20:00:48 <Korollary> wwf: are you comfortable with doing i/o in haskell yet ?
20:01:42 <wwf> Not really.  At least 4 times I have thought I have finally grasped monads.  Then some example code fries my mind.
20:02:07 <Cale> wwf: did you read MonadsAsContainers, by any chance?
20:02:27 <wwf> I may have.  I have read many things about Monads.
20:03:02 <Korollary> wwf: read this one if you haven't : Tackling the awkward squad by the author of GHC : http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/
20:03:09 <wwf> I think of them as containers of hidden states.
20:03:13 <Pseudonym> data Tree = Node Tree Tree | Leaf Integer
20:03:20 <Pseudonym> let fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) in foldr1 Node (map Leaf fibs)
20:03:34 <Pseudonym> Can't get it down to one line without the data declaration, sadly.
20:03:59 <Korollary> one liners are overrated anyway
20:04:06 <Pseudonym> BTW, Cale: http://andrew.bromage.org/darcs/
20:04:15 <Cale> Pseudonym: that's not the particular tree I was thinking of :)
20:04:17 <int-e> @paste
20:04:17 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MonadsAsContainers
20:04:17 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
20:04:42 <Cale> there's the MonadsAsContainers article, which presents a somewhat different view from lots of other places
20:05:23 <Korollary> We should run a genetic algorithm on all these monad tutorials to create the one true monad tutorial...
20:05:42 <Pseudonym> No need for a genetic algorithm.   Aa Markovchin should do.
20:05:46 <Pseudonym> Markov chain
20:06:06 <wwf> Thanks for all your help.  I think I have enough reading for a while.
20:06:28 <Korollary> a Markov chain ?
20:07:00 <Cale> wwf: you could do it in exactly the same way as an imperative language with a State monad
20:07:43 <Cale> wwf: but that's probably not what you're looking for :)
20:07:54 <lisppaste2> int-e pasted "fibonacci in logarithmic time in Haskell" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/11821
20:08:26 <int-e> I'm using a different approach though - exponentiating a matrix.
20:09:40 <Pseudonym> Yes.  If you think about it hard, though, you'll discover that you only need two elements of the matrix.
20:10:06 <int-e> hmm. yes, two are equal and the fourth is the sum of the other two. correct.
20:10:27 <Pseudonym> My algorithm is very similar to that, but also goes to a lot of trouble to optimise base cases.
20:11:20 <int-e> but I didn't feel like obfuscating the underlying idea. *g*
20:11:24 <Pseudonym> :-)
20:11:35 <Pseudonym> Well actually, my algorithm isn't obfuscated.
20:11:41 <Pseudonym> It's based on fib (2*n) = (fib (n+1))^2 - (fib (n-1))^2
20:12:27 <Pseudonym> Which is a very pretty identity.
20:13:07 <wwf> That is much like my basic algorithm, except I think that my fib n may be your fib n+1
20:13:15 <Pseudonym> Possibly.
20:13:21 <wwf> What is fib 3?
20:13:34 <dons> Lemmih, yi+gtk is now 'yi' on scannedinavian.org
20:13:37 <int-e> wwf: fib 0 is 0, 1 is 1
20:13:47 <int-e> in my case.
20:13:54 <Pseudonym> *Math.Fibonacci> nth Fibonacci 3
20:13:54 <Pseudonym> 2
20:14:27 <Pseudonym> You can also extend the Fibonacci numbers in the negative direction.
20:14:36 <wwf> Ahh, I missed the minus sign.
20:14:54 <Lemmih> dons: I've pushed a patch to the repo.
20:14:58 <Pseudonym> *Math.Fibonacci> nth Fibonacci (-10)
20:14:58 <Pseudonym> -55
20:15:17 <Pseudonym> *Math.Fibonacci> nth Fibonacci (-11)
20:15:17 <Pseudonym> 89
20:15:18 <wwf> I use fib (2*n+1) = fib(n+1)^2 + fib(n-1)^2.
20:15:24 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:15:58 <Pseudonym> So if you have fib (n-1) and fib n, you can compute fib (2*n) and fib(2*n+1)
20:16:35 <sh10151>  just use the #^$%ing constant time solution
20:16:39 <sh10151> :-P
20:16:42 <dons> Lemmih, got it.
20:16:50 <Pseudonym> sh10151: Code? :-0
20:16:50 <dons> looks like our repo is working nicely
20:17:09 <sh10151> aaarg
20:17:29 <Cale> sh10151: I'm unaware of an actual constant time solution. There's a closed form, but it's not constant time to evaluate it :)
20:18:26 <Pseudonym> It's also hard to work with using large integers.
20:18:33 <sh10151> yeah but it's all happening in hardware so who cares?
20:18:34 <sh10151> :)
20:18:45 <sh10151> close enough for jazz
20:19:13 <Pseudonym> Real jazz musicians would use a more sophisticated algorithm.
20:19:41 * Pseudonym writes some code to compute Coltrane sequences
20:19:49 <wwf> Well, time to go... Thanks again.
20:19:58 <Korollary> no problem
20:20:01 * Cale plays an R demolished chord.
20:20:39 <lisppaste2> int-e annotated #11821 with "same thing but using pairs instead of 2x2 matrices with 2 redundant entries" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/11821#1
20:21:32 <sh10151> phi^n / sqrt(5)
20:21:34 <sh10151> :-P
20:22:09 <Pseudonym> Errr... no.
20:22:28 <Pseudonym> You mean phi^n + (1/phi)^n
20:22:37 <Pseudonym> Or something.
20:22:42 * Pseudonym can never remember it
20:22:58 <Korollary> mathworld.com ?
20:23:06 <Pseudonym> Mathworld knows all.
20:23:08 <sh10151> no I mean round(phi^n/sqrt(5))
20:23:36 <int-e> (phi^n - (-1/phi)^n) / sqrt(5)
20:23:45 <int-e> or closest integer to phi^n/sqrt(5)
20:23:49 <Pseudonym> That's the one.
20:24:11 <Pseudonym> OK, you compute fib 1000000 using that formula.
20:24:14 <Pseudonym> I'll wait.
20:24:21 <dons> Lemmih, pushed a patch affecting Emacs2.hs
20:25:30 <Pseudonym> Unfortunately when you start working with numbers this big, printing them out takes longer than computing them.
20:25:42 <int-e> yep :(
20:25:50 <Pseudonym> *Math.Fibonacci> nth Fibonacci 1000000 `seq` ()
20:25:50 <Pseudonym> ()
20:25:50 <Pseudonym> (0.69 secs, 1852868 bytes)
20:25:54 <Pseudonym> Which is fine.
20:26:11 <Pseudonym> But displaying the number can take hours.
20:26:13 <sh10151> good point
20:26:28 <int-e> fib 1000000 -> big number, (59.23 secs, 961235132 bytes)
20:26:29 <sh10151> i guess it's never come up past the first several ;)
20:27:48 <int-e> *Main> fib 1000000 `mod` 17 -> 13 (0.37 secs, 10880456 bytes)
20:28:33 <Pseudonym> Do enough of that, and you could work it out via the Chinese remainder theorem.
20:28:55 <int-e> uh. hmm. but I got the number already ;)
20:29:40 <Pseudonym> Unfortunately, this doesn't work with other sequences.
20:30:33 <Pseudonym> *Math.Combinatorial> factorial 100000 `mod` 17
20:30:33 <Pseudonym> 0
20:30:33 <Pseudonym> (10.63 secs, 77936428 bytes)
20:30:34 <int-e> well the matrix approach works with arbitrary linear recurrences. the reduction of the nxn matrix to n entries works, too.
20:30:38 <Pseudonym> I could have worked that out myself.
20:31:11 * Pseudonym nods
20:31:16 <int-e> (or maybe to 2n-1 entries - that could be more efficient)
20:31:39 <Pseudonym> Lunch.  BBS
20:33:03 <int-e> (hmm, the reduction to just n entries should be more efficient - it involves fewer multiplications with big numbers)
20:35:20 <TheHunter> [ot]: "2N line segments none of which _ a restriction of the identity": should _ be 'is' or 'are'?
20:35:25 <TheHunter> *restrictinos
20:35:34 <Cale> is
20:35:42 <TheHunter> thanks.
20:35:53 <Cale> hmm
20:36:07 <Cale> yeah, I'll stay with that :)
20:36:17 <TheHunter> "is a restriction / are restrictions to" be precise.
20:36:44 <Cale> none of which are restrictions would mean that no collection of them is a restriction
20:36:45 <TheHunter> that's the only one that can make sense to a German anyway, but I'm hearing a lot of "none of us are"
20:37:08 <Cale> hmm, that's true
20:37:19 <Cale> hehe
20:37:51 <Cale> is sounds natural enough to me here
20:38:35 <TheHunter> http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxnoneis.html
20:38:49 <TheHunter> i'll stick with is.
20:39:47 <int-e> that gives two reasons for 'is' in this case. :)
20:41:05 * int-e wonders what it means for a line segment to be a restriction of the identity.
20:42:10 <TheHunter> that the corresponding line isn't \x -> x
20:43:00 <TheHunter> well, "corresponding" is probably not the correct word.
20:43:04 <Lemmih> Good night, #haskell.
20:43:25 <TheHunter> G'night, Lemmih.
20:43:47 <TheHunter> @timein Copenhagen
20:43:50 <lambdabot>  Tuesday, September 20, 2005 at 5:32:20 AM CEST
20:45:04 <Cale> The line segment is given as a function [0,1] -> S where S is some metric space, and the line segment is not its own rectification?
20:45:29 <Cale> I suppose you need more than a metric space :)
20:46:02 <Cale> I suppose you'd probably want a normed vector space
20:46:12 <TheHunter> actually the functions are all [0,1] -> [0,1]. It's a stupid problem anywya.
20:46:23 <Cale> ah
20:46:24 <Cale> okay
20:47:27 <int-e> ah! restriction of the identity to a subinterval of [0,1].
20:47:49 <TheHunter> we are supposed to show that every such function has an approximation with few fixed points, and the obvious thing works but is kinda technical.
21:03:39 <maayhme> 'lo
21:27:11 <Pseudonym> Back.
21:36:33 <Korollary> how was lunch ?
21:38:17 <Pseudonym> OK
21:38:46 <Pseudonym> mmm.
21:39:12 <Pseudonym> I wonder if there's a fast way to compute the inverse of fib.
21:39:32 <Pseudonym> i.e. for some x, the smallest n such that fib n <= x < fib (n+1)
21:40:07 <Korollary> I'm confused. Isn't there only one n that satisfies that ?
21:40:35 <sieni> Korollary: but the question was to compute that n quickly, given x
21:40:49 <ibid> good morning
21:41:08 <Korollary> it is, but smallest n implies to me that there could be multiple.
21:41:27 <Pseudonym> Which there is if you extend fib to negative n.
21:41:31 <Pseudonym> Hmm.
21:41:35 <Korollary> oh
21:41:37 <Pseudonym> OK, the positive n such that...
21:41:44 <Pseudonym> Oh, also, fib 1 == fib 2
21:41:52 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
21:41:55 <Pseudonym> But you know what I mean.
21:41:59 <sieni> Pseudonym: natural numbers are a linear order, so there is at most one "smallest"
21:42:00 <Korollary> I forgive you
21:42:00 <Pseudonym> A meaningful inverse.
21:42:40 <Pseudonym> sieni: fib has a meaningful definition on all integers, not just natural numbers.
21:43:15 <sieni> ah, you were talking about the inverse, not the "smallest n" thingie
21:43:21 <Korollary> Pseudonym: so for negative numbers, we assume a definition that satisfies fib(1) and fib(0) ?
21:43:37 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:44:25 <Korollary> aren't fib(n) negative for n < 0, then ?
21:44:31 <Pseudonym> fib(-n) | n `mod` 2 == 0 = - fib n
21:44:32 <Korollary> no
21:44:38 <Pseudonym>         | otherwise = fib n
21:45:07 <Pseudonym> Think about it.  fib 0 = 0, so fib (-1) + fib (-2) = 0
21:45:24 <Korollary> alternating. I see.
21:45:28 <Pseudonym> Right.
21:46:20 <Pseudonym> An alternative would be a log(n) algorithm to test if n is a Fibonacci number.
21:46:33 <Korollary> inverse fib doesn't make much sense for the negative n,then.
21:46:39 <Pseudonym> No, guess not.
21:47:56 <Korollary> I think that test would be as hard as your original problem
21:48:48 <Pseudonym> Probably the easiest way to do it would be to invert (phi^n / sqrt 5)
21:48:56 <Korollary> let's google if this madness has always been investigated by another disturbed soul...
21:49:10 <Pseudonym> And then search around there.
21:49:43 <Pseudonym> http://www.cs.duke.edu/~mlittman/courses/Archive/cps130-97/lectures/lect03/node9.html
21:49:45 <Pseudonym> There you go.
21:49:51 <Korollary> I was looking at the same page
21:50:05 <Korollary> This is some interesting quote: "Consecutive Fibonacci numbers are the worst-case input for Euclid's algorithm."
21:50:18 <Pseudonym> Yeah, I knew that.
21:50:28 <Pseudonym> They're also the worst case for Huffman coding.
21:50:49 <Pseudonym> In the sense that they produce the longest codewords.
21:51:18 <Korollary> I knew that this Fibonacci guy was up to no good...
21:51:56 <Pseudonym> Fibonacci numbers also produce the worst ratatouille.
21:53:20 <Korollary> "The role of the Fibonacci numbers in botany is sometimes called Ludwig's law  (Szymkiewicz 1928; Wells 1986, p. 66; Steinhaus 1999, p. 299)."
21:54:26 <sieni> maybe one would need a fibonacci number shitting bear as well
21:55:19 <vegai> have you heard about em mathematical freaks/savants who can feel number sequences?
21:55:53 <vegai> "If a number is soft and round on the edges, it's a prime number"
21:56:17 <Korollary> I've heard of such people
21:56:31 <vegai> there was a documentary about it on local tv recently
21:56:36 <vegai> weird stuff.
21:56:52 <vegai> I wish they had gone into checking how large prime numbers they can feel
21:57:11 <vegai> apparently it has nothing to do with computing the numbers, so perhaps they could feel arbitrarily large numbers
21:57:39 <Korollary> I don't remember much, but in any case I would not trust the accuracy of the human mind when it comes to large numbers.
21:57:44 <Pseudonym> "This one feels very big."
21:58:06 <vegai> Korollary: nor I, the concious mind. They had something else going on.
21:58:31 <Pseudonym> They have a general field sieve coprocessor hardwired into the brain.
21:58:34 <vegai> I'm pretty sure it was a real documentary
21:58:44 <Korollary> vegai: I think that was said of one memory champion guy. He just couldn't explain how he did certain calculations.
21:59:21 <vegai> I guess this is -blah material, sorry O:)
21:59:34 <Korollary> Pseudonym is not in #haskell-blah
21:59:53 <Pseudonym> I'm in #haskell-lies.
22:00:03 <Pseudonym> Oh, look!  There's the Bolivian navy going past my window!
22:00:04 * vegai proposes #haskell-benchmarks.
22:00:07 <sieni> maybe they have a part of brain that is able to communicate with the world of mathematics directly
22:00:16 <vegai> or -statistics
22:00:24 <Pseudonym> They said that of Ramanujan.
22:00:35 <Korollary> I thought he was a space alien.
22:00:36 <Pseudonym> That he could just "see" things.
22:00:50 <vegai> perhaps math is much easier than we think
22:00:59 <vegai> we're just making an awful mess out of it
22:01:12 <Korollary> I never thought math was hard.
22:01:24 <vegai> Korollary: give me the 5827. prime number, please.
22:01:36 <vegai> too late!
22:01:44 <Korollary> that doesn't mean I considered it trivial or labor-free, though.
22:01:56 <sieni> I think everybody has a point where math starts to become hard work. For some people that point is just further than for others
22:02:29 <Korollary> if proofs start taking hundreds of pages, I guess we're all out of steam.
22:04:10 <Pseudonym> I've always found topology difficult.
22:04:11 <Korollary> doesn't the four-colour theorem have about 1800 base cases that are used to prove the rest ? That's bureucracy.
22:04:26 <Pseudonym> Most of maths, for me, is a deciphering exercise.
22:04:39 <sieni> speaking of steam, that guy has quite a bit of it: http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/
22:04:41 <Pseudonym> Once you've worked out the notation, the rest is usually straightforward (though not necessarily trivial).
22:04:44 <Korollary> I'd agree with deciphering.
22:04:50 <sieni> probably a future fields medalist
22:04:57 <Pseudonym> Oh, I met Terry Tao.
22:05:02 <Korollary> If your name is Tao, you cannot lose.
22:05:04 <Pseudonym> He's a seriously smart guy.
22:05:17 <Korollary> not with those glasses at least...
22:06:06 <sieni> and I guess he solved a long standing problem about prime numbers with somebody some time ago
22:06:13 <Pseudonym> He won big in the Maths Olympiad one year, when I only made it as far as the interstate finals. :-)
22:06:34 <sieni> http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/
22:06:37 <sieni> oops
22:06:44 <sieni> http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.NT/0404188
22:07:17 <sieni> well, but Math Olympiads are a picnic for the guy, since he clearly has potential for a Fields Medal
22:07:20 <Korollary> interstate in the .au ?
22:07:26 <dons> maybe we should have a Haskell Olympiad :)
22:07:29 <Pseudonym> Yes.
22:07:38 <Pseudonym> Terry Tao was from Adelaide, IIRC.
22:07:42 <Korollary> ah
22:08:27 <sieni> to work
22:08:35 <Pseudonym> To work!
22:08:40 * Korollary raises his glass
22:08:41 <sieni> ---:
22:08:41 * Pseudonym taps glasses
22:08:44 <sieni> oops'
22:08:47 <sieni> --->
22:09:01 * Korollary fedex'es sieni a new keyboard
22:09:34 <lament> ---:   - that's prolog
22:11:24 <Korollary> neat link from Tao's site : http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/index.htm
22:11:31 <Korollary> logical fallacies.
22:17:03 <Korollary> and, isn't icfp the haskell olympiad already?
22:17:12 <lispy> so i was trying to learn some ocaml while i was waiting today, and it appears that pattern matching in ocaml sucks compared to haskell
22:17:49 <lispy> but, maybe i'm not learned in the ways of the caml
22:18:03 <dons> yeah, I guess it is
22:18:05 <Korollary> lispy: are you in Texas ?
22:18:18 <Korollary> hmm, wrong question
22:18:23 <Pseudonym> It's not a Haskell Olympiad if O'Caml can enter.
22:18:47 <Korollary> it's a haskell olympiad if ocaml cannot compete ;)
22:48:57 <lament> icfp a haskell olympiad?
22:53:53 <humasect> can one.. "import Test.File -> module Test.File where >> Test.File.hs" ? =)
22:59:29 <Cale> humasect: what?
23:40:45 <vegai> humasect: no, Test.File is Test/File.hs, right?
23:41:16 <ski> or Test.File.hs, i think
23:41:29 <vegai> really?
23:41:41 <ski> (possibly even Test/Test.File.hs is allowed, not sure)
23:41:54 <vegai> oh, ok
23:41:59 <ski> Test/File.hs is allowed, in any case
23:57:37 <humasect> yeah =) ok thanks. ( i am exporting data into haskell code into ghci for the moment. )
23:58:04 <humasect> the exported code became cleaner than the Smalltalk version, if that is interesting to anyone
23:58:28 <vegai> I have some Smalltalk-advocating friends who might be interested :P
23:58:31 * vegai wears a troll mask.
23:58:36 <humasect> ^_^
