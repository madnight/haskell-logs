00:01:40 <Muad_Dibber> so, is the official perl6 implementation already finished actually?
00:01:58 <sethk> Korollary, oh, that's why I don't know what it is.
00:02:18 <palomer> is anyone still excited about perl6?
00:02:37 <sethk> palomer, not me, obviously.  :)
00:02:56 <sethk> palomer, but, to be fair, I'm unexcited about it without knowing much about it.
00:03:10 <palomer> quite frankly, it's not a very exciting language
00:03:13 <gaal> pugs is not the official implementation. but it's the most advanced so far.
00:03:42 <Muad_Dibber> gaal: i know pugs is not the official one
00:03:45 <Muad_Dibber> thats why i asked
00:04:24 <gaal> Muad_Dibber: okay; I mentioned it's the most advanced one so far -- there is no official implementation yet.
00:05:38 <Muad_Dibber> so
00:06:16 <Muad_Dibber> they are spending ages on an interpreter/compiler/virtual machine/whatever for a non exciting promoted script language? :P
00:07:43 <gaal> not everybody thinks it isn't exciting, apparently. what does "script language" mean in your description?
00:07:57 <palomer> Muad_Dibber: do you think it's a coincidence that it's taking 5 years?
00:09:02 <Muad_Dibber> palomer: i do not believe in coincidence, although i suppose you have a causal connection i mind i guess?
00:09:13 <palomer> yes, noone gives a ****
00:09:23 <Muad_Dibber> gaal: a language which is most properly suited to write a (collection of) scripts in
00:09:33 <palomer> jacques!
00:09:35 <palomer> merde?
00:09:45 <palomer> (****=hoot)
00:09:47 <jacquesmerde> you rang?
00:09:53 <palomer> your name rocks
00:10:06 <Muad_Dibber> where script are easy written programs that handle system jobs/invocations/things like that.
00:10:30 <jacquesmerde> ....no, yours rocks
00:10:59 <palomer> jacquesmerde: that's because we have the same name!
00:11:38 <gaal> well, if by "most" you mean that it's better at it than most others, you're probably right; if you mean it's good at that exclusively, you're probably wrong :-)
00:13:59 <pejo> Muad_Dibber, people rarely care what the best language for a certain task is, hence perl will be used in many places - suitable or not. So it might be worth spending time on it, just like people spend ages on C-compilers.
00:14:29 <gaal> but I still wonder about my Haskell question. Which debugger/tracer should I try for a large program that uses GHC extensions? Buddha? Hat?
00:15:55 <gaal> I can return to my more specific problem, which is debugging a parser that uses Parsec.
00:19:02 <sethk> gaal, I don't remember if there is tracing built into the parsec functions.  I vaguely remember something about it, but I'm not 100% sure that it was parsec, as I was looking at parsec and happy at the same time.
00:26:46 <gaal> I didn't see anything about it in the docs, and now looking at the source I still don't see anything about it. :(
00:27:08 <sethk> gaal, I'll see if I can spot what I'm sort of remembering.
00:27:18 <gaal> Thank you.

02:18:29 <joelr> Cale: ping
02:18:35 <joelr> folks, does this make any sense?
02:18:35 <joelr> class (HList l, HList l', HList p) => Layout p l l' | p -> l l', l l' -> p where
02:18:38 <joelr>     layout :: p -> (l, l') -> (l, l')
02:24:16 <joelr> hmm... am i split or something?
02:25:23 <ski> me wonders what layout is supposed to do ..
02:25:44 <joelr> well, i'm just zipping down a list of tuples and unzipping them
02:26:00 <sethk> ski, what?
02:26:08 <joelr> the layout describes a HList with a (default element, the pickler for that element)
02:26:11 <sethk> ski, oh, in his code, sorry
02:26:18 <ski> sethk : sorry ?
02:26:30 <joelr> i want to do this
02:26:31 <joelr>         layout (HCons (e, pe) p) (l, l') =
02:26:32 <joelr>             layout p (HCons e l, HCons pe l')
02:26:46 <sethk> ski, never mind, I didn't realize he had "layout" in his code, and I was thinking about indentation
02:26:58 <ski> m
02:29:24 <lisppaste2> joelr pasted "Fundeps" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13444
02:29:59 <joelr> ski: what do you think?
02:30:41 <ski> hm
02:30:43 <ski> looking
02:32:19 <ski> hm, so the types in the lists should match as   'e' and 'PU e' ...
02:32:28 <joelr> ski: 100%]
02:34:39 <ski> hm, i have an idea .. lemme just see if it's right
02:35:52 <ski> ah, hm
02:35:52 <ski> layout :: p -> (l, l') -> (l, l')
02:35:52 <ski> layout (HCons (e, pe) p) (l, l') = layout p (HCons e l, HCons pe l')
02:35:57 <ski> the definition can't be typed in that way
02:36:09 <joelr> hmm
02:36:28 <ski> layout :: HCons (e,PU e) p -> (l, l') -> (HCons e l,HCons (PU e) l')
02:36:36 <ski> is the specialized type, in this instance
02:36:40 <ski> (pun intended)
02:36:50 <joelr> ski: so long as i can recursively zip down that datastructure and stop at HNil, i'm good
02:36:54 <joelr> does the above work?
02:36:59 <ski> the type of the second argument doesn't match the type of the result
02:37:16 <joelr> ski: so what to do then?
02:37:19 <tic> shapr around?
02:37:20 <ski> i think maybe you need a typeclass with 5 args
02:37:24 <joelr> ouch
02:37:26 <joelr> ok
02:37:42 <ski> is it necessary that it reverses ?
02:37:48 <joelr> ski: nope
02:38:15 <shapr> tic: pong?
02:38:16 <ski> then it should be doable, if you yank out the (nominal) tail-recursion
02:38:20 <tic> shapr, yay!
02:38:28 <ski> (doable with 3 args, i mean)
02:38:32 <joelr> ski: yank it? but don't i need it?
02:38:50 <joelr> ski: don't think i can do withou tit
02:38:51 <ski> hm
02:38:58 <sethk> joelr, well, either he is very sadistic, or he thinks you don't need it.  :)
02:39:01 * ski tries to think, again
02:39:03 <joelr> ski: otherwise how am i gonna walk down the list?
02:39:23 <tic> shapr, I now know why I want a monad. If I want write a Turtle program using my structures, I'd have:  Forward 10 (Right 90 (Forward 10 Stop)), to do a forward 10, right 90, forward 10 and halt.
02:39:34 <ski> it seems you want to unzip a HList, where each element is of form (e,PU e), is that correct ?
02:39:41 <tic> shapr, the lab seemed to explicitly state this was the way to do it.
02:39:45 <joelr> correct
02:39:56 <joelr> ski: and i want to zip it into a tuple of two lists
02:40:01 <ski> right
02:40:06 <ski> unzip
02:40:12 <joelr> ski: maybe i ought to look at the libraries, maybe there's something like that in HList.
02:40:12 <boegel|home> tic: you're writing Turtle stuff ? :) you should check out HaskLS, which uses Turtle Graphics for drawing L-systems (kindoff
02:40:14 <boegel|home> )
02:40:15 <ski> no zipping here, that i can see
02:40:33 <joelr> ski: ok, unzip it into a tuple of lists
02:40:42 <shapr> tic: Yes, I think you've got the why.
02:40:42 <tic> shapr, so if I want to do this, I need to manually make a linked list like I just described, right?  Now, if I define bind on Turtle, I can just do Forward 10 >> Right 90 >> Forward 10 >> Stop
02:40:55 <joelr> damn
02:41:00 <joelr> HZip.hs
02:41:01 <tic> boegel|home, that'd be cheating. :)
02:41:04 <tic> boegel|home, and besides, no fun. :)
02:41:11 <ski> class (HList l, HList l', HList p) => Layout p l l' | p -> l l', l l' -> p

02:41:19 <ski>   layout :: p -> (l,l')
02:41:20 <tic> shapr, so that's why I want a monad. See? Does that make sense?
02:41:23 <tic> boegel|home, indeed!
02:41:35 <boegel|home> tic: oh :| is Duncan you teacher ?
02:41:36 <tic> boegel|home, I seem mostly to have issues w/ the Monad instance

02:41:51 <boegel|home> tic: ok, nvm then :)
02:41:59 * boegel|home fiews
02:42:00 <tic> shapr, so, is that the correct conclusion?
02:42:05 <shapr> I've always wanted to have Lennart Augustsson as a teacher.
02:42:20 <shapr> tic: You're on the right track, yes.
02:42:31 <tic> shapr, great! see, I did want a Monad instance. :)
02:42:47 <shapr> :-)
02:42:48 <tic> shapr, anyho.. the problem is with the actual instantiation.  I can't seem to get it working.
02:42:51 <ski> layout (HCons (e,pe) p) = (HCons e l,HCons pe l')
02:42:52 <ski>   where
02:42:53 <ski>   where (l,l') = layout p
02:43:05 <tic> shapr, I'll hack a bit more and then see if I can nopaste some source.
02:43:11 <shapr> tic: I can give you the answer, but leading questions will get you further.
02:43:16 <ski> joelr : but, possibly HZip does what you want ..
02:43:33 <tic> shapr, thanks.  leading questions gives me more satisfaction.
02:43:59 <joelr> ski: looking into it
02:44:12 <sethk> I can contribute some misleading questions if you like.  :)
02:44:18 <shapr> tic: For example, let's go back to the nested structure you wrote. How would you draw the result to the screen?
02:45:35 * ski hasn't really decided yet if he likes HList
02:45:45 <joelr> ski: it works wonders for me
02:46:00 <tic> shapr, runTurtleRun! :: Turtle
02:46:01 * ski leans on the 'dislike' opinion ..
02:46:30 <shapr> tic: OK, let's say you're not drawing to the screen, but instead generating a bitmap that you'll later display. How would you generate a bitmap or even a 2D array representing the bitmap from the nested data structure?
02:46:34 <joelr> ski: you just don't need to cook them ;)
02:46:56 <tic> shapr, runT :: Turtle -> [[Color]], perhaps?
02:47:09 <pesco> Hah, Haskell is so much better than Bash.
02:47:17 <pesco> Haskell as in GHCi that is.
02:47:34 <shapr> tic: Ok, and how would that work?
02:47:34 <tic> runT (Forward 10) t = (ten pixels):runT t
02:47:37 <joelr> ski: hUnzip did the trick :) i'm starting to enhoy this!
02:47:39 <tic> shapr, kinda.
02:47:47 <ski> joelr : ok, fine ..
02:47:53 * pesco mirrors the "disappeared" H.P. Lovecraft archive.
02:48:01 <joelr> ski: but thanks a lot for your help!
02:48:04 <shapr> tic: How would the ten pixels update an array?
02:48:07 <ski> Lovecraft !
02:48:18 <shapr> There's a lovecraft archive?
02:48:50 <pesco> There used to be, at http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/, but some company turned up that actually owned the rights to his works and so it was taken down.
02:49:10 <tic> shapr, rather, the run needs to be monadic, somehow. *hmm*
02:49:40 <tic> shapr, I'd need to pass in the state into runT' and do everything there.
02:49:59 <tic> shapr, (x, y), color, bitmap.
02:50:10 <pesco> shapr: Good thing they didn't get to archive.org ... ;)
02:51:06 <tic> shapr am I on the rigth track=
02:51:06 <tic> ?
02:52:13 <tic> bah, can't spell nor type.
02:55:22 <tic> Haskell sometimes make me feel like I'm 10 again trying to wrap my head around BASIC
02:56:20 <musasabi> This is evil. "throwDyn someThreadId myException" typechecks but means nothing.

03:14:47 <tic> alive
03:15:43 <fanopnaic> hmm... this works: (head [1,2,3]) : [4,3,2];  this does not: [4,3,2] : (head [2,3])
03:16:03 <fanopnaic> why? :)
03:16:05 <masm> Why is the lambda expression in 'replace2 l = map (\x -> foldr max 0 l) l' evaluated only once?
03:16:07 <eivuokko> @type (:)
03:16:08 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]
03:16:19 <sethk> fanopnaic, because head returns an element, not a list
03:16:29 <eivuokko> It only concatenates new front item
03:16:45 <fanopnaic> aha!
03:16:57 <masm> Actually, the foldr.
03:17:50 <sethk> masm, lazy evaluation.  It won't be evaluated again until it is needed to produce another value
03:20:42 <masm> replace2 [1,2,3] = [(foldr max 0 [1,2,3]) 1, ((foldr max 0 [1,2,3]) 2, (foldr max 0 [1,2,3]) 1], right? By the substitution model.
03:21:04 <ustenzel> shapr: you're adminning the hawiki, right?  why is AttachFile disabled?
03:21:39 <masm> But my timings tell me that it actually equals 'replace l = map (\_ -> m) l where m = foldr max 0 l'
03:22:57 <masm> Mistake:  replace2 [1,2,3] = [(foldr max 0 [1,2,3]), ((foldr max 0 [1,2,3]), (foldr max 0 [1,2,3])]
03:28:01 <shapr> tic: Sorry, cute woman is visiting me. I'm distracted.
03:28:18 <tic> shapr, that's okay. :)
03:28:27 <shapr> ustenzel: It's disabled by default, what do you want to attach?
03:28:46 <eivuokko> masm, What is your question again?  Evaluation order or implementation details  how laziness/referential transparency are implemented?

03:56:11 <masm> eivuokko, I think my question is about implementation details... How is it that by the substitution model one thing should be evaluated n times (n being the length of the list) and in reality it is evaluated only once.
03:56:20 <masm> Must read more, I guess.
03:56:39 <tic> Grr, I just can't get a datatype that works when instantiating it in the Monad class.. :(
03:57:45 <eivuokko> masm, I think you probably need to find out about referential transparency.
03:58:16 * boegel|home is seeing more and more new people passing by in #haskell
03:58:18 <boegel|home> hey lkrt
03:58:22 <sethk> tic, you don't usually instantiate a monadic type
03:58:40 <tic> sethk, I don't know the proper term for it..
03:58:47 <tic> sethk, instance Monad Turtle where ....
03:59:11 <sethk> tic, perhaps I don't understand what you are trying to do.
03:59:31 <tic> sethk http://rafb.net/paste/results/CyIUts45.html <-- but I want to use do-notation instead.
03:59:40 <sethk> tic, let me look...
03:59:43 <shapr> ustenzel: There is the Flippi wiki engine in Haskell.
04:00:38 <ustenzel> shapr: I know.  But there's not too much point in transferring all content from hawiki, is there?
04:01:27 <sethk> tic, something like:   p = do {forward 10; right 90; forward 20; Stop}
04:01:38 <tic> sethk, exactly.
04:01:50 <shapr> ustenzel: There could be actually, hawiki isn't licensed. A new wiki instance could be.
04:01:59 <tic> sethk, and I figured the way to do that was to instantiate Turtle in the Monad class.
04:02:51 <sethk> tic, I don't see what that buys you.
04:03:02 <ustenzel> shapr: what do you mean, not licensed?
04:03:05 <tic> sethk, the do notation?
04:03:20 <tic> sethk, I want it to be easy to write programs in my language.
04:03:26 <tic> sethk, I don't consider $ to be nice.
04:03:49 <shapr> ustenzel: I wish that there were a set license for all HaWiki content. Something like "Any content you contribute here must be released under the BSD3 (or maybe CC or GFDL?) license."
04:03:55 <sethk> tic, no, I don't see what making Turtle monadic buys you
04:04:08 <shapr> That way anyone could use the content for documentation, their own commercial products, or whatever.
04:04:14 <sethk> tic, it doesn't need to be, you can use the do notation with functions that aren't monadic
04:04:21 <sethk> tic, only p itself has to be monadic
04:04:40 <tic> sethk, meaning?
04:05:00 <tic> what type would p have, for example?
04:05:08 <sethk> tic, p is monadic simply because you use do
04:05:31 <sethk> tic, if p's (non-monadic) type is (), then it could be  IO IO
04:05:37 <sethk> tic, sorry,  IO ()
04:05:58 <tic> sethk, and to use do with "forward", "right" etc I need to define bind on Turtle!  Which is the same thing as instantiating Turtle in Monad. No?
04:06:23 <sethk> tic, brb
04:06:27 <shapr> @remember stephen_turnbull First Principle of Herding Cats: Put the cats in a box, then herd the box.
04:07:16 <Lemmih> tic: Check out the state monad.
04:07:44 <tic> Lemmih, don't I have to do gets and such all the time, then?
04:08:01 <pesco> ski: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~pesco/archive/lovecraft/
04:08:28 <Lemmih> tic: 'forward' and 'right' would.
04:09:07 <tic> Lemmih, I guess that could work. But why don't I want to instantiate Turtle as a Monad?
04:10:06 <Lemmih> Turtle doesn't make sense as a monad.
04:10:40 <sethk> tic, because it doesn't accomplish anything
04:11:04 <tic> sethk, it draws on the screen.. ?
04:11:23 <sethk> tic, ok, for that reason you may want to, yes
04:11:32 <sethk> tic, I meant that simply to sequence, it isn't necessary
04:11:45 <sethk> tic, but you may be able to use the IO monad anyway.
04:12:15 <sethk> tic, if you need state, then the state monad makes sense.  But you need to identify why you want a monad, before you can choose the best one or define your own.
04:12:16 <tic> sethk, okay.  I'm not quite sure I understand this completely, so I'll probably go with the route I posted originally and have an ugly language :/
04:12:30 <dcoutts> tic, for a program I've got that does turtle graphics I seperate the turtle movement part from the actual IO of drawing to the screen.
04:12:33 <sethk> tic, actually I don't see a problem with $
04:12:44 <sethk> dcoutts, separate, not seperate   :)
04:12:56 <dcoutts> sethk, er yeah :-)
04:12:58 <sethk> dcoutts, that's the most frequently mispelled word in technical literature.  :)
04:13:14 <tic> dcoutts, the problem is more of actually building the tree in a nice way, here.
04:13:15 * dcoutts was never good at spelling to begin with
04:13:52 <dcoutts> tic, a good design principle is to seperate the IO part from the computation part
04:14:01 <sethk> dcoutts, if only English were as consistent as haskell.  :)
04:14:01 <dons> separate is hard though. my "new imperial dictionary" from 1952 in fact lists both versions as valid
04:14:02 <Lemmih> heh.
04:14:17 <sethk> dons, sacrilege   :)
04:14:23 <sethk> dons, !!!!
04:14:25 <dons> heh
04:14:44 <sethk> you must separate separate from seperate
04:14:48 * Lemmih wonders if dcoutts misspelled 'separate' again on purpose.
04:15:15 <dcoutts> :-0
04:15:30 <tic> what's seperate mean?
04:15:33 <tic> same thing?
04:15:34 <dons> I don't have a good mnemonic for 'separate'. anyone think of one?
04:15:55 <dcoutts> according to google separate beats seperate 366 million to 9 milion :-)
04:16:07 <dons> tic, "seperate" is supposedly wrong. but was acceptable in 1952.
04:16:16 <tic> dons, *nod*
04:16:18 <dons> in the british empire, at least
04:16:24 <masm> When evaluating '\l -> map (\_ -> foldr max 0 l) l' the value of 'foldr max 0 l' is, like, 'cached' after the first evaluation, right? Because of referential transparency... I bet that the actual implementation of haskell bears little resemblance to the substitution model.
04:16:28 <dcoutts> dons, well perhaps the noun could be onw spelling and the verbe the other
04:16:44 <dcoutts> verb
04:16:48 <masm> Where can I read about haskell/lazy functional programming language implementation?
04:17:05 <masm> s/where/what
04:17:06 <dons> The Implementation of Lazy Functional Langages, perhaps? ;)
04:17:27 <dons> hard core details: The spineless-tagless G-machine paper.
04:17:45 <dons> intro, in SPJs book and tutorial with the above title
04:19:36 <tic> *hm*
04:20:53 <masm> dons, I'm just starting with functional programming. Is Peyton Jones's book good for me? Is it not to hard?
04:21:50 <dons> hmm. the book is good.
04:21:56 <dons> it leads you in gently
04:22:03 <dons> and it's free online
04:23:29 <dons> @seen araujo
04:23:29 <lambdabot> I haven't seen araujo.
04:23:42 <dons> must be holiday season in columbia
04:25:16 * dcoutts thinks it's Venezuela?
04:25:51 <dons> ah, my mistake. yes.
04:26:57 <dons> fun spam idiots. what's wrong with this msg: "If your e-mail software does not support html, please click here."
04:26:58 <shapr> masm: Graph reduction can look like substitution.
04:27:09 * shapr chortles
04:27:26 <dblhelix> don't get me started
04:27:50 <shapr> I get a lot of claimed to be html messages from my clients who send from MS Outlook.
04:28:19 <shapr> emacs doesn't like whatever off brand of xhtml they use, I have to dump it out to a file and use firefox on it.
04:28:29 <dons> hmm!
04:28:49 <shapr> Many times I have seriously considered sending my replies in TeX.
04:29:53 <dons> hehe. I think compiled Haskell strings would be good
04:30:15 <dons> with the tag "just execute it!"
04:30:25 <shapr> Yeah, bytecode.
04:30:44 <boegel|home> dons: heh ! cool :)
04:30:54 <skew> nah, TeX is obviously something meant to be text that your software just can't handle
04:30:55 <tic> woo, bus error trying to show my tree
04:31:27 <elemental32> wht is haskell??
04:31:40 <shapr> elemental32: It a means of expression.
04:31:51 <shapr> Programming is the Magic Executable Fridge Poetry, It is machines made of thought, fueled by ideas.
04:32:07 <dons> @factt haskell
04:32:07 <lambdabot> haskell: Haskell is the language of choice for discriminating hackers.
04:32:20 <dons> @where haskell
04:32:20 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/
04:32:53 <elemental32> This is a hacking room??
04:33:19 <ski> this is a programming room, amongst other things
04:33:21 <shapr> elemental32: If you consider programming == hacking, then yes.
04:33:21 <boegel|home> how do I check process info on unix ? what is executing, how long, and so on... for one single process ?
04:33:30 <sethk> tic, bus error?  That's impressive.  :)
04:33:48 <shapr> elemental32: 'A cool hack' originally meant an elegant and unexpected solution.
04:33:58 <musasabi> Has anyone used STM for an application which does IO on the side?
04:34:01 <tic> sethk :)
04:34:08 <shapr> musasabi: No, but I want to know if it's possible.
04:34:14 <elemental32> yeah but wht i mean for hacking is breaking into some system unauthorize
04:34:21 <shapr> elemental32: That's 'cracking'
04:34:28 <elemental32> Oh okay
04:34:36 <ski> or 'netrunning'
04:34:37 <elemental32> So you guys crack i mean hack??
04:34:48 <Lemmih> musasabi: IO inside STM transactions?
04:34:54 <elemental32> you disassemble programs and modify it??
04:35:00 <yozora> another cracker for justice?
04:35:01 <dons> we use unsafeCoerce# sometimes
04:35:08 <shapr> Mostly we write programs and do cool stuff with them.
04:35:12 <musasabi> Lemmih: yes. (and after commit, but that is not important)
04:35:34 <elemental32> WTF haskell is another programming language??
04:35:40 <ski> yes
04:35:42 <pesco> Yay!
04:35:43 <elemental32> Wht are its advantages
04:35:44 <elemental32> ??
04:35:46 * pesco cheers.
04:35:52 <ski> it's lazy !
04:35:58 <pesco> But functional!
04:36:03 <boegel|home> elegant!
04:36:10 <shapr> It's beautiful!
04:36:12 <musasabi> Also how do I create a counter which does not cause contention with STM?
04:36:15 <elemental32> Would you choose it over C or C++??
04:36:23 <sethk> elemental32, to do what?
04:36:23 <Lemmih> @type GHC.Conc.unsafeIOToSTM
04:36:24 <lambdabot> forall a. IO a -> GHC.Conc.STM a
04:36:30 <ustenzel> It discriminates Hackers from mere mortals!
04:36:31 <boegel|home> elemental32: because it's lazy, functional, elegant, beautiful :)
04:36:34 <elemental32> Can i do Win32 with it??
04:36:34 <sethk> elemental32, you need to work forwards, not backwards
04:36:36 <Lemmih> shapr: It's definitely possible.
04:36:41 <boegel|home> elemental32: sure!
04:36:45 <sethk> elemental32, you match your tool (language) to your task.
04:36:53 <elemental32> Can i do lowlevel stuffs there?
04:36:53 <shapr> Lemmih: Is there a safe IO to STM or vice versa?
04:36:56 <musasabi> Lemmih: is that redone or the results kept when retrying (or unspecified) ?
04:37:00 * dblhelix never uses unsafeCoerce#!
04:37:06 <dblhelix> well... :$
04:37:08 <Muad_Dibler> discrimination is prohibited by law. :P

04:37:22 <dons> yes, in fact.
04:37:22 <musasabi> elemental32: yes.
04:37:27 <elemental32> Can i use it for systems programming??
04:37:28 <elemental32> ok

04:37:48 <pesco> elemental32: Personally, I grew up as a C Programmer, later thoroughly learned C++. Since I've discovered Haskell, I do all my hacking (you know) in it.
04:37:50 <sethk> elemental32, you can, but that doesn't mean that you should.
04:37:51 <dblhelix> this asks for a Tour

04:38:15 <shapr> musasabi: Hey, I got the House on Ethernet TUN/TAP code working last night.
04:38:18 <Lemmih> musasabi: I think the IO is re-executed but I'm not sure.

04:38:42 <dons> damnit. @google is timeing out.
04:38:52 <musasabi> lambdabot is having a bad day it seems.
04:38:52 <elemental32> Evrything the way it handles class is very similar to C# and Java

04:39:39 <sethk> @google google
04:39:50 <dons> sethk, stop hurting lambdabot
04:39:54 * shapr grins
04:40:00 <musasabi> Lemmih: a larger problem is creating a counter which works even if some transactions abort. i.e. all transactions do a "
04:40:08 * boegel|home sees lambdabot crying "Make them stoo-oop"
04:40:20 <musasabi> do x <- readCounter ; writeCounter (x+1); return x
04:40:22 <boegel|home> sethk: you do know what lambdabot looks like, don't you ?
04:40:27 <Lemmih> musasabi: Can't you put the counter in a TVar?
04:40:38 <musasabi> And when one of them aborts it will cause a cascade of aborts.
04:40:42 <elemental32> so haskell is functional programming??
04:40:43 <sethk> boegel, sure, more or less.
04:40:47 <dons> bah.
04:40:47 <elemental32> never heard of this kind before
04:40:55 <boegel|home> sethk: http://www.elis.ugent.be/~kehoste/haskell-blah/lambdabot_dcoutts.png
04:40:58 <musasabi> Lemmih: I want to avoid the cascading abort scenario.
04:41:04 <shapr> elemental32: It means that it really works like a mathematical equation.
04:41:10 <elemental32> Would programming be easier with this??
04:41:14 <boegel|home> elemental32: it's cool, you should try it
04:41:19 <dblhelix> elemental32: give it a chance, it only takes a few minutes to fall in love with it
04:41:26 <boegel|home> elemental32: for instance, I build a raytracer using only 150 lines of core code
04:41:29 <dblhelix> someone please show him quicksort ;)
04:41:33 <boegel|home> :)
04:41:34 <dons> it is. less bad things go wrong, and the language prevents errors
04:41:35 <ustenzel> elemental32: learn FP.  It will even help with your dysfunctional, err, procedural programming style.
04:41:43 <elemental32> ok ill try later
04:41:45 <shapr> elemental32: I built a mailing list search webapp with 200 lines of code.
04:42:01 <yozora> @pl \x y z -> z y >>= \a -> x a
04:42:04 <elemental32> im currently focusing on low level stuffs maybe later when i get bored
04:42:16 <elemental32> the syntax looks unique though
04:42:22 <shapr> Yeah, Haskell has awesome syntax.
04:42:33 <dblhelix> after you'll have learned haskell, you'll never be bored
04:42:58 <dons> it's not unique elemental2, there's a large range of fp languages going back to lisp in the 60s
04:43:07 <elemental32> The only thing that would keep me from learning it is JOB vacancy for Haskell programmers
04:43:10 <shapr> > [ (x,y) | x <- [1..9], y <- [1..9], x * y > 9]

04:47:29 <shapr> I'm a self-employed contract programmer.
04:47:34 <dons> I'm employed to write Haskell, so it's not a hobby ;)
04:47:38 <sethk> elemental32, what kind of statement is that?
04:47:44 <elemental32> OC
04:47:54 <sethk> elemental32, I've been a professional software engineer for 25 years.
04:48:07 <shapr> I've only been a pro for ten years or so.
04:48:10 <yozora> we are righteous programmers
04:48:12 <dons> are you a hobby programmer, elemental32?
04:48:26 <shapr> But I've been programming for fun for 23 years.
04:48:26 <yozora> with the power of haskell
04:48:28 <dcoutts> elemental32, and various other people here are academic researchers
04:48:36 <elemental32> sethk: i mean most programmers youll see in forums and chat dont earn money for wht theyre doing. They just love it thats why they do it.
04:48:50 <elemental32> And most of them are good
04:49:01 <dons> ah, open source programmer, perhaps you mean.
04:49:06 <ValarQ> elemental32: well, you almost have to like what you are doing to be good at it
04:49:10 <sethk> elemental32, actually, those who do that are rarely high quality programmers
04:49:21 <sethk> elemental32, they don't do the dreary parts, they just do the sexy parts
04:49:35 <pesco> elemental: Not sure which way you're trying to slice us here, but this is obviously the channel of choice for discriminating hackers. ;-)
04:50:24 <shapr> elemental32: Anyway, lots of smart and interesting people here. A few of us also ride unicycles.
04:50:35 <ValarQ> heh
04:50:39 <Muad_Dibler> very few do :P
04:50:40 <pesco> Hihi.
04:51:12 <sethk> I ride a unicycle for the 0.5 seconds that my front wheel is in the air before my back wheel.
04:51:28 <Muad_Dibler> well
04:51:32 <Muad_Dibler> i tried riding a unicycle
04:51:34 <Muad_Dibler> but it endd
04:51:44 <Muad_Dibler> *ended up with the unicycle riding me
04:52:01 <shapr> elemental32: This is me - http://www.scannedinavian.com/images/shae-sj.png
04:52:05 <elemental32> bback. I just peeped in to see whts inside here. Nice talking to all. Ill give this language a try its sounds interesting coming from you guys
04:52:21 <shapr> Have fun, cya later.
04:52:23 <ValarQ> shapr: the typical haskell programmer look :)
04:52:28 <elemental32> ok srp
04:52:50 * elemental32 looking at shrps pic
04:53:12 <sethk> elemental32, don't look for one magic language.  Learn the strengths of various languages, and select the appropriate one for a task.
04:53:30 <yozora> @help
04:53:30 <lambdabot>  @help <command> - ask for help for <command>
04:53:35 <yozora> @help yow
04:53:36 <lambdabot> Yow!
04:53:38 <dons> sethk is very practical :)
04:53:44 <ski> (though, haskell is *a* magic language)
04:53:57 <shapr> Sometimes sed is a better solution.
04:54:05 <ValarQ> ski: yeah, but you should look for more than one of them
04:54:11 <shapr> dons: have you seen http://members.surfeu.fi/tjsa/bbe/ ?
04:54:17 <sethk> dons, I think that is a crucial point and one that is rarely considered.
04:54:20 <ski> ValarQ : agreed
04:54:31 <sethk> dons, that we put the cart (what tool to use) before the horse.
04:54:32 <ValarQ> like regular expressions, that is another magical language
04:54:49 * ski thinks logic programming is underrated, e.g.
04:54:56 <sethk> dons, by "we" I mean your run of the mill software engineer, not "we" in this room, of course.
04:55:18 <dons> ah, yes.
04:55:31 <dons> i was just going to say that this room is full of people who know about which tools to use :)
04:55:45 <Muad_Dibler> oh
04:55:50 <Muad_Dibler> i know another magic language!
04:55:56 <Muad_Dibler> can i tell you about it?
04:56:03 <ValarQ> Muad_Dibler: tell us! tell us!
04:56:07 <Muad_Dibler> Perl!
04:56:11 <ValarQ> aieeee
04:56:12 <Muad_Dibler> you can write almost anything
04:56:12 * ValarQ hides
04:56:18 <Muad_Dibler> and it produces still some kind of result
04:56:18 <dons> the cart before the horse thi is very true though. i.e. OO solves everything, let's teach it to first year students :}
04:56:24 <Muad_Dibler> now thats magic!
04:56:27 <sethk> dons, people here are interested in the characteristics of lanauges.
04:56:32 <dons> right.
04:56:49 <sethk> an interest that is sadly lacking in the commercial world.
04:57:31 <dons> Muad_Dibler, but it's very hard to predict what the result will be!
04:57:48 <dons> just just know there will be one. It's an existential language ;)
04:58:22 <ValarQ> and i haven't forgiven perl for almost killing awk :(
04:58:33 <ski> "for most strings. there exists a corresponding denotation" ?
04:58:43 <vegai> sethk: unfortunately, for many problems, there are many strong languages
04:59:34 <sethk> vegai, I'm not sure why that is unfortunate.  My point, though, is that the question is rarely even considered.
04:59:52 <sethk> vegai, I hear "we're a java shop" or "we're a c++ shop" all the time.
05:00:03 <vegai> it's unfortunate if a dice is your best bet
05:00:09 * dons sighs with tiredness, and hugs the typechecker
05:00:18 <vegai> because many people don't dare to use a dice to solve that :)
05:00:26 <dons> the only reason I can still code while this sleepy. thankyou mr. type system.
05:01:05 <dons> sethk, that's interesting. we get spoilt in academia
05:02:19 <sethk> dons, that's true.  I wish I could go back to academia and be spoiled.  :)
05:03:03 <yozora> @yow
05:03:03 <lambdabot> YOU PICKED KARL MALDEN'S NOSE!!
05:06:12 <Muad_Dibler> why don't you sethk?
05:06:32 <sethk> Muad_Dibler, only have a BSEE
05:07:26 <Muad_Dibler> you can always start a new study, like japanase or something :P
05:07:31 <JKnecht> has heard academe can be as much of a viper pit as biz.
05:07:33 <dons> a new hmp3 screenshot: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hmp3.png
05:07:48 <sethk> Muad_Dibler, not at my age.
05:08:12 <ValarQ> dons: hmp3?
05:08:29 <dons> haskell mp3 player
05:09:06 <ValarQ> dons: why not hogg? :)
05:09:07 <Muad_Dibler> :(
05:09:14 <Muad_Dibler> was going to ask that ValarQ :P
05:09:19 <Muad_Dibler> or hmp being haskell mediaplayher :P
05:09:22 <ValarQ> Muad_Dibler: :P
05:09:34 <ValarQ> or hmpc :D
05:09:44 <ValarQ> to use with mpd
05:09:59 <Muad_Dibler> ? :P
05:10:02 <dons> ah. yes, shapr suggested this. i'll look at it.
05:10:18 <Muad_Dibler> what's the hmpc and mpd standing for? :P
05:10:37 <ValarQ> Muad_Dibler: http://musicpd.org/
05:10:44 <wolverian> mpd is neat.
05:10:53 <dons> currently I know you can use mpg{321,123} in the backend, but others speak the same protocol too, I think.
05:10:56 <ValarQ> yeah, i can't use another musicplayer now
05:11:23 <dons> "hogg" is kinda cute
05:11:35 <ValarQ> dons: hmp3 really sounds like a backend itself
05:12:03 <pesco> dons: Woo! We need a southpark picture for the Typechecker!
05:12:37 <dons> ValarQ?
05:13:34 <ValarQ> dons: the spelling of the name suggests that it is a backend
05:13:53 <pesco> hogg is cute.
05:16:11 <dons> yeah, I think perhaps I should look at an mpd interface
05:16:18 <dons> looks like a nice tool
05:16:41 <wolverian> ncmpc is a nice frontend for mpd
05:16:53 * ValarQ also uses ncmpc
05:17:19 <dons> the curses frontend?
05:17:38 <ValarQ> yeah
05:17:41 * resiak checks that this is still #haskell and that #mpd hasn't just moved one window to the left.
05:18:13 <dons> I wonder why mpd isn't in the openbsd ports tree.
05:18:20 <ValarQ> http://arda.no-ip.org/ncmpc_shot.png
05:18:41 <ValarQ> dons: dunno, it is in the freebsd tree
05:19:25 <dons> ok. but it's a bit ugly compared to: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hmp3.png ;)
05:19:32 <dons> though it makes me want to simplify the mp3 gui a bit more
05:19:42 <wolverian> simplification++
05:19:45 <vegai> ValarQ: what's the WM there?
05:19:51 <ValarQ> dons: the colors hurt my eyes
05:20:09 <dons> you only have black and white receptors?
05:20:15 <ValarQ> vegai: IceWM
05:20:25 <vegai> cute
05:20:29 <ValarQ> dons: i have receptors?
05:20:41 <dons> joke, receptors in your retina, for colours.
05:21:03 <ValarQ> dunno, i have never looked around in my eyes
05:21:04 <wolverian> dons, it is a good idea to work with both white and bg term colours, though
05:21:27 <dons> of course b/w also works 
05:21:43 <wolverian> er, I meant white and black background colours
05:21:51 <wolverian> not b/w (colourless) terms :)
05:21:54 <musasabi> Can anyone explain why http://youzen.b2.fi/~musasabi/t.hs works like it does? It combined IO and STM and the end result is not what I am expecting.
05:22:21 <dons> yes, that works. it's just ncurses so you can go nuts in the config file
05:22:49 <dons> the img above is supposed to be vaguely muttish/ipodish colours (if possible)
05:23:01 <wolverian> mutt on a white background? HERESY
05:23:24 <wolverian> anyway, back to discrete maths lecture :) dons++ # more mpd frontends!
05:23:58 * ValarQ would use a haskell frontend for mpd
05:24:05 <dons> i don't know what everyone has with black backgrounds. there's empirical evidence that states you comprehend faster with black on white bg
05:24:26 <dons> and we all like comprehenions! esp. fast ones
05:24:44 * vegai is trying to read what dons just said
05:24:45 <dons> ValarQ. cool. ok. i should really look at mpd, since about 5 people have mentioned it
05:24:54 <vegai> ah, there
05:25:03 <dons> it parsed?
05:25:11 <vegai> no, you see, I have black background
05:25:27 <dons> yes, i figured as much. i have some .Xresource files that will fix that problem.
05:25:46 <dons> ;)
05:25:46 <Lemmih> musasabi: What did you expect, OOI?
05:25:55 <vegai> I'd like them to test me for that background thingie. I don't really buy it
05:26:15 <vegai> I suspect it's more to do what people are used to, and people are generally used to reading black text on white
05:26:18 <dons> well, i switched over to white. it seems to help when I'm tired.
05:26:19 <ValarQ> dons: to many console junkies in the channel i guess :)
05:26:22 <vegai> unless those empirical tests were a bit more clever?
05:27:15 <dons> we train our eyes for years with black on white, so it could be that. i'd have to find this paper
05:28:00 <musasabi> Lemmih: Having "foo" "bar" repeat for "foobar" but "foo" not repeating for "bar" seems illogical.
05:28:24 <musasabi> Lemmih: either "foo" "foo" "bar" "foo" "bar" "foobar" or "foo" "bar" "foobar"
05:29:13 <musasabi> "foo" "bar" "foo" "bar" "foobar" seems hard to explain.
05:30:59 <dons> ah! I definitely could add an mpd backend to hmp3.
05:31:08 <dons> the protocol is almost the same as mpg321/1223
05:31:29 <dons> ValarQ et al. thanks for the pointers!
05:31:41 <ValarQ> dons: no prob
05:32:07 <Lemmih> musasabi: "foo" and "bar" is written to 'ch', printer prints [foo,bar], "foobar" added to 'ch', printer restarts and prints [foo,bar,foobar], ...?
05:32:44 <dons> nightol!
05:34:34 <musasabi> Lemmih: Shouldn't it be "foo" is added to ch, "bar" is added to ch, "foobar" is added to ch as they are all separate transactions.
05:35:03 <musasabi> or is it just convenient timing?
05:36:15 <musasabi> And playing back all the values that have ever been in the channel does not seem like something I would like in a real app.
05:37:03 <Lemmih> The forked transaction doesn't get to evaluate before 'sleep' is called and it restarts every time 'ch' is changed.
05:38:45 <musasabi> "forkIO $ let loop = atomically (readTChan ch) >>= print >> loop in loop" seems to be a more sensible implementation to print the values.
05:39:40 <musasabi> (it prints "foo" "bar" "foobar" "bazzzz"
05:41:33 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Is the use of CFG right on the cfg parser?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13450
05:46:49 * SamB downloads
05:47:28 <Frederick> SamB, Ive rebuild ghci now the definitions you pointed me yesterday ar working
05:47:54 <SamB> Frederick: nice
05:48:47 <Frederick> SamB, but I got some doutbs about the parsing, that discussion we were having were Cale was explaining my the pattern matching of the structure In using againts the pattern Ive created to the gramamr
05:49:59 <SamB> Frederick: oops, I forgot to supply arguments to Symb in that
05:50:38 <SamB> (in the data type definition for CFG)
05:51:25 <Frederick> SamB, so I should add Symb :: String?
05:52:00 <SamB> Frederick: nah, you need to change [[Symb]] to [[Symb t nt]]
05:52:50 <SamB> oh, and the Symb right after Map to (Symb t nt)
05:53:55 <Frederick> SamB, tons of errors here now
05:54:05 <Frederick> none of the patterns seem to be matching
05:54:27 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Confuzzled" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13451
05:54:36 <SamB> Frederick: don't worry, I have the same thing
05:55:01 <Frederick> SamB, what do you mean?
05:55:29 <Frederick> the same version of the source right?
05:56:13 <SamB> looks like
05:56:20 <Frederick> k
05:56:21 <SamB> most of this is in the definition of expr
05:59:33 <Frederick> but it was "working" before, why is the definition wrong now, I know that Ive changed the definition of production so the problem might be the way Im passing the parameters to the parser
06:00:43 <SamB> you can change the "productions" bit to
06:00:45 <SamB>   , productions  = fromList [(NT 'E', [("add",[NT 'E',T '+',NT 'E'])
06:00:45 <SamB>                                       ,("mul",[NT 'E',T '*',NT 'E'])
06:00:45 <SamB>                                       ,("val",[T 'i']              )])]
06:00:57 <SamB> or not
06:01:19 <SamB> oops, my bad.
06:01:27 <Frederick> ?
06:02:16 <SamB> Frederick: I should have said [(ProdName,[Symb t nt])] rather than (ProdName,[[Symb t nt]])
06:04:22 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Same error here" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13452
06:06:21 <SamB> okay, did you use that little thing I just pasted in the channel?
06:06:46 <Frederick> SamB, I think so I will repostthe code
06:06:56 <SamB> anyway I have to go to breakfast...
06:07:06 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Checking" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13453
06:07:25 <Frederick> SamB, np I will lunch in like 12~20 mins
06:12:14 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "It also doesnt matches" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13454
06:12:23 <Frederick> anyone alive to give me some directions/
06:18:40 <SamB> ah, well, remember how we kept telling you in this last function how you need "cfg" instead of "CFG" in your "case" expression?
06:18:47 <SamB> it was true!
06:18:58 <SamB> we weren't lying!
06:22:46 <Frederick> SamB, I know you dont lie Cale said me it yesterday but as Ive just said I didnt remmeber what did he say exactly
06:25:35 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "keeps doesnt matching" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13455
06:27:04 <Frederick> It doesnt matches against map does it mean that my map definition is worng? I want to map a nt into a list o terminals and non terminals
06:27:43 <SamB> okay, allow me to quote myself
06:27:51 <SamB> <SamB>   , productions  = fromList [(NT 'E', [("add",[NT 'E',T '+',NT 'E'])
06:27:51 <SamB> <SamB>                                       ,("mul",[NT 'E',T '*',NT 'E'])
06:27:51 <SamB> <SamB>                                       ,("val",[T 'i']              )])]
06:28:03 <SamB> that should fix it
06:29:12 <SamB> oh, and why do you not have the "deriving (Show)" clauses anymore?
06:29:20 <SamB> those are REALLY quite useful!
06:29:50 <SamB> hmm, that exclamation point is a bit out-of-place
06:29:55 <Frederick> SamB, they were having problems with my old ghci im re-placing them
06:30:34 <SamB> Frederick: oh, okay
06:31:53 <SamB> you know, befunge is probably the only language I've seen where you can run code pasted from IRC with the <nick> tags still in place ;-)
06:32:36 <Frederick> SamB, Ive never heard about this language
06:32:50 <SamB> nevermind, you can look it up after you get this working ;-)
06:33:02 <Frederick> I should add deriving (Show) after data definitions right/
06:33:11 <SamB> Frederick: yeah
06:33:29 <SamB> anyway, I notice you have the code I pasted in there, but commented it out
06:33:56 <Frederick> Doingthis work in haskell will be nice if I learn at least haskell basics I got a good time to do it (3 weeks) and haskell surelly will be very usefull for future ourses I take
06:34:16 <Frederick> SamB, yes follwing cales advice: "When something fails comemnt out think, ask and try again"
06:35:01 <shapr> @remember samb you know, befunge is probably the only language I've seen where you can run code pasted from IRC with the <nick> tags still in place ;-)
06:35:04 <SamB> Frederick: well, when it is something that was just suggested, you could think first, then ask, then comment out
06:35:22 <SamB> shapr: isn't that case-sensitive?

06:36:40 <SamB> yes, it is case sensitive.
06:36:47 <SamB> and it also accepts empty quotes!
06:37:37 <SamB> Frederick: anyways, in this case, kindly uncomment-out my code and comment out the other definition of productions
06:38:44 <SamB> and then you'll see that we are missing Ord on Symb t nt
06:39:23 <Frederick> already done but keeps with parsing error at the end of definition Im also googling for the us of deriving show since I think Im missusing it

06:49:06 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "last" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13457
07:00:21 <Frederick> SamB, you said I miss a parentesis but I cant seem to find wheere, is this parenthesys related to the syntax of the language? Cause at least for my own understanding the nesting seems right
07:01:56 <SamB> Frederick: I think it was in the second line I had pasted
07:02:26 <SamB> oh, maybe the first one
07:02:34 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "this one?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13458
07:03:20 <SamB> Frederick: that seems to parse, at least
07:03:26 <basti_> hi sorje
07:03:54 <sorje> hi basti
07:04:04 <Frederick> SamB, not in here
07:04:26 <Frederick> CFG.hs:35:18:    No instance for (Ord (Symb Char Char))     arising from use of `fromList' at CFG.hs:35:18-25
07:04:43 <Cale> ah
07:04:44 <SamB> Frederick: that parsed. now you have the type error I mentioned.
07:04:56 <SamB> Frederick: this is an improvement, believe it or not!
07:05:12 <Frederick> SamB, things allways get worse before getting better :)
07:05:20 <basti_> sorje: do you know nopcode?
07:05:34 <Cale> add  "deriving (Ord)" to whatever data declaration declares NT
07:05:37 <SamB> you just need to change "deriving (Show)" to "deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)" for Symb
07:06:10 <Frederick> loaded!
07:06:17 <sorje> basti_, no, why?
07:06:20 * Frederick brbr mommy is calling!
07:06:24 <SamB> hehe
07:06:38 <basti_> sorje: he's at the same uni... I just noticed your domain
07:07:44 <basti_> not all that inclined to haskell though ^^
07:07:56 <sorje> basti_, what is he studying? I basically only know math students. ;-)
07:08:03 <basti_> CS
07:08:17 <basti_> that might explain that, and the other thing...
07:08:17 <basti_> ^^
07:09:39 <lightstep> why does the new time library map sunday->0 or sunday->7, but never sunday->1?
07:09:56 <basti_> lightstep: maybe because thats purely USA?
07:10:01 <lightstep> aren't the days enumerated?
07:10:33 <lightstep> basti_, well, it's also this way in large parts of asia and africa
07:10:52 <lightstep> (i believe the muslim calendar works this way)
07:11:01 <basti_> hmm
07:11:20 <lightstep> mapping sunday->0 works, since you can add 1
07:11:35 <basti_> uhm
07:11:37 <basti_> btw.
07:11:45 <basti_> 0 = 7 mod 7 ^^
07:11:55 <basti_> so thats a "no-option"
07:12:31 <lightstep> but you count the weeks differently
07:12:34 <basti_> you're supposed to do any shifts your calendar does on your own
07:12:44 <basti_> ?
07:13:56 <lightstep> the library provides mondayStartsWeek and sundayStartsWeek
07:14:39 <basti_> yes, in computers many people start counting with 0
07:15:37 <lightstep> all these computations are simple, but the library should either contain the right solution, or a neutral default
07:15:54 <basti_> well it is the "right" solution, plus an option
07:15:58 <basti_> (7=0 mod 7!)
07:16:09 <SamB> lightstep: am I to understand that the first day of the week is saturday?
07:17:16 <lightstep> SamB, not where i live, but there are reasons to do it this way
07:18:14 <eivuokko> Uhm, maybe I missed something, but why is it a big deal?
07:18:33 <syntaxfree> [(y,x) | (x,y)<-zip [1..10] [111..120]]
07:18:45 <syntaxfree> is there a way to do away with that zip using (possibly parallell) list comprehensions?
07:18:59 <shapr> yes, get rid of the zip
07:19:25 <shapr> syntaxfree: Wait, what result do you want?
07:19:30 <syntaxfree> don't mind the simple (x,y)->(y,x) example, I'm just thinking of the concept for a larger function I haven't written yet.
07:19:38 <basti_> zip a b = [(x,y) | x<-a, y<-a]
07:19:40 <integral> syntaxfree: [ ... | x <- ... | y <- ... | z <- ... ] # each bit after a | is done in parallel
07:19:51 <basti_> ah no
07:19:51 <basti_> ^^
07:19:53 <basti_> lol
07:19:58 * basti_ hides
07:20:13 <dcoutts> dons, shapr: what do think about this idea:
07:20:13 <syntaxfree> @eval [(x,y)|x<-[1..5], y<-[1..5]]
07:20:14 <dcoutts> http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell/2005-November/016818.html
07:20:14 <lambdabot> [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,1),(3,2),(
07:20:14 <lambdabot> 3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,
07:20:14 <lambdabot> 5)]
07:20:15 <integral> ?plugs [ (x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [1,2] ] {- cross product -}
07:20:20 <syntaxfree> that's not what I want.
07:20:26 <basti_> syntaxfree: yes i noticed
07:20:37 <basti_> just too late ^^
07:20:39 <syntaxfree> I want [(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)]
07:20:54 <lightstep> eivuokko, i don't like symbolic data as numbers, or hard-coded formats like %u/%w
07:20:59 <integral> syntaxfree: each | clause is done in parallel, while a single | clause is done essentially like a cross product
07:21:17 <integral> @eval [ (x,y) | x <- [1,2] | y <- [1,2] ]
07:21:18 <lambdabot>  Illegal parallel list comprehension: use -fglasgow-exts
07:21:21 <psnl> syntaxfree: [(x, x)| x<-[1..n]]
07:21:30 <syntaxfree> psnl: heh.
07:21:37 <syntaxfree> psnl: that is not really what I'm trying to write.
07:21:40 <lightstep> eivuokko, all my problems are solvable, though
07:21:49 <syntaxfree> but, thanks, I'm set :)
07:22:02 <syntaxfree> hmm. maybe not.
07:22:11 <psnl> syntaxfree: ok, cool, I just got the last part of the conversation
07:22:26 <syntaxfree> see, this is what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to implement a kind of numerical integration over an arbitrary domain.
07:22:44 <syntaxfree> So I have a function and a list like [1,3,15,7]
07:22:53 <eivuokko> lightstep, Ah, ok.
07:23:10 <syntaxfree> I want to calculate f(1)*(3-1) + f(3)*(15-3)+f(15)(17-15)
07:23:49 <integral> syntaxfree: sum [ x * y | x <- [1,3,15,17] | y <- tail [1,3,15,17] ] ?
07:23:53 <lightstep> syntaxfree, you need to write foldPairs
07:23:57 <psnl> syntaxfree: is your list like [1,3,15,17] instead of [1,3,15,7]?
07:24:19 <syntaxfree> the first thing I thought, I'll use [(dom!!(n+1)-dom!!n)* f x | x<-dom | n<-[1..length dom]]
07:24:28 <syntaxfree> but I'll stumble at n = length dom or something.
07:24:44 <syntaxfree> @type foldPairs
07:24:45 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `foldPairs'
07:25:17 <syntaxfree> hmm. maybe I need to write a "first difference" function.
07:25:31 <syntaxfree> @hoogle foldPairs
07:25:31 <lambdabot> No matches found
07:26:15 <syntaxfree> @let foldPairs f a = [ f x y | x<-a | y<-tail a]
07:26:15 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
07:26:32 <syntaxfree> @eval let foldPairs f a = [ f x y | x<-a | y<-tail a] in foldPairs [1,2,9,11]
07:26:33 <lambdabot>  Illegal parallel list comprehension: use -fglasgow-exts
07:27:05 <lightstep> you need @pluts
07:27:10 <lightstep> you need @plugs
07:27:34 <syntaxfree> @plugs let foldPairs f a = [ f x y | x<-tail a | y<- a] in foldPairs (-) [1,2,9,11]
07:27:35 <lambdabot>  Illegal parallel list comprehension: use -fglasgow-exts
07:29:26 <syntaxfree> foldPairs f a = [ f x y | x<-tail a | y<- a] : 0
07:29:26 <syntaxfree> fsum f dom = [ a * (f b) | a<-foldPairs (-) dom | b<-dm]
07:29:46 <syntaxfree> that's the solution of my problem. Thanks for trying to help :)
07:33:28 <lightstep> :t \ f seed list = foldr (uncurry f) seed (zip list (tail list))
07:34:34 <Cale> ->
07:34:35 <Cale> ?
07:35:09 <Cale> @type \f seed list -> foldr (uncurry f) seed (zip list (tail list))
07:35:10 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
07:35:15 <lightstep> probably, but i think it's wrong anyway
07:36:07 <lightstep> since you need a whole lot of variations anyway, like doing something with short lists, or using left fold
07:36:36 <Cale> what was the actual issue?
07:37:16 <syntaxfree> I actually need to compute the p-norm of a function.
07:37:25 <earthy> hm damn. I want runtime instance resolving
07:37:26 <syntaxfree> But approximating the integral was a part of it.
07:37:48 <shapr> dcoutts: Cale and I did a bunch of reverting of spam, but the problem was that it became a huge manual chore, and sometimes the next wave of a hundred spams started while we were reverting the previous wave.
07:38:00 <lightstep> earthy, like existential types?
07:38:04 <shapr> dcoutts: I've heard the latest Moin has the ability to batch revert, that might make it worthwhile.
07:38:11 <earthy> lightstep: almost
07:38:32 <roconnor> @hoggle m(a->b) -> a -> m b
07:38:34 <lambdabot> Control.Parallel.par :: a -> b -> b
07:38:34 <lambdabot> Control.Parallel.seq :: a -> b -> b
07:38:34 <lambdabot> GHC.Conc.par :: a -> b -> b
07:38:56 <earthy> I might manage using existentials
07:38:59 <earthy> it'll just look ugly
07:39:00 <syntaxfree> @pl \x->(abs (f x)^p

07:40:21 <roconnor> Is there a name for a function of type (monad m) => m(a->b) -> a -> m b
07:40:22 <dcoutts> shapr, well how about registered users only?

07:40:43 <roconnor> close
07:41:06 <dcoutts> shapr, media wiki must have some protection against automatic bot spam

07:41:27 <syntaxfree> oh. true.
07:41:41 <lightstep> roconnor, sure it does
07:41:57 <roconnor> oh, how do you define it?
07:41:58 <syntaxfree> well, I think the implicit function type would be (Floating b) => b -> (b -> b) -> [b] -> b
07:42:15 <lightstep> roconnor, use Monad.return
07:42:19 <syntaxfree> I want to make it (Integral a, Floating b)=>a->(b->b)->[b]->b
07:42:24 <syntaxfree> but ghci chokes.
07:42:34 <dcoutts> boegel, take a look at this: http://haskell.org/~duncan/gtk2hs/HaskLS.png
07:42:43 <roconnor> hmmm
07:43:07 <roconnor> Is this strength?

07:44:29 <shapr> dcoutts: We use registered users only right now, seems to work fine.
07:44:38 <shapr> dcoutts: But at some point, the spammers will figure it out.
07:44:52 <praseodym> could you give me a quick howto to get haskell with cairo on gentoo?
07:45:05 <roconnor> thanks Cale!
07:45:33 <roconnor> I seem to recall all monads in Haskell are strong.
07:45:41 <roconnor> but I forget the definition of strength.
07:45:48 <roconnor> oh wait, it had something to do with pairs.
07:45:53 <roconnor> so it isn't this.
07:46:12 <roconnor> I wish I had a name for this function.
07:46:27 <praseodym> are cairo bindings included in gtk2hs?
07:46:37 <dcoutts> praseodym, emerge gtk2hs
07:46:50 <dcoutts> praseodym, you need Gtk+ 2.8 or better for cairo support
07:46:52 <praseodym> dcoutts: doing so :) thanks. so it should just work then?
07:47:12 <dcoutts> praseodym, so you need to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" emerge gtk+
07:47:34 <praseodym> dcoutts: running ~x86 with gtk+ 2.8.6
07:47:51 <dcoutts> praseodym, ok then, it should work fine
07:48:18 <praseodym> dcoutts: wasnt it in 0.9.9?
07:48:46 <dcoutts> praseodym, the cairo bindings are new in 0.9.10
07:48:59 <dcoutts> and OpenGL will be in 0.9.11 !
07:49:00 <dcoutts> http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/gallery/OpenGL/HaskLS
07:49:12 <praseodym> dcoutts: ah cool. I got 0.9.9 and tried using them but it failed.. so I know its not my setup
07:49:24 <dcoutts> praseodym, failed?

07:56:31 <Cale> points-free isn't always better
07:56:58 <Cale> the version you passed to pl was fine :)
07:58:00 <cmunier> Hi. Concerning conversion from a Ratio Int value to a Double, are there built-in functions in Haskell to do this (ignoring numerator and denominator in module Ratio)?
07:58:38 <basti_> cmunier: fromRational
07:58:43 <basti_> cmunier: i had to ask, too ^^
07:59:22 <Cale> wonder if Hoogle finds it?
07:59:32 <Cale> @hoogle Ratio Int -> Double
07:59:32 <cmunier> basti_, does not work afaik. It would work with Ratio Integer.
07:59:33 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
07:59:35 <Cale> :|
08:00:09 <basti_> hmm
08:00:23 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?q=Ratio+Int+-%3E+Double
08:00:28 <Cale> that version does though
08:00:30 <basti_> indeed :(
08:00:34 <Cale> it finds realToFrac
08:00:42 <Cale> which works
08:01:43 <Cale> heh, it's funny how const will show up for almost any function type
08:02:08 <Cale> hello xerox!
08:02:20 <syntaxfree> it's odd. I find myself never writing actual recursion in Haskell.
08:02:32 <Cale> syntaxfree: that's right
08:02:32 <xerox> Hello!
08:02:36 <xerox> syntaxfree: same here.
08:02:46 <syntaxfree> in Scheme I'm always writing the most contrived recursion schemes.
08:02:49 <xerox> Except for some things, maybe...
08:02:53 <Cale> You write the recursion once in the form of a folding operation
08:03:02 <Cale> and then you don't really need it
08:03:07 <syntaxfree> Sometimes I'll have to build a small library of recursion patterns with Haskell-inspired names before I can get something done.
08:03:22 <xerox> :-)
08:03:26 <Cale> yeah, I found that too
08:03:51 <xerox> Yeah, it's very, very nice to program by "naming important things".
08:04:01 <Cale> it always seemed like some really basic stuff was missing, or hidden away and obscured when I used common lisp
08:04:56 <Cale> scheme seems nicer, but it also always seemed to be missing things, which might have been in those extensions, but which you'd expect to be in the core language
08:05:12 <syntaxfree> standard Scheme has no "foldl".
08:05:19 <syntaxfree> though most implementations have "reduce".
08:05:21 <Cale> yeah, that was one thing :)
08:05:41 <Cale> I think I had to go out of my way to get a right fold in CL
08:05:48 <syntaxfree> What annoys me about Common Lisp is the naming scope system.
08:05:52 <Cale> oh yeah
08:06:00 <Cale> the function and value slots thing
08:06:00 <syntaxfree> I hate having to write a "funcall" to call a damn function.
08:06:04 <Cale> ugh
08:06:06 <dcoutts> xerox!
08:06:09 <Cale> so irritating!
08:06:15 <xerox> dcoutts!
08:06:24 <dcoutts> http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2005/11/11/more-opengl-goodness/
08:06:27 <syntaxfree> I found no good books about functional programming in Common Lisp, too.
08:06:34 <roconnor> @pf \f a -> fmap (\g -> g a) f
08:06:35 <lambdabot> flip (fmap . flip id)
08:06:35 <cmunier> Cale, wow. realToFrac works. :)
08:06:35 <xerox> dcoutts, ah-ha, I knew!
08:06:45 <syntaxfree> they all seem to be oriented towards a strange imperative style I never learned to associate with Lisp.
08:07:14 <xerox> dcoutts, you should take a video :-)
08:07:36 <dcoutts> xerox, I don't know how
08:07:40 <Cale> I remember going to the common lisp channel and asking about how to remove the unused parameter warnings from my definition of const, and having someone wonder why I'd ever want a constant function.
08:07:58 <Cale> eventually someone more clueful helped :)
08:08:03 <xerox> dcoutts, there is a tiny nice app which uses a VNC server/client trick to record part of the screen to .avi or .swf, I think.
08:08:15 <cmunier> Another question: Is there a way to redefine types (with the same name)?
08:08:34 <dcoutts> xerox, vnc2swf, hmm I'll try
08:08:42 <Cale> cmunier: not after they're defined
08:08:53 <dcoutts> xerox, I don't know if it'll work with OpenGL.
08:08:57 <syntaxfree> I still like the look of Lisp code.
08:09:01 <xerox> dcoutts, me neither :!
08:09:11 <Cale> cmunier: but could you give an example of what you're trying to do?
08:09:16 <dcoutts> xerox, I guess I'll find out! :-)
08:09:19 <syntaxfree> I feel wizardly hacking away on its runes ;-)
08:09:26 <xerox> syntaxfree: I was very happy with sexprs mangling, i.e. macros.  But hey.
08:09:45 <syntaxfree> Lisp is a dynamic language.
08:10:20 <syntaxfree> It's somewhat comparable to Haskell in that it supports recursion and higher-order functions. But is it really in the same chapter as Haskell?
08:10:24 <syntaxfree> *
08:12:25 <Cale> not quite :)
08:12:40 <cmunier> Cale, I'd like to extend an existing data definition with a certain constructor. The module containing it was postulated in our lecture. Our task is to extend the module with a given ability, which would be most effective if I could basically include this module and subsequentially redefine this single definition.
08:12:42 <Cale> I found I spent a lot of time fixing things which should have been type errors
08:12:42 <SamB> its a totally different language
08:12:59 <SamB> Cale: I know what you mean!
08:13:12 <xerox> cmunier: you can hide the previous definition and introduce yours.
08:13:18 <SamB> types are wasted on CL ;-)
08:13:36 <Cale> but when he does that, he'll lose all the functions from the module as well
08:13:41 <xerox> import Foo hiding (Bar)
08:13:41 <xerox> data Bar = Baz | Quux | ..
08:13:54 <Cale> (which act on that type)
08:13:54 <xerox> Urgh, does he?
08:13:57 <Cale> yes
08:14:03 <xerox> Too bad.
08:14:20 <Cale> well, not to mention that they'd probably be broken regardless
08:14:22 <cmunier> Yes, or I had to change the module. Which isn't quite what I want.
08:14:28 <cmunier> However, thank you. :)
08:14:41 <Cale> you can make a new datatype like:
08:15:11 <Cale> data ExtFoo = JustFoo Foo | SomethingNew Bar
08:15:14 <cmunier> Well, then again I had to redefine all functions using the old datatype.
08:15:42 <roconnor> @type \f -> Control.Monad.ap . (liftM f)
08:15:43 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `liftM'
08:15:51 <roconnor> @type \f -> Control.Monad.ap . (Control.Monad.liftM f)
08:15:52 <lambdabot> forall a b (m :: * -> *) a1.
08:15:52 <lambdabot> (Monad m) =>
08:15:52 <lambdabot> (a1 -> a -> b) -> m a1 -> m a -> m b
08:16:21 <xerox> @type \f -> Control.Monad.liftM f
08:16:22 <lambdabot> forall a1 r (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
08:16:27 <xerox> I see.
08:16:52 <roconnor> this is exactly what I want.
08:17:05 <roconnor> although I'm sure it is the same as liftM2
08:17:34 <xerox> Indeed.
08:17:42 <xerox> @type Control.Monad.liftM
08:17:43 <lambdabot> forall r (m :: * -> *) a1. (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
08:18:12 <Cale> > return (,) `ap` [1,2,3] `ap` [4,5,6]
08:18:14 <lambdabot> [(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]
08:18:23 <Cale> > liftM2 [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
08:18:23 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `a1 -> a2 -> r' against `[a]'
08:18:28 <Cale> > liftM2 (,) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
08:18:29 <lambdabot> [(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]
08:18:42 <paolino> good evening
08:18:42 <roconnor> They mention this at the bottom of http://web.mit.edu/ghc/www/libraries/base/Control.Monad.html
08:19:08 <xerox> roconnor: the bleeding edge documentation is there:
08:19:12 <xerox> @docs Control.Monad
08:19:12 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Monad.html
08:20:19 <paolino> Another question on classes, is there a way to implement a method of a superclass in a subclass , so that every instance of the second can use it as default ?
08:20:23 <roconnor> I need to break these things down because my Monad doesn't work on all functions.
08:20:56 <Cale> paolino: I don't think so, but perhaps there ought to be
08:22:31 <praseodym> where can I find demos for the cairo bindings?
08:23:12 <Frederick> yo Cale
08:23:18 <Cale> hi
08:23:49 <xerox> Hmm, re: classes, don't you do instance Foo Bar where foo = foo to accomplish that in the instances?
08:23:52 <Frederick> Ive fixed lots of mistakes with SamB's help
08:24:47 <paolino> Cale , would be very useful  not to duplicate same code on instances.
08:24:55 <paolino> xerox what is foo there ?
08:25:30 <xerox> Hmm, I'm wrong, nevermind.
08:26:20 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "where to go now?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13462
08:30:01 <praseodym> I cannot get http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/gtk2hs/gtk2hs/demo/cairo/StarAndRing.hs?rev=1.2&view=markup working. I keep on getting 'undefined reference' errors with ghc
08:30:11 <pesco> Jeez, is there hsh or hash (i.e. haskell shell), yet?
08:30:13 <Cale> start writing a parser for your language?
08:30:37 <xerox> praseodym: undefined references to what?
08:31:16 <praseodym> : undefined reference to `ControlziMonadziTrans_zdfMonadIOIO_closure' and GraphicsziRenderingziCairo_*
08:31:21 <cjb> xerox: How's your Go doing?  :)
08:31:32 <xerox> cjb: no Go lately <groan>
08:32:08 <cjb> Heh.
08:32:42 <cjb> Not much for me either.  :)  Just moved continent.
08:32:51 <roconnor> what's the definition of ap?
08:33:16 <Cale> liftM2 ($)
08:33:18 <Frederick> yo folks sorry Ive lst con
08:33:24 <Frederick> did you get my question?
08:33:29 <roconnor> what's the definition of liftM2?
08:33:58 <SamB> roconnor: look in Control.Monad?
08:34:03 <Cale> liftM2 f = \x y -> do { a <- x; b <- y; return (f a b) }
08:34:13 <Frederick> yo SamB
08:34:20 <SamB> Frederick: hello
08:34:25 * roconnor feels dumb.
08:34:49 <SamB> roconnor: don't do that!
08:34:55 <SamB> its bad for you
08:35:07 <SamB> feel ignorant, thats normal ;-)
08:35:12 <xerox> cjb: continet?!
08:35:17 <xerox> Continent, even
08:35:27 <SamB> if necessary, feel absentminded
08:35:43 <Frederick> guys in the source Ive just pasted, should I use parsec to generate the parser? Cause the rules are pretty simple, my only doubt is given the entries I got how to refer to then, I know I could use them as the return of a function but I dont seem to be returning them. Im not sure if My question was clear if not I can rephrase it
08:36:32 <Frederick> In fact the only rule I need to check is that each given rule has at most 1 variable before the ->
08:36:44 <Cale> yeah, use parsec -- you'll have to work out the grammar for the language for describing CFGs
08:36:48 <SamB> Frederick: you have some code that isn't returning something?
08:37:46 <Frederick> SamB, at least I couldnt imagine how to get its return, also I think the last version of productions you gave me turned t he patter form (|->) uselles and I tought it would be good to have it
08:38:12 <SamB> Frederick: yup, its true.
08:38:15 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "no return" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13463
08:38:32 <SamB> what I did made |-> useless
08:39:13 <Frederick> SamB, but using |-> would implicate also in using some parser structure I cant figure out cause Ive imagined an entry like S |-> A | B | c
08:39:29 <SamB> which function are you using?
08:39:35 <SamB> er, talking about?
08:39:44 <Frederick> I would like to be able to give the program a kind of separator to say, hey now it is a production Im giving you a rule
08:39:48 <SamB> that you think should return something?
08:40:19 <SamB> Frederick: oh, don't worry, that will parse fine, if you don't expect to be able to say:
08:40:20 <shapr> Silly question, how do I route traffic from one interface to another?
08:40:40 <SamB> "S -> A | B | C; S -> D | E | F"
08:40:52 <Frederick> SamB, I think I should somehow return productions so I can match
08:40:54 <SamB> shapr: you don't.
08:40:59 <SamB> shapr: your OS does.
08:41:20 <Frederick> SamB, this isnt a problem I cant have double entries for the same Variable
08:41:24 <shapr> SamB: Ok, do I just read up on route to get traffic from my tun0 device to go out through eth1 ?
08:41:26 <SamB> shapr: usually with help from your routing tables, which you can access with route(8)
08:41:42 <paolino> is haskell.org up ?
08:41:46 <roconnor> @pf \f a -> f>>=(\g -> (a>>=(\b -> return (g b))))
08:41:47 <lambdabot> (. ((. (return .)) . (>>=))) . (>>=)
08:41:49 <shapr> Was it down?
08:42:11 <SamB> Frederick: thats what I thought, judging from the |'s
08:42:12 <paolino> mmh can't judge with my connection :(
08:42:16 <SamB> er, |s
08:42:30 <paolino> 5 minutes/page
08:42:33 <Frederick> SamB, cause now I cant do expr = "S -> A | B | C";
08:42:57 <roconnor> @pf \f a -> (\g -> (\b -> return (g b))=<<a)=<<f
08:42:58 <lambdabot> (. ((. (return .)) . (>>=))) . (>>=)
08:43:01 <SamB> Frederick: you aren't supposed to be able to
08:43:01 <SamB> you need to parse it
08:43:11 <SamB> Frederick: so, lets write the parser, eh?
08:43:18 <Frederick> SamB, sure
08:43:28 <Frederick> Ive read parsecs docs and have a draft on my notebook
08:44:10 <SamB> lets try starting with terminals, okay?
08:44:47 <Frederick> SamB, oki but I *think* the only restriction on cfgs is on the productions
08:44:53 <roconnor> @pf \foo1 foo2 f a -> (\g -> (\b -> return (g b))`foo1`a)`foo2`f
08:44:53 <lambdabot> (flip .) . flip (.) . flip . (. (return .))
08:44:54 <Frederick> but sure I need to parse the entry
08:46:04 <SamB> Frederick: so do need to parse 'abc' as NT 'a', then NT 'b', and then NT 'c'?
08:46:43 <Frederick> SamB, no, a rule as AS -> "foo" is invalid
08:47:05 <Frederick> cause AS denotes a context like oh if I have an A followed by an S I do foo
08:47:14 <Frederick> all I can have is if I have an S then foo
08:47:21 <SamB> Frederick: I was taling about terminals
08:47:32 <SamB> you want to start at nonterminals? sure, fine ;-)
08:47:37 <SamB> those are easy
08:47:45 <Frederick> SamB, Yes I think they are easier
08:48:01 <Frederick> my draft is to get he list of nonterminals
08:48:30 <Frederick> and simple check the size of each member of the list recursivelly if it is >2 so it isnt a cfg
08:48:58 <SamB> hmm? >2?
08:49:13 <neadjneki> roconnor is that morse-code?
08:49:57 <SamB> okay, I think you'll want to change your Parsec import to "import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec"
08:50:49 <roconnor> @pf \b -> (return . g) b
08:50:50 <lambdabot> return . g
08:51:08 <roconnor> very true
08:51:26 <SamB> Frederick: are nonterminals required to be upper-case?
08:51:35 <gour> dcoutts: ping
08:51:54 <Frederick> SamB, yes according to the syntax the books gives
08:52:24 <Frederick> SamB, in fact a nonterminal can be whatever symbol I want as long it is disjunct of the terminals set
08:52:32 <roconnor> @pf \f a -> (\g -> (\b -> return (g b))`foo1`a)`foo2`f
08:52:32 <lambdabot> flip (foo2 . flip (foo1 . (return .)))
08:52:43 <SamB> Frederick: oh
08:52:46 <shapr> I can't bleev it's not butter!
08:52:52 <joelr> howdy
08:53:00 <Frederick> SamB, this is a concept of what I want http://img195.imageshack.us/my.php?image=suggestion123ji.jpg
08:53:09 <roconnor> @pf \a -> (\g -> (\b -> return (g b))`foo1`a)`foo2`f
08:53:09 <lambdabot> (`foo2` f) . flip (foo1 . (return .))
08:53:32 <shapr> privet joelr
08:53:42 <roconnor> @pf \a -> (\g -> (\b -> return (g b))`bind`a)`bind`f
08:53:43 <lambdabot> (`bind` f) . flip (bind . (return .))
08:53:50 <shapr> >>2
08:54:09 <shapr> > >2
08:54:09 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `>'
08:54:15 <shapr> oh well.
08:55:19 <Frederick> wb SamB :)
08:55:36 <shapr> aw, I missed franka!
08:55:49 <Frederick> SamB, this is the concept of what the parser should do http://img195.imageshack.us/my.php?image=suggestion123ji.jpg
08:56:13 <SamB> sorry about that
08:56:17 <SamB> <Frederick> SamB, in fact a nonterminal can be whatever symbol I want as long it is disjunct of the terminals set
08:56:41 <Frederick> SamB, np :)
08:57:44 <SamB> my connection just went done inexplicably
08:58:10 * shapr sings o/~ I'm a newbie baby, so why doncha kill me o/~
08:58:53 <SamB> oh, so you don't actually need to import "[...].Parsec.Char"
09:00:07 <Frederick> SamB, I havent imported it
09:00:31 <SamB> anyways, you'll probably want a function nonterminal :: [Char] -> CharParser st (Symb Char Char)
09:00:58 <SamB> which takes a list of chars that represent nonterminals
09:01:20 <SamB> its a very easy parser to write
09:01:55 <Frederick> SamB, did you see the pic Ive posted?
09:02:17 <SamB> Frederick: it only loaded halfway
09:02:17 <Frederick> yep the parser simply consists in recursivelly check the size of the head ofthe list
09:03:26 <SamB> let me take another look at the wikipedia page...
09:03:59 <Frederick> SamB, oki, the concept of the parser is something like http://rafb.net/paste/results/797sC586.html
09:06:00 <SamB> Frederick: why are you checking list lengths?
09:06:32 <SamB> oh, were you trying to make sure each nonterminal had at least one production?
09:07:25 <SamB> or that each production had a non-empty expansion?
09:08:18 <SamB> anyway, I don't think you should be trying to check anything at the moment.
09:09:38 <SamB> Frederick: you can't HAVE a list ['AB','S']
09:09:45 <SamB> Frederick: let me show you
09:09:52 <SamB> > ['AB','S']
09:09:53 <lambdabot>  lexical error in string/character literal
09:10:19 <SamB> in this case, it is a character literal, of course ;-)
09:10:23 <Frederick> back
09:11:33 <Frederick> SamB, did you get the concept?
09:12:51 <andys_> umm, is there a good guide to IO in haskell?
09:13:02 <andys_> I'm trying to find a function to read a single byte from a file
09:13:03 <Frederick> andys_, check monads
09:13:07 <andys_> (or possibly a string of them)
09:13:12 <andys_> string/list rather
09:13:35 <syntaxfree> @type <-
09:13:35 <lambdabot> parse error on input `<-'
09:13:43 <syntaxfree> @type (<-)
09:13:44 <lambdabot> parse error on input `<-'
09:13:51 <xerox> (-:
09:14:18 <SamB> <SamB> Frederick: you can't HAVE a list ['AB','S']
09:14:18 <SamB> <SamB> Frederick: let me show you
09:14:18 <SamB> <SamB> > ['AB','S']
09:14:18 <SamB> <lambdabot>  lexical error in string/character literal
09:14:18 <SamB> <SamB> in this case, it is a character literal, of course ;-)
09:14:32 <andys_> Frederick: I'm trying to look through System.IO on the GHC
09:15:08 <SamB> andys_: hGetChar
09:15:15 <andys_> is that guaranteed to read just one byte?
09:15:22 <andys_> as opposed to trying to read unicode or anything?
09:15:23 <SamB> @docs System.IO
09:15:24 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-IO.html
09:15:29 <andys_> I've probably spent too long around Java
09:15:34 <Frederick> SamB, how will I represent the productions so?
09:15:59 <shapr> @quote JohnMeacham
09:16:00 <lambdabot>  Last night I was at this dive bar listening to live music and there was
09:16:00 <lambdabot> this cute girl I was talking too while this guy was there, we started
09:16:00 <lambdabot> ribbing each other in the appropriate way when confronted with the
09:16:00 <lambdabot> situation of two guys talking to the same girl, and our jeers eventually
09:16:00 <lambdabot> turned technical until we were arguing about haskell, perl, and pugs
09:16:02 <lambdabot> development. it turning out he was one of the pugs de
09:16:09 <shapr> arghh
09:17:10 <SamB> Frederick: well, you have a Map which maps each nonterminal to the right-hand-sides of all its productions
09:18:03 <SamB> so you won't be able to parse  "AB -> foo"
09:18:22 <JohnMeacham> heh. "what is said in haskell-blah, stays in haskell-blah"
09:18:25 <andys_> Sam: is a Char in System.IO just single bytes?
09:18:42 <andys_> it repeats Character lots of time in the documentation :p
09:18:49 <Frederick> SamB, so the map structure it self is the parser from the productions format?
09:19:37 <SamB> Frederick: the productions field of the parser, yes.
09:20:07 <Frederick> SamB, cool!
09:20:08 <SamB> or rather, from the grammar
09:20:38 <SamB> anyways, do you need a hint on how to write "nonterminal"?
09:21:00 <Frederick> SamB, sure all hints are welcome
09:22:49 <SamB> you probably want to use oneOf
09:24:24 <SamB> Frederick: any questions?
09:25:00 <Frederick> SamB, lemme read how oneOf works first
09:26:07 <SamB> Frederick: I can tell you that ;-)
09:26:15 <xerox> @index oneOf
09:26:15 <lambdabot> Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Char, Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec
09:26:26 <xerox> @type Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.oneOf
09:26:27 <lambdabot> forall st.
09:26:27 <lambdabot> [Char] -> Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Char.CharParser st Char
09:26:51 <SamB> "oneOf chars" accepts any char in the list chars and returns it
09:29:25 <dcoutts> gour, pong
09:29:45 <dcoutts> @seen marcot
09:29:46 <lambdabot> I haven't seen marcot.
09:30:13 <gour> dcoutts: here i'm
09:30:38 <gour> dcoutts: just sent email to haskell list suggesting txt2tags :-)
09:31:15 <gour> dcoutts: although i think docbook & wiki are not the main barriers for haskell becoming more open
09:31:53 <Frederick> SamB, so I sohould do something like nonterminal = noneOf terminals ?
09:31:58 <Frederick> *should
09:32:55 <SamB> Frederick: well, you'd need to make terminals an argument.
09:33:05 <SamB> and it would need to be a list of Chars
09:33:46 <SamB> and if I were you I'd want to apply the NT constructor to the parsed char before returning it
09:34:46 <SamB> so, more like nonterminal termchars = liftM NT (noneOf termchars)
09:35:01 <SamB> after adding "import Control.Monad (liftM)" at the top
09:35:22 <SamB> @type liftM
09:35:24 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `liftM'
09:35:29 <SamB> @type Control.Monad.liftM
09:35:30 <lambdabot> forall r (m :: * -> *) a1. (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
09:42:33 <andys_> are there any good books that cover Haskell from a more monadic side?
09:43:09 <andys_> I've looked through a couple of books, and I can manage simple Haskell in things like hugs, my biggest problem is how to talk to the rest of the world (IO, also State, etc)
09:43:18 <dcoutts> gour, if only txt2tags produced docbook xml it'd be great
09:43:26 <Speck> @google takling the awkward squad
09:43:27 <lambdabot> Prelude.undefined :: a
09:43:27 <lambdabot> Test.QuickCheck.Batch.bottom :: a
09:43:27 <lambdabot> Prelude.id :: a -> a
09:43:49 <Speck> odd
09:43:56 <SamB> andys_: I don't know!
09:44:01 <andys_> is tackling the awkward squad up to date?
09:44:04 <gour> dcoutts: it produces latex from where you can get xhtml, pdf, what else is needed?
09:44:05 <SamB> I learned from playing around and stuff
09:44:07 <andys_> with ghc?
09:44:18 <Frederick> SamB, http://www.zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputmonad/liftM_f.html has no examples =/
09:44:27 <andys_> I'm trying to play around - I find the hardest thing trying to find the right function for things!
09:44:42 <andys_> still concerned about hGetChar :p
09:44:44 <gour> dcoutts: i don't know what is the status of docbook-5.x, but it was meant to be a cleaning (aka refactoring) of the big mess
09:45:40 <SamB> Frederick: liftM f p = do x <- p; return (f x)
09:45:44 <gour> dcoutts: imho, the whole xml is just invention to sell new tools and impress customers they are lost without them
09:46:00 <SamB> andys_: concerned?
09:46:10 <SamB> andys_: oh, that
09:46:18 <SamB> on UNIX, sure.
09:46:30 <SamB> at least, so far.
09:46:39 <SamB> on windows, you need to open it in binary mode
09:46:48 <gour> dcoutts: in other words, xml for saving config info etc. is ok, but for authoring...i did few lesson plans with a relatively user-friendly sgml (xml) editor, but soon i gave it up
09:47:02 <gour> dcoutts: back to lyx/latex
09:47:20 <SamB> Frederick: anyways, I'll demonstrate it for you
09:48:38 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "is it right?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13465
09:48:57 <Frederick> ive found a sort of a sample ive tried to repoduce it on my structure
09:49:35 <andys_> Sam: okay
09:49:41 <andys_> so how do you read unicode characters from a stream? ;)
09:50:51 <SamB> andys_: GHC doesn't actually implement that yet
09:52:05 <Frederick> SamB, ive tried with the construction Ive posted above without luck :p
09:52:12 <andys_> ahhh :)
09:52:15 <andys_> that answers that question :)
09:52:22 <gour> dcoutts: that bug which i discover while attempting to setup meld is fixed by droundy, but can you try
09:52:24 <andys_> okay, I should be okay then
09:52:50 <gour> dcoutts: to put the line 'ALL external-merge meld %1 %a %2' in your defaults and try merge of some conflict
09:52:58 <SamB> Frederick: take off the "function " in front of the type signature for nonterminal
09:53:21 <gour> dcoutts: afaics, it would be handy to add --output %o option to meld similar to kdiff3
09:53:30 <SamB> also, import not Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Prim but Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec
09:54:16 <Frederick> SamB, fixed
09:54:24 <SamB> now, try this:
09:54:26 <SamB> *CFG> parseTest (nonterminal "0123456789+-/*") "A"
09:54:26 <SamB> Loading package parsec-1.0 ... linking ... done.
09:54:26 <SamB> NT 'A'
09:54:32 <gour> dcoutts: and it could be something along the line of http://bugs.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169233 feature request
09:54:40 <gour> dcoutts: what do you think?
09:54:52 <Frederick> sad0ur, compiled
09:54:57 <TFK> In order to view .lhs files properly, I need a latex viewer of some sort, right?
09:55:22 <SamB> TFK: not really
09:55:24 <Frederick> WOW
09:55:31 <Frederick> it works!
09:55:40 * Frederick happy dances
09:55:45 <TFK> What do I need, then?
09:56:01 <SamB> Frederick: yes, it does. See, once you get the code to compile it very often works ;-)
09:56:26 <SamB> TFK: well, it depends on th .lhs file. but basicly you just need proper editor support, to see the Haskell code right.
09:57:54 <TFK> Since I won't be editing it, it would be useful to just pretty-print it. (Convert to an .html file, perhaps.)
09:57:57 <SamB> Frederick: anyway, do you have any idea how to implement terminals?
09:58:09 <Frederick> SamB, Im getting confident it is becomming more and more a matter of coding definitions and not using wierd langue tools
09:58:27 <SyntaxNinja> w00
09:58:41 <Frederick> Im starting to get the abstraction
09:59:00 <SamB> Frederick: yes, this is the kind of stuff we were trying to get you to do before to give you a feel for the language ;-)
09:59:56 <ptolomy2> Is there a function similar to groupBy, except that it groups even non-adjacent list elements?
10:00:16 <SamB> partition?
10:00:17 <basti_> ptolomy2: groupBy r.sort?
10:00:25 <andys_> does hugs have 'throw'
10:00:41 <shapr> Is that like throwing a kiss?
10:00:47 <ptolomy2> basti_, Considered that, but my data is equal on two different non-sortable elements.
10:00:57 <SamB> @partition odd [1..10]
10:00:58 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
10:01:00 <SamB> > partition odd [1..10]
10:01:01 <lambdabot> ([1,3,5,7,9],[2,4,6,8,10])
10:01:03 <Cale> andys_: yes
10:01:12 <ptolomy2> hmm.
10:01:21 <Cale> It appears to have all of Control.Exception
10:01:27 <basti_> hmm
10:01:28 <andys_> okay
10:01:39 <SamB> ptolomy2: partition what you want?
10:01:41 <SamB> note that
10:01:42 <basti_> ptolomy2: then do what SamB says
10:01:43 <SamB> > odd 1
10:01:44 <ptolomy2> of course, if I sort by, all same elements will be adjacent...
10:01:45 <lambdabot> True
10:02:03 <Frederick> SamB, a terminal would be a symbol that doesnt generate a production rule
10:02:18 * ptolomy2 needs to add about 5 seconds to his thinking time before asking questions.
10:02:30 <SamB> Frederick: I thought you said you were getting the list of terminals passed in?
10:02:44 <Frederick> SamB, yes
10:02:51 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: hiya!
10:03:35 <Frederick> SamB, well wtf a nonterminals function is basically the complement of terminal
10:03:42 <SamB> Frederick: The function's body could be that of nonterminal, with one letter deleted
10:04:07 <SamB> er, make that two
10:04:16 <SamB> but they are the same letter of the alphabet
10:04:38 <SyntaxNinja> hi shapr
10:05:11 <dcoutts> gour, re: xml. It's just that it's not realistic to change all of ghc's existing documentation from docbook to something else.
10:05:19 <Frederick> SamB, terminal termchars = liftM T (noneOf nontermchars)
10:05:52 <dcoutts> gour, I don't know much about meld and 3 way diff and conflicts. So I don't really have an opinion.
10:06:51 <gour> dcoutts: re. meld, try to produce some conflict in darcs and it should start meld with the ancestor file in the middle, and two other files on the side
10:07:09 <gour> dcoutts: tha'ts how it is supposed to be, according to meld's manual
10:07:14 <Frederick> SamB, but now I got a doubt terminal :: [Char] -> CharParser st (Symb Char Char) i wrong I know but I also know that I must have a pattern to check and it would be something like terminal is something that leads to nothing and is on the nonterminals list
10:07:50 <Frederick> in fact my last definition is wrong a terminal is something that doesnt leads to something
10:10:04 <Frederick> SamB, I might be missunderstanding the point but I think the checkinf for tewrminal should be terminal :: [Char] and terminal termchars = liftM T (noneof nontermchars) am I reight?
10:11:33 <SamB> Frederick: I have to go outside and do some yard work
10:11:50 <Frederick> SamB, no THX A LOT for today
10:11:59 <Frederick> wooop I meant NP
10:12:14 <SamB> Frederick: also, you can use oneOf
10:12:50 <exe> Hello.
10:13:23 <Frederick> SamB, worked!
10:15:14 <Frederick> exe, hello wb
10:15:34 <Frederick> Cale, are you around?
10:16:43 <Cale> yeah
10:16:48 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "guys do you agree with my definition to check if a given symbol is a terminal?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13467
10:17:04 <Frederick> Cale, I fell like Ive advanced a lot
10:17:15 <Frederick> *feel
10:17:52 <Frederick> Now I think my parser is pretty much done
10:18:01 <Cale> okay
10:18:24 <Cale> well, there is the bit about actually parsing -> and all that :)
10:18:46 <Frederick> but I still l confuse about how I can acess the lists
10:18:48 <Cale> that looks sensible, though you should be aware that it will eat things like whitespace
10:19:42 <Frederick> Cale, SamB worked me and we removed the |-> thing it was a bunch of parsing for a simple cosmetic  feature
10:20:36 <Cale> I mean at the concrete syntax level
10:20:52 <Cale> You'll be parsing things like S -> a S b ?
10:22:25 <Frederick> Cale, I want to parse soemthing like th samples here -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_free_grammar
10:22:42 <Cale> yeah
10:27:38 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "how do I make the test for empty recursive?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13468
10:27:41 <gour> dcoutts: re. xml, it is possible to write xslt stylesheet to convert docbook --> txt2tags
10:28:12 <gour> dcoutts: i simply cannot imagine writing in docbook, although i'm aware (many) people are doing it
10:28:39 <Frederick> Cale, in the end of the code Im trying to check for empty productions but an empty production is a recursive idea, it is something like S -> ? but also can be S -> B -> ?
10:28:52 <Frederick> can you guys give me some advice on it?
10:29:03 <gour> dcoutts: moreover, xmlmind xml edito has a plugin for something like txt2tags, called apt which can be converted to docbook
10:29:35 <gour> dcoutts: i know for that plugin (http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html) since i was looking for a xml solution(s)
10:29:42 <Cale> @type Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Char.char
10:29:43 <lambdabot> forall st.
10:29:43 <lambdabot> Char -> Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Char.CharParser st Char
10:30:04 <Cale> well, there's that
10:30:16 <Cale> if you want to parse a single character
10:30:20 <gour> dcoutts: and they (probably) stolen the idea from http://www.maplefish.com/todd/aft.html
10:30:58 <Frederick> Cale, what do you mean?
10:31:16 <Cale> rather than oneOf ""
10:31:41 <dcoutts> xerox, http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2005/11/11/more-opengl-goodness/
10:31:51 <dcoutts> xerox, I did that flash video thing
10:31:56 <dcoutts> it sort of works :-)
10:31:56 <Cale> you're not yet at the level of parsing productions, are you?
10:32:17 <Frederick> Cale, an empty production is denoted by ? in fact semantically I believe that "" would be no production wich is diferent of an empty production do you agree with me?
10:32:35 <Cale> I'm not sure
10:32:36 <Frederick> Cale, more or less, I have more enthusiasm than technique
10:33:29 <Cale> If I saw something like "S -> ", I'd probably take that to mean that S can go to the empty string
10:33:44 <Frederick> Cale, no if "S -> " i would say, S is an useless symbol since it has no production rule attached to it
10:34:24 <Cale> but "S -> " is a production rule
10:34:58 <gour> dcoutts: and 'aft' is (probably) even more powerful than txt2tags (verbatim..)
10:35:14 <Frederick> but a rule consists in a nonterminal attached to a set of productions
10:35:20 <Frederick> if I dont have a set of productions it is not a rule
10:36:13 <Cale> but that is a production, it's a production with an empty right hand side
10:36:56 <Frederick> Cale, those productions must be removed
10:38:13 <Cale> the only question is, is the right hand side really empty, or does it have the empty string as a possible target for S?
10:38:25 <Cale> (this is purely a policy thing)
10:38:50 <Cale> "S -> x S | " -- is this valid?
10:38:51 <Frederick> the policy says it has an empty string
10:39:15 <Cale> okay
10:39:26 <Frederick> Cale, can be valid but it is equivalent to S -> x S
10:40:01 <Cale> okay, so you'll need special syntax to denote the empty string
10:40:38 <Cale> "S -> x S | ", say
10:40:47 <Cale> (if you can see greek unicode)
10:41:01 <Frederick> Cale, In the input I will assume I cant have something like S -> xS |
10:41:28 <Cale> How will you write the CFG corresponding to the regular expression x* ?
10:41:37 <Frederick> it will be only S -> xS the other form has the same semantics but takes a bunch of expression
10:41:41 <gour> dcoutts: although with your script txt2tags should be sufficient
10:42:06 <Frederick> S -> xX | ?, X -> xX | ?
10:42:27 <Cale> oh, what's '?' -- it's not coming through from your client
10:42:47 <Frederick> or maybe S -> xS | x | ?
10:42:59 <Frederick> Cale, what do you mean?
10:43:05 <Cale> <Frederick> or maybe S -> xS | x | ?
10:43:14 <Frederick> ah
10:43:17 <Frederick> 1 sec
10:43:41 <Cale> well, in any event, you can choose some special symbol to denote the empty string, sure
10:43:53 <Frederick> Cale, this is what ive done
10:44:04 <Frederick> Cale, http://img280.imageshack.us/my.php?image=suggestion139ew.jpg
10:44:29 <Cale> yeah, I figured as much
10:45:13 <Cale> X-Chat -> Server list -> Click FreeNode -> Edit... -> Set "Character Set" to UTF-8
10:45:45 <Frederick> do I need to recconect?
10:45:54 <Frederick> *reconnect?
10:46:04 <Cale> possibly, I'm not sure
10:46:09 <Frederick> brb
10:46:51 <Frederick> testing 
10:46:53 <Frederick> is it oki now?
10:46:54 <Cale> yep
10:46:58 <Frederick> :D
10:47:02 <Cale> 
10:47:10 <Frederick> Cool
10:47:18 * Frederick remmind Calculus classes
10:47:29 <Cale> :)
10:47:48 <Cale> hmm
10:47:52 <Frederick> So back to my question
10:47:55 <Frederick> ?
10:48:05 <Cale> are you sure that you don't want to lift the empty string character as a terminal?
10:48:21 <Frederick> Cale, would it simplify something?
10:48:32 <Cale> hmm
10:48:56 <Frederick> Ive never had programmed in haskell untill 2 days ago, ive never created a parser until 1 day ago so I just keep going
10:49:09 <Cale> well, it is sort of a terminal, since you're never going to have a production  -> blah
10:49:26 <Cale> (at least, hopefully not)
10:49:37 <Cale> or does it have a special representation as a Symb?
10:49:42 <Frederick> No I wont
10:49:57 <Cale> what are TermSymb and Root for?
10:50:28 <Cale> (I can sort of guess what Root is for :)
10:51:02 <Frederick> Term Symb is useless I think now, root is the nonterminal associated with the first rule of the grammar
10:51:14 <Cale> okay
10:51:23 <Cale> maybe add an Empty to Symb?
10:51:25 <dcoutts> @seen boegel
10:51:26 <lambdabot> boegel is in #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #haskell. I don't know
10:51:26 <lambdabot> when boegel last spoke.
10:51:41 <Frederick> Cale, how would that be?
10:52:14 <Frederick> can I do something like Empty [""]?
10:52:29 <Cale> Well, normally I'd suggest something like  empty = do { char ''; return (T "") }
10:52:36 <Cale> but that doesn't typecheck
10:52:37 <dcoutts> Cale, have you seen the OpenGL version of the LSystem stuff yet?
10:52:45 <Cale> since you're parsing a Symb Char Char
10:52:53 <Cale> dcoutts: no, not yet :)
10:52:56 <dcoutts> http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2005/11/11/more-opengl-goodness/
10:53:07 <dcoutts> there's even a video :-)
10:53:28 <Cale> cool
10:53:33 <Frederick> Cale, wich would be a good approach?
10:54:02 <Cale> Well, it would work to just add a value "Empty" to the Symb type
10:54:17 <Cale> to represent the empty string symbol
10:54:17 <Cale> and then
10:54:36 <Cale> empty = do { char ''; return Empty }
10:54:41 <Cale> would work
10:55:12 <Cale> dcoutts: that is really cool -- what is all the streaking coming from?
10:55:53 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Parse error" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13469
10:55:54 <dcoutts> Cale, vnc2swf isn't perfect I guess
10:56:14 <Frederick> Cale, I think Ive missunderstood the idea or I need to import something more
10:56:34 <Cale> data Symb t nt = Root
10:56:35 <Cale>                | T t
10:56:35 <Cale>                | NT nt
10:56:35 <Cale>                | Empty
10:56:40 <Cale>                deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)
10:56:50 <Cale> empty = do {char ''; return Empty}
10:57:19 <Cale> empty is a parser which looks for '', and if it's there, returns the symbol Empty
10:57:48 <Frederick> Cale, it is not workign here im missing something
10:58:13 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "fooBaar" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13470
10:58:37 <Cale> get rid of your old definition of empty
10:58:47 <Frederick> Cale, yup
10:59:40 <Frederick> dont I need to add it to the data CFG definition?
11:00:50 <lisppaste2> Cale annotated #13470 with "fix" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13470#1
11:01:17 <Cale> however, ghc doesn't like that symbol
11:01:35 <Cale> I replaced the pound sign with a $ and it worked
11:02:02 <Frederick> oki
11:02:34 <Cale> ghc apparently doesn't properly support unicode in source files yet
11:02:35 <TFK> I give up :-( I still can't properly view .lhs files. Playing with lhs2tex now, but to no avail.
11:03:00 <Cale> TFK: you can't just run latex on them?
11:03:45 <syntaxfree> there are two styles of lhs.
11:03:49 <TFK> I tried pdflatex.
11:03:50 <syntaxfree> I use the latex-like one.
11:04:15 <syntaxfree> latex-like LHS = use \begin{code}  \end{code}  in the parts that are supposed to be compiled.
11:04:16 <Cale> what did pdflatex tell you?
11:04:48 <TFK> OK, I'm trying this on darcs.lhs (freshly pulled). Lesse.
11:05:24 <TFK> ! Undefined control sequence.   <--- then a few extra lines of unintelligble text, then it waits for my input.
11:05:36 <syntaxfree> you need \usepackage{listings}
11:05:43 <TFK> where?
11:05:44 <syntaxfree> otherwise, it doesn't understand \begin{code}  at all.
11:05:53 <syntaxfree> at the beginning, before \begin{document}
11:06:27 <syntaxfree> you might need something like \lstnewenvironment{code}{\lstset{language=Haskell,basicstyle=\small}}{}  too, I'm not sure.
11:06:31 <TFK> why doesn't darcs.lhs have it, then? people work on that file, no?
11:06:37 * kosmikus appears
11:06:44 <kosmikus> lhs2tex problems?
11:06:54 * syntaxfree becomes the local  LaTeX specialist.
11:07:08 <TFK> General .lhs problems. I just want to read the code, pretty-printed.
11:07:23 <syntaxfree> latex problems, I reckon.
11:07:30 <syntaxfree> can I see your file? Send it via www.yousendit.com
11:08:01 <TFK> It's just a fresh darcs.lhs from the darcs repo, but OK...
11:08:07 <syntaxfree> either that or paste it on a pastebot, together with the error.
11:08:11 <syntaxfree> second option is better.
11:08:32 <Cale> or point you to the darcs repo?
11:08:36 <Cale> @where darcs
11:08:36 <lambdabot> http://darcs.net/
11:08:52 <Cale> http://www.abridgegame.org/repos/darcs/
11:09:09 <kosmikus> darcs.lhs requires some preprocessing, iirc
11:09:22 <Cale> ah, there: http://www.abridgegame.org/repos/darcs/darcs.lhs
11:10:33 <syntaxfree> \input{features.tex}
11:10:37 <TFK> http://pastebin.com/425782 <--- seems to stop there
11:10:44 <syntaxfree> it's calling other files you don't have.
11:10:47 <syntaxfree> \input is like import.
11:11:35 <TFK> What are they and how do I get them?
11:11:53 <syntaxfree> they're parts of the text.
11:11:57 <Cale> if that was the problem, it would have occurred before then
11:12:10 <Cale> \haskell not being defined is the problem
11:12:21 <syntaxfree> well, normally, one pulls the whole darcs repository and compiles it / typesets it.
11:12:31 <kosmikus> I repeat, darcs.lhs is not supposed to be compiled with latex directly
11:12:34 <syntaxfree> \input would become a problem  sooner or later.
11:12:42 <syntaxfree> maybe darcs.lhs is already \input'ted somewhere.
11:12:51 <TFK> kosmikus, how should I go about it, then?
11:13:04 <syntaxfree> where can I get that file in pdf format?
11:13:07 <Cale> TFK: you have the whole darcs repo, right?
11:13:11 <TFK> Yup.
11:13:31 <kosmikus> TFK: just checking
11:13:42 * sh10151 downloads all the sicp lectures
11:13:56 <Cale> yeah, then you shouldn't be missing any of the imports...
11:14:03 <SyntaxNinja> Cale: got any logos for me? :)
11:14:17 <Frederick> Cale, if you would recommend a book to be BOUGHT on haskell wich would be?
11:14:19 <kosmikus> TFK: try "make darcs.ps"
11:14:46 <TFK> bash: make: command not found
11:14:59 <Cale> SyntaxNinja: hmm :) perhaps I should try some more -- do you have copies of the logos I did that night?
11:15:21 <kosmikus> TFK: which OS?
11:15:29 <TFK> Ubuntu
11:15:35 <kosmikus> and no make??
11:15:40 <TFK> :-(
11:15:48 * TFK scoutes Synaptic
11:15:52 <TFK> *scouts
11:16:48 <TFK> OK, installing.
11:17:58 <TFK> OK, running ./configure first.
11:18:03 <kosmikus> yes
11:18:15 <kosmikus> it'll have to compile some sutff
11:18:19 <kosmikus> stuff
11:18:28 <TFK> Why? I just want the code :-/
11:18:42 <kosmikus> because they build a preprocessor to run on the source file
11:19:12 <syntaxfree> feh.
11:19:14 <syntaxfree> at least OS X has make.
11:19:51 <sebell> syntaxfree: It does if you install the dev tools... just like every other operating system
11:20:10 <kosmikus> there's an easier way to get the manual, you know ;)
11:20:58 <TFK> Is the manual the actual, fully annotated source code in disguise? ;-)
11:21:00 <syntaxfree> is Ubuntu still doing the "people" graphics?
11:21:12 * TFK is make-ing darcs.ps
11:21:29 <sieni> syntaxfree: like the three naked butts one?
11:21:45 <kosmikus> well, the default configuration of that file won't give you any source code either ...
11:22:06 <kosmikus> but if the compilation works now you should be almost there ...
11:22:47 <TFK> I am compiling darcs in its entirety now, aren't I?
11:23:19 <kosmikus> I think so
11:24:33 <TFK> :-( surely there must be a better way! I mean, people edit those files, they have a way to work sanely with the code and the surrounding explanations.
11:24:33 <SamB> um, why do we need epsilon?
11:24:44 <SamB> can't we just use no symbols?
11:25:09 <SamB> in Frederick's program, I mean
11:25:53 <kosmikus> TFK: if people edit the files, they compile them anyway ...
11:26:36 <TFK> Excuses :-/
11:36:17 <TFK> OK, done, I think.
11:37:08 <Cale> SyntaxNinja: here's a scripty one: vx.hn.org/autoshare/Cabal-script.png
11:37:10 <kosmikus> but without any source code, isn't it?
11:38:29 <TFK> Apparently, no.
11:38:43 <SamB> kosmikus: at least it won't insist on building darcs first again
11:38:57 <kosmikus> ok, in darcs.lhs, in the beginning, there are two lines defining the code environment
11:39:02 <kosmikus> one is commented, the other isn't
11:39:11 <SamB> I think you need to change something in the root .tex file
11:39:13 <kosmikus> TeX comments are a % at the beginning of the line
11:39:21 <kosmikus> you have to switch the definition
11:39:21 <SamB> or .lhs, whichever
11:39:53 <kosmikus> SamB: yes, that's what I'm explaining
11:39:56 <TFK> \documentclass{book}
11:39:56 <TFK> %\usepackage{color} <--- this?
11:40:14 <kosmikus> no
11:40:22 <SamB> kosmikus: yeah, I'm lagged
11:40:22 <kosmikus> % \newenvironment{code}{\comment}{\endcomment}
11:40:22 <kosmikus> \newenvironment{code}{\color{blue}\verbatim}{\endverbatim}
11:40:30 <kosmikus> this is what it should look like ^^
11:40:52 <TFK> OK, done.
11:40:53 <kosmikus> TFK: you have the % in front of the second line, so move it to the first
11:40:59 * TFK nods
11:41:02 <kosmikus> then say make darcs.ps again
11:41:33 * SamB wishes HXT wasn't quite so big
11:41:50 <TFK> Hey, that was fast!
11:42:02 <TFK> I don't see the source code, though.
11:42:27 <SamB> TFK: yeah, I said it wouldn't insist on building darcs again
11:42:29 <Frederick> SamB, we have introduced $ just to turn parsing easier
11:42:53 <TFK> Ah, yes, pardon.
11:43:17 <Frederick> SamB, we have advanced A LOT I would say, I can check if productions are oki, I can check if  Ihave an empty production
11:43:28 <kosmikus> hmmm
11:43:41 <TFK> darcs.ps is still the manual, though.
11:44:03 <SamB> Frederick: ooh, cool
11:44:20 <SamB> TFK: but doesn't it have the code now?
11:44:44 <SamB> you were expecting the LaTeX to magically transmute itself into API documentation or code commentary?
11:46:24 <kosmikus> oh, I see that the preprocessor actually removes all the code
11:46:29 <kosmikus> this is strange
11:46:33 <TFK> If it has the code, I don't see it. (It was 108 pages, and still is 108 pages.) I want to see the code commentary, with the code, as they are present in the source file.
11:46:48 <kosmikus> seems like they *want* to make it difficult to compile it with the code
11:47:09 <TFK> Err, that's wrong - not "as they are present" but "pretty-printed".
11:48:14 <kosmikus> well, it's currently broken
11:48:28 <kosmikus> I could get it running, but it'll cost me some time ...
11:48:37 <kosmikus> you should ask on #darcs, and file a bug, maybe
11:49:08 <kosmikus> obviously, no one else is doing this ...
11:49:20 <Frederick> SamB, I will go take a walk and bb in like 3 hours to more ~4 hours of coding :p
11:49:37 <TFK> No one wants to study the code? o_O
11:49:56 <TFK> Well, I'll ask there, then. Thanks for the help :-)
11:50:09 <TFK> But isn't this a general lhs problem, though?
11:50:28 <SamB> TFK: probably, like me, they were unimpressed by the results when they DID get it to build the manual with code...
11:50:38 <TFK> heh
11:54:56 <roconnor> @pl \a -> f >>= (\g -> liftM g a)
11:54:57 <lambdabot> (f >>=) . flip fmap
11:58:27 * SamB wonders how hard it would be to add SGML support to HXML
11:58:36 <SamB> er, HXT.
11:58:55 * SamB bets it isn't TOO hard
11:59:10 <SamB> of course, I would cheat
12:01:58 <Cale> SyntaxNinja: http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/Cabal-With-Text.png
12:02:24 <Cale> I even made the letterforms myself :)
12:03:02 <xerox> Wow.
12:07:38 <Cale> xerox: you like it?
12:07:42 <xerox> Indeed!
12:08:24 <sebell> Cale: What's that for?
12:12:30 <Cale> http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/Cabal-With-Text-Light-Dark.png
12:12:39 <Cale> Haskell Cabal logo
12:14:26 <sebell> Cale: That's really sharp, looks great
12:14:32 <Cale> thanks :)
12:14:42 <SamB> where can I find dependancy HTTP-any?
12:16:02 <Cale> Inkscape is an amazingly good vector drawing program, by the way. It's cooler than Adobe Illustrator in a good bunch of ways (though there are things which it's missing from Illustrator too)
12:20:03 <tuomov> how about a lambda in lieu of the star? I think one might just fit the box nicely..
12:20:41 <SamB> ah, http://www.haskell.org/http/ has it and it is still pretty small
12:21:09 <Khisanth> what does *> do?
12:21:23 <Cale> a lambda might work, the box is already sort of designed to suggest a lambda subtly though :)
12:21:26 <goron> Cale: inkscape is still *very* immature. (but indeed it looks like *something*)
12:21:35 <SamB> tuomov: didn't you hear we were going for subtlety this time?
12:22:04 <xerox> Khisanth: I think it's some type-level operator, isn't it?
12:22:30 <Cale> goron: Yeah, there are things which seem unpolished, but that said, I've never had it crash, and some things about the UI are very smart
12:22:59 <Khisanth> hrm is inkscape a branch of sodipodi?
12:23:00 <SamB> goron: well, if a very immature program is nicer in a lot of ways than its mature competitor, you usually have something ;-)
12:23:07 <Cale> I really like how if you keep clicking on an object you work your way deeper into the structure, from group box selection, down until you're editing the curves
12:23:42 <Cale> There are some really nice touches like that.
12:23:56 <xerox> Cale: a designer friend of mine is suggesting to get a pre-made font to put a long the very nice looking logo ;)
12:26:22 <Cale> xerox: perhaps, but it would lose the nice ab connection
12:26:37 <goron> Cale: E.g. it is impossible to connect two things and have the arrows in a sensible place. CorelDraw can do these things. In the latest cvs version this is available, but it is not usable yet.
12:26:44 <soysauce> hm, if I import qualified Data.Set, how do I construct a Set object?
12:26:51 <soysauce> neither Set nor Data.Set seem to work
12:27:20 <Cale> Set.Set?
12:27:26 <Cale> Data.Set.Set
12:27:30 <soysauce> ah
12:27:35 <Cale> depends how you import it qualified
12:27:47 <soysauce> yes that worked, thanks
12:28:04 <int-e> > Data.Set.empty :: Set Int
12:28:05 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: type constructor or class `Set'
12:28:15 <int-e> > Data.Set.empty :: Data.Set.Set Int
12:28:16 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: type constructor or class `Data.Set.Set'
12:29:01 <Cale> > S.empty :: S.Set Int
12:29:02 <lambdabot> {}
12:29:13 <Cale> Data.Set is imported qualified as S
12:29:23 <int-e> @where lambdabot
12:29:23 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html
12:29:25 <Cale> (in lambdabot)
12:30:03 <xerox> > M.empty :: M.Map Int Int
12:30:04 <SamB> > M.empty
12:30:05 <lambdabot> {}
12:30:05 <lambdabot> Add a type signature
12:30:08 <int-e> ah. maybe the 'qualified' should be left out there.
12:30:31 <xerox> It would be cause of troubles with 'map', wouldn't it?
12:30:41 <int-e> right. it would.
12:31:03 <soysauce> awesome, works now, thanks
12:31:23 <SamB> wow, that is some bad lag
12:31:35 <soysauce> it's obvious now, but I didn't realize that I needed to add the ctor name on the end; for some reason was thinking Data.Set was the ctor
12:31:44 <Cale> SyntaxNinja: let me know what you think :)
12:33:32 <int-e> well, one could add another "import qualified Data.Set" for this purpose. but that's not nice either.
12:33:48 <Cale> soysauce: often people will import qualified Data.Set as Set; import Data.Set (Set)
12:34:16 <Cale> in order to avoid the ugliness of typing Set.Set a whole bunch in types
12:34:41 <soysauce> Cale - what is the (Set) part?
12:34:46 <goron> SamB: I haven't used Illustrator so, I can't tell.
12:34:48 <Cale> a list of imports
12:34:52 <soysauce> ah
12:34:55 <soysauce> that's rather neat
12:39:30 <xerox> Any OSX user here?
12:39:53 <Cale> I used to use it
12:39:54 <xerox> (I was wondering if Xcode supports Haskell projects, or something)
12:40:04 <xerox> Cale: oh, why did you get rid of it?
12:40:17 <Cale> The machine wasn't mine
12:40:21 <xerox> :-)
12:40:46 <xerox> I wonder how does it go with the Haskell coding on there.
12:40:50 <Cale> I had a dual 2GHz PowerMac G5 with a 23" Cinema HD display
12:40:58 <soysauce> nice
12:40:59 <xerox> o_O
12:41:03 <xerox> Rich :-)
12:41:08 <soysauce> haha
12:41:13 <Cale> but it was the university's :)
12:41:16 <SamB> xerox: they probably just use Emacs, or something
12:41:20 <soysauce> anyone with the 23" Cinema HD display is
12:41:27 <soysauce> wasn't that close to $2,000?
12:41:29 <Cale> yeah, I was using Emacs and gvim on it
12:41:47 <Cale> we had 6 G5 XServes too
12:41:59 <Cale> and gigabit ethernet
12:42:03 <Cale> it was fun :)
12:42:05 <xerox> How did they work? :-)
12:42:15 <Cale> quite well :)
12:42:19 <SamB> xerox: well, there are issues with .a files a lot
12:42:48 <xerox> Cale: I mean, how does the distribuited processes work?  It woulds fun
12:42:50 <soysauce> hum, does anyone know why (!!) is so fast?
12:43:05 <xerox> (!!) is not so fast, in my knowledge
12:43:09 <Cale> soysauce: it's not that fast
12:43:10 <SamB> various things don't run ranlib when OS X wants it run
12:43:21 <Cale> xs !! n takes O(n) time
12:43:32 <soysauce> yes, but there is a constant on the front
12:43:35 <soysauce> and that constant is low
12:43:39 <Cale> well, sure
12:43:42 <xerox> SamB: ouch, like?
12:43:49 <Cale> all it's doing is following pointers
12:43:52 <Cale> n of them
12:43:57 <SamB> soysauce: maybe you aren't using the result?
12:44:07 <soysauce> listindex n (x:xs) = if n == 0 then x else listindex (n-1) xs
12:44:09 <soysauce> this is also O(n)
12:44:12 <Cale> and possibly executing a small amount of code in order to build whatever list
12:44:21 <soysauce> but xs!!n is literally like 100 times faster for me
12:44:36 <soysauce> SamB - I most definitely am
12:45:10 <SamB> soysauce: maybe you aren't compiling your code?
12:45:17 <SamB> maybe you aren't compiling it with -O?
12:45:25 <soysauce> I am
12:46:53 <SamB> oh, it uses unboxing and stuff
12:47:13 <soysauce> unboxing? What does that mean in the context of Haskell?
12:47:34 <Cale> http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/libraries/base/GHC/List.lhs?rev=1.13
12:47:34 <SamB> soysauce: type ":t Int" in ghci
12:47:38 <SamB> what do you see?
12:47:39 <Cale> scroll down
12:47:51 <soysauce> ah, I see
12:47:56 <xerox> @kind Int
12:47:57 <lambdabot> *
12:48:04 <soysauce> @type Int
12:48:05 <Cale> :t Int will say Not in scope: data constructor `Int'
12:48:05 <lambdabot> Not in scope: data constructor `Int'
12:48:16 <soysauce> yes
12:48:26 <SamB> oops, I mean :i
12:48:34 <SamB> sorry ;-)
12:48:41 <soysauce> so when you use [Int] there is some magic happening underneath that wraps Int in another object?
12:48:42 <Cale> data Int = I# GHC.Prim.Int#     -- <wired into compiler>
12:48:58 <soysauce> yes
12:49:13 <Cale> data Integer
12:49:13 <Cale>   = S# GHC.Prim.Int# | J# GHC.Prim.Int# GHC.Prim.ByteArray#
12:49:32 <SamB> now, why GHC can't automatically optimize code like this, I'm not sure...
12:49:55 <soysauce> ah, hm
12:50:21 <soysauce> well, it's fast enough that it makes my code fly, it cut my run time in half
12:52:17 <SamB> anyways, GHC.Prim.Int# is an unpointed type, and as such doesn't ever get allocated on the heap
12:52:41 <soysauce> that makes sense
12:53:06 <SamB> this also makes it strict, and you can't pass it to type constructors
12:54:20 <SamB> well, there might be a couple of pointed types that get heap-allocated, but those would be array types
12:54:34 <SamB> s/pointed/unpointed/
13:31:23 <lisppaste2> bosie pasted "type problem" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13476
13:33:15 <bosie> anyone ? :(
13:33:30 <bosie> i hate when that happens, damn types :(
13:33:54 <arjanb> try using parentheses instead of the $
13:34:25 <bosie> no
13:34:28 <bosie> makes it even worse
13:34:41 <bosie> couldnt match [int] against [int] -> [int]
13:34:42 <syntaxfree> one thing I've learned bashing my head away is that type problems are never type problems, they just signal typing or syntax errors in your code.
13:34:51 <SamB> lemme guess... the ST monad?
13:34:59 <bosie> monad ?
13:35:42 <Cale> bosie: would you rather have a bug that only showed up at runtime?
13:35:59 <bosie> Cale no
13:36:31 <arjanb> bosie: my_index_thingie (fst (trenneStimmen strings ints)) [1..n]
13:36:49 <bosie> arjanb ah thank you
13:36:50 <Cale> bosie: you're applying the result of fst (...) to the list [1..n]
13:37:01 <bosie> yea just saw that too :( meh
13:37:31 <soysauce> just double-checking, but Array.array (0, 0) [] is legal, right?
13:37:33 <SamB> syntaxfree: only sometimes, they just come from the limitations of the type system
13:38:26 <syntaxfree> I'm trying to write a funciton that computes, approximately, the gradient of a function defined over a list.
13:38:37 <syntaxfree> I'm getting completely incorrect results, though.
13:38:43 <bosie> arjanb thx
13:39:44 <lisppaste2> syntaxfree pasted "a title" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13477
13:40:12 <syntaxfree> hmm. half of those functions are unnecessary.
13:40:27 <syntaxfree> act, bump,  h.
13:40:31 <syntaxfree> are the ones relevant.
13:40:54 <SamB> syntaxfree: what is "gradient"?
13:41:13 <syntaxfree> the gradient is the vector of partial derivatives of a function.
13:41:29 <syntaxfree> http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Gradient.html
13:45:33 * fworp thinks there is an XCode extension for haskell being worked on...
13:45:50 <sh10151> I know there is one for Eclipse
13:45:54 <sh10151> and one for VS
13:49:48 <sieni> If you have a function R^n->R^m that can be approximated by a linear mapping at a point, then you call that mapping the derivative at that point. If you have a mapping R^n->R that is differentiable at a point, then the derivative at that
13:50:25 <sieni> point is a linear functional. And since you have an inner product, you can represent that linear functional canonically as a vector
13:50:31 <sieni> that's the gradient
13:51:04 <SamB> okay, I need like a book or something!
13:51:22 <SamB> I'll not be any help
13:53:37 <tuomov> differential is a linear functional, derivative is value in the codomain... I think
13:55:11 <tuomov> a derivative to a particular direction is given by the differential
13:55:28 <tuomov> by applying it to that direction
13:56:14 <multi_io> syntaxfree: you're duplicating the element at position x I think
13:57:21 <multi_io> i.e. act f [a0,a1,...,ax,...,an] x gives [a0,a1,...f(ax),ax,...,an]
13:57:47 <fworp> yeah, i think the HOC project comes with some kind of xcode-haskell thing, doesnt look like anyones touched it in a few years though, and i think i tried and failed to get it to work with the version of xcode that comes with tiger
13:59:25 <syntaxfree> multi_io: I'll check that out.
14:07:16 <multi_io> oh, and you're removing the element at position x-1 :)
14:08:08 <multi_io> so the result vec has the right length, but a completely wrong value
14:19:12 <syntaxfree> hmm.
14:19:20 <syntaxfree> explain.
14:20:47 <SamB> @pl f g x = not (g x)
14:20:47 <lambdabot> f = (not .)
14:24:15 <fworp> @pl f x g = not (g x)
14:24:16 <lambdabot> f = (not .) . flip id
14:24:24 <fworp> scary
14:26:35 <wilx> eivuokko, are you here? :)
14:26:45 <wilx> Do you have the old #C++ wiki archived somewhere?
14:28:46 <eivuokko> Uhm, sorry, no I don't.
14:29:08 <wilx> Ok, what wiki sw was it?
14:30:53 <eivuokko> Uhm, UseModWiki.
14:31:11 <eivuokko> What you up to?
14:31:22 <multi_io> syntaxfree: act f [a_0,a_1,....,a_x-2,,a_x-1,a_x,a_x+1,...a_n] x gives [a_0,a_1,...,a_x-2,f(a_x),a_x,a_x+1,...a_n]
14:31:42 <Cale> what's up?
14:32:09 <eivuokko> wilx, I guess you could try if some archive site got the wiki archived or something.
14:32:14 <Cale> modifying a list at the nth element by a function?
14:33:14 <multi_io> act f vec n = (take n vec) ++ [f (vec!!n)] ++ (drop (n+1) vec)   should do what you want
14:33:17 <wilx> eivuokko, I think I can have some hosted on one box I administer.
14:33:51 <Cale> act f xs n = [if i == n then f x else x | (x,i) <- zip xs [0..]]
14:34:03 <multi_io> ok
14:34:09 <Cale> that works :)
14:34:14 <multi_io> ..too
14:34:17 <multi_io> :)
14:34:20 <Cale> yeah
14:34:33 <eivuokko> wilx, I'd recommend to use MoinMoin instead then, it is probably easier to admin and extened.  I had ready-made mods and some of my own installed there...it's not really that special wiki software.
14:34:36 <multi_io> syntaxfree's paste is up
14:34:37 <multi_io> http://paste.lisp.org/display/13477
14:35:08 <wilx> Ok, I am going to try it then.
14:35:26 <multi_io> shouldn't an array be more efficient for that, btw?
14:35:41 <Cale> a mutable or diff array would be
14:35:54 <Cale> an Array (which is immutable) wouldn't be
14:36:19 <Cale> with lists, you get to share the tails
14:39:04 <SamB> @hoogle Int -> (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

14:47:30 <multi_io> (well, the array implementation would need to support sharing arrays internally)
14:47:38 <SyntaxNinja> Cale: do you still need copies of the previous logos?
14:47:39 <multi_io> or so
14:48:39 <SyntaxNinja> Cale: I like the dark one and the script one.  you can hardly read the script one, but I kinda like that.
14:50:16 <Cale> Previous logos?
14:51:55 <SyntaxNinja> you had asked if I had copies of the ones youd id the other day. answer is yes
14:52:52 <Cale> oh, I have copies myself, I was just wondering if you'd kept them, or you wanted fresh copies
14:53:41 <SyntaxNinja> go tit
14:53:47 <SyntaxNinja> C-t
14:58:17 <Cale> oops, I'd lost the svg for the script one, but it's okay, since inkscape was basically able to recover the path from the bitmap version
15:06:47 <Cale> oh, neat, the dynamic offset tool is awesome :)
15:11:43 <SamB> @index popen
15:11:43 <lambdabot> bzzt
15:19:40 <Cale> http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/Cabal-Script-Plastic.png -- if you liked the script version :)
15:20:09 <sebell> Although neat, somewhat unreadable :)
15:20:13 <Cale> yeah
15:20:22 <Cale> it is fairly unreadable :)
15:21:04 <Cale> somewhere halfway between text and just a graphic symbol
15:22:05 <Cale> (I like my other one better, but I'm just having fun playing around with this one :)
15:23:02 <SyntaxNinja> :)
15:23:19 <SyntaxNinja> ooh, I like the plastic one :)
15:35:33 <syntaxfree> please don't est soap.
15:35:38 <syntaxfree> s/est/eat
15:38:04 <Spark> but its tasty
15:51:33 <syntaxfree> it's'not a good idea nevertheless.
15:51:44 <syntaxfree> please follow this friendly advice.
15:51:50 <syntaxfree> friends don't let friends eat soap.
16:02:47 <SamB> woohoo, I can parse the output of nsgmls when run over an HTML file
16:02:59 <SamB> now to actually build a document tree
16:06:14 <dcoutts> emerge -pv world
16:06:21 <dcoutts> oops :-)
16:10:35 <Spark> is that your root password?
16:12:29 <roconnor> @pf mu eps = modulus (f (eps/2)) (eps/2)
16:12:29 <lambdabot> mu = ap (modulus . f . (/ 2)) (/ 2)
16:14:50 <gzl> I installed hs-plugins, and apparently it's not registered (since yi complains when compiling); how do I register it now?
16:17:00 <roconnor> @pl \a -> bind (\g -> liftM g a) f

16:25:15 <dcoutts> Spark, heh. That'd be unwise. :-)
16:26:01 <syntaxfree> isn't yi a vi-like editor?
16:26:48 <palomer> I thought yi was lower level than vi
16:27:15 <syntaxfree> i remember yi as a vi-like editor. i never knew it was somehow haskell-related.
16:29:30 <syntaxfree> dons = don stewart?
16:29:41 <syntaxfree> wow, I thought it was a play on "cons".
16:30:03 <syntaxfree> wow, i've been talking to don stewart, haha.
16:30:06 <roconnor> @type \f -> Control.Monad.join . flip Control.Monad.liftM f . flip Control.Monad.liftM
16:30:07 <lambdabot> forall a1 r (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => m (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
16:31:09 <SamB> why are we eating soap here?
16:31:18 <roconnor> @type \f ->  flip Control.Monad.liftM f . flip Control.Monad.liftM
16:31:20 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a1 r (m1 :: * -> *).
16:31:20 <lambdabot> (Monad m, Monad m1) =>
16:31:20 <lambdabot> m (a1 -> r) -> m1 a1 -> m (m1 r)
16:31:37 <dcoutts> syntaxfree, yes yi is an editor written in Haskell. It can emulate vim, emacs and other editors.
16:31:40 <roconnor> @type \f ->  flip Control.Monad.liftM f
16:31:41 <lambdabot> forall a1 r (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => m a1 -> (a1 -> r) -> m r
16:32:03 <SamB> syntaxfree: have you not played with lambdabot yet?
16:32:17 <syntaxfree> samb: I never got it to compile.
16:32:31 <SamB> huh
16:32:43 <SamB> what did it say was the problem?
16:33:43 <syntaxfree> it actually compiled but it didn't ran.
16:33:47 <SamB> oh
16:33:56 <SamB> what happened when you tried to run it?
16:33:57 <syntaxfree> someone in this channel tried for hours getting it to run on a mac, to no avail.
16:34:01 <SamB> oh
16:34:04 <SamB> a mac issue
16:34:05 <SamB> huh
16:34:06 <syntaxfree> some error about an unresolved symbol.
16:34:09 <syntaxfree> actually, an OS X issue.
16:34:17 <syntaxfree> Linux/PPC would work trivially.
16:34:26 <SamB> well, yeah, you'd have to be insane to try to run it on classic...
16:35:33 <syntaxfree> a Mac can run pretty much any modern open source OS.
16:35:44 <SamB> well, true.
16:35:50 <syntaxfree> Mac = the hardware. Classic/OS X = operating systems.
16:36:09 <SamB> but I don't think of those OS's as "mac"
16:37:33 <syntaxfree> well, a Mac problem is a hardware-related problem.
16:38:13 <SamB> as far as GHC is concerned, those are PPC problems, though, aren't they?
16:38:22 <syntaxfree> nope.
16:38:37 <syntaxfree> GHC is compiling a binary for the Darwin OS.
16:38:39 <SamB> I mean wouldn't you have the same problems on an Amiga?
16:39:01 <SamB> if it was a hardware problem?
16:39:20 <musasabi> A missing symbol sounds like a software problem.
16:39:28 <syntaxfree> you might have a class of problems that is the same on a Mac and a PPC Amiga.
16:39:51 <syntaxfree> I rephrase, a Mac running OS X and a PPC Amiga running AmigaOS.
16:40:06 <syntaxfree> it's roughly similar to the class of problems that are the same under Windows and Liunx/x86
16:40:53 <SamB> except that windows and linux/x86 aren't each designed to run on a specific line of computers, which line is in turn specificly designed to run that OS
16:41:01 <SamB> just Windows
16:41:31 <eivuokko> Huh..
16:41:41 <syntaxfree> Darwin/OS X was designed to be multiplatform.
16:41:55 <SamB> well, okay. but not crazily so.
16:42:03 <syntaxfree> Darwin, the underlying Unix has been available for other hardware platforms for years.
16:42:05 <SamB> OS X wouldn't run very well on my box.
16:42:08 <syntaxfree> actually, very crazily so.
16:42:20 <SamB> it wants a 3d accelerator for crying out loud!
16:42:27 <SamB> thats not crazily portable
16:42:30 <syntaxfree> upon closing the deal with Intel, Apple had OS X running on a x86 in weeks time.
16:43:00 <Frederick> yo folks im back
16:43:03 <SamB> syntaxfree: you mean they didn't have it running on x86 *before* that?
16:43:24 <syntaxfree> maybe they did.
16:43:33 <syntaxfree> I'm talking about the public demo.
16:43:38 <SamB> still, what video cards did they have supported at this time?
16:43:48 <SamB> I bet not very many!
16:43:57 <syntaxfree> hey. but that's not really a design issue.
16:44:14 <dons> @dynamic-reload search
16:44:14 <lambdabot> module "dynamic" screwed up: module not loaded
16:44:22 <dons> @quit
16:44:28 <dons> @google haskell
16:44:29 <syntaxfree> @quilt
16:44:30 <SamB> dons: what was wrong with it?
16:44:40 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/
16:44:50 <syntaxfree> @papier-mache
16:45:01 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
16:45:22 <SamB> gota be carefull of that spelling-correction
16:45:25 <dons> looks like nothing. last night @google was timing out and breaking lambdabot, due to network issues.
16:45:37 <SamB> dons: oh
16:45:52 <syntaxfree> the fact is, they could have cut through work and ensured no one cracked os x for other pcc platforms tying it heavily to th e Mac platform.
16:46:05 * syntaxfree has switched to yahoo.
16:46:08 <syntaxfree> s/pcc/ppc.
16:46:20 <dons> hmm. syntaxfree, can you type: @quit for me
16:46:27 <syntaxfree> yet they made a point of writing darwin/os x so it was pretty much platform agnostic.
16:46:30 <syntaxfree> sure.
16:46:31 <syntaxfree> @quit
16:46:32 <lambdabot> not enough privileges
16:46:42 <syntaxfree> oh. I was snobbed.
16:46:49 <dons> so why did it quite before?
16:46:49 <syntaxfree> I require emotional strokes now.
16:46:54 <syntaxfree> make me feel special.
16:47:03 <SamB> okay, so for them, maybe it is portable. if by portable you mean "runs on anything with a supported 3d accelerator".
16:47:18 <gzl> syntaxfree: they had it running on Intel hardware from day 1
16:47:31 <syntaxfree> it's portable by design. it doesn't mean it runs out of the box on a dead hedgehoc.
16:47:53 <SyntaxNinja> @seen autrijus
16:47:54 <lambdabot> autrijus is in #haskell. I don't know when autrijus last spoke.
16:47:58 <syntaxfree> in other words, it's designed to be portable. maybe it's not portable right now. but it's a platform-agnostic design.
16:48:09 <SamB> yeah, I suppose even X requires a video card...
16:48:22 <SamB> (except the wierd ones)
16:48:27 <syntaxfree> unlike, say, Old-World System <7.5, which was tied to a proprietary ROM containing a significant part of the OS.
16:49:04 <SamB> true
16:49:09 <stefanw> dons, i've problems getting hmp3:   darcs: Couldn't read patch Fri Nov 11 11:21:58 EST 2005  Samuel Bronson <naesten@gmail.com>
16:49:30 <SamB> I didn't do it!
16:49:35 <syntaxfree> I never got lambdabot to run.
16:49:54 <syntaxfree> and thus my haskell hacker career ended :)
16:50:22 <wilx> Hehe.
16:50:28 <SamB> syntaxfree: well, you know, you could have tried the staticly linked version. if that was long enough ago.
16:50:45 <dons> stefanw,! hmm. i'll investigate.
16:50:45 <syntaxfree> it was a few weeks ago.
16:50:51 <SamB> maybe not then
16:50:59 <syntaxfree> dons even went out hacking for a long while, but I think it never worked out.
16:51:01 <SamB> if you had had on hand a time machine, then
16:51:14 <syntaxfree> maybe GHC is not fully posix-compliant or something.
16:51:27 <syntaxfree> and OS X violates some of the linuxisms it expects.
16:51:52 <dons> I think lambdabot issues where to do with dynamic linking on the OS. as lambdabot used to work until 6.4
16:51:59 <SamB> huh
16:52:16 <SamB> dons: but OS X versions start at 10.0
16:52:29 <syntaxfree> he means ghc versions.
16:52:46 <dons> lambdabot doesn't work with Mac Os 6.x ;)
16:52:53 <dons> afaik
16:52:57 <stefanw> dons: got it from ~dons/code/hmp3
16:53:11 <dons> yeah, I get the same error.
16:53:21 <dons> maybe I shouldn't be using darcs 1.0.4rc2
16:53:38 <dons> hmm. anyway, i'll fix it.
16:53:39 <syntaxfree> i wonder if makefiles or something expect certain linuxisms.
16:53:55 <syntaxfree> Linux's .so files are .dylib on darwin.
16:53:56 <dons> in lambdabot? no.
16:54:01 <dons> I don't use linux either.
16:54:15 <syntaxfree> really?
16:54:19 <syntaxfree> how exotic :)
16:54:35 <gzl> it's exotic to *not* use Linux?
16:54:44 <syntaxfree> c'mon, geeks, whip up your uname -a :)
16:55:11 <dons> $ uname -msr
16:55:11 <dons> OpenBSD 3.8 i386
16:55:42 <dbremner> Darwin 7.9.0 Power Macintosh
16:55:46 <syntaxfree> $ uname -msr
16:55:46 <syntaxfree> Darwin 7.9.0 Power Macintosh
16:55:51 <dons> $ uname -msr
16:55:51 <dons> IRIX64 6.5 IP30
16:56:14 <dons> top that! ;)
16:56:22 <gzl> Darwin 8.3.0 Power Macintosh is all I got.
16:56:30 <gzl> er, and
16:56:34 <syntaxfree> 8.30 = Tiger?
16:56:35 <dons> hmm, maybe I should build lambdabot on the mips. that would be a good test.
16:56:36 <gzl> FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE i386
16:56:43 <dbremner> dons - what model is it?
16:56:45 <syntaxfree> 10.4.3
16:56:51 <gzl> syntaxfree: 8.x is Tiger, 8.30 is 10.4.3
16:57:05 <dons> dbremner, can't remember
16:57:08 <syntaxfree> I see. 7.9.0 = Panther 10.3.9
16:57:21 <dons> it's 64 bit though.
16:57:36 <musasabi> OSF1 V4.0 alpha
16:57:39 <Frederick> yo folks im back to the fight
16:57:42 <gzl> syntaxfree: yep
16:57:43 <dbremner> dons - hmm, could be an Octane. I've got one.
16:57:49 <Frederick> SamB, ive completed some more functions!
16:57:49 <syntaxfree> I'm booting up the Gentoo box.
16:57:51 <dons> ah, yes. it's a dual Octane
16:58:06 <SamB> is .so really a linuxism?
16:58:13 <Frederick> syntaxfree, may the force be with us
16:58:16 <syntaxfree> Frederick: whip up your uname.
16:58:19 <Frederick> syntaxfree, new install?
16:58:27 <Frederick> syntaxfree, what do you mean?
16:58:28 <gzl> oh, I have this too.
16:58:29 <gzl> SunOS 5.8 sun4u
16:58:30 <SamB> or are you just calling it that because linux is the most popular of the platforms which employ it?
16:58:51 <musasabi> Now who wants to port GHC to each of these ;)
16:58:53 <dbremner> dons - mine is pretty old, but it works well enough.
16:58:53 <dons> stefanw, seems to work now
16:58:54 <syntaxfree> maybe. I never looked into the hood of open source BSDs.
16:58:56 <SamB> Frederick: cool
16:58:57 <Frederick> syntaxfree, what do you mean by wip you uname?
16:59:09 <dons> dbremner, ghc runs on it, btw.
16:59:13 <syntaxfree> your manhood!
16:59:35 <Frederick> syntaxfree, what do you mean saying it? Im not a native english speaker
16:59:40 <dbremner> dons - I'll have to try that out.
16:59:44 <musasabi> dons: on the IRIX machine?
16:59:46 <syntaxfree> @google uname
16:59:47 <lambdabot> http://www.ss64.com/bash/uname.html
16:59:52 <Frederick> syntaxfree, k
16:59:59 <SamB> Frederick: uname is not an english word ;-)
17:00:00 <dons> musasabi, yes. only in 64 bit though
17:00:09 <musasabi> mm tasty.
17:00:11 <Frederick> SamB, uname -r :p
17:00:34 <SamB> -r?
17:00:36 <musasabi> I haven't gotten it to work on Tru64*nix (OSF1)

17:01:25 <lambdabot> dons's karma raised to 15.
17:01:52 <SamB> and for some reason it doesn't report that I have a
17:01:59 <syntaxfree> Linux box 2.6.14-ck1 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Nov 4 13:36:09 PST 2005 x86_64 AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 246 AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
17:02:02 <SamB> Pentium II (Deschutes) GenuineIntel
17:02:14 <dons> musasabi, I think in fact i posted some binary bundles for irix on the ghc 6.4 download page
17:02:20 <dons> or maybe it was 6.2
17:02:35 <Frederick> I like gentoo because of portage
17:02:46 <musasabi> dons: I only have irix CDs, but no machine to run it on.
17:02:50 <dons> in fact: $ ghc/compiler/stage2/ghc-inplace --version
17:02:50 <dons> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.5
17:02:54 <syntaxfree> I like gentoo because of Larry the Cow.
17:02:58 <syntaxfree> Haskell needs a pet.
17:03:00 <dons> so it's not bitrotted at all
17:03:10 <SamB> I think I like BSD, but I need to get a new box before I can find out for sure
17:03:15 <syntaxfree> we don't want to leave it to the O'Reilly editor at the last moment.
17:03:32 <syntaxfree> what are your ideas for the haskell pet?
17:03:34 <SamB> hmm
17:03:35 <pesco> Can we have a bunny?
17:03:35 <gzl> yeah, I like FreeBSD.
17:03:44 <musasabi> Plan9 has a bunny.
17:03:47 <SamB> pesco: doesn't plan9 have that one already?
17:03:49 <Frederick> We need a functional pet
17:03:50 <gzl> too many languages use just some stupid lambda.
17:03:53 <pesco> Can we adopt Glenda?
17:03:59 <SamB> heh
17:04:02 <pesco> Or kidnap her?
17:04:04 <syntaxfree> Scheme already uses a lambda.
17:04:07 <gzl> yeah.
17:04:08 <syntaxfree> I want an animal.
17:04:08 <SamB> glenda with a haskell t-shirt?
17:04:11 <syntaxfree> ideas ideas.
17:04:15 <SamB> does glenda wear shirts?
17:04:26 <dons> hmm, --enable-executable-profiling with Cabal doesn't seem to use -auto-all ?
17:04:37 <pesco> No, Glenda doesn't wear shirts.
17:04:39 <SamB> I forget, and I don't feel like browsing the web, booting plan9, or searching the CD just to find out
17:04:44 <musasabi> http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/glenda.html
17:05:11 <syntaxfree> what does plan9 have to do with haskell?
17:05:26 <musasabi> It is from outer space.
17:05:30 <SamB> yeah, glenda couldn't possibly wear a shirt ;-)
17:05:34 <SamB> maybe we should take a hot-spring turtle
17:05:35 <syntaxfree> I'm thinking of a talking moustache.
17:05:47 <syntaxfree> turtle = "functional languages are slow".
17:05:49 <SamB> syntaxfree: plan9 is an OS.
17:05:56 <syntaxfree> I know.
17:06:01 <syntaxfree> from Bell Labs.
17:06:07 <SamB> and we just kinda like it, I think
17:06:26 <dons> stefanw, btw, as SamB pointed out yesterday, hmp3 doesn't check if files are valid music files yet, and secondly, errors msgs are printed to stderr (bad for ncurses screens). so expect oddities if you feed it bad files
17:06:56 <SamB> yeah. it sounds awful if you try to play the hmp3 binary ;-)
17:07:11 <dons> hehe
17:07:22 <syntaxfree> I wonder if the mac has something like /dev/dsp
17:07:30 <syntaxfree> iused
17:07:33 <syntaxfree> or /dev/sound
17:07:43 <SamB> and it might even go into an infinite loop first now
17:07:56 <syntaxfree>  i used to play binaries with something like "cat /user/bin/pdftex > /dev/sound"
17:07:57 <SamB> syntaxfree: does it have a port of mpg123 or compatible?
17:08:04 <dons> I ran hmp3 all night last night, and it worked rather nicely. very little allocs.
17:08:12 <dons> syntaxfree, me too!
17:08:23 <dons> cat foo.wav > /dev/sound used to work when I used linux
17:08:55 <SamB> well, they sound a bit different when interpreted as MP3s
17:08:58 <syntaxfree> if it was an uncompressed wav
17:09:01 <Frederick> I use xmms
17:09:09 <dons> SamB:: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hmp3.png
17:09:13 <syntaxfree> xmms is bloody annoying.
17:09:17 <syntaxfree> i used sox
17:09:23 <stefanw> dons: hmp3 works
17:09:24 <syntaxfree> I had a script called "listen"
17:09:30 <Frederick> syntaxfree, why do you think it is annoying?
17:09:49 <syntaxfree> I'd type "listen tall" and it would play all Metallica songs around.
17:10:04 <dons> stefanw! yay :)
17:10:05 <SamB> we should make hmp3 into a sane media player with plugins and all ;-)
17:10:09 <syntaxfree> luckily, itunes has exactly that available.
17:10:19 <Frederick> I jusr set to random and let it play
17:10:20 <dons> SamB, yeah, multiple backends would be good.
17:10:55 <SamB> Frederick: well, that gets old after a while. one giant playlist? I mean seriously, compared to winamp and foobar, that is not very good!
17:11:22 <syntaxfree> winamp/xmms are a flawed model.
17:11:28 <syntaxfree> foobar/itunes are better.
17:11:31 <Frederick> SamB, i have only 800 mp3
17:11:42 <SamB> well, maybe. but winamp with media library > winamp without media library
17:11:49 <syntaxfree> winamp even got around to emulating foobar/itunes mode, but it was contrived.
17:11:58 <SamB> and xmms ~= winamp without media library
17:12:50 <SamB> foobars problem is that it doesn't have enough plugins
17:13:04 * syntaxfree hugs itunes
17:14:29 <syntaxfree> if you want just a media player, use sox.
17:14:30 <wilx> Huh.
17:14:38 <syntaxfree> why put up with an annoying, nonstandard, radio-like ui?
17:14:38 <wilx> Winamps seems perfect to me.
17:14:51 <wilx> I have never ever had any need for media library.
17:14:57 <syntaxfree> i mean, what's the deal with trying to immitate a cassetep layer?  feh.
17:15:03 <Korollary> foobar2k > itunes (on windows)
17:15:06 <Frederick> syntaxfree, does it has a website?
17:15:17 <syntaxfree> wilx: so I thought befo I gave itunes a try.
17:15:20 <dons> syntaxfree, yes!
17:15:25 <SamB> what is the official lazy-man's IRC client
17:15:27 <dons> such uis are silly.
17:15:27 <SamB> ?
17:15:30 <wilx> Ituned did not impress me either.
17:15:34 <wilx> I tried them too.
17:15:35 <dons> SamB, irssi I think.
17:15:40 <SamB> dons: which kind are silly?
17:15:43 <syntaxfree> it's in the details.
17:15:47 <Korollary> I especially hate the rounded edges of the itunes window.
17:15:58 <syntaxfree> Party Mix and Smart Playlists are great.
17:15:59 <SamB> does AmIRC do this annoying thing with tabs?
17:16:02 <dons> emullating radios, stereo interfaces for a ui
17:16:05 <syntaxfree> itunes looks ugly on windows, yet.
17:16:07 <SamB> maybe I should just use that.
17:16:15 <syntaxfree> all windows on the mac are rounded, so that's more natural.
17:16:25 <syntaxfree> itunes should stick to windows ui conventions on windows.
17:18:52 <twb`> OK, so I've studied SML in school, and I've flipped through the Gentle Introduction to Haskell.
17:19:12 <SamB> I think windows needs better UI conventions, but without taking too much CPU or RAM
17:19:16 <syntaxfree> flip through htut.
17:19:16 <twb`> I was wondering, is there a document summarizing the difference between ML and Haskell?
17:19:23 <syntaxfree> @google htut
17:19:24 <twb`> Like http://dept-info.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~strandh/Teaching/Langages-Enchasses/Common/Strandh-Tutorial/diff-scheme.html does for the differences between Scheme and Common Lisp.
17:19:24 <lambdabot> http://myanmars.net/
17:19:29 <SamB> twb`: "ML is ugly"?
17:19:40 <syntaxfree> hmm. ML is eagerly evaluated.
17:19:41 <mauke> Haskell is lazy
17:19:45 <Frederick> SamB, I think so
17:19:48 <twb`> Well, obviously.
17:19:49 <SamB> "Haskell has monads, typeclasses, and is lazy"?
17:20:12 <twb`> The meaning of the : and :: operators are reversed, for example.
17:20:24 <syntaxfree> what are the differences between Miranda (Miranda is a trademark of Research Software Inc.) and Haskell?
17:20:35 <twb`> That's the level of detail I'm after.
17:20:37 <SamB> people use Haskell
17:20:38 <dons> Miranda is like old haskell
17:20:44 <dons> circa 1994
17:20:53 <SamB> dons: isn't it the other way round?
17:20:58 <twb`> Heh.  You guys think 1994 is old.
17:21:08 <dons> for a language it is
17:21:14 <twb`> I'm mostly a Lisp hacker :-)
17:21:15 <dons> or, in the history of haskell, it is.
17:21:20 <SamB> twb`: well, you try coding in 1994's haskell and see how much like todays it is!
17:21:26 <twb`> 1958 is old :-)
17:21:51 <SamB> then you can tell us whether it doesn't feel old!
17:21:54 <dons> a lot of the early 90s haskell papers are actually using Miranda
17:22:12 <dons> luckily haskell is now free
17:22:22 <twb`> dons: it wasn't before?  Ew.
17:22:29 <syntaxfree> so Haskell = open source Miranda?
17:22:40 <SamB> +9 years
17:22:59 <dons> haskell is always free, but i think Miranda had the more useful implementation
17:23:02 <SamB> and people have been rather busy in those 9 years
17:23:06 <dons> but haskell98 killed off the competition
17:23:27 <SamB> funny how so few people actually write haskell98 anymroe
17:23:48 <syntaxfree> you mean writing programs in haskell98 or writing "Haskell98"?
17:23:53 * SamB finally finds the app menu in AmigaOS
17:24:00 <dons> but probably only a few extensions are used daily, to h98.
17:24:27 <dons> pattern guards, concurrency, multiparameter type classes, ffi.
17:24:40 <dons> some of the newtype deriving tricks
17:25:20 <syntaxfree> how widely used Common Lisp really is?
17:25:42 <SamB> dons: don't forget the Heirarchical Libraries!
17:26:43 <syntaxfree> so. was Miranda an implementation of Haskell?
17:26:56 <syntaxfree> or did Haskell start out as a new, open source Miranda?
17:27:06 <Korollary> it was a different language iirc
17:27:10 <SamB> Haskell is a spec
17:27:16 <SamB> or something like that
17:27:18 <dons> SamB, ah good point.
17:27:21 <dcoutts> Miranda was comercial
17:27:34 <dons> Miranda was a commerical impl. of a lazy functoinal language, I think.
17:28:03 <dcoutts> Miranda was a language spec as well as an impl
17:28:11 <dons> @wikipedia Miranda
17:28:11 <lambdabot> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda
17:28:13 <dons> I wonder..
17:28:26 <dcoutts> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_programming_language
17:30:18 <dons> I seem to recall that some aspects of Haskell syntax were chosen so as to be not the same as Miranda
17:30:22 <syntaxfree> what are the differences?
17:30:22 <syntaxfree> miranda code looks like haskell to me.
17:30:35 <dons> have to remember which bits though ..
17:31:21 <syntaxfree> hmm. apparently miranda didn't have monadic i/o
17:31:29 <syntaxfree> i wonder what it did for I/O instead.
17:31:37 <dons> show/read
17:31:44 <dons> just like haskell did.
17:31:51 * dons fires up Gofer
17:32:45 <dons> ah Gofer, the only haskell-ish impl. that builds in less that 10 seconds
17:33:04 <galbi> hello, i know this isnt scheme channel but i was wondering if anyone here was familiar with SLLGEN parser
17:33:09 <SamB> how in the world?
17:33:13 <dons> Gofer Version 2.30a  Copyright (c) Mark P Jones 1991-1994

17:33:55 <galbi> anyone here familiar with SLLGEN parser?
17:33:58 <dons> maybe we should hvae @gofer just for laughs
17:34:02 <syntaxfree> hmm. "Prelude" .
17:34:03 <dons> or even @lml
17:34:18 <galbi> hello, i know this isnt scheme channel but i was wondering if anyone here was familiar with SLLGEN parser
17:34:32 <Korollary> galbi: sorry
17:34:45 <galbi> :(
17:34:47 <syntaxfree> there's a scheme channel.
17:34:50 <dons> Gofer does have type classes, of course. since  it's Mark Jones' baby.
17:35:20 <dons> :t readFile
17:35:20 <dons> readFile :: String -> FailCont -> StrCont -> Dialogue
17:35:22 <dons> !
17:35:30 <Korollary> ?
17:35:58 <dons> that StrCont looks a bit worrying
17:36:08 <dons> here's the prelude: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/standard.prelude
17:36:21 <dons> just so you can thank Moggi daily for monads
17:37:00 <SamB> dons: does Gopher permit file IO?
17:37:09 <dons> readFile ?
17:37:21 <dons> readFile        :: String ->           FailCont -> StrCont     -> Dialogue
17:37:21 <dons> writeFile       :: String -> String -> FailCont -> SuccCont    -> Dialogue
17:37:21 <dons> appendFile      :: String -> String -> FailCont -> SuccCont    -> Dialogue
17:37:27 <SamB> oh, I see.
17:37:34 <SamB> I'm not paying enough attention
17:37:40 <dons> getArgs         ::                     FailCont -> StrListCont -> Dialogue
17:38:04 <dons> that's haskell B (I think) for you :)
17:38:47 <dons> it's Haskell 1.2
17:39:12 <SamB> haskel 1.2 in ten seconds?
17:39:21 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "Lastest" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13484

17:39:26 <lambdabot> gofer ~> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/goferarc/
17:39:43 <dons> SamBb, yeah, since you only get the Prelude, and it's written in c
17:40:01 <Frederick> SamB, look Ive gone a little bit more ahead seem to be working now, btw with these functions I believe now I can make the core of the program
17:40:32 <ex_nor> UNSW pride!
17:41:03 <dons> hey ex_nor!
17:41:11 <dons> finally I get to talk to you :)
17:41:14 <SamB> Frederick: cool
17:41:14 <ex_nor> =)
17:41:18 <ex_nor> woah?
17:41:35 <ex_nor> who's what?
17:41:44 <Frederick> SamB, but I got some doubts again can you give me some more directions? I will need to do some recursion ahead
17:41:47 <dons> you're at unsw, right?
17:42:30 <dons> ex_nor, how'd you get into haskell?
17:42:47 <ex_nor> it's taught in 1A
17:43:01 <dons> right, are you at CSE?
17:43:33 <ex_nor> student, yes
17:43:36 <dons> do you do much haskell hacking?
17:43:40 <ex_nor> 3rd year comp sci
17:43:42 <dons> @version
17:43:42 <lambdabot> lambdabot 3p180, GHC 6.5.20050806 (Linux i686)
17:43:42 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
17:43:45 <dons> ^^ :)
17:43:54 <dons> maybe you should check out the map:
17:43:56 <dons> @map
17:43:56 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellUserLocations
17:43:59 <Frederick> SamB, I need to use my function that checks for  prodctions and use it to remove them but this will take 2 recursions, one to find the symbols other to generate the productions generated by its removal
17:44:06 <ex_nor> no, I've become very much a lamer at Haskell
17:44:06 <SamB> Frederick: okay
17:44:38 <dons> ex_nor, but you still hang out here?
17:44:38 <Frederick> SamB, lemme draf it in paper first
17:44:58 <SamB> Frederick: yes?
17:45:20 <ex_nor> dons: haven't taken it off my auto-join list, no =P
17:45:26 <dons> ex_nor, anyway, welcome, and good to finally talk to you.
17:45:33 <SamB> does anyone think SGML parsing would be a nice feature for HXT?
17:45:44 <dons> we have quite a few unsw hackellers here
17:45:58 <dons> as you can see on the map
17:46:23 <dons> ex_nor, you didn't happen to do 3161 this year?
17:47:23 <ex_nor> dons: no
17:47:49 <dons> ah, pity. that's a good 3rd year subject taught in haskell, all about implementing languages (that I teach ;)
17:48:07 <ex_nor> ah, I see =)
17:48:36 <ex_nor> I did 3151, 3421, 3431 and 9517
17:48:48 <ex_nor> I'm looking to get into the RoboCup team next year
17:48:50 <dons> ah, 3151, kai's course?
17:48:54 <ex_nor> yeah
17:49:08 <dons> what are the 34xx courseees?
17:49:17 <SamB> I'm getting "user error (Curses[-1]:waddch)" messages from hmp3
17:49:27 <dons> SamB, with the latest code?
17:49:28 <ex_nor> computer graphics and software of robotic architectures
17:49:45 <dons> SamB, maybe a bug in chopping the length of the file list.
17:49:50 <dons> ex_nor, cool!
17:50:03 <SamB> I can't pull any later
17:50:26 <dons> it got last night's patch though?
17:50:33 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "algorithm" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13485
17:50:39 <dons> SamB, can you re-get toug. the repo got corrupted some how
17:50:46 <dons> s/tough/though/
17:50:49 <SamB> they happen at the end of a playlist entry when I either go down TO that entry or up FROM that entry
17:50:50 <ex_nor> yeah, Kai is pretty cool
17:51:04 <dons> SamB, ah , I think I saw this.
17:51:24 <dons> ex_nor, he's a haskell fan too :)
17:51:31 <Cale> Kai Krause?
17:51:37 <SamB> Fri Nov 11 08:34:40 EST 2005  Don Stewart <dons@cse.unsw.edu.au>
17:51:42 <ex_nor> Eldinghart
17:51:45 <dons> nah, Kai Engelhardt
17:51:46 <ex_nor> or so
17:51:47 <SamB>   * UI rewrite, use new ui/ppr layout typeclass
17:51:52 <Cale> ah, okay :)
17:51:54 <dons> that's the last one, SamB.
17:51:54 <ex_nor> there we go
17:52:21 <ex_nor> yeah, he brought it up in lectures a few times
17:52:27 <dons> Cale, Kai writes your kind of papers, I think.
17:52:40 <dons> ex_nor, ah! I'm hoing he'll switch to haskell for 3151 soon
17:52:41 <SamB> dons: yeah, I know ;-)
17:52:53 <ex_nor> to replace MPD?
17:52:58 <dons> Cale, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~kaie/Kresearch.html
17:53:11 <Cale> I like the joke there :)
17:53:22 <SamB> I also see one at the end of the remaining time
17:53:52 <dons> SamB, ok. could you maybe jot down any ui bugs in a file, and post them to me?
17:54:00 <dons> I need to come up with some kind of QuickCheck for the ui I think
17:54:15 <dons> since it gets rendered to an abstract screen, that should be mostly possible
17:54:28 <dons> i.e. checking that the width/height invarients aren't broken, for one.
17:54:48 <SamB> huh
17:55:20 <SamB> that sounds nuts, but then so did using a lexer to handle keyboard input!
17:55:20 <dons> some kind of QC tests, I mean.
17:55:30 <dons> hehe. but that works nicely, doesn't it :)
17:55:39 <dons> and now there's even a paper on it :)
17:55:50 <SamB> what does that message even indicate?
17:55:55 <SamB> dons: well, it works.
17:56:13 <ex_nor> you taught Alex North this year?
17:56:13 <dons> curses functions fail if you go past the end of the screen, either to the left or the bottom
17:56:18 <dons> ex_nor, yes!
17:56:23 <ex_nor> and Andy Owen
17:56:27 <ex_nor> cool
17:56:31 <SamB> dons: I dunno how nicely, but you obviously haven't run screaming from the room, which seems like a good sign
17:56:34 <dons> SamB, so th emsg just says "curss threw and exception"
17:57:14 <dons> SamB ?
17:57:25 <ex_nor> cool, sounds like a fun course
17:57:40 <dons> ex_nor, it is fun I think. we have good assignments.
17:57:47 <SamB> dons: but these error messages imply that the cursor was in a fine place
17:57:53 <SamB> by their positions
17:58:15 <dons> hmm. can you post the msg to #haskell-overflow?
17:59:56 <ex_nor> anyway, I'd better actually study for 3151 =(
18:00:18 <dons> ex_nor, good idea!
18:01:48 <ex_nor> we haven't gotten any of our proof assignmenty marks back yet
18:01:56 <stefanw> why do these courses at UNSW have numbers and not names? I'm now at UNSW for more than half a year but still don't have a clue what course you are talking about ;-)
18:02:10 <ex_nor> so it's kind of difficult to know how well I'm doing
18:02:31 <dons> stefanw, they do have names, but sometimes they're long
18:02:34 <ex_nor> stefanw: they have names too... they're just really long to type!
18:02:45 <dons> so, e.g. 2041 == "Software Construction" == "SofCons"
18:03:03 <dons> and 1011 == 1A == "Introductoin to Programming"?
18:03:09 <ex_nor> 3151 = Foundations of Concurrency
18:03:17 <Frederick> SamB, did you see my last post? ive lost con again
18:03:18 <dons> right, so 3151 is just easier.
18:03:31 <wilx> Heh, why don't they call them SC, IP, FOC, etc.?
18:03:43 <SamB> http://paste.lisp.org/display/13485?
18:03:48 <ex_nor> especially in the case of 3411 = robo = Software of Robotic Architectures
18:03:48 <stefanw> yeah, 1A is the only course I know by number ;-)
18:04:16 <Frederick> SamB, yup I have a fancy description for it the teacher gave us
18:04:25 <dons> since we're comp sci people, numbers are ok, as we can use them as keys to our in-head map of names
18:04:30 <ex_nor> wilx: the numbers are official?
18:04:30 <Frederick> fancy = lots of letters and wierd symbols not defined
18:04:40 <ex_nor> yeah, and what dons said =)
18:04:56 <SamB> Frederick: where was the most recent version of your program?
18:05:24 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "lastest" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13487
18:06:22 <SamB> dons: your head doesn't expose Data.Map!
18:06:38 <dons> it exposes Map.lookup ;)
18:06:47 <hoopy> oh snap
18:08:15 <hoopy> > foldl (max) 0 [5,10,2,8,1]

18:09:48 <lambdabot> 3
18:10:00 <SamB> how long ago was usenet available in volumes?
18:10:21 <hoopy> by volumes you mean printed copies?
18:10:33 <SamB> I dunno!
18:10:38 <SamB> I doubt it, though.
18:10:51 <hoopy> i wouldn't have doubted it early on
18:10:56 <SamB> it would be an awfully inconvenient method for aquiring software!
18:10:57 <palomer> I liked miss october 1975
18:11:05 <hoopy> before black tuesday or w/e that was
18:11:06 <ex_nor> gah, use $!

18:11:08 <palomer> nice ascii curves
18:11:18 <syntaxfree> have you read Paul Graham's exposition on why Lisp matters?
18:11:45 <palomer> lisp doesn't matter.
18:12:43 <hoopy> you must use vi
18:12:57 <SamB> hoopy: he was talking about CL, not ELisp
18:13:21 * hoopy crawls away with tail between legs
18:13:50 <Frederick> SamB, can I remove the value entry of a map?
18:14:02 <hoopy> PEDANTRY!
18:14:09 <SamB> Frederick: sort of
18:14:34 <hoopy> programmers and pedantry go hand in hand
18:16:33 <SamB> @type Map.delete
18:16:34 <lambdabot> Couldn't find qualified module.
18:16:34 <lambdabot> Maybe you're using the wrong syntax: Data.List.(\\) instead of (Data.List.
18:16:34 <lambdabot> \\)?
18:16:39 <SamB> @type M.delete
18:16:40 <lambdabot> Couldn't find qualified module.
18:16:40 <lambdabot> Maybe you're using the wrong syntax: Data.List.(\\) instead of (Data.List.

18:16:49 <lambdabot> Couldn't find qualified module.
18:16:49 <lambdabot> Maybe you're using the wrong syntax: Data.List.(\\) instead of (Data.List.
18:16:49 <lambdabot> \\)?
18:17:14 <Frederick> SamB, in fact I cant just remove it
18:17:48 <SamB> @type Data.Map.delete
18:17:49 <lambdabot> forall a k. (Ord k) => k -> Data.Map.Map k a -> Data.Map.Map k a
18:18:06 <Frederick> cause I need to have a marker saying here ive removed  production so I may generate new productions when I remove  word
18:18:40 <Frederick> example A -> aBa, B-> I will generate A -> aa
18:18:50 <SamB> ah.
18:19:07 <Frederick> thats why I need a double recursion
18:19:39 <Frederick> first to check for the 's second to store the prouctions generated when they were removed
18:20:00 <Frederick> Does what I say make sense?
18:20:00 <SamB> well, I'm not sure what to say
18:20:09 <SamB> it sounds like it makes sense
18:20:20 <SamB> except I don't know what "double recursion" is supposed to mean
18:21:07 <Frederick> SamB, I will need 2 recursive functions working at the same time, double recursion is an expression ive just crafted but you can use if you like :p
18:21:28 <SamB> Frederick: you mean mutual recursion?
18:21:38 <Frederick> lemme google for a definition
18:22:34 <palomer> double recursion = mutually recursive?
18:22:56 <SamB> dons: how do you build gopher AT ALL?
18:24:07 <dons> gofer?
18:24:12 <SamB> Frederick: why don't you seem to have a parser for CFGs yet?
18:24:32 <SamB> you don't need to parse them straight into empty-less form!
18:24:43 <SamB> (thats probably impossible anyway)
18:25:13 <dons> cd src ; make
18:25:29 <SamB> dons: doesn't work!
18:25:35 <Frederick> SamB, dunno  Ive defined the functions of the parser but sure I need to glue them up somehow
18:25:39 <SamB> it complains about TIOsomethingorother
18:25:54 <SamB> Frederick: thats, like, the best part!
18:26:09 <Frederick> SamB, the hardest part I would say
18:26:13 <SamB> well, true
18:26:17 <SamB> but its so satisfying!
18:26:21 <dons> gofer 2.30a?/
18:26:27 <Frederick> lets go for it :p
18:26:52 <SamB> dons: oh, I need 2.30a?
18:28:14 <dons> SamB, that's the version I'm using.
18:28:16 <SamB> Frederick: okay, so you'll first want a parser that parses the stuff to the right of an arrow, I think...
18:28:20 <Frederick> well, to parse the grammar the onli restricion is that each production must have a single symbol on its left-side wich is already provided by the map structure so I need: 1 give a error message to the user saying that if I have more than 1 symbol on the left side that grammar is not a CFG, would anything else be needed?
18:28:21 <dons> I don't know how to build the others
18:28:32 <SamB> guess how?
18:30:06 <Frederick> well I would define something like (->) :: Symb nt -> [Symb nt] -> [Symb nt t]
18:30:20 <SamB> Frederick: well, you don't need to worry about that.
18:30:20 <SamB> parsec will do that for you!
18:30:29 <Frederick> hm
18:31:51 <Frederick> SamB, like in http://www.cs.uu.nl/%7Edaan/download/parsec/parsec.html Expressions Sample?
18:33:54 <SamB> Frederick: no, that won't work.
18:34:28 <Frederick> hm
18:35:27 <Frederick> SamB, do you know some link I could check for it?
18:35:27 <SamB> you could do |-> Symb t nt -> [Symb t nt] -> (Symb t nt, (ProdName, [Symb t nt]))
18:36:01 <SamB> Frederick: that parsec link might be okay
18:36:28 <Frederick> SamB, oki but I need something that accept multiple productions fot the same rule like  S-> a | b | B
18:37:49 <SamB> something like (many (terminal termchars <|> nonterminal termchars) `sepBy` char '|')
18:38:22 <SamB> actually, that arrow is not right...
18:38:35 <Frederick> SamB, yes it is a reserved structure
18:38:40 <SamB> |-> :: Symb t nt -> [[Symb t nt]] -> (Symb t nt, [(ProdName, [Symb t nt])])
18:41:38 <Frederick> it reports CFG.hs:62:5: parse error on input `::'
18:41:51 <SamB> oh, yeah.
18:41:59 <SamB> (|->) :: Symb t nt -> [[Symb t nt]] -> (Symb t nt, [(ProdName, [Symb t nt])])
18:42:24 <Frederick> Ive tried it too (cause I had it commented on the beginning of the source)
18:42:54 <Frederick> damm I had a blank space there :p
18:43:38 <SamB> x |-> yss = (x, map ((,) "") yss)
18:44:55 <SamB> > map ((,) "") [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
18:44:56 <lambdabot> [("",[1,2]),("",[3,4])]
18:45:17 <SamB> @type ((,) "")
18:45:18 <lambdabot> forall b. b -> ([Char], b)
18:45:28 <SamB> @type ""
18:45:29 <lambdabot> [Char]
18:45:58 <lisppaste2> Frederick pasted "bump!" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13489
18:47:19 <Frederick> so |-> takes a symbol and associates it with one of its productions then I generate the productions list, am I right?
18:52:03 <Frederick> ??
18:52:36 <SamB> all of its productions
18:52:49 <SamB> then you make a list of those
18:53:03 <SamB> and feed it to fromList
18:53:11 <SamB> @type Data.Map.fromList
18:53:12 <lambdabot> forall a k. (Ord k) => [(k, a)] -> Data.Map.Map k a
18:53:47 <SamB> fromList [("x", 3), ("y", 5)]
18:53:50 <SamB> M.fromList [("x", 3), ("y", 5)]
18:53:52 <SamB> > M.fromList [("x", 3), ("y", 5)]
18:53:53 <lambdabot> {"x":=3,"y":=5}
18:54:03 <SamB> erg. brain gone.
18:57:37 <Frederick> SamB, it is 2 am here Ive worked in this freaking project for 7 hours today I will go sleep and come back tommorow, than with more calm I can readthedefinitons and stuff oki?
18:58:00 <SamB> Frederick: sure thing!
18:58:15 <SamB> I won't likely be up yet then ;-)
18:58:21 <SamB> @localtime SamB
18:58:24 <lambdabot> Local time for SamB is Fri Nov 11 21:58:07
18:58:26 <SamB> @localtime Frederick
18:58:28 <lambdabot> Local time for Frederick is Sat Nov 12 00:58:15
18:58:30 <Frederick> SamB, what time do you usually show up?
18:58:54 <Frederick> btw we have summer time pc clock inst adjusted
18:59:15 <SamB> Frederick: well, probably sometime around 9:00 AM
19:00:02 <SamB> except on tuesdays and thursdays, in which case I might be around at 6:30 AM, but not likely to be much help then.
19:00:26 <Frederick> SamB, np cause I will sleep for like 6 hours +- now
19:01:07 <SamB> Frederick: well, I meant my 9:00 AM
19:01:07 <Frederick> than I wake up take a run, rat something and you will be probably showing up, Cale and ski are also helping a lot so I can fight in multiple fronts :D
19:01:18 <SamB> oh, Cale and ski, yeah
19:01:57 <Frederick> SamB, yes you 9 am is my 11 am I will wake up like you 7 am eat something go gym for 1 hour than I come back to the war :D
19:02:18 <SamB> ah
19:02:33 <SamB> are you sure?
19:02:43 <SamB> I thought you said it was 2:00 AM?
19:02:48 <Frederick> just a comment when Ive started this stuff and decided to do it in haskell I had an enormours fear of failure and stuff
19:03:00 <Frederick> 1 am I was worng
19:03:10 <sebell> whoa.. IRC is hard to read on Telnet
19:03:15 <Frederick> @localtime SamB
19:03:17 <lambdabot> Local time for SamB is Fri Nov 11 22:03:01
19:03:24 <SamB> sebell: even harder to log onto!
19:03:24 <Frederick> why do you use telnet?
19:03:38 <SamB> congrats in typing fast enough to log on!
19:03:48 <SamB> s/in/on/
19:04:42 <sebell> too lazy to download a client
19:06:01 <Frederick> sebell, do like a friend of mine, ppl didnt allowed him to run irc at work, so he uses irssi sshing his pc at home :p
19:06:17 * SamB teases sebell 
19:07:03 <SamB> Frederick: what does he do about the telltale visual appearence?
19:07:13 <SamB> transliterate the terminal into klingon?
19:07:32 <Cale> http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/Cabal-With-Text-Light-Dark.png -- latest version, see if you can spot the differences :) (just lots of tiny nudges)
19:08:08 <Frederick> SamB, what do you mean? his bosses blocked the ports, so they actually didnt go sneek in what every programmer is coding
19:08:24 <SamB> oh, the ports?
19:08:28 <Frederick> yep
19:08:36 <Frederick> Cale, number 2
19:08:42 <SamB> why do bosses do stuff like that?
19:08:55 <Frederick> SamB, they claim it improves production
19:08:58 <sebell> Cale, agains those are looking really great
19:09:00 <SamB> hmm, possible
19:09:21 <Frederick> SamB, but my assignment and you help proves they are wrong at least partially
19:09:29 <Cale> I think I'm done with polishing this concept. I might try another. :)
19:09:42 <SamB> but I think hanging out in the channels that they frequent would be more effective
19:10:06 <Frederick> SamB, how would they know what chanell is everyone in?
19:10:29 <SamB> Frederick: well, they could ASK!
19:11:23 <SamB> or they could hack up a packet sniffer, but only if they didn't have the ports blocked

22:07:29 <mwc_> Yeah
22:07:45 <sethk> mwc_, for the doctor, we can just use any of my code as a bad example.  :)
