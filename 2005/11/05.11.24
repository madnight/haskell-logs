01:00:05 <Heffalump> ok. Who put Java there?
01:00:09 <Heffalump> And can we kill them now?
01:01:33 * boegel whistles
01:09:52 <luqui> Does anyone here know how mutual recursion is transformed in terms of fixpoint?
01:11:15 <tic|school> Hrm, I do not seem to appeal to my monad class declarations :-/
01:20:12 <Heffalump> luqui: first make it simple recursion of a tuple
01:20:38 <Heffalump> x = f y ; y = g x becomes (x,y) = (f y, g x)
01:22:07 <luqui> hmm, and a tuple can be the type  (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> c
01:22:28 <luqui> that seems to work
01:22:29 <luqui> thanks
01:40:16 <mrchebas> anyone here using the ghc installers for mac?
01:40:28 <mrchebas> I would like to know what is the official way to uninstall it
01:40:36 <mrchebas> (besides rm'ing it)
01:46:25 <kzm_> With GHC 6.6's threaded parallelism - is GpH finally declared dead and buried?
01:46:35 <Cale> mrchebas: I'm not sure -- I recall it was a .pkg -- is there a standard way to uninstall those?
01:46:54 <kzm_> (And would it be possible to write a compatiblity layer for GpH code)?
01:49:13 <musasabi> GpH contains some nifty code.
01:49:44 <Cale> Won't the interface stay the same?
01:52:01 <mrchebas> Cale: I ignore it :/. I will google about it
01:52:40 <Cale> (my latter comment was regarding GpH)
01:53:11 <Cale> I hope par is still going to be around.
01:54:23 <kzm_> Hmm.. it seems like a very lightweight way to introduce a bit of parallelism, yes.
01:55:05 <kzm_> I.e. I can always add a par here and a seq there to get better performance - rewriting to use threads looks more intrusive.
01:55:44 <kzm_> musasabi, I looked at GpH at a couple of occasions, but it was always too outdated and/or difficult to get to compile.  In the end, I just looked for faster computers :-)
01:59:43 <musasabi> the serialization code looks nice
02:01:39 <araujo> Good morning Haskell'ers!

02:14:20 * kzm_ guesses most people will behave, but also fears that some won't.
02:14:35 <kzm_> And it only takes a few to invalidate any results.
02:14:42 <araujo> Hi hi boegel 
02:14:44 <boegel> dons: limits ? I'm not sure what you mean...
02:14:53 * kzm_ still thinks it is extremely cool (like all of \bot)
02:15:07 <kzm_> As in: one nick, one vote.
02:15:18 <kzm_> Or one nick, vote 0 or 1 per item

02:16:24 <boegel> oh, erm, I guess we could do that, but I don't have the time now... shouldn't be too hard...

02:23:03 <araujo> kzm_, C'mon, whitespace is written in Haskell :-P
02:23:21 <dons> joke. about lambdabot being lazy, so it won't fill itself up wih votes, it'll just thunkify the vote computation
02:23:42 <kzm_> ah.  joke.  I've heard about those.  (My apologies for being dense)
02:23:44 <kzm_> :-)
02:23:48 <dons> hehe
02:24:05 * kzm_ laughs.  A bit late, and he stops when he notices the weird looks.
02:24:20 * boegel thinks kzm_ is on dope or something
02:24:47 * kzm_ lets boegel think what he wants.
02:25:53 * kzm_ thinks boegel may have meant s/on/a/, but shan't have time to find out right now, since he must be off. 
02:27:34 <boegel> I meant on :p
02:28:46 <Muad_Dib> :(
02:29:03 <Muad_Dib> why o why do i need xorg to emerge latest ghc on my gentoo-sparc installation? :P
02:30:06 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, iy really shouldn't be a dep
02:30:29 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, I had no idea there were any other ghc users on gentoo-sparc
02:30:35 * dcoutts thought he was the only one
02:31:18 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, oh hmm. I guess it's because ghc builds bindings for X lib and optionally opengl
02:31:21 <Muad_Dib> dcoutts, : well, i got this old ultra 5 machine
02:31:41 <Muad_Dib> and its at home sitting there, and this maching won't do what i want it, so i thought let me try it on sparc ;)
02:31:45 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, ho ho, that must take days to build ghc
02:32:10 <dcoutts> it takes near on 12 hours to build on my 500Mhz ultrasparc IIi
02:32:37 <Muad_Dib> well, i have like a 350mhz
02:32:43 <Muad_Dib> so it should take some 16 hours or so :)
02:33:32 <ibid> what's the term for the expression e in "case e of ..."?
02:33:43 <ibid> it's not discriminant but something close
02:33:54 <boegel> ibid: guard ? altough...
02:33:58 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, looking at the ebuild, we don't depend on X.
02:34:02 <ibid> no, guard is the | ... -> part
02:34:07 <dons> scrutiniser?/
02:34:08 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, unless you USE=opengl
02:34:13 <boegel> ibid: yeah, thougt so
02:34:15 <ibid> scrutiniser sounds right
02:34:17 <ibid> thanks
02:34:22 <ibid> or -ee?
02:34:32 <ibid> scrutinee, i mean
02:34:32 <Muad_Dib> dcoutts, let me check
02:34:42 <dcoutts> @vote TopTenLibraries Gtk2Hs
02:34:43 <lambdabot> voted on "Gtk2Hs"
02:34:48 <Muad_Dib> but that would be weird, since i have no monitor, so why would i specify USE=opengl?
02:35:06 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, try emerge -pv ghc
02:35:15 <dons> the scrutinee is that which is scrutinised, i.e. the bit nside 'casee e of'. it's the 'e'.
02:35:18 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, that shows all the use flags
02:36:02 <Muad_Dib> dcoutts, i cant, since i am in a build now and cant open another temrinal since i have just one ssh allowed session
02:36:11 <Muad_Dib> however, i have the emerge -p ghc from before
02:36:48 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, you can ctl-C the build. It'll save time if you don't have to emerge xorg
02:36:59 <lisppaste2> Muad_Dib pasted "GentooSparc" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/13964
02:37:12 <Muad_Dib> i did an emerge --nodeps anyway ;)
02:37:18 <ibid> dons: iow, just what i was looking for :)
02:38:03 <Muad_Dib> but i am guessing xorg is on the dependencies of one of those other programs
02:38:32 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, yeah you did USE=opengl
02:38:46 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, that's why it's pulling in media-libs/glut-3.7.1
02:38:55 <dcoutts> which then depends on xorg and everythign else
02:39:04 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, I'd kill the build if I were you
02:39:14 <dcoutts> xorg takes hours and hours to build
02:39:21 <dcoutts> and if you don't need it....
02:39:39 <dcoutts> if you: USE=-opengl emerge -pv ghc
02:40:14 <dcoutts> as it is, the ghc build will break since it'll fail when it gets to building the OpenGL bindings
02:40:27 <Muad_Dib> yeah
02:40:36 <Muad_Dib> but, where does the openGL useflag comes from?
02:40:41 <Muad_Dib> it isn't in /etc/make.conf
02:40:45 <dcoutts> some default or something
02:40:56 <dcoutts> add -opengl to /etc/make.conf
02:41:07 * JKnecht senses a disturbance in the Haskel Force around the GUI.
02:41:19 <Muad_Dib> bleh
02:41:28 <Muad_Dib> if i want opengl defaults i'll take windows98 or so :P
02:42:47 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, emerge -pv is your friend. It tells you the use flags for each package you're about to emerge.
02:43:43 <Muad_Dib> yeah dcoutts 
02:44:31 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, well I'm glad to know someone else is using my gentoo sparc haskell packages.
02:44:41 <dcoutts> I thoguh I was just making them for myself. :-)
02:44:48 <Muad_Dib> lol 
02:44:54 <Heffalump> what sparc do you run gentoo on?
02:45:04 <Muad_Dib> but making them for yourself sounds like a very good reasno to keep on doing it ;)
02:45:07 * dcoutts uses a sunblade 100 from the department
02:45:36 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, the gentoo sparc team nearly laughed at me
02:45:49 <dcoutts> I'll go tell them I have at least one user :-)
02:45:55 <Muad_Dib> sparc64 sun4u TI UltraSparc IIi (Sabre)
02:45:59 <Heffalump> ah, and they let you reinstall it?
02:46:03 <dcoutts> then they really will laugh 
02:46:07 <dcoutts> Heffalump, yep :-)
02:46:22 <dcoutts> Heffalump, but no-one else in the department. I was an experiment.
02:46:46 <Heffalump> that failed? :-)
02:46:56 <dcoutts> not in my opinion :-)
02:47:08 * dcoutts has to go teach a ood practical using abc
02:47:09 <Heffalump> in theirs, though?
02:47:09 <Muad_Dib> dcoutts, if you have a petition, i will sign it so they will not laugh at you again ;)
02:47:18 <dcoutts> Heffalump, not sure really.
02:47:25 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, hah!. Ok.
02:47:28 <Muad_Dib> object oriented development using the aspectbenchcompiler?
02:47:36 <Heffalump> Muad_Dib: yep :-)
02:47:42 <Heffalump> oh, design, not development
02:47:54 <dcoutts> Heffalump, they complain these days because abc doesn't support java 1.5
02:48:05 <Heffalump> the students?
02:48:11 <Muad_Dib> we actually had Oege De Moor talking about ABC here a week or so again but i missed the talk :(
02:48:12 <dcoutts> Heffalump, and Bernard has got them all used to java 1.5
02:48:24 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, oh cool
02:48:31 <Muad_Dib> not cool
02:48:34 <Muad_Dib> since i missed it :P
02:48:38 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, well yes
02:48:57 <dcoutts> Muad_Dib, Oege De Moor is my supervisor and was Heffalump's supervisor too.
02:49:02 <Muad_Dib> ah :)
02:49:15 <Heffalump> (I wrote quite a bit of abc)
02:49:26 <Heffalump> dcoutts: ah.
02:49:27 <Muad_Dib> well, i hope to get started on a masters thesis about fop/sop/aop etc soon :P
02:49:36 <Heffalump> don't do it!
02:49:46 <Heffalump> or if you do it, do stuff about compiling for it, not using it :-)
02:50:49 <Muad_Dib> :)
02:51:09 <Muad_Dib> we'll see where i get
02:51:25 <Heffalump> oh, and I hear there's this great compiler you can extend if you want to do stuff about compiling AOP :-)
02:51:31 <Muad_Dib> but, at least now i know who to bug for questions about ABC ;)
02:51:45 <Muad_Dib> so you working on that one as well now? ;)
02:51:54 <Heffalump> on what?
02:52:09 <Muad_Dib> open compiler thingy?
02:52:24 <Muad_Dib> or is that ABC itself exactly?
02:52:34 <Heffalump> that's abc
02:52:42 <Muad_Dib> I'm messing names up :P
02:52:55 <Heffalump> I don't work on abc full-time any more
02:53:04 <Heffalump> but I do a bit of spare time maintenance and things
02:53:06 <Muad_Dib> the list of things to read is quite long, so i need to get myself organised 
02:54:10 <gour> dcoutts: this is on my friend's server..
02:54:21 <gour> dcoutts: Linux suganaka 2.6.6 #2 Sat Jun 26 13:38:58 EDT 2004 sparc64 sun4u TI UltraSparc IIe (Hummingbird) GNU/Linux
02:54:36 <gour> dcoutts: one (potential) user more :-)
03:03:11 <luqui> I'd like to pass an infinite list of Data.Uniques to a function... is that possible?
03:03:48 <luqui> oh, and I'd like the function not to return IO
03:40:03 <lome> I dont understand: can I split a text into words using `reads`?
03:40:03 <lome> ([x | (x, ' ':xs) <- reads "this is a test line"]) :: [(String, String)] gives me [] only
03:41:48 <luqui> I don't understand read, but I know there's a better way to split text into words if that's what you're trying to do
03:42:35 <luqui> oh, reads is trying to read a haskell string
03:42:53 <luqui> i.e., it will return something for reads "\"this is a string\" etc"
03:54:33 <gour> @seen dcoutts
03:54:34 <lambdabot> dcoutts is in #gentoo-haskell, #haskell-overflow, #haskell-blah and #
03:54:34 <lambdabot> haskell. Last spoke 1 hour, 5 minutes and 36 seconds ago.
03:54:45 <gour> dcoutts: ping
04:06:11 <lome> luqui: i can do it by another way, but i try to learn reads.
04:08:33 <gour> anyone know which distro is on haskell.org ?
04:14:34 <kosmikus> gour: redhat, I think. why?
04:15:12 <gour> kosmikus: lelit is trying to find out why tailor fails on haskell.org (gtk2hs repo) and not on my machine
04:16:36 <gour> kosmikus: so he asked me to find out what is in locales.build equivalent there?
04:17:20 <gour> kosmikus: there is also not locale.gen there, but i'm not familiar with rpm/fedora
04:18:10 <gour> kosmikus: he thinks that (maybe) glibc locales are not properly configured there
04:18:20 <gour> kosmikus: any idea?
04:19:40 <kosmikus> I'm not familiar with locales
04:20:32 <gour> kosmikus: ok, thanks
04:57:01 <kosmikus> what do System.Info.arch and System.Info.os yield on Windows?
04:57:19 <kosmikus> err, well, mainly the latter is interesting
05:53:20 <luqui> Haskell crashed my computer!
05:54:47 <basti_> how that?
05:55:29 <luqui> I entered the "exponential case" of let polymorphism from TaPL into ghci
05:55:43 <luqui> the fourth function took about one second to typecheck
05:55:47 <basti_> that crashed your pc?
05:55:48 <luqui> the fifth function locked up my computer
05:55:51 <basti_> :-o
05:55:56 <basti_> wow
05:56:02 <basti_> can you give a link?
05:56:10 <luqui> I'll type it up into paste
05:56:16 <basti_> great thanks
05:56:18 <luqui> @paste
05:56:18 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
05:59:29 <luqui> okay, it's there
05:59:35 <basti_> where?
05:59:45 <basti_> ah there
05:59:46 <basti_> ^^
05:59:56 <basti_> wow
06:00:35 * basti_ tries the bang line
06:01:11 <basti_> yes it rises like yeast
06:01:13 <basti_> i gunned it
06:01:30 <luqui> good thinking.  I let it go for 30 seconds before I tried to Ctrl-C
06:01:35 <luqui> too late ;-)
06:02:04 <basti_> I'm running it with priority 39 now
06:02:07 <basti_> lets see what happens
06:02:27 <luqui> 39... er, I thought it went from -20 to 19
06:02:42 <basti_> i dont think there's a limit
06:02:54 <luqui> ok...
06:03:24 <basti_> but its no use
06:03:25 <Saulzar> Hmm, unless I am mistaken there is no way to directly construct arrays via  a function from Indicies -> Value?  They all seem go via lists? Why is that? 
06:03:26 <basti_> it hogs the mem
06:03:52 <basti_> ah yes
06:03:55 <basti_> i see :D
06:05:13 <basti_> Saulzar: hmm i think because it is favourable for lazy eval
06:05:30 <basti_> Saulzar: did you consider using a map or something?
06:06:15 <Saulzar> Instead of array? I'm looking at storing an image.. so I guess array is by far the most natural.
06:06:35 <basti_> hmm
06:07:45 <basti_> luqui: i forwarded that to haskell-overflow
06:08:22 <luqui> okay
06:08:31 <luqui> it's kind of fun to look at the types of those functions
06:08:37 <luqui> well, except f4.  that's not so fun
06:08:41 <basti_> i bet the one or other ther will type something interesting in the following hours
06:08:45 <basti_> ^^
06:08:49 <basti_> yes thats what i did
06:13:31 <basti_> @where lambdabot
06:13:32 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot.html
06:14:06 <luqui> ahh yes... lambdabot... 
06:14:10 * luqui thinks devious thoughts
06:14:14 <luqui> but restrains his actio
06:14:15 <luqui> n
06:14:20 <basti_> LOL
06:25:10 <basti_> @seen calister
06:25:11 <lambdabot> I haven't seen calister.
06:27:35 <ProfTeggy> luqui, I get <interactive>: fatal error: GetMBlock: misaligned block 0x407ce000 returned when allocating 1 megablock(s) at 0xbff00000
06:27:35 <ProfTeggy> instead
06:27:57 <ProfTeggy> (after about one minute)
06:28:17 <luqui> wow, you let it run for a minute.  brave
06:28:23 <luqui> hmm, what arch?
06:28:40 <ProfTeggy> It was on a remote box at my old university ;-)
06:28:47 <ProfTeggy> Linux, 32 bit, 2 GB RAM
06:29:10 <basti_> cool.
06:29:35 <luqui> so it still died... it seems like having less ram would only speed up the process
06:29:48 <luqui> s/still//
06:30:43 <luqui> but I don't really know what happens at the OS/hardware level when you run out of memory
06:31:31 <basti_> well first the os starts swapping
06:31:44 <basti_> it puts untouched stuff onto the hd
06:31:50 <basti_> and reads it back when requested
06:31:52 <basti_> that takes TIME
06:32:12 <luqui> hmm, and if a program is constantly swapping out a lot of its memory
06:32:19 <luqui> that doesn't leave much left for XMMS
06:32:21 <luqui> or X
06:32:27 <luqui> thus, crash
06:32:31 <luqui> ?
06:33:15 <ProfTeggy> In Linux, the OOM killer is activated (based on a heuristical decision by the kernel)
06:33:38 <droundy> It depends how much swap you've got.  I've done some pretty crazy stuff (think linux kernel repository), but if you've got more than 4G swap you pretty much can't kill your box.  (although you can hang it for a few hours or so)
06:35:33 <luqui> let's see, that type expression grows like 2^2^n
06:36:02 <luqui> so, falsely assuming that each position takes up one byte, you need 4G of memory to type f5
06:36:26 <luqui> of course, the actual number is a lot higher than that
06:54:08 <kzm> How much extra overhead is to be expected when limiting heap (+RTS -M)?
06:54:30 <kzm> My process is limited to -M600M, but is currently consuming close to a Gb.
06:54:37 <musasabi> kzm: do a simple measurement (depends on the app)
06:55:18 <JaffaCake> kzm: -M only limits GHC's heap size, if you have other memory requirements (eg. malloc or mmap) these aren't counted
06:56:38 <xerox> JaffaCake: howdy, how long :-)
06:56:40 <kzm> Hmm...no explicit allocations (and AFAIK, nothing suspect in any libraries I use)
06:56:55 <kzm> Stack is just default size (i.e. small, I think)
06:57:04 <JaffaCake> xerox: hi there, been busy :)
06:57:31 <JaffaCake> kzm: you using any other GC options?
06:57:33 <xerox> JaffaCake: heh, people were asking why did you stop hang out, I hope it's all right :-)
06:57:39 <kzm> The way I remembered it, -M would be fairly accurate to size (from 'top').
06:57:41 <xerox> hang out here, even
06:58:13 <kzm> JaffaCake, no other RTS options (and not compiled with profiling)
06:58:15 <JaffaCake> xerox: also, I have a problem where GAIM interacts badly with the virtual desktop thingy I use, and sometimes it doesn't work
06:58:49 <JaffaCake> kzm: then -M *should* be reasonably accurate
06:59:30 <JaffaCake> it is possible for it to use more memory temporarily, but it should quickly fail with out of memory
06:59:31 <kzm> I'm 90% done now, and slightly over 1Gb (= physical RAM) - still getting 99% CPU, so *maybe* it will work :-)
06:59:59 <kzm> Bug, then?
07:00:12 <xerox> JaffaCake: Hmpf.  If you use Emacs for something you could try its irc clients too.  Circe it's pretty nice.
07:01:01 <JaffaCake> I like the way GAIM makes a noise when someone mentions your nick, probably couldn't get emacs to do that
07:01:27 <xerox> I think Emacs could even speak loud what that 'someone' tells you ;-)
07:01:29 <kzm> couldn't?  Not sure that is a word in the dictionary of a lisp engine :-)
07:02:01 <JaffaCake> well true, but life's too short to figure out how to do it :)
07:02:14 <kzm>  1977 ketil     25   0 1236m 713m  468 R 99.9 71.2  25:14.71 rb
07:02:20 <Heffalump> does it make lots of noise if we go "JaffaCake JaffaCake JaffaCake"? :-)
07:02:30 <kzm> (from "top" output, rb is run +RTS -M600M
07:02:44 <kzm> (and the 1236 is "virt", 713 is rss)
07:02:53 <xerox> Agreed.  Though, there also is erc-osd, which writes on the screen with big red (configurable) letters in some (configurable) place.
07:03:44 <xerox> Anyway, see you later!
07:04:30 <kzm> JaffaCake, how compatible is threaded 'par' with distributed?
07:04:41 <kzm> (And is distributed (PVM) GpC alive still?)
07:05:23 <kzm> Very happy to see that par is supported, I asked about it earlier today here, but didn't occur to me to check mail for a reply :-)
07:05:35 <JaffaCake> the programmer interfaces are identical - I don't have a good grasp of whether you need to annotate differently for each environment though
07:05:58 <JaffaCake> in terms of tuning for good performance/parallelism, I mean
07:06:16 <kzm> (virt is now 1350Mb - but -M is doing something, without the app started thrashing badly)
07:06:35 <CosmicRay> good morning jaffacake
07:06:47 <kzm> me neither.  But I might get it.  Grasp, that is. :-)
07:07:07 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: is there anything I can do to help with the AIX bugs I reported yesterday?
07:07:11 <JaffaCake> hey CosmicRay
07:07:13 <kzm> Must run. Later.
07:07:27 <JaffaCake> bye
07:07:53 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: I haven't looked in detail yet
07:07:57 <CosmicRay> ok
07:08:19 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: any progress on darcs'ing GHC? :)
07:08:28 <CosmicRay> oh, I've been meaning to ask you about that.
07:08:36 <droundy> JaffaCake: Is it likely that the "My brain just exploded." error when using let to bind an existentially-quantified constructor is going to go away? It's a bit annoying to have to always stick bindings in a monad or case statement.
07:08:46 <CosmicRay> I think I sent you a follow-up question or two to your plan....
07:08:47 <CosmicRay> let me see...
07:09:02 <JaffaCake> droundy: my impression is its unlikely
07:09:14 <droundy> Is it a hard problem, or just not an interesting one?
07:09:32 <JaffaCake> defintely hard, and might be interesting depending on who you ask :)
07:09:43 <droundy> :)
07:10:00 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: oh, I don't remember seeing anything
07:10:13 <JaffaCake> maybe it got eaten by spam filter, I'll check
07:10:58 <dcoutts> gour, pong
07:11:39 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: what list did the most recent discussion occur on?
07:11:44 <gour> dcoutts: hi
07:11:54 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: I think I sent something to cvs-ghc last
07:12:01 <int-e> is there a left associative version of $! ?
07:12:22 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay:  http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/cvs-ghc/2005-November/027174.html
07:12:30 <gour> dcoutts: i was trying to help lelit debug that tailor encode errror, can you come to tailor?
07:13:54 <CosmicRay> ok well either the moderator filter ate my reply or I never sent one ;-)
07:14:04 <CosmicRay> so my question is basically on the ghc repo
07:14:14 <CosmicRay> I'm a little confused what "the files in fptools" means
07:14:18 <CosmicRay> do you mean fptools/ghc?
07:15:05 <CosmicRay> also the other comment was that switching the direction of the sync may not be practical.
07:15:10 <JaffaCake> I mean the files at the top level of fptools, i.e. not in a subdirectory
07:15:16 <CosmicRay> ah.
07:15:19 <JaffaCake> eg. Makefile, configure.ac, aclocal.m4 etc.
07:15:26 <CosmicRay> ok.
07:16:05 <JaffaCake> ah, what goes wrong with switching the direction?
07:16:10 <CosmicRay> lelit: ping
07:16:21 <JaffaCake> I think it was droundy that suggested it originally
07:16:42 <lelit> hi CosmicRay 
07:16:45 <CosmicRay> lelit is the author of tailor, so let's try to ask him.  my impression is that it is fragile
07:16:53 <CosmicRay> lelit: couple of tailor questions for you
07:17:14 <CosmicRay> lelit: first off, is there any way, when doing cvs -> darcs, to tell it to include only certain files and directory trees?
07:17:48 <CosmicRay> so basically, we'll have a cvsroot, but want to sync a subset of it into darcs.
07:18:03 <JaffaCake> yup
07:18:20 <CosmicRay> lelit: and this isn't necessarily at module boundaries either
07:19:10 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: where on cvs.h.o do you want this to go?
07:19:57 <lelit> CosmicRay, sure: you even have the opportunity of using an arbitrary filter
07:20:03 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: /home/darcs/ghc, and /home/darcs/libraries etc.
07:20:11 <CosmicRay> lelit: oh, nice
07:20:24 <CosmicRay> lelit: this is documented somewhere, right? ;-)
07:20:44 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: are you sure?  that happens to also be the root fs, and has only 15G free... /srv, where CVS is, has 109G free
07:20:47 <lelit> CosmicRay, yes, in two places, the main is the code :)
07:21:02 <CosmicRay> I don't remember exactly how big this is, it will probably fit.
07:21:05 <lelit> the other in the README
07:21:07 <CosmicRay> I guess it can go there to start for
07:21:12 <CosmicRay> lelit: can you give me a string to grep for? ;-)
07:21:17 <lelit> and to be exact, there's a third, in the test
07:21:18 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: ah, I'll take a look
07:21:46 <CosmicRay> s/start for/start with/
07:22:35 <lelit> CosmicRay, you are looking for "before-commit" and "after-commit" hooks
07:23:21 <CosmicRay> ok.
07:23:26 <CosmicRay> looks good.
07:23:31 <lelit> the former is a sequence of functions, empty by default, that takes a changeset and return an "adapted" equivalent (so you can tweak authors, files, changelog...)
07:23:46 <lelit> if one of them return None, the changeset is skipped
07:23:59 <CosmicRay> lelit: next question..   we are looking to convert a large cvs repository to darcs.  after conversion, the darcs repo would be read-only for a time, and changes in cvs would be synced to darcs.
07:24:11 <CosmicRay> lelit: this much I know how to do now, I believe.
07:24:33 <CosmicRay> lelit: question is, is it possible to reverse the direction of the syncing at some point?  and how easy and reliable is that?
07:25:17 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: is cvs.h.o grunty enough that I won't bother others if I run tailor there, or do I still need to rsync things down to my box and run them locally?
07:26:00 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: one other thing -- darcs 1.0.4 might be nice to have on that box.
07:26:22 <lelit> CosmicRay, it should be definitely possible and easy. The trickery is in getting full two way sync
07:26:32 <CosmicRay> lelit: I think we can do without that.
07:27:31 <lelit> then it's really simple
07:27:59 <lelit> or tailor should be fixed to make that simple :)
07:28:02 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: ok then, I'm willing to run the sync that way if lelit is willing to help me when trouble arises ;-)
07:29:44 <CosmicRay> OK.
07:29:57 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I think that is everything I need to begin hacking locally.
07:30:26 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I will probably start work on this next week.
07:31:11 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: ok I just fired off a msg to the cvs.h.o folk
07:31:44 <ibid> CosmicRay: got my mail?
07:32:29 <CosmicRay> about your blog?
07:32:30 <lelit> CosmicRay, you're welcome. I usually hang off #tailor, join me there or just invite me...
07:32:38 <CosmicRay> lelit: thanks much
07:32:45 <CosmicRay> lelit: tailor is great, btw.
07:32:50 <lelit> thanks :)
07:32:52 <CosmicRay> lelit: so are you interested in haskell? ;-)
07:33:15 <ibid> CosmicRay: y
07:33:31 <CosmicRay> ibid: yup, I'll get to that later today.  thanks for letting me know.
07:33:34 <ibid> ok
07:33:37 <lelit> I am. But I had no success in focusing my attention on it for the required minimum time :)
07:33:54 * ibid noticed a rather persistent drupal pingin the old feed, that's what reminded me :)
07:34:00 <CosmicRay> hehe
07:34:29 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I will probably tackle the smaller repos first, and do ghc last, fwiw.
07:34:35 <ibid> sequence did not get the planet ibid effect?
07:34:38 <ibid> bah
07:34:43 * ibid vanishes, bbl
07:35:08 * CosmicRay must disappear as well.  thanks jaffacake and lelit.
07:35:13 <lelit> I'd really enjoy learning the basics, and now and then I try to read darcs source/patches... but as somebody suggested me, "shutdown IRC for a month, and rename the python interpreter..." :-)
07:51:27 <xerox> np: The Moody Blues - Ride My See-Saw
08:12:38 <musasabi> HList is not playing with me today:
08:13:01 <musasabi> "(_0 .=. True .*. emptyRecord) # _0" results in the error: " No instance for (HasField (Proxy N0) HNil v)"
08:13:22 <musasabi> And _0 :: Proxy N0, so that should be alright also.
08:14:07 * musasabi suspects this is just a stupid error

08:36:44 <tic|school> Hi there. I'm having trouble with bind.  Could anyone help me? http://rafb.net/paste/results/fK4jdI39.html
08:40:13 <kosmikus> tic|school: I'd expect you need to use k somewhere ...
08:41:52 <tic|school> kosmikus, I mis-typed that. Should say return (q' >>= k) at the end.
08:42:22 <tic|school> http://rafb.net/paste/results/cTVSaF59.html
08:43:15 <kosmikus> it's probably required in the first component of fork, too
08:46:24 <tic|school> how come?
08:46:28 <tic|school> I don
08:46:33 <tic|school> Can I make it so I don't have to do that?
08:47:05 <kosmikus> I don't know what you want to define, but it definitely isn't type correct without.
08:48:07 <tic|school> Mhm..
08:48:20 <tic|school> I want to be able to fork off a process and continue with the rest of the code.
08:48:37 <tic|school> so, what I want is something like Fork (p) (q >>= k), but that's apparently not possible.
08:48:56 <tic|school> and if I do Fork (p >>= k) (q >>= k), I get a bad program.
08:50:18 <tic|school> kosmikus, http://rafb.net/paste/results/m3vWdO57.html
08:50:41 <tic|school> that does a) not work, and b) is not what I watn.
08:50:43 <tic|school> want.
08:51:10 <tic|school> but I can't seem to do p' >>= return () either, because then I parametrize on the wrong type
08:51:22 <tic|school> do I have to add "b" to Thread?
08:57:32 <tic|school> nobody?
08:57:33 <tic|school>  :8
08:57:35 <tic|school> :(
09:03:40 <tic|school> *home*
09:05:18 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I have some more darcs questions for you
09:06:29 <musasabi> Are there issues with GHC-6.4.1 not being able to use a package if a newer version is also installed?
09:06:29 <CosmicRay> do you want the ghc-6-4 branch for all the darcs repos, or just ghc?
09:06:35 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: hi, I've actually got to go right now
09:06:43 <CosmicRay> ok, I'll send you an email
09:06:46 <JaffaCake> sure, thanks
09:07:57 <musasabi> I am suplying -package HaXml-1.13 to GHC but -v9 shows that it is not exposed and GHC dies complaining that it cannot find modules from HaXml.
09:09:05 <dcoutts> musasabi, well you can expose it.
09:09:26 <dcoutts> musasabi, actually I seem to recall that the HaXml-1.13 package file was quite broken.
09:10:07 <dcoutts> musasabi, or perhaps that was version 1.12
09:10:47 <musasabi> hmm, ghc-pkg now lists it as exposed: True, but ghc says exposed: False
09:11:32 <dcoutts> well you can always explicitly say: ghc -package HaXml-1.13 ...
09:11:36 <musasabi> (after running ghc-pkg expose)
09:14:40 <xerox> Back in black.
09:15:09 <CosmicRay> xerox: was that a refernece to The Daily Show?
09:15:21 <musasabi> http://youzen.b2.fi/~musasabi/a.txt contains the errors.
09:15:31 <musasabi> Even an explicit -package HaXml-1.13 does not help.
09:15:40 <xerox> CosmicRay: who could say ;-)
09:16:11 <CosmicRay> well, I wouldn't have figured that many europeans were familiar with it, so I was surprised ;-)
09:18:16 <araujo> Is it good to see an 'action' as an abstraction of a operation?
09:18:41 <Korollary> CosmicRay: It's also a song, isn't it ?
09:19:12 <CosmicRay> Korollary: I probably owuldn't know
09:19:34 <CosmicRay> as a classical and opera fan,  I'm remarkably out of touch with contemporary music ;-)
09:20:16 <Korollary> CosmicRay: Ah, I believe it's an AC/DC song. I'd actually go ahead and say that the Daily Show segment is named thinking of that song.
09:26:32 <kowey> informal poll (trying to figure out a best practice here) :
09:26:46 <kowey> in a single source code file, do you prefer to put your helper stuff first, or last?
09:28:05 <Korollary> I don't even make an effort at organizing.
09:28:30 <kowey> it seems that everything i do leads me to make a mess
09:29:26 <Korollary> as messy as declarative code goes
09:30:17 <Korollary> I'd say 60% of my helper stuff is in the actual functions body in a let binding.
09:31:04 <xerox> Cale``: getting Spivak in this very moment!
10:24:49 <phys_rules> hello to everyone ;)
10:25:07 <musasabi> good evening
10:25:29 <phys_rules> has anyone tried to bootstrap ghc on solaris x86 ? :)
10:26:23 <musasabi> I don't think so, but I it is on my list of things to do (when I get some other stuff done).
10:26:36 <phys_rules> I'm trying it =)
10:26:37 <musasabi> but if you get a port working I would be interested
10:26:46 <phys_rules> though I don't have a linux install
10:26:52 <phys_rules> so I was bootrstrapping it from windows =)
10:27:01 <phys_rules> I get the .hc's and all (finally)
10:27:14 <musasabi> that might be more complicated, but could work too
10:27:21 <phys_rules> but I get the errors about not finding stg_apt_0_ret
10:27:50 <phys_rules> everything in rts compiles just fine
10:27:54 <phys_rules> except the .hc's
10:28:12 <phys_rules> it can't find the stg_apt_.. ;(
10:32:25 <musasabi> phys_rules: you did make it an unregistered build without nativecodegen?
10:32:51 <phys_rules> musasabi: yes
10:32:58 <phys_rules> musasabi: followed the instructions from ch.10
10:33:28 <benny> i understand that there are a few libraries/modules for haskell that are supposed to help making parsers?
10:35:43 <musasabi> benny: Parsec, ReadP, Happy, Frown, (and Alex for lexers)
10:35:50 <phys_rules> musasabi: who is suppose to export stg_apt_0_ret ?
10:36:16 <benny> musasabi: nice.... now my question is, how easy is it really to make a simple parser?
10:37:00 <musasabi> benny: very easy, Haskell is a very good language for parsers.
10:38:01 <musasabi> phys_rules: I don't have the sources conveniently here (should go to home first)
10:39:48 <benny> musasabi: cool. then will it be possible to call my parser function from python?
10:40:43 <sieni> benny: probably, since you can call C from Python and Haskell from C
10:41:11 <benny> can i compile the haskell code into a c library?
10:42:40 <musasabi> benny: you can compile it into an .a file.
10:43:14 <benny> cool, how exactly does that work?
10:43:21 <musasabi> The GHC user manual has the section about running Haskell without main inside Haskell.
10:43:41 <benny> the .a file will contain all of the haskell runtime and the garbage collecter and everything?
10:45:25 <musasabi> you can create such an .a file (iirc)
10:46:03 <musasabi> (of course I would rather just link all the .o files with GHC)
10:46:06 <dcoutts> ar cru *.o -o foo.a
10:46:11 <benny> cool. i think i read somewhere that ghc haskell compiler can transform haskell code into c code?
10:46:22 <phys_rules> hey dcoutts ;)
10:46:26 <dcoutts> hia
10:47:11 <phys_rules> musasabi: that's the weird, thing, Apply.hc should export the symbols, and yet when I try to compile it, it says it can't find the definition for those symbols even though it is suppose to declare them ... rather odd
10:48:59 <basti_> luqui: did you watch haskell-overflow?
10:49:30 <musasabi> benny: yes, it can compile Haskell via C.
10:50:05 <musasabi> benny: but the C code is not very readable and GHC postprocesses the assembler produced by gcc for performance gains.
10:50:08 <basti_> luqui: is that name chinese or "ololiuqui"? ;)
10:50:17 <benny> ok thanks man musasabi, last question, which of those libraries that you listed should i use?
10:50:36 <musasabi> benny: depends on what you are doing.
10:50:47 <musasabi> benny: I would go either with parsec or happy.
10:58:13 <luqui> basti_, I don't know what haskell-overflow is...
10:58:20 <luqui> what's ololiqui?
10:58:39 <dash> hello, lambdaites
10:58:43 <luqui> (the name is a spanish nickname for my real name)
10:59:02 <dash> can someone remind me the non-literal character syntax for haskell
10:59:07 <basti_> luqui: some plant
10:59:14 <basti_> luqui: join there if you want
10:59:19 <musasabi> luqui: it is a channel - #haskell-overflow
10:59:33 <dash> i.e., "character 0x7E"
10:59:38 <musasabi> In addition we have #haskell-blah for fun things.
11:00:48 <basti_> > show (chr 20)
11:00:49 <lambdabot> "'\\DC4'"
11:00:53 <basti_> they got names
11:01:04 <dash> hmmmm
11:01:08 <basti_> but i think you can give a number as well
11:01:23 <basti_> > show '\020'
11:01:24 <lambdabot> "'\\DC4'"
11:01:30 <dash> i am trying to write a parsec parser and part of this grammar specifies the production as a range of characters
11:01:42 <dash> so i figured it would be nice to do so in the code as well
11:02:13 <musasabi> dash: oneOf ['a' .. 'z'] ? (there are more efficient ways to do this)
11:02:54 <dash> musasabi: well more like:
11:02:55 <dash> ctext    =  %x21-27 / %x2A-5B / %x5D-7E 
11:04:58 <musasabi> isCText chr = between 0x21 0x27 || between 0x2A 0x5B || between 0x5D 0x7E where between a b = o >= a && o <= b; o = ord chr
11:05:14 <musasabi> and then use that
11:21:02 <astrolabe> how can I abstract out a pattern?  I want to define f 0 v = x, f 1 v = y, where v = (x,y).
11:25:56 <musasabi> f k (x,y) = inner k where inner 0 = x; inner 1 = y
11:26:38 <astrolabe> musasabi: thanks.  Would you beleive, I'd just worked it out!  But thanks anyway.
11:26:44 <xerox> take_ n (x,y) | n == 0 = x | otherwise = y
11:27:22 <musasabi> f 0 = fst; f 1 = snd ;)
11:27:43 <astrolabe> ok thanks both of you, but that was only a toy example :)
11:28:41 <Korollary> f k (x,y) = case k of ...
11:29:02 <astrolabe> ok, now I'm starting to feel stupid.
11:30:09 <Korollary> you picked the wrong language to ask about abstractions ;)
11:30:54 <astrolabe> Yeah, I still haven't used it enough not to forget its features.
11:31:16 <astrolabe> Still, at least I have a garlic mushroom pizza in the oven.
11:31:24 <Korollary> Yes, frequent use is necessary
11:32:44 <Korollary> I've been trying to learn ocaml and scheme. I understand everything in the docs, but I don't have any time to write enough code. :(
11:33:51 <benny> what do you guys think about dillan?
11:34:08 <Korollary> dylan ?
11:34:34 <dash> dylan is kinda neat
11:34:48 <dash> goo is an improvement on dylan
11:36:27 * dash discovers Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Rfc2234
11:36:28 <dash> woohoo
11:38:19 <Korollary> from a dylan tutorial: "Dynamic languages allow the programmer to create variables without explicitly specifying the type of information they contain." heh
11:39:29 <benny> dylan is a dynamic language? :O
11:41:44 <Korollary> Wow, the Dylan Language White Paper doesn't even use the word "functional". It seems to be OO heavy.
11:41:52 <musasabi> it is a little bit like common lisp.
11:43:07 <neologism> what so great about making a variable without type?
11:43:22 <neologism> if (blah) i = 1 else i = "1"
11:43:27 <neologism> i = i + 1;
11:43:30 <neologism> whats i ? 
11:43:34 <xerox> A variable.
11:43:36 <Korollary> neologism: DWIM !
11:43:36 <musasabi> neologism: being able to say:
11:43:42 <neologism> what dwim?
11:43:47 <xerox> @wtf DWIM
11:43:50 <Korollary> neologism: the perl mantra
11:43:52 <lambdabot> No match for "DWIM".
11:43:58 <Korollary> Do What I Mean
11:44:11 <musasabi> @type (let a = a in a)
11:44:12 <lambdabot> forall t. t
11:44:15 <Korollary> for some value of What I May Possibly Mean.
11:44:28 <xerox> WIMPM
11:44:38 <neologism> musasabi: no doubt that type variables are great
11:44:50 <neologism> but I dont think that weakly typed langugaes are any graet
11:45:08 <Korollary> neologism: most people in this channel would think so.
11:45:58 <kombinator> wouldn't "1" be counverted to 1 when used in _ + 1 in perl?
11:46:09 <neologism> it doesnt matter
11:46:21 <neologism> I can always say 'else i = "fuck"'
11:46:57 <Korollary> In Perl there is a type called scalar that is inhabited by values of integers, strings, etc.
11:47:37 <xerox> perl -e 'my $x = "1"; print $x + 1;'
11:47:45 <xerox> Oops, wrong window.
11:48:07 <Korollary> for example, in a boolean 'context', 0, "" and "0" all evaluate to False.
11:48:28 <neologism> this is strange
11:48:33 <neologism> I dont like this approach
11:48:43 <Korollary> Perl is pretty strange.
11:48:49 <neologism> perl is a great tool
11:48:56 <Korollary> but there are millions of people who love that approach.
11:49:00 <neologism> it was never meant to be a programming language I think
11:49:15 <neologism> there are millions of people who like to watch big brother and eat hamburgers ;)
11:49:20 <xerox> Practical Extraction and Reporting Language ?
11:49:22 <neologism> which doesnt make it any good
11:49:35 <Korollary> 'good' gets us into philosophy.
11:50:14 <neologism> anyway - I just wanted to express my attitude which is "I dont like wealky typed languages"
11:50:15 <benny> does anyone here know ocaml and dylan well?
11:50:30 <Korollary> neologism: duly noted. Ditto fwiw.
11:50:51 <neologism> Korollary: I dont understand a single word ;)
11:50:53 <neologism> pls translate
11:51:11 <neologism> whats fwiw?
11:51:15 <Korollary> neologism: "I understand. For what it's worth, I agree with your sentiments"
11:51:21 <neologism> :)
11:51:21 <Korollary> @wtf fwiw
11:51:23 <neologism> ok.. thnx
11:51:23 <lambdabot> No match for "fwiw".

11:54:14 <neologism> haskell would be VERY nice scripting language
11:54:23 <Korollary> It is. I use it as such.
11:54:48 <neologism> should deserve to be more widespread
11:54:49 <kombinator> s/would be/is
11:55:22 <neologism> I mean. people should switch from perl/awk/bash/tcsh/etc. to haskell and such languages
11:55:28 <neologism> would make world a better place for living >0
11:55:29 <neologism> ;)
11:55:32 <Korollary> well, when people think of scripting, they think of 'hackjobs'.
11:55:42 <neologism> haskell is great for hackjobs :)
11:56:37 <Korollary> I meant that they get frustrated by the compilation errors and want something that would run immediately without complaining and do "rm -rf".
11:57:56 <neologism> I dont get much errors in haskell
11:58:42 <astrolabe> I get lots of compiler errors, but not many bugs afterwards.
11:58:50 <neologism> I mean... simple things
11:58:54 <Korollary> Getting compilation errors never bothered me, including in C++, Java, etc.
11:59:14 <fworp> its those other kinds of errors that are a pain
11:59:41 <neologism> well.. when I was writing an interpret of a simple language (school project)
11:59:55 <neologism> it was very handy to let simple haskell program generate all possible combinations of the language
12:00:00 <neologism> and let the interpret run 'em
12:00:04 <neologism> really nice thing
12:31:38 <Korollary> happy thanksgiving, .us
12:37:34 <takuan> is it possible to do an automatic conversion from an Int to an arbitrary data type?
12:38:01 <Heffalump> what would you expect such a conversion to do?
12:38:02 <xerox> @type fromInteger
12:38:03 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => Integer -> a
12:38:04 <xerox> @type fromIntegral
12:38:05 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Num b, Integral a) => a -> b
12:38:28 <xerox> The latter translates an Int or an Integer to whateever Num a you prefer,
12:38:39 <takuan> Heffalump: something like fromInteger :D
12:39:32 <Heffalump> that's not to an arbitrary data type :-)
12:39:51 <takuan> well, I meant, a data type that I could define
12:39:54 <takuan> ;)
12:41:15 <CosmicRay> Korollary: thanks
12:44:52 <reddi_> i have the following list  [(1,[1,2,4]),(2,[1,3]),(3,[2]),(4,[1,4]),(5,[])]  and i need as a between result [(2,[1,3]),(3,[2]),(4,[1,4]),(5,[])]  ++ [(1,[1]),(2,[1]),(4,[1])]  and so on
12:45:03 <takuan> humz
12:45:14 <takuan> say that my data type is something like Modulo a
12:45:37 <takuan> now I would like an instance declaration so that I could define fromInteger for Modulo Int
12:45:39 <integral> you want a type-level integer?
12:45:40 <takuan> is that possible?
12:45:46 <integral> n/m
12:45:55 <reddi_> is there a "directer" function
12:46:03 <reddi_> which does that for me (as zipping, unzipping)
12:46:07 <takuan> integral: ?
12:46:08 <reddi_> or do i have to programm it by myself?
12:46:27 <integral> takuan: n/m it's not what you're meaning
12:46:46 <takuan> ok, do you have any  idea if it's possible/
12:46:47 <takuan> ?
12:50:10 <astrolabe> should be possible I think.
12:50:21 <SlowByte> "against the KISS approach of PHP"... err, the KISS approach of PHP? PHP has an approach?
12:50:24 * SlowByte chuckles
12:51:25 <SlowByte> having a couple of thousand functions without any decent naming conventions lying around in the global namespace is certainly something that a KISS advocate can be proud of
12:51:30 <SlowByte> </sarcasm>
12:51:38 <Korollary> PHP has as much approach as a 747 without landing gear.
12:52:36 <SlowByte> hey, this is #haskell. wrong channel, but I guess it still fits :)
12:52:41 <CosmicRay> hah
12:52:46 * CosmicRay jumps in
12:52:51 <CosmicRay> you know, I'veused php some.
12:52:58 <CosmicRay> it makes me feel extremely nervous every time I do.
12:53:08 <CosmicRay> and I'm extremely nervous every time I install an app that uses php
12:53:30 <CosmicRay> because the thing detects so little at runtime, all sorts o fnasty surprises can occur
12:53:32 <CosmicRay> anyway
12:53:45 <CosmicRay> the only reason I use it is that it has some useful libraries.
12:53:51 <CosmicRay> would love to see a haskell equivolent
12:54:45 <Korollary> libraries is the word
12:54:56 <Korollary> someone wrote some code for me. aww.

12:58:26 <reddi_> >inv_graph3 input = [(k,l)|l<-fst input,k<-fst input]
12:58:30 <reddi_> what is wrong here?
12:58:42 <reddi_> fst input is not allowed, but why?
12:59:45 <SlowByte> I haven't written a single line of Haskell, but does fst work on tuples?
12:59:56 <quagmire> @fst (1,[2,3])
12:59:57 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: fact msg
13:00:10 <Cale> SlowByte: fst works on pairs
13:00:17 <Cale> > fst (1,2)
13:00:18 <lambdabot> 1
13:00:21 <CosmicRay> SlowByte: fst works only on tuples.  2-yuples, in fact.
13:00:21 <Cale> > fst (1,2,4)
13:00:22 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `(a, b)' against `(a1, b1, c)'
13:00:26 <CosmicRay> >fst (1, [2, 3])
13:00:30 <CosmicRay> > fst (1, [2, 3])
13:00:31 <lambdabot> 1
13:00:39 <CosmicRay> > fst ([1, 2], 3)
13:00:40 <lambdabot> [1,2]
13:00:41 <quagmire> "fst input" is not a list, so the comprehension syntax fails
13:00:46 <Heffalump> > >
13:00:47 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `>'
13:00:50 <Heffalump> > (>)
13:00:51 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Show (a -> a -> Bool))
13:01:27 <quagmire> [ (k,ell) | let ell <-snd input, let k = fst input ] makes some sense
13:01:58 <quagmire> err, I meant  [ (k,ell) | ell <-snd input, let k = fst input ] 
13:03:30 <reddi_> hm ok, it doesnt make sense, but i want to get away the type error
13:03:54 <reddi_> (1,[1,2,4])  shall get (1,1), (2,1),(4,1)
13:05:24 <reddi_> but it doesnt matter now, the question is: why do i get an error?
13:08:39 <Cale> reddi_: because the types don't work out
13:08:51 <Cale> fst input isn't a list
13:09:03 <Cale> so you can't use it in a generator
13:09:15 <reddi_> so i have to make a list out of it
13:09:28 <quagmire> or use "let k = fst input"
13:10:53 <Cale> inv_graph3 (u,vs) = [(k,u) | k <- vs]
13:11:26 <Cale> there's no need to use fst and snd when you can pattern match :)
13:12:46 <benny> are there people who dislike the way that a lot of haskell functions are really short like snd instead of second?:
13:12:53 <boegel|home> @show-result TopTenLibraries

13:13:55 * Lemmih wonders if HSP could be considered a library.
13:15:08 <kombinator> @vote TopTenLibraries Gtk2Hs
13:15:08 <lambdabot> voted on "Gtk2Hs"
13:15:51 <benny> what is HSP? is it what i think it is?
13:16:45 <boegel|home> Lemmih: if you think it is, add it to the poll !
13:17:03 <Lemmih> If you think it is 'Haskell Server Pages', then yes.
13:18:17 <benny> hm... doesn't sound like such a great idea to me
13:18:29 <Lemmih> How so?
13:18:52 <benny> the whole concept of server pages feels like an ugly hack to me
13:20:01 <Lemmih> Why is that?
13:20:26 <benny> i think that haskell would be really good for your website if tried to figure out a formal model of your website and then describe that in haskell
13:20:59 <benny> but HSP is probably cool for simple things
13:21:03 <Lemmih> And HSP allows you to do just that.
13:21:42 <benny> ok, i don't know anything about HSP so i don't want to jude it :)
13:22:12 <benny> but if it's anything like php where you need a seperate file for each page, then that puts constraints on you
13:23:58 <boegel|home> benny: you don't need a seperate file for each page...
13:24:28 <benny> you mean the php trick where you have an index.php that handles everything?
13:25:34 <Lemmih> Is it more of a trick than a Haskell file that handles everything?
13:26:17 <boegel|home> benny: yeah :p
13:26:51 <boegel|home> benny: also, you can use includes to seperate stuff... I think php is a great technology
13:26:51 <Lemmih> However, comparing PHP and HSP isn't really feasible.
13:26:59 <boegel|home> probably :)
13:27:03 <boegel|home> anyway, I have to go
13:27:12 <boegel|home> I have to get up at 5.30 tomorrow morning, so...
13:27:15 <boegel|home> g'night everyone !
13:27:21 <benny> like i said, i don't know anything about HSP, but i'm sure that it's way better then php :)
13:27:33 <benny> and server pages are very useful in lots of situations
13:28:05 <Lemmih> What exactly are server pages?
13:28:16 <benny> but i also think that with haskell one could design a really cool "webapp framework" with really original ideas
13:28:29 <benny> like what ruby on rails does
13:28:42 <Lemmih> I've always though of them as a fancy name for a web site.
13:29:26 <musasabi> The problem is that the types get unwieldy.
13:29:43 <benny> musasabi: eh?
13:30:10 <musasabi> benny: see e.g. the type signatures in http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/hswebforms/doc/html/WebForm.HaskellDB.html
13:30:34 <benny> musasabi: you are talking about a problem with doing "web programming" in haskell?
13:31:50 <Lemmih> musasabi: Those types are from HaskellDB and not HSP.
13:34:32 <poetix> dons: ping
13:34:50 <Lemmih> benny: What's a 'server page'?
13:35:34 <benny> the way i understand it is usually it's an html page with embedded code
13:37:14 <musasabi> Lemmih: yes, and web programming is very often getting values out of a DB and displaying them in a sensible way.
13:38:18 <reddi_> >inv_graph4 [(x,y)]=[(x,z)|z<-]   what do i have to writer after z to get every x where zy is a appending of every occouring y (e.g. --> [(1,[2]),(1,[3]) ] --> [(1,[2,3])]
13:39:35 <Lemmih> benny: Hm, I should probably rename HSP, then.
13:42:10 <Lemmih> @seen nibro
13:42:11 <lambdabot> I haven't seen nibro.
13:43:02 <poetix> Anyone know if gtk2hs includes the gnome db interface?
13:43:35 <poetix> Looking at that question, there, it's quite a silly question
13:43:40 <poetix> gtk != gnome
13:43:57 <mwc> (thank god)
13:44:04 <phys_rules> mwc++
13:44:05 <phys_rules> :)
13:44:47 <poetix> I'm wondering about the best way to connect Haskell to postgres
13:45:37 <mwc> i'd say you'd probably want to talk over a pipe through the IO monad
13:45:49 <mwc> and then build some sort of pure functional query system
13:45:50 <chucky> haskelldb or hsql?
13:46:03 <mwc> or you could use something that's already been built
13:46:06 <chucky> depending on what level of abstraction you want
13:47:15 <reddi_> map snd (sort [(1,[1]),(2,[1]),(4,[1]),(1,[2]),(3,[2]),(2,[3]),(1,[4]),(4,[4])]) 
13:47:16 <poetix> Probably hsql - but does it provide an interface to stored procedures?
13:47:17 <reddi_> this works fine
13:47:33 <reddi_> but: how to i say map only where the first element is e.g. 1?
13:47:41 <reddi_> is there a function?
13:47:50 <mwc> yeah, filter I think
13:48:06 <musasabi> poetix: you can use stored procedures with SELECT.
13:48:30 <poetix> Can you? How?
13:48:45 <mwc> reddi_, http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html#v%3Afilter
13:49:07 <poetix> filter (\(x, _) -> x == 1)
13:49:15 <mwc> yah
13:49:30 <mwc> just put that before your map snd using function composition
13:50:03 <musasabi> poetix: SELECT my_function();
13:50:09 <poetix> map snd . filter (\(x, _) -> x == 1) . sort
13:50:25 <reddi_> [(1,[1]),(1,[2]),(1,[4]),(2,[1]),(2,[3]),(3,[2]),(4,[1]),(4,[4])]      
13:50:28 <palomer> > (\(x,_) -> x) (1,2)
13:50:29 <reddi_> is there no easier way
13:50:29 <lambdabot> 1
13:50:47 <poetix> musasabi: thanks - is that postgres specific? I've never seen that syntax for SP invocation before
13:51:09 <reddi_> to say every element where the fst is 1 make [(1,[1,2,4]),(2,[1,3]),...]
13:51:09 <poetix> @eval map snd . filter (\(x, _) -> x == 1) . sort  [(1,[1]),(2,[1]),(4,[1]),(1,[2]),(3,[2]),(2,[3]),(1,[4]),(4,[4])]
13:51:10 <lambdabot>   Expecting a function type, but found `[a]'
13:51:10 <lambdabot>   Expected type: a1 -> [(a, b)]
13:51:10 <lambdabot>   Inferred type: [a2]
13:51:33 <reddi_> i am thinking on a workarround with filter
13:51:33 <poetix> @eval map snd . filter (\(x, _) -> x == 1) . sort $  [(1,[1]),(2,[1]),(4,[1]),(1,[2]),(3,[2]),(2,[3]),(1,[4]),(4,[4])]
13:51:35 <lambdabot> [[1],[2],[4]]
13:52:10 <musasabi> poetix: what have you used then?
13:52:27 <poetix> Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL (which until v. recently didn't have stored procedures)
13:52:37 <poetix> Always used exec with the first two
13:54:10 <musasabi> mmh, I don't think one would use EXEC with postgresql
13:55:01 <poetix> I've always tended to go through higher-level APIs anyway, like *koff* ADO
13:55:15 <musasabi> also you can tie stored procedures to views and thus use them with haskelldb
13:55:37 <palomer>  can . be thought as right associative composition?
13:55:46 <palomer>         err, application
13:56:05 <poetix> (f . g) x == f(g(x))
13:56:06 <ccshan> $ is right associative composition
13:56:19 <ccshan> @eval map snd $ filter (\(x, _) -> x == 1) $ sort $  [(1,[1]),(2,[1]),(4,[1]),(1,[2]),(3,[2]),(2,[3]),(1,[4]),(4,[4])]
13:56:20 <lambdabot> [[1],[2],[4]]
13:56:28 <ccshan> err, application
13:56:45 <palomer>  a . b . c is a (b c) , no?
13:56:55 <ccshan> a . b . c is \x. a (b (c x))
13:57:04 <palomer> oh, righto
13:57:08 <ccshan> err, \x -> a (b (c x))
13:57:30 <palomer> which is \x -> a $ b $ c x
13:58:10 <palomer> but, really, everytime I've seen . used, we could have just used $
13:58:21 <palomer> (or, rather, many times)
13:58:23 <Cale> only then you have to add a lambda
13:58:41 <quagmire> @listcommands
13:58:41 <ccshan> I would have written "filter ((1==).fst)" instead of "filter (\(x,_) -> x==1)"
13:58:42 <lambdabot> use listcommands [module|command], please. Modules are:
13:58:42 <lambdabot> babel base code dice dict dummy dynamic elite fact haddock help hoogle
13:58:42 <lambdabot> karma localtime more pl plugs poll quote search seen spell state system
13:58:42 <lambdabot> todo topic type version vixen where
13:58:49 <Cale> It's often nice to avoid lambdas
13:59:07 <palomer> Cale: but usually they just take the composition and apply it right away
13:59:14 <Cale> filter (not . null) is one of my favourites
13:59:16 <poetix> @vixen Do you see the point in this conversation?
13:59:17 <lambdabot> why don't you guess?
13:59:27 <poetix> Avoiding lambdas is pointless
13:59:32 <Cale> heh
13:59:38 <palomer> ooh, I like filter (not . null)
13:59:40 <Cale> it's point-free :)
13:59:43 <musasabi> poetix: that meens a freedom for points
13:59:52 <basti_> from points
13:59:55 <poetix> Points win prizes!
14:00:13 <musasabi> no, pointless style means that is has points.
14:00:24 <Cale> hm?
14:00:25 <basti_> and the points are not in haskell. In haskell the point is rendered as ->
14:00:31 <Cale> uh, no
14:00:34 <Cale> what?
14:00:34 <basti_> as in \a->a+1
14:00:39 <basti_> \a.a+1
14:00:43 <Cale> the point in \a -> a + 1 is 'a'
14:00:45 * musasabi boings with a pointy lambda
14:00:46 <basti_> thats where this "point" comes from isnt it?
14:00:49 <Cale> no
14:00:53 <basti_> ah
14:01:19 <Cale> \a -> a + 1 is a function which specifies where values (or points) get sent
14:01:22 <ski> @remember poetix Avoiding lambdas is pointless
14:01:29 <Cale> bbiab
14:01:55 <basti_> uh
14:01:56 <basti_> ok
14:03:17 <poetix> @type not . null
14:03:18 <lambdabot> forall a. [a] -> Bool
14:03:42 <poetix> @eval not . null $ 1
14:03:43 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num [a])
14:04:07 <poetix> @eval not . null $ []
14:04:08 <lambdabot> False
14:04:20 <poetix> @eval not . null $ [1]
14:04:22 <lambdabot> True
14:04:56 <poetix> @eval filter (not . null) [[], [1], [], [2], [], [3]]
14:04:58 <lambdabot> [[1],[2],[3]]
14:05:24 <poetix> \me doesn't see what's so special about that
14:05:46 * poetix , I mean
14:06:17 * poetix boings, in the hope of creating a distraction
14:06:43 <palomer> it's nicer than filter (\x -> not (null x))
14:07:49 <benny> hey guys, i've bought the benjamin pierce book "basic category theory for computer scientists" but the problem is that i can't get past the first page. i've read it like 50 times and i don't understand it
14:08:02 <ski> hm
14:08:11 <ski> what is it you don't understand ?
14:08:27 <ski> goder natt, david__
14:09:09 <poetix> At a guess, category theory
14:09:13 <palomer> the best category theory book is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521478170/002-9683773-4596829?v=glance&n=283155&n=507846&s=books&v=glance
14:09:22 <poetix> Which is OK, 'cos I don't understand it either...
14:09:23 <palomer> actually, that's the best introductory category theory book
14:09:25 <integral> benny: are you a computer scientist?
14:09:35 <palomer> HOWEVER, it is important to learn why category theory is important before learning about it
14:09:47 <Philippa_> if you're a computer scientist with no real set theory background that book's still hard going
14:09:48 <ski> palomer : that's a quite good book, yes
14:09:58 <poetix> That's exactly what I don't understand: the what *for*
14:10:03 <benny> integral: i don't really have any training in anything
14:10:09 <integral> ah
14:10:29 <ski> benny : what is the first thing you don't understand, there ?
14:10:34 <benny> integral: i only know a bit of basic algebra and calculus
14:10:44 <integral> eep :-/
14:10:49 <poetix> benny: Learn set theory! It's fun!
14:11:12 <poetix> Insofar as I understand CT *at all*, it's through set theory
14:11:26 <ski> (axiom of foundation is a bit evil)
14:11:32 <integral> does "set theory" include groups?
14:11:50 <Philippa_> poetix: personally the "for" is modelling really abstract stuff
14:11:52 <palomer> category theory serves as a model for many things
14:11:55 <pediddle> does anyone know of a Cont/ContT-based implementation of control/prompt?
14:12:00 <pediddle> shift/reset is pretty common
14:12:12 <Philippa_> much as eg I would've benefitted from learning abstract algebra when I was 15
14:12:15 <palomer> however, what those things are, and which aspect of those things are, might or might not be interesting to you
14:12:26 <palomer> s/second which/what
14:12:38 <palomer> s/aspects studied/aspect
14:12:46 <benny> ski: i don't remember, i think i understand and i slowly go from one sentance to the next. but then i get to the excersice and i'm like "WTF?"
14:13:04 <ski> pediddle : hm, think that one can get control/prompt through some CPS-like thing .. so i guess one could possibly do some monad-like thing of that ..
14:13:21 <ski> benny : which sentence is that ?
14:13:49 <benny> ski: sorry, don't quite remember. and unfortunately right now i'm not in much of a thinking mood
14:13:57 <ski> benny : ok
14:14:24 * ski 's neither ..
14:14:26 <palomer> for example, once you learn what a CCC is, you might wonder "how does this model typed lambda terms" and, well, I still haven't found in which way this model is useful
14:15:02 <Philippa_> often it's as much because it helps you translate other categorical constructs back into lambda terms
14:15:18 <palomer> yes yes, but these models bother me
14:15:42 <Philippa_> I /have/ found some of the "we'll build our language in terms of category theory" definitions useful
14:15:44 <palomer> a model is an environment in which one can evaluate sentences, ie closed first order formulae
14:16:32 <palomer> a model of something is something which contains the same true sentences as that thing, in a restricted language
14:16:58 <benny> btw what ever happened to MegaMonad?
14:17:53 <palomer> a model of the natural numbers, for example, may contain the functions +,-,/, and predicates "less than" and "divides"
14:18:29 <palomer> so, any sentence concerning +,-,/ and predicates "less than" and "divides" can be evaluated by looking at the model
14:19:01 <palomer> however, categorical models don't seem to deal with any interesting sentences 
14:19:03 <ccshan> pediddle: Typed implementations at http://www.brics.dk/RS/05/16/index.html http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/control/
14:19:03 <Philippa_> benny: it got boring, and I think there was some concern about some of the things it might come out with
14:19:14 <Philippa_> (especially given some of the conversations that now happen in -blah instead)
14:19:28 <ccshan> pediddle: Untyped implementations at http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Continuations.html http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~ccshan/recur/recur.pdf
14:19:42 <palomer> if someone could convince me of the contrary, that would be great!
14:19:57 <pediddle> wow, thanks, i found the untyped implementations but was having trouble translating those
14:20:27 <ski> ccshan : Chung-Chieh Shan ?
14:20:47 <Philippa_> palomer: the simply-typed lambda calculus doesn't really deal with any interesting sentences IMO, though YMMV
14:20:58 <Philippa_> (and especially not without an environment)
14:21:09 <ccshan> pediddle: http://www.brics.dk/RS/05/13/index.html translates http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~ccshan/recur/recur.pdf into ML
14:21:21 <ccshan> ski: yes, hi
14:22:33 <ski> (ccshan : just a bit surprised and nice to meet you on irc. i like the papers of yours i've seen)
14:22:46 <ccshan> thanks (:
14:22:52 <ccshan> ... you are?
14:23:24 <ski> (just an undergrad student who's read some papers ..)
14:24:21 <ccshan> ski: like when I meet someone like this in person, I'd like to know more about you and get you to go to grad school (:
14:26:08 <ski> hehe, ty
14:26:45 * poetix tries to remember which papers of Shan's he's seen
14:26:55 <poetix> ccshan: I think you're a bit of a local celebrity...
14:27:56 * ski thinks composable continuations and natural language is interesting
14:28:19 <poetix> Reminds me, I really need to figure out a path through the delimited control operators literature - almost everything I read refers back to something else I haven't read
14:28:20 * ccshan bows
14:28:53 <poetix> ski: As in sub-clauses (and parentheses)?
14:29:16 <ski> maybe that, too . don't remember
14:29:27 <ski> stuff like quantification, e.g.
14:31:05 <ski> (implies (owns (a man) (a donkey)) (beats he it)) .. something like that, iirc
14:31:59 <ski> (or was that anaphora ? .. maybe the quantification was handled by the comp. cont.s, anyway)
14:32:32 * ski must head to bed before he collapses here ..
14:32:35 <poetix> Most of the things I look at on delimited control operators refer back to Felleisen at some point - is there a particular paper of his that's a good place to start?
14:34:10 * ski like Abstracting Control and Representing Control (both Olivier Danvy .. maybe some coauthor, too ..)
14:34:21 <ski> good night, #haskell
14:34:36 <poetix> me to bed too - night all
14:36:10 <ccshan> poetix: it really depends on your background -- if you're a programming kind of person, perhaps his paper with Sitaram ("Control Delimiters and Their Hierarchies") or his dissertation
14:36:38 <ccshan> if you're a math kind of person, perhaps "The Theory and Practice of First-Class Prompts"
14:37:26 <ccshan> in general, things are much easier to learn if you have a potential application in mind... category theory or delimited continuations
14:57:04 <ChilliX> Hi shapr
14:57:32 <shapr> g'day ChilliX, how's code?
14:57:52 <ChilliX> not much coding...more marking :/
14:58:25 <shapr> I've seen a few automatic marking apps in Haskell. Doesn't Hughes use something based on WASH?
14:58:34 <dash> hmm
14:58:43 <shapr> hiya dash
14:59:02 <dash> shapr: hey hey
14:59:13 * dash rummages through the stdlib looking for a mapping type
14:59:16 <ChilliX> well marking exams, that's not going to be automatic
14:59:29 <shapr> dash: Data.Map ?
14:59:33 <dash> yay
15:00:19 <shapr> ChilliX: Oh hey, if GRIN is much like lambda calculus, it might not need phi functions?
15:00:27 <shapr> It would just need to be in somethin resembling ANF?
15:01:42 <shapr> Not that I've had time to reread GRIN since reading your lambda-ssa paper... maybe I postpone discussion until I have something to discuss.
15:01:47 <shapr> should*
15:01:59 * shapr is tired from too many hours of Python work...
15:02:54 <dash> shapr: what are you doing these days, anyway
15:03:21 <ChilliX> shapr: yes, GRIN is more like lambda calculus, so it doesn't need phi functions, but therefore I was objecting calling it an SSA form the other day
15:03:45 <ChilliX> as *the* unique feature of SSA forms are the phi functions
15:03:51 <shapr> oh, I see.
15:04:05 <shapr> Well, that clears up the whole question then, thanks.
15:04:12 <ChilliX> :)
15:04:21 <shapr> dash: SSDD, I hack Plone into shape.
15:04:26 <dash> ah
15:04:31 <dash> a large task indeed
15:04:40 <ChilliX> Plone?
15:04:49 <dash> ChilliX: python CMS
15:04:52 <shapr> ChilliX: mammoth python web dev framework
15:05:02 <ChilliX> ic
15:05:19 <malcolm_> ChilliX: we get our first-year students to submit examined programs online, and they get tested and scored automatically
15:05:48 <ChilliX> malcolm_: that's what we do with programming assigments, too
15:06:24 <ChilliX> but the University requires that in any course, at least 50% of the assessment is in the form of sit-in exams (not take home)
15:06:44 <palomer> malcolm_: yeah, I set that up for the course I'm TAing
15:06:49 <shapr> kowey: I had fun reading your monads tutorial. Space stations and astronauts and robots, oh my!
15:06:50 <ChilliX> So, this leaves the choice between a prac exam or a written exam
15:07:05 <ChilliX> Prac exams are quite an effort to organise
15:07:44 <ChilliX> Hence, almost all courses have a written exam at the end
15:07:48 <malcolm_> ChilliX: I find marking a written exam is largely a mechanical exercise, with only occasional need for intelligent appraisal, so I bet day we'll be able to automate it
15:08:22 <ChilliX> malcolm_: It is a mechanical and most boring task - in fatc, I hate it
15:08:28 <ChilliX> fatc = fact
15:09:10 <ChilliX> but it requires rather sophisticated pattern matching abilities if you don't want to do everything by multiple choice
15:09:50 <palomer> there's no need for manual marking in most cs courses, really
15:10:20 <ChilliX> no?
15:10:31 <palomer> exams can be of the form "program this"
15:10:47 <palomer> unless there are proofs to write
15:10:50 <malcolm_> ChilliX: yes, OCR for text, plus natural language interpretation, plus diagram recognition, is all still a hefty task for a machine
15:10:52 <palomer> and, since this is #haskell, proofs are programs
15:10:59 <palomer> >:O
15:11:07 <ChilliX> Well and how do you make sure people submit their own solutions?
15:11:18 <palomer> ChilliX: you have them sit in a room to program it
15:11:35 <ChilliX> Ah, yes, that's what we call a prac exam
15:11:43 <ChilliX> A bitch to organise for large classes
15:11:44 <malcolm_> set an individual variant of the problem for every student..?
15:12:10 <palomer> ChilliX: yes, but imagine the time (and thus money) you save by doing for every exam
15:12:15 <ChilliX> You need large enough computer rooms, make sure machines cannot access the Internet freely and so on
15:12:42 <ChilliX> palomer: We do do prac exams.  It's just that they don't really save much time.
15:12:59 <palomer> ChilliX: once you have a systematic way of doing it, then I don't see how it could be a problem
15:13:01 <shapr> malcolm_: Good idea, but they still might get someone else to solve it for them.
15:13:33 <ChilliX> palomer: As I said, facilities are one thing.
15:13:56 <palomer> ChilliX: cutting network access could be as easy as unglugging the RJ connector
15:14:00 <shapr> ChilliX: What about combining palomer and malcolm_'s suggestions for asynchronous generative tests?
15:14:23 <shapr> instance Arbitrary LambdaCalculus where ...
15:14:34 <palomer> and ,erm, my university has about 8 computer labs, each with about 25 computers
15:14:38 <ChilliX> palomer: Then, you need standalone machine, which is completely contrary to our lab organisation.
15:14:41 <malcolm_> instance Arbitrary ExamQuestion where
15:15:16 <ChilliX> That's 200 machines, assuming none is down - we have bigger classes
15:15:31 <palomer> ChilliX: you dod it in shifts, of course
15:15:51 <ChilliX> palomer: Then, you need to set two exams and people will complain that the other one was easier
15:16:03 <shapr> Or use malcolm_'s idea of unique questions.
15:16:06 <ChilliX> (in fact, it may be a legal problem to set two different exams)
15:16:06 <palomer> say the exams last 2 hours, for 200 students that's 200/10 rooms, or 40 man hours
15:16:19 <palomer> ChilliX: oh, good point
15:16:35 <ChilliX> shapr: unique questions sounds good, but its hard comping up with one good set already
15:16:49 <ChilliX> I am not saying, the situation cannot be improved
15:16:53 <shapr> Could you get them to solve simple representative problems?
15:16:57 <ChilliX> but it's not *that* easy
15:17:09 <palomer> well, then, universities should keep their classes smaller or buy more computers!
15:17:20 <palomer> humph.
15:17:23 <ChilliX> palomer: I am all for that; especially, the former
15:17:47 <shapr> I wrote a simple webapp that used the Grammatical Framework to train and test Swedish.
15:17:59 <shapr> Of course, Grammatical Framework does all that for me, so I just added markup...
15:18:02 <malcolm_> ChilliX: are you still teaching >1000 students at one time?
15:18:16 <ChilliX> malcolm_: no, luckily not anymore
15:18:37 <palomer> or, here's a workaround
15:18:38 <ChilliX> nice to be able to fit all students in one room ;)
15:18:48 <palomer> split the class up into 10 sections
15:18:50 <shapr> The QuotesPage has some classic quotes from former students of ChilliX
15:18:54 <palomer> different sections have different exams at my school
15:19:03 <palomer> problem solved!
15:19:07 <palomer> (you can then curve the marks)
15:19:17 <shapr> It sounds like ChilliX has to make a new test for each section.
15:19:34 <SlowByte> hmm, Grammatical Framework looks interesting
15:19:34 <palomer> shapr: randomly chosen from a pool of questions
15:19:39 <palomer> like what  malcolm_ said
15:20:20 <palomer> universities could share in their question pool
15:20:23 <ChilliX> sections?
15:20:31 <palomer> in fact, the question pool SHOULD be given to the students before the exam as practice!
15:20:43 <palomer> ChilliX: yeah, subdivision of classes
15:20:58 <shapr> Oh, I'm starting a collection of monad implementations. So far I have C++, Java, Joy, OCaml, Perl, Prolog (sort of), Python, Ruby, and Scheme. Can anyone point me to implementations in languages that I haven't seen yet?
15:20:59 <palomer> for example, for course comp 201 there are like 5 sections
15:21:30 <malcolm_> shapr: you seem to be missing haskell on that list...
15:21:40 <shapr> malcolm_: I've seen a bit of that already :-)
15:21:59 <shapr> Haskell is obviously the native language of monads ;-)
15:22:22 <palomer> http://csus.cs.mcgill.ca/wiki/COMP-302 <--on the bottom of the page is what my students think about me
15:23:05 <ski> lambdaProlog http://logic.csci.unt.edu/tarau/research/PapersHTML/monadic.html ..
15:23:35 <shapr> ski: I've seen that one, but it appears to be an extended version of Prolog. Is that true?
15:23:41 <shapr> palomer: no connect
15:23:42 <ChilliX> palomer: ging questions out before has pros and cons; tends to encourage memoisation
15:23:50 * shapr snickers
15:24:11 <palomer> ChilliX: ging questions?
15:24:26 <palomer> ChilliX: you release 1000 questions and you say "you'll be tested on 5 of these"
15:24:28 <shapr> giving*
15:24:28 <ChilliX> ging = giving
15:25:04 <ChilliX> (a) Who is going to come up with 1000 questions and (b) why give them out?
15:25:23 <ski> state monad in Clean http://www.cs.ru.nl/~clean/Download/Download_Libraries/Std_Env/StdFunc/stdfunc.html
15:25:24 <ChilliX> Have you ever set exam questions? Do you know how long it takes to come up wuth 10 good ones?
15:25:32 <ChilliX> wuth = with
15:25:33 <shapr> ski: Good find!
15:25:34 <palomer> a) inter university cooperation and b) to give the students a chance to practice
15:25:38 <malcolm_> QuickCheck!
15:25:50 <ski> shapr : lambdaProlog is a logic programming language, related to prolog
15:25:57 * shapr hugs QuickCheck
15:25:57 <ChilliX> (a) courses are too different
15:26:12 <ChilliX> (b) is fine, but doesn't require the same Qs in the exam
15:26:26 <palomer> b) you lose nothing by having the Qs in the  exam
15:26:38 <ChilliX> that's true
15:26:52 <palomer> a) there are so many universities, I'm sure you can find any course in 20 other universities
15:26:54 <ChilliX> but I'd quite before agreeing to produce 100 questions
15:26:56 * malcolm_ spent about 40 hours to devise a 1.5 hour exam with 3 questions
15:26:58 <ChilliX> 1000
15:26:59 <palomer> unless they're graduate courses
15:27:28 <ChilliX> (a) course with the same title, yes; some content, no
15:27:35 <ChilliX> some = same
15:27:35 <palomer> for the first year course, you could probably find it in hundreds of other universities
15:27:51 <shapr> Maybe give small groups of students the task to come up with a working solution to a simple problem?
15:27:56 <palomer> ChilliX: well, you'd simply browse what the university has to offer and decide if you want to use their test questions
15:28:02 <ChilliX> nah, people routinely write their own textbooks, because they can't even agree on those
15:28:09 * shapr laughs
15:28:24 <ski> (shapr : 'seqList' in that Clean module, is basically haskell's 'sequence' specialized to state monad .. and 'seq' is almost 'sequence_' (also note that these allow update-in-place of state, because of uniqueness/linearity))
15:28:45 <shapr> Similarly, there's solid ideological disagreement on #haskell about some points.
15:28:51 <shapr> AGs versus Monads for example.
15:29:19 * ski wonders who disagrees with who
15:29:57 * malcolm_ disagrees with ski :-)
15:30:02 <ski> ty
15:30:12 <sethk> I disagree with everybody about everything
15:30:18 <shapr> sethk: No you don't!
15:30:54 * ski almost asks sethk : even yourself .. ?
15:30:57 * ChilliX brews some green tea now.
15:31:04 <sethk> shapr, ski, argumentative, aren't we   :)
15:31:27 <shapr> I enjoy humorous scripted response like "Are you deaf?" "What?" and "You're being defensive!" "No I'm not!".
15:31:30 <sethk> however, I won't lower myself to addressing the lier's paradox
15:31:43 * shapr drinks Jolt cola
15:32:13 * ski has a can of jolt he's spared some 3 or 4 years ..
15:32:25 <ChilliX> Was in Japan recently and brought tons of green tea :)
15:32:46 <shapr> Oh hey, one thought running around in my head for months is wonderment of the duality of SVN and darcs, and whether or not that maps onto the possible duality of Zippers and comonads.
15:33:19 * ski had one more, but the content mysteriously leaked out, even though i could find no hole
15:33:37 <shapr> SVN is roughly based on a zipper, and is roughly the dual of darcs. So I wonder, is there a good way to formalize darcs' patch theory with comonads?
15:33:37 <ski> zippers and comonads ?
15:33:44 <sethk> ski, that's because jolt has a combination of caffeine and battery acid
15:33:51 * shapr charges!
15:33:52 <ski> why should those be dual ?
15:34:32 <ski> sethk : hm .. reminds me of grog ..
15:34:34 <shapr> I don't know, I'm not sure they are. I know they're not perfect duals, but I think there's some relation.
15:34:40 <ski> (.. monkey island)
15:35:31 * ski should really leave for night
15:36:14 <ski> (stop talking about interesting things .. so i can go to sleep .. .. .. :)
15:36:45 * ski realizes his wish is prolly impossible to be fulfilled
15:41:43 <liyang> What's the current status with JaffaCake's binary IO library? The link from @hawiki BinaryIo is broken... and he doesn't link to it from his page.
15:41:56 <liyang> s/JaffaCake/Simon Marlow/
15:41:59 <dons> you could use NewBinary, liyang
15:44:56 <liyang> it's huuuuuge...
15:45:34 <liyang> I'm just currently doing the insane thing of reading in Chars and mapping each one to a Word8.
15:45:49 <dons> hmm. newBinary is huge, you mean?
15:45:53 <liyang> (file opened in bin mode, of course.)
15:45:55 <liyang> Yup.
15:46:08 <dons> it's not really. I use it in many projects. just rip out Binary.hs and FastMutInt.hs
15:46:21 <dons> or take them from say, lambdabot
15:46:33 <dons> @version
15:46:34 <lambdabot> lambdabot 3p196, GHC 6.5.20050806 (Linux i686)
15:46:34 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/lambdabot
15:47:24 <liyang> It doesn't matter too much. I just want a lazy list of Word8s from a given file and that can be rewritten using a different IO library at a few minutes's notice.
15:48:50 <dons> oh, then: liftM map (fromIntegral.ord) $ hGetContents myhandle  ?
16:00:01 <liyang> getFileContents f = fmap (map (fromIntegral . ord)) $ openBinaryFile f ReadMode >>= hGetContents
16:00:04 <liyang> was what I had. :)
16:00:26 <dons> :)
16:00:49 <liyang> It'll do for now. :-/
16:15:16 <astrolabe> Is there a function which finds the largest element in a list?
16:15:37 <Lemmih> @type maximum
16:15:38 <lambdabot> forall a. (Ord a) => [a] -> a
16:15:48 <astrolabe> Thanks
16:28:47 <dash> hrrm 
16:28:59 <dash> more haskell knowledge seems to have fallen out of my head than i thought
16:29:12 <dash> @type Data.Map.lookup
16:29:13 <lambdabot> forall a (m :: * -> *) k.
16:29:13 <lambdabot> (Ord k, Monad m) =>
16:29:13 <lambdabot> k -> Data.Map.Map k a -> m a
16:29:33 <dash> how do I call that in a way that makes sense
16:29:50 <dash> if I do 'lookup 1 (singleton 1 "hooj")'
16:29:55 <dash> i get 'unresolved overloading'
16:31:09 <dash> i guess i need to pass the result to bind?
16:33:43 <Lemmih> > M.lookup 1 (M.singleton 1 "hooj") :: Maybe String
16:33:45 <lambdabot> Just "hooj"
16:34:04 <Lemmih> > M.lookup 1 (M.singleton 1 "hooj") :: [] String
16:34:05 <lambdabot> ["hooj"]
16:34:55 <dash> of course
16:35:15 <dash> so 'fromMaybe "" (lookup ...)'
16:36:49 <Lemmih> > M.singleton 1 "hooj" M.! 1
16:36:51 <lambdabot> "hooj"
16:36:57 <shapr> Lemmih: Are there other plugs builtin bindings? When did "import qualified Data.Map as M" get added?
16:37:27 <dash> Lemmih: yeah, but i want to deal with nonexistent entries 
16:38:00 <Lemmih> oh right. Misread fromMaybe as fromJust /-:
16:38:03 <dash> i'm trying to parse URLs
16:38:13 <shapr> dash: Why not just use the HTTP library?
16:38:13 <Lemmih> shapr: I don't know.
16:38:21 <dash> shapr: 'cos they aren't HTTP URLs :)
16:38:30 <shapr> What sort of urls?
16:38:31 <dash> URIs i guess I oughta say
16:38:40 <dash> shapr: SIP! :D
16:38:58 <dash> so i think i got a handle on the parsing end of things, via parsec
16:39:10 <dash> deciding how to represent it after parsing is less obvious
16:39:14 <shapr> The existing URI parser may handle that.
16:39:21 <dash> shapr: ohhh reallllly
16:39:40 * dash suspects he can build valid ones that break it
16:39:44 <shapr> @google haskell uri parser
16:39:45 <lambdabot> http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/ReadMe-URI-Haskell.txt
16:40:09 <shapr> Could be, but Graham Klyne tends to use the W3C test suites on his software.
16:40:20 <dash> yeah
16:40:41 <dash> probably insufficient for my purposes
16:41:00 <dash> hmm so this is not Network.URI
16:41:01 <dash> ok
16:41:31 <shapr> Does SIP fit into RFC2396bis?
16:42:04 <Lemmih> What does GHC build in stage 1, 2 and 3?
16:42:10 <dash> shapr: yeah, it oughta
16:42:52 <shapr> Lemmih: iirc, stage 1 builds the compiler from another version, stage 2 builds the rest of the compiler from itself, and I forget what's in stage 3.
16:42:57 <shapr> Maybe ghci and profiling libs?
16:43:23 <Lemmih> Thanks.
16:48:42 <dash> shapr: here is an example
16:49:10 <dash> 'sip:613@69.90.155.70;ftag=768064993;lr'
16:50:23 <shapr> Does it work with that URI parser?
16:50:55 <dash> well, not sure yet
16:51:03 <dash> still fiddling with it
16:52:09 <dash> hm.
16:52:11 <dash> @type isSpace
16:52:12 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `isSpace'
16:52:19 <dash> yeah, that's what hugs says here too
16:52:43 <Lemmih> @type Data.Char.isSpace
16:52:44 <lambdabot> Char -> Bool
16:53:12 <dash> hmmh. guess it's old code
16:59:08 <dash> shapr: Heh, here is what it does
16:59:09 <dash> URI> parseURIRef "sip:613@69.90.155.70;ftag=768064993;lr"
16:59:09 <dash> [("sip:613@69.90.155.70;ftag=768064993;lr","")]
16:59:26 <dash> "it's all one piece!"
17:00:05 <dash> so, in one sense you could say it parses it
17:00:13 <dash> in another, it /totally/ doesn't
17:00:18 <shapr> Are you sure that's not just the Show instance?
17:00:36 <dash> URI> :type parseURIRef "sip:613@69.90.155.70;ftag=768064993;lr"
17:00:37 <dash> parseURIRef "sip:613@69.90.155.70;ftag=768064993;lr" :: [(String,[Char])]
17:00:45 <dash> so probably not
17:01:05 <shapr> hiya droundy 
17:02:44 <shapr> Truly, it appears to just return a string. That's strange.
17:04:03 <shapr> The code appears to cut it apart...
17:04:21 <dash> i don't know if there's a function i should be calling instead
17:04:55 <dash> ah
17:04:57 <dash> getURIRef
17:04:59 <shapr> URI is defined in ParseURI
17:05:17 <shapr> Components are: scheme authority [segments] query fragment
17:05:41 <dash> right
17:05:42 <dash> not enough!
17:06:22 <shapr> At least it gives you a nice start :-)
17:06:29 <shapr> I'm sure you can extend it to do what you want.
17:06:36 <dash> yeah
17:07:01 <dash> the question is how to represent optional parameters
17:07:20 <Frederick> SamB, are you alive?
17:08:16 <dash> shapr: SIP is pretty crazy
17:08:16 <shapr> dash: You may want to look through "@google filetype:hs parse uri" first.
17:09:48 <dash> shapr: you can put crap on a URI ~.
17:10:40 <Frederick> folks is paste.lisp.org offline?
17:10:57 <dash> errr
17:11:05 <dash> (my dhcp lease expired)
17:11:27 <dash> shapr: you can put crap on a URI that gets interpreted by the SIP element as extra headers
17:11:45 <dash> sorta like http-equiv! but in the URI instead
17:15:53 <Frederick> ski, are you gone?
17:25:40 <dash> hmm
17:25:53 <dash> i see how to do labelled field update
17:26:04 <dash> how do you do labellied field lookup, though
17:26:15 * dash feels kinda dense today
17:26:52 <SlowByte> what's the relationship between category theory and (binary) relations? (if that's relevant)
17:28:33 <Frederick> SlowByte, category theory is a lie
17:29:34 <SlowByte> in what sense? :)
17:30:17 <Frederick> SlowByte, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_Theory
17:30:38 <Frederick> SlowByte, category = "generalized abstract nonsense"
17:31:48 <SlowByte> yeah, I've seen that
17:34:15 <SlowByte> actually, that question wasn't properly constructed
17:49:15 <Frederick> SlowByte, what do you mean?
17:53:48 <SlowByte> oh, I don't know really, I'm looking for interesting morphisms of (the category of?) relations
17:55:34 <SlowByte> say, hmm, graphs should be isomorphic to binary relations over the nodes
17:56:15 <SlowByte> not sure if that makes sense
17:58:36 <dons> hmm. It really pays to have your threads respect ThreadKilled exceptions
18:08:43 <SlowByte> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(disambiguation)
18:08:46 <SlowByte> interesting variety ;)
18:09:54 <shapr> Is TopMind listed? :-)
18:10:11 <SlowByte> hehe, good point
18:10:17 <ricebowl> quite odd
18:10:29 <dash> huh
18:10:33 <ricebowl> shapr - dunno if it means anything to you, but Happy Thanksgiving eh :p
18:10:51 <dash> i was _sure_ i saw a numeric parser in the prelude once upon a time 
18:11:28 <SlowByte> I actually agree with topmind in a number of things
18:11:48 <SlowByte> I don't know if that should scare me
18:12:49 <ccshan> @eval read "3.245e5" / 1000
18:12:51 <lambdabot> 324.5
18:13:25 <ricebowl> @eval Numeric.readDec "200 abc"
18:13:26 <lambdabot> [(200," abc")]
18:13:35 <shapr> ricebowl: Why wouldn't it mean anything to me?
18:13:43 <shapr> SlowByte: I'm scared!
18:13:54 <ricebowl> shapr - are you a Swede or an American? ...or neither?
18:14:01 <shapr> I'm from Alabama.
18:14:04 <ricebowl> I know
18:14:08 * ricebowl shrugs
18:14:09 <Korollary> lol
18:14:16 <ricebowl> well I live here and don't self-identify as American :p
18:14:20 <shapr> I lived in the USA for 27 years or so.
18:14:21 <ricebowl> I figured you might be the same
18:14:40 <dons>  shapr lives in #haskell, didn't you know? He's a haskellian.
18:14:46 <ricebowl> haha
18:14:46 <SlowByte> shapr: you're old :)
18:14:54 <shapr> I like the USA. I'd like to go back too, but not while those unusually stupid laws are in place.
18:15:10 <ricebowl> shapr - heh ;) don't think they'll be repealed any time soon
18:15:16 <ricebowl> I'd like to "escape", but not for political reasons
18:15:30 <shapr> Hopefully the patent system and the music industry will go down in a pile of screaming lawyers.
18:15:55 <ricebowl> shapr - in case you didn't notice, Congress is funded by business concerns
18:16:11 <ricebowl> RIAA and such have a number of puppets
18:16:13 <SlowByte> continuing in my current direction, I'm probably going to inflict relational justice upon the world soon
18:16:16 * ricebowl shrugs
18:16:23 <ricebowl> we're screwed :(
18:16:25 <Korollary> SlowByte: ?
18:16:42 <shapr> I was listening to the Edison cylinder recordings stream earlier. Theodore Roosevelt made the point that soldiers and leaders were willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of their people.
18:17:05 <SlowByte> Korollary: aka design a language that has an unhealthy dosage of relational-ness :)
18:17:32 <ricebowl> SlowByte - human or machine?
18:17:35 <shapr> At some point the US Citizens will realize that they're all stockholders in the USA, and that the board of directors is screwing them over.
18:17:42 <Korollary> SlowByte: I am not sure a relation is a powerful enough concept to play a major role.
18:17:49 <SlowByte> machine, of course ;)
18:17:58 <ricebowl> shapr - naw, the average citizen just wants the status quo to stay the same
18:18:19 <SlowByte> Korollary: err, functions are a subset of relations so.. hmm? :)
18:18:27 <dons> gives you a different perspective, living in the eu, shapr?
18:18:35 <ricebowl> shapr - so long as we keep getting our cheap crap from China, we're happy
18:18:40 <shapr> Makes me wonder if the programmer's stone really is true...
18:19:04 <shapr> Do we have a society based on being Ritual Addicted?
18:19:10 <ricebowl> heh so long as people can still buy their SUVs and so forth.
18:19:19 <shapr> dons: Yeah, but I had a different perspective beforehand, otherwise I wouldn't have left.
18:19:36 <dons> yeah, right.
18:19:44 <shapr> dons: When I did leave, most of my friends said "Wow, you're just up and moving! I wish I could do that!" and I said, "You can. Just do it."
18:19:52 <dons> hehe
18:20:06 <dons> some people are like that though.
18:20:34 <shapr> Fear change? Only see options that are obvious? What is that exactly?
18:20:45 <dons> I had similar friends in the small town I grew up in, who just couldn't imagine leaving, it was all too hard for them.
18:20:50 <dash> shapr: stockholders? i think you mean "serfs" :)
18:21:10 <ricebowl> shapr - how did you find a job over there?
18:21:20 <ricebowl> that's really the only reason why I don't
18:21:36 * ricebowl would move to Argentina
18:21:59 <syntaxfree> holla to the newest graduate student in the room.
18:22:03 <shapr> ricebowl: I just showed up and started looking.
18:22:04 <ChilliX> ricebowl: where are you from?
18:22:18 <shapr> syntaxfree: Cool, you got into the math program?
18:22:29 <syntaxfree> shapr: not yet. But I got accepted in an economics program.
18:22:33 <shapr> spiffy!
18:22:35 <syntaxfree> If I am accepted in the math program, I'm so there.
18:22:42 <syntaxfree> it's not one of my A-list schools, but it's something.
18:22:47 <syntaxfree> I can't see myself outside academia.
18:22:56 <shapr> I can't see myself inside academia.
18:23:10 <ricebowl> ChilliX - I live in Florida in the US
18:23:13 * SlowByte decided to be an autodidact, for better or for worse
18:23:15 <Korollary> serenity now
18:23:17 <palomer> academia is starting to bore me
18:23:19 <shapr> SlowByte: Me too.
18:23:21 <syntaxfree> Actually, I can see myself as a small-time entrepreneur doing very complex quantitative analysis for very special applications.
18:23:38 <syntaxfree> palomer: I'm way way bored with academia, but I really don't belong elsewhere.
18:23:41 <shapr> ricebowl: I lived in Clearwater for a few years.
18:23:47 <ChilliX> ricebowl: You just live there or are from there?
18:23:51 <syntaxfree> Except, perhaps, as a lottery winner, living with the girlfriend.
18:23:59 <ricebowl> shapr - ooh my appologies; we don't particularly want the Scientologists :p
18:24:10 <shapr> I don't think they were there at the time.
18:24:12 <ricebowl> ChilliX - could say that I'm from here; have been here for 17 years
18:24:18 <ricebowl> shapr - how long ago?
18:24:24 <syntaxfree> This is really not the right planet for me. It's not my world, I just live in it.
18:24:32 <shapr> hm.. 25 years ago?
18:24:35 <syntaxfree> Academia keeps me the furthest away from the ickiness of the real world.
18:24:43 <shapr> syntaxfree: So make it your world.
18:24:51 <shapr> C'mon, stop whining and fix the things you see wrong :-P
18:25:19 <shapr> Look at Linux, it's an inspirational example.
18:25:56 <shapr> syntaxfree: Of course, just before you got here we were discussing something like this...
18:26:00 * Korollary wants to become a ghostbuster
18:26:52 * shapr wants to learn and do cool stuff.
18:27:05 <ricebowl> shapr - oh, well, I don't know about that long since I'm not even 25 years old...
18:27:15 <palomer> linux is an inspirational pile of dung
18:27:26 <ricebowl> shapr - Linux as an inspirational example? ;)
18:27:28 <ricebowl> haha
18:27:44 <SlowByte> hey, at least you've got something to improve on ;)
18:28:08 <palomer> syntaxfree: ever thought of manual labour?
18:28:12 <palomer> don't knock it until you try it
18:28:21 <shapr> Hey, when I was sixteen, compilers cost hundreds of dollars. I wasn't even able to steal a compiler for my 4.77MHz IBM XT.
18:28:23 <ChilliX> inspirational enough...runs my computer
18:28:36 <palomer> ChilliX: so does does 6.2
18:28:38 * shapr does the 'when I was your age' bit.
18:28:40 <ricebowl> shapr - what does that have to do with Linux?
18:28:42 <palomer> s/dos/does
18:28:58 <syntaxfree> I remember my 4.77 IBM XT.
18:29:05 <syntaxfree> It didn't have ANY programming languages.
18:29:12 <syntaxfree> Not even BASICA or GW-BASIC.
18:29:17 <syntaxfree> So... I wrote games with batch files.
18:29:19 <ChilliX> palomer: Well, it actually does (as opposed to cpuld do).
18:29:24 <shapr> ricebowl: I desperately wanted to learn to program, but was unable to do so. You have access to homebuilt operating systems, what's your excuse? ;-)
18:29:24 <ChilliX> could
18:29:33 <SlowByte> I have an 4.77MHz semi-XT compatible palmtop in my drawer!
18:29:36 <syntaxfree> No, really. I changed the prompt, and every command in an adventure game was a separate batch file.
18:29:39 <ChilliX> syntaxfree: lol
18:29:48 <syntaxfree> You do realize how limited MS-DOS batch files are, right?
18:29:48 <shapr> syntaxfree: smooth!
18:30:04 <palomer> they're turing complete. what more do you want?
18:30:11 <syntaxfree> no, they're not.
18:30:13 <shapr> I read Peter Norton's Powertools books and tried to write programs with debug.exe
18:30:17 <palomer> back in my day, we didn't need compilers!
18:30:20 <syntaxfree> I didn't have any books.
18:30:20 <ChilliX> syntaxfree: Oh, I believe it, I am just amused :)
18:30:28 <syntaxfree> I figure it all on my own.
18:30:35 <syntaxfree> I didn't know there was a NUL device.
18:30:35 <shapr> syntaxfree: impressive
18:30:43 <syntaxfree> I kept writing trash files with names like "Mozart".
18:30:53 <syntaxfree> because I didn't want the actual output from the files.
18:31:02 <syntaxfree> One day, I got CHOICE.EXE in a magazine diskette.
18:31:10 * shapr remebers choice.exe
18:31:13 <syntaxfree> CHOICE.EXE had a [Y/N] prompt and returned an errorlevel according to that.
18:31:15 <syntaxfree> OH, BOY. 
18:31:19 <SlowByte> syntaxfree: hey, that's *too* familiar... I used to code in batch when I was a kid :)
18:31:20 <syntaxfree> Was I happy.
18:31:42 <ChilliX> And now you have got Haskell and are screwed ;)
18:31:45 <palomer> atari basic 4 ever!
18:31:56 <shapr> I also used choice.exe for batch files. I wrote menu systems for my parents, friends, etc
18:31:58 <syntaxfree> OH.
18:32:15 <syntaxfree> and I supposedly had a ZX Spectrum, except I could never make it work with my tv.
18:32:19 <palomer> I was watching teenage mutant ninja turtles
18:32:21 <syntaxfree> But I learned ZX Spectrum BASIC.
18:32:37 <syntaxfree> And wrote BASIC programs in a notebook, dreaming of the day rainfall would bring me a BASIC interpreter.
18:32:49 <syntaxfree> This was Brazil in the 1980s.
18:32:59 <syntaxfree> No Internet. No BBSes. I didn't even knew anyone who owned a computer.
18:33:11 <shapr> Luckily for me, my spectrum did work with my computer. It even had the ram expansion cartridge!
18:33:22 <palomer> and you had to walk 4 miles to the nearest well
18:33:37 * syntaxfree sings-screams "Booooooooorn to be wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiild"
18:34:30 <shapr> Anyway, if you don't like the way Linux does something, fix it.
18:34:41 <Korollary> hubuntu !
18:34:55 <syntaxfree> if you don't like the way Linux does something, get a Mac mini.
18:35:03 <shapr> I didn't like the state of documentation when I joined the Haskell community, and I'm still doing something about it.
18:35:09 <SlowByte> what if you don't like the mini? ;)
18:35:25 <syntaxfree> I did all the Linux kiddie trip. I might have been quoted in funroll-loops.org and don't remember saying things.
18:35:43 <syntaxfree> I remember installing every new minor version of the love-sources kernel.
18:35:50 <shapr> My philosophy is, "Lead, Follow, or get out of the Way!"
18:36:07 <syntaxfree> I got out of the way.
18:36:12 <shapr> syntaxfree: Ah, but now you are on #haskell ... have you read TaPL?
18:36:21 <syntaxfree> TaPL?
18:36:27 <shapr> Types and Programming Languages
18:36:37 <syntaxfree> Not really.
18:36:48 <syntaxfree> I was studying category theory, and someone pointed out Haskell had something to do with it.
18:36:54 <SlowByte> oh, hmm, reminds me, I should finish reading that
18:37:02 <shapr> If you choose the economic graduate program, you could use SPJ's financial combinators.
18:37:03 <syntaxfree> I dropped cat theory after two weeks, and haven't gotten to the Haskell-cat theory connection yet.
18:37:19 <shapr> Have you seen SPJ's financial combinators paper?
18:37:20 <syntaxfree> I was writing a library of financial combinators myself. 
18:37:26 <syntaxfree> It sounds fascinating.
18:37:27 <shapr> Is the source online?
18:37:37 <syntaxfree> nah, it's not even typed down.
18:37:40 <syntaxfree> It's all on paper.
18:37:47 <shapr> Transcribe it!
18:37:52 <syntaxfree> I spend too much time away from a computer.
18:37:59 <SlowByte> but I've still got "The Art of Prolog" and "Thinking in Forth" in the queue :\
18:38:15 <syntaxfree> It might be good for my math program application letter to mention SPJ's financial combinators paper.
18:38:26 <syntaxfree> It at least would make some sense of me having gotten my BS in economcis.
18:38:27 <shapr> I'm looking forward to the completion of conjure, I have a neat idea for a p2p DNS system.
18:39:52 <syntaxfree> My undergrad program ends next week.
18:40:00 <syntaxfree> I'm not even motivated to have high scores in the final exams.
18:40:19 <syntaxfree> My math program application won't depend on it.
18:40:40 <syntaxfree> Application deadline ends before exams are graded.
18:41:29 * syntaxfree is relieved. He can begin reading phdcomics.com again without feeling sad about all the rejections ;-)
18:42:33 * syntaxfree buys everyone in the room a beer.
18:43:07 * benny chugs
18:44:00 <syntaxfree> I'm a grad student. Jesus, I'm a grad student.
18:44:10 <syntaxfree> I wish I could call my girlfriend. She's in the bus to see me, though.
18:44:13 <syntaxfree> It's a six hour trip.
18:44:18 <syntaxfree> She'll be here by the morning.
18:44:42 <dons> congratulates syntaxfree.  now you get to read "PhD Comics"  :)
18:44:57 <syntaxfree> I used to read phdcomics dreaming of grad school.
18:45:04 <syntaxfree> But I stopped as the rejection started coming in.
18:45:05 <dons> hehe
18:45:55 <syntaxfree> In Brazil, there's a nation-wide exam for economics programs.
18:46:03 <syntaxfree> I mostly flunked it, but a B-list school took me.
18:46:13 <syntaxfree> At least I get a grant, a lab and peace of mind for an extra two years.
18:46:28 <syntaxfree> I'm hoping the applied maths school I'm applying to takes me.
18:50:50 <shapr> YURLs are nifty.
18:51:09 <syntaxfree> yahoo url's?
18:51:11 <syntaxfree> yes, some are.
18:51:18 <syntaxfree> I'm using Yahoo for a month as an experiment.
18:51:25 <tennin> what are they?
18:51:27 <syntaxfree> I want to see what google "feels like" after that.
18:51:34 <shapr> Nah, yurl.net redirectory.
18:52:03 <syntaxfree> huh?
18:52:24 <shapr> Darius Bacon mentioned YURLs to me when I described a peer to peer DNS idea I had recently -  http://www.scannedinavian.com/2005-11-24.html
18:52:55 <shapr> The whole ICANN fiasco is irritating me, so I want a DNS system that works like ant trails.
18:53:11 <tennin> yeah
18:54:21 <tennin> i had an idea to use IM/IRC handles as URLs
18:54:36 <shapr> It's a bit like a formalized system for fads, a bit like tagging, and something else.
18:54:39 <shapr> Yeah, that's a good idea.
18:54:47 <tennin> like htim:yahoo:tennin
18:54:59 <tennin> it's probably retarded but it seemed cool to me
18:55:05 <syntaxfree> hmm. web 2.0 goodiness?
18:55:26 <shapr> Nothing to do with web 2.0, but interesting even so.
18:55:40 <shapr> So of course, I want to try to implement this with Haskell...
18:56:17 <shapr> Though it goes on the end of my project queue, right under darcsforge.
18:56:49 <shapr> Is there an existing triple store for Haskell?
18:58:19 <tennin> it seemed like the HTIM thing could be done with a web browser plugin + IM client plugin + web server module
19:00:10 <shapr> I've been using privoxy lately, and I discovered you can make 'hidden' websites with tor as long as you configure privoxy to talk to tor for certain urls. I think the pattern of a local smart web proxy will become popular.
19:00:31 <shapr> You could probably hack privoxy to do what you want in a few days.
19:01:51 <shapr> syntaxfree: Have you written any Haskell code lately?
19:02:09 <tennin> or tie it in with a DNS server, and all your friends get their own top-level domain
19:03:00 <tennin> tie that in with something like del.icio.us or some fancier semantic-web thing, and your friends' tags would be the domains in that TLD
19:03:13 <tennin> but now i'm just mentally wanking
19:03:20 <shapr> It's a good idea.
19:04:20 <tennin> wanna collaborate on it?
19:04:22 <shapr> The generalization is something like 'namespaces.' Where part of your namespace is a reference to the namespace of others.
19:04:39 <shapr> I don't have time right now, sorry.
19:04:47 <tennin> neither do i
19:04:57 <shapr> Too many other projects, too much work.
19:05:03 <tennin> it's pretty far back in my project queue as well
19:05:27 <tennin> so maybe we'll both get to it around the same time
19:05:47 <syntaxfree> shapr: I actually dropped haskell'ing around a couple of weeks ago.
19:05:58 <syntaxfree> I'm in final exams.
19:06:02 <syntaxfree> Last exams I need to graduate.
19:06:22 <shapr> Well, come back to it soon, it's great fun!
19:10:34 <syntaxfree> yes, it is.
19:11:18 <syntaxfree> I'm a grad student. Yay for me!
19:17:58 <shapr> Have any of you read this nutty rebelscience website? There's an article on 'why software is bad' that essentially says once software works like hardware, everything will be fixed. It says that dataflow languages like Esterel and Synchrone are the Silver Bullet we've been ignoring.
19:20:20 <tennin> the "once software works like hardware..." thing has been around for decades, hasn't it?
19:20:38 <dons> oh, thiis is a nice trick:
19:20:39 <dons>          iterate2 f x n | seq f $ seq x $ seq n $ False = undefined
19:20:39 <dons>          iterate2 f x n = --- as before
19:20:58 <dons> from "How to make a function strict without changing its body
19:21:52 <shapr> tennin: Yeah, and it's total _|_
20:36:22 <dons> @seen SamB
20:36:22 <lambdabot> SamB is in #haskell-blah, #haskell-overflow and #haskell. I don't know
20:36:22 <lambdabot> when SamB last spoke.
20:36:51 <dons> SamB, some new patches have landed in the last few days to hmp3, if you could give them a spin, that'd be cool :)
20:46:57 <dash> man
20:47:07 <dash> how do i get at two namespaces at once in hugs

20:50:39 <Korollary> in ghci you can do ":m+ NewMod"

23:17:08 <fanopnaic> /win17
23:17:15 <fanopnaic> wrong window.
23:17:27 <luqui> what are associated types?
23:18:06 <TheHunter> http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/assoc-types/
23:19:47 <luqui> neat
23:20:29 <dons> TheHunter, nope. in the associated-types branch
23:20:42 <dons> well , sort of, I guess. but not yet in the head
23:22:26 <TheHunter> ah, thanks.
23:22:34 <xerox> Howdy.
23:22:42 <TheHunter> moin
23:25:56 <aleator> Someone should really make a point about starting to remove features from ghc..
23:26:19 <dons> they do get removed occasionally.
23:27:16 <luqui> why?
23:27:31 <xerox> To make TheHunter cry :-)
23:27:41 <Cale> xerox: haha
23:28:09 <aleator> Basicly, because large languages are by definition not very nice thing. 
23:28:44 <Cale> most of GHC's features are on switches anyway
23:29:09 <dons> yeah, soo no one cares about, say, ugly implict paramms, since they aren't forced to use them
23:29:21 <dons> hey Cale, how's code?
23:30:01 <aleator> Does anyone actually use implicit params?
23:30:20 <TheHunter> Check out lambdabot :)
23:31:20 <aleator> Hmm.. Is there any ghc feature not used in lambdabot?
23:31:43 <TheHunter> linear implicit parameters.
23:32:04 <Cale> dons: Haven't written too much lately
23:32:26 <dons> funnily enough, I recall SPJ saying "GHC is now full", then he added GADTs
23:32:39 <TheHunter> overlapping/undecidable instances ?
23:32:56 <dons> oh, maybe. but i'm sure we could write a plugin that uses them
23:33:46 <dons> it would be fun to see the lambdabot plugin that uses the most type system features 
23:33:50 <xerox> dons: Cale wrote an animation.hs with Cairo :-)
23:33:56 <dons> ah, cool.
23:34:00 <TheHunter> Lambda seems to use overlapping instances, but I think we could rid of that.
23:34:12 <Cale> Yeah, I did do that :)
23:34:59 * dons scrolls back through todays patches to try to work out where the space leak got introduced
23:35:27 <Cale> I've been thinking of creating a Haskell binding to the EFL, which is something I've considered doing for a while.
23:35:55 <Cale> (That's the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries)
23:36:12 <dons> hmm. that would be cool
23:36:21 <luqui> if you like Enlightenment...
23:36:23 <luqui> :-)
23:36:28 <dons> hey joelk, how's code these days?
23:36:32 <luqui> I'm a dark ages kinda guy myself
23:36:34 <palomer> What, who doesn't?
23:36:48 <dons> luqui, you tried hmp3 then?
23:36:56 <dons> you use ion?
23:37:07 <palomer> how much more processor does hmp3 take compared to similar C implementations?
23:37:09 <luqui> heh
23:37:17 <xerox> Bye folks!
23:37:20 <palomer> (could someone check?)
23:37:37 <dons> palomer. 0.0% ;)
23:37:47 <joelk> hi. nothing very interesting, but I've been using haskell for a lot of scripting I would have used Python for before... that's fun at least.
23:37:50 <dons> sleep    poll     0:00  0.00% hmp3
23:38:09 <dons> palomer, it's still using a C lib to do the decooding in the background
23:38:15 <palomer> dons: oh.
23:38:18 <palomer> that's not fair!
23:38:24 * dons shrugs
23:39:00 <Cale> hmp3 is a frontend for mpg321 and potentially other media players
23:39:07 <dons> right.
23:39:09 <TheHunter> @where hmp3
23:39:10 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hmp3
23:40:05 <dons> screenshot at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hmp3.html
23:40:26 <ValarQ> dons: hows hogg going?
23:40:37 <dons> I played around with ogg123
23:40:38 <dons> which is nice
23:40:49 <dons> but doesn't have a nice control protocol
23:40:59 <dons> so mmaybe mpd is the way to go
23:41:20 <TheHunter> didn't Igloo write a gstreamer binding once?
23:41:25 <dons> yeah.
23:41:31 <dons> that's another option
23:44:07 <TheHunter> does mpc support replaygain?
23:44:15 <TheHunter> *mpd
23:44:33 <dons> yep
23:45:11 <dons> whatever that is :)
23:47:39 <TheHunter> it adjusts the volumes of differnt songs.
23:47:52 <dons> ah, right.
23:50:06 <dhpeterson> can someone tell me the role of the "$" operator
23:50:26 <dons> @type ($)
23:50:27 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> a -> b
23:50:40 <dons> it's just lazy application, it's used to save on parenthesis
23:50:45 <luqui> dhpeterson, it is a right-assocative application
23:50:50 <dons> > id $ 3
23:50:51 <lambdabot> 3
23:50:55 <dons> > id $ 3 + 5
23:50:56 <lambdabot> 8
23:51:00 <dons> > id (3 + 5)
23:51:01 <lambdabot> 8
23:51:01 <dhpeterson> i tried to find it in Thomson's Haskell: The Craft ...
23:51:05 <luqui> so instead of saying "foo (bar baz)", you can say "foo $ bar baz"
23:51:12 <dhpeterson> ahh
23:51:15 <dhpeterson> so simple
23:51:30 <dhpeterson> no wonder it's used everywhere in the haskell code i'm reading (to try and learn the lang!)
23:51:39 <dons> you often see: Control.Exception.handle (\e -> do somthing) $ do ... 
23:51:42 <luqui> it's right-associative, so instead of "foo (bar baz (quux wofo))", you can say "foo $ bar baz $ quux wofo"
23:51:46 <dons> for the second, large argument to handle
23:51:58 <dhpeterson> aha
23:52:01 <dhpeterson> thanks guys
23:52:04 <dhpeterson> btw dons
23:52:07 <dons> and also,: withForeignPtr myval $ \ptr -> ....
23:52:15 <dhpeterson> i'm working through chak's iDoc.hs as an example of a self-contained haskell prog
23:52:22 <dons> ah, cool.
23:52:54 <dhpeterson> quite a head-stretch for an imperative programmer like me :)
23:53:20 <luqui> yeah, it is
23:53:20 <dhpeterson> but several times now, with iDoc and other haskell progs, i have seen statements that make me say "wow"
23:53:27 <dons> often fp seems that way, I guess. once you've got it, imperative programming feels just like a spcial case of fp
23:53:30 <dhpeterson> as you see just what can be done in a single line of well crafted fp
23:53:36 <dhpeterson> :)
23:53:41 <dhpeterson> i feel like i'm slowly getting it
23:53:50 <luqui> I really like the amazing ability to abstract
23:53:56 <luqui> which is built up from very simple concepts
23:53:57 <dons> you just have a lot lot more expressive power
23:54:07 <dhpeterson> i can see that
23:54:07 <luqui> whereas in most imperative languages, they give you a different "feature" for every abstraction mechanism
23:54:17 <dhpeterson> as someone who's done a fair bit of java, perl and C
23:54:20 <dhpeterson> yes
23:54:22 <dhpeterson> exactly
23:54:30 <dons> like java's crazy catch/try etc. which are just libraries in Haskell
23:54:30 <dhpeterson> perl gives you n features per abstraction, take your pick ;)
23:54:59 <dhpeterson> i do some consulting work to support myself
23:55:04 <dhpeterson> mostly java for small companies
23:55:16 <dhpeterson> 60% of java in most real code is just boiler-plate in my experience
23:55:21 <dhpeterson> over and over
23:55:34 <dhpeterson> i can see with haskell that boiler-plate is just gone
23:55:35 <xinming> hmm, a question about the /=, Why not use != by default istead of /= please?
23:55:38 <dhpeterson> and only expression remains
23:55:48 <dhpeterson> anyway, thanks guys .. thanks luqui
23:55:49 <dons> xinming, since ! isn't not in Haskell
23:56:05 <dhpeterson> xinming: heh i wondered about the same :)
23:56:09 <luqui> != would mean "strict equals" or something...
23:56:10 <dons>  != only makes sense if ! is not
23:56:18 <xinming> dons: what do you please?
23:56:34 <dons> whereas, since time immemorial, =/= is not equals in math
23:56:47 <dhpeterson> in iDoc ... (not . someBoolFn) is used often
23:56:59 <dhpeterson> i guess that's the "!"
23:57:07 <dons> > not False
23:57:08 <lambdabot> True
23:57:13 <dons> > not . not $ False
23:57:14 <lambdabot> False
23:57:23 <dhpeterson> heh
23:58:33 <dhpeterson> lisp needs a $ operator :)
23:58:41 <dons> oh boy does it
23:58:43 <dons> hehe
23:58:51 <dhpeterson> it just occured to me
23:58:56 <dhpeterson> lol
23:59:15 <tuomov> it would be cool to be able to use в‰  (unicode =/=)...
23:59:37 <dons> yeah, and I always wanted real lambdas
23:59:45 <dons> but this could just be a job for  the editor
23:59:57 <dons> ProofGeneral lets you use greek in Isabelle code
