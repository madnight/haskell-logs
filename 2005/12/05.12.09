00:02:39 <autrijus> is there a reasonable sparse array (in IO or preferably STM) implementation for Haskell?
00:12:04 <dcoutts> gour, I don't think any changes are needed for the wp-spamassassin plugin.
00:12:25 <dcoutts> gour, it should be working now. I've started the spamd daemon.
00:14:23 * Diablo-D3 is /still/ waiting for scp to complete
00:14:48 <JohnMeacham> does anyone know boxy types here?
00:15:50 <gour> dcoutts: thank you
00:16:07 <dcoutts> gour, I'm not totally conviced that it's going to work :-(
00:16:21 <gour> dcoutts: why not?
00:16:24 <dcoutts> gour, when I acticated the plugin the spamd process stopped
00:16:33 <dcoutts> I've re-started it but still...
00:16:54 <JohnMeacham> in particluar, the SPEC rule, surely it doesn't mean place a box in every spot, because the same box multile times in a term gets overwritten. perhaps there is some sort of implicit unification that needs to go on?
00:16:55 <dcoutts> gour, it needs testing, try posting a comment
00:18:09 <gour> dcoutts: ok, i have some more spam for moderating, let me post one of those :-)
00:18:36 <dcoutts> heh heh
00:18:48 <dcoutts> gour, and try a non-spam too
00:19:43 <dcoutts> gour, btw the pluging phph file is not writable by me so I can't adjust the config (although I havn't needed to yet)
00:21:08 <gour> dcoutts: i fixed perms
00:22:01 <gour> dcoutts: my attempt is blocked, have you changed option for # of links?
00:22:23 <gour> dcoutts: it's not
00:22:34 <gour> we have to change it..
00:22:59 <gour> dcoutts: what is the reasonable number?
00:24:00 <gour> dcoutts: another 5 spams, we're getting popular
00:55:30 <lispy> darc
00:55:32 <lispy> ah
00:55:36 <lispy> sorry
00:58:08 <Diablo-D3> yay
00:58:10 <Diablo-D3> finally uploaded
01:00:23 <gour> dcoutts: ping
01:01:51 <dcoutts> gour, I'm back
01:01:53 <Diablo-D3> question
01:02:05 <Diablo-D3> ghc's generic linux binary
01:02:20 <Diablo-D3> how do I... um... install it?
01:02:25 <dcoutts> dcoutts, the number of links option is still set to 0
01:02:37 <dcoutts> Diablo-D3, ./configure; make; make install
01:02:43 <Diablo-D3> seriously? thats it?
01:03:04 <jlouis> probably
01:04:10 <gour> dcoutts: how many links before moderation?
01:04:27 <dcoutts> gour, currently it's 0
01:04:43 * Diablo-D3 waits for it to install
01:04:49 <gour> dcoutts: yes, but it does not make sense with sa-plugin
01:04:55 <dcoutts> gour, "Hold a comment in the queue if it contains more than 0 links"
01:05:03 <dcoutts> gour, ok what should it be?
01:05:16 <gour> dcoutts: we want it to do the job instead of us
01:05:42 <dcoutts> gour, so what should the link setting be then?
01:05:51 <gour> dcoutts: i'm asking you for something reasonable in case the plugin does not catch it
01:06:01 <Diablo-D3> yes! it installed ghc!
01:06:17 <dcoutts> gour, so should I set it to 100?
01:06:21 <gour> dcoutts: 3,4,..
01:06:28 <dcoutts> ok, 3
01:06:37 <dcoutts> done
01:08:05 <gour> ok, let me spam..
01:13:40 <Diablo-D3> woohoo
01:13:43 * Diablo-D3 waits for darcs to build
01:14:04 <gour> dcoutts: it looks like 100 is better idea, 'cause 3 is too less, both of my comments are in a queue
01:14:12 <gour> dcoutts: let me try with 20
01:14:19 <dcoutts> gour, ok
01:21:35 <gour> dcoutts: all the spam-comments are put in a queue
01:21:48 <dcoutts> gour, oh
01:21:49 <gour> dcoutts: you didn't change anything in plugin source?
01:21:54 <dcoutts> gour, nope
01:25:27 <gour> dcoutts: can you check the source regarding the spamd & port?
01:25:57 <dcoutts> gour, it's using the right port number
01:26:03 <JohnMeacham> actually, if someone just can tell me formally what [a -> b]rho  with a line over the bracketed thing means? I thought I knew, but I think I might be wrong.
01:26:13 <dcoutts> gour, and that port is open on localhost
01:26:38 <gour> dcoutts: and localhost is mail server?
01:26:51 <dcoutts> gour, localhsot on haskell.org
01:27:24 <Itkovian> oooook ...
01:27:32 <gour> dcoutts: hmm, maybe it should be e.g. mail.haskell.org ?
01:27:45 <Itkovian> perl -e command -> how do I feed that command arguments?
01:27:53 <Diablo-D3> yay
01:27:53 <dcoutts> gour, but spamd is running on haskell.org
01:27:57 <Diablo-D3> darcs has been built!
01:28:15 <dcoutts> gour, and is only listening on localhost, not on the network
01:28:34 <gour> dcoutts: then it looks that those two lines has to be uncommented, afaics
01:28:57 <dcoutts> gour, they are uncommented, take a look
01:31:20 <gour> dcoutts: well, it looks it is vice versa, i.e. one line has to be uncommented, and two commented
01:31:36 <gour> if we are using spamd
01:32:10 <dcoutts> gour, nope. It's listening on a socket port 783 @ localhost
01:32:20 <dcoutts> it is not usign a unix domain socket
01:32:31 <dcoutts> /tmp/spamd.socket does not exist
01:32:45 <gour> hmm, what's wrong then?
01:33:23 <dcoutts> gour, it's definately listening, I can telnet localhost 783 and talk to spamd
01:33:32 <dcoutts> SPAMD/1.0 76 Bad header line: hello
01:33:32 <dcoutts> Connection closed by foreign host.
01:34:20 <gour> ok, i'll try again, i disabled that #oflinks option
01:34:27 <gour> can you check spamd.log?
01:35:24 <dcoutts> gour, it might be just that it's being tagged as suspicious rather than definately spam
01:35:32 <dcoutts> in which case it gets moderated
01:37:07 <gour> still, the log should say something
01:40:06 <gour> dcoutts: huh, now it went through :-(
01:40:17 <dcoutts> gour, I just stopped spamd
01:40:26 <gour> ahh
01:41:12 <dcoutts> gour, I've restarted it using debug output
01:41:33 <dcoutts> gour, so I should get some debug output on my console if you post a comment
01:42:06 <gour> ok, i'll try again, where is SA log?
01:43:41 <gour> dcoutts: it went through again
01:44:37 <dcoutts> hmm, odd. smapd is running and listening to the right port
01:44:52 <dcoutts> I wonder if php is caching the old socket connection
01:48:51 <chrisbrown> morning
01:50:02 <roconnor> morning
01:50:55 <Diablo-D3> er.
01:51:20 * Diablo-D3 wonders how big his ghc and darcs installation is
01:51:24 <gour> dcoutts: have you found out something?
01:52:19 <dcoutts> gour, sadly, no
01:53:11 <dcoutts> gour, I can switch it back to running from /etc/init.d rather than me running it manually.
01:53:23 <dcoutts> but I can't see any difference it'd make
01:54:31 <gour> dcoutts: hey, it looks is didn't went through but was held for mod.
01:55:14 <gour> dcoutts: let me leave it for a while, and i'll come back 
01:55:25 <dcoutts> gour, ok
01:56:02 <dcoutts> gour, the email should have an extra headder including the tag: "c72beebe6ecbdddff71b846c4858ebcb"
01:57:03 <gour> dcoutts: ok, will check next time, btw, what is the login for gallery?
02:00:31 <dcoutts> gour, same as for WP
02:01:45 <gour> dcoutts: hmm, i wanted to check whether php is compiled properly
02:08:28 <gour> dcoutts: it is ok (with php), i'll look for some other solution or browse wp forums a bit..
02:09:16 <dcoutts> gour, I'm not sure what you're talking about
02:09:57 <gour> dcoutts: i'll look for some other plugin or if there is some (known) problem with this one
02:10:07 <dcoutts> ok
02:16:27 <takuan> what good are IArrays as opposed to normal arrays?
02:16:47 <sylvan> IArrays *are* normal arrays
02:16:58 <takuan> but?
02:17:01 <sylvan> but nothing
02:17:09 <sylvan> IArray is the type class interface for Array
02:17:16 <takuan> aha
02:17:24 <takuan> and why would one want to use it?
02:17:32 <sylvan> Array?
02:17:39 <takuan> the type class?
02:17:47 <sylvan> Because you can then swap out the imiplementation
02:17:54 <takuan> ah
02:17:56 <takuan> ok
02:17:56 <sylvan> DiffArray uses the IArray interface as well
02:18:00 <takuan> i got the picture
02:18:13 <takuan> are there other implementations appart from Diffarray and Array?
02:18:21 <sylvan> Not immutable, AFAIK
02:18:36 <sylvan> Then there's the MArray interface for mutable array of which there are plenty
02:18:50 <takuan> what's the difference between mutable and immutable?
02:18:57 <Diablo-D3> changeable and not
02:19:15 <sylvan> A mutable array can be updated, whereas an immutable can't (you create a new copy of the array each time you update something)
02:19:24 <takuan> aha
02:19:33 <dcoutts> mutable is update in place
02:19:43 <ProfTeggy> Morning.
02:19:52 <sylvan> DiffArray is an interesting compromise. It has an immutable interface, but is implemented in terms of a mutable Array.. So it's still O(1) updates
02:22:39 <dcoutts> sylvan, if you use it linearly
02:22:47 <sylvan> yes, of course
02:23:15 <dcoutts> and unforunatley it's not got very good constant factors
02:24:37 <sylvan> I keep hearing that, but I haven't meassured it myself.. It would be interesting to see various algorithms implemnted with DiffArrays, Arrays, and then with runST and STArrays...
02:24:52 <sylvan> Like graph algorithms etc.
02:26:04 * boegel misses HWN :(
02:26:31 <dcoutts> sylvan, that would be interesting
02:27:16 <Saulzar> How are they implemented? An array of history lists?
02:28:22 <sylvan> Saulzar: I think it updates the mutable array and then silently update previous "handles" to the elements to hold the changes
02:36:49 <dcoutts> Saulzar, I think it is a list of the history at each element in the array
02:37:06 <dcoutts> so accessing the current value is O(1)
02:37:22 <dcoutts> and it's linear to access older entries
02:47:21 <Lemmih> dcoutts: Do you accept darcs patches for gtk2hs?
02:48:58 <dcoutts> Lemmih, usually yes, but our darcs mirror is down at the moment
02:49:11 <dcoutts> Lemmih, we're actually moveing fully to darcs soonish.
02:49:36 <dcoutts> Lemmih, but do feel free to send us any kind of patch, traditional or darcs
02:50:32 <dcoutts> the current gtk2hs darcs mirror probably is ok, it's just a week or two out of date. But there haven't been that many changes recently.
02:51:10 <Lemmih> I've binded gtk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func.
02:52:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, ah, that's an interesting one. We're actualyl right in the middle of redsigning the treeview bindings. You might not need that function when we're done.
02:52:25 <dcoutts> Lemmih, what do you need it for?
02:53:24 <Lemmih> I need to change the foreground of some elements in a ListView.
02:53:37 <dcoutts> we're making it possible to implement models in Haskell so it'll be much easier to have the model rows to be a custom Haskell data type with conversion functions to return the columns as the limited range of types that the view can accept
02:54:13 <dcoutts> Lemmih, and you're doing that based on a calculated property of the row data?
02:54:17 <Lemmih> Will this happen anytime soon?
02:54:43 <dcoutts> Lemmih, the low level bits are already in cvs. I posted the high level bits to the devel list yesterday.
02:54:47 <JohnMeacham> Ah. fill in the boxes independently, and then unify. that makes more sense.
02:55:34 <dcoutts> Lemmih, currently the high level bits only implement immutable stores. that's the main bit left to do
02:56:20 <dcoutts> Lemmih, it profides an interface like this: makeListStore :: [Column a] -> [a] -> IO TreeModel
02:56:29 <dcoutts> where:
02:56:31 <dcoutts> data Column a = ColumnString (a -> String)
02:56:31 <dcoutts>               | ColumnInt    (a -> Int)
02:56:31 <dcoutts>               | ColumnBool   (a -> Bool)
02:56:33 <dcoutts> etc
02:57:03 <dcoutts> so it's not difficult to provide extra columns that are calculated from your row data
02:57:09 <Lemmih> Looks nice.
02:57:49 <dcoutts> and theres a similar one for trees: makeTreeStore :: [Column a] -> [Tree a] -> IO TreeModel
02:58:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, there's just no way to modify the models after construction. Yet.
02:58:31 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so would that solve your problem?
02:58:57 <Lemmih> I don't see how it would.
03:00:11 <dcoutts> you're setting an attribute of a renderer from column in the model by providing a function that calculates the value of the attribute (since it's not otherwise of the right type)
03:00:43 <dcoutts> instead you could just add an extra column to your model that is the right value for the renderer attribute
03:00:58 <dcoutts> and the newer way of making models would make that easy
03:02:15 <dcoutts> Lemmih, make sense?
03:02:48 <Lemmih> I still don't get it. I'm setting renderer attributes for specific cells, btw.
03:03:10 <dcoutts> Lemmih, right but you're doing that based on data in the model.
03:03:51 <dcoutts> Lemmih, so for some cells it's the ordinary colour, for others is a different colour, depending on the data in that row of the model
03:04:02 <Lemmih> Yeah.
03:04:22 <dcoutts> what is the type of the column that you calculate it on?
03:04:32 <Lemmih> GVstring.
03:04:56 <Lemmih> Whether or not the data should change color changes over time.
03:05:04 <dcoutts> eg: if beginsWithUpperCase str then red else black
03:06:15 <Lemmih> I still don't get it (:
03:06:53 <dcoutts> so instead of having a conversion function in the view (String -> Colour)
03:07:05 <dcoutts> you add that calculated column to the model itself
03:07:31 <Lemmih> *(String -> IO Color)
03:07:34 <dcoutts> ColumnColour (\row -> if ... then ... else ...)
03:08:14 <dcoutts> well bear in mind that you can't just change the value without telling the view that something's changed
03:08:20 <dcoutts> otherwise it will not know to update
03:08:30 <Lemmih> I know that.
03:08:49 <dcoutts> right, so you'd actually have to update the store to get it to change
03:09:32 <Lemmih> Yeah, that's OK. That's what I want.
03:10:13 <dcoutts> then I think that making it easy to add calculated columns to the model is the same as the patch you're adding
03:11:38 <dcoutts> do you see any problem?
03:13:05 <Lemmih> I still don't get what you're talking about...
03:13:26 <Lemmih> Anyhow, I'll just distribute the function my own program and be done with it (:
03:15:25 <dcoutts> Lemmih, I guess it'll be clearer when we've got more example code out. So yeah, just use the thing you've got now until the new treeview api comes out.
03:17:16 <dcoutts> Lemmih, if you like you can send a concrete example to the gtk2hs-devel list and we can see how it might be done with the new api. Actually that'd be useful for us too, just to check our ideas against reality. :-)
03:39:07 <Diablo-D3> hey if anyone cares
03:39:12 <Diablo-D3> I have darcs on the shell server now
03:39:27 <Lemmih> hurrah
03:40:23 <Diablo-D3> /home/users/d/di/diablo-d3/bin/darcs
03:40:50 <Diablo-D3> so anyone can use it if they want
03:42:08 <Diablo-D3> I wonder if I'm the first person to put darcs on sf.net
03:44:46 <gour> Diablo-D3: is it accorfing the the sf rules?
03:44:59 <Diablo-D3> gour: its not violating the rules afail
03:45:12 <gour> Diablo-D3: hmm, i'm not sure..
03:45:16 <Diablo-D3> atleast, a) we're allowed to compile our own binaries
03:45:26 <Diablo-D3> b) we're allowed to execute them on the shell servers
03:45:36 <gour> Diablo-D3: i had darcs there but...
03:45:49 <Diablo-D3> c) as long as we don't use lots of cpu time and memory and bandwidth...
03:46:04 <Diablo-D3> d) and we dont exceed the 100 megs allocated per project
03:46:06 <Diablo-D3> we're fine.
03:47:00 <Diablo-D3> so, if sf.net wants to ban darcs usage, they'll have to make a rule specifically forbidding it.
04:06:13 <Diablo-D3> if anyone cares, I moved the darcs binary
04:06:19 <Diablo-D3> /home/users/d/di/diablo-d3/bin/real-darcs
04:06:36 * Diablo-D3 is going to use a script that calls darcs instead to stand in the place of darcs
04:11:00 <jlouis> ADEpt: I put in some more documentation stuff yesterday when I had the time to work on it (conjure)
04:27:31 <mysteriousentity> Is says in the GHC docs that foldl' is a strict version of foldl. What does that mean?
04:31:21 <mysteriousentity> (Is = It)
04:32:26 <wilx> That it folds the whole list even when the result is not needed?
04:32:27 <eivuokko> Strict means it's evaluates strictly, that is immediately.
04:34:07 <eivuokko> Nah, if result is not used, it won't be evaluated, but if any part of result is used (first item of the list) the whole list is populated.
04:34:29 <eivuokko> (Probably, I haven't used foldl' myself)
04:34:55 <mysteriousentity> Thanks. Could come in useful I suppose.
04:35:56 <eivuokko> Mmmm.
04:38:16 <roconnor> that sounds backwards.
04:39:05 <eivuokko> Which does?
04:40:15 <roconnor> You said if any part of the result is used the whole list is populated, but foldl consumes lists, not produces lists.
04:40:41 <eivuokko> Yeah, sorry, my mistake
04:42:14 <eivuokko> I was thinking foldl' used to implement list->list transformations.
04:42:33 <roconnor> oh
04:42:52 <eivuokko> Which, to me, seems most logical use for strict folding, but of course it isn't precise.
04:42:58 <roconnor> sure
04:51:21 <gour> dcoutts: ping
04:51:54 <dcoutts> gour, pong
04:52:35 <gour> dcoutts: what do you think about http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/ ?
04:53:09 <gour> dcoutts: in wp forums i found a post explaining that sa-plugin sends everything to the queue
04:53:28 <dcoutts> gour, oh. Hmm that's not ideal.
04:55:22 <gour> dcoutts: i believe most spammers do not manually write comments
04:55:40 <dcoutts> gour, indeed, it's automated
04:57:41 <gour> dcoutts: so what do you think about the tool?
04:58:28 <dcoutts> gour, I'm not so sure. There's the danger that it can cut people off from the site, even if they do not post comments.
05:04:16 <gour> dcoutts: yup, another alternative is http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/
05:04:22 <takuan> can you put negative values on the command line?
05:04:26 <gour> dcoutts: with the following disclaimer:
05:04:50 <gour> mySQL: it is highly discouraged to run SK2 with any version of mySQL below 4.0 (recent mySQL versions are in the 5.x). 
05:05:04 <gour> SK2 has been reported to work somewhat OK with mySQL 3.x, except for a few oddities in the admin section, but you are on your own if you decide to ignore that requirement.
05:05:14 <gour> dcoutts: so what shall we do?
05:05:18 <kzm> takuan: command line?  ghci?
05:05:36 <kzm> > [negate 10..0]
05:05:37 <lambdabot> [-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0]
05:05:56 <kzm> @type -5
05:05:57 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => a
05:06:14 <kzm> @type -
05:06:15 <lambdabot> parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
05:06:19 <kzm> @type (-)
05:06:20 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
05:06:33 <kzm> > [-10..0]
05:06:34 <lambdabot> [-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0]
05:07:09 <dcoutts> gour, so haskell.org has mtsql 3.23.58
05:07:42 <dcoutts> it's a pretty recent version of the 3.x series, so perhaps it'd work
05:09:40 <gour> dcoutts: so let's bet with it
05:09:50 <dcoutts> gour, ok
05:10:08 * dcoutts deactivates the previous spam plugin
05:14:03 <takuan> kzm: i'm wrong
05:15:53 <takuan> how do you convert a string gotten with getline into a Int or Double?
05:15:58 <Saulzar> Hmm, I'm having some difficulty compiling gtk2hs - it has errors on these kind of macros " #if PANGO_CHECK_VERSION(1,6,0) "
05:19:54 <gour> dcoutts: i installed sk2 and left default values, pls. browse a bit through them, id' have to do some of my studies for today :-)
05:21:39 <gour> dcoutts: i'll try to test with some spam from my local folder
05:21:49 <dcoutts> gour, ok cool
05:22:55 <gour> dcoutts: huh, i goes through
05:23:43 <dcoutts> gour, check the log
05:24:06 <gour> dcoutts: i cannot, i'm busy with more spamming
05:24:15 <dcoutts> gour, hah!
05:25:05 <gour> dcoutts: another hit, maybe i should change my profession
05:25:18 <dcoutts> lol
05:28:29 * dcoutts notes gour's new account "spammer_gour"
05:28:52 <gour> well, i'm preparing for a new job
05:30:27 <gour> dcoutts: can you try with some test. maybe you're more lucky
05:32:39 <gour> dcoutts: here is also another interesting tool http://akismet.com/
05:33:14 * gour is deleting sa-plugin from the plugins' folder
05:38:05 <dcoutts> gour, I've made the SK2 setting a bit stricter.
05:38:48 <gour> dcoutts: fine, can you post some spam, i've already removed all my daily food :-)
05:47:59 <chrisbrown> hi
05:48:28 <chrisbrown> does anyone know the main difference between a newtype and a data declaration?
05:48:58 <ulfdoz> chrisbrown: newtype is an alias for another type, while data declares a new data type.
05:49:21 <ulfdoz> At least in my opinion, newtype is a misnomer.
05:49:33 <chrisbrown> hmmm
05:49:34 <gour> dcoutts: have you seen axel's msg? 
05:49:50 <chrisbrown> acording to thompson a newtype is just a data type with one unary constructor
05:50:20 <chrisbrown> it has the same effect as a declaring a data type but it is more officient
05:50:23 <chrisbrown> *effincient
05:50:43 <Lemmih> Yep, that's right.
05:50:44 <eivuokko> Yeah.  It creates distinct type.
05:50:55 <chrisbrown> cool
05:51:27 * chrisbrown thinks of another refactoring to add to HaRe
05:53:19 <gour> soysauce, thompson's def is valid?
05:53:34 <MarcWeber> Hi. I want to make an executable (ihc from hdirect) which depends on the package com. I get a lot of undefined reference messages. Does this mean 've mmissed to specify the libdirectory in the cabal file correctly?
05:53:38 <chrisbrown> i would say its pretty accurate
05:53:46 <chrisbrown> but then i would say that as hes my advisor :)
05:53:46 * gour wonders how soysause went into the channel instead of 'so'
05:54:20 <gour> chrisbrown: i like his book using it for my self-study
05:54:58 <chrisbrown> gour: its good, but there much else to use. Hudack's is good but i dont like how he introduces monads too quickly
05:55:14 <chrisbrown> functional programming by field and harrison os good too, but a little old now
05:55:24 <MarcWeber> The undefined references can be found in the .o files of the com library.. So do I have to add them to ghc myself or should it be sufficient to use -package com?
05:55:42 <gour> chrisbrown: well, i understand that everything is not in the book, however monads are 'future' for me
05:56:10 <chrisbrown> gour: its a good idea to learn the pure paradigm first, before using monads
05:58:02 <gour> chrisbrown: yes, i agree, there will be time for monads later
05:58:47 <gour> chrisbrown: i'm somehow stuck on 14th chapter (due to time-constrains), but let's hope soon i can resume
06:04:27 <hulahub> hey
06:06:52 <Saulzar> Hi
06:15:46 <chrisbrown> gour: what is the 14th chapter?
06:15:51 <chrisbrown> alegbraic types?
06:22:20 <hulahub> i want to create a graph and im unsure how to do it - i thought about the way of a binary tree and did this: data GTree = Node Int [GTree] - but it is not really usable (it is but not very nice...) - is there a better way to realize a graph ?
06:23:07 <chrisbrown> a list of vertices?
06:23:17 <chrisbrown> [(Int, Int)] ?
06:25:42 <danY2K> chrisbrown, arrays are another way to do it: http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/arrays.html
06:42:35 <tromp_> check out the Data.Graph library
06:45:51 <JaffaCake> afternoon, #haskell
06:46:20 <JaffaCake> only 175 today, we're slacking
06:47:46 <dcoutts> hia JaffaCake 
06:47:53 <chrisbrown> hi
06:47:55 <JaffaCake> hi there
06:48:40 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, there seems to be some concensus over the shipment idea, ie not to have too much of a shipment concept
06:49:08 <JaffaCake> dcoutts: yes, I'm glad we didn't rush in and implement something
06:49:13 * dcoutts too
06:49:43 <musasabi> JaffaCake: hello, what would be the correct place to send patches to the libraries thing? (and are darcs patches fine or do you want the output of diff?)
06:50:03 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, oh, I was wondering if it'd be possible to host the new Gtk2Hs darcs repo on cvs.haskell.org, and if so wondering if Axel and I could get accounts (we've already got haskell.org accounts)
06:50:07 <JaffaCake> musasabi: cvs-ghc@haskell.org or me directly, and darcs patches are fine thanks!
06:50:20 <musasabi> ok
06:50:32 <JaffaCake> dcoutts: sure, send me SSH keys and usernames
06:50:43 <JaffaCake> don't you have an account already?  thought I remember setting one up for you
06:50:48 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, ok, will do. Thanks.
06:51:00 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, we've got accounts on haskell.org not cvs.h.o
06:51:13 <JaffaCake> oh, guess not
06:58:41 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, do you want us to send them to you or would it be kosher for you to just: for username in duncan simona gour; do grab ~$username/.ssh/authorized_keys; done
06:58:51 <dcoutts> (on haskell.org that is)
06:59:33 <JaffaCake> ok, that's fine
06:59:38 <dcoutts> ta
06:59:59 <JaffaCake> you just want to use darcs, right?
07:00:04 <dcoutts> yep
07:00:13 <JaffaCake> I'll just put you in the darcs group for now then
07:00:31 <dcoutts> ok, actually gour probably doesn't need darcs access yet
07:00:48 <dcoutts> he needed access on haskell.org because of all the web stuff
07:00:58 <JaffaCake> ok, he doesn't need an account?
07:01:12 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, I don't think so
07:08:05 <JaffaCake> dcoutts: ok, can you try logging into cvs.haskell.org?
07:08:32 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, it works. Thanks v. much.
07:08:39 <JaffaCake> great
07:08:58 <dcoutts> I'll have to lookup how to get darcs to email all changes to our commit list
07:09:17 <JaffaCake> yes
07:09:19 <dcoutts> it's got darcs 1.0.4 I see, which is good.
07:09:37 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, so where on the filesystem do the repos live?
07:09:45 <JaffaCake> should probably upgrade to 1.0.5
07:10:02 <JaffaCake> dcoutts: /home/dardcs
07:10:06 <JaffaCake> oops /home/darcs
07:10:14 <dcoutts> ah yes I see them
07:10:45 <JaffaCake> we now have darcs.haskell.org set up, with /home/darcs as the root
07:10:59 <JaffaCake> so you can just say 'darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/ghc' for example
07:11:15 <jethr0_> what do i have to import to get "ParsecExpr"?
07:11:46 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, a I see cvs.haskell.org and darcs.haskell.org are aliases for the same machine at galois
07:12:12 <JaffaCake> yes, but their contents aren't the same (see the Apache setup)
07:12:26 <dcoutts> right, virtual hosting stuff. Nice.
07:12:42 <JaffaCake> also, hackage.haskell.org and haskell.galois.com are all the same machine :)
07:13:20 <Sine2UNI> could anyone help me out with a simple function? position :: Char -> [Char] -> Int : i.e. *position 'e' haskell* should return 5, and *position 'x' "haskell"* should return the length of the string...
07:13:29 <CosmicRay> hey JaffaCake 
07:13:39 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: hi there, how goes it?
07:13:48 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: see the cc option to darcs apply plus the darcs prefs mechanism
07:13:51 <CosmicRay> pretty good
07:14:10 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: just wanted to explore the "where to from here" questions
07:14:13 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, ok I'll look into it. Thanks.
07:14:21 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: good idea
07:14:35 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: that will work if you are always darcs pushing into that repo, and never darcs recording directly.
07:14:36 <Lemmih> > elemIndex 'e' "haskell"
07:14:38 <lambdabot> Just 4
07:14:55 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: do you have some criteria you want to meet before switching over to darcs?
07:15:05 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, yeah, we'll always darcs push from our home machines and not work on the server directly.
07:15:08 <Sine2UNI> Lemmih: we have to do it recursivly :(
07:15:22 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: I just want to make sure it's not going to make anyone's life hell, that's the main criteria
07:15:44 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: well that does make sense ;-)
07:15:45 <jethr0_> sine2ui, this wouldn't be homework would it ;-)
07:15:53 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: have you heard any comments from other core ghc hackers?
07:16:00 <Sine2UNI> jethr0_: of course it is, lol
07:16:12 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: btw you may want to rm -r ~darcs/ghc.partial
07:16:20 <JaffaCake> not really, but then most of the other developers only commit very occasionally
07:16:21 <Sine2UNI> but i'm trying to understand haskell recursive functions  and having a bit of troble with it :\
07:16:54 <Cale> Sine2UNI: well, Haskell recursive functions aren't terribly different from recursive functions anywhere else :)
07:17:01 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: regarding ghc.partial, I put that there as an experiment for browsing with Trac, because Trac had trouble with the full repo
07:17:09 <CosmicRay> ah
07:17:19 <jethr0_> sine2ui, "let pos n _ [] s = length s; pos n elt (x:xs) s = if x ==elt then n else pos (n+1) elt xs s" or something like that.
07:17:24 <JaffaCake> but it turns out that Trac can't browse the partial repo
07:17:32 <jethr0_> although writing elemIndex by hand and using it would be nicer
07:17:40 <Cale> Just the same as usual, you solve large problems by breaking them down in terms of smaller ones.
07:17:45 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: is there a web interface to the cvs repo installed on that box?
07:18:09 <Lemmih> jethr0_: It's simpler than that.
07:18:14 <jethr0_> \elt str -> maybe (length str) id (elemIndex elt str)
07:18:16 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay:  http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/
07:18:21 <CosmicRay> ah
07:18:41 <jlouis> Sine2UNI: in fact, the difference could be that recursive functions tail-calls 
07:18:42 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: the problem seems to be the performance of 'darcs changes F' for some file F
07:18:43 <jethr0_> right, "let pos n _ [] = n"
07:18:47 <Cale> In the case of lists, the most natural way is to break the problem down by solving it for the empty list, and then for a list with one (or sometimes more) elements added to the start of it.
07:19:04 <JaffaCake> the repo browser does it for every file in a dir, I think, and it takes like 30 secs for each one
07:19:08 <Lemmih> jethr0_: It's even simpler than that. (:
07:19:14 <jethr0_> do tell
07:19:20 <dcoutts> CosmicRay, does darcs optimise help with that or the need to use --partial?
07:19:23 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: have you looked at darcs-cgi?
07:19:49 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: well I believe the problem here is that trac is designed to operate in a svn world
07:19:49 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: yes darcs-cgi is quicker, because it doesn't do 'darcs changes' until you click on the 'patches' link for any file
07:19:52 <CosmicRay> darcs is very different
07:19:59 <Lemmih> jethr0_: let pos _ [] = 1; pos e (x:xs) | e == x = 1 | otherwise = 1 + pos e xs
07:20:21 <jethr0_> true
07:20:39 <JaffaCake> It seems to me that it should be possible for darcs to cache enough information to be able to perform 'darcs changes' much more quickly
07:20:40 <jethr0_> i always tend to overcomplicate
07:20:59 <CosmicRay> there is also darcsweb
07:21:00 <Sine2UNI> so what does the underscore do?
07:21:03 <CosmicRay> http://www.abridgegame.org/pipermail/darcs-users/2005-June/007920.html
07:21:21 <jlouis> Sine2UNI: the underscore is a wildcard. Stands for ``anything, but no name given''
07:21:25 <jethr0_> lemmih, shouldn't it be zero though? pos 'x' "" -> 0
07:21:44 <Sine2UNI> oh ok
07:21:51 <Lemmih> jethr0_: Oh, right.
07:21:58 <jethr0_> i guess the semantics of this function aren't that great anyways
07:22:14 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: 'darcs changes' itself is pretty fast.
07:22:19 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: 'darcs changes -s' is slower.
07:22:39 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: but when you add a file, it really slows down because presumably it has to search all the patches
07:22:41 <jethr0_> lemmih, thx for correcting my hideous version
07:22:50 <Sine2UNI> ERROR "temp.hs":21 - Syntax error in input (unexpected keyword "let")
07:22:59 <Sine2UNI> ERROR "temp.hs":21 - Haskell 98 does not support anonymous type variables
07:23:00 <Sine2UNI> hehe
07:23:07 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I'm confused; "darcs add" is slow, or "darcs changes" is slow, or the web interface is slow"
07:23:23 <xerox> "
07:23:34 <Igloo> "darcs changes foo" is slow, which makes interfaces slow
07:23:37 <jethr0_> sine2ui, you need to use "let fun ... in fun 'x' "haskell""
07:23:41 <CosmicRay> ah.
07:23:42 <JaffaCake> the web interface is slow, because it uses "darcs changes F" and "darcs changes F" is slow
07:23:47 <jethr0_> or define the function in the file without let
07:24:06 <Igloo> And yeah, like Simon says, it's just no-one's written a cache of what is in what patch file
07:24:07 <Sine2UNI> fetch :: Int -> [Char] -> Char
07:24:07 <Sine2UNI> fetch n (x:xs)
07:24:07 <Sine2UNI> 	| n == 0 = x
07:24:07 <Sine2UNI> 	| otherwise = fetch (n-1) (xs)
07:24:11 <Sine2UNI> my fetch function is like that
07:24:17 <JaffaCake> Igloo: what are the chances of speeding it up?
07:24:18 <Sine2UNI> and that worked when i loaded it up
07:24:26 <CosmicRay> I think that the correct thing for a web interface to do is to not request the history unless it's specifically needed
07:24:34 <CosmicRay> I think that both darcsweb and darcs.cgi are good about that.
07:24:41 <JaffaCake> Igloo: never mind, I just saw your last comment
07:24:54 <jethr0_> yes, that's alright, although the "n==0" irritates me
07:25:05 <CosmicRay> darcsweb looks really cool to me.
07:25:16 <jethr0_> and it might be missing an equal sign after "(x:xs)"
07:25:47 <jethr0> although i'm not sure about that
07:26:21 <Lemmih> Sine2UNI: You can write that as: 'fetch 0 (x:xs) = x'
07:26:43 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: it would be great to get the Trac browser working, because you can refer to changesets using the wiki - it's harder to do that with an external browser
07:27:06 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: are you planning to install trac for ghc overall?
07:27:08 <JaffaCake> eg. pointing to a changeset from a ticket when you close it
07:27:35 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: not sure what you mean - it is installed for ghc?
07:27:43 <jethr0> what do i have to import to get "ParsecExpr"?
07:27:55 <CosmicRay> well, you're using sf.net now, and there's hawiki... are you planning to switch to trac?
07:28:11 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I'm just suggesting that you shouldn't make trac a prerequisite for switching to darcs.
07:28:18 <flux__> btw, I wonder how many haskell functions there are around that enter infinite recursion when given a negative value.. ;)
07:28:26 <CosmicRay> since "not working with trac" doesn't represent a regression from the current state
07:28:41 <JaffaCake> oh sure, it's not a blocking issue
07:28:46 <JaffaCake> sorry if I implied that
07:28:53 <CosmicRay> oh ok
07:29:08 <JaffaCake> we're moving away from sf.net
07:29:10 <Lemmih> flux__: Ever found such a function?
07:29:16 <CosmicRay> I forget who the trac hackers are, but some of them may be able to help
07:29:17 <Sine2UNI> well that's how we learned how to do it...
07:29:19 <Sine2UNI> noobs ye know :P
07:29:21 <Cale> flux__: I agree that we seem to need a Natural type anyway
07:30:10 <flux__> lemmih, well, I haven't looked, but it seems common to think value 0 is the base case (and handled with pattern matching) while inductive steps recurse into n - 1
07:30:22 <flux__> I may have done that ;)
07:30:44 <Lemmih> Oh, we aren't talking about the standard libraries here.
07:30:55 <flux__> no, other code
07:31:02 <flux__> I wouldn't expect standard libraries to have such bugs
07:31:07 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: you're planning to switch to trac, or no definite plans yet, or...?
07:31:13 <MarcWeber> Compiling using C-files (ghc -C option) and using an own package, how are the libraries to comile against added? Manually or is the package system able to do that ?
07:31:17 <flux__> too bad positive numbers are difficult/impossible to type in the presence of substraction
07:31:20 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: yes, we have already switched to trac :)
07:31:25 <flux__> (without runtime errors)
07:31:31 <JaffaCake> all the bugs have been migrated
07:31:47 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: oh, wow.  did I miss an announcement somewhere?
07:32:19 <CosmicRay> huh.  I see the links on haskell.org/ghc have ben updated.
07:32:20 <CosmicRay> sweet!
07:32:27 <JaffaCake> maybe.. http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2005-December/009392.html
07:32:27 <CosmicRay> I have this large distaste for sf.net anyway.
07:32:29 <flux__> hmm.. there could be nats that have values 0.. and then nats that are 1.., and the latter ones could be converted into the former by substracting one
07:32:41 <flux__> that would allow most cases of recursion work ;)
07:33:07 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: this has been my main amusement for the week... I had to hack around with the scripts that came with trac for migrating the sf.net metadata
07:33:07 <flux__> I imagine you can do that now if you spell out the natural numbers with S(S(S(.. notation
07:33:12 <jethr0> flux__, but how do you handle "0 - 1"? throw an exception?
07:33:27 <Lemmih> > [] !! (-1) :: Int
07:33:28 <lambdabot> Exception: Prelude.(!!): negative index
07:33:34 <jethr0> ok
07:33:37 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: so anyway, I've got no problem with maintaining the cvs->darcs gateway indefinately...
07:33:38 <flux__> dunno
07:33:42 <flux__> propably the only way
07:33:54 <CosmicRay> but I know of at least one person that already has darcs patches to submit ;-)
07:33:59 <flux__> sometimes you know statically if a value is 0 or not, though
07:34:01 <JaffaCake> heh
07:34:04 <flux__> (or could know)
07:34:27 <CosmicRay> so if there's anything else I can do to help make the decision to flip the switch easier, please do let me know
07:34:35 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay:thanks
07:34:50 <JaffaCake> what's the status of the email commit messages?
07:35:02 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: It will take me 15 minutes to turn them on when you give the word.
07:35:18 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: you probably don't want them on now, since then you'll get duplicate emails for each commit.  (one from cvs, one from darcs.)
07:35:30 <JaffaCake> true
07:35:40 <JaffaCake> how often is the resync run at the mo?
07:35:46 <CosmicRay> about once a day
07:35:55 <CosmicRay> I've been too lazy to cron it.
07:36:02 <JaffaCake> ok, no problem
07:36:22 <JaffaCake> right, I'll send something to the developers and see if we can establish a cut off point
07:36:48 <JaffaCake> do you know if it'll be possible to reverse the direction of the sync.. or is that a lot of work?
07:37:13 <CosmicRay> it appears to be possible, but rather difficult
07:37:22 <JaffaCake> right
07:37:27 <CosmicRay> I don't think I have the expertise to do it
07:38:10 <CosmicRay> but really, I think it should be very easy for people to make the switch to darcs.
07:38:31 <CosmicRay> they really need to know only four commands (get, push, pull, record)
07:38:38 <dcoutts> going darcs -> cvs is harder because cvs is more restrictive than darcs, especially about the ordering of patches
07:38:50 <JaffaCake> I think so too, but I think our biggest group of users are those who just grab the sources from anoncvs and build it
07:39:08 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, and that's even easier now
07:39:26 <CosmicRay> I would suspect that a darcs get --partial would be faster than a cvs co.
07:39:27 <JaffaCake> well sure, but they all have to do something
07:39:28 <CosmicRay> also easier.
07:39:41 <JaffaCake> as opposed to nothing :)
07:39:43 <dcoutts> I always used to have problems with ghc's cvs setup, I often had problems with the update becuase of dirs getting added
07:39:48 <SamB> who would go darcs -> cvs?
07:39:54 <SamB> does it build from darcs, then?
07:40:26 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: I just remembered... I should probalby set up the nightly builds to use darcs
07:40:36 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: that would be nice.
07:40:39 <dcoutts> SamB, yep. I did built it the other day.
07:40:49 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: I imagine there will be some tweaks somewhere due to the new layout of the tree?
07:40:56 <JaffaCake> CosmicRay: can you set up a cron job to do the resync, so I'm getting the latest sources for the nightly builds
07:41:25 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: also there should be a script in whatever the top level becomes, that people can run to darcs get/darcs pull all the sub-repos.
07:41:27 <JaffaCake> our builds always grab the sources at around 1800 GMT
07:41:30 <CosmicRay> sure I can do that
07:41:53 <JaffaCake> great
07:42:00 <CosmicRay> so that looks like 1000 local time on that box
07:42:11 <JaffaCake> sounds about right
07:42:13 <CosmicRay> so I'll cron it to run at 0800 local time then perhaps
07:42:21 <CosmicRay> that's in about 20 minutes so we should see if it works well
07:42:46 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: would you like a CC on the output of the daily sync job?
07:43:03 <JaffaCake> yes, for a while anyway
07:43:08 <JaffaCake> thanks
07:43:17 <CosmicRay> does your account on that box forward to the right place?
07:43:23 <JaffaCake> should do
07:43:27 <CosmicRay> ok
07:44:22 <CosmicRay> ok.  cron job set up.
07:45:36 <CosmicRay> you should get a mail in about 15 mins.
07:45:46 <JaffaCake> ta
07:50:59 <MarcWeber> Can you see my messages?
07:51:02 <shapr> no
07:51:03 <shapr> oops
07:51:28 <shapr> I have the urge to disorganize another edition of the IOHCC.
07:51:45 <shapr> MarcWeber: We are receiving you.
07:52:33 <MarcWeber> shapr: Thanks.. Then nobody seems to be familiar with cabal, package installation and compiling using c files.. ;-(
07:53:14 <shapr> I'm sure someone is familiar with it... but the intersection of familiar, awake, and has time may not be satisfied.
07:53:14 <JaffaCake> dcoutts: what's your canonical email addr?  <duncan.coutts@worc.ox.ac.uk>?  (for the records on cvs.haskell.org)
07:53:40 <shapr> MarcWeber: I know that HSQL was cabalized recently, can you borrow tricks from that cabal file?
07:54:18 <dcoutts> JaffaCake, yes
07:55:13 <MarcWeber> When writing your own library e.g. Test.hs and create your Setup.hs file and so on runhaskell Setup.hs build install will register it and compile it. It will also create library files into dist/build subdir. 
07:55:14 <shapr> Has the Shannon-Hartley theorem been applied to anonymity?
07:56:31 <MarcWeber> When compilng my test application ghc -C -o main.c ; ghc main.c I get undefined references unless adding the library files explicit. Is there another way? I've read about library-dirs and extra-lib-dirs options but couldn't make them work.
07:56:49 <gour_> CosmicRay: hi, is offlineimap your app?
07:57:02 <CosmicRay> gour: yes
07:57:32 <gour_> CosmicRay: great, it looks it is the one i need, may i ask something, i'm pretty new with imap?
07:57:38 <CosmicRay> sure
07:57:41 <Lemmih> MarcWeber: You have to link with the library.
07:57:56 <CosmicRay> gour: though I have the right to LART you if the phrase "microsoft exchange" appears anywhere in this query ;-)
07:58:11 <MarcWeber> Lemmih: Sure. But do I have to add the library by myself or should the ghc option -package test be sufficient?
07:58:20 <gour_> CosmicRay: i have accounts on 2 server, one has courier-imap, the other pop3
07:58:32 <gour_> CosmicRay: don't worry about m$ :-)
07:58:40 <Lemmih> MarcWeber: '-package pkg' or '--make' should suffice.
07:59:07 <CosmicRay> ms exchange and uw imapd make up about 80% of the complaints I have about offlineimap due to their broken imap implementations
07:59:17 <CosmicRay> gour: ok, go ahead...
07:59:50 <gour_> CosmicRay: on imap server, one account is for all the mailing lists i'm subscribed and i do not want to waste server (friend's) space with it, but just retrieve email and keep it locally
08:00:17 <gour_> CosmicRay: i assume that for this account it's best to retrieve (as now) via pop3?
08:00:28 <CosmicRay> yes, or you could use something such as fetchmail with imap
08:00:50 <CosmicRay> offlineimap doesn't have a download-and-delete mode.  its only mode is synchronization.  (just like fetchmail's only mode is download/delete)
08:00:57 <gour_> CosmicRay: atm, i use getmail with filters for clamav, sa & maildrop for sorting
08:01:22 <gour_> CosmicRay: but i plan to switch from mutt to evolution..
08:02:23 <gour_> CosmicRay: otoh, i'd like to have my desktop email in sync with the laptop, but how to do that 'cause i fetch with one pop3-only server and another which has imap?
08:02:56 <gour_> CosmicRay: should i maybe forward from pop3 --> imap ?
08:03:04 <gour_> CosmicRay: and then sync?
08:03:31 <CosmicRay> it sounds to me like you'd want to put an imap server on the desktop
08:03:40 <CosmicRay> do your pop3 download into that server's area
08:03:46 <CosmicRay> point evolution to the imap server on localhost
08:03:56 <CosmicRay> and install offlineimap on the laptop, pointing it to your desktop's server.
08:04:17 <CosmicRay> since you are not really syncing your desktop to the real mail server, offlineimap is not appropriate there.
08:04:33 <gour_> CosmicRay: let me recap. if i understood properly..
08:04:34 <CosmicRay> normally people use offlineimap directly to sync their desktops, laptops, etc. to the real mail server
08:04:52 <gour_> CosmicRay: but it works only if everything is imap?
08:05:50 <CosmicRay> offlineimap groks imap and maildir only.
08:06:02 <CosmicRay> it is not possible to sync pop3.  the protocol isn't robust enough.
08:06:26 <gour_> CosmicRay: i have qmail running on my desktop, but it is only local
08:07:35 <genneth> hi all; long time
08:08:23 <shapr> hey genneth 
08:08:28 <gour> CosmicRay: but i'd forward from pop3 server to imap server, then it makes sense, i.e. i'd use offlineimap to sync desktop & laptop?
08:08:34 <CosmicRay> gour: right
08:08:53 <CosmicRay> you don't need a smtp server to have an imap server, btw.
08:09:02 <CosmicRay> all an imap server does is serve up a tree of folders.
08:09:07 <CosmicRay> no smtp server needed in your scenario.
08:09:20 <CosmicRay> (well, not for the storage of your mail anyway.  you may need one for outbound mail.)
08:09:25 <gour> CosmicRay: and those mailing-lists account can be fetched as pop3 'cause i do want to have local copy only
08:09:40 <CosmicRay> right
08:09:53 <gour> CosmicRay: yes, no need for smtp, i needed from before when using tmda & need to re-inject mgs etc.
08:10:28 <CosmicRay> JaffaCake: oops, looks like I need to fix PATH in my script...
08:10:30 <genneth> came across an obvious problem yesterday; still haven't worked out how; basically, I want to do hGetLine until I get an empty line, and put all the lines into a list; simple unfoldr... with IO thrown in somehow; I've got the explicit recursion fine, just can't work out how to work the transformers :(
08:12:11 <gour> CosmicRay: so then, i only need to install offline imap to desktop & laptop & sync everything
08:25:58 <elk> does anyone know what this yi error mean?
08:26:00 <elk> yi: user error (loadShared: couldn't load `librt.so' because /usr/lib/librt.so: symbol __librt_multiple_threads, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference)
08:26:52 <CosmicRay> gour: right
08:29:28 <gour> CosmicRay: thanks, do you suggest to stay using getmail for fetching or let evolution do both retrieve/send ?
08:33:38 <dcoutts> @pl \x -> map (f x)
08:33:39 <lambdabot> map . f
08:33:45 <dcoutts> hmm
08:33:57 <dcoutts> @pl \x xs -> map (f x) xs
08:33:57 <lambdabot> map . f
08:34:48 <CosmicRay> gour: I don't really know enough about either to make a good suggestion
08:34:53 <CosmicRay> I seem to be trying to express:
08:34:55 <CosmicRay> type (Show a, Typeable a) => SqlValue a
08:35:00 <CosmicRay> is there a better way...?
08:35:31 <gour> CosmicRay: thank you (for offlineimap too)
08:35:49 <CosmicRay> gour: you're welcome, thanks
08:40:44 <MarcWeber> Lemmih: You were right.. With my lib it's working, but not with hdirect/ihc .. ;-(
09:14:31 <benny> hey guys
09:14:46 <ibid> please help out a stuck teacher and suggest a haskell programming exercise (30 min to two hours, the students have seven weeks' experience in haskell and fp, three or more years general programming experience in a university setting, no monads, basic IO, no typeclasses except the standard classes and deriving)
09:14:52 <ibid> :)
09:14:57 <SamB> hello
09:15:31 <SamB> ibid: lambda calculus interpreter?
09:15:40 <gzl> ibid: some crap with WASH?
09:15:42 <SamB> or is that too easy?
09:15:47 <SamB> or did they do that already?
09:15:48 <gzl> HaXml and XML parsing?
09:15:58 <ibid> SamB: already done, though in a little different setting
09:16:11 <SamB> ibid: different setting?
09:16:15 <SamB> was it in Haskell?
09:16:19 <ibid> i'd rather not make them learn any new libraries for this one
09:16:52 <SamB> was it in Haskell?
09:17:04 * SamB repeats the question until he is answered
09:17:08 <ibid> SamB: we've used extended calculators as cases in lectures and exercises, one of them was basic plusminustimesdivides, the other had also case and let
09:17:27 <ibid> so, not exactly lambda calculus but close enough
09:17:40 <SamB> but with functions?
09:17:47 <ibid> the latter had them
09:18:09 <ibid> ok, not first class but hey :)
09:18:16 <ibid> actually, yeah, i'm going to specify this
09:18:22 <ibid> but i'm looking for another exercise
09:18:52 <ibid> i've usually had a "general programming exercise" in each exercise set, but i've exhausted my own ideas
09:18:57 <xerox> ibid: ask dcoutts for the cairo exercise? :-)
09:19:02 <SamB> general programming?
09:19:26 <ibid> (eg. some graphics stuff like the fractal i've mentioned here earlier, a hangman-style word game etc)
09:19:32 <ibid> xerox: hmm?
09:19:42 <xerox> ibid: the L-Systems, a-la nymphaea.
09:19:58 <ibid> xerox: ah, yeah. something else please :)
09:19:58 <xerox> I think there is a post on http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/ about it.
09:20:01 <xerox> OK :-)
09:20:14 <ibid> xerox: i know. the same post, i think, mentioned my course :)
09:21:07 <SamB> hmm. A word-wrapping tool for paragraphs of text?
09:21:17 <ibid> SamB: general programming in the sense that it's not focusing on the week's topic but on general programming practice
09:21:20 <ibid> done that too
09:21:29 <SamB> oh
09:21:41 <ibid> (this is the seventh exercise set:)
09:21:57 <ibid> (and the last for now, thank $DEITY)
09:22:19 <SamB> you ask for suggestions
09:22:26 <SamB> s/you/you could/
09:22:41 <xerox> ibid: done parsers yet?
09:22:56 <roconnor> I wonder how long it takes to write gzip.
09:23:17 <ibid> xerox: yes
09:23:18 <xerox> Force them to write a cool web-app framework  <whistle>
09:23:25 <SamB> or, you could teach them how to use parsec but *not tell them it involves monads*
09:23:38 <xerox> SamB: I think they're into monads from long time.
09:23:41 <ibid> SamB: done that too
09:23:48 <SamB> oh.
09:23:53 <ibid> (partially in lectures)
09:23:54 <xerox> So...
09:24:00 <robajs> hello
09:24:02 <SamB> you said no monads
09:24:07 <xerox> Howdy, robajs!
09:24:11 * ibid is running out of ideas, as i said :)
09:24:21 <SamB> but didn't mention parsec
09:24:23 <xerox> ..an O.S. ...
09:24:27 <SamB> how about a micro-scheme interpreter?
09:24:37 <SamB> with a purely functional subset of scheme?
09:24:41 <xerox> Interpreters, hmpf..
09:24:55 <xerox> A game?
09:24:59 <SamB> nope?
09:25:04 <ibid> SamB: i've avoided bringing up the concept of monads, but i've used it in special cases a few times (without telling them they're monads), specifically in parsing and one time in the evaluator
09:25:26 <xerox> Implement Go :-)
09:25:27 <Saulzar> raytracer :)
09:25:31 <ibid> xerox: i've done at least one game already (hangman/wheel of fortune style). good ideas? :)
09:25:37 <SamB> raytracers are hard...
09:25:49 <xerox> Go!
09:25:55 <SamB> I mean, one thing wrong and its totally messed up...
09:26:07 <xerox> And then let them fight each others' AIs.
09:26:15 <SamB> Saulzar: you played with darcs yet?
09:26:35 <Saulzar> True, probably requires too much correct "library"
09:26:35 <ibid> (i'm going to talk a lot about monads and hopefully also arrows in the followup course after the holidays)
09:26:45 <xerox> Hmmm.
09:26:58 <SamB> Saulzar: I suppose if they were provided with a library it might be reasonable
09:27:00 <Saulzar> SamB, Other than installing, not really :)
09:27:10 <SamB> Saulzar: play
09:27:22 <SamB> what is your favorite feature request for lambdabot?
09:27:40 <xerox> ibid: write an higher-level DSL upon cairo to play with shapes, aaaaand... invent something with it? :-)
09:27:40 <ibid> xerox: more good ideas? :)
09:27:57 <ibid> too much work for me, i'm already late in publishing this set :)
09:28:00 <xerox> Music?
09:28:09 <ibid> (had a court day that wrecked my schedule)
09:28:09 <SamB> ibid: make them implement Self
09:28:15 <ibid> thee!
09:28:17 <SamB> and then send me their implementations
09:28:18 <xerox> Make GHC sing something.
09:28:33 <xerox> There's something for MIDI, isn't there?
09:28:52 <SamB> Haskore has some midi support
09:28:53 <ibid> sure there is. i am avoiding introducing new libraries at this time, though
09:29:00 <xerox> OK...
09:29:13 <SamB> ibid: all new libraries, or just real libraries?
09:29:14 <xerox> What libraries can we use?
09:29:21 <ibid> this should be more in the line of recap
09:29:33 <SamB> you could steal Saulzar's vector and matrix libraries and make them do a raytracer ;-)
09:29:34 <ibid> SamB: "new" in the sense not covered in the course
09:29:44 <xerox> Yes, what are the "old" ones? :-)
09:29:44 <ibid> xerox: the standard hierarchical libraries
09:29:50 <xerox> I see.
09:29:57 <ibid> and jyuhgraphics
09:29:59 <ibid> -h
09:30:03 <SamB> ibid: all of them?
09:30:10 <xerox> What about modelling a perfect-gas in some container, a-la Self.
09:30:17 <ibid> SamB: that's an ominous question :)
09:30:37 <ibid> SamB: what did you have in mind?
09:30:43 <ibid> (not the graphics ones, no)
09:30:43 <dcoutts> ibid, set last year's ICFP task. :-)
09:30:51 <xerox> haha.
09:30:52 <SamB> Oh. Nothing.
09:30:56 <ibid> dcoutts: can it be done under two hours?
09:31:05 <Saulzar> Naughts and crosses solver 
09:31:05 <ibid> by students, i mean
09:31:08 <SamB> especially since you already said they *don't* know monads
09:31:16 <ibid> not in the general sense
09:31:24 <ibid> they do have the ability to use IO
09:31:28 <xerox> Some kind of algebraic manipulation, useful to some purpose?
09:31:28 <dcoutts> ibid, on the course I help out with they do it in java and it takes them several weeks. So I guess not.
09:31:33 <SamB> well, presumably they aren't familiar with Control.Monad.*
09:31:48 <ibid> SamB: not really
09:32:06 <xerox> A templating engine?
09:32:10 <Saulzar> Maze solver
09:32:13 <xerox> Sudokus?
09:32:17 <musasabi> functional images ala pancito ?
09:32:19 <ibid> xerox: hmm, that might be a good one
09:32:22 <SamB> dcoutts: but Java is... Java.
09:32:29 * xerox wheeees!
09:32:34 <SamB> ooh, maze solver as dynamic program ;-)
09:32:36 <dcoutts> SamB, yeah, it's much quicker to write in Haskell
09:32:43 <ibid> xerox: but please continue if you have more :)
09:32:54 <dcoutts> my prof set Sudoku as a tute sheet exercise one week
09:32:55 * xerox thinks
09:32:57 <SamB> ... With the maze passed in as a function.
09:33:13 <xerox> I admit that mazes sound interesting too.
09:33:17 <dcoutts> I think they found it a bit hard as problem to solve on their own
09:33:34 <xerox> Tic tac toe is under-rated.
09:33:36 <Saulzar> It seems like it might be non trivial to do well...
09:33:44 <SamB> (together with the bounds of the maze)
09:34:04 <SamB> (as well as the starting point and destination)
09:34:04 <xerox> Hmm..
09:34:05 <musasabi> graph coloring can be fun
09:34:19 <xerox> That's nice too.
09:34:45 <SamB> data Dir = North | East | South | West
09:34:59 <xerox> It's not so fun, but from SICP, what about calculating derivatives.
09:35:26 <gzl> ew
09:35:27 <SamB> type Location = (Int,Int)
09:35:31 <gzl> boring
09:35:32 <xerox> SamB: I want a bi-dimensional zipper :-)
09:35:43 <SamB> bi-dimensional zipper?
09:35:44 <SamB> why?
09:35:56 <xerox> It's cool for backtracking
09:35:59 <SamB> oh
09:36:09 <musasabi> A zipper over a heterogenous tree would be nice too
09:36:10 <SamB> well, you don't need to backtrack in dynamic programming
09:36:14 <ibid> symbolic derivation might work
09:36:16 <xerox> musasabi: indeed.
09:36:20 <xerox> ibid: yeah!
09:36:52 * xerox mumbles some more
09:36:53 <SamB> from :: Dir -> Location -> Location
09:37:07 <xerox> Implement toroidal chess.
09:37:17 <benny> i've started making a gui for my haskell renderer:
09:37:21 <dcoutts> Heffalump, I bet you know abou the grammar of C
09:37:23 <Saulzar> What on earth is that xerox?
09:37:23 <benny> http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/7259/gtkhrayt0016th.png
09:37:27 <ibid> hmm, i'll ask them to build a symbolic algebra system :9
09:37:30 <ibid> (simple one)
09:37:45 <ibid> dcoutts: i might
09:37:54 <xerox> Saulzar, just chess... on a toroid :-)
09:38:00 <Heffalump> errm, not very well
09:38:04 <Heffalump> what do you want to know?
09:38:13 <dcoutts> Heffalump, ibid, someone found a bug in the c2hs C parser. I've identified the problem but am having real problems fixing it.
09:38:15 * ibid has read the C standard
09:38:17 <benny> it renders interactively, that's why there is the blue stipe on the bottom, it didn't quite finish rendering in that screenshot
09:38:48 <xerox> ibid: sold!
09:39:02 <SamB> data Maze = Maze { mazeBounds :: (Loc,Loc), canGo :: Dir -> Location -> Bool, start :: Location, goal :: Location }
09:39:05 <ibid> dcoutts: and?
09:39:06 <dcoutts> ibid, Heffalump: http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/c2hs/2005-December/000534.html
09:39:09 <ibid> ah
09:39:30 <Saulzar> benny, Nice - I recognise that shot :)
09:39:56 <araujo> Hello!
09:40:03 <benny> Saulzar: this is a very simple raytracer that i coded about 9 months ago, but haven't touched since. now i am adding a gui for it :)
09:40:03 <dcoutts> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/repos/c2hs/c2hs/c/CParser.y
09:40:10 <xerox> I think modelling some dynamical system is the coolest thing nowadays, maybe pool...
09:40:18 <ibid> dcoutts: would GLR help?
09:40:27 <Heffalump> what do you want to know?
09:40:38 <Heffalump> you seem to have diagnosed the issue correctly
09:40:41 <dcoutts> ibid, well gcc manages with bison
09:40:47 <ibid> dcoutts: i mean, accept the ambiguity in the grammar and use semantics to disamb
09:40:57 <ibid> dcoutts: yes, but as you say, it's difficult
09:41:06 <ibid> dcoutts: have you looked at the standard's grammar?
09:41:19 <dcoutts> ibid, yeah, it's wrong :-)
09:41:31 <SamB> dcoutts: I about had a fit when I got to types...
09:41:33 <ibid> the standard's grammar?
09:41:36 <dcoutts> ibid, at least all the versions I've seen do what I do.
09:41:40 <SamB> than gave up rather promptly.
09:41:50 <dcoutts> only the gcc one does the right thing it seems
09:42:03 <benny> btw, is the man in charge of gtk2hs here?
09:42:20 <ibid> dcoutts: istr the standard grammar has a production typedef-name : identifier
09:42:29 <ibid> or something similar
09:42:59 <dcoutts> Heffalump, so I think what I need to do is partition the grammar so that I can distinguish the case of a type spec appearing in the declaration specifiers list, because in that case it's ok to redefine type identifiers as variable names.
09:43:03 <ibid> benny: what makes you think it's a man? ;)
09:43:25 <SamB> benny: that would be dcoutts 
09:43:34 <Heffalump> I'm not sure why your _grammar_ is noticing that an identifier is a type-name, anyway.
09:43:39 * benny hopes that dcoutts is a man
09:43:43 <SamB> though who knows that he is not a robot?
09:43:44 <Heffalump> since that means that the strings it recognises have to change as it parses
09:43:45 <benny> dcoutts: did you write the fastdraw demo?
09:43:57 <musasabi> Does Data.Map really miss a function to get get all values between two keys.
09:43:57 <SamB> Heffalump: so?
09:43:58 <dcoutts> ibid, yeah it does. I don't get that. A typedef name is distinct from an identifier.
09:44:14 <ibid> dcoutts: how so?
09:44:20 <ibid> dcoutts: your big 
09:44:31 <ibid> dcoutts: your bug is a demonstration that it's not :)
09:44:34 <dcoutts> Heffalump, right we maintain a set of typedef names since they get recognised differently by the grammar.
09:44:35 * musasabi wants lookupBetween :: Ord k -> k -> k -> Map k v -> [(k,v)]
09:44:42 <dcoutts> benny, yeah I did.
09:44:48 * dcoutts is a man
09:44:50 <musasabi> that is lookupBetween :: Ord k => k -> k -> Map k v -> [(k,v)]
09:44:53 <benny> dcoutts: there's a bug...
09:44:59 <SamB> musasabi: okay
09:45:04 <dcoutts> benny, ok tell me later :-)
09:45:08 <SamB> we can do that
09:45:12 <benny> dcoutts: whatever you say boss :)
09:45:20 <musasabi> how?
09:45:31 <SamB> musasabi: hold a sec whilst I :b Data.Map
09:45:33 <dcoutts> Heffalump, we havediffernt tokens for identifers and typedefed identifiers
09:45:44 <ibid> dcoutts: i think that's the mistake
09:45:51 <ibid> (it's a common one, though)
09:45:52 <Heffalump> ah, so you get a problem later?
09:45:58 <musasabi> SamB: 2 * split + toList, but that is quite inefficient.
09:46:05 <SamB> musasabi: oh, well, so?
09:46:17 * Heffalump doesn't know anythign about the best ways to parse C, anyway.
09:46:21 <Heffalump> We contract all that out to EDG.
09:46:25 <dcoutts> ibid, but one has to distinguish typedefed names from other names.
09:46:30 <ibid> dcoutts: why?
09:46:44 <dcoutts> ibid, because the grammer has them as different terminals
09:46:44 <ibid> dcoutts: have you tried the other way?
09:46:46 <SamB> musasabi: would it be faster to filter the entire list of associations?
09:46:59 <ibid> dcoutts: blah. why does it do that?
09:47:06 <dcoutts> ibid, but they're indistinguishable lexically.
09:47:16 <ibid> dcoutts: obviously, i was suggesting merging those terminals
09:47:26 <ibid> dcoutts: does it generate problems?
09:47:32 <dcoutts> ibid, it's just one of the annoyances of the C grammar that it relies on the distinction.
09:47:34 <musasabi> SamB: no, it could have e.g. 50000 elements and the result set would be ~100 elements.
09:47:46 <ibid> dcoutts: the standard grammar has no such distinction
09:47:53 <dcoutts> ibid, sure it does.
09:48:02 <dcoutts> ibid, it means that there is feedback between the lexer and the parser. Which is not nice.
09:48:06 <ibid> dcoutts: no it doesn't. typedef-name is a NONTERMINAL
09:48:13 <SamB> musasabi: I think splits are your best bet then
09:48:23 <ibid> dcoutts: i know all that, and as i said, i think it is a mistake
09:48:33 <SamB> or maybe a split and a takeWhile
09:48:42 <musasabi> mm.. ok. (or I just use a local version with the added operation)
09:48:44 <SamB> What do you think?
09:48:52 <SamB> musasabi: what are you writing?
09:48:55 <benny> dcoutts: btw i have also figured out the fix for the bug
09:49:05 <ibid> dcoutts: i'd love to try it out, but i have an exercise set to publish, so i'm going to idle for a while
09:49:10 <dcoutts> benny, oh great
09:49:18 <benny> dcoutts: it's a very small fix
09:49:19 <dcoutts> ibid, I'll go look at the standard again
09:49:34 <dcoutts> benny, can you email the gtk2hs-devel list?
09:49:43 <benny> dcoutts: yeah, guess so
09:49:52 <dcoutts> ta benny 
09:50:07 <ibid> dcoutts: really, this is one of my pet problems, and i'd like to try it out myself, but can't now
09:50:16 <benny> i adapted the code for my own program and couldn't figure out why i was getting annoying gtk errors until i found this bug
09:50:30 <SamB> dcoutts: yeah, just figure it out in the parser...
09:50:48 <dcoutts> SamB, that's easier said than done.
09:50:54 <musasabi> SamB: range lookups from a large set of items with infrequent updates. (not open code unfortunately)
09:50:54 <SamB> true
09:51:06 <SamB> but its easier than feeding back and forth between lexer and parser!
09:51:18 <SamB> musasabi: ah
09:51:43 <SamB> yeah, I suppose forking Map is a reasonable way to go about it...
09:51:52 <dcoutts> the grammar here has them as different terminals: http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html
09:51:57 <SamB> would be nice if there was a .Internals module or something
09:52:17 <SamB> dcoutts: thats for C, isn't it?
09:52:25 <dcoutts> SamB, yes
09:52:35 <SamB> in C its rather easier to do that kind of feedback
09:52:52 <dcoutts> it's not too hard in Haskell either
09:53:05 <SamB> oh?
09:53:13 <dcoutts> the parser monad just maintains a set of typedefed identifiers
09:53:18 <dcoutts> it's already done
09:53:21 <dcoutts> it works
09:53:25 <dcoutts> (mostly)
09:53:28 <SamB> well yes
09:53:45 <dcoutts> it parses all of the glibc + X11 + Gtk headers
09:53:48 <SamB> the lexer runs in the parser monad, then?
09:53:55 <dcoutts> SamB, right
09:54:02 <musasabi> of course I can generate the function from outside Data.Map, but I feel dirty when violating export specifications.
09:54:06 <SamB> how does that work?
09:54:18 * SamB thought that was called "lexerless"
09:54:20 <dcoutts> SamB, the parser monad and the lexer monad are the same.
09:54:34 <robajs> is there something like haskell cookbook in one downloadable tarball?
09:54:44 <ibid> dcoutts: that's not the standard grammar
09:54:46 <dcoutts> SamB, the lexer is an action :: m Char
09:55:01 <dcoutts> ibid, oh?
09:55:19 <dcoutts> there's also: http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs48/references/c.html
09:55:23 <SamB> dcoutts: have you a copy of K&R, 2nd edition?
09:55:34 <dcoutts> SamB, sadly no.
09:55:49 <SamB> @google iso c99 download
09:55:50 <lambdabot> http://www.textrush.com/formatxdownload.htm
09:55:50 <dcoutts> besides I'm trying to parse C99 + gnu C extensions
09:55:56 <jethr0> i thought there were some uglinesses (non-LALR1 features) in C that yacc couldn't handle... or am i mixing that up with C++?
09:56:05 <SamB> hmm
09:56:16 <dcoutts> jethr0, that's the typedef issue I think
09:56:25 <yaarg> hrm anyone happen to know if there's a freenode irc node that allows connection on a port other than 6667?
09:56:30 <dcoutts> it can be done but needs communication between the lexer and parser
09:56:46 <dcoutts> jethr0, the gcc C parser is a yacc grammar
09:56:48 <jethr0> dcoutts, you mean ensuring that a type has been defined before use?
09:57:08 <jethr0> dcoutts, ok, so it must have been C++ then i was thinking about
09:57:20 <dcoutts> jethr0, no, I beleive the grammer actually depends on knowing if an identifer is a type name or not.
09:57:45 <jethr0> hmm
09:57:52 <SamB> yes it does
09:58:35 <SamB> dcoutts: have DCC?
09:58:55 <dcoutts> SamB, it doesn't seem to work on my client
09:59:07 * dcoutts has found the official C spec
09:59:22 <SamB> cool
10:00:17 <SamB> yaarg: you can SSH into a computer which is allowed to connect to port 6667...
10:00:37 <yaarg> SamB: that's what i've been doing for the past three years  :)
10:00:41 <SamB> ah
10:00:45 <SamB> so why stop now?
10:01:05 <SamB> you could also try tunneling ipv6
10:01:19 <ibid> dcoutts: the C99 standard is a book, and i recommend buying it if you do C stuff
10:01:25 <jethr0> why v6? port forwarding through ssh works just fine
10:01:29 <yaarg> because I don't have a server for 24/7 screen irssi anymore
10:01:35 <ibid> (it's also available as an obnoxiously licensed PDF)
10:01:37 <SamB> ah
10:01:41 <yaarg> but my university does ;)
10:01:46 <dcoutts> ibid, I don't do much C stuff. I just need to fix the c2hs parser.
10:02:13 <SamB> ibid: where is the obnoxious license?
10:02:22 <jethr0> yaarg, aren't there IRC proxies maybe?
10:04:39 <yaarg> jethr0: i'm looking into that atm :)
10:09:25 <ibid> SamB: hmm?
10:09:55 <SamB> ibid: I don't recall seeing it
10:10:59 <ibid> SamB: you get to see the license when you purchase the PDF
10:11:08 <SamB> purchase?
10:11:10 <ibid> SamB: there are no free PDFs of the standard
10:11:19 <SamB> ibid: near enough
10:11:19 <ibid> legal ones, anyway
10:11:43 <ibid> there are drafts, but i'm not talking about the drafts, i'm talking about *the standard*
10:11:46 <SamB> they don't say "OMG! I AM ILLEGAL!" on them...
10:12:47 <jethr0> yaarg, i haven't found anything ;-(
10:12:52 <ibid> (and even the drafts are really only illegally available nowadays)
10:13:20 <ibid> SamB: they don't have to. you must assume illegality unless there's specific reason to think otherwise
10:13:30 <SamB> but its a standard!
10:13:35 <SamB> how can it be illegal?
10:13:46 <ibid> the standard is not illegal
10:13:53 <jethr0> as far as i know ISO charges for all its standards, no?
10:13:53 <ibid> copies of it may be illegal to distribute
10:13:57 <ibid> true
10:14:06 <SamB> this one also says "ANSI" on it
10:14:09 <ibid> SamB: most standards cost money, alas
10:14:16 <ibid> SamB: ANSI is almost as bad
10:14:28 <ibid> (the obnoxious license is from ANSI, btw)
10:14:49 <ibid> (or rather, their reseller)
10:14:52 <yaarg> ah well, i'm using my under-the-sofa media box as my irc screen atm, just i occasionally pull the plug :)
10:14:53 <SamB> anyway, for some reason I can't feel bad about the probability that my copy is illegal.
10:15:38 <ibid> SamB: the fact that it's a draft also makes it suspect of factuality
10:15:43 <jethr0> hmm, i wonder whether the gnu guys ever bought the standard, and if so whether it's alright to republish it in machine readable form ;-))
10:16:02 <Cale> you might be hurting ISO's feelings
10:16:02 <SamB> mine doesn't actually claim to be a draft...
10:16:11 <SamB> good, then!
10:16:13 <ibid> jethr0: you need the copyright holder's permission to publish it
10:16:19 <ibid> SamB: ok. where did you get it?
10:16:26 <ibid> +from
10:16:26 <SamB> actually, bookwarez
10:16:30 <Cale> <ISO> :(
10:16:45 <xerox> hahah.
10:16:58 <ibid> SamB: scanned from the book? that's a different story then
10:17:07 <SamB> nope, its not a scan.
10:17:17 <ibid> i was assuming you had one of the near-ubiquitous "final drafts"
10:17:22 <ibid> ok. what is it then?
10:17:27 <SamB> its all at right angles and with a table of contents and all
10:17:38 <ibid> photocopied?
10:17:51 <ibid> right angles?
10:18:15 <SamB> its pure digital, mmkay?
10:18:23 <jethr0> http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CombinedQueryResult.CombinedQueryResult?queryString=ISO%2FIEC+9899
10:18:25 <dcoutts> http://www.textrush.com/download/c_international_standard.zip
10:18:40 <jethr0> costs 340 dollars
10:18:48 <ibid> SamB: where did you get it?
10:18:49 <ibid> from
10:18:56 <SamB> bookwarez, I said
10:19:00 <ibid> jethr0: the ansi version is ~20$
10:19:04 <ibid> SamB: define bookwarez
10:19:14 <ibid> SamB: that's where i got the idea it was photocopied
10:19:18 <ibid> or scanned
10:19:19 <SamB> the group of IRC channels
10:19:31 <jethr0> ibid, ok, but isn't that the _same_ standard??
10:19:39 <ibid> ah ok. you might then have a genuine pirated copy :)
10:19:43 <ibid> jethr0: yes, it is
10:19:50 <jethr0> that's just plain stupid
10:20:00 <ibid> jethr0: it's weird, not stupid :)
10:20:13 <SamB> jethr0: no, its very smart of ANSI to sell it for a fraction of the price
10:20:31 <ibid> jethr0: the same standard is also sold as a book under the "British standard" label for a normal computer book's price
10:20:40 <jethr0> yeah, but who wants to be ansi certified?
10:20:57 <ibid> jethr0: who said anything about certification?
10:21:08 <Axioplase> Hi
10:21:13 <Axioplase> @type sort
10:21:14 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `sort'
10:21:19 <jethr0> well, you buy the document for a reason don't you. especially if it is also available as a book
10:21:25 <ski> @type Data.List.sort
10:21:26 <lambdabot> forall a. (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
10:21:27 <dcoutts> ibid, yeah, I don't see from reading the standard that it does distinguish typedef identifiers from ordinary identifiers
10:21:33 <jethr0> so you intend to do something and claim it conforms to ISO/ANSI C, right?
10:21:38 <Axioplase> ski: thks
10:21:42 <dcoutts> ibid, that might make things easier.
10:22:14 <dcoutts> and faster too (possibly)
10:23:07 <Axioplase> ski: but I'd rather need a (a->a)->[a]->[a] sort function... 
10:23:10 <ibid> dcoutts: the K&R2 grammar also does that, and they claim it's a near-LARL grammar with only a coule SR-conflicts that the standard resolution resolves correctly
10:23:18 <jethr0> sortBy?
10:23:21 <ski> @type Data.List.sortBy
10:23:22 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
10:23:25 <Axioplase> because I need two different orders on same data.
10:23:30 <Axioplase> ha great.
10:23:53 <jethr0> axioplase, what are you ordering?
10:24:02 <xerox> Pizza, for me, thanks.
10:24:02 <ibid> jethr0: you buy the document so that you have the genuine document. you don't get any certification as a bonus
10:24:10 <jethr0> ;-)
10:24:29 <ibid> i'll take a ruisburger, thanks
10:24:43 <dcoutts> ibid, the original parser I started from distinguished two kinds of identifiers and it was written straight from K&R. So I kept the same concept.
10:25:00 <jethr0> well, give a document as hideous as the C standard, you are just as bad off with it as without :P
10:25:18 <Axioplase> jethr0: I'm ordering 2d points with Cartesian order, and with Polar order.
10:25:46 <jethr0> axioplase, cool, and then?
10:26:01 <ibid> jethr0: the C standard is quite good, actually (though one would like formal definition, of course, but even haskell lacks that)
10:26:03 <SamB> and whats the diff between a final draft and a published standard?
10:26:06 <Axioplase> jethr0: and then, doing a convex wrap (?) on random points.
10:26:13 <ibid> SamB: small
10:26:23 <SamB> it can't be whole lot, or they would do another draft, and then it wouldn't be the final draft anymore...
10:26:54 <jethr0> ibid, it's a nightmare for compiler writers as far as i know, because it leaves everything undefined; even down to evaluation order stuff like "a[++x] = ++x"
10:26:54 <ibid> remember, if a document says it's a final draft, it doesn't mean there isn't a newer draft out there :)
10:27:03 <SamB> true!
10:27:16 <SamB> they ought to call them release-candidate
10:27:32 <ibid> jethr0: actually, that's quite the opposite: it's a nightmare for *programmers*; leaving stuff undefined is *easier* for the implementors
10:27:43 <SamB> @quote SamB
10:27:43 <lambdabot>  C is a good language. If what you want is an assembly language where you
10:27:43 <lambdabot> can't be sure what anything does
10:27:49 <jethr0> yes, but worst for cross-compiler compatibility
10:27:54 <SamB> exactly the quote I wanted ;-)
10:27:55 <dcoutts> benny, so what effects does that bug cause?
10:27:58 <jethr0> worse*
10:28:02 <ibid> jethr0: that's not implementor's problem
10:28:10 <SamB> see that quote there?
10:28:16 <jethr0> *great*
10:29:05 <jethr0> axioplase, tell me if i'm bugging you, but why can't you do the convex hull (if that's it) in either cartesian OR polar?
10:29:20 <SamB> um.
10:29:22 <SamB> polar?
10:29:32 <SamB> you can't do a lot in polar, can you?
10:29:45 <jethr0> samb, actually you can be sure what C does as long as you don't tread the undefined territories!
10:29:52 <SamB> jethr0: yes.
10:30:02 <SamB> but for an assembly language...
10:30:04 <jethr0> then again, what C++ does, nobody knows
10:30:22 <dcoutts> benny, I don't think your fix is right.
10:30:23 <ibid> actually not true :)
10:30:41 <Axioplase> jethr0: it is in polar only, but the polar order means two points are left of each other if angle equals Pi/2. That's why I do a cartesian sort before.
10:31:01 <jethr0> ibid, well you can, but you have to study it for 30 years, write 5 compilers and hope that nobody add stuff like STL or boost to the standard
10:31:11 <Axioplase> err.. Do I need this one really? I can't remember...
10:31:38 <ibid> jethr0: STL is already in
10:31:47 <jethr0> ibid, i know, i was speaking historically :P
10:31:56 <ibid> that used to be true
10:32:01 <ibid> but the standard has added stability
10:32:14 <jethr0> axioplase, you mean two adjacent points can be 2*pi difference in angle?
10:33:39 <jethr0> ibid, still, getting exception safety right in C++ is not a job for your average programming dufus...
10:33:46 <jethr0> and i'm not excluding myself from that!
10:34:15 <Axioplase> hum... my if a,b and c are aligned, then a is left of c and c is left of a
10:34:18 <araujo> @index exitWith
10:34:19 <lambdabot> System.Exit
10:34:45 <jethr0> i don't get it
10:34:50 <Axioplase> jethr0: but that nukes the whole order when sorting points since either a or c can be chosen to be first.
10:35:16 <jethr0> it's a half-order then (or whatever the correct english term)
10:35:17 <araujo> @index sort
10:35:20 <lambdabot> Data.List
10:35:42 <Axioplase> (in polar order, we compare to points to a lign or to another points. if they are align with the comparison point, then it's bad.
10:35:54 <jethr0> axioplase, i still don't get how "a < c" and "c < a" for different points a,c and "<" meaning "lies left of"
10:36:20 <ibid> jethr0: true, true
10:36:34 <Axioplase> a left of c  roughly means (oc,oa) < pi/2
10:36:39 <araujo> @index getargs
10:36:40 <lambdabot> bzzt
10:36:41 <araujo> @index getArgs
10:36:42 <lambdabot> System.Environment
10:37:13 <araujo> mmm......
10:37:19 <jethr0> axioplase, there's no operator in there. do you mean (-)?
10:42:19 <Axioplase> jethr0: well, sort was Ord a -> [a] -> [a], and since I have two different orderings (cart and polar), I couldn't use it. but sortBy did the job.
10:42:59 <jethr0> cool
10:43:08 <Axioplase> though, is it O(n log n) or O(n^2) ? On arrays, sorting is O(n^2) but with lists, it's more expensive...
10:44:29 <Axioplase> because my whole prog complexit doesn't look like O(n log n) at all... rather O(n log(n)*log(n)).. maybe the sorts are the reason..
10:47:35 <shapr> hi SyntaxNinja 
10:50:51 <dcoutts> benny, well you got plenty of replies to your bug report :-)
10:57:33 * araujo boings
10:58:04 <SyntaxNinja> hiya shapr
10:58:08 <SyntaxNinja> quiet today (not complaining)
10:58:19 <SyntaxNinja> how is everyone?
10:59:04 <araujo> Fine here.
11:00:23 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, I though all the discussion over shipments was quite noisy :-)
11:03:48 * shapr hugs cabal
11:04:08 <shapr> Cabal lets me upgrade my own personal version of standard GHC libs, I love it!
11:05:20 <shapr> What's a good name for an HUnit test builder that expects a to match a monadic value to a pure input?
11:05:34 <shapr> ~?= becomes ~>= maybe ?
11:12:00 <benny> dcoutts: sorry, was away
11:13:31 <shapr> Yay, I like my new HUnit operators.
11:13:40 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: were they taling aout shipments here without me?
11:14:07 <shapr> Anyone written any cool code lately?
11:15:15 <SyntaxNinja> oh bugger, I forgot to read libraries@ today
11:18:24 <palomer> air hockey wounds suck
11:18:36 <palomer> it's probably the worst sport to play for a computer scientist
11:18:59 <jethr0> if it is a sport at all :P
11:19:15 <gzl> air hockey is good
11:20:32 <genneth> shapr: i worked through some epigram stuff...
11:20:51 <palomer> receiving a puck on your thumb can put a computer scientist out of order for 3 days!
11:21:42 <SyntaxNinja> palomer: that's why you have 2 thumbs
11:21:47 <SyntaxNinja> (at least)
11:22:33 <palomer> SyntaxNinja: because of air hockey wounds?
11:22:39 <palomer> I guess my creator was intelligent
11:25:16 <jethr0> he might even have "designed" you "intelligently"...
11:25:58 <benny> shapr: i've started to add a gui to that raytracer thing i wrote a year ago:

11:27:23 <jethr0> cool, it's the three spheres again...
11:27:43 <jethr0> four
11:32:36 <Axioplase> http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=ocaml&lang2=ghc <-- could this explain why my algo is sooo slow? I mean... It looks like GHC can't handle memory well :/
11:35:10 <jethr0> 1) the shootout isn't exactly reliable, 2) ocaml is pretty fast/good, 3) making things strict can often reduce memory consumption immensly
11:35:21 <Cale> jethr0: yeah, it was originally benny's raytracer that I was working on when I made my picture of them
11:35:30 <Axioplase> jethr0: right...
11:35:31 <jethr0> :)
11:35:52 <jethr0> axioplase, what kind of _slow_ are we talking about
11:36:02 <Cale> which algorithm?
11:36:04 <jethr0> and on what scale of input are you working
11:36:41 <jethr0> sorting points and building convex hulls, or something
11:43:11 <Cale> shapr: you have your own version of the GHC libs?
11:44:40 <Cale> Axioplase: GHC isn't bad at handling memory, but you have to understand the way in which it evaluates things to really be able to guess where lots of memory is going to be used.
11:44:58 <palomer> heh, I'm working on a ray tracer right now
11:45:04 <Cale> :)
11:45:11 <jethr0> who isn't :P
11:45:24 <Cale> I should get back to writing mine :)
11:45:25 <Saulzar> I've stopped :)
11:45:30 <Cale> hehe
11:45:42 <palomer> what's the point of a ray tracer:O?
11:45:46 <jethr0> me too, but i'll get back to it to at least implement CSG and scene graphs
11:45:56 <Saulzar> pretty pictures
11:46:04 <Cale> Someone should write a raytracer which uses L^2(R) instead of R^3
11:46:08 <palomer> just use opengl for the pretty pictures
11:46:19 <jethr0> L?
11:47:03 <Cale> L^2(R) is the unique Hilbert space with a countably infinite Hilbert basis.
11:47:25 <Saulzar> Yow.
11:47:37 <palomer> and what does it have to do with R^3
11:47:55 <jethr0> cale, is that projectable to R^2 and how does s projected sphere look like?
11:48:17 <jethr0> sensibly*
11:48:59 <Cale> Well, it ought to be, though the computation involved would be somwhat ridiculous
11:49:06 <Cale> and involve lots of approximation
11:49:32 <jethr0> cool. and _i'm_ struggling with torusses and quartic polynomials *tststs*
11:49:37 <Cale> Basically, you can imagine your vectors as square integrable functions on R
11:50:10 <Cale> that is, functions such that the integral over R of (f(x))^2 dx exists
11:50:38 <Cale> and your inner product looks like <f,g> = integral over R of f(x) g(x) dx
11:51:43 <jethr0> hmm, i've never really like the hilbert/... spaces. it always made me feel like i hadn't studied my maths hard enough :(
11:52:02 <Cale> Banach spaces are worse
11:52:09 <jethr0> ya, those too
11:52:18 <Cale> At least with Hilbert spaces *some* intuition is left.
11:52:38 <Cale> With Banach spaces you get all kinds of crazy things happening.
11:52:53 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: I've rejoined the fray ;)
11:52:55 <Saulzar> Where as I *know* I hadn't studied my math hard enough, given that I have not heard of either :)
11:53:01 <jethr0> interestingly, most brilliant mathematics have a very tangible intuition for their fields...
11:53:06 <jethr0> maybe that's what i'm lacking!
11:53:14 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: I can't say that I like JaffaCake's --local=../ thing
11:53:19 <Cale> Yeah, it just takes lots of time and effort
11:53:45 <Cale> Eventually you boil all those theorems down into a coherent, not-so-conveyable picture of what's going on.
11:54:52 <palomer> calculus is for chumps!
11:55:14 <jethr0> algebra is da sh*t
11:55:23 <Cale> palomer: we're talking about functional analysis though :)
11:55:37 <palomer> oh, that's ok
11:56:01 <palomer> I don't like the language of functional analysis though
11:56:34 <palomer> isn't functional analysis the analysis of functionals?
11:56:38 <jethr0> i really hate simple integration and differentiation. but when you advance far enough into algebra it _can_ become quite interesting...
11:56:54 <Cale> There's some crazy stuff out there. Apparently there's a function f: R -> R, differentiable on all of R, such that the sets on which its derivative is positive, negative, and zero, are all dense.
11:57:26 <Cale> (dense in R)
11:57:29 <jethr0> weird
11:57:30 <palomer> Cale: computable?
11:57:37 <Cale> palomer: probably not.
11:57:58 <Cale> I haven't actually seen the construction
11:58:07 <jethr0> i can't even see how that is possible
11:58:27 <Cale> hehe
11:58:47 <palomer> x*sin(x) satisfies 2 of the three criteria
11:58:58 <tic> = x^2 for small values of x!
11:59:24 <jethr0> wouldn't disjunct, adjacent sets fulfill the constraints? like [0..5] -> positive, (5,10]-> negative, (10,..) zero?
11:59:26 <Cale> um, no
11:59:48 <Cale> x * sin(x) is differentiable on all of R, but none of those three sets is dense in R
11:59:50 <jethr0> i formulated that badly, but does dense include infinte extent?
12:00:02 <palomer> oh, righto
12:00:28 <Cale> A set S is dense in R if for any x in R, and e > 0, there exists s in S such that |s-x| < e
12:00:31 <roconnor> palomer, I suspect it would be computable.
12:00:45 <Cale> For example, Q, the set of rationals, is dense in the reals.
12:01:04 <jethr0> ok, forgot that it had to be dense in R...

12:02:43 <jethr0> cale, wtf?
12:02:53 <Cale> You haven't seen the list monad?
12:03:06 <jethr0> sure, but the [] form applied to monad operations still freaks me out
12:03:34 <jethr0> who's concatenating them?

12:06:52 <SamB> yes
12:06:59 <Cale> hmm
12:07:20 <Cale> what happens if you just try running the produced binary?
12:07:29 <SamB> the -inplace script doesn't work and the binary complains about a missing -B<dir> option
12:08:03 <Cale> what does the -inplace script do?
12:08:11 <SamB> ghc-6.5: no input files
12:08:22 <Cale> interesting :)

12:08:30 <Cale> oh
12:08:32 <palomer> omg, printf doesn't have a manpage on debian
12:08:43 <SamB> palomer: sure it does

12:08:55 <SamB> try "man 3 printf"?
12:09:00 <Cale> it has a few of them

12:10:58 <SamB> one for GL

12:12:24 <mwc> I just got some of my textbooks for next term. I was flipping through my computer simulations course book, and oh good lord, what a laugh. First, they talk about why they use TrueBASIC for all the examples (it's low cost and runs on all major platforms)
12:12:34 <mwc> then they mention Fortran, C, and Pascal
12:12:51 <Cale> mwc: sigh.
12:12:53 <Roboguy> Heh heh
12:12:58 <mwc> and a one sentence comment about functional languages such as LISP, which are expressive but slow
12:13:00 <mwc> Okay
12:13:15 <mwc> so I was starting to think these guys were on crack
12:13:16 <Roboguy> Apparently they are still living in the 50s, if they think that...
12:13:16 <Cale> when was the book written?
12:13:24 <mwc> 1996
12:13:32 <mwc> Anyways
12:13:36 <araujo> > ([[2 , 5 , 4] >>= (\ s -> return [s + 1])) ==  [x + 1] | x <- [2,5,4] ]

12:13:48 <mwc> the best part is when they turn around later and talk about "Strong typing and debugging"
12:13:49 <araujo> > ([2 , 5 , 4] >>= (\ s -> return [s + 1])) ==  [x + 1] | x <- [2,5,4] ]

12:13:54 <ADEpt> jlouis: got you comments, thanks!
12:13:58 <araujo> > ([2 , 5 , 4] >>= (\ s -> return [s + 1])) ==  [[x + 1] | x <- [2,5,4] ]
12:13:59 <lambdabot> True
12:14:07 <araujo> But the former is more fun :-]
12:14:57 <mwc> "If you happen to mistype dt as dr, you will have a difficult to spot bug because True BASIC or fortran will run your program. A langauge like Pascal will spot this error, since it requires all variables to be defined before being used. This is called "Strong Typing."
12:15:07 <mwc> I think I just about choked a fry out my nose at that point
12:15:27 <SamB> mwc: you should ask for a refund!
12:15:31 <jethr0> mwc, that's actually really funny
12:15:46 <jethr0> so, this is your _actual_ textbook at college?
12:16:09 <SamB> in fact, you should challange the class
12:16:20 <Roboguy> Still, didn't they have optimizing LISP compilers in '96?
12:16:28 <SamB> Roboguy: sure
12:16:43 <SamB> they haven't sprung into life in the 9 years since then, thats for sure...
12:16:52 <jethr0> i guess lisp didn't have to fear truebasics competition for some time now!
12:16:55 <mwc> SamB, that was my though, this textbook is useless
12:17:04 <wearpants> is there anything similar to scanl that gives me the result list *and* the final parameter?
12:17:07 <wearpants> @type scanl
12:17:07 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> [a]
12:17:16 <mwc> Well, I'm sure the modelling aspects are acceptable
12:17:21 <wearpants> er, maybe it's map then
12:17:30 <SamB> @type mapAccumL
12:17:31 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `mapAccumL'

12:17:38 <wearpants> ah
12:17:49 <wearpants> what is acc?
12:17:52 <SamB> @type List.accumL
12:17:53 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `List.accumL'
12:17:54 <wearpants> any type?
12:17:55 <mwc> but I'm going to take their 'programming tips' with a Pacific-size load of salt
12:17:56 <SamB> @type List.accum
12:17:57 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `List.accum'
12:18:06 <wearpants> SamB - I can look it up, don't worry about it.
12:18:21 <SamB> what was the type you desired?
12:19:03 <SamB> we can hoogle it if you know what you want...
12:19:07 <wearpants> I'm not sure ;)
12:19:12 <wearpants> let me think for a moment
12:19:29 <SamB> thats generally necessary to answer such questions ;-)
12:19:36 <wearpants> I know
12:19:59 <wearpants> but I'm thinking about what I want to do intuitively. There's a design pattern, and it's frustrating me because I know there must be a way to express this with monads or something else.
12:20:24 <SamB> well, what are you trying to do?
12:20:27 <wearpants> monads allow you to perform computations involving state easily since the monad itself maintains the state for you
12:20:46 <wearpants> ok, well, I have a list [a] that I want to transform into [a]
12:20:51 <jethr0> from wikipedia: "However, [..] this is an uncommon feature, and therefore portable brainfuck programs do not depend on it."
12:21:12 <wearpants> but in order to do the transformation, I need some state
12:21:14 <SamB> jethr0: what feature?
12:21:16 <Roboguy> wearpants: Will map work? Maybe list comprehensions?
12:21:23 <SamB> wearpants: what state?
12:21:24 <wearpants> Roboguy - map won't work
12:21:28 <jethr0> infinite tape extent to the left
12:21:30 <wearpants> each object in the list is assigned an identifier
12:21:32 <SamB> jethr0: ah
12:21:44 <wearpants> an integer, rather
12:21:45 <jethr0> i just liked the way they talk about the class of "portable brainfuck programs" :)))
12:21:52 <wearpants> and each has to be unique across the entire list
12:22:09 <SamB> jethr0: there are some, you know
12:22:25 <wearpants> so I have to keep track of the next available integer
12:22:38 <wearpants> map would work fine if the integer did not depend on previous results
12:22:41 <jethr0> sure, and with the easy to port compiler, this might just as well prove to be the next mainstream language :)
12:22:52 <SamB> zip xs [0..] ?
12:23:06 <SamB> zip [0..] xs ?
12:23:10 <wearpants> I thought to use scanl, but I guess that doesn't make much sense. I could write this myself easily, but there must be a "standard" way to do this.
12:23:35 <wearpants> SamB - well each object is actually a node in a recursive data structure that represents an abstract syntax tree
12:23:54 <wearpants> I'm trying to process objects of type Block which, obviously, hold a list of statements
12:24:14 <SamB> uh huh?
12:24:26 <ski> > List.mapAccumL (\acc n -> (acc+n,acc+n) 0 [1..10]
12:24:27 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `}'
12:24:33 <ski> > List.mapAccumL (\acc n -> (acc+n,acc+n)) 0 [1..10]

12:24:46 <lambdabot> forall b (m :: * -> *) a. (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
12:24:48 <wearpants> SamB - I'm trying to rewrite the syntax tree and assign a unique tag to each node. Looks like mapAccumL might be what I want.
12:25:07 <SamB> wearpants: and this structure has no folds on it?
12:25:09 * ski wonders if List.mapAccumL isn't just mapM in the state monad
12:25:25 <wearpants> SamB - folds? You mean it is a tree in the strict sense of the word -- with no cycles?
12:25:28 * SamB can't help but wonder if the Data class wouldn't help
12:25:38 <SamB> wearpants: does it have cycles then?
12:25:43 <wearpants> no, no cycles
12:25:47 <SamB> good
12:25:59 <wearpants> yes, since otherwise the recursion would be difficult to terminate, heh
12:26:02 <SamB> folds on it are functions similar to foldr
12:26:12 <SamB> true!
12:26:36 <SamB> I would say "cycles" if I meant cycles ;-)
12:26:44 <ski> wearpants : have you tried mapM in State monad ?
12:26:50 <wearpants> ok, well, I wasn't sure if the terms were equivalent
12:27:01 <wearpants> ski - nope.
12:27:24 <wearpants> I'm still a relative novice to Haskell, and to be honest, even though I understand how the State monad works, I don't understand how to use it.
12:27:28 <SamB> that might be nice, but I still think "boil your scrap plate" would be a nice approach
12:27:36 <wearpants> SamB - ??
12:28:00 <SamB> rather, "scrap your boilerplate"... its a lame a attempt at humour...
12:28:11 <wearpants> it was lost on me

12:29:00 <wearpants> actually, mapAccumL is perfect
12:29:06 <SamB> oh, well, whatever
12:29:20 <wearpants> *nods* I'll have a look at that, too
12:29:20 <SamB> I haven't really quite figured out how to use that myself...
12:29:35 <wearpants> well, mapAccumL is the way that I would have written it, myself ;)
12:29:37 <SamB> (Data.Generics, not mapAccumL)
12:29:54 <SamB> well, since it is you that is writing it, I suppose thats best ;-)
12:30:25 <SamB> plus, the compile time will be much better ;-)
12:30:32 <jethr0> samb, the data.generics docu is nice, but any ideas to use it / examples?
12:30:39 <jethr0> i don't even know what the code is for...
12:30:59 <wearpants> *nods*
12:31:06 <wearpants> this is so small that compile-time is pretty much a non-issue
12:31:15 <cjb> Evenin' all. 
12:31:21 <Roboguy> Hello
12:31:29 <SamB> jethr0: its for dealing with large datastructures which you aren't terribly interested in most of
12:31:40 <SamB> or something like that
12:31:54 <jethr0> ah, ok
12:32:01 <Cale> jethr0: Y.Katznelson, K.Stromberg "Everywhere differentiable, nowhere monotone functions" American mathematical monthly (Apr. 1974) pp. 349-354
12:32:14 <wearpants> it still occurs to me that somehow this is similar to a monad, but I don't feel like writing a monad just to do the mapping. ;)
12:32:17 <Cale> Contains a reasonably concrete construction
12:32:48 <SamB> I think it would be useful for things like InteractiveFictionDecompilers
12:32:52 <SamB> @wiki InteractiveFictionDecompilers
12:32:53 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/InteractiveFictionDecompilers
12:32:53 <Cale> If you don't have access to that journal, I could host the page images :)
12:33:17 <wearpants> I suppose it would be data Transform Int AbsSynTree...which is probably really the State monad
12:33:56 <ski> wearpants : i think this is exactly mapM in the state monad
12:34:05 * SamB would use a newtype over StateT Integer or State Integer
12:34:12 <jethr0> cale, thx, but as i said i'm not good at the algebra stuff
12:34:29 <wearpants> yes, probably :)
12:34:47 <Cale> jethr0: I'd consider this to be analysis myself :)
12:35:01 <ski> @type Data.List.mapAccumL
12:35:02 <lambdabot> forall y acc x. (acc -> x -> (acc, y)) -> acc -> [x] -> (acc, [y])
12:35:04 <ski> mapM :: (x -> State acc y) -> ([x] -> State acc y)
12:35:06 <jethr0> ok, everything with "... space" in it is algebra for me :P
12:35:14 <Cale> oh, that's odd :)
12:35:26 <jethr0> as i said, no idea what i'm talking 'bout
12:35:27 <SamB> @type mapM
12:35:28 <lambdabot> forall b (m :: * -> *) a. (Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
12:35:44 <Cale> I suppose there's algebraic geometry and topology
12:35:54 <Cale> those have spaces and are relatively algebraic
12:36:21 <Cale> other than that, most things concerning spaces tend to proceed from an analytic viewpoint
12:36:46 <Cale> well, there's linear algebra
12:37:12 <Cale> but when you get right down to it, all the properties which make vector spaces seem like spaces are the analysis ones
12:37:24 <wearpants> @pl \(x, y) -> (x, Just y)
12:37:25 <lambdabot> second Just
12:37:30 <wearpants> @type second
12:37:31 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `second'
12:37:38 <Cale> @type Control.Arrow.second
12:37:39 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) c d b.
12:37:39 <lambdabot> (Control.Arrow.Arrow a) =>
12:37:39 <lambdabot> a b c -> a (d, b) (d, c)
12:37:42 <SamB> hmm, how do I run ghci out of my source/build tree?
12:38:08 <jethr0> cale, not sure i agree, but maybe this is a moot point. maybe analysis and algebra are not really disjunct, and we're both talking about algebraic analysis
12:38:25 <Cale> I'd say that's fairly true
12:38:40 <jethr0> :P
12:41:51 <jethr0> cale, how fast would you say "parsec" is? can it realistically handle MBs of input?
12:41:53 <Cale> To me, "analysis" is generally that sort of mathematics which studies structures, usually spaces, by looking at their local structure, breaking them apart into small pieces. Algebra studies things by abstracting away specific details and seeing what can be said about larger categories of things in general, and it tends to be of a far more discrete nature.
12:42:09 <Cale> jethr0: MBs? For sure.
12:42:20 <SamB> it does no back tracking ;-)
12:42:22 <SamB> what kind of input?
12:42:47 <jethr0> nothing concrete, i'm just looking for something to parse to enhance my knowledge of parsec
12:43:14 <Cale> Parsec is reasonably fast -- I suppose it depends on what you mean by "fast" :)
12:44:21 <jethr0> cale, i guess they are not disjunct after all. seing how planes appear in geometry, analysis and algebra (the three main branches of mathematics) the differentiation becomes kinda hard
12:44:22 <SamB> jethr0: DSSSL
12:44:54 <jethr0> samb, what was dsssl again?
12:45:52 <SamB> jethr0: an SGML/XML transformation language, mostly
12:46:03 <SamB> it also does some kind of formatting, apparantly
12:46:12 <Cale> jethr0: I'd say that geometry permeates the rest of mathematics. We stick to studying things which have a bit of geometry in them because without the intuition that it gives, things get very hard.
12:46:28 <jethr0> analysis seems consuming to me (integration, differentiation, continuity, ...) while algebra is more of a constructing branch of mathematics (rings, fields, ...)
12:46:46 <jethr0> topology is as well geometry (in a sense) as algebra
12:47:19 <jethr0> s/consuming/[the opposite of constructive]/
12:47:53 <SamB> jethr0: destructive?
12:48:16 <Cale> Perhaps algebra is holism, while analysis is reductionism.
12:48:36 <jethr0> if i could've said it like that, i would *g*
12:48:41 * shapr too
12:49:04 <Cale> They do mix quite a lot though.
12:49:22 <jethr0> your point about geometry is quite true, although the set of invertible matrices is hard to visualize in geometric terms (for me at least)
12:50:12 <Cale> jethr0: I picture it as two disconnected blobs with a sort of plane shaped object wedged in between
12:50:24 <jethr0> "plane shaped"... that's nice
12:50:39 <Cale> well, it's of an arbitrary dimension
12:50:50 <jethr0> meta-plane
12:50:51 <Cale> You have those matrices with positive determinant and with negative determinant
12:51:10 <Cale> and they form the two connected components of GL(n)
12:51:25 <jethr0> *lalala*, i said _for me_ :P
12:51:32 <Cale> hehe, yeah
12:51:41 <Cale> anything like that takes some getting used to :)
12:51:58 * xerox tapes Cale showing off
12:52:02 <xerox> dum-de-dum
12:52:04 <Cale> hehe
12:52:22 <SamB> xerox: but you can't use your camcorder on IRC
12:52:25 <jethr0> are there actually any pitfalls with "try" in parsec?
12:52:34 <Cale> jethr0: performance
12:52:40 <SamB> space leaks
12:52:46 <Cale> try is how you get backtracking
12:52:49 <jethr0> right, some of us are equipped with night vision goggles to spot the occasional camcorder guy
12:52:49 <SamB> don't use it on anything that recurses
12:52:52 <xerox> disorder, death and disease
12:52:54 <Cale> hehe
12:53:04 <Cale> it's not *quite* that bad
12:53:07 <shapr> Maybe he meant he's logging this on a paper tape?
12:53:19 <jethr0> cool, on a paper stock ticker :P
12:53:20 <SamB> you can use it on identifiers, but I wouldn't use it on anything more complicated than that...
12:53:23 <xerox> shapr: pfui, turing machine's tape.
12:53:27 <shapr> neat
12:53:48 <jethr0> but then he could log all the time and wouldn't have to start it just when cale was showing off...
12:54:07 <shapr> y0 franka 
12:54:14 <shapr> franka: I quoted you on the pragprog list ...
12:54:19 <franka> Hi, shapr.
12:54:23 <franka> Uh oh.
12:54:25 * jethr0 wonders how the seek time on a turing machine tape would be...
12:54:27 <franka> About what?
12:54:27 <xerox> smile.
12:55:22 <xerox> http://haskell.galois.com/~paolo/taped-2154-091205.png
12:55:39 <jethr0> samb, ok, so it's not supposed to be used all the time, when you're just too lazy to refactor the grammar...
12:56:03 <SamB> jethr0: or when you KNOW its going to be practical to do
12:56:51 <jethr0> xerox, hah, now i got your ip... DoS'ing "localhost.localdomain" to no avail...
12:56:55 <franka> I hope it was not what I said about dynamic and late binding, because I dunno why the hell I said that.
12:57:11 <shapr> franka: About dynamically checked languages being languages without a library that allows static checking.
12:57:19 <shapr> I think that's an excellent insight.
12:57:49 <shapr> And the next step after that is incremental checking as in epigram.
12:57:59 <jethr0> guide is/was trying to put sth like that into python, but i'm not a huge fan of such late additions to a language...
12:58:22 <shapr> Maybe you're thinking of Starkiller?
12:58:38 <franka> Ah, OK.  That one is reasonable.
12:59:10 <franka> No, I was thinking of Scheme's macro system and what that Kevin guy said in the types III discussion.
12:59:24 <SamB> jethr0: python does look like its heading into decline...
13:00:08 <jethr0> hmm, one reason i went over to ruby... with all their "map, filter, lambda must die" paroles i started to feel uncomfortable there
13:00:09 <franka> Oh, maybe that was not addressed to me.
13:00:13 <shapr> I'm almost amazed that there's this recent burst of interest in monads from the imperative world.
13:00:25 <shapr> franka: Wasn't originally, but I am glad you answered.
13:00:56 <CosmicRay> hey shap
13:00:57 <CosmicRay> r
13:00:59 <SamB> jethr0: yeah, thats like... what in the world? I used those functions!
13:01:06 <shapr> hiya CosmicRay 
13:01:07 <jethr0> shapr, i looked a starkiller... but i was just saying that statical type checking libraries might be nice, but might also not fit into an existing programming paradigm
13:01:14 <jethr0> and appear patched on
13:01:14 <SamB> and lambda, too, of course...
13:01:29 <shapr> franka: Of course, I killed a thread of ~thirty messages by saying that...
13:01:57 <Roboguy> jethr0: I think they might keep them
13:02:02 <jethr0> they kept saying: well, list comprehension are better anyway so why not get rid of these higher order functions...
13:02:23 <franka> HOFs generalize list comprehensions.
13:02:46 <jethr0> roboguy, but still, many seemed to agree that lambda was just stupid, and maybe it is in python. but the general discussion drove me over to ruby
13:02:47 <SamB> jethr0: I know! I can't stand it!
13:02:52 <Roboguy> Well, you could use list comprehensions to replace map pretty easily, but filter wouldn't look so good and you couldn't replace reduce with them
13:03:11 <jethr0> i'm not arguing, just echoing the python community mainstream
13:03:13 <SamB> you have to admit that reduce is broken as it stands
13:03:32 <SamB> the mainstream is unfortunately a bit *too* mainstream
13:03:33 <jethr0> never used it. but python has its wards anyways
13:03:35 <Roboguy> jethr0: Python's lambda isn't particularly good, but I don't see how they can improve it without making out of place looking syntax for it
13:03:46 <jethr0> warts
13:03:50 <psi> isn't filter quite simple with list comprehensions?
13:03:55 <shapr> I thought I saw a post on LtU saying that there's some HOF stuff that can't be done with list comps.
13:04:02 * araujo thinks python's lambdas are a bad joke
13:04:11 <jethr0> shapr, i'm sure there is or at least not very readable
13:04:17 <Roboguy> psi: It isn't too bad, but in my opinion just using filter looks better
13:04:29 <SamB> yes, map and filter should stay
13:04:44 <Roboguy> [x for x in xs if pred(x)] == filter(xs, pred)
13:04:45 <psi> Roboguy, yeah. i like map better also.
13:04:47 <SamB> maybe they have no business being in C, but they should stay
13:05:04 <araujo> Now you talk abuot that, are map/filter implemented through list compre. in the Prelude?
13:05:10 <jethr0> it's not so much a technical issue for me, but rather one of bashing the functional roots and trying to deny that python might not be a "pure" imperative language
13:05:27 <jethr0> nah
13:05:47 <SamB> no, not really a technical issue...
13:05:54 <SamB> araujo: more like the other way round
13:05:56 <Roboguy> Apparently Guido thinks they are hard to understand.  At least, that's what I've gathered
13:06:08 <SamB> Roboguy: maybe guido is an idiot?
13:06:19 <jethr0> that's a bit harsh...
13:06:31 <syntaxfree> maybe Guido is an OO zealot.
13:06:32 <jethr0> at least python is better than perl. although not as functional :P
13:06:33 <SamB> well, or does he think other people have trouble with them?
13:06:34 <shapr> Did you see Guido's 2003 post about iteration vs recursion?
13:06:40 <Roboguy> I might be able to understand people having a hard time understanding some complicated folds, but map and filter aren't exactly difficult
13:06:49 <SamB> shapr: not to my knowledge
13:06:51 <CosmicRay> shapr: I almost have the first database binding (sqlite3) for HDBC completed.
13:06:52 <Roboguy> shapr: Don't think so
13:06:57 <syntaxfree> shapr: where? where?
13:06:57 <shapr> CosmicRay: nifty!
13:07:01 <shapr> syntaxfree: I'll dig it up...
13:07:10 <psi> Roboguy, i think it was folds in particular he found hard
13:07:10 <syntaxfree> thanks :)
13:07:31 <CosmicRay> shapr: I figure it will be about 2 hours per binding after this.
13:07:35 <SamB> well, why does he want to drop map and filter if reduce is the one that gives him grief?
13:07:38 <Roboguy> psi: Yeah, I think I remember him saying that
13:07:57 <lisppaste2> syntaxfree pasted "why would the tree ever have negative values?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/14479
13:08:03 <roconnor> catamorphisms are awsome!
13:08:10 <SamB> roconnor: yes!
13:08:25 <SamB> but reduce has a bad interface
13:08:27 <Roboguy> Catamorphisms are [a] -> b, right?
13:08:35 <SamB> @type foldr
13:08:35 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
13:08:43 <syntaxfree> why does reduce have a bad interface?
13:08:49 <SamB> its too complicated
13:08:56 <syntaxfree> maybe foldl1 has a bad interface. foldl is pretty simple.
13:08:58 <jethr0> i liked this quote from some pretty professional seeming guys' C# tutorial:
13:09:03 <jethr0> "Anonymous methods can also make use of the local variables and parameters in whose scope the anonymous method lies. This is a somewhat complicated, and we don't yet have a clear idea of when one should exploit it. So to illustrate it we'll borrow the example from the documentation."
13:09:04 <SamB>     reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value
13:09:15 <roconnor> The wiki taught me that catamorphisms are like a search and replace, chaning data constructors to functions.
13:09:42 <SamB> roconnor: yuppo
13:09:44 <syntaxfree> anyway, can anyone look at my lisppaste?
13:09:53 <franka> A catamorphism is a way to assign semantics to a syntax.
13:09:55 <jethr0> some features are simply lost on the more imperative programmer...
13:09:58 <syntaxfree> I get negative values when I obviously shouldn't. Maybe the Int type is being overflown?
13:10:08 <psi> http://www.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/regrets/PythonRegrets.pdf
13:10:12 <franka> The initial algebra is the syntax.  The algebra is the semantics.  The catamorphism is the assignment.
13:10:21 <Saulzar> jethr0, If you've never seen anything like it then it just seems like wierd magic...
13:10:27 <jethr0> hehe
13:10:28 <SamB> > foldl (flip (:)) [1..10]
13:10:29 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Show ([b] -> [b]))
13:10:38 <psi> "list comprehensions do they same thing better"
13:10:40 <SamB> > foldl (flip (:)) [1..10] :: [Int]
13:10:40 <psi> the*
13:10:41 <lambdabot>   Expecting a function type, but found `[Int]'
13:10:41 <lambdabot>   Expected type: [Int]
13:10:41 <lambdabot>   Inferred type: [b] -> a
13:10:46 <SamB> > foldl (flip (:)) [] [1..10] :: [Int]
13:10:47 <lambdabot> [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
13:10:48 <syntaxfree> list comprehension are maps.
13:10:52 <jethr0> syntaxfree, tried using "Integer" instead?
13:11:00 <syntaxfree> hmm. I will.
13:11:00 <roconnor> you will get negative values after 32 or 64 iterations or so.
13:11:03 <SamB> syntaxfree: and filters
13:11:09 <SamB> they also do filters
13:11:17 <SamB> some of them are even zips
13:11:22 <shapr> syntaxfree: I can't find it... but I know where it is...
13:11:23 <syntaxfree> oh, and filters.
13:11:29 <syntaxfree> shapr: nevermind :)
13:11:29 <shapr> Guido has an ars technica weblog
13:11:31 <syntaxfree> it's not worth it.
13:11:31 <SamB> speaking of which, I don't imagine guido thought to get rid of zip?
13:11:40 <shapr> in 2003 he saw a talk given by SPJ of all people...
13:11:52 <shapr> And he concluded from that talk that iteration was more basic than recursion.
13:11:56 <syntaxfree> yay!
13:11:59 <syntaxfree> Integer fixes it.
13:12:05 <shapr> He has been parodied viciously off and on since then...
13:12:09 <syntaxfree> How odd that overflown Ints lead to negative numbers instead of errors, though.
13:12:12 <jethr0> you seem to dealing with pretty big numberss
13:12:19 <Roboguy> shapr: He doesn't post in it much anymore does he?
13:12:20 <SamB> syntaxfree: went so far right they came back left?
13:12:26 <jethr0> syntaxfree, that's a feature
13:12:41 <franka> Whether one thing is more fundamental than another always depends on how your formalize it.
13:12:42 <syntaxfree> jethr0: here's the plan.
13:12:54 <franka> Just think of utility methods in a class.
13:13:08 <SamB> syntaxfree: you don't like 2's complement numbers of unspecified bitwidth?
13:13:08 <franka> you=your
13:13:24 <syntaxfree> I'm "reversing" the Collatz problem. Later,  I'm gonna flatten the tree, and probe for holes. It's just a way to show the collatz conjecture is valid for numbers up to N.
13:13:32 <shapr> Roboguy: not that I've seen, but I've not looked...
13:13:42 <jethr0> syntaxfree, are you brute-forcing your "proof"?
13:13:50 <syntaxfree> I'm not attempting to prove anything.
13:14:04 <syntaxfree> well, it's a brute-force proof for up to N, I guess.
13:14:11 <jethr0> ah, cool, but "Integer" might be a lot slower than "Int"...
13:14:24 <syntaxfree> what's the limit on Int?
13:14:30 <jethr0> 32bit i guess
13:14:30 <syntaxfree> Provided no negative numbers are used?
13:14:35 <syntaxfree> 2^32.
13:14:38 <syntaxfree> Not good. :~
13:14:52 <jethr0> or rather "signed int" as seen by C maybe
13:15:01 <jethr0> signed long int?
13:15:43 <syntaxfree> unfoldTree yields infinite trees. How do I unfold a tree "up to 10 levels" or something?
13:16:15 <jethr0> what really annoys me is when languages like ruby, perl, python reinvent the wheel and make all the great discoveries about VMs and runtimes that have been known since the 70s...
13:16:16 <syntaxfree> anamorphisms :~
13:16:21 <astrolabe> at least -2^29   to 2^29-1
13:16:23 <jethr0> such a waste of time and effort
13:16:30 <SamB> syntaxfree: prune first?
13:16:41 <syntaxfree> so, how do I go about pruning?
13:16:45 <SamB> jethr0: which are?
13:17:05 <syntaxfree> what's''t'hr 't'r equivalent of "take"?
13:17:16 <syntaxfree> er, what's the tree equivalent of "take"?
13:17:18 <jethr0> the perl6 guys where asked why not use a VM model like schemes, which had solved continuations, tail recursion, etc
13:17:27 <jethr0> but they'd rather do it their own way
13:18:05 <SamB> jethr0: why don't you pop over to #perl6 (our sister channel) and ask how thats coming?
13:18:38 <syntaxfree> ugh. Ugly slide show.
13:18:39 <jethr0> hehe, nah, i don't want to start a flamewar...
13:18:45 <syntaxfree> Guido van Rossum has bulletpoint-itis.
13:18:50 <SamB> jethr0: then just ASK
13:19:08 <jethr0> ok, maybe i will
13:19:10 <SamB> they are friendly with us here
13:19:44 <SamB> any clue as to why that might be?
13:20:01 <syntaxfree> ooh, levels. yes, yes!
13:20:08 <jethr0> you mean pugs?
13:20:15 <SamB> yes, I mean pugs ;-)
13:20:18 <jethr0> samb, did i offend you with my perl6 remarks?
13:20:24 <SamB> not really
13:20:28 <SamB> I don't like parrot either
13:20:29 <franka> I think #haskell-blah is our sister channel.
13:20:40 <SamB> franka: thats more of a side channel
13:20:43 <syntaxfree> #haskell--blah is a sister I don't like.

15:32:56 <dons> so it uses the lightweight curses binding, for one, and i'm half way through porting hide's syn hl to yi now.
15:33:37 <SamB> how is hIDE's syntax highlighting part of hmp3's cool stuff?
15:33:50 <sieni> jethr0: knuth e.g. mentions johnson-trotter: http://www.theory.csc.uvic.ca/~cos/inf/perm/PermInfo.html
15:34:02 <jethr0> sieni, cool
15:34:36 <sieni> and gives also programs for them
15:35:27 <dons> it's not, SamB, the 'and' was a new, only slightly-related sententce ;)
15:35:38 <SamB> hehe
15:35:58 <SamB> not according to english teachers
15:36:08 <sieni> oops, not a knuth page
15:36:27 <dons> it's related in one sense: hmp3's ui gave me the idea for how to do the syn hl cleanly in curses
15:36:38 <SamB> ah ;-)
15:37:14 <dons> 138:54 hmp3 0.2 ;)
15:37:30 <Taral> Today's crazy project: write a PDF parser library in Haskell. :)
15:37:43 <dons> oh, hmm, do we have such a thing already?
15:37:53 <SamB> dons: well, I see that you didn't break the DB with your changes ;-)
15:38:04 <dons> well, that's good.
15:38:05 <SamB> Taral: that'll take longer than a day, methinks
15:38:22 <dons> did you finish the haskell compiler yesterday?
15:38:26 <dons> ;)
15:38:26 <SamB> it will be fairly easy if you don't care about cycles in the resulting data structure, methinks.
15:38:31 <jethr0> taral, cool, what's there to do?
15:38:39 <dons> ah, fun->pdf(since 10/06/2003: via Internet Archive)
15:38:46 <dons>     An implementation of a PDF dynamic writer in Haskell.
15:39:04 <SamB> dons: thats the wrong thing
15:39:08 <SamB> that writes them
15:39:11 <dons> hehe
15:39:16 <lispy> btw, someone locally just helped me figure out why the types are okay in this example
15:39:43 <SamB> lispy: thats amazing ;-)
15:39:53 <SamB> you have people who can understand that locally ;-)
15:40:09 <dons> http://web.archive.org/web/20010708013927/http://www.numeric-quest.com/funpdf/
15:40:10 <lispy> yeah
15:40:21 <lispy> SamB: PhD candidates are useful for something!
15:40:30 <dons> it's a binding to PDFlib.
15:40:32 <SamB> hehe
15:40:42 <SamB> dons: that is so lame
15:40:44 <Heffalump> whereis lispy?
15:40:54 <lispy> oregon state university
15:40:58 * SamB only has parents and sisters
15:41:09 * SamB has no PhD candidates
15:41:17 <Heffalump> where's that? (which city)
15:41:20 <Taral> jethr0: Right now I'm setting out the types I'm going to use for the first cut.
15:41:23 <Heffalump> SamB: well, get one :-)
15:41:29 <lispy> Heffalump: corvallis, can you guess the state ;)
15:41:31 <Taral> dons: No, I didn't finish the compiler. I did finish the lexer, sort of. :)
15:41:32 <SamB> Heffalump: about how much do they cost?
15:41:44 <Heffalump> SamB: hmm, dunno :-)
15:41:44 <SamB> and how much do they eat?
15:41:53 <Heffalump> get your sisters to start PhDs
15:42:03 <SamB> they are younger than I am
15:42:13 <Heffalump> start one yourself
15:42:25 <SamB> I'm still technically a freshman in college
15:42:34 <Heffalump> that's a minor technical detail
15:42:42 <lispy> I may never finish my masters
15:42:44 <SamB> anyway.
15:42:47 <jethr0> taral, couldn't you use libpdf or something?
15:42:57 <SamB> how am *I* supposed to help me understand things?
15:43:05 <lispy> this whole dropping out thing slows the progress towards degree requirments
15:43:06 <Heffalump> human cloning
15:43:22 <SamB> as in "I think I'm a clone now"?
15:43:58 <lispy> heh, weird al rocks
15:44:12 <SamB> now if only I had some of his CDs...
15:44:17 <jethr0> taral, where do you want to parse to?
15:44:18 <SamB> I should add that to my wish list...
15:44:22 <jethr0> s/parse/compile/
15:44:55 <Taral> jethr0: I want to read PDFs, not make them.
15:45:16 <jethr0> "libpdf is an LGPL licensed plain C pdf reading library."
15:45:17 <syntaxfree> John Titor never mentioned human cloning.
15:45:22 <Taral> hm, never heard of it.
15:45:25 <Taral> anyway, it's fun this way.
15:45:33 <SamB> its more fun to write your own, duh!
15:45:38 <syntaxfree> @fact+ libpdf an LGPL licensed plain C pdf reading library.
15:45:39 <lambdabot> I know nothing about libpdf
15:45:48 <syntaxfree> @fact-set libdpf an LGPL licensed plain C pdf reading library.
15:45:49 <lambdabot> Fact recorded.
15:45:58 <SamB> @fact libpdf
15:45:58 <lambdabot> I know nothing about libpdf
15:46:01 <jethr0> so, what do you want to do with the AST after parsing?
15:46:31 <lispy> > nub (map nub (sequence . sequence) [[1,2],[3,4]])
15:46:32 <lambdabot>   The function `map' is applied to three arguments,
15:46:32 <lambdabot>   but its type `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]' has only two
15:46:48 <Taral> jethr0: I want this for adding proper page numbering to a PDF. :)
15:47:03 <jethr0> *aahhh*, seems like kinda overkill. but should be fun
15:47:05 <jethr0> can i help?
15:47:08 <lispy> > nub (map nub ((sequence . sequence) [[1,2],[3,4]]))
15:47:09 <lambdabot> [[1,2],[1,2,4],[1,3,2],[1,3,4],[1,4,2],[1,4,3,2],[1,4,3],[3,1,2],[3,1,2,4]
15:47:09 <lambdabot> ,[3,1,4],[3,4,2],[3,4]]
15:47:09 <Taral> heh
15:47:13 <Taral> not sure what you can do.
15:47:18 <Taral> if I think of anything, I'll tell you. :)
15:47:29 <lispy> jethr0: is that permutations?
15:47:35 <dons> oh, I wish Lemmih would write comments sometimes
15:47:38 <jethr0> lispy, not by a long shot!
15:47:43 <lispy> jethr0: looks like it's missing some terms
15:48:09 <dons> @fact libdpf
15:48:10 <lambdabot> libdpf: an LGPL licensed plain C pdf reading library.
15:48:12 <jethr0> lispy: perms "123" = [123,132,213,231,312,321]
15:48:24 <jethr0> huh?
15:48:35 <lispy> > nub (map nub ((sequence . sequence) [1,2,3]))
15:48:35 <lambdabot>  add an instance declaration for (Num [a])
15:48:35 <lambdabot>   In the list element: 3
15:48:47 <lispy> oh, i sohuld have known that would be the case
15:48:56 <lispy> > nub (map nub ((sequence . sequence) [[1,2,3]]))
15:48:57 <Taral> > nub (map nub ((sequence . sequence) [[1],[2],[3]]))
15:48:57 <lambdabot> [[1,2,3]]
15:48:58 <lambdabot> [[1],[2],[3]]
15:49:00 <Taral> heh
15:49:05 <lispy> heh
15:49:21 <basti_> .o ( ? )
15:49:23 <cakoose> I have a bunch of functions that do IO and might succeed.  What's the best way to combine them?  I think I'm looking for a combination of the IO and Maybe monads.
15:49:49 <jethr0> cakoose, what kind of return value do you want?
15:49:54 * lispy suspects Taral of being a lispy clone
15:50:05 <cakoose> jethr0: hopefully anything
15:50:27 <cakoose> jethr0: I want the functions to return: IO (Maybe a)
15:50:41 <jethr0> cakoose, what do you want as result if the first fails, but the second suceeds?
15:50:59 <jethr0> ah
15:51:06 <cakoose> jethr0: oh...I see.  Let me think
15:51:13 <lispy> > nub [ x <- [1,2,3], y <- [1,2,3]]
15:51:13 <lambdabot>  parse error on input `<-'
15:51:28 <lispy> heh, i should do this in a private chat
15:51:39 <cakoose> jethr0: Wait...that should never happen.  If the first fails, I wouldn't run the second.
15:53:07 <cakoose> jethr0: Actually, right now all my functions are (IO Bool).  I'd be satisfied if I could just get that to work.
15:53:28 <cakoose> Can I write an Monad instance specifically for (IO Bool)?
15:54:19 <jethr0> cakoose, couldn't you do: "let |&&| = liftM2 (&&) in func1 |&&| func2 |&&| func3" or something?
15:54:34 <lispy> @hoogle [a] -> [a]

15:54:35 <lambdabot> Data.List.reverse :: [a] -> [a]
15:55:44 <cakoose> jethr0: Right now I'm just putting them all in a list and passing them to a fold-like function.  I was wondering if there was a way to use the "do" notation.
15:55:57 <Taral> @hoogle Handle -> Int -> IO [a]

15:56:11 <Taral> why doesn't hRead exist?
15:56:27 <Taral> @hoogle Storable a => Handle -> Int -> IO [a]
15:56:28 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
15:56:48 <jethr0> cakoose, i guess if they were "Maybe (IO a)" you could just sequence them...
15:58:08 <dons> Taral, you want a Binary parser?
15:58:25 <dons> get :: Handle -> IO a
15:58:49 <Taral> dons: That might be useful, although I'm mostly doing character IO.
15:58:56 <Taral> I just mixed up a bunch of stuff and got
15:58:57 <Taral> :
15:59:48 <Taral> hRead h n = allocaArray n $ \p -> do { n' <- hGetBuf h p n; peekArray n' p }
16:00:00 <Taral> hWrite h a = withArrayLen a $ \n p -> hPutBuf h p n
16:00:03 <Taral> @pl hWrite h a = withArrayLen a $ \n p -> hPutBuf h p n
16:00:04 <lambdabot> hWrite = flip withArrayLen . flip . hPutBuf
16:00:26 <Taral> @pl hRead h n = allocaArray n $ \p -> hGetBuf h p n >>= \n' -> peekArray n' p
16:00:26 <lambdabot> hRead = ap allocaArray . flip flip (flip peekArray) . (liftM2 (>>=) .) .
16:00:26 <lambdabot> flip . hGetBuf
16:01:02 <Taral> heh
16:03:18 <dons> looks a bit like  hGet,                 -- :: Handle -> Int -> IO FastString
16:03:42 <dons> hPut,                 -- :: Handle -> FastString -> IO ()

16:09:22 <lambdabot> cakoose is in #haskell. Last spoke 13 minutes and 37 seconds ago.
16:09:43 <jethr0> cakoose, "foldl (liftM2 (&&))" works fine!
16:10:47 <jethr0> i guess that's the same as "foldM (&&)"
16:10:55 <jethr0> is it?
16:12:13 <jethr0> well, maybe not
16:19:02 <lightstep> why is megamonad not here any more?
16:21:21 <cakoose> jethr0: neat
16:21:38 <cakoose> jethr0: Wait..does that mean I have to put my actions in a list?
16:22:47 <cakoose> jethr0: I already have a funciton that can handle the list variant (though it's not as concise as the one you've shown me)

16:32:19 <SyntaxNinja> is there an explanation of the various exception types in Haskell?
16:32:33 <Taral> Gs30ng: Your interpreter is probably using a fixed show engine for tuples.
16:32:34 <SyntaxNinja> Gs30ng: tuples can only get so large
16:33:03 <SyntaxNinja> > (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
16:33:04 <lambdabot> (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
16:33:39 <Gs30ng> it's Hugs98 for win32
16:34:02 <SyntaxNinja> do you realy want tuples that big, or are you just curious?
16:34:45 <Gs30ng> i was just testing it, since i'm trying to write a Haskell tutorial in my language
16:34:49 <Gs30ng> Korean.
16:35:03 <SyntaxNinja> cool! have you thought of translating an existng tutorial?
16:35:31 <SyntaxNinja> You should check the report, but I doubt that it's required for haskell implementations to provide a "show" instance for large tuples.
16:35:32 <Gs30ng> i'm referencing some of them
16:35:59 <SyntaxNinja> hugs on linux has the same behavior
16:36:40 <lightstep> i think that the hierarchical libraries contain show instances for large tuples
16:37:27 <Gs30ng> weird. of course i'm not gonna need that big tuples, but theoretically show function must be able to 'show' an infinite tuple
16:37:41 <SyntaxNinja> there are no infinite tuples
16:37:53 <SyntaxNinja> and there's no way to write a general "show" function without something like template haskell.
16:38:03 <Gs30ng> ok then 6-length tuple
16:38:37 <astrolabe> 'Hakell implementations must support tuples up to size 15, together with instances for Eq, Ord, Bounded, Read and Show.'
16:38:40 <SyntaxNinja> implementations have to write explicit instances for each size tuple, so they have to stop somewhere. I guess hugs just stops sooner.
16:39:24 <SyntaxNinja> astrolabe: interesting. so maybe you can import something that'll bring in the instances, as lightstep says.
16:39:31 <SyntaxNinja> astrolabe: does it have to be part of the prelude?
16:39:50 <Gs30ng> you mean they don't do that lazy-eval thing on tuple? only on lists?
16:40:09 <cakoose> It's strange that the constructor exists for 6-tuples but not the Show instance.
16:40:54 <astrolabe> SyntaxNinja: I don't know.  Is it part of the prelude, or part of the language?  My quote is from chapter 6 'Predefined types and classes'
16:41:25 <astrolabe> Gs30ng: they do lazy eval on tuples too I think.
16:42:18 <astrolabe> oh no, it says these types are defined by the prelude
16:42:29 <cakoose> Gs30ng: Tuples are lazily evaluated, but the base structure is a single "object".  Ex: (1,2,3) is a 4 objects, [1,2,3] is 7
16:44:25 <SyntaxNinja> Gs30ng: have you checked the hugs web pages that lists areas where it's not haskell98 compliant? 
16:44:54 <SyntaxNinja> cakoose: "base structure is a single object"? what does that mean?
16:44:59 * araujo wonders why he still doesn't receive the ordered pizza
16:45:20 <cakoose> SyntaxNinja: it's a single peice of data
16:45:34 <cakoose> SyntaxNinja: Unlike a list which is a bunch of linked pieces of data
16:45:57 <SyntaxNinja> so you mean, like, 4 thunks or something?
16:46:07 <cakoose> SyntaxNinja: that's what I was getting at

18:27:33 <ulfdoz_> that is probably related with time of day.

18:27:57 <araujo> night ulfdoz_ 
18:28:54 * musasabi throws some barbed lambdas into araujos direction ;)
18:29:05 <musasabi> oh and evening too.
18:29:26 <araujo> I am not alone!
18:29:31 <araujo> evening musasabi 
18:32:50 <benny> how can i extract an IO value inside ghci?
18:33:30 <sebell> I would talk but I can't type because I'm learning dvorak
18:34:36 <sebell> Just pretend that I've got 1m lag :)
18:35:13 <benny> :type a
18:35:20 <benny> a :: IO (Maybe Int)
18:35:29 <benny> how can i see what the value of a is?
18:38:10 <Korollar1> benny: IO is a one way monad, so you cannot safely take the value out.
18:38:12 <musasabi> benny: you can use print
18:38:26 <musasabi> i.e. print =<< myComputation
18:38:52 <musasabi> or you can do stuff like: "val <- myComputation" and then use val.
18:39:45 <benny> excellent. thank you sir
18:53:32 <araujo> @index isJust
18:53:33 <lambdabot> Data.Maybe
19:00:57 <user317> why would someone use . instead of $ or vice versa
19:02:50 <musasabi> because they fit into different places
19:03:32 <musasabi> usually one uses $ for function applications and . for composing functions.
19:03:45 <user317> but you could compose functions with $
19:04:25 <user317> at least thats what i understand from the tutorial
19:05:53 <musasabi> you can do that, but it makes sense in different context (and is usually just partial application)
19:07:00 <musasabi> btw both of them are simple functions.
19:08:09 <musasabi> "f $ g = f g" and "(.) f g x = f (g x)"
19:09:38 <user317> couldn't you define (.) f g = f g as well?
19:10:55 <musasabi> @type (let o f g x = f (g x) in o)
19:10:56 <lambdabot> forall t t1 t2. (t -> t1) -> (t2 -> t) -> t2 -> t1
19:11:04 <musasabi> @type (let o f g = f g in o)
19:11:05 <lambdabot> forall t t1. (t -> t1) -> t -> t1
19:11:41 <musasabi> (in short, no)
19:16:12 <user317> but when you call f . g x and f $ g x you get the same result, and it does the exact same thing
19:18:39 <musasabi> user317: no.
19:19:11 <musasabi> "(f . g) x" and "f $ g x" are the same.
19:19:47 <musasabi> "f . g" is the same as "\x -> f $ g x"
19:19:49 <user317> musasabi: sorry thats what i meant, so why would you use one or the other?
19:28:18 <m3ga> join #edevelop
19:40:09 <Korollary> 3..2...1...
19:41:59 <araujo> ?
19:42:53 <Korollary> cmeme's joining and quitting pattern
19:43:11 <araujo> Is that a bot?
19:43:44 <user317> maybe its a bad wireless connection
19:46:31 <Cale> user317: you'd use one or the other when emphasizing either the functions or the points they act on
19:46:46 <Cale> Use of composition emphasises working with the functions
19:47:04 <Cale> It also lets you eliminate the 'x' entirely in many cases
19:47:08 <user317> so is it pure syntactical sugar?
19:47:17 <Cale> no, it's not even that
19:47:22 <Cale> it's just some defined functions
19:47:30 <Cale> (.) and ($) are defined in the Prelude
19:47:38 <araujo> @index (.)
19:47:38 <lambdabot> Prelude
19:47:42 <user317> but you can compose funcitons with $ just as easily as with .
19:47:45 <Cale> no
19:47:46 <user317> and using less () 
19:47:47 <Cale> you can't
19:47:57 <araujo> @type (.)
19:47:58 <lambdabot> forall c a b. (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
19:48:02 <araujo> @type ($)
19:48:03 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> a -> b
19:48:04 <Cale> well, you can use lambda
19:48:17 <Cale> (f . g) = \x -> f $ g x
19:48:27 <Cale> but f . g is a lot nicer
19:48:44 <Cale> in a lot of cases, anyway
19:48:49 <user317> so what is f $ g then?
19:48:58 <Cale> the function f applied to the value g
19:49:08 <Cale> same as f g
19:49:16 <Cale> not the same as f . g
19:49:33 <Cale> @type ($)
19:49:34 <lambdabot> forall b a. (a -> b) -> a -> b
19:49:39 <Cale> @type (.)
19:49:40 <lambdabot> forall c a b. (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
19:50:13 <Cale> > filter (not . null) [[1,2],[],[],[3],[4,5,6]]
19:50:14 <lambdabot> [[1,2],[3],[4,5,6]]
19:51:10 <Cale> > let mymap f = foldr ((:) . f) [] in mymap (+7) [1,2,3,4,5]
19:51:11 <lambdabot> [8,9,10,11,12]
19:51:45 <Cale> when you're thinking about functions, (.) is the way to go, and makes things clearer
19:52:04 <Cale> when you're thinking about values, ($) is what you want
19:52:13 <user317> h = f $ g wont compile?
19:52:29 <Cale> if f doesn't take a function as its first parameter, no
19:52:31 <user317> lets say g x = x and f x = putStrLn x
19:52:37 <Cale> then no
19:53:18 <user317> i see
19:53:21 <user317> i get it
19:57:02 <user317> Cale: thanks, that makes perfect sense now
19:57:07 <xah> are there more scheme libraries or haskell?
20:00:18 <Cale> xah: scheme libraries?
20:00:26 <xah> Cale: yeah
20:00:47 <Korollary> just numbers won't do justice I am afraid.
20:01:06 <Cale> uh, like a Scheme interpreter in Haskell?
20:01:21 <xah> i wanted to get a fee of which is more practical as of now
20:01:38 <twb> xah: Haskell has better libraries.
20:01:55 <Cale> oh
20:01:59 <Cale> *or* Haskell
20:02:01 <xah> "better"??
20:02:07 <Cale> I thought you said *in* Haskell
20:02:09 <Cale> hehe
20:02:23 <xah> i just want a honest real answer, from people who had experience programing in both
20:02:28 <Cale> Hmm...
20:02:36 <xah> not interested in tech geeker dog fights and sensitivity
20:02:54 <Korollary> xah: I haven't done any serious Scheme, but neither are considered practical by industry standards.
20:02:55 <twb> For a given feature, there is probably a Scheme implementation that does it better than Haskell.  But I can't think of a *single* Scheme implementation that is better overall than ghc for real-world programming.
20:03:23 <Cale> I think Haskell at the very least is distributed with a more useful set of libraries than most scheme implementations I've seen
20:03:34 <Cale> but I haven't done a lot of scheme programming, so it's hard for me to say
20:03:35 <xah> twb: what kind of things are you speaking of? i.e. what kind of tasks, or modules?
20:03:59 <twb> xah: things like FFI, parsing, testing.
20:04:06 <xah> ,FFI
20:04:17 <xah> i want fsbot
20:04:24 <Cale> Haskell has some very high quality parsing libraries which for the most part seem unmatched
20:04:33 <Cale> Parsec is incredibly nice to use
20:04:34 <xah> FFI??
20:04:41 <Korollary> also, I don't really see Scheme getting any more popular after so many decades.
20:04:43 <twb> FFI is foreign function interface.
20:04:52 * araujo throws some lambda of fires at cmeme 
20:04:54 <Cale> FFI in Haskell is quite decent
20:05:22 <Cale> Far from 100% automatic, but all the tools you'll need are there, and it's easy to import and export C functions.
20:05:27 <xah> mmm... i see.
20:05:29 <twb> I think for the CS community in general, Haskell is currently more popular than Scheme.
20:05:58 <tautologico> can anyone help me with parsec?
20:06:04 <Cale> tautologico: sure
20:06:20 <Cale> for testing, I've seen some neat tools in both scheme and Haskell
20:06:31 <xah> the 2 or so comments in the scheme room seems to think scheme has more libs
20:06:37 <twb> tautologico: have you read the manual?
20:06:42 <tautologico> yep
20:06:48 <Cale> Haskell has quickcheck, which is a library for automatically generating random test cases to test properties
20:07:03 <tautologico> the problem is: I'm using buildExpressionParser and so far so good
20:07:14 <xah> yah i'm quite pissed at the schemeing academic heads,
20:07:23 <twb> xah: but the libraries aren't portable between Scheme implementations, so you have to choose an implementation very carefully before you start writing.
20:07:33 <tautologico> but I need a default operator... something like x y means x * y
20:07:36 <xah> back in 1997, Perl, Scheme, Tcl, and even Python are all on the horizon,
20:07:48 <tautologico> I've tried some things, to no avail
20:07:54 <Korollary> in 1997, Scheme was already too old to be on the horizon.
20:07:59 <Cale> tautologico: hmm
20:08:14 <xah> and today, 2005, Perl, Python, and even Ruby are everywhere... 
20:08:20 <xah> and Scheme is no where to be seen.
20:08:32 <twb> Because Scheme is not taught in schools.
20:08:42 <Korollary> xah: People just won't write in Scheme, for bad reasons as well.
20:08:46 <Cale> twb: afaik, Ruby isn't either
20:08:48 <twb> For the same reason that FP scares people, Sexprs scare people.
20:08:57 <xah> and remain in their bottled up ivory tower
20:09:19 <twb> Cale: but the leap from Java to Python is a lot smaller.
20:09:22 <Korollary> xah: Scientists are to discover knowledge, not to fix the software industry.
20:09:25 <Cale> xah: I have little experience with the scheme community -- how does it compare with Haskell's?
20:09:27 <twb> Cale: but the leap from Java to Ruby is a lot smaller, that is.
20:09:36 <Cale> twb: yes
20:09:50 <Korollary> does it even take a 'leap' ?
20:09:52 <twb> Cale: IME, Schemers are primarily interested in language research and design.
20:10:27 <Cale> In Haskell, we have quite a bit of language design research people, but there are also lots of practical people who just want to get work done
20:10:41 <xah> Cale: that is great!
20:10:45 <xah> i hate academics
20:10:51 <Cale> I sort of like the balance it makes
20:10:58 <twb> xah: yeah.  Who needs knowledge, anyway?
20:11:00 <Korollary> xah: don't hate anyone. You're not paying them for anything.
20:11:09 <xah> they do "research" in name, but often their "research" is self-deluding fantasy
20:11:23 <Cale> xah: well, sometimes it turns into useful things
20:11:26 <twb> That is the nature of research.
20:11:37 <Cale> xah: The use of monads in Haskell for example
20:11:42 <xah> Korollary: hate is a english expression, a human animals's expression, a deep and eternal one
20:11:50 <tautologico> if it weren't for research you would be using what, Fortran ?
20:11:51 <twb> You don't know when you start R&D that you're going to get 1000% ROI or 2%.
20:12:03 <Cale> monads can be put to incredibly practical use
20:12:11 <user317> xah: and most of gets used after the person is dead anyways
20:12:31 <twb> I will say that IO is (at least relatively) incredibly confusing for a new Haskeller.
20:12:35 <Cale> but if it weren't for algebraic topologists, category theorists, and language formalists, we wouldn't be able to put them to good use
20:12:36 <dons> yay! only 1 year late: syntax highlighting in ncurses yi: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/images/yi-color.png
20:12:36 <xah> Research per se of course is all important, very important, those fundamental sciences... but what i'm saying, is that academics in general are doing shitless research their ass.
20:12:58 <Cale> twb: it's only that the explanations in many places are bad
20:13:02 <Korollary> dons: karma +++++
20:13:12 <user317> xah: but you never know whats shitless and what isn't, who would have thought that rice's thereom would be usefull when he came up with it
20:13:15 <Cale> dons: awesome!
20:13:33 <Cale> dons: what does it use to do the parsing?
20:13:37 <twb> Cale: no, I mean it's confusing trying to mix functions that do I/O with functions that don't.
20:14:08 <Cale> twb: I know -- and it's because this isn't explained well enough in many places
20:14:08 <dons> it's using the standalone lexer used in hIDE
20:14:19 <dons> and the colorizing code for curses, from hmp3
20:14:22 <twb> Cale: I suppose you could be right
20:14:22 <Cale> :)
20:14:23 <Korollary> dons: How does haskell indenting work in yi-ncurses?
20:14:43 <xah> user317: i'm not talking about the need of basic research that has forseable use, nor am i debating what constitutes basic research, or what might turn out to be extremely important. I AM talking about the academics, as of today, that their research projects or what not are shit.
20:14:47 <dons> it doesn't :)
20:15:00 <xah> forseeable -> unforeseeable 
20:15:10 <Cale> xah: I wouldn't make such a general statement about the current work
20:15:21 <Cale> xah: there's some really neat work going on actually
20:15:29 <Korollary> dons: hey, at least it's honest about it. caml-mode drives me bonkers in emacs.
20:15:54 <xah> the academicians in general, in USA, and probably elsewhere, are self-deluded heads.
20:16:21 <Cale> xah: what do you think of, say, Simon Peyton-Jones' work?
20:16:21 <twb> BTW, since xah is probably new to #haskell: http://www.xahlee.org/Netiquette_dir/troll.html
20:16:27 <xah> with their tenure.
20:16:34 <dons> Korollary, the theory is to use a pretty printer to do indenting
20:16:40 <user317> xah: i would have to disagree, just given the human progress in the past 20 years, the sheer amount of usefull research in just about every field outweighs all the research that you may deem useless
20:16:41 <dons> based on the abstract syntax
20:17:06 <Korollary> dons: oscar worthy
20:17:24 <twb> dons: btw, have you read Finseth's book?
20:17:26 <Cale> xah: check out this paper and tell us what you think :) http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/stm/index.htm
20:17:33 <dons> twb, nope, which book?
20:17:43 <twb> @google Craig Finseth 
20:17:44 <lambdabot> http://www.finseth.com/~fin/
20:18:12 <twb> dons: lemme just find it...
20:19:33 <twb> dons: http://www.finseth.com/craft/
20:20:07 <twb> dons: it describes various design ideas from the Emacs school of editors.
20:20:36 <Cale> xah: honestly, read that -- at the same time, you'll be reading about one of the libraries which was more recently added to GHC, and which you can play with today.
20:20:38 <xah> user317 and others: get out of tech geeking mode. I'm not talking debating the usefulness of pure research. I'm making a comment about academics as they are today. And, it's not about one particular person, it is about the whole academicia, the results and efficiency of their research, in the contexts of say, in different eras, or, compare their results to  researches done by private companies. 
20:22:18 <xah> just because a person have read a book or two about the importance of pure research that has no forseeable applicability, does not mean everytime a related topic comes up one needs to jump up and speak about how so gravely important pure research is.
20:22:25 <xah> that's very typical of tech geekers.
20:23:09 <Cale> um, but you're the one who said that it was all worthless. Perhaps try speaking without using so many absolutes.
20:23:28 <Cale> Sure, there's probably some work out there which is not going anywhere
20:23:51 <xah> i'm claiming the current batch of academics in general, are wusses.
20:23:55 <Cale> but we're trying to say that there is a lot of work out there that has a direct impact on practical applications
20:24:05 <Cale> what do you think they should be doing?
20:24:09 <user317> xah: but who in specific?
20:24:10 <xah> Cale: yes, but let me explain...
20:24:26 <Cale> I think that there are many academics who aren't
20:25:03 <Cale> Quite a few for whom it's not just about getting papers accepted, but actually making things which work.
20:25:24 <xah> oh well anyway i didn't want to make a big argument... :) hehe... let's go back to some tech topic. :D
20:25:57 <xah> the tenure system in academica should be done away with.
20:26:08 <xah> and edu system should privatize.
20:26:19 <Cale> hmm... I'm not sure I agree with that.
20:26:21 <xah> pure fire and burn the academicians's asses.
20:26:26 <xah> pure -> put.
20:26:29 <Cale> I'd actually rather it be more public
20:26:54 <Cale> since it's important that as a society, education is available to everyone who wants it
20:27:05 <Cale> er
20:27:09 <user317> id rather have private companies not use artificial barriers to block competition
20:27:12 <Cale> since it's important that as a society, we make education available to everyone who wants it
20:27:27 <twb> dons: also you may be interested in http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanb/software/mg/, a small clone of Emacs that weighs in at 145kB.
20:28:19 <Cale> If it becomes privatized, you're likely to lose a lot of the guarantees.
20:28:27 <Cale> Already, people have problems
20:28:34 <user317> although i agree, the private sector is more efficient
20:28:42 <Cale> (with finances and so on)
20:28:55 <xah> Cale: sure, we all want free edu. But things has costs. Things are never free. Basic economics.
20:28:59 <user317> thats why many countries, like the US allow public funded researchers apply for patents
20:29:21 <xah> Cale: there's no free lunch.
20:29:24 <binary42_> Cale: I am not sure I can agree. Public education in an ideal but not really a reality. People don't function the same and that will always put real work at a disadvantage.
20:29:29 <Cale> xah: yes, and I'm saying that we, as a society, should pay for education with taxes
20:29:52 <xah> Cale: ah, but communism on the whole failed around the world.
20:29:52 <twb> Cale: we had that in .au two generations ago.
20:30:00 <twb> Cale: then they phased it out.
20:30:06 <Cale> I'm not talking about communism
20:30:09 <xah> http://www.xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/commies.html
20:30:15 <Cale> I'm talking about social services
20:30:20 <xah> Cale: well, but your ideals are like it.
20:30:24 <Cale> no
20:30:29 <Cale> you're generalising again
20:30:32 <xah> Cale: yeah, communism is about social services.
20:30:40 <xah> Cale: it's in the same ball park.
20:30:42 <Cale> Yes, but it's more than that
20:30:46 <user317> xah: paying for education is not communism, you get more people starting buisnesses if they know that if they completely fuck up the society will at least pay for food and shelter and basic education for their family, overall that leads to a bigger private sector
20:31:06 <binary42_> communism is a topic that should be avoided unless people are willing to learn what it is rather than take preconceptions they had while growing up.
20:31:14 <twb> BTW, since xah is probably new to #haskell: http://www.xahlee.org/Netiquette_dir/troll.html
20:31:25 <Cale> twb: everyone's aware of xah :)
20:31:39 <binary42_> public does not mean government has to be involved either.
20:31:41 <xah> twb: yeah you already posted that link.
20:31:48 <xah> twb: try another link. 
20:32:10 <twb> Cale: just making sure :-)
20:32:28 <Cale> xah: by the way, you'd probably have less trouble with people disagreeing with you and calling you a troll if you didn't make rash assumptions about what someone is saying
20:32:40 * twb wanders off to reorganize his FLAC collection...
20:32:53 * Korollary strips off replaygain data from twb's flacs
20:32:59 <Cale> Korollary: hehe
20:33:09 <tautologico> actually here in Brazil public universities are better than the ones from the private sector, especially with regards to research... public unis produce far more research than private ones
20:34:17 <tautologico> however, funding for these unis is dwindling, and many top-quality departments are only surviving through partnership with private companies
20:35:03 <Cale> I think that the private vs. public issue isn't really the problem as far as producing good research. Nor is it really tenure -- people will do a lot of hard work for rewards like tenure. It's really about bringing the right kinds of people together on projects.
20:35:17 <xah> i think another important thing about academicians is that with their ph Ds and research and tenure, they have a extremely bloated ego. Their assessment of their own knowledge makes them think they know everything, and makes the world EXTREMELY dangerous. They are blind, so to speak. 
20:35:45 <xah> it is even arguable, that there shouldn't be any research at all! 
20:36:04 <binary42_> xah: and those that don't assume that those that do always are (in generic terms).
20:36:20 <xah> look at today, with all these technology, yet Bush is killing some 40 thousand people.
20:36:31 <Korollary> http://cvs.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki
20:36:33 <Cale> xah: I haven't found that at all. Many of the people I know with Ph.D's are extremely modest, given what they actually do know.
20:36:38 <xah> and Africa are dying of hunger.
20:36:51 <user317> xah: with the fall of the soviet union thanks to bushlike ragen the number of wars and death from war dropped by 15%
20:36:53 <xah> Cale: look at this not from personal point of view,
20:36:56 <Cale> xah: that's another topic altogether
20:37:03 <xah> but from the whole society and history. Statistics, trends.
20:37:30 <Cale> xah: how do you measure modesty/conceit?
20:37:35 <Korollary> Cale: I know a relevant quote: It's the smart ones who say "I don't know." the most because they don't feel the need to sound smart.
20:37:48 <xah> Futuristic Calamity
20:37:51 <Cale> Korollary: yes :)
20:37:53 <xah> http://www.xahlee.org/Periodic_dosage_dir/20030909calamity.html
20:38:34 <Cale> xah: I mean - do you measure it with surveys? We're talking about the present. You mentioned statistics in the context of modesty.
20:39:21 <xah> Cale: what i'm saying, is the general behavior from the academic sector.
20:39:27 <xah> ,
20:39:42 <xah> you can judge a country's people by the country's history,
20:39:42 <Cale> I'm saying that I don't see the behaviour that you claim to be seeing.
20:39:52 <xah> how it interacted with others. Likewise,
20:40:10 <xah> you can just a sector of people (teens, lawers, businessmen, computer programers...etc),
20:40:25 <Cale> Maybe very recent history.
20:40:27 <xah> by looking at the statistics, population survey,
20:40:29 <xah> demographics,
20:40:36 <xah> of their choices, behaviors, and things.
20:40:50 <Cale> But you don't really want to judge the group as a whole.
20:41:11 <Cale> That's asking the wrong question altogether, in my mind.
20:41:12 <xah> i want to judge the group as the whole. Because,
20:41:26 <xah> the context is humanity, society.
20:41:31 <xah> not some moral debate.
20:41:48 <dons> twb, yes, i already use mg. i wrote the mg emulation mode for yi :)
20:43:28 <Cale> If you see things happening that are wrong, those are events (and I don't see any examples here, but I'm willing to accept that they occur for the purposes of debate). You don't go and generalise those events to an entire population without taking extreme caution.
20:44:32 <Cale> If there are problematic events, restrict your view to those who are actually taking actions which are causing those events to occur.
20:44:41 <Cale> Not some general classification that they happen to belong to.
20:45:39 <Cale> I mean, by the same reasoning, you could basically argue that all human life is completely worthless, and we should all commit suicide right now for fear of anything bad ever happening ever again.
20:46:46 <Cale> If you're actually interested in knowing something general, it's got to be more involved than a case study.
20:47:10 <Cale> Am I making sense?
20:47:48 <lispy> Cale: what was the category theory book you recommend for haskellers?
20:48:02 <lispy> Cale: or any other math books you recommend
20:48:12 * lispy is making a christmas list
20:48:22 <Cale> lispy: I'm not sure I picked one out, but Toposes, Triples and Theories has a nice opening with clear definitions in it
20:48:23 * xah_ modestly step off the soapbox. :)
20:48:58 <Cale> lispy: "Calculus" by Michael Spivak is a wonderful book for a beginning student of mathematics
20:49:27 <tautologico> I like basic category theory for computer scientists
20:49:38 <Cale> anyone who wants to study mathematics wouldn't be too far off the mark by starting with Spivak's text :)
20:49:43 <lispy> Cale: ah, i have a BS in math so i'm not sure if  the spivak book would be worth it :)
20:49:46 * xah_ sorry i went off into a screed
20:49:47 <Cale> ah, okay
20:49:49 <Korollary> Heh. SPJ's posts don't appear correctly in the thread because Exchange uses a proprietary field...
20:50:18 <Cale> hmm... other good math texts :)
20:50:49 <tautologico> well then, Category Theory for the Working Mathematician :)
20:50:54 <Cale> tautologico: yes
20:51:01 <Cale> I was just about to mention that
20:51:31 <tautologico> oops
20:51:31 <lispy> thanks
20:51:39 <Cale> I have a scanned copy if you want to have a look, but it's not of comfortable reading quality
20:51:43 <tautologico> Categories for the Working Mathematician, Saunders MacLane
20:51:49 <Cale> yes
20:51:55 <tautologico> not "Category Theory"
20:51:57 <tautologico> very good book
20:52:03 <Cale> MacLane was one of the founders of CT
20:52:10 <Cale> so it really ought to be good
20:52:31 <lispy> Cale: i have no problem with a book being rigorous
20:52:37 <Korollary> Cale: Have you employed significant CT in design of your programs?
20:52:45 <lispy> only if it's full of holes and mistakes
20:53:19 <Cale> Korollary: well, hmm... only in the sense that most Haskell programmers do :)
20:53:29 <Cale> maybe a little more than that
20:53:44 <Cale> It's a nice abstract perspective though
20:53:50 <Korollary> Cale: Of course
20:53:56 <Cale> and it's also hard to quantify how much I've used it
20:54:01 <Cale> just in thinking
20:54:06 <dbremner> Cale - have you read Categories for Software Engineering?
20:54:19 <Cale> dbremner: no, is that obtainable somewhere?
20:54:36 <Cale> or is it dead trees? :)
20:54:46 <dbremner> Cale - it's dead trees.
20:55:26 <Cale> If one enjoys somewhat esoteric but fun graph theory, "Algebraic Graph Theory" by Godsil and Royle is a neat book.
20:55:57 <Cale> Went well with the course I had with Godsil :)
20:56:37 <tautologico> esoteric, hm...
20:56:40 <lispy> heh
20:56:51 <tautologico> Categories for Types by Roy Crole, maybe?
20:57:15 <Cale> It's a nice complement to the usual algebraic structures one tends to see in an undergraduate mathematics program, as you get to see all the things about homomorphisms, kernels, etc. in a new light
20:57:17 <lispy> hmm..i need to get a copy of a good calc for engineers type book
20:57:31 <Korollary> Has anyone here studied TaPL chapter by chapter, solving exercises, etc. ?
20:57:39 <Cale> lispy: why calc for engineers?
20:57:46 <dbremner> there's also Conceptual Mathematics.
20:57:55 <Cale> I'd like to get hold of TaPL
20:58:00 <lispy> Cale: well, i have pure math books on calc, but sometimes it's nice to have a more pratical reference
20:58:08 <lispy> TaPL?
20:58:10 <tautologico> Korollary, most of the chapter, but not all exercises
20:58:16 <tautologico> *chapters
20:58:23 <Cale> http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/
20:58:35 <Korollary> tautologico: self study or in school?
20:58:39 <lispy> ah, i have that book
20:58:55 <tautologico> I found the chapter about type reconstruction confusing (after reading the same subject in a number of places and papers)
20:58:57 <lispy> i needed for a course and we never did a single read or assignment from it
20:59:16 <lispy> i should make a habit of reading it
20:59:25 <tautologico> Korollary, self study, but it's somewhat important for my thesis
21:00:04 <Korollary> tautologico: How many weeks did it take you? I'm guessing I can't do it under 20 weeks, 4 hours/week. Am I in the neighborhood with that guess?
21:00:43 <tautologico> I took maybe longer than that, because I studied a chapter and then stopped to care for more pressing things, then returned
21:01:04 <lispy> this book looks fun: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486428753/qid=1134190599/ref=br_lf_b_9/002-3291574-5178452?n=13905&s=books&v=glance
21:01:12 <tautologico> but there's a lot there, to be sure... many things I can't claim to understand well
21:02:40 <tautologico> the first chapters are a breeze if you're already familiar with lambda calculus and untyped and simple typed 
21:02:53 <Cale> "Visual Complex Analysis" is supposed to be quite good
21:03:02 <tautologico> I meant, "lambda calculus, untyped and simple typed"
21:03:11 <Cale> http://www.usfca.edu/vca/
21:04:18 <Korollary> tautologico: I am familiar with LC only on the surface. I may quit in the middle and not finish the book, but I intend to eat several chapters. Thanks.
21:06:04 * Korollary realizes that he just lives a few blocks from the Seattle public library...
21:06:18 <xah_> here's my recommendations: http://www.xahlee.org/PBooks_dir/mathBooks.html
21:06:22 <tautologico> Korollary, then the first chapters will be a good read, because they explain LC very well (IMHO, of course)
21:09:19 <lispy> xah_: thanks
21:10:35 <xah_> lispy: are you a student? professor?
21:10:57 <lispy> xah_: i'm a masters student in CS
21:10:57 <xah_> lispy: didn't catch the whole drift
21:11:03 <xah_> ah..
21:11:22 <lispy> im making a christmas list because people keep asking me what i want :)
21:11:23 <xah_> lispy: and you are looking for a particular book?
21:11:30 <xah_> lispy: lol.
21:11:53 <lispy> right now i'm looking for a book that describes how to design computer hardware
21:12:10 <lispy> i've seen a really good one, but i can't think of what the title was
21:12:36 <lispy> something that starts with digital logic and then gets into ALU design and discusses that sort of thing
21:12:41 <xah_> lispy: what's your field of study?
21:12:45 <lispy> well...
21:13:03 <lispy> i'm a software/math person, but as a hobby i've been wanting to construct a very simple computer
21:13:36 <lispy> as as undergrad i took some courses in digital logic and computer architecture, but i don't remember it well enough to just build something
21:13:48 <Korollary> lispy: You can't just build it anyway.
21:14:37 <lispy> Korollary: have you seen http://www.homebrewcpu.com/
21:14:54 <Korollary> lispy: Yes, I have.
21:15:14 <tautologico> lispy: maybe this one http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/026214087X/ref=wl_it_dp/103-3047549-9265411?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I2QI57ZUB54IA6&v=glance&colid=1VJT4SC4TORX4
21:15:18 <Korollary> lispy: It's a large scale lab exercise heh.
21:17:18 <lispy> tautologico: cool
21:17:26 <Korollary> lispy: if you're serious about it, your best bet is using an FPGA. You can get something pretty simple and pretty cheap.
21:18:01 <xah_> lispy: cool. you are in US?
21:18:15 <lispy> Korollary: yeah, i had an FPGA on my list last year :)
21:18:20 <lispy> xah_: yes
21:25:28 <tautologico> parsec rules... now I just need to find how to parse a default operator
21:29:59 <twb> dons: so (when) will Yi get a dired mode?
21:31:38 <mwc> Hey, does anybody know of a nice set of 'visualization' kits for Haskell? I'm looking for some nice way of outputting data to gnuplot; graphviz, or something similar
21:32:02 <twb> mwc: what type of data?
21:33:13 <mwc> twb, anything from numerical arrays to graphs
21:33:25 <mwc> I'm looking for some sort of haskell answer to visual python
21:34:05 <twb> mwc: I'm not familiar with that package.  URL?
21:34:25 <mwc> http://vpython.org/VisualOverview.html
21:36:59 <twb> "David Scherer created a 3D graphics module for Python, called "Visual," that is exceptionally easy to use. A program can create 3D objects (such as spheres, curves, etc.) and position them in 3D space."
21:37:10 <twb> mwc: that doesn't sound like what you described.
21:37:27 <Cale> mwc: http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~kahl/Haskell/Dot.lhs for a simple interface to dot
21:37:57 <twb> mwc: that paragraph sounds like you want something like the OpenGL bindings...
21:40:49 <Taral> @pl ((f s):ss)
21:40:50 <lambdabot> f s : ss
21:42:06 <mwc> twb, nah, well, mostly I want some sort of package for quick and dirty visualization
21:42:53 <twb> mwc: 2d or 3d?
21:43:32 <twb> mwc: arbitrary geometric shapes, or graphics graphs or gnuplot plots?
21:43:46 <mwc> Cale, that looks promising
21:44:14 <mwc> twb, nah, more like if I have an array of triples of numbers, I can get a 3D scatter plot
21:44:25 <mwc> if I have a graph, I can dump it to graphviz
21:46:20 <xah_> twb: you've used visual python?
21:46:27 <twb> xah_: no.
21:47:36 <twb> I find Python pays lip service to core features that Perl actually implements, so I generally end up using the latter for scripts that sh(1) can't cope with.
21:50:58 <Korollary> features like what?
21:51:33 <twb> closures.
21:51:36 <Korollary> ugh
21:52:02 <Korollary> scripts that sh can't cope with require closures?
21:52:06 <twb> I also have a prejudice against object systems.
21:53:36 <xah_> twb: i'm totally turned off by Python these days
21:54:01 <xah_> in the beginning of the year, i start to learn python, because i've been wanted to learn it for years, to "practice what i preach",
21:54:13 <xah_> but over this year, the whole experience turned sour.
21:54:14 <twb> o_O
21:54:17 <Roboguy> Have you looked at Boo?
21:54:26 <twb> xah_: You didn't even *KNOW* Python before?
21:54:27 <xah_> python's got the worse document there is.
21:54:31 <xah_> no.
21:54:45 <mwc> xah_, hahaha, I have the exact same experience
21:54:47 <Korollary> There's nothing interesting about Python per se. But there's not much blatantly wrong about it either.
21:54:54 <user317> have you guys checked out nemerle
21:54:56 <xah_> and the language, although didn't start as a hack and don't wallow in hacking as perl & unix do, but isn't that much better at all.
21:55:18 <mwc> "Python would be a nice language to learn, very practical." by page 13 I'm thinking "man, this is so inconsistent. It's just BASIC with good press.
21:55:30 <xah_> in fact when it comes to functional style, python sucks big time. Perl beats it.
21:55:30 <twb> Korollary: I remembered another thing I don't like about it -- the lack of functional core.
21:55:39 <mwc> user317, Nemerle is like C# with ML, isn't it?
21:55:44 <user317> ruby is pretty nice for a scripting dynamically typed language
21:55:46 <user317> mwc: yea
21:55:47 <twb> Korollary: Common Lisp may not be purely functional, but it encourages a functional style.
21:55:50 <Korollary> twb: No such thing was promised.
21:56:19 <jethr0> twb, i'm not so sure about the "encourages"...
21:56:40 <user317> mwc: i've had a lot of good experiences with it, they have a nice set of functional data structures
21:57:14 <mwc> user317, yeah, I'm kinda put off by it being on the CLI
21:57:26 <user317> mwc: runs great on mono
21:57:29 <wolverian> user317, ruby is neat, except it doesn't support unicode. ARGH.
21:57:33 <mwc> Mono is still dicey on a lot of platforms
21:57:40 <user317> wolverian: yea, thats my biggest gripe with it
21:57:41 <mwc> wolverian, that's coming soon, I hear
21:57:41 <jethr0> lisp is an interesting language. but you would be hard pressed to write a purely functional program in it
21:57:44 <xah_> wolverian: ruby dosen't do unicode?
21:57:47 <wolverian> xah_, nope.
21:57:53 <wolverian> mwc, I hope so, it's a nice language.
21:57:56 <twb> jethr0: rubbish.
21:57:57 <user317> xah_: nope, it think 2.0 will though
21:57:58 <Roboguy> jethr0: Which Lisp? Common Lisp/
21:58:02 <xah_> does it support at least processing unicode strings?
21:58:10 <user317> xah_: and they promised a bytecode compiler as well
21:58:11 <wolverian> (although it'll never beat perl6 .. at least if we can get it out before ruby2 ;)
21:58:17 <twb> jethr0: unless you consider normal-order evaluation a requirement for pure functionality.
21:59:02 <xah_> i think that in general, language authors should be treated as criminals to begin with, unless they outstandingly proven otherwise. (same with politicians)
21:59:06 <jethr0> twb, no. but even apart from IO, CLisp has just been developped to be used with the occasional side effect in mind
21:59:17 <mwc> Perl 6 looks exciting. Has it stablelized yet, or is it still subject to arbitrary revision
21:59:23 <user317> xah_: hehe, i think every CS enthusiast needs to write one
21:59:24 <twb> jethr0: I disagree.
21:59:53 <wolverian> mwc, it's halfway there.
22:00:14 <jethr0> twb, hmm, ok... let me see whether i can come up with an example...
22:00:15 <wolverian> mwc, as in, it won't suddenly become python3, but it will still change.
22:00:31 <user317> mwc: whats great about nemerle is you can basically code completely functional language and use all the .net api when you need to do real work :)
22:00:33 <mwc> yeah
22:00:57 <mwc> user317, basically, my gripe is that the .net api is too platform limited right now. Then there's memory use
22:01:35 <user317> mwc: once apple goes to x86 mono will run on osx as well, thats about all of the important ones
22:01:36 <mwc> Tried to run Mono on OpenBSD or OS X recently? :P
22:01:48 <jethr0> twb, bad example, but the whole idea of call/cc in based on "set".
22:01:49 <mwc> it runs on mac os x now
22:01:55 <xah_> user317: i think that generally people have respect for language inventors, because it seems something difficult. But to be fair, technically it is downright easy, any idiot can invent a languages. The more significant thing about language creation, is of a political or entrepreneurship, not technical know-how.
22:01:57 <mwc> the CPU doesn't matter, it has a JIT compiler
22:01:57 <twb> jethr0: call/cc is not in CL.
22:01:58 <Roboguy> Uh, Mono runs on OS X...
22:02:04 <mwc> the problem is that it has terrible integration
22:02:11 <twb> jethr0: CL doesn't have first class continuations -- it has dynamic-unwind instead.
22:02:19 <Roboguy> I'm using a application in Mono right now on OS X, actually
22:02:35 <jethr0> hmm, okay, i was thinking of scheme then. but i'll come up with another example :P
22:02:44 <mwc> Roboguy, last time I looked into it (6 months ago), I spent 15 hours trying to get gtk-sharp to build
22:02:51 <mwc> it was so broken
22:03:03 <Roboguy> Heh
22:03:17 <xah_> Mono is a window manager?
22:03:21 <user317> xah_: its just a great exercise, everyone needs to know how languages work
22:03:26 <twb> xah_: mono is an implementation of C#.
22:03:45 <mwc> yeah, and you need some practical API's to do anything useful with it
22:03:48 <Roboguy> You mean .NET?
22:03:50 <xah_> user317: yeah.
22:03:51 <user317> xah_: to be more exact its an implementaiton of CLI, not c#, c# is just a language that has a CLI compiler
22:03:56 <Saulzar> Mono is an implementation of .net, as well as a c# compiler..
22:04:01 <mwc> basically, MS broke it by allowing that trap door to win32
22:04:06 <twb> user317: Ah, OK.
22:04:13 <mwc> well, they didn't break it, I'm sure they had exactly this is mind
22:04:39 * xah_ don't know anything technical about .net
22:05:23 <user317> mwc: hmm, i am not aware of any api's that are win32 specific in .net
22:05:42 <xah_> frome purely language design context, i think java is the worst of the current lot.
22:05:59 <wolverian> xah_, PHP? :)
22:06:01 <mwc> user317, there's a trapdoor to the windows API in the Windows.Forms
22:06:05 <Roboguy> xah_: How about INTERCAL? =P
22:06:24 <mwc> basically, it encouraged MS lockign
22:06:38 <user317> mwc: ah ok, i am not familiar with Forms.  
22:06:41 <xah_> PHP is so called "scripting" lang, and these scripting langs are far more powerful and expressive than the likes of Java, C.
22:06:53 <wolverian> xah_, except PHP is severely broken by design.
22:06:59 <wolverian> xah_, (and implementation.)
22:07:10 <xah_> PHP, perl, python, javascript are far more POWERFUL and EXPRESSIVE than the likes of Java, C.
22:07:23 <jethr0> twb, it's harder to find a good example than i thought. but sooner or later i've always "needed" the occasional "set"
22:07:27 <mwc> more powerful? I think Turing would beg to differ
22:07:35 <xah_> wolverian: yeah, php is a hack, as is perl, and traditinoal unix shells.
22:07:41 <Roboguy> mwc: I really doubt that's what he means.
22:07:48 <jethr0> i might have worked without it, but i didn't feel lisp encouraging me to write "pure" code
22:07:50 <Roboguy> More powerful as in more means of abstraction
22:07:55 <xah_> mwc: one has to think and define what is meant by "powerful".
22:08:03 <wolverian> xah_, Perl is not a hack in the way that PHP is.
22:08:07 <jethr0> twb, but seing how hard pressed i am for an example, you might be right :P
22:08:27 <xah_> wolverian: still a hack, i'd say. Unix things are all hacks with shameless lies.
22:08:29 <jethr0> xah_, are you the infamous "xah lee"?
22:08:38 <xah_> jethr0: what do you think?
22:08:42 <mwc> The first rule of arguing on IRC is that all parties are idiots :P
22:09:28 <jethr0> xah is a pretty unusual name. and if you are, your language flamewars are well known :]
22:09:57 <Roboguy> Is lambdabot working again?
22:10:25 <xah_> unix success receipe: create a hack, shameless lies about it to advance one's own fame and wellness, lies and lies, get massive people to use it and become addicted to it, with no regard to the goodness of society; then, since massive people uses it now, inevitably gradually improve it patch-wise, so it becomes slightly better and better over the years...
22:10:52 <xah_> and most important element of weapon: $free$!!!
22:11:02 <xah_> not unlike drugs given out to children.
22:11:04 <xah_> work the same way.
22:11:06 <jethr0> xah_, you see, that's what i mean :P
22:11:37 <xah_> jethr0: yeah, i have my share of recognization. for better or worse.
22:12:21 <jethr0> well, in "moderated.c++" and "comp.lang.python" rather for worse...
22:12:51 <munga> what is the best way to code a nfa ? does anybody has an article or a url about it ?
22:13:21 <wolverian> xah_, entertaining :)
22:13:54 <user317> munga: i think you would convert it to a dfa first
22:13:54 <jethr0> wolverian :)
22:14:05 <xah_> unix things are like cockroaches, they go by the numbers.
22:14:16 <jethr0> huh?
22:14:44 <xah_> and the army of idiots in society always beat those few who really know.
22:15:06 <jethr0> xah_, so what do "those who really know" use for an operating system, then?
22:15:08 <xah_> with some exceptions.
22:15:32 <jethr0> there ain't much around that is neither unix-based nor windows
22:15:41 <jethr0> and windows has some serious problems, too!
22:15:53 <munga> user317: ok, to say he whole story: I've a regex (kind of) and I need a function f :: char -> state -> (something,newstate) where state is the old state of my dfa and char is the input ... 
22:16:02 <xah_> jethr0: your question is an FAQ. I'm a afraid i'd have to write non-stop a screed again if i were to try to answer it.
22:16:47 <user317> munga: or you could do backtracking, for each nondetermenistic part, but make sure you use breadth first search, or keep a max depth in dfs 
22:17:03 <user317> munga: hehe, i dont know enough haskell yet, i am still reading the tutorial
22:17:23 <jethr0> munga, there is an algorithm to make regexps to nfas, and then nfas to dfas...
22:19:21 <munga> jethr0: yeah, I've google this problem a bit, but all solutions are quite clumsy... I was looking for something based on monads and continutations, where the new state of my function is a continutation that then I can resume ... but I was unable to find an example or a couter example (maybe I'm talking rubbish ....)
22:21:16 <jethr0> munga, i don't really have a "good" idea to start with, but couldn't you represent states/nodes as functions, which call other functions?
22:22:20 <user317> munga: i would build a connected graph out of hte nfa and try to traverse it, your function should terminate when your string runs out or you hit the end state
22:22:50 <munga> jethr0: something like that ... I was looking for a pointer to read more . I've tried, but I got lost and it seems nobody implments dfa with CPS monads...
22:22:55 <user317> munga: i've been out of school for two years, so i may be talking out of my ass
22:24:15 <munga> user317: you can easily implement a nfa with a monadplus a writing a small interpreter that backtracks on alternatives, but this doesn't solve my problem, because I want to feed my fa incrementally, and I want the state of the computation back...
22:24:58 <jethr0> munga, maybe you could use the Data.Graph library for it...
22:25:47 <munga> uhmmm that's a good suggestion... I'll have a look at it... back to google :) thanks for you help :)
22:26:04 <jethr0> np, but i really don't know how i'd do it myself :(
22:33:40 <audreyt> @pl \xs -> listArray (0, length x - 1) (map toNative xs)
22:33:40 <lambdabot> listArray (0, length x - 1) . map toNative
22:34:20 <jethr0> @pl \xs -> listArray (0, length xs - 1) (map toNative xs)
22:34:20 <lambdabot> ap (listArray . (,) 0 . subtract 1 . length) (map toNative)
22:35:12 <audreyt> jethr0: thanks
22:35:17 <jethr0> :)
22:35:51 <audreyt> @pl \(str, key) ->  (NStr.pack str, toNative key)
22:35:52 <lambdabot> ((NStr .) . pack) *** toNative
22:36:22 <audreyt> hm, not parsing hierarchical identifiers.
22:36:24 <jethr0> ah, those arrows :P
22:36:48 <audreyt> @pl \(x, y) -> (f x, g y)
22:36:49 <lambdabot> f *** g
22:36:56 * audreyt blinks
22:37:02 <jethr0> it's the same as "first NStr.pack"
22:37:18 <jethr0> > (first (+1)) (1,2)
22:37:19 <lambdabot> (2,2)
22:37:28 <audreyt> right, of course
22:37:33 <jethr0> > ((+1) *** id) (1,2)
22:37:33 <lambdabot> (2,2)
22:38:00 <Korollary> Does anybody else change their monospace font preference every 10 weeks?
22:38:03 <jethr0> no, not the same as first... didn't see the "toNative" *argh*
22:38:51 <Saulzar> Hmm, has anyone built gtk2hs from darcs recently? I'm having troubles with "gtk2hs-config.h.in", if I create a blank file it won't compile - any idea what that file should be?
22:39:19 <audreyt> Korollary: I'm using consolas and sticking with it
22:39:35 <audreyt> (but prior to that, yeah, I was like that)
22:40:01 <audreyt> although truth to be told, it's not yet 10 weeks since I started using consolas ;)
22:40:36 <Korollary> audreyt: It looks like 'Anonymous' to me.
22:41:55 <audreyt> Korollary: the numbers and symbols are kerned to be much more readable, imho
22:42:34 <Korollary> It's not free I suppose
22:46:40 <jethr0> munga, have you looked at http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jas/Research/HaLeX/HaLeX.html ?
23:08:57 <audreyt> @hoogle Double -> Float
23:08:58 <lambdabot> No matches, try a more general search
23:09:07 <audreyt> how does one do that again?
23:09:51 <jethr0> > 1 // (2 :: Double) :: Float
23:09:52 <lambdabot>  Not in scope: `//'
23:09:56 <jethr0> > 1 / (2 :: Double) :: Float
23:09:56 <audreyt> decodeFloat followed by encodeFloat ?
23:09:57 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `Float' against `Double'
23:10:01 <jethr0> hmm
23:10:49 <Korollary> @type fromRational
23:10:50 <lambdabot> forall a. (Fractional a) => Rational -> a
23:13:25 <audreyt> @pl ((uncurry encodeFloat . decodeFloat) (1 :: Float)) :: Double
23:13:25 <lambdabot> uncurry encodeFloat (decodeFloat (1 :: Float)) :: Double
23:13:31 <audreyt> @plugs ((uncurry encodeFloat . decodeFloat) (1 :: Float)) :: Double
23:13:32 <lambdabot> 1.0
23:13:36 <audreyt> that worked
23:15:46 <Korollary> Check the class diagram here: http://haskell.org/onlinereport/basic.html
23:16:15 <Korollary> Float & Double are instances of Fractional
23:21:06 <Korollary> > (fromRational (toRational 1.0::Double)) :: Float
23:21:07 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `Double' against `Rational'
23:21:09 <Saulzar> I have been using realToFrac to convert between double/float
23:21:31 <Saulzar> > (realToFrac 1.0::Double)::Float
23:21:32 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `Float' against `Double'
23:21:46 <Korollary> yeah that should do
23:22:03 <Saulzar> > (realToFrac (1.0::Double))::Float
23:22:04 <lambdabot> 1.0
23:22:05 <Korollary> > (realToFrac 1::Double) :: Float
23:22:06 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `Float' against `Double'
23:22:25 <Korollary> ar
23:22:31 <Korollary> > (realToFrac (1::Double)) :: Float
23:22:32 <lambdabot> 1.0
23:23:21 <Korollary> I can't get off this couch...
23:23:37 <xah_> mmm... will there be a mod_haskell?
23:24:34 <Lemmih> There is an evil mod_haskell.
23:24:56 <Taral> yay
23:24:59 <Taral> my pdf parser works :)
23:25:02 <Taral> nice lazy pdf parser
23:25:15 <jethr0> taral, cool...
23:25:22 <jethr0> does the page numbering work yet?
23:26:06 <Taral> have to write that code
23:26:10 <Taral> but it parses now :)
23:26:37 <jethr0> could i have a look at the code or is it too binary based to be interesting/readable?
23:28:27 <Taral> it's not binary based
23:28:50 <Taral> but some of the parsing code is yucky
23:29:31 <Taral> not sure how to deal with references, though..
23:32:35 <Taral> no stream handling yet either, but that's fine for my purposes
23:32:52 <jethr0> sounds cool anyways... hmm, references might be tricky
23:33:15 <Taral> well, I can take them out, which works, but then re-writing an object properly becomes impossible.
23:33:38 <Taral> so right now I have a constructor Ref Object Prim, which represents an object, and a function "unref :: Prim -> Prim" that takes Refs out.
23:34:38 <jethr0> especially forward references seem to be hard to do when producing pdf output...
23:34:46 <Taral> ah, now I remember.
23:34:48 <jethr0> seems like a two pass thing
23:35:03 <Taral> Huh?
23:35:15 <Taral> Forward references aren't usually a problem.
23:35:22 <jethr0> note: i might not be making too much sense :)
23:35:29 <Taral> When reading a PDF you're seeking all over anyway, it's not an N pass thing.
23:35:56 <jethr0> i haven't looked how references look in pdf
23:37:38 <jethr0> "seeking", *yuch* :P
23:37:46 <jethr0> gotta get some sleep... good nite
23:46:37 <sieni> hmm... how do I specify the port, where the ssh server is listening to darcs
23:47:27 <sieni> ah DARCS_SSH_PORT (i guess)
23:56:01 <araujo> @index joinWith
