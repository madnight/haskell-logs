00:12:56 <Pseudonym> Must away.
00:12:57 <Pseudonym> Nytol!
00:13:05 <Pseudonym> Happy Haskell-nerding.
00:59:39 * juhp is pretty sure cvs haddock is looping on him generating gtk2hs docs
01:01:53 <tuomov> anyone know if it is possible to turn of the awful gnome file dialogs in fedora's firefox?
01:02:14 <tuomov> (someone needs beating with a cluebat...)
01:02:46 <Matt-W> replace it with a firefox that doesn't use that patch...
01:03:02 <tuomov> :(
01:03:29 * kaol has yet to see a file dialog that didn't suck
01:03:39 <tuomov> nothing sucks as much as gnome's
01:03:49 <Matt-W> And I believe it's something that's expected to be in Firefox for Linux as standard, but I might be wrong about that
01:04:13 <Matt-W> tuomov: actually, I find that Windows' and KDE's suck quite bad, I rather like GNOME's
01:04:23 <tuomov> gnome's are absolutely keyboard-unusable
01:04:27 <Matt-W> OS X's isn't particularly nice
01:04:45 <Matt-W> most of them suck though, it's like email clients and file browsers
01:04:47 <tuomov> and you actually need to open a second dialog in both cases to do anything with the kb
01:04:58 <tuomov> (both=save/open)
01:05:07 <tuomov> absolute unusability
01:05:49 <Matt-W> I have no idea whether it's a result of the whole filesystem paradigm being awful, or just because nobody's figured out how to do it right yet
01:06:11 <tuomov> it's been figured out how to do right ages ago
01:06:17 <tuomov> gnome people are just confused idiots
01:06:18 <Matt-W> where?
01:06:27 <tuomov> well, emacs for example
01:06:35 <tuomov> no dialogs! just a minibuffer with completion!
01:06:47 <Matt-W> likewise in vim
01:06:54 <Matt-W> works well for them
01:06:56 <tuomov> that's all I want, and e.g. the old gtk dialog I could have an approximation of that
01:07:00 <tuomov> but in gnome dialogs I can't
01:07:08 <Matt-W> the old gtk dialog was awful
01:07:18 <tuomov> it did have tab-completion
01:07:27 <Matt-W> that was its sole redeeming feature
01:07:32 <tuomov> in gnome dialogs I can't even go to a higher-level directory by typing ..
01:07:46 <tuomov> it's some Alt+Up or something awful
01:07:58 <tuomov> that requires moving hands from the typing position
01:10:32 <tuomov> is it possible to configure gnome to use the old gtk file dialogs?
01:11:01 <tuomov> I can't stand these mousing dialogs
01:11:30 <tuomov> everything in gnome is totally undocumented
01:11:54 <reffie> i like gnome
01:11:56 <reffie> it looks good
01:12:03 <tuomov> it's absolutely unusable crap
01:12:16 <reffie> http://segfaulted.com/Screenshot-34.png
01:12:29 <tuomov> and it's trouble even if you don't use it but write X software
01:12:44 <tuomov> http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq.html#1.13
01:13:21 <tuomov> (you can guess the number of hours spend tracking a problem that was in the end due to gnome fucking up the system)
01:28:25 <shapr> @yow !
01:28:26 <lambdabot> Where does it go when you flush?
01:28:50 <shapr> Good morning #haskell!
01:29:34 <jewel> howdy
01:29:44 <shapr> coi jewel, how's code?
01:29:54 <Mon26814> im voting for ion :P
01:30:36 <jewel> reading about beehive, a replication mechanism for overlay networks that reduces latency (they propose that it replaces DNS)
01:33:21 <shapr> Hm, it looks good at first glance.
01:34:22 <shapr> I haven't implemented any DHT algorithms, are they easy to write? If not, which is easiest?
01:35:24 <jewel> I haven't implemented any either
01:35:42 <jewel> but I downloaded Microsoft's SkipNet implementation and it seems like a lot of code
01:36:40 <jewel> (360k of C# code)
01:46:40 <shapr> That's a lot of code.
01:47:15 <Mon26814> i wonder if C# is even worth checking out.....
01:47:20 <Mon26814> never looked at it
01:47:52 <jewel> It's my first time too, I previously just assumed it was quite similar to Java
01:48:03 <Mon26814> yeah exactly
01:48:27 <Mon26814> i have been programming java and haskell for 4 years now...so i didnt think it would be worth looking at :)
02:00:47 <dblhelix> i've been programming in C# for a living for a while and I have to admit it is not bad
02:01:32 <Mon26814> but is there a real reason to learn it if you know java and haskell?
02:01:39 <Mon26814> cause i wasnt convinced of that...
02:01:44 <Mon26814> at the time anyway
02:02:01 <dblhelix> from an educational pov? no, I don't think so
02:02:45 <dblhelix> it does not provide a whole new dimension to OO-programming or something
02:03:26 <Mon26814> ofcourse when your boss tells you to, there's no real choice :)
02:03:41 <dblhelix> if you're programming for windows, and you can do .NET, it is a good choice though: you can be quite productive with it
02:03:59 <shapr> Is it more productive than Haskell?
02:04:04 <dblhelix> the .NET requirement restricts its usage to server-side programming imho
02:04:22 <dblhelix> shapr: it depends
02:04:36 <dblhelix> in general, i think it isn't
02:04:43 <Mon26814> that whole .NET thing went passed me actually
02:05:09 <jewel> I thought .NET would be suitable for client-side apps too, (moreso than Java)?
02:05:09 <Mon26814> i remember one talk from a M$ dude at our university. He was giving away M$ games for the best questions...the rest i dont remember
02:05:24 <dblhelix> I stopped using it when C# 2.0 came in beta: generics probably allow you to be more productive now
02:06:21 <dblhelix> jewel: in theory, yes... in practice, you just don't find too many client machines with the CLR installed yet
02:07:25 <dblhelix> for client-side windows programming one usually still has to provide for windows 98 SP2 installations etc.
02:07:59 <jewel> but for custom development (not large scale distribution)
02:08:12 <jewel> how would it compare to the presence of a JVM?
02:08:45 * Enveigler wonders if there is any generic guide to interpreting GHC error messages?
02:08:52 <dblhelix> jewel: for custom development there's some real nice features, yes (no touch deployment of new versions f.i.)
02:09:20 <dblhelix> jewel: don't know any numbers on VM presences
02:09:48 <dblhelix> Enveigler: look for the line number and ignore the rest of the message ;)
02:10:09 <dblhelix> that's what I do in practice, anyway :)
02:11:03 <dblhelix> at least, for most type-error messages
02:14:46 <jewel> You can hot-update your clients without them even knowing it?
02:15:12 <Enveigler> 'k
02:15:39 <dblhelix> jewel: yes, but there's a whole hierarchy of security settings for controlling what is allowed and who is trusted etc.
02:16:45 <Mon26814> like a policy file with java but then more oo ?
02:17:08 <dblhelix> Mon26814: yes, sort of
02:18:13 <jewel> but your client application doesn't need to be restarted?
02:18:35 <dblhelix> well, for one thing they did a better implementation of generics than the Java guys did :) (for what that's worth)
02:19:09 <dblhelix> jewel: well depending on the concrete implementation, that's right
02:23:47 <Mon26814> polymorphism hacked into java?
02:24:10 <dblhelix> yes, with emphasis on 'hacked'
02:24:13 <Mon26814> in a kind of after-process
02:24:14 <Mon26814> hehe
02:24:29 <Mon26814> i once read how they did that in C with rewriting templates or something like that
02:29:07 <musasabi> morning
02:30:38 <shapr> hei musasabi
02:35:18 <lisppaste2> Enveigler pasted "Why does adding a line in one function cause another function to fail?" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/10405
02:36:28 <Enveigler> Can anyone explain why print "here" works but print (elems larr) fails?
02:37:23 <dblhelix> Enveigler: is the type of elems larr an instance of Show?
02:37:32 <dblhelix> @type print
02:37:37 <lambdabot> forall a. (Show a) => a -> IO ()
02:37:55 <dblhelix> Enveigler:  you see: that is what print requires
02:38:26 <dblhelix> Enveigler: are you getting a type error that states that {something} cannot be deduced to be instance of Show?
02:38:28 <Enveigler> @type print [1..3]
02:38:30 <lambdabot> IO ()
02:39:00 <Enveigler> No. See the paste http://paste.lisp.org/display/10405
02:40:53 <Enveigler> print [1..3] works fine also and ...
02:41:17 <Enveigler> @type IOArray.elems
02:41:18 <lambdabot> bzzt
02:41:31 <Enveigler> @type Data.Array.elems
02:41:32 <lambdabot> forall e i.
02:41:32 <lambdabot>        (GHC.Arr.Ix i) =>
02:41:32 <lambdabot>        GHC.Arr.Array i e -> [e]
02:41:51 <Enveigler> gives an array
02:42:11 <Enveigler> Sorry, takes and array and returns a list.
02:42:59 <dblhelix> still, IOArray is not an instance of class IArray, which is causing the type error
02:45:46 <Enveigler> Is there a way to get a list from an IOArray?
02:46:19 <dblhelix> i'm really not an array expert... maybe someone else should step in here?
02:46:52 <Enveigler> OKay. Thanks dblhelix
02:47:49 <musasabi> getElems or getAssocs
02:48:30 <musasabi> @tyoe Data.Array.MArray.getElems
02:48:32 <lambdabot> forall e
02:48:32 <lambdabot>              (m :: * -> *)
02:48:32 <lambdabot>              i
02:48:32 <lambdabot>              (a :: * -> * -> *).

02:53:08 <Enveigler> Attempting to use either of those result in different, equally verbose but uninformative errors in a completely different function to line in question. :(
02:53:40 * shapr boings
02:53:57 <shapr> hiya Beelsebob
02:54:02 <shapr> greetings ramkrsna
02:54:02 <Beelsebob> lo
02:54:27 <ramkrsna> shapr: Hi
02:54:43 <shapr> ramkrsna: Are you learning Haskell?
02:55:34 <Enveigler> If you are, you'll need to find somewhere where there are people willing to help/
02:55:57 <shapr> It's a good thing #haskell is so helpful and friendly!
02:56:22 <Enveigler> mot
02:56:26 <shapr> mot?
02:57:26 <ramkrsna> shapr: not exactly Haskell, but gofer
02:57:42 <shapr> Ah, Gofer is pretty close.
03:04:30 <shapr> ramkrsna: If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
03:39:03 <Lemmih> Hey shapr.
03:51:20 <shapr> hiya Lemmih
03:54:05 <reffie> hi shapr
03:54:06 <reffie> hi hi hi
03:54:12 <shapr> hiya reffie, how's code?
03:54:37 <reffie> it's hard to code in the summer :(
03:54:57 <Mon26814> graduating in the summer is harder, so no whining :)
03:55:23 <dblhelix> what about starting a PhD?
03:55:33 <reffie> i graduated in the summer :P
03:55:43 <reffie> a month ago
03:56:58 <dblhelix> reffie: congrats
03:57:06 <reffie> :D thanks
03:57:16 <Mon26814> ok dblhelix, you win...i guess starting a phd is even more sucking
03:57:23 <Lemmih> shapr: I bought some shin armor (can't remember if I told you already).
03:57:25 <dblhelix> reffie: what thesis topic did you have?
03:57:27 <Mon26814> although...starting is not that shitty is it?
03:57:33 <reffie> dblhelix no thesis
03:57:39 <Mon26814> huh
03:57:41 <reffie> dblhelix just a bachelor's degree
03:57:42 <Mon26814> no thesis
03:57:45 <Mon26814> ow ok
03:58:08 <dblhelix> Mon26814:  it can be if your supervisor takes a five-week holiday just a week after you started ;)
03:58:19 <reffie> everyone here are graduate students!
03:58:58 <dblhelix> Mon26814: but, okay, honestly, it's not that bad... I think I'm doing fine at least
03:59:59 <Mon26814> jur is takin a 5-week holiday :S
04:00:04 <Mon26814> when is he back?
04:00:33 <dblhelix> August 15 or so
04:03:08 <Mon26814> ah, hmmm i'll be finished by then i think lol
04:04:08 <shapr> Lemmih: Cool, does it help?
04:04:27 <dblhelix> Mon26814: do you already know what you will be doing after you graduated?
04:04:30 <Lemmih> shapr: Hasn't arrived yet /-:
04:04:47 <shapr> jewel: Are there other DHTs that have better latency than Beehive?
04:05:38 <jewel> I'm too new to this stuff to be able to tell
04:05:46 <shapr> ok
04:05:58 <Lemmih> Looked really cool on their webpage, tho (:
04:06:09 <jewel> It seems all the others are focussed on more urgent issues like scalability
04:06:26 <jewel> and limiting the amount of network traffic used in routing updates
04:06:47 <reffie> so i reinstalled ghc yesterday
04:06:56 <jewel> I am only now starting to find papers dealing with issues like latency and data that changes frequently
04:07:05 <reffie> hoping to do some haskell stuff
04:07:06 <jewel> (unlike DNS and unlike file-sharing)
04:07:28 <pejo> dblhelix, heh. Gives you a nice excuse to wander around being confused for the first month.
04:07:45 <dblhelix> pejo: :)
04:08:00 <shapr> jewel: Are you writing a blog or other summary of your findings?
04:08:08 <jewel> but I am realising that there may be commercial implications for this kind of application
04:08:17 <shapr> Yes, I definitely think so.
04:08:23 <jewel> it's a problem that more and more people with money will be facing
04:08:30 <Mon26814> dblhelix, sort of. I didnt want to do a phd here at philips.
04:08:39 <Mon26814> that i know
04:08:48 <dblhelix> pejo: but wouldn't it be much nicer to have something impressive to show when your supervisor returns? ;)
04:08:59 <jewel> no, just reading as much as I can at the moment
04:10:06 <Spark> im starting a phd in october (at imperial still)
04:10:18 <shapr> I'm starting a PhD in 2010
04:10:23 * shapr is just guessing
04:10:25 <dblhelix> Spark:  what's your topic
04:10:33 <dblhelix> shapr: always ambitious
04:10:38 * shapr grins
04:10:39 <Lemmih> shapr: Subject?
04:10:48 <Spark> the research proposal i submitted (after staying up all night:) ) is at http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dc04/
04:11:09 <shapr> Lemmih: Use of proof assistants in automated refactoring.
04:11:13 <Spark> but generally about concurrent programming languages
04:11:28 <dblhelix> cool
04:23:11 <reffie> in 2010!
04:23:30 <shapr> Yeah, I have to get a four year degree first.
04:27:26 <Mon26814> 4? isnt that 5?
04:27:29 <Mon26814> or maybe that's just here
04:27:44 * shapr dunno
04:34:09 * beelsebo1 just did a 3 year degree
04:35:45 <Mon26814> Beelsebob, i mean the complete things, so after high school up and including when you have your master
04:35:48 <Mon26814> it is 5 years here
04:36:00 <beelsebob_> I never got a masters
04:36:13 <beelsebob_> went straight from Bachelours to PhD
04:38:14 <Mon26814> ok, well..that is not the route i was talking about anyway
04:38:48 <beelsebob_> furry muff
04:40:36 <shapr> Keeps your hands warm?
04:40:44 <beelsebob_> something like that
04:40:44 <shapr> Cold weather gear sure is handy in Sweden.
04:41:20 <beelsebob_> interesting... if you run sudo, then you don't need to enter your password for things in the GUI
04:41:34 * beelsebob_ wonders if that should be reported as a security hole
04:43:53 <boegel> @seen Itkovian
04:43:54 <lambdabot> I saw Itkovian leaving #haskell 4 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes and 34
04:43:54 <lambdabot> seconds ago, and I have missed 52 seconds since then.
04:43:59 <shapr> @seen boegel
04:44:00 <lambdabot> boegel is in #haskell. Last spoke 6 seconds ago.
04:44:09 <boegel> @seen shapr
04:44:10 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell. Last spoke 10 seconds ago.
04:44:11 <shapr> hoi boegel!
04:44:15 <boegel> yo shapr
04:44:45 <dblhelix> hi boegel! it's been a while, isn't it? were you on holiday?
04:45:01 <boegel> yeah, I was
04:45:06 <boegel> no pc for 3 weeks ! :)
04:45:17 <dblhelix> cold turkey
04:45:47 <boegel> well no, but the mouse did feel kind of strange when I first logged in again
04:46:31 <dblhelix> what are your plans for next couple of months? did you get that position at uni?
04:46:43 <beelsebob_> w00 yay... growl rocks
04:46:48 <boegel> and it wasn't turkey, it was the south of france
04:46:50 * boegel snickers
04:46:54 <dblhelix> lol
04:52:06 <boegel> dblhelix: I did, I'm there right now actually :)
04:52:27 <dblhelix> boegel: congrats!!
04:52:37 <boegel> in the next few weeks I'll be searching which way I want to go with the Phd, and write my proposal
04:52:59 <boegel> dblhelix: thanks :)
04:53:20 <boegel> they forgot to order pc's though, so I'm stuck on some student pc now
04:53:23 <beelsebob_> boegel: I'm not sure it matters hugely as long as you get somewhere close to what you want to do
04:53:36 <beelsebob_> research changes
04:53:57 <dblhelix> beelsebob: you do need some scope though
04:54:02 <beelsebob_> true
04:54:25 <beelsebob_> and a reasonable indication of what you want to do... so you actually find a supervisor with the same interests
04:56:29 <boegel> beelsebob_: well, I already have a supervisor, but he has proposed several subjects
04:56:39 <beelsebob_> ah, cool :)
04:56:52 <beelsebob_> what sort of stuff?
04:57:05 <boegel> I have to find out what pleases me the most, but I'm guessing it will have something to do with statical simualtion
04:57:22 <boegel> beelsebob_: predicting program execution time and such, low-level
04:57:26 <beelsebob_> cool
04:57:32 <beelsebob_> very cool
04:57:44 <boegel> sounded interesting to me too
04:58:07 <boegel> don't know jack about statistic stuff, but i like a leap in the dark :)
04:58:45 <beelsebob_> sounds extrardinarily painful for a few months... I'm guessing you're going to be having fun with a lot of nasty litterature
04:59:15 <dblhelix> boegel: but you'll still be a #haskell regular, won't you? ;)
04:59:48 <boegel> dblhelix: I will, I will
04:59:51 <shapr> Yes, we'll miss you if you disappear.
04:59:56 <boegel> so is Itkovian, isn't he ? :)
05:00:13 <boegel> miss me ? why that ? I'm still a noob when it comes to Haskell
05:00:29 <shapr> Nah, you wrote a cool app, that definitely takes you out of the noob category.
05:00:34 <beelsebob_> hehe
05:00:50 <boegel> anyone could've done that :)
05:00:54 <beelsebob_> you've done IO... that makes you at least a blue belt doesn't it?
05:01:21 <boegel> blue belt already ? that's a bit fast don't you think ?
05:01:24 * dblhelix never got assigned a belt on the wiki...
05:01:24 <boegel> I'd say yellow
05:01:43 * boegel doesn't even know people get belts
05:02:09 <beelsebob_> there's a belt system in the wiki somewhere
05:02:27 <dblhelix> http://haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcChannel
05:02:28 <beelsebob_> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcChannel
05:02:33 <beelsebob_> damn you
05:02:35 <tuomov> boegel: forgetting to order a computer is nothing... they forgot to tell me to show up for work last month and paid for it nevertheless :)
05:02:39 <beelsebob_> blue - proficiency with input and output
05:03:23 <dblhelix> so, there you go, boegel: you're definitely blue-belt material
05:03:34 <beelsebob_> ... at least
05:04:22 <beelsebob_> I think the belt system is cocked up anyway...
05:04:42 <beelsebob_> brown should be being able to write things *without* monads
05:05:35 <beelsebob_> The debugger I'm writing at the moment would be a peice of piss with monadic IO... but it would also be ugly and unmaintainable
05:05:37 <boegel> tuomov: hehe :)
05:05:50 <CosmicRay> good morning everyone
05:06:07 <dblhelix> morning, CosmicRay
05:06:12 <shapr> hiya CosmicRay
05:06:16 <CosmicRay> hey shapr
05:06:20 <shapr> CosmicRay: I like your HWN prototype, it's nifty.
05:06:23 <CosmicRay> hi dblhelix
05:06:27 <CosmicRay> shapr: thanks
05:07:00 <CosmicRay> shapr: for this week, I will hand-edit an ascii version.  I'll try to whip up some Haskell XML Toolkit code to create it automatically in the future
05:07:15 <shapr> It seems to me that you have a bunch of short summaries... yeah, I was thinking of ways to automate it.
05:07:30 <shapr> Seems like each entry is a short text summary and one or more urls.
05:07:37 <CosmicRay> shapr: I was thinking of sending it out Tuesdays, but then I realized that DWN comes out Tuesdays
05:07:38 <CosmicRay> yup
05:07:55 <CosmicRay> trying to give people pointers to the complete thread and any particularly notable messages within it
05:08:12 <CosmicRay> I found out how to link to a thread with gmane, which is nifty
05:10:32 <CosmicRay> shapr: the format is stolen from Debian Weekly News.  It seems to work well over there.  I added the different headings like you suggested, which I think is a nice touch
05:10:33 <beelsebob_> I wish it was possible to send ctrl-C to apps that ghc produces
05:10:41 <CosmicRay> Beelsebob: it is
05:10:46 <CosmicRay> what platform are you on?
05:10:51 <beelsebob_> yeh... but it doesn't do anything
05:10:54 <beelsebob_> OS X
05:10:54 <shapr> CosmicRay: can you paste the link here to get comments from #haskell?
05:11:06 <beelsebob_> (417)insert 'c' (insSort "diftab") ==  ?
05:11:06 <beelsebob_> no
05:11:06 <beelsebob_> ^CKilled
05:11:11 <beelsebob_> have to kill it manually
05:11:56 <CosmicRay> sure.   Feel free to take a look at http://darcs.complete.org/hwn/20050802.html, a draft of a new project called Haskell Weekly News.  Each week's edition will be posted on the web and (in plain text) to the Haskell mailing list.  comments/suggestions/flames welcome ;-)
05:12:13 <CosmicRay> Beelsebob: ^c works for other apps in OSX?
05:12:26 <CosmicRay> (just checking)
05:12:42 <beelsebob_> cosmic: yeh
05:12:45 <beelsebob_> as normal
05:12:49 <CosmicRay> hm.
05:13:01 <CosmicRay> I don't know what to tell you then, I'm afraid.  This may be a bug in the OSX port.
05:13:02 <beelsebob_> that one wasn't even looping infintely
05:13:09 <beelsebob_> it was just waiting for input
05:13:14 <CosmicRay> can you use ctrlZ and then kill %1?
05:13:41 <beelsebob_> ctrl-z?
05:13:53 <beelsebob_> is that bg?
05:14:09 <CosmicRay> not exactly... ctrl-z will pause a process and give you a shell prompt back
05:14:15 <CosmicRay> from there, you can kill it using its pid
05:14:44 <beelsebob_> I certainly can
05:14:54 <beelsebob_> that's what I'd done before... from a different terminal
05:15:33 <beelsebob_> ctrl-C sends sigterm, not sigkill doesn't it?
05:15:46 <CosmicRay> no, it sends SIGINT
05:15:59 <beelsebob_> ah yeh
05:17:45 <beelsebob_> argh! I've broken laziness *again*
05:18:04 <CosmicRay> shapr: are you interested in being a HWN editor?  I could easily add you to the hwn@complete.org alias
05:18:25 <shapr> Sure yeah. Is hwn@complete.org a darcs repo email or what?
05:19:13 <CosmicRay> it's just an alias that sends mail to me.  It is the published address for people that send contributions, and I am also going to set it up in _darcs/prefs/email for the hwn darcs repo, in case people are kind enough to send us darcs patches directly.
05:19:30 <boegel> looks cool, the HWN stuff, nice addition to THR
05:19:35 <boegel> s/THR/TMR
05:19:44 <Lunar^> yep, HWN would be something great
05:19:47 <CosmicRay> yep, I think they will complement each other nicely.
05:19:51 <shapr> Yeah, I agree.
05:20:07 <Philippa_> 'twould be a good one, especially as TMR tends to be semi-academically leaning
05:21:54 <boegel> Phillipa_: semi-semi-academically ;) (because my English sucks :p)
05:25:00 <Philippa_> boegel: yeah, and I'm one of the ones pulling it further away, but still - a lot of TMR's about making the academic stuff more accessible
05:26:00 <shapr> Yeah, TMR is all about taking research papers and making them accessible to motivated and intelligent commercial programmers.
05:26:12 <CosmicRay> which is an absolutely excellent goal
05:26:25 <CosmicRay> speaking as someone that finds many haskell research papers not that accessible
05:26:40 <CosmicRay> (marlow's are a notable exception)
05:27:03 <shapr> Yeah, I like JaffaCake's papers.
05:27:46 <shapr> I think TMR may go bimonthly if I don't get more time to recruit authors/articles.
05:27:54 <shapr> Or maybe I should recruit a recruiter?
05:28:01 <shapr> s/a/another/
05:28:06 <Lunar^> Because I've started with his papers, Marlow have setted some kind of very high expectation about paper readability for me
05:28:14 <Lunar^> now I have problem reading more common stuff :)
05:28:18 * shapr grins
05:28:23 <CosmicRay> shapr: I'll keep my eye out
05:28:32 <Philippa_> shapr: I suspect ImpureThoughts'll be a bimonthly thing anyway
05:28:39 <CosmicRay> shapr: musasabi is writing a gnutls layer, this could be an interesting topic.
05:28:49 <CosmicRay> s/layer/ffi interface/
05:28:52 <CosmicRay> <-- a little sleepy
05:31:02 <Mon26814> lol
05:31:16 <Mon26814> after forced to read the vaxen stuff about the semantics of haskell....
05:31:20 <Mon26814> papers dont scare me anymore
05:31:26 <CosmicRay> VAX and haskell?!
05:31:43 <Mon26814> no the scandinavian dude that described the complete semantics of haskell
05:31:53 <Spark> the problem i find with reading papers, is that each paper uses something from stuff before it
05:31:56 <Spark> so its hard to cut in somewhere
05:32:23 <CosmicRay> the problem I have with reading them is that so many are theory-only.  "show me some code", I want to say.
05:32:38 <shapr> Mon26814: Faxen
05:32:41 <Philippa_> haskell code makes for wonderful formalisms
05:32:42 <CosmicRay> and when they do show some code, it tends to be tiny snippets whose interaction in the real world isn't obvious
05:32:53 <shapr> CosmicRay: Yeah, I'm with you.
05:32:56 <Philippa_> yeah, that's the problem I had with the comonads-for-signals slides
05:33:02 <shapr> I want to put my hands on the code and play around with it.
05:33:08 <shapr> That's the best way for me to learn how it behaves.
05:33:15 <Philippa_> my first TMR article was all about the hooking into the real world...
05:33:40 <shapr> That's my favorite kind of TMR article as well, rough grammar, running code
05:34:05 <shapr> The Monad.Reader - Academia for Hackers
05:35:47 <shapr> Is there any support for sparse files?
05:36:04 <shapr> I guess I could just save the chunks separately.
05:36:14 <shapr> And then reorder when it's all done.
05:36:44 <Spark> CosmicRay: yeah a lot of the time i think they do not explain why the formalism is a valid model (e.g. encoding of omitted constructs with the formalism) because researchers already know that
05:38:01 <CosmicRay> shapr: sparse files?  yes, that should be there
05:38:14 <CosmicRay> shapr: basically, if you just seek past the end of a file and then write things, you have a sparse file.
05:38:26 <shapr> CosmicRay: eh?
05:38:32 <CosmicRay> shapr: I suspect that sparse files will be the easiest approach for you, and the official bt clients do that
05:38:37 <shapr> ok
05:39:21 <CosmicRay> ahh.  if you hSeeek to a position past the end of the file... ;-)
05:39:25 <CosmicRay> err, hSeek.
05:39:30 <shapr> Ah, ok
05:39:56 <CosmicRay> it calls lseek(2) under the hood.
05:40:58 <CosmicRay> http://www.unixguide.net/unix/sparse_file.shtml
05:43:09 <mflux> I think the current bittorrent client doesn't anymore use spare files
05:43:29 <mflux> however the file apparently approaches the linear order when it approaches 100%
05:43:33 <CosmicRay> hmm.  well the unix version did last I checked
05:43:45 <mflux> I run the unix version too, but the files grow
05:43:48 <mflux> they used to be sparse
05:43:54 <CosmicRay> get these files that show up as 1GB in ls -l, but du -s shows it's taking up 100K ;-)
05:44:21 <Mon25316> ok, before i got frozen by my compiling haskell app....
05:44:32 <CosmicRay> I don't know much about the BT protocol, but AFAIK, that could depend on where the blocks in the file are that it begins receiving
05:44:37 <Mon25316> this is the paper i was talking about that was probably the hardest thing to read for me: http://www.it.kth.se/~kff/semantics.ps.gz
05:44:41 <mflux> cosmicray, which version? I'm talking about 3.4.2
05:44:47 <Mon25316> and its from mr Faxen (not vaxen :P)
05:44:55 <Philippa_> semantics papers're generally a bit on the abstract side for the working coder
05:45:13 <CosmicRay> looks like 3.4.2 here too, butI haven't used bt in a few months
05:45:19 <mflux> anyway, the files appeared to be out-of-order when they weren't ready
05:45:19 <Mon25316> hehe, especially when this guy writes the static semantics of haskell
05:45:38 <mflux> but I'm not sure how it would determine the order when it resumes
05:45:44 <mflux> maybe it has some additional meta-data on partial files
05:46:53 <mflux> I just checked one partial bt, and ls -l | awk '{s+=$5} END {print s}' printed a values very close to the du -s -value. plus there were many files which were zero bytes long, plus one file which was less than its final size.
05:47:49 <shapr> Mon25316: I saw Fax√©n present that paper, and I still don't understand it.
05:48:46 <CosmicRay> shapr: what do you think about the release day question for HWN?  I think that Mondays and Fridays are bad days.  Tuesday struck me as good, but if too many *WN come out that day, it may annoy people too
05:48:50 <Mon25316> presenting the COMPLETE paper shapr ?
05:48:57 <Mon25316> that must have taken many days
05:49:17 <Mon25316> do you know how many freakin pages of schematics with the complete greek alphabet times 6 are in that paper :D
05:49:53 <Philippa_> "FFS just give your variables english names!"?
05:50:11 <Philippa_> some of the greek I find OK (tau for type makes sense, for example)
05:50:25 <Spark> its when you need to invent something in a hurry so you just put down kappa or something :)
05:50:37 <Spark> terseness is important though
05:50:40 <Spark> when youre doing proofs
05:50:51 * dblhelix uses kappa for kinds
05:50:51 <Philippa_> two-letter english acronyms work though
05:50:54 <Spark> if you explain the rules in english in the main body of the text it generally works
05:51:01 <Philippa_> that's true
05:51:40 <shapr> CosmicRay: I have no real opinion about release days.
05:51:48 <CosmicRay> ok
05:53:20 <Spark> i found a photo of me on the net :s
05:53:26 <pejo> Philippa, mathematicians rarely stick to only one alphabet though, and we all want to be mathematicians. *cough*
05:53:31 <Spark> taken while i was out clubbing
05:53:48 <Philippa_> pejo: sod that, I need to know more than that the problem I'm working on is solvable ;-)
05:53:48 <CosmicRay> Spark: flattering, I hope ;-)
05:53:54 <Spark> unfortunately not
05:53:56 <CosmicRay> Philippa_: haha
05:54:07 * Philippa_ spent an hour or so discussing a system of scientific units based on the herring with a bunch of mathmos yesterday
05:54:11 <tuomov> a A \cal{A} \mathbb{A} \frak{A}
05:54:13 <tuomov> \alpha
05:54:22 <Spark> i desperately want to airbrush out the specular highlight from my sweaty forhead :)
05:54:37 <Spark> but generally i cant pose for shit, so.. :)
05:54:42 <CosmicRay> Spark: you know, you're going to have to cough up a url before long... ;-)
05:54:44 <Spark> http://www.harddancelondon.com//albums/album163/hdlCIMG4568.jpg
05:54:45 <Philippa_> making the herring a unit of luminosity was more awkward than distance or time...
05:54:52 <tuomov> and then you have hats and tildes and whatnot
05:55:05 <Philippa_> Spark: too much black ;-)
05:55:06 <Spark> tuomov: and mathpxc :)
05:55:12 <Spark> you cant have enough black
05:55:22 <CosmicRay> Spark: that doesn't look too bad, although your left arm looks borg or something ;-)
05:55:29 <Philippa_> can too. I mean, it helps if people can actually see you and stuff...
05:55:34 <Spark> my collar has spun round so the back is at the front
05:55:48 <Spark> they can see me from the shiny bits
05:55:55 <Spark> and the white glowsticks that arent in the picture :)
05:55:59 <Philippa_> heh
05:56:13 <shapr> CosmicRay: hwn email works.
05:56:24 <CosmicRay> you know, I'm not the clubbing type, and after this, I think I'll stay that way ;-)
05:56:27 <CosmicRay> shapr: thanks
05:56:35 <Philippa_> heh
05:56:51 <Spark> CosmicRay: unfortunately, i'm addicted :F
05:56:59 <CosmicRay> heh
05:57:20 <CosmicRay> I don't even know where the nearest clubs are.  I suspect they're a 45-mile drive though.
05:57:25 <boegel> Spark: was it SM-clubbing or something ?
05:57:28 <Spark> ah thats why i moved to london
05:57:32 <CosmicRay> heh
05:57:48 <CosmicRay> so it's a 45-minute cab ride? ;-)
05:57:54 <Spark> boegel: i went to see alek szahala (alek.szahala.com) who was also dressed as a goth :)
05:58:07 <Spark> but normally i go to goth or industrial nights
05:58:24 <Philippa_> yeah, that's not quite what you'd wear too a munch. Too much actual /clothing/, for one
05:58:29 <Philippa_> *to a
05:58:31 <Spark> hehe
05:58:39 <Spark> maybe if i took the tshirt off
05:58:41 <Spark> leaving just the net thing
05:59:36 * boegel likes rock/punk shows
05:59:45 * CosmicRay prefers opera
05:59:53 <shapr> I like live music, I've seen a lot of jazz the last few months.
05:59:59 <CosmicRay> jazz is nice too
06:00:40 <Philippa_> I tend to go in for stuff like house or breaks, I should listen to more stuff though
06:00:46 <boegel> I'd love to go to the White Stripes concert over here in October, but I don't have the money/time
06:01:11 <Spark> thing with live music is you get pushed about and trodden on by little kids :)
06:01:36 <CosmicRay> a lot of people give me weird looks when I say I prefer opera, since I got into opera (and classical music in general) at about the same young age that most people get into, well, different music ;-)
06:01:48 <CosmicRay> Spark: that has *never* happened to me at the opera ;-)
06:02:03 <Spark> hehe
06:03:06 * boegel likes the pushing and shoving in rock shows, even though he's not strong enough to last longer than 10min's
06:04:26 <Philippa_> it's a great opportunity to try out all the balance-and-control stuff you've been practicing doing t'ai chi, that :-)
06:04:32 <CosmicRay> heh
06:04:46 * CosmicRay concludes that it's much safer to go listen to a symphony ;-)
06:05:17 <Mon25316> isnt there some smarter diff tool than diff?
06:05:28 <CosmicRay> smarter in what way?
06:05:43 <Mon25316> that i ignores lines numbers spaces and such
06:05:48 <Mon25316> i=it
06:05:55 <pejo> Mon, -w skips whitespace changes.
06:06:08 <beelsebo1> how would it know what a line number was?
06:06:18 <Mon25316> uhm right
06:08:25 <pejo> Mon, I'm pretty convinced I've read a paper which dealt with hte linux development model, named something along the lines of "Patch considered harmful". They had of course a new tool which was soo much better. But I can't find it now, maybe I misremember the title.
06:08:50 <Mon25316> let's just say if i put stuff spread out over multiple lines but still the same thing...i'd still want it to be seen as the same thing
06:10:04 <beelsebo1> it's strange, we've all turned Jamacan mon
06:12:31 <pejo> Mon, http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/papers/hotos.pdf
06:13:38 <Mon25316> jamacan?
06:14:13 <beelsebo1> it's like Jamaican, but with less i
06:14:26 <shapr> It's the team-oriented Jamaicans.
06:14:47 * boegel loves shapr's latest joke
06:15:06 * shapr heard lots of manager-speak in the 80s
06:15:14 <shapr> "There's no I in Team!"
06:15:31 <beelsebo1> yah mon!
06:16:33 <boegel> pass the dutchy on the left one-time
06:17:33 <Mon25316> ow lol, i thought mon was an abbreviation for Mon25316 (i.e. my name). That's why i didnt understand what you were trying to tell me
06:19:07 <beelsebo1> hehe, that's what I thought too
06:19:16 <beelsebo1> but doesn't stop us all sounding Jamaican
06:20:57 <beelsebo1> @paste anyone see why going through the mkQuestions catch all seems to consume an answer here?
06:20:58 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
06:23:59 <shapr> beelsebo1: exp never goes anywhere.
06:24:13 <beelsebo1> yeh... those are dead expressions
06:24:22 <beelsebo1> I just want to look at the next possible bug site
06:24:27 <beelsebo1> (the continuation)
06:24:45 <autrijus> @plugs 1 :: () => Int
06:24:51 <lambdabot> 1
06:25:56 <beelsebo1> note that the application one is the only patern match that actually uses tail ans
06:26:14 <autrijus> @plugs ((1 :: (Num a) => a) :: ((Integral b) => b)) :: () => Int
06:26:15 <beelsebo1> but for some reason I have to answer no every time it goes through any of the other ones
06:26:16 <lambdabot> 1
06:26:20 <autrijus> ok. good. I'm sane
06:26:23 <shapr> beelsebo1: You might want to use case instead, it might be more readable.
06:26:34 <beelsebo1> case for what?
06:26:40 <beelsebo1> rather than patern matching?
06:26:45 <shapr> Yeah, possibly.
06:27:04 <shapr> Might even be able to use partial application as well.
06:27:22 <beelsebo1> yeh... I tried to, and it decided it was gonna be dumb
06:27:27 <shapr> awright
06:27:33 <beelsebo1> (or call me dumb as the case may be)
06:27:47 <shapr> beelsebo1: My next suggestion is QuickCheck and HUnit :-)
06:28:02 <beelsebo1> sounds like a reasonable sugestion
06:28:08 <shapr> autrijus: I've been reading about your QuickCheck adventures, sounds like fun.
06:28:59 <autrijus> shapr: indeed, but QC in ST is a pain
06:29:11 <shapr> Yeah, have you read QuickCheckST.ps?
06:29:13 <autrijus> as the QC-in-ST paper can attest
06:29:16 <autrijus> yes.
06:29:17 <shapr> Ah, ok
06:29:27 <autrijus> so I'm going to abandon all hope and embrace (drum roll) unsafePerformIO.
06:29:35 <shapr> I did that too :-(
06:29:43 <autrijus> that's the only sane way out really :(
06:29:47 <autrijus> took me a full day to realize.
06:29:50 <shapr> Me too
06:30:04 <shapr> The best solution is a TestableM class as TheHunter suggested long ago.
06:30:11 <autrijus> right.
06:30:22 <autrijus> althought unsafePerformIO can do the same thing with maybe less lines
06:30:23 <shapr> But I don't have the skillz and focus to do it.
06:30:33 * boegel yawns
06:30:49 * autrijus is armed with -fno-full-laziness -fno-cse NOINLINE PLEASE
06:40:05 <shapr> hej void-
06:40:13 <shapr> void-: Learning Haskell?
06:42:01 <void-> well, yes
06:42:18 <shapr> Cool, have any questions? Need any pointers to docs or intros?
06:42:37 <boegel> welcome void-
06:42:47 <boegel> your first mission: write a ray tracer in Haskell :p
06:43:06 <shapr> My next mission in Haskell: write a bittorrent client.
06:43:50 <boegel> shapr: cool
06:44:10 <boegel> but isn't that a bit late ? I mean, there are dozens of them out there
06:44:24 <CosmicRay> none written in haskell
06:44:27 <shapr> I'm just doing this for my own entertainment.
06:44:34 <CosmicRay> plus I think it would be cool to have a generic bittorrent library in haskell.
06:44:46 <CosmicRay> a bittorrent server would be even niftier
06:44:59 <CosmicRay> server *library* that is
06:45:45 * dblhelix wishes he has time for a side project
06:46:29 <dblhelix> last week I actually wanted to play with sdl a bit, but I couldn't compile Lemmih's sdl binding :(
06:46:54 <void-> Do you know if it's possible to use opengl extensions from haskell?
06:47:37 <dblhelix> void-: well. I know there is HOpenGL, but that is a bit too low level for me, I'm afraid
06:47:37 <shapr> Sure, have you seen HOpenGL?
06:48:15 <void-> I saw that there was a GL-lib in ghc too, but no extensions what i saw
06:48:15 <boegel> is there HOpenGL support yet in gtk2hs ? duncan ?
06:48:22 <boegel> @seen duncan
06:48:23 <lambdabot> I haven't seen duncan.
06:48:32 <boegel> @seen dcoutts
06:48:33 <lambdabot> dcoutts is in #haskell. I don't know when dcoutts last spoke.
06:48:52 <dblhelix> anyone happen to have managed to get Lemmih's SDL stuff working on Mac OS?
06:49:07 * boegel forgot what SDL is
06:49:34 <void-> dblhelix: i got it to compile, but I‰m missing symbols when I try to link it with any program
06:50:16 <dblhelix> void-: mmm...
06:50:34 <void-> _SDL_main I think it was
06:50:43 <void-> but i have -lSDLmain
06:51:52 <dblhelix> which version of the SDL binding did you use?
06:52:12 <shapr> hiya edwinb, how's code?
06:52:25 <void-> 0.2
06:53:03 <edwinb> hi there
06:53:09 <dblhelix> void-: probably I'll look into this again next weekend or so... maybe we can share experiences after that?
06:53:09 <edwinb> code is starting to happen again ;)
06:54:15 <void-> dblhelix: absolutly
06:54:33 <dblhelix> void-: great!
06:57:09 <shapr> edwinb: Cool, think you'll have time to write something about dependent types or something? Or is it just code for now?
06:58:26 <edwinb> I do hope I'll actually get time to write something soon...
06:59:47 * edwinb is starting to look at dependent types for resource bounded functional programming, which ought to be fun.
07:02:05 <shapr> That does sound quite cool.
07:02:21 <yaarg> is that when you write function programs in a box?
07:03:52 <beelsebo1> hehe... there's a box big enough here
07:04:45 * shapr hacks chunks out of FastPackedString.hs
07:05:23 * beelsebo1 hacks chunks out of VSExp.hs
07:05:33 <CosmicRay> shapr: would any of that be useful in missingh?
07:37:47 <Beelsebob_> blurgh
07:40:28 <Lemmih> ozone: Ping.
07:41:41 <Beelsebob_> woo yay, the new hat-detect works
07:44:08 <Lemmih> Greetings SyntaxNinja.
07:44:22 <Lemmih> You're on early.
07:44:25 * boegel leaves
07:44:43 * Beelsebob_ trees
07:55:56 <SyntaxNinja> hi Lemmih; yeah, got up early today, started working from home.
07:58:01 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: My debian contact didn't have his ID with him today, so I'll try again tomorrow.
07:59:36 <SyntaxNinja> you don't need his ID to get your key signed.
08:00:10 <ibid> though many people won't sign if they can't expect to get a countersignature
08:07:50 * SyntaxNinja nods
08:08:56 <ibid> but in that case, i would have signed, since it would have been my mistake why i didn't have the id
08:11:23 <Beelsebob_> bah... memorisation just doubled the size of my debugger :(
08:13:48 <CosmicRay> Lemmih: you going through NM?
08:14:40 <Lemmih> NM?
08:14:56 <ibid> the new maintainer process
08:15:05 * ibid wonders if i should take on another applicant
08:15:50 <CosmicRay> from the threads today, sounds like yes.
08:15:57 <CosmicRay> I really ought to start taking applicants myself.
08:16:04 <CosmicRay> I've ran out of time for that, mainly.
08:17:05 * ibid is hesitant, because i'm a newbie am and i'd prefer to do one application completely before upping my max so that i know the workload it generates
08:17:18 <CosmicRay> yeah that's a good plan
08:17:26 <SyntaxNinja> hi CosmicRay
08:17:27 <autrijus> hm, another nice GHC error msg
08:17:32 <CosmicRay> morning syntaxninja
08:17:39 <autrijus> Can't make a derived instance of `Arbitrary Name', even with cunning newtype deriving
08:17:40 <Igloo> Do AMs get to choose their NMs, BTW, or is it a queue?
08:17:48 <CosmicRay> Igloo: it's a queue
08:17:53 <ibid> the other point is that i'm currently idling as an am, waiting for the applicant to complete my spiced version of the P&P1 template
08:18:11 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: any feedback you might have on http://darcs.complete.org/hwn/20050802.html (a draft) would be welcome
08:18:21 <ibid> (he's not awol, in case you're wondering:)
08:20:06 * ibid gets to teach fp and haskell again in october
08:20:27 <CosmicRay> ibid: sounds like fun
08:21:18 * ibid started re-composing the lecture notes today
08:21:31 <ibid> (editing old notes and adding new stuff)
08:21:49 <Igloo> Oh, can either of you explain the mode/medians > max on http://nm.debian.org/index.php BTW?
08:22:20 <CosmicRay> as far as what does a mode or median mean?
08:22:34 <Igloo> eh?
08:22:44 <CosmicRay> are you asking "what does median mean"?
08:22:56 <Igloo> I'm asking "how is the median bigger than the max?"
08:23:07 <CosmicRay> ah.
08:23:21 <CosmicRay> nope ;-)
08:23:36 <ibid> you mean the "New Maintainers processed" row?
08:23:51 <Igloo> And the "Awaiting DAM Approval" one
08:24:44 <ibid> no idea
08:25:06 <SyntaxNinja> you forgot to add "isaac whined and moped" to the cabal discussion ;)
08:25:13 <CosmicRay> hehe
08:26:48 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: do you have a url for that? ;-)
08:29:31 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja, CosmicRay: as I am stuck with riot and yi until GHC 6.4.1 enter unstable, is there anything other Haskell tools waiting to be packaged?
08:30:30 <CosmicRay> Lunar^: if you're waiting due to the gmp problem, I'd say go ahead and upload now
08:30:48 <CosmicRay> someone is working on haxml with syntaxninja I believe...
08:30:57 <CosmicRay> it might be nice to see the haskell xml toolkit out there...
08:31:08 <CosmicRay> there were some c2hs packages that needed a sponsor, but I couldn't build them here
08:31:14 <CosmicRay> (the c2hs packages were in the debian-haskell list)
08:32:18 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: nope, I'm stuck because of the curses bug
08:33:08 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: using -fvia-C leads to curses initialization problem, and -fasm segfaults on my PPC
08:33:16 <CosmicRay> Lunar^: weird.
08:33:26 <Igloo> Have you tried a 6.4.1 pre?
08:34:36 <Lunar^> Igloo: is there any package available?  My laptop does not stay in the same place for more than 4-5 hours these days
08:35:17 <Igloo> No
08:37:00 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: reported here http://haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-bugs/2005-June/005193.html
08:38:00 <musasabi> 6.4.1 should be quite soon.
08:38:04 <musasabi> hopefully.
08:45:29 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: Wolfgang did not answered at all, maybe I should send him another mail about this?
08:46:14 <CosmicRay> Lunar^: I don't know, I'm not really a GHC hacker (also your link didn't contain any text)
08:46:38 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: strange :(
08:46:48 <CosmicRay> something about text not being renderable
08:50:01 <ibid> gah, darcs is a victim of the c++ transition :(
08:50:32 <CosmicRay> ibid: you could always manually rebuild GHC on all the necessary platforms, wich the correct libgmp ;-)
08:50:50 <ibid> why all?:)
08:51:10 <Lemmih> The c++ transition?
08:51:11 <ibid> i don't think i have enough ram to build ghc, actually
08:51:12 <CosmicRay> ibid: because ghc is uninstallable in sid, and ghc build-deps on ghc, so the autobuilders can't build it
08:51:16 <ibid> Lemmih: debian unstable
08:51:23 <CosmicRay> you can use debian development machines
08:51:34 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: http://www.mail-archive.com/glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org/msg07478.html
08:51:41 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: pipermail sucks
08:51:43 <ibid> CosmicRay: for that, i need to get the build-deps installed :/
08:52:22 <CosmicRay> ibid: most of them have ghc6 installed already, but not the correct libgmp3-dev.  of course, the correct libgmp3-dev conflicts with ghc6.
08:52:29 <CosmicRay> so you will have to manually provide one or the other
08:52:50 <ibid> how long until 6.4.1?
08:53:00 <CosmicRay> right now, since most of them have ghc6, I'd figure on manually supplying libgmp3-dev.
08:53:01 * ibid is trying to figure if it's worth it
08:53:16 <CosmicRay> somebody is going to have to do this at some point anyway
08:53:31 <ibid> i'd prefer it was the ghc maintainer, actually :)
08:53:45 <ibid> it's too easy for unaccustomed to make mistakes
08:53:53 <CosmicRay> yes, well that's igloo and he understandably isn't too thrilled about having to do this either ;-)
08:54:14 <Igloo> Where'd you get that from?
08:54:33 <Igloo> Obviously I'd prefer if it wasn't necessary, but like I told you, I'll do it when 6.4.1 comes out
08:54:48 <CosmicRay> Igloo: I guess I just assumed, given that it hasn't happened yet and that it's annoying
08:54:51 <ibid> which brings us to 18:53  <ibid> how long until 6.4.1?
08:54:51 <ibid> :)
08:55:01 <CosmicRay> I'd be surprised if you were thrilled about having to do it ;-)
08:55:15 <Igloo> A week or 2 was the word earlier today
08:55:19 <ibid> ok
08:55:35 <ibid> i think i can live with this for a couple of weeks
08:55:47 <ibid> i can use my sarge chroot
08:55:56 <ibid> for development
08:55:58 <CosmicRay> you can just install sarge libgmp3 in sid as well.
08:56:30 <ibid> and since it sees my /home, i can use sarge chroot's darcs to manage my source
08:56:43 <ibid> CosmicRay: yeah, but then i can't install other stuff i need :)
08:56:52 <Igloo> Bah, looks like debootstrap is still broken
08:56:56 <ibid> (and my c++ project gets weird linking)
08:57:04 <CosmicRay>  Igloo: try cdebootstrap?
08:57:19 <ibid> cdebootstrap looks much better, except it doesn't do archive verification
08:57:25 <ibid> much faster
08:57:33 <Igloo> Do you know that that isn't affected by the breakage?
08:57:48 <CosmicRay> Igloo: what particular breakage are you seeing?
08:58:27 <ibid> Igloo: depends on what you use it for
08:58:29 <Igloo> Not being able to directly make an unstable chroot (I'm going by the #d-d topic here, not actually trying it ATM)
08:58:39 <ibid> Igloo: both work for that
08:58:49 <CosmicRay> hmm, it may be that it's impossible to make an unstable chroot given the state of unstable at the moment.
08:58:57 <CosmicRay> but I haven't researched that at all.
08:59:00 <ibid> Igloo: it's the buildd flavour in debootstrap that's broken
08:59:05 <CosmicRay> I'd suggest making a stable chroot, then upgrading it.
08:59:08 <ibid> well, worked last week, at least
08:59:19 <ibid> even upgrading from stable to unstable is a challenge
08:59:21 * ibid tried that
08:59:24 <Igloo> Ah, OK
08:59:27 <ibid> did that, actually
08:59:53 <Igloo> thanks
09:03:08 <Mon25316> ffs, im not going home before i found this bug
09:11:58 <Lemmih> Mon25316: Got the code online?
09:18:08 <Mon25316> ow really, it is waaaaaaay too big. somewhere in my c code generators something goes wrong and i put comments around some attribute where the equivalent c code generator that i modelled it after doesnt....
09:50:18 <TheHunter> @index exitWith
09:50:19 <lambdabot> System.Exit
10:21:28 <wilx> Hah!
10:21:32 <wilx> Question.
10:21:40 * basti_ listens
10:21:44 <Beelsebob> hah!
10:21:46 <Beelsebob> answer!
10:21:53 <wilx> Mmm, never mind. I should rather ask in #darcs :)
10:33:00 <autrijus> hm. I have a data type that has three constructors that takes different arguments types, but in four levels deep, there is a common field shared by them in the same type.
10:33:13 <autrijus> I don't like to write 12 case constructs to retrieve that common fields.
10:33:23 <autrijus> is that a classical application of "boil your scratchpad"?
10:33:44 <SyntaxNinja> hm. how do you tell gnome to use a different web browser when opening links?
10:34:11 <autrijus> gnome-default-applications-properties
10:34:18 <autrijus> (/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-default-applications-properties)
10:49:44 <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: excellent, thanks.
10:54:36 <SyntaxNinja> @seen shapr
10:54:37 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell. Last spoke 3 hours, 49 minutes and 51 seconds
10:54:37 <lambdabot> ago.
11:17:47 <basti_> @pl \x y->(fst x)==(fst y)
11:17:48 <lambdabot> (. fst) . (==) . fst
11:17:53 <basti_> ugh
11:17:56 <basti_> how ugly
11:19:44 <monochrom> @pl \(x,_) (y,_) -> x==y
11:19:45 <lambdabot> (`ap` snd) . (. fst) . (const .) . (==) . fst
11:19:48 <lispy> basti_: foldl1 (==) map fst [x,y]
11:20:04 <basti_> its not getting better is it? .)
11:20:09 <monochrom> hehe
11:21:08 <lispy> @pl \x y -> foldl1 (==) (map fst [x,y])
11:21:09 <lambdabot> ((foldl1 (==) . map fst) .) . (. return) . (:)
11:21:13 <lispy> hehe
11:21:29 <basti_> i've never seen 3 . in row before.
11:21:36 <mflux> yeah, the pointless version is much preferred..
11:22:00 <lispy> basti_: you mean .) . (. ?
11:22:07 <basti_> yes
11:22:16 <lispy> yeah that is odd
11:22:18 <lispy> r
11:35:26 <samc> Is that really as nice as it gets? I'm going back to stack languages for my pointless pleasure
11:44:44 <lispy> push x; push fst; apply; push y; push fst; apply; push eq; apply; pop
11:46:49 <samc> fst swap fst =  :P
11:47:52 <lispy> heh, nice
11:51:26 * wagle reads "." as "point"
11:54:55 <monochrom> Prefix/Postfix languages are full abstractions of stack languages.
11:56:47 <samc> wagle: what's your .? monochrom, what's yours?
11:59:06 <lispy> wt.?
12:02:36 <monochrom> My . is that there is no need to indulge in such an operational tarpit as a stack language, as there are more abstract choices with the same power.
12:09:17 <lispy> @type My . is
12:09:25 <lambdabot> bzzt
12:09:45 <monochrom> haha you have no .
12:12:01 <samc> there's nothing intrinsically operational about a stack language, (just less mathematically elegant ), as for the same "power" for pointless programming (what was being discussed) evidently not built into haskell see "(. fst) . (==) . fst" vs. "fst swap fst ="
12:12:42 <samc> I am half-joking btw
12:18:13 <monochrom> What is the semantics of a stack language, if not prescribing a state (the stack) and how each command transforms the state - therefore being intrinsically operational?
12:20:13 <samc> What is the semantics of a functional language, if not prescribing a state (the function arguments) and how each command transforms the state - therefore being intrinsically operational?
12:20:40 <monochrom> The latter language can be given a denotational semantics instead.
12:20:55 <samc> and so can a stack language
12:21:16 <samc> anyway we are arguing about ill-defined terms
12:21:19 <monochrom> I know of a language that has never been given an operational semantics.
12:21:34 <samc> yes?
12:21:57 <monochrom> Dijkstra's Guarded Commang Language.  It has only been given a weakest-precondition semantics.
12:22:46 <samc> Andrew Cooke (I think) implemented it that's an operational definition :)
12:22:54 <monochrom> I know some of these terms are ill-defined, but I don't think we have stepped into a grey area yet.
12:24:05 <lispy> in my PL class they didn't teach denotation semantics :(  I still need to learn about them
12:24:19 <lispy> we learned operations and the other one....
12:24:24 <lispy> what is the other noe....
12:24:35 <samc> algebraic?
12:24:47 <lispy> the one where you give a virtual machine
12:24:59 <lispy> that's operational right?
12:24:59 <ibid> that's operational
12:25:20 <lispy> okay, and then the one where it's interms of pre and post conditions?
12:26:17 <monochrom> A stack language permits a program like "push x; push y" corresponding to no well-formed expressions.  To give it a denotational semantics, you still have to resort to saying "a program maps state to state" so it is still operational.
12:27:18 <monochrom> The pre-post one is usually called either "Hoare" or "axiomatic".
12:28:23 <monochrom> The name "axiomatic" was really chosen for lack of a better name (plus it was a long time ago when nothing else was axiomatic).
12:29:18 <samc> I'm aware of Hoare triples, weakest preconditions, etc.
12:29:32 <ibid> aiui, it was not chosen for a lack of a better name, it was really developed to be the axiomatic basis for computer programming
12:29:55 <monochrom> No dispute there.  I was answering lispy.
12:30:23 <samc> since you can consider any imperative programming as a functional one by passing the whole state around, I don't know what to say
12:30:25 <beelsebo1> buh!
12:30:40 <samc> it's a matter of elegance I guess?
12:30:56 <monochrom> Yes yes, but today everything is derived from one axiom or another, so the name "axiomatic" isn't very specific.
12:31:46 <monochrom> Historically it was the first axiomatization, yes.
12:33:12 <samc> monochrom, see http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html
12:34:25 <monochrom> is it a stack language?  which commands are push and pop?
12:35:14 <TheHunter> @pl \(x,_) (y,_) -> x == y
12:35:15 <lambdabot> (`ap` snd) . (. fst) . (const .) . (==) . fst
12:35:24 <TheHunter> @pl \x y -> fst x == fst y
12:35:24 <lambdabot> (. fst) . (==) . fst
12:36:14 <samc> monochrom, I consider it one, perhaps you don't. see ill-defined terms :)
12:40:30 <monochrom> This language is in a grey area indeed.
12:41:21 <monochrom> It is somewhat unorthodox to declare "the whole stack is the output I want, so it's a sought value not merely an internal state!"
12:44:14 <samc> but as it is an analogue to the combinatory calculus rather than a full-blown programming language...
12:45:01 <samc> monochrom, what is your thesis topic, if you don't mind me asking?
12:47:42 <monochrom> I give operational semantics to http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hehner/aPToP/ .  I have one for eager execution, another for lazy execution.  I also give a non-operational, compositional way of proving time bounds of lazy programs.
12:49:11 <monochrom> (The last one of course needs to be proved sound against the operational semantics for lazy execution)
12:50:19 <monochrom> But right now I am not doing my thesis.  I am taking up a side interest and proving converses and giving counterexamples of three well-known theorems in the weakest-precondition world.
12:51:02 <monochrom> (How can I both prove and give counterexamples?  Well, I prove the expected converses, then I disprove certain generalizations.)
12:51:30 <monochrom> I'll show you when I'm done in a few days.
12:56:10 <samc> I'll look forward to it :)
12:58:10 <samc> I always like to find things are equivalences and not just implications
12:58:25 <beelsebob_> heh
13:01:16 * samc was serious
13:02:11 <lispy> samc: that's a common goal among mathematicans from what i understand
13:04:27 <ibid> equivalences are just double implications :) of course it's better to show more than less
13:05:08 <lispy> finding good equivallence relations is a sign of a good mathematician, IMHO
13:05:41 <lispy> but i'm biased towards the algebriac approaches and that's a pretty fundamental ideas in those
13:06:40 <beelsebob_> woo yay!
13:06:56 <beelsebob_> It WORKS!!!!!
13:07:02 <lispy> it?
13:07:03 <beelsebob_> (mwuhuhuhuhuhu)
13:07:07 <beelsebob_> hat-detect 2
13:07:13 <beelsebob_> soon to become hat-delta
13:07:25 <lispy> delta as in delta debugging?
13:07:29 <beelsebob_> yes
13:07:31 <lispy> cool!
13:07:34 <beelsebob_> yes
13:07:36 <beelsebob_> :)
13:08:00 <thedward> delta debugging?
13:08:31 <beelsebob_> comparison of different traces to identify a bug automagically
13:08:32 <lispy> thedward: it's an automatic debugging technique, helps you locate places where the fault is most likely to be
13:08:58 <beelsebob_> lispy: It's more a set of techniques now
13:09:21 <lispy> beelsebob_: true, what is the latest enhancement?  debugging in time or something?
13:09:21 <beelsebob_> my version for functional languages is significatly different to zellers for imperative languages
13:09:39 <beelsebob_> lispy: no, that will be the last one I do... if I ever get there
13:09:41 <thedward> neat
13:09:43 <Philippa_> it'd have to be. You making any progress since we talked about it?
13:09:47 <lispy> i would imagine there are domain specific tweaks that can be done
13:10:00 <beelsebob_> I may decide it is good enough without the bother
13:10:11 <Philippa_> and they probably have parametric generalisations for the most part too. Never-ending research, yay!
13:10:15 <lispy> beelsebob_: no keep going all the way!  ;)
13:10:19 <beelsebob_> philippa: I've got a basic implementation that grabs information and displays it
13:10:39 <lispy> beelsebob_: make it the coolest automatic debugging tool ever :)
13:10:47 <beelsebob_> lispy: I plan on it
13:10:52 <Philippa_> what kind of information? Pretty much a complete execution trace?
13:10:54 <lispy> then people will have to switch to haskell just for the debugging support
13:11:08 * Philippa_ finds ghci a neat piece of debugging support
13:11:09 <beelsebob_> philippa: no... you get that by doing hat-check -a
13:11:20 <Philippa_> ah. Extra info, then?
13:11:31 <beelsebob_> information such as where it thinks the bug is/isn't
13:11:43 <lispy> Philippa_: yes, having access to the languages engine and being able to interact with the pieces of your program is wonderful
13:11:44 <beelsebob_> the next stage is to automatically direct the bug search using that info
13:11:47 <Philippa_> (the problem with ghci is that it's still awkward to try out computations in non-IO monads)
13:12:05 <Philippa_> lispy: given your nick that response is predictable ;-)
13:12:12 <beelsebob_> lol
13:12:16 <lispy> heh
13:12:46 <beelsebob_> but at least it can be used as a declarative debugger, if not much more now
13:13:03 <lispy> not having that makes programming in Java/C/whatever much harder for me these days.  I like to know the code will do what I expect before i commit to it
13:13:57 <lispy> and if you can't get the software written, the debugging support won't matter :)
13:14:35 <beelsebob_> philippa: @paste
13:15:05 <gzl> lispy: not having what?
13:15:09 <beelsebob_> it should get a chunk better than that
13:16:21 <lispy> gzl: that interactive ability with the evaluator
13:17:58 <lispy> i tend to write my program in the ghci prompt, copy part of the code i'm working with (usually just replacing concrete values with parameters) and give it a name
13:18:20 <Philippa_> I do the :r; test thing
13:18:38 <beelsebob_> I just use ghc
13:18:42 <Philippa_> but it takes me a comparatively long time to write a given line of code
13:18:56 <Philippa_> I have to do that for Flippi, it's irritating
13:19:05 <beelsebob_> ditto... I spend a lot of time thinking about code
13:19:11 <Philippa_> worse is when the crappy version of IIS that comes with windows does something stupid
13:19:15 <beelsebob_> 95% of the time it works first time
13:19:20 <lispy> Philippa_: i have to do that with darcs, it's too big and complex for me to figure out how to use it from ghci
13:19:22 <beelsebob_> sometimes it's a pain in the arse
13:19:23 <Philippa_> then you spend ages working out WTF's gone wrong before eventually rebooting...
13:20:14 <lispy> Philippa_: is apache not an option?  you need something IIS specific?
13:20:24 <Philippa_> no, I just haven't got round to setting up apache yet
13:20:27 <musasabi> Well one can choose his own pain. Working with windows is just too painful ;)
13:21:00 <musasabi> Actually apache seems easier to use on win32 than IIS - then again I am familiar with apache and not with IIS.
13:21:54 <lispy> i think apache is safer to run also
13:21:56 <Philippa_> it took me a short while to figure out how to point it at my test directory, then it's mostly fire and forget
13:22:00 <Philippa_> damn right it's safer though
13:22:16 <Philippa_> there's a reason I don't leave it running if I put this box in the router's DMZ for some gaming
13:22:41 <lispy> does the DMZ really help with gaming?  I've never needed to use DMZ
13:24:54 <Philippa_> insofar as it makes the router invisible, yes
13:25:04 <Philippa_> useful if you don't know which ports you need
13:25:13 <Philippa_> or if it's a silly number, or keeps changing, or...
13:25:44 <lispy> hmm....i should try that with westnoth sometime
13:26:00 <lispy> as i recall, we had a pain trying to connect p2p servers
13:29:06 <wilx> Woohoo!!!
13:29:15 * wilx calls FBI on lispy.
13:29:21 <wilx> You bad bad pirate!!
13:29:27 <beelsebob_> ?
13:29:40 <beelsebob_> he never said he was sharing copyrighted material
13:29:57 <monochrom> I am sure lispy uses p2p for such legal things as the ICFP CD only.
13:30:02 <wilx> :D
13:30:24 <monochrom> Also the video demo of SLIME
13:30:54 <wilx> Yeah, right, and my name is Buddha.
13:31:03 <lispy> wilx: no p2p sharing, just trying to make the westnoth clients able to communicate
13:31:06 <beelsebob_> really? You're an algorithmic debugger?
13:31:29 <wilx> Bah, that was a bad choice for this channel...
13:31:37 * lispy doesn't like SLIME, so he would have no reason to share the video
13:32:00 <beelsebob_> :P
13:32:20 <beelsebob_> it's fun actually being able to do some research
13:32:44 <Heffalump> @seen jaffacake
13:32:44 <lispy> SLIME is a prefect example of an interface that does what it wants to do, and then breaks a lot.
13:32:44 <lambdabot> I saw jaffacake leaving #haskell 4 days, 2 hours, 23 minutes and 27
13:32:44 <lambdabot> seconds ago, and I have missed 52 seconds since then.
13:34:24 <lispy> lambdabot: what does it mean that you've missed 52 seconds?  You've been away from the channel?
13:35:25 <Philippa_> I'd imagine so
13:35:49 <Heffalump> probably during reconnections
13:37:03 * lispy is in a mood to complain about SLIME, but guesses no one cares :)
13:37:29 <lispy> the people in #lisp get really annoyed when i bring it up...they treat me like a troll...
13:37:36 <jyp> rants > #lisp  :)
13:37:41 <lispy> heh
13:38:19 <lispy> cat slime-rants.txt >> #lisp
13:38:35 <lispy> chmod u-r #lisp
13:38:49 <jyp> make it more haskellish: rants >>= (# lisp)
13:38:55 <jyp> :p
13:39:03 <lispy> @hoogle #
13:39:06 <basti_> lisp accepts a parameter?
13:39:08 <basti_> .)
13:39:17 <Heffalump> SLIME?
13:39:51 <lispy> Heffalump: it's an emacs mode for editing lisp
13:40:12 <Heffalump> ah
13:40:35 <lispy> @vixen are you ignoring hoogle today?
13:40:36 <lambdabot> yes, i am
13:40:43 <lispy> ah, that explains a lot
13:41:17 <basti_> sometimes i think news pages editors are on crack
13:41:33 <lispy> basti_: do you live in the US?
13:41:36 <basti_> no
13:41:39 <basti_> germany
13:41:50 <basti_> i do not dare to imagine what kind of drugs US editors do
13:41:58 <lispy> ah, because the US news is very much on crack :)
13:42:09 <lispy> ya :(
13:42:23 <lispy> the daily show is the only US news i trust...
13:42:43 <basti_> there was a case of multiple "neonaticide" (a mother killing her newborn babies). What does "Der Spiegel" title? "EIN DORF IM ABGRUND!" (a village in the abyss)
13:42:47 <basti_> i mean... come on...
13:43:07 <lispy> oh weird
13:43:35 <basti_> "Jens Todt from Brieskow-Finkenheerd"
13:43:46 <basti_> is that parody?
13:44:35 <basti_> sometimes i want to emigrate to antarctica
13:45:44 <lispy> basti_: have you seen the recent movie Madagascar?
13:45:44 <samc> Der Spiegel rocks, I wish we got headlines like that
13:46:09 <basti_> lispy: no, but i'm planning to, so don't spoil, please :)
13:46:22 <lispy> basti_: there were penguins in that who were looking to emigrate to antarctica
13:46:30 <basti_> ahh.
13:46:30 <basti_> -g-
13:46:31 <lispy> oh, i say no more
13:46:47 <basti_> ive seen the penguins in the trailer i think
13:46:52 <lispy> ya
13:47:03 <lispy> it's funny, but not as good as say, Shrek
13:47:28 <basti_> i see.
13:48:23 <lispy> the penguins were my favorite part
13:48:34 <lispy> or rather favorite characters
13:49:19 * boegel wants to see Madagascar too, but can't get his gf to come along
13:49:28 <basti_> not?
13:49:33 <basti_> what kind of a woman is that?
13:49:48 <basti_> what movies did she like?
13:50:02 <Philippa_> heh
13:50:21 <Philippa_> I saw Madagascar today, but largely because I felt like a laugh
13:50:23 <boegel> well, she does like anim movies (I have 'em all on dvd), but some gf of her told her Madagascar is no good
13:50:29 <boegel> and now she won't come along
13:50:41 <basti_> ah
13:50:42 <Philippa_> still have Move It stuck in my head. There were kids coming out singing it who weren't alive when it was first released...
13:51:11 <boegel> that reminds me, I have to buy Shark Tale on dvd...
13:51:27 <basti_> move it is a mighty song
13:51:36 <beelsebob_> It doesn't matter - I have another one
13:51:39 <beelsebob_> it has a gecco on
13:51:53 <Philippa_> madagascar has a couple of absolutely filthy jokes that the kids have no chance of actually getting whatsoever, btw
13:51:59 <beelsebob_> indeed
13:52:11 <beelsebob_> t'was very funny
13:52:16 <samc> I bet you think that about all films
13:52:16 * boegel likes filthy jokes
13:52:25 <boegel> there's stuff like that in Shrek too
13:52:25 <Philippa_> samc: this was *really* blatant
13:52:27 <beelsebob_> samc: no, it really does
13:52:30 <Philippa_> Beelsebob: the "relax" bit?
13:52:44 <boegel> don't spoil stuff, goddamned ! ! !
13:53:00 <beelsebob_> having said that, I though that Lord of the Rings was mostly an excuse for boy kissing
13:53:10 * Philippa_ sniggers
13:53:15 <Philippa_> well, it is /now/
13:53:17 * basti_ groans
13:53:29 <beelsebob_> philippa: you seen the very secret diaries?
13:53:30 <Philippa_> I don't do slashfic myself, boy-on-boy doesn't interest me, but hey
13:53:42 <basti_> i may cite: "nice to see that you people aren't preoccupied with certain themes"
13:53:42 <Philippa_> nope. Read a treebeard/legolas piece though
13:53:44 <beelsebob_> hehe, slash is the best kind of fic
13:54:01 <beelsebob_> hehe, legolas is funny in it
13:54:09 <Philippa_> it's good as comedy sometimes - someone on my LJ flist did RMS/ESR
13:54:19 <basti_> shall i reveal a naughty secret of mine?
13:54:31 <wilx> Speaking of LOTR, has anybody seen the LOTR spoof with Jack Black?
13:54:33 <beelsebob_> who are you on LJ philippa?
13:54:50 <wilx> MTV movie awards thingy.
13:55:06 <wilx> I find it very hilarious.
13:55:10 <Philippa_> beelsebob_: flippac
13:55:19 <beelsebob_> http://www.ealasaid.com/misc/vsd/ gandalf is the funniest
13:55:34 <Philippa_> several folks here've found it already, as my web site's got a link to it (and is known of after things like the Flippi releases)
13:56:01 * beelsebob_ adds you
13:56:48 * Philippa_ is thinking it's really time to set some filters up
13:57:03 <Philippa_> I'm starting to get folks on my flist who I'm not entirely sure I should be showing some of my locked posts...
13:57:11 <beelsebob_> haha
13:57:17 <beelsebob_> who like? Relatives?
13:57:26 <beelsebob_> or do you not mean the fic filled ones?
13:58:13 <Philippa_> I don't post fic, though if I did it'd be public
13:58:40 <Philippa_> but I'm starting to end up with acquaintances as well as friends on there, IYSWIM
13:58:46 <beelsebob_> ah, k
13:58:51 <beelsebob_> fair enough :)
13:59:36 <beelsebob_> I very rarely update these days
13:59:43 <beelsebob_> I don't have too much time any more
13:59:50 <beelsebob_> I should make more of an effort
13:59:59 * boegel leaves again and wonders where Itkovian is hanging out
14:00:10 <beelsebob_> @seen Itkovian
14:00:11 <lambdabot> I saw Itkovian leaving #haskell 5 days, 7 hours, 36 minutes and 52
14:00:11 <lambdabot> seconds ago, and I have missed 52 seconds since then.
14:00:17 <beelsebob_> oh dear
14:00:24 <boegel> yeha
14:00:30 <boegel> he's on holiday probably
14:00:46 <beelsebob_> holiday?
14:00:49 <beelsebob_> what's that?
14:01:00 * beelsebob_ realises he's done that joke before
14:01:08 * beelsebob_ realises it wasn't funny then either
14:01:11 <boegel> that's lying in the sun for 3 weeks straight without touching a computer
14:01:24 <beelsebob_> sounds like torture
14:01:38 <boegel> nah, it was pretty nice
14:03:09 <beelsebob_> I do actually get a holiday in a week and a half :)
14:03:34 <beelsebob_> but it won't involve the sun
14:03:50 <boegel> doesn't have to
14:03:50 <jyp> normally you die after 2/3 days of "lying in the sun"
14:04:00 <SyntaxNinja> woohoo
14:04:04 * SyntaxNinja speeds up program
14:04:19 <jyp> cheerah
14:04:25 <boegel> jyp: oh man :p it also involved lot's of swimming, eating, sleeping and sex, fine ? :p
14:04:25 * beelsebob_ is going here http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Torridon&ll=57.523520,-5.649029&spn=0.019615,0.063356&hl=en
14:04:55 <jyp> lol
14:05:22 * basti_ would like quiet without sun
14:05:53 <jyp> I'm not sure I wanted to know about the intimate details :p
14:06:00 <basti_> though, a little sun would be nice
14:07:10 * boegel just read the logs and now knows dcoutts think HRay code is sucky because it's not incremental
14:07:19 * boegel kicks dcoutts in his sleep :p
14:07:48 * beelsebob_ wonders why Edinburgh doesn't have accurate satalite photography
14:09:57 <Spark> cos its up north
14:10:05 <jyp> good night chaps
14:10:09 <beelsebob_> and?
14:10:10 <Spark> not technologically advanced enough for satellites
14:10:15 <beelsebob_> lol
14:10:16 <basti_> -g-
14:10:22 * beelsebob_ slays spark
14:11:39 * beelsebob_ meant to slap spark, but slaying is good enough
14:12:17 * boegel takes his Harry Potter book and goes to bed for another chapter
14:12:19 <boegel> g'night folks !
14:12:26 <beelsebob_> g'night
14:12:43 <Heffalump> beelsebob_: most of the UK seems to lack it, if you mean google earth
14:12:54 <Heffalump> Cambridge is a notable exception
14:13:09 <beelsebob_> heffalump, I know... what's odd is that the west of edinburgh is there
14:13:19 <beelsebob_> so they obviously took a snap at some point
14:13:27 <beelsebob_> ...why then didn't they snap the lot
14:14:06 <Heffalump> speed of camera, bandwidth issues to satellite?
14:14:12 <beelsebob_> could be
14:14:34 <beelsebob_> perhaps the orbit just didn't go over central edinburgh
14:14:44 <lispy> wilx: yeah, i saw that clip, taht is funny
14:15:19 <wilx> :)
14:16:29 <Heffalump> anyone around who reads glasgow-haskell-bugs?
14:17:03 <Heffalump> (and/or can help with issues with loading objects into ghci)
15:24:04 <goron> Are finite lists optimized to arrays in GHC?
15:24:27 <Heffalump> no
15:24:28 <TheHunter> no.
15:24:35 <Heffalump> arrays are fixed length, finite lists aren't
15:27:54 <lispy> oh, which reminds me, that's probably the reason that slice :: Int -> Int -> [a] -> [a] probably isn't part of Prelude or List
15:28:02 <lispy> (it was a question the other day)
15:28:45 <goron> So, if I read a file and e.g. get the first 100 characters, and then do (!!), then it will take O(n^2) to get them all?
15:28:55 <Heffalump> !! on what?
15:28:56 <lispy> there is similar functionality for arrays, but since lists might be infinite, maybe people thought it wouldn't be a good idea to define it for lists
15:29:28 <goron> I am talking about finite lists.
15:29:28 <Heffalump> goron: you certainly shouldn't access a list one-element-at-a-time using !!
15:29:37 <goron> Heffalump: No, I know.
15:29:56 <goron> Heffalump: I thought that the compiler could optimize it.
15:30:01 <Heffalump> there is no type system distinction between finite and infinite lists.
15:30:14 <lispy> do { c <- getContents; first100 <- return (take 100 c); return ( first100 !! ???) } something like that?
15:30:18 <Heffalump> And there is a difference between a finite list of arbitrary length and an array of fixed length.
15:30:45 <goron> Heffalump: The finite list is not of arbitrary length, since it's in the source file.
15:30:51 <thou> maybe PackedString would be helpful here?
15:31:15 <Heffalump> goron: well, how is the compiler supposed to know that?
15:32:16 <goron> Heffalump: Well, it could theoretically find out.
15:32:28 <Heffalump> well, it doesn't :-)
15:32:56 <Heffalump> for one thing, lists have nice tail-sharing properties that arrays don't, so even knowing that a given list will be of exactly length 100 isn't enough.
15:33:00 <lispy> how can the compiler determine when a list is infinite?
15:33:24 <goron> lispy: I was talking about finite lists.
15:33:39 <goron> lispy: In some cases it can.
15:33:58 <goron> lispy: e.g. ones= x:ones could be derived.
15:34:29 <goron> But I guess compilers are not *that* advanced yet.
15:34:37 <goron> Most likely there's no demand for it.
15:34:52 <goron> And it's too slow.
15:35:47 <lispy> and if you can't catch some cases, then the best you can do is use the information sometimes and you'll need a conservative safetynet to fall back on for the rest of the time
15:35:49 <goron> Heffalump: something could be a list and have constant time lookup at the sametime.
15:36:27 <goron> Heffalump: So you won't use sharing properties.
15:36:29 <lispy> goron: there are hashtable like things that have that property is that what you are thinking of?
15:36:52 <goron> lispy: no, please don't suggest alternatives(I know my datastructures).
15:37:21 <lispy> goron: i'm not trying to suggest an alternative, i'm trying to figure out when a list has constant time random access :)
15:37:40 <Heffalump> goron: huh?
15:37:53 <TheHunter> goron, in order to be sure it's a good thing to store a finite list in an array, the compiler has to infer a lot of complicated things.
15:38:05 <Heffalump> including whether any code makes use of tail-sharing.
15:38:28 <TheHunter> and including that the whole list is actually used.
15:38:39 <tewk> what does the @ symbol mean in   (\e@(IOException io) ->
15:38:46 * wagle envisions a type that get implemented by the compiler as an array when the "constant-time access" property is requested or derived, and "constant-time insert" when that that property is desired, and maybe other intermediates
15:38:51 <goron> tewk: pattern
15:38:53 <TheHunter> and that the list is used more than once.
15:38:59 <goron> bind variable
15:39:10 <Heffalump> oh yes, and laziness properties, good point.
15:39:13 <goron> somevar@somepattern
15:40:17 <Heffalump> tewk: those are often known as "as" patterns
15:40:25 <goron> Well, so the only reason it's not implemented is because there are other issues that are currently more important?
15:41:02 <TheHunter> a lot (if not most) haskell list code is meant to be intermediate and could ideally be deforested.
15:41:14 <Heffalump> I think the main reason is that it's a long way from being an obvious win.
15:41:18 <TheHunter> So altough the list is long, it only needs constant memory.
15:41:37 <Heffalump> And detecting the situations in which it really is a win is very hard.
15:41:57 <Heffalump> So it's not just a "we haven't got round to it" issue, but a "It's hard to do well" issue.
15:42:15 <Heffalump> you are of course able to use explicit conversions in your code where you want the behaviour.
15:43:06 <goron> Why doesn'
15:43:42 <goron> t everybody agree on some target language for some language and then build together some supercompiler?
15:43:59 <goron> Everybody builds his own VM these days.
15:44:39 <Heffalump> because the optimisations you want depend on both source and target languages, and people have different needs?
15:44:48 <Heffalump> C-- seems like a good attempt at a target language.
15:45:19 <goron> Heffalump: I would say that the real optimizations would be in the machine language code.
15:45:27 <musasabi> Someone contributing a C-- gcc frontend would make many problems go away.
15:45:42 <goron> Heffalump: But a <common-language> => machine language should be standard.
15:45:50 <musasabi> and that should be faster than going via C.
15:46:34 <goron> lambdabot: c--
15:46:47 <goron> Hmm, anybody got an URL?
15:46:55 <goron> For C--?
15:47:02 <TheHunter> @google "c--"
15:47:03 <lambdabot> http://www.c-span.org/
15:47:12 <TheHunter> @google "c minus minus"
15:47:13 <lambdabot> http://www.cminusminus.org/
15:47:28 <goron> I did google "C--", and I didn't find anything.
15:47:41 <goron> weird
15:48:15 <Lemmih> @google C minus minus
15:48:16 <lambdabot> http://www.cminusminus.org/
15:49:00 * Lemmih realizes his lateness.
15:49:09 <Heffalump> goron: on the contrary, most interesting progress in optimisations these days is at higher levels.
15:49:29 <basti_> goron: thats normal, google doesnt see interpunctation
15:49:33 <Heffalump> a lot of C->C transformations are driving the big performance wins in C compilers today, for example
15:49:43 <goron> But why can lambdabot do it then?
15:49:56 <Heffalump> do what?
15:49:59 <basti_> uhm you can type that in a google search form
15:50:00 <Heffalump> @google c
15:50:01 <lambdabot> http://www.c-span.org/
15:50:05 <Heffalump> same result as for "c--"
15:50:06 <basti_> it just stays invisible to google
15:50:12 <goron> I got a different resut.
15:50:15 <goron> er result.
15:50:21 <goron> Maybe I am being censored.
15:50:33 <goron> Paranoid mode on.
15:50:36 * basti_ nods
15:50:39 <Heffalump> more likely you are getting google.nl
15:50:47 <Heffalump> or at least .nl specific results
15:50:53 <basti_> yep.
15:50:53 * Heffalump tends to get .uk specific results
15:51:02 <basti_> google kinda knows where you are
15:51:16 <basti_> i'm even getting marburg specific results sometimes, though i wonder how they do THAT
15:51:19 <goron> Heffalump: yes
15:51:40 <goron> But I want .com results ffs.
15:51:52 <Heffalump> I think there is some URL you can use to force that.
15:52:09 <Heffalump> http://www.google.com/ncr
15:52:26 <goron> ty
15:52:44 <goron> Now, it's the second hit.
15:52:56 <Heffalump> (with a rather obvious link just under the entry box ;-)
15:54:51 <goron> Heffalump: Maybe you need two standard languages.
15:55:00 <goron> Heffalump: One for the high-level stuff.
15:55:21 <Heffalump> high-level stuff is where modern languages mainly differentiate themselves
15:55:30 <Philippa_> low-level stuff is inherantly platform-dependant
15:55:35 <goron> Heffalump: And one to do CPU specific stuff.
15:55:39 <Philippa_> that's practically the definition of low-level
15:55:41 <Heffalump> if you throw too much into one language it becomes unmanageable. E.g. C++.
15:55:57 <Philippa_> so you can't really standardise it as such, at best you can try to standardise a syntax
15:56:05 <Philippa_> ("we'll have a new IO monad for each platform!")
15:56:05 <goron> Well, not realy CPU specific.
15:56:27 <astrolabe> like byte code?
15:56:39 <astrolabe> (java byte code)
15:56:52 <goron> More like that it has a concept of a register and so on. Or more abstract some concept of a "fast cache" and some slower cache ad infinitum.
15:57:07 <goron> So you would have some model of all possible CPU's.
15:57:28 <Heffalump> the more interesting differences between CPUs come from the ISAs
15:57:42 <Heffalump> which, at the low-level, lead to completely different compilation strategies.
15:58:05 <Heffalump> Also, microarchitectural features like branch prediction and load-use penalties are quite significant.
15:58:32 <goron> Heffalump: What are ISAs?
15:58:37 <Heffalump> instruction set architectures
15:58:42 <goron> ok
15:58:47 <Heffalump> e.g. x86, Sparc, PowerPC, Alpha, ARM etc
15:58:59 <Heffalump> goron: how much experience do you have of writing compilers, OOI?
15:59:17 * Heffalump goes shopping, biab
15:59:57 <goron> Heffalump: I have written one extension to a compiler for adding static links. And I wrote a Tiger to almost stackcode compiler.
16:00:18 <Philippa_> so you've not really dealt with multiple ISAs
16:00:24 <goron> Nope
16:00:27 <Heffalump> or with real languages :-)
16:00:39 <Heffalump> (at either high or low level)
16:00:43 <Philippa_> I read a lot of stuff aimed at non-x86 architectures that'd be utterly useless on x86 due to the low register count, for starters
16:00:50 <goron> Heffalump: I did an embedding of XPath in Java.
16:01:03 <SyntaxNinja> for those foreigners in the audience, I will from now on be represented by John Bolton.
16:01:16 <goron> Heffalump: So, I have real experience with Java 1.5 transformations.
16:01:22 <Pseudonym> So we have to call John Bolton if we want to book you?
16:01:25 <Heffalump> ok, there's a good example. How would you combine XPath, Java, Haskell and ML into one tractable high-level language?
16:01:27 <Philippa_> yeah, and I got into an argument that led to my embedding an XPath-like language on an XML-like datatype in haskell in bits and pieces in a usenet thread ;-)
16:01:30 <Pseudonym> Or if we want to sue you?
16:01:41 <Philippa_> Heffalump: some clever monads
16:01:55 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: we won't think any less of you, seeing as you've already got a chipmunk as your president.
16:02:06 <Philippa_> the hard bit'd be mixing strict and lazy stuff appropriately
16:02:06 <SyntaxNinja> Pseudonym: exactly.  and I'm sure he would tell you all to get your act together because you're badly in need of reform. </sarcasm>
16:02:09 <sh10151> that does an injustice to chipmunks
16:02:16 <sh10151> yeah I never get that
16:02:16 <goron> Heffalump: Depends on how inefficient it may be.
16:02:28 <Heffalump> goron: but your point is to make a common language for optimisations.
16:02:34 <Pseudonym> Heffalump: Do you do hen's nights?
16:02:40 <Heffalump> So crippling yourself by starting from a really inefficient base is not helpful.
16:02:45 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: you what?
16:03:04 <goron> Heffalump: Well, you could e.g. compiler everything to Turing machine.
16:03:07 <Pseudonym> Just wondering what we could book you for.
16:03:08 <goron> er compile
16:03:09 <sh10151> it's such an emergency that we haven't had a permanent ambassador to the UN for six months, so Bush uses the recess appointment to elevate someone who thinks no one should have any ambassadors to the UN ever?
16:03:12 <Heffalump> the UN is in a bit of a mess, but having the US tell it what to do is rather rich.
16:03:13 <sh10151> hello?
16:03:16 <sh10151> mcfly?
16:03:22 <Philippa_> goron: you mean throw away /all/ useful information?
16:03:41 <Philippa_> I mean, that's like hashing all the optimisation-relevant data and trying to optimise based on the hash
16:03:46 <Heffalump> however, I am really going shopping now.
16:04:07 <goron> Philippa_: I understand what you mean. Well, theoretically it would be better.
16:04:17 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: word.
16:04:19 <SyntaxNinja> l8r
16:04:38 <Pseudonym> Oh, sorry.
16:04:45 <Pseudonym> Duh.
16:04:53 * Pseudonym was talking to Heffalump and meant to talk to Syntax
16:05:01 <Pseudonym> All those weak and unfunny jokes for naught.
16:05:02 * Pseudonym subs
16:05:05 * Pseudonym sobs, too
16:05:33 <Pseudonym> This is too early in the morning.  I need caffeine, clearly.
16:07:17 <Pseudonym> I find it really amusing that the world seems to be converging on ISAs which have very little to do with any of the recent research on compilation.
16:07:38 <goron> Is the run-time of C-- optional?
16:08:58 <basti_> ISA?
16:09:13 <Pseudonym> <Heffalump> instruction set architectures
16:09:18 <basti_> ah
16:09:47 <basti_> goodnight, though.
16:09:48 <basti_> :)
16:10:59 <astrolabe> The first column of my source file seems to be significant ( like the column of the first token after a let.  Could someone explain why please?
16:11:00 <goron> Is reading TaPL worth the effort?
16:11:09 <gzl> I thought so.
16:11:21 <gzl> obviously, it depends on what you want to do.
16:11:37 <lispy> astrolabe: haskell uses whitespace for syntax
16:11:49 <lispy> astrolabe: is that possibly what you're experiencing?
16:12:04 <goron> E.g. to create more advanced type constructions then I do now.
16:12:12 <goron> er than
16:12:37 <astrolabe> lispy, thanks I understand that for lets and dos, but why should the first column of my file be significant?
16:12:40 <gzl> i'm not sure what you mean by that. it gives you a good understanding of how type systems in functional langauges are designed
16:12:57 <gzl> and the underlying theory of typed lambda calculus
16:13:19 <goron> gzl: Well, e.g. using Rank-n types in GHC should be easier after I read the book.
16:13:25 <Philippa_> astrolabe: is the first token "module" by any chance?
16:13:35 <Philippa_> if so, consider where the opening and closing braces for the module go
16:13:53 <astrolabe> Philipa, it isn't, unless it is implicitly?
16:13:56 <gzl> I've never used rank-n types in GHC, so I dunno.
16:14:08 <Pseudonym> astrolabe: Do you have a (cut down) example?
16:14:12 <lispy> astrolabe: i don't understand what you mean by column
16:14:14 <astrolabe> That does sound likely though.
16:14:20 * Heffalump returns
16:14:26 <Philippa_> astrolabe: it is, yeah
16:14:27 <Pseudonym> That was quick.
16:14:31 <goron> gzl: does it talk about type classes?
16:14:43 * Philippa_ had real problems with the layout rule 'til she read the definition of it in the Report
16:14:55 <Philippa_> I really wish tutorials wouldn't handwave it without quoting it somewhere too
16:14:55 <astrolabe> f = let tom = \x -> if null x then 0
16:14:55 <astrolabe>                               else tom(tail x) + 1
16:14:55 <astrolabe>  in tom
16:15:07 <lispy> astrolabe: if the vertical bar is the beginning of the line then are you having problems with things like | foo = 4
16:15:12 <Philippa_> my IRC client uses a proportional font 'mafraid :-)
16:15:18 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: yes, having a large supermarket 2 minutes walk away that is deserted at just past midnight is ideal :-)
16:15:30 <astrolabe> if the 'in tom' starts in the first column, it doesn't work.
16:15:44 <gzl> goron: not extensively. ATTaPL may discuss them more extensively, I dunno
16:15:48 <lispy> astrolabe: yes, that's the layout rule
16:16:04 <goron> gzl: what's ATTaPL?
16:16:05 <Pseudonym> Heffalump: Also, apparently not needing to buy very much is ideal.
16:16:09 <lispy> astrolabe: you're expected to line up the 'in' with the 'let'
16:16:17 <Pseudonym> goron: It's TaPL 2: The Revenge
16:16:20 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: that partly goes with it being close :-)
16:16:22 <gzl> goron: the sequel
16:16:24 <Philippa_> ATTaPL doesn't cover type classes
16:16:29 <gzl> ok, well, there you go.
16:16:32 <goron> gzl: that's what I guessed.
16:16:41 <gzl> goron: TaPL is based more on ML than Haskell
16:16:45 <astrolabe> lispy, oh thanks.  Looks as though I might need to check the report, as Phillipa hinted.
16:16:51 <gzl> and more on the theory
16:16:59 <goron> gzl: I don't really care about the language used. I care more for theory.
16:17:00 <Philippa_> gzl: that's a bit misleading, the ML's only relevant for the implementations of the type systems
16:17:03 <Heffalump> I think self-checkout helps too.
16:17:12 <gzl> yeah, I know
16:17:20 <Philippa_> ATTaPL does have a nice chapter on HM(X) (a generalised Hindley-Milner system)
16:17:31 <gzl> goron: well, it's largely a theory book
16:17:41 <Pseudonym> HM(X) is basically ML's type system, isn't it?
16:17:43 <thou> astrolabe: http://haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html#sect4.6
16:17:48 <Philippa_> and it'll put you in a much better position to understand the papers on type classes
16:17:51 <gzl> it mentions type classes in passing (literally the end of chapter notes in one chapter)
16:18:01 <gzl> in the chapter on type reconstruction
16:18:03 <Philippa_> Pseudonym: yeah, in the general sense in that it covers much of the ocaml stuff too
16:18:07 <Pseudonym> Right.
16:18:25 <goron> Philippa_: Do you have a name or URL of a paper that's really hard?
16:18:27 <Philippa_> plain HM's the ML-before-it-branched one
16:18:27 * Pseudonym has read a couple of Martin Sulzmann/Peter Stuckey papers on HM(X)
16:18:34 <gzl> goron: maybe you should just look at the book and see if it has what you want...
16:18:43 <Philippa_> I've tried to read papers and found I couldn't follow the interesting bits properly
16:18:48 <Philippa_> the ATTaPL chapter was useful in that regard
16:18:51 * Pseudonym nods
16:19:09 <Philippa_> now I need to code some of it up. And think about rank-n extensions and the like to see whether it works and gives me a good framework for what I want to do
16:19:27 <Philippa_> rank-n specifically because it's not just constraint stuff
16:19:36 * goron already registered for an optional course, but isn't really sure whether to actually follow it. 
16:19:55 <gzl> no, I mean, why don't you go pick up the physical book and flip through it?
16:20:21 <Philippa_> it might cost money to get the chance?
16:20:24 <goron> gzl: I don't think the book is in 50km of my current location in a store.
16:20:33 <gzl> ok
16:20:34 <Pseudonym> Of all the type extensions to HM, I think arbitrary rank types are probably the most important.
16:20:44 <Pseudonym> Because just about every other extension can be implemented in terms of that.
16:20:46 <Philippa_> if you want theory, just get the book
16:20:51 <astrolabe> lispy: I don't see where it says I should line-up the in with the let.
16:20:53 <Pseudonym> Well, that plus the second-order stuff.
16:21:05 <Philippa_> second-order?
16:21:12 <Pseudonym> System F.
16:21:20 <gzl> goron: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/contents.ps
16:21:21 <Pseudonym> Second-order lambda calculus.
16:21:33 * Pseudonym is having trouble expressing herself before caffeine
16:21:34 <Philippa_> ah. IOW, rank-n with impredicativity
16:21:54 <gzl> herself?
16:22:03 <gzl> am I confusing two people?
16:22:05 <lispy> astrolabe: i don't know the exact details of the layout rule (I don't like it) but lining them up is what was recommended at me
16:22:06 <goron> gzl: I already saw the contents.
16:22:09 <Pseudonym> gzl: Lame attempt a self-referential humour.
16:22:19 <gzl> ok, good
16:22:21 <gzl> goron: ok
16:22:39 <goron> gzl: thanks for your efforts to look it up, though. :)
16:22:43 <gzl> np
16:24:49 <Beelsebob> evening all, again
16:25:53 <astrolabe> Ah, I'm getting it.  If I don't have 'module', it inserts 'module Main(main) where', and then what Phillipa said applies.
16:29:27 <lispy> astrolabe: 'module Main where' (or something besides main depending on context, is usually a good thing to have.
16:29:45 <lispy> ghci is pretty good about not needing it, but sometimes things are smoother with it
16:35:51 <astrolabe> lispy: the report says 'an abbreviated form of module, consisting only of the module body is permitted.  If this used, the header is assumed to be 'module Main(main) where'.  If the first lexeme in the abbreviated module is not a {, then the layout rule applies to the top level of the module.
16:36:04 <astrolabe> Which I think answers my question :)
16:55:55 <lispy> astrolabe: cool
16:56:35 <lispy> oh, so you could put the entrie module inside {} to avoid the layout rules....interesting
16:57:04 <lispy> then maybe block uncomment in emacs would work the way i want
17:03:38 <wagle> whoa..  eclipse REALLY doesnt like the scheme-interpreter-in-java i wrote in 1998...
17:04:18 <lispy> wagle: er?
17:07:21 <lispy> wagle: aren't you glad it's write once, port to the latest version and regussion test every 6 months, run anywhere?
17:07:57 <lispy> s/months,/months, and /
17:08:00 <wagle> definitely
17:08:15 <lispy> i love that about java!
17:08:52 <Spark> heh
17:09:18 <Pseudonym> Write Once, Debug Everywhere
17:09:20 <dons> heh, its almost as portable as C!
17:09:46 <Pseudonym> Java programmers do it once, do it anywhere!
17:09:57 <lispy> dons: almost, but then the JVM for j2ee only runs on Solaris, Linux, Windows, OS X and at most 2 other platforms.
17:10:24 <dons> oh true. i have to run java under linux emulation on my openbsd machine :/ write once, don't run most places
17:10:26 <lispy> and we know that C runs everywhere there is unix and then some
17:10:38 <Beelsebob> lol
17:10:47 <lispy> dons: wow, that's too bad :(
17:11:02 <Beelsebob> lispy: yeh, C works everywhere... with some tweaking
17:11:08 <Beelsebob> Java takes more tweaking
17:11:26 <lispy> gcc may someday correct that
17:11:49 <Beelsebob> maybe... gcc is pretty pants at the moment
17:11:50 <lispy> but if you've actually tried to use gcj you'll know it's not substitute for a proper javac/jvm
17:12:04 <lispy> Beelsebob: exactly :(
17:12:19 <Beelsebob> although it's not bad on PPC now
17:12:29 <Beelsebob> 4.0 gave some really serious speed ups
17:12:34 <lispy> and sun's implemenation is not actually free software, so that's no good.  I want to support freesoftware when i develop stuff
18:06:05 <frederik> how much work would it take to fix the bug where "ghc --make" relinks things even when an up-to-date linked object is available?
18:06:34 * Heffalump works around that by using ghc -M and Makefiles
18:06:54 <frederik> but it makes 'cabal' annoying to use for building
18:07:35 <frederik> if one has a lot of executables
18:07:47 <Heffalump> true
18:11:09 <Beelsebob> frederik: just use hmake?
18:13:19 <Igloo> It was talked about on the list recently, but I can't remember if SM listed it as one of the things fixed in the performance week
18:14:51 <TheHunter> has anybody got a _very_ recent ghc build and is willing to try a small program?
18:16:11 <TheHunter> _very_ recent meaning < 11 hours old...
18:17:13 <Beelsebob> In that case I have an old build
18:17:34 <Beelsebob> but I do have a working hat-detect :) http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
18:18:35 <Heffalump> grrrr.
18:18:42 <TheHunter> i think the JaffaCake's bugfix doesn't cover all cases, but before bugging him again, i'd like to test it.
18:18:45 <Beelsebob> grrr?
18:18:47 * Heffalump gives up on following the twisty maze that is loading external objects in ghci
18:20:42 <TheHunter> basically pipe(2) sucks because there's no option to create only fds greater than some value.
18:21:32 <dons> TheHunter, I'll fork off a nightly build now
18:21:43 <dons> last night's build missed the patch by an hour or so
18:22:34 <TheHunter> yeah, I noticed it must have been pretty close.
18:23:15 <dons> hmm, maybe it made it. i'll check the cvs repo
18:25:11 <dons> nope. didn't make it in. i'll start a quick build now
18:28:27 <TheHunter> what's a "quick build"?
18:29:24 <Igloo> An oxymoron, in ghc's case  :-)
18:30:12 <Lemmih> heh
18:30:13 * TheHunter wonders how long it takes to get a new ghc after changing one line in the source
18:30:16 <dons> just a nightly build, but leave off stage 3, no nofib or testsuite run. should take about 40 mins or so (?)
18:30:29 <Igloo> ISTR it takes about 5 mins to run make after changing nothing
18:30:45 <dons> oh, just one line in the src may take only 20-30 seconds.. plus 20-30 seconds reliking ghc
18:30:49 <dons> relinking
18:30:53 <dons> 5 mins!
18:31:00 <Igloo> Hmm, perhaps I misremember then
18:31:19 <dons> and out-of-the-box src dist can be built in around 20 mins on my box, with the right build flags and a ramdisk :}
18:31:23 <Igloo> Or perhaps you just have a faster machine
18:31:33 <dons> yeah, probably. 2.4Ghz P4
18:31:39 <dons> lambdabot's home :}
18:31:47 <Igloo> Hmmm, that should be fairly comparable
18:32:22 <TheHunter> can building take advantage of multiple cpus?
18:32:35 <dons> yes, make -j N sometimes works
18:32:51 <dons> it really flys along when doing an .hc build with gcc
18:33:27 <dons> ok, its started building stage 1 now.
18:33:49 <Igloo> real    1m1.667s
18:33:49 <Igloo> user    0m35.372s
18:33:49 <Igloo> sys     0m10.282s
18:34:03 <dons> an nop `make' ?
18:34:08 <Igloo> yup
18:34:13 <dons> heh
18:34:22 <dons> "recursive make considered harmful"
18:34:29 <Igloo> Indeed
18:35:01 <monochrom> yeah, should use goto in makefiles
18:36:30 * TheHunter tries to build ghc.
18:36:38 <TheHunter> not on my computer though, that'd be much too slow.
18:36:50 <Pseudonym> Papers entitled "considered harmful" considered harmful
18:37:00 <monochrom> hahaha
18:37:15 * dons attempted a cluster build of ghc using pvmake, didn't get too far.
18:37:19 <Pseudonym> The ACM won't accept papers entitled "X Considered Harmful".
18:37:33 <dons> however, yi built in 4s on the cluster with pvmmake
18:37:44 <Pseudonym> BTW, I think "Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct" is a paper title worthy of Wadler himself.
18:37:48 <TheHunter> can I build it using ghc-6.2.2?
18:37:55 <dons> yi?
18:37:57 <dons> or ghc?
18:38:03 <Korollary> Pseudonym: Yes
18:38:09 <dons> answer is yes, either way
18:38:21 <TheHunter> great! (ghc)
18:38:36 <Heffalump> woooo
18:38:45 * Heffalump gets antibuddha working in ghci
18:39:15 <Heffalump> and loading perl modules that use dynamic objects themselves
18:39:24 <Leimy> Need a "Practical Haskell Programming" book :)
18:39:43 <Leimy> with lots of "recipes" :)
18:40:02 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: well, it does sort of draw on the Theorems for Free kind of idea
18:40:22 <dons> I have thought that a practical haskell book is a good idea
18:40:31 <dons> along the lines of the perl books
18:40:42 * Igloo should try to follow up on http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=294481 as that might have the potential to fix such problems
18:40:56 <Leimy> dons: that's basically what I'm talking about
18:41:32 <dons> maybe we should start one on the wiki?
18:41:39 <Leimy> could be interesting :)
18:41:43 <dons> sketch out the topics that should be covered, and start writing code
18:41:53 <Leimy> I've got a bit of haskell code I use almost daily
18:41:56 <Leimy> but I know it's not very good
18:42:07 <dons> i'm interested, as I tutor a `software construction' course about shell/perl/sed
18:42:10 <TheHunter> what should N be in make -jN if I have 2 cpus at my disposal?
18:42:21 <dons> and i'm planning on slipping haskell into the mix when the lecturer isn't looking ;)
18:42:36 <dons> 5-6?
18:42:37 <Heffalump> oh, yes, I had a problem with pthread too
18:42:48 <Heffalump> and it didn't like me trying to add 'c' to the libraries list either :-)
18:43:00 <dons> I know 3 seems good with a hyperthreaded single cpu
18:43:18 <TheHunter> and 6G of RAM...
18:43:22 <dons> oh my!
18:43:39 <dons> up the heap too then, and forget about GC
18:43:39 <TheHunter> universities do have money.
18:43:45 <dons> -H256M or more
18:43:53 <TheHunter> as a make option?
18:44:02 <dons> in build.mk, place:
18:44:33 <dons> SRC_HC_OPTS += -O -H64m -fasm
18:44:54 <dons> well, you substitute your own values, this is just from my nightly build
18:44:57 <Leimy> Once my Good_Haskell:Sucky_Haskell ratio improves I'd consider submitting code to such a wiki
18:45:13 <dons> Leimy, if you want to open up a page, I'll start making notes on it
18:45:29 * Heffalump finds out a bit more about linker scripts. Ugh. Is it in principle possible that all libraries will eventually become linker scripts?
18:45:31 <Leimy> where should I star that?
18:45:33 <dons> maybe put a list of the topics you think should be covered.
18:45:48 <Leimy> ah for a Practical Haskell book? :)
18:45:49 <dons> @where hawiki
18:45:50 <lambdabot> http://haskell.org/hawiki/
18:46:03 <dons> hehe. lambbdabot has to fight with ghc for cpu time
18:46:18 <Heffalump> make it multithreaded!
18:46:27 <TheHunter> ./ghc/compiler/ilxGen/tests/build.mk ?
18:46:31 <Heffalump> (multi{OS}threaded that is)
18:46:35 <dons> mk/build.mk
18:46:49 <dons> lambdabot is multi-threaded, but not OS threaded, iirc
18:47:08 <dons> ok, stage 1 done
18:47:14 <dons> entering libraries
18:47:37 <TheHunter> i'll try SRC_HC_OPTS += -O -H1024m -fasm, make -j3
18:47:44 <Leimy> dons: I'm going to have to learn to use hawiki first it seems :)
18:47:47 <Heffalump> making it OS threaded wouldn't help it use more CPU
18:48:08 <Heffalump> (as with any other Haskell program compiled with ghc 6.4 or before)
18:48:10 <Korollary> what are you guys trying to build ?
18:48:11 <dons> no. i was wondering what you were implying?
18:48:37 <Heffalump> nothing really :-)
18:48:45 <dons> Korollary, there's a ghc build race :)
18:48:50 <dons> with 1 entrant
18:48:59 <Heffalump> although it would be interesting to see what can be done in the way of background computation once the new SMP ghc is ready
18:49:02 <Korollary> dons: It's like pole vault, eh ?
18:49:20 <Heffalump> though actually I guess it could do that anyway.
18:49:42 <dons> Heffalump, I know! it can calculate all shortest paths for grid references in chicago's hyde park area
18:49:51 * Korollary is wondering if he has enough gas in the tank to go for a PhD in CS...
18:50:26 <dons> doh. me loses build race by forgetting to turn of split objs, which don't work on my box
18:51:55 <TheHunter> you haven't lost yet, i found out I only have 2G. 6G is the other box (with 4cpus), but maybe somebody would care if I build ghc on there.
18:52:41 <dons> building stage 1 over :/
18:52:59 <Korollary> y0 lispy_
18:53:58 <lispy_> Korollary: hi

18:54:45 <Leimy> not bad :)
18:54:49 <Lemmih> Urk. Time to sleep.
18:55:36 <dons> time to catch a bus
18:55:49 <lispy> dons: that was me 45 minutes ago!
18:55:54 <lispy> oh, actually an hour ago
18:56:08 <lispy> @time sydne
18:56:09 <lambdabot>  Tuesday, August 2, 2005 at 11:57:12 AM EST

18:56:12 <lambdabot>  Tuesday, August 2, 2005 at 11:57:15 AM EST
18:56:27 <lispy> ah, lambdabot autocorreting me
18:56:32 <lispy> you're so nice :)
18:56:50 <Heffalump> dons: hah, a good implementation of that would be fast enough that it wouldn't need to be backgrounded :-)
18:57:36 <Lemmih> Bzzt. I so don't grok the native code generator.
18:58:10 <lispy> Korollary: you should definitely check out OSU first hand and meet students and find out if they like it...(if you having doubts about having enough gas)
18:58:14 <Leimy> dons: http://haskell.org/hawiki/PracticalHaskell
18:59:31 <lispy> hmm...i wish the bus that goes from the station to my house would run late more often.  It has a tendency to leave the station right when i'm getting off the rail
18:59:47 <lispy> "No, wait, come back!"
19:05:33 <Korollary> Leimy: I don't know about Profit, but ??? looks interesting.
19:05:40 <Leimy> heh
19:05:55 <Korollary> Program samples would be nice
19:06:23 <Korollary> but who cares about beginners :)
19:08:21 <Leimy> well I do
19:08:24 <Leimy> since I still am one :)
19:10:16 <TheHunter> hey, thebug
19:11:12 <thebug> why hellos
19:11:49 <TheHunter> how's your trip to europe?
19:12:06 <thebug> just got back about 4 hours ago :) quite fun
19:14:45 <Leimy> http://haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
19:14:58 <Leimy> Anyone want to take a look at that and tell me how much my Haskell-fu sucks?
19:15:05 <thebug> TheHunter: when were you headed over here?
19:15:39 <TheHunter> i've been here for about one and and a half weeks.
19:15:52 <thebug> ah
19:17:45 <thebug> well, I'm about to pass out for tonight but I'm sure I'll be back later this week :)
19:18:02 <thebug> TheHunter: hope you're having fun checking out EL ;)
19:18:24 <TheHunter> oki, have a good night.
19:18:41 <TheHunter> i do, it's pretty easy to get adjusted to the american lifestyle
19:18:43 <Korollary> Leimy: It looks fine.  It's mostly io anyway.
19:19:03 <Leimy> Korollary: yes... it's a lot of that :)
19:19:12 <Leimy> Korollary: but the function that bugs me most is "trim"
19:19:40 <Korollary> Leimy: I think it's getSockPart.
19:19:53 <Leimy> yeah that one sucks too
19:19:54 <Korollary> Leimy: Why don't you use a regexp ?
19:20:15 <Leimy> Korollary: too much of a newb to know how to use it :)
19:20:19 <Leimy> in Haskell that is
19:20:46 <Korollary> Leimy: if you know how to use waitForProcess , you are qualified to use regexps :)
19:21:26 <Leimy> sure but I apparently hadn't read that part of the Haskell Prelude or whatever library I was pulling this stuff out of at the time :)
19:21:37 <Leimy> I use haskell once every few months
19:21:41 <Leimy> then I put it aside
19:21:52 <Leimy> If I knew it better I'd use it more often :)
19:22:31 <TheHunter> oh, trim is fine.
19:22:40 <Leimy> isn't it a bit wasteful?
19:23:38 <TheHunter> it's a little bit wasteful, but you'll usually use it with small strings.
19:24:18 <TheHunter> lambdabot's source defines its dropSpace function in the same way.
19:24:54 <Korollary> And efficient version would be a nice addition to Prelude, imho
19:24:58 <Korollary> s/and/an
19:26:23 <TheHunter> it changes the end of a list, this always as bad performance consequences, therefore you shouldn't care too much about the extra traversals.
19:26:32 <TheHunter> *has
19:27:04 <lispy_> also, you shouldn't care about performance unless it's shown to be a problem
19:27:11 <Leimy> yeah I agree
19:27:16 <Leimy> it just looks horrid to me
19:27:25 <Leimy> reverse a string... drop spaces
19:27:28 <Leimy> reverse the output
19:27:29 <Leimy> do it again
19:27:31 <Korollary> Leimy: It's as simple as "Text.Regex.mkRegex "([0-9]+)-([a-zA-Z]+).txt(.gz)*"
19:27:32 <Leimy> has to be a better way
19:29:49 <lispy_> Leimy: you might be able to use attribute grammars to traverse it more efficiently
19:32:15 * Leimy runs to get his Chinese food
19:33:32 <Beelsebob> bleh... chinese food
19:35:03 <lispy_> sounds good to me
19:35:14 * Beelsebob is alergic to MSG
19:35:16 <lispy_> actually, pizza is what sounds good to me, but it will make me sick for sure :)
19:35:28 <Beelsebob> heh... other way round for me
19:35:33 <lispy_> Beelsebob: i thought japanese food was more likely to have MSG
19:35:41 <Beelsebob> that too
19:35:49 <Beelsebob> but chinese food isn't worth the risk
19:39:02 <lispy_> MSG doesn't bother me, but it's probably worth avoiding.   But, having said that, i eat asian food as often as i can
19:39:27 <lispy_> eating a lot of rice is good for my digestive system, and i usually really like the favors too
19:40:16 <lispy_> for some reason, deep fried and greasy food give me really bad stomach aches
19:40:27 <Beelsebob> yeh, same here
19:40:44 <Beelsebob> except that I go for the curries
19:40:54 <Beelsebob> (Indian ones usually)
19:40:59 <lispy_> ah, cool
19:41:05 <lispy_> i have limited exposure to indian food
19:41:30 <Beelsebob> my mum cooks the stuff with avengance, and I caught the bug
19:41:31 <lispy_> i've enjoyed what i've had, but i don't feel like i've had a lot of different things
19:41:39 <lispy_> heh
19:42:29 <fnord123> indian food is awesome
19:42:40 <Beelsebob> decent indian food, yes
19:42:43 <fnord123> bleh good food is good food. it's all awesome!
19:43:19 <Beelsebob> in fact... the only really really fatty thing I can eat is `butter chicken' as madhur jaffery describes it
19:43:42 <Beelsebob> that mostly involves a tub of butter, and a tub of creme... oh, and some tomatoes and tandouri chicken
19:43:47 <Beelsebob> cream*
19:44:22 <TheHunter> dons, done!
20:03:41 * juhp tries ghci on x86_64 linux :)
20:03:43 <juhp> yow
20:10:35 <Leimy> no MSG here :)
20:10:53 <Leimy> love teh indian food too
20:12:37 <TheHunter> i can't attach files in the sf bug-tracker unless i'm logged in, right?
20:14:31 <Leimy> no idea
20:24:28 <Leimy> wow
20:25:16 <dons> TheHunter, me too
20:25:59 <dons> 1hr, 21 mins to do stage 1, 2 and libraries
20:26:13 <dons> oh, way=p and normal, that slowed it down muchly
20:26:23 <dons> now, lets see if runplugs works
20:26:57 <TheHunter> runplugs should work.
20:27:15 <dons> works for you?
20:28:19 <TheHunter> yes, but http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&atid=108032&aid=1249226&group_id=8032
20:28:32 <dons> I see
20:29:24 <TheHunter> what where the people who designed the c library smoking, btw?
20:29:47 <dons> it's pretty nuts
20:31:14 <Leimy> which parts? :)
20:31:35 <Leimy> there's a lot of functions which were historically bad ideas :)
20:43:35 <lispy> ah, history, if it's not for repeting, then what good is it?
20:51:03 <jewel> it's called evolution
20:51:22 <sh10151> what
20:51:33 <sh10151> standard c library?
20:51:44 <fnord123> hey all. im making some changes to a project build system and getting errors (unsiprisingly). the problems I have are that a module isn't being found - though the module looks correct and the import statement looks correct
20:52:09 <fnord123> but when i use ghc's -v flag it says its deleting all the  tmp files right before this particular module lookup.
20:52:16 <sh10151> speaketh not so cavalierly about St. Ritchie
21:00:17 <lispy> fnord123: please paste the relevant parts to a paste bin so we can look at it :)
21:01:33 <fnord123> which one do you prefer? paste.lisp.org?
21:02:10 <lispy> that's a good one, although it has isses with some internet proxies
21:09:47 <lisppaste2> fnord123 pasted "make problems..." at http://paste.lisp.org/display/10422
21:26:41 <thou> fnord123: did you mean to have Darcs/DarcsArgument.lhs, but 'module Darcs.DarcsArguments'?
21:26:52 <thou> fnord123: (Argument[s])?
21:28:02 <thou> fnord123: ah, nevermind, i see from the error message that it is actually Arguments.lhs
21:29:10 <fnord123> if I make -k, I see a few other files wibble on about DarcsUtils.lhs, which leads me to believe it's the main culprit
21:40:16 <sproingie> hm.  are there any good examples of really stateful haskell apps other than lambdabot?
21:40:34 <Pseudonym> Does darcs count as stateful?
21:40:42 <sproingie> lambdabot has persistent state, so it's not really the state juggling i'm looking for
21:40:44 <Korollary> Yi is stateful
21:40:46 <Korollary> all the way
21:41:07 <sproingie> actually darcs is quite functional, more so than most vc apps ... everything's a composition of patches
21:41:36 <sproingie> ooh yi ... a text editor is definitely what i'd call stateful
21:42:02 <Pseudonym> Ah, I didn't realise you were talking about in-memory state.
21:42:48 <sproingie> yeah, it's one thing that still scares me about haskell
21:43:07 <sproingie> one big piece of global state, i can see how that's done
21:43:16 <sproingie> but juggling lots of bits of state confounds me
21:45:40 <Korollary> it actually works out just fine imho
21:48:21 <sproingie> i imagine.  i'm just a novice
21:48:45 <sproingie> got this app from work i've been porting to c++ and i'm thinking it'd be great to try it in haskell
21:49:17 <Korollary> how big is it ?
21:49:19 <sproingie> except it's implemented pretty stateful right now, and i dont want to try porting AND radically changing the algorithm
21:49:27 <sproingie> oh it's tiny.  400 lines of C++
21:50:02 <Korollary> if you want to, you can in fact maintain the very same structure
21:50:18 <sproingie> unfortunately all really proprietary stuff, i wish i could share the code and get pointers
21:50:51 <sproingie> not so much proprietary as in it's novel, but revealing of methods and so forth
21:51:15 <Korollary> i.e., work
21:51:17 <Korollary> heh
21:51:26 <Korollary> I was thinking the same thing a while ago
21:51:36 <Korollary> reimplementing the same algorithm in haskell
21:51:56 <Korollary> and mine was way over 400 lines
21:52:03 <sproingie> how do you mean maintain the same structure?
21:52:21 <Korollary> haskell does support quite a bit of imperative programming
21:52:35 <sproingie> this iterates through one list about 400 times, updating another list each time (it's an iterative solution)
21:52:39 <lament> but isn't imperative programming in haskell kind of like cheating?
21:52:58 <sproingie> i suppose i could have it recreate the list every time through, but it's a lot of data to be slinging around
21:53:02 <Korollary> it's not cheating, it's consentual masochism :)
21:53:29 <Korollary> nah it's not bad
21:53:58 <Korollary> if you want, I can post 90 lines of c++ and 90 lines of haskell code side by side doing the same thing
21:53:59 <sproingie> i need to learn my functional data structures i guess, keep from having to write an entire updated list
21:54:09 <sproingie> that'd be nifty
21:54:28 <Korollary> are you familiar with monads and io, though ?
21:54:57 <sproingie> basically.  i know the basic idea, but i'm short of non-contrived examples of state monad use
21:55:10 <Korollary> ok
21:55:56 <lisppaste2> Korollary pasted "perm2 cpp" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/10425
21:55:57 <sproingie> that's been my problem, is most example code is so contrived, i lack context for how to fit it in to a bigger program
21:56:27 <lisppaste2> Korollary pasted "perm2 haskell" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/10426
21:56:38 <Korollary> check out those two
21:58:34 <Korollary> it's an array based algorithm that generates permutations.
21:59:37 <Korollary> Johnson-Trotter Shuffle
22:01:25 <sproingie> hm.  the haskell version seems to never return
22:01:43 <Korollary> you need to compile with -O, heh
22:02:22 <Korollary> I suspect that ghc has a bug
22:03:11 <sproingie> there it goes
22:04:12 <sproingie> what's unsafeFreeze and unsafeThaw do?
22:04:45 <Korollary> they let you treat a mutable array as if it's an immutable array without making a copy.
22:05:45 <Korollary> that speeds things up a bit. I wrote this for benchmarking purposes.
22:07:08 <sproingie> huh.  this is yet another different way to do state
22:07:32 <sproingie> usually i see Control.Monad.State or StateT or whatnot
22:08:24 <Korollary> yeah this algorithm is array based.
22:08:40 <Korollary> minimum number of updates between two transitions.
22:09:57 <sproingie> the problem i have is almost vector-based, but my math skills stop at discrete maths
22:10:22 * sproingie knows someone on another channel that's a wizard with k, which is based on apl
22:10:23 <Korollary> vector as in vectors in algebra ?
22:10:32 <sproingie> but K just makes my eyeballs bleed
22:11:24 <sproingie> well, vectors as in doing lots of column selects based on a simple aggregate
22:13:08 <sproingie> basically, trying to find optimal weights of rules.  takes a current maximum rule value based on some magic formula that we tweak, tweaks the rule, sees how that affects the other rules, weight down if necessary, repeat until stable
22:14:02 <sproingie> if it were written in k, it'd probably run in an instant
22:15:32 <blackdog> dons: around?
22:16:20 <sproingie> anyway, it does a lot of simple parsing of files.  i was using spirit for this on the c++ side, but i'm struck by how ugly it all is
22:20:56 <lament> speaking of bleeding eyes...
22:20:58 <sproingie> yeah k almost loooks like that
22:21:58 <sproingie> group:{[t;k;f;o].+(k,{`$($x),"_",$y}'[o;f];,/(k;f) {(. z)[t y]. x}[link[t;t;k]]''`last,,o)}
22:22:23 * Korollary swallows some pills and forgets about the last line
22:22:32 <sproingie> as one commenter put it: "Christ... a language that makes perl look like a Hemingway novel. I wouldn't have thought it possible."
22:23:08 <Korollary> somebody was really short on lexemes of multiple letters.
22:23:21 <sproingie> its heritage is APL
22:23:29 <Korollary> I read about those languages
22:23:38 <Korollary> and the funky keyboard
22:23:46 <sproingie> k doesn't require any funky symbols
22:24:31 <sproingie> APL's true successor is J.  K is more data-oriented, less numerics
22:25:04 <sproingie> it's what kdb is written in,  which is a realtime database
22:25:07 <sproingie> www.kx.com
22:25:57 <sproingie> still, i could have used a little more verbosity
22:26:30 <sproingie> tho i'm told its syntax is regular enough that it could easily unparse to sexps.  that'd be a neat project
23:00:08 <dons> blackdog, hey
23:04:29 <Korollary> wow. http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~shemeas/juks/images/even-odd.png
23:04:39 <Korollary> lazy, visual, functional language heh
23:04:58 <lament> ugly
23:05:22 <Korollary> yeah. I don't really understand the push behind the so-called "visual" languages...
23:06:07 <lament> well, this one is too ugly even by teh usual standards for visual languages
23:06:35 <lament> it's the visual equivalent of lisp :)
23:06:52 <Korollary> there's some scheme heritage actually
23:07:06 <Korollary> the original post states that it's properly tail recursive a la scheme, etc.
23:07:17 <lament> yes
23:07:22 <lament> that explains the regularity
23:08:09 <Korollary> drawing software is like sniffing music, sometimes.
23:08:20 <lament> i dunno
23:08:26 <lament> i really like the concept of visual languages
23:08:32 <lisppaste2> fnord123 annotated #10422 with "solution" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/10422#1
23:08:59 <lament> i'm not sure if it's possible to have a practical (or even usable) visual language but it would certainly be neat :)
23:09:36 <Korollary> I think such a language would significantly different constructs and semantics
23:09:42 <lament> well
23:09:45 <lament> there's always vhdl
23:09:48 <lament> and electronics
23:09:52 <lament> and all that stuff
23:10:01 <lament> which even predates computers
23:10:15 <lament> and is actually used
23:10:37 <lament> people just don't normally call electronic circuit diagrams "programs"
23:10:43 <Korollary> because they are not
23:10:49 <lament> no?
23:10:54 <Korollary> nope
23:11:01 <lament> why not?
23:11:20 <lament> electronic circuit diagrams are written in a data-oriented, visual programming language.
23:11:53 <Korollary> there are two kinds: your typical analog circuitry is just a physical "system". It is described by a language, but the language is not turing complete.
23:12:09 <lament> mmm
23:12:46 <lament> i don't know enough electronics to argue that
23:12:48 <Korollary> and there are digital circuits, which are state machines and are turing complete.
23:12:49 <lament> but sure
23:13:17 <lament> anyway, yeah.
23:13:53 <lament> ("turing-complete state machine" is rich, but let's not talk about that :) )
23:14:11 <lament> analog computers are computers too
23:14:23 <Korollary> right
23:14:35 <lament> anyway blah. it's all a matter of perspective
23:14:37 <Korollary> I meant that the digital circuit can be a turing machine
23:14:53 <lament> i can make a turing machine out of a bunch of rotten apples
23:15:09 <lament> however, are you implying that turing-completeness is necessary for something to qualify as a programming language?
23:15:13 <Korollary> no
23:15:16 <lament> okay
23:15:31 <lament> well, there we go :)
23:15:50 <Korollary> heh I thought we were interested in that particular subset tho
23:16:04 <lament> well, i still disagree
23:16:12 <lament> that analog circuits are not TC
23:16:19 <lament> after all, every circuit is an analog circuit
23:16:20 <Korollary> the circuits are
23:16:28 <Korollary> not their current description
23:16:33 <lament> why not?
23:17:24 <Korollary> because the description just states how the components are connected. It doesnt declare their physical properties (i.e. differential eqn's) that make the thing work
23:18:08 <lament> when i write a program, i don't declare how the primitives work.
23:18:11 <lament> that's why they're primitives
23:18:39 <lament> capacitors, transistors and such are all "primitives" and behave in a specified way
23:18:50 <lament> this is implicit in the diagrams
23:19:13 <Korollary> acutally I am wrong
23:19:18 <Korollary> it is specified
23:19:26 <Korollary> you can simulate an analog circuit in spice
23:19:36 <lament> of course it's specified
23:19:48 <lament> otherwise the diagrams would just be useless
23:19:50 <pejo> Since you guys are talking hardware - has anyone looked at Lava or other HDL's based on functional languages?
23:20:28 <lament> pejo: can't you tell neither of us knows what we're talking about? :)
23:20:37 <Korollary> pejo: heh sorry
23:21:04 <lament> anyway
23:21:08 <pejo> lament, heh.  Good point. ;)
23:21:15 <lament> if you consider (digital) circuit diagrams as a programming languages
23:21:28 <lament> it's a rather horrible language in comparison to the other ones.
23:21:35 <lament> Just like all other visual languages :)
23:21:37 <Korollary> lament: There's a difference in intended usage, tho
23:21:59 <lament> yeah
23:22:10 <Korollary> When hw guys look at circuits, they either look at them as pure schematic point of view, or from a layout perspective.
23:22:12 <lament> sometimes there're factors that justify horridness :)
23:22:53 <lament> on the ease-of-use scale circuits rank somewhere near assembly
23:23:03 <Korollary> below assembly imho
23:23:14 <lament> and visual lang. people want a language that would rank near haskell
23:23:23 <lament> (or whatever)
23:23:44 <Korollary> near English, maybe
23:23:54 <Korollary> "UML to executable"
23:23:57 <lament> if they get near C i'll be impressed.
23:24:01 <palomer> go pi calculus!
23:25:01 <palomer> man, I wish there was a simpler alternative to lambda mu calculus!
23:25:16 <Korollary> alternative for which purpose ?
23:25:29 <palomer> encoding classical proofs
23:25:36 <palomer> I really don't get lambda mu
23:26:09 <palomer> I don't understand what the type Gamma |- A_1 | A_2 | ... | A_n means
23:26:30 <Korollary> are you studying these on your own ?
23:26:35 <palomer> yes
23:26:49 <Korollary> ah
23:27:15 <palomer> actually, it was presented in one of my classes
23:27:31 <palomer> but, like, he didn't explain what the type meant
23:27:35 <palomer> he just gave the reduction rules
23:27:53 <Korollary> does he have office hours ?
23:28:22 <palomer> he's in paris
23:28:38 <palomer> and I doubt he could explain it in an intuitive manner
23:28:46 <Korollary> ugh
23:29:15 <Korollary> maybe there are other profs knowledgeable in the subject ?
23:29:30 <palomer> not in montreal
23:29:55 <Korollary> isnt mcgill in montreal ?
23:30:07 <palomer> yes
23:30:11 <palomer> I go to mcgill
23:30:13 <Korollary> oh
23:30:27 <palomer> actually...
23:30:31 <Korollary> man, I'd have thought there would be heaps of people at mcgill
23:31:12 <palomer> to explain the type Gamma |- A_1 | ... | A_n intuitively?
23:31:33 <palomer> if someone had found an intuitive explanation, we'd be using an easier calculus than lambda-mu
23:32:07 <Korollary> I am not following you
23:32:52 <palomer> lambda-mu isn't like anything we program with
23:33:19 <Korollary> ok, but I thought the guy who went to Paris understood what you wanted him to explain.
23:33:28 <pejo> palomer, would you say pi-calculus is anything like what we program with?
23:33:32 <palomer> I went to paris, not him
23:33:39 <Korollary> oh
23:33:45 <palomer> pejo: but I have an intuition about pi-calculus
23:34:06 <palomer> and I can see how it could model certain programming behaviour
23:34:18 <palomer> in fact, I'm sure there are programming languages based on pi-calculus
23:34:54 <palomer> pi-calculus rocks.
23:35:23 <pejo> palomer, sure, Sewell's tutorial goes through quite a lot about how to get the behaviour one wants in a language.
23:36:21 <palomer> sewell?
23:36:48 <palomer> and,erm, lambda calculus is embedded in lambda-mu, so I can get the behaviour I want out of it
23:37:45 <palomer> and I could probably embed all of lambda-mu back into lambda
23:37:57 <palomer> (lambda being turing complete)
23:38:14 <palomer> got a link to sewell's tutorial?
23:38:20 <pejo> palomer, Peter Sewell, it's downloadable on his homepage. But I guess that wasn't what you were looking for.
23:40:25 <palomer> the pi calculus tutorials?
23:40:47 <pejo> (Milners book might be a better option if you don't already know pi calculus, the 'tutorial' seems pretty focused at proofs).
23:40:53 <pejo> palomer, yeah?
23:40:59 <palomer> I have no problems with the pi calculus!
23:41:06 <palomer> it's lambda-mu that bothers the bejeezus out of me
