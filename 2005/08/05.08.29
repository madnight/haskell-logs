00:05:59 <Itkovian> hi boegel
00:06:13 <Itkovian> had a fertile weekend?
00:06:17 <Itkovian> idea-wise?
00:16:32 <FrederikEaton> nasty
00:19:00 <boegel> idea-wise ? gf-wise: yes :)
00:21:05 * Oejet will seehis gf tomorrow.  Yay!
00:22:13 <boegel> Oejet: how long has it been ?
00:22:58 <Oejet> boegel: Three weeks.
00:23:30 <boegel> Oejet: omg, I'd go nuts
00:23:50 <boegel> it's been over 2 years since we've missed each other more than 24 hours
00:24:27 <Oejet> boegel: And before that six months. :-s
00:25:35 <boegel> Oejet: is she from abroad or something ? and how do you keep in touch ?
00:25:49 <Oejet> boegel: 24 hours?  That scary. :-P
00:25:55 <Oejet> *That's
00:26:13 <boegel> Oejet: why ? :)
00:26:45 <boegel> many people tell me I'm nuts to see her so often, but hey, I like her :)
00:27:12 <boegel> and she only lives like 500m away from me, would be pretty stupid to not see her often :)
00:28:39 <Oejet> boegel: That's lucky.
00:34:20 <Oejet> boegel: She lives in Lithuania, but she studied a semester in Milano.  We keep in touch by letters, short messages, telephone and email.  Then of course meeting as often as possible, like you do. :-)
00:56:37 <boegel> Oejet: once you get used to seeing your gf as often as you do, it's hard to miss her
00:57:08 <boegel> that might pose a problem in the near future, when I have to go abroad for a while
00:58:49 <boegel> chucky: how's your kid doing?
00:58:51 <Oejet> boegel: For a while?
00:59:51 <Itkovian> lol: http://www.spreadinternetexplorer.com/
01:01:15 <boegel> Oejet: well yeah, a week orso :) that's long, when you're used to 'counting hours' :)
01:02:49 <dblhelix> the dutch railroad system is a logistic nightmare! ... :(
01:03:07 <boegel> Itkovian: "and you get a popunder where you type in the wourd you want to sarch for" *hehe
01:03:14 <boegel> dblhelix: it is ? how come ?
01:03:37 <Itkovian> dblhelix: you've never tried the belgian railways then
01:03:40 <aleator> Is it normal behaviour of ghci6.4 to need qualified names for everything? (Or have I screwed up somewhere..)
01:04:01 <boegel> "With Internet Explorer, I have to thoroughly search for highlighted word, which gives me a chance to read entire text, or at least throw a more than a cursory glance." mwoeha :)
01:04:10 <dblhelix> boegel: the railroad company used to be owned by the state, but it isn't anymore... hence, disaster
01:04:11 <boegel> Itkovian: oh come, they're not that bad
01:04:49 <dblhelix> I just spent three hours in the train... for a sixty km trip
01:05:00 <Itkovian> 'back and forth'
01:05:58 <boegel> dblhelix: that is pretty sucky :) maybe you're not using the system as  you should be :p
01:06:42 <dblhelix> boegel: you're right on that... the system is well known to be unreliable on Monday mornings and, yes, I was using it on a Monday morning...
01:07:08 <boegel> http://www.spreadinternetexplorer.com/files/images/jihad4_0.jpg hehehe, gotta love it
01:07:12 <dblhelix> boegel: problem is that it's not that reliable on Tuesdays either ... and for Wednesdays...
01:07:25 <boegel> dblhelix: heh, sounds nice :)
01:07:50 <dblhelix> boegel: yes, I'm really in a party mood right now....
01:07:59 * dblhelix needs some coffee... badly
01:08:03 * boegel parties with dblhelix 
01:12:38 <boegel> Itkovian: getie is a cool website :)
01:17:14 * boegel decides to switch back to IE (and hence, also to windows, off course)
02:02:30 <Itkovian> dcoutts: ping
02:08:34 <dcoutts> Itkovian, pong
02:10:07 <KiMoS> hi, what is the command in hugs to see that type function are?
02:10:39 <KiMoS> and there was a command that shows step by step how haskell calculate  ?
02:10:50 <tromp> :t
02:11:43 <KiMoS> thx and for the second quastion? :)
02:11:45 <dcoutts> KiMoS, hugs does not hava a command that shows step by step how haskell calculates
02:12:25 <KiMoS> (square.succ) 5
02:12:25 <KiMoS> => square (succ 5)
02:12:25 <KiMoS> => (succ 5) * (succ 5)
02:12:25 <KiMoS> => 6 * 6
02:12:25 <KiMoS> => 36
02:12:32 <KiMoS> like that
02:12:36 <dcoutts> KiMoS, there might be other tools that could help with this, like debuggers
02:12:56 <KiMoS> i am sure about it   i only forgot the command
02:13:12 <dcoutts> but generally it's not done, the reduction steps are usually measured in the 1000's so it wouldn't help you much
02:13:32 <dcoutts> I've never seen such a command in hugs
02:13:41 <KiMoS> hm ok
02:13:59 <KiMoS> im going underinvestagation then  i will show it to u :)
02:14:00 <xerox> 'morning!
02:14:11 <KiMoS> morning
02:14:14 <dcoutts> KiMoS, use :?  to list the commands in hugs
02:14:52 <dcoutts> morning xerox
02:14:53 <tromp> or in ghci
02:17:19 <boegel> hiya xerox, any progress on the Cairo binding ?
02:17:30 <xerox> boegel: docs!
02:17:48 * boegel is again amazed how fast time flies when he's working
02:19:54 <KiMoS> does prolog had such a command?
02:20:22 <dons> morning xerox!
02:20:42 * dons cooks dinner
02:20:43 <xerox> morning!
02:20:49 <KiMoS> i think i was wronge it was prolog who had such a command dcoutts
02:20:51 <xerox> Emacs crashed *grml*
02:21:11 <psi> Kimos: I don't know about prolog, but I do know that some lisps have it
02:21:16 <Itkovian> dcoutts: is the parser ok?
02:23:25 <dcoutts> Itkovian, I must admit I've not integrated it yet, but it looks fine to me thus far
02:23:27 * xerox screams
02:24:01 <Itkovian> ok
02:27:12 <ndm> KiMoS, Hugs definately doesn't have a command, but Hat does
02:27:21 <ndm> @google haskell hat
02:27:56 <KiMoS> i will search for it ndm thanks alot
02:28:05 <ndm> http://haskell.org/hat
02:28:18 <ndm> i knew the URL, i was just trying to be lazy with typing - unsuccessfully
02:28:26 <KiMoS> :)
02:29:55 <KiMoS> oh its linux
02:29:58 <KiMoS> im under windows
02:33:47 <ndm> KiMoS, yeah - for the moment - i know efforts are underway to port it to windows
02:33:57 <ndm> mainly because i'm the one porting it
02:34:23 <KiMoS> its not an easy job
02:35:41 <ndm> actually its not that hard, once some other projects are completed
02:35:54 <ndm> but yeah, not for another few months yet
02:36:10 <KiMoS> goodluck with it
02:37:27 <ndm> thanks, there will be a post on the haskell mailing list once its done
02:44:03 <Beelsebob> ndm: what is there breaking in hat on windows?
02:44:17 <ndm> a few things
02:44:22 <Beelsebob> ... or are you doing a full blown port rather than a cygwin one?
02:44:24 <ndm> its a pain to get a hat-trace made up
02:44:30 <ndm> ah, cygwin isn't a port
02:44:35 <ndm> its a poorly executed joke
02:44:36 <Beelsebob> fair enough
02:44:55 <ndm> i never got the tools set up under windows
02:44:57 <cjb> It's true.  :/
02:45:22 <ndm> Beelsebob, how do the viewing tools work - totally cross platform i guess
02:45:33 <ndm> but there is an underlying C library?
02:45:40 <ndm> has that been win'ified
02:45:58 <Beelsebob> there's a Haskell library
02:46:05 <Beelsebob> that I think uses readline under it
02:46:15 <Beelsebob> look in CommonUI.hs
02:46:39 <Beelsebob> not *very* common, but at least a few things in there
02:46:40 <ndm> does it not use the haskell readline library?
02:46:54 <ndm> (since malcolm wrote it and all)
02:46:59 <Beelsebob> um... pass... I've not looked at what's below commonUI
02:47:12 <Beelsebob> quite possibly
02:47:25 <ndm> i know there is a C library beneath that actually reads the traces
02:47:42 <Beelsebob> yeh, that shouldn't need any changes I don't think
02:47:51 <Beelsebob> it's all standard c
02:48:13 <ndm> so its probably just that everyone is too lazy to do a port?
02:48:31 <Beelsebob> no, it's probably that no one in the hat team uses windows
02:48:54 <Beelsebob> (other than you)
02:49:31 <ndm> i'm not really in the hat team, more just sitting near them
02:49:40 <Beelsebob> heh
02:49:56 <Beelsebob> you came to hat day, that qualifies I think
02:50:19 <ndm> yeah, must finish my hat day report
02:50:29 <Beelsebob> heh... that could be a plan, couldn't it
02:50:52 <Beelsebob> t'would involve me getting up though :/
02:51:28 <Beelsebob> if you end up having to fiddle the UI code, could you try and make it a little more abstract
02:51:44 <Beelsebob> (or a lot as the case may be)
02:52:07 <ndm> my port relies on other peoples work
02:52:26 <ndm> Tom's hat generation, otherwise its a nightmare to test hat tools for me
02:52:29 <Beelsebob> heh :/
02:52:33 <ndm> and then your GUI abstraction
02:52:39 <ndm> then my windows port comes in...
02:53:15 <Beelsebob> cool
02:53:31 <Beelsebob> so it relies on me doing some work... hmm, could be a flawed plan here
02:53:32 <Beelsebob> *g*
02:53:50 <ndm> well i have plenty of other projects to be getting on with
02:54:55 <Beelsebob> hehe, tell me about it
02:55:31 <Beelsebob> oh bugger... I can hear the fire alarm getting confused... time for me to have a shower and get out of here
03:01:57 <Pita> Is it as simple as to use "do" to use monads?
03:05:25 <bringert> I think I just made HaskellDB support GHC 6.4 and Cabal
03:05:37 <bringert> sorry for being so slow about it
03:06:33 <ndm> Pita, most of the time, yes, roughly
03:06:34 <vegai> Pita: if you don't think about it and are lucky, then yeah
03:06:47 <Pita> how can I be unlucky and screw up?
03:06:59 <Pita> To me it's like the (progn () ()) statement in Lisp
03:07:01 <Pita> is that so?
03:07:04 <vegai> you might try to do something inside the monad that you're not supposed to
03:10:27 <Beelsebob> pita: the first thing you should do is check whether you need a monad or just think you do
03:11:03 <Beelsebob> because 90% of programs need only two monadic functions, and that's some sort of interaction loop, and main
03:12:38 <Lor> Is this with or without unsafeInterleaveIO?
03:12:46 <Beelsebob> without
03:15:13 <aleator> Pita: do {x <- [1,2,3]; y<-[5,6,7]; return (x*y)} would, for example, be using do and still be rather different from what you'd expect from progn..
03:36:05 <reppie[^_^]> http://sleepingsquirrel.org/monads/monads.html
03:56:54 <ChronoWiz> man my haskell lecturer is a chump..
03:57:15 <ChronoWiz> can anyone tell me what is wrong with this show function? it's in the notes and it's supposed to work..
03:57:22 <ChronoWiz> data Shape = Line Float Float
03:57:33 <ChronoWiz> instance Show Shape where
03:57:35 <ChronoWiz>    show Line l a = "Line " ++ (show l) ++ " " ++ (show a)
03:57:41 <ndm> brackets
03:57:47 <ndm> show (Line l a )
03:57:56 <vegai> yep.
03:58:01 <ndm> show (Line l a) = "Line " ++ show l ++ " " ++ show a
03:58:07 <ChronoWiz> ahhh
03:58:09 <ChronoWiz> cheers
03:58:15 <ndm> and excessive brackets on the other side as well, but that won't stop it working
03:58:28 <ndm> but it does indicate your lecturer may not understand the precedence rules...
03:58:45 <ChronoWiz> so much of what's in the notes is wrong... eesh
03:58:59 <ndm> you would have thought they could have at least tested it...
03:59:02 <vegai> better report it, then
03:59:20 <vegai> ndm: well, it's so trivial that it must be right :P
04:03:19 <ChronoWiz> can you define a show function for something that you have typecast with type etc = or does it have to be with data?
04:03:59 <ndm> only data and newtype
04:04:02 <ndm> not type
04:11:58 <ChronoWiz> is hugs GPLed?
04:12:50 <ndm> BSD'd i think
04:12:56 <ndm> most haskell stuff is BSD

04:14:18 * vegai wears his legalese-glasses.
04:14:32 <ndm> I'm pretty sure that is BSD without advertising condition
04:14:52 <vegai> still too bright :/
04:15:26 <ndm> thats why i like the creative commons licenses, pretty pictures and icons for what the rules are
04:15:54 <ChronoWiz> hmm
04:16:09 <ndm> what do you want to do to Hugs?
04:16:38 <ChronoWiz> just wondering what license, if it was free software
04:16:59 <ndm> it is free software, and teh license is very liberal - do anything pretty much
04:17:03 <ChronoWiz> seeing as it has mostly academic and research use, it should be
04:17:12 <ChronoWiz> well it's not Free Software if it's BSD but it's close
04:17:38 <ndm> it is free software if its bsd without advertising
04:18:03 <ndm> one of teh rights you have to Hugs is to copy it, rename it to GnuHugs, and release it under the GPL
04:18:40 <ChronoWiz> hmmm good idea lol
04:18:52 <ChronoWiz> i see what you mean, anyway enough legalese
04:19:04 <boegel> cmeme: wtf ???
04:19:08 <ChronoWiz> is there any way to make hugs always display [[Int]] with a particular show function?
04:19:14 <ChronoWiz> ie always have it display like a matrix?
04:19:40 <ndm> no, but you can declare data Matrix a = Matrix [[a]] and write a show for that
04:19:46 <dcoutts> ChronoWiz, no, you'll need to write your own function to display it in an alternative format
04:21:06 <ChronoWiz> so how do i declare a variable as a Matrix?
04:21:15 <boegel> someone should temp-ban/kick cmeme, this is really annoying
04:21:27 <ChronoWiz> foo :: Matrix doesn't work
04:21:55 <ChronoWiz> sorry if my questions are dumb but i have bad lecture handouts :)
04:23:42 <boegel> b0gg1e: you almost stole my nick :p
04:23:56 <ndm> how do you mean?
04:24:04 <boegel> ChronoWiz: how do you mean, 'it doesn't work'
04:24:07 <b0gg1e> how can this be, as I was first ;-)
04:24:08 <ndm> using the data declaration i gave above?
04:24:24 <ndm> you have to do foo :: Matrix Int
04:24:30 <boegel> b0gg1e: you were here first, that might be true, but I've had this nick for ages
04:24:43 <b0gg1e> :-)
04:24:49 <boegel> ;)
04:25:01 <boegel> omfg, someone pls ban cmeme (temporary that is)
04:25:09 <b0gg1e> i once was contaced by a guy from australia who was looking for a friend that also has the nick "boggle" (i am german).
04:25:13 <b0gg1e> we had a funny talk.
04:25:22 <ChronoWiz> i didn't use quite your data declaration
04:25:38 <ndm> what was your data decl?
04:25:59 <ChronoWiz> data Object = Matrix [[Int]]
04:26:21 <ndm> foo :: Object
04:26:30 <ndm> foo = Matrix [[1]]
04:26:54 <vegai> I almost wish they had made constructors stand out from types
04:26:59 <ChronoWiz> ahhh
04:27:08 <ChronoWiz> thanks ndm
04:27:14 <vegai> perhaps make them all-caps or something like that
04:27:21 <vegai> or elite-caps :P
04:27:27 <vegai> data Object = MaTrIx [[Int]]
04:27:53 <ndm> vegai, its hard enough teaching beginners about the caps rule as it is!
04:27:57 <ChronoWiz> so Matrix is the constructor and Object is the type?
04:28:04 <vegai> ChronoWiz: yep
04:28:14 <ChronoWiz> so what if i say type Blah = ...
04:28:15 <vegai> ndm: I think them looking alike is more confusing
04:28:18 <ChronoWiz> what is Blah?
04:28:23 <ChronoWiz> is that a type?
04:28:26 <boegel> b0gg1e: where you able to help him ? :)
04:28:30 <vegai> ChronoWiz: since they're different, you could do data Matrix = Matrix [[Int]] you know
04:28:43 <vegai> Blah is a type synonym in that case
04:28:49 <ChronoWiz> type synonym
04:28:50 <ChronoWiz> ok
04:28:52 * boegel hits cmeme with a big sledge hammer
04:28:54 <vegai> which works like a type
04:29:24 <ndm> if you have come from C say, imagine type X = Y as #define X Y
04:29:35 <ChronoWiz> yeah i'm from C..
04:29:36 <ndm> just replace all occurances of X with Y in your head
04:29:36 <vegai> I guess if perl didn't have a bad reputation, we could have data Matrix = $Matrix [[Int]] ...
04:29:38 <ChronoWiz> ah so type is like a macro
04:29:40 <b0gg1e> hmm as i wasnt that other boggle i couldnt answer his question, but i think i was a nice substitute as a partner for a little smalltalk :-)
04:29:47 <ChronoWiz> nah perl is cool :)
04:29:48 <vegai> would data Matrix = MATRIX [Int] be that ugly?
04:30:00 <ndm> yes
04:30:16 <ChronoWiz> haskell is hard to get my head around coming from C and perl...
04:30:17 <ndm> well, no - but consider SOMEMULTIPLEWORDPHRASE
04:30:25 <vegai> yeah, that's not good
04:30:31 <vegai> {MATRIX}
04:30:40 <ChronoWiz> nah that's worse
04:30:42 <vegai> I mean [Matrix}
04:30:48 <vegai> heh, that was an accident
04:31:25 <vegai> Matrix!
04:31:46 <vegai> I guess this is all futile since no-one's gonna change the language like that...
04:31:48 <ndm> but {} is already taken
04:32:01 <ChronoWiz> ok next problem
04:32:17 <ChronoWiz> argh

04:37:46 * boegel notices cmeme is gone and does a little dance (supported by Flogging Molly)
04:38:12 <boegel> welcome everyone !!1!1!!
04:41:25 <Itkovian> pompom
04:42:07 <dcoutts> boegel, ha, no such luck :-)
04:44:59 <ChronoWiz> hmmm this all done netsplitting?
04:45:18 <boegel> ChronoWiz: no, they were rebooting the servers apparently
04:45:28 <ChronoWiz> well cmeme is doing the same old same old..
04:46:43 <ChronoWiz> um i had a question i was going to ask right when they did the reboot..
04:48:15 * boegel grrs on cmeme
04:48:27 <boegel> nobody has op-status to stop this ?
04:48:45 <ChronoWiz> ok so i have my variable testM :: Object
04:48:56 <ChronoWiz> testM = Matrix [[1,2],[3,4]]
04:49:02 <ChronoWiz> and i have my show function working
04:49:13 <ChronoWiz> so i can type testM and it shows it the way i want it to
04:49:28 <xerox> Why do you feed a [[]] to Matrix?
04:49:31 <ChronoWiz> but now i can't use zipWith (zipWith (+)) testM testM to add it
04:49:54 <ChronoWiz> how should i do it, xerox?
04:51:00 <ChronoWiz> is that because my show function is messing up the formatting so zipwith doesn't treat it as a list?
04:55:06 <xerox> @type zipWith
04:55:40 <xerox> You have to define a zipMatrixWith I think.
04:55:53 <ChronoWiz> oh.. hmm
04:58:21 <ChronoWiz> wth
04:58:26 <ChronoWiz> hugs command line is now acting like vi
04:59:30 <ChronoWiz> is it supposed to do that?
05:01:32 <sieni_> ChronoWiz: Well, mine does, but then again I have "set editing-mode vi" and "set keymap vi" in my ~/.inputrc
05:06:43 <boegel> dons: we lost lambdabot
05:07:21 <cjb`> "Maybe it's in New Orleans."
05:07:31 <wilx> MIA
05:09:52 <dons> oh. fixing.
05:10:39 <dons> hi CosmicRay.
05:10:47 <dons> you pinged 3 or 4 days ago?
05:11:02 <CosmicRay> dons: probably regarding the fps patches I sent your way
05:11:21 <dons> they've all been applied and pushed into the main repo
05:11:28 <CosmicRay> dons: did they look OK, and will you be feeding them back to darcs as well?
05:11:34 <CosmicRay> I guess that answers the first question
05:12:04 <dons> well, i've tried to send some critical patches back to darcs, but we're moving forward too fast at the moment.
05:12:17 <CosmicRay> "we" meaning darcs or FPS?
05:12:22 <dons> FPS
05:12:39 <dons> I think maybe a stable FPS might be a better candidate to push back to darcs
05:12:55 <CosmicRay> I see, that makes sense.
05:13:03 <CosmicRay> I've just now read the FPS thread on darcs-devel
05:13:04 <dons> 2 patches, a bug fix and a big performance improvement on == have been committed back into darcs
05:13:20 <CosmicRay> were you going to have 2 different implementations of lines/unlines in your FPS?
05:13:29 <CosmicRay> just read about that 45 seconds ago ;-)
05:13:30 <dons> I think that's a good idea.
05:13:40 <dons> I don't fancy trying to change the Prelude
05:14:32 <dons> what do you think?
05:15:03 <CosmicRay> yeah, I can see david's point about usefulness to being able to reassamble a file exactly... and I also see the utility of being compatible with the prelude version, which is what I would want most times
05:15:09 <CosmicRay> so I think it makes sense to have the two different versions.
05:15:21 <dons> ok. that's my opinion as well.
05:28:54 <CosmicRay> hmm, meme.b9.com (URL for #haskell logs) is not accessible.
05:29:40 <dons> tunes.org is up, http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/
05:43:11 * boegel sees gimp crashing upon opening a PNG file and wonders what's going on
05:45:54 * boegel sees gimp crashing when opening every file and _really_ wonders what's up
05:46:09 <vegai> it si teh bork
05:46:37 <dons> vegai si teh bork
05:46:51 <vegai> you vill be assimilated!
05:55:02 <pesco> dons, CosmicRay: What's FPS?
05:55:15 <CosmicRay> pesco: FastPackedString
05:55:25 <CosmicRay> pesco: dons split it off from darcs and is maintaining it as a separate package
05:55:43 <pesco> Oh, I see.
06:10:00 <CosmicRay> pesco: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/fps.html
06:16:12 <Beelsebob> oh for fucks sake... how many net splits do we need??
06:21:13 <Beelsebob> if this net splits again, I won't be impressed
06:31:22 <Pita> What's a good library for fast binary IO with buffering and all the necessities
06:33:34 <CosmicRay> Pita: FastPackedString
06:41:56 * boegel returns from a system crash
06:42:49 <Beelsebob> :/
06:42:53 <Beelsebob> what system's that?
06:43:25 * Beelsebob sticks the kettle on
06:46:07 * Beelsebob wonders if his shoulders have got an inch wider over night or if all his shirts have got an inch smaller over night
06:48:29 <boegel> my workstation at work
06:48:43 <boegel> but we fixed ip (hopefully)
06:48:48 <boegel> lost my uptime though :(
06:48:51 <Beelsebob> hehe
06:49:53 <Beelsebob> mine's disappointing just now, I had to reboot to sort out sudo
06:50:03 <Beelsebob> tatd2@jet ~ $ uptime
06:50:03 <Beelsebob>  14:44:32 up 32 days, 23:14,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
06:50:54 <Pita> Beelsebob: hi
06:50:59 <Beelsebob> evening
06:51:04 <Pita> Beelsebob: What is the normal way of performing binary IO in haskell
06:51:11 <Pita> I cannot find the definitive stgandard
06:51:25 <Beelsebob> pita: don't know... didn't someone suggest something back there
06:51:28 <Beelsebob> hang on...
06:51:44 <Beelsebob> bugger... the net split scrolled it off the screen
06:52:02 <ndm> Pita, if you use nhc it has a whole binary package
06:52:03 <xerox> @google deepSeq
06:52:05 <lambdabot> http://urchin.earth.li/icfpcontest/2004/sub/tools/shared/DeepSeq.lhs
06:52:22 <Pita> how does ghc and hc differ?
06:52:32 <Pita> ghc and nhc
06:52:32 <Beelsebob> hc?
06:52:33 <ndm> ghc and nhc are both haskell compiler
06:52:42 <Pita> which is more popular?
06:52:44 <Beelsebob> ghc is slower, but generates faster code
06:52:45 <ndm> ghc is more commonly used, has lots of extensions
06:52:50 <Beelsebob> ghc has more extensions
06:53:02 <ndm> nhc has better memory useage and faster compiles
06:53:10 <Beelsebob> nhc complies to the standard and the addendums
06:53:29 <ndm> in general most things you download probably won't compile on nhc...
06:53:53 <Beelsebob> because everyone uses extensions
06:54:50 <Beelsebob> hmm, maybe I should suggest that to simon... the "get rid of all the extension based code" refactoring
06:54:51 <ndm> oh, and i think nhc is not windows compatible yet
06:55:05 <Beelsebob> that's okay neil. pita's a macie
06:55:15 <ndm> surely hte HaRe project should have that bundled
06:55:36 <Pita> ahh
06:55:43 <Beelsebob> nope... HaRe uses programatica's front end
06:55:44 <Pita> which one produces faster executiable?
06:55:53 <Beelsebob> ghc... but not by much
06:56:01 <Beelsebob> so it can't parse extension using code
06:56:19 <Beelsebob> I think they're porting it to the ghc6.5 front end atm
06:57:34 <ndm> ghc, by a long way
06:57:47 <ndm> much faster, about 10 times Tom reckons
06:57:51 <Beelsebob> really?
06:57:54 <ndm> yep
06:57:59 <Beelsebob> I thought nhc wasn't too bad these days
06:58:01 <Beelsebob> oh well
06:58:14 <ndm> nope, apparently it looses a lot with interpretive overhead
06:58:29 <ndm> and then it has quite a lot of optimisations removed - strictness, inlining, specialisation
06:58:46 <ndm> however, for most benchmarks it wins if you include compile time
06:58:57 <ndm> i think nqueens with n=9 it wins, with n=10 it looses
06:59:22 <Beelsebob> ah, okay
07:00:35 <Beelsebob> pita: if it compiles in nhc, it should compile in ghc though
07:00:50 <Beelsebob> so it's a good place to start while you're doing a lot of compilation
07:01:15 <Beelsebob> and hmake really helps as a build system
07:01:37 <ndm> (i think pita might get the wrong impression - there are probably about 5 people who would advocate nhc, and he's ended up talking to 2 of them)
07:01:52 <Pita> no way :)
07:01:52 <Beelsebob> true
07:02:30 <Beelsebob> actually... I know a few people won't use ghc because they think that the extensions have destroyed haskell
07:02:40 <ndm> who?
07:02:51 <ndm> and do they use hugs or nhc
07:02:58 <Beelsebob> hugs unfortunately
07:03:02 <ndm> i always get the feeling i'm one of the few remaining hugs people
07:03:10 <ndm> hey, don't knock hugs - it rules :)
07:03:28 <Beelsebob> I know Simon Thompson doesn't like ghc... despite deciding that he has to use it for the front end of HaRe
07:03:32 <Beelsebob> chris ryder won't use it
07:03:37 <Beelsebob> Olaf doesn't like it
07:03:41 <ndm> and my build is from before the time when it support heirarchical libs
07:04:04 <Beelsebob> I'm not knocking hugs... I just wish more people would use nhc
07:04:28 <Beelsebob> oh bugger... ports has installed and decided it needs to use ftp for everything
07:04:36 <Beelsebob> ... which is annoying seeing as it's blocked
07:05:02 <ndm> i will use nhc when:
07:05:30 <ndm> it has a windows gui front end, does not require gcc, outputs cross platform code, runs on windows
07:05:49 <Beelsebob> why do you want a gui for a compiler?
07:05:54 <Beelsebob> or do you mean nhci?
07:05:56 <ndm> i like winhugs
07:06:11 <ndm> compiler/interpretter are pretty much the same thing nowadays
07:06:27 <Beelsebob> they are in terms of nhc, but not in terms of what the user sees
07:06:29 <ndm> difference between having a binary you can keep and not - and usually i don't want a binary
07:06:54 <ndm> i would still want a gui
07:07:02 <ndm> to test expressions etc without a compile
07:07:12 <ndm> (or without a save, and an explicit compile)
07:08:38 <Pita> is there a good example for binary io?
07:09:28 <ndm> http://www.haskell.org/nhc98/libs/Binary.html
07:09:35 <ndm> not sure binary package will work on ghc
07:09:37 <ndm> but it might
07:10:48 <boegel> okay lilo, send my greetings to stich
07:10:50 <boegel> ^_^
07:12:06 * Beelsebob is confused
07:15:10 <Beelsebob> hehehehehehehehehe! friend of mine just saw emerge scrolling up the screen and went "WHOA! You mean matrix code means something????"
07:15:12 <ndm> global message from lilo, watch lilo and stitch
07:15:37 <Beelsebob> heh
07:19:44 * boegel apologizes for his childish behaviour once again
07:20:04 * Beelsebob spanks boegel
07:20:19 <Beelsebob> not that way Philippa!
07:23:12 * boegel rubs his ass
07:28:03 <boegel> a clone ?
07:32:50 <Beelsebob> http://www.energydrinkreviews.com/images/Stewie.jpg
07:41:03 <Itkovian> pfft
07:41:33 <Beelsebob> offs not again
07:45:57 <boegel> Beelsebob: cool :) gotta love Stewie :)
07:50:05 <dcoutts> Beelsebob, I wonder if the new nhc will be able to support Gtk2Hs, Axel and I want to persuade Simon Thompson to use Gtk2Hs when teaching multimedia/gui stuff with Haskell. :-)
07:50:42 <Beelsebob> dcoutts: why doesn't the current nhc support it?
07:50:59 <dcoutts> Beelsebob, some minor language things, and FFI things
07:51:14 <Beelsebob> hmm, Don't know... Tom isn't online to poke
07:51:31 <Beelsebob> I shall poke him when I see him
07:51:54 <dcoutts> Beelsebob, we've not investigated it in too much detail so I'm not exactly sure what is missing.
07:52:20 <Beelsebob> m'kay
07:52:26 <dcoutts> it'd be nice to avoid too much #ifdef GHC / #elseif NHC ...
07:52:41 <Beelsebob> I know that 99% of the work is going into the backend, so I wouldn't expect that it will... but I'll ask tom
07:52:54 <dcoutts> we've tried to remain pretty standard with language features
07:53:02 <CosmicRay> hmm.  does hugs not support forkProcess?
07:53:20 <Beelsebob> that makes it likely that it won't be much that stops it working
07:53:40 <dcoutts> Beelsebob, the only thing we really need is full FFI support
07:54:00 <Beelsebob> dcoutts: What's missing from nhc's ffi?
07:54:49 <dcoutts> I note from the web site:
07:54:51 <dcoutts> foreign import "wrapper" is not yet supported.
07:55:00 <Beelsebob> ah, okay
07:55:06 <dcoutts> that's pretty crucial to support callbacks
07:55:12 <Beelsebob> :/
07:55:14 <Beelsebob> how annoying
07:55:31 <dcoutts> or we need to be able to call Haskell code from a C api
07:55:38 <dcoutts> hugs and ghc support that too
07:56:19 <Beelsebob> yep
07:57:19 <Beelsebob> dcoutts: the greencard page mentions a lot of calling haskell from C
07:57:35 <Beelsebob> there must be a way of doing it
07:57:40 <dcoutts> and that supports nhc?
07:57:46 <Beelsebob> http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/nhc98/greencard-york.html
07:58:27 <dcoutts> hmm
07:59:02 <xerox> dcoutts: argh, what happened to gobby?
07:59:09 <xerox> I was writing in there
07:59:58 <dcoutts> xerox, dunno, It's still here
08:01:36 <Beelsebob> I think I'm gonna go uike down the beach
08:01:39 <Beelsebob> see you all later
08:05:26 * boegel lost track of time
08:05:40 <boegel> I had _no_ idea it's 5pm already
08:08:25 * boegel leaves for home
08:16:27 <mikehammad> if i read a value from an unboxed array, do some arithmetic on it, and write it back to the array, does the value become boxed somewhere in the process?
08:17:27 <goron> Can't someone write HBrowser, the one browsers that actually works(TM)!
08:17:36 <goron> er browser
08:38:00 <lispy`> goron: what do you use now for a browser?
08:38:59 <lispy`> also, think web browsers would a lot better if people would realize they are document browers and implement the rest of the *crap* in a separate "web application platform" app
08:39:27 <lispy`> at least, it would have the potential to greatly reduce complexity
08:40:41 <dcoutts> mikehammad, it really does depend on exactly what you do with the value and how the compiler is able to optimise your code
08:45:50 <goron> lispy`: Konqueror/Firefox/Opera.
08:46:23 <goron> lispy`: We had this discussion before, and we agreed. Remember?
08:54:18 <lispy`> goron: ah, i have a terrible memory, but i do remember bit of a discussion
08:59:37 <conal>  /msg nickserv register TinkerBell
09:00:49 <conal> cr*p
09:01:29 <Philippa> you use that password anywhere else? (don't answer that)
09:01:58 <conal> i'm still figuring out irc stuff, and clearly that was an oops.
09:02:33 <conal> how should i have set a password w/o it showing up like that.  i'll certainly use a different password.
09:02:46 <gnu_vegan> Don't put space in front of commands
09:03:06 <Philippa> yup. In preference, /query somewhere you don't mind seeing it if you screw up
09:04:24 <ski_> (such as yourself)
09:04:55 <conal> private messaging myself?
09:04:57 <Philippa> yep. Or if your client supports it sensibly, straight at the server
09:05:01 <ski_> sure :)
09:05:03 <Philippa> conal: what client're you using?
09:05:08 <lispy`> conal: fwiw, you haven't really irc'd until you've made at least one mistake like that :)
09:05:16 <conal> thanks.
09:05:19 <conal> i'm using gaim
09:05:22 <Philippa> no, you tell it to direct anything that doesn't look like a command to yourself
09:05:33 <Philippa> that way, if you goof and it's not a /msg command, it'll go to you
09:06:14 <Philippa> ('course, if you send it to the wrong nick you're in trouble - wanna bet there're people camping mickserv et al?)
09:06:57 <lispy`> Philippa: did you play with the q3 source at all?
09:09:57 <Philippa> not yet
09:10:04 <lispy`> do you use darcs?
09:10:09 <Philippa> tbh I've had other things on my mind recently
09:10:13 <Philippa> yeah, I'm using it with Flippi
09:10:17 <lispy`> @where lispyquake
09:10:18 <lambdabot> I know nothing about lispyquake.
09:10:21 <lispy`> @where lispyquake3
09:10:22 <lambdabot> I know nothing about lispyquake3.
09:10:22 <Philippa> although I'm probably not making the best possible use
09:10:32 <lispy`> http://www.codersbase.com/quake3
09:10:42 <lispy`> i thought i told lambdabot about it :)
09:10:45 <lispy`> but maybe not
09:11:08 <lispy`> yeah, i've been having a hard time understanding how to compile the code for mods
09:11:17 <lispy`> which seems like a prerequisite to understanding the system
09:12:28 <Philippa> I did a small amount of modding ages back, though I've kinda forgotten. Need to dig up my Q3A CD and install the content again
09:15:22 <lispy`> yeah, i've discovered that you can either compile part to bytecode or a dll, but actually doing the compilation and then using the result is where i'm stuck
09:15:37 <lispy`> i can compile a binary, but i don't think the .qvm stuff is being compiled
09:15:46 <Philippa> go read a Q3A modding tutorial
09:15:47 <Philippa> there're many
09:15:49 <lispy`> i'm on OSX which is unfamiliar and that doesn't help
09:16:01 <lispy`> yeah, i found some, but they are win32 centrric
09:16:24 <lispy`> that's how i fonud out about the .qvm stuff and the dlls
09:16:38 <lispy`> anyway...
09:16:48 <lispy`> just thought i'd ask :)
09:21:52 <Lemmih> Hi SyntaxNinja.
09:22:09 <lispy`> Philippa: oh, another problem with osx is that it's not clear if you can use command line arguments when starting q3
09:22:12 <SyntaxNinja> hi
09:22:20 <lispy`> SyntaxNinja: hi
09:23:17 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^:
09:23:30 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: did you see droundy's post to haskell-cafe? he's working on some fuse bindings.
09:23:37 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: that's what happens when you keep stuff secret :P
09:24:16 <SyntaxNinja> lispy`: hi
09:27:15 <Lunar^> yaarg_: hey!
09:27:18 <Lunar^> oops
09:27:36 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja: hey! I never said that I would like this binding to stay secret!
09:29:05 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: but you didn't want anyone to know about it until it was "done" :)
09:29:11 <yaarg_> Lunar^: hehe odd tab completion error there! :P
09:29:32 <SyntaxNinja> so I didn't really tell ppl, and there was never an announcement
09:29:48 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja :(
09:30:19 <Lunar^> I was waiting for GHC 6.4.1, because of Cabal 1.1 and the fix about FFI
09:30:25 <Lunar^> now I remember
09:30:43 <Lunar^> I don't know what to do
09:30:57 <Lunar^> maybe we should write to him?
09:31:08 <Lunar^> My original motivation for this binding was to make a DarcsFS !
09:31:38 <SyntaxNinja> I posted about it to -cafe and to him, so maybe we can start working together.
09:33:09 <Lunar^> cool
09:33:28 <Lunar^> I'm still deep inside big sysadmin work currently
09:34:25 <SyntaxNinja> I really want to make a generic "vfs" interface for Haskell
09:35:34 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, so we can make lazy file systems with infinite decending trees of directories? :-)
09:35:46 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yes!
09:35:53 <dcoutts> muwahhahaha
09:35:59 <xerox> Yay
09:36:03 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: or more so that people can use my filesystem in their haskell programs and not rely on the System.IO interface
09:36:14 <dcoutts> oh, ok :-)
09:36:22 <SyntaxNinja> or use the darcs FS or whatever
09:36:31 <Lunar^> so cool
09:36:46 <xerox> Will it implement a strict (binary?) way to do I/O operations?
09:36:58 <dcoutts> I thought you means for exposing haskell programs as file systems to the rest of the system
09:37:21 <xerox> Sounds lispy, heh
09:37:29 <SyntaxNinja> it would be nice if you could swap out packages; like if you want to use the System.IO module, then yoyu use -package posix, if you want to use the Halfs moudle, then you use -pckage Halfs, and you don't have to change any code.
09:37:30 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, like plan9
09:37:43 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: "the rest of hte system" meaning unix or whatever? that's what fuse does, right?
09:37:49 <dcoutts> yes
09:38:17 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts:  yeah, we have that now with hfuse
09:38:34 <dcoutts> cool, how easy is it to implement a simple FS?
09:38:43 <SyntaxNinja> all you have to do is override some functions.
09:38:49 <dcoutts> or I guess that's what your Workshop presentation is about?
09:38:53 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: yeah
09:39:01 <SyntaxNinja> well, it's not about how easy it is ;)
09:39:17 <dcoutts> sadly, I'll not be there. hope to read the paper though. :-)
09:39:20 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: yeah, I do strict binary IO
09:39:26 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: there's no paper.
09:39:36 <xerox> Tape it :-D
09:39:37 <dcoutts> slides?
09:39:41 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: sure
09:39:47 <dcoutts> ok
09:40:01 <SyntaxNinja> you shoulda ll send me email and tell me you want to play with my haskell filesystem, so I can show them to my boss :)
09:40:08 <SyntaxNinja> that'll get it released faster
09:40:40 <dcoutts> SyntaxNinja, I don't have any serious application in mind however :-(
09:40:56 <dcoutts> i'm not sure I'd be a very persuasive case :-)
09:41:02 <SyntaxNinja> did I say "serious applicants only"?
09:41:06 <dcoutts> heh
09:51:52 <SyntaxNinja> @seen shapr
09:51:53 <lambdabot> I saw shapr leaving #haskell 19 hours, 1 minute and 4 seconds ago,
09:51:53 <lambdabot> and I have missed 2 minutes and 16 seconds since then.
10:09:11 <astrolabe> I am amazed by google earth.  It might be my favorite app ever.
10:22:30 <rt> so, if I have a parser to write in haskell, would parsec or happy be the more appropriate choice?
10:23:11 <Lemmih> Could you be a bit more specific?
10:25:46 <goron> rt: If you want high performace code, use Happy. If you want to be done quickly, use Parsec...
10:25:57 <goron> er performance.
10:28:47 <rt> well, performance is always an issue, but not a critical one.  I'm writing assembler as an experiment in Haskell, and was looking for guidance.
10:29:11 <rt> There would seem to be a lower learning curve for Happy, since I've used Yacc for years.
10:36:04 <SyntaxNinja> rt: they're both good :)
10:36:30 <SyntaxNinja> rt: you'll learn a lot either way. happy will be a bit more familiar, but parsec would help you to learn a bit about monads
10:39:56 <_metaperl> SyntaxNinja: do you mind telling us why you left Aetion for Galois?
10:50:35 <SyntaxNinja> _metaperl: in the US it's common to sign an agreement saying that you won't talk about a company for a year after you've left it.
10:50:46 <_metaperl> SyntaxNinja: oh
10:55:31 <SyntaxNinja> _metaperl: check your msgs
10:56:46 <xerox> Hey, check this out.  It is another soc project (demo): http://www.blender.org/bf/apedrop_divx.avi
10:56:50 <xerox> Isn't it awesome?
10:59:37 <_metaperl> xerox: short, but certainly neat
10:59:43 <_metaperl> was it done in Haskell?
11:00:58 <xerox> _metaperl: I think not :-)
11:06:14 <dcoutts> shapr!
11:06:17 <shapr> hiya!
11:06:33 <dcoutts> he's back! and this time he's wearing a hat!
11:06:49 <shapr> TheHunter: Hey, I just got some Sennheisers, model PC 160, they're nice!
11:06:57 <dcoutts> xerox, that is indeed a cool video
11:07:55 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: !
11:07:59 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: y0!
11:13:54 <shapr> What's going on?
11:15:17 <xerox> :-D
11:15:27 <xerox> Check this out:
11:15:34 <xerox> http://www.blender.org/bf/apedrop_divx.avi
11:16:28 <shapr> mikael: Hey, you got mentioned on LtU today!
11:16:36 <xerox> It's another SoC project.  Fluid Simulations with the Lattice Boltzmann Method.
11:16:56 <mikael> shapr: oh yeah, I noticed :-)
11:17:23 <shapr> xerox: nifty!
11:19:35 <shapr> dcoutts: Do you use audioscrobbler?
11:21:18 <dcoutts> shapr, never heard of it
11:22:03 <xerox> I used to have an account there.
11:22:48 <rt> cool flud simulation.
11:22:53 <rt> err.. fluid.
11:23:01 * shapr simulates fud
11:23:11 <shapr> hiya rt, how's the pixels treating you?
11:23:29 * rt shrugs.
11:23:31 <rt> boring day today.
11:27:22 <shapr> Sure is quiet here today.
11:27:34 <ndm___> its bank holiday in england
11:27:42 <shapr> Oh, that explains it.
11:27:43 <ndm___> its pretty quite all over here
11:28:06 <dcoutts> it's a bank holiday! grr, no one told me that.
11:28:19 <ndm___> i went into the department, but left at 12:30 because i was lonely...
11:30:26 <rt> i'm thinking of writing a 6502 assembler for my first real haskell project.
11:30:50 <shapr> Sounds like fun.
11:31:02 <ndm___> rt, i had a friend do that in haskell, quite doable - quite a good project
11:31:25 <rt> seems small enough to be doable, complex enough to be instructive.
11:31:37 <rt> and useful (I want to use it to write some code for the atari 2600 ;-)
11:31:48 <ndm___> oh, binary io
11:31:57 <ndm___> it just doesn't really work with haskell...
11:32:06 <ndm___> rt, are you a win or linux user?
11:32:16 <rt> hex output would be okay.
11:32:25 <rt> linux.
11:32:32 <ndm___> if you write 10 on win, you get 13 10
11:32:38 <ndm___> on linux it actually works properly
11:33:44 <rt> first step: get a parser going.   Anybody else want to weigh in on the "happy vs. parsec" question?
11:34:22 <ndm___> for assembler? you can probably handwrite one faster
11:34:39 <ndm___> use words, then a basic filter
11:34:41 <shapr> rt: Parsec is the easiest way to get going.
11:34:44 <rt> life is too short to write parsers by hand.
11:34:46 <ndm___> lines first of course
11:35:00 <ndm___> for assembler, if its anything that simple, its probably easiest
11:35:25 <Akshaal> rt: :)
11:35:25 <rt> it's only easy as long as your language remains small.
11:40:18 <rt> is parsec easier if you already are good at using yacc?
11:41:40 <shapr> rt: It'll take you about ten minutes to get comfy with Parsec.
11:43:09 <ndm___> rt, if you are used to yacc then happy is yacc for haskell
11:43:35 <ndm___> shapr, could you recommend a parsec tutorial or soemthing?
11:43:45 <shapr> Sure, just a moment...
11:43:51 <ndm___> i've been meaning to get comfy with parsec for ages, and i can certainly spare 10 mins :)
11:44:10 <shapr> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/download/parsec/parsec.html
11:44:32 <shapr> Parser combinators is definitely Haskell's most obvious killer app.
11:46:16 <shapr> If you want to see Parsec put to good use, check out Peter Simons' hsemail lib: http://cryp.to/hsemail/
11:46:27 <shapr> It includes parsers for RFC2234, RFC2821, and RFC2822
11:48:36 <shapr> TheHunter: One day, when I can afford it, I'll get some electrostatic transducer Sennheisers.
11:57:26 <basti_> hi
11:57:51 <shapr> y0
12:01:45 <Beelsebob> evening all
12:01:56 <shapr> hiya, how's code?
12:02:11 <Beelsebob> not bad... unicycling's more fun though
12:02:33 <shapr> You could write unicycle code.
12:02:49 <Beelsebob> I could... but I know a man doing that already
12:03:11 <shapr> Ulph came up with an excellent control system, and I came up with a neat unicycle game concept.
12:03:29 <Beelsebob> uhhuh? Chunky may well be interested to hear from you
12:03:39 <Beelsebob> because he already has the graphics and physics engine
12:03:49 * shapr is interested!
12:03:52 <Beelsebob> hang on
12:04:44 * Beelsebob is trying to get him to join
12:04:58 <shapr> Get him to join #unicycling
12:09:54 <FrederikEaton> is there an unsafeCoerce in the standard libraries?
12:10:14 <greenrd> Why would you want that?
12:10:17 * ski thinks no
12:10:29 <FrederikEaton> i need to define a new cast
12:10:39 <basti_> a cast?
12:10:40 <ski> for ?
12:10:56 <FrederikEaton> for the CIA, bitches. top s3kr3t
12:11:17 <FrederikEaton> cast1 :: DataType -> a -> Maybe (b c)
12:11:20 <FrederikEaton> something like that
12:11:30 <basti_> o0
12:11:45 <FrederikEaton> well getting rid of the first argument if possible, which is just dataTypeOf the (b c) type
12:12:37 <basti_> you're sure that you want a higher order function type in there?
12:12:56 <FrederikEaton> hmm?
12:13:11 <basti_> (Maybe b c) you mean?
12:14:27 <FrederikEaton> Maybe takes 1 argument
12:14:42 <basti_> oh yes i was thinking Either sorry.
12:14:44 <xerox> So 'b' is an 'm'
12:14:47 <ski> @kind Maybe
12:14:52 <lambdabot> * -> *
12:14:55 <shapr> hiya wli, how's code?
12:14:56 <basti_> b is a higher order function then
12:15:04 <xerox> basti_: it's a parametric type
12:15:16 <basti_> ok.
12:16:29 <basti_> FrederikEaton: if DataType has some (b c) inside, then you should be able to "cast" it to Maybe (b c)
12:17:28 <xerox> Wrap?
12:17:31 * ski wonders what the definition of DataType is
12:17:34 <FrederikEaton> hmm?
12:17:35 <FrederikEaton> regular cast doesn't work because 'c' is unspecified, i'm only casting the 'b' part
12:17:41 <basti_> o0
12:17:52 <FrederikEaton> i just changed the type to: cast1 :: a -> Maybe (b c)
12:17:56 <ski> FrederikEaton ; you want  f a -> g a  ?
12:20:29 <FrederikEaton> no
12:20:49 <FrederikEaton> cast1 :: (Data a, Data (b c)) => a -> Maybe (b c)
12:20:49 <FrederikEaton> cast1 x = r
12:20:49 <FrederikEaton>   where
12:20:49 <FrederikEaton>     r = if dataTypeName (dataTypeOf x) == dataTypeName (dataTypeOf (get r))
12:20:49 <FrederikEaton>         then Just (unsafeCoerce# x)
12:20:52 <FrederikEaton>         else Nothing
12:20:54 <FrederikEaton>     get :: Maybe a -> a
12:20:57 <FrederikEaton>     get x = undefined
12:20:59 <FrederikEaton> the above seems to type check
12:21:07 <basti_> :-O
12:22:41 <FrederikEaton> i don't know yet if it solves my problem though
12:23:07 <basti_> i would say "no".
12:23:20 <goron> basti_: Hey, me too :D
12:23:44 <Lemmih> When will coercing 'a' to 'b c' be a good idea?
12:24:48 <basti_> FrederikEaton: whats the big picture on that?
12:26:27 <FrederikEaton> unify :: (Term a, Term b) => a -> b -> LP ()
12:26:33 <FrederikEaton> calls unifyVar :: (Term a, Term b) => Var a -> b -> LP ()
12:26:53 <FrederikEaton> oh, where a Term is a Data
12:27:27 <FrederikEaton> but in order to take a value of Data and cast it to a polymorphic value of (Var a) I need a new cast function
12:28:35 <basti_> hmm
12:29:04 <FrederikEaton> now i have:
12:29:05 <FrederikEaton>     Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
12:29:05 <FrederikEaton>       `Data a' arising from use of `cast1' at GenLogVar.hs:95:19-23
12:29:25 <FrederikEaton> is there some compiler option that gets rid of this? it's my last error
12:31:13 <ski> you want to convert a value of type 'a' into a value of type 'Var a' (where 'Data a') ?
12:32:13 <FrederikEaton> uh, but where you use more than just the letter 'a'
12:32:30 <ski> by which you mean ?
12:32:41 * basti_ cannot follow at all
12:32:52 <FrederikEaton> if you try to convert 'a' to 'Var a' then you'll get an infinite type
12:33:11 <FrederikEaton> i want to convert 'a' to 'Var b' where 'Data b'
12:33:12 <ski> *why* you do want to convert from 'a' to 'Var a' ?
12:33:16 <ski> hm
12:33:21 <basti_> blupp a = Var a
12:33:26 <ski> *why* convert ?
12:33:28 <basti_> or s/a/x/ for that
12:33:39 <basti_> yes, *why* is what i'm asking myself too
12:34:03 <ski> FrederikEaton : you are borrowing some of this from Ljunglöf's paper, yes ?
12:34:29 <FrederikEaton> why? i'm writing a generic typed logical variables thing. ski: yes
12:34:51 * FrederikEaton has to go!
12:34:54 <ski> i still don't see why you think you need to convert in this way
12:34:55 <ski> ok
12:34:57 <ski> cya later
12:36:14 <basti_> cu fe
12:36:41 <ski> que ?
12:37:02 <basti_> fe = FrederikEaton
13:06:23 * boegel|home greets everyone in #haskell
13:07:49 <basti_> hi boegel
13:08:36 <goron> If I think the whole idea of filter and filterM is essentially the same, and it should just be called filter. Would I need generic Haskell then, or are there other extensions of Haskell which can do this kind of stuff?
13:10:11 <roconnor> help, I can't get ghc to complie with profiling on.
13:10:25 <roconnor> ./CReal.hs:
13:10:26 <roconnor>     Can't find module `Control.Exception'
13:10:28 <roconnor>     (use -v to see a list of the files searched for)
13:12:14 <basti__> roconnor: whats the problem
13:12:29 <roconnor> It can't find imported library modules
13:12:32 <roconnor> when I use -prof
13:12:43 <goron> roconnor: And you did compile from cvs and you said you wanted the profile libraries?
13:12:44 <basti__> hm :/
13:12:51 <basti__> did you install the profiling version of ghc?
13:12:53 <roconnor> god no
13:12:58 <roconnor> what
13:13:06 <goron> roconnor: Well, there you have the problem..
13:13:25 <goron> roconnor: What OS?
13:13:47 <roconnor> I'll get ghc6-prof from debian then.
13:13:57 <basti_> yes
13:14:02 <basti_> that might be a wise thing to do
13:14:11 <roconnor> :-)
13:14:23 <goron> roconnor: That's faster than compiling it from source.
13:14:40 <roconnor> someday error messages will say, ``you need to install ghc6-prof''
13:15:02 <basti_> i doubt we'll see this day.
13:15:08 <roconnor> true
13:15:09 <goron> roconnor: Someday you won't use a computer anymore via text-interface.
13:15:16 <basti_> why not?
13:15:19 <basti_> whats bad about text?
13:15:35 <goron> basti_: Do you see managers use a computer?
13:15:45 <goron> basti_: Do they program every bit?
13:15:54 <basti_> ?
13:15:55 <goron> basti_: No, they just tell someone to do it.
13:16:08 <basti_> i hear that kind of argument often.
13:16:15 <basti_> actually, some people take pride in doing things.
13:16:27 <goron> basti_: Ofcourse people take pride.
13:16:30 <basti_> EVERYONE can tell someone else to do something
13:16:39 <goron> basti_: It's non-trivial sometimes.
13:16:39 <basti_> thats why managers and politicans are the worst scum of all
13:16:54 <roconnor> yay 60% spent in one function.
13:17:10 <goron> basti_: But that's only because we don't have a magical machine that creates everything for us.
13:17:14 <basti_> theres no point in "managing" something if you actually can do something that makes sense
13:17:25 <basti_> yes, but computers will never be a magical machine
13:17:44 <goron> basti_: Well, substitute magical for smart.
13:17:58 <goron> basti_: It will take a lot of time still....
13:18:05 <Spark> if you understand how to make a machine like that, you already understand how to create the perfect utopia, with or without machinery
13:18:17 <basti_> they will not be "smart" either, until something very revolutionary happens
13:18:25 <goron> basti_: I know.
13:18:46 <goron> basti_: Well, anyway that's what I think is an interesting problem to solve...
13:18:52 <basti_> and if they would be, that would be humanities doom, i'm pretty sure
13:18:52 <basti_> ;)
13:19:02 <basti_> imagine, noone ever having to THINK!
13:19:04 <goron> basti_: sure
13:19:10 <basti_> we would degenerate to managers!
13:19:18 <goron> basti_: That happens everyday for some people.
13:19:23 <goron> basti_: er a lot of people.
13:19:29 <basti_> the world sucks, yes.
13:19:41 <goron> basti_: We have reached agreement.
13:19:44 <basti_> ;)
13:19:47 <goron> :P
13:20:24 <goron> basti_: Still I think a lot of the components for a good AI are inplace.
13:20:37 <basti_> but the intelligence is still not there
13:20:39 <goron> Only a good power source is absent.
13:20:41 <basti_> so something is missing
13:21:08 <goron> basti_: yes.
13:21:20 <SyntaxNinja> @seen shapr
13:21:22 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell. Last spoke 1 hour, 6 minutes and 25 seconds
13:21:22 <lambdabot> ago.
13:21:22 <goron> basti_: Complete designs are also missing.
13:21:41 <basti_> yes.
13:21:57 <vegai> so the only thing that is in place is silicon?
13:21:58 <goron> basti_: But some poeple claimed to have designed an optimal agent already.
13:22:06 <goron> vegai: hehe
13:22:07 <Spark> the notion of humanity would be irrelevent once we can understand omnipotent machines :)
13:22:16 <basti_> goron: uhm?
13:22:48 <basti_> goron: as in "turing test"?
13:23:06 <goron> basti_:        A Theory of Universal Artiï¬cial Intelligence
13:23:06 <goron> 2000
13:23:06 <goron>                    based on Algorithmic Complexity
13:23:17 <goron> basti_: Like that.
13:23:26 <basti_> afaik that does not mean "i can program an intelligent program"
13:23:26 <goron> basti_: But there are a few more.
13:23:33 <goron> basti_: no, it doesn't.
13:23:42 <basti_> that does just mean "i believe i know something about intelligence"
13:23:46 <goron> basti_: They first had a theory about planes too, you know?
13:23:49 <basti_> yup
13:24:02 <basti_> but theres a difference, in planes, the problem and the means were known
13:24:09 <goron> basti_: AI requires gigantic amounts of computing.
13:24:12 <basti_> problem = staying up, means = aerodynamics
13:24:19 <goron> basti_: It's like "off the scale".
13:24:31 <basti_> yes, but how far?
13:24:38 <basti_> centuries?
13:24:48 <goron> basti_: I'd guess this century.
13:25:14 <basti_> we'll see
13:25:19 <basti_> maybe
13:25:27 <goron> basti_: It depends on a zillion things, ofcourse.
13:25:33 <roconnor> heh, now it's over 2x faster
13:25:43 <basti_> yes like, people not nuking each other before
13:25:45 <goron> roconnor: But still damn slow?
13:25:51 <roconnor> yep
13:25:54 <roconnor> I think
13:26:23 <roconnor> I spent a week writing some code, then I found some existing code that is half the size and 10x faster
13:26:45 <tromp> i suggest you keep halving it:)
13:26:48 <roconnor> profining really helps
13:27:06 <goron> How could I do this better? (reverse.tail.dropWhile ((/=) '.'). reverse)
13:27:07 <goron>                  where extension = (reverse.takeWhile((/=) '.') .reverse) filePath
13:27:08 <roconnor> my top funtion at 60% of the time droped to 9% of the time.
13:27:50 <goron> I am worried these kind of constructions will kill performance over an entire application.
13:28:11 <goron> In an imperative language, the algorithm would be different and more efficient.
13:29:03 <goron> Or is the compiler smart enough to merge these two steps?
13:29:14 <goron> I don't think it is....
13:29:29 <roconnor> you can merge that by using some form of split?
13:29:38 <basti_> goron: maybe you should rewrite takeWhile?
13:30:13 <basti_> it will never be better than O(n) though
13:30:32 <goron> basti_: Well, I could write the imperative version of it using recursion and then relying on tail-recursion...
13:30:47 <goron> (the optimization)
13:31:09 <basti_> just to avoid those two reverses
13:32:38 <goron> basti_: Well, there are a million ways to write this code more efficient. I'd say there's no issue.
13:33:05 <basti_> so maybe you just write "fromLast :: a->[a]->[a]"?
13:34:32 <goron> I don't really get your point... a function like split::a->[a]->([a],[a]) would make sense though...
13:35:18 <basti_> i mean reverse.takewhile.reverse would be like "takefromlast"
13:35:31 <basti_> but you could write it a lot better than reverse.takewhile.reverse
13:36:04 <goron> basti_: Well, actually I like that construction (syntactically seen)
13:36:33 <basti_> theres a tradeoff between "i like it" and "it's fast" in most languages, i fear
13:36:40 <goron> It's an extremely simple and robust solution.
13:36:52 <goron> basti_: yes, that's true.
13:37:11 <basti_> i see the advantages, though.
13:37:29 <goron> basti_: I was about to explain them to you.. Thanks :)
13:37:37 <roconnor> let ext x = if (null x) then ([],[]) else let (a,b)=(ext (tail x)) in if (null b) && ((head x)=='.') then (b,a) else ((head x):a,b)
13:37:41 <roconnor> in 1-d notation.
13:38:04 <roconnor> ext "foooooo.bar"
13:38:05 <roconnor> ("foooooo","bar")
13:38:05 <basti_> -g-
13:38:23 <basti_> we had a very easy split lately
13:38:39 <goron> ext "foo.foo.bar"
13:38:48 <roconnor> ext "foo.oooo.bar"
13:38:49 <roconnor> ("foo.oooo","bar")
13:38:53 <mflux> btw, I prefer to split with the extension, this way foo. and foo can be disambiguated
13:39:14 <roconnor> I'll leave that as an exercise.
13:39:34 <goron> It would be pretty neat if lambdabot could take these kind of function definitions....
13:40:13 <basti_> @pl ((groupBy (const (/='.'))).('.':)) "akjsd.aksj.asjd"
13:40:15 <lambdabot> groupBy (const ('.' /=)) ".akjsd.aksj.asjd"
13:40:19 <basti_> wah
13:40:22 <basti_> @plugs ((groupBy (const (/='.'))).('.':)) "akjsd.aksj.asjd"
13:40:28 <lambdabot> [".akjsd",".aksj",".asjd"]
13:40:37 <xerox> ahah, that function again!
13:40:41 <basti_> yup!
13:42:19 <roconnor> This must be an instance of scanl or something.
13:52:03 <basti_> mflux: btw. ["filename"] and ["filename",""] would be different too.
14:11:25 <shapr> salut jkrs
14:11:34 <shapr> Are you learning Haskell?
14:11:48 <jkrs> hi. yes. difficult start
14:12:01 <shapr> Do you have any questions?
14:12:09 <shapr> Would you like pointers to tutorials?
14:12:47 <jkrs> yes thanks. but really simple. i'm from java world
14:12:59 <Narrenschiff> I hear they eat horses there!
14:13:11 <shapr> Ok, here's a simple start: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
14:13:28 <jkrs> thanks. looking
14:13:57 <shapr> Once you've read that, I'd suggest Hal Daume's "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial". You can find that tutorial listd here: http://www.haskell.org/learning.html along with a bunch of other introductory info.
14:14:48 <jkrs> thanks alot. looks like a rich source
14:15:05 <shapr> jkrs: The richest source is here on #haskell. If you have any questions, feel free to ask here.
14:15:40 <shapr> There's lots of good Haskell code worth reading, lambdabot is a good example.
14:16:15 <Beelsebob> hmm, possibly not a good idea when you're just learning though
14:16:31 <Beelsebob> it takes a while to get a good enough grounding to understand what's going on
14:17:03 <Beelsebob> brb
14:17:18 <jkrs> true. getting the head around functional prog is gymnastic
14:18:07 <shapr> Silly question, does anyone have a gmail invite?
14:18:56 <rasfar> gmail invite? sure
14:19:18 <jkrs> heard invites are no longer needed by mobile phone
14:19:31 <shapr> oh
14:20:10 <jkrs> http://mobile.google.com/
14:20:15 <xerox> shapr: urgh, why?
14:20:32 <xerox> BTW, yes, but could I ask you why?
14:20:35 <ndm> shapr, yep, 50
14:21:42 <rasfar> why not?
14:21:50 <xerox> Aww.
14:22:17 <mikehammad> how do i import the ST constructor?
14:22:26 <shapr> @index ST
14:22:27 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.ST.Lazy, Control.Monad.ST, Control.Monad.ST.Strict
14:22:48 * shapr hugs Beelsebob 
14:23:09 <mikehammad> doh, not in those
14:23:12 <dcoutts> mikehammad, (btw, you probably mean the ST Type or ST module not the constructor)
14:23:29 <mikehammad> i'm doing some low-level hacking here
14:24:11 <mikehammad> so i need to use writeDoubleArray#
14:24:23 <dcoutts> mikehammad, ah, the ST constructor is probably not exported. If you really want to go low level you can probably get it from a GHC.Something module, but don't do it if you can avoid it! :-)
14:24:47 <mikehammad> this is unfortunate...i'm writing a matrix library
14:25:00 <mikehammad> but the performance is horrible with the standard unsafe* functions
14:25:50 <mikehammad> i've written a base case generator that makes inline code...it should be fast, but it's many times slower than C or even Clean
14:25:51 <TheHunter> @type GHC.Base.ST
14:25:56 <lambdabot> bzzt
14:26:25 <dcoutts> mikehammad, and you're using ghc -O2 and all that stuff?
14:26:41 <mikehammad> yea, ghc -O turned out to be fastest
14:26:54 <dcoutts> there was a discussion recently on the ghc bus list about optimising some simple loop stuff, comparing the speed vs the C version
14:27:02 <dcoutts> bus/bugs
14:27:14 <dcoutts> I think I started it :-)
14:27:25 <dcoutts> one of the Simons posted a detailed reply
14:27:29 <mikehammad> basically, i'm inlining a matrix-matrix multiplication.  the ops are very simple, but it seems like tons of thunks are geneated
14:27:32 <TheHunter> @type GHC.ST.ST
14:27:34 <lambdabot> forall a s. GHC.ST.STRep s a -> GHC.ST.ST s a
14:27:38 <dcoutts> you might find some useful examples there
14:27:57 <shapr> mikehammad: Could you strictify your datatype?
14:28:13 <greenrd> mikehammad: It seems that Haskell is very thunky. Perhaps it is not the right tool for the job?
14:28:17 <mikehammad> the datatype is unboxed double arrays
14:28:19 <shapr> Then you could use the unpack strict fields thingy.
14:29:06 <mikehammad> i'm not really using any data declarations
14:29:07 <dcoutts> greenrd, it is possible to write low level code, it's just rather tricky and ghc-specific
14:29:43 <dcoutts> mikehammad, really, check out the loop discussion, it was all about unboxed arrays etc and thunks & looping
14:29:46 <mikehammad> all my index types are Int, and the arrays are unboxed
14:29:51 <mikehammad> cool, have a link?
14:30:02 <dcoutts> search on the ghc bugs list
14:30:05 <shapr> TheHunter: This Sennheiser 160 PC rocks, these are the best headphones I've ever had.
14:30:12 <dcoutts> it was probably a month or two ago
14:30:59 <mikael> shapr: do those wrap around your ears or rest against them?
14:31:10 <mikehammad> hmm i'm failing to find anything
14:31:25 <shapr> mikael: halfway between both choices
14:33:54 <mikehammad> should it be here? http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=8032&atid=108032
14:34:27 <shapr> mikael: I guess they rest on my ear mostly.
14:34:40 <lispy`> shapr: do you wear glasses?
14:34:54 <shapr> lispy`: Yeah, but that doesn't matter, my glasses don't have earpieces.
14:35:06 <lispy`> shapr: oh, hi morpheous :)
14:35:18 <shapr> heh, not quite like that...
14:35:40 <lispy`> shapr: i find that ear buds are the only head phones that don't aggrivate my glasses
14:35:51 <Itkovian> shapr: are yr galsses pierced through yr nose then?
14:35:59 <Itkovian> glasses
14:36:28 <lispy`> ear buds are not exactly painful, or high quality sound
14:36:32 <shapr> Nah, lemme find the website with pix.
14:36:47 <lispy`> er "not exactly painLESS"
14:37:19 <lispy`> i have some now that clip on to the top of my hear and are otherwise normal headphones.  Those are alright, but after 1-2 hours they start to hurt
14:37:31 <rasfar> I have to wrap them around my ears to keep them in (buds)!
14:37:59 <lispy`> yeah, earbuds can be a pain
14:38:21 <rasfar> I keep telling myself to buy cups -- must be a masochistic streak...
14:40:19 <dcoutts> mikehammad, http://www.mail-archive.com/glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org/msg07082.html
14:40:36 <shapr> lispy`: http://www.staffanpreutz.com/images/Hoger1.gif
14:40:51 <dcoutts> mikehammad, that's the start of the thread, Simon Peyton-Jones's reply is the most helpful
14:41:19 * Beelsebob hugs shapr
14:41:24 <Beelsebob> sorry, was on the phone
14:41:33 <lispy`> shapr: is that a suction cup?
14:42:12 <shapr> lispy`: check out the low quality movie - http://www.staffanpreutz.com/Movie/movie.wmv
14:43:15 <TheHunter> shapr, that sounds like a nice headphone.
14:43:39 <TheHunter> I just wish I had a better-quality analog sound output here..
14:44:29 <shapr> TheHunter: Probably not as good as 550s, but I bought these to combine VoIP with listening quality, so I got what I wanted.
14:44:35 <lispy`> dcoutts: thanks for the link.  Looks like the bug i submitted never made it in
14:44:50 <dcoutts> lispy`, what bug was that?
14:45:17 <lispy`> dcoutts: bug with forkOS, not catching exceptions and then getting bad activation records
14:45:55 <lispy`> it was at least one week ago, maybe two
14:45:56 <mikehammad> dcoutts: ok thanks :)
14:46:23 <TheHunter> shapr, does it have an usb input?
14:47:14 <dcoutts> mikehammad, and the options for looking at ghc intermediate code are also explained in that thread (I think). They are useful for analysing performance issues. You can also look at the generated C code (if you can make sense of it).
14:47:40 <shapr> Nah, I considered the 550 USB, but that was 1036 kronor instead of 710 kronor for the 650 analog.
14:48:00 <mikehammad> yea the problem was the generated C code was enormous, and hard to read
14:48:10 <lispy`> shapr: interesting, after watching that i feel like i need to take a shower ;)
14:48:23 <shapr> heh, why?
14:48:34 <lispy`> shapr: nothing specific, just a weird video :)
14:48:36 <dcoutts> mikehammad, and if you find anything that you think ghc is doing badly then you can submit them as ghc bugs. They've been focusing on performance recently. They had a ghc performance-fest a few weeks ago.
14:48:39 <mikehammad> i'm just assuming that new thunks get generated between each read and write to the array
14:48:58 <TheHunter> hmm,
14:49:05 <TheHunter> @google 1035 kronor in euro
14:49:06 <lambdabot> No result found.
14:49:34 <shapr> @eval 1035 / 0.9
14:49:36 <lambdabot> 1150.0
14:49:39 <shapr> umm
14:49:43 * boegel|home leaves for bed (had neighbours over for a drink, waaaay past my bedtime)
14:49:47 <boegel|home> g'night everyone
14:49:48 <shapr> g'night boegel|home
14:50:01 <TheHunter> 1 035 Swedish kronor = 110.915566 Euro
14:50:07 <shapr> Ah, ok.
14:50:24 <lispy`> boegel|home: good night
14:50:44 <Beelsebob> and make sure you get those .5566Â¢
14:51:25 <TheHunter> i wish they had had usb headphones back when I bought mine. That seems like such a good idea.
14:51:34 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: the twisting tower looks cool, have you seen it?
14:51:41 <shapr> Nah, what's that?
14:51:52 <SyntaxNinja> http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/08/27/sweden.skyscraper.ap/index.html
14:51:57 <lispy`> @eval 5/9 + 0.01*(6/9) - 0.01*(5/9) - (0.0001)*(6/9)
14:51:59 <lambdabot> 0.5566000000000001
14:52:03 <shapr> TheHunter: They have some wireless headphones now, they look nice.
14:52:11 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: and look at your msgs
14:52:17 <lispy`> stupid round off errors
14:52:27 <lispy`> @eval (5/9 + 0.01*(6/9) - 0.01*(5/9) - (0.0001)*(6/9))*0.0001
14:52:28 <lambdabot> 5.566000000000001e-5
14:53:14 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: there appears to be a cone of silence btween us.  bizzare.
14:53:20 <shapr> weird
14:53:27 <SyntaxNinja> maybe this explains why _metaperl was ignoring my msgs earlier
14:53:39 <shapr> Wait, are you not identified to nickserv?
14:53:41 <_metaperl> I am here
14:53:48 <_metaperl> but metaperl is my home nick
14:53:49 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: yeah, did the rulz change or something?
14:54:05 <_metaperl> there is no way to take over my home nick at work and then relinquish it when I get back home is there?
14:54:06 <shapr> Yeah, since the porn spam flood yesterday.
14:54:13 <SyntaxNinja> bugger
14:54:17 <shapr> _metaperl: Yeah, you can, sort of.
14:54:22 <lispy`> SyntaxNinja: you have to login with nickserv
14:54:23 <_metaperl> oh.... I put on +E
14:54:23 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, _metaperl I was messaging you earlier
14:54:26 <_metaperl> that's why
14:54:26 <SyntaxNinja> yeahyea, OK
14:54:37 <lispy`> it's part of lilo's master plan to make freenode annoying to use
14:54:38 <_metaperl> shucks... is the porn flood over?
14:54:50 <lispy`> yeah, i didn't get a single message
14:54:59 <lispy`> not a single spambot came to bug me
14:55:00 <TheHunter> lambdabot doesn't reply to my msgs either.
14:55:14 <lispy`> you have to login to nickserv
14:55:16 <lambdabot> blub
14:55:24 <_metaperl> so I just need to do "msg +e metaperl" to set it back?
14:55:26 <Beelsebob> :o
14:55:38 <shapr> _metaperl: /mode metaperl -E
14:55:51 <shapr> I think...
14:55:52 * Beelsebob has to wonder what the point of sending a probe to pluto and the kupler belt is... if they expect it to return in 50000 years
14:55:56 <TheHunter> i am logged in.
14:56:03 <integral> http://freenode.net/news.shtml might explain lambdabot if it's not registered
14:56:27 <shapr> lambdabot is registered, but not identified. I forgot his password...
14:56:50 <Beelsebob> although an interesting project for archiologists in 50,000 years...
14:57:05 <Beelsebob> wtf... there's a probe in an alien language coming towards earth
14:57:07 <lispy> Beelsebob: maybe it will find oil
14:57:16 <rasfar> Um, speaking of lambdabot -- I'm just trying to build for the first time.
14:57:24 <TheHunter> oh, great.
14:57:25 <rasfar> I have a sorta dumb question.
14:57:29 <Beelsebob> lispy: what's the point if it takes 50k years
14:57:40 <lispy> TheHunter: i sent you a message, did you get it?
14:57:51 <TheHunter> lispy, got it.
14:57:59 <lispy> Beelsebob: we'd be able to communicate in the mean time i hope
14:58:06 <Beelsebob> I hope so
14:58:06 <rasfar> Why does autoconf complain "configure.in: No such file or directory"?
14:58:13 <lispy> TheHunter: okay, i didn't get a reply, so i guess you can't send?
14:58:33 <lispy> worked that time
14:58:38 <mikehammad> dcoutts: hmm, you used the IOUArray, but I use STUArray.  should there be a difference?
14:59:04 * TheHunter joins #haskell on OFTC
14:59:05 <dcoutts> mikehammad, they should have the same space/time charactersitics
14:59:31 <rasfar> Seems strange, the build instructions were posted by dons, and I *am* runnign OpenBSD...
14:59:34 <dcoutts> mikehammad, only difference is that one is in the ST monad, the other in IO
14:59:50 <TheHunter> rasfar, you need auto_re_conf
15:00:00 <dcoutts> mikehammad, however in ghc at least, the IO monad is implemented using the same underlying stuff as the ST monad
15:00:12 <mikehammad> that what i expect
15:00:13 <rasfar> TheHunter, thanks I'll look into it.
15:00:26 <mikehammad> man this is weird... my program is still slow
15:00:50 <lispy> mikehammad: are you using the optimizer at all?
15:01:02 <lispy> mikehammad: i've found that using arrays is painful in haskell
15:01:05 <mikehammad> peyton jones used  -fliberate-case-threshold=100 and it seemed to do the trick
15:01:09 <lispy> performance wise, even IOUArray
15:01:24 <mikehammad> i'm using -O2
15:01:58 <dcoutts> lispy, I find it just takes some fiddling and tuning. I've got programs to speed up from taking 5 min to 5 sec by using the IOUArray stuff
15:02:02 <lispy> mikehammad: you might want to sty IOArray just to see if the boxing can give better performance.  Philippa told me once that it can help if you are walking the array often.
15:02:32 <dcoutts> lispy, seems unlikely for an array of Doubles
15:02:44 <lispy> dcoutts: i did get a big increase from using IOUArray, but the C version was still much faster
15:03:22 <mikehammad> lispy: you got a speed increase using IO over ST?
15:03:38 <lispy> mikehammad: by using IOUArray over Array
15:03:40 <dcoutts> lispy, yeah, in the thread mentioned above, the C version was still 4 times faster (but that was for a very trivial loop, the difference gets less for more complex stuff)
15:04:16 <dcoutts> in the program I mentioned where I got a 60x speedup, the final version ws only half the speed of a highly tuned C version
15:05:03 <mikehammad> still, half of C speed would be a  huge improvement for me
15:05:13 <lispy> dcoutts: my goal was to do interactive opengl programming.  I'm not convince haskell can give the performance needed for that sort of realtime interaction
15:05:46 <luqui> lispy, What sort of programming?
15:05:47 <lispy> in the end i went with a solution that didn't even write to an array
15:05:54 <shapr> lispy: OpenGL will be your speed limiter there.
15:06:03 <luqui> I mean, what sort of program
15:06:13 <lispy> luqui: so far i've only played with demos
15:06:16 <shapr> Did you see Simon Marlow's Haskell OpenGL code that was just as fast as the C code?
15:06:22 <lispy> @where lispy-nehe
15:06:23 <lambdabot> I know nothing about lispy-nehe.
15:06:35 <Beelsebob> shapr: you sure? Usually my graphics code is CPU bound, not GPU
15:06:37 <lispy> seems i've been erase from lambdabot
15:06:43 <lispy> shapr: no i didn't
15:06:52 <shapr> Beelsebob: Lemme find the thread..
15:06:57 * luqui has written OpenGL games in Perl, and the speed is not a problem until you get to a certain complexity
15:07:14 <Beelsebob> luqui: that's possibly it
15:07:14 <luqui> really, no need to be fast most of the time, because OpenGL primitives these days can push a lot of the load onto the gpu
15:07:49 <Beelsebob> iff you write it well
15:07:58 <Beelsebob> and writing it well depends on the GL implementation
15:08:04 <luqui> the real limiting factor for Perl was the sub call overhead
15:08:14 <luqui> and I think haskell does a lot better than perl on that level
15:08:22 <Beelsebob> probably part of why my code was slow actually
15:08:28 <Beelsebob> Obj-C calling overhead
15:08:28 <goron> shapr: Did you actually check SM's code?
15:09:38 <shapr> goron: Nah, but the benchmark numbers were included.
15:12:01 <lispy> haskell is nice, but it will take a lot convince me that it's good for high performance game coding
15:12:23 <lispy> ocaml appears to be a nice midway point tho
15:12:34 <goron> shapr: Well, than you'd have to trust him.... Sure he would look like an idiot if he changed numbers.... but still....
15:13:01 <goron> lispy: Wasn't Lisp good for that? ;)
15:13:15 <lispy> goron: no, absolutely not
15:13:17 <goron> lispy: Jack and Dexter was written in Lisp.
15:13:28 <lispy> ah, but that was a special dialect
15:13:35 <luqui> lispy, first you really need to know whether you're really interested in "high performance"
15:13:39 <luqui> are you really going to write half life 2?
15:13:49 <lispy> the sdl bindings for CL have a lot of issues for one thing
15:14:43 <lispy> luqui: if demos that throw a few polygons on the screen stutter, then there is no hope for anything sophisticated :)
15:14:54 <goron> I wonder what the best compiler in the world is for some definitions of best...
15:14:56 <luqui> lispy, they do?
15:15:03 <luqui> those opengl bindings must suck
15:15:11 <lispy> luqui: http://www.codersbase.com/nehe-tuts
15:15:32 <luqui> well, another thing that I would do with Perl was to write the graphics-heavy stuff in C
15:15:38 <luqui> and then structure the program overall with Perl
15:15:41 <lispy> luqui: i don't find the performance to be very good on my ibook G4 and it plays quake3 quite well
15:15:55 <luqui> worked like a charm -- I found it pretty easy to separate the two
15:15:57 <shapr> goron: I can't find the post, sadly.
15:16:54 <goron> shapr: I have seen the post already.
15:16:55 <lispy> goron: i haven't tried all the C versions of those tuts, but one ones thta give bad haskell performance i've checked against the C version
15:16:59 <lispy> or, soo
15:17:01 <shapr> goron: Where is it?
15:17:02 <lispy> meant that for luqui
15:17:09 <shapr> hoi swiert
15:17:16 <swiert> hi shapr
15:17:21 <shapr> How's code?
15:17:32 <goron> shapr: I could find it for you I think, but I don't have it right next to me, or anything.
15:17:38 <shapr> Ok, no worries.
15:17:39 <swiert> at a stand still. I just got back from Sweden.
15:17:54 <shapr> Were you in the north of Sweden?
15:18:13 <swiert> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/
15:18:27 <swiert> which was good fun.
15:19:08 <shapr> Yeah, chalmers plus types equals fun.
15:19:44 <swiert> Yep. I always find these summer schools to be killing though.
15:19:54 <lispy> oh, and i have found haskell to be faster than lisp in 1) development time 2) run-time
15:20:21 <swiert> Courses though the morning and drinks/social activity at night.
15:20:50 <shapr> alcohol + type theory = massive headache.
15:20:56 <lispy> heh
15:20:59 <Beelsebob> haha
15:21:21 <Beelsebob> I would expect it's more a matter of hangover + type theory = really massive headache
15:22:52 <swiert> yeah - that and lack of sleep will pretty much kill you in two weeks.
15:22:59 <lispy> we need to invent a drink and name it after something in type theory
15:23:14 <shapr> Skolemize
15:23:28 <shapr> The Barendregt Cube
15:23:33 <ndm> we have bitter and vodka, no more drinks are needed
15:23:36 <TheHunter> @index data2tree

15:25:31 * Beelsebob wonders why his client just made an explosion noise
15:26:03 <shapr> Do you smell smoke?
15:26:08 <Beelsebob> nope
15:26:11 <lispy> hmm....
15:26:18 <lispy> did you get shot?
15:26:22 <Beelsebob> I think it was someone being kicked from a room
15:26:44 <shapr> Reminds me of the time I was repairing a computer and lightning came out of it...
15:26:50 <Beelsebob> hehe
15:27:11 <Beelsebob> worst that's happened to me is that I left some of my finger on a chip
15:27:56 <shapr> I was working in a Mac repair shop, we had a Macintosh SE/30 opened up. The symptom was "screen doesn't work right". When we turned it on, purple lightning came out of the flyback transformer that powered the screen. Then we got smoke.
15:28:07 <Beelsebob> haha
15:28:15 <lispy> nice
15:28:18 <Beelsebob> that would be one definition of screen don't work right
15:28:19 <_metaperl> that sounds like a Satanic invocation ritual
15:28:29 <_metaperl> you all were conjuring deities
15:28:47 <lispy> i pulled a PCI 2.0 card out once and the machine powered on when the card was still half-way
15:28:55 <shapr> It was pretty cool, I've never seen purple plasma coming out of a personal computer before or since.
15:28:57 <Beelsebob> metaperl: who would have thought that involved broken 18 year old computers
15:29:05 <xerox> shapr: wow..
15:29:15 <lispy> shapr: nice
15:29:25 <_metaperl> with a name like Beelsebob you might know... just call me Baal
15:29:34 <swiert> shapr: out of mere curiosity, what are you're plans with TMR? And more specifically, is Issue 4 out yet?
15:29:38 <_metaperl> and we can be brothers in Solomons Lesser Seal
15:30:20 <shapr> swiert: I'm moving cities and starting school. If I can't get someone else to take over, TMR will hibernate until I have time to resurrect it.
15:30:30 <luqui> lispy, the nehe-tuts are a lot faster than the C versions for me
15:30:34 <luqui> .... because they just segfault
15:30:48 <swiert> swiert: really - where are you moving and which school?
15:30:54 <lispy> luqui: oh wow
15:31:03 <swiert> (I should read logs)
15:31:03 <lispy> luqui: tell me about your system
15:31:05 <luqui> I'm on amd64 without a terrible stable ghc
15:31:07 <_metaperl> what is the future of Scanned?
15:31:16 <shapr> I'm moving to the next city over, LuleÃ¥, and going to LuleÃ¥ Technical University.
15:31:30 <ndm> if you're going to uni you should have loads of time to do TMR
15:31:30 <luqui> s/terrible/terribly
15:31:35 <ndm> in between hangovers
15:31:37 <shapr> They have the successor to O'Haskell there (Timber), so at least I won't be bored :-)
15:31:59 <lispy> luqui: if you get them to work but it requires a change let me know
15:32:17 <lispy> luqui: fire up one that doesn't require reading a bitmap (so 1-5), does that segfault also?
15:32:19 <swiert> sounds like fun.
15:32:24 <luqui> lispy, yes
15:32:24 <shapr> ndm: Nah, I'm going to stay self-employed and go to uni as well. So I'll actually need to spend more time working to fund my studies.
15:32:37 <ndm> shapr, not so fun i guess
15:32:48 <luqui> so does pugs, which makes me a saaad panda
15:32:52 <lispy> luqui: okay, i would blame your ghc/hopengl
15:33:13 <luqui> is there a decent 6.4 for amd64 yet
15:33:26 <shapr> ndm: Better that starving or leaving the country. I don't want to go back to the USA just yet.
15:33:30 <luqui> as in, has there been significant work done on it in the past 2 months?
15:33:55 <lispy> luqui: is darcs stable on your system?
15:34:14 <shapr> I'd like to do real CS research at some point.
15:34:25 <swiert> shapr: and what about issue four?
15:34:45 <luqui> it seems so, I checked out the nehe-tuts okay
15:34:51 <ndm> shapr, thats often hard to find funding for - especiallly if you want to do something fun
15:35:28 <lispy> luqui: that's good to know, i'm getting an EM64T machine that i wanted to run in 64bit mode :)
15:35:39 <shapr> swiert: Yeah, it's been released... I didn't announce to the mailing lists though.
15:35:41 <lispy> darcs was my main reason to have ghc on hat machine
15:36:02 <lispy> i gotta go
15:36:04 <lispy> ttyl
15:36:30 <swiert> shapr: ah, ok that explains it.
15:36:32 <shapr> swiert: Oleg has an article ready for IssueFive, doesn't look like IssueFive will have five articles either, sadly.
15:37:36 <ndm> shapr, I still have one in progress - expect about 2 months from now
15:38:10 <shapr> Maybe I should go to releasing an issue whenever there are five articles.
15:38:59 <ndm> five articles seems quite a lot
15:39:09 <ndm> if you want to read them it takes quite a long time
15:39:19 <ndm> so maybe fewer articles, 3-4 would be better
15:40:07 <shapr> Maybe so.
15:54:23 <SyntaxNinja> man. this sucks
15:54:40 <Beelsebob> he's brittish
15:54:41 <Beelsebob> I'll come batter on your door
15:54:56 <astrolabe> Might be better :)
15:55:20 <shapr> wel now
15:55:42 * SyntaxNinja was feeling lonely there for a minute

15:57:26 <astrolabe> Oh no.  Presumably freenode uses some COUGH other language.
16:01:50 <Cale> FreeNode seems to have more problems staying together than any of the other IRC networks I've used.
16:02:06 <shapr> We could all move to SILCnet.
16:02:21 <shapr> Anyway, freenode could never be worse than EFNet.
16:02:29 <xerox> heh
16:02:35 <Muad_Dibber> well
16:02:38 <Muad_Dibber> i do not agree Cale. :)
16:02:40 <xerox> I do used silcnet while ago
16:02:54 <Muad_Dibber> but i dont think it improved with hyperion
16:03:22 <Cale> I like the way that it runs while it's running, and the general idea of it
16:03:38 <xerox> But at that time it was populated by a number of people less than a hundred
16:04:12 <xerox> btw, goodnight.
16:04:16 <shapr> g'night xerox
16:04:21 * shapr starts up a silcnet client
16:05:03 <xerox> oh.
16:05:29 <Cale> Couldn't they connect the servers in some configuration which is at least 2-edge connected?
16:05:45 <shapr> Would make sense... or even switch to IPv6 and do multicast...
16:06:12 <xerox> shapr: do you know how to make silc-client out of the deb-src ?
16:06:43 <xerox> oh, np, there a .deb.
16:07:27 <shapr> I'm using silky
16:07:57 <xerox> http://www.silcnet.org/download/client/deb/1.0.1/silc-client_1.0.1-1_i386.deb
16:08:04 <xerox> I did try silky while ago and I didn't really like it
16:08:25 <xerox> But maybe it got better.
16:08:50 <shapr> Are there better options?
16:09:08 <xerox> I'm trying out silc atm
16:09:16 <xerox> it should be a "modified irssi"
16:10:20 <shapr> Ok! haskell has two people on it now!
16:10:27 <xerox> :-D
16:11:29 <ndm> i'm still here
16:12:29 * shapr throws a thunk to ndm 
16:27:10 <xerox> shapr: ping
16:27:14 <shapr> y0
16:27:19 <xerox> Do you read me there?
16:27:24 <shapr> No?
16:27:28 <xerox> Urgh.
16:38:30 <rasfar> If I'm getting "Rebuilding dependencies ... ghc-6.4: unknown package: plugins
16:38:31 <rasfar> ", does that mean I need to install hs-plugins?
16:38:32 <FrederikEaton> shapr: ping
16:38:41 <shapr> y0
16:38:45 <TheHunter> rasfar, yes.
16:38:58 <rasfar> TheHunter: Thanks once again!
16:39:05 <TheHunter> @wiki Lambdabot/Installation
16:39:06 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/Lambdabot/Installation
16:39:14 <TheHunter> that might be a little outdated, though.
16:39:23 <TheHunter> You don't need haskell-source-exts anymore.
16:39:33 <shapr> FrederikEaton: I checked into sending email from the wiki, it wasn't obvious and I haven't had more time to check it out.
16:39:51 <TheHunter> err, http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LambdaBot_2fInstallation
16:40:57 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: another problem w/ your --prefix example is that this how things have worked for ages, as long as ghc-pkg has been around, and it would surely break lots of stuff if we changd the behavior
16:41:10 <rasfar> Wow, lot's of fresh info.  Thanks very much...  (At least this has motivated me to install ghc-6.4.)
16:44:54 <shapr> hej ulph
16:45:00 <ulph> hej shapr!
16:45:06 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: there would have to be some thoughts about backwards compatibility
16:45:17 <shapr> ulph: AnvÃ¤nder du Haskell nufÃ¶rtiden?
16:45:23 <ulph> Hej FrederikEaton !
16:45:24 <FrederikEaton> hey ulf
16:45:45 <ulph> shapr: Ja jag skall skriva en kompilator i Haskell nu fÃ¶r skolan :)
16:46:22 <FrederikEaton> ulph: ok we're regressing here
16:46:29 <shapr> ulph: vad kul
16:46:53 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: fwiw, my current thinking is to work w/ the hugs & nhc guys to figure out what a package system would look like if they had one, and do something more like the --package-conf= that will work with them
16:47:02 <ulph> shapr: ja! jag har fÃ¥tt en labkompis ocksÃ¥, skall bli riktigt social den hÃ¤r terminen :)
16:47:20 <shapr> Vilket sprÃ¥k?
16:47:23 <shapr> hehe
16:47:48 <ulph> FÃ¶r kompilatorn? Det skall vara java till lite olika targets
16:47:55 * lispy pretends to undersand
16:48:02 <ulph> lispy: sorry :)
16:48:23 <lispy> ulph: np, i don't have a problem with it
16:48:26 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: I would like to see an explanation of why a file is used to store package configuration, on the wiki, for reference. it seems like a bad idea.
16:48:31 <lispy> just wish i knew more lanugase
16:48:59 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: a file, as opposed to what?
16:49:03 <ulph> shapr: Jag tycker fortfarande att Haskell Ã¤r lite svÃ¥rt... har inte riktigt kommit in i det.
16:49:30 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: there's nothing actually forcing you to use the ghc-pkg system at all
16:49:30 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: cf the PATH environment variable which contains the database for your executables
16:49:53 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: or which points to a bunch of databases, rather
16:50:03 <SyntaxNinja> I see.
16:50:08 <ulph> shapr: eller jag har kommit ur det rÃ¤ttare sagt ;)
16:50:15 <SyntaxNinja> I can see that it would be useful to have a collection of databases (implemented as files) as you suggest.
16:50:33 <SyntaxNinja> I really hate environment variables, but that's somewhat of a side issue
16:50:46 * lispy too
16:50:58 <FrederikEaton> that's a neurosis
16:51:14 <SyntaxNinja> I think ghc currently has the ability to read multiple files; I wonder what happens if you list multiple --package-conf on the command-line
16:51:20 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: no it's not.
16:52:18 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: the other problem is installing stuff. it's common for people to build binary packages by installing into an empty package root. then you install the binary package by copying, linking, whatever. but what do you do with the package.conf? you need a special tool to merge package.conf's
16:52:44 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: which wouldn't be necessary if the database were a regular directory
16:53:24 <shapr> ulph: Snart ska du titta pÃ¥ den harligt sprÃ¥k... den snygg funktionella skÃ¶nhet... sÃ¥ ren! sÃ¥ oskyldig!
16:53:24 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: well, I don't particularly care how the database is represented, that's a ghc-pkg issue, and ghc-pkg exists to abstract away the representation
16:53:33 <SyntaxNinja> so bring that up with the ghc guys
16:53:53 <SyntaxNinja> cabal will always use ghc-pkg because its a good abstraction.
16:54:01 <ulph> shapr: Joo, jag har skrivit en del i det ju, men det kÃ¤nns alltid lite bakvÃ¤nt :)
16:54:51 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: will do
16:55:30 <shapr> och det finns #haskell.se ocksÃ¥, om vi ska tala mycket mer svenska...
16:55:48 <shapr> Not that my swedish is really that great anyway, but it mostly works.
16:56:06 * Igloo sighs
16:56:25 <shapr> hi Igloo, what's up? Julius discussions making you sigh?
16:57:06 <Igloo> I assumed that a function that takes (const char *zSql, int nBytes /* Length of zSql in bytes. */) wanted a non-NUL terminated zSql. Instead it seems to want a NUL terminated string and completely ignores nBytes.
16:58:01 <Igloo> No, still loving SQLite tonight. I'll get around to Juliusz later.
16:58:56 <Igloo> Although my debugging more Haskell-C interfaces isn't helping his case much  :-)
16:59:42 <shapr> heh
17:05:58 <lispy> http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html
17:06:45 <lispy> Igloo: nbytes is perhaps where to start looking in the stirng?  but that is odd
17:07:18 <lispy> so, that blog talks about being lazy/dumb programmers
17:07:33 <Igloo> No, it completely ignores it
17:07:58 <shapr> lispy: That's sort of like the Perl merits, laziness, hubris, impatience, and something.
17:12:46 <shapr> hiya dave
17:13:25 <lispy> shapr: it does make some good arguments for certains types of "lazy" and "stupid"
17:13:34 <dave_m> hi, shapr
17:13:46 <lispy> lazy being basically, keep it simple and automated, build tools to replace repition
17:14:23 <lispy> stupid is essentially, make less assumptions, ask more questions even if they could sound dumb, asking basic stuff is good
17:14:54 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: heh, he redefines stupid in order to make that true ;)
17:15:05 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: yeah, same with lazy
17:15:17 <lispy> even so, i thought there was value in his overall message
17:15:36 <dave_m> maybe "naive" is closer than "stupid"
17:15:42 <shapr> Yeah, I like that.
17:15:55 <shapr> lispy: I think simplicity fits into his definition of lazy also.
17:16:12 <shapr> Make code easy to understand first, and make a separate convoluted fast version only if you must.
17:16:35 <shapr> That's one reason I'd move C code into Haskell. It's easier to make Haskell code correct than C code.
17:17:23 <lispy> shapr: if you're referring to Juliusz's comments, i think he has really goo dpoints
17:17:55 <lispy> i'd like to see all the code in haskell also, but none the less, he has a point....
17:18:58 <shapr> lispy: All of his points? or what?
17:19:30 <lispy> well, i think the points about getting help from the fs maintainers and it not being likely that they know C
17:19:50 <lispy> and that a lot of problems have been corrected in the C code, and how many new ones would we introduce in converting it to haskell
17:19:54 <shapr> Why would atomicity change between C and Haskell?
17:20:28 <rasfar> TheHunter, one final thank-you for that last link; worked like a charm!
17:21:02 <lispy> i agree with Juliusz that the question should be "How can we know that atomitcity will be the same between ghc haskell and C"
17:21:46 <lispy> for example, ghc stes O_NONBLOCK when it opens files
17:21:57 <lispy> are there other things it does?
17:23:37 <shapr> I betcha I can write QuickCheck tests to check atomicity with less effort than the equivalent C test code.
17:24:36 <lispy> shapr: if you could do that, it could help turn the argument in Igloo's favor
17:24:58 <lispy> and using quickcheck in darcs would probaably make it easier for me to write tests
17:25:10 <lispy> i balk at the thought of learning perl/sh for the task
17:26:43 <rasfar> oh oh what have i done....
17:26:54 <Igloo> If you want to help the issue at hand, find a reliable library with a maybe_relink equivalent in it
17:26:57 <lispy> rastabot: hi

17:28:14 <lambdabot> This MUST be a good party -- My RIB CAGE is being painfully pressed
17:28:14 <lambdabot> up
17:28:14 <lambdabot> against someone's MARTINI!!
17:28:14 <rastabot> Please come home with me ... I have Tylenol!!
17:29:13 <shapr> lambdabot's moo command was disabled.
17:29:21 <shapr> Some people think it's spam.
17:29:33 <Beelsebob> silly people
17:29:38 <rasfar> ah -- well it was funny for a while
17:31:37 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: I think you should care about the ghc package database representation, because ghc-pkg doesn't give us all the features we need, as I've pointed out.
17:31:52 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: I just added a page to the wiki
17:32:54 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: I wouldn't call that a FAQ by any stretch of the imagination
17:33:26 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: ?
17:34:01 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: have those questions ever been asked by someone besides you?
17:34:16 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: yes
17:34:18 <SyntaxNinja> I'm not saying that htey're invalid questions, just that they aren't frequently asked
17:34:36 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: what's your point, where are you going
17:34:54 <SyntaxNinja> I'm just saying its a bad name for the page
17:35:09 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: then rename it
17:35:29 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: i'm only doing this because you're too busy
17:35:52 <rasfar> @quit down for maintainance...
17:35:53 <lambdabot> not enough privileges
17:36:10 <SyntaxNinja> I'm sorry if that sounded unappreciative. I think it's useful to collect such issues
17:36:32 <SyntaxNinja> also, I think it's good to give feedback rather than just changing stuff
17:38:39 <SyntaxNinja> FrederikEaton: the reason I don't particularly care about ghc's pakge rep is because we use the ghc-pkg interface which allows cabal to be decoubled from the database representation
17:38:47 <SyntaxNinja> ...
17:39:29 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: well there should be a FAQ page. should we vote on how frequently each question is asked? each of those has at least 3 votes from people i respect. i think voting would be a waste of time. you can add your own questions if you think mine aren't representative.
17:39:46 <SyntaxNinja> you want to "register" a package by moving a file into place, as Iunderstand it, which means you'd be bypassing cabal altogether for this step.
17:41:03 <pesco> hello hello
17:42:00 <SyntaxNinja> hi pesco
17:42:16 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: well if the purpose of cabal is to give a compiler-agnostic way of installing source packages, but you leave people on their own when it comes to installing binary packages ... not really a full solution is it?
17:42:36 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: *somebody* has to worry about that
17:42:51 <SyntaxNinja> I don't understand what you're saying about binary packages.
17:42:58 <SyntaxNinja> what does that have to do w/ ghc-pkg's database?
17:43:41 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: i have to go, sorry
17:44:31 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: it's the problem that dcoutts is running into
17:45:28 <FrederikEaton> SyntaxNinja: IIRC
17:45:37 <SyntaxNinja> hm.
17:45:42 <SyntaxNinja> I don't think so.
17:45:53 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts actually is working w/ source packages
17:45:58 <pesco> Ooh, productive week. I have modules for vector graphics, metadata, and quick'n'dirty XML output waiting to be released.
17:46:27 <SyntaxNinja> cabal is meant to be able to install binary packages actually, there shouldn't be any problem with it, in theory
17:46:32 <SyntaxNinja> though ./setup bdist doesn't work, afaik
17:46:54 <SyntaxNinja> but all you have to do is tar up a built package, and "./setup install" should install the binary package
17:47:09 <SyntaxNinja> though I don't know of anyone who is interested in such binary packages.
17:58:56 <Igloo> I don't suppose anyone knows when Simon Marlow will be back at work?
18:02:29 <dons> I noticed a couple of commits from him last night
18:02:43 <shapr> Submarine coding
18:08:13 <reppie[^_^]> submarine coding?
18:09:04 <shapr> Yeah, go on vacation and commit code from a location where no one can contact you.
18:10:23 <dons> hehe

18:32:21 <dons> we made some more progress a couple of weeks ago, and I hope to get it in good condition before the end of next month
18:35:02 <marcot> dons: I couldn't use it even for small things because at the time I tryed it in only supported ascci.
18:36:25 <dons> it supports 8 bit chars, that's right.
18:36:46 <marcot> dons: does it support iso-8859-1 nowadays?
18:37:05 <dons> well, if you can fit the char in 8 bits, then yi can handle it
18:37:42 <dons> i know some people actually using it for small jobs - like darcs commits messages. so that's good.
18:38:04 <dons> needs more developers, or else patience
18:42:21 <marcot> dons: sure it do. I'm installing freebsd.
18:42:30 <marcot> After I start using, I'll try to use yi again.
18:43:25 <dons> it would be worth checking it build and runs nicely on FreeBSD
18:44:18 <marcot> ok..
18:58:25 <SyntaxNinja> dcoutts: did cabal-get work for you?
18:58:37 <SyntaxNinja> we desperately need alpha/beta testers!
18:58:43 <SyntaxNinja> is anyone willing to try out cabal-get?
18:59:27 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: after installing freebsd I promise to do tha.t
18:59:28 <marcot> =D
18:59:37 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: my debian system is no good for using cabal.
19:00:00 <SyntaxNinja> marcot: why?
19:00:07 <SyntaxNinja> it was developed on Debian, after all ;)
19:01:10 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: well, on sarge the ghc is too old. On sid it's broken.
19:01:10 <marcot> =D
19:01:28 <SyntaxNinja> sarge ghc isn't too old for cabal
19:02:18 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: sorry, cabal on sarge is too old.
19:02:31 <marcot> 0.5
19:02:53 <SyntaxNinja> ahh
19:03:04 <SyntaxNinja> well, you can get the sarge ghc and the current cabal tarball? :)
19:03:13 <SyntaxNinja> anyway, here's where cabal-get can be gotten: http://hackage.haskell.org/ModHackage/Hackage.hs?action=home
19:04:16 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: yes I could make this.
19:04:42 <marcot> SyntaxNinja: but as I'm moving to freebsd (if everything went fine), I'll do that in there.
19:09:48 <shapr> hej psi`, can only students rent studentbostader?
19:10:08 <shapr> oh well
19:11:24 <dons> SyntaxNinja, how do I get stuff hosted on hackage?
19:11:32 <shapr> hej psi`
19:11:39 <psi`> sorry shapr, I missed your message :-)
19:11:43 <shapr> psi`: Can only students rent studentbostader?
19:12:21 <psi`> hm. I would assume so, but I'm not sure. I'm not doing it myself.
19:12:52 <shapr> Ok, just curious. I'm trying to find something cheap and immediately available in either Boden or LuleÃ¥.
19:13:14 <SyntaxNinja> dons: you can use cabal-put
19:13:19 <shapr> Anyway, it's time for sleep, I have to work tomorrow.
19:13:31 <psi`> I *really* need to sleep as well :)
19:13:42 <SyntaxNinja> start w/ the cabal-get-bootstrap thingy, then "cabal-get install cabal-put" and then "cabal-put add mypackage"
19:13:48 <ptolomy> Say, what are a person's chances of writing haskell for a living?
19:13:52 <psi`> *wave*
19:14:06 <dons> SyntaxNinja, ok. I'll investigate
19:14:09 <Igloo> Hmm, "Failed 1/23 test scripts, 95.65% okay. -8/165 subtests failed, 104.85% okay."
19:14:44 <SyntaxNinja> dons: cool. please let me know how the process goes. this is all very beta :)
19:15:09 <ptolomy> Maybe I should rephrase; Anybody here get paid to write haskell?
19:16:03 * ptolomy recently got roped into a job writing a VB front-end for a huge ugly SQL engine, and writing in any functional language for a living seems like a gift from god, at this point.
19:16:32 <SyntaxNinja> my computer is broken, so I have to leave soon :(
19:43:36 <rasfar> ptolomy: I think I once heard dcoutts saying he did ... but I might be mistaken.
19:45:32 <rasfar> No it was shapr sorry.
20:28:20 <rasfar> Suppose I wanted Java code which was able to parse Haskell source modules and yield an abstract syntax tree: Anyone got advice on a good way to do this?  I'm looking at ANTLR, but unfortunatly there doesn't appear to be a Haskell grammar for ANTLR yet.
20:31:38 <kate`> you could rip the grammar out of ghc or hugs, surely?
20:31:47 <kate`> it'll be LALR, i imagine
20:32:28 <Cale> There will be some issues with fixity declarations
20:32:34 <Cale> I can imagine
20:32:49 <Cale> but those can probably be dealt with separately to some extent
20:33:14 <rasfar> yeah, I'd be willing to dispense with fixity altogether to start out.
20:33:35 <rasfar> kate': What do you mean, "rip it out"?
20:34:15 <Cale> I suppose to translate the grammar into some format suitable for a java parser generator.
20:34:16 <kate`> cut and paste
20:34:38 <TheHunter> iirc, ghc assumes some standard fixity for every operator and fixes the AST after parsing.
20:34:55 <kate`> if you have any sanity, you'll stick to LALR(k), but given the nature of your project, i assume that's out of the question :)
20:35:22 <rasfar> I have actually adapted the grammar from the Report (sans fixity)....
20:35:30 <kate`> on the other hand, you could write this in haskell...
20:35:42 <kate`> i assume there's some kind of java-haskell bridge?
20:35:52 <rasfar> Thanks for the comments.  I am really keen to do this, but quite a novice.
20:35:56 <Cale> It may also be possible to get ghc to spit out abstract syntax after all the desugaring and fixity fixing.
20:36:20 <kate`> hm
20:36:32 <rasfar> I have written some in Haskell, but I am concerned that the GUI side will be too slow.
20:36:37 <Cale> (in some reasonable format, though you might have to write some code to get it to do that)
20:36:49 <rasfar> Cale: That was one way I was hoping.
20:36:54 <Cale> rasfar: what are you writing?
20:37:45 <rasfar> Well, ahem, this is a bit of a secret still.  But it is a sort of graphical programming UI I have been toying with.  (I'm tired of leical paradigm!)
20:38:06 <rasfar> s/leical/lexical/
20:38:09 <Cale> there's wxHaskell, which I've found to be not so bad
20:38:55 <kate`> wxHaskell is related to wxWindows, the gui abstraction?
20:39:00 <Cale> yeah
20:39:00 <rasfar> Uh huh.  There's some synchronicity there, as a fellow was showing me his wxWindows book a week ago.  I presume wxHaskell is based on this?
20:39:11 <rasfar> (oops, you anticipatedme)
20:39:12 <Cale> wxWidgets now :)
20:39:13 <kate`> hm :)
20:39:33 <Cale> and gtk2hs
20:39:44 <rasfar> One probl;em is, I already wrote --- um let me count...
20:39:50 <Cale> though that seems lower level to me
20:40:19 <rasfar> 625,000 characters of Java on this project...
20:40:29 <Cale> ah
20:41:02 <rasfar> But that's okay.  I'm sure I learned a lot.  Or had a good time.  Well, I'm sure there's *something* positive about it!!
20:41:18 <Cale> you might find some way to bridge the gap
20:41:30 <rasfar> The Langages.Haskell.Syntax would be a nice thing to use.
20:41:57 <rasfar> Yes, that I may.
20:42:15 <rasfar> So what are you folks up to?
20:44:29 <Cale> not too much
20:44:59 * Korollary is whacking his head onto the desk
20:45:21 <rasfar> Korollary: Is this for fun, or as a pennance?
20:45:40 <Korollary> rasfar: I missed two interview questions today (out of time)...
20:46:16 <rasfar> Ah, time limits.  Very frustrating!  (I thought interviews were normally conversational?)
20:47:43 <Korollary> They are, even the phone interviews. In this phone interview she chose to email me some questions and give 30 mins
20:48:03 <rasfar> oooo...
20:48:27 <rasfar> Cale: We are both in Canada.  I'm in Calgary.  How about you?
20:48:49 <Cale> I'm in Brantford, Ontario
20:49:18 <rasfar> ah.  Havn't been.  Lived in Toronto for a few years when I was a youngster though.
20:49:28 <Cale> I was born in Toronto.
20:49:39 <Cale> I've been going to university in Waterloo.
20:49:43 <rasfar> How about the two active K's? (Kate and Korollary)
20:50:08 <rasfar> Oh.  Do most Waterloo students live in Brantford?
20:50:15 <Cale> no :)
20:50:15 <Korollary> Sunnyvale, California
20:50:28 <Cale> I'm home for a break
20:50:50 <rasfar> Ah.  Are you in grad. school?
20:51:13 <Cale> soon enough :)
20:51:20 <rasfar> cool
20:51:38 <rasfar> Same here.  (Not quite soon enough actually!)
20:51:47 <Korollary> Cale: did you get accepted ?
20:51:56 <Korollary> stupuid question
20:52:10 <Korollary> was it mcgill ?
20:52:33 <rasfar> McGill -- that's in Montreal isn't it?
20:52:50 <rasfar> Is there a university in Sunnyvale?
20:53:23 <Korollary> rasfar: Stanford is nearby
20:53:54 <rasfar> Really!  I never knew where Stanford was, thought it was eastern!
20:54:07 <rasfar> drofnats
20:54:16 <Cale> I only applied to a couple of places last time, and (actually probably a good thing, as I may still want to do a couple more courses here) wasn't accepted. I plan to do a larger run of applications soon, but I might see about doing some more research at McMaster first (or perhaps simply apply there as a grad student, I'm not sure)
20:54:25 <Cale> I'm basically done my undergrad though.
20:54:48 <rasfar> comp. sci. I presume?
20:55:01 <Cale> My undergrad was pure mathematics.
20:55:09 <Cale> I may do a masters in CS
20:55:22 <Cale> but I want to eventually return to pmath in any event.
20:55:35 <rasfar> Oh.  I have a math degree too, but I felt I needed to do a bachelors in cs to get where I'd like to be.
20:55:46 * Korollary exorcises math out of Cale and replaces it with greed and curly brace languages
20:55:57 <rasfar> a haha ha
20:56:00 <Cale> heh
20:57:10 <Cale> eventually I'd like to be a prof.
20:58:00 <Korollary> ok, this is going to be a tough one
20:58:54 <rasfar> Watching the posts on the haskell mailing list, it seems there's good opportunities in academics for FP people?
20:59:46 <Cale> seems that way :)
21:00:03 <Korollary> do you mean there is more funding for FP than other topics ?
21:01:00 <rasfar> I can't really say.  Maybe it's just one more manifestation of the ... what's the word ... welcomingness of Haskell community at large!
21:02:47 <Korollary> FP research in the US looked pretty bad to me
21:03:08 <rasfar> Oh.  Maybe you'
21:03:19 <rasfar> (oops) 'll want to look abroad!
21:03:28 <Korollary> heh
21:03:37 <Korollary> no, there are places. It's just not popular.
21:03:50 <Korollary> (surprise eh)
21:04:01 <rasfar> How could that be?  It seems like ms is into it!
21:04:13 <Korollary> MS UK, though
21:04:35 <rasfar> Oh -- I didn't know they were so distinct.
21:05:10 <Korollary> well, I wouldnt know what else ms research is doing in North america. But the Simon's are from MS Cambridge, iirc.
21:05:21 <rasfar> (Are we being annoying taking up bandwidth chatting like this?  I'm quite new to internet chat.)
21:06:00 <Korollary> Yes, please use concise sentences. Hah. Nah. These people are asleep anyway.
21:06:26 <SyntaxNinja> I'm not alseep. I'm annoyed that you'd say so
21:06:44 <SyntaxNinja> ;)
21:06:56 <rasfar> Hey!  I thought you quit?
21:07:04 <Korollary> I fell to the ninjitsu trick.
21:07:26 * rasfar giggle
21:08:23 <SyntaxNinja> I was gone, but I'm back!
21:08:35 <SyntaxNinja> my computer cooled off and I can use it again. I will surely depart bitterly within an hour
21:09:08 <rasfar> SyntaxNinja: Is it a hot climate?
21:09:25 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: IMO, it's usually pretty much fine to be off-topic unless it gets really crowded here and people are trying to talk about something on-topic and it's hard to follow the discussion
21:09:33 <SyntaxNinja> or if someone tells you to take it to another room or whatever
21:09:39 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: no, not at all. that's why gateway sucks
21:09:55 <rasfar> double-ah
21:09:57 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: my monitor has gone out on my 4 times, I think.  they keep repairing it (very quickly, mind you) and it keeps breaking.
21:10:54 <rasfar> Time for a breakthrough in affordable excellence in display technology
21:11:34 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: a fistthrough, you mean?
21:11:39 <SyntaxNinja> (ninja fist)
21:11:49 <Korollary> violence begats violence.
21:11:56 <rasfar> heh
21:12:06 <SyntaxNinja> Korollary: the internet is a dangerous place because I beat my computer.
21:13:07 <rasfar> I am thankful (mainly to slow vt220 vi sessions) to computers for eventually curing me of beating on things in frustration.
21:14:03 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: you're the one who suggested it
21:14:03 <Korollary> Our race is slowluy evolving out of physical manifestation of rage into calmly releasing worms and DDOS attacks
21:14:11 <SyntaxNinja> Korollary: heh
21:14:35 <rasfar> =)
21:14:47 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: oh, you should never use that smily face, it's considered rude.
21:15:06 <rasfar> =D then!
21:15:14 <Korollary> for our aussie friends, please use dual smilies, such as :) and (:
21:15:26 <SyntaxNinja> and our left-handed friends
21:15:36 <Korollary> or arabic
21:15:38 <Cale> =) is considered rude?
21:15:46 <SyntaxNinja> Cale: yeah, get with it
21:15:52 <Cale> since when?
21:15:56 <rasfar> Is it a moon?
21:15:58 * SyntaxNinja thinks it's pretty funny that so many programs come with a smiley-face button
21:16:03 * Korollary fears Cale won't make Prof
21:16:42 <Cale> Korollary: it's possible -- I'll find something interesting though :)
21:17:21 <SyntaxNinja> my irc client, my sms program, the evolution email composer, probably lots mroe
21:17:38 <Korollary> I bet it would be something mathematical. If you played with {}'s more often, you could synergize with the rest of the business world.
21:17:51 <Cale> Korollary: I've generally had trouble with the usual sort of sit-in exam. I do much better with assignments and take-home exams where the environment is calmer.
21:18:04 <SyntaxNinja> but I note that NONE of them have a button for the incredibly rude =) emoticon
21:18:08 <Cale> Which hurts my marks quite a bit.
21:18:48 <Cale> Korollary: I can code, but I'd rather not spend a sizable portion of my life writing code in an imperative language.
21:18:49 <Korollary> Cale: I do fine at sit-in exams. I believe the 30 min limit was set purposely short to drive the taker into stress.
21:19:32 <Cale> Here they're 2-3 hours, but fairly long to make that usually not quite enough time.
21:20:03 <Korollary> Cale: It's 2-3 hours here, too. This was a phone screen for a job.
21:20:08 <Cale> ah
21:22:02 <SyntaxNinja> how does one center figures in latex?
21:23:03 <Cale> \begin{center} ... \end{center} ?
21:23:14 <SyntaxNinja> no, that seems to have no effect
21:23:16 * rt_ tries once again to figure out why people think parser combinators are a good thing.
21:23:17 <Cale> hmm
21:23:32 <SyntaxNinja> when I wrap it all around the \begin{figure} ... thng
21:23:47 <SyntaxNinja> rt_: don't like parsec?
21:24:09 <rt_> it seems fairly cryptic compared to something like happy.
21:24:12 <Cale> http://www.iam.ubc.ca/~newbury/tex/figures.html#centering
21:24:19 <SyntaxNinja> latex always makes me have the thought, "I see why everyone wants to re-implement latex"
21:24:29 <metaperl> SyntaxNinja: still on IRC? wow
21:24:31 <lispy_> rt_: each to his/her own, i feel the opposite :)
21:24:32 <metaperl> I like LaTeX
21:24:48 <rt_> it seems to require more work to factor grammars to make code which actually runs.
21:24:53 <metaperl> its great for taking reams of text and making it look typeset very quickly
21:25:01 <lispy_> SyntaxNinja: yeah, although, for the most part the syntax is fine.  It's the semantics of things like figures that bug me
21:25:18 <Cale> I think people should definitely use TeX as a backend though, if they're going to do so.
21:25:25 * rt_ thinks that plain TeX is generally superior to LaTeX.
21:25:58 <metaperl> no, I need bibtex, makeindex and all the other LaTeX goodies
21:25:59 <Korollary> lispy_: How about a new project where you write haskell code that targets TeX ?
21:26:09 <SyntaxNinja> metaperl: back, sorta.
21:26:12 <SyntaxNinja> I was at work, now I'm home.
21:26:21 <SyntaxNinja> but I don't live on IRC, I swear.  I get out and risk my life very often.
21:26:22 <Korollary> viva VPN
21:26:29 <SyntaxNinja> ie, tuesdays, thursdays, and twice on weekends
21:26:39 <rasfar> \me likes plain TeX but got too carried away with microscopic adjustments...
21:27:08 <Korollary> IRC is a risky place, too, with the rude smileys and all. It could get ugly.
21:27:23 <SyntaxNinja> sadly, the \leavevmode magic doesn't work for me.
21:27:26 <rasfar> SystaxNinja: Did you try \begin{center}...  AFTER \begin{figure}... ?
21:27:27 <SyntaxNinja> thanks for the link, though cal
21:27:43 <SyntaxNinja> rasfar: yeah
21:28:30 <Cale> does the \centerline{\hbox{...}} trick work?
21:31:12 <rasfar> You can also try a "minipage".
21:31:51 <SyntaxNinja> hm. nope, it's a text area, and it complains that the paragraph ends before the hbbox is complete
21:31:57 <SyntaxNinja> centerline, I mean
21:32:03 <Cale> \begin{figure}[htbp]
21:32:03 <Cale> \centering
21:32:03 <Cale> \epsfig{file=example.eps, width=\textwidth}
21:32:03 <Cale> \caption{ Caption text. }
21:32:03 <Cale> \label{fig:example}
21:32:04 <Cale> \end{figure}
21:32:11 <Cale> is an example from somewhere else
21:32:42 <SyntaxNinja> hm. nope
21:35:31 <SyntaxNinja> wow, \begin{center} does have some effect, though... it causes the figure to not come after the bibliography, which I kinda like
21:35:53 <Cale> huh
21:35:56 <Cale> odd :)
21:36:23 * SyntaxNinja grimaces not THAT smiley face
21:36:55 <rasfar> hypersensitivity to emoticons
21:38:13 * SyntaxNinja is just trying to confuse cale
21:39:36 <Cale> heh
21:40:30 <SyntaxNinja> isn't it counter-intuitive that you're supposed to click on the smiley face button in order to insert a frowny-face? :(
21:40:41 <SyntaxNinja> it's kinda like "Start -> Shutdown"
21:41:16 <Korollary> hmm
21:41:29 <Korollary> that's not innovative. how did they let that one go...
21:43:16 <SyntaxNinja> yeah
21:44:05 <Korollary> It was in their questionnaire that they sent me... What was it exactly...
21:44:26 <SyntaxNinja> I hate to say this, but it puts my email address on the first page, alone, and then the next page is the title page
21:45:06 <Korollary> "What have you done that was innovative?". That one made me chuckle.
21:45:45 <SyntaxNinja> "they"?
21:45:51 <Korollary> M$'
21:46:02 <SyntaxNinja> ahh
21:46:09 <SyntaxNinja> "Where do you want to go today"
21:46:13 <Korollary> exactly
21:46:13 <SyntaxNinja> that would make a good question
21:46:29 <Korollary> They had great questions, too
21:46:49 <Korollary> "How do you teach yourself a new computer language? "
21:47:24 <humasect> is sequence_/mapM_ the most common way to expand a repeated action into one?
21:47:32 <humasect> heh
21:47:47 <Korollary> "expand into one" ?
21:48:25 <SyntaxNinja> humasect: mapM sounds good to me
21:48:34 <humasect> ok thanks
21:49:00 <kate`> how *do* you teach yourself a new language?
21:49:26 <kate`> i realised recently that it's been quite a while since i set out to learn a new language, and i've no idea how i acquired the knowledge i currently have
21:49:34 <SyntaxNinja> kate`: I think the best way is to read a tutorial and then try to implement something that's fun, small, and useful
21:49:44 <kate`> that's what i concluded
21:49:52 <SyntaxNinja> I usually have a pretty long list of small, useful programs that need to get written
21:49:52 <Korollary> That's the secret. If you learn how to do it, you cannot do it anymore !!!
21:50:16 <kate`> i've tried several unsuccessful times to acquire the ability to code haskell, with little headway; i *think* because i'm only trying random dissociated examples
21:50:26 <kate`> as opposed to trying to produce a coherent program
21:50:36 <Korollary> do the examples work ?
21:50:42 <SyntaxNinja> kate`: yeah, use Yet Another Haskell Tutorial, and when you finish that off, go work on a little program
21:51:15 <kate`> part of my problem is that all the little programs i need are already written :)
21:51:41 <kate`> and whilst i'd be happy to re-invent cat(1) several years ago, now i just dont have motivation to spend on that sort of thing
21:51:48 <kate`> so i'm not sure what to do about that
21:52:00 <Korollary> I have a hard time finding sizable projects to do as well. Fortunately, I am obsessed with a toy benchmark.
21:52:25 <Korollary> I wrote it in c++, haskell and ocaml
21:52:26 <humasect> games =)
21:52:40 <humasect> writing a little game could be fun and interesting.
21:53:12 <kate`> humasect; it would be highly suited to searching red/black trees, for example
21:53:17 <Korollary> Next up, I am going to write a few ocaml or haskell scripts to automate my CD ripping and conversion process.
21:53:30 <mikael> maybe you could start using Haskell for a non-trivial program -- there are always easy parts, and the hard parts are always surmountable
21:53:39 <kate`> hm
21:53:46 <humasect> desu
21:55:31 <kate`> i shall see how it goes for some sql->xml things
21:56:48 <kate`> i was trying to get at a deeper problem, though
21:56:55 * humasect fights with wash
21:57:23 <rasfar> Deeper than sql->xml?!?  What could be deeper?
21:57:34 <kate`> it's like i became pragmatic without noticing. that's a really horrible thought
21:57:40 <rasfar> (I'm not sure if I'm being facetious.)
21:58:06 <kate`> rasfar; i meant the problem of why i'm not learning new languages any more
21:58:26 <rasfar> I wouldn't know (yet), but sounds like what happens once you start getting paid to do it instead of doing it out of curiosity.
21:58:37 <rasfar> (I'd *like* to get paid, don't get me wrong.)
21:58:48 <kate`> well, i'm not getting paid, though i should be...
21:58:54 <rasfar> hmph
21:59:35 <rasfar> I wish I could help motivate you but I'm acually experiencing some of the same feelings.
21:59:59 <kate`> oh, it's not motivation i'm looking for: i can do that myself. it's understanding that i need
22:00:04 <rasfar> I have reams of notes with ideas, but I don't have the heart to get back into that at the moment.
22:00:16 <kate`> likewise
22:00:30 <lispy_> cool, i just won,  Â£774,505
22:00:41 <Cale> er, in real money?
22:00:44 <lispy_> they sent me an email!
22:00:47 <rasfar> Well, there's a lot of great tutorials etc.  -- but for me, unless I'm trying to *do* something, specific, I have motivation issues.
22:00:50 <lispy_> said i won the lottery, it must be real
22:01:23 <Korollary> rasfar: you can start hacking on existing haskell apps like darcs
22:01:24 <Cale> lispy_: awesome, you're rich! Where do you pick it up? Some nice abandoned warehouse?
22:01:34 <humasect> uh oh. GHC tells me of an abiguous reference, but then tells me one is out of scope.
22:02:06 <kate`> rasfar; right, exactly my point
22:02:07 <rasfar> Korollary: Yes.  I think I'm getting there.  Just being on this irc channel again is a positive step...  I build a lambdabot today too.
22:02:15 <lispy_> Cale: hehe, yes!  all i have to do is participate in their scam
22:02:40 <Korollary> lispy_: Permit me to inform you of my desire to go into business with you.
22:02:40 <rasfar> kate': Well, maybe we should agree on something important and collaborate?
22:03:16 <rasfar> Is there a "Haskell community wish list" out there, of high-priority coding needs?
22:03:27 <kate`> rasfar; you really don't want to collaborate with me :)
22:03:37 <Korollary> rasfar: there's a library project on sourceforge
22:03:44 <kate`> not to mention that part of the problem is that i dont actually have time
22:03:44 <rasfar> kate': you may be right! :-P
22:04:44 <Korollary> you could start writing small things like trim() for haskell strings, etc.
22:05:21 <rasfar> Korollary: This is good advice.  Can you toss us a link to this sourceforge project?
22:06:00 <rasfar> (Not like I having any shortage of bookmarks, but ....)
22:06:02 <Korollary> http://sourceforge.net/projects/haskell-libs
22:07:11 <rasfar> awesome thanx
22:26:41 * ptolomy really loves Parsec.
22:27:02 <rasfar> Korollary: I'm not certain how to query, but from what I can tell that prokect is not been touched for over a year?!...
22:27:12 <Korollary> that is correct
22:27:26 <rasfar> okay, just checking.
22:27:43 <rasfar> ptolomy: What are you using The Parsec for may I enquire?
22:29:42 <rasfar> (too busy doing it to talk about it I guess)
22:32:36 <Cale> rasfar: I've used parsec to parse all sorts of things -- probably the largest language I used it to parse was a slight abstraction of powerpc + altivec assembly, in which one would express dependencies between values, and could specify more than one way to compute a particular value (a scheduler would decide which way was faster)
22:33:18 <Cale> rasfar: also, I wrote a small parser for musical chord names for a little app I wrote for my dad
22:34:02 <Cale> It's really nice to be able to treat parsers as values, and construct them from other data.
22:35:13 <Cale> the "assembly" language I parsed for example, was completely abstracted over the instruction set -- a data structure gets passed in which describes the various instructions, and a parser is constructed from that.
22:35:13 <rasfar> cool.  I was starting to look at parsec -- in fact it's the first thing I looked at -- when I decided using a third-party parser generator would be wise.  I forget why I moved away from it ... probably the Java angle.
22:36:30 <Cale> (the same data structure is used by the scheduler to determine how to schedule the instructions, as it has the timing information in it as well)
22:39:01 <rasfar> The only thing I don't like about parsec so far is, on the official web page, whenever I move my mouse I get a little window announcing "parsec, a fast combinator parser".
22:39:45 <rasfar> Cale: Is the scheduler also in Haskell?
22:39:55 <Cale> rasfar: yes :)
22:40:31 <Cale> It was a really nice example of how to use monads (the list monad in particular) and laziness to good effect.
22:41:28 <rasfar> Too special purpose to add it to haskell-libs?  It might be good to see...
22:41:47 <Cale> It's part of the Coconut project at McMaster university.
22:41:57 <rasfar> Oh!
22:42:37 <Cale> have you heard of it?
22:42:57 <rasfar> er, no i don't think so
22:43:21 <Cale> I thought that might have been an "Oh!" of recognition there :)
22:43:37 <Cale> http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/ has some information on it
22:43:44 <Cale> (scroll down)
22:43:59 <rasfar> no i'm just ebullient[?]
22:44:25 <rasfar> Yes I had his page up a moment ago, and then my twm got glitchy on me and the icon vanished!
22:45:45 <newsham> hi.  I want to get HGL, I have hugs for windows and I cant get find the HGL installer
22:45:55 <newsham> (there's a broken link on the web page)  any ideas?
22:46:26 <Cale> well, HGL comes with GHC
22:46:53 <Cale> so you could try that if you don't mind using GHC rather than hugs.
22:47:22 <Cale> http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/downloads/SOE.msi ?
22:47:22 <newsham> isnt HGL "Hugs Graphics Library"?
22:47:31 <newsham> cale: bad url (404)
22:47:35 <Cale> oh
22:47:37 <Cale> hmm...
22:47:59 <newsham> I wanted it mostly to look at http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~cxl/haskell-in-space/
22:48:09 <Cale> I would have assumed it's just "Haskell Graphics Library"
22:48:10 <newsham> as a learning tool (I'm new to haskell)
22:49:00 <Cale> oh, yeah, on that page it does say Hugs Graphics Library
22:49:16 <newsham> but it may be wrong. heh.
22:49:26 <newsham> it implies that it runs (2.0.4 at least) in both hugs and ghc
22:49:40 <newsham> so probably I want to dig up a 2.0.4 version
22:49:50 <Cale> http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/downloads/Nov2002/SOE.msi
22:50:09 <Cale> does that work?
22:50:41 <newsham> trying it out
22:50:48 <newsham> what does SOE stand for, btw?
22:50:55 <Cale> School of Expression
22:51:01 <Cale> iirc
22:51:08 <Cale> The book that the library was written for
22:51:08 <newsham> yah, thats what it says in Program Files now
22:51:30 <newsham> well it seems to have installed.. how would I know if its hooked into hugs properly? :)
22:52:31 <Cale> hmm... perhaps there are some demos that install with it?
22:54:48 <Cale> sorry I'm not terribly familiar with it -- I'll download the package for linux/hugs which is hopefully compatible and have a look through it
22:55:07 <newsham> I found a README, I can probalby stumble through this
22:56:06 <Cale> yeah, the linux package comes with a bunch of demos
22:56:31 <newsham> README says to do something like :set -Pc:\Hugs98\win32;c:\Hugs98\graphics-2.0.4\lib\win32;
23:15:19 <newsham> hmm.. install seems to be ok, but perhaps some versioning issues?
23:15:24 <newsham> ERROR "c:\progra~1\soe\graphics\lib\win32\GraphicsTypes.hs" - Unknown entity "fromInt" impor
23:15:25 <newsham> ted from module "Int"
23:15:40 <newsham> when I try to :load the helloworld.hs demo
23:16:18 <Cale> ah
23:16:25 <Cale> change fromInt to fromIntegral
23:16:30 <Cale> fromInt is gone
23:18:19 <Cale> hmm... module Int...
23:18:24 <Cale> oh
23:20:23 <Cale> hrm
23:20:40 <Cale> yeah, try changing fromInt to fromIntegral and getting rid of the "import Int"
23:22:35 <Cale> (the language and libraries have changed a bit since then)
23:28:06 <newsham> looks like its all over the place
23:28:20 <newsham> (in the graphics library)
23:29:23 <newsham> soe from nov2002, win hugs from nov2003
23:30:47 <newsham> i'll install an older winhugs
23:30:51 <newsham> probably easiest for now
23:37:06 <newsham> cool, that worked.
23:40:44 <newsham> great, the asteroids program is working.
23:41:06 <newsham> questin: do people do gui programming in haskell, and if so, what sort of gui packages are available or hookable?

23:48:32 <Cale> newsham: wxHaskell seems popular
23:48:37 <Cale> there's also gtk2hs
23:55:50 <boegel> newsham: you should read my TMR article, that'll get you hooked on gtk2hs
