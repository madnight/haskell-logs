00:22:25 <autrijus> hm, hPutPS assumes latin1.
00:22:29 <autrijus> this is so blatantly wrong :-/
00:22:35 * autrijus ponders how to fix that.
00:23:12 <paolo> @index hPutPS
00:23:13 <lambdabot> Data.PackedString
00:23:29 <paolo> WroomStrings
00:23:42 <autrijus> what's what?
00:23:44 <autrijus> Wroom?
00:23:52 <paolo> As in: fast :-P
00:23:57 <autrijus> I see
00:24:07 <Korollary> I see a Data.Autrijus.PackedString.hPutPS in the making :)
00:24:14 <paolo> I don't know how could you fix it, tough.
00:24:45 <autrijus> Korollary: or just hPutPSutf8
00:25:30 <autrijus> hm it's implemented with hPutArray
00:25:47 <autrijus> @index hPutArray
00:25:48 <lambdabot> Data.Array.IO
00:25:56 <Heffalump> morning
00:26:03 <autrijus> ah so it's fixed to word8
00:26:04 <autrijus> that explains
00:26:26 <autrijus> so I just need to put encodeUTF8 there.
00:26:30 <autrijus> good enough
00:36:44 * boegel wonders if shapr has managed to get FLM online yet
00:40:08 * boegel wonders off again
00:42:02 * autrijus purrs
00:42:07 <Heffalump> what library does encodeUTF8 come from?
00:43:54 <paolo> @index encodeUTF8
00:43:55 <lambdabot> bzzt
00:44:10 <paolo> ..from the bzzt-wormhole it seems :-P
00:44:48 <dblhelix> yeah I always wondered where to find that magic bzzt lib
00:46:45 <tuomov> joelk, Lemmih: the adaptive statusbar, scratchpad (Mod1+space by default, although I'd prefer Mod1+section(fi kbs, left of 1), floating splits, auto-show-completions, perhaps easier configuration files, etc.
00:47:54 <Lemmih> tuomov: Why doesn't window caption work for SDL apps in ion?
00:48:07 <tuomov> it doesn't?
00:48:19 <joelk> not here.
00:49:28 <tuomov> maybe it does something stupidly wrt. using WM_NAME and _NET_WM_NAME
00:50:11 <tuomov> what sdl apps there are that I might have on an almost out-of-the-box fedora system?
00:51:45 <tuomov> (I didn't install it!)
00:51:52 <tuomov> (or choose it)
00:52:27 <tuomov> grep finds tvtime and its title works just fine
00:53:07 <tuomov> WM_NAME is properly a plain string, and _NET_WM_NAME utf-8
01:00:31 <Itkovian> meuning
01:00:53 <paolo> hiya Igloo
01:01:05 <paolo> yeah, and Itkovian :-)
01:04:44 <Heffalump> you think Igloo would be up at this time? :-)
01:05:21 <paolo> The b0rken tab completition think so, would you mess with it?
01:05:39 <Heffalump> it's obviously never met Igloo.
01:06:35 * Lemmih picks up his butchers knife and attacks HSPR.
01:14:41 * autrijus wonders how close 6.4.1 is
01:15:26 <wilx> Hm, a friend who has never had any experience with functional programming wants to learn Haskell.
01:15:37 <wilx> What tutorial should I recommend him?
01:16:22 <Lemmih> http://haskell.org/complex/introduction_to_programming.html, perhaps.
01:18:55 <Itkovian> Lemmih: that's a nice tutorial
01:20:15 * boegel kicks Itkovian
01:20:45 <Itkovian> yeah well ...
01:24:26 <boegel> Itkovian: did you see the comment on your hs blog post ?
01:25:30 <Itkovian> eh? no, I don't think so.
01:28:57 <boegel> hah, die amerikanen toch :)
01:30:45 <Itkovian> reading the article
01:31:07 <boegel> leaving the room and continueing to read the few articles I have left to read
01:31:10 <paolo> Itkovian, what blog?
01:31:17 <boegel> paolo: hs
01:31:33 <paolo> Haskell Sequence?
01:32:03 <boegel> paolo: yes, Itkovian posted something on researching Haskell's cache behaviour and suc, and someone replyed with an article
01:32:06 <boegel> bye now :p
01:47:02 <musasabi> morning
01:47:10 <lispy_> @pl get zdepth >>= (\x -> writeIORef zdepth (x-0.1))
01:47:11 <lambdabot> writeIORef zdepth . subtract (0 . 1) =<< get zdepth
01:47:32 <lispy_> (0 . 1) ?
01:48:34 <lispy_> @pl get zdepth >>= (\x -> writeIORef zdepth (x - 1))
01:48:35 <lambdabot> writeIORef zdepth . subtract 1 =<< get zdepth
01:48:57 <paolo> Pretty :-)
01:55:08 <lispy_> i like it a lot better than what I had before
01:56:15 <lispy_> which was do { zd <- get  zdepth; writeIORef zdepth (zd - 0.1); return ()}
02:05:12 <Itkovian> nice article and definitely in the line of what I'd like to do
02:12:08 <pejo> Itkovian, was it me who replied?
02:12:17 <Itkovian> erm
02:12:39 <Itkovian> looking at your nick, it may very well be ... Peter?
02:12:47 <Itkovian> yes
02:14:34 <pejo> Itkovian, ah, ok. I have those scripts for measuring laying around but haven't had time to look at them yet.
02:14:49 <Itkovian> and the altered valgrind too?
02:15:47 <pejo> Itkovian, that article was written before Cachegrind was a part of Valgrind.
02:15:57 <Itkovian> ah ok.
02:16:09 <Itkovian> Never used valgrind, we have our inhouse tool (DIOTA)
02:16:25 <pejo> Itkovian, valgrind --tool=cachegrind anna <input> should work.
02:16:37 <Itkovian> heh, cool\
02:17:39 <paolo> "I" ++ "DIOTA" means dumb in italian
02:18:02 <pejo> Itkovian, ah. If you're interested in dynamic binary analysis I'd recommend Nethercoetes thesis.
02:18:22 <pejo> Itkovian, gives a pretty good description of Valgrind internals and related work.
02:18:23 <Itkovian> paolo: I know
02:18:36 <Itkovian> but a diota is a two handles cup in greek
02:18:55 <paolo> The one with two faces on the sides? heh.
02:19:06 <Itkovian> no just with two handles afaik
02:20:36 <Itkovian> pejo: have you got an url?
02:21:04 <pejo> Itk, http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~njn/pubs/phd2004.pdf

02:36:06 <lambdabot> and 19 seconds since then.
02:36:06 * boegel Itkovian 3 maanden abbo ? why-o-why ?
02:36:24 <boegel> Itkovian: probably hacking FLM again :)
02:36:44 <paolo> Itkovian, nope, ubuntu breezy: X is being repackaged and it leaks some things... Emacs didn't appreciate.
02:36:54 <Itkovian> use vim ;-)

02:51:56 * boegel Itkovian ik zie het wel dus... kan nog leuk worden als ze het niet aanvaarden, dan moet ik het verschil gaan betalen bij de NMBS, en krijg dat daar maar ne keer uitgelegd :s
02:52:07 <boegel> omg, what the hell am I doing
02:52:20 <Itkovian> boegel: you should make a disticntion between the private conversation on the channel, eh ;-)
02:52:31 <boegel> yeah, I'm fucking this up big time
02:53:12 <boegel> the thing is, I'm working on a text-based client (irc in bash), so a mistake is easily made
03:01:21 <Itkovian> boegel: what client?
03:01:30 <Itkovian> in BitchX you can have multiple tabs

04:27:57 <lambdabot> I saw void- leaving #haskell 8 days, 21 hours, 26 minutes and 18
04:27:57 <lambdabot> seconds ago, and I have missed 2 days, 23 hours, 12 minutes and 20
04:27:57 <lambdabot> seconds since then.
04:28:08 <dblhelix> @seen Lemmih
04:28:09 <lambdabot> Lemmih is in #haskell. Last spoke 18 minutes and 34 seconds ago.
04:28:15 <dblhelix> ah
04:28:22 <dblhelix> Lemmih: ping
04:28:28 <Lemmih> pong.
04:29:13 <Lemmih> What's up?
04:29:22 <dblhelix> Lemmih: using your SDL binding, what do you recommend for making SDL_main available?
04:29:40 <Lemmih> SDL_main?
04:30:17 <dblhelix> yeah, the one to be called from SDL's main function
04:30:49 <dblhelix> the implementation behind SDL.h is supposed to rename a user defined main to SDL_main, isn't it?
04:31:12 <Lemmih> On what platform? OSX?
04:31:18 <dblhelix> yes
04:32:12 <Lemmih> Can you spare a shell account?
04:32:37 <dblhelix> I finally got it working on OSX last night, but I still use a C wrapper to call Haskell's main
04:32:50 <Lemmih> I would love to port my binding to OSX but I'm without access to such machines.
04:33:11 <dblhelix> at home I can, but at work I'm afraid I can't
04:33:59 <Lemmih> You can probably just link with the Haskell RTS after libSDL.
04:34:07 <dblhelix> it's not that hard actually to compile your code on OSX, but one has to battle hsc2hs first
04:34:08 <Lemmih> (that's what I did with ClanLib)
04:35:29 <dblhelix> how do you do it with SDL on other platforms?
04:37:32 <Lemmih> It's not an issue on other platforms.
04:37:47 <dblhelix> ah, okay :)
04:38:16 <Lemmih> SDL doesn't have it's own main function on i386 linux at least.
04:38:28 <Lemmih> s/it's/its/
04:38:57 <dblhelix> on mac os it needs to initialise the Cocoa stuff etc., that's why
04:40:26 <Lemmih> Oh, then it wont work to link with the RTS after libSDL /-:
04:41:20 <Lemmih> A C wrapper around the haskell main might be the correct thing after all.
04:42:08 <dblhelix> it's not that bad anyway, but it would be nice to just need *.hs
04:42:18 * paolo screams
04:47:21 <Wed19142> hmm the wildcard in Makefiles probably doesnt expand over subdirs right?
04:47:53 <wilx> Hmm, what is the state of GHC on Gentoo? A friend of mine complains that its compilation/emerge doesn't dies somewhere.
04:50:09 <musasabi> wilx: it should work fine, but vanilla GHC will not work.
04:50:34 <musasabi> wilx: as gcc needs to be passed extra arguments on gentoo as it has custom patches breaking things.
04:51:07 <wilx> Ok.
04:53:32 <musasabi> Personally I think gentoo is not very nice shipping an incompatible version of GCC by default.
04:54:31 <wilx> Heh, incompatible with what?
04:54:39 <wilx> What version does it use?
04:54:47 <musasabi> things like ghc, qemu and so on.
04:54:58 <musasabi> wilx: they use patches not in the GHC mainline.
04:55:05 <musasabi> *GCC
04:55:12 <wilx> Hm.
04:55:22 <musasabi> stack protector and other stuff
04:55:42 <wilx> I see.
04:56:21 <wilx> Is it possible to do pattern matching on records?
04:56:39 <Wed19142> normally...it is
04:56:40 <wilx> foo (REC {a, b}) = ...?
04:56:57 <Wed19142> foo (REC a b) = ...
04:57:56 <wilx> Cool.
04:58:44 <Wed19142> wooooow sick ass deja vu
04:58:58 <wilx> And what does Eq (STRef s a)
04:59:01 <wilx> ...compare.
04:59:02 <wilx> ?
04:59:27 <Wed19142> no idea
05:01:23 <kosmikus> I think that  foo (REC { label = pat })  works, too
05:05:00 <wilx> @hoogle Eq (STRef s a)
05:05:03 <lambdabot> Prelude.undefined :: a
05:05:03 <lambdabot> Prelude.minBound :: Bounded a => a
05:05:03 <lambdabot> Prelude.maxBound :: Bounded a => a
05:05:09 <wilx> Hmpf.
05:08:16 <wilx> @hoogle sameMutVar
05:09:01 <wilx> Looks like it is pointer equality, good.
05:35:00 <wilx> @hoogle assert

05:35:52 <shapr> hoi Itkovian, how's code?
05:36:01 <Itkovian> baD BAD bad
05:36:04 <Itkovian> :-)
05:36:07 <Beelsebob> that bad
05:36:08 <shapr> really? how so?
05:36:09 <Beelsebob> oh dear
05:36:10 <Itkovian> yeah
05:36:26 <Itkovian> well, we need to do stuff but somehow it's still not feasible.
05:36:28 <Itkovian> grmbl.
05:36:37 <Itkovian> we need a deonstrator by september
05:37:01 <shapr> deonstrator?
05:37:06 <shapr> That's a neat word.
05:38:04 <shapr> I made up some words recently, two I liked were matzapatchou and shazamanizad.
05:40:39 <shapr> sylvan: Hey, can you explicitly license your Bencode parser in Parsec?
05:41:20 <sylvan> what?
05:41:34 <aleator> shapr: leptokurtotic. And it is a real word.
05:41:36 <shapr> sylvan: I'd prefer BSD if you're not picky. I'm using your Bencode parser in a bittorrent client implementation. So far I've only added QuickCheck tests and torrent checking.
05:41:50 <shapr> lepto is butterfly... kurtotic I don't know.
05:41:56 <sylvan> Do what you want with it =)
05:42:11 <shapr> sylvan: Yeah, but an explicit BSD license would make my life easier :-)
05:42:20 <sylvan> sure, it's BSD licensed! =)
05:42:25 <shapr> Ok, fair enough.
05:43:34 * shapr throws in a license and copyright statement for both Sebastian Sylvan and Shae Erisson
05:43:44 <aleator> shapr: it means either sub- or supergaussian distribution. Can't remember which..
05:43:49 <shapr> Oh, nifty!
05:43:59 * aleator spreads knowledge
05:44:02 <shapr> I think lepto means winged.
05:44:15 <shapr> So I suspect it makes a two or four lobed shape.
05:44:21 <aleator> Oh.. That actually makes sense..
05:44:35 <aleator> so it is a supergaussian..
05:44:38 <Itkovian> lepto-. prefix. Definitions:. thin, slender leptosome
05:44:48 <shapr> ooh, thanks
05:45:52 <paolo> I can't code without my font - grumble
05:47:25 <aleator> But, since this is haskell, I'm still having s slight ffi modelling problem: "void doThing(bigMatrix *src, bigMatrix *src2, bigMatrix *dst)", where commonly on would like to reuse src matrix as dst also..
05:48:23 <aleator> Or, in more simple case "void doSomething(bigMatrix *src,bigMatrix *dst)"..
05:48:44 <aleator> So In most cases you would use a same matrix as src and dst to save space.
05:49:23 <aleator> Thus far I've haskellized it so that i can sequence the operations. And then run the operation (purely even) by copying the input once and feeding it to the sequence.
05:50:10 <aleator> As runStuff matrix (op1 `after` op2 `after` op3)
05:51:14 <aleator> How do I handle such sequencing cleanly when some operator takes more than one parameter?
05:52:00 * aleator thinks his skill of explaining things is underdeveloped..
05:54:18 <aleator> It could almost be a monad, but I can't make sure that modified values are not used later on..
05:54:39 <paolo> What do you exactly need to do?
05:55:16 <shapr> greetz poetix
05:58:56 <basti_> hi
05:59:08 <paolo> hello basti_
05:59:31 * poetix looks up blearily
05:59:59 <basti_> whats wrong poetix ?
06:00:10 <poetix> Lack of sleep mainly
06:00:23 <aleator> paolo: Ok. example: I have image filters erode, dilate and a "filter" that takes pixelwise mininum of the image. I would like, from those to derive elegant and efficient opening by reconstruction.
06:01:03 <basti_> :/
06:01:27 <basti_> aleator: "opening by reconstruction"??
06:01:36 <paolo> aleator, <Interrupted by basti_>
06:02:20 <poetix> shapr: I was just suggesting to a friend of mine that he should come and talk to you about wikis and pdfs (and word docs, and other heathen formats)
06:02:53 <poetix> He wants to hack together a wiki-alike document sharing system, and FLM came rather immediately to mind.
06:02:55 <aleator> basti_: you dilate marker image, limiting it below original image until it converges. (The marker image is obtained from repeated erosions of original image)
06:03:38 <aleator> I'm not making any sense, am I?
06:03:45 <basti_> i dont understand what the aim is
06:03:49 <basti_> what are you trying to do?
06:03:49 <paolo> aleator, maybe you should introduce the argument
06:04:51 <shapr> poetix: Does he have some other unusual ideas for such a system?
06:05:21 <poetix> shapr: He wants to do plaintext extraction from various document types
06:05:37 <basti_> you mean, OCR?
06:05:40 <poetix> Preferably converting them to decent HTML
06:05:48 <basti_> ah
06:05:49 <basti_> that other guy
06:05:54 <shapr> I liked the SVG suggestion.
06:05:59 <shapr> That would be much better.
06:06:00 <basti_> aleator: what are you trying to do?
06:06:20 <paolo> SVG!
06:06:27 <poetix> In the case of scanned .tifs, maybe. In the case of Word docs, it's more a question of getting inside the binary format and getting the textual goodness out
06:06:32 <aleator> Simplified: I'm trying to do image processing using haskell and openCV.
06:07:23 <basti_> hmmm
06:07:32 <poetix> Given that SVG-inna-browser is still rather more on-the-way than actually arrived, I guess you need some other more widely-supported format to degrade to
06:07:36 <poetix> SWF, even.
06:07:53 <poetix> There are Flash-based multi-format document viewers, I believe
06:08:06 <poetix> Although they may depend on rasterisation of documents at the server side
06:09:57 <musasabi> opera supports svg.
06:10:30 <poetix> *!?# opera
06:10:44 * poetix clamps his hand over his mouth in horror
06:10:59 <poetix> Sorry - didn't mean to say that out loud...
06:11:15 <musasabi> it is actually quite nice :-)
06:11:47 <poetix> I ought to try it again some time, I guess.
06:12:29 <poetix> It kind of goes in the same "why bother" compartment of my brain as things like non-free reimplementations of BeOS.
06:13:14 * Lemmih has finally merged HSP with FastCGI.
06:13:34 <wilx> Hmm, how would you construct STRef to value that contains STRef to itself?
06:18:01 <musasabi> wilx: mdo.
06:18:30 <paolo> mdo is nifty
06:23:40 <sylvan> Lemmih: what does that mean for those of us who don't know what FastCGI is? =)
06:26:58 <frederik> i want to turn a value into a string, if it is a Char i want to do (\x -> [x]), otherwise if it is an instance of Show i want to 'show' it. how do i do this? i tried to define two instances and ghc complains
06:27:04 <musasabi> Lemmih: Where is the code? http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~d00nibro/hsp doesn't have it at least...
06:27:05 * boegel greets the crowd from his new workstation

06:27:49 <frederik>      Use -fallow-incoherent-instances to use the first choice above)
06:28:16 <frederik> i'm calling it from a function where the value is still polymorphic
06:28:30 <musasabi> ah.
06:28:32 <frederik> but it is always an instance of Show
06:28:43 <musasabi> then there is no really good way.
06:28:51 <frederik> really?
06:28:52 <Lemmih> sylvan: Imagine something with the speed of O'Caml, the usability of PHP and the beauty of Haskell.
06:29:13 <frederik> PHP is usable?
06:29:21 <Lemmih> It's very easy to use.
06:29:48 <frederik> what is HSP? should i use it instead of WASH?
06:29:51 <sylvan> so what specifically did FastCGI bring?
06:30:00 <poetix> Fast...CGI
06:30:14 <paolo> Haskell Server Pages?
06:30:20 <poetix> (CGI requests are routed to a persistent process via interprocess calls)
06:30:34 <poetix> So no process startup overhead for each CGI invocation
06:31:12 <sylvan> well what does that mean in the context of HSP?
06:31:32 <Lemmih> 'page = <html><body> Hello world </body></html>' <- is valid HSP.
06:31:44 <poetix> Not having to depend on mod_haskell?
06:31:50 <sylvan> ah
06:32:09 <sylvan> gotcha
06:32:09 <paolo> WOW
06:32:15 <paolo> TH hackage?
06:32:16 <poetix> GHC-compiled runtimes rather than a hugs interpreter
06:32:25 <Lemmih> paolo: Preprocessor.
06:32:35 <paolo> Lemmih, neat ^__^
06:35:26 <Lemmih> musasabi: One moment.
06:36:33 <Lemmih> frederik: It's not quite stable yet.
06:37:17 <Itkovian> erm, boegel ...
06:38:11 <musasabi> Lemmih: mainly I would be interested in syncing changes between the three versions.
06:38:17 <sylvan> Why is the lookup function for Data.HashTable not pure?
06:39:10 <boegel> @seen shapr
06:39:11 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell. Last spoke 33 minutes and 11 seconds ago.
06:39:20 <boegel> shapr: FLM up yet ?
06:39:34 <Lemmih> sylvan: Because it depends on the state of the hashtable.
06:40:33 <sylvan> Ah, silly me.. I'd like a pure HashTable though.. So you'd fill it up with mappings at the start and then have access to O(1) lookups
06:40:57 <sylvan> Maybe I'll write one using Array sometime...
06:41:26 <Lemmih> Yeah, it's a misfeature that it's in the IO monad.
06:42:20 <sylvan> Hell, I have nothing to do. I'll just write a pure version and be done with it..
06:43:25 <Lemmih> musasabi: Most of your changes are incompatible with mine, I think.
06:45:50 * boegel whistles
06:46:11 <Lemmih> musasabi: darcs repo: http://scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/hsp/
06:48:19 <musasabi> hmm one huge patch.
07:02:04 <Itkovian> Lemmih: any exmaples?
07:04:07 <Lemmih> Itkovian: I'm working on it.
07:12:20 * CosmicRay prepares to upload ldap-haskell to sid
07:13:45 <Wed19142> "return $ doit a"      versus        "return . doit $ a"               ?
07:14:59 <Igloo> The former, IMO
07:15:34 <kosmikus> yes
07:17:07 <Matt-W> I know what the former actually means, so if it's a popularity contest I'd go with that
07:17:37 <Matt-W> my Haskell's so rusty, why am I even here?
07:18:53 * beelsebo1 wonders what you're talking about
07:21:12 <CosmicRay> (return . doit) is a function
07:21:30 <CosmicRay> you are applying that function to one argument
07:21:39 <CosmicRay> (return . doit) a is the same as return . doit $ a
07:21:45 <CosmicRay> the $ is merely syntactic sugar.
07:21:58 <CosmicRay> also, return $ doit a is the same as return (doit a)
07:22:42 <Wed19142> yeah, i guess the former is definitly preferred because if doit took more than 1 argument the latter wouldnt work anymore without adding extra dots for every argument
07:22:53 <Igloo> I wouldn't say it's syntactic sugar; it's a function
07:23:04 <Wed19142> yeah, function
07:23:45 <vegai> http://supybot.com/Members/jemfinch/haskell-sucks/document_view ;-)
07:23:55 <CosmicRay> Igloo: yes, it's a function, but to me that's an implementation detail for some syntactic sugar
07:24:14 <Igloo> CosmicRay: So the language is entirely syntactic sugar in your eyes?
07:24:15 <CosmicRay> why do I recognize that jemfinch name...
07:24:33 <boegel> does anyone know if shapr threw FLM online yet ?
07:24:34 <vegai> CosmicRay: perhaps you were into python earlier?
07:24:43 <CosmicRay> vegai: indeed I was
07:24:55 <CosmicRay> Igloo: heh
07:25:18 <musasabi> boegel: I don't think so.
07:30:48 <Lemmih> Itkovian: http://212.242.49.100/hsp/Browse
07:31:21 <Lemmih> I'm hosing it myself so it's slow as hell. (:
07:31:58 <Itkovian> lol
07:32:03 <Itkovian> it looks nice enough
07:32:16 <Itkovian> what's the webserver?
07:33:00 <Itkovian> it would be cool to have an apache module for it ...
07:33:12 <^ruffen_> im really stuck on a haskell program, is it possible to ask for help here?
07:33:27 <Lemmih> Itkovian: Apache/2.0.54
07:33:27 <paolo> Lemmih, that's _so_ nifty!  I see Haskell code inside the template.
07:34:03 <Itkovian> ^ruffen_: yes, but we won't do yr homework
07:34:45 <^ruffen_> havent asked for that....
07:35:02 <^ruffen_> if i did, id ask for you guys to do the whole program
07:35:29 <Itkovian> well, pose yr question then
07:35:45 <Lemmih> Itkovian: It's FastCGI so it works for Apache, Microsoft ISS and many more.
07:35:53 <Itkovian> it's just that sometimes people get pissed if you won't code the solutiuon for them and we're a civilised bunch
07:36:12 <Itkovian> Lemmih:  right, you said something like that
07:36:14 <^ruffen_> hehe im trying to be civilised to:)
07:37:28 <paolo> Lemmih, any url to bookmark about this stuff?  No time now, but I want to dig it sometime.
07:38:08 <Lemmih> @google Haskell Server Pages
07:38:09 <lambdabot> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~d00nibro/hsp/
07:38:59 <boegel> ^ruffen_, ask away !
07:40:45 <^ruffen_> | (((coeff1,expon1):poly1) == [] && ((coeff2, expon2):poly2) === []) = [] --> i have to admit posting code is dodgy, but im trying to check if the list is empty, but this statement wont do anything at all?
07:41:27 <^ruffen_> when i run it, it gives me pattern match failure when it comes to the end of the list
07:41:45 * CosmicRay posted a rebuttal at http://supybot.com/Members/jemfinch/haskell-sucks/document_view
07:41:59 <CosmicRay> vegai: what is jemfinch known for?
07:42:03 <Itkovian> ^ruffen_: try null list
07:42:29 <^ruffen_> running it on a null list?
07:42:29 <Itkovian> if you have a (x:xs) then the list contains at least a single element!
07:42:40 <sylvan> "null []" => True
07:42:42 <Itkovian> no, 'null list'
07:42:49 <sylvan> "null (x:_)" => False
07:42:56 <Itkovian> right
07:42:58 <Itkovian> thx sylvan
07:43:05 <^ruffen_> thnx
07:45:28 <sylvan> What's the rule of thumb for how many "buckets" you need in a HashTable implementation if the expected number of elements is "n"?
07:45:38 <sylvan> I can't remember.. Something like sqrt(2)*n?
07:47:18 <Lemmih> CosmicRay: Nice response.
07:48:46 <Itkovian> sylvan: erm, I alway heard a nice prime higher than n ;-)
07:50:28 <tromp> depends on bucket implementation
07:50:40 <tromp> are they linked lists, or buffers?
07:50:53 <sylvan> linked lists
07:51:12 <sylvan> Array Int32 [(key,value)] to be precise
07:51:26 <tromp> do you want to save memory?
07:51:32 <sylvan> well somewhat =)
07:51:59 <tromp> take a prime near n to get short lists on average
07:52:08 <sylvan> I thought that it was the hash function that's supposed to do modulo with a large prime number?
07:52:10 <tromp> but that will leave many empty lists of course
07:52:34 <tromp> take a prime near n/16 to get avg list length of 16 ... etc
07:52:43 <tromp> with very few empty lists
07:52:57 <sylvan> Does it _need_ to be a prime?
07:53:05 <Itkovian> preferably
07:53:11 <Itkovian> because that determines the bucket
07:53:25 <sylvan> so it isn't enough if the hash function is somethhing like "(...) `mod` largePrime"
07:53:26 <tromp> primes are good at producing flat distribution over buckets
07:53:29 <CosmicRay> Lemmih: thanks
07:53:29 <Itkovian> well, it can determine the bucket
07:53:44 <Itkovian> sylvan: that usually wrks fine enough imho
07:53:52 <sylvan> Wonder how Data.HashTable does it...
07:54:06 <sylvan> I don't wanna compute primes on the fly... Maybe the user should just supply the hash-table size
07:54:08 <tromp> don't take modulo a 2-power:(
07:54:15 <tromp> that's the worst
07:54:37 <tromp> a random odd number will do reasonably well
07:55:01 <tromp> or buildin a small table of primes of various sizes
07:55:14 <sylvan> how about just having "makeOdd n" as the length?
07:55:29 <sylvan> where makeOdd just adds 1 for even numbers..
07:55:51 <paolo> odds = 1 : (map (+2) odds)
07:56:01 <tromp> well, a 2power plus or minus one can still give poor distribution depending on data
07:56:03 <paolo> @eval let odds = 1 : (map (+2) odds) in take 10 odds
07:56:10 <lambdabot> [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]
07:56:49 <sylvan> The thing is, I know exactly the number of elements beforehand, it's immutable
07:57:02 <tromp> so pick your prime
07:57:22 <sylvan> Bah, then I still have to compute a prime...
07:57:29 <sylvan> which could get expensive
07:57:49 <tromp> you compute it outside your program
07:58:41 <sylvan> well how many primes should I compute?
07:58:52 <tromp> if n is fixed... just one
07:58:59 <sylvan> well it's fixed per hashtable
07:59:14 <tromp> obviously:)
07:59:17 <sylvan> so a single hashtable won't ever get anything inserted into it after it's created
07:59:29 <musasabi> sylvan: just use a fixed list of primes each about two times larger than the previous.
07:59:31 <sylvan> but one hashtable might have 3 elements and another five million
08:00:22 <tromp> just pick them some constant factor apart, like  1.5 or 2
08:01:19 <sylvan> yeah okay, I'll just compute a hundred or so primes and store them...
08:01:31 <tromp> http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/pearls.html#sieve has a simple generator if u dont have one in haskell
08:01:44 <musasabi> googling a list is quite easy
08:03:08 <CosmicRay> musasabi: try gmane.org
08:03:43 <musasabi> for a list of primes?
08:03:58 <CosmicRay> for a better way to search lists
08:04:09 <^ruffen_> i dont want to bother you to much, but when i | list == [], it skips the last item in the list?
08:04:35 <sylvan> tromp: I wrote one in the time it took you to find that link =)
08:04:48 <sylvan> haskell is nice
08:05:02 <tromp> that one is quite a bit faster though
08:05:22 <tromp> and easily produces primes in the billions
08:05:28 <sylvan> maybe so, but I'll just store them in code anyway
08:06:49 <tromp> btw, it took me 2 secs to find that link from my homepage:)
08:06:54 <sylvan> =)
08:06:59 <tromp> you sure program fast:)
08:07:09 <paolo> And type fast :-)
08:07:34 <tromp> not too mention your debugging speed:)
08:07:55 <tromp> to
08:08:12 <paolo> tromp, you're an Haskell Go Person, right?
08:08:15 <Wed19142> i dont get it.....im doing a read in ghci and it parses perfectly to a certain datatype...i do it by reading in the file and it says no parse
08:08:24 <Wed19142> i escaped the strings...what more do i need
08:09:17 <tromp> i guess so
08:09:42 <paolo> tromp, did you see the US Masters final?
08:09:57 <tromp> nope
08:10:16 <tromp> unless it was the hsiang game
08:10:48 <paolo> tromp, hmm I can't confirm neither negate - I saw it live from wms on KGS (and it was on IGS too)
08:11:16 <tromp> i watched some Masters games on KGS
08:11:28 <tromp> but i think all pre-final
08:14:02 <paolo> It was a pretty boring game, and it was also adjurned... :-)
08:14:53 <Wed19142> how does one ffs read in a record using the Read class
08:15:10 <Wed19142> show dump a simple A{koe="vlaai"}
08:15:12 <tromp> who won then?
08:15:14 <Wed19142> dumps
08:15:26 <paolo> tromp, I don't know, that's why I asked at first glance, heh
08:15:37 <Wed19142> but read of the equivalent (with or without \") failes to parse
08:15:43 <Wed19142> any ideas?
08:15:58 <tromp> not my favorite kind of vlaai, koeienvlaai....
08:16:08 <paolo> Vlaai?
08:16:44 <tromp> dutch...
08:16:47 <Wed19142> reading (A \"vlaai\") is also not succesful
08:17:25 <paolo> It stands for?
08:17:40 <Cale> Wed19142: when it's a record, you need to read things that look like records
08:18:05 <Cale> Wed19142: unfortunately it doesn't parse all the syntax which would be acceptable in a program
08:18:09 <shapr> CosmicRay: In my opinion, jemfinch is a bozo.
08:18:19 <Wed19142> Cale, thats why i tried the tupled approach
08:19:31 <CosmicRay> shapr: yes, I had smoewhat of a negative memory of him too
08:19:33 <CosmicRay> I just can't figure out why
08:20:30 <shapr> I would call him a closed minded fanatic.
08:20:43 <Cale> hey, that is odd
08:21:24 <Cale> I'll have a look at the report
08:21:33 <Wed19142> trying to read something of type "data A = A{koe::String}" i tried reading A{koe="vlaai"} and (A ("vlaai")) and (A "vlaai") and all of the former with the " signs escaped
08:21:38 <CosmicRay> shapr: was he in this channel once?
08:21:54 <shapr> He spreads disinformation about me. That makes me angry.
08:22:01 <shapr> Yes, often. And he was in #darcs quite a bit.
08:22:05 <CosmicRay> ah, that is no good.
08:22:11 <Wed19142> shapr, which kind of disinformation?
08:22:55 <Cale> Wed19142: yeah, in general, the derived Read instance ought to be able to read what the derived Show instance produces
08:23:33 <shapr> jemfinch claimed that he had come up with a better patch theory than darcs has. Upon examining his patch theory, I concluded that he did not understand darcs patch theory. He claimed he didn't need to understand all of darcs' patch theory to make something better. My objections to his patch theory were from the parts he didn't understand, so he dismissed my arguments.
08:23:54 <shapr> Then later he told people on #darcs that I would only discuss patch theory with them if they completely understood darcs patch theory.
08:24:14 <Cale> Wed19142: ah, make sure that the type is made obvious
08:24:23 <CosmicRay> ahh, I remember this.
08:24:30 <Wed19142> im doing a 'read :: A'
08:24:38 <paolo> shapr, indeed.
08:24:50 <Lemmih> @seen jemfinch
08:24:51 <lambdabot> I saw jemfinch leaving #haskell 2 months, 20 days, 1 hour, 37
08:24:51 <lambdabot> minutes and 39 seconds ago, and I have missed 1 month, 5 days, 3
08:24:51 <lambdabot> hours, 11 minutes and 19 seconds since then.
08:25:00 <Cale> Wed19142: is your type called A?
08:25:02 <shapr> In reality, I got tired of trying to explain stuff to jemfinch that he should read and learn by himself, and told him I wouldn't discuss any further with him until he understood *all* of darcs patch theory.
08:25:03 <CosmicRay> lambdabot: your uptime sucks
08:25:20 <Cale> Wed19142: (your constructor is called A, at least)
08:25:37 <shapr> He was making me spend hours explaining stuff to him because he didn't understand what he was talking about.
08:25:42 <Cale> data RecType = A { name :: String } deriving (Show, Read)
08:25:49 <Cale> *Main> read(show (A "Hello")) :: RecType
08:25:49 <Cale> A {name = "Hello"}
08:25:51 <shapr> I do *not* like wasting my time, it is the one resource I can never have more of.
08:26:56 <shapr> I am happy to discuss and explain, but I refuse to spoon feed someone on a regular basis.
08:27:30 <shapr> (well, except myself)
08:27:59 <Lemmih> heh
08:28:06 <shapr> Cale: Oh that's cool, I never thought about derived Read syntax for records.
08:28:19 * Wed19142 his pants drop to the floor
08:28:23 <Wed19142> it works now
08:28:30 <Wed19142> i swear i tried it without the escaping
08:28:32 <Wed19142> darn
08:29:56 <shapr> So, who wants to write an article for TMR?
08:30:13 * basti_ has got csound running again.
08:30:43 <shapr> tromp: Want to write about lambda cal, Kolmogorov, or connect four?
08:31:00 <shapr> tromp: You could write about simulating reclining bikes in Haskell =)
08:31:18 <shapr> pejo: Want to write a TMR article about Timber?
08:31:42 <shapr> basti_: yeah!
08:31:49 <shapr> I'd like to see more csound stuff.
08:32:02 <shapr> chucky: Want to write a TMR article about HaskellDB?
08:32:18 <shapr> chucky: Or maybe a summary of the Haskell 2 effort?
08:32:33 <shapr> shapr: Want to write an article about software testing in Haskell?
08:32:35 <shapr> shapr: yes!
08:32:41 * shapr boings randomly
08:32:48 * liyang bounces shapr 
08:33:03 * shapr rebounds off the ceiling
08:33:19 <shapr> Hiya liyang! Want to write for TMR?
08:33:20 <wilx> Hmm, is GHC 6.4 masked on Gentoo or something?
08:33:36 <liyang> shapr: too busy writing my MSc thesis. >.<;;
08:33:40 <shapr> Ah, too bad.
08:33:53 <shapr> seafood: Want to write about Template Haskell for TMR?
08:34:14 <basti_> i think i'll make a vocoder in csound with haskell.
08:34:22 * paolo recalls the @bug-random-people-for-tmr-articles idea
08:35:13 <pejo> shapr, any year now. ;)
08:35:42 <tromp> sorry shapr, too many distractions now
08:35:44 <Wed19142> will .hi files be renewed everytime i recompile a .o ?
08:35:51 <shapr> tromp: ok
08:35:55 <shapr> pejo: Yeah, someday!
08:36:04 <musasabi> Wed19142: yes.
08:36:07 <pejo> shapr, a bit more seriously, uhm. I don't want to blow any horns before there's something to show to the world. And I'm not sure I'll be on the project in a year from now.
08:36:23 <tromp> i'm heavily into go research
08:36:27 <musasabi> of course if the .o is not recompiled the .hi is not touched either.
08:36:30 <shapr> pejo: It would be good publicity.
08:36:40 <shapr> tromp: Any Haskell code used in your Go research?
08:37:03 <tromp> yes, i wrote a Chinese Remainder solver yesterday:)
08:37:16 <shapr> @google chinese remainder go
08:37:17 <lambdabot> http://www.math.sfu.ca/histmath/China/3rdCenturyBC/CRP1.html
08:37:20 <tromp> but the grunt of the work needs to be done in C
08:37:43 <liyang> (I've always wanted to implement some multimedia compression codec in Haskell and see how much easier it would be with Haskell...)
08:37:46 <pejo> shapr, well, when it's ready. :-) (Pretend we're Debian..)
08:37:55 <Wed19142> ah the problem is im importing a module that already has a main....so linking complains about having multiple definitions of things
08:38:02 <shapr> pejo: heh, fair enough
08:38:16 <shapr> tromp: That's cool. Is your code online?
08:38:21 <tromp> try googling for 37249792307686396442294904767024517674249157948208717533254799550970595875237705
08:38:26 <tromp> not yet
08:38:55 <shapr> liyang: Someone did that recently, as part of the BBC Dirac project, a researcher wrote an MPEG decompressor in Haskell.
08:39:08 <liyang> Damn.

08:40:36 <liyang> shapr: But then again that's probably a testament to said researcher's coding ability rather than how C is a horrible choice of implementation language. (Or how the standardisation process works with the reference code being passed from company to company...)
08:41:12 <Wed19142> crap
08:41:59 <Wed19142> multiple definition of `ZCMain_main_closure'
08:42:21 <Narrenschiff> I thought it might be a fun beginners project to play with FM synthesis in Haskell. Thoughtricky for a dunce like me to actually produce any sound from it.
08:44:46 <liyang> shapr: Maybe I could write an article on that once I get this done. (October. -_-;)
08:48:17 <shapr> liyang: Good idea
08:48:28 <shapr> Narrenschiff: Seen Haskore and haskelldsp.sf.net?
08:48:39 <shapr> conal: Greetings! How's code?
08:48:44 <basti_> Narrenschiff: whats tricky about producing sound?
08:48:58 * Narrenschiff looks!
08:49:39 <conal> shapr: hi.  code's slow.  i've not been focused on or inspired about coding lately.  more NVC activity, though.
08:50:26 <Narrenschiff> I admit, I'm thinking about it because my DX7 is in for repairs and I'm getting withdrawral symptoms.
08:50:48 <basti_> heh
08:51:37 <wilx> Hmm, how should I organize tests of a module?
08:52:40 <shapr> What's a dx7?
08:52:45 <basti_> shapr: a synthesizer.
08:52:46 <shapr> conal: What inspires you?
08:52:53 <conal> shapr: though i have started to play with redoing Pan/Vertigo-style rewriting via GADTs.  i'm curious how it will work out.  i want to have a whole new code-base, so there's no microsoft restrictions.  and of course run on linux etc.
08:53:11 <basti_> you probably know the sound, it's extremely popular... speciality are "airy" and "glassy" sounds.
08:53:22 <Narrenschiff> as used in 80s pop (all of it)
08:53:47 <Narrenschiff> no one could program the thing, though, so they just used the presets.
08:53:52 <basti_> *g*
08:58:07 <shapr> conal: Lack of microsoft restrictions will definitely increase the popularity of your code in the OSS & Linux usergroups.
08:58:37 <conal> that's my hope.  i'd really like to resurrect it.
08:59:45 <wilx> Hmm, can tell GHC that I want to export some funcs from my module but only as qualified?
09:03:20 <shapr> How do GADTs change Pan?
09:04:55 <kosmikus> probably the usual "turn combinators into data constructors", therefore more processing and optimization possibilities
09:05:41 <vegai> CosmicRay: jemfinch is known for knowing python
09:06:12 <liyang> shapr: it doesn't help that someone called Barry Haskell wrote an introduction to MPEG. >.<; Do you have any references / links for the MPEG decompressor you mentioned?
09:06:40 <shapr> @seen df_
09:06:41 <lambdabot> Last time I saw df_ was when I left #haskell 1 month, 11 days, 14
09:06:41 <lambdabot> hours, 10 minutes and 26 seconds ago, and I have missed 21 days, 4
09:06:41 <lambdabot> hours, 36 minutes and 20 seconds since then.
09:06:48 <shapr> @seen df`
09:06:49 <lambdabot> I haven't seen df`.
09:06:51 <shapr> @seen df
09:06:52 <lambdabot> df has changed nick to df_.
09:06:52 <lambdabot> Last time I saw df_ was when I left #haskell 1 month, 11 days, 14
09:06:52 <lambdabot> hours, 10 minutes and 37 seconds ago, and I have missed 21 days, 4
09:06:52 <lambdabot> hours, 36 minutes and 20 seconds since then.
09:07:27 <conal> shapr: in Pan's syntax representation, i used a layer of untyped constructors, a layer of smart untyped constructors, and a typed wrapper with phantom types.  GADTs seem to be a cleaner alternative, allowing more static typing in the syntax rep.
09:08:17 <conal> @hoogle [a] ->[a]
09:08:18 <lambdabot> Prelude.tail :: ([a] -> [a])
09:08:18 <lambdabot> Prelude.init :: ([a] -> [a])
09:08:18 <lambdabot> Prelude.reverse :: ([a] -> [a])
09:08:30 <conal> ah: init.
09:09:25 <liyang> (shapr: is that who I should be poking?)
09:09:45 <shapr> liyang: Yeah, df wrote it. I have a copy around here somewhere, but I'm not sure where.
09:10:20 <liyang> nevermind. I'll poke you about it some other time. :)
09:11:09 <shapr> If I find it, I'll tell you.
09:11:59 <liyang> /msg me plz if you do. :)
09:12:03 <shapr> will do
09:25:26 <Oejet> Heja Sverige!
09:26:40 <ibid> hrm... svenska-talande b√§ttre folk...
09:26:40 <ibid> :)
09:29:19 <Oejet> Heja Suomi! :-)
09:29:40 <Oejet> The Swedes are doing better though.
09:31:19 <ibid> oh, that
09:32:10 <ibid> the only thing that i find interesting in that event is that the athletes live where i spent a week and a half last month
09:35:33 <musasabi> The fence is some 50m from here...
09:36:16 <ibid> the infamous fence
09:36:59 <SyntaxNinja> y0
09:37:04 * SyntaxNinja is not infamous!
09:37:11 <paolo> Hiya SyntaxNinja!
09:37:15 <ibid> you are a fence?
09:37:21 <ibid> what do you fence?
09:37:28 <SyntaxNinja> hi paolo
09:37:46 <ibid> (we were talking about the fence that "protects" the athletes in the athletes' village)
09:37:50 <SyntaxNinja> fences, obviosly
09:38:08 <SyntaxNinja> ibid: why quotes around protects?
09:38:24 <SyntaxNinja> olympics you mean?
09:38:36 <ibid> SyntaxNinja: there are no olympic games in progress afaik
09:39:23 <ibid> SyntaxNinja: unless there are live guards spread around the whole fence so that each has eye contact to his neighbours, it's mostly symbolic
09:39:27 * SyntaxNinja is trying to catch up on the discussion
09:39:32 <ibid> at least where terrorism is concerned
09:39:52 <ibid> SyntaxNinja: i spent a week and a half last month where the athletes
09:39:56 <ibid> ' village is now~
09:40:06 <ibid> i saw the fence in construction
09:40:40 <SyntaxNinja> it doesn't protect them from each-other, obviously: http://www.katu.com/sports/story.asp?ID=69573
09:40:46 <musasabi> There are some live guards (military police) and the fence is about 2m chicken wire.
09:41:39 <ibid> of course, it will deter petty crime
09:42:13 <musasabi> of course if someone wanted to go in there *is* the sea.
09:42:55 <ibid> yeah
09:43:34 <ibid> i was rather mad when the fence blocked a perfectly valid walking lane
09:44:23 <paolo> Could you help me about an issue?  What happens if you do "pkg-config foo --help" on your boxes?
09:44:43 <paolo> (where foo can be any string)
09:44:53 <ibid> shows help, won't paste it
09:45:06 <paolo> Oh.  Here it segfaults.
09:45:21 <paolo>   -, ----help=U\uffff\uffff\uffff\uffff\uffff\uffffE\uffffx?t%\uffffD            Help options
09:45:21 <paolo> Segmentation fault
09:45:42 <paolo> It's version 0.19
09:46:34 <ibid> here too
09:46:39 <paolo> Ah-ha! :-)
09:46:43 <ibid> debian sid, upgraded this week
09:46:48 <musasabi> ibid: I think the busses starting 1km farther away from home is quite annoying.
09:47:09 <ibid> musasabi: they don't go to the otaniemi final stop?
09:47:36 <musasabi> ibid: no, only to the shopping centre.
09:47:53 <ibid> ok
09:48:08 <ibid> musasabi: were you at debconf, btw?
09:48:14 <musasabi> and as we live in "teekkarikyl‰" that is quite annoying.
09:48:50 <musasabi> ibid: I am not a Debian dev and had stuff for the most days so I was just there on the opening day.
09:48:57 <ibid> su?
09:49:05 <musasabi> yes.
09:49:23 <ibid> ok
09:51:33 <beelsebo1> ow... stabbing yourself with a pen is a bad thing
09:52:50 <sylvan> conal: what will be your target shader language? Perhaps HLSL or Cg or something instead of pure asm?
09:53:46 <conal> sylvan: right now, i'm not planning to redo vertigo.  if i did, i think i'd still target asm.
09:55:01 <conal> but if someone were interested in a new vertigo (running on linux etc), i'd be very interested in collaboraing.
09:55:50 <sylvan> I have far to little spare time right now, but in the future I'd like to do a Haskell game engine and for that I'd really like the shader component to be first class haskell data
09:56:33 <sylvan> (so you could easily combine different shadowing approaches, material shaders, and lighting shaders by just combinbing the haskell data type and then have semi-optimized shaders be output in GPU asm)
09:56:56 <conal> i see.  sounds like a fun project.
09:57:32 <sylvan> yep... I'll see if I can work it into one of the graphics courses I'll take this year...
09:58:27 <conal> sounds good.
10:00:22 <basti_> sylvan: ever heard of "the yampa arcade"?
10:03:11 <beelsebo1> yay, hat-anim works again
10:03:19 <beelsebo1> now I can get on with hat-delta again
10:03:34 <paolo> basti_, I did, but what is it exactly?
10:03:56 <basti_> paolo: a demonstration of how arrows can be used for interactive environments
10:04:04 <paolo> ooh.
10:04:09 <basti_> didnt you notice?
10:04:47 <paolo> Nope.
10:04:53 <paolo> @google the yampa arcade
10:04:55 <lambdabot> http://www.ida.liu.se/~henni/Publications/hw2003.pdf
10:05:05 <sylvan> basti_ nope
10:05:31 <basti_> sylvan: you should do so, for further inspiration
10:05:53 <sylvan> I'm reading the paper now
10:06:03 <basti_> :)
10:32:27 <shapr> Hm, for some reason ghc is taking a very long time to link my program.
10:32:37 * shapr is suspicious
10:33:15 <shapr> Oh, no it's not... doh.
10:35:58 <lispy> shapr: linked it lazily?
10:36:59 <shapr> It was working fine, it's my test program that wasn't responding.
10:37:07 <CosmicRay> lispy: isn't that what dynamic linking is? ;-)
10:37:14 <shapr> I have: compile-command: "ghc --make Test_FLM -o Test_FLM && ./Test_FLM"
10:42:34 <paolo>  && play monkey-woot.wav || play monkey-aww.wav
10:43:01 <shapr> I like that trick, but I don't usually need it for this.
10:44:02 <paolo> I don't have proper sounds for that, tough :-\
10:44:24 <shapr> Want me to send them to you?
10:44:32 <shapr> They're part of emacs.
10:44:42 <paolo> Ah, where are them?  I do indeed have emacs.
10:44:50 <SyntaxNinja> hi shapr!
10:44:54 <paolo> Hmm, I have GNUmacs, in fact
10:45:01 <shapr> paolo: Part of xemacs21
10:45:06 <shapr> hiya SyntaxNinja!
10:45:13 <paolo> OK, ready to get them :-)
10:45:25 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: how's hack
10:45:43 * SyntaxNinja got a 300 gig externam hard drive yesterday. it took forever to make it ext3.
10:45:56 <shapr> Hack is good! FLM is starting to move again.
10:46:01 <paolo> SyntaxNinja, WOAH
10:46:17 <paolo> I got a 30Gb one from a friend on which I put ubuntu breezy, gee.
10:46:17 <shapr> I'd suggest reiser4 except that 4k stacks really speeds up my kernel :-/
10:46:45 <paolo> shapr, so I don't have xemacs21 :-\  Would you put them online?
10:46:49 <shapr> sure
10:47:03 <SyntaxNinja> well, you know how you always get a hard drive that you think will be big enough, and then someone goes and invents something like mp3 and you get a digitll camera, and before you know it...
10:47:21 <SyntaxNinja> well it's for backups. I need to back up 2 laptops + web sites + an ipod and all my digital photos.
10:47:27 <paolo> SyntaxNinja, indeed - but you wrote 300Gb.  I mean, 300.
10:47:29 <SyntaxNinja> and I want it ti scale :)
10:48:00 <SyntaxNinja> it actually was not that expensive, considering that it'll solve all of my backup problems for hte foreseeable future.
10:48:23 <paolo> w4r3z dude
10:48:52 <shapr> paolo: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/{monkey,yeep}.wav and alias fin='aplay -q ~/.bin/monkey.wav ~/.bin/monkey.wav ~/.bin/monkey.wav' and alias die='aplay -q ~/.bin/yeep.wav ~/.bin/yeep.wav' so you can use: long-process && fin || die
10:49:01 <wilx> Is ext3 really such a good idea?
10:49:19 <SyntaxNinja> wilx: it came as vfat. do you have a better suggestion?
10:49:39 <wilx> I mean, what I have heard and read about different file systems almost anything would be better.
10:49:47 <wilx> Like jfs, xfs, reiserfs...
10:49:52 <shapr> ext3 is easy to recover.
10:50:05 <SyntaxNinja> I thought that ext3 was more stable than those others.
10:50:09 <lispy> the ability to go between ext2 and ext3 is the reason i use it
10:50:19 <lispy> it's come in handy ;)
10:50:22 <wilx> Why?
10:50:35 <paolo> shapr, haha, they're great.
10:50:44 <shapr> Because ext3 is easy to mount as ext2, and there are lots of existing ext2/3 recovery tools.
10:50:54 <wilx> I think you would have hard time finding any (Linux) kernel that doesn't support the three I named.
10:50:59 <paolo> thank you.
10:51:00 <wilx> Hmm.
10:51:07 <CosmicRay> I'd say that ext3 is indeed the most error-proof fs for linux
10:51:16 <SyntaxNinja> and that's what I'm going for :)
10:51:32 <shapr> paolo: Glad you like it :-)
10:51:36 <CosmicRay> however, I would say that reiser4 is a *very* close second, and is also substantially faster
10:51:41 <mflux> why don't they simply write a filesystem and prove that it works, always!
10:51:48 <paolo> yeep yeep!
10:51:54 <CosmicRay> I would never suggest reiser3, jfs, or xfs though
10:52:01 <mflux> xfs has worked great for me
10:52:12 <mflux> even when there's been holes in the disk
10:52:16 <CosmicRay> it has known problems on crashes
10:52:17 <pejo> I'm with SyntaxNinja on this part I must say. Unless you have a UPS and good hardware it's nice to stick to those filesystems that will hopefully have most of your stuff on them. Checck Theodore T'so's mails on lkml about Reiser/Ext3.
10:52:19 <mflux> had to mount it with -o norecovery
10:52:24 <mflux> , though
10:52:26 <CosmicRay> see http://changelog.complete.org/node/208
10:52:35 <shapr> CosmicRay: my problem with reiser4 is that it doesn't work with 4k stacks, and my kernel is noticeably faster with 4k stacks.
10:52:38 <mflux> I don't have many crashes
10:52:42 <mflux> plus I have ups
10:52:55 <CosmicRay> mflux: it only takes one to screw you
10:53:16 <CosmicRay> pejo: is he talking about reiser3 or reiser4?
10:53:20 <paolo> shapr, for bash: function try () { $* && fin || die } and then "try make" or something :-)
10:53:32 <shapr> I use zsh
10:53:40 <paolo> It's probably similar.
10:53:54 <shapr> Ah, I see, useful function.
10:53:59 <paolo> Indeed :-)
10:54:17 <pejo> CosmicRay, 4 iirc. I think Reiser basically said "Don't get flaky hardware". Well, most people have PC's at home. :-)
10:54:19 <shapr> Oh hey, can you resend erc-track-dwim? via email?
10:54:24 <paolo> eek eek eek
10:54:29 <paolo> shapr, sure!
10:54:31 <mflux> with ext3 I've found that the system still, when given the opportunity to do so with e2fsck, finds problems in the fs. but maybe I should do the same test with xfs too ;)
10:54:36 <vegai> I've been using jfs for everything for quite a while :
10:54:47 <CosmicRay> pejo: my understanding, and this is backed up by actual experience, is that reiser4 is very robust in the face of crashes.
10:54:51 <SamB> what are 4k stacks?
10:54:54 <mflux> I suppose that's rare
10:54:55 <CosmicRay> pejo: however, if you have flaky hardware, bets are off with any filesystem.
10:55:12 <vegai> SamB: kernel stacks that are 4 kilobytes in size
10:55:21 <SyntaxNinja> maybe I'll try a different filesystem on another device
10:55:25 <paolo> shapr, is shae@ right?
10:55:26 <SamB> that sounds insanely small!
10:55:30 <vegai> I guess 8KB is the 'regular' size?
10:55:43 <vegai> SamB: well, perhaps not for a kernel
10:55:50 <shapr> SamB: Stacks were always 8k until recently, but that required finding two contiguous pages. 4k stacks mean easier allocation of stacks, and faster response on my system.
10:55:53 <shapr> paolo: yes.
10:55:55 <pejo> CosmicRay, sure.
10:56:07 <CosmicRay> shapr: I *think*, but am not certain, that reiser4 is compatible with 4k stacks these days
10:56:21 <shapr> Not the debian reiser4 patch I've got, sadly.
10:56:46 <CosmicRay> shapr: that patch is chronically outdated
10:56:53 <CosmicRay> I've submitted bugs about it twice
10:56:59 <SamB> you'd think it would be drop-dead-simple to keep a freelist of 8k stacks
10:57:00 <CosmicRay> it usually gets fixed about 2 weeks after I submit a bug
10:57:01 <shapr> Sucks, debs are so handy.
10:57:08 <SamB> (one per CPU on a multiproc system, of course)
10:57:18 <CosmicRay> there's a nice diff on namesys.com
10:57:26 <CosmicRay> or you can use a mm kernel, which has reiser4 integrated
10:58:52 <paolo> shapr, sent.
10:58:57 <shapr> paolo: Thanks!
10:59:30 <shapr> Ah, I didn't even know elisp could have namespaces.
11:00:22 <paolo> I suspect an a-la-cee behavior.
11:00:40 <paolo> I could be wrong, tho.
11:00:54 <paolo> OK, it _has_ namespaces :-)
11:01:19 <paolo> forcer fooled me, it hasn't, I think :-P
11:02:04 <paolo> It doesn't, ":" is just a valid symbol names character.
11:02:11 <SamB> heh
11:02:12 <shapr> Ah, ok.
11:02:57 <SamB> if it had, you'd probably have to use something like defpackage to define them...
11:03:01 <lispy> what is raid 10?
11:03:12 <CosmicRay> mirroring and striping
11:03:25 <lispy> heh, wrong channel, but i guess someone still knew :)
11:03:31 <lispy> thanks
11:03:48 <shapr> #haskell is shockingly informed.
11:03:54 <SamB> how is this the wrong channel?
11:04:11 <zamez> does anyone know a tool that will monitor a mailing list and report threads that have had no reply from someone in a set of people in a certain number of days?
11:04:50 <SamB> this is my preferred channel for generic Linux and Unix help ;-)
11:05:01 <lispy> SamB: as in, not the channel i meant to ask that question in :)
11:05:17 <shapr> zamez: Would be easy enough to write with hsemail.
11:05:46 <zamez> "Did you mean: hotmail"
11:05:50 <zamez> heh
11:06:04 <shapr> No, I meant Peter Simons' hsemail message parsers.
11:06:17 <zamez> yeah, I was googling it
11:06:18 <shapr> That and a cron job that runs once a day, it'd be easy.
11:06:37 <shapr> Though you're better off with CosmicRay's MissingH, it has all the best parts of hsemail and WASHMail.
11:06:37 <zamez> I'll have a look, thanks
11:07:19 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: yeah, for a bunch of impractical academics who work in a language where you can't even perform IO, #haskell seems to know a lot bout Linux & unix.
11:07:48 <shapr> Good point :-)
11:08:51 <Philippa> I seem to be an interesting case there. I don't particularly, but some of my other coding inclinations mean I'm looking to push the ideas into particularly weird and supposedly hardcore-pragmatic areas
11:09:05 <vegai> perhaps that's not so paradoxical for a rabid windows-user, SyntaxNinja...
11:09:07 <monochrom> I don't think #haskell consists of impractical academics
11:10:14 <Philippa> I've been accused of it occasionally
11:10:22 <Philippa> but once you allow for how little of anything I do, it doesn't really stick
11:10:39 <Philippa> I mean, I'm vaguely involved in the "using haskell for real web apps" thing even if I'm not producing libs
11:10:43 <vegai> l
11:10:51 <Philippa> and that's a really obviously /good/ use for haskell
11:10:57 <vegai> l
11:11:02 <vegai> oh bugger, sorry
11:11:15 <Philippa> I mean, they're bending over backwards to reinvent FP in the form of XSLT anyway :-)
11:11:23 <monochrom> I don't buy the notion that an outsider's opinion is worthless.
11:11:49 <Philippa> here? Definitely not, it was by offering opinions that I stopped being an outsider
11:12:09 <monochrom> A Chinese proverb asserts that the outsider sees and the insider is lost.
11:12:19 <SyntaxNinja> vegai: you mean that rabid windows users consider Unix & linux to be academic and impractical?
11:12:29 <basti_> bbl
11:12:36 <Philippa> and a football one says the watcher sees more of the game :-)
11:12:45 <monochrom> Indeed.
11:12:54 <vegai> SyntaxNinja: that's highly stereotypical, of course, but ... yeah
11:13:13 <Philippa> I've not met any windows users who think that of unix
11:13:19 <Philippa> "too hard to use", sure
11:13:32 <Philippa> but the stereotype's beardy geeks rather than academics per se
11:14:04 <SamB> I wish I had met a lot of academics that know/use *nix
11:15:19 <SyntaxNinja> hm. true
11:15:21 <Philippa> it's kinda funny here. Some of the lecturers definitely do
11:15:41 <Philippa> I always get stuck demonstrating code on gmh's box because I'm just not that used to a *nix console these days
11:15:48 <Philippa> the number of times I've used the wrong slash is silly
11:15:59 <monochrom> haha
11:16:09 <SamB> I try to avoid using \ even on windows ;-)
11:16:09 <SyntaxNinja> on the first day of my OS class in undergrad, the windows-loving prof openly mocked Linux and the extreme hubris of its authors who think they could build something anywhere approaching the awesomeness of windows. "who do these people think they are"?
11:16:13 <SyntaxNinja> I dropped the class and took it later.
11:16:38 <SamB> who cares who they are?
11:16:51 <SamB> what counts is what Linux is
11:17:03 <SyntaxNinja> SamB: but it looks so much like a lambda!
11:17:26 <SamB> SyntaxNinja: do I really want to seperate my path components with a lambda?
11:18:24 <monochrom> Hahahaha, we should parode /. with a site called .\
11:18:41 <SyntaxNinja> that could be the new `joinPath` operator in System.Path! "usr" `.\` "local"...
11:19:01 <SyntaxNinja> monochrom: that was one of my ideas for naming sequence.complete.org
11:20:04 <monochrom> "Dot Backslash - Monads for Nerds, Combinators that Matter"
11:20:20 <stepcut> haha
11:21:08 <musasabi> One of the people who was supervising one project I was working on had a dvorak keyboard - much hilarity ensued when I tried to demo my code with emacs and shell.
11:21:17 <wilx> You know what I find totally confusing?
11:21:29 <wilx> That every haskell-mode.el says it is version 1.43.
11:21:35 <SyntaxNinja> musasabi: yesterday i was adding an account for someone and they typed their password and started to walk away, turned back to me and said, "that's a Dvorak keyboard, right?"
11:21:51 <monochrom> haha
11:21:51 <SyntaxNinja> wilx: not so!
11:21:51 <wilx> No matter whether it comes from -2.0.tar.gz or -1.45.tar.gz
11:22:06 <SyntaxNinja> wilx: the one with debian is correct :) I think I fixed that.
11:22:21 <wilx> Well, I am downloading it from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/
11:23:30 <SyntaxNinja> only solution: install debian ;)
11:25:09 <paolo> Mail the author?
11:52:06 <wilx> Hmm, anybody with XEmacs on Windows? haskell-mode promisses to fontify my lambdas to true lambda characters but it doesn't do that.
11:52:31 <wilx> And I did customize '(haskell-font-lock-symbols 'unicode)
11:53:09 <paolo> Oh, it does do that?  I'll try :-)
11:57:27 <paolo> wilx, hmm, it doesn't do anything here too.
11:59:02 <wilx> Have you customized the setting?
11:59:05 <paolo> Yup.
11:59:13 <paolo> Maybe there is something to add to the haskell-mode-hook?
12:00:26 <stepcut> (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-font-lock)
12:00:27 <stepcut> ??
12:02:24 <wilx> I have that.
12:02:53 <stepcut> well, I am out of ideas then :)
12:02:58 <paolo> turn-on-haskell-font-lock is obsolete.  Use turn-on-font-lock instead.
12:03:05 <paolo> (It says)
12:03:09 <stepcut> ah
12:03:25 <autrijus> @pl \fh -> hPutStr fh . toString
12:03:26 <lambdabot> (. toString) . hPutStr
12:03:26 <stepcut> done.
12:05:42 <wilx> Nichts. Nada. Nothing. Nanimo.
12:05:46 <wilx> It hates me.
12:18:09 <paolo> wilx, did you resolve?
12:18:59 <wilx> Nope.
12:19:13 <paolo> :-(
12:31:11 <wilx> Hm, GHC(i) doesn't read UTF16 files?
12:35:29 <SamB> why should it?
12:35:33 <SamB> what good are they?
12:35:41 <SamB> they seem mostly good for breaking things
12:36:31 <wilx> Why shouldn't it? :)
12:36:43 <wilx> Especially when I saved it with BOM.
12:38:13 <wilx> Or UCS4...
12:38:29 * Heffalump still wants to know where to get encodeUTF8 from
12:46:47 <frederik> shouldn't there be a way to get a stack trace in haskell?
12:47:01 <Heffalump> lazy evaluation makes it very hard
12:47:22 <frederik> it might make it very inefficient, but i think it should be a compiler option
12:47:24 <Heffalump> Robert Ennals made a debugger based on his optimistic evaluation work, but since that never got merged into GHC I think it's dead now.
12:47:36 <frederik> or a runtime option
12:47:48 <Heffalump> well, feel free to implement it ;-)
12:48:06 <shapr> Could you use debug.trace?
12:48:06 <frederik> that's a lame answer
12:48:14 <frederik> another lame answer
12:48:17 <frederik> j/k
12:48:18 <kosmikus> you can use hat
12:48:23 <frederik> what is hat?
12:48:26 <Heffalump> I've already explained why it's hard to implement.
12:48:33 <kosmikus> haskell.org/hat
12:48:48 <wilx> Heffalump, isn't there something UTF8 related in the Pugs sources?
12:48:59 <frederik> shapr: i could use debug.trace, but it's a pain to annotate everything
12:49:00 <Heffalump> Hat gives you a redex trail not a stack trace, right?
12:49:11 <frederik> oh, that would be nice
12:49:28 <Heffalump> wilx: I don't know. But that sounds promising.
12:49:29 <kosmikus> I think you can get a "virtual stack trace" as well
12:49:53 <kosmikus> of course it's not a real stack trace
12:49:59 <frederik> it would be nice to have actual code locations for when there is a pattern match or related error, like when you apply 'head' to an empty list
12:50:10 <Heffalump> yeah, that'd be very useful
12:50:22 <Heffalump> I think jhc did some experiments along those lines. Has anything happened with it lately?
12:50:29 <frederik> but you kind of need a stack trace since it's usually a caller that has the error
12:50:35 <frederik> dunno

12:55:28 <shapr> boegel: Slowly making progress.
12:55:42 * stepcut is slowly making progress on his unix pipes code
12:56:04 <stepcut> check return codes in a non-blocking manner is proving tricky
12:57:31 <Heffalump> can't you just use a different thread?
12:57:31 <stepcut> s/check/checking/
12:58:25 <stepcut> Heffalump: well, I want to avoid using threads, because I don't know if OS threads will be available or not
12:58:58 <stepcut> getProcessStatus has an option to not block -- so that is not an issue
12:59:11 <jlouis> shapr: hows code? And where is it?
13:00:18 <lispy> OT question: how safe is sw raid0 with linux?
13:00:30 <lispy> if a drive crashes you're screwed right?
13:00:34 <stepcut> but, I am trying to write a function that will check that all the processes in a list of pid's exitted successfully
13:01:09 <lispy> @hoogle all
13:01:35 <lispy> @vixen hello?
13:01:51 <stepcut> if getProcessStatus suceeds in get the exit status of a process, then that process is removed from the process table -- so I also have to remove it from my list of child pids
13:02:27 <stepcut> so, basically, you need to pass a list of pids to the function, and the function returns a list of pids that are still alive
13:02:46 <stepcut> if you accidently use the same list twice, you get bad answers...
13:03:16 <lispy> stepcut: so no referential transparency?
13:03:18 <stepcut> so I think I need to use some sort of State monad + IO to make sure the user does not accidently use the same list twice
13:03:50 * stepcut has to run to lunch, bbiab
13:03:52 <Heffalump> you could do it just with a state monad and a bit of hiding
13:04:11 <stepcut> Heffalump: if you are around when I get back, lets talk
13:04:24 <Heffalump> 'k
13:04:57 <CosmicRay> lispy: regarding sw raid in linux...
13:05:10 <Heffalump> we used to do that
13:05:11 <CosmicRay> lispy: it is obviously not as nice as hw raid, but that's not really linux's fault.
13:05:36 <CosmicRay> lispy: if you have a disk that is just having bad sectors, in theory it should be able to deal with that just fine (I say "in theory" because I've never personally observed it in that situation)
13:05:37 <lispy> CosmicRay: is it evil to have your system partition on raid?
13:05:37 <boegel> shapr: I'd love to try it out... I received my workstation today, and have to do a lot of paper reading nowadays, and maybe it could help me organize stuff
13:05:39 <Heffalump> we've now switched to SCSI + hw raid. Which is nice :-)
13:06:07 <CosmicRay> lispy: if you do something like have a short on your SCSI chain or the drive doesn't even power up, things could get worse because hw controllers don't deal with these things well.
13:06:19 <CosmicRay> lispy: you will almost certainly not be able to "hot swap" sw raid devices.
13:06:43 <CosmicRay> lispy: it is best to have /boot *not* on sw raid, and have the relevant hw and raid drivers compiled directly into the kernel.
13:06:52 <CosmicRay> lispy: it is probably easiest to also have / not on sw raid
13:07:04 <CosmicRay> lispy: these are both typically small (<500MB) so it's not that big a problem
13:07:18 <CosmicRay> lispy: there are ways around this, I know, but I don't know what they are from memory
13:07:43 <Heffalump> initrd presumably
13:07:56 <lispy> CosmicRay: so the server i'm cosidering is 1U so it only has space for 2 drives.  Do you think it will just be a headache to use sw raid?
13:08:10 <pejo> CosmicRay, uah. Not that I know anything about Linux and RAID but a mirrored root and swap is normally quite nice to have.
13:08:20 <paolo> initramfs is the future! :-)
13:08:24 <CosmicRay> lispy: I would say that if you are using raid for reliability, as opposed to space, then it is worth your while to get hardware raid.
13:08:41 <Heffalump> lispy: the machine I'm IRCing from now used to be a 1U server with software RAID
13:08:54 <Heffalump> worked fine, but in the end IDE couldn't cope with the load of running a freedb mirror
13:08:56 <CosmicRay> lispy: if reliability is your goal then do yourself a favor and go with hardware raid.
13:09:23 <Heffalump> hardware raid can cause some driver issues, we had to use a non-Debian kernel with our new hardware raid machine because it's only supported in recent 2.6
13:09:35 <lispy> CosmicRay: okay, afaik i'd have to go with a different server to do hw raid
13:09:54 <CosmicRay> lispy: well if there are other benefits of this server, then go with sw raid, it's not *that* much worse
13:09:58 <CosmicRay> but hw raid is generally better
13:10:13 <lispy> i'm still trying to figure out how I will do backups
13:10:19 <CosmicRay> are you thinking of just doing mirroring then, with only the 2 drives?
13:10:28 <lispy> my current system is an external usb drive, but I don't think that would fly in the server room
13:10:38 <lispy> CosmicRay: stripping actually
13:10:46 <lispy> CosmicRay: or maybe 0+1
13:10:49 <CosmicRay> oh, so you aren't even doing this for reliability, just for space then?
13:11:17 <Heffalump> are you traffic-limited in the server room?
13:11:31 <lispy> maybe i don't understand raid0.  My goal was performance, with the hope of having a backup external to the server
13:11:51 <lispy> Heffalump: not sure ;)
13:12:30 <CosmicRay> ok, then raid0 is fine for that.
13:12:57 <Heffalump> use rsync for backups, then?
13:13:00 <CosmicRay> raid0 is just striping.  It gives you 2n capacity, where n is the capacity of a drive in the system
13:13:04 <Heffalump> (to some other system elsewhere)
13:13:24 <CosmicRay> it gives you no redundancy or reliability benefits whatsoever.  If either drive dies, the entire thing dies.
13:13:32 <lispy> Heffalump: well, I would be bandwidth limited for getting the data out of the datacenter, so unless I had another server in the datacenter rsync would break the bank ;)
13:13:37 <CosmicRay> but otoh, using sw raid in that situation is no worse than hw raid
13:13:59 <jlouis> @source
13:14:07 <jlouis> @version
13:14:08 <jlouis> then
13:14:10 <lispy> CosmicRay: that's good to know
13:14:36 <Heffalump> ah, that was what I meant about being traffic limited
13:14:40 <jlouis> can't even remember how to extract the CVS repo
13:14:41 <lispy> they offer $30/month for every 100gb to do daily backups for you, but I don't like that idea
13:14:44 <CosmicRay> there is of course a slightly added configuration complexity with sw raid, as you've alluded to (the booting issue), but that's about it
13:14:46 <Heffalump> our hosting counts traffic at the switch, as it happens
13:14:47 <jlouis> ehm darcs repo even
13:15:00 <CosmicRay> lispy: tape backups?
13:15:01 <jlouis> anybody remember the lambdabot repo url?
13:15:12 <paolo> @version
13:15:21 <paolo> erhm..
13:15:27 <lispy> CosmicRay: i'm not sure what they use
13:15:28 <Heffalump> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
13:15:39 <Heffalump> is what it was a few months ago, and I have no reason to believe it has changed
13:15:42 <jlouis> thanks Heffalump
13:15:52 <lispy> my current server is in my house, with an external USB drive plugged in and crontab to do a weekly backup
13:16:03 <CosmicRay> lispy: the advantage of tape is that it is cheap enough per-gb that you can keep full backups of a few weeks' worth of history for a reasonable cost.  they are also portable and can thus be transported to offsite locations easy
13:16:11 <Heffalump> you might find rsyncing important stuff is fairly cheap and good enough.
13:16:20 <Heffalump> after all, only stuff that has actually changed will be transfered
13:16:22 <CosmicRay> for anything important and of any large size, tape is really the best way to go.
13:16:31 <CosmicRay> at home, I use rdiff-backup, sorta like rsync but it preserves history.
13:16:34 <Heffalump> that's roughly what we do and I haven't noticed it using huge amounts of bandwidth yet
13:16:45 <Heffalump> CosmicRay: you assume he has an easy way to change tapes in the data centre
13:16:50 <CosmicRay> but that's not really practical when you want to keep a couple weeks' worth of history across 400GB of data
13:16:53 <lispy> Heffalump: that's a good point
13:17:06 <Heffalump> we have a 100GB/month traffic limit and we're still nowhere near it
13:17:08 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: yes, I am aware of that.
13:17:26 <lispy> i don't mind my current simple backup system (it basically just efficiently clones the drive)
13:17:27 <CosmicRay> I don't really know what sort of data he's storing, how important it is, how important history is, or how important restore times are.
13:17:42 <lispy> Heffalump: i'm looking at more like 10GB/month
13:18:05 <Heffalump> well, how much do you expect things to change?
13:18:10 <lispy> CosmicRay: most just personal data and some mysql dbs
13:18:20 <lispy> Heffalump: not a lot i guess
13:18:54 <CosmicRay> lispy: well, how important is it to you that these things not go down?  How important is it to you to be able to pull a version from 3 days ago, before that "delete from" that you just now realized deleted something important?
13:19:35 <lispy> CosmicRay: i use darcs for all my important data, so as long as I have my darcs history backed up I'm okay ;)
13:19:55 <CosmicRay> ah ok then.
13:20:00 <CosmicRay> in that case tape isn't that vital
13:20:01 <lispy> the backup is really just so that if the drive fails i at least one copy
13:20:30 <lispy> using rsynch maybe the way to go
13:20:37 <lispy> especially if i'm running it once a week
13:20:51 <lispy> i'd prefer to have my backup in the datacenter since it's safer than my home
13:21:03 <lispy> but that's not really a big deal either
13:21:34 <Heffalump> you surely don't want it in the same place as the originals
13:22:28 <lispy> i'm not that worried about external catastrophe, i'm more worried about drive failure
13:22:48 <Heffalump> what makes the datacentre safer than your home, then?
13:22:59 <lispy> powersurges
13:23:34 <lispy> I do use surgeprotectors and UPSs but those aren't as good as the datacenter's protections
13:24:05 <Heffalump> you're still committing yourself to a single point of failure
13:24:11 <lispy> indeed
13:24:18 <Heffalump> it's highly unlikely that your house will lose the data at the same time as the datacentre does
13:24:26 <lispy> but i keep a copy of the darcs data on my laptop
13:24:32 <Heffalump> whereas a fire, or a power surge that overwhelms their protection, will break both
13:24:40 <Heffalump> if you keep the backups there, that is
13:27:16 <monochrom> It is unlikely that gmail goes down.  you should use that.  :)
13:27:30 <lispy> heh
13:27:44 <lispy> there is a gmailfs
13:28:28 <paolo> I usually encrypt them and put on friend's server
13:28:47 <lispy> paolo: your backups?
13:29:01 <paolo> Yup
13:30:16 <wilx> Hmm...are there any generic fold/map functions?
13:30:43 <wilx> It seems odd that I would need to define my own fold/map for my STList...
13:30:44 <paolo> More generic than fold/map ?
13:30:49 <paolo> wilx, fmap I think
13:30:57 <monochrom> Data.Generics has something
13:31:11 <paolo> OK, was wrong :-)
13:31:18 <lispy> generic in which sense?  That they traverse something besides lists?
13:31:24 <wilx> Yes.
13:31:36 <lispy> yeah, that's something OO is good at
13:31:48 <lispy> iterators and enumerators
13:32:01 <Philippa> funny, IME OO's fucking *awful* at it
13:32:03 <monochrom> map can be defined in terms of fold and your constructors.  You just need fold.  Data.Generics may even alleviate fold.
13:32:26 <monochrom> Haha, don't make me laugh, you have you write your own iterators.
13:32:32 <Philippa> quite
13:32:33 <wilx> Data.Generic is so very...opaque to me.
13:32:47 <Philippa> and writing a particular style of traversal over a class of iterators? *yuck*
13:34:09 <Philippa> iterators are just a patch for what in haskell is simply having the damn value :-)
13:35:56 <lispy> iterators encapsulate 'next' element, so if you define for your datastructure what that means then you can now map
13:37:10 <Philippa> that's one particular flavour of iterator
13:37:37 <lispy> that's the only flavour that i'm aware of ;)
13:37:47 <wilx> I was/am pondering iterators too because I don't to expose the nodes of the list...
13:38:03 <Philippa> they generalise to any flavour of navigation you have in mind
13:38:09 <monochrom> A functional alternative to iterators is http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ctcs99.pdf
13:38:26 <lispy> wilx: seems like you could create a type class pretty easily
13:38:32 <Philippa> the 'next/previous' sort doesn't make sense except as a way to provide map on a lot of structures, too
13:38:59 <lispy> Philippa: well, providing map on a lot of structures is really nice, IMHO
13:39:09 <paolo> Other examples: tree-travelsal iterator ?
13:39:36 <paolo> But fmap is enough there... Philippa what are you thinking of?
13:40:19 <lispy> paolo: do you have a tutorial or something that explains how to use fmap to traverse a tree?  That could be a useful pattern/trick to know
13:40:51 <Philippa> paolo: tree-traversal's a good one, yeah - you end up with eg left, right and up, or next/prev/down/up if you want to go that way
13:41:04 <paolo> lispy, I think I read it on the gentle... or on the wiki.  i.e. write a Functor instance for the classical binary tree datatype.
13:41:06 <Philippa> lispy: define an fmap instance that hits every node in the tree
13:41:09 <monochrom> data BTree a = Nil | Bin (BTree a) (BTree a)
13:41:11 <Philippa> yeah
13:41:16 <Philippa> fmap is just generalised map
13:41:23 <Philippa> (but you have to implement it)
13:41:27 <monochrom> btmap Nil = Nil
13:41:43 <monochrom> btmap (Bin x y) = Bin (btmap x) (btmap y)
13:41:43 <paolo> It was illuminating, shapr introductionary course at my haskell-kindergarden days.
13:42:18 <monochrom> instance Functor BTree where fmap = btmap
13:42:27 <lispy> ah, okay
13:42:33 <lispy> what about fold?
13:42:37 <Philippa> paolo: it's possible to derive fmap, an available-on-all-types derived fmap would be good
13:42:48 <lispy> is there a way to get that from this functor definition for free?
13:42:59 <monochrom> btfold c f g Nil = c
13:43:00 <Philippa> you don't get fold from functor, you get it from the datatype itself
13:43:10 <Philippa> it's just replacing each constructor with a function
13:43:19 <Philippa> much as fold replaces cons with one thing and nil with another
13:43:32 <Philippa> (strictly speaking you get /a/ fold, and then we start talking about traversal strategies and stuff)
13:43:36 <monochrom> btfold c f g (Bin x y) = Bin (btfold c f g (f x)) (btfold c f g (g y))
13:43:42 <paolo> Philippa, *morphism ?
13:44:09 <monochrom> Hmm it looks wrong.
13:44:17 <lispy> i think you have an extra Bin
13:44:37 <monochrom> Remind me what foldr looks like.
13:44:51 <lispy> @source oh yeah lambabot is gone....
13:45:00 <Philippa> paolo: cata, yeah
13:45:04 <mauke> @type foldr
13:45:27 <paolo> Philippa, I always wondered what that word meant - is that explanable in give short time? :-)
13:45:40 <monochrom> btfold c f Nil = c; btfold c f (Bin x y) = f (btfold c f x) (btfold c f y)
13:45:45 <monochrom> This one should be right.
13:46:10 <monochrom> It has been a while since I could just calculate it from the definitions and theorems of catamorphisms.
13:46:28 <Philippa> paolo: "generalisation of fold to any appropriate structure", AFAICT
13:46:38 <Philippa> close enough for haskell, anyway
13:47:35 <monochrom> Hahahaha my btmap was wrong too.
13:47:54 <monochrom> Hahahahahahaha my BTree is useless to begin with.
13:48:12 <monochrom> data BTree a = Leaf a | Bin (BTree a) (BTree a)
13:48:19 <monochrom> (Do you see what's wrong before? :D )
13:49:00 <lispy> monochrom: who needs to store anything in the tree ;)
13:49:20 <mauke> data BTree a = Leaf | Bin a (BTree a) (BTree a)
13:49:40 <monochrom> OK mauke's is much more interesting.
13:49:43 <paolo> The Leafs were unproductive :-P
13:49:59 <monochrom> We'll go with mauke's.
13:50:09 <monochrom> btmap f Leaf = Leaf
13:50:25 <Philippa> monochrom: "leafy" binary trees have their uses
13:50:36 <monochrom> btmap f (Bin i x y) = Bin (f i) (btmap f x) (btmap f y)
13:50:49 <Philippa> though different data on leaf and branch more so (leafy BSP trees, for example)
13:51:24 <monochrom> Yeah but I want an illuminating example, rather than just a correct example.
13:51:47 <paolo> Philippa, data BSPTree a b = Leaf a | Node (BSPTree a b) b (BSPTree a b) ?
13:52:38 <boegel> yo Itkovian
13:53:04 <Itkovian> hi boegel
13:54:13 <monochrom> btfold c f Leaf = c
13:54:16 <monochrom> btfold c f (Bin i x y) = f i (btfold c f x) (btfold c f y)
13:54:36 <Philippa> paolo: that's too generic - BSP = Binary Space Partition, the branches have a (hyper)plane attached
13:54:52 <SyntaxNinja> apparently PUGS was quite a buzz at oscon
13:54:55 <paolo> Philippa, sorry, what does it mean?
13:55:00 <monochrom> In fact btmap f = btfold Leaf (\i x y -> Bin (f i) x y)
13:55:21 <monochrom> In this sense btfold owns btmap
13:55:32 <Philippa> paolo: a binary space partition tree partitions space (duh) with each branch - there's a (hyper)plane, and the left child's the space on the LHS of the plane and so forth
13:56:05 <monochrom> But traversal monad owns btfold
13:56:21 <Philippa> you could define the quadrants of a rectangle with a 3-node BSP tree, for example
13:56:23 <paolo> Philippa, maybe the corresponding Haskell type could help understanding...
13:56:39 <Philippa> instantiate your b with a Plane or HyperPlane type
13:58:07 <paolo> Philippa, I'm lost, thanks anyway.
13:58:33 <Philippa> data LeafyBSPTree a = Leaf a | Branch Plane (LeafyBSPTree a) (LeafyBSPTree a)
13:58:52 <CosmicRay> time to afk for awhile, cyall later
13:58:57 <Philippa> seeya
13:59:02 <lispy> Philippa: what are typcial instantiations of a?
14:00:47 <Philippa> [GameEntity], [RenderGeometry], stuff like that
14:02:05 <lispy> oh, okay, cool.  That helps ;)
14:04:19 <Philippa> well, that's typical where I see them. You've got a neatly partitioned space in however many dimensions is useful to you, in one dimension you're halfway through a quicksort implementation ;-)
14:06:09 <paolo> Between the entertaining and @vixen, from my point of view :-)
14:23:11 * paolo NP: The Doors - Strange Days
14:24:48 <jlouis> do you guys think dons takes lambdabot patches?
14:25:30 <jlouis> or is he on vacation?
14:26:29 <lispy> jlouis: he does take patches
14:26:35 <lispy> dons is very good about accepting patches
14:26:50 <lispy> just darcs send and he'll get it
14:34:18 <Heffalump> what'd you do to it, OOI?
14:39:14 <wilx> Hahaha, this sucks. The interesting stuff that is supposed to be in chapter 10 of YAHT is not finished yet :)
14:40:50 <lament> awww
14:43:40 <lament> wow, wtf, you need to give your email address to get YAHT now?
14:43:46 <lament> that makes no sense
14:44:09 <wilx> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/tutorial.pdf
14:44:27 <SyntaxNinja> it's always been like that
14:44:54 <fnord123> is someone says ian or isaac in a haskell related email, who do they mean? i.e. I know who Kenny is in Lisp related emails
14:45:11 <fnord123> apparenly "isaac" is the horses mouth wrt cabal
14:45:12 <lament> strange
14:45:14 <Heffalump> got a URL?
14:45:16 <lament> i remember downloading it
14:45:16 <SyntaxNinja> <-- isaac
14:45:19 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo is ian
14:45:22 <lament> without any forms
14:45:23 <Heffalump> Isaac is Isaac^U that guy
14:45:56 <SyntaxNinja> <--- more like horses ass, but whatever ;)
14:46:01 * shapr snickers
14:46:03 <Heffalump> Ian / Igloo is probably the second biggest contributor to darcs after David Roundy, and also the Debian ghc maintainer
14:46:11 <Heffalump> s/probably //
14:46:39 <shapr> fnord123: And you have the Simons, Simon Peyton-Jones and Simon Marlow, they're the people behind GHC at the moment.
14:46:48 <shapr> fnord123: Any other Haskell people questions?
14:47:13 <wilx> And there is me.
14:47:14 <Heffalump> s/ at the moment// :-)
14:47:14 <shapr> Lucky for me, not many programmers named Shae.
14:47:19 <wilx> Totally clueless. :D
14:47:21 <Philippa> nor many Philippas
14:47:30 <shapr> Heffalump: Well, I've left out all the past contributors to GHC.
14:47:49 <Heffalump> I expect there are still people doing the odd thing to it
14:48:00 <Heffalump> but the Simons have been the main authors pretty much right through
14:48:08 <fnord123> i was talking to David through email and I was asking about Cabal and darcs and he said darcs predates cabal and he wasn't too interested in porting darcs to a package system even though he has a lot of interest in lots of parts being modularised
14:48:22 <fnord123> and he claimed there might be too much C to make it easy
14:48:32 <fnord123> so I need to talk to Isaac about that.
14:48:33 <Heffalump> this whole freenode n= bollocks is really getting on my nerves.
14:48:36 <stepcut> Heffalump: so, tell me more about this state monad and a bit of hiding?
14:48:45 <fnord123> and Ian is keen on swiping FastPackedString
14:48:47 <SyntaxNinja> it's true that darcs might be too complex for cabal, but I'm not sure. the amount of C doesn't matter, but the complexity would.
14:48:51 <Heffalump> stepcut: ah, you're back, I was just wondering if you were coming back :-)
14:48:56 <Heffalump> can you describe the problem again?
14:49:05 <stepcut> :)
14:49:09 <stepcut> long lunch
14:49:13 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: does cabal cope with external FFI libraries ok?
14:49:14 * shapr laughs
14:49:21 <Heffalump> ISTR giving up on it a little while ago because it didn't seem to.
14:49:29 <stepcut> Well, I want to fork of a bunch of child process, and then have a non-blocking way to check and see if they have all finished running yet
14:49:38 <shapr> fnord123: I'm keen on swiping FastPackedString also.
14:49:49 <SyntaxNinja> darcs may or may not predate cabal. we could debate that ;)
14:50:00 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: yeah
14:50:09 <Heffalump> ok, I should have another go then.
14:50:10 <fnord123> "I just haven't bothered learning Cabal.  Darcs significantly predates
14:50:10 <fnord123> Cabal, and I haven't seen much reason to learn it."
14:50:22 <fnord123> I'm not trying to start trouble. :)
14:50:24 <SyntaxNinja> hehe
14:50:27 <maihem> There's something that's come up before, but I can't remember the reason... foldr acts like a recursion (it stores a thunk for each element of the list) for it to run in reverse, but I expected foldl to act like iteration (as it can complete its calculations and discard the results for each element of the list). However, foldl keeps giving a stack overflow. How come? Is it possible to write something like foldl that descr
14:50:27 <maihem> ibes iteration-ness?
14:50:32 <SyntaxNinja> nah, I love darcs. I maintain darcs in debian.
14:51:07 <fnord123> And david, if you're reading #haskell logs, I'm just sharing your comments because I'm  interested in community efforts and er because you said to ask Ian and Isaac..
14:51:26 <stepcut> I can use getProcessStatus to check the return status in a non-blocking way, but once it succeeds in checking the status of a child process (ie, the child has finally finished), the child pid will be removed from the process table
14:51:28 <shapr> If (many?) pieces of darcs get factored out into libs, Cabal support will be a big benefit.
14:51:35 <SyntaxNinja> unless you are interested in code reuse, or hackage or other layered tools, you don't need cabal right now. I predict some day darcs will use cabal :)
14:51:45 <stepcut> so, I will starting getting errors if I try to call getProcessStatus on the child anymore
14:51:53 <SyntaxNinja> but if david isn't keen on splitting stuff out into libraries, then he doesn't need to learn it. if someone does want to do so, they should learn cabal.
14:51:58 <Heffalump> stepcut: ah, right.
14:52:05 <shapr> fnord123: Don't worry, very few Haskellers assume malice (and those who do, don't stay on #haskell for long)
14:52:17 <fnord123> I've already refactored it
14:52:21 <SyntaxNinja> because shapr malliciously kicks them off! (I assume)
14:52:27 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: Correct.
14:52:29 <Heffalump> presumably you only expect runtime safety? You don't want a static guarantee that a program will never try to reuse a dead pid?
14:52:29 <Igloo> fnord123: What did he say to ask Ian and Isaac?
14:52:33 <fnord123> but I didn't move files with darcs commands so I think the repository has no idea what ive done
14:52:37 <stepcut> so, I can make some function that takes a list of child process and returns either 'The all succeeded', 'This one failed', or 'These are still running'
14:53:04 <fnord123> ask ian about his interest in modularising fastpackedstring and ask isaac about cabalising darka darka
14:53:08 <SyntaxNinja> I could understand if David doesn't want a mixed cabal + Make build system; but they could coexist without getting in his way
14:53:14 <stepcut> but that requires the caller to be careful about using the same pid list twice
14:53:29 <Igloo> Ah. I need to get around to writing a relicensing mail to various people
14:53:39 <shapr> stepcut: What about giving the caller a function that returns the current pid list, and not a list?
14:53:41 * SyntaxNinja relicences igloo
14:53:55 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: do you have specific questions about cabal?
14:54:14 <Heffalump> the caller may need to subset it, or maintain different pid lists
14:54:35 <shapr> What about a deadPid filter?
14:54:46 <Heffalump> an easy runtime solution would be to replace each pid with a really unique id, and maintain a table of those unique ids in the state monad
14:54:54 <shapr> stepcut: What's the problem with using the same pid list twice?
14:55:00 <Heffalump> then you can just return Invalid or something to callers that try to use a dead pdi
14:55:03 <Heffalump> s/pdi/pid/
14:55:07 <Heffalump> shapr: he already explained that
14:55:13 * shapr reads back
14:55:17 <stepcut> shapr: because after you call getProcessStatus, some pids may no longer exist
14:55:21 <fnord123> SyntaxNinja: not at the moment
14:55:37 <paolo> Is State Monad content mutable?
14:55:41 <fnord123> apart from um, if youve looked at darcs, what are the major difficulties in porting it to a cabal build system?
14:55:43 <Heffalump> yes, that's the point of it
14:55:44 <fnord123> \
14:56:07 <paolo> It ask "ask" as the Reader one?
14:56:15 <paolo> "It has" even
14:56:18 <shapr> stepcut: What about maintaining a status table, and still running can be thunks somehow?
14:56:20 <Heffalump> stepcut: have I provided enough explanation of my solution?
14:56:42 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: I don't know of any difficulties offhand. the questions would be, what bizzare things does the makefile do :)
14:57:00 <stepcut> Heffalump: yeah, I am thinking of doing something with a state monad -- I just suspect it will make the code ugly because you will already be inside an IO monad
14:57:01 <SyntaxNinja> if autoconf or whatever does a lot of stuff, that _might_ be tricky, but then agian maybe not since cabal can use autoconf
14:57:15 <Heffalump> stepcut: well, you could use a monad transformer
14:57:21 <stepcut> >StateT ?
14:57:26 <Heffalump> yeah
14:57:27 <fnord123> he runs some scripts for haskell pre preprocessing.
14:57:32 <fnord123> preprocessing the lhs
14:57:48 <Heffalump> cabal can do that ok
14:58:00 <stepcut> Heffalump: yeah, I am looking into that, though it seems like the caller will still need lots of 'lift' for all the IO
14:58:04 <fnord123> and there;s a .configure
14:58:21 <Heffalump> stepcut: yeah, if you haven't already gone through that pain for other reasons, it's not all that nice
14:58:27 <SyntaxNinja> what is DCAVINCIHOME and what dcoes it have to dco w/ ghcprof?
14:58:28 <wilx> @wiki
14:58:36 <Heffalump> if you don't mind passing around a global IORef token, you can avoid that
14:58:42 <stepcut> Heffalump: unfortunately, check the status of the children is an infrequent thing, compared to the other amount of io that is going on
14:58:45 <Heffalump> (i.e. store the state in the IORef instead)
14:58:55 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: that's fine. look at the 'more complex packages' section of the manual
14:58:58 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: I think that's because GHC used to have support for some DaVinci visualization thingy.
14:59:07 <fnord123> wibble
14:59:24 <Heffalump> does it not still have it?
14:59:44 <stepcut> Heffalump: I thought about that too, but it is not a great solution either -- as a I may have many different groups of children whose return status I am waiting for
15:00:02 <Heffalump> well, it depends if you can make the IORef easily available where needed.
15:00:13 <Heffalump> It doesn't even need to be a single global one, if the sets of processes will be disjoint
15:00:19 <shapr> Heffalump: I was unable to get a version of the DaVinci software to work with it last time I tried. (several years ago)
15:00:25 <Heffalump> you _could_ go the unsafePerformIO route
15:02:20 <stepcut> Heffalump: ok.. I will also look into IOrefs ... I am not against using them in this case ... The readability of the code that will be calling my library functions is quite important
15:02:36 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: fwiw, I would guess that david won't want to use cabal for all of darcs because he doesn't want to scare away non-haskell users.
15:02:40 <stepcut> so, I would rather use IOrefs, than make people write ugly code with monad transformers and other crazyness
15:02:43 <Heffalump> the unsafePerformIO solution is the IORef solution taken a step further
15:02:53 <stepcut> really, this would all be a lot cleaner if haskell had uniqueness type ;)
15:03:02 <Heffalump> you use an IORef, and you make it available as a really global variable using unsafePerformIO to create it
15:03:15 <shapr> You've got the Uniqueness source in ghc6
15:03:20 <Heffalump> you'd still have to thread the state around to do it
15:03:31 <fnord123> christ
15:03:33 <Heffalump> so uniqueness types would be no less ugly than the IORef solution
15:04:15 <wilx> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview
15:04:28 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: that's just a guess! but you might check with him... I suggest the "coexist" option for now.
15:04:34 <fnord123> make eats.
15:04:37 <wilx> This is my STList. I am trying to define fmap. But I keep failing...
15:04:46 <SyntaxNinja> cabal is quickly becomming more sophisticated, and we would gladly accept patches that make building darcs possible.
15:04:52 <SyntaxNinja> (if it's not already)
15:05:03 <stepcut> Heffalump: yeah -- I think I just need a mutable list ... and I will already be in the IO monad when I am doing this, so it is not going to force IO where it would not otherwise be needed
15:05:19 <Heffalump> yeah. The problem is making the IORef you keep it in available
15:05:30 <fnord123> I'm just doing this to canabalise some parts for use in yi
15:05:35 <shapr> w00
15:05:55 <fnord123> with no one on my payroll it's quite annoying that i can't just tell people what to do :(
15:05:57 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: does ghcprof from the 6.2 package require davinci?
15:06:14 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja: I get 'Distribution/Compat/Exception.hs:14: #endif without #if' when I try to build cabal from darcs
15:06:23 <stepcut> Heffalump: Well, I will look into it -- I don't know if I need the IORef to be globally available
15:06:43 <Heffalump> well, you need to pass it between library calls somehow
15:06:54 <SyntaxNinja> kosmikus: ghc version?
15:07:08 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja: 6.4.1.20050809
15:07:09 * Igloo doesn't know what ghcprof is
15:07:32 <SyntaxNinja> oh hm.
15:07:38 <stepcut> Heffalump: I can't answer that right now, I have to first read about IORefs -- never had a need for them until now :)
15:08:00 <Heffalump> it wasn't a question, it was a statement of fact :-)
15:08:03 <SyntaxNinja> I thought it was part of the ghc6prof package, but it's not.
15:08:08 <Heffalump> @type newIORef
15:08:27 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja: to me, it looks as if it's right, there are two #endif's in there, but only one #if
15:09:03 <Heffalump> the operations you need are newIORef, readIORef and writeIORef
15:09:20 <SyntaxNinja> kosmikus: huh? I see to ifdefs and to endifs
15:09:35 * Heffalump suggests you both run darcs check :-)
15:10:01 <shapr> I like darcs check --complete
15:10:07 <Heffalump> what's that do?
15:10:24 <Heffalump> or rather, what does darcs check without it not do?
15:10:25 <stepcut> Heffalump: I don't mind the user having to explicitly pass something around...
15:10:26 <kosmikus> says it's consistent
15:10:27 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: it wfm, so that wouldn't help :P
15:10:31 <SyntaxNinja> I have 6.4.0
15:10:47 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: you could have a corrupted repo that doesn't agree with the patches in it
15:10:55 <kosmikus> and it's a fresh get
15:11:01 <Heffalump> in that case, you might see it working, but replaying the patch sequence would give other people a broken version
15:11:28 <Heffalump> stepcut: in that case, you could use an IORef without any problems
15:12:46 <paolo> Neat, haskell-unsafe installs 6.4.1!
15:13:40 <Igloo> No, it has 6.4.1~20050801
15:13:59 <shapr> Does that include smp support?
15:14:42 <paolo> Ok, a snapshot of it, I used to have 6.4.
15:14:57 <Heffalump> when will 6.4.1 release?
15:15:30 <SyntaxNinja> well, it still _looks_ correct. do you see any reason for this error, Heffalump?
15:15:31 <Heffalump> presumably smp stuff is destined for 6.6, not 6.4.1?
15:15:39 * shapr dunno
15:15:40 <Igloo> Any minute now, I hope. I think we're in the second week of "1 or 2 weeks" and I don't remember any significant bugs being reported
15:15:59 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: you need to check that you both have the same sets of patches, that neither of you has local changes, and that darcs check for both of you returns no problems.
15:16:08 * shapr looks forward to Haskell Studio 7
15:16:19 <kosmikus> I'm just trying to do another get on another machine with another darcs version
15:16:24 <Heffalump> you can do the first with darcs changes --xml | sort
15:16:28 <Heffalump> (and comparing the outputs)
15:16:40 <Heffalump> [Igloo may contradict me about that idea, which I only just made up]
15:16:55 <Heffalump> you can check for local changes in any of the obvious ways, e.g. darcs whatsnew or darcs revert
15:17:39 <kosmikus> interesting, that worked
15:17:41 <Heffalump> another option for checking for identical sets of patches would be for to verify that a push and a pull from one repo to the other offers no patches
15:17:47 <kosmikus> so could it be a bug in darcs?
15:17:53 <Heffalump> sounds very possible :-)
15:18:41 <Igloo> What's buggy and what's not?
15:18:42 <kosmikus> that'd be in darcs-1.0.4pre2, then
15:18:49 <Igloo> What's the repo?
15:18:49 <kosmikus> 1.0.2 is not
15:19:02 <kosmikus> http://cvs.haskell.org/darcs/cabal
15:19:11 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: I did a fresh get and it builds fine w/ 6.4
15:19:12 <kosmikus> but first I'll check if I can reproduce it myself
15:20:26 <paolo> What is libgmp3?
15:20:59 <Heffalump> gnu multiprecision library
15:21:09 <Heffalump> ghc compiled programs use it to implement Integer
15:21:21 <paolo> Hmm.  Why it does block installing darcs?  :-(
15:21:30 <Heffalump> in ghc unstable?
15:21:35 <Heffalump> IM in Debian unstable?
15:21:44 <paolo> Ubuntu unstable
15:21:49 <Heffalump> If so, because the library situation is fucked there atm. Try pulling libgmp3 back down to the etch version.
15:21:53 <Heffalump> ah, no idea then.
15:22:00 <paolo> Package: libgmp3
15:22:00 <paolo> State: not a real package
15:22:50 <SyntaxNinja> kosmikus: sorry I can't follow too closely. please get my attention if there's a cabal build bug
15:24:39 <Igloo> Bah. Looks like a darcs bug. *mutters about the hunk format*
15:25:00 <SyntaxNinja> ha!! hear that, fnord123!
15:25:17 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja: no cabal bug
15:25:27 <kosmikus> Igloo: yes, I can reproduce it with darcs-1.0.4pre2
15:25:32 * SyntaxNinja chalks one up against his imagined adversary, David in the future imagined event of david trolling through #haskell logs looking for his name.
15:26:16 <Philippa> for the purposes of the logs I'm asexual and thus not worth ASLing. kthxbye
15:26:39 <Heffalump> Philippa: you what?
15:26:42 <SyntaxNinja> haha
15:27:36 <kosmikus> Igloo: anything I should do, or can you handle it from here?
15:28:06 <fnord123> no no we want http://cvs.haskell.org/darcs/darcs/darcs.cabal
15:28:25 <SyntaxNinja> we should have a rivalry between darcs and cabal. it would make no sense.
15:28:41 <Igloo> kosmikus: I'll write a mail to the list about it in a minute
15:28:49 <kosmikus> ok, ta
15:28:54 <SyntaxNinja> cabal is the way! no! darcs is the way!
15:28:59 <fnord123> oh lord what have i started
15:29:12 <Igloo> SyntaxNinja: But in Debian, both sides get to blame you, right?
15:29:30 * Igloo is all for rivalries in which SyntaxNinja loses either way  :-)
15:30:21 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: I live in portland, not Vancouver
15:30:47 <Heffalump> lol
15:31:57 <SyntaxNinja> fnord123: I don't think david would want to host on cvs.h.o also :)
15:33:02 * Heffalump wonders if this stupid nickname/hostname stuff will help persuade people to move #haskell to oftc
15:33:21 <SyntaxNinja> we should all switch to jabber
15:33:37 <Heffalump> KILL! KILL!
15:34:42 <SyntaxNinja> I don't think Heffalumps are supposed to yell that.
15:34:55 <kosmikus> what's the problem?
15:35:10 <tromp> anyone interested in the number of 14x14 go positions:-?
15:35:14 <Heffalump> [23:34] <SyntaxNinja> we should all switch to jabber
15:35:39 <stepcut> we should all switch to AIM...
15:35:45 <SyntaxNinja> tromp: yes. but why 14x14?
15:36:03 <tromp> the biggest we can handle right now:)
15:36:31 <tromp> i need 42GB memory to do 15x15 :(
15:36:39 <Heffalump> make a distributed client
15:36:51 <Heffalump> so, what is the number of 14x14? And have you actually explored the entire state space?
15:36:58 <tromp> slows it down by 1000:(
15:37:13 <tromp> the number of 14x14 Go positions is 212667732900366224249789357650440598098805861083269127196623872213228196352455447575029701325
15:37:23 <Heffalump> what is the 'standard' Go size?
15:37:28 <tromp> 19x19
15:37:49 <paolo> How do you compute them?
15:37:50 <SyntaxNinja> tromp: that's sweet
15:37:58 <tromp> if by exploring you mean brute force enumeration....
15:38:08 <tromp> then the answer is no way in hell!
15:38:11 <SyntaxNinja> tromp: do you remove impossible positions?
15:38:19 <tromp> that's all i do
15:38:23 * SyntaxNinja nods
15:38:30 <tromp> otherwise the answer is 3^196
15:38:34 <SyntaxNinja> so you look at each position and see if its possible?
15:38:55 <paolo> The distribuited idea is nice :-)
15:38:55 <tromp> of course not:(
15:39:44 <tromp> i'm still looking for a good way to partition the data
15:40:05 <Igloo> tromp: Are you doing it by playing all possible games from teh empty board?
15:40:32 <Heffalump> no, that would be exploring the state space, surely.
15:40:38 <tromp> no, if every string has liberties then the position is both legal and reachable
15:40:59 <SyntaxNinja> the ghc manual seems to say that I should do +RTS -p but it just complains if I do that.
15:41:03 <tromp> i use dynamic programming
15:41:18 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: did you compile with profiling?
15:41:19 <paolo> How long does it take to build ghc AND darcs ?
15:41:22 <Igloo> Is that a sufficient check?
15:41:28 <Philippa> tromp: is that provable, or is there possibly some weird interaction with ko?
15:41:42 <tromp> that's perfectly provable
15:41:44 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: yeah. it seems to be complaining that the flags to RTS are wrong, and indeed I don't see -p
15:41:53 <TheHunter> wilx, it's impossible. STRef s is avariant.
15:41:55 <SyntaxNinja> this is 6.2.2, btw.
15:42:03 <tromp> in fact we prove that the go game graph is strongly connected
15:42:07 <SyntaxNinja> paolo: don't build darcs, build cabal.
15:42:29 <Heffalump> what did wilx say?
15:43:04 <tromp> : tests
15:43:13 <tromp> *tests again
15:43:19 <tromp> ;and again
15:43:26 <tromp> how did emoting work here:-?
15:43:28 <TheHunter> Heffalump, <wilx> This [@paste] is my STList. I am trying to define fmap. But I keep failing...
15:43:36 <wilx> Hmm, I don't understand but I'll take your word for.
15:43:38 <Heffalump> oh, ages ago.
15:43:54 <Heffalump> I was worried my client was missing lines or something.
15:44:04 <paolo> SyntaxNinja, what do you mean?  I'm trying to get ubunut guys build it for me, heh
15:44:18 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: is anything being done about making Cabal slightly more usable for windows users and others who don't have shells that understand shebangs?
15:44:33 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: you mean besides VS integration?
15:44:34 <wilx> So fmap is not the way to go...I'll have a look at Data.Generic then.
15:44:41 <Philippa> yes, I don't use VS :-)
15:44:44 <wilx> But has been very confusing so far..
15:44:56 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: what do you have in mind? we seem to have windos users
15:45:21 <tromp> what is the cheapest machine in which you can stick 42GB of memory?
15:45:22 <TheHunter> wilx, first of all, you have to decide what your map should do, copy the list or update it in-place.
15:45:32 <wilx> Copy.
15:45:37 <tromp> Sun must have something like that...
15:46:50 <TheHunter> (realizing in-place update is impossible..) Then you can define a function mapSTList :: (a -> ST s b) -> STList s a -> ST s (STList s b)
15:47:05 <TheHunter> or mapSTList :: (a -> b) -> STList s a -> ST s (STList s b)
15:47:17 <TheHunter> Data.Generics won't help you with that.
15:47:26 <wilx> Ok.
15:47:51 <TheHunter> it's an imperative datastructure, you can't really expect that the functional patterns work on it.
15:48:04 <wilx> I see.
15:48:18 <stepcut> tromp: http://www.shopping.com/xPC-Hewlett_Packard_HP_PROLIANT_ML570_G3_7_3_66_385942001
15:48:32 <stepcut> Maximum RAM    48 GB
15:48:58 <stepcut> at that price, it only comes with 1GB pre-installed :p
15:49:26 <paolo> ajmitch paolo: I think that once 6.4.1 is released, we'll put it in
15:49:27 <paolo> paolo ajmitch, that's the best news of today, and today just started 50 mins ago here :-D
15:49:30 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: atm using it under windows requires either MSYS or similar (which so far everybody serious about haskell under windows has to use) or manually building or interpreting the Setup.lhs
15:49:36 <paolo> Oh - yeah!
15:49:51 <Philippa> it'd be nice to having some kind of package manager that could do the running it from a GUI and possibly downloads and stuff too
15:50:05 <Philippa> which means it's probably something to leave until hackage is up and running too, but hey
15:54:34 <tromp> thx, stepcut
15:56:17 <tromp> too bad it has a sucky xeon cpu
15:56:30 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: maybe... I mean, you could just have a batch file that builds and runs the setup program
15:57:16 <Philippa> yeah, only you'd want that distributed with windows builds of each implementation
15:57:43 <Philippa> the graphical tool'd be nice in the long run if it used hackage too though
15:59:28 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa:  I suggest you post your thoughts to the libraries list. there are several ppl hacking on windows things w/ cabal, and you'd probably get some replies. I'm happy to support whatever makes sense, but I can't help w/ the windows stuff
16:00:27 <Philippa> fair enough
16:48:24 <sylvan> WTH doesn't GHC come with more data structures? Like Queues, priority queues, immutable hashtables etc? Seems like no-brainers to include but yet it isn't, why's that?
16:49:09 <dons> it does
16:50:18 <sylvan> wut? where?
16:50:32 <dons> well, there's Data.HashTable for one
16:50:36 <sylvan> mutable
16:50:41 <dons> mutable
16:50:48 <dons> though everyone uses Map
16:51:08 <sylvan> I'd like an immutable HashTable (for the same reasons Array is useful even though it isn't mutable)
16:51:25 <sylvan> Still, no priority queue that I can find..
16:51:38 <sylvan> I did find a queue now, though
16:51:41 <dons> that's harder, but I think there is one. let me see
16:51:54 <lispy> hi dons
16:52:02 <sylvan> You could implement it using binomial heaps
16:52:08 <dons> oh, Data.Queue
16:52:21 <sylvan> not a priority queueu
16:52:26 <lispy> dons: as you probably know already, lambdabot is down
16:52:26 <dons> hey lisppy
16:52:30 <dons> yep. fixing.
16:52:39 <Pseudonym> Edison isn't shipped any more?
16:52:41 <dons> any idea why it went down?
16:52:42 <lispy> anything serious?
16:52:50 <lispy> no clue
16:52:55 <Philippa> sylvan: would you be able/willing to submit a priority queue implementation to the libraries?
16:52:57 <dons> don't think so - just noticed it myself
16:53:38 <lispy> i've been trying to write a paper so I haven't missed lambdabot too much, but I did notice ;)
16:53:59 <lispy> writing is hard for me
16:54:02 <sylvan> Philippa: Yeah probably, but there must be people more qualified to implement it in the same style as the others (is there a document somewhere about the "GHC-way" of data structures interfaces?)
16:54:09 <lispy> i don't focus on it very well ;)
16:54:27 <Philippa> you can always submit a proposal for critique?
16:54:36 <Philippa> it's easier to criticise an existing proposal than write a new one
16:55:01 <Philippa> I'm not aware of such a document, but you could ask about that on the libraries list too
16:55:26 <sylvan> This one seems promising: http://archive.cs.uu.nl/pub/RUU/CS/techreps/CS-2001/2001-09.pdf
16:55:41 <SyntaxNinja> sylvan: just submit the library / proposal to libraries@haskell.org, make it clear that folks are welcome to change it and / or that you will change it to conform to suggestions.
16:55:51 <dons> yes, we still have edison
16:55:51 <lispy> dons: that's odd, my autocomplete for nicks wasn't even showing lambdabot, but it just said it quit...
16:56:10 <dons> yeah. it appeared to be in some kind of zombie state. it thought it was connected too
16:56:30 <lispy> dons: blame the new ircd code ;)
16:56:47 <lispy> @uptime
16:56:48 <lambdabot> uptime: 1 minute and 45 seconds
16:57:03 <lispy> @vixen welcome back to the land of the living
16:57:04 <lambdabot> you know what? if we'd known it was going to be like this we'd have
16:57:04 <lambdabot> picked our own goddamn cotton!
16:57:44 <paolo> Goodnight folks :-)
16:57:48 <lispy> night
16:58:23 <lispy> dons: any new features in yi since I talked to you last?
16:58:44 <lambdabot> I want BRAINS!
16:58:48 <lispy> hehe
16:58:56 <dons> hmm. what's new in yi. umm. testing!
16:59:12 <dons> oh, killed a performance issue on really really long lines.
16:59:17 <lispy> there were 13 tests the last time i did a darcs pull
16:59:30 <dons> like 1.3M long lines...
16:59:34 <lispy> heh
16:59:41 <lispy> that's just obscene
16:59:57 <dons> someone sent me this crazy haskell file and said "hey, yi is sooo slow!"
16:59:58 <lispy> fwiw, vim can't handle lines like that
17:00:33 <Igloo> vim handles fine if syn hl is off
17:00:39 <lispy> emacs doesn't care how long a line is
17:00:58 <dons> vim handles it.  but getting to the end of  the line can be a bit slow
17:01:14 <dons> going up and down vim doesn't care
17:01:34 <dons> vi doesn't care either.
17:01:49 <dons> ooh. though emacs stalls for about 1s
17:01:59 <Philippa> heh. What's the current state of play with yi, anyway?
17:02:17 <dons> lesson: compiled functional languages beat interpreted ones
17:02:19 <lispy> hmm...i had a friend that was tyring to open a long line file in vim and it was taking them several minutes and they switched to emacs and it was less than a minute.  So maybe it was a weird file for other reasons
17:03:02 <dons> Philippa, steady progress. lots more emacs. another coupla-hundred patches
17:03:18 <lispy> Philippa: well it does tabs now, but it doesn't display long lines quite right.  Otherwise, it appears to be quite usable.
17:03:19 <dons> a betterr plan for syn hl based on the visual haskell paper
17:03:21 * SyntaxNinja notes that he has seen an OS bug, a compiler bug, and a version control system bug in one day
17:03:29 <dons> ETA for syntax highlighting: Haskell Workshop 2005 :)
17:03:51 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: darcs?
17:03:53 <dons> SyntaxNinja wins the jackpot!!
17:03:55 <Philippa> is it buildable from a win/minGW GHC yet? :-)
17:03:59 <Heffalump> so, who's going to ICFP etc?
17:04:05 <Igloo> I'd guess it's taking 9 seconds to load a file with a 10M line and 1s for $ to get to the end of it
17:04:06 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: ja
17:04:09 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: meme!!
17:04:10 <dons> do you want to play for a hardare bug now?
17:04:14 <Igloo> But I CBA to time it properly
17:04:21 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: :(  what is the bug?  is it known and fixed upstream?
17:04:26 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo knows
17:04:42 <dons> Philippa, hmm. maybe? you need ncurses
17:04:55 <dons> otherwise should be ~ok
17:05:10 * Igloo is going to ICFP and suchlike too, but Heff already knew that
17:05:13 <SyntaxNinja> dons: someone's laptop fell off the laptop stand today, perhaps because construction outside the building shook it down
17:05:20 <dons> Heffalump, I have my 20hr flight booked.
17:05:22 <SyntaxNinja> ICFP Par-Tay!
17:05:26 <Igloo> Hmm, really should make sure my laptop still boots etc
17:05:36 <Heffalump> cool.
17:05:44 <SyntaxNinja> hey, do you guys know where you're staying? We should meet up night before or something for some 0xb33r
17:05:57 * Heffalump is hoping to have lots of fun to justify the £1000 or so it's going to cost me personally to attend :-)
17:06:12 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: we'll make it worth your while
17:06:13 * Heffalump is staying in the cheapest hotel on the webpage
17:06:14 <Igloo> Pah, some of the flights from teh UK were longer than that. Admittedly that did involve spending a night in some random European city  :-)
17:06:24 <dons> I'm at the second cheapest :}
17:06:31 <lispy> when is ICFP?
17:06:43 <SyntaxNinja> late sept
17:06:49 <Philippa> if I'm honest I'm most looking forward to a GUI-yi with sufficient GUI customisation possibilities
17:07:21 <Philippa> the sort that'd let me implement something that looked like a good modern IDE on top of it piece by piece
17:07:30 <dons> Philippa, yep. that won't start till after the HW at least. though dcoutts seems interested in Hide2 == gtk2hs + yi
17:08:00 <lispy> i've been learning some opengl maybe that would make a good GUI for yi...
17:08:17 <dons> hehe. lispy, shapr always  said he wanted an opengl gui
17:08:25 <lispy> "Warning: Yi requires 3D hardware acceleration."
17:08:41 <lispy> "Loading Textures....."
17:08:47 <dons> heh
17:09:26 <Philippa> the problem with OGL is you won't get native look'n'feel
17:09:51 <Philippa> I'm rather attached to the UI that's held in common by every app bar one I use at present (and even that one app essentially just skins the same stuff)
17:10:17 <SyntaxNinja> dons: are you in HW?
17:10:20 <lispy> Philippa: but it could be Xtreme
17:10:23 <SyntaxNinja> oh, I see it
17:10:36 <SyntaxNinja> dons: you should get cabal-and-load working for HW :P
17:10:52 <Philippa> lispy: you missed out the "-ly bad"
17:11:11 <lispy> Xtreme Yi, with Synergy to Leverage powerful Collaborative Enterprise, World Class text editing
17:11:37 <Philippa> Xtreme Yi: Best Practice for text editing?
17:11:37 <stepcut> a minor goal of mine is to write an opengl version of nethack... but still "text-based"
17:11:39 <Heffalump> so what's good about Yi, apart from that it's written in haskell?
17:11:40 <Philippa> (as in, everybody'll use it)
17:12:00 <paolo> @pl \x -> foo x $ \y -> bar y
17:12:01 <lambdabot> flip foo bar
17:12:02 <Philippa> it's thoroughly pluggable with plugins in haskell too
17:12:15 <lispy> and plugable at runtime
17:12:23 <Heffalump> is it any good at editing C?
17:12:35 <stepcut> Heffalump: It has dynamically switchable persanalities -- so you can make it act like vi, emacs, pico, or whatever you favorite editor is
17:12:40 <lispy> @pl \x -> you x $ \y -> off y
17:12:40 <lambdabot> flip you off
17:12:46 <Heffalump> lol
17:12:50 <Philippa> stepcut: including an elisp implementation when it's pretending to be emacs?
17:13:02 <lispy> Philippa: i'm working on that
17:13:24 <Philippa> lispy: complete with option to compile bits of elisp into the exe via TH? :-)
17:13:28 <lispy> Philippa: i've got let and lambda implemented....so it will be a while before it's ready :)
17:13:39 <Philippa> well, not into the executable, dynlinked, but hey
17:13:41 <Philippa> heh
17:13:51 <Philippa> TH + hs-plugins = sick :-)
17:13:56 <dons> SyntaxNinja, yep, I'm presenting the yi paper.
17:14:01 <lispy> Philippa: sorry, it's meant for transitioning from emacs only, so it will be deprecated from version 1 ;)
17:14:02 <Philippa> I really need to go mess around with that now hs-plugins works on win32
17:14:03 <Heffalump> at HW?
17:14:08 <dons> and I agree with the poinnnt about cabal and load. that would be good
17:14:25 <dons> Heffalump, at HW yep
17:14:27 <Heffalump> It's a shame TFP is so expensive (for what is essentially a workshop)
17:14:34 <Heffalump> cos it looks quite cool
17:14:58 <SyntaxNinja> dons: I just want to get more papers at HW to reference the cabal paper they rejected ;)
17:15:13 <dons> hehehe
17:15:22 <SyntaxNinja> I was hoping "haskell ready to dazzle the real world" would mention cabal, but it doesn't.
17:15:48 <Philippa> and it's not ready to dazzle the real world, not yet. I mean, we're getting on for critical mass, sure
17:16:05 <Heffalump> hehe
17:16:14 <Heffalump> what were the reasons for rejection?
17:16:31 <shrimpx> C++: dazzling the real world for 3 decades
17:16:41 <monochrom> haha
17:17:08 <Philippa> I'm not sure "dazzling" is the word. And it's not been around that long
17:17:25 <dons> 2 decades
17:17:29 * Heffalump suggests you keep up the new-found spirit of conflict on #haskell by blaming kosmikus personally for the rejection, too ;-)
17:18:56 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: it did get into TFP
17:19:14 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: I have no problem with kosmikus, I just have this really intense rivalry with darcs.
17:19:23 <stepcut> SyntaxNinja: haha
17:20:02 <Heffalump> you shouldn't focus on just one conflict. You'll get all bitter and twisted.
17:20:49 <SyntaxNinja> there was this one guy who hated me because i was sorta more of a 'practical' opensource guy, and he was more of a fsf kinda guy.  he really really hated me. I ran into him months after we had some stupid conflict and he still hated me.
17:20:55 <lispy> SyntaxNinja: does galois use darcs?
17:21:18 <SyntaxNinja> I haven't had an arch nemesis since that guy (though he still hates me). david might be worthy, so we need to get this rivalry heated up.
17:21:40 <SyntaxNinja> lispy: no :(
17:22:13 * Philippa wonders if she counts as a 'practical' opensource girl
17:23:03 <SyntaxNinja> to give you an idea of what I mean by 'practical': I agreed to release a piece of software to students of a class that was mostly open source, but some of the libraries didn't include the code because the students were to do them as assignments
17:23:25 <SyntaxNinja> this was non-free to him, so he threw a fit.
17:23:34 <dons> ah!
17:23:38 <stepcut> hahaha
17:23:46 <lispy> heh, lame
17:23:49 <shrimpx> i know a guy like that. Karl Hegbloom
17:23:53 <Philippa> because you didn't release all of it? That's pathetic
17:24:00 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: yeah :)
17:24:01 <Philippa> I mean, nobody's *ever* obligated to release everything they do
17:24:06 <shrimpx> notorious debian guy who prays to Stallman
17:24:13 <Philippa> we'd be drowning in random shite otherwise
17:24:49 <Philippa> I mean, you don't need 400 broken variants on checkers for an H-M-based system
17:25:51 <SyntaxNinja> sorry, we're getting off topic... who's with me, and who is with david?
17:26:11 <lispy> shrimpx: that's a name i haven't heard in a while
17:26:19 <Philippa> hey, you got that wrong. You're supposed to insist we have to be with one or the other
17:26:35 <stepcut> SyntaxNinja: sign me up for your side
17:26:36 <Philippa> or rather, one xor the other
17:26:38 <lispy> i have a question about RMS, what does he use as a search engine?
17:26:43 * Heffalump is with the terrorists
17:26:52 <stepcut> Heffalump: perl users ?
17:26:59 <Igloo> SyntaxNinja: In the spirit of the conflict, I will take whichever side will causes most anger to be generated
17:29:15 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: that's what I meant.
17:29:24 <shrimpx> taking sides? everyone's opinion sucks.
17:29:30 <shrimpx> except mine.
17:29:47 * lispy hits shrimpx with a bar stool
17:29:52 <lispy> take that!
17:29:55 <shrimpx> crap
17:29:59 <Beelsebob> anyone here do any camping?
17:30:01 <Heffalump> stepcut: yeah, that sounds about right
17:30:03 <SyntaxNinja> me!
17:30:13 <Heffalump> my girlfriend does, if that helps
17:30:15 <shrimpx> lispy: karl goes to psu
17:30:16 <Philippa> Beelsebob: I was in a field for CCDE, but I don't really camp seriously. Unless you mean while playing CS
17:30:25 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: you should join david's side so stepcut can fight you
17:30:35 <fnord123> awpwhores
17:30:37 <Heffalump> surely Igloo is David's chief lieutenant?
17:30:37 <lispy> shrimpx: ah, interesting
17:30:57 <SyntaxNinja> oh yeah, we shouldn't trust him.
17:30:57 <Beelsebob> anyone who does... care to take a look and check I've not missed anything stunningly obvious for 10 days in the highlands? http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/tatd2/campingList.html
17:31:16 <Philippa> fnord123: fuck no. You wanna camp properly, you use an AK and learn to shoot properly. You can kill twice as fast that way!
17:31:30 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: west highland way, by chance?
17:31:33 <Philippa> that and you're not utterly fucked if someone gets close to you...
17:31:44 <Beelsebob> syntax: not with that pile of junk, no
17:31:56 <Beelsebob> anyway... I did that when I was 15... in 7 days ;)
17:32:02 <Heffalump> does Tent include pegs etc?
17:32:07 <Beelsebob> yeh
17:32:11 <Beelsebob> oh... but not a big hammer
17:32:15 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: I did it w/ a pile of junk
17:32:23 <stepcut> Beelsebob: are there bears in the area ?
17:32:28 <Beelsebob> nope
17:32:34 <Heffalump> is "Coat" for walking waterproof?
17:32:35 <Beelsebob> syntax: yeh? ouch!
17:32:40 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: I see something blindingly obvious
17:32:42 <Heffalump> and what about walking trousers, socks etc.
17:32:43 <SyntaxNinja> damn, Heffalump beat me to it
17:32:43 <shrimpx> lispy: i still have the star wars ascii thing =)
17:32:53 <Heffalump> and spare batteries for the camera
17:32:59 <Beelsebob> heffalump: coat is aka "Portable Personal Bus shelter"
17:33:07 <Heffalump> is it light?
17:33:10 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: water purifier
17:33:10 <stepcut> Beelsebob: are you going to use leaves to wipe your ass ?
17:33:27 <Beelsebob> syntax: water is purified by the peat in Scotland ;)
17:33:27 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: but he can drink pure highland spring water ;-)
17:33:31 <SyntaxNinja> fine
17:33:33 <fnord123> yes the aks were goo
17:33:33 <Beelsebob> stepcut: well spotted
17:33:34 <fnord123> good
17:33:38 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump: yeah yeah
17:33:43 <fnord123> i havent played since beta 6 though
17:33:49 * Heffalump has never been walking in Scotland. I should go.
17:33:50 <stepcut> Beelsebob: perhaps a toothbrush...
17:33:59 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: tent sealer
17:34:06 <Beelsebob> stepbag: part of the washbag
17:34:11 <Beelsebob> syntax: ????????
17:34:12 <Heffalump> Beelsebob: if you are taking the car insurance certificate in case of being stopped by the police, you also need the MOT and v5
17:34:20 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: waterproof cover for backpack?
17:34:24 <Beelsebob> heffalump: really????????
17:34:28 <Heffalump> and make sure you have your counterpart driving licence as well as the main photocard
17:34:31 <Beelsebob> syntax: part of the backpack :)
17:34:47 <Beelsebob> yeh... licence means the counterpart... I always carry the card
17:34:51 <Heffalump> Beelsebob: presumably you are taking the certificate so that you don't have to go home to get it to present the lot at a police station within seven days.
17:34:53 <SyntaxNinja> if your tent leaks in the first rain, you'll want to have it in order to reseal the seams
17:35:05 <Heffalump> and the lot is MOT, V5, insurance + your full licence, IIRC.
17:35:14 <stepcut> Beelsebob: What about dish washing stuff??
17:35:21 <Beelsebob> heffalump: yeh, usually you're just asked for insurance and licence
17:35:28 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: I like a headlamp for setting up the tent at night
17:35:32 <Beelsebob> stepcut: yeh... washing up liquid is always a plan
17:35:36 <Heffalump> I've never actually been stopped in the UK. But I think they can demand the lot.
17:35:45 <Heffalump> My Dad has lots of experience of being stopped speeding :-)
17:35:47 <SyntaxNinja> oh yeah, and they make this soap that's good for washing yourself, your hair, and dishes
17:36:08 <Beelsebob> really?
17:36:15 <Beelsebob> sounds hard to find
17:36:18 <stepcut> Beelsebob: do you have to carry all this stuff on your back? Or do you just drive somewhere and set it up ?
17:36:28 <Beelsebob> stepcut: driving :)
17:36:33 <lament> headlamps are awesome
17:36:33 <Heffalump> you forgot sausages on the food list.
17:36:33 <SyntaxNinja> driving?!
17:36:58 <stepcut> Beelsebob: ok, if you had to carry it, I would recommend cutting a few things ;)
17:37:00 <Beelsebob> heffalump: food that will go off is not on the list
17:37:04 <Heffalump> steaks..
17:37:09 <Beelsebob> except the steaks that are first night
17:37:13 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: that soap isn't hard to find in the US anyway
17:37:20 <Heffalump> well, you should get sausages to. Sausages are great.
17:37:23 <Beelsebob> this is stuff that I have to take on the way
17:37:25 <lament> it's called "regular soap"
17:37:31 <lament> and can be found in most stores
17:37:36 <Beelsebob> hehe, okay, I'll add sausages
17:37:40 <Heffalump> YAY! SOSSIDGES!
17:37:40 <SyntaxNinja> lament: I forgot to mention that it's bio-friendly
17:37:45 <lament> SyntaxNinja: ahh
17:37:55 <Beelsebob> lament: I think you'd have trouble washing dishes with a bar of soap
17:37:57 <lament> meh, i'm a vandal
17:37:58 <Philippa> Heffalump: one of the main features of our regular gaming night is that my ex-housemate brings sausages from his local butcher :-)
17:38:09 <lament> Beelsebob: I don't. I have plenty of experience doing exactly that.
17:38:10 <fnord123> condoms
17:38:15 <SyntaxNinja> what are midge coils?
17:38:26 <stepcut> Beelsebob: what's with the midget repellant and midget killer ??
17:38:32 <Beelsebob> syntax: things that you burn and they repel midges
17:38:41 <lament> midget repellent!?!??!
17:38:41 <Beelsebob> stepcut: never bean to scotland have you ;)
17:38:46 <SyntaxNinja> he really hates midges
17:38:51 <lament> hahaha
17:38:59 <Heffalump> do you intend to use something random soft as a pillow?
17:39:09 <Beelsebob> heffalump: yep
17:39:15 <stepcut> damn midgets
17:39:19 <Heffalump> you can't spell "Sandwich"
17:39:29 <Beelsebob> with difficulty
17:39:33 <fnord123> midge = mayflies in the US
17:39:36 <fnord123> i think
17:39:45 <Heffalump> is your first aid kit checked for out-of-dateness?
17:39:48 <fnord123> those swarmy black dots
17:39:50 <SyntaxNinja> Beelsebob: have you seen "second skin" or body glide? both may be good for blisters during long walks, though bandaids also work
17:40:09 <Beelsebob> syntax: yeh, plasters were the plan
17:40:17 <SyntaxNinja> what are plasters?
17:40:19 <stepcut> Beelsebob: how about a can openner ?
17:40:20 <Heffalump> sensible emergency equipment for hill walking also includes a whistle and a survival blanket
17:40:24 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: bandaids
17:40:28 <Beelsebob> stepcut: well spotted
17:40:30 <Heffalump> but in English
17:40:32 <SyntaxNinja> compass!!
17:40:35 <Heffalump> oh yes, that too
17:40:36 <lament> swiss army knife i hope
17:40:45 <fnord123> bandaid is a brand of plaster
17:40:47 <lament> guitar
17:40:54 <Beelsebob> syntax: probably a good plan
17:40:56 <lament> guitar is the most important thing
17:40:57 <Heffalump> in the US it just means plaster, IIRC.
17:41:00 <lament> beer is the second most important
17:41:08 <Heffalump> they don't really do the English language very well ;-)
17:41:12 <lament> and/or weed
17:41:22 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump:  we probably invented the damn things
17:41:25 <SyntaxNinja> :P
17:41:28 <Beelsebob> heh, weed is in plentiful suply on the west coast
17:41:28 <fnord123> brand indoctrination
17:41:39 <Heffalump> what do you intend to peg your clothes to, out of interest?
17:41:48 <fnord123> poison ivy is a  weed on the east coast. it sucks
17:41:52 <Beelsebob> heffalump: the bit of string, or the guy ropes
17:42:03 <lament> Beelsebob: where are you going?
17:42:10 <Beelsebob> here... http://www.henniker.org.uk/images/places/scotland/high2003/Shieldaig01.jpg
17:42:17 <Heffalump> do you have spoons for stirring your coffee and tea?
17:42:33 <stepcut> Beelsebob: are you going to bring all the drinking water you need ?
17:42:35 <Beelsebob> heffalump: eating utensils
17:42:41 <lament> wait that's a town of some sort
17:42:43 <Philippa> stepcut: you see the "beer" entry? :-)
17:42:44 <Beelsebob> stepcut: no, the burns there are fine
17:42:48 <Beelsebob> lol
17:42:53 <stepcut> Beelsebob: burns ?
17:42:53 <Heffalump> spoons aren't an essential part of eating utensils, so I was checking :-)
17:43:00 <Heffalump> stepcut: Scottish for streams
17:43:07 <Beelsebob> burn = small scottish stream
17:43:17 <stepcut> Beelsebob: they don't need to be filtered or anything ?
17:43:20 <Heffalump> they don't speak English so well up there either ;-)
17:43:28 <fnord123> ok 1,40 am. bed time for british boys, wouldnt you say?
17:43:32 <Beelsebob> stepcut: it's all peat bog, natural filters
17:43:45 <Heffalump> fnord123: naah. I don't have to be in work till 10am or so tomorrow.
17:43:46 <Beelsebob> fnord: nah, been up till 3 or 4 the last few nights... too much work
17:43:47 <Heffalump> (today)
17:43:56 <stepcut> Beelsebob: that's fortunate, pumping water filters is rather boring
17:44:06 <Beelsebob> stepcut: I can imagine
17:44:11 <fnord123> im in for 8
17:44:15 <SyntaxNinja> stepcut: what about chemical purifiers?
17:44:24 <Heffalump> my old job I used to get in at 11 or 12 normally
17:44:29 <Beelsebob> it's especially useful halfway round a walk, you can just refil your bottle from a stream
17:44:33 <Beelsebob> http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=57.524851,-5.647380&spn=.136246,.529678&hl=en
17:44:34 <stepcut> SyntaxNinja: I have only used the pumps...
17:44:34 <Heffalump> really. Highland spring water is nice and pure.
17:44:37 <Beelsebob> here if you prefer
17:44:42 <lament> i like pumping water filters
17:44:47 <stepcut> Beelsebob: I only see 'torch' listed as a light source... what does that mean ?
17:44:48 <lament> all that pumping action
17:44:49 * SyntaxNinja has sampled highland spring water :)
17:45:01 <Beelsebob> stepcut: ?
17:45:14 <stepcut> Beelsebob: don't you need flashlights and stuff ?
17:45:24 <Beelsebob> ... torch
17:45:39 <Beelsebob> unless that means something different in the US
17:45:41 <fnord123> torch is what the colonies call a flashlight
17:46:14 <Beelsebob> thiss one I don't intend to get up... http://www.craggy.org.uk/torridon_27-3-04/Torridon-March-2004-023.jpg
17:46:27 <lament> torch is a stick of wood with the tip wrapped in oiled cloth
17:46:44 <fnord123> a torch is a portable light provider
17:47:30 <stepcut> Beelsebob: ok.. I thought torch might be something like this: http://www.polsteins.com/lamfarincbam.html
17:47:53 <lament> but definitely take a headlamp if you have one, they're really convenient
17:48:00 <Beelsebob> here a torch would be one of these... http://www.maglite.com/index.asp?m=skipflash
17:48:07 <Beelsebob> I don't have one :(
17:48:40 <Heffalump> get a cheap one
17:48:41 <lament> a harmonica is also nice to have :)
17:48:51 <fnord123> i saw in foreign policy or whatever high brow mag they had maglite ads suggesting that you were going to be attacked by terrists and you needed a maglite as part of your equipment
17:48:58 <lament> binoculars
17:48:58 * Beelsebob uploads a new list... and wonders if he's missed anything in the torrent
17:48:59 <fnord123> it was pretty sad
17:49:01 <Heffalump> you really should have enough kit to be able to cope with nasty stuff happening while walking up/down hills
17:49:04 <stepcut> Beelsebob: A lattern might be nice if you can get your hands on one: https://www.ebizenterprise.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=40577
17:49:06 <Beelsebob> lament: good plan
17:49:20 <Beelsebob> stepcut: good plan... my mum has one
17:49:27 <fnord123> charge your mobly before heading ou
17:49:29 <fnord123> out
17:49:38 <Beelsebob> fnord, good point
17:49:40 <Heffalump> fnord123: cos the signal in the Highlands is likely to be great ;-)
17:49:46 <lament> haha
17:49:55 <lament> do you have gps?
17:50:01 <Heffalump> though I guess if they had signal up Ben Stack you can probably get it on the top of any hill.
17:50:10 <stepcut> Beelsebob: in addition to wash-up liquid, you probably want some spongees/scrubing things
17:50:12 <Heffalump> though that is quite near a road
17:50:20 <fnord123> its saved lives
17:50:30 <Beelsebob> lament: I might be able to grab my mum's semi-knackered one
17:50:43 <Beelsebob> heffalump: you can get a sygnal on top of most hills
17:50:48 <Beelsebob> it's in the glens you have a problem
17:51:09 <Heffalump> fair enough. I sort of managed to get one on the top of Scafell Pike.
17:51:13 <fnord123> deoderant in case you meet your future wife in a pub up there
17:51:38 <fnord123> or out of a pu
17:51:38 <fnord123> pub
17:52:02 <lament> deodorant is definitely a nice touch
17:52:10 <lament> not just for the future wife
17:52:11 <fnord123> and facial tissue
17:52:25 <lament> and some sort of hand sanitizer
17:52:25 <Beelsebob> fnord: wash bag
17:52:31 <stepcut> Beelsebob: I don't see toilet paper on the new list, unless it is called something weird like 'seat mats' or is in the wash bag...
17:52:32 <lament> (that you don't need to rinse off)
17:52:35 <fnord123> walking stick
17:52:49 <fnord123> sheleighleigh or however you say it in celtic
17:52:50 <Beelsebob> fnord: wuss :D
17:53:02 <Heffalump> they can be quite useful, especially when going down things
17:53:05 <Beelsebob> stepcut: good point... it got missed in the torrent
17:53:14 <lament> you mean hiking poles, not walking stick :)
17:53:20 <Philippa> Beelsebob: lovely mental image there
17:53:20 <Beelsebob> heffalump: I know... but they also cost about ¬£30
17:53:29 <Beelsebob> philippa: lol
17:53:35 <Beelsebob> well... a big stick doesn't
17:53:37 <Beelsebob> but hey
17:53:41 <fnord123> toilet paper is maple leaves
17:53:47 <stepcut> Beelsebob: a whistle, if you have one
17:53:49 <fnord123> unicycle
17:54:00 <Beelsebob> stepcut: good plan
17:54:04 <Beelsebob> fnord: also a good plan
17:54:10 <Beelsebob> oh... space blanket
17:54:17 <fnord123> trebuchet
17:54:35 <Beelsebob> :o
17:54:38 <lament> a couple porn magazines
17:54:48 <fnord123> blacks on blondes
17:54:49 <Beelsebob> I don't *think* I'm going to be seiging any castles fnord
17:54:57 <stepcut> Beelsebob: you may want a small shovel (for digging your restroom holes, etc)
17:55:14 <Beelsebob> stepcut: gonna go to margionally more civilized places than that ;)
17:55:22 <fnord123> stiletto +2 +3 vs undead
17:55:26 <stepcut> Beelsebob: ah, ok
17:55:56 <stepcut> Beelsebob: will there be trash recepticles ?
17:56:05 <Beelsebob> stepcut: plastic bags ;)
17:56:17 <Beelsebob> useful for a million things
17:56:21 <lament> cyanide capsule
17:56:38 <Beelsebob> :o
17:56:49 <lament> you never know when you're gonna need one
17:56:55 <stepcut> Beelsebob: ah, I was thinking that meant something like 'zip-lock bags'
17:56:59 <fnord123> rohypnol
17:57:06 <Beelsebob> bugger... my spare phone battery is dead
17:57:20 <Beelsebob> fnord: ????
17:57:27 <Beelsebob> is that a joke an american would get?
17:57:41 <fnord123> any dodgy bastard will get it :)
17:57:46 <Beelsebob> oh, okay
17:57:46 * stepcut gets it, and is american...
17:58:03 * Heffalump gets it, and isn't
17:58:26 <fnord123> http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1715140,00.html
17:58:27 * Beelsebob gets it thanks to google
17:58:42 * Philippa gets it, and beats fnord123 around the head with a vinegar-soaked piece of barbed wire
17:58:53 <Beelsebob> ouch
17:58:57 * fnord123 is aroused
17:59:02 <Philippa> I didn't say which head, either
17:59:05 <Heffalump> oh dear.
17:59:08 <Beelsebob> haha
17:59:13 * Heffalump goes to bed
17:59:19 <Philippa> fnord123: you won't be capable of that for much longer :-)
17:59:28 <fnord123> its the internets. I can be completely non sequitor and face no consequences. :)
17:59:38 <Beelsebob> hehe
18:00:03 <fnord123> I'm also off to bed, but dont read too much into the timing
18:00:06 <fnord123> the scandal!
18:00:23 <Heffalump> fnord123: if we can work out where you live, I reckon the channel has got enough geographic distribution in the UK to be able todeliver retaliation in person :-)
18:00:36 <Beelsebob> haha
18:00:45 <Heffalump> but you've gone, and freeserve is useless for geographic tracking anyway.
18:01:05 <Beelsebob> we just need to catch him at work ;)
18:01:16 <Heffalump> does he IRC from work too?
18:01:23 <Beelsebob> don't know
18:01:33 <Beelsebob> YAY... AIM's back
18:01:59 * Philippa is tempted to point out that "no consequences" only holds if it's impossible to find a mental image or barrage thereof that causes someone pain
18:02:12 <Philippa> it's amazing what you can do with text and a little determination
18:02:16 <Beelsebob> haha
18:02:45 * Beelsebob wonders why the makers of this boot maintainance product called it G-Wax
18:03:07 * Beelsebob can't help but think dodgy thoughts
18:03:09 <Philippa> is the tip curved?
18:03:27 <Beelsebob> the tip?
18:03:54 <Philippa> certain items designed for "polishing" where you're thinking of differ from more general examples by having curved tips
18:04:09 <Beelsebob> ah, I see
18:04:39 <Beelsebob> well, this particular product I think requires you to use your hand, perhaps with some covering as an aplicator
18:04:42 <Beelsebob> :)
18:04:58 <Philippa> I assume it's somewhat slippery?
18:05:05 <Beelsebob> it certainly is
18:06:35 <Beelsebob> ... and I think I might be there on the list
18:06:47 <Philippa> ?
18:06:54 <Beelsebob> the camping kit list
18:46:03 <lispy> anyone in here into fanfic?
18:46:17 <lispy> well, fanfic or machinima?
18:46:37 <Philippa> I've seen some okay machinima but it's no big deal for me unless it's good. Likewise fanfic, I guess
18:47:02 <Beelsebob> lispy: yes
18:47:10 <lispy> do you think you would participate in either if you had tools that made it painless?
18:47:12 <Beelsebob> no to machinima
18:47:32 <Philippa> I think I wrote a small amount of what'd technically count as fanfic at some point
18:47:32 <Beelsebob> lispy: I'm not sure what more you need than a text editor for fan fic
18:47:55 <Philippa> actually IIRC I wrote UFO:Enemy Unknown fanfic in an english GCSE exam :-)
18:47:56 <Beelsebob> and for fanart all you need is my good friend photoshop
18:48:30 <Beelsebob> hehe... the kind of fanfic I write would get me looked at very strangely if I'd written it for Standard Grade
18:48:32 <Philippa> I might occasionally do silly bits and pieces by the way of machinima I guess, but I don't think a sufficiently easy tool is in fact possible without a mind-reading interface
18:48:39 <Philippa> so I gathered :-)
18:48:45 <lispy> yeah, maybe fanart and fanfict are already easy to make and share
18:49:14 <lispy> Philippa: indeed
18:49:24 <Beelsebob> philippa: my latest chalenge from a friend is "Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Electric Toothbrush"
18:49:42 <Philippa> far too easy
18:49:54 <Philippa> unless the capitals in Electric Toothbrush are needed
18:49:57 <Beelsebob> easy yes... but I'm sure I can be more imaginative than that
18:50:10 <Philippa> reinventing oral kind of thing, then?
18:50:31 <Beelsebob> heh... interesting
18:51:10 * Beelsebob wonders what would happen if you wrote gay porn for Standard Grade
18:51:34 <lispy> i was thinking a community of fanfic/fanart/machinima where sharing the content is easy and the system bring "cool stuff" to you would be popular
18:51:59 <Beelsebob> lispy: that actually sounds like a remarkably cool idea
18:52:06 <Pseudonym> http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15825756&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=er--you-what--luv---name_page.html
18:52:12 <lispy> Beelsebob: making it work would be hard :)
18:52:25 <Beelsebob> so something like a database of fanfic tagged with lots of meta data?
18:52:26 <Philippa> it sounds suspiciously like an automation of stuff LJ does already though
18:52:30 * lispy needs to get his tinyurl function fixed
18:52:34 <Beelsebob> that anyone can contribute to
18:52:37 <Philippa> especially now it's got tags
18:52:58 <lispy> Philippa: yeah, LJ would support that community well
18:53:06 <Philippa> "would"?
18:53:08 <Philippa> it already /does/
18:53:14 <lispy> although, in the case of machinima it would be hard
18:53:17 <Philippa> I have slashers on my friends list :-)
18:53:28 <lispy> Philippa: does it really bring the data to you or do you have to find it?
18:53:50 <Pseudonym> I really, really don't get slash.
18:53:50 <Philippa> depends how you set things up. The communities system lets you subscribe to something other than 'everything one person does'
18:54:07 <Philippa> I mostly read it for humour value (and thus not often)
18:54:10 * Pseudonym nods
18:54:15 <Philippa> though I can see some of the other attractions
18:54:17 <Pseudonym> I kinda get the celebrity fetish thing.
18:54:22 <Pseudonym> But with slash, they're not even REAL.
18:54:38 <Philippa> slash tends to be more the situations, though it depends
18:54:49 <Pseudonym> True.  So I guess that would appeal to women more.
18:54:53 <Philippa> and it's all very much an imagination thing - but hey, all the best sex is in the head anyway
18:54:59 <Pseudonym> Well, yeah.
18:55:09 <Pseudonym> Oh, I get erotic fiction.
18:55:16 <Pseudonym> Just not erotic fanfiction.
18:55:27 * Beelsebob wonders why the police think that 24 hour licensing means there will be *more* people will be on the streets at 11
18:55:48 <Philippa> existing backstory, for one
18:55:55 <Pseudonym> (My wife does some freelance cover art for romance novels.  I've seen a LOT of erotic fiction.)
18:56:05 <Pseudonym> (Some of it quite bad.)
18:56:08 <Philippa> not to mention a lot of additional culture about who the characters are if you're talking about something commonly slashed
18:56:11 <Pseudonym> (But it sells.)
18:56:16 <Pseudonym> True, actually.
18:56:31 <Pseudonym> It's probably easier to write because exposition is hard to do well.
18:56:45 <Pseudonym> With fanfic, you don't have to bother with that.
18:57:00 <Philippa> that, and you can write a short piece with the advantage of still having had it
18:57:13 <Beelsebob> yeh...
18:57:17 <Philippa> I mean, everyone knows about draco and harry, right?
18:57:22 <Beelsebob> haha
18:57:29 <Beelsebob> and Harry/Snape
18:57:33 <Beelsebob> and Snape/Draco
18:57:36 <Beelsebob> .....
18:57:46 <Philippa> and Damien's got a thing for a Jin/Hwoarang pairing in Tekken that even most non-slashers would nod at if mentioned
18:57:48 <Pseudonym> Can I confess something?
18:57:52 <Pseudonym> I've never read any Harry Potter.
18:57:58 <Beelsebob> Snape/Draco punishment fic has become popular after book 6
18:58:05 <Philippa> are you aware of who draco is?
18:58:10 <Pseudonym> Vaguely.
18:58:26 <Philippa> I hadn't read any HP until after moving in with Damien and having nothing better to do at the time
18:58:33 <Pseudonym> Fair enough.
18:58:49 <Philippa> you probably know just about enough about draco to get the basic tension involved in that kind of piece, anyway
18:58:51 <Pseudonym> Oh, I don't hate it or anuything.  Just never got around to it.
18:59:03 <Philippa> a lot of the publicity put me off
18:59:08 <Pseudonym> I figure anything half-decent that gets kids reading must be a good thing.
18:59:13 <Philippa> not that I'd have made any effort to read it anyway
18:59:30 <Philippa> yeah. I'd far rather any kids of mine read the Northern Lights trilogy though
18:59:53 <Pseudonym> Point taken, but I'd far rather that any kids in general just read stuff.
19:00:01 <lispy> Philippa: what is that about?
19:00:24 <Philippa> um, there're several answers. The ones that'll most make you want to read it contain spoilers
19:00:30 <Pseudonym> Meeting.  BBS
19:00:40 <Philippa> an ideal antidote to narnia if nothing else though
19:00:42 <lispy> Philippa: hmm..what is the setting?
19:00:56 <Philippa> first book starts in an alternate Oxford, UK
19:01:13 <lispy> antidote to narnia?
19:01:16 <Philippa> for reasonably "fantasy" values of alternate, but no silly barbarians or anything
19:01:20 <lispy> is that good for narnia or bad?
19:01:28 <Philippa> well, the narnia books have a few issues
19:01:50 <lispy> i don't remember those books very well
19:02:06 <lispy> in fact, not at all now that i really think about it :)
19:02:36 <Philippa> 'k. I don't have any problems with the level of christian allegory going on per se, but there're certain things that the books hint at that really rather bother me
19:03:01 <Philippa> eg one of the main characters is denied future access to narnia essentially because she's found the very beginnings of sexuality
19:03:03 <lispy> sexism?
19:03:15 <lispy> ah
19:04:07 <Philippa> now, given the allegory aspect there's something really quite nasty about that
19:04:27 <Lemmih> Good morning, #haskell.
19:05:00 <Philippa> you /could/ form religious beliefs around the Northern Lights books, but if you do so you've got something fundamentally wrong. The bits that'd be worth doing that about're actually deeper than religion
19:06:19 <Lemmih> Philippa: Have you checked out HSP/FastCGI?
19:06:35 <Philippa> anyway, they're a plenty good read for adults too, more so than the Potter books. And they're less childish than the first two potters and better edited than HP4 onwards :-)
19:06:59 <Philippa> Lemmih: nope. I probably should though
19:07:16 <Lemmih> Philippa: http://212.242.49.100/hsp/Browse
19:07:54 <lispy> Philippa: i'll have to recommend that trilogy to my gf, she reads a lot so she's more likely to make good use of the recommendation :)
19:07:58 <Philippa> cool
19:08:26 <Philippa> oh, Northern Lights is the name of the first book, the author's Philip Pullman
19:08:31 <Philippa> the trilogy's His Dark Materials, my bad
19:08:40 <lispy> okay
19:08:51 <Philippa> Lemmih: we're getting there step by step :-) I figured out how to do templates
19:09:02 <Philippa> unfortunately I'm a bit braindead to code it up at the moment
19:09:11 <Philippa> but the trick's easily explained
19:09:26 <Lemmih> Philippa: How about making pages Haskell scripts without IO?
19:09:29 <Philippa> in fact it can be summed up in a pseudotype :-)
19:10:11 <Philippa> heh. I was just going to have HTML with embedded IO HTML or IO String code, plus room to add definitions and imports and stuff
19:10:20 <Philippa> though a non-IO monad would make good sense for a lot of purposes
19:11:22 <Philippa> anyway, I'm inclined to say get a working hack that does something then let people who've done more of this kind of stuff than me work out what a good implementation looks like
19:12:08 <Philippa> anyway, the trivial idea is to translate the template into a haskell program that generates the appropriate HTML. May as well compile it and cache the object code 'til the template's updated for that matter
19:12:40 <Philippa> stuff like layout makes a sane translation a little awkward to achieve though, or I'd have working code already
19:12:52 <Philippa> so, er, want room to talk? :-)
19:13:12 <lispy_> layout?
19:13:16 <lispy_> in haskell or html?
19:13:45 <Philippa> there's no layout rule in HTML. That's kinda the problem if you embed haskell in it
19:14:14 <lispy_> can you insert explicit syntax to avoid the layout?  like do { foo; bar }
19:14:17 <Philippa> you need to account for how the code'll like be laid out in practice, which is aligned to the inside of the starting tag and then as per normal
19:14:28 <Philippa> yes, but I shouldn't require users to do it
19:14:45 <Philippa> and as soon as my code needs to be layout-aware, my job gets a lot harder :-)
19:14:48 <lispy_> right, i meant, can YOUR transformation insert....
19:15:03 <lispy_> ah, yeah...
19:15:04 <Philippa> it stops being a 30-minute hack from idea to output
19:15:14 <Igloo> I haven't been following the discussion, but I think with XHTML you can tell it to preserve the whitespace if that's the issue
19:16:20 <Philippa> the issue is that I need a parser
19:16:48 <Philippa> and it's a lot easier if I can just do the trivial "if it's between tags dump it this way, if not then that way" thing
19:16:48 <lispy_> doesn't ghc have a parser which is ready to use?
19:17:00 * lispy_ nods
19:17:01 <Philippa> AIUI it's not ready for this purpose
19:17:18 <lispy_> ah, too bad :)
19:19:30 <lispy_> looks like it's time for me to do NeHe lesson 08
19:19:39 <Beelsebob> which is that?
19:19:42 <Philippa> oh god, those things
19:19:43 <lispy_> blending
19:19:45 <Beelsebob> graduated from cubes yet?
19:19:50 <Beelsebob> oh... no then
19:19:54 <lispy_> Beelsebob: nope :)
19:19:59 <Lemmih> lispy_: In Haskell?
19:20:05 <lispy_> Lemmih: yup
19:20:12 * Philippa remembers the number of NeHe Ninjas she's had to explain basic things about C to because they'd neglected to learn the language first
19:20:21 <Beelsebob> heh
19:20:21 <lispy_> Lemmih: i'm told you have them all haskellized, shapr gave me a link
19:20:34 <lispy_> Philippa: heh
19:20:44 <lispy_> "NeHe Ninjas" nice term
19:21:01 <Philippa> I've been hanging around gamedev chans a long time
19:21:12 <lispy_> Lemmih: did you ever send them in to Jeff Moloboboeffobobbey?
19:21:19 <Lemmih> lispy_: Yeah, I would be pleased if you could mail me any lessons you've ported to Haskell.
19:21:35 <Lemmih> lispy_: Nay, not yet.
19:22:01 <lispy_> Lemmih: i could, are you making a collection?
19:22:09 <Lemmih> Yes.
19:22:18 <lispy_> i'm trying to keep my translations as close to the C code as is reasonable
19:22:40 <Lemmih> Using GLUT?
19:22:46 <lispy_> so it's not pretty haskell, but it makes comparing the two versions a bit easier
19:22:47 <lispy_> yes
19:23:21 <lispy_> yours use the SDL as i recall...
19:23:21 <Beelsebob> glut unfortunately sucks donkeys balls when you get farther in
19:23:34 <Lemmih> And GLUT doesn't like GHCi.
19:23:39 <lispy_> Beelsebob: why is that?
19:23:51 <lispy_> Lemmih: oh, i haven't had any problems so far, what should i watch out for?
19:24:17 <Beelsebob> lispy: doesn't let you control things like lots of windows, pixel format, fullscreen/windowed combos etc
19:24:23 <Beelsebob> it has many problems
19:24:45 <Lemmih> lispy_: GLUT doesn't terminate GHCi after you've finished 'mainLoop'?
19:25:20 <lispy_> Lemmih: i mostly use runghc for this, so i guess i haven't notcide
19:25:55 <Lemmih> Re-linking the program every time a change is made is _so_ slow on my box.
19:26:22 <Beelsebob> linking is????
19:26:36 <Beelsebob> usually linking takes a fraction of the compile time for one file on my box
19:26:51 <lispy_> yeah, compile time is what kills me
19:27:32 <Lemmih> Linking takes several seconds on my box where complication is almost instantaneous.
19:27:44 <Beelsebob> what kind of box is it?
19:27:45 <Lemmih> *compilation
19:27:57 <Beelsebob> I think complication is a good word for it
19:28:04 <Lemmih> 2Ghz Athlon.
19:28:16 <Beelsebob> oddness
19:28:17 <lispy_> i'm on an ibook
19:28:20 <Beelsebob> ditto
19:28:25 <Beelsebob> and a Mac Mini
19:28:54 <Beelsebob> and the 3.2 Ghz P4 in my office is too fast at compilation *and* linking to tell which takes time
19:29:16 <Beelsebob> ... the whole of glibc and gcc in 20 minutes :)
19:30:16 <Lemmih> lispy_: Have you tried compiling the program?
19:30:33 <lispy_> Lemmih: i did once
19:30:39 <lispy_> but mostly i use runghc
19:31:01 <Lemmih> And it didn't spend most if its time linking?
19:31:28 <Lemmih> s/if/of/
19:31:32 <Philippa> linking's slow here, but usually the amount of compiled code compared to the size of the libraries being linked against is tiny
19:31:51 <Philippa> it can be really horrible with wxHaskell
19:32:05 <Beelsebob> hmm, even against big libraries here linking's fast
19:32:20 <Beelsebob> could be down to prebinding
19:32:24 <lispy_> Lemmih: i just tried it from ghci, mainLoop causes ghci to exit :(
19:32:27 <Lemmih> OSX is weird (:
19:33:27 <lispy_> Lemmih: compiling takes almost twice as long
19:33:51 <lispy_> i did use -O2, fwiw
19:35:05 <Lemmih> Can you notice a different without it?
19:36:15 <lispy_> i'll check
19:37:20 <lispy_> approximately the same time
19:39:53 <interferon> is "the craft of functional programming" or hudak's book better for a haskell newbie?
19:40:16 <Beelsebob> Thompson'ss
19:40:19 <Beelsebob> -s
19:45:08 <Beelsebob> hehehehehehehe http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/33193011/6897559
19:51:26 <Beelsebob> This song is really moving
20:25:46 <Korollary> whoa, I am reading slashdot comments for the article on new programming models, and Haskell has been mentioned several times. What the monad ?
20:26:14 <Philippa> the daft thing is that there's a very real sense in which FP predates the hardware computer :-)
20:27:28 <Korollary> lambda calculus before assembly eh
20:27:48 <dons> heh. new D[D[D[Dprogramming models. right. esp. since the turing machine was developed to compute the same thing as lambda calculus
20:28:55 <Korollary> did you mean to type the "D[D[D[D" or is it Wifi Strikes Again ?
20:29:04 <dons> wifi :/
20:29:52 <dons> escape chars dropped off left arrow
20:29:58 <Korollary> bah, I have to study the GoF book for my upcoming phone interview...
20:32:29 <Pseudonym> Yikes.
20:32:34 <Pseudonym> That's dumb.
20:32:38 <Pseudonym> Seriously.
20:33:00 <Philippa> I can see how a place'd do it
20:33:02 <Pseudonym> Anyone who thinks that design patterns == GoF book never read it or never understood it.
20:33:32 <Philippa> OTOH, it's not stupid to use it as (part of) a baseline for pattern knowledge with attached labels
20:33:58 <Pseudonym> Well, I suppsoe.
20:34:05 <Korollary> Well, they mainly use it as a common vocabulary from what I understand.
20:34:14 <Pseudonym> OK, fair enough.
20:34:24 <Pseudonym> We do it too, but we don't assume everyone has STUDIED it.
20:34:44 <Philippa> that said, they'd likely still get upset if you described the visitor pattern as a kludge for a canonical graph traversal function
20:35:07 <Pseudonym> Maybe, maybe not.
20:35:28 <Pseudonym> Certainly the Real Experts(tm) fully admit that most design patterns are there to make up for deficiencies in the language.
20:35:37 <Pseudonym> That's true in Haskell, too.
20:35:57 <Pseudonym> Many deficiencies are also features.
20:36:12 <Korollary> Philippa: Well I was reading the compositor pattern, and they spent several paragraphs on how to deal with the fact that a leaf (primitive) is not a composite. It looks to me like the subclass != subtype problem, but I fear saying stuff like that.
20:36:27 <lispy_> i just saw this question, Give the fully simplified form of the polynomial (x - a) (x - b) ... (x - z)
20:36:50 <Pseudonym> lispy_: I'd say that's simpler than most representations.
20:37:14 <lispy_> Pseudonym: yes, that's what i said before i figured out a better answer
20:37:56 <Pseudonym> Oh, duh.
20:37:57 <Pseudonym> Of course.
20:38:01 <Korollary> It could contain fewer terms if you expand it
20:38:03 <lispy_> http://thedailywtf.com/forums/39887/ShowPost.aspx
20:38:06 <Pseudonym> However, there is a definitional problem here.
20:38:16 <lispy_> Pseudonym: that's what i said :)
20:38:21 <Pseudonym> I argue that it is unknown what is in the ellipses.
20:38:47 <Pseudonym> And it also depends on the alphabet.
20:39:20 <lispy_> Pseudonym: well, wouldn't you argue that a..z are roots, and those they are names for values in a field or ring, where as the *variable* x is not a binding for a value
20:39:50 <Pseudonym> Indeed.  Usual convention would be that x is unknown, and a..z are constants.
20:40:06 <Pseudonym> (Using freer terminology.)
20:40:06 <lispy_> Pseudonym: yeah, so it seems weird that the term (x-x) = 0
20:40:10 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:40:18 <Pseudonym> I therefore conclude that it's not really there.
20:40:27 <lispy_> but that is what they author of the question intended people to conclude
20:40:28 <Korollary> bah
20:40:54 <Pseudonym> Well, he should have been more clear.
20:40:56 <Pseudonym> Or she.
20:41:01 <Pseudonym> Let's not be sexist, now.
20:41:10 <lispy_> yeah, woman make mistakes too!
20:41:13 <lispy_> er women
20:41:40 <lispy_> it's a cute problem, but not meant to be taken seriously
20:41:48 <Korollary> maybe it was a computer generated problem
20:42:15 <Pseudonym> In which case the problem might be different in a different character set.
20:42:32 <Korollary> right. maybe the x we see is the chi
20:44:16 <lispy_> stupid time
20:44:30 <lispy_> how did it get to be 20:45 already
20:44:38 <Korollary> second by second
20:44:44 <Pseudonym> You might be near a black hole?
20:44:49 <Korollary> do you have a military background ?
20:45:02 <lispy_> Korollary: no
20:45:17 <Korollary> very few people in the US would state it as "20:45"
20:45:18 <lispy_> Pseudonym: but then it would slow down for me...
20:45:37 <takuan> i'd say it is 12:45
20:45:42 <lispy_> Korollary: yeah, i think hanging out on irc has influenced my clocking speaking
20:45:48 <Pseudonym> Yeah, but if you briefly went near a black hole, and then came out, you might find that time had advanced.
20:45:58 <lispy_> Pseudonym: ah, very true
20:46:18 <Pseudonym> I set all my clocks to 24 hour because then I don't need to specify AM or PM.
20:46:21 <monochrom> every haskell program may contain a black hole
20:46:25 <Pseudonym> true!
20:46:37 <lispy_> @eval let x = x + 1 in x
20:46:39 <lambdabot> runplugs: <<loop>>
20:46:39 <lambdabot>  
20:46:42 <lispy_> omg! there is one now!
20:46:58 <lispy_> @eval let x = 1 + x in x
20:46:59 <lambdabot> runplugs: <<loop>>
20:46:59 <lambdabot>  
20:47:05 <Pseudonym> let omega = omega in getTime
20:47:09 <monochrom> if you don't run ntp or something, your computer clock may drift greatly by running too many haskell programs
20:47:13 <lispy_> lambdabot: i have to get up pretty early to fool you
20:47:49 <monochrom> for this reason C/C++ still has its use - for time servers.
20:48:15 <Korollary> ugh. why is that ?
20:48:43 <lispy_> monochrom: no blackholes
20:48:46 <lispy_> ?
20:49:03 <Korollary> I guess I am lost on the theoretical physics side of the joke
20:49:06 <monochrom> right
20:52:45 * lispy_ goes to finish lesson08
20:52:50 <lispy_> my goal is to do at least one a day
20:53:31 <lispy_> even if that means not doing laundry, buying groceries, or getting to bed on time ;)
20:55:19 <Pseudonym> C still has its uses, of course.  Unix is a C virtual machine.
20:55:25 <Pseudonym> It's the abstract assembly language of Unix.
20:56:36 <lispy_> and unix seems to be a good enough OS
20:56:54 <Pseudonym> http://www.math.upenn.edu/%7Ewilf/DownldGF.html
20:56:55 <lispy_> it's sometimes hard to retro fit it with what is popular, but people usually find a way
20:56:58 <Pseudonym> Anyone read this?
20:57:08 <lispy_> nope
20:57:40 <lispy_> i can't tell what it's about from the title
20:57:47 <Pseudonym> It's about generating functions.
20:57:48 <Pseudonym> :-)
20:58:22 <Pseudonym> Actually, Unix would be a lot simpler if it didn't require maintaining a C stack.
20:58:30 <Pseudonym> I think signal delivery is the only real "gotcha".
20:59:03 <dons> @eval let x = 1 + x in x
20:59:04 <lambdabot> Loop
20:59:39 <Pseudonym> @eval let g = g ++ show g in g "let g = g ++ show g in g "
20:59:41 <lambdabot> 41:
20:59:41 <lambdabot>   The function `g' is applied to one arguments,
20:59:41 <lambdabot>   but its type `[Char]' has none
20:59:52 <lispy> dons: i think you sohul dadd the << and the >> back, just so it's not easy to mistake it for real output
20:59:57 <Pseudonym> @eval let g s = s ++ show s in g "let g s = s ++ show s in g "
20:59:59 <lambdabot> "let g s = s ++ show s in g \"let g s = s ++ show s in g \""
21:00:12 <monochrom> Neato!
21:00:17 <Pseudonym> I wonder if there's a way to avoid the quoting.
21:06:00 * TheHunter can only think of a way using overlapping instances..
21:06:21 * Pseudonym is guessing that isn't a one-liner
21:07:34 <TheHunter> not really, and error messages might become horrible.
21:08:30 <lispy> can you write it in TH so that you don't have the redundancy?
21:09:50 <TheHunter> hmm.
21:10:02 <TheHunter> @type show `Data.Generics.extQ` id
21:10:03 <lambdabot> forall a. (Data.Typeable.Typeable a, Show a) => a -> String
21:11:14 <Pseudonym> @eval show `Data.Generics.extQ` id "test"
21:11:15 <lambdabot> 23: Not in scope: `Data.Generics.extQ'
21:11:19 <Pseudonym> Errr.
21:11:29 <Pseudonym> Never mind.
21:12:39 <dons> lispy, well no one gets confused by:
21:12:43 <dons> @eval let f () = f () in f () :: ()
21:12:47 <lambdabot> Terminated
21:12:50 <dons> so I don't think "Loop" will hurt
21:13:11 <Pseudonym> Or you could make it print <<Terminated>>
21:13:17 <dons> that too
21:13:35 <lispy> <<T1000 was here>>
21:13:45 <dons> or: lambdabot sez: what's wrong with you fool!
21:14:05 <lispy> <<Insert Blackhole>>
21:16:32 <monochrom> hahahaha
21:17:12 <Arrogant> Hey. Is there a Haskell interpreter that allows you to create functions dynamically?
21:17:21 <lispy> Arrogant: ghci
21:17:34 <lispy> let f x = x + 1
21:17:40 <lispy> f 1
21:17:43 <lispy> => 2
21:18:41 <Arrogant> Ah. Okay.
21:18:41 <lispy> not to be too whiny, but HOpenGL is very inconsistent about how to enable/disable functions
21:19:02 * Arrogant is using Haskell for math class
21:19:11 <Arrogant> Easier to define things on the fly than to write a file every time.
21:19:32 <lispy> some of them use Maybe (pass in Nohing to disable) and other have an explicit function that you pass the value Enable/Disabled and then set the function they use somewhere else
21:20:14 <lispy> and the haddock documentation should say which functions correspond to the API functions
21:20:25 <lispy> where is the source for hopengl?
21:20:57 <TheHunter> @index :=
21:20:59 <lambdabot> Control.Parallel.Strategies
21:21:02 <TheHunter> @index $=
21:21:03 <lambdabot> Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL.GL.StateVar, Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL.GL,
21:21:03 <lambdabot> Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL, Graphics.UI.GLUT
21:21:09 <Pseudonym> Hugs with :e isn't a bad alternative to writing a file every time.
21:21:17 <TheHunter> @libsrc Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL
21:21:18 <lambdabot> http://darcs.complete.org/fptools/libraries/OpenGL/Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL.hs
21:21:44 <Pseudonym> Hmmm...
21:21:57 <Pseudonym> Why hasn't my program factorises RSA640 yet?
21:22:02 <Arrogant> Pseudonym: Hmm. Sounds good.
21:22:04 <Pseudonym> I've given it a couple of days...
21:22:42 <lispy> TheHunter: cool, thanks
21:22:59 <TheHunter> if you're using debian, there's also the ghc-libsrc package.
21:26:21 <lispy> TheHunter: the darcs source is perfect, that way I can send in documentation augementations ;)
21:27:39 <TheHunter> lispy, you better check that with CosmicRay, the official library source is cvs-maintained.
21:29:07 <lispy> TheHunter: oh, bummer
21:29:21 <lispy> man, alpha blending is really nice
21:30:05 <lispy> lesson08 went pretty quick
21:30:26 <lispy> faster than the time it takes darcs to record my patch ;)
21:30:52 <lispy> i guess i need to break my data up into a bunch of repositories...
21:31:20 <TheHunter> what's lesson08?
21:33:04 <lispy> alpha blending
21:33:23 <lispy> there is a stained glass texture that you load onto a cube
21:45:01 <TheHunter> \\
21:45:09 <TheHunter> sorry.

22:16:31 <lispy> i see, i don't need sequence if I'm using mapM
22:22:18 <Korollary> it all depends on what you are trying to do
22:28:02 <dons> mapM f as       =  sequence (map f as)
22:29:07 <lispy> I wanted IO [a], so mapM turned out to be perfect

23:05:03 <gaal> how do i get an expression that matches type Int, but which when evaluated, yields bottom?
23:05:49 <lispy> myint :: Int
23:05:52 <lispy> myint = undefined
23:05:53 <lispy> ?
23:05:56 <lispy> is that the same thing?
23:06:05 <gaal> more generally: i think i read somewhere that all types (or was it all primitive types?) have a bottom value, but is there a way to get at them?
23:06:26 <gaal> ah, undefined looks just like what i want, thanks :)
23:06:55 <lispy> @type error
23:06:56 <lambdabot> forall a. [Char] -> a
23:07:15 <lispy> error has the same property but lets you give a message
23:07:49 <lispy> i usually use error and undefined when i write function stubs
23:08:15 <gaal> i was trying to verify something was lazy.
23:09:22 <lispy> ah, good idea
23:13:57 <lispy> lesson09.hs:193:18:
23:13:58 <lispy>     Couldn't match `Vector3 a' against `Vertex3 a1'
23:13:58 <lispy>       Expected type: Vector3 a
23:13:59 <lispy>       Inferred type: Vertex3 a1
23:14:10 <lispy> what is GHC trying to say?
23:14:15 <lispy> oh
23:14:17 <lispy> n/m
23:14:29 <lispy> vector != vertex
23:21:18 <icb> what's the easiest way to get formatted time as a string?
23:22:18 <Korollary> sweet
23:23:27 <gaal> icb, http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System.Time.html
23:23:32 <gaal> do you want the local time?
23:23:52 <icb> yah
23:24:21 <icb> i was looking at the formatCalendarTime
23:40:41 <Lemmih> @seen nibro
23:40:42 <lambdabot> nibro is in #haskell. I don't know when nibro last spoke.
23:40:59 <Lemmih> @uptime
23:41:00 <lambdabot> uptime: 6 hours, 45 minutes and 57 seconds
23:45:36 * dons realises on the bus that unix shell cmds implement much of Data.List
23:45:54 <dons> implements List poorly and ad hoc, of course
23:46:33 <Korollary> ...and Shaskell is born !
23:47:10 <Korollary> Wasn't Windows Vista going to have a command shell named Monad ?
23:47:18 <Pseudonym> telnet 64.142.4.132
23:47:24 <Pseudonym> Don't go there all at once.
23:47:40 <Pseudonym> http://www.homebrewcpu.com/photo_gallery.htm <- Pictures of what you're telnetting to.
23:48:13 <lispy> Pseudonym: ah, yeah isn't that inspiring :)
23:48:25 <lispy> Pseudonym: here is another fun one, telnet codersbase.com
23:48:26 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
23:48:42 <Pseudonym> I hAx0R3d the machine!
23:48:47 <Pseudonym> Oh, I've seen this.
23:48:57 <dblhelix> Korollary: yeah, I seem to remember to have heard of that... never saw anything like that appearing... or did I just missed something?
23:50:00 <Korollary> dblhelix: They pulled it. There were some "concept virii" that worked on Monad as well. Maybe that had something to do with it.
23:51:48 <dblhelix> Korollary: wasn't the big idea that programs running in the shell could be combined by means of some standardized interface?
23:52:21 <dblhelix> a more structured approach to piping?
