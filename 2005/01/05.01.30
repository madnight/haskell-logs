00:01:07 <tintin> welcome to the club :)
00:01:21 <NYRanger> tintin: what college do yo go to?
00:01:49 <tintin> NYRanger: I went to college in India 
00:02:09 <tintin> www.amrita.edu 
00:05:13 <tintin> except for one or two of the profs the rest were all below power 
00:06:57 <NYRanger> tintin: yep same here.
00:08:46 <NYRanger> tintin: we had one professor who never really taught us anything, openyl criticized our homework as well.
00:09:23 <tintin> oh thats not bad :) as one that makes you copy homework from books :)
00:09:32 <tintin> they are bad but not the worst 
00:11:22 <NYRanger> well this teacher used to always be tired
00:11:32 <NYRanger> and would go on 30 minute rants about computer topics like Microsoft and Linux
00:12:29 <NYRanger> plus he would focus his class to much on coding and not enough on theory.  He was never organized and never brought in prepared lesson plans.
00:22:22 <tintin> they are all the same all over the world ... there are good ones and there are bad ones and very bad ones 
02:37:59 <bourbaki> moin
02:39:20 <Lemmih> Morning.
02:40:20 <xerox> hiya!
05:48:14 <musasabi> Is it possible to have ghc generate a "stack trace" when an exception is thrown (and the app is closed) ?
05:48:48 <xerox> <Cale> isSorted xs = and $ zipWith (<=) xs (tail xs)
05:48:51 <xerox> Does it really work?
05:49:32 <TheHunter> xerox, why shouldn't it?
05:50:04 <xerox> zipWith (<=) [1,2,4,3] [3] would return [True] right?
05:50:40 <TheHunter> right, the length of zipWith f xs ys is the length of the shorter list
05:50:51 <xerox> whoops.
05:51:04 <xerox> tail is more like CDR, okay.
05:51:32 <xerox> hmm, but it isn't even correct.. I can't understand
05:52:04 <TheHunter> isSorted xs = and $ zipWith (>=) (tail xs) xs wouldn't work for the empty list.
05:52:51 <xerox> Ah, I got it.
05:53:21 <xerox> For a list [1,2,4,3] it expands to zipWith (<=) [1,2,4,3] [2,4,3]
05:53:53 <TheHunter> yes, kinda
05:56:46 <tromp> hi folks
05:57:04 <xerox> hi!
05:57:15 <tromp> anyone have experience using ST monad?
05:58:15 <tromp> or do you never need any ST(U)Arrays??
06:01:35 <tromp> *test
06:01:39 <tromp> ;test
06:02:14 <autrijus> ...
06:14:55 <wli> hmake debian package is FITA
06:15:30 <ibid> fita?
06:15:53 <wli> broken (the literal translation is vulgar)
06:16:05 <ibid> is it a word or an acronym?
06:16:11 <wli> acronym
06:16:32 <ibid> i know the p variant but never heard that f variant :)
06:16:48 <wli> then you can easily surmise its precise meaning
06:17:04 <tromp> sounds like a cross between fubar and pita
06:17:17 <ibid> ah, that kind
06:17:31 <wli> the 'f' is the vulgar part; the rest you should not need help with
06:17:34 <ibid> just couldn't at first make that particular f word work in that context
06:19:53 <Nioate> musasabi: I recall seeing something about a stack trace somewhere
06:20:14 <TheHunter> speaking of ST, has anyone ever succeeded in defining ST in pure haskell?
06:20:42 <ibid> how do you define pure haskell?
06:20:48 <Nioate> musasabi: ah, http://haskell.org/hawiki/TipsAndTricks in the Debugging section
06:20:59 <ibid> as i recall, you need some extensions
06:21:03 <ibid> type system extensions
06:21:12 <TheHunter> well, ghc with extensions (especially gadts), but no usafe stuff.
06:21:23 <ibid> but otherwise there shouldn't be any need for unsafe stuff
06:21:30 <tromp> have you used the st monad, TheHunter?
06:21:30 <musasabi> Nioate: thanks.
06:21:35 <ibid> of course, its efficiency may or may not be up to par
06:21:46 <TheHunter> tromp, not extensively.
06:22:17 * Lunar^ is catching up latest CVS commit
06:22:25 <tromp> i'm wondering how to deal with additional state
06:22:36 <Lunar^> death of .hi-boot...
06:23:27 <tromp> i'm using 3 arrays in my ST s monad, but need to add some Int's of state
06:23:28 <TheHunter> ibid, i don't care about efficiency. Well, I'll give it a shot.
06:23:50 <ibid> TheHunter: i suppose the original papers should give hints
06:23:51 <TheHunter> and STRefs aren't appropriate?
06:24:12 <tromp> i dont know them:(
06:24:18 <tromp> from which library?
06:24:26 <tromp> @index STRef
06:24:26 <lambdabot> Data.STRef,Data.STRef.Lazy,Data.STRef.Strict,GHC.STRef,GHC.STRef
06:24:49 <TheHunter> they're just like IORefs.
06:25:27 <tromp> ah yes, that looks like just what i need
06:25:30 <tromp> thanks!
06:26:04 <tromp> was starting to worry about having to wrap the ST monad inside a StateT :-(
06:28:01 <autrijus> well you can still put those STRefs into a Record
06:28:07 <autrijus> and access them with ReadreT
06:28:09 <autrijus> ReaderT even
06:28:26 <autrijus> that way you won't have to pass them around or use (gasp) implicit params
06:29:32 <tromp> @index ReaderT
06:29:32 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.RWS,Control.Monad.Reader,Control.Monad.RWS,Control.Monad.Reader
06:31:10 <autrijus> I think I've put this on the wiki somewhere.
06:31:44 <autrijus> @wiki StateMonad
06:31:44 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/StateMonad
06:59:33 <Lemmih> CosmicRay: The size of Char is 4 bytes.
06:59:48 <autrijus> (or 8 bytes if you are fortunate enough)
06:59:53 <CosmicRay> I wondered, since there were functions to convert it between ints
07:00:11 <Lemmih> autrijus: huh?
07:00:33 <autrijus> never mind. my mistake.
07:01:21 <Lemmih> CosmicRay: And yes, the other 24 bits are thrown away.
07:01:39 <CosmicRay> interesting.
07:01:53 <CosmicRay> so I'd need my own unicode codec
07:02:11 <CosmicRay> otoh that is the most straightforward way to go
07:02:13 <musasabi> haskell has all the bad sides of utf32 and none of the good sides.
07:02:26 <CosmicRay> it would be confusing if putChar writes out 4 bytes sometimes.
07:02:54 * autrijus agrees with musasabi vehemently.
07:11:48 <redhatPT> hello m8s
07:12:32 <Lemmih> Hello roedhaette.
07:13:04 <redhatPT> need help: is there some function that returns the time that other function has runned?
07:13:11 <redhatPT> sorry my bad english :S
07:14:27 <musasabi> redhatPT: I would use a difference with System.CPUTime
07:15:30 <redhatPT> musasabi gonna try
07:18:39 <redhatPT> is there any module that I must import?
07:20:28 <musasabi> yes.
07:20:35 <musasabi> System.CPUTime
07:20:51 <musasabi> @type System.CPUTime.getCPUTime
07:20:52 <lambdabot> System.CPUTime.getCPUTime :: IO Integer
07:22:27 <xerox> What's the meaning of the word "curry" in currying/uncurrying ?
07:22:49 <xerox> I understand what they do, I don't know what the word mean.
07:23:19 <musasabi> It is named after a person.
07:23:35 <ibid> xerox: Haskell B. Curry
07:23:46 <ibid> xerox: though the proper name is probably schönfinkeling :)
07:23:49 <xerox> Really? Did he invent it?
07:23:58 <ibid> xerox: no, but he popularized it
07:24:06 <xerox> How was it called before?
07:24:11 <ibid> it wasn't
07:24:46 <ibid> to curry and schönfinkel, it was just a trick, there was no name for it as far as i know
07:25:14 <ibid> i mean, curry popularized it. schönfinkel probably invented it
07:25:36 <xerox> foo = schÃ¶nfinkel zip
07:25:37 <xerox> gee :P
07:25:44 <araujo> Morning.
07:25:57 <xerox> hi!
07:50:42 <basti_> hi all
07:50:45 <shapr> y0
07:50:56 <basti_> Lemmih: are you there?
07:50:58 <basti_> hi shapr 
08:03:07 <shapr> hoi Jan_w 
08:03:20 * shapr hops
08:03:39 <autrijus> yo.
08:04:13 <shapr> wassup?
08:04:23 <Jan_w> hi
08:04:32 <autrijus> finally getting back to perl coding today.
08:04:35 <Jan_w> well i've moved :)
08:04:43 <Jan_w> 230 km south 
08:04:51 <autrijus> "You enter what seems to be an older, more primitive world"
08:05:31 <shapr> Jan_w: wow, you've moved to the warm and sunny south?
08:05:42 <Jan_w> hehe, not really :
08:05:43 <Jan_w> :)
08:05:48 <shapr> autrijus: yeah, I understand... I made some blog posts about Python giving me a procedural headache.
08:06:09 <shapr> How far have you gotten into The Brick Book?
08:06:39 <shapr> autrijus: you don't have a blog or self portraits.
08:06:43 <autrijus> 13. Reference
08:06:49 <autrijus> 152 pages in 2 days now.
08:07:03 <autrijus> there is a portrait in http://autrijus.org/ .
08:07:18 <autrijus> http://par.perl.org/index.cgi?AutrijusTang too.
08:07:55 <shapr> nifty
08:08:36 <shapr> I think I've seen that one before. Do you know SachaC? What's that neat outfit you're wearing on your homepage?
08:09:21 <autrijus> the outfit is a poncho. the photo was taken in tibet.
08:09:29 <autrijus> I don't know sachac.
08:11:18 <shapr> she's worth knowing.
08:12:01 <shapr> What do you think about type theory so far?
08:12:37 <shapr> church numerals were new for me, it was neat to get exposure to 'functional assembly language'
08:13:03 <autrijus> I learned LazyK and Unlambda before reading the brick book
08:13:06 <autrijus> so that part was easy.
08:13:27 <autrijus> the Y combinator was somewhat scary and seemingly unneccessary.
08:13:37 <autrijus> but then I remembered that it's for eager evaluation.
08:13:57 <autrijus> so the extra loop thing is needed to keep Y from diverging.
08:15:24 <autrijus> have you used functional metapost?
08:16:51 <shapr> no, I haven't
08:16:58 <shapr> but I think I should try it.
08:17:37 <shapr> why is Y unneccessary in lazy eval?
08:17:50 <autrijus> I'm seriously considering rewriting a few of my most clever cpan modules in haskell. Template::Generate, for example.
08:17:52 <xerox> hi shapr!
08:17:58 <shapr> hiya xerox 
08:18:17 <shapr> Is there a one sentence summary of Template::Generate? or should I utsl?
08:18:18 <xerox> I'm fighting with class/instance now, complex thingies.. :-)
08:18:30 <autrijus> (it takes a structure and a web page, and generates the TT2-style template neccessary to make them work.)
08:18:49 <autrijus> another of my work, Template::Extract, takes a template and a document, and gives you the data structure.
08:18:56 <autrijus> TT2 is the de facto perl templating toolkit.
08:18:59 <shapr> aha
08:19:06 <shapr> I was just asking google that same question.
08:19:20 <autrijus> it's like reversing a .jsp.
08:19:27 <shapr> that's way cool
08:19:32 <autrijus> yeah. :)
08:20:09 <shapr> The way I understood jsps was that it's a string concatenation class turned inside out.
08:20:14 <autrijus> so, under lazy eval:
08:20:17 <autrijus> fix f = let x = f x in x
08:20:28 <Lemmih> basti_: Yes.
08:20:45 <autrijus> that's all you need to write; there's no need to repeat (f f) twice.
08:20:56 <shapr> oh, I see what you mean.
08:21:03 <basti_> Lemmih: did you have fun with my script?
08:21:32 <shapr> Giving a data structure from template and document sounds like magic.
08:21:47 <autrijus> shapr: it's actually the more tractable of the two.
08:22:22 <Lemmih> basti_: What script?
08:22:24 <autrijus> generating the template is generally indeterminate.
08:22:27 <shapr> Wow, is the approach documented? Or should I read the source?
08:22:28 <basti_> Lemmih: i'm Bastiaan Zapf
08:22:35 <basti_> Lemmih: lol
08:22:38 <basti_> Lemmih: sorry
08:22:47 <basti_> Lemmih: youre not Henning are you?
08:22:55 <Lemmih> No. I'm Lemmih (:
08:23:00 <autrijus> shapr: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Extract/ 
08:23:11 <basti_> sorry i confused you with someone who's email ad is lemming...
08:23:14 <autrijus> shapr: you need to read the source I'm afraid. basically it compiles it into a giant regex.
08:23:32 <shapr> ok
08:23:35 <autrijus> shapr: and abuse perl's regex engine (because you can eval arbitary code inside arbitary match point)
08:23:41 <autrijus> so I get NonDet for free.
08:23:55 <shapr> scary
08:23:55 <autrijus> the problem with it is it's very hard to debug :)
08:23:59 <Lemmih> basti_: No problem (o:
08:24:00 <shapr> yeah, I believe it.
08:24:24 <autrijus> but I imagine this technique would be generally useful :)
08:26:35 <shapr> Wow, Template-Generate is really nifty.
08:26:59 <autrijus> thank you.
08:27:12 <autrijus> I do think that rewriting it in haskell will capture the algorithm better.
08:28:01 <shapr> I understood the rabhi and lapalme book well. It clarified a lot of stuff in my head.
08:28:01 <TheHunter> autrijus, you can write fix f = let x = f x in x in haskell because the fixed point combinator is implicit. It is impossibe to write such a combinator as a closed lambda term, because it doesn't typecheck.
08:28:26 <foldl[A]> good day
08:28:37 <shapr> óla foldl[A] 
08:28:51 <foldl[A]> :)
08:29:13 <shapr> So, what's the value of A in that list? ;-)
08:29:18 <foldl[A]> lol
08:29:25 <foldl[A]> its supose to mean away lol
08:29:41 <shapr> autrijus: have you used/read about Zope Page Templates?
08:29:59 <autrijus> shapr: I've read about it.
08:30:25 <autrijus> TheHunter: the context in the brick book is untyped lambda calculus.
08:30:30 <autrijus> TheHunter: but, noted.
08:30:49 <shapr> Do you know of other elegant templating systems? I'd like to have a Zope-like application in Haskell and I'm always looking for better approaches.
08:31:11 <autrijus> I hear that RTML is elegant.
08:31:14 * shapr wonders how to mix Template-Generate and ZPT/Halipeto
08:31:45 <TheHunter> autrijus, right, this stuff is only possible in untyped lc, in a typed lambda calculus, the only way to get general recursion is either introducing a fixed point combinator or allowing recursive let bindings.
08:33:22 * TheHunter gives up trying to write a pure ST monad.
08:34:07 <shapr> Neat, RTML is nice.
08:34:09 <autrijus> shapr: oh. http://wheatform.org/ has a certain elegance.
08:34:12 <autrijus> bbiab.
08:34:13 <autrijus> &
08:35:28 <foldl> shapr....
08:35:29 <shapr> dns name doesn't exist
08:35:34 <shapr> foldl: yes?
08:35:39 <foldl> can you help me in something realy quick?
08:35:45 <shapr> it is possible.
08:35:53 <foldl> im having trouble combining two functions
08:35:54 <shapr> But you have to ask your actual question before I can answer.
08:36:03 <foldl> its simple
08:36:07 <foldl> this time :)
08:36:17 <shapr> Ask the question.
08:36:42 <foldl> [(Int,Int)] -> (Int,Int)
08:37:00 <foldl> where the firts int is the sum of all the first ints
08:37:09 <foldl> and the second int the sum of all the second ints
08:37:18 <shapr> What have you tried so far?
08:37:34 <foldl> [(1,2),(3,4)] = (4,6)
08:37:38 <foldl> hmm
08:37:46 <autrijus> I mean http://wheatfarm.org/ :)
08:38:00 <foldl> somaPreco :: (Int,Int) -> (Int,Int) -> (Int,Int)
08:38:00 <foldl> somaPreco (a,b) (x,y) = (a+x,b+y)
08:38:03 <foldl> i made this
08:38:18 <shapr> that's a good first step
08:38:19 <foldl> now im trying to aply it to [(Int,Int)]
08:38:19 <foldl> but i cant
08:38:36 * autrijus looks at foldl's nickname
08:38:39 * shapr grins
08:38:44 * shapr laughs
08:38:47 * foldl glares
08:38:52 <shapr> foldl: that's a hint.
08:39:03 * foldl ?
08:39:06 <shapr> @type foldl
08:39:07 <lambdabot> foldl :: forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
08:39:15 <foldl> oh....lol
08:39:19 <foldl> omg
08:39:32 <foldl> lemmetry
08:39:47 <autrijus> and you already have all the pieces!
08:39:52 <autrijus> well, you need another (0,0)
08:39:53 <tromp> @type sum
08:39:54 <lambdabot> sum :: forall a. (Num a) => [a] -> a
08:40:57 <autrijus> that works too.
08:41:25 <shapr> At first glance, Wheat looks like Zope.
08:42:11 <autrijus> except it is painfully RESTish.
08:42:16 <autrijus> # http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/wheat/r1/app/Attic/blog.ws?view=markup
08:42:16 <shapr> Zope has Archetypes, which are close to 'Naked Objects' but more like objects designed to be 'web published'.
08:42:46 <shapr> I've seen two flavors of webpages, templates and navigation.
08:43:15 <shapr> I've thought of mixing those two approaches by doing something like 'deriving WebPublish' in Haskell.
08:43:31 <autrijus> WASH belongs to neither.
08:43:33 <shapr> Where it would generate web-based view/edit/input boilerplate for that datatype.
08:43:36 <autrijus> I think WASH is totally cool.
08:43:47 <shapr> It's kindof a pain in the ass to use though.
08:44:02 <autrijus> it needs a good web based editor UI like seaside.
08:44:14 <shapr> WASH ideas were very clear and powerful in the earlier version.
08:44:21 <shapr> version(s)
08:44:48 <shapr> I do really like continuation based navigation. That's an awesome idea.
08:45:26 <shapr> But I don't like dependence on JavaScript and forms.
08:45:32 <foldl> omg
08:45:32 <humasect> seaside is great..
08:45:35 <Heffalump> continuation based navigation is a very old idea
08:45:37 <foldl> Thx alot
08:45:45 <foldl> it works now, its so simple....
08:45:50 <foldl> sry o bother :P
08:45:54 <shapr> Wow, it's raining here. wtf.
08:46:02 <foldl> ?!
08:46:48 <shapr> Heffalump: Sure, but it's never worked well in Haskell. Is continuation based navigation older than John Hughes' arrows paper?
08:46:55 <Heffalump> true
08:47:05 <Heffalump> but WASH is not a good solution IMO.
08:47:16 <Heffalump> not if it relies on Javascript
08:47:23 * Lemmih goes to sleep. Code in peace, Haskellers.
08:47:24 <shapr> WASH dumps continuations into /tmp via Show
08:48:04 <shapr> You have a choice of timeout and/or manual expiry to clean continuations out of /tmp
08:49:15 <shapr> It's a neat approach, sort of like forward-only monads. It keeps users from submitting old information in old forms.
08:49:15 <shapr> Wow, now it's hailing.
08:49:32 <shapr> This is not the usual Arctic weather.
08:49:39 <autrijus> wash doesn't need javascript until recent versions.
08:49:59 <autrijus> and you can apparently comment out a few lines to make it nonjavascript.
08:50:40 <Heffalump> ah, does it still work then?
08:51:46 <Heffalump> right, time to play with hs-plugins
08:51:49 <shapr> Also, I wish he'd switch to HSQL and/or HaskellDB
08:52:13 <shapr> Though I'm thrilled he's finally turned it into a ghc package, and furnished WashNGo
08:52:58 <shapr> I talked to him about the Zope approach and how it might improve WASH at ICFP03, but I wasn't very clear. :-)
08:54:26 <shapr> autrijus: Do you have a pointer to the docs that say I can disable javascript by commenting out part of the code?
08:56:16 <shapr> Neat stuff in Wheat.
08:59:16 <xerox> foo.hs:66: Only unit numeric type pattern is valid -- hmpf.
08:59:39 <xerox> the code is HaskellTutorial.pdf, page 25
08:59:43 <xerox> lisppaste2, url?
08:59:43 <lisppaste2> To use the lisppaste bot, visit http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell and enter your paste.
09:00:53 <lisppaste2> xerox pasted "66: Only unit numeric type pattern is valid" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/5391
09:01:28 <xerox> the problem is on the line: empty :: d 0
09:01:57 <shapr> The advantage of HaskellWiki is that it has syntax coloring.
09:02:06 <xerox> Yep :-\
09:03:18 <xerox> I can't completely understand, btw.
09:04:01 <shapr> oh, you want a value type!
09:04:14 <xerox> Like Int ?
09:04:26 <shapr> I think that's what you're trying to do with :: d 0
09:04:41 <CosmicRay> shapr: I have started writing my own Python binding.  I could not understand PHI, and I don't use code I can't understand.  :-)
09:04:47 <xerox> In fact it's not me, I copied this code from the book.
09:04:53 <shapr> You should email Brandon, I'm sure he'd like to help.
09:04:56 <CosmicRay> shapr: it is pretty much working, and is a lot simpler than PHI somehow
09:05:08 <shapr> xerox: maybe it's not a zero then?
09:05:11 <CosmicRay> shapr: I have a question, though: what do you think the right way to model Python exceptions in Haskell is?
09:05:17 <xerox> shapr, I cut&pasted :(
09:05:17 <shapr> xerox: the others look like d o instead of d 0
09:05:23 <CosmicRay> shapr: I have thought of my own data object, then raising a Dynamic
09:05:36 <CosmicRay> shapr: or I could just raise some sort of IO excpetion as a string
09:05:59 <xerox> Using empty :: d o it tells:
09:06:02 <xerox> *Foo> let d0 = empty
09:06:02 <xerox> Ambiguous type variables `d', `o' in the top-level constraint:
09:06:02 <xerox>   `Databases d o' arising from use of `empty' at <interactive>:1
09:06:58 <shapr> xerox: I think that's because you haven't specified some of the types.
09:07:26 <shapr> CosmicRay: I don't really know. Brandon had a bunch of ideas about it, he's really the best person to ask.
09:07:33 <CosmicRay> ok
09:07:41 <CosmicRay> he hadn't implemented exception handling yet either
09:07:48 <CosmicRay> maybe I'll see what jvm-bridge does.
09:08:06 <shapr> Reading Ashley's code is always exciting.
09:08:12 <CosmicRay> yes, I discovered that.
09:08:24 <CosmicRay> very unusual build system too.
09:08:24 <shapr> He replaced the Prelude and most (all?) of the standard libraries.
09:08:29 <xerox> Hmm..
09:08:35 <CosmicRay> argh
09:08:39 <Oejet> xerox: Which HaskellTutorial.pdf do you refer to?
09:08:47 <xerox> Oejet, let me find it
09:08:55 <shapr> CosmicRay: because he didn't like the way they were done. So he fixed them.
09:09:06 <xerox> Oejet, http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
09:09:06 <shapr> And of course, he only uses {};
09:09:15 <CosmicRay> yes I noticed that too.
09:09:16 <xerox> Oejet, ftp://ftp.geoinfo.tuwien.ac.at/navratil/HaskellTutorial.pdf
09:09:39 <shapr> CosmicRay: also, it's fun to argue with him.
09:09:52 <CosmicRay> shapr: anyway, I was about to set about writing about half a dozen interfaces to different C libraries.
09:09:57 <shapr> cool!
09:09:58 <Heffalump> anyone installed hs-plugins-0.9.6?
09:10:07 <shapr> Heffalump: I get the nightlies
09:10:10 <CosmicRay> shapr: I decided that was insane.  I'll write one interface to Python, and then interface with the libraries it already has.
09:10:11 <shapr> they're the best.
09:10:39 <shapr> Python interfaces probably won't work as well as haskell-oriented bindings. But it's a nice way to save effort :-)
09:10:43 <CosmicRay> shapr: one other nifty feature is that Python file-like objects can be instances of my HVIO class.
09:10:48 <shapr> hm!
09:10:52 <Heffalump> shapr: ok, have you installed from that?
09:11:07 <shapr> Not in the last two weeks, but before that, yes.
09:11:13 <Heffalump> make install seems to just dump a bunch of .conf.in files in /usr/local/lib/hs-plugins but doesn't turn them into .conf files or rnu ghc-pkg on them
09:11:23 <CosmicRay> shapr: there will undoubtedly be a performance hit.  but to the haskell programmer, the interface can be identical.
09:11:25 <shapr> right, you need make pkg or whatever that is.
09:11:33 <Heffalump> oh.
09:11:37 <CosmicRay> shapr: though where it goes through python straight back to C, I think that hit should be minimal.
09:11:38 <Oejet> xerox: Thanks!
09:11:48 * Heffalump bothers to look at the README file.
09:12:05 <CosmicRay> shapr: python's C api is fairly extensive.  In those cases, I can go straight through without ever having to make it interpret anything
09:12:08 <xerox> Oejet, do you know how to fix it?
09:12:48 <shapr> Maybe you can find a way to read Python bindings and generate FFI?
09:12:55 <shapr> How does swig work?
09:13:04 <CosmicRay> shapr: you mean, "foreign import pycall" or something?
09:13:39 <shapr> Hm, I hadn't thought of that.
09:13:41 <CosmicRay> I am using FFI to import the bits of the Python API that I need
09:13:43 <tromp> i always spend forever trying to correct errors like
09:13:44 <tromp> C4.hs:121: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
09:13:47 <CosmicRay> shapr: I think that requires compiler support
09:14:01 <CosmicRay> shapr: I think I'll have about two dozen functions imported when I'm all done.  Not all that many really.
09:14:16 <tromp> and this is code where layout rules don't apply
09:14:17 <CosmicRay> shapr: the majority of those relate to marshaling data.  The others are used to import things and call things.
09:14:19 <shapr> wxHaskell happened so quickly because Daan wrote a parser for the wxEiffel bindings format. Then he batched them over to Haskell.
09:14:24 <CosmicRay> heh
09:14:54 <CosmicRay> shapr: the thing with Python is that one doesn't need a new foreign binding for each new call to Python code
09:15:19 <CosmicRay> shapr: once you support the Python API calls to import modules and call functions/callables, that's all that's needed
09:15:45 <CosmicRay> shapr: because from then on, everything is dynamic
09:15:51 <CosmicRay> shapr: also python functions have no typing information.
09:16:15 <CosmicRay> shapr: I could probably get a list of them but couldn't generate appropriate Haskell types in an automated fashion.
09:16:46 <CosmicRay> in fact, getting a list of them is trivial with dir()
09:16:58 <shapr> This sounds one or more of {cool,scary,hackish}.
09:17:06 <CosmicRay> heh
09:17:14 <CosmicRay> which, what I've done, or what you're suggesting? :-)
09:17:24 <shapr> What did I suggest?
09:17:35 <CosmicRay> "foreign import python"
09:17:38 <shapr> I was talking about what you are suggesting.
09:17:42 <CosmicRay> ah.
09:17:55 <shapr> I say go for it, see if it works :-)
09:17:57 <CosmicRay> well, what I've done is really the only way to do it.
09:18:06 <CosmicRay> shapr: it does, I have unit tests working already :-)
09:18:10 <shapr> wow
09:18:11 <shapr> ok then!
09:18:34 <shapr> Man, I want to pair program with you, I always get distracted from finishing my neat ideas.
09:18:40 <CosmicRay> hehe
09:18:46 <CosmicRay> you do the same thing to me :-)
09:18:53 <shapr> distract you?
09:19:01 <shapr> haha, I'm a carrier for the ADDisease!
09:19:05 <CosmicRay> yeah, with neat ideas :-)
09:19:07 <CosmicRay> hehe
09:19:14 * shapr infects autrijus 
09:20:15 <CosmicRay> ok, off to go shopping....  thanks for letting me bounce ideas off you, shapr.
09:20:18 <shapr> sure
09:20:23 * CosmicRay AFKs
09:21:38 <shapr> hej ski, wassup?
09:22:05 <Oejet> xerox: I don't even know about your problem.
09:22:38 <xerox> Oejet, mmh, did you try the code'
09:22:40 <xerox> ?
09:23:11 <ski> shapr : hiya
09:23:39 <ski> shapr : testing a little with X apps over the net
09:23:56 <shapr> ah, that's fun
09:23:57 <Oejet> xerox: Just now.  Got the same error. :-P
09:24:15 <ski> shapr : (from bro's comp.  he's installed cygwin and some X server :)
09:24:25 <ski> shapr : yep
09:24:29 <xerox> Oejet, :(
09:24:52 <shapr> xerox: I think you can't just create an empty database without giving more typeinfo
09:25:00 <shapr> it's same for FiniteMap
09:25:22 <Maddas> :-)
09:25:34 <shapr> @type Data.FiniteMap.emptyFM
09:25:35 <lambdabot> Data.FiniteMap.emptyFM :: forall elt key.
09:25:35 <lambdabot> 			  Data.FiniteMap.FiniteMap key elt
09:25:39 <Oejet> Too many parameters for class `Databases'
09:25:40 <Oejet>     (Use -fglasgow-exts to allow multi-parameter classes)
09:26:47 <shapr> Wow, ghci lets me do "> let x = emptyFM"
09:27:05 <shapr> oh, because of the forall
09:27:07 <Lor> You've disabled the monomorphism restriction?
09:27:18 <shapr> x :: forall elt key. FiniteMap key elt
09:27:27 <xerox> Oejet, use that arg.
09:28:05 <Oejet> xerox: I'm using C-c C-l in Emacs.  Can I use that argument from there somehow?
09:28:13 <shapr> :set -fglasgow-exts
09:28:16 <shapr> in ghc
09:28:27 <shapr> err, in ghci
09:29:00 <xerox> Oejet, M-x customize-variable RET haskell-ghci-program-args RET
09:29:03 <Oejet> shapr: Thank you very much.  It worked.
09:29:19 <Oejet> xerox: Now it compiles.
09:29:35 <Oejet> xerox: Wait...
09:29:37 <xerox> It does, try let d0 = empty
09:30:09 <shapr> xerox: what about let d0 = empty :: (DBS Object) 
09:30:27 <xerox> It works!
09:30:37 <lisppaste2> Oejet annotated #5391 with "Correction." at http://paste.lisp.org/display/5391#1
09:30:58 <Oejet> Oh, too late. :-P
09:31:49 <shapr> xerox: when your type has a bunch of stuff to fill in, sometimes it can't fill it in by itself. For example, the type of (+) only requires an instance of the Num typeclass.
09:31:50 <xerox> shapr, why that, btw?
09:32:03 <xerox> Hmm, okay
09:32:08 <shapr> When you type 1 + 1 into ghci, what is the type of that 1?
09:32:58 <shapr> It's anything in the Num typeclass, and that a lot of different values. 1 + 1 used to give that same error in GHCi, until 'type defaulting' was added to GHCi
09:33:05 <xerox> It says Num a => a
09:33:26 <shapr> Right, so, what are the instances of Num in scope? Lots!
09:33:35 <xerox> Yep!
09:34:12 <shapr> So you asked it an incomplete question. It couldn't infer a type from other source code in the same file, because there was only that lonely let.
09:35:49 <xerox> I first have to understand the code, eheh, btw I think I understood what you mean.
09:41:38 <autrijus> rehi.
09:44:00 <ski> hi autrijus
09:57:35 <syntax_syntax> this is really offtopic, but do you know a readymade free-ish PHP+MySQL system for administrating libraries?
09:57:40 <syntax_syntax> google's not being my friend.
10:37:20 <KrispyKringle> syntax_syntax: try freshmeat?
11:53:21 * ski tries to prove  subst :: forall a,b :: *, a0,a1 :: a, f :: a -> b. a0 = a1 -> f a0 = f a1  in alfa
11:58:31 <basti_> thats congruence =)
12:01:45 <Asta> Ah!
12:01:49 <Lor> Mm, not really.
12:01:52 <Asta> grrr
12:02:07 * jadrian should change his irc settings
12:02:32 <jadrian> I just read Adrian Hey message to haskell mailing list
12:02:39 <jadrian> very interesting
12:02:49 <ski> basti_ : 'tis ?
12:03:06 <basti_> ski i think so yes. but i dont know how that could help.
12:03:47 <Lor> I think a congruence rule is of the form x -> f x, where x occurs exactly once in f x.
12:03:57 <basti_> o0
12:04:13 <ski> basti_ : anyway, i defined a leibniz-like equality
12:04:32 <ski> refl,symm,trans is easy to define
12:04:39 <Lor> That's meta notation, of course.
12:05:08 <basti_> ski: and then?
12:05:27 <basti_> did you inherit these properties?
12:05:27 <ski> then i need (what i called) subst
12:05:36 <ski> which ?
12:05:39 <ski> refl, .. ?
12:05:41 <basti_> yes
12:05:46 <ski> i defined refl, ...
12:05:53 <_Codex> ski: isn't that just that f needs to be mono?
12:07:04 <ski> _Codex : 'tis not a property of 'f', 'tis a property of '=' !
12:07:58 <Lor> ski, instantiate the leibniz equality with property \x. f x = f a1 -> f a0 = f a1
12:08:40 <jadrian> I learned that a congruence is an equiv relation in a pair set/opeartion (S,*), such that  a~a' and b~b' then a*b ~ a'*b' 
12:08:44 <Lor> then you get (f a0 = f a1 -> f a0 = f a1) -> (f a1 = f a1 -> f a0 = f a1)
12:09:51 <jadrian> f is not binary, but it's pretty close to that definition...
12:10:20 <Lor> That's one form of congruence.
12:10:43 <Lor> No, um, sorry. Probably all forms of congruence are like that.
12:14:11 <Lor> Um, silly me. It's enough to instantiate the leibniz equality with \x. f a0 = f ax
12:19:34 <ski_> hm
12:20:23 <Lor> f a0 = f x, that is.
12:20:33 <ski_> 'instantiate', how ?
12:20:42 <Lor> Apply it to.
12:21:34 <Lor> you define "a = b" as "forall p. p a -> p b", right?
12:22:36 <ski_> almost
12:22:45 <ski_> i have both directions
12:22:54 <ski_> (not sure if strictly necessary)
12:23:09 <Lor> It's not.
12:23:38 <ski_> oki
12:28:58 <ski_> ah
12:29:04 <ski_> now it seems to work
12:29:36 <Lor> \a b. \eqab :: (forall p. p a -> p b). \q. \qa :: q a. eqab (\x. q x -> q a) (\i :: q a. i)
12:29:51 <ski_> ( subst a0 a1 f = \a0_a1 p -> a0_a1 (\a -> p (f a)) )
12:30:46 <Lor> Ah, right, that's the direct way.
12:31:07 <ski_> what's your q,qa ?
12:31:48 <Lor> the type of the whole thing is forall a b. (forall p. p a -> p b) -> (forall q. q a -> q b)
12:31:51 <ski_> (a |-> a0,b |-> a1,eqab |-> a0_a1)
12:32:05 <Lor> Sorry, (forall q. q b -> q a)
12:32:17 <Lor> The point was just that the other direction can be derived.
12:32:21 <ski_> aha
12:32:22 <ski_> sorry
12:32:42 <ski_> that would be impl. for one-sided symm, then
12:33:11 <Lor> "impl." ?
12:33:18 <Lor> implementation, right.
12:33:34 <Lor> (Why not say "proof"? :)
12:33:47 <ski_> same, yes
12:33:59 <Lor> Easier to pronounce. :)
12:34:07 <ski> heh
12:34:32 * ski is trying to play around a little with category theory in alfa
12:35:09 <ski> so i needed some equality ..
12:35:13 <Lor> The last time I tried alfa (years ago) it didn't have dependent data types. the gadt stuff of ghc.
12:35:20 <ski> hm
12:35:33 <Lor> That's why I ended up using coq, even though alfa's interface was mighty cool.
12:35:55 * ski recently wondered if GADT enables non-parametric functions ..
12:35:59 <ski> ok
12:36:07 * ski haven't tried coq, yet
12:36:43 <ski> (parametric as in parametricity and naturality conditions of natural transformations ..)
12:36:56 * ski must go and eat ..
12:38:57 <Lor> I think it does.
12:39:18 <Lor> Wonder what the implications are.
13:01:13 <jadrian> what is alfa? proof assistant?
13:06:05 <ski> mm
13:36:08 <boegel> heya
13:36:42 <timbod> Hi boegel
13:48:15 * ski doesn't really understand the universes in alfa (Set,Type,Kind,etc ..) :(
13:50:54 <ne1> stratified type system, looks like.
13:51:21 <ski> mm
13:51:29 <ski> but how's it conneced
13:51:33 <ski> connected
13:52:23 <boegel> has anybody here ever heard of the name Eric Verhulst ?
13:52:57 <shapr> sounds familiar
13:55:48 <shapr> Heh, I just had a funny antispam idea. Put XML Schema information into your DNS records for your email, stuff like "my email server only sends emails at two minutes after the hour." Then fake emails are easy to spot.
13:57:23 <shapr> hiya ex_nor, what's up?
14:02:51 <KrispyKringle> shapr: i think there's a better solution than that. it's called SPF :P
14:03:05 <shapr> I was thinking of cheesy extensions to SPF
14:03:06 <KrispyKringle> but both your idea and SPF rely on universal adoption. Until then, it's SpamAssassin for me. 
14:03:09 <KrispyKringle> hehe
14:03:29 <shapr> SPF doesn't rely on universal adoption, it allows partial use.
14:03:42 <shapr> Some of my other anti-spam ideas do require universal adoption.
14:03:52 <timbod> How 
14:04:05 <timbod> does spf work (in one line or less)?
14:04:19 <shapr> legal mail origin info in DNS
14:04:34 <KrispyKringle> shapr: no, true, but it's not much of a solution until it's widely adopted. 
14:04:43 <shapr> I think that was even less than one line.
14:04:53 <KrispyKringle> because you can either a) blacklist anyone not using SPF (bad) or b) filter out only the spammers dumb enough to claim to be from an SPF-using domain. 
14:06:55 <KrispyKringle> there's a demo of SPF on the pobox.com website. It allows you to create a custom SPF record. 
14:08:18 <shapr> I think push systems will always have spam.
14:09:34 <shapr> The problem I see with email is that the system bears the cost of delivery.
14:10:11 <ne1> All socialist systems have this problem.
14:10:17 * ne1 ducks
14:10:42 <KrispyKringle> shapr: there've been those proposals to do micropayments per transaction, of course, but i think they're stupid.
14:10:53 <shapr> I think that's the wrong approach.
14:11:01 * boegel swings his stick at ne1's head, but misses
14:11:20 <ne1> heh heh heh
14:11:50 <shapr> My best idea so far has been to keep emails on the sending computer (or their ISP) and only send out notifications.
14:12:01 <KrispyKringle> shapr: i do, too. i was just saying. 
14:12:02 <xerox> goodnight folks
14:12:08 <shapr> g'night xerox 
14:12:12 <boegel> g'night
14:12:15 <KrispyKringle> shapr: how does that help? i'd still have my mailserver accept mail from people i haven't heard of. 
14:12:26 <shapr> hoi jyp 
14:12:30 <jyp> hoi
14:12:33 <boegel> shapr: they have a nice system here at our uni
14:12:41 <boegel> I don't get any spam anymore
14:12:48 <boegel> without whitelisting or shit like that
14:13:03 <shapr> KrispyKringle: your mailserver wouldn't do mail, only notifications.
14:13:08 <KrispyKringle> what's the system, boegel ?
14:13:13 <shapr> Your client would do mail.
14:13:18 <KrispyKringle> shapr: right, but then when it recieves a notification, iw ould have to choose to recieve it, right?
14:13:37 <KrispyKringle> how would i do that any better than i can decide now--during the SMTP session--whether i want to accept the mail?
14:13:43 <shapr> No, you wouldn't. Your client could do much of the checking automatically.
14:13:45 <boegel> KrispyKringle: every mail the get on the server, they send a 're-send' message to that server
14:13:59 <jyp> Is it just me or debian-testing-emacs-haskell-mode is broken ?
14:14:03 <boegel> any normal server re-sends the mail, any spam server just ignores it, becauses it's not worth the effort
14:14:15 <KrispyKringle> boegel: greylisting, i know. 
14:14:15 <ne1> Hah boegel, that's clever
14:14:18 <shapr> jyp: haskell-mode 2.0 works
14:14:35 <shapr> KrispyKringle: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/antispamserver.html
14:14:42 <boegel> is that called greylisting ?
14:14:57 <KrispyKringle> boegel: yep. it's implemented already :P
14:15:01 <KrispyKringle> i use it ;)
14:15:01 <boegel> well, whatever it's called, it works
14:15:08 <boegel> but I think it won't work forever
14:15:23 <KrispyKringle> i wouldn't know. most of the spam mail i receive i receive from servers i don't run, so i can't greylist. 
14:15:26 <KrispyKringle> damn .forwards. 
14:15:28 <boegel> when every erver uses it, spam-server _will_ take the effort
14:15:47 <KrispyKringle> probably true. 
14:15:48 <jyp> shapr, thanks for the info ... Maybe it's only xemacs; or my setup that is messed up
14:15:49 <ne1> I think it will work as long as the world is full of other people who don't use this scheme.  This means practically forever.
14:16:09 <shapr> jyp: I had to switch to gnumacs recently because xemacs was causing me too many problems. You know about Yi?
14:16:56 <shapr> Yi is an editor written in Haskell. It's still in the beginnig stages, but it's neat.
14:17:18 <jyp> I tried to try it out the other month...
14:17:24 <shapr> It does vim, and could do some emacs if I'd get around to doing the emacs keybindings.
14:17:52 <timbod> is yi actually usable yet?
14:17:58 <boegel> shapr: what about Monad Reader ? any progress ?
14:18:00 <shapr> If you use vim, yeah.
14:18:12 <jyp> Unfortunately I cannot do without emacs bindings for now
14:18:16 <shapr> boegel: no, I haven't moved my server yet. You want to write a monthly column, yeah?
14:18:27 * shapr grins
14:18:33 <boegel> shapr: I dunno :)
14:18:44 <boegel> I don't know if I'm skilled enough to do so
14:18:47 <shapr> I need more authors of The Monad.Reader is to be decent.
14:18:52 <shapr> "if"
14:18:53 <boegel> or if my English is good enough :)
14:19:05 <shapr> I'll be your editor.
14:19:09 <boegel> nice
14:19:30 <timbod> on yi... about 6 years ago I switched my fingers from vi keys to emacs keys, going back would be hard.
14:19:46 <shapr> It's easy to change keybindings in Yi, once you understand the syntax.
14:19:48 * boegel tries to find a subject
14:20:03 <shapr> But I want to write a keybindings tutorial as part the production of the Emacs bindings.
14:20:21 <shapr> Then people can easily make whatever bindings they want.
14:20:33 <shapr> KrispyKringle: what do you think of that antispam proposal?
14:20:45 <KrispyKringle> shapr: i get it now. 
14:20:48 <KrispyKringle> it's fairly reasonable. 
14:21:05 <shapr> see any holes?
14:21:05 <timbod> shapr, are you working on emacs bindings?
14:21:07 <KrispyKringle> you're goal is not to eliminate spam, but rather eliminate the cost of spam for the victims, right?
14:21:13 <shapr> right
14:21:20 <KrispyKringle> i think in that regard it's reasonabl;e. 
14:21:25 <shapr> timbod: not at this moment, but that task has been assigned to me.
14:21:41 <KrispyKringle> since i don't pay for my own bandwidth, i don't really care--i only care about the screen-space in my mailbox, which this may not help much. 
14:21:56 <shapr> Do you care about your relatives receiving spam?
14:21:59 <KrispyKringle> but it would probably take some burden off the isps. 
14:22:13 <shapr> I actually know people third-hand who spent money to buy stuff from spam-mails :-(
14:22:13 <timbod> other that "implemented in haskell" coolness, do you see any benefits over other editors?
14:22:50 <shapr> timbod: yes, multithreading, parse tree macros, and other stuff I can't think of at the moment.
14:23:25 <shapr> I do pay for my own bandwidth.
14:23:55 <timbod> by parse tree macros, do you mean the ability to edit code working on the AST?
14:24:01 <shapr> yup
14:24:23 <timbod> cool (though a C++ parser might be a long way down the track)
14:24:39 <shapr> That part isn't done, but the syntax highlighting should be based on the parser as well, so...
14:25:23 <jyp> You certainly don't want to do a *real* C++ parser
14:25:38 <shapr> Well, I hope I can get around it by getting someone to do it for me ;-)
14:25:42 <shapr> well, for dons 
14:25:46 <shapr> he's the Yi guy.
14:25:56 <timbod> It will be interesting to see how it pans out. There aren't many haskell apps out there being developed by distributed groups (only droundy's darcs comes to mind).
14:26:10 <shapr> I'd like to have something like visual-re in emacs.
14:26:12 <jyp> what I mean is you'll want to do a parser for a "mock C++" language
14:26:26 <shapr> Where you define the parser in one window, and see how it works on demo source in the other window.
14:26:26 <jyp> C++ is just too f* up
14:26:44 <timbod> jyp: you don't want a normal parser anyway, because it needs to preserve whitespace comments etc
14:26:53 <shapr> Something vaguely like the epigram interface.
14:27:34 <shapr> So many ideas, so little working code ;-)
14:27:34 <timbod> c++ might be f* up, but I don't believe there's another language that can compete it it's niche at present.
14:29:01 <jyp> timbod, no offense intended against the language... It's just that a full parser for C++ is just too complicated for such an application
14:29:31 <timbod> agreed.
14:29:55 * ski groans
14:30:25 <shapr> ski: C++ talk making you sick?
14:30:32 <ski> not that
14:30:38 <ski> alfa
14:30:41 <shapr> oh
14:30:42 <ne1> haha
14:31:06 <KrispyKringle> shapr: spam statistics for my mailbox for today... :P
14:31:14 <KrispyKringle> rejected: 29
14:31:14 <KrispyKringle> spam: 38
14:31:14 <KrispyKringle> total: 153
14:31:16 <ski> i can define 4 variants of Equals, and none of them seem to work in all cases i want it to work
14:31:34 <ski> (for some kind of dimension errors i don't understand)
14:32:03 <ski> (4 variants for combinations of Set/Type)
14:32:20 <boegel> shapr: which GUI library does Yi use ?
14:32:25 <tuomov> I have very little trust in reaching anyone by email anymore, thanks to all kinds of spam filters at every step
14:32:59 <tuomov> the solution to spam should incorporate some kind of 'accepted into mbox' replies
14:33:03 <shapr> boegel: ncurses at the moment, but the gui is pluggable.
14:33:27 <shapr> KrispyKringle: I run four domains and my own email server, I drop a *huge* number of emails.
14:34:26 <shapr> I've been thinking of switching to postmaster, the Haskell MTA.
14:34:27 <tuomov> spam today: ~100
14:34:44 <tuomov> mailing list posts: 4
14:34:50 <tuomov> other: 1
14:34:58 <shapr> It's absolutely fascist in its quest for correctness of submitted emails.
14:35:05 <KrispyKringle> shapr: there's a haskell mta? hmm. i use postfix and im quite happy with it. 
14:35:15 <shapr> I used postfix too, but I still get email!
14:35:19 <tuomov> (I read other mailing lists besides the ion list through gmane/nntp.)
14:35:20 <shapr> er "use"
14:35:28 <KrispyKringle> see, i don't like that. qmail has that antispam setting, too, but it blocks some isps. 
14:35:40 <shapr> My goal is to not get any email, ever.
14:35:48 <shapr> I want a pull system :-/
14:35:58 <timbod> I hadn't heard of postmaster, but I like this quote on the site: "Postmaster is the mail transport agent of choice for the discriminating hacker. Or, to be more accurate: for the discriminating Haskell hacker, because if you don't know any Haskell, you have about zero chance of running this software right now."
14:35:59 <KrispyKringle> i prefer mda-based filtering--i blacklist domains known-bad and certain subject lines (like "st0ck"), use spamassassin and razor2, and only get a few spams through a day. 
14:36:04 <KrispyKringle> hahaha
14:36:07 <tuomov> pull might solve some problems
14:36:17 <KrispyKringle> timbod: that's evil
14:36:27 <shapr> KrispyKringle: it shouldn't be that much work to get mail from mom.
14:37:04 <shapr> Postmaster is way nifty.
14:37:11 <tuomov> I've been getting lots of empty spam messages through lately
14:37:21 <shapr> Those are bounce checks.
14:37:23 <tuomov> others are filtered quite well by bogofilter+sa
14:37:34 <tuomov> (the mail server is too ancient to run bayesian sa)
14:37:52 <shapr> Empty spams work like nmap your spam system.
14:38:06 <boegel> tuomov: I get a lot of empty messages too... what's the whole idea there?
14:44:55 <Oejet> I get an error compiling GHC from CVS:
14:45:09 <Oejet> Compat/Directory.hs:24: ../../includes/ghcconfig.h: No such file or directory
14:45:42 <Oejet> Where do I start looking for a solution?
14:47:26 <boegel> Oejet, check if the file exists ?
14:47:31 <boegel> and where it is
14:47:48 <boegel> then check how you can adjust the path without causing any more problems...
14:51:34 <Oejet> boegel: Thanks.  Changed a hardcoded path in ghc/lib/compat/Compat/Directory.hs
14:52:28 <Oejet> Changed one more in ghc/lib/compat/Compat/RawSystem.hs
14:52:57 <boegel> me advice actually helped ? :)
14:53:04 <Oejet> Yes!
14:53:29 <Oejet> Main.hs:21:45:
14:53:29 <Oejet>     Module `Distribution.ParseUtils' does not export `ParseResult(..)'
14:54:08 * Oejet has the feeling that he is debugging GHC.
14:54:32 <jyp> I added a piece of essential information to the yi wiki :P
14:55:01 <shapr> jyp: that is essential.
14:55:21 <shapr> wow cool, you got the Yi char into the wiki as text!
14:55:42 <jyp> heh ;)
14:55:57 <shapr> Any clue how you say that in chinese?
14:56:08 <jyp> Yi ;)
14:56:16 * shapr sniggers
14:56:27 <shapr> ask a stupid question...
14:56:53 <boegel> Oejet, are you sure you have the right build ?
14:57:08 <Oejet> boegel: I have just checked out from CVS.
14:57:09 * shapr has a muscular build...
14:57:42 <shapr> I'm skipping school tomorrow so I can work! Is that sick or what?
14:57:55 <jyp> For the tone... I think it is a low one in cantonese.
14:58:04 <shapr> jyp: what sort of code do you work on?
14:58:16 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym 
14:58:20 <Pseudonym> G'day.
14:58:36 * Pseudonym thinks either shapr is a quick typist or he has a macro for all of the regulars
14:58:43 <shapr> :-P
14:58:52 <shapr> I don't have any macros.
14:59:12 <Pseudonym> I have the "generate Haskell example" macro.
14:59:15 <jyp> shapr, no haskell for now.
14:59:59 <jyp> been toying with my portable mp3 player lately.
15:00:11 <Pseudonym> Has anyone here played with SCons?
15:00:26 <shapr> I think Igloo tried it. Have you seen maak/
15:00:27 <shapr> ?
15:00:32 <Pseudonym> Nope/
15:00:33 <shapr> jyp: what flavor?
15:00:46 <shapr> Pseudonym: sure, make fun of my dvorak mistakes, I don't mind...
15:00:47 <ozone> Pseudonym: i haven't played it, but i have a number of friends who have, and they love it
15:00:59 <ozone> mind you, they're coming from autogoat, so they'll probably love anything ...
15:01:03 <shapr> Pseudonym: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/maak-trunk.tar.bz2
15:01:06 <Pseudonym> True.
15:01:06 <ozone> played with it, rather
15:01:16 <Igloo> I don't think I ever tried scons as it didn't look perfect
15:01:23 <shapr> oh
15:01:24 <Pseudonym> Well I'm thinking of porting a project over from a combination of GNU autotools with a separate build system for MS Visual Studio.
15:01:30 <Igloo> And I'd want perfect to defeat ubiquitous
15:01:40 <shapr> Have you looked at maak?
15:01:52 <Pseudonym> So actually, imperfect but portable would be better for this project.
15:02:04 <shapr> Maak fulfills my definition of perfect, with the only flaw that the author hasn't worked on it in more than two years.
15:02:04 <jyp> shapr, Archos Gmini 120. Mostly reverse engineering & building tools upto now
15:02:13 <Igloo> make is certainly not perfect, and ubiquitous > portable  :-)
15:02:15 <Pseudonym> That fails my test of perfect.
15:02:16 <ozone> Pseudonym: scons for windows is nice, from what i've heard.  simple self-installing executable.  depends if you really want visual studio support, really
15:02:20 <Pseudonym> Unmaintained is imperfect.
15:02:39 <shapr> Maak is written in Haskell and based on DAGs. I really like that.
15:02:55 <Pseudonym> Even TeX is maintained, even though there hasn't been a change in years.
15:05:10 <Pseudonym> Well, surely all make-like tools are based on DAGs. :-)
15:05:35 <shapr> Question is, how many of them are aware of it?
15:06:07 <ozone> probably all of them, i'd say
15:06:17 <shapr> jyp: I'd like to buy a flac/ogg player. Any idea if there's one that can survive flying off a unicycle in the mountains?
15:06:48 <jyp> shapr, go for a diskless model then
15:06:51 <shapr> ozone: sucker question, I asked a Python build tool author if he was using DAGs explicitly and he said he wasn't using anything technical.
15:07:57 * Pseudonym shudders
15:08:02 <Cale> heh
15:08:11 * shapr asks google for diskless flac/ogg players.
15:08:17 <SyntaxNinja> hi all
15:08:18 <Oejet> How can it say that ParseUtils does not export ParseResult, when infact ./libraries/Cabal/Distribution/ParseUtils.hs export it?
15:08:21 <Pseudonym> If you don't know what a topological sort is, you have no business writitng anything that involves dependencies.
15:08:28 <Pseudonym> Apache 2 gets it wrong, too.
15:08:35 <Pseudonym> You can specify dependencies between modules.
15:08:42 <Pseudonym> But they don't do a topological sort.
15:08:52 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: what says that "it does not export ParseResult"?
15:08:59 <Pseudonym> Instead, they consult the order in which they were declared, and if the dependencies aren't satisfied, that's an error.
15:09:16 * Pseudonym brought this up during a seminar by Ryan in 2000-ish
15:09:27 <boegel> I'm going to bed, so i can finally do some work tomorrow...
15:09:31 <shapr> g'night boegel 
15:09:33 <Oejet> SyntaxNinja: Main.hs:21:45:
15:09:33 <Oejet>     Module `Distribution.ParseUtils' does not export `ParseResult(..)'
15:09:34 <Pseudonym> He plead ignorance.
15:09:41 <boegel> I haven't done sh*t this weekend, and that's no good
15:09:43 <shapr> ignorance of topo sort?
15:09:45 <Oejet> When compiling GHC from CVS.
15:09:57 <Pseudonym> Ryan Bloom, that is.
15:10:15 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: what is Main.hs?
15:10:42 <Oejet> I think it's ./ghc/utils/ghc-pkg/Main.hs
15:10:58 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: I saw a commit a few minutes ago that was "fixed" just a few minutes later; do you have that "fix" commit in the libraries?
15:12:46 <Oejet> Bleeeeeding edge.
15:13:27 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: yeah, I'm a little worried that the big commit I'm about to do will break head; I'm really unclear about what all depends on cabal at this point
15:14:08 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: but I have no idea why you'd be getting that error if it does indeed export it, you might try cleaning up a few object files
15:14:33 <Oejet> make clean?
15:14:36 <SyntaxNinja> one of these days I should just break down and spend a week building head or something
15:14:40 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: I wouldn't get that drastic ;)
15:14:48 <shapr> I think I need to rebuild my head.
15:15:02 <Oejet> shapr: :-P
15:15:09 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: remove main.o and ParseUtils.o
15:15:11 <SyntaxNinja> and hi
15:15:43 <shapr> hoi kuribas 
15:18:48 <jyp> Good night all.
15:18:56 <shapr> g'night
15:19:05 <Pseudonym> Night.
15:24:07 <kuribas> shapr: hi
15:24:30 <shapr> Man, I want a cool Haskell software of the day blog.
15:25:09 <shapr> Anyone know of nifty Haskell code that I might not know about?
15:25:18 <Pseudonym> If you don't have enough to fill a blog...
15:25:31 <Pseudonym> Well, there's wli's fibonacci number generator. :-)
15:25:36 <shapr> hm, good idea.
15:25:47 <shapr> I do have enough to fill a blog, but since I wrote it, it's not so interesting to me.
15:25:54 * Heffalump appears
15:25:59 <shapr> poof!
15:26:05 * Heffalump knows of some nifty Haskell code shapr doesn't know about.
15:26:09 * Pseudonym is having flashbacks now
15:26:09 <shapr> oh oh tell me!
15:26:10 <shapr> oooh
15:26:13 <Heffalump> But I'm not telling until I finish it :-)
15:26:16 <shapr> oh ok
15:26:18 <Pseudonym> My daughter is a serious Winnie the Pooh fan.
15:26:19 * shapr waits impatiently
15:26:24 <shapr> There's a new Pooh movie.
15:26:30 <Oejet> SyntaxNinja: Do you take patches?
15:26:32 <Pseudonym> "Heffalump appears" brings back memories.
15:26:37 <Pseudonym> shapr: Yes, but it's not out in Oz yet.
15:26:45 <Heffalump> now, if you can tell me how to run random code and kill it off if it takes too long, this would help a lot
15:26:48 <Heffalump> it's not out here yet either
15:26:51 <shapr> We have lotsa advertisement in the local theaters. Not out here either. But they call them "Heffaklumps" in swedish.
15:26:54 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: to what?
15:26:59 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: to cabal, of course
15:27:04 * Pseudonym starts a "My killer app isn't ready yet" blog
15:27:11 <shapr> Heffalump: use until
15:27:23 <Heffalump> what module is that in?
15:27:27 <shapr> @type until
15:27:29 <lambdabot> until :: forall a. (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
15:28:01 <Heffalump> errm, IM _random_ code.
15:28:16 <Heffalump> That someone else wrote. That might maliciously do something like 'let loop = loop in loop'
15:28:20 <shapr> oh
15:28:43 <Heffalump> (if you can tell me how to get hs-plugins to stop it importing stuff so it can't use unsafePerformIO, that'd help too, but I have a sort of idea for that one)
15:28:52 <Oejet>  SyntaxNinja: Oejet: remove main.o and ParseUtils.o.  There are no such files yet.
15:29:00 <shapr> I think you can still do it, but I don't know if you can do it without hacking the scheduler. I know hOp did something like that so that interrupts wouldn't overflow.
15:29:16 <shapr> Oh I like this code already :-)
15:29:47 <shapr> Heffalump: I can guess what you're doing, but I look forward to the final version.
15:29:54 <Heffalump> what do you think I'm doing?
15:30:06 <Heffalump> the problem is that the pre-emptive scheduler only pre-empts on memory allocation.
15:30:07 <Pseudonym> I think you're wasting time on IRC when you could be writing cool code.
15:30:08 <shapr> I think you're making an @eval that's real Haskell.
15:30:14 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: I don't understand
15:30:15 <Heffalump> you're wrong :-)
15:30:20 <shapr> well, something like that.
15:30:30 <Heffalump> though what I'm doing could be adapted to that, I guess.
15:30:44 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: well, if noone can help with my problem, then I'm wasting time :-)
15:30:48 <Pseudonym> :-)
15:31:07 <shapr> I don't think you can do it if you turn on -fglasgow-exts
15:31:35 <shapr> unsafePerformIO, unsafeCoerce, etc can still be used to get around any "don't do IO properties" you put in place.
15:31:43 <Oejet> SyntaxNinja: I am trying to build GHC from CVS but it gives me lots of errors.  Is that usual?
15:31:54 <Heffalump> shapr: not if I ban imports
15:32:11 <Heffalump> I'm using hs-plugins' makeWith thingy, which will need a bit of hackery to not merge import statements
15:32:15 <Heffalump> but should be possible
15:32:19 <shapr> hm, neat.
15:32:35 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: I don't think so; are you sure you followed all the steps to build?  if there's no ParseUtils.o, and it's trying to build Main.hs, then that's a problem.
15:32:35 <Heffalump> btw, is it known that hs-plugins 0.9.6 can't load from things defined in hierarchical modules? 
15:32:44 <shapr> Derek Elkins may still be able to break it :-)
15:32:49 <dons> Heffalump: yep. please use the cvs version :)
15:32:55 <Heffalump> oh, hi :-)
15:32:56 <shapr> dons: you're back!
15:33:00 <Heffalump> nice timing :-)
15:33:06 <dons> yep! a few hours ago
15:33:09 <Oejet> ]cvs checkout fpconfig
15:33:11 <Heffalump> cvs version = the snapshot on the webpage?
15:33:13 <shapr> How the island and the french?
15:33:16 <Oejet> ]cd fptools
15:33:21 <Oejet> ]cvs checkout ghc hslibs libraries
15:33:29 <Oejet> ]autoreconf
15:33:36 <Oejet> ]configure

15:34:13 <Heffalump> ta
15:34:21 <dons> shapr: nouville-caledonie is great. hot, aqua sea, coconuts, patisseries ..
15:34:28 <shapr> mmm
15:34:55 <dons> Oejet: last night's cvs ghc builds fine for me
15:35:16 <shapr> Should ghc from portage work on freebsd 5?
15:35:32 <Oejet> Is "autoreconf" correct?
15:35:44 <dons> Heffalump: you making an eval function?
15:35:55 <Heffalump> dons: I guess I am, yeah.
15:36:02 <Heffalump> though it was intended for a fairly specific purpose :-)
15:36:17 <dons> you could look at hs-plugins/examples/hmake/one-shot
15:36:26 <dons> that is a haskell interpreter designed for irc use
15:36:48 <dons> it terminates evalutation after a number of seconds, and restricts imports
15:37:03 <dons> (so no IO, for example)
15:37:36 <Heffalump> if you do it by setting resource limits, does that mean your calling program doesn't regain control if it times out?
15:38:25 <dons> I don't quite understand. the 'runplugs' program terminates with an exit status, that's all
15:38:42 <dons> so the 'calling' program just runs it over a popen-style call
15:38:46 <Heffalump> oh, right.
15:38:56 <dons> i've got a modified lambdabot to run it this way
15:39:03 <Heffalump> I guess I could do that, but then I'd have to parse the output.
15:39:26 <dons> yep. not an issue for irc (just dump the string)
15:40:13 <Heffalump> right
15:41:19 <Heffalump> any chance of/would you accept patches for a makeWith that restricted imports too?
15:41:36 <dons> sure
15:41:48 <dons> makeWithR or something
15:41:50 <SyntaxNinja> Oejet: sorry, I don't know what's wrong with that ubild
15:43:33 <Oejet> Good night, and thanks for the help SyntaxNinja and dons and boegel (who has gone to bed).
16:32:19 <Pseudonym> Grrrr.
17:03:58 * CosmicRay returns
17:51:28 * shapr throw cosmic particles.
18:01:16 <CosmicRay> yay, cosmic particles!
18:02:25 <shapr> What sort of chaos will it require to get Haskell's Char and String types UTF-8 in GHC?
18:02:39 <CosmicRay> you mean wrt I/O?
18:02:54 <shapr> I want to use UTF-8 in buffers, I want full UTF-8 support, etc.
18:02:56 <CosmicRay> they're already wide enough to store unicode characters, and I guess sometimes do.
18:03:21 <CosmicRay> really you probably want utf32 internally, rather than utf8, no?
18:03:29 <CosmicRay> so that one unicode character is one Char, always?
18:03:32 <shapr> oh, maybe so.
18:03:37 <CosmicRay> haskell does that already
18:03:43 <CosmicRay> Char is 32 bits
18:03:55 <shapr> Ok, now I want to use any unicode char in my source.
18:03:59 <CosmicRay> ah.
18:04:04 <shapr> Hah, my demands never end!
18:04:12 <CosmicRay> afaik that's not supported anywhere yet
18:04:18 <CosmicRay> I *think* I remember reading that somewhere
18:04:25 <shapr> Yeah, I think that's true.
18:04:30 <shapr> sucks though.
18:04:44 <CosmicRay> yeah the whole unicode situation in haskell sucks at the moment
18:05:02 <CosmicRay> but then, it does in most languages.
18:05:10 <CosmicRay> charsets are messy everywhere
18:05:15 <CosmicRay> just slightly messier here
18:05:51 <Lemmih> Good morning, #haskell!
18:05:58 <CosmicRay> good evening, Lemmih
18:05:59 <shapr> Hopefully it'll get better. Lots of interested people.
18:06:05 <shapr> Good afternoon Lemmih.
18:06:07 * CosmicRay obstinately persists in using central standard time
18:06:23 * shapr is on Pineal Time
18:06:24 <CosmicRay> afternoon?
18:06:28 <CosmicRay> heh
18:06:30 * CosmicRay doesn't ask
18:06:35 * shapr snickers
18:07:04 <Lemmih> Hardware problems are _so_ annoying /-:
18:07:09 <CosmicRay> I agree.
18:07:28 <CosmicRay> I especially hate printers, motherboards, cpu, drives, keyboards, mice, screens, scanners, and speakers.
18:07:32 <CosmicRay> but especially printers.
18:08:01 <shapr> Postscript printers with their own ethernet are okay.
18:08:10 <CosmicRay> if your tasks are simple.
18:08:18 <Lemmih> My nVidia openGL driver is totally broken. Everything that links to libGL segfaults at once /-:
18:08:28 <shapr> nvidia suxx
18:08:28 <CosmicRay> if you decide you want to print from a specific tray, or use an odd size of paper, or use the hole punch or stapling feature, or...
18:08:37 <shapr> Lemmih: using debian?
18:09:04 <Lemmih> shapr: Dual boot with Gentoo and Debian.
18:09:48 <shapr> I can help you with debian. Dunno about Gentoo
18:10:03 <Lemmih> I've also been looking at GoboLinux lately.
18:10:21 * Lemmih reboots to Debian.
18:10:50 <CosmicRay> one less gentoo boot, the world is a better place :-)
18:10:52 * CosmicRay hides
18:11:04 <shapr> I wish my sense of urgency were constant over a 24 hour period.
18:11:06 * shapr grumbles
18:11:16 <CosmicRay> ikwym
18:12:15 * CosmicRay writes unit tests for al <-> dict conversions
18:12:24 <shapr> al?
18:12:28 <CosmicRay> association lists
18:12:36 <shapr> Have you tried QuickCheck?
18:12:55 <CosmicRay> is that the one that is supposed to invent unit tests for you?
18:13:01 <shapr> um, sort of..
18:13:10 <CosmicRay> I think I looked at it once
18:13:13 <CosmicRay> I'm happy with hunit
18:14:08 <shapr> Well, next time you want to play with something really cool, I suggest QuickCheck.
18:14:17 * CosmicRay duly notes this
18:14:27 <shapr> I would show you some demo tests, but I know it'll distract you from useful work.
18:14:35 <CosmicRay> indeed
18:14:40 <jesse99> but can you do TDD with quickcheck?
18:14:44 <CosmicRay> I believe I have all of the basic communication with python working
18:14:53 <shapr> jesse99: yes, you can.
18:15:01 <CosmicRay> shapr: fwiw, the method of invoking python functions I described is the only one the Python API permits
18:15:14 <shapr> I hacked QuickCheck to save failing test cases and save them for future runs.
18:15:18 <CosmicRay> shapr: well, I suppose one could make it eval arbitrary python code that does the same thing, but that's uglier
18:15:38 <shapr> I also submitted that code to the QuickCheck2 effort. QuickCheck2 is suppossedly done, but no code release yet.
18:15:54 <shapr> I'll send another email.
18:17:13 <shapr> Koen is going to get really tired of hearing from me.
18:18:07 <shapr> jesse99: I save the prng seeds, so tests can generate values that can't be easily persistent, like generated functions.
18:18:19 * CosmicRay re-encodes 5GB of video from his MythTV unit
18:18:35 <CosmicRay> 300MB too big to fit on a DVD+R. argh.
18:18:36 <shapr> Is theora ready for real use?
18:18:44 <CosmicRay> I don't know
18:18:54 <CosmicRay> I stick to MPEG-2 because my dvd player can grok it
18:18:58 <shapr> oh
18:19:09 <CosmicRay> my video capture card also has hardware MPEG-2 encoding
18:19:27 <CosmicRay> so usually I can go directly from there to DVD without any re-encoding, only re-multiplexing
18:19:36 <shapr> hey if you ever want to build a music player box, musicpd.org has just become my favorite music player, and it's design for such a task.
18:20:09 <CosmicRay> slick
18:20:20 <CosmicRay> mythtv has a music player module that is sufficient for us for now
18:20:22 <shapr> It uses about 0.1% cpu on my dual 1544MHz
18:20:24 <Heffalump> what will QuickCheck2 do?
18:20:30 <CosmicRay> if you haven't ever checked out mythtv, it's real cool.
18:20:43 * CosmicRay waits for a compile to grab some IO space...
18:20:56 <shapr> Heffalump: Whatever the questionarre suggested I guess. I know shrink will be in there, and maybe the TDD code I wrote.
18:21:19 <Heffalump> the what?
18:21:30 <shapr> Btw, Heffalump came up with the idea to save failing QC values, and that was how I got the idea to write the QC TDD code.
18:21:45 <shapr> Test-Driven-Development, the best way to code.
18:21:54 * Heffalump disputes that
18:22:12 <shapr> Since I don't have time for a dispute, you win by default :-)
18:22:31 <jesse99> what's better than tdd?
18:22:31 * CosmicRay duly notes this also
18:22:56 <jadrian> any news about the new QC?
18:23:13 <jadrian> shapr: I like the saving values idea, but IMO it should be more general
18:23:19 <shapr> how?
18:23:38 <jadrian> shapr: QC functions shoudl return values
18:23:49 <jadrian> shapr: not print them
18:24:01 <shapr> huh?
18:24:14 <jadrian> right now when something fails the data is printed
18:24:16 <shapr> ohh
18:24:16 <jadrian> right?
18:24:28 <shapr> That's the standard behaviour, but it's not how my code works.
18:24:43 <shapr> I save the prng seed if the test fails.
18:25:04 <jadrian> yeap, and I think that is great
18:25:20 <jadrian> and it is something I want 
18:25:34 <jadrian> but returning the values would also be useful
18:25:47 <shapr> What would you do with that?
18:25:52 <Heffalump> the values that cause the failing test?
18:25:56 <jadrian> yeap
18:26:01 <jadrian> or maybe both
18:26:06 <jadrian> generated and failed
18:26:09 <Heffalump> what type would the quickCheck function have?
18:26:31 <jadrian> let me see the current types I haven't used it in a couple of months
18:26:43 <Heffalump> Testable a => a -> IO ()
18:26:44 <shapr> probably add -> Maybe Arbitrary to the end, or so
18:26:55 <Heffalump> Maybe Arbitrary makes no sense
18:26:59 <Heffalump> Arbitrary is a type class
18:27:00 <shapr> err
18:27:03 <jadrian> well then it would be, 
18:27:19 <jadrian> Testable a => a -> IO ([a])    <- if it just returned failed tests
18:27:34 <Heffalump> but a in this context is the property
18:27:37 <Heffalump> not the data
18:27:53 <shapr> Arbitrary a => ... -> Maybe a
18:27:55 <jadrian> if it returned both maybe,  IO([a],[a]) 
18:28:06 <Heffalump> shapr: there might be multiple inputs
18:28:28 <Heffalump> prop_eq_lists = \xs ys -> xs == ys
18:28:31 <Heffalump> for example
18:28:43 <shapr> It's a lot easier to just save the seed.
18:28:48 <Heffalump> right :-)
18:28:54 <jadrian> let me look at it
18:29:07 <shapr> ?
18:29:23 <Heffalump> I can imagine some games with existential types being possible.
18:29:46 <shapr> or maybe the XmlRpc variable args trick, but none of that is easy.
18:29:48 <Heffalump> Testable a => a -> IO [Arbitrary]
18:30:04 <Heffalump> data Arbitrary = forall a . Arbitrary a => a
18:30:24 <Heffalump> but you'd need to then add methods to the Arbitrary class to do something useful with the resulting list
18:30:41 <Heffalump> I should be in bed.
18:30:46 * Heffalump makes it so
18:30:59 <jadrian> you're right, it's more complicated than I first thought...
18:31:59 <shapr> I couldn't find another good way to save values.
18:34:20 <shapr> I still haven't found a good way to associate values with code.
18:34:38 <jadrian> right...
18:35:07 <shapr> I came up with a cheesy hack that does it, but it's fragile.
18:35:48 <shapr> and it *requires* that you use the quickcheck.sh script, because I couldn't find another way to get the property name so I could associate the prng seed with the right function.
18:35:49 <jadrian> I was reading Testable and thinking Arbitrary...
18:36:32 <jadrian> seems a little hacky... :-/
18:36:40 <jadrian> but if it works...
18:37:11 <shapr> Any better ideas?
18:37:26 * jadrian is looking at the source
18:38:25 <Pseudonym> You know what I hate most about printers?
18:38:27 <Pseudonym> They're not pure.
18:38:43 <Pseudonym> You can't put the paper back in and get the toner lifted off.
18:38:53 <ne1> Hahahahaha
18:38:59 <shapr> Maybe with e-paper?
18:39:07 <Pseudonym> A declarative printer would be much cooler.
18:39:26 <shapr> That would be neat, put the paper on a surface that sets the colors in the e-paper.
18:39:35 <jadrian> well
18:40:05 <ne1> If I am allowed to think of a piece of paper as a state variable...
18:40:29 <ne1> a printer is actually pure because it's single-assignment.  print once, never change.
18:40:55 <jadrian> class Testable a where property :: a -> Property
18:41:35 <jadrian> maybe start by making this a multiparameter class?
18:42:42 <jadrian> and parameterize Property and Result
18:42:54 <shapr> you'd have to pass the name of the function in as a param.
18:43:36 <shapr> g'day mark!
18:43:46 <mwotton> Oh, hey there shapr.
18:44:06 <jadrian> you mean define a name for each test function, right?
18:44:08 <shapr> What's ranzco?
18:44:11 <mwotton> i don't think i understand xml-rpc yet...
18:44:29 <mwotton> royal australian/new zealand college of ophthalmologists.
18:44:37 <ski> class Printable a where print :: a -> *Paper -> *Paper
18:44:40 <shapr> how'd they get an .edu ?
18:44:48 <dons> hey mrak!
18:44:59 <mwotton> they run courses for eye doctors. :)
18:45:04 <shapr> cool
18:45:06 <mwotton> G'day don. Long time no typee.
18:45:32 <mwotton> shapr: got a basic test for me to assure my sanity with xml-rpc and a basic Plone site?
18:45:44 <mwotton> gah. two basics in one sentence, i'm trying too hard to make this easy. :)
18:46:08 <shapr> well, lemme see..
18:46:20 <shapr> we should probably take part of this to #plone
18:46:36 <mwotton> there already - just figured it'd be easier to find you here. :)
18:46:41 <shapr> true 
18:47:21 <blackdog> shapr: there now
18:52:37 <shapr> hiya jiing 
18:52:59 <jiing> hi, shapr!
18:53:31 <shapr> looking for Haskell info?
18:54:10 <jiing> I am a haskell newbie
18:55:05 <shapr> Do you have any questions?
18:55:43 <jiing> shapr: haskell has windows compiler?
18:55:59 <shapr> Yes, GHC works on windows.
18:56:40 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_622.html#windows
18:56:46 <jiing> shapr: thanks, I am still in the beginning
18:57:04 <shapr> There are resources for learning haskell at the url in the channel topic.
18:58:10 <shapr> If you have more questions, feel free to ask me.
18:58:30 <jiing> shapr: thx
19:02:37 <jiing>  #haskell.se
19:02:55 <shapr> it's for swedish speakers.
19:03:01 <shapr> talar du svenska?
19:12:08 <jadrian> shapr: inget :(  but my sister might be going to sweeden next yer
19:12:20 <jadrian> year*
19:12:39 <SyntaxNinja> hi all
19:12:55 <shapr> Hey SyntaxNinja, your blog is acting funny. Or maybe just liferea.
19:15:00 <SyntaxNinja> what's liferea? how's it acting?
19:15:13 <shapr> it's an RSS reader, and it says that you have 50 new posts everytime.
19:15:25 <shapr> Could be just another liferea bug.
19:16:06 <shapr> blackdog just told me about a nice portland band, Dresden Dolls
19:16:58 <SyntaxNinja> my rss reader seems to think it's fine
19:17:03 <shapr> ah, ok then.
19:17:20 * Pseudonym just learned about a band named Transatlantic
19:17:20 <Pseudonym> Anyone heard of them?
19:18:32 <monochrom> Does it sell Zapelline flights?
19:18:59 <Pseudonym> Not that I'm aware of.
19:19:16 <Pseudonym> Interestingly, there is a Zeppelin that turns up on their album covers.
19:19:18 <monochrom> oops, band.  I read brand.
19:19:23 <Pseudonym> Ah.
19:20:49 <Pseudonym> Anyway.
19:23:45 <shapr> hiya Philippa 
19:24:43 <SyntaxNinja> hi Philippa
19:39:35 <syntax_syntax> Pseudonym Transatlantic is semi-okay.
19:39:48 <Pseudonym> What's the semi part?
19:39:52 <syntax_syntax> Pseudonym it's a "super-band" with members of other 90's prog bands.
19:39:58 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
19:40:08 <Pseudonym> Kind of like Asia, only worth listening to?
19:40:25 <syntax_syntax> Pseudonym well, kinda a mix between Yes and Savage Garden.
19:40:31 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:40:37 <Pseudonym> Well I like Yes and I like Savage Garden.
19:40:46 <Pseudonym> So sounds like a winner.
19:40:48 <syntax_syntax> it's not bombastic like Asia, it has long songs with whacked out themes and kick-ass keyboard solos.
19:40:55 <Pseudonym> Ah, cool.
19:40:56 <syntax_syntax> It also gets sentimental in a stupid way.
19:41:31 <Pseudonym> That's okay.  I like Rick Wakeman, so I'm used to long songs with whacked out themes, kick-arse keyboard solos and sentimental in a stupid way.
19:41:55 <syntax_syntax> get the first song from the SMPTe album, I forgot what it's called.
19:42:55 <Pseudonym> Is that album meant to be a joke name?
19:43:05 <syntax_syntax> it's their innicials.
19:43:08 <Pseudonym> SMPTE is the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.
19:43:14 <syntax_syntax> er, initials.
19:43:17 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
19:43:21 <syntax_syntax> P is for Portnoy, Dream Theater's drummer.
19:43:36 <syntax_syntax> M is for Steve Morse, of Dixie Dregs fame and currently with Deep Purple.
19:44:27 <syntax_syntax> it's quite a stellar line-up, but those almost always botch. 
19:44:41 * Pseudonym nods
19:44:46 <Pseudonym> Oh, it's a Power Trio(tm).
19:44:52 <Pseudonym> Very 70s.
19:44:55 <syntax_syntax> it's a quintet, I think.
19:44:59 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
19:45:07 <syntax_syntax> there's a keyboardist and a standalone singer.
19:45:16 <Pseudonym> Seems like it's worth checking out, though.
19:45:21 <Pseudonym> For me, anyway.
19:45:38 <syntax_syntax> Transatlantic essentially tried to do a commercial type of prog-rock. Not commercial in a whacked-out 80's Asia way, but in picking the essentials of 70's prog-rock  la Yes and smoothing them out to be more accessible.
19:45:45 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:45:55 <Pseudonym> So like late Pink Floyd?
19:46:04 <syntax_syntax> sorta, yes.
19:46:07 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:46:11 <syntax_syntax> Porcupine Tree is more like Pink Floyd.
19:46:15 <syntax_syntax> You'd like Porcupine Tree.
19:46:20 * Pseudonym nods
19:46:32 <Pseudonym> I must say, I have a scant knowledge of modern prog rock.
19:46:50 <syntax_syntax> Porcupine Tree is also in the same space of 90's-act-smoothing-out-the-70's-masters, but it's a little more serious.
19:46:57 * Pseudonym nods
19:47:27 <Pseudonym> Which is a failing on my part.
19:47:57 <Pseudonym> All of the old classic acts are getting worse as time goes on.
19:48:04 <syntax_syntax> now, for _real_ prog-rock, my classics are "Close to the Edge" by Yes (that's the obvious one), Gentle Giant -- their entire oeuvre, almost, except for the last album and Kultivator's "Barndomens Stigar".
19:48:07 <Pseudonym> Peter Gabriel and Rush's latest offerings seem quite crap.
19:48:20 <syntax_syntax> The only good 90's true prog band is Anglagard.
19:48:27 <shapr> Pseudonym: try this - http://www.magnatune.com/artists/ehren
19:48:38 <syntax_syntax> I like Rush's latest offering. It's prolly their best since the Moving Pictures days. 
19:48:39 <Pseudonym> I do have one Iona album, if you like prog neo-Celtic.
19:48:43 <Pseudonym> Really?
19:48:49 <Pseudonym> I didn't hear good things about it.
19:48:55 <Pseudonym> Good to have another data point.
19:48:59 <syntax_syntax> it's because it alienated Rush fans.
19:49:02 <syntax_syntax> It has no guitar solos.
19:49:07 <Pseudonym> Ah, I see.
19:49:11 <syntax_syntax> It has no instrumental showoffs and catchy choruses.
19:49:16 <Pseudonym> shapr: Interesting.
19:49:27 <syntax_syntax> It has no Ayn Randian bercapitalistic preaching.
19:49:44 <syntax_syntax> It sounds like what a Sonic Youth album would sound like if Chris Cornell was in the band.
19:49:45 * Pseudonym laughs
19:50:02 <shapr> I don't like jazz piano, but I started listening to that album because it's been the best selling album on magnatune as long as it's been available.
19:50:18 <Pseudonym> I did like Thrak-era King Crimson, though.
19:50:28 <Pseudonym> That stuff was pretty good.
19:50:37 <syntax_syntax> I've heard nothing but stellar things about The Power To Believe, and I haven't had the chance yet :-(
19:50:56 <Pseudonym> I am very glad that classic rock is coming back, though.
19:50:59 <syntax_syntax> do you like Black Metal, Pseudonym?
19:51:14 <Pseudonym> syntax_syntax: Can't say I do, with the possible exception of Queensryche.
19:51:17 <syntax_syntax> I've been very impressed with Ephel Duath's "Rephormula".
19:51:20 <Pseudonym> That's not really that black, though.
19:51:22 <shapr> mmm, Queensryche
19:51:25 <syntax_syntax> Queensryche != Black metal :-D
19:51:31 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
19:51:36 <Pseudonym> They do parody it a little, though.
19:51:41 <Pseudonym> Or they did.
19:51:50 <shapr> Operation Mindcrime was the heaviest stuff available at the time.
19:52:09 <syntax_syntax> Ephel Duath's Rephormula is a very dark and "heavy" album, but it's so complex and manufactured.
19:52:26 <syntax_syntax> I showed it to my then-gf and she asked "why are two bands playing different songs at the same time?"
19:52:32 * Pseudonym laughs
19:52:37 <Pseudonym> Actually true story.
19:52:49 <syntax_syntax> it's like what would happen if Franz Lizst was the leader of Pantera :-)
19:52:52 <Pseudonym> An Australian composer, during the 70s, was asked to do music for a cigarette advert.
19:53:01 <Pseudonym> This was back when cigarette adverts were legal.
19:53:23 <Pseudonym> Anyway, they wanted something classy and classical, but it had to feature the jingle as a theme.
19:53:36 <Pseudonym> So this guy found that it worked as a fugue, and hired a string quartet to perform it.
19:53:50 <Pseudonym> Cigarette company executive: "No good.  They can't play together."
19:54:11 <Pseudonym> Honestly, some people/
19:54:19 <syntax_syntax> My dad was a choral director. 
19:54:39 <shapr> Does Gwar count as black metal?
19:54:42 <syntax_syntax> His group became somewhat popular in his native Bolivia, so they got a record deal.
19:54:52 <syntax_syntax> shapr Gwar is more like death/grind stuff.
19:55:05 <shapr> Armored Saint?
19:55:08 <Pseudonym> I never liked black metal that much, but it's possible I've jsut never heard anything good.
19:55:13 <Pseudonym> I like actual harmony.
19:55:26 <syntax_syntax> so after the record is done -- and this is the 70's, analog recording is expensive -- the guy from the record studio says "It sounds like an organ".
19:55:30 <shapr> I'm lucky, my town is covered up in Metal bands.
19:55:44 <syntax_syntax> Pseudonym get Ephel Duath's "Rephormula" off slsk or something. It's a  marriage made in hell.
19:55:51 <shapr> hiya asymptote, looking for Haskell info?
19:55:53 * Pseudonym makes a note
19:56:01 <asymptote> shapr not really, just like talking about haskell
19:56:10 <syntax_syntax> asymptote it's prog-rock appreciation day in #haskell :-P
19:56:24 <syntax_syntax> Pseudonym but, before that, before everything, you MUST listen to Kultivator's  "Barndomens Stigar".
19:56:24 <Gahhh> Evergrey roxors
19:56:25 <asymptote> are the B52's still prog or am I dating myself?
19:56:45 <syntax_syntax> shapr must listen to kultivator too.
19:56:51 <Pseudonym> The B52's were never prog.
19:56:51 <shapr> never heard of 'em
19:56:54 <asymptote> bleh
19:57:02 <syntax_syntax> It's the greatest rock album of all times.
19:57:08 <Pseudonym> And before you ask, neither were the Bay City Rollers.
19:57:14 <syntax_syntax> And they're shamefully unknown. Easy to find in Soulseek, though.
19:57:17 <Gahhh> That's rumored to be the dark side of the moon.
19:57:22 <asymptote> Eh I'm a Tom Waits fan anyways
19:57:28 <syntax_syntax> Don't get moral on me, mister, Kultivator vinyls have been sold for $10K on ebay.
19:57:55 <syntax_syntax> so get it off Soulseek or something. NOW!
19:57:56 <shapr> Er, I don't buy music from Big Media labels anymore. Only total indies, usually online labels.
19:58:07 <shapr> I refuse to fund the DMCA.
19:58:25 <shapr> I also don't download music against its license.
19:58:33 <asymptote> shapr agreed
19:58:41 <syntax_syntax> I don't think Kultivator would have anything against downloading, though.
19:58:44 <Pseudonym> I want to live in a Roger Dean-designed house,
19:58:53 <syntax_syntax> They pressed like 1500 copies of their album in vinyl, in 1980.
19:59:37 <syntax_syntax> The record label prolly doesn't even exist anymore.
19:59:55 <syntax_syntax> here. I just found a weblog that has the files for download.
20:00:57 <syntax_syntax> bah, it's broken.
20:01:36 <shapr> I wouldn't download it if the license weren't explicitly legal. I feel it's hypocritical for me to pirate music and then get upset when a company breaks the GPL or so.
20:02:15 <tintin> shapr: coool :)
20:02:29 <tintin> you are the man :) 
20:02:30 <syntax_syntax> well, what happens if the record label goes bust, and the only way to get the music is attempt to snatch one of the 1500 existing copies for >$5K?
20:02:43 <shapr> I won't get the copy.
20:02:55 <shapr> I'll just keep voting to fix the stupid laws.
20:03:07 <syntax_syntax> you can't vote out laws in Sweden.
20:03:08 <Pseudonym> Arguably there should be laws that let you do non-commercial things with orphaned works.
20:03:18 <shapr> syntax_syntax: I'm a US Citizen.
20:03:32 <syntax_syntax> well, the Kultivator album was never published in the US.
20:04:10 <syntax_syntax> a CD reissue would make some serious cash, but I don't even know where to find the musicians.
20:04:16 <tintin> Pseudonym: yes if its truly abandoned its in the public domain 
20:04:34 <shapr> My approach is twofold, I download free music, from sites like legaltorrents.com, and I make my own music.
20:04:37 <tintin> syntax_syntax: advertise in the media 
20:04:42 <syntax_syntax> there's a small cult around Kultivator, and enough people would buy a CD reissue with full cover arts and all.
20:04:42 <tintin> newspapers 
20:04:47 <Pseudonym> Yeah, but if the copyright holder does nothing, it's not abandoned by definition.
20:05:00 <Pseudonym> Until the copyright term expires, which is never under US law.
20:05:04 <shapr> Right
20:05:06 <syntax_syntax> tintin yes, but it's already a risky business plan, risking money in newspaper advertisement would kill all profitability.
20:05:08 <shapr> Look at the mouse copyright.
20:05:11 <asymptote> not "never" , just 'indefinitely'
20:05:12 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:05:19 <Pseudonym> "Until further notice."
20:05:39 <Pseudonym> Orphaned works should have a legal status.
20:05:55 <shapr> I think the laws are obviously broken. But I also think part of our social contract is to follow all the laws without exception, and fix the broken laws when we find them.
20:06:04 <Pseudonym> Not necessarily.
20:06:11 <Pseudonym> There's also a place for true civil disobedience.
20:06:18 <Pseudonym> i.e. breaking the law in public
20:06:22 <shapr> True, but gnutella ain't it.
20:06:26 <Pseudonym> Doing it in private is cowardice.
20:06:31 <shapr> yup
20:06:31 <Pseudonym> Agreed.
20:06:46 <asymptote> luckily I don't like very much license-restricted music
20:06:52 <shapr> I do :-(
20:07:21 <shapr> But irate.sf.net, gnomoradio, etc is helping me break the habit.
20:07:55 <Pseudonym> I don't buy a lot of albums.
20:08:08 <Pseudonym> My wife and I have about 500 CDs between us, so there's always something to listen to.
20:08:21 <Pseudonym> It's bizarre.  When we got married and merged our collections, we had precisely two albums in common.
20:08:21 <asymptote> shapr keep in mind non-license-restricted includes stuff like Dave Matthews, Phish, the Grateful Dead...
20:08:26 <syntax_syntax> when will Snopes remove their MIDI music? It's annoying.
20:08:42 <Pseudonym> And they were both Spinal Tap. :-)
20:08:50 <shapr> asymptote: I like Dave Matthews, can you give me more info on that?
20:08:59 <shapr> Phish and the Dead aren't really my style.
20:09:10 <asymptote> shapr Dave Matthews allows all non-commercial trading of live recordings of his songs
20:09:19 <asymptote> shapr listen to "ripple" some time
20:09:31 <shapr> Spiffy. Have you seen all the legal live shows on archive.org?
20:09:41 <Pseudonym> I don't think I smoke enough cannabis to appreciate Phish or the Dead.
20:10:26 <tintin> shapr: following copyright laws is extremely costly affair though .... I had to send a fortune to complete my education.... The books were so expensive .... 
20:11:06 <tintin> at times i had to send more than my term fee for the books :)
20:11:13 <Pseudonym> I think that's a technological thing.
20:11:22 <Pseudonym> The cost of printing books is expensive.
20:11:32 <Pseudonym> Especially technical books.
20:11:38 <shapr> I don't have a degree, I only purchase books with which I want to teach myself. But I agree with you. I would like to subscribe to the Journal of Functional Programming, but not for five hundred pounds per year.
20:11:58 <Pseudonym> It's cheaper to publish pulp fiction, because the cost of the editor and publishing house can be amortised over the run.
20:12:30 <Pseudonym> A limited-interest work, like a technical book, can't spread the overheads as thinly.
20:12:30 <tintin> Pseudonym: na its not costly 
20:12:40 <tintin> We had these LPE here in India 
20:12:58 <tintin> but AW had a policy of making them extremely expensive even for LPE 
20:13:02 <Pseudonym> Interesting.
20:13:18 <tintin> P. Hall was my fav. publisher 
20:13:28 <tintin> they always made their books affordable 
20:14:12 <tintin> K&R was available for something like $2 
20:14:51 <Pseudonym> Back in the day when I got my copy, it was cheaper to photocopy it.
20:15:02 <Pseudonym> Something like AUD$60 for a very slim volume.
20:15:16 <tintin> oh believe me its a lot cheaper to photocopy it ....
20:15:30 <tintin> but i usually did shell out the cash 
20:15:40 <Pseudonym> I shelled out the cash, yes.
20:16:15 <tintin> unless it was so expensive no book shop carried it and refused to get it to me in time ....
20:16:26 <tintin> no student credit cards back then ... 
20:16:40 <tintin> no ordering on the Internet 
20:17:05 <Pseudonym> Thankfully, I had a well-stocked university book shop.
20:18:08 <tintin> its really a joke ... to state books can't be published cheaper ... They don't want to ....
20:19:00 <shapr> so add to wikibooks
20:19:10 <shapr> Get your teacher to use a wikibook for the next textbook
20:19:59 <Pseudonym> That's the thing.  Electronic books and publish-on-demand _should_ be the solution.
20:20:01 <shapr> friend of mine started Unicyclopedia.org recently
20:21:11 <Pseudonym> I'm not sure that wiki books are the whole answer.
20:21:21 <Pseudonym> They are, by definition, a moving target.
20:21:31 <shapr> you want tags?
20:21:39 <Pseudonym> That'd help.
20:23:31 <Pseudonym> I'm also not convinced of the conceptual integrity of a wiki-based book.
20:23:48 <Pseudonym> Most books should have a narrative which is hard to preserve when you have multiple authors.
20:24:32 <SyntaxNinja> the type of when is annoying
20:24:33 <Pseudonym> A reference book that's designed to be dipped into (e.g. an encyclopaedia or dictionary) is a good example of something that doesn't need a narrative.
20:24:44 <Pseudonym> @type when
20:24:45 <lambdabot> bzzt
20:24:53 <shapr> WardsWiki has a pattern, once a page has 'solidified' it's refactored from ThreadMode to ArticleMode
20:25:30 <shapr> WikiGnomes are there to keep the conceptual integrity.
20:26:08 <SyntaxNinja> @type Monad.when
20:26:09 <lambdabot> Monad.when :: forall m. (Monad m) => Bool -> m () -> m ()
20:26:13 <SyntaxNinja> see what I mean?
20:27:01 <Pseudonym> Ah, yes.
20:27:04 <Pseudonym> I see what you mean.
20:27:15 <Pseudonym> But what happens if it's false?
20:27:47 <Pseudonym> I can see (Monad m) => Bool -> m a -> m ()
20:27:52 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, that's what I want
20:27:55 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:27:58 <Pseudonym> Submit a patch.
20:28:36 <SyntaxNinja> it was mentioned on one of the mailing lists; but no one really said anything
20:28:44 <Pseudonym> This is actually a general problem.
20:29:02 <Pseudonym> There are a lot of monad functions which require return values which are ignored.
20:30:01 <SyntaxNinja> I'd be glad to fix it myself;
20:31:03 <SyntaxNinja> it wouldn't break anything, right?
20:31:26 <SyntaxNinja> I guess it could
20:32:38 <Pseudonym> It could theoretically.
20:32:58 <Pseudonym> I bet I could come up with something that did break.
20:33:06 <Pseudonym> If the monomorphism restriction was turned on, for example.
20:33:13 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
20:33:27 <SyntaxNinja> in theory, theory and practice are the same, but in practice they are not
20:33:33 <SyntaxNinja> therefore, since in theory it would break
20:33:35 <Pseudonym> Ah, I know!
20:33:36 <SyntaxNinja> in practice, it will not.
20:33:41 <Pseudonym> when False (read "")
20:34:12 <SyntaxNinja> :t read

20:34:22 <Pseudonym> @type read
20:34:24 <lambdabot> read :: forall a. (Read a) => String -> a
20:34:24 <lambdabot> read :: forall a. (Read a) => String -> a
20:34:37 <SyntaxNinja> read is the wrong type, no? or is Read a monad?
20:34:57 <Pseudonym> @type when False (read "")
20:34:57 <SyntaxNinja> I guess we could have when_ and unless_ just like sequence_
20:34:58 <lambdabot> bzzt
20:35:02 <asymptote> all io is monadic I thought
20:35:03 <Pseudonym> @type Monad.when False (read "")
20:35:05 <lambdabot> Monad.when False (read "") :: forall m.
20:35:05 <lambdabot> 			      (Monad m, Read (m ())) =>
20:35:05 <lambdabot> 			      m ()
20:35:10 <SyntaxNinja> read isn't in the IO monad
20:35:10 <Pseudonym> That types, you see.
20:35:14 <SyntaxNinja> @type readFile
20:35:15 <lambdabot> readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
20:35:17 <Pseudonym> Ah, yes.
20:35:23 <Pseudonym> @type Monad.when False (return (read ""))
20:35:24 <lambdabot> Monad.when False (return (read "")) :: forall m. (Monad m) => m ()
20:35:28 <Pseudonym> OK, _that_ types.
20:35:33 <Pseudonym> Because () is an instance of Read.
20:35:46 <Pseudonym> But under your proposed change, the system wouldn't know which instance of Read to use.
20:36:00 <Pseudonym> Admittedly this is not behaviour that I care to keep.
20:36:02 * SyntaxNinja deletes self
20:37:08 <SyntaxNinja> or you could have a function "doSomethingWithWhen :: (Monad m) => (Bool -> m () -> m ()) -> Bool" which would break any code that calls "doSomethingWithWhen when"
20:38:13 <Pseudonym> Actually, no that'd work.
20:38:20 <Pseudonym> I think.
20:38:39 <Pseudonym> Yes, it'd work.
20:38:40 <Pseudonym> Try it and see.
20:39:33 <Pseudonym> BRB
20:41:38 <shapr> great, spam on LtU
20:43:50 <Lemmih> Damn. My system has gone from annoying to unusable /-:
20:43:58 <shapr> what's the problem?
20:44:56 <shapr> Lemmih: shutdown X, edit your XF86Config-4 change nvidia to nv, and X should come back up with no OpenGL, and more stability.
20:45:23 <Lemmih> Kernel cant find the root partition.
20:45:28 <shapr> !
20:46:21 <SyntaxNinja> hmm. this is a great idea for Debian... two more versions.  stable, testing, annoying, unstable, unusable, experimental
20:46:35 * shapr snickers
20:46:54 <Lemmih> Hah (:
20:47:45 <Sonarman> lol
20:49:21 <SyntaxNinja> that way at least "apt-get upgrade" would have clear semantics ;)
20:51:06 <Pseudonym> Surely stable == unusable?
20:51:16 <Pseudonym> Ah, I know.
20:52:13 <Pseudonym> Just rename stable, testing, unstable, experimental to obsolete, subtlybroken, broken and caveatemptor.
20:53:48 <Sonarman> lol again
20:57:17 <SyntaxNinja> heh
20:57:21 <SyntaxNinja> this is too much
20:57:34 <Pseudonym> Bye.
21:00:25 <Gahhh> wow
21:05:24 <SyntaxNinja> back
21:06:19 <Gahhh> you're over the debian jokes ?
21:06:40 <SyntaxNinja> I would like to write a function which checks to see whether there are any .hs files in a source directory that are missing from the cabal description file
21:06:44 <SyntaxNinja> except that it just seems like a big pia
21:06:50 <SyntaxNinja> but it would be pretty useful, right?
21:06:59 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: actually, I just had to change locations
21:07:39 <SyntaxNinja> and it's too bad too, because the coffee shop I was in had a really cute punk girl sitting nearby
21:08:23 <Gahhh> they hire those on that very purpose
21:08:38 <SyntaxNinja> they get paid to sit in coffee shops you mean?
21:08:47 <Gahhh> Yes
21:08:50 <SyntaxNinja> plus recursing directories is scary because of symlinks
21:09:23 <asymptote> Just keep a breadcrumb trail
21:09:50 <SyntaxNinja> as if cabal weren't magic enough as it is ;)
21:10:57 <Pseudonym> See, punk coming back in fashion just encourages me that all is right with the world.
21:11:09 <Pseudonym> Goth was so boring, though the elaborate costumes were cool.
21:11:31 <shapr> Scary, I just read some pseudocode and mistook it for Haskell. It's so close I didn't notice at first.
21:11:42 <Pseudonym> So did it typecheck?
21:11:48 <shapr> http://www.bluerwhite.org/btree
21:11:56 <SyntaxNinja> shapr has a pseudo-code type checker built into his vision 
21:12:48 <shapr> It had a subscript in the code, and I don't know how to make subscripts in Haskell. So it failed my typecheck.
21:13:26 <SyntaxNinja> heh, the first thing I saw was 'while' 
21:13:53 <SyntaxNinja> shapr obviously has rosier colored glasses than I
21:13:56 <shapr> @index while
21:13:57 <lambdabot> bzzt
21:14:01 <shapr> oh well

21:27:47 <jemfinch> (yes, I'm in the right channel; I have a comparison I'd like to make but only a Zope/Plone hacker would be able to verify it)
21:28:22 <SyntaxNinja> bah, plone programmers don't know how to write error messages ;)
21:29:12 <jemfinch> SyntaxNinja: ain't that the truth!
21:29:39 <jemfinch> SyntaxNinja: maybe it's just the fact that many of my project's users aren't the brightest stars in the sky, so I've gotten practice writing reasonable error messages.
21:30:53 <SyntaxNinja> keep up the good work!
21:32:22 <SyntaxNinja> I hate bad error handling
21:32:37 * jemfinch too.
21:37:39 <monochrom> @type foldl

21:46:31 * tintin wonders what plone is ....
21:47:32 <jemfinch> tintin: plone.org
21:50:31 <tintin> why should one use plone instead of something else ? 
21:51:09 <jemfinch> tintin: why not?
21:51:52 <tintin> what would be the factor that would make me shift my loyalty to the current set of tools ?
21:52:11 <tintin> what is the selling point ?
21:52:18 <jemfinch> tintin: uh, I'm not selling Plone.
21:52:20 <jemfinch> I'm using Plone.
21:52:43 <monochrom> Plone is said to have terrible error messages.  I love terrible or no error messages.
21:52:52 <tintin> jemfinch: i did not say you were selling plone ...
21:53:17 <tintin> But for some tool to be successful there has to be something better than what's in use ... 
21:53:41 <KrispyKringle> or good marketing. 
21:54:10 <Gahhh> or sheer luck
21:54:12 <tintin> or they are a Monopoly ....
21:54:22 <jemfinch> tintin: Well, it's written in Python, it has a quality security model, it does a lot of crap already.
21:54:49 <monochrom> Terrible error messages are a strength.  When you train a dog you don't give it comprehensible error messages.  You give it stick or biscuit.
21:55:18 <Gahhh> The more technical and confusing the error message, the more trained is the user. It keeps you sharp.
21:55:30 <jemfinch> Gahhh: or the more secure is the consulting job :)
21:55:53 <tintin> monochrom: in-effect its worthless for tom dick and harry to run their webpages ?
21:56:12 <KrispyKringle> monochrom: i'm unaware of any experimental evidence to suggest that comprehensible error messages would *not* be valuable to the dog, though, either. 
21:56:15 <KrispyKringle> to be fair. 
21:56:17 <tintin> and needs trained people who are smarter than the average ?
21:56:18 <monochrom> who are tom dick and harry?  I don't know them.
21:56:50 <monochrom> if you refer to the ordinary user, well the ordinary dog err I mean user needs training badly
21:57:28 <tintin> hmmz that's hardly a selling point ...
21:57:32 <Gahhh> It's part of natural selection.
21:57:47 <monochrom> YES!  Natural selection is a selling point.
22:00:45 <monochrom> Managers can use Plone to test the competence of their employees.  "Can you decipher this error message?  Stay/Fire"
22:03:32 <monochrom> Makes for great interview questions too.  "You don't have clock but you have two strings that you can burn, one 30 minutes another 45 minutes.  Plone gives the error message 'type error at line 456 cannot instantiate int to bool'.  What should you do?"
22:04:50 <KrispyKringle> that's possibly the weirdest thing I've heard all night. 
22:07:29 <tintin> monochrom: turn off the computer and go home :)
22:07:39 <Gahhh> is that a real error message ?
22:07:50 <monochrom> No, I made it up.
22:08:17 <Gahhh> That's a good one though. I should use it some time. with your premission to copy.
22:08:25 <monochrom> yes you can copy
22:08:57 <tintin> Gahhh: do you plan on driving people nuts ?
22:09:08 <monochrom> haha
22:09:14 <Gahhh> tintin, I live on that kind of stuff.
22:09:38 * Gahhh remembers reading Tintin. Time flies.
22:09:43 <tintin> how very kind of you ...
22:10:02 * tintin put black paint over all his pages ... 
22:17:18 <SyntaxNinja> hmm.  I was just joking about plone error messages, I have no idea what they're like, but it's reassuring that you all take my word as gospel. 
22:18:39 * tintin waves his fist at SyntaxNinja and vows revenge 
22:19:20 <SyntaxNinja> be careful what you wave... at a NINJA!!1
22:19:56 * SyntaxNinja applies an unsound compiler optimization on tintin
22:28:31 * tintin ducks and reminds SyntaxNinja of the power of the one ...
22:30:06 <monochrom> and don't forget the power of the zero
22:30:32 * SyntaxNinja forces tintin to develop the perfect Time library for Haskell
22:33:02 * tintin concedes defeat 
22:37:25 <SyntaxNinja> is anyone following the Time discussion on libraries@?
23:05:23 <Pseudonym> I gave up on the time discussion.
23:05:30 <Pseudonym> It was getting very tedious.
23:05:45 * autrijus mumbles something about http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime/.
23:06:08 <autrijus> (and http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DateTime&mode=dist )
23:06:12 <Pseudonym> Yeah, a lot of people mumbled that.  And other things.
23:06:17 <Pseudonym> www.datetime.de
23:06:34 <Pseudonym> I think that was it.
23:06:41 <Pseudonym> Woop!
23:06:45 <autrijus> ..
23:06:46 <Pseudonym> Not the site I had in mind.
23:06:54 <autrijus> freudian slip eh.
23:07:03 <Pseudonym> There was a datetime library for the Amiga.
23:07:21 <Pseudonym> www.penisland.com
23:07:22 <Pseudonym> That's it.
23:07:24 <Pseudonym> No, hang on...
23:07:35 <autrijus> ...
23:07:48 <Pseudonym> Actually, you can go to that site.  It's perfectly work-safe.
23:08:00 <autrijus> TMI TMI.
23:08:11 <Pseudonym> Why, don't you like pens?
23:08:33 <autrijus> I don't like connection time out.
23:08:40 <autrijus> it's penisland.net ;)
23:08:45 <Pseudonym> Ah, that's it.
23:11:41 <Gahhh> Work-safe or not, I think such DNS requests are frowned upon heh
23:11:52 <Pseudonym> As I seem to recall, Perl's DateTime library doesn't have a lot of help with alternative calendars.
23:11:57 <Pseudonym> Which the Amiga one does.
23:12:29 <autrijus> Pseudonym: http://search.cpan.org/search?query=datetime+calendar&mode=all
23:12:44 <autrijus> 9 calendars on the first page.
23:12:49 <autrijus> so... *shrug*
23:12:56 <monochrom> heh "pen island".  There is another one: "experts exchange".
23:13:12 <Pseudonym> I had a problem with a proxy and "Strong's exhaustive concordance".
23:14:23 <autrijus> hmm, DateTime::Calendar::Chinese looks quite authentic
23:16:43 <Pseudonym> Anyway, must dash.
23:16:46 <Pseudonym> Nytol!
