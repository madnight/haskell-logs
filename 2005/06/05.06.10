00:18:30 <dons> hey xerox!
00:19:38 <xerox> dons, did the author made a public hoogle repo? :)
00:19:58 <dons> he sent me a copy

00:20:03 <lambdabot> Prelude.map :: ((a -> b) -> [a] -> [b])
00:20:24 <xerox> @hoogle [

01:21:41 <boegel> @seen shapr
01:21:42 <lambdabot> Last time I saw shapr was when I left #haskell 6 hours, 24 minutes
01:21:42 <lambdabot> and 32 seconds ago, and I have missed 12 seconds since then.
01:23:10 * TFK will not attempt to build lambdabot
01:23:26 <xerox> Why?
01:23:30 <TFK> Why not?
01:23:40 <xerox> bzzt.
01:23:49 <TFK> I don't get the million dollars?!
01:23:49 <ash007> hi hi ?
01:23:53 * TFK cries
01:23:59 <xerox> hi ash007!
01:24:13 <ash007> hi xerox
01:24:20 <ash007> wats up?
01:24:31 <xerox> ash007, hmm.. playing Go.  What about you?
01:25:03 <ash007> relaxing at home..
01:25:14 <ash007> thought could get some info here
01:25:25 <ash007> seems like a lot of cse pple in here
01:25:31 <xerox> Indeed.
01:25:59 <dons> cs & e?
01:26:17 <ash007> italian?
01:26:27 <ash007> yup computer science and engineering
01:26:34 <xerox> echo cse | sed -e 's/e//'  maybe?
01:26:34 <xerox> ou :)
01:26:36 <ash007> hmms looks like they are dead now
01:26:50 <dons> hehe
01:26:52 <ash007> nah /who *cse.unsw.edu.au will do
01:26:53 <dons> CS forever!
01:27:00 <ash007> counterstrike?
01:27:01 <ash007> lol
01:28:53 <Itkovian> dead? my ass!
01:28:55 * boegel mentions he has classes with e people, and they are quite nerdy
01:28:56 <boegel> :p
01:29:12 <ash007> lol
01:29:20 <boegel> hi Itkovian ! :)
01:29:30 <Itkovian> hi boegel.
01:29:33 <ash007> in belgium?
01:29:41 <boegel> ash007: yep
01:29:58 <ash007> wow.. they actually send them to belgium..
01:30:06 <ash007> or were they from belgium in the 1st place?
01:30:07 <boegel> ash007: send who ? :)
01:30:30 <boegel> ash007: the e people are from belgium, yeah
01:30:40 <ash007> e pple?
01:31:01 <TFK> Autoconf complains on Windows. Anyone built lambdabot on it?
01:31:08 <boegel> engineering people
01:31:16 <ash007> ic.....
01:31:31 <ash007> but I want CSE pple!
01:31:34 <boegel> have you guys heard about the 'new' WinXP bug ? it's so funny
01:31:34 <dons> TFK, it has been done, yes.
01:31:44 * TFK tinkers with the autoconf script
01:32:31 <boegel> when you create a HTML page with an image in it, and you set the height and width equal to 999999, XP crashes when you visit that website (with any browser)
01:32:51 <vegai> the whole OS?
01:32:53 <ash007> sounds like an IE bug
01:32:59 <ash007> BSOD?
01:33:01 <dons> wow.
01:33:03 <boegel> vegai: the whole OS, BSOD yep
01:33:18 <vegai> good... good...
01:33:21 <boegel> good ? :)
01:33:23 <dons> s/XP/any other OS in the world/
01:33:37 <vegai> I was going for my poor Emperor imitation
01:33:37 <boegel> dons Fedora linux doesn't crash at all
01:33:56 <dons> sorry, I was ambiguous -- you should replace your OS with anything else
01:34:00 <dons> they're all better ;)
01:34:12 <boegel> for those who want to try it: http://www.thq.nl/blue
01:34:21 <boegel> dons: oh ok :)
01:36:12 <ash007> yah like OSX when it finally runs on intel proc!
01:36:14 <ash007> w00t!!!
01:36:42 <TFK> Are there windows binaries of lambdabot, then? This error message has me stumped.
01:36:42 <Itkovian> bwaark
01:37:14 <dons> TFK, nope. it's stricly "build it yourself".
01:37:15 <xerox> ash007, but still only on Macintosh hardware..
01:37:29 <TFK> Gotcha.
01:37:29 <dons> one option is to generate configure on a machine that already has a working autoconf
01:37:34 * Itkovian sighs
01:37:54 <TFK> Well, the autconf *should* work. But it complains about a file that's not there, when it's clearly there.
01:38:11 <ash007> yah... but at least it aint winDows
01:38:35 <xerox> ash007, what?
01:39:04 <ash007> xerox, the MAC on Intel proc!
01:39:42 <xerox> ash007, you'll prolly never have an OS X installation CD/DVD for you PC, I mean.
01:40:14 <ash007> oh... yah.... but still.. they will bring the price down when they switch..
01:40:23 <ash007> mac mini is liek 590 USD now...
01:40:35 <ash007> if it goes to 500USD thats even more affordable.
01:40:54 <TFK> Either that, or MSYS isn't smart enough to figure out that the paths given to it are absolute, which I doubt.
01:41:23 <xerox> I'd think technical reason are more important than economical one, but we live in such a system...
01:41:45 <ash007> yes... not everyone can afford a mac
01:42:15 <Itkovian> the problem is that the mac mini is also 590 euro's
01:42:23 <Itkovian> which is like 650 USD
01:42:27 <Itkovian> or something
01:42:46 <dons> hmm. too many $$
01:43:01 <dons> when you can get a VIA embedded system for ~150US
01:43:10 * boegel is satisfied with his Toshiba laptop
01:44:28 <xerox> I'd love to have a more silent && cooler laptop than my AMD one, anyway.
01:45:20 <ash007> get an intel lappy!
01:45:24 <ash007> T42s are gr8
01:46:18 * TFK tries to build hs-plugins-0.9.8
01:46:30 <dons> no no. that won't work
01:46:35 <dons> you need the latest darcs
01:46:41 <TFK> :-/
01:46:44 <dons> it wass only ported to windows about 4 weeks ago
01:46:50 * TFK tries to build the latest hs-plugins
01:47:10 <dons> this does build and run quite well on windows. using the mingw system is best, not cygwin
01:47:30 <dons> mingw is more stable with dynamic loading, and much faster
01:47:56 <TFK> Yup, mingw is what I have.
01:48:41 <TFK> Excuse my ignorance in large-scale software, but why does all this need to be ported anyway? Why isn't a Haskell compiler enough?
01:49:11 <dons> "ported" mean removing unix-isms from the hs-plugins code
01:49:13 <boegel> dcoutts_, dcoutts: I can't seem to find the gtk2hs0.9.8 release... where is it ?
01:49:31 <earthy> plus, it probably depends on platform specific linking conventions, right?
01:49:36 <dons> it's still just Haskell, but it's portable Haskell. so it doesn't use the Posix libs, and doesn't depend on /dev/null for example
01:49:44 <dons> nope
01:49:53 <dons> well, sort of.
01:49:57 <earthy> okaay... that's good then. :)
01:50:07 <dons> the ghc rts linker handles the individual linker conventions
01:50:16 <TFK> But it still requires the GNU find ;-)
01:50:17 <dons> hs-plugins is an abstraction layerr on top of that
01:50:28 <earthy> ah right
01:50:33 <dons> hs-plugins doesn't care if it is elf, a.out or macho, for example
01:51:04 <earthy> other than that the ghc rts linker should understand it.
01:51:14 <boegel> @seen shelarcy
01:51:15 <lambdabot> I saw shelarcy leaving #haskell 14 hours, 27 minutes and 27 seconds
01:51:15 <lambdabot> ago, and I have missed 12 seconds since then.
01:52:18 <dons> yep, we need the ghc rts to know how to deal with particular platforms
01:52:39 <dons> so no mips64 hs-plugins, even though ghc runs there
01:53:31 <TFK> Bah. Maybe I should just install Ubuntu today and be done with it :-/
01:54:13 <dons> this is a wise decision, considering the large-html exploit pointed out earlier ;)
01:55:19 <TFK> Which exploit?
01:55:25 * TFK has been living in a cave for a while now
01:57:08 <xerox> Hi ndm!  Any news?
01:57:58 <xerox> What would you use in Haskell if you need to keep something like a database?
01:58:15 <ndm> Hi xerox, nope - not really
01:58:35 <dons> haskellDB?
01:59:02 <xerox> dons, does it need some SQL backend?
01:59:11 <dons> think so, yes.
01:59:20 <dons> check the libraries page for other stuff on databases
02:00:00 <boegel> TFK: when you create a HTML page with an image in it, and you set the height and width equal to 999999, XP crashes when you visit that website (with any browser)
02:00:26 <boegel> TFK: try it ! http://www.thq.nl/blue
02:00:31 <xerox> dons, anything simpler for little projects?
02:00:31 <TFK> erm.
02:00:41 <TFK> Maybe later ^_^;
02:00:45 <dons> hmm. use read/show ?
02:04:01 <xerox> Wouldn't it be nice to have something like http://docs.python.org/lib/module-shelve.html in Haskell?
02:12:43 <stefanw> I've a problem with signals: I do `threadWaitRead 0 >> getch' in the main thread (getch is from the ncurses library)
02:13:02 <stefanw> then a signal arrives and I invoke ungetch from the signal handler
02:13:37 <stefanw> but the main thread is still block in threadWaitRead; in fact, threadWaitRead only returns when I type an input character by hand
02:13:44 <stefanw> any ideas, dons?
02:14:06 <dons> hmm
02:14:34 <dons> you've compiled -threaded?
02:14:43 <stefanw> I though I had fixed the signal/resize problem some time ago, but I haven't I guess
02:14:44 <dons> not sure if that matters here
02:15:16 <TFK> dcoutts, it appears that GtkSourceView is not even ported to Windows. :-/
02:15:18 <dons> so in Yi I have:
02:15:19 <dons>         getcLoop :: Chan Char -> IO ()
02:15:20 <dons>         getcLoop ch = repeatM_ $ threadWaitRead 0 >> getcE >>= writeChan ch
02:15:56 <dons> getcE eventually invokesss the curses getch
02:16:26 <mflux_> stefanw, btw, any progress on cabalizing hscurses?-)
02:16:32 <stefanw> everything works fine as long as I don't call ungetch from within a signal handler
02:16:55 <dons> hm
02:17:19 <stefanw> mflux_: I tried but I stayed with the ./configure make based system. However, hscurses works now with GHC 6.4
02:17:50 <mflux_> well, that's actually what I need, thanks ;)
02:17:55 <dons> does it need 6.4.1 or -fasm, stefan?
02:18:03 <stefanw> Reasons for not switching to cabal: I still want support GHC 6.2. and don't want to maintain two build systems
02:18:54 <stefanw> I'm using 6.4 with -fasm, but configure should find out if -fasm or -fvia-C should be used
02:19:08 <dons> oh, I should steal that code
02:19:22 <stefanw> mflux_: be aware, it's a fresh darcs repo (I somehow messed up the repo some time ago...)
02:19:35 <mflux_> hmm..
02:20:03 <mflux_> so should 'darcs pull' just work on an old checkout or should I start with a clean slate?
02:20:47 <dons> bits are cheap. darcs get!
02:21:02 <stefanw> darcs pull won't work I think, just use darcs get
02:27:05 <stefanw> -threaded doesn't help
02:32:05 <stefanw> mflux_: what are you doing with hscurses?
02:35:11 <mflux_> stefanw, I'm looking at writing a news/mail reader.. although I guess it is unlikely to ever become anything ;)
02:35:42 <dons> mflux, adapt riot!
02:35:48 <mflux_> riot?
02:35:53 <dons> it's already got a ncurses interface, and can read mail
02:35:56 <dons> it just can't send mail
02:36:02 <dons> @google tuomov riot
02:36:04 <lambdabot> http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/riot/
02:36:14 <dons> yi was developed from a fork of riot
02:36:55 <dons> hscurses is directly desended from riot, too, via yi
02:37:16 <mflux_> I think I'm shooting for something a bit differnet.. although so is yi different from riot ;)
02:37:28 <mflux_> and something I would need to write would be a curses widget set
02:37:38 <dons> doesn't hscurses do that these days?
02:38:13 <dons> anyway, there's already a mailbox parser, and an ncurses interface. so you could steal some of that.
02:38:27 <stefanw> yes, it a table-widget, a text-input-widget, a text-widget and an empty-widget
02:38:36 <stefanw> it = it has
02:38:39 <mflux_> how does the layout work?
02:39:31 <mflux_> so are there vboxes and hboxes ála GUIs or just manually placed?
02:39:44 <stefanw> you use the table widget for it. every widget has either a fixed or a minimum size and the table widget tries to be a bit clever in arranging the subwidgets
02:43:27 <stefanw> mflux_: I would need a terminal-based calendar application :-) I've already written a parser for ical files but not enough time to continue it ...

03:59:14 <lambdabot> Igloo is in #haskell. I don't know when Igloo last spoke.
04:03:03 <boegel> yo Itkovian
04:04:14 <goron> Anyone running FreeBSD in here?
04:05:18 <Itkovian> a logn time ago
04:06:42 <goron> The GLUT detection doesn't work when you install from ports. :( I mailed the maintainer, but he doesn't respond).
04:08:00 <goron> For ICFP they are distributing Java  Sun Java 1.5 on the CD. Isn't this illegal?
04:12:26 <jlouis> goron: it probably is ;)
04:12:54 <jlouis> it would only be fair to give the Java people a disavantage from the start, now we do not have a GHC 6.4 ;)
04:14:25 <goron> jlouis, I was just thinking that.
04:15:10 <Itkovian> why would that be illegal?
04:15:36 <Itkovian> goron: mail again, spamming works :-)
04:15:42 <Igloo> arjanoosting: Hello
04:16:34 <goron> Itkovian, Because only Sun has the right to distribute.
04:16:44 <jlouis> Itkovian: Sun disallows redistribution of Java
04:16:55 <Itkovian> ah, well ...
04:17:01 <jlouis> Which does not make sense at all, because they want _exactly_ that
04:17:04 <Itkovian> stupid
04:17:09 <goron> yep
04:17:23 <wilx> Hmm, some products ship with JVM.
04:17:23 <jlouis> If the JVM had been in every major operating system now, the world would have looked a bit differently
04:17:29 <vegai> many just disregard that stupid license
04:18:20 <goron> Do you have to pay Sun $$$ when you commerically use Java for your products anyway?
04:19:26 <nibro> jlouis: but we do have GHC 6.4 :-)
04:21:10 <jlouis> nibro: oh, cool. Then they changed it
04:21:48 <arjanoosting> Igloo: Hi
04:22:11 <Igloo> Hello!
04:22:25 <arjanoosting> I have updated my haxml package (again); no more autogeneration of debian/control on build-time
04:22:44 <Igloo> Cool
04:23:23 <arjanoosting> and maybe you could have a look at it and see if everything is right now
04:23:58 * Igloo isn't going to have time today, I'm afraid  :-(
04:25:02 <arjanoosting> ok, that doesn't matter :)
04:25:26 <boegel> jlouis -, nibro : the listing still says GHC 6.2.2
04:25:57 * arjanoosting will be gone this weekend anyway so I can't update it until monday evening anyway
04:30:42 <dons> steefanw, you added or removed unsafePerformIO?
04:31:12 <dcoutts> boegel, it's called gtk2hs-ghc64-0.9.7.91-1.fc3.i386.rpm
04:31:36 <boegel> dcoutts: huh ? I thought it was 0.9.8 ?
04:31:53 <dcoutts> it's the 0.9.8 release candidate
04:32:11 <boegel> oh ! I thought it was released already
04:32:34 <stefanw> dons: I added :-) I've implemented my own input queue
04:32:57 <dcoutts> @seen TFK
04:32:59 <lambdabot> I saw TFK leaving #haskell 2 hours and 12 minutes ago.
04:33:09 <boegel> dcoutts: is there any way to check which version I have installed?
04:41:11 <Itkovian> boegel: rpm ?
04:41:23 <Itkovian> man rpm
04:42:03 <boegel> Itkovian: apparently I haven't installed the previous version of gtk2hs using rpm
04:42:10 <boegel> 'cause I'm getting errors now :(
04:43:34 <dcoutts> boegel, rpm -q gtk2hs
04:43:47 <boegel> [root@localhost src]# rpm -q gtk2hs
04:43:47 <boegel> package gtk2hs is not installed
04:43:47 <boegel> [root@localhost src]#
04:43:50 <boegel> meh :s
04:45:25 <Itkovian> have you installed it by hand?
04:45:27 <boegel> and when I try to installed gtk2hs-glib-ghc64 it says I need gtk2hs-glib-ghc64 :|
04:45:34 <boegel> Itkovian: could be, it's been a while
04:46:02 <boegel> Itkovian: oh wait, no, because I've just installed ghc 6.4
04:46:10 <boegel> so I had to re-install gtk2hs
04:46:23 <boegel> and I did that using the rpm's on Fedora Haskell
04:46:26 * boegel grrs
04:46:27 <Itkovian> ok
04:51:55 <Lemmih> nibro: Ping.

05:03:28 <goron> TFK, Unlikely.
05:04:52 <TFK> goron, I hope you said that in a humorous tone.
05:06:10 <dcoutts> TFK, you're right about GtkSourceView, no one has built it for windows, not that it'd be impossible if we really wanted it
05:06:53 <TFK> Well, I can check out Yi now, see how it works.
05:07:07 <TFK> At least there's a goal to make it cross-platform.. right?
05:07:12 <dcoutts> but I do like the idea of Yi with a Gtk GUI...
05:07:46 <goron> TFK, Ow, ok, I don't know about developerfriendlyness of Ubuntu.
05:08:03 * goron dumped Ubuntu Hoary. 
05:08:12 <TFK> goron, you mean it sucks?
05:08:19 <dcoutts> TFK, yes cross platform for an IDE would be the aim, well, at least Linux/Unix and Windows, I know nothing of OSX
05:08:24 <xerox> I'm using it at the moment :)
05:08:27 <goron> TFK, Well, for my purposes, yes.
05:08:43 <TFK> Here's a concrete idea I have - none of the Haskell shells support name binding the usual way, right?
05:09:01 <goron> TFK, They don't?
05:09:20 <xerox> In GHC you can let <name> = <expr>, I think you can't in hugs, tough.
05:09:28 <goron> ^^
05:09:33 <TFK> You can use let in Hugs as well, I think.
05:09:38 <TFK> However, using let is troublesome.
05:10:15 <dcoutts> TFK, in hugs you can only use let in a expression, in ghci you can say > let foo = 3
05:10:20 <dcoutts> and foo is in scope from then on
05:10:35 <TFK> dcoutts, hmmm, really? no let-in, just let?
05:10:39 * TFK will test this
05:10:40 <xerox> Exactly!
05:10:40 <dcoutts> yes
05:10:53 <xerox> Prelude> let foo = 2
05:10:53 <xerox> ERROR - Syntax error in expression (unexpected end of input)
05:11:11 <ski> hugs ?
05:11:14 <xerox> Yep.
05:11:23 <ski> it doesn't support that
05:11:28 <ski> ghci does
05:11:33 <xerox> That's what I meant before.
05:11:38 <TFK> Heh, GHCi does support that :-D
05:11:42 <ski> you can use   let foo = 2 in ...   in hugs  if it's not too long
05:12:04 <TFK> And all this time, I had no idea.
05:12:08 <xerox> TFK, do you really program Haskell without using let all the time? heh.
05:12:55 <TFK> Me? I'm just a newbie. I didn't write that much Haskell.
05:13:09 * xerox too
05:13:45 <goron> In my first year of Haskell, I didn't use let. Now I do.
05:13:53 <goron> I always used "where"
05:14:14 <xerox> goron, I do like where clauses more than let ones.
05:14:23 <TFK> I think I have some lets in HBin, but HBin itself is quite basic. (And also offline - I haven't set up Apache here yet.)
05:14:34 <xerox> I mean, first you get the `algorithm', then the secondary details.
05:15:11 * Itkovian feels like dancing
05:39:22 <TFK> Lambdabot, Yi, Gtk2Hs aren't present in Synaptic.
05:41:51 <goron> TFK, I am not aware of Yi being packaged.
05:42:00 <goron> TFK, On any OS.
05:42:16 <TFK> That would be consistent with my observation.
05:43:37 <vegai> I'll make one when they make the next release ...
05:45:19 <TFK> I'll try building from source.
05:49:28 <TFK> configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH <--- doesn't gcc count?
05:49:36 <TFK> gcc 3.3, in fact.
05:49:50 <wilx> It would find gcc if it was in path imho.
05:50:02 <TFK> (trying to compile gtk2hs)
05:50:17 <TFK> gcc-3.3 tab-completes.
05:50:35 <wilx> It searches only for stuff like cc and gcc.
05:50:37 <TFK> It even says "no input files" when I try to run it :-P
05:50:48 <wilx> CC=gcc-3.3 ./configure
05:51:30 <TFK> woo! Thanks
05:51:49 <TFK> Now it complains about gobject.
05:56:17 <dcoutts> TFK, still trying to build from source?
05:56:35 <TFK> on ubuntu!
05:57:15 <dcoutts> oh, ok that should be no problem. I thought you might still be trying win32!
05:57:22 <Itkovian> YES! I did it! Jikes on DSS ... now Haskell stuff ...
05:57:33 <dcoutts> you're using the 0.9.8 release candidate? (gtk2hs-0.9.7.91.tar.gz)
05:57:41 * Itkovian wonders if that would work ... does ghc generate altivec code on powerpc?
05:58:11 <TFK> nope, 0.9.7.1
05:58:29 <TFK> where can I get the rc from?
05:58:36 <dcoutts> TFK, and your using ghc-6.4 ?
05:58:50 <TFK> nope, 6.2
05:59:23 <dcoutts> oh, it should work with 6.2, you can get the rc from http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/gtk2hs-0.9.7.91.tar.gz
05:59:48 <dons> TFK, no one has said anything to me about Yi being packaged yet
05:59:55 <dcoutts> and the rc of course will work with 6.4 (but earlier versions required patches for ghc-6.4)
06:00:18 <dcoutts> dons, that's because last time I asked, you said it wasnt' ready yet. :-)
06:00:27 <dons> oh, that's right ;)
06:00:43 <dcoutts> dons, I'll do an ebuild upon your command :-)
06:00:55 <dons> well, hw paper is done, so I can think about polishing up Yi in the next  few weeks
06:01:33 <dcoutts> but it'd be helpful if it worked with ghc-6.4 (which requires hs-plugins on 6.4 I believe)
06:01:53 <dons> yes. we need the new hs-plugins, and for amd64 we even need 6.4.1
06:02:12 <dons> but hs-plugins is getting pretty close now
06:02:21 <dcoutts> cool
06:02:42 <dcoutts> how close is ghc 6.4.i would you say?
06:02:46 <dcoutts> i/1
06:04:03 <dons> hmm. not sure. i thought things were close to a release last week. but simon hasn't said anything particular
06:04:39 <dons> i know autrijus is waiting for 6.4.1 for pugs too
06:04:54 <TFK> Erm. Should I build as root or can I build as a normal user?
06:05:15 <dcoutts> TFK, build as normal user, install as root
06:05:53 <dcoutts> or even install as user if you use the right ./configure options
06:06:05 <dcoutts> eg ./configure --prefix=$HOME
06:06:25 <dcoutts> dons, I think we're waiting for 6.4.1 for Gtk2Hs on amd64
06:06:54 <dcoutts> not that it's going to delay our release
06:10:20 <Igloo> Doesn't 6.4 work unregisterised?
06:10:55 <tuomov> ot: what do you call a cd/dvd blank that burning failed on in english?
06:11:15 <dcoutts> Igloo, it works except for the heap corruption bugs :-)
06:11:15 <wilx> foo ~(x,y) = something
06:11:20 <wilx> What does the tilde mean?
06:11:34 <dcoutts> tuomov, a coaster
06:11:36 <dons> who cares about the heap anyway, eh duncan?
06:11:44 <Igloo> Oh, the -M750M -H700M thing?
06:12:13 <Igloo> wilx: It won't check the pattern until you actually try to use x or y
06:12:19 <TFK> Bah, I can't seem to find gobject-2.0.pc. Does anyone know where it might reside?
06:12:20 <tuomov> dcoutts: thanks.
06:12:43 <xerox> @google Yi haskell editor
06:12:45 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi.html
06:12:52 <tuomov> (in Finnish it is "hylsy" for "F" or fail grade.)
06:12:54 <wilx> Hmm, I don't understand.
06:12:57 <dcoutts> Igloo, no, that's just win32 oddness, ghc-6.4 on amd64 has some heap corruption bugs which cause Gtk2Hs and wxHaskell programs to segfault.
06:13:12 <Igloo> Oh, fair enough. I don't remember that
06:13:27 <dcoutts> TFK, part of glib-devel or some similar package perhaps
06:13:38 * Igloo wonders if that means 6.4 will break compiling 6.4.1
06:14:19 <dcoutts> Igloo, there was one in particular to do with the compacting GC but I think there was another one too
06:15:18 <dcoutts> dons, absolutely! real coders use pre-allocated global vars, none of this nancy dynamic allocation
06:16:05 <dons> and garbage collection! if  you don't know when to free(), you don't know what you're doing ;)
06:17:03 <TFK> libglib2.0-dev?
06:17:15 <dcoutts> yeah, it's a simple rule free() when dropping the last reference. I don't see what all the fuss is about.
06:17:22 <dcoutts> TFK, sounds likely
06:17:39 <wilx> dons, I agree with the last, seriously. GCs are bad. They obfuscate ownerships.
06:17:40 <dons> yes. very simple, really.
06:17:59 <wilx> ...in imperative languages.
06:18:32 <dcoutts> wilx, but we don't care about ownerships :-) it makes life easier
06:19:07 <wilx> It makes programs memory hogs.
06:20:14 <dcoutts> TFK, you'll probably need -dev versions of the other packages too, gtk, pango and if you want the optional bits you can install glade, gconf, surceview and mozembed too!
06:20:31 <dcoutts> that is true
06:20:34 * TFK 's head will explode before that o.o;
06:20:47 * TFK hugs his GC
06:21:33 <xerox> dons, is "/my/dir" in "--prefix=/my/dir" the current working directory, i.e. where darcs put the sources?
06:22:28 <dons> sorry? what program are we talking about?
06:22:55 <TheHunter> @plugs let foo ~(x,y) = "foo" in foo undefined
06:22:56 <lambdabot> "foo"
06:22:59 <TheHunter> @plugs let foo (x,y) = "foo" in foo undefined
06:23:01 <lambdabot> Fail: Prelude.undefined
06:23:24 <xerox> dons, Yi.  In the README files where it explains how to compile && install.
06:23:24 <dons> the under-appreciated ~
06:23:48 <dons> oh,  1. ./configure --prefix=/my/dir
06:23:56 <dons> /my/dir is where you want to install it to
06:24:02 <dons> i.e. /usr/local or /home/xerox
06:24:05 <dons> i'll fix that
06:24:30 <xerox> dons, ok!  No "make uninstall" available, right?
06:24:37 <dons> not for yi.
06:24:41 <dons> rm -rf is your friend
06:24:51 <dons> it only installs into bin/ and lib/
06:25:03 <dons> oh, and share/ if you built docs
06:25:12 <xerox> uhm, OK.  I'll put it in /usr/local.
06:25:38 <dons> well, there's no need to install it though
06:25:43 <dons> you can run it in-place
06:25:52 <dons> which is good for playing around with it
06:25:54 <xerox> Yes I saw it, maybe it's better.
06:26:08 <dons> just use ./yi-inplace
06:27:44 <lisppaste2> Enveigler pasted "FFI: Cstruct mapping" at http://paste.lisp.org/display/8981
06:28:14 <dons> TheHunter, did I see at one point you'd worked out a way to do callbacks into lambdabot?
06:28:25 * dons is thinking of a darcs commit plugin
06:30:27 <xerox> Boot.hs:54:0: Failed to load interface for `Plugins': Could not find module `Plugins': use -v to see a list of the files searched for
06:30:52 <xerox> Could it be the fact that it's called "plugins-0.9.8" the cause?
06:30:54 * TFK started "make"! Woo!
06:30:59 <xerox> Probably not.
06:31:01 <dons> oh, you've got yi0.1.0?
06:31:08 <dons> grab yi from darcs, and hs-plugins from darcs
06:31:24 <xerox> dons, yes, as the site states.
06:31:32 <xerox> I'll darcs pull.
06:31:43 * dons should release hs-plugins-0.9.10 soon
06:32:23 <TheHunter> dons, look at Paste.hs. I don't remeber the details but i think it should work even after a reconnect.
06:32:38 <Itkovian> @seen boegel
06:32:38 <lambdabot> I saw boegel leaving #haskell 1 hour, 35 minutes and 8 seconds ago.
06:32:46 <Itkovian> hi shapr
06:32:56 <shapr> Man, I had a great lambdabot idea just a few minutes ago, and now it has escaped me.
06:33:00 <shapr> That sucks.
06:33:00 <dcoutts> dons, so what did you think of our musings about embedding/extending Yi into a full IDE ? :-)
06:33:30 <dons> oh yes. I saw that.
06:33:48 <dons> we should embed and extend
06:33:59 <shapr> How so?
06:33:59 <xerox> OK, great, it is compiling.
06:34:25 <dcoutts> is that like embrace and extend?
06:34:31 <dons> ok. step 1) gtk2hs ui
06:34:44 <dons> step 2) hmm, refactoring support
06:34:52 <dons> and add other haskell tools as plugins
06:34:58 <dons> i.e. drift, for example
06:35:03 <dons> darcs, maybe
06:35:12 <dons> since any haskell app can just get dynloaded...
06:35:24 <dons> 3) get some more people to write code..
06:35:30 <xerox> We do need some revolutionary UI :-)
06:35:35 <dcoutts> jump to definition in the code or the haddoc docs is the killer IDE feature in my opinion
06:35:46 <xerox> dcoutts, *indeeed*.
06:35:52 <dons> Yi needs to get to the  critical point still of being useful
06:35:59 <TFK> dcoutts, how long might it take to build gtk2hs on a 1.8 GHz CPU, 256 MB RAM system?
06:36:15 <shapr> Yeah, that critical point would be very nice.
06:36:17 <dons> as shapr has pointed out before, syn hl and just a couple of extra haskell-ish things would be enough
06:36:17 <xerox> hoogle/haddock/libsrc/M-. tools.
06:36:18 <dcoutts> I had some UI plans with hIDE 2 soe time ago, I've still got the glade mockups
06:37:15 <dcoutts> TFK, if you're doing the default optimising build with all the optional packages and docs then about half an hour or so perhaps?
06:37:17 <shapr> I often use emacs without X, so I'd like to retain the console mode of Yi.
06:37:23 <dons> me too.
06:37:42 <dons> but we need to extract ncurses just a little bit
06:37:46 <shapr> Yeah, true.
06:37:46 <dcoutts> TFK, A non opimising build on a 3GHz system is about 5min
06:37:50 <dons> one idea i'd like to try is swappable uis at runtime
06:37:54 <shapr> Oh, that would rock.
06:38:05 <dons> seems doable since we've got full hot swapping going anyway
06:38:11 <shapr> Especially since gnu emacs can't run on both console and X at the same time. Xemacs can though.
06:38:15 <dons> so we're not comitted to a ui statically
06:38:24 <xerox> It fsck up the terminal when one does :q... :-)
06:38:32 <TFK> dcoutts, oh. Well, I just ran ./configure with nothing else.
06:38:41 <TFK> So I suppose it'll be finished soon enough.
06:38:48 <dons> so you could get bored of one ui half way through, type :gtk say, and you'd be in the new gui
06:38:49 <kzm> shapr, hi.  I think I mailed you about a PDF MonadReader...
06:38:49 <shapr> dons: think you'll have time for a Yi sprint over the summer?
06:38:51 <dcoutts> dons, it's possible to start up Gtk+ later or fallback to ncurses if Gtk+ initialisation fails (like if there is no X connection)
06:39:13 <shapr> kzm: Oh yeah, I have a partially written reply in one of my hundreds of open emacs buffers.
06:39:13 <dons> yeah. gvim does that
06:39:23 <dons> shapr, i hope to.
06:39:29 <dons> i've just finished a paper about yi and hotswapping
06:39:30 <shapr> Actually, Oleg and a bunch of other people have emailed me about that too.
06:39:36 <dons> so i'm kinda motivated to hack on yi
06:39:41 <shapr> awesome!
06:39:41 <xerox> I suppose it does not screw up the terminal to you...
06:39:59 <dcoutts> dons, with Gtk2Hs you'd need to put an exception handler around the initGUI call
06:40:10 <dons> easy peasy
06:40:11 <shapr> I've been asking smart people for a good re-builder style of incremental parser setup. No one that I've asked has ever used anything like that before.
06:40:39 <dons> interesting.
06:41:09 <kzm> shapr, well - I went to the trouble of PDF'ing it.  If you just take a look, and let me know, and I'll publish the address.
06:41:23 <dcoutts> the eclipse interactive parsers do some fairly hairy stuff I've heard
06:41:31 <dons> TheHunter, re Paste.hs, looks just like what I need for a darcs commit msg callback
06:41:47 <shapr> Problem: I tried to build some semantic bovinator based modes, it was a massive pain in the ass, mostly because I couldn't tell what the heck I was doing. Solution: use interactive mode definition where the parser is defined in one buffer and the text to be parsed in another.
06:41:50 <shapr> Sounds good at least.
06:42:06 <Philippa_> heh
06:42:16 <xerox> Sounds like...
06:42:19 <Philippa_> remember what I suggested as a means of doing something like that on top of parsec?
06:42:23 <xerox> @google The Regexp Coach
06:42:25 <Philippa_> Or did it break your brain too much? :-)
06:42:25 <lambdabot> http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/
06:42:32 <shapr> kzm: Sure, feel free to publish the url in the feedback section of TMR.
06:42:52 <shapr> Oleg suggested switching to lhs2TeX for all input.
06:43:06 <kzm> 'kay - perhaps mail the contributors, so that I don't misrepresent them?
06:43:14 <Philippa_> shapr: that for TMR?
06:43:20 <Philippa_> that would... put me off somewhat
06:43:26 <kzm> I edited a bit, since online and paper are different media.
06:43:37 <shapr> One guy on lambda-the-ultimate.org said he probably wouldn't read issues that don't have pdf/ps output, he said TMR would probably lose readers that way.
06:44:07 <shapr> My thought (that I did not send to him) was that if he can be that picky, he probably doesn't need TMR anyway.
06:44:11 <kzm> I tried to automatically parse and convert the wiki text, but there were style differences that made it difficult.
06:44:32 <shapr> kzm: Wanna write a TMR article about it? ;-)
06:45:02 * kzm isn't quite comfortable with that thought.
06:45:03 <shapr> Philippa_: I remember that you told me about it, but I don't remember what you described. I do recall it was pretty wild.
06:45:10 <shapr> kzm: Aw, why not?
06:45:45 <shapr> I bet you have more formal CS education than I do. I bet you even have more experience writing articles and papers than I do.
06:45:56 <kzm> shapr, Heh. Well - I don't think its terribly interesting, for one thing.  People are just inconsisten in when they use single and double 's and so on.
06:47:08 <kzm> I could do a piece on another parser, perhaps.  But I'm a bit worried that my style sucks -- I'm the only functional programmer I know IRL, and people's eyes just glaze over when I say things like Monadic Parser Combinators.
06:47:10 <michaelw> shapr: you might want to look at climacs for incremental parsing, there might even be a whitepaper about it
06:47:10 <shapr> I think it would be interesting to a lot of people who want to write Parsec parsers and really use it for something.
06:47:34 <kzm> The documentation for Parsec is *really* nice.
06:47:52 <shapr> Yeah, but a useful demo is also nice.
06:47:57 <kzm> But yes.  From a user sort of perspective.  Conservative in what you accept - kind of thing.
06:48:21 <shapr> michaelw: I'll check that out, thanks.
06:49:18 <shapr> Anyway, my unicycle is calling me, I'll bbl.
06:49:26 <kzm> Would somebody volunteer to co-author?  In particular, I need somebody to audit my code and guide my style.
06:49:47 <shapr> Oh, I'll check your article, but other authors should do that also.
06:50:04 <shapr> I invite all the authors, current and previous, to show up and check articles while they're in-progress.
06:50:41 <shapr> Plus you don't have to complete your article immediately, and it doesn't have to be flawless. There's a lot of room for contributing useful information to the Haskell community.
06:50:42 <kzm> Anyway, I must finish the program first.  I can at least promise to take notes as I go along.
06:51:09 <shapr> Wouter Swierstra has been working on an attribute grammar article that was originally slated for the first issue, and it's still not finished.
06:51:32 <xerox> That was one of the main reason to use a wiki for the authors.
06:51:36 <kzm> I hope you didn't forward him an advance on the salary? :-)
06:51:42 <shapr> I've been claiming I'd write shapr's n00b column, and I haven't finished the first article yet, so...
06:51:51 <TFK> Woo! Gtk2Hs installed successfully!
06:52:06 <shapr> An advance on nothing is still nothing :-)
06:52:24 <kzm> :-)
06:52:36 <shapr> I'll bbl
06:52:42 * shapr wobbles away on one wheel
06:52:43 <kzm> Perhaps you could offer to double the salary, as an incentive?
06:53:01 * kzm listens for the inevitable crash.
06:53:28 <dcoutts> TFK, good good. Now run make installcheck to build all the demos and see if they work...
07:01:49 <Philippa_> kzm: re style, do you find it well-readable yourself?
07:01:59 <Philippa_> if you can come back to your code months later and read it fine, odds are it's okay
07:02:13 <kzm> Hehe.  I can usually work it out, at least.
07:02:51 <TFK> dcoutts, it works! :-D
07:02:51 <kzm> But with a new lib (like Parsec), there is alwasy the worry that the code ends up being rather pedestrian.
07:03:21 <kzm> I really wish I had fellow FPers to discuss these things with.
07:03:26 <dcoutts> TFK, so that was the 0.9.8 release candidate right?
07:03:33 <TFK> yup
07:03:46 <sorje> kzm, there probably are, right here. ;-)
07:04:34 <kzm> Hmm....well, I can't post code over a line or two on IRC.  Mail on the lists tends to get ignored, unless it's a specific question that people *want* to answer.
07:04:43 <dcoutts> if you're feeling generous you might try testing the new c2hs C parser as described here: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7459393&forum_id=8415
07:05:08 <kzm> But hey, if anybody wants to audit mine, I offer to audit theirs.  Or go to the next Haskell workshop and buy them a beer or two. :-)
07:05:24 <sorje> kzm, you can paste it on the wiki and post the link. But chances are you'll get ignored too. ;-)
07:07:22 <TFK> dcoutts, will do!
07:07:31 <dcoutts> TFK, actually, I guess you can't try that since you said your machine has 256Mb which is not enough to run the old C parser! :-)
07:07:48 <kzm> sorje, yep - I'd prefer real life.
07:08:34 <dcoutts> Yay! for the new C parser actually allowing people to build Gtk2Hs on ordinary spec'd machines. :-)
07:09:28 <TFK> dcoutts, what about the new parser, though? Err, I guess that the fact that Gtk2Hs *did* build on my box is proof enough...
07:09:35 <kzm> Anybody know what the status is on AMD64-support in GHC?
07:09:41 <TFK> dcoutts, Gtk2Hs for mortals ;-)
07:10:06 <TFK> Now to build lambdabot! I'm getting: Boot.hs: can't locate import `System.Plugins.Load'
07:11:06 <Lemmih> Install hs-plugins.
07:11:11 <TFK> I did.
07:11:16 <TFK> Registered them, too.
07:11:26 <Lemmih> Install a newer hs-plugins.
07:11:37 <TFK> :-/
07:13:43 <dcoutts> @seen vidvandre
07:13:44 <lambdabot> Last time I saw vidvandre was when I left #haskell 1 day, 11 hours,
07:13:44 <lambdabot> 7 minutes and 15 seconds ago, and I have missed 25 seconds since
07:13:44 <lambdabot> then.
07:15:31 <dcoutts> TFK, yes if you had enough RAM we could check that the output of the old and new parsers is exaclt the same. But you're right, it building fine is a good indication.
07:16:40 <dcoutts> kzm, it's improving. It ca run quite a few programs now. It's less good with FFI things. GHC 6.4.1 should be a big improvement for AMD64.
07:21:19 <kzm> dcoutts, ok, thanks.  No hurry on my account.

07:30:48 <TFK> I don't have runhaskell.
07:31:11 <TheHunter> you should. runghc will do, too.
07:31:12 <Lemmih> It's a part of the GHC 6.4 distribution, iirc.
07:31:24 <TheHunter> TFK, what distribution are you using?

09:33:23 <scalopus> Hi
09:33:36 <xerox> Hello scalopus, looking for Haskell information?
09:39:32 <scalopus> i like haskell
09:39:58 <xerox> You're in good company :)
09:40:04 <scalopus> sure :)
09:40:09 <nothingmuch> haskell
09:40:13 <nothingmuch> mmm
09:40:15 <nothingmuch> yummy
09:40:15 <SyntaxNinja> mmmmmmmm
09:41:16 <Lemmih> *drool*
09:41:19 <nothingmuch> A Larry Wall quote: "Lisp is like oatmeal with toenails thrown in"... if haskell is oatmeal with toenails taken out, and a type system, does it mean it tastes well?
09:41:56 <xerox> It depends on how does taste the typesystem, I suppose.
09:42:00 <nothingmuch> basically, what is "oatmeal" in the programming sense, and is the type system equivelent to sugar, etc?
09:42:17 <nothingmuch> gotta take sister to rollerblade
09:42:48 <xerox> Have fun :)
09:43:12 <genneth> @seen boegel
09:43:14 <lambdabot> I saw boegel leaving #haskell 30 minutes and 8 seconds ago.
09:43:17 <genneth> damn him
09:43:24 <xerox> :(
09:43:35 <genneth> his comment early about that bug that causes a crash on windows
09:43:40 <genneth> that html/picture thing
09:43:46 <genneth> guess what i did with that link?
09:43:48 <genneth> i clicked it
09:43:51 <SyntaxNinja> nothingmuch: larry wall is a pervert.
09:43:59 <genneth> and then it promptly killed my work machine
09:44:03 <SyntaxNinja> anyone listening to HIM for tips on language design is wack
09:44:09 <genneth> completely killed the harddrive
09:59:18 <wilx> *BANG!!*
09:59:46 <wilx> That was the sound of my head exploding, thanks to arrows.
09:59:57 <wilx> Since I am dead it is up to you guys to clean up the mess.
10:04:07 * AtnNn cleans up the mess and wonders if he should continue to try to understand arrows
10:07:42 <vegai> yes, said vegai, the headless spectre
10:09:14 <kaol> time flies like an arrow. fruit flies like a banana. I wonder what/how monad flies like?
10:13:43 <SyntaxNinja> I recommend reading up on the afrp and functional robots stuff to grok arrows.
10:13:56 <SyntaxNinja> or actually, space invaders
10:14:35 <xerox> SyntaxNinja, any url?
10:15:33 * Lemmih wish it was possible to specify module dependencies with Cabal.
10:16:09 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: why, is the module offered by more than one package?
10:16:44 <SyntaxNinja> xerox: but I hear the yampa stuff is hard to build these days (it always has been): http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/yale/papers/haskell-workshop03/
10:17:27 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: I got two modules whom are to be preprocesses and the first depends on the second.
10:17:54 <xerox> SyntaxNinja, OK, thanks.
10:20:51 <Lemmih> TH preprocessing opens a new can of worms.
10:21:57 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: you mean layered preprocessing?
10:22:03 <SyntaxNinja> Heffalump was just asking for that
10:22:31 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: the dependencies between modules are captured in the modules themselves
10:22:37 <SyntaxNinja> and ghc sorts it out
10:22:42 <SyntaxNinja> but not for preprocessing
10:42:44 <TFK> haskell-src-exts$ runghc Setup.hs configure      cannot parse package list   <--- that can't be good, can it?
10:44:24 <Lemmih> That's everything it said?
10:47:07 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: what happens when you ghc-pkg -l?
10:48:24 <TFK> /usr/lib/ghc-6.4/package.conf: <--- print a bunch of packages under this one
10:48:38 <TFK> /root/.ghc/i386-linux-6.4/package.conf: <-- no packages under this one, though. (does it even matter?)
10:48:52 * SyntaxNinja shrugs not sure
10:49:36 <SyntaxNinja> if ghc-pkg can parse it, then cabal should be able to parse it
10:49:46 <SyntaxNinja> and unless yous aid configure --user, then it's not looking at the one in /root/.ghc
10:49:56 <SyntaxNinja> hmmmm
10:50:57 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: was I right about layered preprocessing?
10:51:01 <SyntaxNinja> is that what you're asking for?
10:51:23 <Lemmih> Define layered preprocessing.
10:51:34 <TFK> :-/
10:51:38 <Lemmih> I just want some modules preprocessed before others.
10:51:50 <TFK> No Haskell extensions => no hs-plugins => no lambdabot => pain and misery.
10:52:53 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: why?
10:53:18 <SamB> hmm, Cabal doesn't give me very nice errors from Haddock...
10:53:25 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: if that's the case, then we should be a dependency analyzer, which is on the todo list. I am hoping malcolm will donate one ;)
10:53:33 <SamB> I get errors like "dist/build/tmp/src/Text/ParserCombinators/PArrow/Combinator.hs:25:1: Parse error in pattern"
10:53:38 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: ?
10:53:41 <basti_> \x->x!
10:53:54 <SyntaxNinja> SamB: what's wrong with that?
10:53:55 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: How can you make a dependency analyzer for module that haven't been proprocessed yet?
10:53:59 <Lemmih> *modules
10:54:08 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: eh, depends on whether you can read hte import statements
10:54:28 <SamB> SyntaxNinja: when I go to middle click on it, emacs can't find that file
10:54:29 <TFK> SyntaxNinja, these are the dependencies, apparently.
10:54:42 <SyntaxNinja> SamB: oh, it deletes them, 'eh?
10:55:04 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, taht sucks. I wnoder what to do about that.  but that error should be in the file src/Text/Parser...
10:55:13 <SamB> yes. I think it should switch to the right tree before it runs haddock...
10:55:38 <SyntaxNinja> SamB: it needs to run cpp before running haddock, though. that' swhy they're in dist/build
10:55:48 <SamB> SyntaxNinja: oh.
10:55:53 <SyntaxNinja> the source file actually was there, it's just gone now. maybe if haddock fails, then it shouldn't delet ethem
10:56:10 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: sorry, not understanding.
10:56:12 <SamB> does haddock not support #line directives?
10:56:34 <SyntaxNinja> haddock barfs on anything where you need to run cpp, which kinda sucks, but I don't blame haddock
10:56:52 <SyntaxNinja> that's actually why I added haddock support to cabal; because cabal knows how to run cpp :)
10:57:05 <TFK> SyntaxNinja, I am trying to compile lambdabot. To compile lambdabot, I need hs-plugins, right? To compile hs-plugins, I need haskell-extensions. All of which I grabbed from darcs.
10:57:05 <SamB> Now I find myself agreeing that integrating Haddock into GHC might be a good idea...
10:57:23 <SamB> TFK: that sounds good so far
10:57:48 <SamB> except for the part where you imply you are just getting around to this now ;-)
10:58:05 * TFK scratches head
10:58:21 <TFK> At any case, it couldn't parse package list. I'm wondering if it's a bad thing.
10:59:16 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: sounds very strange. if you look at that ghc package config file, does it look corrupted? if you pass --user do you get the same error?
10:59:21 <SamB> which version of GHC are you using?
11:00:03 <TFK> SamB, 6.4, SyntaxNinja, lemme check
11:00:16 <SamB> how are you building?
11:00:37 <TFK> Oh, it works when I pass --user :-)
11:00:51 <TFK> As of now I ran: runghc Setup.hs configure --user
11:01:08 <SamB> which package is that for?
11:02:20 <TFK> Haskell-extensions.
11:04:19 <SamB> did you try running "make" at the top-level?
11:04:47 <SamB> not that it matters now, or anything...
11:05:02 <TFK> Well, I have to run configure first, no?
11:05:11 <RemiTurk> hi all
11:05:30 <SamB> the makefile appears to run that itself...
11:05:32 <TFK> erm, build, that is.
11:07:12 <genneth_> @seen boegel
11:07:13 <lambdabot> I saw boegel leaving #haskell 1 hour, 54 minutes and 8 seconds ago.
11:09:38 <SamB> why would I get this warning:
11:09:46 <SamB> src/Text/ParserCombinators/PArrow/Prim.hs:16:0:
11:09:46 <SamB>     Warning: Pattern match(es) are overlapped
11:09:46 <SamB> 	     In the definition of `matcher': matcher _ _ = ...
11:11:28 <Lemmih> Because the pattern matches are overlapping. (:
11:12:40 <Lemmih> It's impossible to reach 'matcher _ _'.
11:14:22 <SamB> I don't suppose there is a way to tell GHC that, in this case, that is a GOOD thing?
11:14:33 <lightstep> don't -Wall
11:14:48 <SamB> I didn't do it!
11:15:04 <lightstep> -fno-warn-overlapping-patterns
11:15:06 <Lemmih> Remove the definition.
11:15:50 <lightstep> then he'd have non-compatible code
11:15:54 <SamB> Lemmih: but then, if the code later changed so that that WAS reachable, it would return bottom!
11:16:15 * basti_ sighs
11:16:24 <basti_> yi doesnt find hs-plugins anymore
11:16:31 <basti_> i built and installed it though
11:16:34 <Lemmih> SamB: You would get a new warning.
11:16:37 <SamB> basti_: register it!
11:16:44 <basti_> hmm
11:16:44 <SamB> Lemmih: true.
11:16:50 <basti_> wouldnt its makefile do that.
11:17:04 <SamB> basti_: only if you 'make register'
11:17:06 <basti_> ahh
11:17:38 <SamB> maybe he should put something about that in the Yi configure script...
11:17:44 <SamB> like they did with Pugs
11:17:55 <basti_> still doesnt work
11:17:58 <basti_> uhm brb though
11:17:59 <basti_> sorry
11:18:02 <TFK> Language/Haskell/Hsx/Parser.ly: no happy preprocessor available
11:18:03 <TFK> *** Exception: got error code while preprocessing: Language.Haskell.Hsx.Parser
11:18:18 <SamB> TFK: install happy, then
11:18:40 * Lemmih rolls off on one wheel.
11:18:48 <TFK> Oh, it does come with... erm.
11:21:19 <TFK> I just grabbed happy from Synaptic, but it doesn't work - happy isn't even listed in ghc-pkg -l
11:21:41 <Lemmih> Happy isn't a library.
11:22:05 <TFK> Aha. I have to re-configure.
11:22:12 <SamB> does Cabal not have a name for GADTs?
11:26:23 <basti_> hmm
11:26:27 <basti_> registering didnt help too
11:27:01 <SamB> basti_: do you have a recent Yi *and* a recent hs-plugins?
11:27:14 <basti_> yes.
11:27:29 <basti_> hs plugins is 20050407
11:27:30 <SamB> so everything uses the System.Plugins name?
11:27:54 <basti_> it doesnt say which name hs-plugins uses
11:28:10 <basti_> hmmm
11:28:12 <SamB> did you get hs-plugins from darcs?
11:28:15 <basti_> that might be the reason yes.
11:28:23 <basti_> no since dons' server was down when i tried
11:28:27 <basti_> but it might be a reason to retry
11:28:32 <vidvandre> dcoutts, I've built gtk2hs*.92 and it compiles fine. the only thing so far is make checkinstall which fails with "Progress.hs:23:33: Not in scope: `priorityDefaultIdle'"
11:29:14 <SamB> dons really ought to put the darcs repo address right there on the front page with the tarball address...
11:30:36 <TFK> Hmmm. It appears that I still have some 6.2 residue.
11:31:39 <bibach> Fairly new to Haskell, have a question regarding type annotations.  Using HUGS for development.  I have a function that takes an argument of any datatype that is of the Show class.  For most arguments, it just calls "shows", but I want to handle one particular type differently.
11:32:14 <bibach> I tried using a type annotation in the pattern, which required me to switch out of Haskell 98 mode, but even then it didn't work.  How *should* I be doing this?
11:32:59 <norpan> you can't
11:33:42 <bibach> Ok... no way to set something up to allow me to handle one particular type differently than all others?
11:34:01 <norpan> not if you have a function :: (Show a) -> a -> ...
11:34:26 <norpan> err (Show a) => a -> ...
11:35:04 <norpan> but if you tell me what you really want to do, i probably can give you a tip on how to do it
11:35:28 <bibach> The function is :: (Show a) => REsult a -> ShowS, where REsult is a "data REsult a = ..."
11:37:09 <norpan> so this is like the "Show" instance for the Result datatype
11:37:31 <bibach> This is part of an implementation of regular expressions.  The RE datatype can work on "symbols" of any type, and the REsult type is a structure for holding matches.  I want to handle "REsult Char" differently, not calling shows because it throws quotes around the string.
11:37:42 <bibach> right
11:38:24 <norpan> I'm sorry, but I don't think you can do that
11:39:33 <norpan> haskell only allows certain types of polymorphism
11:40:14 <bibach> Okay... so perhaps I'm looking at this the wrong way...
11:40:22 <norpan> this is because it should be able to derive the type of any function
11:41:30 <bibach> The REsult type looks like: data REsult a = RE_PIECE String (REpiece a)
11:41:57 <norpan> what you could do is to define your own type class, and require all symbols to be an instance of that class
11:41:59 <bibach> and: data REpiece a = RE_ATOM [a] | RE_ASEQ [REsult a]
11:42:14 <norpan> but then you have to define instances for all types that you use
11:42:45 <bibach> Yeah, thought about something along those lines...
11:43:08 <CosmicRay> Hi.  I have an e-mail here from Peter Thiemann, author of WASH.
11:43:13 <CosmicRay> I had mentioned Cabal to him
11:43:16 <CosmicRay> he basically said "I won't use a specialized tool like that unless you convince me otherwise"
11:43:21 <CosmicRay> so what points should I mention about Cabal?
11:43:24 <bibach> Thought maybe it could derive from Show and only create instances for types I want to override, but I don't think that'll quite work.
11:44:39 <norpan> you could do that, but you still have to do "instance YourClass YourType" for each of them
11:44:57 <norpan> and the type class can have a default method that just uses the show method
11:45:12 <bibach> Anyway, each REsult has a name (the String) and either an "atom", which is just a list of the symbol type (Char, generally), or a list of nested REsults.
11:45:45 <norpan> So what is the problem with it showing the quotes?
11:45:54 <bibach> I figured that would work, but would kill the generic nature of it.
11:48:52 <bibach> Well, say you've got something like an RE of a.*\(d.*\)g.* and a string "abcdefghi".  The result would be something like "0" ["" "abc" "1" "def" "" "ghi"].  The "0" is the whole match, the "1" is the submatch and the "" are unnamed parts of the whole match.  I'd like to represent this with something like "\0(abc\1(def)ghi)".
11:49:22 <bibach> With the Strings getting quotes around them, I'm getting something more like: \0("abc"\1("def")"ghi")
11:53:48 <bibach> So, where my function currently calls "shows" on the String, I want to do something else to avoid the quote marks ending up in the concatenated result.
12:12:29 <SamB> okay, why is PArrows not documented?
12:12:36 <Lunar^> Is anyone familiar with Coq and nat proofs?
12:16:34 <musasabi> SamB: because I never got around it.
12:17:06 <basti_> Lunar^: a little bit
12:17:53 <musasabi> SamB: If you are interested I can put out a version with documentation next week.
12:19:00 <Lunar^> basti_: I found a work around
12:19:20 <Lunar^> the standard library is a bit unintuitive
12:19:30 <basti_> =)
12:19:30 <wilx> Hmm, I think I have regained enough strength and sanity that I can resume reading that arrows stuff.
12:19:38 <basti_> its proofs.
12:20:34 <Lunar^> Coq is just another programming language :)
12:20:42 <Lunar^> thanks Curry-Howard
12:20:43 <basti_> but a bizarre one
12:21:32 <Lunar^> for sure
12:21:42 <Lunar^> it had GADT first, though :)
12:21:56 <basti_> its still bizarre.
12:23:06 <Lunar^> hehe
12:23:44 * basti_ registered brand new hs-plugins now, but still doesn't see then in ghc-pkg list
12:25:18 <Lunar^> basti_: plugins?
12:25:42 <basti_> yes plugins
12:25:53 <basti_> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/index.html
12:26:22 <CosmicRay> w00t!
12:26:23 <CosmicRay> http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/free_issues/issue_05/haskell/
12:26:26 <Lunar^> doing Coq gets you as bizarre as the language :D
12:26:38 <basti_> i do see them as root though
12:27:12 <Lunar^> CosmicRay: \o/
12:33:59 <aheller> CosmicRay: I heard somewhere you did netBSD stuff.  Do you know why ghci won't build from pkgsrc?
12:34:20 <basti_> ahhhhh
12:34:21 <basti_> got it
12:34:22 <CosmicRay> aheller: I dabble in it about once a year.  sorry, I don't use it currently and can't help you with that.
12:34:26 <basti_> arghhh.
12:34:40 <CosmicRay> aheller: what version is it trying to build?
12:34:53 <CosmicRay> (and what arch are you on?)
12:35:03 <aheller> ummmmmghc-6.2.1: not built for interactive use
12:35:04 * basti_ jumps and hits the ceiling
12:35:14 <aheller> i386
12:35:18 <CosmicRay> hmm.
12:35:20 <SamB> @pl (\f g x -> f x >>= g)
12:35:22 <lambdabot> flip . ((>>=) .)
12:35:26 <CosmicRay> well you might try just building ghc from its tarball
12:35:37 <CosmicRay> or perhaps netbsd has some flag in pkgsrc you have to flip to get ghci or something
12:35:50 <SamB> @pl (\f g x -> g =<< f x)
12:35:52 <lambdabot> flip ((.) . (=<<))
12:35:58 <CosmicRay> otherwise, I'd suggest a post to glasgow-haskell-user or a netbsd mailing list
12:35:59 <aheller> I could do that, I suppose.  I'm trying to use pkgsrc as much as possible because I share the box.
12:36:18 <aheller> Indeed; thanks, I'll take a look.
12:36:21 <SamB> @pl (\x -> f x >>= g)
12:36:22 <lambdabot> (g =<<) . f
12:36:28 <CosmicRay> you don't have to install your custom-built package in /usr... you can just put it under your homedir, too.
12:37:27 <aheller> Certainly, but I was actually building it for everyone; I could put it in /usr/local, also, but if I could rely on pkgsrc, I'd rather do that than maintain the package on my own :)
12:38:33 <CosmicRay> sure, that makes sense
12:38:46 <CosmicRay> you should also report a bug on pkgsrc asking them to package ghc 6.4 :-)
12:39:16 <aheller> It hadn't really occurred to me to expect a package released in the last year to have made it to pkgsrc either :)
12:39:57 <CosmicRay> heh
12:40:17 <CosmicRay> what's this?  netbsd users as sarcastic about up-to-date software as debian users? :-)
12:41:07 <aheller> eh; My friends are netbsd guys; I'm kind of hexed on it.  Never seems to want to install on my hardware, etc.  But they liked it.
12:41:15 <CosmicRay> aheller: I once submitted a netbsd package for something.  gopher maybe.  they didn't add it to the tree until something like 3 months after I had switched back to linux :-)
12:41:18 <aheller> Portage kind of spoiled me.
12:41:24 <aheller> :)
12:41:35 <SamB> you know, &&& doesn't look particularly nice in paper-form (with all the ampersands overlapping tightly)...
12:41:35 <CosmicRay> aheller: portage would be nicer of gentoo didn't mask everything under the sun
12:41:41 <CosmicRay> s/of/if/
12:42:01 <CosmicRay> aheller: I wrote a tool called debsrc that lets you build debian packages and their deps from source ala portage
12:42:06 <CosmicRay> (written in haskell, too)
12:42:33 <aheller> huh.  I'll have to check that out.  apt has bit me in the ass one too many times.
12:42:49 <aheller> But I'm getting to the point where I'm too lazy to go through the whole gentoo setup for my laptop.
12:42:51 <CosmicRay> really?  I've been using it since, well, it came out...  no real problems here.
12:43:00 <CosmicRay> {free,net}bsd otoh have both done annoying packaging things to me.
12:43:26 <SamB> any idea what the meaning of the name MD is in PArrows?
12:43:32 <aheller> I dunno.  Once I couldn't get a tulip card to work under netbsd.  it worked under redhat, debian, windows (98,2k,xp) but not netbsd.
12:43:42 <CosmicRay> gentoo still annoys me with its upgrade procedure, which still uninstalls way too much for production upgrades imho
12:43:46 <CosmicRay> heh
12:44:10 <aheller> My friend (who drinks with christos and a bunch of the other netbsd guys every week) can't seem to manage to install ubuntu.
12:44:18 <CosmicRay> hah
12:44:24 <aheller> some systems just hate some users.
12:44:36 <CosmicRay> or vice-versa :-)
12:44:43 <aheller> to say the least.
12:45:22 <CosmicRay> I, for instance, to not get along with OpenBSD.
12:45:22 <CosmicRay> but then, that's mostly because of Theo.
12:45:41 <aheller> Funny...  I feel like I've heard that sentiment before....
12:45:58 <aheller> from just about everyone I know...
12:45:59 <CosmicRay> aheller: I am but one drop in a giant bucket of people that dislike theo :-)
12:46:45 <aheller> no, I feel like portage lends itself to a small system or a much larger install base where you can have a build host that you pay attention to, and export packages from it to the rest of the bokes.
12:47:02 <aheller> err, boxes/boxim/boxarum, whatever.
12:47:23 <CosmicRay> aheller: I ran into him about 10 years ago.  I was a unix neophyte, and I was trying to decide which os to install.  This was before the time when much info about this was available online.  I posted a question to the netbsd users list, asking about the differences between net and openbsd.
12:47:41 <aheller> oh, my condolences in advance.
12:47:48 <CosmicRay> aheller: theo was still on the list or something, and started up a big flamewar.  He, courteously CC'd me on it, as did all the netbsd folks that replied to him.
12:47:54 <CosmicRay> I just didn't say anythign in reply.
12:48:20 <CosmicRay> funny thing was, about a month later, I got a note from Theo saying, effectively, "just so you know, I've added you to my kill file.  I will never read an e-mail from you again."
12:48:32 <aheller> *ha*
12:48:44 <CosmicRay> and then about every six months for the next few years, I'd get an automated note from him saying, "Just a reminder, you're still in my killfile, so don't bother sending me any mail."
12:49:12 <aheller> It must be my sheer cowardice that keeps me alive.
12:49:53 <CosmicRay> I had no idea about the full story between openbsd and netbsd until quite some time later :-)
12:50:04 <CosmicRay> aheller: heh
12:55:21 <TFK> Woo! I compiled lambdabot!
13:00:38 * SamB wishes haddock supported GADTs
13:07:40 <TFK> dcoutts, is the memory example code supposed to compile under the rc?
13:13:32 <TFK> Hmm, for 0.9.7.1
13:27:41 <basti_> while trying to compile yi (after a new incarnation of everything haskell on my system:)
13:27:44 <basti_> ghc   -I. -package-conf yi.conf -package yi -i -Icbits -c Yi.hs -o Yi.o -ohi Yi.hi
13:27:47 <basti_> In Datei, eingefÃ¼gt von Yi.hs:57:
13:27:49 <basti_> /usr/lib/ghc-6.4/include/config.h:4: Warnung: #warning config.h is deprecated; please use ghcconfig.h instead
13:27:52 <basti_> Yi.hs:100:40: Not in scope: data constructor `PATCH_COUNT'
13:28:50 <basti_> and a few more errors abou caps identifiers
13:33:58 <TFK> Hmph. Can't get lambdabot connect to places.
13:34:26 <TFK> The server gets and ident response, and then nothing.
13:34:58 <musasabi> TFK: if you have a firewall it might take a long time (several minutes).
13:34:59 <TFK> Are there any logs?
13:35:21 <TFK> I don't think that I have a firewall. Besides, it repeats the "Running reader loop..."
13:37:33 <basti_> aghh fixed it by hand
13:41:47 <xerox> g'night
13:42:11 <TFK> night
13:42:26 <SamB> how would I translate (char '>' >> return Next) from Parsec into PArrows?
13:42:37 <Heffalump> oh, who made PArrows?
13:42:39 <SamB> I'm having trouble with the "return Next" part.
13:42:50 <SamB> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/PArrows/
13:42:58 <SamB> Einar Karttunen
13:43:02 <Heffalump> cool.
13:43:21 <Heffalump> (and, err, not sure OTTOMH)
13:43:52 <SamB> I guess I'll try arr (const Next)...
13:44:29 <Heffalump> that was my guess too
13:44:51 <Heffalump> but it was too much of a guess to suggest
13:44:51 <wilx> @type arr
13:44:56 <SamB> returnA blows my mind when I try to think how you would use it ;-)
13:44:58 <lambdabot> bzzt
13:45:11 <Heffalump> arr :: Arrow a => (x -> y) -> a x y
13:45:14 <SamB> @type Control.Arrow.arr
13:45:14 <mike> hi all. I've just started on haskell and template haskell and i got a question about reify. lets say i do x = 5; y = reify ('x) Then y has type Q Info. How do i get my hands on the information stored in y?
13:45:16 <lambdabot> Control.Arrow.arr :: forall (a :: * -> * -> *) c b.
13:45:16 <lambdabot>        (Control.Arrow.Arrow a) =>
13:45:16 <lambdabot>        (b -> c) -> a b c
13:45:44 <Heffalump> mike: inside a Q monad computation, y' <- y
13:46:01 <Heffalump> if you don't know about monads, I suggest you take a step back and learn about them, they're pretty vital for this
13:46:20 <SamB> mike: you absolutely must splice in a Q that sequences that reify
13:46:28 <mike> ok so i do a do { y' <- y; regular code }
13:46:48 <Heffalump> mike: where regular code ends with a return or another expression of type Q foo
13:47:08 <mike> ok, got it. Thanks :)
13:47:15 <SamB> and then, in order for reify to work, you must splice your computation
13:47:47 <mike> ok, thats logical. Thanks
13:47:59 <SamB> runQ will be of no use, because qReify isn't implemented in Quasi IO...
13:48:30 <SamB> which is VERY ANNOYING when you want to use TH in code that needs to work on systems without GHCi
13:48:46 <basti_> y0w. yi builds again.
13:48:56 <mike> yeah, i noticed that about runQ
13:49:10 * basti_ had to pull ghc's innards through its mouth and beat the with a stick
13:51:02 <SamB> basti_: whilst you are doing that, can you get us a userside instance of Quasi that implements qReify and can be run from the IO monad?
13:51:20 <basti_> :-o
13:51:55 <basti_> you sure thats not rather a psychological problem?
13:52:26 <SamB> basti_: maybe that really belongs in haskell-src-exts, or that so-called "ghc" package I've heard of...
13:52:55 <basti_> i wouldnt know what to do with it
13:54:05 <SamB> it could be pretty usefull for writing "compilers" that basically serialize a program's in-memory representation into Haskell code...
13:54:34 <basti_> an uncompiler?
13:55:09 <SamB> if you wonder what I'm talking about, look at the haskell-related compiler backends in Pugs
13:55:52 <SamB> I suppose the REAL solution would be to get GHCi to work everywhere, but...
13:55:58 <basti_> i dont know if i really want to know.
13:56:33 <SamB> perhaps you don't ;-)
14:03:03 <TFK> lambdabot doesn't seem to react to my Config.hs. Do I really need to recompile it every time to change a config option?...
14:03:06 * boegel greets the crowd
14:03:52 <Heffalump> I think so.
14:03:59 <Heffalump> the only dynamic stuff is the module loading
14:04:15 <Heffalump> arguably there should be a config module that you can reload, of course :-)
14:04:17 <TFK> :-/
14:04:20 <astrolabe> crowd cheers boegel
14:04:31 <Heffalump> there you go, good project for you to implement :-)
14:04:44 <Heffalump> SyntaxNinja: you about?
14:05:20 <TFK> Well, I was going for that HBin plugin, but hey..
14:05:29 <Heffalump> I'm not promising to do it, but if I wanted to extend Cabal to support stacked preprocessors, would making the extension specification format be "hscp:hsc" instead of just "hsc" be a reasonable design (it has the advantage of being backwardsly compatible)
14:05:31 * TFK finishes off his cheese cake
14:05:43 <Heffalump> HBin?
14:05:49 <Lemmih> boegel: You managed to enter just after genneth left (:
14:05:55 <TFK> Haskell Pastebin (offline atm).
14:06:11 <Lemmih> TFK: That would be so coool.
14:06:13 <TFK> my 50 line CGI script with ugly HTML :-/
14:06:41 <TFK> Heh.
14:06:54 <boegel> Lemmih: why ? did he need me ?
14:07:10 <Lemmih> boegel: Yes.
14:07:17 <boegel> for what ?
14:07:17 <Lemmih> Don't know why, though.
14:07:21 <boegel> oh ok
14:07:43 <SamB> how well does setup configure --user work?
14:08:17 <boegel> heh
14:08:35 <boegel> the logs say his hard drive was killed when he clicked the link that starts the XP bug :s
14:09:09 <wilx> Which XP bug?
14:09:24 <boegel> <genneth>	damn him	17:44:19
14:09:24 <boegel> <xerox>	:(	17:44:27
14:09:24 <boegel> <genneth>	his comment early about that bug that causes a crash on windows	17:44:37
14:09:24 <boegel> <genneth>	that html/picture thing	17:44:42
14:09:24 <boegel> <genneth>	guess what i did with that link?	17:44:48
14:09:24 <boegel> <genneth>	i clicked it	17:44:51
14:09:26 <boegel> <SyntaxNinja>	nothingmuch: larry wall is a pervert.	17:44:53
14:09:28 <boegel> <genneth>	and then it promptly killed my work machine	17:45:01
14:09:30 <boegel> <SyntaxNinja>	anyone listening to HIM for tips on language design is wack	17:45:05
14:09:32 <boegel> <genneth>	completely killed the harddrive
14:09:34 <boegel> no fun :(
14:09:50 <boegel> I clearly stated "don't click this" , right ?
14:10:02 <wilx> Heh.
14:10:48 <basti_> thats a *really nasty bug*
14:10:51 <basti_> but wheres that url?
14:10:52 <basti_> :)
14:10:54 <wilx> Human nature. One has to burn his hand first to acknowledge that fire burns.
14:11:00 <vegai> does it work?
14:11:09 <vegai> hmm
14:11:21 <boegel> DO NOT click this: http://www.thq.nl/blue (makes WinXP crash)
14:11:55 <nothingmuch> hah, that's it?
14:11:57 <wilx> ...
14:12:00 <wilx> I almost clicked :D
14:12:05 <basti_> -g-
14:12:08 <astrolabe> So tempting
14:12:12 <wilx> Indeed.
14:12:14 <nothingmuch> just wget -O - it
14:12:25 <wilx> Is there anywhere any explanation about what it does?
14:12:30 <wilx> Is it IE bug?
14:12:32 <vegai> I wonder what in Deity's name makes that happen
14:12:40 <nothingmuch> <img width="99999999" height="999999999" />
14:12:51 <nothingmuch> not 100% sure about the numbers
14:12:53 <boegel> nothingmuch: yep :)
14:12:58 <vegai> I meant what the hell did they screw up inside XP
14:13:01 <boegel> clearly XP doesn't handle that too well
14:13:02 <nothingmuch> not that it matters
14:13:18 <nothingmuch> does it allocate a matrix of (r,g,b,a) for that?
14:13:19 <boegel> nothingmuch: you forgot the src="..." part
14:13:23 <vegai> will it just allocate too much memory?
14:13:29 <boegel> vegai: probably
14:13:35 <boegel> you get a BSOD when you try it
14:13:37 <wilx> That shouldn't kill it :/
14:13:38 <boegel> ask genneth :p
14:13:55 * SamB sends off a PArrows patch
14:14:10 <vegai>  3960 vegai     15   0 45472  27m  17m S  0.0  5.4   0:01.85 konqueror
14:14:59 * vegai hands SamB a bow.
14:15:12 <nothingmuch> 399999920000004 bytes for a 4 byte matrix
14:15:26 <basti_> thats much, nothingmuch.
14:15:33 <boegel> nothingmuch: XP shouldn't allocate that much memory at all !
14:15:40 <nothingmuch> that's 363 terrabyte
14:15:44 <boegel> there are other ways to handle it
14:16:01 <nothingmuch> boegel: i have no clue what it actually does
14:16:04 <SamB> I'm afraid I neither have the archery to shoot an arrow all the way to Helsinki, nor do I know where they keep the mailboxes there.
14:16:07 <nothingmuch> that number doesn't even fit in 32 bit space
14:17:04 <TFK> lambdabot is online! :D
14:17:23 <boegel> nothingmuch: it's just crazy
14:17:32 <boegel> if you're in linux or whatever, try the link
14:17:35 <boegel> works fine
14:17:54 <astrolabe> xp only seems able to allocate 2G to a process despite 2^64 being 4G.  I wonder if someone missed off an unsigned.
14:17:55 <basti_> various daring windows users report it to work on their systems
14:18:00 <vegai> does it really work on every browser inside windows?
14:18:10 <basti_> without a crash that is
14:18:11 <vegai> basti_: yep, I got those too
14:18:19 <nothingmuch> ff too?
14:18:45 <wilx> astrolabe, that is because process' memory is divided into user accessible 2G and kernel accessible 2G.
14:19:09 <astrolabe> Ah thanks wilx
14:19:25 <boegel> vegai: yes, ff, ie, no matter what
14:19:35 <boegel> it has something to do with the way xp wants to render it
14:19:43 <vegai> yeah
14:19:51 <vegai> I wonder if they can even fix that easily
14:20:02 <wilx> There is some switch that you can add to your boot.ini that allows you to use 3G and leaves kernel with only 1G to use.
14:20:08 <wilx> Something like /3G or /3GB.
14:20:31 <astrolabe> Oh that could be v useful.  Thanks!
14:20:52 <goron> boegel: That's a cool trick.
14:21:06 * goron crashed one computer.
14:21:07 <boegel> goron: trick ? :D
14:21:16 <boegel> heh, I told you not to click it
14:21:29 <boegel> I just read it on some news page though
14:21:30 <goron> boegel: I didn't believe you.
14:21:40 <boegel> goron: you do now? :)
14:21:40 <goron> boegel: FireFox doesn't kill WinXP.
14:21:45 <boegel> I haven't tested it
14:21:55 <boegel> yeah, some people say it doesn't crash, even with IE
14:22:03 <boegel> but it does slow the machine down bigtime
14:22:23 <goron> Probably there's some hidden api being called.
14:22:23 * astrolabe applauds goron's experimental temperment
14:22:28 <boegel> I don't even have _that_ in linux, so which OS is superior ? :) easy...
14:24:27 <norpan> hey, that was a big blue picture
14:24:40 <norpan> different shades of blue even
14:25:20 <boegel> norpan: yep :)
14:25:42 <goron> boegel: I never had seen a BSOD before on Windows XP (except during install)
14:25:45 <boegel> I hope genneth isn't pissed off at me :s
14:25:55 <boegel> goron: neither have I
14:26:03 <boegel> oh yes, once, on my gf's laptop
14:26:06 <norpan> time too sleep
14:26:08 <boegel> that was quite strange
14:28:17 <goron> astrolabe: thx.
14:33:09 <TFK> This is interesting. On my build, lambdabot needs user-prodding to "flush" its output.
14:34:12 <SamB> hmm, wonder why GHC is inferring 'loop :: MD [Instr] Stmt', but I can say 'loop :: MD i Stmt' and it doesn't complain...
14:39:59 <boegel> ... Microsoft Shell (MSH), codename Monad ...
14:40:00 <boegel> omg :)
14:41:34 <SamB> yeah, that is going to be confusing
14:41:49 <SamB> unless they give it a REAL name, anyway
14:42:44 <boegel> it won't be in Longhorn, that's the latest buzz
14:47:20 <Lemmih> nibro: Ping.

14:53:22 <Lemmih> I wonder how stupid we look in non-mono fonts...
14:53:34 <TFK> IRC Pong already exists in bash, though.
14:53:40 <Heffalump> you look pretty stupid in a mono font..
14:53:46 <TFK> More innovation!
14:53:58 <Lemmih> Heffalump: (:
14:56:28 <boegel> Heffalump: shut up, you're make me lose my concentration :p
15:02:33 * boegel goes to bed
15:02:41 <Lemmih> Night, boegel.
15:02:48 <boegel> when genneth shows up, tell him it's not my fault :p
15:02:54 <boegel> g'night ;)
15:11:17 <wilx> Hmm, is there some magic behind arrows or is ist completely translatable into ordinary Haskell like monads?
15:16:18 <mikael> no magic, as far as I know
15:16:39 <mikael> well, the arrow _syntax_ requires a compiler extension (or a preprocessor)
15:43:07 <TFK> Prelude> let cyc pat = cycle $ concat [replicate n bit | n, bit <- zip pat (cycle [1,0])] <--- complains that 'n' is not in scope - but why?
15:45:46 <wilx> (n, bit) maybe?
15:46:09 <TFK> Ah, genius :-)
16:05:01 <TFK> Funny, the Python solution is almost identical.
16:06:25 <SamB> TFK: um, that would be ordinary guards
16:06:40 <TFK> sorry?
16:07:00 <SamB> nevermind, that is a list comprehension...
16:07:25 <SamB> oh, I get it.
16:07:38 <TFK> :-)
16:07:42 <SamB> It tries to use n as a Bool on right of the |
16:08:20 <SamB> @plugs 1, 2
16:08:27 <lambdabot> (1,2)
16:08:43 <SamB> hmm, I didn't know that was even valid Haskell!
16:08:50 <TheHunter> it's not.
16:08:59 <SamB> TheHunter: oh, right
16:09:15 <SamB> @plugs \x -> x) (1
16:09:17 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `String' against `t -> t1'
16:09:53 <SamB> that is REALLY invalid syntax...
16:10:12 <TheHunter> @plugs \x -> [x]) ('a'
16:10:13 <SamB> but all I get is a type error :-(
16:10:14 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `String' against `t -> t1'
16:10:34 <SamB> @plugs "foo") ('a'
16:10:36 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `String' against `t -> t1'
16:11:05 <SamB> @plugs )(
16:11:06 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `String' against `t -> t1'
16:11:14 <SamB> @plugs )()(
16:11:16 <lambdabot> Couldn't match `String' against `t -> t1'
16:11:38 <TheHunter> ... "(take 2048 (show ("++s++")))" ...
16:14:45 <SamB> hmm.
16:15:26 <SamB> @pl \x y -> y $ x
16:15:28 <lambdabot> flip id
16:15:49 <SamB> arg, I want that in infix...
16:21:50 <shapr> SamB: define a new op? $- or something?
16:22:23 <SamB> shapr: but that won't help me play games with @plugs :-(
16:22:27 <shapr> oh right
16:22:51 * Heffalump wonders if anyone has any idea how much ICFP will cost
16:22:59 <SamB> on a more serious note, I don't see any laws for ArrowZero and ArrowPlus...
16:36:28 <shapr> SamB: PArrows works fine for me, what's the problem you're having?
16:44:54 <mike80> another question from my totally clueless self :) how would i got about constructing sth like x * y with the data constructors in Template Haskell. I know that x would be VarE (mkName("x")), and likewise for y. But how can i assemble the complete term?
16:46:17 <shapr> I really should have finished my Template Haskell tutorial.
16:46:25 <shapr> But not tonight...
16:46:43 <Lemmih> mike80: [||] is your friend.
16:47:18 <mike80> i thought [| |] wouldnt mix well with the data constructors, since [| |] creates an Q Exp
16:47:27 <mike80> while VarE etc. creates an Exp
16:48:33 <Lemmih> Prelude Language.Haskell.TH> runQ [| $(varE (mkName "x")) * $(varE (mkName "y")) |] >>= print
16:48:37 <Lemmih> InfixE (Just (VarE x)) (VarE GHC.Num.*) (Just (VarE y))
16:49:27 <mike80> great idea using the print command. that 'll solve any similar questions in the future
16:49:28 <mike80> many thanks
16:49:50 <Lemmih> You're welcome. (:
16:52:32 <dcoutts> TFK, yes the memory game needs a minor patch to work with 0.9.8, we didn't break many APIs,but just enough to stop that program from compiling. I should send boegel a patch.
16:58:59 <SamB> why is it that parsing is such a common example of combinator libraries?
16:59:24 <Heffalump> cos it's a nasty problem without them?
17:17:40 <SamB> what would you call a library based on "D. Swierstra and L. Duponcheel. Deterministic, error correcting combinator parsers."?
17:18:50 <SamB> hmm, maybe I should take a cue from the filename somebody called this PDF by and call it Text.ParsingCombinators.LL1...
17:52:30 <kimbly> has anybody gotten Fran to work with ghc 6.4?
17:54:41 <kimbly> when I try to load it from inside ghci, I get "Could not find module 'Win32Key'"
17:55:44 <kimbly> I found that module in hugs and tried just copying it, but that started a whole chain of dependency chasing that ended with a relatively terse "link error" message
18:00:33 <SamB> @pl \(f,x) -> f x
18:00:34 <lambdabot> uncurry id
18:00:55 <SamB> ack! that is ugly. I wanted uncurry ($)!
18:01:45 <Heffalump> ($) is a specialised id..
18:01:50 <SamB> I know!
18:02:03 <SamB> sometimes I even SEE
18:02:38 * SamB supposes he should no better than to expect readable output from @pl
18:05:11 <SamB> are there binary search trees in the standard prelude? maybe Maps are what is meant...
18:07:24 <wagle> @plugs (+2) `id` 1
18:07:29 <lambdabot> 3
18:07:41 <wagle> 8-D
18:08:24 <SamB> think about it... (id f) ==> f, right?
18:08:42 <wagle> sure, i fully understand
18:09:05 * Lunar^ wonder how he can make proofs with Coq but never achieve anything on paper... :(
18:09:54 <wagle> think of it as that Coq cant achieve anything without you there to help it
18:10:19 <Lunar^> for sure... but I just never know what to write
18:10:29 <Lunar^> maths are so informal
18:12:45 <resiak> What exactly does @plugs do?
18:12:49 <dons> @help plugs
18:12:50 <lambdabot>  @plugs <expr>
18:12:50 <lambdabot> You have Haskell, 3 seconds and no IO. Go nuts!
18:12:51 <wagle> SamB: it was just the notion of using id as an infix operator..
18:13:13 <wagle> @help @pl
18:13:14 <lambdabot>  @help <command> - ask for help for <command>
18:13:16 <reffie> @ghc
18:13:18 <lambdabot>  Use -fglasgow-exts to allow GADTs
18:13:23 <dons> @help pl
18:13:24 <lambdabot>  @pointless <expr> - play with pointfree code
18:13:25 <resiak> I see.
18:13:49 <dons> "Use -fglasgow-exts to allow GADTs", such wise advice lambdabot
18:14:58 <Lunar^> dons: Are you aware of any bugs in GHC 6.4 linux/ppc that would prevent Yi from working?
18:15:20 <dons> yes!
18:15:23 <dons> you need to use -fasm
18:15:25 <Lunar^> dons: compiling with -fvia-C exhibits the keypad bug
18:15:34 <Lunar^> dons: and -fasm segfaults in __stginit_Main
18:15:40 <dons> oh.
18:15:53 <Lunar^> riot exhibits the same behaviour
18:15:56 <dons> 6.4.1 (i.e. current stable tree) should work with -via-C
18:16:02 <Lunar^> even without hs-plugins
18:16:08 <dons> yes, this bug affects all the ncurses programs
18:16:18 <Lunar^> -fasm segfault too?!
18:16:25 <dons> no, I don't know what that is
18:16:31 <dons> that's new to me
18:16:50 * Lunar^ has already to many things to do..
18:16:57 <Lunar^> I'll just wait GHC 6.4.1
18:16:58 <dons> hehe
18:17:24 <Lunar^> then I'll get back at packaging riot and yi for Debian
18:17:42 <dons> oh, cheers!
18:17:56 <dons> can you package from darcs repos?
18:18:03 <dons> I wonder...
18:18:05 <Igloo> It would probably be good to at least report the segfault to the GHC powerpc folk
18:18:07 <Lunar^> thanks to CosmicRay, yes
18:18:23 <Lunar^> Igloo: I wasn't able to make a test case :(
18:18:29 <dons> Igloo, definitely. Lunar^, wolfgangT should hear about this.
18:18:38 <Igloo> If you can't do better than the smaller of riot or yi then just send that?
18:18:44 <Lunar^> Igloo: (tried for one hour)
18:19:16 <Lunar^> I'll try to send a mail tomorrow
18:19:56 <Lunar^> Igloo: being a DD, you can access Debian PPC box, right?
18:20:07 <Igloo> right
18:20:28 <Lunar^> because I was worried that it could be related to my setup, and I don't have access to any other box currently
18:20:39 <Lunar^> PPC box, I mean
18:21:12 <Igloo> Does anything other than libncurses-dev and ghc6 need to be installed?
18:21:44 <dons> Lunar, you should be able to build yi or riot without hs-plugins and still get the bug, btw.
18:21:53 <dons> both can be built "static"
18:22:28 <dons> so factoring hs-plugins out might make the test case a bit simpler
18:22:30 <Igloo> You'd be better asking one of the GHC PPC guys to try reproducing it, though, as it'll be a few days before I do
18:23:01 <Lunar^> dons: good to know for Yi
18:23:20 <Lunar^> dons: I had to hack riot a lot to get it able to build with GHC 6.4
18:23:57 <Lunar^> but my eyes are closing, and I'm getting up in 4 hours
18:24:02 <Lunar^> let's see that tomorrow
18:32:04 <SamB> does /\ mean &&?
18:32:37 <dons> looks like a big lambda to me
18:32:46 <dons> i.e. type abstraction
18:32:59 <dons> it could be && though, from logic
18:33:00 <SamB> actually, I'm thinking the thing I am seeing is supposed to mean ||
18:33:27 <dons> isn't that: v
18:33:36 <SamB> dunno!
18:33:37 <dons> versus: ^
18:34:03 <SamB> well lets see, union is something like U
18:34:40 <SamB> okay, && it is...
18:35:04 <dons> yeah, so like ^
18:38:18 <Igloo> It might mean meet
19:37:05 <MachinShin> hey +
19:51:50 <SamB> @pl \op x -> (`op` x)
19:51:52 <lambdabot> flip
19:59:23 <wagle> neato
20:13:01 * Lemmih has been getting way to many segfaults lately.
20:16:01 <dons> :/
20:21:57 <SamB> did haskell used to support instance declarations on type synonyms with nonzero arity?
20:46:52 <Lemmih> @karma- bringert
20:46:53 <lambdabot> bringert's karma has been incremented
20:48:47 * Lemmih just spent four hours tracking down a bug.
20:49:34 <dons> i think there's either a bug in the msg, or a bug in @karma-
20:49:54 <Lemmih> @karma bringert
20:49:55 <lambdabot> bringert has a karma of -1
20:52:01 <Lemmih> Compiling with -Wall -Werror is great way to avoid bugs.
22:02:54 <SamB> is hugs really faster than GHCi?
22:03:17 <dons> didn't know that either, but isn't too surprised
22:03:28 <dons> ghci doesn't run optimised code, for one.
22:04:20 <SamB> what do you mean by "optimised"?
22:04:39 <SamB> (and where does it get unoptimised code from?)
22:05:05 <dons> ghci doesn't optimise the haskell src it evaluates
22:05:10 <dons> i.e. not -O flags are used
22:05:17 <SamB> well, yeah...
22:05:39 <SamB> I guess it depends on what functions you use and how you use them, hmm?
22:05:58 <SamB> and whether/how you've compiled modules that you have imported...
22:06:02 <dons> even if you add -O flags, they're ignored.
22:06:12 <dons> the compiled code makes a big difference
22:06:37 <dons> but interpreted ghci versus interpreted hugs, hard to say
22:57:55 <lightstep> @code
22:57:57 <lambdabot> Base.lhs: "int2Word2Int"  forall x#. int2Word# (word2Int# x#) = x#
22:58:24 <dons> hmm..
22:58:30 <dons> interesting
22:58:40 <autrijus> @code
22:58:42 <lambdabot> Real.lhs: _ ^ 0                =  1
22:58:59 <lightstep> @plugs 0 ^ 0
22:59:00 <lambdabot> 1
22:59:14 <autrijus> @plugs error "hey" ^ 0
22:59:16 <lambdabot> 1
22:59:39 <dons> we learn something new
22:59:49 <musasabi> I don't think that is very bad.
23:00:03 <dons> fine with me
23:00:08 <lightstep> most prelude functions are strict either in both parameter, or only in the first
23:00:49 <musasabi> As forall n in Num: n^0 == 1. (or the type breaks things)
23:02:48 <lightstep> @plugs Debug.Trace "foo" 4 4
23:02:49 <lambdabot> Data constructor not in scope: `Debug.Trace'
23:02:58 <lightstep> @plugs Debug.Trace.trace "foo" 4
23:02:59 <lambdabot> Variable not in scope: `Debug.Trace.trace'
23:16:00 * autrijus wonders if ccshan will be in icfp/hw2005
23:16:57 <autrijus> (having just read his paper linked from LtU)
