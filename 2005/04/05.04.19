00:15:24 <skew> Good morning #haskell
00:16:39 <Gahhh> good night, dude
00:17:52 <skew> I've decided that this is morning
00:17:58 <shapr> It is morning.
00:18:02 <skew> even though I'm in California
00:18:12 <shapr> Good morning #haskell!
00:19:04 <nhc98> hello
00:19:12 <skew> shapr: did you look at my thing about composing boxes
00:19:16 <rtega> morning #haskell
00:19:18 <shapr> good morning nhc98!
00:19:22 <CLxyz> technically it is morning isnt it?
00:19:36 <rtega> well, if you look at UTC it certainly is morning
00:19:46 <Gahhh> PDT is morning, technically
00:19:51 <Gahhh> 00:20
00:19:55 <rtega> mkay
00:20:02 <shapr> skew: Not yet, waiting for my brain to come online.
00:20:14 <rtega> in japan it's almost evening
00:21:31 <skew> In California this would be more conventionally considered late night, or early night seeing how late people stay up at Caltech. But, as I said, I've decided that this will be morning.
00:21:48 <nhc98> fmap toUTCTime getClockTime
00:21:50 <shapr> Any particular reasion you've decided this will be morning?
00:23:06 <skew> Well, I don't work very well if I don't have an uninterrupted block of time, so I wasn't starting stuff until after dinner
00:23:22 <Itkovian> meuning
00:23:35 <skew> By then I'm already getting tired and inefficient, so stuff takes longer, I get even more tired, it's a downward spiral
00:24:25 <skew> Classes are the easiest part of what I do, so I thought I would put them at the end of the day instaed
00:24:47 <shapr> I've had some success getting up at 5am and working for a few hours before anyone else is awake.
00:25:03 <skew> I find the logic compelling
00:26:43 <a5> "classes are the easiest part of what i do" - totally. but i bet a lot of people would hate your for saying that
00:27:11 <skew> anybody who compares the homework sets to the classes would agree
00:27:47 <a5> oh i thought you were including homework :)
00:28:25 <skew> I hear it's different in biology and such, but in math class is like "here, I'll walk you through this theorem". Reading the book is like "details of this theorem left as an excercise for the reader". Sets are like "yay, you get to invent all the constructions yourself. Share and enjoy!"
00:32:52 <a5> it was hard to switch between math classes and CS classes for me. the CS graders were horribly unimaginative. and always told me things weren't rigorous when they were. whereas math graders would do stuff like complete my interesting partial solutions in class the next day
00:33:34 <skew> classes could be the easiest part of my work if I took easier classes, but algebraic topology and Kip's physics class are just too intersting
00:34:34 <a5> yeah. i had a few legitimately hard classes. like 120 (2nd year abstract algebra). i should have taken algebraic topology.
00:35:00 <skew> I took one term of 120, but it was hard and didn't seem to add much over 5. 151 is really cool
00:35:09 <skew> It was funny when prefrosh came to watch
00:35:55 * pimaniac is listening.
00:36:33 <skew> How many high school students know cohomology?
00:37:11 <a5> when i was having trouble with 120 i asked Aschbacher if there was a book of "counterexamples in algebra" - like "counterexamples in {topology,analysis}" which exist. he said no, he'd never heard of those. but then the final was *all* counterexamples. i was like, thanks but a little late.
00:38:08 <Cale> http://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cdalmost/pdfs/pm444_lec.pdf if anyone cares to look at my algebra course notes. :)
00:38:35 <pimaniac> skew/a5 pardon the interruption, but how is Caltech?  sounds like you two attend
00:38:41 <skew> I like it
00:38:53 <a5> skew: i'm not sure i know cohomology
00:38:58 <skew> are you thinking of going there for something
00:39:02 <Cale> by the way, if anyone has any intuition for noncommutative rings, I'd appreciate it :)
00:39:10 <skew> a5: I'm not sure I do either :)
00:39:18 <pimaniac> well, currently im stuck in north california for monetary reasons :)
00:39:39 <skew> I mean, are you looking for schools for undergrad? grad school?
00:39:41 <pimaniac> when i do well, and get out, i am definitely getting a masters somewhere nice
00:39:45 <a5> i liked many aspects of caltech...
00:39:53 <pimaniac> grad school, sorry
00:40:02 <skew> financial aid at caltech is really great (at least for undergrads) if that's an issue
00:40:08 <a5> monetary reasons? i know people who paid less for CIT than they'd have had to pay at UCB...
00:40:21 <pimaniac> im paying CSU rates
00:40:27 <skew> I'm covering my tuition working two terms as a TA and getting a summer job
00:40:34 <pimaniac> fun
00:40:39 <shapr> I moved to Sweden, tuition is free here.
00:40:50 <a5> ... but i didn't like the undergrad culture. there is a sort of cultivated apathy. or was when i was there
00:41:25 <pimaniac> as in noone cares about CS or their school?
00:41:42 <skew> well, the CS department isn't too broad
00:42:25 <skew> I think their work in graphics is top-notch, but they have next to nothing in the kind of formal/algebraic/type thoery stuff that I like
00:42:44 <shapr> nhc98: Anything interesting happening in the world of 'Nearly a Haskell Compiler'?
00:43:05 <pimaniac> skew: gotcha.  so if thats an interest, caltech is not quite the best?
00:43:22 <skew> Cale: rings were never my stong point
00:43:32 <a5> pimaniac: correct
00:44:06 <pimaniac> a5: thank you
00:44:10 <nhc98> shapr: I recently started implementing concurrent threads
00:44:23 <shapr> oh nifty
00:44:35 <skew> pimaniac: I figured I would probably continue teaching myself most of my CS I learned anyway, but I could pick up lots of other science and math on the side
00:45:01 <skew> Actually, I don't know of many american schools that do really cool stuff
00:45:09 <nhc98> shapr: but it is only about 1/3 complete so far, and I ran out of spare time
00:45:15 <pimaniac> skew: right now, im completely self taught.  CSU Chico has an extremely negative undergrad culture
00:45:24 <skew> how so?
00:45:31 <pimaniac> bummer.  i kinda like the really cool stuff
00:46:19 <skew> I haven't really looked too hard, between getting into this stuff mostly after I was already at school, and deciding not to go for grad school just yet
00:46:30 <pimaniac> well, we keep killing undergrads through frats or alcohol
00:46:39 <shapr> Is your 1/3 implementation of concurrent threads in the cvs repo?
00:46:45 <pimaniac> and nobody in the CS department seems to care about what they learn
00:46:49 <a5> pimaniac: oh you're at chico?
00:46:56 <a5> that's the canonical party school
00:46:58 <pimaniac> a5: yay!  were famous!
00:47:18 * boegel says hi
00:47:37 <shapr> hoi boegel
00:47:39 <a5> hi boegel
00:47:52 <shapr> boegel: Did you make it to your 8am class? ;-)
00:47:53 <pimaniac> a5: yeah, but somehow i didnt expect it to be this... bad
00:48:01 <pimaniac> hi boegel!
00:48:09 <boegel> shapr: nope :)
00:48:27 <boegel> I stayed in bed and took a shower like 5 min ago
00:48:31 <nhc98> shapr: No, the 1/3 that's done relies on some of the stuff that isn't, hence it is in an inconsistent state.
00:48:56 <skew> pimaniac: my alternate plan was to go to my state school and budget approx 5min a week per CS class, and have plenty of time to learn neat stuff
00:49:36 <a5> should i (a) write a super-general parser (b) write a test MUA interface
00:49:41 <shapr> Is there a short description of your concurrent thread implementation somewhere? I'm always interested in implementation approaches.
00:50:04 <pimaniac> skew: if i parsed that right, i was thinking of something similar.  im starting to compile long lists of books to read to bootstrap an education
00:50:16 <skew> a5: what for?
00:50:22 <skew> pimaniac: TaPL is a great book
00:50:22 <nhc98> I have some notes to myself written on a sticky note :-)
00:50:27 * shapr laughs
00:50:35 <skew> nhc98: email it to shapr :)
00:50:47 <nhc98> Fortunately, an electronic sticky note - it's getting quite large already.
00:50:48 <a5> skew: which one?
00:50:50 <pimaniac> TaPL?
00:51:03 <skew> "a5> should i (a) write a super-general parser (b) write a test MUA interface"
00:51:15 <skew> pimaniac: Type and Programming Languages, by Pierce
00:51:33 <skew> Types and Programming Languages, that is
00:51:41 * shapr thinks attachment type x-paper/sticky-note
00:51:57 <pimaniac> cool.  its in a sticky note :)
00:53:23 <a5> oh i'm asking people to choose one, (a) or (b). the parser is for several things - i want to use my bayesian inference library to make a stochastic parser, and i want to have a parser for my shell which is able to ask for more lines, help with completion, etc.
00:53:46 <skew> What is "MUA"?
00:53:46 <a5> both of those require a parser over an arbitrary monad using an arbitrary MonadPlus backing i think
00:53:52 <a5> mail user agent
00:54:25 <pimaniac> combine the two, and use a bayesian library for spam filtering?
00:54:32 <shapr> oh I wrote one of those!
00:55:01 <a5> yeah but mine will be better :)
00:55:32 <shapr> That wouldn't be hard ;-)
00:55:46 <shapr> I only got 85% spam detection.
00:55:55 <a5> hard for you maybe :)
00:56:23 <shapr> Nah, I like good code.
00:57:46 <a5> pimaniac: oh just saw that. yeah. i don't know how good my library is though.
00:58:09 <a5> it's using "exact methods" which aren't very scalable
00:58:17 <shapr> In my usual random manner, I have the urge to write a peer to peer library in/for Haskell.
00:59:41 <a5> i think a good p2p system needs good distributed collaborative filtering
00:59:55 <a5> it's one of my motivations for going into machine learning instead of fp
00:59:57 <shapr> Yeah, that's my main interest as well.
01:00:22 <a5> machine learning?
01:00:24 <shapr> Specifically, I want to break my reliance on email, and that would mean dumping ICANN.
01:00:31 <shapr> Nah, collaborative filtering.
01:01:10 <shapr> So I've been thinking about a peer to peer DNS system that lets anybody claim any names on their computer, and overlap is just fine.
01:01:32 <skew> machine learning and this sort of social software is really cool
01:02:06 <shapr> If you have something like ant pheromones to rank name lookups, I don't think it would be subject to googlebombing.
01:02:56 <skew> I really like the idea of being able to decentralize things like the monetary system
01:03:14 <a5> i've been looking at Roweis' "Automatic Alignment of Local Representations" as a basis of a DCF system. well i was looking at my own similar idea, and then someone said that paper was relevant
01:03:49 <shapr> I'd like to decentralize wikis in a similar manner. Darcs for read-only wikis means you only pull what you want.
01:04:01 * shapr googles for that paper.
01:05:19 <a5> YW Teh seems like a real awesome statistician. or whatever he is
01:08:01 <shapr> Wow, that is neat.
01:09:14 <shapr> I don't immediately understand the math well enough to use it, but I do understand why I'd want to use it.
01:11:31 <skew> I'll have to look at that more closely and see how they get good global coordinates out
01:13:40 * boegel has to go
01:13:53 * shapr has to go to work
01:25:21 <dons> did malcom wallace just visit us?
01:27:22 <kosmikus> where?
01:29:05 <dons> here :)
01:29:15 <dons>  > 18:08 -- nhc98 [~malcolm@abbess.demon.co.uk] has quit []
01:40:19 <kosmikus> dons: yes, you're right, I missed that
01:45:53 <nibro> dons: how's your haskell-src-exts migration going? =)
01:51:44 <dons> been a bit swamped. but I want to move hs-plugins into darcs, then import haskell-src
01:51:54 <dons> do you depend on it?
01:53:56 <magr>  /msg NickServ IDENTIFY IRCphobia
01:54:05 <Lemmih> Bummer!
01:54:05 <magr> fuck
01:54:13 <magr> :)
01:55:06 <nibro> dons: not until I want to do a release :)
01:55:24 <dons> ok. soon soon.
01:56:11 <magr> password changed, so don't bother
01:59:54 <nibro> dons: cool :)
02:04:38 <TFK> Good morning, fellow Haskelleers!
02:04:58 <Lemmih> Morning, TFK.
02:08:29 <nibro> morning :)
02:27:32 <skew> Hello TFK
02:27:47 <skew> did you learn anything about monads while you slept?
02:28:02 <skew> I hope we didn't give you nightmares :)
02:28:26 <TFK> No nightmares, but no monads either :-/
02:28:43 <TFK> Today I do HTML tables, file i/o and config files.
02:28:58 <skew> how did you start doing Haskell?
02:30:41 <xerox> 'morning!
02:30:53 <TFK> Just wanted to learn a new language, I suppose.
02:33:44 <skew> that's always fun, and Haskell is about as new as you can get
02:34:17 <TFK> Well, that sounds a bit grand. If I actually succeed, it'll be my second language that I'll know well (=be able to write Useful Code (TM) in).
02:34:31 <skew> there are other things equally different from traditional imperative languages in other directions, of course
02:34:58 <musasabi> Is gtk2hs, wxhaskell or the cairo binding most suitable for a GUI app that mainly needs to draw graphs?
02:35:06 <TFK> Yup. I have no prior FP experience, too...
02:35:41 <skew> musasabi: I know I've had a lot of trouble figuring out wxHaskell, and most of what I've wanted to do is custom drawing
02:36:17 <skew> there are about four different sizes you can set and only one of them actually tells a panel that it needs to stay at least that big because you are drawing in it
03:19:35 <Philippa> 'lo
03:20:20 <skew> good morning
03:20:25 <Itkovian> hi
03:20:30 <Lemmih> Yo
03:21:08 <TFK> 'morn
03:21:10 <xerox> y0
03:22:00 <TFK> Say, does Flippi handle HtmlTables anywhere?
03:26:03 * Lemmih wonders if JaffaCake got his mail.
03:26:27 <JaffaCake> yes, all 500-odd messages of it (been away for a few days)
03:26:41 <JaffaCake> which one in particular? :)
03:30:50 <Lemmih> The one about me getting CVS commit permission.
03:34:34 <musasabi> Has anyone used HGL - how good is it for handling a decorated cyclic directed graph?
03:35:19 <Philippa> TFK: not atm
03:41:19 <TFK> Guess it's autodidact for me...
03:44:13 <TFK> Does anyone have any experience with HtmlTables, then?
03:49:48 <TFK> It appears that HtmlTable requires BlockTable, which resies in Text.Html.BlockTable. But I can't load two modules at once (I tried :also) in Hugs. Any ideas?
03:50:15 <TFK> *resides
03:51:19 <TFK> ah, n/m, got it
03:51:29 <TFK> :load Text.Html Text.Html.BlockTable :-/
03:52:26 <nlv11757_> DOH big endian trouble
03:52:51 <TFK> Well, it doesn't work. Also, BlockTable will overshadow some Text.Html functions if I *do* get it to work.
03:52:54 <TFK> Ideas?
03:53:32 <musasabi> import qualified or just some symbols.
03:56:08 <TFK> And how do I do this in Hugs?
03:56:42 <sond> has anyone built HaXml with ghc6.4 in cygwin?
03:57:19 <skew> TFK: I think you need to use fully qualified names in the interpreter
03:57:31 <skew> at least, GHCi doesn't seem to let you make qualified imports
03:58:01 <TFK> Well, what are the rules for using qualified names? Text.Html works without the need for any qualifiers.
03:58:45 <JaffaCake> GHCi accepts any qualified name on the command line without the need to import it - it's a convenience feature
03:58:55 <skew> If you have imported some module P.M you can refer to the names without any qualifiers, or as P.M.name
03:58:57 <TFK> And Hugs?
03:59:20 <TFK> I'm not using 'import', mind you, but :load.
03:59:34 <TFK> hmm
04:00:00 <skew> if you have imported two different modults P1.M1 and P2.M2, both of which define name, then name is now ambigous, and you can't use it anymore
04:00:12 <skew> so you have to use either P1.M1.name or P2.M2.name
04:00:18 <TFK> Well, I can use qualified names for Text.Html.*, but not for Text.Html.BlockTable.*
04:01:11 <skew> If you write import Package.Grandparent.Parent.Module as M then you can refer to things as M.name rather than Package.Grandparent.Parent.Module.name
04:02:54 <TFK> You're not listening. I'm in Hugs.
04:03:17 <skew> I already told you all you can do in Hugs is use fully-qualified names
04:03:46 <skew> or, you wan write a Haskell file with a qualified import in it and load that up
04:03:50 <TFK> Which don't work.
04:04:19 <skew> doesn't it? another reason to get GHC, I suppose
04:04:36 <skew> isn't there a package for your operating system?
04:05:15 <TFK> GHCi on win32 is a pseudo-DOS box, and I can't even select data to copy-paste.
04:05:26 <TFK> Plus, WinHugs was pretty colors.
04:06:53 <skew> Hmm, I forgot windows contributed its own suckage
04:07:24 <TFK> That's right, the authors should never care about the OS of their users.
04:07:30 <TFK> Users suck mostly anyway.
04:07:51 <skew> There's no good way to paste into a windows dos-box thing?
04:08:01 <TFK> Sure there is. Just not into GHCi.
04:08:41 <TFK> To be fair, the same goes for the Python interpreter on win32. But Python also comes with IDLE, which has a nice, colorized interpreter :-)
04:12:18 <skew> you can always use either interpreter to repeatedel reload a file updated in whatever fancy colorized, copy-pasting, 3D-graphics eyecandy editor you like :)
04:12:48 <skew> have you read the Hugs docs?
04:13:38 <TFK> Yup, I'm staring at the docs for :load. It allows for multi-module imports, but I'm not sure if they discuss the usage.
04:13:59 <skew> "import qualified Module" is the syntax to import only the qualified forms of names
04:14:28 <skew> which can be mixed like "import qualified Module as M" to import only the for qualified by your abbreviated module name
04:14:35 <TFK> And yes, that's how I'm using Hugs. But I can copy-paste errors from Hugs to the Wiki, if need arises.
04:14:46 <TFK> ERROR - Syntax error in expression (unexpected keyword "import")
04:14:47 <skew> You can't even copy text out of the ghci box?
04:15:31 <TFK> That's the idea, yes.
04:15:53 <skew> TFK: well, if you are running Hugs off a file you are editing, then you can stick the imports you want at the top of that file
04:16:01 <skew> it should all work out
04:16:45 <TFK> Well, if I run ghci from a dos-box (and not from the start-menu), apparently I can copy-paste o_O
04:16:59 <TFK> Yeah, I suppose I could do that.
04:17:30 <skew> see, none of the Haskell interpreters actually give you the full top level of the language
04:17:47 <skew> so you often need to work off a file anyway, if you want to play with data types or type classes
04:17:50 <TFK> Oh yes, I discovered that a while back.
04:17:57 <TFK> Yup.
04:17:59 <skew> apparently the same goes for facny namespace control on imports
04:18:22 <skew> I'm surprised Hugs won't let you use the fully qualified form of a name to disambiguate
04:18:26 <TFK> I've been struggling with this stuff for a few months now :-)
04:18:30 <skew> are you sure that's what you tried?
04:18:38 <TFK> I dunno, maybe it's me on crack.
04:19:19 <skew> GHCi will give a message like "Ambigous occurrence `foo'. It could refer to either `M1.foo' or `M2.foo'" if you try to use an ambigous name
04:19:25 <TFK> I *think* that's what I tried. But you know, it's the matrix and all.
04:19:31 <skew> but you can make it happy by typing M1.foo or M2.foo
04:19:44 <skew> it shouldn't be hard to try again
04:20:14 <skew> Text.Html.BlockTable is a bit long to type lots
04:20:34 <TFK> Text.Html> Text.Html.BlockTable.single 1
04:20:34 <TFK> ERROR - Undefined qualified variable "Text.Html.BlockTable.single"
04:20:42 <TFK> Yup.
04:20:49 <skew> you haven't imported the module Text.Html.BlockTable yet
04:20:56 <TFK> I'll try loading from my main file, and using from that.
04:21:00 <skew> at least, that prompt looks like you haven't
04:21:08 <TFK> Text.Html> :load Text.Html Text.Html.BlockTable
04:21:09 <TFK> Text.Html> Text.Html.BlockTable.single 1
04:21:09 <TFK> ERROR - Undefined qualified variable "Text.Html.BlockTable.single"
04:21:28 <skew> are you sure that :load got both modules?
04:21:33 <TFK> Yeah, it's weird. It says the last module to be loaded will become the main module, but it doesn't do this.
04:21:47 <TFK> I'm not sure, but it doesn't bork, so I assume it does.
04:21:52 <skew> try e.g. :load Data.Maybe Data.Either, and then type in either
04:22:06 <skew> hmm, I guess that doesn't come from Data.Either
04:22:17 <TFK> heh, yeah
04:22:42 <skew> okay, try :load Data.Either Data.Maybe and then type catMaybes
04:23:02 <TFK> Hmm, this is weird...
04:23:27 <TFK> works.
04:23:42 <skew> I think I had trouble getting hugs to load more than one module at once when I was using it
04:23:45 <TFK> Hmmm, I put qualified imports in my main file, but Hugs will only respond to the first name.
04:24:10 <TFK> I have this in my file:
04:24:15 <TFK> import qualified Text.Html as H
04:24:15 <TFK> import qualified Text.Html.BlockTable as B
04:24:27 <TFK> Importing my file, Hugs responds to H.*, but not to B.*.
04:24:31 <TFK> o_O?
04:24:48 <skew> what if you switch them?
04:25:12 <TFK> No wait, it does respond, my bad
04:25:18 <TFK> bah.
04:25:27 <skew> also, try :load Data.Maybe Data.Char and see if both catMaybes and toUpper are in scope
04:25:29 <TFK> Well, I guess H. and B. is what I'll be typing now :-)
04:25:49 <TFK> heh, catMaybes isn't.
04:26:18 <TFK> Data.Maybe.catMaybes isn't, either. Meh.
04:26:31 <TFK> Think I should prod the Hugs people?
04:26:35 <skew> I don't thing Hugs lets you have the exports of a set of modules all in scope at the same time, at least not with :load
04:26:54 <TFK> Well, it should be able to provide syntax for qualified names then, no?
04:26:57 <skew> with GHCi you can use :m + Module.To.Add to bring stuff from an additional module into scope
04:27:09 <skew> and qualified names work fine
04:27:19 * TFK shrugs
04:27:51 <TFK> Well, thanks for the suggestion about importing from Main :-)
04:29:07 <Lemmih> TFK: You can use :also to load serveral modules and :module to switch between 'em.
04:29:44 <TFK> I need to use both at the same time.
04:29:55 <TFK> HtmlTable functions eat BlockTable structures, or something.
04:33:40 <skew> TFK: why do you need Text.Html.BlockTable anyway?
04:34:38 <TFK> mkHtmlTable :: BlockTable (Int -> Int -> Html) -> HtmlTable ; renderTable :: BlockTable (Int -> Int -> Html) -> Html ; HtmlTable (BlockTable (Int -> Int -> Html))	
04:34:42 <skew> it looks like cell, Text.Html.above and Text.Html.beside should be enough
04:34:59 <TFK> There's also HTMLTABLE, and I'm not sure exactly what it is.
04:35:18 <TFK> hmm
04:35:32 <skew> it's a class of things that can go in HtmlTable, I think
04:35:41 <TFK> cell takes an HTMLTABLE.
04:35:48 <skew> cell can turn Html into a table entry (see instance HTMLTABLE Html)
04:36:07 <skew> and there's an instance HTML HtmlTable for turning an HtmlTable back into Html, I think
04:36:08 <TFK> Hmm.
04:36:22 <TFK> Well, let's see...
04:36:32 <skew> maybe HTML is only for making things into html
04:36:45 <TFK> Ah, yes, cell works!
04:36:53 <skew> still, there's some way of rending an Html
04:37:09 <TFK> Yeah, I have some working HTML code already.
04:37:18 <skew> did you ever learn how type classes work?
04:37:43 <TFK> I read the Gentle chapters five times. But that was two weeks ago!
04:37:50 <TFK> I should reread them, eh?
04:38:09 <skew> make some of your own
04:38:23 <skew> just stupid little things to try them out
04:39:05 <TFK> I'm already doing a "stupid little thing" to learn Haskell :-) (the pastebin)
04:39:09 <skew> class Total a where total :: a -> Int, instance Total Int where total = id, instance (Total a, Total b) => Total (a,b) where total (a,b) = total a + total b, etc.
04:39:43 <skew> even if you don't need to make your own typeclasses to make your program work, a whole lot of interfaces in Haskell are specified with them
04:40:09 <TFK> So I need to know how to read type class/instance declarations, yes.
04:40:26 <skew> I think that was part of your problem with this BlockTable stuff
04:40:45 <TFK> Very likely :-/
04:41:44 <JohnMeacham> Hello
04:42:11 <TFK> On the other hand, I learned that multiple imports may not behave well...
04:42:21 <skew> hi
04:42:27 <TFK> g'day
04:43:10 <skew> TFK: I think multiple "import"s work fine, just not trying to load multiple modules in Hugs
04:43:18 <TFK> Oh yes.
04:43:26 <TFK> For a lot of my purposes, it's the same, though.
04:43:33 <TFK> :-/
04:43:37 <skew> GHCi handles it fine...
04:43:49 <TFK> Remind me again when I'm using Ubuntu.
04:44:07 <TFK> *when I'll be in ...
04:45:09 <Lemmih> Hey JohnMeacham.
04:45:41 <Lemmih> Not a very creative handle (:
04:47:34 <JohnMeacham> I gave up on psuedonyms :)
04:47:56 <skew> JohnMeacham: I hear you're living in Pasadena and doing some kind of work involving Haskell.
04:48:07 <JohnMeacham> I don't usually use IRC, on gale we always use full names (pretty much)
04:49:13 <JohnMeacham> I am living in Pasadena. My Work doesn't involve Haskell, but my fun does. I am about to make an announcement on the haskell list and thought I'd see if there was any reaction in the IRC channel before I fell asleep.
04:50:33 <skew> Okay. I'll be graduating from Caltech this year, so I'm a bit interesting in the jobs nearby. (I
04:50:38 <skew> (I've already got one, though)
04:51:33 <JohnMeacham> Feel free to have a preview: http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc
04:52:21 <JohnMeacham> cool. you should join gale, (gale.org) a lot of extechers and caltechers are there. unless you are already someone I know. silly psuedonyms :)
04:52:39 <skew> I'm not on gale yet
04:52:40 <JohnMeacham> by caltechers I meant haskell users
04:57:20 <skew> this looks pretty interesting.
04:57:39 <skew> How hard would it be to extend your Haskell with some form of dependent types?
04:58:08 <JohnMeacham> Not hard at all. in fact it was written with that in mind, it would be a pure front end change. the whole middle/back end is written with it in mind
05:00:03 <JohnMeacham> Basically, anything you can embed in the lambda-cube. which includes the calculus of constructions so should be good enough for any of the forms of dependent types I have heard about.
05:03:29 <JaffaCake> JohnMeacham: just took a look - cool!
05:05:13 <JohnMeacham> Thanks.
05:06:06 <skew> how hard would it be to fall back to the dictionary passing transformation for the standard libraries, to be able to compile them separately?
05:06:30 <skew> Are you looking for contributors?
05:06:51 <TFK> Heh, this almost works!
05:06:55 <JohnMeacham> that is not the main reason there is no seperate compilation. The transformation that disposes of all indirect function calls is the main one.
05:07:12 <JohnMeacham> Boquist's thesis (or his summary papers) give the details.
05:07:30 <JohnMeacham> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~boquist/
05:08:10 <JohnMeacham> this is probably the best overview paper  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~boquist/ifl96-abstract.html
05:08:58 <skew> before I've read that, what I really mean is how hard would it be to fall back to standard techniques for the standard libraries to avoid recompiling them (mod deciding some things would benifit from it)?
05:09:49 <JohnMeacham> Although, I should say that I am not escewing seperate compilation alltogether, just object code / standard linker. jhc has its own "seperate compilation" units called 'ho' files (for haskell object) which contain a different sort of info.
05:10:31 <JohnMeacham> it would be quite difficult to do any sort of  traditional seperate compilation.
05:10:32 <TFK> Hmph. I can't seem to figure out how to get <td> tags o_O
05:10:54 <TFK> For some reason, cells are glued together in one big <tr> but no <td>.
05:11:31 <JohnMeacham> I plan  on making it as fast as a seperate compilation based compiler. That is part of the challenge! currently I have two different algorithms which I am working on which should do the trick.
05:11:33 <TFK> I can get multiple <tr>'s, though.
05:12:45 <TFK> Ah, td function
05:12:48 <TFK> o_O
05:13:22 <JohnMeacham> But it is quite possible to compile each 'ho' file seperately, then run jhc once as a 'custom linker' of sorts. Of course, right now that custom linking phase will take up most of the time of compilation. But that is one of the things I am working on. (moving more transformations to the beginning phases)
05:14:21 <TFK> Huh?... there are table and td functions, but no tr function, and also HtmlTable?... what's the idea here?
05:14:52 <TFK> Oh wait, there is tr.
05:14:54 <skew> From what your page describes, it sounds like every use of a class method would need to be recompiled if the user code adds another instance. and any higher order function would need to be recompiled if the user code passes in a new functional argument.
05:17:20 <JohnMeacham> Yes, in that new object code will need to be generated. but that doesn't mean it can't store a lot of useful stuff between runs to speed up compilation.
05:18:47 <TFK> Now I have to align it properly.
05:20:17 <JohnMeacham> And in actualliti, the worker-wrapper transform described in the unboxed values paper and CPR papers for GHC are exactly what is needed to minimize this sort of recompilation. The worker often works on strict or known values and is needed once. the wrapper is inlined everywhere anyway so calling a function with a new higher order argument won't hurt.
05:20:54 <musasabi> Couldn't typeclasses for unknown code be done via existentials?
05:20:56 <JohnMeacham> (assuming it was able to be efficiently worker-wrapperized, which is _often_ the case)
05:21:36 <nlv11757_> isnt that boquist stuff abandoned?
05:21:46 <JohnMeacham> by him.
05:21:50 <nlv11757_> i remember being told that he just let it be
05:22:27 <JohnMeacham> Oh, jhc is my own work. it just uses a lot of ideas of his so his papers make good references.
05:22:41 <nlv11757_> also, quite some of these transformations and the order in which they worked seemed kind of magic to me. No real explanation as far as i remember
05:23:06 <JohnMeacham> Have you read about GHCs transformations :) just as magic.
05:24:05 <nlv11757_> heeh that doesnt mean its ok
05:24:09 <nlv11757_> :)
05:24:48 <JohnMeacham> Most of them are actually analogs of standard functional or SSA form transformations. The beauty of grin code is that it is isomorphic to both SSA and functional form which is wonderful because optimizations from both worlds can be used. As with GHC, useful transformations are figured out by examining generated code and realizing inefficiencies. there isn't really a better way to do it....
05:25:57 <nlv11757_> i wish i had more courses where we jointly read phd theses
05:25:57 <JohnMeacham> In his full thesis he shows more how the transformations work in concert with each other to good effect. Of course, he spends a lot of time talking about the register allocator which doesn't interest me as much because I prefer to leave that to gcc for now (but hopefully a cminusminus compiler in the future)
05:26:30 <JohnMeacham> Now it should be obvious why I chose the books I did to put in the Haskell Bookstore :)
05:26:48 <Muad_Dibler> .
05:27:29 <nlv11757_> .?
05:28:04 <skew> how is the performance now?
05:29:07 <JohnMeacham> compilation takes about 2-10 minutes on my system. less if you have 'ho' files sitting around from a previous build.
05:29:38 <skew> How does the generated code perform?
05:30:20 <JohnMeacham> as for the generated code, it is hard to make comparasions so far, only about 70% of the nofib suite compiles and comparing it to GHC wouldn't be fair until my region inference algorithm is up to snuff. What it definitly does well now is compile for code size, producing executables a tenth the size of ghc.
05:31:02 <nlv11757_> you built that compiler completely by your self?
05:31:29 <JohnMeacham> I have not implemented most of GHCs global transformations, so I don't expect good/comparable performance yet. I was working on getting the backend and all the other 'new' stuff working first before I started redoing what GHC has done.
05:32:12 <kosmikus> JohnMeacham: HCAR, please :)
05:32:46 <JohnMeacham> pretty much. everything except for parts of the front end, which is based on hatchet. oddly enough, I was able to greatly extend hatchets features while cutting out about 5k lines of code. (mainly due to Data.Generics)
05:33:01 <TFK> http://tfk.is-a-geek.org/ <--- now all that is left is file i/o!
05:33:25 <TFK> (it doesn't save anything atm)
05:33:55 <JohnMeacham> Pulling my changes out into a hatchet v2 would probably be a useful task. I am not sure if it is still being developed.
05:35:15 <TFK> Is there any kind of built-in config file format in Haskell? Or do I have to roll my own?
05:35:35 <JohnMeacham> oh. and the standard libraries are a mix of my, ghcs and nhcs code. There are only so many ways you can define 'head'
05:35:36 <dcoutts> JohnMeacham: re: jhc release; it'd be easier for packagers (like myself) if you made a tarball with a specific version number. It makes it easier for us (since we don't have to make a darcs snapshot) and it helps users since we can talk about which version we are using.
05:36:35 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, the reason I didn't do that is it is not really ready for packagers IMO. just people who want to hack at it or look at the source. a
05:36:53 <dcoutts> JohnMeacham: I was just about to do a Gentoo ebuild
05:37:03 <JohnMeacham> But I will do so at some point in the future.
05:37:18 <dcoutts> ok then, I'll leave off :-)
05:37:30 <JohnMeacham> Probably not worth it. Yet :)
05:37:37 <musasabi> TFK: you can either use your own, but e.g. MissingH has a config file parser.
05:37:47 <kosmikus> dcoutts: I have darcs.eclass, but it's unofficial
05:39:06 <musasabi> kosmikus: that would be quite nice, to e.g. get darcs-unstable.
05:39:16 <dcoutts> kosmikus: could I have a copy?
05:39:39 <kosmikus> wait a moment
05:40:33 <dcoutts> musasabi: I think you misunderstand, it's not for getting the lastest version of darcs but to download and build some program from a darcs repo, similar things exist for cvs/svn etc
05:41:11 <musasabi> dcoutts: yes. And that would be nice for getting the latest version of darcs.
05:41:39 <dcoutts> musasabi: right, ok I misunderstood what you said.
05:41:47 <musasabi> np
05:42:32 <kosmikus> dcoutts, musasabi: dev.gentoo.org/~kosmikus/darcs.eclass
05:43:08 <musasabi> thanks
05:43:34 <TFK> musasabi, thanks, will look into it
05:53:57 <JohnMeacham> Well, I am off to bed. the birds are chirping and it is getting light out.
05:56:12 <TFK> Right, don't want to disintegrate when the sun comes out :-P
06:08:51 <kosmikus> dcoutts, musasabi: also, dev.gentoo.org/~kosmikus/darcs-darcs-1.0.2.ebuild (this isn't for unstable, but it should be trivial to adapt)
06:10:26 <CosmicRay> Hello.  I would like to talk about file locking in haskell.  Apparently, the only locking available is mandatory locking -- open a locked file and you get an exception.
06:10:48 <CosmicRay> I would like more traditional flock-style locking for my application -- block until the file is unlocked
06:10:56 <CosmicRay> I don't seem to see anything in the library that can do that though
06:10:59 <CosmicRay> am I missing something?
06:13:43 <musasabi> CosmicRay: I would just use foreign import.
06:13:59 <CosmicRay> you think it would play nice with haskell handles?
06:14:02 <nlv11757_> does someone know what they are after here; "if you print -2147483648 then this is two tokens in C"
06:14:16 <musasabi> CosmicRay: use that on a lock file..
06:14:23 <musasabi> and then handles.
06:14:27 <CosmicRay> ah, that would work, yes.
06:14:57 <musasabi> but I think that using flock(2) with the Fd would also work.
06:15:00 <CosmicRay> but that's a bummer that it's not in the library already
06:15:34 <musasabi> file locking is very OS specific...
06:17:16 <jyp> nlv11757_: I think
06:17:38 <jyp> can you elaborate ?
06:33:20 <nlv11757_> jyp: i dont get what they mean
06:33:26 <nlv11757_> im not a big C guru/fan
06:33:32 <nlv11757_> so i dont know what they mean
06:33:43 <jyp> Ok, iiuc; the two tokens are
06:33:50 <jyp> "-" : unary operator
06:34:10 <jyp> 2342134 : literal decimal constant
06:34:18 <nlv11757_> hmmm
06:35:02 <ibid> nlv11757_: what is the context?
06:35:12 <nlv11757_> the comment is in front of a pretty printer that pretty prints 64 bit integers (they store all integer types; unsigned int, unsigned short, etc. in a 64bit int)
06:35:28 <nlv11757_> that pretty printer should print it to valid C again
06:35:43 <ibid> is it the sole comment?
06:35:55 <nlv11757_> maybe i should paste it
06:36:02 <nlv11757_> although is not haskell :P
06:36:04 <nlv11757_> but ocaml
06:36:09 <nlv11757_> its about C
06:36:18 <nlv11757_> @paste
06:36:19 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
06:37:02 <ibid> anyway, the comment is correct in the -42 is two tokens in c
06:39:56 <nlv11757_> ok i pasted it on the haskellIrcPastePage
06:39:57 <nlv11757_> its on top
06:40:13 <nlv11757_> i dont quite get why they are handling these int64 so special
06:40:31 <nlv11757_> choosing the right prefix and suffix is clear...but what they start doing then.....
06:43:56 <ibid> it does not seem that int64 are handled specially, just that it's the largest type available
06:44:08 <ibid> but then again, i don't know ocaml :)
06:47:24 <Joachim_> 
06:47:29 <Joachim_> reset
06:49:27 <nlv11757_> ibid: what about all the special treatment with looking if its lower then 0, all that shifting stuff
06:49:33 <nlv11757_> doesnt look normal for me
06:54:21 <ibid> nlv11757_: it seems that the program we are reading represent certain large integers as negative numbers (in such a way that the unsigned number is a two's complement representation of the negative number)
06:54:51 <ibid> nlv11757_: and that code is undoing this encoding
07:00:29 <nlv11757_> whats a 'two's complement representation'
07:00:33 <nlv11757_> my english falls short here
07:01:40 <ibid> look it up
07:02:00 <ibid> i'm off catch the bus, bbl :)
07:06:15 <nlv11757_> bye thnks
07:08:03 <earthy> two's complement representation
07:08:39 <earthy> is an encoding of a finite range of integers
07:08:54 <bringert> Lemmih, XmlRpc is now in darcs at http://cvs.haskell.org/darcs/xmlrpc/
07:09:02 <bringert> I'll make anew release soon
07:09:06 <earthy> given n bits, it will let you encode -2^n .. 2^n-1
07:09:23 <earthy> err...
07:09:25 <earthy> that is n+1 bits, ofcourse
07:11:47 <Lemmih> bringert: Neat.
07:13:41 <nlv11757_> yeah i see it now, i actually new it, but not the name :D
07:15:33 <bringert> Lemmih: does the darcs version work for you?
07:16:14 <nlv11757_> still dont fully get all those shifts going on
07:48:36 <lightstep> is there a standard module like IntMap, but with O(1) access and contigous indices?
07:49:07 <tromp> arrays?
07:49:40 <lightstep> arrays are not resizable
07:54:40 <bringert> in Template Haskell, is there an alternative to the 'name notation?
07:54:56 <vincenz> if you invent a datatype that has O(1) and is resizable in O(1)....
07:55:09 <bringert> one which is about as easy, but closer to lexically correct haskell
07:55:12 <tromp> you'll be famous
07:55:15 * vincenz nods
07:55:56 <vincenz> actually if it only grows at the end one could envision O(1) and O(1) resizing
07:56:51 <tromp> you'll have to settle for amortized O(1)
07:56:59 <Philippa> vincenz: it's called a stack?
07:57:01 <vincenz> basically linked list of fixed size segments
07:57:23 <vincenz> Philippa: that's very nice and all if you look at it from an abstract point of view, but a stack needs implementation
07:57:42 <Philippa> I had one in mind. And it's already in common use outside FPLs
07:57:47 <Philippa> the only problem is you only get one of 'em :-)
07:57:51 <chr1s> g'afternoon everyone
07:57:55 * vincenz grins
07:58:20 <chr1s> I have this datatype: data Expr       = Const Double
07:58:21 <chr1s>                                                                                       |                deriving Show
07:58:56 <Philippa> and it doesn't work because there's nothing on the RHS of the | except the deriving bit?
07:59:04 <chr1s> but when I try to do :t Expr it says Data constructor not found
07:59:26 <Philippa> that's because a type isn't a data constructor
07:59:31 <Philippa> :t takes values, not types
07:59:40 <Philippa> :t Const will give a result, for example
07:59:43 <lightstep> i didn't mean O(1) resizing. i just wanted to know is there was some self-reallocing array in the ghc libraries, or if i should define it myself
07:59:54 <Philippa> :t Just and :t Nothing work, :t Maybe doesn't. That make sense?
08:00:34 <chr1s> ah
08:00:39 <chr1s> I get it
08:00:49 <vincenz> Prelude> let sum [] = 0
08:00:49 <vincenz> Prelude> let sum (x:xs) = x+(sum xs)
08:00:49 <vincenz> Prelude> sum [1,2,3]
08:00:49 <vincenz> *** Exception: <interactive>:1: Non-exhaustive patterns in function sum
08:01:34 <smott> the second def overwrites the first
08:01:51 <lightstep> you need three spaces instead of the second `let'
08:02:46 <vincenz> oh thank you
08:03:12 <vincenz> bope
08:03:14 <vincenz> nope
08:03:20 <vincenz> do I need an and?
08:03:25 <vincenz> or does this only work in files?
08:03:38 <Lemmih> let sum [] = 0; sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
08:03:55 <vincenz> thx
08:04:15 <tromp> note that sum is predefined in Prelude
08:04:25 <Lemmih> Or just 'let sum = foldl1 (+)'
08:04:28 <tromp> just like product
08:04:42 <vincenz> just experimenting with patternmatches
08:04:48 <vincenz> why foldl1? not foldl
08:05:04 <lightstep> 'cause with foldl you also need to specify the zero
08:05:07 <Lemmih> 'foldl (+) 0' is probably better.
08:05:11 <vincenz> ah
08:05:18 <vincenz> foldl1....does it always use 0?
08:05:25 <vincenz> what if you want to fold nonnumeric stuff, or make a product
08:05:37 <Lemmih> It fails on an empty list.
08:05:38 <lightstep> you don't use (+)
08:05:55 <Lemmih> @plugs foldl1 (+) []
08:05:57 <vincenz>  know...but foldl1
08:06:01 <lambdabot> Fail: Prelude.foldl1: empty list
08:06:01 <vincenz> it places the 0 there
08:06:05 <vincenz> oH!
08:06:11 * vincenz nods
08:06:18 <vincenz> seems more logical
08:08:13 <nlv11757_> looool
08:09:21 <nlv11757_> guy walks past another and asks "have you tried ocaml ?", the other guy says..."i took a look at it". "you must *try* it, but fine it's your choice. Continue with your horrible C"
08:10:23 <nlv11757_> gotta love it
08:10:24 <nlv11757_> :D
08:11:20 * Philippa hasn't tried ocaml yet, and will continue with her horrible Haskell
08:11:24 <Philippa> 'lo shammah
08:11:27 <Philippa> er, shapr
08:11:30 <musasabi> and the other guy continues to use with his/her horrible haskell?
08:11:35 <shapr> y0
08:11:39 <musasabi> hello shapr
08:11:51 <xerox> yo shapr
08:12:07 <musasabi> has anyone plugged the cairo binding to gtk2hs?
08:12:15 <musasabi> s/to/into
08:12:32 <nlv11757_> Philippa, it was a comment from someone that knows and loves ocaml to a person doing C
08:12:54 <nlv11757_> so not ocaml vs haskell
08:13:09 <CosmicRay> Philippa: there is probably no reason to learn ocaml if you are already working on haskell
08:13:10 * lightstep did the same, but gaim vs icq
08:13:18 <tromp> hi,
08:13:19 <musasabi> Ocaml has nice ideas but in practise I prefer Haskell. (or even SML to it)
08:13:19 <tromp>    _O
08:13:19 <tromp>    (`
08:13:19 <tromp>    |>
08:13:19 <tromp>   ,|.
08:13:19 <tromp>   `-'
08:13:22 <CosmicRay> There is nothing interesting about ocaml that haskell lacks
08:13:25 <shapr> tromp: whoa nifty!
08:13:29 <shapr> tromp: did you make that?
08:13:29 <CosmicRay> except maybe performance
08:13:34 <CosmicRay> tromp: what is that?
08:13:35 <nlv11757_> performance a lot might say
08:13:37 <tromp> stole it:(
08:13:52 <musasabi> GHC performance is not very bad.
08:13:53 <CosmicRay> nlv11757_: right but there is nothing interesting about the language if you are coming frmo haskell
08:13:54 <shapr> Where did you steal it from? I'd like to give proper credit :-)
08:14:07 <CosmicRay> musasabi: I agree, but ocaml outperforms even *gcc* at times.
08:14:11 <tromp> http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/uvw/unicycles.txt
08:14:12 <musasabi> Getting performance from intuitive readable code would be nice.
08:14:27 <nlv11757_> thats true cosmicray, thats why this guy was telling the C guy to start doing functional stuff. Ocaml in this case
08:14:28 <musasabi> CosmicRay: that is mainly due to the poor calling convention used by C.
08:14:29 <CosmicRay> musasabi: so would world peace :-)
08:14:29 <shapr> tromp: lovely!
08:14:35 <CosmicRay> nlv11757_: that makes sense
08:14:42 <tromp> the juggling one is cool:)
08:15:25 <nlv11757_> jeez, it didnt stop raining one minute :S
08:15:38 <nlv11757_> guess i'll be working late lol, im not going to bike in this weather
08:15:43 <tromp> those who like sportsmanship in cyclists should watch
08:15:44 <tromp> http://www.fietsenpagina.nl/filmpjes/films/olympicspirit.mpg
08:16:11 <shapr> JohnMeacham: y0!
08:18:32 <sylvan> jhc seems pretty neat...
08:18:37 <shapr> Yeah it does.
08:19:32 <nlv11757_> hehe figured tromp was dutch, fietsenpagina.nl :D
08:20:26 <nlv11757_> dutch dominate the recreative cycling department i think
08:20:51 <shapr> It's because you don't have mountains like .ch
08:23:18 <nlv11757_> true, holland is flat
08:23:43 <nlv11757_> so the only business you have while cycling is looking around instead of actually putting effort in cycling
08:24:08 <shapr> Right, biker in .ch get squished because they're too tired to look where they're going.
08:30:20 * shapr hops cheerfully
08:30:31 <shapr> I have an mp3 player that likes Linux! w00!
08:30:36 <musasabi> Has anyone been successful in building jhc?
08:30:53 <nlv11757_> what brand would that be shapr
08:30:58 <shapr> iRiver
08:37:16 <nlv11757_> which one is it?
08:38:30 <shapr> I have the IFP-899T 1GB player.
08:40:58 <shapr> I took the Sony Network Walkman back to the shop because it required windows and wouldn't play mp3 files.
08:44:16 <musasabi> We have a gembird kolibri clone, which works as a USB-1.1 mass storage device.
08:44:58 <nlv11757_> walkman does sound a bit eighties
08:45:26 <shapr> The iRiver works as USB mass storage device if you use the UMS firmware.
08:46:30 <nlv11757_> im well satisfied with my ipod. Even if i have to charge my battery every 10 hours
08:48:01 <Philippa_> I'm okay with my Zen Touch, but I use windows so I deserve what I get regardless
08:48:28 <earthy> iPod... iiiiiPod....
08:48:44 <nlv11757_> although im already running out of my 20gb in a week i guess
08:48:52 <earthy> I have about 6G free on mine
08:48:57 <earthy> (a 40G model ;))
08:49:02 <nlv11757_> :D
08:49:02 <Philippa_> same here, though it's a 20G
08:49:08 <Philippa_> I can always re-encode the lot at a lower rate though
08:49:11 <tuomov> I lost 4G on my 20GB (iRiver)
08:49:14 <nlv11757_> im not rich enough to get the 40gb version
08:49:16 * Philippa_ has a bad habit of ripping at 320
08:49:22 <earthy> that is a bad habit
08:49:26 <nlv11757_> hahaha philippa exactly the same here
08:49:32 * earthy goes for 192
08:49:39 <nlv11757_> im quit the freak when it comes to ripping his cd
08:49:45 <nlv11757_> s
08:49:53 <nlv11757_> i should have gone for 192 :D
08:50:11 <Philippa_> A "lossless" VBR'd do
08:50:12 <earthy> but then again, I'm almost always in environments noisy enough to drown out the mp3 encoding artefacts.
08:50:29 <nlv11757_> yeah usually they come around 256 kbits at average philippa
08:50:38 <Philippa_> depends what you're listening to
08:50:45 <nlv11757_> haha you have your own room earthy no?
08:50:53 <Philippa_> most of my collection's electronic, that tends to end up smaller
08:51:04 <earthy> have you heard the noise a Sun Ultra 10 makes?
08:51:22 <nlv11757_> here mostly metal/alternative/dnb
08:51:26 <earthy> or even a Dell?
08:51:37 <nlv11757_> yeah those Dells are noisy
08:51:39 <nlv11757_> true
08:51:57 <tuomov> too bad decent isolating earphones are quite expensive (and unavailable here in the middle of nowhere)
08:51:57 * TheHunter encodes to musepack.
08:51:58 <Philippa_> nlv11757_: house, trance, a bit of d'n'b, some nu skool breaks, various other bits and pieces
08:52:03 <earthy> but I don't have the money for the Sennheiser PXC 250 that I'd like
08:52:24 <tuomov> etymogics or the like..
08:52:25 <shapr> This isn't confidence inspiring - "Upgrading firmware, please wait. \n err:  [ifp_os_control_send] err=-110. error sending ifp control code the command 17 (0, 0). ctl[4]  Returned -110. \n err:  [ifp_control_send] err=-110. error sending control value \n Firmware upload in progress.  Please don't touch the device until after it turns itself off"
08:52:35 <tuomov> g=t
08:53:09 <nlv11757_> earthy, you have money for a 40gb version but not for a headphone :O
08:53:15 <nlv11757_> i need to see that headphone haha
08:53:29 <earthy> it's EUR 130, roughly
08:53:34 <nlv11757_> wow
08:53:38 <earthy> plus, I have Sennheiser earbuds
08:53:51 <earthy> not too bad, but they don't do active noise reduction
08:53:57 <earthy> which the PXC 250's do
08:53:57 <nlv11757_> is that a kind of thing M. Bravenboer always has on his head when i walk past the building :D
08:53:57 <shapr> Sennheiser is great.
08:54:16 <tromp> i wear one now
08:54:17 <TheHunter> nlv11757_, that's not too much for a decent headphone.
08:54:18 <tuomov> etymotics are $330/pair..
08:54:42 <nlv11757_> hunter: for that money, rely it has to be this huge thing right, not just earbuds
08:54:45 <earthy> tuomov: the sennheiser earbuds I own were the next step down from the etymotics back when I bought them. ;)
08:54:50 <nlv11757_> rely=really
08:55:02 <autrijus> wow. it runs.
08:55:03 <earthy> owh PXC 250's aren't earbuds
08:55:04 <Philippa_> all of which is no help if you're broke, of course
08:55:18 <shapr> autrijus: That's because you have the machete. Everything runs then.
08:55:19 <autrijus> simonpj++ # easily serializable continuations in GHC
08:55:23 <shapr> wah?
08:55:28 <nlv11757_> hahah im not broke, but im not about to 'throw away' 130 euros for a headphone
08:55:43 <autrijus> shapr: I ported over the code from "A Monadic Framework for Subcontinuations"
08:55:46 <autrijus> shapr: to GHC 6.4
08:55:47 * Philippa_ blinks
08:55:48 <autrijus> it Just Runs!
08:55:58 <earthy> subcontinuations?
08:55:58 <shapr> autrijus: ahem, is that in the svn repo?
08:56:00 <autrijus> just throw some unsafePtrEq and unsafeCoerce at it
08:56:26 <earthy> must not read more papers'
08:56:28 <earthy> must write
08:56:33 <earthy> (and go shop for food)
08:56:47 <shapr> nlv11757_: I've been looking at getting a pair like TheHunter has.
08:56:54 <tuomov> iriver (at least ihp-120) comes with some cheapo sennheisers that are actually quite tolerable for such cheapo bundled ones
08:57:11 <TheHunter> nlv11757_, well it's not that much considering you'll wear them a long long time.
08:57:35 <nlv11757_> gee, that pxc doesnt look that big for that amount of money
08:57:45 <nlv11757_> i will have that thing broke in no time
08:58:11 <shapr> nlv11757_: ever thought about the cost of CPUs by acre?
08:58:14 <TheHunter> fwiw, the HD600 is absolutely inbreakable.
08:58:24 <nlv11757_> probably i will cycle through the rain and that thing will stop working
08:58:28 <TheHunter> i must have thrown it on the floor like a million times.
08:58:43 <TheHunter> stupid cable...
08:58:44 <autrijus> now I need to work on CPST...
08:59:02 <tuomov> TheHunter: and a portable player doesn't have enough juice to run them..
08:59:33 <shapr> autrijus: Where can I find your subcontinuations port?
08:59:47 <shapr> I very much want serializable continuations for a Haskell webdev framework.
09:00:51 <autrijus> I think I need to write to ask the authors for license
09:00:59 <autrijus> even better if you can do that for me :)
09:01:32 <shapr> Sure
09:01:46 <autrijus> yay.
09:01:53 <autrijus> it's in Pugs now as Pugs.Cont.Prompt and Pugs.Cont.CPS.
09:02:03 <autrijus> if the license is clear, I'll port Pugs.Cont over to use them.
09:02:14 <autrijus> currently they will not be listed in manifest.
09:02:28 <shapr> I doubt they'll have any problems with that. SPJ and Amr Sabry are both nice people from what I've seen. I don't know anything about Kent Dybvig.
09:02:31 <TFK> yo shapr
09:02:39 * autrijus applies some more bleeding edge research to pugs
09:02:55 <shapr> y0 TFK
09:03:48 <TFK> I got the HTML part of the pastebin. I now have to do file i/o to save the data to disk, and then I can hook in syntax highlighting :-D
09:04:14 <Arsilan> YOYO, TFk yuo are cool
09:04:28 <TFK> So two more "iterations" and the pastebin will be kinda useful.
09:04:29 <autrijus> shapr: note that in that implementation, reify = pushSubCont
09:04:45 <TFK> That's what I'm saying all the time! But nobody believes :-(
09:04:46 <autrijus> well actually, according to the paper
09:04:58 <autrijus> reify k = \v -> pushSubCont k v
09:05:27 <autrijus> disregarding monomorphism though, the two forms are the same
09:07:10 <autrijus> shapr: also note it doesn't quite work on top of IO, so it's not "serializable" in any useful sense
09:07:13 <TFK> Also, Text.Html needs *a lot* of annotation.
09:07:29 <autrijus> shapr: I need to work on a reifiable transformer version
09:07:49 <glimming> Anyone can see what''s wrong with this TeX definition
09:07:51 <shapr> That would be particularly tasty.
09:07:51 <glimming> ! Missing $ inserted.

09:07:57 <glimming> ?
09:08:00 <glimming> Sorry for the out-of-topic question...
09:08:07 <shapr> You can ask on #latex
09:08:33 <shapr> TFK: spiffy!
09:09:14 <TFK> You can watch my "efforts" on tfk.is-a-geek.org (which may be down occasionally)
09:10:05 <shapr> TFK: nice!
09:10:53 <TFK> Encouragement, just what I needed :D
09:11:04 * shapr waves pom-poms!
09:11:07 <nlv11757_> hey tfk, you're not really a geek are you? :P
09:11:49 <lightstep> tfk, are there permanent links yet?
09:11:49 <TFK> Well, that depends on the definition! I don't watch Star Trek and don't have Star Wars action figures. Am I still in?
09:12:01 <TFK> Nope. I hope to get them down by the end of the day, though.
09:12:23 <lightstep> will it be foss?
09:12:27 <Philippa_> TFK: that doesn't rule you out - I don't do either myself...
09:12:30 <nlv11757_> hehe ok, as long as you're not walking in a chubacka suit daily you'll be safe :P
09:12:37 <TFK> Philippa_, weeeeee! :D
09:13:22 <nlv11757_> nice domain though
09:13:24 <nlv11757_> is it free?
09:13:32 <lightstep> tfk, also, it seems you are using &nbsp; instead of <pre>
09:13:34 <TFK> lightstep, sure, I'll release the code once it's useful, and once I make it perty.
09:14:00 <TFK> Yup.
09:14:05 <Cale> TFK: any luck with monads? :)
09:14:17 <TFK> I'm not really too good with HTML either, so I'm not sure how much freedom tag-wise <pre> provides :-/
09:14:29 <TFK> Another problem is word-wrap, pre doesn't have it.
09:15:03 <TFK> Cale, consider the fact that it took me two hours to figure out how to make tables :-/
09:15:10 <TFK> So no :-(
09:15:33 <lightstep> Text.Html is really not documented enough. it also uses too many infix operators
09:15:35 <TFK> nlv11757_, that's only the name; I got it from dyndns.org. The server is my own machine, running Apache.
09:16:02 <TFK> Yup. I was invited to annotate it :-/
09:16:14 <nlv11757_> owww ok
09:16:43 <nlv11757_> i still have a domain name for 2 years now and havent done anything with it yet lol
09:16:58 <lightstep> which?
09:17:42 <TFK> heh
09:19:06 <nlv11757_> psychopathic.nl
09:19:41 <TFK> Heh @ name...
09:21:55 <Cale> TFK: did you have a chance to look at my article?
09:22:14 <TFK> Nope. Not at the others, I'm afraid. I certainly will, though.
09:22:36 <TFK> Currently my brain is set on HTML :-/
09:22:48 <Cale> what did you need to know about PRE?
09:22:59 <Cale> <!ENTITY % pre.exclusion "IMG|OBJECT|BIG|SMALL|SUB|SUP">
09:23:07 <Cale> those are the tags you can't use inside PRE
09:23:30 <TFK> Oh.
09:23:40 <TFK> Heh, guess I'll move to <pre>, then :-)
09:24:13 <TFK> But now, I/O!
09:25:47 <TFK> hmmm. It seems that primHtml converts a string to HTML without parsing it o_O
09:26:25 <TFK> Which begs the question of why I didn't use it, but instead battled with HtmlTables and the like...
09:26:34 <SyntaxNinja> howdy
09:27:05 <lightstep> safety and extensibility?
09:27:39 <TFK> My code is neither safe nor extensible.
09:28:15 <shapr> Is there a recommended bps for speech that's Ogg encoded?
09:29:08 <lightstep> it ensures that the users won't throw junk at your server
09:29:50 <TFK> How? My HTML is (so far) independent of the input.
09:30:26 <lightstep> if you use primHtml on user input, she can screw everything up
09:31:04 <TFK> On the other hand, I have to create functions like joinBr, because join won't work anymore.
09:31:14 <TFK> (Of course I'll change it to <pre>, but still.)
09:31:33 <lightstep> even if you do it on your own, it can have funny interactions with the library's html output
09:31:53 <TFK> Possibly. So I guess I'll stick with HtmlTables :-/
09:31:58 <SyntaxNinja> JaffaCake: you missed mr nhc98 here yesterday :)
09:31:59 <lightstep> omg, i have tickets to a play in 40 min.
09:32:01 <lightstep> bye
09:32:08 <SyntaxNinja> heh
09:32:30 <TFK> ^_^;
09:32:33 <nlv11757_> omg it it still raining
09:32:46 <nlv11757_> how can i ever get freakin home if it doesnt stop
09:32:58 <TFK> I wish it were raining here :-/
09:33:28 <TFK> But it probably won't until ~November...
09:33:41 <SyntaxNinja> hi yoda-
09:33:55 <nlv11757_> you wish it were raining :/
09:34:15 <nlv11757_> guess people always want what they are not having :D
09:34:18 <yoda-> hi
09:34:43 <TFK> "The grass is always greener in another climate"? ;-)
09:36:50 <nlv11757_> grass is very green here
09:36:55 <nlv11757_> but too wet for my taste
09:37:23 <Lemmih> Heya SyntaxNinja.
09:37:42 <jlouis> shapr: use speex instead than ogg
09:37:50 <jlouis> speex is designed for speech encoding
09:37:56 <SyntaxNinja> hi Lemmih
09:40:00 <shapr> jlouis: I'm encoding for a 1GB digital music player, unless speex is part of the base Ogg stuff, I doubt it'll support it.
09:40:20 <nlv11757_> hehehe
09:40:28 <nlv11757_> come onnnn a bit of firmware hackage :P
09:41:30 <nlv11757_> ow screw this my hunger is winning, im going through the rain
09:41:31 <nlv11757_> cu
09:46:27 <jlouis> shapr: it's not. Go for about 64k or maybe 32k bitrates
09:46:37 <shapr> ok, thanks
09:52:27 <shapr> I am convinced I will read this paper before I send email to SPJ et al asking them for permission to use the code.
09:55:55 <xerox> Which paper?
09:56:14 <autrijus> shapr: it is not for the faint of heart though :)
09:56:32 <autrijus> I read ccshan's "shift to control" (which is directly used in pugs) before that one
09:56:45 <autrijus> and still I found the need to chase many references
09:57:27 <SyntaxNinja> autrijus: OOI is Randell Schwartz at all involved in perl 6?
09:57:55 <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: he is quite interested in the development, and often chips in with some comments on p6l
09:58:06 <autrijus> and he keeps threatening to learn haskell
09:58:15 <autrijus> but he's not very involved in the day-to-day level
09:58:17 <SyntaxNinja> ooh. hmmm
09:58:24 <SyntaxNinja> I just realize he lives near me
09:58:31 <SyntaxNinja> I should email him and tell him I'll teach him Haskell ;)
09:58:36 <autrijus> yes! please do!
09:58:42 <autrijus> I pointed him to the online tutorials
09:58:45 <SyntaxNinja> do you think he'd be at all interested?
09:58:47 <shapr> autrijus: yeah, I'm barely hanging on...
09:58:56 <autrijus> but f2f is much better
09:59:07 <autrijus> SyntaxNinja: sure, I bet he would
09:59:18 <SyntaxNinja> OK will do.

10:04:40 <lambdabot>   Q: When does one know he has programmed too much Haskell? A: When he uses
10:04:40 <lambdabot> == and /= in everyday IRC chat or when he tries to fix a relationship by
10:04:40 <lambdabot> passing himself as a continuation
10:06:01 <yoda-> For those of you that care a new pope has been elected
10:06:10 <yoda-> http://news.bbc.co.uk
10:06:59 * shapr hangs onto his brain as the continuations discussion takes a sharp mental curve.
10:07:42 <shapr> hoi Itkovian
10:07:53 * shapr throws a continuation to Itkovian
10:08:05 <xerox> Now he knows what do to next!
10:08:08 * shapr grins
10:09:03 <vincenz> nerds
10:09:14 <shapr> vincenz: just like you ;-)
10:09:34 <vincenz> yip :/
10:09:43 <vincenz> except I'm not a haskellnerd yet
10:09:45 <vincenz> but I intend to
10:09:47 <shapr> C'mon, it's great to hang out with smart people who work hard to learn stuff.
10:09:49 <vincenz> once I find time and a suitable project
10:10:55 <shapr> You could hack on Pugs, it's way nifty.
10:11:05 <autrijus> right :)
10:11:08 <autrijus> we need more \folks!
10:11:20 <vincenz> pugs?
10:11:29 <autrijus> vincenz: pugscode.org -- way over at #perl6
10:11:37 * vincenz blinks
10:11:39 <vincenz> perl?
10:11:40 <vincenz> byebye
10:11:44 <Cale> It's a perl 6 implementation written in Haskell.
10:11:45 <autrijus> vincenz: real, honest-to-god compiler and interpreter
10:11:50 <shapr> It's quite cool.
10:11:56 * vincenz doesn't touch perl nor knows perl
10:11:58 <autrijus> vincenz: you don't have to know perl or even like perl :)
10:12:00 <Lemmih> Oejet: Yo.
10:12:18 <Oejet> Lemmih: Hej, Lemmih.
10:12:23 <autrijus> vincenz: but well... you can hack on darcs, I guess
10:12:32 <autrijus> if pugs is not your cup of tea
10:12:39 <Cale> I think of it as a trick to get perl people interested in Haskell :)
10:12:43 <vincenz> I'd like to start small
10:12:46 <vincenz> don't have much time to invest big
10:12:47 <shapr> vincenz: Right, see what I wrote - http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/620
10:13:04 <shapr> Cale: and Perl people think of it as a trick to...
10:13:18 <shapr> Personally, I think it's a trick to get everybody to try new stuff that they might like.
10:13:23 * Itkovian ducks too late and is pulled into the continuation
10:13:35 * autrijus delimits Itkovian and pushes a new prompt
10:13:52 <vincenz> what is Template Haskell?
10:14:11 <shapr> It's hygienic type-safe macros in Haskell.
10:14:16 <autrijus> vincenz: http://haskell.org/th/
10:14:38 <shapr> Personally, I want t-shirts with the Template Haskell logo on them.
10:14:47 <autrijus> "cut me open"?
10:15:27 <shapr> hm?
10:15:48 <autrijus> there's a scissor on that logo 
10:16:10 <shapr> Hadn't thought about it that way.
10:17:14 <sylvan> Has anyone got jhc up and running? I'd like some early benchmark results! :-)
10:17:45 <shapr> I like the idea of macros as automated cut'n'paste operations.
10:17:46 <Cale> ....... :)  (unicode)
10:17:48 <autrijus> jhc?
10:18:04 <shapr> JohnMeacham's new Haskell compiler.
10:18:23 <autrijus> 
10:18:31 <shapr> Was that utf8?
10:18:36 <Cale> yeah
10:18:45 <shapr> I must be missing some fonts
10:19:04 <Cale> U+2701 UPPER BLADE SCISSORS
10:19:16 <shapr> neat =)
10:19:30 <xerox> I see some swastikas O_o
10:20:00 <TFK> :-/
10:20:17 <TFK> Getting all neo-nazi?
10:20:40 <autrijus> they are peaceful buddhist symbols :-/
10:21:37 <xerox> autrijus, really?
10:21:40 <vincenz> depends on the (sexual) orientation
10:21:43 <vincenz> yes
10:21:58 <vincenz> the whole nazi thing stems from india
10:22:11 <sylvan> autrijus, yes... Hitler hijacked them
10:22:11 <sylvan> I meant that to xerox
10:22:18 <vincenz> I mean the word... what was it again, for being perfect
10:22:33 <vincenz> stems from ancient india
10:22:33 <xerox> What did it mean, before hijacking?
10:22:58 <sylvan> I think it's a sun symbol or something like that...
10:23:00 <sylvan> for luck
10:23:09 <sylvan> I'm sure google will sort it out for  you =)
10:23:39 <TFK> Maybe not google, but the Wiki will.
10:23:42 <autrijus> "svastika might thus be translated literally as "little thing associated with well-being", corresponding roughly to "lucky charm", or "thing that is auspicious""
10:23:47 <autrijus> (via wikipedia)
10:23:59 <autrijus> it's still widely used in buddhist asia in that sense.
10:24:01 <TFK> And also millions of dead people.
10:24:13 <vincenz> arian is also an ancient indian term, from before buddhism
10:24:13 <TFK> (But that's only in the boring part of the world...)
10:24:26 <jlouis> Category Theory: Is there any general consensus on the operator ! ?
10:24:34 <jlouis> (The exclamation point)
10:24:42 <vincenz> yes, a unique arrow
10:25:23 <sqrt> ! means unique, generally in math.
10:25:24 <jlouis> So !_{N \times N} is a unique arrow from N to N ?
10:26:04 <vincenz> !_{?
10:26:09 <jlouis> subscript
10:26:22 <jlouis> ! with NxN in subscript
10:27:35 <vincenz> oh
10:27:39 <vincenz> no idea
10:28:30 <gzl> jlouis: no, usually an arrow -> with a ! over it means unique arrow, simply a ! might mean something else
10:28:35 <gzl> maybe something like initial or terminal object (?)
10:29:31 <vincenz> it's a subscript
10:29:44 <gzl> the N x N is subscript, not the !
10:29:49 <Cale> jlouis: context?
10:29:50 <jlouis> gzl: is right
10:29:58 <jlouis> Cale N-structure in a Category
10:30:38 <gzl> also, N x N is a product, that wouldn't mean arrow from N to N
10:31:05 <jlouis> no, N-structure in a Cartesion closed Domain enriched category rather
10:31:16 <jlouis> Which is defined to be:
10:31:27 <jlouis> a) an object N in Ob(C) (where C is the category)
10:31:47 <jlouis> b) ZERO in D(1,N) where D is the domain
10:31:56 <jlouis> c) SUCC, PRED : N -> N
10:32:24 <jlouis> d) IFZ : N^3 -> N
10:33:28 <jlouis> Anyway, I'll stare at it a bit more and see if I can deduce this.
10:33:59 <gzl> i dunno anything about CCCs, maybe there's some special notation there.
10:35:53 <Cale> I've seen ! occasionally used for an evaluation map.
10:37:35 <TFK> How can I get a String out of an IO String?
10:37:42 <jlouis> TFK: you can't
10:37:48 <TFK> Well, actually, I need an integer out of an IO String.
10:37:59 <TFK> OK, IO Int, sorry :-)
10:38:03 <jlouis> TFK: you can't
10:38:09 <gzl> do { x <- stuff_producing_io_int; do_stuff_with_x_here }
10:38:14 <gzl> x is a Int there
10:38:36 <gzl> you have to do it inside that "box" though, you can't simply drop the IO (without cheating)
10:38:40 <TFK> Aha, and how can I produce an Int our of stuff I read in a file?
10:39:00 <jlouis> TFK: what gzl said
10:39:17 <TFK> I'm already in a do, I just can't quite figure out how to make an integer from my string.
10:39:24 <tuomov> I think I've seen ! used for initial or terminal object..
10:39:41 <TFK> do next <- (catch (readIO (readFile "hbin.cfg")) (\e -> return 0)) + 1 <--- does not work.
10:39:55 <TFK> Well, I didn't write it with readIO initially.
10:41:48 <TFK> I'm sure I did this before, I just can't remember how :-/
10:45:46 <jlouis> gzl, Cale, tuomov: terminal object makes sense for it. Thanks
10:46:27 <gzl> np
10:47:45 <Cale> catch (do { str <- readFile "foo"; n <- readIO str; return n }) (\e -> return 0)
10:47:56 <Cale> but you can't add 1 to that, it's an IO Integer
10:48:30 <Cale> you can, however liftM (+1) it.
10:49:27 <Cale> or you could simply increment by 1 beforehand
10:49:36 <Cale> catch (do { str <- readFile "foo"; n <- readIO str; return (n+1) }) (\e -> return 1)
10:51:01 <TFK> Yeah, I kinda got it to work, but I was hoping I could do the readFile and readIO on the same line.
10:51:21 <TFK> Although I suppose that nesting do's like that does make it one line ;-)
10:52:06 <Cale> well, you could use >>=
10:52:24 <TFK> No, I couldn't.
10:52:33 <TFK> Well, I could, I'd just never get it to compile ;-)
10:53:11 <Cale> n <- readIO =<< readFile "foo"
10:53:28 <jlouis> Cale: you are too fast. I almost had that line finished
10:53:31 <Cale> hehe
10:53:48 <jlouis> the do ... <- ... notation is actually just syntactic sugar for >>=, >> and return  TFK
10:54:11 * TFK sighs
10:54:18 <TFK> Thanks anyway :-)
10:54:30 <Cale> and if you're just going to return n after that, you can just omit the "n <-" and the "return n", that is do { n <- f; return n } == f
10:54:48 <Cale> so you could write it
10:55:06 <Cale> catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return 0)
10:55:19 <TFK> Well, I need to write next right back again.
10:57:05 <TFK> Ah, it compiles :-)
10:57:18 <vincenz> why catch?
10:57:41 <TFK> Because the file may not exist.
10:59:30 <gzl> @type readIO
10:59:35 <lambdabot> readIO :: forall a. (Read a) => String -> IO a
10:59:54 <Cale> writeFile "foo" =<< fmap (show . (+1)) (catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return 0)) -- :)
11:00:43 <vincenz> I figured as muchm but where does catch enter into the definition of IO?
11:00:46 <TFK> ^_^;;
11:01:10 <xerox> Cale, why fmap?
11:01:20 <Cale> fmap is the same as liftM
11:01:28 <vincenz> @type catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return o)
11:01:35 <lambdabot> bzzt
11:01:36 <Cale> @type fmap
11:01:38 <lambdabot> fmap :: forall (f :: * -> *) b a.
11:01:38 <lambdabot>         (Functor f) =>
11:01:38 <lambdabot>         (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
11:01:42 <vincenz> @plugs catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return o)
11:01:47 <lambdabot> Variable not in scope: `o'
11:01:51 <vincenz> @type catch
11:01:53 <lambdabot> catch :: forall a. IO a -> (IOError -> IO a) -> IO a
11:02:00 <Cale> that's a 0, not an o
11:02:01 <vincenz> @plugs catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return 0)
11:02:03 <lambdabot> No IO allowed
11:02:04 <vincenz> I know
11:03:37 <vincenz> @type catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return 0)
11:03:48 <lambdabot> catch (readIO =<< readFile "foo") (\e -> return 0) :: forall a.
11:03:48 <lambdabot>                                                       (Read a, Num a) =>
11:03:48 <lambdabot>                                                       IO a
11:03:48 <xerox> IO a ?
11:03:53 * xerox yows
11:04:13 <vincenz> ooh
11:04:40 <vincenz> so basically the IO a = IOError | data a
11:04:46 <vincenz> and the catch removes IOError
11:11:32 <TFK> Hmmm. borks.
11:11:38 <TFK> Compiles, but borks.
11:11:53 <TFK> ah, of course
11:14:07 <TFK> Hmmm, does writeFile bork if the file doesn't exist?
11:15:01 <shapr> yeah
11:15:05 <shapr> er wait
11:15:15 <TFK> :-P
11:16:27 <TFK> Tsk tsk, not in the annotation.
11:16:37 <vincenz> bork?
11:16:40 <TFK> Er, what am I saying, the error may be elsewhere. n/m
11:17:21 <shapr> Bork's etymology is from b0rk from br0k from br0ken
11:17:23 <TFK> yes, of course, it's elsewhere >_<
11:17:32 <TFK> ...from broken.
11:17:47 <TFK> ;-)
11:18:01 <shapr> verb, to bork; adjective, borken
11:18:13 <TFK> Heh, I'm not used to the "data first, path later" approach... hence the bugs :-P
11:19:18 <shapr> Man I love unicycling.
11:19:53 <shapr> First in-flight test of my music player says "does not mind being sweaty, but is unhappy about subzero temperatures".
11:20:35 <autrijus> shapr: fancy building / riding an eunicycle?
11:21:40 <shapr> Not really, Eunicycle isn't as much fun as the real thing.
11:22:14 <Cale> writeFile creates the file if it doesn't exist
11:22:20 <shapr> Today I was jumping up and down steps, I don't think that's possible with the Eunicycle.
11:22:50 * shapr thinks about it
11:23:15 <shapr> A modified eunicycle could be fun.
11:23:35 <shapr> If it were linear in its corrective force vs angle...
11:24:42 <shapr> The downside of a unicycle is that they're not very fast, since they don't have gears. A relatively stable motorized eunicycle where you could lean more to speed up would get around that.
11:24:55 <vincenz> eunicycle?
11:25:04 <vincenz> that a cross between a unicycle and a eunuch?
11:25:05 <shapr> @google eunicycle trevor
11:25:08 <lambdabot> http://tlb.org/eunicycle.html
11:25:40 <vincenz> oy
11:25:43 <shapr> vey
11:25:46 <vincenz> yip, I was right
11:26:03 * vincenz grins
11:28:22 <TFK> Anything funny about this one?
11:28:23 <TFK> savePost html = do next_file <- do {n <- getNextFile; n <- readIO n; return (n ++ ".html")}
11:28:23 <TFK>                    writeFile ("../htdocs/pastebin/"++next_file) (renderHtml html)
11:28:23 <TFK>                    return next_file
11:28:53 <TFK> Because it doesn't write anything. However, it does write the hbin.cfg file, which happens just two lines earlier.
11:29:01 <TFK> (This does compile, btw)
11:31:11 <TFK> (so it has permission, if it writes the first file; it's written in the same directory)
11:35:33 <TFK> Well, it works now.
11:35:36 <TFK> Beats me why...
11:37:33 <Cale> It's considered strange to shadow variables like that in a do-block
11:37:58 <Cale> (but it is okay to do so)
11:38:05 <TFK> What do you mean, shadow? Reassignment?
11:38:08 <Cale> yeah
11:38:17 <Philippa_> 'rebinding' rather than 'reassignment', but yeah
11:38:51 <TFK> Hmm, I'd think that since it's a pseudo-imperative thing, rebinding wouldn't be frown upon, but OK.
11:39:00 <Philippa_> nothing in memory gets changed (unless the compiler's sufficiently smart), it's just that the identifier refers to a different value
11:39:07 <Philippa_> it depends on what you're doing, basically
11:39:22 <Philippa_> that's not a particularly bad usage
11:39:47 <TFK> Hmm, shouldn't the old value get scrapped?
11:40:25 <Cale> It will probably eventually be garbage collected
11:40:25 <Philippa_> it will the next time the GC's run
11:40:32 <Philippa_> right
11:40:49 <Philippa_> it becomes garbage at that point and a sufficiently smart compiler can figure that out, but in practice I'd expect it to get left for the GC
11:41:00 <TFK> When is the GC going to be run?
11:41:10 <TFK> Erm, in general
11:41:41 <jlouis> TFK: when the area of memory it has allocated is exhausted in a basic stop-n-go allocator
11:41:48 <Igloo> Shadowing bindings is bad IMO as it means you can't use the compiler warnings to help you find bugs
11:42:05 <jlouis> More advanced garbage collectors can interleave garbage collection with memory allocation
11:42:08 <TFK> ok...
11:44:59 <TFK> Well, the pastebin is semi-functional.
11:45:23 <TFK> Now to plug in the syntax-colorizer...
11:46:19 <TFK> (Note that I reserve the right to delete everything until the pastebin goes officially online >-)
11:48:04 <TFK> Also of course to make it less of an eye-sore.
11:50:52 <Cale> you need a syntax colourer
11:51:08 <Cale> perhaps there's one you could use already
11:51:22 <Cale> there are certainly parsing tools which come with GHC
11:51:36 <TFK> shapr pointed out something already
11:51:44 <TFK> I have it bookmarked somewhere o_O
11:57:26 <nhc98> hi JaffaCake
11:58:14 <SyntaxNinja> hey nhc98
11:58:19 <TNKS> Hi everybody.  I sometimes forget the heirarchal relations of type classes.  Does someone know of a good web-page or document that draws out a nice graph of that?
11:58:22 <SyntaxNinja> JaffaCake seems to be rather idle
11:58:45 <nhc98> Has anyone managed to get the new jhc compiler to build yet?
11:59:51 <Cale> TNKS: you mean the classes that are in the standard?
12:00:02 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/basic.html
12:00:17 <Cale> Figure 5
12:01:18 <TNKS> Cale, thanks.
12:04:00 <shapr> hiya stepcut
12:04:34 <shapr> Wow, nhc98, JaffaCake, and JohnMeacham on at the same time. Where's Lennart Augustsson?
12:04:49 <nhc98> Does lennart join here sometimes?
12:05:14 <shapr> I don't think so.
12:05:31 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: JohnMeacham has probably gotten it to compile ;)
12:05:38 <TNKS> Cale, where's Ix in all of this?
12:05:45 <TNKS> Is that not "standard" in the Report?
12:06:12 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/ix.html
12:06:13 <nhc98> Yeah :-) I think he was asleep when I sent him an email earlier though.
12:06:19 <Cale> Just isn't in that diagram
12:06:29 <Cale> class Ord a => Ix a where ...
12:06:50 * SyntaxNinja thinks it's bad form to sleep
12:07:14 <Cale> SyntaxNinja: heh, how long have you been up?
12:08:05 <SyntaxNinja> Cale: hm. not very long really. about 4.5 hours
12:08:17 * SyntaxNinja has bad form
12:08:41 <TFK> TNKS, WinHugs also has a class hierarchy chart, if you're on win32
12:23:25 <shapr> Man, this subcontinuations paper is not going to be easy.
12:23:41 <stepcut> hehe
12:23:53 <TNKS_> hi all.  I forget the syntax for restricting multiple type variables to different classes (I know how to do the simple case of (Class a) =>...)
12:24:12 <qmole> heh
12:24:13 <shapr> (Class a,OtherClass b) =>
12:24:23 <TNKS_> shapr, thanks.
12:28:36 <shapr> poo, I don't even understand shift/reset. I think I'm going to have to dig through three or four layers of references.
12:29:58 <TFK> Pizza!
12:30:11 <shapr> Continuations are hard, let's order pizza.
12:30:27 <shapr> salut poetix
12:30:34 <poetix> ave
12:30:50 <shapr> Beware the IDEs in March!
12:30:56 <shapr> Actually, IDEs are dangerous in any month.
12:31:37 <poetix> Tackling monad transformers today. Or trying to.
12:31:54 <Cale> shapr: did you ever manage to get flash working to look at that subtext demo? I thought it was sort of a neat language.
12:32:08 <shapr> I looked at it long ago, and I was not impressed.
12:32:10 * TFK takes the break time of pizza eating to read up on monads
12:32:36 <shapr> I'm tempted to look at it again just so I can keep myself from saying something stupid on the ll1 mailing list.
12:32:40 <skew> It lookd slightly neat, but seems to be almost entirely subsumed by what Aardappel does
12:32:58 <skew> at least as far as graphical editing
12:33:04 <Cale> I've heard about Aardappel -- how is it?
12:33:05 <shapr> I remember thinking "How is this better than Self?"
12:33:37 <shapr> skew: ok, I give in. Send me the patches? What version of  ... of ... Java... does Aardappel require?
12:34:03 <skew> Cale: pretty cool, I like stuff about state
12:34:21 <skew> shapr: the patches are not actually required, the package comes with .class files
12:34:38 <shapr> I still wish Wouter would let us play with *all* his languages.
12:34:46 <shapr> I really want to try out some of the crazier things he's written.
12:34:52 <Cale> Wolfram Kahl's HOPS is neat.
12:35:00 <skew> that is, I made patches so you can rebuild it, but that doesn't fix the concurrent stufff
12:35:59 <poetix> I'd like a version of scheme's amb, but I think you need to stash failure continuations away in some higher-level binding and retrieve them later. So some sort of mix of the continuation monad and the state monad seems to be needed - but I can't figure out how to make that work...
12:36:15 <Cale> http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~kahl/HOPS/ -- not sure if he has the source up at the moment
12:37:18 <shapr> poetix: oh hey, have you read the subcontinuations paper? autrijus implemented part (all?) of it today, and I think it might allow continuation based web frameworks in Haskell.
12:37:53 <Cale> http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~kahl/HOPS/ANIM/index.html is cute :)
12:38:28 <shapr> That is quite nifty.
12:38:32 <shapr> Reminds me of Vital.
12:41:10 <shapr> HOPS output as SVG would be nifty.
12:43:00 <skew> shapr: subcontinuations are the shift/reset system?
12:43:47 <Cale> He apparently had good success debugging a tricky algorithm for placement of page footers in Lout using it.
12:44:06 <skew> Cale: what is this higher order graph rewriting?
12:44:31 <Cale> There was a disconnection which you could see between two parts of the code that shouldn't have happened :)
12:46:37 <shapr> skew: I don't know.
12:46:40 <Cale> skew: well, I don't feel too qualified to really discuss what's going on, but basically programs are executed by applying rules which rewrite code graphs.
12:46:48 <skew> the things with the apply nodes would be written by introducing an explicit "apply" node in Aardappel.
12:47:25 <poetix> Hmm. Advice from Haskell-Cafe on amb is "fergeddaboudit, use the list monad instead". But then there's Hinze on deriving backtracking monad transformers. And now this on subcontinuations...
12:47:52 <Cale> for example, the rule filter_++ depicted in the intro says  filter p (xs ++ ys) --> filter p xs ++ filter p ys
12:48:54 <skew> Aardappel is the same sort of idea, but tree to tree, and no type system
12:48:54 <Cale> @ is function application

12:49:07 <shapr> wargh
12:49:07 <Cale> argh :)
12:49:17 <shapr> I think it's time that became a privmsg
12:49:30 <skew> all the examples look tree to tree though, so I'll have to read this HOPS paper when I have more than a few minutes
12:49:51 <skew> the really neat thing about Aardappel is the approach to state and concurrency
12:50:11 <Cale> perhaps the second order bit is the type system
12:52:00 <skew> reduction within a tree is purely functional, but there are also these tree-spaces where trees can see each other, and their reduction rules can consume and produce other trees
12:52:13 <shapr> Oh that does sound cool.
12:52:22 <Cale> It uses basically the same system for evaluation as for typing
12:53:11 <skew> it's something like breaking the state up into little ST computations in Haskell, where that state is purely local and no ST computatiation containing or contatined by another can affect the state in that other computation
12:53:32 <skew> Unfortunately, this is the part that doesn't seem to work
12:54:03 <skew> That is, there are examples provided to demonstrate it, and this stuff is discussed in the thesis, but the evaluator doesn't like it
12:54:19 <shapr> Needs rewriting in Haskell? =)
12:54:29 <xerox> Any HaskellGoPeople in the mood for a game?
12:54:34 <skew> that's what I'm thinking
12:55:04 <skew> I thought the locking for the concurrent tree rewriting stuff would be pretty nasty in any language, but then I remembered we have STM, so I think I'll just let that sort it all out
12:55:10 <Cale> xerox: I'll play 9x9
12:55:19 <shapr> Yeah, I'm wondering about STM myself.
12:55:31 * xerox just lost with his sensei and needs revenge
12:55:39 <xerox> Cale, nice! I'm xerox on KGS too.
12:56:34 <Cale> you're ~7k?
12:56:51 <xerox> I am, more or less :)
13:00:48 <shapr> gwahr, iriver only plays oggs of a certain bitrate :-(
13:01:10 <skew> shapr: If I read the paper correctly, at least one STM transaction is guaranteed to make progress
13:01:25 <shapr> Yeah, I tihnk so.
13:01:48 <shapr> It'd have to.
13:02:25 * stepcut wonders what the ogg limitations on the jetaudio are
13:07:10 <bC> afternoon everyone
13:07:35 <TFK> 23:06 is quite the afternoon.
13:07:51 <bC> eh, its 4pm here
13:08:18 <bC> ridiculously hot outside for the first time in a while
13:08:20 <TFK> And it's 6 AM somewhere...
13:08:36 <vincenz> Hi
13:08:53 <TFK> Somewhere in the US?
13:09:03 <bC> east coast
13:09:23 <nhc98> 2110 here
13:09:25 <TFK> Ah, the other side of the world :-D
13:10:25 <shapr> 22:11 here
13:10:27 <bC> its only the smaller of the oceans :)
13:11:05 <lightstep> and it's not really half of the world, only a third
13:11:57 <TFK> Details, details...
13:12:17 <bC> i was having trouble with a problem, i was hoping someone could give me a little help
13:12:52 <shapr> What's the problem?
13:13:11 <bC> i have a tree defined as data Tree a = Nil | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a), and i want to apply a filter to the nodes
13:13:49 <lightstep> filter as in "take this, leave that" or as in "transform the values"?
13:14:23 <bC> the type of the function is fTree :: Ord a => (a->Bool)-> Tree a -> Tree a...i want to have a condition, and if that condition is not met, i want to remove that node
13:15:38 <lightstep> from your description, it seems that the function has a more general type
13:15:55 <lightstep> (without the qualification)
13:16:11 <bC> what do u mean?
13:16:26 <nhc98> Do you want to graft lower nodes of the tree in where the removed node was taken out?
13:16:36 <bC> no
13:16:38 <lightstep> why do you need order on the values?
13:16:45 <bC> just replace the removed nodes with Nil
13:16:51 <lightstep> can't it work on Tree Complex, for example?
13:17:11 <bC> tree complex?
13:17:23 <lightstep> tree with complex numbers in the nodes
13:17:37 <nhc98> filterTree p Nil = Nil
13:18:13 <nhc98> filterTree p (Node x left right) | p x = Nil
13:18:20 <bC> i guess
13:18:55 <nhc98> filterTree p (Node x left right) | otherwise = Node x (filterTree p left) (filterTree p right)
13:20:14 <lightstep> @wiki ThingsToAvoid
13:20:15 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ThingsToAvoid
13:20:19 <lightstep> `if' vs. guards
13:20:41 <nhc98> aw, guards are nice sometimes...
13:20:49 <shapr> I think ThingsToAvoid is the subject of an editwar.
13:21:11 <shapr> I like guards.
13:21:13 <nhc98> Oh, I think I got the sense of the predicate test inverted - not (p x)
13:21:24 <shapr> heippa hei esap
13:21:33 <esap> Hei shapr
13:21:55 <shapr> esap: Do you think you could publish the first part of your article in the next issue of TMR?
13:22:10 <bC> nhc98:  ?
13:22:40 <nhc98> bC: yeah?
13:22:43 <esap> shapr: when do you need it?
13:23:01 <shapr> JohnMeacham: want to write something about the interesting internals of jhc for The Monad.Reader?
13:23:29 <shapr> esap: Well, I'd like to have it in about a week, but I still haven't put up the author's wiki...
13:24:03 * shapr looks around for people to pick for Monad.Reader articles
13:24:28 <bC> that solution is missing or overlooking something, gimme a sec to see if i can see what it is
13:24:45 <esap> shapr: I'll try to do something finished next weekend. I think I can't do it during week, I'm already overcome by my work time schedules :-(
13:24:53 <sorje> "As a rule of thumb, once your expression becomes too long to easily be point-freed, it probably deserves a name anyway." Nice ;-)
13:25:20 <shapr> Ok. If you don't have time to get something ready to publish, I won't be upset.
13:25:56 <esap> shapr: Probably have to cut down the content to get things ready, because I don't want to publish things before they're ready for publication.
13:26:02 <shapr> Yeah, I agree.
13:26:37 <esap> shapr: But I do have some good material already, so maybe I can find a subset that will be good enough.
13:26:38 <shapr> You can put a cliffhanger in at the end "Tune in next episode when our hero faces his own dual!"
13:26:47 <vincenz> how does pointlessing work?
13:27:26 <esap> shapr: heh, something along those lines might be good for closing it.
13:27:31 <lightstep> @pointless (oh . my) . (how . amazing)
13:27:32 <lambdabot> oh . my . how . amazing
13:28:03 <shapr> esap: Yeah, a hero's nemesis is sort of his dual. Cheesy but cute :-)
13:28:03 <esap> @pointless (\x -> x x) (\y -> y y)
13:28:08 <lambdabot> s id id (s id id)
13:28:08 <lambdabot> optimization suspended, use @pl-resume to continue.
13:28:13 <lightstep> no notice?
13:28:35 <bC> nhs98:  say your given this tree: (Node 48 (Node 39 (Node 36 (Node 32 Nil Nil)(Node 38 Nil Nil))(Node 42 (Node 40 Nil Nil) (Node 45 Nil Nil)))(Node 60 (Node 50 Nil Nil)(Node 75 Nil Nil))), when you apply the filter even to it, it doesnt yield the correct tree...but def. a step closer
13:28:37 <esap> shapr: well I think it's not quite dual, might be adjoint though.
13:28:51 <shapr> skew: Want to write up a short description of Aardappel and how it compares to Haskell for TMR?
13:29:15 <lightstep> bC, you might want to separate the cases (using patterns and guards) and then figure out each
13:29:21 <shapr> nhc98: I assume that if you don't have time to work on threads, I shouldn't even ask about a TMR article.
13:29:40 <bC> lightstep, yeah, thats what i'm doing now
13:29:47 * boegel greets
13:29:49 <nhc98> shapr: that's about right, yeah.
13:29:50 <shapr> y0 boegel
13:29:59 <vegai> @pointless \smile -> this is so cool I forgot to smile
13:29:59 <lambdabot> this is so cool I forgot to
13:30:18 <esap> shapr: I got somewhat distracted to building the oolib (which starts to become useful...). That's why the article hasn't progressed much.
13:30:42 <nhc98> bC: For that tree I would expect the result to be (Node 48 Nil (Node 60 (Node 50 Nil Nil) Nil))
13:31:43 * esap is clearly trying to do too many things at the same time.
13:31:48 <bC> i would think the result to contain 60 50 48 42 40 38 36 32
13:31:50 * shapr is always trying to do that.
13:32:05 <shapr> The STM strategy doesn't work so well in real life.
13:32:34 <nhc98> bC: you said you didn't want to promote the lower nodes below the deleted ones...
13:32:38 <Oejet> shapr: Transactions?
13:32:47 <nhc98> But this looks like you do.
13:33:17 <shapr> Oejet: optimistic locking
13:33:24 <bC> nhc98:  i meant that i wanted to leave the ones below the deleted nodes intact, i didnt want the tree reordered
13:33:50 <nhc98> Ah, so the tree is ordered before we even begin.
13:33:52 <lightstep> shapr, you mean priority inversion?
13:34:01 <Oejet> shapr: Ok, anything I should read up on real world usage?
13:34:20 <nhc98> So why not flatten, select, and rebuild?
13:34:26 <lightstep> bC, you need some non-trivial merge function
13:34:40 <lightstep> bC, if you don't do as nhc98 just suggested
13:34:45 <shapr> I mean "Oh sure, I have enough time to do these other three things along with everything else I've said I'll do." doesn't work in real life. It's hard to abort a transaction when your fiancee expected you to spend time with her.
13:35:12 <bC> yeah, i dont think the solution is trivial at all :\  but it sure gets the mind working
13:35:44 <nhc98> filterTree p = mkOrderedTree . filter p . preOrderTraversal
13:36:01 <shapr> I mean STM doesn't work so well in dealing with stuff like scheduling your work and personal life :-)
13:36:25 <lightstep> which is probably why is only allows TVars and not IO
13:36:30 * shapr snickers
13:36:51 <Oejet> shapr: Have you let TVars into you life?
13:37:27 * lightstep now only has to understand IVars, MVars and `par`
13:38:29 <shapr> My fiancee keeps saying Hindely-Milner just isn't her type.
13:38:48 <Oejet> lightstep: MVars are mutable variables like IORefs.
13:38:51 <bC> nhs98:  i want to keep the (a->Bool)-> Tree a -> Tree a type of the filterTree
13:39:23 <nhc98> bC: but my solution does have that type...
13:39:45 <lightstep> Oejet, i vaguely recall something about signalling, a variable being a box that signals on the first (and only) time it's given a value
13:40:08 <bC> err...whats the type of your maketree and preorder?
13:40:50 <nhc98> OK, preorder :: Tree a -> [a]
13:41:04 <bC> yeah, same
13:41:11 <nhc98> mkTree :: Ord a => [a] -> Tree a
13:41:24 <bC> thats different
13:41:28 <nhc98> Presumably you already have a mkTree somewhere?
13:42:11 <bC> i have one, but its a -> Tree a -> Tree a
13:42:15 <Oejet> lightstep: Hmm, I am thinking about MVars as global boxes containing values for which access is syncronized.
13:42:29 <shapr> hey dcoutts, think you'll have a gtk2hs article for TMR ii ?
13:42:55 <nhc98> OK, so my list-wise mkTree can be built from your point-wise one by this:
13:43:33 <nhc98> mkTree xs = foldr addElement Nil xs
13:44:01 <shapr> xerox: Want to write a lambdabot plugin tutorial for TMR?
13:44:26 <shapr> kolmodin: something about Haste for TMR?
13:44:31 <xerox> shapr, I was playing with Cale
13:44:36 <xerox> shapr, TMP as in .. ?
13:44:36 <shapr> Ah, sorry to distract you.
13:44:48 <xerox> No problem, we finished :-)
13:45:04 <shapr> TMR as in The Monad.Reader
13:45:21 <xerox> It would be _really_ nice
13:45:38 <xerox> Oh, another game with Cale! brb!
13:45:42 * shapr grins
13:46:02 <shapr> CosmicRay: TMR article? MissingH and a call for libraries?
13:46:38 <lightstep> is there an array realloc function in ghc?
13:46:40 <shapr> tromp: connect4 article?
13:46:59 <bC> nhc98:  whats your maketree look like?  im also lacking an addelement function
13:47:05 <TFK> connect4 :D
13:47:39 <shapr> jlouis: didn't you mention something about an array kata at one point?
13:48:02 <shapr> gzl: short WASH demo for TMR?
13:48:49 <nhc98> bC: you said you had something like addElement :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
13:48:55 <gzl> shapr: ok
13:49:00 <shapr> w00
13:49:02 <gzl> in what form?
13:49:18 <shapr> What do you mean?
13:49:30 <gzl> i mean, does he want to see some code, or does he have some questions?
13:49:52 <shapr> I mean, do you want to write a short WASH demo/tutorial for The Monad.Reader.
13:50:02 <gzl> oh!
13:50:20 <gzl> I have some free time in May, but not before then. I could do it then, I suppose
13:50:34 <gzl> I read TMR as TFK
13:50:34 <shapr> Well, I'll ask you again for the next issue then.
13:50:42 <TFK> :-/
13:50:44 <bC> nhs: oh, that, completely left my mind
13:51:01 <gzl> shapr: cool. sorry, just need to finish exams first. :)
13:51:04 <shapr> no worries
13:51:35 <TFK> exams are overrated.
13:51:58 <sonden> what to do when the ghci version of a library contains unknown symbols that seem to be related to the base package?
13:52:26 <sond> compiling with ghc works fine..
13:52:34 <shapr> Check your package settings?
13:53:05 <sond> i've done that .the .cabal file for the package that i referenced as "library" above contains a dependency on base
13:53:19 <shapr> Unknown symbols usually means linking problems, usually means -package foo is missing
13:53:25 <sond> yep
13:54:02 <sond> but in this case the right package is there :) the package is HaXml compiled with ghc 6.4
13:54:10 <xerox> Back!
13:54:11 <sond> oh well..
13:54:46 <shapr> nhc98: any plans for a ghc6.4 release of HaXml?
13:55:01 <nhc98> Yup, once I can confirm it works
13:55:28 <nhc98> added a Setup.hs file today, after reviewing some of the archives of #haskell
13:55:38 <shapr> Wow, someone reads the logs.
13:55:50 <sond> nhc98, oh
13:55:52 <sond> :D
13:56:02 <sond> in cvs?
13:56:10 <nhc98> It's a vanity thing - finding out what you all have been saying about my software!
13:56:15 <bC> nhs98: thanks for the help, i think i may have missed something somewhere though, i'll keep working on it
13:56:15 * shapr laughs
14:00:15 <Igloo> nhc98: Oh, err, then we should tell you we use the "inspiring awe" meaning of "awful" around here  :-)
14:00:44 <Igloo> (nice to see you here, BTW!)
14:01:01 <nhc98> igloo :-) your secret is out - I know you hate everything I write!
14:02:26 <SyntaxNinja> yay nhc98 is using cabal!
14:02:48 <nhc98> igloo|: at least from a packaging point of view
14:03:01 <Igloo> OK, ~24 hours and that nick's already confused me
14:03:36 <SyntaxNinja> now suddenly there's twice as much work to do w/ getting cabal to work with all haskell implementations, thanks to JohnMeacham
14:03:50 <sond> haha :)
14:05:33 <nhc98> Since jhc is a whole-program compiler, I'm thinking packages might be more difficult to work with there
14:05:54 <Igloo> Just inefficient rather than difficult, no?
14:05:56 <nhc98> Or maybe less difficult, I suppose.
14:05:58 <SyntaxNinja> hm.
14:06:24 <Igloo> It just makes it hugs-like rather than [gn]hc-like from cabal's PoV
14:06:54 <nhc98> Yeah, that's about right, now you mention it.
14:07:39 * Igloo wonders if principal typings would allow it to be more efficient, and how hard it would be to get a Haskell superset with them
14:08:51 <nhc98> I thought H'98 had principal typings, though not principal types.
14:08:57 <vincenz> Hello shapr
14:09:00 <vincenz> You there?
14:10:59 <Igloo> AIUI it doesn't quite have principal types (given gamma and e return t) (although it claims it does), and I don't recall seeing anything about principal typings (where given e you produce gamma and t), but plain old H-M doesn't have them
14:11:09 <vincenz> anyone got a link the the http framework in haskell?
14:12:47 <sond> nhc98: great.. HaXml to builds fine with ghc 6.4 using Setup.hs
14:12:47 <nhc98> I think there was a paper by Joe Wells about this a couple of years back - can't remember the title.
14:13:13 <nhc98> sond: but does it work with ghci etc too?
14:13:18 <sond> yep
14:13:43 <vincenz> I want to get started with monads
14:13:50 <vincenz> anyone know a "simple" excercise to get into it?
14:14:14 <SyntaxNinja> vincenz: I think TFK was just working on that yesterda
14:14:22 <nhc98> sond:  Cool, I might release it in a week or two then.
14:14:29 <SyntaxNinja> if anyone writes some docs (poking TFK and Philippa_) please send them to me or the libraries mailing list.
14:14:41 <vincenz> I want to learn some haskell besides the standard functional stuff
14:14:48 <vincenz> so I need a good excercise to learn the power of haskell
14:14:51 <vincenz> especially monads
14:15:25 <lightstep> @google all about monads
14:15:28 <lambdabot> http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/
14:16:50 <SyntaxNinja> my first haskell program was a CGI script too :)
14:16:54 <SyntaxNinja> roughly
14:18:02 <vincenz> how would you start with that?
14:19:11 <TFK> SyntaxNinja, I was thinking about annotating some functions, actually.
14:19:26 <TFK> I gather I need to look at haddoc and write the annotations according to its rules?
14:19:37 <sylvan> TFK: yep
14:19:48 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: it's pretty straightforward. put a comment before the function like this:
14:19:49 <TFK> The other point is that they'll most certainly be completely rewritten after peer review :-P
14:20:00 <SyntaxNinja> -- |Explanation fo the function
14:20:00 <SyntaxNinja> theFunction :: ...
14:20:08 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: :)
14:20:19 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: now that you've learned, you should teach vincenz :)
14:20:44 <TFK> Sure :-)
14:21:00 <TFK> vincenz, well, I'm currently writing a Haskell pastebin.
14:21:27 <TFK> vincenz, I can go into more detail, if you're interested.
14:21:30 <vincenz> the problem with cgi, is that you have to know how cgi works
14:21:33 <vincenz> sure I'd love to hear
14:21:50 <TFK> Heh.
14:21:58 <lightstep> cgi is dead simple
14:22:08 <TFK> I don't know either, but yet, it's kinda simple.
14:22:48 <TFK> Basically, cgi scripts are server-independent programs. When the server gets a request, it sends it off to the CGI script, and then gets output from it, which it then sends to the user.
14:23:13 <shapr> vincenz: ?
14:23:29 <lightstep> and if directed from forms, all the fields go to env. vars
14:23:36 <vincenz> shapr: my friend here likes to design web frameworks
14:23:42 <vincenz> I'm hoping to start with haskell and get him involved
14:23:44 <vincenz> so I want a seed point
14:23:50 * vincenz nods at TFK 
14:23:53 <TFK> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/network/Network.CGI.html <--- the interesting function (for me) is the wrapper
14:23:56 <lightstep> omg, my program (again) worked once it type-checked
14:24:45 <TFK> You can see that it eats a function. This function eats [(String, String)], i.e. a mapping of env. variable name to its value.
14:24:46 <vincenz> what does one need to run haskell cgi?
14:24:54 * vincenz nods
14:25:01 <lightstep> but i think that's a myth: i got so many type errors that i had to think really hard about all the parts of the program
14:25:02 <shapr> vincenz: Designing web frameworks in Haskell is a bit different from most languages. Your friend might be especially interested.
14:25:09 <TFK> A server that supports CGI (Apache will do), and a haskell compiler.
14:25:27 <vincenz> shapr: I know I'm trying to get him hooked, but he's not a coder, it's hard to explain the power of haskell
14:25:32 <TFK> lightstep, I can easily bork a program that passes type-checking :-P
14:25:42 <lightstep> unsafeCoerce#
14:25:42 <shapr> How can your friend design web frameworks without being a coder?
14:25:49 <vincenz> TFK: could you perhaps write me a simple haskell cgi that pastes the environment variables
14:25:53 <vincenz> shapr: he mostly does php
14:25:58 <shapr> Oh
14:26:04 <TFK> vincenz, yup. Hold on.
14:26:08 <shapr> I think you should show him Parsec.
14:26:21 <lightstep> vincenz, main = wrapper (toHtml . show)
14:26:30 <lightstep> i think it'll work
14:26:30 <vincenz> lightstep: how would you run this?
14:26:31 <shapr> Parser combinators are the real stepping stone drug for Haskell.
14:26:38 * shapr tokes on a lambda
14:26:44 <shapr> The first one comes free, man.
14:26:53 <monochrom> How can one design a building as a plumber?  How can one design a software framework as a coder?
14:26:54 <lightstep> vincenz, compile this with Network.CGI, and put it in your cgi-bin directory
14:27:04 <vincenz> lightstep: I'm a total haskell newb
14:27:10 <TFK> heh, that *would* work...
14:27:13 <vincenz> you'll have to talk me through the steps for once
14:27:18 <TFK> Not pretty-printed, though.
14:27:34 <lightstep> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
14:27:35 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
14:27:42 <Oejet> monochrom: Well, the building would get perfect plumbing.
14:28:31 <monochrom> Heh heh heh, perhaps the whole building is plumbing.
14:28:37 <vincenz> how do i add the Network.CGI?
14:28:40 <lightstep> vincenz, it's there now
14:28:51 <shapr> hiya quagmire
14:28:56 <vincenz> ths
14:28:58 <TFK> Ah, heh
14:29:05 <vincenz> lightstep: toHtml not known
14:29:06 <shapr> quagmire: learning Haskell? looking for info?
14:29:32 <monochrom> Imagine the plumber's paradise: at every point on the wall you can tap for water, since the whole wall is plumbing.
14:29:53 <lightstep> err, i don't have there libraries (or a server) around. you probably need to also import Text.Html (on a separate line)
14:30:26 <lightstep> and ghc sample.hs -o sample.cgi
14:30:37 <vincenz> lightstep: if I add that I get an issue with IO Html vs Html
14:30:39 <vincenz> in the toHtml
14:30:39 <monochrom> Now imagine a similar thing: a coder's paradise of software framework.  At every point you can add arbitrary code.  It is a monster, a patchwork, a borg.
14:30:48 <TFK> vincenz, you shouldn't.
14:30:56 <TFK> I don't know why, but you shouldn't :-)
14:30:59 <vincenz> import Network.CGI
14:30:59 <vincenz> import Text.Html
14:31:00 <vincenz> main = wrapper (toHtml . show)
14:31:02 <TFK> (At least I didn't)
14:31:16 <SyntaxNinja> my suggestion that TFK teach vincenz certainly shouldn't stop others from piping in ;)
14:31:22 <shapr> The borg do kick serious butt though.
14:31:28 <lightstep> oh. there should be a `return .' in the beginning of that line
14:31:28 <vincenz> @type show
14:31:33 <lambdabot> show :: forall a. (Show a) => a -> String
14:31:47 <TFK> Hmph, returns.
14:31:59 <TFK> Well I dunno, lightstep is quite ahead of me ;-)
14:32:23 <vincenz> lightstep: where?
14:32:36 <TFK> I think I'll spam the Wiki with an example or somesuch.
14:32:36 <lightstep> wrapper (return . toHtml . show)
14:33:21 <vincenz> lightstep: I still need to link in NetworkCGI
14:33:29 <lightstep> `return' is the method that wraps a value in a monad
14:33:33 <vincenz> yip
14:33:34 <TFK> Netowkr.CGI
14:33:44 <vincenz> yes but "link" it
14:34:02 <TFK> ghc --make Main.hs should do everything.
14:34:07 <lightstep> ghc does it. manual linking isn't popular in the last ~30 years
14:34:08 * boegel yawns
14:34:26 * shapr throws a lambda at boegel to keep him awake.
14:35:21 * xerox hits shapr : <<you can't keep throwing lambdas here and there!>>
14:35:37 <stepcut> mmm, linking
14:35:42 <shapr> oof
14:35:45 <SyntaxNinja> poor kitty
14:36:12 <Itkovian_> boegel, yawning is contagious
14:36:49 <xerox> j/k
14:36:59 <TFK> "The source file for module Main{-pfe.hs-} is not available." :-/
14:37:11 <shapr> Is that for h2h?
14:37:35 <TFK> aha
14:37:55 <TFK> Hmph. Those two limitations are not good, btw.
14:38:42 <TFK> How hard would it be to implement a very simple syntax-colourer? Make keywords in one color, strings/chars in another, comments in yet another one...
14:39:14 <nhc98> for Haskell?
14:39:26 <TFK> Yeah.
14:39:28 <shapr> For Haskell, difficult. It's a lot easier to just use h2h or other existing critter.
14:39:46 <nhc98> See 'hscolour' on my homepage
14:39:54 <vincenz> alright it wokrs
14:40:00 <vincenz> now what?
14:40:08 <shapr> nhc98: Have you seen Thomas Hallgren's h2h?
14:40:18 <nhc98> nope, what is it?
14:40:27 <TFK> Well, these too assumptions kinda make h2h (the unhacked version) not so-useful.
14:40:35 <TFK> nhc98, aye, will take a look, thanks
14:40:45 <shapr> What are the h2h assumptions?
14:40:50 <shapr> Requires pfe?
14:40:55 <shapr> nhc98: http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~hallgren/Programatica/tools/pfe.cgi?UTF8
14:40:57 <vincenz> now how do I make nice html?
14:40:58 <TFK> nhc98, just... what is your page? :-)
14:41:09 <TFK> vincenz, oh boy, are you in for it :-)
14:41:25 <nhc98> http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~malcolm
14:41:32 <TFK> vincenz, Text.Html is where it's all at.
14:41:45 <shapr> h2h makes those sexy html markups of Haskell source.
14:42:17 <TFK> You can, however, use primHtml to make it eat your own html literals - otherwise it will eat your strings as text, converting <,> and all.
14:42:38 <nhc98> h2h looks nice.
14:43:00 <nhc98> hscolour does a much simpler html colouring, no hyperlinks.
14:43:41 <shapr> On the downside, h2h requires pfe and access to all the sources.
14:44:27 <vincenz> TFK: simple example...how do I make htlm entities of my text, but not with the entire body stuff...I want to add that later
14:44:38 <SyntaxNinja> nhc98: we still love your software
14:44:48 <TFK> vincenz, what do you mean by "entities"?
14:44:49 <vincenz> put the body around this (map (add an li) map (each item in the environment....to html))
14:45:14 <TFK> The body is added automatically, if needed.
14:45:22 <sond> hm.. i just got an internal error out of ghc.
14:45:32 <vincenz> TFK: by the wrapper?
14:45:51 <TFK> Very likely.
14:46:06 <TFK> It should call renderHtml somewhere there.
14:46:21 <vincenz> map stringToHtml on input?
14:46:34 <TFK> What's your input?
14:46:41 <TFK> Also, notice the toHtmlFromList function.
14:46:50 <vincenz> wait lemme try something
14:47:01 <vincenz> something like this
14:47:02 <vincenz> main = wrapper (return . toHtml . (map li) . (map show))
14:47:46 <TFK> What's li?
14:47:55 <vincenz> making it a listitem
14:48:56 <TFK> A listitem? Some Html object?
14:49:33 <TFK> I still think you need toHtmlFromList there.
14:49:44 <TFK> Doesn't it bork with a type complaint?
14:51:04 <vincenz> main = wrapper (return . toHtml . (map (li . bold .stringToHtml . show)))
14:51:12 <vincenz> anyway I can clean the the ()?
14:51:58 <TFK> Does that really work?
14:52:50 <TFK> Personally, I did: main = wrapper processCgi; processCgi envVars = do ...; <--- makes it more readable (for me), I get confused by lots of function compositions >_<
14:53:08 <lightstep> @pointless wrapper (return . toHtml . (map (li . bold .stringToHtml . show)))
14:53:10 <lambdabot> wrapper (return . toHtml . map (li . bold . stringToHtml . show))
14:55:29 <vincenz> TFK: could I see the code of the pastebin?
14:55:44 <TFK> is 'hmake' part of GNU's make utils?
14:56:03 <TFK> vincenz, I could paste it, of course, but it's *very* ugly.
14:56:09 <vincenz> that's ok
14:56:23 <TFK> I can already point to some cleanups I can do (but still didn't). There are a number of redundancies, etc.
14:57:11 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: in a .cabal file, how do I indicate that it should never install library files, just binaries?
14:57:21 <vincenz> anyone got any suggestions?
14:57:30 <vincenz> right now I just print the environment variables
14:57:39 --- topic: set to '' by quagmire
14:57:45 <vincenz> how do you look something up in an association list?
14:57:50 <vincenz> [(string, string)]
14:58:04 <wagle> @type lookup
14:58:04 <lightstep> @type lookup
14:58:09 <lambdabot> lookup :: forall b a. (Eq a) => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
14:58:09 <lambdabot> lookup :: forall b a. (Eq a) => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
14:58:14 <lightstep> sorry
14:58:17 <wagle> BEAT YA!  8-ppppppp
14:58:23 <TFK> vincenz,  http://tfk.is-a-geek.org/pastebin/10.html
14:59:01 <TFK> Ouch. Something's broken in it.
14:59:04 <vincenz> aren't strings and [char] the same?
14:59:15 <TFK> Ah, the <pre> tag.
14:59:19 <wagle> type String = [Char]
14:59:27 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: you're building the library but you don't want to install it?
14:59:36 <wagle> @info String
14:59:37 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
14:59:38 <vincenz>     Couldn't match `[([Char], b)]' against `(String, String)'
14:59:38 <vincenz>         Expected type: [(String, String)] -> IO Html
14:59:38 <vincenz>         Inferred type: [[([Char], b)]] -> m Html
15:00:00 <TFK> Meh, gotta ditch the <pre> tag for now, otherwise the browser will change fonts and the enumeration will be broken.
15:00:26 <wagle> [_] != [[_]]
15:00:33 <vincenz> oops
15:00:40 <vincenz> oh!
15:00:53 <vincenz> damn it's a Maybe
15:00:55 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: no, it's not a library at all.
15:01:00 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I want 5 binarise.
15:01:04 <vincenz> how do I work with a Maybe?
15:01:09 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I have no exposed-modules or anything like that
15:01:17 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: then it won't build or install a library
15:01:26 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: ./setup copy attempts to do so.
15:01:39 <SyntaxNinja> did you used to have a library?
15:01:44 <CosmicRay> no
15:02:12 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: cabal file at http://darcs.complete.org/darcs-buildpackage/darcs-buildpackage.cabal

15:03:20 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: that cabal file builds? what version of cabal?
15:03:25 <CosmicRay> that command was tree/darcs-buildpackage$ ./setup copy --copy-prefix=debian/darcs-buildpackage
15:03:34 <CosmicRay> ii  libghc6-cabal- 0.5-1          Haskell Common Architecture for Building App
15:03:43 <lightstep> vincenz, use `case' to differentiate Nothing from Just _
15:03:46 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: there's an error. ghc-options, and I think extensions don't belong in that first stanza
15:03:53 <TFK> Does anyone know where hmake comes from?
15:03:54 <vincenz> @type case
15:03:56 <lambdabot> bzzt
15:04:10 <CosmicRay> yeah I noticed that it had no effect  unless I put it in the executable area, but why would that make it try to built a lib?
15:04:12 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: the sanity checker complains if you have stuff like ghc-options but no exposed modules. maybe 0.5 didn't implement the sanity checker
15:04:15 <SyntaxNinja> 1.0 does, though.
15:04:22 <CosmicRay> ah
15:04:27 <CosmicRay> do you think you could build that for debian?
15:04:48 <vincenz> how do you work with a case?
15:04:51 <SyntaxNinja> yeah; I guess I was under the bad impression that 0.5 was basically the same as 0.6. maybe I forgot about that.
15:04:52 <vincenz> and sorry about the newb questiosn
15:04:54 * vincenz is trying to learn
15:04:58 <ski> vincenz : case someMaybeValue of Nothing -> ... ; Just value -> ...

15:10:16 <vincenz> thx

15:11:21 <lightstep> yes
15:11:30 <poetix> TFK: just looking at the HBin code
15:11:35 <vincenz> woo

15:11:43 <TFK> poetix, I am going to clean it!

15:12:12 <lambdabot> flip . (. flip id)

15:12:31 <wagle> rofl

15:12:37 <xerox> ihih!
15:12:51 <lightstep> wagle, this contains the assumption that it takes 3 params

15:18:31 <vincenz> sorry
15:18:33 <boegel> vincenz?
15:18:33 <vincenz> here we go
15:18:43 <ski> (theorb : fail is used for pattern-matching failure)
15:18:44 <wagle> i started observing the types of the self applications, then noticed that the types were the self (up to alpha subst) every two applications after the fourth
15:18:46 <vincenz> basically I look up the disco and then where this disco is and print the location
15:18:59 <xerox> OK, goodnight \folks!
15:19:01 <vincenz> but I would like it to print the name of the dj, possible the name of the disco and possibly the location
15:19:12 <ski> theorb : you can't, generally.
15:19:24 <boegel> vincenz: possibly ?
15:19:33 <vincenz> well it might not find it
15:20:02 <vincenz> basically I want to pass the result from the maybe and keep it in a list as well
15:20:21 <TFK> Un-Haskell question, but where do configure, make and install reside in gnuwin32? I got autoconf and automake, but apparently they're not it.
15:22:05 <vincenz> lookup 1 >>= lookup 2 >>= lookup 3....the result is used in a second lookup, the result in a third lookup, but meanwhile I also want these kept in a list

15:24:06 * boegel goes to bed
15:24:12 <TFK> wagle, I don't have cygwin :-/
15:24:19 <TFK> Not planning to get it, either.
15:24:24 <lightstep> or: {r1 <- lookup 1; r2 <- lookup 2 r1; r3 <- lookup 3 r2; return [r1, r2, r3]}
15:24:28 <wagle> you didnt have gnuwin32 either
15:24:36 <TFK> I have a few packages of theirs.
15:24:40 <TFK> gettext, for one.
15:24:42 <TFK> diffutils, too.
15:24:43 <ski> theorb : for some specific monads, such as exception, Maybe, List, mayhaps parser .. you can catch it (not always recover the String, though)
15:24:52 <vincenz> lightstep: that'll fail if not all are found
15:25:07 <ski> theorb : the point is to allow a monad to catch pattern-match failures in the monad
15:25:11 <theorb> Ah.  But not IO?
15:25:20 <lightstep> vincenz, when using >>=, when one fails, the others fail anyway
15:25:22 <wagle> TFK: thats all i know
15:25:33 <vincenz> lightstep: then I want to return a partial list
15:25:43 <wagle> mplus
15:25:47 <lightstep> theorb, you can't get out of the monad in the general case
15:25:54 <TFK> aye
15:25:56 <ski> theorb : so e.g. one can write do {Just x <- [Nothing,Just 1,Nothing,Just 2]; return x} in List monad and get [1,2] instead of match-failure

15:27:11 <wagle> grr
15:27:20 <ski> theorb : IIANM, fail in IO is defined to be error, which makes a run-time error, which though in some implementations are a kind of exception and can thus be caught (in IO-land)
15:27:28 <lightstep> vincenz, i think an `if' (or `case') chain would be the clearest in this case
15:27:40 <vincenz> yeah but it kinda ruins the power of monads
15:27:56 <lightstep> i don't think so
15:28:03 <lightstep> it just requires another monad
15:28:07 <vincenz> oh
15:28:23 <lightstep> i think writer is good for this kind of thing
15:28:38 <wagle> Monad> Nothing `mplus` Just 2 `mplus` Nothing
15:28:39 <wagle> Just 2
15:28:53 <vincenz> I know
15:28:58 <vincenz> but I need the Nothing to find the Just 
15:29:55 <vincenz> maybe this requires an extra monad
15:30:01 <vincenz> that keeps the last result and the list of resulsts
15:30:04 <wagle> Monad> Nothing >> Just 2 >> Nothing :: Maybe Integer
15:30:04 <wagle> Nothing
15:30:07 * SyntaxNinja has a few extra monads lying around
15:30:23 * lightstep has a crush on RWS lately
15:30:24 * SyntaxNinja had an infinite list of them here somewhere...
15:30:29 <wagle> SyntaxNinja has real monads
15:30:35 <SyntaxNinja> lightstep: dare I ask... what's RWS?
15:30:51 <lightstep> a reader-writer-state-monad
15:30:53 <ski> ReadWriteState ?
15:30:53 <SyntaxNinja> wagle: :)
15:30:59 <SyntaxNinja> ahh.
15:31:06 * monochrom has as many monads as there are real numbers.
15:31:10 <wagle> >> stops at the first Nothing..  mplus stops at the first Just
15:31:24 * vincenz nods
15:31:26 <wagle> vincenz: i think you want mplus
15:31:30 <vincenz> I guess
15:31:36 <vincenz> but I don't want to repeat the search
15:32:21 <monochrom> need a dynamic programming monad? :)
15:32:35 <vincenz> I have three lookup tables...
15:32:46 <vincenz> the result from the first is used in the second, result in the second used in the third
15:32:54 <vincenz> but I also want to build the list containing upto where I found
15:32:55 <lightstep> i even wrote a forth clone in RWS (instead of IO): http://lightstep.woobling.org/forth.tar.gz
15:33:35 <lightstep> vincenz, Writer allows you to log output at each stage of the computation
15:33:42 <vincenz> I'd like it cleaner
15:34:19 <vincenz> no writer
15:34:26 <vincenz> I want it to return a list with all the stuff I found
15:35:02 <monochrom> (construct the list by the writer!)
15:35:20 <lightstep> soyou probably want to create a list of maybes, and fill in the defaults with Maybe.maybe
15:35:30 * vincenz hmms
15:35:50 <vincenz> general case...I have a list of assoclist and a key
15:36:03 <vincenz> I return a list of found values, where each key is the last value
15:36:28 <vincenz> [[(A, A)]] -> A -> [A]
15:37:33 <vincenz> a foldl is good, but I also want to keep the intermediate values
15:38:04 <ski> scanl ?
15:38:39 <vincenz> @type foldl
15:38:41 <lambdabot> foldl :: forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
15:38:56 <ski> @type scanl
15:38:57 <lambdabot> scanl :: forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> [a]
15:39:07 <vincenz> what does scanl do?
15:39:18 <ski> keeps the intermediate values
15:39:30 <ski> (otherwise' as foldl)
15:39:41 <vincenz> oh!
15:40:06 <TFK> I can't compile hscolour without cygwin, can I?
15:40:16 <ski> maybe you could scanl over a list of your assocLists ? (not having completely understood what you want to do)
15:40:25 <vincenz> scanl won't work with Maybe's
15:40:52 <vincenz> it's (a -> b -> Maybe a)
15:41:02 <ski> maybe a scanlM is needed ..
15:41:30 <vincenz> don't know it
15:41:41 <ski> (hypothetical) scanlM :: Monad m => (a -> b -> m a) -> a -> [b] -> m [a]
15:41:46 <ski> me neither
15:41:50 <vincenz> don't want that
15:41:57 <ski> mhm
15:41:59 <vincenz> it'll break off
15:42:06 <TFK> Does anyone have hscolour binaries for win32, perchance?
15:42:06 <vincenz> I want to keep the intermediate values until where it fails
15:42:22 <ski> vincenz : hm, right
15:42:25 <vincenz> Monad m => (a -> b -> m a) -> a -> [b]  -> [a]
15:42:41 <ski> vincenz : that one's not possible
15:43:10 <vincenz> meh
15:43:12 <vincenz> shouldn't be too hard
15:43:14 <ski> hm
15:43:36 <ski> maybe using mplus would be best, anyway
15:43:43 * vincenz sighs
15:44:20 <ski> first trying to continue, and if that fails, stop with the list of what we have atm
16:22:21 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Did you mean "Haskell developers" at the end of the darcs-buildpackage ITP?
16:29:38 <TFK> Does anyone have at least hmake binaries for win32?
16:34:24 <SyntaxNinja> TFK: if not, you could maybe use cabal, depending on what you're doing
16:34:48 <TFK> Well, I need (to compile) hmake to compile hscolour.
16:35:23 <TFK> But it appears that I need cygwin to do that on win32, so I was wondering if anyone did it before me ;-)
16:36:15 <TFK> If not, it means that the syntax-colouring will have to wait until I get into Linux :-/
16:38:12 <vincenz> Oh well
16:38:18 <TFK> Lots to be done, regardless of the colouring, though.
16:38:24 <vincenz> monads are hard to use properly
16:38:42 <TFK> You got to monads already? ;-)
16:38:53 <vincenz> I know functional programming
16:38:59 * vincenz has intense ocaml background
16:38:59 <TFK> ah
16:39:04 * TFK doesn't
16:39:14 * TFK is scared of o'caml o.o;;
16:39:18 <vincenz> ocaml is easy
16:39:20 <vincenz> as pie
16:39:26 <TFK> pie in the sky?
16:39:27 <Pseudonym> Actually, I find monads very easy to use.
16:39:31 <vincenz> yeah
16:39:32 <Pseudonym> They're much easier to use than to understand.
16:39:36 <vincenz> but it won't do what I want
16:39:40 <vincenz> still getting used to them
16:39:45 <vincenz> and ont knowing the language/libs doesn't help
16:41:34 <TFK> Before Haskell, I took a look at O'Caml.
16:42:08 <TFK> "O'Caml for imperative programmers" looked promising but still scared me :-/
16:43:07 <TFK> Well anyway, I'm off to bed. Good night all.
16:45:57 <vincenz> How do you combine monads?
16:47:44 <ski> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MonadTransformers
16:49:13 <vincenz> thx
16:51:10 <vincenz> monads are pure category theory aren't they?
16:51:17 <shapr> yup
16:52:00 <shapr> vincenz: It all started here -  http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/publications.html
16:52:46 <shapr> And then Wadler noticed what Moggi was doing and grabbed it for Haskell - http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html
16:53:36 <vincenz> should I disentangel monad and typeclasses?
16:53:41 <shapr> Then a bunch of people worked on combining monads, with the existing monad transformers being the result. (More info on that if you want).
16:53:42 <vincenz> and see typeclasses as enablers for monads?
16:53:59 <vincenz> what I have
16:54:37 <shapr> Typeclasses and monads are entirely different critters. Monads have been implemented in scheme, ml, and perl.
16:54:37 <vincenz> (lookup k1 l1) >>= (\k2 -> lookup k2 l2) >>= (\k3 -> lookup k3 l3)
16:54:59 <vincenz> if I use a maybe, it returns me Just k4 only if it passes all the lookups
16:55:07 <shapr> Yup
16:55:10 <vincenz> if I made lookup return a different monad, it could save the intermediate values in a list
16:55:11 <ski> shapr : hiya
16:56:04 <shapr> vincenz: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/ProtoMaybe.hs
16:56:08 <shapr> ski: hej
16:57:50 <vincenz> shapr: it's a maybe char
16:57:58 <vincenz> I want to get the partial result too upto where it didn't get Nothings
16:58:50 <shapr> Ah, that's a different matter.
16:59:02 <shapr> When you string together Maybe types in a monad it means you want them all to succeed.
16:59:31 <ski> (if in monad Maybe)
16:59:40 <vincenz> one big issue
16:59:44 <vincenz> lookup returns Maybe
16:59:49 <vincenz> obviously I want a different monad
17:02:37 <shapr> I talk about a webstore that takes input of (order, customer) and does exists customer >>= instock item >>= chargeCost itemcost
17:02:53 <vincenz> yes
17:02:57 <vincenz> but you don't need intermediate values
17:02:58 <dons> jhc! yay.
17:02:59 <shapr> The customer must exist, the item must be in stock, the credit card must have enough credit.
17:03:02 <vincenz> you only want to charge ive everything passes
17:03:15 <Pseudonym> I think Wadler was the only person who understood what Moggi was doing.
17:03:37 * vincenz wants some sample applications to work on that are not too complex so I don't get lost but learn haskell
17:03:41 <vincenz> the gentle introduction is too slim
17:03:43 <shapr> vincenz: in your case you may want to use until
17:05:59 <shapr> something like until . not swing fold
17:06:13 <vincenz> well I ws thinking
17:06:17 <vincenz> if I step to a monad that looks like
17:06:32 <vincenz> data a MyMonad = SM [a] (Maybe a)
17:07:22 <vincenz> I could reuse fold
17:07:25 <vincenz> or the plain >>=
17:07:29 <vincenz> like you did in your example
17:07:55 <vincenz> I abstract away the fact it saves it in a list
17:07:59 <vincenz> and hence I can reuse the code
17:09:03 <shapr> I generally use pure code whenever possible.
17:09:07 <shapr> I think that's easier for reuse.
17:09:11 <stepcut> mmm, pure
17:09:34 <shapr> That's not always true, sometimes monads make reuse easier. But in cases like this, I'd go pure.
17:09:45 * vincenz hmms
17:10:20 <shapr> Monads for modularity usually happen when you want to mix pipelines. I don't see how you might want to do that here.
17:10:27 * vincenz nods
17:10:43 <vincenz> I wish I knew something small I could work on
17:10:47 <vincenz> to try out more monad stuff
17:10:59 <vincenz> and haskell syntax in general, though conceptually it should be close to ocaml
17:11:40 <shapr> I'd say go through the nomaware tutorial first, and then try something that mixes monads. Like using the HTTP.hs Browser monad to keep track of cookies, and still save files to disk via IO.
17:12:11 <shapr> A simple cookie-preserving wget that uses HTTP.hs would force you to mix monads.
17:12:15 <skew> writing interpreters is good for playing with monads
17:12:57 <vincenz> shapr: HTTP.hs?
17:13:28 <shapr> http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~d00bring/haskell-xml-rpc/http.html
17:14:23 <vincenz> with some luck I can do ICFP in haksell
17:14:27 <vincenz> do people typically use ghc?
17:14:35 <dcoutts> vincenz: yes
17:14:40 <vincenz> perfect :)
17:16:15 <Igloo> Of the Haskell people, yes, but I think functional languages are dominated by imperative ones
17:16:22 <dcoutts> vincenz: and darcs, and wxHaskell/Gtk2Hs etc etc :-) lots of Haskell goodness for ICFP
17:16:34 <vincenz> darcs is basically cvs?
17:16:43 <shapr> if linux is msdos
17:16:51 <Lunar^> shapr: good answer :)
17:16:52 * vincenz grins
17:17:13 <vincenz> what is different?
17:17:13 * shapr grins evilly
17:17:49 <apoplex> hi, can anyone help me to write a little program ?
17:18:10 <Pseudonym> Sure, how about "cat"?
17:18:16 <vincenz> how do I comment something?
17:18:19 <Pseudonym> "/bin/true" is quite little, too.
17:18:35 <Igloo> -- foo    or   {- foo -}
17:18:40 <vincenz> thx
17:18:51 <apoplex> i want to write haskell code for the java class GcdRepresentation from http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/krypto/algo/euklid.htm
17:18:57 <skew> I saw this nifty thing about making an elf executable in about 65 bytes, by overlapping the executable and both required headers...
17:19:12 <Pseudonym> Yeah, I saw that too.
17:19:28 <skew> That makes quite a little program
17:19:52 <Pseudonym> apoplex: Uh, we already have that.
17:19:55 <Pseudonym> Data.Ratio
17:20:51 <apoplex> Pseudonym: :( do you have the code ?
17:21:03 <Pseudonym> It's in the standard library.
17:21:19 <Arafangion> Hmm, no topic?
17:21:51 <Pseudonym> BTW, there's a fabulous presentation by Stepanov on GCD.  Has anyone else seen it?
17:21:53 <Pseudonym> www.stepanovpapers.com/gcd.pdf

18:38:53 <blackdog> shapr: around?
18:40:38 <Pseudonym> So, who's an expert on cabalising something?
18:40:52 <Pseudonym> Are there any tutorials?
18:46:37 <TNKS> hi everybody.  I've seen the '@' notation used for binding a variable to a list as in as@aHead:aTail = aList
18:47:07 <TNKS> but can you do the a similar binding as in coords@(x, y)?
18:47:44 <Lemmih> @plugs let p@(x,y) = (10,20) in (p,x)
18:47:50 <lambdabot> ((10,20),10)
18:48:17 <TNKS> Lemmih, thanks for the illustration.
18:48:21 <TNKS> I thought it made sense.
18:48:54 <skew> The synatx is actually name@pattern, to give a name to the entire value that you are taking apart with any sort of pattern
18:48:59 <KrispyKringle> Is there a debugger that'll let me see function calls, or the stack, or something?
18:49:17 <skew> so you can just v@(Just x) with a Maybe type, or l@(Left x) for Either, etc.
18:53:20 <KrispyKringle> Is it possible that the runtime would "fail: <<loop>>" incorrectly? When there is not, in fact, a loop?
18:53:28 <KrispyKringle> Perhaps it doesn't realize there's a base-case to the recursion?
18:54:00 <skew> KrispyKringle: no, it  only prints that when it actually has looped
18:54:03 <foo> Umn, why did the lambdabot message me?
18:54:22 <KrispyKringle> he must like you.
18:54:25 <KrispyKringle> skew: Dammit.
18:54:40 <KrispyKringle> So, any debugging tools? I don't want to be printing and converting everything to monads and such...
18:54:44 <KrispyKringle> :)
18:54:52 <skew> do you know about black holes and lazy evaluation?
18:55:00 <KrispyKringle> The latter. Not the former.
18:55:28 <skew> When GHC starts evaluating some thunk it puts a mark on it that says it's in the process of evaluating it
18:56:07 <skew> and if evaluating that thunk leads it in a loop around to deciding that it needs the value of the same thunk, then it notices the mark and prints fail: <<loop>>
18:56:20 <KrispyKringle> Ah.
18:56:26 <KrispyKringle> hrm.
18:56:52 <skew> I usually just test individual functions in the interpreter, but I'm usually writing pretty small programs too
18:58:07 <KrispyKringle> yeah, same
18:58:13 <KrispyKringle> but i wrote a test function with this and it worked
18:58:29 <KrispyKringle> i converted a largish function to use memoization with a lazily evaluated list. or so i thought.
18:58:39 <KrispyKringle> so i guess i can build it up piece-by-piece. i was just hoping to avoid that. ;)
18:58:58 <KrispyKringle> aha
18:59:01 <KrispyKringle> im making some headway.
18:59:48 <KrispyKringle> anyway, i guess rewriting it is my only hope. thanks ;)
19:06:02 * Lemmih laughs at "Cabal vs Haskell".
19:08:21 <vincenz> I see
19:08:31 <skew> Lemmih: where is that?
19:08:32 <vincenz> so the $ operator has higher precedence than function application?
19:09:30 <Lemmih> skew: libraries@
19:12:15 <skew> Lemmih: I haven't found that. Is it a message this month?
19:12:40 <Lemmih> skew: It was sent 1 hour ago.
19:16:08 <Lemmih> What happened to the topic?
19:28:42 <TNKS> what's the "not equals" operator in Haskell?
19:28:45 <TNKS> is it != or /=?
19:28:56 <Lemmih> @plugs 10 /= 20
19:28:58 <lambdabot> True
19:29:05 <TNKS> Lemmih, thanks again.
19:35:18 <dons> Lemmih, we were playing around with the @topic-* ops earlier and it got wiped :/
19:38:47 <blackdog> you're a champion, don. Thanks. (I hope to break hs-plugins many more times over the next few weeks. :)
19:38:56 <dons> please do :)
19:39:14 <dons> do you require hard type safety for this app?
19:39:25 <blackdog> It'd be preferred. Why?\
19:39:30 <dons> or, for example, would dynload work?
19:39:50 <dons> dynload, where the plugins symbols are wrapped as Dynamics, is much faster than pdynload
19:40:30 <dons> so if you trust the object .hs, but nonetheless want to check the types, then dynload will give you better performance, at the cost of restricting to monomorphic values
19:40:36 <blackdog> I'm not too concerned with speed. I figure that in production mode, i can require a manual reload of all plugins...
19:40:42 <dons> ok.
19:40:53 <blackdog> i don't want to restrict to monomorphic types, either.
19:41:00 <blackdog> i'm unreasonable like that. :)
19:41:09 <dons> sure. as long as speed isn't an issue, then pdynload is good
19:41:41 <blackdog> another possibility: i can just check the modification date and not reload if it hasn't been changed. (Or does hs-plugins do that already?)
19:41:51 <dons> does that already
19:41:58 <blackdog> (off to lunch, but i'll talk to you when i get back if you're still around)
19:42:00 <dons> oh, hm. not sure about _loading_
19:42:09 <dons> it certainly doesn't recompile it if it hasn't changed.
19:42:16 <dons> ok. ciao then.
19:42:38 <blackdog> basically, i figure the best way is to wait for performance problems to come up before i whinge about them.
19:42:55 <dons> the way to only reload if changed is to attempt to make the src
19:42:58 <dons> then check the return status.
19:43:23 <dons> it will be: MakeSuccess NotReq obj if it didn't change
19:43:29 <dons> so you don't need to reload
19:45:06 <TNKS> btw, I know IEEE supports infinity.  And you can generate it I think with a divide by zero calculation, but does Haskell have a cleaner way?
19:45:18 <TNKS> can you just type something like "infinity"?
19:46:18 <dons> @plugs 1.0 / 0.0
19:46:20 <lambdabot> Infinity
19:46:21 <dons> @type 1.0 / 0.0
19:46:23 <lambdabot> 1.0 / 0.0 :: forall a. (Fractional a) => a
19:46:43 <desrt> @type inf
19:46:45 <lambdabot> bzzt
19:46:48 <desrt> >:|
19:47:24 <dons> @plugs let infinity = 1.0 / 0.0 in infinity + 1
19:47:26 <lambdabot> Infinity
19:47:31 <dons> cute
19:47:42 <lispy> nice
19:48:27 <desrt> i imagine that it's Infinity is ieee754 inf
19:48:41 <desrt> *its
19:48:49 <TNKS> yeah, I don't know the specifics of IEEE.
19:49:07 <desrt> @plugs let infinity = 1.0/0.0 in infinity - infinity
19:49:09 <lambdabot> NaN
19:49:14 <desrt> definitely ieee754 infinity
19:49:24 <TNKS> that's funny.
19:49:59 <desrt> 754 defines some very precise and quite sane semantics about under/overflows
19:50:13 <desrt> since it underflows to 0, 1/0 is treated as a valid operation
19:50:17 <desrt> (with result infinity)
19:50:43 <desrt> and a bunch of other stuff is defined too, like n/inf = 0, inf/inf=nan, inf-inf=nan inf+n=inf, etc
19:51:20 <desrt> inf+inf = inf, -inf + -inf = -inf
19:54:45 <TNKS> cool.
19:55:24 <TNKS> I was under the impression about IEEE's specification, but I'm hesitant to write code to explicitly exploit it.
19:55:47 <TNKS> I mean, I think the standard even has positive and negative zero. . . so you can converge to it.
19:58:55 <desrt> ya
19:59:02 <desrt> negative zero is very useful
19:59:14 <desrt> say you have some very small negative number and you divide 1 by it
19:59:19 <desrt> you want that to go to -inf instead of inf
20:00:35 <blackdog> I Love Mens Asses !!!
20:01:01 <CosmicRay> well.
20:01:07 <CosmicRay> I've sure that will go unnoticed in the logs.
20:01:33 <blackdog> i am the fag meister...
20:01:57 <blackdog> please give it to me hard !!
20:02:03 <desrt> blackdog; so.. you doing anything tonight?
20:02:51 <blackdog> bring the lube...
20:03:14 <blackdog> scratch that - real men dont need lube !!!
20:04:05 <KrispyKringle> Let this be a reminder to all here to lock your computer screens when you walk away frmo the terminal!
20:04:06 <Arafangion> So... _this_ is what #haskell is *all* about?
20:05:32 <blackdog> i FUCK men! i fuckem!!!
20:05:57 <TNKS> can someone with authority please kick this guy off?
20:06:10 <blackdog> sook
20:06:17 <desrt> to random person pretending to be blackdog: please grow up
20:06:27 <blackdog> yes dad...
20:07:10 <blackdog> We are anything but random....
20:07:15 <TNKS> so does anybody know if the machine does inf calculation any faster than normal ones?
20:07:28 <KrispyKringle> hmm?
20:07:30 <KrispyKringle> what machine?
20:07:42 <desrt> TNKS; seriously doubt it.
20:07:46 <TNKS> well, I'm posing the question generally.
20:07:51 <TNKS> desrt, that's too bad.
20:07:55 <desrt> TNKS; the machine often does denormalised calculations much slower, though
20:08:11 <TNKS> denormalised?
20:08:21 <desrt> got a few minutes?
20:08:28 <Pseudonym> And demoralised calculations.
20:08:31 <Pseudonym> Very evil.
20:08:52 <machack666> any lambda wizards around?
20:09:00 <desrt> ieee 754 floating point has 2 types of numbers (excluding the special cases like 0, infinity, nan, etc)
20:09:05 <desrt> normalised and denormalised
20:09:23 <desrt> basically, the number is stored in scientific notation in binary form
20:09:29 <Pseudonym> machack666: What's a lambda wizard?
20:09:30 <Crewden> desrt: i remember them being called subnormals.
20:09:39 <KrispyKringle> haha
20:09:40 <desrt> 8 bits for the power, 23 bits for the 'mantissa' (ie: actual numbers)
20:09:47 <KrispyKringle> oh, i thought that was a joke :P
20:09:47 <machack666> someone good at haskell... :)
20:09:48 <KrispyKringle> sorry
20:09:57 <Pseudonym> No, not on #haskell.
20:10:06 <KrispyKringle> try #C++.
20:10:08 <KrispyKringle> ;)
20:10:09 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
20:10:19 <desrt> TNKS; the main idea is that when you write something in scientific notation, the first number you write is -never- a 0
20:10:20 <TNKS> desrt, I'm with you.  Sounds like the typical floating point bit-representation.
20:10:25 <TNKS> yeah.
20:10:27 <desrt> like, you'd never write 0.56 * 10^2
20:10:34 <desrt> you'd just write 5.6 * 10^1
20:10:34 <TNKS> it's normalized to where the first bit is one.
20:10:38 <desrt> yes.
20:10:43 <desrt> that's what a normalised number is
20:10:48 <machack666> what does an @ sign mean in the context of a type definition?
20:11:02 <desrt> then they realised that they could represent smaller numbers by taking advantage of a denormalised form
20:11:15 <TNKS> so you're saying that one can "denormalize" a number to get a number that's not typical, but still recognized?
20:11:25 <machack666> i.e. op2Map sub@(VCode _) list = op2Map list sub
20:11:27 <desrt> ie: if your exponent is equal to -128 or something, then it's a special sort of number
20:11:36 <Pseudonym> machack666: That's not a type definition.
20:11:41 <desrt> in which case the first digit is treated as 0
20:11:43 <machack666> ah, missing the '::'
20:11:45 <TNKS> desrt, crazy, I didn't realize this.
20:11:59 <Pseudonym> But since you asked, it's an "at pattern".
20:12:01 <desrt> so you can write numbers like 0.0000101001010 * 2^-128
20:12:11 <machack666> what does it mean?
20:12:11 <desrt> and they're called denormalised (or subnormal)
20:12:15 <TNKS> cool.
20:12:18 <TNKS> desrt, thanks.
20:12:19 <Pseudonym> @plugs let xs@(x:_) = [1,2,3] in (xs,x)
20:12:21 <lambdabot> ([1,2,3],1)
20:12:24 <desrt> a lot of processors can't deal with them as rapidly
20:12:26 <Pseudonym> Does that help?
20:12:34 <desrt> and some can't deal with them at all and invoke a software handler (*very* slow)
20:12:41 <TNKS> desrt, but you know know about performance for infinity?
20:12:46 <desrt> TNKS; same as normal
20:12:48 <machack666> let me think on this for a while...
20:12:57 <TNKS> desrt, oh well.
20:13:01 <Pseudonym> Here's another possibility:
20:13:08 <Pseudonym> @plugs let (_:xs@(x:_)) = [1,2,3] in (xs,x)
20:13:10 <lambdabot> ([2,3],2)
20:13:43 <Pseudonym> @plugs let wholepat@(_,subpat@(a,b)) = (1,(2,3)) in (wholepat,subpat,a,b)
20:13:45 <lambdabot> ((1,(2,3)),(2,3),2,3)
20:13:54 <KrispyKringle> desrt: i thought denormalized numbers only occur within the floating-point alu to get the exponents equal between two arguments?
20:14:00 <Pseudonym> The at pattern basically matches the whole of what comes after the at.
20:14:07 <desrt> KrispyKringle; nope.
20:14:18 <desrt> KrispyKringle; the specification defines the format that denormalised numbers take to be stored in memory
20:14:35 <KrispyKringle> oh. just for representing smaller values?
20:14:39 <desrt> yes
20:14:43 <KrispyKringle> hmm
20:14:46 <KrispyKringle> interesting
20:14:53 <desrt> you have all those extra bits... may as well use them
20:14:58 <Pseudonym> machack666: Here's an example of where you might use it.
20:15:09 <Pseudonym> merge [] ys = ys
20:15:16 <Pseudonym> merge xs [] = xs
20:15:28 <Pseudonym> merge (x:xs) (y:ys) | x < y = x : merge xs (y:ya)
20:15:35 <Pseudonym> You know what that means?
20:15:38 <Pseudonym> merge (x:xs) (y:ys) | x < y = x : merge xs (y:ys)
20:15:46 <desrt> ieee754 is actually pretty hot
20:15:56 <Pseudonym> desrt: It's also very subtle.
20:16:02 <desrt> it defines a crazy sort of math that often produces a wrong answer
20:16:15 <desrt> but at least it will deterministically produce the same wrong answer regardless of what machine you run it on
20:16:46 <machack666> so we're keeping the smaller of the two values in two particular lists?
20:17:14 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:17:31 <Pseudonym> However, you will note that you match (y:ys), only to rebuild (y:ys) later.
20:17:40 <Pseudonym> Instead of doing this, you can use an at pattern:
20:17:49 <Pseudonym> merge (x:xs) ys'@(y:ys) | x < y = x : merge xs ys'
20:17:50 <machack666> does it only ever compare to the first y?
20:17:59 <Pseudonym> I left out the other cases.
20:18:03 <desrt> Pseudonym; your mergesort is flawed
20:18:04 <Pseudonym> Like when x > y
20:18:14 <machack666> ok
20:18:40 <desrt> s/sort//
20:18:53 <Pseudonym> desrt: Very possibly.
20:18:57 <machack666> so is it sort of a macro on the preparsed text?
20:18:58 <desrt> incomplete case coverage
20:19:05 * Pseudonym nods
20:19:17 <Pseudonym>                    | otherwise = leftAsAnExercise
20:19:22 <desrt> :)
20:19:27 <Pseudonym> Proof by delegation.  QED.
20:19:41 <machack666> was that nod in my direction, or desrt's?
20:19:44 <machack666> :)
20:20:21 <Pseudonym> In desrt's.
20:20:26 <Pseudonym> It's not a macro.
20:20:42 <Pseudonym> It's to do with the way that pattern matching is done.
20:21:02 <Pseudonym> Pattern matching checks that what you're matching conforms to a certain shape, and binds some variables.
20:23:45 <machack666> is it shorthand then for a temporary variable whose scope is only the currnt line?
20:23:53 <Pseudonym> Yes.
20:23:59 <Pseudonym> Much like with the rest of pattern matching.
20:24:08 <Pseudonym> (Though it's not "the current line".)
20:24:10 * machack666 needs to read up on pattern matching
20:24:15 <Pseudonym> Yes, you probably do. :-)
20:24:58 <machack666> i understand the functionality aspects of haskell, but i'm still quite a newbie
20:25:22 <CosmicRay> @yaht
20:25:23 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: fact part
20:25:35 <CosmicRay> machack666: very best online tutorial: http://www.isi.edu/%7Ehdaume/htut/
20:25:43 <CosmicRay> machack666: though there are some books that are quite better.
20:26:03 <machack666> i liked the two dozen short lessons text
20:26:25 <CosmicRay> I'm not fmailiar with that one... url?
20:26:32 <machack666> hold on...
20:27:22 <machack666> (it's a pdf): http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~kahl/FP/Haskell/twoDznQ.pdf
20:27:44 <machack666> my only exposure to functional programming had been elisp.
20:28:08 <CosmicRay> ah.
20:28:11 <machack666> but my degree is in mathematics, so haskell is something that really interests me
20:28:12 <CosmicRay> haskell is a lot nicer.
20:28:25 <TNKS> hey everybody, I have specified (Integral a, Fractional b) =>, but what's the syntax to also put a and b in other classes?
20:28:44 <Pseudonym> Haskell is nicer than mathematics.
20:28:49 <machack666> the type system is definitely very cool
20:28:54 <CosmicRay> TNKS: (Show a, Integral a) => a -> foo...
20:28:58 <CosmicRay> machack666: indeed
20:29:06 <machack666> it blows other polymorhpisms out of the water
20:29:11 <TNKS> CosmicRay, got it, you just rewrite a.
20:29:18 <TNKS> I was looking for something more compact.
20:29:31 <CosmicRay> TNKS: I don't think there is anything more compact.
20:30:00 <TNKS> CosmicRay, no problem. it's not that bad.
20:31:55 <desrt> TNKS; 'a' is a single letter :P
20:32:27 <desrt> although, admittedly (Show Integeral a) would be nice
20:41:46 <machack666> thanks for the tips and pointers...i'll read up on that tutorial
21:11:41 <blackdog> man, I hate my workmates.
21:46:27 <blackdog> anyone around? it's unusually quiet...
21:48:21 <JohnMeacham> Finally. I was tracking down a bug in jhc, which turned out to be a bug in DrIFT which turned out to be a bug in ghc :)
21:48:58 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: hey, just read your jhc announcement.  it looks great.
21:49:10 <Gahhh> adobe acroread 7.0 is a 20Mb download on win XP. teehee.
21:49:46 <JohnMeacham> Cool, thanks.
21:50:27 <CosmicRay> the two most annoying things about ghc are how difficult it is to port an dhow large the executables it generates are
21:50:45 <CosmicRay> if you are spitting out pure portable C, then I suspect it should also be possible to make .so's with jhc, which would also be nice
21:51:00 <JohnMeacham> I am sure jhc will have other anoying things :)
21:52:12 <Gahhh> what is jhc ?
21:53:18 <CosmicRay> oh and you use darcs.  even better :-)
21:53:41 <JohnMeacham> But a goal was to be able to spit out properly autoconf'ed C packages. I am playing with .NET output, (well, mono, I don't have a windows box). It is interesting since jhc doesn't need a GC but .NET provides one. Perhaps I can have it optionally use a garbage collector if one already exists.
21:55:39 <JohnMeacham> Well, .so's will be tricky because jhc can't even produce standalone .o's. Of course, if the interface is specifyable in terms of FFI primitives, then it should be quite easy. but passing higher order functions over a .so barrier will be a substantial change.
21:56:28 <JohnMeacham> jhc is a haskell compiler I wrote. http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc
22:00:16 <Gahhh> JohnMeacham: holy cow !
22:02:35 <JohnMeacham> However, the lack of a runtime solves a lot of problems with so's. no worry about getting multiple GCs to play nice together or complex data structures to initialize.
22:04:26 <CosmicRay> heh
22:04:59 <CosmicRay> hmm.
22:05:05 <CosmicRay> I should have checked out your home page long ago.
22:05:08 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: Looks excellent, but why no GC?
22:07:20 <JohnMeacham> A couple reasons. I find region inference to be more elegant. jhc's goals involve exploring new territory and AFAIK region inference has never been applied to a lazy language and I'd like to show it is possible. With its small binary size and ultraportability an obvious market for jhc is real-time embedded systems, where the static guarentees of region inference might be more important.
22:08:23 <CosmicRay> ultraportability also give you an obvious market for AIX administrators :-)
22:08:26 <JohnMeacham> Also, GHC has a wonderful GC. So research-wise, there are already a lot of people working on it.
22:08:30 <CosmicRay> (2 days to build ghc for aix)
22:08:49 <JohnMeacham> wow.
22:08:51 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: hey, you could use arch2darcs on ginsu
22:08:54 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: What about the C++ style of constructor/destructor logic? (Yes, I know I'm just a newb in this... but it's education if I ask :))
22:09:03 <CosmicRay> it takes a lot of work to build anything for aix.
22:09:23 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, I have been meaning too. but cabal won't work on my quasi 64 bit system and I have not taken the time to figure out why.
22:09:49 <CosmicRay> well you can just use ghc --make with the appropriate -f's too
22:09:54 <CosmicRay> it's a pretty simple package
22:10:21 <JohnMeacham> constructor/destructor logic is actually very similar to region inference in ways, except that the compiler automatically inserts the appropriate collection points.
22:11:04 <CosmicRay> your GetOptions darcs repository has a binary in it (named try)
22:11:11 <JohnMeacham> yeah. I should have said I have taken no time :). ginsu still being in arch has bugged me for a while.
22:11:24 <JohnMeacham> oops.
22:11:40 <CosmicRay> :-)
22:12:04 <CosmicRay> hey, if I converted it for you, would you take a tarball of the converted darcs repo?
22:12:41 <JohnMeacham> Sure. Although, I should say I tried other conversion tools and they messed up on some log entries with characters they didn't like in them.
22:12:52 <CosmicRay> well then.  it will be a good test.
22:13:08 <JohnMeacham> Did you write arch2darcs?
22:13:26 <CosmicRay> yes
22:13:35 <CosmicRay> the only other tool I found was tla2darcs, which sucked for a whole host of reasons
22:13:42 <heatsink> What is a 'functional dependency'?
22:14:11 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: The one thing I dislike about traditional GC's is the lack of a destructor.
22:14:29 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: I am ignorant of the disadvantages of constructor/destructor logic, though.
22:15:43 <JohnMeacham> Oh, I thought you just meant the stack based approach used by locals on the C++ stack. region inference would not have destructors either. However, in haskell, you don't really need them because the 'withFoo' style is more precise usually.
22:17:05 <JohnMeacham> They are called fundeps sometimes. For multi-parameter type classes they specify relations between the parameters which must hold. these relations make it possible for the type checker to accept programs it otherwise wouldn't be able to.
22:17:25 <Gahhh> JohnMeacham: Do you mean mean space efficient by "efficient" on the jhc page ?
22:17:53 <JohnMeacham> I mean speed and space.
22:17:59 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: would conversions of hsregex and seven be useful as well?
22:18:33 <JohnMeacham> Not yet. I have not thought about those in a while.
22:18:37 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: I'm still in the C/Java/C++/C#/Python world.
22:18:57 <danb> why isn't there an identity functor?
22:19:16 <Gahhh> JohnMeacham: Isn't a C producing backend limit the speed efficiency (w.r.t ghc) ?
22:19:25 <CosmicRay> shall I just mail this tgz to you?
22:20:08 <CosmicRay> (400K)
22:20:09 <danb> and how does a functor differ from a type function?
22:20:31 <heatsink> Gahhh: what do you mean? ghc also uses C as a backend.
22:20:32 <danb> i think i want a type function, and i'm trying to use a functor...
22:20:54 <JohnMeacham> Yes. But that is because GHC requires intimate knowledge of its own stack in order to do GC and very fast indirect calls due to higher order functions while keeping tail-calls. it is a tricky combo to get out of C. jhc needs none of these because it transforms the program into a first-order monadic form before generating the C code and doesn't have a GC.
22:21:43 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, and C is not ideal for GHC. which is part of the reason the cminusminus project was started. I can also use features of cminusminus once it gets going, but it is less vital for performance compared to ghc.
22:22:12 <Arafangion> What's c--?
22:22:23 <Gahhh> heatsink: I was under the impression that GHC 6.4 was going to use cminusminus, sorry.
22:22:46 <heatsink> Gahhh: It might be in the works, I dunno.
22:22:55 <JohnMeacham> A 'portable assembly languge'. GHC does use cminusminus internally, but still generates C because a suitable c-- compiler has not emerged yet.
22:23:27 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: ginsu in darcs e-mailed.  it seemed to convert just fine.
22:23:49 <JohnMeacham> This is with optimization. without optimization and on x86, ghc acts like its own c-- compiler and generates assembly directly.
22:24:03 <JohnMeacham> cool. thanks. I will update the page later tonight.
22:24:30 <CosmicRay> no prob
22:24:52 <CosmicRay> since I tried out darcs for the second time last week, I've been converting everything I possibly can :-)
22:26:12 <JohnMeacham> Yeah. it is really great. It was strange. I was looking for something new, and didn't quite "get" darcs. so used arch. after a month of using arch I suddenly realized... hey.. all these things i want to do. darcs can do. that is why its cool. I wish I stuck with it. :)
22:26:43 <CosmicRay> not only that, but darcs can do them without requiring you to type in a paragraph of commands
22:26:48 <blackdog> the worst bit is having to go back to cvs after getting used to darcs
22:26:55 <JohnMeacham> indeed. so much nicer.
22:27:07 <CosmicRay> blackdog: tailor can do a bi-directional gateway.  The PHB need never know that you have something better.
22:27:30 <CosmicRay> blackdog: though of course you lose some advantages that way.
22:27:52 <JohnMeacham> My only complaint is no support for subrepositories. as you can see from my (divided) jhc repo. Someday I will write support for them if no one else beats me to it.
22:28:00 <blackdog> thank god, my boss isn't a programmer - he neither knows nor cares whether I use cvs, darcs, or a secret cache of vellum buried in my backyard.
22:28:04 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: yes, I've been playing around with that a bit.
22:28:08 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: there is a trick.
22:28:29 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: Subrepositories?
22:28:39 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: if you create the subrepository code in its own directory from the very start, you can then pull it into whatever main projects you like, and darcs mv its directory as appropriate
22:28:55 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: future darcs pulls from the subrepo into your project will follow that darcs mv and go into the proper directory
22:29:13 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: but this *only* works if you put all the code in the subrepo in its own special directory to start with
22:29:37 <CosmicRay> you can see this at work in darcs-buildpackage, which uses my sgml-common subrepo -- both at http://darcs.complete.org
22:29:43 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, I know that trick. but it is somewhat complicated to request of my users who I want to encourage submissions from.
22:30:10 <CosmicRay> they don't even have to know you use a subrepo
22:30:27 <JohnMeacham> But they have to avoid any patches which cross the subrepo boundry.
22:30:28 <Arafangion> What is a subrepo?
22:30:31 <CosmicRay> I guess I'm not certain if you could pull hacks on the subrepo component of the master project back into the subrepo itslef, hmm hmm....
22:30:40 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: ahh, ther eis that, yes.
22:30:58 <CosmicRay> Arafangion: a checkout from a VC system that combines two different modules in a single directory tree
22:31:08 <JohnMeacham> A subrepo is nothing yet :) I am hoping it becomes a standard part of darcs one day.
22:31:17 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: I think the wiki had a script that uses a hook to make what you're doing now a little easier
22:31:17 <Pseudonym> JohnMeacham: What abstract machine did you base your compiler on?
22:31:22 <Pseudonym> What's the underlying execution model?
22:31:24 <Pseudonym> Is it STG?
22:31:26 <Arafangion> JohnMeacham: That somehow reminds me of SVK
22:31:29 <JohnMeacham> No.
22:31:48 <JohnMeacham> It is the same model used in Urban Boquists thesis.
22:32:02 <Pseudonym> Oh, haven't seen that one.
22:32:37 <Pseudonym> There's another recent one that I was planning to try on a toy language.
22:32:40 <JohnMeacham> This is the best short overview http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~boquist/ifl96-abstract.html  and of course I sell printed copies of his thesis in the haskell bookstore. (my plot to encourage sales is revealed!)
22:32:45 <Pseudonym> I think it was from Martin Sulzmann.
22:32:48 <Pseudonym> But I can't recall.
22:33:14 <Arafangion> Is there a UseNet group I can read if I'm interested in developing my own toy language?
22:33:25 <Pseudonym> comp.compilers?
22:33:27 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: heh I am suddenly realizing that about a dozen different haskell-related things I've browsed in the past week point to you :-)
22:33:30 <JohnMeacham> There was a new one used in Helium that had some nice properties.
22:33:33 <CosmicRay> JohnMeacham: are you behind the t-shirts too?
22:33:33 <blackdog> comp.lang.functional might be helpful, too.
22:33:48 <Gahhh> Arafangion: there is a thread for beginners at lambda-the-ultimate.org
22:33:57 <JohnMeacham> no. just the books. which I really need to pay some time too. I have book requests piling up.
22:34:02 <Arafangion> Gahhh: Thanks.
22:44:00 <heatsink> interesting, grin is not referentially transparent.
22:45:09 <JohnMeacham> Only in the same sense that IO isn't. there is an implicit monad.
22:45:39 <heatsink> hmm, ok.
22:47:40 <aheller> anyone build ghc out of pkgsrc on netbsd 2.0?
22:52:24 <JohnMeacham> I am off to see a man about a pint of beer.
23:15:41 <Gahhh> does anyone use NoMachine NX for X11 or VNC ?
