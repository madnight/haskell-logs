00:01:49 <skew> I just found a factorial program that claims to be based of a recurrence (10*n+k)! = 9!^n * 10^n * n!^10 + k!, and opens with the comment "death to C and those who wield it!"
00:02:33 <skew> I'm wondering if I wrote it myself
00:12:04 <blackdog> dons: are you there? I'm having more hs-plugins problems.
00:12:23 <skew> blackdog: I think this is the dead of night
00:12:47 <blackdog> skew: nope, he's an australian too - here it's 18:13
00:12:52 <blackdog> uh, 17:13
00:12:54 <skew> the hour or two where #haskell sleeps, punctuated only by occassional requests, and join messages...
00:12:59 <dons> hey
00:13:03 <blackdog> Tolja
00:13:04 <skew> maybe australians are out getting dinner?
00:13:12 <dons> too early
00:13:21 <dons> wazzup blackdog?
00:13:40 <blackdog> Hey don. If I have a value of type "CGI.CGI ()" where CGI is in the WASH package, i should be able to pdynload it, right?
00:13:56 <dons> hmm. maybe
00:14:02 <blackdog> answered my own question: it should be loading wash-cgi. hold on, i shall try
00:15:12 <blackdog> bah. can't get it going.
00:15:19 <blackdog> AutoCGI.getProgram/LoadFailure ["","/tmp/MgEKO25865.hs:3:","    Failed to load interface for `CGI':","\tCould not find interface file for `CGI'","\t(use -v to see a list of the files searched for)"]
00:15:38 <dons> is it a non-auto package?
00:15:50 <blackdog> ... non-auto?
00:15:58 <dons> because I'm not sure we  can pass  -package foo flags
00:16:25 <blackdog> isn't that what the third arg to pdynload is?
00:16:56 <dons> that's for extra package.confs
00:17:03 <blackdog> oh. oops.
00:17:10 <dons> do you need to compile normal programs with explicit -package cgi ?
00:17:16 <dons> (or whatever the package is)
00:17:18 <blackdog> Yep
00:17:25 <blackdog> am i SOL?
00:17:35 <dons> hmm.. so how to get that flag through to unify()
00:18:08 <dons> hacking hs-plugins now for you..
00:18:22 <blackdog> sounds like a lovesong dedication
00:18:25 <blackdog> thanks don
00:32:31 <dons> I wish darcs expanded $Id$ tags, just for fun.
00:33:06 <dons> blackdog, new hs-plugins snapshot up. implements pdynload_
00:33:43 <dons> new 4th argument, [Arg], for example ["-package","cgi"]
00:38:48 <blackdog> Cheers. (of course, now i get a bus error when trying to use ghci -package WASH, which i imagine is a prerequisite for plugins to work.
00:39:39 <dons> you'll need to fix that probably
00:40:15 <blackdog> still, it looks like it should be pretty easy to fit acquisition in. Only for cgi scripts for the moment, but it should be extensible to other things.
00:52:20 <Mask> how can I use an Ix in a type synonym?
00:57:29 <dons> newtype, perhaps?
00:57:30 <dons> newtype Ix a => T a = T (a,a)
01:07:19 <dons> @uptime
01:07:20 <lambdabot> uptime: 5 hours, 6 minutes and 9 seconds
01:15:38 <blackdog> dons: any update on the hs-plugins darcs repo?
01:15:52 <dons> working on it now
01:16:10 <dons> i figure that darcs means people will send me patches, right?
01:16:22 <dons> i've heard that's how it works.
01:16:29 <blackdog> dons: maybe. Does anyone understand the inner working of hs-plugins but you?
01:16:46 <blackdog> I'll certainly send you bugs and feature requests. :)
01:17:20 <dons> I think nibro knows fairly well. and some of the perl guys seem to have a good understanding.
01:20:00 <blackdog> i was going to ask about darcs, lambdabot and vixen - I'd like to set up a separate vixen repo so i can maintain the web and command line frontends.  that seems to mean that there's some crossover - is it possible to set up sub-repositories and sync between them?
01:21:00 <dons> probably. not sure.
01:21:50 <blackdog> what's next for hs-plugins, anyway?
01:23:06 <dons> I'm thinking of a cleanup for 6.4 support, and then release 0.9.10
01:23:24 <dons> after that, Peter Thiemann had some suggestions, and there's some stuff yi needs that I'd like
01:23:32 <dons> beyond that, I'd like ghci-based eval.
01:24:05 <blackdog> i thought eval was based on ghci already...
01:24:22 <dons> nah, just a private tree i'm hacking on for this year's HW
01:24:48 <dons> needs -package ghc
01:27:39 <dons> I'll probably look to sanitise the api a bit too, and make the tree a bit smaller
01:38:25 <pimaniac> does lambdabot have any dependencies?
01:38:47 <hellish> pimaniac: hs-plugins
01:39:26 <hellish> pimaniac: but you can live without them, you just don't get dynamic (un)loading
01:39:38 <pimaniac> hellish: hence the plugins errors i was getting :)
01:40:01 <dons> support for building without hs-plugins is a bit untested currently
01:40:09 <dons> it's possibly, but you'll have to hack a few lines by hand
01:41:47 <pimaniac> dons: should i test that, or should i get hs-plugins?
01:42:48 <dons> just get hs-plugins :)
01:45:24 <hellish> is there a way to get ghc to just do typechecking?
01:45:28 * hellish wants a vim macro
01:46:56 <dons> here you go:
01:47:03 <dons> FILE=$*
01:47:04 <dons> DECL=`cat`
01:47:04 <dons> ID=`echo $DECL | sed 's/^\([^ ]*\).*/\1/'`
01:47:04 <dons> echo ":t $ID" | ghci-6.4 -Onot -v0 -cpp -fglasgow-exts -w $FILE
01:47:04 <dons> echo $DECL
01:47:15 <dons> :map ty :.!typeOf %^M
01:48:21 <dons> so, the above is a script to run ghci over the current file
01:49:28 <dons> you place the cursor on the top-level decl you want the type of, and then hit 'ty'.
01:49:44 <dons> you get back the type of that decl. in the process the file gets typed.
01:50:16 <dons> if you just want to check that your file typechecks, then a map to ghc -fno-code might be useful
01:50:30 <blackdog> dons: i can see why you want yi. :)
01:50:48 <dons> vimscript should DIE!
01:52:13 * dons hits "darcs record --all"' in hs-plugins/
01:52:24 <hellish> dons: thanks a lot.
01:53:59 <dons> note that that stuff above is a shell script, except for the :map line, which is what you stick in .vimrc
01:55:53 <hellish> dons: ack, there's a problem somewhere. It overwrites my source file with: Warning: ignoring unrecognised input `IRC.hs^M'
01:55:53 <hellish> <interactive>:1:0: Not in scope: `ircSignalMessage'
01:56:13 <dons> if there's a type error.
01:56:23 <dons> the idea is that it generates type decls for you.
01:56:42 <dons> which it inserts into the line above the line your function  is on
01:56:54 <hellish> dons: maybe it doesn't work if it isn't exported?
01:56:55 <dons> you could hack it to be a general yes/no type check function though
01:57:00 <dons> yep.
01:57:09 <rasfar> That ^M needs to be a control char, not a caret then M.
01:57:12 <dons> hmm. no, if it is interpreted in ghci, it should work.
01:57:13 <blackdog> don - how do you get hs-plugins to build with DEBUG on?
01:57:25 <rasfar> (I didn't reinstall yet.)
01:57:30 <dons> rasfar: yep. good point.
01:57:39 <dons> blackdog, add -DDEBUG to config.mk
01:58:04 <blackdog> any particular line?
01:58:25 <dons> hellish, e.g. from:
01:58:25 <dons> insertUpd f = insertWith (\_ -> f)
01:58:29 <dons> it generates:
01:58:34 <dons> insertUpd :: forall a k.
01:58:34 <dons>          (Ord k) =>
01:58:34 <dons>          (a -> a) -> k -> a -> Map k a -> Map k a
01:58:46 <dons> which you then edit to get a compilable type.
01:59:06 <dons> blackdog, hmm. GHC_EXTRA_OPTS ?
02:00:25 <pimaniac> i now have a working lambdabot!  yay!
02:00:33 <dons> yay!
02:00:50 <dons> @karma+ pimaniac
02:00:51 <lambdabot> pimaniac's karma has been incremented
02:01:16 <basti_> hi
02:01:43 <blackdog> something i was curious about: is there a #haskell Hall of Infamy somewhere? I know what a few of you reprobates look like, but it'd be interesting to see the rest...
02:02:01 <rasfar> hi basti_
02:11:24 * rasfar goes beddie-bye
02:11:31 <pimaniac> gnight
02:11:42 <rasfar> gnight piman
02:12:40 * pimaniac is poking lambdabot with a stick.
02:13:05 <lambdabot> ouch!
02:13:42 <pimaniac> sorry, i meant my lambdabot.
02:13:58 <pimaniac> and tell me it said that by itself :)
02:14:39 <kaol> @yow
02:14:41 <lambdabot> Do you like "TENDER VITTLES"?
02:17:40 <pimaniac> muhaha.  i just understood a line of haskell code.  yay!
02:17:54 <blackdog> step 2: write lambdabot module.
02:17:57 <blackdog> step 3: ...
02:18:03 <basti_> lol
02:18:07 <basti_> PROFIT?
02:18:11 <pimaniac> step 4: profit!
02:18:19 <blackdog> Don't be silly, no-one makes any money writing haskell.
02:18:24 <dons> blackdog, hs-plugins darcs repo up at usual location.
02:18:28 <dons> @version
02:18:29 <lambdabot> lambdabot 2p417, GHC 6.4 (OpenBSD i386)
02:18:29 <lambdabot> darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
02:18:35 <pimaniac> basti_: we walked into that one.
02:18:35 <dons> s/lambdabot/hs-plugins
02:18:54 <basti_> :)
02:18:55 <blackdog> dons: i could kiss you, if the agency hadn't made me promise not to.
02:19:25 <dons> I thank you for that small mercy
02:19:50 <basti_> dons: i now know how to do that character - command association in Yi decently.
02:20:02 <dons> ah, cool!
02:20:09 <dons> any further progress on the emacs binding then?
02:20:46 <basti_> uh no that was what i was stuck on
02:20:48 <Cale> blackdog: I made some money writing Haskell code
02:20:56 <basti_> i didnt think it made sense going on before i know how to do that
02:21:21 <blackdog> Cale: go on, rub it in.
02:21:27 <dons> Cale enters #haskell hall of fame
02:21:48 <blackdog> Does it count if your boss doesn't know you're using Haskell?
02:21:59 <dons> hehe.
02:22:10 <dons> @sneaky+ blackdog
02:22:11 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @listcommands.
02:22:30 <pimaniac> should i work on a sneaky module?
02:22:33 <blackdog> dons: thanks, but i'd prefer there not to be a public record of how sneaky i am.
02:22:46 <dons> hehe. and persistent for free!1
02:22:46 <blackdog> inhibits my sneakines, y'see.
02:23:11 <dons> you then have to be extra sneaky to reach higher levels
02:23:12 <pimaniac> they freaked where i worked because i wrote something in Ruby.  i could imagine the haskell reaction. :-)
02:23:39 <blackdog> pimaniac: web stuff?
02:24:01 <pimaniac> blackdog: large scale text processing
02:24:19 <blackdog> what's your usual environment for that? perl?
02:24:49 <pimaniac> i knew perl, but ruby was new, shiny, and a little cleaner
02:25:52 <pimaniac> everything else there is web/database stuff written in vb/vbscript
02:26:00 <blackdog> yuck
02:26:20 <pimaniac> they bought books on my recommendation: programming ruby, and mastering regex
02:26:29 <blackdog> although i'd love an editor as smooth as the VB ide.
02:26:49 <pimaniac> blackdog: its nice?
02:26:51 * hellish hopes he didn't break anything
02:26:57 <hellish> hellbot: @yow
02:26:59 <hellbot> Couldn't find fortune file
02:27:05 <Cale> The graphical editing bit of the VB ide is nice, but the textual it is pretty poor.
02:27:05 <blackdog> pimaniac: it has intellisense. i really, really like intellisense.
02:27:10 <Cale> bit*
02:27:10 <hellish> hellbot: @plugs 5+5
02:27:18 <pimaniac> intellisense? :-P
02:27:27 <hellbot> Compiled, but didn't create object
02:27:31 <mflux> btw, is there a haskell-compatible *tags-tool?
02:27:32 <blackdog> Cale: true. it'd be painful for large scale text manipulation.
02:27:34 <pimaniac> i have an academic version of .net studio, but havent played with
02:27:54 <dons> hellbot : you need to build runplugs with ghc-6.2.2
02:27:54 <mflux> tags (and searching them in emacs) are really nice when dealing with lots of c-code
02:27:54 <blackdog> pimaniac: when it knows the possible options and gives you a drop down menu as you're typing.
02:28:03 <dons> s/hellbot/hellish/
02:28:08 <pimaniac> ah, like the completion in netbeans
02:28:16 <blackdog> i'd like a haskell-aware intellisense. :) only suggest something if the type could fit.
02:28:18 <hellish> dons: why?
02:28:20 <pimaniac> i didnt learn any java that year :)
02:28:31 <mflux> also ocaml has this -dtypes-switchi which will create an annotation, so you can browse the file and ask for the type of the symbol under the cursor - sometimes convenient
02:28:38 <blackdog> except i don't have the time to write it. or the type theory, either...
02:28:40 <pimaniac> i think emacs could have a nice mode like that...
02:28:43 <mflux> s/,/ file,/
02:28:53 <dons> there's some bug with hs-plugins/ghc-6.4 and runplugs that I haven't solved yet.
02:29:00 <blackdog> pimaniac: hippie-expand, do you mean?
02:29:05 <dons> you get that message if you hit the bug.
02:29:08 <blackdog> CEDET was meant to do something clever, but I couldn't get it working.
02:29:11 <pimaniac> blackdogs: it would have to unify types, right?
02:29:26 <pimaniac> blackdog: well, slime pulls declarations for lisp functions
02:29:40 <blackdog> I haven't used slime
02:30:05 <pimaniac> blackdog:  cursor on function, declaration shows up at bottom.  what does hippie-expand do?
02:31:17 <hellish> hellbot: @part #haskell
02:31:17 <boegel> hello everyone
02:31:41 <blackdog> pimaniac: that's not quite what i mean. Sure, it's nice to see the type, but not quite what i'd like.
02:32:19 <blackdog> I'd like the editor to be a way of exploring new modules, so you can get a sense of how a module fits together
02:32:25 <blackdog> i'm explaining this very badlyy
02:33:01 <pimaniac> no problem.  try your best, and ill see if i can figure out what you mean
02:35:46 <pimaniac> explore in what way?
02:35:52 <blackdog> Ok.  Just say you're looking into WASH, like I am now. if you're setting up a template, it might expect an HTML combinator in a certain context, so after typing "ta" it might suggest "table". There could be other things that could fit in, so you should be able to type and just ignore it, but tab-completion or something similar would be nice.
02:36:36 <blackdog> it should be even easier in haskell, because you have all this rich type information to help you cut down the possible options.
02:43:16 <blackdog> does that make sense? it's hard to get across how useful this is, especially when you don't necessarily know the library well. (and if you _do_ know it well enough to have memorised it, why haven't you automated that bit yet? :)
02:44:02 <blackdog> Huzzah! I got acquisition working with HWS-WP!
02:44:11 <pimaniac> yes, makes sense.  silence was because i was looking up possible tools :)
02:46:11 <pimaniac> i think semantic bovinator would need a haskell mode
02:46:31 <blackdog> CEDET is the umbrella project for semantic bovinator, I think.
02:46:45 <blackdog> i spent a few days trying to get it working on macos x and finally gave up.
02:46:59 <pimaniac> on the carbon build?
02:47:03 <blackdog> yeeah
02:47:17 <blackdog> which is still pretty alpha
02:48:00 <pimaniac> maybe aquamacs is a bit better
02:48:43 <blackdog> i'm a bit partial to xemacs... still, i'll give it a go. i've reverted to vim lately, just to get some work done...
02:50:13 <pimaniac> im trying to get a consistent editor across 4 operating systems, and something i can teach to my underlings, so im picking up more and more gnu emacs
02:51:03 <blackdog> underlings is a very funny word.
02:51:10 <blackdog> are you an evil scientist?
02:51:29 <pimaniac> evil, yes.  scientist, no.
02:51:43 <blackdog> (and surely aquamacs would be a backwards step? the interface is deliberately macish, right?)
02:51:44 <pimaniac> sorta a tutor where i go to school
02:51:53 <pimaniac> deliberately macish
02:52:03 <pimaniac> but additions, not subtractions, it seems
02:52:21 <blackdog> C-x C-f still works, then?
02:52:47 <pimaniac> i hope to god it does.  otherwise, im spending time downloading 33 megs over a dialup.
02:52:58 <pimaniac> s/spending/wasting/g
02:53:14 <hellish> @type words
02:53:16 <lambdabot> words :: String -> [String]
02:54:19 <hellish> @plugs words "moo?"
02:54:21 <lambdabot> ["moo?"]
02:54:27 <pimaniac> vim might be an option, but emacs seems to play nicely with dynamic languages
02:54:55 <pimaniac> i might teach my underlings cream if emacs turns out to be too much
02:55:21 <pimaniac> @plugs words "words is a nifty thing, kinda like split?"
02:55:23 <lambdabot> ["words","is","a","nifty","thing,","kinda","like","split?"]
02:55:30 <pimaniac> yay!
02:55:35 <blackdog> yeah. emacs does seem a lot more programmable/malleable... don does amazing things with vimscript, but they always look like line noise.
02:55:55 <blackdog> oh god, i can't believe i'm having the vi/emacs discussion again. i must be too old for this by now.
02:56:18 <pimaniac> might just need getting used to.  haskell is looking might strange to me, right now
02:56:23 <dons> hence yi. we know haskell is the language to write stuff in, so let's have a haskell editor!
02:56:40 <blackdog> it's strange in a good way, as the actress said to the bishop.
02:56:40 <dons> a couple of years time yi will be very useful, i reckon.
02:57:05 <dons> blackdog, you're very BAD.
02:57:51 <pimaniac> APL would make a nice vimscript language
02:57:51 <blackdog> thanks. i do my best.
02:59:07 <JohnMeacham> I hope yi has a nice lazy functional evaluation model. One of the most anoying things about vim is the way you program modes, you hook the window enter and exit events and change the mode accordingly for the current buffer. I'd prefer a pure function of what the current buffer is looking at to the current mode..
02:59:10 <blackdog> dons: think you'll still be hacking on it in a few years time?
02:59:43 <dons> I reckon so. <Fingers crossed>
03:00:06 <blackdog> dons: fingers crossed for luck or for lying?
03:00:09 <JohnMeacham> I think a dataflow type language would be very nice. I keep on meaning to write a dedicated extension language in haskell which is actually a lazy dataflow language. for use in ginsu, but it would probably be useful for something like yi too.
03:00:17 <dons> blackdog, for luck.
03:00:29 <dons> hmm. interesting idea John.
03:01:07 <dons> but I'd like to just use Haskell as the extension language. we need to be able to call ghci directly at runtime though. /me keeps hacking
03:01:36 <JohnMeacham> I was thinking of making a pure-type-system base, which takes type parameters which you can fill in with the 'meat' of your application. it could be very reusable.
03:01:37 <TheHunter> hey dons
03:01:52 <dons> hey TheHunter. thanks for @uptime :)
03:01:59 <TheHunter> @uptime
03:02:01 <lambdabot> uptime: 7 hours and 49 seconds
03:03:04 <JohnMeacham> Well, it is something different than an extension language. youd like a way to specify a function from text buffer contents to colorization. or file mode to key bindings. pure functions, the dataflow part comes in because they should be continually applied to the changing buffer... not sure if this makes sense.
03:03:32 <JohnMeacham> although, it would subsume a lot of the functionality of an extension language.
03:05:01 <musasabi> morning
03:05:13 <dons> hmm. a nice library for writing this kind of code would be cool
03:06:04 <JohnMeacham> hmm.. I really liked a lot of ideas from the 'sam' editor. moreso than the later 'acme' editor. the sam editor concept combined with the more powerful regular expression models of today could be a very nice editor foundation.
03:07:17 <JohnMeacham> Although, both paradigms would actually work well together. acme had a unified mousing model which I could see being useful in most any editor.
03:07:38 <musasabi> sam was technically good, acme is quite good from an usablity perspective.
03:08:24 * musasabi still uses acme from time to time and the interface seems to beat all other editors I know. 
03:09:28 <blackdog> musasabi: what did it do so well?
03:09:43 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, but acme was very 'shallow' in a sense. it was very good at a lot of stuff, and had a very 'clear' concept behind it.  but hard to get more advanced functionality out of. sam's model of the 'dot' and the commands was pretty much exactly what I want, but with the ability to work on higher level structures than just text.
03:09:58 <hellish> @pointless (\m -> (take ((length (words m) - 1) (words m)))
03:10:01 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 49):
03:10:01 <lambdabot> unexpected end of input
03:10:01 <lambdabot> expecting variable, "(", operator or ")"
03:10:14 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: maybe one could combine the models somehow.
03:10:29 <hellish> @pointless (\m -> (take ((length (words m) - 1) (words m))))
03:10:30 <lambdabot> take . s (subtract 1 . length . words) words
03:10:34 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, I don't think it would be that hard. I have given this some thought before.
03:10:50 <musasabi> blackdog: the UI just feels right - one of the few apps one can use mouse in a sensible fashion.
03:10:58 <JohnMeacham> http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/sam/sam.html some sam info... there is a better more academic paper floating around somewhere too which I highly recommend.
03:11:09 <hellish> @type s
03:11:10 <lambdabot> bzzt
03:11:29 <dons> "citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pike87text.html", maybe?
03:11:39 <dons> Pike, "The Text Editor sam"
03:11:44 <JohnMeacham> hmm.. looks like it is the right one.
03:12:02 <dons> yeah, I found this useful a few times when writing yi.
03:12:23 <musasabi> However sam is not very nice to actually use despite it being technically good.
03:13:01 <JohnMeacham> A problem with acme was that it really really needed the mouse. it had no fallback mechanism for doing advanced editing stuff. a wily mousing model on top of sam or even vim would be a powerful combination.
03:13:36 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, I think that was the problem endemic to all of plan 9 :)
03:13:46 <tic> JohnMeacham, an archaic version of C used :)
03:14:10 <tic> "wily mousing model", what do you mean?
03:14:22 <tic> :set mouse=a  works. ;)  although I suppose some context menus and such would be nice to have
03:14:31 <JohnMeacham> oh. wily is an acme clone. so substitute one for the other freely.
03:14:48 <tic> never used acme.  what's good about it?
03:14:53 <tic> I usually use ViM
03:15:11 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: wily had some problems iirc.
03:15:21 <musasabi> (and one can get acme on *nix with plan9ports)
03:15:48 <tic> wonder if I should try to learn how to use multiple delete buffers in Vim
03:16:02 <JohnMeacham> it was an experimental plan 9 editor. acme and sam both were, but were pretty different from each other but both had very interesting things to offer. I'd say neither was good enough as-is for full-scale use simply due to their experimental nature, but their ideas are quite ripe for the picking.
03:16:05 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: actually acme had support for more advanced things...
03:16:57 <JohnMeacham> I only used wily for a while, never the original acme. so my info could be out of date.
03:17:21 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: the thing is that you can have arbitary commands which you can execute from acme e.g. "mk" and you can edit the contents of the buffer from external commands (because it is mounted as a filesystem in plan9)
03:17:57 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: so e.g. regexp replace works quite fine ;)
03:18:39 <JohnMeacham> yeah, did plan 9 have a cool new take on 'sed'? I can't remember. I have the source sitting somewhere. in plan-9 psuedo-C of course.
03:20:20 <musasabi> I think the sed is an extension of plain sed, but so is the GNU one too.
03:20:42 <JohnMeacham> ah.
03:20:48 <musasabi> actually the plan9 C dialect is no worse than code using gcc extensions most of the time.
03:21:02 <JohnMeacham> Except gcc is eaiser to find :)
03:21:29 <musasabi> yes, nowadays.
03:21:43 <JohnMeacham> I didn't think the extensions were a bad idea. I certainly did want some of them when doing OS work. but it did make it somewhat tricky to reuse code.
03:23:18 <musasabi> The acme model will be kind of hard on *nix because it does not support user level filesystems which make it hard to allow external programs to interoperate with the editor.
03:23:27 <JohnMeacham> There was a cool paper I read once about how the 'longest-leftmost' rule for regexes pretty much broke most of their nice theoretical properties and how the 'shortest non-nesting' rule got them back, and showed how you could match really complex stuff easily if you used this rule. I always thought regexes based on this model would be great for a sam-like editor.
03:24:21 <JohnMeacham> yeah, but wily was usable. I used it quite  a bit before I switched to vim.
03:25:43 <JohnMeacham> Hmm.. I wish I could find this paper. the problem is basically that all the nice regular expression properties apply to the context of string _matching_. when extended to the domain of finding matching substrings things get more complicated and the POSIX 'longest-leftmost' rule was not well thought out at all.
03:26:56 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - On the use of regular expressions for searching text?
03:27:04 <JohnMeacham> Hmm.. that read oddly. I meant the difference between deciding if a string matches a regular expression and finding a string which matches a regular expression that is a subset of another string.
03:27:21 <JohnMeacham> dbremner: hrm?
03:28:16 <JohnMeacham> Ah, Yeah. that might be the one. Wow. people are great at finding papers based on vauge descriptions here :)
03:29:40 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - I googled for "shortest non-nesting regex" and the title was mentioned on the first link.
03:30:23 <JohnMeacham> Ah. I guess no one else has used that term. citeseer is down at the moment.... hmm.. but thanks!
03:33:07 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - np. plg.uwaterloo.ca/~ftp/mt/TechReports/CS-95-07/regexp.ps
03:35:29 <dbremner> JohnMeacham - that's a copy of the paper. The topic came up at a user group meeting I went to on Wednesday.
03:42:56 <JohnMeacham> Ah. cool.
03:51:44 <musasabi> JohnMeacham: are E sorts like kinds (in jhc) ?
03:58:21 <JohnMeacham> Yeah,
03:58:49 <JohnMeacham> E is very similar to Henk. that is probably the best paper on it.
03:59:38 <JohnMeacham> A value is of sort 'type' and a type is of sort '*' and * is of sort 'box'. ESort 0 is * and ESort 1 is box.
04:00:44 <musasabi> sounds sensible.
04:01:01 <JohnMeacham> http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/Papers/henk.ps.gz
04:01:08 <TheHunter> is it possible to compile things with jhc with 256MB of physical ram?
04:01:37 <JohnMeacham> Honestly, I get confused on the terminology sometimes. I would not be surprised if there are some errors in my comments or naming.
04:01:52 <JohnMeacham> Probably not, at least until I get pre-made 'ho' files set up.
04:02:19 <blackdog> large swapfile and zenlike patience?
04:02:27 <musasabi> hmm that is quite readable.
04:02:42 <TheHunter> ok, thanks.
04:02:59 <musasabi> Using with 512mb works fine (you need some swap but it doesn't trash too bad)
04:03:17 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, it is quite straightforward. The Lambda-Cube is actually a special case of PTSs or Pure Type Systems. so that is sometimes a better search term for finding info on them.
04:04:14 <musasabi> I'll push the haddock changes once I get E/* done (each in its own patch).
04:04:55 <JohnMeacham> There is a lot of pure theoretical information on them. but a dearth of info on using them as real-world programming. Adding things like case expressions and let statements can really change things :)
04:05:17 <JohnMeacham> feel free to send patches incrementally.
04:05:29 <JohnMeacham> or whatever you want :)
04:06:54 <musasabi> I want to read and understand E/* so I won't make silly mistakes.
04:07:04 <JohnMeacham> I would like to find a PTS expert. There are a variety of 'side conditions' which need to be maintained in E but arn't part of the type system proper. I'd like to integrate them into the type system, but these things are brittle. I don't want to break it..
04:07:39 <JohnMeacham> Oh, I am sure there are plenty of silly mistakes already existing. I recently put out a patch deleting some files from E/
04:09:49 <JohnMeacham> Hmm.. I need to document these side conditions somewere central actually... they can sometimes be subtle. I am trying to track down a major bug. One such side condition is let-bound variables may never appear "at the type level" This doesn't mean can't appear in things that inhabit kind, but rather values in the type annotations of the terms... hmm.. I can't see any way for the type system to enforce that so I have to rely on
04:09:49 <JohnMeacham>  making sure the property is always preserved by any transformation.
04:11:35 <musasabi> Could GADTs help in making some of the constraints (how E can be nested) visible?
04:11:50 <JohnMeacham> Very possibly. it is something I meant to look into.
04:12:36 <JohnMeacham> my E formulation is a pretty old part of the compiler. I know it has problems.
04:18:18 <basti_> :-O
04:26:05 <blackdog> dons: around?
04:31:52 <hellish> @plugs (\l -> | l == 2 = "two"; |otherwise = "four") 5
04:31:53 <lambdabot> parse error on input `|'
04:32:17 <hellish> aww... no guards in lambda notation.
04:34:38 <dons> blackdog. yep.
04:34:58 <blackdog> Hey. I'm having a problem reloading objects
04:35:14 <JohnMeacham> Ah. found the strange dependency issues with HsParser... silly leading ./
04:35:37 <blackdog> the whole point of this acquisition stuff is to have stuff shadowed, right? If you can't find "index_html.hs" in this directory, look in the next one up, etc...
04:36:18 <blackdog> but when i try this, it works the first time, but then when it tries to reload it, it says it can't unload it because it can't find the file.
04:36:37 <blackdog> this is a little confusing. (I'm also not quite sure why it's reloading it at all... it hasn't changed.)
04:37:10 <blackdog> oh, and when you import c_unloadObj - where does that come from? grepping was no help, and i think that's where the error comes from
04:37:25 * blackdog is incoherent and sorry\
04:37:27 <dons> no idea. you sure it isn't checking the file's timestamp and dying at the point?
04:37:46 <dons> unloadObj et al. come from Linker.h in the ghc libs
04:37:57 <dons> include/Linker.h
04:38:10 <blackdog> i don't think so - i only get the problem when i switch to looking at the file in the other dir.
04:38:26 <blackdog> reloading
04:38:27 <blackdog> unloadObj: can't find `/home/mwotton/projects/HaskellWeb/Webserver/scripts/abcde/CGICounter.o' to unload
04:38:32 <dons> sounds  like paths are getting conufused some how.
04:38:39 <dons> does that file exist?
04:38:41 <blackdog> yep\
04:39:20 <blackdog> it's almost the same file in the abcde directory ant the one above it.
04:40:32 <dons> oh. that error is coming from the rts.
04:41:00 <dons> I think it means that you're asking to unload an object that has not been loaded.
04:41:16 <dons> or possibly, trying to unload an object with a different path to that used to load it.
04:41:37 <blackdog> ok, tried changing the name of the one in the other directory, and i don't get the problem, so i think it must be that it's got two files loaded with the same module name, and is getting horribly confused.
04:41:46 <dons> ah yes!
04:41:55 <dons> bad++
04:42:12 <dons> as the module name is appended to the symbol name to generate the true symbol.
04:42:22 <blackdog> Ok, but the point of acquisition is to do shadowing.
04:42:26 <dons> so they need to have either different names, or use the hierarchical name space.
04:42:53 <dons> can you make sure you never have both in memory at the same time?
04:42:57 <blackdog> i guess i could generate fake module names with makeWith... right?
04:43:08 <blackdog> No, can't do that. I might need them both within seconds of each other.
04:43:26 <dons> but unload is fairly cheap.
04:43:39 <dons> but makeWith would probably work too.
04:43:43 <blackdog> i could need them on the same page. :)
04:43:58 <dons> ok.
04:44:00 <blackdog> it's only the module name that needs to be changed?
04:44:10 <dons> yep. think so.
04:44:15 <dons> just make sure they're unique.
04:45:12 <blackdog> ok. given that i'm only exporting the one symbol, i can call the module anything at all
04:45:50 <dons> yeah. makeWith generates unique module names, doesn't it?
04:45:55 <dons> certainly eval does this.
04:46:10 <blackdog> you wrote it, you ought to know. :) I haven't used makeWith yet, just browsed the docs
04:46:48 <dons> trying to remember. somewhere in there is a function that generates unique files with mkstemps, and a module name to match.
04:47:00 <dons> replaceModName mrg_syn (mkModid $ basename out)
04:48:34 <dons> you might want to look at merge/mergeTo,mergeToDir. nibro needed them for his web server hacking
04:48:49 <blackdog> what was nibro doing?
04:48:50 <dons> ok. night!
04:48:59 <dons> oh, Haskell Server Pages.
04:49:00 * blackdog does not want to reinvent the wheel all squarelike
04:49:17 <blackdog> hm. should dl. oh well, hack first, research later. :)
04:49:20 <blackdog> g'night
04:49:24 <dons> ok.
04:49:25 <dons> ciao.
05:11:16 <blackdog> dons: cheers, worked a charm.
05:13:29 <Paltas> Go'eftermiddag Oejet :)
05:14:04 <blackdog> @seen shapr
05:14:05 <lambdabot> I haven't seen shapr.
05:18:57 <Oejet> Hej, Paltas.
05:19:40 <Lemmih> Danskerne overta'r #haskell!
05:21:24 <Paltas> Lemmih, Ja vi goer saa :)
05:21:40 <Paltas> I guess we should fall back to english..
05:26:42 <basti_> as long as you dont talk hopi.
05:40:17 <Lemmih> @google hopi
05:41:09 <blackdog> Hey Lemmih. Do you feel like selling me on Hemplate? I need a ZPT style templating system, and i don't know whether to use it or halipeto...
05:41:59 <Lemmih> What's ZPT?
05:42:09 <blackdog> Zope Page Templates
05:42:37 <blackdog> html-compatible templates with commands hidden in the 'tal' namespace inside tags.
05:42:43 <blackdog> doesn't hemplate work similarly?
05:42:59 <Lemmih> Yeah.
05:43:56 <Lemmih> If you need to generate dynamic templates then Hemplate is pretty much the only way to go. (:
05:45:08 <blackdog> well, i'd only pinch the templating stuff - i want to use it inside hws-wp instead of WASH.
05:47:19 * basti_ goes take another Yi-Emacs session
05:47:22 <blackdog> hm. just checked halipeto - i see what you mean. i don't much fancy just generating a set of static pages. :)
05:50:13 <Lemmih> blackdog: The templates in the Hackage repo is pretty much the only documentation.
05:50:23 <JohnMeacham> RemiTurk's bug in ghc looks interesting. 7x slowdown with -O. I wonder what is causing it.
05:51:04 <blackdog> Lemmih: ok. Are you merging in the changes musasabi made, or is he just forking it?
05:52:14 <Lemmih> He's forking it.
05:52:45 <musasabi> more like "he is too lazy to properly integrate things".
05:54:11 <Lemmih> musasabi: You only changed some details in the implementation, right?
05:54:31 <basti_> what complexity does "!" have? O(n)?
05:54:37 <Lemmih> So they still have the same interface?
05:54:58 <blackdog> basti_: yep
05:55:06 <basti_> -.-
05:55:15 <Lemmih> basti_: I think it's O(1).
05:55:26 <blackdog> if you need random access, you shouldn't be using lists. :)
05:55:36 <basti_> hm.
05:55:36 <blackdog> oh, wait: that's !!. sorry
05:55:38 <Lemmih> blackdog: (!) is for arrays (:
05:55:45 <basti_> ahh.
05:55:45 <blackdog> yeah, it's getting late. :)
05:55:56 <musasabi> Lemmih: yes interfaces should be same, I added some documentation, 6.4 fixes, and various things to get it compile without haskelldb.
05:55:56 * basti_ feels a lot more relaxed now
05:57:32 <Lemmih> blackdog: musasabi's version might be better for use with hws-wp. Mine is geared at Hackage.
05:58:25 <blackdog> ok, i might use that then. cheers.
05:58:36 <musasabi> but musasabi's version hasn't seen a lot of love in the recent times.
05:59:00 <musasabi> but feel free to use it.
05:59:30 <blackdog> :q
05:59:39 <blackdog> ... duh. duh duh duh. sorry.
06:00:11 <blackdog> going through it now. thanks.

06:22:48 * basti_ is in a dilemma
06:22:51 <Paltas> Lemmih, Are you also a student, which is interested in haskell?
06:23:02 <basti_> either i lose transparency, or my keybinding will be stupid.
06:23:30 <Paltas> Lemmih, i'm importing system.io, network
06:23:52 <basti_> Paltas: thats not the problem

06:24:07 <Paltas> basti_, how will it come then?
06:24:13 <basti_> Paltas: you seem to have problems with "that funny IO thing", thats normal for haskell beginners ;)
06:24:20 <basti_> do you know what IO is for?
06:24:38 <basti_> and, what it is?
06:24:40 <Paltas> basti_, I found out there is problems about IO String and String fx.
06:24:42 <GunZ> hey guys what are some well known haskell programs?
06:25:02 <basti_> "well known" among whom? :P
06:25:02 <Paltas> basti_, Hmm.. an algebraic type?
06:25:03 <Lemmih> GunZ: GHC, darcs.
06:25:08 <basti_> Paltas: hmm.
06:25:14 <basti_> Paltas: not directly.
06:25:43 <Paltas> It just seems so :)
06:25:52 <basti_> Paltas: did you observe that "that IO thing" forces you to "have an IO type" whenever you do IO?
06:25:56 <Lemmih> GunZ: Google for Aetion and Galois.
06:26:09 <GunZ> Lemmih: ok thx
06:26:26 <Paltas> basti_, By using something <- something_io solves it?
06:26:30 <basti_> uhm?
06:26:38 <basti_> actually the situation is more complicated
06:26:55 <Paltas> fx. ha <- openFile filename ReadMode, ha should be of type Handle?
06:27:20 <basti_> lets work through this with the concentration necissairy.
06:27:21 <basti_> ;)
06:27:33 <Paltas> Our lecturer told us about 20 minuttes about IO so not mutch I know of it :(
06:27:48 <Paltas> basti_, and how do we do that? :)
06:28:10 <basti_> well first let's see what IO is.
06:28:24 <basti_> IO is in the type system.
06:28:31 <basti_> and it has a parameter.
06:28:49 <basti_> that means, for every type "a" you can have an "IO a"
06:28:53 <Paltas> it seems to work out like an algebraic type? I mean same concept?
06:28:54 <basti_> (if you want or need so)
06:29:05 <basti_> its a type class.
06:29:12 <Paltas> ah ofcause
06:29:20 <basti_> but thats something different to classes in Java or C.
06:29:29 <basti_> so don't think it would be easy :P
06:29:29 <Paltas> I know, i've been taking a course in haskell
06:29:34 <basti_> i see.
06:29:38 <Paltas> but properly not mutch to figure this peroblem out
06:29:41 <basti_> that makes things easier.
06:29:44 <Paltas> (we read thomson)
06:30:10 <basti_> the intuitive meaning of an "IO a" thing is, it is an "a" that needs some sort of IO to "happen".
06:30:32 <Paltas> aha.
06:30:48 <Paltas> I see,
06:31:06 <basti_> a function of Type "Int->IO String" would be one, that, given an Int, does some IO and then gives you a String
06:31:24 <Paltas> makes sense. :)
06:31:30 <basti_> yes so far.
06:31:50 <basti_> ;)
06:31:56 <basti_> now it gets tricky.
06:31:56 <Paltas> but it would be further?
06:32:03 <Paltas> Ok :)
06:32:14 <basti_> maybe we got a function like getChar
06:32:18 <basti_> @type getChar
06:32:24 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- getChar :: IO Char
06:32:44 <basti_> it needs nothing and gives us an "Char", "after" some IO
06:33:05 <Paltas> would test <- getChar, give test a char?
06:33:12 <basti_> "kinda" ;)
06:33:37 <basti_> its like that: to tell your environment that you're working "with IO", you need a special notation
06:33:50 <basti_> under the hood some magic happens that does the IO stuff
06:34:06 <basti_> all you will notice in your code is:
06:34:08 <Paltas> the special notation is <- ?
06:34:16 <basti_> a) what you expect would happen
06:34:23 <basti_> b) you can't get rid of "IO"
06:34:40 <basti_> (everything happens with "that stupid IO thing" watching)
06:34:46 <basti_> an important keyword would be "do".
06:34:51 <basti_> try in hugs: "do getChar"
06:34:56 <Paltas> it's really annoying.. :)
06:35:09 <basti_> yes it is, but because you don't understand what it does for you
06:35:11 <Paltas> work out.
06:35:22 <basti_> actually it keeps you from shooting yourself in the foot.
06:35:28 <basti_> huh?
06:35:38 <Paltas> nevermind
06:35:50 <basti_> did you try "do getChar"?
06:35:54 <Paltas> yep
06:35:56 <Paltas> and it works
06:35:59 <basti_> good.
06:36:03 <basti_> like you would expect
06:36:11 <Paltas> yep.
06:36:21 <Paltas> because do allows us to ignore return value?
06:36:21 <basti_> some magic is happening, your interpreter waits for you to press a key, and then the keystroke is returned
06:36:28 <basti_> no. its not ignored.
06:36:44 <Paltas> what then?
06:36:52 <basti_> "do" is the "escape"
06:37:02 <basti_> it tells our environment "do magic with that stupid IO thing"
06:37:11 <Paltas> ahh!
06:37:20 <basti_> but beware!
06:37:33 <basti_> try ":t (do getChar)"
06:37:37 <Paltas> beware of the stupid io .. yes :)
06:37:46 <basti_> (:t would print you the type of almost any expression)
06:37:56 <Paltas> do {...} :: IO Char
06:38:00 <Paltas> hmm..
06:38:08 <basti_> you see it's still "inside that IO thing"
06:38:22 <basti_> but now our environment knows what to do about that.
06:38:43 <Paltas> that's why our last statement needs to be a expression.
06:38:50 <basti_> hmmm not really. :)
06:38:54 <basti_> try: do {t<-getChar;return t}
06:38:57 <Paltas> in the do?
06:39:09 <basti_> ({ and ; are synonymous to line break & indentation)
06:39:25 <Paltas> Yes ok.
06:39:33 <basti_> I'm going the zen way of teaching, since i won't be able to tell you directly what IO is. I'll show you how it works
06:40:06 <Paltas> Hm. Ok
06:40:15 <basti_> actually this snippet is kinda intuitively understandable
06:41:17 <basti_> now we want to do something a little more interesting
06:41:30 <Paltas> That would be nice. :)
06:41:43 <basti_> (besides, what we wrote up there is equivalent to (do getChar), as you might understand without further explanation
06:42:04 <basti_> do {t<-getLine;putStr t}
06:42:16 <basti_> try to :t it too
06:42:17 <Paltas> Yep.
06:42:34 <Paltas> :: IO()
06:42:35 <basti_> It's type "IO ()"
06:42:42 <basti_> () is the "unit type"
06:42:51 <Paltas> because putStr returns IO() ?
06:42:56 <basti_> (kinda similar to C's void: there is just one value of it, and you can't do nothing with that value)
06:43:00 <basti_> yes right
06:43:03 <Paltas> yep know. :)
06:43:19 <basti_> and because the last line in a "do" statement always determines the type of your do statement
06:43:36 <Paltas> that's why it not may be let q = ...
06:43:46 <basti_> but it may, why?
06:44:21 <Paltas> hmm...
06:44:22 <Paltas> ?
06:44:39 <Paltas> the last line may not be let q = ...
06:44:44 <basti_> its not forbidden to use let as the last statement in a do expression
06:45:02 <basti_> it just needs to have the right type
06:45:24 <Paltas> so what we "let" will be returned?
06:45:30 <basti_> ("the right type" being a complex issue because of "that IO thing", as you might have expected)
06:45:35 <basti_> no.
06:45:38 <basti_> let works like:
06:45:50 <basti_> "let a=b in a" returns what was b before
06:46:20 <Paltas> yes ..
06:46:48 <basti_> so if b was a valid thing in your "do" expression, then such a line will return a valid thing again.
06:46:57 <Paltas> Prelude> :t do{let q = getChar()}
06:46:57 <Paltas> ERROR - Last generator in do {...} must be an expression
06:47:03 <Paltas> why doesn't this work out?
06:47:09 <basti_> because "let" breaks "do"
06:47:17 <Paltas> ahhh!!
06:47:25 <basti_> and because this "let" doesnt have an "in" clause and makes no sense anyway
06:47:52 <Paltas> ahh
06:48:20 <basti_> but anyway, inside that "in" clause, you would need to use another "do" (or some of the other measures to achieve the same effect) to get "that stupid IO thing" right
06:48:38 <Paltas> I see.
06:48:51 <basti_> so let's not consider let inside do for now.
06:48:56 <basti_> what do you actually want to do? :)
06:49:08 <Paltas> a practical joke? :)
06:49:14 <basti_> hm?
06:49:19 <basti_> i'm not joking at all
06:49:31 <basti_> I'm just telling the truth, as bizarre as it might sound
06:49:34 <Paltas> <basti_> what do you actually want to do? :) <- could be a practical haskell joke
06:49:43 <basti_> hehehe
06:49:43 <Paltas> basti_, I know. :)
06:49:45 <basti_> ok
06:50:50 <Paltas> basti_, but exactly why does openFile gives us a [t] ?
06:51:00 <basti_> are you sure it does?
06:51:07 * basti_ looks up
06:51:08 <Paltas> ghc thinks so :)
06:51:20 <basti_> @type openFile
06:51:22 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- bzzt
06:51:28 <basti_> hmm
06:51:35 <basti_> http://www.zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputio/openFile_f.html
06:51:39 <basti_> it does not.
06:51:57 <boegel> @index openFile
06:51:58 <basti_> given a path and a mode, it will give us a handle, after some IO
06:51:58 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- Unknown command.
06:52:22 <boegel> lambdabot: @index openFile
06:52:30 <Paltas> getExplain :: String -> String
06:52:30 <Paltas> getExplain x = do
06:52:30 <Paltas>     ha <- openFile explain_file ReadMode
06:52:30 <Paltas>     return(findInFile ha x)
06:52:30 <Paltas>                               
06:52:42 <Paltas> findInFile returns a String ..
06:52:46 <basti_> so the question you wanted to ask is: why does your compiler think that, what you think would become a handle, is a list?
06:53:00 <Lemmih> Paltas: getExplain :: String -> IO String
06:53:17 <basti_> that would be a measure.
06:53:25 <basti_> since you can't get rid of "that stupid IO thing"
06:53:42 <basti_> (there really is no way. no correct one, that is)
06:53:47 <Paltas> right.
06:53:52 <Paltas> I need to keep it all along?
06:53:57 <basti_> not all along.
06:54:03 <basti_> just where you depend on io stuff.
06:54:12 <Paltas> aha
06:54:26 <basti_> (most parts of the program won't, I hope.)
06:55:29 <basti_> findInFile most probably would, I think, and so does NOT need return, but an "IO" type
06:56:00 <Paltas> ofcause
06:56:00 <basti_> (return is just for annotating things with "IO" [for example])
06:56:57 <Lemmih> Paltas: (delayed a bit) No, I'm not a student.
06:57:16 <basti_> the error you pasted up there was a type error, btw., and haskell decides types "in both directions" (that means, your type error might come from a place BEHIND where it appears)
06:57:24 <Paltas> Lemmih, Okay.. Thought it was only students or former students which were interested in haskell :)
06:58:07 <Paltas> basti_, Yes It seems like i'm getting rid of it, because of what you've written to me, thanks alot. :)
06:58:30 <basti_> :)
06:58:30 <Paltas> I didn't get the point about keeping the IO thing all along where it's needed
06:58:51 <basti_> oh why?
06:59:01 <basti_> IO is "state"
06:59:08 <basti_> haskell doesn't have explicit "state"
06:59:17 <basti_> so there is a way of marking up where it depends on state
06:59:22 <theorbtwo> lambdabot: @type return
06:59:42 <Lemmih> return :: Monad m => a -> m a
07:00:03 <Paltas> but if i use hGetLine and will return the return value it will be IO String, because it comes out of a io operation?
07:00:20 <basti_> yes.
07:00:22 <basti_> and that makes sense.
07:00:30 <basti_> because you need to do IO to "get a line"
07:00:53 * TheHunter wonders what happened to lambdabot 
07:00:56 <Paltas> ofcause.
07:01:10 <Paltas> and now the shit compiles.. understanding is nice. :)
07:01:36 <Paltas> basti_, Vielen dank fur dein zeit. :)
07:04:06 <basti_> :)

07:32:45 * Lemmih throws angry lambdas at System.Process
07:35:15 <Lunar^> What does an angry lambda look like?
07:36:18 <sqrt> like this:  /(
07:37:39 <musasabi> Lemmih: not using System.Process may be easier.
07:38:17 <Lemmih> How so?
07:40:11 <musasabi> System.Posix may be easier.
07:40:45 <musasabi> at least I tried to use System.Process and then gave up and went with System.Posix.
07:46:05 <Lemmih> Yay. Just got it working.
07:47:04 <Lemmih> I wonder how much faster 'manyTill' would be in an arrow based library compared to Parsec.
07:52:24 <musasabi> Is there any nice tool to create graphical module dependency graphs?
07:55:23 * theorbtwo ponders writing one.
07:56:27 <musasabi> well that can be done quite easily..
07:56:36 <theorbtwo> graphviz, hs-plugins .hi file parser.
07:57:06 <musasabi> yep graphviz.
07:57:16 <musasabi> I was thinking "dirty perl regex".
08:06:30 <theorbtwo> I think the hi file parser will create better results.
08:06:42 <theorbtwo> I'm going to work on it; I could use the haskell work.
08:09:04 <theorbtwo> I certianly don't mind if you work on it too, we can compare when we both finish.
08:15:15 <dan2> whats a really good online book for learning haskell
08:17:13 <d`> dan2 read haskell.org
08:17:28 <d`> beginning with the `gentle introduction'
08:24:35 <musasabi> got a first version..
08:24:42 <Mask> What's wrong with "newtype Number = Num Int deriving (Num)"? Hugs says that I can't derive instances of class "Num", why not?
08:24:57 <musasabi> now it is making a little bit too large trees (images have a width of 36000 pixels etc)
08:25:35 <TheHunter> Mask, that's a ghc extension.
08:25:45 <TheHunter> hugs just doesn't have it.
08:27:40 <Mask> Num? really?
08:30:07 <TheHunter> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/type-extensions.html (7.4.12)
08:30:15 <TheHunter> works for arbitary newtypes.
08:30:24 <TheHunter> Num is not a derivable class.
08:35:49 <mornfall> dear folks
08:35:55 <mornfall> how do i make hugs trace my program? :-)
08:41:21 <dan2> does haskell have a modulus operator?

08:57:04 <Corion> Hello - using ghc 6.4 on Win32 (native) - how would I get the size of a file? Posix doesn't seem to exist on Win32, and calling Win32 DLL functions isn't clear to me ... Any hints?
08:57:25 <vegai> dan2: have you seen fib = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)
08:57:51 <vegai> okay, it's a bit different, but still
08:58:01 <Lemmih> Corion: System.IO.hFileSize
08:58:20 <Corion> Lemmih: Thanks! I'll look through System.io!
08:58:43 <Lemmih> You're welcome.
08:59:12 <Corion> Ow. And it wants an open file. D'oh :)
09:00:05 <Corion> Lemmih: And according to Google, you asked that question as well :)))
09:01:58 <Lemmih> Yeah.
09:02:41 <dan2> vegai: thats much slower
09:02:57 <vegai> dan2: really?
09:03:04 <dan2> vegai: yes
09:03:13 <vegai> huh
09:03:14 <dan2> vegai: mine calculates fibonacci in logarithmic time, not linear
09:03:20 <Lemmih> Corion: I settled for '\f -> bracket (openFile f ReadMode) hClose hFileSize'
09:03:50 <Corion> Lemmih: Yeah - I'm going the same route :) But I'll steal your code instead of coming up with my code now :))
09:04:05 <vegai> ok, didn't know you need that much fastness :)
09:05:05 <dan2> vegai: even speedier version
09:05:10 <dan2> using diffsquares function
09:05:12 <dan2> diffsquares a b = 2*(a-b)*b + (a-b)^2
09:05:24 <vegai> how large fibs do you need, anyway?
09:05:29 <dan2> 250000
09:05:50 <dan2> its my language benchmark ;)
09:06:08 <Corion> Lemmih: Works now, thanks!!
09:06:15 <Lemmih> Reading old IRC logs is kinda like looking at an old photo collection.
09:06:24 <vegai> yep, it does take a while to do fib !! 250000 with the lazy list implementation :)

09:16:41 <Lemmih> Oh, and you don't want (a!!0).
09:16:47 <theorbtwo> To promote an a to an IO a, use return.

09:20:32 <theorbtwo> That looks even worse.

09:23:06 <xerox> hi!
09:25:26 <dan2> how do I profile this
09:27:37 <dan2> ?
09:28:45 <Lemmih> dan2: Read the GHC User's Guide.
09:28:57 <dan2> I did -prof
09:29:02 <dan2> but no profiling coming out
09:29:24 <Lemmih> Section 5. Profiling.
09:35:25 <dan2> uhh
09:35:29 <dan2> how do I comment something out
09:38:32 <musasabi> -- rest of line, or {- a long comment -}
09:44:48 <bourbaki> is there something in the haskell standard libs that extracts you a grammar structure?
09:45:43 <theorbtwo> Parsec
09:46:37 <bourbaki> so i can build a grammer in BNF and it will return me the sentences structure?
09:47:26 <wilx> Huh.
09:47:49 <wilx> You would have to define your own AST.
09:47:57 <bourbaki> AST?
09:48:06 <wilx> Abstract Syntax Tree.
09:48:06 <theorbtwo> Abstract Syntax Tree
09:48:19 <bourbaki> i guess thats the same as BNF
09:48:27 <wilx> Nope.
09:48:34 <wilx> Oh.
09:48:35 <wilx> Well.
09:48:39 <wilx> What is the same?
09:48:43 <bourbaki> S -> N VP N ie
09:49:04 <bourbaki> er that was bullocks though ;)
09:49:07 <theorbtwo> No, a BNF describes all possible inputs.  An AST is a method of expressing a purticular input in a more abstract form.
09:49:59 <theorbtwo> (Generally a tree, thus the name.)
09:50:39 <bourbaki> hm
09:50:42 <theorbtwo> So 1 + 2 might have an AST with a root node being the + operator, and two child nodes, 1 and 2.
09:51:14 <bourbaki> ok but thats not really different from the BNF its just following as an instance of this
09:51:36 <theorbtwo> An AST is a form of an expression of a grammar.
09:51:37 <bourbaki> + -> A B, A -> 1, B -> 2
09:52:57 <bourbaki> hm
09:53:11 <bourbaki> ok but i would get the actual structure of an expression?
09:53:43 <bourbaki> i mean if i would do all expressions in that way i would just write down all possible instanciations wouldnt i?
09:53:58 <bourbaki> with the BNF its just in a generateive form
09:54:28 <wilx> Hmm.
09:54:52 <wilx> Do you know attribute grammaras?
09:54:58 <wilx> grammars even
09:55:29 <bourbaki> yes i think so
09:55:36 <wilx> Ok.
09:55:47 <bourbaki> it has been a bit that i have had my lecture on linguistics :)
09:56:17 <bourbaki> what i would like to have is something like an early parser or such
09:59:13 <wilx> So, attribute grammars allow you to "return" values constructed from right side of grammar's rules to left sides (synthetic attributes).
09:59:39 <wilx> If you make the return value such that it describes right side of the rule then you get AST :)
09:59:41 <wilx> Basically./
10:00:20 <bourbaki> basically this sounds as if it was easier to write it from stractch ;)
10:00:24 <bourbaki> er scratch
10:00:30 <wilx> Nope.
10:00:51 <wilx> Usually.
10:01:23 <wilx> I suggest you read the Parsec paper.
10:01:40 <bourbaki> maybe i should do that
10:02:16 <bourbaki> my prob most of the time is that it usually needs the same amount of time to read such papers and then fiddle around as i need to write an early parser or something similar
10:03:19 <wilx> What is "early parser"?
10:03:54 <bourbaki> sec
10:05:52 <bourbaki> http://www.cs.may.ie/~jpower/Courses/parsing/node51.html
10:08:16 <wilx> Huh.
10:08:31 <wilx> That is some kind of new parsing algo.
10:09:03 <wilx> It sounds little bit like paralel LR parsing done seqeuential :)
10:09:13 <bourbaki> well i dont know since i have done it in my introduction course and its also in that mit introduction book it cant be that new ;)
10:09:52 <wilx> I see.
10:10:14 <wilx> Well, I have never seen anything else than LR or LL parsing algos.
10:11:08 <jesse99> earley and packrat parsers are neat
10:11:32 <bourbaki> but i guess ill have to write one myself then
10:11:38 <JohnMeacham> Haskell has seen several novel parsing strategies recently. Packrat and koen's parallel parsing monad are both really cool.
10:11:55 <bourbaki> i want to rewite my NLP semantics thingy
10:12:07 <JohnMeacham> But simple monadic parsing combinators are a great way to see the (non-IO) power of monads...
10:12:24 <bourbaki> http://ai-depot.com/Articles/49/Semantics.html
10:13:14 <bourbaki> JohnMeacham: i need the actual structre though that all im interestied in maybe you guys want to have a look at that link and maybe you come up with a cool idea to wrap that into a monadic computation
10:13:51 <wilx> Well, you can get the structure with Parsec too.
10:15:19 <bourbaki> hm ok i guess haveing a look into the parsec paper wont kill me
10:15:29 <wilx> :)
10:16:03 <bourbaki> do you happen to know if there are planners written in haskell?
10:17:54 <JohnMeacham> Yeah, looks quite straightforward. something you don't seem to mention is backtracking. however, since you seem to want to deal with ambiguity. I might recommend an approach that returns a list of possible values. similar to how ReadS is implemented. Then you can choose the 'most likely' one and get all the alternatives for free. Parsec might make you decide on a path too early since it is designed more for unambiguous gramme
10:17:54 <JohnMeacham> rs. in any case, the concepts will be the same, just small tweaks to the underlying monad.
10:18:35 <bourbaki> righto
10:19:01 <bourbaki> the idea is to retrieve all the possible closures in this application
10:19:13 <bourbaki> the selection of them will be dealt with on another level
10:19:44 <bourbaki> ie the app will ask you to be more precise on the elements that lead to the ambiguity or select one at random or such
10:20:31 <bourbaki> JohnMeacham: so you think i sould have a look at the parsec parser?
10:20:55 <beschmi> there is support for ambiguous grammars in happy: http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.c.callaghan/happy-glr/
10:21:16 <JohnMeacham> Ah, then a parsec parser might be a bit too complicated as it tried to eagerly dispose of bad paths to avoid memory consumption.  however, the original formulations of monadic parsing combinators all returned all possible parses.
10:21:37 <JohnMeacham> ooh. that new happy feature might be useful too. I have not played with it yet.
10:22:34 <JohnMeacham> this is a good short-n-sweet paper.. http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/pearl.pdf
10:22:50 <bourbaki> ok thanks alot ill have a look at parsec and happy
10:22:54 <bourbaki> pearl?
10:23:13 <bourbaki> ah i always confuse perl and pearl :)
10:23:45 <JohnMeacham> It is a "Functional Pearl" it is only 8 pages and gives the core idea behind monadic parsing.
10:25:55 <bourbaki> thanks a lot
10:26:18 <bourbaki> i hope that it will be as easy to implement in haskell as in lisp :)
10:26:22 <JohnMeacham> That paper is quite good actually. combining the anciliary info needed too. I'd recommend it even if you eventually go with something else.
10:27:08 <JohnMeacham> Oh. I am sure it will be much easier. At least that is my experience when porting lisp code. but yeah..
10:27:19 <bourbaki> sure 8 pages are read quickly downloaded it already :)
10:27:20 <theorbtwo> I almost mentioned earlier that converting between LISP code an LISP AST is trivial.
10:28:17 <bourbaki> is there a toy app for haskell that extracts hidden messages from texts :)?
10:28:18 <beschmi> is haskell hard to parse? just looking at jhc and wondering which percentage of the FrontEnd code is dedicated to parsing
10:28:41 <JohnMeacham> There are more advanced papers on his main page. http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/ and a search for 'monadic parsing' turns up more.
10:28:42 <bourbaki> i just found a cool online lib with classic books would be fun to search if for hidden messages
10:28:46 <theorbtwo> (Mostly because the author of LISP never quite got around to deciding on a syntax, and eventually just decided to declare the lack of syntax a feature.)
10:29:06 <theorbtwo> Project gutenburg, bourbaki.
10:29:21 <JohnMeacham> Well, it wasn't too hard for me as I just reused the work from 'hatchet' which is based on the haskell parser that comes with the standard libraries.
10:29:26 <bourbaki> theorbtwo: i have found another one as well
10:29:54 <JohnMeacham> Although haskell is a tricky language, usually parsers for it are written in haskell making it quite easy to parse ;)
10:30:41 <bourbaki> theorbtwo: http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/languages/
10:30:58 <JohnMeacham> jhc's parser is written in happy. it is in FrontEnd/HsParser.ly if you want to take a look. it is long, but straightforward. I don't really like happy and might switch it to a packrat or monadic parser at some point to get more flexibility.
10:31:11 <beschmi> parsing haskell seems to be harder in elisp, looking at haskell-mode ;)
10:34:58 <beschmi> interresting, seems like whitespace is desugared by the lexer
10:36:34 <JohnMeacham> that is commonly the case in haskell parsers. however, due to what might be considered a mistype in the haskell report, you actually cannot decypher whitespace in the lexer and correctly implement it as given. However, most haskell implementations fudge this and a note was added to the report saying that.
10:37:41 <JohnMeacham> The corner cases where the results would differ basically never come up. you would need an unparenthesised functional type annotation in a pattern guard of a case statement.
10:38:08 <JohnMeacham> There might have been one other... I forget.
10:41:50 <bourbaki> just 5 more days until the hitchhicker is launched :)
10:42:05 <bourbaki> someone needs to add that date in the lambdabot
10:42:11 <bourbaki> @hicker
10:42:12 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- Unknown command.
10:42:17 <JohnMeacham> My towel is poised.
10:42:21 <bourbaki> :)
10:42:40 <bourbaki> i just washed my towel for the movie got my slipers ready and my bathing robe ;)
10:43:29 <bourbaki> i just fear that here it wont be launched on the 29th so ill fly to england :)
10:48:53 <df_> very big mixed review
10:49:10 <bourbaki> for the hicker?
10:49:45 <bourbaki> i guess its not much like the original form what i have seen so far but since adams himself was on the board for the prducers and such i guess its still a fun movie
10:49:47 <df_> the people on the positive side tend to think the book spawned the radio series, or worse, the tv series was first
10:50:46 <bourbaki> the radio series was defenetly first
10:51:00 <df_> adams having an involvment is not a thing that makes it magically good, but i'll say no more and let you decide
10:53:45 <bourbaki> :)
10:54:02 <bourbaki> df_: so you have already seen the film?
10:56:36 <theorbtwo> It went radio, record, book, tv, movie, ignoring the sequels.
11:00:46 <Philippa> much of the second book was in the first series of the radio series, and much of the third was an old Dr Who script...
11:01:47 <bourbaki> :)
11:02:16 <bourbaki> what i particulary liked in the radio play was the british accent
11:02:28 <bourbaki> and i doubt that it will be the same in the new movie
11:14:25 <Lemmih> Hey Si\.
11:15:05 <othernoob> hi, does anyone here use haskell in Fedora Core 3 ?
11:20:50 <Philippa> bourbaki: the film apparently is missing the whole lying-down-in-front-of-bulldozer scene...
11:21:31 <bourbaki> WHAT!?!
11:21:52 <bourbaki> thats one of the coolest ill logic application i have ever seen they cant kick it out
11:22:03 <jesse99> i don't understand how Data.Map.lookup works
11:22:11 <jesse99> it's typed like this: lookup :: (Monad m, Ord k) => k -> Map k a -> m a
11:22:18 <bourbaki> ok but i guess here applies the old "you have got to build bypasses" argument
11:22:30 <jesse99> how can the compiler know what type m is? how do I go about using the function?
11:30:36 <kosmikus> jesse99: the compiler tries to infer the type from the context, i.e., from how you use the result of the function
11:31:52 <jesse99> well presumably lookup will return a value wiith a predefined type so it's not clear to me what the context its used in does
11:31:53 <kosmikus> jesse99: one way to use it is with the Maybe Monad, then the type becomes "(Ord k) => k  -> Map k a -> Maybe a"
11:32:11 <KrispyKringle> othernoob: I use it on Gentoo, fwiw.
11:32:22 <KrispyKringle> Hugs and GHC are both in portage.
11:32:46 <KrispyKringle> Though on the downside, it's called ``portage,'' which always bugged me as sounding too q337.
11:32:51 <KrispyKringle> 1337, even.
11:33:16 <shapr> Doesn't portage really mean carrying a canoe across a chunk of land to the next bit of water?
11:35:29 <KrispyKringle> shapr: yes.
11:35:30 <KrispyKringle> yes it does.
11:35:56 <othernoob> krispy, how do i use ghc in linux ? i used it on win before, but im win-free now
11:35:57 <jesse99> well thanks kosmikus, I dont understand how it works but you can certainly assign the result of lookup to a value of Maybe or List type
11:37:41 <kosmikus> jesse99: it works because the Monad class has the methods "return" and "fail"
11:38:02 <kosmikus> jesse99: these are the only two methods that lookup makes use of
11:38:35 <KrispyKringle> othernoob: you just type "ghc" at the command line :)
11:38:52 <jesse99> yeah, but isnt there something else going on? some compiler magic that allows the compiler to convert a monad to another monad type?
11:39:02 <kosmikus> jesse99: no
11:39:31 <jesse99> type4 unifation across the = operatior then?
11:39:39 <kosmikus> jesse99: no conversion; the compiler figures out at which type you use it, and then there's a fixed monad that's used
11:41:01 <othernoob> KrispyKringle: okay, it says no input files ?
11:45:18 <jesse99> that's some cool stuff kos
11:49:43 <Lemmih> othernoob: 'ghc SomeHsFile.hs -o binary'
11:49:55 <shapr> --make is also popular.
11:51:11 <KrispyKringle> :246
11:51:13 <KrispyKringle> oops
11:51:23 * shapr notes a possible vim user.
11:52:30 <othernoob> what does that do Lemmih ?
11:53:13 <KrispyKringle> it compiles SomeHsFile.hs into a binary called "binary"
11:53:21 <_JusSx_> wow
11:53:24 <_JusSx_> great
11:53:24 <KrispyKringle> othernoob: what are you trying to do?
11:53:27 <_JusSx_> that's cool
11:53:37 <KrispyKringle> shapr: yeah. wrong terminal
11:54:21 <KrispyKringle> shapr: you're all about emacs?
11:54:31 <shapr> Nah, I'm all about Yi.
11:54:42 <othernoob> well..i have to do some haskell for school. so, i just need a file, which i can use to test stuff. and i need to know how i can create other files
11:54:44 <shapr> I use both emacs and vim on a regular basis.
11:55:04 <_JusSx_> shapr: at the same time?
11:55:14 <shapr> _JusSx_: Sure, why not?
11:55:25 <_JusSx_> for the same file?
11:55:29 <_JusSx_> coooool
11:56:06 <KrispyKringle> shapr: i get confused when i try to switch back and forth
11:56:10 <shapr> When I'm ssh'd into a slow box on a slow connection, tramp has locking issues.
11:56:14 <KrispyKringle> when is witched to vi, i was always hitting emacs keys
11:56:23 <KrispyKringle> now i have trouble always hitting vi keys in other apps
11:56:30 <KrispyKringle> its actually an issue, since osx has native emacs keyb indings
11:56:42 <KrispyKringle> so, using emacs would've been more rational, perhaps.
11:57:02 <musasabi> using the vi emulation mode of emacs is one solution.
11:57:20 <KrispyKringle> not really. my whole point was that if i get used to vi bindings, it hurts me in osx :P
11:57:25 <shapr> musasabi: Hey, want to write something for TMR2?
11:57:32 <KrispyKringle> nextstep apps have osx bindings for, like, end of line, home, etc.
11:57:48 * shapr is pinging authors while setting up TmrWiki
11:57:56 <KrispyKringle> Tmr Wiki?
11:58:04 <shapr> The Monad.Reader
11:58:09 <KrispyKringle> oh, right
11:58:12 <musasabi> shapr: What is the deadline?
11:58:24 <shapr> Well, I hope to have the whole thing online by the first...
11:58:45 <shapr> Though I'm not sure if that's realistic.
12:01:04 * shapr sends out emails
12:01:19 <musasabi> six days..
12:10:12 <Muad_Dibber> pfft, wiki's growing as weed :)
12:15:36 <jlouis> shapr: side question. What wiki software are you using?
12:17:10 <xerox> jlouis, I would speculate moinmoin
12:24:31 <shapr> Yeah, for the moment. Flippi doesn't have enough features yet.
12:24:56 <shapr> But I'd rather use Flippi just for the 'users are the best bugfingers' effect.
12:25:12 <TFK> howdy shapr
12:27:31 <shapr> privet TFK
12:28:00 <TFK> Ma shlomha?
12:28:23 <TFK> (I'll save you the mental torment and explain that it means "how are you?" in Hebrew.)
12:28:40 <TFK> Anyway, I think you're the only one to whom I have not bragged yet about the working status of the pastebin :-)
12:28:52 <shapr> cool :-)
12:28:58 <shapr> Yeah, I guessed that was Hebrew.
12:29:46 <TFK> Yup. So I now decend yet again into the educational docs, to emerge with a lambdabot plugin to augment the pastebin or somesuch.
12:30:29 <shapr> spiffy!
12:30:48 <shapr> Want to write something short about your pastebin experience for The Monad.Reader?
12:31:38 <TFK> Oh boy, not sure what to write.
12:31:42 <TheHunter> TFK, i'm currently working on getting rid of most of lambdabot's monad transformer stack (die, ExceptionErrorT!), which will hopefully pave the way to implementing your module
12:31:57 <TFK> TheHunter, coo :-)

12:33:32 <Oejet> How's the mood in the channel this evening?
12:33:51 <TheHunter> i hope it's correct that ExceptionErrorT's purpose only was get a less unexpected StateT s IO behavior. But that'll be changed to ReaderT (IORef s) IO
12:34:06 <Gahhh> How large has this channel ever gotten ?
12:34:16 <shapr> 152 or so
12:34:33 <shapr> quick invite your friends ;-)
12:34:44 * shapr grins
12:34:44 <Gahhh> there you go
12:34:45 <TheHunter> 152 it is :)
12:34:55 <Oejet> Yay!  #haskell > #java
12:35:19 <TFK> Now let's convert those numbers into applications.
12:35:28 <Oejet> Well, >=.
12:35:49 <Gahhh> applications that non-haskellers can use ?
12:36:24 <shapr> Sounds good to me.
12:36:33 <Oejet> TFK: Nah, let's party.  Let's all change our nicks to lambdabot[n] and play around with whoever joins next.
12:36:47 <TheHunter> thbot, @dynamic-load foo
12:37:03 <Gahhh> heh
12:37:13 <shapr> As soon as I get the TmrWiki up, I'll be actively seeking authors to start adding content.
12:37:39 <Oejet> shapr: Ready to add content, sir.
12:37:40 <shapr> That is, writing articles.
12:37:43 <shapr> yay!
12:38:41 <TFK> Gahhh, user-space apps would rule most :D
12:39:39 * Oejet writes his own version control system.
12:39:52 <shapr> hej Anders_
12:40:12 <Oejet> Nah, just kidding.
12:40:28 <Oejet> Hejsan, Anders_.
12:41:35 <TFK> Oejet, same old, same old.
12:42:14 <TFK> I was pondering about a VoiP client, though. I have no idea how Shtoom is coming along, and are there any other FOSS VoiP programs?
12:43:07 <shapr> gnome-meeting and a few others.
12:43:34 <shapr> Mostly pure H.323 though some are adding SIP support.
12:43:51 <TFK> Are they good?
12:44:07 <shapr> I've never gotten anyone to try them with me.
12:44:14 <bour[sw]> Philippa: who do you know all that about the hicker?
12:45:45 <TFK> So there. Something that is cross-platform, easy on the eye and usable for Joe Average. Just an idea, though, I doubt I'll ever write one.
12:47:49 <TFK> I can also whine about good cross-platform IM clients, particularly ICQ (since that's what I use ;-)

13:10:11 <TheHunter> i have worked out a "denotational semantics" in form of an interpreter (+QC tests) for my reflection thingy, though.
13:16:35 <shapr> So, who's up for writing an article for the experimental wikipublishing issue of The Monad.Reader?
13:16:48 <shapr> dcoutts: I think you said you won't have enough time, is that correct?
13:17:24 * Lemmih considers writing about Cabal-get.

13:21:31 <Lemmih> Anyone got a proper cabalization of HaskellDB?
13:21:40 <xerox> shapr, what's the timeline?
13:22:10 <shapr> xerox: have it ready to publish by the 1st?

13:34:01 <musasabi> How is mayday in Sweden?
13:34:03 <Palle> shapr, Wasn't it hard to learn swedish for you? It's like a war for non-european people to learn danish
13:34:41 <musasabi> (The local university tradition is to hold the whole week before mayday parties and party even more then...)
13:34:48 <shapr> I spent three years trying to learn Finnish. Swedish was like taking a holiday.
13:35:06 <shapr> Min en puhu suomea :-)
13:35:48 <Palle> shapr, Oh finnish is a hell...
13:36:16 <shapr> I think Finnish is a beautiful language, but it's hard for me to learn because it's hard to relate it what I already know.
13:36:36 <musasabi> I have to agree that swedish is actually an easier language, but that does not mean that I would speak it very well.;
13:37:01 <musasabi> Finnish is not related to many languages. Estonian and Hungarish mainly.
13:37:05 <Palle> musasabi, What does finnish people normally speak?
13:37:12 <Palle> oh..
13:37:25 <shapr> On the other hand, I just bought a 1GB digital music player that I hang around my neck, and I'm listening to Swedish books from CD encoded to ogg.
13:37:44 <Palle> cool! :) I should do the same with Russian
13:38:07 <shapr> I've learned a lot of useful language learning tricks that I will be able to apply if I decide to really learn Finnish.
13:38:21 <Palle> shapr, How many do you speak?
13:38:37 <boegel> Palle, not only for non european people, my native language is Dutch, and Danish sounds like Greek to me
13:39:16 <Palle> boegel, But dutch and danish is more related than fx. a slavic language? :(
13:39:17 <Palle> :) even
13:39:27 <musasabi> Palle: Finnish? (or I misunderstood the question) There is a Swedish-speaking minority mainly on the west coast.
13:39:33 <shapr> I'm originally from Alabama, USA and I had French in college. I spent three years working on Finnish, and now two years on Swedish.
13:39:56 <TFK> Alabama? Really?
13:40:14 <shapr> Yup, I'm from the Deep South.
13:40:16 <Palle> musasabi, Okay.. Normally danish people speak 3 languages.. so I guess it was some of the kind in finnland.
13:40:26 <TFK> I'm surprised you're from the US at all ;-)
13:40:33 <shapr> Why?
13:40:35 <Palle> shapr, When will you start learning danish? ;)
13:40:45 <shapr> Probably not right away :-)
13:41:03 <shapr> I can understand spoken danish and norsk somewhat, they're pretty close to Swedish in my opinion.
13:41:05 <Palle> Just seem like you where ussing a topdown tecnique. :)
13:41:06 <musasabi> ah now I understand what you mean.
13:41:19 * boegel would love to learn Chinese and Russian
13:41:26 <TFK> shapr, not sure. Is "Shae" a popular name in the US?
13:41:34 <musasabi> Normally Finnish, Swedish and English. Next come German and French I think, followed by Russian.
13:41:34 <Palle> shapr, Well some dialects we don't understand our self :)
13:41:48 <TFK> Then there's the "ScannedInAvian" thingie ;-)
13:41:58 <Palle> musasabi, Okay.. Russian may be closely related. :)
13:42:14 <shapr> TFK: Not really, it's mostly used for girls, and for some guys of irish origin.
13:42:23 <shapr> TFK: but then, Shae is short for shapr, so...
13:42:28 <TFK> Are you a guy of Irish origin?
13:42:38 <TFK> Shapr is an actual name?
13:42:39 <shapr> No, I changed my name a few years back.
13:42:54 <shapr> I was born Robert Benjamin Gilliam, but I got tired of it.
13:43:03 <Palle> We should all change our names to Haskell. :)
13:43:04 <TFK> ha!
13:43:10 <shapr> So I changed it to Shae Matijs Erisson.
13:43:14 <shapr> My mother was not happy.
13:43:16 <musasabi> Russian is a slavic language and thus not related to any of the others.
13:43:19 <TFK> Palle, like Madonna?
13:43:26 <Palle> shapr, Why not sony ericsson? ;)
13:43:37 <Palle> TFK, Huh?
13:43:40 <Gahhh> Why at all ?
13:43:53 <Palle> musasabi, I know but geographically .. but anyway there is alot of snow in the middle..
13:44:09 <shapr> Palle: :-P
13:44:24 <Palle> shapr, Well it's a good phone, has one by self ;P
13:44:34 <Palle> so not a shame to carry that name :)
13:44:39 <shapr> My last name actually means "Son of Eris"
13:44:51 <NooKe> Night all
13:44:53 <Palle> shapr, I'm son of Simon
13:44:58 <TFK> Who's Eris?
13:44:59 <shapr> NooKe: er, hi?
13:45:04 <TFK> Ben-Shim'on?
13:45:21 <shapr> TFK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris
13:45:25 <shapr> hej ski
13:45:27 * TFK looks
13:45:46 <NooKe> I had a quick question about haskell (Currently sitting and programming), was wondering if someone could help?
13:45:51 <ski> hejhej shapr
13:45:57 <Gahhh> NooKe: go ahead
13:46:08 <shapr> TFK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism
13:46:16 <shapr> ski: want to write an article for TMR?
13:46:31 <musasabi> Swedish has been traditionally force-fed to all finnish students in school and thus some people don't learn it properly (we even have the word pakkoruotsi). Russian is quite good but there are cultural things making the number of people learning it smaller than the need.
13:46:53 <NooKe> I have a string to be manipulated but this string contains different characters (Such as  and so on, I think they are called unicode or whatever) and I keep getting lexical error from GHCi so I was wondergin what can be done?
13:46:58 <Palle> musasabi, aha okay. Like we are beeing teached german in school i see.
13:47:07 <TFK> shapr, wow. You're... flexible :-)
13:47:18 <shapr> What does that mean? :-)
13:47:39 <NooKe> I searched the net for it but couldn't get a concrete answer on what to do and if there is any function on prelude or GHC extended to help me out
13:47:50 <TFK> "Uninhibited", I think that's the term.
13:48:05 <Gahhh> "GHC only accepts the ISO-8859-1 character set at the moment."
13:48:14 <NooKe> :(
13:48:21 <Gahhh> in the source dode, that is
13:48:23 <shapr> I think I can realistically identify with that description.
13:48:24 <Gahhh> err code
13:48:41 <musasabi> NooKe: you might want to escape them in a suitable manner. (ghc makes non-ascii strings transformed into utf8 by some algorithm, and you are probably using iso-8859-*)
13:48:46 * TFK nods
13:49:48 <NooKe> Damn there goes my whole idea down the drain. The thing is I have a program that reads a webpage and this webpage is in chinese and the output is all weird (Like ,) so I only needed a way to simply find a certain text in there
13:49:53 <shapr> Sadly, I have loaned out all my copies of the Principia Discordia, and none of them have come back.
13:51:07 <TFK> That's how it always happens with books, doesn't it?
13:51:10 <NooKe> Basically the text I need in the page is normal characters (Among the weird unicode stuff) but even thought I get lexical error cause ghc doesn't like the string
13:51:53 <shapr> TFK: I dunno, I haven't been able to loan out my category theory books no matter who I offer them to...
13:52:01 <Igloo> NooKe: Are these characters in the Haskell source?
13:52:06 <NooKe> No.
13:52:17 <Igloo> What's the exact error?
13:52:24 <TFK> Heh, I meant with books you actually do get to loan out ;-)
13:52:27 <NooKe> As I said, the program simply gets a webpage source and returns as a string.
13:52:39 <Igloo> And is it while compiling or running it?
13:53:37 <NooKe> But the webpage I need is in chinese so the function is returning a string like ", ()</A>(<B><A HREF="login?a"
13:54:32 <NooKe> I only need to extract some stuff from this string. When I try running on GHCi I get lexical error. That is the problem. I haven't actually tried compiling it yet cause I thought since GHCi gives me error so would GHC, or am I worng?
13:55:58 <NooKe> I simply go through the whole string searching for a pattern in the search function but when I tried to test the search function with such a string on GHCi I got the error
13:56:11 <shapr> I wonder if I can convince ICANN to give me an .edu address for Miskatonic university.
13:56:52 <theorbtwo> shapr: AFAIK .edu is under the same somewhat silly rules as .net -- IE if you can afford it, you can have it.
13:57:29 <shapr> That's good to hear.
13:57:45 <dbremner> shapr - there's this site - http://www.miskatonic.net/
13:57:53 <theorbtwo> I'm having a problem that I suspect is largely me being stupid.  I've got an IO [String] that I need to convert into an IO String in the way that unlines would do, were it not for the monad getting in the way.
13:58:02 <NooKe> Igloo Did you get what I mean?
13:58:38 <pesco> theorbtwo: liftM
13:58:51 <Igloo> NooKe: No
13:59:00 <theorbtwo> @type liftM
13:59:01 <Igloo> You didn't seem to cinlude the exact error or how you caused it
13:59:03 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- bzzt
13:59:11 <NooKe> OK. Let me try again.
13:59:18 <shapr> dbremner: Yeah, but getting a real miskatonic.edu address would be a cute hack.
13:59:47 <ski> is there a real miskatonic uni ?
13:59:48 <pesco> NooKe: I got what you meant. It's only GHCi giving you the trouble because it cannot read the unicode (UTF-8 probably) input.
13:59:50 <Igloo> (by "how you caused it" I mean pretty much "what you typed")
14:00:06 <theorbtwo> If it's having problems reading the input, then the input probably isn't utf8.
14:01:01 <Igloo> GHC IO is all latin-1 isn't it?
14:01:12 <pesco> NooKe: "Inside" the program, a Char can be any unicode character, but GHC can only read Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) encoding.
14:01:20 <NooKe> I have a function that retrieves the source of a webpage into a string. Another function that goes through the string looking for a pattern. Now when I test the search function with GHCi (For debugging purposes) with a string like  it gives me the error (Lexical error)
14:01:21 <theorbtwo> Ah.
14:01:23 <shapr> Greetings jyp, want to write an article for The Monad.Reader?
14:01:25 <theorbtwo> Thanks, pesco.
14:01:29 <shapr> ski: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskatonic_University
14:01:38 <NooKe> Thanks pesco, I think thats the answer I was looking for
14:01:50 <xerox> @index liftM
14:01:51 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- Unknown command.
14:02:04 <theorbtwo> Nobody's implemented it yet, I'm afraid.
14:02:10 * xerox thinks he read "algae" O_o
14:02:26 <theorbtwo> For that matter, I wonder what happened to the real lambdabot.
14:02:32 <shapr> lambdabot: hellooo
14:02:37 <shapr> lambdabot: @quit
14:02:42 * shapr shrugs
14:02:48 <jlouis> deadlock
14:02:51 <jlouis> probably
14:02:58 <xerox> He is in a vegetative (algae) state!
14:03:10 <Palle> Goodevning mr. louis. :)
14:03:13 <NooKe> pesco Is there anyway to write such characters in the source code in a way ghc will understand?
14:03:18 <ski> shapr : ty (ok, wasn't sure however there maybe also was real uni (maybe new))
14:03:23 <xerox> @type Control.Monad.liftM -- anyway

14:03:27 <jlouis> anyway, the @index command was removed because it was too spammy. Suggestions for making it less so appreciated
14:03:49 <shapr> Actually, it was removed because I never got it working without Haddock.
14:03:55 <shapr> @info was removed for spam reasons.
14:03:57 -algaebot(~algaebot@202.22.160.158)- Unknown command.
14:03:57 * xerox wants index back too. Or even some commandline index tool.
14:03:58 <theorbtwo> jlouis: Foo.Bar.A, Foo.Bar.B can be shortened to Foo.Bar.(A|B)
14:04:03 <pesco> NooKe: Please turn off whatever formating your client puts around nick names!
14:04:08 <TFK> Hmmm. You guys know the (a?) textual version of Zendo?
14:04:10 <shapr> xerox: ok, I can do that.
14:04:24 <theorbtwo> The channel is generally in utf8, I think.
14:04:25 <xerox> Great.
14:04:25 <shapr> TFK: I only play with little pyramids.
14:04:28 <shapr> poetix: y0!
14:04:28 <jlouis> theorbtwo: in what context?
14:04:37 <dbremner> shapr - IIRC you have to be a registered educational organization to use .edu.
14:04:43 <NooKe> pesco Sorry. I didnt realise I see something different, might you tell me what does it looks like?
14:04:47 <poetix> shapr: ow!
14:04:56 <TFK> shapr, whatever happened to your wishes of making a PC version of IceHouse?
14:05:04 <theorbtwo> Er, in the output of index?
14:05:17 <jlouis> theorbtwo: ah, of cours
14:05:18 <jlouis> e
14:05:18 <shapr> dbremner: Yes, question is... what counts as a real registered educational organization?
14:05:19 <theorbtwo> Using | instead of , might be clearer.
14:05:29 <Igloo> NooKe: If you mean you're using high bit characters on the GHCi command line then that's the same category as "in the source", so it ought to work when compiled
14:05:45 <shapr> TFK: I got distracted, though I do have some beginning code.
14:06:06 <pesco> NooKe: Bad. Just please turn off whatever it is. (I cannot see what this is _supposed_ to look like.)
14:06:16 <NooKe> Thanks. I'll continue with coding for a while. Thanks a lot for the help guys
14:06:20 <theorbtwo> We just see ?username?
14:06:27 <theorbtwo> Or, leastways, I do.
14:06:28 <NooKe> I'll try fixing it
14:06:32 <TheHunter> i think someone should just hack up a perl script that transforms the library documentation into a haskell file with a map with from function names to modules.
14:06:35 <shapr> I see ?esco?
14:06:48 <tuomov> I see opescoo
14:07:03 <pesco> I see UpescoU whith the U's in inverted color.
14:07:24 <NooKe> Haha. Sorry guys. I am looking here where to turn this off
14:08:25 <shapr> hiya jyasskin, want to write for TMR?
14:08:33 <pesco> NooKe: In Strings, you can put unicode characters with backslash-escape sequences. As in "\x2223" I think. Consult the report.
14:08:34 * shapr picks on everyone
14:09:00 * theorbtwo doesn't want to write for the Reader.
14:09:04 <shapr> aww, why not?
14:09:14 <NooKe> pesco I read something like that on the net. Thanks will try
14:09:16 <theorbtwo> Um, I barely know any Haskell?
14:09:23 <shapr> I think you have valuable insights into the process of learning Haskell.
14:09:35 <poetix> That's what I'm telling myself, too...
14:09:51 <TFK> I'm not sure my insights will pass censorship :-/
14:09:57 <TFK> I am tempted to write, though.
14:10:06 <TFK> I am torn by indicisiveness!
14:10:07 <shapr> Well, it's a peer-reviewed journal, finally.
14:10:23 <TFK> Bah, out go my ID fetish :-/
14:10:24 <shapr> TFK: isn't that not being sure where to cut?
14:10:54 <dbremner> shapr - this page has the rules http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.edu

14:12:28 <NooKe> NooKe Is everybody seeing OK now or is the formatting still bad
14:12:34 <tuomov> still bad
14:12:36 <ski> BAD
14:12:39 <NooKe> Damn
14:12:46 <KrispyKringle> Hmm. This fella othernoob, who was unfamiliar with how to invoke GHC, now wants to know how to create a haskell file and compile it.
14:12:50 <KrispyKringle> I'm not sure what to say.
14:12:55 <TFK> NooKe, I'm seeing circles around your nick, is that the expected behaviour?
14:13:09 <TFK> KrispyKringle, ghc --make myfike.hs :D
14:13:23 <TFK> Ah, create a haskell file.
14:13:23 <NooKe> TFK Yes
14:13:26 <KrispyKringle> TFK: i told him to read a book on haskell :P
14:13:33 <TFK> NooKe, well, I see the circles around my nick now :-)
14:13:39 <TFK> UTF-8 here, if it matters.
14:13:48 <KrispyKringle> What's with the U thing?
14:13:49 <TFK> KrispyKringle, I'm not aware of any online books :-(
14:13:55 <NooKe> TFK Apprently you're the only one
14:13:55 <KrispyKringle> TFK: haskell.org has some.
14:14:02 <TFK> KrispyKringle, *online*?
14:14:16 <KrispyKringle> I see these bold U's around the nicks when NooKe says them.
14:14:29 <TFK> I've heard of dead-tree format, otherwise it's only tutorials (although YAHT looks big)
14:14:33 <NooKe> Yeah it is the formatting which I can't find where to change
14:14:37 <KrispyKringle> TFK: yeah, well, tutorials
14:14:38 <KrispyKringle> books
14:14:40 <KrispyKringle> whatever :P
14:14:41 <TFK> NooKe, I would never give up my UTF-8 :-)
14:15:02 <TFK> KrispyKringle, could've told him to come around 'ese parts.
14:15:11 <KrispyKringle> he WAS here
14:15:15 <KrispyKringle> he left because...i dont know why.
14:15:19 <NooKe> Me
14:15:22 <NooKe> Still here
14:16:11 <TFK> NooKe, you're "othernoob"? :-P
14:16:23 <NooKe> Sorry I got it after I had written already
14:17:31 <dbremner> TFK - there's http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html
14:17:33 <TFK> Oh, you have problems parsing unicode?

14:25:24 <NooKe> Cool.
14:25:42 <NooKe> I am gonna go bacl to coding. Thanks for the help guys. I'll probably be back soon with more problems. :P
14:25:55 <NooKe> AFK
14:26:14 <NooKe> Well Actually AFI (Away from Irc). :P
14:26:43 <TFK> Well, some of us aren't going anywhere :-/
14:28:34 <shapr> TFK: first of the month.
14:29:01 <theorbtwo> A week?
14:29:18 <theorbtwo> And you don't have authors yet?
14:29:46 <TFK> But *which* month? :-P
14:31:48 <dcoutts> shapr, yes I'm not ready for an TMR article yet
14:32:05 <shapr> dcoutts: ok, shall I put you down for the next issue then?
14:32:22 <shapr> The June 1st issue?
14:32:33 <TFK> June :D
14:32:54 <TFK> Ah, that means there'll be an issue in May.
14:33:55 <shapr> theorbtwo: I have seventeen possible articles
14:34:38 <shapr> The first issue had some surprise last minute articles and some surprise last minute 'not gonna happen', but they weren't so surprising, I expected that to happen.
14:34:42 <theorbtwo> But they all need to be written, then peer-reviewed, then the feedback from the reviews incoporated, then re-reviewed, etc... then published.
14:35:16 <shapr> If you use a wiki, that can happen very quickly.
14:35:51 <shapr> First throw your content in there, then peer-review some content someone else has written, then come back tomorrow and see what other people have said about your content.
14:36:05 <shapr> That's the idea at least.
14:36:11 <theorbtwo> Hm.
14:36:27 <theorbtwo> It's certianly an interesting idea.
14:36:46 <shapr> I'll tell you how well it works in six days :-)
14:36:55 * theorbtwo grins.
14:37:53 <shapr> The problem with the first issue (and far worse with the canceled April issue) is that I'm self-employed, I do contract work when I get the chance. When I'm the bottleneck, you never know what's going to happen when.
14:38:22 <TFK> We should be greatful you took it up at all :-)
14:38:37 <TFK> (we are, even)
14:38:53 <shapr> So, taking a page from my advertising copy for my contract work, I figured I'd set up a system that enable the authors to do it themselves.
14:39:10 <shapr> Hopefully that means I'll also have time to be an author for this issue.
14:39:27 <theorbtwo> You make wikis for a living?
14:39:42 * pesco commits to a Definite Article for IssueTwo.
14:39:57 <shapr> I'll do almost anything codey for money, but lately that's mostly been Zope websites.
14:39:58 <Philippa> heh
14:40:21 <Philippa> shapr: I did a little coding on Flippi today but didn't get the chance to test courtesy of a friend showing up five minutes too early...
14:40:28 <Philippa> might be ready for a release soon if I do more tomorrow
14:40:35 <shapr> I have gotten paid to setup wikis and all sorts of other stuff, but I've realized it's easiest if I make software that lets the users build their own website.
14:40:47 <shapr> Philippa: cool, is the latest code in the repo?
14:41:08 <shapr> theorbtwo: What do you get paid to do?
14:41:14 <theorbtwo> Nothing.
14:41:20 <theorbtwo> I'm unemployed.
14:41:30 <shapr> Are you independently wealthy? (Is that the same thing? ;-)
14:42:16 <theorbtwo> No, my girlfriend supports me.
14:42:22 <theorbtwo> (Wave for the crowd, Jess.)
14:42:41 <theorbtwo> Oh, she's not connected.
14:42:49 <dcoutts> shapr, I can probably do June issue (ie deadline will be week before end of May) I'll confirm for certain nearer the date
14:42:56 <TFK> How un-Medieval Ages ;-)
14:43:06 <Gahhh> cheers for the 21st century woman
14:43:13 <shapr> I have tried to convince my fiancee (and boss) to let me put gigolo on my resume, but she refused.
14:43:32 <Lemmih> haha
14:44:24 <Philippa> shapr: the latest is only on my HD so far 'cos I've not tested it
14:44:40 <shapr> Philippa: ah, ok
14:44:44 <shapr> I look forward to it.
14:44:53 <shapr> Especially since I've been hacking on FLM a bit.
14:45:17 <shapr> Philippa: want to write about Flippi for TMR2?
14:46:31 <Philippa> shapr: don't get your hopes up for TMR2, got too much other stuff needs writing
14:46:34 <Philippa> but at some point, yeah
14:46:38 <shapr> Ok, cool.
14:46:40 <Philippa> is wouter still using it as an example?
14:46:47 <shapr> I dunno, I haven't seen him around lately.
14:46:50 <shapr> I'll send him an email.
14:47:31 <shapr> Oh, I should add an explicit license.
14:57:08 * Philippa heads bedwards
14:57:37 <wagle> no 4am for you any more?
14:58:02 <shapr> Hey wagle, want to write for TMR2?
14:59:20 <wagle> shapr: let me think about it...  whens it due?  (TMR3 or 4 seems more likely)
14:59:27 <pesco> cptchaos: Still no v6? I'm disappointed! ;)
14:59:41 <shapr> wagle: C'mon six days is lots of time.
14:59:53 <shapr> Especially with wikipublishing it's lots of time.
15:00:06 * shapr grins evilly
15:00:53 <wagle> shapr: how often you trying to get them out?
15:01:50 <shapr> Once a month.
15:04:18 <shapr> dbremner: So, are you learning Haskell?

15:21:42 <shapr> Ah, ok.
15:22:05 <shapr> If you do you have time, I'd appreciate, especially since I want feedback on this wikipublishing experiment.
15:22:14 <CosmicRay> If I happen to have time, maybe I'll send you something yet  :-)

15:26:21 <blackdog> got it?
15:26:54 <wagle> blackdog: wanna add my nyah?
15:27:13 <shapr> blackdog: got it
15:27:21 <dbremner> shapr - was afk. I started learning Haskell a couple months ago, there are an awful lot of neat ideas.
15:27:33 <shapr> Yeah, I'd say that's the primary export of the Haskell industry.
15:28:09 <shapr> On the downside, other programmers often can't read my Python/Java/JavaScript/etc nowadays.
15:28:40 <dbremner> shapr - I'm the only programmer at work, so no one else can ever read my code.
15:29:58 <shapr> What do you do at work? Geometric and computational aspects of manufacturing processes?
15:30:20 <dbremner> shapr - I work for a managed security services company.
15:30:28 <shapr> Oh, interesting.
15:30:56 <dbremner> shapr - sometimes. There are a lot of opportunities for automation.
15:30:56 * shapr googles to find out what that means.
15:31:15 <shapr> Oh, like counterpane?
15:31:32 <dbremner> shapr - pretty much, only we're a lot cheaper.
15:31:55 <shapr> In that case, I have a particularly neat idea for you. Have you seen QuickCheck yet?
15:32:46 <dbremner> shapr - I've looked at it.
15:32:59 <shapr> I'd like to know what you think about combining QuickCheck and the Haskell TCP/IP stack available in House.
15:33:46 <shapr> Are you familiar with the guys who found the ASN.1 flaw in Oulu, Finland?
15:34:15 <shapr> They used something similar to QuickCheck that's written in Java.
15:34:40 <dbremner> shapr - I've used ASN.1 before and have my own PEN.
15:36:32 <dbremner> shapr - I've heard of House, but haven't looked at the code.
15:37:00 <shapr> Ok, I give up, what does PEN mean in that context?
15:37:11 <shapr> Penetration testing?
15:37:22 <shapr> I haven't used ASN.1 in the last few years (lucky me!).
15:37:25 <dbremner> shapr - private enterprise number. My own branch of the tree.
15:37:33 <shapr> Ah, ok.
15:38:38 <dbremner> shapr - there was a Galois paper about using QuickCheck on an ASN.1 parser they wrote for the NSA.
15:39:11 <shapr> Cool, I heard about that once but never downloaded the paper.
15:39:12 * shapr grabs
15:39:23 * edwinb notes his #haskell tab changing colour
15:39:26 <edwinb> hello world
15:39:40 <edwinb> shapr: I would love to, eventually, but real work has taken over for the moment :(
15:40:07 <dbremner> shapr - QuickCheck seems like a working version of  the statistical testing in Cleanroom Software Engineering
15:40:33 <shapr> edwinb: Shall I put you down for the June issue? or later?
15:40:45 <wagle> i thnk galois has some extensions to quickcheck
15:40:49 <shapr> wagle: oh tell me more!
15:40:55 <edwinb> I'm starting a more fun job at the end of June. I will definitely try then.
15:41:09 <shapr> I've hacked one extension onto QuickCheck, and I've been staring at another.
15:41:15 <shapr> (trying to add unit tests)
15:41:16 <wagle> dunno more than that
15:41:19 <edwinb> Until then, I'm a C++ coder...
15:41:22 * edwinb cries
15:41:29 <shapr> edwinb: Yow, I'm so sorry...
15:41:43 <edwinb> You never know how lucky you are until you have to write C++
15:41:47 <wagle> write a haskell program to write C++ for you
15:42:10 <edwinb> It might even be easier that way. But there are MFC and GUIs involved too.
15:42:14 <dbremner> edwinb - the problem with C++ is that there's so much you have to unlearn later.
15:42:15 <wagle> i've heard that it was possible to write pleasant/fast/clear code in C++
15:42:19 <edwinb> I needed the money ;)
15:42:49 <dbremner> edwinb - http://opensource.adobe.com/ seen this?
15:42:56 <wagle> you just ogtta find the right subset of c++
15:43:07 <wagle> s/ogtta/gotta/
15:43:16 <shapr> autrijus: Hey, think you'll have something pugsy for TMR2?
15:43:16 <edwinb> wagle: Undoubtedly.
15:43:39 <edwinb> Nobody agrees on what the right subset is...
15:44:06 <edwinb> dbremner: Haven't seen it; my browser if failing to cope with it though...
15:44:40 <wagle> the main guy for llvm (which is written in c++) swears that (his subset of) C++ is nice for compiler stuff
15:44:48 <edwinb> Euw
15:45:11 <edwinb> I'm not sure I'd use anything but haskell for compiler stuff, but maybe I say that because I'm used to it...
15:45:37 <wagle> i hold that gcc is empirical proof that you cant write compilers in C
15:45:59 <edwinb> It's clearly possible... I just wouldn't choose to do it myself...
15:46:10 <edwinb> Oh, "can't", I see ;)
15:46:18 <tuomov> the right subset of C++ is C + subtyping
15:46:33 <shapr> I actually wrote recursive descent parsers in Python and Java before I tried Haskell.
15:46:37 <shapr> But never again =)
15:46:52 <edwinb> I've found myself trying to implement algebraic data types by hand as usual.
15:46:59 <edwinb> Still, only two months to go...
15:47:13 <shapr> I have real trouble convincing people that ADTs are worthwhile in Python.
15:47:43 <edwinb> I find if I explain what you can do with ADTs to people they like the idea.
15:48:13 <wagle> why would ADT's not be worthwhile in python?
15:48:36 <edwinb> You can do the same thing in more lines of code with classes and inheritance ;)
15:48:47 <shapr> I think because I haven't succeeded in explaining them.
15:48:49 <edwinb> You look more productive that way...
15:49:27 <musasabi> grah. Even explaining why the ablity to use things like "a list of pairs of A and B" can be hard to explain.
15:50:07 <dbremner> edwin - I think some of that is explained by Paul Graham's Blub paradox. Lisp advocacy aside, the idea is reasonable.
15:50:14 <edwinb> I find explaining something simple like binary trees is useful.
15:50:26 <shapr> There was a long discussion on the pragmatic programmer's mailing list about problems with tree shaped inheritance. I chimed in with what was imho a simple and elegant typeclass implementation. It was very much shorter at least. I also asked someone with a clue about multimethods to show a demo. Nobody responded.
15:50:56 <musasabi> CLOS multimethods are nice. Until someone has to understand things.
15:51:13 <wagle> blub paradox?
15:51:30 <edwinb> Paul Graham writes interesting stuff. Even if I rarely agree with him.
15:51:31 <shapr> My opinion of the pragprog list went down a bit, I was the only one to suggest something other than tree-shaped inheritance.
15:51:40 <dbremner> wagle - http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BlubParadox
15:52:27 <wagle> i need a wiki search box in my browser..
15:53:07 <edwinb> Oh yes, I was going to ask if a EuroHaskell 2005 is likely...
15:53:20 <dbremner> shapr - I found parametric polymorphism much easier to understand than inheritance.
15:53:42 <edwinb> I tend to find inheritance is overrated if you have ADTs...
15:53:44 <shapr> edwinb: At this moment, I'm thinking not.
15:54:04 <shapr> At least, not with me organizing it.
15:55:42 <edwinb> Oh, okay. I was just wondereing if I should make plans to try to get there, as I'd have to work it out fairly soon... so I'll assume not...
15:55:43 <musasabi> Eurohaskell would be very nice...
15:55:50 <musasabi> but now sleep.
15:55:59 <shapr> yeah, me too.
15:56:00 <wagle> how do ADT's (even attempt to) provide re-use?
16:05:20 <wagle> awww
16:07:45 <ski> by making abstract interfaces to various different concepts and interfaces, so that one can reuse code that uses the ADT while changing the ADT, maybe ?
16:10:09 <wagle> if the code being copied has a bug, how do you fix it?
16:10:42 <ski> which code ?
16:11:17 <ski> the one that used that ADT ?
16:11:19 <wagle> sounded like you were suggesting that you reuse the ADT by copying the code, and then changing the copy
16:11:26 <ski> nono
16:13:45 <shrimpx> if you rewrite the adt internals you don't have to rewrite all the code that uses it. i think that's the strongest concept of "reuse" that adt's provide
16:14:00 <shrimpx> it's more like interface reuse than code reuse...
16:14:12 <ski> i was thinking of a) changing the underlying implementation of some ADT used to another one (but still program should "have same effect", normally not requiring same time taken etc ..), b) changing the ADT impl to another one that gives the program a different behaviour (but same interface is still used)
16:14:20 <wagle> the code that the oo inheritence claims to facilitate the reuse of is the component code, not the glue code (ie, that strings components together)
16:15:03 <wagle> though reuse of the glue [?] code is worth considering
16:15:16 <ski> so i guess i was thinking of the reuse of one's own code when using an ADT (i.e. one doesn't have to change many things in that code). but maybe you're after something else with 'reuse' ?
16:15:25 <shrimpx> yea, inheritance reuse is different
16:15:39 <wagle> 15:54 < edwinb> I tend to find inheritance is overrated if you have ADTs...
16:15:54 <wagle> (its 16:16 now)
16:16:01 <shrimpx> shrug
16:16:05 <wagle> hahah
16:16:26 <shrimpx> when you inherit, you literally reuse a bunch of code. you get all that functionality by writing 0 lines of code
16:16:53 <shrimpx> same with deriving
16:17:17 <wagle> oh.. like "deriving Show"?
16:17:21 <shrimpx> ya
16:17:48 <wagle> i had the impression that deriving sortof generated code
16:18:06 <ski> you normally get functionality that is based on the code that is inherited (because normally one (re)defines hooks that the previous code calls)
16:18:45 <ski> deriving is another thing, imo
16:18:54 <ski> yep
16:19:41 <ski> while inheritance (in various forms) plugs in new code into internals of existing code
16:21:50 <wagle> i'm realizing that i really havent used "deep" inheritance
16:22:11 <ski> by which you mean ?
16:22:17 <wagle> (i define default handlers, and maybe override them with inheritance
16:22:42 <wagle> i have never piled on more than one layer of overriding with inheritance
16:22:45 <shrimpx> ski: so what do you mean by "hooks that previous code calls" ?
16:23:42 <wagle> of course, i was thinking of inheritance mostly as subtyping, and my subtype tree was pretty shallow
16:25:15 <ski> shrimpx : (sorry for vague wording) in e.g. Java, you define or override some method that will be called by other code
16:29:27 <ski> shrimpx : should i try to explain better or you get what i'm after ?
16:32:18 <shrimpx> ski: no that was clear thanks

16:36:00 <basti_> shapr: a) whats the wiki doing? b) i now know how to decently do key bindings in Yi, at least in principle
16:36:01 * wagle hugs TheHunter 
16:36:05 <shapr> How'd you do it? Did you just dump out the dictionaries?
16:36:14 <shapr> basti_: oh tell me more!
16:36:21 <shapr> basti_: did you get my email?
16:36:26 <basti_> uh
16:36:31 <basti_> yes.
16:36:38 <shapr> beschmi: Want to write about darcs patch theory for TMR2?
16:36:44 <TheHunter> a used a small hackish script to convert the library documentation into a file that can be read with a mapSerializer.
16:36:48 <basti_> now i did.
16:37:10 <shapr> TheHunter: did you load the .haddock files? or convert from the html?
16:37:12 <basti_> i will upload my article tomorrow
16:37:20 <TheHunter> html.
16:37:20 <shapr> basti_: spiffy!
16:37:43 <beschmi> shapr: i don't think i can grok it for TMR2, TMR3 perhaps ;)
16:37:47 <basti_> its at the 95% mark anyway, i'd say.
16:37:55 <shapr> beschmi: Awright, I'll put you on the list for tmr3
16:38:04 <TheHunter> it's of course highly dependent on the way the html files are formatted...
16:38:08 <basti_> cool to see tmr grow like this
16:38:21 * shapr agrees
16:39:00 <shapr> TheHunter: Want to write for TMR2?
16:39:28 <shapr> basti_: tell me about keybindings, did you figure out a way to do nested maps of map/key?
16:39:31 <TheHunter> honestly, i don't think i can make it.
16:39:40 <basti_> hmm i got all the bits together now
16:39:43 <basti_> i think
16:39:47 <wagle> shapr: have you considered how articles would be cited (including 10 years from now)?
16:40:05 <shapr> Yes. I decided I'll worry about it if there's a third issue.
16:40:05 <basti_> a) the mode itself will coincide with the lexer mode
16:40:30 <shapr> wagle: If there is a third issue, and the project hasn't fizzled out, I'll apply for an ISBN number.
16:40:43 <basti_> b) keybindings will of course need some state, but there's IORef for that, and i think i can knit it in.
16:40:45 <shapr> Or whatever that number is that publications get.
16:41:37 <basti_> c) there will be tables for each "submode" (as in, normal editing, C-x mode, M-x mode etc.)
16:41:43 <wagle> the librarians at CMU (for something else needing publisher info (location, date, ertc)
16:41:47 <basti_> with a binding for each key of course
16:41:51 <shapr> I've been looking at the syntax highlighting demo code that dons wrote. I think there's already a Happy parser for Haskell, so that can maybe be directly plugged in.
16:42:10 <wagle> the librarians at CMU (for something else) ...
16:42:21 <shapr> wagle: Yes, I've been considering claiming .aq as location.
16:42:34 <wagle> whats .aq?
16:42:45 <shapr> Antarctica
16:42:50 <wagle> hahah
16:42:54 <shrimpx> antarctiqa

16:43:21 <wagle> well, librarians are interested in permanent storage and indexability of info
16:43:24 <basti_> upon "User Preferences"
16:43:35 <basti_> ah
16:43:38 <shapr> Sounds like you hit login instead of create.
16:43:41 <basti_> yes.
16:43:49 <basti_> that might have been the problem.
16:43:53 <basti_> (habitual enter presser)
16:44:05 <basti_> oh yes great.
16:44:31 <shapr> wagle: I'm interested in producing text and/or code from which people can learn. Other considerations will be assuaged later.
16:44:39 <basti_> server time is incorrect
16:44:52 <shapr> whoa, it's *way* off
16:44:58 <wagle> if i write something for TMR, i might want to refer to it years later, or have others refer to it
16:45:19 <shapr> Yes, ibid already mentioned this.
16:46:05 <shapr> ibid even said that many academics won't consider publishing unless the periodical has an official number, because many academics pay rate is based directly on their publications.
16:46:10 <wagle> ibid == "as wagle already said sometime in the future"?  8)
16:46:31 <shapr> About referncing.
16:46:35 <shapr> referencing.
16:47:11 <wagle> i still have delusions of getting my phd
16:47:12 * basti_ never knows how many of shaprs ears are listening to whom.
16:47:17 <shapr> basti_: huh?
16:47:29 <basti_> ah nothing
16:47:30 <basti_> :)
16:47:42 <shapr> You mean, where do I hear all this stuff? :-)
16:47:48 <basti_> ah no...
16:48:01 <basti_> i mean the way you manage to talk to 2 people at once for example :)
16:48:09 <basti_> not that i never do that myself.
16:48:40 <shapr> I can talk to quite a few people at the same time.
16:48:42 <wagle> just like playing 20 simultaneous games of chess
16:48:45 <basti_> -g-
16:48:47 <shapr> on several different channels too.
16:49:16 <basti_> oh, today i gave the "that annoying IO thing" talk again
16:49:17 <dbremner> shapr - a friend is currently interviewing at the .pro registrar
16:49:20 <shapr> But my whole family did that when I was growing up.
16:49:41 <basti_> is it genetics then, or environment? :)
16:49:57 <shapr> Even better, with my family there's at least five conversations going on, even on a pretty quiet day.
16:50:21 <basti_> well if that is impressive depends on the number of members in your family
16:50:33 <basti_> if you have 10 siblings that would count as normal.
16:50:45 <shapr> Listeners are expected to connect the sentence with the conversation, even if two successive sentences are for two different conversations.
16:51:16 <shapr> It's considered cute if you can make a single sentence work for three or more conversations at the same time.
16:51:21 <dbremner> shapr - have you read any of Deborah Tannen's books on conversation styles?
16:51:32 <shapr> No, but I shall immediately ask Google.
16:51:46 <shapr> basti_: I have three siblings.
16:51:59 <basti_> mmh
16:52:01 <basti_> :)
16:52:17 <wagle> shapr: each people needs to speak in a different lnguage..  8)
16:52:30 <wagle> s/people/person/
16:52:39 <shapr> Sadly, I can only do that when I'm around my fiancee and my Irish friend at the same time.
16:53:05 <shapr> My fiancee speaks six languages, I've got about two, and Tony has about two.
16:53:24 <wagle> Tony?
16:53:29 <shapr> My Irish friend.
16:53:51 <wagle> ah..  whats his other language?  (irish?)
16:53:58 <shapr> dbremner: Thanks for this reference, this is directly relevant to some research I've been doing!
16:54:03 <shapr> Oh, German.
16:54:09 <shapr> He speaks Gaelic, but none of the rest of us do.
16:54:28 <wagle> i learned a little irish once...
16:54:31 <shapr> He also speaks Dutch, I forgot about that.
16:54:32 <basti_> as long as it's not basque...
16:54:38 <dbremner> shapr - np. I'd start with "That's Not What I Meant."
16:54:42 <shapr> I'd like to try Basque.
16:54:59 <basti_> "with philosophers its the same as with basques - people say they would understand each other"
16:55:04 <shapr> dbremner: Yes, I'm reading about that one already.
16:55:12 <dbremner> shapr - I found a Basque tutorial on the net years ago.
16:55:19 <basti_> basque is interesting because its an isolate
16:55:51 <basti_> its not a visible relative to latin or greek or any other language spoken in europe
16:55:59 <shapr> dbremner: Are you familiar with Robert Anton Wilson's E-Prime?
16:56:22 <wagle> what IS basque similar to?
16:56:25 <dbremner> shapr - yes. I've been trying to speak it for about a month now. It tends to irk my coworkers.
16:56:27 <basti_> nothing?!
16:56:34 <dbremner> wagle - Hungarian and Finnish, IIRC.
16:56:47 <basti_> uhm
16:56:55 <shapr> dbremner: I find it to be a powerful tool.
16:57:38 <shapr> dbremner: I think you'll fit right in here on #haskell :-)
16:57:54 <dbremner> shapr - It seems like Heinlein's Speedtalk for mortals.
16:57:58 <shapr> heh!
16:58:12 <shapr> Tried loglan/lojban?
16:58:21 <dbremner> shapr - I tried to create a Speedtalk in HS.
16:58:27 <wagle> what language does E-Prime tout?
16:59:07 <shapr> I did crypto in high school. (bad crypto)
16:59:16 <dbremner> shapr - the rift between the two versions sort of turned me off.
16:59:48 <wagle> i'm amazed that peple still know about loglan.. everything went out of print or something years ago when i was about to try learning it
17:00:01 <shapr> imho it's worth learning lojban just to get the experience of using it.
17:00:34 <shapr> Much like e-prime forces you to be aware of identity, lojban forces awareness of some other facets of communication.
17:01:08 <shapr> I think that changing my name was part of my exploration of communication/expression.
17:01:40 <basti_> are you your name?
17:01:48 <shapr> That is the question to be explored.
17:01:59 <shapr> I have discovered that to some degree, I am.
17:02:08 <basti_> hobby philosophy? :)
17:02:30 <d`> basti_ isn't it every thinking person's hobby ?;]
17:02:38 <shapr> I'm just exploring the world around me, like I always do. No difference between type theory and changing my name there.
17:03:00 <basti_> d`: i see differences between interesting thoughts and philosophy
17:03:10 <shapr> What's the difference?
17:03:22 <basti_> philosophy is about writing big books without contents.
17:03:27 <shapr> And is that difference classified as interesting thought or philosophy? ;-)
17:03:34 <basti_> thats the impression i got while watching philosophers, at least.
17:03:38 <d`> basti_ i define philosophy as constructive thinking about some basic ideas
17:03:50 <basti_> then you did not read any philosophical works.
17:03:51 <basti_> :)
17:04:01 <basti_> i was in a philosophy lecture once.
17:04:08 <d`> 1) i did 2) i define what it means, not anyone else
17:04:12 <shrimpx> mental masturbation
17:04:18 <shapr> I've read some philosophy, I really enjoyed it.
17:04:30 <basti_> depends strongly on the philosopher
17:04:36 <basti_> descartes? great.
17:04:43 <d`> shrimpx better to do that mentally ;]
17:04:44 <basti_> kant? if you like it...
17:05:00 <basti_> but then have a look at contemporary, everyday philosophers
17:05:02 <shrimpx> kant was awesome, he just couldn't write
17:05:23 <basti_> big books without content
17:05:33 <basti_> and their students are even worse
17:05:33 <shapr> Who counts as contemporary?
17:05:46 <basti_> well the guys at your university, for example.
17:05:50 <basti_> i mean not anyone can be great
17:05:54 <shapr> I'm not at a uni :-)
17:06:00 <basti_> but they could at least try not to make things worse
17:06:00 <basti_> oh
17:06:03 <d`> basti_ "every man is a star" ;]
17:06:12 <shapr> Haven't been at a uni in nearly ten years.
17:06:18 <basti_> i see.
17:06:21 <d`> basti_ we all have the gods spark, only not everyone makes use of their potential ;]
17:06:40 <shapr> I'm a self-employed, self-taught, self-assured contract programmer!
17:06:58 <shapr> Some people just start fires with their sparks.
17:07:05 <d`> aye
17:07:06 * shapr flames the nearest target
17:07:14 <basti_> oh and some people seem to not have anything sparking
17:07:18 <shapr> Yeah.
17:07:31 <shapr> I've realized that I relate to people by their passion.
17:07:40 <d`> basti_ most people in fact ;] but it _is_ inside them ;]
17:07:42 <basti_> many of those philosophy guys at our university being of this kind, i think.
17:07:43 <shapr> I have a lot of trouble dealing with people who do not have any passion that I can detect.
17:07:54 <TheHunter> wow, string memory consumption is really sad.
17:08:06 <shrimpx> passion is key
17:08:27 <basti_> anyone read "Zen and the art of Motorbike Maintanance"?
17:08:34 <dbremner> shapr - that's why I rejected a recent applicant to work.
17:08:50 <basti_> passion = quality = tao etc.
17:08:56 <d`> well creativity is IMO a more general value
17:09:10 <d`> people who are passionate are creative anyway
17:09:29 <shrimpx> passion implies many values
17:09:43 <basti_> basically you're talking about quality i think.
17:09:43 <basti_> :)
17:09:56 <basti_> people doing quality work = passionate
17:10:00 <d`> but quality is a subjective term
17:10:06 <basti_> its not.
17:10:08 <d`> while creativity is more objective
17:10:21 <basti_> its not, too.
17:10:21 <basti_> ;)
17:10:21 <d`> (if anything can be called objective anyway)
17:10:21 <basti_> :P
17:10:59 <wagle> a math prof i once worked for asked me several years ago what i was doing these day.  i must has said something like "anything but computer science".  he asked why's that?  i spouted passionately at length why not.  he ned something like "oh, computer science IS your fild!"
17:10:59 * basti_ will go to bed with a naked girl now :)
17:10:59 <shapr> dbremner: not enough passion?
17:11:02 <Cale> everything can be called objective :)
17:11:04 <shapr> yow!
17:11:06 <basti_> cu
17:11:11 <d`> basti_ be sure to inflate her
17:11:14 <d`> sweet dreams
17:11:14 <d`> ;]
17:11:15 <shapr> ouch
17:11:16 <Cale> It just doesn't mean much :)
17:11:33 <dbremner> shapr - not enough passion, and also responded to a lot of questions with "I don't know."
17:11:39 <wagle> s/fild/field/
17:11:45 <shapr> dbremner: Someone on Ward's Wiki called it Zealot Oriented Programming. I rather like that approach.
17:11:54 <wagle> s/ned/sed/
17:12:05 <shapr> wagle: That's totally quotable.
17:12:10 <wagle> (stupid 1 second keypress echoes)
17:13:09 <wagle> jeez..  the typos are worse than usual..  8(
17:13:14 <dbremner> shapr - http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html I've found this inspirational.
17:13:59 <shapr> wagle: I cleaned up the quote.
17:14:28 <wagle> hmm.. i have a tendency to attempt to speak in e-prime like fashion..  most people find it stultifying
17:15:13 <shapr> I think the clearest need of E-Prime is "X sucks"
17:15:20 <shapr> or "X is shit"
17:15:36 <wagle> haha
17:16:01 <shapr> All that says is that "I am angry/resentful because X exists." It usually implies that that person had to use X and did not enjoy the experience.
17:16:05 <wagle> or "you cant write compilers in C"?
17:16:57 <shapr> It's often useful to know whether someone did or did not enjoy X, but only if they say why.
17:18:15 <dbremner> shapr - the Dale Carnegie yes, yes, yes, approach is one way to get those questions answered.
17:19:35 <shapr> Dale is definitely worth reading.
17:19:41 <wagle> intuitionistic?
17:20:18 <dbremner> shapr - that particular approach can be considered manipulative and if the other person detects it, they tend to resent it.
17:21:09 <shapr> Yeah, been there, done that.
17:21:14 * mwc shakes fist at god
17:21:30 <mwc> shapr, heh
17:21:32 <ski> wagle : ?
17:21:47 <mwc> got a bloody cramp in the knee of my good leg
17:21:52 <mwc> I can't get up off the floor
17:22:01 <shapr> Are you irc'ing from the floor?
17:22:07 <mwc> Yep
17:22:12 * shapr thinks about that.
17:22:16 <ski> you're typing on keyboard on the floor ?
17:22:23 <ski> m
17:22:26 <mwc> No, I have the notebook down on the floor
17:22:38 <wagle> intuitionistic logic denies existance proofs..  must actually construct the object, not just proof that it exists
17:22:39 <shapr> Well, there's a good use case for a notebook computer.
17:22:50 <shapr> Foo, it's getting light outside.
17:22:52 <ski> mwc : you have one bad leg too ?
17:23:20 <shapr> dbremner: This is an excellent article, thanks for the pointer. You wouldn't happen to have a website/blog/braindump of other stuff somewhere would you?
17:23:22 <ski> shapr : already ?
17:23:28 <mwc> ski, I have one broken leg
17:23:50 <shapr> ski: Yeah, I can see the red lines of sunset out of my window.
17:23:51 <mwc> although just a few days until I get Dr's permission to start walking
17:23:59 <shapr> er, sunrise
17:24:00 <shapr> doh
17:24:02 <ski> mwc : ok (sorry if this query disturbed you)
17:24:16 <mwc> shapr, I thought sunset happened at like 11:55 PM?
17:24:23 <mwc> and then sunrise was about 10 minutes later
17:24:30 <mwc> ski, no problem
17:24:40 <wagle> i kget cramps if am dehydrated or low on electrolytes
17:24:42 <mwc> http://www.mattcox.ca/images/recovery2_1.png There's the current hardware
17:24:54 <shapr> If you look at xsunclock you'll see it slowly increases as the earth's tilt changes.
17:24:55 <mwc> I got the staples out weeks ago
17:25:05 <dbremner> shapr - I don't have a blog but I've been considering starting one.
17:25:07 <dons> lambdabot: @version
17:25:12 <shapr> Right now sunrise appears to be 2:30am.
17:25:22 <TheHunter> dons, lambdabot is dead.
17:25:31 <shapr> dbremner: I'd definitely read it if you mention this sort of stuff.

17:25:41 <dons> yeah, but still appears in /names
17:25:41 <wagle> does ghc 6.4 ever finish compiling?  (been over 2 hours now)
17:26:08 <shapr> dbremner: My blog is passable - http://www.scannedinavian.com/
17:26:27 <TheHunter> i think it's my fault, i introduced the bug when i did persistence, and yesterdays patch sharpened it.
17:26:33 * mwc installed Wordpress months ago and hasn't done squat since
17:26:52 <dons> TheHunter, really?
17:27:07 <dons> I was just assuming network issues.
17:27:34 <TheHunter> dons, i think so, though i'm not sure.
17:27:55 <dons> ok.
17:27:59 <dons> \bot: @version

17:28:09 <TheHunter> more importantly, it doesn't matter because i changed the code today.
17:28:13 <wagle> shapr: how close are you to the arctic circle?
17:28:18 <TheHunter> no ExceptionErrorT any more :)
17:28:23 <dons> TheHunter, applying now.
17:28:31 <dbremner> shapr - looks like dbremner.com is available, I'll look into it.
17:28:31 <mwc> wagle, if he goes up 10 stories, he can just see it
17:28:53 <wagle> hahah
17:28:56 <mwc> it goes -_-_-_-
17:28:58 <shapr> wagle: forty miles south.
17:29:07 <mwc> something like an atlas
17:29:13 <shapr> mwc: It actually does that in Rovaniemi. Just for tourists.
17:29:15 <dons> yay. die ExceptionError
17:29:32 <dons> shapr, hs-plugins is in darcs now. at the usual location
17:29:33 <mwc> shapr, haha, like the line through the greenwich observatory

17:29:54 <shapr> dons: What do you think about a TMR2 article? Enough time? Nowhere close?
17:30:04 <dbremner> shapr - have you looked at APL?
17:30:15 <dons> oh, I don't think I'll get the time. i'm writing two papers simultaneously atm.
17:30:18 <shapr> No, I haven't
17:30:19 <dons> :/
17:30:23 <shapr> Ah, too bad.
17:30:27 <shapr> Shall I put you down for TMR3?
17:30:33 <dons> yes. I think so.
17:30:36 <shapr> spiffy
17:30:50 <wagle> shapr: which city you in?
17:30:51 <shapr> dbremner: I've read about it, but never actually used it.
17:31:15 <shapr> wagle: Add yourself! http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellUserLocations
17:31:25 <dons> removing levels of redirection is really good, TheHunter. Cheers!
17:31:28 <dbremner> shapr - Iverson's book A Programming Language makes interesting reading. I'm just looking over your May 20th blog entry.
17:31:38 <TheHunter> dons, as for haddock, i didn't document it, but you need to run scripts/GenHaddock.hs.
17:31:43 <shapr> In fact, you can update the image too :-) I'm not very happy with the version I made.
17:31:55 <dons> ok. i'll check it out.
17:32:27 <shapr> dbremner: may 20th 2004?
17:32:51 <dbremner> shapr - structures for thinking.
17:34:23 <shapr> Ah yes.
17:34:58 <wagle> hmm..  i gotta hook up my gps...
17:35:53 <shapr> wagle: Google for nearby hotels, they often have long/lat on their website.
17:36:26 <shapr> dbremner: Actually, structures for thinking has since turned into a neat sci-fi novel I've started.
17:36:41 <shapr> I decided to take that just a few steps further...
17:36:45 <wagle> thats no fun..  and that way you dont get the history on me moving around..  8)
17:36:50 <dbremner> wagle - there's terraserver.
17:37:39 <dons> TheHunter, is this right?:     moduleCmds      _ = return ["@index"]
17:39:13 <TheHunter> hmm, not really, but it apperantly works...
17:40:30 <dons> TheHunter, did you ever feel like hacking on yi? ... ;)
17:41:12 <dons> also, regarding lambdabot, what would you like to get done before we release v3
17:42:49 <CosmicRay> shapr: you told me of two haskell blog packages recently, but I forgot the names... do you still remember?
17:42:56 <TheHunter> i don't know if i should have a look yi. Actually, i shouldn't even be hacking on lambdabot...
17:43:11 <shapr> CosmicRay: PLog and BloB
17:43:25 <shapr> I'm using PLog, Bjrn Bringert wrote BloB
17:43:26 <CosmicRay> danke
17:44:13 <shapr> I can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about both of them, but really I'd like something better :-)
17:44:19 <TheHunter> on my personal todo list is providing the infrastructure for @paste.
17:44:30 <dons> TheHunter, ok. :} maybe when I add some more cool things to Yi, you'll get tempted..
17:44:39 <shapr> BloB is great, but hard to setup, PLog is easy to setup but difficult to modify.
17:44:43 <TheHunter> dons, yes i fear that.
17:44:59 <shapr> TheHunter: there's the easy solution....
17:45:09 <shapr> Hack lambdabot into Yi as an IRC client.
17:45:21 <CosmicRay> shapr: have I shown you this yet?  http://changelog.complete.org/node/287
17:45:48 <dons> shapr, yeah. I was dreaming about a plugin infrastructure for Yi last night...
17:46:10 <dbremner> CosmicRay - http://mike.malaprop.org/pictures.php?picture=323
17:46:11 <shapr> I've been dreaming about the syntax highlighting.
17:46:23 <dons> and there's actually a fair bit of code starting to drift between yi and lambdabot
17:46:24 <CosmicRay> dbremner: hah!
17:46:49 <dons> I spent 2 days hacking @reboot into lambdabot, but didn't quite get there.
17:46:59 <shapr> dbremner: wow
17:46:59 <dons> it still wanted to close the socket for some reason.
17:47:17 <dons> but :reboot in yi got cleaned up as a result.
17:47:37 <dons> shapr, yeah. I'm getting excited about yi again, so hopefully we'll see some syn hl progress.

17:50:19 <dons> hehe
17:50:39 <CosmicRay> shapr: I googled for plog but found something written in php
17:50:41 <CosmicRay> do you have a url
17:51:02 <TheHunter> i'm still not sure if there should be an IRC and an LB monad and how the relationship between them is.
17:51:07 <TheHunter> s/is/should be/
17:51:22 <wagle> LB?
17:51:28 <dons> yeah. that's  a bit of a dark area still
17:51:54 <dons> also, the Module class stuff should not live in IRC.hs.
17:52:07 <TheHunter> i think as much state as possible should go into modules.
17:52:12 <wagle> whats LB?
17:52:42 <TheHunter> probably means LambdaBot. It's the monad which keeps lambdabots global state.
17:52:51 <CosmicRay> shapr: are you aware of workaround for the spin-on-conflict problem in darcs?
17:52:54 <wagle> ah
17:52:55 <dons> where sensible.
17:52:59 <TheHunter> the IRC monad is LB + connection to the IRC server.
17:53:19 <dons> but the state is fairly small: a couple of threads, a couple of channels.
17:54:03 <dons> the network socket should also be there if I ever want @reboot to work.
17:54:11 <dons> oh, and then there's the RW state. that's bigger.
17:54:30 <TheHunter> yes, the IRCRState is fine.
17:54:42 <dons> less state is definitely welcome. feel free to work on this.
17:56:02 <dons> and the LB/IRC stuff is a bit over engineered, perhaps.
17:56:13 <TheHunter> there are some design decisions. For example, I'm temped to introduce lBtoIRC :: IRC a -> LB a -> LB a
17:56:35 <wagle> hmm..  the hawiki server's clock is off
17:57:23 <TheHunter> you think we should merge IRC and LB ?
17:57:52 <dons> well, if it's sensible to do so.
17:58:30 <dons> I'd like all the global state to live in a single value.
17:58:44 <dons> (@reboot would be a lot easier)
17:58:49 <TheHunter> i'm not sure. It's nice to be able to express "this function can't assume a connection to an IRC server".
17:58:58 <dons> yes. that's true.
17:59:39 <dons> how much code relies on this distinction?
18:00:17 <TheHunter> not so much. IRC is basically LB + ircPrivMsg
18:00:51 <TheHunter> and modules might need to check if there's a connection.
18:01:23 <TheHunter> for @seen, i introduced moduleDynInit as a workaround to that problem.
18:01:48 <dons> ah. I see.
18:01:57 <dons>     -- This magically causes the 353 callback to be invoked :)
18:03:04 <dons> I think i'd probably be happy with just cleaning up the code in IRC, not necessarily getting rid of the LB/IRC monads just yet
18:03:20 <TheHunter> this was funny, too. I actually expected to have to connect a callback listening to the answer of /names, but it turned out, just sending /names was enough. No idea why.
18:06:11 <TheHunter> what would @reboot keep?
18:06:35 <TheHunter> the whole IRC module, or would it magically reload that too?
18:06:49 <dons> all code would be reloaded.
18:06:52 <shapr> poo
18:06:57 <shapr> I was about to give him the url.
18:07:05 <dons> write back to main()
18:07:13 <shrimpx> shapr: hamming's talk was a good read. thanks
18:07:18 <TheHunter> that sounds cool.
18:07:20 * shapr points to dbremner 
18:07:21 * shrimpx goes off to do great work
18:07:26 <dons> yeah, that's how yi works now.
18:07:29 <shapr> He gave the url, not me.
18:07:33 <shrimpx> oh
18:07:38 <shrimpx> sorry. dbremner: thanks
18:07:39 <shapr> Though now that you mention it, I'll put it on my blog and give dbremner credit.
18:07:48 <dons> you get hold of the global state, and pass it to reboot :: a -> IO ()
18:08:02 <dons> which reloads all the dynamic code, and re-injects the global state
18:08:17 <dons> in lambdabot's case, this would mean keeping the socket open
18:08:34 <shapr> I've recently thought of a bizarre way to turn the downsides of personal firearms into advantages that should allow armor piercing rounds to be standard.
18:08:39 <shapr> But I'd rather write code...
18:09:00 <dons> then we jump back to runIrc, but instead of building the state from scratch, we restore it from the state passed in.
18:09:30 <dons> the problems at the moment seem to be stopping threads (though yi does this without troubles), and maintaining the network connection.
18:09:42 <dons> i'll have to think more about it, and clean up runIrc (it's pretty messy)
18:10:03 <dons> luckily, we can use the persistence stuff to not have to worry about module state
18:11:01 <TheHunter> that sounds good.
18:11:29 <wagle> shapr: where might a hotel list its lat/long?
18:11:32 <TheHunter> anyway, i gotta go to bed.
18:14:05 <shapr> wagle: google for your town name and the words latitude longitude
18:16:40 <wagle> yeah..  just with this lag, everything is EXTREMELY SLOW AND PAINFUL..  sigh
18:25:18 <wagle> as far as i can t4ell, i've added myself to the map, but i dont show up

18:28:44 <\bot> bzzt
18:33:24 <wagle> the map image on http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellUserLocations doesnt show my location..  whats the deal?  8)
18:49:26 <wagle> oic..  i need to kick shapr into generating anothe .png filwe
18:49:29 <wagle> file
18:58:46 <KrispyKringle> maybe its on cron or something
19:00:08 <wagle> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/haskellers.png
19:01:06 <KrispyKringle> woh
19:01:11 <KrispyKringle> why not just generate it yourself? :P
19:01:12 <dons> oh, that's updated a bit from last week.
19:02:04 <wagle> darwinports has xearth, but i've been stuck for the past 4-5 horus waiting for it to finish compiling ghc
19:02:12 <dons> need to zoom in a bit - i doubt we'll have many antarctic denizens
19:02:56 <wagle> i thought shapr was planning to publish TMR from antartica
19:03:19 <dons> oh!
19:03:58 <wagle> besides, i'm on the far left edge of that map..  8/
19:04:26 <dons> so we could change the right edit to be around the date line
19:04:31 <dons> s/edit/edge/
19:06:40 <dons> @help index
19:06:41 <\bot>  @index - yay!
19:06:44 <dons> hehe
19:08:10 <wagle> how far am i if ghc6.1 is cc1'ing Text/ParserCombinators/Parsec?
19:08:25 <wagle> ghc 6.4, rather
19:08:37 <dons> getting there.
19:09:44 <wagle> half done?
19:11:05 <dons> well, that's in base/
19:11:17 <dons> so there's still the other libraries to go.
19:11:40 <dons> oh, no. could be parsec/
19:11:46 <dons> then there's not much to go at all.
19:12:11 <dons> yeah. it's not in base/ :}
19:15:38 <wagle> four hours so far on a 1GHz G4
19:30:26 <wagle> what is the network library?
19:36:51 <wagle> (just that it was generating zillions of little .o files..  8/)
19:37:52 <wagle> i'm starved and cant go home until this is done..  so, its like watching a teapot: never boils
19:46:14 * Lemmih yarns.
19:46:54 * wagle twines
19:47:10 <Lemmih> After hours of boring HTML hacking I finally got the HTML interface for Hackage working.
19:47:16 <wagle> ...  well at least i'm being forced to learn the build structure..  8)
19:47:24 <wagle> .. of ghc
19:47:36 <wagle> Lemmih: cool
19:54:02 <wagle> ghc is HUGE
19:54:24 <dons> how big?
19:54:34 <wagle> 5 hours and i think i'm only half done compiling
19:54:42 <dons> this is very unusual
19:54:49 <dons> I wonder what is going on..
19:55:11 <Gahhh> cpu/ram = ?
19:55:35 <wagle> powerbook, 1GHz G4, 1G RAM
19:55:50 <wagle> the disk isnt terribly fast, i suppose
19:57:07 <wagle> hmm..  doesnt look disk bound
19:57:08 <shrimpx> wagle: yea i remember a standard build taking forever
19:57:16 <shrimpx> maybe not 5 hours
19:57:41 <shrimpx> i have a 1.25GHz 1G ram
19:58:04 <wagle> right now, its doing libraries/OpenGL
19:58:32 <wagle> still has hslib and docs
19:58:48 <wagle> hslibs looks big
19:59:31 <wagle> shrimpx: notebook or desktop?
19:59:42 <shrimpx> powerbook
20:00:32 <wagle> looks cpu bound, but half system
20:05:56 <dons> I wish autoconf did type checking
20:06:36 <wagle> see my unwritten treatise: "Autoconf considered harmful"
20:07:14 <ozone> i saw an awesome shirt at linux.conf.au
20:07:23 <ozone> "i love free software, but i HATE AUTOCONF"
20:08:32 <ozone> http://www.cafepress.com/cp/browse/Ntt-autoconf_pp-_N-0_pv-leuksman.7112875_No-1_Ntk-All_D-autoconf_Nao-1
20:09:36 <dons> I don't mind autoconf, except for the fact that it's stupid and ugly
20:10:53 <ozone> and it sucks
20:11:05 <ozone> not to mention, gay
20:11:09 <ozone> (with apologies to all the gays)
20:11:12 <ozone> anyway, -> lunch
20:11:21 <wagle> i especially enjoy that it silently makes bogus decisions that you notice hours later
20:11:39 <dons> yeah. that's a really nice thing
20:12:52 <dons> the guy who though that a sh script compiler would make a nice configuration system was nuts.
20:13:16 <wagle> my main section is titled "failure is not negation!"
20:14:28 <wagle> if you want to test if the -foo option exists, you first try the command without the -foo option, then with.  if the former fails, THEN YOU ABORT
20:15:07 <wagle> sorry, having flashbacks
20:15:16 <dons> hehe
20:15:17 <shrimpx> 2 kinds of _: ones that everyone complains about, and ones that no one uses
20:18:08 <wagle> wow.  haskell source sure is a impressive compression encodiing..  1.6M is now 56M and growing
20:18:26 <wagle> (1.6M source, 56M source and binaries)
20:19:24 <dons> hmm. that's really huge.
20:19:33 <Lemmih> We should save music as Haskore sources.
20:19:35 <dons> I wonder what's going on. 20M is more usual for ghc at least.
20:20:14 <wagle> debug mode or something?
20:20:48 <wagle> i'm using darwinports
20:21:16 <wagle> libraries/OpenGL is now 78M
20:22:50 <wagle> hmm..  actually its growing and shrinking
20:23:02 <wagle> dropped to 67M, then is growing again
20:23:17 * wagle continues to watch the wildlife
20:23:52 <wagle> 91M
20:23:58 <wagle> woo
20:28:10 <wagle> ohhh..
20:28:26 <wagle> its creating jillions of these things:
20:28:27 <wagle> OpenGL//Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL/GL/VertexSpec_split/VertexSpec__8.p_o
20:28:27 <wagle> OpenGL//Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL/GL/VertexSpec_split/VertexSpec__80.o
20:28:27 <wagle> OpenGL//Graphics/Rendering/OpenGL/GL/VertexSpec_split/VertexSpec__80.p_o
20:28:30 <wagle> ...
20:28:46 <dons> split objs!
20:28:59 <wagle> what are those?
20:30:24 <dons> objects are split up into pieces so that less code has to be linked into static binaries, resulting in smaller binaries
20:32:15 <dons> is this in-memory usage, or disk?
20:32:23 <wagle> disk
20:36:15 <wagle> 123M
20:36:22 * wagle punts and goes home
20:45:23 <dons> hehe. got you!
