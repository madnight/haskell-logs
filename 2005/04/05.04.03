00:27:27 <Sonarman> Itkovian: i haven't been able to get ghc-6.4 working on my gentoo ppc, but 6.2.2 is fine
00:41:32 <xkb> I just installed cabal.. how do I use hackage?
01:12:21 * shapr hops cheerfully
01:13:14 * esap cheers hopfully.
01:36:24 <dons> @version
01:36:25 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- lambdabot 2p99, GHC 6.4 (OpenBSD i386)
01:36:25 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
01:36:30 <dons> hehe. patch count!
01:36:35 <shapr> neato
01:36:41 <xerox> 'morning!
01:36:56 <dons> shapr, we already had a lambdabot2 release, right?
01:37:07 <shapr> er, yeah.
01:37:13 <shapr> time for lambdabot3?
01:37:29 <dons> I guess  that's where we're heading.
01:38:07 <dons> btw , synhl code is in Yi.
01:38:18 <shapr> yeah, I noticed, it's cool!
01:38:18 <dons> it builds, not complete yet. but thhe sketch is there
01:38:59 <shapr> I'm hacking on pugs right now, but I'll play with the synhl after I've finished this bit of want()
01:39:38 <dons> sure. it's not rendering yet, as it's not hooked in. and the api could change. but have a look if you want.
01:40:21 <shapr> Is there some way to do Happy code dynamically? or preview the results?
01:40:40 <dons> ??
01:41:00 <shapr> First thing I'd want for synhl would be the ability to edit the Lexer/Parser in one buffer and see the results immediately applied to sources in another buffer.
01:41:07 <dons> ah ha!
01:41:21 <shapr> That would let you define modes quickly.
01:41:25 <dons> combinator parsers would make that a lot easier.
01:41:51 <shapr> emacs has re-builder that does that, where you see the matches change color as you edit the regexp.
01:41:52 <dons> but wouldn't be too hard to hook it up so that happy gets rerun prior to re-making the syn pluginn
01:42:01 <dons> wow
01:42:03 <dons> that's cool.
01:42:09 <shapr> Yeah, and would look great in Yi!
01:43:02 <Khisanth> anyone know who builds ghc-bin for gentoo?
01:43:20 <shapr> Last I heard, kosmikus.
01:44:08 <wilx> lambdabot, @help
01:44:09 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)-  @help <command> - ask for help for <command>
01:44:15 <wilx> Cool.
01:52:59 <musasabi> Khisanth: I have working ghc from ebuilds.
01:54:25 <musasabi> Khisanth: building ghc from source (not ebuild) will probably not work as gentoo gcc uses stack protector etc by dafault which mess things up (and the ebuild turns them off).
01:56:20 <Khisanth> musasabi: how do the build time compare to mozilla?
01:58:05 <musasabi> Khisanth: shorter I think, but usually I just leave a larger build niced overnight - so I don't have any timings.
01:58:54 <Khisanth> hmm would be ok if it's shorter, takes around 2.5hours for mozilla
03:03:10 <xkb> Is there any manual to build hackage
03:03:12 <xkb> ?
03:03:53 <Oejet> Isn't lazy typing a kind of dynamic typing?
03:04:40 <xkb> hmm what is lazy typing?
03:10:04 <Oejet> xkb: Lazy typing is like lazy evaluation.  The typechecking is pusponed until it is necessary.  So first when an expression is evaluated it is typechecked.
03:10:04 <Itkovian> bd_, I can get nor 6.2, 6.2.2, 6.4 to compile. I've got 5.04-bin atm :-(
03:10:22 <xkb> sounds nice
03:11:39 <Oejet> So:  x = if True then 4 else "foo" has type Int because when evaluated the first time, x will get type Int.
03:12:14 <xkb> aha..
03:12:23 <xkb> are there any working implementations?
03:12:45 <Oejet> Nope, I got the idea just now.
03:13:04 <xkb> eh :)
03:15:36 <Oejet> Maybe lazy typing is just strong dynamic typing, depending on the definition of strong typing.
03:38:24 <metaperl> I'm getting type errors here:
03:38:25 <metaperl> fmax f n
03:38:25 <metaperl>   | n == 0 = f 0
03:38:25 <metaperl>   | otherwise = max( (fmax f (n-1)) (f n) )

03:38:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- max :: forall a. (Ord a) => a -> a -> a
03:39:21 <Cale> you're giving max only one parameter -- perhaps you don't want those parens?
03:39:33 <metaperl> I am?
03:39:40 <metaperl> I think I am giving it 2:
03:39:44 <Cale> ( (fmax f (n-1)) (f n) )
03:39:49 <Cale> is what you're giving it
03:39:53 <metaperl> (fmax f (n-1))
03:39:56 <metaperl> is one
03:40:02 <metaperl> (f n)
03:40:04 <metaperl> is two
03:40:16 <Cale> then you don't want the outer parens
03:40:39 <metaperl> why not?
03:40:40 <Cale> because that will be read as "apply the function (fmax f (n-1)) to (f n)"
03:40:45 <metaperl> I am just encapsulating it
03:41:16 <metaperl> oh, I was trying to force order of evaluation
03:41:23 <Cale> hm?
03:41:28 <metaperl> or encapsulate actually
03:41:37 <Cale> I'm not sure I know what you mean
03:41:40 <metaperl> I was trying to say call fmax with args f and (n-1)
03:42:05 <mflux> metaperl, and max with..
03:42:06 <Cale> (fmax f (n-1))
03:42:15 <Cale> that works
03:42:43 <metaperl> that is the difference between what you typed and what I had?
03:42:52 <mflux> @plugs eval max (1 2)

03:43:13 <Cale>    | otherwise = max (fmax f (n-1)) (f n)

03:43:19 <metaperl> oh I am thinking c-style
03:43:22 <metaperl> perl-style
03:45:02 <metaperl> ok Cale and mflux. Thanks!
03:45:07 <metaperl> it works

03:57:04 <Cale> yes, but you will spam the channel a it
03:57:06 <Cale> bit*
03:57:19 <shapr> oh
03:57:26 <Cale> (only 10 lines or so)
03:57:58 <Oejet> So it cuts the output?
03:58:04 <Cale> yeah
03:58:41 <Oejet> And it also cuts the computation?
03:58:49 <Cale> yep, after 3 seconds
03:59:08 <Cale> and there's no IO
03:59:19 <Oejet> Nice.
04:00:08 <Oejet> How is that implemented, no IO.  What is the backend?
04:01:20 <Cale> ghc and hs-plugins, presumably
04:01:38 <Cale> but I'm not sure exactly what disallows the IO
04:02:08 <dons> the expression is inserted into a larger decl with a Show constraint. Show isn't defined for IOOO.
04:02:56 <dons> resource = let { v = show (your expr) } in v
04:03:15 <dons> resource :: String
04:03:31 <Oejet> Nice and simple.
04:04:06 <Oejet> How is the time cut?
04:04:30 <dons> really simply: setResourceLimit ResourceCPUTime (ResourceLimits rlimit rlimit)
04:04:35 <dons> rlimit = ResourceLimit 3
04:04:43 <dons> the OS chops it off after 3 seconds.

04:06:41 <shapr> I've heard that Cokers are faster than bicycles, but I've never tried it myself.
04:06:43 <duncan_> faster than the tourists but not faster than the locals
04:06:56 <shapr> Ah, I see.
04:07:06 <duncan_> I can keep up with most of my friends so long as they don't hern it

04:07:53 <shapr> Coker sounds so tempting.

04:08:13 <shapr> Yeah, good idea. I'm hungry too.
04:09:21 <Oejet> dons: That seems like a five line program modulo IRC protocol.  Is it a plugin for lambdabot?
04:09:33 <Oejet> Doh, I guess it is.
04:09:46 <dons> yep. it is 36 lines in total.
04:10:00 <dons> requries hs-plugins to do all the fancy work though.
04:10:25 <metaperl> Thompon is a great writer. He not only did a good job of explaining primitive recursion but has a ton of exercise problems to increase your confidence with it
04:10:58 <metaperl> s/Thompon/Simon Thompson
04:12:20 <Oejet> metaperl: What is primitive recursion?
04:13:05 <metaperl> it's just the pattern of having a base case for a function when n = 0 and describing what to do in the nth case when you have f (n-1)
04:13:20 <shapr> yup
04:13:33 <shapr> I think the guys on extremeperl didn't understand when you said that.
04:13:39 <shapr> Actually, I'm sure they didn't
04:14:18 <shapr> They misinterpreted you statement to mean that because you're using Haskell, you don't need software tests.
04:14:55 <metaperl> Oejet, here is the best example I could find: http://www.cs.ecu.edu/~karl/astarte/funSeq/RecursionPRL.html
04:15:12 <shapr> But I think you really meant that inductive definitions are so clear and understandable that it's rare to have bugs in the definition.
04:15:35 <metaperl> I was just talking about functions in general
04:15:47 <metaperl> functions along with type signatures
04:16:43 <Oejet> metaperl: Ah, I was just confused by the word "primitive".
04:17:28 <metaperl> Oejet, this is a certain form of recursion
04:17:34 <metaperl> that goes by the name primitive
04:18:01 <metaperl> in fact, JVR uses the term primitive recursive functions when discussing his language Dynamo, which is written in Haskell
04:19:05 <metaperl> http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/dynamo/

04:19:31 <shapr> Have you seen StarLog too?

04:21:08 <shapr> wilx: scan gives a list of all the intermediate results in a fold as well as the result.

05:01:31 <dons> I'll do that soon.
05:01:44 <dons> it currently accesses a few external tools, like ghc for one
05:02:48 <ozone> are ghc command-line options turing-complete yet?
05:03:02 <dons> also, for the uses @plugs is put to, mutable refs seem excessive.
05:03:08 <dons> ozone: oh boy.
05:04:08 <Heffalump> isn't ST guaranteed to be safe, that being the point?
05:04:49 <dons> if it's safe, and can't get  turned into an IO somehow, then I have no problem. I'll have to look at the code
05:05:49 <dons> I prefer to stay on the safe side though - STRefs seem excessive for the uses @plugs is put to.
05:05:50 <Heffalump> make sure unsafeIOtoST can't be run
05:05:57 <dons> yes.
05:06:00 <Heffalump> true

05:07:37 <musasabi> the same solution can be used for unsafeIOto{ST,STM}
05:08:06 <dons> the solution has been not to allow anything remotely dangerous into scope through control of import lists.

05:29:05 <Itkovian> I simply can't seem to get ghc > 5.04 installed on gentoo ppc
05:29:07 <Itkovian> :-(
05:29:13 <vegai> ah, right
05:29:24 <vegai> sounds like you need to file a bugreport
05:29:31 <Itkovian> yeah ...
05:29:32 <vegai> and in the meantime, install it by hand
05:29:33 <Itkovian> prolly.
05:29:42 <Itkovian> fetching 6.4 right now
05:30:33 <Itkovian> I'd rather emerge it decently :-(
05:36:44 <shapr> shapr's rule of language discussion - As a programming language discussion lengthens, the probability of claims of equality on grounds of turing completeness approaches one.
05:37:22 <musasabi> at least that is easy to bash.
05:38:10 <hellish> possibly dumb question: how do I build a package from a darcs repo that has no ./configure?
05:38:12 <vegai> Basic is equal to Haskell!
05:38:42 <shapr> musasabi: you mean, claims of equality via turing completeness are easy to bash?
05:38:54 <vegai> hellish: which package? Perhaps just make, perhaps autoconf&&./configure
05:39:21 <shapr> I usually autoreconf, does that do the same thing? Or should I use autoconf the first time?
05:39:44 <hellish> vegai, yi. the README references a ./configure, so I tried running autoconf, but the resulting script failed
05:39:44 <dons> you should use autoconf if the script requires autoconf ;)
05:39:51 <dons> autoreconf!
05:39:53 <vegai> autoreconf doesn't update what isn't needed, so it sohuld be ok
05:40:04 <vegai> ...right?
05:40:20 <dons> hellish: I thought yi was distributed with a ./configure . hmm.
05:40:30 <shapr> not in the darcs repo?
05:40:37 <hellish> dons, the tarball is, but darcs isn't
05:40:49 * hellish wonders why autoreconf worked and autoconf failed
05:40:58 <vegai> heh
05:41:00 <dons> because autoreconf is entirely different.
05:41:07 <ozone> do not try to understand the land of autotools
05:41:09 <shapr> Anyway, I'm sure someone else came up with that rule of programming language discussion long before me.
05:41:19 <ozone> shapr: you know wadler's law too, i presume?
05:41:27 <vegai> ozone: ...for the they are subtle and quick to anger
05:41:38 <dons> I'm using autoreconf to generate a config.h from the configure script, rather than writing my own.
05:41:51 <dons> nothing to magic - it just requires autoreconf is all.
05:41:54 <dons> too
05:41:55 <shapr> ozone: haha - http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/curry/listarchive/0017.html
05:41:59 <shapr> that's funny!
05:42:11 <musasabi> shapr: yes.
05:42:36 <shapr> musasabi: can you think of a tactful way to bash such claims in a manner that the claimant ends up with a clue?
05:42:53 <ozone> shapr: refer them to paul graham's essay
05:43:00 <shapr> Which one? Blub Paradox?
05:43:22 <ozone> let's see ...
05:43:51 <ozone> http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html
05:44:00 <ozone> the bits on the "powers" of programming languages
05:44:07 <ozone> probably has some nice quotable bits
05:44:30 <shapr> Oh hey, interesting.
05:46:16 <shapr> I haven't read this essay before, but I've had a lot of these same ideas!
05:46:35 <shapr> I realized that monads just kick the shit of of OOP, and it took me a long time to realize why.
05:47:19 <shapr> I think it's because OOP is pretty arbitrary, and monads aren't about programming as much as they are about the theory of relationships between stuff in math.
05:47:41 <shapr> From that essay - "So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not obsolete is that it was not technology but math, and math doesn't get stale."
05:48:21 <shapr> Seems to me that the more you boil down a language into the really good parts, the more you end up with a bunch of math, and the less you end up with arbitrary structure.
05:50:41 <shapr> ozone: excellent choice, thanks.
05:50:58 <ozone> shure
05:51:57 <Heffalump> me thinks shapr is on crack again comparing monads and OOP
05:52:13 <shapr> They're pretty close actually.
05:52:19 <Heffalump> rubbish.
05:52:26 <shapr> They really are.
05:52:38 <Heffalump> rubbish, and again I say, rubbish. :-)p
05:53:11 <shapr> But objects are structured like separate rings, and monads are structured a necklace that's a single flexible line.
05:56:38 <araujo> Good morning.
05:56:42 <shapr> hiya
05:57:08 <Philippa> it makes a silly amount of sense treating continuations of computations as objects, at least
06:03:42 <musasabi> Is there a better way to express "concat [[(x,y),(y,x),(toLower x,y),(toLower y,x)] | x <- ['A','C'] | y <- ['T','G']]"
06:04:24 <musasabi> that is a list comprehensions where one wants to produce multiple results for one element.
06:04:54 <TheHunter> do x <- [...]; y <- [...]; [(x,y),(y,x),...] ?
06:06:45 <musasabi> nice :-)
06:06:53 <musasabi> I didn't think of using the do notation.
06:07:19 <Lemmih> Shouldn't it be: (x,y) <- zip [...] [...] ?
06:08:00 <TheHunter> oh, sure, i didn't realize it was a parallel list comp.
06:09:20 <shapr> musasabi: doesn't that leave out ('a','t') and ('a','T') ? Are you doing DNA pattern matching or something?
06:10:07 <Heffalump> philippa: objects with or without mutable state?
06:10:24 <Heffalump> and for me, objects have multiple client-chosen entry points
06:10:29 <Heffalump> it's not obvious how continuations have that
06:10:32 <musasabi> shapr: yes.
06:11:09 <musasabi> zip does not seem to help.
06:11:46 <musasabi> wait, it does.
06:11:48 <Lemmih> @plugs do { (x,y) <- zip [1..3] [3..6]; [x,y,x*2,y*2] }

06:12:46 <xerox> Hmpf what was that common pattern..
06:15:26 <beschmi> hi
06:25:21 <shapr> musasabi: what about sequence ["AaCc","TtGg"] ?
06:34:54 <shapr> whoa, nifty "<interactive>: ./RRegex/PCRE.o: unknown symbol `pcre_version'"
06:36:41 <TheHunter> ap is nice, too: ap (liftM2 (***) [id,toLower] [id,toLower]) . ap [id,snd &&& fst] $ zip "AC" "TG"
06:37:34 <shapr> ah, I've been trying &&&
06:37:49 <shapr> For the same purpose.
06:41:23 * TheHunter wonders how worthwile "swap = snd &&& fst", "dup = id &&& id" and both f = "f *** f" would be for Control.Monad
06:41:32 <shapr> I'd sure like it.
06:41:55 <shapr> But I'd use them in Control.Arrow
06:42:17 <TheHunter> well, yes, Control.Arrow.
06:42:27 <shapr> Both is sort of there in &&&
06:42:40 <shapr> But I've wanted swap and dup often.
06:42:43 <TheHunter> i guess if i type "Control" the ".Monad" just comes out automatically.
06:43:00 <shapr> heh, I understand. I can't type the word "sharp" without careful concentration.
06:43:25 <TheHunter> hehe.
07:07:07 * basti_ doesnt understand why Coq is not popular
07:07:46 <Oejet> basti_: Who is Coq?
07:08:12 <basti_> Coq is an interactive system for formal proof.
07:08:59 <Oejet> basti_: You just said the two no-go words; interactive and formal proof.
07:09:15 <basti_> awww.
07:09:46 * basti_ makes his own one. Together with tetraeder.
07:11:06 <xerox> Do you find Arrow functions' types unreadable?
07:11:18 <shapr> No?
07:11:34 <shapr> xerox: they remind me of circuits.
07:11:47 <xerox> shapr: what does the "abc" mean?
07:12:13 <xerox> I mean, I understand what an arrow do only by reading the implementation, I can't guess it from the type
07:12:31 <shapr> xerox: You know that "run" is a verb, right? But you can make it into a noun by saying "I had a run." Similarly "I had a chat" even though chat was originally a verb.
07:12:50 <xerox> Yes.
07:12:51 <shapr> One way of looking at arrows is that they noun a verb, where the verb is a function.
07:13:05 <xerox> So "a"s are functions?
07:13:28 <shapr> "a"s are arrows that represent functions of type (b -> c) in this case.
07:13:32 <TheHunter> @type snd Control.Arrow.&&& snd
07:13:41 <xerox> I can understand, I think.
07:13:54 <shapr> Be aware that my explanation is simplistic, incomplete, and can be misleading.
07:14:02 <shapr> Functions are not the only arrow instances.
07:14:04 <xerox> so  a b c  is  a :: (b -> c)  ?
07:14:28 <shapr> Sort of. It's like another step in the 'functions as values' idea.
07:14:33 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- snd Control.Arrow.&&& snd :: forall a b. (a, b) -> (b, b)
07:14:44 <shapr> arrows of functions are first class transformations.
07:15:16 <TheHunter> @type arr snd Control.Arrow.&&& arr fst
07:15:33 <shapr> That gives you some neat properties that allow stuff like 'automatic optimization'.
07:15:34 <xerox> shapr: "arrows of functions" ?
07:15:38 <xerox> Hmm..
07:15:46 <shapr> Right, functions have an arrow instance.
07:15:57 <xerox> instance Monad m => Arrow (Kleisli m)
07:15:58 <shapr> But arrows themselves are a superset of functions.
07:16:08 <TheHunter> is lambdabot under a dos attack?
07:16:22 <TheHunter> @eval 1
07:16:25 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- bzzt
07:16:27 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- 1
07:16:28 <shapr> There are arrows that are not functions, see Ross Paterson's FoP chapter for more explanation.
07:16:57 <shapr> But TheHunter and I are using the function instance of arrows for cute wiring tricks.
07:17:24 <xerox> I can understand some of the Control.Arrow operators
07:17:24 <shapr> The simplest is to use (Control.Arrow.>>>) as flip (.)
07:17:34 <TheHunter> @type arr snd Control.Arrow.&&& arr fst
07:17:51 <TheHunter> @type Control.Arrow.arr snd Control.Arrow.&&& Control.Arrow.arr fst
07:17:59 <TheHunter> that's it.
07:18:13 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- bzzt
07:18:25 <shapr> I guess lambdabot wants a lot of parens.

07:18:33 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- b) (b, a)
07:19:00 <TheHunter> latest versions of ghc even allow you to write: ... :: Arrow (~>) => (a,b) ~> (b,a).
07:19:00 <xerox> shapr: hmm, I should read something, can you point me?
07:19:11 <xerox> ~>  how cute.
07:19:30 <TheHunter> xerox, do you see what a function of that type does?
07:20:05 <xerox> It seems it's swapping a tuple.
07:20:12 <TheHunter> right.
07:20:21 <xerox> But what about ~> ?
07:20:28 <TheHunter> actually, that's a bad example because it's simple arr (\(x,y) -> (y,x))
07:20:39 <shapr> xerox: http://www.haskell.org/arrows/
07:20:46 <TheHunter> ~> is an infix `a'
07:21:11 <xerox> shapr: nice!
07:21:25 <xerox> TheHunter: is there a similar definition for -> ?
07:21:54 <TheHunter> xerox, (~>) is only defined in this type signature.
07:21:56 <shapr> Do you have a more complex example of ~> ?
07:22:11 <TheHunter> it's the same as Arrow ar => ar (a,b) (b,a)
07:22:21 <xerox> I see!
07:22:31 <xerox> That's very very very nice.
07:22:48 <xerox> @type Control.Arrow.&&&

07:24:10 <TheHunter> actually, (&&&) :: Arrow (~>) => (b ~> c) -> (b ~> c') -> (b ~> (c,c'))
07:24:39 <shapr> Oh that looks nice.
07:24:41 <xerox> Right
07:24:52 <shapr> Who came up with that?
07:25:18 <shapr> I wish I had an RSS feed for arrows developments.
07:25:32 <xerox> I want one too.
07:26:00 <TheHunter> there was an exception before somewhere in the docs that explicitely disallowed such a thing.
07:26:47 <TheHunter> http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2005-March/008104.html
07:27:40 <shapr> nifty
07:28:13 <TheHunter> but i wonder where i can put fixity declarations for that thing
07:29:24 <TheHunter> wow, even (&&&) :: Arrow (~>) => b ~> c -> b ~> c' -> b ~> (c,c') is accepted.
07:29:43 <basti_> btw. how is an arrow expressed in CT?
07:29:49 <shapr> Makes sense. ~> is a cute symbol for an arrow, right?
07:30:01 <basti_> yes it is.
07:30:43 <shapr> The papers discuss the category theory behind arrows. So far, I don't think I've understood it enough to discuss it.
07:31:06 <basti_> oh my.
07:31:11 * basti_ swallows
07:31:22 <shapr> But I think it's like monads, they look really simple the first time you see them, because they are simple! And arrows are the same, they're really simple, and so is the CT behind them, but understand all of the implications is difficult.
07:31:58 <TheHunter> no, the categorical interpretation of arrows is neither straigtforward nor simple.
07:32:04 <shapr> Oh, ok then.
07:32:21 <shapr> <-- CT clueless
07:33:19 <basti_> aww.
07:33:23 <basti_> i feared it
07:33:37 <ozone> TheHunter: oh, that's pretty neat! (~>)
07:37:57 <shapr> hiya isomer_
07:38:54 <isomer> hi shapr
07:38:56 <isomer> how goes?
07:39:04 <shapr> Life is good, code is fun. How goes with you?
07:39:24 <isomer> same here. coding away...
07:39:34 <isomer> playing lots of pool and doing lots of swimming
07:39:45 <shapr> What are you coding these days?
07:39:50 <shapr> Squeak?
07:40:03 <isomer> visualworks -- i'm writing a webapp with seaside
07:40:28 <shapr> I've heard of seaside, haven't looked at it. My Smalltalk skills are eponymous.
07:40:38 * shapr loves that joke
07:40:43 <isomer> hehe
07:41:05 <Itkovian> just to let you know ... Tom Boonen has won the Tour of Flanders
07:41:07 <isomer> it's a neat web framework based on continuations to maintain session state
07:41:07 <Itkovian> :-)
07:41:16 <shapr> Who's Tom Boonen?
07:41:27 <Itkovian> one of our finest cyclists
07:41:32 <shapr> isomer: Yeah, I've heard about it. I'm very interested in continuation-based web frameworks.
07:41:41 <isomer> it's quite nice
07:41:43 <Itkovian> rejoice.
07:41:46 <Itkovian> lol
07:41:51 * shapr rejoices
07:42:17 <isomer> it also gives you an event model. so you can, for example, say "when the user presses this button, send me this event"
07:42:31 <isomer> much better than having to decode the response etc
07:43:22 <shapr> Yeah, Zope's method as url does something vaguely like that.
07:44:28 <shapr> I've been looking at webapp abstractions lately, I have a list around here somewhere.
07:44:58 <isomer> i've tried so hard with zope... it's just....so friggin complicated :(
07:45:44 <shapr> Yeah, it is.
07:52:17 <basti_> time for haskell? ;)
07:54:57 * jlouis hacks more lambdabot
07:55:10 <jlouis> soon, the quotemodule is being reorganised into something pretty
07:55:50 <shapr> yay!
07:56:00 <shapr> It's about time someone cleaned up that code!
07:56:08 <shapr> (but hopefully not the author)
07:59:47 <Lunar^> http://research.sun.com/techrep/2005/abstract-143.html
08:00:01 <Lunar^> that's not hardware STG, but still
08:00:46 <shapr> Hey! That's the non-cache-coherent NUMA I was talking about!
08:01:07 <Lunar^> shapr: when?
08:01:23 <shapr> I dunno, a few months ago.
08:01:57 <shapr> It's a pretty obvious idea, I'm sure several people thought of it at the same time.
08:02:02 <Lunar^> yep
08:04:48 <bourbaki> moin
08:05:12 <basti_> hi bourbaki
08:12:49 <mugwump> Anyone know where I can find InternetLib?
08:14:54 <shapr> mugwump: it's part of Fudgets, you can get recent versions from Thomas Hallgren's cse.ogi.edu page.
08:15:10 <basti_> fudgets...
08:15:53 <basti_> :)
08:16:04 <basti_> how sweet it would be to compile.
08:17:29 <Lunar^> shapr: from the introduction, this paper seems appliable to Haskell
08:19:02 <mugwump> shapr: be sure to look at autrijus' Bamboo framework when he releases it - it's language neutral
08:19:26 <mugwump> (for a webapp abstraction)
08:19:48 <Oejet> Sweet, I implemented a type checker for my While compiler.
08:21:34 * Oejet plays with his toy language and plays he is Autrijus.
08:27:44 <jlouis> is there any particular reason why the Quote module doesn't use the standard library RNG?
08:28:44 <jlouis> We could get rid of a lot of cruft in the module and work it down to 30-40 lines altogther, I think
08:33:17 <Lunar^> shapr: This is definitely something really interesting for an Haskell OS running on hardward designed by Lava ;)
08:33:56 <mugwump> I have downloaded the binary fudgets distribution, fudgets-h13u, but there is no LibInternet inside...
08:34:06 <mugwump> maybe it's time to give up and switch to FreeBSD
08:35:10 <basti_> maybe its time to rework fudgets
08:35:13 <basti_> ;)
08:36:57 <vegai> what are you on now, then?
08:37:08 <mugwump> don't laugh
08:37:18 <mugwump> it begins with d and ends in ebian
08:38:01 <basti_> whats so funny about that?
08:38:34 <vegai> most here use that, probably :)
08:39:01 <shapr> jlouis: I wrote the quote module, it's a collection of ten minute hacks. Feel free to change it however.
08:39:03 <vegai> yeah, no fun in Debian whatsoever ;-)
08:39:18 <shapr> I like debian!
08:39:21 * vegai hides under a C++ manual.
08:39:29 <mugwump> well, shall we say that the problems debian has seem to have been getting worse for quite some time
08:39:30 <shapr> vegai: that's dangerous!
08:39:37 <shapr> Really? what problems?
08:40:31 <mugwump> Overwhelming red tape, maintainers that simply don't ever want to empathise with users, etc
08:40:49 <shapr> Hm, I know a lot of debian devs and I haven't seen much of that.
08:41:03 <shapr> The Zope dev was irritating for awhile, but now there's a new one :-)
08:41:15 <shapr> hiya BlindOwl, whoo are you?
08:41:42 <BlindOwl> tochiro.. previously known as vidvandre :)
08:41:44 <shapr> aha
08:42:01 <mugwump> Well, I guess it's subjective and not much point talking about it here.  But on a more positive note..
08:42:14 <shapr> jlouis: Yow's random choice function doesn't use System.Random because I didn't know about it at the time. That's the only reason.
08:42:14 <vegai> I agree about the red tape, but it's only a feeling. I have nothing concrete to back that
08:42:48 <shapr> mugwump: on the good side, all but one of the debian haskell devs hang out here on #haskell, so feedback is near instant.
08:44:26 <musasabi> debian is doing hard stuff and cares about things being broken and this shifts loads of work to it.
08:44:58 <mugwump> no doubt why your subjective experience is better.  well, perhaps you might have some hints as to how I can get programatica going on my debian system...
08:45:27 <shapr> There is no way I can power two opterons with a 300W power supply, why don't these server cases include a 500W psu option?
08:45:40 * shapr ghrumbles
08:46:14 <shapr> I used the binaries last time, I don't remember if I've built programatica or not.
08:46:14 <mugwump> I realise building a distro is hard, and equally that any comments like this don't apply to the thousands of developers involved.
08:47:25 <mugwump> mmm, I'm trying to use the binary dist too
08:47:41 <shapr> Having problems? What's the url to the binary?
08:49:41 <shapr> oooh, dual 600W PSUs, mmmm
08:50:18 <tuomov> insane
08:50:31 <musasabi> sounds suitable for heating a sauna.
08:51:08 <tuomov> I usd to have a 230W PSU before my mobo died last spring and I bought all new components and it was no longer sufficient
08:51:14 <shapr> ha, sauna PSUs!
08:51:23 <mugwump> aha, what I thought was the unpacked binary dist is actually a CVS checkout.  :-}
08:51:46 <shapr> I have a 400W for this dual athlon mp, and it's not really enough.
08:51:53 <tuomov> (it didn't immediately show that the mobo was broken but a month leter all the capacitors had some spills on them, so I just bought everything anew)
08:52:23 <tuomov> I think I have 350 or something now
08:52:25 <jlouis> shapr: ok, then it is being changed to the System.Random ones ;)
08:52:29 * tuomov thinkgs his computer is too powerful
08:52:30 <shapr> jlouis: thank you!
08:52:37 <shapr> too powerful?
08:52:37 <jlouis> shapr: We can also loose state in the QuoteModule too
08:52:57 <shapr> really? how so?
08:53:09 <tuomov> I could run setiathome or whatever on my old duron, as it didn't need that much cooling
08:53:21 <tuomov> but on this athlon xp 2500+ it is impossible
08:53:37 <jlouis> and Yow is dead. We use fortunefiles now, so /usr/share/games/fortune/zippy is the place to place your YOW! quotes. The module can then specialize to a given file for picking the random quote
08:53:37 <shapr> I was trying to unify various PRNG states into a single PRNG seed, that's what QuoteModule uses.
08:53:44 <tuomov> just a few minutes of full cpu usage and it is like a jet engine was being run in the flat
08:53:58 <jlouis> shapr: exactly. It is being hit upon with my holy hammer
08:54:08 <shapr> There's a better way?
08:54:15 <shapr> In any case, go for it :-)
08:54:25 <mugwump> yay, it's running now!  :-D
08:54:29 <jlouis> shapr: the IO monad keeps a global RNG satte
08:54:36 <jlouis> shapr: need I say more?
08:54:43 <mugwump> and it's *ugly*!
08:54:54 <jlouis> (PRNG initialised by ClockTime and the picosecond CPU counter ;)
08:55:58 <musasabi> One needs a monad for a prng.
08:57:20 <shapr> f
08:57:25 <shapr> oops, wrong window
08:57:44 <ibid> well, one *can* do one without monads but it's more error-prone and more confusing
08:58:08 <shapr> Yeah, better to do it with.
08:58:25 <musasabi> ibid: of course one can just pass the state as a parameter - but isn't that like using a state monad.
08:59:37 <ibid> musasabi: no, it's not (though a state monad encapsulates the pattern, yes)
09:00:23 <jlouis> shapr: now with a patch to dons@
09:00:35 <jlouis> yay!
09:00:44 <jlouis> and @yow is working in this new incarnation
09:04:15 <Igor^> hello
09:04:30 * vegai noticed unsafePerformIO.
09:04:41 <vegai> I don't whether I should be disgusted or excited
09:04:58 <CosmicRay> vegai: it is a necessary evil in some situations
09:11:24 <Lemmih> Cabal should be able to install packages on Hugs which are using the FFI, right?
09:14:19 <musasabi> Lemmih: yes.
09:14:27 <musasabi> at least I seem to remember so.
09:15:03 <Lemmih> And Hugs-20050308 is new enough, right?
09:17:28 <TFK> A month ago sounds pretty new...
09:17:42 <TFK> (Probably not English, but heck...)
09:18:30 <musasabi> hugs-20050224 worked at least.
09:18:46 <musasabi> tried a small package (Codec.Compression.LZF) which contains FFI.
09:20:17 <Lemmih> It's looking in the wrong places for the .so files.
09:21:37 <Lemmih> They are stored in dist/build/.. but Hugs is looking in the source dir for some reason.
09:26:56 <musasabi> my hugs opens /usr/local/lib/hugs/packages/Codec-Compression-LZF/Codec/Compression/LZF.hs
09:27:06 <musasabi> and /usr/local/lib/hugs/packages/Codec-Compression-LZF/Codec/Compression/LZF.so
09:27:17 <musasabi> so it appears to work.
09:29:29 <Lemmih> Oh d'oh. Standing in the src dir is of course stupid ):
09:33:35 <marcot> Hello.
09:33:39 <Lemmih> Hey marcot.
09:33:39 <marcot> How is the development of yi?
09:33:51 <marcot> Lemmih: hi. How are you?
09:34:13 <Lemmih> Great. Just tested my SDL binding on Hugs.
09:34:30 <marcot> SDL?
09:36:17 <Lemmih> http://www.libsdl.org
09:37:29 <marcot> alie la kanalo ne nomas esperanton.
09:38:42 <marcot> cool.. lgpl. I didn't know this library.
09:39:23 <marcot> Sorry for that esperanto message, wrong channel.
09:42:53 <Oejet> "Nobody in the channel speaks Esperanto."?
09:43:30 <kaol> haskell is the esperanto of programming languages
09:43:44 <autrijus> I thought haskell is the lojban.
09:43:55 <vegai> yeah, I agree with autrijus
09:44:18 <Oejet> Yeah, Haskell is more like Latin than Espareranto (Python).
09:44:35 <vegai> lisp is latin
09:44:42 <TFK> Haskell is dead?
09:44:45 <autrijus> yeah, I agree with vegai
09:44:51 <TFK> That Haskell is dead?...
09:45:07 <vegai> wha huh wha?
09:45:11 <TFK> (Becuase Latin is, as a language. Just setting the metaphore straight.)
09:45:15 <Oejet> TFK: Haskell is very dead.
09:45:17 <vegai> latin is lisp
09:45:21 <vegai> lisp is latin
09:45:23 <Heffalump> well, noone speaks latin.
09:45:27 <Heffalump> And noone speaks haskell.
09:45:31 <Heffalump> So the comparison is apt.
09:45:34 <autrijus> but strangely schools teach both.
09:45:40 <vegai> many speak something that spawned off latin
09:45:43 <CosmicRay> Heffalump obviously hasn't been watching TV in the last 24 hours
09:45:54 <autrijus> CosmicRay++ # rofl!
09:46:10 <CosmicRay> :-)
09:46:13 <xerox> ahah.
09:46:35 <vegai> (spank::Entity->BSDMAction) Heffalump
09:47:03 <Oejet> Auch. :-)
09:47:20 <TFK> It doesn't matter. Latin, as a language, is as dead as... well... some freaks still play ASCII RPGs, right?
09:48:09 <Oejet> TFK: Introductory Latin is taught in a lot of schools.
09:48:24 <Heffalump> CosmicRay: I don't have a TV.
09:48:24 <Igor^> hello, I am a newbie.. how can I import IO AND Parselib with hugs.  It returns me an error: Entity "bracket" imported from module "IO" already defined in module "Parselib".
09:48:28 <Heffalump> And I learnt latin until I was 18.
09:48:30 <Igor^> TIA
09:48:32 <TFK> Oejet, and?
09:48:40 <Heffalump> then I started learning Haskell.
09:49:10 <Oejet> TFK: I suppose you mean the spoken tounge.
09:49:22 <TFK> Do people write Latin fiction? Poetry? Are there any kids the mother tongue of whom is Latin?
09:49:49 <smott> in vatican i guess
09:49:56 <TFK> I thought that people actually *used* Haskell. Or so haskell.org would like you to believe ;-)
09:50:48 <Oejet> I'd bet that there is more poetry being written in Latin than programs written in Haskell.
09:50:51 <Heffalump> Igor^: import Parselib hiding (bracket)
09:51:03 <TFK> Oejet, if that is true, then it is very sad.
09:51:04 <Heffalump> (or vice versa, depending on which one you want)
09:51:18 <TFK> And what's even more sad, that Haskell hackers are giving up so easily :-/
09:51:55 <Oejet> TFK: Think about the proportions, how many learn Latin and how many learn even to program.
09:51:59 <araujo> TFK, why you say that?
09:51:59 <Heffalump> Oejet: do you mean currently, or historically.
09:52:08 <Oejet> Currently.
09:52:08 <Heffalump> I doubt many people who learn Latin write poetry now.
09:52:23 <Heffalump> maybe a few university students and some academics
09:52:25 <TFK> Oejet, and how many *use* Latin?
09:52:30 <Heffalump> Haskell will be several orders of magnitude larger.
09:52:33 <Oejet> I doubt that many people who learn to program learn Haskell.
09:52:38 <TFK> I mean, really use, not write a short poem as a class assignment.
09:52:47 <araujo> TFK, why you say that?
09:52:57 <TFK> araujo, why do I say what?
09:53:12 <araujo> TFK And what's even more sad, that Haskell hackers are giving up so easily :-/
09:53:30 <TFK> araujo, I don't see people who are against that metaphor.
09:53:48 <TFK> Where are the Ben-Yehudas of Haskell, I ask ye?!
09:53:50 <Igor^> "Comme le soleil d'or salue le matin et ayant doré l'océan de ses rayons, parcours le zodiac aux galops de son char resplendissant.. "
09:53:54 <araujo> That still doesn't explain why you say that 8)
09:53:56 <Igor^> :p
09:54:14 <TFK> I'm lamenting the fact that you gave up.
09:54:14 <jlouis> shapr: IO monad hiding RNG in the Quote module: -55 lines, no functional change ;)
09:56:19 <KrispyKringle> Having taken 6 years of Latin, the best I can contribute to this conversation is, Carpe carp.
09:56:23 <KrispyKringle> (Sieze the carp.)
09:56:38 <TFK> :-D
09:56:59 <Igor^> carpe diem !
09:57:00 <Oejet> KrispyKringle: Man, you need to get your school money back.
09:57:26 <KrispyKringle> Oejet: possibly. When I went to college, I decided I probably didn't know enough Latin to even try placing into a class.
09:57:46 <TFK> 6 years is a lot...
09:58:01 <delYsid> I've done 5 years of latin and forgot everything as well
09:58:04 <KrispyKringle> TFK: true, btu it's not thes ame as learning a spoken language.
09:58:15 <delYsid> ITs hard to remember stuff from a subject you truly hate deep down :)
09:58:23 <KrispyKringle> I could probably make a decent go at translating Virgil with a dictionary by my side, but I couldn't chit-chat with the pope, were he still alive.
09:58:33 <TFK> I would hate to believe that Haskellers hate Haskell deep down...
09:58:34 <KrispyKringle> delYsid: I didn't mind it. The history and culture were interesting.
09:59:20 <TFK> You should've taken Japanese instead :-)
09:59:21 <KrispyKringle> And it's actually intruiging, I think. I also took a tiny bit of Japanese, and the comparison between a language with very little grammatical structure and largely implicit meaning--but a whole lot of politeness kind of stuff--and one with a lot of specifics and as many tenses as exist in any language is quite interesting.
09:59:35 <KrispyKringle> heh
09:59:39 <KrispyKringle> ^^^
09:59:40 <Oejet> http://suberic.net/~marc/latinpoetry.html
09:59:40 <TFK> :-D
09:59:41 <shapr> hey delYsid!
09:59:50 <delYsid> shapr ! ltns
09:59:53 <shapr> wassup?
10:00:03 <KrispyKringle> My japanese skills extend to about navigating directions, ordering at restaurants, being a tourist...
10:00:22 <TFK> That's already more than I know :-)
10:00:34 <KrispyKringle> heh
10:00:40 <TFK> I should probably resume my kana studies so that I can at least read the dictionaries :-/
10:00:42 <delYsid> shapr: Just wanted to drop by since you never do on 'emacs anymore these days :)
10:00:54 <KrispyKringle> Yeah, I only knew about a hundred kanjii or so.
10:01:19 <KrispyKringle> I could read hiragana and katagana. Which isn't really that useful, since everything uses kanjii.
10:01:22 <TFK> Wow. That's... ninety-nine more kanju than I do :-/
10:01:23 <shapr> delYsid: yeah, I'm slowly moving out of emacs. Have I already mentioned Yi?
10:01:47 <delYsid> yeah, you did.
10:01:48 <KrispyKringle> TFK: you get fairly used to memorizing them, i'd say. Though I don't remember more than a few now.
10:01:59 <KrispyKringle> is Yi the one written in haskell that you are always pushing? :P
10:02:00 <shapr> delYsid: written any fun code lately?
10:02:09 <shapr> KrispyKringle: I'm not pushing it, I just want to use it.
10:02:21 <shapr> And the syntax highlighting preview code is in Yi now! w00!
10:02:22 <TFK> KrispyKringle, yeah, but for beginners it's much more practical. You can always ask a Japanese person to write in kana, but memorizing that many, unless you're living in Japan (which is a whole different story) is daunting.
10:02:27 <KrispyKringle> shapr: I'm curious to try it out.
10:02:37 <shapr> delYsid: I want parse tree macros! w00!
10:02:39 <KrispyKringle> TFK: oh, definitely true.
10:02:54 <shapr> delYsid: hey, have you seen pugs?
10:03:20 <KrispyKringle> TFK: I visited Japan after I graduated high school, you know, while my japanese was still fresh. I could get around, and my Japanese was frequently as good or better than the English of older people, less fluent people, etc. But I wasn't what you'd call conversational.
10:03:37 <KrispyKringle> In Hokkaido, fewer people speak English well, so it was definitely handy.
10:03:39 <shapr> delYsid: c'mon whatcha codin these days?
10:03:42 * shapr boings
10:03:48 <TFK> KrispyKringle, awesome :-D
10:03:56 <KrispyKringle> :)
10:03:59 <TFK> I haven't been to Japan yet. Probably won't in quite some time :-(
10:04:00 <KrispyKringle> I forget it all, now, of course.
10:04:04 <KrispyKringle> heh
10:04:08 <KrispyKringle> it's interesting. It's a funny place.
10:04:13 <delYsid> shapr: A OpenSound Control client/server library for UDP (including ieee floating point conversion for elisp) and a small library I'm hacking on to read/write MIDI files in elisp.
10:04:17 <KrispyKringle> I wouldn't want to live there, but it's interesting to visit.
10:04:21 <shapr> oh, nifty
10:04:33 <delYsid> I can already parse standard MIDI files perfectly into event streams, editor to come :)
10:04:33 * shapr looks up OpenSound
10:04:46 <TFK> That's a pity. But Japanese is easy to keep up with, I reckon. I already watch and like anime a lot, so I would never forget (if I ever learned) :-P
10:04:52 <shapr> Oh, OpenSound is a good idea.
10:05:07 <TFK> KrispyKringle, there's no place like home, is there? :-)
10:05:23 <KrispyKringle> The lack of much grammar makes it much easier, but the politeness stuff makes it a bit tougher. Since there's frequently multiple ways to say something depnding on who (in terms of social rank) you are talking to.
10:05:25 <delYsid> OSC is cool
10:05:35 <KrispyKringle> And while with bad grammar you never offend people, with bad politeness you do.
10:06:06 <TFK> Don't they take your gai-jin status into consideration? (I.e., that you'll make mistakes?)
10:06:09 <KrispyKringle> TFK: i don't know about that. I'd definitely move to some countries in a heartbeat. But Japan would be too foreign, I think. The values and social norms are just very different.
10:06:13 <Heffalump> bad grammar offends me when people just don't care
10:06:14 <delYsid> I'm also writing a client for a LinuxAudio SoftSynth for Emacs based on the osc.el lib
10:06:21 <KrispyKringle> Well, yeah, they'd be pretty forgiving of a foreigner.
10:06:39 <KrispyKringle> so it's not like it's a huge concern, I think.
10:06:45 * TFK nods
10:07:11 <KrispyKringle> anyway, i gotta get moving now.
10:07:15 <KrispyKringle> nice talking to you.
10:07:15 <TFK> If you don't mind me asking, what's a Gentoo developer doing in #haskell? I thought Gentoo was all about Python? :-)
10:07:32 <TFK> You too, cya :-)
10:08:08 <KrispyKringle> TFK: I'm actually on hiatus from Gentoo.
10:08:12 <KrispyKringle> for a few months.
10:08:20 <KrispyKringle> but Gentoo does have a Haskell herd.
10:08:33 <KrispyKringle> dev-haskell group in portage.
10:09:06 <KrispyKringle> I'm taking a course now in haskell, so I've been harassing all the kind folks in here. That's the real story. But I like it ;)
10:10:29 <marcot> I can't compile yi.
10:10:34 <marcot> When I try it say:
10:10:42 <marcot> Makefile:7: mk/config.mk: Arquivo ou diretÃ³rio nÃ£o encontrado
10:10:49 <marcot> File or directory not found
10:11:28 <Heffalump> ooh, haskell-http finally accepted into Debian.
10:14:09 <KrispyKringle> marcot: looks like spanish :P
10:14:17 <marcot> KrispyKringle: it's portuguese.
10:14:21 <shapr> delYsid: want to hack on perl6?
10:14:30 <KrispyKringle> ah
10:15:10 <marcot> KrispyKringle: it's similar to spanish.
10:15:30 <shapr> delYsid: hey, you have any experience with recent dual opteron mobos? Do the Tyan mobos with Nvidia chipset work okay?
10:18:15 <delYsid> Well, how recent?
10:18:25 <shapr> I dunno, this year?
10:18:38 <delYsid> The machine we bought 6 months ago at work works truly nice, but we dont do any local graphics...
10:19:05 <delYsid> Its a tyan with 2x246
10:19:14 <shapr> What mobo are you using? Does it handle constant 200% without crashing?
10:19:35 <delYsid> never had any instability problems
10:19:42 <delYsid> and I kicked the box much more than 200% at times
10:20:08 <delYsid> hmm, I dont remember offhand what board that exactly was
10:20:30 <delYsid> Having trouble with AMD64?
10:20:45 <shapr> No, but I had trouble with my dual Athlon MP, and I don't want to get bitten again.
10:21:06 <delYsid> Since I am thinking back and forth if my next home-box should be dual(core) opteron or 2xXEON
10:21:18 <shapr> What about a Cell workstation?
10:21:39 <delYsid> hmm?
10:22:10 <shapr> Cell claims to run Linux, and the chip should be cheap to fabricate, so I wonder if that's a better value.
10:23:10 <delYsid> well, I do a lot of realtime audio these days, I want a damn fast piece of metal, no experiments this time
10:23:15 <Heffalump> Cell seems quite big, will it really be cheap to fab?
10:23:39 <shapr> iirc, Cell is smaller than existing P4s
10:24:12 <Heffalump> that's not hard.
10:24:12 <delYsid> shapr: I might have missed something lately, who or what is Cell exactly?
10:24:13 <shapr> It fewer pieces and a smaller die. And should be clocked much higher since the longest path is so much shorter.
10:24:21 <Heffalump> I guess I'm getting used to ARM-sized things now.
10:25:10 <shapr> delYsid: IBM/Toshiba/Sony designed a new CPU for the PS3. It's a single full-sized CPU with six (eight?) sidekick CPUs it uses sort of like vector units.
10:25:23 <delYsid> should, will... so its not out there yet.
10:25:46 <shapr> That's correct. I dunno if I want to wait a few months to check out Cell prices.
10:25:51 <delYsid> ahh, gamer stuff, IC
10:26:24 <shapr> It's more like a nine-core die. http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/cpu/cell-1.ars
10:26:51 <delYsid> ars? :)
10:27:12 <shapr> But eight of the cores are using a risc-like tradeoff where they have no cache, 256k of local memory, and only a 2 instruction out of order execution unit.
10:27:18 <jlouis> it returns text/html as the MIME type
10:28:44 <shapr> I'm interested in declarative parallelism, so the Cell would be a fun desktop. And I wouldn't miss the x86-only games since I don't play them.
10:29:29 <shapr> delYsid: anyway, why a xeon for sound synthesis?
10:31:28 <KrispyKringle> yea, it's ASP.NET.
10:31:31 <KrispyKringle> I was wondering about that, too.
10:31:43 <TFK> KrispyKringle, yup, I'm also studying Haskell from a Python perspective.
10:32:06 <KrispyKringle> TFK: I've found that after learning Haskell, I write Python in a much more functional (better?) style.
10:32:14 <KrispyKringle> My python is no longer just translated Perl. ;)
10:32:45 <TFK> I've heard scary things about Perl...
10:32:52 <KrispyKringle> I might really be going bald. I'm finding hair on my keyboard.
10:33:00 <shapr> KrispyKringle: maybe it's a were-keyboard
10:33:09 <TFK> I'm finding hair in my soup... but that's probably my cat :-/
10:33:13 <KrispyKringle> TFK: I used to be a big fan of Perl. It gets the job done very easily. But for anything over a certain size, it's just insuitable. Perl modules are no fun, for instance.
10:33:13 <TFK> *hairs
10:33:19 <KrispyKringle> shapr: Possible. Is it a full moon?
10:33:40 <shapr> I'm finding hair on my chest, maybe I'm a MALE?
10:33:46 * shapr is shocked
10:35:13 <marcot> dons: are you there?
10:35:20 <KrispyKringle> hmm. I was trying to find a link fo this freaky fur-covered powerbook I saw a while back. No luck.
10:35:39 <shapr> too bad
10:35:43 <KrispyKringle> http://www.malaran.com/2.0/ibook/furbook.html
10:36:17 <shapr> nifty!
10:36:39 <TFK> Kinky...
10:36:41 <delYsid> shapr: Why not?
10:36:47 <KrispyKringle> freaky, I'd say.
10:38:14 <shapr> delYsid: As I understand it, xeons have a longer pipeline between ram and cpu, so I'd think you'd want something else for realtime sound work. I thought xeons were more for efficient running of multiple batch processes at the same time.
10:39:22 <delYsid> what alternative would you suggest then?
10:39:51 <shapr> I'm not sure, I haven't had realtime low-latency work in mind when I'm shopping for hardware.
10:40:59 <delYsid> Well, I actually thought XEON since they are the only ones from intel I can have in pairs, and I am a bit reluctant with amd64 still.
10:41:52 <shapr> I know some linux realtime geeks I can ask, I can probably find out in the next week.
10:43:25 <delYsid> that'd be interesting
10:45:52 <delYsid> If only Debian had an official AMD64 port, its sooo embarrassing
10:51:55 <vegai> does anything have that yet?
10:52:33 <vegai> uhh, hmm?
10:52:40 <vegai> delYsid: http://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/ -- isn't that official?
10:54:07 <Igloo> "The AMD64 port is currently waiting to be included into the official Debian archive." (from that page  :-)  )
10:55:41 <KrispyKringle> vegai: Gentoo actually has amd64 as a supported arch.
10:55:44 <KrispyKringle> I believe.
10:56:37 <KrispyKringle> yeah, it is.
10:57:49 <sjanssen> Suse, Fedora Core also have AMD64 ports (if you go for that kind of thing)
10:58:34 <KrispyKringle> I'm sure Sourcemage do, because they're better than Gentoo in every way.
10:58:38 <KrispyKringle> </sarcasm>
10:59:10 <sjanssen> KrispyKringle: are you a Gentoo user?
10:59:26 <KrispyKringle> sjanssen: Yes.
10:59:36 <vegai> well
10:59:47 <vegai> one could (humorously perhaps) argue that Gentoo has no supported archs
11:00:05 <vegai> but I don't want to go there :)
11:00:06 <sjanssen> so I suppose you've seen that Sourcemage wiki page . . . they seem to be very bitter people
11:00:12 <KrispyKringle> yeah, they do
11:01:02 <vegai> Igloo: oh, he meant that.
11:02:38 <KrispyKringle> vegai: well, no, it may be valid. Supported means "security supported," not "never crashes." ;)
11:05:11 * CosmicRay is an amd64 user
11:05:17 <CosmicRay> the Debian amd64 port is very complete
11:05:23 <CosmicRay> I use it on one of my boxen
11:05:30 <CosmicRay> it's just like any other debian port, really
11:05:49 <CosmicRay> the only reason it's not an official port seems to be the mirror system
11:05:49 <KrispyKringle> as in, they say it's not stable, but it's more stable than most of the rest ;)
11:06:37 <CosmicRay> my complaint about gentoo is that it is not the same on every arch, even though they are in the best position to be so
11:07:45 <CosmicRay> and this has nothing to do with the fact that they masked offlineimap on alpha simply because nobody ever bothered to try it there :-)
11:07:52 <CosmicRay> (offlineimap being written in 100% python...)
11:07:59 <KrispyKringle> CosmicRay: in what way is it not the same?
11:08:33 <KrispyKringle> yeah, we used to have talk of a policy to make testing for interpreted languages easier, but hasn't been done, as far as i know.
11:08:37 <KrispyKringle> we'd rather NOT break the tree ;)
11:08:41 <CosmicRay> KrispyKringle: their over-conservative masking policy means that a default installation will not give you the same versions of packages on all archs, and in some cases, no packes at all
11:09:00 <KrispyKringle> CosmicRay: ah, im surprised to hear gentoo referred to as "over conservative." most would say the opposite! :P
11:09:06 <CosmicRay> KrispyKringle: of course, if I were to accept ~alpha, then I get in the stuff that is really known to be broken
11:09:15 <CosmicRay> KrispyKringle: and from a Debian developer, too :-)
11:09:40 <KrispyKringle> hehe
11:09:52 <KrispyKringle> you can do per-package stuff, of course, but that's kinda pointless, in the grand scheme of things
11:10:02 <CosmicRay> basically, my argument at the time was that it is not possible for offlineimap to have an arch-specific bug.  if there was an arch-specific problem, it would be a bug in python
11:10:07 <CosmicRay> right
11:10:15 <CosmicRay> I'd have to research the situation behind every different package
11:10:23 <CosmicRay> not necessarily a trivial thing to do, times n archs
11:10:56 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: haskell-http was accepted into sid today
11:11:00 <Heffalump> yep, I noticed.
11:11:17 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: now you will probably have to prepare a -2 so that it builds with the latest cabal :-)
11:11:18 <CosmicRay> 240
11:11:26 <Heffalump> great.
11:11:40 * Heffalump is busy at least till Wednesday.
11:12:09 <CosmicRay> KrispyKringle: are you a gentoo developer?
11:13:06 <CosmicRay> sourcemage actually sounds interesting from their website
11:13:10 <CosmicRay> anyone here have much experience with i?
11:13:48 <CosmicRay> my other main gripe about gentoo is I can't just say "emerge foo", wait x hours, and expect it to have actually succeeded
11:14:07 <CosmicRay> compile errors, missing/unfulfillable dependencies, etc cause trouble
11:15:04 <CosmicRay> hmm, no sourcemage for alpha, never mind :-)
11:17:12 <vegai> oh, they're gonna merge with Lunar
11:17:18 <tuomov> CosmicRay: that's exactly why I avoid source distros
11:17:24 <vegai> that might be interesting
11:17:32 <Crusoe> Weee, http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/
11:17:41 <Crusoe> Finally a paper that will help explain it... :)
11:17:57 <CosmicRay> tuomov: in theiry, testing could have them keep the same quality as, say, debian
11:18:13 <CosmicRay> tuomov: but it seems that the existing management schemes don't really keep up that sort of rigorous testing
11:18:30 <tuomov> well, that would require some changes in the build architechture so that /usr/local etc. doesn't interfere
11:19:06 <vegai> hmm, perhaps some sort of modified chroot...
11:19:32 <CosmicRay> debian autobuilders use a chroot system
11:19:33 <tuomov> IMHO, apps should be installed in /distroname/app/app-version with links in /distroname/bin/ etc.
11:19:40 <tuomov> with local being one distroname
11:20:03 <tuomov> and nothing in one distro would use anything from others
11:20:04 * CosmicRay afks for awhile
11:20:12 <tuomov> except local
11:20:28 <vegai> something like Gobo?
11:20:46 <tuomov> well, there are some appdirectory distros, but they use ugly MixeDC CaSe NaMeS etc.
11:21:55 <vegai> isn't that just a detail?
11:22:03 <tuomov> libraries would also not be searched from /.../lib but one would explicitly have to specify link to some /.../lib-version/lib/libfoo.so
11:22:15 <tuomov> vegai: a _very_ important one from usability pow
11:23:02 <vegai> can be helped with modifying the shell a bit
11:23:18 <vegai> with=>by
11:23:51 <tuomov> Long Names With Spaces Are Still Very Annoying
11:23:57 <vegai> yes, ok. You're right
11:24:41 <tuomov> links (esp. sym) don't help, because the long name will still pop up in some situations
11:30:30 <Crusoe> Rubyx puts everything under pkg, with symlinks to the proper places.
11:31:41 <tuomov> I'd rather remove the (sym)links except for bin
11:32:00 <tuomov> gcc library/header search is a mess, /usr/lib /usr/include etc. should be abolished
11:34:38 <tuomov> oh, and together with this change autoconf scripts could be abolished as well..
11:34:53 <Igor^> hello.. how can I list all lines in a file with hugs ?
11:43:05 <jlouis> Igor^: you mean convert a file to a list of lines?

11:51:01 <marcot> I'm having a problem with yi in debian.
11:51:04 <marcot> Can someone help me?
11:51:11 <marcot> When I try to run it, it sais:
11:51:22 <marcot> Fail: /usr/lib/ghc-6.2.1/package.conf: openFile: does not exist (Arquivo ou diretÃ³rio nÃ£o encontrado)
11:51:27 <marcot> File not found.

11:52:20 <marcot> I think it should use ghc-6.2.2, shouldn't it?
11:52:28 <jlouis> Hmmm, DummyModule needs to be refactored a bit
11:53:21 <Igloo> What does "type ghc" say?
11:53:42 <marcot> ghc is /usr/bin/ghc
11:54:13 <Igloo> And   dpkg -s ghc6 | grep "^Version"   ?

12:10:27 <TFK> And if I don't have a webserver? :-)
12:10:49 <SyntaxNinja> hm. I wish I could get lambdabot to not show up in its own tab
12:11:05 <TFK> I wish I could make lambdabot to show in a separate tab :-/
12:11:24 <TFK> I'll swap with you :-)
12:11:32 <jlouis> TFK: Well, it means that any website will do, especially if you have rsync/shell access
12:11:48 <TheHunter> hehe, the output left in- bug.

12:19:14 <cevans> Does anyone here know where I can find adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta implementation (or something similar) in Haskell? Or do I need to write my own?
12:23:55 <Cale> cevans: I'm not sure if there's one written in Haskell. Googling doesn't seem to get many obviously useful hits. You could of course use the FFI and import one from C.
12:25:14 <cevans> Yes. I can probably just write one, since it can't be that much worse that a fixed step-size rk, which only takes about 14 lines of haskell (only 5 for the stepper).
12:34:28 * SamB wonders how to get a nice dependency graph (in pictorial form)
12:35:15 <desrt> SamB; graphviz will help
12:36:02 <SamB> desrt: well yes, I figured, but I am feeling too lazy to write code to convert GHC's dependency output to dot format
12:36:20 <musasabi> SamB: I think there is a branch which does this.
12:38:47 <musasabi> SamB: look for pluggable-1-branch
12:40:37 <SamB> I don't have scads of diskspace to compile branches
13:16:28 <metaperl> I need a little syntax help here:
13:16:29 <metaperl> hcf a b
13:16:30 <metaperl>   | a rem b == 0 = b
13:16:30 <metaperl>   | otherwise = hcf b r
13:16:30 <metaperl>                 where r = a - b*t
13:16:30 <metaperl>                       t = a `quot` b
13:19:05 <earthy> what is the error?
13:19:08 <Sonarman> first of all, don't you want a `rem` b?
13:19:32 <earthy> ah. gotcha.
13:19:41 <earthy> there's an application of a to rem and b
13:19:58 <earthy> sonarman: yes, he does. ;)
13:20:14 <norpan> but it's not a syntax error
13:20:21 <earthy> exactly
13:20:24 <earthy> it's a type error ;)
13:20:53 <metaperl> http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Euclid.shtml
13:21:01 <metaperl> that's Euclid's algorithm
13:21:11 <earthy> I had recognized it.
13:21:30 <norpan> hmmmm, gcd
13:22:04 <metaperl> no, I dont think I want a `rem` b
13:22:11 <metaperl> but I do want this type error fixed :)
13:22:13 <earthy> metaperl: yes you do.
13:22:24 * metaperl scowls in confusion
13:22:25 <earthy> where it says   a rem b  you want a `rem` b  :)
13:22:58 <norpan> or `mod`
13:22:59 <earthy> to turn the application of  a  to rem and b in an application of rem to a and b
13:24:09 <metaperl> a = bt * r
13:24:23 <metaperl> t is the result of a `quot` b
13:24:28 <metaperl> t = a `quot` b
13:25:03 <norpan> i don't like "where" though
13:25:06 <norpan> i like "let" better
13:25:22 <norpan> but maybe that's just me
13:25:23 <earthy> norpan: that's a matter of stile
13:25:25 <metaperl> but you see my point about a `quot` b
13:25:30 <earthy> style, that is :P
13:25:38 <vegai> dvorak?
13:25:46 <norpan> earthy: not entirely, let can be used anywhere, "where" can only be used in declarations
13:26:18 <Cale> well, let can be used anywhere that an expression is expected
13:26:19 <norpan> and where has complicated layout implications which makes my head hurt
13:26:30 <metaperl> oh it does?
13:26:32 <norpan> Cale: yes, and an expression can be anywhere :)
13:26:43 <norpan> metaperl: yes, it does
13:26:45 <Cale> it can't be placed at the top level :)
13:26:48 <metaperl> CAle is a math major... didy ou see my code to calculate the gcd Cale?
13:26:50 <vegai> seems like happy isn't so happy about ghc-6.4
13:26:57 <Cale> metaperl: no, not yet
13:27:01 <norpan> ln -s happy sad
13:27:09 <Cale> where also scopes over guards
13:27:11 <metaperl> {- http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Euclid.shtml -}
13:27:11 <metaperl>  
13:27:11 <metaperl> hcf a b
13:27:11 <metaperl>   | a rem b == 0 = b
13:27:11 <metaperl>   | otherwise = hcf b r
13:27:11 <metaperl>                 where r = a - b*t
13:27:13 <metaperl>                       t = a `quot` b
13:27:13 <Cale> whereas let doesn't.
13:28:18 <Cale> :)
13:28:18 <norpan> which makes it even harder to understand
13:28:22 <Cale> nice
13:28:30 <metaperl> Cale, it doesnt work
13:28:33 <Cale> norpan: no, that can be useful a lot of the time
13:28:41 <metaperl> I get a heinous type error
13:28:43 <norpan> i'd rather use let and case
13:28:55 <Cale> well let's see :)
13:29:02 <Cale> it's probably just a simple numerics thing :)
13:29:10 <norpan> we already said you need `rem`
13:29:40 <metaperl> oh it works
13:29:42 <Cale> `rem`
13:29:44 <Cale> yes
13:29:48 <metaperl> no I left off the backticks on `rem`
13:29:55 <metaperl> earthy, I was right man
13:30:01 <Cale> yeah, I noticed that
13:30:13 <Cale> just as norpan was mentioning it
13:30:26 <metaperl> ok, well nice working with you cats on this.... the Thompson book is great
13:30:45 <metaperl> I hate paying money for a book on a free software system like Haskell, but this book was worth every penny
13:30:54 <metaperl> nothing free matches it
13:31:19 <Cale> that's a nice clear implemetation of the gcd :)
13:31:44 <norpan> also, with only one guard and otherwise, i'd rather use if then else
13:31:44 <metaperl> thanks. Haskell can be that way
13:31:47 <metaperl> unlike Perl
13:31:55 <metaperl> I hate if-then-else
13:32:46 <norpan> indeed
13:35:54 <norpan> gcd a b = if rem a b == 0 then b else gcd b (a - b * quot a b)
13:36:06 <norpan> look, it fitted in one row :)
13:36:50 <norpan> and even a matematician could read that one without knowing haskell syntax
13:37:23 <metaperl> a chacun son gout
13:37:45 <shapr> como?
13:38:12 <basti_> metaperl: un chasseur sachant chasser, chasse sans son chien?
13:38:55 <metaperl> chien == cat, sans == without... the rest I dont know
13:39:08 <shapr> I think chien is dog.
13:39:55 <norpan> chasse is moose
13:40:02 <norpan> and chien is dog
13:40:36 <metaperl> chat == cat
13:40:44 <norpan> oui
13:40:51 <shapr> It sounds like a french tongue twister.
13:42:56 <vegai> anyone succeeded in building happy with ghc-6.4?
13:46:13 <Khisanth> norpan: assuming the mathematician doesn't know BASIC >_<
13:47:07 <norpan> what's basic got to do with it
13:47:57 <Khisanth> the rem! :)
13:48:04 <norpan> ah
13:48:07 * vegai snickers.
13:48:13 <norpan> i change it to mod then
13:48:27 <gzl> i have a thorny WASH problem. i have an evaluate function that parses some text and turns it into some kind of tree structure; then I have an 'evaluate' function that converts this recursively into HTML using WASH. the problem is that WASH does this thing with constantly checking the current "context" to see which tags can be used, and with such a recursive function the contexts are conflicting. the code and the error are at http://rafb.net/paste/results/nzz8Rr98.
13:49:26 <gzl> as soon as it gets to the second option of the case statement, it craps out
13:49:38 <Cale> gzl: that paste doesn't work
13:50:04 <gzl> you can't load the page, or the code is broken?
13:50:19 <metaperl> cant load page
13:50:37 <gzl> maybe the link got cut off? http://rafb.net/paste/results/nzz8Rr98.html works for me
13:50:52 <metaperl> paste here: http://paste.lisp.org/new/haskell
13:50:57 <metaperl> oh the html was not there
13:51:05 <metaperl> the ".html" extension on the file was not there
13:51:07 <gzl> ah, ok
13:51:13 <gzl> now it works?
13:51:29 <metaperl> yes
13:51:39 <metaperl> you know Philippa has written some of a wiki already?
13:51:55 <gzl> i know about flippi, if that's what you mean
13:52:01 <metaperl> yes
13:52:03 <gzl> but flippi doesn't use WASH, so that's not helping me
13:54:00 <gzl> really, WASH is the whole problem, all this code works fine with Text.Html
13:54:12 <gzl> (but I can't use it)
13:54:28 <metaperl> gzi, I am an amateur, so I dont know what the problem is, but the error you report is on line 54 and the paste only shows ~30 lines
13:54:43 <metaperl> so anyone wanting to fix it would probably want to see line 54
13:55:21 <gzl> line 54 is line 17 in that paste
13:55:47 <gzl> it's just because i only pasted the relevant portions of the code file
13:56:09 <shapr> Just curious, why do you want to use WASH over Text.Html?
13:56:24 <gzl> my professor wants us to use WASH
13:56:30 <gzl> only reason
13:56:37 <shapr> oh, ok then.
13:56:48 <Heffalump> is your professor Peter Thiemann or something? :-)
13:56:53 <gzl> no, benjamin pierce
13:57:15 <shapr> What result do you get if you comment out everything but the first line and the >> eval ... last line?
13:57:24 <shapr> specifically, what type is the resulting function?
13:57:31 <gzl> checking, one moment.
13:58:14 <shapr> I'm guessing that the "Bold xs ..." line sticks the return type into B, which is likely short for Bold
13:58:24 <Heffalump> hmm, busy.
13:59:21 <shapr> gzl: you see what I mean?
13:59:27 <gzl> yes
14:00:11 <gzl> it's WithHTML B m ()
14:00:37 <shapr> So I'd suggest you give it an explicit type that allows all of those HTML tag returns, or if that's not possible, find another way.
14:00:59 <gzl> well, I don't know of any such explicit type, I was hoping someone here might know how to do that
14:01:05 <norpan> curling on eurosport in 15 minutes
14:01:27 <shapr> Is this like curling the arm exercise?
14:01:38 <shapr> I was not aware that was a sport.
14:01:41 <liquidengineer> hi
14:01:47 <gzl> the thing is, you can do case statements in WASH, i.e. on one branch return (b $ text "foo") and on another return (i $ text "foo")
14:01:52 <shapr> Greetings liquidengineer
14:01:54 <liquidengineer> How does one derive a show function for a type?
14:01:57 <gzl> it's just the recursion screwing it up
14:02:07 <liquidengineer> as in, a type declared with the type keyword, not the data keyword
14:02:11 <norpan> shapr: of course it's a sport
14:02:22 <shapr> gzl: in that case, write a demo function that does what you describe, ask GHCi for the type, and use that!
14:02:26 <basti_> liquidengineer: show :: MyType -> String
14:02:31 <basti_> ah oh no that wont work
14:02:38 <shapr> I type with my toes. Is that a sport?
14:02:42 <basti_> since a type synonym cant be a member of a class
14:02:57 <norpan> instance Sport Curling where
14:03:07 <shapr> instance Sport ToeTyping where
14:03:12 <liquidengineer> I've already got a function that converts the type to a list of strings and prints it
14:03:21 <liquidengineer> I just need to tell it to use that somehow
14:03:40 <norpan> i guess that if some people get together and type with their toes and see who does it the fastest it could be a sport
14:03:57 <liquidengineer> Here's my type:
14:04:04 <liquidengineer> type Gbk = [(Name, Score, Score, Score, Total, Grade)]
14:04:21 <shapr> oh nooooo, not Gbk again.
14:04:22 <liquidengineer> I've got a function showGbk that takes one of these and prints it
14:04:41 <jlouis> instance Show Gbk where
14:04:41 <liquidengineer> shapr: relax...I'm not worried about the gbk logic anymore
14:04:43 <mwc> Does anybody know of a better haskell mode for Vim than the stock one?
14:04:44 <gzl> shapr: hm, didn't think of that. i assumed that the recursion would break it even if i tried that, but let me give it a whirl
14:04:44 <basti_> whats Gbk?
14:04:49 <jlouis>   show = map showGbk
14:05:13 <jlouis> again
14:05:14 <jlouis> instance Show Gbk where
14:05:15 <gzl> wow this type is insane!
14:05:16 <jlouis>   show = map showGbk
14:05:16 <liquidengineer> jlouis: pardon?
14:05:18 <liquidengineer> oh
14:05:30 <jlouis> liquidengineer: something like that
14:05:31 <basti_> jlouis: does that work with type synonymes?
14:05:31 <liquidengineer> ya'll leave my Gbk type alone...it wasn't my idea
14:05:34 <shapr> gzl: if it has any bearing on the type of the other code...
14:05:48 <norpan> my definition of sport requires physical activity and competition, and curling has both
14:05:59 <shapr> Is a chess a sport?
14:06:22 <norpan> it fails on the physical activity bit; moving the pieces is not enough
14:06:26 <gzl> haha this type declaration is going to be a page long
14:06:35 <jlouis> basti_: doh, not sure
14:06:48 <mwc> norpan, how about sport as a challenge which requires you to enjoyable exert yourself to succeed
14:06:58 <mwc> ie: mountain climbing, off road biking, etc
14:07:03 <shapr> Does that mean the IOCCC is a sport?
14:07:15 <norpan> it must be competition to be sport in my book
14:07:22 <basti_> liquidengineer: afaik "type" types ("type synonyms") would be Showable if they're all "Show" Items... so i dont see your problem.
14:07:28 <shapr> I do mountain unicycling, and I consider that a sport.
14:07:44 <mwc> shapr, or a deathwish
14:07:59 <shapr> mwc: I claim it's safer than mountain bicycling.
14:08:06 <basti_> liquidengineer: if i declare a type with type, i can show it.
14:08:09 <shapr> With a unicycle you can just pick up your feet to get off.
14:08:18 <norpan> i suppose you have lower speeds when unicycling too
14:08:26 <mwc> shapr, heheh, true, but I prefer to play mountain goat myself
14:08:26 <shapr> mostly, yeah.
14:08:29 <basti_> liquidengineer: care about your Name, Score etc. values, they need to be showable.
14:08:43 <norpan> i unicycled 10 km once
14:08:45 <basti_> liquidengineer: i bet there's a "data" declaration among them somewhere.
14:08:47 <norpan> it was hard
14:08:50 <liquidengineer> "cannot use type synonym in instance head
14:08:51 <liquidengineer> grr
14:08:52 <jlouis> basti_: You are right
14:08:56 <shapr> mwc: I think unicycles are more agile than bicycles, but bicycles are faster.
14:08:59 <basti_> i bicycled 180 km at one day.
14:09:02 <basti_> :)
14:09:09 <shapr> I tricycled for YEARS!
14:09:21 <liquidengineer> basti: There is indeed
14:09:22 <norpan> i bicycled from sweden to gibraltar in 6 weeks
14:09:30 <mwc> I'm still pissed that the haskell mode doesn't autoindent properly
14:09:30 <basti_> liquidengineer: =)
14:09:35 <norpan> imagine unicycling that distance
14:09:37 <mwc> seems like the rules are pretty simpler
14:09:47 <basti_> liquidengineer: and you wont be able ever to declare a synonym member of a class
14:09:48 <mwc> *pretty simle
14:10:00 <shapr> norpan: I'd love to, but so far I can only unicycle for about three hours straight without, um, adverse effects.
14:10:15 <shapr> crotch pressure is significantly higher in unicycling.
14:10:16 <Lemmih> mwc: The emacs mode is acceptable.
14:10:18 <basti_> -g-
14:10:23 <liquidengineer> basti: type Gbk = [(Name, Score, Score, Score, Total, Grade)] <-- Grade is an enumerated type.  All the others are just typedefs of strings and ints and floats
14:10:35 <mwc> Lemmih, yeah, emacs is great, just needs a decent text editor :P
14:10:38 <norpan> you have to design a saddle design that doesn't crunch your crotch
14:10:45 <basti_> liquidengineer: then you need to care about Grade
14:10:57 <liquidengineer> basti_: hmm?
14:11:00 <liquidengineer> it already derives show
14:11:12 <mwc> Lemmih, on a more serious note, I don't like how often I need to go hit control-this-contrl-that
14:11:23 <shapr> mwc: there's viper-mode
14:11:26 <SamB> mwc: the rules are simple enough, but the indentation is syntactically significant and there is no one style
14:11:46 <liquidengineer> basti_: what else can I do to make it happy?
14:11:47 <jlouis> liquidengineer: then you need to tell it how to show a grade
14:11:48 <mwc> SamB, yeah, but I'd think that autoindent after where, of, let, etc would be easy to do
14:12:00 <shapr> mwc: hack on Yi!
14:12:02 <jlouis> instance Show Grade where ...
14:12:18 <liquidengineer> this is so wierd to me, though
14:12:23 <liquidengineer> showGbk works fine.
14:12:36 <liquidengineer> of course, it converts everything to a string first
14:12:52 <Cale> liquidengineer: did you put the code up somewhere?
14:13:01 <liquidengineer> I can
14:13:23 <liquidengineer> see, the thing is, it's giving me this show nonsense on the update function that returns a gradebook
14:13:32 <liquidengineer> I just want it to modify the gradebook, not display it
14:13:39 <liquidengineer> but I'm not sure how to tell it that
14:14:33 <Cale> okay, can I see that bit? It doesn't sound like you should need a Show constraint for that.
14:15:15 <liquidengineer> the update function?
14:15:16 <liquidengineer> yeah
14:16:36 <liquidengineer> Cale: do you want to see the functions that update calls?
14:16:56 <lightstep> is fixIO fully general? fixIO (
14:17:17 <lightstep> fixIO (\str -> putStr str >> readLine)  <-- comes to mind
14:17:18 <Cale> liquidengineer: if possible, or at least their types
14:18:18 <shapr> lightstep: try it
14:18:30 <lightstep> i'm afraid it might crash the system
14:18:45 <shapr> If it kills your box, I'll give you a rebate.
14:19:04 <shapr> I'll refund the purchase price of every piece of Haskell advice I've ever given!
14:19:08 * wagle sells popcorn
14:19:58 <liquidengineer> Cale: it's there now
14:20:01 <lightstep> so how does it know to do threads? doesn't it think it's in a loop in that case too?
14:20:06 <wagle> actually, i was wondering if you were worried about crashing the haskell interpreter or the os
14:20:22 * lightstep is on linux
14:20:24 <shapr> It's really The System.
14:20:36 <shapr> Like, bureaucracy might come crumbling down!
14:20:48 <shapr> Whoa, I gotta sleep. I'm too silly.
14:21:20 <wagle> its got no way to crash linux
14:21:39 <wagle> and i can imagine lots of ways for things to possibly break
14:21:41 <shapr> It could, um, use a buffer overflow.
14:21:52 <lightstep> heh
14:22:22 <liquidengineer> Cale: any ideas?
14:23:14 <Cale> if you comment out update, it accepts those types for updateRecord and putRecordBack, right?
14:23:15 <basti_> liquidengineer: uhm well you were asking about "type"
14:23:15 <wagle> you are in trouble if you are afraid to experiment with something like fixIO (\str -> putStr str >> readLine)
14:23:17 <basti_> liquidengineer: with "data", of course, "deriving Show" will work
14:23:40 <basti_> brb
14:23:50 <Cale> basti_: it shouldn't even need Show
14:23:56 <liquidengineer> yeah
14:24:05 <liquidengineer> it loads into hugs just fine
14:24:10 <wagle> try it, see what happens, and see whether your changes to its code changes its behavior in the ways your expect
14:24:20 <liquidengineer> the showGbk function I have that converts the list of tuples to strings and prints them works great
14:24:37 <liquidengineer> it's just, it wants to show the gradebook it returns, for some reason
14:24:53 <Cale> what is the error you get?
14:24:57 <shapr> First time I got a hard drive, I booted it up with a new version of DOS, and I found this fdisk executable.
14:25:13 <shapr> I was like, 'partition? never heard of it, must not need it.'
14:25:19 <shapr> So I removed mine.
14:25:25 <Cale> hehe :)
14:25:48 <liquidengineer> *** Of type    : Gbk
14:25:48 <liquidengineer> Grades> myGbk
14:25:49 <liquidengineer> ERROR - Cannot find "show" function for:
14:25:49 <liquidengineer> *** Expression : myGbk
14:25:58 <shapr> See, that's a good way to learn about computers. When the magic falls out of the computer, you try to put it back in.
14:25:58 <liquidengineer> it does that when I just type in the name of my test Gbk variable, too
14:25:59 <Cale> oh
14:26:12 <liquidengineer> so it's not just the update thing
14:26:19 <Cale> liquidengineer: of course it wants to print it, so as to show you what the result was :)
14:26:19 <liquidengineer> it's something with Gbk
14:26:29 <liquidengineer> so what do I do?
14:27:07 <shapr> Of course, people consider many of my actions past the edge of insanely risky. But that's ok. It builds character. (read, is horribly painful, you won't do that again)
14:27:09 <Cale> what is the definition of Gbk?
14:27:19 <Cale> type Gbk = [(Name, Score, Score, Score, Total, Grade)] still?
14:27:29 <shapr> Right, I'm outta here. G'night.
14:27:32 <gzl> shapr: great, i think that worked, thanks. :)
14:27:35 <liquidengineer> yes
14:27:38 <shapr> gzl: awesome =)
14:27:39 <aheller> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
14:27:41 <Cale> and what are those types?
14:27:43 <aheller> ooops, sorry
14:27:45 <gzl> shapr: it's the nastiest type signature ever
14:27:49 <shapr> aheller: that's is SO X rated!
14:27:53 <shapr> gzl: and yet it works!
14:27:56 <gzl> shapr: yes :)
14:28:18 <Cale> (Name, Score, Total and Grade)
14:28:18 <shapr> gzl: if you want extra points, you can likely simplify the type sig. There are a lot of partially applied type aliases in WASH.
14:28:37 <shapr> Stuff like Parsec's 'Parser Char' which actually expands into something huge and nasty.
14:28:37 <liquidengineer> Cale: name is a String
14:28:40 <liquidengineer> Score is an int
14:28:49 <liquidengineer> Total is a float
14:28:55 <aheller> shapr: apparently Shift-X is very much like Ctl-Alt if you're not paying attention.
14:29:05 <liquidengineer> and Grade is an enumerated type
14:29:14 <liquidengineer> Grade can be either A B C D or F
14:29:34 <shapr> aheller: not on my keyboard - http://kinesis-ergo.com/images/500-blk.jpg
14:29:49 <shapr> Good night, don't let the side-effects bite
14:29:59 <Cale> liquidengineer: ah, I see
14:30:09 <gzl> well, I'll come back to cleaning up the code later, right now I just want it working
14:30:10 <Cale> it'd not automatically deriving show for tuples that large
14:30:11 <liquidengineer> does what I'm doing make sense to you?
14:30:19 <liquidengineer> ah
14:30:27 <Cale> it's*
14:30:36 <liquidengineer> so because I've got so many fields in each record, it won't automatically try to show it
14:30:42 <gzl> shapr: do you happen to know how to write an arbitrary link? something like (a (attr "href" "foo") (text "bar"))
14:30:51 <liquidengineer> even though it knows how to show every one of the types
14:31:06 <gzl> obviously it complains that this is applied to too many arguments
14:31:12 <gzl> i must be doing something stupid here
14:31:26 <liquidengineer> cause, Grade derives show
14:31:54 <liquidengineer> and it works cause I've tested it individually
14:32:02 <Cale> yeah
14:32:14 <gzl> hmm, maybe >>
14:32:15 <liquidengineer> so...what do I do?
14:32:20 <Cale> Show instances are apparently only defined up to 5-tuples
14:32:27 <gzl> yeah, I think >>
14:32:28 <Cale> you could add an extra one
14:32:49 <liquidengineer> extra one what?
14:32:54 <Cale> Show instance
14:33:08 <liquidengineer> I can't add a show instance for a type, can I?
14:33:13 <liquidengineer> I already tried that and it bit at me
14:35:43 <Cale> I made a Show instance for 6-tuples and put it on the pastepage
14:36:07 <Cale> you can add that to your code and it will be able to show them
14:36:49 <lightstep> you can't have both the automatically derived instance and a manually defined one
14:37:13 <liquidengineer> hmmmm
14:37:16 <liquidengineer> what is showsPrec?
14:37:40 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellNewbie_2fReadsAndShowsPrec
14:37:56 <lightstep> _2f ?
14:38:12 <Cale> yeah
14:38:17 <Cale> that's a slash in the wikiname
14:38:29 <lightstep> i thought that's what % is for
14:39:39 <liquidengineer> my God
14:39:41 <liquidengineer> it works
14:39:55 <liquidengineer> Would it be inappropriate to sqee now?
14:39:59 <liquidengineer> *squee
14:40:00 <basti_> liquidengineer: :)
14:40:04 <basti_> liquidengineer: what did you do?
14:40:09 <liquidengineer> Cale: thakns
14:40:16 <basti_> liquidengineer: sorry i had to help my s.o. with statistics exercises
14:40:19 <Cale> no problem
14:40:42 <liquidengineer> Cale showed me how to tell it how to print tuples that have more than five fields
14:40:49 <liquidengineer> that's a wierd sort of limit, actually
14:40:55 <liquidengineer> what keeps it from automatically doing more?
14:41:04 <Cale> nobody ever uses tuples that large anyway
14:41:07 <basti_> ahh =)
14:41:26 <Cale> If you have that many fields, use a data declaration :)
14:41:31 <basti_> cool.
14:41:31 <basti_> -g-
14:41:35 <lightstep> doesn't the standard say you have automatic instances for all of them?
14:41:42 * basti_ didnt know
14:41:49 <basti_> a sin!
14:42:00 <basti_> call the pope!
14:42:00 <basti_> oops
14:44:00 <Cale> It says that there should be Read and Show instances up to size 15
14:44:06 <lightstep> oh
14:44:23 <Cale> but the implementations tend to do size 5
14:44:55 <liquidengineer> ah
14:44:59 <liquidengineer> so, use data
14:44:59 <Cale> The most common cases are () and (a,b) anyway.
14:45:03 <Cale> yeah
14:45:12 <liquidengineer> problem being I don't know how to use data for anything desides enumerated types
14:45:27 <liquidengineer> we're sort of stuck in intro stuff
14:46:23 <basti_> aw data is easy
14:46:36 <basti_> it can make all sorts of types.
14:46:40 <basti_> trees, lists...
14:46:44 <basti_> graphs
14:46:50 <basti_> bizarros
14:46:58 <Cale> well, not graphs
14:47:08 <Cale> not directly anyway :)
14:47:08 <basti_> not directly no.
14:47:12 <basti_> right.
14:47:21 <liquidengineer> what is "shows?"
14:47:25 <basti_> but you can make data things go funny ways.
14:47:33 <basti_> uhm someone asked that.
14:47:35 <Cale> @type shows
14:47:41 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- shows :: forall a. (Show a) => a -> ShowS
14:47:49 <Cale> @info ShowS
14:47:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- Sorry, I don't know the command "info", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
14:47:56 <Cale> erm...
14:48:15 <Cale> type ShowS = String -> String
14:48:37 <liquidengineer> I'm confused
14:48:41 <liquidengineer> showS shows a string?
14:48:48 <basti_> < watching autopsy documentation with my gf
14:48:53 <basti_> shows is occult to arcane ;)
14:48:58 <basti_> no but not commonly used
14:49:21 <Cale> @plugs shows 5 "Hello"
14:49:26 <lightstep> shows x y == show x ++ y   but more efficient
14:49:26 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- "5Hello"
14:49:43 <liquidengineer> ooooh
14:49:49 <Cale> @plugs shows 5 . shows 6 . shows 7 ""
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- Couldn't match `a -> String' against `String'
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- 	Expected type: a -> String
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- 	Inferred type: String
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)-     Probable cause: `shows' is applied to too many arguments in the call
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- (shows 7 "")
14:49:50 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)-     In the second argument of `(.)', namely `shows 7 ""'
14:49:52 <liquidengineer> it concats and shows
14:49:59 <lightstep> @plugs shows 5 . shows 6 . shows 7 $ ""
14:50:00 <Cale> @plugs (shows 5 . shows 6 . shows 7) ""
14:50:01 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- "567"
14:50:01 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- "567"
14:50:51 <lightstep> the idea is that concatenation conses less when using (.) than when using (++)
15:02:28 <RemiTurk> hi everyone
15:02:58 <astrolabe> good evening
15:03:15 <liquidengineer> new question
15:03:21 <liquidengineer> update works fine
15:03:33 <liquidengineer> (I can tell now that, you know, I can see it's output)
15:03:41 <liquidengineer> it returns an updated gradebook
15:04:03 <liquidengineer> but it doesn't change the source gradebook
15:04:20 <liquidengineer> eg. if I call it with myGbk, it doesn't change myGbk
15:05:07 <liquidengineer> I would very much like it to change myGbk
15:05:28 <Cale> that would break the language :)
15:06:28 <RemiTurk> or you'll have to change myGbk
15:06:42 * RemiTurk hopes he doesn't say stupid things, falling in the middle of a discussion
15:06:48 <liquidengineer> myGbk = update ... errors
15:06:59 <RemiTurk> (I meant: change myGbk to some mutable state)
15:07:04 <Cale> = update what?
15:07:34 <liquidengineer> eg, if I try to assign myGbk the result of update, it errors on syntax
15:07:42 <liquidengineer> Java has rotted my brain for this kind of stuff
15:07:53 <liquidengineer> I'm used to passing objects as references
15:08:01 <Cale> there shouldn't be any problem with declaring myGbk to be an update of another
15:08:23 <Cale> but you should be aware that the = sign in Haskell means equality
15:08:37 <Cale> so that you could make the replacement one for the other either way
15:08:53 <liquidengineer> oh
15:08:55 <Cale> without changing the meaning
15:08:58 <liquidengineer> what's the assignment statement?
15:09:05 <liquidengineer> cause this doesn't work
15:09:07 <liquidengineer> Grades> myGbk = update 100 "Dick" One myGbk
15:09:08 <liquidengineer> ERROR - Syntax error in input (unexpected `=')
15:09:24 <Cale> oh, you can't make declarations at the hugs prompt anyway
15:09:26 <RemiTurk> there is no assignment statement
15:09:48 <RemiTurk> there are, however, functions which assign a new value to some mutable state
15:09:48 <liquidengineer> hmmm
15:09:54 <RemiTurk> (IORef, MVar etc)
15:10:13 <Cale> but you probably don't want those yet :)
15:10:22 <liquidengineer> Not really, no
15:10:24 * RemiTurk removes almost exactly the same sentence
15:10:27 <liquidengineer> I have an idea
15:10:51 <liquidengineer> I change the name of update to updateGradebook
15:10:51 <wagle> what is lambdabot's "pointless" transformation?
15:11:03 <Cale> @pointless \x y -> y x
15:11:04 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- flip id
15:11:12 <liquidengineer> than have update take all the arguments updateGradebook takes
15:11:29 <RemiTurk> cool (pointless, that is)
15:11:38 <liquidengineer> and have update do something like gradebook = updateGradebook (args)
15:11:45 <liquidengineer> would that work?
15:11:59 <Cale> liquidengineer: work in what sense?
15:12:00 <kuribas> Isn't it possible to put alternatives inside a patternmatching rule (like in ocaml)?
15:12:05 <Cale> what are you trying to do?
15:12:26 <liquidengineer> Cale
15:12:50 <liquidengineer> when I call my update function on myGbk, I want to assign the result to myGbk
15:13:07 <Cale> that doesn't make sense :)
15:13:09 <Cale> hehe
15:13:25 <liquidengineer> what do you mean?
15:13:31 <liquidengineer> it's be like in java saying:
15:13:53 <Cale> once you have declared myGbk, it is set in stone
15:13:59 <liquidengineer> gradebook = update(gradebook,name,newGrade,...)
15:14:08 <liquidengineer> oh
15:14:11 <liquidengineer> well then
15:14:16 <Cale> if you need it to be different in different circumstances, make it a function
15:14:46 <Cale> x = x + 1 is an infinite loop
15:14:52 * RemiTurk notes that Haskell is Very Good for Quantum Computing, as you can't destroy any (qu)bits
15:15:07 <RemiTurk> (which is of course also why darcs is written in haskell)
15:15:36 <RemiTurk> liquidengineer: do you have a snippet of the actual code online?
15:15:46 <wagle> garbage collector destroys
15:15:47 <RemiTurk> (HaskellIrcPaste or whatever)
15:15:52 <liquidengineer> yeah
15:15:55 <Cale> liquidengineer: so, what are you actually trying to compute?
15:15:55 <norpan> if you can't destroy the qubits how do you read the result
15:15:57 <liquidengineer> I put some stuff up on the paste page
15:15:58 <RemiTurk> wagle: but that's not observable :)
15:16:09 <wagle> sure it is
15:16:15 <Cale> assignment is usually a means and not an end
15:16:24 <wagle> not so directly, but you can make a covert channel
15:16:36 <epichrom> garbage collect destroys things you don't want to observe any more anyway.
15:16:40 <RemiTurk> norpan: well, I lied, reading does destroy them indeed. which is probably why I dropped out of that course a month ago ;)
15:16:53 <wagle> plus, memoization overwrites info
15:16:58 <Cale> liquidengineer: so what would you be using that variable assignment to accomplish?
15:17:09 <epichrom> Actually lazy evaluate gives another edge.  Things you don't observe probably won't be worked out.
15:17:33 <epichrom> (or worked out in a more efficient way)
15:17:41 <liquidengineer> cale: here's the def of update according to the teacher
15:17:45 <liquidengineer> Which updates a students score on an exam number and returns the updated grade book. The total and grade will be needed to be updated also. Total will always be the average grade from the exams, Grade will be determined by the following percentiles: 90 = A, 80=B,......
15:17:59 <liquidengineer> I guess I just sort of assumed it would alter the myGbk variable
15:17:59 <wagle> hmm
15:18:03 <Cale> yep, so what you wrote does that
15:18:09 <Cale> it doesn't
15:18:14 <Cale> myGbk is a constant
15:18:25 <liquidengineer> but it doesn't explicitly say it has to alter, so I guess I can't worry about it
15:18:26 <Cale> everything you declare is a constant
15:18:33 <xerox> wagle: @pointless points-frees the code.
15:18:36 <RemiTurk> hm, "returns the updated grade book" is a bit ambiguous
15:18:54 <Cale> it's not that ambiguous :)
15:19:01 <wagle> xerox: yeah, i know.. i wanted to know what it did when it did that
15:19:18 <wagle> @pointless \f -> flip (f . flip ($))
15:19:20 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- flip . (. flip id)
15:19:36 <Cale> it returns the new gradebook, after the update
15:19:36 <wagle> like that ^^^
15:19:41 <RemiTurk> well, it could either return a new gradebook or return a reference to the altered one
15:19:57 * RemiTurk rereads the quote
15:20:04 <liquidengineer> Cale: like I said, Java's poisoned my brain
15:20:16 <norpan> sounds like that discussion is out of scope for his assignment, obviously it should return a new gradebook
15:20:20 <liquidengineer> I'm used to using methods to change their arguments
15:20:39 <liquidengineer> I've gotta go now
15:20:44 <Cale> see you
15:20:49 <liquidengineer> I have a mess of sorts to write
15:20:51 <liquidengineer> yay
15:21:00 <liquidengineer> one more set of functions and this assignment is done
15:21:01 <wagle> liquidengineer: your brain should get flexible enough to contain java, and several other approaches to programming
15:21:10 <liquidengineer> wagle: I realize that
15:21:17 <liquidengineer> and I think it will.
15:21:21 <RemiTurk> good luck liquidengineer then
15:21:22 <Cale> It just takes some stretching :)
15:21:26 <liquidengineer> but the Java stuff is more firmly implanted
15:21:27 <wagle> liquidengineer: have fun
15:21:32 <liquidengineer> I've been doing Java for years
15:21:33 <norpan> yeah, the brain is made of soft stuff
15:21:41 <liquidengineer> I've only been doing Haskell four months
15:21:47 <liquidengineer> really only three months
15:22:05 <RemiTurk> norpan: I'm not sure, I don't know whether it's a random assignment which liquidengineer happens to want to do in haskell or an actual haskell assignment
15:22:28 <liquidengineer> It's taking me a while to change how I think about things
15:22:36 <norpan> either way it's easier to return a new one :)
15:22:49 <CosmicRay> liquidengineer: excellent
15:22:54 <liquidengineer> norPAN: I'll bet
15:23:09 <liquidengineer> excellent?
15:23:20 <liquidengineer> I come in here asking newbie questions every few days....
15:23:24 <CosmicRay> liquidengineer: excellent that it's changing how you think about things
15:23:27 <liquidengineer> I feel like a moron
15:23:29 <liquidengineer> oh
15:23:32 <liquidengineer> yeah
15:23:41 <CosmicRay> liquidengineer: or at least showing you other ways to think of things, rather
15:24:00 <liquidengineer> I can program in python easier than I can program in Java, but I think that's cause the langauge is nicer
15:24:17 <liquidengineer> not easier....with less code to get the same work done
15:24:23 <liquidengineer> they're still both imperative
15:24:35 <CosmicRay> yes, I come from a python background
15:24:37 <CosmicRay> I agree
15:24:41 <wagle> languages for short programs are different that those for large programs
15:24:58 <norpan> they are?
15:24:59 <CosmicRay> wagle: the nice thing about haskell is that is works well for both
15:25:16 * RemiTurk remembers Pythoneers saying exactly the same about Python ;)
15:25:53 <wagle> CosmicRay: having to put programs in files is kinda heavy weight, but i see your point
15:25:56 <norpan> i'd say poorly designed languages are different than well designed languages :)
15:26:12 <norpan> where else would you put your program?
15:26:14 <wagle> haskell's got warts
15:26:20 <RemiTurk> certainly
15:26:25 <wagle> read-eval-print loop
15:26:26 <RemiTurk> all programming languages suck
15:26:30 <RemiTurk> haskell just sucks less
15:26:33 <RemiTurk> ;)
15:26:35 <wagle> RemiTurk: heh
15:26:46 <CosmicRay> sounds like remiturk has been hanging around me too much :-)
15:27:00 <RemiTurk> and I really hope that haskell 3000^H^H^H^H2 will suck even less
15:27:06 <SamB> I would say that haskell sucks in different ways
15:27:10 * RemiTurk doesn't get it
15:27:20 <wagle> a programming language has to suck to take over the world, though
15:27:26 * RemiTurk thinks it has a lot to do with his reading mutt's manual
15:28:03 <RemiTurk> wagle: a man can hope
15:28:35 <kuribas> Java was made to suck less, but still enough to be used by the mass
15:28:54 <CosmicRay> ironically, it manged to suck just enough more to be popular with managers :-)
15:30:22 <norpan> jdk 5 sucks even less; maybe that's why we're not allowed to use it
15:30:31 <CosmicRay> heh
15:31:38 <wagle> europeans brought guns to japan in the early 1600's.  after 50 years or so, the samurai banned guns (until the late 1800's) because they permitted a peasant, with only a few weeks of training, to kill a samurai who had trained all his life
15:33:09 <wagle> easy to use languages dont provide job security?
15:34:19 * RemiTurk has problems with that "easy to use"
15:35:05 <mwc> Hmm, I'm reading something in this doc: Because whitespace matters in Haskell, you need to be careful about whether you are using tabs or spaces. If you can configure your editor to never use tabs, that?s probably better. If not, make sure your tabs are always 8 spaces long, or you?re likely to run in to problems.
15:35:33 <mwc> Wouldn't tabs be preferred to spaces? Or should I be using softtabs?
15:36:00 <wagle> there is a culture of "gcc hacker" consultants.  they tend to not write documentation because reducing the barrier to entry would produce more competition
15:36:29 <RemiTurk> why would tabs be preferred?
15:37:25 <astrolabe> spaces have the advantage, that they won't trip up someone using an unprepared editor.
15:40:23 <wagle> expanding tabs to 8 spaces doesnt use that much additional space
15:40:45 <wagle> i do see that the hugs prelude has a number of tabs in it, though
15:43:34 <wagle> ..  of course, hacking gcc got so hard, that they had to do something about it
15:47:46 * RemiTurk thinks it's bedtime
15:48:15 <RemiTurk> goodnight everyone
15:48:26 <wagle> gnight
15:52:27 <wagle> there's a ghc 6.5?
15:53:25 <wagle> (darwinport's ghc-devel is marked 6.5..  must be a typo?)
15:53:36 <Lemmih> 6.5 == CVS HEAD.
15:54:00 <wagle> o_O
15:54:11 <wagle> hopefully he didnt go that bleeding edge
15:56:05 <Khisanth> -devel does not mean the indevelopment version? :)
15:56:28 <wagle> development environment.  (in this case, the compiler)
15:57:03 <wagle> oh wait
15:57:25 <wagle> hahah..  that's fink's defn..  darwinport's uses your defn
15:58:49 <wagle> Khisanth: thanks for making me look again
16:00:19 <Khisanth> well I think most people are less confusing about these things and just use -cvs or -svn
16:41:23 * Lemmih wonders why Foreign.ForeignPtr.finalizeForeignPtr isn't available in Hugs.

18:13:51 <dons> moin
18:14:27 <Lemmih> Morning, dons.
18:15:01 <dons> hey Lemmih
18:15:24 <Lemmih> What's up?
18:16:15 <dons> coffee and lambdabot patches :)
18:16:32 <dons> part of a complete breakfast
18:18:26 <Lemmih> I'll send you a hackage module once Hackage gets a permanent home.
18:19:06 <dons> cool. that would be useful.
19:13:13 <dons> quote on darcs ml:
19:13:13 <dons> Between darcs and Pugs (prototype Perl 6 compiler) and a couple friends and
19:13:13 <dons> meaning for a long time to learn functional programming, I'm convinced
19:13:14 <dons> about Haskell.
19:14:02 <dons> looks like apps is how you get converts
19:22:40 <Khisanth> dons: no better way to show what can be done :)
19:23:26 <mwc> dons, hehehe, that's about the number one way to attract developers
19:24:11 <dons> yep. seems so. years of having cool abstractions didn't do as much as a new rcs and a perl implementation.
19:24:16 <dons> :)
19:24:25 <stepcut> just wait till they see yi ;p
19:24:46 <dons> yeah! needs more hackers. I can't work on it full time.
19:24:55 <mwc> I find that Haskell is a nicer functional langauge than say Scheme or OCaml just because it feels more purely mathematical
19:25:10 <mwc> I'm an applied mathematician so that's why this seems natural to me
19:25:27 <stepcut> my last big (known) deadlines are on the 15 and 17 of this month -- I hope to do hack on the Yi emacs keybindings for a bit after that
19:25:43 * dons law of language success: you must write an RCS, a perl implementation, and an emacs replacement
19:25:45 <mwc> what's Yi?
19:25:49 <mwc> Oooh
19:26:16 <dons> possibly a python impl would work too.
19:26:32 <dons> cool. Yi patches are very welcome.
19:26:59 <mwc> dons, how does it work for haskell code?
19:27:05 <Khisanth> dons: well the fact that the rcs and perl implementations are better than the current ones doesn't hurt
19:27:05 <mwc> right now that is
19:27:30 <dons> atm, it uses hs-plugins to dynamically compile and load haskell modules on the fly
19:27:33 <dons> like @plugs
19:27:34 <mwc> Khisanth, what's the deal with the Perl6 compiler, are they writing it in Perl6 or what?
19:27:53 <dons> @plugs sort "haskell for everyone!"
19:27:55 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- "  !aeeeefhkllnoorrsvy"
19:27:55 <Khisanth> that is the plan
19:28:15 <Khisanth> but of course you need perl6 to write a perl 6 compiler in perl 6!
19:28:28 <dons> i personally think it's crazy to write a compiler in perl, but I understand that all languages need to be self-hosting
19:28:43 <Pseudonym> C++ doesn't have a Perl implementation.  Well, not a complete one, anyway.
19:28:51 <mwc> dons, I personally think it's madness to write in perl, so what can you do
19:29:33 <mwc> I doon't think Java has an RCS
19:29:36 <mwc> There's Jython
19:29:40 <mwc> but no RCS afaik
19:29:48 <epichrom> if you're mad enough to write in perl, surely you're mad enough to write everything too.
19:29:57 <dons> ok, try again: 1. A popular scripting language must be implemented. 2. should be self-hosting
19:29:58 <Pseudonym> Sadly I only wrote diff in Mercury.  I never wrote the rest of the RCS.
19:30:19 <Kkaa> RCS?
19:30:32 <mwc> Oh well, I fixed my layout problem so I'm off
19:30:56 <dons>        Walter  F.  Tichy,  RCS--A  System  for  Version  Control,
19:30:56 <dons>        Software--Practice   &   Experience  15,  7  (July  1985),
19:30:56 <dons>        637-654.
19:31:04 <dons> hehe. RCS=revision control system
19:31:29 <dons> there was an early system called rcs that's still around
19:31:41 <Pseudonym> cvs was originally a set of shell scripts on top of rcs
19:32:05 <dons> which explains a lot.
19:32:18 * dons is spoiled by darcs
19:33:06 <Pseudonym> I need to port my Mercury diff algorithm over to darcs some time.
19:33:09 <Pseudonym> It's REALLY fast.
19:33:21 <autrijus> faster than xdelta, or is that apple/orange?
19:33:34 <Pseudonym> No idea.
19:34:18 <autrijus> ok. because svn has just switched to xdelta :)
19:34:34 <autrijus> dons: writing a compiler in perl5 is an exercise in madness itself.
19:34:54 <dons> yeah true. p6 is a different language entirely.
19:34:55 <autrijus> perl6 however is another matter.
19:35:11 * autrijus was trying to formulate GADTs in p6 the other day
19:35:15 <dons> hehe!
19:35:18 <autrijus> doesn't seem to be too difficult.
19:35:41 <Pseudonym> Looking at docs, Xdelta is noticably slower on text than diff, but MUCH faster on binary.
19:35:51 <Pseudonym> That's unsurprising.
19:36:59 <Khisanth> autrijus: what does svk use?
19:37:23 <autrijus> Khisanth: svk uses whatever the underlying svn uses
19:37:28 <autrijus> so, soon to be xdelta
19:38:03 * Khisanth patiently waits for svk in Perl6 ;)
19:38:12 <autrijus> it will come :)
19:38:41 <Khisanth> hopefully sooner rather than later
19:39:35 <Pseudonym> Lunch.

20:24:35 <autrijus> just extract, perl Makefile.PL, make test, and see if it passes
20:27:32 <cm> autrijus: hold on
20:28:20 <cm> agh, wrong GHC version =(
20:28:24 <autrijus> :(
20:28:27 <autrijus> sorry, 6.4
20:29:00 <cm> bed time, then :) nites

20:42:54 <stepcut> so... the alarm clock on my cell phone stopped working a few weeks ago
20:43:16 <stepcut> but now, starting at 8:40pm, it has been going off every minute, even though it is not set...
20:43:43 <dons> autrijus: OpenBSD 3.6 i386, looks good here. though:
20:43:45 <dons> t/1-basic....ok
20:43:45 <dons>         1/21 skipped: skip this test for now, 1/21 unexpectedly succeeded
20:43:45 <dons> All tests successful (1 subtest UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED), 1 subtest skipped.
20:43:45 <dons> Files=1, Tests=21,  1 wallclock secs ( 1.49 cusr +  0.02 csys =  1.51 CPU)
20:43:47 <dons> gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/Perl6-Pugs-6.0.14/ext/Test'
20:43:50 <stepcut> they must have gotten the intern to write the alarm clock :-/
20:44:10 <autrijus> which test is that unexpectedly succeeded one?
20:44:15 <autrijus> oh, 1-basic
20:44:19 <autrijus> can you run
20:44:57 <autrijus> ./pugs -Iext/Test/lib ./ext/Test/t/1-basic.t
20:45:58 <autrijus> and look for an "ok" that is followdd by "# TODO" ?
20:46:25 <dons> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/f
20:46:46 <autrijus> got it
20:49:39 <dons> pugs needs a ghc -M style build system, it'd handle -jN then.
20:49:51 <autrijus> elaborate?
20:49:59 <autrijus> or, urls?
20:50:01 <autrijus> I'd be thrilled to add it
20:50:14 <dons> ok. maybe have a look at Yi or lambdabot.
20:50:30 <dons> using ghc -M, ghc writes a Makefile fragment for you
20:50:35 <dons> specifying the dependencies
20:50:42 <dons> then you can toss out --make
20:50:51 <autrijus> ok
20:50:51 <dons> and just let gnu make handle the deps
20:51:05 <dons> which means faster turn around, and -jN works for free
20:51:18 <autrijus> okie.
20:51:24 <autrijus> didn't know that :)
20:51:26 <autrijus> thanks!
20:51:37 <dons> $(GHC) -cpp $(HC_OPTS) $(PKG_OPTS) -M -optdep-f  -optdepdepend $(ALL_SRCS)
20:51:43 <dons> would be the 'depend' rule
20:51:58 <dons> and the main Makefile would: -include depend
20:52:27 <dons> darcs also uses this system
20:52:43 <autrijus> k

23:14:48 <desrt> ah.  it's everything.
23:14:53 <dons> means runplugs got compiled with 6.4 by some mistake
23:15:06 <dons> try that.
23:15:12 <desrt> @plugs head (iterate pred 2)

23:15:18 <desrt> excellent.
23:15:24 <dons> quick fix department!
23:16:33 <desrt> (product . takeWhile (> 0) . iterate pred)
23:17:29 <desrt> pointless factorial.  exciting.
23:26:07 <desrt> there's all these strange haskell/generally-smart-people lingo things that i wish i knew more about
23:26:19 <desrt> like i know what pointless is, but i don't know why it's called that
23:27:21 <shapr> points-free ?
23:27:38 <desrt> functions like this: (product . takeWhile (> 0) . iterate pred)
23:27:57 <desrt> as opposed to ones like \n -> product [1..n]
23:28:01 <dons> there's a common joke that pointfree style is pointless
23:28:15 <desrt> ah.  so it's actually called points-free?
23:28:46 <gzl> hey, shapr. you got a minute for another quick question?
23:29:25 <shapr> gzl: not really, but I might have time in an hour. You can ask, I'll respond if/when I can.
23:29:38 <gzl> that's ok, i'm going to bed in a few minutes, i'll just ask tomorrow.
23:29:41 <gzl> thanks though.
23:32:36 <dons> yay. got profiling working on the bot.
23:32:47 <dons> now, to bring down that memory footprint
23:35:11 <wilx`> How much does it occupy now?
23:35:34 <dons> on startup it sits at around 13M on my box
23:35:43 <wilx`> Hmm, that doesn't sound too bad.
23:36:27 <dons> I think it can do better. Yi is much smaller than that, and yet maintains large buffers.
23:36:47 <dons> the lambdabot state isn't so large. so I wonder where it's all going
23:36:55 <dons> s/isn't/shouldn't be/
23:37:24 <dons> anyway, profiling is very useful. it's good to know when you're killing performance, and how.
23:41:58 <Khisanth> hrm so ... anyone here using 6.4 on gentoo?
23:44:04 <wilx> I see.
23:45:00 <ozone> desrt: points are arguments to functions
23:45:13 <ozone> why they're called points, i don't know :)
23:45:27 <ozone> but that explains quite a lot more about why it's called "point-free style"
23:45:39 <desrt> that's a depressingly simple explanation :(
23:45:45 <desrt> thanks :)
23:46:14 <ozone> i read about it in some yampa paper, and went "aaaaaaah"
23:46:42 <desrt> @static
23:46:43 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- Sorry, I don't know the command "static", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
23:46:46 <dons> @version
23:46:47 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- lambdabot 2p116, GHC 6.4 (OpenBSD i386)
23:46:47 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
23:47:06 <dons> it has to be rebooted if I mess with the non-dynamic section of lambdabot
23:47:15 <desrt> nod
23:47:27 <desrt> i had an ircd like that
23:47:51 <wilx> OT: Do all BSD's use the same ports system and the same stupid Ruby portupgrade port that keeps segfaulting on me for quite some time now?
23:47:53 <desrt> it was neat.  *all* state was explicitly tracked
23:48:05 <desrt> so you could unload/reload the entire ircd without losing state/dropping connections
23:48:13 <desrt> unless, of course, you wanted to change the code that handled that stuff
23:48:50 <desrt> wilx; don't bother with portupgrade
23:49:08 <desrt> wilx; i find the most effective solution is to delete all the packages once per year or so and reinstall them fresh
23:49:17 <wilx> :)
23:49:26 <desrt> dead serious.  this is how i handle my freebsd box
23:49:37 <dons> yeah. in Yi the dynamic part is 148/5282 loc.
23:49:43 <wilx> Do you mean the /var/db thingy (or what was the dir...)?
23:49:45 <dons> sorry other way around
23:49:51 <desrt> dons; that's cool.
23:49:58 <dons> 148 lo static code vs 5282 lines of dyn code
23:50:02 <desrt> wilx; /var/db/pkg?
23:50:11 <wilx> Yeah, that's it.
23:50:35 <desrt> i usually go in there and pkg_delete *
23:50:40 <dons> and 4774 lo comments.
23:50:49 <wilx> I see.
23:50:49 <dons> damn, my comment ratio is slipping
23:50:53 <wilx> Will think about it.
23:50:57 <desrt> hmm
23:51:01 * desrt installs darcs
23:51:17 <desrt> wow.  that was easy.
23:51:19 <desrt> @version
23:51:19 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- lambdabot 2p116, GHC 6.4 (OpenBSD i386)
23:51:19 -lambdabot(~lambdabot@manzano.cse.unsw.EDU.AU)- darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/lambdabot
23:51:26 <desrt> s/lambdabot/yi/, right?
23:51:29 <dons> yep.
23:51:43 <dons> you need hs-plugins, or just build: make way=static
23:51:52 <dons> if you're just trying it out.
23:51:53 <desrt> static sounds fine to me
23:52:12 <desrt> shouldn't Way be capitalised? :)
23:52:37 <dons> you might want --partial, btw
23:52:45 <dons> s/might/do/
23:52:46 <desrt> what does it do?
23:53:04 <desrt> what does it might?
23:53:05 <dons> does'nt retrieve the entire patch history, just since the last tag
23:53:17 <desrt> it's already done
23:53:19 <dons> so you download maybe 3 patches instead of 303.
23:53:26 <dons> ok. bandwidth boy.
23:53:33 <wilx> Does Cabal allow things like installation of my app to supplied prefix and such?
23:53:37 <desrt> Imk...
23:53:58 <desrt> apt has never heard of it
23:54:16 <desrt> oh.  i'm not trying hard enough.  nm
23:55:29 <desrt> mm.  that was an esay build.  good sign :)
23:55:39 <dons> cool.
23:55:46 <vegai> desrt: yi?
23:55:49 <desrt> yes
23:55:56 <vegai> what are you building it on, 6.2?
23:56:02 <desrt> The "syntax on" command is unknown.
23:56:04 <desrt> pfft!
23:56:08 <desrt> 622
23:56:08 <dons> sorry :}
23:56:13 <vegai> ok
23:56:18 <desrt> not bad
23:56:28 <dons> :sp
23:56:36 <desrt> pretty colours
23:56:41 <desrt> that's all i really care about
23:56:45 <vegai> me wanna screenshot!
23:57:02 <vegai> pretty please?
23:57:02 <dons> well, it looks like vim with :syntax off
23:57:12 * vegai imagines.
23:57:16 <dons> or, in nano mode is looks a bit more like nano
23:57:30 <desrt> http://manic.desrt.ca/yi-ss.png
23:57:50 <vegai> ah, indeed :)
23:58:12 <desrt> sorry.  couldn't think of anything more exciting to type :)
23:58:43 <desrt> hm.  the semantics of ^W are a bit different in yi than vi
23:58:51 <desrt> i sort of prefer yi
23:59:18 <dons> yeah, that's from vim, rather than vi I think.
23:59:28 <dons> (it runs vi + some vim by default)
23:59:29 <desrt> s/vi$/vim/
23:59:41 <dons> yi --as=vi gives you supposed-to-be standard vi
23:59:43 <desrt> ya.  vi on its own is pretty desolate
