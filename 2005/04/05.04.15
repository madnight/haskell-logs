00:00:33 <boegel> hey Oejet
00:00:43 <Gahhh> some fields are just more demonstrative, though. You can be a child genius mathematician, chess player, musician, etc. Not true for many other fields.
00:00:50 <mwc> With mathematics, you really do build your theories on top of what happened, whereas with physics the major revolutions tend to bulldoze the preceeding theories, that was my point. Mathematics still uses theorems from Euclid. Modern physics doesn't recognize newtonian mech as anything but a simple degeneration of GR at sufficiently slow speeds and low masses
00:00:59 <mwc> that was my point
00:01:18 <Gahhh> mwc: I agree with you. I was agreeing with you earlier too anyways
00:01:19 <mwc> I'm sure GR and Quantum mech are both due to me tossed out the window shortly too
00:01:45 <tuomov> in a sense physics does build on what came before.. your models still need to approximate the older theories
00:02:04 <mwc> Gahhh, I built a potato cannon at age 7 and was "detained" by the police department
00:02:04 <mwc> what does that qualify as ;)
00:02:09 <Gahhh> no, it is more like backwards compatibility
00:02:52 <mwc> physics prodigee?
00:02:53 <mwc> A physics prodigee is probably identified as a delinquent and sent to councilling
00:03:10 <mwc> same with the kids who start fires... chemistry prodigees
00:03:41 <blackdog> mwc: you could say that maths starts correct and moves to being complete, where physics starts complete and moves to being correct...
00:03:49 <mwc> blackdog, haha, I like that
00:04:15 <blackdog> i ripped it off paul graham. :)
00:04:29 <mwc> Ah
00:04:40 <Gahhh> yeah I was suspicious. "how could blackdog say this sorta stuff when SLEEPY???"
00:04:55 <blackdog> he was saying that programmers start original and get good, where scientists start good and get original
00:05:02 <mwc> What was it? LISP starts correct and becomes complete, C starts complete and moves to being correct?
00:05:04 <blackdog> I'm not sleepy, dammit.
00:05:29 <mwc> heh
00:05:35 <blackdog> it's only 5pm here, and my boss wants to celebrate his furchtbar candy, so we're going to the pub...
00:05:49 <Gahhh> oh sorry
00:05:51 <Cale> mwc: C is moving towards being correct?
00:06:05 <mwc> Cale, yeah, as in, you can do a lot of things that you shouldn't do
00:06:06 <Gahhh> C is moving ?
00:06:22 <Cale> well, it's not correct :)
00:06:24 <mwc> so programmers tend to use idioms like RAII to make sure things work correctly
00:06:30 <segphault> Gahhh: hahaha
00:06:34 <mwc> although RAII is a C++ idiom
00:07:36 <Cale> Gahhh: well, there's C99 :)
00:07:53 <mwc> Scheme especially is correct and then you have to get all the tuff you need to make it really usable
00:07:57 <Gahhh> Cale: You talk about 1999 in the simple present ? ;)
00:08:04 <mwc> C has all sort of damage and you need to make it correct
00:08:08 <mwc> I think it's a great analogy
00:08:25 <mwc> and I hereby disclaim all copyright
00:08:27 <Cale> Gahhh: I'm in mathematics - anything in the last century or so is recent :)
00:08:32 <Cale> heh
00:08:38 <mwc> Cale, hah
00:08:40 <Gahhh> Cale: Have you not graduated yet ?
00:08:44 <mwc> last century!
00:08:48 <Cale> Gahhh: not quite
00:09:07 <Cale> plan to graduate this summer
00:09:30 * mwc shudders to imagine a world without QM and in SR will be published later this year
00:09:44 <Gahhh> QM = ?
00:09:52 <Gahhh> quantum mech ?
00:09:57 <mwc> yeah
00:10:05 <mwc> and all the quantum models under it
00:10:19 <mwc> At this time 100 years ago, we had a complete model of the universe that just needed a few loose ends tied up
00:10:39 <Gahhh> the quantum stuff goes over my head. I am an amish when it comes modern physics.
00:11:22 <mwc> Gahhh, quantum mech was created by applied mathematicians so that higher linear algebra would be useful ;)
00:11:29 <segphault> everything I know about quantum mechanics... I learned from Star Trek! ;-D
00:12:05 <Cale> There has to be some reason to talk about simultaneously diagonalisable matrices :)
00:12:34 <Cale> not to mention functional analysis
00:12:35 <mwc> I'm sure there's a use for that, after all , Hilbert space is a VERY big space
00:13:31 <Cale> some Hilbert spaces are
00:14:04 * mwc considers blowing some compsci minds
00:14:07 <Cale> the zero vector space qualifies as a Hilbert space though :)
00:14:14 <mwc> Cale, that it does
00:14:27 <Cale> separable too :)
00:14:30 <mwc> granted, it's empty
00:14:36 <mwc> hello, photon?!
00:14:38 <Cale> well, it's got that one point
00:15:00 <pesco> Yeah, what's it called again...
00:15:12 <Cale> nonseparable Hilbert spaces ought to be fun
00:15:29 <boegel> bye :)
00:16:11 <mwc> I love how a 500 qubit computer manipulates more information than is thermodynamically possible to do classicaly with the entire universe's resources
00:17:07 <Gahhh> What's a 500 qubit computer ? a quantum computer that may exist ?
00:17:22 <mwc> we've built simple quantum computers, 7 qubits or so
00:17:41 <mwc> you use superposition of quantum states to do ridiculous feats of parallel computing, essentially
00:18:33 <Gahhh> what limits the amount of parallelism ?
00:18:42 <Cale> number of qubits
00:18:44 <mwc> essentially a 500 qubit computer has 2^500 state vectors, and you can have a state which is a superposition of any of them
00:20:14 <mwc> if you have the states |0> and |1> for a single qubit, in a quantum sense, you can have any state | psi > = a |0> + b |1> where ||a|| + ||b|| = 1
00:20:24 <mwc> as opposed to being in either 0 or 1
00:21:08 <mwc> of course, that information isn't directly recoverable, observation leads to collapse to either 0 or 1
00:22:00 <mwc> there are three things we know a quantum computer can do vastly better than a classical computer
00:22:11 <mwc> a) compute factors of a number
00:22:17 <mwc> b) compute the discreete logarithm
00:22:23 <mwc> c) search unordered data
00:22:28 <Gahhh> so you do all that parallel computing but you can't get the results out ?
00:22:31 <Cale> There's still lots of work to be done in finding good quantum algorithms though.
00:22:39 <mwc> Gahhh, not really
00:22:53 <mwc> what you can do is "compute" and then eventually you get a result
00:23:14 <mwc> that result is "probably" the correct answer
00:23:30 <mwc> quantum computers aren't deterministic
00:23:30 <Gahhh> I see, so the threads need to converge to produce a single result
00:23:35 <mwc> exactly
00:23:51 <mwc> like if you wanted to extract factors of a massive number, the answer you'd get is probably a factor
00:24:04 <mwc> that's best checked by doing the division which is easy
00:24:12 <Gahhh> Cale: arent't there non-deterministic algorithms for the np- problems ?
00:24:26 <Cale> what is the runtime of factorisation on a quantum computer?
00:24:51 <mwc> Cale, not sure, depends on the actual implementation
00:25:06 <Cale> Gahhh: NP means computable in polynomial time on a non-deterministic turing machine.
00:25:36 <Gahhh> Cale: I know that. I thought the algorithms existed beyond being just "computable".
00:26:10 <Cale> well, yeah, usually you show something is in NP by giving an algorithm
00:26:41 <mwc> Here we are
00:26:42 <Itkovian> meuning
00:26:49 <Gahhh> I should get a quantum computer and set up an e-commerce site with java and mysql... ;)
00:26:58 <mwc> Shors algo is O((log N)^3) for time
00:27:08 <Cale> nice :)
00:27:33 <mwc> and does it in O(log N) space
00:29:48 <Gahhh> I suppose when quantum computers arrive we have to ditch current encryption methods ?
00:29:58 <mwc> Gahhh, yeah
00:30:15 <Gahhh> ok I scrap the e-commerce website idea
00:30:16 <mwc> but don't worry, QM has an answer already
00:30:16 <mwc> just use quantum encryption
00:30:21 <mwc> which decays to nonsense if somebody
00:30:25 <mwc> eavesdrops
00:30:55 <Gahhh> so you can DoS transactions by obvserving them. heh.
00:31:17 <mwc> Gahhh, or you can just jam the channel :P
00:31:25 <mwc> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography
00:32:20 <mflux> doesn't 'quantum cryptography' basically require you to have a dedicated fiber from point a to point b?
00:32:46 <mwc> mflux, yeah, essentially
00:32:53 <mwc> or a pair of entangled particles
00:33:17 <mwc> you can use that to create a one time key
00:33:19 <mwc> and the use classical crypto on that
00:33:21 <mwc> a one time pad is also unbreakable
00:35:25 <Lemmih> Is there an easy way to find the code of prim ops in GHC?
00:37:20 <ozone> dons: me, silly?  never
00:37:58 <KrispyKringle> wow. it actually compiles.
00:38:05 <KrispyKringle> ill bet anyone here $5 it doesn't work.
00:38:21 <ozone> Lemmih: hs-plugins can load modules compiled with -fvia-c, that is correct
00:38:26 <KrispyKringle>  holy cow!
00:38:33 <ozone> what is not working is _dynamically loaded_ modules with -fvia-c
00:38:41 <ozone> i.e. .so files, _not_ .o files
00:38:46 <ozone> see the hawiki page on DynamicLinkingInGhc
00:38:56 <ozone> and read wolfgang's summary of what works on x86 and what doesn't
00:40:04 <Lemmih> ozone: Why on earth are you talking about .so files?
00:42:02 <ozone> because that's what an apache module is
00:43:31 <musasabi> if it is not haskell you could do evil things.
00:43:56 <musasabi> dlopen - but very unportable and probably just shooting yourself in the foot.
00:45:36 <Lemmih> ozone: Did wolfgang hack dynamic linking in ghc 6.2.2?
00:46:06 <ozone> Lemmih: it may or may not have worked in 6.2.2
00:46:20 <ozone> depending on what platform you're on, and what phase of the moon it is :)
00:46:33 <Cale> http://www.iqc.ca/science/ -- appears my uni does a bunch of quantum computing research.
00:46:48 <ozone> as i said before, i loaded up some .so files successfully with RuntimeLoader (hs-plugins's very, very, very primitive predecessor) a long time ago, and it worked sometimes
00:47:09 <Lemmih> ozone: And it would definitely fail with -fvia-c?
00:47:47 <ozone> i dunno
00:48:11 <ozone> dynamic linking pre-6.4 is pretty undefined
00:48:26 <ozone> though there was some old versqion (version 4?) of ghc which worked with dynamic linking on windows
00:48:31 <Lemmih> For me, dynamic linking == '-optl -shared'.
00:49:27 <ozone> as i said, see the wiki page
00:50:12 <Lemmih> I'm not using -dynamic nor -fPIC.
00:50:42 <ozone> have fun exploring the territories of the unknown, then :)
00:51:13 * Lemmih wonders why it worked so well.
00:51:50 <ozone> all i'm saying is that pre-6.4, how well dynamic linking works is undefined
00:51:57 <ozone> if it works for you, woot
00:52:01 <ozone> if not, well, there you go
00:55:16 <ozone> Lemmih: ah cool, just found your HaskellMod
00:55:22 <ozone> well, hopefully that'll fit graham's uses
00:55:45 <Lemmih> It probably wont if it's as unstable as you say.
00:56:50 <ozone> welp, can't hurt to try.  and as of 6.4, it looks like it'll work
00:57:32 <Lemmih> Does GHC interpret linker flags?
00:58:02 <ozone> -optl stuff, you mean?  i don't think so, but not 100% sure
00:59:00 <Itkovian> @seen shapr
00:59:01 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell. Last spoke 1 hour 21 minutes 1 second ago.
00:59:06 <Itkovian> well now
00:59:27 <Itkovian> Anybody familiar with the 'Arrows and Computation' paper by Ross Paterson?
00:59:59 * Lemmih still doesn't understand why dynamic linking would be a problem.
01:00:22 <Lemmih> It's not like I'm dynamically loading a Haskell library.
01:01:41 <ozone> Lemmih: if you're using hs-plugins to load .o's, i'm pretty sure you'll have hs-plugins code compiled into the .so, which may cause problems
01:02:02 <Lemmih> How so?
01:03:00 <ozone> that's part of the problem: pre-6.4, i dunno whether haskell code can be executed from a dynamically loaded library
01:03:08 <ozone> whether it's explicitly linked, or dlopen()ed
01:03:18 <ozone> due to e.g. PIC
01:03:22 <ozone> and relocation tables
01:03:28 <ozone> and all that other magic dynamic linker voodoo
01:05:21 <Lemmih> Any got a non-x86 machine where I can get a shell account?
01:05:33 * shapr shoots an arrow at Itkovian 
01:05:42 * Itkovian ducks
01:05:50 <shapr> missed again
01:06:02 * Itkovian takes his D20 and rolls ...
01:06:33 <shapr> What's the THAC0 of a fifth level FP programmer?
01:06:38 <Itkovian> say, shapr, in the paterson article ... isn't there a type missing on the first page?, i.e. the return type?
01:06:46 <Itkovian> 12
01:06:56 <shapr> @dice 1d20
01:06:56 <lambdabot> 1d20 => 20
01:06:59 <Lemmih> Oh well, working on x86 linux boxes is good enough.
01:07:05 <shapr> oh, critical hit!
01:07:13 <Itkovian> @dice 1d20
01:07:14 <lambdabot> 1d20 => 17
01:07:21 <shapr> He saves!
01:07:30 <Itkovian> heh, I'll use this for tonights AD&D session ;-)
01:07:39 <shapr> What was that, savings throw against arrows?
01:08:02 <Itkovian> You will not hit this monk my friend
01:09:07 <shapr> Where's the missing type?
01:09:33 <ozone> shapr: THAC0 is so 90s
01:09:44 <Itkovian> well, add takes three arguments, and there's only three types in the type def.
01:10:20 <Itkovian> b should be of type \beta ... ?
01:11:00 <shapr> Huh, I dunno.
01:11:33 <shapr> Well, look at the type on the next page.
01:11:37 <shapr> It has the same shape.
01:12:10 <shapr> Same further down the second page.
01:12:25 <shapr> addST, addND, addMT
01:17:02 <blackdog> ozone: your geekiness exceeds all bounds.
01:17:28 <ozone> blackdog: your mum exceeds all bounds
01:20:32 <nibro> @seen dons
01:20:33 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell. Last spoke 46 minutes 31 seconds ago.
01:28:55 <shapr> @seen joe
01:28:56 <lambdabot> I haven't seen joe
01:33:15 <nibro> shapr: having fun?
01:34:45 <shapr> As usual. What about you?
01:35:12 <Itkovian> @seen boegel
01:35:13 <lambdabot> I saw boegel leaving #haskell 1 hour 19 minutes 42 seconds ago.
01:35:58 <shapr> A Turing Extender still sounds like something I'd get spam about.

01:36:09 <nlv11757_> "undefined reference to `__stginit_ControlziMonadziReader_" while linking
01:36:14 <nlv11757_> what did i forget?
01:36:24 <shapr> package flag?
01:36:35 <nlv11757_> is that necessary for monads?
01:36:46 <shapr> I don't think so.
01:37:09 <nibro> shapr: well, bug tracking/fixing is never a blast...
01:37:21 <shapr> It can be fun if you write unit tests.
01:37:26 <nibro> nlv11757_: it's in mtl I think
01:37:41 <nibro> but it should be available by default
01:37:51 <nlv11757_> hmmm
01:37:58 <Lemmih> Only if you're using --make.
01:38:11 <musasabi> shapr: Did you look at the new hxt? It has an arrow interface...
01:38:57 <shapr> Developing with good unit test coverage is like the difference between walking and inline skating.
01:39:04 <nibro> Lemmih: aha, thanks for that comment, it's great to learn from other's experience without having to do the errors yourself ;-)
01:39:12 * shapr stabs Zope for its difficulty with unit tests.
01:39:17 <nlv11757_> Lemmih: i am compiling with --make, but not linking with --make
01:39:20 <shapr> musasabi: I've seen the docs, haven't tried it myself yet.
01:39:44 <nibro> nlv11757_: it's the linker that fails, to try to give it the -package mtl flag
01:39:44 <musasabi> but back to studying NLP.
01:40:03 <Lemmih> nlv11757_: Why aren't you linking with --make?
01:40:08 <nlv11757_> i dont know :D
01:40:49 <nlv11757_> Lemmih: i thought it was meaningless for linking, just like -O2
01:41:35 <nlv11757_> ghc -o doesnt work with --make
01:41:50 <Itkovian> any suggestions for reading wav files?
01:42:13 <Lemmih> Itkovian: You wanna play or modify them?
01:42:22 <Itkovian> I don't think Happy will do this well ... as I don't immediately see how I can tell it to read e.g. two bytes and make an Int out of it ...
01:42:29 <Itkovian> all help is welcome
01:42:42 <nlv11757_> -pcakge mtl solved it nibro
01:42:45 <nlv11757_> thanks
01:42:49 <nlv11757_> -package that is
01:42:53 <Itkovian> Lemmih: I wish to read them, and convert the data stream to values in [-1,1]
01:43:04 <nibro> nlv11757_: glad to help :)
01:44:19 <shapr> Itkovian: Did you see the MPEG decoder df_ wrote? Maybe it does bitgrabbing in some easy to borrow manner?
01:44:30 <nibro> btw, mtl = abbr "Monad Transformer Library"
01:44:59 <musasabi> Itkovian: aren't those RIFF ?
01:45:08 <shapr> Monad Transmografier Laboratory!
01:45:28 * shapr transmografies lambdabot into an exact duplicate!
01:45:47 <musasabi> Itkovian: it was quite simple (I wrote some code to parse some things out of RIFF files a while back (and don't remember where that landed))  but it didn't take a long time.
01:46:00 <Itkovian> musasabi: eh? yeah... I guess you could call them that, RIFF is the first word in the header ...
01:46:10 <Itkovian> shapr: url?
01:46:25 <shapr> um, I forget.
01:46:40 <Itkovian> shapr: you forgot to chang transmogifier into duplicator!
01:46:48 <shapr> doh!
01:47:20 <Lemmih> dons: Ping.
01:47:59 <musasabi> Itkovian: the format is really simple. (the same is for avi files)
01:48:58 <Itkovian> musasabi: yes, but how can I tell happy to read _two_ bytes?
01:49:46 <musasabi> Itkovian: I used the binary parser things I use for dns too.
01:50:01 <Itkovian> musasabi: where can I find those?
01:52:02 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/DNS, but that is old - I can publish a more updated version if you are really interested.
01:53:42 <Itkovian> I think mitchkov will be interested (boegel's friend)
01:53:55 <Itkovian> so yeah, an update would be appreciated
01:55:04 <musasabi> Itkovian: can you bug me in the evening/tomorrow and I will do something about it - an exam in two hours and probably should read more petty mathematics of NLP.
01:55:28 <Itkovian> ah. good luck
01:56:10 <shapr> NeuroLinguistic Programming has petty mathematics?
01:56:40 <tuomov> non-linear programming?
01:57:13 <tuomov> natural language processing?
02:01:06 <musasabi> natural language processing.
02:06:56 <shapr> Ah, ok.
02:08:43 * shapr sings cheerfully
02:10:43 <Itkovian> a nice sample of natural language ...
02:13:56 <nibro> w00t!
02:14:19 * nibro just fixed his hspr-cgi bug
02:15:54 <shapr> yay!
02:21:00 <nibro> well, one of them at least :-\
02:24:12 <shapr> groklaw.net is great fun to read.
02:24:46 <shapr> It's like if HardCopy and The Enquirer were suddenly taken over by a group of Linux Kernel Hackers.
02:29:35 <nibro> what headers must be set in the result of a cgi script?
02:29:57 <nibro> I though Content-Length only would do the trick...
02:36:37 <dons> Lemmih: ack.
02:42:31 <Lemmih> dons: How do you install hs-plugins locally?
02:42:54 <dons> do you mean other than in /usr/local ?
02:43:05 <dons> or inplace?
02:43:18 <Lemmih> s/install/register/
02:43:40 <dons> ah. that's hard, if you don't have write access to package.conf
02:43:53 <Lemmih> );
02:44:09 <dons> what can be done is to build it, and then use the in-place package.conf
02:44:20 <nibro> couldn't you install it in your local package.conf with 6.4?
02:44:24 <nibro> i.e. --user
02:44:42 <dons> i.e. ghc MySrc.hs -package-conf /a/b/plugins/plugins.conf.inplace -package plugins
02:44:50 <dons> nibro's suggestion probably works too
02:44:54 <dons> haven' tried that
02:45:02 <dons> read up on ghc-pkg, I think.
02:45:40 <Lemmih> nibro: That would be really easy to do if hs-plugins used the Cabal build system.
02:45:58 <nibro> Lemmih: that was why I phrased it as a question ;)
02:47:06 <nibro> Lemmih: maybe just maybe you could write something like
02:47:26 <nibro> make register GHC_PKG="ghc-pkg --user"
02:47:53 <nibro> don't know if that def of the var will be overridden by config.mk though
02:48:32 <nibro> dons: I have a "bug" fix for you, assuming you'll start using hsx that is ;)
02:49:04 <Lemmih> hs-plugins is parsing '-u' to ghc-pkg /-:
02:49:51 <nibro> dons: the merge functions can't handle files that begin with a "# ...." line
02:50:51 <nibro> Lemmih: hack the Makefile, insert --user in the correct places?
02:51:33 <otje> I'm having troubles making an if-then-else statement in Haskell
02:51:56 <vegai> what sorta?
02:52:00 <Lemmih> @plugs (if True then "True" else "False")
02:52:07 <lambdabot> "True"
02:52:40 <df_> is it me or is lambdabot a bit `slower' now? (either latentcy or just being slow)
02:53:35 * nibro runs off to lunch
02:53:46 <otje> ermm I'm using wxHaskell, and using a fileOpenDialog I get a "maybefile", which is (Just Filename) or (Nothing)
02:54:03 <otje> If it's Just Filename I want to open it, if Nothing I want to give an error message
02:54:08 <otje> sounds simple but can't get it to work
02:54:48 <Lemmih> @plugs let x = Just "Yo" in case x of Just y -> y; Nothing -> "Nothing"
02:54:48 <otje> tried something like ; if (isJust maybefile) then x <- readFile (fromJust maybefile) else errormessage foo
02:54:49 <lambdabot> "Yo"
02:54:57 <Lemmih> @plugs let x = Nothing in case x of Just y -> y; Nothing -> "Nothing"
02:54:59 <lambdabot> "Nothing"
02:55:26 <otje> it's all in a big 'do' block
02:55:29 <Lemmih> otje: 'x <- readFile ...' is not an expression.
02:56:02 <otje> well, x <- readFile (fromJust Filename) works
02:56:09 <otje> but crashes if filename is not correct
02:56:12 <dons> df_, could be a bit slower -- my nightly ghc builds have started
02:56:17 <df_> ah
02:57:34 <Lemmih> otje: Either do 'x <- if isJust file then .. else ...' or 'x <- case file of Just y -> ...; Nothing -> ..'
02:58:24 <otje> ah, you have to place the if-then-else after the <-, okay :]
03:00:06 <otje> works, thx
03:07:38 <otje> hmm not quite: I now have 'x <- if (isJust maybeFile) then readFile (fromJust maybeFile) else readFile "test.txt"' for testing, but what I really want is that it gives me an empty string in case of the 'else'
03:07:43 <otje> but it has to have type IO String
03:08:05 <Lemmih> return ""
03:08:45 * otje goes back to sleep
03:08:45 <otje> thanks
03:28:14 <shapr> df_: yeah, .au latency
03:28:20 <shapr> I think
03:29:33 <df_> oh, yes, crikey -- didn't consider it being down there
03:39:07 <dons> .au latency. hehe
03:39:16 <dons> could be
03:39:58 <dons> actually, it's .eu latency.
03:40:05 <dons> no latency issues here ;)
03:41:28 <dons> df_, what's the ping time to manzano.cse.unsw.edu.au vs shapr's box?
03:42:07 <Function> hi
03:42:22 <df_> rtt = .3s to manzano.cse.unsw.edu.au
03:42:27 <Function> I have some code that generates a parsing error, no clue why though
03:42:33 <Function> pretty new to Haskell so...
03:42:49 <Function> ./Auxiliaries.hs:34: parse error on input `<-'
03:43:00 <Function> eqClass f (x:xs) = (x:[e|e<-xs, f x e]) : eqClass f [e|e<-xs, not (f x e)]
03:43:03 <df_> shapr is on an ipv6 node
03:43:04 <Function> looks valid to me
03:43:08 <dons> df_, what about scannedinavian.org?
03:43:22 <df_> 50ms
03:43:22 <dons> or is that completely unrelated.
03:44:13 <Function> can anyone spot what's wrong?
03:44:14 <dons> so there's a bit of latency to get to the other side of the planet. however, I do notice a  bit of a slow down when the nightly build kick in
03:44:41 <Lemmih> @plugs [e|e<-[1..10],even e]
03:44:47 <lambdabot> [2,4,6,8,10]
03:45:04 <dons> @type let eqClass f (x:xs) = (x : [e | e <- xs, f x e]) : eqClass f [e|e<-xs, not (f x e)] in eqClass
03:45:09 <lambdabot> bzzt
03:46:00 <Function> "bzzt" means error?
03:46:03 <Function> :P
03:46:14 <dons> and you though ghc had obscure error msgs
03:46:18 <dons> thought
03:47:35 <tuomov> works for me..
03:48:17 <psi> and for me (in ghci)
03:49:08 <dons> "not an expression"
03:49:26 <dons> oh, got it.
03:50:50 <Function> well?
03:52:30 <Function> Haskell is frustrating for me, as a C coder
03:52:32 <Function> :\
03:52:55 <dons> seems find. eqClass :: forall a. (a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [[a]]
03:52:56 <tromp> no pain, no gain:)
03:55:55 <Function> I still get " parse error on input `<-'"
03:56:30 <tuomov> would you happen to have some weird spaces somewhere or something?
03:57:09 <tromp> parse error on what?
03:57:14 <tuomov> although, both ghci and hugs seem to treat alt+space as space
03:58:19 <Function> not that I know of
03:58:22 <Function> I'll re-type it
03:59:03 <Function> ow wow, it works
03:59:55 <Function> these files were written in Windows
03:59:58 <Function> and I'm on Linux
04:01:31 <df_> dos2unix
04:02:07 <df_> or perl -p -i -e s/\r$//
04:02:29 <df_> (you'll need to single quote that regexp)
04:02:36 <Function> cheers
04:22:42 <dons> morning TheHunter
04:22:55 <TheHunter> heya dons.
04:25:04 <dons> I got haddocks generated - you might want to just check the clean up tweaks to PlModule/* I had to do to get haddock to work
04:25:29 <dons> haddock doesn't like n+k patterns, or some of the fancier local type annotations
04:25:41 <TheHunter> yes, haddock is strange. Why doesn't it just use ghc's parser?
04:26:28 * Igloo puts on his "Long live n+k patterns" t-shirt
04:26:30 <dons> well, it's an external tool so it uses a library. Same issue with alex and happy (with the code that can be included in stubs)
04:26:36 <blackdog> good evening #haskell
04:26:43 <dons> oh, Igloo.
04:26:48 <dons> hey blackdog
04:27:03 <Igloo> "oh, Igloo"? What sort of a greeting is that?  :-)
04:27:07 <blackdog> Igloo: never quite understood the point. Remind me why they're nice?
04:27:25 <Igloo> blackdog: foo (n+1) = f n + g n + h n
04:27:32 <blackdog> sounds like you just spilled something down your best shirt, and dons is your long-suffering mama...
04:27:37 <Igloo> Also, they make mathematical definitions map more directly to code
04:27:44 <dons> that's true.
04:27:54 <blackdog> does it only apply to '+', or any operator?
04:27:56 <Igloo> e.g. my offside rule code looks more like the spec in the report because of them
04:28:05 <Igloo> Only +
04:28:12 <dons> ah, that's a good point
04:28:15 <blackdog> seems a tad ... specific
04:28:26 <Igloo> I wouldn't object to it being generalised, just taken away
04:28:47 <TheHunter> yes, views are a great idea.
04:29:31 <dons> hehe, says TheHunter, Mr. n+k/implicit params/type hackery
04:29:43 <tuomov> : too..
04:29:57 <Igloo> But it's not really specific, though. It's just like f (x:xs) = foo xs for numbers
04:30:15 <Igloo> Just inwardly translate to Succs and you'll be fine  :-)
04:31:11 <tuomov> I don't know what "views" are exactly, but if they're what I've also been thinking about, they'd be cool
04:31:36 <TheHunter> http://www.haskell.org/development/views.html
04:31:45 <TheHunter> (23 Oct 1996!)
04:33:46 <tuomov> yeah, pretty much seems the same idea
04:35:00 <nlv11757_> somebody always told me n+k was not meant for use
04:37:39 <TheHunter> dons, ok i don't think there's even a chance that scoped type variable code in Transform.hs can be done with ghc-6.2, -fno-monomorphism-restriction and haddock.
04:38:19 <dons> yeah. that's what I though.
04:38:28 <dons> so I just left it out of the haddock doc list
04:38:57 <dons> I'm a fan of scoped type variables, so that's ok.
04:40:10 <TheHunter> well, actually i could monomorphize the whole thing... Set is the only instance of MonadPlusO that's being used anyway.
04:41:12 <dons> there's no huge need to hack away just to make haddock happy. only if you think it's reasonable

05:10:51 <nlv11757_> i now truly know what doaitse meant when saying monads were like a disease
05:10:58 <nlv11757_> i had to modify a LOT of functions
05:11:15 * shapr bounces randomly
05:11:15 <nlv11757_> actually earthy, i monadized most of the UU.Pretty combinators
05:12:05 <Philippa> it would be a lot easier if there were an easy way to write in the Identity monad by default
05:12:40 <Philippa> though that does make it hard to move to something like Arrows where appropriate
05:12:51 <TheHunter> if you don't need Hugs compatibiliy, implicit parameters are perfect for that kind of job.
05:12:58 <Philippa> OTOH, there's a lot of neat tricks you can pull if every function's in a (possibly type-parametised) monad
05:13:16 <TheHunter> as you only have to change type signatures.
05:13:25 <Philippa> and potentially only in one place
05:13:40 <nlv11757_> hmm i felt Reader monad was a better match, although meaning more work
05:13:42 <Philippa> you can let most things just return m a and "fill it in" when you call the monad's run func
05:13:45 <roconnor> @cow
05:13:46 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "yow"
05:13:46 <lambdabot> I'm reporting for duty as a modern person.  I want to do the Latin
05:13:46 <lambdabot> Hustle now!
05:13:48 <nlv11757_> i hope i was right about that later on
05:14:05 <Philippa> IME once you've monadicised your code things get a lot easier
05:14:10 <earthy> you hope you will have been right?
05:14:13 <Philippa> changing the monad in question's not half as problematic
05:14:36 <Philippa> (would be even less so if more people were in the habit of providing a type class as a signiature for the operations their monads support)
05:14:38 <nlv11757_> thats what im hoping for indeed, that life gets easy after this monadization phase
05:15:19 <Philippa> FWIW, monadisation does /not/ inherantly kill laziness - a 'pure&lazy' monad's entirely possible (and even in a strict lang, which is cooler)
05:15:31 <TheHunter> nlv11757_, reader monads and implicit parameters are exactly the same thing, except for compatibility issues and some people considering them evil.
05:15:57 <Philippa> IMO there's rather a lot of justification for considering implicit parameters evil
05:16:01 <nlv11757_> ow, well....i decided to use Reader monads because that implicit parameter thing did look a bit rough on the eyes
05:16:03 <Philippa> they sure as hell don't make typechecking easier
05:16:56 <earthy> implicit parameters interact weirdly with types yes
05:17:06 <earthy> whereas monads don't so much
05:17:21 <roconnor> Hey shapr, is it possible to get the Haskell highlighting code for Moin Moin?
05:17:24 <TheHunter> i think they're built on top of fundeps.
05:18:39 <TheHunter> the only objection I have is that their names aren't first-class objects, but that's less severe a problem than with field labels.
05:22:44 <TheHunter> ime, implicit parameters behave exactly as you expect them to. There's only one exception: recursive functions, but that's an implementation issue.
05:23:00 <Itkovian> I'd love to have real record fields, with names that may be the same for different data types.
05:23:29 <TheHunter> and, they're damn convinient for experimentally changing code.
05:27:28 <TheHunter> and, as in lambdabot's case, they're nice for modularization because if you don't need monadic code, you don't have to mess with monad transformers.
05:32:05 <nlv11757_> does have an oldschool ring to it....monad transformers
05:41:02 <otje> can I make a default option in a "case xs of .."?
05:41:26 <dons> _ -> f
05:43:46 <nlv11757_> be sure to put it last ;)
05:44:10 <otje> :]
06:24:07 <blackdog> so how new is lambdabot's "do what i mean" mode?
06:24:42 <Lemmih> @hepl help
06:24:43 <lambdabot> Perhaps you meant one of: help pl
06:25:09 <dons> how new? 23 hrs.
06:25:29 <Lemmih> @help pl

06:26:52 <Lemmih> @help' help
06:26:53 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "help"
06:26:53 <lambdabot>  @help <command> - ask for help for <command>
06:27:20 <dons> any comments, feedback?
06:28:18 <nibro> @hlp
06:28:19 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "help"
06:28:19 <lambdabot>  @help <command> - ask for help for <command>
06:28:44 <nibro> @list
06:28:45 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "dict"
06:28:45 <lambdabot> Supported dictionary-lookup commands:
06:28:45 <lambdabot>   @all-dicts @devils @easton @elements @foldoc @gazetteer @hitchcock @jargon
06:28:45 <lambdabot>  @lojban @prelude @vera @web1913 @wn @world02
06:28:45 <lambdabot> Use "@dict-help [cmd...]" for more.
06:28:55 <Lemmih> haha
06:29:03 <nibro> that one's not good... ;-)
06:29:08 <dons> it's possible that we could throw in some heuristics
06:29:36 <dons> but the idea was to be a spell checker, not a unique prefix system
06:29:47 <dons> I imagine we could do both though
06:30:17 <nibro> aye, people will probably be more used to prefix system in any case
06:30:21 <dons> list -> dist -> dict , so list/dict isn't surprising
06:30:32 <nibro> not at all =)
06:30:36 <dons> @mroe
06:30:37 <lambdabot> Perhaps you meant one of: moo more
06:30:58 <dons> most common are transposition, and repeated char errors
06:31:05 <dons> so I could tune the algo for those
06:31:16 <nibro> but I agree that a spell checker is really good to have, the way we normally write here ;-)
06:31:18 <dons> and prefix matcher on top of that would be nice too
06:32:16 <nibro> dons: drops should be fairly common as well, e.g. hlp
06:32:22 <dons> yeah.
06:32:51 <dons> @plgs 1
06:32:51 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "plugs"
06:32:56 <df_> ~je;[
06:32:56 <lambdabot> 1
06:32:56 <dons> @pluggs 1
06:32:57 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "plugs"
06:32:57 <lambdabot> 1
06:33:06 <dons> @plgus 1
06:33:06 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "plugs"
06:33:07 <lambdabot> 1
06:33:14 <dons> so that catches what I wanted to catch.
06:33:26 <vegai> that's a bit spammy, but temporary?
06:33:27 <kaol> @yow
06:33:28 <lambdabot> I put aside my copy of "BOWLING WORLD" and think about GUN CONTROL
06:33:28 <lambdabot> legislation..
06:33:37 <Lemmih> @pugs 1
06:33:38 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "plugs"
06:33:38 <lambdabot> 1
06:33:45 <dons> well, you're supposed to type it correctly in the first place.
06:33:54 <dons> this saves you retyping it
06:33:59 <dons> if you make a mistake
06:34:11 <df_> @p 1
06:34:12 <lambdabot> I assume you meant "pl"
06:34:12 <lambdabot> 1
06:34:28 <dons> but looks like people want a unique prefix system...
06:34:38 <vegai> yeah, ok
06:34:41 <df_> dons :: people are lazy
06:35:00 <dons> yep. spell checking good, unique prefixes also good. I'll add it
06:35:08 <dons> for all you lazy programmers
06:36:24 <shapr> roconnor: yes, Haskell highlight for moinmoin works via the enscript plugin.
06:37:23 <roconnor> Is it possible to get the code to run on my own moin moin server?
06:37:28 <shapr> yes, definitely.
06:37:36 <roconnor> where I can find the code?
06:37:45 <nibro> df_: is dons of the type "people are lazy"?
06:38:24 <shapr> You can 1. ask google for enscript moinmoin, 2. check the moinmaster wiki plugin market directly for your version 3. ask me for a version of enscript.py that works with moin 1.2
06:38:37 <Lemmih> shapr: How's the collective wiki coming along?
06:38:51 <Lemmih> @google enscript moinmoin
06:38:53 <lambdabot> http://purl.net/wiki/moin/ProcessorMarket
06:38:55 <shapr> Lemmih: The box is online, more details coming soon.
06:40:45 <shapr> As for the Author's Wiki, it's not ready yet, I haven't figured out the correct permissions.

06:43:16 <dons> night!
06:43:32 <df_> ttfn
06:52:21 <roconnor> so, enscript is a moinmoin plugin that does many languages?
06:56:57 <roconnor> http://chem.skku.ac.kr/~wiki/patches/processor/syntax.py doesn't seem to do haskell, unless I am mistaken.

07:07:55 <earthy> is it that late, ozone? :)
07:08:42 <psi> what does @pointless do?
07:11:26 <chr1s> it simplifies expressions, i think

07:13:34 <psi> aha, cool
07:23:08 <CosmicRay> morning everyone
07:23:18 <chr1s> evening
07:23:21 <CosmicRay> shapr: I have a darcs scenario I'd like to run by you....  join me in #darcs?
07:30:11 <roconnor> shapr, can I get your version of enscript.py?
07:31:13 <b0gg1e> hi.
07:31:33 <b0gg1e> is there anything special about exporting Record type constructors?
07:31:46 <b0gg1e> I get a type constructor not in scope error.
07:32:27 <CosmicRay> enscript.py eh
07:33:05 <nibro> b0gg1e: shouldn't be anything special afaik
07:33:18 <b0gg1e> hrm thanks.
07:35:11 <nibro> b0gg1e: a quick test shows it works as expected, what's the error?
07:35:27 <b0gg1e> where's that lisppaste thingy?
07:35:48 <nibro> @paste
07:35:49 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
07:37:20 * b0gg1e added example code:
07:37:34 <b0gg1e> gives Not in scope: type constructor or class `MkTestR'
07:42:41 <Igloo> This is Haskell 98, right? readPatchPS' :: (Stringalike s, ParserM m, Monad (m s)) => m s (Maybe Patch)
07:43:42 * b0gg1e found my error.  Constructro must have same name as type and export must list the fields.
07:45:25 <Igloo> Ah, nhc doesn't like an example lifted directly from the report either
07:49:21 <nibro> b0gg1e: the constructor doesn't have to have the same name as the type, but no constructors are exported unless you write TypeName(..) in your export list (or list the constructors)
07:49:50 <b0gg1e> ah ok.
07:50:53 <b0gg1e> now i have it all right.
07:50:57 <b0gg1e> thanks.
07:51:13 <b0gg1e> was the missing piece for factoring out something as a module.
07:53:11 * Itkovian thinks it is high time for a game.
07:53:21 <Itkovian> bloody projects ;-)
07:53:58 * nibro leaves for home
07:58:22 * Lemmih ponders why an array of TVars is three times slower than an array of MVars.
07:59:37 <gzl> it's T for "three."
07:59:39 * gzl runs
08:00:53 <CosmicRay> heh
08:01:04 <CosmicRay> gzl: so how's your parsec code coming?
08:01:33 <CosmicRay> gzl: btw, I don't remember seeing you around before yesterday, so welcome to #haskell.  Or, if my memory is poor, I apologize for forgetting you :-)
08:05:37 <Lemmih> Eek. Array of TVars gets five times slower than an array of MVars with -O2 /-:
08:07:04 <Igloo> TVars have to do more work
08:07:31 <Igloo> Writing logs, checking for conflicts etc
08:07:36 <Lemmih> Yeah but I'd hoped the performance drop was smaller.
08:08:59 <gzl> CosmicRay: I've been around for a few months. :)
08:09:33 <gzl> CosmicRay: and it's coming ok. I actually decided to solve that problem in a different way, since I decided to just allow a single newline as a paragraph break. but good to know how to do it, regardless.
08:09:47 * Oejet reimplemented QSem to run in O(1) instead of O(n), but the constant was too big.
08:09:48 <CosmicRay> gzl: I should have known.
08:09:55 <CosmicRay> my memory for names is really poor somehow.
08:09:57 <gzl> it's pretty much done, but I'm sure the code could be cleaned up significantly.
08:10:07 <CosmicRay> gzl: is this your first time working with parsec?
08:10:10 <gzl> yes
08:10:24 <gzl> so i'm sure my code is really verbose
08:10:42 <CosmicRay> heh
08:10:47 <CosmicRay> what do you think of parsec?
08:10:47 <Igloo> Oejet: What is n?
08:10:49 <CosmicRay> I'm a big fan
08:11:24 <Oejet> Igloo: QSem uses a list of MVars, IIRC.
08:11:36 <Igloo> !
08:11:48 <Igloo> Oh, for waiting processes?
08:11:53 <Oejet> Yes.
08:12:10 <Igloo> Ah, OK, I'm not worried about that  :-)
08:14:08 <Oejet> Igloo: You shouldn't be anyway.  That is what I found out.
08:16:42 <CosmicRay> http://www.haskell.org/communities/ doesn't show the latest call for contributions, hmm.
08:40:12 <Itkovian> gotta go. bye
08:50:30 <shapr> @yow !
08:50:32 <lambdabot> Hmmm ... an arrogant bouquet with a subtle suggestion of POLYVINYL
08:50:32 <lambdabot> CHLORIDE ...
08:50:38 <kaol> @cow
08:50:39 <lambdabot> Yow!  I just went below the poverty line!
08:50:51 <Lemmih> So, have you all been taking the GHC query?
08:51:02 <shapr> I took it the first time round.
08:51:13 <shapr> And I'm about to post it on LtU
08:52:30 * CosmicRay turns in three entries for HCAR
08:52:35 <shapr> yay!
08:52:54 <shapr> CosmicRay: Btw, you know the HC&AR bossman is here on #haskell, right?
08:53:06 <CosmicRay> no, what's andres' nick?
08:53:59 <shapr> Herr LÃ¶h is the famous kosmikus!
08:54:20 <CosmicRay> well.
08:54:22 <CosmicRay> sure enough.
08:54:37 * CosmicRay updates his mental FiniteMap IRCNick RealName.
08:54:44 <CosmicRay> and stresses the Finite part.
08:54:50 <shapr> Dude, you need to upgrade to Data.Map
08:54:54 <pesco> Deprecated: Use Data.Map
08:54:54 * shapr deletes a mental note
08:54:55 <CosmicRay> heh
08:55:20 <CosmicRay> how is it better than FiniteMap?
08:55:25 <shapr> You should see my Map of IRCNick to RealName. Sometimes I scare myself!
08:55:32 <shapr> Map is a lot faster for one thing.
08:55:41 <CosmicRay> and why does my ghc not know of it?  is it new in 6.4?
08:55:44 <shapr> It has more significant names for methods.
08:55:47 <shapr> It's new in 6.4
08:55:49 <shapr> Sort of new.
08:55:51 <CosmicRay> ah ha.
08:55:56 <machack666> @type Data.Map
08:55:56 <shapr> I think it's from DData originally.
08:55:58 <CosmicRay> can't upgrade until ghc 6.4 hits sid
08:56:01 <lambdabot> bzzt
08:56:10 <pesco> shapr: I'll be sure to address kosmikus as "HC&AR bossman" from now on.
08:56:29 <shapr> haha
08:56:31 <CosmicRay> hey, Data.Map has a bunch of the utilities that I wrote for FiniteMap in MissingH :-)
08:56:43 <CosmicRay> pesco: is your regexp library in HCAR?
08:57:00 <pesco> CosmicRay: I will probably make mention of it.
08:57:07 <CosmicRay> pesco: good.
08:57:25 <CosmicRay> <-- HC&AR deputy enforcer
08:57:30 <pesco> Hehe.
08:58:03 <ibid> CosmicRay: you've advanced fast in the community :)
08:58:18 <rindolf> Hi! Can anyone help with http://sial.org/pbot/9362
08:58:23 <shapr> y0 shlomi, wazzup?
08:58:24 <CosmicRay> ibid: hehe
08:58:29 <pesco> <-- Daisy Duke
08:58:37 <shapr> <--- Roscoe P. Coltrane
08:58:50 <CosmicRay> ibid: kosmikus is away, I can claim anything I want :-)
08:58:57 <ibid> :)
08:59:04 <CosmicRay> hmm, you know, we ought to have a Debian entry in HC&AR.
08:59:04 * shapr is the one with the cute dog
08:59:10 <shapr> yeah, good point!
08:59:16 <Lemmih> rindolf: Try with -package readline
08:59:22 <CosmicRay> igloo or syntaxninja probably ought to write up that one
08:59:31 <CosmicRay> but I could if nobody else wants to
08:59:49 <rindolf> Lemmih: thanks, that worked.
08:59:57 * ibid is the one who used to do lots of stuff but no longer :)

09:04:19 <rindolf> Lemmih: why isn't it required on some systems?
09:05:12 <Lemmih> rindolf: Why is what?
09:05:47 <rindolf> Lemmih: why isn't -package readline required on some systems in order to compile Haskell programs with readline support?
09:07:15 <mayhem> hi guys
09:07:17 <rindolf> Lemmih: ?
09:07:19 <Lemmih> Maybe because you're use some other library which uses readline or because you're using GHCi or because you're using the --make option.
09:07:21 <rindolf> Hii mayhem
09:07:32 <mayhem> is there a real name for something like 'reverse continuation'
09:07:36 <rindolf> Lemmih: I'm not.
09:07:43 <Lemmih> s/you're use/you're using/
09:08:01 <rindolf> Lemmih: it is required on my system. But other people who use pugs don't require it.
09:09:32 <Lemmih> rindolf: Make a minimal error case and report it then (:
09:22:21 <shapr> Is it too cheesy to refer to the GHC dev team as "The Simons"?
09:22:41 <shapr> mayhem: cocontinuation?
09:24:59 <Lemmih> Last year there were an average of 70 people in #haskell, now there's 143. World domination is pretty close if we keep doubling our numbers every year.
09:25:35 <Oejet> Java has 165.
09:25:47 <shapr> At a miminum we will approach total inability to read the channel discussions.
09:26:15 <CosmicRay> shapr: #debian has 825
09:26:22 <CosmicRay> can still read discussions :-)
09:26:24 <shapr> CosmicRay: and less than three times the traffic of #haskell :-P

09:34:45 <shapr> too bad haskell.org doesn't run fingerd
09:37:09 * Igloo wonders if I'm a student or a researcher
09:38:28 <shapr> Can STM be used to implement the 'kill the leftovers' futures pattern that Andris Birkman asks about on LtU?
09:38:45 * shapr thinks not
09:40:03 <Lemmih> Am I the only one who can't build GHC from cvs because ghc/compiler/utils/Pretty.lhs shadows Pretty from the 'text' package?
09:42:51 * shapr hops cheerfully
09:43:18 <shapr> I have contact lens again! I can unicycle and still see where I'm going! w00!
09:43:22 <Igloo> Lemmih: It worked for me last night, building with 6.4
09:45:41 <shapr> I'm confused about Cabal package entries for "Foo.hs" shadowing another Foo.hs. I think I expected a Package entry to have only reserved something like $PACKAGEROOT/LibName/Foo.hs. Does that make sense?
09:46:17 * shapr needs to reread Cabal docs.
09:47:01 <vegai> are you saying that if there are FooName/Foo.hs and BarName/Foo.hs, it doesn't work?
09:47:11 <shapr> I don't know.
09:47:24 <shapr> I'm not quite sure when -hidepackage is required.
09:48:06 <shapr> And I have just realized I probably shouldn't have opened my mouth (err, pressed the keys, whatever) without checking my assumptions at the door.
09:48:46 <vegai> yep, seems to work
09:49:08 <shapr> It bugs me when people ask questions from a totally uninformed perspective, but it bugs me far more when it's me doing the asking.
09:50:09 <sond> heh :)
09:50:11 <Lemmih> Hidden packages aren't hidden for some reason /-:
10:02:10 <shapr> rindolf: so, learning Haskell for pugs hacking reasons?

10:25:54 <gzl> wait, another one?
10:25:57 <gzl> or the original one?
10:26:01 <mayhem> the first noe
10:26:24 <gzl> ok.
10:28:36 <mayhem> the abstract of this paper is awesome
10:35:43 <shapr> bok gour
10:37:29 <CosmicRay> did you guys see that fake CS paper generator thingy?
10:38:04 <mayhem> CosmicRay, thats what we're talking about
10:38:12 <CosmicRay> ah
10:39:21 <CosmicRay> heh, this isn't the same one they submitted, is it?
10:39:49 <CosmicRay> but this is great too
10:39:55 <CosmicRay> godel, church, curry, turing, and kleene :-)
10:40:39 <gzl> haha yeah
10:40:47 <sorje> " Our solution is related to research into the simulation of massive multiplayer online role-playing games," Gahaha
10:41:10 <gzl> there's something disturbing about church playing a MMORPG
10:41:44 * shapr boings cheerfully
10:41:54 <CosmicRay> heh
10:42:08 <shapr> Hey did you guys see the gorgeous CFDG linked near to the SCIgen thingy?

10:46:38 <wagle> shapr: yeah, the paper generators is what lead me there..  the papert generator is the current buzz on the mailing list for cognitive science at indiana university
10:47:26 <mayhem> I love it
10:47:42 <mayhem> random papers should be sent to many other conferences
10:47:54 <shapr> I've been trying to come up with something interesting for CFDG. No luck so far.
10:48:02 <shapr> I don't really understand all the rules yet.
10:48:19 <shapr> It looks like something that desperately needs a DSL though.

12:05:28 <liquidengineer> hi gusyy
12:05:31 <liquidengineer> how's it goin?
12:05:45 <liquidengineer> ...pardon the typos
12:06:08 <shapr> just chillin in the hood man
12:06:22 <liquidengineer> I have a question, not so much about haskell as binary tree algorithms
12:06:23 <shapr> smokin a redex, liftin some lambdas
12:07:02 <liquidengineer> I'm actually coding it in Java (bleh) but they're having some sort of holy war in there over  whether or not static functions should ever be used so the whole room's pretty much useless
12:07:16 <shapr> oboy
12:07:24 <liquidengineer> \anyhow
12:07:29 <liquidengineer> I'm doing a binary taxonomy tree
12:07:57 <liquidengineer> instead of allowing us to use serialized objects like sane programmers, our instructor wants us to do reads and writes to a textfile, all recursively
12:08:35 <liquidengineer> writing to the file was actually pretty easy using preorder traversal
12:08:46 <liquidengineer> getting the tree out is proving difficult
12:09:54 <shapr> Can you do the hard part on the write side instead of the read side?
12:10:20 <Oejet> What a crazy map projection: http://www.student.dtu.dk/~s022018/Zip/testrtigrniggfd.png
12:10:42 <liquidengineer> shapr: what do you mean?
12:11:56 <shapr> At first thought, it sounds like you're writing to the file the easy way, but you have to really think to read back from the file.
12:12:11 <liquidengineer> yeah
12:12:25 <shapr> So, why not reorder the data you write to the file in such a way that you can directly read it back out, with only very simple code in the "read from" part?
12:13:13 <shapr> Make sense?
12:13:50 <liquidengineer> yeah
12:13:54 <liquidengineer> that's what I want to do
12:14:09 <liquidengineer> I'm just not exactly sure what that "really simple file format" is
12:14:30 <shapr> What does one of your files look like right now?
12:14:51 <shapr> have it online?
12:14:55 <liquidengineer> I can.
12:14:59 <liquidengineer> hold on
12:15:08 <liquidengineer> heck
12:15:14 <liquidengineer> can i just stick it in the wiki?
12:15:17 <liquidengineer> it's like seven lines
12:15:27 <shapr> wfm
12:15:29 <shapr> (works for me)
12:17:32 <liquidengineer> urg
12:17:37 <shapr> ?
12:17:37 <liquidengineer> it cut out my newlines
12:17:55 <shapr> use {{{ \n  stuff \n }}}
12:18:00 <shapr> with those \n being real newlines
12:18:51 <liquidengineer> there we go
12:18:56 <liquidengineer> fixed
12:19:19 <liquidengineer> the tree was loaded in preorder
12:19:23 <liquidengineer> so it's reading the root
12:19:33 <liquidengineer> then the all the nodes as far left as it can go
12:19:54 <liquidengineer> then the right nodes
12:21:19 <shapr> Well, you need to figure a way to delimit nodes and branches, right?
12:22:08 <liquidengineer> Nodes have capital letters
12:22:14 <liquidengineer> leaves have lowercase starting letters
12:23:08 <shapr> So how do you know if something in the file is the end of a branch?
12:26:02 * shapr pokes liquidengineer
12:26:19 <liquidengineer> .....
12:26:24 <liquidengineer> I didn't think about that
12:26:24 <shapr> thinking?
12:26:35 <liquidengineer> I just worried about recursing till we hit a null pointer
12:26:41 <skew> what's wrong with preorder? That is self-delimiting if you can tell nodes from leaves
12:26:54 <shapr> is it?
12:26:57 <skew> yeah
12:27:02 <skew> just like postorder
12:27:08 <skew> forth doesn't need parnes
12:27:11 * shapr waits for enlightenment from skew
12:27:15 <shapr> How to read it back then?
12:27:24 <liquidengineer> yes
12:27:26 <liquidengineer> do tell
12:27:29 <liquidengineer> (please.)
12:27:51 <skew> What expression is + * 2 3 - 1 - 2 3?
12:28:06 <shapr> Do you need to leave empty lines for blank leaves?
12:28:29 <skew> I'm assuming you can recognize nodes and leaves somehow. Maybe his example does something wierd
12:28:38 <liquidengineer> skew
12:28:41 <liquidengineer> err...
12:28:47 <liquidengineer> skew: it's on the paste page, the file
12:28:50 <skew> what do you mean, "blank leaf"?
12:28:52 <liquidengineer> Nodes start with capital letters
12:29:00 <liquidengineer> leaves start with lowercase letters
12:29:08 <liquidengineer> (I figured I can fix formatting when I print)
12:29:49 <skew> a leaf that contains no useful data? But why print that as the empty string if "<emptyleaf>" or some other marker is more convenient to read and to parse?
12:30:22 <liquidengineer> there ARE no empty leaves
12:30:27 <skew> is the format of the file fixed?
12:30:27 <liquidengineer> it's a complete tree
12:30:31 <skew> Oh, I see.
12:30:35 <liquidengineer> so at worst some nodes just have one chiild
12:30:38 <skew> Items are whole lines, not just words
12:30:47 <liquidengineer> skew: yes
12:30:50 <liquidengineer> it's a tree of strings
12:30:57 <liquidengineer> and I can do whatever I want in terms of file format
12:30:58 <skew> liquidengineer, shapr means a leaf whose text is the empty string
12:31:08 <liquidengineer> skew: that will never happen
12:31:19 <skew> ever hear of a "recursive descent parser"?
12:31:36 <liquidengineer> leaves will either be yes/no questions or an answer (leaf)
12:32:08 <liquidengineer> *nodes will either be...
12:32:40 <skew> readtree = do thisLine <- getLine; if isUpper (head thisLine) then do l <- readTree ; r <- readTree ; return (Node thisLine l r) else return (Leaf thisLine)
12:33:16 <liquidengineer> yikes
12:33:20 <liquidengineer> what does that do?
12:33:21 <skew> shapr: Do you understand what I'm talking about
12:33:30 <skew> liquidengineer: that's the entire parser, I think
12:33:41 <skew> If you don't mind Haskell.
12:33:46 <liquidengineer> skew: I'm writing this in Java though
12:33:56 <liquidengineer> I just wanted advice on the algorithm
12:34:08 <skew> this is the sort of thing where I would probably write up the Haskell solution and turn it in too, just to show my scorn for their language of choice
12:34:16 <liquidengineer> ......
12:34:24 <liquidengineer> my teacher would NOT be amused
12:34:33 <liquidengineer> and I don't like listening to her gripe me out
12:34:50 <skew> ... turn it in *too* ...
12:35:21 <liquidengineer> she'd still gripe me out
12:35:36 <liquidengineer> anyhow, could you explain to me what exactly that sniippet does?
12:36:04 <skew> a little note like "I'm learning this nifty language called Haskell, and I noticed it makes this problem really easy, so I included an alternate solution under haskell/"
12:36:25 <liquidengineer> ........
12:36:31 <skew> If your teacher would object to you doing extra work because you are really into the material, then something is wrong
12:36:32 <liquidengineer> okay
12:36:46 <liquidengineer> I'm also taking a seperate FP class, so it'd make sense
12:36:58 <skew> So, you start reading a line
12:37:02 <liquidengineer> but still, at this point I just want to understand the algorithm
12:37:13 <skew> I mean, you start reading the serialization of a tree
12:37:14 <liquidengineer> okay
12:37:21 <liquidengineer> I can't serialize the tree
12:37:27 <liquidengineer> it's a pure text file
12:37:28 <skew> you know the tree either starts with a node, or a leaf
12:37:37 <skew> liquidengineer: sounds pretty serial to me
12:37:42 <liquidengineer> oh
12:37:52 <liquidengineer> I thought you were talking about representing the object as binary and stuffing it in a file
12:38:21 <skew> and you can tell those cases apart by grabbing the first line of the file and testing if it starts with an uppercase letter
12:38:34 <liquidengineer> exactly
12:39:08 <skew> If it's lowercase, then this line is the complete printed representation (if that's less confusing) of the leaf, and you are done parsing this tree
12:39:35 <skew> otherwise, you know that the rest of the file consists of the printed representation of the left subtree followed by the printed representation of the right subtree
12:40:11 <liquidengineer> right
12:40:13 <skew> so you call your parse function twice, once to grab the left subtree and once to grab the right subtree.
12:40:23 <skew> Now you have all the parts of a tree, and put them together
12:40:55 <liquidengineer> I wish there were a way I could show you my code
12:41:06 <liquidengineer> I feel like I'm really close to that
12:41:13 <liquidengineer> I'm just doing something stupid
12:41:16 <skew> where do you get the trees from?
12:41:20 <liquidengineer> files
12:41:28 <skew> in what kind of format?
12:41:29 <liquidengineer> like the file I put on the paste bin
12:41:32 <liquidengineer> .txt
12:41:37 <skew> what are you supposed to do with them?
12:41:43 <liquidengineer> I read them in
12:41:47 <liquidengineer> play the animal game
12:41:52 <skew> okay
12:41:58 <liquidengineer> the animal game modifies the tree
12:42:02 <liquidengineer> I write it out to the file I got it from
12:42:03 <skew> huh?
12:42:10 <liquidengineer> I've got the reading playing and modifying part down
12:42:13 <skew> How is the animal game supposed to go?
12:42:22 <liquidengineer> it's a binary taxonomy tree
12:42:43 <skew> yeah. I see how to run down the tree asking the questions, and then make a guess at the end. I don't see how this modifies the tree.
12:42:45 <liquidengineer> example, if the answer to the question "Are you a mammal" is yes, you go left, otherwise go right
12:43:32 <liquidengineer> skew: there's some code that allows you to tell the computer it's made a wrong guess (i.e.: the leaf we hit is not the answer) and modify the tree in memory with a new question that will make the tree "smarter"
12:43:35 <Arsilan> HalÃ¸jsa folkens
12:45:23 <Arsilan> HVa sÃ¥, bil gate kommer og besÃ¸ger mig
12:45:35 <Arsilan> for at fortÃ¦lle om sin nyeste windows
12:46:01 <Arsilan> HVis i vil joine mÃ¸det sÃ¥ bare sig til
12:47:01 <liquidengineer> skew: the problem I'm having is this
12:47:16 <liquidengineer> I read in a string from the file, right?
12:47:49 <liquidengineer> I even create a new node called root containing this data with null pointers to childL and childR
12:48:18 <liquidengineer> then I look for an uppercase starting letter on this string
12:48:22 <Arsilan> Bil gate will come and wisit me, to tell me about hisen newest window
12:48:30 <Arsilan> program
12:48:49 <Arsilan> iff you want to jiun me then contact me
12:49:17 <liquidengineer> things are fine and good
12:49:28 <Arsilan> It is in frederiksberg gymnasium
12:49:29 <liquidengineer> if I find an uppercase, I want to do something like this
12:49:58 <liquidengineer> BTNode leftSubtree  = constructTree(root.getLeft(), tFile);
12:49:59 <liquidengineer>            BTNode rightSubtree = constructTree(root.getRight(), tFile);
12:49:59 <liquidengineer>            root.setLeft(leftSubtree);
12:50:00 <liquidengineer>            root.setRight(rightSubtree);
12:50:17 <liquidengineer> except the problem is my root has no children, so the recursive calls fail
12:50:59 * sorje definitely prefers the haskell version ;-)
12:51:11 <skew> whoa, why are you passing the node into this function?
12:51:16 <liquidengineer> It doesn't have any children since I can only read one node/leaf from the file at a time
12:51:26 <liquidengineer> how else can I recurse?
12:51:49 <skew> well, the recursive call could take care of making the node and just return it
12:51:57 <skew> which is the sane way
12:52:29 <liquidengineer> it DOES return a node
12:52:49 <skew> what is it supposed to do with the node it gets?
12:53:00 <skew> I cannot understand why you designed your code this way
12:53:33 <liquidengineer> hold on a second
12:54:26 <Arsilan> Well just i have a better one
12:54:45 <sorje> given data Env = Env{ a,b,c,d,e.. } Can I have a function Env -> Env changing a and passing the rest to the new env?
12:54:52 <Arsilan> (treblacces"
12:54:57 <Arsilan> Of course
12:55:48 <skew> liquidengineer: do you just have this constructTree function, or are you using a different function at the root?
12:55:58 <liquidengineer> just construct tree
12:56:04 <liquidengineer> I put it on the paste bin
12:56:17 <liquidengineer> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview
12:56:23 <skew> so at the firs
12:56:45 <skew> What the heck is that while loop for?
12:57:12 <liquidengineer> the EOF?
12:57:44 <liquidengineer> it tells it to keep going, reading in lines, until the end of file is reached
12:58:03 <skew> you mean, it tell it to keep going, reading in *trees* until the end of file is reached
12:58:23 <liquidengineer> no
12:58:31 <liquidengineer> the file doesn't know it's a tree
12:58:36 <liquidengineer> it just knows about strings
12:58:46 <skew> yes, but the code inside the while does know about trees
12:58:53 <liquidengineer> yes
12:58:54 <skew> Actually, the while just breaks your program
12:58:59 <araujo> any HaskellXMLTool 5.0 user here?
12:59:14 <skew> well, it's broken in several ways
12:59:15 <liquidengineer> skew: exactly.  It tells it when to stop reading the file.
12:59:21 <skew> No!
12:59:55 <skew> if you just recursed you would stop when it was done recursively reading a tree, whether or not there was junk left after that
13:00:12 <skew> if it was just a while loop reading a line it would keep reading a line
13:01:12 <skew> say you have input A B c d e (to be parsed as Node A (Node B (Leaf c) (Leaf d)) (Leaf e)
13:02:28 <skew> constructTree starts going, gets one line, funds it starts with upper case.
13:02:28 <Arsilan> j
13:02:30 <Arsilan> j
13:02:42 <Arsilan> you are right
13:03:51 <skew> so, it makes a recursive call "BTNode leftSubtree = ....". Now we're in connectTree<1> (<1> for first recursion level)
13:04:04 <skew> that reads a line, gets B, realizes it starts with upper case and recurses
13:05:11 <skew> Now we're in connectTree<3>, which reads a line, gets 'c', and decides its a leaf. Now, we've reached the end of the while loop in connectTree<3>, but we are not at EOF, so it loops back to the top of connectTree<3>
13:05:44 <skew> this reads another line, getting d, and overwrites root, losing the value c.
13:06:38 <skew> d starts with lowercase so it decides to make d a leaf node, which doesn't take any recursive calls.
13:07:03 <skew> connectTree<3> reaches the end of it's while loop once more, and goes back around again, grabbing e, and finally returning that
13:07:19 <skew> now the part of the tree we've constructed so far looks like A(B(e,?),?)
13:07:52 <skew> and we're at EOF so all the recursive calls from there on out will just return their "root" argument unchanged, because the !isEOF in the while stops them
13:08:02 <skew> liquidengineer: see what the problem is there?
13:09:02 <liquidengineer> it doesn't work
13:09:11 <skew> did you follow what I said at all?
13:09:17 <liquidengineer> barely
13:09:25 <skew> hmm
13:09:32 <liquidengineer> this tree logic is not something I visualize easy
13:09:41 <liquidengineer> but i understand your point
13:09:47 <skew> just visualize a tree thing
13:09:57 <skew> like the little things they hang over babies
13:10:14 <liquidengineer> okay
13:10:51 <skew> with a big wide plastic rod, with two smaller ones dangling off of the ends of that, with smaller ones off of that, and then little spaceships or something
13:11:11 <liquidengineer> I realize, for example, that these lines
13:11:14 <liquidengineer> TNode leftSubtree  = constructTree(root.getLeft(), tFile);
13:11:14 <liquidengineer>            BTNode rightSubtree = constructTree(root.getRight(), tFile);
13:11:15 <liquidengineer>           
13:11:29 <liquidengineer> die because root has no valid left or right children
13:11:38 <liquidengineer> because all i've done is define a value at root
13:11:52 <skew> btw, once the logic is straightened out you should take the code back to #java, ask for style advice, and listen to what they say after they stop flaming the code
13:12:05 <liquidengineer> skew: I tried taking it to java
13:12:22 <skew> Actually, I don't know how the people in #java are, but this really isn't the appropriate place to talk about Java style
13:12:28 <skew> not that I really want to either
13:12:36 <liquidengineer> they've been arguing about whether or not static functions should be allowed in code AT ALL
13:12:46 <liquidengineer> so it's been pretty useless for the last hour
13:13:05 <skew> It's enough to say that the way you are using this "root" argument is pretty ridiculous if you stop to think about it for a second
13:13:22 <skew> Here, how about I write a tree reader that actually works
13:14:02 <liquidengineer> I don't know how else to do itokay
13:14:11 <liquidengineer> *okay
13:15:06 <mwc> why are we discussing java here? If I wanted to see Java, I'd just drill through my eyes with a powerdrill
13:15:13 * shapr grins
13:15:34 <shapr> liquidengineer: sometimes it's just a lot simpler to write the solution with Haskell and then translate into whatever other language you have.
13:15:51 * mwc nods
13:16:10 <shapr> I also would rather not see Java source, I got paid to write various flavors of Java for a few years.
13:16:20 <mwc> Or, you know, just compile it to C and then hand that in for your assignment
13:16:22 <araujo> any HaskellXMLTool 5.0 user here?
13:16:24 <skew> mwc: I'm discussing how to work with trees (being an algebraic data structure), with a side helping of "Haskell is much better than Java"
13:16:40 <araujo> hah
13:16:49 <araujo> it isn't really difficult to be better than java 8)
13:16:50 <shapr> araujo: I've used HXT, but 5.0 has been out about 24 hours now, I doubt you'll find anyone who's used that version.
13:17:07 <liquidengineer> I get the haskell is much better than java
13:17:28 <liquidengineer> except I'm just learning how to represent ADTs, so I couldn't represent this thing if I tried
13:17:30 <liquidengineer> I don't know how yet
13:17:44 <araujo> shapr, ok.. apparently libHSnetextra.a has been removed.. i just wanted to be sure
13:17:46 <skew> liquidengineer's poor choice of implementation language really has nothing to do with the mathematical essence of recursive tree-building functions
13:17:56 <skew> I wrote my parser
13:18:05 <shapr> liquidengineer: You might even believe what we're saying if you get a chance to read this book: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/Algorithms-functional.html
13:18:19 <liquidengineer> I believe what you're saying
13:18:28 <liquidengineer> hell, I'm in a FP class and I love it
13:18:30 <shapr> Well, it's not his choice, class choice.
13:18:48 <liquidengineer> shapr: thank you
13:18:57 <liquidengineer> I don't inflect harm on myself by choice
13:18:59 <shapr> hehe
13:19:15 <shapr> Much like the years I spent writing Java, I didn't see a better choice. I would get very hungry otherwise.
13:19:24 <liquidengineer> skew: okay
13:19:32 <liquidengineer> would you mind showing me what it looks like?
13:19:33 <shapr> skew: I want to see your code!
13:19:36 <liquidengineer> I'd really appriciate it
13:19:39 <shapr> Will it read the tree he put on the Wiki?
13:19:41 <skew> it's on the paste page
13:19:42 <liquidengineer> me too.  :P
13:19:46 <shapr> oh boy!
13:19:48 <liquidengineer> yes
13:19:59 <skew> It's just the code I typed in here a bit back
13:20:13 <skew> now I should check if it actually works :)
13:20:49 * mwc craves bloody action
13:21:01 * shapr pulls off a Fatality! on lambdabot
13:21:21 <shapr> b-b-f-f-d-u
13:21:23 <shapr> hp
13:21:37 <shapr> That was Reptile's Fatality of course. Am I sad arcade geek or what?
13:21:38 <mwc> FINISH HIM!
13:21:52 * skew fights shapr
13:21:54 <skew> f f hp
13:22:03 <shapr> That's Johnny Cage
13:22:12 <shapr> The software had a bug, you could punch off up to four heads.
13:22:13 <liquidengineer> okay
13:22:19 <skew> (you're supposed to block or something)
13:22:25 <shapr> oh I get it =)
13:22:27 <liquidengineer> short code
13:22:28 <shapr> block
13:22:32 <liquidengineer> how does it work?
13:22:39 <skew> magic!
13:22:41 <shapr> crouch b-low kick
13:22:58 <mwc> What a fascinating modern world we live in
13:23:05 <liquidengineer> damn haskell and it's "watch me do everything in five lines cause I'm just that cool"-ness
13:23:09 <skew> just a minute, I'm trying to make the code work
13:23:11 <shapr> Playing mk2 via irc. That's ... interesting.
13:23:15 * shapr laughs
13:23:19 <skew> actually, it's exactly the code you are writing in Java
13:23:27 <liquidengineer> I realize that
13:23:27 <mwc> liquidengineer, it's cool becuase it's 5 l ines that mean something
13:23:27 <shapr> Java just distracts you badly.
13:23:34 <mwc> not 25 lines of bookkeeping
13:23:35 <liquidengineer> and that's why I'm jealous
13:23:36 <mwc> compute Y and store in X
13:23:37 <skew> just writing in Haskell, and doing the right thing with respect to all those null pointers
13:23:51 <liquidengineer> I'd prefer not to get into an argument over languages
13:23:52 <shapr> Java is all like "look at the waving hand while I rabbit punch you in the ribs."
13:23:55 <liquidengineer> you know I prefer haskell
13:24:01 <mwc> shapr, hah
13:24:01 <skew> I'm trying to get the complete program running
13:24:07 <shapr> Sorry, I'll shaddup about Java.
13:24:20 <liquidengineer> sha: I don't mean to gripe
13:24:26 <liquidengineer> I'm just frustrated
13:24:39 * mwc only had to do Java in highschool programming class, will also shut up
13:24:44 <shapr> Believe it or not, I used to love Java. I used lots of the alpha, the beta, and jdk 1.0.2.
13:24:51 <shapr> highschool? How old are you??
13:25:10 <mwc> shapr, 20
13:25:10 <liquidengineer> how old am I?
13:25:10 <skew> oops, I had switched "node" and "leaf" in one place. No wonder I got type errors!
13:25:11 * shapr suddenly needs a cane to hobble with
13:25:24 <shapr> mwc: bah, I'm 100001
13:25:29 <mwc> They replaced the "Introductory" class with Java instead of OO-Turing
13:25:36 <shapr> OO-Turing?
13:25:40 <skew> hey, I'm 20 too.
13:25:47 <mwc> Yeah, trust me, it's a total piece of shit
13:25:49 <shapr> I'm way past antique.
13:25:52 <skew> shapr: probably related to the Turing of TXL
13:25:56 <shapr> I was wondering that.
13:26:02 <liquidengineer> 21 here
13:26:07 <liquidengineer> okay
13:26:18 <shapr> I'm 21 .... in hex.
13:26:28 * KrispyKringle uses google to convert
13:26:39 <liquidengineer> do line <- getLine
13:26:39 <liquidengineer>      if isUpper (head line)
13:26:50 <skew> and "runTree >>= readTree"!
13:26:51 <shapr> KrispyKringle: c'mon, 10 is how much in hexadecimal?
13:26:57 <KrispyKringle> shapr: i was kidding :P
13:26:58 <skew> man, I'm making all the stupid mistakes today
13:26:58 <liquidengineer> my code does that with a big ugly while containing an if
13:27:00 * shapr grins
13:27:04 <shapr> times two plus one
13:27:04 <KrispyKringle> shapr: you're 57? Wow. You're old!
13:27:09 <shapr> oy!
13:27:10 * KrispyKringle jokes
13:27:14 <mwc> Turing is about as hacked together as VB but more irritating because it's never been used professionally
13:27:19 <mwc> http://www.holtsoft.com/turing/
13:27:28 <shapr> I used VB professionally.
13:27:28 <mwc> it's meant for teaching
13:27:36 <skew> liquidengineer: no, your code does it with an if
13:27:37 <mwc> and like all languages meant just to teach, it's horrible
13:27:39 <KrispyKringle> What is Turing?
13:27:58 <skew> the while around it just makes it run amok and shred the entire file when it gets down to the point where it should read a single leaf
13:29:00 <liquidengineer> should it be an if, then?
13:29:05 <liquidengineer> oh god
13:29:06 <shapr> liquidengineer: I totally understand getting frustrated. I admire your tenacity.
13:29:16 <liquidengineer> that is so not meant to be a pun
13:29:22 <liquidengineer> shapr: thanks
13:29:28 <skew> liquidengineer: huh?
13:29:37 <liquidengineer> instead of a while
13:29:45 <liquidengineer> should I be using an if
13:30:02 <shapr> When I get frustrated I have to drop something for awhile, and come back later.
13:30:03 <liquidengineer> like, if we haven't hit the end of the file yet, read another line
13:30:07 <skew> liquidengineer: no, you should just delete the while. The if inside is all you need
13:30:19 <shapr> That's usually why I have a bunch of different projects at the same time, so I can run in a loop.
13:30:37 <skew> god, I wrote map (toLower answer) too!
13:30:55 <skew> I should just write something to invert the sense of all my code and be done with it
13:30:57 <mwc> :O
13:31:12 <shapr> Hmm, someone wrote in my orkut scrapbook.
13:31:26 <mwc> I want a Haskell-like CAs
13:31:35 <shapr> Isn't there one?
13:31:38 <mwc> that would be the most gorgeous system ever
13:31:53 <mwc> I don't know, in Maple and Mathematica you still do stupid assignment details
13:32:13 <liquidengineer> oh my god
13:32:16 <liquidengineer> DAMN
13:32:21 <liquidengineer> I keep doing this
13:32:42 <liquidengineer> I'm so use to procedural/iterative looping that I keep trying to use whiles when I do recursion
13:32:55 <liquidengineer> whiles loop forever in recursion cause you can't ever break the condition
13:32:57 <liquidengineer> ifs don't
13:33:00 <liquidengineer> DUH
13:33:05 <shapr> mwc: http://www.haskell.org/docon/ ?
13:33:10 <mwc> I find haskell faster to write algos in, but with Maple and Mathematica you have a huge toolbox so if you're working on Numerical Analysis it's pretty quick for that too
13:33:22 <tuomov> maple is awful.. matrices are an awful kludges.. mathematica seems horrible
13:33:54 <mwc> Matrices are kludges?
13:34:03 <astrolabe> but is there anything better?
13:34:04 <tuomov> yeah, they're really difficult to use
13:34:09 <tuomov> no :(
13:34:10 * mwc wipes chewed oreos off screen
13:34:30 <pesco> Fire Your Guns!
13:34:32 <tuomov> what I'd also want is a matlab replacement with type inference and dependently-typed matrices
13:34:33 * shapr fires
13:34:36 * pesco bangs his head.
13:34:39 <mwc> tuomov, tensors are absolutely wonderful
13:34:55 <pesco> matlab *shudder*
13:34:55 <astrolabe> Oh Matlab is much more horrible than mathematica
13:34:58 <mwc> tuomov, try writing out the Einstien field equations in scalar form some time
13:35:15 <mwc> Matlab is basically targeted for numerical work
13:35:24 <monochrom> dependent typing is the key.
13:35:24 <mwc> Mathematica and Maple can do higher level stuff
13:35:26 <liquidengineer> now I'm getting some kind of index error on my strings
13:35:34 <tuomov> the matlab language is an awful kludge, but maple is quite unusable even, and mathematica seems absolutely horrible, although I haven't used it
13:35:42 <skew> I have y,yes,ja,oui. What other affirmative responses should I handle?
13:35:47 <shapr> da
13:35:50 <mwc> Maple is very usable
13:35:51 <astrolabe> I think mathematica is ok
13:35:59 <monochrom> skew: "whatever" :)
13:36:01 <skew> shapr: bal/da?
13:36:01 <shapr> kylla
13:36:03 <pesco> skew: Yes.
13:36:04 <tuomov> skew: kyllÃ¤,joo?
13:36:08 <mwc> f = proc(x) do stuff end proc;
13:36:10 <shapr> oh, I forgot the dots
13:36:16 <tuomov> si?
13:36:17 <pesco> skew: Of course you fuckin' prick.
13:36:19 <mwc> that should be pretty easy to grok for anyone here
13:36:35 <shapr> pesco: that's the frustrated yes?
13:36:46 <tuomov> I don't like the worksheet approach
13:36:54 <mwc> Eh?
13:37:06 <mwc> That's an excellent approach
13:37:12 <tuomov> and it doesn't even always work how one would expect it to
13:37:13 <mwc> that's one of the huge strengths of those systems
13:37:24 <tuomov> sometimes variable bindings are not changed when you change the sheet and so on
13:37:25 <pesco> shapr: Yes. We had a little "thread" here last week about affirmatives when I answered "Yes." to darcs after reviewing 57 changes to revert and it took it as meaning "no".
13:37:35 <shapr> haha
13:37:39 <mwc> tuomov, variables are local to the kernel
13:37:39 <shapr> that's painful
13:37:49 <mwc> it depends if you use the same kernel across worksheets
13:37:49 <tuomov> that sucks
13:37:54 <pesco> Yup.
13:37:57 <tuomov> if you have a worksheet, stuff should be local to the worksheet
13:38:01 <liquidengineer> skew: could you look at the paste page?
13:38:02 <shapr> skew: what's bal?
13:38:04 <liquidengineer> I updated my code
13:38:06 <tuomov> anything else is absolutely brain-damaged
13:38:08 <liquidengineer> I think it's closer to yours now
13:38:15 <Lemmih> @seen SyntaxNinja
13:38:15 <lambdabot> I haven't seen SyntaxNinja
13:38:17 <mwc> tuomov, just set the preferences not to share kernels
13:38:19 <skew> what is "da" from?
13:38:27 <mwc> the worksheet is presentation, the kernel is computation
13:38:30 <skew> da is negative in gostak, by the way
13:38:34 <shapr> oh, wow
13:38:36 <liquidengineer> it recurses for a whiile then bombs out saying I'm trying to do an illegal index access on a string
13:38:39 <shapr> salut Dominic!
13:38:40 <mwc> I don't want those too tightly bound together
13:38:46 <liquidengineer> that's why I had the while loop
13:38:49 <tuomov> and in any case, matrices are absolutely unusable in maple
13:38:59 <liquidengineer> that prevented me from trying to read past the end of file
13:38:59 <mwc> tuomov, no they aren't
13:39:07 <mwc> tuomov, I think you're trollign
13:39:07 * poetix thinks the GHC survey is just a ruse for the GHC developers to show off all the features many users didn't know it had
13:39:12 <shapr> Man, I love this track "Mother Russia" by Orchard
13:39:15 <tuomov> I'm not
13:39:25 <shapr> Maybe you guys just have different opinions?
13:39:27 <tuomov> I've used maple back when I still did some maths at school
13:39:28 <liquidengineer> any ideas?
13:39:31 <tuomov> and it sucks
13:39:37 <mwc> tuomov, what version?
13:39:41 <mwc> >= 9?
13:39:50 <mwc> Or was it Maple V?
13:39:56 <tuomov> I have maple 9.01
13:40:02 <mwc> Ah, that's modern
13:40:05 <tuomov> but I haven't used it much
13:40:13 <tuomov> maple V sounds more familiar
13:40:14 <mwc> well, 9.5 is modern, but 9 is pretty similar
13:40:33 <liquidengineer> maybe if I wrap the entire thing in an if to make sure it doesn't try to run if the string it read from the file is empty
13:40:50 <mwc> 9.5 is a fine program, the only gripe i have is that the GUI is Java and takes forever to load/JIT compile to a usable state
13:41:22 <mwc> tuomov, are you using the Matrix class or what?
13:41:25 <shapr> Have you guys tried DoCon? "DoCon is a Computer Algebra  program written in a purely functional, non-strict language Haskell."
13:41:36 <mwc> I'm gonna give it a shot
13:41:41 <mwc> looks neat
13:41:50 <tuomov> linalg[matrix] or some shit like that
13:41:53 <shapr> "It joins the categorial approach to the mathematical computation expressed via the Haskell type classes, and explicit processing of the domain description terms." whatever that means.
13:41:58 <mwc> right after I finish compiling all of gnome because I tried to pull in gtk-sharp
13:42:03 <mwc> bloody GNome
13:42:32 <kaol> shapr: that sounds like the random scientific paper
13:42:58 <astrolabe> Interesting shapr
13:43:09 <shapr> Well, this is real software, even though I still don't know what that all means.
13:43:48 <mwc> shapr, it sounds like pure-math talk
13:44:06 <shapr> Which is not my forte.
13:44:54 <mwc> shapr, so you get paid to write haskell now?
13:44:58 <shapr> Sometimes, yeah.
13:45:01 <shapr> What about you?
13:45:36 <mwc> I'm getting paid this summer to model the decay of excited states in ion-trap quantum computer implentations
13:45:56 <shapr> That sounds immensely cool.
13:46:01 <shapr> Laser cooled even.
13:46:21 <mwc> basically to see how much random error is going to affect the implementation of a quantum computer.
13:46:54 <mwc> it's part of my supervising prof's project to quantify the limit of the theoretical limit of quantum computation in the presence of error
13:46:54 <skew> pay yourself from a few random bank accounts once you finish building it?
13:46:54 <shapr> Actually, laser cooling isn't required for ion trap qc, is it?
13:46:59 <shapr> haha!
13:47:29 <mwc> shapr, depends, thermal noise is noise
13:47:57 <mwc> but in practice no, you don't have to super cool it
13:48:15 <shapr> I think I read about doing quantum computing with Josephson junctions somewhere...
13:48:16 <skew> but it's cooler if you do :)
13:48:22 <mwc> skew, actually, NSERC gives the prof some extra money on his grant, to hire me
13:48:31 <liquidengineer> MY GOD
13:48:32 <shapr> That doesn't sound right. Hmmm.
13:48:33 <liquidengineer> it loaded
13:48:36 <mwc> it's supposed to get undergrads into research
13:48:41 <liquidengineer> I love you all
13:48:44 <liquidengineer> except the bot
13:48:49 <liquidengineer> It's a cheeky little fellow
13:48:50 * pesco hugs the bot.
13:48:52 <shapr> liquidengineer: you've been quoted saying that here before :-)
13:49:08 <liquidengineer> I have?
13:49:16 <KrispyKringle> So apparently a research lab in Singapore is developing a technology that uses touch sensors, vibrators, and remote techology to allow office workers who keep chicken as pets to interact with their fowl friends from afar.
13:49:20 <KrispyKringle> Screwy.
13:49:30 <pesco> Cool.
13:49:43 <shapr> liquidengineer: http://www.scannedinavian.org/AvianWiki/QuotesPage
13:49:50 <skew> liquidengineer: did you eliminate that "root" paramtere while you are at it?
13:49:50 <sorje> That's what happens when you get undergrads into research.. ;-P
13:50:01 <mwc> wow, you know, you coudl just use that for internet porn
13:50:14 <shapr> Man, you're desperate for chicks.
13:50:14 <mwc> but it's glad to see somebody's thinking of the chickens
13:50:20 <shapr> *bad dum*
13:50:25 <mwc> qui, moi?
13:50:33 <KrispyKringle> crap. i accidentally inverted the colors in my tv program when i hit the mouse, and i don't know how to fix it!
13:50:36 <shapr> Sorry, chickens <-> chicks
13:50:44 <shapr> KrispyKringle: C-z!
13:51:09 <shapr> Oh yeah, I remember!
13:51:24 <skew> are we done with that Java on the paste page?
13:51:49 <shapr> Recent research has discovered a way to teleport the signals when Josephson junctions.
13:52:02 <shapr> Forget wires, we'll just use the transporter.
13:52:37 <KrispyKringle> ah, i got it.
13:52:42 <shapr> heatsink recently wondered if there is a solution to the maximum connectedness problem with computing components.
13:53:17 <shapr> That is, if each component must be connected to each other, how to find a way to go below N! wires for N components?
13:53:43 <skew> stick them in a tree and fight over the bus, like an FPGA
13:53:44 <mwc> Bwahhaah
13:53:52 <mwc> Enterprise is ordered to deliver a mysterious cargo labelled only "WHIPS" to the planet Equus Mortis.
13:53:52 <mwc> funnies thing I've read all day
13:54:03 <shapr> oy
13:54:13 <shapr> That's way silly.
13:54:15 <wilx> Dead horse?
13:54:18 <shapr> beating
13:54:50 <shapr> skew: yeah, but with signal trasporting, you just send the signal.
13:54:57 <mwc> wilx, ye
13:55:18 <shapr> I guess this would allow real hypercubes as long as they fit within the signal distance.
13:55:38 <shapr> Would definitely cut down on memory access times.
13:56:19 <shapr> Is there some sane way to get josephson junctions working in my livingroom?
13:56:29 * shapr thinks
13:56:38 <liquidengineer> what are they?
13:56:38 <skew> I hear that cryocoolers are getting smaller and cheaper
13:56:48 <shapr> How cheap?
13:56:57 <shapr> Is it cheaper to build my own magnetic cooling system?
13:57:11 <shapr> I've heard mag cooling is efficient, but not powerful.
13:57:27 <skew> I don't know about that. Cheap enough to use in electronics for processing microwaves
13:57:54 <shapr> liquidengineer: j-junctions take about a thousandth of the power and time to switch compared to semiconductors. The downside is that they also require extremely low temperatures.
13:58:18 <skew> not the kind that you cook food with, the kind you send out an antenna
13:58:31 <wilx> Heh, so what you spare on the current you have to give back to the cooling? :)
13:58:32 <shapr> Liquid nitrogen cold, sadly not liquid co2 cold.
13:58:54 <skew> cryocooler == really fancy fridge
13:59:02 <shapr> skew: oh, I've read about those, that's cheaper for some value of really large corporation.
13:59:20 <shapr> That's the only commercial usage of jjunctions that I'm aware of.
13:59:54 <shapr> High speed signal switching, that is.
14:00:06 <skew> I doubt a magnetic cooling thing would go that low, if you are talking about spinning a disk of the right material that passes between some permenant magnets at one point
14:00:31 <shapr> Well, I know nearly zero about magnetic cooling.
14:00:55 <skew> that kind of system might theoretically work for a very mechanically simple and low power fridge
14:01:44 <shapr> I've been trying to think of a good way to force an energy sink to setup a heat gradient.
14:02:10 <skew> the other end is then if you take something with the (same) right magnetic properties, and cool it down to a few K in a magnetic field of a few T, it gets a lot colder if you suddenly turn off the magnetic field
14:02:21 <shapr> huh, neat
14:02:31 <shapr> hey, you might know this...
14:02:53 <shapr> do MRIs require perfectly aligned magnetic fields, or just faraday cage style magnetic fields?
14:04:10 <skew> I think the idea is that when there's a magetic field all the atoms have to line up, so all the entropy has to go to translational thermal motion, and when you turn it off they have more degrees of freedom so the energy spreads between them and the temperature drops
14:04:18 * poetix has a half-formed Monad.Reader article proposal for shapr
14:04:25 <shapr> poetix: oh yes! tell me more!
14:04:30 <skew> shapr: what is that about perfect alignment?
14:04:32 <shapr> skew: oh interesting!
14:04:48 <shapr> magnetic resonance imaging is about throwing radio waves at molecules.
14:05:12 <poetix> shapr: I want to polish up the sudoku solving code, add some recent polyomino puzzle solving code I've been working on, and write a short account of how to write solvers of this kind in Haskell
14:05:16 <shapr> depending on the flavor of test you're doing, you can find out bond length, strength, angle, component atoms, etc
14:05:28 <shapr> poetix: cool! yes!
14:05:31 <poetix> shapr: Time permitting, I might toss in a sokoban solver I've been thinking about
14:05:35 <shapr> Awesome!
14:05:45 <KrispyKringle> It's sick how I just spent the last 20 minutes or so reading the #haskell quotes page.
14:05:59 <KrispyKringle> Geeze. And there are half-naked girls wandering around outside.
14:06:08 <shapr> skew: the problem is that external magnetic fields throw off the results
14:06:13 <shapr> KrispyKringle: find anything interesting?
14:06:27 <poetix> They make good katas for the learning haskell programmer (me), and an interesting way into the declarative approach
14:06:47 <poetix> shapr: I see the STABS STUPID PROGRAMMERS IN THE FACE quote made it in
14:06:53 <shapr> skew: as far as I know, the only existing solution is a really massive multimillion dollar electromagnet
14:07:39 <shapr> poetix: yeah, but that's my personal quotes page, doesn't have to be on-topic really.
14:08:19 <shapr> skew: but I was thinking about using the meissner effect to create magnetic faraday cage.
14:08:48 <skew> I think that's totally off
14:08:55 <shapr> tell me
14:09:00 <skew> MRI uses absolutely huge magnetic fields
14:09:04 <shapr> yeah, but why?
14:09:07 <skew> like, just to work at all
14:09:14 <poetix> I visit the Daily WTF on a regular (daily, even) basis. It's always the greatest struggle not to post snippets of code by some, er, acquaintances of mine
14:09:18 <shapr> to align the molecules? to override external influences? or what?
14:09:29 <skew> the earth's magetic field and anything else is tiny by comparison
14:09:44 <KrispyKringle> shapr: yes. You're very prolific.
14:09:51 <shapr> bwahaa
14:09:55 <KrispyKringle> I like the <Alanna> Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OS's          is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders
14:10:37 * poetix tries to puzzle out a * once, ** anywhere quip, fails
14:10:39 <shapr> I have been thinking about taking a sabbatical and trying to write more code and less prose.
14:11:00 <tuomov> lol. the quotes page is great stuff... or I'm too drunk
14:11:11 <poetix> shapr: just write literate haskell on irc - compile the logs the following morning
14:11:16 <shapr> hah!
14:13:05 <SamB> umm...
14:13:30 <SamB> I think that could work with befunge...
14:14:05 <SamB> as long as the first line of your program only has one instruction.
14:14:19 <skew> http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/
14:14:21 <SamB> if nobody interrupted you
14:15:20 <skew> shapr: if you apply a magnetic field, atoms like to line up with it, but have higher energy states where they are pointed at an angle and precess around
14:15:43 <KrispyKringle> skew: OOh, ooh, what about the super-para magnetic effect?
14:15:51 <KrispyKringle> Actuator Man was telling me about this the other day!
14:16:22 <skew> like what happens to the energy levels of electron orbitals when atoms bond
14:16:42 <skew> KrispyKringle: I don't know what that is.
14:16:55 <KrispyKringle> skew: I'm just a lonely little bit.
14:16:58 <KrispyKringle> And on my back I sit.
14:17:08 <KrispyKringle> But how I long to be standing tall and singing free!
14:17:27 <KrispyKringle> http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html
14:17:30 <KrispyKringle> totally worth it
14:18:47 <shapr> skew: ah, I see.
14:19:26 <poetix> Two versions of unique: unique1 (x:xs) = foldr (\y ys -> if y `elem` ys then ys else y:ys) [x] xs
14:19:36 <poetix> unique2 = setToList . mkSet
14:19:37 <skew> so the radio pulse gives the atoms the energy to knock off axis and start precessing, and then you get some kind of signal as they decay back down
14:19:57 <skew> and the higher the magnetic field that faster that happens, I think
14:20:05 <poetix> Is unique1 better for short lists?
14:20:31 <skew> so that's at least one reason you want a huge magnetic field
14:20:32 <KrispyKringle> there's a unique?!
14:20:35 <KrispyKringle> dammit! i wrote one.
14:20:36 <skew> poetix: probably a bit
14:20:47 <poetix> @pointless unique1 (x:xs) = foldr (\y ys -> if y `elem` ys then ys else y:ys) [x] xs
14:20:48 <lambdabot> unique1 = s (foldr (s (s . flip s id . (if' .) . elem) (:)) . (: []) . head)
14:20:48 <lambdabot> tail
14:20:54 <poetix> ugh
14:20:59 <shapr> skew: That makes sense. I wonder if this can be combined with other means of aligning atoms.
14:23:15 <poetix> I tried some pentomino-generating code using Sets for everything, and noticed it was slower than just using the list-based unique at judicious intervals - there's an overhead to maintaining the Set invariants the whole time, as opposed to periodically de-duplicating a list
14:24:07 <poetix> Anyone know what the time complexity of the Set operations is?
14:25:26 <SamB> poetix: probably Okasaki
14:25:49 <monochrom> Those Sets are balanced binary search trees.
14:41:12 <astrolabe> If I were to buy one book to learn haskell from, which should it be?
14:47:48 <pesco> Does Cabal install the executables in the package description somehow? Or does it just build them?
14:48:54 <Lemmih> The latter.
14:49:01 <pesco> Wonderful!
14:49:10 * pesco hacks away cheerfully.
14:49:56 <KrispyKringle> astrolabe: as a perennial cheapskate, I'll recommend the free ebooks online :)
14:50:40 <skew> shapr: did you get Aardappel running?
14:50:56 <astrolabe> Thanks Krispy.
14:51:10 <skew> I'm hoping that if I have enough people look at it, then somebody will fix the bugs I'm seeing before I get around to them :)
14:51:58 <CosmicRay> shapr: is scannedinavian.org having some trouble?
14:56:24 <shapr> CosmicRay: don't think so, what's up?
14:57:28 <CosmicRay> can't get to the darcs wiki
14:57:34 <shapr> wfm
14:57:44 <CosmicRay> in fact, I can't even look up www.scannedinavian.org
14:57:55 <CosmicRay> err, there it went, but firefox just sits at "Connecting to www..."
14:59:48 <astrolabe> me too
15:00:10 <CosmicRay> sigh, and I was just going to add some links to the wiki! :-)
15:00:17 * CosmicRay lays on the guilt
15:01:24 <CosmicRay> gotta run, cya
15:10:07 <S4nD3r_> Is there any channel which persons are specialists in hacking art?
15:11:15 <pesco> Art. Yes.
15:11:36 * pesco waves his hands about in an elaborate manner.
15:29:04 <skew> wow, hitachi makes 500 GB drives
15:29:45 <monochrom> not yet 1 TB? :)
15:40:27 <pesco> Does the Cabal packaged with GHC not handle begin/end literate programs correctly?
15:42:03 <pesco> It doesn't seem to see my LANGUAGE pragma.

17:14:21 <SyntaxNinja> has anyone seen a bug in ghc 6.2 like this:
17:14:32 <SyntaxNinja> module A is mutually recursive wth module B
17:14:52 <SyntaxNinja> so I use a .hi-boot file for A and in B, say import {-source-} B
17:14:54 <SyntaxNinja> this works fine
17:15:01 <SyntaxNinja> but then module C imports B
17:15:21 <SyntaxNinja> but when building C with --make, it does not build A and fails while linking
17:15:26 <SyntaxNinja> ?
17:16:14 <dons> haven't seen that.
17:16:35 * SyntaxNinja doesn't follow ghc-users or ghc-bugs
17:17:19 <dons> C -> B --src-> A generally works
17:18:06 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: do you have any interest in writing up something about debian for hcar?
17:19:00 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: I think I did last time, can't remember
17:20:24 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: in that case, I'd encourage you to do that again if you have time
17:24:11 <SyntaxNinja> OK
17:40:52 <Igloo> Bah, lazy directory traversals are a real pain
17:41:43 <CosmicRay> are small scripts like arch2darcs worthy of mention on the haskell wiki?
17:45:26 <SyntaxNinja> unless Igloo wants to do it :)
17:45:37 <Igloo> huh?
17:45:54 <CosmicRay> yes, are you saying igloo would want to document my small scripts on the wiki?
17:48:53 * Igloo wishes paths went the other way
17:49:08 * CosmicRay is confused about this entire conversation?
17:49:12 <CosmicRay> s/?/./
17:49:38 <SyntaxNinja> does moinmoin back-end to a version control?
17:49:47 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: ?
17:56:16 <shapr> wha?
17:56:27 <SyntaxNinja> does it have flat files under or what?
17:56:34 <shapr> yes, flat files and backup copies
17:56:36 <CosmicRay> hmm, my entire scrollback is full of people not understanding the conversation
17:56:43 * CosmicRay converts his missingh repo to darcs
17:56:45 <SyntaxNinja> heh
17:56:54 <shapr> would be nice to use darcs instead
17:57:07 <SyntaxNinja> I'm saying igloo might want to do the debian report for HC&A
17:57:13 <CosmicRay> ahh
17:57:17 <CosmicRay> Igloo: what do you think?
17:57:19 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: why do you ask?
17:57:27 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: because someone asked me :)
17:57:40 <CosmicRay> Igloo: I'm thinking that you or syntax might want to write something on debian for hcar
17:58:05 <shapr> A nicer solution would be to switch everything to Flippi and add all the features.
17:58:21 <Igloo> We should write something, certainly, although we don't have an awful lot to say right now
17:58:22 <shapr> The development version of Flippi has excellent support for plugin extensions.
17:58:36 <shapr> Debian has marvy Haskell support, hurrah!
17:59:12 * CosmicRay is kinda psyched about arch2darcs.  it's the first useful, small, script-like application I've written in haskell.
17:59:18 <CosmicRay> most of my other haskell stuff is much larger stuff
17:59:32 <CosmicRay> now I'm finally getting to use it for tasks I would have used Python or bash for before
18:00:01 * Igloo is irritated about paths, list append and conversion to C strings
18:01:41 <CosmicRay> bah, only 497 changesets in missingh
18:03:04 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: in general?
18:03:14 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: have you used the FilePath module in cabal?
18:03:40 <Igloo> No - has it got any nifty performance tricks?
18:03:54 <SyntaxNinja> performance? it just munges file paths
18:04:23 <SyntaxNinja> @type Distribution.Compat.FilePath.splitFileName
18:04:27 <lambdabot> bzzt
18:04:37 <skew> CosmicRay: what kind of "larger stuff" would you write in bash?
18:04:38 <SyntaxNinja> hohum
18:04:53 <SyntaxNinja> skew: I think he's saying he wouldn't
18:05:15 <CosmicRay> skew: I wouldn't; I was saying arch2darcs is an example of a smaller thing that I might write in bash
18:05:23 <SyntaxNinja> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/Cabal/Distribution.Compat.FilePath.html
18:05:33 <CosmicRay> though parsing output of commands is a bit more complex than I'd care to do in bash
18:05:36 <Igloo> Syn: My problem is generating all paths in a directory tree quickly
18:05:52 <SyntaxNinja> couldn't have built cabal without it :) I think that this module would make python-type stuff much easier to build
18:05:54 <skew> most of the things I write in Haskell would otherwise have been larger programs in Python.
18:06:20 <skew> Certain sorts of text filtering get really small in Haskell
18:06:30 <CosmicRay> Igloo: would this be of use: http://quux.org/devel/missingh/html/MissingH.IO.HVFS.Utils.html#v%3ArecurseDir
18:06:33 <CosmicRay> skew: indeed
18:06:38 <CosmicRay> skew: though regexps are less convenient in haskell
18:06:40 <skew> main = interact $ unlines . nubBy isPrefixOf . lines
18:07:00 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Can I see the definition somewhere?
18:07:14 <CosmicRay> Igloo: one sec.
18:07:26 * SyntaxNinja gotsta go
18:07:32 <SyntaxNinja> have a good night all. might be back later.
18:08:16 <CosmicRay> Igloo: http://darcs.complete.org/missingh/MissingH/IO/HVFS/Utils.hs
18:08:47 <CosmicRay> this uses my HVFS/HVIO stuff, but you can trivially convert it to standard calls
18:08:56 <CosmicRay> or pass SystemFS as the first arg if you do use MissingH
18:09:28 <Igloo> That's essentially what I have now
18:16:37 <Igloo> Right, a splattering of reverses and the bottleneck is now elsewhere  :-)
18:20:04 <CosmicRay> heh
18:25:03 <CosmicRay> hmm, any particular reason hugs doesn't support installHandler?  Can hugs still receive SIGPIPE if trying to send data to a pipe whose remote end process has died?

19:55:56 <SyntaxNinja> I just put something on the paste page: can someone w/ experience in StateT check it out?
19:56:19 <SyntaxNinja> the question is about exception handling
19:56:43 <SyntaxNinja> in the call:runStateT (catchError (stateFun 1 >> stateErr  >> stateFun 2)
19:56:43 <SyntaxNinja> >                                   errorHandler)
19:56:43 <SyntaxNinja> >                        0
19:57:02 <SyntaxNinja> the change of state that should occur in stateFun 1 doesn't happen :(
19:57:09 <SyntaxNinja> though it performs IO, and that gets printed
20:18:27 * SamB is glad that flash, as a replacement for <blink>, is a bit less annoying on average, and wonders when mozilla will unimplement it.
20:18:42 <SamB> er, unimplement <blink>

20:36:02 <SyntaxNinja> did everyone fill out the GHC survey: 	http://www.haskell.org/ghc/survey/start.cgi
20:36:19 <Igloo> Can I claim the runner up prize with "internal error: Invalid object in processHeapClosureForDead"?
20:36:29 * Igloo has
20:37:08 <dons> ooh. rts errors are in a parallel category
20:37:35 <dons> @remember ghc internal error: Invalid object in processHeapClosureForDead
20:44:20 <Lemmih> Bah. I wake up 4mins after SyntaxNinja leaves ):

23:21:38 <stepcut> I got this really nice electric razor for my birthday last week
23:21:49 <stepcut> and tonight I accidently dropped it in the toilet :(
23:21:58 <desrt> are you 17?
23:22:03 <stepcut> no sir!
23:22:11 <desrt> did your father buy it for you, at least?
23:22:15 <stepcut> yes sir
23:22:30 <desrt> well, almost a weakerthans lyric, then
23:23:01 <stepcut> now I am really bummed, because it was really nice, and it's like $150 to get a new one :-(
23:25:39 <dons> stepcut!
23:25:56 <stepcut> dons!
23:26:06 <dons> :)

23:28:22 <sjanssen> does anyone know of any large graphs online?  are there digitized maps/airline schedules/etc that can be massaged into vertices and edges?
23:34:11 <skew> sjanssen: what are you planning on doing with the graph?
23:35:00 <sjanssen> skew: I had to write some graph code for a class, shortest path and such.  I wanted to stress test it, for fun
23:36:06 <skew> I see. I was hoping you had invented something neat that I would want to try out too.
23:36:24 <skew> I can't think of any place to get huge graphs
23:36:27 <skew> does google know?
23:37:27 <sjanssen> skew: seemingly not, or I can't think of the right terms at least
23:38:26 <skew> this might be interesting: http://lxr.linux.no/
23:39:32 <skew> If you found some way to download all the data, and figure out which linkes originate inside which objects, then that would give you a huge graph of the kernel
