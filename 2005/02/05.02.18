00:31:25 <autrijus> woot. I got larry wall started learning Haskell ;)
00:32:13 <TFK> The Perl guy?
00:35:17 <Itkovian> omg ... in perl 7 haskell will be integrated
00:37:21 <autrijus> actually, in perl6
00:37:23 <autrijus> ;)
00:37:42 <autrijus> Pugs is my perl6 interpreter implemented in haskell
00:37:54 <autrijus> one of the longer-term goals is to port it into perl6
00:38:11 <autrijus> and if there's something in haskell that is unreasonably hard in perl6
00:38:22 <autrijus> then it's a perl6 bug, and it will be fixed :)
00:40:49 <TFK> So what will become of Perl?
00:41:01 <autrijus> a multiparadigmic language as always?
00:42:33 <TFK> Just how many paradigms does a programmer need in one language? And will one's head not explode if they're too many?
00:42:51 <mflux> well, use just the subset you need?
00:43:19 <TFK> Temptation is too high.
00:43:49 <mflux> ..
00:44:02 <autrijus> I don't know, I think Curry and Oz are lovely.
00:44:17 <autrijus> and if Perl6 can become something on par with Curry and Oz I'd be very happy.
00:45:00 <mflux> I wonder though if static typing is a 'paradigm' we'll ever see in perl ;)
00:45:12 <autrijus> mflux: perl6 has static types :)
00:45:15 <autrijus> and subtypes, and type inference.
00:45:17 <mflux> hmm
00:45:21 <autrijus> it's been in the specs for a long time :)
00:45:37 <TFK> But isn't it weakly typed as well?
00:45:40 <mflux> hey, maybe perl6 will actually be useful then ;)
00:45:48 <autrijus> TFK: if you don't annotate, then it's all treated as Dynamic
00:45:56 <autrijus> and appropriate toDyn and fromDyn calls are added
00:45:58 <Itkovian> hmm, are there command line tools a la head that allow skipping the first n lines?
00:46:03 <autrijus> but if you annotate on eg. function signatures
00:46:07 <autrijus> then it assume static typing behaviour.
00:46:15 <mflux> itkovian, tail +42
00:46:16 <Itkovian> i seem to recall it existed, but can't find it anymore.
00:46:23 <TFK> Well, maybe. I'm not too familiar with Perl :-)
00:46:27 <mflux> or maybe -n +42
00:46:34 <TFK> By weak I mean that it does implicit type coercion.
00:46:42 <Itkovian> maybe that'll do
00:46:56 <Itkovian> i thought it had to do with +n, but heck ...
00:47:18 <autrijus> yeah, you can do sqrt("123abc") because sqrt is declared with a dynamic type argument.
00:47:34 <autrijus> but if you use a macro/pragma that forces a static type of sqrt(Num)
00:47:38 <autrijus> then it's a type error.
00:47:46 <autrijus> so all in all, you get to choose your bondages.
00:48:26 <Itkovian> mflux: neat. I tried head and tail in all possible forms, except that one.
00:48:39 <Itkovian> thx.
00:48:45 <mflux> happy to be of assistance
00:57:29 <lightstep> It there a standard monad transformer that is equivalent to T e m a = Either e (m a) ?
00:57:51 <autrijus> EitherT?
00:58:09 <autrijus> hmm no, never mind
00:59:12 <lightstep> If not, then how can I encode an errorful computation?
01:01:00 <wilx> Hnm...
01:01:03 <wilx> Now this is interesting.
01:01:29 <lightstep> wilx, what?
01:01:32 <wilx> I have checked out darcs's source and there is this _darcs/inventory directory.
01:01:32 <autrijus> lightstep: ErrorT?
01:02:07 <wilx> There are files like 20050204123805-53a90-0dd800d0ac994d011200792db11b8576b6889c1a.gz, notice the .gz suffix, despite the suffix the file are not compressed.
01:02:28 <wilx> s/inventory/inventories/
01:03:26 <lightstep> autrijus, I'll think about that for a while. The types just seem wrong.
01:04:57 <autrijus> lightstep: no, you can use the String as the Error type
01:06:55 <lightstep> Now I understand it.
01:08:11 <lightstep> Drawing some examples helped me.
01:42:08 <araujo> Hello here
01:43:27 <Itkovian> hi
02:14:24 <Forest> hi, i 've got a lame question: is haskel really better than lisp ?
02:15:03 <vincenz> is a screwdriver better than a hammer?
02:15:16 <TFK> To poke out eyes or bash heads?
02:15:55 <vincenz> that was in resposn to Forest
02:16:05 <Forest> does it mean they are for completely different purposes
02:16:36 <lightstep> Forest, they are for different paradigms
02:16:59 <Forest> ok, thanks
02:17:41 <lightstep> (which really means "I have no answer but I want to seem smart")
02:29:21 <mlh> i'm running winhugs, copy 'n pasting from the tute, but getting a syntax error:  unexpected =       wassup?
02:29:49 <TFK> You're trying to assign something?
02:30:12 <mlh> this: main _ = putChar ' ' >> putChar ' ' >> putChar ' ' >> mapM_ putStr (repeat "")
02:30:19 <TFK> Coz that don't work!
02:30:23 <mlh> yup
02:30:35 <TFK> Hugs doesn't allow assignment. You'll need to put it in a file and :load it.
02:31:07 <mlh> i know it isn't assignment.  but that's a literal copy from haskell docs
02:31:12 <TFK> or you could do 'let main _ = ... in main "foo"' or somesuch.
02:31:22 <TFK> Declaration, definition, whatever.
02:32:08 <TFK> In hugs you can only evaluate (yes, it sucks, I know :-( ). You should get ghc or another compiler if you want to write actual programs ;-)
02:32:30 <mlh> blimey
02:32:54 <mlh> ok.
02:33:02 <vikasgp> I've always wondered why you can't define functions in the top-level. Is there a technical reason?
02:33:12 <mlh> whats the best (or closest thing) to a ghc ide
02:33:24 <TFK> ide? emacs? :-P
02:33:39 <TFK> I know there's haskell mode, but I'm not really at any stage that requires an IDE :-(
02:34:13 <mlh> for windows.  I'm looking for the shortest route to a haskell program which does a window with a button saying hello world or whatever.  win32, tk, gtk doesn't matter
02:34:44 <TFK> wxHaskell and emacs are your best bet, I reckon.
02:35:54 <mlh> even on windows?
02:36:17 <TFK> emacs runs everyhwere.
02:36:25 <TFK> Or should I say, emacs runs everything :-/
02:36:26 <Forest> are there good IDEs for haskell &
02:37:00 <TFK> Then there's wxFruit. Although I personally didn't user either: http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs490/03-04b/bartholomew.robinson/
02:37:17 <TFK> You should learn the language first :-)
02:37:26 <mlh> hmm following graphics d/l from haskell.org; the win32 link is broken: http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/downloads/SOE.msi
02:38:03 <Forest> <TFK>: Good idea is a big help in learning )
02:38:09 <Forest> *IDE
02:38:12 <TFK> http://www.haskell.org/libraries/#guigs
02:38:36 <TFK> Ha! gedit + hugs + ghc banzai!
02:38:47 <TFK> They also list some other IDEs on that page.
02:39:11 <earthy> um. do you know eclipse?
02:39:18 <Forest> yes
02:39:23 <TFK> http://www.haskell.org/libraries/#ide <--- this, specifically
02:39:24 <earthy> there's some haskell support for eclipse
02:39:53 <earthy> syntax highlighting, compilation from the IDE (IIRC)
02:40:02 <earthy> no refactoring or such niceties though
02:40:07 <lightstep> vikasgp, the top level of GHCi (I don't know hugs, but it's probably the same) is executed is if in a big `do'. Therefore allowing only expressions, and the weird syntax for definitions. (This is not exactly `do', though, since it wraps print over non-IO values, and binds `it')
02:40:12 <akusai> earthy: if you mean eclipsefp, it is quite...erm...unfinished :)
02:40:20 <Forest> are there 'standart' IDEs like VS for C++ or IDEA for java )
02:40:22 <earthy> akusai: I stated `some' :)
02:40:47 <earthy> forest: simon m is working on VS integration in fact
02:41:01 <akusai> earthy: ...and buggy too :)
02:41:39 <Forest> ok, as i see there is nothing specially for the language )
02:42:43 <akusai> Forest: at one point, I was using editors with support for external tools (TextPad, EditPlus, UltraEdit) with ghc
02:44:01 <mlh> lightstep: you mentioned ghci.  is that part of some other package?  or part of the main ghc d/?
02:44:02 <redhatPT> hi
02:44:04 <redhatPT> can anyone help me with binary trees?
02:44:09 <vikasgp> lightstep, it tripped me up for quite a while when starting out ...
02:44:55 <lightstep> mlh, GHCi is the interpreter front-end of GHC
02:45:05 <mlh> ok ta
02:45:37 <lightstep> redhatPT, it depends on the question.
02:45:53 <akusai> redhatPT: why would anyone need help with that? ;)
02:46:29 <TFK> akusai, gardening services ^_^
02:46:53 <redhatPT> akusai *g* :(
02:47:17 <Forest> hugs & hgs - just 2 different compilers or there are more differences
02:47:31 <Forest> *hugs & ghc
02:47:40 <redhatPT> ohh
02:47:46 <redhatPT> hugs is an interpreter
02:47:51 <redhatPT> and ghc is a compiler
02:48:03 <redhatPT> <lightstep> mlh, GHCi is the interpreter front-end of GHC
02:48:33 <lightstep> Forest, there are minor differences, mostly in the advanced features (language extentions and esoteric libraries).
02:48:53 <redhatPT> lightstep check your pm's plz
02:49:07 <lightstep> pm?
02:49:17 <redhatPT> private message?!
02:49:40 <lightstep> Sorry, using a new client.
03:18:45 <jlouis> is there a distributed haskell?
03:32:30 <Itkovian> http://www.elis.ugent.be/~ageorges/align.hs
03:32:34 <Itkovian> remarks are most welcome.
03:32:49 <Itkovian> the goal is to 'align' rows in files
03:33:09 <Itkovian> e.g. file 1 -> a a b b c, file 2 -> a a b c would yield a a b c
03:33:59 <Itkovian> moreover, a line consists of a tag and some values. we align on the tag field, and we change t1 v1 t1 v2 to t1 v1++v2
03:34:41 <jlouis> how many lines of awk(1) would this be?
03:34:55 <Itkovian> I have no idea ;-)
03:35:04 <Itkovian> I could try, if I find some time.
03:35:31 <Itkovian> can you open an unspecified number of fles in awk?
03:35:36 <Itkovian> s/fles/files/
03:38:28 <jlouis> Do you need to? cat(1) can, and awk(1) reads nicely from a pipe
03:38:51 <jlouis> it seems it reads an arbitrary amount of files though
03:41:46 <Itkovian> but you'd need to process them simultaneously. or am I missing something?
03:50:56 <marcot> Hello.
03:51:06 <Itkovian> hi
03:51:07 <marcot> I'm having a problem with classes declaration.
03:51:30 <marcot> I have declared a class inDatabase, and then made an instance of inDatabse Object.
03:51:48 <marcot> This Object data type has also an instance in the class Intervalled.
03:52:12 <marcot> Then, in the definition of a function on the instance inDatabase Object, I'v e used a Intervalled function.
03:52:25 <marcot> So, ghci's saying:
03:52:34 <marcot>     Ambiguous type variable `i' in these top-level constraints:
03:52:44 <marcot>       `Intervalled i'
03:52:53 <marcot> 	arising from use of `updateFinalTime' at ./Database.hs:71
03:52:59 <marcot>       `InDatabase i' arising from use of `setl' at ./Database.hs:71
03:53:30 <marcot> updateFinalTime is the Intervalled function.
03:53:36 <marcot> When I put the type explicity in the code, it works.
03:54:06 <marcot> But I can't get why in the instance of inDatabase Object it doesn't know that the type of the function is an Object.
03:54:34 <Itkovian> marcot: maybe that's the answer ... if haskell tries to derive the type, it might need a nudge?
03:55:08 <marcot> Itkovian: actually now that I've explained it all here, I think I got to the point.
03:55:38 <lightstep> marcot, with separate compilation, there can be many types that are both Intervalled and InDatabase, and it can't know the correct one.
03:55:45 <marcot> Looks like there's nothing on the function that can make it knows which type to use, cause this function doesn't take i as a parameter.
03:55:55 <Itkovian> there ya go!
03:55:58 <Itkovian> :-)
03:56:10 <marcot> =) Thanks anyway!
04:14:51 <Itkovian> yw
04:29:41 * boegel greets #haskell
04:29:49 * Itkovian greets boegel
04:30:31 <boegel> can anybody tell e if shapr is here ? I'm on a plaintext irc client which doesn't show the users list
04:30:39 <boegel> s/e/me
04:30:45 <Itkovian> @seen shapr
04:30:45 <lambdabot> I saw shapr leaving #haskell 21 hours 5 minutes 26 seconds ago.
04:30:53 <boegel> oh, stupid me :)
04:31:02 <Itkovian> btw, boegel, my script is finished.
04:31:28 <boegel> Itkovian: script ? your parse thingie?
04:31:37 <Itkovian> erm ... the align thingie
04:34:56 <redhatPT> can anyone explain me what an instance is?
04:35:53 <waltz> On object created by instantiating a class or function?
04:35:57 <waltz> An*
04:36:05 <waltz> ...
04:36:31 <waltz> I'm using another language in context though; I don't program in Haskell.
04:36:39 <redhatPT> lol
04:36:41 <Itkovian> imho, an instance is a datatype on which the class functions have been defined
04:36:46 <Itkovian> in haskell that is.
04:36:48 <waltz> But concepts are usually transparent ;p
04:36:57 <boegel> waltz: so why doe you ask here ?
04:36:59 <Itkovian> in java e.g. an instance is an object of a certain type
04:37:08 <waltz> I didn't ask.
04:37:13 <waltz> redhatPT asked.
04:37:16 <waltz> I responded.
04:37:17 <redhatPT> yep
04:37:19 <waltz> Please read.
04:37:21 <Itkovian> waltz: I think the class concept in Haskell is somewhat different from tradiditonal OO class concepts
04:37:45 <waltz> No, your definition fits the defintion of my language too.
04:37:53 <boegel> waltz: sorry :)
04:38:03 <waltz> np at all.
04:38:16 <Itkovian> well well
04:38:18 <Itkovian> <redhatPT> can u give me an example of an instance
04:38:21 <mlh> TFK: thanks for the suggestion of wxhaskell.
04:38:23 <Itkovian> <redhatPT> I have an exam and I dunno that
04:38:25 <Itkovian> eh?
04:38:26 <mlh> looking good
04:38:51 <Itkovian> an Int is an example of the Show class.
04:39:04 <Itkovian> if you have an exam, you shoudl have studied.
04:39:44 <Itkovian> otoh if yr teacher let su use irc ....
04:39:53 <waltz> Where did he say that he had an exam?
04:40:01 <Itkovian> privately to me
04:40:08 <waltz> ah
04:40:10 <Itkovian> but he says he is not @ the exam ...
04:40:16 <Itkovian> <redhatPT> i'm not @ the exam..
04:40:16 <Itkovian> <redhatPT> its @ 2.00 pm
04:40:23 <redhatPT> so what?
04:40:30 <redhatPT> can't I ask?
04:40:32 <redhatPT> *G*
04:40:38 <Itkovian> well, if you are at an exam, you should do it yrself.
04:40:38 <waltz> An exam on OO languages or on Haskell in specific?
04:40:43 <Itkovian> we have to do the same at ours.
04:40:56 <redhatPT> omfg dude!
04:41:01 <waltz> :|
04:41:02 <Itkovian> if yr studying for an exam, that's something different.
04:41:08 <redhatPT> duhh
04:41:16 <Itkovian> so.
04:41:18 <Itkovian> anyway.
04:41:20 <waltz> Can you stop saying "yr"; proper word is "your".
04:41:25 <Itkovian> as I said. Int is an instance of class Show
04:41:29 <waltz> "yr" is shorthand for "year".
04:41:36 <Itkovian> waltz: all right.
04:41:47 <waltz> Sorry, it's just a little confusing.
04:41:48 <Itkovian> I gathered the context wouldmake that clear.
04:42:02 <Itkovian> hmm.
04:42:10 <Itkovian> I meant you're of course.
04:42:24 <waltz> well, yea.
04:42:33 <Itkovian> redhatPT: be more specific ...
04:43:01 <redhatPT> k
04:43:30 <redhatPT> like
04:43:44 <redhatPT> class FigFechada a where
04:43:44 <redhatPT> area :: a -> Float
04:43:44 <redhatPT> perimetro :: a -> Float
04:43:44 <redhatPT> fun figs = filter (\fig -> (area fig) > 100) figs
04:43:54 <redhatPT> and
04:44:01 <redhatPT> type Ponto = (Float,Float)
04:44:01 <redhatPT> type Lado = Float
04:44:01 <redhatPT> data Rectangulo = PP Ponto Ponto
04:44:01 <redhatPT> | PLL Ponto Lado Lado
04:44:14 <Itkovian> that defines a number of functions instances of FigFechada should 'implement'
04:44:15 <boegel> redhatPT: you should use the paste page
04:44:37 <Itkovian> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
04:44:38 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
04:44:51 <TFK> mlh, er? it actually works? :-P
04:44:53 <redhatPT> i have to declare Rectangulo as instance of FigFechada class.
04:45:09 <mlh> heh.  well, helloworld does.
04:45:31 <redhatPT> boegelq didn't know! sorry
04:45:38 <TFK> coo :-)
04:45:53 <mlh> first steps.  so far so good.  (i haven't spent all this tim trying to get it work btw :-)
04:46:43 <Itkovian> redhatPT: instance FigFechada Rectangulo where area :: Rectangulo -> Float and then define area
04:48:22 <redhatPT> hummm
04:49:55 <redhatPT> k thx
04:50:05 <redhatPT> got to lunch before the exam
04:50:08 <redhatPT> thank m8
04:50:12 <redhatPT> c u l8r
04:51:00 <Itkovian> all right. good luck.
04:51:04 <redhatPT> ty
04:52:55 <Itkovian> I just ran my align program on 5 trace files of each about 20 MB.
04:53:06 <Itkovian> however, I found that my app is using over 800 MiB
04:53:23 * Philippa_ is tempted to point out that the byte is not an SI unit so they can go shove it...
04:53:32 <Itkovian> I am open for any suggestions ...
04:53:33 <Itkovian> eh?
04:53:36 <Itkovian> 800 MiB then
04:53:51 <Itkovian> and 20MiB
04:53:57 <Itkovian> which happen to be SI units
04:54:05 * Philippa_ shrugs
04:54:10 <Itkovian> liek I always have to point out to reviewers of my papers.
04:54:49 <Philippa_> except they're really SI prefixes added to a non-SI unit that they're trying to co-opt
04:54:52 <TFK> What's MiB?
04:55:10 <Philippa_> what the SI want everybody to call a mega(=2^20)byte
04:55:16 <boegel> TFK: mebibyte, as in 1024 KiB
04:55:37 <TFK> SI? o.o
04:56:01 <TFK> And KiB is...
04:56:05 <lightstep> Fritz defined an information unit, the respective MKS quantity being bit.
04:56:10 <TFK> What's wrong wit the normal byte notation? o.o
04:56:16 <lightstep> So SI can do it as well.
04:56:17 <Itkovian> Philippa_: how would you define a 'standard' (nowadays) unit of storage then?
04:56:20 <TFK> Fritz? The chip? o_O
04:56:44 <lightstep> TFK, no, the language. It was somewhen on LTU
04:57:17 <TFK> Oh. I'm not a very active LtU reader :-(
04:58:55 <boegel> TFK: the problem is it's never really clear when someone means 1000 or 1024 bytes when they say 1 MB
04:59:14 <boegel> s/MB/KB
04:59:37 <boegel> KiB solves this -> 1 KiB = 1024 bytes, 1 KB = 1000 bytes
04:59:40 <TFK> Yes, that's true.
05:00:17 <TFK> Oh.
05:00:51 <Itkovian> well, for disk storage one is supposed to use MB.GB.TB, for RAM-related stuff one uses KiB/MiB/GiB
05:02:37 <TFK> Why not use KiB/MiB/GiB for disk storage as well, and then have XB = XiB? Then everything would be as it should have been in the first place :-)
05:03:20 <Itkovian> yes, except that harddrive manufacturers use decimal KB stuff, and people complain that their drive isn;t exactly 40GiB, but only 40GB
05:03:22 <Forest> it is marketing trick i think )
05:03:39 <TFK> Yeah. They should be beat with a stick.
05:03:53 <Forest> absolutely
05:03:54 <Forest> true
05:04:09 <Itkovian> Idd.
05:04:23 <Forest> haskel seems to be a cool thing
05:04:29 <Philippa_> lightstep: the issue for me with what the SI're doing is that they're /redefining/ units
05:04:35 <TFK> It is :-)

06:58:40 <marcot> Hello.
07:00:00 <lightstep> Good afternoon.
07:00:54 <marcot> Can I make a function in a class that doesn't receive the class type as a parameter? And then how can I choose which instance I'll use when I call the function?
07:00:59 <marcot> Something like:
07:01:05 <marcot> class Intervalled i => InDatabase i where
07:01:14 <marcot> destroy :: Key -> Time -> Database -> Database
07:01:32 <marcot> Where destroy is member of InDatabase.
07:02:36 <lightstep> From the example, it seems that destroy is a _value_, while InDatabase is a _type_ class.
07:02:38 <marcot> And when I make two instances, say, InDatabase Object and InDatabase Action, how can I choose which one I'll use?
07:03:11 <marcot> lightstep: destroy is a function that is in the InDatabase type class.
07:03:26 <marcot> But it doesn't take the class type as a parameter.
07:03:37 <marcot> So, how can I indicate what instance will be used?
07:04:01 <lightstep> There's a wiki page about it.
07:04:25 <marcot> lightstep: Can you give me the link?
07:04:35 <musasabi> How could I debug problems with "schedule: re-entered unsafely. Perhaps a 'foreign import unsafe' should be 'safe'?" in GHC?
07:04:59 <lightstep> @wiki TraitsTypeclass
07:05:00 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/TraitsTypeclass
07:05:31 <marcot> lightstep: thanks.
07:05:48 <musasabi> I can run the code normally, but if I try to stress test it, it dies with that.
07:08:58 <Si\> does hs-plugin work with Data.Typeable in GHC 6.4, or does it still need Altdata.Typeable?
07:09:05 <musasabi> In particular the problematic peace of code is putStrLn "foo" >> call_c_function_marked_as_thread_safe_which_will_block >> putStrLn "bar"
07:09:13 <marcot> Ok, now other problem have appeared.
07:09:16 <musasabi> And it does between those two putStrLns
07:09:31 <marcot> This destroy function has the same definition for all instances.
07:10:17 <Forest> for what tasks is haskell used in practice
07:11:25 <CosmicRay> hello aj, didn't know you were interested in haskell
07:12:15 <CosmicRay> and man that motd pie chart fundraiser thing is hideous.  must mean lilo's rent is due, eh? :-)
07:13:31 <marcot> But the problem is that I must know the type that  it was called in the code.
07:13:40 <marcot> Something like:]
07:13:48 <marcot>     destroy :: Key -> Time -> Database -> Database
07:13:57 <marcot>     destroy _ k t d
07:14:07 <marcot>     destroy _ k t d
07:14:18 <marcot> 	= setl ((updateFinalTime t $ getThis k t d) : notThis k t d) d
07:14:54 <lou-tse> marcot: hm...i don't see the phantom arg here
07:15:09 <marcot> Sorry..
07:15:21 <marcot> I have a little problem with copying and pasting.
07:15:31 <marcot>     destroy :: i -> Key -> Time -> Database -> Database
07:15:34 <marcot> Not it's ok.
07:15:40 <marcot> Now it's ok.
07:15:55 <lou-tse> well?
07:16:08 <lou-tse> you insist that it still has the same imp for all instances???
07:16:26 <marcot> The problem is that when I use :: [i] after notThis k t d...
07:16:57 <marcot> It sayd that InDatabase i could not be deduced from context.
07:17:02 <marcot> said.
07:17:20 <marcot> But I don't understand why it doesn't use the same i of the class declaration.
07:18:19 <lou-tse> what do you mean, "use :: [i] after notThis k t d..." ?
07:18:26 <lou-tse> can you paste the code?
07:18:39 <marcot> 	= setl ((updateFinalTime t $ getThis k t d) : notThis k t d :: [i]) d
07:19:35 <lou-tse> i think :: [i] actually binds to d here - are you sure that this is what you mean?
07:19:52 <marcot> It doesn't understand that the i in this is the same i of the class.
07:20:12 <marcot> It gives me this:
07:20:29 <marcot> Ambiguous type variable `i' in the top-level constraint:
07:20:34 <marcot> `InDatabase i' arising from use of `setl' at ./Database.hs:72
07:20:42 <marcot> setl is:
07:20:50 <marcot> setl :: [i] -> Database -> Database
07:21:10 <marcot> So it knows that the first parameter of setl is [i].
07:21:14 <marcot> From the class.
07:21:39 <lou-tse> ahem...i wonder, what would happen if you moved the ::[i] just outside the parentheses? :)
07:21:40 <marcot> But it does not understand that the i in this case is the same of the function phantom parameter.
07:22:26 <lou-tse> like this: setl ((updateFinalTime t $ getThis k t d) : notThis k t d)::[i] d
07:22:30 <marcot> 	= setl (((updateFinalTime t $ getThis k t d) : notThis k t d) :: [i]) d
07:22:38 <marcot> Same error.
07:23:22 <lou-tse> hm...what's the signature for updateFinalTime?
07:24:50 <marcot>     updateFinalTime :: Time -> i -> i
07:24:54 <marcot> in class Intervalled i where
07:25:51 <musasabi> It seems this is related to concurrency and threaded rts :-(
07:26:21 <Oejet> musasabi: Sounds interesting.  Found a bug?
07:28:25 <musasabi> Oejet: I know where it is occuring, but how and why are not entirely clear.
07:29:47 <lou-tse> marcot: sounds really weird to me - gotta go now, but will dig into it later
07:29:52 <musasabi> Somehow the scheduler is entered before resumeThread is called... But that should not be possible.
07:30:57 <marcot> lou-tse: ok, thanks.
07:31:19 <marcot> I'll try to look for that, I don't know why ghc is behaving this way.
07:31:55 <musasabi> The assembler output seems quite clear - resumeThread and suspendThread are called correctly... The problem remains - how can it not be in_askell...
07:31:59 <musasabi> *in_haskell
07:37:55 <marcot> Can someone explain me that? I don't know even where to search for this kind of documentation, and ghc is not vehaving as I expect.
07:38:23 <marcot> So this could possibly be a ghc bug.
07:38:31 <marcot> behaving
07:38:55 <Itkovian> hmm ... read fails to parse.
07:39:04 <Itkovian> nontheless, there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary
07:49:13 <lightstep> Itkovian, this "ordinary" seems quite bad.
07:50:30 <Forest> for what tasks is haskell used in practice
07:52:18 <musasabi> hmm that bug chose to revisit me...
07:52:41 <lightstep> Forest, see haskell.org/practice.html
07:52:41 <Itkovian> lightstep: well, it seems to fail after a number of lines ...
07:52:42 <musasabi> on average in 1/50000 runs...
07:54:25 <Itkovian> i'm off
08:03:09 <Oejet> musasabi: Can you reproduce it?   Can I test it too?
08:05:20 <musasabi> Oejet: I am getting it with epoll code when throwing a load test against it.
08:07:19 <musasabi> Oejet: if you want I can post it somewhere...
08:07:41 <Oejet> musasabi: I'd like that.
08:24:07 <roconnor> hey, anyone here use Haskell?
08:24:34 <xerox> somebody does
08:24:46 <autrijus> no. Haskell uses us.
08:24:54 <autrijus> exploits us, represses us, controls us!
08:25:00 <autrijus> gollum, gollum!
08:26:25 <Oejet> It's mine, my own, my precious Haskell.
08:28:37 <roconnor> Would someone be willing to check to see if a definition is admissible?
08:28:55 <roconnor> I installed TeXmacs and it got rid of my ghc :-(
08:29:26 <roconnor> data Term A = Var A | App (Term A) (Term A) | Lambda (Term (Maybe A))
08:29:41 <kosmikus> s/A/a/
08:29:48 <roconnor> ah yes
08:29:49 <kosmikus> except App
08:30:09 <kosmikus> otherwise, it looks fine
08:34:17 <tromp> what is the Maybe good for?
08:37:07 <roconnor> So it works with the lowercase type variables?
08:37:28 <roconnor> (Maybe A) is the type A with one extra element added.
08:38:16 <roconnor> Is there an empty data type in Haskell?
08:38:57 <xerox> Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
08:41:31 <tromp> but what's the intended meaning of a term like Lambda (Var Nothing) ?
08:41:48 <roconnor> that would be \x. x
08:43:02 <roconnor> Lambda $ Lambda $ Var $ Just Nothing is \x. \y. x
08:43:31 <roconnor> Lambda $ Lambda $ Var $ Nothing is \x. \y. y
08:43:52 <roconnor> replace Nothing with zero, and Just with successor, and think de Bruijn indexes
08:44:00 <tromp> ah! so you use Maybe as a unary representation of de-bruijn index
08:44:21 <roconnor> indeed
08:44:41 <tromp> and you never instantiate the type a
08:44:44 <esap> nice use of natural numbers.
08:45:01 <roconnor> a is the type of the free variables.
08:45:15 <roconnor> for closed lamba terms it should be the empty data type.
08:46:00 <roconnor> I'm sure someone must have thought of this before.  I must investigate.
08:46:16 <roconnor> btw, Term is also a Monad.
08:46:27 <roconnor> Var is return
08:46:53 <roconnor> and bind is substituion, which I should write down ...
08:48:05 <tromp> nice approach
08:48:41 * esap uses completely different representation for lambda. I have lambda as one alternative for representation of TAdjunction type :-)
08:48:45 <roconnor> sub (Var a) f = f a
08:48:47 <roconnor> sub (App t1 t2) f = App (sub t1 f) (sub t2 f)
08:48:48 <roconnor> sub (Lambda t) f = Lambda (sub t (liftM f))
08:48:56 * esap wonders how de-bruijn indices work for that.
08:49:09 <roconnor> I think that is right,  But whatever, that would be bind.
08:49:20 <roconnor> I think I got the parameters backwards.
08:49:28 <esap> you can get arrows as well easily
08:49:57 * esap uses arrow representation for terms.
08:50:00 <roconnor> I'm not as familiar with the arrows data type.
08:50:31 <tromp> is that liftM working on the Maybe monad?
08:50:36 <roconnor> yes
08:51:14 <tromp> have you come up with a nice Show instance for your Terms?
08:51:40 <roconnor> I haven't done much with this yet. ... no ghc right now.
08:51:47 <roconnor> I just thought of this yesterday.
08:52:17 <roconnor> When surfing the web I saw Terms as Monads somewhere, and I was thinking about it again last night.
08:54:57 <roconnor> anyone want to typecheck my definition of sub?
09:00:14 <tromp>     Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: a = Maybe a
09:00:14 <tromp>         Expected type: Term (Maybe a)
09:00:14 <tromp>         Inferred type: Term a
09:00:14 <tromp>     In the application `sub t (liftM f)'
09:00:14 <tromp>     In the first argument of `Lambda', namely `(sub t (liftM f))'
09:01:23 <roconnor> :-/
09:03:27 <roconnor> sub t (liftM f) was intended to have type Term (Maybe a)
09:03:49 <roconnor> oh
09:03:57 <roconnor> I don't think liftM is right
09:04:07 <roconnor> @type liftM
09:04:08 <lambdabot> bzzt
09:04:19 <roconnor> @type Monad.liftM
09:04:20 <lambdabot> Monad.liftM :: forall r m a1. (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
09:04:41 * roconnor thinks
09:05:08 <roconnor> @type maybe
09:05:09 <lambdabot> maybe :: forall b a. b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
09:05:59 <roconnor> sub (Lambda t) f = Lambda (sub t (maybe (Var Nothing) F))
09:06:03 <roconnor> how about that?
09:06:59 <roconnor> s/F/f
09:07:14 <tromp>     Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: a = Maybe a
09:07:14 <tromp>         Expected type: Term (Maybe a)
09:07:14 <tromp>         Inferred type: Term a
09:07:14 <tromp>     In the application `sub t (maybe (Var Nothing) f)'
09:07:14 <tromp>     In the first argument of `Lambda', namely
09:07:14 <tromp>         `(sub t (maybe (Var Nothing) f))'
09:08:26 <roconnor> hmmm
09:08:55 <roconnor> this calls for a whiteboard
09:11:35 <tromp> or a napkin
09:12:01 <tromp> first make a simle example f
09:14:48 <roconnor> sub (Lambda t) f = Lambda (sub t (thingy f))
09:14:49 <roconnor>  where
09:14:51 <roconnor>   thingy (Just a) = (sub a Just)
09:14:53 <roconnor>   thingy Nothing = (Var Nothing)
09:15:08 <roconnor> this is harder than I had imagined
09:15:57 <tromp> thingy expects a Maybe, not an f
09:16:06 <roconnor> oops
09:16:08 <roconnor> duh
09:16:39 <roconnor> righ
09:17:14 <tromp> suppose you have an
09:17:16 <tromp> f Nothing = Var 0
09:17:16 <tromp> f x = Var x
09:17:48 <tromp> how to make that work?
09:17:59 <roconnor>   thingy f (Just a) = (sub (f a) Just)
09:18:01 <roconnor>   thingy f Nothing = (Var Nothing)
09:18:28 * roconnor remains seckptical
09:19:05 <tromp> why not thingy f a?
09:19:31 <roconnor> thingy :: (a -> Term b) -> Maybe a -> Term (Maybe b)
09:19:54 <roconnor> or thats the goal
09:20:05 <roconnor> feel free to put thingy at the top level, and test its type
09:20:17 <roconnor> oh wait
09:20:19 <roconnor> it calls sub
09:20:26 <roconnor> I don't like that it calls sub.
09:25:58 <tromp> if
09:26:00 <tromp> false = Lambda $ Lambda $ Var Nothing
09:26:00 <tromp> true = Lambda $ Lambda $ Var (Just Nothing)
09:26:05 <tromp> and
09:26:09 <tromp> f Nothing = Var 0
09:26:10 <tromp> f x = Var x
09:26:22 <tromp> then what should be sub true f ?
09:26:40 <tromp> and what should be sub false f?
09:28:24 <roconnor> sub true f  and sub false f are not well typed.
09:28:48 <roconnor> in both cases since all the variables are bound sub should be the identity
09:30:29 <roconnor> at times like these, I'm glad haskell is strongly typed.
09:33:45 <tromp> test = Lambda $ App (Var Nothing) (Var Just 0)
09:33:49 <tromp> f 0 = false
09:33:49 <tromp> f x = Var x
09:34:06 <tromp> what about sub test f ?
09:35:28 <roconnor> f is still the wrong type
09:35:35 <roconnor> f 0 = Var false
09:35:38 <roconnor> f x = Var true
09:35:42 <roconnor> that would be better
09:36:03 <roconnor> then you should get Lambda $ App (Var Nothing) (Var Just false)
09:36:12 <tromp> surely you want to be able to sub a nonvar for a var?
09:36:23 <roconnor> yes
09:36:46 <roconnor> you could make f 0 = (App (Var false) (Var true))
09:37:19 <tromp> that seems same type as mine
09:37:20 <roconnor> and get Lambda $ App (Var Nothing) (App (Var (Just false)) (Var Just true)))
09:38:03 <tromp> Var false looks wrong to me
09:38:13 <tromp> false is already a Term a
09:38:20 <roconnor> oopps
09:38:22 <roconnor> sorry
09:38:24 <roconnor> my bad
09:38:34 <roconnor> I was thinking of False
09:38:36 <bourbaki> moin
09:38:53 <roconnor> sub (Lambda t) f = Lambda (sub t (thingy f))
09:38:54 <tromp> i try to sub a term for 0
09:38:55 <roconnor>   where
09:38:57 <roconnor>    thingy :: (a -> Term b) -> (Maybe a) -> Term (Maybe b)
09:38:58 <roconnor>    thingy f Nothing = Var Nothing
09:39:01 <roconnor> is a partial defintion
09:39:06 <roconnor> and it doesn't unify.
09:39:11 <roconnor> I think I am screwed.
09:40:00 <roconnor> and it is dinner time

10:51:23 <Oeje1> TFK: Last year it was that easy.
10:51:49 <lightstep> ICFP is so much better then the imperative Informatics Olimpiad
10:51:50 <TFK> Easy enough.
10:52:05 <TFK> And one SPOJ to rule them... err...
10:54:15 <Heffalump> June is quite a long time away.
10:54:30 * Heffalump is looking forward to it :-)
10:56:39 * vincenz too
10:56:42 <vincenz> I'm SO BOUNCY
10:56:44 <vincenz> like a rotten egg
10:58:35 * Heffalump hopes kosmikus, Igloo and duncan_ are available again
10:59:51 * vincenz should learn haskell so he can do it in haskell
10:59:58 <vincenz> I've done it in a different lang every year :P
11:00:15 <TFK> Only functional languages are allowed?
11:00:22 <Heffalump> no, any language
11:00:29 <Heffalump> usually the problem favours functional languages
11:00:34 <vincenz> yip
11:00:37 <Heffalump> functional languages have won every year but 1
11:00:39 <vincenz> and usually the problem requires reasoning
11:00:47 <vincenz> not "how do you use functionXYZ in windowsé
11:00:52 <Heffalump> Haskell is the current champion.
11:01:02 <vincenz> ocaml will be the next
11:01:04 <vincenz> MuHAHAHAHA
11:01:05 <TFK> Hmmm.
11:01:08 * vincenz coughs
11:01:14 <TFK> No. Python. ^_^
11:01:21 <lightstep> Were any languages champions except Haskell, Ocaml and C++?
11:01:22 <Heffalump> vincenz: what did you enter in last year?
11:01:30 <Heffalump> lightstep: Cilk, IIRC
11:02:13 <vincenz> Heffalump: hmm?
11:02:16 <vincenz> man this sux
11:02:22 <vincenz> directdraw won't work in windows :/
11:02:26 <vincenz> I mean vmware
11:03:02 <vincenz> ;4:/
11:03:05 <vincenz> :/
11:03:27 <vincenz> oh well
11:03:44 <vincenz> woo
11:03:45 <vincenz> it works
11:03:45 <Heffalump> Cilk won in 1998, OCaml in 1999, 2000, Haskell in 2001, OCaml in 2002, C++ in 2003, Haskell in 2004.
11:04:05 <Heffalump> so one more win for Haskell and it'll catch up
11:04:05 <vincenz> slow as hell but it works
11:04:21 <rtega> how different is ocaml from haskell btw?
11:04:22 * autrijus wonders idly if Perl6 can be used to win 2005
11:04:31 <Heffalump> I don't think it has type classes.
11:04:48 <vincenz> and it's non pure
11:04:51 <TFK> It's strict, or so I hear.
11:04:57 <vincenz> I don't know haskell
11:05:01 * Heffalump decides to email his team from last year to get the ball rolling.
11:05:03 <vincenz> but I know that I would liek type classes in haskell
11:05:08 <vincenz> Heffalump: can I join?
11:05:16 <TFK> You compete in teams? o_O
11:05:18 <vincenz> it might give me a reason to learn haskell
11:05:44 <Oeje1> TFK: It seems you don't know anything about the contest.
11:05:55 <TFK> You are correct.
11:06:24 <wli> ICFP eh?
11:06:32 <Oeje1> TFK:  http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest/index.php  from last year.
11:06:40 <TFK> The situation is not helped by the fact that the official competition site seems to have no informative links whatsoever.
11:06:46 <Heffalump> vincenz: ideally we'll be aiming at being in the same physical location and keeping the same team as last year together.
11:06:47 <TFK> mmm, thanks ^_^
11:09:05 <Heffalump> I should do more to exercise my bragging rights.
11:12:15 <Oeje1> Heffalump: I guess you kicked my butt so much in that contest. :-P
11:12:38 <Heffalump> we kicked everyone's butts :-)
11:13:11 <wli> heffalump: in '98?
11:13:30 <Heffalump> no, in '04
11:13:35 <Heffalump> '98 was when Cilk won
11:13:43 <wli> Heffalump: You were on the winning team in '04? wow
11:14:27 <Oeje1> I really liked the problem.
11:14:29 <Heffalump> as were Igloo, kosmikus and duncan_ (although duncan seems not to be here)
11:14:41 <Heffalump> (hence the name "Dunkosmiloolump")
11:14:59 <lightstep> Wasn't you group bragging "we had everything written in Haskell, including RCS, visualizer, etc" ?
11:15:01 <wli> Heffalump: spiffy
11:15:07 <Heffalump> lightstep: yep.
11:15:11 <Heffalump> we used darcs
11:15:21 <wli> Heffalump: URL to the solution?
11:15:30 * wli wants to take it for a spin.
11:15:38 <lightstep> you hax0red them
11:15:39 <Heffalump> http://urchin.earth.li/icfpcontest/2004/Introduction
11:16:24 * TFK takes notes on the competition >-)
11:17:06 <Oeje1> TFK: You just got to participate.
11:17:18 <Heffalump> I think he means that we're the competition.
11:17:35 <TFK> By "got" you mean "have" or "you were accepted"?
11:17:43 <TFK> Yes, I was being maniacally evil.
11:18:05 <Heffalump> "have"
11:18:25 <TFK> Oh, yes. I think I will :-)
11:18:25 <Oeje1> You need to.
11:18:29 <Heffalump> wli: if you have a good visualiser, run our ants against RedTeam or something.
11:18:40 <Heffalump> their traps make for good watching
11:18:59 <TFK> But is there really any chance for a single person?
11:19:06 * Heffalump suspects that the need to spend two weekends on it will rule out any realistic chance of getting our team together again :-(
11:19:11 <Heffalump> TFK: IMO, no
11:19:27 <Heffalump> but in 2003 a single person won it, so it's possible
11:19:46 <TFK> Maybe some super-genius ;-)
11:19:50 <Heffalump> but certainly none of the 4 of us would have won it in 2004 if we'd entered individually
11:20:37 <Oeje1> TFK: You can get at decent placing alone, if you work hard and get some good ideas.
11:21:23 <wli> Heffalump: How did you build it?
11:21:38 <wli> er
11:21:42 <wli> How do *I* build it?
11:21:43 <Oeje1> TFK: Four one person teams in top 25 in 04.
11:22:04 <Heffalump> wli: errm, can't remember.
11:22:07 <Heffalump> What have you tried?
11:22:16 <wli> I just found tools.txt
11:22:16 <TFK> Bah, Python only got 20-th/16-th place :-/
11:22:25 <TFK> All geniuses, I bet :-P
11:22:40 <roconnor> yay it works!
11:23:08 <wli> ghc-6.2.2: internal error: evacuate: strange closure type 46584
11:23:08 <wli>     Please report this as a bug to glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org,
11:23:08 <wli>     or http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ghc/
11:23:09 <TFK> Reminds me of a certain Adrian Kuegel who is the highest ranked at SPOJ
11:23:35 <TFK> You may find it good for practice :-)
11:23:37 <roconnor> but it reqires rank 2 polymorphism
11:23:48 <roconnor> ahhh rank 2 polymorphism.  How did we live without you
11:23:49 <wli> ghc-cvs it is
11:23:56 <Heffalump> wli: try a version of ghc that would have been released when the contest was on :-)
11:23:59 <Heffalump> e.g. 6.2.1 I think
11:24:16 <Oeje1> TFK: What is SPOJ?
11:24:21 <roconnor> sub :: forall a b. Term a -> (a -> Term b) -> Term b
11:24:22 <roconnor> sub (Var a) f = f a
11:24:24 <roconnor> sub (App t1 t2) f = App (sub t1 f) (sub t2 f)
11:24:26 <roconnor> sub (Lambda t) f = Lambda (sub t (thingy f))
11:24:28 <roconnor>   where
11:24:30 <roconnor>    thingy :: (a -> Term b) -> (Maybe a) -> Term (Maybe b)
11:24:31 <roconnor>    thingy f Nothing = Var Nothing
11:24:32 <roconnor>    thingy f (Just a) = sub (f a) (Var . Just)
11:24:39 <roconnor> there must be a nicer way of writing thingy
11:24:48 <TFK> http://spoj.sphere.pl/ <--- allows submissions from cool languages, like Python and Haskell :-)
11:25:37 <TFK> Also they have a competition thingie there, besides the usual judge system, but I don't participate (just solve the usual problems).
11:28:03 <wli> wxgtk is pushing my disk space to the limit
11:28:32 <Heffalump> you only need that for our visualiser
11:28:35 <musasabi> "schedule: re-entered unsafely." is starting to get annoying...
11:28:39 <Heffalump> and you really don't want our visualiser, it sucks big time
11:28:45 <Heffalump> get someone else's
11:28:47 <wli> I just want to see it
11:28:56 <musasabi> What is the preferred way to debug the rts?
11:29:01 <Heffalump> no, really, it's horrible. Slow and broken screen updates
11:29:15 <Heffalump> get our ant, run it with a decent tool :-)
11:29:16 <wli> I mean I want a picture of any kind
11:29:30 <Heffalump> well, if you insist..
11:29:36 <wli> I don't really care if the picture sucks.
11:29:50 <Lemmih> musasabi: You just have to use safe calls when using callbacks to haskell code.
11:30:02 <wli> unknokwn package wx
11:30:14 <musasabi> Lemmih: I have no callbacks to haskell code.
11:30:28 <wli> okay, I'm missing libs or something
11:30:36 <wli> Heffalump: alrighty, point me to a visualizer
11:30:47 <Heffalump> errm, I can't actually remember what's a good one
11:31:00 <Heffalump> now I think of it, the advantage of ours is that it understands what our trails mean
11:31:01 <musasabi> they seem to happen around a safe ffi call (but that is just a putStrLn style test).
11:31:10 <Lemmih> musasabi: Are you sure? I don't think that error will be displayed in any other event.
11:31:41 <musasabi> Lemmih: quite sure.
11:31:47 <roconnor> instance Monad Term where
11:31:50 <roconnor>   return = Var
11:31:52 <roconnor>   (>>=) = sub
11:32:20 <musasabi> Lemmih: no C code calling haskell and no foreign export anywhere.
11:32:58 <musasabi> Lemmih: also the error happens only if I have enough load and concurrency - not everytime executing the same piece of code.
11:34:06 <Lemmih> Only using safe calls may be an option.
11:34:08 <musasabi> I checked the emitted assembler code and it was callind suspendThread and resumeThread correctly too..
11:34:56 <musasabi> how could unsafe calls trigger that if they don't call into haskell land?
11:39:45 <vincenz> oh zell
11:39:47 <vincenz> oh well even
11:39:51 <vincenz> there goes my reason to learn ocaml
11:39:54 <vincenz> I mean haskell
11:40:09 <Oeje1> vincenz: Where did it go?
11:41:21 <vincenz> down the drain
11:41:28 <TFK> Why?
11:41:45 <Lemmih> musasabi: An unsafe call leaves the RTS unusable and then another Haskell thread gets executed?
11:42:38 <musasabi> Found a foreign import, that when switched to safe makes it emit <<loop>> and get stuck...
11:42:57 <musasabi> But I am sure that it is not calling haskell.
11:46:14 <musasabi> Lemmih: how would that be possible?
11:46:37 <Lemmih> I have no idea (:
11:47:46 <musasabi> The problem is that this seems quite hard to reduce to a simple testcase.
11:48:40 <Lemmih> Can I have a look at it?
11:51:35 <musasabi> yes, I'll make a tarball.
11:56:41 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/haskell-epoll.tar.gz, build.sh should be enough to build it (as cabal supports c_sources in executables only from today).
11:56:44 <Lemmih> vincenz: Why don't you wanna learn Haskell?
11:58:07 <musasabi> wait. that tarball needs fixing.
12:01:53 <musasabi> Lemmih: ok, now it should work.
12:03:53 <musasabi> Lemmih: run either of them (httpd_select should work everywhere) like ./httpd_select 8080, it is a dummy http daemon returning an empty page to all requests. Now use something like ab to kill it. (I use "/usr/sbin/ab2 -c 1000 -n 5000 127.0.0.1:8888/foo" - comes with apache, but anything else putting many concurrent requests should work)
12:10:26 <Lemmih> musasabi: Very weird indeed.
12:11:10 <musasabi> you succeeded in getting the error?
12:11:58 <Lemmih> Yes.
12:12:51 <Lemmih> Making all calls safe still fails.
12:13:01 <Lemmih> But at a later time.
12:13:11 <Lemmih> Hey SyntaxNinja.
12:13:54 <SyntaxNinja> hey!
12:15:08 <SyntaxNinja> is there no queue in base?
12:15:13 <musasabi> SyntaxNinja: thanks for the quick c-sources fix :-)
12:16:38 <SyntaxNinja> musasabi: np
12:18:20 <SyntaxNinja> looks like there _will_ be a Data.Queue, but there's not in 6.2?
12:18:55 <SyntaxNinja> musasabi: ooi, where are you getting cabal from?
12:23:22 <musasabi> SyntaxNinja: cvs, currently.
12:27:04 <ral1> Hello
12:27:08 <Lemmih> Hey
12:27:14 <ral1> Hi lemmih.
12:27:24 <ral1> I have a question about running hugs in windows.
12:28:10 <Lemmih> Okay.
12:28:37 <ral1> I am have installed hugs on windows for a friend and i have figured out how to load files, but it keeps saying undefined type constructor.   Even for simple types like Int or bool.
12:31:54 <Lemmih> Could be an incomplete installation, perhaps?
12:32:14 <Heffalump> what exactly are you trying to do?
12:33:47 <ral1> Lemmih: that's a good theory.  I can't think of anything else.  it must be an incomplete installation.
12:34:11 <ral1> I'm just trying to run a simple program.  Like square :: Int -> Int \n square n = n*n
12:34:41 <Heffalump> and you're using runhugs, or hugs?
12:35:05 <Heffalump> oh, you have that program in a file and are loading it with hugs?
12:35:14 <Heffalump> wi ral1
12:35:18 <Heffalump> bah, sorry
12:35:19 <ral1> hugs.  Yes.  I am loading it.
12:35:36 <Heffalump> hugs should tell you where it's loading the Prelude from
12:35:44 <Heffalump> does it tell you, and does that file actually exist?
12:36:55 <ral1> man.  This is awkward.  I'm not used to using windows.
12:41:38 <ral1> Yeah, There' s a Prelude.hs in C:\Program Files\Hugs98\libraries.  that's where it seems to be loading from.
12:47:28 <Heffalump> if you just run hugs without a file, does it work
12:47:36 <Heffalump> e.g. does :t 5 give you the right thing, etc
12:57:06 <ral1> Heffalump:  Yeah, it seems to.
12:58:00 <ral1> prelude functions seem to have the right type.  take 3 [1..10] gives the expected answer
12:59:19 <Heffalump> that's just odd, then.
12:59:28 <Heffalump> what's the precise error when you try to load your file?
13:00:49 <araujo> anybody has tested the latest stable release of ghc?
13:01:28 <TheHunter> sure.
13:01:32 <TheHunter> seems to work great.
13:01:50 <Heffalump> is 6.4 out?
13:02:02 <TheHunter> only release candidates.
13:19:14 <syntax_syntax> how would you define an "Operating System" in lay terms for an academic thesis in the business/economics field?
13:19:22 <syntax_syntax> I'm trying to go around "Software component that performs the communication between the higher-level applications and the underlying hardware", but that is plagued with problems.
13:19:36 <syntax_syntax> Beginning with "level", and the fact that OSes actually communicate with software that's in the hardware -- er, firmware.
13:20:07 <syntax_syntax> I'm trying to be strict about the engineering involved because I'm going about the strategic options faced by the computer industry when building platforms.
13:32:24 <monochrom> You will need to be broad about the meaning of "operating system".  For example there was Windows 3.1 and there were people saying "win 3.1 is not an operating *system*, it is an operating *environment*".  I think such nitpicking is irrelevant to business/economics.
13:35:13 <monochrom> Here is a very short but versatile and robust definition.  A hardcore computer systems person accepts it.  But at the same time it also makes business sense.  An operating system manages the resources of the computer and assigns them to applications.
13:37:37 <monochrom> It is robust because technologies can change but the need for arbitrating resources to applications remains.  It is also at home with the economists because they know all too well the need of an arbitration infrastructure or framework in any large system.
13:37:53 <monochrom> s/the need of/the need for/
13:38:36 <musasabi> Lemmih: I was able to reproduce the error without any ffi on my part, so I'll bug ghc-users.
13:38:59 <Lemmih> Neat.
13:46:06 * CosmicRay can't figure out how the HTTP module ever worked for people
13:46:22 <CosmicRay> it expects recv to return [] when the remote end is closed, but it raises an exception
13:48:44 <wli> hmm, how do I parse unicode input in haskell?
13:49:06 <wli> (or any other programming language to be honest)
13:52:04 <tuomov> utf-8?
13:52:16 <monochrom> Java does it automatically.  utf-8.
13:52:33 <CosmicRay> what do you mean, parse it?
13:52:37 <monochrom> Does GHC.Unicode have something useful?
13:52:52 <CosmicRay> a String in Haskell is composed of 32-bit chars, I believe
13:52:56 <CosmicRay> wide enough for unicode
13:52:59 <CosmicRay> there should be no problem
13:53:25 <monochrom> Yes but if an input stream is in utf-8 format, some minimal processing is necessary.
13:53:35 <wli> CosmicRay: yes, just parse input (not in Haskell, not accepted by a preexisting compiler -- not even a programming language) in Unicode
13:53:52 <CosmicRay> monochrom: true
13:54:26 <CosmicRay> wli: well I don't see where the problem is.  Is your input utf-8 then, and you need a codec?
13:54:38 <wli> CosmicRay: seems like it
13:54:44 <CosmicRay> ah ok.
13:54:51 <wli> CosmicRay: plus a lexical analyzer / parser generator that can handle it
13:54:54 <syntax_syntax> yay. they found the largest mersenne prime again.
13:54:55 <CosmicRay> now I got it.
13:54:58 <tuomov> in C the proper thing to do would be to use mbsrtowcs
13:55:02 <tuomov> but utf-8 is very easy to parse
13:55:04 <CosmicRay> wli: however, I don't know what the answer is
13:55:11 <CosmicRay> wli: I'd suggest asking on haskell-cafe
13:55:21 <CosmicRay> or try http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/i18n.html
13:55:35 <wli> tuomov: thanks, that will do
13:55:53 <tuomov> mbsrtowcs of course requires the locale to be utf-8
13:56:03 <tuomov> iconv is another alternative, but the encoding names are not standard
13:56:07 <CosmicRay> http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/haskell/Unicode.hs
13:56:25 <wli> CosmicRay: that looks like unicode output but not input
13:56:27 <tuomov> there's some haskell utf8 code in ginsu (or riot, ripped from the former)
13:56:47 <wli> tuomov: you say that the coding/decoding is easy?
13:56:57 <tuomov> yes, utf8 is a wonderful encoding
13:57:01 <CosmicRay> wli: ucs4ToStr . utf8ToUcs4
13:57:17 <wli> CosmicRay: where are those?
13:57:26 <CosmicRay> wli: http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/haskell/Unicode.hs
13:57:48 <wli> CosmicRay: okay, I found it; I had to follow one more hyperlink
13:58:04 <tuomov> it looks a bit more complicated in haskell than it really is..
14:00:14 <monochrom> oops, GHC.Unicode simply does classification of characters as "letters", "numbers", ...
14:00:22 <Heffalump> is there any Haskell to do unicode (any encoding) to and from ISO-8859-1 ?
14:01:01 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: I don't believe I've seen that kind of codec prepackaged for haskell
14:01:10 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: however you could do that trivially through a C or Python binding
14:01:17 <CosmicRay> especially trivially through a Python binding
14:01:31 <wli> My FFI-fu is near-nil
14:01:42 <CosmicRay> wli: how's your Python-fu?
14:01:59 <wli> CosmicRay: probably okay but I don't actually like python
14:02:18 <CosmicRay> doesn't matter.  you only have to like its codecs module :-)
14:02:22 <CosmicRay> http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-codecs.html
14:02:46 <CosmicRay> MissingPy can handle Python file-like objects that this module uses
14:02:58 <CosmicRay> it can also call arbitrary Python functions or methods
14:03:01 <CosmicRay> and instantiate Python objects
14:03:04 <CosmicRay> no FFI required
14:03:06 <CosmicRay> it's all done for you
14:03:22 <CosmicRay> it can also call the Python interpreter to execute bits of code
14:03:25 <CosmicRay> or evaluate them
14:05:09 <jlouis> Heffalump: I read up on the fixpoint theorem yesterday: Either you need a function f: D -> D which is monotone and continuous on a cpo D, or you need a lattice D and a monotone f: D -> D (in which case it is the Knaster-Tarski theorem)
14:05:10 <Heffalump> I was hoping for a native one so I didn't have to use the python operations :-)
14:05:21 <CosmicRay> wli: following may be of interest in that module: latin_1_encode, latin_1_decode, utf_8_decode, utf_8_encode
14:05:40 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: if all you need to do is process unicode, native ones exist
14:05:43 <wli> jlouis: Are you sure a semilattice won't do?
14:05:51 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: I just don't think that there's anything in haskell to convert between different charsets
14:06:01 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: not that it would be all that difficult to write one
14:06:04 <CosmicRay> it would just take some time
14:06:10 <Heffalump> I want to embed ISO-8859-1 (and ideally arbitary charsets) in Unicode and then unembed.
14:06:17 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: btw, did you see my message on cafe about http?
14:06:23 <Heffalump> oh, no
14:06:25 * Heffalump goes to loo
14:06:27 <Heffalump> k
14:06:32 <jlouis> wli: define a semilattice compared to a lattice. The book I read did not introduce them, but it does not use the whole potential of lattices
14:06:48 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: it seems to assume that recv returns [] when the remote socket is closed, but actually recv raises an eof error
14:06:57 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: did you package bjorn's one (from xml-rpc)?
14:07:02 <Heffalump> has it made it into the Debian archive yet?
14:07:05 <SyntaxNinja> hiya
14:07:07 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: not afaik
14:07:10 <Heffalump> he makes it available in a separate darcs repo, but yes
14:07:12 <wli> jlouis: a semilattice is one where only meets or joins are required to exist (a meet semilattice has all meets, a join semilattice has all joins).
14:07:32 <wli> jlouis: my wild guess is that you don't actually need T
14:07:32 <jlouis> wli: never heard the terms meet and joins, sorry
14:08:15 <wli> jlouis: eh? how the heck do you define a lattice without meet and join? What do they call the /\ and \/ operators, then?
14:08:30 <Heffalump> I'll clean up your patch a bit and apply it, ta (and forward it upstream)
14:08:31 * Igloo isn't clear, but new packages might not be processed pre-sarge
14:09:15 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: right, OK
14:09:19 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: the patch is against that one
14:09:25 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: what I don't understand is why nobody noticed this sooner
14:09:33 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: because it bit me 100% of the time
14:10:03 <jlouis> wli: they do not define it algebraically it seems. They just take a poset, in which case meet and join would be the inf and sup
14:10:15 <jlouis> they still call it a lattice though
14:10:31 <jlouis> (this was what I could get out of mathworld quickly)
14:10:33 <Heffalump> might depend on the library version
14:10:41 <CosmicRay> hmm
14:10:48 <Heffalump> what version of ghc are you using?
14:11:02 <CosmicRay> you think they would have made such a major change in fptools?
14:11:02 <CosmicRay> 6.2.2
14:11:04 <wli> jlouis: In this case I believe you don't need all sups to exist.
14:11:05 <CosmicRay> the version in sid
14:11:10 <Heffalump> well, so am I
14:11:15 <Heffalump> but I may never have tested with error documents.
14:11:18 <CosmicRay> and it worked for you?
14:11:18 <Heffalump> I'll play a bit
14:11:32 <CosmicRay> this happens to me even with successful transfers
14:11:50 <Heffalump> hmm.
14:12:03 <CosmicRay> I wonder if it might possibly have something to do with server content that is dynamically generated, has no content-length header, and is connection: close.
14:12:06 <Heffalump> will you be around in 30 mins or so? I need to go do something.
14:12:17 <CosmicRay> yes, but not in 45 mins
14:12:34 <Heffalump> well, it can wait  Iguess.
14:12:42 <Heffalump> I'll try to repro your problem.
14:12:43 <CosmicRay> feel free to email me
14:12:46 <CosmicRay> super
14:13:14 <wli> jlouis: though you may not need sups, you may need other things like the ascending chain condition.
14:13:16 <Heffalump> though if you can point me at a URL that does what you describe that'd save me some effort :-)
14:13:35 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: the server I've been testing on is behind a firewall, unfortunately
14:13:42 <CosmicRay> two firewalls, even
14:13:47 <wli> jlouis: (well, not literally that, since it's trivially violated by anything with _|_, but you get the idea)
14:13:49 <Heffalump> would it be easy for me to reproduce its setup?
14:14:06 <CosmicRay> it's some sort of apache soap deal running under tomcat
14:14:08 <CosmicRay> so likely no :-)
14:14:10 <Heffalump> oh, ugh
14:14:20 <Heffalump> I'll try to figure out another way to cause connection: close
14:14:38 <CosmicRay> I think simpleHTTP will cause that every time
14:14:54 <CosmicRay> I am using POST btw
14:14:58 <Heffalump> as in 1.0?
14:15:02 <Heffalump> or just using POST at all?
14:15:03 <CosmicRay> no
14:15:08 <jlouis> wli: I think so
14:15:09 <CosmicRay> as in simpleHTTP, the function
14:15:12 <CosmicRay> this is still HTTP/1.1
14:15:18 <Heffalump> oh, right
14:15:19 <jlouis> ok, ispell(1), here I come
14:22:42 <CosmicRay> Thanks to Mr. Gates, we now know that an open Internet with protocols anyone can implement is communism; it was set up by that famous communist agent, the U.S. Department of Defense.

14:26:32 * boegel greets #haskell
14:26:43 <bourbaki> greets boegel :)
14:26:47 <jlouis> 'lo boegel
14:27:11 <bourbaki> boegel: you still need to extend your renderer someday with some parameterized surfaces
14:27:25 <boegel> bourbaki: I don't have time now, I'm afraid :)
14:27:33 <bourbaki> not now someday
14:27:49 <bourbaki> i would love to build a displacement mapping thing for it
14:27:50 <boegel> I'm writing my article for TMR, try to keep up with classes, and have to do some serious work on my thesis
14:27:55 <bourbaki> im working on that atm
14:28:12 <boegel> bourbaki: the code will be available in July, probably
14:28:24 <boegel> you can hack/improve it all you want then :)
14:28:26 <bourbaki> but you wont extend it for fun?
14:28:35 <boegel> bourbaki: I don't know yet, I might
14:29:00 <bourbaki> if so let me know so that you could extend it with my objects
14:29:09 <wli> ooh, renderers and objects
14:29:12 <boegel> but I shouldn't extend it know, I should make sure my code has good structure, is documented with Haddoc, and I should do some theory about it too
14:29:25 <wli> I've been farting around looking at object modelling.
14:29:25 <boegel> bourbaki: ok, I will
14:29:25 <bourbaki> the idea is that you dont only map into the objects space with position but also tangentspace and normal
14:29:37 <wli> Inspired by the PlayStation 2 I got for my wife.
14:29:56 <wli> (doing mostly reading atm.)
14:30:04 <bourbaki> reading what?
14:30:07 <boegel> bourbaki: I'm not sure what you'e talking about, but I think you do :)
14:30:14 <wli> bourbaki: googling for relevant stuff
14:30:20 <wli> bourbaki: (I hope, anyway)
14:30:22 <bourbaki> boegel: yes i am somewhat as always :)
14:30:48 <wli> bourbaki: I've noticed a number of odd things games don't draw and I'm trying to figure out why they don't and how they could
14:31:00 <boegel> does anyone know if Monday is a hard deadline for TMR?
14:31:03 <bourbaki> what games?
14:31:03 <wli> bourbaki: mostly in the area of the physics/modelling/etc.
14:31:09 <boegel> 'cause I'm afraid I won't make that deadline :s
14:31:27 <wli> bourbaki: PlayStation 2 games (I figure it doesn't matter which one, but maybe it does -- I'm trying to find out more)
14:31:29 <bourbaki> hm sounds interesting what errors what that be?
14:31:44 <bourbaki> ah so you happen to be one of these ps2 hackers :)?
14:31:53 <wli> bourbaki: No hacking, just reading.
14:32:27 <wli> I figure there is a buttload of something going into this stuff so I should be vaguely aware of what's going on.
14:32:33 <bourbaki> hacking as in getting to know anything about it
14:32:57 <bourbaki> i think one prob with the ps2 is that you need to do a lot of stuff from scratch
14:32:57 <wli> bourbaki: Well, I don't have the PS2 in particular in mind, just how it works and why it does and doesn't do various things.
14:33:11 <bourbaki> in all games?
14:33:21 <bourbaki> does do and doesnt do stuff compared to what?
14:33:23 <wli> bourbaki: My knowledge level is very low.
14:33:40 <wli> bourbaki: Well, for instance, I notice I can't change clothes, or break things in half, etc.
14:33:49 <bourbaki> ah
14:33:56 <bourbaki> well there are some issues with that
14:34:10 <bourbaki> there are articles around on the net on fraction
14:34:29 <bourbaki> there is also red faction on the ps2 which has this level edformation thingy
14:34:38 <wli> bourbaki: Or throw phones at people, or wear wreaths as necklaces.
14:34:53 <bourbaki> changeing clothes isnt much of a prob but there is little memory to store textures in
14:35:13 <bourbaki> so what you want is more realism?
14:35:25 <bourbaki> towards more physics better ai and such?
14:35:51 <wli> bourbaki: Mostly I notice the physics things, mostly in/around parts I think qualify as modelling.
14:36:18 <bourbaki> they often use convex hulls
14:36:19 <wli> bourbaki: Basically objects get stuck with "fixed" purposes, and you can't use them in other than the intended way, etc.
14:36:30 <bourbaki> to speed up the physics or primitive bodies
14:37:13 <bourbaki> so you basically want more freedom in games ?
14:37:33 <wli> bourbaki: I suppose yes.
14:37:56 <bourbaki> the pitty is that all games that come to my mind which tried that were flops
14:38:06 <bourbaki> black and white and republica
14:38:30 <wli> bourbaki: I don't have a particularly well-summarized notion behind all this (or even really a single underlying motive), I just see the stuff and go "hmm".
14:38:42 <wli> s/single/coherent/
14:39:02 <bourbaki> do you know the game creatures?
14:39:06 <bourbaki> from creature labs
14:39:18 <wli> bourbaki: Those don't sound very googlable (i.e. I expect numerous false hits); do you have URL's about them?
14:39:25 <wli> bourbaki: No, I don't actually.
14:39:28 <bourbaki> sec
14:39:31 <bourbaki> let me search it
14:40:06 <bourbaki> http://www.gamewaredevelopment.co.uk/creatures_index.php
14:40:23 <bourbaki> you can breed small creatures and from what i know you also can script new toys for them
14:40:33 <bourbaki> so you can teach them ball playing and such
14:40:57 * boegel tries to continue writing his TMR article
14:41:01 <bourbaki> i have heared that they trained some of the norns to dog fight against jet piolots and they did well
14:41:24 <wli> bourbaki: is the proliferation of objects under subdivision or otherwise trying to figure out how things react to various "unexpected" uses a hard problem?
14:42:09 <bourbaki> wli: can you rephrase that question?
14:42:09 <wli> s/a hard problem/hard problems/
14:42:42 <wli> bourbaki: I would expect objects proliferating when you e.g. break them in half repeatedly would cause a problem with memory consumption and/or slowdown of O(objects) algorithms.
14:43:28 <bourbaki> ah
14:43:59 <wli> bourbaki: I would also expect that getting all objects to react to the players' control when the control does something "unexpected" to them to be somehow difficult (e.g. if you have to talk into a phone, you may need to reuse the "throw" button for dialing purposes/etc.).
14:44:15 <bourbaki> yeah but the physics systems are really fast now adays i think that you could implement something that is really quick if i remember right the man who wrote the papers was named obrian
14:45:32 <wli> bourbaki: So the proliferation of objects isn't a problem for the physics engines. Is it a problem for the rendering engines (e.g. raytracers might have trouble figuring out which object rays bounce off of quickly when large numbers of objects are about)?
14:46:14 <bourbaki> if you wanted to do raytraceing yes
14:46:24 <wli> bourbaki: What do things do instead?
14:46:26 <bourbaki> but the render engines dont ray cast alot
14:46:39 <bourbaki> first its a game design problem
14:46:56 <bourbaki> second of course the more is destroyable the more you will run into a mem problem
14:47:17 <bourbaki> and cpu power also so im not talking about atom level physics sim or such ;)
14:47:33 <bourbaki> half life 2 is a good example i think
14:47:37 <wli> bourbaki: Can you give me handwavy guesstimates about the growth of memory and/or cpu consumption with more objects/etc.?
14:47:48 <bourbaki> it has a physics engine that can be used for the actual game
14:48:13 <bourbaki> no but you could have a look at the freeware physics engine
14:48:15 <bourbaki> s
14:52:03 <boegel> if 'suffice' correct in English ? as in 'that's enough to do something'
14:52:07 <boegel> s/if/is
14:52:10 <wli> bourbaki: What are the problems associated with "unintended" uses of objects, like e.g. throwing phones, wearing odd objects, stacking things to build bridges, etc.?
14:52:54 <wli> boegel: Q: "how much will I need to buy a receiver?" A: "40 dollars will suffice"
14:53:20 <wli> boegel: so "be enough" maybe
14:53:44 <boegel> wli: "once everything is installed, it should suffice to use "import blehbleh" '
14:53:56 <wli> boegel: Perfectly correct.
14:54:02 <boegel> wli:Thanks :)
14:54:04 <bourbaki> wli: that will be a challenge for the game designer
14:54:20 <bourbaki> wli: do you know trespasser this old game based on jurasic park?
14:54:23 <wli> bourbaki: Okay, first which "field" does this fall into?
14:54:25 <boegel> I have some doubts on my English sometimes, but this way I'll learn to write correct English (I hope)
14:54:39 <wli> bourbaki: I played video games for the first time in over 10 years earlier this week.
14:55:01 <wli> bourbaki: So I have no idea about video games (I never ever seriously played them).
14:55:03 <bourbaki> wli: a lot of game designers would tell you that total freedom would give them the creaps cause they cant control the situation anymore same applies for ai
14:55:27 <bourbaki> thats quite cool :)
14:55:31 <wli> bourbaki: The players or the game players?
14:55:45 <wli> bourbaki: Would it be the players or the game designers who get the creeps?
14:55:55 <bourbaki> the game designers
14:56:08 <bourbaki> cause its hard to get you to do what you should to
14:56:09 <wli> bourbaki: Are there actual technical obstacles to do this?
14:56:10 <bourbaki> er do
14:56:21 <wli> bourbaki: Are there actual technical obstacles to doing this?
14:56:33 <bourbaki> some yes physically simulation wise of course
14:56:50 <bourbaki> but i would say it strongly depends on the scale
14:56:54 <wli> bourbaki: I'd be interested in finding out about those. How much of this would you say is doable with existing stuff?
14:56:58 <bourbaki> that is how big is the world
14:57:19 <bourbaki> try to get some videos of half life 2
14:57:24 <wli> bourbaki: oh, there's the other one; breaking fixed structures
14:57:26 <bourbaki> maybe theres a demo
14:57:44 <bourbaki> theres this game named red faction they had level destruction
14:57:51 <wli> bourbaki: like e.g. driving a car into a house's living room or driving a tank through a wall of a building
14:58:13 <bourbaki> and by the way personally i think that the best games are more then 10 years old
14:58:15 <bourbaki> or nearly that
14:58:34 <bourbaki> just because the games had a story and all that makes a far better game then physics and all
14:58:51 <wli> bourbaki: I never frequently played them; it was literally a couple of one-time affairs.
15:00:38 <bourbaki> if you like rpgs have a look at gothic]
15:01:26 <Oeje1> Hello, boegel.
15:01:48 <boegel> Oeje1: hey
15:02:14 <wli> bourbaki: I wouldn't say I like or dislike genres or whatever, I've only played something like 2 or 3 differentgames.
15:02:28 <Oeje1> boegel: Did you get my mail?
15:02:36 <wli> bourbaki: heck, I can't even name or recognize the genres
15:03:12 <bourbaki> wli: yeah :) i know what you mean anyway i think that games could allow more freedom but thats for a price
15:03:19 <boegel> Oeje1: eh...
15:03:39 <xerox> 'night folks
15:03:55 <bourbaki> i mean take games like the sims you can do so much with them but its totally boreing :)
15:04:00 <wli> bourbaki: Okay, what's the price? It seems to me that these things would be pretty beneficial.
15:04:24 <boegel> g'night xerox
15:04:36 <bourbaki> or morrowwind
15:05:04 <bourbaki> you need to have the right balance between freedom and story bound elements
15:05:45 <kosmikus> I'd recommend Ultima V or something ;)
15:05:46 <bourbaki> think about this you get a handgranade in level 1 and in level 20 there is a fence with loads of guards
15:06:14 <bourbaki> but you just blow up that fence and acomplish the mission in 2 seconds thats hard to get rid of game design wise
15:06:49 <Heffalump> @seen bringert
15:06:49 <lambdabot> I saw bringert leaving #haskell.se 14 hours 9 minutes 38 seconds ago.
15:08:05 <wli> bourbaki: I've been playing the Ghost in the Shell 2: Stand Alone Complex game this week (finished it this morning).
15:08:22 <bourbaki> dont know that one :)
15:09:17 <wli> bourbkai: I've been trying to get anime-themed video games for my wife, and she parked me on the things to get her levels up or something.
15:09:40 <bourbaki> :)
15:10:14 <wli> bourbaki: My response was, "Well, I don't really play games, but if you insist." and it appears I'm vaguely good at the things or something.
15:10:16 <bourbaki> im not into playing games too much so :)
15:10:26 <bourbaki> haha cool
15:10:38 <bourbaki> that reminds me of some old sitcom
15:11:07 <wli> So I got called upon to basically go through the whole game, at which point it's questionable that my wife is actually playing with my assistance as opposed to just watching me play.
15:11:18 <bourbaki> where they tried to achive something in a video game went away and let the sceptig guy play the game for a while and then they wont get the back back ever
15:11:48 <bourbaki> i love to watch other ppl play :)
15:12:06 <wli> I'm generally aggravated and frustrated by the things and spend more time pondering the holes in the physics, AI, or graphics than whatever.
15:12:49 <bourbaki> that if you dont see the game as a game but something technical
15:13:05 <wli> bourbaki: I heard there are issues with rendering numerous objects, e.g. the Gungrave video game is supposed to "slow down" when there are "large" numbers of opponents.
15:13:18 <bourbaki> what i have seen in game over the last years is that they tend to have less story then in the beginning
15:13:45 <bourbaki> that can have a lot of different reasons
15:13:52 <wli> bourbaki: What's "the beginning"? The beginning of video game stuff or the beginning of a game has more story than the end of the same game?
15:13:57 <bourbaki> for one fillrates of the gfx boards is bad
15:14:10 <bourbaki> beginning like monkey island and such
15:14:20 <wli> I don't know what monkey island is.
15:14:23 <bourbaki> that were really cool games cool story lot of fun
15:14:33 <bourbaki> do you have linux?
15:15:07 <wli> I'm 100% Linux at home except for one MacOS X box.
15:15:17 <bourbaki> debian?
15:15:22 <wli> yeah
15:15:31 <bourbaki> apt-get install scumvm :)
15:15:47 <wli> bourbaki: What is it?
15:15:48 <bourbaki> thats the emulator for these old games most of them are abandonware already
15:16:21 <bourbaki> day of the tentacle is also a cool game
15:17:15 <wli> oh, I probably won't actually want to play too many more games (RSI is showstopping, so apart from hanging out with the wifey I don't bother)
15:17:34 <Heffalump> is the name of a .cabal file case-sensitive?
15:17:43 <bourbaki> rsi so sucks
15:18:01 <Heffalump> wli: what do you mean by showstopping?
15:18:40 <wli> Heffalump: after a while it gets really hard to control anything well or accurately and it gets painful too
15:18:50 <Heffalump> how long have you had it?
15:18:54 <wli> a couple of hours basically
15:19:09 <Heffalump> no, I meant how long have you been getting those symptoms for
15:19:11 <wli> Heffalump: RSI? Not sure.
15:19:15 <Heffalump> right
15:19:22 <boegel> does anyone know some big Haskell GUI libs besides gtk2hs and wxHaskell
15:19:31 <Heffalump> (I started getting them in June or so, and I'm not sure how scared to be by it)
15:19:39 <wli> Heffalump: I presumed it was an inevitable consequence of typing a lot and just lived with it.
15:20:13 <bourbaki> you just need a propper working place thats all
15:20:19 <wli> Heffalump: it's been many years, over five and probably less than 10
15:20:36 <Heffalump> has it got progressively worse?
15:20:56 <wli> bourbaki: the kind of hours I pull at the terminal would probably nullify any of that.
15:21:01 <wli> Heffalump: yes
15:21:22 <bourbaki> wli: not sure about that
15:21:38 <wli> Well, I'm a remotee.
15:21:39 <bourbaki> if you are on a machine that long you also should buy some other input divice
15:23:14 <bourbaki> like this
15:23:14 <bourbaki> http://www.datahand.com/
15:25:13 <wli> bourbaki: there are probably better methods, e.g. using a table instead of a mouse, using one of the pit+glove -style "keyboards", etc.
15:25:27 <wli> not sure what the real name fo those is
15:25:43 <wli> basically you stick your hand in and make typing motions instead of having something you strike
15:27:06 <bourbaki> the best thing is to hand write all your stugg
15:27:08 <bourbaki> stuff
15:27:14 <wli> bourbaki: tablet?
15:27:29 <bourbaki> no just real paper and pen
15:27:47 <wli> I've heard tablets instead of mice are supposed to be good.
15:27:48 <bourbaki> it wont help you chatting but for storeing ideas thats just fine
15:28:10 <wli> I do a fair amount of that actually.
15:28:10 <bourbaki> according do rsi on wikipedia the best thing you can do is just use a keyboard
15:28:20 <bourbaki> useing the mouse is bad
15:28:30 <bourbaki> i have a much stronger right shoulder due to that
15:29:29 <wli> bourbaki: Michelle says that I have an unusual amount of strength for a guy that just sits around all the time.
15:29:42 <bourbaki> :)
15:30:01 <wli> bourbaki: Anyway, are there any games doing the things I/we have been going on about for the PlayStation 2? I don't have an xbox for Half Life 2.
15:30:20 <bourbaki> hm not that i know of
15:30:20 <wli> or a PC with the right OS either
15:30:33 <bourbaki> oh
15:30:41 <bourbaki> there is a game you might like there is a demo
15:30:45 <bourbaki> its named mindrover
15:30:49 <bourbaki> www.mindrover.com
15:30:59 <bourbaki> its a puzzle/ai game
15:31:08 <bourbaki> you have to build robots that do challenges
15:31:16 <bourbaki> or battle each other
15:33:55 <wli> bourbaki: Are there technical resources or about doing some of these things or technical names for them?
15:34:37 <bourbaki> google for open dynamics engine or newton physics engine
15:34:54 <wli> bourbaki: I've already downloaded ODE and looked at it. =)
15:34:58 <bourbaki> that are open source implementations of physics engine
15:35:00 <bourbaki> s
15:35:26 <bourbaki> the thing is the ps2 has only 8mb mem
15:35:36 <wli> bourbaki: holy crap
15:35:41 <bourbaki> so phyics is more or less a thing you dont want to run there
15:35:47 <bourbaki> you can swap mem and usch
15:35:53 <wli> bourbaki: no wonder these things cut out all the physics
15:35:57 <bourbaki> such thats really quick
15:36:05 <wli> bourbaki: and don't do object-splitting
15:36:22 <bourbaki> maybe it was 16 but its quite not enough :)
15:36:50 <bourbaki> this mem is really fast though but you have to fill all the units from that memory
15:36:54 <wli> bourbaki: would you say part of the reason why these things aren't done is that some of the major platforms they have to run on are too limited wrt. hardware to do them but things like e.g. ordinary PC's can run them?
15:37:25 <bourbaki> i think its developing time and that its not makeing the game better yet
15:37:56 <wli> wow
15:38:35 <wli> bourbaki: It's definitely cool that these things can already be done; I'd love to see a game that made use of them.
15:39:00 <bourbaki> dont expect too much
15:39:23 <bourbaki> the thing is no major game will ever do that i think
15:39:33 <wli> bourbaki: because it's hard to do the game/story/etc. design properly to tolerate "unexpected behavior"?
15:39:37 <bourbaki> because you cant deliver a stroy in such a game
15:39:42 <bourbaki> right
15:40:01 <bourbaki> see when you make a movie you can always use that hitchkock effect
15:40:14 <bourbaki> you see the danger the character in the movie does not
15:40:31 <wli> bourbaki: dramatic irony
15:40:44 <bourbaki> the thing is you cant change the situation
15:41:05 <bourbaki> in a computer game you always think that its possible to get out of the situation
15:41:27 <bourbaki> so its hard to tell a story that has some interesting situations
15:41:43 <bourbaki> and it even gets harder if you can freely pick your char and all
15:41:53 <bourbaki> there would be no cut scenes for example
15:42:36 <wli> bourbaki: the outcome would be less predictable, then?
15:42:55 <bourbaki> right
15:43:16 <bourbaki> maybe you can solve all the game in 5mins because the game designers didnt think about something
15:43:20 <bourbaki> like bomberman
15:43:54 <bourbaki> in the original japanese game there was a fireshield and then you where able to lay bombs and constantly blast anything away
15:44:15 <bourbaki> without beeing killed so i was able to do all the levels in like 10 minitues or so
15:44:25 <bourbaki> and thats quite a simple game already
15:45:33 <wli> bourbaki: I don't have a good answer to that.
15:45:58 <bourbaki> all i want to show you is how hard it will get to make that game balanced and fun
15:46:51 <bourbaki> and it might get boreing i mean in the end it gets sim life but you dont want to sim your life you want to get some entertainment :)
15:48:58 <bourbaki> i like puzzle and adventure games best and this genre is as good as dead
15:49:52 <wli> bourbaki: I have Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, which appears to be vaguely free-form, or at least a fair amount of the amusement derives from doing random crap instead of going after some goal.
15:50:12 <bourbaki> you are right a great example
15:50:38 <bourbaki> but do you think that the feature of throwing cell phones at the ppl would make it a better game?
15:51:10 <wli> bourbaki: I was thinking of landline-based phones but you get the idea.
15:51:42 <bourbaki> if it was an online game that was cool like skype or radio com
15:51:43 <wli> bourbaki: Well, there are other things, e.g. nunchuking a hair dryer and electric razor tied together by power cords etc.
15:52:16 <bourbaki> yeah i see what you are getting to but the problem is that it would be nice to have that but it wont ever make the game better
15:52:16 <wli> bourbaki: "improvised weapons"
15:52:21 <bourbaki> hell of a lot dev time
15:52:34 <bourbaki> oh you could so that to some extend at least
15:53:09 <bourbaki> a project i am going to work on soon will be charater generation
15:53:18 <wli> bourbaki: What does that entail?
15:53:34 <bourbaki> i think what is needed in a good game is that you need to make a good character that looks like you want
15:53:40 <wli> bourbaki: Also, why does what I described add so much to dev time? What's the "hard part" about it?
15:53:48 <bourbaki> if he is strong the model is strong as well and such
15:54:14 <bourbaki> the problem is that publishers arent intersted in good games but sure money
15:54:20 <bourbaki> they dont want to dare anything
15:54:32 <bourbaki> they want to make quick goodselling sequals
15:54:55 <bourbaki> and since all projects which tried to go in this direction failed it will take a lot of time
15:54:57 <bourbaki> but!
15:55:09 <bourbaki> have a look at the new lionhead game "the movies"
15:55:22 <bourbaki> theres a website that will be a game you will 100% likes
15:55:27 <bourbaki> -s
15:56:00 <wli> bourbaki: Well, I'm more concerned about why obvious ideas like clubbing people with rifles etc. etc. etc. aren't being done mostly on a technical level (who knows; maybe there are no technical obstacles at all?)
15:56:20 <wli> bourbaki: Where's the website? That doesn't sound googlable either.
15:56:24 <bourbaki> sec
15:56:47 <bourbaki> http://www.themoviesgame.com/
15:56:57 <bourbaki> in that game you can make your own movies
15:56:57 <wli> thanks
15:57:04 <bourbaki> i had this idea once also
15:57:21 <bourbaki> when and i have been there so i already had the impression that they scanned my brain ;)
15:57:43 <Oeje1> Talking about old PC games?
15:58:02 <bourbaki> no games that allow you a high degree of freedom
15:58:20 <bourbaki> i think one barrier there also lies within the not dynamicness of c++
15:58:23 <wli> Oeje1: not me, I'm mostly quizzing someone who actually does game-type stuff about why things I "expected" to be able to do in games were disallowed etc.
15:59:05 <Oeje1> Ah, ok.
15:59:05 <bourbaki> not disallowed just hard to do fun wise :) or timewise
15:59:18 <wli> bourbaki: I think we skipped over the time problem.
15:59:32 <wli> bourbaki: i.e. I don't understand why these things would take a lot of time.
15:59:45 <bourbaki> i mean you can do all possible animations to use all possible items as weapons
16:00:03 <wli> bourbaki: "all possible animations"?
16:00:08 <bourbaki> yes
16:00:31 <wli> bourbaki: I thought the surfaces etc. would be enough to deal with it on the fly?
16:00:32 <bourbaki> if you want a world of total freedom you would need an animation generating system
16:00:51 <wli> bourbaki: Okay, what are these animations you're referring to?
16:00:53 <bourbaki> maybe but there still might be queer situations
16:01:23 <bourbaki> i mean if he wants to pick up a 10 ton weight it will look different from lifting a water bottle
16:01:24 <bourbaki> ie
16:02:19 <wli> bourbaki: so the actions of picking things up, usig them as weapons, etc. are pre-generated and not generated from the ordinary surface models or something on that order?
16:02:24 <wli> bourbaki: Or are these the motions?
16:02:39 <bourbaki> yep thigs like that
16:02:58 <bourbaki> if you want freedom that way you need to get rid of predefined animations and all
16:03:16 <bourbaki> but what i thnk is feasable and also important is better looking characters
16:04:38 <wli> bourbaki: I anticipated that there would be problems with the controls because there's never a way to switch the controls around in different situations without ruling some action out, and there are no ways to define certain actions (e.g. twirling a coin between one's fingers) at all used in the ordinary control systems.
16:04:42 <bourbaki> i like rpgs and there this featrue is really important to me besides loads of statistics ;)
16:05:18 <bourbaki> yes the thing is if you want to be able to do this stuff on the fly
16:05:30 <bourbaki> like throwing the coin then you need to have a way to scipt it
16:05:41 <wli> bourbaki: What are the differences between types of games? I heard Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex was a "third-person shooter" when I thought it was a "first person shooter" etc.
16:05:42 <bourbaki> but wait theres something else that came to my mind sec
16:05:52 <wli> bourbaki: (webpages are probably best for that)
16:06:40 <bourbaki> dang
16:06:55 <bourbaki> there is a program that is named somethinglike virtual worlds or so
16:07:02 <bourbaki> ppl told me about that some time ago
16:07:19 <bourbaki> they also streamed a live concert of the stones into that thing
16:07:28 <bourbaki> you can scipt stuff on your own and import it
16:07:37 <bourbaki> a car for example a beer and so
16:08:16 <wli> bourbaki: so you can deal with it by switching into a "scripting mode" and then running the script?
16:08:36 <bourbaki> im not sure how that works in that implementation
16:08:56 <bourbaki> but i think you can do something without a barrier between the game and the script
16:09:15 * boegel goes to sleep
16:09:19 <boegel> g'night everyone
16:09:29 <bourbaki> http://codemages.sourceforge.net/codemages/cm.html
16:09:30 <bourbaki> bye
16:10:28 <bourbaki> have a look at the design paper on the site as well
16:11:00 <wli> bourbaki: looking
16:11:55 <wli> bourbaki: did we cover the development time point? I think we hit the control issue. Is the time issue centered around the animations also or something else?
16:12:32 <bourbaki> the time point was that you have to think about a lot of different cases and generate animations and models textures and the like
16:14:27 <bourbaki> i need to hit the sack
16:14:42 <bourbaki> try to search for some of these 3d chats
16:14:54 <bourbaki> there are some that allow you in game scripting afaik
16:15:10 <wli> bourbaki: thanks
16:15:20 <bourbaki> np was fun bye
16:32:48 <vincenz> Ok people
16:32:50 <vincenz> I need help
16:32:52 <vincenz> now
16:32:59 <vincenz> This is the time
16:33:01 <vincenz> I learn haskell
16:33:10 <vincenz> step 1) (usually what puts me off) an interpreter
16:35:41 <araujo> where shapr is when he is needed
16:38:36 * vincenz grins
16:41:49 <dons> I don't understand step 1.
16:42:01 <dons> have you got ghc installed?
16:43:32 <araujo> it shouldn't put you off
16:43:36 <araujo> emerge ghc
16:43:39 <araujo> done
16:43:42 <araujo> 8)
16:44:22 <vincenz> hmm
16:44:30 <vincenz> ghc is the one that allows you to define in top level?
16:44:49 <dons> ghc is a Haskell compiler, it also comes with ghci, an interpreter
16:45:24 <dons> it produces extremely fast object code
16:45:27 <vincenz> I know but some interpreters don't allow definition in toplevel
16:46:45 <vincenz> crap
16:46:49 <vincenz> no haskell package in my sys
16:47:23 <dons> ghci is just sits in a do-block, you enter top-level decls by loading a .hs file
16:47:42 <dons> vincenz: what system?
16:47:58 <vincenz> hugs good too?
16:48:00 <vincenz> mdk
16:48:47 <Lemmih> Mandrake uses RPM packages, right?
16:49:00 <vincenz> yip
16:50:42 <Lemmih> vincenz: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_622.html
16:51:36 <vincenz> rhx
16:51:38 <vincenz> thx even
16:54:35 <vincenz> hmm
16:54:36 <vincenz> odd
16:54:40 <vincenz> it installs but no ghci
16:55:14 <dons> what does ghc --interactive do?
16:55:58 <vincenz> no such executable
16:56:35 <Lemmih> No ghc?
16:56:35 <dons> where did it install to?
16:56:44 <dons> maybe you need to rehash your shell
16:56:49 <vincenz> mm
16:56:53 <vincenz> I did an updatedb and locate
16:56:56 <vincenz> no luck
16:57:08 <Lemmih> What package did you install?
16:57:22 <vincenz> the base one
16:57:22 <dons> ls /usr/local/bin/g* /usr/bin/g* ?
16:58:57 <vincenz> nada
16:59:25 <vincenz> aha
16:59:29 <vincenz> missing libreadline
17:00:54 <vincenz> it complains about it missing
17:00:56 <vincenz> but I have it installed
17:00:57 <vincenz> :/
17:01:28 <dons> maybe you need LDFLAGS=-L/my/readline/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/my/readline/include ?
17:01:35 <dons> export them in the shell
17:01:39 <Marios> hello,i have to write a design in haskell representing a stack (a pile of a adding and removing things- one of the functions is adding at the front and another is removing from the end of the stack). I know i can do this using lists but i would like to give it a go using abstract data types, do u think its a good idea or shall i just use lists? thanx
17:02:03 <vincenz> dons: for installing rpms?
17:02:05 <vincenz> doubtedly
17:02:13 <dons> oh, yeah. true.
17:02:20 <dons> you're not building src :}
17:03:01 <dons> Marios: either way would work fairly well. Though you'll probably just reimplement the list type if you define your own data type
17:03:21 <dons> maybe do it with lists, then try writing your own type
17:04:05 <Igloo> vincenz: Have you got the right versions?
17:04:10 <vincenz> Igloo: I got the latest
17:04:15 <Marios> k thanx
17:04:25 <Igloo> vincenz: It (ghc, probably not ghci) will probably work if you force it, anyway
17:04:50 <Igloo> vincenz: Just the latest may not be sufficient
17:04:59 <Igloo> The latest is presumably libreadline5, whereas you may need 4
17:05:13 <dons> ln -s ! ;)
17:05:18 <Igloo> Whatever it says should tell you, anyway
17:06:31 <SyntaxNinja> vincenz: hugs is perhaps simpler to install, fwiw. it's not as feature-full, and its just an interpreter
17:06:38 <vincenz> I got hugs already
17:09:59 <syntax_syntax> this is pretty off topic, but does anyone care to opine on this piece of music I did?
17:13:20 <shrimpx> gimme
17:16:21 <syntax_syntax> http://www.navarro.mus.br/diego/apres.mp3
17:17:12 <shrimpx> yay triple time
17:17:37 <syntax_syntax> it's kinda tacky, it's something I did after a break-up.
17:17:44 <syntax_syntax> I just bothered myself into recording it now
17:18:10 <shrimpx> hwo did you compose it? are the various tracks played in realtime or did you lay it out in software
17:18:20 <shrimpx> it's pretty cool btw
17:19:27 <syntax_syntax> played in real time.
17:19:31 <syntax_syntax> just three tracks there.
17:19:52 <syntax_syntax> and well, I composed it after getting really drunk over being dumped.
17:19:56 <syntax_syntax> http://www.navarro.mus.br/diego/gita.mp3
17:20:00 <syntax_syntax> there's some metal-ish music.
17:20:56 <shrimpx> 404
17:21:20 <syntax_syntax> oh
17:21:22 <syntax_syntax> http://www.navarro.mus.br/diego/gita.mp3.mp3
17:21:23 <syntax_syntax> there.
17:22:13 <shrimpx> hm you're good =)
17:22:26 <shrimpx> i need practice
17:22:59 <syntax_syntax> I'm actually totally out of practice with the guitar.
17:23:16 <syntax_syntax> I just recorded these two because my dad had the whole thing set up.
17:23:18 <dons> huh. for once typing "GHC" into google didn't give me ghc, instead "Guarded Horn Clauses"
17:23:35 <dons> "GHC is a concurrent logic programming language"
17:23:39 <syntax_syntax> He's in recording binge, tacky synth-led covers of tangos and suchlike. You know, stuff to make money.
17:24:51 <shrimpx> sweet
17:25:46 <syntax_syntax> The guitar piece was a one-shot thing, not pre-composed.
17:25:54 <syntax_syntax> Just laid down the chords and jammed over it.
17:26:04 <syntax_syntax> The waltz-y song I wrote when very sad.
17:40:59 <gzl> is anyone familiar with the Parser Monad?
17:42:55 <Heffalump> in Parsec?
17:43:15 * Heffalump is vaguely familiar with the general concept but isn't too sure of the details of the Parsec one
17:43:47 <gzl> something basically like this: http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/pearl.hs
17:43:55 <gzl> I don't know if that's parsec or not.
17:44:18 <Heffalump> it's not
17:44:25 <Heffalump> it's the exact one I was thinking of, in fact.
17:44:40 <gzl> oh, good.
17:45:01 <Heffalump> however, I was about to go to bed, so try to be quick :-)
17:45:10 <gzl> nuts. i'm still a little confused about how it works.
17:45:24 <Heffalump> how well do you understand monads?
17:45:34 <gzl> not well, yet. i'm trying.
17:45:53 <Heffalump> ok. It would probably help if you ignore the monad to start with.
17:46:03 <gzl> i understand the idea in principle but am still shaky on how to do stuff in practice.
17:46:12 <Heffalump> the basic idea of this style of writing parsers is that a parser is viewed as a non-deterministic consumer of input
17:46:31 <gzl> ok.
17:46:43 <Heffalump> given a string xs, a parser producing something of type foo will return a list of pairs of (foo,String)
17:46:58 <Heffalump> each String will be some suffix of the initial string xs
17:47:06 <gzl> right
17:47:14 <Heffalump> and the foo that goes with it will be what it managed to parse out of the prefix that was removed
17:47:24 <gzl> now, one thing I'm unsure of is how in general to parse the whole string in one shot
17:47:46 <Heffalump> in what sense? You want to fail if there isn't a way of parsing the string that consumes all the input?
17:48:27 <Heffalump> the point of that parser type is that it is used to build up complicated parsers from little parsers.
17:48:37 <gzl> right
17:48:38 <Heffalump> it's what's known as a combinator library
17:48:52 <gzl> ok, so for example, if you write parse item "hello"
17:48:53 <Heffalump> in common with many such libraries, to actually use it in the end you often want to do a little post-processing on the result
17:49:05 <gzl> it returns [('h', "ello")]
17:49:20 <gzl> so it's only parsed one character
17:49:24 <Heffalump> that's because you asked for a single character
17:49:27 <gzl> rihgt
17:49:56 <gzl> i'm not sure how to do that one-character parsing repeatedly
17:50:12 <Heffalump> did you use the 'item' parser to get the above result?
17:50:50 <Heffalump> and do you know what "do" notation is and how to use it (doesn't matter if you don't, I'll just explain it differently)
17:50:58 <gzl> yeah, I know what do notation is
17:51:02 <gzl> yes, I used item
17:51:07 <Heffalump> ok. So one way you could parse two characters is
17:51:11 <Heffalump> do c1 <- item
17:51:13 <Heffalump>    c2 <- item
17:51:17 <Heffalump>    return (c1,c2)
17:51:32 <Heffalump> that'll give you [(('h','e'),"llo")]
17:51:34 <gzl> right, but what about for an arbitrary string?
17:51:51 <Heffalump> use some recursion :-)
17:51:59 <Heffalump> do c <- item
17:52:06 <Heffalump> sorry
17:52:12 <Heffalump> foo = do c <- item
17:52:16 <Heffalump>           cs <- foo
17:52:20 <Heffalump> except lining up properly
17:52:27 <Heffalump>        return (c:cs)
17:52:34 <Heffalump> line that up properly too... :-)
17:53:02 <Heffalump> that's a sort of general idea, but it won't work because it doesn't know what to do when item fails
17:53:20 <gzl> hmm
17:53:35 <Heffalump> do you know about MonadPlus?
17:53:39 <gzl> yes
17:53:54 <Heffalump> ok. On that webpage they use the operator (++) for it, but these days it's called mplus
17:54:05 <gzl> yeah, mplus and mzero
17:54:17 <Heffalump> you could write foo = do { c <- item ; cs <- foo ; return (c:cs) } `mplus` return ""
17:54:28 <Heffalump> (switching to braces-and-semicolons to save space)
17:54:55 <Heffalump> now, foo would be a parser that could either consume one item of input and recurse, or consume none and return an empty string
17:55:11 <gzl> hmm
17:55:26 <Heffalump> however, you'll find that it'll return many options
17:55:35 <Heffalump> one will be "consume no input, return an empty result"
17:55:45 <gzl> right
17:55:54 <Heffalump> the next will be "consume one character, return that character in a string"
17:55:55 <Heffalump> and so on
17:55:56 <gzl> returns stuff like [("foo",""),("fo","o"),("f","oo"),("","foo")]
17:55:57 <gzl> yeah
17:56:01 <Heffalump> (they'll actually come out in the other order)
17:56:34 <gzl> I see
17:56:34 <Heffalump> the point is that the parser library is designed to be non-deterministic
17:56:42 <gzl> and if I only wanted to get uppercase characters
17:56:59 <gzl> I could do the same thing with an isUpper parser instead of item, I suppose
17:56:59 <Heffalump> instead of using 'item', use 'upper'
17:57:02 <gzl> right
17:57:16 <Heffalump> anyway, going back to the non-determinism, you can control it
17:57:23 <Heffalump> for example, look at (+++) instead of mplus.
17:57:37 <Heffalump> that does a mplus, then throws away all but the first result
17:57:45 <Heffalump> so if you used it above, you'd get just ("foo","")
17:58:54 <gzl> right
17:59:27 <Heffalump> does that help? Have a look at the definitions of the combinators (particularly under the "Recursion combinators" heading) and see if you understand them now
18:00:32 <gzl> yeah, I'll do that
18:00:56 <gzl> so
18:01:03 <Heffalump> btw, it may help you to know that the Read class in Haskell is implemented in a similar style
18:01:10 <gzl> if you're doing something like that 'upper' parser
18:01:15 <gzl> hm, ok
18:01:24 <Heffalump> (although it doesn't declare a monad, it operates via the same datatype, ReadS a = String -> [(a,String)]
18:02:25 <gzl> if you're doing that 'upper' parser, if you pass it something like "gAh", it'll obviously return "" since it hits g, sees it doesn't satisfy upper, and then it'll fail
18:03:24 <gzl> so could you do something like
18:04:09 <gzl> foo = do { c <- upper; cs <- foo; return (c:cs) } +++ do { c <- lower; cs <- foo; return cs } +++ return ""
18:04:12 <gzl> ?
18:04:46 <Heffalump> yes
18:05:05 <gzl> hmm, good
18:05:52 <Heffalump> (/me notices the ignoring of the lower-case characters just in time to save himself from claiming it's equivalent to not splitting the upper and lower bits up :-)
18:06:17 <gzl> wait, what?
18:06:34 <Heffalump> in the lower bit, you return cs, rather than (c:cs)
18:06:54 <gzl> right.
18:06:55 <Heffalump> I was assuming that was deliberate and that you wanted to throw away the lower-case characters
18:06:59 <gzl> yep
18:07:23 <Heffalump> right; before I noticed that, I was going to say that it was equivalent to doing foo = do { c <- item; cs <- foo ; return (c:cs) } +++ return ""
18:07:33 <Heffalump> but I noticed just in time :-)
18:07:37 <gzl> ah, yeah
18:07:53 <gzl> ok, thanks a lot, I'll play with this a little and come back if I get stuck again
18:08:21 <Heffalump> well, I'm really going to bed now.
18:08:31 <Heffalump> but others may be around
18:08:44 <gzl> yeah, thanks
19:06:58 <KrispyKringle> gzl: what are you working on now?
19:07:05 <KrispyKringle> ooh. that was an hour ago.
20:50:56 <metaperl> any samples of database driven applications in Haskell? I just finished the tutorial at haskell.org and HaskellDemo.
20:50:59 * Lemmih squeezes his ClanLib binding + pong game down to 130 lines.
20:51:13 <Lemmih> @wiki HaskellDbTutorial
20:51:13 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDbTutorial
20:51:57 <metaperl> thanks
20:52:05 <Lemmih> You can also send raw SQL queries with HSQL.
20:52:16 <Lemmih> HaskellDB is pretty experimental.
21:02:09 <Lemmih> @seen shapr
21:02:09 <lambdabot> I saw shapr leaving #haskell 1 day 13 hours 36 minutes 50 seconds ago.
21:05:47 <tintin> Lemmih: hmmz can i have a look at your pong game ?
21:11:37 <Lemmih> Sure.
21:12:08 <Lemmih> One moment. **sending patch to darcs archive**
21:12:40 <dons> what ui does it use?
21:12:51 <Lemmih> Darcs?
21:12:58 * tintin builds up his imagination sky high 
21:13:00 <dons> pong.
21:13:16 <Lemmih> Oh ClanLib.
21:13:24 * tintin imagiens monstors in the pong game ready to gobble up the balls 
21:13:28 <dons> oh, sorry. yeah. /me scrolls up.
21:14:00 <Lemmih> tintin: It's _very_ simple (:
21:14:23 <Lemmih> Where's shapr? I can't upload my patch );
21:14:28 <tintin> hehe you did not have to break my bubble untill i checked it out :)

22:22:39 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
22:23:39 <beschmi> good morning ;)
22:23:59 <beschmi> i should really got to bed ..
22:24:17 <shapr> it's a beautiful day out there.
22:25:31 <Lemmih> Hey shapr.
22:25:45 <shapr> y0
22:26:15 <Lemmih> shapr: Seen my ClanLib binding + example Pong game in 130 lines of Haskell?
22:26:42 <shapr> nope
22:27:51 <shapr> is it in the repo as a demo?
22:28:32 <Lemmih> http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hclanlib/src/
22:28:58 <Lemmih> Pong.hs and Binding.hs
22:36:27 <shapr> Lemmih: nice pix
22:39:18 <shapr> tromp: your playground has gotten me interested in Kolmorogov complexity.
22:45:25 <Spark> :o
22:47:02 <Spark> i just got back from clubbing
22:47:06 <Spark> im a bit fried
22:47:13 <Spark> like a nice steak
22:47:18 <Spark> @type xx
22:47:23 <lambdabot> bzzt
22:51:45 <shapr> who's jmbr on del.icio.us?
23:13:04 <shapr> konichiwa seidan-san
23:16:17 <seidan> (o.o)!
23:17:05 <seidan> quiet today, eh.
23:17:34 <shapr> Everyone is frying their weekend lambdas. It's grill time.
23:17:58 <shapr> Have you written any cool code lately?
23:20:47 <shapr> There's community radio and community TV here, neither of which are much used. I've been thinking of organizing an English-only political show called "All Things Inconsiderate". I figure I can talk about Haskell and Category Theory and politics, and no one will know what I'm talking about anyway.
23:21:15 <seidan> not working code :). Actually, I was wondering about something:
23:24:23 <shapr> ?
23:24:25 <seidan> I need to learn more about the gc. For a physics simulation, if I have a function that maps one SystemState to the next in time, can I create a lazy list of the SystemStates and hope the gc throws out the old ones?
23:24:36 <musasabi> morning
23:25:02 <Lemmih> Greetings, musasabi.
23:25:38 <musasabi> hello Lemmih
23:25:44 <shapr> hyvÃ¤Ã¤ huomenta
23:28:09 <shapr> seidan: Monads let you do that correctly.
23:29:25 <seidan> I had a feeling that was what you'd say. I started reading more about monads.
23:29:58 <Gahhh> shapr, how much Category Theory do you know anyway ?
23:30:00 <seidan> I also want to create an hdf5 module to go alog with it.
23:31:21 <shapr> Gahhh: probably not enough to give you a good answer =)
23:31:51 <shapr> hoi boegel
23:31:57 <boegel> hey shapr
23:32:05 <boegel> you're the one I need :)
23:32:21 * Gahhh sniffs romance in the air
23:32:24 * shapr laughs
23:32:52 <shapr> Gahhh: I've got the Lawvere & Schanuel book, and I've read part of it. That's about it for my knowledge of category theory.
23:34:06 <shapr> Gahhh: what about you? read much CT?
23:47:03 <Gahhh> shapr, I tried reading some online, but I found that I don't have the necessary background. So I started reading other stuff such as set theory. I was not happy with the text, and I found a good logic text, so I've been reading first order logic since then. One day, I'll get back to CT.
23:49:52 <shapr> Gahhh: http://www.xp123.com/wwake/dissertation/model.shtml
23:51:13 <shapr> I'm beginning to think that necessary background isn't important with a sufficiently good explanation. Too bad explanations of that quality are in short supply.
23:52:55 <shapr> In any case, that page by William Wake was the first thing I read about CT. Since then, I've filled out my knowledge by reading about  about groups, like Abelian groups, and figuring out how they fit into everyday stuff like cryptology.
23:53:42 <shapr> The way I see it, concepts like groups and category theory are just everyday ideas given a rigorous backing.
23:55:32 <Gahhh> Yes.I wanted to read on abstract algebra first. It was even relevant to my day job.
23:55:56 <shapr> Neat, what's your day job? You've obliquely referred to it, but I don't think you've given it a name.
23:57:20 <Gahhh> I'm a software engineer at a hardware company.
23:57:48 <Gahhh> For the last year, I've been working on a dsp algorithm.
23:58:50 <shapr> You've used abstract algebra to improve your algorithm? Or you have an idea how it could be used for such?
23:59:40 <shapr> So, can I recruit you for TMR review of Matthew Donadio's Haskell DSP library? :-)
23:59:45 <Gahhh> I haven't. I just constantly regretted not knowing it since I had the vague feeling that it could have made my life easier.
