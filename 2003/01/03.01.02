03:21:37 <neniu> ping
03:22:44 <mgoetze> pong
03:25:11 <Heffalump> splat
03:27:48 <mgoetze> Heffalump: vorlon will happily argue about dpkg with you if the two of you meet in #advocacy ;)
03:29:15 <Heffalump> hmm
03:40:55 <Marvin--> what about dpkg?
03:41:24 <mgoetze> Marvin--: Heffalump says it's hard to create packages with
03:42:28 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I agree
03:42:56 <mgoetze> Marvin--: join #advocacy and wait for vorlon to wake up :)
03:44:37 <Marvin--> mgoetze: several people think it's hard, including Colin Walters who wrote up his own build system
03:45:17 <mgoetze> note someone attacking haskell in #advocacy atm
03:45:32 <mgoetze> note also that i didn't say i wanted to participate in the dpkg discussion :)
03:45:34 <Marvin--> haskell vs java? :)
08:14:49 <Janni> hi
08:54:19 <neniu> Anyone played with some GUI/Graphics Libraries in haskell?
08:56:30 * Syntaxpolice has only played with the Graphics library from SOE
10:22:42 <neniu> boo
11:36:42 <Syntaxpolice> do most versions of ghc produce compatable binaries that can be linked together?
11:36:59 <Syntaxpolice> Or does one always have to rebuild everything from scratch?
11:37:43 <Heffalump> I think the latter
15:12:13 <shapr> hi Pseudonym
15:12:16 <shapr> ltns
15:12:52 <shapr> Syntaxpolice: hey, you picked up haskell-mode?
15:13:29 <Pseudonym> G'day,
15:13:38 <Pseudonym> Comonads are hard.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> Well, they're probably no harder than monads.
15:13:58 <shapr> I've been idlying reading the thread about comonads
15:14:04 <shapr> what makes them unique?
15:14:10 * Pseudonym shrugs
15:14:17 <shapr> I saw that Ashley described some behaviour that comonads have that monads do not
15:14:24 <shapr> not that I had the least clue what he was talking about
15:14:34 <Pseudonym> I just posted my report of how I broke referential transparency with comonads.
15:14:42 * shapr checks his mail
15:16:21 <Syntaxpolice> shapr: yeah, I picked up haskell mode.
15:16:27 <shapr> cool!
15:16:54 <Syntaxpolice> shapr: In case you didn't see, I updated to 1.44 which fixed a couple of bugs that were open in debian.
15:17:14 <shapr> yah, I filed one of those bugs
15:17:19 <Syntaxpolice> ahh :)
15:17:27 <shapr> so I got a notification of fixage :-)
15:18:00 <Syntaxpolice> well, i'm slightly confuse because walters accidentally uploaded it as an NMU, so I'm not sure if it's just not hit the mirrors yet or if somethign else has to happen for it to progress.
15:18:21 <Syntaxpolice> but I'm pretty sure that I can't fix that (walters is sponsoring me at the moment) so I'm relying on him.
15:20:33 <Heffalump> if it got NMUed, it'll be delayed, won't it?
15:22:18 <Syntaxpolice> oh, actually the web page just isn't updated yet.
15:22:26 <Syntaxpolice> It wasn't supposed to be an NMU. I guess he fixed it.
15:22:35 <Marvin--> Heffalump: not automatically surely? depends on what queue you uploda to
15:22:47 <Heffalump> oh, true
15:57:20 <Marvin--> I can't figure out where to change monitor settings in windows 1.03, damn
15:57:59 <shapr> monitor?
15:58:29 <Marvin--> yeah, it asks me for monitor type when I install it, and I don't know what to put down since I'm trying it in vmware
15:58:39 <Marvin--> so I picked one at random, and it didn't work :)
15:58:53 <shapr> try telling it SVGA or something
15:59:05 <shapr> vmware docs may have info
15:59:59 <shapr> hi clausen
16:00:05 <shapr> how's the FS coming along?
16:00:05 <Marvin--> shapr: I think windows 1.03 predates svga :)
16:00:10 <shapr> oh wait
16:00:17 <shapr> microsoft windows 1.03 ???
16:00:27 <clausen> gday shapr
16:00:37 <clausen> shapr: I just noticed that I'm not supposed to get a "head start"
16:00:42 <clausen> shapr: so, I'm not writing any code yet
16:00:50 <clausen> I just got a 2 month job at sgi doing kernel hacking
16:00:52 <shapr> where did you notice that?
16:00:53 <clausen> so that should warm me up :)
16:00:54 <shapr> whoa cool!
16:01:08 <Pseudonym> Woohoo!
16:01:24 <Pseudonym> I assume that's Linux kernel hacking, not IRIX kernel hacking.
16:01:32 <clausen> Pseudonym: correct
16:01:34 <clausen> linux/mips
16:01:35 <shapr> I've been thinking about deferred efficiency == actual efficiency for months
16:01:43 <Pseudonym> SGI are still in the SEECS building?
16:01:49 <clausen> Pseudonym: ?!
16:01:55 <clausen> Pseudonym: they were?
16:01:59 <Pseudonym> They used to have half a floor.
16:02:01 <clausen> they're in camberwell now
16:02:02 <shapr> one of my friends just got Linux running happily on the Alchemy(?) mips platform
16:02:07 <Marvin--> shapr: yes, micros~1 windows 1.03 :P
16:02:08 <clausen> they're moving (not sure where to)
16:02:10 <Pseudonym> Six or seven years ago.
16:02:19 <clausen> aha
16:02:42 <clausen> http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/honours/marking/index.html
16:02:51 <shapr> from what he said, it took quite a bit of hacking to get linux running the Alchemy boards
16:02:54 * clausen needs to memorize that document, hehe
16:03:04 <clausen> shapr: I have no idea what I'm getting myself into
16:03:18 <shapr> want me to invite him over here?
16:03:20 <clausen> I'm friends with the linux/mips maintainer...
16:03:21 * Pseudonym got 80 on his
16:03:25 <clausen> ... not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing
16:03:27 <shapr> heh
16:03:30 <Marvin--> haha
16:03:33 <Pseudonym> Only just made it as a H1.
16:03:55 <clausen> Pseudonym: yeah, you told me about issues with zs :/
16:05:43 <shapr> hey this is my friend who has done some linux/mips stuff
16:05:45 * shapr points to mikaeli
16:06:07 <shapr> mikaeli: clausen is the guy who just got hired by SGI to do some linux/mips kernel hacking
16:06:08 <Marvin--> hi shapr's friend who has done some linux/mips stuff
16:06:11 <shapr> heh
16:06:31 <shapr> that's Marvin--, the (in)famous creator of the Modular Haskell Web Server
16:06:32 <clausen> hi mikaeli
16:06:50 <mikaeli> Hi. Yeah, I've done some work with AMD au1000 MIPS32 clone.
16:06:53 <Marvin--> shapr: I wouldn't know about neither infamous nor famous
16:07:12 <shapr> Marvin--: oh hey, still no one has mentioned your HWS-WP on the haskell list, eh?
16:07:17 <clausen> mikaeli: I have no idea what I'll be doing yet
16:07:21 <clausen> mikaeli: porting to some sgi machine
16:07:28 <Marvin--> shapr: well, at least I haven't, since I'm not subscribed...
16:07:32 <shapr> well then
16:07:43 <shapr> I'll have to mention it
16:07:55 <Marvin--> oh no, you really do want to make me infamous? :)
16:07:59 <shapr> yes really ;-)
16:08:10 <shapr> c'mon you work with Laura A Creighton
16:08:14 <mikaeli> clausen: working with au1000 was quite interesting. most of my work was porting device drivers for it.
16:08:17 <shapr> nothing can beat that
16:08:22 <Marvin--> haha
16:08:32 <shapr> do you actually talk to her much?
16:08:47 <Marvin--> when I'm at office, yeah, sure
16:08:52 <shapr> wow, what's it like?
16:09:08 <shapr> her online personality is rather unique
16:09:10 <mikaeli> clausen: I still have the dev board on my desk, but it takes some time to jump into coding C again :)
16:09:24 <clausen> mikaeli: ;)
16:09:30 <clausen> shapr: who's laura?
16:09:31 <Marvin--> she's rather unique period :)
16:09:58 <shapr> clausen: Laura A Creighton has been famous in computer folklore for years
16:10:31 <shapr> the "scratch monkey" story is the easiest to notice, but she's done much more than that
16:10:34 <Pseudonym> She's involved in the "scratch monkey" story.
16:10:45 <shapr> yah, "always mount a scratch monkey"
16:11:03 <shapr> Marvin-- actually works in the same company with her!
16:11:05 <shapr> is that cool or what?
16:11:11 <Pseudonym> It's very, very cool./
16:11:22 <Pseudonym> Biggest name I can drop is only Robert Elz.
16:11:23 <Marvin--> uhm, guys, you're scaring me
16:11:39 <shapr> just after she joined the Python world, when I was still a prominent #python citizen I invited her to show up on #python
16:11:41 <shapr> she did so...
16:11:45 <shapr> it was like...
16:11:47 <shapr> utter chaos
16:12:06 <mikaeli> Hmm, I've seen an interview with her somewhere.
16:12:24 <shapr> I think someone interviewed her for the latest EuroPython
16:12:31 <shapr> er, latest and first
16:12:37 <mikaeli> Yes, now I remember.
16:12:46 <Marvin--> yeah
16:13:07 <shapr> Pseudonym: Elz sounds familiar, but I can't remember any specifics, who's that?
16:13:14 <Marvin--> heh, she came into my office and was ranting about that and complaining about someone getting the stupid idea to interview her even though she was just going there, not giving a talk or anything
16:13:26 <shapr> she's just kind of automatically famous
16:13:58 <shapr> oh we should get her to show up on #haskell ....
16:13:59 <Pseudonym> shapr: He wrote quite a bit of BSD.
16:14:02 <shapr> oh wow!
16:14:21 <Pseudonym> shapr: Has a couple of early RFCs to his name.
16:14:27 <Pseudonym> shapr: That kind of thing.
16:14:31 <shapr> oh I should send an email to lac and ask her to show up and discuss her thoughts on purely functional programming.
16:14:39 <Marvin--> uh-oh :)
16:14:49 <Marvin--> well she likes haskell I know that much
16:14:54 <shapr> oh she does?
16:14:58 <shapr> hm!
16:15:07 * shapr looks for her addy
16:15:10 <Pseudonym> kre is most famous, though, for being a complete character.
16:15:13 <Marvin--> lac@strakt.com (duh)
16:15:17 <shapr> heh, ok :-)
16:15:19 <Pseudonym> There is only one photo known of him.
16:15:25 <Pseudonym> He works a six day week.
16:15:29 <shapr> wow
16:15:36 <Pseudonym> By which I mean he divides the hours in a normal week into six equal portions.
16:15:46 <shapr> cool!
16:15:51 <clausen> "I later left this company to go consult for a new start-up Company called Sun Microsystems in the United States"
16:15:54 <clausen> ^^ snob :P
16:16:01 <shapr> heh, who's that from?
16:16:04 <Pseudonym> The one photo, BTW, is on a MU CS department artifact.
16:16:12 <shapr> mu?
16:16:25 <clausen> shapr: http://europython.zope.nl/interviews/entries/laura_creighton
16:16:29 <shapr> ohh
16:16:31 <Pseudonym> The University of Melbourne(tm).  (They paid a lot of money for the word "the".)
16:16:34 <shapr> I'd forgotten that
16:16:44 <clausen> Pseudonym: they did?
16:16:49 <Pseudonym> Yes.
16:16:56 <Marvin--> as in bought the other university?
16:17:03 <shapr> anyone mind if I invite lac to show up and discuss her thoughts on purely functional programming and Haskell specifically?
16:17:05 <Pseudonym> As in giving money to the city council.
16:17:25 <clausen> shapr: why would anyone?
16:17:28 <clausen> Pseudonym: ?!!!
16:17:29 * shapr shrugs
16:17:35 * shapr sends email
16:17:42 <Pseudonym> shapr: Always up for a discussion.
16:17:53 <Pseudonym> clausen: In particular, they spent a fortune on branding.
16:18:15 <clausen> Pseudonym: well, it worked!
16:18:29 <shapr> Marvin--: wait, she was ranting about being invited to irc? or being asked for an interview?
16:18:48 <Marvin--> shapr: about the interview, all in good humour though :)
16:18:53 <shapr> oh, ok :-)
16:21:53 <shapr> ok, invite sent
16:22:12 <shapr> clausen: when does your mips work start?
16:22:18 <clausen> shapr: monday
16:22:22 <shapr> oh cool
16:22:23 <clausen> (no contract signed yet though)
16:23:05 * shapr tries to get his joystick working with devfs
16:23:34 <Marvin--> ugh, look at the time, I should've been in my bed an hour ago
16:24:10 <shapr> g'nite Marvin--
16:24:20 <Pseudonym> Night.
16:24:36 <Pseudonym> Oh, that's interesting.  Strakt is one of our competitors.
16:24:56 <Pseudonym> Of sorts.
16:25:02 <clausen> Pseudonym: you're in The Market TM?
16:25:18 <Pseudonym> This is Laura Creighton's company.
16:25:27 <Marvin--> Pseudonym: oh, should I glare evilly at you?
16:25:31 <Pseudonym> :-)
16:25:48 <Pseudonym> I think we have a different category of client, though.
16:25:58 <Marvin--> what are you doing?
16:26:17 <Pseudonym> Text databases.
16:26:37 <Pseudonym> Document-based application server stuff.
16:26:56 <Pseudonym> I hack the DBMS, though.
16:26:56 <Marvin--> uh, okay
16:27:04 <Pseudonym> CAPS is a similar kind of thing.
16:27:14 <shapr> Pseudonym: what's the name of your company?
16:27:39 <mikaeli> Uh, I've been working for 17 hours and getting seriously brain dead, have to get some sleep. Good night everyone.
16:27:48 <clausen> mikaeli: l8r m 8
16:27:52 <Pseudonym> The product is TeraText.  The company... well, it's either RMIT MDS, InQuirion or TeraText Solutions depending on the legal situation.
16:27:56 <shapr> g'night mikaeli
16:28:01 <Pseudonym> Night.
16:28:02 <Marvin--> Pseudonym: rofl
16:28:15 <Pseudonym> If you're a USian, you generally buy it from SAIC.
16:28:29 <Pseudonym> And you get consulting from TeraText Solutions.
16:28:37 <Pseudonym> If you're Australian, you buy from RMIT MDS.
16:28:41 <Pseudonym> And InQuirion owns the IP.
16:28:45 <Pseudonym> All rather confusing.
16:28:54 <Pseudonym> I work for RMIT, anyway.
16:29:04 <Marvin--> sounds complicated
16:29:09 <Marvin--> but I'm off for bed
16:29:10 <Pseudonym> Yes, it is.
16:29:18 <Pseudonym> There are all good reasons for it.
16:32:21 <clausen> Pseudonym: are you writing free software?
16:32:26 <Pseudonym> No.
16:32:34 <Pseudonym> AU$40,000 per CPU.
16:32:42 <clausen> :/
16:32:57 <Pseudonym> Needless to say, there are people who will pay this.
16:34:29 <Pseudonym> Very, very odd.  http://www.twotowersprotest.org/
16:34:32 <Pseudonym> Must be a troll.
16:35:44 <whee> that's a pretty dumb protest.
16:36:15 <whee> it's like protesting the release of any movie which includes pictures of the ground, because dead people often end up on the ground.
16:36:41 <whee> or any movie referencing the ground in any way
16:36:46 <hdaume> i love this: "The movie is intentionally being named The Two Towers in order to capitalize on the tragedy of September 11."
16:37:02 <shapr> that's bizarre
16:37:16 <clausen> LOL
16:37:36 <clausen> wasn't the name decided about 60 years ago?
16:38:09 <shapr> something like that
16:38:30 <clausen> funnily enough
16:38:35 <whee> they mustve known about the wtc then! terrorists!
16:38:37 <whee> :)
16:38:52 <clausen> I think those 2 towers play a similar role in today's (yesterday's) world
16:39:02 <clausen> like, they were the centre of the Evil Empire TM
16:39:41 * shapr sighs
16:41:00 <whee> we need to protest the protest of the movie because it's a protest designed to capitalize on the tragedy of September 11.
16:41:28 <kev_> lol
16:41:50 <clausen> they're probably in too much of an emotional tangle to be reasoned with
16:42:32 <Pseudonym> I'm half convinced it's a troll, but you never know.
16:42:43 <Pseudonym> It's a well known fact that 80% of people suck.
16:42:43 <Heffalump> the original petitiononline petition was a joke
16:42:52 <shapr> note how the number 11 is shaped like the word trade center. coincidence? I think not!
16:42:58 <Heffalump> but some bunch took this seriously, AFAICT, and set up another site that is real
16:43:45 <clausen> Pseudonym: yeah, it does feel like a spoof
16:43:52 * shapr tries to convinced devfs to notice his joystick
16:44:01 * whee reads that out of context
16:44:09 <shapr> um
16:46:21 <gdsx> whee: rofl
16:47:49 <Pseudonym> There isn't enough adolescent innuendo on #haskell, if you ask me.
16:48:08 <shapr> what about "mo' 'nads than you" ?
16:48:21 <Pseudonym> Not bad, not bad.
16:48:25 <shapr> :)
16:52:26 <whee> shapr: is it a thrustmaster joystick with plug and play?!
16:52:43 <shapr> nah, it's the very first consumer force feedback joystick
16:52:52 <whee> heh
16:53:06 <shapr> has a spot for a cooling fan even
16:53:19 <Pseudonym> Kinky.
16:53:31 <shapr> heh!!
16:55:29 <shapr> 8 axes, some large number of buttons
17:10:03 <shapr> hi lament
17:10:56 <lament> hi.
17:17:41 <Janni> re
19:06:35 <Pseudonym> Grrr.
19:06:54 <Pseudonym> I go for a half hour walk and when I come back, my cubicle is home to four chairs and a physio ball.
19:07:21 <Janni> Roarrr!
19:08:01 <Pseudonym> I agree.
19:16:08 <whee> you should disassemble all the chairs.
19:16:20 <Pseudonym> Well two of them are mine.
19:16:21 <whee> no, I don't know why :)
19:16:41 <Pseudonym> Well, whee, it'd be better than working.
19:16:49 * Pseudonym will give you that much
19:29:44 * lament is away: my tarantula is molting!!!!
19:30:01 <Pseudonym> I hate it when that happens.
19:55:23 <shapr> me too
20:09:51 <shapr> anyone tried to run HUnit tests in main?
