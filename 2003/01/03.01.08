00:11:01 <shapr> good morning
00:11:36 <shapr> has anyone tried running HUnit or QuickCheck tests in "main"?
02:21:13 * shapr notes that partial evaluation doesn't work in Python
02:21:50 * mgoetze notes that Python sucks :)
02:21:58 <andersca> oh it does not
02:22:00 <shapr> I like python
02:22:04 <shapr> but it's not Haskell
02:22:18 <shapr> otoh, Python has many libraries, Haskell does not.
02:22:32 <mgoetze> perl has even more libraries, and is otherwise better than python :)
02:22:38 <shapr> well
02:22:40 <andersca> mgoetze: I laugh at your ignorance
02:22:41 <andersca> ;)
02:22:47 <shapr> I can't deal with Perl
02:22:57 <mgoetze> andersca: and i at thine.
02:23:02 <shapr> too much magic for me
02:23:13 <shapr> so, the correct solution must be ... write libraries for Haskell!
02:23:18 <shapr> what library do we need most?
02:23:42 <shapr> I want news/email/file transfer protocols
02:23:48 <shapr> what do you guys want?
02:24:09 <mgoetze> hm
02:24:18 <mgoetze> postgresql :)
02:24:25 <mgoetze> and curses
02:24:34 <shapr> dark has a curses binding
02:24:43 <shapr> yah, postgresql would be valuable to me
02:24:45 <mgoetze> oh neat, i'll have to check it out
02:25:03 <shapr> seems there a bunch of different curses bindings
02:25:10 <shapr> we just need to standardize on one
03:17:37 * shapr bounces
03:18:20 <shapr> hi ian
03:23:19 <shapr> hi Arnia
03:23:21 <shapr> do you use Haskell?
03:23:35 <Arnia> Yes yes yes :)
03:23:53 <shapr> yay!
03:23:57 <shapr> what do you do with Haskell?
03:24:26 <Arnia> atm, play... I'm being groomed by one of my lecturers into a type theorist (not that I mind)
03:24:36 <shapr> oh, cool
03:24:49 <shapr> what uni?
03:25:00 <Arnia> Durham
03:28:03 <Arnia> brb
03:59:36 <shapr> hi Arnia
03:59:53 <shapr> if you can host a plone site somewhere
03:59:55 <Arnia> Hiya
04:00:06 <shapr> I think it'd be great for keeping a list of Haskell libs
04:00:29 <shapr> most of my paying work is for Zope
04:00:38 <Arnia> I should be able to... build a large dynamic community of haskell development
04:00:51 <shapr> cool
04:00:52 <Arnia> I'll sort something out :)
04:01:06 <shapr> cool, when will you know?
04:02:03 <Arnia> Later tonight probably... shouldn't be too many problems. The bandwidth should be pretty low to start with
04:02:09 <shapr> spiffy
04:03:07 <Heffalump> Haskell libs generally go into hierarchical modules don't they?
04:03:07 <Arnia> The skin will have to wait until I've finished building the skin for the Zope Repository (doc project) and the skins and iconsets I am doing for plone... but shouldn't be too long
04:03:54 <shapr> functionality is most important
04:04:00 <shapr> Heffalump: freshmeat for haskell
04:04:14 <Heffalump> hmm, right
04:05:23 <Arnia> With articles, an ezine, discussion boards, wikis, collectors and such stuff. Once I've written my project manager for plone, I'll install that too :)
04:05:44 <shapr> I'd be happy with a freshmeat kind of product
04:06:22 <shapr> Haskell Wiki does exist, even though it's unstable
04:06:35 <Heffalump> we have the mailing list for discussion though
04:06:37 <shapr> ezine would be cool
04:06:50 <shapr> post short articles about stuff you've learned in/with/for Haskell
04:06:57 <shapr> what kind of collectors?
04:07:47 <Arnia> Well, the power of plone is that its able to be set up to be community driven. Users could create their own wikis for various topics, add their own bug collectors for their projects, solicit feedback using discussions etc etc.
04:08:04 <shapr> ok, I want one.
04:08:23 <Heffalump> hmm.
04:08:44 <Arnia> Workflows are wonderful... :)
04:08:53 * Heffalump generally dislikes the proliferation of web-based stuff to do this kind of thing
04:08:58 <shapr> note that HOpenGL has one or two things that are asked about
04:09:04 <shapr> Heffalump: well, write something better ;-)
04:09:16 <Heffalump> well, wikis are useful
04:09:20 <shapr> that's true
04:09:21 <Heffalump> but news and IRC already exist
04:10:00 <Arnia> They aren't persistent, they aren't equiped with metadata
04:10:08 <shapr> we have irc logs
04:10:13 <shapr> news can be archived
04:10:17 <shapr> lack of metadata is a factor
04:10:19 <Arnia> Tried searching those?
04:10:22 <shapr> yah, I agree with that.
04:10:46 <Heffalump> well, I think the answer is to build something better around those, rather than running to the web
04:10:55 <shapr> Heffalump: like what?
04:10:57 <Heffalump> I find web-based discussion boards etc incredibly irritating
04:11:00 <Heffalump> dunno :-)
04:11:14 <Heffalump> if they also had an nntp or irc interface as appropriate, I'd be much happier
04:11:15 <Arnia> I don't have access to usenet, I often don't have access to IRC.
04:11:29 <shapr> well, as the pressure for me to work with PHP increases, so does my interest in getting stuff happening in the world of Haskell.
04:11:33 <Heffalump> you don't have to have the group on usenet, it just needs to talk NNTP
04:11:43 <Heffalump> likewise it can also be an IRC server
04:11:56 <Arnia> My irritation is with the lack of integration. I prefer solutions like Zope3.
04:12:03 <shapr> yah, zope2 is untestable
04:12:15 <shapr> unit tests are an integral part of my programming style
04:12:39 <shapr> from what I've heard of zope3 it will be far superior.
04:12:59 <Arnia> Zope2 isn't untestable, its just tough. Zope3 is exciting. Its a proper IA environment (my business is an IA consultancy so this thrills me some)
04:16:13 <shapr> what's IA?
04:16:17 <shapr> integrated architecture?
04:16:29 <Arnia> IA is information architecture
04:16:35 <shapr> what does that mean?
04:16:53 <shapr> btw, the showcase link on netally is broken.
04:17:25 <shapr> er, netalley
04:17:48 <Arnia> netalley-networks.com is broken. Test of a design before uni got in the way. Designing systems for managing large amounts of information sensibly
04:23:25 <shapr> have you written much Haskell code?
04:23:47 <shapr> do you understand the HM principle(sp?) typing system?
04:24:06 <Arnia> Hindley Milner... yes.
04:24:30 <shapr> code?
04:24:48 <Arnia> ?
04:24:50 <Heffalump> can you write a full HM typechecker? :-)
04:24:54 <shapr> heh
04:24:57 <shapr> Heffalump: can you? :)
04:25:23 <Heffalump> I'm fairly sure I can, though I've never actually done so
04:25:31 <Arnia> *blinks* if I had the rules for HM in front of me maybe
04:25:49 <shapr> looks like you've written Java, Python, and Perl at least.
04:26:11 * shapr bounces happily
04:26:18 <shapr> a plone site for Haskell will rock
04:26:24 * Arnia restrains shapr
04:26:29 <Arnia> Its not THAT amazing ;)
04:26:34 <Arnia> Ok... yes, it is but still
04:26:37 <shapr> I've been wanting one for months
04:26:42 <shapr> but I can't host
04:26:58 <Arnia> Paul Callaghan will hug me when I get back
04:27:06 <shapr> who's that?
04:27:18 <shapr> oh
04:27:41 <Arnia> My Haskell lecturer...
04:29:37 <shapr> oh, he's done a proof assistant.
04:30:31 <Arnia> Yeah, he's a type theorist being wasted by Durham. *wishes to destroy the Software Engineering bloc*
04:32:28 <shapr> have you read Rabhi and LaPalme's book "Algorithms, a Functional Programming Approach" ?
04:32:31 <shapr> I may have the title wrong
04:32:34 <shapr> but it's close
04:32:50 <Arnia> No, I haven't... *wonders if he can afford it*
04:33:12 <shapr> if you already know about lots of algorithms it may not impress you so much
04:33:23 <shapr> I had lots of a-ha moments while reading it.
04:34:35 <Arnia> :) I'll look out for it :)
04:47:14 * liiwi tackles shapr
04:56:02 <whee> hooray, I broke my ghc build (again) :|
04:56:15 <whee> that's what I get for trying to use hopengl. hehh
05:48:16 <shapr> hii liiwi
06:08:31 <shapr> hi jens_, ltns
06:09:37 <jens_> certainly is :)
06:09:44 <jens_> how are you doing?
06:38:16 <Segora> re
06:41:42 <shapr> jens_: doing fine, how are you?
06:42:16 <jens_> good thanks, just too much work recently
06:46:21 <shapr> what do you work on?
06:49:56 <shapr> hi flippo
06:51:58 <flippo> shapr: I feel a need to play with haskell once again.
06:52:07 <shapr> me too.
06:52:34 <shapr> questions?
06:52:59 <flippo> I'm curious about the type system
06:53:20 <flippo> I'm wondering how many errors will be caught at compile time
06:53:38 <shapr> many
06:53:54 <flippo> I didn't appreciate that last time I looked at it
06:54:04 <shapr> it took me a bit of time to learn to work with the type system rather than against it
06:54:56 <flippo> yet, I can write very generic algorithms with it.  Interesting
06:55:45 <shapr> the need to declare everything in C and Java has always irritated me
06:55:51 <shapr> that's one of my favorite features in Haskell
06:55:58 <shapr> compile time dynamic typing
06:56:02 <shapr> aka type inferencing
06:56:05 <shapr> hi Tusaki
06:56:18 <Tusaki> hi: how do I convert/cast an "IO String" to a "String"
06:56:19 <Tusaki> hia
06:56:33 <shapr> Tusaki: you can't, but you can work within the IO monad
06:56:52 <Tusaki> can I read characters then perhaps? I just want to read a line from a string and parse it
06:56:56 <Tusaki> i mean a line from a file
06:56:59 <shapr> yes, you can do that.
06:57:02 <Arnia> First degree polymorphism
06:57:11 <shapr> but it has to happen within the IO monad
06:57:15 <Tusaki> could you give me an example please? :)
06:57:57 <Heffalump> what's the function you have that gives you an IO String?
06:58:04 <Heffalump> and what's your parsing function?
06:58:11 <Tusaki> readPolynomialFromFile:: String -> IO String
06:58:46 <Tusaki> stringToPolynomial:: String -> [Int]
06:59:43 <Heffalump> do text <- readPolynomialFromFile filename
06:59:55 <Heffalump>    return (stringToPolynomial text)
07:00:02 <Heffalump> will be something of type IO [Int], if that helps
07:00:35 <Tusaki> is there no way to get out of the IO monad?
07:00:58 <Heffalump> in general, if you have something of type IO a, you can get the a out by doing "foo <- ioa" inside a "do" block, and then you can work with it inside the "do" block, but in the end you have to return something and that will end up back in the IO monad
07:01:02 <Heffalump> nope, it's a safety thing
07:01:17 <Heffalump> if there was a way of getting out of the IO monad, then Haskell would stop being a "pure" language
07:02:11 <Heffalump> [to avoid the charge of telling lies, there /is/ a way, but you should only ever use it with an extremely good reason, and it's very unlikely that your program really needs that]
07:02:33 <Tusaki> ah ok, tnx. i'll write some functions for working with files and 'normal' strings
07:02:35 <Heffalump> note that your top level function "main" is of type IO (), so in the end you don't actually need to be outside the IO unit
07:03:06 <Heffalump> basically, you can write a bunch of code that expects non-IO types, and then use a top-level "do" block to read the stuff from the file and call your non-IO functions
07:03:36 <Tusaki> ah. and could this work? inside the 'do' block I use the IO String with another String function (which returns String) .. if I return that, will it be a String or an IO String?
07:05:02 * shapr has the sudden urge to play MTG
07:05:15 <Heffalump> return :: a -> IO a
07:05:23 <Heffalump> if that helps
07:06:12 * Tusaki is testing ...
07:06:56 <Tusaki> it wines about " Last generator in do {...} must be an expression"
07:07:02 <Tusaki> whines even
07:08:30 <Heffalump> how long is your code?
07:09:06 <Heffalump> if not very, then paste it here
07:09:11 <Tusaki> within the 'do'? 2 lines (the lines you gave me) ... the rest is 201 lines
07:10:03 <Tusaki> function = 
07:10:03 <Tusaki> 	do text <- readPolynomialFromFile "poly.txt"
07:10:03 <Tusaki>    	return (stringToPolynomial text)
07:11:03 <ustenzel> might be a problem with indentation.  did you type a tab in front of the return?
07:11:15 <Tusaki> yes
07:11:31 <Igloo> You need the spaces after the tab, not before it
07:12:10 <ustenzel> actually you need 4 space there and no tab.  or three spaces and a tab, if the space after do is actually a tab.
07:12:31 <Igloo> There is a tab before the do
07:12:34 <Tusaki> k that works... <tab> before do and <tab><space><space>before the other line
07:12:57 <Igloo> I assume you really have 3 spaces if it's working
07:13:12 <Tusaki> 3 yes. :) is haskell that picky?
07:13:21 <Igloo> Yes
07:13:51 <ustenzel> I suggest you put a newline after the do, then indent the following lines exactly the same way
07:13:54 * Heffalump would recommend avoiding tabs altogether, though others may have recommendations on making them work sensibly
07:13:56 * shapr figures out how to add .lhs support to the quickcheck script
07:13:58 <ustenzel> or get your editor to expand tabs.
07:15:23 <Heffalump> yeah, and not leave them in the source file
07:16:15 <Tusaki> Im not too sure about tabs.. I like them.. but they do mess up code in other ppl's editors... 
07:16:55 <Heffalump> yes, and the layout actually affects the language in Haskell
07:17:07 <Heffalump> (which is a convenient feature in some ways, but incredibly annoying in others)
07:18:59 <Tusaki> ok. tnx alot. I've written a wrapper function to use files and strings with the other functions... 
07:19:00 <Tusaki> filefunc filename function argument = 
07:19:00 <Tusaki> 	do text <- readPolynomialFromFile filename
07:19:00 <Tusaki> 	   return (function (stringToPolynomial text) (stringToPolynomial argument))
07:19:08 <Igloo> Does anyone know where I think I've seen something about debugging GHC segfaults?
07:19:54 <Heffalump> Tusaki: right, if that's what you need
07:25:17 <shapr> Igloo: I can't find anything in a short troll of the last 1700 ghc-users messages
07:27:58 <shapr> Igloo: already looked at Chilli's guide to GHC?
07:28:05 * shapr can't think of anything else
07:29:32 <Igloo> Yeah, I think I might have imagined it
07:31:08 <shapr> only info I find anywhere just says "use gdb"
07:32:58 <Heffalump> eek?
07:33:04 <Heffalump> is that really feasible?
07:33:17 <Igloo> Maybe I should ask Simon how he does it
07:33:58 <shapr> one of the simons gives the GDB advice
07:34:31 <shapr> seems that michaelw used gdb to debug ghc on sparc-unknown-linux
07:36:02 <shapr> looks like that's how Wolfgang got GHC working on MacOS X
07:37:22 * Igloo wonders if this sefault is just GHC not liking 20M of generated code
07:37:44 * shapr snickers
07:38:09 <shapr> I sure wouldn't to read 20M of code at once.
07:38:39 <shapr> I think Arnia has a point, the mailing lists aren't easily searchable
07:38:52 <shapr> happily I keep everything locally.
07:39:38 <Heffalump> what were you doing generating 20M of code?
07:39:50 <Igloo> Autogenerating test cases
07:40:15 <shapr> are you using a nightly build?
07:40:29 <Igloo> No, CVS as of a few hours ago
07:40:33 <shapr> oh
07:40:51 * shapr updates
07:41:00 <Igloo> Why?
07:41:07 <Heffalump> public CVS only updates nightly, doesn't it?
07:41:07 <shapr> figured I'd try it.
07:41:26 <Heffalump> remember Igloo has access to the real CVS :-)
07:41:28 <Igloo> Dunno when, but once every 24 hours I think, yeah
07:41:32 <shapr> oh, good point.
07:41:44 <shapr> he's a man with members only access.
07:41:55 <Igloo> It's not hugely different, although it has one fewer fails-to-build bug  :-)
07:42:03 <shapr> actually, I think I have cvs access also, but I've forgotten the password to my other ssh2 key.
07:45:32 <Heffalump> shapr: to real CVS? I thought that was only for committers?
07:46:19 <shapr> Heffalump: I was a contributor to YAHT, which I think is in the real CVS
07:46:32 <Heffalump> ah
07:46:50 <shapr> if I hadn't lost my password, I would still be a contributor.
07:47:43 * shapr hates forgetting stuff like that.
07:48:00 <shapr> hey, random question
07:48:31 <shapr> do you guys keep your desk/hard drive/computer room very organized, or cluttered, or what?
07:49:07 <Heffalump> mine is generally a huge mess
07:49:10 <shapr> my room and desk are cluttered, but I keep my drive very organized, just wondered how other people do things.
07:49:15 <Heffalump> I occasionally have fits of tidying
07:49:21 <Heffalump> my home directory likewise
07:49:29 <Heffalump> I try to install software only from packages, though
07:49:47 <shapr> I think I'm nearly obsessive about keeping my system clean.
07:49:54 <shapr> rather the opposite for desk/room
07:52:20 * Igloo is about the same as Heff
07:53:05 <shapr> along the same lines, do you keep a list of things that need to be done, or do you just remember, or what?
07:54:47 <Heffalump> I keep trying to keep lists, and very quickly ignore them
07:56:05 <shapr> I lose my lists.
07:56:31 <shapr> though I've found it helps to keep them in emacs on my obsessively clean drive
07:58:26 <Igloo> I mainly keep mental lists
08:03:14 <Heffalump> http://urchin.earth.li/photopub/range?range=/users/ganesh/banana/2687-2690&titlehash=/users/ganesh/banana/AtpAmGPVPG&style=/across has some pictures of my office I just took
08:03:53 <shapr> great pix :-)
08:04:02 <shapr> nice monitor
08:04:26 <Heffalump> yes, I like it a lot :-)
08:04:37 <shapr> that's pretty much what my office looks like.
08:05:02 <shapr> except mine is covered in music CDs as well
08:05:13 * Heffalump realises the information about fire strikes is out of date
08:05:50 <Heffalump> it's sad that I have to look at a digital camera photo of my own office to notice this...
08:06:14 <shapr> well, new perspective
08:15:52 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: I have a little function that I bound to f3 in emacs which opens up a file called "notesDATE" in outline mode, and opens up a new one every day.
08:16:07 <SyntaxPolice> or switches to the notes buffer if its open or whatever.
08:16:29 <shapr> I wish emacs had better task support
08:17:15 <shapr> or Haskell :-)
08:20:26 <shapr> hey, did you see the guy who's asking for haskell + emacs stuff on ghc-users?
08:20:40 <shapr> I'm writing about my one-button testing with quickcheck
08:22:26 <SyntaxPolice> no, I haven't been reading ghc-users
08:22:41 <Heffalump> what kind of haskell+emacs stuff?
08:24:55 <shapr> adding args to ghci (I've mentioned ~/.ghci )
08:25:12 <Heffalump> ah
08:25:14 <shapr> jumping to first and next errors (I'm telling about compile-command and C-x `)
08:25:49 <shapr> I'd like to figure out how to run HUnit tests from main as well
08:42:28 <shapr> hah, new error
08:42:29 <shapr> cc1: bad value (athlonmp) for -march= switch
08:42:30 <shapr> cc1: bad value (athlonmp) for -mcpu= switch
08:44:59 <shapr> does -fvia-C use a specific version of gcc?
08:48:03 <Teggy> G'day all.
08:48:05 <shapr> hi Teggy
08:49:40 <shapr> anyone know where in the ghc build process -march and/on -mcpu are set?
08:50:37 <shapr> alternatively, does ghc require a certain version of gcc when building via-C ?
08:52:44 * shapr reads docs
09:09:36 <hdaume> shapr: i don't think it requires one, but i've had some problems with non 2.95.? versions
09:11:35 <shapr> I have multiple versions of gcc installed. Even though the default gcc is 3.2.2, it seems that the build process is finding an earlier version that doesn't support athlonmp
09:12:06 <shapr> and yet, the build process also correctly discovers that I'm using an athlonmp and fills in that switch... confusing.
09:14:19 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: are you using haskell-mode in gnu emacs?
09:14:24 <shapr> I'm using ERC Version 3.0 $Revision: 1.357 $ with XEmacs 21.4 (patch 10) "Military Intelligence" XEmacs Lucid!
09:14:56 <SyntaxPolice> OK, I'm finding this error in trying to uncomment a region in the gnu emacs version only.
09:15:10 <shapr> how do you uncomment?
09:15:22 <SyntaxPolice> C-u M-x uncomment-region
09:15:24 <SyntaxPolice> er
09:15:28 <shapr> I use C-u comment-region
09:15:28 <SyntaxPolice> C-u M-x comment-region
09:15:37 <SyntaxPolice> but i have comment-region bound
09:15:54 <shapr> yah, I have comment-region on H-c
09:16:20 <shapr> I need to hack up comment-dwim
09:16:39 <shapr> which would only affect this line if there's no region
09:16:39 <SyntaxPolice> uncomment leaves a leading space at the beginning of everything which is very annoying.
09:17:37 * shapr tries locally
09:18:14 <shapr> works fine
09:20:13 <SyntaxPolice> it works in xemacs for me too
09:20:57 <shapr> does comment-region have that extra space in other major modes as well?
09:22:32 <SyntaxPolice> Yeah, I think so
09:22:52 <SyntaxPolice> (defun comment-line "Comments a single line" () (interactive)
09:22:52 <SyntaxPolice>   (save-excursion
09:22:52 <SyntaxPolice>     (let ((point1 (progn
09:22:52 <SyntaxPolice> 		    (beginning-of-line)
09:22:52 <SyntaxPolice> 		    (point)))
09:22:53 <SyntaxPolice> 	  (point2 (progn
09:22:54 <SyntaxPolice> 		    (end-of-line)
09:22:56 <SyntaxPolice> 		    (point))))
09:22:59 <SyntaxPolice>       (comment-region point1 point2))))
09:23:09 <SyntaxPolice> that is my gift to shapr for the day :)
09:23:13 <shapr> yay!
09:27:53 <SyntaxPolice> woops I screwed up the doc string
09:28:01 <SyntaxPolice> put the () before the doc string, not after
09:28:38 <shapr> hey, have you tried ERC?
09:29:06 <SyntaxPolice> no.
09:29:21 <SyntaxPolice> what's ERC?
09:29:28 <shapr> it's an elisp irc client
09:29:36 <shapr> quite spiffy
09:29:40 <kev> eeeugh
09:29:44 <shapr> the guys on #emacs are writing it
09:30:05 <whee> haha
09:30:08 <shapr> they've just added DCC GET support, though you need to have gnumacs cvs to use it.
09:30:14 <whee> I don't know if I'd want that at all.
09:30:19 <shapr> it's quite nice actually
09:30:30 * whee hates emacs anyway 
09:30:31 <SyntaxPolice> oh. I used to use zenirc, but I gave up partly because emacs only has one thread
09:30:32 * whee ducks
09:30:47 <SyntaxPolice> so if I backgrounded emacs or did some big computation, then the server would boot me off
09:30:47 <shapr> yah, emacs lack of multithreading is a real wart
09:30:52 <SyntaxPolice> plus xchat is pretty good
09:31:05 <shapr> I want HaMacs that works like PyMacs
09:31:23 <SyntaxPolice> one thing I did like was that it was really easy to search backward in chat logs and copy and paste code
09:31:25 <shapr> then I can extend emacs with Haskell
09:31:29 <SyntaxPolice> (I guess thats two things)
09:31:40 <shapr> I'm fond of M-$ and M-/
09:31:44 <shapr> very useful in irc
09:32:05 <shapr> plus it's fun to be able to add /yow with one line of code :-)
09:32:17 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
09:32:38 <shapr> oh, and I have H-f bound to ffap, so that means I can instantly jump to urls, etc with a single keystroke
09:32:43 <whee> I've always wanted an irc client that was a bit more dynamic
09:33:01 <shapr> oh, and I have a lojban-translate-region defun which is handy on #lojban
09:33:09 <whee> all I've seen these days assume text that has been said is done and over with, and it's just listed
09:33:32 <whee> it'd be nice to have perhaps automatic cross-referencing and other things
09:33:54 <shapr> I really like erc
09:34:50 <shapr> if the speedbar developer would fix his code, erc would be much like mIRC in interface
09:35:13 * shapr is too lazy to fix the speedbar code himself
11:06:46 <Janni> hi
11:06:49 <shapr> y0
13:42:46 <ludde> is it possible to reduce (\x.x)
13:43:10 <Heffalump> no
13:43:20 <ludde> ok
13:56:24 <xkb> hehe
13:56:26 <xkb> oops
13:56:29 <xkb> wrong channel
15:39:25 * kunphuzil [~kunphuzil@user-38ldi82.dialup.mindspring.com] has already been joined to #haskell
15:39:30 <kunphuzil> :P
16:13:04 <Master_of_Reason> ok I was told that the highest average IQ on IRC was found on freenode anyone want to help me with a problem and proove this statement?
16:13:41 <Heffalump> what's the problem for?
16:14:00 <Master_of_Reason> ahhh finally a response
16:14:55 <Master_of_Reason> I have downloaded a program called page author and determined that it compeletely meets my needs and is superior in everyway to all of the oposing solutions the problem is this i only have the shareware version and even as a programmer I haev never cracked any software and need this one cracked
16:15:30 <Master_of_Reason> Im not sure that it has ever been cracked as I have not been able to find it anywhere
16:15:35 <Heffalump> ah.
16:15:37 <Master_of_Reason> can you help?
16:15:39 <Heffalump> no.
16:15:47 <Heffalump> this is a Haskell channel.
16:15:56 <Master_of_Reason> do you know of anyone or anywhere that maybe able to help
16:16:02 <Master_of_Reason> what the hell is haskell anyway?
16:16:10 <Heffalump> see http://haskell.org
16:16:12 <Heffalump> and no, I don't.
16:17:11 <kev> wth?
16:17:14 <kev> much randomness
16:17:16 <dark> How did you end up here anyway?
16:17:40 <Master_of_Reason> about 3 hours ago some one told me to download irc and try looking there
16:17:57 <Heffalump> *sigh*
16:17:58 <Master_of_Reason> and then about 15 minutes ago someone told me the highest average IQ on IRC was on freenode
16:18:06 <kev> did they laugh hysterically afterwards?
16:18:17 <kev> Master_of_Reason: was their name 'lilo' ?
16:18:24 <Heffalump> I doubt anyone here is interested in helping you pirate software, and even if they were this wouldn't be an appropriate place to do it.
16:18:34 <Master_of_Reason> and about 3 minutes ago I randomly selected this page off of the list
16:18:40 <Heffalump> So unless you want to stay here and be laughed at some more, please go away.
16:18:42 <Master_of_Reason> and I understand pirating software is bad ect ect
16:19:25 <Heffalump> Unless we can interest you in learning Haskell, but I somehow doubt that.
16:19:33 <Master_of_Reason> but damn it I have been coding for 3 years I have never pirated a single piece of software I own a legit legal copy of Microsoft Developer Studio 2500$ but I just cant bring myself to pay 195$ for a program with one function no matter how badly I need it
16:19:34 <kev> Master_of_Reason: good, so go pay for it
16:19:54 <Heffalump> Well, don't then.
16:19:59 <Heffalump> Just stop bothering us about it.
16:20:04 <kev> yep
16:20:10 <Master_of_Reason> that I can do
16:20:20 <kev> *sigh*
16:20:20 * Igloo rolls his eyes
16:20:26 <dark> You know he's just going to ask the same question again on another channel.
16:20:31 <Heffalump> yeah, well
16:20:38 <Heffalump> maybe he'll run into an IRCop somewhere
16:21:12 <Igloo> What's the opers channel called on FN?
16:21:21 <kev> #ilovelilo
16:21:24 <Heffalump> :-)
16:21:29 <dark> "highest average IQ on irc" sounds about as flattering as "tallest dwarf in Moria".
16:21:30 <Heffalump> are you going to msg him and suggest he try there?
16:21:34 <Heffalump> rotfl
16:21:51 <dark> #freenode is probably best for that.
16:21:53 <Heffalump> I initially thought he was doing a survey to prove it.
16:21:54 <kev> 00:21 [OPN] -!-  channels : #open-source #flood
16:21:57 <Igloo> Well, on DALnet it was #dragonsrealm or similar, so I would have suggested it if I'd thought about it while he was here
16:22:07 <Igloo> #opers wouldn't work as well, though
16:22:24 <kev> couldn't we just punt him on to #php ? ;)
16:22:45 <Heffalump> :-)
16:22:51 <Heffalump> naah, #imperative
16:22:54 <Heffalump> (if that exists)
16:23:18 <dark> Maybe #debian?  200 people can tell him to install linux instead of fiddling with binary-only crap :)
16:23:39 <Heffalump> anyway. Bed calls
16:23:41 <kev> yeah, two years later we could have another stallman zealot, hurrah!
16:24:28 <Pseudonym> Indeed.
16:24:37 <Pseudonym> Arguably it would be an improvement, of course.
16:25:21 * kev pictures in ten years time, people knocking on my door trying to tell me about how the GPL can save my soul
16:25:28 <Pseudonym> Still, isn't it lovely that #haskell is "random"?
16:26:03 <dark> Near the middle of the alphabet, I guess.
16:26:52 * Pseudonym shuders at what passes for "Reason" these days
16:27:23 <Pseudonym> "Someone told me this, then someone told me this, then I picked one at random..."
16:27:33 * kev checks "free cracks for shareware here" isn't in the topic

16:29:49 <Pseudonym> That's better.
16:30:24 <kev> hmmm...
16:30:29 <kev> maybe I should start a #iq
16:30:44 <kev> where geeks can battle it out with the iqbot to obtain the title of highest iq on freenode
16:30:53 <Pseudonym> There's an iqbot?
16:31:07 <whee> I think the people with the highest iqs would be smart enough to not waste their time
16:31:08 <dark> kev: Failure to participate is an automatic win?
16:31:27 <kev> winner gets a lifetime subscription to some high-iq society cult
16:31:39 <Pseudonym> You could see how IQ decreases over the course of the participation.
16:31:46 <dark> We could offer to "crack" their code -- insert random newlines, etc.
16:33:19 <dark> Hmm, maybe I should make a utility that makes a jagged line through a window, and use it to create "cracked versions" of programs.
16:34:27 <emu> why would anyone look for crack on IRC, I wonder
16:34:49 <kev> emu: surely _everyone_ on irc smokes it?
16:35:09 <kev> I can't think of anything else to explain it
16:40:31 <Pseudonym> You know, I've been reading over what that guy said again:
16:40:46 <Pseudonym> I just cant bring myself to pay 195$ for a program with one function no matter how badly I need it
16:41:01 <Pseudonym> It's occurred to me that we could have given him programs with lots of functions.
16:41:23 <whee> hhaha
16:47:46 <dark> We could calculate the cost per function of haskell programs versus C :)
16:49:03 <whee> dark:  I'll give you two C variables, an O'Caml function, and a pointer for a haskell function 
16:49:28 <Pseudonym> I see you, and raise you an IORef.
16:50:07 <whee> this could become as popular as pokemon trading cards.
16:50:16 <dark> whee: What kind of pointer?  I don't give much for void pointers, you never know where they've been.
16:50:41 <Pseudonym> What's the going rate for dynamic_cast<>?
17:03:42 <dark> Would you say that english is dynamically typed while latin is statically typed?
17:03:58 <Heffalump> lol
17:04:10 <Heffalump> how do you define the distinction between dynamic and static here?
17:04:12 <dark> I wonder what the natural language equivalent of a typeful language would be.
17:04:25 <Pseudonym> There isn't one.
17:04:35 <Heffalump> I think all natural languages are fairly typeful
17:05:01 <Pseudonym> All natural languages are highly ambiguous.
17:05:07 <dark> Heffalump: In latin all words are type tagged, and you can determine the grammatical correctness of a sentence just by looking at those type tags :)
17:05:19 <Heffalump> dark: that's explicit versus implict typing, though
17:05:27 <Heffalump> s/implict/implicit/
17:05:48 <Heffalump> English is the Haskell of natural language, since we have to use type inference to work out most things :-)
17:05:52 <dark> Hmm, but in English you sometimes have to evaluate the meaning in order to figure out the grammar.
17:06:10 <dark> With the classic example, "Time flies like an arrow.  Fruit flies like a banana."
17:06:43 <Heffalump> hmm, true
17:06:44 <Pseudonym> So Latin is kind of like Hungarian notation.
17:06:56 <Pseudonym> English is the Lisp of natural languages.
17:07:07 <Pseudonym> No, actually that's not true either.
17:07:10 <Heffalump> I think there are things like that in Latin too, though
17:07:11 <Pseudonym> Lisp has a simple syntax.
17:07:19 <Heffalump> but I've forgotten too much to be able to construct one.
17:07:25 <Pseudonym> English is the C++ of natural languages.
17:07:58 <Igloo> Nah, English is the perl
17:08:10 <dark> Pseudonym: Because of overloading?
17:08:12 <Igloo> You can do all sorts of things that look entirely random
17:08:32 <Igloo> And verb nouns and all sorts
17:08:35 <dark> English doesn't use enough punctuation to be perl :)
17:09:28 <Pseudonym> dark: Because it's horribly complex, it's a bastard child of every other language, it's inherently ambiguous in multiple way and because it's very very powerful.
17:10:18 <dark> Pseudonym: That does sound like perl, though.
17:11:04 <Pseudonym> That depends.  Is English concise?
17:11:10 <Pseudonym> It's not write-only.
17:11:35 <dark> I think it's concise, but I've seen Finnish.
17:12:19 <Pseudonym> It's nowhere near as concise as Latin or Greek.
17:12:29 <dark> Chinese is probably more concise, but that's more like APL :-)
17:13:44 <Pseudonym> I have a theory that you will find more philosophers in a language where it's easier to be vague.
17:13:54 <Pseudonym> e.g. English, German, Greek
17:14:08 <dark> In what languages is it hard to be vague?
17:14:17 <Pseudonym> Arabic?
17:14:21 <dark> Latin has that delicious passive voice.
17:14:23 <Pseudonym> That's just a guess, mind.
17:14:40 <Pseudonym> How vague can you be in Finnish?
17:15:00 <dark> I don't know enough Finnish to answer that :)
17:15:09 <Pseudonym> It's hard to be vague in Indonesian and Tok Pisin, I know that.
17:15:37 <Pseudonym> But they're pretty recent as lanugages go, so it's not a fair comparison.
17:15:45 <dark> I think there are lots of Arabic philosophers, they're just not translated much.
17:16:03 <Pseudonym> This is true, so maybe you can be vague in Arabic.
17:17:28 <dark> Any language where "two fruits of car" is a normal expression has something going for it.
17:20:48 <Pseudonym> What does that mean?
17:21:45 <flippo> I just learned more from a few pages of "A Gentle Introduction to Haskell 98" than I previously learned from an entire book about Haskell
17:22:28 <flippo> Until the type system made sense, the rest was just syntax
17:23:07 <flippo> Hallelujah
17:24:17 <flippo> Somehow I never notice before that the language was statically typed because it seemed to define generic functions
17:24:32 <flippo> But the types were inferred.  How clever.
17:25:43 <dark> Pseudonym: I'm not sure if it was Indonesian or Malayan :)  But the language had various counting-words, and only those could be used for counting.  Animals were generally counted in tails, food in fruits, etc.  
17:25:51 <flippo> (My book described standard algorithms with a functional approach, using Haskell.  But it didn't really tell me why Haskell was special.)
17:26:05 <dark> Pseudonym: New words (such as the one for automobile) had to be made to fit into the existing counting scheme.
17:26:23 <Pseudonym> Right.
17:26:38 <dark> flippo: Then the book wasn't really "about Haskell" :)
17:26:52 <flippo> dark: indeed it wasn't
17:27:15 <flippo> I hate it when I start with the wrong book.
17:27:29 <flippo> Wasted two years I could have been playing with this cool language
17:27:30 <dark> I hate it much more with fiction books :)
17:28:13 <flippo> This type system seems to fix everything that makes me uneasy about python
17:28:30 <dark> I wish I knew who invented the trilogy, and who convinced bookstores it was a good idea to always carry only the latest book in a series.
17:29:24 <inkedmn> anybody want to play chess?
17:29:26 <inkedmn> :)
17:35:40 <whee> I'd play if I didn't suck.
17:35:56 <inkedmn> trust me, you'd probably beat me
17:36:09 <inkedmn> i JUST started playing 2 days ago
17:36:28 <whee> I havent played in a year osr so :)
17:38:51 * Heffalump hasn't played for ages either
17:39:03 <Pseudonym> I tend to suck too.
17:39:13 <Heffalump> and yes, I tend to suck also :-)
17:39:17 <Pseudonym> I know lots about chess theory but still don't look wide enough at each mood.
17:39:21 <Pseudonym> each move, sorry
17:39:22 <Heffalump> but having declared that, I don't mind playing
17:39:28 <Pseudonym> So I tend to be beaten by very simple tactics.
17:40:46 <Pseudonym> Lunch.
18:28:15 <Pseudonym> Oddest bug.
18:29:14 <Pseudonym> I ssh into a machine and ls /dev, and the session hangs.
18:29:37 <Pseudonym> I do the same only redirect into a file and it works.  I then cat the file and it hangs.
18:29:42 <Pseudonym> I try to scp the file out and it hangs.
18:29:47 <Pseudonym> But I can ftp the file out.
18:29:58 <Pseudonym> For some reason, ssh doesn't like some character sequence in the file.

22:50:49 <Pseudonym> Expensive, too.
22:51:03 <Pseudonym> Cheaper to buy a DVD, almost, and you can even have better alcohol that way.
22:51:05 <shapr> no alcohol served in usa movies
22:51:39 <Pseudonym> Ah, there's no romance in the cinema any more.

22:51:58 <Pseudonym> Oh, even better.

22:54:46 <Jerub> ggrr
22:55:04 <Pseudonym> I've never thought of alcohol as an aid in labour.
22:55:24 <shapr> it has been used that way
