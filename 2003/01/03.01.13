04:44:56 <shapr> gooood morning #haskell!
05:03:37 <Arnia> shapr: heya
05:16:57 <shapr> from http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ManifestTyping
05:17:07 <shapr> It should be pointed out that there's a huge difference between PrecambrianTypeSystems? as found in C and Java, and ModernTypeSystems? as found in Haskell and ML. -- StephanHouben
05:17:16 * shapr laughs
05:17:50 <Arnia> :)
05:18:03 <shapr> hiya Arnia
05:18:06 <shapr> what's up?
05:18:31 <Arnia> Not much... learning how to use the CMFTypes framework :)
05:21:25 * shapr bounces
05:21:37 <shapr> I feel good today.
05:21:47 <shapr> Igloo: I've been reading before and after, thanks again for writing them :-)
05:22:40 * Arnia finds a seagull and inspects it
05:23:09 <shapr> oh neat
05:24:56 <Arnia> shapr: I have a strange typing idea ;)
05:25:29 <shapr> what is that idea?
05:25:49 <shapr> oddly, the one thing I contributed to TheWiki is keeping a list of Pages I've created and a list of pages I enjoy and want to inspect.
05:30:04 <Arnia> This pertains to HM type systems... allow the declaration of 'transformer' functions that change one type into another and which are explicitly typed. If the HM type system finds a type that seems ill-formed, check through the list of transformers for the *most specific* transformer. If such a transformer is found, use it and flag a warning. Otherwise, abandon as being ill-typed.
05:30:26 <Arnia> The transformer declaration on a function is a declaration by the programmer that the function is semantically preserving.
05:31:44 <shapr> you got that from Zope Interfaces, didn't you?
05:32:25 <Arnia> No... I got that from thinking about generalising type coercion.
05:34:20 <shapr> I don't know enough about the HM type system to discuss the subject.
05:34:28 <shapr> it sounds good
05:34:37 <Arnia> Ah well... I'll email Paul about it
05:35:10 <Arnia> Or Luo
06:03:16 <shapr> god morgon, mr. Sjögren
06:06:02 <Marvin--> god morgon, mr. Erisson
06:06:08 <Marvin--> (why are we so formal? :)
06:07:42 <shapr> well, I think Sjögren is a neat word by itself, and I wanted to type it.
06:07:56 <shapr> took me three days to find a good opportunity to do o.
06:07:57 <shapr> so
06:08:39 <mgoetze> is "mr." proper swedish? don't you have something like "herr"?
06:08:40 <Marvin--> haha
06:08:56 <Marvin--> yeah, "herr" is Swedish, but it's very very seldom used
06:09:04 <shapr> what do you usually use?
06:09:26 <Marvin--> we don't use such a word at all
06:10:00 <Marvin--> we had this whole "du" reform
06:10:10 <mgoetze> so, "god morgon, Sjoegren" would be usual?
06:10:26 <mgoetze> Marvin--: oh? did you get rid of "sie" or it's equivalent?
06:10:29 <Marvin--> using just the surname is kinda stiff too, we're very into first names in Swedish
06:10:32 <Marvin--> mgoetze: yup
06:10:46 <Marvin--> "you" can be translated to "du" and "ni" depending on the formality, like in German
06:11:03 <shapr> We are the Knights who say "du"
06:11:20 <Marvin--> but "du" is sort of "official use", there are no formal or informal rules on using du or ni, everybody is du
06:11:21 <mgoetze> and the "ni" is abolished? is it the same in other nordic languages?
06:11:32 <Marvin--> I don't know about other languages
06:11:56 * mgoetze will ask a norwegian when he gets the chance
06:11:57 <Marvin--> you don't have to "ni" (and lay off the Monty Python references, please! :) people who have "higher standing" than yourself
06:12:15 * mgoetze could do without the "sie" :)
06:12:17 <Marvin--> so "ni" is these days only a plural form of "du"
06:12:32 * Heffalump HNJ, BWJLTS "ni!"
06:12:53 * Marvin-- glares at Heffalump
06:13:06 <shapr> ?
06:13:16 * shapr tries to expand that acronym
06:13:23 <Heffalump> oh, sorry, you said lay off the references :-)
06:13:27 <Heffalump> I didn't spot that bit.
06:13:33 <Heffalump> or indeed shapr's.
06:14:49 * shapr notes that lambda.weblogs.com has an article on Joy
06:16:56 <Marvin--> it also has an article on D :)
06:17:13 <shapr> I hear good and bad things about D
06:18:54 <Marvin--> I think it's looking nice compared to C, but I've also heard that it looks bad compared to Eiffel :-=)
06:19:49 <Marvin--> The question is, can they manage to make C/C++ more high level while still keeping high speed and small executables?
06:20:03 <Marvin--> for me, working on an installer, executable size is very relevant
06:20:23 <shapr> I want an OS written in Haskell.
06:20:34 * shapr thinks of a LispM clone, HaskellM
06:20:49 <mgoetze> shapr: you make it, i'll buy one
06:21:24 <shapr> heh
06:21:44 <shapr> there was a thread about hardware STG machines a few months ago
06:21:59 <shapr> I think it was Simon PJ who said "it's just not economically worthwhile"
06:34:22 <shapr> I heard that US cars were recently found to be Touring Complete
06:35:29 <mgoetze> most german cars probably have been for a long time...
06:35:52 <Marvin--> with computers in cars, there's no reason for them NOT to be Turing complete
07:59:57 * shapr bounces
08:00:21 <shapr> so, anything interesting happening in the world of Haskell?
08:03:21 <Igloo> I've rather reached a standstill on all fronts
08:03:56 <Marvin--> I'm seeing Koen tomorrow to talk about the master project
08:04:02 <Marvin--> hopefully I can get started next week
08:06:34 <Igloo> Cool
08:06:39 <Igloo> How's yours going, shapr?
08:24:18 <Janni> hi
08:24:33 <Janni> hi
08:24:52 <Igloo> Yo
09:29:14 <shapr> Igloo: the monads are beginning to seep into my brain
09:29:40 * Arnia hands shapr a monad sponge
09:29:57 * shapr squeezes it over his head
09:30:31 <Igloo> Cool  :-)
09:30:43 <shapr> the before and after is really making it work
09:32:11 <Marvin--> I'd written simple monads before, but it wasn't really until I took the AFP course this fall that I really got into them
09:32:37 * Heffalump wants to find some new uses for arrows
09:32:54 <shapr> imho, arrows are the way of the future
09:33:13 * Arnia gets some books on category theory and devours
09:33:27 <shapr> arrows let you move more of the effort from runtime to compile time
09:33:36 <shapr> they let you take advantage of the type system
09:33:52 * Heffalump thinks shapr frequently overstates the case for arrows, especially given the limited number of uses of them so far
09:33:55 <shapr> heh
09:33:56 <shapr> maybe so :-)
09:34:07 <Arnia> Anything which lets me use type systems...
09:34:08 <shapr> have you read the Yampa paper?
09:34:18 <Marvin--> they're pretty complicated, even with the special syntax
09:34:30 <Marvin--> IMO
09:34:40 <Heffalump> of course, the fact that ArrowApply == Monad is nice, especially since the special syntax roughly reduces to monad syntax then
09:34:45 <Heffalump> but yes, they are
09:35:03 <Heffalump> I'd claim I'm fairly intelligent, and it took me quite a while to get the hang of monads.
09:35:14 <shapr> I would agree with you ;-)
09:35:24 <shapr> er, the first part.. I dunno how long monads took you :-)
09:35:35 <Heffalump> somewhere inbetween months and years
09:35:38 <shapr> objects took me awhile as well.
09:35:49 <Heffalump> I got objects the first time I read about them.
09:35:49 <shapr> lots of staring at them and wondering just what the heck they were trying to do
09:36:21 <shapr> I was sitting outside reading and boom! I got it.
09:37:50 * Arnia loves both objects and monads and functions and all things typey as well
09:37:55 * Arnia is probably sectioned
09:38:04 <shapr> sectioned?
09:38:20 <Arnia> Committed to an insane asylum
09:38:23 <shapr> ah
09:41:15 <shapr> hi hal
09:50:05 <shapr> from what I understand of Arrows, for most applications of Monads they could be used, and would be more efficient
09:50:14 <shapr> is that incorrect?
09:50:51 <Heffalump> they can always be used as the framework in place of monads
09:51:17 <Heffalump> I only know of two applications where doing so gives real benefits - Swierstra-style parsing combinators, and FRP (Yampa)
09:52:01 <Heffalump> I would be in favour of Haskell 2 supporting Paterson's arrow syntax as well as current monad syntax within the same framework
10:00:29 <shapr> hi smkl
10:14:36 <shapr> hi smklsmkl
10:40:02 <smkl> hello shapr
10:40:54 <shapr> hi, how's life?
10:41:52 <smkl> ok
10:42:11 <shapr> haven't seen you around here much, is real life cutting down on your code time?
10:43:12 <smkl> nope, i'm just having a hopefully creative pause
10:43:22 <shapr> heh :-)
16:31:47 * Igloo groans at "and by the comments of an anonymous referee (\lambda paper.comments paper)"
16:33:17 <hdaume> Igloo: wha?
16:34:28 <Igloo> In the acknowledgements of http://www.it.kth.se/~kff/semantics.ps.gz (p62)
16:35:03 <hdaume> why are you groaning at it, tho?
16:35:38 <Igloo> It's a pun - anonymous referee, anonymous function
16:38:24 <Igloo> (seeing it in more context may help)
16:43:27 <hdaume> ahhh, i get it okay
16:43:31 <hdaume> groan is right
16:43:56 <Igloo> :-)
16:44:03 <Igloo> I'm sorry to have wasted 10 minutes of your life
16:44:51 <hdaume> hehe
19:44:32 * d33p is away: xyxo yp iyeb pemusxq lecsxocc!
19:58:05 <lament> heh
