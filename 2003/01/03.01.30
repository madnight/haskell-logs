00:00:19 <det> Is there any library for haskell implementing remote objects ?
00:14:22 <det> how about does haskell have asynchronus sockets, ala select() ?
00:42:06 <det> hrmm, ghc supports select()
00:44:39 <Marvin--> ye
00:44:41 <Marvin--> doh
00:53:47 <Marvin--> welcome back
00:53:52 <Marvin--> and, yes ;)
01:24:52 <det> me?
01:25:46 <Marvin--> you what?
01:26:18 <det> your previous statement, was wondering if you were answering one of my numerous questions
01:26:56 <Marvin--> I'm not sure if   <det> hrmm, ghc supports select()   was a question, but that was what I was answering
01:27:28 <det> oh, my internet decided to commit suicide, didnt know the last thing I said
01:35:14 <Marvin--> <det> hrmm, ghc supports select()
01:35:15 <Marvin--> <-- det has quit (Remote closed the connection)
01:35:15 <Marvin--> <Marvin--> ye
01:35:15 <Marvin--> <Marvin--> doh
01:47:25 <det> ohh
01:48:19 <det> it doesn't appear sockets can be put in non-blocking mode, however :/
01:50:13 <Marvin--> I'm not sure... My socket usage in haskell is limited to a toy web server so I wouldn't know
01:50:34 <Marvin--> but we used select there and it worked pretty good
03:52:21 <det> blah, it is impossible to get HOpenGL working under windows
06:47:35 <shapr> boing
06:47:45 <shapr> I didn't know about paralell list comps
06:47:55 <shapr> I haven't figured out what they're good for either...
06:48:56 <Marvin--> zip?
06:49:06 <shapr> can you show me an example?
06:49:08 * shapr feels dense
06:49:20 <shapr> I saw that mention of zipWith (+)
06:50:00 * shapr rereads that 
06:50:06 <Marvin--> yeah, you'll be able to combine zipWith and filter, not just map and filter
06:50:29 <shapr> oh, I think I get it
06:50:35 <shapr> sort of like nested list comps, yah?
06:50:52 <Marvin--> nested in what way?
06:51:30 <SyntaxPolice> g'morning, all.
06:53:17 <Marvin--> 'lo
06:57:21 <shapr> g'mornin SyntaxPolice 
06:57:42 <shapr> hey, I tried to figure out some way of bypassing the approval process
07:05:07 <Marvin--> what approval process?
07:05:20 <shapr> the one for http://shapr.homelinux.net/
07:06:47 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: the only problem should be that awaitingApproval.txt is a file with lists on each line, but the lists aren't surrounded by a list or separated by commas.
07:06:57 <shapr> yah, I was thinking about that
07:07:13 <shapr> the simple hack is to put "," at the beginning of each saved record
07:07:19 <SyntaxPolice> so when dumping them to a file, the first time, an extra '[' must be added, and each time after that, a comma must be put at the beginning.
07:07:19 <SyntaxPolice> yeah
07:07:26 <SyntaxPolice> but the tricky part is (to me...)
07:07:26 <shapr> and then copy "[" awaiting.txt "]" 
07:07:35 <shapr> er, "cat"
07:07:48 <SyntaxPolice> deleting the old "]" and puting in a new one after the new entry
07:08:00 <shapr> don't need to
07:08:13 <shapr> only add the start and end braces when creating the static page
07:08:26 <shapr> cheesy hack, eh? :-)
07:08:47 <SyntaxPolice> ahh, so sorta run the "make static page" script at the same time?
07:09:19 <shapr> yah
07:09:33 <SyntaxPolice> that works... any luck w/ the categories?
07:09:35 <shapr> makeStaticPage would stick the start and end braces on, and then run itself
07:09:48 <shapr> what about the categories?
07:09:49 <SyntaxPolice> I see.
07:09:49 <Marvin--> won't you have a fence error with the commas?
07:10:00 <shapr> yes
07:10:49 <SyntaxPolice> you could also alter makeStaticPage to read a file of lists instead of a list of lists.
07:11:00 <SyntaxPolice> not a big change.
07:11:05 <shapr> that would be simpler
07:11:43 <SyntaxPolice> the categories is the only major thing I thought left really.  I wanted the output page to be organized depending on what categories they select, "program development, compilers" etc.
07:11:54 <shapr> good point
07:12:18 <shapr> I'd like to see wget called to grab a local cached copy for the downloa durl
07:12:20 <SyntaxPolice> and so the information is there, you just have to read in the elements into a FM and output them according to the keys.
07:12:25 <shapr> yah
07:12:40 <SyntaxPolice> actually, a download URL would be a good first step :) RIght now there's only a project URL.
07:13:06 <SyntaxPolice> but we should talk to the web people@haskell.org to see if they want to keep a cached copy.
07:13:41 <shapr> I'd like to
07:14:09 <shapr> notice how the libraries formerly located at numericquest.org have dropped off the net
07:20:29 <SyntaxPolice> yeah, I noticed htat some time back.
07:20:51 <SyntaxPolice> the haskell.org web people said they'd mirror them, but never got around to it.
07:20:56 <SyntaxPolice> they're in the web archives somewhere.
07:54:14 * shapr bifs
07:54:21 <dark> bif?
07:54:30 <shapr> it's like .. less than half a bounce
07:54:41 <dark> Hmm.  Sounds dodgy.
07:54:46 <shapr> it is
07:54:49 <shapr> I was aiming for a full bounce
07:54:54 <dark> Ah, low ceiling?
07:55:09 <shapr> nah, too far under the desk
07:55:12 <dark> Heh.
07:55:21 <dark> I've been trying to play egoboo but I get 000 FPS :)
07:55:31 <shapr> I have lots of fps with egoboo
07:55:33 <dark> Maybe I should get myself a real graphics card.
07:55:38 <shapr> what do you have now?
07:56:03 <dark> S3 Virge
07:56:04 <shapr> I like the parts of egoboo that I played, but some stuff I just couldn't figure out
07:56:15 <shapr> I did have fun blowing away gazillions of wolves with that gatling gun
07:56:25 <shapr> the dwarf with the shotgun is great too
07:56:30 <shapr> boom! chick-chock
07:56:47 <dark> In what way is it like nethack, btw?
07:56:50 <shapr> especially if your buddy gets killed and you have two shotguns... whee!
07:57:09 <shapr> it's sort of like OpenGL nethack 
07:57:34 <dark> Yeah but what are the actual similarities?
07:57:54 <shapr> you can pick up or drop items
07:57:57 <shapr> you can use items
07:58:04 <shapr> you can swap stuff from being held to your inventory
07:58:12 <shapr> you can have friends that go around with you
07:58:22 <shapr> you're trying to get to the next level
07:58:31 <shapr> there are switches to stand on
07:58:33 <shapr> spells to cast
07:58:50 <shapr> it's very cool
07:59:01 <shapr> if it had network multiplayer I'd probably play it all the time
07:59:10 <shapr> but the authors got bored before they finished the network code
08:01:41 <dark> shapr: This might be an interesting game for me to work on if I can get it to run :)
08:01:54 <dark> shapr: Which card would you recommend for a free software zealot, btw?
08:02:27 <shapr> radeon
08:02:35 <shapr> I've heard their drivers are truly open source
08:02:39 <shapr> and nvidia will make you crazy
08:03:22 <shapr> nvidia cards are cheaper
08:03:34 <shapr> they perform very well compared to nearly anything else
08:04:00 <dark> Yeah but nvidia is evil enough that even a graphics agnostic like me has heard of them :)
08:04:23 * Janni is back from cleaning the street from snow (much today)
08:04:42 <Janni> s/street/sidewalk (i'm not crazy ;)
08:04:42 <mgoetze> yeah, it's just picking up here
08:04:50 <mgoetze> started snowing around 2 or so
08:04:59 <shapr> dark: even so, nvidia cards work really well until the drivers roll over and die
08:05:01 <dark> "Beware, there will be g200 and nvidia ppl. If you have some evidence to back you up on the other gods. You, a newly trained evoker, have been heralded from birth as the start of a true debian maintainer."
08:05:23 <shapr> of course, when the drivers die, your whole box locks solid and you have to hit the reset button.
08:05:36 <mgoetze> lol
08:05:57 <shapr> that does *not* make me happy
08:06:06 <shapr> whenever you see me ping timeout from irc
08:06:11 <shapr> it's always those drivers.
08:06:12 * mgoetze passes shapr a sysrq key
08:06:21 <shapr> sysreq doesn't even work when the drivers die
08:06:24 <shapr> I've tried
08:06:38 <shapr> I can still ping my box
08:06:40 <shapr> but nothing else
08:06:51 <mgoetze> usually you have to do some blindtyping
08:06:52 <dark> shapr: Hmm, the drivers lock up even when you're not playing anything graphical?
08:07:05 <shapr> dark: no, only when you're using OpenGL
08:07:18 <dark> mgoetze: Last time I had to do that was when my monitor died :)  I was in the middle of a conversation, had to break it off gently without seeing anything.
08:07:35 <dark> shapr: Aha, so you're on irc while playing games, you evil person :)
08:07:47 <mgoetze> sysrq-k to kill off the xserver, unraw, switch to another console, login, use fb (you do have fb, don't you?) to switch the card back to a sane mode.
08:08:23 * dark doesn't have fb but was thinking of getting it to see if it makes egoboo playable.
08:08:33 <shapr> can't use fb with nividia
08:09:00 <shapr> dark: it's true, I play crack-attack when I need a break
08:09:01 <dark> That earlier quote was from megahal, btw :)
08:09:20 <dark> shapr: "Right, shapr, which driver do you want us to break?"
08:09:36 <shapr> heheh
08:09:50 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: you know crack attack was created here at Ohio State :-)
08:09:59 <shapr> mgoetze: I can't send any keyboard input when my system locks
08:10:01 <shapr> I can only ping
08:10:04 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: no I didn't know that!
08:10:12 <shapr> I'm aiming to beat the high score on that website
08:10:53 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: it was packaged by my good friend and Go arch-rival walters :-)
08:11:08 <mgoetze> shapr: can you log in remotely?
08:11:08 <shapr> neat!
08:11:13 <shapr> mgoetze: nope
08:11:15 <shapr> only ping
08:11:23 <mgoetze> shapr: that's weird
08:11:34 <mgoetze> shapr: maybe you should merge openssh and the linux kernel ;)
08:11:50 * mgoetze still sucks at go :(
08:13:12 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: you should play me, then :)
08:13:17 <shapr> or me
08:13:21 <SyntaxPolice> we should make a Haskell Go playing team on yahoo or something :-)
08:13:21 <shapr> I've only played once.
08:13:24 <shapr> yes yes!
08:13:25 <mgoetze> lol
08:13:37 <mgoetze> you can play go on yahoo games?
08:13:42 <SyntaxPolice> yup.
08:13:54 <mgoetze> wow
08:14:03 <SyntaxPolice> but I made up the 'teams' thing.
08:14:30 * mgoetze used to play chess there, a long time ago
08:16:14 <mgoetze> well, if someone tells me what to do to get xmodmap to load an english keyboard layout, i'll switch to a graphical interface and we can play somewhere ;)
08:17:04 <shapr> setxkbmap us
08:17:08 <shapr> or setxkbmap qwerty
08:17:10 <shapr> I forget which
08:18:16 <Segora> the first one
08:18:27 <shapr> hi radix!
08:18:36 <radix> Hello!
08:19:04 <Janni> what is this "Go"?
08:19:21 <mgoetze> i'll try that... brb
08:19:44 <shapr> Janni: it's a game... 
08:19:51 <shapr> beware, your life can be sucked into it :-)
08:20:24 <Janni> shapr: *installing* :)
08:20:32 * shapr grins
08:22:34 <mgoetze> w00t... it works
08:22:43 <mgoetze> and this computer even has fvwm and rxvt
08:23:13 <dark> Let me know if anyone would like to maintain cgoban.
08:23:47 <mgoetze> dark: i already let you know... ;)
08:24:56 <dark> mgoetze: oh, yeah.
08:25:09 <dark> mgoetze: But you wanted me to sponsor, or something :)
08:25:29 <mgoetze> dark: details, details...
08:25:47 * mgoetze wonders whether netscape 4.77 will be good enough for yahoo go
08:26:45 <radix> Yo, people :)
08:27:03 <radix> How would you structure something like a virtual-world simulation in Haskell? I've only ever done such things in object-oriented languages before
08:27:23 <shapr> what kind of vw?
08:27:27 <shapr> a mud?
08:27:34 <shapr> everquest? :-)
08:27:42 <radix> Yes.
08:27:46 <radix> Like either of those.
08:28:02 <shapr> if it were a mud
08:28:17 <shapr> I'd use typeclasses for stuff like "open" "pick up"
08:28:45 <radix> presumably, the simulation systems could be used in either a MUD or something like EQ
08:28:54 <radix> shapr: Well, what about the actual simulation of physical objects?
08:28:57 <radix> I'm not really concerned with the verb stuff, yet
08:29:05 <shapr> what do you mean?
08:29:21 <shapr> can you give me an example?
08:29:47 <radix> hrm
08:30:00 <radix> Well, people are objects, rooms are objects, chairs are objects, swords are objects
08:30:05 <radix> (in the real-life sense)
08:30:13 <shapr> yah?
08:30:24 <shapr> you mean how would I implement a chair?
08:30:34 <radix> So how would you define such structures in Haskell?
08:30:37 <radix> Yes.
08:30:40 <SyntaxPolice> dark: how is cgoban, is it much of a pain?
08:30:51 <radix> Which can be sat upon, of course. And then nobody else would be able to sit in the chair while someone is sitting in it.
08:30:54 <Marvin--> there's no implicit inheritance, but you can still do it by delegation I guess
08:30:55 <mgoetze> so, who wants to play go on yahoo now?
08:31:05 <shapr> I'd probably use complex datatypes at first
08:31:23 <shapr> but I think monad transformers to build a modular interpreter could be better
08:31:26 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: I'd love to, but gotta work... maybe during my lunch hour or something?
08:31:27 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I've only played go twice, I don't even remember the rules :)
08:31:33 <dark> SyntaxPolice: No, it's pretty easy.  There's one difficult bug that I've simply given up on.  Upstream is very nice but no longer maintains it; he's working on cgoban2 instead, which is for a completely different set of Go servers so it's not an upgrade from my point of view.
08:31:43 <mgoetze> Marvin--: that's ok, it won't let you make an illegal move ;)
08:31:57 <Marvin--> mgoetze: gee, thanks ;) I don't even remember how to win
08:31:58 <shapr> if Arrow transformers exist, that would be best
08:31:59 <radix> hrm
08:32:00 <mgoetze> Marvin--: i'll give you lots of handicap stones!
08:32:13 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I wouldn't know how to use them! :)
08:32:19 <SyntaxPolice> dark: interesting... I remember having to do some black magic to get it to let me play against the computer... its an odd program.  I'll think about it :-)
08:32:20 <mgoetze> Marvin--: you win by covering as much territory as possible with your stones
08:32:29 <dark> I don't think I'd even try to build a mud in haskell, I'm way too used to doing it in LPC.  I'd never be able to make the mental twist.
08:32:31 <mgoetze> Marvin--: of course, you have to make sure your stones can't be captured
08:32:32 <radix> shapr: So how do you say "the chair is now being sat in", and "the chair is now available for sitting in"?
08:32:32 <Marvin--> mgoetze: well, yeah, in those broad terms, yes
08:33:01 <shapr> dark: think of it as a modular interpreter
08:33:13 <dark> shapr: You mean, write an LPC interpreter in Haskell? :-)
08:33:14 <mgoetze> Marvin--: to capture a group of stones, they have to be surrounded completely (no "liberties" left)
08:33:28 <Marvin--> radix: you could either have a Bool to indicate whether someone's sitting in the chair, or you can have a 'Maybe a' as a possible "pointer" to whoever's sitting in the chair
08:33:29 <shapr> dark: no, I was thinking of a pure haskell mud :-)
08:33:52 <mgoetze> Marvin--: so, to make them uncapturable, you just form them so that there are at least two spots where the opponent would die immediately if he put a stone there
08:34:03 <Marvin--> mgoetze: die?
08:34:17 <mgoetze> Marvin--: well, his stone would get captured if he put it there
08:34:29 <shapr> radix: yah, how is that different from an OO solution?
08:34:30 <dark> shapr: The players might complain about having to type "mapM_ (takeWhile (alive . enemy) (repeat hit))"
08:34:44 <shapr> heheh
08:34:45 <radix> shapr: Uhm, I don't know. It sounds pretty OO to me. :-)
08:34:46 <Marvin--> mgoetze: oh, like that
08:34:58 <Marvin--> dark: ROFL
08:35:00 <mgoetze> Marvin--: yeah... i'll give you more tips as we go along
08:36:35 * SyntaxPolice doesn' thave the java pluggin at the moment.
08:36:35 <Marvin--> mgoetze: as I said, I've only played it twice and that was years ago ;) where do I start?
08:36:35 <mgoetze> Marvin--: just go to games.yahoo.com, click on go, register (or sign up) and then go to zebra cove
08:36:35 <Marvin--> sign up? sigh
08:36:35 <dark> radix: It depends a bit on how far you want to go.
08:36:35 <mgoetze> Marvin--: well, unless you already have a yahoo id
08:36:39 <dark> I mean, physically there's nothing to stop two people from sitting on one chair, if they're small enough.
08:36:51 <Marvin--> mgoetze: why would I have that? :/
08:36:54 <radix> dark: Yes, I know. I'm keeping it simple. :-)
08:36:57 <radix> I'm pretty cluless yet.
08:36:58 <dark> Also, multiple incorporeal people could share a chair.
08:37:16 <mgoetze> Marvin--: webmail, groups, other games, instant messenger...
08:37:21 <dark> It's also possible to pick up a chair and use it to bash people on the head, but not if someone heavy is sitting in it.  But if it's someone light, they could hang on to the chair during the bashing.
08:37:31 <dark> This kind of reasoning led me to abandon the idea of making a mud :-)
08:37:48 <mgoetze> dark: just follow the KISS rule ;)
08:37:59 <radix> dark: Yes, well
08:38:04 <Marvin--> sheesh, they want to know my whole life story just to let me play Go?
08:38:13 <dark> radix: Are you planning something text-based or graphics-based?  The approaches are wildly different.
08:38:28 <radix> dark: Well, the general simulation terms are pretty similar, from what I've seen
08:38:30 <dark> Marvin: Yahoo is evil and spams.  Don't do it.
08:38:37 <radix> dark: containment is totally different, though
08:38:43 <radix> which is pretty fundamental, but still
08:38:47 <dark> There's other Go servers out there.  Such as the ones used by cgoban2 :)
08:39:02 <radix> My friends and I have come up with a very interesting way to compose different behaviors into an object
08:39:39 <shapr> what is it?
08:39:54 <dark> http://kgs.kiseido.com/
08:39:58 <radix> It involves Interfaces and Adapters
08:40:02 <Marvin--> oh for christ sake, how the hell am I going to remember the ID "sjogren23847162351452"?
08:40:26 <Marvin--> ah, cool, my university account name wasn't taken though :)
08:40:29 <mgoetze> Marvin--: uhm... pick a different id? ;)
08:41:10 <dark> radix: if you include "location" in "containment", perhaps.
08:41:19 <radix> dark: yes
08:41:37 <radix> but the adapters thing can still be used the same in either simulation, which is cool
08:41:51 <radix> we've discovered adapters are a powerful tool for simulation :)
08:42:10 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I'm in, I guess
08:42:53 <mgoetze> Marvin--: my netscape crashed, i guess ;) hold on
08:43:15 <Marvin--> heh
08:43:18 * mgoetze will have to install a new browser on this machine
08:43:20 <radix> The cool thing is, you can delegate containment with adapters as well :-)
08:45:33 * Janni is becoming addicted (without really being able to play yet)
08:47:09 * mgoetze is playing with Marvin-- on yahoo :)
08:47:23 * Marvin-- is totally lost
08:48:05 <SyntaxPolice> marvin - move in the corners first
08:48:08 <mgoetze> Marvin--: don't worry, you'll get the hang of it
08:48:09 <SyntaxPolice> then take the sides.
08:48:12 <SyntaxPolice> then move to the center.
08:48:18 <SyntaxPolice> what size board?
08:48:27 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: 9x9, 5 handicap for him ;)
08:48:31 <SyntaxPolice> hehe OK :)
08:48:39 <Marvin--> phone
08:48:44 <SyntaxPolice> I've never been able to beat a beginner w/ 4 handicap on a 9x9
08:48:45 <mgoetze> ok
08:48:54 * mgoetze waits for netscape to crash.
08:49:02 <Marvin--> err, no, they hung up, oh well
08:49:04 <mgoetze> well, a smart beginner like Marvin-- ... hehe
08:49:22 <Marvin--> I have *no* idea what I'm doing
08:49:49 <mgoetze> you're doing ok so far ;)
08:50:03 <Marvin--> I am? oh, good, I guess
08:50:08 <dark> Marvin: Assume that mgoetze does know what he's doing :)  So concentrate on defense and connecting your stones, not on killing the white invader.  Containment is the key.
08:50:33 <mgoetze> lol... sure i know what i'm doing
08:50:48 <mgoetze> this is why i recently lost on 13x13 with 7 handicap stones...
08:50:57 <dark> Marvin: Of course, once mgoetze sees you doing this, he's going to start bluffing :)
08:51:10 * mgoetze kills 3 of Marvin--'s stones
08:51:40 <dark> In high-handicap games, the white player often has to make unsupportable moves.
08:51:42 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I noticed
08:52:05 <mgoetze> Marvin--: don't worry, you're still winning
08:52:23 <Marvin--> oh, good
08:52:25 <Marvin--> I guess
08:53:07 <mgoetze> dark: wanna come and watch? ;)
08:53:15 <Marvin--> no, don't! :)
08:53:28 <dark> mgoetze: Would I have to register for it?
08:53:39 <mgoetze> dark: if you don't already have a yahoo id... yeah
08:53:50 <mgoetze> Marvin--: good move, that
08:54:16 <Marvin--> I'm glad you keep telling me that ;)
08:54:39 <dark> I'm not letting my personal info anywhere *near* yahoo :)
08:54:43 <mgoetze> well, i have to try for a second group now, as the first one is totally contained
08:54:51 <mgoetze> dark: so, give 'em fake info ;)
08:54:59 <Marvin--> dark: what makes you think I filled in personal info? :) Q: "What's your pet's name?", A: "Haskell"
08:55:03 <dark> mgoetze: No, that just encourages them.
08:55:16 <mgoetze> dark: but really, i've had my yahoo id for like 5 years now, and it hasn't given me any hassles
08:55:40 <dark> mgoetze: Well I think they're a bunch of evil fucks for silently replacing words in their user's emails.
08:55:48 <dark> excusez le mot.
08:56:08 * mgoetze is off of yahoo email now.
08:57:27 <dark> mgoetze: I'm never very selective in my identifications of evil :)  I totally avoid the whole site now.
08:57:49 <mgoetze> dark: pah... fine, don't play with us :P
08:58:12 <mgoetze> anyone want a haskell-go mailing list, seeing as i recently set up mailman?
08:58:16 <Marvin--> rofl
08:58:34 <dark> Go player written in Haskell?
08:58:47 <mgoetze> well, that would be nice too ;)
09:01:01 <mgoetze> i think i'm in the 'start bluffing' phase now... lol
09:01:02 <Marvin--> oh wait, some stuff's coming back to me, forming those O:s are good, right? ;)
09:01:13 <mgoetze> yeah, Os are nice
09:02:57 <dark> mgoetze: I think you forgot a key element of "bluffing" :)
09:03:24 <mgoetze> dark: oh, oops ;)
09:03:49 <dark> I remember using psychological tricks in face-to-face games :)
09:03:57 <mgoetze> Marvin--: note that you can't immediately re-set the stone i just took; this is called a "ko"
09:04:15 <Marvin--> mgoetze: yeah, I remember that (well, not the name of it)
09:04:19 <dark> Unsupportable moves should be played as the capstone of a sequence of unhurried (but relatively fast) moves, while leaning back in the chair.
09:04:33 <mgoetze> hehe
09:04:49 <dark> At the earliest opportunity after such a move, play somewhere completely different in a complicated situation.
09:05:29 <dark> It doesn't work against good players, of course, but that's not the point :-)
09:05:32 * Marvin-- SO has no idea what he's doing
09:06:00 <mgoetze> Marvin--: saving your upper left group i'm afraid :(
09:06:07 <Marvin--> maybe I should go for instant gratification
09:06:24 <mgoetze> Marvin--: note that i'm not allowed to set at point a8 or b9 now; those points are called "eyes"
09:07:46 <mgoetze> Marvin--: don't put too many stones in territory you already own, it just denies you pointes. when you think the game is over, click on "pass"
09:07:57 <Marvin--> uh
09:07:59 <Marvin--> oookay
09:09:02 <Marvin--> since I don't remember how to count the score *shrugs*
09:09:21 <dark> Marvin: There are several ways to count the score :)
09:09:25 <mgoetze> Marvin--: note that i just ignored your last move - that's called "tenuki"
09:09:29 <Marvin--> huh
09:09:30 <dark> It's one of the poorly-defined parts of Go.
09:09:45 <mgoetze> (in japanese scoring, i get a point for that stone you just dumped in my territory)
09:09:50 <Marvin--> oh
09:10:07 <Marvin--> mgoetze: well, I can't very well put another stone in that area anyway, because then you'd steal both of them
09:10:14 <Marvin--> which is why, I guess, you get a point for it ;)
09:10:18 <dark> http://www.britgo.org/rules/compare.html
09:10:21 <mgoetze> Marvin--: yeah, that's the point
09:10:36 <Marvin--> but I don't see how I can steal more stones for you
09:10:43 <Marvin--> err, s/for/from/
09:10:48 <mgoetze> Marvin--: note that the group at the upper-right is definitely alive, it has eyespace at g7-9 and j8-9
09:10:57 <mgoetze> Marvin--: the game is over, you can pass now
09:11:04 <Marvin--> oh
09:11:07 <Marvin--> right ;)
09:11:20 * mgoetze wins by 2 :)
09:11:44 <Marvin--> huh, what am I supposed to do now?
09:11:56 <mgoetze> Marvin--: is it asking you to click on dead stones? if so, it's just the last black stone you put in. then click done
09:12:15 <Marvin--> err
09:12:28 <mgoetze> Marvin--: hm... did you just click done?
09:12:43 <Marvin--> I thought I should click on that black stone first?
09:12:47 <Marvin--> I'm pretty sure I did
09:12:59 <mgoetze> oh, probably it showed you my suggestion, and you clicked on it to make it live again
09:13:06 <Marvin--> er
09:13:09 <Marvin--> oh
09:13:09 <mgoetze> Marvin--: pass
09:13:18 <Marvin--> I can't pass
09:13:29 <Marvin--> I guess I have to place a stone first
09:13:55 <mgoetze> ah, who cares, i already counted it anyhow
09:14:16 <Marvin--> so I should just click Done now?
09:14:19 <mgoetze> yeah
09:14:37 <mgoetze> 10 komi for me? har har, yeah right
09:14:46 <mgoetze> the score should be 20-18 for me
09:14:47 <Marvin--> huh?
09:14:50 <mgoetze> want another?
09:14:55 <Marvin--> sure
09:15:05 <mgoetze> want 5 again or should we try 4?
09:15:16 <Marvin--> 5 didn't help much ;)
09:15:35 <mgoetze> Marvin--: sure it did, you wouldn't have any living groups on the board with 3 or less ;)
09:15:56 <esap> which server are you playing? IGS? :-)
09:16:04 <mgoetze> esap: yahoo
09:16:07 * mgoetze will brb
09:16:11 <esap> oh :-)
09:16:20 * esap recommends IGS.
09:16:43 <dark> esap: They want a graphical client and they don't like cgoban for some reason :)
09:16:53 <dark> There's still the Kiseido server, though -- http://kgs.kiseido.com/
09:16:59 <dark> It also has java applets.
09:17:02 * esap uses xgospel.
09:18:13 <mgoetze> dark: my only problem with cgoban is that it's not installed and i'm not root
09:19:17 <Marvin--> man, now I'm not thinking
09:19:31 * Marvin-- is hungry
09:19:35 <shapr> me too
09:20:39 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: you should invite me to watch your game :)
09:20:50 <Marvin--> no, this is silly, I can't think straight
09:21:26 <Marvin--> I've already given you way too much
09:21:48 <mgoetze> Marvin--: that's not much at all... look how much you have (yet)
09:21:58 <Marvin--> I do?
09:22:04 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: you're black? You can take all his pieces!
09:22:16 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: he can't
09:22:22 * mgoetze has two eyes
09:22:31 <SyntaxPolice> ahwell :)
09:22:39 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: h6 and j5 ;)
09:22:58 <Marvin--> I'm still lost
09:23:38 <mgoetze> Marvin--: b2 or b8 would probably guarantee you a win
09:23:56 <Marvin--> uh
09:24:18 <Marvin--> I guess that's something you learn by playing a lot, it doesn't tell me anything
09:24:43 <mgoetze> Marvin--: well, if you place one of those, it becomes basically impossible for me to get that corner
09:25:01 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: see those diagnal pieces ou have in the upper right?  Thats something you have to be careful about.
09:25:08 <SyntaxPolice> theyr'e not connected, so you have to give them some support.
09:25:20 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: oh shaddup ;)
09:25:26 <SyntaxPolice> oh sorry.
09:25:33 <SyntaxPolice> thought it was more of a teaching game. 
09:25:38 * SyntaxPolice will shut up
09:26:05 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: well it is, lol
09:26:16 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: i just don't want to be decimated completely ;)
09:26:18 <dark> SyntaxPolice: The teacher still has to _win_ the teaching game, it's tradition :)
09:26:42 <SyntaxPolice> fair enough :)
09:26:54 <Marvin--> no, this is silly, everybody's giving me advice, but since I don't understand he advice there's no point to it
09:26:56 <SyntaxPolice> again, my most humble apologies :)
09:27:16 <mgoetze> Marvin--: i'll give you some advice: "just play"... that's a good way to learn
09:27:43 <Marvin--> mgoetze: which is what I tried to do, but now this game is ruined thanks to people (you included) telling me how to win
09:28:00 <mgoetze> Marvin--: hm... if you say so
09:28:10 <Marvin--> and I'm hungry anyway
09:28:24 <mgoetze> Marvin--: you could always just disregard the advice so that you find out why it was given ;)
09:28:41 <Marvin--> no, never mind, it's not the same
09:28:42 <dark> Marvin: The main thing is to play lots of games, that's why 9x9 is a good starting board.
09:29:14 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: you have any sort of rating?
09:30:27 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: no, I don't know what my rating would be.
09:30:41 <dark> "african or european?"
09:30:46 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: we'll have to find out the hard way then ;)
09:30:58 <SyntaxPolice> how 'bout a 13x13? kinda quick one?
09:31:11 <mgoetze> ok
09:31:12 <mgoetze> creating
09:31:15 <SyntaxPolice> beat ya
09:31:32 <mgoetze> damn
09:31:46 <SyntaxPolice> hehe. we need a semiphore or sometjhing
09:31:46 <Marvin--> that was *really* quick ;)
09:32:05 <Marvin--> I didn't realize the game was that quick in the hands of experts *g*
09:32:11 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: ok, have a seat
09:32:14 <mgoetze> Marvin--: :P
09:32:17 * SyntaxPolice looks for the sit button
09:32:26 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: top right
09:32:44 * mgoetze nabs a corner
09:32:51 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: very silly UI, isn't it?
09:32:58 <SyntaxPolice> yeah, its akward
09:33:01 <SyntaxPolice> buttons everywhere.
09:34:53 * SyntaxPolice wondersif he shoudlb e more agressive
09:34:59 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: naaah
09:35:16 <mgoetze> ooh, lotsa nice cuts here...
09:35:26 <SyntaxPolice> yeah choices choices
09:35:33 * mgoetze picks one
09:35:43 <dark> no... NOT THAT ONE!
09:36:03 <mgoetze> dark: yes, i know where your sympathies are... no need to remind me ;)
09:40:03 <Marvin--> you know, "make this move and you'll win" is probably one of the worst things you can say, because... if you make the move, sure you'll win but no thanks to anything you did yourself, and if you don't make the move, you'll probably lose
09:40:32 <mgoetze> Marvin--: well, i did say "make this move and you'll win because..."
09:40:52 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: keep trying ;)
09:41:08 <SyntaxPolice> yeahyeah, I'm a deeper thinker than this :)
09:42:13 <SyntaxPolice> we'll play again :)
09:42:17 <mgoetze> well, that was a quick game, lol
09:42:29 <SyntaxPolice> it had to be.
09:42:33 <SyntaxPolice> gotta go.
09:42:38 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: cya later
09:42:58 <SyntaxPolice> I shouldn't be playing games at work when the boss, manager, and me all work in the same office :-)
09:43:11 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: lol, no, i suppose not
09:43:16 <SyntaxPolice> also playing online makes me really nervious... not sure why... but enough excuses. i'll whoop on you next time.
09:43:34 <mgoetze> yeah... sure :)
09:43:43 <mgoetze> (because next time i'll let you have black)
09:43:48 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
09:43:49 * SyntaxPolice lunch &
10:06:35 * mgoetze hates maple for being so good.
10:07:34 <esap> is maple really that good?
10:08:29 <mgoetze> esap: yeah, it figures out limits nearly instantaneously which still look like 0/0 to me after 3 applications of l'hospital ;)
10:08:42 <esap> heh
10:09:03 <mgoetze> esap: 1/(sin(x)^2) - 1/x^2, x->0
10:31:45 <shapr> andersca: hey, you wrote gconf-editor ?
10:31:51 <andersca> yes
10:31:54 <shapr> spiffy :-)
10:32:04 <radix> yay, gconf-editor helped me unb0rk galeon-snapshot
10:32:14 <shapr> yah, I'm about to use it to unb0rk gnome-terminal
10:32:18 <radix> :D
10:32:21 <shapr> thanks for writing it andersca 
10:33:00 <shapr> the bookmark feature is especially spiffy
10:33:32 <andersca> cool :)
10:33:45 <andersca> I have some plans for it
10:33:49 <andersca> but they require gconf changes
10:42:38 <shapr> interesting discussion on comp.lang.functional .. metaprogramming and C++ templates
10:42:49 <Heffalump> Igloo should read that, then
10:43:13 <Igloo> Ah, hmmm, yes
10:43:16 <Heffalump> oh, no actually, it's not that interesting
10:43:22 <Heffalump> just about what people expect from a compiler
10:43:24 <Igloo> Ah, good oh
10:43:24 <esap> is it about the sizeof trick or something :-)
10:43:27 <Heffalump> very little UI
10:44:22 <shapr> the part I find interesting is that some people have decided against lazy-by-default languages because "they are too unpredictable"
10:44:31 <shapr> joachim durcholz said something like that
10:45:05 <esap> I think the problem is more like people have not gained understanding of the performance characteristics of lazy languages.
10:45:18 <shapr> he seems to say that lazy language programmers need to understand the optimizations happening in the compiler to know how to write decent code
10:45:23 <esap> For C++ people, predictable performance is the most important thing.
10:46:41 <Segora> shapr: btw. the IrcMonad is slowly getting into shape
10:47:13 <esap> I think for people with mainly experience in strict languages, it is quite a big conceptual leap to understand how lazy evaluation works. It really requires a new way of thinking for being able to use it efficiently.
10:48:54 <Heffalump> but the performance of compiled code /is/ unpredictable
10:49:10 <Segora> shapr: had a few minutes time today, now you can at least do this: withServer "localhost" 1234 ((do send "Hi, who's there?\n"; delay 5000000; recv) >>= putStrLn) ;)
10:49:15 <Heffalump> (with GHC, anyway)
10:49:19 <esap> In particular, many C++ people have the basic idea that performance optimization happens by controlling the evaluation order of different things.
10:49:49 <esap> ... which allows them to minimize the things evaluated.
10:49:54 <Segora> ah wrong parentheses
10:50:37 <Segora> of course, I meant: (withServer "localhost" 1234 (do send "Hi, who's there?\n"; delay 5000000; recv)) >>= putStrLn
10:50:41 <Segora> silly me
10:50:51 <esap> In lazy languages, you have to do exactly opposite: arrange that things that should not be evaluated will be evaluated after the program has finished running :-)
10:52:22 <Heffalump> but also the performance overhead you get from having laziness /everywhere/ hurts
10:53:02 <esap> Well I guess optimizing that should be the job for the compiler.
10:54:51 <Heffalump> yes, and even the best compiler we have doesn't do a great job
10:55:05 <Heffalump> and you need an understanding of what it'll do to know what'll be efficient, which is really hard
10:55:53 <esap> well, I'd say it's not that hard, it's just the opposite of strict evaluation. I think both approaches have similar characteristics.
10:57:17 <Heffalump> but strict evaluation is fundamentally more efficient - no thunks
10:58:06 <esap> Strict evaluation has to evaluate unnecessary expressions.
10:58:25 <Heffalump> sorry, fundamentally more efficient on things that actually need to be evaluated
10:58:57 <radix> hrr hrr
11:01:10 <esap> Well, I'm not even sure about that. I mean, I guess it's possible to write a compiler that doesn't build those thunks too often. I think general recursion is the only situation where thunks are really necessary.
11:02:11 <Heffalump> either you sometimes evaluate things unnecessarily, or you need a very good strictness analyser
11:02:22 <Heffalump> and no strictness analyser can spot /everything/
11:03:04 <esap> Would it just be sufficient to start evaluating from the outermost expression always. And have your data structures optimized for that situation.
11:03:57 <Heffalump> that's what lazy evaluation does
11:04:13 <esap> heh
11:05:04 <esap> You're right, but I mean the compiler must group code in the reverse order that it occurs in the source code [I think not many compilers actually do this].
11:05:21 * esap doesn't actually know about ghc :-)
11:08:49 <esap> ghc seems to generate unconditional jumps based on data in a closure.
11:41:22 <mgoetze> so, i've registered on nngs! anyone wanna play?
11:41:47 <emu> how many people are on nngs
11:42:13 <mgoetze> if i'm doing this right, about 25
11:42:21 <emu> heh
11:42:39 <emu> I totally forgot nngs existed
11:42:46 <Marvin--> what's nngs?
11:42:51 <mgoetze> no name go server
11:43:00 <Marvin--> heh
11:43:01 <mgoetze> Marvin--: just start cgoban and click on nngs
11:43:13 <Marvin--> not now :)
11:43:22 * Marvin-- is watching handball
11:43:30 * emu has to go to class
11:43:32 <mgoetze> Marvin--: national or international?
11:44:09 <Marvin--> Sweden - France
11:44:18 <Marvin--> 18-23 right now *mutter*
11:44:33 * mgoetze doesn't follow handball...
11:51:39 <Marvin--> sports is interesting, when the national team wins it's "we" but if they lose it's "they" ;)
11:52:13 * mgoetze watches gnugo play on nngs
11:54:58 * mgoetze wonders how the guy whose ass is being kicked by gnu go got to 6 kyu
11:57:12 <mgoetze> oh, i see, he's playing with more handicap than he ought to be...
12:02:27 <Marvin--> heh
12:03:14 <mgoetze> cool, i can watch old pro games on nngs
12:12:26 <Marvin--> hrrm, how do I unpack a src rpm anyway
12:12:56 <andersca> rpm -ivh it
12:13:16 <Marvin--> ...if you say so ;)
12:13:56 <Marvin--> argh, okay, let me rephrase that. How do I unpack it to a given directory instead of /usr/src/rpm?
12:15:16 <Marvin--> wonder if it'd be easier to use alien
12:15:27 * Janni is back...
12:15:32 <andersca> you can use rpm2cpio and cpio
12:16:17 <Marvin--> ugh, great
12:16:21 <Marvin--> alien -g was easier ;)
12:18:27 <mgoetze> Janni: willste go spielen? ;)
12:22:40 <emu> still trying to go?
12:55:47 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: I shouldn't have told you about yahoo go :)
12:56:19 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: it's ok, i didn't have cgoban up at the time
12:56:40 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: now come to nngs :)
12:59:11 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: no go at work, at least not until I'm alone here... we have a go board and a chess board sitting on the table, and we make moves a few times a day...
12:59:30 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: how long have you been playing?
13:00:23 <SyntaxPolice> I do really want to play more often... I've taught so many people to play, but seldom get to play against people at my level, so I should play more online.
13:00:37 <SyntaxPolice> because I can't learn otherwise.
13:02:12 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: early november or so
13:04:40 * mgoetze considers starting up some #haskell internal rankings :)
13:05:48 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: don't rank me until we play a longer game :-)
13:05:55 <mgoetze> hehe
13:06:47 <SyntaxPolice> so I got gtk2hs to work on Debian unstable, now can anyone give me a quick overview between htk and franTK?
13:15:12 <emu> do you need to register to play?
13:16:06 <mgoetze> emu: on nngs? no
13:16:11 <mgoetze> emu: on yahoo, yes
13:35:38 <SyntaxPolice> is franTK the only declarative GUI library?
13:47:06 <Marvin--> heh, amusing when a commercial is a parody on another
15:48:03 <argv[0]> by a chance.. is there anyone here that is studying at Utrech University?
15:49:41 <argv[0]> guess not
15:49:44 <argv[0]> gotta run, bye all
17:04:21 <kawfee> det: yo
18:58:39 <steele> hi
21:56:12 <det> kawfee: hey, I noticed you said something earlier
21:57:46 <kawfee> yeah
21:57:59 <kawfee> not too long ago in the logs
21:58:38 <det> what's up
21:58:41 <det> hrmm
