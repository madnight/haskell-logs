03:36:53 <Igloo> shapr: Ta, I'll take a look (although I thought it should happen automagically)
03:47:25 <xkb> Hi, say I want to define a operational semantics for a "random assignment" x:=?, where ? is some automatic generated random number. How would this affect reduction rules?
03:47:55 <xkb> Normally you have some state
03:48:08 <xkb> with variables and associated values
03:48:23 <xkb> x |-> 3 etc
03:48:46 <xkb> This is a question from an exam, and Im not sure how to handle this.
03:53:54 <xkb> I could add ? to the domain perhaps
04:04:37 <Heffalump> that's probably simplest
05:22:44 * Igloo realises we just passed the half way point
05:38:56 <jlouis> xkb: either they are pseudo-random and you could get them from the current state. Or they are truly random in which I would extend the domain..
05:41:21 <jlouis> Igloo: how is it going?
06:07:46 <Igloo> jlouis: I think we're having issues ATM, but I'm not involved in the current driver bottleneck
06:18:04 <jlouis> Igloo: ok ;)
06:30:13 * cale wakes up.
06:56:52 <Igloo> Before I makea  complete fool of myself, can someone confirm that it's possible to go from bottom right to top left in
06:56:54 <Igloo> g.
06:56:57 <Igloo> please?
06:56:59 <Igloo> .g
07:00:27 <Heffalump> in what?
07:02:30 <Riastradh> The ICFP contest?
07:03:06 <Heffalump> IM what is "g. .g"?
07:03:19 <Igloo> Too late now anyway  :-)
07:03:24 <Igloo> green and track are g and . respectively
07:10:14 <ddarius_> Actually, I see what the problem is now.
07:10:49 <jlouis> you mean go diagonal in
07:10:50 <jlouis> .g
07:10:52 <jlouis> g.
07:10:52 <jlouis> ?
07:11:06 <jlouis> Could be fun :)\
07:20:28 <Igloo> Yeah
07:20:53 <cale> I'm not actually doing the contest, but I read the description, and I think you can do that so long as your car never actually lands in one of the g's at any timestep. You should also be able to power through corners like this.
07:21:10 <Igloo> Cool, ta
07:21:21 <Igloo> (and why not? Shame on you  :-)  )
07:26:45 <jlouis> I am not in either. Have a report due tomorrow
07:26:52 <jlouis> and then I need to code some Haskell
07:28:08 <Riastradh> The #scheme team collectively laughs at the #haskell team's feeble attempt at the contest!
07:30:18 <cale> I suppose we'll end up with a fixpt library for Haskell at the end of it though :)
07:36:02 <Igloo> Riastradh: You might want to wait until they wake up  :-)
07:36:22 <Riastradh> Until the #haskell team wakes up?
07:36:37 <Igloo> Yup
07:37:44 <Riastradh> Lazy slackers!
07:37:57 <Riastradh> The #scheme team collectively says 'lazy slackers!' to the sleeping #haskell team.
08:17:24 <jlouis> Riastradh: hehe
08:32:06 * cale plays space quest 0
08:53:15 * shapr boings
08:54:49 <Igloo> How goes, shapr?
08:56:11 <shapr> I'm awake!
08:56:12 <shapr> that's good!
09:00:22 <Igloo> :-)
09:04:51 * Arnia builds a trampoline function in the middle of the room
09:05:17 * Riastradh bounces.
09:05:27 * shapr bounces too
09:05:40 * Riastradh hogs the trampoline.
09:05:49 <Arnia> Hey shapr :)
09:05:53 <shapr> hi Arnia
09:06:32 * shapr runs the trampoline function with +RTS -m512M
09:07:10 * shapr boings in a far corner of the trampoline
09:08:02 * Arnia changes the coefficient of restitution on the springs
09:08:07 * Riastradh drags the trampoline to #scheme and then puts up sandbags and other assorted barriers between #scheme and #haskell so the #haskell team can't use it.
09:09:00 <vegai> east/west germany <=> #scheme/#haskell
09:09:12 * vegai digs a pothole and jumps in.
09:09:18 <Riastradh> But most people here are Swedes, not Germans.
09:09:20 * shapr squishes the sandbags into nice couch forms and relaxes after good exercise
09:09:23 * Arnia distorts the data structures of the trampoline and locks them in a monad
09:09:38 * Riastradh throws a spear at shapr.
09:10:14 <shapr> ack, the spear was so scary I dropped part of my banana into my coffee
09:10:41 <shapr> hm, interesting taste
09:11:09 * Arnia builds a large tank out of neutronium
09:11:26 * Riastradh throws assorted neutrinos at that tank.
09:11:38 * Arnia tank begins to warm up
09:11:48 <Arnia> That was strange...
09:12:00 * Riastradh shoots shapr with a neutrino gun.
09:12:12 * shapr becomes neutral
09:12:17 <Arnia> Most ineffectual weapon ever... :)
09:12:49 * shapr is unable to energize himself
09:14:31 * Arnia finds a torroid of plutonium
09:14:43 * Riastradh shoots an arrow through Arnia.
09:15:07 <shapr> do you think a plutonic relationship is the opposite of a platonic relationship?
09:15:11 * Arnia uses a torsion field to become 2D in this space
09:17:24 * shapr uses a thorsson field to practice for Ragnarok
09:17:48 * Riastradh wants to know what ever happened to Ragnarok -- the screenshots of it looked really cool.
09:17:52 * Arnia uses a poison field to kills some rats
09:18:14 <shapr> what was ragnarok?
09:18:41 <Riastradh> It was an Ambrosia game, but it was cancelled because Ben Spees (or whatever his name was) quit.
09:19:01 <shapr> oh
09:19:30 <shapr> one day programmers will be like rockstars
09:19:44 <vegai> full of dope and other sh*t?
09:19:56 <Riastradh> What about rock stars who are programmers?
09:20:03 <Riastradh> Who are already programmers, that is.
09:20:16 <shapr> I was thinking more about a band-sized group of programmers writing new games and making lots of money off of them
09:20:17 <Arnia> What about failed rockstars?
09:20:32 <vegai> and live performances!
09:20:42 <shapr> yes, live programming performances
09:20:45 <shapr> that would be spiffy
09:21:15 <shapr> how do I stuff settings from a localpackage.conf in this dir into ghc-pkg ?
09:26:06 <shapr> I'll just use emacs
09:26:11 <shapr> yay, it worked
09:48:18 <cl1dev|study> howdy folks
09:48:22 <shapr> hiya
09:48:26 <shapr> how's TX?
09:48:31 <cl1dev> hot
09:48:47 <shapr> any code?
09:49:05 <cl1dev> how do you know i'm from texas?
09:49:16 <shapr> your hostname
09:49:21 <cl1dev> ah
09:49:25 <shapr> cl1dev@c66.190.75.12.ts46v-13.otn-g1.ftwrth.tx.charter.com
09:49:32 <shapr> I can even guess the city
09:49:41 <shapr> amazing mental powers, yah?
09:50:04 <cl1dev> i'm wanting to know if functions like filter and map in haskell are like the standard lib in C where they are part of the language
09:50:12 <shapr> yup
09:50:19 <shapr> lots of functions like that
09:50:27 <cl1dev> shapr: well i hang out on a lot of channels, so i didn't know if you knew from one of those or not
09:50:32 <shapr> if you have Hugs installed, you'll have a file called Prelude.hs
09:50:42 <cl1dev> shapr: cool, thanks
09:50:45 <shapr> the Prelude is the standard library for Haskell 98
09:51:07 <cale> a major part of it, anyways
09:51:25 <cl1dev> functional programming is pretty cool
09:51:35 <shapr> truly
09:51:40 <cale> yeah, it is :)
09:51:46 <cl1dev> i still like javascript the best tho
09:51:57 <cl1dev> but i'm just starting out with functional programming so this may change
09:52:06 <Smerdyakov> LOL
09:52:11 <Smerdyakov> I should HOPE that would change.
09:52:49 <cl1dev> yeah, i know i'm a weirdo for liking javascript
09:53:03 <shapr> I like the prototypical part of javascript
09:53:20 <shapr> the ability to quickly change the behaviour of the entire system by replacing methods on the root instance
09:53:37 <jlouis> shapr: manipulate Prelude.hs :)
09:53:44 <cl1dev> yeah, that's one of the reasons i like javascript so much
09:53:52 <shapr> @prelude map
09:53:54 <lambdabot> *** "map" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
09:53:54 <lambdabot> map
09:53:54 <lambdabot>   map ::  (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
09:53:54 <lambdabot>   map f xs          = [ f x | x <- xs ]
09:54:13 <cl1dev> what are -> and <- ?
09:54:43 <shapr> \x -> x + 1
09:54:47 * cl1dev sees -> and thinks P -> Q (if P then Q)
09:54:58 <shapr> that's an anonymous function that adds one to x
09:55:16 <cale> In the context of a type, a -> b meansa function from a's to b's.
09:55:34 * cl1dev doesn't know what a meansa is
09:55:40 <shapr> means a
09:55:43 <cale> s/meansa/means a/
09:55:44 * vegai rolls his eyes.
09:55:47 <cl1dev> LOL
09:55:49 <cl1dev> oh
09:55:53 <shapr> add :: Int -> Int -> Int
09:55:57 <shapr> add x y = x + y
09:56:04 <shapr> the first line is the type signature
09:56:11 <cl1dev> oh, ok
09:56:21 <shapr> the second line is the actual code of the function
09:56:27 <cl1dev> now i know what those error messages mean
09:56:30 <shapr> type signatures are optional 99% of the time
09:56:44 <shapr> because Haskell uses type inferencing
09:56:51 <jlouis> [ f x | x <- xs ] = apply f on x, where x's are drawn from the list xs
09:57:23 <jlouis> returning a new list.. so: map f [x1,...,xn] = [f x1, ..., f xn]
09:57:33 <cl1dev> so that's the same as f(x) for all x in xs ?
09:57:51 <cl1dev> oh, i get it
09:57:52 <jlouis> yes
09:58:19 <cl1dev> i'm so tired, must stay awake!
09:58:49 * cl1dev is waiting for his wife to call from army basic training
09:59:36 <vegai> ;-P
10:00:53 <cl1dev> learning haskell whilst trying not to nod off at the keyboard is proving to be a more difficult task as time goes by
10:05:38 <vegai> may I inquire why your wife wanted to join the army?
10:07:02 <cl1dev> i dunno why, she just wanted to
10:07:48 <Smerdyakov> USA army?
10:07:58 <cl1dev> Smerdyakov: yup
10:08:09 <Smerdyakov> I don't know why anyone sane would want to join THAT.
10:08:22 <cl1dev> Smerdyakov: why not?
10:08:38 <vegai> I agree
10:08:45 <vegai> but not my business
10:09:25 <shapr> I think it makes a lot of sense if you regard your country as an extension of your family for example
10:09:25 <Smerdyakov> cl1dev, possibly getting killed to serve the interests of the rich and powerful..
10:09:36 <shapr> in that case you're taking an active role in defending your extended family
10:09:53 <vegai> except that US doesn't so much defend as attack
10:10:02 <vegai> oops, I didn't say that
10:10:08 <shapr> depends on how you look at it though
10:10:15 <shapr> as with everything else
10:10:17 <vegai> it defends actively
10:10:20 <Arnia> I have too many family members in too many countries to view nationality as anything more than an expression of tribal rivalry :)
10:10:27 <cl1dev> vegai: that's beacause we've only been attacked twice ever
10:10:42 <shapr> before this gets out of hand...
10:11:01 <shapr> I'll just say I find it understandable that some people would want to join the armed forces
10:11:11 <shapr> but that I personally would not do well in that structure.
10:11:23 <Smerdyakov> shapr, understandable how?
10:11:28 <shapr> just as I said
10:11:32 <vegai> I only understand it in an elitist way ;-/
10:11:38 <cl1dev> i would be a spy if i could get into the military, that would be way cool
10:11:41 <shapr> assume country = family/tribe/etc
10:11:55 <shapr> assume wish to take an active role in defending family/tribe/etc
10:12:01 <shapr> solution: join the armed forces
10:12:11 <cl1dev> shapr: that pretty much sums up my wife's veiw on the matter
10:12:16 <Smerdyakov> cl1dev, why would it be cool? Did you ever think about what spies do?
10:12:18 <vegai> shapr: yes, that's what I meant as well
10:12:38 <Smerdyakov> shapr, of course, country = family/tribe/etc doesn't work in the context of how the USA armed forces are used.
10:12:41 <cl1dev> Smerdyakov: yeah, i know what spies do
10:12:58 <shapr> Smerdyakov: that is your viewpoint, but not everyone's viewpoint
10:13:03 <cl1dev> Smerdyakov: do you live in the USA?
10:13:11 <Smerdyakov> shapr, how about your defend that "viewpoint" objectively?
10:13:14 <Smerdyakov> s/your/you
10:13:15 <Smerdyakov> cl1dev, yes.
10:13:25 <shapr> Smerdyakov: I didn't even say it's my viewpoint, just that some people do hold it.
10:13:30 * Arnia is scared and hides behind the trampoline
10:13:31 <shapr> plus I'm busy coding :-P
10:13:40 <Smerdyakov> shapr, I don't accept the right of anyone to hold a viewpoint without justifying it.
10:13:59 <shapr> everyone holds their own viewpoint anyway
10:14:06 <shapr> no matter the justification or not
10:14:09 * cl1dev believes he doesn't have to justify hisself to anyone
10:14:27 <Arnia> Even if someone justifies it, you may not like the justification
10:14:29 <shapr> you don't have to accept it, it just is that way.
10:14:29 <Smerdyakov> cl1dev, you don't have to, but then varous anyones are free to write you off as an irrational kook. :)
10:14:49 <Heffalump> a simple justification is "my enemies are evil, my friends are good, I want to defend my friends against my enemies".
10:15:05 <cl1dev> Smerdyakov: then so be it
10:15:08 <Smerdyakov> Heffalump, but that pretty much never holds in reality.
10:15:10 <vegai> unfortunately, that would justify everything
10:15:19 <Riastradh> Heffalump, especially not in the US.
10:15:23 <Heffalump> depends how you define evil and good
10:15:29 <vegai> Heffalump: exactly
10:15:29 <shapr> if you want to justify something enough to do it, you usually can
10:15:31 <Heffalump> and that tends to be entirely subjective
10:15:47 <shapr> for any definition of something and enough
10:15:58 <Heffalump> I'd happily (on moral grounds) join the British army. 
10:16:24 <cl1dev> back at the ranch .. "What's that lassie?" "BARK BARK" "Timmy is stuck in a well?" ...
10:16:25 <vegai> sheesh, you guys have the choice
10:16:28 <shapr> I think I'd be a detriment to any armed forces.
10:16:32 <shapr> cl1dev: hahah!
10:16:47 <Smerdyakov> Heffalump, why?
10:16:53 <Arnia> I can never join, nor be called up. They'd need a field hospital to keep me going :)
10:17:14 <shapr> so, the conclusion here is that some of us can understand why others would join the armed forces.
10:17:21 <cl1dev> i can't join either, i'm diabetic
10:17:24 <shapr> thank you, and good night everybody. next show in the morning :-P
10:17:43 <shapr> actually the Coast Guard wouldn't let me in because I take prescription medication.
10:17:52 <shapr> even though they desperately wanted my computer skills
10:17:52 <Heffalump> because they defend things that are important to me
10:18:01 <Arnia> Diabetic, epilepsy, RSD, asthma... ;)
10:18:08 <shapr> what's RSD?
10:18:30 <cl1dev> RDS == remebering stuff difciency?
10:18:33 <shapr> heh
10:18:34 <Arnia> Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy... the autonomic nervous system in my legs has wasted away
10:18:38 <Smerdyakov> Heffalump, they also seem to serve imperialist interests.
10:18:40 <shapr> oh, that sucks
10:18:42 <cl1dev> ohh
10:18:47 <shapr> Arnia: does that mean you use a wheelchair?
10:18:51 <cl1dev> Arnia: at least you can still write code :)
10:19:06 <vegai> if you want some challenge, join the Iraqi army
10:19:09 <shapr> or just that rubber hammers don't work on your knees?
10:19:28 <Arnia> Sometimes... but only cos of pain... its like phantom limb pain combined with cramps
10:19:31 <shapr> yow
10:20:39 <shapr> I've heard phantom limb pain is worse than normal limb pain, what do you think?
10:20:50 <Arnia> I'm still good at what I enjoy most, so I don't let it get to me.
10:20:58 <Heffalump> even if I accepted that invading Iraq was in pursuit of imperialist interests, I still think the British army does/has done enough good things to outweight that
10:21:01 <Heffalump> (and I don't accept it)
10:21:25 <shapr> Arnia: yah, code is a great thing
10:21:32 <shapr> er, I assume you're talking about code :-)
10:21:56 <Arnia> Code, graphic design, research (FP and AI), code design... all fun :)
10:22:30 * cl1dev is trying to learn NLP stuff
10:22:48 <cl1dev> i wanna kick it star trek style with my computer
10:22:49 <shapr> natural language parsing?
10:22:54 <shapr> neurolinguistic programming?
10:23:05 <cl1dev> shapr: natural langauge processing
10:23:17 <shapr> wouldn't it be easier to use lojban as a starting point?
10:23:23 <Arnia> Don't bother with statstical NLP... its kind of like throwing darts at a dictionary
10:23:37 <shapr> lawn darts? :-)
10:23:42 <Arnia> Lojban is nothing like a real language.
10:23:47 <shapr> that's true
10:23:52 <shapr> that does make it easier to parse though
10:24:14 <Arnia> Real languages use the concept of paths... lojban doesn't and as such has no reuse and a fragile syntax
10:24:37 <shapr> I'd like to read about paths, can you give me some urls?
10:24:54 <Arnia> Conception in the brain is a matter of tokens and paths.
10:24:56 <shapr> lojban does have reuse of concepts as both nouns and verbs
10:25:10 <Arnia> See the wide variety of books by Ray Jackendoff for details
10:25:18 <shapr> the syntax seems relatively flexible to me, but that's from the perspective of programming languages
10:25:22 <shapr> ok, thanks
10:25:28 <Arnia> shapr: That isn't a natural division in the brain...
10:25:33 <Smerdyakov> OMG... Ray Jackendoff is one letter away from having an incurably humorous surname.
10:25:35 <shapr> I agree
10:25:46 <cl1dev> (i'll bet that author got picked on in school)
10:25:50 <Arnia> Yes... he's also a brilliant scientist and writer
10:26:09 <shapr> my parents almost named me Cornelius
10:26:12 <Arnia> Anyway, I must be off... speak soon
10:26:16 <shapr> I bet I would have been a brilliant scientest then too :-)
10:26:25 <vegai> after Planet of the Apes?
10:26:32 <shapr> nah, after my great grandfather
10:26:36 <vegai> ;D better
10:26:43 <shapr> growing up with the nickname Corny <shudder>
10:26:49 <Riastradh> shapr, of course, you changed your name later anyways.
10:26:54 <shapr> that's true
10:27:04 <shapr> but I grew up with Robert Benjamin Gilliam
10:27:13 <Riastradh> How boring.
10:27:24 <Heffalump> why'd you change it?
10:27:25 <shapr> A boring name is good in middle school
10:27:30 * cl1dev changes his name to zorg
10:27:32 <shapr> I wanted a name that described me.
10:27:39 <Heffalump> in what way does your new name describe you
10:27:40 <Heffalump> ?
10:27:43 <Riastradh> How does 'Shae Erisson' describe you?
10:27:44 <Riastradh> Bah!
10:27:53 <vegai> Heffalump: <shapr> A boring name is good in middle school
10:28:06 <Heffalump> that's not an answer :-)
10:28:08 <shapr> Robert Benjamin Gilliam means something like gift from god, right hand son of the father, and william
10:28:17 <vegai> I thought it was =)
10:28:17 <shapr> Riastradh: you know Eris?
10:28:24 <Riastradh> Of course I do!
10:28:27 <vegai> All hail
10:28:32 <shapr> discordia ;-)
10:28:36 * cl1dev wonders what Charles William Lambert means
10:28:38 * Riastradh throws a golden apple at shapr.
10:28:47 * shapr mus like a chao
10:28:53 <Riastradh> Mus?  Chao?
10:29:01 <shapr> read the principia discordia
10:29:09 <vegai> why is it that everyone here has read those books?
10:29:15 <shapr> we read a lot?
10:29:16 * vegai looks around very suspiciously.
10:29:19 <cl1dev> what books?
10:29:25 * Riastradh hasn't read the Principia Discordia, vegai.
10:29:31 * shapr goes shopping, bbl
10:29:46 <vegai> I don't read a lot ;-/
10:30:41 <cl1dev> i know from my family tree that i'm a direct decendant of charlemagne the ruler of the holy roman empire
10:31:01 * cl1dev wonders who fuct up and how i ended up here
10:31:43 <Riastradh> Considering the number of generations between now and Charlemagne, I don't think that's really significant.
10:33:05 <cl1dev> well my family tree was royalty until about 5 or 6 generations back
10:33:24 * cl1dev doesn't have the tree in front of him to reference exactly
10:37:13 <Heffalump> well, I'm descended from the first ever human being, so there
10:37:56 <opet> really??? me too!
10:38:03 <opet> what a coincidence
10:39:17 <cale> I'm not.
10:39:33 <jlouis> cale: haha
10:39:48 <cale> l
10:39:55 <jlouis> how do you award cale karma for not being human ;)
10:39:58 <Riastradh> I'm descended from a family of prestigious chameleons.
10:40:38 <cale> note to self: the irc client is not a shell.
10:40:57 <Riastradh> You can run a shell from XChat.
10:41:31 <jlouis> Xchat... eeew
10:41:46 <Riastradh> Ewww?
10:42:06 <cl1dev> x-chat is good
10:42:08 <jlouis> I would prefer something else
10:42:11 * cl1dev has version 2.0.1
10:42:16 <cale> I seem to remember that being in older versions, but it seems missing. Anyway, that was just commenting on the fact that I inadvertently typed "l" into the channel.
10:42:33 <cale> X-Chat is decent.
10:42:46 <cl1dev> x-chat can be a shell with the /exec command
10:43:08 <cale> that's true
10:43:21 <andersca> did you know that x-chat used to execute "host <hostname>" when you did a dns lookup?
10:43:38 <andersca> so if you were a malicious irc server you could set your hostname to "foo; rm -rf /"
10:43:39 <andersca> ;M)
10:43:48 <cl1dev> LOL

12:02:50 <shapr> hi syntax-laptop
12:04:18 <syntax-laptop> hi shapr
12:04:36 <shapr> what's up?
12:11:55 <shapr> tmoertel: your twin has left
12:19:12 <syntax-laptop> Not much, I just got back from camping.  Is the contest over? How's it going?
12:19:25 <shapr> it's going along
12:19:29 <shapr> we have code
12:19:47 <syntax-laptop> cool!
12:23:25 <syntax-laptop> someone emailed me with  a 'bug' about using "she" as a generic personal pronoun in the apt-secure docs.  I hope people don't make ab ig deal about that.
12:24:07 <syntax-laptop> hi sha
12:24:08 <Shamino> hi @@ all
12:24:10 <syntax-laptop> shamino
12:24:30 <Shamino> someone wants to help me with an delicious problem ?
12:24:43 <shapr> hi Shamino
12:24:48 <elmex> help... someone is using my domain-name for sending spam messages... *argh*
12:24:54 <Riastradh> A delicious problem?
12:24:57 <Riastradh> What problem might that be?
12:25:06 <Shamino> well its more a beginers problem
12:25:20 <shapr> elmex: same here
12:25:26 <Marvin--> syntax-laptop: I thought the generic personal pronoun in English was "he"?
12:25:39 <Riastradh> Shamino, just state your problem.
12:25:46 <Shamino> ok one moment
12:25:54 <shapr> what really irritates me about new spam sending software is that they send each from a random address on their destination list
12:26:01 <Marvin--> "Please state the nature of..."
12:26:14 <shapr> so I regularly get bounces of spam send from my *OWN* address.
12:27:08 <Shamino> i tried to define a data type to make some special lists like A(B(A(B(A))))
12:27:17 <Shamino> that looks like this
12:27:18 <Shamino> data Sequ = End | A Sequ | B Sequ 
12:27:18 <Shamino> 	  deriving (Show, Eq)
12:27:28 <Shamino> this is fine so far
12:28:22 <Riastradh> No, not quite -- how can you have A as the most nested element? -- it takes a type parametre.
12:28:53 <Shamino> type A = ?
12:29:05 <Shamino> type A = [] ?
12:29:08 <Riastradh> Err.
12:29:12 <Shamino> no i dont think i need that
12:29:13 <Riastradh> Sorry, not a type parametre.
12:29:19 <Riastradh> It's a constructor that takes one argument.
12:29:27 <Riastradh> Oh, never mind.
12:29:32 <Riastradh> Go on!
12:29:42 <Marvin--> Riastradh: what ARE you talking about? :)
12:29:43 <Shamino> yes my problem ist the following
12:29:45 * Riastradh is somewhat frazzled by the heat.
12:29:54 <Shamino> data Sequ = End | A Sequ | B Sequ 
12:29:54 <Shamino> 	  deriving (Show, Eq)
12:29:57 <Shamino> argh no
12:30:08 <Shamino>  Constructor "A" must have exactly 1 argument in pa
12:30:08 <Shamino> ttern                               
12:30:14 <Shamino> so what does that mean ?
12:30:49 <syntax-laptop> Marvin--: it is true that, if there were an official version of english, the generic personal pronoun would be "he".
12:30:53 <Riastradh> Are you using A(B(A(B...))) in pattern matching?
12:31:14 <Shamino> yes
12:31:28 <Shamino> i would use the program like
12:31:42 <Shamino> hsequ A(A(B))) A(B(A))
12:31:55 <Shamino> and the program would compare the two lists
12:31:56 <Riastradh> OK, yes, there the constructor -must- take its argument.
12:32:00 <Riastradh> You would have to do:
12:32:20 <Riastradh> hsequ (A(A(B foo))) (A(B(A foo))) = ...
12:32:24 <Riastradh> ...er...
12:32:39 <Shamino> dont understand that
12:32:42 <Riastradh> s/\.\.\.er\.\.\.//1
12:32:49 <Shamino> uah ?
12:32:53 * Marvin-- boggles at Riastradh
12:33:03 <Riastradh> Ignore the '...er...' -- that's what the s/blah//1 meant.
12:33:04 * Dark-Star grins
12:33:28 <Riastradh> B takes a constructor parametre -- you declared it as data Sequ = ... | B Sequ
12:33:41 <Riastradh> In pattern matching, constructors must be fully 'applied.'
12:34:12 <Shamino> ok wait ill show you my code
12:34:17 <Shamino> makes things easier
12:34:38 <Shamino> hope i dont get kick for spamming
12:34:46 <Shamino> hsequ :: Sequ -> Sequ -> Bool
12:34:46 <Shamino> hsequ End End       = True
12:34:46 <Shamino> hsequ (A:s1) (B:s2) = hsequ (A:s1) s2             
12:34:46 <Shamino> hsequ (B:s1) (A:s2) = hsequ (B:s1) s2 				
12:34:46 <Shamino> hsequ (A:s1) (A:s2) = hsequ s1 s2             
12:34:47 <Shamino> hsequ (B:s1) (B:s2) = hsequ s1 s2
12:34:49 <Shamino> hsequ A (A:s2)      = True       
12:34:51 <Shamino> hsequ B (B:s2)      = True
12:34:53 <Shamino> hsequ (A:s1) A      = False         
12:34:55 <Shamino> hsequ (B:s1) B      = False
12:36:12 <Riastradh> If A were an ordinary function, it would have the type:  Sequ -> Sequ  -- it takes one constructor parametre of type Sequ.  Does this make sense?
12:36:50 <Dark-Star> Shamino: you're intermixing normal lists and your sequences there...
12:37:01 <Shamino> so no () and no : ?
12:39:28 <Dark-Star> Shamino: you should do something like: hsequ (A s1) (B s2) = hsequ (A s1) s2
12:39:48 <Shamino> ok so no " : "
12:40:16 <Dark-Star> because A is a constructor for your sequences, just like ":" is for lists. Only difference is that ":" is an infix-constructor and "A" and "B" are prefix-constructors
12:41:54 <Dark-Star> think of A and B as functions that create your data type, and since they're functions they need a parameter
12:42:12 <Shamino> ok
12:42:48 <Shamino> well now he says the same argh
12:42:50 <Shamino>  Constructor "A" must have exactly 1 argument in pa
12:42:50 <Shamino> ttern                                   
12:43:14 <Shamino> this means no s1 s2 ?
12:44:29 <Dark-Star> no, because you defined your type as "data Sequ = ... | A sequ | ..." which means "if the data has type A it takes exactly one argument"
12:44:55 <Dark-Star> s/sequ/Sequ
12:45:15 <Shamino> argh
12:45:20 <Shamino> i am confused
12:45:26 <Dark-Star> so if you try to match against a pattern like "(A s1 s2)" this makes no sense because that would mean two arguments not one...
12:45:38 <Shamino> ok
12:45:44 <Shamino> so how i get him to take 2 arguments ?
12:46:02 <Dark-Star> change your type definition. But that would make your sequence more like a tree
12:46:23 <Dark-Star> data Sequ = End | A Sequ Sequ | B Sequ Sequ
12:46:40 <Shamino> so ill try that
12:46:48 <Dark-Star> this is essentially a tree (a very simple tree which doesn't story any data)
12:46:57 <Shamino> well thats ok
12:47:14 <Shamino> lol
12:47:18 <Shamino> now he says
12:47:35 <Shamino> Constructor "A" must have exactly 2 arguments in p
12:47:35 <Shamino> attern                            
12:47:56 <Dark-Star> of course, because you just changed your data type to take exactly 2 arguments...
12:48:09 <Dark-Star> maybe you should think again on what you're trying to achieve *g*
12:48:09 <Shamino> now i am even more confused
12:48:23 <Shamino> i wan tto compare two lists
12:48:40 <Shamino> two lists i predefined
12:48:49 <Shamino> so i can use as and bs
12:49:46 <Dark-Star> ok so your first attempt was correct. Then why do you need 2 parameters for your constructor? Each of your list elements has only one parameter, the "tail" of the list
12:50:16 <Dark-Star> so your list looks essentially something like this: (A (B (A (A End))))
12:50:38 <Dark-Star> notice that each constructor (A and B) takes exactly one argument, namely the "rest" of the list
12:51:19 <Dark-Star> brb...
12:51:41 <Shamino> but i got two tails and two heads
12:51:58 <Shamino> cant see the error
13:09:43 <Dark-Star> Shamino: why do you have two tails / heads?
13:10:06 <Dark-Star> Shamino: you mean because you have 2 lists? I can't seem to follow you...

13:36:25 <Goofy`> a haskell wiki?! Excellent!
13:36:36 <Riastradh> No, just a wiki about Haskell.
13:37:16 <Goofy`> will it evolve into something like something the pythonistas have? Theirs rock.
13:37:32 <Riastradh> It -IS- a Python wiki -- MoinMoin, to be precise.
13:37:55 <Goofy`> I meant more like a repository for groovy tricks and such.
13:37:56 <Dark-Star> Shamino: What did you mean, why do you have 2 lists?
13:37:58 <Riastradh> I keep bugging people to write one in Haskell, but nooooo!
13:38:01 <Riastradh> Oh.
13:38:05 <shapr> yes, HaWiki has groovy tricks
13:38:10 <shapr> well, NiftyTricks at least
13:38:11 <Riastradh> What shapr said.
13:38:41 <Goofy`> fantastic. Glad to see Haskell guys are on the bleeding edge, hehehe.
13:38:58 * Riastradh would start writing a -real- HaWiki (I'd prefer the name 'Hwiki' or 'Whiki' or something, though), but the ICFP contest is running.
13:38:59 <Goofy`> What do you call Haskell people anyway? Haskelleros?
13:39:08 * Riastradh has always said Haskellers.
13:39:27 <Goofy`> yeah, more friendly to the anglophones, I guess. :-)
13:39:37 <Riastradh> No, we're mostly Swedish here.
13:39:40 * Riastradh isn't, though.
13:39:50 <Goofy`> verkligen?
13:39:53 <Goofy`> that's hilarious.
13:39:59 <Riastradh> Verkligen...?
13:40:32 <Goofy`> well, I'm residing in Denmark, so my Swedish ain't up to snuff. How do you say "er det rigtikt?" paa svenska?
13:40:46 <shapr> är det riktigt?
13:40:48 <shapr> or something like that
13:40:51 <shapr> my swedish isn't very good either
13:40:55 <Goofy`> oh, same diff.
13:41:07 <Goofy`> What's the Haskell job market like. Does anyone know?
13:41:15 <shapr> I've been paid to write Haskell
13:41:32 <shapr> galois connections is expanding
13:41:39 <Goofy`> >that's great! Are you sure you'll be able to find the next job?
13:41:46 <shapr> I'm self-employed
13:41:58 <Goofy`> Good for you!
13:42:13 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: I get paid to write in Haskell :-)
13:42:32 <shapr> sometimes my clients don't want maintainable source as much as a quickly written solution
13:42:36 <shapr> in those cases I get to use Haskell
13:42:37 <Goofy`> syntax-laptop: by a bonafide software company?
13:42:55 <Goofy`> shapr: that's what draws me to Haskell, actually.
13:42:58 <Riastradh> Maintainable?  Haskell isn't maintainable!?!
13:43:02 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: yetp :) http://www.aetion.com
13:43:04 <Smerdyakov> Goofy`, why does it matter who pays?
13:43:16 <Goofy`> syntax-laptop: Thanks for the link!
13:43:22 <shapr> Riastradh: not by Java programmers, no
13:43:54 <Riastradh> shapr, well, it serves them right for being Java programmers!
13:44:44 <Goofy`> syntax-laptop: nice outfit. I can see why they choose Haskell for their apps. Strong, algo-heavy, small-yet-powerful...
13:44:54 <Goofy`> at least that's what it looks like to me.
13:45:20 <shapr> able to leap infinite sequences with a single bound
13:48:41 <Goofy`> I know I should probably do a little more research before I ask this, but since I'm on a roll here, I might as well shoot the works. Does Haskell have bindings for MySQL, GTK+ and good unicode support?
13:48:56 <Goofy`> and does it work with SWIG?
13:49:58 <shapr> no, it doesn't have SWIG bindings yet
13:50:01 <shapr> I do want that
13:50:17 <shapr> it does have MySQL, GTK+ and some unicode support
13:50:25 <Goofy`> brilliant!
13:50:26 <shapr> lambdabot uses postgresql for the @fact plugin
13:50:29 <andersca> gtk gtk
13:50:52 <Goofy`> Oh, I found the libraries/tools section on haskell.org. Wow, not bad...
13:51:53 <Goofy`> how does the cgi lib stack up? I'm kinda desillusioned with python's compared to what the perl guys got going.
13:52:08 <shapr> look for WASH
13:52:11 <shapr> and HWS-WP
13:52:25 <Goofy`> thanks, I'm right on it.
13:52:38 <Riastradh> WASH is way cooler than anything in Perl or Python.
13:53:35 <Goofy`> yeah, I kinda got a lumb in the throat perusing the page!
13:54:43 <Riastradh> A lumb?  What's a lumb?
13:54:54 <shapr> lump?
13:54:59 <Riastradh> A cross between a limb and a lump?
13:55:09 <Riastradh> Yikes, a lumpy limb got stuck in your throat??
13:55:15 <Goofy`> No, a misspelled lump, only more aggressive and stuff.
13:55:56 <Goofy`> so, what are Haskell's ultraweak and piss-poor points? ;-) Fess up, no language is perfect!
13:56:22 <shapr> not enough standard libraries?
13:56:48 <Goofy`> That doesn't seem to be the problem from what you guys just showed me.
13:57:04 <tez> Not enough popularity? ;-)
13:57:05 <shapr> well, there's not a decent pop3 lib, nor a decent imap4r1 lib
13:57:37 <Goofy`> those are minor points, and languages evolve all the time. I'm sure they'll come pretty darn soon.
13:57:38 <shapr> probably the weakest point of Haskell is that some people have trouble understanding monads
13:58:02 <shapr> monads are an abstraction similar to objects, but many people have difficulty making the jump to using them
13:58:23 <Goofy`> what are they abstractions *of*? Functions?
13:58:29 <Riastradh> An abstraction 'similar to objects?'
13:58:42 <andersca> you do something somewhere
13:58:45 <andersca> and then you end up someplace else
13:58:49 <andersca> and then you do something else there
13:58:50 <shapr> sure, they do hiding of some flavor
13:58:53 <shapr> so do objects
13:58:53 <andersca> and end up in a third place
13:58:55 <andersca> etc etc :)
13:59:09 <Goofy`> Sounds like a virus on the loose, ha ha!
13:59:36 <Goofy`> Do they have any resemblence to lisp macros by any chance?
13:59:50 <Goofy`> i.e., functions that write functions.
14:00:22 <tez> There is Template Haskell.
14:00:33 <Riastradh> Template Haskell is way inferior to Lisp macros, though.
14:00:50 <shapr> but it does do static type checking of the generated code
14:00:54 <shapr> and I don't know anything else that does that
14:01:07 <Shamino> Ceers
14:02:30 <Goofy`> I better check them monads fraggers out later. Mysterious gizmos always had an eerie pull on my.
14:02:39 <shapr> me too
14:02:44 <shapr> @fact gandalf
14:02:44 <lambdabot> Nothing
14:02:46 <shapr> hmm
14:03:57 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: your analysis of Aetion and its decision to use Haskell is pretty good.
14:04:12 <Goofy`> Once last pain-in-the-neck question before I head off to NeverLand. If I were to pick up just ONE book on Haskell, what would you guys recommend? The School of Expressions? The Craft? Haskell 98 and Libraries?
14:04:20 <Goofy`> syntax-laptop: thanks man.
14:04:29 <shapr> @fact gandalf Perilous to all of us are the devices of an art deeper than we ourselves possess. -- Gandalf the Grey [J.R.R. Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings"]
14:04:29 <lambdabot> set gandalf to Perilous to all of us are the devices of an art deeper than we ourselves possess. -- Gandalf the Grey [J.R.R. Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings"]
14:04:32 <syntax-laptop> IMHO, there's also an "unspoken" reason in that when programmers have fun programming, they do a better job.
14:04:38 <syntax-laptop> and Haskell is fun.
14:04:59 <Goofy`> amen, said the pyrate... :-)
14:05:14 <Goofy`> waaarrgh! Shiver me timbers!
14:05:52 * shapr agrees strongly with syntax-laptop
14:06:17 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: If you are used to reading books on programming and like it that way, I would recommnend The Craft, if you want something a little different, I recommend "School of Expression", and a more verbose version of my recommendations can be found on the wiki...
14:06:26 <syntax-laptop> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LearningHaskell
14:06:26 * Riastradh very strongly agrees with syntax-laptop about fun programming.
14:06:43 <syntax-laptop> (goofy' the second entry on that page)
14:06:48 <Riastradh> -Fun-ctional programming...
14:07:09 <Goofy`> syntax-laptop: wonderful. I'll use both. Which one gives the best coverage on monads, do you happen to know that?
14:07:25 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: while you're at the wiki, btw, see http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LibrariesAndTools
14:07:48 <Riastradh> 16:03 < Riastradh> I run 'vi' and get...a bunch of tildes.
14:07:50 <Riastradh> Er.
14:07:54 * Riastradh kicks X copy and paste.
14:08:01 <syntax-laptop> Goofy`: I liked Craft's treatment of Monads better, but I had both of them when I was learning about monads, so I read both, as well as some papers :)
14:08:01 <Riastradh> http://www.abercrombiegroup.co.uk/~noel/research/monads.html
14:08:08 <Riastradh> There.  Read that to get good coverage on monads.
14:08:29 <syntax-laptop> School of Expression (SOE) is based on programming graphics and animation, and is a little more Fun, I think :)
14:08:40 <Goofy`> Riastradh: you're the man. Now I'm friggin' hooks on the things!
14:09:32 <Goofy`> Well, I'll be off and bone on up this stuf before hitting the hay.
14:09:41 <syntax-laptop> peace Goofy`
14:09:46 <Goofy`> You guys have been great, I'll be back soon!
14:09:46 <Riastradh> Come here when you have questions.
14:09:52 <Goofy`> no sweat!
14:10:06 <Riastradh> Whee.  That was a quick Haskell convert!
14:10:53 * shapr cheers
14:10:58 <shapr> he's even using ERC
14:11:00 <shapr> he'll fit right in
14:14:15 <syntax-laptop> goofy was pretty enthusiastic :)
14:14:22 <Riastradh> Indeed.
14:58:41 <shapr> at some point #haskell will reach critical enthusiasm mass, and the whole irc network will explode
14:59:07 <andersca> it'll overflow
15:10:53 <andersca> jolta!
15:11:07 * Riastradh imploofs.
15:13:04 * Arnia steals the trampoline
15:14:07 <Jolta> hallo!
15:14:18 <Riastradh> Hullo!
15:15:01 <Jolta> so, everyone's working on the icfp problem, then?
15:15:10 * Marvin-- grumbles
15:15:59 * andersca *hearts* client side fonts
15:16:18 <Jolta> yeah, Marvin--, I know. =)
15:16:25 * Heffalump and Igloo are working on a car that is very good at crashing
15:17:37 <Marvin--> damn, less than 26 hours left
15:18:36 <Marvin--> I wonder what the heck the people who entered the lightning division did
15:18:48 <Heffalump> oh dear :(
15:18:59 <Heffalump> well, Igloo had a really stupid driver that swerved all over the track
15:19:02 <Riastradh> Apparently twelve people submitted entries to the lightning division.
15:19:35 <Marvin--> wasn't it 19?
15:20:08 <Riastradh> Oh.
15:20:10 <Riastradh> Something like that.
15:21:23 <Heffalump> I wonder how many could do all the tracks
15:26:54 <Marvin--> guh, I'm off to bed
15:32:22 <andersca> re shapr
15:32:28 <shapr> re
15:32:32 <andersca> splay trees seem cool
15:32:41 <shapr> but how do you desplay them?
15:38:37 <Heffalump> Splaymap.listItems
15:38:42 * shapr grins
15:42:31 <shapr> how do I put a condition in a list comp?
15:45:42 <Heffalump> [x | x<-xs, x==0]
15:45:48 <shapr> ah
15:46:18 <shapr> thanks
15:47:21 <Smerdyakov> That should be an interesting result! HAHA!
15:56:01 <shapr> hi mistj 
15:56:10 <shapr> by mistj
16:01:49 <shapr> re mistj 
16:02:08 <mistj> hi, what does re mean
16:02:14 <shapr> rehi
16:02:17 <shapr> as in, hello again.
16:02:30 <mistj> huh, which language is this
16:02:34 <shapr> it's ircspeak
16:03:05 <shapr> would you like to learn Haskell?
16:03:05 <mistj> :) ok, I will have to learn this eventualy
16:03:57 <mistj> I am looking around for interesting technologies... I never used functionall lang before
16:04:10 <shapr> FP langs are fun.
16:04:15 <shapr> and interesting
16:04:15 <syntax-laptop> and intersting!
16:04:16 <mistj> so haskel is a little unusual at first sight ti me
16:04:30 <shapr> @fact learning
16:04:30 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
16:04:35 <shapr> that's a good place to start
16:04:54 <shapr> do you have any immediate questions?
16:05:22 <mistj> :) not yet
16:05:32 <shapr> ok, feel free to ask if you think of some questions.
16:05:47 <mistj> thanks , you are very friendly folks
16:05:54 <shapr> We try :-)
16:06:57 <shapr> I think Haskell is a useful and powerful language, and I want to tell other people why I think that :-)
16:07:05 <shapr> so if you visit here, I'll try to tell you.
16:07:48 * syntax-laptop too
16:08:21 * Arnia loves haskell and wants to have its children
16:08:23 <mistj> I am interested in that... why you think that?
16:08:30 <mistj> :))
16:09:04 <shapr> first because of higher order functions
16:09:24 <mistj> what does tha mean?
16:09:26 <shapr> @eval map \x.x+1 [1,2,3]
16:09:27 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
16:09:30 <shapr> hm
16:09:52 <shapr> map (\x -> x + 1) [1,2,3,4]
16:09:54 <shapr> [2,3,4,5]
16:10:10 <shapr> a function without a name is built like \x -> x + 1
16:10:10 <Riastradh> @eval map (\x.x+1) [1,2,3]
16:10:10 <lambdabot> [2, 3, 4]
16:10:13 <shapr> aha
16:10:27 <mistj> huh..:))
16:10:28 <shapr> @eval (\x.x+1) 1
16:10:28 <lambdabot> 2
16:10:31 <shapr> @eval (\x.x+1) 2
16:10:31 <lambdabot> 3
16:10:46 <shapr> so that function (\x -> x + 1) just adds one to a number, see?
16:10:56 <jlouis> succ x = x+1
16:10:56 <syntax-laptop> that guy who was in here, shamino, came into #osuoss first (the open source club's IRC channel) and thought that was the Haskell channel.  So I googled for "haskell irc channel" and notice that the open source club's web page is 2nd int he list.
16:11:03 <shapr> lambdabot uses slightly different syntax, it has a dot instead of an arrow
16:11:21 <mistj> I really should read something before asking you:) half of this I don't understand
16:11:26 <cale> you can have functions that take functions and transform them into other functions.
16:11:36 * syntax-laptop notices that Higher Order Type is not filled in on the wiki yet :)
16:11:37 <shapr> mistj: you've used functions that do something to a value, right?
16:11:50 <mistj> yes
16:12:25 <shapr> the map function takes two parameters, a collection of things
16:12:29 <shapr> in this case a list of numbers
16:12:43 <shapr> and a function that does something to each item in that collection
16:12:56 <mistj> aha..
16:13:13 <shapr> so the map call above says "add one to each number in this list"
16:13:29 <cale> suppose that you have a function that takes values of type A to values of type B call it f - then map f is a function that takes a list of A's and applies f to each element and gives a list of B's.
16:13:55 <syntax-laptop> mistj: so you can pass functions around as if they were just normal thingies (in haskell, they are rather normal thingies)
16:14:17 <shapr> right, a function is a value too
16:14:20 <mistj> wow... i understood this:)
16:14:32 <shapr> it's not hard, just that most programmers don't know about it.
16:14:56 <shapr> there are other useful higher order functions
16:14:56 <mistj> it seems very interesting
16:15:19 <shapr> @eval filter (\x.x < 5) [3,4,5,6,7]
16:15:19 <lambdabot> [3, 4]
16:15:26 <mistj> :)
16:15:31 <mistj> i understood
16:15:38 <mistj> this one
16:16:07 <mistj> :) this irc learning was very efective
16:16:17 <syntax-laptop> mistj: do you know any other programming language?
16:16:17 <shapr> @eval foldr1 (+) [1,1,1]
16:16:18 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 9):
16:16:18 <lambdabot> unexpected "+"
16:16:18 <lambdabot> expecting simple term
16:16:23 <shapr> @eval foldr (+) [1,1,1]
16:16:23 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 8):
16:16:23 <lambdabot> unexpected "+"
16:16:23 <lambdabot> expecting simple term
16:16:24 <shapr> hm
16:16:33 <shapr> @eval foldr (\x y. x + y) [1,1,1]
16:16:33 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
16:16:36 <cale> foldr needs a zero
16:16:37 * syntax-laptop always gets mad that Java doesn't allow functions as higher-order types
16:16:42 <mistj> python, php, c/c++ , rebol
16:16:44 <shapr> @eval foldr (\x y. x + y) 0 [1,1,1]
16:16:44 <lambdabot> 3
16:16:45 <shapr> aha
16:16:52 <shapr> @eval foldr1 (\x y. x + y) [1,1,1]
16:16:52 <lambdabot> 3
16:17:28 <shapr> mistj: foldr is like rolling up a newspaper, but it applies the function to the result and the next value in the list
16:17:44 <shapr> so that was like (1 + 1 + 1)
16:17:47 <Jolta> one good thing about Haskell is that there are some nice interactive interpreters (Hugs, GHCI), which a beginner might find helps. The lambdabot can be a bit unwieldy. =)
16:17:48 <shapr> make sense?
16:17:57 <syntax-laptop> hm. I know only C/C++ of those.  In C/C++, you can pass around function pointers, which can be similar, but I think is less supported by the type system.
16:18:01 <shapr> yes, lambdabot can be unwieldy
16:18:09 <shapr> it sure is great for demonstrations though :-)
16:18:25 <mistj> I am already downloading higs
16:18:28 <mistj> hugs
16:18:51 <shapr> mistj: so, have you used Java, or C/C++ ?
16:19:07 <Jolta> shapr: yes, although one should perhaps test one's expressions in a private message to it so one does not clutter the channel with error messages. ;-)
16:19:12 <shapr> Jolta: that's true
16:19:17 <mistj> no java, c/c++ to some degree
16:19:18 <shapr> I'll do that in the future :-)
16:19:26 <Jolta> (not that i'm any better) =)
16:19:37 <shapr> mistj: have you ever looped over a collection but your index was one too high, or one too low?
16:19:56 <Riastradh> e.g., in a 'for' loop.
16:19:57 * Jolta throws a null pointer exception
16:20:20 <shapr> when I used Java a lot, I could never remember which things start at zero, and which start at one
16:20:23 <Jolta> or rather, "index out of bounds"
16:20:27 <shapr> I never have this problem in Haskell.
16:20:29 <mistj> :))
16:20:44 * cale catches the null pointer exception, but fails to handle it correctly and dies.
16:20:51 * shapr snickers
16:21:15 * Riastradh gracefully and monadically catches the exception and handles it with elegance.
16:21:33 <shapr> another thing I like about Haskell is partial application
16:21:35 <mistj> do you do this here vith loops ( like for..) or with this higher order functions
16:21:56 <Riastradh> Higher-order functions or comprehensions.
16:22:09 <shapr> oh and recursion with pattern matching
16:22:23 <shapr> length [] = 0
16:22:32 <shapr> length (x:xs) = length xs + 1
16:22:49 <shapr> that's how you find the length of a list in Haskell.
16:23:00 <mistj> what does (x:xs) represent
16:23:20 <cale> a list starting with x, and the rest called xs.
16:23:23 <shapr> it means, assign the first item in the list to the variable x, and assign the rest of the list to xs
16:23:50 <Riastradh> x:xs is a pair whose head is x and whose tail is xs -- it's how linked lists are represented.
16:24:00 <Arnia> map f [] = []
16:24:23 <Arnia> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
16:24:55 <mistj> ok... it makes sence now:)
16:25:39 <shapr> @define myadd (\x y . x + y)
16:25:39 <lambdabot> myadd defined
16:25:48 <shapr> @eval map (myadd 1) [1,2,3,4]
16:25:48 <lambdabot> [2, 3, 4, 5]
16:26:12 <Jolta> it takes a while to get used to thinking recursively. don't give up!
16:26:20 <mistj> :) no no
16:26:24 <shapr> partial application means you can fill in some of the arguments of a function, and you get back the 'rest' of the function
16:26:27 <mistj> I get this eval:))
16:26:51 <mistj> huh... another alien thing
16:27:05 <shapr> @type (+)
16:27:05 <lambdabot> (+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
16:27:10 <shapr> @type (+ 1)
16:27:10 <lambdabot> flip (+) 1 :: Num a => a -> a
16:27:42 <shapr> (myadd 1) acts like (\x . x + 1)
16:28:02 <Jolta> shapr: now you're confusing him. and me. =)
16:28:07 <shapr> oh, sorry
16:28:24 <Arnia> @type (1 +)
16:28:24 <lambdabot> (1 +) :: Num a => a -> a
16:28:31 <shapr> right
16:28:46 <Arnia> @type flip
16:28:46 <lambdabot> flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
16:29:05 <Arnia> Yay for HOTs :)
16:29:09 <Jolta> mistj: Do you know anything about Lambda Calculus?
16:29:24 <shapr> so, the type of a function is (a -> b), meaning take in something of type a, return something of type b
16:29:28 <mistj> huh... what does @type do
16:29:42 <shapr> it looks up the type signature of one of the standard Haskell functions.
16:29:43 <Riastradh> @type \x -> x
16:29:43 <lambdabot> \x -> x :: a -> a
16:29:54 <Riastradh> No, shapr, that's @prelude.
16:29:57 <Jolta> all commands starting with @ are caught by the lambdabot.
16:30:00 <shapr> er, right
16:30:03 <shapr> Riastradh: good point
16:30:07 * shapr drinks more coffee
16:30:14 <mistj> :)
16:30:18 <Arnia> @prelude foldr
16:30:19 <lambdabot> *** "foldr" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
16:30:19 <lambdabot> foldr
16:30:19 <lambdabot>   foldr ::  (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
16:30:19 <lambdabot>   foldr f z []      = z
16:30:20 <lambdabot>   foldr f z (x:xs)  = f x (foldr f z xs)
16:30:37 <Arnia> It gives the definition as well? Cool
16:30:54 <Arnia> @fact fruit
16:30:54 <lambdabot> Functionally Reactive User Interfaces
16:30:55 <Riastradh> @type x does:  echo x | hugs | awk -F'\n' '{print $($R - 1)}'  or something of the sort.
16:31:02 <mistj> :) really .. i must admit haskel is interesting
16:31:15 <shapr> there's more stuff too
16:31:19 <mistj> can I ask something else
16:31:21 <shapr> sure
16:31:23 <Riastradh> Monads!  Arrows!
16:31:29 <mistj> :)
16:31:35 <Jolta> Riastradh: whee!
16:31:44 <Arnia> Arrows are so superior to monads and functions...
16:31:45 <Riastradh> Monoids!  (well, they're pretty easy)
16:31:50 <mistj> I will read it slowly:) this is too fast for me
16:31:55 <shapr> mongols!
16:32:00 <Riastradh> mistj, what's your question?
16:32:01 * Arnia moves to make Haskell the first arrowdic language
16:32:05 <Jolta> yes, let's not get into monads just yet
16:32:07 <shapr> mistj: yes, what is your question?
16:32:32 <shapr> hi arguile 
16:32:38 <arguile> Allo
16:32:48 <shapr> do you have a kilt?
16:32:56 <arguile> No, just socks
16:33:02 <shapr> oh, cool
16:33:11 <shapr> do you have pictures of your socks online?
16:33:13 <Riastradh> A Campbell or just a nick similar to Argyll?
16:33:51 <mistj> what are haskel output/input/interacting abilities... I mean interacting with internet/files/db/...
16:34:06 <shapr> the @fact plugin for lambdabot uses PostgreSQL
16:34:17 <Arnia> And we were trying to avoid monads...
16:34:20 <Arnia> ;)
16:34:23 <shapr> there are web servers, http client modules, CGI modules
16:34:24 <cale> http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/war23.html -- "You can't make a freedom omelette without breaking a few international law eggs!"
16:34:41 <Arnia> @yow
16:34:41 <Riastradh> mistj, don't bother with IO until you understand monads.
16:34:41 <lambdabot> WHOA!!  I'm having a RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE right NOW!!
16:34:48 <Riastradh> Don't bother with monads until you understand the rest of Haskell.
16:35:13 <mistj> ok :)
16:35:24 <cale> er, I think that how to use IO can be well understood without understanding how monads work.
16:35:31 <shapr> yes, that's true
16:35:37 <Riastradh> VHOA!!  I'm hefeeng a RELIGIOOoS IXPERIENCE reeght NOV!!
16:35:37 <Riastradh> Bork Bork Bork!
16:35:43 <shapr> @fortune
16:35:43 <lambdabot> To laugh at men of sense is the privilege of fools.
16:35:54 <Riastradh> cale, yes, but then you're not understanding what you're doing, which is in this case a bad idea.
16:36:17 <Riastradh> @yow-chef
16:36:17 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "yow-chef", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
16:36:19 <Riastradh> Humph.
16:36:26 <Riastradh> lambdabot should have a Swedish Zippy command.
16:36:29 <shapr> Riastradh: quick, write it!
16:36:35 <Riastradh> Nope, sorry, ICFP contest.
16:36:36 <shapr> polli: hellooo
16:36:37 <shapr> oh, ok
16:36:42 <shapr> yah, me too
16:36:55 <arguile> Is that on right now?
16:36:59 <shapr> mistj: do you have any other questions?
16:37:15 <shapr> arguile: yup, http://icfpcontest.org/
16:37:41 <mistj> :) not for now thanks.. you gave me some basic so  reading docs will be much easier
16:37:56 <shapr> ok, feel free to ask questions when you have them
16:38:30 <mistj> as I understand some things concepts , before it wass all blank
16:38:39 <arguile> Eek. Oh well. I had meant to join the lightning round.
16:39:06 <Jolta> @hello
16:39:07 <lambdabot> Hello world. 
16:39:10 <Jolta> @goodbye
16:39:10 <lambdabot> Hello world. 
16:39:17 <Jolta> Hm. Interestink.
16:39:22 <Arnia> A sureal bot :)
16:39:25 <Arnia> @yow
16:39:25 <lambdabot> Today, THREE WINOS from DETROIT sold me a framed photo of
16:39:25 <lambdabot>  TAB HUNTER before his MAKEOVER!
16:39:58 <shapr> @yow
16:39:58 <lambdabot> I'm wearing PAMPERS!!
16:40:04 <shapr> kinky bot
16:40:15 <Jolta> how does one use the @lojban command?
16:40:20 <shapr> @lojban cilre
16:40:21 <lambdabot> ERROR: 501 Syntax error, illegal parameters
16:40:24 <shapr> urf
16:40:37 <shapr> I must have broken something recently
16:40:40 * shapr looks
16:40:43 <Jolta> that's what I keep getting too. Does it translate to or from lojban?
16:40:58 <shapr> right now it's just a DICT protocol lookup
16:41:17 <shapr> lojban.org used to have all the word files on a dict server
16:42:00 <shapr> I could add a jbofihe wrapper
16:42:44 * syntax-laptop sends in tasks-and-skills replies for debian NM process!
16:42:54 * syntax-laptop expects a pat on the back from Marvin soon.
16:44:25 <Jolta> I think you'd get one right now if Marvin was awake ...
16:45:11 <arguile> Oh wow. This years ICFP seems like tons of fun.... GA here I come :)
16:46:07 <Jolta> @fact icfp
16:46:08 <lambdabot> International Conference on Functional Programming, http://www.cs.luc.edu/icfp/
16:46:28 * arguile wonders if work would protest to him co-opting all the servers to run round on...
16:53:22 * syntax-laptop looks at the ICFP contest problem and wishes he had time to write a model-generator for it for the modeler mentioned here: http://www.aetion.com/technology.html (which I wrote in Haskell)
16:54:43 <Jolta> weel, goodnight, people.
16:54:54 <Jolta> woot! woot!
16:55:26 <cale> @yow
16:55:26 <lambdabot> ..  If I had heart failure right now, I couldn't be a more fortunate man!!
16:55:37 * syntax-laptop showers &
17:12:37 <cl1dev> is functional programming on the rise?
17:13:12 <mistj> thanks guys, for helping me... I will go to sleep now, bye
17:13:29 <cl1dev> i didn't help, but bye
17:13:42 <Heffalump> absolutely, 7 years ago I didn't do any and now I do
17:13:54 <cl1dev> well i'm doing it now too
17:13:56 <cl1dev> :)
17:14:17 <cl1dev> so its usage has increased by 2 in the last 7 years
17:14:42 <Heffalump> there's Igloo too, so 3.
17:15:17 <cl1dev> well someone mentioned that other languages are starting to get functional programming features (like python for instance)
17:15:43 <Riastradh> Python's lambda sucks.
17:15:56 <cl1dev> Riastradh: but the point is that it has it
17:16:05 <Riastradh> Well, I guess so.
17:16:57 <cl1dev> i'm just curious as to whether or not functional programming is going to over take what is more commonly used (OO programming)
17:17:25 <Arnia> Hope so ;)
17:17:44 <Riastradh> 'OOP' is too poorly defined for it to be 'replaced' by functional programming.
17:23:58 <cl1dev> Riastradh: what do you mean
17:24:05 * cl1dev was away talking to my mom for a sec
17:25:46 <Riastradh> cl1dev, define 'OOP.'
17:26:19 <cl1dev> object oriented programming, and the whole design process behind it (i.e. UML)
17:26:52 <Riastradh> Er, no, define 'object-oriented programming,' not what the acronym stands for.
17:27:39 <kenikov> He can easily find a definition.
17:27:50 <cl1dev> um, where everything in the problem space is broken up into objects that interact, or where a programmer makes an api and defines which methods on an object are public and which ones aren't
17:27:59 <Riastradh> 'Methods?'  Define methods.
17:28:22 <Riastradh> Are they what a Smalltalk programmer calls methods?
17:28:27 <Riastradh> Are they what a CLOS programmer calls methods?
17:28:36 <cl1dev> ok, i'm not here to teach class, and from your questions i believe you already know what object oriented programming is
17:28:38 <Riastradh> Or are they something yet different?
17:28:44 <Riastradh> No, I honestly don't.
17:29:16 <cl1dev> ok, we are gonna use a car as an example here ..
17:29:18 <Riastradh> I know what 'Smalltalk-style OOP,' 'prototype-based OOP,' 'CLOS-style OOP,' et cetera mean, but they're all quite definitely very different.
17:29:35 <Arnia> The term has been used very loosely... especially with respect to formalism.
17:29:42 <cl1dev> wtf is CLOS?
17:29:46 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: I think there are several reasons why OOP has risen to its current prominence.
17:29:50 <Riastradh> The Common Lisp Object System.
17:29:52 <Arnia> Common Lisp Object System
17:29:59 <Pseudonym> First, it was a natural fit for windowing GUIs.
17:30:11 <Pseudonym> Which rose to prominence at the same time.
17:30:29 <Pseudonym> But I think the most important reason is that OOP came hand-in-hand with Object Oriented Design.
17:30:54 <Pseudonym> That is, it came with a design methodology which captured a larger class of problems than previous methodologies.
17:31:08 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: yeah, but what about functional programming? it seems superior to OO based programming
17:31:13 <Pseudonym> Yes and no.
17:31:17 <Pseudonym> They do solve similar problems.
17:31:40 <Pseudonym> For many years the enemy of large, complex systems was external state.
17:32:03 <Pseudonym> If you look at a line of code, to understand it, you need to know a) where you are, and b) what data can be seen from here.
17:32:11 <Pseudonym> The more global state, the bigger b) is.
17:32:34 <Pseudonym> The OO solution is to replace "global state" with a large number of "local states".
17:32:48 <Pseudonym> The FP solution is not to have state at all.
17:32:51 * Riastradh eats pfhood.
17:33:00 <cl1dev> big problem consists of little problems, yeah
17:33:32 <Pseudonym> The nice thing about OO programming is that it formalises the older notion of a "module".
17:33:36 <cl1dev> so then FP doesn't follow finite state machine stuff?
17:33:48 <Pseudonym> If you read David Parnas' paper on modularisation, he notes that a module is a work unit.
17:34:00 <Pseudonym> It's an assignment of responsibility.
17:34:11 <Pseudonym> That fairly closely corresponds to "object" in OOP.
17:34:35 <cl1dev> ok
17:34:43 <Pseudonym> It also closely follows our intuition about "things" even in abstract space.
17:34:51 <Pseudonym> Things have properties and behaviour.
17:34:59 <Pseudonym> i.e. attributes and methods
17:35:05 <cl1dev> yeah, i understand that's why OO programming (or more so design) is used
17:35:16 <Pseudonym> Right.
17:35:29 <Pseudonym> But I still think the most important reason is because it came with a design methodology.
17:35:56 <cl1dev> so then FP doesn't have a design methodology? its just a way to "modularize" ?
17:36:10 <Pseudonym> Well, FP actually unifies a lot of older methodologies.
17:36:22 <Pseudonym> Jackson Standard Design, for example, is directly implementable in Haskell.
17:36:37 <Arnia> FP does have a proposed methodology called FAD... I'll find the thesis it was proposed it
17:36:40 <Arnia> s/it/in
17:36:40 <cl1dev> i dunno what that is but okay :)
17:36:46 <Pseudonym> JSD requires "buffers" when data travels up the dataflow diagram.  Not so in Haskell, where lazy evaluation does it all for you.
17:36:56 <Pseudonym> However, I think that programmers are going off OOD now.
17:37:06 <Pseudonym> At least they're starting to.
17:37:19 <Pseudonym> Someone recently noticed that there are very few "pure" OO programming languages.
17:37:20 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: example?
17:37:34 <Pseudonym> And those that are "pure" are not as useful as those that are not.
17:37:35 <cl1dev> recently? heh .. they must be slow
17:37:49 <Pseudonym> Well, by "recently"... the seeds were there in the mid-90s.
17:38:14 <Pseudonym> The new buzzword is "multi-paradigm design".
17:38:27 <Arnia> http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/pubs/2001/1152/index.html
17:38:29 <cl1dev> oh, i must really be out of the loop, i haven't hear of that one
17:38:38 <cl1dev> s/hear/heard/
17:38:48 <Pseudonym> How well do you know C++?
17:39:08 <Pseudonym> OK, scratch that.  Let's take Haskell.
17:39:09 <Pseudonym> :-)
17:39:27 <Pseudonym> Haskell supports: functional programming, imperative programming, object-oriented programming etc etc.
17:39:46 <Pseudonym> It's a multi-paradigm language.
17:40:03 <Pseudonym> Even Python and C++ support functionally-designed software.
17:40:18 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: i know c++ well enough to read it when i see it
17:40:23 <Pseudonym> It's not "native", but then global state is not "native" to Haskell, but you can simulate it.
17:40:38 <Pseudonym> OK.
17:40:47 <cl1dev> well you could do FP in C if you tried hard enough
17:40:52 <Pseudonym> Sure you could.
17:41:04 <Pseudonym> It's a bit easier in C++.  The syntax is nicer.
17:41:05 <Heffalump> I don't think Haskell does inheritance well enough to support the OO paradigm
17:41:08 <cl1dev> (that would be very ugly mind you)
17:41:16 <Arnia> Turing complete languages are lovely
17:41:17 <Pseudonym> Heffalump: It depends what you mean by "the OO paradigm".
17:41:42 <Pseudonym> I think it supports all of the bits that you need to implement an OO design well enough.
17:42:13 <Pseudonym> Especially if you have threads and something like haskell-ports or GHC channels.
17:42:34 <cl1dev> lets narrow down what OO is for this conversation, it isn't the specifics of any type its the whole "objects that have properties and methods" part of OO we are talking about here
17:43:15 <Pseudonym> What I mean by OO here is enough language/library support to implement an OO design conveniently.
17:43:42 <Pseudonym> Which, of course, is a circular definition. :-)
17:43:44 <cl1dev> what is this multi-paradigm stuff?
17:44:13 <Pseudonym> Well, multi-paradigm design is based on the principle that any sufficiently expressive design methodology should be prepared to use all of the features present in the language.
17:44:28 <Pseudonym> And that some things are best not modelled as objects.
17:44:41 <cl1dev> like work flow processes? :)
17:44:45 <Pseudonym> Sure.
17:44:55 <Pseudonym> The general idea is this:
17:45:04 <Pseudonym> You have some things which you want to model.
17:45:18 <Pseudonym> You group these things into families.
17:45:33 <Pseudonym> Hmm... let's pick an example.
17:45:42 <Pseudonym> Uhm... can you think of a good one?
17:45:46 <cl1dev> cars?
17:45:56 <cl1dev> parts on cars that interact? is that good enough?
17:45:59 <Pseudonym> Well, let's say "vehicles".
17:46:00 * cl1dev likes cars
17:46:02 <Pseudonym> And parts of cars.
17:46:03 <Pseudonym> OK.
17:46:20 <Pseudonym> Different car parts are similar in some ways and different in others.
17:46:32 <Pseudonym> All gaskets, for example, are fundamentally similar.
17:46:37 <Pseudonym> But they differ in shape.
17:46:53 <cl1dev> sure, you could say that
17:47:07 <Pseudonym> All road vehicles are fundamentally similar.
17:47:13 <Pseudonym> But they differ in some ways.
17:47:15 <cl1dev> that is for sure
17:47:17 <Pseudonym> What features they have, for example.
17:47:29 <Pseudonym> A bicycle has no motor, but it still has a steering mechanism.
17:47:44 <cl1dev> right
17:48:12 <Pseudonym> The idea behind multi-paradigm design is to analyse how the members of a family are the same (commonality) and how they are different (variability).
17:48:50 <Pseudonym> Once you've worked that out, that generally maps to a language feature or design pattern which supports that commonality/variability combination directly.
17:49:00 <cl1dev> like tires, they have different tread patterns for different vehicles because different vehicles serve different purposes
17:49:40 <Pseudonym> For example, suppose you have some information which has the same structure (commonality) but different values (variability).  That's called "data".
17:49:50 <cl1dev> oh, i see so the variability vs commonality isn't always best modeled as OO
17:49:51 <Pseudonym> A C struct is a language feature which supports it.
17:50:00 <Pseudonym> So is a Haskell record.
17:50:05 <Pseudonym> Right, you're getting the idea.
17:50:16 * cl1dev hasn't made it that far into haskell to know what a record is
17:50:21 * cl1dev just got to types today :)
17:50:25 <Pseudonym> Well, it's like a C struct.
17:50:32 <Pseudonym> :-)
17:50:43 <cl1dev> its a container for data
17:50:54 <Pseudonym> Right.
17:51:09 <Pseudonym> But it's also a way for implementing families of data with the same structure but different values.
17:51:14 <Pseudonym> That's another way of looking at it.
17:51:20 <Pseudonym> In terms of commonality and variability.
17:51:33 <cl1dev> depending on what data you put in there it could be like a record in a database or a list of properties for an object
17:51:58 <Pseudonym> As another example, suppose you need a family of functions which work on essentially the same kind of data, but varies on some type buried in the data somewhere.
17:52:07 <cl1dev> where different records have different values and different objects of the same type have different values for the same properties (like tire size, they all have tires but different sizes)
17:52:13 <Pseudonym> In C++, a feature which supports this is templates.  In Haskell, it's parametric polymorphism.
17:52:45 <cl1dev> hmm @ parametric polymorphism, i haven't delt with templates much at all
17:53:01 <Pseudonym> Well, templates in C++ are kind of like parametric polymorphism in Haskell;
17:53:04 <Pseudonym> Kind of.
17:53:14 <Pseudonym> They're not the same, but they play a similar role.
17:53:20 <cl1dev> but i sorta get the idea, its generic because the function applied is common across more than one data type, right?
17:53:29 <Pseudonym> Yeah, kind of like that.
17:54:26 <Pseudonym> As another example, suppose you have a family of functions which are related by having the same name (commonality) but are different in their implementations (variability).  The solution for this in C++ is ad-hoc overloading.
17:54:33 <Pseudonym> In Haskell, it'd be a single-member typeclass.
17:54:44 <Pseudonym> Probably with fundeps.
17:56:21 <cl1dev> fundeps?
17:56:37 <Riastradh> Learn about typeclasses first.
17:56:50 <cl1dev> Riastradh: will do
17:56:50 <syntax-laptop> boing!
17:57:05 * Riastradh exploings.
17:57:23 * cale logloings.
17:57:31 * Riastradh paraloings.
17:57:45 <cale> oh no.
17:57:50 <cale> :)
17:58:02 <cl1dev> (weirdos)
17:58:09 <cl1dev> (all of em)
17:58:12 * Arnia returns the trampoline
17:58:42 <cl1dev> am i gonna end up like this if i do FP long enough?
17:58:44 <cl1dev> lol
17:58:47 <cl1dev> j/k
17:58:55 <syntax-laptop> heh
17:59:19 <syntax-laptop> cl1dev: you will probably feel free to happily bounce around if you use Haskell long enough
18:00:43 <cale> http://www.jacksons-camping.co.uk/kidstuff/moretrampolines.htm -- "Fun closure".
18:00:46 <cl1dev> i was practically bouncing around after i implemented my own map function
18:01:16 <cl1dev> that was the coolest, and most productive 2 lines of code i've ever written
18:01:23 <Pseudonym> Sorry afk
18:01:25 <Pseudonym> Back now.
18:01:45 <cl1dev> sheesh! leaving, what were you thinking?
18:01:50 * cl1dev smacks Pseudonym around
18:01:52 <Pseudonym> Getting coffee, of course.
18:01:57 <Pseudonym> Duh.
18:01:57 * Riastradh imploings.
18:02:00 <cl1dev> eww @ coffee
18:02:23 <cl1dev> i only like coffee with a ton of sugar, and since i'm diabetic now, i can't do that .. heh
18:02:41 <Pseudonym> Persecute!  Kill the heretic!
18:02:44 * Arnia ploings a plone
18:02:56 <Arnia> Candarel
18:03:09 <Pseudonym> Make mine a large espresso with nothing else in it.
18:03:14 <Pseudonym> The closer to crude oil the better.
18:03:29 <inkedmn> methods = functions that belong to a specific object
18:03:32 <cl1dev> you could just chew instant, would that work?
18:03:35 <cale> mmm, espresso...
18:03:46 <inkedmn> wow, ignore the hell out of me, please
18:03:59 <cl1dev> i live on sodas, i get plenty of caffine
18:04:12 <cl1dev> diet ones of course
18:04:18 <cl1dev> speaking of
18:04:27 * cl1dev runs to the fridge for another soda
18:05:07 <cale> Aspartame is evil.
18:05:09 <cl1dev> ok, i'm back
18:05:23 <Arnia> I have no choice
18:05:23 <cale> (although I guess if you're diabetic)
18:05:29 <cl1dev> cale: i know, don't care, the smoking will kill me first, if the auto racing doesn't
18:05:45 <Arnia> Aspartame or death in a really unpleasant way (type 1 diabetes is a real arse)
18:05:58 <cl1dev> Arnia: tell me about it!!
18:06:47 <Arnia> I love IRC for topic drift greater than Usenet
18:07:15 <cl1dev> i almost passed out in traffic the other day cause it was hot, i didn't have any gas(so i couldn't use the A/C) and no one would let me over to the side of the road so i could get to a gas station (for something to drink + gas)
18:07:31 <cl1dev> it was a parking lot on the highway
18:08:07 <Strike> cl1dev: I bet you at least see snow every year ;) 
18:08:20 <cl1dev> Strike: not every year
18:08:28 * cl1dev lives in texas
18:08:31 * Strike does too
18:08:36 <cl1dev> LOL
18:08:39 <Strike> I looked at your hostmask :)
18:08:49 <Strike> DFW tends to get snow a lot more often than Houston :)
18:08:50 <cl1dev> (buncha nosey ass people)
18:08:55 <cl1dev> everyone looks at that
18:09:10 <cl1dev> not that i really care or anything
18:09:18 <Arnia> I'm curious... can people tell what town I'm in?
18:09:21 * Strike can count the number of times that it has snowed in Houston in the past 20+ years on one hand
18:09:23 <cale> that's the real way to tell the difference between people on irc.
18:09:29 <cl1dev> Strike: yeah it does, but it doesn't always make it to the ground either
18:09:30 <Strike> Arnia: just UK
18:09:45 <cl1dev> cale: how so?
18:10:02 <Strike> via their hostmasks, I presume
18:10:26 <cl1dev> changes his to goatse.cx
18:11:13 <Strike> heh
18:11:15 <cale> It's slightly more reliable to look at someone's hostmask than their nick.
18:11:31 <inkedmn> never snowed here
18:11:32 <Strike> cl1dev: they do run an IRC server if you want to go ...
18:11:40 <Strike> inkedmn: shush
18:11:47 <cl1dev> hmm, that's scary
18:11:49 <inkedmn> Strike: emwa
18:12:01 <Pseudonym> cl1dv: Sorry, boss key.
18:12:10 <Pseudonym> Instant coffee?  You're joking, right?
18:12:17 <shapr> oh, I want a boss key.
18:12:23 <shapr> then I could get into any door in the house.
18:12:26 <Pseudonym> G'day, shapr.
18:12:47 <cale> birmingham?
18:12:49 <cl1dev> um i missed something, what tangent did "boss key" come from here?
18:12:51 <inkedmn> howdy shapr, Pseudonym 
18:12:51 <shapr> hi Pseudonym 
18:12:55 <Pseudonym> <inkedmn> Sorry, back to you.
18:12:56 <shapr> hi inkedmn 
18:13:02 <cale> close to birmingham?
18:13:06 <Pseudonym> "functions that belong to a specific object"
18:13:09 <shapr> what about birmingham?
18:13:09 * Pseudonym hmms
18:13:12 <Arnia> Birmingham? No... a long way from there
18:13:14 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: yes, the instant coffee was a joke
18:13:15 <Pseudonym> Unsure about that.
18:13:18 <shapr> I'm from Birmingham.
18:13:22 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: OK, just checking.
18:13:42 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: for the record, i have eaten it before (on a dare)
18:13:50 <cale> Arnia asked people what they could tell about his location from his hostname.
18:13:54 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: I hope it was decent instant coffee.
18:13:54 <shapr> it snowed once in Birmingham too.
18:14:00 <shapr> the city shut down for three days.
18:14:05 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: foldgers
18:14:11 <Pseudonym> Dunno that one.
18:14:11 <Arnia> I'm further north than brum
18:14:30 <Pseudonym> I think of a "method" as an object's behaviour.
18:14:40 <cl1dev> yes, exactly
18:14:40 <shapr> they call it birminhayum where I'm from.
18:14:50 <Pseudonym> Or a part of the work that the object (i.e. work unit) has to do.
18:14:54 <cale> Arnia: The computer one hop away from you from me is snake.lns.birmingham.access.planet.net.uk
18:15:58 <cl1dev> so then OO fits in with functional programming, but how do you get programmers to do functional programming? or is that just an elitist thing?
18:16:35 <cl1dev> most programmers i've seen can't code their way out of a wet paper sack
18:16:35 <Arnia> cale: I'm up in Durham
18:16:44 <cale> ah
18:17:04 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: Right, so fact is, it's not going to help them no matter what language technology they use.
18:17:51 <cl1dev> ok, then my real question should be, when is upper management gonna be seduced into using functional programming by big corperations?
18:17:52 <Pseudonym> Knowing how to use a programming language does not make you a programmer any more than knowing how to use a spreadsheet makes you an accountant.
18:18:26 <cl1dev> or if in fact that is already becoming practice in small circles?
18:18:27 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: Well at least one big corporation has already bitten.
18:18:36 <shapr> the NSA
18:18:42 <shapr> Xilinx
18:18:44 <Pseudonym> The NSA is a corporation?
18:18:44 <cl1dev> so FP is gaining ground! i knew it
18:18:51 <cl1dev> i wanna work for the NSA
18:18:54 <shapr> Pseudonym: or worse
18:18:57 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: No you don't.
18:19:04 <shapr> I do *not* want to work for the NSA.
18:19:13 <Pseudonym> You do not want to be a public servant.  Believe me on this.
18:19:27 <shapr> I just don't want to get to work at 8am everyday ;-)
18:19:33 * Pseudonym laughs
18:19:44 <cl1dev> yeah, all programming jobs should be nite jobs
18:19:48 <shapr> self-employment allows me to start work at 9pm
18:19:53 <Pseudonym> Working in the government sector is horrible.
18:20:32 <cale> shapr: what sort of business do you do?
18:20:34 <Pseudonym> I shouldn't badmouth the government sector.  Most of our clients are government.
18:20:39 <shapr> cale: programming
18:20:45 <shapr> cale: mostly web dev lately
18:20:49 <Pseudonym> But it's still a horrible working environment.
18:20:59 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: why is that?
18:21:03 <cl1dev> or is that classified?
18:21:04 <cl1dev> heh
18:21:08 * Pseudonym laughs
18:21:10 <shapr> cale: http://www.webwitches.com/
18:21:16 * shapr flagrantly advertises
18:21:24 <shapr> give me money! I will give you code!
18:21:30 <Pseudonym> Well I used to be a public servant here in Australia.  What I did wasn't classified (though it was a little bit secretive).
18:21:34 <cale> heh
18:21:37 <cale> :)
18:21:37 <shapr> on-time and under-budget
18:21:44 <shapr> mostly ;-)
18:21:45 <Arnia> shapr: Can I advertise too?
18:21:45 * cl1dev holds a "will race for food" sign
18:21:50 <shapr> Arnia: yes! advertise!
18:21:58 <Pseudonym> 1) Government jobs pay badly.
18:22:01 <shapr> netalley r0xx!
18:22:06 <Pseudonym> 2) If you're not doing core business, you don't exist.
18:22:09 <Arnia> www.netalleynetworks.com/solutions/ploneconsultancy/
18:22:25 <shapr> give Arnia money to do Plone stuff (he's one of the Plone developers)
18:22:28 <Pseudonym> 3) The result is lots of political infighting, backbiting and general unnecessary stress.
18:22:41 <Pseudonym> I can confidently tell you that there is no government conspiracy.
18:22:44 <shapr> Pseudonym: but you have job security
18:22:55 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: sounds like a regular day at the office of most IT departments
18:22:56 <Pseudonym> Any would-be conspirators are too busy squabbling amongst themselves.
18:23:09 <Pseudonym> Nah, it's far worse in the government sector.
18:23:14 <cale> An error was encountered while publishing this resource.
18:23:23 <Pseudonym> At least in the private sector, everyone has some idea what they're doing and why.
18:23:32 <Pseudonym> "We sell widgets" or whatever.
18:23:39 <cl1dev> ture
18:23:39 <Arnia> Yes... we are currently experiencing a config problem... its being fixed atm
18:23:41 <cl1dev> err true
18:23:57 <cl1dev> Arnia: its your web site?
18:24:03 * cl1dev plugs for clients
18:24:09 <cl1dev> i do web development :)
18:24:14 <shapr> with Zope?
18:24:15 <Arnia> If it can break, it will. If it can't it will, and at the worst possible time
18:24:15 * Pseudonym doesn't
18:24:20 * Pseudonym gave up web development
18:24:40 * cl1dev is giving up on web development
18:24:55 * shapr is doing more web dev
18:25:05 <cl1dev> hell i've given up on buisness applications altogether
18:25:09 <Pseudonym> I gave up web development after my former employers took my Federation-themed intranet site and stuck an animated genie on it.
18:25:17 <cl1dev> i wanna write code that's worth something (not drone work)
18:25:28 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: That's what I do!
18:25:31 <cl1dev> ROFLMAO
18:25:36 <Pseudonym> Seriously.
18:25:42 <cale> shapr: Have you seen wash? It looks cool.
18:25:46 <cl1dev> the laughing was at the whole trek/genie thing
18:25:47 <shapr> yes it does
18:25:50 <shapr> wash is very cool
18:25:51 <Pseudonym> Though, admittedly, everything is work.
18:25:57 <Pseudonym> No, not Trek.
18:26:03 <shapr> true, but some work is not rewarding.
18:26:15 <Pseudonym> Federation as in... states coming together to form a more perfect union, kind of thing.
18:26:22 <Pseudonym> Except the Australian equivalent.
18:26:22 <cl1dev> ah
18:26:44 <Pseudonym> It was for the Melbourne office of a certain organisation, so I made something that was very Melbourne.
18:26:53 <Pseudonym> Hint: I've lived in Melbourne all my life, and I've never seen a genie.
18:27:10 <cl1dev> *laughs again*
18:27:13 <Pseudonym> Although... I did live at a university college where a former master saw a leprechaun.
18:27:19 <Pseudonym> Well, we assume it was a leprechaun.
18:27:31 <cl1dev> (or really good acid)
18:27:31 <Pseudonym> It was a small man, dressed in green, who smoked a pipe and danced a jig.
18:27:37 <cale> Pseudonym: Oh, come on, whenever I think of Australia, the first thing that comes to mind is an annoying blue genie with bad text-to-speech.
18:27:51 <Pseudonym> cale: Uhm... yes, OK.
18:27:56 * Pseudonym backs away from cale slowly
18:28:03 <cale> heheh
18:28:18 * shapr grumbles
18:28:25 <Pseudonym> This master also ordered that the fountain be turned off because of the spirits living in it.
18:28:29 <shapr> I want Haskell lists to allow a trailing comma
18:28:31 <shapr> [1,2,]
18:28:33 <shapr> should be legal
18:28:40 <Pseudonym> It was 40 years later before it was turned back on.
18:29:10 <Pseudonym> shapr: Do you want it to mean something, or just to mean [1,2]?
18:29:15 <shapr> I want it to mean [1,2]
18:29:30 <cl1dev> shapr: why do you wanna type more?
18:29:36 <Strike> but [1,2] means [1,2] already..
18:29:45 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: He wants to be able to comment stuff out.
18:29:45 <shapr> yes, but if [1,2,] is also [1,2]
18:29:48 <shapr> right
18:30:01 <Strike> so comment the comma out too :)
18:30:03 <Pseudonym> shapr: You could try putting your commas at the _start_ of lines instead.
18:30:08 <Pseudonym> ["foo"
18:30:10 <Pseudonym> ,"bar"
18:30:10 <Pseudonym> ]
18:30:19 <Strike> just like good SQL writers do
18:30:21 <shapr> yes, but then I have to remember that something's different about the *first* item
18:30:21 <Pseudonym> Right.
18:30:22 <Strike> :)
18:30:23 <shapr> not the last item
18:30:32 <Pseudonym> You could try reading in a data file.
18:30:34 <Strike> shapr: other than the [ ? :)
18:30:37 <shapr> yes
18:30:45 <shapr> if a trailing comma were optional
18:30:52 <Strike> isn't that enough special stuff to remember?
18:31:08 <shapr> then you know you just put a comma at the end of every list item
18:31:10 * Riastradh really hates commas at the start of lines.
18:31:17 <shapr> and if you add items later, you don't have to worry about it
18:31:26 <Riastradh> It's like ,writing everything ,like this.
18:31:36 <cl1dev> shapr: are you trying to automate code generation?
18:31:41 <shapr> that's part of it
18:31:44 <Strike> Riastradh: but it makes sense for things like SQL
18:31:45 <cale> [
18:31:45 <cale> "foo"
18:31:45 <cale> ,"bar"
18:31:45 <cale> ,"quux"
18:31:45 <cale> ]
18:31:52 <shapr> but it's also about really huge multiline lists
18:31:56 <shapr> like my HUnit tests
18:32:02 <Riastradh> Strike, SQL /= Haskell.
18:32:10 <Riastradh> Er, how does it make sense for SQL?
18:32:21 <Strike> because it allows for easy commenting of an item ...
18:32:38 * cl1dev has written lotsa sql and never puts commas at the beginning of the line
18:32:49 <shapr> Strike: but you can't comment out the first item then
18:32:52 <cl1dev> i always put key words at the begining
18:32:54 <Pseudonym> shapr: If you're trying to automate code generation, why aren't you just using "show"?
18:32:55 <cale> perhaps being able to omit the comma would be nice.
18:33:22 <Strike> shapr: no matter HOW you do it, there's no way you can do it such that you can comment ANY given line out
18:33:31 <shapr> echo "item," >> list_file.txt 
18:33:40 <shapr> Strike: yes, there is
18:33:46 <shapr> allow a trailing comma
18:33:48 <cl1dev> [
18:33:49 <cl1dev> foo,
18:33:51 <cl1dev> bleh,
18:33:53 <Strike> shapr: but SQL doesn't
18:33:53 <cl1dev> are,
18:33:59 <cl1dev> ]
18:34:03 <shapr> neither does Haskell, that's why I complain :-)
18:34:12 <shapr> as cl1dev just showed
18:34:23 <Strike> right, but given the standard, leading commas are the best option
18:34:27 <Pseudonym> Do you want trailing commas in tuples too?
18:34:37 <cale> (hello,)
18:34:39 <shapr> I'm not picky about tuples
18:34:49 <Strike> cale: isn't that a REQUIRED trailing comma?
18:34:51 <shapr> they're not a sequence
18:34:56 <cale> yes
18:35:00 <shapr> tuples are a type
18:35:09 <cl1dev> why aren't each line a list of their own?
18:35:10 <Strike> okay just making sure
18:35:17 <cl1dev> s/aren't/isn't/
18:35:26 <Strike> and s/their/its/  ;)
18:36:04 <cl1dev> you could use ++ to concatinate them, correct?
18:36:08 <cale> It's a bit of an ugly required trailing comma, too, but there's not much that can be done about it.
18:36:31 <Strike> cale: yeah, unless you want to use something other than () to delimit tuples
18:36:46 <cl1dev> so hears what you do, instead of trailing commas, you make each line its own list and make that a function
18:37:00 <cl1dev> unit = [1,2,3,4,5]
18:37:19 <cl1dev> then all you need is another function that is a concatination of the lists you wanna use
18:37:43 <cl1dev> shapr: how does that sound?
18:38:11 <shapr> it's good for doing echo "item" >> list.txt
18:38:15 <cale> but singular tuples should be treated the same as items of the type that they wrap, anyway, as they're isomorphic.
18:38:19 <shapr> but it still doesn't help me with HUnit tests :-)
18:38:42 <cl1dev> why? becuase its already written?
18:39:14 <shapr> I define HUnit test inline in the TestList because otherwise I have to explicitly concat them
18:39:35 <shapr> so your solution is exactly what I was trying to avoid with HUnit :-)
18:40:28 <cl1dev> so then make a function that writes them to a file, then inline that, that way you can run one to change the other
18:40:39 <cl1dev> it doesn't all have to be in the same program at the same time
18:41:35 <shapr> I still think the optional trailing comma in lists is a simpler solution
18:42:31 <cl1dev> shapr: but it's not availible, so you need to come up with something else, correct?
18:42:38 <cl1dev> ooh
18:42:52 <cl1dev> what about []] as the last item in the list, would that work?
18:43:02 <cl1dev> then you could do ..
18:43:03 <cl1dev> [
18:43:06 <cl1dev> bleh,
18:43:08 <cl1dev> []]
18:43:18 <shapr> lists are homogenous
18:43:44 <cl1dev> well that blows
18:44:21 <cl1dev> do your list values have a range?
18:44:28 <Strike> shapr: you could store tham as "bleh:\nblah:\nblarg:\n[]"
18:44:30 <Strike> ;)
18:45:20 <shapr> cl1dev: I'll just ask the Haskell guys for an optional trailing comma, maybe they'll do it.
18:45:25 <Riastradh> shapr, just use block comments.
18:45:48 <cl1dev> if your list values have a range you can define a terminating constant for your list
18:46:07 <cl1dev> like if they are all positive, you could define -1 as the list terminator
18:48:41 <cl1dev> hmm ... could you do {- stuf here -- -}
18:49:23 <cl1dev> nm bad idea
18:49:35 <cl1dev> ok, i'm gonna go back to learning haskell, laters
18:50:23 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: Actually, this is a good example of multi-paradigm design. :-)
18:50:32 <Pseudonym> What you have here is "negative variability".
18:50:48 <Pseudonym> Also known as "the exception to the rule".
18:50:53 <cl1dev> hmm
18:50:54 <cl1dev> true
18:51:05 <Pseudonym> Anytime you see a C struct with a value which is sometimes ignored, that's negative variability.
18:51:39 <Pseudonym> Sentinel values are usually indicators of negative variability.
18:51:50 <Pseudonym> Anyway, just thought I'd confuse thigns.
18:51:54 <cl1dev> heh
18:51:59 <Pseudonym> Go learn Haskell.  We need more people. :-)
18:52:06 <cl1dev> okie dokie
18:52:58 <cl1dev> is the type system in haskell considered strong typing?
18:53:08 <syntax-laptop> cl1dev: yes!
18:53:24 <cl1dev> (is not exactly sure what strong typing is, but has an idea from its name)
18:53:48 <cl1dev> i wanna learn ada because i've heard it has the best strong typing
18:53:52 <Riastradh> Haskell is both strongly and statically typed.
18:56:17 <cl1dev> static means it doesn't change, right?
18:56:38 <Riastradh> No, static in this sense means 'done at compile-time.'
18:57:22 <Riastradh> Haskell has the best type system I have ever seen.  What's Ada's like?
18:57:42 <cl1dev> Riastradh: i dunno, but i wanna learn it, what little exposure i've had to it i've liked
18:57:53 <cl1dev> its case statements are really cool
18:58:01 <Riastradh> Its case statements?
18:58:34 <cl1dev> Riastradh: you know, switch/case statements?
18:58:43 <Riastradh> Yes.
18:59:34 <cl1dev> there case statements have things like 'case 1..5' which is all values from 1 to 5 fall under that case
18:59:53 * Riastradh isn't very impressed.
19:00:13 <cl1dev> that's the only example i can remember off the top of my head, but there is some other syntactic sugar involved with case statements that are nice
19:00:46 <cl1dev> like i said my exposure was breif
19:01:00 <cl1dev> templates are native to the language
19:01:21 <cl1dev> its not a hack-in after the fact like in C++
19:02:46 <Riastradh> He always forgets to eta-reduce!
19:04:35 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: Templates in C++ aren't an after-thought.
19:04:44 <Pseudonym> They were intended to be there from the beginning.
19:04:57 <Riastradh> They were just done horribly.
19:05:06 <Pseudonym> Yeah, people do ugly things with them, but I think it's wrong to call them "a hack-in after the fact".
19:05:09 <cl1dev> Riastradh: eta reduce?
19:05:26 <Riastradh> cl1dev, yes -- reduce: '\x -> f x' if x is not free in x to 'f'
19:05:28 <Pseudonym> @foldoc "eta conversion"
19:05:29 <lambdabot> *** "eta conversion" foldoc "The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02)"
19:05:29 <lambdabot> eta conversion
19:05:29 <lambdabot>    <theory> In {lambda-calculus}, the eta conversion rule states
19:05:32 <lambdabot>    	\ x . f x  <-->  f
19:05:36 <lambdabot>    provided x does not occur as a {free variable} in f and f is a
19:05:38 <lambdabot> [there's @more]
19:05:53 <Riastradh> @morre
19:05:53 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "morre", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
19:05:54 <Riastradh> @more
19:05:59 <Riastradh> ...
19:06:02 * Riastradh smacks lambdabot.
19:06:07 <cl1dev> heh
19:06:09 <Riastradh> @foldoc "eta conversion"
19:06:10 <lambdabot> *** "eta conversion" foldoc "The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (09 FEB 02)"
19:06:10 <lambdabot> eta conversion
19:06:10 <lambdabot>    <theory> In {lambda-calculus}, the eta conversion rule states
19:06:13 <lambdabot>    	\ x . f x  <-->  f
19:06:17 <lambdabot>    provided x does not occur as a {free variable} in f and f is a
19:06:19 <lambdabot> [there's @more]
19:06:19 <Riastradh> @more
19:06:21 <lambdabot>    function.  Left to right is eta reduction, right to left is
19:06:23 <lambdabot>    eta abstraction (or eta expansion).
19:06:27 <lambdabot>    This conversion is only valid if {bottom} and \ x . bottom are
19:06:29 <lambdabot>    equivalent in all contexts.  They are certainly equivalent
19:06:31 <lambdabot>    when applied to some argument - they both fail to terminate.
19:06:33 <lambdabot>    If we are allowed to force the evaluation of an expression in
19:06:35 <lambdabot>    any other way, e.g. using {seq} in {Miranda} or returning a
19:06:37 <lambdabot>    function as the overall result of a program, then bottom and
19:06:39 <lambdabot> [there's @more]
19:07:02 <cl1dev> @more
19:07:03 <lambdabot>    \ x . bottom will not be equivalent.
19:07:03 <lambdabot>    See also {observational equivalence}, {reduction}.
19:08:21 <cl1dev> is \x "all of x" ?
19:10:32 * cl1dev goes back to his learning
19:10:39 <cl1dev> that made no sense to me at all
19:12:50 <Pseudonym> Ignore the bit about bottom.
19:12:58 <Pseudonym> Basically, it means:
19:13:02 <Pseudonym> sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs
19:13:05 <Pseudonym> is the same as:
19:13:07 <Pseudonym> sum = foldr (+) 0
19:13:23 <Riastradh> Or:
19:13:26 <Riastradh> \syn -> quit syn
19:13:28 <Riastradh> is the same as:
19:13:29 <Riastradh> quit
19:13:32 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:13:39 <Pseudonym> The rest is about getting it right technically.
19:13:43 <cl1dev> oh, reduction, yeah
19:14:09 <cl1dev> like x^2 + 3 = y^2 + 3 can be reduced to x = y
19:14:51 <Riastradh> Well, that's not quite eta-reduction.
19:16:14 <Pseudonym> And it's not true anyway.
19:16:23 <Pseudonym> x = -y
19:16:38 <Pseudonym> Reduction, in lambda calculus, you can think of as an evaluation step.
19:16:50 <Pseudonym> Take, for example:
19:16:54 <Pseudonym> length [] = 0
19:16:57 <Riastradh> Eta-reduction isn't necessarily an evaluation step -- it's more of an optimization step.
19:17:07 <Pseudonym> length (x:xs) = 1 + length xs
19:17:13 <Pseudonym> Uhm... yes.
19:17:14 <Pseudonym> True.
19:17:24 <Riastradh> Beta-reduction is an evaluation step.
19:17:30 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:17:33 <Riastradh> Alpha-conversion isn't reduction but it's also an evaluation step.
19:17:37 <Riastradh> And those are the only two evaluation steps there are.
19:17:41 <cl1dev> |x| = |y|
19:24:19 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: Plus another one for seq. :-)
19:24:33 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, the Lambda-Calculus doesn't have seq.
19:24:54 <Pseudonym> I know.
19:24:59 <Pseudonym> Hence the emoticon.
19:40:01 <kenikov> Everytime I come in here, Riastradh has been talking.  Is he always here?
19:40:16 <shapr> maybe you two are in the same time-zone
19:42:18 <kenikov> Maybe he just sits and chats on IRC all day...
19:42:18 <Riastradh> I'm always here.
19:43:07 <kenikov> Thought so.  I use to always be on IRC, but it was really killing my intelligence and the people on IRC develop these evil characteristics so i stopped.
19:43:32 <shapr> you must have spent all your time on the wrong channels
19:43:49 <Pseudonym> Riastradh is omnipresent.
19:44:04 <cl1dev> correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't the \ or "lambda abstraction" basically mean "regardless of the function name this function ..."
19:44:14 <Pseudonym> Kind of.
19:44:18 <Pseudonym> It's a function without a name.
19:44:28 <Riastradh> Around here your social skills become very weird but your intelligence increases majorly.
19:44:48 <Pseudonym> That's true.  This is one of the smarter channels.
19:44:51 <cl1dev> what are these "social skills" you speak of?
19:44:55 <Pseudonym> If I do say so myself.
19:45:03 <kenikov> shapr: Doubt it. 
19:45:12 <Riastradh> Zigackly, cl1dev.
19:45:27 <S-> heheh
19:45:38 <kenikov> There are always evil people on IRC, wannabe geeks or just...scary people.
19:45:40 <Riastradh> For those of you who actually had them, it doesn't kill them -- it just makes them very weird, like shapr on IRC.
19:45:48 <shapr> I was weird beforehand.
19:46:03 <cl1dev> the problem is that most smart people only appear to be lacking in social skills to the general public when the actual fact is the general public lacks the social skills
19:46:06 <Riastradh> Yes, but I was making the comparison because you're the cause.
19:46:22 <shapr> cause?
19:46:26 <Riastradh> cl1dev, well, it's more that the general public just sucks in general.
19:46:26 <shapr> of weirdness?
19:46:31 <kenikov> clldev: Smart people do not lack social skill.  Morons lack social skill.
19:46:37 <Riastradh> I think so, shapr.
19:46:40 <cl1dev> Riastradh: i was trying to be nice ;)
19:46:56 <shapr> Riastradh: for this channel, you're probably correct
19:47:02 <Riastradh> See?
19:47:08 <Riastradh> He even agrees with me!
19:47:39 * Riastradh was never bouncy before he came here.
19:47:53 <cl1dev> isn't bouncy right now :(
19:47:57 * Riastradh was in fact generally dark, quiet, and stern.
19:48:19 <cl1dev> i just looked at the clock. it's 21:48 here, and my wife hasn't called
19:48:28 <Pseudonym> We're so goddamn smart.
19:48:39 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: Is she also a geek?
19:48:44 <cl1dev> that means i'll prolly cry like a little bitch when i go to bed tonite .. oh well
19:49:00 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: sorta, she wants to learn how to use linux :)
19:49:14 <Pseudonym> My wife can do light system administrative tasks.
19:49:24 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: but she's in basic training for the army, so i don't get to see her right now
19:49:27 <Pseudonym> Like adding users.
19:49:31 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
19:50:01 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: well she will be doing signal communications stuff, lotsa math from what i've heard, its actually part of MI in the army
19:50:13 <cl1dev> so yeah, she's a geek
19:50:23 <Pseudonym> Geeks come in all shapes and sizes.
19:50:26 <Pseudonym> And in all fields.
19:51:12 <shapr> yes
19:51:16 <cl1dev> well she scored high enough on the entry exam that she got to pick any MOS she wanted
19:51:27 <cl1dev> so i think that's proper geek material to me :)
19:51:38 <Pseudonym> Yup. :_)
19:52:58 <kenikov> People on IRC have a bad taste in music too.
19:53:04 <Pseudonym> Definitely.
19:53:28 <cale> http://www.homestarrunner.com/sneakvideo.html
19:53:39 <kenikov> Yeah.  Nobody listens to R&B or Michael Jackson
19:54:02 <shapr> oh, I thought you said *bad* taste
19:54:07 * Riastradh has the only good taste on IRC.
19:55:16 <kenikov> shapr: Oh, how funny! AHAHAHA
19:55:16 * cale listens to mostly jazz, blues and rock&roll.
19:55:18 <kenikov> :|
19:55:44 <kenikov> Michael Jackson is my favorite, then R&B stars like Craig David and early 90's rap.
19:55:57 * Pseudonym doesn't like early 90s rap
19:56:29 <Pseudonym> It's way, way too narcissistic.
19:57:09 <Pseudonym> Earlier rap is about how pathetic you are.
19:57:14 <Pseudonym> Much more postmodern.
19:58:33 <kenikov> Early rap is way better than 2000 rap like Nelly or Ja Rule...so materialistic.
19:58:34 * cl1dev likes this type of music ... http://di.fm/mp3/hardcore128k.pls
19:58:50 <cl1dev> among others of course
19:58:51 * Pseudonym likes this kind: http://goatse.cx/
19:58:54 <cl1dev> heh
19:59:12 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: i dunno, that kinda music is really anal
19:59:19 <shapr> I like 2manydjs
19:59:27 <cl1dev> shapr: here here
19:59:50 <kenikov> I mainly like R&B though.  Destiny Child is really good, Usher too.
20:00:04 * cale likes http://vx.hn.org/autoshare/01-audiotrack.ogg
20:00:14 <kenikov> White people get R&B all mixed up.  This white girl at my school insisted that Usher sang Pop, and when I told her she was an idiot told the teacher.
20:00:30 <cl1dev> shapr: http://www.digitallyimported.com .. they have 11 different types of 2manydj stations to listen to
20:00:49 <cl1dev> usher did sing pop
20:00:51 <cale> Most of what people call R&B these days I wouldn't.
20:01:02 <cl1dev> pop isn't a specific genre
20:01:19 <Pseudonym> No, just like "progressive" isn't.
20:01:45 <kenikov> clidev: Yes it is.  It includes N'Sync, BackStreet boys and 98 disease.
20:01:53 <kenikov> Usher is R&B.  His rhythm is jazzy.
20:01:57 <kenikov> I would know, I play Jazz.
20:01:58 * shapr goes back to coding
20:01:59 * Riastradh blasts Schubert into the channel.
20:02:01 <Pseudonym> Yeah, but "pop" also includes, say, Queen.
20:02:11 * shapr cranks up DaftPunk
20:02:17 <Pseudonym> Even though it's also "glam" and "progressive rock" depending on the song.
20:02:19 <kenikov> I am talking Genre.  Usher sings R&B.
20:02:19 <cl1dev> the pop i listen to doesn't have n'stank backdoor boyz or whatever
20:02:28 <kenikov> I've been listening to him since like 3 years ago.
20:02:39 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: progressive usually means that the song builds
20:03:32 <Riastradh> Take that, you young whippersnappers!  Hear Beethoven and Schubert and Mozart and Bach especially drive out that nasty junk that flows in one whippersnappery ear and out the other!
20:03:54 * cale likes classical music.
20:03:58 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: That's not how I (or rec.music.progressive) use the term.
20:04:02 <kenikov> Riastradh: Yes, this can be found in the $2.00 CD section.
20:04:04 <cale> I used to play clarinet.
20:04:44 * Riastradh used to play the clarinet, too.
20:04:52 <Riastradh> I was rather good at it, too, but I got bored.
20:04:58 * Pseudonym still plays the cello
20:05:02 <cl1dev> Riastradh: that's why i like certain types of trance, the good ones follow from masters like that
20:05:17 * Riastradh sleeps.
20:05:18 * cl1dev plays the guitar, and keyboard/piano
20:05:37 <kenikov> I play the piano and saxophone.  I don't really like Saxophone though, it hurts when you play it.
20:06:06 <cl1dev> kenikov: that's cause your supposed to put it in your mouth. [:^D
20:06:23 <Riastradh> Yeah...noses generally aren't big enough to fit the reeds.
20:06:26 * cl1dev chokes on his soda from laughing
20:06:49 <kenikov> clldev: Seriously though, they hurt.,
20:06:55 * cale imagines a nose-oboe.
20:06:58 <cl1dev> shapr: do you like deep house?
20:06:58 <kenikov> Your mouth gets sour.
20:07:15 <Pseudonym> lunch
20:07:15 <shapr> cl1dev: I dunno, what counts as such?
20:07:20 <shapr> kenikov: do you use Haskell?
20:07:25 <cl1dev> kenikov: i'll take your word for it
20:07:49 <kenikov> clldev: You better!  Stay away from it!  Stay away from Band!
20:07:53 <kenikov> Piano is way better.
20:07:56 <kenikov> shapr: No :(
20:08:00 <cl1dev> shapr: http://www.shoutcast.com/sbin/shoutcast-playlist.pls?rn=2390&file=filename.pls
20:08:01 <shapr> trying to learn Haskell?
20:08:25 <cl1dev> kenikov: i'm better on the guitar, i've been playing for 12 years now
20:08:26 <kenikov> shapr: Yes, I am gaining knowledge of the language but not code.
20:08:33 <cl1dev> band can kiss my ass
20:09:03 <cl1dev> i'm gonna try to take a music production class when i go to college in the spring
20:09:10 <shapr> @fact learning
20:09:10 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
20:09:26 <shapr> kenikov: you could write a plugin for lambdabot, that's a fun and useful way to write some code.
20:09:30 <kenikov> Band is awful.  I missed the Stanley Cup Game 7 because of Band.  I was going Psycho at the concert because I was missing the Game.
20:09:46 <cl1dev> kenikov: that was your choice
20:09:54 <cl1dev> band isn't a required class
20:10:14 * cl1dev took choir in high school
20:10:15 <kenikov> clldev: I didn't know we would be going to another concert on Stanley Cup night and that the music would be so stupid.
20:10:22 <cale> I enjoyed band in highschool - I wish that I'd started earlier.
20:10:35 <kenikov> Our teacher makes us play popular music when we visit Elementary school so he can lure kids in, then he makes us play stupid songs.
20:10:47 <shapr> obviously a music rating plugin would be of interest to you
20:10:47 <kenikov> Literally, they are stupid.  Just upbeats the whole friken song.
20:10:53 <cl1dev> kenikov: well that's what you get for not researching (i.e. asking other students)
20:10:55 <cale> Our band and music class was decent.
20:11:04 * cl1dev has no simpathy for you
20:11:08 <kenikov> Ours was top in State.
20:11:19 <cl1dev> i thought choir was awsome
20:11:28 <kenikov> clldev: I was young and niave.
20:11:47 <kenikov> I can't say Band hasn't helped my grades, knowledge and intelligence though.
20:11:47 <cl1dev> i went to mansfield high
20:11:49 <cl1dev> i left that way too :)
20:12:09 <kenikov> Choir also sucks.  They don't sing enough Michael Jackson.
20:12:38 <kenikov> Would it kill them to sing some R&B ;) ?
20:12:44 * cale orchestrated "Peaches en Regalia" as his OAC music project.
20:12:56 <shapr> kenikov: have you tried Haskore?
20:13:00 <cl1dev> bleh, i love the sound of an a capella choir
20:13:33 <kenikov> Darn, Michael Jackson is always in the POP category in iTunes Music Store.
20:13:47 <kenikov> shapr: No.  I've tried Python.
20:14:13 <shapr> Haskore is a Haskell scoring program
20:14:15 <cl1dev> tried meaning you started reading about it and didn't finish ?
20:14:25 <cale> Haskore is a music description language embedded in Haskell.
20:15:06 <cl1dev> kenikov: i'm just being an ass, becuase i can, and i'm pissed that my wife didn't call today
20:15:16 <cale> (so your Haskore music is written as a Haskell script)
20:15:34 <kenikov> clldev: How old are you?  Like 60?
20:15:38 <cl1dev> kenikov: don't mind me
20:15:44 <cl1dev> kenikov: LOL, no
20:15:48 * cl1dev is 27
20:15:53 <kenikov> Married at 27?
20:16:01 <cl1dev> yeah, for the second time at that
20:16:03 <kenikov> Quote: "Locked down for life" - Tupac Shakur
20:16:28 <kenikov> Nope, not I.
20:17:09 <cl1dev> kenikov: i dunno what i would do with out her, i'm having trouble coping as it is with her being gone
20:17:37 <Pseudonym> Sounds pretty codependent to me.
20:17:47 <cl1dev> *nods*
20:17:56 <kenikov> I don't know what I'd do without my computer.
20:18:05 <kenikov> I'd probably either watch TV or actually do some work.
20:18:09 <kenikov> REAL work.
20:18:20 <clausen> who's "her"?
20:18:32 <cl1dev> clausen: my wife
20:18:32 <kenikov> If it wasn't my computer, I would be finished all my Summer Homework by now, which is just a misealy essay on a book i've already read 2 years ago.
20:18:42 <kenikov> clausen: Me.
20:18:56 <cl1dev> kenikov: funny, the more i sit at the computer, the smarter i get, and the more money i make
20:18:57 <clausen> ah, how nice :)
20:19:02 <shapr> yah, same for me
20:19:24 <kenikov> clldev: The more I sit at the computer, the dumber I get and the dumber I realize I am.  But the people who surrond me on IRC make me feel so much more confident :).
20:19:28 <cl1dev> i made over 1000 bux last week sitting in front of the computer
20:19:48 <cl1dev> doing edi in javascript .. LOL
20:20:05 <kenikov> I wish I could be better at the Science of Computers.  I am pretty good but I am better at like Astronomy or Biology.
20:20:18 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: You get money for IRCing?
20:20:26 <Pseudonym> Damn.
20:20:33 <cl1dev> i'm charging all that money becuase i'm forced to use notepad as my development environment
20:20:45 <Pseudonym> Bloody hell.  
20:20:46 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: i chat at work, if that counts
20:20:48 <kenikov> But I have more lab time than my Science teacher because of my computer.  I just sit and code or play around with stuff on the net.  
20:20:51 <kenikov> I call that "research"
20:20:54 <Pseudonym> Here's a nickel, go buy yourself a real editor.
20:21:00 <cale> cl1dev: you can't even download textpad?
20:21:09 <cl1dev> cale: i can't install crap
20:21:12 <Pseudonym> Both gvim and emacs are available for Win32.
20:21:20 <kenikov> clldev: Did you realize that you are actually getting dumber the more you stare at the computer?  The signals it sends out kills many, many of your brain cells.
20:21:22 <Pseudonym> Hell, even interdev isn't all that bad.
20:21:23 <cale> Pseudonym: that's true, too.
20:21:28 <kenikov> As we all know, Brain Cells don't replenish.
20:21:41 <cale> kenikov: yes they do.
20:21:50 <kenikov> cale: I'm sorry, they don't.
20:22:03 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: yeah i went to all the trouble to install emacs, and found out that i couldn't install it just because i don't have write access to the regestry
20:22:13 <cl1dev> kenikov: yes they do
20:22:36 <cl1dev> kenikov: its just more slowly than most other cells
20:23:05 <kenikov> clldev: No, I'm sorry.  Doctors and Science teachers have told me they don't.
20:23:26 <cl1dev> kenikov: well then no wonder your getting dumber, you have stupid people teaching you
20:23:53 <cl1dev> i have a neuroscience book right here that was written by 7 doctors and it says otherwise
20:23:55 <cale> It was believed for quite a while that no new brain cells were formed after birth, but that was later shown to be false.
20:23:57 <Pseudonym> cl1dev: I'm glad you make a lot of money, because I couldn't handle the cognitive dissonance of being forced to program without decent tools for insufficient reward.
20:24:17 <kenikov> clldev: I have talked to many doctors that say the opposite.
20:24:57 <cl1dev> kenikov: i don't care, its a fact not an opinion that nerve cells replenish
20:25:17 <kenikov> clldev: Yes, and your book's writer's opinions don't matter.
20:25:22 <kenikov> I am asking a doctor right now on IM.
20:25:41 <shapr> cl1dev is right according to what I've read.
20:25:52 <kenikov> shapr: Read some more.
20:26:07 <kenikov> He's wrong according to what I've read
20:26:15 <shapr> kenikov: get a subscription to sciencenews.org, you'd be amazed what you learn each week.
20:26:34 <kenikov> shapr: I don't read those.  I read Scientific American and Popular Science.
20:26:41 <cale> http://www.skally.net/ppsc/nerve.html
20:29:49 <kenikov> cale: That site looks like a 12-year old made it.
20:30:15 <cale> It's text from SA - besides, there are suitable references.
20:32:32 <cale> NEUROGENESIS IN THE ADULT HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS, Peter S. Eriksson et al. In Nature Medicine, Vol. 4, No 11, Pages 1313-1317; November 1998.
20:32:32 <cale> is probably the one you're looking for.
20:32:46 <cl1dev> holy cow, nerve cells not only grow but they shrink as well, it depends on the amount of NGF present in that region
20:34:27 <cl1dev> oh, that's just neurites from the ganlion cells, nevermind
20:36:41 <kenikov> heh, my cousin on IM is getting all mad at me because I blame china for SARS.
20:36:48 <kenikov> (he's from HK)
20:39:23 <shapr> there goes a person with strong opinions.
20:40:02 <Pseudonym> I believe people should have strong opinions.  Anyone else is a moron.
20:40:08 <shapr> I agree :-)
20:40:32 * clausen is a moron
20:40:35 <shapr> there is such a thing as too strong though
20:40:37 <cale> I think people should have strong opinions, but not so strong that they can't change their minds.
20:40:52 <Pseudonym> Yes, I agree.
20:41:02 <Pseudonym> Strong opinions are important.  Especially for programmers.
20:41:11 <Pseudonym> We need to care about our craft enough to have strong opinions.
20:43:08 <cl1dev> you know that all cells start out as neurons and become what they are due to chemicals and cell interaction in the local environment?
20:43:28 <shapr> I think all cells start out as stem cells
20:43:34 <shapr> that's what I've read
20:43:58 <cl1dev> shapr: that's what a neruon is
20:44:13 <Pseudonym> Is it?
20:44:29 <cale> I'm not so sure about that.
20:44:42 <Pseudonym> I thought a neuron needs a certain structure in order to be able to transmit signals.
20:44:58 <Pseudonym> I would have thought that a neuron at the very least needs two ends.
20:45:04 <Pseudonym> An input end and an output end.
20:45:13 <cl1dev> Pseudonym: nope, some neurons don't have dendrites
20:45:22 <cl1dev> dendrites are the inputs
20:45:24 <Pseudonym> Not dendrites necessarily.
20:45:37 <Pseudonym> As in, they needn't _look_ like dendrites.
20:45:55 <Pseudonym> Do you have an example of neurons without dendrites?  (I believe this much, I'm just interested.)
20:48:10 <cl1dev> well it looks like the neurons in the mesencephalic nucleus of the cranila nerve V doesn't have any from this picture
20:48:32 <cl1dev> and it says that the retinal amacrine cell doesn't have any axons
20:49:05 <Pseudonym> What do they do if they don't transmit anything?
20:49:15 <Pseudonym> I guess some cells would be transducers.
20:49:21 <Pseudonym> Input only or output only.
20:51:07 <cl1dev> the dendrites are just connections for input, it says here that if it doesn't have any dendrites then there are usualy only one or 2 other cells connected to it
20:51:33 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
20:51:41 <Pseudonym> OK, so dendrites are just for multiplexing.
20:51:47 <cl1dev> appears so
20:51:48 <Pseudonym> That makes sense.
20:52:18 <Pseudonym> I still don't buy that these are stem cells.
20:52:42 <Pseudonym> How is a neuron defined?
20:52:48 <Pseudonym> What makes a cell a neuron or non-neuron?
20:53:25 <cl1dev> ok, stem cells aren't neurons, BUT if stem cells are unaffected by their environment, they turn into neurons
20:53:36 <cl1dev> stem cells are baby neurons in other words
20:53:53 <clausen> I think pseudonym meant from a classification POV
20:54:02 <cl1dev> stem cells send electric signals
20:54:05 <clausen> (not how a cell turns into a neuron cell)
20:55:39 <Pseudonym> OK, that I'll buy.
20:55:45 <cl1dev> stem cells form the precursor for the spinal cord which then extends upwards and becomes the brain
20:55:55 <Pseudonym> Stem cells become neurons all other things being equal.
20:56:10 <Pseudonym> And yes, I did mean from a classification POV.
20:56:11 <cl1dev> that spot where the spinal cord is where all growth of a human starts
20:56:49 <cl1dev> s/is/is, is/
20:56:54 <Pseudonym> Morphogenesis is interesting.
20:57:03 <Pseudonym> Alan Turing did a lot of research on this topic.
20:57:22 <cl1dev> i learnt all of that in a few days
20:57:58 <cl1dev> its amazing what other's research can do for you :)
20:58:57 <cl1dev> the whole reason i got into this neuroscience stuff was becuase i was researching ANN's
21:00:30 <cl1dev> i WAS tired, now i'm not. i got all excited about this neuroscience stuff and now i'm wired again
21:02:39 <shapr> neurologically wired
21:07:20 <cl1dev> heh
21:07:59 <cl1dev> i think some people get dumber when they are around me becuase i obtain their intelligence through osmosis :)
21:30:14 <Pseudonym> You need fewer dendrites.
22:00:07 * shapr fights the system
22:01:50 <Pseudonym> Rage Against The Compiler
22:01:56 <shapr> yah
23:06:31 * shapr shaboings
23:06:42 * shapr throws combinators
23:31:01 <cale> heh
23:33:06 <cale> That'd be cool, if there were these real physical combinators that you could throw and they would shuffle around the things they hit, turning them into some combination of themselves.
23:33:35 <shapr> lego :-)
23:34:14 <shapr> I've often wondered why Lego and Heathkit haven't joined forces to make a build-your-own-LEGO-radio kit
23:40:14 * shapr blinks
23:40:17 <shapr> hi andersca 
23:40:29 * andersca yawns
23:41:30 <andersca> morning shapr
23:45:16 <Pseudonym> Blerg.
23:45:21 <shapr> that's what I was thinking
23:45:36 <shapr> maybe more towarsd argh
23:45:37 <Pseudonym> Ever tried to walk through fdisk with someone over the phone?
23:45:44 <andersca> yep
23:45:47 <shapr> yep
23:45:47 <andersca> win95 fdisk
23:45:55 <Pseudonym> Good, it's not just me then.
23:46:12 <Pseudonym> It's a special kind of frustration.
23:46:15 <andersca> we're all geeks here
23:46:24 <shapr> were there some math bugs specific to ghc5.04.2 ?
23:47:12 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
23:48:38 <Marvin--> morning
23:48:39 <andersca> godmorgon Marvin--
