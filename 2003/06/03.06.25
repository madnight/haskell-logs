00:07:42 <Pseudonym> Marvin: We'll see what people think.
01:49:21 <Marvin--> http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2002/20020304l.gif   riiight, that's much clearer
01:51:42 <cale> heh
04:58:53 * shapr does the good morning dance
04:59:04 <shapr> goood morning #haskell!
04:59:08 <Marvin--> down here in Göteborg, it's afternoon :-/
04:59:41 <shapr> it's amazing what 800km can do to the time of day.
04:59:56 <Riastradh> It's too early for me...I somehow woke up at 0545 and I haven't been able to sleep any more since.
05:00:15 <shapr> it's @541
05:00:43 <Igloo> Hey ho
05:01:04 <shapr> hiii Igloo!
05:01:07 * shapr boings
05:01:36 <shapr> so, what's up?
05:02:16 * shapr checks HaWiki
05:02:34 * andersca bounces
05:02:41 <Igloo> ghc6 debs in incoming at last  :-)
05:02:51 <shapr> yay!
05:02:54 * shapr updates
05:03:17 <shapr> oh, I haven't tried Heffalump's arrow debs yet
05:03:38 <shapr> Is there some way to stick the arrow preproc into hmake or ghc somewhat automatically?
05:03:49 <Marvin--> -farrows in cvs?
05:03:55 <Igloo> CVS GHC just had the arrow desugaring stuff merged
05:03:59 <shapr> cool
05:04:14 <shapr> when do you think that'll reach debs?
05:04:37 <shapr> Of course, I'm thrilled that ghc6 debs exist already...
05:04:58 <Igloo> Shouldn't be too hard, but I don't think I have time today
05:05:23 <Igloo> Oh, and last I remember CVS wasn't building anyway
05:05:40 <shapr> sometime in the next week would be amazing to me.
05:06:05 <shapr> I'm used to dealing with EU projects, where it takes six weeks to plan the plan :-)
05:06:17 <Igloo> :-)
05:06:25 <Igloo> EU as in European Union?
05:06:44 <shapr> yup
05:07:02 <shapr> oh, I think we're going to get another one in the next few weeks.
05:07:05 * shapr dances happily
05:07:28 <Igloo> Cool
05:08:15 <shapr> Igloo: do you have any inside info on the next ghc enhancements?
05:08:27 <shapr> just curious where it's going
05:08:38 <Igloo> It's all on cvs-ghc@haskell.org  :-)
05:08:42 * shapr subscribes
05:09:13 <Igloo> cvs-all might be better - it gets the cvs-ghc stuff as well as most of the other cvs-* lists
05:09:33 <Igloo> The arrows stuff and TH changes are the only big things I can remember
05:10:58 <shapr> ok, I'll try that.
05:24:11 * cale is writing an aliases / variables / functions plugin for X-Chat in perl which allows one to write aliases and functions for X-Chat in a sickening blend of perl and special pattern matches.
05:25:24 <cale>  /alias map /seval foreach $a (qw( #&3 )) { IRC::command "#%2 $a" }
05:26:17 <Riastradh> Implement a Haskell plugin in XChat!
05:26:31 <Marvin--> cale: you're right, that's sickening
05:26:41 * Marvin-- wanders off in search for more coffee
05:27:09 <shapr> yah, Haskell plugin for XChat :-)
05:27:11 <shapr> or try hircules
05:27:13 <cale> A haskell plugin would be nice actually.
05:27:23 <Riastradh> Write it!
05:27:55 <shapr> oh, I haven't tried building hircules with ghc6
05:28:02 * cale ponders implementation strategy...
05:28:37 <Marvin--> no QuotesPage updates for a while, dang
05:28:41 <Riastradh> Embed Hugs with a few foreign functions and some wrapper stuff.
05:32:13 <cale> hmm... I suppose that when the plugin starts up it can run hugs, and open a couple of pipes to communicate with it, then the commands would just be sending strings to hugs and reading off the response.
05:34:13 <cale> actually, I might want to make that ghci, as I its repl is a bit more featured.
05:35:01 <Riastradh> I would imagine Hugs would be both faster and easier to embed in XChat (a C program), considering that it's written in C.
05:36:18 <Riastradh> You don't need a very featured REPL -- it just needs to be able to load modules and interpret function calls.
05:37:08 <cale> hmm, that's true I suppose.
05:38:49 <cale> It doesn't really help me that hugs or X-Chat is written in C, since I'm probably not going to implement a low-level plugin model here, just an interface to hugs (which I'll probably code in perl, as I'm not all that familiar with python).
05:39:31 <Riastradh> Yuck, no, do a real plugin.
05:39:45 <Riastradh> Avoid Perl at all costs.
05:40:08 <cale> hrm. I wonder if there's good documentation on how to do that.
05:41:04 <Riastradh> Probably.
05:41:17 <Riastradh> Or, if not, the source code might be decent documentation itself.
05:42:09 <cale> Hrm, only documentation for version 1.2 exists (and I'm using 2.0.1)
05:42:26 <Riastradh> I don't think it would be that different.
05:42:29 <cale> I'll see how much of it is relevant and if I can hack something basic together.
05:47:27 <steveh> python is great
05:50:52 <cale> yeah, I've been looking at python a bit recently, but I haven't really tried it yet.
05:51:46 * Riastradh doesn't particularly like Python.
05:51:58 <jlouis> me neither
05:52:14 <steveh> Riastradh: well, it strikes a nice balance between perl's ubiquity and ruby's sophistication
05:53:10 * Riastradh doesn't like either of those.
05:53:27 <steveh> Riastradh: what do you use as a scripting language?
05:53:42 <Riastradh> Scripting what?
05:53:48 <steveh> anything
05:53:51 <steveh> system level tasks
05:54:04 <Riastradh> Generally either bash/zsh (if it's simple) or scsh.
05:55:50 <steveh> I like the scripting languages because they can be applied as systems scripting languages, web scripting languages, rapid development languages, etc. with a minimum of  hassle in switching
05:56:17 <steveh> but I suppose if you are a master schemer then something like scsh would be better
05:56:18 <steveh> :)
05:56:29 * Riastradh would always use Scheme for any web programming he ever do.
05:57:01 <Marvin--> careful with the "scripting" word, we're building a big application client/server system thingy in python
05:57:50 <Riastradh> Marvin, I don't think he's saying 'Python is a scripting language' but rather 'I like using Python -as- a scripting language.'
05:58:05 <steveh> Marvin--: well sure, it's good for a lot of things, but I find myself using it most for scripting
05:58:08 <steveh> Riastradh: exactly
05:58:15 <shapr> what is scripting exactly?
05:58:35 * steveh is not using it in a big development project because he has no big development projects on the table :-/
05:58:38 <Riastradh> I'm not entirely sure.  But it's definitely not something you'd do in C.
05:58:49 <Riastradh> ...unless you were a complete fool.
05:59:03 <shapr> I've written decent sized applications in Jython, and in Java, were either of those scripting?
05:59:40 <cale> I generally consider something scripting if its intended means of use is interpreting the program source at runtime.
05:59:46 <steveh> generally a scripting language is dynamically typed, interpreted, etc.
06:00:04 <jlouis> You will utterly fail if try to define what a scripting language is
06:00:19 <steveh> but these are rules of thumb. basically you are using a scripting language when you are writing scripts, and a programming language when you are writing programs :)
06:00:22 <shapr> what about Self? Self is both interpreted and compiled at runtime
06:00:35 <Riastradh> jlouis, yeah...just like what an 'object-oriented' language is.
06:01:15 <steveh> "object-oriented" is much more well-defined than "scripting"
06:01:24 <steveh> still not clearcut but better
06:01:28 <shapr> each method call in Self is runtime compiled for each combination of argument types, giving you interpreted speed the the first time you call the method with that combination of types, but compiled speed afterwards.
06:01:47 <shapr> what makes a script different from a program?
06:01:55 <shapr> run-once versus run-many?
06:01:59 <Riastradh> Scripts -are- programs.
06:02:01 <cale> shapr: nothing.
06:02:20 <Riastradh> The set of scripts is a subset of the set of programs.
06:02:29 <steveh> I will call Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and a few others "scripting languages" due to tradition but of course they are not only used for scripting
06:02:37 <cale> What makes some things fuzzy, and others furry?
06:02:49 <Riastradh> cale, well, fur isn't necessarily fuzzy.
06:02:54 <shapr> fuzzy is short stiff hairs, furry is longer softer hairs.
06:03:03 <cale> but it's all hairs.
06:03:07 <shapr> that's true.
06:03:12 <Riastradh> No, fur is generally a superset of fuzz.
06:03:22 <Riastradh> And fuzz isn't necessarily stiff.
06:03:34 <shapr> so maybe program is the superset like hair, but scripting has a different antonym
06:03:36 <Riastradh> Kittens are fuzzballs, and their fur is generally pretty soft.
06:04:01 <Marvin--> and what about fuzzy logic?
06:04:13 <shapr> short stiff theorems?
06:04:26 <Marvin--> maybe furry logic would be more fun
06:04:28 <shapr> unlike furry logic, which is what my cat thinks with.
06:04:38 <Marvin--> now, all logic is fussy though
06:04:41 * shapr grins
06:04:47 <shapr> @yow
06:04:49 <lambdabot> Will this never-ending series of PLEASURABLE EVENTS never cease?
06:04:55 <shapr> @fortune
06:04:56 <lambdabot> BOFH excuse #258:
06:04:56 <lambdabot> That's easy to fix, but I can't be bothered.
06:05:09 <cale> Scripting is just a qualitative term applied to some programs that are usually quick to write, fairly small (we hope), run in an interpreted language, and often (but not always) perform system and text-processing tasks.
06:05:38 <cale> oops, that usually should map over the following list
06:05:44 <shapr> I wrote a small haskell program to turn some xml into some other xml, but I think it was scripting.
06:06:17 <cale> Haskell sources are called scripts by some people :)
06:06:25 <shapr> and yet, they're compiled
06:06:37 <cale> or interpreted.
06:06:42 <shapr> true
06:06:50 <Marvin--> aren't there C interpreters too?
06:06:54 <shapr> yes, there are
06:06:55 <Riastradh> Yup.
06:07:03 <Riastradh> Even C++ interpreters.
06:07:08 <cale> Perl can be compiled and it's about as "scripting" as you can get.
06:07:11 <Marvin--> yuck
06:07:26 <shapr> Perl is a bit too prescriptive for me.
06:07:28 <tez> @scripting
06:07:29 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "scripting", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
06:07:33 * shapr makes bad puns
06:07:33 <tez> damn
06:07:37 <tez> :)
06:07:44 <cale> (apart from perhaps sh and variants)
06:08:12 <shapr> tic_: are you in Skåne?
06:08:24 <shapr> I wonder if skanova is in Skåne
06:08:44 <andersca> no
06:08:57 <shapr> oh, ok
06:09:01 <andersca> skanova is a network company pretty much
06:09:03 <cale> one thing I just noticed about scripting languages is that they tend to have shorthand, somewhat ad-hoc notations to ease common tasks.
06:09:33 <shapr> like what?
06:10:07 <cale> Like most anything that perl has :) I suppose python has that sprintf operator.
06:10:40 <shapr> a sprintf operator?
06:10:43 <Strike> that's not so much to "ease common tasks" as it is to make string creation faster (using + to concatenate strings is very slow)
06:10:45 <Riastradh> The % thing.
06:10:48 <Strike> shapr: %, I assume
06:10:58 <shapr> hmm
06:11:35 <cale> Possibly, but it sure makes string formatting easy at the same time.
06:12:07 <shapr> how would you compare that to shows in haskell?
06:12:36 <cale> It's not very similar, if I recall how it worked.
06:13:26 <cale> You could do something like "#%02x%02x%02x" % (r,g,b) and get an html colour code, if I remember how it worked.
06:13:39 <Strike> yeah, that looks about right
06:14:04 <shapr> isn't there a sprintf in Haskell now?
06:14:18 <Strike> >>> (red, green, blue) = (255, 255, 255)
06:14:19 <Strike> >>> "#%02x%02x%02x" % (red, green, blue)
06:14:19 <Strike> '#ffffff'
06:14:38 <steveh> cale: in python the operator % handles formatting :)
06:15:16 <steveh> oops, teach me to scroll back :-P
06:15:27 <cale> :)
06:17:04 <cale> It's sort of a nice, somewhat less flexible dual to regular expressions.
06:17:37 <cale> (of course, I'm using dual loosely here)
06:18:36 <Riastradh> shapr, it would be kind of difficult, considering the type system.
06:19:05 <shapr> couldn't it be done with Template Haskell?
06:19:15 <cale> I think there might have been a template version
06:19:27 <cale> That's one of the examples of TH I remember seeing.
06:19:41 <shapr> http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/Printf/
06:21:28 <shapr> what other ad-hoc operators do scripting languages have?
06:21:44 <shapr> I wonder if the Perl ~= operator would be doable in Haskell
06:21:50 * shapr thinks "import Perl"
06:21:57 <cale> Haskerl :)
06:22:09 <shapr> that's been done, hasn't it?
06:22:21 <cale> I think there was some work on it.
06:22:29 <Riastradh> shapr, probably not -- ~= mutates.
06:22:46 <cale> =~ actually :)
06:22:49 <Riastradh> Er, no, that's =~>
06:22:50 <shapr> oh, right
06:22:54 <Riastradh> s/>/./1
06:23:21 <shapr> hm the sharp object operator just mutilates O==|----->
06:23:27 * shapr hacks
06:24:04 <cale> Perl 6 looks like it might be cool. Lots of stuff seems cleaned up.
06:24:23 <Riastradh> Perl 6 looks like it may be cool, but it will never actually happen.
06:24:45 <Riastradh> Er, may look like it be cool, that is.
06:25:02 <cale> Riastradh: why? as in it won't be cool or it won't get finished?
06:25:12 <Riastradh> It won't get finished.
06:25:17 <cale> why is that?
06:25:42 <cale> They seem to be moving along.
06:25:46 <Riastradh> They're proposing so many attempts at fixes, so many new things, so many outlandish implementation extensions, et cetera.
06:26:31 <cale> so it'll get designed and then nobody will want to write a compiler for it?
06:27:33 <Riastradh> No, they're just going to be attempting to work on it and throwing out random code because new ideas won't work with it or throwing out random ideas because certain code in Python or Tcl due to Parrot won't work or stuff like that.
06:28:54 <Riastradh> It's way too ambitious for a way too obfuscated entity.
06:31:45 <cale> Perl seems a whole lot like English to me in some ways.
06:32:45 <shapr> written by a linguist
06:32:46 <Riastradh> Yup -- English is terrifically bloated and badly designed, too!
06:33:19 <jlouis> Riastradh: agreed
06:33:22 <shapr> polli: helloooo
06:33:23 <cale> yeah, but it's those same features in both cases that make the two languages interesting.
06:33:35 * Riastradh doesn't find Perl particularly interesting.
06:33:42 <Riastradh> Although there are some things about English I find interesting.
06:33:46 <cale> For example in English, punning.
06:33:52 <shapr> I'm really fond of languages that build up from a simple base to complex structures
06:34:07 <Riastradh> e.g., Scheme!
06:34:07 <cale> I don't really mean mathematically interesting.
06:34:08 <shapr> punning works in programming languages also
06:34:20 <shapr> isn't that polymorphism?
06:34:21 <Riastradh> Uh oh.
06:34:33 * Riastradh fears cale is going to go off and try to make puns in Perl.
06:34:40 <cale> heh
06:34:52 <cale> don't worry about it - I've had enough perl for today anyway
06:35:42 <cale> gah, but if I want to implement that hugs plugin, I'm going to have to involve myself in C hackery.
06:35:45 <shapr> wow, cool, one of the swedish provinces is named Ångermanland.
06:35:53 <Riastradh> Heh.
06:37:48 <shapr> reminds of dark, saying he was in Göteborg, and he saw a big bright red trolley zooming down the hill at him with ANGER in big letters on the front.
06:38:04 <Riastradh> What does it mean in Swedish?
06:38:30 <shapr> it's a part of Göteburg, a neighborhood
06:38:52 <Riastradh> It's just a name that doesn't mean anything?
06:39:01 <shapr> I don't know
06:39:32 <SyntaxPolice> good morning all
06:39:46 * shapr writes the story of a foreigner in Sweden "A Streetcar named Ånger"
06:39:52 <shapr> goood morning SyntaxPolice!
06:40:28 <shapr> Riastradh: seems that ånger means "regret" in swedish. 
06:41:01 <Riastradh> Regret?  Why would they name a neighbourhood 'regret?'
06:41:20 * shapr dunno
06:41:39 <shapr> I have discovered that ScannedInAvians aren't really westerners, and they're not easterners either.
06:41:42 <Marvin--> Angered, not Anger or Ånger
06:41:44 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: does that word sound anything like the english word Anger?
06:41:52 <shapr> They're from a whole different cultural root.
06:42:38 <shapr> Someone asked me recently how we celebrate midsummer's day in the USA.
06:43:02 <SyntaxPolice> did you tell them about the 4th of july? thats our only real summer festival
06:43:16 <Riastradh> What about getting out from school?
06:43:36 <shapr> on the other hand, they have holidays here that I haven't heard of before
06:43:38 <SyntaxPolice> once when I was at a 4th of july fireworks show, the truck ignited and the fireworks just went on and on for about 10 minutes and then stopped
06:43:58 <shapr> one recently where all the kids dress up as witches, some grown women dress up as jesters or something.
06:44:00 <SyntaxPolice> Riastradh: hm. I"ve never formally celebrated getting out of school
06:44:34 <Marvin--> yeah we do have some heathen holidays still, they're not all christian :)
06:44:35 <shapr> If only we'd known about the witch holiday beforehand, we would have opened our company (webwitches.com) on that day :-)
06:45:02 <shapr> our company is something like webbhexen in swedish, I think.
06:46:26 <shapr> sometimes I feel like a country hick having a non-stop decade-spanning european adventure =)
06:47:02 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
06:47:06 <shapr> so, any new code today?
06:47:23 * SyntaxPolice notes that he's from ohio and is visiting sweden soon
06:47:30 <shapr> yay!
06:47:44 <shapr> so SyntaxPolice, think you'll have time to drop by and write Haskell with me? ;-)
06:47:45 <SyntaxPolice> hm. I discovered that gcc 3.0.4 also is broken w/ ghc6
06:47:49 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: definitely
06:47:57 <shapr> cool, when do you want to show up?
06:48:19 <SyntaxPolice> hm. I'll email you in a minute
06:48:21 <shapr> spiffy
06:48:24 <Marvin--> shapr: webbhäxor
06:48:29 <shapr> oh right
06:48:31 <shapr> that's far niftier
06:48:41 <Marvin--> hexen is German, I think :)
06:48:47 <shapr> yah, you're right
06:49:22 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: ooh, you coming to Sweden?
06:49:23 <shapr> jag är en webbhäxor!
06:49:34 <Marvin--> shapr: nej, du är en webbhäxa
06:49:39 <Marvin--> häxa-häxor
06:49:46 <shapr> oh, ok
06:49:53 <shapr> h4x0r
06:50:09 <shapr> v1 4r w3bbh4x0r
06:50:16 * Marvin-- groans
06:50:20 * shapr snickers
06:50:29 * Riastradh gets the 'haxor' bit of that but nothing more.
06:50:50 <shapr> we are webwitches == v1 4r w3bbh4x0r
06:52:06 * Marvin-- drools some more over War3x
06:52:15 <shapr> next week =)
06:52:33 <shapr> I'm taking vacation on wednesday so I can play frozen throne all day
06:52:51 <Marvin--> er, tradition doesn't have it until the 4th
06:52:58 <shapr> hm
06:53:15 <Marvin--> have you read the entry on gameplay improvements in http://www.blizzard.com/war3x/faq.shtml ?
06:53:20 <shapr> no
06:53:22 * shapr reads
06:53:26 <Marvin--> lots of nifty things
06:53:30 <Marvin--> but they increased the food cap :-/
06:53:49 <Marvin--> it's 50/80/100 instead
06:54:14 <Marvin--> also, http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2002/20020715l.gif ;-)
06:56:46 <shapr> yay, food cap increase is great
06:56:55 <shapr> that'll decrease the usefulness of gargoyles though
06:57:32 <Marvin--> ?
06:57:48 <Marvin--> how much food do they use?
06:57:52 <shapr> 2
06:58:04 <shapr> for the damage they do, they're very cheap on food
06:58:12 <shapr> compare the frost wyrm with 7
06:58:15 <Marvin--> hmm, interesting
06:58:30 <shapr> the difference being that frost wyrms have many hit points and much armor
06:58:34 <shapr> and gargoyles have very little
06:58:52 <Marvin--> they have stone form though
06:58:57 <shapr> also, frost wyrms aren't much more expensive gold-wise than frost wyrms
06:59:09 <shapr> yup, they have stone form, which is even better with unholy aura
06:59:59 <shapr> even so, they die really easily
07:00:27 <Marvin--> looking at the armor/weapon tables it looks like they're awesome magician killers
07:01:24 <shapr> Marvin--: strategy idea: two players on one team, one player doesn't build units, the other undead doesn't build home bases. 'support' player stays at no upkeep so he gets +10 from gold mines, and dumps cash to the undead player who builds lots of gargoyles
07:01:32 * SyntaxPolice wonders about hax0r comments...
07:01:33 <shapr> what do you think?
07:01:36 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: yes! I'm coming to sweden :)
07:02:06 <Marvin--> shapr: except that they have horrible cooldown... 2.2 is even worse than the crypt fiend
07:02:14 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: cool, when, and more precisely where?
07:02:21 <shapr> well, add the lich with frost shield
07:02:38 <shapr> and various stuff to increase attack speed?
07:02:55 <Marvin--> shapr: well, crypt fiends are great magician killers too...
07:03:08 <Marvin--> and probably better at staying alive
07:04:41 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: I'm going to visit shapr for a time, and I"ll be at the Conference. I'm arriving August 14 
07:05:06 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: ah, I hope I can go to the conference too
07:05:13 <Marvin--> hm, need someplace cheap to stay
07:05:16 <shapr> me to
07:05:18 <shapr> o
07:05:44 <Marvin--> hey, you work, I'm a poor student
07:05:52 <shapr> I'm a poor worker.
07:07:21 <shapr> Marvin--: well, try the gargoyle thing, I think it might work.
07:07:41 <shapr> they don't do as much ground damage as the crypt fiend, but they do much more air damage
07:09:03 <Marvin--> sure, but people rarely go up in the air because there are mean air unit killers, for example the gargoyle... obviously I build gargoyles when someone's going up in the air against me
07:09:46 <shapr> and with enough crypt fiends, you don't need air killers
07:09:50 <shapr> since they have web
07:09:56 <shapr> hmm
07:10:46 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: where in sweden do you live?
07:10:53 <andersca> gÃ¶teborg
07:11:02 <shapr> 2 hours west of the conference
07:11:10 <SyntaxPolice> ahh, not bad.
07:11:23 <SyntaxPolice> so stockholm is southeast of uppsula, right?
07:11:27 <Marvin--> 2 hours west of the conference?!
07:11:57 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: got a good map weblink for me?
07:12:35 <Marvin--> it takes at least four hours by train to go from Göteborg to Uppsala
07:12:48 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: no...
07:13:12 <SyntaxPolice> OK, I'll look by my own poor uneducated american self
07:13:17 <Marvin--> http://www.sna.se/webatlas/700/index.html  cool
07:15:25 <Marvin--> http://www.aura-soma.a.se/foren.medlemskarta.htm <- this map shows you some proportions
07:15:41 <Marvin--> I have no idea what the site is about though :)
07:16:12 <SyntaxPolice> oh, of course! near Torslanda
07:16:31 <Marvin--> ...
07:17:06 <SyntaxPolice> this other map spells it Gothenburg
07:17:25 <SyntaxPolice> or is that another city?
07:17:33 <andersca> same city
07:17:39 <andersca> different spellings
07:17:44 <Marvin--> it's the English name of Göteborg
07:17:57 <SyntaxPolice> Ah OK.
07:18:11 <SyntaxPolice> so how long does it take to get from Stockholm to Uppsula?
07:18:25 <SyntaxPolice> (by public transport)
07:19:00 <Marvin--> 40 minutes by train
07:20:25 <SyntaxPolice> meeting ttyl
07:20:26 * SyntaxPolice &
07:23:20 <Marvin--> I shall definitely have to use more crypt fiends when I play MartinT next time (he plays NE with lots of huntresses and dryads)
07:24:48 <shapr> I'm fond of the corpse throwers, or whatever they're called
07:25:24 <shapr> they do lots of damage to buildings, some damage to units, and they carry corpses for necromancers/ghouls/raise dead
07:25:54 <shapr> have you used cripple or unholy frenzy much?
07:26:14 <Marvin--> no, I'm horribly bad at using magicians
07:26:35 <shapr> the magicians are the strong point of undead imho
07:26:42 <Marvin--> meat wagons have way too high cooldown to be useful against units, IMO
07:26:52 <Marvin--> yeah, I'm going to work on it :)
07:27:02 <shapr> unholy frenzy increases the attack rate of a unit by 75%, but does something like 8 dmg to it each tick
07:27:16 <Marvin--> yeah I know what they do
07:27:23 <shapr> I like to unholy frenzy gargoyles
07:27:29 <Marvin--> problem is, you gotta kill off the enemy dryads before using them
07:27:55 <shapr> is there a good way to kill dryads?
07:28:10 <shapr> I like to have six or more dryads around
07:28:21 <Marvin--> not that i know of, except to use units that do piercing damage
07:28:58 <shapr> carrion swarm and shockwave are good against dryads
07:29:09 <shapr> or ghouls/abominations with vampiric aura
07:29:23 <shapr> oh, that aura doesn't work against dryads or golems, etc
07:30:59 <Marvin--> crypt fiends would need endurance aura... undead + orc would be a nasty combo with all the auras...
07:31:13 <shapr> truly
07:31:33 <shapr> I've been playing random race/hero
07:31:34 <shapr> that's fun
07:34:28 <Marvin--> hmm, actually, I think next time I play MartinT, I'll surprise him and only have a small force of ghouls/abominations to take the damage (he usually aims his dryads at my biggest units to make them slower) and then sneak up with a big bunch of 'fiends and take out his dryads and then go berserk on his huntresses, muahaaha
07:34:39 <Marvin--> (and keep his hero sleeping all the time of course :-)
07:35:42 <shapr> I'm not so impressed with sleep, but I like carrion swarm a lot
07:36:07 <Marvin--> well, I'd go for sleep + carrion swarm since vampiric aura is useless with 'fiends
07:36:18 <shapr> and useless against dryads
07:36:31 <Marvin--> yup, but I mainly use sleep to keep his heroes in check
07:36:55 <shapr> doesn't he attack the hero to wake him up?
07:37:46 <Marvin--> yes, but that means he has to stop focusing on other things, and between attacking the hero and then doing something with the hero again, there's a window where you can often sleep him again
07:39:17 <Marvin--> it's very annoying :)
07:40:05 <shapr> do you use frost nova?
07:42:15 <Marvin--> I've never really liked the lich, I usually go with dread lord + death knight
07:43:06 * shapr agrees
07:43:34 <shapr> frost armor is okay, it slows melee attackers when first cast
07:44:22 <Marvin--> yeah... maybe lich + crypt lord is a nice combo
07:44:48 <shapr> armor the tiny beetles?
07:44:57 <Marvin--> think crypt lord + spiked carapace + frost armor
07:45:05 <shapr> make a tank :-)
07:45:18 <Marvin--> he'll have something like 10+ armor
07:45:39 <shapr> frost armor is plus 3 5 7
07:45:52 <Marvin--> so's the spiked carapace
07:46:06 <Marvin--> but having both heroes at level 5 is slightly unrealistic
07:46:18 <shapr> not in the games I play :-)
07:46:23 <Marvin--> ugh
07:46:41 <shapr> we're pretty fast at creeping
07:46:59 <Marvin--> but since the carrion beetles are permanent, putting frost armor on them could be nifty, yes
07:47:18 <Igloo> Is this WCIII?
07:47:22 <shapr> yup
07:47:24 <Marvin--> well, unless you're playing on a huge map there's only so much creep
07:47:36 * cale changes channel topic to "Warcraft 3"
07:47:37 <shapr> what's huge? six players?
07:47:58 <shapr> my foreground task is to make QuickCheckM tests for lambdabot
07:48:10 <shapr> harder than it looks though
07:48:33 <Marvin--> shapr: yes, six players is huge in my book, I play mostly 1v1 and 2v2
07:48:41 <shapr> oh
07:48:52 <shapr> we never play on maps that small
07:49:01 <Marvin--> playing 1v1 on a 4 player map can be horribly bad since you'll have way too many expansions and way too much creeps
07:49:18 <shapr> I'll try that against a pair of insanes
07:50:03 <Marvin--> lost temple is pretty good on 2v2, but doesn't work for 1v1... my favourite for 1v1 is plunder isle
07:50:27 <Marvin--> (but you can't play against the computer on plunder isle, at least not the 'normal' one, since they only go stand under the dragons and get killed, I haven't understood why yet)
07:50:42 <Marvin--> maybe the insane one does it better
07:50:54 <shapr> the insane one cheats
07:51:06 <Marvin--> how?
07:51:06 <shapr> gets +20 where normal players get +10
07:51:15 <shapr> for both gold and lumber
07:51:17 <Marvin--> ouch
07:51:20 <Marvin--> like SC then
07:51:27 <shapr> has anyone else written QuickCheckM tests?
07:52:46 <Marvin--> hey, doesn't the crypt lord get burrow? :/ both the 'fiend and the carrion beetles get it
07:52:47 <shapr> hi galad
07:53:04 <galad> hi there
07:53:13 <shapr> how's code?
07:54:31 <shapr> I wish the QuickCheckM paper had fully working code I could download.
08:06:22 <Marvin--> if you wonder why this place went all quiet, it's because shapr and I moved our War3 talk to another channel :P
08:06:26 * shapr grins
08:06:42 <shapr> though I still want help on writing QuickCheckM tests if someone knows
08:07:04 <shapr> is there a standard Queue that comes with ghc?
08:21:18 <jlouis> probably
08:21:29 <jlouis> they are easy to make purely functional
08:21:37 <jlouis> unless you want them to be real-time queues
08:22:11 <Igloo> By "real-time" do you mean efficient?
08:24:27 <shapr> actually, I just want to test against the queue mentioned in the QuickCheckM paper
08:24:49 <shapr> empty :: ST s ( Queue s a )
08:24:55 * shapr tries Edison
08:28:48 * shapr boings
08:42:00 <jlouis> Igloo: no, not at all
08:42:07 <jlouis> Igloo: opposed to amortized
08:42:29 <Igloo> I don't follow
08:43:08 <jlouis> Igloo: Normal way of creating a queue is 2 stacks, where you reverse the back-one when the front one becomes empty
08:43:45 <Igloo> Oh, right, so you're basically talking about efficiency of single operations
08:43:52 <jlouis> yup
08:44:04 <jlouis> but the laziness tricks me I think
08:44:12 <jlouis> I am accustomed to strict langugaes
09:07:18 <shapr>  CRITICAL **: file gdk-pixbuf-xlib-render.c: line 296 (gdk_pixbuf_xlib_render_to_drawable_alpha): assertion `src_x >= 0 && src_x + width <= pixbuf->width' failed
09:07:21 <shapr> I wonder what that means.
09:07:56 <Marvin--> broken coordinate?
09:11:31 * shapr dunno
09:12:18 <Igloo> It means that bugs don't get fixed if programs continue after assertions fail
09:13:44 <dennisb> exactly, and in this case the src_x coordinate is outside the pixbuf
09:13:59 <andersca> hey dennisb
09:14:03 <shapr> hej dennisb 
09:15:21 <dennisb> hej
09:16:55 * Igloo gains understanding of my bug and sighs
09:21:14 <Marvin--> with understanding comes bliss...or not
09:21:34 <Igloo> Or suffering in this case  :-)
09:30:39 <Marvin--> yay, snooker on TV
09:39:22 <kosmikus|away> Marvin--: which channel?
09:40:26 <Marvin--> kosmikus|away: eurosport
09:42:40 <Marvin--> "Get larger balls and pens, more pleasure, more satisfaction"
09:42:41 <Marvin--> uhm
09:42:45 <Marvin--> I don't really see how larger pens help
09:43:21 <shapr> easier to write?
09:43:54 <Marvin--> I don't see how that helps
09:44:14 <Marvin--> wonder if these are ball-point pens
09:45:14 <Marvin--> heh, women's snooker games are way shorter than men's snooker games for some reason
09:46:34 <Igloo> No defensive play?
09:47:41 <Marvin--> well, I meant in terms of frames
09:47:49 <Igloo> Oh, right
09:47:54 <Marvin--> this game seems to be best of nine frames
09:48:23 <Igloo> I think the opening rounds of most mens tournaments are about that
09:49:19 <Marvin--> from what I understood, this was some sort of final
09:54:52 <Marvin--> sigh, I will never understand what prompts people to send mails to official Debian mailing lists in anything else than English
09:55:01 * Riastradh thinks he could implement his handle and socket abstraction stuff with monad transformers -- which is what they really are, I suppose.
09:55:14 <Marvin--> except for the lists obviously for other languages that is
10:02:20 <shapr> wikipedia is incredibly spiffy
10:07:08 <Marvin--> right, this contest has generally fewer frames, but still, the men's final is 13 frames...
10:07:17 <Marvin--> so why's the women's just 9?
10:16:58 <SyntaxPolice> hihi
10:23:23 <SyntaxPolice> so whoall is from / in Sweden?  We've got at least Marvin--, shapr, and andersca?
10:24:07 <shapr> and dennisb, tic, ludde, polli, norpan I think
10:24:25 <Riastradh> esap is from Finland...
10:24:51 <SyntaxPolice> wow
10:25:24 <dennisb> and a lot of us are from Gothenburg
10:25:42 <shapr> chalmers has a lot of Haskell activity.
10:26:22 * Igloo looks outnumbered
10:26:27 <Riastradh> d-bug too.
10:46:37 <Marvin--> Igloo: muahaha
10:47:13 <Marvin--> shapr: as if they didn't know *that* :)
10:49:56 * SyntaxPolice bounces
10:50:05 <SyntaxPolice> the club I started a few years ago is holding a state-wide Linux conference
10:50:05 * Riastradh sprounces.
10:50:07 <SyntaxPolice> http://opensource.cis.ohio-state.edu/
10:50:14 * SyntaxPolice is not in charge anymore
10:50:46 <SyntaxPolice> of course, this state is Ohio, not CA, but still...
10:51:59 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: did i meet you at the AFP last year?
10:52:16 <SyntaxPolice> hdaume: probably not, whats AFP? :)
10:52:30 <steveh> SyntaxPolice
10:52:36 <steveh> SyntaxPolice: hey, that's pretty cool
10:52:49 <hdaume> summer school in advanced functional programming...
10:53:19 <SyntaxPolice> hdaume: nope. I wasn't doing any advance functional programming last year :-)
10:54:21 <Marvin--> is SSAFP every year or every other?
10:54:27 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: okay...i met someone from ohio state :)
10:54:27 <Marvin--> or generally when someone feels like having one?
10:54:49 <hdaume> Marvin--: i think the latter, though i think they aim for every 2 years or so (though there were a lot back-to-back)
10:56:32 <SyntaxPolice> hdaume: I'm curious to know who you met from OSU.
11:06:53 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: i don't remember his name
11:08:00 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: oh wait no, nm.  it was Iowa, not Ohio.  :)
11:08:24 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: i hope it's not turning into one of *those* days...
11:21:37 <SyntaxPolice> thats funny.  when I worked on the west coast, people always got Ohio & Iowa mixed up :-)
11:23:23 <esap> D
11:23:33 <hdaume> i think it's a pretty common (yet embarassing!) mistake out here
11:23:43 <hdaume> the irony is that my girlfriend is from Ohio.  i should know the difference :)
11:30:13 <SyntaxPolice> heh. where's she from?
11:39:18 <Riastradh> SyntaxPolice - Ohio!
11:40:46 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: solon
11:41:08 <SyntaxPolice> hm. don't know where that is. must be in the corn.
11:41:10 <SyntaxPolice> ;)
11:42:36 <hdaume> it's a suburb of cleveland
11:43:01 <SyntaxPolice> ah OK. my sister lives up that-o-ways
11:43:41 <MotJuste> hello
11:44:06 <MotJuste> what's goin on here?
11:44:14 <MotJuste> anyone around?
11:44:43 <MotJuste> i see all these names on the side but no talky
11:45:23 <MotJuste> hello hello
11:45:36 <MotJuste> umkay, buh-bye
11:55:31 <SyntaxPolice> wwwaaaaaaiiiiiiiiittttt, MotJuste
11:55:44 <hdaume> SyntaxPolice: i don't think he can hear you :)
11:55:49 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
12:33:57 <vincenz> Hi
12:47:40 <keverets_> vd
12:47:52 <keverets_> sorry... wrong window.
12:49:41 <keverets_> (it was "view download" for mldonkey... perhaps I should write a haskelldonkey)
13:00:36 <shapr> oy
13:01:19 <andersca> hello
13:01:57 <shapr> hi
13:02:34 <shapr> what's up?
13:03:20 <andersca> not much
13:03:23 <andersca> hacking on X
13:14:14 <shapr> lambdabot: aha, you're back!
13:14:14 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
13:14:19 <shapr> hah, that's what they all say.
13:14:25 <shapr> hi pesco 
13:14:29 <pesco> hi shapr
13:14:32 <shapr> what's up?
13:14:55 <pesco> not much, I spent half the day at my local apple store playing with the 17" PowerBook.
13:15:00 <shapr> nifty
13:22:38 <shapr> where do I find a queue that uses the ST monad?
13:23:27 <shapr> the QuickCheckM paper says these queues are implemented in the standard imperative way, but since I've read the FP Algorithms book, I don't really remember what that is...
13:23:48 <hdaume> probably linked lists with iorefs
13:23:53 <hdaume> or strefs :)
13:24:06 <shapr> thanks, I'll try that.
13:25:31 <hdaume> i.e., "data STQueue s a = STNil | STCons { elem: a, head: (STRef s (STQueue s a)), prev: STQueue s a }" or soemthing like that
13:27:41 <hdaume> that should be tail, not head
13:27:57 <Riastradh> s/:/::/g
13:28:07 <hdaume> yeah :)
13:28:10 <shapr> thanks
13:29:02 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: did you ever get Yampa to build?
13:29:09 <shapr> yes, but not HGL
13:29:16 <SyntaxPolice> OK.
13:29:17 <shapr> see my message to the yampa-users list
13:29:23 <SyntaxPolice> yeah, thats why I asked.
13:29:29 <shapr> did you see the response?
13:29:50 <Riastradh> The #scheme ICFP contest team cackles evilly at the #haskell team!
13:30:00 <shapr> the #haskell team cackles back!
13:30:01 <SyntaxPolice> yes, but I don't recall offhand. something like "it'll work sometime, we'll see"
13:30:13 <SyntaxPolice> d00z, we should 0wn their channel
13:30:19 <Riastradh> The #scheme team is already organized!  Hah!
13:30:19 * shapr snickers
13:30:30 <shapr> the #haskell team is organized too :-)
13:30:31 <SyntaxPolice> Riastradh: are you on the #scheme team?
13:30:34 <Riastradh> Completely with one box to work upon, with a CVS server, and stuff!
13:30:38 <Riastradh> SyntaxPolice, yeah, I'm running it.
13:30:45 <shapr> we have a mailing list and cvs box
13:30:46 --- mode: ChanServ set +o SyntaxPolice
13:30:47 <shapr> :-P
13:30:54 <shapr> wow, SyntaxPolice has THE POWER!
13:31:00 <SyntaxPolice> \kick Riastradh
13:31:04 <SyntaxPolice> oops...
13:31:05 * shapr snickers
13:31:14 --- mode: SyntaxPolice set -o SyntaxPolice
13:31:24 <shapr> Riastradh: hah! you have been evilly teased!
13:31:29 <SyntaxPolice> muahahahahha!
13:31:54 <Riastradh> Hah, you fools have been so cowardly that you don't even -COME- to #scheme to boast and tease at me!
13:31:59 <Riastradh> Oh, damn.
13:32:02 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
13:32:08 <shapr> well, if I showed up in #scheme, I'd have to say something on-topic.
13:32:20 <shapr> hi inkedmn 
13:32:22 <Riastradh> shapr, nah, not really.
13:32:26 <shapr> well ok then
13:32:34 <SyntaxPolice> I note that I'm not really qualified for trash-talk since I won't be in the contest :-)
13:35:17 <inkedmn> howdy shapr :)
13:39:52 <steveh> aah, latex gives such nice-looking output :
13:39:53 <steveh> :)
13:47:31 <shapr> so, any QuickCheckM users?
13:53:13 <shapr> oh, this is nifty: http://www.ncc.up.pt/typetool
13:58:41 <cale> yeah, that's pretty cool
13:58:57 <shapr> that guy deserves a T-Shirt
13:59:24 <Riastradh> But...but...the t-shirt I designed is a _Hindley_-Milner t-shirt.
13:59:32 <shapr> good point
13:59:35 <Riastradh> This guy describes the _Damas_-Milner type system.
13:59:40 <shapr> is he confused/
13:59:41 <shapr> ?
13:59:46 <Riastradh> No, I don't think so.
13:59:53 <shapr> what's the difference?
14:00:04 <Riastradh> Milner and Hindley were totally independant; Damas and Milner wrote a big paper on the type system together.
14:00:09 <shapr> oh
14:00:53 <elmex> what is a type system?
14:04:23 <cale> elmex: a type system, or more precisely a type inference system is a way of automatically determining a set of type assignments for variables so that a program will work. Generally the type system tries to find the most general types possible that will work.
14:04:49 <elmex> cale: ok, thanks
14:06:19 <hdaume> random question: is the reason that it generally finds the most general types because we don't do single-module compilation (in general)?  otherwise, wouldn't finding the most specific types be the best way to go?
14:07:15 <elmex> hdaume: yes 
14:07:20 <elmex> ( ;-) )
14:15:11 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: is it the case that you couldn't build HGL from alastair's web site because you couldn't download HSX11?
14:55:00 <Igloo> Has anyone got an untruncated topic?
14:55:23 <Riastradh> Not I.
14:55:34 <Igloo> @help topic
14:55:34 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "help", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
14:55:39 <Riastradh> @listcommands topic
14:55:39 <lambdabot> Module topic provides the following commands: ["topic-tell","topic-cons","topic-snoc","topic-tail","topic-init"]
14:55:45 <Igloo> @topic-tell
14:55:45 <lambdabot> don't know that channel

14:56:07 <Marvin--> untruncated?
14:56:14 <Igloo> Ho humm. The GHC 6 debs bit wants to be removed from the middle, anyway
14:56:25 <Igloo> Marvin: mine ends in the middle of the apt line for the arrow debs
14:56:44 <Marvin--> uhhh, okay
14:56:55 <Marvin--> you want to get rid of the GHC 6.0 debs but nothing else?
14:57:01 <Igloo> Yes
14:57:30 --- topic: set to '["We put the Funk in Funktion","See logs @  http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/","Learning Haskell - http://www.haskell.org/learning.html","ICFP Contest http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/icfpcontest/","ghc rpms: http://haskell.org/~petersen/rpms/ghc/","contact shapr for #haskell ICFP contest team members","arrows preprocessor pre-debs: deb http://urchin.earth.li/~ganesh/apt/ unstable/"]' by Marvin--
14:57:33 <Marvin--> something like that?
14:57:53 <Igloo> Well, I'm not convinced the RPM bit deserves a permanent place in the topic as it'spresumably the permanent location, but as a DD I'm not going to be the one to remove it  :-)
14:58:15 <Igloo> Is that really the whole apt line?
14:58:37 <Marvin--> it's all I had in the topic box
14:59:01 <Marvin--> the terminating slash makes it not look for section
15:00:06 <Igloo> Hm, fair enough. It looked too short to me, and that was corroborated by the missing "]
15:09:57 * Marvin-- swears at the GoT message boards
15:10:03 <hdaume> GoT?
15:10:17 <Marvin--> Game of Thrones
15:10:23 <Marvin--> it's a CCG
15:10:32 <Marvin--> the message boards have no search functionality
15:10:37 <hdaume> okay.  sounds like fun.
15:10:40 <hdaume> what's a CCG?  :)
15:10:44 <Marvin--> which sort of is a must in a rules discussion forum
15:10:49 <Marvin--> oh, sorry, collectible card game
15:10:51 <hdaume> ah
15:10:56 <Marvin--> "like magic"
15:11:01 <hdaume> :)
15:19:55 * Igloo noticed they had them in the local games shop here. Which probably won't surprise you one bit  :-)
15:22:53 <Marvin--> I have no idea how big it is, really
15:23:24 <Marvin--> but FFG had to print up another 1000 boxes of the latest expansion because they were pretty much all sold out when the release day came
15:26:44 <Igloo> I think to my untrained eye it looked like MtG and GoT were the "real" ones, with MtG being bigger, and then there was a pile of stuff like Harry Potter cards
15:29:01 <Marvin--> heh
15:29:09 <Marvin--> lord of the rings and pokemon are both pretty "real" too
15:30:53 <Riastradh> Bah, go INWO!
15:31:44 <Igloo> Are, yes, there was probably LotR too - it was a while ago  :-)   But I'd probably have noticed its absence as I know some people who play it
15:33:26 <Marvin--> at our local ccg shop they pretty much take turns to have LotR and MtG tournaments every Saturday
15:33:48 <Marvin--> so we poor GoT players have to squeeze in if there's room for us when we want to have a tournament :-/
15:45:34 <Marvin--> time to sleep
18:29:46 * Pseudonym yawns
18:32:31 * Riastradh explodes.
18:32:41 <inkedmn> wow, didn't realize LaTeX was so simple...
18:33:02 <inkedmn> and that it could be used to create pdf files
18:33:32 <Pseudonym> LaTeX is simple except for that one figure/table/equation in every paper which needs to go a little bit against the flow.
18:34:43 <inkedmn> hehe
19:08:50 <Igloo> It suffers from some of the TeX design issues that are due to age, too. For example, try doing anything complicated with verbatim text.
19:15:40 <steveh> Igloo: amen :-/
19:16:33 * steveh just used the letter class today instead of busting out word.
19:16:38 <steveh> that worked pretty well
