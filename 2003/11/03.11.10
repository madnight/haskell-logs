00:24:25 <lambdabot> It's strange, but I'm only TRULY ALIVE when I'm covered in POLKA DOTS
00:24:25 <lambdabot>  and TACO SAUCE...
00:24:34 <det> @yow
00:24:34 <lambdabot> Intra-mural sports results are filtering through th' plumbing...
00:24:38 <dark> Bored?
00:24:45 <det> @yow
00:24:46 <lambdabot> My uncle Murray conquered Egypt in 53 B.C.  And I can prove it too!!
00:24:50 <det> What gave it away?
00:25:58 <dark> Talking to the bots doesn't mean you're crazy. But you should worry when you have deep and meaningful conversations with them.
00:27:12 <dark> I'm looking for a good way to decode UTF-8 in Haskell.  Right now my options are to wrap around iconv or write it in Haskell.
00:28:28 <dark> I'd prefer to use other people's code for this, because it's too early to engage my brain :)
00:31:21 <ibid> dark: i think i have something ... or not :)
00:31:23 <ibid> let me check
00:31:52 <dark> There's a yummy-looking unpackCStringUtf8# in GHC.Base, but it's probably too deeply buried to get at safely.
00:31:54 <ibid> yes i do
00:33:58 <Lunar^> dark: What do you mean by "decode" ?
00:35:33 <dark> Lunar^: Convert a sequence of bytes into Char.
00:36:13 <dark> Converting faux Char into real Char is also useful, because a lot of IO primitives pretend to return [Char] when they actually don't do any character set conversion.
00:37:09 <ibid> dark: http://savannah.nongnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/ebba/ebba-h/ebba-unicode/UTF.hs?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
00:37:14 <Lunar^> dark: sure... that's a point where Java lib is better
00:39:51 <dark> ibid: Thanks :)
01:01:47 <Lunar^> This is cool : http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/
01:08:06 <blitznl> Lunar^: very spiffy editor ;) I wonder if something similar is available for non-mac systems.
01:08:57 <Lunar^> blitznl: It seems to depend highly on Objective-C class serialization and on the Rendezvous framework
01:09:28 <Lunar^> blitznl: But I think we could do that... 
01:11:53 <blitznl> Lunar^: I remember something similar being possible with win32 paint and netmeeting ;)
01:16:23 <Lunar^> There's a theorical background here
01:16:36 <Lunar^> http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/sun98operational.html
01:21:24 <blitznl> oldy, but nice
01:23:25 <Lunar^> My next Haskell hobby project perhaps ;)
01:27:37 <blitznl> There are times when I think of one pat project a week; If i only had the time .. 
01:27:48 <Lunar^> hehe
01:27:54 <Lunar^> geeks geeks geeks ;)
02:55:59 <shapr> hi TripleDES 
02:56:06 <TripleDES> morning
02:56:24 <shapr> how's code?
02:56:49 <TripleDES> learning :)
02:57:02 <TripleDES> functional programming is different
02:57:08 <TripleDES> but fun ;)
03:01:13 <shapr> yah, I agree
03:38:49 <shapr> TripleDES: have any questions?
03:39:28 <TripleDES> not yet :)
03:39:37 <TripleDES> thanks
03:42:56 <prologic> *bows*
03:43:33 <shapr> hiya prologic 
03:43:35 <shapr> wassup?
03:43:42 <prologic> heya :)
03:43:50 <prologic> ltns, me's been busy studying
03:43:54 <prologic> got lots of exams coming up
03:44:00 <prologic> wassup with you lot ?
03:44:13 <shapr> I'm still workin on Zope
03:44:18 <prologic> ahh k
03:44:24 <prologic> having fun ?
03:44:37 <shapr> yah, it's better than working on Java
03:44:54 <prologic> lol
03:45:04 <prologic> I couldn't agree more
03:45:46 <shapr> I'm still reading about type theory in my spare time
03:45:56 <shapr> what sort of exams have you got?
03:52:11 <shapr> g'day clausen 
03:52:25 <clausen> hi shapr
03:52:27 <clausen> how's life?
03:52:40 <shapr> workin hard
03:52:42 <shapr> how's yours?
03:54:12 <prologic> eh sorry shapr
03:54:15 <prologic> was talking to my brother
03:54:24 <clausen> likewise working hard...
03:54:25 <prologic> I've got PPL, SQP, Project Management and Ethics exams
03:54:35 <clausen> I just generalized my PageRank Cost-of-Attack Theorem
03:54:43 <prologic> PPL - Programming Paradigms and Languages, the subject you guys have helped me with numerous times with assignments
03:54:50 <prologic> and SQP - Software Quality Principles
03:54:56 <clausen> (relaxing the assumption that the attacker isn't stupid enough to link to other web pages he doesn't want to promote)
03:56:24 <shapr> ah, Jerzy Karczmarczuk is great to read :-)
03:57:11 <shapr> there was someone who wanted to log all of freenode recently to experiment with some sort of google algorithms
03:57:39 <shapr> prologic: I'm sure SQP talks about unit testing, random testing, peer review, right?
03:57:56 <prologic> yep
03:58:01 <prologic> a lot of those sorts of things
03:58:11 <prologic> more about quality software though and quality processes
03:58:16 <prologic> what quality is etc
04:22:54 <det> shapr: he was a dick to me :p
04:51:22 <shapr> det: who was?
04:55:47 <dark> The "slowtime conversations" you get on IRC can be amusing :)
04:56:12 <dark> Reminds me of the joke about the monks who were only allowed to speak once per year.
04:57:38 <prologic> lol
04:58:06 <dark> det might have been talking about Jerzy Karczmarczuk.
04:58:09 <det> shapr: jerezy
05:02:04 <shapr> dark: what's the joke?
05:02:10 <shapr> det: I met him, he's a really cool guy.
05:03:16 <dark> shapr: Okay you asked for it :-)
05:03:28 <Lunar^> det: He's cool, I confirm
05:05:17 <dark> There's this monastery where the monks have all sworn a vow of silence.  They go through life without ever speaking a word -- with one exception, at Christmas.  At the Christmas dinner, one monk may say something.
05:05:38 <shapr> just one monk?
05:05:43 <dark> Yeah, they take turns.
05:06:15 <shapr> ok
05:06:42 <dark> So they work all year, copying Bibles and making beer and stuff, and then at Christmas the monk whose turn it is stands up.  He says, gravely, "This Christmas ham sucks."
05:07:25 <dark> The monks resume eating, and life goes on.  Another year passes.  It's Christmas again, and the next monk stands up. He speaks: "Yeah, it does suck."
05:08:39 <dark> There's another year of monasterial work, and another Christmas dinner.  The next monk says: "Can we have a proper ham next year? This one sucks."
05:09:30 <dark> Another year passes, but the next Christmas is special.  It's the Abbot's turn to speak!  The monks can't gossip about it, of course, but the sense of anticipation is clear.
05:09:41 <shapr> :-)
05:09:55 <shapr> ok...
05:09:59 * shapr waits for the punchline
05:10:05 <dark> So, at the dinner, the Abbot stands up, clears his throat, and declares:
05:10:15 <dark> "Can everyone STOP WHINING about the food? It's driving me crazy!"
05:10:19 <shapr> heh!
05:10:21 <polli> :)
05:10:30 <dark> Proper delivery is difficult over IRC :-)
05:10:52 <shapr> I think you did well.
05:12:14 <shapr> entertained me, for sure
05:12:59 <dark> :-)
05:13:16 <ibid> (of course, in real life such monks used hands to communicate)
05:13:33 <ibid> (not that i didn't enjoy the joke, of course)
05:13:34 <dark> ibid: Sneaky :)
05:14:05 <dark> ibid: Did they have a full sign language? That would seem to go against the spirit :-)
05:14:24 <ibid> i don't know all the details...
05:14:40 <ibid> but i believe they did
05:15:05 <ibid> (spirit? what spirit?  there are only two spirits, one is up in the heaven and the other is in the bottle;)
05:17:05 <ibid> http://www.top.net.nz/~hugh/Vanity/Articles/MonksSL.html
05:18:25 <ibid> http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_038.html
05:24:00 <dark> ibid: Interesting.  Thanks :)
05:48:02 <harsha123> hello all!
05:48:21 <harsha123> hi shapr !
05:51:26 <shapr> bye harsha123
05:56:51 <dark> I'm wondering how dangerous it will be to introduce lazy database queries in my program :)
05:57:06 <shapr> should be at least exciting
05:57:41 <dark> On the one hand they might interfere with the current transaction.  On the other hand they're only queries.  And if I'm preparing a query that depends on them, the lazy evaluation should trigger them first, so it should all work.
06:00:31 <dark> Hmm.  unsafeInterleaveIO still allows chunking of IO actions, right?  The interleaving is only done at unsafeInterleaveIO points.  If I understand getContents right.
06:01:58 <dark> shapr: I noticed that the need to do database queries is ruining the elegance of my haskell code :)
06:02:47 <shapr> yah, I think there's a cure for that, but I haven't figured it out yet.
06:03:04 <dark> I think the cure might be lazy queries :-)
06:03:40 <dark> For example, I can make a lookup_game function that returns a datastructure that will lazily query any additional information (in other tables) as it is needed.
06:06:07 <shapr> will that restore elegance?
06:07:09 <dark> I think so.  It means I won't have to worry ahead of time about which information is needed (i.e. I can rely on laziness again), and I can lose a lot of IOness.
06:07:58 <dark> Doesn't work for everything, of course.  Some stuff needs complicated 30-line queries for efficiency.
06:28:10 <shapr> wheee
06:28:26 <dark> My girlfriend is playing an industrial version of "Oops I did it again".
06:29:51 <shapr> 'industrial version' ??
06:30:33 <dark> Yeah... imagine a gravelly male voice singing it slowly, accompanied by machine noises :)
06:30:39 <shapr> yikes
06:32:30 <dark> Not as impressive as Leibach's rendition of One Vision, though :)
06:33:33 <dark> I didn't realize how fascist all that "one man one goal one mission" stuff sounded until I heard it shouted in German :-)
06:33:40 <shapr> heh
06:38:28 <dark> Heh... mp3.com has several dozen spoofs of Oops :)
06:38:41 <dark> "Oops my AK-47 did it again"
06:39:47 <dark> Found it :) Second song on http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/220/wall.html if you're curious :)
07:12:56 <shapr> dutch bouncing...
07:13:21 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: the folks on #osuoss want to move to denmark, but I'm voting sweden, can we stay with you?
07:13:47 <shapr> hehe
07:14:01 <shapr> well, we can loan you guys two rooms
07:14:37 <shapr> bea says "Hello SyntaxPolice"
07:14:42 <SyntaxPolice> hi bea!
07:14:47 <shapr> why do you guys want to move to Denmark?
07:14:49 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: join #osuoss :)
07:27:01 <isomer> is it just me or is spj really smart?
07:27:31 <shapr> he's really smart.
07:27:36 <shapr> he's also really fun to hang out with.
07:27:40 <isomer> just checking....
07:27:44 <isomer> oh, you've met him?
07:27:58 <shapr> above all, he's really nice, not egotistical, and is just trying to get stuff done.
07:28:06 <shapr> yah, I hung out with him at ICFP.
07:28:10 <isomer> ooooh, cool
07:28:25 <isomer> i just downloaded a bunch of his papers to read while i'm at work :)
07:28:30 <isomer> err....that came out wrong
07:28:36 <shapr> heh
07:28:44 <SyntaxPolice> speaking of which, shapr, I noticed that Claus R. said that no one has voulentered to take care of HC&A
07:29:11 * SyntaxPolice guilts shapr
07:29:28 <isomer> why not just "voluntold" him? 
07:29:59 <isomer> that's what my did used to do to me and my brother: "i need two volunteers.....you, and you. let's go"
07:30:58 * shapr is guilted
07:31:14 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: I promise that I will contact Claus as soon as I resume my regular ritalin prescription
07:32:03 <shapr> but until that point, I require all of my available focus to do my job and study swedish.
07:32:27 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: fair enough :)
07:33:20 * isomer hands shapr an e-ritalin
07:33:32 <isomer> :(
09:01:29 <shapr> oh yeah???
09:01:38 <shapr> Chimp: it's all your fault man!
09:03:00 <shapr> Chimp: hi, have any Haskell questions?
09:19:33 <shapr> hi harsha123 
09:19:47 <harsha123> hi shapr how are you?
09:20:14 <shapr> I'm awake!
09:20:23 <shapr> it's time for swedish homework....
09:20:29 <shapr> I'd rather play a game...
09:20:33 <harsha123> :) 
09:20:55 <harsha123> shapr i backed up my data and i am installing a new debian system
09:21:00 <shapr> yay debian!
09:21:08 <harsha123> hmm..unable to get my mouse working 
09:21:19 <shapr> what sort of mouse?
09:21:40 <harsha123> its a psaux mouse
09:21:50 <shapr> sounds standard enough
09:22:34 <SyntaxPolice> I was recently thinking that a good approach to configuring X would be to run knoppix, save the XF86Config file, and copy it to your debian system :)
09:22:53 <harsha123> hmmm... ok..
09:23:08 <SyntaxPolice> well, that's just an idea.
09:23:10 <SyntaxPolice> haven't tried it
09:23:31 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice i heard that knoppix has a good h/w detecting system
09:24:01 <harsha123> and guys, kde 3.1 gives me a lot of problems
09:24:31 <earthy> syntaxpolice: that works reasonably well, yea
09:24:41 <earthy> however, you're still screwed if you're using an nVidia. :)
09:25:09 <shapr> which sadly, has the best OpenGL performance in Linux
09:25:27 <harsha123> when i say apt-get install kde it says that i need kdemultimedia and its not gonna get installed.... when i say apt-get install kdemultimedia it give me hell a lot of dependencies
09:25:50 <harsha123> i use a SiS (built into my motherboard)
09:26:18 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: what version of debian are you running?
09:26:28 <harsha123> i use unstable
09:26:35 <SyntaxPolice> it should just install the dependencies. something must be broken
09:26:48 <SyntaxPolice> do you see what package is broken?
09:27:08 <shapr> are you using apt-get -uf install kde
09:27:09 <shapr> ?
09:27:24 <harsha123> shapr no i just say apt-get install kde
09:27:31 <shapr> well, close enough :-)
09:28:06 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice it just says "Sorry, broken packages" but does not mention which 
09:28:23 <shapr> try apt-get -f install
09:28:28 <harsha123> shapr ok
09:28:37 <shapr> or possibly dpkg --configure --pending
09:28:59 <harsha123> ok
09:29:34 <harsha123> shapr hmmm.. gets back to the prompt.. no error messges
09:30:12 <harsha123> shapr and apt-get -f install  says 0 packages upgraded,installed,removed .........
09:31:56 <shapr> hm
09:32:14 <shapr> harsha123: have you recently done apt-get update ?
09:32:26 <harsha123> shapr yes just a few minutes back
09:32:49 <shapr> oh, I have the b0rked packages thingy too
09:33:04 <Igloo> Does it really not mention any package names?
09:33:12 <shapr> it mentions packages to me
09:33:14 <shapr> kdemultimedia
09:33:20 <shapr> which seems to have its own problems
09:33:32 <Igloo> Ah, OK
09:33:38 <harsha123> shapr i have the same problem kdemultimedia
09:33:56 <harsha123> and my damn mouse doesn't move
09:34:15 <shapr> I think that's a different problem
09:34:54 <harsha123> Igloo and i got a dependency on a package that does not even exist ..:(
09:34:56 <shapr> harsha123: try installing kde-core
09:35:03 <shapr> that's a good start
09:35:04 <harsha123> libsensor-1debian1 :(
09:35:09 <harsha123> shapr ok
09:35:20 <shapr> are you using gpm?
09:35:28 <shapr> have you configured X at all?
09:35:48 <harsha123> shapr worked.. no problems.. it installed some stuff.. :)
09:36:01 <harsha123> shapr X is configured but mouse does not work
09:36:24 <shapr> hm
09:36:29 <harsha123> shapr yes, i use gpm
09:36:39 <shapr> does gpm work in console?
09:36:44 <Lunar^> harsha123: I think this will not be fixed for KDE 3.1
09:37:04 <harsha123> Lunar^ hmm.. what do you mean? 
09:37:24 <Lunar^> harsha123: KDE 3.2 will arrive soon
09:37:49 <harsha123> Lunar^ :) what should i do until then :)
09:38:17 <Lunar^> harsha123: Use konstruct to build kde 3.2 beta :)
09:38:55 <harsha123> Lunar^ hmm...can ya help me with that?
09:39:32 <shapr> oy, I need help with a HC&A haskell-libs summary, who's available to help me hack up something on the wiki?
09:39:36 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: are you busy?
09:45:08 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice do you use unstable?
09:55:22 <harsha123> shapr i have another question, if i run apt-get install <kernel-patch>, should i do anything after that?
09:55:27 <shapr> yes
09:55:32 <shapr> the patches only install the source for the patch
09:55:37 <shapr> you need to install the kernel source itself
09:55:41 <shapr> and kernel-package
09:55:43 <shapr> and then build the kernel
09:56:31 <harsha123> shapr ok
09:57:05 <harsha123> shapr  do you use gpm?
09:57:05 <shapr> nope
09:57:05 <shapr> it's caused me problems in the past
09:57:08 <harsha123> hmm.. Ok
09:58:16 <harsha123> any gpm user? my mouse pointer moves really fast,i mean its really "responsive" any plz where i can set that alright?
09:58:34 <shapr> have you tried removing gpm? or do you need it?
09:58:52 <harsha123> shapr hmm.. anything better than gpm?
09:59:23 <shapr> I don't know, I don't use my mouse in console
09:59:57 <harsha123> hmm..ok..
10:00:17 <keverets> harsha123: man gpm
10:00:46 <keverets> you probably want to change the acceleration.
10:01:01 <harsha123> keverets hmm.. lemme try
10:01:12 <keverets> or responsiveness.
10:17:28 <shapr> hi maihem 
10:17:40 <shapr> looking for Haskell info?
10:22:01 <maihem> Hi shapr, yeah, currently trying to define an instance of IArray, but I can't figure out how to get the index type
10:23:46 <shapr> can you define boring arrays already?
10:24:59 <maihem> array (ix_min,ix_max) [(i1,v1),(i2,v2),...etc...]
10:26:06 <maihem> I've written this, but it's clearly not right:
10:26:14 <maihem> data (HasBounds a) => MArray a e =
10:26:20 <maihem>   MArray (i,i2) { mapping :: ix -> ix, store :: IArray a e }
10:26:22 <shapr> myarray = array (0,5) [((index),index) | index <- [0..5]]
10:26:22 <shapr> myarray2 = array ((0,0),(3,3)) [((x,y),x-y) | x <- [0..3], y <- [0..3]]
10:26:33 <shapr> does that help any?
10:27:01 <maihem> I mean I want to make a data definition and define it to be an instance of the IArray class
10:27:10 <shapr> oh
10:27:29 <maihem> but as you see from the data, I need to find the type of the index of the array that I'm constructing it from
10:28:17 <maihem> I think "a" above is the "array" in "array (ixmin,ixmax) [associations]"
10:28:19 <shapr> isn't it just any instance of Ix ?
10:28:32 <shapr> are you familiar with typeclasses?
10:28:41 <maihem> a bit
10:29:05 <shapr> do you know Java interfaces?
10:29:21 <maihem> Oh, yes
10:29:30 <shapr> ok, a Haskell typeclass is a lot like a Java interface
10:29:40 <shapr> except that you can easily define them after the fact
10:29:57 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/src/haskell/Demo.hs
10:30:01 <maihem> so you define the data, then say it is an instance of an existing class
10:30:26 <Tomasso> ERROR "C:\trabajo\TeamB.hs":132 - Syntax error in expression (unexpected `=') 
10:30:37 <Tomasso> grgr what should i do...?
10:30:39 <shapr> Tomasso: you have offended the compiler. YOU MUST DIE.
10:30:47 <shapr> okay, maybe not :-)
10:30:50 <Tomasso> i cant figure out why is it happening..
10:30:55 <Tomasso> hahhaha
10:31:01 <shapr> I think there's an equals sign that it's not expecting.
10:31:09 <Tomasso> the compiler is an ofense! :D HAHAHHAA

10:33:01 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: I've hacked up a few lines of summary, could you look at it and make suggestions or comments?
10:33:26 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: sure. though I haven't followed haskell-libs really closely lately :)
10:33:51 <shapr> well, nothing has happened anyway...
10:34:24 <shapr> it's at the bottom of this page: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ShaeErisson
10:35:06 <shapr> oh, an url would be useful
10:36:03 <Tomasso> a better html version 
10:36:09 <Tomasso> http://168.226.148.78/trabajo/doc/TeamB-0.2.html
10:37:41 <dark> Tomasso: I think your problem is uneven indentation.
10:38:10 <dark> Tomasso: Line 132 is indented one space more than the line before it, so it's considered part of the previous expression.
10:38:15 <dark> Tomasso: Try not using tabs :)
10:38:18 <Tomasso> hmm dark where
10:38:53 <dark> Tomasso: I'm looking at http://168.226.148.78/trabajo/TeamB.hs
10:39:00 <Tomasso> in my editor is ok, i dunno why the browser shows those lines with one more space..
10:39:05 <Tomasso> dark: yes..
10:39:18 <Tomasso> click on update
10:39:21 <dark> Tomasso: It's not a browser thing, I saved it locally and I'm looking with vi.
10:39:49 <dark> Tomasso: You probably have your editor set to a heretical false tab size.
10:40:14 <Tomasso> hmmh i think youŕe right
10:40:34 <Tomasso> click update
10:40:53 <dark> Tomasso: do you still get that error message?
10:41:21 <Tomasso> dark: yes
10:41:33 <Tomasso> same error..
10:49:11 <dark> Tomasso: Well, then I don't know.
10:50:40 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: do you want me to make my suggestions as changes directly to the wiki?
10:51:29 <shapr> e) all of the above
10:52:19 <SyntaxPolice> what's the link?
10:52:41 <shapr> it's at the bottom of this page: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ShaeErisson
10:52:50 <shapr> oh, to the project?
10:52:59 <shapr> http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/ so far
10:53:08 <shapr> what do you suggest?
10:53:15 <shapr> I guess I'd like to mention the darcs repo
10:53:25 <shapr> gee I dunno
10:53:34 <shapr> what would you expect to see on this sort of summary?
10:54:20 <jasonw> Who hosts www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hlibs?
10:54:33 <shapr> me me!
10:54:55 <shapr> I did it!
10:55:11 <shapr> jasonw: questions? comments? problems?
10:55:16 <jasonw> Cool. Did you know that the folder links from there (say to lambdabot) seem to be broken? They point to repos/lambdabot rather than repos/hlibs/lambdabot.
10:55:28 <shapr> yes, that's because it's a darcs repository
10:55:39 <jasonw> Ahh.
10:55:47 <shapr> if you use darcs to fetch it, you get the whole thing
10:56:38 <jasonw> Alright. I just thought I'd point it out in case you weren't aware. Thanks.
10:56:52 <shapr> sure
10:57:20 <shapr> if you want to put some of your Haskell sources there on ScannedInAvian.org, I'd be happy to give you write privs
10:57:30 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: OK check out my changes
10:57:48 <shapr> sounds good
10:58:48 <shapr> ok, I'll ship it out.
10:59:05 <SyntaxPolice> oh
10:59:06 <SyntaxPolice> wait
10:59:12 <SyntaxPolice> you might want to say a little more about each project
10:59:18 <SyntaxPolice> like what is brainfuck :)
10:59:29 <shapr> well, Claus said if I send it *now*
10:59:33 <shapr> it might get into this edition
10:59:35 <SyntaxPolice> OK
10:59:38 <shapr> but otherwise I've missed it.
10:59:56 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: oh, and I'd like to request an unwritten tutorial, please.
11:00:02 <shapr> sure, what is it?
11:00:03 <SyntaxPolice> One Unwritten Tutorial. Rare.
11:00:07 <dark> I think brainfuck might be a bad example of something needing documentation :)
11:00:28 <SyntaxPolice> I don't know. I just think the topic is funny.
11:00:32 * shapr snickers
11:01:39 <shapr> bah, I'll stick in a line about the darcs repo
11:02:00 <SyntaxPolice> hurry, Claus is coming!
11:02:10 * SyntaxPolice hears his footsteps
11:02:21 <shapr> aiee!
11:02:37 <shapr> happily Claus is a bit smaller than I am, I can probably run faster than him.
11:02:49 <shapr> Claus does dress much more nicely than I do though.
11:06:04 <shapr> Lunar^: you want me to mention PDFlib?
11:07:20 <SyntaxPolice> btw, speaking of darcs, I've been using arch happily for a few weeks now
11:07:38 <shapr> I'll probably get around to trying it myself, but I like darcs so far.
11:07:45 <SyntaxPolice> I think that libraryInfrastructure will be delivered under arch, so you can play with it :)
11:08:45 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: can I give you creds for writing part of the summary?
11:09:22 <SyntaxPolice> sure
11:09:24 <shapr> ok
11:09:29 <SyntaxPolice> not necessary, though :)
11:24:15 <shapr> andersca_: new hostname?
11:24:37 <andersca_> shapr: no, this is my lapto
11:24:42 <andersca_> p
11:25:13 <shapr> oh, neat
11:27:23 <dark> Evidently the lapto has a less wide screen.
11:27:47 * shapr grins
11:37:12 <Tomasso> the higher order function filter gets a function of type (a -> Bool)
11:37:26 <Tomasso> when i say for example:
11:37:57 <Tomasso> test e j = filter function,,,
11:38:35 <Tomasso> i need function to get 3 parameters, but filter is going to apply only one
11:38:52 <shapr> use partial application
11:39:05 <Tomasso> shapr: how do i do that?
11:39:14 <Tomasso> let me see on the web
11:39:19 <shapr> make a function of type (b -> a -> Bool), then pass it the b before you pass it into the filter
11:40:32 <Tomasso> and filter will add the missing parameter?
11:46:40 <shapr> Tomasso: have you done something like map (+ 1) [1,2,3] ?
11:46:48 <shapr> the + is just a function
11:47:00 <shapr> when you give it one argument, you get back a new function that has that argument filled in
11:47:10 <shapr> so you can do something like addOne = (+ 1)
11:47:25 <Tomasso> shapr: i see
11:47:47 <Tomasso> shapr: yes i have, but still not so good at this
11:47:47 <shapr> so if you pass in the first argument, you can get back a new function that is a -> Bool
11:48:06 <Tomasso> shapr: and if i pass the second??
11:48:22 <Tomasso> can i?
11:48:34 <shapr> how can you do that?
11:48:52 <dark> If you start with a function c -> b -> a -> Bool
11:49:53 <Tomasso> blah x = filter (function c a) x
11:50:28 <Tomasso> if x is of type [b], will the function's type be korrect?
11:51:58 <ibid> no
11:52:21 <ibid> b needs to be the last argument of function
12:04:55 <harsha123> omg, finally got X working :)
12:05:11 <shapr> yay
12:05:15 <dark> The next step: Y!
12:05:18 <harsha123> shapr  :)
12:05:19 <SyntaxPolice> yay harsha123
12:05:35 <SyntaxPolice> did you manage to install kde?
12:05:41 <harsha123> i just ran this tool call xf86cfg
12:06:12 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice hmm.. it was kinda running but it had dependencies, actually it still has
12:06:22 <harsha123> now the mouse works fine..
12:07:40 <harsha123> buti gotta do a modprobe rt8139oo everytime.. does that mean the ethernet card driver is a module that is not installed while the kernel boots ?
12:08:25 <harsha123> i use a realtek ethernetcard
12:08:59 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: take a look at /etc/modules
12:09:07 <harsha123> ok
12:10:21 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice hmm.. not there.. i guess i gotta make an entry into that file
12:11:05 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice do you know how to get small fonts in console?
12:11:16 <harsha123> extended font size.
12:11:21 <harsha123> i use grub
12:12:57 <SyntaxPolice> no, don' tknow anything about fonts :)
12:13:13 <harsha123> :) nevermind, thanx for the help 
12:13:18 <harsha123> thanks shapr :)
12:13:31 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: btw, have you upgraded? Did you install from a CD?
12:14:12 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice i had a woody CD with me, i just installed the base system and the upgraded to unstable using apt-get
12:14:31 <SyntaxPolice> ok. that's good. just wanted to make sure you had up-to-date packages
12:15:04 <harsha123> i guess i am, but am having this problem with kdemultimedia broken package
12:15:29 <harsha123> someone at #debian was telling me its bug :(
12:15:51 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice do you run unstable too?
12:15:55 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: yeah
12:16:15 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: did you check to see if there are any bugs open on kdemultimedia that might cause this problem?
12:16:20 <SyntaxPolice> (I don't use kde)
12:16:30 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice what do you use?
12:16:42 <harsha123> Gnome?
12:17:02 <SyntaxPolice> yeah
12:17:07 <harsha123> okay!
12:17:39 <SyntaxPolice> to check bug reports, go here and type the package name: http://www.debian.org/Bugs/
12:17:55 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice ok, i'll do that !
12:18:04 <SyntaxPolice> and as we see here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=208832
12:18:07 <SyntaxPolice> it's broken right now.
12:18:11 <SyntaxPolice> that's what running unstable is like.
12:18:23 <SyntaxPolice> does that look like the error you're getting?
12:18:33 <harsha123> lemme see
12:20:24 <harsha123> perfect! same bug..
12:20:37 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice can i find a solution to it?
12:21:29 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: the bug is open right now, which implies that there is no solution. once it's closed, that means it's fixed.
12:22:00 <harsha123> okay, got ya
12:23:09 <SyntaxPolice> you should read the commends for workarounds, but it doesn't look like there are any.
12:23:30 <harsha123> ok
12:26:07 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice: my connections to the internet go through a proxy server... i want to know if apt-get does any kind of caching either in my system or in the proxy server
12:27:51 <SyntaxPolice> it caches packages on your system, yes. it also keeps a list of packages it knows about (updated when you run apt-get update)
12:28:13 <SyntaxPolice> the packages are in /var/cache/apt/archives
12:28:28 <harsha123> ok
12:28:32 <SyntaxPolice> but I'm not sure if that's what you mean :)
12:31:09 <harsha123> :) i asked you that because i am trying to install ghc6 and i get errors like "Failed to fetch <package-name> could not connect 192.168.1.5 (my proxy server)
12:32:13 <SyntaxPolice> btw, have you seen DebianUsers on the haskell wiki?
12:33:08 <harsha123> hmmm.. no.. anything special ? :)
12:33:36 <SyntaxPolice> the haskell experimental debian repository is mentioned there
12:33:57 <SyntaxPolice> but you don't need to use that to get most packages
12:34:03 <harsha123> okay.... 
12:34:26 <harsha123> god, i need some sleep :)
12:34:38 <harsha123> catch ya guys tomorrow..:) 
12:34:47 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice :) thanx a many
12:34:54 <harsha123> shapr you too
12:34:57 <SyntaxPolice> peace
12:35:02 <harsha123> :)
12:38:38 <maihem> from http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/fpu/ghc-guides/set/sec-iarray.html, it seems that in order to define an instance of IArray, I must define a function "array (ix,ix) [(ix,e)]", however I would like to define something more like "myarray (ix,ix) srcarray idxmappingfn" and not have the normal array function
12:38:42 <maihem> is this possible?
13:42:20 <rubix> what's the first argument to showsPrec for ?
13:42:26 <rubix> showsPrec :: Int -> a -> ShowS
13:43:50 <Darius> for what the Prec stands for
13:44:10 <rubix> so what do that "Prec" means ?
13:45:01 <Riastradh> Precedence, maybe?
13:46:08 * rubix does not understand
13:47:50 <norpan> you can use it for whatever you like
13:47:57 <rubix> I mean, the Int is ignored, so showsPrec _ = shows, then why have a showsPrec function ?
13:47:57 <norpan> i use it for indentation and precedence
13:48:45 <norpan> you can use it for your own data types
13:48:59 <rubix> ok, I understand now
13:49:34 <Igloo> The standard instances will use it for putting parens in only when necessary
13:50:27 <rubix> but when you define only show, the Int is ignored
13:51:48 <rubix> I should have searched deeper in the libraries, there are examples where it is used
13:52:49 <rubix> btw, sorry, I'm not sure my english is correct
14:03:34 <Igloo> It'll also be used by "deriving Show"
15:03:57 <SyntaxPolice> does anyone want to talk about the type sig for reactimate in frp? :)
15:04:24 <SyntaxPolice> in particular, I'm trying to figure out why "sense" is responsible for keeping track of delta-time
17:05:44 <shapr> @yow
17:05:45 <lambdabot> Loni Anderson's hair should be LEGALIZED!!
17:06:37 <SyntaxLaptop> hey shapr
17:07:05 <Pseudonym> @arr
17:07:05 <lambdabot> Get out of me way, yeh landlubber
17:08:57 <shapr> hi SyntaxPolice
17:16:38 <blackdog> @arr
17:16:38 <lambdabot> Ahoy mateys
17:16:54 <SyntaxLaptop> hey blackdog, what's up?
17:17:06 <blackdog> my temperature.
17:17:14 <SyntaxLaptop> oh yeah? not feelin' well?
17:17:25 <blackdog> nope. enforced idleness sucks
17:17:40 <blackdog> i like the other kind.
17:17:50 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah, I know what you mean.
20:21:15 <ozone> re
