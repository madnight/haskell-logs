04:41:43 <shapr> @yow
04:41:43 <lambdabot> LBJ, LBJ, how many JOKES did you tell today??!
04:41:56 <shapr> I like IKE!
04:42:20 <shapr> my uncle has a real "I like IKE" button from his father
07:05:26 <shapr> yeehaa
07:15:20 <isomer> hi shapr
07:16:36 <shapr> hi anth, wassup?
07:17:04 <isomer> not much -- been doing lots of reading on building compilers
07:17:22 <isomer> you know, you functional guys have this stuff in the bag - the rest of us are back in the dark ages
07:17:29 <shapr> yup :-)
07:17:41 <isomer> i'm learning a *lot*
07:17:54 <shapr> on the other hand, heavy duty side-effect stuff like GUIs are much easier with imperative programming.
07:18:06 <isomer> so instead of learning haskell, i'm learning how to implement haskell. i'm so weird...
07:18:08 <shapr> have you gotten into monadic parsers? they're quite spiffy.
07:18:28 <isomer> not yet
07:18:49 <isomer> i'm trying to figure out whether or not i can do functional transformations on a non-functional language
07:19:44 <isomer> any opinions?
07:20:36 <shapr> This is not the language you're looking for. 
07:20:40 * shapr tries Jedi mind tricks on isomer 
07:20:56 <isomer> this is not the language i'm looking for
07:21:25 <shapr> isomer: you *can* do functional stuff with Python, for example. But I don't know what sort of functional transformations you mean.
07:21:41 <shapr> xoltar.org has a toolkit that lets you do currying, partial application, etc with Python.
07:22:30 <isomer> well, i'd like to build a stackless interpreter for an oo language, and i'm wondering if that's possible 
07:23:03 <isomer> more precisely, i'm wondering if functional is a superset of procedural
07:23:16 * isomer looks at shapr's link
07:23:21 <shapr> my link?
07:23:34 <shapr> oh, xoltar.org
07:23:43 <shapr> I do think that functional is a superset.
07:24:04 <shapr> but I also think most programmers aren't ready for it. They've grown up learning imperative stuff, and it's forever drilled into their understanding.
07:24:11 <isomer> i agree
07:24:39 <isomer> but i'm building a little compiler and vm for my own amusement, so.... the lemmings don't matter to me :)
07:25:01 <shapr> in that case, you may find it a lot easier to build your compiler and interpreter in Haskell.
07:25:17 <shapr> I've heard it's even easier to build stuff in OCaml, but you lose some of the guarantees that functional purity gives you.
07:25:45 <shapr> parsers are way easy to write in Haskell.
07:26:01 <isomer> i got that impression, yes
07:26:19 <isomer> although i have a working parser already, so i'm most likely going to bootstrap off it
07:26:25 <phubuh> If by "functional", you mean "referentially transparent", and by procedural you mean the opposite, procedural is the superset.
07:27:03 <isomer> phubuh: don't follow :( -- i clearly have lots more reading to do. can you explain a bit?
07:27:31 <shapr> yes, tell us more!
07:27:35 <phubuh> Basically, there are imperative programs that can't be written purely functionally.
07:27:41 <shapr> like what?
07:28:04 <phubuh> Consider these three functions:
07:28:12 <phubuh> top x = ()
07:28:16 <phubuh> mid x = x ()
07:28:18 <phubuh> bot x = bot x
07:28:38 * Smerdyakov waits for the punchline.
07:28:54 <shapr> Smerdyakov: but what does he want a bricklayer for?
07:29:10 <phubuh> Now, consider this function:
07:29:12 <phubuh> f top = false
07:29:14 <phubuh> f mid = true
07:29:17 <phubuh> f bot = f bot
07:29:49 <Smerdyakov> phubuh, that's the constantly-false function in Haskell.
07:29:59 <Smerdyakov> Or probably a compile error
07:30:14 <Smerdyakov> Lowercases names in function definitions are variables.
07:30:15 <phubuh> Yeah, this isn't Haskell
07:30:48 <Smerdyakov> The function f you are describing isn't computable, though.
07:31:02 <phubuh> It is with mutable state
07:31:19 <Smerdyakov> OK. How?
07:32:11 <phubuh> let f g = let b = ref false in (g (fun () -> b := true)); !b
07:32:57 <Smerdyakov> You can do the same thing with the IO monad in Haskell.
07:34:39 <Smerdyakov> Not to mention that your informal definition of f did not denote a function.
07:34:44 <Smerdyakov> You only gave its behavior for three inputs.
07:35:11 <shapr> well, I dunno about supersets, but I do think Haskell is powerful and useful.
07:35:53 <isomer> so in the end, do you beleive that there is something i can express in (say) smalltalk that i could not transform functionally?
07:36:12 * isomer is having trouble thinking about this from the functional side, still
07:36:36 <phubuh> Smerdyakov, well, yes. You could also do it by implementing an OCaml interpreter in Haskell.
07:36:45 <Smerdyakov> No one believes that. phubuh's example is easy to transform to make top, mid, and bot return the changed cell values, for instance.
07:37:31 <Smerdyakov> phubuh, that's correct. So you seem to disagree now with your earlier statement.
07:37:39 <shapr> but, if you can implement an OCaml interpreter in Haskell, and Haskell is purely functional, doesn't that mean it can be done?
07:38:43 <shapr> isomer: anyways, I think Haskell is worth trying, especially if you're writing a compiler or interpreter.
07:38:54 <shapr> plus then I can rope you into writing a lambdabot plugin ;-)
07:39:10 <isomer> shapr: i'm slowly getting sucked in -- not to worry
07:39:13 <shapr> yay!
07:40:04 <isomer> shapr: the first thing i'm building is a little vm that very tightly integrates smalltalk and C (ie for building games)
07:40:12 <Smerdyakov> Cool. My updated xchat client has a new icon. :D
07:40:15 <Smerdyakov> isomer, lame.
07:40:23 <Smerdyakov> isomer, use ML instead of C!
07:40:38 <isomer> can't -- opengl etc are all c libraries
07:40:50 <phubuh> What I meant to say was that you can't write that function and have it be of the type ((unit -> unit) -> unit) -> bool :-)
07:40:52 <Smerdyakov> No problem.
07:40:59 <Smerdyakov> ML compilers tend to support C interaction.
07:41:13 <isomer> the type of mix i want is much tighter than that
07:41:27 <isomer> eg - instances can have instance variables that are C structs, or even C pointers
07:41:29 <Smerdyakov> phubuh, and you can't write it in OCaml and have it match the prototype int f(int, char);
07:41:47 <Smerdyakov> isomer, why?
07:41:50 <isomer> and instances can have methods or C functions defined on them, etc etc... no translating and transforming between c and smalltalk
07:42:09 <Smerdyakov> isomer, (and the SML/NJ FFI allows such things within ML)
07:42:22 <Smerdyakov> isomer, why?
07:42:25 <phubuh> Hm. I might have implemented it naively, but I wrote a simple particle system in OCaml, and I had to poke the garbage collector a lot to make it appear smoothly...
07:42:43 <isomer> Smerdyakov: because i (well a group of us) believe that there is no reason to write a 3D engine in C, when 90% of the time is spend in the drawing code in opengl and only 10% of the time is spent in the engine
07:42:58 <Smerdyakov> isomer, right. You should write it in ML.
07:43:13 <isomer> why?
07:43:18 <shapr> no, Haskell!
07:43:39 <shapr> actually, I'd like to profile the HOpenGL stuff...
07:43:42 <Smerdyakov> Because you get practically all the speed with an orders of magnitude better language, from a software engineering perspective.
07:44:06 <isomer> how much is practically?
07:44:40 <Smerdyakov> http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/craps.shtml
07:44:43 <shapr> notice that Smerdyakov is the founder of the #sml channel, and I'm the founder of the #haskell channel...
07:44:47 <shapr> see where our loyalties lie.
07:44:52 <shapr> Smerdyakov: that's a pretty old study
07:45:03 <shapr> I think it used GHC5.0 for example
07:45:07 <isomer> ah -- you are all just pushing your biases on me! :)
07:45:10 <Smerdyakov> Notice that shapr is clearly American, because he conceives of everything in a naive competitive way.
07:45:15 <shapr> Smerdyakov: hehe
07:45:20 <Smerdyakov> Not a joke.
07:45:31 <shapr> Smerdyakov: ah, then you have misperceived me.
07:45:52 * isomer offers to race shapr
07:45:59 <isomer> that way we can compete
07:46:03 <isomer> won't it be fun?
07:46:09 <shapr> but everything is a competition already ;-)
07:46:12 * shapr grins
07:46:16 <Smerdyakov> isomer, you're free to write your own benchmarks for what interests you. I think you'll find no runtime performance reason to favor gcc over MLton or OCaml.
07:47:14 <phubuh> I would love to see some 3D graphics benchmarks.
07:47:24 <shapr> Smerdyakov: if life really is a competition, then I've already won and I don't need to compete anymore.
07:47:26 <Smerdyakov> phubuh, then write 'em. :)
07:47:29 <isomer> Smerdyakov: can i reflect C structs, C pointers, and C numbers (eg floats, doubles, long ints), and C strings directly into ML or OCaml and manipulate them as if they were native? or do i have to conver them?
07:47:46 <shapr> you can do that in Haskell with the FFI
07:47:53 <phubuh> By the way, http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/longley99when.html
07:47:57 <Smerdyakov> isomer, I'm not entirely sure. But why does it matter?
07:48:24 <isomer> Smerdyakov: that is pretty much the central issue i am addressing. we need to mix C code with high level code, and don't want to have a barrier between them
07:48:38 <Smerdyakov> isomer, why do you need that?
07:48:53 <isomer> because we are writing game code
07:48:59 <Smerdyakov> And..?
07:49:30 <shapr> Smerdyakov: I think you should backup your comments with code if you want me to believe them.
07:49:32 <shapr> show me
07:49:34 <isomer> and we need to write some of it in C and some of it in a higher level language, and we don't want to have translate structures back and forth
07:50:12 <isomer> i would like, for example, to have a high level structure (eg an object) with an instance variable that is an OpenGL buffer
07:50:27 <isomer> ...and be able to talk to the buffer in exactly the same way i would talk to an object
07:50:31 <Smerdyakov> isomer, you'd like that, but you have no reason why you can show that that's "the best" way to do it.
07:50:39 <shapr> Smerdyakov: be nice
07:51:05 <Smerdyakov> isomer, I think the Right Way involves creating an OpenGL library for your language of choice. It's likely one already exists.
07:51:10 <Smerdyakov> isomer, if not, you spend the one-time effort to create it.
07:51:43 <isomer> Smerdyakov: because after 3 years of building game engines (professionally, not as a hobby), my experience tells me that it is the best way to proceed
07:53:06 <Smerdyakov> isomer, how much experience do you have with ML?
07:53:30 <isomer> none at all. and i should point out that i'm hanging out here because i want to learn
07:54:17 <Smerdyakov> isomer, so how is your experience relevant to evaluating a solution that uses ML?
07:55:01 <isomer> well, can i do the things i want in ML? ie directly integrate structures the way I described (that is very different than having an openGL library)?
07:55:26 <Smerdyakov> isomer, you probably can't, but you have not defended the assertion that you need that capability.
07:56:03 <shapr> oh come on, you can preach about Haskell here on #haskell, but if you want to preach about SML, take it to #sml
07:56:07 <shapr> :-P
07:56:34 <Smerdyakov> There's no other conversation.
07:57:03 <Smerdyakov> And I think this is a general argument related to realizing that language technologies evolve over time. ;)
07:57:12 <isomer> Smerdyakov: after 3 years of building game engines with libraries AND building them directly in C++, i have concluded, from my experience, that the best way to build a game engine is in a high level language with direct access to C structures. that's the end of the justification. you can take it or leave it.
07:57:41 <Smerdyakov> isomer, C++ is a beast. ML is simple.
07:58:10 <isomer> smalltalk is simple too, and i have 10 years of experience with it. but no direct C integration makes it worlds more complicated
07:58:19 <Smerdyakov> Not to mention that 3 years is a long time. Hardware capabilities may have increased enough to invalidate all your old conclusiosn.
07:58:42 <shapr> Smerdyakov: I think he said he has been building game engines for the last three years
07:58:47 <shapr> so I think that means his experience is current.
07:59:01 <isomer> yes
07:59:14 <Smerdyakov> Right, and it's far too easy to stick to doing things the same way without honestly reevaluating them fully every time you use them.
07:59:41 <isomer> i *AM* reevaluating them! that's the point! that's why i'm building a vm that tightly integrates smalltalk and C structures
07:59:47 <shapr> Smerdyakov: so show us a demo and demo code of C and SML integration
08:00:07 <shapr> I haven't used the Haskell FFI before, but it would be a cool thing to learn.
08:00:51 <Smerdyakov> shapr, read some manuals and you'll see it spelled out.
08:01:02 <shapr> Smerdyakov: no, you're the proponent, you show us ;-)
08:01:05 <shapr> I'll show Haskell code...
08:01:41 <shapr> isomer: what sort of integration are you interested in?
08:02:46 <shapr> can you give one or two examples that we could implement?
08:02:46 <Smerdyakov> I'm not interesting in showing you, because a good engineer should be willing to do his own research, and I don't need to explain things to bad engineers. :P
08:02:50 <isomer> a smalltalk object that has instance variables that are a mix of C pointers, C structs, and C base types, and also (obviously) pointers to other smalltalk objects. Also, smalltalk objects that can call C functions directly
08:02:53 <shapr> Smerdyakov: ah, of course..
08:04:51 * shapr shrugs
08:07:18 * shapr tries to think of a helpful demonstration using the Haskell FFI
08:08:01 <shapr> so, you want direct access to C pointer, C struct, C base types, and C functions
08:09:04 <isomer> yes - so i can write, for example, part of an algorithm in smalltalk, and part in C, without having to do all kinds of conversions. in fact, ideally, i'd like to be able to put the C code inline right with the smalltalk code
08:09:14 <isomer> (i say smalltalk -- could be any high level language)
08:09:25 <Smerdyakov> This is soooo clearly an example of unnecessary optimization.
08:09:30 <Smerdyakov> At the cost of clean software models.
08:09:46 <shapr> but isomer already said that's what he wants to do...
08:10:04 <Smerdyakov> I don't mind telling people that they want to do the wrong things.
08:10:12 <isomer> Smerdyakov: have you ever built a game engine?
08:10:15 <shapr> question is, can you help them do what they want to do?
08:11:07 <Smerdyakov> isomer, no.
08:11:28 <Smerdyakov> isomer, have you ever written an ML program that interacts with C libraries? ;)
08:12:12 <phubuh> I've done both :-)
08:12:15 <isomer> no, but i have written many programs that interact with C libraries, and that is the problem i am trying to address. how is it different in ML than in say python or smalltalk?
08:12:42 <phubuh> Well, not really. I've written a trivial particle system in OCaml using its OpenGL bindings.
08:13:31 <Smerdyakov> isomer, ML compilers produce code with no significant differences from C compilers in terms of runtime efficiency.
08:13:55 <isomer> i'm not worried about the runtime. i'm worried about how the 2 layers interact
08:14:06 <Smerdyakov> Ah, but your layers are ONLY PRESENT as an OPTIMIZATION.
08:14:12 <shapr> Smerdyakov: let it go man
08:14:18 <shapr> or take it to #sml
08:15:53 <shapr> hi opet 
08:16:29 <opet> hello
08:16:35 <shapr> how's code?
08:16:56 <opet> slow
08:16:57 <opet> you?
08:17:00 <isomer> Smerdyakov: look -- i *am* integrating C and a high level language. you're trying to convince me that i should do it with ML. that's fine. please either tell me why I should, or drop it. please stop telling me that it's not the right thing to do.
08:17:07 <shapr> hacking on some Python for a Zope site
08:18:11 <shapr> opet: hacked on anything interesting lately?
08:18:29 <Smerdyakov> isomer, I'm trying to convince you that conversion across language boundaries is fine. You don't need the sort of "embedding" that you're describing to achieve your goal.
08:18:54 <opet> not really :(
08:19:14 <opet> spent my time butchering vnc for remote tech support at work
08:19:22 <opet> no time for haskell
08:19:24 <shapr> aww
08:20:18 <Smerdyakov> isomer, what you describe is, as I understand it, an optimization of converting <high level language> parameters to C parameter formats and calling OpenGL functions. I'm saying that the cost of such an operation is already acceptable.
08:21:24 <shapr> asmodai: still alive?
08:22:00 <shapr> Smerdyakov: so write it both ways in ML, and profile it. show me :-)
08:22:11 <isomer> it's not an optimization. we're not concerned at all about the speed. the issue is the programmer pain of having to deal with code in both. there is *no choice* but to write code in both -- or well, there is a choice, and the choice is to manipulate C structs and pointers in the high level language, and it sucks balls to do that.
08:23:35 <Smerdyakov> isomer, or you can write appropriate wrapper code in C, and call _that_ from the HLL.
08:24:02 <isomer> Smerdyakov: right. that's *precisely* what i'm trying to avoid. that's what we're doing now.
08:24:16 <Smerdyakov> Why are you trying to avoid it
08:25:22 <isomer> because it causes us a lot of programmer pain to have to write and debug code at two levels. we want to do it all at the same level. so the choice is do it all in C++, or drag C++ kicking and screaming upward into a sensible language
08:26:42 <Smerdyakov> But this involves one small amount of straightforward hacking per library you want to interface with a HLL.
08:26:52 <Smerdyakov> Someone probably already did it.
08:27:21 <Smerdyakov> Quick Google search gives http://www.exept.de/sites/exept/onlineDoc/english/programming/opengl.html
08:27:23 <isomer> no, we have to manipulate C structures in our code. it's not just a matter of calling library functions
08:28:11 <Smerdyakov> Untrue. Library interfaces are allowed to completely change the interface they export, such that you can use native HLL conventions.
08:28:35 <isomer> huh?
08:29:03 <Smerdyakov> Perhaps better would be to ask: Why do you need to manipulate C structures to create OpenGL graphics from Smalltalk programs?
08:29:32 <Smerdyakov> If someone has already written the code to mess with C and given you a pure Smalltalk interface to it, why go backwards and even do anything to acknowledge that C is involved?
08:30:26 <isomer> we need to, for example, construct and alter vertex arrays, we need to bit-shift colour components around, we need to write shader code, etc, etc, etc.... and we either have to wrap all the C code that does that (which splits our algorithms across two layers) or we have to push the whole algorithm downward, or we can pull it entirely upward. we want to pull it upward
08:31:01 <Smerdyakov> You forgot an option.
08:31:08 <isomer> what's that?
08:31:13 <Smerdyakov> You can have _someone_else_ write all the Smalltalk code that wraps it.
08:31:18 <Smerdyakov> And, indeed, this has already been done multiple times.
08:34:07 <isomer> Smerdyakov: we are trying to innovate new ideas, so we are not overly interested in other people's libraries... we are, after all, a research company
08:34:32 <Smerdyakov> OK. I mistakenly thought that your goal was to produce high quality games quickly.
08:34:51 <isomer> not really - i guess i didn't make that clear. sorry
08:36:34 <Smerdyakov> What company is this?
08:37:41 <isomer> learning dimensions
08:39:13 <shapr> hoi blitznl 
08:39:24 <shapr> how's your new imperative lifestyle treating you?
08:39:52 * isomer attempts to curri himself
08:40:15 <Smerdyakov> isomer, it's a company that only does research?
08:41:31 <isomer> so far, yes. though products are definitely in the future plans. most likely a toolkit for building games, and a game or two also. though i suspect the games will be mostly a way to show off the toolkit in the end
08:42:04 <Smerdyakov> isomer, how are you surviving re: funding now?
08:42:20 <isomer> Smerdyakov: we have virtually infinite funding - that's not an issue
08:43:13 <Smerdyakov> isomer, what I mean is, where do you get it?
08:43:30 <isomer> privately funded
08:44:00 <Smerdyakov> By the employees?
08:44:26 <isomer> by the owner
08:45:00 <blitznl> hoi shapr
08:45:10 <Smerdyakov> Is this someone who got rich before the dot-com bubble burst? :)
08:45:33 <isomer> yup
08:46:32 <blitznl> shapr: well that dynamic updating has some problems, but it should be a challange right ;)
08:46:36 <Smerdyakov> Nice. I'm asking these questions because I'm interested in exploring non-traditional environments for research some day. The academic scene with dependence on government funding doesn't suit me much, and depending on greedy corporations isn't much better.
08:46:48 <isomer> *nod*
08:47:22 <shapr> blitznl: yes, it's a challenge
08:47:29 <isomer> although this is a double edged sword... we can go on forever, so there is comparatively less motivation to produce results
08:47:38 <shapr> isomer: XP!
08:48:15 <isomer> it's a motivate-the-boss-to-show-the-world-what-we've-got issue, not a developer issue :(
08:48:15 <Smerdyakov> I think a worldwide association of people producing open research results for the public good, while also doing consulting and education to stay afloat, could work.
08:48:46 <shapr> that sounds like global socialism or something.
08:48:57 * shapr throws gasoline
08:49:08 * isomer throws a match
08:49:39 <shapr> Smerdyakov: capitalism seems to produce more results.
08:49:42 * Smerdyakov is thinking about funding because the National Science Foundation fellowship deadline is this week. :)
08:50:10 <isomer> filling out applications is one of my favourite activities!!!
08:50:14 <shapr> wow!!
08:50:17 <shapr> hej tic 
08:50:36 <Smerdyakov> I think my research proposal is less imaginary this year, and hopefully more practical sounding. :)
08:50:38 <tic> tjena shapr! jag har flyttat och fått BBB!
08:50:44 <Smerdyakov> (I applied last year and didn't get it.)
08:50:48 <phubuh> yay!
08:50:56 <shapr> you've moved?
08:51:09 <tic> shapr, yeah, to the city.
08:51:14 <Smerdyakov> Writing a PhD research proposal as an undergraduate is a rare and effective form of torture.
08:51:28 <tic> shapr, just yesterday. 13 min to Chalmers UoT compared to 1h =)
08:52:07 <shapr> oh, nice
08:52:16 <tic> yeah.
08:52:34 <shapr> that'll save you from hours of snow exposure.
08:52:43 <tic> no snow around here, though.
08:52:54 <shapr> we just had a bunch of rain that washed out our snow.
08:53:01 <tic> but yeah. 25 km from school where I lived before, and now I think it's 5 km.
08:53:12 <tic> ah, crap. that sucks. I think snow should stick when it falls.
08:53:40 <shapr> well, I don't have a snow tire for my enhjuling yet, so I'm okay with it.
08:53:54 <Jad> is their modulus in haskell ?
08:53:55 <tic> ohh, cool.  I want one of those.  Where did you get it?
08:54:12 <shapr> @type mod
08:54:13 <lambdabot> mod :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
08:54:30 <Jad> i should define it first ?
08:54:33 <shapr> no, try mod
08:54:48 <Jad> k tnx
08:54:57 <Jad> Prelude> :t mod
08:54:57 <Jad> mod :: forall a. (Integral a) => a -> a -> a
08:54:57 <Jad> Prelude>
08:54:58 <Jad> tnx..
08:55:56 <Jad> @type Integral
08:56:49 <Jad> @type "Hello"
08:56:49 <lambdabot> "Hello" :: String
08:57:08 <Jad> shapr: on my interpreter ther is no String definition
08:57:18 <Jad> string is equivelent to [Char]
08:57:18 <shapr> Jad: String is actually [Char]
08:57:20 <Jad> is that okay ?
08:57:22 <Jad> ah okay..
08:57:32 <shapr> in Haskell, a String is a list of Char
08:57:56 <shapr> Jad: are you learning Haskell for school?
08:58:53 <Jad> nope
08:58:59 <Jad> am learning it alone..
08:59:06 <shapr> cool, do you have any questions?
08:59:38 <shapr> have you already seen http://www.haskell.org/learning.html ?
08:59:40 <Jad> not yet
08:59:47 <shapr> lambdabot has some useful learning tools as well.
08:59:49 <Jad> bet when i reach sockets i have lots of questions :P
08:59:55 <shapr> probably so
09:00:03 <Jad> shapr: i am reading a tutorial from haskell.org
09:00:09 <shapr> ah, excellent
09:00:20 <Jad> Yet another haskell tutorial
09:00:33 <shapr> ah, that's a good one
09:00:43 <shapr> Hal wrote most of it.
09:00:52 <Jad> ya...
09:01:10 <Jad> shapr: the question is is it easy to write real world applications in Haskell ?
09:01:16 <shapr> I think so.
09:01:20 <Jad> as easy  as C ?
09:01:23 <shapr> easier
09:01:31 <shapr> you have to manage memory and pointers in C
09:01:33 <Jad> i have to master it first..
09:01:40 <shapr> and you aren't able to reuse code as much
09:01:47 <Jad> yep
09:01:48 <shapr> and it's harder to make generic bits of code.
09:02:13 <Jad> i feel haskell can be more abstract and object oriented than C
09:02:28 <shapr> I don't think C is object oriented at all
09:02:29 <Jad> but i wonder why not so many people use for real world applications
09:02:39 <Jad> shapr: i meant more than Java
09:02:39 <shapr> and Haskell has something other than objects for structure
09:03:12 <Jad> k
09:03:19 <Jad> but i checked on freshmeat,
09:03:28 <Jad> their are like 50 projects written in haskell
09:03:42 <shapr> oh, I should create a freshmeat page for lambdabot 
09:04:02 <shapr> there's quite a bit of Haskell code out there
09:04:25 <shapr> anyways, read the tutorial, ask me (or others) questions when you get them.
09:04:27 <shapr> hi elmex 
09:04:30 <Jad> k
09:04:36 <Jad> be back later..
09:04:38 <Jad> to reading now..
09:04:50 <Jad> am still in Chapter 3
09:05:32 <shapr> you may also want to see the Haskell Wiki, http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
09:06:32 <elmex> skylan: hi
09:06:43 <Jad> k
09:07:03 <shapr> hi skylan 
09:07:33 <Jad|OFF> shapr: see ya later..
09:07:45 <TonyC> hallo
09:16:54 <shapr> hi TonyC 
09:18:16 <TonyC> Mmh, has nothing to do with haskell. But, is somebody of you familiar with unix? I'm trying to put a boot image on a zip disk - but rawrite doesn't do the job.
09:18:33 <TonyC> Good evening shapr. ;)
09:18:42 <shapr> I don't know how to create a bootable zipdisk
09:19:31 <TonyC> mmh, maybe dd will do it, i'll give it a try. 
09:51:13 <keir> does haskell have a tokenizer module?
09:53:30 <Smerdyakov> What do you mean?
09:55:11 <keir> ala java's StringTokenizer
09:55:27 <Smerdyakov> I don't know.
09:55:32 <Smerdyakov> All it takes is one function, though.
09:55:35 <Smerdyakov> Doesn't need a whole module.
09:55:40 <keir> ture
09:55:44 <keir> s/ture/true
09:56:08 <keir> i guess i could just stop being lazy and write one
09:58:45 <Smerdyakov> I think there is one in the standard library.
09:58:48 <Smerdyakov> SML has one. :-)
10:43:26 <Jad> is it possible to call C functions from haskell ?
10:47:39 <Cale> Jad, yeah, there's FFI - I've never used it though.
10:48:23 <Cale> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ffi/
13:20:43 <tomas> what function converts from String to Int?
13:21:29 <Smerdyakov> read
13:21:38 <Lor> Evening, folks.
13:21:40 <Smerdyakov> It's "overloaded," so you must sometimes use it like this:
13:21:43 <Smerdyakov> (read "1") :: Int
13:21:53 <tomas> ok
13:22:23 <Smerdyakov> You can do only read "1" if the context is enough to know that it must be of type Int.
13:23:04 <tomas> ok, thanks
13:32:02 <shapr> hi Lor!
13:32:20 <shapr> Lor: I had some question to ask you, but I've forgotten it.. it was something about dynamic type safety...
13:42:35 <crass> has anyone compiled ghc 6.0.1 with glibc 2.3.2?
14:04:47 <Jad> can any one explainto me in a nutshell how to use | ?
14:05:04 <Lor> No.
14:05:23 <Jad> lol
14:05:24 <Lor> A more verbose answer to a more verbosely described problem might be feasible, though.
14:05:24 <Jad> k
14:05:41 <Jad> actually am new to haskell
14:05:52 <Jad> and am reading about using |
14:05:56 <Jad> but i couldnt get it
14:06:09 <Jad> it's hard to unlearn the OO/imperative way of thinking once you already do it.
14:06:14 <Lor> What you probably mean is pattern matching.
14:06:23 <Lor> No, sorry, guards.
14:06:29 <Lor> (I lived for a moment in ML world)
14:08:26 <Jad> data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
14:08:50 <Lor> Ah, datatype declarations. Yes, that's another place where | is used.
14:09:11 <Jad> ya
14:09:14 <Jad> thats what am talking abt
14:09:17 <Smerdyakov> This has not much to do with imperative vs. functional, Jad.
14:09:26 <Jad> i know
14:09:38 <Jad> but Smerdyakov right now am switching to Fp
14:09:48 <Lor> So, for each type "a", there is a type "Maybe a", and values of that type can either be just "Nothing", or then "Just x" where x is a value of type a.
14:10:17 <Lor> Essentially, "Nothing" works like a null pointer or null reference.
14:10:31 <Lor> It's a way of saying "there is no value".
14:10:43 <Jad> got it :)
14:10:58 <Jad> tnx alot..
14:12:22 <emu> data Enumerated = Foo | Bar | Baz 
14:14:30 <Jad> data Tuple a b = One a | Two a b
14:16:56 <Jad> how to know the help comands from lambdabot
14:16:56 <Jad> ?
14:29:34 <TheDeath> I am finding problems installing hugs98.. Ths setup is stuck with no progress ... any help ?
14:30:11 <Jad> TheDeath: linux ?
14:30:32 <TheDeath> no windows 
14:31:33 <Jad> dunno
14:34:03 <Jad> TheDeath: why not try ghc ?
14:34:17 <Jad> you can run ghci as an interpreter..
14:38:26 <Smerdyakov> I've successfuly installed hugs98 under Windows in the past, however. I don't recall any difficulties.
14:43:47 <Jad> TheDeath: move to linux
14:44:45 <TheDeath> I thought sombody would say that :) 
14:49:06 <TheDeath> found a better way i just got the zip :) 
14:50:29 <Jad> good luck
14:51:45 <TheDeath> Thanks and good night, if it's night !
14:52:48 <esap> hmm.. was there some change in ghc old libraries support in some recent ghc version? I think one of the debian packages broke my ghc installation :-(
15:07:24 <Tomasso> what does the operatot <- mean?????
15:07:59 <Riastradh> It's not an operator.  It's part of the syntax of 'do'.
15:08:13 <Tomasso> hmmh what what does do do??
15:08:30 <Riastradh> Acts as syntactic sugar over >>=.
15:08:53 <Riastradh> do x <- y; a <- b; n    is equivalent to:
15:09:20 <Riastradh> let ok x = do { a <- b; n }; ok _ = fail "Pattern mismatch" in ok y
15:09:44 <kosmikus> well, <- is also part of the syntax for list comprehensions
15:10:50 <Tomasso> mhhm

15:13:38 <Jad> Riastradh: is it me that caused this ?
15:13:46 <Riastradh> I dunno.
15:14:13 <Jad> am really sorry if its me
15:15:21 <Jad> Can't find module `Socket'
15:15:24 <Jad> can any one help ?
15:15:28 <Riastradh> We're going to have to kidnap you and torture you for doing this.
15:16:06 <Jad> Riastradh: 
15:16:11 <Jad> i just download lambda bot
15:16:20 <Jad> will compile it and run it from here..

15:17:52 <Riastradh> You need to use the net packages somehow.  I forget how.
15:18:06 <Jad> guys any one know how to use the net package ?
15:18:19 <phubuh> Don't feel bad if you break lambdabot; finding bugs is a good thing :-)
15:18:45 <Jad> phubuh: how to compile with the net package ?
15:19:42 <phubuh> Sorry, I don't know
15:19:47 <Jad> argg
15:23:01 <Jad> Pseudonym: know how to compile with net ?
15:24:56 <Jad> good night guys..
22:15:09 * isomer is away: zozo
22:36:16 <Vardamir> are there any curry users on this channel? i thought i might try, since the fp part of curry is basically haskell
22:37:02 <Vardamir> discluding all the nice libraries
22:47:48 <Vardamir> with list comprehensions, is it possible to do: [(a,b,c) | a,b,c <- [1..n]] or something similar instead of having to do a <- [1..n] for each a,b,c etc?
23:26:36 <figment> Anyone in here willing to help a newbie?
23:59:17 <earthy> what's the Q?
