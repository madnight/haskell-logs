01:49:33 <modeless> Hi@all... Hopefully someone will be listening since I got a problem while learning Haskell...
01:51:56 <modeless> When declaring a class as a subclass of "Functor", ghci and hugs both complain with an error. First the code:
01:51:56 <modeless> class Functor a => Term a where
01:51:56 <modeless>     test :: a
01:51:56 <modeless> now the error message:
01:51:56 <modeless> TestFunctor.hs:1:
01:51:57 <modeless>  Kind error: `a' is not applied to enough type arguments In the class declaration for `Term'
01:52:01 <modeless>     Kind error: `a' is not applied to enough type arguments
01:52:03 <modeless>     In the class declaration for `Term'
01:53:33 <Lunar^> @prelude Functor
01:53:34 <lambdabot> ERROR: does not exist
01:53:34 <lambdabot> Action: connect
01:53:34 <lambdabot> Reason: Connection refused
01:53:38 <Lunar^> :(
01:55:10 <Lor> modeless, what is it you want to do?
01:55:41 <Lor> What kind of a concept is class "Term" supposed to express, and why do you think it is a subconcept of a "Functor"?
01:56:18 <modeless> I Just want to make a some datatype an instance of class functor. In my case a type representing a syntax tree. It is not that important to me, but it'd be nice to understand the reason, why my small testcase above does not work...
01:56:36 <Lor> And, in particular, what is "test" supposed to express?
01:57:04 <modeless> oh, this is just a small testcase. has nothing to mean. i didn't want to post all my source ;-)
01:57:10 <Lor> If you're just making up pieces of syntax with no purpose behind it, it's no wonder that something fails.
01:57:25 <Lor> In this case, your "test" has no sensible meaning as a functor.
01:59:09 <modeless> okay, i sense i don't understand sth. as i understand the type class Functor, it has one function, named "fmap". in this hypothetic case i want to say that a type a is a Term if it is a Functor (has function "fmap") and provides a function "test" with given signature. do i miss something?
02:01:04 <Lor> Yes. You still don't say what "test" is supposed to mean.
02:01:19 <Lor> And the signature you have given it is meaningless.
02:02:17 <Lor> The purpose of a programming language is to be able to express _meaningful_ computational concepts. It complains, quite validly, if you just give it some syntax without any thought about what it's supposed to express.
02:02:29 <Lor> So think. What is the class member "test" supposed to express?
02:02:56 <modeless> actually, test does not mean anything. but why is its signature meaningless? test should be a function returning sth of type "a", where "a" is a type being a Term and a Functor.
02:03:15 <Lor> "a" is not a type.
02:03:25 <Lor> That's where the "kind error" comes from.
02:03:39 <modeless> so what's "a"?
02:03:44 <Lor> If something is an instance of functor, it is not a type.
02:04:06 <Marvin--> damn.
02:04:24 <ddarius> modeless: If you instantiate Term with say Int, then fmap would have a type like, (a -> b) -> Int a -> Int b; if you instantiate with Maybe then test would have type Maybe
02:04:26 <Lor> fmap :: Functor a => (b -> c) -> a b -> a c
02:04:29 <ddarius> Neither of those make sense.
02:05:34 <Lor> For any "a" which is an instance of Functor, and any types "b" and "c", "fmap" is a function that takes a function from "b" to "c", and returns a function from "a b" to "a c".
02:06:02 <Lor> So "a" is something which is _applied_ to a type, to get a new type.
02:06:20 <Lor> Now, one instance of functor is "List".
02:06:24 * Marvin-- sighs
02:06:26 <Lor> is "List" a type?
02:06:46 <modeless> Okay, "List" should be a Type Constructor, as i understand...
02:07:07 <modeless> So in my case "a" is a Type Constructor, too. Right?
02:07:10 <Lor> (Well, "[]" to be accurate, but that's not legible)
02:07:30 <Lor> A _parameterized_ type constructor, yes.
02:07:41 <Lor> Even "Int" is a type constructor, it's just nullary (ie. takes no parameters).
02:08:19 <modeless> okay, even thought this really does not make sense. If I write "test :: a Int" in my case (ridiculous!) that should be okay for the type checker...
02:08:37 <modeless> Lor: Hey, thanks... now I understand the error message! :-)
02:08:38 <Lor> Yes.
02:08:53 <modeless> and another step towards understanding haskell :-)
02:12:30 <Lor> It's the first step towards higher-order thinking, at least.
02:13:20 <modeless> well, i have to confess that's a challenge if you come from years of imperative programming.
02:14:16 <Lor> I wouldn't say so. Higher-order thinking is in no way contradictory to imperative programming. It's just not exercised there.
02:14:33 <Lor> It's a new thing, yes, but doesn't require you to "unlearn" imperative techniques.
02:14:46 <Lor> Some _other_ things in functional programming do, though.
02:15:04 <modeless> well, it's always difficult to learn some advanced new technique.
02:15:34 <modeless> And i expect that thinking functional will also help programming in imperative languages. it's a new perspective, at least.
02:15:55 <modeless> of which things in fucntional programming do you think?
02:18:31 <Lor> Well, list travelsals are done a bit differently.
02:19:53 <modeless> hmm... right. but in my experience that's quite simple to learn. I find that I/O-Stuff with Monads, MonadTransformers etc. much more difficult to understand.
02:20:10 <shrimpx> monads are a doozie
02:20:26 <Lor> You don't need to understand monads to use them. :)
02:21:26 <modeless> well, not in depth... but if i start using MonadTransformers since I want to piggyback a State Monad on IO (resp. the other way round) it starts to get complicated imho compared to imperative languages.
02:21:59 <Lor> You don't want to do that. Unless you have _real_ good reason.
02:22:07 <ddarius> How can it be complicated compared to imperative languages?  Few imperative languages employ monads.
02:22:14 <Lor> If you do anything in the IO monad, you can just use IORefs to carry the state.
02:22:16 <Lor> Much simpler.
02:22:21 <ddarius> (or rather imperative programs)
02:22:35 <shrimpx> ddarius: they don't need monads to achieve basic I/O
02:22:38 <modeless> okay, thanks for the tip...
02:23:28 <ddarius> shrimpx: modeless said "but if I start using MonadTransformers", you do need monad transformers (and monads) to use monad transformers.
02:24:15 <modeless> ddarius: and imperative programs have a global state besides having easy I/O. Okay, the question is, where i need a global state, but there are indeed moments, when it is quite practical.
02:24:24 <shrimpx> i thought he meant that what he's doing in haskell gets much more complicated than the imperative equivalent
02:25:25 <Lor> modeless, if you want, you can do everything in imperative fashion, simply by doing everything in the IO monad.
02:25:25 <modeless> shrimpx: right, that's what i wanted to say. in my opinion the learning effort in a pure functional language is a bit higher than in imperative languages. at least if you are going to implement interative programs. well, my personal opinion.
02:25:55 <Lor> Haskell gives you the power to separate the pure parts from the imperative parts. You can use it if you want, but you aren't forced to.
02:25:58 <modeless> Lor, that's right - but why am I then programming in haskell and not say in c? ;-)
02:26:13 <ddarius> because IO actions are first class
02:26:20 <ddarius> strong static typing
02:26:23 <ddarius> laziness
02:26:45 <ddarius> garbage collection
02:26:54 <shrimpx> coolness
02:26:57 <shrimpx> :)
02:27:11 <modeless> shrimpx: :-) i think that's most counting ;-)
02:31:26 <shrimpx> i dunno.. i've yet to fully understand the role that the concept of 'monad' plays in haskell
02:39:50 <emu> well you see
02:39:55 <emu> it's a reflection of the universe
02:41:56 <shrimpx> :)
02:51:17 <lambdabot> Haskell: noone else is doing it
02:59:21 <Lor> That's again one of the misspellings I've never understood.
02:59:47 <Lor> I'd instinctively pronounce a word written "noone" the same way as "noon".
04:10:25 <shapr> hi frevidar 
05:04:11 <shapr> @yow
05:04:11 <lambdabot> Life is a POPULARITY CONTEST!  I'm REFRESHINGLY CANDID!!
05:04:20 <shapr> goood morning #haskell!
05:04:57 <shapr> how's the code treating everyone?
05:09:22 <Marvin--> badly
05:10:58 <Marvin--> I've figured out that the difference between  'ordered (x1:x2:xs) = x1 <= x2 && ordered (x2:xs)'  and  'ordered (x1:x2:xs) | x1 <= x2 = ordered (x2:xs) | otherwise = False'  is *huge* when I get down to the automatic proving
05:39:08 <shapr> hm, why would I get a BusError while ssh'd into a remote machine?
06:07:15 <juhp> shapr: was wondering if you have a config.xml sample for wiwiwi?
06:07:30 <shapr> I do
06:07:36 <juhp> cool
06:07:37 <shapr> hopefully..
06:11:25 <shapr> juhp: I have a patch to add ---- as <hr> to wiwiwi
06:11:33 <shapr> and I'm planning to add backlinks and images as  well.
06:12:19 <juhp> sounds good :-)
06:12:31 <shapr> I found a bug, nested lists don't work
06:13:12 <shapr> anyways, the author of wiwiwi, sebc, said he'd have time to send me the latest sources tomorrow
06:16:22 <andersca_> hello
06:16:28 <shapr> hej
06:16:41 <andersca_> shapr: do you know if there are functions for normalizing file paths in ghc?
06:16:46 <andersca_> or if we'll have to roll our own
06:17:23 <shapr> look at recent archives of libraries@haskell.org, they discuss that
06:17:28 <shapr> I can find the thread name for you
06:17:46 <andersca_> oh, cool
06:18:29 <shapr> ah, implementation of file-related modules
06:22:58 <andersca_> @prelude words
06:23:19 <lambdabot> ERROR: does not exist
06:23:19 <lambdabot> Action: connect
06:23:19 <lambdabot> Reason: Connection refused
06:23:47 <shapr> oh, I forgot to email him about that.
06:24:51 <andersca_> is there a more generalized words function
06:24:57 <andersca_> that lets you use an arbitary character
06:25:03 <juhp> wiwiwi is cute
06:25:05 <shapr> no, sadly not.
06:25:11 <shapr> juhp: yah I like it!
06:25:37 <shapr> and sebc wrote it in one evening or so
06:43:39 <shapr> juhp: hey, if the sourceforge software or something like it were installed on haskell.org, would you use it?
06:44:24 <juhp> shapr: yes, i guess so
06:44:31 <juhp> is that going to happen? :)
06:45:05 <shapr> it's something that might be proposed, but I want to investigate the various software first.
06:45:19 <juhp> i think we also need a news/weblog like site there
06:45:27 <shapr> yah, I agree.
06:45:44 <juhp> right
06:46:13 <shapr> I've installed gforge on raven.ScannedInAvian.org, but then the hard drive started dying
07:12:09 <shapr> isn't there a handy tool that checks installed debs for their md5sums?
07:22:35 * juhp tries emacs-wiki.el and likes it a lot :-)
07:22:42 <shapr> yah, emacs-wiki is nice.
07:22:56 <shapr> it has a lot of extra extended features that aren't enable by default.
07:23:06 <juhp> yeah, just what i've been looking for
07:23:18 <juhp> is there anything else like it?
07:23:24 <juhp> it is so
07:23:30 <shapr> in emacs? or just local wikis?
07:23:34 <juhp> emacsy :)
07:24:04 <juhp> in the sense of configurability
07:24:12 <juhp> ease of
07:24:20 <shapr> you can use emacs-wiki to edit remote wikis, as long as it recognized their syntax
07:25:02 <juhp> i'm just looking for an easy way of web publishing really
07:25:16 <shapr> oh, I'm using wiwiwi right now.
07:25:25 <shapr> that's why I want to add some features to it.
07:25:38 <juhp> i looked around a bit, but could really find anything to satisfy myself
07:25:52 <shapr> what are you looking for?
07:26:25 <juhp> the motivation was really to revamp the Hircules homepage
07:26:29 <juhp> for example
07:26:31 <Lunar^> damn
07:26:38 <shapr> hi Lunar^
07:26:44 <Lunar^> hi
07:26:46 * juhp is too lazy to write html...
07:26:59 <juhp> sorry completely OT ;)
07:27:07 <Lunar^> I've got a segfault :(
07:27:20 <Lunar^> HToolkit's MySQL binding is not that reliable
07:33:11 <Smerdyakov> OK, who wants me to advertise something cool but not related to Haskell?!
07:33:30 <shapr> Smerdyakov: what is this? Curry's Paradox?
07:34:09 <Smerdyakov> shapr, eh?
07:34:21 <shapr> sorry, just being a smartass as usual.
07:35:13 <Smerdyakov> Well I am going to give the link because the channel is quiet now! http://hcoop.net/abu/QuickSummary
07:36:37 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: Actually I'm invest on something similar
07:36:39 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: lautre.net
07:36:57 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, it's been hacked! THE TEXT IS ALL GIBBERISH!
07:37:16 <shapr> I just colocated my old desktop box at my friend's ISP.
07:37:30 <shapr> his colo is inexpensive.
07:37:45 <shapr> I do wish I had a 1U that was designed for colo
07:38:00 <Smerdyakov> I bet we're less expensive to provide the same services. :)
07:38:32 <shapr> one of his services is "walk to your colo site"
07:38:39 <shapr> I think you'll find that one hard to beat :-)
07:38:43 <Smerdyakov> One of ours is "pay $5 a month." :P
07:39:05 <shapr> but I don't have any dollars.
07:39:09 <shapr> only kronor!
07:39:19 <Smerdyakov> Oh yeah, and the company where it's hosted is socially constrained to continue offering service, in contrast to informal setups like the one you describe.
07:39:48 <keverets_> socially constrained?
07:40:13 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, yeah. Companies get bad reps when they deny service to paying customers arbitrarily. (Though they generally make you sign contracts that allow them to do it.)
07:40:37 <shapr> so far, my friend offers the best service I've ever seen.
07:40:47 <Smerdyakov> shapr, sure, until he changes jobs. :)
07:40:55 <shapr> he owns the ISP, so that seems unlikely.
07:41:08 <Smerdyakov> shapr, ah. That's a good setup, I guess. :)
07:41:29 <keverets_> but for the thousands of us who don't have friends who own ISPs, a coop might be a good idea.
07:41:37 <shapr> truly
07:41:39 <Smerdyakov> shapr, except for the added burden of maintaining your own server alone.
07:42:01 <shapr> I *want* to maintain my server myself. My years of being a sysadmin have shown me that no one else is reliable enough.
07:42:09 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, I can't read the page you linked. Can you tell me more?
07:42:24 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: It's a self-managed hosting service
07:43:12 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, how old and how many members now?
07:43:13 <shapr> plus managing my own server means that it's easy to run Haskell based and oriented services there.
07:43:22 <Smerdyakov> shapr, it's easy to do the same on ours.
07:43:33 <Smerdyakov> shapr, just not *exclusively* such services.
07:43:47 <shapr> that's understandable.
07:44:07 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: mhh 800 members for 2 years I think
07:44:24 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, cool!
07:44:32 <shapr> maybe we should form a meta-co-op called crypt.net
07:45:47 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, since you think it might be a good idea, do you want to join? :)
07:46:01 <TripleDES> hi
07:46:27 <shapr> hello TripleDES 
07:48:56 <keverets_> Smerdyakov: maybe... I couldn't find information on that site about exactly what's offered (how much disk space I would be able to use, how many and what type of mail accounts, how easy it is to control the DNS for my domain, etc, etc).
07:49:26 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, what kinds of restrictions on use are there? How easy is it to add a new web site? How easy is it to host a daemon you are developing yourself?
07:50:28 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, well, there are two answers. At the moment we have enough free space that you could use a few gigabytes of HD space and no one would notice. We haven't reached enough capacity yet to worry about dividing that up.
07:50:55 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, and you can set up all the mail accounts you want, control DNS, etc., instantly through command-line tools.
07:51:07 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, like above, limits will be imposed only when/if necessary.
07:51:51 <Smerdyakov> keverets_, the second kind of answer is that, as a coop, we obtain physical resources in response to member demand, and you can be involved in deciding how to expand hardwarewise if it becomes desirable.
07:52:04 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: You have to heard the whole story to understand
07:52:40 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: Someone known on the french alternative net scene called Valentin Lacambre owned a free web/mail/dns hosting service called Altern
07:53:54 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: One of the hosted website contained nude photos of Estelle Halliday, so she did a trial, and Valentin had to pay more than 100 000 euros
07:54:29 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: So he decided to stop the free web hosting service (but you can still get a free e-mail there)
07:55:11 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: But a lot of people were quite happy with what was provided, so they decided to set up something to go on
07:55:38 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: Valentin kindly gave a free server (named estelle !) to help the start
07:56:00 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: So it's mostly the same service as Altern (web, dns, mail, mailling-lists)
07:56:19 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, OK. So you can't run your own daemons?
07:57:46 <Lunar^> no
07:58:30 <Smerdyakov> OK. So there's a big difference from ours.
07:59:43 <TAndrad> hello@all
08:03:49 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: *nod*
08:07:56 <shapr> hi TAndrad 
08:08:41 <TAndrad> hi shapr
08:08:43 <TAndrad> how are you?
08:08:59 <TAndrad> are you ready to teach me something?
08:09:13 <shapr> no, I have to work right now.
08:09:16 <shapr> maybe someone else can help?
08:09:27 <TAndrad> :)
08:09:29 <TAndrad> yes
08:09:33 <TAndrad> no problem
08:14:30 <Lunar^> TAndrad: ask
08:15:21 <TAndrad> Lunar^ my question is what is a tail recursive function
08:15:42 <TAndrad> as far as i understand, is a recursive call that can be reduced to a linear loop
08:15:45 <Riastradh> A function that recurs only in tail positions.
08:16:07 <TAndrad> what that means?
08:16:28 <TAndrad> i mean how does the compiler decide if a function is tail recursive?
08:17:35 <Riastradh> The tail position of a body is the last place in it; the final function call; nothing need be done within the function after that call has returned.
08:31:55 <TAndrad> Riastradh got it
08:31:56 <TAndrad> thx
08:35:04 <sond> what's the easiest way to call haskell code from c? (with no assumptions about haskell and c compiler)
08:36:49 <shapr> I think that was recently discussed on the main mailing list
08:36:59 <sond> ok.. i'll have a look
08:37:08 <Lunar^> sond: ffi
08:37:16 <Lunar^> sond: I wrote something on the Wiki
08:37:30 <sond> ok.. ffi rings a bell
08:38:16 <Lunar^> http://haskell.org/hawiki/FfiTutorial
08:44:46 <sond> thanks
08:45:19 <sond> oh
08:45:23 <sond> i meant the other way around
08:46:19 <tic> shapr, look, another swede! *points at sond*
08:47:14 <sond> =)
08:47:29 <tic> sond, coming to the gasque today?
08:47:42 <Lunar^> sond: uhh sorry
08:49:21 <sond> tic, nej.. ‰r fortfarande ganska sjuk
08:49:40 <tic> sond, aww, crap. :/
08:49:43 <tic> sond, gratismat ju.
08:49:47 <sond> mm
08:51:39 <tic> ~/o What did you say? Atari Teenage Riot! ~/o
09:08:59 <harsha> hello everyone!
09:09:22 <Smerdyakov> harsha, how come you came online at the same instant as code_mutant?!
09:09:44 <harsha> Smerdyakov hehe.. 
09:10:10 <harsha> Smerdyakov  dunno, that must be coincedence..
09:10:51 <harsha> btw, i dont see code_mutant!
09:11:04 <Smerdyakov> He's not in this channel.
09:11:26 <harsha> at #hprog?
09:12:00 <Smerdyakov> Yes.
09:14:57 * harsha still wonders what has code_mutant got to do with him 
09:15:11 <harsha> don't see any direct relation.. 
09:15:42 <Smerdyakov> You joined at the same time, and your IP addresses match in the first and last numbers. :)_
10:12:45 <keverets_> Say I want to do a "case (x) of ; 0 -> 'a' ; 1 -> 'b' ; (...) ; 10 -> j" but instead of 10, match on hex A.  How do I say that in Haskell?
10:14:20 <andersca> hej sond, tic
10:15:57 <keverets_> ah, got it: "0xA -> 'j'"  Pretty standard stuff, really.
10:30:54 <keverets_> is there a synonym for "map toUpper"?
10:33:43 <ddarius> keverets_: I don't think so.  It hardly seems worthwhile.
10:34:12 <keverets_> ddarius: just curious.  Thought it might save a few keystrokes.
10:45:37 <shapr> jrosdahl: hej, skrivade du n√•gon Haskell?
10:45:47 <shapr> actually, I think that's not the correct past tense of wrote...
10:46:25 <shapr> I get "No priority (or zero) specific for pin" when I apt-get update, anyone know what that means?
10:46:34 <shapr> or how I can get rid of it?
10:48:22 <jrosdahl> shapr: skriva, skrev, skrivit. :)
10:49:10 <shapr> tackar
10:49:36 <shapr> skrev du n√•gon Haskell senare? (I senare == lately or recently)
10:49:40 <shapr> I think...
10:49:54 <shapr> jrosdahl: are you learning Haskell for fun or for school?
10:52:58 <jrosdahl> shapr: Well, I'm just reading about from time to time. I come from the O'Caml camp, or something.
10:53:43 <Riastradh> Haskell is sooooo much cooler than OCaml.
10:53:46 <shapr> ah, so you already have FP experienc.
10:56:23 <jrosdahl> shapr: Yeah, at least some. And I've known Lisp about 10 years or so.
10:56:38 <shapr> jrosdahl: have you tried any of fun laziness tricks with Haskell?
10:57:46 * shapr almost typed trickaren
10:57:46 <shapr> yikes, swedish is invading my brain
10:59:23 <jrosdahl> Apart from some simple [1..]-like constructions: no. I'm still in the reading phase. :)

11:53:47 <shapr> dunno if it's still there.
11:53:54 <raver> ok
11:54:10 * isomer takes notes
11:54:34 <shapr> ah, the Red Mountain Museum is a strange and fun place
11:54:57 <isomer> what's that?
11:55:28 <shapr> it chronicles the history of Birmingham, from the discovery of lots of iron ore to the name "Little Pittsburgh"
11:55:49 <isomer> neat
11:56:19 <isomer> thanks
11:56:29 <shapr> sure, if I think of other stuff I'll tell you.
11:57:01 <isomer> shapr: i think my dad really likes it there; he just put a bid in on a house
11:57:19 <shapr> it's a nice place, it's the largest country town I've seen.
11:58:00 <isomer> i've only spent two weeks there, and i really liked it too
11:58:17 <shapr> nice calm lifestyle, relaxed people. not much nightlife though.
11:58:46 <shapr> I'll be moving back there in the next few years myself.
11:59:07 <isomer> you mentioned that. we're gonna have to hook up. won't that be cool?
11:59:12 <shapr> yah :-)
11:59:15 <shapr> very cool
11:59:28 <shapr> we can do some Smalltalk pair programming, I hope.
11:59:38 <isomer> or haskell :)
11:59:43 <shapr> yes, that too!
12:00:21 <shapr> hiya Explodey 
12:00:25 <Explodey> hello
12:00:28 <shapr> how's life?
12:00:36 <Explodey> not bad, yourself?
12:03:26 <shapr> doing fine
12:03:27 <shapr> written any cool code recently?
12:09:38 <Explodey> Nothing very interesting
12:11:16 <phubuh> the makers of the game "Dragon's Lair" had to be insane
12:14:02 <shapr> why so?
12:14:55 <phubuh> it's absolutely impossible to get past the first screen :(
12:15:35 <phubuh> I downloaded it just now, thinking I'd be smarter than when I was five or so, but nope!
12:16:49 <Explodey> I always thought that game was a stupid idea (probably cos I was no good at it though)
12:17:15 <phubuh> did you get past the bridge with the dragon?
12:17:35 <Explodey> I can't remember.  I don't think so
12:18:48 <shapr> oh, that game
12:50:03 * shapr gives in to the lure of machinima
13:13:32 <phubuh> ah, super mario bros 3, that's a real gamwe
13:13:36 <phubuh> game, even
13:14:27 <ddarius> Damn skippy!
13:14:39 <Explodey> Oh yes I like that game
13:16:40 <phubuh> it's gotten harder :(
13:21:12 <shapr> this is really really fun to watch: http://www.redvsblue.com/bloodgulch.shtml
13:43:10 <lypanov> oh. wow
13:43:15 <lypanov> lots of people
13:43:17 <lypanov> nice people? ;-)
13:43:27 <shapr> hoi lypanov 
13:43:28 * Riastradh bites.
13:43:38 <shapr> Riastradh: what are you biting?
13:43:49 <shapr> lypanov: learning Haskell? looking for other users?
13:43:49 * Riastradh charges at shapr and bites a chunk out of his arm.
13:43:49 * lypanov has attempted to pick up the courage and learn haskell, but has always been scared away by the kind of complex intro documentation
13:43:55 <lypanov> i never thought there would be a community :)
13:44:13 <phubuh> some of us aren't even academics
13:44:16 <lypanov> wow :)
13:44:19 <lypanov> cool ;-)
13:44:36 <shapr> phubuh: doesn't academic just mean "someone who's going to school" ?
13:44:45 <lypanov> i'm currently just a normal ruby fanatic looking for ways to expand my coding thought patterns
13:44:55 <shapr> Haskell is a good way to stretch your brain
13:44:57 <lypanov> hopefully haskell will help me meature :)
13:45:05 <shapr> phubuh: are you an academic?
13:45:18 <phubuh> well, by that definition, I suppose I am
13:45:26 <shapr> I don't think I'm very mature myself. phubuh is more mature than I am.
13:45:46 <shapr> anyways, have you seen http://www.haskel.org/learning.html ?
13:45:50 <phubuh> lies!
13:46:05 <shapr> let's try that again
13:46:13 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
13:46:21 <phubuh> who's the one currently playing super mario bros 3 and yelling profanities?
13:46:34 <shapr> me me!
13:46:36 <lypanov> that'd be me
13:46:39 <lypanov> damnnit. too slow :)
13:46:52 <shapr> oh wait, I'm playing samurai shodown 4 and obscening.
13:46:56 <phubuh> oh shoot
13:47:17 <shapr> I think xmame has networkability, what do you play?
13:47:39 <phubuh> FCEU, SMB3 is a NES game
13:47:47 <phubuh> it has networkability too :-)
13:47:55 <shapr> lypanov: handy features here are the wiki http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
13:48:02 <shapr> the irc bot
13:48:04 <shapr> @yow
13:48:05 <lambdabot> YOW!!  I'm in a very clever and adorable INSANE ASYLUM!!
13:48:27 <shapr> I'm sure there's something else I've forgotten.
13:48:33 <lypanov> lol. nice and friendly bot :)
13:48:40 <shapr> oh! there's haskell-libs
13:48:48 <shapr> something like a cvs-wiki for #haskell
13:48:49 * ddarius goes and gets his Super Mario Bros 3 NES -cartridge- and NES system.
13:49:59 <phubuh> ddarius: bah!  my NES system broke ages ago.  it was practically on its deathbed when it wouldn't play anything unless there was a ping pong raquet in its mouth
13:50:14 <lypanov> nice
13:50:34 <lypanov> haskell.org shows a khtml bug that i thought had been fixed already :)
13:52:27 <phubuh> YES!
13:55:45 <phubuh> ooh, the ship level at the end of world 1 is so cool
13:57:06 <ddarius> The hammer suits in the World 5 are cool.
13:57:44 <shapr> `john: are you a macro?
14:00:20 <shapr> lypanov: so, what programming languages do you use? are you a professional programmer?
14:02:10 <phubuh> whee, world #2
14:06:25 <lypanov> shapr: professionally: perl mainly, c++ before that, php before that, c before that, some ruby all the way through for side projects
14:06:43 <lypanov> shapr: non professionally: c++/kde/qt, ruby
14:06:53 <shapr> sounds nice
14:07:05 <shapr> I've done Visual Basic, Java and Python professionally.
14:07:13 <shapr> I'm still doing Python for money.
14:07:22 <lypanov> not too bad
14:07:40 <lypanov> perl is just terrible though unfortunately
14:07:46 <lypanov> everything else i can just put up with
14:07:59 <shapr> I like to learn programming languages that stretch my thinking. Haskell has been the best for that so far.
14:08:23 <lypanov> thats my main reason for giving it a try in the near future
14:08:30 <lypanov> just collecting reference info for the moment
14:08:44 <shapr> you could start now :-)
14:08:52 <shapr> do you have GHC or Hugs installed?
14:08:53 <lypanov> too close to christmas and kde release to really get into it for the moment :(
14:14:22 <shapr> ok
14:15:17 <`john> shapr: if you think macos are for all intents and purposes 'real'.
14:15:45 <`john> now at: level 6, depth= [326] exten = 5Delta.
14:18:24 <shapr> why wouldn't macros be real?
14:18:35 * shapr waits for the punchline
14:22:52 <`john> well because you do not have any crows. :)
14:24:27 <shapr> I don't get it.
