01:56:24 <ham[home]> hiho
03:32:00 <TripleDES> morning
03:34:40 <ayrnieu> morning, des.
03:52:14 <ham[home]> shapr: you there?
03:52:29 <ham[home]> Igloo: you there?
03:56:19 <shapr> y0
03:56:53 <ham[home]> that exaple you gave me for hgl is quite strange imho
03:57:15 <ham[home]> the draw routine in the draw callback is useless
03:57:26 <ham[home]> actually the whole drawcallback is
03:57:45 <ham[home]> anything is handeld with the timer callback
03:58:07 <ham[home]> but i cant rewrite the code in a way that the draw callback handles everything
03:58:35 <ham[home]> is it possible that in the internal code that the drawcallback isnt called properly?
03:58:54 <Igloo> Do you mean display callback?
03:59:13 <ham[home]> the displayCallback
03:59:19 <ham[home]> displayCallback $= (display ref)
03:59:32 <Igloo> It's used when the window is revealed, isn't it?
04:00:01 * Igloo is no OpenGL expert, so it could be badly (or at least non-standardly) written
04:00:07 <ham[home]> it should be used all the time
04:00:32 <ham[home]> so that display is an init draw?
04:00:36 <Igloo> Oh, do you mean the timer one should be pushing a display event/
04:01:01 <ham[home]> the displaycallback should be called in each loop of the main loop
04:01:05 <ham[home]> sec
04:01:17 <ham[home]>    setDisplayCallback (display day year)
04:01:18 <ham[home]>    setReshapeCallback (Just reshape)
04:01:18 <ham[home]>    setKeyboardMouseCallback (Just (keyboard day year))
04:01:19 <ham[home]>    mainLoop
04:01:29 <ham[home]> this is from that other haskel program thing
04:01:37 <ham[home]> there is no timer active
04:01:54 <ham[home]> haskell
04:01:56 <Igloo> If there's no timer then you can't do the sort of animation this does
04:02:13 <ham[home]> why?
04:02:16 <Igloo> (well, except by sleeping)
04:02:38 <ham[home]> it should to the job when i copy the code form the timer to the display
04:02:53 <ham[home]> since that gets also called in the main loop
04:03:12 <Igloo> But then the speed will be proportional to CPU
04:03:18 <ham[home]> or am i wrong :)?
04:03:57 <ham[home]> the prob is nothing is moving if i copy the code to the display callback
04:04:07 <ham[home]> as if it isnt called in the mainloop
04:04:33 <ham[home]> (r_x, r_y, r_z) <- readIORef x
04:04:34 * Igloo doesn't really see what you think the problem is with it as it is written
04:04:54 <ham[home]> i mean there are two draws
04:04:58 <ham[home]> one in the drawcallback
04:05:02 <ham[home]> and one in the timer
04:05:07 <Igloo> What do you mean by a draw?
04:05:09 <ham[home]> if i delete the one in the draw callback
04:05:23 <ham[home]> or all operations in the drawcallback
04:05:27 <ham[home]> then nothing changes
04:05:36 <ham[home]> draw_colourful_cube x
04:06:16 <Igloo> It's possible draw_colourful_cube x; swapBuffers; flush should be replaced with something that generates a display event, but apart from that it looks OK to my untrained eye
04:06:24 <Igloo> (in inc_anim)
04:06:50 <ham[home]> yes but i think that draw should do something at all
04:07:10 <ham[home]> is seems as if that drawcallback isnt called at all in the main loop
04:07:29 <Igloo> It'll be called whenever a display event happens
04:07:30 <ham[home]> if i kill the drawcube in the timer
04:07:37 <ham[home]> then nothing changes
04:09:08 <ham[home]> hm
04:11:51 <raver> hi
04:53:48 <shapr> so, what's going on today?
04:56:41 * Lor is making food.
04:56:50 <ayrnieu> I spent the last few days installing a Gentoo system (and compiling the entire system in the process).  I like it.  Very comfy in Enlightenment, right now.
04:58:03 <Lor> I also _should_ make a poster that describes my compressor project, but I don't feel very motivated.
04:59:18 <shapr> ayrnieu: I just apt-build in Debian
05:00:20 <ayrnieu> shapr =)  OK.  Gentoo basically fulfills everything I ever wanted in a Linux distribution, but I don't feel like converting anyone.
05:03:25 <shapr> what's different between Gentoo and Debian?
05:06:14 <shapr> I switched to Debian from RedHat because the dependency tracking is so much better in Debian
05:06:25 <ayrnieu> Well, during one of the largish compiles yesterday I started another one to get links -- but since I hadn't compiled X, yet, I compiled links without that feature.  About an hour ago, after getting comfortable with Enlightenment, I recompiled links with X support.  In Gentoo many packages have related USE settings (set in /etc, or in environment variables) that I can play with to get different feature sets and dependencies.  Everything that I compile gets 
05:06:27 <shapr> the only thing I know about Gentoo is that you compile stuff from source.
05:06:40 <ayrnieu> -- unless the package overrides this, for known-broken flags.
05:06:50 <ayrnieu> yeah, that has a lot to do with it.
05:07:09 <Lor> Doesn't seem very practical if you have a slow machine.
05:07:26 <shapr> so, for you, the advantage is that you get extra customization when compiling from source?
05:07:48 <ayrnieu> Lor - slow machines don't seem very practical, either.
05:08:04 <ayrnieu> but surely my 300Mhz qualifies as that =)
05:08:15 <mwb> No shoe is meant for every foot.
05:08:29 <shapr> mwb: sure, no argument there
05:08:39 <shapr> I'm just wondering what the differences are, I really don't know.
05:08:50 <shapr> no holy war intended :-)
05:08:56 <ayrnieu> shapr - that, and other things.  I've compiled my entire system -- every single emerge except for a binary CMUCL and a Sun JDK, with -mcpu=i686 -Os
05:09:17 <ayrnieu> The result works amazingly well.
05:10:19 <shapr> I tried rebuilding a bunch of debs with apt-build, the only package that seemed to have a noticeable speed change was mozilla related browser.
05:10:25 <mwb> Portage could be better.
05:10:25 <shapr> er "browsers"
05:10:52 <mwb> Per-app use-flags that are remembered wouldn't hurt.
05:10:57 <shapr> I compiled with -march=athlonmp -O2 or something like that
05:11:45 <mwb> Sometimes I don't want to merge a package with support for something and USE="-whatever" emerge could be made more automatic.
05:12:20 <mwb> Portage can sometimes be pretty slow.
05:12:34 <mwb> Either during queries or dependency stuff.
05:12:36 <ayrnieu> mwb - it doesn't bother me, but OK.  I've done a lot of that in recent days, but the nature of packaging systems seems to imply that you use them less frequently over time.
05:12:46 <mwb> I like Portage.
05:12:55 <mwb> I'm just thinking out loud.
05:13:10 <shapr> from my viewpoint, binary debs let me increase my speed of change
05:13:24 <shapr> I can install a bunch of things, try them, and rip them out if they're boring.
05:13:32 --- topic: set to '["We put the Funk in Funktion","See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/","Learning Haskell - http://www.haskell.org/learning.html","lots of cool debs in the haskell-experimental archive - see http://www.syntaxpolice.org/haskell-experimental/haskell-experimental.html","new HC&A Report - http://www.haskell.org/communities/","Any user who would like to request any unwritten tutorial please msg shapr"]' by asdfsdfasdfhg
05:13:50 <asdfsdfasdfhg> shapr: how is the tutorial writing going on ?
05:14:08 <shapr> haven't done anything lately, been writing Python for money.
05:14:15 <ayrnieu> I'd like esearch to work -- but its Python uepdatedb that ties into Python portage libraries (not to blame the language!) has such a fantastically horrible slow mind-numbing crawling speed that I could start it now, go to sleep, and probably find it just finishing when I wake up.  Yegads.
05:14:21 <ayrnieu> shapr - writing what?
05:14:37 <shapr> I build zope/plone sites for a living
05:14:48 <shapr> so it's just webmonkey work
05:15:05 <ayrnieu> ah.  For who?
05:15:19 <shapr> install a plone site, customize the look and feel, install messageboards, client databases, etc
05:15:34 <mwb> Seems like their could be worse jobs.
05:15:39 <mwb> 'there
05:16:06 <shapr> We have three clients at the moment, a uni in sweden and a uni in germany, and an EU project consortium in brussels/athens
05:16:29 <shapr> going to meetings is always fun
05:16:46 <shapr> Athens was quite an experience.
05:17:44 <shapr> anyways, I'd much rather be using a web app system in Haskell
05:17:51 <shapr> but I haven't gotten around to writing one.
05:18:09 <shapr> I haven't used WASH enough to know what it can do.
05:18:18 <ayrnieu> What would it such a system entail?
05:18:32 <shapr> but I suspect I want something like an HWS-WP plugin version of WASH
05:19:37 <shapr> a web app platform usually means something that integrates database, web server, site management, virtual hosts, user management, etc etc
05:21:00 <shapr> the best ones have a central 'mindset' that permeates the whole thing, maybe conceptual unity is a better term.
05:22:35 <shapr> I find it easier to write code in Haskell, because the state is all in one place, rather than all over the place.
05:22:58 <shapr> I wonder if that difference could make a really spiffy web dev server.
05:23:08 <Lor> For web programming, I find it hard to imagine a more ideal language than scheme.
05:23:21 <shapr> what's ideal about scheme?
05:23:22 <Lor> All right, scheme with static typing would be even better. :)
05:23:43 <Lor> It gives you a neat and concise syntax for describing syntax trees, eg. html/xml documents.
05:23:48 <ayrnieu> I helped a very new programmer understand some C earlier today by writing a pseudoC with the IO states explicitly threaded through this person's program.  Odd experience.
05:23:49 <shapr> yah, I love the ease of use of dynamic typing, but Zope sure irritates me when it gets an obvious runtime error.
05:24:00 <Lor> It has quasiquote, which is a very convenient way of inserting code in the middle of data.
05:24:17 <Lor> It has continuations, which are a real boon when modeling the interaction with the client.
05:24:51 <Lor> And macros make many things even easier to express.
05:25:36 <Lor> In general it has potential for much greater efficiency than a haskell-based web program, for various reasons.
05:26:06 <shapr> I can see that scheme would be good for webdev, but I would argue that Haskell can be equally efficient.
05:26:07 <ayrnieu> I suppose that a Scheme with a (CMUCL) python-like compiler and CL type assertions would work better.
05:26:55 <shapr> of course, it's all words until we write some webdev systems and compare them.
05:27:12 <Lor> Yes. Naturally Haskell _can_ be equally efficient, but I think it requires much more sophisticated machinery.
05:28:12 <shapr> well, are there any webdev systems in scheme?
05:28:27 <Lor> What counts as a "webdev system"?
05:28:32 <shapr> I dunno
05:28:54 <shapr> it would be interesting to compare hws-wp and/or WASH to some scheme based stuff.
05:29:46 <Lor> There's brl: http://brl.sf.net/
05:29:54 <Lor> Then there's PLT scheme's web server and servlet framework.
05:30:11 <shapr> have you used them?
05:30:21 <Lor> Not much, I'm afraid.
05:30:22 <shapr> hi shawn 
05:30:59 <shapr> I've used hws-wp a bit, it's basically a haskell webserver with mod_apache
05:31:10 <shapr> WASH does a lot of stuff, I only know about some of it.
05:34:56 <shapr> we should do a coding comparison, would be informative
05:37:20 <shapr> something like "hello world" would be a good start
05:41:14 <shapr> cool, WASH uses mptc and fundeps to model the DTD info
05:42:49 <shapr> instance AddTo DL DD allows add :: ELT DL -> ELT DD -> ELT DL
05:45:10 * esap just wrote a natural number monad :-)
05:45:35 <Lor> Fundeps have the smell of a hack, since they're used to simulate dependent types.
05:53:47 <shapr> what would be better?
05:54:12 <Lor> Well, um, dependent types. :)
06:26:52 <shapr> hi ustenzel 
06:27:01 <ustenzel> hello
06:27:06 <shapr> what's up?
06:27:31 <ustenzel> not much.
06:27:40 <shapr> written any fun code lately?
06:27:44 <ustenzel> have been abusing gtk2hs a bit.
06:27:55 <shapr> oh, that's fun
06:28:05 <ustenzel> ...which resulted in me not liking gtk+ any more.
06:28:16 <shapr> why?
06:28:52 <ustenzel> well, it feels imperative, probably b/c it is.
06:29:01 <ustenzel> and somehow everything depends on everything
06:29:35 <shapr> is there something better?
06:29:35 <ustenzel> i find myself passing around IO-actions for each and everything, some of them as record members just so i can name them
06:29:52 * ustenzel dreams of a library that uses mvc
06:30:14 <shapr> maybe you can write a tiny demo of an MVC library?
06:30:39 <ustenzel> maybe...
06:31:20 <ustenzel> the Haskell Ports Library looks promising
06:32:50 <ustenzel> fresco.org has a nice looking lib.  primarily c++, but they use corba.
06:33:18 <ustenzel> it's a shame the project is almost dead.  their structured graphics look like a natural fit to haskell
06:36:10 <shapr> didn't fresco become the berlin-project.org ?
06:37:38 <ustenzel> it did.  and then the berlin-project became fresco again...
06:37:44 <shapr> oh
06:38:22 <ustenzel> "because it had grown into something bigger than before" -- yeah, but it is still unusable.
06:38:28 <shapr> :-/
06:38:35 <shapr> I'd like to try something other than X
06:38:50 <ustenzel> who doesn't?
06:39:46 <ustenzel> but there isn't much.  fresco look promising but doesn't make progress, so there are only some tookits for the frame buffer left.
06:40:33 <shapr> well, someone forked X recently
06:40:54 <shapr> I think they said they'll make a bunch of incompatible changes in hopes of making beneficial changes
06:42:35 <ustenzel> it's a fork of xfree86.  whatever comes out of this will be better than xfree86 but it will still be X.
06:43:27 <ustenzel> ...which wouldn't be too bad, if there wasn't the tower of extensions built on extensions of extensions.
06:43:52 <shapr> sounds like we need a refactoring browser for protocols
06:56:29 <ustenzel> concerning the recent discussion about string representation: has anyone ever considered ropes?
06:57:12 <Lor> I don't recall the discussion, but I think that there are several different uses that require different kinds of "strings".
06:57:19 <Lor> Ropes are a good option for certain uses.
06:58:42 <ustenzel> at least ropes could reasonably interface to c libraries, can be manipulated (mostly) in a functional way and are way more flexible than simple arrays
06:59:07 <ustenzel> could such a beast be implemented in/for haskell?  or with common extensions?
06:59:32 <Lor> Some kinds of ropes, definitely.
06:59:42 <Lor> Making it directly interfacable with C would be a bit difficult, I guess.
07:00:16 <Lor> I don't really see the point with that. Few C libraries use ropes in their interfaces.
07:00:42 <ustenzel> i see one particular useful one that almost does: iconv
07:01:44 <shapr> I have a cheesy suggestion, can we do the Array IOArray thingy with String and PackedString?
07:02:08 <ustenzel> imagine a library for binary IO that produces a (Rope Word8), then call iconv on that to give a (Rope Char), operate on that, convert back and output again.  not a single Haskell list involved!
07:03:39 <Lor> How often does a program really need ropes?
07:03:58 <ustenzel> Uhm... as often as it needs strings?
07:04:06 <Lor> They're okay for editors, and things that do weird text-munging, but for most practical uses I don't see the point.
07:04:09 <shapr> maybe we can sponsor some research to allow GHC to automatically convert to PackedString internally :-)
07:04:33 <shapr> I like the elegance of strings as a list of Char, that really appeals to me
07:04:43 <ibid> elegance?
07:04:47 <shapr> so if there's a way to make it faster, that would be cool, but I'd like to keep the feature.
07:04:54 <Lor> As long as strings aren't huge, an ordinary shared-substring-of-char-array representation ought to suffice pretty well.
07:04:56 <shapr> sure, it's great for recursive processing
07:05:07 <shapr> ibid: is there something better?
07:05:49 <ibid> the list of chars approach is elegant mainly when using infinite or partially evaluated strings
07:05:54 <Lor> If there was a common collection framework (such as Edison), then strings could just be defined as the class of character sequences.
07:06:21 <Lor> Then you could just use ordinary specialization for the common cases.
07:06:36 <shapr> one of the original sexy points I saw about Haskell is that it's built from so few basic pieces, and no separate String type was another example of that simplicity to me. 
07:06:42 <ustenzel> Lor: what methods would a sequence have?  just head and tail?
07:06:50 <Lor> Have a look at Edison.
07:07:12 <shapr> well, Pseudonym is the man for Edison, so he can probably hook you up with CVS commit privs :-)
07:07:42 <ibid> shapr: for many uses, arrays are better
07:08:26 <Lor> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/edison/users006.html
07:08:34 <ustenzel> ibid: really?  with all that reallocation and everything suddently being in the IO monad?
07:08:54 <Lor> IO? Huh?
07:09:26 <Lor> It's much easier to reallocate a single array than reallocate a gazillion list nodes.
07:09:46 <Lor> But I do think that shared substrings should be supported. Takes less space.
07:09:52 <ibid> true
07:09:57 <Lor> And makes the substring operation faster.
07:10:17 <Lor> Only if you start doing lots of concatenations, then ropes become essential.
07:10:19 <ibid> hmm, a list of spans with a text scroll would be cool :)
07:10:42 <Lor> text scroll?
07:10:50 <ibid> xanadu terminology :)
07:11:07 <Lor> Ah, that weird zigzag stuff?
07:11:15 <ibid> related, yes
07:11:25 <ustenzel> Lor: yes, IO.  or ST.  you don't want to use immutable arrays for strings, do you?
07:11:28 <ibid> a text scroll is an append-only store of characters
07:11:56 <Lor> ustenzel, why not?
07:12:29 <Lor> So you don't want to use immutable lists for strings either?
07:14:05 <shapr> gzigzag is very nifty
07:14:07 <shapr> too bad it's java
07:14:16 * shapr stabs java with dull stick
07:14:32 <ustenzel> Lor: you'd have to copy the whole array just to change a single character.  way too expensive.
07:14:33 <shapr> *stab* *stab*
07:14:41 <ibid> shapr: gzigzag is no more
07:14:43 <shapr> actually, Python does that already
07:14:46 <shapr> ibid: what happen?
07:14:52 <ibid> shapr: patents
07:14:56 <shapr> !!
07:15:01 <Lor> ustenzel, depends on how you use those.
07:15:09 <Lor> It's very rare to want to change a single character.
07:15:20 <shapr> even for single char changes, it's fast enough in Python.
07:15:34 <ustenzel> Lor: but it's common to change something.
07:15:42 <ibid> the project moved to RDF and is now called fenfire
07:15:46 <Lor> I can't recall doing it very much.
07:15:49 <shapr> the only case where it gets troublesome is something like 'foo' + 'bar' + 'baz' + 'quux' where you recreate it three times
07:15:58 <ibid> shapr: http://www.nongnu.org/fenfire/
07:16:38 <shapr> in cases like that in Python, it's faster to do it all at once with '%s%s%s%s' % ('foo','bar','baz','quux')
07:16:45 <Lor> I think it might be better to have a separate system for building strings, rather than spending effort making all concatenations be efficient.
07:16:48 <shapr> ibid: looks spiffy
07:16:57 <Lor> Eg. in java there are stringbuffers.
07:17:09 <shapr> what about PackedString?
07:17:25 <Lor> PackedString is, um, not good for much.
07:17:43 <Lor> For I/O it's okay, but not for manipulatiing.
07:20:43 <ibid> in situations where packed strings make sense, it would make as much sense to replace strings with symbols
07:21:08 <Lor> Um, no point interning stuff that's only used in I/O.
07:21:29 <ibid> i wasn't thinking about transput
07:21:41 <shapr> fenfire looks perfect for the research paper wiki I've been thinking about.
07:21:58 <ibid> shapr: #fenfire @ ircnet
07:22:00 <Lor> ibid, about what, then?
07:22:59 <ibid> Lor: eg. language processors
07:23:25 <Lor> Uh? Why would you use packedstrings in them?
07:24:16 <ibid> i would use symbols in them, which was my point :)
07:33:00 <shapr> ham[home]: written any other Haskell OpenGL code?
07:34:54 <ham[home]> nope not yet
07:35:48 <ham[home]> i need to get some background in haskell first :)
07:36:10 <ham[home]> do you happen to know if there are buffers that i can access in that module?
07:36:11 <shapr> yah, that could be handy.
07:36:32 <ham[home]> and i want to understand the madas first
07:36:34 <ham[home]> er
07:36:35 <ham[home]> monads
07:36:42 <shapr> I do not know, but I would just do 'fgrep -i buffer *' in the root of the source tree for HOpenGL
07:36:52 <ham[home]> right
07:36:55 <shapr> monads are pretty simple, have you seen the nomaware tutorial?
07:37:02 <ham[home]> i also can have a look at the site:)
07:37:14 <ham[home]> i got that site yep
07:37:21 <ham[home]> havent had tome though to read it yet
07:37:24 <Marvin--> "monads are pretty simple", this from the guy we had to explain it to over and over again :-P
07:37:33 * Marvin-- smiles at shapr :)
07:37:36 <shapr> Marvin--: well, now that I sort of understand them :-)
07:37:48 <shapr> it was hard to retrain myself out of the imperative mindset.
07:38:09 <shapr> many thanks to dennisb, Heffalump, Igloo, Marvin--, etc for helpful explanations :~)
07:38:09 <ham[home]> i think there is nothing special mathematically
07:38:17 <ham[home]> just the application has to be shown
07:38:33 <ham[home]> and that is why i want a tutorial that goes from that to application
07:38:40 <ham[home]> and not vica versa
07:39:43 <ham[home]> shapr: have you had a look at my codemages design doc?
07:40:43 <shapr> no, I haven't
07:40:48 <shapr> at least, not recently.
07:41:07 <ham[home]> i would like to have a nice framework in haskell that enables you to do rendering like in mathematica or so
07:42:45 * Marvin-- reads all his old notes from the project and says "duh" many times
07:44:03 <ham[home]> Marvin--: what project?
07:45:01 <Marvin--> ham[home]: oh, my degree project to encode haskell programs in first order logic
07:45:17 <ham[home]> ah
07:45:53 <Marvin--> I'm reading my old notes that say "hey, let's do this" and then a week later it says "duh, obviously that won't work, gotta do THIS instead"
07:46:05 <Marvin--> again, and again, and again :)
07:46:07 <ham[home]> yeah
07:46:16 <ham[home]> thats research
07:49:02 <Marvin--> yay, snooker on TV
07:49:11 <ham[home]> :)
07:51:24 <dennisb> Oh, snooker. I want to see that, I can program some other day....
07:52:17 <Marvin--> "We don't have any sound from the arena right now, but at least we've got visual!"
07:52:33 <dennisb> I heard that
07:53:21 <Marvin--> now where's Igloo? I have to taunt him for sucking at pool :-P
07:53:28 <dennisb> I'm a big snooker fan, but have never ever played it myself
07:53:34 <Marvin--> me neither
07:53:40 <Marvin--> there aren't that many snooker tables in Sweden
07:53:40 <opet> snooker without sound? brilliant! I don't have to listen to stupid commentry now!
07:53:47 <Jado> lambdabot wer are you ?
07:53:49 <opet> "ooh, he wanted to pot that ball"
07:53:56 <Marvin--> opet :)
07:56:19 * Marvin-- wanders off in search for coffee
08:03:00 <shapr> Jad: lambdabot is dead.
08:03:08 <TAndrad> hi shapr
08:03:12 <shapr> hopefully I'll have a new box colocated this week.
08:03:15 <shapr> hi TAndrad 
08:03:31 <ibid> shapr: considered a virtual box? :)
08:03:42 <shapr> eh?
08:05:19 <ibid> shapr: user-mode linux based virtual box
08:05:26 <shapr> oh
08:05:32 <shapr> wouldn't help me with a dead hard drive.
08:05:38 <ibid> true :)
08:06:11 <shapr> I have been tempted to buy a rack-mount box
08:06:24 <shapr> but I'd rather save up for a 4-opteron box
08:06:58 <TAndrad> shapr for what purpose?
08:07:06 <shapr> web development, of course!
08:07:10 * shapr cackles evilly
08:07:17 <Jad> shapr: why ?
08:07:31 <Jad> to mirror a whole site wget - what ?
08:07:36 <shapr> mostly because I like the 2-cpu box I have now, and I'd like to try a 4-cpu desktop box.
08:07:42 <TAndrad> shapr in order to run Notepad to edite .html files? :))
08:08:39 <shapr> I think that multiple processors is the way of the future, so I want to learn about it ahead of time.
08:08:52 <shapr> now I know about 2 cpus, next I want to try 4
08:09:00 <TAndrad> there is not too much thing to learn about..
08:09:14 <TAndrad> shapr beside this.. you seem to have a lot of money to spare :P
08:09:19 <shapr> heh
08:09:20 <opet> I'm sure emacs works really differently on a 4 cpu box
08:09:27 <opet> :P
08:09:39 <shapr> emacs is single-threaded :-(
08:09:42 <shapr> that's one of its warts
08:09:47 <TAndrad> how many threads uses emacs?
08:09:53 <TAndrad> i thinked that too..
08:10:13 <TAndrad> what you need for emacs is a faster hardrive
08:10:27 <Jad> to mirror a whole site wget -what ?
08:10:43 <shapr> what's going on with these connection resets?
08:10:55 <Jad> probably under ddos
08:10:59 <shapr> oh
08:11:01 <shapr> fun
08:11:31 <shapr> it's more that I want to learn about using SMP machines
08:11:46 <shapr> I've learned that a lot of things are different with 2 cpus
08:12:03 <shapr> first of all, the Intel architecture really really sucks
08:12:14 <TripleDES> hey
08:12:20 <Jad> hey
08:12:26 <shapr> you have stuff to think about like cache coherency, IO-APICs, etc
08:13:23 <Marvin--> heh, Hendry pretty much snookered himself
08:13:26 <shapr> I'm tempted to buy a different arch next time, but sadly, they're much more expensive.
08:14:09 <shapr> I wish Alphas were still being developed :-(
08:15:06 <ustenzel> I'm tempted to buy a powerpc.  probably the only serious alternative platform.
08:15:28 <Jad> to mirror a site any one know wget -what ?
08:15:57 <shapr> I wonder whether IBM is planning on making desktop SMP versions of their NUMA arches
08:16:49 <Marvin--> Jad: have you tried man wget?
08:16:50 <TripleDES> shapr: Im looking for some used non-i386 boxes
08:17:26 <Jad> ya
08:17:30 <Jad> Marvin--: too long
08:17:37 <shapr> TripleDES: you can get alphas and sparcs on ebay
08:17:54 <Marvin--> Jad: it's been ten minutes since you started asking, I think you would've been able to read the man page in that time
08:17:59 <Marvin--> Jad: and there's this thing called "search"
08:18:15 <Jad> nope
08:18:19 <Marvin--> Jad: it may not be called mirroring, but perhaps recursive fetching or something?
08:18:22 <TripleDES> yes, I've been looking this morning and I've seen sgi's indy, sparc stations...
08:18:55 <TripleDES> could be nice to have something out of Intel/AMD at home
08:19:03 <Jad> ya
08:19:09 <shapr> yah, I agree. I'd like to try another arch.
08:21:40 <shapr> hm, the IBM Power4+ starts at $16,000 USD, and can be expanded to 4-way
08:22:11 <Jad> Marvin--: i tried the -r (recursive) yet only downloaded index.html
08:22:22 <Jad> i tried --mirror and only downloaded index too..
08:23:07 <shapr> right now my budget would cover a trip to the ice cream store maybe...
08:29:22 <Marvin--> Jad: I think you have to give --force-html or something too
08:30:09 <Jad> Marvin--: the problem is that i was wgeting from an ftp server
08:30:51 <Marvin--> oh
08:35:24 <shapr> hello scarface
08:35:35 <bluedazzle> hello shapr.. how are you?
08:35:42 <shapr> I am AWAKE
08:35:43 <shapr> yay!
08:36:05 <bluedazzle> hehe good to know
08:36:11 <shapr> how are you?
08:36:36 <bluedazzle> I am doing good
08:37:50 <bluedazzle> I am not having much success learning haskell :(
08:38:07 <shapr> hm, what have you tried so far?
08:39:12 <bluedazzle> I havent had concrete time to sit down and read yet..have been busy getting my documents ready for my visa interview
08:39:31 <bluedazzle> hopefully after that is done I can get down to it..
08:39:32 <shapr> ah, I see
08:39:43 <shapr> yah, good idea.
09:00:26 <shapr> hej sond, vad hander?

09:58:16 <shapr> hi Arnia 
09:58:43 <Smerdyakov> Sitting at a bar in Guadalahara?
11:02:30 <cm> is it possible to "derive" from an existant type, and like, add some conditions in its content? something like newtype and explicit fromBla and toBla functions, but implicitely.
11:02:42 <cm> for instance, define a type which can contain all numbers between 0 and 100
11:02:48 <Smerdyakov> I don't think so.
11:03:04 <Smerdyakov> You want the compiler to insert your coercions at "appropriate places" automatically?
11:03:21 <cm> yeah
11:03:48 <cm> like, in c++ i could have my range<0,100> class, and provide a constructor for it which takes an integer (as an example).
11:04:10 <cm> in haskell i could add my range newtype/data, and have fromRangedInt and toRangedInt, i suppose
11:04:41 <Smerdyakov> Well, if you use a special constructor in C++, it's not automatic. Equivalent to using a special function in Haskell.
11:04:55 <cm> yes it is automatic :)
11:05:02 <cm> the constructor gets called automatically.
11:05:09 <Smerdyakov> Oh yeah. C++ bullshit funtime party.
11:05:10 <cm> (as long as not declared "explicit")
11:05:23 <Smerdyakov> I think you can do this for the special case of numbers using typeclasses in Haskell.
11:05:41 <Smerdyakov> There is already special conversion of numeric constants to appropriate numeric types, determined by context.
11:05:56 <Smerdyakov> Look into the Num type class, I think.
11:06:00 <cm> [like if you have a function void foo(Range<0,100> r), you could call foo(1337), which would call foo(Range<0,100>(1337));]
11:06:13 <Smerdyakov> Yeah, that will work in Haskell too! Though it's a very special case.
11:06:21 <cm> let me see :)
11:07:08 <cm> hmm.
11:10:07 <esap> Hmm.. could you consider the referential transparency-induced 'conversion' from reference (or location) to value as implicit conversion in Haskell?
11:10:43 <Lor> Huh?
11:11:10 <cm> Smerdyakov: can you give me a pointer, or two? ;)
11:11:30 <Lor> In Haskell, there are no locations besides STRefs and IORefs and the like.
11:11:38 <Lor> And those aren't implicitly converted to anything.
11:11:53 <Smerdyakov> cm, I think you need to define your type as an instance of Num. The fromInteger value is the key.
11:11:58 <esap> lor: no, I don't mean those. I mean boxing and unboxing.
11:12:08 <Lor> That's an implementation detail.
11:12:16 <esap> lor: implicit conversions are.
11:12:35 <Lor> When it's made part of the language (eg. ghc's unboxed types), you again have to make the conversions explicitly.
11:14:10 <esap> The point is, implicit conversions can be used to enforce equivalence classes. And referential transparency basically is just a fixed equivalence class that is used.
11:14:46 <Lor> Um.
11:14:55 <Lor> That's a really strange way of expressing it.
11:15:25 * esap has C++ background :-)
11:15:56 <Lor> Referential transparency is a feature of the semantics of the language. I don't think that's what you're really talking about.
11:17:19 <Lor> And unboxing is just something that's done under the hood, maybe. So it's not part of the language.
11:17:21 <esap> lor: well it's not just any feature. It says that there is no distinction between a name that evaluates to some value and that value. It's an equivalence class.
11:19:04 <esap> s/name/expression/
11:20:15 <Smerdyakov> esap, here's the central problem. You asked this:
11:20:15 <Smerdyakov> <esap> Hmm.. could you consider the referential transparency-induced 'conversion' from reference (or location) to value as implicit conversion in Haskell?
11:20:29 <Smerdyakov> But you didn't define what it means to "consider something as something."
11:20:37 <Smerdyakov> So define that and we can have a rational discussion of this.
11:21:28 <esap> oh I mean that is it possible to understand the semantics of referential transparency in terms of implicit conversions.
11:21:52 <Lor> Um. Would you count reduction as an "implicit conversion"?
11:22:11 <Smerdyakov> That's just as bad. You're still talking about human thought/understanding as if it's understood well enough to make statements like that.
11:22:33 <Smerdyakov> You can understand Haskell in terms of rubber chickens falling out of airplanes if that's personally meaningful and helpful to you.
11:22:41 <Smerdyakov> But we can't really discuss whether or not that is valid.
11:22:43 <cm> can i parametrize types by values (for instance, integrals)?
11:22:50 <Lor> cm, sorry, no.
11:22:54 <Smerdyakov> cm, not without encoding values as types.
11:22:54 <Lor> You want dependent types for that.
11:23:29 <cm> how would that work? like i want to have this type RangedInteger (is this a bad name, btw? not a native english speaker), with low and high bounds.
11:23:54 <esap> lor: Actually, yes, reduction could be considered as an implicit conversion.
11:23:55 <Smerdyakov> Well, it's easy to encode integers with types.
11:24:13 <Smerdyakov> type IntType = Zero | Succ IntType | Pred IntType
11:24:24 <Smerdyakov> Wait
11:24:27 <Smerdyakov> That didn't make any sense.
11:24:29 <Smerdyakov> Haha
11:24:44 <Smerdyakov> OK, it's actually kind of tricky.
11:24:54 * cm hits Smerdyakov with a large lambda :)
11:25:32 <esap> natural numbers are much easier to express as algebraic data types than integers.
11:25:41 <Smerdyakov> You can have type Zero and type Succ a
11:25:53 <Smerdyakov> And represent naturals as Zero, Succ Zero, Succ (Succ Zero), etc.
11:26:16 <Lor> You need fundeps to do computation with types.
11:27:25 * cm thinks
11:33:16 <cm> Smerdyakov: the Num thingy works, btw, thanks :)
11:47:34 <Lor> What's a good way of writing visible draft comments in latex?
11:47:56 <Smerdyakov> Lor, just make a command for it. Display it however you like.
11:48:08 <Lor> All right, there's no standard way?
11:48:51 <Smerdyakov> I've only seen people use their own commands, to date.
11:49:07 <Lor> Righto, then.
11:50:25 <Lor> Hum. I guess I have to learn to write environments, then.
11:50:52 <Smerdyakov> Or just \newcommand{draftcomment}[1]{CRAZY COMMENT #1 END CRAZY COMMENT}
11:51:11 <Smerdyakov> With a \ before draftcomment :)
11:51:45 <Lor> Yeah, but then I'd have to write all the stuff inside \draftcomment{.....}, right?
11:52:10 <Lor> Would it work if I put itemize-lists inside it?
11:52:39 <Lor> (No, I am not particularly fond of the syntax or semantics of latex, no.)
11:52:49 <mattam> it can
11:53:08 <Lor> How deep magic is required to write an environment?
11:53:17 <mattam> latex is a so poor language with so nice results it always seemed magic to me :)
11:53:58 <mattam> \newenvironment{envname}[#args]{%begincode}{%endcode}
11:54:45 <Lor> Yep, right, just found out myself.
11:55:08 <Lor> Is an environment really just syntactic sugar for a header and a footer around a piece of text?
11:56:33 <mattam> yes
11:57:01 <mattam> so spaces in definitions are meaningful
11:57:04 <Lor> Zany. How can a kludge like this have survived for so long?
11:57:14 <Lor> Latex is older than perl, isn't it?
11:57:19 <mattam> => good results
11:57:30 <Lor> Yeah...
11:57:44 <Lor> Maybe I should write a preprocessor in scheme that generates latex...
11:57:57 <mattam> he
11:58:08 <Cale2> TeX has virtually no bugs in it.
11:58:22 <Riastradh> Lor, look for JAR's 'markup' thing.
11:58:27 <mattam> that's a good point too
11:58:36 <Lor> All right, is there some way to save the current "writing mode" and then restore it when exiting the environment?
11:59:00 <Lor> If I just put \em at the beginning, how would I know what style to revert to at the end...
12:00:34 <Lor> Or is there a way to say that the environment header should be "{\em" and the footer should be "}" ?
12:01:10 <Smerdyakov> I think just \em for the header would work..
12:01:26 <Smerdyakov> As long as no one uses a contradictory directive inside.
12:19:57 <shapr> hi sild 
12:26:30 <sild> hey
12:27:06 <sild> dont suppose you know any good links for type inference (cant find much on google :()
12:27:09 <sild> ?
12:28:18 <cm> that one peyton jones paper..
12:28:55 <cm> or no, that was for higher-rank types
12:30:47 <Lor> I'm just reading it. :)
12:30:49 <Lor> Nice timing.
12:31:51 <cm> :)
12:36:19 <Lor> The SPJ/Shields paper does offer a nice introduction to the issues with type inference, even though the actual point is in adapting it to higher ranks.
12:36:59 <sild> what is the title of the paper?
12:37:17 <Lor> I think it was originally "Putting type annotations to work".
12:37:35 <Lor> Currently it's "Practical type-inference for arbitrary-rank types"
12:37:49 <sild> ok, thanks
12:37:56 <Lor> http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/putting/
12:38:17 <Lor> It hasn't been published yet, so it's prone to changes...
12:57:39 <Marvin--> "brg"?
13:59:10 <Lor> Ouch. Felleisen on Milner: "Robin went wrong when he said typed programs can't go wrong (I told him so) and he's wrong again."
14:10:19 <cm> hmm.
14:10:46 <cm> where is that?
14:21:42 <Lor> ll1-discuss
14:22:03 <Lor> (stfw if necessary)

14:42:12 <Saki> shapr: i am setting up a wiki
14:42:16 <ibid> thanks
14:42:16 <Saki> which version should i use ?
14:42:33 <shapr> I would suggest http://moin.sf.net/
14:42:40 <Saki> okay
14:42:42 <Saki> thank you
14:42:48 <blackdog> hah... for a second there, I was about to google for "giyf"
14:42:49 <Saki> setting up linux.com.lb
14:42:54 <shapr> cool
14:42:56 <shapr> g'day blackdog 
14:43:01 <Saki> any wiki written in haskell server pages ?
14:43:15 <shapr> not that I've heard of
14:43:17 <blackdog> hey shapr.
14:43:18 <shapr> I only know of wiwiwi,
14:43:24 <shapr> but it doesn't use HSP
14:43:28 <Saki> okay
14:44:23 <Lor> moinmoin is kindasorta neat, but not quite enough.
14:44:32 <shapr> what else does it need?
14:44:43 <Lor> No support for revision control, and it doesn't have a real internal index, so it's not scalable.
14:44:55 <Lor> the code is readable, though, which is a plus.
14:45:00 <shapr> hm, I thought it did support RC
14:45:13 <Lor> It stores the previous version, but no more, afaics.
14:45:41 <shapr> I was a non-developer on the MoinMoin project for awhile.
14:46:23 <Smerdyakov> I've always been a MoinMoin non-developer!
14:46:35 <Saki> Lor: what  do you suggest ?
14:46:56 <Lor> depends on what you want.
14:47:02 <Lor> I think I will eventually write one of my own.
14:47:14 <Lor> jspwiki has a nice architecture, and it's actively maintained.
14:47:20 <Lor> It's rather heavy, though.
14:47:57 <Lor> Currently I'm using jspwiki for my personal use. Hopefully only temporarily, though.
14:49:48 <Lor> Hum, now that I think of it, wikipedia's engine might be nice.
14:49:59 <Lor> MediaWiki, it's apparently called.

20:59:53 <SyntaxLaptop> blackdog: ss?
21:00:27 <blackdog> System Support. Tech support for the CS department at our uni.
21:00:31 <ozone> blackdog: good work.  working hard?
21:00:51 <ozone> are you rewriting NeilOS in a purely functional manner?
21:01:13 <blackdog> ozone: i'm reminded of my old school song, but here's probably not the right place... Yes, I am. Currently desperately trying to avoid writing a mini type-inferrer.
21:01:32 <SyntaxLaptop> heh
21:01:42 <SyntaxLaptop> blackdog: can you get paid for writing one? ;)
21:02:05 <blackdog> SyntaxLaptop: nope. this is all strictly for love. :)
21:02:47 <Smerdyakov> System support. That's kind of icky. Did you look for a research job first?
21:02:48 <blackdog> i'm trying to steer a course between the Scylla of completeness and the Charybdis of functionality
21:02:57 <ozone> blackdog: can you scab a trip out of them to go to LCA in January? :)
21:03:15 <SyntaxLaptop> blackdog: love conquers all, or so I hear 
21:03:27 <blackdog> Well, I'm finishing a master's degree - i'd rather have a relatively brainless job until i finish that.
21:03:40 <Smerdyakov> Ye gods. A graduate student working in tech support. That's very weird.
21:03:48 * ozone was going to mutter something about masturbation, but realises that he's not on an overseas trip anymore
21:03:55 <SyntaxLaptop> blackdog: don't mind Smerdyakov. I'm sure he's very happy for you
21:04:02 <blackdog> ozone: don't knock it, it's sex with someone I love
21:04:59 <ozone> was actually something to do with isaac's "love conquers all" statement, but anyway ...
21:05:20 <SyntaxLaptop> ozone: I think everyone was trying hard not to figure out what you are talking about ;)
21:05:21 <ozone> although if love could conquer this shitty code i'm looking at right now, i'd be even more for it
21:05:56 <ozone> SyntaxLaptop: like most things i say :)
21:06:08 <blackdog> Smerdyakov: quite a few of the SS guys are grad students, actually. (Although there's certainly more OS hackers than FP mavens. :)
21:06:12 <ozone> speaking of, has anybody looked at Daan Leijen's Lazy Virtual Machine project?
21:06:33 <Smerdyakov> blackdog, maybe it's An Australian Thing. :)
21:07:31 <ozone> Smerdyakov: it's called "too lazy to look for an out-of-uni job".  no offense to blackdog, although he is one hella lazy bugger
21:08:00 <blackdog> ozone: No, not at all. It's my "incentive to actually come in to uni job".
21:08:15 <ozone> you could take that sentence two ways
21:08:21 <ozone> didn't know SS guys in uniform did that to you
21:08:39 <blackdog> leave the poor sentence alone
21:09:10 <ozone> but it's still breathing and pattable!
21:09:18 <blackdog> *shudder*
21:09:48 <blackdog> Mr Ozone: redefining the gutter
21:10:16 <ozone> i should use that quote for my future home page
21:10:18 <ozone> thanks :)
21:11:50 <Smerdyakov> Well, you know, it's rather traditional for graduate students to have research or teaching jobs.
21:12:13 <Smerdyakov> I guess not so traditional for those how don't have those as major requirements for their degrees.
21:12:41 <blackdog> That's true, but the problem is that they're seasonal (the teaching jobs, at least). Miss a month in the middle (to attend ICFP, for instance), and they become rather harder to find.
21:13:04 <Smerdyakov> But there are always research jobs. Every day of the year. :)
21:14:05 <blackdog> True. But I am a bear of very little brain, and holding two research projects in my head simultaneously just isn't going to work.
21:14:45 <Smerdyakov> So make sacrifices. Put off your personal one. Avoid dealing with hapless computer users. :)
21:15:37 <blackdog> My personal one is my master's thesis. Chilli would be less than impressed if I postponed it. :)
21:15:53 <Smerdyakov> You're supposed to get PAID to work on your thesis!
21:16:02 <blackdog> Thank god it's second level - students have to go through the helpdesk to get to SS.
21:16:04 <Smerdyakov> That's the best part about grad school!
21:16:16 <blackdog> only if you get a scholarship.
21:16:39 * blackdog regrets having _quite_ so good a time as an undergraduate
21:16:39 <Smerdyakov> Really? Professors have no money available to pay you to work on thesis research within their projects?
21:17:29 <blackdog> Probably, if I was in Chilli's SEC project. My stuff's pretty tangential.
21:17:54 <Smerdyakov> Mm. Your first mistake. You need to work in an area that someone will pay you to work in. :D
21:18:40 <blackdog> we live and learn.
21:18:59 <Smerdyakov> Are you planning on PhD next?
21:20:05 <blackdog> If I can get a scholarship for it, certainly. I've eaten enough Ramen noodles to last me a lifetime
21:20:41 <Smerdyakov> "Scholarship" in AU is "fellowship" in US?
21:21:25 <blackdog> Um... I thought a fellowship was something you got _after_ your doctorate? Once you're a working academic?
21:21:46 <Smerdyakov> Not in the US.
21:21:57 <Smerdyakov> Scholarship applies up through undergraduate land.
21:22:00 <Smerdyakov> Fellowship is everything after.
21:22:05 <ozone> blackdog: as in "fellowship of the ring"
21:22:35 <Smerdyakov> Fellowship carries an understanding that you'll produce useful research.
21:22:45 <Smerdyakov> Scholarship just means "We like you. Now goof off and maybe get a degree."
21:24:12 <blackdog> Hm, that's interesting. The big one in AU is the Australian Postgraduate Award, and I think they call it a scholarship still. It has reviews, though, and if you goof off too much, you'll lose it.
21:24:24 <blackdog> ozone: i get elves and dwarves and wizards? as in vassals? Cool.
23:49:09 <dweimers> What are the most important feautures of a functional language besides higher-order functions and rank2 polymorphism?
23:51:56 <ddarius> I don't think most functional languages provide rank-2 polymorphism
23:52:55 <dweimers> ddarius: ok forget the rank-2 part ;)
23:53:59 <ddarius> It depends on your definition of functional.  For example, Haskellers would very likely add purity, but many impure languages are also considered functional.
23:54:10 <ddarius> (though typically they still encourage purity)
23:55:24 <dweimers> ddarius: what does is mean to be pure?
23:56:51 <ddarius> Roughly, having no side-effecting operations, particularly mutable state.
23:58:13 <dweimers> ddarius: ahh ok, so higher-order polymorphic functions that are first-class, laziness, no side=effects, and no assignments sums it up?
