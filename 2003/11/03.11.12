01:21:02 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
01:21:54 <shapr> what's going on?
01:28:36 <shapr> Lor: hey, is the code for your XML thingy available?
01:29:41 <Lor> It's in some horribly messy old files. I really ought to clean it up first. Or at least see if it still works.
01:30:11 <shapr> ok
01:30:12 <Lor> Pester me in a week or so, I have to get my compressor ready first.
01:30:17 <shapr> sure, will do
01:39:15 <shapr> wow, there are several neat new projects in the Haskell world
01:39:18 <shapr> the HC&A is out today
01:44:01 <shapr> hm, I bet #haskell counts a user group
01:47:40 * earthy nods
01:48:07 <shapr> the HC&A is great fun to read
01:48:30 <Lunar^> shapr: I discovered part of the Graal last night :)
01:50:41 <shapr> the Graal?
01:50:49 <Lunar^> shapr: After reading the paper about Esther published on LtU, I digged about Famke, that is _exactly_ my domain of interests
01:50:59 * shapr looks
01:51:27 <Lunar^> shapr: "Towards a Strongly Typed Functional Operating System"
01:51:53 <shapr> w00!
01:52:02 <Lor> IMHO, an operating system shouldn't be functional.
01:52:12 <Lunar^> They use Clean because they need Dynamic type matching
01:52:25 <Lunar^> Which is a missing feature of Haskell current support of dynamic, I think
01:52:37 <mattam> Lunar^: url ?
01:52:44 <Lunar^> mattam: http://www.cs.kun.nl/~arjenw/
01:56:11 <Lunar^> shapr: You understand what I mean by "part of the Graal" better now ?
01:56:56 * musasabi still has problems fitting reactive programs to functional solutions
01:57:01 <ozone> Lunar^: i saw a demo of Esther at IFL, it's pretty impressive
01:57:16 <ozone> and i'm glad the clean guys did it, since hopefully it'll motivate somebody in the haskell community to do the same for haskell
01:57:24 <ozone> (if only i were doing a ph.d now :)
01:57:39 <Lunar^> Should we really duplicate efforts ?
01:58:14 <mattam> wow, Clean seems realy cool :p)
01:58:16 <ozone> why not?  the clean guys like doing their own thing, and in the long run it ends up being better
01:58:35 <Lunar^> What is missing with Famke and Esther at the moment is proof that FP could also be used for the low-level part
01:58:46 <ozone> things like uniqueness types vs monads for handling imperative/state programming, for instance
01:58:50 <earthy> the clean people have been at that Functional OS stuff for years already, by the way
01:59:22 <Lunar^> That would be more interesing to research on this part, IMHO, and I have some ideas about using arrows to do it
01:59:54 <Lunar^> I don't know if Arrow is a concept that could work in Clean though
02:02:16 <musasabi> and functions would have to be made non-opaque in haskell...
02:02:32 <earthy> and arjen is *not* doing it right. :) He ought to look at Jonathan Rees' PhD dissertation.
02:02:42 <Lunar^> musasabi: mhh?
02:02:45 <ozone> earthy: big claim.  why?
02:02:50 <Lunar^> earthy: Why ?
02:03:15 <earthy> simple. He's trying to build a classical OS. this does not match well with the language he's using to build it in.
02:04:30 <earthy> Jonathan Rees, in his PhD thesis, explains a very clear and simple model for an OS kernel
02:04:36 <musasabi> Lunar^: one needs to serialize code - and this is not possible for haskell functions (afaik)
02:04:42 <earthy> that jives *extremely* well with functional programming.
02:04:57 <earthy> musasabi: not *yet* you mean.
02:05:07 <Lunar^> musasabi: Right, but that could be worked out IMHO
02:05:39 <Lunar^> earthy: Do you think it's so classical to have a type safe object repository and mobile code ?
02:06:33 <musasabi> as there is no object identity I fail to see a simple way of implementing it.
02:06:52 <musasabi> (c.l.f had a discussion on this quite recently)
02:06:53 <earthy> lunar^: the typesafeness is not classical, true. ;)
02:07:11 <Lunar^> musasabi: Could you explain a bit more ?
02:08:10 <musasabi> Lunar^: well how do we decide whether functions a and b are equal?
02:08:44 <Lunar^> earthy: *nix is everything is file, every file belongs to a parent directory and every data can be see as text. Famke seems to make great progress from this
02:08:58 <earthy> `seems'
02:09:24 <Lunar^> musasabi: Why do you need that ?
02:09:53 <Lunar^> earthy: I didn't not dig enough to eventually remove that word ;)
02:10:16 <earthy> thing is, he uses the same security model that unix and windows use
02:10:23 <musasabi> Lunar^: e.g. to avoid cycles
02:10:46 <earthy> and he has adhockery for naming
02:10:53 <Lunar^> musasabi: ok.. I see now
02:11:33 <Lunar^> earthy: I'm not thinking in term of security that much now
02:11:55 <Lunar^> earthy: I'm still too young and anarchist ;)
02:12:07 <earthy> lunar^: have you read Jonathan Rees' PhD thesis? :)
02:12:23 <Lunar^> earthy: It's on my papers stack now
02:12:27 <earthy> (go and do... it'll open your eyes as to how a functional OS kernel can look ;))
02:13:00 <earthy> (and, well, cooperative multithreading is *soo* '60's... :))
02:13:01 <Lunar^> earthy: Thanks for pointing it
02:14:27 <Lunar^> Panther's preview still has problem to display LaTeX generated Postscript well.. :(
02:14:37 <earthy> err... not so. ;)
02:14:51 <earthy> how do you generate the PostScript? :)
02:15:07 <Lunar^> earthy: It's not mine in this case, it's Rees'
02:15:11 <earthy> ah, right. ;)
02:15:39 <earthy> yeah, there's a little tiny problem there in that there is only *1* resolution of a rendered font in it
02:16:01 <earthy> (the PS is bitrendered for I think 600dpi)
02:16:08 <earthy> (well, the fonts in it)
02:16:17 <Lunar^> Ok. That's why it's so slooooow
02:16:23 * earthy nods
02:16:41 <Lunar^> $ apt-get install gv will do the trick. Thanks to XDarwin and Fink :)
02:16:52 <ozone> geez, more haskell os x users than i thought
02:16:56 <earthy> gv doesn't do a much better job of showing it though.
02:18:33 <Lunar^> earthy: Why that ?
02:29:24 <earthy> lunar^: it also has to render the 600dpi pixelated font down to screen resolution
02:30:18 <earthy> and it doesn't do any better at that than Preview, in my experience (but that's comparing a PS2PDF'd postscript in jagwire's preview with gv on the original ps)
02:30:38 <Lunar^> earthy: I'm talking about using gv to view straight .ps
02:31:05 <Lunar^> earthy: What Panther's Preview does is using PS2PDF internally to allow one to view PS files
02:31:27 <earthy> yes...
02:31:47 <earthy> that's what I'm saying... I can't really distinguish the output
02:43:47 <Lunar^> earthy: Ok.. I see what you were talking about for concurrency handling
02:44:43 <shapr> I wonder if everything is an algorithmic datatype would be better
02:44:46 <Lunar^> earthy: I think Arjen took this path because it didn't touch the Clean RTS or low-level code. It's really simplier that way
02:44:56 <shapr> wouldn't that be like parameterizing the "everything is an X" structure?
02:46:52 <musasabi> btw does anyone know a good introduction on fitting pure functional programming and concurrency?
02:47:16 <Lunar^> musasabi: I read interesting things in Alice presentation
02:47:33 <Lor> Uh, when you do _pure_ functional programming, "concurrency" is not a concept.
02:47:47 <Lunar^> musasabi: The notion of "future computation" which could be seems as lazy but parallel computations
02:47:50 <Lor> Parallelism is, but even that is merely an implementation issue.
02:50:01 <musasabi> Lor: of course it is not on the pure parts but when we mix monads to get sequencing then it starts to exist.
02:51:18 <Lor> Once you have some way of representing stateful computations, the concurrency issues are the same as everywhere. I don't see it mattering too much whether you represent the statefulness with side effects or monads.
02:53:05 <Lunar^> Lor: Monads (or Arrows) isolate state, this makes an important difference I think
02:53:39 <Lor> Well yes, sorry. I interpreted "Monads" as referring to IO, ie. to a global state.
02:54:28 <Lunar^> shapr: I know what tutorial we need !
02:56:36 <musasabi> with functional programming f a should return the same result everytime a is the same. Now if we have f a  = takeValueFromSharedVariable a, and an another concurrent thread modifying a
02:57:10 <musasabi> no
02:57:18 * musasabi sees his error
02:57:26 <shapr> Lunar^: what?
02:57:50 <Lunar^> shapr: Something about how to use Arrows to carry multiple state
02:58:14 <shapr> I was hoping for something I can actually write :-)
02:59:17 <Lunar^> shapr: hehe... :) It's an awful feeling to "feel" power without understanding how to use it :(
02:59:34 <shapr> yah, I agree.
03:32:00 <shapr> hi Darius 
03:32:01 <shapr> what's up?
03:37:55 <Darius> not much
03:43:16 <shapr> have you seen the new HC&A ?
03:44:21 <shapr> hej andersca_
03:45:25 <andersca_> hej
03:46:38 <Darius> shapr: no
03:48:07 <Darius> shapr: Why didn't you invent some title for yourself? :P
03:48:32 <shapr> you mean something like Grand Poobah of the Haskell Channel?
03:49:05 <Darius> Actually, it's more 'place of work'
03:49:05 <shapr> head irritant ;-)
03:49:11 <shapr> huh?
03:50:20 <shapr> hm
03:50:25 <Darius> For the HC&AR there's Iavor Diatchki, OGI School of Science and Engineering, OHSU, USA / Shae Erisson, Sweden / Levent Erkok, OGI School of Science and Engineering, OHSU, USA
03:50:30 <shapr> yah, I see your point.
03:51:06 <shapr> I should have said Unseen University
03:51:58 <Darius> They aren't all universities, e.g. AMD.
03:52:21 <Darius> Jens Peterson is in Japan?
03:52:24 <shapr> yup
03:52:47 <shapr> okasaki, tokyo, and back to okasaki I think
03:57:15 <shapr> vital looks spiffy
03:57:25 <shapr> I wish it didn't use Java
03:58:40 <shapr> cute --> http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/vital/illustrations/styles.html
04:00:13 <shapr> new Haddock
04:00:30 <shapr> I wonder if 0.6 is more amenable to botification.
04:04:42 <earthy> vital is definitely cute.
04:56:37 <shapr> @yow
04:56:39 <lambdabot> Just imagine you're entering a state-of-the-art CAR WASH!!
05:00:47 <earthy> @arr
05:00:48 <lambdabot> Aye
05:06:32 <shapr> I finally created a slashdot user account, I've sold out.
05:06:48 <shapr> @arr
05:06:48 <lambdabot> Smartly me lass
05:07:04 <earthy> why is that a sellout?
05:07:25 <shapr> I've given in to big business, pop culture, and mainstream pap.
05:08:27 <earthy> /. is mainstream, yea, but not *that* mainstream
05:08:41 <shapr> I dunno
05:08:56 <shapr> I'm more of a memepool, boingboing, sweetcode kind of guy
05:11:27 * shapr is entertained -> http://itg.stud.hint.no/~oysteinl/tan_lines.html
05:13:24 <Lunar^> shapr: memepool ?
05:15:21 <shapr> http://www.memepool.com/
05:15:25 <shapr> years of weird
05:18:06 <shapr> hi harsha123 
05:18:08 <shapr> hoi blitznl 
05:18:11 <shapr> wazzup?
05:18:14 <harsha123> shapr hello :)
05:18:31 <blitznl> hoi shapr, nothing just cruisin'
05:18:35 <harsha123> nothing much.. looking into some iptables libs
05:19:00 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice hi
05:19:23 <shapr> have you guys seen the Haskell Communities and Activities report?
05:19:35 <harsha123> hmm..any link?
05:20:08 <Lunar^> shapr: where?
05:20:26 <harsha123> to the report! 
05:20:51 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/communities/
05:20:56 <blitznl> shapr: not yet but it was released this morning 
05:21:12 --- topic: set to '["We put the Funk in Funktion","See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/","Learning Haskell - http://www.haskell.org/learning.html","lots of cool debs in the haskell-experimental archive - see http://www.syntaxpolice.org/haskell-experimental/haskell-experimental.html","new HC&A Report - http://www.haskell.org/communities/","Any user who would like to request any unwritten tutorial please msg shapr", "peakUsers = 72"]' by shapr
05:21:34 <Lunar^> shapr: This is interesting
05:21:44 <Lunar^> shapr: But is there any place for geeks like us ?
05:23:18 <shapr> what do you mean specifically?
05:23:26 <shapr> something other than lambda.weblogs.com ?
05:23:45 <Lunar^> shapr: No, I'm talking about this report
05:24:13 <shapr> oh
05:24:18 <Lunar^> shapr: It seems to focus about what research group are up to, isn't it ?
05:24:22 <shapr> yes, mostly
05:24:29 <shapr> haskell-libs is mentioned in there, I got that in yesterday
05:24:43 <shapr> I haven't written anything about the #haskell channel in there though
05:24:54 <Lunar^> Could the lambdabot, PDFLib or hOp be in the next release ?
05:24:58 <shapr> sure
05:25:08 <shapr> lambdabot and PDFLib *are* mentioned in the report :-)
05:25:12 <Lunar^> ?
05:25:31 <shapr> I gave a short list of projects in haskell-libs
05:25:44 <shapr> I think hlibs needs an index page as well.
05:26:04 <Lunar^> Uh yeah....
05:26:07 <Lunar^> sweet :)
05:26:21 <Lunar^> I need to update the PDFLib binding to the last revision btw
05:26:45 <Lunar^> It seems to work quite well finally (it stills miss some features though)
05:26:57 <shapr> if it's works, it's good
05:27:07 <shapr> er s/it's/it
05:27:37 <Lunar^> It works for what I need : generate a simple page from a CGI
05:27:59 <Lunar^> I would love to make a DocBook renderer
05:30:29 <shapr> what's the license on pdflib itself?
05:30:32 * shapr looks
05:31:43 <shapr> oh, it's nice
05:32:00 <Lunar^> not quite good
05:32:05 <shapr> but not bad either
05:32:13 <Lunar^> But as long as you do open source it's good
05:32:48 <Lunar^> I would be glad to have a better web front-end for darcs
05:33:43 <shapr> yes, that's true
05:37:12 <andersca_> hej ski
05:37:28 <ski> hej andersca
05:37:57 <shapr> Lunar^: what sort of better front end would you like to see?
05:38:37 <Lunar^> shapr: Being able to view more quickly differences between two patches
05:38:55 <Lunar^> shapr: uhh.. i'm not clear
05:39:13 * Lunar^ hits himself : « Damn perverted CVS user »
05:39:18 * shapr grins
05:41:41 <ozone> shapr: hey, have you checked out Meta-CVS at all?
05:41:52 <ozone> you seem to be the sort of person who would have checked out stuff like that :)
05:42:16 <shapr> nah, haven't tried meta-cvs
05:42:23 <shapr> is it cool?
05:42:48 <ozone> http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/mcvs.html
05:43:13 <ozone> it's nice because you can use standard CVS servers with it
05:44:16 <shapr> sounds interesting
05:44:30 <Lunar^> ozone: It stills has the bottleneck of CVS
05:45:02 <ozone> like?
05:45:09 <ozone> (not defending it, just asking)
05:46:10 <Lunar^> ozone: renaming, file based, directory management
05:46:55 <ozone> did you read the webpage? :)
05:46:56 <shapr> ozone: do you have commit privs to the hlibs darcs repo?
05:47:06 <ozone> it handles renaming, and most likely does directory management too
05:47:13 <ozone> shapr: nope
05:47:22 <shapr> want to try it?
05:47:33 <Lunar^> ozone: dunno... I looked at it quite a while ago and found some problems
05:47:36 <ozone> hehe, don't have much time to spend on haskell these days, but sure, why not
05:47:41 <ozone> my sourceforge id is athp
05:47:45 <ozone> Lunar^: oh, right
05:47:48 <ozone> hey, sup igloo
05:47:50 <shapr> hi Igloo 
05:48:03 <shapr> ozone: in this case, you need to give me your GPG key fingerprint
05:48:06 <Lunar^> ozone: What I really enjoy with darcs is change granularity
05:48:09 <shapr> then I can add you to the repo
05:48:29 <Lunar^> ozone: It's at set of line level
05:49:30 <ozone> shapr: oh.  errr, that means i have to make one
05:49:38 <shapr> yup
05:49:46 <shapr> darcs is worth trying imho
05:49:48 <ozone> shapr: that means that i'll bother about that another time :)
05:50:12 <shapr> aw c'mon, it's not so hard :-)
05:50:19 * shapr reads the directions
05:50:53 <shapr> gpg --gen-key
05:52:36 <ozone> shapr: that implies that i have to install gpg :)
05:52:56 <shapr> that's true.
05:53:11 <ozone> hehe, sorry
05:53:19 <ozone> i'll have to install it when i'm at work and bored out of my mind reading slashdot
05:54:32 <shapr> ok
06:35:00 <shapr> I'm bored, I think I'll install 2.6.0
06:36:38 <SyntaxPolice> heyhey
06:37:17 <shapr> hiya
06:45:31 <phubuh> oink
06:45:38 <shapr> boing!
06:45:41 <shapr> hiya phubuh 
06:45:44 <shapr> wazzup?
06:45:47 <phubuh> hey shapr!
06:45:50 <phubuh> not much.
07:07:51 <andersca_> is there a way to convert a value to hex?
07:08:58 <shapr> might be showHex in NumericExts
07:09:32 <phubuh> showHex is in Numeric
07:09:57 <andersca_> i wrote one myself
07:10:03 <andersca_> I knew that the value wouldn't exceed 255
07:46:43 <Lunar^> shapr: Is there an equivalent to fst in Python ?
07:47:39 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, what does it do?
07:47:48 <Lunar^> @type fst
07:47:48 <lambdabot> fst :: (a,b) -> a
07:48:06 <Lunar^> self-explained
07:48:32 <phubuh> [0]?
07:48:38 <Lunar^> On a tupple ?!
07:48:42 <Darius> That worked for me.
07:48:57 <Lunar^> ok
07:49:13 <Lunar^> But then i can write something as (map fst) :(
07:49:19 <Lunar^> can't
07:49:28 <Smerdyakov> Can.
07:49:39 <Lunar^> I need to use a lambda
07:49:45 <Smerdyakov> Wrong.
07:49:49 <Darius> You could just define fst.
07:49:52 <phubuh> def fst (x): x[0] :-)
07:50:01 <Smerdyakov> fst is defined for me by default in hugs!
07:50:09 <Lunar^> I'm talking about Python !
07:50:14 <shapr> right, python
07:50:18 <Smerdyakov> Oh. I mis-parsed your sentence.
07:50:26 <Smerdyakov> Why use Python? :)
07:50:32 <Lunar^> phubuh: Ok, I will use a lambda then
07:50:35 <shapr> tuples in Python are immutable lists.
07:50:40 <shapr> lists are mutable in-place in Python.
07:51:04 <andersca> strings aren't
07:51:17 <shapr> right
08:20:34 <shapr> yeehaa
09:13:16 <shapr> wheeee
09:13:32 <shapr> hello anduril1 
09:13:47 <shrimpx> heh
09:13:52 <anduril1> hey shapr
09:14:01 <shapr> how's code?
09:14:06 <shapr> hello mr shrimp
09:14:14 <shrimpx> hi
09:14:20 <shapr> how's code treating you?
09:14:50 <shrimpx> ok-ish
09:16:11 <isomer> hi ho
09:16:33 <shapr> heya anth
09:16:36 <shapr> wazzup?
09:17:04 <isomer> not much, shapr...just procrastinating a bit before i do some work. how about you?
09:17:23 <shapr> I've spent my day doing that :-)
09:17:37 <isomer> indeed :)
09:17:48 <isomer> it's only noon here, so i've only wasted the morning
09:18:28 <isomer> i've got to finish a paper today, when what i really want to be doing is building a compiler :(
09:19:35 <shapr> I'd rather be writing Haskell, but I'm sposed to be fixing a website
09:20:31 <isomer> ugh
09:22:54 <harsha123> isomer: you at school?
09:23:59 <isomer> back at school, to be precise
09:24:29 <isomer> have a computer science degree, worked for many years, now studying biochemistry...then med school (with any luck)
09:24:30 <harsha123> ok..
09:24:52 <harsha123> biochemistry???
09:25:10 <isomer> yeah, i program molecules now :)
09:25:28 <harsha123> omg, isnt that a killer combination? computer sc. and medical school :)
09:25:41 <isomer> well, i'm kind of hoping so!
09:25:55 <harsha123> are you in the US ?
09:26:12 <isomer> canada - though i've applied to med school in both countries
09:26:23 <harsha123> hmm..ok
09:26:29 <isomer> you?
09:26:54 <harsha123> me in india, work for *very* small linux firm
09:27:01 <harsha123> :)
09:27:37 <isomer> neat - i've never managed to find a linux job. is it fun?
09:28:04 <harsha123> yes, kinda fun.. cause i get to learn what i want.. 
09:28:20 <harsha123> i also plan to study further so..  just planning things
09:28:35 <isomer> computer science?
09:29:20 <harsha123> hmm i have a bachelors degree in comp. sc. and plan to continue in comp. sc.
09:30:42 <harsha123> isomer which univ ?
09:30:57 <harsha123> isomer which univ are you at?
09:31:27 <isomer> i'm at university of ottawa right now
09:31:33 <harsha123> ok...
09:31:38 <isomer> (a surprisingly good school)
09:32:38 <harsha123> hmm .. surprisingly? 
09:35:07 <isomer> i'm surprised at how good the professors are - a disproportionately high number are (a) great lecturers and (b) in touch with their students (c) people who care about their teaching as much as about their research
09:37:13 <harsha123> you are lucky! i've had a bad experience during my undergraduate studies....if just the opposite of what you said.. thats the sole reason i wanna do my graduate studies from a good univ.
09:43:48 <harsha123> shapr what about your plans for a window manager in haskell?
12:36:42 <TripleDES> hi
12:38:14 <ski> hi TripleDES
12:39:34 <ski> do you have any particular question ?  (e.g. about haskell, etc ...)
12:39:57 <TripleDES> hehe...nothing special
12:40:16 <TripleDES> I just arrive at home...at have launched my IRC client
12:40:19 <TripleDES> :=)
12:40:21 <ski> do you know any haskell ?  learning ?

12:41:58 <TripleDES> DeMontfort @ UK
12:42:09 <ski> mhm
12:43:04 <ski> so what do you think of haskell ?  :)
12:43:31 <TripleDES> It's so interesting and FUN
12:44:15 <ski> have you programmed before ?  (C,Pascal,Basic,Java, etc ..)
12:44:21 <ski> yes
12:44:27 <TripleDES> some C and Java
12:44:32 <ski> ok
12:45:08 * ski too
12:45:18 * TripleDES time to take a shower
14:32:45 <shapr> hi dark
14:33:39 <shapr> will the excitement never cease?
14:35:08 <dark> excitement of what?
14:35:40 <shapr> of a quiet channel ;-)
14:35:44 <tic> weh
14:35:52 <shapr> hej tic 
14:35:56 <dark> It's quiet because we're all coding!
14:36:04 <tic> we're all studying quantum physics!
14:36:10 <shapr> dark: oh, good reason!
14:36:15 <shapr> I just watched Tron
14:36:28 <SyntaxPolice> Tron rulz!
14:36:28 <dark> I'm using perverted layout tricks again.
14:36:32 <shapr> yah, Tron is great
14:36:59 <dark> if p
14:37:00 <dark>   then foo
14:37:01 <dark>   else do
14:37:02 <dark> ...
14:37:23 <ibid> i'd rather not mention here what i'm about to do :)
14:37:34 <shapr> ibid: oh great
14:37:37 <shapr> now I have to wonder
14:37:44 <dark> Imagination can be a terrible thing.
14:38:08 <ibid> it's both on and off topic
14:38:22 <dark> ibid: Yes! No! Yes! No!
14:38:31 <shapr> I can't decide!
14:41:23 <ibid> i just got a copy of the c standard (the book, i mean). surely i have to read it :)
14:42:08 <dark> ibid: C89 or C99?
14:42:33 <ibid> C99 with TC1 incorporated
14:43:57 <ibid> i have the C++std book in mail
14:44:08 <ibid> (or it will be in mail soon...)
14:44:34 <dark> ibid: C++ has a standard?  Wow.
14:45:02 <ibid> dark: since 1998
14:45:15 <ibid> you didn't know?
14:47:53 <dark> ibid: I've managed to avoid learning C++ so far :)
14:48:09 <ibid> :)
14:48:09 <dark> ibid: I've had to wrestle with various C++ programs to get them to compile with various compilers.
14:48:22 <ibid> C++ has its moments
14:48:33 <dark> ibid: Especially the whole "template instantation" process seemed fairly mysterious and arbitrary.
14:48:44 <ibid> dark: oh?
14:49:14 * SyntaxPolice started thinking about a reply to dark's comment, then realized he was having a "C++ Moment", then stopped
14:49:21 <dark> ibid: At some point g++ got picky about instantiating the same template under different typedefs.  This gets awkward if the typedefs themselves are platform-dependent.
14:49:22 <ibid> (of course, C++ implementations have been a moving target. they are only now getting sufficiently close to the standard to stop moving)
14:49:41 <ibid> dark: don't understand?
14:49:46 <ibid> (i don't, that is)
14:50:02 <dark> ibid: Well this was in the sgmtools code.
14:51:02 <dark> ibid: They had some sort of Vector template, and a file that listed for which types it should exist.
14:51:17 <dark> ibid: In the list were for example Char, Int8, and Int16.  I forgot what names they really used.
14:51:33 <dark> ibid: The problem was that on some platforms, Char was Int8, and on others it was Int16, depending on some unicode setting.
14:52:45 <ibid> a file that listed instantiations? sounds rather legacy :)
14:52:51 <dark> ibid: apparently their compiler allowed identical instances (identical after resolving typedefs), and my version of g++ didn't.
14:53:19 <dark> ibid: Well there was a whole chapter about such files, and the new way to do it, which was somewhat uncertainly supported by g++ :)
14:53:41 <dark> ibid: I decided to back away from trying to change that, considering that I don't know any C++.
14:54:00 <ibid> dark: as i said, C++ implementations have been a moving target
14:54:03 <dark> s/chapter/chapter in the g++ info docs/
14:55:10 <dark> ibid: I guess sgmltools was also fairly crufty :)
14:56:23 * shapr bounces cheerfully
14:56:34 <shapr> I wish irate had a minimum playlevel setting
14:56:49 <dark> irate?
14:58:29 <shapr> irate.sf.net 
14:58:44 <shapr> best way to get free and legal new music
14:59:21 <shapr> I've gotten 3.3G of legal mp3s with it
14:59:57 <isomer> any known bands who've opted out of the riaa?
15:00:29 <shapr> er, huh?
15:00:46 <isomer> ...and gone to releasing free legal mp3s
15:03:26 <dark> isomer: Depends on what you mean with "known" :)
15:04:58 <isomer> i suppose i should just look rather than ask...
15:37:26 <shapr> jiihaa
15:37:55 <ski> d ? 
15:55:27 <shapr> huh cool
15:55:37 <shapr> I met a cool guy in Seattle, Jon Singer
15:55:41 <shapr> anyone ever heard of him?
15:56:11 <ski> nope, what about him ?
15:56:23 <shapr> he introduced me to ceramics, korean food, and botany
15:56:39 <shapr> and he's had more Ritalin prescriptions than I have :-)
15:56:45 <dark> What's Ritalin, anyway?
15:57:06 <phubuh> ADD medication, right?
15:57:08 <shapr> yup
15:57:18 <shapr> it's related to amphetamines
15:57:22 <shapr> but it isn't the same thing
15:57:30 <tic> eph is similar to amphetamine, right?
15:57:35 <shapr> sort of...
15:57:38 <shapr> more distantly
15:57:47 <shapr> ephedrine has a whole slew of other effects
15:58:27 <shapr> methylphenidate (ritalin) supposedly stimulates the frontal lobes, it's claimed to be a more focussed stimulant than amphetamines 
15:58:54 <shapr> so I just found this cool guy on the web again
15:59:00 <shapr> I must contact him again...
16:00:46 <shapr> hi stratocaster 
16:01:00 <shapr> dark: did that answer your question?
16:18:01 <shapr> hi joe
16:27:13 <shapr> is there any literature on writing network servers in Haskell?
16:27:23 <shapr> not that I'm expecting any positive responses....
16:30:10 <esap> I guess network servers are as easy to write in Haskell than in most other functional languages (hmm.. except maybe Erlang, which I understand makes it easy)
16:32:06 * esap knows no literature on doing servers specifically in Haskell.
16:41:15 <dark> shapr: It did :)
17:12:53 <shapr> dark: sadly, Sweden couldn't get on the ball if it was deflated, I've been here a year, and it could take another year for me to get a prescription in this country.
17:21:17 <dark> shapr: They have to diagnose you with something first?
17:22:02 <shapr> I still don't know if they'll believe papers from the US
17:23:18 <Darius> Them Americans are shady.
17:27:59 <Darius> So, I read the latest WASH/CGI paper (and a few papers around it) and it looks like it accomplishes it's goal quite well.
17:31:25 <dark> What's its goal?
17:32:49 <Darius> Presumably, to present CGI programs as single session-oriented program with a (relatively) high-degree of safety while avoiding common issues.
17:32:56 <shapr> oh, I'd like to hear more about that...
17:33:05 <shapr> but after I sleep :-)
17:34:49 <dark> Hmm, when I looked at it, the degree of safety was what I found lacking.
17:35:06 <dark> WASHHTML makes no effort to encode attribute values, for example. It just assumes they're safe.
17:36:31 <dark> I didn't look too closely at its CGI model because its reliance on a series of POST queries was something I wanted to avoid :)  I'm a firm believer in the "POST for submissions, GET for queries" model.
17:37:29 <dark> The idea behind WASHHTML was nice, though.
17:39:34 <Darius> What's the difference to the end-user or the programmer between POST and GET?
17:40:30 <Darius> Well, I guess POST makes it so that you can't copy the URL, though I don't see how you would want that for a session.
17:51:14 <Darius> (As for the attributes, it seems that they would be amenable to the same techniques as the XHTML so that might be a useful addition)
18:19:24 <dark> Darius: POST also means you can't just hit reload.
18:21:07 <dark> Darius: But that's actually the part I don't like, it binds you into "a session".  I like to be able to look something up and bookmark that query, for example.
18:27:07 <Darius> dark: But queries wouldn't work for a session, would they?  So support for GET would seem to be little more than something like query :: (Mapping String String -> IO HTML) -> IO () that would work "off to the side".
18:28:05 <Darius> A little more integration could be made, I imagine.
18:28:22 <dark> Darius: Well, consider a financial site where you can configure what kind of graph you want, and then query the current chart.
18:28:54 <dark> Darius: It should be possible to bookmark that chart, and get updated prices every time you reload.
18:32:34 <Darius> If you are configuring the graph all on one form, then I agree WASH doesn't support that so conveniently, but it would be simple to add for completeness and doesn't seem like what WASH is aiming at.  If it's configured via a session interface, simply end on a page with a link that uses GET (or you can probably do it directly).
18:33:54 <dark> Ah, but normal usage is to keep fiddling with the chart :)
18:34:34 <dark> That's what I do, at least.
18:34:53 <Darius> Okay, start with a GET too.  Is there a scenario where you want a GET in the middle that's related to the current session?
18:38:21 <dark> Well, yes.  When I play online games, most of my queries are GET.  For example I'll use POST to send my spies to count tanks in another country, then use GET to see my current military status, and another POST to send an attack, then GET to see my country status, POST to build on my new land, etc.  I generally use multiple tabs to manage it all.
18:39:55 <dark> There's usually a menu somewhere (often in another frame) with links to the common queries.
18:41:10 <dark> I'd probably generate a new menu with each page, though, just because I dislike what frames do to scrolling on the user side.
18:43:26 <dark> I was hoping to avoid an example of this complexity, but writing online games was why I looked at WASH in the first place :)
18:43:28 <Darius> What happens if you copy a GET URL and send it to someone else?
18:44:11 <dark> They'll work if the other person is logged in, and will show the appropriate information for their game position insted.
18:44:34 <dark> All of the games I've seen use a cookie for the session key, you see.
18:45:30 <Darius> Okay, why do you care (as a user) that it uses it GET?
18:45:33 <dark> I guess you could put the user ID in the query, and that could be somewhat useful in games where there are alliances.  I've never seen that done, though.
18:46:26 <dark> Darius: GET is safe to reload :)  And that happens a lot, either because the game situation can change in realtime, or because a page doesn't always arrive.
18:55:11 <Darius> Wouldn't WASH POSTs be safe to reload as well.
18:55:14 <Darius> ?
18:55:36 <dark> Probably... most of them :)  But the browser can't distinguish so it will warn with all of them.
18:56:17 <dark> For example, reloading the "spy report" page will probably send your spies again, and some of them can die.  So that has a cost.  But reloading the "infrastructure report" page is not a problem.
18:56:30 <dark> Currently my browser will warn me about the difference.
18:58:18 <dark> It would be nice if there was a way to distinguish between "reload THIS spy report" (for example because it arrived half-complete) and "reload to get a NEW spy report" (to get updated data).  Currently there seems to be no way to get the former; WASH might do that.
18:59:23 <dark> Note that these online games inherently need to have a lot of access to a central database, because there are lots of players operating in a common game environment.  That's not necessarily true for the one I'm designing, which will be more turn-based.
18:59:54 <dark> So there might not even be a way to "reload THIS spy report", unless the database has time travel support.
19:04:22 <dark> Hmm, a webforum might be a less complicated example of the same phenomenon.  New articles get added to threads in real time (i.e. outside the user's session).  The browser should make a clear distinction between "this reload will show you the new articles" and "this reload will post your article a second time".  That's exactly what GET versus POST is supposed to mean.
19:04:55 <dark> Though I think a good webforum should simply ignore duplicate posts :)
19:18:02 <Darius> Well, I guess you have a point.  I think WASH/CGI avoids many of the larger issues with reposting by design, but no matter what reposting will be annoying.
19:29:18 <Darius> Adding a combinator to use GET for a page looks like it would be pretty easy but I think it would be a weak point in WASH.
19:29:24 <dark> Yeah, it's possible that I wouldn't need the reload button so much with a WASH application :)  But I don't know how I would structure one to avoid it.
19:29:50 <dark> Darius: I think the main reason WASH doesn't use GET is that it wants to use a lot of hidden variables.  GET has limited space for variables.
19:29:58 <dark> And of course they're not hidden.
19:32:36 <Darius> Yes, but it could simply use the "normal" session-id/server-side state approach for that part; i.e. simply store (most of) the hidden state server-side.
19:49:44 <keir> i've got a very newbie haskell question.
19:49:54 <keir> what's the best way to represent a 2d array of cards?
19:49:57 <keir> ie playing cards
19:50:02 <keir> this is for a card game i'm making
19:50:08 <keir> should i use a custom data type?
19:50:25 <Darius> That isn't enough information.  What do you want to do with this array?
19:50:40 <keir> well, at first i want two users to be able to play the game
19:50:50 <keir> where each one places a card somewhere in a 5X5 grid of cards
19:50:53 <keir> until it fills up
19:51:02 <keir> and once i get that working i'm going to write an AI player
19:51:17 <keir> so
19:51:29 <keir> inside this 25 element grid, i want to have cards.
19:51:52 <keir> data Card = number suit?
19:52:01 <keir> gah my brain doesn't work in haskell yet
19:52:12 <keir> today i was doing VHDL... and i only know verilog
19:52:47 <keir> i realize this isn't a very 'functional' problem
19:52:55 <keir> but i want to do it in haskell anyway
19:53:17 <keir> a list of lists perhaps?
19:55:04 <Darius> At only a 5x5 array, I doubt any representation will be unacceptably efficient.  So there are a variety of things: lists of lists are one, 2D array is another, a 5-tuple of 5-tuples may also be an option.
19:55:10 <keir> is there some reason why 'import Array' gives a syntax error in the interactive interpreter?
19:55:19 <keir> Darius ok.
19:55:19 <Darius> (-in-efficient)
19:55:56 <Darius> keir: because you can't import at the repl.  In fact, you can't declare anything at the repl.
19:56:02 <keir> oh
19:56:03 <keir> ok
19:56:13 <Darius> (Though GHCi let's you declare functions with let)
19:56:15 <keir> that seems kind of arbitrary
20:03:57 <dark> Doesn't ghci have some command for importing modules?
20:04:18 <dark> keir: Can grid positions be empty?
20:04:31 <dark> keir: Another possibility is to have a list of (position, card) tuples.
20:05:21 <Darius> Yes, :m.
20:05:58 <dark> keir: And you don't really need to choose :)  You can write functions to convert it into whatever format is convenient for what you want to do.  I think there's even a standard function for creating an array from such a list of tuples.
20:26:49 <keir> yes, they need to be empty
20:44:08 <dark> keir: Then you either need a NoCard constructor in your card type (so that you can fill a 5x5 matrix), or you need to go with the [(position, card)] list so that you only have to specify cards for positions that have them.
20:44:18 <dark> Or you can go with Maybe Card in your array.
23:59:07 <shapr> @yow
23:59:08 <lambdabot> Uh-oh!!  I forgot to submit to COMPULSORY URINALYSIS!
