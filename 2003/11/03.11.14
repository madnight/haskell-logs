00:04:02 <earthy> good morning #haskell!
03:27:49 <kosmikus> Lor: try http://cvs.cs.uu.nl/
04:26:08 <Lor> kosmikus, yeah, I found it eventually.
04:26:38 <Lor> But it is advertised _nowhere_. I had to find the full repository path from a usenet posting by D. Swierstra.
04:28:45 <Lor> It was most frustrating when the slides said "get the latest from cvs", but deigned to mention any more details.
04:36:44 <kosmikus> sorry, the talk has been presented internally; most people in the audience had more information than you do
04:37:09 <kosmikus> but I mentioned cvs.cs.uu.nl yesterday already here on IRC
04:37:17 <shapr> and it's mentioned on HaWiki
04:37:23 <kosmikus> is it?
04:37:30 <shapr> I think so
04:37:31 * shapr looks
04:37:55 <shapr> yes, at the bottom here: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LibrariesAndTools
04:38:03 <shapr> UUST is mentioned.
04:38:26 <kosmikus> yes, but not lhs2TeX
04:38:30 <shapr> that's true
04:38:41 <kosmikus> I should just release it
04:38:46 <shapr> yah!
04:38:58 <kosmikus> but I'm away for the next two weeks, and I won't do it today, so ...
04:39:32 <Lor> btw, it's a bit ugly that the import path is hard coded, and doesn't take into account the parameters to the configure script
04:39:56 <shapr> sounds like a good opportunity to submit patches!
04:40:28 <kosmikus> Lor: a bit
04:40:35 <Lor> Well yeah. It means there has to be a ./configure --generated haskell-file.
04:41:10 <kosmikus> Lor: you can also go via wrapper script and have no hardcoded path at all
04:41:56 <Lunar^> Arg
04:42:00 <kosmikus> Lor: you can already do that yourself now, setting the location you want via -P
04:42:15 <shapr> I want to make a :-P operator.
04:42:24 <shapr> it must do something derisive though...
04:42:49 <Lunar^> I'm writing a small assembler, and I would be happy to use lazyness to compute label positions, but I'm stuck on how to do it
04:43:13 <Lunar^> to compute expressions relative to label positions actually
04:44:45 <Lunar^> I don't know how Parsec monadic structure could interfere with it
04:45:08 <shapr> sounds cool, but I have no ideas
04:45:14 <shapr> wli used to write stuff like that
04:45:21 <shapr> haven't seen him around here in awhile though.
04:45:32 <Lunar^> :(
04:45:41 <Lunar^> I'm going to use my intuition, see if it'll work
04:46:05 <shapr> I tried that once, I blew a fuse ;-)
04:46:12 <Lunar^> Is this having sense : (env, ops) <- p env 0 [] ?
04:46:19 <Lunar^> p is my parser
04:46:47 <shapr> can you explain what you mean by computing expressions relative to label positions?
04:47:37 <Lunar^> You can write things like this :
04:47:38 <Lunar^> lc
04:47:44 <Lunar^> sorry... lc r1, live-w+1
04:47:48 <Lunar^> live and w are labels
04:48:11 <Lunar^> But I only know their offsets after parsing all my source
04:48:25 <shapr> oh, I see
04:48:28 <Lunar^> Sounds a good client for lazyness
04:49:11 <Lunar^> So, the 'p' function replies with the final environement, and a list of operation
04:49:29 <Darius> Lunar^: No the above doesn't make sense as you've written it.
04:49:41 <Lunar^> Darius: I was pretty sure of that ;)
04:49:55 <Darius> It would be like p env 0 [] >>= \(env,ops) -> ... env wouldn't be in scope.
04:50:10 <Lunar^> Darius: written that way it's clear
04:50:30 <Darius> You need something more like let (env,ops) = parse env 0 []
04:50:53 <Lunar^> Darius: Parsec is monadic (and powerful) unfortunately
04:51:38 <Darius> You do it outside the parser.  You should be done parsing by the time you get the environment.
04:52:23 <Lunar^> The point is that I made my expression have type :: Env -> Parser Value (with type Value = Int)
04:52:30 <Lunar^> my expression parser sorry
04:52:48 <Lunar^> Am I on a dead end ?
04:53:53 <Darius> Yes, that is the right type (or you could likely use Parsec's user state facilities)  You just need an ultimate Parser (Env,Value) that just returns the final environment.
04:54:56 <Lunar^> Darius: I don't get it, sorry
04:57:03 <Darius> Actually, it isn't the right type, you need to have every combinator return an env (well ones that may modify it) or alternatively use Parsec's user state operations.
04:59:03 <Lunar^> Darius: p :: Env -> Position -> [Operation] -> Parser (Env, [Operation])
04:59:21 <Lunar^> pValue is only used to parse an instruction argument
05:00:52 <Lunar^> If I use Parsec state facility, pValue will use the current env, and not the final env, or I am missing something ?
05:03:37 * isomer is away: lab
05:08:32 <Darius> What's passed in (i.e. what the state is initialized to) is the final environment.
05:14:18 <Lunar^> ok
05:14:44 <Lunar^> so I was on the good way with (env, ops) <- p ... env ...
05:14:56 <Lunar^> But I can't use that because of the monad
05:15:07 <Lunar^> I would work with something like (env, ops) = p ... env ..., right ?
05:15:15 <Lunar^> forgot the let sorry
05:16:43 <Darius> Lunar^: Yes, but you'd only need that in one place; where you actually run the parser.
05:17:10 <Lunar^> mhhh now I see
05:17:17 <Lunar^> I can't use parseFromFile then
05:17:25 <Lunar^> But that's not a big deal
05:19:15 <Darius> Lunar^:  If you used Parsec's state then you'll need to use something that initializes the state, if you handle it yourself (or use a StateT) then you could.
05:19:53 <Darius> I'm not sure if the strictness will be right with Parsec.  I'll change an example I have using this technique to use Parsec.
05:22:35 <Lunar^> I don't need a StateT
05:23:08 <Lunar^> I'm making the change, we'll see if it'll works then
05:25:15 <Darius> Well, one thing that I think is an issue is that error checking doesn't work (or at least not the same).
05:25:49 <Lunar^> Darius: saw that
05:26:15 <Lunar^> Users are the plague of programming... they need error messages :(
05:27:36 <Darius> I'm thinking that you could get the strictness right by using a lookup function that checked whether the environment existed.
05:28:10 <Lunar^> Could you explain more ?
05:30:20 <Darius> The problem is that you pass in the environment depending on whether the parse succeeds which depends on the environment.
05:30:37 <Lunar^> right
05:30:58 <Darius> Written right all that does is cause an irrefutable pattern match failure, but you want the actual message.
05:31:37 <Darius> So more specifically the problem is that it's too eager to check whether the parse succeeds.
05:32:41 <Lunar^> Mhh
05:32:44 <Darius> If instead we pass in the -whole- result (i.e. the Either ParseError Env) then we can check whether the parse succeeded lazily, if it didn't we just fail with the ParseError message.
05:33:11 <Darius> Or at least that's what I'm thinking.
05:33:14 <Lunar^> Good solution, but I want to see if it works first
05:33:50 <Lunar^> the other one is to use parseTest, but it's really inefficient
05:52:30 <shapr> @yow
05:52:56 <shapr> ?
05:52:59 <shapr> lambdabot: HELLO
05:53:06 <shapr> uh oh
05:53:33 <shapr> sheisa, I think I killed that box :-(
05:57:49 <Darius> scheisse or is that svenska ?
06:02:06 <shapr> I just can't spell german for shit
06:02:10 * shapr appreciates that evil pun
06:02:40 <Darius> You know what would probably be a good idea?  A base case for recursion.
06:07:25 <shapr> Darius: for puns?
06:08:56 <Lunar^> Darius: it works :)\
06:09:14 <shapr> ohio gozymous juhp 
06:13:26 <earthy> Scheiss? :)
06:13:37 <shapr> I prefer the word "gezeik"
06:14:01 <Darius> Lunar^: circularly? and with proper error messages?
06:14:10 <earthy> yeah, but that's for an activity, whereas shit can be used for inanimate objects
06:14:18 <shapr> hm
06:15:28 <earthy> (makes for much more interesting swearing vocabulary :))
06:16:08 <earthy> `gezeik' mostly connotes with `nagging'
06:16:16 <shapr> hmm
06:16:26 <earthy> though it is broader. :)
06:16:28 <shapr> I didn't know that.
06:16:41 <earthy> well, now you do. :)
06:16:46 <shapr> thanks
06:17:44 <TripleDES> hi
06:17:50 <shapr> hello TripleDES 
06:17:52 <shapr> what's up?
06:18:04 <TripleDES> just back from uni
06:18:06 <TripleDES> :)
06:18:29 <shapr> learn anything cool?
06:19:22 <TripleDES> some of Computer & Ethics
06:19:44 <TripleDES> I prefer Thursday classes...Funktional prog & compilers
06:19:49 <TripleDES> more interesting
06:20:01 <shapr> we put teh funk in funktional :-)
06:21:16 <TripleDES> :)
06:22:41 <shapr> yikes, I've started typing teh
06:23:15 <shapr> I think funktion and funktional are german
06:23:18 <shapr> and swedish
06:23:21 <shapr> possibly even dutch
06:25:14 <kosmikus> no, not dutch, and in .de it's Funktion with a capital F :)
06:26:17 <shapr> ah, tack!
06:26:30 <shapr> what's functional programming called in dutch?
06:31:47 <kosmikus> functioneel programmeren
06:31:52 <shapr> nifty
06:40:56 <shapr> hej tic 
06:49:17 <tic> tjabba sha
06:49:18 <tic> shapr
07:17:50 <earthy> Hier bekommt man den Funk in funktionale Programmierung? (Klingt nicht so ganz richtig, irgendwie)
07:19:55 <shapr> hi anduril1
08:01:36 <shapr> @yow
08:01:36 <lambdabot> Where does it go when you flush?
08:01:37 <shapr> yay
08:06:00 <magr> "Hier gibt's den Funk der funktionalen Programmierung."
08:06:12 <magr> how about that?
08:55:36 <shapr> I think I have to add these quotes to the HaskelIrcChannel wiki page
08:59:01 <Igloo> Cool, comlab still (for not very much longer) supports addresses of the form igloo@uk.ac.ox.comlab
08:59:21 <shapr> how does that work?
08:59:25 <shapr> reverse dns?
09:01:05 <Igloo> It was the address form JANet decided on aaaaages ago, but everyone else decided on the other way round so it was deprecated and they followed the rest of the world
09:01:31 <Igloo> Back in the change from bang paths to hostnames
09:01:50 <shapr> JANet had a brain
09:02:01 <shapr> tab completion should go from most general to most specific imho
09:11:59 <shapr> hiya
09:12:07 <norbert> hi
09:12:17 <shapr> norbert: have you been here before?
09:12:28 <norbert> yes,under a different nick i think
09:12:31 <shapr> ah, ok
09:12:44 <shapr> so you've probably heard the sales pitch already then.
09:13:00 <norbert> sales pitch?
09:13:10 <harsha123> hi all!
09:13:19 <shapr> yes, where I give the url to the learning Haskell page, show off some examples...
09:13:20 <shapr> that whole bit
09:13:43 <norbert> oh, ya im intermediate i guess, i know a bit allready
09:13:57 <shapr> ok, do you have any questions?
09:14:05 <norbert> yes
09:14:43 <norbert> im curious how u browse modules, through the lib docs, :browse in ghci,..?
09:14:58 <shapr> I use the Haddock docs most of the time
09:15:27 <norbert> the names arent sorted ..
09:15:34 <norbert> alphabetically
09:15:41 <shapr> that's true, they're hierarchical.
09:16:41 <norbert> Ive written a little prog, which reads the output from :browse and sorts it, it works better for me
09:16:50 <shapr> oh, that's neat
09:18:12 <norbert> echo ":browse List"|ghci -v0|myProg >List  works well
09:19:27 <norbert> its funny that the output from :brose apperantly isnt sorted in any way
09:19:32 <Darius> Now integrate it with vim/emacs/your editor of choice to open it in a buffer.
09:19:56 <norbert> i use vim:)
09:20:28 <harsha123> shapr what about your project, a window manager in haskell? 
09:20:29 <shapr> C-u M-! echo ":browse List"|ghci -v0|sort"
09:20:32 <shapr> harsha123: great idea!
09:21:38 <harsha123> shapr  that was yours!
09:21:44 <shapr> well, it's still a good idea
09:21:46 <norbert> that wouldnt handlnt list the class,data,type,etc declarations seperatly
09:21:51 <shapr> that's true.
09:22:03 <harsha123> i was just enquring! 
09:22:46 <harsha123> enquiring..
09:22:49 <shapr> well
09:22:58 <shapr> I'd rather work on the anti spam server first.
09:23:32 <harsha123> hmm..where is it right now? what stage?
09:24:00 <shapr> wild hand waving
09:24:33 <shapr> actually, I just got the Echo.hs network example to compile and run
09:25:37 <harsha123> ok
09:26:36 <shapr> steps left are, implementation of SMTP and POP3 in Haskell, and writing a network server to run them on
09:26:50 <shapr> just three small steps :-)
09:27:42 <harsha123> hmmm.. i guess SMTP is already implemented,isnt' it?
09:27:53 <norbert> the largest haskell prg i ever wrote is said filter in 20 lines :)
09:28:31 <shapr> harsha123: I haven't seen an implementation
09:28:41 <shapr> norbert: on to greater victories!
09:28:51 <harsha123> shapr  is  http://scannedinavian.org/  up?
09:28:55 <shapr> sort of...
09:29:05 <harsha123> i can't connect to it!
09:29:06 <shapr> the apache server is unhappy.
09:29:23 <shapr> and it died when I was trying to upgrade libc6, so I suspect it'll die again if I try it again.
09:29:45 <harsha123> whats running? testing?
09:29:50 <shapr> nah, sid
09:29:51 <harsha123> unstable?
09:29:55 <shapr> yup
09:29:59 <harsha123> Ok
09:30:18 <shapr> it's strange, my local box didn't die when I upgraded libc6
09:30:40 <harsha123> hmm..
09:30:59 <shapr> probably because I was upgrading via an ssh connection
09:31:20 <harsha123> do you use daemontools?
09:31:25 <shapr> no
09:31:29 <shapr> heard of it, haven't used it.
09:31:30 <harsha123> ok
09:31:37 <shapr> you think it'll help me?
09:32:19 <harsha123> i guess, cause it has a /service directroy where all the processes are managed
09:32:31 <harsha123> they can be controlled by a command called svc
09:33:08 <harsha123> and you immmediately know when a process running in /service dies...
09:33:45 <shapr> so, if I'm using ssh to connect, and then I upgrade libc6, it tries to restart sshd, right?
09:34:13 <harsha123> do you ssh to your web server?
09:34:22 <shapr> yup
09:34:26 <shapr> it's in another city
09:34:32 <shapr> on a 10Mb line
09:34:55 <harsha123> hmm, is it some dependency problem?
09:35:01 <shapr> I don't know.
09:35:10 <shapr> I could try to upgrade libc6 again ...
09:35:35 <harsha123> is sshd the latest version? 
09:36:15 <norbert> do u know a way to "intersperse,inject" a command to a running ghci session? That is a ghci session with a prompt, where stdin is from a terminal.
09:37:16 <norbert> i mean, how to give it a command from a differnet terminal
09:37:55 <norbert> i thought there should be an easeier way than using prgs like screen
09:39:29 <norbert> in general, how do i change stdin for a running terminal program?
09:49:00 <harsha123> shapr are those your poems? your diary entry? :)
10:09:51 <shapr> harsha123: where?
10:12:19 <keverets> shapr: it should restart the sshd, but that shouldn't affect your current session (afaik).  Did you try it?  Did it work?
10:12:46 <harsha123> shapr was reading you diary entries..:)
10:12:49 <shapr> harsha123: oh, cool
10:12:58 <shapr> keverets: I haven't tried it again, but I may...
10:13:16 <shapr> whatever happened last time stopped everything; apache, zope, sshd, etc
10:14:11 <harsha123> shapr did it reconfigure these packages?
10:16:20 <shapr> I have the latest sshd, but not apache
10:16:30 <shapr> I wonder if something else entirely happened
10:16:48 <harsha123> and does apache depend on the new libc6?
10:17:41 <shapr> yup
10:17:52 <harsha123> guess thats the problem..
10:17:59 <shapr> probably so
10:19:00 <harsha123> shapr do you know there is a method to keep the old package, while upgrading the new one, in case of dependencies..
10:21:44 <shapr> well, I'll try upgrading libc6 directly
10:21:52 <shapr> if it explodes, at least I know what the problem is...
10:22:05 <harsha123> ok
10:22:49 <shapr> that wasn't very scary.
10:24:41 <harsha123> but i've always faced problem with my fonts with a new debian install, infact i aint satisfied with my fonts even now :(
10:25:01 <harsha123> shapr any solutions?
10:25:40 <shapr> yes
10:25:43 <shapr> user error :-)
10:26:20 <harsha123> what?
10:26:42 <shapr> I'd forgotten that the hostname is set incorrectly
10:26:53 <shapr> so apache wouldn't start, it couldn't resolve a bad hostname
10:26:59 <shapr> doh!
10:27:05 <harsha123> ok, hehehe..
10:28:30 <harsha123> ok, yep am connected
10:30:58 <shapr> hi maihem
10:34:28 <esap> here's a difficult question: how would it be possible to simulate the effect of the following program: \p -> case p of { Nothing -> x ; Just (x,y) -> y } [This is invalid, but imagine some weird language extension that would allow this]. What would be its type?
10:36:07 <ibid> do you mean \p -> case p of { Nothing -> x ; Just (z, y) | z == x -> y }?
10:36:28 <ibid> if not, i don't know what your expression should do
10:36:51 <esap> not quite.
10:38:36 <esap> The idea is that I want to create a 'dependency' from one case branch to another, such that there is a control transfer from one point of the program to another. You somehow require two uses of that thing, one that passes in 'Nothing' and another that passes in Just (a,b) ... the idea is that the second value is transferred from one use to another.
10:40:12 <Darius> What are some example reductions?
10:41:04 <esap> say this thing is called X. then   X(Just(10,20)) + X(Nothing) --> 30
10:42:10 <Darius> What does it do if you just have X(Nothing)?
10:42:51 <esap> Well probably the typing for that has to ensure that in the context there is a matching uses of X.
10:43:54 <esap> I'm not sure how to type that.
10:44:11 <esap> I guess something involving subtraction.
10:44:24 <maihem> hi shapr
10:44:38 <maihem> sorry, I wasn't paying attention :)
10:45:23 <Darius> I don't see how you would either, but if everything is nicely paired off, depending on how you want to use it and the behaviour you expect it could be implemented with local state.
10:46:54 <maihem> I realised that the way I wanted to do my signal transform is decidedly imperative, so I'm thinking twice
10:47:27 <esap> darius: I was thinking about continuations, but hmm.. maybe local state works as well.
10:56:36 <esap> darius: actaully, X(Just(10,20)) is probably like declaration "let x=10 in 20" and "X(Nothing)" is like the use of the variable x, but with some funky scoping.
10:57:58 <Darius> Yes, the "scoping" is the dynamic extent of the closed over mutable variable.
11:11:46 <esap> darius: what if I just type that thing like this: X :: Maybe (a,b) -> Either a b
11:13:18 <Darius> The type from an (semi-)imperative implementation would simply be, Maybe (a,a) -> a.
11:13:43 <esap> yes, that is another choice.
11:15:23 <esap> actually, it might even be better, because it somewhat looks like F (G A) -> A, for an adjunction F -| G
11:18:36 * esap likes adjunctions.
11:21:34 <esap> But it's not quite that simple. You have to somehow label matching pairs. Not handled by that type.
11:25:50 <Darius> This is all predicated on the fact that you've paired things up already.  How to do -that- (and why) is a different question.
11:28:34 <esap> darius: The why is that I think case could in principle be used to express some kind of layering structure [just like function (composition) is in some sense able to express sequentiality]
11:30:21 <esap> darius: s/case/'case'/
11:30:53 <esap> And I'm trying to use duality to express this.
11:31:47 <esap> The worst problem I have in doing this is that I don't know how to invert Maybe.
11:33:30 <Darius> How do "invert" sums (Either), how do you "invert" unit (()), how do you "invert" a type variable?
11:34:31 <esap> I think Either and subtraction are inverses. () and _|_ are inverses and type-level substitution is inverse for type variable.
11:35:34 <esap> Sums are actually hard case, because the semantics of subtraction is not that clear.
11:36:23 <esap> But Maybe is the simplest thing I could figure that would present the same problem.
11:37:38 <esap> darius: the reason I can invert Either but not Maybe is that there is no value associated with Nothing. For anything that has one type argument and each branch uses it, I think I know how to do this. But when the value is missing, the inverse is harder.
11:38:31 <esap> darius: because simplistic way of doing it causes that the inverse of Nothing is undefined. But I don't think that's the correct semantics.
11:40:42 <esap> darius: that is why I think about dependencies between case branches :-)
11:42:27 <esap> darius: the interpretation of subtraction type is like any type, but there is an additional structure [border] that splits the type into two disjoint parts. This allows you to define control operation.
11:45:28 <esap> darius: but that doesn't work if one of the types is empty, and I don't know how to map constants there.
11:49:18 <Darius> Why do you think Either and subtraction are inverses?
11:50:52 <esap> (a -> Either b c) -> (a\\b -> c)  and its inverse would form adjunction, I think.
11:52:16 <esap> The original idea comes from the 'Subtractive logic' paper by Crolard.
11:52:28 <Darius> An adjunction is between functors, what are the two functors.
11:52:55 <esap> _ \\ a -| Either a _
11:52:56 <Darius> In that paper, doesn't Crolard associate 'subtraction' with function types.
11:53:11 <esap> yes, subtraction is _dual_ to function types.
11:54:55 <esap> Since (a,_) -| a -> _, if you dualise this, you get _ \\ a -| Either a _  I'd expect.
11:55:22 <Darius> -\\a -| Either a - says nothing (or little) about how the bifunctors are related.
12:00:08 <esap> what information is missing? Do you want a definition of _\\a? I'm trying to understand what it would be :-)
12:01:13 <esap> I think the other functor should be uniquely defined by the adjunction.
12:02:15 <Darius> Just because (a,-) -| a -> -, not much is said about the relation between (-,-) and - -> -, obviously something like (a,b) -> x | x -> [a -> b] doesn't make sense.
12:05:17 <esap> heh, ok, I'm not trying to understand the bifunctors yet, just "Either a" and _\\a. I think that should be easier than trying to understand the whole thing.
12:06:14 <esap> But my hypothesis is that a\\b is subtraction of the types (if you'd consider types as sets, then the interpretation would be obvious)
12:07:38 <esap> a\\b is a type that is like 'a' but there is a hole shaped like the type 'b' that doesn't belong to the type a\\b.
12:08:47 <esap> So some terms that have type 'a' doesn't have type a\\b.
12:09:13 <esap> in particular those that also have type b.
12:09:22 <esap> At least that's how I would interpret it.
12:09:28 <Darius> All I'm saying is that it doesn't make sense to say Either and subtraction are inverses based on the above (potential) adjunction, what would be "inverses" are (Either a) and (\\a)
12:10:02 <esap> oh ok, yes you're right.
12:12:21 <esap> Just a bit sloppy terminology I guess. I do that often :-)
12:13:22 <Darius> I think the adjunction you want is -\\a -| Either a
12:13:31 <Darius> nm
12:13:34 <Darius> that's what you saidh.
12:13:35 <esap> yes.
12:15:24 <esap> I've also constructed term level for that based on duality, e.g. I have dual for lambda abstraction ("control x.y") and dual for function application [x]y, which come directly from the arrows in the adjunction.
12:15:57 <Darius> So what are you looking for now?
12:16:59 <esap> Well since Either a thing seems quite clear, I'm trying to understand what happens if I replace Either a with Maybe.
12:17:33 <esap> Because Maybe has some nice properties (Rec Maybe == Nat)
12:18:11 <esap> This I'd hope goes to understanding how those operations behave.
12:19:03 <Darius> Maybe is just (Either ()) so a function that returns Maybe a is like a function that takes (a\\())
12:19:53 <esap> Yes.
12:20:16 <esap> But what new can be done inside that function due to that?
12:21:25 <esap> I think you can raise exceptions (like in Maybe monad).
12:21:52 <Darius> Nothing that you couldn't simply do in the category anyways.  The adjunction states that functions like that are the same to a point.
12:22:46 <esap> But you can also pattern match against the returned value. I'd expect that should be somehow part of the semantics.
12:22:59 <esap> That is, you can define partial functions with Maybe.
12:24:36 <esap> So you'd expect all that will be available in the subtraction somehow.
12:25:44 <Darius> Indeed, the isomorphism is (I'd be surprised otherwise) the reflect/reify pair (well a bit more explicit).
12:25:58 <esap> So what this means is that if I can write a type checker that understand subtraction types, I can enforce preconditions for partial functions.
12:26:12 <Darius> All that is available in a function that takes (\\a) by using the pieces of the adjunction.
12:26:34 <Darius> I.e. you can "pattern match" the partiality by using the isomorphism to get a Maybe a.
12:27:16 <Darius> That would be like reifying.
12:27:39 <Darius> The isomorphism shows you how to implement catch.
12:28:34 <Darius> Using the isomorphism the other way you can get throw (which is like reflect)(
12:29:42 <esap> hmm.. interesting. I need to look these reify and reflect things more closely.
12:55:59 <shapr> jiihaa

12:56:14 <shapr> minä olen Americalainen!
13:00:43 <ibid> ym amerikkalainen
13:52:32 * esap just realized that interpreters are layers.
14:03:46 <RibenaBoy> hello
14:04:01 <RibenaBoy> can i ask whats the difference between div and "/" ?
14:06:01 <phubuh> div does integer division, / does real division.
14:06:47 <RibenaBoy> oic
14:06:50 <RibenaBoy> what about mod?
14:07:02 <phubuh> mod gets you the remainder after integer division
14:07:29 <RibenaBoy> ahh ic 
14:07:30 <RibenaBoy> thanks
16:49:06 <jameson> I only just noticed that you have IRC logs now... is that a new LamdaBot feature?
22:41:03 * isomer is away: zozo
