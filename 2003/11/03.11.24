01:42:25 <Lunar^> Does anyone knows if people doing WxHaskell are on IRC ?
02:05:31 <earthy> no, they are not.
02:05:48 <earthy> I could ask Daan to try, though...
02:07:32 <Lunar^> I found where the problem was
02:08:11 <Lunar^> ... mixin' WXCore and WX for drawing
02:31:04 <TripleDES> morning
02:32:38 <earthy> ah, yeah, that's indeed a problem.
02:35:18 <kosmikus> moin #haskell
03:11:41 <earthy> moin kosmikus
03:11:58 <earthy> enjoying the home country? :)
03:12:35 <kosmikus> yes
03:12:51 <kosmikus> but I had problems getting here again
03:12:57 * earthy nods
03:12:57 <kosmikus> 3 hours delay yesterday
03:13:13 <earthy> started your trip somewhere in the morning, then? :)
03:13:24 <kosmikus> yeah, has it been on the news?
03:14:07 <earthy> nope, I picked up my gf at Schiphol, so I had the first train from Nijmegen to Schiphol, and then to Den Haag, and then from there back to Nijmegen
03:14:31 <kosmikus> I see
03:14:33 <earthy> so I saw the postings at the railway stations, but I nicely circumvented the problem between Driebergen-Zeist and Maarn, timewise.
03:15:14 <kosmikus> what I don't understand is why they let the train stop in Driebergen-Zeist for 1 hour before they decided to reroute via Amersfoort ...
03:15:42 <earthy> kosmikus: communication. especially the lack thereof.
03:16:09 <kosmikus> somehow they must have communicated, though; just not efficiently
03:16:16 * earthy nods
03:16:43 <earthy> I first saw the problemnotice at 10:30ish
03:16:46 <kosmikus> the plan to redirect the train was the "train manager's" very first idea, and he actually announced that they would do that to the passengers
03:17:02 <earthy> it takes time to get that through to railwaycontrol
03:17:11 <kosmikus> but instead of actually executing the plan, they waited for another hour
03:17:16 <earthy> and then it takes railwaycontrol time to reroute.
03:17:27 <kosmikus> argl
03:17:29 <earthy> and then it takes time to get the rerouting back to the train director.
03:17:55 <kosmikus> how's life in Utrecht?
03:18:00 <earthy> nice and quiet. :)
03:18:02 <kosmikus> any news back home?
03:18:23 <earthy> well... Doaitse is hard at work making sure he can leave. ;)
03:18:32 <kosmikus> I can imagine
03:18:34 <earthy> other than that thing's are normal :)
03:18:51 <kosmikus> good
03:19:07 <kosmikus> I'll be away for lunch now ...
03:19:14 <earthy> have a good one
03:19:57 * shapr awakens for lunch
03:22:33 <Lunar^> hi shapr 
03:22:40 <earthy> hey there
03:22:41 <shapr> hi Lunar^!
03:23:00 <Lunar^> WxHaskell is definetly promising.. once you know how to trick it
03:24:31 <shapr> hey Lunar^, I'm trying to track down all the wiwiwi improvements, do you have anything other than what's in hlibs?
03:25:25 <Lunar^> shapr: about wiwiwi ?
03:25:30 <shapr> yes
03:25:35 <Lunar^> shapr: nothing
03:25:41 <shapr> also, I tried to get GHCiModule working yesterday, but I got link errors
03:25:46 <Lunar^> shapr :(
03:25:52 <Lunar^> shapr: You should send a mail to sebc
03:25:54 <shapr> I added -fffi to the Makefile, but I think I need a -lsomething
03:25:59 <shapr> I did send him an email
03:26:37 <Lunar^> shapr: I don't think so. Shell.hs use only plain libc
03:27:35 <shapr> hm
03:37:20 <shapr> y0 o3
03:37:47 <o3> g'day
03:48:15 <shapr> how's the warm continent treating you?
03:50:05 <o3> not too bad all up
03:50:30 <o3> working hard, playing hard, and getting sleep too
03:50:33 <o3> so can't complain at all, really :)
04:29:22 <shapr> jiihaa!
04:33:41 <Lor> If anyone's interested in where type research is going nowadays, this is a pretty cool overview I found: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/tng-lics2003-slides.pdf
04:36:04 <Lunar^> Lor: I read it.... it's really intersting but there's some misconceptions
04:36:22 <Lunar^> Lor: (which reveals that they're shared by a lot of peopl)
04:36:47 <Lor> Oh? Such as?
04:37:11 <Lunar^> Lor: There's types for humans and types for computers
04:37:50 <Lor> Yes, there are human programming languages and intermediate languages. Both can use types.
04:39:02 <Lunar^> Lor: mhh even for human programming language, one could be happy to have really complex types
04:39:07 <Lunar^> Lor: for an IDE by example
04:40:06 <Lor> Possibly. I'm not sure.
04:40:42 <Lor> If types are something that are handled by the IDE and not by the programmer directly, then I'd say it's no longer a "user-level" type system.
04:41:39 <Lor> What has this got to do with those slides?
04:44:54 <Lunar^> Lor: don't remember exactly, but some of them shows a mix between this two levels
04:49:19 <Lunar^> What's the easiest way to profile some code with GHC ?
04:50:23 <Riastradh> With a profiler.
04:50:30 * Riastradh ducks.
04:50:35 <Lunar^> hehe
04:59:19 <Lunar^> mhh wxHaskell was not compiled with prof on
04:59:34 <Lunar^> The rename trick on the Wiki doesn't seem to work
04:59:43 <Lunar^> Do I must recompile the whole (big) thing ?
05:05:50 <shapr> @yow
05:05:50 <lambdabot> YOW!  I can see 1987!!  PRESIDENT FORD is doing the REMAKE of "PAGAN
05:05:50 <lambdabot>  LOVE SONG"...he's playing ESTHER WILLIAMS!!
05:05:56 <shapr> @yow!
05:05:56 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "yow!", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:05:59 <shapr> @yow ! 
05:05:59 <lambdabot> NOW do I get to blow out the CANDLES??
05:06:55 <Igloo> Wassup, Shae?
05:07:26 <shapr> bounciness!
05:07:31 <shapr> what's up with you?
05:07:36 <Igloo> Good good  :-)
05:07:51 <Igloo> Gettinguptooearlyness
05:08:14 <shapr> when did you get up?
05:08:32 <Igloo> 11:25
05:08:50 <Igloo> (30 mins away from a 12 meeting)
05:09:27 <scharob> Meetings...just one more of this hour taking senseless appointments
05:09:40 <scharob> *g* :-]
05:10:12 <shapr> my scheduled uptime is 8:00am, but I had unscheduled downtime this morning, lasting until 11:00am
05:10:50 <shapr> this new Linux game I found is partially to blame
05:10:53 <scharob> Well as long as you are not in a deadlock shapr...
05:11:02 <shapr> :-)
05:11:11 <scharob> :-D
05:11:18 <Igloo> What game?
05:11:31 <shapr> I went from playing "America's Army" to playing "A Tale In the Desert"
05:11:41 <shapr> I'm having violence withdrawals.
05:12:11 <shapr> Tale is a very cool game
05:12:27 <scharob> Well I persume you left youth (Training Camps) and become an Adult (Mission in Iraq)
05:12:38 <shapr> actually, yes
05:12:40 <scharob> *g*
05:12:43 <shapr> but I could never qualify for sniper
05:13:19 <shapr> on the other hand, I've just created my first student forge in Tale, and am now trying to get some charcoal together so I can build nails for my hackling rake
05:13:37 <shapr> I have a basic flax comb, but it's not nearly as efficient as a hackling rake.
05:13:52 <scharob> What is a hackling rake?
05:14:28 <shapr> it's a tool for dividing flax into useful parts, those parts can make thread and twine
05:14:35 <shapr> thread makes linen, twine makes canvas
05:14:40 <shapr> linen makes...
05:14:53 <shapr> but you need a distaff to turn tow or lint into thread or twine
05:14:54 <scharob> oic
05:15:14 <scharob> beautiful
05:15:16 <shapr> anyways, it's a really relaxing game.
05:15:34 <shapr> the map is *huge*
05:15:46 <shapr> someone I asked said it would take a week of real time for a player to run across the map
05:15:59 <scharob> uhh
05:16:05 <scharob> Are you nuts?
05:16:13 <scharob> ;-)
05:16:24 <shapr> I've set up in the Valley of Kings, in a relatively densely settled location.
05:16:43 <shapr> several universities nearby to increase my skills
05:17:24 <scharob> what skills
05:17:24 <shapr> anyways, if you like simulation or constructor games, Tale is worth trying
05:17:46 <scharob> I do not play games
05:18:03 * scharob is always serious *giggling*
05:18:06 <shapr> I have lots of skills, mining, animal husbandry, farming, etc
05:18:24 <shapr> for example, when your skills get good enough, you can make crossbreeds of flax
05:18:35 <shapr> I got a really nice strain from my guild mentor
05:18:47 <shapr> it grows quickly, produces lots of flax or seeds, and only needs weeding once
05:19:43 <shapr> scharob: played any neat linux games lately?
05:19:44 <scharob> Sounds really to be a lifelong game
05:20:14 <scharob> No I really do not play games
05:20:28 <shapr> I've played about twelve hours total playtime. a trial account gets 24 hours
05:20:32 <scharob> I do not like games
05:20:34 <shapr> I dunno if I'll actually purchase a subscription.
05:20:38 <shapr> why not?
05:20:47 <scharob> It is some kind of boring
05:20:57 <scharob> It does not really interest me
05:21:05 <shapr> yah, I understand.
05:21:32 <shapr> I tend to play a game very much anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, then I drop it and look for another game.
05:21:46 <scharob> You sit there hours and hours and all your leisure is gone...
05:22:02 <shapr> true
05:22:05 <shapr> I could spend that time coding.
05:22:07 <scharob> And you have no time left for your friends....
05:22:15 <scharob> Or other stuff
05:22:30 <shapr> I have no friends! Only IRC!
05:22:33 * shapr is joking
05:23:40 <scharob> Hehe....but I can think of ppl who really do not have anything else than their box and so it gives them the only entertainment, too...games
05:25:18 <scharob> shapr Do you still work on your bot?
05:25:24 <shapr> on lambdabot? sure.
05:25:28 <scharob> Yes
05:25:28 <shapr> I fixed some stuff yesterday.
05:25:43 <shapr> andersca was working on a pizza plugin
05:25:46 <scharob> What was the link again for the sourcecode?
05:25:53 <scharob> pizza?
05:25:59 <shapr> yah, a pizza timer
05:26:03 <scharob> Can it order a pizza for me?
05:26:09 <scharob> Ohhhh
05:26:10 <shapr> I don't think so.
05:26:16 <scharob> time for next lunch?
05:26:28 <shapr> the latest sourcecode is available via darcs from http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs/
05:26:33 <scharob> Or what is a pizza timer *g*
05:26:41 <shapr> I'm going to start making nightly tarballs for those who don't have darcs.
05:26:54 <scharob> what is darcs?
05:27:02 <shapr> http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/
05:27:09 <shapr> it's a source code control system written in Haskell
05:27:14 <scharob> oh
05:27:23 <shapr> David Roundy wrote it, he's a physicist by training
05:27:29 <shapr> so it has a relatively deep patch theory behind it
05:28:29 <scharob> okay
05:29:11 <scharob> Sorry but I need to continue my studies now cul8er!
05:29:29 <shapr> cya
05:32:52 <SyntaxPolice_> howdy
05:33:52 <Igloo> Hey ho
05:35:14 <shapr> hi SyntaxPolice_ 
05:39:24 <shapr> hi elmex 
05:43:14 * SyntaxPolice is so bummed about the security breach at debian.org :(
05:44:03 <shapr> on the good side, it was quickly found and fixed
05:44:17 <shapr> I blame Microsoft! they're hiring crackers to get into linux and the major distros!
05:45:34 <shapr> some of this stuff is scary
05:45:54 <shapr> whoops, mischan
05:47:24 * Igloo finds I've written 3+4 = 12
05:48:00 <shapr> trying to find perfect numbers?
05:48:43 <Igloo> Nah, nothing so interesting
05:58:10 <shapr> Lunar^: sebc's academic email is the same?
06:01:46 <shapr> hm, I think unit testing can show you a domain specific language
06:03:10 <Lunar^> shapr: the same ?
06:03:29 <shapr> er, as it was several months ago?
06:04:54 <Lunar^> shapr: ggl:Sebastien Carlier
06:07:03 <shapr> ok
06:36:22 <shapr> @yow
06:36:23 <lambdabot> Mmmmmm-MMMMMM!!  A plate of STEAMING PIECES of a PIG mixed
06:36:23 <lambdabot>  with the shreds of SEVERAL CHICKENS!!...  Oh BOY!!  I'm
06:36:23 <lambdabot>  about to swallow a TORN-OFF section of a COW'S LEFT LEG
06:36:23 <lambdabot>  soaked in COTTONSEED OIL and SUGAR!!  ..  Let's see..
06:36:23 <lambdabot>  Next, I'll have the GROUND-UP flesh of CUTE, BABY LAMBS
06:36:25 <lambdabot>  fried in the MELTED, FATTY TISSUES from a warm-blooded
06:36:27 <lambdabot>  animal someone once PETTED!!  ...  YUM!!  That was GOOD!!
06:36:29 <lambdabot>  For DESSERT, I'll have a TOFU BURGER with BEAN SPROUTS
06:37:37 <shapr> whoa
06:56:32 <Cale> findPartridge :: Tree (Bird, a) -> Maybe a
06:58:43 <Cale> whoa, maybe the joke was that bad :)
07:00:29 <shapr> heh
07:00:36 <shapr> yay, I got my snow tire for my unicycle!
07:00:45 <Cale> aweesome :)
07:00:47 <shapr> pix available as soon as I persuade the webcam to work again
07:01:37 <Cale> heh, cool - I'll have to see those - it's getting late for class though, so I'd better run
08:00:36 * shapr bounces
08:13:57 <TripleDES> hi
08:15:10 <shapr> y0
08:15:19 <TripleDES> yop
08:49:15 <det> shapr: this game is actually enjoyable? :)
08:50:43 <Tomasso> hello
08:50:55 <Tomasso> mhmh freenode isnt working so good..
08:58:39 <Tomasso> if i have a type like data Test = Hello Int | Bye Int | GoodLuck Int
08:58:45 <Tomasso> and i want to pattern match
08:59:08 <Tomasso> how do i say Any constructor followed by an Int ?
08:59:16 <Tomasso> for example:
08:59:22 <Smerdyakov> You can't.
08:59:34 <Tomasso> f (c x) = smth
09:00:25 <Tomasso> and not fo f (Hello x) = smth, f (Bye x) = smth and f(GoodLuck x) = smth
09:02:13 <SyntaxPolice> Tomasso: a workaround is to say data Test = Hello {testInt::Int} | Bye {testInt::Int} | ...
09:02:33 <SyntaxPolice> f t = foo (testInt t)
09:03:06 <shapr> det: yah, it's actually fun
09:04:01 * SyntaxPolice lunch &
09:07:47 <Tomasso> and what do the {} mean?
09:18:41 * shapr boings
09:19:15 * andersca bounces
09:19:50 * maihem farts
09:22:50 <maihem> @yow
09:22:50 <lambdabot> There's a lot of BIG MONEY in MISERY if you have an AGENT!!
09:37:07 <Norbert> Ah, I know a question: I think I remember somebody here who studies at the "Fernuni Hagen", are you there?
10:01:06 <Tomasso> can anyone tell me a way to avoid this??
10:01:11 <Tomasso> http://168.226.148.45/trabajo/test.hs
10:01:52 <Tomasso> please!
10:06:16 <SyntaxPolice> Tomasso: you can name the functions with the{} syntax I mentioned above.
10:06:47 <Tomasso> SyntaxPolice: i dont understend what it means BUAA!
10:06:55 <SyntaxPolice> http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/moretypes.html
10:07:03 <SyntaxPolice> look at the section that mentions fieldlabels
10:07:15 <Tomasso> SyntaxPolice: let me check
10:07:31 <SyntaxPolice> or likewise here: http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#field-labels
10:08:00 <Tomasso> le me check
10:23:31 <Tomasso> SyntaxPolice: I see now hehe thank you
10:26:01 <SyntaxPolice> Tomasso: no problem
10:54:38 <Tomasso> how do i change a type?
10:54:52 <Tomasso> for example from Int to Double?
10:55:26 <SyntaxPolice> fromIntegral in that case, I believe
10:56:03 <Tomasso> what do you mean?
10:56:26 <SyntaxPolice> you need a function to change the integer value into a double value
10:56:36 <SyntaxPolice> for example, you might have a function:
10:56:43 <SyntaxPolice> intToDouble :: Int -> Double
10:56:51 <SyntaxPolice> @type fromIntegral
10:56:51 <lambdabot> fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
10:57:17 <SyntaxPolice> but in this case, it's changing an "Integral" (which is a typeclass that Int is a part of) to a Number (which is a typeclass that Double is a part of)
11:13:39 <Tomasso> SyntaxPolice: the function intToDouble is not defined
11:23:27 <SyntaxPolice> that was an example.
11:23:37 <SyntaxPolice> like I said, the function wyou want is fromIntegral
11:23:48 <SyntaxPolice> @type fromIntegral
11:23:48 <lambdabot> fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
14:01:29 <shapr> @yow
14:01:29 <lambdabot> Oh my GOD -- the SUN just fell into YANKEE STADIUM!!
14:06:41 <Marvin--> speaking of falling: http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/11/24/klan.initiation.ap/index.html
14:06:52 <andersca> old news
14:06:52 <andersca> ;)
14:07:16 <Marvin--> well sorreee for not reading cnn.com every minute
14:08:16 <Igloo> I always wondered about that when cowboys did it
14:08:23 <shapr> now you know
14:08:28 <shapr> don't point it straight up
14:09:29 <Igloo> That might be OK if air does what I think it might as you go up with the Earth rotating at the bottom
14:10:09 <Igloo> Or does it have the same angular velocity as the Earth "all" the way up?
14:11:44 <sex|more> hello
14:11:58 <sex|more> has someone an idea of the lambda calculus?
14:12:18 <Riastradh> Yes.
14:12:19 <Marvin--> well, yeah...
14:12:50 <sex|more> how can I develope XOR from AND, NOT and OR idea
14:12:54 <sex|more> I have no idea
14:12:59 <sex|more> can someone give me a clue
14:13:14 <Riastradh> sex|more, how are you representing booleans?
14:14:38 <shapr> @yow
14:14:39 <lambdabot> Yow!  I want to mail a bronzed artichoke to Nicaragua!
14:14:55 <shapr> ddarius: hey, want me to create a tarball of the current darcs repo?
14:15:08 <shapr> I could do that for the latest darcs as well, if you want.
14:15:12 <ddarius> shapr: That may be convenient.
14:15:31 * Marvin-- grumbles
14:15:39 <andersca> sex|more: so how is XOR defined
14:15:40 <shapr> ddarius: a, b, or e?
14:15:48 <andersca> make up a truth table
14:15:53 <andersca> find out the characteristics
14:17:25 <Tomasso> i have problems with this expresion : floor (sqrt ((x - w)*(x - w) + (y - d)*(y - d)):: Double)
14:17:35 <shapr> I bet it's not hard to write a shell script to slurp the latest darcs and make a tarball.
14:17:38 * shapr tries
14:17:39 <Tomasso> floor (sqrt ((x - w)*(x - w) + (y - d)*(y - d)):: Double)
14:17:47 <Tomasso> sorry, ERROR "C:\trabajo\TeamB.hs":115 - Type error in type annotation
14:17:47 <Tomasso> *** Term           : sqrt ((x - w) * (x - w) + (y - d) * (y - d))
14:17:47 <Tomasso> *** Type           : Int
14:17:47 <Tomasso> *** Does not match : Double 
14:18:20 <ddarius> "a, b, or e?"?
14:18:21 <andersca> shapr: don't write a shell script
14:18:22 <andersca> use haskell!
14:18:36 <Riastradh> Tomasso, you can't just add a ':: Double' and expect it to be converted magically from an integer to a double.
14:18:43 <sex|more> not in haskell first, first in lambda only
14:18:49 <shapr> andersca: tempting
14:19:03 <Riastradh> sex|more, how are you representing booleans?
14:19:03 <andersca> shapr: like dennisb once said
14:19:13 <Tomasso> Riastradh: let me check
14:19:18 <andersca> "Haskell is not just the best functional language - it's the best imperative language too"
14:19:21 <sex|more> Riastradh: in lanbda?
14:19:29 <Riastradh> sex|more, yes.
14:19:34 <Tomasso> Riastradh: and how do i do that?
14:19:34 <sex|more> T := Lxy.x
14:19:43 <sex|more> F := Lxy.y
14:19:49 <andersca> Riastradh: that's not really important, is it?
14:19:55 <andersca> I mean, you have AND, OR and NOT
14:19:58 <Riastradh> andersca, shut up; you make me sound dumb.
14:20:05 <andersca> then you can implement XOR easily
14:20:09 <andersca> lambda calculus or not
14:20:11 <dennisb> andersca: I'm not the only one who say that. It's a common saying
14:20:20 <andersca> dennisb: well I heard it form you :)
14:20:20 <Tomasso> floor (sqrt ((x - w)*(x - w) + (y - d)*(y - d)):: Float)
14:20:23 <Riastradh> Tomasso, by using one of the conversion functions.
14:20:28 <Tomasso> thats what i wanted to post
14:20:31 <ddarius> Psh, who needs and or or not, use the Scheffer Stroke.
14:20:43 <Marvin--> who was it that said "Haskell is my favourite imperative programming language"?
14:20:44 <Marvin--> Wadler?
14:20:45 <shapr> the what?
14:20:59 <Tomasso> Riastradh: what are those functions?
14:21:08 <Riastradh> Tomasso, '::' is not 'convert to this type'; it's 'that expression has this type.'  But it doesn't work for integers and doubles and such.
14:21:28 <Riastradh> Tomasso, browse through the prelude, and specifically in the numeric typeclasses.
14:21:52 <Tomasso> you say there are functions implemented for conversions?
14:21:56 <Riastradh> Yes.
14:22:24 <Tomasso> hmhm
14:22:35 <shapr> ddarius: http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/~shae/hlibs.tgz
14:23:00 <ddarius> shapr: Thanks.
14:23:44 <shapr> want a darcs tarball too?
14:24:26 <ddarius> yes.
14:51:56 <ddarius> The fifth footnote in this paper is wrong, it should be "^5 '()"
14:56:22 <shapr> ddarius: send them diffs!
14:58:25 * ddarius wonders how long it would take them to realize why it should be that... probably not long.
14:59:12 <shapr> yay, darcs get has reached 2002
14:59:34 <shapr> y0zone
15:04:07 <ddarius> @define nand \a b. not (a && b)
15:04:08 <lambdabot> nand defined
15:04:34 <Marvin--> o3 :)
15:05:07 <shapr> ddarius: http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/~shae/darcs.tgz
15:06:01 <ddarius> cool
15:12:11 <shapr> hi TripleDES 
15:12:20 <shapr> asmodai: hey man, you tried any Haskell yet?
15:13:07 <TripleDES> n8 shapr 
15:13:09 <TripleDES> :)
15:13:17 * shapr boings
15:13:17 <TripleDES> hi _
15:13:22 <shapr> heh
15:13:31 <raver> y0!
15:13:35 <shapr> y0 y0
15:13:42 <raver> :)
15:13:57 <shapr> so, you guys know each other or something? ;-)
15:14:30 <TripleDES> hahaha
15:15:31 <TripleDES> no, we have our rooms with 2m between but I don't who's raver ...heh
15:15:52 <raver> I don't know... who are you TripleDES? :P
15:16:09 <TripleDES> Do you
15:16:10 <TripleDES> Do you
15:16:11 <TripleDES> Do you
15:16:11 <TripleDES> Do you
15:16:19 <TripleDES> wow
15:16:28 <TripleDES> hard day studying
15:16:37 <raver> yes
15:17:42 <Marvin--> TripleDES: "neight"?
15:17:50 * Marvin-- will never understand this leet speak thingy
15:18:35 <shapr> mmm, my new unicycle tire -> http://www.nokiantyres.com/bike/images/ragahit.jpg
15:18:39 <TripleDES> what's neight ?
15:19:36 <TripleDES> shapr: cool!
15:19:38 <TripleDES> :)
15:19:45 <raver> shapr nice one
15:19:56 <shapr> yah, I can barely wait till tomorrow to try it out.
15:20:12 <ddarius> Marvin--: I don't see how it ever started...
15:20:20 <raver> yeah maybe now it's quite late
15:20:29 <raver> ups
15:20:36 <raver> at least in UK..
15:20:38 <raver> :)
15:20:48 <andersca> http://img.4chan.net/b/src/1069688901332.gif
15:21:13 <ddarius> So, gonna go mountain unicycling shapr?
15:21:27 <shapr> heck yeah
15:21:40 <andersca> wonder what the best way to write that in haskell would be
15:21:41 <shapr> I haven't tried muni before, but I will now.
15:21:47 * ddarius wonders if there is eXtreme unicycling... probably.
15:21:47 <TripleDES> Marvin--: sorry, I don't know what do you mean...:(
15:22:18 <TripleDES> shapr: how's lambdabot ?
15:22:21 <ddarius> [18:11] <TripleDES> n8 shapr
15:22:37 <TripleDES> n8 is leet ?
15:22:41 <raver> wow shapr it seems not an easy job...
15:22:42 <TripleDES> sorry about then
15:22:46 <TripleDES> :\
15:22:47 <raver> b careful
15:22:51 <raver> ;-)
15:23:05 <shapr> andersca: what about [ w,x,y,z | w <- [0..255], x <- [0..255], y <- [0..255], z <- [0..255]]
15:23:20 <shapr> raver: er, what's not an easy job?
15:23:30 <shapr> TripleDES: lambdabot is doing well. the operation was a success.
15:23:31 <ddarius> shapr: Doing python recently?
15:23:39 <raver> unicycling
15:23:39 <andersca> shapr: yeah, wondering if there was a nicer wya
15:23:40 <andersca> way
15:23:40 <TripleDES> shapr: :)
15:23:51 <shapr> ddarius: yes, lots, does it show?
15:24:05 <raver> municycling
15:24:07 <raver> sorry
15:24:10 <ddarius> w,x,y,z as opposed to (w,x,y,z)
15:24:12 <shapr> raver: oh, it's not so bad.
15:24:16 <shapr> ddarius: doh
15:24:37 <shapr> raver: unless you're doing trials
15:24:47 <shapr> in which case muni can be extremely difficult
15:25:02 <raver> i see
15:25:08 <raver> i like mountain bike
15:25:23 <raver> and trials are the hardest ways
15:25:25 <Marvin--> andersca: old news ;) but I love it :)
15:25:32 <TripleDES> I prefer chair bike
15:25:33 <TripleDES> :P
15:26:08 <raver> TripleDES :)
15:26:16 <ddarius> andersca: sequence (replicate 4 [1..255])
15:26:43 <shapr> ooh that's hard to beat
15:26:56 <shapr> I keep forgetting about the List monad
15:27:22 <Marvin--> ddarius: ooh, that's evil :-)
15:27:59 <Marvin--> actually, it's extraordinarily evil
15:28:16 <andersca> haha
15:28:29 <Marvin--> why don't we have general monad comprehensions?
15:28:43 <shapr> didn't that exist at some point?
15:28:50 <shapr> I've seen discussions go across the lists about that.
15:28:51 <andersca> might want to apply (,,,) too
15:28:52 <Marvin--> I have a faint memory of something like it
15:29:29 <Marvin--> andersca: why? you want strings in a file in the end anyway...
15:29:38 <andersca> hmm, perhaps
15:30:14 <Marvin--> depends on how you define the problem, of course :)
15:30:21 <Marvin--> andersca: QUICK, it's TUESDAY, order the t-shirts!
15:30:33 <shapr> yes! order me one too!
15:31:09 <andersca> http://www.cafeshops.com/freedesktop.8658420
15:31:54 <ddarius> unlines $ map (concat . intersperse "." . map show) $ sequence $ replicate 4 [1..255]
15:32:12 <shapr> raver: is it standard practice to ride across stuff like fallen logs during mountain bike trials?
15:32:12 <Marvin--> ddarius: yeah yeah, stop showing off now ;)
15:32:26 <shapr> heh, that's cute.
15:32:46 <shapr> ya know, this might be a fun wiki feature
15:33:00 <ddarius> Generating ip addresses?
15:33:12 <shapr> like the 10 PRINT "HELLO" 20 GOTO 10 thing that Marvin-- started way back when
15:33:22 <shapr> nah, smallest solution for a given small task
15:33:26 <Marvin--> hey, don't blame me
15:33:29 <Marvin--> did I start it?
15:33:33 * Marvin-- has no recollection of that :)
15:33:36 <shapr> yes, you started it
15:33:39 <shapr> I have logs to prove it!
15:33:52 <shapr> actually, I remember either you or I started it...
15:33:58 <Marvin--> cool, I didn't know I was that geeky^Wcool ;)
15:33:59 * shapr really isn't sure
15:34:03 <shapr> heh!
15:34:23 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/SillySignatures
15:35:22 <shapr> that was lots of fun, many people sent me email with various versions
15:35:42 <shapr> it was sort of like Fritz's "Evolution of A Haskell Programmer"
15:36:03 <Marvin--> yeah
15:36:10 * Marvin-- sighs
15:36:19 * Marvin-- wishes it was still last Saturday so he could go see Cats again
15:36:50 <shapr> what's another small task we could try?
15:38:27 <Marvin--> I'm going to apply myself to the task of going to bed :)
15:38:36 <ddarius> hmm, if Marvin-- wants more abusive usage, use a personal favorite of mine, mconcat . intersperse ('.':) . map shows
15:38:37 <shapr> that's probably a good idea for me too
15:38:53 <shapr> ddarius: and you got a smiley in there too. impressive.
15:38:59 <Marvin--> ddarius: stoooop iiiit
15:39:05 <Marvin--> let the madness end!
15:39:28 <ddarius> I actually use mconcat like that.
15:41:15 <Marvin--> grrr
15:41:26 <Marvin--> metacity crashes occasionally when I quit a program
15:41:37 <shapr> use a different wm
15:41:50 <shapr> like my favorite, ion!
15:42:07 <Marvin--> oh, being a wm it's restarted immediately of course, but it's semi-annoying
15:42:18 <Marvin--> I like gnome too much to switch to something else
15:43:41 <Cale> I think you can use gnome with other wms.
15:43:49 <Flarelocke> yeah
15:44:48 <Flarelocke> it's a gconf setting
15:45:08 <andersca> Marvin--: I think that's been fixed in CVS now
15:45:22 <Flarelocke> it's /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/default
15:45:28 <shapr> imho, gnome was meant to used with sawfish 
15:45:36 <andersca> shapr: that was a long time ago
15:45:45 <shapr> I still like sawfish.
15:46:00 <shapr> admittedly, I haven't used metacity recently
15:46:06 <shapr> it didn't do anything last time I tried it.
15:47:03 * shapr adds that to his list of things to try
15:48:35 <Marvin--> andersca: goody
15:48:51 <Marvin--> shapr: it still does nothing, but it does it well
15:49:08 <shapr> in that case, I'll stick with ion
15:50:08 <Cale> I still use enlightenment.
15:50:35 <shapr> I'm a minimalist.
15:51:28 <TripleDES> openbox rules :)
15:51:44 <Cale> I use pwm at school. It's sort of neat. Couldn't get used to ion though.
15:52:15 <Marvin--> well, I'm off
15:52:15 <Marvin--> night
15:53:32 <shapr> I don't like using the mouse if I can stay away from it
15:54:48 <TripleDES> keyboard is more useful, even more in laptops
15:55:37 <shapr> have you tried a kinesis keyboard?
15:55:58 <TripleDES> no, what's that ?
15:56:55 <shapr> http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/500-blk.jpg
15:57:20 <shapr> though my two are only in white http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/images/133-sml.jpg
15:57:29 <TripleDES> wow!!!
15:57:36 <TripleDES> cool
15:57:51 <shapr> sex|more: miranda?
15:57:53 <TripleDES> I use a natural keyboard on my workstation
15:58:31 <shapr> if you get a chance to try the kinesis, I think it's worth the price.
15:59:19 <TripleDES> I have another thing to write on my wishlist
15:59:21 <TripleDES> ;)
16:00:50 <TripleDES> shapr: you don't have to show things like that to mee
16:00:54 <TripleDES> :D
16:01:33 <TripleDES> Im a compulsive buyer (only PC's)
16:01:36 <TripleDES> hehe
16:02:47 <shapr> heh
16:03:13 <shapr> my first kinesis was killed in an unfortunate coding accident.
16:03:26 <TripleDES> heheh
16:03:55 <shapr> now that I've quit writing Java code, my new kinesis is safe.
16:04:25 <raver> shapr sure
16:04:28 <raver> Java sux!
16:04:57 <shapr> raver: hey, do you use tree stumps, fallen logs, and four foot rocks in mountain bike trials?
16:05:00 <raver> sorry but I am having a very bad experience with my web coursework
16:05:29 <shapr> what about stairway railings? ;-)
16:06:06 <raver> mmm..
16:06:12 <raver> not too much
16:06:19 <shapr> raver: I've done Java professionally.
16:06:22 <shapr> and survived!
16:06:29 <raver> buff
16:06:35 <raver> you are a survivor
16:06:50 <raver> in your profession
16:06:54 <raver> and your hobbies
16:06:55 <shapr> I even quit smoking while I had that job. My coworkers hated me.
16:07:19 <TripleDES> raver is too strong, he got a bag with iron when he is in a mountain bike trial
16:07:28 <shapr> a bag with iron?
16:07:29 <TripleDES> :P
16:08:15 <shapr> there's a lot of muni people in the UK
16:08:24 <raver> just to do fast down-hills TripleDES
16:08:46 <TripleDES> heh
16:08:47 <raver> shapr but there aren't many mountains here
16:08:56 <raver> maybe in scotland...
16:09:17 <shapr> which part of the UK do you live in?
16:09:28 <raver> Leicester
16:09:42 * shapr gets a map
16:09:47 <raver> :)
16:10:02 <raver> midland
16:10:34 <shapr> ah
16:10:57 <raver> near nottingham and birmingham
16:11:17 <shapr> I used to live in Birmingham.
16:11:19 <shapr> the other one
16:11:33 <shapr> hey, Leicester has Ben Nevis
16:11:34 <Riastradh> The one in MA?
16:11:50 <shapr> er, no..
16:12:01 <Riastradh> Birmingham must be a very overloaded name.
16:12:23 * shapr finds the leicester web site
16:12:29 <raver> lol
16:12:31 <ddarius> the other other one
16:12:41 <raver> ddarius hahaha
16:13:02 <shapr> wow, leicester city website.. in chinese.
16:13:41 <raver> maybe it's also in panjab
16:13:52 <shapr> it is
16:14:10 <raver> it's an indian city
16:14:14 <TripleDES> yeah
16:14:18 <ddarius> wow, second generation chinese in UK, there pronunciation must be quite interesting to an American.
16:14:48 <TripleDES> I think there are more Indian guys than English in Leicester
16:15:07 <shapr> sex|more: so, what do you think of Miranda-IM?
16:15:25 <sex|more> ??
16:15:30 <sex|more> did I post something about it?
16:15:38 <shapr> you were just using it, right?
16:15:46 <sex|more> ah ok!
16:15:51 <sex|more> I am using it for 2 years
16:15:55 <sex|more> think so
16:15:57 <sex|more> I love it
16:16:10 <sex|more> don't want to live w7o
16:16:12 <sex|more> W/o
16:16:24 <shapr> sex|more: you have a german keyboard?
16:16:26 <sex|more> but IRC proto isn't that goog
16:16:31 <sex|more> yes
16:16:34 <sex|more> good**
16:16:36 <shapr> ah
16:16:39 <sex|more> why?
16:16:43 <sex|more> because of the 7
16:16:47 <shapr> shift 7 is & on my keyboard
16:16:48 <shapr> yup
16:16:56 <sex|more> :d
16:17:14 <sex|more> do you use miranda too?
16:17:16 <shapr> bonjour Vincenz, ltns
16:17:26 <shapr> sex|more: no, I use emacs.
16:17:34 <sex|more> ??
16:17:40 <shapr> emacs is my irc client.
16:17:40 <sex|more> what has miranda to do with emacs?
16:17:49 <sex|more> really? this is possible?
16:17:53 <shapr> sure
16:17:59 <sex|more> I mean for instant messaging
16:18:04 <shapr> yes
16:18:16 <sex|more> have ICQ and MSN in it too?
16:18:22 <shapr> many people on #emacs use bitlbee for that
16:18:38 <Vincenz> Hello shapr
16:18:43 * Vincenz grumbles at a c problem
16:18:48 <shapr> Vincenz: how's code treating you?
16:18:58 <shapr> Vincenz: have you gotten around to learning Haskell?
16:18:59 <Vincenz> Not so good, trying to compile something with msvc but it requires dirent
16:19:03 <Vincenz> No not yet
16:19:12 <shapr> one day soon maybe?
16:19:21 <Vincenz> I'm afraid not soon
16:19:24 <shapr> aww
16:19:35 <sex|more> well, this is my miranda: http://picserv.beyond-reality.nl/getpicture.php?id=394387&check=5aec17
16:19:36 <TripleDES> I use bitlbee
16:19:39 <TripleDES> :)
16:19:51 <sex|more> and this is my other thought on linux: http://picserv.beyond-reality.nl/getpicture.php?id=372392&check=5aec17
16:20:11 <shapr> heh
16:20:20 <sex|more> frist or second?
16:20:47 <shapr> I dislike closed source software, but I'm not so picky about which open source software people use.
16:21:16 <sex|more> well, OSS isn't always good
16:22:08 <shapr> really?
16:23:22 <sex|more> well, miranda or emule are excellent OSS
16:23:27 <sex|more> but I really dislike KDE
16:23:37 <sex|more> it's slow, sometimes buggy and ugly :d
16:23:42 <sex|more> KDE takes too long to start
16:23:52 <sex|more> unusable <600 MHz
16:23:57 <sex|more> KDE 3.x
16:24:06 <sex|more> whe had some sun terminals
16:24:10 <sex|more> and KDE 3.1
16:24:11 <TripleDES> it's useful for my mum :P
16:24:13 <sex|more> overkill
16:24:36 <shapr> sex|more: you could fix it.
16:24:44 <TripleDES> she can talk with me using a jabber client, on a netbsd without any windows
16:25:15 <sex|more> shapr: I can fix it?
16:25:19 <sex|more> what do you man?
16:25:21 <sex|more> mean
16:25:21 <shapr> yes. you can fix it.
16:25:29 <shapr> that's the point of OSS software. Don't whine, fix it.
16:25:30 <shapr> ;-)
16:25:51 <sex|more> ah ok!
16:26:00 <sex|more> no, dislike the idea of KDE
16:26:04 <sex|more> I like www.xpde.com
16:26:06 <shapr> what about gnome?
16:26:15 * Vincenz heads to sleep.
16:26:16 <sex|more> I like www.xpde.org
16:26:20 <Vincenz> quit
16:26:43 <sex|more> http://www.xpde.com/
16:26:44 <shapr> sex|more: doesn't seem to exist
16:26:54 <sex|more> gnome is quite fine and not that slow
16:27:18 <sex|more> woorks now
16:27:19 <sex|more> gnome is quite fine and not that slow
16:27:21 <sex|more> http://www.xpde.com/
16:27:27 <ddarius> shapr: earlier is where you point at Marvin--'s QuotesPage entry
16:27:34 * ozone bites his tongue
16:27:34 <shapr> ddarius: yes?
16:27:36 <ozone> morning
16:27:43 * shapr bites ozone's ankle
16:27:54 <shapr> g'day
16:28:39 <ozone> g'day
16:28:49 <shapr> how's mocka?
16:28:53 <shapr> er, mocha?
16:28:58 <shapr> which spelling is correct?
16:30:02 <shapr> sex|more: I like the ion window manager.
16:30:12 <sex|more> link=?
16:30:14 <shapr> ddarius: what about earlier?
16:30:32 <shapr> sex|more: http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/
16:31:12 <ddarius> when you said "you could fix it".  My sentence wasn't very coherent.
16:31:54 <sex|more> shapr: well, quite black
16:32:02 <sex|more> someone familiar with TeX?
16:32:16 <shapr> ion is very usable, imho
16:32:25 <sex|more> I like Auqa
16:32:30 <sex|more> best unix GUI
16:35:31 <Cale> for some reason I can't stand aqua
16:35:58 <sex|more> why?
16:36:15 <sex|more> forsome reason I hate the total CLI dependency on linux
16:36:30 <shapr> I think mice suck.
16:36:49 <sex|more> and chicks? :-D
16:36:59 <Cale> I hate the lack of cli usability on other systems :)
16:37:03 <shapr> yah, me too
16:37:15 <shapr> I can write a spell checker in a very small line of shell script
16:37:23 <shapr> show me how to do that with a mouse...
16:37:43 <sex|more> I never had the urge to do so
16:38:10 <Cale> I like using mice for what they're good at, and sometimes I even think that two-graphical-input-device systems might be good, but there are things that the CLI is really good at.
16:38:27 <Cale> The CLI is far more expressive than the mouse.
16:38:29 <shapr> sex|more: if you choose to spell check a language for which a spell checker does not exist, it's the fastest way to do it.
16:39:07 <shapr> the commandline tools available in unix are very useful 
16:39:46 <sex|more> in unix yes, because the GUIs are pretty bad
16:39:57 <shapr> no, I've used them in windows
16:40:03 <shapr> and they were just as useful there.
16:40:06 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym 
16:40:07 <Pseudonym> G'day all.
16:40:08 <sex|more> cygwin?
16:40:11 <ozone> must ... bite ... tongue ...
16:40:19 <Cale> I find that when I use windows, I'm always frustrated by the lack of ability to do many things.
16:40:19 <shapr> ozone: say it!
16:40:21 <Pseudonym> Mmm... tongue.
16:40:28 <shapr> hiya exarkun 
16:40:35 <ozone> Pseudonym: you sick puppy :)
16:40:53 <Cale> and the lack of connectivity. I can't just load up an X program over the network, for example.
16:41:04 <sex|more> someone of u ever used CDE?
16:41:07 <exarkun> hallo
16:41:09 <shapr> sex|more: seriously, if you learn the basic tools like comm,uniq,tr,etc they'll come in really handy.
16:41:29 <shapr> CDE was Sun's bid for the desktop wasn't it?
16:41:38 <sex|more> yes
16:41:44 * exarkun used that at NIH
16:41:46 <shapr> I think I used that on SunOS and Solaris 
16:42:00 <sex|more> were you lucky with?
16:42:09 <exarkun> it wasn't anything special
16:42:13 <sex|more> http://tinyurl.com/wen8
16:42:15 <shapr> exarkun: were you there as a patient? ;-)
16:42:18 <exarkun> shapr: heh
16:42:21 <sex|more> It was about to puke
16:42:24 <exarkun> you *could* say that..
16:42:30 <sex|more> we had to use it
16:43:39 <shapr> shell scripting is very useful.
16:43:53 <sex|more> for admins
16:43:54 <shapr> and graphical replacements wouldn't be useful.
16:43:55 <Cale> right, that's in 4 more years or so. I have a usable desktop environment now.
16:44:19 <shapr> sex|more: at this stage in computers, every user needs to be an admin.
16:44:49 <sex|more> don't think so
16:44:49 <shapr> Good Evening Agent Jones.
16:45:04 <sex|more> my sister has never seen cli and won't never see
16:45:19 <shapr> sure, and you fix the problems on her computer, right?
16:46:06 <shapr> every computer system I've seen really does need a clueful human admin
16:46:29 <shapr> or an end user who is willing to reinstall the system on a regular basis, but that may count as admin activity also.
16:46:44 <shapr> bonjour _rubix 
16:46:57 <sex|more> yes, I do
16:47:00 <sex|more> she uses it
16:47:05 <shapr> sex|more: well, it's a fun argument anyway :-)
16:47:09 <_rubix> bonjour shapr
16:47:19 <shapr> _rubix: comment Ã§a va?
16:47:27 <Pseudonym> I suppose that a computer system suitably insulated could do without an admin.
16:47:43 <shapr> Pseudonym: windows runs fine until you install programs on it ;-)
16:47:43 <Pseudonym> The thing is, they say that you don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car.
16:47:52 <Pseudonym> That wasn't true in 1912.
16:48:02 <Pseudonym> You had to be a fairly good mechanic back then.
16:48:29 <_rubix> shapr, ça va bien, j'essaye toujours d'apprendre le haskell, mais je n'ai pas beaucoup de temps à y consacrer
16:48:34 <shapr> yah, men were under bonnets more than women then ;-)
16:48:43 <Pseudonym> Oooh, you said "bonnet".
16:48:46 <shapr> quelle dommage!
16:48:48 <Pseudonym> Not "hood".
16:49:02 <shapr> Pseudonym: in deference to your cultural upbringing
16:49:09 <Pseudonym> Thanks. :-)
16:49:17 <Pseudonym> My wife is American.  I understand both.
16:49:31 <shapr> in that case, it was just a chance for a lame bonnet pun.
16:49:42 <Pseudonym> I also understand both "light bulb" and "light globe".
16:49:54 <shapr> never heard the second one
16:50:12 <Pseudonym> I would have thought that bonnets were fairly impractical in Edwardian-era cars.
16:50:13 <ozone> i always like the "trash" -> "garbage"/"rubbish" localisation, myself
16:50:29 <shapr> _rubix: veux tu d'apprendre un peu maintenant?
16:50:34 <_rubix> shapr, sais-tu s'il existe un outil qui peut transformer un programme haskell et qualifier tous les "import" ? (je ne sais pas si je suis compréhensible)
16:50:50 <_rubix> shapr, pourquoi pas
16:50:56 <shapr> bien :-)
16:51:16 <shapr> though I may fall over asleep soon.
16:51:22 <Pseudonym> I know exactly two French jokes.
16:51:29 <shapr> oh, I want to hear them.
16:51:47 <_rubix> je suis en train de regarder un peu OpenGL en haskell
16:51:59 <shapr> chouette!
16:52:05 * shapr likes that word
16:52:11 <Pseudonym> One is Duchamp's Mona Lisa with the moustache, which he entitled "LHOOQ".
16:52:29 <Pseudonym> You have to say it aloud.
16:52:45 <shapr> luc?
16:52:56 <Pseudonym> The other I made up myself.  We were naming the Mercury debugger, and I suggested we call it MerDe.
16:52:57 <_rubix> "elle a chaud au cul"
16:53:40 <_rubix> Pseudonym, did you really choose that name ?
16:53:43 <sex|more> merde, sounds nice
16:53:49 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
16:53:55 <Pseudonym> We didn't use it, though.
16:54:10 <shapr> _rubix: peut-etre emacs? M-x replace-regexp ^ ^Graphics.OpenGL
16:54:11 <_rubix> there is also "emerde", for gentoo users :)
16:54:14 * Pseudonym has a filthy mouth in several languages
16:54:15 * shapr grins
16:54:37 <Pseudonym> Actually speaking the language conventionally, not so much.
16:54:54 <sex|more> 4MerDe
16:54:56 <_rubix> shapr, this does not seem useful...
16:54:57 <sex|more> ist great
16:55:11 <shapr> _rubix: you want to add a qualifier at the front of all the imports, yes?
16:55:37 <shapr> _rubix: do you use emacs?
16:55:48 <shapr> utiliser tu emacs?
16:55:59 <_rubix> shapr, I want to change all "import" into "import qualified" and the resulting program must still compile
16:56:00 <shapr> I might as well practice before going to Lille
16:56:06 <_rubix> oui pour emacs
16:56:07 <shapr> ohh
16:56:20 <Pseudonym> We had a guy from Brittany working with the Mercury group at the time.
16:56:33 <shapr> maybe M-x replace-string<enter> import<enter> import qualified<enter> ?
16:56:38 <Pseudonym> His name was Erwan, and he signed all his emails "R1".  So I suppose that's a thid joke, of sorts.
16:56:42 <shapr> heh
16:56:45 <shapr> that's cute.
16:56:46 <_rubix> yes, but all the uses of external names must be recognized and prefixed
16:56:52 <shapr> ohh!
16:57:02 <shapr> dude, you need a refactoring browser.
16:57:16 <_rubix> that's it !
16:57:16 <TripleDES> well...time to dream
16:57:19 <shapr> One exists for Haskell, but I don't know if it has that feature.
16:57:25 <_rubix> maybe a modification of ghc would do
16:57:34 <TripleDES> seeya

16:58:54 <Pseudonym> Night.
16:58:58 <shapr> oh, maybe you could use a pretty printer.
16:59:00 <Pseudonym> (Late.)
16:59:22 <rubix> shapr, thanks, I'll take a look
16:59:25 <shapr> ok
16:59:45 <shapr> I'm going to sleep also. I have Swedish Tax System class at 9am.
16:59:52 <rubix> I intend to use it mainly for understanding other's code

17:00:07 <sex|more> good night

17:22:59 <det> shapr, you are a student ?
17:29:35 <Pseudonym> det: He's gone, but no he's not.
17:39:44 <SyntaxLaptop> is there a way to parse just a piece of haskell syntax with Language.Haskell.Parser or something?
17:39:53 <SyntaxLaptop> I want to just parse records w/ field labels
17:42:47 <sparkersi> can you guys explain to me how ord works in the following quick sort code? i understand that ord takes in a char and returns its acsii value, but how does it work on a list of ints, each of which is greater than 9?
17:42:47 <sparkersi> quickSort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
17:42:48 <sparkersi> quickSort []     = []
17:42:48 <sparkersi> quickSort (p:xs) = quickSort [ x | x <- xs, x < p ]
17:42:48 <sparkersi>                    ++ p : quickSort [ x | x <- xs, p <= x ]
17:43:09 <ddarius> SyntaxLaptop: look at the source, if it doesn't export the functions, hack the source.
17:43:11 <Smerdyakov> ord isn't used there.
17:43:15 <Smerdyakov> Ord is, which is difference.
17:43:18 <Smerdyakov> different
17:43:32 <ddarius> SyntaxLaptop: I don't get it either.
17:43:38 <SyntaxLaptop> ddarius: that was my plan if its not exported anywhere
17:43:43 <sparkersi> Ord is a type class right?
17:43:46 <Smerdyakov> Yes.
17:44:01 <SyntaxLaptop> ddarius: sorry, what don't you get?
17:44:24 <ddarius> SyntaxLaptop: While only parseModule (is documented as) exported.
17:44:27 <SyntaxLaptop> sparkersi: that Ord thing is bascially saying that "the items that you're sorting need to be orderable" which is a pretty obvious restriction
17:44:32 <ddarius> While = Why
17:44:51 <SyntaxLaptop> ddarius: right. I'll check it out. maybe I'll add some comments and get more stuff exported.
17:44:55 <SyntaxLaptop> is it parsec? 
17:45:19 <ddarius> I don't remember, I think not.
17:45:28 <SyntaxLaptop> ok...
17:45:28 <sparkersi> correct, just like the Comparable class in Java
17:45:46 <Smerdyakov> Comparable is an interface in Java, not a class.
17:45:57 <Smerdyakov> And "class" means different things in Haskell and Java.
17:45:59 <sparkersi> well, yes, you know what i meant
17:46:17 <SyntaxLaptop> sparkersi: basically, it just means that you have "<" and "<=" in this case
17:46:28 <sparkersi> ok
17:52:52 <sparkersi> also, ++ appends two lists together, and : adds an element to the front of a list, correct?
17:53:25 <SyntaxLaptop> sparkersi: yep
17:55:21 <SyntaxLaptop> its a happy grammar so I'll have to actually write code
17:58:05 * SyntaxLaptop considers just slapping "module Foo where\n" to the front of the string I want to parse
18:01:33 <Igloo> That shouldn't be necessary, surely?
18:02:19 <SyntaxLaptop> well, think about it; as far as I know, there's no way to tell happy that I want a variety of start symbols, and to give functions that parse these symbols particular names
18:02:48 <SyntaxLaptop> I could make my own start symbol which parses module | whatever | whatever, but I'd have to change the type of the parse function
18:03:14 <SyntaxLaptop> so I could do that, then leave parseModule as a wrapper that causes an error if it's any start symbol beside module
18:03:14 * Igloo gets confused and goes to look at the report
18:03:26 <SyntaxLaptop> 'eh?
18:04:12 <Igloo> See 9.5 in http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/syntax-iso.html - the "module modid [exports] where" is optional
18:05:07 <SyntaxLaptop> oh, so you mean "where" is unnecessary?
18:05:30 <SyntaxLaptop> that doesn't really fix my fundamental complaint.
18:05:42 <Igloo> The whole "module Foo where\n" is unnecessary
18:06:09 <Igloo> Unless you really need it to be called Foo for some reason
18:06:35 <Igloo> It default to "module Main (main) where" if omitted (or maybe "module Main where", I'm not 100% sure)
18:06:57 <SyntaxLaptop> hm...
18:07:58 <SyntaxLaptop> no, I don't care what its called.
18:15:25 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah, appending "foo = " will work it seems
18:16:31 <Igloo> prepending </personal thingummywhatsit>
18:16:52 <Igloo> Bah, what's the word for those things?
18:17:32 <SyntaxLaptop> tag? I don't know wat you mean
18:18:04 <Igloo> Ah, pet peeve
18:19:22 <SyntaxLaptop> ahhh. I see wtf yr talking about :)
18:19:38 <Igloo> :-)
18:29:58 <Riastradh> Igloo, he didn't specify where the 'to' was; he could have implied 'appending "foo = " _to_it_' _OR_ 'appending _it_to_ "foo = "', Mr Badly Pedantic.
18:31:24 <Smerdyakov> Robots are attacking.
18:31:28 <Riastradh> If you're going to be pedantic, you should at least be _right_.
18:31:34 <Riastradh> Like me.
18:31:57 <ayrnieu> Riastradh - I've always read 'appending X' as 'appending X to', but thank you for this glance into bizarro-world.  I shall keep such ambiguity in mind.
18:32:52 * Igloo doesn't agree with you, and I'm English so I win arguments on the English language automatically. Anyway, bed time - g'night all  :-)
18:32:59 <Smerdyakov> I don't like when people talk about "appending two lists."
18:33:09 <Smerdyakov> "Concatenate" is much more clear.
18:34:10 <ayrnieu> smerd - obviously those people speak of the situation where they append two lists onto something else -- possibly a list of lists.
18:34:21 <Smerdyakov> <sparkersi> also, ++ appends two lists together, and : adds an element to the front of a list, correct?
18:34:41 <Riastradh> (++) is pronounced 'append.'  'concat' is different, Smerdyakov.
18:34:55 <Smerdyakov> And TALx86 has a type constructor append that concatenates two stack types.
18:35:06 <ayrnieu> smerd - sparkersi said 'append two lists together', not 'append two lists'
18:35:14 * Riastradh bahs at you silly x86 folk.
18:35:20 <Smerdyakov> "Append together" is a grammar mismatch in my mind.
18:35:50 <ayrnieu> smerd - it suggests the situation where many lists get appended onto a base-list.
18:43:58 * SyntaxLaptop appends Smerdyakov
18:44:02 <SyntaxLaptop> (together)
18:45:16 * Riastradh appends SyntaxLaptop to Smerdyakov and results in SyntaxLaptopSmerdyakov, a big camel consisting of a laptop reading the Brothers Karamazov or however it's spelled.
18:47:35 * Pseudonym concatenates #haskell and ends up with a very large user name
18:53:37 <mgoetze> hello SyntaxLaptop 
18:53:38 <Benji2> hi
18:55:10 <mgoetze> SyntaxLaptop: would you like to play a game of go? :)
18:56:12 <Benji2> well, bye
18:57:35 <SyntaxLaptop> mgoetze: no, I'm going to get kicked out o fhtis coffee shop soon, then off to a pub :)
18:57:46 <SyntaxLaptop> mgoetze: but we should play sometime.
18:58:49 <SyntaxLaptop> mgoetze: white has a half point advantage, right? (in an even game)
18:59:02 <SyntaxLaptop> so there are no ties? I beat a guy by one point this weekend.
18:59:05 <SyntaxLaptop> (in a 9x9)
18:59:09 <SyntaxLaptop> but I was black.
18:59:37 <rubix> white has a komi of about 6.5 in 19x19
19:00:04 <SyntaxLaptop> whoa
19:00:17 <SyntaxLaptop> so on a 9x9 should it be more or less? :)
19:00:21 <mgoetze> SyntaxLaptop: uhm
19:00:48 <mgoetze> SyntaxLaptop: i don't know what's wrong with ties :) but in an even game, white usually recieves compensation
19:01:11 <rubix> I don't really know, it depends of the average difference in score between professional players in 9x9 :)
19:01:30 <mgoetze> the problem is, professional plays don't play 9x9 very often :)
19:01:43 <mgoetze> but i think taking the same as for 19x19 works more or less
19:01:56 <mgoetze> (i.e. 7 points according to my preferred ruleset)
19:02:16 <SyntaxLaptop> ok, so if I beat him by one point, and I was black, he probably won
19:02:28 <SyntaxLaptop> nothing's wrong w/ ties. we agreed it was a tie in fact
19:02:50 <mgoetze> well, normally, one would agree about the komi before the game ;)
19:03:25 <SyntaxLaptop> mgoetze: good idea :)
19:03:45 <SyntaxLaptop> hopefully, he won't think of this, because he's a math major, and he would probably talk about it forever :)
19:04:50 <SyntaxLaptop> so what do you think is a good first move on 9x9? I was thinking 4,4
19:05:17 <rubix> in order to find the Right value for 9x9, you just have to brute force all possible games and find the score with best play :)
19:05:41 <mgoetze> i think 4-4 is about the worst possible opening move short of playing on the first or second line ;)
19:05:44 <SyntaxLaptop> rubix: I'll just take the head of a lazy list of such!
19:05:45 <rubix> (5,5) can be fine also in 9x9
19:05:47 <mgoetze> personally i prefer 3-4
19:05:56 <SyntaxLaptop> what's so bad about 4,4?
19:06:12 <SyntaxLaptop> it seems to grab a lot of area and still be anchored to the corner
19:06:16 <SyntaxLaptop> 5x5 feels like the middle to me :)
19:06:37 <rubix> SyntaxLaptop, it is, that's the point :)
19:06:51 <mgoetze> well that's a common misconception novices have about 4-4... it doesn't actually grab any territory :)
19:07:04 <ayrnieu> syntax - why does 5,5 feel any more like the middle than 4,4?
19:07:31 <ayrnieu> also, nevermind.
19:07:59 <mgoetze> while in a 19x19 game i would be very happy if my opponent invades my 4-4 point at 3-3, in a 9x9 game, the nice outside influence i gain isn't really worth much...
19:08:47 * SyntaxLaptop shrugs the shrug of a novice :)
19:15:41 <Pseudonym> You sunk my battleship!
19:17:16 <emu> it looks close to 4,4 but it changes a lot of things
19:17:28 <emu> huge difference between 3,4 and 4,4 too
19:22:38 <Cale> I like 5,5 on 9x9.
19:23:27 <mgoetze> lots of people do... i win against most of them ;)
19:23:56 <Cale> it's a nice move to fight with, which is what 9x9 is all about :)
19:23:58 <SyntaxLaptop> mgoetze: what's yr killer first move?
19:24:33 * ayrnieu remembers cheating in Battleship, by keeping a record of where the enemy had attacked and never letting a ship get hit until he couldn't've possibly placed it elsewhere.
19:24:55 <mgoetze> 03:05 < mgoetze> personally i prefer 3-4
19:25:19 <mgoetze> (on 9x9 that is... on 19x19 i have a variety of fuseki i play)
19:25:37 <Cale> Personally, I think that anything with both coordinates >= 3 is fine on 9x9.
19:25:56 <mgoetze> Cale: like 8-8? :)
19:25:57 <SyntaxLaptop> I think you two should definitely play a 9x9 game. I wish I could stick around for it :)
19:26:09 <Cale> heh
19:26:14 <rubix> Cale, agreed
19:26:16 <mgoetze> which two? me and Cale?
19:26:20 <SyntaxLaptop> ja
19:26:28 <SyntaxLaptop> to prove who has the better approach :)
19:26:30 <emu> i play around the center on a 9x9
19:26:41 <mgoetze> Cale, do you kgs?
19:26:48 <Cale> sure
19:26:57 <Cale> Haven't played in quite some time though.
19:27:05 <Cale> I'll log in
19:27:10 <mgoetze> ok :)
19:27:12 <Cale> (I'm Vx there)
19:28:02 <Cale> ah, 4k - you're likely somewhat better than me
19:28:21 <mgoetze> looks almost like english room is the only one you're in :)
19:28:59 <mgoetze> why don't you come over to, say, the mathematics room
19:29:06 <mgoetze> that one could use more activity
19:29:19 <Cale> windows/rooms is broken, it seems
19:29:33 <mgoetze> broken? eh?
19:29:45 <mgoetze> old client version?
19:29:45 <Cale> yes, it does nothing
19:29:59 <Cale> I'm using jws
19:30:20 <mgoetze> hm... well, i'll open up a game in english room then
19:30:45 <mgoetze> there ya go
19:34:38 <emu> kill kill
19:35:03 <Riastradh> Kill kill hate hate murder murder mutilate!
19:35:27 <emu> seki seki ko ko atari
19:35:44 <Riastradh> What's that supposed to mean?
19:38:55 <Smerdyakov> It means it's time for mud wrestling.
19:53:04 <Pseudonym> That would be an interesting addition to go, I think.
20:00:01 <Smerdyakov> You are wrong.
20:00:39 <Pseudonym> How do you know until you've tried it?
20:01:00 <Pseudonym> Or have you?
20:04:12 <Smerdyakov> I'm a Class 8 Know It All.
20:07:31 <emu> who outranks you
20:08:45 <Riastradh> esap.
20:09:02 <Pseudonym> Ah, but I have a Know It All handicap.
20:09:21 <Pseudonym> I get a four factoid advantage.
20:09:55 <Riastradh> Although esap doesn't count if you consider the fact that he really doesn't understand that complicated mathematical lingo that he spouts all the time.
20:16:01 <Pseudonym> To paraphrase hdaume: Arrest that man!  He slanders maths!
20:17:13 <Smerdyakov> Watch this:
20:17:15 <Smerdyakov> Math math math
20:17:20 <Smerdyakov> Oh no! Where did the 's' go!
20:17:25 <Smerdyakov> The British will be very upset!
20:17:51 <Pseudonym> Arrest that man!  He invokes C header files!
20:24:41 <Smerdyakov> I don't get it.
20:24:52 <blackdog> radiohead reference?
20:25:37 <Smerdyakov> I don't recall any of the following words in that song: {invokes, C, header, files}
20:25:44 <Smerdyakov> Maybe "He" is a Radiohead reference?
20:26:56 <blackdog> they're very good at obscuring the true message of their songs. Jonny Greenwood's actually a perl hacker.
20:27:12 <Pseudonym> "Karma police" is a reference to slashdot.
20:27:59 <blackdog> "like spinning plates" is obviously about system administration
20:29:12 <Pseudonym> "You and whose army?" is clearly about spammers.
20:30:07 <blackdog> No, you're thinking of "knives out", I think.
20:30:25 <Pseudonym> Hmm... could be.  See, that's the thing.  Multiple levels of meaning.
20:30:28 <Pseudonym> All of them geeky.
21:09:47 * isomer is away: zozo
21:53:35 <blackdog> any emacs gurus around?
21:54:23 <Smerdyakov> No, but I am really useful.
21:55:03 <blackdog> i'm trying to work out how to make emacs compile my code and go to the first error immediately. the commands seem to be M-x compile and M-x next-error, but it doesn't work because it executes next-error before the compile is finished...
21:55:28 <blackdog> (spending half an hour to save half a second on each compile :)
21:55:31 <Smerdyakov> Hi. You are asking a Lisp question in #haskell. Now I'm going to put you in a box.
21:56:06 <blackdog> <small voice> does it help that I'm using it to compile haskell code? </>
21:56:38 <Smerdyakov> It might help outside the box.
21:56:50 <Smerdyakov> But the time for thinking outside the box has passed.
21:58:19 <blackdog> No Blackdog# constructors handy, then.
21:58:43 <Smerdyakov> That makes about as much sense as a Radiohead song about a pickle.
21:59:36 <blackdog> You're referring to "Vegetable", I assume? As every Radiohead connoisseur knows, it's obviously about gherkins...
21:59:49 <Smerdyakov> I'm referring to yer mum, mate.
22:00:45 <blackdog> Go home, Dad, you're drunk
22:01:04 <ozone> looks like my influence has spread worldwide
22:01:37 <Smerdyakov> That reminds me of that time my dad used a "your mom" joke with my brother and me.
22:14:35 <ddarius> I think ozone does have world-wide influence
22:15:35 <blackdog> <refrains from obvious joke about icebergs melting because he's heard it a million times before, right?>
