00:56:20 <lambdabot> Today, THREE WINOS from DETROIT sold me a framed photo of
00:56:20 <lambdabot>  TAB HUNTER before his MAKEOVER!
00:56:31 <shapr> hi haogal 
00:57:15 <haogal> shapr: Hello
01:01:15 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
01:01:59 <shapr> drlion: I actually natively think of all Haskell functions as taking one argument and returning a new argument, so I end up using partially applied functions lots.
01:03:55 <haogal> shapr, I'm considering learing haskell... right now I have my hands full with common lisp.  I just wanted to see what haskell people talk about. :-)
01:07:29 <shapr> well, if you do decide to learn Haskell, check out http://www.haskell.org/learning.html and http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
01:10:54 * earthy nods and concurs
01:11:02 <earthy> especially the latter is *very* useful
01:13:09 <shapr> yes, lots of good stuff on the Haskell Wiki
01:13:31 <haogal> Thanks... I've just bookmarked those pages.  I find the idea of a purely functional language perverse and disturbing, and therefore tantalizing.
01:13:58 <shapr> haogal: our perversion is your delight! (sounds like a spam subject to me)
01:18:53 <haogal> I'm a big fan of Friedman and Felleisen's _The Little Schemer_.  Is there an intro to haskell in a similar pedagogical vein?
01:19:13 <shapr> I haven't read that book, so I don't know.
01:19:23 <shapr> there are several books you can buy
01:19:36 <shapr> and there are at least two online tutorials you can read
01:19:54 <shapr> I've had the most fun trying stuff and asking questions here on this channel.
01:19:56 <haogal> The Little Schemer is quite unique among books I've seen.
01:20:29 <haogal> It's written as a dialog between the student and the interpreter.
01:20:49 <shapr> I would be willing to give you an interactive starting Haskell tutorial myself, and answer as many questions as I can after that.
01:20:58 <shapr> oh, I've heard of that one.
01:22:02 <shapr> they've mentioned it on LtU
01:23:16 <haogal> I often find, while reading the common lisp hyperspec for example, that I skip right to the examples.  The Little Schemer is all examples that build on each other.  It makes a worthless reference, but is a perfect tutorial.
01:24:21 <shapr> I like examples also
01:24:54 <shapr> here's something short I wrote: http://purl.org/net/shapr/src/haskell/Demo.hs
01:26:21 <shapr> haogal: is that file too dense?
01:27:16 <Lunar^> haogal: I will try to find it
01:30:50 <haogal> shapr, Not too dense.  It acually seems quite readable.
01:31:16 <haogal> ...from my outsider perspective of course.
01:33:24 <shapr> that's good to hear.
01:38:16 <ddarius> shapr: Why not make a MarshallToXML typeclass as an example?
01:38:35 <shapr> hm, interesting idea
01:40:45 <ddarius> Also, why not run it through a syntax highlighting (NOT using your colorscheme ;)
01:40:51 <shapr> aww :-)
01:40:52 * shapr laughs
01:42:19 * ddarius can just imagine Bea walking by: "Hey Shae did yo- Aagh! My eyes! My eyes!"
01:42:25 * shapr laughs
01:42:44 <shapr> truly, beatrice and I have different opinions on color schemes
01:47:01 <shapr> ddarius: I have an idea for a killer app for Haskell
01:47:07 <shapr> hopefully
01:48:54 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
01:48:58 * shapr writes up his idea
01:51:05 <Marvin--> ello
01:51:22 * Marvin-- swears
01:55:47 <Marvin--> this is not good, not good at all
01:56:12 <shapr> what's up?
01:57:02 <Marvin--> I found a bug in my program
01:57:14 <Marvin--> my nice results aren't as nice as I hoped
01:57:19 <shapr> oh, that sucks
01:57:43 <Marvin--> Eprover seems to have a hard time with the higher order functions
02:01:04 <Marvin--> especially partial application of higher order functions, ick
02:02:27 <Marvin--> grmbl, with the most evil function commented, it takes one minute instead of one second
02:02:37 <Marvin--> with the evil function, it doesn't seem to terminate ta all
02:02:47 <Marvin--> (well, not for the ten minutes I waited anyway=)
02:04:28 <Marvin--> (f @@ g) x = case g x of { Just y -> f y ; Nothing -> Nothing }  +  foldr (@@)  == evil
02:06:41 <Marvin--> er
02:06:51 <Marvin--> import Prelude ([](..))  doesn't work in ghc 6?
02:06:57 <Marvin--> it worked in ghc 5 :/
02:07:03 <shapr> what does it do?
02:07:13 <Marvin--> it should import the list type and its constructors
02:07:16 <Marvin--> but nothing else
02:07:32 <Marvin--> with ghci 6 I get "parse error on input `['"
02:07:48 <Marvin--> how the *bleep* am I supposed to import it otherwise?
02:07:57 <shapr> I dunno, Data.List ?
02:09:21 <Marvin--> GHC.List is probably more likely
02:09:50 <Marvin--> gah, ghc uses the alternatives system, but there's no /usr/bin/ghc5, the links point directly to /usr/lib/ghc...
02:10:05 <shapr> well, Igloo is the maintainer
02:10:19 <Marvin--> Igloooooo
02:10:19 <Marvin--> :)
02:11:07 <Marvin--> now, question is, should I send a mail to g-h-u about this?
02:17:21 <Marvin--> well, I did
02:27:29 <det> shapr, you and bea are no more, correct?
02:28:23 <shapr> huh?
02:28:25 <shapr> no, we're fine
02:28:33 <shapr> I'm going to go have lunch with her in a bit.
02:28:37 <shapr> det: why, interested? ;-)
02:29:22 <Marvin--> hrrm :)
02:29:30 <Marvin--> gah, my bug-reporting-fu sucks
02:29:49 <det> shapr: he mentioned her, I vagelu remember you parting ways ..
02:30:15 <shapr> he who?
02:31:06 <det> blah! nm!
02:31:31 <shapr> det: now you've got me curious...
02:31:54 <Marvin--> shapr: getting worried? ;-)
02:32:16 * det throws a cat at shapr
02:32:27 * shapr throws monkeys at det
02:34:41 <Marvin--> Igloo: when you get that stupid bug report of mine, just close it, I'm dumb
02:36:32 <det> shapr: so, back to your name, So what is the clever intersection of the greek pantheon with your name!? what does shae have to do with Eris's son? I must know!
02:50:51 * earthy thinks he sees Marvin-- and SimonPJ misunderstand eachother
02:51:50 <Marvin--> earthy: no kidding
02:52:43 <Marvin--> I mean, if I *don't* have  import Prelude([](..)) it won't find (:)
02:53:01 <earthy> err, but : is syntax.
02:53:06 <Marvin--> maybe I should've mentioned that I have -fno-implicit-prelude
02:53:06 <earthy> as SimonPJ states...
02:53:17 <earthy> maybe you should. :)
02:53:27 <Marvin--> hrm, in ghc 6 it is syntax, not in ghc 5
02:53:37 <Marvin--> so in ghc5 I *must* have the import, but in ghc6 I *cannot*
02:53:41 <earthy> euhm, yeah, right. :) ;)
02:53:41 <Marvin--> whoop-ee-doo
02:54:02 <earthy> and there is no preprocessor to select whether or not you want it. ;)
02:55:04 <earthy> but, shouldn't  import Prelude ( [](..) )   also import stuff like head, tail, length, (++) and such?
02:55:58 <earthy> I can't really see that being syntax. :)
02:56:56 <Marvin--> no, the (..) syntax means "import all the constructors"
02:57:06 <Marvin--> head, tail et.c. aren't constructors, just functions
02:57:26 <Marvin--> importing  Bool(..)  means importing the type Bool and the True, False constructors
02:57:26 <earthy> err... right.
02:57:39 <Marvin--> whereas just importing Bool means importing the type but not the constructors
02:57:46 <earthy> that makes 5.3.1 1. in the haskell 98 report even less clear.
02:57:56 <Marvin--> (of course, importing  Bool(True)  imports the type and the True constructor but not the False...)
02:58:06 <Marvin--> lemme dig up my Report
02:58:41 <earthy> `When the (..) form of import is used for a type of class, the (..) refers to all the constructors, methods, or field names exported from the module.
02:58:42 <earthy> '
02:59:00 <earthy> s/type of class/type or class/
02:59:30 <earthy> now, reading that or inclusively, that implies also importing head and tail and such
02:59:38 <earthy> reading it exclusively it still isn't clear
02:59:39 <Marvin--> well, constructors and field names refers to types and methods refers to classes
02:59:48 <Marvin--> it's badly phrased, I agree
02:59:59 <Marvin--> but head and tail aren't constructors, they aren't methods and they aren't field names
03:00:03 <Marvin--> they are functions. period.
03:00:10 <earthy> ah... right.
03:00:35 * earthy still prefers the rigor that was used for Algol68 when reading programming language specifications
03:01:39 <Marvin--> well, I said I agree that it's badly phrased :)
03:01:49 <earthy> yes, you did. :)
03:02:17 <earthy> but, given the exclusive reading you just suggested, the behavioural difference between ghc5 and 6 is *dumb*
03:02:29 <Marvin--> yes
03:02:35 <Marvin--> but it's probably ghc5 that's wrong
03:02:49 <earthy> owh, true.
03:03:19 <Marvin--> another difference seems to be that with ghc5 I don't have to explicitly import Monad to get return and >>=, but with ghc6 I do
03:03:20 <det> ehh
03:03:26 <det> what is the reasoning to make : syntax ?
03:03:31 <kosmikus|away> it also means that for example in ghc5 you could say (Prelude.:) to refer to the list constructor, in ghc6 that's wrong
03:03:40 <Marvin--> kosmikus: yah
03:03:56 <kosmikus> caused a very annoying bug in Generic Haskell
03:04:37 <Marvin--> oh?
03:05:43 <kosmikus> annoying because before that, I just could treat (:) like any other constructor, whereas now I have to explicitly treat it in a special way
03:06:00 <Marvin--> ah
03:06:09 <Marvin--> I thought you meant the other way around
03:06:29 <Marvin--> well, I'm off for lunch
03:06:35 <earthy> hm. lunch
03:06:51 <ddarius> Well since infix constructors can start with ':' it would be reasonable to have it be normal.
03:16:42 <earthy> but not according to spec...
04:13:14 <shapr> @yow
04:13:14 <lambdabot> Okay, BARBRA STREISAND, I recognize you now!!  Also EFREM ZIMBALIST,
04:13:14 <lambdabot>  JUNIOR!!  And BEAUMONT NEWHALL!!  Everybody into th' BATHROOM!
04:13:40 <steveh> blast
04:13:43 <steveh> my car is overheating
04:13:53 <steveh> how I wish Americans believed in light rail
04:14:10 <steveh> because an hour-long bus ride is not very tenable
04:14:19 <steveh> especially when the last bus already left
04:18:28 <shapr> bonjour mattam_
04:19:00 <shapr> so I have the urge to write a mailserver in Haskell
04:20:51 <Lunar^> shapr: ?
04:21:00 <Lunar^> shapr: Why do you need that ?
04:21:55 <shapr> I have an idea how to change the email system to make spam more difficult
04:22:10 <Lunar^> Tell me more ?
04:22:44 <shapr> push notifications, but the actual email is pull only
04:23:18 <Lunar^> What about spam ?
04:24:02 <shapr> just a moment, I'm going to post what I've written on my wiwiwi
04:24:12 <Lunar^> neat :0
04:25:14 <shapr> assuming I can remember how to get to my wiwiwi....
04:28:41 <shapr> hi latz|twn 
04:29:43 <Segora> shapr: I suspect that wouldn't make spam much more difficult. More and more spam gets sent via worm-infected hosts. 
04:30:05 <Segora> but a decent mail-handling framework in haskell would be cool anyway
04:31:13 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/wiwiwi/blog.cgi?action=view&name=AntiSpamServer
04:36:11 <shapr> ?
04:38:12 <shapr> any thoughts or comments?
04:38:58 <shapr> Segora: I think it will make a difference, for reasons I've detailed on that page.
04:39:00 <shapr> Segora: what do you think?
04:40:45 <Segora> I think when spammers continue to use hosts from joe random user with quite a random distribution (like it seems to be the case now), the increased cost of sending email won't hit the spammers but the home computer users with bad security
04:41:28 <shapr> if the cracked boxen have a static ip, you can block it once you find out it's a spam sender
04:41:36 <ddarius> It should however lower wasted bandwidth and lessen the burden on the receiving end.
04:41:45 <shapr> if it's a dynamic ip, then you won't get the spams it notifies you about, since it won't have the same ip
04:42:19 <shapr> thing is, this introduces more sender accountability into email 
04:42:32 <ddarius> The receiving server can just drop any mail sent to it that wasn't requested.
04:44:42 <shapr> so, I'd like to hear about any flaws you guys see
04:44:58 <shapr> if nothing really bad comes up, I'll assume it's worth implementing
04:45:30 <Segora> when worms are used for sending spam, the infection rate (and thus the rate at which new IP addresses have to be blocked) is likely to increase more quickly than can handle it.
04:45:36 <Segora> s/than/than you/
04:45:59 <ddarius> Okay, is that any worse than the situation now?
04:46:56 <Segora> yes. It introduces a new scheme which isn't widely accepted right now and reliablility decreases.
04:47:19 <Segora> Email was designed to be asynchronous. You make it synchronous.
04:47:20 <shapr> the current scheme sucks
04:47:23 <ddarius> Yes, the largest hurdle is social. I'm only looking at the technical side right now.
04:48:47 <shapr> the way I've thought of it, a notification is just an email limited to an 80 char subject line
04:49:07 <shapr> free content is limited to 80 chars, that is
04:49:22 <Segora> Anyway the best anti-spam measures were fired at Bagdad in large quantities. Maybe only a dozen or so on the relevant locations all over the world would have decreased spam volume noticably.
04:49:24 <shapr> then you go and retrieve the actual mail that's waiting on the sending server.
04:50:01 <shapr> truly, cruise missiles are precision instruments.
04:50:26 <shapr> but I'd rather change the balance so that spam just isn't worthwhile.
04:51:14 <Segora> anyway, I'm not sure if I understand your protocol completely. How does the receiver decide which emails to actually retrieve?
04:51:28 <dennisb> seems like a nice idea, the 80 bytes does not even has to be the subject, just some data telling where the mail is and from whom
04:51:36 <shapr> by default, you retrieve all of your email, right?
04:51:48 <ddarius> Segora: How do you decide which email you read and which you junk?
04:52:06 <dennisb> Segora: it's not important, the importent part is that if you don't do it directly it can be inserted into the spam-databases before you try to collect it
04:52:16 <shapr> right
04:52:18 <Segora> ddarius: by a combination of means. Leaving out all software, I pick and read.
04:52:38 <dennisb> one can have whitelists that accepts other mail directly and fetches them, unknown mail can wait a while
04:53:01 <shapr> right, you have a much better idea of the content of your email *before* you download a megabyte of Swen
04:53:50 <ddarius> Segora: You can't tell at least some spam by it's subject line alone?  Do you really need the entire email to decide that it is junk?
04:54:08 <Segora> ddarius: certainly not
04:54:17 <shapr> rating becomes associated with user@host, since it's much harder to fake user@host, and you don't get to fake host if you want your email to be picked up.
04:54:25 <dennisb> the key thing is that the sender has to sit there waiting for people to fetch the mails, he has to have a server and so on. It's not a send-and-go-operation anymore
04:54:39 <shapr> right, it introduces accountability
04:54:47 <Segora> not really
04:54:59 <shapr> more accountability
04:55:00 <dennisb> still, viruses that sends from a lot of computers is still a little problem
04:55:48 <isomer> how about a non-technical solution: bounty hunters track down known spammers and explain the situation to them
04:55:56 <shapr> isomer: good idea
04:55:57 <Segora> a public key infrastructure + a rating system could solve the problem
04:56:03 <dennisb> isomer: you can do that too
04:56:08 <Segora> isomer: :)
04:56:30 <isomer> ...and while they're out there, they can explain a few things to a couple of CEOs i can think of...
04:56:36 <shapr> heh
04:56:59 <shapr> Segora: with the current system, you still have to download the email and check the GPG sig
04:57:22 <shapr> I want to stop spam before I ever download it, as much as that is possible.
04:57:28 <dennisb> there was some proposal where the sender had to solve a mathematical problem given by the reciever so that the sender server has to spend a little cpu time for each mail sent, if it does not answer correctly the mail is droped
04:57:41 <shapr> sure, that was hashCash
04:57:48 <Segora> shapr: the cost for accepting emails isn't important to me right now.
04:58:17 <shapr> I have a friend who owns an ISP, he has a single server running SpamAssassin for his clients. The disk fried after three months.
04:58:18 <Segora> shapr: the resource i would like to protect is not cpu cycles, at least not from some computer cpu.
04:58:54 <dennisb> shapr: must be because spamassassin is implemented in a strange toy-like language :-)
04:58:58 <shapr> heh
04:59:13 <Segora> shapr: maybe he should have added more memory ;)
04:59:31 <shapr> Segora: I think it had 512mb
04:59:41 <ddarius> Segora: Technically, how would you be worse off than now?
05:01:09 <Segora> ddarius: I would have to use new, mostly untested functionality in a core service just to communicate with very few people.
05:01:34 <shapr> Segora: you could help write tests ;-)
05:01:42 <shapr> HUnit, QuickCheck, Eprover :-)
05:02:03 <Segora> shapr: well, maybe :)
05:02:18 <isomer> note to self: not 18 anymore. hell, not even 28 anymore. clubbing till 3am, then getting up at 7:30am no longer feasible
05:02:43 <isomer> off to my lab....wish me luck that i don't spill bad stuff everywhere
05:02:48 <shapr> Segora: anyways, everything is untested when you first write it, so that doesn't seem like a technical flaw to me.
05:02:54 <shapr> isomer: good luck
05:03:00 <isomer> thks
05:03:05 * isomer is away: stumbling to lab
05:05:40 <shapr> anyone else see flaws?
05:05:57 <steveh> heh
05:06:17 <steveh> i went to see electric skychurch on a weeknight
05:06:21 <steveh> had to leave at 1 :-P
05:10:19 <det> shapr: how could that would with existing SMTP servers yours would need to interact with
05:11:14 <shapr> det: since this system would use SMTP and POP3 as well, interoperability would be easy
05:12:29 <det> shapr: I mean, does SMTP have a mechanism where you can tell the sender, hold onto this mail and I will contact you later to recieve it ?
05:13:30 <shapr> not that I'm aware of, though I haven't read the SMTP RFC
05:13:38 <det> then how would this work ?
05:13:45 <det> or maybe I am misunderstanding
05:14:25 <shapr> I have my own colo server, but if I were a normal user with an ISP account, I would send my mail via SMTP to my ISP's mail server.
05:14:53 <shapr> that server would send a notification to the final destination, then the final destination could retrive my sent mail from the server.
05:15:09 <Segora> hmm. the receiver could reply with tmpfail (4xx) somewhere during the negotiation.
05:15:30 <shapr> Segora: explain?
05:15:40 <Segora> well..
05:16:02 <Segora> A first implementation could work like this:
05:16:27 <det> shapr: sure, if you were implementing all this from scratch, but how can you iplement this to work with SMTP,
05:16:33 <det> s,//
05:16:51 <Segora> You modify your receiving mail server to collect data until the message id and enough data for the 'notification' is collected.
05:17:53 <Segora> the notification is presented to the user. if he decides to read the mail, it gets marked as downloadable and is collected upon the next delivery attempt from the remote mta.
05:18:00 <shapr> Segora: interesting idea
05:18:16 <Segora> it's far from perfect but would implement your scheme in a way that works with current mail systems.
05:18:32 <shapr> cute hack
05:18:46 <Segora> the next improvement would then be etrn
05:19:28 <Segora> so that the receiving mail exchanger can open a smtp connection to the sender, submit ETRN and get the waiting messages.
05:20:10 <shapr> is there some way you can tmpfail on some messages, and still get the rest of the messages?
05:20:22 <shapr> that is, assuming you're being sent several at once
05:20:33 <Segora> that depends on the sender
05:20:39 <ddarius> I don't think any protocols would need to change so much as the way they are being used.
05:20:48 <shapr> ddarius: yes, I agree.
05:21:31 <Segora> I think some MTAs cease delivery attempts to a tmpfailing destination MX for some time
05:22:21 <Segora> the hack I proposed would not be robust in that case.
05:24:51 <ddarius> Ultimately, it would need to become generally accepted, but it seems like a win for all involved (except of course spammers).
05:25:15 <shapr> which is good to hear :-)
05:25:30 <shapr> and it uses existing protocols, which is extremely important
05:25:43 <det> Segora: but you could request the server to re-send it with ETRN, right ?
05:39:11 <Segora> det: when the server is configured to do so, yes.
06:08:17 <shapr> I've added some more text to that page, anything I missed that should be mentioned?
06:10:14 * ddarius reloads again. Wow, watching real-time web-editing.
06:10:29 <shapr> heh :-)
06:10:35 <ejt> are there any nice examples of using haskell to write little languages that people would recommend ?
06:11:30 <ddarius> FRP and related, some hardware verification things (Hawk?), DuckLogic
06:11:42 <shapr> DuckLogic??
06:11:55 <ejt> thx
06:12:31 <ddarius> http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~nday/Research/DuckLogic/
06:13:07 <shapr> interesting
06:14:50 <ddarius> You could extend the second user story to include that (in the ultimate system) full unsolicited emails would be dropped much sooner/immediately lessening wasted bandwidth.
06:15:28 <ddarius> The TITANIC is sunk.
06:15:34 <shapr> that's still a bad joke
06:15:43 <shapr> but funny
06:16:56 <ddarius> I imagine excess flood was the real Titanic's problem too.
06:17:30 <Segora> excess flood... hmm.
06:42:39 <shapr> hi jao
06:42:57 <shapr> dang, I ordered a 3" metal studded snow tire for my unicycle, but they're currently out
06:45:09 <jao> hey shapr
07:21:07 <shapr> wheee
07:21:30 <shapr> hey jao, any comments on http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/wiwiwi/blog.cgi?action=view&name=AntiSpamServer ?
07:22:26 * jao looks
07:25:31 <jao> shapr: hm. at first sight, looks like a good idea... is it yours?
07:25:35 <shapr> yes
07:26:03 <jao> nice. are you planning to implement something of the sort?
07:26:26 <shapr> yes
07:26:30 <shapr> in Haskell even :-)
07:26:44 <jao> heh, i had guessed that bit :)
07:26:45 <shapr> but I'd like to get any input on the design before implementation starts
07:27:16 <tic> shapr, did you hear my pattern-matching hack for Python?
07:27:29 <shapr> tic: no, tell me
07:27:34 <shapr> did xoltar have anything?
07:27:50 <jao> shapr: sure. but an initial prototype would be nice to experiment and find any hidden shortcut..
07:27:58 <tic> shapr, note though; this is only for very trivial cases.
07:28:01 <tic> here goes:
07:28:02 <shapr> jao: true
07:28:10 <tic> fib = Function()
07:28:13 <tic> fib[0] = 0
07:28:15 <tic> fib[1] = 1
07:28:25 <tic> fib["n"] = "fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)"
07:28:35 <tic> >>> fib(7)
07:28:36 <tic> 13
07:28:37 <tic> =)
07:28:40 <phubuh> Haha, that's cool
07:28:52 <tic> (I don't have it implemented, just came up with the idea)
07:55:51 <shapr> hi esskay 
07:56:03 <shapr> do you use Haskell?
07:56:19 <shapr> is your name coincidentally related to the lambda calculus combinators?
07:56:32 <esskay> shapr: hello 
07:56:45 <esskay> shapr: i've used gofer..it's a subset of haskell
07:56:53 <esskay> shapr: you mean SKI combinators?
07:56:55 <shapr> yup
07:57:12 <esskay> shapr: have you heard of gofer?
07:57:15 <shapr> yes, I have.
07:57:18 <shapr> I've never used it though.
07:57:35 <ddarius> Know what Hugs stands for shapr?
07:57:39 <esskay> i'm studyting cs at pune, university.
07:57:43 <shapr> ddarius: no?
07:57:47 <esskay> hugs- haskell users gofer system
07:57:49 <shapr> Haskell User Gofer..
07:57:50 <shapr> aha
07:57:52 <shapr> I was guessing
07:58:14 <esskay> the first language we learnt was gofer
07:58:19 <shapr> oh, neat
07:58:30 <esskay> our lecturer had modified it alittle bit
07:59:03 <esskay> only the syntax..he had changed the applicative operator to . and . to compose
07:59:21 <shapr> ah, I see
07:59:51 <shapr> sounds like you could easily adjust to Haskell.
07:59:59 <shapr> want to write a lambdabot plugin? :-)
08:00:24 <shapr> ddarius: any ideas for a good name for the antispam server?
08:00:31 <esskay> but i hardly know any haskell, i tried hugs once ..just looked at the demo programs
08:00:46 <shapr> I've heard Gofer is very close to Haskell.
08:01:24 <esskay> i've read most of bird and wadler though..so i should be able to write some stuff..
08:01:26 <ddarius> I believe Gofer was intended as a Haskell with a bunch of (then) experimental additions.
08:01:34 <esskay> is there a haskell wiki or something?
08:01:38 <shapr> sure
08:01:54 <shapr> http://purl.org/wiki/haskell/RecentChanges 
08:01:57 <shapr> or http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
08:03:35 <esskay> shapr: have you tried Q?
09:31:19 <shapr> esskay: the quantum programming language Q? no
10:16:27 <kokank> Hi all ! 
10:18:04 <sild> hi
10:20:34 <shapr> hiya
10:20:34 <kokank> I learning AI and wanted to check what Haskell is. 
10:22:32 <shapr> It's great :-)
10:23:01 <shapr> have you seen http://www.haskell.org/learning.html ?
10:23:11 <kokank> ya .. just now 
10:24:51 <shapr> kokank: are you learning AI in college?
10:25:24 <kokank> nope I am planning to do my masters and take up AI there. Currently I am a Software Engg in India. 
10:25:38 <kokank> I am learning AI on my own now. 
10:25:43 <shapr> ah cool, self taught is a great way to learn
10:25:56 <kokank> ya .. I agree. 
10:26:28 <shapr> have you used any functional languages before? lisp or scheme?
10:26:45 <Pinnen> AI? Artificial Intelligence? (spellmaster  :) )
10:26:50 <Pinnen> hehe
10:26:51 <kokank> I have started with Lisp. Have'nt done much on it. 
10:27:06 <shapr> hej Pinnen, vad händer?
10:27:13 <Pinnen> shapr: tjena!
10:27:16 <Pinnen> jag spelar lite nu
10:27:19 <Pinnen> kommer sedan! ;)
10:27:23 <Pinnen> hade gött
10:27:57 <shapr> kokank: lisp is pretty straightforward, but I'd recommend you start with Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
10:28:22 <shapr> vilken spel gör du?
10:28:34 <shapr> most of the lisp I've written is elisp, in emacs
10:28:39 <kokank> okay 
10:29:01 <shapr> oh, I can show you a short demo of Haskell features and syntax...
10:29:04 <Pinnen> shapr: jag spelar quake3 :-)
10:29:11 <shapr> http://purl.org/net/shapr/src/haskell/Demo.hs
10:29:12 <Pinnen> shapr: ibland
10:29:14 <Pinnen> hehe
10:29:22 <shapr> jag spelar America's Army
10:29:33 <shapr> allt på linux 
10:29:35 <Pinnen> shapr: är det roligt?
10:29:45 <Pinnen> jupp.. jag kör quake3 i linux också :-)
10:29:48 <Pinnen> kör bara linux
10:29:50 <shapr> ja, det är bra, om du trivs med counterstrike eller andra
10:29:51 <Pinnen> inget windows
10:29:54 <shapr> yay!
10:29:59 <shapr> I'm a great fan of Linux
10:30:08 <Pinnen> shapr: har spelat mycket counter-strike i mina yngre dagar
10:30:14 <Pinnen> me 2 :-)
10:30:15 <shapr> jag med
10:30:17 <shapr> can I say that?
10:30:26 <shapr> I've seen "jag med" used as "me too"
10:30:31 <shapr> but I don't know if was correct there.
10:31:02 <shapr> I played counterstrike on linux :-)
10:31:18 <shapr> kokank: do you have any specific questions about Haskell?
10:31:47 <kokank> Not yet. Give me some time. I'll learn it and get back to you. 
10:32:03 <shapr> kokank: you can also ask questions here while you're learning
10:32:09 <kokank> cool 
10:32:12 <shapr> I learned faster from the answers I got here on #haskell
10:33:18 <kokank> what compiler do I need ? 
10:33:35 <shapr> I'd recommend GHC6
10:33:44 <shapr> the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler
10:38:52 <kokank> Hey shapr, Thanx a lot. I'll get back to you soon !
10:39:01 <shapr> sure, any time
10:50:34 * SyntaxPolice wondesr why kokank messaged him
10:50:38 <SyntaxPolice> wonders even
13:05:35 <shapr> @yow
13:05:36 <lambdabot> Life is selling REVOLUTIONARY HAIR PRODUCTS!
13:09:46 <ski> @yow
13:09:46 <lambdabot> The Korean War must have been fun.
13:10:15 <shapr> hi ski 
13:10:20 <ski> hi shapr
13:10:21 <shapr> what's up?
13:10:31 <ski> not much
13:10:52 <ski> testing a weird way of implementing datatypes, sortof ..
13:13:29 <ski> (using type classes ..)
13:15:43 <ski> and you ?
13:16:03 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/wiwiwi/blog.cgi?action=edit&name=AntiSpamServer
13:16:10 <shapr> er, that should be view, oops
13:16:30 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/wiwiwi/blog.cgi?action=view&name=AntiSpamServer
13:16:44 <shapr> how to write a mail server in Haskell?
13:17:47 <ski> heh, just wondered if you meant me to edit it  :)
13:18:15 <shapr> sure, add something cool :-)
13:21:03 <ski> hmm, seems like an interesting take on the problem
13:22:35 <shapr> thought of anything that's not mentioned there that should be?
13:22:37 <shapr> have any questions?
13:24:32 <isomer> where's the part about guido and nunzio?
13:24:44 <ski> can't think of any right now
13:25:09 <shapr> isomer: that's your part ;-)
13:25:47 <isomer> oh, right. am i supposed to add it as an alternate scheme?
13:26:59 <shapr> yes, I think so
13:27:30 <isomer> okay :)
13:29:09 <ski> shapr : who is the Anti-Penguin ?
13:30:29 <isomer> mr. moose?
18:42:39 <`john> wow
18:42:52 <`john> the haskell room really grew. :)
18:43:11 <mvw> just lurking
18:43:47 <`john> oh
18:45:33 <`john> there a macro languages or subset langauge in haskell for SQL like operations for homegrown type databases?
22:10:42 <crass> anyone have a link to a tutorial on ghc's openGL interface?
22:16:37 <ski> crass : mayhaps http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~haskell/hopengl/index.html provides what you seek ??
22:18:04 <crass> ski: thanks, and do you perhaps konw how to get commandline opts in a haskell program?
22:18:50 <ski> getArgs :: IO [String]    ??
22:19:14 <ski> or do you mean a getopt library ?
22:19:22 <crass> no, that might work
22:19:24 <crass> thanks
22:19:35 <crass> like argv in C
22:21:22 <ski> also hugs (at least Feb2001) has an  argv :: [String]  in IOExtensions, if you for some reason can't stand the IO for this  (unno if GHC or NHC provides anything similar)
22:22:20 <crass> thanks
22:22:45 <ski> crass : note that getArgs doesn't give you the program name, if you want that, i see a getProgName in System
22:23:05 <crass> ok, thanks
22:24:46 <ski> crass : you might perhaps want to consider using this library for handling command line options : http://www.pms.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/mitarbeiter/panne/haskell_libs/GetOpt.html
22:25:43 <ski> but if you just want some simple options, making it by hand might be preferrable ...
22:26:53 <crass> ski, yeah I'm just playing right now, thanks for the links though
22:28:08 <ski> (the last link was just taken from www.haskell.org's library-subpage, btw)
22:30:25 <crass> ski: thakns I'll use that as a reference
23:17:30 <crass> ski: what lib is getArgs :: IO [String] in ?
23:22:33 <norpan> System or System.Environment (in the new hslibs)
23:23:34 <crass> thanks
23:48:52 <crass> how do I get the Strign array out of getArgs?
23:49:04 <crass> I just want to bind it to a variable
