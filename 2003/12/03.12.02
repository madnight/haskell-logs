03:45:24 <TripleDES> morning
03:45:27 <shapr> hiya
03:54:05 * Marvin-- mutters about conference fees being way too high for students
03:57:37 <shapr> which conf?
04:02:33 <Marvin--> EP
04:03:07 <shapr> how much is it?
04:03:54 <Marvin--> EUR 100
04:07:28 <shapr> hm
04:08:01 <Marvin--> that's the student price
04:09:04 <Marvin--> and I have no idea how much it'd be since I'm far from active in the python "community"
04:32:10 <mathieul> Hi all, I am with my students right now and I am showing them the pleasures of IRC through FreeNode
04:32:19 <ibid> hello all there :)
04:32:22 <mathieul> I'll teach them some bits of Haskell in some weeks
04:32:27 <andersca> hello students!
04:32:51 <andersca> and this is where you shouldn't come when you get stuck with your assignments :)
04:33:12 <mathieul> They are used to Python and they'll migrate to Java next
04:33:40 <mathieul> but on the way, I'll show them the pleasures of using Haskell (and functional languages in general)
04:33:47 <shapr> that's good!
04:34:38 <mathieul> bye
04:43:29 <Marvin--> d'oh, I missed the students! :)
04:45:29 <Marvin--> hmm
04:46:51 <Marvin--> does anybody know what paper the extended guards come from?
04:47:36 <Lor> It's that... well, one of them.
04:47:49 * Lor recalls having read at least one proposal for extending guards.
04:48:27 <Marvin--> well, ghc -fglasgow-exts has one
04:48:41 <Lor> Hm, "pattern guards and transformational patterns" by Erwing and SPJ?
04:49:01 <Lor> Erwig, sorry.
04:49:40 <Marvin--> I should've guessed that SPJ was involved
04:50:05 <Lor> spj is involved in everything. :)
04:50:25 <Marvin--> aiih, 404
04:51:08 <Marvin--> *cough* no worries, looks like I already had it
04:52:18 <Lor> Hm, what's a good tool for making simple data structure diagrams?
04:52:51 <Lor> I need to represent trees and records and string fragments and thatlike stuff.
05:02:14 * Marvin-- watches the list of references grow
05:03:48 <Lor> What are you doing?
05:06:03 <Marvin--> working on the report for my degree project
05:06:45 <Marvin--> fun fun when you realize "hey wait a minute, this is as the same as <another random thing I've read about elsewhere>"
05:13:44 <norpan> not as much fun when you discover that that other random thing not only is the same, but better
05:13:53 <norpan> and all your work was for nothing
05:17:28 <Marvin--> well yeah
05:17:33 <Marvin--> in this case it was actually not really a bad thing
05:18:01 <Marvin--> I've been using something like pattern guards implicitly in the transformations and only realized it when I started writing about the transformation
05:18:14 <Marvin--> this way I probably cut down a page from the report and replaced it with a reference instead :)
06:05:34 <SyntaxNinja> was someone talking about me?!?!
06:05:41 * SyntaxNinja prepares to flip out
06:08:07 <norpan> pattern guards are nice
06:08:42 <Marvin--> norpan: indeed
06:08:57 <norpan> cut's down on a lot of code
06:09:01 <norpan> cuts
06:09:28 <norpan> SIGAPSTRPH - Illegal use of apostrophe
09:13:12 <Marvin--> heh, Rumsfeld got the foot-in-mouth award
09:55:07 <ecraven> is there any way to really use haskell interactively?
09:55:37 <ecraven> some interpreter-like interface like most CLs or Schemes?
09:55:49 <Lor> Hugs and ghci.
09:56:26 <Lor> You sound like you have only used ghc. In that case, just try typing "ghci", you probably have that installed as well.
09:57:34 <ecraven> hm.. i tried with ghci.. how can i e.g. define length? if i try let length [] = 0 <enter> let length (x:xs)... it doesn't work..
09:57:48 <ecraven> how can i do multiline-definitions?
09:58:04 <ibid> let { length [] = 0 ; length (x:xs) ... }
09:58:06 <Lor> What you just typed isn't legal in a full haskell program either
09:58:16 <ibid> you put it to one line :)
09:58:17 <ecraven> ibid: ah tx!
09:58:43 <ecraven> is there a useful emacs mode for haskell?
09:58:49 <ibid> yes
09:58:54 <ibid> though it is a little buggy
09:59:23 <Lor> You don't really need the braces there...
09:59:44 <ibid> perhaps not, i'm just used to adding them :)
09:59:58 <ibid> as i think of that as non-layout 
10:00:53 <ecraven> ah, it starts to work like i want it ;-) i'll lurk some more here, thanks!
10:06:00 <ecraven> can i somehow run the current buffer through ghc and show the output from haskell-mode inside emacs?
10:06:19 <ibid> yes, but i don't remember how
10:06:34 <ibid> well, you could create a makefile and use M-x compile :)
10:07:39 <ecraven> ;-) 
10:19:48 <blacksheep> hey! i have done some opengl bindings for haskell that allows to draw a geomtric figure, giving their vertices. Do you think this would be usefull? maybe for students or something...
10:20:12 <andersca> blacksheep: you know about HOpenGL, don't you?
10:23:45 <blacksheep> andersca_: no. i am in my 1st year of the uni. i don't know much about haskell... my bindings are pretty simple, but they let you do some neat stuff, do you wanna see a screenshot?
10:24:03 <andersca> sure
10:24:04 <blacksheep> i have also done bindings for sdl, but i have leave them now
10:24:42 <blacksheep> hold on...
10:25:11 <blacksheep> http://rpmcruz.planetaclix.pt/trash/gl-hs.png
10:25:25 <ham[home]> hiho
10:26:16 <andersca> cool
10:26:24 <andersca> blacksheep: http://www.haskell.org/HOpenGL
10:26:37 <blacksheep> i will put the code in a website, but i am not been able to compile it in this computer, maybe some package is missing...
10:26:56 <blacksheep> and i don't have mandrake cds here :( i am trying to download them in a ftp
10:29:01 <blacksheep> andersca_: but do you think it is usefull for something? education?
10:29:36 <andersca> blacksheep: I dunno
10:29:43 <emu> blacksheep: dark has done haskell sdl bindings too
10:29:54 <emu> you should talk to him
10:30:35 <Smerdyakov> dark is a jack off all trades.
10:31:21 * emu peers at Smerdyakov 
10:32:20 <blacksheep> anyway, i am a newbie in both haskell and opengl :) i just like to code for fun, and i was hoping that you guys would tell me what would be the usefullness of these bindings, since i would let to show them to my teacher ;)
10:32:30 <blacksheep> s/let/like
10:33:07 <blacksheep> futhermore, haskell is not meant for graphical output, since it requires text output
10:34:46 <blacksheep> and i don't get it why the code is not compiling in my main computer, only in my laptop. what gl package am i missing? argh!
10:35:39 <Smerdyakov> "Haskell is not meant for graphical output"... can't say I see what you mean.
10:37:21 <blacksheep> Smerdyakov: for instance, you tell him to draw a square, and it will draw it, but will have to return some text output, it can't just output drawings, like in c
10:37:57 <blacksheep> does haskell have support for void functions?
10:38:04 <Smerdyakov> Tell "him"?
10:38:13 <Smerdyakov> I don't understand this about returning text output.
10:38:18 <mattam> blacksheep: you mean unit (() constructor)
10:38:24 <Smerdyakov> The Haskell compilers will generally have your main function return IO ()
10:38:31 <Smerdyakov> Which has no idea of text output built in.
10:38:53 <blacksheep> i am not using a compiler, but the interpreter hugs
10:39:09 <Smerdyakov> What I say still applies.
10:39:21 <Smerdyakov> I don't think any Haskell anything requires anything to product text output.
10:39:38 <ddarius> blacksheep: You can't "just output drawings" in C either.
10:40:08 <blacksheep> ddarius: yep, but i can call a function to draw something and doesnt't output anything
10:40:29 <Smerdyakov> Same in Haskell...
10:40:54 <blacksheep> Smerdyakov: if you say so... i thought it *allways* needed some output...
10:41:01 <Smerdyakov> No.
10:41:11 <Smerdyakov> I don't even understand what you mean by "needing output."
10:41:14 <Smerdyakov> What does that mean in terms of the Haskell type system?
10:42:53 <SyntaxNinja> blacksheep: working with an interpreter might give you that impression
10:43:09 <blacksheep> i don't know what you mean either. anyway, i am getting mad, since i don't know what i have to install to be able to compile the damn code! argh!
10:43:32 <SyntaxNinja> in particular, when you type in just a function, it might complain that it can't "Show" that function
10:43:38 <Smerdyakov> blacksheep, you're the one who said "nees output." You don't even know what YOU mean? :D
10:43:41 <Smerdyakov> needs
10:44:03 <SyntaxNinja> blackdog_: but it is definitely the case that the interpreter can draw windows in response to commands.
10:44:16 <SyntaxNinja> you might try something simpler like the graphics library for the Haskell School of Expression book.
10:44:28 <SyntaxNinja> (that was for blacksheep of course)
10:44:54 <SyntaxNinja> blacksheep: if you want help compiling, you might want to tell us what the problem is, unless you have already (just got here).
10:46:14 <blacksheep> i don't have the /usr/X11R6/lib/GL directory in this computer, what package should i install? i'm using mandrake
10:46:41 * SyntaxNinja knows nothing of mandrake. is there some kind of opengl-dev package or something?
10:46:55 <SyntaxNinja> or is that library someplace else?
10:47:03 <Jad> blacksheep: mesa3d.org
10:47:20 <blacksheep> opengl doesn't exist for linux. there is a compatible library called mesa
10:47:28 <Jad> ya
10:47:33 <Jad> blacksheep: get mesa3d
10:48:09 <blacksheep> i have installed: libMesaGLU1-devel, libMesaGL1, libMesaGLU1, Mesa . am i missing anything?
10:48:32 <Jad> dunno i use debian
10:48:34 <Jad> i just apt-get
10:48:37 <Smerdyakov> Maybe libMesaGL1-devel?
10:48:47 <blacksheep> Jad: mandrake has urpmi
10:49:02 <Jad> blacksheep: don`t you need glut ?
10:49:50 <blacksheep> Smerdyakov: you sure are smart ;) but i can't find that in the ftp rpository
10:50:01 <blacksheep> Jad: i don't use glut, i use SDL
10:50:45 <blacksheep> i don't like glut, since the windows version is better than the linux one :P
10:51:22 <blacksheep> i miss the libgl files at /usr/X11R6/lib/
10:51:46 <blacksheep> going to ask for help @ #opengl
10:54:55 <Jad> ah okay..
10:55:00 <Jad> k.
11:00:06 <TripleDES> hi
11:00:09 <SyntaxNinja> hey TripleDES
11:00:34 <TripleDES> wasup ? :)
11:00:51 <SyntaxNinja> not much, hacking away.
11:16:48 <ecraven> how can i define main so that it just prints an integer? main = ..?
11:17:22 <andersca> print 42
11:18:10 <ecraven> weee! thanks
11:19:41 <blacksheep> i am not being able to compile it, i will come to here later... bye
11:20:16 <SyntaxNinja> andersca: 42 is the correct answer!
11:20:21 <andersca> SyntaxNinja: it always is
11:20:41 <SyntaxNinja> hmmmmmm
13:01:25 <BiO-bRoLy> hi
13:07:46 <cm> hey
13:08:37 <BiO-bRoLy> any1 with time to do an exercice :P
13:09:18 <andersca> I'd say you
13:09:19 <andersca> :)
13:10:07 <BiO-bRoLy> lol
13:10:14 <BiO-bRoLy> any1 who knows haskell :P
13:10:35 <Bauas> which exercice?
13:11:44 <Bauas> hei
13:11:44 * Marvin-- idly wonders why his rhythmbox keeps crashing
13:12:43 <BiO-bRoLy> its an exercice using another.. like i've done lSystem.hs and know i've to make lTurtle.hs using lsystem in module
13:12:54 <BiO-bRoLy> its an exercice using another.. like i've done lSystem.hs and now i've to make lTurtle.hs using lsystem in module
13:14:18 <BiO-bRoLy> One has touched of keyboard key and draws data system L in order 0. In the following touch we thus draw the system in order 1, and for ahead.
13:14:46 <BiO-bRoLy> to fininsh we click Escape
13:15:25 <Bauas> ok.. continue.. after this write Lsystems.hs
13:15:40 <BiO-bRoLy> The this exercise as objectivo is to write a function lTurtle that, given to a set of rules of cellular division and an axiom, it opens a window and it behaves above as described For example
13:16:01 <BiO-bRoLy> > lTurtle lSystem [(’X’,"-YF+XFX+FY-"),(’Y’,"+XF-YFY-FX+")] "X"
13:16:11 <BiO-bRoLy> makes a draw with very lines  :P
13:16:49 <Bauas> objectivo? are you portuguese?
13:17:04 <BiO-bRoLy> yes
13:17:29 <Bauas> cool me too
13:17:38 <BiO-bRoLy> es portugues ou portuguesa?
13:17:48 <Marvin--> oh dear :)
13:17:51 <Bauas> portuguesa
13:17:56 <Marvin--> there goes the channel ;)
13:18:00 <BiO-bRoLy> lol
13:18:20 <BiO-bRoLy> Marvin-- can u help me please :P 
13:18:34 <BiO-bRoLy> es de onde Bauas ? :))
13:18:38 <Bauas> ahahah we're joking 
13:20:03 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: rhythmbox crashing at startup?
13:20:14 <Marvin--> BiO-bRoLy: I'll tell you your first mistake: bothering me off-channel
13:20:42 <Marvin--> SyntaxNinja: no, while running, I can't say I've tried very hard at figuring out a pattern of it though, maybe I have a broken file somewhere
13:21:01 <Marvin--> when did you turn into a ninja anyway? :)
13:21:31 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: what rb version?
13:21:42 <Bauas> and.. "there goes the channel ;)" lol
13:21:52 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: I was police, then I became enlightened and insane, now I'm a ninja. I flip out.
13:22:01 <Marvin--> SyntaxNinja: ooh
13:22:06 <Marvin--> SyntaxNinja: 0.6.0-1
13:22:16 <andersca> Marvin--: do you have mixed ogg and mp3 files?
13:22:23 <Marvin--> andersca: yeah
13:22:41 <Marvin--> why do I get the feeling I'll hear "known bug" next?
13:22:47 <andersca> you won't
13:22:55 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: odd. it's been really stable for me.
13:22:58 <andersca> I've seen this too, but I don't know if it's known
13:23:06 * SyntaxNinja has ogg and mp3 files too
13:23:14 <SyntaxNinja> btw, if you guys want, I'll punch colin in the arm for you :)
13:23:20 * SyntaxNinja has physical access
13:23:32 <Marvin--> I'll try to remember to keep track of when it crashes
13:23:35 <Marvin--> physical access, eh
13:23:39 <BiO-bRoLy> Marvin-- sorry
13:23:41 <BiO-bRoLy> didnt know
13:23:43 <SyntaxNinja> but colin is also a ninja (I refer you to: http://www.syntaxpolice.org/tmp/youAreAnAnimal.jpg)
13:24:31 <Marvin--> SyntaxNinja: thank him for the whisky :-)
13:24:34 <Marvin--> SyntaxNinja: and then punch him ;)
13:24:51 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: deal
13:24:57 <Marvin--> no wait
13:25:06 <Marvin--> wrong Colin, methinks
13:25:21 <SyntaxNinja> you're not thinking of colin watson are you?
13:25:24 <Marvin--> whisky -> cjwatson, punch -> walters
13:25:25 <SyntaxNinja> because walters will flip out
13:25:29 <Marvin--> I know, I know :)
13:26:10 <Marvin--> so scratch the punch then :)
13:27:48 <SyntaxNinja> :)
13:52:06 <Riastradh> What are the traditional monad terms?  Return is eta, join is mu...what else?
13:53:49 <Lor> What else do you need? :)
13:53:56 <Riastradh> Bah!
13:54:27 <Riastradh> What about bind?  It may be _definable_ in terms of eta and mu, but it's often useful anyways.
14:06:40 <Riastradh> Damnit.  Someone must know!  I want to talk in an that arcane mathematical lingo with smatterings of obscure category theorism that esap et alia speak in!
14:07:17 <Marvin--> so ask esap et al :) I don't know :)
14:07:51 <Lor> What about bind?
14:08:29 <ecraven> esap?
14:08:43 <Lor> I think that bind was really first introduced in Haskell.
14:08:48 <Riastradh> Oh.
14:08:50 <Riastradh> Darn.
14:08:57 <Riastradh> There's no Greek letter for it that I can confuse people with?
14:09:05 <Lor> Not that I recall.
14:09:17 <Marvin--> haha
14:09:34 <Riastradh> Hrumph.  How about for monad composition?
14:09:45 <Marvin--> you're *so* going into QuotesPage for that line :)
14:09:51 <Riastradh> And what are 'reflect' & 'reify?'
14:09:51 <cm> :)
14:10:04 <Lor> Riastradh, up- and down-arrows are sometimes used.
14:10:14 <Riastradh> I can't write those in ASCII text.
14:10:26 <Lor> You were just asking about greek letters.
14:10:29 <cm> \up
14:10:32 <cm> :)
14:10:37 <Riastradh> Then again, I guess I can't write eta or mu, but 'up-arrow' and 'down-arrow' sound so less mathematically arcane than 'eta' and 'mu.'
14:12:19 <Lor> eta and mu are mundane.
14:12:26 <Lor> varsigma and aleph are a bit more exotic.
14:12:36 <Riastradh> Yes, but a lot less mundane than 'up-arrow' and 'down-arrow.'
14:12:48 <Riastradh> But do varsigma and aleph mean the same things?  I think not.
14:13:03 <Lor> Didn't say so.
14:13:16 <Riastradh> Hmm.  What's the unmundane name for 'lift?'
14:13:18 <ecraven> ? wheres aleph used?
14:13:19 <Lor> Maybe we should start using kanji as combinators.
14:13:37 <Lor> ecraven, cardinal numbers.
14:13:39 <ecraven> except in number theory?
14:13:52 <ecraven> so you mean \aleph_0 etc.?
14:13:53 <Lor> Well, hebrew text. :)
14:13:56 <ecraven> lol ;-)
14:14:13 <Riastradh> (by the way, I was asking what 'reflect' & 'reify' _did_, not what their unmundaneful names were)
14:14:23 <Lor> Maybe we should start using kanji in scientific notation.
14:14:28 <Lor> Greek letters are already _so_ overloaded.
14:14:39 <Riastradh> (or what more mundane names for them are so I might already recognize them)
14:14:53 <Lor> I also like the approach taken in logic, where they invent these weird symbols and even weirder names for them.
14:15:11 <Lor> I especially like the implication operator in linear logic, which is pronounced "lollipop".
14:15:27 <Lor> (At least according to a Mr Wadler...)
14:16:10 <Lor> Riastradh, reflect and reify in what context?
14:16:28 <Riastradh> (if it helps to answer my question, 'reflect x' = 'shift k (k >>= x)')
14:16:31 <Lor> I can direct you to some 80's papers on reflection in lisp, where these concepts were widely used.
14:16:45 <Lor> What's shift?
14:16:47 <Riastradh> (and 'reify x' = 'reset (return x)')
14:17:00 <Lor> Ah, those Danvy-Filinski thingies?
14:17:03 <Riastradh> Yes.
14:17:23 <Lor> I've never really delved into them. Ought to.
14:17:40 <Riastradh> http://www.bloodandcoffee.net/campbell/txt/shift-reset-tutorial.log
14:17:40 <Lor> Can you summarize how they differ from ordinary continuations?
14:17:49 <Riastradh> RTFL.
14:20:03 <Riastradh> amb can be defined as, given that eta x = [x] and extend f l = concatMap f l, amb x y = reflect (reify x ++ reify y)
14:20:26 <Riastradh> Er, s/extend f l/l >>= f/1, and s/k >>= x/x >>= k/1.
14:21:24 <Lor> Hm, so shift is like "capture the current continuation to k and call the reset continuation"
14:21:57 <Lor> Offhand, it seems like it's doing two things at the same time, so it doesn't feel very primitive...
14:22:29 <Riastradh> In Danvy's words: RESET specifies a control delimiter.  SHIFT grabs the current continuation up to the current control delimiter, and reifies it as a composable procedure.  If the procedure is not used, SHIFT has the effect of aborting up to the current control delimiter.
14:22:56 <Riastradh> SHIFT and RESET are definable in terms of CALL/CC (and vice versa).
14:25:19 <Lor> So what's so great about them? They're more suitable as primitives in real implementations?
14:25:32 <Riastradh> I'm not sure.  They're just interesting.
14:25:59 <Riastradh> (they _are_ quite a bit faster if implemented primitively rather than on top of CALL/CC)
14:26:25 <Riastradh> (cf. Martin Gasbichler's paper on them and efficient implementations of them)
14:26:46 <Lor> What happens when I do shift outside any reset? The program ends?
14:26:50 <Riastradh> (called 'Final Shift for Call/cc: Direct Implementation of Shift and Reset')
14:26:54 <Riastradh> Or borks in some other way.
14:29:33 <Riastradh> Is there a non-mundane name for 'fmap?'
14:29:44 <Riastradh> 'fmap' sounds not only mundane but also just icky to me.
14:31:47 <Lor> Hm, what was asterisk used for?
14:32:19 <Riastradh> ?
14:32:38 <Marvin--> isn't asterisk often used for bind?
14:33:50 <Lor> No, I think it was a slightly different combinator
14:36:53 <Marvin--> andersca: still around?
14:37:36 <andersca> Marvin--: yeah
14:38:30 <Marvin--> andersca: any news on the shirts?
14:42:23 <andersca> Marvin--: oh, dang, totally forgot about them
14:42:27 * andersca is way busy with his haskell project
14:44:02 <Marvin--> d'oh! :)

16:29:30 <Lor> (bet you cannot pronounce that :)
16:29:45 <andersca> yÃ¶
16:29:46 <andersca> I can
16:31:36 <Lor> Maybe. In swedish, y is more to the front than in finnish, and ö is more to the back.
16:31:57 <Lor> Well, in some Stockholm dialect, anyway. Wouldn't know of other dialects.

17:57:05 <Riastradh> Fine, I'll make up an arcane-sounding name for 'fmap': 'eslupherum.'
18:07:41 <blackdog> shh, the uninitiated might be listening.
18:08:20 <Riastradh> Oh, sorry.  Hey!  You guys who accidentally overheard me!  Go pour soap in your ears and put monads up your nose until you forget that it meant 'fmap!'
18:08:32 <blackdog> haskell's already too easy to use.
18:08:48 <blackdog> oh no!  you said fmap again!
18:08:53 <Riastradh> You did, too!
18:08:58 <Riastradh> You blasphemer!
18:09:01 <blackdog> ah!
18:12:56 <Pseudonym> OK, nobody, and I mean nobody, is to say "fmap" again until I blow this whistle.
18:13:07 <Riastradh> HEY!  You said it!
18:13:16 <Pseudonym> Aargh!
18:13:28 * Riastradh beats Pseudonym into the ground with a bagpipe.
18:13:36 * Arnia strokes the functor
18:13:39 * SyntaxLaptop flips out and kills everyone
18:14:07 <Riastradh> At least that ninja didn't say the 'F' word.
18:14:16 <ayrnieu> Cursed ninjas.
18:14:43 <Arnia> Which f word, the member function of functor?
18:14:59 <Riastradh> Arnia said the C++ 'M' 'F' word!
18:15:04 <Riastradh> (s)
18:15:31 <Arnia> That's m***od
18:15:44 <SyntaxLaptop> any Debian Woody users here?
18:15:51 <Pseudonym> Yes.
18:15:51 <Arnia> I'm talking about pure, lovable functions that are part of a type class
18:16:01 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: are you using haskell-experimental?
18:16:12 <Pseudonym> Let me check my apt-source.
18:16:15 <Riastradh> Let's all start a mass, unsolicited email campaign to inform every other Haskeller on the planet that the 'F' word shall henceforth be referred to as 'eslupherum.'  (And hope it gets to the major Haskellers to go into Haskell 2.0.)
18:16:43 <Pseudonym> deb http://www.syntaxpolice.org/haskell-experimental/ stable/
18:16:47 <Pseudonym> Guess so.
18:17:14 <Pseudonym> hugs is downloading as we speak.
18:17:19 <SyntaxLaptop> schveet
18:17:19 <Pseudonym> Actually, it had finished by the time I git return.
18:17:21 <SyntaxLaptop> you read my mind
18:17:26 <Pseudonym> s/git/hit/
18:17:26 <SyntaxLaptop> you git return?!?!?!!
18:17:31 <SyntaxLaptop> oh, whew
18:17:52 <Riastradh> HEY!  You said the 'R' word!
18:17:57 <Arnia> Riastradh: Blah
18:18:06 <Arnia> returnA banned as well?
18:18:17 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: I was referring to \r, not the monadic unit operation.
18:18:26 <Riastradh> Arnia, no, of course not.
18:18:34 <Arnia> Unit and bind shall die today
18:18:35 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, oh, OK.  That's OK, then.
18:18:41 * Arnia stabs them with a rusty spork
18:18:45 <Arnia> Or is that foon...
18:18:55 <Riastradh> Eta, mu, and eslupherum!  Eta, mu, and eslupherum!
18:19:00 <Riastradh> (all together now)
18:19:04 <Riastradh> Eta, mu, and eslupherum!
18:19:19 <Pseudonym> It even runs.
18:19:26 <Riastradh> NO!  Reflect, not run!
18:19:29 <Riastradh> Oops.
18:19:34 <Riastradh> Wait, there are too many 'R' words.
18:19:34 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: What do we call if a pattern match doesn't succeed?
18:19:45 <Riastradh> Um...um...eviscerate!
18:20:00 <Riastradh> class Monad m where
18:20:05 <Pseudonym> How about "koppa", the pre-classical Greek letter?
18:20:05 <Riastradh>     eta :: a -> m a
18:20:15 <Riastradh>     mu :: m (m a) -> m a
18:20:15 <blackdog> though it hardly scans
18:20:22 <blackdog> oops, nevermind.
18:20:24 <Riastradh>     eviscerate :: String -> a
18:20:33 * Arnia has missed this whole conversation and feels quite left out
18:20:33 <Pseudonym> You said the S word!
18:20:33 <Riastradh> I like eviscerate more.
18:20:46 <Pseudonym> Oh, hang on.
18:20:52 <Riastradh> Arnia, don't worry.  Just reflect & reify yourself!
18:20:52 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: so is that better than February, 2001? :)
18:21:14 <Riastradh> Ack!  Where's lambdabot!?
18:21:16 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: What's my basis for comparison?
18:21:18 <blackdog> Arnia: I wouldn't worry. No-one here's human anyway, we're all just sophisticated markov chain generators.
18:21:28 <Pseudonym> Oh, I know!  I'll run lambdabot with hugs98!
18:21:31 <blackdog> oh no, i said generate!
18:21:34 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: if you don't know, I can't tell you.
18:21:41 <SyntaxLaptop> \msg Pseudonym :type fmap!
18:21:45 <SyntaxLaptop> oops!
18:21:49 <Riastradh> Yaaargh!
18:21:51 <Riastradh> @arr
18:21:51 <Riastradh> @arr
18:21:52 <Riastradh> @arr
18:22:05 * Riastradh hurls a Kleisli triple at SyntaxLaptop!
18:22:25 * Arnia is not sure if (as a jackendovian) whether to be offended by blackdog
18:22:29 <blackdog> the purifying flame of destructive mutation be upon you!
18:22:30 <Pseudonym> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet.
18:23:08 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: does it at least run? :)
18:23:17 <Riastradh> No!  Reflect!
18:23:30 * Riastradh resets and shifts SyntaxLaptop.
18:23:37 * Arnia reifies himself in seagulland
18:23:55 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: Hang on.
18:24:04 * SyntaxLaptop backports Riastradh
18:24:11 <blackdog> Arnia: i'm only a poor program, and dreadfully badly educated... what does "jackendovian" mean?
18:24:24 <SyntaxLaptop> blackdog: the truth comes out! you are a program!
18:24:30 <blackdog> oh, get a room, people.
18:24:51 <blackdog> i'm the beerdrinking lambdaterm from oz.
18:25:57 <Arnia> blackdog: I am a subscriber to the linguistic research ideas of Ray Jackendoff (a non-syntactocentric development of Chomsky's generative grammars)
18:26:10 <Arnia> blackdog: References available upon request ;)
18:26:22 <Pseudonym> Ah, lambdabot has been GHC-onlyfied since I wrote it.
18:27:21 * Arnia rescinds lambdabot
18:27:29 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: Have you packaged hmake?
18:27:44 <blackdog> arnia: if you have something suitable for someone who dropped out of linguistics after second year, that'd be great.
18:28:17 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: no
18:28:32 <SyntaxLaptop> that's Igloo's territory
18:28:35 <Pseudonym> blackdog: I have a copy of Winograd's "Understanding Natural Language" sitting on my desk at the moment.  Want to rewrite SHRDLU in Haskell?
18:28:37 <Pseudonym> Ah.
18:28:41 * Pseudonym should get that
18:29:01 <Arnia> blackdog: 'Semantics and Cognition' Ray Jackendoff 1983
18:29:14 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: does it backport cleanly from the sources on haskell-experimental?
18:29:19 <Arnia> blackdog: 'Semantic Structures' Ray Jackendoff 1990
18:29:21 <SyntaxLaptop> I'm guessing not, since I think Igloo would have done it
18:29:39 <Arnia> blackdog: 'The Architecture of the Language Faculty' Ray Jackendoff 1997
18:29:49 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet.
18:29:55 <Pseudonym> Does what backport cleanly?
18:29:59 <Arnia> blackdog: 'HPSG' Pollard and Sag 1994
18:30:15 <Arnia> blackdog: 'Foundations of Language' Ray Jackendoff 2002
18:30:32 <Arnia> Nice starting points
18:31:00 <blackdog> Arnia: any cheater's guides? Just so I know enough to be able to slot a poorly caricatured version into my mental map?
18:31:12 <Smerdyakov> I would think a set of starting points ought to be smaller. :D
18:31:46 <Arnia> blackdog: All Jackendoff's works are very readable. He doesn't believe academia should be opaque. He's also a great email conversationalist
18:32:50 <Smerdyakov> And he looks good in a thong.
18:33:02 <Arnia> blackdog: The book that is best for bootstrapping the field is 'Foundations of Language' as it unifies much of the field (and associated studies such as cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, AI, philosophy etc)
18:33:17 <Arnia> Smerdyakov: Shhh... that threesome was meant to be secret
18:33:21 <Pseudonym> I'm also told he knows all the audience participation bits to the Rocky Horror Show.
18:33:45 <Arnia> Nah, that's me
18:33:59 <Riastradh> Arnia, bah!  Keep him away from this channel, then!
18:34:15 <Lor> When I learned HPSG, I sort of itched to give it a proper formalization and a type system. :)
18:34:22 <Riastradh> I spit the word 'eslupherum' at him!  *Ptooey*!
18:34:52 * Arnia throws rice at Pseudonym
18:35:18 <Arnia> Lor: It is a wonderfully typed system... Jackendoff even talks in those sorts of terms
18:35:51 <Lor> The way I've seen it represented isn't very, uh, formal. All trees and boxes and whatnot.
18:36:37 <Lor> And numeral identifiers for type variables...
18:37:25 <Pseudonym> Is wonderfully typing static or dynamic?
18:37:39 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, yes.
18:37:43 <Lor> If it's dynamic, it's not typing. :)
18:37:49 <Lor> Well, actually.
18:38:09 <Lor> Things get a bit less clear when type checking is made part of the operational rules of the language.
18:38:20 <Lor> Then there's no distinction between static and dynamic semantics.
18:38:36 <Riastradh> Haskell has an excuse for the infiltration of its type system into the language.  But not many other languages.
18:38:49 <Lor> What's haskell's excuse?
18:38:52 <Riastradh> (That excuse is category theory arcanity.)
18:38:59 <Lor> Um.
18:39:08 <Lor> The type system infiltrates mostly in the form of type classes, right?
18:39:26 <Lor> Besides those the types are pretty much erasable, I'd think.
18:39:40 <Riastradh> Shut up.  I'm just right, OK?
18:39:52 <Lor> Whatever. :)
18:39:54 <Pseudonym> Arrest that man, he speaks in Greek letters.
18:40:10 <Riastradh> Eslupherum!  Eslupherum!  Eslupherum!  Eslupherum!
18:41:33 <Arnia> Lor: Trees and boxes are formal... just another form of expression that is easier to understand. Feel free to properly type the expressions
18:44:05 <Lor> Probably will, once I have time to concentrate on linguistics.
18:44:35 <Lor> Gah, I want to get my cs degree done so I can do other things..
18:45:15 <Arnia> Lor: Hah, you're not the only one. At least my business is heavy on research so I can continue having fun
18:45:58 <Riastradh> Eslupherum!
18:46:18 <Smerdyakov> Lor, weren't you disparaging people who get their PhD's too early in life, a few weeks ago?
18:46:35 <Lor> Yes. I'm talking about MSc. :)
18:47:04 <Smerdyakov> Only smelly dinosaurs get MSc's in CS in the USA. :D
18:47:26 <Lor> Oh? What then?
18:47:47 <Smerdyakov> BS -> PhD
18:47:54 <Lor> Ah, right.
18:48:04 <Lor> BS? It's not written BSc?
18:48:09 <Smerdyakov> That's right.
18:48:15 <Smerdyakov> And we say MS, not MSc.
18:48:19 <Smerdyakov> Very efficient in ink savings.
18:48:51 <Lor> How's a bachelor of social sciences abbreviated?
18:48:58 <Pseudonym> It also shaves a whole byte.
18:49:11 <Smerdyakov> We don't have those.
18:49:13 <Riastradh> Wow!  A whole byte-sized piece!  Does that mean I get to eat tonight?
18:49:14 <Smerdyakov> We have BA, Bachelor of Arts.
18:49:53 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: There's a cheap joke in here somewhere about eating your words.  In your case, I suspect it wouldn't be pretty.
18:50:22 <Riastradh> My words are very tastily delicious.
18:50:30 <Lor> All right, the titles vary a bit. We make a distinction between humanistic and social sciences.
18:50:41 <Pseudonym> I don't know what eslupherum is, but I don't think I want to eat it.
18:50:53 <Riastradh> Politicians' words taste like feces.
18:51:10 <Pseudonym> More like hot air, surely?
18:51:18 <Arnia> BA, BSc, BEng, MSc, MA, MEng, MPhys, MMath, MChem, PhD, DD, DPhil and more... ugh... so many degrees titles to collect in the UK
18:51:30 <Pseudonym> Don't forget LLB.
18:51:35 <Pseudonym> One of my favourites.
18:51:40 <Riastradh> Inflated feces, by hot air.
18:52:03 <Lor> Anyway, hereabouts BSc (ha!) is a sort of "in-between" degree. It means you're well past the halfpoint on your way to a MSc, but if that remains your title, it can be interpreted a bit like "oh, so you left your studies unfinished".
18:52:22 <Pseudonym> Actually, one of the best ways to obfuscate a concept is to pick a random Greek preposition and append the suffix "-morphism".
18:52:23 <Lor> There's a big european renovation ongoing right now, after it BSc is supposed to become a "real" degree here, too.
18:52:34 <Riastradh> Eslupherumorphism!
18:52:45 <Arnia> LLB and LLM
18:52:53 <Lor> arnia, don't you have any licentiates?
18:53:48 <Arnia> Not really
18:54:04 <Pseudonym> I hereby invent antimorphisms.
18:54:24 <Arnia> animorphisms!
18:54:29 * Arnia begins collecting
18:54:31 <Pseudonym> OMG
18:54:36 <Pseudonym> Please.  No.
18:55:04 <Arnia> Hehe... trashy childrens fiction made into a programming concept
18:55:09 * Riastradh antimorphizes Arnia's animorphisms.
18:55:39 <SamB> what are animorphisms?
18:56:02 * Riastradh wonders that as well.
18:56:23 <SamB> and what are antimorphisms?
18:56:25 <Pseudonym> Actually, I like aneumorphism.  aneu == without
18:56:38 <Pseudonym> So it's kind of like the opposite of a -morphism.
18:56:39 <Lor> How about just morphomorphism?
18:56:52 <Pseudonym> morphos isn't a preposition.
18:57:06 <Lor> Bah.
18:57:23 <Arnia> diplomorphism
18:57:28 <Riastradh> Pseudomorphism.  Morphisnym.
18:57:45 <Pseudonym> Actually, I like "pseudomorphism".
18:57:58 <Pseudonym> That one sounds like it could be real.
18:58:11 <Riastradh> Pseudomorhpislupherunym.
18:58:14 <SamB> what are we naming here, anyway?
18:58:28 <Riastradh> Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosimorphism.
18:58:30 <Lor> Morphisms, of course.
18:58:36 <Pseudonym> SamB: We're trying to invent words first.  We'll attach them to concepts later.
18:58:54 <Riastradh> Concepts are for the weak who are unable to invent words.
18:59:01 <Pseudonym> Right on!
18:59:41 <Arnia> Reifying arrowdic processing (RAP)
18:59:41 <SamB> bah, wait until you find a concept and need a word for it!
18:59:42 <Riastradh> Word inventationism is the exercise of the truly scholarlistic populomorphism.
18:59:47 <Arnia> We RAP all day long...
19:00:12 <Pseudonym> That's RAP with a capital "C".
19:00:14 <Lor> reify is such a neat word.
19:00:22 <Pseudonym> reigy is good.
19:00:24 <Riastradh> Reifimorphism.
19:00:31 <Pseudonym> reify is too.
19:00:37 <Riastradh> Reiftradh.
19:00:42 <Lor> It's not greek, though.
19:00:50 <Pseudonym> Riamorphism.
19:00:50 <Riastradh> Eh, it's all Greek to me.
19:00:57 <Lor> Or is there some greek equivalent to "res"?
19:00:59 <Pseudonym> No, it's Latin, unfortunately.
19:01:06 <Pseudonym> lormorphism
19:01:12 <Riastradh> Lorphism.
19:01:14 <Pseudonym> Lor: What does it mean pr3ecisely?
19:01:21 <Pseudonym> In Latin.
19:01:21 <Riastradh> With a silent 3.
19:01:24 <SamB> Lor: well, eh, what does it matter what language its from?
19:01:26 <Riastradh> As in Hen3ry.
19:01:27 <Lor> "To make into a thing", I think.
19:01:42 <Pseudonym> I'll look it up.
19:01:45 <Riastradh> Morp3hism.
19:01:59 * Pseudonym is having a Neal Stephenson moment
19:03:44 * Lor thinks he is weak and now adopts the concept of sleep instead of inventing more words.
19:04:06 <Lor> What with the time being 5am and all...
19:04:12 <Pseudonym> Wimp.
19:04:37 <Pseudonym> Perseus is slow today.
19:04:38 <Arnia> 3 am ;)
19:05:02 * Arnia doesn't believe in timezones outside of GMT
19:24:29 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: to answer your question, does hmake backport cleanly
19:25:27 <Smerdyakov> 7:23 PM.
19:27:32 <SyntaxLaptop> I don't see the answer to my question back there, if that's what you're trying to tell me
19:41:22 <Pseudonym> I didn't try.
19:47:43 <SyntaxLaptop> didn't try to compile it on woody from the debian sources?
19:48:12 <Pseudonym> No.  Don't have time.
19:50:06 <SyntaxLaptop> ah.  well let me know if you need someone to walk you through it sometime.
