02:31:31 <harsha123> hello #haskell
02:31:37 <Eglin> hi
02:31:54 <harsha123> hi Eglin 
02:34:02 <harsha123> shapr hello!
02:42:25 <Eglin> ack!  all the links in the topic are busted
04:40:14 <TripleDES> hi
06:43:16 <saba> is lambdabot written in haskell? :)
06:47:28 <shapr> yes
06:48:48 <saba> thats very impressive. is there sourcecode for it that i could look at?
06:56:56 <dennisb> saba: look for lambdabot in google
06:57:05 <dennisb> there are not a lot of projects with that name
06:57:18 <saba> yeah, that /just/ occured to me :)
06:59:53 <dennisb> the link to it seems to be slow. shapr, what have you done with the server?
07:00:53 <shapr> ScannedInAvian.org is dead, hopefully shall return on monday
07:01:00 * saba nods sadly :)
07:01:03 <dennisb> connection refused even
07:01:03 <shapr> in the meantime...
07:01:25 <dennisb> shapr: that fully explains that I can't reach it :-)
07:01:31 <shapr> http://shapr.homelinux.net/~shae/lambdabot.tar.bz2
07:02:00 <saba> at my uni, there is a compulsary subject on 1st year algorithms, where the languages used exclusively are haskell and ocaml. i love them for that
07:02:13 <shapr> yah, that's a great way to learn algorithms
07:02:38 <saba> definately. next semester we get broken into the C method *groan*
07:04:20 <dennisb> the sad thing is that one probably don't see the greatness of a language like haskell before one have been forced to use a number of lesser ones
07:06:22 <saba> mmm, hugs all the way.
07:09:22 <maihem> ScannedInAvian is a cool domain name, any pictures?
07:10:09 <shapr> just pictures of me and my unicycle :-)
07:10:40 <maihem> none of a bird squashed against a glass screen?
07:10:58 <shapr> no, but you got the idea perfectly :-)
07:11:14 <maihem> Shame, I have a really funny image in my minds eye :)
07:11:18 <shapr> yah, me too
07:17:06 <maihem> google image search hasn't given me any joy yet :(
09:05:40 * shapr bounces
09:05:47 <Smerdyakov> Why?
09:05:57 <shapr> because life is exciting
09:06:11 <Smerdyakov> Better than "exiting," I guess.
09:06:15 <shapr> yup
09:12:47 <shapr> hej andersca 
09:12:54 <andersca> hej shapr
09:15:40 <shapr> any idea how I can get rid of the 'pin' priority that apt-listbugs is using?
09:31:43 <shapr> Igloo: did you see Sven Panne's critique of your GLCube.hs?
09:32:55 <shapr> he only had two minor notes, so it seems he approves of your code.
10:07:25 <fire_fire> hi guys
10:07:28 <fire_fire> anybody here?
10:07:44 <fire_fire> did anybody here use haskell in vs .net?
10:10:11 <CrewdenX> fire_fire: are you just talking about the ide?
10:17:51 <fire_fire> no
10:18:03 <fire_fire> there is a project for haskell on vs .net
10:21:13 <emu> haskell versus .net
10:21:16 <emu> sounds good
10:21:23 * emu bets on haskell

18:54:52 <jameson> Hi! I'm trying to build ghc 6.2 from the Debian source package with a working 6.0.1, but it refuses to build ghci by default (gives me a dynamic "not built for interactive use"). I forced it to spit out something, and now it can't find certain things like 'M.TypeQ' (deSugar/DsMeta.hs) during compilation.
18:54:57 <jameson> Any Ideas?
18:55:18 <jameson> (Is forcing ghci to be built by modifying the relevant Makefile to spit out -DGHCI a good idea at all?)
19:21:46 <Darius> jameson: You need a stage 1 compiler to build GHCi and Template Haskell.
19:23:53 <Darius> Riastradh: Considering the time of year, that either means not many #schemers have lives or not many celebrate Christmas (or other holiday's around this time of year).  Of course, this applies equally to the 50 people who are here ;)
19:24:20 * Darius knows he doesn't have a life and doesn't really care for Christmas or holidays in general.
19:25:19 <Riastradh> Darius, no, it was because more #haskell'ers use a bad Freenode server.
