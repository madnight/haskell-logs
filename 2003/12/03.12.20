01:31:35 <harsha123> am trying to get apt-get working with a debian repository on my local
01:31:35 <harsha123>             disk.. i have generated the Packages.gz file.. where should i
01:31:35 <harsha123>             place this file so that apt-get reads off this Packages.gz file
01:31:42 <harsha123> oops sorry! 
05:10:08 <ejt> hi, is there a prelude function to swap a pair of arguments over ?
05:10:26 <ejt> eg. \f a b -> f b a
05:12:54 <shapr> flip
05:12:56 <shapr> @type flip
05:12:56 <lambdabot> flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
05:13:15 <ejt> thx shapr, I was searching for 'swap' :)
05:43:18 <ca> can anyone better this: http://www2-data.informatik.unibw-muenchen.de/Lectures/WT2002/INF2/uebungen/permutations.hs
05:49:10 <det> haskell has tuples, yes ?
05:49:24 <ca> yeah
05:49:26 <andersca> det: yes
05:49:54 <det> maybe it would be better to go from [a] -> a list of tuples
05:50:45 <ca> det: maybe, but its not really convient to work with n sized tuples
05:55:36 <det> you dont want pairs like [1,1] or [2,2] ?
05:56:32 <ca> hmm, lists with duplicates? Not too worried about those
05:56:53 <det> I mean
05:57:57 <det> [1,2] with your code is (1,2) (2,1) thought maybe you wanted: (2,2),(2,1),(1,2),(1,1)
05:58:40 <ca> nope, just generating all the possible arrangements of the list
05:59:17 <det> ahh
06:23:06 <shapr> ca: there's a nice permutations in the sources for Rabhi and Lapalme's functional algorithms book
06:26:14 <ca> ok shapr, i'll look that up.. thanx
06:31:09 <ca> shapr: i found the src at http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/AlgoFP/code.html .. any ideas on what chapter i should start looking?
06:32:23 <shapr> I think it's in the beginning
06:32:25 <Smerdyakov> Whoa! ca has his own top level domain!
06:32:26 * shapr goes shopping
06:32:39 <Smerdyakov> shapr, I hope you are not buying Christmas gifts!
06:32:48 <ca> shapr: ah, i found it 
06:32:53 <ca> smerdy :D
06:34:01 <ca> hm, the algo here is almost exactly the same as the one i posted earlier
06:34:59 <ca> .. but still different enough, ty shapr
07:01:14 <det> Smerdyakov: and yet they rejected .det!
09:10:31 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: alive?
09:10:51 <Igloo> Yup
09:11:59 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: once I get some more of these haskell packages built for sparc, I'd like to get them uploaded to HE... how does one usually upload binary-only packages with dput?
09:12:31 <SyntaxLaptop> btw, I restarted mini-dinstall (again) and it looks like it went.
09:12:33 <Igloo> The same way as sourceful packages. Just dput haskell whatever.changes
09:12:41 <Igloo> Cool
09:13:04 * Igloo wonders what the bug is. If the daemon is dieing perhaps a cronjob to check and restart it would be good?
09:14:20 <SyntaxLaptop> that's a good idea.  there are some delicacies here because Colin, who wrote mini-dinstall, also manages that server for the most part ;)
09:14:30 <SyntaxLaptop> and I harass him about it, but it doesn't seem to have much effect.
09:14:48 <Igloo> Ah, right  :-)
09:15:13 <SyntaxLaptop> probabliy if I threaten an ugly hack like using a cron job to restart it, he'll do something about it :)
09:15:27 <Igloo> :-)
09:16:11 <SyntaxLaptop> so from your email "I don't think things should be being built 64-bit on Debian sparc." what do you mean?  It is a 64 bit machine, does gcc not do that for sparc?
09:16:52 <Igloo> AIUI Linux sparc uses 32-bit userspace
09:17:26 <SyntaxLaptop> you should follow-up to simon's ghc 6.2 announcement telling about the debian packages :-)
09:17:29 <Igloo> Did you try the deb to see if it built properly? It didn't seem to do anything special, though
09:17:43 <Igloo> I was hoping to have more than x86 debs before doing so  :-/
09:17:51 <SyntaxLaptop> debuild crapped out because of the error
09:18:46 <Igloo> Perhaps try building the 0.4 deb? That built OK on the buildd so we can see if it's a new problem or your machine?
09:19:20 <SyntaxLaptop> where can I get the source for that?
09:19:22 * Igloo goes to look at what configure has for sparc
09:19:49 <Igloo> Oh, I mean 0.5. http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/h/haddock/haddock_0.5.orig.tar.gz http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/h/haddock/haddock_0.5-4.dsc http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/h/haddock/haddock_0.5-4.diff.gz
09:22:20 * SyntaxLaptop builds 0.6 on i386 and 0.5 on sparc...
09:23:03 <SyntaxLaptop> hm. can't build 0.5 on sparc
09:23:33 <SyntaxLaptop> it's possible, though unlikely, that I'm having trouble w/ disk space
09:23:38 <Igloo> And you do have build-essential?
09:24:28 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah
09:24:46 <SyntaxLaptop> that sparc was my main machine for a while, so its hooked up
09:25:05 <SyntaxLaptop> I should delete my bloody mp3s
09:26:51 <Igloo> You could try comparing build log with http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=haddock&ver=0.5-4&arch=sparc&stamp=1063822755&file=log&as=raw
09:27:01 <Igloo> But ISTR you only got about 10 lines in
09:27:20 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah
09:28:11 <Igloo> Oh, try making it use gcc-2.95 as the C compiler (GHC should only be using that anyway)
09:28:36 <Igloo> ./configure --with-gcc=/usr/bin/gcc-2.95 should do it
09:30:23 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah, looks like that does it.
09:30:31 <SyntaxLaptop> should debian/rules do that?
09:31:26 <SyntaxLaptop> btw, I wouldn't wait for the autobuilders to come up before announcing to the mailing list :( but you might give the 3-line instructions for how to build from source if you're not on i386
09:32:16 <Igloo> Probably. I guess minimal build-deps+build-essential mean no other compiler gets installed
09:32:31 * Igloo suspects the build never actually uses gcc itself anyway
09:33:08 <Igloo> I was hoping the buildds that are up would build it at least. I'll send an e-mail to someone I think
09:33:38 <Igloo> Just wish I knew who the right person is for things like this
09:36:05 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah, i'm constantly confused by what is up and what is not.  I wish there were a table on a web page somewhere that lists all the services and their status :)
09:36:09 <SyntaxLaptop> I find it hard to keep track.
09:55:37 <SyntaxLaptop> btw, I added that flag to debian/rules and it built a perfect .deb
09:56:23 <Igloo> Cool
09:57:20 <SyntaxLaptop> building ghc6 now
09:57:50 <SyntaxLaptop> you're at 6.2-1, right?
09:58:38 <Igloo> Yup
15:23:24 <SyntaxLaptop> still building ghc...
15:24:16 <Igloo> :-)
15:24:23 <Igloo> What speed CPU do you have?
15:25:59 <Darius> Memory is the bigger worry unless you have plenty.
15:27:13 <SyntaxLaptop> I wanna say 500 Mhz (RISC)
15:28:20 * SyntaxLaptop goes for a run &
17:02:39 <maihem> I'm trying to convert the old HOpenGL planet.hs to the new API (in order to learn the API, I'm stuck on something though...
17:02:57 <maihem> reshape :: ReshapeCallback
17:02:57 <maihem> reshape Size w h = do return ()
17:03:15 <maihem> the compiler tells me     Couldn't match `IO ()' against `t -> t1'
17:03:16 <maihem>         Expected type: IO ()
17:03:16 <maihem>         Inferred type: t -> t1
17:04:21 <maihem> I would've thought that do return () is an IO () in this case, as required?
17:05:40 <SyntaxLaptop> you probably want reshape (Size w h) = return ()
17:06:54 <SyntaxLaptop> assuming that REshapeCalback has type (WhateverSizeTypeIs) -> IO ()
18:10:46 <maihem> thank you, I tried that and got a syntax error, must have mistyped :)
18:10:47 <maihem> yes
18:10:49 <maihem> it gets past that error now :)
18:11:56 <Darius> GHC all compiled now, SyntaxLaptop?
18:12:11 <SyntaxLaptop> Darius: no, ran out of space on the device :(
18:12:30 <SyntaxLaptop> backing up, deleting mp3s (i own them btw) and starting over
18:12:50 <SyntaxLaptop> but I'll use screen this time so I don't have to babysit it :)
18:13:23 <Igloo> :-)
18:15:56 <Darius> I guess it's less disappointing then getting an broken executable.
18:16:52 <SyntaxLaptop> I have faith that it'll build :)
18:17:55 <Darius> anyways, I'm going to watch a movie
18:17:59 <SyntaxLaptop> I've realized that if I'm running out of disk space 1) look for random versions of ghc code lying around, and 2) delete extra chroot partitions
18:18:18 <SyntaxLaptop> I'm hungry, but I want to wait for my bread to finish cooking, 1.5 hours
18:20:00 * Igloo is hoping I'll have a satisfactory ghc-cvs before I go to bed, and perhaps even a working ghc-spec-eval-cvs by tomorrow morning
19:03:18 * SyntaxLaptop outta here
