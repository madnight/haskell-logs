01:36:26 <shapr> g'morning
01:40:32 <shapr> yesterdays high-speed unplanned unicycle dismount resulted in five stitches on my knee.
01:41:16 <Rafterman> how does one acheive high speed on a unicycle?
01:41:24 <shapr> pedal really fast :-)
01:41:26 <Rafterman> I'm yet to get mine to go fast than a casual walking pace...
01:41:30 <Rafterman> heh, spose :)
01:41:49 <Cale> how can you really call it "unplanned" then?
01:42:00 <Cale> :)
01:42:11 <Marvin--> shapr: go you
01:42:27 <Marvin--> shapr: stitches in the knee is rarely fun
01:42:34 * Marvin-- knows this from personal experience
01:43:05 <Marvin--> hell I'll have this ugly scar on my knee for the rest of my life
01:48:29 <shapr`> arg
01:53:33 * Heffalump has one cut on his knee that didn't get stitches but is still a scar (from age 11)
01:53:50 <Heffalump> and another on my lower leg (other side) that did get stitches and is also still a scar
03:18:08 * shapr bounces (carefully)
03:18:17 <syntax-laptop> hi shapr
03:18:25 <shapr> hi syntax-laptop!!
03:18:41 <shapr> irc'ing across the room :-)
03:18:42 <syntax-laptop> so did you call the hotel yet?
03:18:46 <shapr> um, no.. not yet.
03:18:51 <shapr> I'm sure Marvin-- is waiting for me
03:19:12 <Marvin--> huh?
03:19:12 <shapr> hi Marvin--!
03:19:28 <syntax-laptop> hi Marvin--
03:26:09 <shapr> hi tez 
03:26:34 <Marvin--> what about me?
03:27:14 <shapr> I'm sposed to tell you about the hotel thingy
03:27:20 <Verbed> @yow
03:27:20 <lambdabot> Is this the line for the latest whimsical YUGOSLAVIAN drama which also
03:27:20 <lambdabot>  makes you want to CRY and reconsider the VIETNAM WAR?
03:27:23 <shapr> I'm just about to call them
03:33:06 <Marvin--> ... okay
03:33:12 * Marvin-- isn't following, but do go ahead :)
03:34:58 <shapr> oh shit
03:34:58 <shapr> I forgot to ask them about booking the cot
03:34:58 * shapr calls back
03:35:18 * Marvin-- slaps shapr on the forehead and shouts "D'OH!"
03:35:28 <shapr> yah, really
03:36:03 <shapr> which night was it again?
03:38:48 --- mode: clarke.freenode.net set +b flamer!*@*
03:38:56 --- mode: brunner.freenode.net set +b flamer!*@*
03:39:11 <shapr> and a laptop ;-)
03:39:13 --- mode: ChanServ set +o Heffalump
03:39:17 <Marvin--> well duh ;)
03:39:30 --- mode: Heffalump set -b flamer!*@*
03:40:02 <Heffalump> did I miss something about Marvin staying in Uppsala in the netsplit?
03:40:03 <Marvin--> at what time on the Wednesday will you guys be available?
03:40:13 <Marvin--> yes, I will be staying in Uppsala during the netsplit
03:40:14 <Heffalump> well, ICFP finishes at lunchtime IIRC
03:40:25 <Heffalump> cool, will you leave each time the netsplit ends?
03:40:31 <Marvin--> yep
03:41:28 <Marvin--> all right, the train tickets will cost me 500 SEK (~50 EUR)
03:41:44 <Marvin--> which isn't a lot, really
03:44:28 <Marvin--> all right, how about this? I'll arrive in Uppsala at 13.50 the 27th, and leave 16.30 the 28th
03:45:28 <Marvin--> comments?
03:45:54 <Marvin--> I guess you guys will be at HW all Thursday and have no chance to hang out more, but I might as well have a look around Uppsala too, since I've never been there
03:46:28 <Marvin--> anybody who doesn't bring a gpg fingerprint will pay for the beer ;)
03:46:51 <Marvin--> shapr: no comments?
03:46:55 * Marvin-- mutters
03:47:01 <shapr> I'll bring my gpg fingerprint!
03:47:02 <shapr> I promise!
03:47:31 <shapr> the in-person #haskell meeting hopefully won't suffer from any netsplits
03:47:46 <shapr> maybe we'll have loud construction instead :-)
03:47:51 <o3> shapr: if it does, i think there are other things to worry about
03:48:08 <Marvin--> all right, these trains it is
03:48:11 * Marvin-- hits the "OK" button
03:48:19 <shapr> o3: like, why are these geeks showing up in-person to get on irc and chat?
03:49:12 <Marvin--> or would, if I didn't have to change batteries in my mouse
03:49:18 * shapr grins
03:49:30 <shapr> that's what mouse tails are for, external power.
03:50:25 * Marvin-- has no idea what a "PC seat" is, but figures "what the heck"
03:50:35 <o3> a seat for your PC, obviously
03:50:42 <shapr> politically correct?
03:50:51 <shapr> you can't sit there if old ladies are standing up next to you?
03:51:06 <Marvin--> it doesn't cost anything extra, I wonder why all seats aren't "PC seats"
03:51:14 <shapr> not allowed to make disparaging comments about skåne natives from that seat?
03:51:21 <o3> Marvin--: "Perfectly Comfortable (really, they are)"
03:51:35 <Marvin--> heh
03:52:16 <Marvin--> bah, they actually were out of PC seats, they just didn't want to tell me until I hit the OK button
03:52:50 <Marvin--> GAH, and actually, they didn't have any PC seats in any direction, but of course I have to press OK twice and it first tells me that they don't have any to Stockholm, and then next time that "oh btw, we don't have any to GÃ¶teborg either"
03:53:05 <shapr> lovely
03:53:57 <Marvin--> ah well, now I'll get the tickets and a bill tomorrow or the day after :)
03:54:06 <Marvin--> yay, this is going to be a blast
03:54:39 <shapr> yah, I agree!
03:54:42 * shapr bounces carefully
03:55:01 <shapr> I'm sposed to have the stitches out in a week
03:55:07 <shapr> I guess I'll wait till after HIM
03:55:20 <Marvin--> no problems to walk around?
03:55:38 <shapr> I walk a bit funny at the moment
03:55:42 <shapr> hopefully that won't last too long
03:55:43 <o3> singapore airlines has a ridiculous number of ways to check in
03:55:46 <Marvin--> when I hit my knee it hurt like hell
03:56:07 <Marvin--> er, s/hit/hurt/
03:56:28 <shapr> my hurts some, but it doesn't bother me so much
03:57:40 <shapr> hey, since we're having a #haskell get-together
03:57:59 * Marvin-- is just a wuss, I guess
03:58:20 <shapr> I wonder if I should mention it on haskell@h.o and invite any haskell interested ICFP attendees to show up
03:58:23 <shapr> what do you think?
03:58:50 <Marvin--> Actually, I don't think so
03:58:55 <shapr> ok
03:59:05 <Marvin--> since it's a #haskell get-together, not a Haskell get-together
03:59:08 <Heffalump> yeah.
03:59:08 <shapr> that's true
03:59:27 <shapr> hey, is andersca showing up for that one night?
03:59:34 * shapr pokes andersca 
04:00:33 <shapr> hey, we've picked the same night as the ICFP banquet
04:00:52 <Marvin--> are any of you attending it?
04:01:07 * shapr shrugs
04:01:31 <shapr> I'd rather go to the #haskell get-together
04:02:00 <Marvin--> it is the best time since we have the whole afternoon and evening, but it sucks if half of you are going to the banquet
04:02:30 <Heffalump> oh, I forgot about that
04:02:41 <Heffalump> yeah, I'm going to it, I guess
04:02:50 <Heffalump> Igloo won't be
04:02:56 <Marvin--> I just ordered my train tickets, damn you :-(
04:03:23 <shapr> Marvin--: I bet we can get you into the banquet :-)
04:03:33 <shapr> it's $25 to order extra banquet tickets on the website
04:03:35 <Heffalump> none of the students will have tickets, probably
04:03:44 <Heffalump> oh, is that all?
04:03:49 <shapr> yah
04:03:51 <Marvin--> I don't even know if I want to
04:03:53 <Heffalump> in that case skipping it won't make me feel like I'm wasting much money :-)
04:03:57 <Marvin--> I'd rather hit a pub
04:04:43 <shapr> yah, beer and #haskell
04:14:58 <Marvin--> ooh, gdeskcal is neato
04:15:37 <andersca> shapr: may be too busy with school :/
04:18:11 <Marvin--> shapr: andersca means that he will be too busy drinking the freshmen under the table
04:18:28 <andersca> more like they'll be drinking me under the table
04:18:35 <Marvin--> how's it going?
04:18:46 <andersca> pretty good so far
04:19:34 <Marvin--> what's happening tonight?
04:19:44 * Marvin-- feels like having a beer
04:20:00 <andersca> going to slottsskogen
04:20:00 <andersca> the singing pub is tomorrow
04:20:17 <Marvin--> oh dear, let me guess, Feliks is doing that?
04:20:20 <andersca> yes
04:20:30 <Marvin--> well, tomorrow night I'm busy
04:20:46 * Marvin-- liked the horror trip through slottsskogen last year
04:59:18 <shapr> andersca: you could show up just for the evening
04:59:41 <shapr> or afternoon
05:15:57 <Marvin--> shapr: it's still a four hour train trip
05:16:02 <shapr> oh
05:16:17 <shapr> yah, that is a ways off
05:16:34 <Marvin--> I'm only doing it 'cause I'm crazy ;)
05:16:37 <shapr> heh
05:16:40 <shapr> I think it'll be fun
05:16:43 <Marvin--> so do I
05:16:45 <shapr> bring a laptop, we'll hack
05:39:36 * shapr bounces excitedly
05:40:00 <shapr> hey silly question, is it okay to wear faded jeans and a geeky tshirt to icfp?
05:40:19 * Marvin-- sure hopes so ;)
05:40:26 <Marvin--> shapr: not if you're going to the banquet, I think :)
06:32:18 --- mode: niven.freenode.net set +o Heffalump
06:40:54 <Marvin--> http://www.dynom.nl/stuff/though_question/
06:42:40 <Heffalump> people tend to wear all sorts to the banquet too
06:42:43 <Heffalump> though many people dress up a bit more
06:43:00 <Marvin--> "banquet" sounds pretty formal to me
06:43:22 <Heffalump> in practice it's not usually hugely so
06:43:43 <Heffalump> nobody would really notice or care what you were wearing. I tend to wear a (casual) shirt and trousers
06:46:34 <Marvin--> well
06:47:02 <Marvin--> seeing as the only "conference dinner" I've been to was during debconf which was as informal as it gets ;)
06:54:46 <Heffalump> :-)
07:03:03 <Marvin--> I really wonder what the regulations are on import for private consumption
07:03:15 <Marvin--> well, s/consumption/usage/ or whatever
07:05:52 <Marvin--> like, what kind of duties and taxes and crap do I have to pay, and are there any limits depending on the value of the goods, et.c.
07:07:34 <Heffalump> to do what?
07:09:16 <Marvin--> I realized that the Game of Thrones card boxes we buy here cost roughly 110 EUR, while in the US, they cost roughly $70
07:23:02 <d33p> does anyone know of a haskell shell.. would it make sense to have one?
07:23:18 <Heffalump> I've heard of one
07:23:22 <Heffalump> not sure how far it got
07:23:30 <d33p> i see 
07:23:36 <d33p> would be pretty cool :)
07:25:02 <Marvin--> I guess the haskell operating system could use a haskell shell when it comes around :)
07:25:17 <d33p> yes!
07:25:19 <d33p> so why dont we write one
07:25:32 <Heffalump> a Haskell shell would be good.
07:26:26 <d33p> what would it require - a new haskell 98 implementation?
07:27:00 <Heffalump> I reckon extending GHCi appropriately would be the way to go
07:27:22 <d33p> okay
07:28:27 <d33p> what kind of extensions are we talking about?
07:29:46 <Heffalump> not entirely sure.
07:30:08 <Heffalump> or maybe start from the dynamic loader rather than the full majesty of GHCi
07:30:34 <Heffalump> you'd need to first work out what kind of UI you want
07:31:12 <Heffalump> to be usable, it should probably be as similar to the usual basic shell functions as possible
07:31:33 <d33p> hmm
07:31:46 <d33p> yeah, those are just features
07:31:50 <d33p> you could add those as you go
07:32:04 <d33p> stuff like tab completion, wildcards etc 
07:32:25 <Heffalump> yeah
07:32:41 <Marvin--> then I wonder what the purpose of writing it in Haskell is :) if it's not going to be different, why bother?
07:32:44 <Heffalump> the main point is that the usual GHCi prompt couldn't sensibly be extended to do it, because that's for evaluating Haskell code
07:33:01 <Heffalump> Marvin--: the main reason would be that you'd want easy access to be able to evaluate Haskell
07:33:13 <d33p> we could take a look at what scsh does.. and how well it works in practise
07:33:21 <Heffalump> which is why I suggested basing it on GHCi or the dynamic loader
07:34:41 <d33p> (its the scheme shell)
07:34:47 <d33p> http://www.scsh.net/
07:38:21 <d33p> should it be written in haskell?
07:41:01 * shapr boings
07:42:40 <shapr> Hsh.hs comes with GHC sources
07:42:51 <shapr> it's tiny
07:43:02 <shapr> combining it with the runtime loader would be a blast
07:43:30 <d33p> there isnt a ghc package for my distro :\
07:44:45 <Heffalump> what distro?
07:44:59 <o3> linux-from-scratch? :D
07:45:07 <d33p> sourcemage
07:45:30 <Marvin--> never heard of
07:45:47 <d33p> its not really popular
07:46:12 <d33p> did you hear of sorcery sometime last year? Its a fork of that, basically 
07:46:22 <Heffalump> best make your own package then :-)
07:46:31 <d33p> looks that way :)
07:48:08 <Marvin--> can't say I've heard of sorcery either
07:48:19 <shapr> Igloo: idle question, do you think parts of GHC could be switched to using array ops so they could use Chilli's NDP code?
07:48:38 <shapr> I was thinking of hOp on SMP :-)
07:49:14 <d33p> Marvin--: oh, it was on slashdot and stuff.. one of the earlier sourcebased distros (like gentoo)
07:49:59 <Heffalump> shapr: I suspect not.
07:51:09 <shapr> too bad
07:51:10 <shapr> tyvarr
07:54:05 <d33p> shapr: thats a pretty simple shell..  
07:54:12 <shapr> yes it is
07:54:24 <d33p> okay, thats cool
07:54:33 <shapr> Igloo wrote an ls clone in Haskell
07:55:22 <d33p> well, a simple application of popen() should cover that 
07:55:45 <d33p> popen on /usr/bin/ls and use some haskell function to turn that into a list of strings 
07:56:52 <d33p> i guess i should get ghci somehow, and start playing with this for ideas
07:57:58 <d33p> that would work in general, for any app in the path 
07:58:08 <d33p> iam assuming Hsh.hs does that already
07:59:06 <Heffalump> the point of what Igloo does was that he reimplemented it in haskell
07:59:09 <Heffalump> s/does/did/
07:59:11 <shapr> yah
07:59:23 <Heffalump> but for a real shell, you'd expect to just run the binary
07:59:29 <Heffalump> what's the standard way shells run binaries?
07:59:54 <d33p> hmm, they run the command in a child process
08:00:15 <shapr> ooohh
08:00:23 <d33p> fork() exec()
08:00:23 <shapr> There's support for more fine-grained distinctions now.  We hav
08:00:23 <shapr> 	-fffi
08:00:23 <shapr> 	-fglasgow-exts
08:00:23 <shapr> 	-farrows
08:00:23 <shapr> 	-fparr		(Manuel's parallel array stuff)
08:00:27 * shapr bounces
08:00:30 <d33p> i think  :s
08:00:46 <o3> -farrows?  nice
08:00:53 <Heffalump> cool.
08:00:58 <shapr> doesn't seem to be in 6.0.1
08:01:01 <Heffalump> yes, people are trying to push the GHC people there
08:01:03 <shapr> -fparr is though
08:01:08 <Heffalump> it'll be in 6.2 AIUI
08:01:17 <shapr> spiffy
08:01:42 <shapr> the time for Haskell2 approaches
08:01:43 <shapr> hi hal
08:01:45 <hdaume> morning folks
08:01:57 <shapr> seems they're adding -fth
08:02:09 <Heffalump> shapr: err, yeah, if someone will actually do it...
08:02:11 <Heffalump> hi hdaume
08:02:20 * hdaume really wants -fno-th :)
08:02:27 <Heffalump> hehe
08:02:49 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-all/2003-June/027947.html
08:02:57 <shapr> -farrows yay!
08:03:21 <shapr> oh, I hadn't seen -<< >>- (| |) 
08:04:03 <shapr> rec is mdo for arrows?
08:04:09 <shapr> seems so
08:04:44 <o3> shapr: obviously {| |} will have to be the next syntax additions :)
08:04:50 <o3> then <| |> ...
08:04:58 <o3> then maybe the spaceship operator ...
08:05:51 <shapr> sharp object operator O====I:::::::>
08:06:33 <shapr> I think /> is used in HXMLToolbox and one of the other HTML generation libs
08:07:45 <shapr> cool shades operator OO¬
08:15:37 <shapr> ah, HIM info updated
08:15:42 <shapr> it's 300SEK
08:16:20 <hdaume> ...is that a lot?
08:18:36 <shapr> thirty bucks
08:18:43 <hdaume> ah
08:19:04 <shapr> it's actually 9SEK to 1USD, but divide by ten is the rule of thumb
08:19:49 <shapr> the HIM program looks like fun
08:22:07 <Heffalump> what's the URL again?
08:22:19 <shapr> http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/nilsson/HIM/
08:22:38 <shapr> I want to emphasize haskell in business
08:27:11 <shapr> I just remembered the nurse told me to stick with two wheels for awhile :-)
08:27:21 * d33p names his haskell shell - Hash :p
08:27:44 <Heffalump> :-)
08:27:45 <shapr> d33p: want write access to hlibs, the darcs cvs-wiki?
08:27:46 <Heffalump> are you writing one then?
08:28:23 <d33p> shapr: thanks that'd be great.. but i am gonna design it first 
08:28:36 <d33p> Heffalump: yep 
08:28:49 <Heffalump> cool.
08:29:02 <Heffalump> do you have a vague plan?
08:29:30 <d33p> Heffalump: yeah i have some ideas 
08:41:01 <shapr> lambdabot: @yow
08:41:01 <lambdabot> It's strange, but I'm only TRULY ALIVE when I'm covered in POLKA DOTS
08:41:01 <lambdabot>  and TACO SAUCE...
08:41:07 <shapr> lambdabot: @listmodules
08:41:07 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]
08:41:19 <shapr> lambdabot: @listcommands dummy
08:41:19 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy"]
08:45:00 <o3> why's there a dummy module?
08:45:20 <Heffalump> cos I wrote it while testing dynamic loading
08:45:31 <Heffalump> and intend to continue using it to test that if I do any more work on it
08:45:51 <Heffalump> it's also a good skeleton for starting work on your own module (though "hello" fits that bill too)
08:48:50 <o3> ah
08:50:26 <Lunar^>   Heffalump : Do you think that writing lambdabot modules could be an exercise for a course ?
08:51:26 <Heffalump> err, what kind of course?
08:51:46 <Heffalump> I don't really see why doing that is any better than just making them write a program from the ground up
08:53:08 <Lunar^> might entertain them maybe
08:53:20 <Lunar^> doing something they could easily show to other students
08:53:34 <Lunar^> (especially those not doing fp stuff ;)
08:53:40 <Heffalump> if they're already IRC oriented people, I guess
08:53:45 <Heffalump> if not it'll all seem rather pointless
08:54:07 <Lunar^> I'll see with them then
08:54:10 <Heffalump> do you actually have a course in mind to use it in?
08:56:37 <Lunar^> Heffalump: not exactly... I'm still wondering how am I going to use my 37.5 hours
08:57:06 <Heffalump> 37.5 hours?
08:57:29 <Lunar^> yes
08:57:59 <Heffalump> of what?
08:58:44 <Lunar^> "Functionnal programming", it's for second year (in a 5 year cursus)
08:58:56 * Lunar^ feel he's lacking vocabulary
08:59:05 <Smerdyakov> Only one 'n' in "functional".
08:59:22 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, I think I understand what you mean, even if you lack vocabulary. :-)
08:59:40 <Heffalump> you're giving a course that that lasts 37.5 teaching hours?
08:59:46 <Heffalump> that's the bit I was missing :-)
09:00:24 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: In french you write "fonctionnel".. I miss it often ;)
09:00:41 <Lunar^> Heffalump: ok :)
09:00:58 <Heffalump> and these are CS students?
09:02:20 <Lunar^> Heffalump: yes.. they will have a Delphi 1 year background
09:02:41 <Lunar^> Heffalump: I'm waiting for my copy of Hudak's SOE, think it'll help
09:02:49 <shapr> yah, it's great
09:03:00 <Heffalump> how smart are they?
09:03:01 <shapr> I think SOE is the best I've seen.
09:03:18 <Lunar^> Heffalump: dunno.. but it's a small group (25 people I think)
09:03:56 <Lunar^> found "the craft of functional programming" lately, but it was damnly expensive (60 euros+)
09:08:35 <shapr> I learned from 'craft'
09:08:53 <shapr> I had trouble with SOE because it required more math than I have.
09:09:08 <shapr> not that it requires very much :-)
09:11:31 <Lunar^> I got really really low maths level, hope that I will be able to go through anyway
13:52:01 <hdaume> quiet here today :)
13:52:07 <jak> :)
13:54:28 <jak> if I say (from the Monad's tutorial): type ParseMonad = Either ParseError
13:54:43 <jak> is that the same as: type ParseMonad a = Either ParseError a
13:55:08 <jak> and if so, does that mean that I can use ParseError as a type-constructor irrespective of whether I put the a in the type or not?
13:55:09 <Smerdyakov> I don't think so.
13:55:35 <Smerdyakov> Either has different kinds between those two.
13:55:42 <Heffalump> you can't partially apply type constructors unless you use GHC-specific extensions
13:55:53 <jak> I'm looking at the Error monad example at http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/errormonad.html
13:56:13 <Heffalump> oh, you can do it in instance declarations
13:56:19 <Heffalump> sorry, I think I meant type synonyms above
13:56:30 <jak> ah
13:56:49 <hdaume> no it's not

14:14:53 <hdaume> the difference is that you cannot partially apply /type synonyms/...you can partially apply data types to your heart's content
14:15:44 <hdaume> oh, i see heff corrected himself
14:15:45 <hdaume> nm :)
14:23:16 <hdaume> anyone care to point me in the direction of a not very theoretical, but highly practical (i.e., with not made up examples) paper on arrows?  i'm esp. insterested in ways in which they both consume and supercede monads (from a practical perspective).
14:24:43 <Heffalump> have you tried John Hughes' paper?
14:24:52 <hdaume> which one?  i think probably a long time ago...
14:24:53 <Darius> as well as Yampa
14:25:07 <Darius> I haven't seen too many contrived examples using arrows.
14:25:09 <Heffalump> or Ross Paterson's chapter in FOP
14:25:17 <Heffalump> hdaume: well, the SCP one (or the draft on his webpage)
14:25:22 <Heffalump> I didn't know he'd written any others
14:25:34 <hdaume> i'll take a look
14:25:42 <Heffalump> http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/errormonad.html
14:25:44 <Heffalump> sorry
14:25:46 <Heffalump> paste broken
14:25:48 <hdaume> :)
14:25:50 <hdaume> i found it
14:26:21 <Heffalump> 10.2 of Ross's chapter explains how the supercede monads
14:52:34 <jak> 'night
15:02:55 <shapr> bah, I have to buy FoP to read Ross's chapter.
15:03:02 <hdaume> why?
15:03:08 <shapr> oh, is it online?
15:03:10 <Heffalump> yeah
15:03:11 <hdaume> yeah
15:03:18 <shapr> oh!
15:03:23 <Heffalump> I should put our chapter online.
15:03:34 <shapr> aha
15:03:35 <Heffalump> though I'm not sure if Oege would prefer to encourage sales :-)
15:03:55 <shapr> I'll buy it anyway :-)
15:04:06 <shapr> probably before Okasaki too
15:05:56 * hdaume wishes IPs could be bound in statements
15:06:35 <hdaume> i.e., do { foo ; let ?barf = barf ; something_that_uses_?barf ; something_else_that_uses_?barf }
15:06:42 <shapr> SyntaxPolice just beat me at Munchkin
15:07:00 <shapr> and his girlfriend Anna won at Set
15:07:10 <andersca> munchkin!
15:07:21 <shapr> andersca: see, you really should show up ;-)
15:07:28 * shapr tries to bribe andersca to come to Uppsala
15:08:49 <Marvin--> Set?
15:08:56 <Marvin--> Munchkin rules
15:09:09 <andersca> yeah
15:09:16 <Marvin--> I hope you're remembering to mention that you're kicking in the door every time you draw a card, it's very important
15:09:27 <andersca> of course
15:09:34 <shapr> setgame.com
15:09:51 <shapr> andersca: come play munchkin in uppsala with the #haskell people!
15:10:12 <shapr> we even have the expansion, unnatural axe
15:10:36 <Marvin--> looks complicated
15:10:44 <Marvin--> Set, that is
15:10:56 <andersca> shapr: I've played with that expansion, it's cool
15:10:58 * Marvin-- won a few games of Space Munchkin at gothcon
15:11:10 <andersca> shapr: can't come to uppsala, need to take care of new students :/
15:11:16 <shapr> andersca: okay ;-/
15:11:23 <Marvin--> when we play regular Munchkin it usually gets out of hand as soon as someone gets the Thief though, everybody hate the Thief :-)
15:11:38 <shapr> hah, someone asked on ll1 list what books Guy Steele had written forewords for...
15:11:45 <shapr> so he posted the full list
15:11:51 <shapr> I didn't know he was on this list.
15:11:56 <Marvin--> heh
15:12:25 <shapr> yes, the thief is the coolest card in munchkin
15:12:32 <shapr> steal everything, lose levels, get crazy
15:12:43 <shapr> the kneepads of allure turn our games from vicious to pure evil
15:12:52 <Marvin--> yeah, that one's scary
15:12:55 <andersca> yeah
15:13:13 <shapr> anyways, I gotta sleep, trying to keep my schedule sane ...
15:13:17 <Marvin--> should I bring games? Is that what you're saying? :)
15:13:17 <andersca> :)
15:13:19 <shapr> icfp starts at 8:30am!
15:13:23 <shapr> insanity...
15:13:30 <shapr> Marvin--: sounds like fun to me
15:13:36 * Marvin-- has Hacker
15:13:37 <shapr> I dunno what sort of games are pub-safe
15:13:47 <Marvin--> definitely not Hacker :)
15:14:01 <Marvin--> nor is Drakon or Nodwick
15:14:15 <shapr> haven't heard of those
15:15:05 <Marvin--> Drakon is a fun game where you build the dungeon as you're walking through it, almost every damn room has a special effect that you use when you enter it
15:15:33 <shapr> sounds cool
15:16:35 <Marvin--> Nodwick is a veeerry hectic game which has as objective to reconstruct your henchman from parts, using duct tape, happy thoughts, power of the gods et.c.
15:16:49 <Marvin--> have you read the comic?
15:17:31 <Marvin--> www.nodwick.com, very fun if you're into roleplaying
15:22:19 <shapr> oh I know this cartoon!
15:22:26 <shapr> I read dragon magazine all the time
15:22:28 <shapr> long ago.
15:22:39 <Marvin--> :)
15:26:01 <Marvin--> I think they have all the old strips around too
15:27:43 * shapr falls over asleep
15:35:24 * Cale too, seeing as I've been up for more than 30 hours.
