00:00:16 * shapr boings
00:00:24 <shapr> so, anything happen while I was gone?
00:00:26 <whee> shapr: lambdabot is complicated, fix it
00:00:28 <whee> :)
00:01:44 <shapr> whee: what's complicated about it?
00:02:08 <whee> I was just having trouble following all the monads; there's hardly any type signatures :|
00:04:33 <Darius> EvalModule is full of type signatures, but I can't say that it actually helps in that case though.  In my local version, phiLambda has a type 8 lines long.
00:04:41 <Darius> (formatted)
00:16:05 <shapr> wow, lambdabot had a stack overflow when it crashed
00:16:10 <shapr> I wonder what happened
00:17:31 <shapr> whee: you should really use the darcs repo
00:17:44 <shapr> that's the master repo unless darcs breaks horribly
00:20:59 <shapr> @yow
00:21:00 <lambdabot> My Aunt MAUREEN was a military advisor to IKE & TINA TURNER!!
00:21:01 <heffalambda> Mmmmmm-MMMMMM!!  A plate of STEAMING PIECES of a PIG mixed
00:21:01 <heffalambda>  with the shreds of SEVERAL CHICKENS!!...  Oh BOY!!  I'm
00:21:01 <heffalambda>  about to swallow a TORN-OFF section of a COW'S LEFT LEG
00:21:01 <heffalambda>  soaked in COTTONSEED OIL and SUGAR!!  ..  Let's see..
00:21:01 <heffalambda>  Next, I'll have the GROUND-UP flesh of CUTE, BABY LAMBS
00:21:03 <heffalambda>  fried in the MELTED, FATTY TISSUES from a warm-blooded
00:21:05 <heffalambda>  animal someone once PETTED!!  ...  YUM!!  That was GOOD!!
00:21:08 <heffalambda>  For DESSERT, I'll have a TOFU BURGER with BEAN SPROUTS
00:21:10 <shapr> scary
00:21:13 <shapr> but fun
00:22:47 <whee> darcs?
01:01:20 <whee> would it be reasonably safe to use unsafePerformIO on an IO String returned by reading a file?
01:01:29 <whee> (it's read once at the start of the program, and never again)
01:27:47 * shapr boings
01:28:36 <whee> well, this isn't crashing so I'm going to assume it's safe :)
01:30:02 * Heffalump appears
01:30:31 <Heffalump> shapr: shall I kill heffalambda so you can bring back lambdabot?
01:30:44 <Heffalump> whee: the general consensus on the Haskell list is that it's reasonably safe
01:32:00 <whee> I'm porting one of my old old programs (originally written in perl) to haskell :|
01:32:04 <whee> lots of fun
01:32:08 <Heffalump> whee: lovely :-)
01:38:50 <shapr> Heffalump: sure
01:39:07 <shapr> I wonder why lambdabot died
01:39:18 <Heffalump> how was HIM?
01:39:37 <shapr> it was spiffy
01:40:26 <shapr> I think they'll be inviting more people next year though
01:40:30 <Heffalump> heh
01:41:12 <shapr> there was some discussion whether the invitation-only part should be changed
01:41:48 <shapr> consensus was that the word of mouth transitive closure bit was best
01:41:59 <whee> gah; has anyone used the Text.Regex module? :|
01:41:59 <shapr> and that there may be half-year HIM meetings here on #haskell
01:42:42 <shapr> SPJ suggested that I write up a simpler intro doc for complete irc newbies so that ICFP/HIM attendees could make the jump to #haskell
01:42:50 <whee> I'm getting "Fail: Text.Regex.Posix.regcomp: error in pattern" and wondering if anyone has a clue how to catch and handle that
01:43:21 <whee> I tried the catch/handle functions in Control.Exception, but that didn't seem to catch anything
01:43:35 <shapr> SPJ took off his sweater and sandals at HIM, ran around with his shirt half-untucked, it was *really* informal
01:43:44 <shapr> Leon was our most vociferous speaker.
01:44:08 <Heffalump> shapr: what GHC version?
01:44:11 <Heffalump> shapr: :-)
01:44:20 <Heffalump> s/shapr/whee/
01:44:25 <Heffalump> in my first line
01:44:27 <whee> Heffalump: 6.0.1
01:44:32 <Heffalump> shapr: I guess Leon was getting fed up of talks
01:44:43 <shapr> yah, I think he wanted more action, less talking.
01:44:57 <Heffalump> whee: can you put your code online?
01:45:11 <shapr> Heffalump: do you know how old Leon is?
01:45:16 <Heffalump> 4 months, IIRC
01:45:16 <whee> eeh, it's rather ugly
01:45:29 <Heffalump> whee: I've written Perl myself, I'm sure I'll forgive you :-)
01:45:38 <whee> well this is haskell code :)
01:45:51 * Heffalump has no idea about Text.Regex btw, but would like to work out why your catches are failing
01:46:00 <shapr> oh yah, I remember he was born the day before the ICFP (or maybe HW?) submission date
01:46:57 <whee> let me try one more thing 
01:47:31 <Heffalump> I suspect the ICFP date
01:54:05 <whee> I think my usage of handle would be doing this
01:54:34 <whee> if I'm doing handle (\e -> return $ Left e) (return $ Right $ someFunctionThatMayFail), would the lazy evalulation part potentially cause a problem?
01:54:56 <whee> err, add a \blah -> on the latter
02:05:17 <Heffalump> what happens when you make someFunctionThatMayFail an immediate error call?
02:06:24 <whee> fails in the same way, not going through the handler :\
02:07:20 <Heffalump> where does the \blah -> go?
02:07:37 <whee> er, wait, there is none
02:10:31 <Heffalump> yes, the problem is the laziness
02:10:43 <Heffalump> you don't do anything that demands evaluation of the error value inside the module, I guess
02:11:27 <whee> this function is just a wrapper to compiling a String to a Regex; it's just the handle expression
02:11:34 <whee> the actual Regex gets used elsewhere
02:11:51 <Darius> try evaluate (also see the try function)
02:12:41 <whee> heh, this does look like I rewrote try with this handle
02:14:40 <whee> try . evaluate $ someFunction did appear to work, thanks
02:19:23 <Darius> you probably don't need evaluate if you use try.
02:21:30 <whee> well, this function returns a Regex type, and try wants something returning IO
02:21:47 <whee> and using return has the same lazy evaluation problem
02:25:30 <Darius> your right, I wasn't thinking
02:52:12 <Igloo> Morning all
02:52:30 <Heffalump> morning
02:54:42 <whee> hola
02:55:23 <Heffalump> it moves!
03:42:37 <whee> what's the easy way to take a [String] and turn it into a String with comma delimiters?
03:43:44 <Igloo> concat . intersperse ","
03:43:54 * ibid would have tried fold :)
03:44:40 <whee> gah, I've never used intersperse or even known about it :|
03:56:13 <pesco> If nothing else, intersperse is why Haskell beats C.
03:56:32 <Igloo> :-)
04:18:44 <mattam> @proto intersperse
04:18:44 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "proto", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
04:18:52 <mattam> @listcommands
04:18:53 <lambdabot> I react to the following commands: ["all-dicts","define","definitions","del-definition","devils","dict","dict-help","dummy","dump","dynamic-load","dynamic-reload","dynamic-unload","easton","echo","elements","eval","foldoc","fortune","gazetteer","get-definition","goodbye","hello","hitchcock","jargon","join","karma","karma+","karma-","leave","listchans","listcommands","listmodules","lojban","more","msg","part","prelude","quit","reconnect","
04:19:07 <ibid> @prelude intersperse
04:19:10 <lambdabot> *** "intersperse" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
04:19:10 <lambdabot> intersperse

04:19:14 <mattam> right
04:20:14 <mattam> hmmm, caml doesn't have that one
04:24:31 <whee> ocaml doesn't have a lot of the fun haskell list functions
04:49:34 <pseiko> hi folks
04:51:29 <pseiko> i have a new idea :-) does somebody know the vitutor? I am wondering if it would be possible, to hack a useful interactive Haskell-Tutor, what do you think about this?
04:51:51 <pseiko> Or is there already something like this in the www?
04:58:46 <Cale> I don't think that something like that already exists, though you'll likely want to look at Helium.
05:07:55 <pseiko> helium seems not to be haskell98
05:08:20 <pseiko> the tutor should at least tell the newbie something about type classes :-)
05:19:29 <shapr> oy
05:19:54 <shapr> wassup?
05:20:17 * andersca gaboings
05:23:16 * shapr biffs
05:23:23 <shapr> I'm way tired
05:23:24 <andersca> how was the conference?
05:23:42 <shapr> train from Stockholm arrived in Boden this morning at 7:30am
05:24:30 <shapr> conference was fun, lots of follow-up stuff I need to do
05:24:45 <shapr> like... sleep
05:25:35 <shapr> anything exciting happen on the channel while I was gone?
05:26:48 <shapr> I wonder if there will be a report on the HIM conference
05:27:09 <shapr> oh, I persuaded Daan Leijen to put a license onto HaskellDB
05:27:21 <Lunar^> Hello shapr 
05:27:34 <shapr> and I've agreed to investigate writing a wxDatabase binding
05:27:35 <andersca> shapr: I heard you met nether
05:27:44 <shapr> nether is Lauri Alanko, right?
05:27:47 <andersca> yeah
05:28:06 <shapr> yah, he's cool
05:28:20 <shapr> I've seen him post to c.l.f and he's been here once or twice before
05:28:27 <shapr> bonjour Lunar^, comment ca va?
05:28:39 <shapr> oh, I need to send email about hOp to Jon Launchbury
05:29:12 <andersca> shapr: was john hughes there?
05:29:26 <shapr> yah, but I didn't get to talk to him.
05:29:33 <Lunar^> shapr: Bien :)
05:29:33 <shapr> I got to talk to Koen
05:29:36 <andersca> was koen there too?
05:29:37 <andersca> ah, cool
05:29:37 <andersca> :)
05:29:42 <andersca> what did he say?
05:29:55 <shapr> he said "what? drink beer *now*? I have a meeting!"
05:30:24 <andersca> haha
05:30:39 * andersca is taking courses by both koen and john this semester
05:31:00 <shapr> I spoke to a chalmers student whose name I can't remember at the moment :-(
05:31:15 <shapr> it bugs me to forget names
05:31:47 <Lunar^> shapr: Got my copy of SOE, which is really a nice book. I think I will just follow the first chapters for my course. :)
05:32:07 <Lunar^> shapr: A bit annoying that it was written prior to arrows though :(
05:32:49 <shapr> surprisingly, Jan-Willem Maessen doesn't like arrows.
05:33:11 <shapr> oh, he said he had some libraries to contribute to haskell-libs
05:35:13 <shapr> Lunar^: monads are simpler than arrows, it's probably better for teaching.
05:35:25 <shapr> I'd be happy if you prove that wrong though :-)
05:37:21 <Lunar^> shapr: I don't think so, the code of the reactive animation lib is awfull (IMHO)
05:37:56 <shapr> hey Esa
05:38:03 <shapr> you should have come to ICFP
05:38:05 <esap> Hi Shae!
05:38:30 <esap> Yea, I guess so, but couldn't.
05:38:43 <shapr> o3 wrote a binding to Obj-C that handles super/sub classing, using fundeps and mptc
05:38:52 <shapr> there was some heavy duty type theory that went waaaay over my head.
05:40:50 <shapr> phil wadler explained that call-by-name is the dual of call-by-value ... I think that's the correct two.
05:41:15 <shapr> and asked what's the dual of call-by-need
05:41:46 <esap> shapr: that's of course linear logic.
05:42:02 <shapr> send him an email ;-)
05:42:31 <esap> shapr: he didn't have the answer already?
05:42:37 <Lunar^> shapr: A binding for Obj-C means a port of Object-IO (of HGL) to Mac OS X !
05:43:01 <shapr> Lunar^: I doubt that, ObjectIO isn't portable to gtk
05:43:27 <shapr> anyways, o3 and wolfgang thaller seem like the head macos X guys for Haskell, you should ask them.
05:43:53 <shapr> the icfp contest results sucked much :-(
05:46:50 <Lunar^> shapr: I will... that would be cool to have a binding to Cocoa
05:47:13 <shapr> we saw demos of chameleon, proxima, and programmatica(?)
05:47:29 <shapr> and claus reinke's fp-refactor code hooked into gvim
05:47:54 <Lunar^> shapr: sebc is looking closely on proxima for his thesis
05:47:59 <Lunar^> shapr: btw, his coming to Paris soon :)
05:48:03 <shapr> cool!
05:48:14 <Lunar^> shapr: Maybe I will be able to make him work on hOp (for teaching sake ;))
05:48:15 <shapr> ooh, I told Martin Sulzmann about type error slicing
05:48:54 <shapr> martin's paper at ICFP/HW is closely related to that sort of stuff
05:49:09 <Lunar^> nice
05:49:14 <shapr> he turns typing rules into constraints and finds consistent subsets when there's an error
05:49:17 <Lunar^> They should make contact
05:49:22 <shapr> yes, I agree.
05:50:10 * esap is reading Wadler's paper.
05:50:27 <shapr> Phil Trindler talked about parallel and distributed Haskell implementations
05:50:40 <shapr> they got a grid computing version of Haskell working last week!
05:51:47 <Lunar^> "grid computing" ?
05:52:13 <shapr> means you can dynamically add/remove RTSs to a distributed execution
05:52:30 <shapr> like distributed.net or seti@home for Haskell
05:53:12 <shapr> right now, distributed implementations of nearly everything require that the same binary be executed on all machines, and the machines have to know about each other
05:53:34 <shapr> for example, PVM and MPI
05:56:10 <Lunar^> Niiiiice :)
05:58:57 <shapr> hi Bebabo 
05:59:12 <shapr> comment ca va?
05:59:15 <shapr> wie geht es?
05:59:20 <shapr> y0, wassup?
05:59:51 <Bebabo> huh?
05:59:55 <Bebabo> ça va bien
06:00:02 <Bebabo> geht recht gut..
06:00:08 <Bebabo> whatever ;)
06:00:10 * shapr laughs
06:00:23 <shapr> oh, that says en, not eb
06:02:10 * shapr was trying ebonics
06:02:19 <shapr> Bebabo: so, how's code?
06:02:25 <Bebabo> none...
06:02:31 <shapr> wow, that's rough
06:02:33 <Bebabo> lost myself here
06:03:09 <shapr> are you a programmer?
06:03:12 <Bebabo> just had a guy looking for haskell help on dalnet and since i was here on freenode and knew there was a good chance to find more people here than there i joined to check
06:03:15 <shapr> aha
06:03:18 <Bebabo> yes... but not haskell yet
06:03:25 <shapr> well, this is a great time to start!
06:03:52 <Bebabo> nearest i did until know is caml and lambda-calculous...
06:03:56 <Bebabo> s/know/now
06:04:07 <shapr> that's a good start
06:10:02 <shapr> have you seen the learning page on haskell.org?
06:10:26 <shapr> g'day RibRib 
06:10:34 <RibRib> hello
06:10:50 <shapr> how are ya?
06:10:55 <RibRib> i hav trouble writing a function 
06:10:57 <RibRib> can you help
06:11:14 <shapr> I can't help with homework, that would be unethical.
06:11:21 <shapr> but I can give you pointers to documentation
06:11:39 <RibRib> im given this
06:11:41 <RibRib> fw :: String -> String 
06:11:41 <RibRib> fw [] = []
06:11:41 <RibRib> fw (a:as)| a ==' ' =[]
06:11:41 <RibRib>          | otherwise = a:(fw as)
06:12:02 <RibRib> --gets first word of a string
06:12:32 <RibRib> i want to write one for the remaining words
06:12:46 <shapr> any ideas how that would work?
06:13:05 <RibRib> ill show u what fw does
06:13:13 <RibRib> > fw "one two three"
06:13:16 <shapr> I can see what it does
06:13:16 <RibRib> "one"
06:13:23 <shapr> I have written Haskell code before, I promise :-)
06:13:43 <RibRib> yeh i want to get the remaining words after applying fw to the string
06:13:47 <andersca> I updated my belt color 
06:13:50 <shapr> well, what do you think?
06:13:52 <shapr> andersca: spiffy
06:13:55 <shapr> oh, I should do that too
06:13:59 <andersca> :)
06:14:03 <RibRib> why would i be here if i know how
06:14:03 <andersca> yeah, you're better than me
06:14:06 <andersca> and I'm at the same level
06:14:12 <Bebabo> simply reapply fw to get the next word...
06:14:44 <RibRib> i want the whole string, not just the next word
06:14:53 <shapr> RibRib: that looks like homework, so I can't just give you the answer.
06:14:53 <RibRib> like this
06:16:17 <RibRib> ok
06:16:25 <RibRib> so what is this channel for?
06:16:29 <RibRib> idle?
06:16:34 <whee> haha, I managed to pull off using this WriterT monad with IO but I don't understand why it works 
06:16:53 <shapr> RibRib: ethical uses of Haskell.
06:16:55 <ibid> RibRib: discussion and help, but not for cheating in homework
06:17:14 <Lunar^> RibRib: I told you to look at takeWhile and dropWhile
06:17:45 <Bebabo> RibRib: the idea for a solution of ur prob is to use repeatedly fw to build up a list of the words...
06:17:47 <RibRib> this aint homework , its my way of solving an assignment question
06:18:07 <RibRib> so its my question...
06:18:21 <shapr> RibRib: you should try Lunar^'s suggestion.
06:18:34 <RibRib> cant use something i havent learnt
06:18:43 <Lunar^> @prelude dropWhile
06:18:45 <lambdabot> *** "dropWhile" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
06:18:45 <lambdabot> dropWhile
06:18:45 <lambdabot>   dropWhile ::  (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
06:18:45 <lambdabot>   dropWhile p []       = []
06:18:46 <lambdabot>   dropWhile p xs@(x:xs')
06:18:48 <lambdabot>   	 | p x       = dropWhile p xs'
06:18:51 <lambdabot>   	 | otherwise = xs
06:19:01 <Lunar^> Now you learnt
06:19:07 <shapr> oh, I bet I know where lambdabot's stack overflow comes from... hmm
06:19:44 <Lunar^> shapr: is @more working again ? (didn't took the time too look where it fails)
06:20:16 <RibRib> this is my assignemt if anyone's interested
06:20:18 <RibRib> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1011/assigns/ass1/index.html
06:20:23 <RibRib> lets discuss
06:20:23 <Lunar^> 15:17 <CowGirl> hey,....that was me u were talking to about takeWhile....
06:20:23 <Lunar^>                 dropWhile!! :)
06:20:23 <Lunar^> 15:18 <CowGirl> must be someone with the same assignment as me
06:20:24 <RibRib>  :)
06:20:26 <Lunar^> lol
06:20:37 <shapr> Lunar^: nah, it's broken
06:20:46 <Igloo> shapr: Oh?
06:20:52 <RibRib> can we discuss my assignment.. the logic, not the syntax
06:20:54 <shapr> yah, @more is broken
06:21:15 <shapr> I'll look at it after I've done my ICFP follow-up stuff, which probably means tomorrow.
06:22:28 <Lunar^> shapr: Are you going to blog something ?
06:22:51 <andersca> shapr: I'm pondering writing a d-bus implementation in haskell
06:22:53 <shapr> about ICFP? or what?
06:22:57 <shapr> andersca: yes! good idea!
06:22:59 <Cale> RibRib: also maybe look at "iterate"
06:23:05 <Lunar^> shapr: yes about ICFP
06:23:12 <Lunar^> andersca: What's d-bus ?
06:23:27 <shapr> Lunar^: I could do that...
06:25:01 <andersca> Lunar^: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/
06:25:04 <shapr> RibRib: happily, you still have a week to complete this assignment.
06:25:10 <shapr> that's more than enough time
06:25:37 <whee> ahh nuts; when I defined my own display function for the readline library, I broke cursor positioning
06:26:09 <Lunar^> andersca: is D-Bus meant to replace DCOP (in KDE) and CORBA (in GNOME) ?
06:26:10 <whee> wonder how I can fix that :\
06:26:17 <andersca> Lunar^: more or less, yeah
06:27:12 * shapr sighs
06:27:46 <Lunar^> andersca: What would be the intereset of doing an implementation in Haskell ?
06:27:56 <Lunar^> s/intereset/intrest/
06:28:05 <andersca> Lunar^: just because I'd like to do some haskell hacking :)
06:28:19 * andersca is pondering doing it as the project part of the afp course
06:28:36 <Lunar^> I understand... I should really write this Haskell (Evangelist|Enthusiast) License
06:28:53 <andersca> the HEL
06:29:29 <Lunar^> andersca: My question is, will it be really nicer than something like a C binding ?
06:29:32 <Cale> Heh, he should look at the FAQ for his assignment.
06:29:45 <Cale> 9. Is there a built in way to convert " two hundred thousand" into ["two","hundred","thousand"] ?
06:29:46 <Cale> Look up the inbuilt function 'words'.
06:29:46 <shapr> irchive_2: hey, are you trurl?
06:29:57 <shapr> Cale: reading directions is work.
06:30:02 <Lunar^> andersca: Something like a BSD with a clause about promoting Haskell
06:30:04 <Cale> heh
06:30:27 <shapr> hey, did I already mention that HaskellDB will soon have a BSD license?
06:30:38 <Lunar^> shapr: nice !
06:30:40 <andersca> or a DB-SD license
06:31:15 * Lunar^ is getting crazy of all these SoBig mails :(
06:31:42 <shapr> oh SPJ showed a way that polymorphic kinds could work in GHC
06:31:51 <andersca> was spj there?
06:31:53 <andersca> did you talk to him?
06:32:02 <shapr> it was a scary and nifty refinement of Odersky and Laufer's work
06:32:04 <Lunar^> shapr: I need to tell that to sebc !
06:32:19 <shapr> sure, I talked with SPJ lots more than I expected
06:32:44 <shapr> I met him the first night, he was at breakfast with us every day during ICFP/HW
06:32:58 <shapr> and I spoke to him more at HIM
06:33:15 <shapr> he's shockingly unscary
06:33:18 <andersca> I wanted to go to the ICFP too :(
06:33:32 <andersca> but instead I had to be home, drunk
06:33:40 <shapr> you should have showed up anyway
06:33:59 <shapr> I think Marvin-- introduced himself to SPJ too
06:34:07 <andersca> do you know a card game called fluxx?
06:34:10 <shapr> sure yah
06:34:13 <shapr> I even have tshirts for it.
06:34:21 <andersca> norpan wrote a fluxx game in haskell
06:34:25 <shapr> ooh where?
06:34:25 <andersca> http://norpan.org/fluxx/
06:34:29 <shapr> yay
06:34:51 <shapr> now we need a Set game
06:35:22 <Igloo> Is it a foldM init_rules [rules_changes] at the top level?
06:35:26 <shapr> that's great, is he going to publish it minus (c) material?
06:35:42 <Igloo> That would be a cute way of coding it and I think ought to work
06:35:47 <ibid> all material is (c) :)
06:35:57 <Igloo> PD material isn't
06:36:27 <Igloo> Nor are licence texts (although I don't know if they come under PD)
06:36:29 <ibid> and material is PD if all authors have been dead for at least 70 years
06:36:36 <ibid> licence texts are PD
06:36:37 <ibid> ähh
06:36:41 <ibid> sorry
06:36:44 <ibid> licence texts are (c)
06:36:46 <shapr> áhh
06:36:55 <shapr> àhh
06:37:03 <ibid> shapr: ?
06:37:09 <shapr> sorry, I was speaking with an accent.
06:37:14 <ibid> heh :)
06:37:24 <Cale> heh, Ã¥ah
06:37:36 <shapr> bah, utf-8 clients
06:37:46 <Cale> heh
06:38:15 <Igloo> You are allowed to copy licence texts
06:38:18 <andersca> i lÃ¶ve Ã¼tf-8
06:38:22 <Cale> UTF-8 is great for æ—¥æœ¬èªž
06:38:27 <ibid> Igloo: says who?
06:38:44 <ibid> Igloo: not at least our copyright laws 
06:40:53 <Igloo> I can't remember, but the idea is that the words have legal force so if you want to say the same thing you have to use the same wording
06:41:52 <shapr> hi apmuf 
06:42:07 <shapr> looking for Haskell programmers?
06:42:20 <apmuf> i think i found some here :)
06:42:25 <shapr> I suspect so.
06:43:06 <shapr> do you have a specific question? trying to learn the language?
06:43:11 <apmuf> don't need anyone right now, but i think i might need your help sometime soon
06:43:32 <shapr> I have these lovely lambda pom-poms
06:43:37 <apmuf> nah, we are "doing" that in school :))
06:43:45 <shapr> aha
06:44:08 <shapr> well, we can help you learn stuff
06:44:21 <shapr> but doing homework for others would be unethical
06:44:35 <shapr> and directly damaging to the education of those others also
06:45:03 <shapr> btw, which school do you go to? (if you don't mind me asking)
06:45:20 <apmuf> german school
06:45:29 <apmuf> www.hh.schule.de/kaifu :)
06:45:40 <apmuf> that page is crap...
06:45:42 <shapr> wow, I haven't heard of any german schools teaching Haskell
06:46:01 <CowGirl> shapr  .....  or should i call u Oprah!
06:46:11 <shapr> CowGirl: actually, I prefer Rikki
06:46:21 <apmuf> yeah, our teacher wants to learn it too, thats why he started to do it
06:46:24 <CowGirl> as least its not Jerry!
06:46:37 <CowGirl> or Geraldo
06:46:47 <shapr> I'm hoping to upgrade the chair on my talk show to family-beating quality, then maybe my ratings will approach Jerry's
06:47:29 <shapr> apmuf: that's a good reason
06:47:34 <shapr> I like Haskell.
06:47:57 <whee> and I hate terminals :(
06:48:51 <shapr> whee: without them you get infinite loops.
06:49:00 <whee> not those kind :P
06:49:04 <apmuf> mh, haskell seems to be quite nice .)
06:49:21 <shapr> I agree!
06:49:31 <shapr> I've written some Haskell code, and I plan on writing more.
06:50:40 <norpan> hi all
06:51:09 <shapr> hej norpan 
06:51:15 <norpan> hej hej
06:51:21 <norpan> spelar ni fluxx nu då :)
06:51:48 <shapr> jag har inte spelat just nu, men jag ska!
06:51:57 <norpan> someone has to write a nice gui client
06:52:07 <andersca> hej norpan
06:52:11 <norpan> hej anders
06:52:20 <andersca> so I'm thinking about d-bus
06:52:27 <shapr> is it thinking of you?
06:52:29 <andersca> oh wait, I'm not
06:52:31 * shapr hates one-way relationships
06:52:52 <andersca> I was just thinking if it's possible to have type classes without any functions
06:53:00 <norpan> andersca: yes
06:53:05 <andersca> oh, rock
06:53:09 <andersca> haskell is so cool
06:53:10 * shapr rolls
06:53:16 <norpan> but why would you want them?
06:53:37 <andersca> norpan: to limit the number of possible types for a higher-order function
06:53:42 <andersca> or a polymorphic function
06:54:16 <norpan> but why
06:55:17 <andersca> I wanted to limit the number of types you could pass to a marshal function in d-bus
06:55:47 <norpan> can you give an example?
06:56:04 <andersca> like, you can't marshal tuples for example
06:56:33 <Igloo> But you can marshal things without knowing their type?
06:56:38 <norpan> so marshal is an instance function
06:56:51 <norpan> but you jsut said you didn't want any instance functions
06:57:08 <shapr> wouldn't you just make some types an instance of Marshal or whatever?
07:00:52 <norpan> because you would obviously marshal different types differently
07:01:31 <andersca> norpan: yeah, I'm pondering doing it like that
07:07:30 <norpan> it's the obvious solution
07:09:00 <andersca> of course
07:09:03 <andersca> so how's prisoner norpan
07:11:26 <norpan> it's the worlds greatest tv show
07:12:07 <norpan> forkIO is nice
07:12:45 <shapr> what about forkOS?
07:13:03 <Heffalump> shapr: Ulf Norrell?
07:13:17 <shapr> Heffalump: was he the one sitting next to me?
07:14:04 <Heffalump> when?
07:14:38 <shapr> second time we had croatian beer
07:14:50 <Heffalump> the night you guys left?
07:14:55 <Heffalump> I think he might have been.
07:14:57 <shapr> yes
07:15:02 <shapr> hm, ok
07:15:04 <Heffalump> but I'm not entirely sure
07:15:29 <Heffalump> he, Daan and Bastian Heerens (as well as Jan-Willem and Clara) were the non-IRCers there that I can remember
07:16:13 <shapr> I wonder if Jan will visit here
07:16:44 <shapr> Bastian is really nice.
07:16:49 <Heffalump> I think Jan has more sense :-)
07:17:03 <shapr> hah
07:19:30 <shapr> andersca: have you tried to put ä into your nickname? can you have unicode nicks?
07:19:50 <andersca> shapr: no, you can't :(
07:19:55 <shapr> bah
07:20:05 <Cale> no kanji allowed either :(
07:20:05 <shapr> I want uirc
07:20:42 <shapr> hi Merlin99 
07:20:54 <shapr> looking for haskellers?
07:21:00 <Merlin99> hello
07:21:20 <Merlin99> yup, heard a little bit about haskell and was just browsing around.
07:21:29 <shapr> any questions?
07:21:38 <Merlin99> not right now, just hanging out
07:21:49 <shapr> would you like a link to the Learning Haskell page?
07:21:57 <Merlin99> sure
07:22:11 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
07:22:28 <Merlin99> hanks, I'll check that out
07:25:24 <shapr> well then
07:34:26 <shapr> hi Binkley!
07:34:29 <shapr> long time no see!
07:34:38 <shapr> it's been DAYS.
07:34:59 <Heffalump> hiya :-)
07:36:03 * shapr suspects Binkley is concentrating on wakefulness
07:36:14 <Binkley> oh, I was just reading the logs
07:36:19 <Heffalump> she should have been back for a day or so
07:36:24 <Binkley> seeing whether anyone said anything about me ;-)
07:36:34 <Heffalump> :-)
07:36:36 <shapr> Binkley: we've been limiting it to private msgs...
07:36:49 * shapr sets the ominous tone...
07:36:53 <Binkley> heh
07:37:36 <shapr> sooo, how's type based inferencing of list deforestation?
07:37:46 <Binkley> Haven't worked on it in 3 days.
07:38:21 <Heffalump> shock horror
07:38:32 <Heffalump> hmm. I seem to have lost a kernel.
07:38:40 <shapr> ?
07:38:47 <shapr> wouldn't that make it more difficult to boot your machine?
07:39:23 <Heffalump> well, dpkg thinks I don't have one installed.
07:39:24 <Heffalump> I'm fairly sure I do
07:39:25 <shapr> is there such a thing as multiarg combinators?
07:39:32 <shapr> or would that just be tuples?
07:40:07 <shapr> as in, arg1 combinator arg2 arg3
07:40:09 <Binkley> Depends in what language
07:40:15 <shapr> well, in Haskell
07:40:22 * shapr tries to say HASKell
07:40:28 <shapr> HASK'l
07:40:39 <Heffalump> so by combinator you mean infix operator
07:40:46 <shapr> er, yes, I guess so.
07:40:50 <Binkley> oh, I see
07:41:00 <Binkley> I don't think so, no
07:41:07 <Heffalump> well, you can do what he said
07:41:14 <Heffalump> just have (<+>) :: a -> b -> c -> d
07:41:23 <Heffalump> oh, no
07:41:24 <Igloo> It won't parse how you want it to though
07:41:28 <Heffalump> precedence would lose out
07:41:29 <Heffalump> yeah
07:42:05 <esap> x `combinator` y $ z $ q
07:42:09 <Igloo> But you could have a <> b = a b between arg2 and arg3, say
07:42:21 <Igloo> $ binds the wrong way
07:45:20 <esap> yea, might need some additional parenthesis with it
07:47:38 <Binkley> Hey, Smerdyakov
07:47:42 <Binkley> You're at Berkeley now, yes?
07:49:23 <Smerdyakov> Yes, and I've seen you several times. :)
07:49:30 <Heffalump> hehe
07:49:41 <Binkley> Hmm, odd
07:49:47 <Binkley> I've tried not to be seen as much as possible
07:50:00 * Heffalump doesn't think Binkley tries very hard at that.
07:50:02 <Smerdyakov> You seem to like bicycling a lot. ;)
07:50:18 <Binkley> How else are you supposed to get around Berkeley?
07:50:21 <Heffalump> though maybe you blend in a little better at Berkeley :-)
07:51:05 <Smerdyakov> Walking, since feet are less likely to be mutilated/stolen?
07:51:15 <Binkley> Nobody who isn't an idiot gets their bike stolen.
07:51:34 <Binkley> No, Virginia, you can't use a lock made out of dental floss and expect your bike will still be there when you return.
07:51:51 <Smerdyakov> Hehe... Evan Chang & Ana Ramirez had theirs stolen within 24 hours of arriving, they tell me.
07:52:06 <shapr> you should make a trojan bike
07:52:13 <Binkley> Yeah, but did they use Kryptonite locks and lock all the detachable parts, or not?
07:52:36 <Smerdyakov> I don't know. I'd imagine they were far too gracious in allowing for theft. :)
07:53:20 <Heffalump> Oxford is rumoured to have significant bike theft problems but mine has always survived
07:53:29 <Heffalump> I do usually use two D-locks though
07:53:35 <Smerdyakov> Binkley, did you get a message from postmaster at some university warning the CS graduate students list that it had an e-mail worm? :D
07:53:45 <Binkley> I had a bike stolen from inside a locked apartment building in Cambridge (MA), but I've had one for two years in Berkeley without anything happening
07:53:57 <Binkley> Yep, I got that... I wish they would close that lists to non-members
07:57:13 <Smerdyakov> Hm. There was an entrance exam for CS 262, and the web site lists by name who passed, etc., for the general public to see!
07:57:40 <Binkley> Whee, confidentiality
07:58:01 <Binkley> It's particularly embarassing in that case, since I passed that exam without ever having taken an undergrad OS class
07:58:11 <Binkley> So you have to wonder about the people who don't pass
07:58:30 <Smerdyakov> Undergraduate OS classes seem to be UNIX manuals split into several media.
07:58:35 <shapr> oh oh, I want to take the entrance exam!
07:58:40 <Binkley> Well, that's why I didn't bother taking one
07:58:46 <Binkley> shapr, enroll at Berkeley :-)
07:59:17 <Smerdyakov> shapr, doesn't seem to be posted online. :-(
07:59:28 <Binkley> Yeah, they probably use the same test from year to year
07:59:36 <Binkley> Did you have the question on idempotence?
07:59:40 <Smerdyakov> Yeah. LOL
07:59:54 <Binkley> Looks like it was the same, then
08:01:02 <Binkley> Heh, the reading list is pretty much the same as last year, too
08:01:11 <Smerdyakov> It seems you have a clever proof for a one-question test interpolation theorem! ;)
08:01:17 <Binkley> Oh, indeed
08:01:30 <Binkley> I don't remember any of the other questions, though
08:01:58 <Binkley> I only remember that one because I gave the wrong answer, not realizing it just meant the same thing it means in algebra
08:03:27 <Smerdyakov> I either remembered or guessed that it meant that, but I'm not sure if my answer was too flaky anyway.
08:03:50 <Binkley> Flakiness is the key to passing 262
08:04:24 <Binkley> Don't make the foolish assumption that you actually have to do *work* to pass it. That would be wasted effort.
08:05:08 <Smerdyakov> Well, unless I want to learn how to do better systems research. ;)
08:05:37 <Binkley> Eh, who needs that? PL is much cooler.
08:05:38 <Smerdyakov> I'm thinking systems will be my inside minor.
08:05:54 <Binkley> The problem with that is you'd have to take 252
08:06:58 <Smerdyakov> Really? There are explicit minor requirements for each area?
08:07:44 <Binkley> No, but there aren't that many different systems classes
08:08:06 <Smerdyakov> 262A, 262B fulfills the unit requirement,
08:08:29 <Smerdyakov> I want to take the security class also, and perhaps networking.
08:08:34 <Smerdyakov> So I don't see a problem there.
08:08:44 <Smerdyakov> (Not to mention 294's)
08:09:55 <Binkley> Yeah, I guess so
08:10:10 <Binkley> Just don't take 252. At least if it's with C*ll*r.
08:11:10 <Smerdyakov> I don't have the prerequisites, and primal forces prevent me from taking undergraduate CS classes.
08:12:07 <Binkley> That's a good thing. Yeah, I tried to take an undergrad CS class my first semester, and it wasn't worth the heartache
08:12:12 <Binkley> For one thing, I had to work with undergrads
08:13:10 <Smerdyakov> I would have to take 3 undergrad classes to have the prereq's formally for 252. :D
08:13:31 <Smerdyakov> (I've never taken an engineering class in my life before coming here where CS counts therein.)
08:17:15 <Binkley> Hmm, what would you have to take?
08:19:31 <Smerdyakov> CS 152, CS 150, EE 42
08:19:51 <Binkley> Ew
08:20:00 <Binkley> Yeah, avoid like the plague :-)
08:20:18 <Smerdyakov> I could probably learn 152 myself without the hassle, but I'd rather not.
08:20:46 <Binkley> You could get your Ph.D without ever taking a hardware class. And I would applaud you if you did.
08:21:03 <Smerdyakov> Yeah, I think a lot of CMU people do that. :)
08:21:29 <Binkley> Maybe I should be investigating this "CMU" place
11:32:13 * semaj is away: eat
12:11:48 * shapr yawns
12:14:18 <Lunar^> shapr: Who's Jon Launchbury >
12:14:40 <shapr> he's the CEO and President of galois connections
12:15:55 <Lunar^> Why would he be interested in hOp?
12:16:38 <shapr> some companies want OS verification, and it's a lot easier to verify a runtime system that's used as an OS
12:22:22 <Lunar^> ?? Don't see why
20:30:00 <Riastradh> I hate to ask an Erlang question here, but people seem to be avoiding #erlang because it's not big enough which in turn causes #erlang to be small; anyhow, what's Erlang's modulus device?
20:31:10 <Smerdyakov> I think you need to use the C FFI for that. It's system("rm -rf /usr/local/erlang")
20:31:43 * Riastradh slaps Smerdyakov around with a large process.
20:33:26 <Riastradh> And anyways, hah, there is no /usr/local/erlang on my box!
20:35:51 <Smerdyakov> Did it fall out the side?
22:26:30 <RibRib> hello
22:26:43 <RibRib> what does variable not in score mean?
22:26:46 <RibRib> scope
22:27:23 <ibid> that it is not in scope :)
22:27:37 <RibRib> in english?
22:27:45 <ibid> that was english :)
22:28:16 <ibid> variable scope is a rather basic concept in programming
22:28:42 <ibid> it is the area of program text where the variable can be used
22:29:37 <ibid> you are using the variable somewhere where it must not be used
22:32:40 <RibRib> nlp x 	|fw x=="negative" =(nlp (rw x))*-1
22:32:51 <RibRib> thats the line of the error
22:32:57 <RibRib> see any faults?
22:34:33 <ibid> is that all supposed to be on one line?
22:34:48 <ibid> which variable is it complaining about?
22:36:18 <RibRib> i fixed it
22:36:25 <RibRib> the -1 cant be at the back
23:39:55 <shapr> goood morning #haskell!
23:44:04 <shapr> wassup?
23:44:36 * shapr boings quietly
23:44:41 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym
