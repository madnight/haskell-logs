04:02:23 <shapr> so, anything exciting happening?
04:03:35 <Jerub> I'm trying to read a Greg Egan book, and my wife is almost exploding with stress over thesis deadlines.
04:04:34 <shapr> that's exciting

04:19:57 <lambdabot> 	In "King Henry VI, Part II," Shakespeare has Dick Butcher suggest to
04:19:57 <lambdabot> his fellow anti-establishment rabble-rousers, "The first thing we do, let's
04:19:57 <lambdabot> kill all the lawyers."  That action may be extreme but a similar sentiment
04:19:57 <lambdabot> was expressed by Thomas K. Connellan, president of The Management Group, Inc.
04:19:57 <lambdabot> Speaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,
04:19:58 <lambdabot> Connellan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess
04:20:00 <lambdabot> of attorneys and accountants, and a dearth of production experts.  Lawyers
04:20:02 <lambdabot> and accountants "do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure
04:20:04 <lambdabot> out how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value

04:26:54 <shapr> hi Arnia 
04:52:14 <shapr> if you were going to rename monads, what would you call them?
04:52:30 * shapr thinks up the "Haskell Luminaries Quiz"
04:52:35 <opet> I'd call them Dave
04:52:40 <shapr> oh, good name.
04:52:43 <shapr> This is Dave.
04:52:49 <shapr> This is Curried Dave.
04:52:53 <shapr> This is Dave with Onions.
04:52:58 * andersca bounces
04:53:00 * shapr boing
04:53:01 <shapr> s
05:06:49 <Verbed> ... nomads.
05:07:24 <Marvin--> heh
05:07:41 <Marvin--> "will you haskell people stop misspelling nomads, and what the hell do you use nomads for anyway?"
05:07:57 <shapr> has anyone tried the 2.6.0-test2 sources in Debian/unstable
05:07:59 <shapr> ?
05:08:18 <Verbed> I find that wonderfully poetic.
05:08:33 <Marvin--> shapr: no, I'm so chicken that I'll probably wait until 2.6.1, given Linus' idea of what a .0 release is meant to do
05:08:44 <shapr> me too
05:08:57 <Marvin--> "We need more people to test this, time to release .0"
05:09:37 <Marvin--> it's also quite scary that Linus says that the only arch that has to work for .0 to be released is x86
05:12:45 <Jerub> I can't wait for 2.6.1
05:12:48 <Jerub> :))
05:14:09 <Jerub> I remember running 2.4.0-test-x kernels
05:14:27 <Jerub> I remember fixing bugs in 2.4.0-test-x kernels and getting the patches accepted
05:14:33 <Jerub> that scarred me for life.
05:14:40 <Marvin--> heh
05:16:02 <shapr> I'm wary of running 2.6.*test* on my work machine
05:17:05 <Marvin--> I've been thinking about playing around with file systems, but I've come to the conclusion that it's probably better to do it in userspace, using gnome-vfs or something like that
05:17:21 <Marvin--> I still have to try the burn:/// vfs, it seems nifty
05:17:27 <shapr> I like ext3
05:17:34 <shapr> journaling is very nice
05:17:41 <Marvin--> well, I don't mean file systems for file storage, I meant file systems as an interface to other things
05:17:47 <Marvin--> i.e. virtual file systems
05:18:13 <shapr> oh
05:18:20 <shapr> like Plan9/Inferno/etc
05:22:16 <Marvin--> yeah
05:22:36 <Marvin--> but since it can be done in user space instead, with the nice frontend of Nautilus, why bother with the kernel? :)
05:23:29 <Marvin--> the burn:/// vfs is a vfs that lets you drag files there, and then write them to a CD, without intermediate storage (or so I gather)
05:23:38 <Marvin--> since the dragging doesn't copy files, just reference them
05:24:33 <andersca> yep, it's really nice
05:25:44 <Cale> somehow, implementing that stuff at such a high level seems inelegant to me, though. I think it would be nicer if it were actually part of the filesystem, mounted off of / .
05:26:19 <Cale> The hurd's translators would probably allow for things like that
05:27:49 <Marvin--> I really don't see the problem with user-space virtual file systems
05:28:44 <Cale> I don't either. I just think that they should become part of the same hierarchy as the rest of the filesystem.
05:29:03 <Cale> (they can still execute in user-space)
05:29:49 <Marvin--> that doesn't really matter, I find the hierarchy unimportant as such
05:29:59 <mattam> Cale: problem is lack of uniformity so ? like accessing samba:// from a terminal ?
05:30:04 <Cale> yeah
05:30:14 <andersca> I dunno, some things aren't meant to be unix file systems
05:30:22 <andersca> like, you can't get unix semantics on say http://
05:30:28 <Marvin--> andersca: Plan9ers would call you a heretic over that :-)
05:31:21 <mattam> well, i don't think linus would accept such a thing in the kernel, and it is the only place where it would allow uniform access
05:31:40 <Cale> mattam: have you seen the hurd's translators?
05:31:44 <mattam> yes
05:31:49 <mattam> very nice idea
05:33:47 <mattam> although in a `dead` OS. (maybe not for long)
05:34:24 <Cale> Yeah, I'm thinking that with a few small additions to the filesystem (subfiles, typing, couple other things) programs could expose their interfaces through the fs. GUI programs especially are not accessible enough from the commandline.
05:36:44 <Jerub> It'd be nice to just say "This is sourcecode" and be able to access /home/stephen/src/ /usr/src/ and /usr/local/src/ via that designation.
05:37:55 * Lunar^ dreams about dropping hiearchal filesystem
05:38:15 <Cale> With a good level of typing and metadata, you can get something that acts like an object model, but is easily supported by programs, as nearly all programming interfaces support filesystem access.
05:38:55 <mattam> Cale: That'd be interresting. Do anybody knows of a program/framework that allow clear separation of UI from Logic/Core giving chance to run a program in multiple modes : batch and command-line using scripting or direcly from shell like you say and some GUI's if you want ?
05:40:10 <Jerub> mattam: 'MVC'
05:40:25 <Cale> http://vx.hn.org/wiki.pl?FilesystemProgramInterface has some rough ideas of what I mean.
05:40:26 <Jerub> hehehe
05:40:26 <mattam> well, i was talking about code :)
05:40:29 <Jerub> that'd be cool.
05:40:41 <Jerub> foo.c::compile()
05:41:46 <mattam> Cale: no response from server
05:41:59 <Cale> oh, sorry... hmm...
05:42:24 <Cale> seems my internet connection dropped last night and I have a new ip
05:42:30 <Cale> 65.95.14.170
05:43:07 <mattam> k
05:43:34 <Cale> vx.hn.org should work later - I just updated it, but the incorrect data usually hangs around in the caches a while.
05:44:49 <Cale> I should probably expand that file with some more info about what I mean in places, and refine most of the ideas some more.
05:47:07 <Cale> In particular, I don't really talk about the effects on the GUI side of things very much (even though that's the first thing I mention).
05:50:35 <mattam> looks like a job reflexivity could ease, hence tunes could solve :)
05:53:36 <Cale> Are you referring to http://cliki.tunes.org/ perchance?
05:54:05 <mattam> yes
05:54:39 <Cale> hmm... I'm just looking at that now - it seems like an interesting wiki
05:54:49 <mattam> very well informed
05:55:52 <mattam> problem is, some things are still too high-level for me to work on it ;)
05:59:09 <Cale> :) I hope to refine the ideas there and put together something of a proposal. Since, to work effectively, it would have to require application-level support, standardizing the interfaces would probably help to keep things sane. The system level support needed to do such things is not so far away, I don't think.
05:59:58 <Cale> Perhaps ReiserFS 4 on the hurd would make a good start. 
06:00:11 <Cale> (though that doesn't quite exist yet)
06:01:35 <Cale> I'm going to go get coffee and breakfast. :)
06:01:38 <Jerub> I lost my OS to reiserfs, I'm on ext2 again :)
06:02:17 <mattam> really ?
06:02:26 <mattam> what happened ?
06:05:23 <Jerub> probing the IDE bus caused a crash (setting up new ide burner)
06:06:01 <Jerub> several important files were junked, including some in /var/lib/dpkg (I was doing apt-get's at the time)
06:06:36 <Jerub> I couldn't trust the integrity of the system, and it wasn't possible to install new packages without rebuilding the entire dpkg databases, so I reinstalled to be on the safe side.
06:07:21 <mattam> I got the same problem with ext3 :) and switched to gentoo with reiserfs...
06:07:31 <Jerub> heh
06:07:39 <Jerub> journaling filesystems are supposed to correct problems like that :)
06:08:23 <mattam> that's what the title says, but, as always, beware of 'apparences'
06:08:28 <mattam> ;!)
06:14:58 <Cale> I had some severe problems with my ext3 partition that only came up when doing a thorough fsck. Fortunately, all the files affected were unimportant, but there were an alarming number of errors.
06:15:36 <Cale> somewhere in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands.
06:16:23 <Cale> I have no idea what caused them, although I had just moved the disk to a new system, so that might have had something to do with it.
06:17:34 <Jerub> Actually, the dearth of information about versions and customisation and configuration of journaling filesystems scares me a little.
06:17:54 <Jerub> like, what if the format of the filesystem changes a bit and I upgrade this file -> do I break it?

18:41:04 <Pseudonym> That's it.  You're kicked!

20:29:20 * Pseudonym plays with google calculator
20:33:32 <Riastradh> Google calculator?
20:41:28 <stepcut> the google calculator rocks
20:42:00 <Pseudonym> Though I note it doesn't know metric cooking measures (e.g. metric cups), which is a glaring omission.
20:42:29 <stepcut> but it knows smoots
20:42:34 <Pseudonym> I can understand that it can't tell me how many cubic hogsheads are in a methuselah.
20:43:23 <Pseudonym> But now I know Planck's constant in btu-fortnights, so that's good.
20:43:56 <Riastradh> Er, where is this Google calculator?
20:44:02 <Pseudonym> Just type it in google.
20:44:11 <Riastradh> ?
20:44:12 <Pseudonym> Say: the answer to life the universe and everything in binary
20:44:20 <stepcut> Riastradh: http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator
20:44:30 <Pseudonym> Or: c in nautical miles per nanocentury
20:44:48 <Pseudonym> Oh, it doesn't do nanocenturies.
20:45:06 <Pseudonym> c in knots
20:45:25 <stepcut> http://www.pandia.com/sw-2003/31-google.html
20:45:36 <Darius> 101010
20:45:49 <Pseudonym> Darius: Yes, but you can ask google.
20:47:06 <Pseudonym> Woohoo.
20:47:15 <Pseudonym> 1 litre = 8.0081331 × 10^-24 acre Parsecs
20:47:20 <Pseudonym> Just what I wanted to know.
20:55:41 <Pseudonym> You could easily waste a lot of time here.
20:56:30 <Pseudonym> It's interesting to find out what units would actually make sense.
20:56:49 <Pseudonym> For example, a millibar is actually a sensible number of gigahertz troy ounces per fathom per fortnight.
22:08:50 <Jerub> well, pi seconds is a nanocentury.
22:08:51 <Jerub> :)
22:12:39 <Cale> It computes factorials using the gamma function :)
22:13:35 * Jerub laughs
22:24:57 <Pseudonym> So it does.
22:24:58 <Pseudonym> (0.5 factorial times two) squared
22:25:11 <Pseudonym> Cool.
22:36:08 * Darius smells a new lambdabot plugin...
22:36:18 <Pseudonym> Oooh, good idea.
22:36:29 <Darius> (actually a Google something plugin has been suggested many a time)
23:04:19 <Pseudonym> I'm kinda surprised that nobody has ported the higher-rank type inference engine to lambdabot yet.
23:10:58 <Darius> For @eval or for something like @type?
23:27:51 <Pseudonym> @type, I think
23:27:51 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "type,", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
23:27:59 <Pseudonym> @shut-up
23:27:59 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "shut-up", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
23:31:20 <Darius> hmm, I have hacked up a Hindley-Milner inferencer for LC+let and an intersection types inferencer for LC.  I added both of them to the dummy module for my lambdabot.
