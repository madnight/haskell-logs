04:45:46 <shapr> I think most students will have a math background, and Haskell is pretty easy to explain that way
04:45:48 <Jerub> shapr: no, I ahven't.
04:45:53 <shapr> "it works like an equation"
04:46:15 <shapr> many of my explanations start like that
04:46:15 <alanl> the problem is that quite a lot of people get turned off by excessive maths
04:46:16 <Jerub> I havne't written anything but demo programs to blow friends minds in under 5 lines since I did it at uni.
04:46:25 <shapr> Jerub: write a lambdabot plugin!
04:46:31 <shapr> alanl: lambdabot plugins! yay!
04:46:35 * shapr grins
04:46:38 <whee> haha
04:46:46 <shapr> it's actually pretty easy to make a lambdabot plugin
04:46:57 <shapr> of course, I wrote part of the plugin system, so I'm probably biased :-/
04:47:08 <Verbed> @yow
04:47:09 <lambdabot> O.K.!  Speak with a PHILADELPHIA ACCENT!!  Send out for CHINESE FOOD!!
04:47:09 <lambdabot>  Hop a JET!
04:47:14 <whee> shapr: I promise I'll write some lambdabot code once I get money for another computer :P
04:47:19 <shapr> whee: yay!
04:47:24 * shapr sends fifty cents to whee 
04:47:48 <shapr> actually, I found twenty markka today
04:47:54 <Jerub> shapr: hmm. I'll think about it ;)
04:48:17 <shapr> now that finland has switched to the Euro, markka aren't so useful anymore.
04:48:34 <whee> I keep reading that as 'marklar' :|
04:48:49 <shapr> yah, double consonants aren't so common in most languages
04:49:49 <Jerub> shapr: whats something 'serious' I coudl write in haskell.
04:49:53 <shapr> spiffy finnish tongue twisters http://www.uebersetzung.at/twister/fi.htm
04:50:05 <shapr> Jerub: lambdabot plugins, seriously
04:50:14 <shapr> I want to write a Haddock interface
04:50:17 <shapr> that would be extremely useful
04:50:21 <Jerub> I need something to get unrusty before I go off and implement a php parser in haskell ;)
04:50:33 <whee> I wrote something to churn out course schedules for me when I was learning
04:50:34 <shapr> oh, start out with simpler parsers then
04:50:42 <whee> learned parsec with that, and some other things
04:50:47 <shapr> parsec is extraspiffy
04:50:59 <shapr> Jerub: write a worklog program
04:51:04 <Jerub> yeah, I've got the parsec paper
04:51:16 <Jerub> I also read the paper its based on, monadic parser combinators.
04:51:19 <shapr> the calculator example could be adapted to count hours pretty simply
04:51:28 <shapr> then you just need something that saves a timestamp when you run it
04:51:58 <Jerub> calculator example ?
04:52:08 <shapr> calculator example in the parsec tutorial
04:52:09 <whee> how about you invent your own language and write an interpreter for it :)
04:52:35 <alanl> you mean like whitespace?
04:52:49 <Jerub> I'm seriously considering writing a s-exp based php-like.
04:52:56 <Jerub> (compiling to the parrot vm)
04:53:02 <shapr> alanl: you know about whitespace? :-)
04:53:17 <shapr> I think Martijn Faassen came up with whitespace
04:53:26 <Jerub> whitespace was on slashdot.
04:53:40 <shapr> wow
04:54:01 <Jerub> I don't think he's the first ;)
04:54:09 <whee> slashdot also has a "Pants Were Optional, 100,000 Years Ago" story running now.
04:54:19 <shapr> truly intellectual humor
04:55:13 <Jerub> shapr: hows cgi/haskell coming along. whats the best lib to be using?
04:56:41 <shapr> looks like WASH
04:56:49 <shapr> but I haven't tried the latest version
04:56:58 <shapr> built it, but haven't had time to play with it
04:57:58 <Jerub> is it stateful or stateless?
04:58:58 <Jerub> no, don't answer, I'll just read.
04:59:00 <shapr> heh, ok
04:59:17 <whee> heh
05:01:13 <Jerub> shapr: do you have a blog?
05:03:23 <shapr> yes, but it's not very exciting
05:03:42 <shapr> http://shae.livejournal.com/
05:03:53 <whee> I bet it's nothing but "BOING - 03/09/16"
05:03:54 <whee> :)
05:03:58 * shapr laughs
05:04:01 * shapr quickly posts that
05:04:10 <Jerub> oh good, I can put you on my friends page.
05:04:20 <Jerub> ;)
05:04:38 <shapr> whee: ok, there ya go :-)
05:04:46 <whee> :P
05:05:47 <Jerub> need bed.
05:05:57 <Jerub> g'night
05:06:44 <Jerub> shapr: I have an lj, but I find it hard to be technical there.
05:07:15 <Jerub> shapr: last time I posted sourcecode to my lj, people deleted me from their friends list for a couple weeks.
05:07:24 <whee> haha
05:07:31 <Heffalump> you didn't use a cut? :-)
05:12:18 <shapr> Jerub: I'm thinking of switching to wiwiwi
05:12:24 <shapr> since I have my own colocated box now
05:18:01 <shapr> hi Darius 
05:20:09 <shapr> y0 crazney 
05:42:18 <shapr> hej andersca 
05:42:21 <andersca> hej
05:42:28 <andersca> kerneln kraschar
05:42:46 <shapr> jag har hittat att ljupdate.el fungerar med svenska, men du måste gör C-x C-m f utf-8 i dit buffer.
05:42:52 <shapr> det suckar
06:04:06 <isomer> die sucker?
06:04:11 * isomer attempts to translate
06:04:30 <Cale> that sucks?
06:04:42 <isomer> what a sucker?
06:04:57 <shapr> "that sucks"
06:05:03 <Cale> yay!
06:05:25 <isomer> bah
06:09:24 <isomer> hey, shapr, do you use html-mode in emacs?
06:09:40 <shapr> I use the one derived from sgml-mode
06:10:16 <isomer> do you have electric carriage return working? ie auto tab when you hit return
06:10:30 * shapr checks
06:10:42 <shapr> y0 Riastradh 
06:10:59 <shapr> isomer: how do I turn it on?
06:11:10 <isomer> crap. i was about to ask you the same question
06:11:24 <shapr> I've used it before, but I'm used to using C-c C-t to toggle autohungry stuff in most modes
06:11:38 <isomer> also, does yours indent properly in the presence of unclosed tags like <p> and <img>?
06:11:48 <shapr> not in xemacs, only in gnumacs
06:11:56 <isomer> ah
06:12:22 <isomer> oh well.... i guess i'll either live with it or learn to fix it :)
06:12:29 <shapr> I tracked that down at some point, gnumacs changed the syntax table stuff dramatically at some point
06:13:14 <isomer> maybe i'll have a look at it in my copious free time
06:13:31 <shapr> my interest has switched to smarter structure editors
06:13:37 <shapr> like metaenvironment
06:13:48 <isomer> within emacs or entirely separate?
06:13:58 * isomer has become a bit of an ecb-mode addict
06:13:59 <shapr> either
06:14:02 * Darius wishes Proxima was readily available
06:14:18 <shapr> Darius: already read the fp-refactor presentation stuff?
06:14:46 <shapr> isomer: as much as I love emacs, structure editors will blow it away
06:15:17 <isomer> yeah
06:15:27 <Darius> Well I read something recently that referred to Proxima; I think that's what you're talking about, but I'd heard of Proxima earlier.
06:16:22 <isomer> hey, get this for a strange reversal of things, shapr: my dad moved to birmingham, and strangely, so might i be
06:17:54 <isomer> nearby?
06:17:59 <isomer> oops, wrong window
06:21:01 <shapr> isomer: cool!
06:21:11 <shapr> at some point I'll be moving back to birmingham, AL
06:21:24 <isomer> no kidding?
06:21:24 <shapr> probably in four years or so
06:21:54 <isomer> how come?
06:22:16 <shapr> because I want to live in the US more at some point.
06:22:23 <isomer> yeah
06:22:41 <isomer> that would be quite funny, huh? meet on the internet and then 6 years later end up in the same city :)
06:22:49 <shapr> yah, would be very cool :-)
06:22:52 <shapr> we could have hackathons
06:23:32 <isomer> that would be neat
06:23:42 <isomer> i'm still getting convinced we can do it now using vnc
06:24:45 <shapr> I'm willing to try it
06:24:48 <shapr> after ICFP :-)
06:24:54 <isomer> when is that?
06:25:40 <shapr> ~ three days from now
06:26:14 <isomer> cool - have fun there
06:26:19 * isomer will be rock climbing
06:27:16 <isomer> ooops....bbiab
06:30:11 <shapr> hi syntax-laptop-
06:55:41 <syntax-laptop-> hi all
06:55:48 <shapr> y0
06:55:48 <Heffalump> 'lo
06:55:50 <shapr> wassup?
06:56:10 <syntax-laptop-> not much; wanna hack/
06:56:11 <syntax-laptop-> ?
06:56:19 <shapr> sure, I can't fix this database anyways
07:00:21 <syntax-laptop-> now I finally see what the appeal of IRCing in Sweden is
07:00:24 <shapr> what?
07:09:35 <shapr> hi meep 
07:10:14 <Darius> yes, I too am curious to the appeal of IRCing in Sweden.
07:12:04 <Marvin--> shapr: hmm, had you used SQLObject?
07:12:49 <meep> hi shapr
07:17:43 <syntax-laptop-> IRCing in Sweden?
07:22:11 <Darius> <syntax-laptop-> now I finally see what the appeal of IRCing in Sweden is
07:22:42 <syntax-laptop-> oh. hm. um.
07:22:58 <syntax-laptop-> I guess i was joking :)
07:23:12 <shapr> see, it's not really fun to IRC from sweden, we just pretend it is
07:23:18 <Darius> This paper, uh, book is somewhat messed up.  They have (in ML) type Environment = ([String],[Value])
07:25:23 <Darius> and 1 is true, non-1 is false
07:26:11 <Riastradh> What's messed up about the Environment type?
07:26:44 <Darius> It would be more sensical and traditional to use [(String,Value)].
07:27:10 <Riastradh> I've seen ([String], [Value]) in lots of places.
07:27:14 <Riastradh> For example, EoPL and SICP.
07:28:07 <syntax-laptop-> Darius: I hear you use Windows
07:28:10 * Riastradh puts a strategic 'in' in his last sentence.
07:28:37 * Marvin-- pokes shapr
07:28:39 <syntax-laptop-> Darius: do Hugs and GHCI run natively in Windows?  (Is there a need for Cygwin when using Haskell?)
07:28:50 <Marvin--> shapr: I'm having problems with SQLObject...
07:28:54 <shapr> Marvin--: nah, haven't used it
07:29:00 <Marvin--> dang
07:29:07 <shapr> wanted to, but couldn't figure out how to get it working with Zope
07:29:10 <meep> syntax-laptop-: HUGS AND GHC RUN NATIVELY I THINK
07:29:16 <meep> oops, sorry for caps
07:29:20 <Marvin--> HELLO MEEP
07:29:24 <Marvin--> shapr: okay..
07:29:30 <Riastradh> HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR CAPS LOCK KEY?
07:29:41 <whee> IS THERE A PARTY IN HERE I JUST GOT BACK A/S/L?????????
07:29:55 <meep> lol, this is merciless
07:29:59 * shapr laughs
07:30:08 * Riastradh remapped his caps lock key to control.
07:30:19 <shapr> my caps_lock key is hippie-expand
07:30:20 <Riastradh> It still has the annoying light, but it's much more useful now.
07:30:24 <syntax-laptop-> meep: ah cool. so do people compile w/ ghc by using the command-line?
07:30:29 <Marvin--> Riastradh: me too, but without the light
07:30:32 <Riastradh> hippie-expand?
07:30:33 <shapr> ooh, you have a lit up caps_lock key?
07:30:53 <shapr> Riastradh: yah, it's the meta-dabbrev-expand thingy
07:31:04 <Riastradh> Er, yes...caps lock keys generally have lights in them, or the light is over to the top right of the keyboard.
07:31:32 <Marvin--> Riastradh: I just use xmodmap to do it, and I don't get any lights
07:31:59 <Marvin--> been a while since I wrote it, but I'm guessing that "remove Lock = Caps_Lock" is the significant part for that
07:32:44 <Darius> syntax-laptop-: Neither use Cygwin, I'm pretty sure.
07:34:28 <Darius> I use bash to do most commandline-y things.
07:36:19 <meep> syntax-laptop-: anyway, you don't need to install cygwin separately, even if they do use them (look, no caps!)
07:37:02 * Riastradh edits his ERC buffer so there are caps.
07:37:06 <Riastradh> Take that!
07:37:20 <meep> lol
07:38:05 <syntax-laptop-> thanks :)
07:40:21 <Marvin--> shapr: http://sjogren.ost.sgsnet.se:8080/test.py   <- that doesn't work and I don't understand why
08:33:25 <shapr> hi simon 
08:33:43 <simon> hi
08:34:15 <shapr> simon: are you one of The Haskell Simons ?
08:34:53 <simon> shapr: no, sorry. but who are they?
08:35:55 <simon> shapr ?
08:36:56 <Riastradh> Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Somethingorother.
08:37:53 <Marvin--> Marlow
08:38:27 <simon> wow, didn't know that my name is so big amongst programmers! ;-)
08:39:19 <syntax-laptop-> simon: yeah. a good way to get this channel to stop talking is to show up with the nick Simon :)
08:39:41 * shapr laughs
08:39:42 <syntax-laptop-> I for one dont' want to say anything dumb on #haskell in front of someone named Simon :)
08:40:01 <Cale> heh
08:40:31 <Marvin--> there's a Marlow on debian channels some times, first time I saw it, I went "wtf?"
08:40:51 <simon> don't worry guys. i'm sure all of you know more about programming than i do. :-)
08:41:00 <simon> just dropped in occasionally!
08:41:11 <simon> ..from the plone-channel
08:50:00 <shapr> hi flugger 
08:50:18 <syntax-laptop-> boy, I'm glad Simon left
08:50:19 <keverets> welcome back, simon-in-disguise
08:50:27 <flugger> hehe
08:50:34 <shapr> hi flugger, are you a haskell programmer?
08:50:37 <shapr> or do you want to learn?
08:50:54 * Riastradh whaps shapr.
08:50:59 * shapr is flat
08:51:16 <keverets> as an aside: at what point is someone considered "a haskell programmer"?  I have a feeling I'm going to be learning for a long, long time.
08:51:22 * Riastradh spherifies shapr.
08:51:47 * shapr is round
08:51:54 <shapr> keverets: I guess if you've been using it awhile
08:52:29 <flugger> to be honest, i not even know what haskell is about...
08:53:43 <flugger> i was just watching a hot discussion about programming languages at #plone. and this channel was mentioned there (as well as SIMON PEYTON JONES)
08:53:54 <keverets> flugger: haskell.org has lots of information.
08:54:03 <flugger> but it's really not me!!!
08:54:20 <flugger> i already checked quickly
08:54:46 <Darius> If SPJ doesn't hang out on #haskell, why would he be on #plone?
08:55:40 <keverets> perhaps he was just mentioned there.
08:56:02 <keverets> what is plone?
08:56:17 <Cale> appears to be a content management system
08:56:22 <simon> no i'm using plone and needed some professional hints, that's all!
08:56:38 <keverets> CMS using haskell?
08:56:39 <simon> ..and a friend told my about #plone
08:56:48 <keverets> nope... zope.
08:56:53 <simon> yup
08:56:56 <keverets> got my hopes up, there.
08:57:10 <Riastradh> Bah, the Pythoners are subversively invading #haskell!
08:57:35 <simon> is haskell very different from python?
08:57:39 <Riastradh> Yes.
08:57:40 <keverets> yes.
08:57:41 <Riastradh> It's much better.
08:57:44 <simon> hehe
08:57:47 <keverets> it's much different, anyway.
08:57:57 <Riastradh> Shut up, shut up.  It's just better, ok?
08:58:07 <keverets> oh, right.  I mean it's much better.
08:58:20 <shapr> I learned Haskell after learning Python
08:58:29 <shapr> I think there are many similarities
08:58:33 <keverets> Can you compile Python? or is it always interpreted?
08:58:39 <shapr> it's always interpreted
08:58:45 <shapr> even when compiled to bytecode
08:59:05 <Cale> I think that there's some work along those lines though...
08:59:13 <Riastradh> _Everything_ is always interpreted -- be it by software or hardware.
08:59:17 <simon> what, e.g. is programmed with haskell?
08:59:24 <shapr> lambdabot is written in Haskell.
08:59:27 <shapr> @listmodules
08:59:28 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]
08:59:29 <shapr> @yow
08:59:29 <lambdabot> My CODE of ETHICS is vacationing at famed SCHROON LAKE
08:59:29 <lambdabot>  in upstate New York!!
08:59:32 <keverets> Riastradh: sorry, should have been more precise, I guess.
08:59:50 <shapr> @fortune
08:59:50 <lambdabot> If you live to the age of a hundred you have it made because very few
08:59:50 <lambdabot> people die past the age of a hundred.
08:59:50 <lambdabot> 		-- George Burns
08:59:54 <shapr> @seen flogger
08:59:55 <lambdabot> I haven't seen flogger
09:00:00 <shapr> @seen flugger
09:00:00 <lambdabot> flugger has changed nick to simon.
09:00:00 <lambdabot> simon is in #haskell.
09:00:09 <simon> hehe
09:00:27 <Cale> there's http://psyco.sourceforge.net/
09:00:32 <shapr> that's true
09:00:37 <shapr> but it's altogether different
09:00:40 <Verbed> keverets: You may use the Psyco package to accelerate portions of Python programs.
09:00:42 <lambdabot> I'm watching you, simon!
09:00:58 * shapr makes a package for lambdabot to fit into
09:01:21 <simon> that's the first time in my life i got discriminated cos my name is SIMON :-)
09:01:22 <esap> Correctness is more important than performance.
09:01:26 <lambdabot> I know you're also in #plone...and you're sitting at a desk, with a half-drunk cup of coffee over to the side.
09:01:50 <shapr> whoa
09:01:54 <lambdabot> MWAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!
09:01:56 <shapr> that's a smart bot
09:02:03 <simon> lambdabot change your nick to bigbrother!
09:02:38 <lambdabot> That would be too obvious.
09:04:29 <o3> esap: btw, you were the guy who emailed me about java's overlaoded methods being able to return different types of values, right?
09:04:38 <lambdabot> Anyhow, Riastradh has some work to do, and he can't be handling my strings any more.
09:04:45 <Riastradh> HEY!  You weren't supposed to say that!
09:04:47 <Riastradh> @badbot
09:04:47 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "badbot", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
09:04:51 <Riastradh> Humph.
09:06:03 <o3> esap: i'm having trouble imagining where you'd do such a thing (have different types of return values for an overloaded function)
09:06:24 <o3> since you have to declare the type of each variable
09:07:02 <esap> o3: well in Java, it's not that useful. You do need (C++-like) templates to actually benefit from it.
09:07:05 <o3> only situation i can think of is if you're calling an overloaded function, and in the parameter of that function, you call yet another overloaded function.  that way you avoid assigning any explicit types
09:07:30 <o3> can C++ do that too?  (have overloaded functions with different return types)
09:07:36 <esap> o3: yes.
09:07:43 <o3> OK
09:07:48 <o3> looks like i didn't do my reserach properly, then :)
09:09:23 <esap> o3: In Java, that feature is just syntactic sugar basically, e.g. you can name set_X and get_X similarly without problems.
09:13:29 <esap> o3: In C++, you can do quite a bit of compile-time computations by relying on overloaded functions having different return types. See http://www.kotiposti.net/epulkkin/instructive/base-class-determination.html for a convoluted example.
09:15:42 <esap> Tricks like that were actually one reason I now prefer Haskell :-)
09:15:45 <o3> esap: awww, that is so dodgey :)
09:18:21 <Darius> @fact joy
09:18:21 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "fact", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
09:19:15 <shapr> any zsh users remember the 'not' syntax?
09:19:35 <shapr> I want to get a list of the files that aren't **/*.hs **/*.lhs
09:19:54 <whee> use the power of google :)
09:20:16 <shapr> :-P
09:20:42 <o3> shapr: **/*~**/*.hs
09:20:49 <o3> shapr: **/*~**/*.hs~/*.lhs
09:21:14 <o3> hmm, no
09:21:39 <o3> *puzzle*  i swear that should work
09:21:40 <shapr> is the tilde the usual not sign?
09:22:02 <o3> it should be in zshexpn(1)
09:22:18 <o3> ah

09:22:25 <hdaume> find . | grep -v '\.l?hs' is my solution :)
09:22:59 <whee> should be around there somewher :P
09:23:40 <shapr> o3: so what's the final thingy? I tried the ^
09:24:10 <o3> hang on.  dunn owhy my first solution doesn't work
09:25:09 <o3> oh
09:25:17 <o3> it's **/*~*.hs~*.lhs
09:25:23 <o3> (verified that works for me)
09:27:10 <andersca> hey dennisb
09:28:27 <dennisb> Hej. My computer locked up. Not a funny feeling...
10:09:26 <Darius> shapr: tell SyntaxPolice he can eta-reduce his quit message.
10:14:39 <mattam> eta-reduce <=> h-reduction ?
10:15:38 <Darius> assuming h is ascii-ification of eta then yes. \x.E x == E.  Especially as Haskell is cbn.
10:16:08 <Lunar^> cbn?
10:16:12 <mattam> cbn ? call by name ?
10:16:56 <Darius> yes call by name is what I meant though Haskell is more call-by-need in practice.  So, I decided on ambiguity.
10:18:02 <mattam> in Coq (theorem prover) they disctinct just lazy and cbv(alue)
10:19:21 <Darius> I'm assuming lazy = call-by-need (it's sometimes, though, rarely used for call-by-name).  I imagine that's because call-by-name would be painfully inefficient for whatever purpose.
10:19:44 <mattam> right
10:23:28 <Lunar^> Damn.. linking against mysql on Windows is such a pain
10:51:20 <shapr> hi jewel, ltns
10:51:35 <jewel> howdy
10:51:36 <shapr> hi jdahlin, have you been here before?
11:04:41 <dennisb> jdahlin: hi, what brings you to #haskell?
11:05:10 <dennisb> jdahlin is a python guy
11:33:48 <jdahlin> shapr: hello, no I haven't been here before
11:33:56 <jdahlin> dennisb: Hello
11:34:13 <jdahlin> dennisb: What brings me here is that I'll start study haskell in two weeks
11:43:08 <dennisb> jdahlin: at gu?
11:59:06 <shapr> yah, I've seen jdahlin on some other irc channels, but never #haskell
12:00:30 <shapr> jdahlin: so, you want the intro info?
12:01:18 <jdahlin> dennisb: yeah, cs at gu
12:01:31 <jdahlin> shapr: You've seen me on #python and #swedesex the weeks you were there
12:01:38 <jdahlin> Maybe in #emacs too
12:02:04 <jdahlin> shapr: I would love some good intro for my imperative mind
12:02:57 <shapr> jdahlin: http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
12:03:18 <shapr> that's a metaurl, it leads to other intros
12:03:32 <shapr> I should put swedesex back onto my autojoin list
12:03:47 <jdahlin> I've tried the gentle introduction to haskell, but I didn't find it very good
12:05:45 <shapr> I wrote up a superdense demo file recently, though I don't know how useful it is.... http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/src/haskell/Demo.hs
12:06:07 <shapr> it shows the basics of the language, though not the the spiffy standard funcitons
12:07:44 * Igloo bounces
12:08:07 <shapr> hi Igloo 
12:08:14 * keverets wonders why everyone seems boyant in #haskell
12:08:36 <keverets> perhaps boyant is the wrong term...
12:08:43 <keverets> bouncy, I guess.
12:08:46 <Darius> bouyant
12:08:56 <Igloo> Because we're all high on Haskell, baby!
12:09:08 <Darius> And there's always Helium.
12:09:27 <shapr> yah,that's why we all have squeaky voices
12:10:10 <keverets> very punny ;)
12:10:12 <shapr> oh, I'll get to meet Igloo for the first time soon
12:10:30 <shapr> and Heffalump
12:10:37 <shapr> and o3, and Marvin--, and...
12:10:49 <shapr> and kosmikus
12:12:22 <keverets> shapr: you might want to add "alsoAdd1 = (+) 1" or similar to your demo, to show that style
12:12:22 <shapr> oh, I'm showing up in Uppsala a day earlier than I thought
12:12:33 <Igloo> Yes, and we get to see you demonstrate contact juggling no a unicycle
12:13:00 <shapr> sadly, I was told to not ride my unicycle for at least a week :-(
12:13:05 <Lunar^> internal error: resumeThread: thread not found <-- uhh
12:13:16 <shapr> the nurse said "try something with two wheels"
12:13:28 <Igloo> Oh  :-(
12:13:39 <shapr> the doctor just looked at me funny when I told him I was riding my unicycle
12:13:46 <Igloo> Heh
12:13:55 <shapr> Igloo: did I tell you I got five stitches in my knee yesterday?
12:14:05 <shapr> no, day before yesterday.
12:14:08 <Igloo> I saw it on here  :-/
12:14:30 <shapr> I'll bring my juggling balls, but no unicycle :-(
12:14:47 <Igloo> Oh well, something to look forward to for next time  :-)
12:14:50 <shapr> heh, yes!
12:15:04 <Igloo> That must be when you come to the UK  :-)
12:15:13 <shapr> right!
12:15:23 <shapr> oh, we're going to france for Xmas!! I've never been to france!
12:15:27 * shapr bounces excitedly
12:15:35 <Igloo> That'd suit wol - she wants to meet you
12:15:40 <Igloo> Cool
12:15:48 <shapr> I'm much less scary in person, probably :-)
12:16:11 <shapr> I want to meet wol too.
12:16:19 <Igloo> You don't seem scary on IRC. And I've only got evidence of you inflicting physical damage on yourself.
12:16:26 <shapr> hah
12:16:29 * shapr snickers
12:17:30 <shapr> keverets: I think a PreludeDemo.hs would be a good companion.
12:17:41 * shapr watches jdahlin bounce
12:17:48 <shapr> hej jdahlin, vad händer?
12:17:52 <jdahlin> shapr: Yeah, silly utf-8 problems
12:18:05 <keverets> shapr: definitely.
12:18:22 <Lunar^> shapr: neat :)
12:18:30 <jdahlin> shapr: Ã„r inte det hÃ¤r en engelsk kanal?
12:18:42 <shapr> det är, men svenska är så kul.
12:19:33 <shapr> man har fragat(?) "ska du ha en svensk #haskell också?"
12:19:51 <jdahlin> #haskell.se
12:20:09 * shapr snickers
12:44:05 <Lunar^> internal error: resumeThread: thread not found WHY !? :((
12:45:08 <Igloo> What are you doing?
12:45:26 <Lunar^> Too many things actuallly
12:45:34 <Lunar^> Seems to be MySQL related anyway
12:45:42 <Igloo> Presumably it tells you to mail g-h-b though, which is good advice, preferably with a small test case
12:45:51 <Igloo> Ah, OK
12:45:56 <Lunar^> Yep.. trying to trim it down
12:46:13 <Lunar^> FFI could make this happen, right ?
12:46:44 <Igloo> I imagine this should never happen
12:47:37 <Lunar^> after 1 hour struggle to make it link on Windows
12:47:43 <Lunar^> Going to test on Linux now
12:53:54 <Lunar^> it's working on Linux
12:54:05 <Lunar^> seems to be somehow related to MySQL, linking, dll, ...
12:54:09 <shapr> hey jewel, how'd you get back to .za?
13:13:19 <Lunar^> bug report sent
13:22:47 <hdaume> where is .za?
13:36:07 <jewel> south africa
13:40:30 <hdaume> ah
13:41:01 <jewel> I'm trying to find a job in spain
13:41:07 <jewel> but don't really know how to go about it
16:33:48 <Tomasso> can anyone tell me how to define the operation and' without using the defined functions in hugs??
16:34:12 <Tomasso> (whats the diference between operation and function?) in functional programming
16:34:47 <Smerdyakov> The word "operation" has no standard meaning in functional programming.
16:35:28 <Tomasso> hmhm thank you
16:35:58 <Smerdyakov> If you are asking about how to define short-circuit boolean functions, try using if..then..else.
16:36:41 <Tomasso> Smerdyakov: and how do i take the two boolean expressions, as parameters?
16:37:11 <Smerdyakov> The same way you take any others. I think the lazyness of Haskell helps you here.
16:37:20 <hdaume> Tomasso: are you talking about foldr (&&) True ?
16:37:39 <Tomasso> && is and in hugs
16:38:02 <hdaume> afaik, and :: [Bool] -> Bool, wheras (&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
16:38:13 <hdaume> you want to redefine && then?

23:51:13 <shapr> nah, I have work to do
23:51:26 <shapr> learning more about zope/plone
23:51:53 <Verbed> Ah, I just constructed a simple site using Zope.
23:51:57 <shapr> what do you think?
23:52:06 <Verbed> The Sessioning mechanism is very useful.
23:52:32 <shapr> Zope has many useful mechanisms in my experience.
23:52:38 <shapr> I do wish it were easier to unit test.
23:53:03 <Verbed> It does well at abstracting away the stateless nature of HTTP.
23:53:27 <Verbed> A protocol designed for large amounts of structured, static data.
23:54:39 <shapr> I'd prefer something like Zope written in Haskell.
23:54:50 <shapr> I should try the latest version of WASH
23:54:58 <Verbed> http://strangeloop.dnsalias.net:8080/Poetry/
23:55:26 <Verbed> It just contains a few of my pieces and my favourites of others.
23:56:35 <shapr> I like Scratch
23:59:34 <Verbed> The framework I've written is very simple, but it allows me to add poets/poems as folders/plaintext.
