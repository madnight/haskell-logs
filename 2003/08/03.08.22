00:03:46 <Pseudonym> Strong opinions about checked exceptions on LtU.
00:04:15 <Heffalump> LtU?
00:04:21 <Pseudonym> Lambda the Ultimate
00:09:28 <Pseudonym> Gotta go.  Have a good weekend, all.
01:12:42 * Marvin-- looks around for David Roundy
01:29:15 <Heffalump> does he IRC?
01:29:44 <Marvin--> don't know
01:29:47 <Marvin--> I sent him a mail anyway
01:54:34 <sjj> shapr: hahahaha
01:56:47 <sjj> shapr: meanie ;)
02:18:09 <ibid> which papers would you consider the most important in the field of functional programming?
02:40:34 <Darius> You'd have to be more specific than that.
04:02:59 <ibid> Darius: specific in what way?
04:27:33 <Darius> important how and to whom? what do you consider "functional programming"? and just more specific in general: theoretical? practical? what domain? etc.  It isn't too likely that there are important -papers- of FP in general.
04:27:50 <Darius> s/of/on/
04:28:13 <Heffalump> personally I think Wadler's paper on monads is the most important
04:28:29 <Heffalump> but obviously as Darius says context matters :-)
04:28:52 <Darius> Heffalump:  Which one?
04:29:25 <Heffalump> the one saying we should use monads in FP, I forget the title
04:29:28 <Verbed> http://strangeloop.dnsalias.net:8080/Poetry/Creeley/Water2
04:29:53 <Heffalump> "How to declare an imperative" possibly
04:30:07 <Darius> That's what I'm thinking
04:30:24 * Darius consults his horribly organized 185+ mb of CS papers
04:31:07 <Heffalump> possibly "The essence of functional programming"
04:31:28 <Heffalump> I guess partly it depends if you want historical importance or the most useful to read now
04:31:42 <Heffalump> historically, I'd point to whichever was the first of his papers to suggest using monads in FP.
04:36:25 <Igloo> Surely the first on LC is more important historically
04:36:28 <ibid> my list includes currently 'can programming be liberated from the von neumann style ...', 'why functional programming matters' and 'how to declare an imperative'
04:36:47 <ibid> but i was wondering if it is a good list :)
04:37:41 <ibid> i'm collecting a list of papers to suggest to the students at my FP course in case they are interested, and depending on the papers, perhaps even as required reading
04:38:07 <Darius> Heffalump: Yeah, "The Essence of Functional Programming", which I have downloaded, but appears to be missing.
04:39:05 <Darius> hmm, "which I have downloaded" is an ambiguous phrase.
04:42:48 <ibid> do you think that's a likely list? are they superfluous? am i missing some important paper?
04:42:51 <Darius> Awkward Squad might be a nice one to go along 
04:43:59 <Darius> Purely Functional Data Structures by Okasaki is probably another good choice.
04:44:20 <ibid> i have it on the list of books :)
04:44:28 <ibid> but the paper may be useful too
04:45:54 <Darius> Design of a Pretty Printer library or Deriving a Backtracking monad (or whatever it's called) may be good choices, and that reminds me of Calculating Functional Programs.
04:46:47 <Darius> Theorems for Free! may also be a good idea.
04:47:09 <ibid> i'm not sure i want to include much monad stuff, most of it is beyond what i think i can achieve in the course
04:47:16 <ibid> i looked at Theorems for Free
04:53:19 <Darius> or you could get around all this and just send them to the "Evolution of a Haskell Programmer" page
05:07:24 <Heffalump> "Calculating Functional Programs"?
05:12:41 <Darius> http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/publications/index.html#calcfp
05:15:06 <Heffalump> ok, you did mean that one

07:28:20 <Marvin--> awright, droundy is as keen as I am on putting darcs in Debian
07:29:50 <Igloo> Excellent
07:30:18 <Marvin--> damn you, I just watched Simpsons, now I'm going to call you mr Burns when I see you next :)
07:33:07 <Igloo> :-)
07:35:39 <Heffalump> am I confused, or does Haskell do precisely what Cagdas Ozgenc (on the mailing list) wants?
07:36:03 <Marvin--> damn it, evolution crashed again
07:36:05 * Marvin-- blames it on libc
07:37:21 <Marvin--> which mailing list?
07:38:13 <Marvin--> I'm not on haskell-cafe
07:39:23 <Heffalump> ah, yes, -cafe
07:40:40 <Marvin--> my god these Japanese are insane

08:00:45 <shapr> @yow
08:00:45 <lambdabot> NATHAN...  your PARENTS were in a CARCRASH!!
08:00:45 <lambdabot>  They're VOIDED - They COLLAPSED
08:00:45 <lambdabot>  They had no CHAINSAWS...  They had no MONEY MACHINES...
08:00:45 <lambdabot>  They did PILLS in SKIMPY GRASS SKIRTS...
08:00:46 <lambdabot>  Nathan, I EMULATED them...  but they were OFF-KEY...
08:02:46 * shapr prepares to travel to Uppsala
08:03:08 <shapr> anyone know of a PDF or PS viewer for PalmOS?
08:03:23 <shapr> hey Explodey, coming to ICFP?
08:04:03 <shapr> hi Dark-Star 
08:04:32 <Dark-Star> hi
08:04:52 <Explodey> shapr: no
08:05:15 <shapr> Explodey: aww
08:40:34 <Heffalump> are the electric sockets in Sweden like those in the rest of continental Europe?
08:40:43 <Heffalump> and it's 220V I presume?
08:41:08 <Igloo> shapr's going/gone already?
08:41:19 <Heffalump> true.
08:42:04 <Igloo> That wasn't related to your question, just me expressing surprise
08:42:30 <Heffalump> ah.
08:47:48 <Marvin--> Heffalump: 230
08:49:20 <Marvin--> this site is probably out of date: http://www.dbicorporation.com/internat/intpower.htm but it's roughly correct :)
08:49:23 * Igloo realises I need 2 adaptors if I want to be able to carry one around and leave an alarm clock plugged in
08:49:45 <Marvin--> for example, it lists Sweden with 220V sockets, and that changed quite a few years ago
08:49:54 <Marvin--> but the socket types are correct
08:50:09 <Heffalump> I think I meant 230
08:50:17 <Marvin--> yeah, sure, whatever ;)
08:50:18 <Heffalump> that's what Europe standardised on.
08:50:23 <Marvin--> eah
08:50:25 <Marvin--> +y
08:50:29 <Heffalump> cos we went down from 240 and others went up from 220
08:50:45 <Marvin--> but that's just an average value anyway
08:51:43 * Igloo appears to have something with round pins further apart than an American one and with what I assume is an earth bit at the bottom that doesn't stick out
08:52:23 <Heffalump> DYM a root-mean-square value.
08:52:28 <Heffalump> s/\./?/
08:52:55 <Marvin--> what I mean is, 230V is the target value, but surely it fluctuates?
08:54:47 <Heffalump> ah, right
08:55:00 <Heffalump> I think the grid managers here do quite well in keeping it fairly tight, though I could be wrong
09:02:07 <Igloo> Are things like "Sysslomansg. 15" on http://www.it.uu.se/pli03/restaurants.shtml addresses?
09:06:59 <Smerdyakov> They're particular poisons and their commonness in food at those restaurants.
09:11:49 <Heffalump> :-)
09:11:53 <Heffalump> they almost certainly are, yes
09:14:10 <Igloo> I started off thinking they were ratings as they went 15, 15, 14, 13
09:16:48 <Marvin--> Igloo: heh, addresses yes, street name and street number
09:17:11 <Marvin--> "g." is short for "gatan" (street)
09:17:18 * Igloo wonders if I can be bothered to try finding a colour printer that has some non-blue ink in
12:09:44 <shapr> Igloo: haven't left yet
12:09:47 <shapr> Igloo: in an hour
12:11:07 <Igloo> Still 1.5 days before us  :-)
12:13:17 <Marvin--> you leaving already?
12:13:43 <shapr> yah
12:14:26 <Marvin--> a few recreational days in U-sala before the conference?
12:15:33 <dennisb> He is going by bike to save some money
12:15:59 <dennisb> (at least it's my guess)
12:15:59 <Marvin--> ahh, smart
12:16:04 <Marvin--> why didn't I think of that :(
12:16:42 <Igloo> I don't think it will save money if it means spending an extra night at a hotel
12:16:43 <Heffalump> I hope he's not unicycling :-)
12:16:57 <Heffalump> but he'll be spending it on the bike, surely
12:17:05 <Marvin--> Igloo: there are tents!
12:17:11 <dennisb> Igloo: so my theory might have a hole in it
12:30:15 <shapr> yah, SyntaxPolice and I are going to start hacking early
12:30:49 * shapr disappears for nine days or so...
12:31:18 <Marvin--> shapr: see you on Wednesday
12:35:51 <scharob> Hi dudes
18:33:10 <flippo> @yow
18:33:10 <lambdabot> YOU PICKED KARL MALDEN'S NOSE!!
