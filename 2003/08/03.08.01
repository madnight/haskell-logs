06:30:15 <shapr> hey anth
06:31:51 <isomer> morning shae
06:31:56 <shapr> what's up?
06:31:56 <isomer> er...afternoon
06:32:07 <isomer> big day of studying today. you?
06:32:42 <shapr> lots of work
06:32:51 <isomer> ick
06:32:58 <shapr> I'm moving my ScannedInAvian domains to my colocated box
06:33:04 <shapr> it's more fun to work if you're self-employed
06:33:16 <isomer> are you still? that's great!
06:33:25 * isomer loves not having a boss
06:33:35 <shapr> yah, it's great
06:33:39 <isomer> i'm back at school, and don't have one either
06:33:50 <shapr> what are you studying?
06:34:34 <isomer> biochemistry...i'm writing the med school entrace exams in a couple of weeks.
06:34:59 <shapr> cool!
06:35:09 <isomer> thanks
06:35:13 <isomer> i'm really enjoying it
06:35:29 <isomer> being back at school is a bit weird, though...but whatever
06:35:40 <shapr> I'd like to do that myself
06:36:03 <isomer> oh yeah? what are you interested in studying?
06:36:22 <shapr> computers, math, art
06:37:18 <isomer> oh yes. did computers and math already and loved it. i'm sure you would love it too.
06:37:41 <isomer> (brb)
06:39:51 <isomer> so what got you into haskell in the first place, shapr?
06:40:20 <MakeMyDay> HI!
06:40:59 <isomer> morning
06:41:32 <MakeMyDay> Ok I got a critical question. I am looking for a good tutorial , I have to learn the basics of Haskell in 3 days, so please excuse the stupid question
06:42:20 <Smerdyakov> Why do you have to learn the basics of Haskell in 3 days?
06:42:30 <MakeMyDay> Because I have a exam in 3 days
06:42:36 <MakeMyDay> and it is like 15% haskell
06:42:39 <vegai> auch
06:42:51 <MakeMyDay> don't imagine any insane stuff just a basic understanding would do
06:42:52 <steveh> heheh
06:43:11 <MakeMyDay> I know...i know
06:43:16 <sjj> generally exams are given after they cover the material ;)
06:43:32 <MakeMyDay> well yeah but our prof is an idiot
06:43:38 <MakeMyDay> He is this Haskell lunatic
06:43:44 <steveh> lol
06:43:58 <steveh> you'll not be getting enthusiastic help with that attitude
06:44:01 <MakeMyDay> heh
06:44:05 <MakeMyDay> I don't mean it that way
06:44:06 <Smerdyakov> Nonetheless, if you think that you are being tested unfairly, he is the person to ask.
06:44:20 <Smerdyakov> And if he's not a help, then you should complain to some higher-up person.
06:44:22 <vegai> MakeMyDay: better not study it, you might become a Haskell lunatic yourself!
06:44:25 <Smerdyakov> At your school, not here
06:44:33 <sjj> our haskell lecturer didn't really speek proficient english, but I still managed to enjoy the class
06:44:35 <MakeMyDay> Uni 
06:44:48 <MakeMyDay> Well this isn't a haskell class
06:44:49 <sjj> er, speak.
06:45:15 <MakeMyDay> it is Computer Science 2. Which is Technical Computer Science
06:45:25 <MakeMyDay> But he decided to add Haskell like in the last week
06:45:44 <MakeMyDay> When we did Java all year long
06:46:07 <vegai> I would respect that prof
06:46:09 <MakeMyDay> and excuse me but his way of teaching Haskell SUCKS
06:46:18 <vegai> ok, that is a different thing
06:46:26 <MakeMyDay> Hey I like Haskell 
06:46:47 <MakeMyDay> I programmed a program in 3 lines of haskell which took 50 in Java
06:47:06 <steveh> heh
06:47:11 <steveh> imagine doing it in  C
06:47:14 <MakeMyDay> :o
06:47:24 * vegai guesses ~25 lines in C
06:47:53 <ibid> or 200
06:47:56 <vegai> but only because there are more C-programmers with 20 years programming experience than Java-ones =)
06:47:58 <steveh> heheh
06:48:02 <ibid> depending what it is that was done...
06:48:06 <steveh> depends on if you use the Java library
06:48:30 <MakeMyDay> yeah well it was a gray-code thingie
06:48:45 <MakeMyDay> give all the graycode for n
06:48:50 * steveh has seen advertisements for people with "10 years J2EE experience"
06:49:06 <ibid> uhh...
06:49:12 <steveh> ibid: exactly. :)
06:49:16 <ibid> :-)
06:50:00 <isomer> you see ads for people with 5 years of .net now ;)
06:50:11 <Igloo> The best ones are adds for people with x years of Win y experience in a year <x+y
06:50:21 <MakeMyDay> heh
06:51:12 <MakeMyDay> So do you know a good newbie Haskell tutorial
06:51:36 <Darius> Besides Java *shudder* what other languages are you familiar with?
06:51:42 <MakeMyDay> Basic :d
06:51:46 <MakeMyDay> Pascal:d
06:51:52 <MakeMyDay> no functional languages
06:52:00 <MakeMyDay> which seems to be a problem 
06:52:18 <MakeMyDay> is it worth buying a book ?
06:52:26 <vegai> generally, yes
06:52:35 <shapr> isomer: sorry, I was distracted by a phone call
06:52:37 <steveh> http://www.cs.lth.se/Education/Courses/EDA120/TwoDozenLessons/twoDznQ.pdf
06:52:44 <steveh> do that
06:52:47 <steveh> it works pretty well
06:52:59 <steveh> and as long as your prof is sane he won't ask anything not covered by it
06:53:06 <MakeMyDay> thx
06:53:35 <MakeMyDay> We'll see about the sane part though :p
06:53:40 <MakeMyDay> better get started then 
06:53:50 <Darius> "Whaddaya mean you can't implement a continuation monad transformer over state?"
06:53:59 <vegai> 3 days should be more than enough if you manage to focus
06:54:05 <steveh> :)
06:54:17 <shapr> I have Functional CoDependencies.
06:54:20 <vegai> "Explain monads"
06:54:25 <MMD|Reading> ow and just as a side note , we had exersices in Haskell but there was only 1 out of 50 tutors that knew Haskell
06:54:25 <steveh> http://www.cs.lth.se/Education/Courses/EDA120/TwoDozenLessons/twoDznA.pdf is the answer key but don't skip ahead to it unless you're really stuck
06:54:26 * shapr snickers
06:54:57 <steveh> complete the little programs the author gave you without peeking, and you should be good on the exam
06:55:07 <shapr> isomer: I got into Haskell when Guido van Rossum decided against putting stackless python into the core
06:55:19 <isomer> oh, i see
06:55:25 <shapr> I wanted to play with first class continuations because they were sexy and powerful
06:56:00 <shapr> I realized that a function call was not a basic building block of programming, so I went to find a language where I could work with the pieces.
06:56:25 <steveh> the other option is the book by Paul Hudak if you can find it.
06:56:50 <isomer> shapr: and? worth the investment in learning?
06:56:59 <shapr> isomer: I have not been disappointed by Haskell. I've found lots of things I've never heard of before, which makes me happy.
06:57:41 <shapr> imho, the only downside of Haskell is the lack of libraries, but I'm slowly working on that, and so are many other people.
06:59:30 <shapr> other people may have other views on Haskell though
06:59:39 <shapr> anyone here want to talk about Haskell warts?
06:59:53 <shapr> Darius: what would you consider Haskell warts?
07:00:41 <steveh> compiler error messages sometimes leave something to be desired
07:00:41 <MMD|Reading> hahaha , I only read 2 pages of that tutorial and allready I know more about haskell then a week with my prof :d thx a million 
07:00:52 <steveh> MMD: glad to be of help :)
07:00:58 <shapr> oh, I'd like subtypeclasses where parent class default methods are automatically included
07:03:15 <isomer> Fatal server error:
07:03:15 <isomer> Caught signal 11.  Server aborting
07:03:31 <isomer> doh - wrong window...sorry :~
07:04:21 <vegai> shapr: monads is a sort of wart
07:04:43 <vegai> which turns into a princess when kissed, obviously
07:07:28 <Darius> shapr: sorry, reaoding other stuff
07:08:08 <Darius> steveh: Supposedly, Hugs has absolutely horrible error messages.  One particular one someone posted, -was- horrible.
07:14:17 <shapr> I wonder if Helium errors are really that much better
07:14:33 <isomer> *sneeze*
07:15:31 <Darius> I downloaded that one time.  While much less cryptic, I don't think the message was right.  Unfortunately, I can't do some really horrible type things with it.
07:16:57 <Darius> Right, insofar as the advice it gave was not the correct thing that needed fixing, merely something that could be changed to make it workout... maybe.
07:20:12 <shapr> I think Haskell is worth all the work to learn it, but then, I'm here on #haskell
07:20:17 <shapr> so I guess that's obivous
07:20:35 <shapr> vegai: I like that description of monads
07:20:55 * isomer will give it a good run
07:21:13 <shapr> isomer: oh oh, can I give you the intro talk?
07:21:18 <shapr> do you have fifteen minutes?
07:21:21 <isomer> learning new *different* computer languages is very enjoyable, imho
07:21:24 <shapr> or should you be studying?
07:21:34 <isomer> sure - go for it
07:21:37 <shapr> yay
07:21:48 <Darius> All I can say is that most of the time I've been programming I used C++.  Learning CL/Scheme, though I thought and think they are great languages, didn't make me stop using C++, Haskell did.
07:22:07 <shapr> Darius: poignant :-)
07:22:15 <shapr> mind if I quote that?
07:22:37 <shapr> isomer: do you have Hugs or GHC installed?
07:22:41 <isomer> GHC
07:22:41 <Darius> Not at all.
07:22:56 <isomer> shapr: as a quick aside, how do i get emacs to stop leaving backups all over my drive?
07:24:30 <Darius> Use vim ;)
07:24:36 <isomer> don't be silly
07:24:48 <keverets> isomer: (setq *backup-directory* "~/bak")
07:24:55 <vegai> any idea of ICFP-contest results?
07:24:57 <keverets> isomer: or M-x auto-save-mode
07:25:07 <keverets> isomer: or add the equivalent to your .emacs
07:25:23 <isomer> ah. thanks, keverets
07:25:29 <isomer> shapr: sorry, please continue
07:25:54 <shapr> ok, do you have Hugs or GHC installed?
07:25:59 <shapr> haskell-mode would be even better
07:26:14 <MMD|Reading> reverse "Rambutan" . the response is "natubmaR"  no? 
07:26:26 <shapr> MMD|Reading: try it in Hugs or GHCi
07:26:29 <isomer> GHC and haskell-mode are both ready to go
07:26:45 <shapr> ok
07:26:47 <MMD|Reading> heh good idea
07:27:27 <shapr> isomer: 'purely functional' means the language works like a mathematical equation
07:27:45 <shapr> each call to a function can be replaced by the result of that call
07:27:59 <isomer> ok
07:28:23 <shapr> you don't have 'variables' but you do have single-assignment constants
07:28:33 <MMD|Reading> Hah there is an error in the tutorial 
07:28:33 <MMD|Reading> I win
07:28:35 <MMD|Reading> :d
07:29:03 <shapr> you don't have loops exactly but you can do the same thing with recursion and a conditional
07:29:10 <Darius> @eval reverse "Rambutan"
07:29:10 <lambdabot> natubmaR
07:29:34 <MMD|Reading> wtf there should be "'s
07:29:36 <shapr> isomer: have you used higher order functions before?
07:30:15 <isomer> uhm....i don't think so, since i don't know what you're talking about :-^
07:30:28 <shapr> have you used map/filter/reduce in Python?
07:30:38 <isomer> oh, you mean lambdas? sure.
07:31:00 <shapr> a higher order function just means it takes functions as arguments
07:31:03 <shapr> like map
07:31:16 <isomer> sure - do that in smalltalk all the time.
07:31:17 <shapr> @eval map (\x . x + 1) [1,2,3]
07:31:17 <lambdabot> [2, 3, 4]
07:31:31 <reffie> what if you eval evil things?
07:31:41 <Darius> @eval Y not
07:31:46 <lambdabot> out of fuel - use @resume to continue
07:31:47 <shapr> @eval foldr1 (\x y . x + y) [1,1,1]
07:31:48 <lambdabot> 3
07:32:21 <shapr> Eval is a great teaching tool :-)
07:32:49 <Darius> Not if you look at the source code *blech* ;)
07:32:54 <isomer> with you so far, shapr
07:33:09 <shapr> isomer: because of the lambda calculus basis of Haskell, every function takes one argument, and returns one argument
07:33:15 <shapr> (I think that's because of LC at least)
07:33:41 <shapr> so if you write add :: Int -> Int -> Int defined as add x y = x + y
07:33:46 <keverets> well, depending on your point of view you can return two arguments if you return a pair, etc...
07:33:58 <shapr> keverets: yah, but then we hit currying...
07:34:29 <keverets> which is easy with curry and uncurry ;)
07:34:36 <shapr> actually, a tuple is a complex type, so it's still one value really
07:34:48 <shapr> anyways
07:35:07 <shapr> isomer: the symbol -> is the function call symbol (is there a better name for it?)
07:35:19 <shapr> lambdas in Haskel look like (\x -> x + 1)
07:35:21 <ibid> function call? not really
07:35:39 <shapr> type signatures look like add :: Int -> Int -> Int
07:35:39 <ibid> $ is function call symbol if any...
07:35:47 <shapr> so what would you call -> ?
07:35:59 <ibid> -> is the function type constructor
07:36:05 <Darius> exactly
07:36:14 * shapr takes notes
07:36:36 <ibid> of course, it's that only in a type context
07:36:38 <steveh> right
07:36:41 <ibid> not in \x -> ...
07:36:47 <steveh> what would you call it in \x -> ...
07:36:51 <steveh> it's being a .
07:36:51 <shapr> ok, what is it called in a lambda?
07:36:53 <ibid> an arrow :-)
07:36:58 <steveh> heheheh
07:36:59 * shapr laughs
07:37:22 <shapr> isomer: confused yet?
07:37:41 <ibid> in a lambda expression it's essentially punctuation
07:37:46 <isomer> only slightly. so add :: Int -> Int -> Int ...
07:37:56 <isomer> that means a function called add that...
07:37:57 <shapr> the -> in a type signature is right associative, so it's really add :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
07:37:57 <isomer> ?
07:38:22 <shapr> addOne :: Int -> Int ; addOne x = x + 1
07:38:37 <shapr> addOne takes one Int, gives one Int
07:38:43 <isomer> ah, got you. the first Int is the return value, the others are the arguments?
07:38:53 <shapr> nah, other way around
07:39:02 <isomer> okey
07:39:02 <ibid> isomer: add :: Int -> Int -> Int means that add is a name that has the type Int -> Int -> Int (ie. a function that takes an Int and returns a function that takes an Int and returns an Int)
07:39:06 <steveh> the last one is the common idea of "return value"
07:39:24 <shapr> but it doesn't return, it's really about evaluating to something
07:39:37 <steveh> here you go:
07:39:39 <isomer> ibid: ah. i get it now.
07:39:42 <shapr> that confused me a lot at first
07:39:49 <isomer> there are no returns :)
07:40:08 <shapr> yes
07:40:11 <shapr> true
07:40:41 <steveh> the important hurdle is to conceive of functions as entities unto themselves, just like any other value in a program
07:40:44 <ibid> true. when i say "takes an X returns an Y", i really mean "evaluates to an Y given an X as argument"
07:41:11 <isomer> ok. i follow. 
07:41:17 <ibid> but we all use the returning metaphor for convenience :-)
07:41:28 <steveh> so "add" represents a function with signature Int -> Int -> Int
07:41:32 <ibid> i do that even in pure maths quite often
07:41:47 <shapr> so, the type signature of add means that you can put in one Int, and get back a new function that takes one Int and returns one Int
07:41:47 <ibid> steveh: add is a name that has the type Int -> Int -> Int
07:41:52 <steveh> "add 1" represents a function with signature Int -> Int
07:41:52 <shapr> that's partial application
07:42:30 <shapr> addOne = add 1
07:42:36 <ibid> but i'm off
07:42:37 <ibid> bbl
07:42:43 <shapr> since operators in Haskell are just functions with funny names
07:42:51 <shapr> you can do "map (+ 1) [1,2,3]"
07:43:25 <isomer> i see
07:44:04 <shapr> ok, pattern matching is where you write what looks like multiple definitions of a function, and they're tried in order (it reduces to a case expression)
07:44:10 <shapr> length [] = 0
07:44:17 <Darius> Actually, ((+) 1) would've been more accurate.
07:44:18 <shapr> length (x:xs) = length xs + 1
07:44:49 <shapr> I freely admit I'm a 'general idea' kind of guy.
07:44:50 <shapr> :-)
07:45:08 * Darius will not jump in the middle shapr's functions.
07:45:27 <shapr> it's okay with me, I'm glad other people fill in the details
07:45:45 <shapr> lesse, algebraic datatypes are cool too
07:46:04 <shapr> data Seasons = Summer | Fall | Winter | Spring
07:46:49 <shapr> data Tree a = Nil | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
07:47:11 <shapr> with that you can make a tree of Int, tree of Char, you can fill any type into the a
07:47:37 <shapr> I'm not sure I'm giving a coherent picture of Haskell...
07:47:46 <steveh> heh
07:48:10 <shapr> maybe I should show you some source...
07:48:13 <steveh> http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html is a good overview ;)
07:48:17 <isomer> okey
07:48:37 <shapr> first bit of Haskell I wrote -> http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/src/haskell/Mandelbrot-0.1.hs
07:49:45 * Verbed still has that file
07:49:54 <Darius> steveh: Hey, I used that for references at times
07:51:07 * isomer makes bookmarks
07:52:40 <keverets> you may want data Tree a = Nil | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) instead...
07:53:01 <keverets> otherwise it's not too useful, no?
07:54:17 <Darius> It'll have structure, you could use it for paths in a tree.
07:57:32 <shapr> sorry, my boss was distracting me
07:58:06 <shapr> isomer: any questions so far? have the fractured bits shown you anything unusual?
07:58:26 <Igloo> The one you haven't got?  :-)
07:58:28 <isomer> no, i'm alright with this so far. i have at least seen functional programming before, so i'm not lost
07:58:39 <shapr> have you seen purely functional programming before?
07:59:09 <isomer> in a survey course at uni (in about the 14th century, it feels like)
08:00:20 <shapr> referential transparency lets you do partial application, function composition, all sorts of neat tricks like that
08:00:30 <shapr> the downside being that readLn doesn't fit in very well
08:00:49 <Smerdyakov> What does referntial transparency have to do with partial application and function composition?
08:00:50 <shapr> since it doesn't return the same result for the same input
08:00:58 <shapr> Smerdyakov: they're all really cool features ;-)
08:01:05 * Smerdyakov rolls his eyes.
08:01:12 <Marvin--> mmm, coffee
08:01:26 <shapr> ok, I admit, you can do those tricks in procedural languages also, but it's a lot more trouble
08:01:43 <shapr> the Xoltar toolkit for Python does a lot of these things, you should see my Zope code :-)
08:02:15 <shapr> isomer: I thought you weren't much older than me?
08:02:22 <shapr> possibly even younger than me?
08:02:24 <isomer> 34, shapr. you?
08:02:28 <shapr> 31
08:02:42 <isomer> well, you were right - i'm not much older than you 
08:02:54 <shapr> yah, I remember something about that.
08:03:10 <isomer> all my classmates are like...18!!!
08:03:13 <shapr> heh
08:03:14 <isomer> so weirtd
08:03:20 <shapr> that must be weird
08:03:59 <isomer> very nice people, but we're definitely at different life stages ;)
08:04:17 <shapr> yah, important life issues change depending on age
08:04:45 <shapr> do you still mix?
08:04:48 <isomer> yup
08:04:53 <shapr> cool
08:04:56 <shapr> got any new goodies online?
08:05:10 <shapr> oh, speaking of music and haskell....
08:05:20 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/haskore/
08:05:31 <isomer> kinda - me and a couple of buddies do a shoutcast every few days. i'll let you know when we do the next one. 
08:05:34 <shapr> thanks
08:05:47 <isomer> np
08:06:33 <shapr> some of the big differences in Haskell for me are that "type design" is important "combinators" are the coolest thing I've seen yet
08:06:50 <shapr> monads are totally unlike procedural programming
08:08:26 <Darius> It's procedural with first-class higher-order procedures and a effect typing.
08:08:28 <steveh> aah who needs types anyway? :-P
08:10:21 <Darius> Well, assuming most procedural languages allow continuations, backtracking, exceptions in addition to state and you can add more "effects" whenever you want.
08:10:34 <shapr> oh, Haskell is lazily evaluated.
08:10:52 <shapr> I'm beginning to take some parts of Haskell for granted.
08:10:55 <shapr> it shows when I write Python.
08:12:14 <shapr> @seen Heffalump
08:12:14 <lambdabot> Heffalump is in #joy.
08:12:36 <Marvin--> what a traitor!
08:12:46 <shapr> he's probably trying to work
08:12:48 <shapr> I should do that too
08:12:51 <Darius> "Whaddaya mean stack overflow, it was -only- all the -even- integers."
08:23:58 <shapr> @listmodules
08:23:58 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","fact","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]
08:28:18 <shapr> I've been thinking about DynLoading applied to Haskell interpreters
08:29:23 <shapr> seems to me GHCi could take anything typed in interactively if it considered the input string as an anonymous module, compiled it, and dynloaded it
08:29:35 <shapr> are there obvious holes in that thought?
08:31:39 <Darius> Not really, that's basically what it does for well the modules it loads now, except for (obviously) the anonymous part, but just makeup a name.
08:31:49 <Darius> Or have the user set some option.
08:36:38 <shapr> martin_: there are two of you?
08:36:59 <martin_> my computer died...very badly
08:37:00 <shapr> isomer: speaking of strange languages, Joy is spiffy.
08:37:11 <martin_> I'm wondering how the heck "Marvin--" can still stick around
08:37:20 <shapr> because you didn't close the connection
08:37:32 <shapr> you can use /msg nickserv ghost Marvin-- <mypassword>
08:38:10 <isomer> what's joy?
08:38:37 <shapr> @fact joy
08:38:38 <lambdabot> Nothing
08:38:40 <shapr> hrm
08:38:44 <Marvin--> shapr: well, yeah, but shouldn't it time out after a while?
08:38:49 <steveh> it's so cool that it has a whole division devoted to it...
08:39:08 <shapr> http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html
08:39:14 <shapr> Marvin--: yah, but that can be a long time
08:39:22 <Marvin--> damn tcp :)
08:39:41 <shapr> isomer: tiny bit of Joy code: DEFINE approxEqual == 100.0 / rotate [0 =] [pop] [dup rolldown - swap /] ifte > .
08:39:55 <shapr> it's a postfix stackbased concatenative functional language.
08:40:08 <shapr> if Forth and Haskell had a kid...
08:41:00 <Marvin--> subversion really is bliss after cvs
08:41:05 <Marvin--> (no, I still haven't tried darcs)
08:41:15 <shapr> bah, beat me to it.
08:41:16 <isomer> oh, my
08:41:39 <shapr> oh, my hostname works now, I can set up a darcs server!
08:41:42 <isomer> ok -- gotta get some work done. bbl
08:41:43 * shapr boings happily
08:41:45 <shapr> isomer: cya!
08:41:49 * Darius that's what I thought when I used it (SVN)
08:41:56 * isomer is away: studying
08:42:23 <Marvin--> Darius: did you get a warm fuzzy feeling from seeing "M   ." too? ;)
08:42:42 <shapr> colocated bandwidth is happiness. 700Kb/s
08:42:48 <Igloo> :-)
08:44:04 <Marvin--> it's really nifty that many of the svn commands can operate both on a repository and on a working directory
08:47:56 * shapr creates a darcs-server
08:48:33 <Marvin--> shapr: yay, how do I check out? :-)
08:48:49 <shapr> I warn you, it involves GPG ;-)
08:48:55 * shapr watches Marvin-- explode
08:49:21 <shapr> oh, that's only for committing changes
08:49:45 <Marvin--> I'm pretty sure I've used GPG more than you :)
08:49:57 <shapr> I am 100% sure you have.
08:50:58 <shapr> Marvin--: I'm reading the directions, trying to figure out how to check out
08:58:08 * Marvin-- blames uae for the total computer crash
08:58:33 <shapr> uae?
08:58:41 <Marvin--> an amiga emulator
08:58:47 <Marvin--> I wanted to play dune2 :)
08:58:48 <shapr> oh
08:58:54 <shapr> ok, I think I've figured it out.
08:59:52 <shapr> if you want to get the repository, "darcs get http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs"
09:00:13 <shapr> if you want to get any new changes, use pull instead of get
09:01:14 <Igloo> What's the difference?
09:01:27 <shapr> for what?
09:01:34 <Igloo> Between pull and get
09:01:42 <shapr> get is for new repos
09:01:46 <shapr> cvs co
09:01:49 <shapr> pull is for cvs up
09:01:51 <Igloo> Yes, but what does it do differently?
09:01:56 <shapr> I have no clue :-)
09:02:13 <Igloo> You give the URL when using pull too, right? Or did I misunderstand?
09:02:23 * shapr dunno
09:02:26 <shapr> I'll try it.
09:03:22 <Marvin--> whee, darcs has a bash-completion file :)
09:03:33 <Marvin--> darcs pull should be enough in you're in the WD, right?
09:18:55 <shapr> darcs get grabs the repo
09:18:59 <shapr> darcs pull updates the repo
09:19:33 <shapr> as soon as I get email working, you'll be able to push changes to the repo
09:20:52 <shapr> Marvin--: does it work?
09:21:17 <Marvin--> shapr: get:ing worked
09:21:21 <shapr> cool
09:21:32 <shapr> ok, lemme make a small change....
09:21:40 <Marvin--> $ darcs pull
09:21:40 <Marvin--> No remote changes to pull in!
09:21:53 <shapr> oh, I have to get the email part working first so I can push a change
09:22:05 <shapr> what's your favorite MTA?
09:22:05 <shapr> postfix?
09:23:09 <Marvin--> I only do local delivery, I think I've got exim or whatever was the default in potato ;)
09:24:50 <shapr> well, I'll try exim...
09:25:02 <Marvin--> I think exim pretty much sucks for anything that's not local delivery
09:27:25 <shapr> yay, it works
09:27:35 <MMD|Reading> damn Haskell is nice
09:28:01 <shapr> yes, I agree.
09:28:20 <Marvin--> well...
09:28:25 <Marvin--> that's why we're on #haskell, isn't it? :)
09:28:42 <MMD|Reading> yes that's why I said it too :)
09:29:02 * Marvin-- ponders if he can write a mini-IFC
09:29:02 <MMD|Reading> But you have to know your math
09:29:09 <shapr> what's IFC?
09:29:19 <MMD|Reading> well not Math but math syntax
09:29:20 <Marvin--> shapr: it's still Strakt's Infinite Filing Cabinet ;)
09:29:49 <Marvin--> I'm pondering if I should do persistence with SQL, XML or another TLA
09:29:52 <shapr> oh, right :-)
09:30:00 <shapr> OOP
09:30:02 <shapr> WTF
09:30:10 <shapr> HOF
09:30:12 <Marvin--> Oop!
09:30:15 <Marvin--> (I've just read Microserfs)
09:30:33 <shapr> I still haven't read that.
09:30:58 <Marvin--> then I won't spoil anything :)
09:31:12 <Marvin--> oh bugger, train tickets
09:31:38 <shapr> ?
09:32:02 <Marvin--> I'm going to see some relatives tomorrow, gotta buy train tickets
09:32:11 <shapr> oh
09:32:53 * Marvin-- makes a mental note to - again - berate the sj.se people for using low-grade encryption
09:33:06 <shapr> ok, gpg public key import seems to have worked...
09:33:15 <shapr> lemme see if I can push a change from here to there...
09:33:52 <Marvin--> have you imported my key?
09:34:03 <shapr> no, tell me what it is...
09:34:14 <Marvin--> 9C04F456
09:34:22 <shapr> I used --export "shae@ScannedInAvian.com" to get my key exported
09:34:28 <Marvin--> oh
09:34:29 <shapr> how do I get yours in?
09:34:34 <Marvin--> I can do that from my site?
09:34:41 <shapr> I assume so
09:34:42 <Marvin--> oh wait, you mean gpg --export
09:34:46 <shapr> yes
09:35:01 <shapr> can I use gpg to look it up instead?
09:35:02 <shapr> that would be spiffy
09:35:04 <Marvin--> you can do gpg --recv-keys 9C04F456 --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net
09:35:10 <shapr> ok, I'll try that.
09:35:24 <shapr> does --recv-keys == --import ?
09:35:29 <Marvin--> yes
09:35:34 <shapr> spiffy
09:35:40 <Marvin--> you'll get my key and can send me sekhrut mails
09:35:43 <shapr> heh
09:35:58 * Marvin-- remembers the "conan" emote on our mud :)
09:37:10 * Marvin-- enthusiastically points at the wall and bellows 'SEKRUT DHOOR!'
09:37:12 <shapr> it's not working :-(
09:37:34 <Marvin--> not working, as in what?
09:37:44 <shapr> gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
09:38:01 <shapr> gpg --keyring /var/lib/darcs/repos/hlibs/allowed_keys --no-default-keyring --keyserver www.keys.eu.pgp.net --recv-keys 9C04F456
09:38:06 <shapr> that's the cmdline I'm using
09:38:42 <reffie> baby if you give it to me.. i'll give it to you.. as long as you want..
09:38:42 <Marvin--> wwwkeys
09:38:44 <Marvin--> not www.keys
09:38:48 <shapr> doh!
09:38:55 <Marvin--> reffie: Bustah Rhymes
09:39:07 * shapr feel like an eejit
09:39:10 <shapr> ok, that worked
09:39:11 <reffie> omg
09:39:32 <shapr> Marvin--: so now you should be able to push changes
09:39:36 <shapr> though I haven't tried it yet
09:40:40 * shapr tries it
09:41:14 <shapr> ok, darcs whatsnew shows my changes
09:42:28 <shapr> Marvin--: ok, darcs pull ?
09:43:07 <shapr> oh I should set up the cgi as well
09:43:31 <Marvin--> reffie: ?
09:43:39 * shapr bounces
09:43:48 <Marvin--> shapr: hmm, it says no changes
09:43:49 <shapr> do you see the changes I pushed Marvin--?
09:43:50 <shapr> bah humbug
09:43:57 <Marvin--> maybe I need the url
09:44:03 <shapr> I dunno
09:44:07 <shapr> maybe so
09:44:23 <shapr> what about "darcs whatsnew" in the same dir with _darcs ?
09:44:31 <Marvin--> no changes
09:44:34 <shapr> fooey
09:45:00 <Marvin--> hmm
09:45:55 <shapr> can you try to push a change?
09:46:08 <Marvin--> er, just modify a file and darcs push?
09:46:17 <shapr> darcs record first
09:46:32 <shapr> then "darcs push --sign http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs"
09:47:58 <Marvin--> patch name is what's used for log messages, or...?
09:48:07 <shapr> heck if I know
09:48:11 <Marvin--> or do we have a patch naming policy? :)
09:48:16 <shapr> not yet
09:48:24 <shapr> gotta figure this thing out first :-)
09:48:40 <Igloo> Is PGP the only authentication mechanism it provides?
09:48:56 <shapr> Igloo: what do you mean?
09:48:57 <Marvin--> oh, right, record commits locally, push sends my patch to you
09:49:02 <shapr> yup
09:49:10 <shapr> darcs is *thoroughly* distributed.
09:49:20 <shapr> you can conditionally pull patches from other people in fact.
09:49:25 <Marvin--> there, pushed
09:49:30 * shapr bounces excitedly
09:49:31 <Marvin--> ... I think :)(
09:49:39 <Igloo> It just strikes me as a bit heavyweight
09:49:55 <Marvin--> agh, no...
09:50:33 <shapr> Igloo: how so?
09:50:37 <Marvin--> annoying that I have to enter the mail address all the time, where do I configure it?
09:50:54 <Marvin--> um
09:50:56 <shapr> I don't know that either :-)
09:50:59 <Marvin--> I need outgoing mail to push patches?
09:51:17 <shapr> yah, it mails the signed patch to hlibs@ScannedInAvian.org
09:51:28 <Marvin--> I'm getting delivery failures, which isn't strange, since my exim is only configured for local delivery, which I SAID before
09:51:31 <Igloo> I'd have though the startup and signing time would be long enough to irritate. Maybe it's quicker than I think, though.
09:51:31 <Marvin--> so screw this
09:51:36 <shapr> Marvin--: sorry :-(
09:51:59 <shapr> Igloo: darcs is closer to bitkeeper, many changes can be atomic
09:52:29 <Marvin--> I can understand the idea to use transport protocols that already exist, subversion tried to do that with WebDAV, but quickly "had" to implement something that could be easily tunneled over ssh
09:52:40 <shapr> well, mention that on the list :-)
09:52:48 <shapr> or I can ask
09:53:09 <Marvin--> since I could use svn+ssh out of the box when I'd installed the subversion debian package I didn't have to worry about WebDAV
09:53:49 <Marvin--> so... what the heck does a 'pull' do? A 'push' sends a mail, but what does pull do?
09:54:21 <shapr> it gets new changes
09:54:27 <Marvin--> yes, but *how* :)
09:54:35 <shapr> via http?
09:54:39 <Marvin--> okay
09:54:43 <shapr> what part of how do you mean?
09:54:55 <Marvin--> annoying that you need so *many* external things
09:55:06 <shapr> well, you don't really
09:55:15 <Marvin--> to cooperate, yes you do
09:55:18 <shapr> hm
09:55:38 <Marvin--> I think I'll stick to svn for now
09:55:49 <shapr> outgoing mail doesn't seem too difficult to me :)
09:56:33 * Marvin-- shrugs
09:56:38 <shapr> but I do see your point.
09:56:43 <Marvin--> I've never needed it, so I haven't configured it
09:56:49 <shapr> some sort of http push would be nice
09:56:53 <Marvin--> and not every O/S has /usr/lib/sendmail
09:56:57 <shapr> yah, true
09:57:15 <shapr> darcs is developed on debian though
09:57:46 <shapr> the manual even says "darcs-createrepo is only guaranteed to work on debian, no idea about other systems"
09:57:53 <Marvin--> since the smtp port is firewalled on the student network, I have very limited use for non-local delivery
09:58:13 <shapr> that makes sense.
09:58:17 <shapr> hi Radek
09:58:35 <shapr> Marvin--: sorry to put you through the trouble :-)
09:59:07 <Marvin--> no worries :)
09:59:15 <Marvin--> "anything to get rid of cvs" ;)
09:59:22 <shapr> yah, gotta try all the new stuff
09:59:29 <shapr> cvs.sf.net is my main irritation lately
09:59:34 <shapr> it's soooo slow
09:59:39 <shapr> even for developers
09:59:43 <Marvin--> well, that's not cvs's fault, it's the lack of hardware
09:59:48 <shapr> yah, I know.
09:59:56 <Marvin--> sf.net doesn't scale well :)
09:59:59 <shapr> heh, truly
10:00:05 <shapr> pushing patches sounds more scalable
10:00:10 <shapr> though I dunno
10:00:25 <shapr> there have been some serious speed issues mentioned on darcs-users
10:00:37 <Marvin--> well, svn sends patches client-to-server too
10:00:49 <Marvin--> cvs only sends patches server-to-client for some unfathomable reason
10:01:03 <shapr> someone tried to stuff the fptools tree into darcs, and some several hundred hours later they gave up
10:01:10 <Marvin--> heh
10:01:19 <shapr> oddly enough, the same process works in less than an hour if you only check in a few files at a time.
10:01:27 <Marvin--> weird
10:01:31 <shapr> yah, really
10:02:04 <shapr> even so, I think darcs is the going to be the most publically used Haskell app for awhile
10:02:09 <shapr> the user list is hopping
10:03:44 <shapr> I'm interested to know if laziness/space leaks will make any difference
10:04:06 <shapr> I think space leaks are the only scary part of Haskell for commercial programming
10:06:37 <shapr> dangit
10:06:44 <shapr> I found out why my changes didn't push
10:07:20 <shapr> lessee if this fixes it...
10:08:50 <shapr> Marvin--: if you're still around, can you try to darcs pull now?
10:09:28 <shapr> hrm
10:09:30 <Marvin--> okay
10:09:38 <shapr> does it work??
10:09:39 <keverets> space leaks?  problems with garbage collection, or something else?
10:09:39 * shapr bounces
10:09:43 <Marvin--> no changes
10:09:46 <shapr> arrrghh
10:10:12 <shapr> keverets: laziness leaks
10:10:40 <keverets> shapr: ah.
10:10:51 <Marvin--> shapr: David Sands and Jörgen Gustavsson have done some nifty work on space complexity in lazy languages, IIRC
10:11:14 <shapr> for example, I wrote a mailing list searcher that just opened all the files, parsed all the files into keywords, and built a finitemap from that
10:11:25 <shapr> the downside was that first, it opened all the files
10:11:36 <Darius> Any links or do I have type all 20 some of those letters into google?
10:11:59 <Marvin--> Darius: was that directed to me or to someone else?
10:12:00 <shapr> Darius showed me how to fix it btw :-)
10:12:10 <Darius> you
10:12:14 <shapr> he looked at the code and said "you need to put $! right there"
10:12:17 <shapr> and tada, it worked.
10:12:19 <Marvin--> Darius: http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~gustavss/
10:12:19 <Marvin--> shapr: heh
10:12:37 <shapr> I was impressed. :-)
10:12:39 <Marvin--> shapr: sounds like when you have a prolog guru tell you "you need a cut right there"
10:12:50 <Marvin--> and you go "uh, okay"
10:13:01 <shapr> part of my problem is that I still think procedurally too much :-/
10:13:02 * Marvin-- has taught some basic prolog, HAH
10:13:09 <shapr> I expect the first part of a loop to happen first.
10:14:56 * Marvin-- tries to remember how to create a new mysql table, or something
10:15:07 <shapr> why are you using mysql?
10:15:28 * Marvin-- shrugs
10:15:30 <Marvin--> it's what I have installed
10:15:34 <Marvin--> I suck at configuring postgres
10:15:34 <shapr> Marvin--: do you have time to try it one more time? :-)
10:15:41 <shapr> you don't have to configure anything
10:15:44 <shapr> just install it.
10:15:45 <Marvin--> shapr: no remote changes
10:15:54 <shapr> hm
10:16:13 * shapr sets up the darcs cgi thingy
10:17:01 <shapr> aha, it really is in there!
10:17:09 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs
10:17:10 <Marvin--> I want to configure it so a certain user can access the database without password
10:17:59 <shapr> my patch successfully pushed
10:18:43 <Marvin--> hmm, what locale should postgres use?
10:18:54 <shapr> Marvin--: tried it with the full deal? "darcs pull --verbose http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs" ?
10:19:04 <shapr> use unicode?
10:19:10 <Marvin--> Should I run it in a utf-8 locale if I want unicode strings? or will the adaptor take care of that?
10:19:21 <Marvin--> it warns me that anything non-C will be slower
10:19:29 <shapr> do you need blinding speed?
10:19:41 <Marvin--> no, but it's a question of doing the Right Thing
10:19:51 <shapr> I don't know
10:19:56 <shapr> you could ask on #postgresql
10:19:57 <shapr> they're helpful
10:20:09 <shapr> you know more about the Right Thing than I do :-)
10:20:19 <Marvin--> ah, wait, it's only for collating and dates and stuff
10:20:28 <Marvin--> but I do wonder
10:21:34 <shapr> so, anyone else wants push access to the hlibs darcs repo?
10:21:49 <Marvin--> shapr: I still wonder how to get your latest push pulled...
10:22:05 <shapr> did you try what I suggested above?
10:22:10 <shapr> full url and --verbose?
10:22:28 <isomer> omg this is cool: http://www.yamaha-motor.co.jp/eng/papercraft/
10:22:37 * isomer is away: I'm busy
10:22:41 * isomer is back (gone 00:00:04)
10:22:51 * shapr grins
10:24:07 <Marvin--> shapr: still says no new patches
10:25:00 <shapr> weird
10:25:09 <shapr> I wonder why...
10:26:26 * shapr tries making another change
10:28:10 <Marvin--> oh great, now I somehow got old config files that were still in /etc/postgres from an ancient installation :-/
10:29:05 <shapr> try apt-get -uf remove postgresql --purge
10:29:10 <shapr> then install again
10:29:12 * Darius is more of a purist (single color, square paper only folding).
10:29:13 <shapr> I've had that problem in the past
10:29:22 <Marvin--> ugh
10:29:23 <Darius> Though I'm kind of interested in wetfolding.
10:31:29 <Marvin--> guh, no, they actually were from that date in the package
10:31:41 <Marvin--> the installation messages are kinda misleading, grrr
10:32:00 * Marvin-- ponders flaming "Oliver Elphick"
10:34:00 <shapr> I think something might be wrong with my email setup
10:34:51 <Marvin--> hmm, I wonder how to create a separate database for this project and still use local access
10:35:31 <Marvin--> ah, there
10:35:36 <shapr> createdb
10:35:39 <Marvin--> well yes
10:35:44 <Marvin--> it's the config I was worried about
10:36:02 <Marvin--> but using only local access, it was pretty easy
10:41:24 * shapr rips out exim and installs postfix
10:41:41 <Marvin--> told you so
10:42:40 <shapr> oh, I think I found the problem....
10:42:48 * shapr feels a right idiot
10:44:32 <Marvin--> I can be a left idiot if you like
10:45:33 * shapr grins
10:47:06 <Marvin--> select (str_values.obj_id) from types, fields, str_values where types.name = 'foo' and fields.type_id = types.oid and fields.name = 'bar' and str_values.field_id = fields.oid and str_values.value = '42';
10:47:08 <Marvin--> good grief
10:47:17 <shapr> ?
10:47:22 <Marvin--> an attempt at a mini-IFC
10:47:25 <shapr> oh
10:47:49 <Marvin--> the idea is to have a table of "types", a table of "objects", a table of field names and tables for string values, int values and references
10:48:08 <Marvin--> so this sql query was looking an object id given the type name and the value of a field
10:48:10 <shapr> you're making an object database on top of a relational one, right?
10:48:14 <Marvin--> yes
10:48:37 * shapr grumbles
10:48:43 <shapr> Diagnostic-Code: X-Postfix; Command died with status 1:
10:48:43 <Marvin--> hmm, I just realized something
10:48:43 <shapr>     "/usr/lib/darcs-patcher". Command output:  Fail: permission denied Action:
10:48:43 <shapr>     Failed to create temporary file darcs Reason: Permission denied
10:48:59 <Marvin--> I wonder if my contract at Strakt allows me to do this :)
10:49:16 <shapr> probably not
10:49:22 <shapr> unless you're going to give it to them aftewards
10:49:27 <Marvin--> otoh, the design of the IFC is published
10:50:56 <shapr> I wonder why it gets permission denied
10:51:35 <shapr> er
10:51:38 <Marvin--> maybe I should have a look at zodb instead
10:51:48 <shapr> yah, good idea
10:52:18 <Marvin--> err... no separate debian package for it?
10:52:28 <shapr> don't think so
10:52:29 <Marvin--> I will have to install *zope* to just get zodb? :-(
10:52:43 <Marvin--> (insert "eeeeeew" here)
10:52:48 <shapr> even then, it's probably better to get the separate package from zope.org
10:52:52 <shapr> the zope debs suck imho
10:53:03 <shapr> suck bad
10:53:10 <Marvin--> fuck
10:53:21 <shapr> iirc, zodb is distributed separately though
10:53:44 <shapr> why wouldn't the patcher be allowed to created a temp file?
10:53:54 <Marvin--> I hate installing things by other means than debian packages
10:53:58 <shapr> me too!
10:54:03 <shapr> *especially* zope
10:54:13 <shapr> which makes me strongly wish the zope debs didn't suck so bad.
10:55:02 <Marvin--> file bugs
10:55:21 <shapr> how do you file a "this package sucks" bug?
10:55:44 <shapr> <lambdabot> wrong type (<<[] Char>>) in ModuleState
10:55:46 <shapr> yikes
10:55:57 <shapr> @fortune
10:55:58 <lambdabot> This is your fortune.
10:55:58 <Marvin--> I think you need more specific complaints ;-)
10:57:13 <shapr> @fortune
10:57:13 <lambdabot> Winnuke in one line?  No problem:
10:57:13 <lambdabot> perl -MIO::Socket -e 'IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr=>"bad.dude.com:139")->send("bye",MSG_OOB)'
10:57:13 <lambdabot> And formatted so it's a little easier to read:
10:57:14 <lambdabot>         #!/usr/bin/perl
10:57:16 <lambdabot>         use IO::Socket;
10:57:18 <lambdabot>         IO::Socket::INET
10:57:20 <lambdabot>                 ->new(PeerAddr=>"bad.dude.com:139")
10:57:22 <lambdabot> [3 @more lines]
10:57:24 <shapr> @more
10:57:24 <lambdabot> wrong type (<<[] Char>>) in ModuleState
10:57:27 <shapr> hm, fun
10:57:49 <Marvin--> whoa, importing ZODB messes with the global namespace?
10:57:55 <shapr> yah, so does zope
10:58:07 <Marvin--> good grief
10:58:36 <shapr> zope is powerful, but ugly :-)
10:58:54 <shapr> any ideas why darcs-patcher wouldn't be able to create a temp file?
11:01:14 <Marvin--> I guess zodb reads stuff lazily?
11:01:19 <shapr> I don't know
11:01:27 <Marvin--> I mean, it can't very well keep the entire db in memory...
11:03:19 <Marvin--> which is faster of using file storage and berkely storage, you think?
11:03:54 <shapr> for ZODB?
11:04:05 <Marvin--> yeah
11:06:20 <shapr> I would guess berkely
11:08:11 * Marvin-- disgustedly watches his /opt directory grow
11:09:44 <Marvin--> wtf, it threw in a *whole lot of crap* directly in the site-packages directory
11:09:51 <shapr> who did?
11:09:55 <shapr> zodb?
11:09:56 <Marvin--> the ZODB setup
11:09:59 <shapr> oh
11:10:14 <vegai> is your python sys.prefix /usr?
11:10:15 <Marvin--> $ ls /opt/ZODB/3.1.2/lib/python2.2/site-packages/|wc -l
11:10:16 <Marvin-->      18
11:10:17 <shapr> I still can't figure out why darcs-patcher can't create a temp file....
11:10:26 <Marvin--> this should be 1!
11:10:28 <vegai> ohh, there
11:10:36 <Marvin--> what kind of broken design is this
11:10:41 <vegai> where should they go then?
11:10:46 <shapr> it's zope, it's ugly
11:10:52 <Marvin--> they should be in a sub directory of their own, a package
11:11:09 <Marvin--> I wanted to find just a ZODB directory in the site-packages directory
11:11:45 <Marvin--> my god this is horrible
11:11:47 * Marvin-- rants some more
11:12:46 <vegai> ah, indeed
11:13:49 <Marvin--> there is a lot of stuff in the ZODB directory, but why didn't it put *everything* there?
11:14:17 <vegai> someone didn't get distutils
11:14:45 <vegai> get/comprehend
11:14:48 * Marvin-- grumbles
11:15:08 <Marvin--> no, I mean, seriously, the docs talk about "from Persistence import ...", not "from ZODB.Persistence import ..."
11:15:17 <Marvin--> good thing I'm calling my directory "persistence" and not "Persistence" :-(
11:17:21 <Marvin--> er
11:17:24 <Marvin--> this ain't good
11:17:26 <shapr> aha, it's using c_mkstemp
11:17:31 <shapr> does that create files in /tmp ?
11:17:46 <Marvin--> if called with "/tmp/foo.XXXXXX"
11:18:01 <shapr> what if called with "XXXXXdarcs" ?
11:18:07 <Marvin--> iirc you have to supply a path
11:18:23 * isomer is suffering from partial brain shutdown.
11:18:30 <Marvin--> er, the man page for mkstemp that I have here states that the *last* six characters must be XXXXXX
11:18:32 <shapr> isomer: lack of coffee?
11:18:44 <Marvin--> I think I'm going to make some dinner
11:18:57 <isomer> that and too much studying. learning about digestion just isn't that exciting
11:19:14 <shapr> sounds nifty to me
11:19:40 <isomer> mmmm pepsin, trypsin, carboxypeptidase, salivary amylase, gastric lipase... 
11:19:48 <isomer> still sound like fun? :)
11:19:51 <shapr> yah sure
11:20:05 * isomer is a masochist
11:20:20 <shapr> where does NO activation fit into digestion? :-)
11:20:36 <isomer> as in nitrous oxide?
11:20:39 <shapr> yup
11:20:47 <andersca> arr
11:20:48 <isomer> ah, i think i know this... let me think for a sec
11:20:50 <andersca> RRRrrrRRRR!!!
11:20:51 <andersca> Avast!
11:20:58 <shapr> andersca: are you pirating software?
11:21:09 <Marvin--> Arrr matey
11:21:36 <andersca> you cn only use r, ! and Avast
11:21:37 <andersca> can
11:22:45 <isomer> shapr: actually, i don't know. i know that NO functions in the brain to block neurotransmitters, and as a vasodilator, and it mediates macrophages and neutrophils, but i don't know what it does in digestion.
11:23:14 <shapr> so, if postfix pipes into /usr/lib/darcs-patcher and then it calls mkstemp with "darscXXXXXX" where should the file be created?
11:23:32 <isomer> maybe it interferes with dopamine reuptake or something and initiates digestion, but that's totally a guess
11:23:38 <shapr> isomer: I was just thinking of how drowsy I get after a big meal, just vasodilation, nothing exciting :-)
11:24:11 <shapr> isomer: ok, trivia question, how is NO activation related to email spam?
11:24:14 <isomer> oh, that's because your parasympathetic nervous system shunts all this blood to your stomach
11:24:36 <isomer> if you inhalie, you stop caring about how much spam you get? :)
11:24:41 <shapr> haha
11:24:59 <shapr> what medical product that's related to NO activation is often mentioned in spam?
11:25:17 <isomer> beats me
11:25:33 <shapr> viagra
11:25:41 * vegai almost said that.
11:26:01 * vegai boings depressingly.
11:26:09 <isomer> vasodilation, huh?
11:27:35 <shapr> viagra makes blood vessels sensitive to NO activation again.
11:27:46 <isomer> huh
11:27:50 <shapr> yup
11:27:59 <isomer> so...you actually read your spam mail, huh, shapr?
11:28:16 <shapr> no, I read that in Science News
11:28:22 <shapr> I have a weekly subscription.
11:28:31 <shapr> you should try it, it's great.
11:28:48 <shapr> http://www.sciencenews.org/
11:28:49 <isomer> brb
11:30:15 <isomer> cool - thanks
11:30:25 <shapr> their online only stuff is good too
11:30:38 * Marvin-- is making pasta with dijon tuna sauce, mmm
11:58:34 <shapr> hi Heffalump 
11:58:39 <Heffalump> It's the WEEKEND!
11:58:42 <shapr> yay!!
11:58:57 <shapr> hey, wanna try darcs?
11:59:10 <Heffalump> yes.
11:59:35 <shapr> darcs get http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs
11:59:58 <shapr> if you'll tell me the fingerprint of your public gpg key, I'll add you to the pushable keyring
12:00:01 <Marvin--> shapr: have you sorted out the tempfile stuff for push?
12:00:07 <shapr> no, still trying :-(
12:00:09 <shapr> any ideas?
12:00:11 <Heffalump> that doesn't sound very secure :-)
12:00:13 <Marvin--> :(
12:00:13 <Marvin--> no
12:00:20 <Heffalump> it's key id 80883801. Igloo has signed it.
12:00:25 <shapr> spiffy
12:00:36 <Marvin--> Heffalump: not less secure than saying "here's your password"
12:00:51 <Heffalump> true
12:00:56 <Marvin--> Heffalump: you simply sign checkins with gpg, pretty neat
12:00:57 <shapr> plus the trust medium is really irc anyway
12:01:10 <Marvin--> yeah
12:01:10 <shapr> at least, for hlibs :-)
12:01:34 <Heffalump> fair point
12:01:44 <Marvin--> well, if we sign keys in Uppsala (and if I can get there... well, conference plans are off since we're past deadline) we can have a *real* web of trust!
12:01:48 <Heffalump> so is it going to run in parallel with CVS for a bit, or what?
12:01:55 <shapr> I dunno
12:02:04 <shapr> I just want to play around with it first
12:02:07 <Marvin--> Heffalump: we have to figure out how to push/pull without getting errors first :P
12:02:10 <shapr> yah, really
12:02:12 <Heffalump> ah :-)
12:02:24 <shapr> hey, maybe you can tell me how to fix this:
12:02:31 <shapr> Diagnostic-Code: X-Postfix; Command died with status 1:
12:02:31 <shapr>     "/usr/lib/darcs-patcher". Command output:  Fail: permission denied Action:
12:02:31 <shapr>     Failed to create temporary file darcs Reason: Permission denied
12:02:45 <Heffalump> where did it try to create it?
12:02:45 <shapr> I grabbed the source of darcs, found Lock.lhs
12:02:47 <Marvin--> shapr: is the mkstemp parameter hard coded?
12:03:00 <shapr> what do you mean by hardcoded?
12:03:12 <Marvin--> is it a string in the source that says "foo" or can you change it in a config file?
12:03:22 <Marvin--> i.e., do you have to recompile to fix it?
12:04:14 <Marvin--> eek, zapping tv channels is scary
12:04:26 <shapr> go here http://abridgegame.org/cgi-bin/darcs?darcs* go down to Lock.lhs
12:04:53 <shapr> at the bottom of that file is mkstemp
12:05:03 <shapr> I'm pretty sure that's where the error is
12:05:19 <shapr> it looks like it's creating the temp file in the wrong place to me
12:05:30 <shapr> any second opinions?
12:05:41 * Heffalump waits for that to download
12:05:46 * Marvin-- found a way too young "Sheridan" again :)
12:06:04 <Marvin--> oh god, I think I've seen parts of this episode
12:06:06 <shapr> er, waitasec...
12:06:18 <shapr> no, I still think I'm right
12:06:19 <Heffalump> episode of what?
12:06:40 <Marvin--> Heffalump: How the West Was Won
12:07:22 <Marvin--> eek! William Shatner!
12:07:31 <shapr> run away!
12:07:41 <andersca> mr
12:07:43 <andersca> mr tambourine man
12:07:44 <andersca> mr tambourine man!
12:08:16 <shapr> Marvin--: does mkstemp *always* create in /tmp ?
12:08:52 <Marvin--> shapr: I think you have to supply the path yourself
12:08:58 <Marvin--> the full path
12:09:09 <shapr> I think that's the problem then.
12:09:32 * Heffalump waits for darcs get http://abridgegame.org/repos/darcs to do something
12:09:33 <Marvin--> isn't that what I said earlier?
12:09:44 <Heffalump> supply it how?
12:09:56 <Heffalump> as a parameter to mkstemp?
12:10:18 <Marvin--> yeah
12:10:19 <Heffalump> so what does Lock.lhs do, since I might get old and die before it downloads
12:10:24 <shapr> http://abridgegame.org/cgi-bin/darcs?darcs* is the "darcsweb" interface
12:10:25 <Heffalump> oh no, it just did
12:10:33 <shapr> oh, it's being slow
12:10:36 <Marvin--> char buf[] = "/tmp/foo.XXXXXX" ; mkstemp(buf);  in C
12:10:59 <shapr> so why hasn't anyone else complained about it?
12:11:09 <Marvin--> good question
12:11:12 <shapr> oh, it has zsh completion, mmm!
12:11:36 <shapr> hrm, where do I put zsh completion files?
12:11:38 <Heffalump> wouldn't it just use cwd if there's no absolute path?
12:11:46 <Heffalump> which is probably the problem, postfix not giving it a cwd it can write to
12:11:46 <Marvin--> yes
12:11:49 <Marvin--> exactly
12:12:02 <Heffalump> probably other MTAs happen to be nicer about cwd
12:12:14 <shapr> change the .forward to |cd /tmp && /usr/bin/darcs-patcher ?
12:12:18 <shapr> will that work?
12:12:30 <Marvin--> relying on having a cwd you write to is broken
12:12:41 <Heffalump> yes, it ought to
12:12:48 <Marvin--> shapr: er, I don't think so... maybe with  |(cd /tmp && ...)
12:12:53 <shapr> ok
12:12:58 <Marvin--> or does it pass the string through system?
12:13:00 <Heffalump> oh, yes.
12:13:23 <shapr> ok, I'll try pushing a patch again
12:13:46 <shapr> ok, pushed
12:13:56 * shapr waits patiently
12:14:41 <Marvin--> no remote changes
12:14:52 <shapr> and no bounce either
12:15:08 * shapr waits more
12:15:19 <shapr> I want a darcs-log now
12:16:03 <shapr> Aug  1 21:13:55 raven postfix/local[8424]: CBB70C8013: to=<hlibs@ScannedInAvian.org>, relay=local, delay=0, status=deferred (\Command died with signal 11: "")

12:16:38 <andersca> ramen
12:16:41 <shapr> noodles
12:16:46 <Marvin--> mmm, noodles
12:16:55 * andersca sips some wine
12:16:57 * andersca hacks on wine
12:16:58 <shapr> anyways, is there some other way I can force it to cd into /tmp ?
12:16:58 <Marvin--> andersca: you're being awfully incoherent today
12:17:03 <Marvin--> andersca: ah, that'd be it ;)
12:17:05 * andersca whines
12:17:23 <Marvin--> shapr: |/some/script and put cd /tmp && ... in the script?
12:17:24 <andersca> not really incoherent, cmp raven->ramen
12:17:31 <shapr> yah, I'll try that
12:17:46 <Marvin--> andersca: I meant in general, not just the last minute ;)
12:17:49 <andersca> oh :)
12:17:56 <andersca> haven't been drinking wine for that long though :)
12:18:09 * Marvin-- digs up some raspberry sorbet from the fridge, yay
12:18:15 <shapr> Marvin--: will that respect the passing of input or whatever the mailpiping stuff does?
12:18:28 <Marvin--> shapr: no idea whatsoever
12:18:40 <Marvin--> shapr: can it get worse? :)
12:19:26 <shapr> good point
12:20:28 <shapr> ok, push again...
12:20:51 <Marvin--> the essence of software engineering :) "if it can't get any worse, try anything" :)

12:23:19 <Marvin--> kinda sucks that it's this hard to get it to work
12:23:35 <shapr> I'll send email to the list
12:23:40 <Marvin--> er.... /v\ar/lib... ?
12:24:02 <shapr> I'm using most -w
12:24:14 <shapr> so it's escaping where my screen wraps
12:24:15 <Marvin--> oh
12:25:53 <Marvin--> hrrrm, I don't really like the idea of having to inherit everything from ZODB.something.or.other
12:26:10 <Marvin--> kinda breaks my idea of backend-neutral code :-/
12:26:50 <shapr> zodb is somewhere between exciting and terrifying
12:27:15 <shapr> I wonder if there's something else I can do to force changing to /tmp first
12:27:29 * shapr reads darcs-patcher.lhs
12:28:05 <Marvin--> I think exciting and terrifying are orthogonal when it comes to zodb
12:30:21 <shapr> is there the possibility that the hlibs user can't write to /tmp ?
12:30:34 <Marvin--> then your system is broken :)
12:30:37 <shapr> no, that doesn't seem to be the problem.
12:33:23 <Marvin--> hmm, I really should configure apache to run what little php crap I have as cgi so I can get them to run as the owner
12:35:36 * shapr grumbles
12:35:49 <shapr> darcs-patcher reads from stdin
12:36:09 <shapr> does the (cd /tmp && /usr/libs/darcs-patcher) pass stdin correctly?
12:37:01 <shapr> hi stratocaster
12:37:10 <shapr> how's code?
12:37:16 <stratocaster> Hi
12:37:35 <Marvin--> shapr: don't know
12:38:14 <Marvin--> $ echo foo | (cd /tmp && read bar && echo $bar)
12:38:14 <Marvin--> foo
12:38:15 <Marvin--> should do
12:38:28 <stratocaster> anybody know if there's a way to specify an "include" dir for haddock? Am using the gentoo-ebuild haddock-0.5, and it doesn't find Prelude, et al
12:38:53 <shapr> I think there is a way to do that
12:39:13 <shapr> but I also think that standard GHC installs will have a haddock.gz lying around
12:39:25 <shapr> and that will include the interfaces in binary form, and will be much simpler to deal with
12:39:42 <shapr> or maybe it's libraries.haddock.gz ?
12:40:19 <shapr> ah, I have /usr/share/doc/ghc6-doc/html/base/base.haddock.gz and several others
12:40:55 <shapr> do you have those?
12:41:04 <stratocaster> Don't see any of those around. It may be that the gentoo ebuilds don't install them.
12:41:09 <shapr> could be
12:41:31 <shapr> do you have the haddock built html docs?
12:41:43 <stratocaster> I figured there'd be something like "haddock -I/opt/ghc/blah -h Foo.hs"
12:41:48 <shapr> if so, the interfaces may be in the same dir
12:42:36 <stratocaster> I do. But it seems to just the .html and .css, no interface files that I can see
12:43:15 <shapr> btw, why are you trying to include the Prelude?
12:43:21 <stratocaster> Ah well, I think this just means the ebuilds need some work.
12:43:35 <shapr> I think kosmikus is the gentoo haskell guy
12:44:01 <stratocaster> Well, just so that the signatures and such would linkify for "System" and "Prelude" functions.
12:44:57 <stratocaster> Right now, I get warnings from haddock about not being able to find module Prelude, module Char, etc. So it seems that it's trying
12:45:39 <shapr> you could limit the exports
12:45:45 <shapr> that would keep haddock happy
12:46:07 <shapr> I dunno a good way to linkify the system stuff though
12:46:16 <shapr> admittedly, I haven't read the Haddock docs
12:46:18 <shapr> just some of the sources
12:48:54 <shapr> Marvin--: er, would the line I used before be equivalent to echo foo | (cd /tmp && echo) ?
12:49:28 <shapr> should I use (cd /tmp && read thingy && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher $thingy)  ?
12:49:32 * shapr tries that
12:49:48 <shapr> Marvin--: where did you get read?
12:50:26 <Marvin--> huh?
12:50:31 <Marvin--> read is a shell thingy that reads from stdin
12:50:48 <Marvin--> if darcs-patcher reads from stdin, it should just be  |(cd /tmp && darcs-patcher)
12:50:53 <Marvin--> "One of the only good things to come out of 9/11 is that Members of Congress have been forced to use email as a preferred method of communication. Paper mail and knickknacks have become harder to get into the Capitol."  heh
12:51:17 <shapr> Marvin--: in that case, wouldn't echo foo|(cd /tmp && echo) work also?
12:52:29 <shapr> argh
12:54:27 <shapr> grr
12:56:24 * shapr bangs head on immovable object
12:56:36 <Marvin--> no, because echo doesn't read from stdin
12:56:46 <shapr> oh
12:58:47 <shapr> hi Arnia
12:59:04 <shapr> has anyone else tried to create a pushable darcs repo and succeeded?
12:59:05 <Arnia> Hey shapr :)
12:59:20 <shapr> I wonder if there are some magical postfix settings....
12:59:47 <shapr> oh, .forward is procmail?
13:00:10 <Marvin--> no
13:00:16 <Marvin--> .procmailrc is procmail... :)
13:00:22 <shapr> oh
13:04:03 * Marvin-- grabs a beer from the fridge
13:04:12 <Marvin--> my fridge and freezer are unusually well stocked :-)
13:04:56 <shapr> you think switching MTAs would fix this?
13:06:56 <Marvin--> no idea
13:07:10 <reffie> i wont spend another night alone..
13:07:26 <Marvin--> reffie: ... good for you?
13:07:36 <reffie> :)
13:07:38 <shapr> getting a roomie? :-)
13:07:44 <reffie> heh
13:09:53 <Marvin--> yay, Total Rekall on TV
13:10:08 <reffie> heh
13:10:43 <Marvin--> er, Recall
13:10:52 <Marvin--> too much Mortal Kombat and KDE
13:11:12 <reffie> hehe
13:17:38 <shapr> any other good MTAs other than postfix?
13:17:41 <shapr> I could try exim again
13:17:55 <peren> I like postfix a lot...
13:19:08 <peren> darcs, that like arch...that strange distributed version system
13:19:15 <shapr> peren: yah
13:19:27 <shapr> you know how to get my .forward stuff to be executed in /tmp ?
13:19:29 <keverets> exim4's not bad... better than 3.
13:19:55 <peren> I read all the info on that...it just didn't seem reasonable to me...
13:20:07 <peren> what you running in the .forward?
13:20:38 <shapr> just |/usr/lib/darcs-patcher but it wants to create a temporary file
13:21:06 <peren> and what is darcs-patcher? a shell file or exec?
13:21:07 <shapr> I think it tries to create the temp file in whatever $PWD it's called in
13:21:19 <shapr> it's an elf binary
13:21:40 <peren> ah, then you should switch that call into a shell script and just cd first before calling it
13:21:57 <peren> or chain a cd to the front of that command
13:22:18 <shapr> what would that look like?
13:22:31 <shapr> "|(cd /tmp && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher)" ?
13:23:24 <peren> or perhaps |`cd /tmp`/usr/lib/darcs-patcher
13:23:32 <peren> your way looks more reasonable :)
13:23:54 <peren> or just make it a shell script and the world is yours to pown
13:24:27 <Marvin--> we tried that...
13:25:26 <peren> could try and run strings on the elf binary and see if there are some unknown configuration options
13:25:39 <peren> or just tweak to source to use /tmp
13:25:55 <peren> but the shell script should work if it is just doing $pwd
13:26:28 <shapr> 2003-08-01 22:24:25 19igRt-0002mo-00 ** |(cd /tmp && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher) <hlibs@ScannedInAvian.org> D=userforward T=addre\ss_pipe: "(cd" command not found for address_pipe transport
13:26:53 <Marvin--> shapr: all right, so shell script it is
13:26:54 <peren> cd /tmp;/usr/lib/darchs?
13:27:05 <peren> oh, |
13:27:46 <peren> no options for darcs-patcher?
13:28:05 <shapr> not that I know of
13:28:24 <peren> strings it and see what it says :)
13:29:09 <shapr> well, I have the source
13:34:51 <shapr> #! /bin/sh
13:34:51 <shapr> cd /tmp && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher
13:34:59 <shapr> is there something wrong with that?
13:35:16 <shapr> should I be explicitly reading stdin?
13:36:36 <peren> in a script..prolley
13:36:46 <shapr> how so?
13:37:05 <shapr> cd /tmp && read foo && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher $foo
13:37:34 <Marvin--> shapr: that will only read one line
13:37:44 <shapr> oh
13:37:50 <Marvin--> or perhaps just one word, I don't know if it depends on $IFS or whatever
13:38:05 <Marvin--> what does darcs-patcher do?
13:38:26 <peren>  /usr/lib/darcs-patcher <$0 on the  command line one you had?
13:38:56 <peren> no
13:39:59 <shapr> http://abridgegame.org/cgi-bin/darcs?darcs* about 2/3 down the page is darcs-patcher.lhs
13:40:52 <shapr> after it creates a temp file, it changes to the repos dir
13:41:19 <shapr> er
13:41:49 <Marvin--> my_repodir <- return "repo"
13:41:50 <Marvin--> omg
13:41:59 <Marvin--> why oh why
13:42:12 <shapr> it really is in /var/lib/darcs/repos/hlibs/repo
13:42:31 <shapr> so it sounds like it's trying to create temp files in  /var/lib/darcs/repos/hlibs/ right?
13:42:50 <Marvin--> I don't know, have you made it print the cwd or what?
13:42:54 <shapr> no
13:43:02 <shapr> how do I do that?
13:43:10 <shapr> the shell script silently does nothing
13:43:15 <Marvin--> guh
13:44:52 <shapr> does $0 pass stdin?
13:45:00 <peren> no...
13:45:13 <shapr> how can I pass stdin?
13:45:13 <peren> I wasthinking of something else
13:45:56 <peren> like foo >/dev/null 2>1
13:46:09 <peren> $STDIN ?
13:46:13 <shapr> does that work?
13:46:28 <peren> dunno..don't shell script much :)
13:46:41 <shapr> neither do I
13:46:43 <Marvin--> shapr: it should pass stdin!
13:47:18 <Marvin--> just a simple script saying   #!/bin/sh \n cd /tmp \n /.../darcs-patcher   and darcs-patcher should get all the input the script gets
13:47:19 <shapr> just "cd /tmp && /usr/lib/darcs-patcher" should pass stdin?
13:47:28 <Marvin--> yes
13:47:53 * shapr tries one more time
13:48:42 <andersca> http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/images/pirate.jpg
13:49:21 <shapr> cute
13:50:10 <shapr> uh
13:50:21 <shapr> hm
13:51:23 <Marvin--> andersca: heh
13:51:34 <andersca> rrRRRR!!! Avast!!! !! RRRrr
13:52:03 <Marvin--> kinda like the irc keyboard
13:52:11 <Marvin--> but with less buttons
13:52:48 <Igloo> What do non-ergonomic keyboards for pirates look like?
13:53:07 <shapr> they have lots of holes for hooks
13:53:29 <peren> and the letter R is in four places.
13:53:30 <andersca> RRrr
13:55:14 <Marvin--> speaking of keyboards... french keyboards are completely insane
13:55:26 <Marvin--> I mean... azerty..wtf?
13:56:24 <peren> spanish keyboards kill me...
13:56:54 <peren> a special Alt Gr key so you can get the @
13:57:24 <peren> so the 2 key has 2, " and @ on it
13:58:24 <Marvin--> so do Swedish keyboards
13:58:43 <Marvin--> we have more letters, so shift isn't enough...
13:58:43 <shapr> and finnish keyboards
13:59:37 <peren> the english alphabet has 23 letters....no one needs more :) 
13:59:50 <shapr> which english alphabet?
13:59:54 * peren smirks.
14:00:03 <peren> was kidding...
14:00:24 <peren> the one without zy and x
14:00:25 <shapr> maybe that's the ebonics alphabet where large people are phat
14:00:43 <peren> heh, an I is here in dis channel
14:03:30 <Marvin--> yay, the tripple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6... or, well... Mars anyway
14:03:51 <shapr> ??
14:04:00 <Marvin--> you haven't seen Total Recall?
14:05:12 <shapr> I don't remember that part at least.
14:08:03 <Marvin--> he goes to the Last Resort, a brothel
14:08:09 <Marvin--> and there's a three-breasted woman there
14:08:12 * andersca ordered a new t-shirt today
14:08:37 <shapr> oh, hey
14:09:05 <shapr> You have to be a bit careful when creating this repo since if you just run a darcs get on a local repository owned by a different user, darcs will use hard links for the patch files, which may not work since you won't have the right to change them later.
14:09:24 <shapr> I wonder if that could be it?
14:09:29 <shapr> andersca: which t-shirt?
14:09:37 <andersca> the glow-in-the-dark red meat one
14:09:43 <shapr> wow, nifty
14:09:54 <shapr> how can I tell if I have hardlinks or not?
14:10:32 <andersca> http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/buyproducts/prodpage_glowt.html
14:10:33 <andersca> this one
14:10:42 <andersca> shapr: write a python program to do it!
14:10:54 <andersca> oh sorry,
14:10:56 <andersca> I mean a haskell program
14:11:01 <shapr> heh
14:11:03 <Marvin--> shapr: ls -l will show you link count
14:11:13 <shapr> huh?
14:11:24 <shapr> oh
14:11:31 <Marvin--> <perm> <link count> <owner> <group> ...
14:11:54 <andersca> mvc for your file system!
14:12:34 <shapr> the *.hs files are all 1
14:12:38 <shapr> so I guess that's not it.
14:14:00 <Marvin--> the ownership and permissions on files and directories are all right?
14:14:04 <shapr> I think so
14:14:30 <shapr> everything has "nogroup" whatever that means
14:14:45 <shapr> drwxr-xr-x    5 hlibs    nogroup      4096 Aug  1 17:48 lambdabot
14:14:49 <shapr> that looks sane, yes?
14:15:55 <Marvin--> I guess
14:16:02 <Igloo> What's the problem?
14:16:37 <shapr> Diagnostic-Code: X-Postfix; Command died with status 1:
14:16:37 <shapr>     "/usr/lib/darcs-patcher". Command output:  Fail: permission denied Action:
14:16:38 <shapr>     Failed to create temporary file darcs Reason: Permission denied
14:17:06 <shapr> it looks like darcs-patcher is trying to create a temp file in whatever is $CWD when postfix calls it
14:17:09 <Igloo> Have you found where it's trying to create it? If not, strace -f
14:17:21 <shapr> how do I sensibly strace -f postfix?
14:17:43 <shapr> wrapper shell script for darcs-patcher maybe?
14:18:02 <Igloo> You can attach to the daemon with -p. I don't actually know if -f will DTRT then, but it ought to
14:18:27 <Igloo> But if you know it's trying to use $CWD then that's presumably the problem
14:18:49 <Igloo> I assume that's ~postgres or something?
14:19:11 <Igloo> Is there no way to specify a temporary directory in the configuration?
14:19:18 <shapr> not that I can see
14:19:26 <Marvin--> *postgres*?
14:19:34 <Igloo> What sort of file is /usr/lib/darcs-patcher?
14:19:35 <Igloo> IM postfix
14:19:42 <shapr> the source of darcs-patcher is about 2/3 down the page here -> http://abridgegame.org/cgi-bin/darcs?darcs* 
14:19:55 <shapr> darcs-patcher.lhs
14:20:18 <shapr> I think the problem is really in Lock.lhs, where it calls mkstemp with str++"XXXXXX" but doesn't specify a dir
14:21:53 <Igloo> That looks plausible - so try patching it and recompiling?
14:22:48 <Marvin--> it's just strange that nobody else has the problem...
14:22:51 <shapr> yah, that's probably the easiest solution
14:22:57 <shapr> yah, that is strange.
14:23:17 <Igloo> It could be that other MDAs start elsewhere, or maybe the issue is whether TMP or something is defined
14:23:33 <Igloo> Even being in /var/spool/mail would work
14:23:55 <Marvin--> ugh, yeah, true
14:25:04 <Marvin--> Igloo: mkstemp doesn't use $TMP afaik
14:27:38 <shapr> what's the secret deb building command?
14:28:11 <Igloo> dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc -b
14:28:44 <Igloo> Or maybe something equivalent and shorter involving debbuild
14:29:26 <Marvin--> debuild -uc -us
14:29:37 <Marvin--> if you have devscripts or whatever the package is called
14:29:51 <Marvin--> build-essential perhaps
14:30:59 <Marvin--> ... this is where the movie is getting too silly
14:31:07 <Igloo> Do you have to ask debuild for a source package explicitly then?
14:31:27 <Marvin--> eh? No, just run it from the directory with the debian directory in?
14:31:49 <andersca> I wanna buy a corpse
14:31:54 <shapr> andersca: eh?
14:32:05 <shapr> esprit de corpse?
14:32:24 <andersca> www.distefano.com
14:33:17 <shapr> yuk
14:33:39 <andersca> :)
14:41:44 <Marvin--> ... interesting ... site
14:42:17 <andersca> http://www.nightmarefactory.com/ is pretty interestingtoo
14:43:19 <Heffalump> shapr: why would you want to change existing patch files later?
14:43:33 <shapr> huh?
14:45:10 <Heffalump> the local hard links thing
14:45:24 <Heffalump> AIU the way darcs works, you just create new patch files, you don't change existing ones
14:45:37 <shapr> right
14:45:41 <shapr> hi Lunar^ 
14:45:52 <Lunar^> If you want to follow a crazy attempt (maybe it'll last for the weekend) to have a pure Haskell operating system : http://wise.homedns.org/blog/
14:46:05 <Lunar^> hi shapr 
14:47:32 <shapr> Lunar^: you could use the Runtime Loader for "kernel modules"
14:47:52 <phubuh> interesting
14:47:56 <Heffalump> how do you define "pure Haskell"?
14:48:11 <Heffalump> surely you'll need _some_ machine code, for example
14:48:13 <Lunar^> shapr: it started as doing something like JNode but with less assembly
14:48:42 <shapr> never heard of JNode
14:48:45 <Lunar^> Heffalump: modifying GHC backend to add the needed special x86 instructions
14:48:47 <Lunar^> jnode.sf.net
14:48:47 * shapr googles
14:48:53 <phubuh> i am working on an o'caml-based operating system, actually
14:50:04 <Lunar^> phubuh: any webpaeg ?
14:50:21 <phubuh> Lunar^: no, i haven't really gotten started yet
14:50:29 <Marvin--> "Status: Nothing works (yet)" heh
14:53:54 <peren> um..o'caml? isn't that oo perl?
14:54:21 <phubuh> peren: haha
14:54:46 <peren> I am wrong, right?  please say I am wrong....
14:54:54 <Marvin--> you're very wrong
14:54:55 <phubuh> you definitely are
14:54:56 <Marvin--> it's oo caml :)
14:55:20 <phubuh> i thought you were making fun of the fact that o'caml is kind of ad hoc and impure, like perl
14:55:29 <phubuh> so in that, they're slightly similar
14:55:38 <peren> thank god...we used to joke in college about writing a POS (piece of s**T) perl o/s
14:55:45 <phubuh> haha
15:04:37 <Marvin--> I'm off to bed
15:04:44 <phubuh> night!
15:04:50 <andersca> too late
15:04:50 <andersca> ;)
15:04:59 <andersca> hmm, I wonder if I can use a list for sound output
15:11:35 <vegai> phubuh: what OS is that? anything ready yet?
15:12:03 <phubuh> vegai: nope, definitely not.
15:12:26 <vegai> there's another that sort of project going around... can't remember its name right now
15:13:10 <phubuh> yeah, i remember reading about it. i think they shifted focus to something more general than just a kernel partly written in ocaml, which is what i'm writing.
15:13:15 <vegai> yes
15:13:18 <vegai> that's the one
15:38:35 <Heffalump> anyone know where SyntaxPolice's distutils prototype is?
15:54:14 <andersca> shapr: http://people.redhat.com/~jhealy/eclipse/
16:25:16 <Smerdyakov> Does anyone how to get a monospaced ^ character into a LaTeX document? :\
16:33:25 <Igloo> Ought to be fine inside any verbatim mode
17:28:39 * shapr yawns
17:28:53 <shapr> Heffalump: I think he sent it to the libraries list
17:28:58 <shapr> and I think I have a copy around here somewhere
17:29:05 <Heffalump> oh, I could look back and find it then
17:29:14 <Heffalump> I thought he only advertised it on here, but I'm probably wrong
17:29:32 <shapr> I'm pretty sure he sent it to one of the lists
17:31:42 <shapr> Lunar^: it's cool to see the info being updated on your blog :-)
20:49:20 * shapr throws bits, bytes, and nibbles into the air
21:08:48 <shapr> du maste sova nu!
21:09:15 <shapr> nej, jag maste sova nu...
21:12:23 <shapr> [Texass]: so, where are you from?
21:12:49 <[Texass]> shapr: i'm from ireland. you?
21:12:58 <shapr> I'm from Alabama.
21:13:04 <[Texass]> not Texas though ;)
21:13:07 <shapr> aww
21:13:19 <shapr> at the moment I'm quite a ways north of you though.
21:13:28 <[Texass]> nice
21:13:47 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
21:14:03 <[Texass]> yeah
21:14:10 <shapr> What do you think so far?
21:14:51 <[Texass]> i#m trying to
21:15:00 <shapr> trying to think?
21:15:06 <shapr> :-)
21:15:09 <[Texass]> sheesh! it's like greek rolled into russian
21:15:09 <[Texass]> ;)
21:15:13 <shapr> heh
21:15:27 <shapr> are you learning Haskell for school?
21:15:45 <[Texass]> i just can't wrap my head around it
21:16:30 <[Texass]> no, i'm out of school. 26
21:16:45 <Smerdyakov> I wish I could be out of school when I'm 26.
21:16:48 <Smerdyakov> We'll see if I make it.
21:16:49 <shapr> are you a professional programmer?
21:16:49 <[Texass]> i got this program to solve
21:17:01 <shapr> what sort of program?
21:17:51 <[Texass]> no, i'm more a web developer, but training to become a 3d artist
21:17:53 <shapr> I'm going to sleep soon, so I can only answer short questions.
21:18:18 <Smerdyakov> [Texass], what programming languages do you know well?
21:18:27 <shapr> but if you ask your questions, others may be able to answer as well
21:18:34 <[Texass]> lol
21:18:47 <[Texass]> not much really
21:19:28 <Smerdyakov> It sounds like you ought to learn Haskell like someone who had never programmed before would.
21:19:39 <Smerdyakov> Have you read Rex Page's "Two Dozen Short Lessons in Haskell"?
21:19:51 <[Texass]> lemme check
21:19:56 <[Texass]> i got a couple of tuts etc.
21:20:23 <[Texass]> yeah, got the two dozen one in pdf format
21:20:27 <[Texass]> 2 files
21:20:42 <[Texass]> i actually have a iotype question
21:20:55 <[Texass]> i manage to read a line of text out of a separate text file
21:21:15 <[Texass]> but how can i pass that line of text to another section in my haskell source?
21:21:33 <Smerdyakov> Why are you doing IO so early?
21:21:57 <Smerdyakov> In stark opposition to "hello world first" and such with imperative programming languages, IO in Haskell is somewhat of an "advanced topic" in an ideal learning order.
21:22:06 <[Texass]> i'm busy with this challenge and part of solving it is to test a text file with 3500 different codes
21:22:18 <Smerdyakov> Well, then you should use a language you already know.
21:22:21 <shapr> ah, you're solving the x-something site
21:22:26 <shapr> trying to get to level 8
21:22:33 <Smerdyakov> IO is not something for a Haskell novice.
21:22:36 <shapr> yah, we've had that one before.
21:22:39 <[Texass]> yes shapr
21:22:46 <Smerdyakov> shapr, what is this?
21:22:49 <[Texass]> has this question been asked here before?
21:22:54 <shapr> yes it has
21:23:00 <[Texass]> :)
21:23:04 <shapr> and according to the rules of x-whatever you're sposed to solve it yourself
21:23:11 <shapr> we can help you learn the language
21:23:17 <shapr> but we can't help you solve the challenge
21:23:19 <[Texass]> i know we're not supposed to ask for help, but nowhere do i get a solution in a tut or on the web
21:23:24 <shapr> what's the url again? I've forgotten...
21:23:25 <Smerdyakov> What is x-whatever?
21:23:30 <[Texass]> mod-x
21:23:33 <shapr> ah, yes
21:23:59 <shapr> Smerdyakov: http://www.mod-x.co.uk/main.php
21:24:09 <shapr> it's relatively entertaining.
21:24:17 <[Texass]> it kinda is addictive!
21:24:30 <[Texass]> i'm about to bang my head against the table
21:24:31 <shapr> I think Haskell is addictive :-)
21:24:38 <[Texass]> i've been at the challenge for 2 months now
21:24:48 <snaky> programming is addictive per se
21:24:53 <shapr> snaky: I agree
21:24:53 <[Texass]> and i'm stuck at converting the iotype to normal type
21:25:06 <shapr> snaky: have you been here before?
21:25:13 <shapr> [Texass]: that's because you can't
21:25:22 <[Texass]> i got a couple of tuts showing sample code on how to convert, but they don't work!
21:25:23 <shapr> you need to go in the other direction
21:25:40 <[Texass]> in the other direction?
21:25:42 <snaky> shapr, no, at least I not remember
21:25:49 * [Texass] looks to the other direction and see nothing
21:26:10 <[Texass]> ugh, maybe i should just give up
21:26:12 <shapr> snaky: well then, welcome to #haskell, are you learning Haskell? or looking for other users?
21:26:26 <shapr> hej phubuh 
21:26:33 * snaky think it's a good skill - have ability to see nothing
21:26:34 <phubuh> hej shapr!
21:26:42 <shapr> varfor du inte sover?
21:26:42 <[Texass]> lol
21:27:10 <shapr> varfor jag inte sover? :-)
21:27:15 <phubuh> :-)
21:27:28 <phubuh> jag fÃ¶rsÃ¶ker att fÃ¥ Xcursor i XFree86 4.3.0 att fungera :/
21:27:33 <snaky> shapr, just shuffling around, before sleeping :)
21:27:41 <shapr> yah, same here
21:28:02 <[Texass]> shapr: what did u mean by i need to go in the other direction?
21:28:28 <shapr> [Texass]: don't convert io to normal, instead...
21:28:40 <[Texass]> convert normal to io?
21:28:45 <shapr> try it
21:29:03 <[Texass]> now i'm confused.
21:29:09 <shapr> snaky: well, this is a good place to learn Haskell
21:29:14 <shapr> it's a fun way to program.
21:29:26 <[Texass]> i need to run the codes from the file through a series of tests that came in a haskel file
21:29:26 <shapr> phubuh: gör du debian?
21:29:38 <phubuh> shapr: japp
21:29:41 <[Texass]> this test seem to only accept normal type
21:29:47 <shapr> yes, I've seen the challenge.
21:29:56 <[Texass]> and it will work?
21:30:04 <shapr> I don't know
21:30:11 <shapr> I don't remember the solution
21:30:22 <[Texass]> lol, i don't want the solution
21:30:42 <[Texass]> i want to solve it on my own
21:30:46 <shapr> phubuh: and your Xcursor isn't working?
21:31:01 <phubuh> shapr: nope
21:31:01 <[Texass]> oh well, i'll just have to copy and paste 3500 separate lines to test
21:31:12 <shapr> phubuh: that's odd
21:31:18 <[Texass]> thanks anyways guys
21:31:19 <phubuh> shapr: do you know of anyone with a working Xcursor on debian?
21:31:22 <[Texass]> thanks shapr
21:31:25 <shapr> sure
21:31:29 <[Texass]> cheers
21:31:41 <shapr> phubuh: I'm confused, isn't it just a cursor that moves around on the screen?
21:31:45 <phubuh> if so, which 4.3 debs did they use? :-)
21:31:46 <shapr> am I missing so much sleep?
21:32:08 <phubuh> oh, no, Xcursor is an extension added in 4.3 that allows for 24-bit RGBA PNG cursors
21:32:16 <shapr> wow, sounds cool!
21:32:20 <phubuh> indeed
21:32:40 <snaky> it looks really nice
21:34:12 <shapr> snaky: if you come back later today, I'd be happy to give you the half euro tour of Haskell :-)
21:34:21 * isomer has a working xcursor on gentoo...
21:34:27 <shapr> at the moment my bed is calling me in a really loud voice
21:35:09 <shapr> @yow
21:35:09 <Strike> phubuh: I have a working xcursor in debian
21:35:10 <lambdabot> If elected, Zippy pledges to each and every American
21:35:10 <lambdabot>  a 55-year-old houseboy...
21:35:14 <snaky> shapr, do you think begin with monadic IO? :)
21:35:33 <shapr> snaky: hah, you know something already
21:35:48 <snaky> :)
21:35:49 <shapr> snaky: at least, you know where you should not start :-)
21:36:06 <Strike> hmm, no XCursor in the extensions listed when I run xdpyinfo though
21:36:44 <phubuh> Strike: ooh, interesting
21:36:54 <Strike> but I do have transparent cursors
21:37:00 <Strike> with drop shadows and everything :)
21:37:11 <phubuh> did you install a 4.3 deb?
21:37:14 <Strike> s/transparent/translucent/
21:37:14 <Strike> yeah
21:37:16 <shapr> wow, I want to see screenshots
21:37:17 <Strike> way back when
21:37:23 <Strike> shapr: cursors don't show in screenshots :/
21:37:31 <Strike> unless you know of a magical way to make them do so
21:37:39 <shapr> fooey
21:37:40 <phubuh> which deb?
21:37:43 <snaky> shapr, I had some fun lately while reading http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html
21:37:49 <Strike> phubuh: Daniel Stone's
21:37:53 <Strike> from penguinppc.org
21:37:54 <phubuh> oh, that's what i'm using
21:38:01 <Strike> oh, you have to set the cursor theme
21:38:16 <phubuh> i have
21:38:21 <shapr> snaky: wow, your amazon wishlist is larger than mine.
21:38:22 <Strike> update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme
21:38:23 <Strike> oh
21:38:27 <phubuh> oh
21:38:37 <Strike> I use the whiteglass one
21:38:39 <phubuh> igloo:/usr/share/icons/osx# update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme
21:38:40 <phubuh> No alternatives for x-cursor-theme.
21:38:43 <Strike> hmm
21:39:08 <isomer> g'night. bed calls
21:39:14 * isomer is away: sleepy time
21:39:14 <shapr> snaky: I have to ask *why* Delaware laws?
21:39:22 <snaky> shapr, I've use some patented pen^H^H^Hwishlist-enlargement drug...
21:39:32 * shapr laughs
21:39:37 <Strike> phubuh: it's in xlibs-data here
21:39:41 <Strike> [ddipaolo@quinn ~]% dpkg -S whiteglass.theme
21:39:41 <Strike> xlibs-data: /etc/X11/cursors/whiteglass.theme
21:40:05 <phubuh> whoa
21:40:16 <phubuh> apt-get install xlibs-data wants to remove a *LOT* of x apps
21:40:28 <Strike> heh
21:40:28 <phubuh> and the entirety of gnome
21:40:35 <snaky> shapr, How-to get your own Delaware corporation, etc. :)
21:40:42 <shapr> snaky: I don't understand.
21:40:43 <Strike> ii  xlibs-data     4.3.0-0ds4     X Window System client data
21:40:47 <Strike> and I have gnome, of course
21:40:53 <phubuh> actually, it wants to remove x-window-system entirely
21:40:58 <shapr> admittedly, I've never been to Delaware (though I have lived in many US states)
21:41:08 <Strike> phubuh: apt-cache policy xlibs-data
21:41:15 <Strike> make sure it's trying to install a 4.3 deb
21:41:29 <shapr> snaky: you have a very cool wishlist
21:41:31 <snaky> shapr, try for example, www.delcorp.com
21:41:38 <phubuh> ah, i'm trying a dist-upgrade, it wants to install xlibs-data among other things
21:41:48 <phubuh> (and it doesn't want to remove the whole internet)
21:41:54 * Strike prefers just using aptitude for these things
21:42:24 <shapr> don't do dist-upgrade unless you're really upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1 
21:42:27 <shapr> or something like that
21:42:32 <Strike> or you don't mind things breaking
21:42:39 <snaky> shapr, wishlist isn't the ideal thing to achieve what one wish to read at all, because most part of items obviously have been buyed yet and removed from it
21:42:50 <phubuh> apt-get works fine for most of the stuff i do with debian, and these situations are pretty rare, so i never get inspired to learn aptitude :/
21:42:54 <phubuh> shapr, strike: oops
21:42:59 <shapr> aptitude is good
21:43:01 <Strike> phubuh: but aptitude is so nice ... 
21:43:08 <phubuh> yeah, it seemed nice
21:43:13 <shapr> dist-upgrade is bad
21:43:18 <shapr> :-)
21:43:23 <Strike> marking packages as auto-installed makes for such a slim, everything-on-here-is-something-I-need-no-cruft-allowed system
21:43:36 <phubuh> auto-installed?
21:43:39 <Strike> yeah
21:43:49 <shapr> snaky: have you written any Haskell code lately?
21:43:51 <Strike> normally, when you install A and it needs B and C, it just installs B and C, right?
21:43:58 <Strike> well, when you remove A, it leaves B and C
21:44:17 <Strike> but, aptitude "remembers" that B and C weren't explicitly installed, and marks them auto-installed
21:44:30 * shapr writes a book "tips of the apt-get masters"
21:44:36 <Strike> so when you remove A, the (and I'll switch to programmer jargon here) refcounts of B and C go to zero and they get gc'ed
21:44:42 <Strike> :)
21:44:49 <phubuh> ooh, that rules
21:44:52 <snaky> shapr, not really, only had some playing with O'Caml :)
21:44:54 <Strike> so, it's like gc for apt :)
21:45:04 <shapr> snaky: lazy evaluation is fun
21:45:07 <Strike> phubuh: NOW you see the light ;)
21:45:13 <phubuh> indeed
21:45:16 <shapr> snaky: fib = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)
21:45:18 <snaky> shapr, currying too :)
21:45:38 <Strike> phubuh: the catch is that you have to do all installs with aptitude, but since it's a drop-in replacement for "apt-get install" ("aptitude install" instead), that's fine
21:45:53 <snaky> shapr, but call-with-continuation maybe isn't
21:45:54 <phubuh> oh, i didn't know that. thanks!
21:46:10 <Strike> I just wish you could do apt-get build-dep and apt-get source with it
21:46:25 <Strike> and I also wish it allowed you to attach comments to each package so you can remember why you installed them :)
21:46:25 <shapr> Strike: it's open source :-)
21:46:34 <Strike> shapr: ssshhhh I'm pretending I don't know that
21:46:40 * shapr grins
21:46:41 <Strike> lalalalalalalala I can't hear you lalalalalalalala
21:46:56 <shapr> snaky: you read TheOriginalWiki ?
21:47:31 <snaky> shapr, almost sure I didn't. what is that? Oh, gonna check at google...
21:47:43 <phubuh> http://c2.com/
21:47:57 <shapr> snaky: you'll like it, it beats your wishlist for cool stuff.
21:48:12 <snaky> 'Google adds approximately 100 to your IQ'(c)Bob Metcalf
21:48:19 <shapr> http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?MentalStateCalledFlow
21:48:26 <shapr> snaky: I've been saying that forever
21:49:08 <snaky> Bob are wise enough, yeah :)
21:49:26 <Strike> phubuh: so if you want to make The Switch(tm), the first thing you do after firing up aptitude is go through all the installed packages and mark anything you don't explicitly want on your system no matter what as auto-installed (hit 'M' on the package name), and then do "go" (g) to see what it'll remove and confirm with another "go" (g again) if it looks okay
21:49:43 <shapr> http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?SoftwareHasShape
21:49:52 <phubuh> i'll do that when i get this xcursor deal working
21:49:53 <phubuh> :)
21:50:00 <Strike> cool
21:50:23 <phubuh> that would even give me an excuse to remove all the junk i don't use
21:50:32 <snaky> shapr, mmm... I've seen some books about 'The Flow', by man with long-long last name...
21:50:35 <shapr> snaky: my web page on TheWiki: http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ShaeErisson
21:50:42 <phubuh> as in, things i installed explicitly, but don't want anymore
21:50:51 <shapr> read TheWiki, it is good.
21:50:59 <phubuh> i should create a home node
21:51:37 <snaky> shapr, 10x for link
21:51:45 <shapr> snaky: sure, it's good stuff.
21:51:48 <shapr> now I have to sleep.
21:51:50 * shapr falls over
