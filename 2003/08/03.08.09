01:35:52 <andersca> hej Marvin--
01:36:32 <Marvin--> hejhej
01:36:52 * Marvin-- drops support for python 1.5 in pyopenssl
01:37:03 <Marvin--> screw red hat :-)
01:37:13 <andersca> um
01:37:18 <andersca> red hat are using 2.2
01:37:29 <Marvin--> not in RHN, afaik
01:37:47 <Marvin--> that is, RH have stuff implemented in python that still use python 1.5
01:37:55 <Marvin--> I don't mean that the default python package is 1.5
01:38:13 <Marvin--> and they're using pyopenssl
01:38:30 <Marvin--> right now it feels tempting to drop support for python 2.1 too as the cyclic gc api is different in 2.1 and 2.2+ :-/
01:39:33 <andersca> ah
02:22:02 * Marvin-- is a good boy and dput:s
06:39:52 <Marvin--> andersca: can I complain about nautilus to you? ;)
06:41:16 <Marvin--> andersca: it seems to have severe problems cooperating with autofs :-/
06:48:00 <Marvin--> hmm, it would be nifty if nautilus could check if a certain directory is in /etc/fstab and offer a "Mount" option
06:50:55 <phubuh> that should be pretty easy
06:51:29 <phubuh> speaking of which, is there a clean way to run cvs versions of stuff in debian without being mean to the package manager?
06:52:51 <Marvin--> depends on what you mean... either you can build a local package that provides and conflicts with the official debian package to ensure that it won't be "upgraded" without you noticing
06:53:04 <Marvin--> or you can just do a make install installation somewhere... that's what I do when I'm lazy
06:54:28 <o3> unknown symbol `_MyObject_zdfzuzumochazuclasszuMyObject_closure'
06:54:31 <o3> i love errors like that
06:54:37 <Marvin--> zuzu :-)
06:54:46 <phubuh> ah, of course -- i can just keep a local build in my home directory or something
06:55:16 <Marvin--> if you need to satisfy dependencies, you can use equivs, but I don't really recommend it
06:57:47 <Marvin--> going to reboot to gameos now and install B&W and see how fast I get tired of it this time :-)
07:17:46 * o3 hoorays at his ReifyType module
07:18:54 <Darius> as in TH?
07:19:14 <o3> Darius: yeah, i just implemented a reifyType function.  works for monomorphic types
07:19:23 <o3> or rather, implemented one a while ago, just updated it so it really does work now :)
07:42:28 * o3 ponders why Language.Haskell.THSyntax.Typ doesn't derive Eq
07:42:43 <o3> wonder if it's worth bothering the mailing list about that
07:46:17 <Darius> Do any of them derive Eq?
07:48:02 <o3> no, just Show
07:48:41 <o3> i wonder how i add ExportF to the compiler
07:50:11 <o3> eh, TH mailing list has been quiet anyway.  might as well ask :)
07:50:29 <Darius> Add a constructor to THSyntax, add some to/fro conversions in DsMeta and Convert.lhs and hope there aren't any subtle issues.
07:55:50 <o3> Darius: thanks.  i'll be brave tomorrow :)
07:56:56 <phubuh> hee hee, I just read the bruce perens article that states that buying a license from SCO violates the GPL
09:33:54 <andersca> hej shapr
09:34:17 <shapr> hej andersca
09:34:21 <shapr> hur är det med dig?

09:35:16 <andersca> jag behÃ¶ver kaffe
09:35:21 <shapr> har du kodat för mycket?
09:36:21 <andersca> nej :/
09:36:27 <andersca> fÃ¶r lite
09:36:29 <shapr> heh
09:36:35 <shapr> jag också
09:39:10 * Darius will one day just understand this stuff from to much #haskell.
09:39:40 * shapr grins
09:41:46 * Darius goes to look at byte code stuff in the GHC sources.
12:46:19 * shapr boings
12:46:26 <shapr> so, anything nifty happening today?
12:53:38 <shapr> guess not.
13:00:02 <shapr> hi galority

13:37:28 <andersca> he's upgrading his kernel
13:37:38 <isomer> uh oh
13:37:43 <isomer> from what to what?
13:38:26 <andersca> I dunno
