00:24:18 * Pseudonym woohoos
00:24:28 <Pseudonym> O(n^3) primality tester
00:24:39 <Pseudonym> Assuming the AKS conjecture is true, anyway. :-)
00:31:42 <norpan> what is n? the number or the logarithm of the number?
00:33:39 <Pseudonym> The logarithm of the number.
00:34:07 <Pseudonym> That's what makes it so impressive.
00:34:48 <norpan> well, the algorithm based on probability is still very much faster
00:34:57 <norpan> i suppose
00:34:59 <Pseudonym> Yes, it is.
00:35:05 <Pseudonym> But it depends what you want.
00:35:09 <norpan> of course
00:35:25 <Pseudonym> If you want crypto-strong pseudo-primes, the Fermat is your man.
00:35:41 <norpan> he is? :)
00:35:47 <Pseudonym> If you want hash table sizes, you can do even better.
00:36:57 <Pseudonym> But if you actually want prime numbers, I suspect you won't be able to do much better than this.
00:42:41 <Pseudonym> Must go home.
00:42:42 <Pseudonym> Nytol.
01:09:26 * shapr bounces
01:15:21 * andersca boings
01:15:37 <andersca> shapr: your HaWM idea is interesting...
01:16:00 <shapr> question is, where do we find docs on how to write a WM without buying the X book?
01:17:26 <shapr> Reid wrote X bindings
01:18:53 <andersca> I don't think I need the X book
01:19:08 <shapr> hej sandos 
01:19:13 <sandos> hej
01:19:29 <shapr> are you learning Haskell? or looking for other users?
01:19:38 <sandos> learning
01:19:44 <sandos> course at uni ;)
01:22:14 <shapr> have you seen the Learning Haskell page?
01:22:22 <sandos> yeah
01:22:49 <sandos> reading yet another haskell tutorial
01:22:58 <shapr> yah, I like that one.
01:44:28 <shapr> sandos: have any questions?
01:49:31 * shapr deplores the cheesiness of procedural code
01:51:01 <shapr> lambdabot: be quiet or I will replace you with a very small combinator!
01:51:01 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"

01:53:58 <shapr> no, but I would assume it would work, as long as you don't mind waiting some weeks for it to clear
01:54:10 <shapr> I'm used to doing international money transfers, those are faster
01:54:50 <andersca> I got a check that I need to cash

04:31:52 <phubuh_> hi there
06:13:59 <phubuh_> map (\(n, s) -> show n ++ " " ++ s)
06:14:05 <phubuh_> can I write that points-free somehow?
06:16:21 <kosmikus> yes, but it does not get nicer
06:16:49 <phubuh_> i see
06:16:58 <kosmikus> why do you want to do it?
06:17:26 <phubuh_> i have this long chain of points-free compositions, and one ugly lambda smack in the middle of it :-)
06:17:49 <kosmikus> define
06:18:01 <kosmikus> cross :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> (a,c) -> (b,d)
06:18:08 <kosmikus> (the map function on pairs)
06:18:17 <kosmikus> I don't understand why that's not in the prelude
06:18:47 <kosmikus> then you can say something such as
06:18:57 <kosmikus> cross (id,(" "++))
06:19:06 <kosmikus> to get the space in front of the "s"
06:19:16 <phubuh_> ah, nice
06:19:24 <kosmikus> finally, you can use the uncurried version of (++) to catenate the two elements of the pair
06:20:25 <earthy> how does (id,(" "++)) match type (a -> b)  ?
06:20:34 <kosmikus> sorry
06:20:46 <kosmikus> cross id (" "++)
06:20:52 <earthy> ah, 'kay.
06:21:16 <kosmikus> I sometimes define cross as its uncurried self -- looks more symmetric
06:22:39 * earthy nods
06:23:22 <kosmikus> although with the uncurried version you can write (id `cross` (" "++)) -- or you could even define it as an operator, but *, **, and *** are already in use
06:30:07 <phubuh_> ncat = unlines . map (uncurry (++) . cross show (" " ++)) . zip [1..] . lines
06:30:07 <phubuh_> main = getArgs >>= readFile . head >>= putStr . ncat
06:30:09 <phubuh_> :-)
06:34:10 <kosmikus> :)
06:34:50 <phubuh_> is there a prelude function \x -> \y -> (x, y)?
06:35:57 <Lunar^> "(,)" I think
06:36:12 <phubuh_> how obvious :-)
06:36:18 <Lunar^> Prelude> :t (,)
06:36:19 <Lunar^> (,) :: forall b a. a -> b -> (a, b)
06:36:25 <harsha123> hello #haskell

06:36:29 <lambdabot> No match for ",".
06:36:32 <phubuh_> @prelude (,)
06:36:34 <lambdabot> No match for "(,)".
06:36:45 <harsha123> hi shapr
06:36:46 <Lunar^> I think this is a builtin
06:36:46 <phubuh_> hrmpf.
06:36:51 <phubuh_> ah
06:37:47 <harsha123> shapr: hi
07:00:35 <kosmikus> @type (,)
07:00:35 <lambdabot> (,) :: a -> b -> (a,b)
07:02:18 <phubuh_> kosmikus, ah, cool
07:11:23 <phubuh_> <znutar> wow, emacs is about the same size as the space shuttle's flight avionics software
07:46:07 <Igloo> Has LISP had eval since the very beginning?
07:46:41 <phubuh_> yes, i believe it has.
07:50:21 <Igloo> Ta
07:54:55 <shapr> yeehaa
07:56:08 <shapr> @type (,)
07:56:08 <lambdabot> (,) :: a -> b -> (a,b)

07:56:38 <shapr> ivory tower?
07:56:47 <Igloo> shapr: Checking its type hadn't changed in the last 56 mins?  :-)
07:57:31 <Igloo> Is that a well-known phrase?
07:57:56 <phubuh_> academics? :-)
07:58:54 <Igloo> Oh, that might work! Especially if I can think of a more PC term than weirdo for "academics and weirdos"  :-)
08:00:12 * Igloo goes with academics and oddballs

08:00:42 <Igloo> Thanks guys
08:01:27 <phubuh_> agh, I'm trying to write a points-free cross
08:03:59 <kosmikus> I don't think you can
08:04:21 <phubuh_> I figured :-(
08:09:09 <phubuh_> this program reads a file and prints every line with a line number:
08:09:12 <phubuh_> cross f g (x, y) = (f x, g y)
08:09:12 <phubuh_> ncat = unlines . map (uncurry (++) . cross show (" " ++)) . zip [1..] . lines
08:09:12 <phubuh_> main = getArgs >>= readFile . head >>= putStr . ncat
08:09:34 <phubuh_> but when i add ". take 2" to the end, it only grabs one character from the second line
08:10:06 <phubuh_> why is this?
08:19:18 <kosmikus> where do you add take 2 ?
08:19:31 <kosmikus> at the end of ncat?
08:21:25 <phubuh_> yes
08:21:37 <phubuh_> ooh, haha
08:21:48 <phubuh_> this isn't a list of lines, this is a list of characters :-)

08:59:55 <shapr> hi bluey 
09:02:01 <shapr> bluey: looking for Haskell programmers?
09:03:45 <shapr> hey Arnia 
09:03:47 <shapr> @arr
09:03:48 <lambdabot> Aye
09:14:30 <Arnia> Hey shapr
09:14:42 <shapr> wassup?
09:15:08 <Arnia> I'm good, how are you?
09:16:56 <shapr> I'm doing well
09:17:00 <shapr> we got a new Plone client today!
09:17:24 <Arnia> Yay! :)
09:17:28 <shapr> even better, we walked into the meeting room and the board was filled with Haskell code
09:17:37 <Arnia> Woah
09:18:40 <shapr> hei benja_ 
09:18:51 <benja_> hei
09:19:02 <shapr> Arnia: so I was immediately driven into action upon seeing bunches of monadic code on the whiteboard
09:19:02 <ibid> hi :)
09:19:25 <shapr> after which I had to make notes around the edges about monad transformers and arrows, including URLs and references to papers.
09:19:50 <shapr> so the people giving the meeting, that is, the clients we were pitching the website to, they decided we had a clue.
09:20:19 <Arnia> shapr: Always good to be able to impress like that :)
09:20:28 <shapr> heh, it was just a lucky accident :-)
09:20:55 <ibid> did the clients understand any of it?
09:21:14 <shapr> well, the head client guy used to work for Ericsson, so we chatted about Erlang some.
09:21:25 <shapr> and he told me about EriPascal, which I hadn't known about
09:21:36 <ibid> ah :)
09:21:36 <shapr> he said it integrated features of Ada into Pascal, including exceptions and other useful stuff.
09:22:11 <shapr> I explained some of the similarities and differences of Erlang and Haskell, but I got the glazed look
09:22:35 <shapr> and the other guy, the client geek, he did some ML, so we talked about that some.
09:23:15 <shapr> anyways, we got the contract
09:24:25 <Arnia> :)
09:24:25 <benja_> ibid: re exercise timing: I suppose it's quite possible that I get Thompson wrong and he wants less verbosity. I didn't find any specific instructions, but then again, I only skimmed the parts between the exercises... ;-)
09:24:57 <ibid> :)
09:25:22 <ibid> benja_: i often say, use "mathematician's precision" :) ie. leave unimportant stuff out
09:25:44 <benja_> ok, I'll take that to heart in the future :-) -- there's lots of that there...
09:26:51 <ibid> the important thing is that i can follow the reasoning and that the point of the exercise is fulfilled :)
09:27:05 <ibid> (the point, obviously, varies from exercise to exercise)
09:29:06 <ibid> benja_: btw, i'm using a "minimum feedback" strategy; i put your exercise score into korppi and don't usually comment further. i do answer specific questions, thouhj
09:29:09 <ibid> though
09:29:28 <benja_> ok
09:29:32 <ibid> (a necessity due to limited resources)
09:30:50 <ibid> do you take finnish classes, btw?
09:30:58 <benja_> ibid: hm, where in Korppi would I find that?
09:31:12 <ibid> go to the course page?
09:31:15 <benja_> finnish classes: no, that has to wait until I'm a full student and don't have to pay for them =)
09:31:18 <benja_> yes?
09:31:42 <ibid> do you find a link that says "demoaktiivisuus"?
09:31:44 <ibid> (i don't see the student's version of it)
09:32:01 <benja_> that's a heading on that page...
09:32:07 <benja_> ok, so demo1 is my score in first week
09:32:10 <ibid> yes
09:32:18 <benja_> and dmax1 the maximum possible?
09:32:22 <ibid> yes
09:32:28 <benja_> ok
09:33:10 <ibid> the demo-% is calculated as sum(demo*)/sum(dmax*)*100, and demopisteet is that divided by 5
09:33:37 <ibid> (the demopisteet is the final exercise points you would receive if we stopped the course here)
09:34:36 <ibid> i usually add the dmax (it's a global constant) in the beginning of the week, and your deadline is at the end, so you'll have a lower score than really most of the time
09:34:47 <ibid> than what you deserve, i mean
09:35:00 <benja_> y
09:35:05 <shapr> hi pep
09:35:16 <pep> hi
09:35:18 <shapr> what did the pl guys say Haskell was good for?
09:35:25 <pep> well
09:35:36 <pep> they said it is good for programming :)
09:35:37 <shapr> heh
09:35:39 <shapr> good answer!
09:35:49 <pep> :)
09:36:05 <pep> are there a real, working, large programs written in haskell?
09:36:09 <pep> I mean
09:36:14 <pep> sth like HTTP server
09:36:14 <shapr> sure
09:36:14 <ibid> pep: the haskell compilers?:)
09:36:21 <shapr> yes, there's a web server too
09:36:24 <phubuh_> there is a HTTP server, in fact
09:36:34 <ibid> a http server is hardly large :)
09:36:42 <pep> haskell compilers are written in haskell?
09:36:45 <ibid> yes
09:36:46 <benja_> ibid: I remember that you told me at HT'01 that using a language to implement itself isn't the most impressive thing to outsiders ;-)
09:36:49 <pep> hm
09:37:04 <phubuh_> ghc is, for example.
09:37:04 <ibid> benja_: true :) but it is the true test of the language
09:37:04 <pep> is haskell descendant of Life programming language?
09:37:12 <phubuh_> as in conway's?
09:37:30 <shapr> I thought Conway's life was just about cellular automata?
09:37:32 * pep had one lecture about Life on his studies
09:37:38 <phubuh_> it is nevertheless turing complete
09:37:41 <pep> hm
09:37:48 <shapr> Haskell is a descendant of lambda calculus, mostly
09:37:51 <shapr> phubuh: really?
09:37:53 <pep> afaik Life is Prolog with functional extensions
09:37:55 <phubuh_> really!
09:37:57 <shapr> wow
09:37:59 <shapr> I didn't know that.
09:38:23 <ibid> there is a list of parent languages in the report, i believe
09:38:28 <pep> no, not artificial life algorithms
09:38:33 <shapr> I do vaguely recall that von Neumann started out with a huge critter that could reproduce itself, requiring eight states per square and several sheets of graph paper
09:38:48 <pep> heh
09:38:56 <shapr> anyways,
09:39:11 <shapr> Haskell is like lisp taken to an extreme
09:39:13 <shapr> or maybe farther
09:39:13 <ibid> "Although it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of many ideas, the following languages were particularly influential: Lisp (and its modern-day incarnations Common Lisp and Scheme); Landin's ISWIM; APL; Backus's FP [1]; ML and Standard ML; Hope and Hope+; Clean; Id; Gofer; Sisal; and Turner's series of languages culminating in Miranda (Miranda is a trademark of Research Software Ltd.). Without these forerunners Haskell would not have been possible."
09:39:21 <pep> hm
09:39:25 <ibid> (the haskell revised report)
09:39:52 <shapr> > map (\x -> x + 1) [1,2,3]
09:39:52 <shapr> [2,3,4]
09:40:05 <pep> okay, I don't know any of these languages :)
09:40:16 <pep> shapr: lambda function
09:40:34 <shapr> > filter (\x -> x > 5) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
09:40:34 <shapr> [6]
09:40:53 <pep> I thought Haskell is more like programming in logic
09:40:56 <pep> I mean
09:40:57 <ibid> pep: i recommend getting at least acquainted with scheme and sml
09:41:11 <ibid> pep: haskell is programming in functions
09:41:14 <shapr> pep: the bigger steps become fun
09:41:15 * pep has programmed a little in scheme
09:41:30 <ibid> oh, then you know at least one of the listed languges :)
09:41:46 <pep> heh
09:41:50 <pep> only the basics :)
09:42:17 <SyntaxPolice> hm. I wonder if someone has been spreading a rumer that you don't have to program if you use haskell :)
09:42:22 <benja_> ibid: I've never actually gotten to the point of using Haskell for anything interesting -- it's always been stuck at the this-neat-function-for-that-limited-domain thing
09:42:31 <ibid> benja_: :)
09:42:39 <ibid> benja_: my master's thesis used haskell
09:42:46 <ibid> as the implementation language
09:43:02 <benja_> (which is related to the fact that I basically only used it in classes)
09:43:07 <shapr> benja_: write a lambdabot plugin!
09:43:09 <benja_> ibid: I should know, I read it ;-)
09:43:18 <benja_> shapr: hmm?
09:43:19 <ibid> you did?:
09:43:21 <ibid> :)
09:43:25 <shapr> benja_: you could write a lambdabot plugin
09:43:32 <shapr> @listmodules
09:43:32 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]
09:43:40 <benja_> (well, skimmed and read some parts, truth to be told. but yes, I did)
09:43:55 <pep> are you guys the lecturers of computer languages at some university?
09:43:57 <ibid> are you interested in my spring course, btw?
09:43:59 <benja_> shapr: documentation on that? :)
09:44:04 <ibid> pep: some of us are
09:44:07 <shapr> benja_: ask me anything ;-)
09:44:23 <shapr> pep: I'm just a self-employed programmer.
09:44:24 <benja_> can you give me an idea for a module to write? :)
09:44:33 <shapr> well, @uptime would be a simple one
09:44:36 <benja_> pep: I'm taking ibid's course
09:44:52 <pep> benja_: aha
09:45:13 <benja_> shapr: so it should print the time that lambdabot has been up?
09:45:20 <shapr> sure
09:45:24 <benja_> is the code for lambdabot somewhere?
09:45:27 <shapr> yup
09:45:40 <shapr> the latest code is in the darcs repo http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs
09:45:44 <ibid> benja_: make it sufficiently interesting and that's your course project :)
09:45:52 <shapr> the nearly as recent code is in the cvs tree of haskell-libs.sf.net
09:46:01 <ibid> could be, if you want, that is
09:46:01 <pep> I used to write real, working programme in Python, which has some functional extensions
09:46:05 <pep> hm
09:46:10 <shapr> pep: yes, I jumped from Python to Haskell myself
09:46:26 <benja_> I prefer Python syntax for things over Haskell's generally :-)
09:46:26 <shapr> significant whitespace, higher order functions, it's like functional training wheels :-)
09:46:29 <ibid> i don't remember why i got interested in haskell originally
09:46:40 <shapr> benja_: like what?
09:46:43 <ibid> benja_: python's layout rule is broken :)
09:46:44 <benja_> i.e., list comprehension and reduce()
09:46:51 <shapr> list comprehensions came from Haskell
09:47:00 <pep> methinks Python is easier, but this may be only due to me being used to imperative languages
09:47:04 <benja_> -- rather than foldr, foldl, fold1 (did I get those right)
09:47:08 <phubuh_> i love the syntax for list comprehensions in haskell
09:47:23 <benja_> shapr: I know, Python has the benefit of learning from haskell in its syntax ;-)
09:47:32 <pep> list processing was always the strong point in func. langs
09:47:34 <shapr> next you'll have do notation in Python ;-)
09:47:36 <ibid> but i remember telling a fellow student that in haskell, the program only asks the questions it needs to without extra effort from the compiler :)
09:47:38 <pep> afaik
09:47:42 <ibid> boy i was naive then :)
09:48:00 <shapr> ibid: lazy evaluation gives you some of that...
09:48:09 <ibid> (i also said, shame that there are no free implementations, so i must do my own)
09:48:13 <shapr> heh
09:48:14 <ibid> (like i could've...)
09:48:18 <benja_> (well, I like important things to look a little like english, to be more understandable, so I prefer [x for i in list if i > 12] -- and also because it ties in nicely with the 'for' and 'if' commands of course)
09:48:23 <ibid> shapr: not in that sense
09:48:27 <pep> what is the CVS access point to scannedinavian.org archive?
09:48:31 <shapr> well, hbc was hacked up by one person in not much time, right?
09:48:35 <ibid> shapr: IO is essentially eager 
09:48:44 <ibid> shapr: with much more knowledge, i presume :)
09:48:44 <phubuh_> scannedinavian uses darcs, not cvs, i think
09:48:52 <shapr> pep: it's not CVS, it's darcs.. http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/
09:49:19 <pep> hm
09:49:28 <pep> seems that there is no darcs package in debian 3.0
09:49:29 <shapr> darcs is a revision control system (like CVS) written in Haskell.
09:49:35 <ibid> though i have been playing with the idea of having a look-under-the-hood haskell evaluator
09:49:40 <pep> :D
09:49:58 <shapr> pep: you can either wait till the real debs reach unstable
09:50:06 <shapr> or in the meantime you can add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list
09:50:12 <shapr> deb http://http.abridgegame.org/debian/ unstable/
09:50:12 <shapr> deb-src http://http.abridgegame.org/debian/ unstable/
09:50:35 <pep> shapr: I'll try to get the sources and recompile for stable
09:50:40 <ibid> my latest programming project is a personal blog system written in haskell
09:50:40 <shapr> ok
09:50:44 <shapr> ibid: have you seen wiwiwi?
09:50:48 <shapr> it's half wiki half blog
09:50:56 <ibid> shapr: no
09:51:05 <shapr> Lunar^: do you have the latest sources? I'm missing something from wiwiwi
09:51:21 <shapr> ibid: http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/wiwiwi/blog.cgi?action=view&name=Home
09:51:28 <benja_> I got into Haskell because the people at the university used it, and had a good laugh when reading in the "short introduction" on the homepage that the following should be understandable without understanding *either* haskell or quicksort first:
09:51:29 <benja_> qsort []     = []
09:51:29 <benja_> qsort (x:xs) = qsort elts_lt_x ++ [x] ++ qsort elts_greq_x
09:51:29 <benja_>                  where
09:51:29 <benja_>                    elts_lt_x   = [y | y <- xs, y < x]
09:51:31 <benja_>                    elts_greq_x = [y | y <- xs, y >= x]
09:51:35 <shapr> I wish I could get the capitalization to stick in the url bar
09:51:36 <phubuh_> haha
09:51:40 <ibid> shapr: one of my requirements is that it serves only static pages :)
09:51:58 <shapr> hm
09:52:38 <shapr> pep: there are directions for building darcs on woody on this page: http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/
09:52:52 <shapr> ibid: I dunno then, I guess you could generate the pages and upload them.
09:52:55 <shapr> wiwiwi is pretty basic
09:53:01 <pep> shapr: shapr: there are woody packages too
09:53:05 <shapr> ah, ok
09:53:10 <shapr> I use debian/unstable
09:53:18 <ibid> shapr: part of the fun is to do it yourself :)
09:53:23 <shapr> truly
09:53:25 <ibid> myself, that is
09:53:36 <shapr> I wrote a bayesian spam filter in Haskell for that reason.
09:53:59 <ibid> i already have a working blog system, it's just that i have a wishlist of features, and i might just as well have some fun :)
09:54:09 <shapr> well, I'm looking forward to it then
09:54:18 <ibid> don't hold your breath :)
09:54:20 <benja_> shapr: so you export your module's definition through defining 'theModule'?
09:54:22 <shapr> heh
09:54:30 <Lunar^> shapr: No I don't
09:54:34 <Lunar^> shapr: sebc still is in Italia
09:54:37 <shapr> benja_: that's actually for the Dynamic Reloading stuff
09:54:48 <shapr> Lunar^: when's he coming back? I want hOp and wiwiwi!
09:55:04 <shapr> not bad enough to actually hack on them myself mind you :-)
09:55:28 <Lunar^> shapr: He also will have to find a new place to live in Edinburgh first !
09:55:42 <shapr> benja_: lambdabot has GHCi functionality, so modules can be rebuilt and reloaded while it's running.
09:56:32 <benja_> hm... so how would I go about writing a hello world module? (i.e., you say @hi, lambdabot says, "Hello, World!")
09:56:35 <Lunar^> shapr: I need to build PDF programaticaly.. heard of anything that would let me use Haskell ?
09:56:39 <Lunar^> @hi
09:56:40 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "hi", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
09:56:42 <Lunar^> @hello
09:56:43 <lambdabot> Hello world. 
09:56:47 <Lunar^> :)
09:56:48 <benja_> ha :)
09:56:58 <shapr> @listcommands hello
09:56:58 <lambdabot> Module hello provides the following commands: ["hello","goodbye"]
09:57:09 <pep> cool
09:57:11 <benja_> probablly defined in HelloModule...
09:57:16 <shapr> could be ;-)
09:57:20 <pep> you can talk and program at the same time :)
09:57:35 <benja_> @goodbye
09:57:36 <shapr> Lunar^: I think so... lemme check
09:57:37 <lambdabot> Hello world. 
09:57:45 <pep> I mean, at the same channel
09:57:51 <shapr> pep: huh?
09:58:17 <shapr> oh, you mean we can be social while we're writing code?
09:58:28 <pep> shapr: nope
09:58:45 <pep> shapr: you can write the programs using irc channel as text editor
09:58:51 <benja_> shapr: what's the ``rest`` in ``process`` for?
09:58:52 <shapr> oh, sort of
09:59:09 <pep> shapr: must be very productive
09:59:13 <shapr> @echo foobar

09:59:27 * pep has studied software engineering
09:59:35 <Lunar^> shapr: I could use Haskell to generate XSL-FO then convert it into PDF

10:08:49 <shapr> ok
10:08:59 <phubuh_> i'm interested in it, though
10:09:06 <shapr> yah, it's a fun toy.

10:13:04 <phubuh_> benja_, the read function is overloaded for Int and Integer; read str::Int or read str::Integer
10:13:49 <benja_> can I convert "124" to 124 with it?
10:14:00 <phubuh_> Prelude> read "124"::Int
10:14:00 <phubuh_> 124
10:14:00 <phubuh_> :)
10:14:05 <benja_> ok
10:14:34 <pep> shapr?
10:14:43 <shapr> what?
10:14:46 <shapr> oh
10:14:51 <shapr> pep: it's lojban
10:15:11 <shapr> pep: check out http://www.lojban.org/
10:15:49 <phubuh_> xu indicates a yes/no question, tavla means "speak", do means "you"
10:15:53 <phubuh_> (right?)
10:15:56 <shapr> right
10:16:23 <shapr> fo means 'fourth place' and 'la lojban' means 'that which I call lojban'
10:16:35 <phubuh_> fo in this context means "in the language", essentially -- all in all, it's "do you speak lojban"?
10:16:54 <phubuh_> except with the question mark inside of the quotation
10:18:05 <phubuh_> i want to write something in haskell, but i don't have anything i need to have written. i'm unpragmatical like that. :(
10:18:12 <shapr> I sort of wonder if it would be better to break lojban down into simpler combinators, one for each position in a 'verb'
10:18:22 <shapr> phubuh: write a lambdabot plugin!
10:19:01 <phubuh_> yes, that'd be fun
10:19:31 <shapr> for example, one that calls jbofihe
10:21:28 <benja_> I bet you don't have "Mikä tämä on, Barbar?" books in Lojban, though ;-)
10:22:00 <shapr> minulla en ole idee
10:22:08 <shapr> or something like that
10:25:03 <shapr> hi xiaoniu 
10:25:15 <benja_> phubuh_: hm, and the other way? int to string?
10:25:47 <phubuh_> benja_, show converts values of type Show to String
10:26:31 <shapr> re pep 
10:26:44 <benja_> right
10:26:58 <pep> hi, I had problems with connection :)
10:27:02 <xiaoniu> hi..
10:27:08 <xiaoniu> shapr....hmm
10:27:10 <pep> okay, got darcs installed, what do I do now?
10:27:23 <pep> to get lambdabot for example?
10:27:29 <xiaoniu> shapr maybe i am a yellow or orange..
10:27:49 <shapr> pep: move to the dir you wish to have bunches of Haskell sources in, run darcs get --verbose http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs
10:27:49 <xiaoniu> shapr i am referring to the martial arts style colored belt grading system
10:27:54 <shapr> xiaoniu: oh, nifty
10:28:14 <xiaoniu> anyway..
10:28:14 <xiaoniu> i didnt expect to see so many people here
10:28:20 <xiaoniu> got some questions to ask though..
10:28:41 <shapr> many here are part of the Haskell Secret Underground, but they're very quiet about it.
10:28:54 <shapr> xiaoniu: ask away
10:29:18 <pep> Haskell Secret Underground?
10:29:31 <shapr> oh wait, the HSU doesn't exist ;-)
10:29:38 <benja_> shapr: I have my first demo module ready, can I test it? :)
10:29:44 <pep> :)
10:29:58 <shapr> benja_: sure, change BotConfig.hs to give your 'bot a different name, and run him
10:30:34 <benja_> should I check out the files though CVS or something or should I download them all with HTTP?
10:30:45 <shapr> benja_: if you're using darcs, send me your public GPG key (or fingerprint) and I'll give you write privs on the repo
10:31:16 <shapr> I'd suggest "darcs get --verbose http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs" in the dir where you want the sources

10:33:54 <pep> shapr: real == official?
10:33:58 <shapr> pep: yes
10:34:55 <shapr> xiaoniu: what questions do you have?
10:35:20 <benja_> what do I do to get it to run? in which places do I need to add my module? :)
10:35:37 <shapr> xiaoniu: I assume that you've looked at the HaWiki enough to read the HomeworkHelp page...

10:45:16 <xiaoxiaoniu> i am doing some type checking
10:45:23 <xiaoxiaoniu> okie i am sorry
10:45:29 <shapr> well, first time :-)
10:45:31 <xiaoxiaoniu> well it is like this 
10:45:44 <xiaoxiaoniu> how can i check if Appn Expn Expn?
10:46:02 <xiaoxiaoniu> coz say a function = ("g",[([Arg "f",Arg "x"],Simple (Tuple []))])
10:46:17 <xiaoxiaoniu> it is g f x = () in string
10:46:39 <xiaoxiaoniu> how can i group g f as appn then g f x again later
10:46:51 <shapr> benja_: I deleted Fact from DYNMODS, added FactModule.hs to EXCLUDES, emptied HTOOLKIT = and commented out the FactModule.o rule
10:46:58 <shapr> maybe I should just check in an updated Makefile
10:47:06 <shapr> since it's such a pain to build HSQL
10:47:20 <xiaoxiaoniu> and i really have no idea how can i group the LHS from the RHS
10:47:41 <benja_> probably...
10:47:43 <xiaoxiaoniu> i have built up a function to convert from expn to type though
10:48:21 <shapr> benja_: http://scannedinavian.org/~shae/Makefile
10:48:35 <shapr> try that for the moment
10:48:41 <benja_> ok
10:48:53 <phubuh_> shapr, do you know how to spawn a process and get its stdout handle?
10:48:53 <shapr> benja_: are you using the darcs repo?
10:49:09 <shapr> phubuh: not off the top of my head, but I think @type does that with Hugs
10:49:14 <benja_> ok, it gets to the errors in my program ;-)
10:49:17 <benja_> shapr: yup
10:49:32 <shapr> ok
10:50:34 <phubuh_> shapr, what do you mean? how can @type do that?
10:51:37 <shapr> phubuh: look at TypeModule.lhs, it's written in the creative fiction style...
10:52:18 <shapr> ah, it uses popen
10:52:19 <phubuh_> oh, you mean that @type
10:52:32 <pep> heh, "creative fiction" :)
10:52:38 <phubuh_> haha
10:53:55 <pep> hey, is Brainfuck.hs a bran*ck interpreter?
10:54:01 <shapr> pep: yup
10:54:54 <pep> have you got Malbolge interpreter too? :>
10:55:03 <shapr> xiaoxiaoniu: I don't immediately know the answer to your question, and I don't have the spare cycles to stare at it for awhile. It does look interesting though, since I'm idly working on a simple interpreter myself
10:55:10 <phubuh_> does lambdabot use hugs?
10:55:15 <shapr> nope, lambdabot uses ghc
10:55:18 <phubuh_> okay
10:55:22 <shapr> but @type calls hugs via popen
10:55:27 <phubuh_> ah
10:55:31 <shapr> pep: no, want to write one? :-)
10:55:48 <xiaoxiaoniu> okie.
10:56:11 <xiaoxiaoniu> shapr if u are interested email me again.
10:56:17 <shapr> xiaoxiaoniu: sure, what's your email?
10:56:27 <xiaoxiaoniu> at opabc@rocketmail.com
10:56:39 <phubuh_> is popen included with ghc?
10:56:39 <shapr> xiaoxiaoniu: you may be able to find something useful in lambdabot's EvalModule, it's a lambda calculus interpreter with many additions
10:56:45 <shapr> written by Darius 
10:56:48 <shapr> phubuh: I think so
10:57:02 <xiaoxiaoniu> okie where do i get the file
10:57:35 <shapr> xiaoxiaoniu: either the cvs tree of haskell-libs.sf.net, or the darcs repo at http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs for the most recent code
10:58:01 <xiaoxiaoniu> shapr okie ..thanks.
10:58:31 <shapr> we're moving to darcs in an attempt to see if it's production ready, and to support Haskell software.
11:00:45 <benja_> shapr: ok, it compiles... now how do I start it? :)
11:00:49 <pep> heh, "note the handy error catching, now with 15% less crashes!"
11:01:02 <pep> in FactModule.hs :)
11:01:23 <shapr> benja_: ./lambdabot
11:01:26 <benja_> ok
11:01:38 <benja_> benja@joy:~/study/lambdabot/hlibs/lambdabot$ ./lambdabot

11:01:38 <benja_> Action: openFile
11:01:38 <benja_> Reason: No such file or directory
11:01:38 <benja_> File: /package.conf
11:01:44 <shapr> pep: yah, I finally discovered the postgres error handler 
11:01:54 <shapr> hm
11:02:22 <shapr> FactModule was the first real lambdabot plugin after HelloWorld
11:03:15 <shapr> oh, that looks like SystemModuleNaming.hs
11:03:16 <shapr> hmm
11:03:33 <shapr> oy
11:04:07 <benja_> ?
11:04:19 <shapr> benja_: oh, you need to change ghcLibraryPath in GHCLibraryPath.hs to point to your package.conf
11:04:34 <shapr> I assume that would be "/usr/lib/ghc-6.0/" ?
11:04:45 <shapr> I'm using ghc-cvs, so mine's different
11:04:52 <benja_> it's not
11:05:00 <benja_> but this is debian, wouldn't it be in share? ...
11:05:08 <benja_> ...no
11:05:17 <pep> hm, hm, I have ghc-5.02-2
11:05:22 <benja_> blah
11:05:27 <pep> it doesn't find StaticModules
11:05:28 <shapr> it's named "/usr/lib/ghc-6" ++ something
11:05:29 <benja_>  /usr/lib/ghc-6.0.1/
11:05:31 <benja_> ;-)
11:05:33 <shapr> ok
11:05:49 <shapr> pep: I'd recommend installing ghc6

11:06:48 <pep> okay, I ive up
11:06:53 <pep> give up :>
11:06:56 <shapr> pep: which debian are you using?
11:07:05 <shapr> benja_: er, I know that error...
11:07:06 * shapr thinks
11:07:09 <pep> shapr: woody
11:07:27 <pep> shapr: I'll look at apt-get.org
11:07:35 <shapr> benja_: have you edited BotConfig.hs to change the name of lambdabot to something else?
11:07:47 <shapr> I should add alternate nickname to the TODO list
11:08:03 <benja_> shapr: yup
11:08:07 * shapr thinks
11:08:26 <shapr> benja_: have you set Verbose to True in BotConfig?
11:08:46 <benja_> getVerbose is false
11:08:57 <shapr> it probably won't fix it, but it may show you the error
11:09:16 <benja_> nope
11:09:20 * shapr blinks
11:09:25 <benja_> benja@joy:~/study/lambdabot/hlibs/lambdabot$ ./lambdabot

11:09:38 <shapr> hm
11:10:08 * shapr wonders
11:11:25 <benja_> I think I'll be going to bed... but we can continue this another time. :-)
11:11:28 <shapr> ok
11:11:29 <benja_> cu!
11:11:31 <shapr> cya
11:11:56 <shapr> dang, I've forgotten why I got that error before.
11:12:10 <shapr> or how I fixed it.
11:12:42 <shapr> that sucks
11:13:45 <shapr> hej norpan 
11:14:10 <phubuh_> hmm.
11:14:14 <phubuh_>     Failed to load interface for `Posix':
11:14:14 <phubuh_>         Could not find interface file for `Posix'
11:14:30 <shapr> phubuh: -package posix?
11:14:38 <phubuh_> aha!
11:14:47 <phubuh_> ah, thanks :-)
11:16:22 <phubuh_> hmm, is there a fst that works on triples?
11:17:41 <shapr> I don't know of anything
11:17:56 <phubuh_> oh well, it's trivial to define.
11:19:45 <phubuh_> hmm.
11:19:49 <shapr> ?
11:21:37 <phubuh_> never mind
11:22:42 * pep thinks lambdabot makes perfect candidate for his home channel 
11:23:25 <shapr> yes, if only you can get it to build :-)
11:24:02 * pep will make lambdabot suitable for ghc5
11:24:25 <pep> that shouldn't be very hard to do, should it?
11:24:25 <shapr> I think it's pretty close to ghc5 suitability, or was very recently
11:24:32 <shapr> no, it shouldn't be too hard
11:24:56 <pep> the only thing I need is StaticModules
11:25:05 <shapr> ?
11:25:28 <shapr> StaticModules.hs is generated from StaticModules.conf
11:26:14 <pep> hm
11:26:19 <shapr> I think :-)
11:26:31 <phubuh_> shapr, my Module.process needs to use the IO monad
11:26:44 <phubuh_> eh, I'll just look at the other modules :-)
11:26:59 <phubuh_> ah
11:27:02 <shapr> phubuh: should be no problem, just liftIO to the IRC monad
11:27:06 <phubuh_> yeah :)
11:32:58 <pep> hm, where I can find network package?
11:33:37 <phubuh_> do i need a lot of stuff to compile lambdabot? :/
11:33:58 <Lunar^> A recent ghc
11:34:05 <Lunar^> And removing FactModule
11:34:11 <phubuh_> i see
11:34:26 <shapr> Lunar^: http://web.archive.org/web/20010224003414/http://www.numeric-quest.com/funpdf/
11:34:46 <Lunar^> shapr: May I kiss you ?
11:35:00 <shapr> heh, not right now ;-)
11:35:11 <phubuh_> oh wow, darcs is in gentoo
11:35:29 <pep> shapr: do You like Hugs? ;)
11:35:31 <Lunar^> PDFlib is a third party product, freely available for non-commercial usage. <-- eek
11:35:38 <shapr> pep: not really, but it has its good points.
11:36:09 <shapr> I prefer GHC because I get binaries then.
11:36:14 <phubuh_> I was surprised to see that the output that popen returns was of String... and then it hit me. god, I love lazy evaluation.
11:36:16 <Tomasso> how would you implement the function dividesTo x y  (returns True if x divides y) recursively???
11:36:22 <shapr> Hugs is nice if you want to use Haskell on a Sharp Zaurus...
11:37:08 <Tomasso> to show that x divides y, there must exist z in wich x * z = y
11:37:08 <phubuh_> Tomasso, subtract y from x repeatedly. when y < x, if y = 0 they divide, if it is not, they do not
11:37:15 <pep> shapr: well, isn't zaurus too slow to have haskell interpreter installed in it?
11:37:17 <mgoetze> shapr: but i can't afford a sharp zaurus
11:37:49 <phubuh_> err, i got y and x confused there
11:37:49 <shapr> mgoetze: nor can I
11:37:53 <Tomasso> phubuh_!! i see... hmhmhm
11:37:58 <Tomasso> interesting let me check
11:38:10 <shapr> pep: I don't know, I've heard it's possible, but I never asked how speedy
11:38:18 <pep> shapr: I got Python interpreter on my iPAQ, but it doesn't seem to be usable to do usual stuff
11:38:31 <shapr> I have python on my Palm IIIc, it's slow
11:38:44 <phubuh_> how do I use darcs to grab lambdabot?
11:38:45 <pep> shapr: yep, and consumes much memory
11:38:56 <shapr> I know there's a Haskell runtime for PalmOS, but it hasn't been released yet
11:39:11 <shapr> phubuh_: darcs get --verbose http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs
11:39:27 <phubuh_> okay, cool
11:39:29 <shapr> and if you send me your public GPG key or fingerprint, I'll add to the list of people with write privs
11:39:35 <phubuh_> wow, that was fast
11:39:47 <shapr> well, it's on a 10Mb line
11:39:52 <pep> shapr: I heard Ericcsson cellular phones are programmed in erlang
11:39:58 <shapr> pep: if so, I'm impressed.
11:40:03 <phubuh_> well, still. i bet with cvs it would've taken ten seconds :-)
11:40:23 <pep> well, I haven't ever seen a single line of erlang code
11:40:27 <shapr> Erlang still does some things better than Haskell
11:40:40 <shapr> but Haskell does many other things better than Erlang in my opinion :-)
11:40:54 <shapr> Lunar^: looks like it's become pdflib.com
11:41:14 <phubuh_> do I need to get HToolkit from elsewhere?
11:41:27 * pep doesn't know which lang is better, but he believes shapr is right :)
11:41:52 <shapr> pep: it depends on what you need to do, Erlang is better for some things
11:42:07 <shapr> though I hope Haskell catches up
11:42:23 <shapr> phubuh_: HToolkit comes from htoolkit.sf.net, but it's a real pain to build and install
11:42:28 <phubuh_> :/
11:42:39 <shapr> I'd recommend you use the hacked Makefile : http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/~shae/Makefile
11:42:54 <phubuh_> oh :-)
11:42:55 <shapr> I'll commit the changes to hlibs sometime soon
11:42:59 <phubuh_> seems to build now
11:43:01 <shapr> yya
11:43:05 <shapr> yay
11:43:05 <shapr> ahem
11:43:35 <phubuh_> yay!
11:43:44 <shapr> now the real question, does it run?
11:44:05 <phubuh_> that's what I was yaying for!
11:44:18 <phubuh_> how, how do I make it use my module? :)
11:44:38 <shapr> well, you could add it the list of statically loaded modules
11:45:03 <phubuh_> where's that?
11:45:07 <shapr> or you could make it dynamically loaded
11:45:16 <shapr> you put the first part of the name into StaticModules.conf
11:45:33 <phubuh_> ah
11:45:51 <shapr> dynloading is fun because then you can change your module and reload it without restarting lambdabot 
11:45:57 <phubuh_> ooh!
11:45:58 <shapr> @listcommands dummy
11:45:59 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy"]
11:46:53 <shapr> @dummy
11:46:53 <lambdabot> dummy
11:46:59 <shapr> @listcommands dynamic
11:47:00 <lambdabot> Module dynamic provides the following commands: ["dynamic-load","dynamic-unload","dynamic-reload"]
11:47:06 <shapr> @dynamic-reload dummy
11:47:06 <lambdabot> module reloaded
11:47:09 <shapr> @listcommands dummy
11:47:10 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy","foo"]
11:47:12 <shapr> @foo
11:47:12 <lambdabot> bar
11:47:45 <shapr> look in BotConfig.hs at getModuleFile
11:49:25 <pep> @bar
11:49:25 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "bar", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
11:49:33 <pep> eh...
11:49:36 <shapr> @foo
11:49:36 <lambdabot> bar
11:49:50 <shapr> the foo command just send a message saying "bar"
11:50:03 <shapr> but you can change that if you want
11:50:39 <pep> hm, maybe I will extend it to "bar" -> "pep"
11:50:43 <shapr> :-)
11:50:47 <phubuh_> yay!
11:50:50 <pep> :>
11:50:52 <phubuh_> <phubuh_> @cmafihe klama
11:50:52 <phubuh_> <phulambda> klama <BRIVLA> [come] 
11:50:56 <shapr> w00!
11:51:37 <shapr> phubuh: ok, if you send me your GPG key or fingerprint, you'll be able to do darcs push --verbose --sign
11:52:02 <phubuh_> I'll have to make one
11:52:07 <shapr> ok
11:52:12 <phubuh_> <phubuh_> @cmafihe
11:52:12 <phubuh_> <phulambda> Nothing is universal.
11:52:15 <phubuh_> i like that pun :-)
11:52:29 <shapr> :-)
11:53:00 <phubuh_> gpg --gen-key?
11:53:23 <shapr> I haven't done it in so long I'd have to read the instructions, but I think that's right.
11:53:28 <phubuh_> hehe, okay
11:54:32 <phubuh_> hmm, okay. what do I give you? :)
11:54:49 <shapr> the public part of the key
11:55:08 <shapr> the fingerprint is enough if you have uploaded your public key to the keyservers
11:55:22 <phubuh_> that sounds like a good idea.
11:55:56 <phubuh_> what's the address of the keyserver?
11:56:09 <pep> shapr: what is the difference between key fingerprint and key number?
11:56:27 <shapr> there are several, the first one comes to mind is wwwkeys.pgp.net
11:56:53 <shapr> pep: the key is about half a page of ascii, the fingerprint is the first few digits, and has always been unique in my experience
11:57:23 <pep> www.keyserver.com
11:57:25 <shapr> the fingerprint is just a hopefully unique way to identify the full thing
11:57:37 <phubuh_> $ gpg --keyserver "http://wwwkeys.pgp.net" --send-keys phubuh
11:58:26 <phubuh_> so, the output of 'gpg --fingerpring phubuh' is what you want, yes?
11:58:37 <phubuh_> (sorry, I'm very inexperienced with this stuff)
11:58:38 <shapr> assuming I can get the rest from the keyserver, yes
11:58:48 <shapr> took me awhile to figure out also
11:59:00 <shapr> I did some minor crypto stuff at my last job, so I had a chance to learn
11:59:38 <phubuh_> I sent it to you in privmsg :)
11:59:40 * pep has his key stored just in case
12:02:07 <pep> hm
12:02:27 <pep> afaik to be secure, you should dictate the fingerprint via telephone :>
12:03:24 <esap> telephone is unsafe.
12:04:25 <pep> the fingerprint is not secret data, they should authorize their voices
12:05:24 <pep> so that shapr knows what phubuh voice sounds like, and vice versa, that's like key signing works
12:05:31 <pep> afaik
12:05:55 <shapr> in this case, the trust is based on an IRC relationship, and the priveleges are being able to make changes to hlibs repo
12:06:10 <pep> right
12:06:11 <shapr> actually signing a key requires in-person ID
12:06:25 <pep> yep
12:06:26 <shapr> speaking of which, I need to do that for Heffalump and Marvin--
12:06:40 <pep> heh :)
12:06:53 <shapr> I met them at ICFP
12:07:13 <pep> International Conference of Free Programming?
12:07:25 <shapr> s/Free/Functional
12:07:38 <shapr> I got to meet Simon Peyton-Jones and a bunch of other people too
12:07:40 <pep> almost guessed :)
12:07:57 <pep> dunno anyone of these, sorry :)
12:08:00 <pep> are they famous?
12:08:06 <shapr> in some places, yah
12:08:26 <shapr> SPJ is the main Haskell guy in my opinion.
12:08:42 <shapr> admittedly, he's one of many.
12:09:20 * Arnia worships SPJ at an altar of monads
12:09:25 * pep would like to have his key signed by Dijkstra :)
12:09:31 <pep> Arnia :)
12:09:55 <shapr> hi Arnia 
12:10:01 <shapr> wassup?
12:10:26 <Tomasso> hmmh can anyone tell me how do i keep a value in a recursive function?
12:10:37 <Arnia> Not much... trying to get the will to work on my dissertation.
12:10:37 <phubuh_> Tomasso, keep it on the stack as an argument
12:10:55 <Tomasso> the stack generated by the recursion?
12:11:05 <shapr> phubuh: hm, gpg is unhappy about getting the key from the keyserver... can you try gpg --export phubuh > phubuh.key and send me the .key file?
12:11:07 <phubuh_> yes
12:11:12 <shapr> Tomasso: call yourself with the value?
12:11:13 <phubuh_> shapr, sure thing
12:11:33 <Tomasso> hhm but if the argument has to be used in other elements of the stack?
12:11:54 <shapr> save it in a structure you carry around?
12:12:00 <phubuh_> shapr, I tried to send it with DCC
12:12:14 <shapr> phubuh: oh, this client doesn't have DCC, do you have sendfile installed?
12:12:34 <phubuh_> compiling :-)
12:12:57 <phubuh_> okay
12:13:34 <Tomasso> hmhm
12:13:56 <Tomasso> shapr: what you mean for save it in a structure you carry around?
12:17:22 <phubuh_> factorial n = aux n n
12:17:22 <phubuh_>     where aux a 0 = n
12:17:22 <phubuh_> 	  aux a n = aux (a * n) (n - 1)
12:17:37 <phubuh_> hmm, the indentation got screwed up in the paste.
12:22:38 <shapr> phubuh: thanks for your contribution to the Haskell Collective.
12:22:58 <phubuh_> thanks for giving me something to do :-)
12:23:26 <shapr> we can play with the GPG key stuff more later, and you'll be able to keep your own Haskell sources in the hlibs code-wiki
12:23:35 <phubuh_> yay
12:30:22 <shapr> @quit
12:30:23 <Tomasso> for example to write a recursive function that decides weather a number is prime or not, i need a variable to hold the number
12:30:30 <Tomasso> how do i do that?
12:30:43 <Arnia> @arr
12:30:43 <lambdabot> Is that a hornpipe in yer pocket, or arr ya just happy ta see me?
12:31:19 <phubuh_> Tomasso, make a helper function that takes another argument, in which you hold the number
12:31:23 <phubuh_> look at my factorial example
12:32:07 <shapr> @cmafihe cilre
12:32:07 <lambdabot> cilre <BRIVLA> [learn] 
12:32:08 <shapr> yay
12:32:10 <phubuh_> yay!
12:32:36 <shapr> in the meantime, your module is online :-)
12:35:08 <Tomasso> phubuh_ do global variables exist?
12:35:33 <Tomasso> in place to write a function that the only thing it does is to hold a value
12:35:53 <Tomasso> isnt it dirty to do that?
12:36:01 <phubuh_> they exist (guess what most functions are?), but they're not mutable
12:36:28 <Tomasso> you mean, f = 4
12:36:34 <Tomasso> without parameters?
12:36:38 <phubuh_> yes
12:37:00 <Tomasso> hooo hehe then a variable is a function with no parameters
12:37:16 <Tomasso> everything in unix is a function HAHAHAHHAHA
12:37:24 <Smerdyakov> I don't consider that to be a function.
12:37:30 <Arnia> bbl
12:37:38 <Tomasso> it does not have domain
12:38:09 <Tomasso> for the value empty it assigns always the same value
12:38:17 <Tomasso> Smerdyakov: why do you say that?
12:38:38 <Smerdyakov> Tomasso, because a function has a type with ->, and that need not.
12:39:02 <Tomasso> f = 4 is f::Int
12:40:51 <Tomasso> phubuh_ but the problem of doing that is that i have to modify the definition file every time i want to call the function for a diferent value
12:41:01 <Lunar^> shapr: I'm going to make new bindings for PDFLib
12:44:13 <shapr> yay
13:15:56 <ship> can anyone tell me how do i return a function?
13:17:49 <pep> @foo
13:17:50 <lambdabot> bar
13:18:02 <ibid> ship: you don't
13:18:05 <phubuh_> ship, an anonymous function, you mean?
13:18:17 <ibid> ahh, return a function, not _from_ a function
13:18:19 <ibid> you return it
13:18:28 * pep sees wonderful future ahead of haskell developers
13:18:30 <phubuh_> ship, foo x = \z -> x * z
13:18:45 <ibid> foo x z = x * z :)
13:18:52 <phubuh_> well, yeah
13:19:21 <pep> does it work: x, y = x * y, x + y ?
13:19:46 <phubuh_> yes, i don't see why it wouldn't
13:20:12 <pep> phubuh_: I was guessing, dunno haskell syntax
13:20:14 <ibid> that's a pattern binding, ought to work, though i'd add some parentheses for style :)
13:20:48 <vegai> does it even work without?
13:20:49 <phubuh_> if you actually try to print one of x or y, it'll loop endlessly, though
13:21:28 <vegai> ghci does endless loops in one second on my box
13:21:33 <phubuh_> ;o
13:21:38 <vegai> *** Exception: <<loop>>
13:21:40 <vegai> ;)
13:21:50 <vegai> it was actually much faster, but I rounded up
13:21:55 <pep> so after this instruction is completed, x == x * y == (x * y) * y and such?
13:21:56 <phubuh_> whoa, looks like they finally solved the halting problem!
13:22:12 <vegai> well...
13:22:23 <phubuh_> pep, well, yes... but you'll never be able to get those results.
13:22:40 <pep> because of infinite recursion
13:22:44 <phubuh_> yeah.
13:22:46 <ibid> ghc uses blackholing to detect those, i believe
13:23:02 <pep> dunno what blackholing is
13:23:45 <ibid> thunks that are being evaluated are replaced with a black hole
13:24:16 * vegai thought up an _awful_ pun about that.
13:24:21 <ibid> and if they are referred to before the black hole is replaced with the real value, ghc runtime gives that error message
13:24:28 <ibid> i think
13:24:31 <ibid> vegai: please tell :)
13:24:48 <pep> ibid: so it is like a deadlock detection in databases?
13:24:54 <vegai> it was so horrid, I forgot it almost completely. Something about ghci sucking 
13:24:58 <ibid> pep: probably
13:25:20 <pep> another issue: is monad simply a package or is it something more?
13:25:23 <vegai> I meant awful as in stale
13:25:49 <ibid> pep: monad is an abstract data type that satisfies some equations
13:25:59 <ibid> certain equations that is, the monad laws
13:26:32 <pep> ibid: is monad comparable to monitor?
13:26:34 <phubuh_> monads are primarily for keeping state
13:26:48 <phubuh_> consider the task of making a random number generator
13:26:49 <pep> ibid: or object?
13:27:03 <phubuh_> you'd probably have a kind of seed, for example an Integer
13:27:15 <pep> yes
13:27:28 <ibid> pep: there are no objects (in OO sense) in haskell
13:27:35 <phubuh_> and every time you made a new random number, you'd change the seed
13:27:52 <phubuh_> but since we can't change values, we'll just return the new seed
13:27:57 <ibid> pep: monads form a well-behaving imperative sublanguage within haskell
13:28:07 <phubuh_> random :: Seed -> (Integer, Seed)
13:28:25 <phubuh_> so to get two random values, we'd do
13:28:34 <ship> im here
13:28:50 <phubuh_> let firstRandom, firstSeed = random 123
13:28:56 <phubuh_> (pretend 123 is the time, or something)
13:29:02 <ship> has anyone seen those high order functions?
13:29:05 <phubuh_> let secondRandom, secondSeed = random firstSeed
13:29:23 <ibid> ship: which those?
13:29:26 <pep> ibid: so haskell is imperative within monads and functional at the higher level of abstraction?
13:29:48 <phubuh_> do you understand how this can mostly replace mutable variables?
13:29:59 <ship> a function is high order if it receives a function as parameter or returns a function as parameter
13:29:59 <ibid> pep: haskell is functional, even during monads, but monads allow you to write imperative programs even as you are doing it functionally :)
13:30:17 <ibid> ship: i know. which "those" HOF's did you mean?
13:30:49 <pep> ibid: okay, it looks like lawyer's speech :)
13:31:57 <phubuh_> pep, are you with me? :)
13:32:15 <pep> phubuh_: dunno, what do you think?
13:32:26 <ibid> pep: let me rephrase it. monads are purely functional; but the style that they are used is the same as the familiar imperative style
13:33:08 <ibid> pep: most importantly, you have easy idioms for sequencing actions and for doing (fake) destructive updates
13:33:20 <ibid> (fake in that they are not really destructive updates, except that they are:)
13:34:14 <pep> ibid: does haskell have such thing as "variable history" implemented in the language?
13:34:28 <pep> ibid: I mean, something like in databases
13:34:58 <ibid> pep: i don't know databases much. what is "variable history"?
13:35:27 <pep> ibid: some DBMS'es maintain the history of values assigned to the database field, in case the transaction failed
13:36:12 <ibid> pep: variables are unique; you cannot destroy their values (you create new ones instead, or use anonymous variables)
13:36:24 <pep> ibid: okay, I get it
13:36:26 <ibid> pep: all purely functional data structures are persistent by default
13:36:44 <ibid> (persistent in that old versions are kept unless they become garbage)
13:36:56 <pep> ibid: that's the thing I didn't learn from my functional languages lectures
13:37:23 <ibid> pep: look into okasaki's work on functional data structures, you may find it interesting
13:39:19 <ibid> pep: monads change that equation a little, since they enforce single-threadedness (in that old versions of data are not accessible, not in the concurrency sense), but that applies only to mutable variables provided by monads
13:39:41 <pep> ibid: well, the more interesting aspect of a language for me would be the acceleration that programming language (or any other tool) gives the implementer in his work
13:40:38 <pep> ibid: I am looking for Master Thesis subject, look at http://fanthom.irc.pl/~pdemb for a reason :)
13:40:39 <ibid> (monads fake mutable variables in a way that is semantically just a special case of purely functional variables, but implementations see them as normal mutable variables - i think)
13:42:10 <ibid> pep: hmm, related to haskell?
13:42:30 <pep> ibid: maybe, open source software engineering is too difficult for me
13:42:57 <vegai> it's probably more accurate that programming languages always decelerate the speed of implemention
13:42:58 <ibid> pep: any subject? or related to free software SE?
13:43:00 <vegai> some just not so much
13:43:04 <ibid> vegai: :)
13:43:34 <pep> ibid: related to software engineering
13:43:39 <ibid> all programming languages suck. haskell just sucks less - michael elkins, paraphrased
13:43:44 <pep> heh
13:44:35 <pep> my Professor used to teach programming languages theory but he recently switched to software engineering 
13:44:50 <vegai> dark side won ;/
13:44:54 <phubuh_> :~(
13:44:55 <pep> heh
13:44:55 * ibid is officially a SE guy but really is a theoretical CS guy
13:45:22 <pep> ibid: so what are you working on now?
13:45:41 <ibid> pep: right now? teaching fp :)
13:45:56 <ibid> my research is in formal methods, though
13:46:05 <pep> ibid: VDM?
13:46:07 <pep> ibid: Z?
13:46:08 <ibid> B
13:46:15 <pep> ibid: dunno B
13:46:21 <pep> what is it?
13:46:31 <ibid> read my master's thesis:)
13:46:35 <pep> heh
13:46:50 <pep> could you give me a clue what is it about?
13:47:54 <ibid> the thesis?
13:48:01 <pep> B
13:48:14 <ibid> http://www.mit.jyu.fi/antkaij/pubs.html :)
13:48:19 <pep> uh...
13:48:21 <pep> okay
13:48:38 <ibid> B is a formal method, developed by the originator of Z
13:48:59 <pep> ah, the same boring crap
13:49:08 <pep> I slept on these lectures :)
13:49:12 <ibid> whereas Z is just a specification notation, B is a full tool-supported process-supporting method
13:49:19 <esap> seems very complicated :-)
13:49:19 <ibid> :)
13:49:27 <ibid> not really, - well, depends
13:49:33 <pep> nah, formal methods are piece of cake :>
13:49:45 <pep> they are just so...
13:49:47 <pep> formal
13:50:10 <esap> no, I meant I just looked at the AST, and it was like the whole world was being described :-)
13:50:41 <pep> esap: just like in XFree compilation (make world) :))
13:50:57 <vegai> well, the thesis _is_ 154 pages
13:52:27 <vegai> from conclusion: "...As such, this thesis feels like a torso..." ;)
13:53:29 <pep> hm
13:53:40 <pep> boring crap
13:53:48 * pep yawns
13:53:58 <pep> :)
13:54:26 <pep> will it make any breakthrough in software engineering?
13:54:30 <pep> I mean
13:54:35 <pep> will anybody use it?
13:54:36 <ibid> pep: there is no silver bullet
13:54:46 <pep> ibid: I know, there is only beer :>
13:54:48 <vegai> pep: no need for past tense
13:55:02 <ibid> there are a lot of people already using formal methods in general, and B in specific
13:55:13 <pep> ibid: where, for example?
13:55:39 <pep> I know VDM is used in some corporation
13:55:55 <ibid> a recently built Paris metro line is controlled by B-developed software
13:55:57 <pep> but I don't remember where
13:56:05 <pep> heh
13:56:09 <ibid> that's the killer product :)
13:56:25 <pep> you mean the same thing like the Chrysler project is for XP?
13:56:31 <ibid> it's huge, and its safety/reliability requirements are scary
13:56:37 <ibid> pep: dunno
13:56:49 <ibid> pep: don't know "the Chrysler project -- for XP"
13:56:56 * pep 's prof. concentrates on adaptive methodologies
13:57:24 <pep> the first commercial project, where "XP" name was meant
13:57:38 <pep> you know, eXtreme Programming
13:57:45 <ibid> yeah
13:57:49 * pep doesn't like XP
13:57:56 <ibid> i just first associated it with windows :)
13:57:58 * pep prefers OSSE
13:58:02 <pep> heh
13:58:07 <pep> ibid: everyone does :)
13:58:18 <ibid> and i don't know what the Chrysler project
13:58:20 <pep> ibid: but eXtreme Programming was first than WindXP
13:58:28 <ibid> pep: i do know that
13:58:43 <ibid> OSSE is not in the same dimension as XP
13:58:48 <ibid> you can't compare them
13:58:50 <ibid> usefully
13:58:53 <pep> ibid: hm, the project where XP provided it is usable
13:59:17 * pep thinks OSSE is compatible with XP on some level of abstraction
13:59:20 <ibid> "it"?
13:59:34 <pep> ibid: "it" == eXtreme Programming
13:59:42 <ibid> XP provided XP?
13:59:42 <pep> ibid: aren't you too formal right now?
13:59:56 <pep> ibid: XP provided it is usable
14:00:09 <ibid> ah XP, provided it is usable :)
14:00:14 <pep> ibid: jesus, you formal languages guys are weird...
14:00:18 <ibid> commas help sometimes :)
14:00:20 <pep> heh :)
14:00:30 <ibid> pep: that has nothing to do with formal languages :)
14:00:31 <pep> yep, indeed, esp. in programming
14:00:41 <pep> okay, my english suxx
14:00:46 <ibid> pep: it's just that ambiguous parses are common in natural language
14:00:59 <pep> ibid: may be
14:01:31 <vegai> and perl
14:01:31 <ibid> also ambiguous environments (in the PL sense:)
14:01:33 * vegai hides.
14:01:43 <pep> ibid: PL sense?
14:01:50 <pep> ibid: ah, programming langs
14:02:01 <ibid> yeah
14:02:41 <vegai> my saying nothing useful seems to indicate an increased level of fatigue
14:03:13 * ibid should really go to bed, i have nothing for to...days (it's 3 mins past midnight here:) lecture
14:03:22 <ibid> (except a general idea what i want to discuss
14:03:25 <vegai> I wish I'll get some time to reread those Hofstadter books sometime
14:03:34 <Binkley> mmm...Hofstadter...
14:03:43 <vegai> I bet they'll be a whole different experience now
14:03:54 <Binkley> I find something new every time I re-read GEB
14:04:15 <ibid> i got bored with GEB about halfway through... he explains stuff wrong, btw
14:04:17 <ibid> some stuff
14:04:32 <vegai> have you touched "Metamagical Themas"?
14:04:35 <ibid> no
14:04:46 <phubuh_> what does he explain wrongly?
14:04:49 * esap read GEB long time ago, then loaned the book to someone who didn't return it :-(
14:04:58 <ibid> :)
14:05:20 <Binkley> Metamagical Themas is good too. Somewhat random.
14:05:26 <ibid> phubuh_: i don't remember the specifics, but his explanation of the significance of gödel's theorem is off
14:05:35 <esap> The best part of GEB was the djinni.
14:05:42 <pep> ibid: here it is 1 hour earlier
14:05:58 <vegai> perhaps he simplifies for the sake of audience
14:06:08 <phubuh_> esap, hmm, the one with an endless amount of carriers, or what was it?
14:06:20 <ibid> he makes it more confused than it is
14:06:21 <vegai> I mean, I wasn't completely stumped by it the first time I read it
14:06:27 <vegai> and that was _before_ high school math
14:06:42 <phubuh_> i read it when i was 14, and i didn't have any trouble with it
14:07:00 <esap> phubuh: the one where he discussed "I wish I hadn't wished that".
14:07:09 <phubuh_> ah, right!
14:07:17 <ibid> it had something to do with the classification of formulae to provable etc; it was missing an important part, one which is often missed by people who explain logic
14:07:38 <phubuh_> still, it seemed like a very pleasant introduction
14:07:42 <ibid> the general idea of self-reference is cool, though, and some of his stuff about it is nice
14:08:22 <vegai> ibid: what part is missing about the classifications?
14:09:14 <ibid> vegai: the idea of models is often forgotten, and thus also contingencies, which are an important part of what gödel actually said
14:09:48 <ibid> i spent months during my msc work just to clarify these issues for myself
14:10:07 <pep> okay
14:10:14 <vegai> ok, that can be harmful certainly
14:10:16 <pep> goin' to sleep
14:10:18 <esap> ibid: can you explain these contingencies with a few words?
14:10:19 <pep> seeya :)
14:10:48 <ibid> esap: contingent formulae are formulae that hold in some but not all models
14:11:02 <esap> ibid: oh, that :-)
14:11:17 * esap didn't know the word.
14:11:32 <vegai> wikipedia.org is good for that stuff, I've learned
14:11:46 * ibid writes for wikipedia! :)
14:12:22 * esap likes wikipedia as well.
14:12:24 <vegai> seems to be down now, though ;P
14:12:33 <ibid> when you focus too much upon proof, all you see are tautologies and contradictions.  contingencies are often forgotten
14:13:03 <ibid> and that is a real source of trouble if you try to understand gödel or church-turing...
14:13:15 <ibid> (i mean the entscheidungsproblem)
14:14:06 * esap doesn't have that problem. I usually forget both the tautologies and the contradictions :-)
14:14:43 <ibid> remember that provable formulae are precisely tautologies, and disprovable formulae are contradictions
14:14:56 <Lunar^> Does anyone know how exactly things should be done when importing a C function and giving it an Haskell callback pointer ?
14:15:02 <ibid> when you think that those are all there is, gödel sounds very esoteric
14:15:56 <ibid> but when you remember that there are also contingent formulae, gödel becomes simple: all interesting theories have contingent formulae (or alternatively, nonstandard models)
14:16:09 <ibid> s/disprovable/refutable/, actually
14:17:25 <ibid> (or am i again mixing the terms. i do that all the time...)
14:18:00 * ibid goes check
14:19:29 <ibid> yes, the s/// was wrong
14:26:18 <jdahlin> Is there a function similar to tail in haskell, but that can handle empty lists?
14:26:23 * esap has thought a bit how interpreters and type hierarchies interact. No conclusions yet :-)
14:26:42 <Binkley> What result do you think such a function should return for the empty list?
14:26:51 <jdahlin> an empty list
14:27:02 <Binkley> Not that I know of, but you can write one
14:27:10 <Darius> Lunar^: I'd have to look at the spec, but it didn't seem too difficult
14:27:26 <jdahlin> okay, I just thought one existed
14:27:29 <Darius> jdahlin: Maybe [a] would be better
14:28:20 <Darius> safeTail [] = Nothing;safeTail (_:xs) = Just xs
14:28:48 * esap would use arbitrary monads instead of Maybe.
14:28:56 <Igloo> drop 1 xs
14:29:03 <Darius> yes, NotJustMaybe
14:30:59 <Binkley> oh, nice
14:31:34 <Darius> applying NotJustMaybe to safeTail would give us both what we wanted.
14:32:24 <Lunar^> Darius: I think I found what I need
14:32:26 <ibid> NotJustMaybe?
14:32:35 <Lunar^> Darius: foreign export dynamic & freeHaskellFunPtr
14:32:51 <esap> oh btw, there is a drawback to NotJustMaybe: sometimes the extra generality bites (and you cannot any more use 'show' without a type annotation)
14:35:03 <esap> In ghci, I often have to specify type annotations just due to that kind of generality.
14:35:15 <ibid> what's NotJustMaybe?
14:35:24 <esap> http://haskell.org/hawiki/NotJustMaybe
14:35:31 <Darius> see the wiki
14:36:01 <ibid> yeah, i like that :)
14:36:30 <ibid> i rewrote my inference engine to be monadic. it was better that way, but it was a pity :)
14:36:36 <Darius> Lunar^: You are trying to import a C function that takes a Haskell function as an argument?
14:37:06 <esap> It's even worse for my Adjunction type class. You almost never have the specific type when working with it.
14:38:25 <ibid> monads have the nasty habit of permeating code
14:39:52 * esap has an example at: http://www.kotiposti.net/epulkkin/Adjunction.txt
14:41:58 <esap> ibid: monads should permeate code. That's why they work.
14:43:17 <ibid> esap: monads force an imperative style
14:43:41 <Darius> Lunar^:  It looks like you should import the C code as normal that takes a FunPtr, and use foreign import "wrapper" to make Haskell functions into FunPtr's.
14:43:57 <esap> ibid: yes. That's because monads express sequentiality [and imperative programming is based on it]
14:44:09 <ibid> esap: exactly
14:44:23 <ibid> esap: that's why i'd rather not use monads where i don't have to
14:44:43 <esap> ibid: but I'd actually expect that comonads would express parallelism [just dualise monads]
14:46:26 * esap has the feeling I've talked about this a lot lately though :-)
14:46:34 <ibid> esap: if i wanted to program imperatively, i would use an imperative language :)
14:47:04 <esap> ibid: But Haskell is a good imperative language.
14:47:27 <Darius> A syntax for commutative monads would help.  Not thinking too deeply about it, some annotation on arguments seems like it would do it.
14:47:43 <ibid> esap: i've heard that before, but i can't really agree with it
14:47:55 <jdahlin> I get this error message from hugs: Ambiguous variable occurrence "someFunction"
14:48:14 <jdahlin> I can't figure out why, I just call a function recursivly
14:49:05 <Binkley> Can you show your code?
14:49:16 <jdahlin> takeWhile          :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
14:49:16 <jdahlin> takeWhile f []      = []
14:49:16 <jdahlin> takeWhile f (x:xs) 
14:49:16 <jdahlin>   | f x == False    = xs
14:49:16 <jdahlin>   | otherwise       = x : takeWhile f xs
14:49:32 <ibid> jdahlin: rename your function
14:49:53 <jdahlin> ibid: oh, thanks
14:50:58 <ibid> (or hide the prelude takewhile:)
14:51:00 <Darius> Using syntax that would give the parser fits, some Reader monad code might look like, foo `(bar x) (3+`ask) which would translate into do a <- bar x;b <- ask;foo a (3+b)
14:54:35 <Darius> nested backticks would be unpacked in applicative order foo `(bar `ask) ==> do a <- ask;b <- bar a;foo b
14:56:07 <Smerdyakov> Let's call the backticks "periwinkles" instead.
15:14:05 <esap> Hmm... do you agree that 'const' and 'flip seq' are cbn and cbv versions of the same thing?
15:15:05 <Darius> you mean the other way: const for cbv flip seq for cbn?
15:15:14 <Darius> nm
15:15:28 <Darius> I misunderstood what you were asking for
15:16:00 <esap> no, I think const is cbn, in a sense.
15:16:31 <esap> I just realized they might be related
15:16:47 <Darius> I thought you meant if cbv 'const' is the same as cbn 'flip seq'
15:17:57 <esap> heh, no, I think cbv const would be the same as 'flip seq' if I'm right.
15:18:13 <shapr> @arr
15:18:13 <lambdabot> Is that a hornpipe in yer pocket, or arr ya just happy ta see me?
15:19:52 <Darius> esap: but yes, it should be. Why wouldn't it?
15:20:39 <esap> darius: well, I don't know, it should, I guess.
15:21:03 <shapr> oy vey
15:21:33 <esap> darius: seq is defined as a primitive, but const is built from quite much smaller pieces. Maybe you can split seq also to those parts?
15:23:36 * esap is splitting primitives into parts :-)
15:24:08 <earthy> whee!
15:24:09 <earthy> I=lambda x: x
15:24:09 <earthy> K=lambda x: lambda y,x=x: x
15:24:09 <earthy> S=lambda x: lambda y,x=x: lambda z,x=x,y=y: x (z) (y (z))
15:24:09 <earthy> print S(K)(K)(3)
15:24:22 <earthy> how to use python as a lambda-calculus evaluator. :)
15:24:43 <Darius> @eval S K K 3
15:24:43 <lambdabot> 3
15:25:02 <earthy> darius: yeah, but that's in haskell... :)
15:25:07 <jdahlin> lambdabot understans python?
15:25:10 <jdahlin> understands
15:25:19 <Darius> how to use a lambda calculus evaluator as a lambda calculus evaluator.
15:26:18 <Darius> esap: I don't see how you can split seq up.  One could add strictness annotations to type a la Clean though, which would make seq definable.
15:26:20 <earthy> @eval (\x.x)(\x.\y.\z.(x z)(y z))(\x.\y.x)(\x.\y.x)(\x.x)
15:26:21 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
15:26:26 <earthy> ghe. ;)
15:26:44 <earthy> @eval (\x.x)(\x.\y.\z.(x z)(y z))(\x.\y.x)(\x.\y.x)3
15:26:45 <lambdabot> 3
15:27:02 <earthy> 'kay. bedtime. g'maen y'all.
15:27:08 <esap> darius: well since cbn and cbv are duals, you have to dualize flip const, and you should get seq.
15:27:47 <Xcalibor> hi all
15:27:51 <Binkley> @eval (\x.x x)(\x.x x)
15:27:51 <esap> darius: now flip = \f x y -> f y x and const x _ = x. Now have to just find duals for these, and you're done.
15:28:02 <lambdabot> out of fuel - use @resume to continue
15:28:06 <Binkley> hehe
15:28:09 <Darius> you could use const id
15:29:05 <esap> oh const id is the same as flip const? hmm..
15:29:36 <Xcalibor> @arr
15:29:36 <lambdabot> Arrr!
15:29:40 <shapr> @arr
15:29:40 <lambdabot> Aye
15:30:00 <shapr> obviously my magic numbers need help, the andersca quote never shows up
15:30:29 <Xcalibor> shapr: is the lambdabot code available for review and learning?
15:30:32 <shapr> sure
15:30:34 <andersca> hehe
15:30:48 <shapr> darcs get --verbose http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hlibs
15:31:23 <esap> const = \x _ -> x. I guess dual of that is control x. control y. x  and the dual of id is id, so seq = [id](control x. control y. x)  [hmm.. I hope I didn't make a mistake there]
15:31:27 <shapr> Xcalibor: you can get darcs from http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/ or from your local binary or source package
15:31:34 <shapr> hi jao 
15:31:43 <jao> hey shapr
15:31:51 <Xcalibor> what's darcs? where lambdabot comes from?
15:32:07 <Xcalibor> ah, i see...
15:32:08 <shapr> no, darcs is a source control system written in Haskell
15:32:45 <Xcalibor> interesting...
15:32:58 <Xcalibor> downloading it now
15:33:17 <esap> darius: no actually, dual of id is _|_. hmm...
15:33:49 <esap> darius: ack, it's something like _|_, but not quite.
15:34:03 <shapr> Xcalibor: do you use Linux?
15:34:13 <Xcalibor> sure I do
15:34:49 <Xcalibor> very hacked up mandrake 9.1
15:35:02 <shapr> I dunno if there are mandrake rpms of darcs
15:35:14 <Xcalibor> no problem, i do like tarballs :-)
15:35:39 * esap cannot dualize the identity function :-(
15:35:58 <shapr> could it be its own dual?
15:36:17 <esap> shapr: it could, but I don't think so. id : (x:type) -> x -> x.
15:37:14 <esap> shapr: the dual of x -> x is C\\C, where C is some constant.
15:37:29 <esap> shapr: which is the same as _|_-type.
15:42:13 <esap> oh, but id = f . g, if f -| g, so dual(id) = dual(g) . dual(f). Hmm. That might be easy to calculate.
15:45:42 <jewel> hey guys
15:47:21 <jewel> damn, I missed IFCP 2003
15:47:23 <Xcalibor> mmm... darcs is asking for readline and whatnot...
15:47:49 * esap thinks I need to get some sleep... [2am already]
15:51:00 <shapr> hi jewel 
15:55:14 <jewel> hey shapr
15:55:25 <jewel> I see it was won by a C++ coder!
15:55:49 <Xcalibor> well... gotta go to bed... laters!
15:57:58 <Binkley> hearing John Hughes say that C++ was the programming tool of choice for discriminating hackers was a sad, sad thing
15:59:02 <yazirian> hehehe
15:59:42 * yazirian kinda thought the problem was bogus this year.
16:02:45 <Binkley> yeah, it was too hard
16:03:18 <yazirian> well that and it could be brute-forced
16:03:22 <yazirian> (and was)
16:03:24 <Binkley> true
16:04:33 <mattam> it was too brute-force compliant yeah, and actually some people have lots of computers at their disposal (i think the winner got 17 P4 right?)
16:04:47 <yazirian> yeah
16:04:57 <yazirian> maybe they were xeons
16:04:59 <yazirian> but still
16:06:34 <yazirian> I think the problem would've been well-suited to a conference on NUMERIC computation, sure.
16:08:19 <mattam> I talked with a friend about it, and he said there was probably a formal solution but i'm not an expert on such things
16:08:48 <mattam> given that you have formulas for all the arithmetic operations...
16:12:40 <Lunar^> Yahoo :)
16:13:04 <Binkley> the arithmetic operations aren't the hard part
16:13:04 <Lunar^> http://lune.talath.net/~lunar/pdflibtest.pdf
16:13:16 <Binkley> you just translated what they gave you into code. it's just typing.
16:13:34 <Binkley> the hard part is finding the optimal path
16:13:53 <shapr> Lunar^: cool
16:14:13 <Lunar^> I don't think that I'm going to do the whole binding
16:14:17 <Lunar^> This is a very complex lib
16:14:23 <mattam> Binkley: i meant for giving a formal solution
16:14:32 <shapr> Lunar^: put it into hlibs, others will work on it.
16:14:38 <shapr> I could use PDF output via Haskell myself
16:14:41 <shapr> though not just now
16:14:46 <Binkley> a formal solution for what?
16:14:46 <Lunar^> But I might go to make it really nice using a monad
16:14:50 <mattam> using physics or graph theory, i don't know
16:15:30 <Lunar^> shapr: Ok, I'm sending this version right now
16:15:30 <Lunar^> shapr: Just the time to add licensing and stuff
16:16:06 <mattam> an optimal solution if you prefer, not a search or approximation using a rough path and some speed/steering optimizations
16:17:35 <shapr> Lunar^: cool
16:29:05 <Lunar^> ledit darcs !
16:31:10 <Lunar^> I just "darcs pushed"
16:32:34 <Lunar^> shapr: PDFLib thread an abstract pointer through every call to it
16:32:54 <Lunar^> shapr: I really need think that a Monad will do well here
16:35:11 <shapr> I don't see the push on the list of patches
16:35:16 <shapr> anyways, I'm off to sleep
16:35:42 <Lunar^> shapr: same here.. we'll see that tomorrow
17:08:04 * steveh unidles
17:08:11 <steveh> so many languages and APIs
17:08:13 <steveh> so little time
17:11:10 <jdrake> yes there are
17:11:20 <jdrake> choose well
17:11:44 <jdrake> chose the wrong one, and you won't want to take a drink out of it
17:13:59 <steveh> lol
17:14:04 <steveh> shouldn't have to choose~
17:14:05 <steveh> !
17:16:10 <jdrake> just choose brainf*ck
17:16:42 <Pseudonym> You can do anything with a Turing machine.
17:18:06 <jdrake> make it cook bread for me
17:18:18 <steveh> well
17:18:24 <steveh> I am looking for things that let me do useful things
17:18:33 <steveh> things that can get me gainfully employed in programming
17:18:37 <steveh> yet things that I enjoy
17:18:41 <jdrake> hmm
17:18:44 <jdrake> ocaml possibly
17:18:49 <steveh> hehe
17:18:54 <jdrake> c++ will make you insane though
17:18:59 <steveh> right now I am going through the OS X vermont recipes book
17:19:10 <steveh> objective-c >>> c++
17:19:15 <jdrake> use that then 
17:19:18 <jdrake> objc is great
17:19:28 <Pseudonym> You could make one simulate the cooking of bread.
17:21:00 <steveh> I think I will give myself 10 more minutes of IRC before returning to work on it.
17:21:56 <jdrake> just go back to work :)
20:02:50 <syntax-laptop> http://www.syntaxpolice.org/tmp/libraryInfrastructure/
20:02:59 <syntax-laptop> will probably be at www.haskell.org/libraryInfrastructure tomorrow
20:15:55 <ma]> surprise, surprise, lots of people here :)
20:16:55 <syntax-laptop> hi ma]
20:17:43 <ma]> I'm trying to do a B-Tree in haskell ... my first lager thing in hs
20:17:56 <syntax-laptop> cool! how's it going?
20:18:25 <syntax-laptop> (be warned though, I love helping people with Haskell, but I'm about to go to bed)
20:18:25 <Smerdyakov> I tell ya. The French and their ]'s....
20:18:39 <ma]> no question, it's useless, but the first prototype is in C, and *gly
20:18:43 * ma] is german
20:19:13 <Smerdyakov> Oh. I thought proxad was French.
20:19:55 * ma] is spending holliday in Nice, Cote d'Azur
20:21:33 <ma]> data Node b key content = Leaf content
20:21:34 <ma]>                         | Branch [K b key content] (Node b key content)
20:21:34 <ma]> data K b key content = Ky key (Node b key content)
20:22:12 <ma]> where the b should allow me to make trees with as many keys per node I want
20:25:12 <ma]> K is a pair of (1) a key and (2) a Node that contains keys smaller then (1);  the (Node b key content) in the 'Branch' is the 'pointer to the last node with keys larger then the last 'K' in the list'
20:26:24 <jdrake> he guys do you know a few problems that can help me  get more practise in something like ocaml, i figure that most sets of problems for haskell would be applicable to ocaml. 
20:26:26 <ma]> but the length of the list is not type checked (I have some background in Lisp, Scheme, ...)
20:28:00 <Tomasso> how do i demonstrate the ending of a function?
20:28:26 <Smerdyakov> Tomasso, what do you mean?
20:28:48 <Smerdyakov> jdrake, borrow a Haskell textbook from a library.
20:29:24 <steveh> the Okasaki book is good reading
20:29:27 <steveh> :)
20:30:26 <jdrake> i would be surprised if the library had such a book
20:30:30 <jdrake> but I can check
20:31:03 <ma]> I have some problems, with my data types above. How could I write a 'check' function that takes the 'b' and sees wether the length of the list is b-1
20:31:44 <Tomasso> mmmh
20:31:58 <Tomasso> that a function ends
20:32:10 <ma]> I would first have to add a 'NodeRoot' constructor, that passes in the b, no?
20:32:27 <Smerdyakov> ma], b is an arbitrary type there. If it's not a numeric type, then your statement makes no sense.
20:32:50 <ma]> ok, so let's replace the b with Int
20:32:53 <jdrake> nope, nothing about haskell
20:33:01 <jdrake> only some authors named haskell
20:33:16 <Smerdyakov> ma], OK, but I still don't understand what function you want.
20:34:36 <steveh> jdrake: wow, nice online catalog you got there :)
20:35:04 <jdrake> take a look if you want :-) http://catalogue.londonpubliclibrary.ca/search
20:35:20 <Smerdyakov> steveh, you use libraries that don't have online catalogues?
20:35:54 <steveh> Smerdyakov: back in my hometown
20:36:00 <steveh> here in the big city they have one
20:36:01 <steveh> :)
20:36:22 <Smerdyakov> That city is Columbus, Ohio?
20:36:31 <steveh> yup
20:36:42 <Smerdyakov> Hm. Not the most exciting of big cities, eh? ;)
20:37:24 <steveh> well
20:37:34 <steveh> saturdays in fall can get weird
20:38:11 <Smerdyakov> What are you doing there?
20:38:40 <steveh> right now I am doing a short-term contract as a tech writer
20:38:46 <steveh> my girlfriend is in medical school
20:39:18 <Smerdyakov> Ah. Is 'tech writer' your long term career plan?
20:39:24 <steveh> nope
20:39:50 <steveh> more of the programming aspect I hope
20:39:52 <jdrake> because when soviet russia takes over the tech writes you
20:40:30 <Smerdyakov> What's the highest degree you have?
20:40:44 <steveh> right now a bachelor's
20:40:48 <steveh> I am looking at more school
20:41:09 <Smerdyakov> Hm. Were we talking months ago about your pending applications for a masters in CS?
20:43:08 <steveh> i think perhaps
20:43:15 <steveh> i have selected a field
20:43:21 <steveh> of candidate schools
20:43:22 <steveh> ;)
20:43:54 <Smerdyakov> Is the list classified?
20:44:22 <clausen> Smerdyakov: do you have a homepage I can stalk? :)
20:44:36 <Smerdyakov> clausen, sure! http://www.schizomaniac.net/
20:44:55 <steveh> not at all
20:45:01 <Smerdyakov> clausen, though I can tell you haven't done your homework by searching for my IRC name, since I'm the only guy with that name on the 'net. :)
20:45:49 <clausen> true
20:47:15 <Smerdyakov> steveh, so what's the list? :)
20:47:21 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I prefer to stalk in a social way :)
20:47:35 <steveh> CMU, simon fraser, ohio state, yale, university of washington, miami of ohio, case western reserve university, uiuc, i am missing a few
20:47:53 <steveh> umich
20:48:09 <Smerdyakov> That is a pretty strange list.
20:48:15 <steveh> yep ;)
20:48:20 <Smerdyakov> How did you construct it?
20:48:35 <steveh> i am a cwru grad and ohio resident
20:48:42 <steveh> hence the ohio schools
20:48:50 <Smerdyakov> Ah. Is Simon Fraser Ohio?
20:48:52 <steveh> i had some classes at CMU
20:48:53 <steveh> nice
20:48:53 <steveh> no
20:48:58 <steveh> simon fraser is canada
20:49:16 <Smerdyakov> Why not Berkeley, MIT, or Stanford?
20:49:55 * clausen interested in Stanford
20:49:59 <steveh> wouldn't want to study at those places
20:50:08 <steveh> well
20:50:11 <steveh> maybe UCB
20:50:16 <Smerdyakov> steveh, why not the others?
20:50:29 <steveh> i had a friend who was miserable at MIT
20:50:32 <steveh> granted she was undergrad
20:50:40 <Smerdyakov> Ah. Single point sample. Good work. ;)
20:50:45 <jdrake> smerdy: http://www.classicreader.com/read.php/sid.1/bookid.276/sec.19/
20:50:46 <steveh> :-P
20:50:49 <Smerdyakov> What's your focus area of interest?
20:50:52 <jdrake> Book III: The Sensualists 
20:50:52 <jdrake> Chapter 6: Smerdyakov 
20:51:00 <jdrake> somebody got to it first
20:51:01 <steveh> simon fraser and UW are near a lot of my friends out west
20:51:23 <Smerdyakov> jdrake, by "IRC name," I mean the "realname" field in WHOIS info.
20:51:23 * clausen interested in PageRank and reputation, hence Stanford...
20:51:37 <Smerdyakov> clausen not speak English natively. Am I right? :)
20:51:43 <jdrake> Smerdyakov is also a first name
20:51:56 <Smerdyakov> jdrake, not a real one, and it's not mine.
20:51:58 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I do speak English natively
20:52:06 <steveh> programming languages, artificial intelligence, computer science education
20:52:12 <Smerdyakov> clausen, ah. You just hate the word "is."
20:52:21 <clausen> Smerdyakov: correct :)
20:52:34 <Smerdyakov> clausen, now you have to tell me who you are, since you are stalking me.
20:52:55 <clausen> Smerdyakov: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~adamc/ <-- 403
20:53:04 <clausen> Smerdyakov: members.optusnet.com.au/clausen
20:53:07 <Smerdyakov> steveh, ah. You definitely don't want to go to MIT or Stanford for that. :D
20:53:31 <Smerdyakov> clausen, I haven't set up the page yet. I like the air of "you're not cool enough" that the 403 gives instead of the expected 404, though. :D
20:53:32 <steveh> computer science education? certainly not
20:53:39 <steveh> there is the cliche
20:53:40 <Smerdyakov> steveh, no, PL.
20:53:48 <steveh> "those that can, do. those that can't, teach."
20:53:51 <Smerdyakov> steveh, that is my area, and I'm at Berkeley.
20:53:54 <clausen> Smerdyakov: *grin*
20:53:54 <steveh> what is left out is:
20:54:01 <steveh> "those that can, can't teach."
20:54:03 <steveh> :-P
20:54:20 <Smerdyakov> steveh, I think we're going to hire a new PL person this spring.
20:54:27 <Smerdyakov> steveh, so watch for interesting stuff!
20:54:46 <steveh> Smerdyakov: well, I'll probably send an application that way then
20:55:02 <Smerdyakov> steveh, do you know (of) George Necula?
20:55:06 <steveh> ever since reading Stoll's "The Cuckoo's Egg" when I was 12 I had a soft spot for UCB :)
20:55:27 <steveh> can't say that I do
20:57:06 <Smerdyakov> steveh, oh. Ever heard of proof-carrying code?
20:57:16 <steveh> yes
20:57:29 <Smerdyakov> clausen, a document on your web site says that Turing machines can do constant time random memory access, which is not true.
20:57:34 <Smerdyakov> steveh, well, he invented it. :)
20:57:43 <steveh> oh, neat :)
20:57:45 <Smerdyakov> steveh, he's my unofficial research advisor now.
20:57:54 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I agree this is not true.  Where did I say that?
20:57:55 <steveh> someone at CWRU was doing a brief research project on that
20:57:59 <steveh> undergrad
20:58:07 <Smerdyakov> clausen, http://members.optusnet.com.au/clausen/ideas/equivalence.txt
20:58:29 <clausen> yeah, but which sentence?
20:58:31 <clausen> (cut&paste?)
20:58:52 <steveh> typo
20:59:01 <steveh> "As computer scientists, we love Turing machines!  However, Turing machines
20:59:01 <steveh> can do constant-time random memory access"
20:59:05 <steveh> :)
20:59:20 <clausen> ah, thanks
20:59:21 <steveh> 't
20:59:22 <clausen> yes, it is a typo :)
20:59:34 <steveh> (quote t)
21:00:36 <Smerdyakov> clausen, if you ever need to attach a photo with a resume', DEFINITELY use http://members.optusnet.com.au/clausen/photos/minimalist/green-comfort.jpg
21:01:35 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I'm planning to work for a bit at the Australian version of SEC
21:01:51 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I wonder how that would work out with that photo :)
21:02:58 <Smerdyakov> clausen, why would you want to work for such an outfit?
21:03:10 <clausen> Smerdyakov: using PageRank to hunt insider traders could be fun :)
21:03:24 <Smerdyakov> Planting a tree is more fun.
21:03:41 <clausen> Smerdyakov: it's almost always good to have (small) exposure to lifestyles that are very different from your own
21:03:48 <Smerdyakov> Program verification is even more fun. :D
21:04:14 <clausen> I don't think I'd learn as much from planting a tree
21:04:14 <Smerdyakov> It's not ever a good idea to have (any) exposure to lifestyles that are much less healthy than your own.
21:04:28 <clausen> I don't think SEC is a health risk :p
21:04:39 <clausen> (well, not a longterm risk, anyway)
21:05:08 <serotonine> g'day
21:05:11 <Smerdyakov> I think thinking about money for too long is a health risk.
21:08:02 <clausen> Smerdyakov: I think not thinking about money for too long is a more serious health risk :p
21:08:46 <Pseudonym> Sorry, what's the Australian version of SEC?
21:08:51 <clausen> ASIC
21:08:55 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
21:09:25 <Pseudonym> Personally, I wouldn't recommend it as a long-term proposition.
21:09:45 <clausen> me neither
21:09:51 <clausen> I was thinking 3-6 months as an intern
21:09:52 <Pseudonym> I have six months of Commonwealth DPP on my resume.  That was about my limit.
21:10:47 <Pseudonym> BTW, if you're curious, I know how to launder money in Australia and get away with it. :-)
21:11:14 <Pseudonym> Or at the very least, create the maximum amount of boring, drudge grunt work for anyone who would investigate you.
21:12:02 <Pseudonym> Yeah, you probably wouldn't get away with it, but you would frustrate the investigators no end.
21:12:06 <clausen> Pseudonym: do tell...
21:12:20 <clausen> Pseudonym: btw, do you have any contacts with ASIC?
21:12:28 <Pseudonym> clausen: No, but I know people who do.
21:12:43 <Pseudonym> I think.
21:13:32 <Pseudonym> Well, I can't remember the details, but the general idea is that the AUSTRAC reporting system is poorly written.
21:13:46 <Pseudonym> Like good programmers, they sanity check every record.
21:14:10 <Pseudonym> What do they do with records which don't sanity check?  Well, they're dropped from the reports.
21:14:29 <clausen> ah
21:14:31 <Pseudonym> Except that those records are very often evidence of wrongdoing.
21:15:14 <Pseudonym> A cow-orker of mine spent a week trolling through the raw records trying to find the ones we wanted because they weren't reported through the normal channels.
21:15:41 <clausen> brilliant
21:18:41 <palomer> does haskell have macros?
21:23:24 <Smerdyakov> See Template Haskell
22:13:27 <harsha123> hi #haskell
22:13:56 <harsha123> shapr: hi
22:13:58 <harsha123> Pseudonym: hi
22:14:35 * palomer likes type classes
22:14:53 <Pseudonym> 'day.
22:17:11 <harsha123> Pseudonym: I was reading "Just for Fun..." .. pretty intersting..
22:17:50 <palomer> so, erm, template haskell is the same as macros?
22:21:37 <Pseudonym> harsha123: Er... what's that?  Is it someting I wrote?
22:21:53 <Smerdyakov> palomer, typed macros
22:22:02 <harsha123> Pseudonym: hmm it is a biography by Linus
22:22:05 <harsha123> :)
22:22:09 <Pseudonym> Ah. :-)
22:22:20 <Pseudonym> Seems to me that it's a bit premature to write a biography of Linus.
22:22:24 <Pseudonym> I thought so at the time.
22:22:42 <harsha123> Pseudonym: its autobiography actually hehehe
22:23:04 <harsha123> Pseudonym: btw.. do you have something you wrote?
22:23:19 <harsha123> Pseudonym: maybe i can read it too.. 
22:23:56 <Pseudonym> Not a lot, no.
22:24:11 <Pseudonym> I wrote a lot of stuff on the Haskell wiki.  I keep meaning to write more essays lately.
22:24:30 <Pseudonym> You interested in screenwriting?  I wrote a few articles on that for k5.
22:24:35 <harsha123> ok.. don't you write on general topics?
22:24:56 <harsha123> i like to read others views .. 
22:25:18 <Pseudonym> Not particularly general topics, no.  Just stuff that interests me.
22:25:37 <harsha123> ok..
22:25:49 <mgoetze|away> what are "general topics"?
22:25:59 <Pseudonym> I was curious about that too.
22:26:13 <harsha123> mgoetze|away: hehehe.. general=anything
22:26:27 <Pseudonym> Well I only write on specific topics at any given time.
22:26:37 <Pseudonym> They just happen to be different specific topics.
22:27:17 <harsha123> ok.. do you write on philosophy( your pet subject) ?
22:27:29 <mgoetze|away> Pseudonym: so then by harsha123's rather vague definition, you write on general topics :)
22:27:44 <Pseudonym> Actually, philosophy is _not_ one of my pet subjects.  Religion is.
22:28:02 <Pseudonym> I know far less about philosophy than I feel I should.
22:28:09 <harsha123> Hmmmm.. 
22:28:15 <harsha123> :-)
22:29:17 <Pseudonym> At the moment I'm learning all about quantum field theory.
22:29:45 * mgoetze|away dislikes religion
22:29:55 <Pseudonym> I think it's fascinating.
22:30:00 <Pseudonym> But each to their own.
22:30:06 <mgoetze|away> (particularily because it has a tendency to induce organized religion, which is something i really hate)
22:30:34 <Pseudonym> Yeah, it'd be fair to say that I hate organisations which are too political.
22:30:41 <harsha123> quantam field theory.. do you mean physics?
22:30:47 <Pseudonym> Yes, physics.
22:31:19 <harsha123> Pseudonym: what made you interested in quantam field theory
22:32:00 <Pseudonym> Well, quantum field theory is one step beyond quantum mechanics.  It takes you right up to the forefront of what theoretical physicists are working on today.
22:32:38 <Pseudonym> And I'm intensely curious about things like that.
22:32:40 <harsha123> Pseudonym: then you must read Brief History of Time .. by Stephen Hawking.
22:32:42 <palomer> quantum field?
22:32:49 <palomer> isn't that, erm, a contradiction?
22:32:55 <Pseudonym> Hawking is more of a general relativity kind of person.
22:33:01 <Pseudonym> That's also on my list. :-)
22:33:12 <Pseudonym> palomer: No it's not.
22:33:17 <palomer> thats like newtonian relativity!
22:33:21 <harsha123> Pseudonym: :-) but he talks a lot of quantam physics
22:33:25 <Pseudonym> It's been a while since I read Hawking.
22:33:34 <Pseudonym> Yes, he does.  But as I said, it's been a while.
22:34:10 <Pseudonym> palomer: Not really.  It's the extension of classical field theory to quantum mechanics.
22:34:11 <palomer> isn't a field a 4 dimensional continuous function?
22:34:29 <Pseudonym> Uhm... kind of.
22:34:38 <palomer> doesn't quantum mechanics deal with discrete constructs?
22:34:40 <harsha123> palomer: hehehe.. thats what is troubling scientists.. 
22:35:11 <palomer> I always thought a field was an approximation
22:35:41 <palomer> oh, and does everyone know agree that the changing of electron states does have a perfectly random element in it?
22:35:50 <palomer> s/know/now
22:35:50 <harsha123> Pseudonym:  i think you should also read "The Tao of Physics"
22:35:57 <Smerdyakov> I read that book.
22:36:04 <Pseudonym> I think of a field as any function defined over your configuration space.
22:36:15 <Pseudonym> Which may include time, for time-dependent fields.
22:36:27 <Smerdyakov> Certainly much more for the Taoism than the physics
22:37:34 <palomer> how do physicists think of causality now?
22:37:34 <Pseudonym> See, the thing about quantum physics is that once you get above a certain energy level, you get particle-antiparticle pairs getting created and destroyed all over the place.
22:37:48 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, and guess who has to clean up all that mess.
22:37:50 <Pseudonym> So that no event can really be described accurately as a single-particle system.
22:37:51 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, ME.
22:37:55 <Pseudonym> LOL
22:38:05 <Smerdyakov> Yeah, laugh all you want, wise guy.
22:38:17 <palomer> night
22:38:20 <Pseudonym> Night.
22:38:43 <Pseudonym> So, at relativistic energies, you really need to describe even single-particle systems as fields.
22:39:21 <Pseudonym> Which Smerdyakov has to weed.
22:40:18 <Pseudonym> harsha123: If you're curious, have a look here.
22:40:21 <Pseudonym> http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/4/27/74238/9733
22:40:29 <Pseudonym> I think that's sufficiently "general topic" for you.
22:40:38 <Pseudonym> You'll have to start from part 1, but the links are there.
22:40:39 <Smerdyakov> I feel an aversion to physics today.
22:40:44 <harsha123> Pseudonym: at present I am only seeing stars.. 
22:40:48 <Smerdyakov> I prefer to just "go with the flow." :-)
22:41:14 <Pseudonym> By "flow", I assume you're referring to some kind of canonical transform.  Is it active or passive?
22:41:34 <Smerdyakov> Oh, well, I'll go find a canon to transform and find out.
22:42:07 <Smerdyakov> (I find that particularly funny after reading a book about 13th century Italy and environs.)
22:43:38 <harsha123> Pseudonym: were you/are you a physics student ?
22:43:45 <Pseudonym> I was for a while.
22:44:19 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, because you didn't know about CS when you started? :)
22:44:41 <Pseudonym> No, I knew about CS>
22:44:47 <Pseudonym> But I found I was better at it.
22:44:59 <harsha123> Pseudonym: what do you think about Logical thinking. do you think it is inborn or do you think it can be cultivated?
22:45:02 <Pseudonym> Physics is interesting, but actual live physics students have to sit through
22:45:10 <Pseudonym> four hour lab classes and intergrate horrible functions.
22:45:26 <Smerdyakov> Ah. You don't seem to be quite old enough to fall into the category of all the CS emereti today, who started out in either math, EE, or physics. :)
22:45:34 <Pseudonym> No. :-)
22:45:49 <Pseudonym> Though I do predate most software engineering courses.
22:46:09 <Smerdyakov> So what. I was born naked.
22:46:19 <Pseudonym> Me too!  Wow!
22:46:31 <harsha123> hehehe.. who wasn't ?
22:46:35 <Pseudonym> harsha123: I think logical thinking is overrated.
22:46:37 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, here's a book for you: Where Mathematics Comes From
22:46:51 <Pseudonym> I think it's great in many niche areas.
22:46:54 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, convincing arguments that "logical thinking" is based on analogy from human senses.
22:47:06 <Pseudonym> Really?  That's interesting.
22:47:06 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, so it is inborn, but not terribly "transcendental."
22:47:28 <Pseudonym> "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things" argues that human senses are not what we think they are.
22:47:41 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, the whole book is developing physical analogies for the meaning of "e^ipi = -1". :D
22:47:45 <Pseudonym> That our senses are actually linguistic.
22:47:55 <Pseudonym> And have little to do with the physical world.
22:48:17 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: That could either be really, really cool or completely kooky.
22:48:30 <Pseudonym> Kind of like "A New Kind of Science" in that respect.
22:48:45 <Pseudonym> It's way, way out there, but you really can't bring yourself to call Wolfram a kook.
22:48:51 <Smerdyakov> Hm. Less readable than ANKOS, I think. :)
22:48:56 <Pseudonym> :-)
22:48:56 <Smerdyakov> Oh wait
22:48:59 <Smerdyakov> I confused my brain
22:49:01 <Smerdyakov> Probably more
22:49:12 <Smerdyakov> But less people would think it would be interesting to read.
22:49:27 <Smerdyakov> I came upon it in a conspicuous place in a Harvard Square bookstore and bought it. :)
22:50:23 <Pseudonym> I did a search for that book in the RMIT uni library and got only one book which matched, and it's called "Practical design calculations for groundwater and soil remediation".
22:50:48 <Smerdyakov> http://perso.unifr.ch/rafael.nunez/welcome.html
22:50:57 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: whats that?
22:51:07 <Pseudonym> Oh, it's George Lakoff!
22:51:09 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, it's the book we've been talking about for the last 5 minutes.
22:51:14 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, you smelly badger.
22:51:16 <Pseudonym> He wrote "Women Fire and Dangerous Things".
22:51:29 <Pseudonym> So I guess they're _not_ contradicting each other.
22:51:53 <Pseudonym> I've liked every Lakoff book I've read, so this might be a good buy.
22:51:55 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: i was actually searching if i could read that online :))
22:51:56 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, it appears that he included commas as appropriate.
22:52:45 <Smerdyakov> Hm. Maybe I will check this one out of the library, too.
22:52:54 <Smerdyakov> Since MY library has EVERY BOOK, in 16 different editions.
22:53:04 <Pseudonym> Also good is "Metaphors We Live By".
22:53:18 <Pseudonym> I'd be curious to know what you think about "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things".
22:53:32 <Smerdyakov> That would be a funny sentence if overheard waiting for a bus.
22:53:37 * Pseudonym laughs
22:53:38 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
22:53:51 <Pseudonym> The title is interesting, actually.
22:54:10 <Pseudonym> It comes from an Australian Aboriginal language.  Walpiri, I think.  Or Djirbal, maybe.
22:54:17 * harsha123 thinks how do these guys MANAGE TIME
22:54:34 * harsha123 SUX at TIME management :(
22:54:43 <Pseudonym> Anyway, most European languages have gendered nouns, where the  genders are nominally "masculine", "feminie" and maybe "neuter".
22:54:48 <Pseudonym> Well this language has four "genders".
22:54:59 <harsha123> 4 genders????
22:55:17 <harsha123> which is the 4th?
22:55:21 <Pseudonym> One of them is "men and animals", one is "edible plants", one is "women, fire and dangerous things" and the other is everything else.
22:55:45 <Pseudonym> harsha123: Genders are just grammatical categories.
22:55:47 <mgoetze|away> haha, women, fire and dangerous things, i like it already :)
22:55:56 <harsha123> hehehe..
22:55:58 <harsha123> Ok
22:56:11 <Pseudonym> It actually makes sense, because in their culture, the Sun is female.
22:56:21 <harsha123> but you guys didnt answer how.. you go about managing time?
22:56:36 <Pseudonym> harsha123: I commute on the train.  I read a lot.
22:56:38 <harsha123> Sun is a male in indian religion
22:56:47 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, time for what?
22:57:02 <Pseudonym> "Genders" usually don't have much to do with biological sexes.
22:57:04 <Smerdyakov> Aha. The library here has 2 of the 5 copies of the book available.
22:57:14 <Pseudonym> Why else would the Germans say "das Maedchen" with a straight face?
22:57:17 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: time to do what you want to do..
22:57:28 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, it's easy. I shirk responsibilities.
22:57:54 <Pseudonym> Oh, I do that too.
22:58:05 <harsha123> hehehe... a clever *unsocial*  but maybe effective way..
22:58:14 <Smerdyakov> On this subject, I stayed up way too late reading on Saturday and was dead for all of Sunday.
22:58:15 <Pseudonym> "Managing" is the wrong word for what I do with time.
22:58:20 <Pseudonym> "Waste" would be closer to it.
22:58:40 * harsha123 laughs at Pseudonym
22:59:56 * Smerdyakov laughs at harsha123 for not figuring out the secret yet.
23:00:05 <Smerdyakov> You have to be like Scotty from Star Trek.
23:00:13 <Smerdyakov> Tell 'em you'll take longer than you need.
23:00:22 <Pseudonym> That's precisely it.
23:00:26 <Smerdyakov> And do it in less, so you get a reputation as a miracle worker.
23:00:37 <Pseudonym> Another thing which helps is to set yourself up as indispensible.
23:00:40 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: Ok
23:00:49 <Pseudonym> Don't tell them what you do for a living.
23:01:14 <Pseudonym> That way they think you're a) busy doing other things, so they don't disturb you as much, and b) the only one who can possibly solve their problem.
23:01:36 <harsha123> Pseudonym: :)
23:01:36 <Pseudonym> When you solve it ahead of schedule, you're a miracle worker.
23:01:45 <harsha123> always
23:02:10 <Smerdyakov> Another popular strategy is to do all the fun stuff before you turn 19.
23:02:20 <Pseudonym> That indeed helps.
23:03:08 <Smerdyakov> I was talking to a professor at a grad school visit, and we discovered how we had the same taste in books, and we talked about it for a while, and then he said he didn't have time to read anymore. Very sad. :(
23:03:33 <Pseudonym> That's awful.
23:03:55 <harsha123> hehehe. which school was it??
23:04:06 <Smerdyakov> UPenn
23:04:07 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: Havard,MIT??
23:04:18 <harsha123> Hmm.. U Penn is amazing..
23:04:24 <Smerdyakov> Those folks are rich.
23:04:33 <Smerdyakov> They think they can buy a reputation for the CS dept. or something. ;)
23:04:35 <harsha123> i guess rich in all ways
23:04:43 <Pseudonym> When you have money you have responsibility, though.
23:04:49 <Pseudonym> That's not good.
23:05:27 <Smerdyakov> Yeah, sorta like if Spider Man had been Tycoon Man instead. He might have said that.
23:06:23 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: am not sure.. is U Penn called Penn State ?
23:06:58 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, oh, helllll no, brotha!
23:07:16 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, the University of Pennsylvania is an Ivy League school.
23:07:17 * harsha123 is ignorant.. 
23:07:31 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, Pennsylvania State University is .... a state school that is good for a state school. :)
23:07:38 <Pseudonym> harsha123: Go to a good university.  You won't be ignorant after that.
23:08:19 <harsha123> Pseudonym:  i've been to one.. actually ;)
23:08:25 <ibid> what's ivy league?
23:08:31 <Pseudonym> Well why are you ignorant, then?
23:08:37 <harsha123> Pseudonym: do ya mean go to a Ivy Leauge Univ? ;)
23:08:49 <Pseudonym> Didn't the information fairy bestow non-ignorance on you?
23:09:23 <Smerdyakov> ibid, a group of American universities united in snootyness. Well-regarded academically by the American public.
23:09:26 <harsha123> not exactly
23:09:44 <Pseudonym> In Australia, we have a similar concept known as "sandstone universities".
23:09:46 <Smerdyakov> ibid, most of them suck in practical subjects. :D
23:09:47 <ibid> Smerdyakov: "american public" what about academicians?
23:09:55 <Pseudonym> Except that they're all public universities.
23:10:21 <Smerdyakov> ibid, oh, that depends on their areas.
23:10:31 <Pseudonym> Are the "seven sisters" ivy league?
23:10:31 <Smerdyakov> ibid, people in traditional areas view them as excellent as well.
23:10:33 <Pseudonym> Or are they different?
23:10:45 <Smerdyakov> ibid, in engineering and such, they are generally laughterworthy. :)
23:11:06 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, I think that's separate.
23:11:10 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
23:11:55 <Pseudonym> Yes, as I understand it, ivy league universities are for snooty people who want to make obscene amounts of money in snooty fields like medicine or law.
23:12:30 <Pseudonym> It helps if said obscene amounts of money are made with the minimal benefit to society as a whole.
23:12:31 <Darius> Don't they usually require obscene amounts of money in the first place.
23:12:32 <Smerdyakov> A bunch have caught up quickly in CS, though.
23:12:38 <harsha123> Pseudonym: not necessarily.. in engineering, i think money is not what drives them
23:12:46 <Smerdyakov> Cornell and Princeton are in the USNews CS PhD top 10.
23:12:52 * Pseudonym nods
23:12:54 <Pseudonym> That's true.
23:12:55 <ibid> in finland, generally all universities have one or two excellence areas and are mediocre-to-good in others; then there are the "vocational universities" which ... are a whole different matter.  university of helsinki is, of course, the most famed and has many excellence areas
23:12:56 <Smerdyakov> And Penn and Yale are in the top 20.
23:13:02 <ibid> being the oldest...
23:13:37 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  Yale is in top 10 i believe
23:13:55 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, actually, I think it was over 20. :\
23:14:16 <Pseudonym> Yes, but if you want to do CS, you can forget, say, Duke.
23:14:16 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, they have a tiny department with very narrow specialties and very mediocre grad students.
23:14:27 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  really?
23:14:32 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, yes
23:14:52 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  i always had a high regard to Yale
23:15:10 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, the regard of someone not familiar with the academic scene :)
23:15:33 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: Infact i had an admission at Umass Dartmouth.. how good is that?
23:15:39 <Pseudonym> Yale law school is supposed to be very good.
23:15:44 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, of course, one of the specialties at Yale is functional programming and related sorts of PL things. :)
23:15:58 <Pseudonym> But it's interesting that Harvard, one of the birthplaces of RISC, ain't there on the list.
23:16:00 <ibid> then there are the big unis in tampere and jyväskylä (and perhaps elsewhere), which grew from specialized universities in the 60's (jyväskylä's was a college of education i think)
23:16:00 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: yeah thats Haskell ;)
23:16:08 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, aren't those two separate schools..?
23:16:21 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  Umass at Dartmouth..
23:16:41 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, oh... never heard of it.
23:16:48 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: hehehehe..
23:17:13 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: btw, are you a grad student?
23:17:48 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, yup, since August. :)
23:18:00 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: which school?
23:18:06 <Smerdyakov> UC Berkeley
23:18:11 <Pseudonym> And you're doing a PhD in getting away with as little as possible?
23:18:29 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: thats my dream.. but :(
23:18:31 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, well, I have this fellowship that lets me do that without worrying about eating. :)
23:18:38 <Pseudonym> Ah, that's good.
23:18:50 <Pseudonym> Getting someone else to pay for your food habit is a definite plus.
23:19:07 <Smerdyakov> I'm trying to avoid burning out early on.
23:19:10 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: a lot of Indian Profs at UC Berk. right?
23:19:20 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, compared to what baseline?
23:19:30 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, almost all the professors that I see are white males.
23:19:43 <Pseudonym> There are a disproportionate number of Indian academic types here in Australia.
23:19:46 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: hehehe.. 
23:19:49 <Pseudonym> Probably geographic proximity.
23:19:49 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, maybe 3 Indian professors in CS.
23:20:04 <shapr> I see a disproportionate number of Swedish academics where I live.
23:20:13 <Pseudonym> shapr: G'day!
23:20:16 <harsha123> shapr: hi
23:20:19 <Pseudonym> Disproportionate to what?
23:20:21 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym 
23:20:23 <shapr> hi harsha123 
23:20:33 <shapr> disproportionate to anything else?
23:20:50 <Pseudonym> Disproportionate to non-Swedish non-academic settings?
23:20:57 <shapr> right, exactly
23:20:59 <shapr> :-)
23:21:14 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: did ya have to give a subject Test in CS ?
23:21:19 <Pseudonym> Actually, I have noticed there are a lot of academics around this university.
23:21:22 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, I was right! Exactly 3 Indian CS professors out of 58.
23:21:27 <shapr> Pseudonym: yes, there ya go
23:21:30 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, do you mean subject GRE?
23:21:37 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  yep
23:21:40 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, I did
23:21:58 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: how was it like? difficult? 'cause i plan to give one soon
23:22:58 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, not really difficult. I hadn't taken classes covering significant chunks of it, and I still ended up in the 93rd percentile.
23:23:36 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, there's NOTHING thought-provoking on it. It's all regurgitation, essentially.
23:23:50 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: you must have taken the Math Subject test too!
23:24:19 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, no. You generally only take one.
23:24:34 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, grad school is about specialization, after all!
23:24:40 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: ok
23:24:51 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: what do ya specialize in?
23:24:59 <Smerdyakov> CS..
23:25:38 <Smerdyakov> You're planning for grad school and you haven't realized that you have to choose a subject yet? :D
23:25:47 <harsha123> Yes CS.. dont you have a major subject? compilers, OS.. something like that?
23:25:56 <Pseudonym> Of course not!
23:26:04 <Pseudonym> You only have to propose a topic.
23:26:10 <Pseudonym> You don't have to stick to it.
23:26:15 <harsha123> ahh Ok.. 
23:26:25 <harsha123> i thought you'll have to stick to it
23:26:29 <Pseudonym> The topic of your thesis is precisely what you did when you finish it.
23:26:48 <Smerdyakov> harsha123, my current ostensible area is programming languages.
23:26:55 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  Ok
23:27:14 <Smerdyakov> And now I am going to sleep.
23:27:30 <harsha123> nite Smerdyakov
23:27:42 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: are ya back? :)
23:27:51 <harsha123> Smerdyakov:  maybe tomorrow? ;)
23:28:06 <Pseudonym> Night.
23:31:59 * shapr yawns
23:34:53 <harsha123> shapr: whats a frame buffer?
23:35:31 <shapr> it's a direct way to address the video ram
23:35:53 <harsha123> hmm Ok.
23:35:53 <Pseudonym> Technically, a frame buffer _is_ the video ram.
23:36:10 <Pseudonym> But I know what you mean. :-)
23:36:15 <shapr> it allows you to write to the video ram as if it were a part of the cpus memory
23:37:52 <harsha123> but when you are compiling a kernel you have an opition to select frame buffer.. what difference does it exactly make if i chose it?
23:38:09 * Darius curses TH or GHC
23:40:58 <Pseudonym> Well, it depends.
23:41:13 <Pseudonym> The idea is that different video cards allow access to their framebufers in different ways.
23:41:38 <Pseudonym> So you need some kind of driver sitting between the hardware and user programs.
23:41:56 <Pseudonym> Traditionally, this driver has been in user space, say, inside the X server.
23:42:13 <Pseudonym> Modern linux lets the kernel handle that.
23:42:29 <Pseudonym> So that framebuffers are available to other programs, not just the X server.
23:42:43 <harsha123> ok ....
23:44:03 <harsha123> so when X Server needs to access a frame buffer for what ever may be the reason .. it does it thro' a video driver?
23:44:24 <Pseudonym> Yes.
23:44:42 <Pseudonym> One of the reasons for this is that there's only a limited amount of memory allocated for mapping the frame buffer into the CPU's memory.
23:44:55 <Pseudonym> So you need to tell the hardware which bit of the framebuffer you want to access.
23:46:15 <harsha123> then there should be *someone* whoz managing this.. since it is a kind of memory.. is that done by the MMU?
23:46:38 <Pseudonym> Well, if you compile framebuffer support into the kernel, then the kernel handles it.
23:46:58 <harsha123> aaahh Ok
23:47:19 <Pseudonym> Well, yes.  The framebuffer is mapped by the hardware into some area of physical memory.  Then the kernel or user program needs that mapped into its address space.
23:48:04 * Darius thinks he'll continue using Sylpheed.
23:48:06 <Pseudonym> But you also need to manipulate the hardware for various things.
23:48:34 <harsha123> Ok..
23:48:53 <Pseudonym> Like, for example, saying which bit of video ram you want mapped into your address space.
23:49:10 <harsha123> i see.
23:50:04 <Pseudonym> And, of course, stuff to set the video mode.
23:50:19 <harsha123> Ok
23:51:05 * mgoetze|away thinks he'll continue using mutt
