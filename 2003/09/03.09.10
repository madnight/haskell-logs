00:00:49 <Verbed> Hello.
00:01:45 <shapr> wassup?
00:03:27 <Verbed> Absorbed in David Bowie's latest work and accomplishing very little.
00:03:36 <shapr> what's his latest work?
00:03:58 <Verbed> 'Reality', it is offically released in 9 days.
00:04:02 <shapr> ah
00:11:20 <Pseudonym> G'day.
00:11:24 <shapr> hey Pseudonym 
00:11:29 * Pseudonym is sorting
00:11:36 * shapr is sordid
00:13:35 <earthy> then shouldn't you be taking a shower?
00:13:42 <shapr> probably so :-)
00:14:32 * earthy sighs. the world is unfair.
00:14:45 <Pseudonym> Wow, really?
00:14:47 * Pseudonym didn't know that
00:15:30 <earthy> (more explanation: there's this silly swede that's going to manage one of the bigger retail-companies in .nl. He's making roughly EUR 4 million a year, *excluding* bonuses and stock options)
00:15:45 * ibid almost quotes marcus cole :)
00:16:26 <earthy> (the severance package negotiated for if he *doesn't* do his work well is even worse: he gets to take EUR 12 million home)
00:17:13 <shapr> hoi kosmikus 
00:17:18 <shapr> gutentag galority 
00:20:42 <kosmikus> good morning
00:24:39 <earthy> interesting, how shapr tries to greet people in their native languages.
00:25:10 <Pseudonym> Saluton shapr!
00:25:27 * Pseudonym thinks . o O ( It might be worth learning Klingon just to confuse shapr )
00:25:41 <earthy> Q'aplaH Shapr!
00:27:10 <Lor> nuqneH!
00:27:28 <earthy> whoa there, I don't have my dictionary handy!
00:27:36 <Pseudonym> You have a dictionary?
00:27:39 <Pseudonym> GEEK!
00:27:54 <earthy> why, thank you. :)
00:28:10 * Pseudonym notes that when the pot calls the kettle black, this does not make the kettle non-black
00:28:28 <earthy> nor the pot
00:29:24 <Pseudonym> Precisely.
00:29:52 <Pseudonym> My point is that calling you a geek does not make my observation incorrect, just because I'm a geek myself.
00:30:11 <Pseudonym> Which, I think, is what people are trying to imply by invoking that phrase "pot calling the kettle black".
00:30:15 <earthy> and I graciously thanked you for the compliment. :)
00:30:20 <Pseudonym> Indeed!
00:30:52 <Pseudonym> Now here's a think.
00:30:59 <Pseudonym> My former employer: http://www.monash.edu.au/
00:31:07 <Pseudonym> Compare with: http://gaylifeexpo.com/gaylifeexpo/index.html
00:31:11 <earthy> pseudonym: `the pot calling the kettle black' only implies that while the kettle may well be black, the pot definitely is so as well, then.
00:31:20 <Pseudonym> Uhm, yes.
00:31:39 <Pseudonym> The thing is, the dialogue usually goes something like this:
00:31:47 <Pseudonym> <Pot> Kettle: You're black!
00:31:50 <ibid> earthy: a local klingon expert asks me to relay to you this question: "What does Q'aplaH mean?" :)
00:31:57 <Pseudonym> <Kettle> Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!
00:32:02 <Darius> The pot calling the kettle black, is just that the "pot" has no room to critisize the "kettle".
00:32:22 <shapr> ibid: it means 'victory'
00:32:31 <Pseudonym> Well that depends.
00:32:36 <earthy> ibid: I may have misspelled it.
00:32:59 <Pseudonym> @wn critic
00:33:01 <lambdabot> *** "critic" wn "WordNet (r) 1.7"
00:33:01 <lambdabot> critic
00:33:01 <lambdabot>      n 1: a person who is professionally engaged in the analysis and
00:33:01 <lambdabot>           interpretation of works of art
00:33:01 <lambdabot>      2: anyone who expresses a reasoned judgment of something
00:33:03 <lambdabot>      3: someone who frequently finds fault or makes harsh and unfair
00:33:04 <Darius> Yes, but that's the usual usage (in my experience).
00:33:05 <lambdabot>         judgments
00:33:11 <Pseudonym> Note sense 2.
00:33:38 <Pseudonym> The pot clearly has much scope to criticise the kettle if the pot is an expert on blackness.
00:34:10 <Darius> E.g. the dialog is more like <DirtyBastardA> You dirty bastard! <DirtyBastardB> Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
00:34:13 <ibid> earthy: i think you have but i am not an expert in klingon :)
00:34:14 <Pseudonym> Which, being black, it may well.
00:34:33 <Pseudonym> @geekcred- ibid
00:34:34 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "geekcred-", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
00:34:49 <ibid> the expert says: "victory = yay. success = Qapla'"
00:35:22 <Pseudonym> The thing is, DirtyBastardA is still correct even in that dialogue.
00:35:41 <Pseudonym> The retort seems little more than an ad hominem attack to me.
00:35:48 <ibid> and adds: "}}:-)"
00:35:57 <Pseudonym> Though I suppose it's an appropriate apply _to_ an ad hominem attack.
00:36:09 <Darius> Pseudonym: that's because it is
00:36:10 <Pseudonym> Fighting ad hominem with ad hominem, as it were.
00:37:02 <ibid> Pseudonym: don't keep me in suspense :)
00:37:21 <Pseudonym> Huh?
00:37:22 <Darius> When used, quite opposite of declaring the "pot" incorrect, it accepts it as correct.
00:37:29 <Pseudonym> Were we talking about something?
00:37:39 <ibid> Pseudonym: 10:34  <Pseudonym> @geekcred- ibid
00:37:51 <Pseudonym> Oh, it was in response to you being not a Klingon expert.
00:38:07 <Pseudonym> karma wasn't the right thing to decrement.
00:38:13 <earthy> ibid: he is very much more well-versed in tlHingan-Hol than I am.
00:38:20 <ibid> yes it was, i'm just wondering what it isn't supposed to mean... oh:)
00:38:28 <earthy> (this is probably misspelled as well ;))
00:38:57 <Pseudonym> ibid: Have you ever read... I think it's Pyramids?  The Pratchett novel.
00:39:01 <ibid> no
00:39:04 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
00:39:17 <ibid> not read any pratchett, though i hear i should
00:39:50 <Pseudonym> There are a bunch of Not Greek philosophers arguing, and one of them says "That's the problem with you, ibid.  You're such a bloody know-it-all."
00:40:04 <ibid> earthy: "tlhIngan Hol", i hear
00:40:30 <ibid> they use "ibid"?
00:40:52 <ibid> which is, i suppose, quite appropriate, considering what ibid means :)
00:41:14 <Pseudonym> Yeah, exactly.
00:41:25 <Pseudonym> It's like in music, they talk about the prolific composer, Anon.
00:41:32 <ibid> exactly :)
00:41:37 <Pseudonym> He had a brother who composed a lot, too.  Trad.
00:41:41 <ibid> :)
00:41:52 <earthy> pseudonym: you have also learned the joy that is  stock foto's? :)
00:41:57 <Pseudonym> Yeah.
00:42:10 <Pseudonym> Oh, my wife is a graphic designer.  I know all about them.
00:42:23 <Pseudonym> You'd think that a university could afford a photographer of their own students, though.
00:42:37 <Pseudonym> Sorry, a photograph of their own students.
00:42:45 <Pseudonym> I know professional photographers are pricey, but still./
00:43:13 <earthy> pseudonym: the average university, at least in .nl, employs one or maybe 2 professional photographers...
00:43:37 <Pseudonym> Right.
00:43:49 <Pseudonym> Ah well.
00:43:57 <earthy> but then again, the average dutch university also has its own in-university magazine. ;)
00:43:58 <Pseudonym> At least they're celebrating diversity and all that.
00:44:04 <Pseudonym> Well so does MOnash.
00:44:08 <ibid> earthy: the expert wishes you luck in learning  klingon :)
00:44:14 <Pseudonym> It is the biggest university in the Southern Hemisphere.
00:44:18 <earthy> ibid: I have no intention to. :)
00:44:29 <ibid> hmm?
00:44:45 <earthy> I'm going to learn Portuguese, French and Spanish *first* ;)
00:45:23 <shapr> hey, have I already told you all that I passed my SFI test yesterday? :-)
00:45:51 <earthy> yeah, you did. :) Gefeliciteerd! Gratuliere! Congratulations!
00:45:57 <shapr> I can speak swedish at the basically functional level according to experts :-)
00:46:00 * shapr bounces happily
00:46:07 <shapr> all my studying has paid off!
00:46:22 <shapr> earthy: parlez vous franÁais?
00:46:30 <shapr> habla espaÒol?
00:46:38 <Pseudonym> Congrats!
00:46:48 * ibid is officially able to speak swedish enough to be given a government job in a two-language area :)
00:46:51 * shapr pretends to have a clue in french and spanish
00:46:56 <Pseudonym> So this means you can, what, understand a Swedish sitcom?
00:46:56 <shapr> ibid: det ‰r bra
00:47:00 <shapr> Pseudonym: yes!
00:47:10 <ibid> shapr: det ‰r komisk :)
00:47:13 <ibid> +t
00:47:16 <ibid> i think
00:47:16 <shapr> also means I can write letters to businesses, make emergency phone calls, that sort of stuff
00:47:22 <Pseudonym> Cool.
00:47:44 <Pseudonym> Must dash.
00:47:47 <Pseudonym> Nytol!
00:47:52 <shapr> g'night
00:48:53 <shapr> so, the second part starts today.
00:48:59 <Darius> shapr: so what would you do a week ago if your house was burning down?
00:50:25 <shapr> speaks english on the emergency phone call? ;-)
00:52:13 <earthy> shapr: je ne parle plus qu'un petit peu francais, no hablo espa~nol, mas comprendo
00:52:52 <shapr> tres bien :-)
00:53:13 <shapr> je parle seulement un peu francais aussi
00:53:35 <shapr> of course, a little bit of french means different things in belgium versus the US
00:54:03 * earthy managed to make himself understood in southern france, but not more than that.
00:54:29 <shapr> since french in spoken as one of the languages in the next country over from you...
00:54:35 <shapr> s/in/is
00:54:51 <earthy> err, yeah. ;)
00:55:06 <earthy> and we have french TV if we want it
02:23:44 <shapr> hej ski
02:23:48 <shapr> hur ‰r det med dig?
02:23:48 <ski> hej
02:23:52 <ski> bra :)
02:24:34 <ski> jag haoller pao med en algoritm-kurs nu ..
02:25:23 <shapr> vem ‰r din l‰rare?
02:25:56 <ski> hmm, vaenta ..
02:27:55 * Marvin-- tries to remember if he knows who md9slj is :)
02:29:44 <shapr> gutentag elmex 
02:29:52 <elmex> shapr: hi
02:29:59 <shapr> wie geht es? :-)
02:30:43 <elmex> shapr: gut?
02:30:51 <shapr> jag hoppas
02:30:53 <shapr> er
02:30:54 <ski> shapr : Peter Damaschke
02:31:02 <shapr> ski: you're Peter Damaschke?
02:31:06 <ski> no
02:31:12 <ski> my teacher !
02:31:14 <shapr> oh!
02:31:45 <Marvin--> heh
02:31:50 <Marvin--> Damaschke is really good
02:32:11 <shapr> his online stuff looks spiffy
02:32:17 * Marvin-- screams in frustration at his program
02:34:11 <Marvin--> shapr: oh by the way, Koen thought of a really neat way of handling higher order functions in my project!
02:34:18 <shapr> cool!
02:34:24 <shapr> what is it?
02:34:35 <ski> Marvin-- : what is your project ?
02:35:35 <Marvin--> it's quite obvious, really, instead of mapping haskell functions to first order logic functions, we let functions (just as values) be first order values, and have a special 'app' FOL function... when you think of it, it really makes no sense to let haskell functions be anything else than values, because values is what they are
02:36:41 <Marvin--> shapr: so instead of translating  f x = E  to  f(X) = E  we translate it to   app(f, X) = E  and  all of a sudden it's quite possible to write  app(app(map, f), Xs)
02:36:41 <ski> a -> b  == exists x. (x,(x,a) #-> b)  ??
02:37:25 <Marvin--> ski: my project is about encoding haskell programs in first order logic and letting an automatic theorem prover find bugs for me (since they will show up as contradictions)
02:37:44 <ski> Marvin-- : ok,hm
02:38:08 <shapr> btw, you may be able to use Martin Sulzmann's constraint handling stuff to preprocess programs for QuickProve
02:38:19 <Darius> Marvin--: isn't that the typical way to handle higher-order functions in a first-order language/logic/etc.?
02:38:21 <ski> Marvin-- : do you build closures manually ?
02:38:35 <Marvin--> Darius: yes, we were feeling very stupid when we realized it
02:38:47 <Marvin--> ski: yes
02:38:52 <Darius> i.e. take the necessary higher-order combinator as a primitive
02:39:05 <Marvin--> Darius: stop now, you're making me blush even more :P
02:39:25 * Marvin-- wanders off in search of coffee
02:39:30 * shapr goes off to his first day of Swedish Part Two - The Revenge
02:39:35 <ski> Darius : what combinator ?  app ?
02:41:53 <Darius> not necessarily app, but yes.  Also, I used 'combinator' more because I didn't want to say "higher-order primitive"
02:42:20 <ski> but does it have to be primitive ?
02:42:41 <ski> can't it be defined as a first-order function ?
02:43:17 <Marvin--> well, in my case it will be, since app will be defined by the definition of haskell functions...   app(f, X) = E
02:43:19 <ski> (i assume first-order means no free variables here)
02:43:46 <Marvin--> which means  "for all X, app(f, X) = E"
02:44:15 <ski> Marvin-- : aha, you convert a haskell fun.def. to a rule for defining app, no ?
02:44:46 <Marvin--> yes
02:45:06 <Marvin--> whereas I previously mapped haskell fun.defs directly to fol functions
02:45:12 <Marvin--> saying f(X) = E
02:45:32 <ski> a little similar to, in Mercury, a function definition, is, sort of, a definition clause for the predicate =/2
02:46:26 <ski> no ?
02:46:46 <Marvin--> haven't used mercury
02:47:18 <ski> (me neither, only read about it)
02:47:27 <Darius> Marvin--: Have you heard of defunctionalization?
02:48:18 <Marvin--> Darius: yes
02:48:34 <ski> what is it ?
02:48:59 <Marvin--> but that won't even be necessary with a scheme like this... all that's needed are unique names for nested functions and that they get all the arguments they need, if you follow me
02:49:40 * Marvin-- now has coffee, all is well with the world
02:50:25 <Darius> ski:  I made up a page on the wiki a little while ago, it has some decent links
02:51:21 <Marvin--> on hawiki?
02:51:41 <Marvin--> doesn't seem to exist... or at least one of us can't spell
02:51:45 <Darius> Yes
02:52:14 <Darius> It's DeFunctionalization
02:52:19 <Marvin--> d'oh :)
02:52:19 <ski> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/DeFunctionalization
02:53:05 * Darius was too lazy to write it the other way (or rather find out what the other way is, presumably something like [Defunctionalization])
02:55:40 <Darius> Anyways, I was asking more to see if you were aware of it, than because I thought that taking app as primitive wouldn't be enough.  It may be useful later.
02:56:08 <Marvin--> yeah I've been looking at it as one way to handle HOF
02:56:50 <Marvin--> but this isn't supposed to be a gigantic project anyway, it's better to be able to do something with a tiny subset of haskell than not being able to do anything but with a large subset
02:56:51 <ski> using existentials for closure  is a kind of  Closure conversion, right ?
02:57:23 * Marvin-- tries to figure out why Eprover prefers to figure out all the things that are different from 0 rather than trying to figure out the *conjecture*
02:57:52 <Marvin--> apparently it figured out that 10*10*10 is, in fact, not smaller than 1
02:57:53 <Marvin--> bravo
03:01:26 <ski> heh
03:05:51 <Igloo> At least it hasn't proved the converse
03:06:32 <Marvin--> I wish it would spend more time on the conjecture rather than proving that lots of things are not equal to 0 :)
03:07:08 <ski> what is the conjecture ?
03:07:14 <Igloo> Well, one easy way to write that sort of thing would be enumerate theorems in a breadth-first-search way until you hit C or not C  :-)
03:07:50 <ibid> it might not terminate :)
03:08:20 <ibid> (well, nothing is guaranteed to terminate in ar)
03:08:28 <Igloo> I'm sure that's true of any theorem prover (except one that randomly decides to stop)
03:08:44 <ibid> as i said :)
03:09:37 <Marvin--> ski: it's a program that solves a summation puzzle, but with a clever bug that I want my program to find
03:09:39 <ibid> btw, there is a theorem that says, iirc, that it is not possible to write a computer program that enumerates all theorems
03:09:43 <Marvin--> so the conjecture is that the algorithm is sound
03:09:46 <Marvin--> (which it isn't)
03:11:46 <Igloo> I meant all theorems it knows how to derive
03:13:04 <Marvin--> I have no idea what the inner black magic of Eprover is, and I don't want to know :)
03:22:48 <Marvin--> I wonder if I should admit that working with numbers is just too complex at this stage and try to figure out other examples instead :-(
03:23:57 <Igloo> :-(
03:24:16 <Marvin--> I think the problem is that the terms just grow way too fast
03:24:32 <Marvin--> (which is a problem I will have to solve eventually anyway when working with the 'app' stuff)
03:24:54 <Marvin--> but trying to figure out how to set the term size of a function to 0 with Eprover might prove interesting
04:32:32 <xkb> Hi.. Do you guys know any good librarys for Haskell so I can calculate with Date's?
04:38:07 <elmex> ?
04:38:45 <elmex> write a C to Haskell linkage for the perl and use Time::Date or something ;-)))
04:39:27 <elmex> (one of the worst possible solutions of course;)
04:39:37 <xkb> lol
04:39:43 <xkb> I thought of that 2
04:39:51 <elmex> omg
04:39:55 <xkb> but it seems to much trouble :D
04:40:08 <elmex> fiddling with the perl API is trouble indeed ;))
04:40:32 <elmex> but writing modules in haskell for Perl would be quite cool
04:42:45 <ski> hmm, does the Time module in ghc contain a Date type ?
04:43:16 <ski> why doesn't ghci have a :b(rowse) command ?  arrrgh
04:44:00 <elmex> because hugs is cooler ;)
04:44:45 <ski> but hugs doesn't (yet, i think) support the Time module  (the Time module is in the library standard, no ?)
04:46:08 <elmex> ?
04:46:15 <ski> ??
04:46:19 <ski> what ?
04:46:30 <elmex> why?
04:46:37 <ski> why what ?
04:46:59 <elmex> dunno
04:47:50 <Darius> ski: GHCi does have a :browse command, though it's a little different from Hugs I think.
04:48:30 <ski> version 5.02.2 doesn't seem to have it
04:48:55 <ski> :Prelude> :browse
04:48:55 <ski> unknown command `:browse'
04:48:55 <ski> use :? for help.
04:48:55 <ski> Prelude> :b
04:48:55 <ski> unknown command `:b'
04:48:55 <ski> use :? for help.
04:49:05 <elmex> :?
04:49:14 <elmex> :-?
04:49:15 <Darius> I'm not sure when it was added, 5.04.2 definitely does.
04:49:57 <ski> ok
05:47:31 <shapr> y0
05:47:45 <shapr> hi magr
05:48:02 <magr> hello
05:48:30 <shapr> I think you've been here before, so I won't give you the intro speech :-)
05:48:58 <magr> I don't think so, but maybe I forgot.
05:49:01 <shapr> oh
05:49:02 <shapr> well then
05:49:16 <magr> I just found a pointer to this place on the Haskell Wiki
05:49:18 <shapr> welcome to #haskell, the irc channel where dysfunctional programming doesn't have a place...
05:49:34 <shapr> handy stuff is the Wiki (which you already found)
05:49:38 <shapr> the 'bot named lambdabot 
05:49:40 <shapr> @yow
05:49:40 <lambdabot> This TOPS OFF my partygoing experience!  Someone I DON'T LIKE
05:49:40 <lambdabot>  is talking to me about a HEART-WARMING European film..
05:49:47 <shapr> @type (>>=)
05:49:47 <lambdabot> (>>=) :: Monad a => a b -> (b -> a c) -> a c
05:49:56 <shapr> and lots of cool people
05:49:58 <andersca> hej shapr
05:50:04 <shapr> hej andersca, hur √§r det med dig?
05:50:39 <shapr> magr: the url to the channel logs can be found in the topic
05:50:47 <shapr> are you learning Haskell? or looking for other users?
05:51:15 <magr> I'm doing some programming language research right now
05:51:28 <magr> and looking into Haskell seems rewarding
05:52:17 <shapr> do you have any specific questions?
05:52:37 <magr> I learnt functional programming the *strict* way, and I'm right now trying to understand all that monad and lazyness stuff
05:55:49 <magr> from reading the wiki, the haskell community seems to be friendly folks
05:56:03 <andersca> yeah, we're very pure
05:56:05 <andersca> and lazy
05:57:00 <magr> lazyness is something i can identify with---but not yet program :)
05:59:09 <magr> hey, it seems I already earned the blue belt
05:59:22 <shapr> cool!
05:59:52 <magr> but actually, I think IO is easier than using type classes
06:02:29 <shapr> wow
06:02:42 <shapr> gutentag igen galority 
06:03:02 * shapr realizes there was some swedish in that german
06:06:08 <elmex> shapr: you are not germanski!
06:08:34 <elmex> parrot it, yay
06:08:41 <elmex> i like parrots
06:08:44 <elmex> they are sooo ocute ;)
06:08:47 * shapr wants a cracker
06:09:07 * elmex gives shapr a cracker
06:09:28 * ski says  mors pottsork
06:10:07 <magr> so, feierarbend.  See you.
06:10:15 <elmex> http://www.plif.com/archive/wc090.gif
06:10:34 <shapr> heh
06:33:18 <Igloo> Wow, http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~sseefried/seafood/photos/people/people-Pages/Image8.html is on the first page of google hits for my name
06:34:05 <shapr> you're famous!
06:34:36 <shapr> I suspect I weigh more than you do.
06:35:23 <Igloo> I think you might be right
06:35:57 <Marvin--> heh, the first google hit on my name is my AM report :-/
06:36:20 <Marvin--> lots of Debian stuff
06:36:25 <Igloo> Mine is my comlab page, which is probably about the most sensible thing it could be these days
06:36:29 <shapr> my homepage is the first hit for my name.. too bad I haven't updated in many years.
06:36:58 <Marvin--> the first eight google hits for "Martin Sj√∂gren" refers to me, the ninth and tenth to another Martin Sj√∂gren, in Stockholm :P
06:37:30 <andersca> third google hit for "anders carlsson" is me
06:37:37 <shapr> today in swedish class our new teacher asked me if Shae Erisson was a common USA name...
06:37:42 * Marvin-- boggles at http://www.battle.net/war3/images/other/seals.jpg
06:37:48 <Marvin--> shapr: heh
06:37:52 <Heffalump> last time I looked, all the top 100 google hits for Ganesh Sittampalam were me
06:38:00 <Heffalump> I like my name :-)
06:38:20 <shapr> Marvin--: someone bought a very large number of critter items and sent a horde out to scout
06:38:22 <Marvin--> hands up anybody who's surprised at the results :P
06:38:27 <Marvin--> shapr: yeah
06:38:28 <shapr> me me!
06:38:31 <shapr> I'm surprised!
06:38:51 <shapr> wait, what am I being surprised about?
06:39:04 <Marvin--> googling for Ganesh Sittampalam
06:39:06 <shapr> oh
06:39:07 * Igloo doesn't think I can be bothered to check my first 100  :-)
06:39:11 <shapr> I do that all the time, don't you?
06:39:27 <mgoetze> wth is Ganesh Sittampalam
06:39:35 <shapr> gru√ügott mgoetze 
06:39:43 <shapr> mgoetze: that's Heffalump's name.
06:39:44 <mgoetze> hi shae
06:39:48 <mgoetze> oh
06:39:48 <shapr> his other name
06:39:57 <earthy> okay, I have the top 5 google pages for my name
06:40:05 <shapr> you know, the fake one he uses for teachers and stuff.
06:40:34 <mgoetze> i used to have pretty much the top 50 google hits for my name
06:40:36 <Heffalump> and in real life in general :-p
06:40:40 <shapr> oh that too?
06:40:50 <mgoetze> but now that broadband is creeping around germany... *sigh*
06:41:17 <shapr> I doubt there will be another Shae Erisson anytime soon.
06:41:21 <shapr> but I could be wrong.
06:41:24 <shapr> hi Tomasso 
06:41:43 <shapr> hi harsha123 
06:41:47 <Tomasso> Hellooooo
06:42:08 <harsha123> shapr: hi
06:42:08 <shapr> hellooo nurse!
06:42:22 <Tomasso> is there a chat room on computer science ?
06:42:23 <shapr> harsha123: learning haskell?
06:42:42 * Igloo gives up after the 150th hit for Igloo
06:42:43 <harsha123> shapr: nopes.. i am here for some Comp. Sc.
06:42:49 <shapr> oh
06:42:56 <harsha123> shapr: and you
06:43:01 <shapr> what?
06:43:02 <shapr> for me?
06:43:04 <Tomasso> hehe
06:43:10 <shapr> I'm famous!
06:43:21 <harsha123> shapr: another linux ? ;)
06:43:27 <shapr> huh?
06:43:28 <harsha123> shapr: another linus ? ;)
06:43:31 <shapr> oh
06:43:43 <shapr> I'm only famous in a very small part of the world
06:43:47 <shapr> namely, my room.
06:43:58 <harsha123> shapr: then you must be a haskell expert.. 
06:44:04 <shapr> er.. um..
06:44:05 <shapr> kind of..
06:44:13 <harsha123> shapr: :)
06:44:43 <shapr> actually, I pretend to be an expert and I just ask Igloo and Heffalump questions in private messages when I don't know the answer.
06:44:55 <harsha123> shapr: are you good at Comp Sc ?
06:45:03 <Tomasso> when you have a language that is generated by a PDA (only 1 state, and recognizes by empty stack) and you translate its transitions to productions, and if you apply the pumping lemma, but doesnt work
06:45:13 <shapr> harsha123: I don't know.
06:45:16 <harsha123> shapr: then you are a really humble man.. or you are a cheat :)
06:45:18 <Tomasso> i cant use pumping lemma to show a language is regular
06:45:18 <shapr> harsha123: what sort of question do you have?
06:45:38 <harsha123> shapr: not right now.. maybe.. when I get one.. (will get a lot very soon)
06:46:13 <shapr> why will you get some soon?
06:46:17 <shapr> are you getting a CS degree?
06:46:22 <Tomasso> the language productions are not regular, but pumping lemma doesnt work
06:46:40 <harsha123> shapr: lol.. nopes.. need to study for an Advanced GRE.. CS
06:46:54 <shapr> that's a graduate placement exam, isn't it?
06:47:06 <harsha123> shapr: its been almost an year..i finished with school
06:47:15 <earthy> tomasso: okay, I don't follow you. You have a Pushdown Automaton A, and a language recognized by A, L(A). Now, you're trying to prove what? That L(A) is regular?
06:47:28 <harsha123> shapr: nopes its a exam to apply for the Masters in the US
06:47:36 <shapr> oh, I'm hoping to start a CS degree soon, but I need a few more classes first....
06:47:49 <harsha123> shapr: masters? 
06:48:02 <shapr> no, I don't have any degree
06:48:06 <shapr> just years of interest behind me
06:48:12 <harsha123> shapr: ok
06:48:21 <harsha123> shapr: a true geek ?
06:48:27 <shapr> I think so
06:48:31 <Tomasso> earthy: yes, but i cant do that using pumping lemma, if i remove or add cycles, the string still belongs to the language
06:48:32 <harsha123> shapr:  :)
06:48:53 <shapr> Darius: hey, are you awake?
06:49:03 <Tomasso> and cant use pumping lemma to show a language is not type 3
06:49:14 <earthy> tomasso: then the language very much sounds regular, and you should be able to write it down as a regular expression.
06:49:31 <shapr> Darius: I want to understand type systems better, and I thought I'd take your route... write a lambda cal interpreter, then simply typed lambda cal, then polymorphically typed lambda cal...
06:49:34 <shapr> Darius: what do you recommend?
06:49:40 <earthy> type 1 being finite and type 2 being regular?
06:49:44 <shapr> harsha123: what sort of bachelors degree do you have?
06:50:03 <harsha123> in Computer Sc
06:50:05 <shapr> oh
06:50:05 <Tomasso> earthy: then if i can represent the language as a regular expression its regular!!
06:50:06 <shapr> cool
06:50:21 <earthy> tomasso: yeah... obviously. :)
06:50:26 <harsha123> shapr: nothing cool.. i dont remember anything...
06:50:27 <Tomasso> hehehe
06:50:29 <shapr> I'd like to get a degree. School is free in Sweden, but I have to know the language well enough to take classes first.
06:50:35 <Tomasso> i didnt come to my mind :D
06:50:38 <adept> Tomasso: jfyi: http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~mairson/poems/node1.html :))
06:50:45 <shapr> harsha123: I'm actually from Alabama.
06:50:48 <Tomasso> le me check
06:50:57 <Darius> shapr: I don't think I've made a simply typed inferencer for the standard LC, but that would be trivial.
06:51:00 <harsha123> shapr: Ok.. sweet home alabama ?
06:51:09 <shapr> yah, it's a nice place to live.
06:51:14 <harsha123> shapr: :)
06:51:48 <shapr> Darius: do you think that's a good route for understanding type systems better?
06:52:03 <Tomasso> and one more thing, when you translate from the transitions of the PDA to productions, and the productions generate more things than the transitions... what can i do?
06:52:03 <Heffalump> shapr: are you a EU citizen?
06:52:04 <shapr> I'd like to work my way up to a thorough understanding of System F and the various extensions.
06:52:07 <shapr> Heffalump: nope
06:52:11 <Tomasso> i like computer science :D
06:52:13 <Heffalump> are you sure it'd be free, then?
06:52:16 <earthy> adept: I think he knew that. point is that the pumping lemma can only show a language is *not* regular. ;)
06:52:23 <Lunar^> shapr: Understand type system is like mystic
06:52:23 <Tomasso> its funnier than math but its math
06:52:36 <adept> earthy: yes, i follow. Just found that funny :)
06:52:39 <Lunar^> shapr: You don't know when you have revelations
06:52:42 <harsha123> Tomasso: are you good at finite automata ?:)
06:52:43 <earthy> yeah, the poem is nice. ;)
06:52:52 <shapr> Lunar^: hah
06:53:11 <adept> Tomasso: how comes that you have productions generate more things  .... ? /me is being dense today
06:53:15 * earthy has a feeling that he should knowSystem FF but doesn't...
06:53:16 <Tomasso> harsha123: heheh im in my second year of a degree in computer science
06:53:27 <Tomasso> ill be better :D
06:53:34 <earthy> adept: stack in the Pushdown Automaton
06:53:35 <harsha123> Tomasso: .. so what does that imply :)
06:53:38 * adept want to get back to the second year on uni ...
06:53:40 <shapr> from what I've heard, System F is the polymorphically typed lambda calculus
06:53:45 <shapr> but I'm not sure if that's correct
06:53:50 <adept> earthy: thanks!
06:54:01 <Lunar^> shapr: Anyway, writing an interpreter with an Hindley-Mindler typesystem is not really hard
06:54:03 <shapr> maybe it's a specific instance of PTLC
06:54:12 <Heffalump> System F is LC with explicit type arguments
06:54:16 <shapr> ah
06:54:19 <Darius> shapr:  The hardest part of implementing a HM-like type system is implementing unification, and you could use a logic language and get that for free.
06:54:20 <Lunar^> shapr: I learned a lot doing this
06:54:23 <Heffalump> s/LC/polymorphic LC/
06:54:27 <earthy> heffalump: *ah*, okay, that I can grok. ;)
06:54:36 <Heffalump> HM is polymorphic LC with implicit types (cos you can do inference)
06:54:36 <Tomasso> adept: productions generate more things let have an example:
06:54:46 <harsha123> what time does this room start kicking ?
06:54:49 <adept> Tomasso: what kind of PDA do you have?
06:54:53 <earthy> what variant of polymorphic LC? L2? or higher order?
06:54:55 <harsha123> i've been waiting all day long.. 
06:54:55 * Heffalump has a Palm
06:55:04 <adept> harsha123: 9:00 EET :)
06:55:06 <Tomasso> a one state pda that recognized by empty stack
06:55:14 <Darius> When people in Europe ish are awake mostly
06:55:21 <Heffalump> earthy: what do you mean by L2?
06:55:24 <harsha123> adept: EET ?? European time?
06:55:25 <adept> Tomasso: deterministic?
06:55:30 <adept> harsha123: exactly
06:55:36 * Heffalump likes his PDA
06:55:36 <harsha123> adept: ok..
06:55:36 <shapr> EET == eastern european time
06:55:42 <earthy> heffalump: do you know Barendregt's lambda cube?
06:55:49 <harsha123> <<< lives in India
06:55:50 <Tomasso> adept: yes
06:55:53 <adept> Heffalump: you have wrong PDA :) It could have more that one stack :)
06:55:55 <Heffalump> earthy: sort of, I don't remember it properly
06:55:58 <shapr> <<< lives in Sweden
06:56:36 <harsha123> Europe.. a hackers/geek's haven ? ;)
06:56:42 <Tomasso> adept: true, and when the first stack gets empty the string belongs to the language
06:56:51 <earthy> well, l2 is typed lambdacalculus with forall-quantifiers at the typelevel, so that \x:a.x : \forall a.a -> a
06:56:55 <earthy> (IIRC)
06:57:25 <Heffalump> can they occur anywhere in a type signature?
06:57:36 <earthy> not really, no, not in L2
06:57:41 <harsha123> hey.. guys how do i get my name in color ? I use X-chat
06:57:43 <Heffalump> HM forces them to be on the outside.
06:57:51 <Heffalump> so you can't have any in negative position
06:58:03 * Darius lives in America but just doesn't sleep.
06:58:07 <shapr> hah
06:58:14 <shapr> sleep is for the weak!
06:58:17 <shapr> like me...
06:58:22 <harsha123> hail Darius
06:58:30 * shapr throws small bits of ice
06:59:00 <Tomasso> transitions = {';'\B->b ';'\C->C '['\C->CC '['\B->CB '1'\X->X '0'\X->X ','\C->C ']'\C->lamda}
06:59:00 * Darius ows.
06:59:24 <harsha123> shapr: what chat client are you on?
06:59:29 <shapr> I use ERC.
06:59:36 <shapr> Darius: you've been hailed ;-)
06:59:41 <harsha123> ERC.. windows?
06:59:44 <earthy> darius: ah, but it is almost 9am at the *west* coast already, so you could just be up already.
06:59:52 <adept> harsha123: emacs :)
06:59:54 <shapr> harsha123: emacs runs on nearly anything.
07:00:17 <harsha123> does emacs have a chat chlent ??
07:00:21 <earthy> (owh, damn, my calculations are off by one)
07:00:29 <harsha123> <<<< never knew this :(
07:00:35 <shapr> I like emacs.
07:00:43 <harsha123> any guide .. tutorils guys? to run ERC ? :)
07:00:48 <Tomasso> productions = {B->';'B C->;C C->'['CC B->'['CB X->'1'X X->'0'X X->','X C->']'}
07:00:48 <shapr> sure
07:00:50 * shapr gets url
07:01:02 <harsha123> <<< heard a lots about emacs.. and wants to badly use it
07:01:05 <Darius> earthy: but it was 3am, when I asked shapr what he would do if his house was on fire.
07:01:22 <shapr> harsha123: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/EmacsIRCClient
07:01:26 <shapr> emacs is cool.
07:01:40 <shapr> it has its warts, like anything.
07:02:01 <shapr> if you haven't learned emacs yet, you may want to start there, and then try ERC after.
07:02:05 <andersca> jag har en emacswiki-tshirt
07:02:10 <Tomasso> where X belongs to  { ['[' ']' ',' '0' '1' ';' }
07:02:14 <earthy> darius: so? you sleep 5 hours a night. I do that.
07:02:21 <shapr> andersca: det √§r j√§ttekul.
07:02:30 <adept> Tomasso: hmm ...
07:02:42 <Tomasso> the productions generate more things
07:02:54 <Tomasso> like ;;;B
07:02:58 <shapr> I'd like to try polyrhythm sleep.
07:03:15 <harsha123> shapr: the link doesnt work :(
07:03:16 <Tomasso> [0,1,0,1];[0,1] belongs to the language L(A)
07:03:31 <shapr> harsha123: it works for me...
07:03:34 <shapr> what error do you get?
07:03:42 <harsha123> << will try agin
07:04:04 <Tomasso> c++ should use polimorfism and not those awfull templates
07:04:06 <Tomasso> :D
07:04:11 <harsha123> shapr: works now
07:04:15 <shapr> yay
07:04:22 <harsha123> no beer

07:04:53 <harsha123> hehehehe..
07:04:58 <harsha123> shapr: good one
07:05:11 <Darius> templates are (parametric) polymorphism.
07:05:22 <shapr> harsha123: Haskell is good for Computer Science stuff. Have you tried a functional language before?
07:06:03 <Tomasso> hmh yes
07:06:05 <harsha123> shapr: no.. none. C C++ and bash
07:06:09 <harsha123> shapr: some perl
07:06:24 <shapr> oboy
07:06:33 <shapr> I'd recommend you learn Python and Haskell.
07:06:45 <harsha123> shapr: Ok..python.. yes..
07:06:46 <Darius> Well, then shapr's (earlier) advice is especially true.
07:06:53 <harsha123> shapr: i wanna learn python..
07:06:57 <Rafterman> shapr: right on
07:07:00 <shapr> python is good. Haskell is also good.
07:07:04 <Marvin--> you want to learn haskell too
07:07:07 <shapr> yes yes
07:07:13 <harsha123> shapr: do ya alwys hang out here?
07:07:15 <shapr> of course, you may receive biased advice from #haskell.
07:07:18 <shapr> harsha123: often.
07:07:21 * Marvin-- pulls out his pendulum and swings it in front of harsha123's eyes
07:07:24 <Marvin--> you want to learn haskell
07:07:26 * shapr laughs
07:07:45 <harsha123> shapr: brb
07:07:56 <shapr> harsha123: I can give you long detailed reasons for learning Python and Haskell now that you know C and C++
07:08:04 <shapr> but none of them will help you with GREs
07:08:07 <harsha123> shapr: sure.. i am ready to har..
07:08:11 <harsha123> shapr: sure.. i am ready to hare
07:08:16 <harsha123> shapr: dont mind..
07:08:27 <earthy> GREs are just filling your mind with almost useless info
07:08:31 <harsha123> shapr: dont mind,even if it does not help me in my GRE ;)
07:08:41 <shapr> in short, high level (and especially functional) languages let you write about the goal more than the steps to take to get there.
07:08:59 * ski|afk has been afk for some time now, really ..
07:09:21 <shapr> ski|afk: hah! you said that, so we know you were there!

07:10:19 <harsha123> omg..
07:10:22 <shapr> what?
07:10:42 <harsha123> Hmm....thats..
07:10:51 <shapr> ?
07:10:57 <harsha123> hmm..
07:11:03 <shapr> c'mon, you have a CS degree, right? :-)
07:11:09 <harsha123> hehehe..

07:16:10 <yazirian> yes?
07:16:47 <shapr> hi Dan Dillinger!
07:16:51 <yazirian> hi!
07:16:57 <shapr> nice to meet you in real-time.
07:17:13 <yazirian> I exist! Yay!
07:17:15 <shapr> yay!
07:17:35 <shapr> I've seen you on livejournal lots...
07:17:59 <yazirian> your comment's how I got here 
07:18:03 <shapr> oh
07:18:06 <shapr> wow :-)
07:18:16 <shapr> I'M FAMOUS!
07:18:23 <yazirian> woo!
07:18:30 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: yr not on #javapro
07:18:33 * shapr bounces cheerfully
07:18:38 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: that's true, I'm not.
07:18:43 <shapr> but I could be...
07:19:01 <shapr> I do have some Java work coming up soon :-/
07:19:23 <shapr> yazirian: soooo, do you use Haskell?
07:19:52 <yazirian> I would say, poke and prod at Haskell
07:20:04 <yazirian> it is a reticent beast :-)
07:20:19 <shapr> it can be, I agree.
07:20:37 <shapr> it is loathe to reveal it's innermost secrets to the uninitiated.
07:20:51 <shapr> btw, we had a great initiation party in Uppsala.
07:20:54 <yazirian> yeah, and my astrolabe is on the fritz, so
07:20:58 <shapr> oh that sucks.
07:21:20 <shapr> is it running windows? ;-)
07:21:34 <yazirian> 3.11 for workgroups
07:21:36 <shapr> yow!
07:21:46 <shapr> also known as windows for warehouses at the time
07:23:10 <yazirian> my black belt is in python, actually
07:23:27 <yazirian> but it lacks folds
07:23:36 <yazirian> so I guess I donno how old you are either
07:23:37 <shapr> there are at least two folds in Haskell.
07:23:40 * shapr laughs
07:23:45 <andersca> rrrrrr!!!
07:23:46 <andersca> Avast!
07:23:54 <earthy> no, anders, you're 8 days early.
07:23:55 <Rafterman> ahoy!
07:24:18 <shapr> I think I have a black belt in Python.
07:24:38 <earthy> I do not want a black belt in python
07:24:46 <shapr> it's a nice language.
07:24:50 <yazirian> I like it much
07:24:55 <shapr> me too.
07:24:55 <yazirian> I get paid to write Java
07:25:00 <yazirian> so I like it much much
07:25:04 <shapr> have you used Jython?
07:25:08 <earthy> the experience of writing a 3k-line multithreaded GUI in it was quite enough to turn me off of Python
07:25:10 <yazirian> yes
07:25:51 * adept thinks that python is always one feature late, one method short ;)
07:25:58 <earthy> well, not completely off of Python, but it makes me think at least three times before using it again
07:26:08 <shapr> everyone should use whatever fits their head
07:26:55 <yazirian> which toolkit?
07:27:26 <earthy> my brain fits my head. :)
07:28:22 <earthy> yazirian: GTK
07:28:23 <Igloo> Mine's like a square peg in a round hole
07:28:56 <Heffalump> a very small square peg in a very large round hole?
07:30:12 <harsha123> <<< is back..
07:30:29 <harsha123> <<<feels that he has to improve his computational skills :((
07:30:44 <andersca> harsha123: and you can use /me instead of <<<
07:30:56 <yazirian> GUI programming makes the soul weep :)
07:30:59 <harsha123> andersca: Ok. ty
07:31:12 * harsha123 is great ;)
07:31:36 <harsha123> andersca: how did ya get your name in color?
07:31:56 <andersca> harsha123: that's so you see that someone is talking to you
07:32:28 <harsha123> andersca: how did ya get that in color :)
07:32:37 <andersca> it's when someone writes your nick
07:32:47 <adept> followed by colon
07:32:55 <andersca> adept: not necessarily
07:33:05 <adept> andersca: but often :)
07:33:24 <adept> quake3
07:33:25 <earthy> so, if I were to call harsha123 by his nick, my name would be highligted?
07:33:34 <adept> damn. wrong window (again).
07:33:44 <shapr> earthy: if he's using the X-Chat client, yes.
07:34:24 <harsha123> andersca: what client are you using?
07:34:40 <andersca> harsha123: xchat
07:34:43 <yazirian> most clients do that
07:34:51 <yazirian> I am on irssi, and it does that too
07:35:15 * harsha123 finds irssi difficult..
07:35:23 * harsha123 has to get used to it.
07:35:34 <yazirian> I like it 'cause it runs under screen.
07:35:50 <harsha123> so no tabs.. :)
07:35:54 <yazirian> So I just start screen at home, and then wherever I am, I just ssh there.
07:36:07 <yazirian> You will never know when I am commuting, except I get quiet for 20 mins ;)
07:37:08 <earthy> my ircII does it, but only because I made it do it with a script. ;)
08:00:18 <earthy> numlist :: TblList
08:00:25 <earthy> numlist = [ ("one",1),
08:00:55 <earthy>             ("two",2),
08:00:59 <earthy> and so on
08:01:05 <earthy> (wce)
08:04:23 <Darius> ?
08:04:35 <earthy> darius: layout rule. :)
08:06:03 * Darius is still confused. What brought it up?
08:06:30 <earthy> darius: discussion in privmsg's, and i forgot to /query
08:06:53 <earthy> the idea is to do something like:
08:06:53 <earthy> Main> stringtonum "three million five hundred thirty three thousand seven hundred twelve"    
08:06:53 <earthy> 3533712
08:07:22 <ski_> yay !
08:07:41 <ski_> xchat seems to work here, now
08:08:38 <Darius> that professor hasn't checked the homework yet?
08:19:38 <ski> (seems xchat crashed the login session or something ..)
08:20:38 <mgoetze> earthy: but will it also recognize "seven hundred and twelve"? :)
08:21:58 <earthy> mgoetze: not *yet* ;)
08:22:36 <earthy> and it will not function with dutch: vijf en vijftig (which is fifty five) doesn't translate (even if I put in the right word -> value mappign)
08:23:46 <mgoetze> sure, but then dutch (like german ;) ) has it the wrong way around ;)
08:24:26 <earthy> no it doesn't! :)
08:24:45 <earthy> it just has it the other way around
08:25:00 <yazirian> your chocolate is in my peanut butter!
08:25:09 * shapr snickers
08:25:16 <shapr> yazirian: you must be a child of the 80s
08:25:21 <mgoetze> and i doubt it will be able to parse "einundzwanzig" anytime soon...
08:25:26 <ski> is dutch big-endian, small-endian, or mixed-endian ?
08:25:35 * mgoetze takes snickers away from shapr and eats it
08:25:40 <yazirian> I was indeed a person of youth in that particular decade.
08:25:47 * shapr still has a Mars bar.
08:25:59 <yazirian> wash it down with some Tab
08:26:03 <mgoetze> sure, you can keep it, as long as it's not mars almond
08:26:08 <shapr> just one calorie... now you see it, now you don't.
08:26:28 <yazirian> I was right in the middle of a Caramello when I found gold.
08:26:46 <shapr> butter.... parquet...
08:27:05 <shapr> Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?
08:27:14 <mgoetze> i hate ebay... you always have to wait days before you find out whether you can win an auction or not :(
08:27:26 <Smerdyakov> No
08:27:34 <Smerdyakov> You can just bid on auctions about to end.
08:27:59 <mgoetze> sure, but i'll be seeing that the auctions exist days before
08:28:43 <mgoetze> i wouldn't bid on them with 6 days left anyway, due to psychological effects on other ebayers, but i'll certainly be watching, and watching and wa... you know
08:29:19 <CowGirl> mgoetze, u ever bidded against someone in the very last minutes??
08:29:36 <mgoetze> and most of the time, you have no idea how much other people are going to bid until a few minutes before the end
08:30:09 <mgoetze> CowGirl: i've used a sniping program once, but i think mostly it's good enough to bid manually half an hour before the end...
08:30:49 <CowGirl> but u always get that one person who outbids u with like 30 seconds to go!!
08:31:23 <mgoetze> well, if he's going to outbid you, he's going to outbid you, whether he does it 30 seconds or 30 hours before...
08:31:41 <yazirian> awp camper!!!11!1!!!
08:31:49 <yazirian> hehe
08:31:51 <mgoetze> you just have to be sure to actually bid as much as you are willing to pay, and not less
08:32:34 <mgoetze> what really sucks is similar articles ending within a few minutes of each other, or one of them having buy it now and the other not
08:32:54 <CowGirl> but i have found, even if i put in a large bid ...say with 6 days left...that people will pay more....if there is a multiple number of the same items available...if u just hold off bidding to the end...it keeps the price down
08:33:13 <whee> woo that's painful to read
08:33:25 <ski> not at all
08:34:16 <mgoetze> e.g. i bid 50 eur on a terratec maestro + yamaha db50xg, with just a db50xg available as buy it now for 39 eur... well i lost that auction (two snipers!) but of course by then someone else had grabbed the yamaha alone
08:35:18 <CowGirl> did u bid on both at the same time?? do u risk that?
08:36:10 <mgoetze> nah... i would have grabbed it as buy it now normally...
08:37:09 <CowGirl> well as usual.....another one always comes along with a better price...
08:37:40 <CowGirl> and had u bought it earlier....u would have kicked urself when a few weeks later...theres one for a better deal
08:38:21 <mgoetze> sure, i'll get a db50xg sooner or later... not so sure about a certain other soundcard i'm bidding on right now... :)
08:38:28 <shapr> yazirian: I stopped playing the game with the awp.
08:38:37 <shapr> plus it's really an awm.
08:38:55 <whee> I still play CS when I'm bored, waiting for HL2 :\
08:39:30 <shapr> I gave up on CS, far too many cheaters.
08:39:46 <whee> it's a lot better with 1.6, there's basically none
08:39:59 <shapr> I realized that 75% of the best players stopped playing for awhile when the next version would be released.
08:40:35 <CowGirl> just out of curiosity...i just have a laptop,.....so cant do much about sound.....whats the point of a good sound card??
08:41:08 <mgoetze> uhm, in my case, i compose music and can't afford to pay an orchestra to play it for me...
08:41:12 <CowGirl> i mean i just hooked up some decent external speaks to my laptop, hung them on my wall, and its got some pretty damn good sound.
08:41:35 <mgoetze> sure, anything will do for playing back WAV data nowadays
08:41:45 <mgoetze> basically what i need are the samples/presets
08:42:06 <CowGirl> i use my speakers just to play Mp3s and watch VCDs...and its really good, i also plug the speakers into the TV
08:42:18 <mgoetze> i also have a roland xv-2020, which is basically a keyboard without a keyboard...
08:42:35 <CowGirl> but for a good sound card, im guessing u need some pretty good speakers to complement it?
08:42:47 <shapr> or good headphones
08:43:10 <shapr> I want some SPDIF headphones, but I don't think they exist.
08:43:25 <mgoetze> it all goes through my yamaha mg 10/2 mixing console and off to my stereo system :)
08:43:45 <Lunar^> shapr: You'd need a DAC in the headphones..
08:44:24 <shapr> Lunar^: yes, that's why I want them :-)
08:44:33 <shapr> I want digital up to the eardrum
08:45:56 <Verbed> I've just finished implementing the metaphone algorithm in... Python.
08:46:32 <hdaume> hi all
08:46:34 <shapr> hi hal
08:46:43 <ski> hi
08:46:58 <hdaume> how goes it shae?
08:47:19 <mgoetze> well, my music is converted from digital to analogue 3 times by the time it reaches my speakers, and still sounds great... you just need decent DACs...
08:47:55 <shapr> hdaume: I'm stuffing my head full of swedish words, what's up with you?
08:48:33 <hdaume> not much...back at school :)
08:51:00 <yazirian> speaking of ebay (recently)... http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2950215207&category=1467
08:52:17 <mgoetze> hm, i can't cutnpaste from my terminal to my browser unfortunately :)
08:52:42 <mgoetze> wb shapr :)
08:52:59 <shapr> flashcard.el renamed my buffers some...
08:54:05 <CowGirl> yazirian :  u know that person?
08:54:25 <yazirian> heh, no
08:54:41 <CowGirl> how'd u come across that???
08:54:56 <CowGirl> i remember one guy tried to sell one of his kidneys
08:55:03 <mgoetze> the trick to ebay is finding the items other people don't... you know, when they're in the wrong category with a few typos in the title...
08:55:03 <yazirian> now that's desperate
08:55:13 <yazirian> ooo, lunchtime!
08:55:14 <CowGirl> i think it was up to $6 million!!
08:55:40 <CowGirl> but ebay took it off of course,  since u cant sell living things i think they said
08:56:03 <d33p> hey.. i have one of those!
08:56:13 <shapr> I have two.
08:56:51 <mgoetze> sell both and you'll be rich, shapr :)
08:57:10 <CowGirl> can u imagine if it was legal....how many people would do it...
08:57:21 <CowGirl> cause u'd get all the filthy rich folk buying organs
08:57:37 * Marvin-- wants a hammond organ...
08:57:42 <ski> not selling both kidneys, though ? :)
08:58:03 <mgoetze> Marvin--: i have a couple in my xv-2020... :)
08:58:41 <Marvin--> I like the guy who put up an iTunes song for sale on eBay
08:59:24 <mgoetze> the coolest thing about my xv-2020 was that after the auction, i got a 30 eur rebate because the seller couldn't find the usb cable (i happened to have one lying around, lol)
09:01:12 <CowGirl> iTunes??
09:01:14 <CowGirl> whats that?
09:02:49 <whee> Marvin: I don't see the point of selling a $1 item on ebay :)
09:03:28 <mgoetze> whee: you never know, someone might bid $10 for it... :)
09:03:37 <Marvin--> whee: trying out the right of first sale
09:10:26 <mgoetze> another thing i hate about ebay is that you can only observe 30 items...
09:10:47 <shapr> you could write a Haskell program to observe stuff anyway
09:12:36 <mgoetze> is there an ebay library for haskell?
09:12:45 <shapr> no, but you could write one.3
09:12:49 <shapr> there is an HTTP.hs
09:12:59 <shapr> and there's HaXML and HXMLToolbox
09:13:00 <mgoetze> nah, too much work :)
09:22:12 <mgoetze> now, someone tell me why the french horn sounds on the xv-2020 are such utter crap :/
09:51:02 <Igloo> hdaume: You have your -fno-th wish it seems  :-)
09:52:13 <hdaume> at this point it's pretty moot -- i've already "fixed" all my old code :)
09:52:37 <Igloo> Oh well, it's for the best anyway  :-)
09:52:47 <Marvin--> how are the flags parsed?
09:52:53 <hdaume> i agree
09:53:12 <hdaume> presumably left-to-right, as with the other flags
09:53:12 <Marvin--> I would prefer -fth=no or something like that, definitely not -fnoth... my mind parsed that as NOTHing
09:53:18 <hdaume> (or is that not what you meant?)
09:53:52 * Igloo has no idea, but -fno-th always beating -fglasgow-exts would make sense
09:53:57 <hdaume> but this way it parallels -fno-code, and the other -fno things (-fno-glasgow-exts)
09:54:34 <Marvin--> well, -fno-th is better than -fnoth :)
09:54:48 <hdaume> agreed :)
09:59:37 <Marvin--> Sweden's secretary of foreign affairs was stabbed in the stomach this afternoon :-/
10:00:12 <Marvin--> or is it called minister of foreign affairs?
10:00:35 <ski> he was ?
10:00:37 <andersca> I think it's called minister of FFI
10:00:44 <ski> didn't know that
10:01:17 <Marvin--> ski: you mean she, Anna Lindh
10:01:45 <ski> yes, i just remembered who it was ..
10:02:43 <ibid> does anybody besides the usa call their ministers secretaries?
10:03:00 <ibid> (and what is the point of calling the foreign relations dept the dept of state?)
10:06:28 <ski> hmm
10:07:01 <ski> should the empty list be considered a (consecutive) sublist of a list xs ?
10:07:25 <ski> what is most symmetric/beautiful ?
10:08:55 <ski> (like "cde" is a sublist of "abcdefgh")
10:09:49 <ibid> my instincts would say yes
10:12:22 <ski> a simple  map tails . inits  generates duplicate empty lists though ..
10:13:11 <ski> s/map/concatMap/
10:13:48 <Lor> Haskell strings are hideous.
10:14:39 <Lor> (Not that everyone wouldn't be aware of it already...)
10:14:59 <Marvin--> ski: and why not?
10:15:14 <ski> Marvin-- : why not what ?
10:15:32 <Marvin--> why shouldn't it generate duplicate empty lists?
10:15:59 <ski> well, i don't want it right now ;)
10:16:10 <Marvin--> then write your own versions of tails and inits
10:16:29 <Lor> Or use an idempotent set rather than lists.
10:16:35 <Lor> finitemap?
10:16:40 <Lor> Or does the order matter?
10:16:41 <ski> or a single function (which i am doing)
10:17:31 <ski> hmm, i'm not sure how much the order matters. it matters not for correctness
10:17:47 <Marvin--> there's also nub :P
10:17:52 <ski> i'm doing branch-and-bound algorithm
10:18:30 <ski> (or i will use this function for a such, at least)
10:20:20 <ski> hmm, i'm thinking maybe it is easier/clearer to make the recursive loop not return the empty list as a possible sublist, and just add it at the top, as an afterthought ..
10:51:11 <Tomasso> a regular expresion for strings of the form: [0,1,1,0,0];[0,1,1];[0,0,0,1] ??
10:51:15 <Tomasso> how would it be?
10:56:03 <Lor> There was talk about regular patterns at icfp.
10:56:26 <Tomasso> icfp ?
10:56:33 <esap> regular patterns?
10:56:40 * esap grins.
10:57:12 <Tomasso> im trying to write it... but not sure
10:57:35 <Lor> I-m not sure if it's online.
10:58:05 <Tomasso> R = ([.((0 + 1).(, + ]))*) i dunno what to do with the ;
11:07:36 <hdaume> if R is a regex for matching [0,1,1,0]-like things, then you just want R(;R)*, right?
11:16:36 <Tomasso> hmhm hdaume: whar do  you mean?
11:30:37 <hdaume> suppose we want to recognize things like a0b1b1b0cda0b0c (i've replaced [ with a, comma with b, ] with c and ; with d so the regex is readable
11:31:09 <hdaume> then, S=a(0|1)(b(0|1))*b recognizes each sublist
11:31:20 <hdaume> erg
11:31:31 <hdaume> S=a(0|1)(b(0|1))*c, rather
11:31:42 <hdaume> then R=S(dS)* recognizes what you want
11:33:54 <hdaume> where * is kleene star, | is alternation and EF means E followed by F
11:37:44 * ski has to go home now
11:38:02 <ski> bye
12:09:12 <Tomasso> hmhm
12:18:41 <Tomasso> hdaume, it works Thank you
14:29:30 <Xcalibor> hello :)
18:32:28 <Pseudonym> Damn, Galois is hiring.
18:32:35 <Pseudonym> Makes me almost wish I wanted to live in the US.
18:32:40 <Pseudonym> Almost. :-)
21:33:42 <Tomasso> gotta sleeep
21:33:48 <Tomasso> byeee friends
21:33:53 <Pseudonym> Night.
21:34:58 <Smerdyakov> You were too late.
21:35:04 <Smerdyakov> He'll resent you always.
21:47:01 <Pseudonym> Good.
21:47:07 <Pseudonym> Never liked him anyway.
22:05:32 <reffie> Galois?
22:05:45 <Smerdyakov> No.
22:06:01 <reffie> the dead mathematician?
22:06:15 <mgoetze> busy channel tonight :)
22:08:51 <Smerdyakov> They're all dead.
22:08:53 <Smerdyakov> Didn't you here?
22:08:56 <Smerdyakov> Oh no
22:08:57 <Smerdyakov> HEAR
22:09:01 <reffie> heh
22:10:08 <mgoetze> why worry about spelling mistakes when noone is watching anyhow? :)
22:10:56 <reffie> i am watching.
22:11:04 <Pseudonym> The dead mathematicians are watching.
22:11:10 <Pseudonym> They're telling me to... do things.
22:12:38 * Smerdyakov brings forth a draft resolution to forbid further specification of what the dead mathematicians are telling people to do.
22:14:29 <Pseudonym> Oh, they're just telling me to learn more about category theory.
22:14:47 <Pseudonym> Which one might think would be sinister enough.
22:16:09 <Smerdyakov> I wish we had passed the resolution. :\
22:16:30 <Pseudonym> One does not a quorum make.
22:18:53 <Smerdyakov> You are risking irrelevancy.
22:19:22 <Pseudonym> Maybe, but you just wait until you want a large amount of money and troops in three months time.  We'll see who's irrelevant then.
22:19:55 <Smerdyakov> I guess, but I bet we'll just forget, to be honest.
22:22:58 <mgoetze> i second the resolution
22:23:07 <Smerdyakov> Then there is still hope!
22:23:19 <Smerdyakov> I take preventing bad math jokes to be a moral imperative.
22:23:37 --- mode: mgoetze set +v Smerdyakov
22:23:41 <Pseudonym> One of these days, I'm going to arrest hdaume.
22:23:43 <mgoetze> here, have a soapbox :)
22:24:09 <Smerdyakov> I'm just going to modulate my voice so as to break glass.
22:24:18 <Smerdyakov> Since abusing authority is another moral imperative.
22:24:24 <Pseudonym> Absolutely!
22:24:34 <Pseudonym> Power corrupts, but absolute power is kinda nice.
22:24:38 <Smerdyakov> Now all the glass is broken.
22:24:43 <Smerdyakov> I'm going to sell it to gypsies.
22:24:49 <Pseudonym> As a matter of interest, what's +v?
22:24:53 * mgoetze considers random abuse of his ircop authority... hm... :)
22:24:57 <Smerdyakov> Very interesting
22:25:10 <Pseudonym> Really?  There's a "very interesting" flag?
22:25:17 <Pseudonym> Geez, why didn't we set it for Smerdy before?!
22:25:19 <Smerdyakov> I made that up. I'm sorry.
22:25:21 <mgoetze> actually, it means "voice"
22:25:36 <mgoetze> it's particularily useful in moderated channels
22:25:44 <Smerdyakov> You didn't set it before because the time wasn't right.
22:25:58 <Smerdyakov> Now the stars have aligned and it's time for the nonstop dance party of the century.
22:26:07 <Pseudonym> Woohoo!
22:26:14 --- mode: mgoetze set -v Smerdyakov
22:26:17 <mgoetze> i hate dancing :)
22:26:18 * Pseudonym puts on the Haskell Standard Prelude Extended Dance Mix
22:26:21 <Smerdyakov> It's an allegorical dance party.
22:26:30 <Smerdyakov> Instead of swaying, you have to use metaphors.
22:26:51 <mgoetze> dance music wastes about 20% of the presets on my synthesizers
22:27:32 <Smerdyakov> Presets and freshets and wigwams, oh my!
22:27:36 <Pseudonym> So does intellectual waivering count as allegorical dancing?
22:28:10 <Smerdyakov> I don't know. I'll have to break out my collection of 1980's allegorical dance party movies for some research.
22:28:11 * Pseudonym meant wavering
22:29:03 * mgoetze drafts, proposes, seconds and passes a resolution absolutely forbidding 1980's allegorical dance party movies
22:29:23 <Smerdyakov> Well, now we're awash in temporal paradoxes.
22:29:55 <Pseudonym> English grammar will be unable to cope with this.
22:29:57 <mgoetze> i hope you've got your surf board handy, Smerdyakov 
22:30:10 <mgoetze> the paradox waves are a wild ride
22:30:42 <Smerdyakov> No, I don't. My surfboard was created by the child of allegorical dance party movie stars who NEVER MET in our NEW DIVERGENT TIMELINE.
22:30:47 <harsha123> shapr: hi
22:31:18 <Pseudonym> shapr not here
22:31:18 <mgoetze> harsha123: at a random guess, shapr is still sleeping
22:31:29 <Smerdyakov> No problem. We'll simulate shapr with a beachball.
22:31:31 <Pseudonym> We can say anything we like about him!
22:31:34 <harsha123> mgoetze: hmm......Ok
22:32:04 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: They do bounce, but can they speak Swedish?
22:32:33 <Smerdyakov> No, but you can use them to play beach volleyball, at the beach.
22:32:50 * mgoetze serves shapr to Smerdyakov 
22:32:51 <Pseudonym> Wow.
22:32:54 <Pseudonym> What a good idea.
22:33:14 <Pseudonym> Hang on, is this allegorical beach volleyball?
22:33:31 <mgoetze> i didn't know you could play beach volleyball at the beach... i thought it was only playable at naturist resorts...
22:33:52 <Smerdyakov> I don't know, but if someone ever writes a capsule bio of me that ends with the statement "His agenda is unclear," my life will be complete.
22:33:55 <Pseudonym> mgoetze: It's an Olympic sport, now.
22:34:16 * Pseudonym makes a note to put that on Smerdyakov's tombstone
22:34:31 <mgoetze> nude athletes at the olympics? wow, maybe i should get a tv after all...
22:34:56 <Pseudonym> Actually, nude gladiatorial matches were part of the ancient olympics.
22:35:09 <mgoetze> yeah but they didn't have tv back then
22:35:25 <Pseudonym> True.  What better reason to get an amphora?
22:35:31 <Smerdyakov> mgoetze, now they did, thanks to your temporal paradox!
22:35:32 <mgoetze> not to mention that there weren't any women participating
22:36:35 * mgoetze sets the shapr volleyball to the temporal paradox which slam dunks shapr into a different time line
22:37:03 * Pseudonym notices an image of shapr on his amphora
22:37:04 <harsha123> why is mgoetze after shapr's ass :p
22:38:30 <Smerdyakov> What do you mean? THERE IS NO ONE CALLED SHAPR IN THIS TIMELINE.
22:39:06 <Pseudonym> Yes there is.  Just not yet.
22:39:33 <mgoetze> i married shapr's girlfriend in this timeline and we're planning to call our first son "shae"
22:39:35 <harsha123> Smerdyakov: no offence meant.. :)
22:40:04 <Smerdyakov> Dude, EVERYONE married shapr's girlfriend in one of those timelines.
22:40:05 <Pseudonym> For some reason, in this timeline I have a daughter named "Perl".
22:40:17 <Smerdyakov> She GETS AROUND.
22:41:02 <mgoetze> my personal favourite is the timeline where i married larry wall's daughter
22:41:24 <Pseudonym> Yes, I was at that ceremony.  Very pre-modernist.
22:41:52 <harsha123> can ya explain what the HELL are you guys talkin about..
22:42:02 <Pseudonym> harsha123: Not yet, no.
22:42:09 <harsha123> what the heck is a TIMELINE ?? whats the context atleast ?
22:42:15 <Pseudonym> History will have to be the judge.
22:42:39 <Smerdyakov> I like the episode where Larry Wall and Simon-Peyton Jones are teleported to the desert planet and have to learn to cooperate against the reptilians.
22:42:41 <harsha123> please guys be kind..
22:42:52 <mgoetze> yeah, it was really cool how we cloned j.s.bach and sent him to deep freeze just so we could wake him up to play organ at the wedding
22:42:55 <Smerdyakov> oops
22:43:01 <Smerdyakov> I guess hyphenation is different in that timeline.
22:43:25 <Pseudonym> Simon-Peyton Jones is Mark P. Jones' grandson in that timeline.
22:43:41 <mgoetze> harsha123: data Timeline a = Universe a
22:44:13 * harsha123 seeing stars..
22:44:59 * harsha123 says everything is deflectin off his head..
22:45:12 <Pseudonym> Lucky you wore the tinfoil hat.
22:45:21 <Pseudonym> Wise move, I think.
22:45:43 <mgoetze> yeah, especially considering what happened in the timeline where you wore a baseball cap instead
22:45:56 <harsha123> hmm....
22:46:20 <Pseudonym> The Haskell-powered Orbital Mind Control Lasers are always a danger in this timeline.
22:55:17 <harsha123> hmm where are ya guys now ?
23:12:12 <mgoetze> harsha123: i'm in timeline #23
23:26:06 <shapr> I'm in timeline #42
23:35:42 <Lor> Useless trivia: #42 is the oldest irc channel in existence.
23:41:26 <Pseudonym> Ye gods!  A talking beach ball!
23:42:38 <d33p> @yow
23:42:39 <lambdabot> Well, O.K.  I'll compromise with my principles because of
23:42:39 <lambdabot>  EXISTENTIAL DESPAIR!
23:52:04 <shapr> @yow
23:52:05 <lambdabot> Your CHEEKS sit like twin NECTARINES above a MOUTH that knows no BOUNDS --
23:52:24 <shapr> Pseudonym: beach beach beach, that's all I ever hear.
23:52:35 <shapr> goood morning #haskell!
23:55:39 <Pseudonym> Quite some greeting you got there.
