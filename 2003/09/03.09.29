01:31:18 <phubuh> hi hi
01:31:25 <phubuh> god these classes are so boring
01:32:03 <Heffalump> morning all
01:34:20 <shapr> y0
01:36:31 <phubuh> morning
01:36:54 <shapr> good moron!
01:36:59 <phubuh> thanks!
01:37:26 <phubuh> gah, why can't acrobat reader read postscript :<
01:40:18 <vegai> cause it si teh suk?
01:40:32 <phubuh> probably
01:40:38 <phubuh> heck, it can't even read pdfs properly
01:40:48 <vegai> you on windows?
01:41:17 <vegai> if not, xpdf is nice
01:41:33 <phubuh> unfortunately, i am
01:41:36 <phubuh> i'm at school :/
01:41:41 <vegai> ohh, damn
01:41:43 <vegai> no ghostview?
01:41:51 <phubuh> i use gnome 2.4's pdf viewer at home :)
01:41:51 <phubuh> nope
01:42:09 <phubuh> oh well, some of these papers are available in pdf
01:52:52 <Darius> phubuh: You may want to see http://wheel.compose.cs.cmu.edu:8001/cgi-bin/browse/objweb which I came across looking for interesting papers.
02:09:30 <phubuh> Darius: oh that's *awesome*
02:09:43 <phubuh> class is out though :-)
02:34:24 <basti_> hi all
02:34:39 <shapr> hi basti_ 
02:34:43 <basti_> hi shapr...
02:35:12 <basti_> say, do you know how haskell byte code is like? I stumbled across a wiki that told me that hugs (for example) uses haskell bytecode
02:35:22 <basti_> i couldnt quite make sense of htat
02:35:38 <shapr> no, I don't know.
02:35:51 <basti_> hm.
02:36:10 <basti_> i suppose thats just a misinformation
02:36:26 <Heffalump> there is no one "Haskell bytecode"
02:36:34 <basti_> ah
02:36:47 <basti_> but there are systems that generate bytecode like stuff?
02:36:55 <Heffalump> I'm not actually sure if any systems really use bytecode, actually. NHC might.
02:37:10 <Heffalump> GHC compiles to C or to native code.
02:37:17 <basti_> yeah i knew that
02:37:26 <Heffalump> Hugs is essentially an interpreter.
02:37:39 <basti_> I thought that too...
02:37:49 <Heffalump> I don't think it really uses a bytecode, it just reads in programs and executes them mostly directly.
02:38:06 * basti_ nods
02:38:28 <basti_> I think a byte code intermediate step would mostly be programming annoyance there
02:39:18 <basti_> whatever... It just came to my mind for an instant... no way near important...
02:39:38 <basti_> I finished my moving now and soon will have some time to code in haskell, thats what is important ;)
02:40:06 <Heffalump> good good :-)
02:54:21 <shapr> hack :: Coder -> Caffeine -> Code
02:55:34 <Darius> GHC uses a byte code interpreter for GHCi
03:02:09 <Heffalump> oh yeah, I forgot about that
03:09:56 <Lunar^> shapr: IO Code, no ?
03:49:31 <SyntaxPolice> mornin'
04:18:23 <Igloo> 'ello
04:22:20 <SyntaxPolice> hi Igloo. still haven't gotten to your email. I was moving all weekend.
04:23:24 <Igloo> OK  :-)
04:24:17 <SyntaxPolice> my arms are tired
04:33:33 <kunyuk> hai'
04:33:48 <earthy> hack :: IO Coder -> Caffeine -> IO Code
04:34:33 <kunyuk> hai
04:34:38 <kunyuk> can you help me
04:42:04 <harsha123> hello #haskell
04:42:11 <SyntaxPolice> hi harsha123
04:42:12 <harsha123> shapr: Hello
04:42:17 <harsha123> hi SyntaxPolice
04:43:06 <shapr> hi harsha123 
04:43:12 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: ! yr up!
04:43:18 <shapr> I am?
04:43:31 <harsha123> hi shapr .. 
04:43:40 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: yes!
04:44:17 <harsha123> shapr: hmm what do you think is the good/best tool/programming language to creat a Graphical installer for linux
04:44:36 <harsha123> shapr: my boss wants me to design one for your customized debian installer.
04:44:54 <harsha123> shapr: i suggested python.. he wants to use kylix.. :(
04:45:16 <shapr> harsha123: isn't kylix closed source?
04:45:21 <harsha123> shapr:  i wanna prove him wrong
04:45:36 <harsha123> shapr: hmm it has an open version too. (free)
04:46:01 <shapr> I'd go for python over pascal personally.
04:46:11 <shapr> what sort of graphical installer for linux do you want?
04:46:16 <shapr> do you want to install linux?
04:46:16 <harsha123> shapr: hmm kylix uses C++ 
04:46:31 <harsha123> shapr: yes to install our customized linux
04:46:44 <SyntaxPolice> hey shapr, ever messed w/ jakarta's httpclient in your travels?
04:47:03 <shapr> why not adapt an open source installer someone else wrote?
04:47:15 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: are you talking about installing an entire linux distribution?
04:47:16 <shapr> seems like that would take the least time
04:47:31 <shapr> but I would always choose Python over C++ for writing code
04:47:35 <SyntaxPolice> someone here is involved with the debian installer problem. martin--, right?
04:47:45 <harsha123> shapr: we have customized debian to do some specifc tasks.
04:47:49 <shapr> especially since Python allows you to use C++ when you want to do that.
04:48:32 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice: yes an entire linux distribution.. includeing partitioning.. etc etc
04:48:45 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: such an installer is a _big_ task!
04:48:55 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice: hehehe.. I know.. 
04:49:26 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice: -or- is it???
04:50:26 <harsha123> my boss says kylix is a RAD too and the GUI is very easy to design.. but i argued that it is not flexible enough
04:50:37 <harsha123> RAD tool
04:50:50 <SyntaxPolice> harsha123: I would talk to the debian-installer folks: http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
04:51:11 <shapr> C++ is flexible, it's just lower level than I prefer to work.
04:51:12 <SyntaxPolice> particulary marvin-- on here
04:51:24 <shapr> I prefer to work at a higher level when possible.
04:51:29 <shapr> takes less time to write stuff then.
04:51:44 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: did you see my question?
04:51:46 <harsha123> yeah.. 
04:51:56 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: yes, I'm trying to remember.
04:52:07 <shapr> harsha123: I think it will take more time to write an installer in C++ than to write it in Python.
04:52:19 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/
04:52:30 <harsha123> hmm I told him that too..
04:52:34 <shapr> though both can do the same job, it's the time cost that's usually important to the person who's paying money.
04:52:51 <harsha123> shapr: yes i agree
04:53:23 <harsha123> SyntaxPolice: i dont think marvin-- is here right now
04:53:33 <shapr> also, Python includes C or C++ if you want, see http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers
04:53:47 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: no, I think I used java.net when I needed to make my own http calls.
04:53:51 <harsha123> shapr: ok .. i ll look into it
04:54:31 * Darius saw java.net and was like wtf?! for a second.
04:55:54 <SyntaxPolice> Darius: have you become a victim of marketing?
04:56:10 <shapr> Darius: I mean java.net.* libraries.
04:56:16 * shapr snickers
04:56:24 <Darius> shapr: I know
04:56:29 <Darius> SyntaxPolice: I guess
04:56:42 <shapr> It's unlikely I will ever work with .NET stuff
05:10:37 <shapr> hoi kosmikus 
05:27:14 * shapr boings
05:40:59 * SyntaxPolice bounces
05:52:33 * Lunar^ spins round
05:53:05 <shapr> I want new Haskell code!
05:53:11 <shapr> I must feed my addiction!
05:56:10 <cm> mmm
05:56:41 <shapr> cm: quick, write me some code!
05:57:06 <cm> must.. code.. php..
05:57:22 * cm hides in the shadows
05:58:28 <earthy> oh, he wants Haskell code...
05:58:34 <earthy> I almost pasted some Algol. :)
06:00:37 <shapr> :-P
06:00:42 <shapr> cm: eww, php!
06:00:56 <cm> shapr: i have to, work :(
06:01:08 <shapr> I'm writing Python code for work.
06:01:12 <cm> lucky you
06:01:16 <shapr> which I prefer over PHP honestly.
06:01:22 <cm> yeah it's much better IMO.
06:01:50 <cm> shapr: once i'm good at haskell i'll secretly convert all code into haskell and then slap them all with an ultrasmall codebae :P
06:01:56 <shapr> yay!
06:02:05 <shapr> cm: have you been practicing your haskell lately?
06:02:39 <cm> spending almost my entire time at school + work (php :).. trying to practice it
06:02:47 <cm> monad combinators.. lift.. mmm :o
06:04:29 <cm> failed to compile HOpenGL on mingw/msys :((
06:04:40 <shapr> suckage
06:05:12 <cm> what are you coding in haskell?
06:05:22 <shapr> at the moment, I'm getting my spam filter back in shape
06:05:37 <shapr> I'd like to get it up to usability
06:05:42 <cm> coded in haskell?
06:05:44 <shapr> yup
06:05:45 <cm> cool :)
06:09:10 <cm> mmm, off to school and then work. ttyl :)
06:09:14 * cm hugs the shadows
06:11:12 <harsha123> shapr: does your mail filter use any db extensions? or it is file based?
06:11:38 <Lunar^> shapr: Did you look at WASHMail's MailParser btw ?
06:11:44 <shapr> Lunar^: no, I haven't
06:11:51 <shapr> harsha123: it's file based
06:12:49 <shapr> at least, I think it is :-)
06:12:54 <shapr> it's a bayesian filter
06:13:07 <harsha123> shapr: i plan to write one mail filter in haskell(i think i've told you this).. i thought i'll use some db extensions..
06:13:25 <shapr> yes, you've told me.
06:13:28 <harsha123> hmm does haskell provide db extensions ?
06:13:36 <shapr> what sort of db extensions do you mean?
06:14:16 <harsha123> shapr: basically api kinda stuff to write to a db and retrive info from db
06:14:56 * harsha123 is presently rocking to some Tool :)
06:15:10 * shapr is rocking to Dave Matthews
06:15:18 <shapr> but about to switch to Rage Against the Machine
06:15:24 <harsha123> hehe..
06:15:38 <harsha123> rage rox..its amazing..:)
06:15:42 <shapr> yup
06:15:47 <shapr> sort of sucks that they broke up though.
06:15:59 <harsha123> :( really? i didnt know this
06:16:21 <shapr> lead singer of ratm left, the rest of the band hooked up with the lead singer of soundgarden, and are now called audioslave
06:16:26 <shapr> sadly, audioslave sucks.
06:16:37 <shapr> the style is nice, but has zero content.
06:16:47 <harsha123> ahh i heard of audioslave. didnt like too much though
06:17:08 <shapr> I bought the album, I figured the combo of ratm and soundgarden had to be listened to...
06:17:10 <shapr> but it's not worth it.
06:17:36 <harsha123> hehee  too many *different* cooks spoil the broth.. ;)
06:17:40 <shapr> yup
06:18:12 <harsha123> omg.. i had typed *cocks* . i changed it though hahaha
06:19:38 <harsha123> shapr: have you used a lot of regex in your filter?
06:19:54 <harsha123> i guess its just that? 
06:20:03 <shapr> no, I don't use any.
06:20:12 <harsha123> Ok..
06:20:13 <phubuh_> bayesian? :-)
06:20:28 <shapr> the rfc2822 parser uses Parsec, but it's a monadic parser generator, it doesn't use regexps either.
06:20:43 <harsha123> hmmm Ok
06:21:16 <harsha123> whats a monadic parser?
06:21:33 <shapr> there's a nice research paper about monadic parser combinators
06:21:38 <shapr> I think that's the name of it too
06:21:46 <harsha123> Ok
06:21:50 <harsha123> link? :)
06:22:03 <shapr> http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/hutton96monadic.html
06:26:06 <andersca> hej shapr
06:26:31 <shapr> hej andersca, hur är det med dig?
06:27:18 <andersca> jag Ã¤r fÃ¶rkyld
06:27:25 <shapr> varför?
06:27:36 <shapr> darför det är vinter?
06:27:52 <andersca> ja
06:28:50 <harsha123> shapr: so you are basically parsing the mail header to filter mail?
06:33:18 <shapr> the entire email is parsed
06:33:30 <harsha123> hmm ok. 
06:33:48 <shapr> with bayesian filtering, you have two collections of email, one of spam, one of 'ham' or real email
06:34:43 <Igloo> Do you actually have 2 collections or just 2 datastructures?
06:34:54 <harsha123> shapr: when you say bayseain filtering.. i guess its the bayesian alogorithm to filter email.. have you implemented the bayesian alogorithm?
06:40:13 <shapr> harsha123: yes, it's a tiny algorithm
06:40:26 <harsha123> shapr: ok
06:45:08 <shapr> Igloo: I have ~6500 spams in one of my email folders
06:45:35 <Igloo> shapr: But does the Bayesian filter look at that or just its own internal datastructures?
06:46:00 <shapr> it builds a histogram FM from those emails.
06:46:15 <Igloo> Every time you run it?
06:46:15 <shapr> then uses that histogram to calculate the spam probability
06:46:23 <shapr> no, only when you ask it to train.
06:46:34 <Igloo> Right, OK
06:46:45 <harsha123> shapr: does a bayesion filter mean its  self learning?
06:47:01 <shapr> last I checked it got about 85% correct, but that's still really bad compared to other filters.
06:47:05 <shapr> harsha123: yes
06:48:10 <Darius> shapr: An array would probably be better than an FM for the histogram unless you are changing it when calculating probabilities.
06:48:18 <shapr> I am
06:48:25 <shapr> er wait
06:48:26 <shapr> no I'm not
06:48:27 <shapr> hmm
06:48:32 <shapr> good point, thanks.
06:48:53 <Igloo> What's the type of the FM?
06:49:00 * shapr adds that to the TODO list
06:49:08 <shapr> Igloo: String -> Float iirc
06:49:27 <shapr> 1.0 is "100% chance this is a spam word" and 0.0 is "0% chance this is a spam word"
06:49:34 <Igloo> Where the Strings are of potentially unbounded size?
06:49:51 <Igloo> I guess you could hash them to index into the array
06:50:05 <shapr> possibly, but realistically speaking the email parser won't deal with illegal emails
06:50:13 <Darius> You should use Doubles unless you have a good reason otherwise.  About the only decent reason being space for massive amounts of numbers.
06:50:13 <Igloo> And have an array of FMs, presumably
06:50:24 <shapr> so 80 chars is the largest possible word (I indexed some mime attachments accidentally)
06:50:42 <Igloo> Even that would mean you can't index the array on the Strings directly
06:51:13 <shapr> speaking of which, I'd like to have a Haskell MIME parser 
06:51:21 <shapr> I need to check out WASHmail
06:51:52 <shapr> Igloo: I don't understand?
06:52:10 <Igloo> Don't understand what?
06:52:43 * shapr rereads
06:52:59 <shapr> oh
06:53:07 <shapr> "ways to lookup stuff faster"
06:53:25 <Igloo> Isn't that what you were talking about?
06:53:37 <shapr> yes, I guess so :-)
06:56:46 <harsha123> how different is it to program haskell on hugs and ghc ?
06:56:49 <harsha123> is the syntax same?
06:56:52 <shapr> yup
06:57:05 <shapr> difference is like a C compiler versus a C interpreter
06:57:21 <harsha123> Ok
06:59:57 <harsha123> i struggeled yesterday to create a automaton that accepts even no. of 0's and odd no. of 1's  :(
07:00:06 <shapr> in Haskell?
07:00:18 <harsha123> nope... just an automaton.. 
07:00:29 <shapr> oh
07:01:04 <harsha123> shapr: you know any linux app .. that i can draw atomatons? 
07:01:43 <shapr> have you looked at the ragel deb?
07:01:54 <harsha123> shapr: no.. 
07:02:27 <harsha123> shapr: need a tool.. just to show to to everyone what I have done.. helps when I am seeking help..
07:02:45 <shapr> I usually use a napkin when drawing FSMs :-)
07:03:04 <harsha123> napkin???
07:03:34 <harsha123> why not a piece of paper? :p
07:03:40 <shapr> I rarely have paper around.
07:03:50 <harsha123> hehehe Ok
07:04:01 <shapr> have you tried using something like Dia?
07:04:14 <harsha123> Dia.. no..
07:05:13 <harsha123> shapr: why would you draw FSM's ?  :-)
07:05:22 <harsha123> just a lil curious.. :)
07:06:59 <harsha123> i actually havent got a porper solution to draw a FSM that accepts odd no. of 1's and even # of 0's
07:08:00 <harsha123> any help guys?
07:08:02 <harsha123> :)
07:08:19 <shapr> I draw FSMs for explaining them to other people usually.
07:09:07 <harsha123> hmmm..ok
07:33:25 <phubuh_> data Value = Num Integer
07:33:25 <phubuh_>            | Fun (Value -> Uncertain Value)
07:33:25 <phubuh_>              deriving Show
07:33:44 <phubuh_> the derive clause doesn't work since (Value -> Uncertain Value) isn't showable ... how do i instantiate Show for that type?
07:34:28 <Darius> How do you want to show a Value when it's a function?
07:34:54 <phubuh_> "<function>", perhaps
07:35:11 <Darius> Then import Show.Function.
07:35:18 <phubuh_> ah :)
07:35:34 <Darius> that's the easiest solution.
07:36:07 <phubuh_> there's no Show.Function in hugs :/
07:37:03 <Darius> It might be ShowFunction
07:37:20 <Darius> Either way making your own instance of Show for Value or for all functions isn't hard.
07:37:44 <phubuh_> ah, of course, i can just make a general a -> b show
07:38:18 <phubuh_> yay! thanks
07:43:43 <phubuh_> ShowFunctions
07:43:43 <phubuh_> :-)
07:43:57 <Lunar^> Yah! Jerzy is doing a course about compilation using Haskell
07:45:18 <shapr> Lunar^: oooh, you take courses from Jerzy?
07:45:25 <phubuh_> jerzy? :-)
07:45:51 <Lunar^> shapr: No, but of friend of mine did
07:46:00 <Lunar^> shapr: I met him 2 years ago
07:46:03 <Lunar^> shapr: He's so kind :)
07:46:06 <shapr> jerzy karczmarczuk
07:46:12 <shapr> he's funny too
07:46:20 <shapr> funniest writer on c.l.f in my opinion.
07:46:29 <shapr> I met him at ICFP, I immediately told him that.
07:46:32 <Lunar^> I agree :) (though I stop reading c.l.f)
07:46:44 <shapr> he's just as funny on the haskell mailing lists.
07:46:56 <Lunar^> Damn.. wish I could be there next time
07:48:13 <shapr> do it!
07:48:29 <shapr> I don't know if I'll be there next time, I'm saving up for an expensive PC.
07:49:03 <Lunar^> Maybe I could manage to get my scool paying me the trip
07:49:13 <mgoetze|away> shapr: will you give me your old one once you've got it?
07:50:01 <shapr> mgoetze|away: I'm going to use it as a server machine I think
07:50:10 <mgoetze|away> shapr: oh :(
07:50:14 * mgoetze|away wants a dual athlon
07:50:20 <shapr> I'm aiming for a 4-way opteron next.
07:50:34 * mgoetze|away is aiming to strangle shapr next
07:50:39 * shapr snickers
07:50:42 <Lunar^> urg
07:53:09 <shapr> or maybe I should fund Haskell development
07:54:12 <shapr> I wonder how I could do that.
07:57:49 <Darius> Pay yourself profusely to write Haskell.
07:58:18 <phubuh_> Main> showResult $ eval [] $ Add (Con 2) (Lam "x" (Con 10))
07:58:18 <phubuh_> "Error: 1st argument of incorrect type (Num) in addition (Con -> Con -> Con)"
07:58:19 <phubuh_> yay!!!
07:58:50 <phubuh_> err.
07:58:55 <shapr> Darius: that's an interesting thought.
07:58:57 <phubuh_> strike that yay
07:59:13 <shapr> Darius: alternatively, I could pay YOU to write Haskell!
08:00:09 * shapr attempts witty reparty

09:07:30 <kosmikus> Heff: ??
09:07:49 <Lunar^> mail sent to John Peterson
09:08:41 <Heffalump> kosmikus: oh, it's back.
09:08:47 <Heffalump> I couldn't get a response from it.
09:09:26 <kosmikus> on Saturday?
09:10:24 <Heffalump> no, just now
09:30:23 <Lunar^> Jerzy rocks
09:30:55 <Lunar^> The notes for his course are really good
12:54:30 <Xcalibor> hi there, Maddas :)
12:55:02 <Maddas> Hi.
12:55:05 <Maddas> Just lurking and absorbing :)
12:56:57 <Xcalibor> not much going on around, actually, but things kinda sprout all of a sudden in here, so... :-)
12:56:59 <phubuh_> so, back to what we were saying about zygomorphisms and other abstract nonsense!
12:57:04 * phubuh_ scares away the MLers
12:57:08 <Xcalibor> nice feature: lambdabot is nice
12:57:19 <Xcalibor> @arr
12:57:19 <lambdabot> Ahoy mateys
12:57:24 <Maddas> phubuh_: I came here to learn about new things, so you're just making it more interesting!
12:57:26 <Riastradh> @yow
12:57:27 <lambdabot> Yow!  Am I in Milwaukee?
12:57:30 <Riastradh> @yow
12:57:30 <lambdabot> So this is what it feels like to be potato salad
12:58:08 <phubuh_> Maddas, i don't know anything about category theory, actually :~(
12:58:16 <Xcalibor> @eval show . reverse . read $ 12345
12:58:18 <lambdabot> unbound variable: show
12:58:25 <phubuh_> i'd like to learn about it though, i'm a huge fan of abstract nonsense
12:58:26 <Maddas> phubuh_: me neither. Not yet.
12:58:38 <Maddas> So am I. But I'm not very educated yet :)
12:58:43 <Xcalibor> mmm....
12:58:56 <phubuh_> Xcalibor, @eval evaluates a dialect of lambda calculus, not haskell :-)
12:59:14 <phubuh_> @eval (\x.x+2) 5
12:59:14 <lambdabot> 7
12:59:34 <Riastradh> You don't need to know anything about category theory.
12:59:41 <Xcalibor> phubuh_: oh, yeah, that's true....
12:59:54 <phubuh_> Riastradh, i don't really need to know anything about haskell, either.
12:59:56 <Riastradh> I know absolutely nothing about category theory, but I understand monads better than Bill Gates loves money.
13:00:11 <phubuh_> oh, to understand haskell, you mean? yeah, i agree.
13:00:11 <Maddas> Now that's self-confidence.
13:00:22 <Riastradh> Yes, indeed.

13:02:30 <lambdabot> quux /kwuhks/ n. [Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb quuxo,
13:02:30 <lambdabot>    quuxare, quuxandum iri; noun form variously `quux' (plural `quuces',
13:02:30 <lambdabot>    anglicized to `quuxes') and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for
13:02:31 <lambdabot>    four u-letters out of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in
13:02:33 <lambdabot>    Scrabble).] 1. Originally, a {metasyntactic variable} like {foo} and
13:02:37 <lambdabot>    {foobar}. Invented by Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was
13:02:37 <lambdabot>    young and naive and not yet interacting with the real computing

13:03:11 <lambdabot>    community. Many people invent such words; this one seems simply to have
13:03:11 <lambdabot>    been lucky enough to have spread a little. In an eloquent display of
13:03:11 <lambdabot>    poetic justice, it has returned to the originator in the form of a
13:03:11 <lambdabot>    nickname. 2. interj. See {foo}; however, denotes very little disgust,
13:03:11 <lambdabot>    and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. Guy Steele in
13:03:12 <lambdabot>    his persona as `The Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light
13:03:14 <lambdabot>    verse and for the `Crunchly' cartoons. 4. In some circles, used as a
13:03:16 <lambdabot>    punning opposite of `crux'. "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" implies
13:03:18 <lambdabot>    that the point is _not_ crucial (compare {tip of the ice-cube}). 5.

13:04:40 <Xcalibor> Maddas: nreverse   :: Int -> Int
13:04:40 <Xcalibor> nreverse n = 
13:04:40 <Xcalibor> 	read . reverse . show $ n
13:05:01 <Xcalibor> Maddas: and now you can write: nreverse 12345
13:05:01 <Xcalibor> 54321
13:05:03 <phubuh_> you can omit the n :-)
13:05:07 <Xcalibor> nice, uh? :-)
13:05:21 <Xcalibor> phubuh_: well, yes... :-) 
13:05:24 <Maddas> Hum?
13:05:33 <Xcalibor> . is functional composition
13:05:37 <Riastradh> nreverse = read . reverse . show
13:05:47 <Maddas> Why is that directod to me? (I'm slightly confused)
13:05:54 <Maddas> directed, even
13:05:59 <Xcalibor> Haskell allows very nice solutions by composing functions...
13:06:37 <Xcalibor> Maddas: so you can have a taste of practical Haskell... try writing that nreverse function in OCaml, it's surprisingly hairy
13:06:42 <Riastradh> That sort of style is called 'point-free,' but it's also sometimes referred to as 'pointless,' which many Haskellers think it is.
13:06:59 <Maddas> I see.
13:07:13 <phubuh_> i like it for small utility function chains
13:07:26 <Darius> XCalibor: I'd imagine the OCaml version would be virtually identical.
13:07:30 <Lor> It's point-free even though its most distinguishing characteristic is the abundance of .'s :)
13:08:00 <phubuh_> let nreverse n = int_of_string (String.rev (string_of_int n));;
13:08:08 <phubuh_> or whatever the string reversal function is called
13:08:15 <Lor> Is there such a thing?
13:08:19 <Xcalibor> i like it for final solutions.... you define a couple of aux functionas and a couple of intelligent higher order functions an then your problem is simple a kind of solution = map foo . filter bar . foldr baz []
13:08:25 <Lor> Doesn't seem so useful as to be included in the standard library.
13:08:31 <Xcalibor> phubuh_: nope
13:08:36 <Smerdyakov> Lor, what doesn't?
13:08:37 <phubuh_> oh.
13:08:49 <Lor> Smerdyakov, string reversal.
13:09:19 <Smerdyakov> That's just list reversal, so it's certainly included!
13:09:30 <Xcalibor> Darius: after you have some pains reading the numbers and reversing them, it is...
13:09:31 <Lor> In ocaml?
13:09:42 <Smerdyakov> No, in Haskell.
13:09:45 <Xcalibor> Smerdyakov: it's list reversal, but strings are not lists of characters in OCaml
13:09:46 <shapr> forth!
13:09:52 <Smerdyakov> If we've switched to OCaml, then sorry, I lost track. :)
13:09:57 <Xcalibor> hey shapr :)
13:10:00 <shapr> hi Xcalibor 
13:10:28 <Xcalibor> Smerdyakov: yup, we are jumpin' here and there...
13:10:36 <shapr> I want code!
13:10:44 <phubuh_> let nreverse n = int_of_string (String.foldl (fun x y -> y::x) (string_of_int n));;
13:10:46 <phubuh_> or something.
13:10:55 <phubuh_> gah, :: doesn't work on chars
13:11:13 <Xcalibor> phubuh_: remember, strings aren't lists of chars :-)
13:11:15 <phubuh_> i give up :(
13:11:36 <Xcalibor> phubuh_: we managed to get a working solution the other day.. but as I said, it's really hairy...
13:11:43 <shapr> lists of char might be slow, but it sure is elegant.
13:11:52 <Xcalibor> shapr: indeed
13:12:25 <shapr> I always choose elegance when possible.
13:12:57 <Xcalibor> if it works and it's elegant, it's usually better than a solution that simply works
13:13:02 <phubuh_> i always find myself converting mostly all of my strings to [char] when i code ocaml
13:13:07 <Xcalibor> at least that's what Einstein said
13:13:17 <shapr> yes, elegance is pleasing.
13:13:23 <Lor> phubuh, are you aware that there is a special string indexing syntax in ocaml?
13:13:32 <phubuh_> str.[i], yes?
13:13:43 <Lor> Yeah.
13:13:47 <Riastradh> I think in general it doesn't matter how strings are implemented, as long as you can fold them left and right.
13:13:50 <Smerdyakov> Xcalibor, I think that is a ridiculously anthropocentric sort of statement, if it's taken to apply to the world in general.
13:13:54 <Maddas> yes, phubuh_ 
13:14:25 <Smerdyakov> Riastradh, hardly. Those don't allow you to do constant time projection of individual characters by index.
13:14:28 <Maddas> Xcalibor: Elegance isn't the most important criteria of a program, usually
13:14:28 <Lor> I think that using lists to represent strings is only marginally more sensible than using church numerals for ordinary arithmetic.
13:14:30 <phubuh_> i don't need to bother with real-world concerns such as efficiency so i just shoot for the most elegant and simple thing that could possibly work
13:14:40 <Maddas> phubuh_: You're lucky then :)
13:14:46 <shapr> Smerdyakov: athropocentricity is a given in most situations ;-P
13:14:53 <Lor> Then you could just use church encoding for all data structures. What could be more elegant than having everything be a function?
13:15:04 <phubuh_> Lor, but church numerals aren't intuitively equivalent to regular numbers
13:15:14 <Smerdyakov> shapr, how so?
13:15:24 <Lor> It's no big deal to extend them to integers.
13:15:41 <Lor> If you meant that there are no negative church numbers.
13:15:42 <Xcalibor> Smerdyakov: well, it certainly works in Physics, where Albert Einstein excelled...
13:15:56 <shapr> @wn anthropocentric
13:15:56 <phubuh_> no, i mean that when i think number, i don't think church numeral
13:15:57 <lambdabot> *** "anthropocentric" wn "WordNet (r) 2.0"
13:15:57 <lambdabot> anthropocentric
13:15:57 <lambdabot>      adj : human-centered; "our anthropocentric view of the world"
13:16:02 <Xcalibor> elegance appears to be a mathematical abstraction rather than a matter of personal taste
13:16:08 <Lor> phubuh, it's just a representation.
13:16:16 <Smerdyakov> Xcalibor, how do you know it works? There are still unanswered questions, and the current theory has been shown fundamentally incorrect before.
13:16:23 <shapr> Smerdyakov: I usually relate things to myself or others, so I think everything in anthropocentric
13:16:25 <Xcalibor> and while I agreee that human Maths are anthropocentric, they are less than, mmm... aesthetics
13:16:31 <Lor> You can provide an abstract "Nat" datatype which is implemented as church numerals behind the scenes.
13:16:33 <phubuh_> in my mind, a string *is* a list of characters, but a number is *certainly* not a church numeral
13:16:43 <Smerdyakov> shapr, that has nothing to do with the correctness of hypotheses about the universe in general.
13:16:54 <Xcalibor> Smerdyakov: but it works so far for many cases... at least well enough to give many answers
13:17:00 <Lor> phubuh, why is a string a list of characters instead of an array?
13:17:17 <shapr> Smerdyakov: I never said that, I just said that anthropocentricity is a given in a society of humans.
13:17:23 <shapr> like.. duh :-)
13:17:36 * shapr feels so valleygirl today
13:17:36 <phubuh_> Lor, i don't know why, but i don't think in arrays.
13:17:44 <Lor> phubuh, and what if _lists_ were implemented as church encodings, and you just weren't aware of it?
13:17:45 <Xcalibor> shapr: certainly most humans think only about their bellies, that's right...
13:17:55 <shapr> Xcalibor: yes, exactly.
13:18:03 <phubuh_> Lor, i don't care what happens behind the scenes, i'm talking about the interface
13:18:05 <shapr> anthropotorsocentric.
13:18:28 <Lor> phubuh, the interface that church numerals implement _is_ exactly the usual interface for natural numbers.
13:18:35 <Xcalibor> shapr: and most of those are even more worried about what happens just below their bellies... ;-)
13:18:46 <Lor> As I said, it's just a representation.
13:18:49 <shapr> anthropocoitocentric?
13:18:51 <Xcalibor> anthropocarinacentric ;-)
13:18:59 <shapr> carina? who's she?
13:19:11 <Xcalibor> yeah... well, latin for hips
13:19:15 <phubuh_> Lor, so using church numerals is no different than using natural numbers? the only difference is "behind the scenes", so to speak?
13:20:00 <Riastradh> phubuh, that's the idea of separating interface from implementation.
13:20:07 <Lor> If you make them an abstract type and only provide the proper interface, then yes.
13:20:40 <shapr> sandos: dude, you reconnect a lot
13:20:52 <phubuh_> well then, i suppose implementing numbers as church numerals is fine then.
13:27:13 * shapr hacks on his spam filter

13:32:57 <Maddas> Xcalibor: physics isn't programming
13:33:24 <Maddas> ;-)
13:36:05 <Maddas> ok, you guys can continue talking!
13:36:23 <shapr> Maddas: what should we say?
13:37:01 <Maddas> Anything that makes my pseudo-funny statements scroll away.
13:37:10 <Xcalibor> Maddas: physics isn't programming, that's true... but Science and Art do share a lot of things...
13:37:19 <yazirian> like people!
13:37:22 <yazirian> people do both
13:37:30 <yazirian> and smocks
13:37:32 <shapr> right, athropocentricity rulez d00d!
13:37:38 <yazirian> smocks are critical to both fields
13:37:43 <shapr> yes, he smocked me publically.

13:59:15 <blackdog> i asked pete, but he's got shocking latency. i'll let you know.
13:59:25 <shapr> ok
13:59:41 <shapr> blackdog: heh, what time do you go to bed?
14:02:19 <blackdog> it used to be about 3, but these days it's just as likely to be 10... you crazy europeans have played havoc with my internal clock.
14:03:37 <Maddas> heh
14:07:13 <Igloo> You mean we've corrected it?  :-)

14:13:12 <shapr> oh that does sound exciting
14:13:17 <shapr> anything I can help with?
14:15:04 <blackdog> Nah, i think it's all set up nicely now. ALthough you could point me at your emacs tricks page.
14:15:33 <shapr> http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/EmacsNiftyTricks
14:16:10 <blackdog> i had a nice ... phenomenon on the gateway. every time i plugged in a particular network card, the monitor got no signal.
14:16:23 <Maddas> he
14:16:39 <Maddas> How did you manage to do that?
14:16:39 <shapr> heh
14:16:43 <shapr> yah, that's impressive
14:17:25 <Maddas> I'm sure you could turn that bug into a feature, somehow
14:18:45 <blackdog> I really don't know how it happened, but it was 100% reproducible.

14:37:29 <shapr> why be subtle about it?
14:38:44 <Igloo> Well, I already asked on nhc-bugs, he gave me an answer that didn't work and I told him (maybe I wasn't clear), but he didn't reply
14:39:08 <shapr> so, ask again :-)
14:39:28 <shapr> subtlety is overrated, though maybe that's just my opinion.
14:39:57 <Igloo> He could just be busy, though
14:40:24 <shapr> that's true.
14:42:05 <shapr> some of my friends in boden took nifty pictures: http://www.nighttimephotos.cjb.net/

21:27:34 <Crusoe> I got a question, can someone describe what the heck a monad is?
21:31:34 <Smerdyakov> The Internet can explain it best!
21:31:34 <Crusoe> No, it still doesn't. I know it is some fancy-schmancy math definition, but what does it solve for me the programmer? I understand Clean's uniqueness types ( clean monads ). Since functional languages essentially execute in a non-linear fashion ( through pattern matching/expansion ), uniqueness types ensure access to a a 'var' that can change is sequential.
21:35:35 <Crusoe> I grok that monads somehow apply to this as well. It also ties into aliasing, etc. But I'm not a mathematician, I'm a programmer. What does it give me? No one has written a good functional languge tutorial from the programmer end of things.
21:35:35 <Smerdyakov> Monads do not provide effects in Haskell.
21:35:35 <Smerdyakov> They are a convenient interface to code written in other languages that produces effects, such as Haskell compiler runtime systems.
21:35:35 <Smerdyakov> Anyway, you probably want to read http://www.abercrombiegroup.co.uk/~noel/research/monads.html
21:37:36 <Crusoe> And they are all written from a math perspective.... >.<
21:37:36 <Crusoe> The benefit of a lack of effects, is that aliasing is not an issue. But it causes problems with managing 'state'. 
21:45:58 <blackdog> as it happens, i was just working through http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/index.html
21:45:58 <blackdog> highly recommended...
21:45:58 <Smerdyakov> The page to which I linked is not written from a math perspective.
21:45:58 <Smerdyakov> Do you say that it is?
21:45:58 <Crusoe> I want it written from a programming perspective... It talks about monads a solution to the problem of 'state' and side effects. But why does Haskell have these 'problems'?
21:45:58 <Smerdyakov> Are you asking why Haskell is designed to be pure functional?
21:57:05 <Smerdyakov> Hello?
21:57:05 <Crusoe> My problem grokking is understanding execution in Haskell.
21:57:05 <Smerdyakov> OK. Do you have a specific question?
21:57:05 <Crusoe> Von neuman architecture, state is essential. But in pure functional languages, state by definition may introduce side effects. 
21:57:05 <Smerdyakov> But not if you model state changes by passing extra state from function to function.
21:57:05 <Smerdyakov> So what's your question?
21:57:05 * Crusoe re-reads again and again "So one use of monads is 'plumbing' state from function to function?
21:57:06 <Smerdyakov> Was that a question?
21:57:06 <Crusoe> It has a question mark, so yes.
21:57:06 <Smerdyakov> The quotation mark is confusing.
21:57:06 <Smerdyakov> Is everything after it your question?
21:57:06 <Crusoe> Yeah, forget the closing "
21:57:06 <blackdog> you're not going to be enlightened quickly if you only questions with one-bit answers.:)
21:57:06 <blackdog> ask questions, even.
21:57:06 <Smerdyakov> Hm, it's odd to put your own question within quotation marks, but: Yes. :)
21:57:06 <Crusoe> It's proper english to go  -> Bob reread his term paper, "Teacher, is question 2B correct, or is there a typo?" 
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> Yes, but Bob wouldn't usually say that.
21:58:45 <Strike> it's proper English to capitalize 'English'
21:58:45 * Strike ducks
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> Meaning, Bob wouldn't usually talk about "what Bob said."
21:58:45 <Crusoe> Okay, so what does monad mean? 
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> In Haskell, it's the name of a type class.
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> It
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> It's defined entirely by the type class definition.
21:58:45 <Smerdyakov> Nothing theoretical or mathy about it.
22:00:46 <Crusoe> This time mathematically, because monads are based on math.
22:00:46 <Smerdyakov> Monad has a different meaning in category theory or somesuch that isn't worth discussing if you're trying to learn Haskell.
22:00:46 <Smerdyakov> Really, you will only confuse yourself starting with the premise that this language feature is "based on math.
22:00:46 <Crusoe> Well, even if Haskell's monads are just a limited subset of 'true' monads...
22:02:15 <Smerdyakov> I don't think they are.
22:02:15 <Smerdyakov> Monads are a veeery simple concept.
22:02:15 <Smerdyakov> Do you know Java?
22:02:15 <Crusoe> Yes
22:05:54 <Smerdyakov> Haskell's concept of monad is basically a Java interface with a few algebraic laws that the functions should obey.
22:05:54 <Smerdyakov> I think 2 or 3 such laws, written as simple equations.
22:05:54 <ibid> the laws are, i believe, the monad laws from category theory?
22:07:19 <Smerdyakov> *shrug* I don't think that's very helpful, even if they are.
22:17:27 <ibid> true
22:17:27 <Crusoe> Okay, Foldoc is good, and I think I kinda may grok the category theory ideas that would make it useful in functional languages.
22:27:29 <ibid> i hadn't noticed before that bird sneaks a simplistic version of lattice theory / semantic domains in his introduction to fp book :)
