01:52:11 <thornber> morning
03:08:51 * Riastradh implorbs.
03:10:29 <Marvin--> that sounds yucky
03:12:23 <Riastradh> Perhaps it is.
03:29:25 * shapr explorbs
03:38:40 * jlouis curses... hugs does not seem to run on OpenBSD 3.3
03:39:00 <jlouis> now we try without stack protection
04:00:07 * kosmikus transplorbs
04:04:06 <jlouis> oh, it was the FFI interface... disabled
04:30:35 <Marvin--> interesting
04:32:32 <mgoetze> hm?
04:34:37 <Marvin--> War3:FT won't be out until July here, but it's already the fourth most bought thing over the last 30 days at tradition.se
04:36:06 <Jolta> Marvin--: People are stranger, People deranged are...
04:57:11 <saz> hmm
04:57:18 <saz> in haskell, can functions belong to classes?
04:57:45 <wli> a function can have a type that is a member of a class
04:58:05 <saz> hmm
04:58:25 <saz> so.. is it theoretically possible to define a class of onto functions?
04:59:37 <Marvin--> surjective functions? no, you can't encode semantics in the type classes
05:01:00 * Marvin-- fiddles with case expressions
05:01:15 <saz> hmm
05:01:17 <saz> okay
05:01:25 <saz> so this question is impossible
05:02:03 <Smerdyakov> You can always make an abstract finite function type and check that it fits your criteria when constructing it.
05:02:13 <saz> [writing a function that 'inverts' another function]
05:03:46 <Marvin--> isn't that more related to injective functions?
05:04:03 <Smerdyakov> Needs both!
05:04:03 <Marvin--> we're already dealing with partial functions, so surjectiveness isn't really needed
05:04:20 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: see above ;)
05:05:14 <saz> well, it has to be one to one
05:05:20 <saz> and onto (i think)
05:06:04 <saz> and afaik, it'd be impossible to implement if the inputs are unbounded
05:06:49 <Smerdyakov> saz, like I said: what you want is more to invert a FiniteMap (a type that comes with GHC) than a real function.
05:07:11 <Marvin--> yeah you'd need to invert the representation of a function/mapping/whatever
05:07:32 <saz> ah, okay
05:11:00 <wli> fm' = listToFM . map (uncurry $ flip (,)) . fmToList $ fm
05:11:25 <Marvin--> heh
05:15:54 <saz> *boggle*
05:16:37 <Marvin--> coffee... time for coffee
05:25:55 <Marvin--> wow, what's this, has Simon Marlow gotten his hands on a new version of Micros~1 outlook? His latest mail to g-h-u had an "In-Reply-To" header, cheers!
06:34:37 * shapr boings
06:35:24 <shapr> hi stef_, are you new here?
06:35:33 * shapr bounces happily
06:35:38 <shapr> wli: hey, did you get my email?
06:36:12 <stef_> shapr: yes, I want to learn about functional language and more specifically about type inference
06:36:43 <stef_> I am mostly a C, C++ (berk), Perl programmer. Know a little about Mathematica too
06:36:53 <Lilith> allos shapr
06:36:58 <shapr> stef_: welcome to the #haskell channel, lemme point you to the landmarks...
06:37:03 <shapr> @fact learning
06:37:04 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
06:37:09 <shapr> that's for learning Haskell
06:37:26 <shapr> Many people on this channel keep code in a sourceforge project that's our 'cvs-wiki'
06:37:34 <shapr> @fact haskell-libs 
06:37:34 <lambdabot> Nothing
06:37:39 <stef_> Currently reading: modern compiler implementaition in ML and intersted in SML and OCAML
06:37:45 <shapr> @fact haskell-libs http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/
06:37:45 <lambdabot> set haskell-libs to http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/
06:37:53 <shapr> stef_: oh, that's nifty
06:38:08 <shapr> g'day Lilith, I heard your presentation went well :-)
06:38:25 <stef_> my motivation about all that is that I am following closely the internals of the VM Perl6
06:38:29 <shapr> stef_: do you have any questions at the moment that I can help you with?
06:38:55 <stef_> I must read a lot before asking sensible question.
06:39:07 <stef_> and lurk too...
06:39:12 <shapr> I dunno about the PerlVM, but I do think it's good to learn many different styles of programming.
06:39:27 <stef_> agreed.
06:39:29 <Lilith> shapr: it was ok. i fumbled somewhat at the beginning
06:39:50 <shapr> Lilith: your slides were great, I'm sure they show how much work you've put into this already.
06:40:15 <stef_> too bad that the functional clique is not much interested to contribute to the parrot VM. They have certainly knowledge that perl buff don't have.
06:40:19 <Lilith> shapr: thanks. i'll put up everything when i'm done with designing my logo
06:40:34 <shapr> stef_: so, how have you planned your vacation in the functional world? Will you be learning to program in Haskell?
06:40:48 <thornber> what's the best intro to monads ? (I think I want to write some monadic types, I'm happy with how io works)
06:41:01 <shapr> Lilith: ohh, do you have any logo drafts to look at?
06:41:09 <shapr> thornber: I know of a coupla good urls
06:41:13 * shapr gets urls
06:41:19 <thornber> :)
06:41:31 <Lilith> shapr: not yet. designing one now
06:41:39 <stef_> In fact I am more interested in the implementation of type inference.
06:42:05 <stef_> But you can't extract a nugget without knowing more about the general culture
06:42:14 <Lilith> stef_: would you have a url for the perl VM?
06:42:27 <shapr> @fact monads http://www.abercrombiegroup.co.uk/~noel/research/monads.html http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/monads.html
06:42:28 <stef_> dev.perl.org
06:42:28 <lambdabot> set monads to http://www.abercrombiegroup.co.uk/~noel/research/monads.html http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/monads.html
06:42:55 <stef_> more specifically http://www.parrotcode.org/
06:42:58 <shapr> stef_: You probably want to learn about the Hindeley-Milner type inferencing algorithm
06:42:59 <Lilith> stef_: funky. thanks
06:43:10 <shapr> Hindley? Hindely?
06:43:19 <shapr> I can never remember that name.
06:43:20 <steveh> shapr: Hindley.
06:43:26 <shapr> steveh: thanks :-)
06:43:29 <stef_> shapr: any reference about type inference algorithms is welcome indeed.
06:43:36 <steveh> np, and good morning to you :)
06:43:42 <shapr> g'mornin steveh, wassup?
06:44:06 <steveh> not too much, reading about lambda calculus
06:44:10 <shapr> what do you think?
06:44:15 <Lilith> stef_: cool! i'll be working on the jvm myself
06:44:23 <shapr> have you tried playing with LC in the lambdabot plugin?
06:44:35 <steveh> it's slowly coming
06:44:38 <steveh> no I have not
06:44:41 <stef_> parrot will have continuation, coroutines and all that stuff. perl5 already has real closures
06:44:42 <steveh> what does it do?
06:45:01 <shapr> the @eval plugin is a lambda calculus interpreter
06:45:14 <steveh> what's the notation?
06:45:17 <shapr> I had some docs around here...
06:45:22 <shapr> @get-definition S
06:45:23 <lambdabot> S = \f g x.f x (g x)
06:45:24 <shapr> @get-definition K
06:45:25 <lambdabot> K = \x y.x
06:45:26 <shapr> @get-definition I
06:45:27 <lambdabot> I = \x.x
06:45:33 <steveh> aah
06:45:41 <steveh> that's just where I am in my book
06:45:44 <shapr> @eval (\x.x + 1) 1
06:45:45 <lambdabot> 2
06:46:03 <shapr> hej tic__
06:46:35 <shapr> yay, I got email from John Hughes
06:46:37 * shapr feels cool
06:46:37 <stef_> shapr: I was more interested in ML (because of the compiler book) but I was told at #sml that I would find more help here about that class of languages.
06:47:09 <shapr> stef_: you're not limited to just one at a time
06:47:14 <steveh> @eval (\x.x x) (\x.x x)
06:47:26 <lambdabot> out of fuel - use @resume to continue
06:47:34 <steveh> doh :)
06:47:57 <shapr> steveh: the @eval plugin has a max recursion limiter. Since lambdabot runs on my machine, I'm very happy about that.
06:48:09 <steveh> I can see that
06:48:19 <shapr> Darius wrote the @eval plugin
06:48:40 <shapr> hej Marvin--, I got two emails from John yesterday, I'm so cool :-)
06:48:57 <stef_> shapr: google is mute about Hindeley-Milner :(
06:49:08 <shapr> stef_: that's mostly because I can't spell.
06:49:34 <shapr> hindley milner
06:49:35 <stef_> oki: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=Hindley+Milner&spell=1
06:50:37 <stef_> shapr: where do I start?
06:51:01 <shapr> I dunno, I haven't studied HM directly.
06:51:13 <shapr> I'd suggest you look for a tutorial
06:51:16 <shapr> maybe there is one?
06:51:24 <shapr> I've seen an HM algorithm written in Perl
06:51:26 <steveh> probably not
06:51:42 <shapr> I would guess Perl is your native language, so that may appeal to you.
06:51:56 <cale> I tried to find a nice block of code implementing the algorithm - I found a big block of unreadable perl. Then again, I wasn't highly motivated.
06:51:56 <ChilliX> stef_: please excuse a naive question, why would knowledge about type checking/inference for languages with a polymorphic type system help with the implementation of a VM targetted at dynamically typed languages?
06:52:03 <steveh> here's what my otherwise comprehensive introduction to FP says:
06:52:29 <cale> Ah - seems to have been mentioned already :)
06:52:37 <shapr> I would like to see a simplistic implementation of HM in Haskell.
06:52:44 <cale> Yeah
06:52:46 <shapr> cale: do you remember the url for the Perl HM implementation?
06:52:51 <Marvin--> shapr: two mails? :) 'cause he forgot something in the first one? ;)
06:52:52 <shapr> hi ChilliX!
06:52:59 <cale> No, but I could probably find it again.
06:53:00 <ChilliX> Hi shapr
06:53:09 <steveh> "The reader interested in type inference fhould refer to [miln78] or [card85]... Chapters 8 and 9 of [peyt87] also give a good overview of this whole subject.
06:53:13 <steveh> let me resolve those references :)
06:53:20 <shapr> Marvin--: well, two subjects... I asked him about QuickCheckM and I wrote it again in Swedish for entertainment purposes.
06:53:41 <cale> http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~nikitab/courses/cs263/hm.pl
06:53:46 <shapr> Peyt87 could be either the "implementing" or the other one
06:53:49 <steveh> miln78: "Milner, R. A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming"
06:54:01 <stef_> ChilliX: in Perl6, you will be able to declarare typed variable. THe compiler will infer what it can, the rest will be dynamically typed
06:54:03 <cale> by Nikita Borisov - he went to my university - I'm fairly sure
06:54:15 <Marvin--> shapr: ah
06:54:16 <steveh> card85: Cardelli, L.  Basic Polymorphic Typechecking.
06:54:42 <steveh> peyt87: Peyton Jones, S. The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages
06:54:49 <shapr> Marvin--: I think he was entertained. Even more impressive, he corrected all my swedish in the reply :-)
06:55:03 <stef_> Chilli: so a programmer can start loosely and progressively constrain part or all of its program to get stricter interfaces/better performance
06:55:05 <cale> http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~nikitab/courses/cs263/hm.html
06:55:19 <Marvin--> shapr: hahaha
06:55:25 <Marvin--> shapr: cute :)
06:55:48 <ChilliX> stef_: what kind of type system do you have in mind?
06:56:20 <steveh> @eval \x y. x + y 3 5 
06:56:21 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
06:56:34 <steveh> parens issue?
06:56:35 <ChilliX> stef_: I am not sure whether you are aware that in a language like ML or Haskell, you usually don't have to declare types - they are all inferred by the compiler (very differnt from languages like C, Java, etc)
06:56:41 <shapr> steveh: I think so
06:56:50 <stef_> Chilix: It will stay an imperative language.
06:56:55 <steveh> @eval (\x y. x + y) 3 5 
06:56:55 <lambdabot> 8
06:57:00 <steveh> k :)
06:57:03 * Marvin-- looks at the half finished pentagram "tattoo" in black and red on his hand and observes "yep, we were drunk last night, all right"
06:57:09 <ChilliX> stef_: this has nothing to do with whether the langiage is imperative or not
06:57:25 <shapr> Marvin--: scary :-)
06:57:26 <ChilliX> stef_: it is a pure typing issue (in fact both ML and Haskell support imperative programming)
06:57:55 <Marvin--> shapr: a friend of mine got it into his head that he should give me a pentagram tattoo so he stole a pen from his girlfriend and started poking at me
06:58:02 <shapr> hah
06:58:03 <steveh> here's an interesting link:
06:58:04 <steveh> http://www.brics.dk/~mis/pascal.pdf
06:58:06 <stef_> I am here to learn about the problem space so I guess your question is beyond my knowledge :)
06:58:10 <steveh> type inference in turbo pascal
06:58:16 <ChilliX> stef_: the crucial property of these type systems is that every expression in a program has a unique type
06:58:22 <shapr> we should collect all these urls on the HaWiki
06:58:25 <steveh> I can't vouch for its utility or accuracy, just found it while browsing
06:58:44 <shapr> Marvin--: oh, he sent me this link: http://www.paris-tours-guides.com/index_swedish.htm
06:58:46 <steveh> the abstract looks spot-on for what stef_ is talking about though
06:59:01 <stef_> ChilliX: perl6 will have "ored" type meaning this var can be either a string or an int for example
06:59:13 <shapr> Marvin--: as part of the entertainment :-)
06:59:19 <stef_> steveh: what abstracts?
06:59:29 <ChilliX> stef_: the reason I am asking is because type systems are tricky beasts
06:59:44 <steveh> stef_: the abstract of the paper I just linked to
06:59:45 <steveh> http://www.brics.dk/~mis/pascal.pdf
06:59:57 <stef_> good
07:00:03 <ChilliX> stef_: so called type system with union types (which is what you described with strong or int) are quikcly undecidable
07:00:22 <steveh> "We argue that such a feature [type inference] may be of significant benefit for also [sic] standard imperative languages."
07:00:55 <ChilliX> stef_: in any case, two core references: (1) all you ever wanted to know about the Haskell type system and more is in http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/thih/thih-sep1-1999/ http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/thih/thih-sep1-1999/
07:01:07 <stef_> thx
07:01:11 <Smerdyakov> steveh, how odd. Danes who make English mistakes. :)
07:01:28 <Marvin--> shapr: WTF?!
07:01:30 <steveh> Smerdyakov: no big deal :)
07:01:46 <Smerdyakov> stefp, well, it's unusual in my experience!
07:01:47 <steveh> Smerdyakov: [sic] just means "I didn't make a transcription error here." :)
07:01:53 <Smerdyakov> I know
07:01:56 <ChilliX> stef_: and (2) the type system which is probably closest to what you want is described in http://www.research.avayalabs.com/user/wadler/topics/erlang.html http://www.research.avayalabs.com/user/wadler/topics/erlang.html
07:02:10 <steveh> their english is far better than my danish of course
07:02:17 <steveh> huzzah for hegemony
07:02:27 <ChilliX> (except that I pasted both URLS twice :-/
07:02:38 <ChilliX> (I guess, you can decipher it nevertheless)
07:02:51 <steveh> @eval \x.x dummyvar
07:02:52 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
07:03:36 <stefp> how come there is so many bright hackers in Australia? you are a nation of ex convicts and ex prostitutes after all. Hum just kidding/
07:03:48 <steveh> is there a way to /msg lambdabot these things to avoid spamming the channel? or does no one mind? :)
07:05:06 <Marvin--> steveh: it's /msg:able
07:05:09 <stefp> About: stef_: so called type system with union types (which is what you described with strong or int) are quikcly undecidable
07:05:28 <ChilliX> stefp: I am German btw ;-)
07:05:36 <stefp> :)
07:05:55 <shapr> Marvin--: what do you think of the swedish on that page?
07:06:01 <Marvin--> shapr: no? :)
07:06:14 <shapr> heh
07:06:17 <shapr> good answer
07:06:49 <Marvin--> "Veta vad du er sett för?"
07:06:49 <Marvin--> huh
07:07:05 <Marvin--> "Göra en rundresa, leda och tolkaren. Din på- lina skaffa i Paris för: ..."
07:07:05 <Marvin--> huh
07:07:11 <shapr> what about the famous cathredral "Notre Brud"
07:07:18 <dennisb> Wasn't Manuel Chakravarty in australia teaching haskell to 2000 students each year or something?
07:07:26 <stefp> ChilliX: this is one reaon why the compiler will gives its best short and that dynamic typing will be supported too. 
07:07:26 <shapr> dennisb: I heard something like that.
07:07:54 <Marvin--> LOL
07:08:02 <dennisb> shapr: I asked John once and he said so, must be correct
07:08:33 <Marvin--> "den Louvre"  hahaha
07:08:35 <ChilliX> stefp: the second link I posted is about a language called Erlang; it is dynamically typed, but the type system was designed to infer as much as possible and to revert to no static type info (= dynamic types) where needed
07:08:49 <shapr> y0 Arnia 
07:08:55 <Marvin--> this is killing me
07:09:10 <shapr> steveh: I'm the current admin of lambdabot, so if you have any problems with it, ask me.
07:09:20 <ChilliX> dennisb: 2000 students???
07:09:33 <saz> hehe
07:09:35 <Marvin--> "EN värma god dag till du och mig tack själv för besöka vår tomt!"
07:09:37 <shapr> ChilliX: hey, you're at unsw, do you know the actual figures?
07:09:54 * shapr grins
07:09:57 <Arnia> Hey shapr
07:10:01 <Marvin--> I mean...helloooooo
07:10:03 <ChilliX> saz: I wonder who did the inflation here...
07:10:13 <ChilliX> shapr: sure
07:10:21 <saz> ChilliX: no idea :-)
07:10:21 <shapr> ChilliX: you may even know the famous Manuel Chakravarty?
07:10:28 <stefp> ChilliX: anyway, the current specs of Perl6 are very skimmy about type inference
07:10:41 * shapr grins
07:11:11 <dennisb> ChilliX: I don't know, but surely John didn't lie to me, now would he :-)
07:11:30 <saz> hmmm.. 2000 comp1011 students.. that's a lot of casoc money for compsoc :)
07:11:40 <saz> *grin*
07:11:42 <Smerdyakov> casoc?
07:11:52 <ChilliX> dennisb: let's say, the number got slightly inflated; besides I only teach the intro course only one of the two times its taught
07:12:39 * saz wonders what the actual figures are
07:12:52 <ChilliX> dennisb: I guess in the year where we had the largest number of students, we weren't far away from 2000, but it was more like 1500
07:13:06 <dennisb> ChilliX: Hmm, how stupid am I? Didn't realize who ChilliX was :-)
07:13:10 <ChilliX> since then student numbers - thankfully!!! - dropped
07:13:11 * dennisb laughs
07:13:38 <Smerdyakov> What is "casoc"?
07:13:44 <cale> http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/boston-pm/2003-March/000798.html
07:13:46 <cale> heheh
07:14:03 <saz> Smerdyakov: oh, just the clubs and societies body at unsw, gives $1 for every student 
07:14:26 <shapr> yay, 60 clients
07:14:30 * shapr bounces happily
07:14:30 <ChilliX> this session, we have 500 students in this course and next session the prognosis is for about 300 something = 800 over the year
07:15:03 <saz> ChilliX: wow, i thought the figure was higher, but i guess the numbers have dropped all over
07:15:06 <ChilliX> last year it was 750 + 460 = 1210
07:15:36 <ChilliX> saz: enrollments went down about 30% this year
07:15:41 <saz> yeah
07:15:49 <shapr> that's a huge jump, what happened?
07:15:50 <Smerdyakov> ChilliX, why?
07:15:54 <socrates2> I am having prroblems with a haskell function, I am trying to cycle through a list and print a list of partial sums e.g. [1,2,3,4] would become [1,3,6,10], any ideas?
07:15:57 <Marvin--> dennisb: isn't it annoying when people don't put readable things in their whois info? :)
07:16:03 <saz> parents think that kids shouldn't do computing anymore
07:16:15 <ChilliX> saz: exactly that!
07:16:30 <saz> i was at the enrolment open day thing
07:16:39 <ChilliX> saz: ok :-)
07:16:57 <shapr> socrates2: what about using scanl or scanr?
07:16:58 <Smerdyakov> Good. There are too many morons choosing Computer Science as a default major when they want to be code monkeys.
07:17:19 <Marvin--> socrates2: should be easy with some simple recursion...
07:17:21 <saz> ChilliX: hopefully it translates to better students
07:17:27 <socrates2> no i only want to use lower level stuf
07:17:30 <ChilliX> the net result for us is a drop in part of the Schools budget, but it also makes teaching these courses more fun again and besides I expect that it's the not so interested students who stay away
07:17:50 <Marvin--> grmbl, why aren't they answering the phone at Strakt
07:18:00 <Marvin--> socrates2: lower level than recursion?
07:18:01 <saz> ChilliX: 1711 students are so different from 1011 students!

07:18:36 <ChilliX> stefp: btw, I assume the type inference you are talking about is in the Perl6 to Parrot compiler, not in Parrot itself
07:18:53 <socrates2> i dont know how to store the state, and get the running totals in a list.
07:18:56 <saz> shapr: some do, mine didn't

07:19:55 <shapr> and I'm a happy geek :-)
07:19:55 <Lilith> ChilliX: heh. ok 
07:20:12 <Marvin--> socrates2: you don't really need a state, start by thinking about the base case
07:20:17 <stefp> Chilli: yes, the usage is saying parrot for the implementation and perl6 for the language. That's a metonimy just like linux is. strictly speaking parrot is the VM.
07:20:37 <Lilith> i'm trying to morph my lambdas so it looks like 3D lambda smoke coming out of a coffee cup

07:21:43 <shapr> peut-etre c'est français?
07:21:49 <Marvin--> socrates2: a very easy case is to have partsum [] = [] right? Nothing to sum, no partial sums

07:22:40 <socrates2> how would u get all the part sums in a list?
07:22:41 <steveh> Bierce had nothing to say on the subject? Fascinating.

07:24:09 <stefp> because when one to speak about variables when he means value, he can be in a sloppy slope.
07:24:21 <shapr> je suis d'accord
07:24:51 <socrates2> partsum [x] = x 
07:24:54 <stefp> but if you are strict, you become difficult to read. tough choices

07:29:30 <shapr> y0 Mr Jones
07:29:42 <socrates2> Marvin--: partsum [x] = [x], partsum [x,y,z] = [x, x+y,x+y+z].
07:29:46 <cale> here's a perhaps silly way to do it: sums xs = map sum inits where inits = map (\n -> take n xs) [ 1 .. (length xs) ]
07:30:12 <socrates2> cale: thanks, but that looks crazy
07:30:25 <shapr> haven't seen Hal around lately, I hope that flu got better.
07:30:30 <Marvin--> socrates2: exactly, let's do a more general recursive step, partsum (x:xs) = ?
07:30:57 <socrates2> Marvin--: yeah
07:31:21 * steveh realizes he spelt "here" "hear" back then
07:31:24 <Marvin--> socrates2: so, given a list starting with an x, what should the first element in the partial sum?
07:31:27 <steveh> what the heck is wrong with me?
07:31:31 <Marvin--> er, in the first element of the list of partial sums
07:31:33 * steveh used to be a great speller.
07:31:39 <shapr> steveh: it's IRC
07:31:48 <Marvin--> shapr: d00d
07:31:48 <socrates2> Marvin--: x
07:31:51 <socrates2> [x]
07:32:08 <shapr> happens to me when I start to think faster than I type
07:32:12 <Marvin--> socrates2: yeah, and the $1000 question is, what's the rest of the list, and how can we create it, using 'partsum xs'? :)
07:32:22 <syntax-laptop> hi shapr :)
07:32:31 <Marvin--> socrates2: so you have partsum (x:xs) = x : something   where something should use partsum xs
07:32:50 <Marvin--> socrates2: do you know of the map function?
07:33:00 <socrates2> yeah
07:33:18 <Marvin--> cale: and 'inits' is a standard function in the List module
07:33:57 <Marvin--> socrates2: give it some thinking :-)
07:34:00 <socrates2> partsum (x:xs) = x : partsum xs 
07:34:34 <socrates2> yeah will thanks marvin
07:34:35 <Marvin--> ah, but then you'll just have the identity function
07:36:37 <socrates2> Marvin--: how can u use map
07:37:03 <Smerdyakov> You can read documentation.
07:37:08 <socrates2> because that would not take into account what had come b4 in the list.
07:37:39 <socrates2> Smerdyakov: map function l, i know that thanks
07:39:46 <socrates2> Marvin--: i am stumped
07:41:11 <Marvin--> socrates2: well, there's a nice pattern in your  partsum [x,y,z] = [x, x+y, x+y+z]  example, isn't there?
07:41:48 <Marvin--> I mean, you'd want partsum [y,z] to return [y, y+z] don't you? So given x and that partsum [y,z] = [y, y+z]  how would you construct  [x,x+y,x+y+z]?
07:42:37 <socrates2> yeah
07:43:47 <Marvin--> in the general case, [x,y,z] is (x:xs) so [y,z] is our xs
07:43:51 <socrates2> thats my question to
07:44:18 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, what materials are you using to learn Haskell?
07:44:31 <shapr> oy
07:44:48 <Marvin--> socrates2: I mean, given  [y, y+z]  it's quite easy to create [x+y, x+y+z]
07:45:22 <socrates2> i see yeah
07:46:45 <shapr> guten abend kosmikus 
07:46:59 <shapr> wie geht es?
07:48:27 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, what materials are you using to learn Haskell?
07:49:42 <socrates2> Smerdyakov: 12 dozen steps
07:49:45 <socrates2> rex page
07:49:58 <socrates2> Smerdyakov: why?
07:50:23 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, have you read all of it up to the point where this problem is posed?
07:51:26 <socrates2> Smerdyakov:shut up!
07:53:06 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, huh?
07:54:14 <socrates2> Smerdyakov: i dont need to be told to go away and read books.
07:54:36 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, you do if you haven't already read enough.... and you don't seem to want to say if you have!
07:55:32 <Smerdyakov> Which leads me to suspect that you haven't.
07:55:36 <cale> socrates2: do you want a spoiler?
07:55:54 <Smerdyakov> cale, I think that would be a bad idea.
07:56:56 <kosmikus> hi shapr
07:58:09 <socrates2> Smerdyakov: go drink some vodka
07:58:43 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, I think you need to realize that the people here are only willing to help people who have done their own part in considering their problems.
07:59:13 <Smerdyakov> socrates2, and that includes reading some text through to enough complexity that we don't have to introduce new ideas, just clarify them.
08:00:55 <kosmikus> is Peter Simons reachable via irc?

08:06:36 <kosmikus> FOP: the book is very interesting and looks beautiful; it is mainly a collection of older papers that have been reedited and partly rewritten for the book. It is very good to have them all in one place, though.

08:09:48 <Marvin--> eh?
08:10:16 <syntax-laptop> Darius: Thanks, both I think.
08:10:22 <shapr> kosmikus: yes, Peter Simons shows up here as peti

08:11:09 <Marvin--> ahh, right
08:11:10 <shapr> kosmikus: it would probably be faster to send him email
08:11:20 <Marvin--> probably "poor bastard" is in order, yes
08:11:40 <shapr> eh?
08:11:42 * shapr looks
08:12:05 <syntax-laptop> I think I'll be doing a lot of "send email... duck... peak out... duck..."
08:12:17 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: whoa awesome!
08:12:53 <syntax-laptop> :)
08:12:59 <shapr> yikes, I own haskell-libs ?
08:13:06 <Marvin--> well, I'm off to a barbecue
08:13:10 <syntax-laptop> l8r Marvin--
08:13:10 <Marvin--> see ya later
08:13:13 <shapr> cya Marvin-- 
08:14:13 <shapr> I'd say I try to organize stuff, and maintain the code that I get hold of
08:14:42 <syntax-laptop> who said you own haskell-libs?
08:14:48 <shapr> Peter Simons on libraries@
08:15:08 <shapr> I did start haskell-libs
08:15:11 <syntax-laptop> oh. I think you started the sf thing.
08:15:46 <shapr> even so, I'd say I own it as much (little) as I own this irc channel
08:16:04 <shapr> I just wash the coffee mugs ;-)
08:17:28 <shapr> what do you think of Peti's idea?
08:17:32 <Darius> shapr: you're also it's advertisement co.
08:17:39 <shapr> oh good point!
08:17:51 <shapr> I'm head of marketing for haskell-libs and #haskell
08:18:07 <shapr> Our profits are up 53% !
08:18:18 <shapr> Buy stock now while you still can!
08:19:04 <shapr> our stock symbol is \x->
08:19:11 <shapr> or maybe >>=
08:20:07 <shapr> syntax-laptop: is there a plan for the library infrastructure? what's the next step?
08:20:24 <syntax-laptop> shapr: for answers to your last two questions, read libraries@h.o :)
08:20:30 <shapr> ah ok
08:20:46 <syntax-laptop> Also: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LibraryInfrastructure
08:21:02 <shapr> darcs would be better for maintaining multiple private/public copies to do syncing
08:21:08 <shapr> better than cvs that is
08:21:26 <syntax-laptop> yeah, I was thinking that darcs would be cool for this project, esp in an eat-your-own-dogfood type way.
08:21:52 <shapr> yah, that's a good point
08:21:57 <syntax-laptop> and I suspect that it would be better to host it at haskell.org than on sf, since it seems to want to be quasi-official, but I didn't talk about that.
08:22:09 <shapr> I would agree with you there.
08:22:11 <syntax-laptop> but sf would be good for the quasi-unofficial stuff :)
08:22:16 <shapr> yah exactly
08:22:17 <syntax-laptop> esp for orphened libraries.
08:22:31 <shapr> right, that's the real point of haskell-libs, to be unofficial
08:22:46 <syntax-laptop> btw, any luck tracking down the author of the numeric-quest stuff?
08:22:47 <shapr> Peter Simons suggested haskell-libs as a halfway point
08:22:53 <shapr> no, I have no clue
08:23:15 <shapr> I've tried tracing via address, via old domain name info, and I still have nothing.
08:23:19 <syntax-laptop> sucks.  well at least from now on, things like this won't happen! (he said with resolve)

08:57:20 <shapr> I've heard the overhead becomes irritating only when you go past four
08:57:38 <shapr> preempt really helps
08:57:44 <jlouis> probable, I've never tried to run Linux on our 24-way sparc
08:57:49 <Lilith> shapr: yeah. i think that's true
08:58:15 <Lilith> feah
08:58:17 <Lilith> this sucks
08:59:07 <Lilith> i don't think i have enough disk space on my own machine
08:59:15 <shapr> how much do you have?
08:59:30 <Lilith> 12 Gig on my laptop
08:59:42 <jlouis> heh, that is a lot
08:59:46 <shapr> you just want to build GHC, right?
08:59:49 <Lilith> a fair bit have been used
09:00:04 <Lilith> yeh. and use it
09:00:16 * Lilith is trying to keep everything in one place
09:00:18 <Lilith> hmm
09:00:22 <shapr> lemee see how much a full fptools tree takes
09:00:24 <Lilith> older version of gcc
09:00:24 <shapr> 93mb
09:00:43 <shapr> that's for ghc, hslibs, everything
09:00:57 <jlouis> hum, you might be happy with 12Gig of ram for Haskell, though that is another side of the story
09:01:03 <shapr> sources only
09:01:16 <Lilith> yeah
09:01:22 <Lilith> i heard it can take ages to build
09:01:27 <Lilith> like 4 hours :)
09:01:35 <shapr> more than that
09:01:52 <Lilith> was 4 hours on an itanium box
09:01:54 <shapr> oh
09:02:04 <Lilith> i guess it'd be more on my laptop
09:02:12 <Lilith> my laptop's fairly old :)
09:02:20 <shapr> it takes several hours on my dual 1.5GHz
09:02:24 <shapr> I don't remember how many
09:04:25 <jlouis> Itanium is slow probably
09:04:33 <jlouis> yet it takes ages
09:05:44 <Igloo> Lilith: That's a known problem, you could revert the change to fix it
09:05:46 <shapr> I wish make -j2 would work for GHC
09:06:09 <Lilith> Igloo: it's in the archives somewhere? 
09:06:21 <shapr> of course, I could report the dependency errors and someone would fix it ....
09:06:33 <Lilith> *grin*
09:07:48 <Igloo> Lilith: There should be a recent message to cvs-ghc when Simon M made the large file commit which will show you which files he changed, so you'd want to get the previous versions of those files
09:08:19 <Lilith> Igloo: ok. thanks
09:09:54 <jlouis> There is no sparc64 generation in ghc?
09:10:33 <jlouis> hugs wors well though ;)
09:11:09 <shapr> hi firstein__
09:12:06 <Igloo> Oh, actually, it looks like a fix might just have been committed
09:18:08 <shapr> hi CowGirl 
09:18:14 <CowGirl> hey
09:18:51 <shapr> what's up?
09:19:12 <CowGirl> not much,  i bought a linux cd
09:19:16 <CowGirl> has mandrake...
09:19:23 <CowGirl> 9.0
09:19:29 <CowGirl> and red hat 8.0
09:19:34 <shapr> cool, have you installed it on your other drive?
09:19:37 <CowGirl> which would be better to install??
09:19:40 <Smerdyakov> Debian!
09:19:45 <shapr> I'd suggest mandrake
09:20:04 <shapr> Smerdyakov: debian is a bit harder to install for new users of linux.
09:20:14 <CowGirl> not yet,  dont have the time at the moment....will try in a few weeks.,.also may reinstall windows on the other drive
09:20:39 <Lilith> shapr: i don't know that's exactly true any more
09:20:43 <CowGirl> format it, just so there are no errors in windows, then install linux
09:20:51 <Lilith> no fancy pansy graphics for sure, but it's not that difficult
09:21:22 <CowGirl> i still got to update my bios, that 10 gig hard drive where i only get 8 is frustrating
09:21:32 <CowGirl> but i cant seem to get my motherboard type
09:21:49 <CowGirl> i downloaded a program thatr should detect it, but it doesnt...and i cant see it at startup
09:21:50 <Lilith> CowGirl: you should have gone to the recent linux installfest at uni
09:21:56 <CowGirl> any other way to get it
09:22:03 <CowGirl> yeah i know, i read about that 
09:22:06 <CowGirl> but i had to work!!
09:22:13 <CowGirl> last weekend right?
09:22:13 <Lilith> bummer
09:22:15 <Lilith> yes
09:22:28 * Darius reading the sample chapter FoP, by Chris Okasaki!, and believes [127] is a citation...
09:22:36 <CowGirl> saw that...i have a laptop so it would have been easy. 
09:22:49 <CowGirl> how can i get my motherboard type??
09:23:04 <Smerdyakov> Darius, why does he get an exclamation mark, and what else would a bracketed number be? =)
09:23:05 <CowGirl> i downloaded that small exe file i found on the net a few times
09:23:06 <shapr> google for the model of your laptop, then look for technical info
09:23:18 <CowGirl> its in german though!
09:23:22 <CowGirl> ok...i'll try that
09:23:24 <Lilith> Darius: what's FoP?
09:23:48 <Darius> Smerydyakov: I like what I've read by Chris Okasaki
09:23:49 <CowGirl> would they have changed the motherboard though thru production of my type for any reason??
09:23:53 <Darius> Fun of Programming
09:23:57 <CowGirl> see gateway in australia has shutdown
09:24:12 <CowGirl> so its hard to get info,  i tried their site, but it wont accept my customer id
09:24:19 <Lilith> is it available online?
09:24:22 * Lilith hunts
09:24:30 <CowGirl> i think my warranty is up, so i guess thats why
09:26:11 <Lilith> there might be specs somewhere though
09:26:36 <CowGirl> yeah, but it asked for my customer id to get in
09:26:37 <Lilith> or if you kept all the manuals that came with your laptop
09:26:58 <Lilith> they'd probably have listings
09:27:09 <CowGirl> i got the manuals....but i moved recently, got no chance of finding them
09:27:58 <Lilith> "The fun of programming edited by Jeremy Gibbons and Oege de Moor"
09:28:04 <Lilith> Darius: is that the one?
09:28:17 <Lilith> ah
09:28:19 <Lilith> :))
09:28:53 <jlouis> Darius: indeed
09:29:11 <Lilith> ooh
09:29:20 <Lilith> origami programming. that sounds funky
09:29:37 <jlouis> Darius: Okasaki... could you give a link to that part?
09:30:18 <CowGirl> shapr, with updating bios and the extra 2 gig that i have....u said i may have to partition it?? it wont just detect it?
09:30:46 <Darius> http://www.palgrave.com/catalogue/catalogue.asp?Title_Id=0333992857
09:33:07 * ChilliX yawns.
09:33:41 <ChilliX> 1st version of Erlang assignment done: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9243/assigns/ass2/
09:33:49 <Lilith> yay!
09:33:53 <ChilliX> now my bed calls *very* loudly
09:33:56 <Lilith> :)
09:34:08 <ChilliX> Lilith: maybe you should sleep, too ;-)
09:34:09 <shapr> CowGirl: updating the BIOS still may not give you access to the extra space
09:34:15 <ChilliX> 'night
09:34:19 <Lilith> ChilliX: i slept earlier. goodnight :)
09:34:21 <shapr> g'night ChilliX
09:34:24 <ChilliX> Lilith: ic
09:34:38 <Lilith> ChilliX: are you going to order "the fun of programming"? :))
09:34:50 <ChilliX> Lilith: got a copy on my desk
09:34:56 <Lilith> oooh
09:34:57 <ChilliX> you are welcome to borrow it
09:35:00 <CowGirl> shapr, if that doesnt work, any other reason u know of to dectect it??
09:35:05 <Lilith> ChilliX: thanks! :))
09:35:43 <shapr> CowGirl: get a new computer and put in your old harddrive.
09:35:59 <ChilliX> (haven't looked at it much yet - so many other things too read; just drop in and get it whenever you like)
09:36:16 * ChilliX -> bed
09:36:44 <CowGirl> so in other words im up shit creek with only 8 gigs.....
09:36:58 <CowGirl> cant afford new comp at the moment
09:37:00 <Lilith> ChilliX: cool! goodnight :)
09:40:05 <Lilith> CowGirl: how many gigs do you plan to leave for linux/windows?
09:40:24 <CowGirl> what u mean??
09:40:43 <CowGirl> the min is like 2mb for linux right??
09:40:59 <shapr> CowGirl: you have two drives, right?
09:42:37 <CowGirl> yeah,  both are removable...dont work together
09:42:47 <shapr> oh
09:42:52 <CowGirl> one is 4 gig, the new one is 10 gig
09:42:59 <CowGirl> but the new one only detects 8 gig
09:43:27 <CowGirl> yeah, sorry, they dont work together,  the are both removable....only can use one at a time
09:43:45 <shapr> You could install Linux on the 4 gig drive
09:44:28 <Lilith> but they don't work together
09:44:30 <Lilith> hmm
09:44:49 <Lilith> 8 Gigs should be enough for windows and linux to coexist
09:45:22 <Lilith> so long as you're not building compilers and stuff *cackles*
09:45:41 <CowGirl> its just the fact that there is 10 gigs there, but it only detects 8....and my computer is lagging more than ever...
09:45:44 <Darius> I had SuSE smashed into a GB or less
09:45:57 <shapr> CowGirl: the extra space won't change the amount of lag
09:45:59 <Darius> once, I just made loopback files in the Windows partition to build
09:46:15 <CowGirl> i need to update memory, i have 64mb...last time i updated memory it ran faster
09:46:20 <CowGirl> not much
09:46:24 <CowGirl> but noticeable
09:47:07 <CowGirl> i know i need a new comp, but i cant for a while...this one cost an arm and a leg, so im stuck with it...just trying to improve it anyway possible
09:48:03 <shapr> You could buy a desktop computer, they're much cheaper.
09:48:09 <shapr> cheaper than laptops.
09:49:41 <CowGirl> thought of trying to build my own
09:50:05 <Lilith> actually it wouldn't cost a great deal more to get a ready made customised one
09:50:32 <Lilith> you should go down to the computer fair at uni to compare prices
09:51:06 <Lilith> or depending on where you live, compare prices at the computer shops near you
09:52:19 <Lilith> if you're not getting the newest of everything, a brand new system would cost somewhere between $500 and $1000
09:52:31 <shapr> Lilith: is that AUD?
09:52:35 <Lilith> shapr: yes
09:52:44 <shapr> ok
09:53:05 <CowGirl> i'll look around...just kinda attached to the laptop :)
09:53:20 <Lilith> hehe. :)
09:53:23 <CowGirl> handy to be able to use it anywhere
09:53:47 <Lilith> i'm attached to  mine too, although my dad offered to trade it in for another one
09:53:54 <CowGirl> took it with me when i moved overseas a few years ago....  
09:54:08 <CowGirl> nice to sit up in bed with it....cant do that with a desktop
09:54:13 <shapr> I just took my hard drives when I changed continents.
09:54:47 <Lilith> i got a laptop when i changed continents :)
09:54:59 <shapr> maybe I should try that.
09:55:28 <shapr> I totally love the case of my computer, I'll keep using it if future motherboards still fit.
09:57:23 <CowGirl> what time u go to sleep lilith?
09:57:37 <CowGirl> usually?
09:57:50 <Lilith> uhm. usually?
09:58:00 <Lilith> give me a time frame
09:58:18 <shapr> We all know Lilith lives on a 27 hour cycle.
09:58:26 <CowGirl> on an average week night...??
09:58:37 * Lilith grins at shapr 
09:58:40 <Lilith> i wish!
09:58:58 <CowGirl> i was going to sleep at 6am every night a few weeks ago,....i couldnt do  it no more
09:59:06 <steveh> my brain is imploding
09:59:08 <CowGirl> do u have to get up and do something tomorrow??
09:59:11 <Lilith> CowGirl: oh. i meant like from which month, year etc
09:59:19 <CowGirl> i mean, can u sleep during the day then??
09:59:20 <Lilith> to which month, year etc
09:59:23 <Lilith> yeah
09:59:38 <Lilith> well, it depends
09:59:41 <Lilith> if i've got work, no
09:59:42 <CowGirl> how many hours u sleep in a day (24hrs)?
09:59:55 <Lilith> it depends :)
10:00:06 <shapr> steveh: question I can help yo uwith?
10:00:07 <CowGirl> some people are able to handle it....im not one of them!
10:00:33 <Lilith> CowGirl: well, some days i sleep 10-12 hours
10:00:37 <Lilith> some days i sleep less
10:00:46 <CowGirl> i should be asleep now, but got to get notes....
10:00:54 <CowGirl> u feel the effects of not enough sleep??
10:01:18 <steveh> shapr: in pure lambda calculus, what would a conditional look like?
10:01:25 * Darius somedays sleeps 10-12 hours, -most- days -much- less.
10:01:48 <CowGirl> when i was only sleeping 2-3 hrs a night a few weeks ago, i got so bad, i was forgetting the simplest everyday things
10:02:04 <Lilith> CowGirl: yeah. that happens :)
10:02:08 <Darius> @get-definition lcIf

10:02:54 <lambdabot> chFalse = \x y. y
10:03:38 <Arnia> shapr: Are you available to look over some arrows stuff for me to check my reasoning?
10:03:49 <steveh> but how then would you generate appropriate functions to give you lcTrue and lcFalse given some other input?
10:04:01 <steveh> for example a pure lc definition of <
10:04:24 <jlouis> Church numerals first?
10:04:34 <CowGirl> speaking of sleep, i think im due for it now....night all!
10:04:36 <steveh> oh ho ho
10:04:50 <steveh> that helped jlouis
10:04:59 <jlouis> ;)
10:05:20 <shapr> Arnia: sure, though I'm not convinced I'm clueful enough to help you.
10:05:45 <steveh> my issue is I don't have a comprehensive book on the subject
10:05:53 <steveh> cobbling it together from a couple of textbooks
10:06:16 <shapr> Arnia: send it to me by email?
10:06:23 <steveh> one is committed to teaching Haskell and the other mentions "other formalisms" in passing compared to the space given FSMs, CFLs and TMs.
10:06:37 <Arnia> Address?
10:06:48 <shapr> shae at Scanned In Avian dot com
10:07:12 <Lilith> shapr: that's a deliberate pun?
10:07:48 <shapr> Given my somber and focussed demeanor, what do you think?
10:08:14 <Arnia> Scanned in Avian as one word?
10:08:17 <shapr> yup
10:08:35 <shapr> Lilith: my last name is also a joke btw.
10:09:24 <Lilith> shapr: well, i can't see your demeanor ;)

10:12:55 <Lilith> non of my online pics are good :)
10:13:03 <shapr> do you have any?
10:13:11 <Lilith> yeah
10:13:16 <shapr> I wanna see!
10:13:32 <Lilith> most of them i just junk (thank god for digicams ;))

10:14:55 <shapr> cool!
10:15:27 <Lilith> that was an attempt to take a self portrait with my digicam 
10:15:52 <shapr> looks nice to me.
10:16:31 <Lilith> heh thanks
10:16:49 * Lilith prefers pictures of herself to be taken from a distance
10:17:03 <Lilith> and preferably focussed on the surroundings
10:17:10 <shapr> heh
10:17:41 <shapr> well, this way I'll recognize you when I see you at one of the Geek Meetings
10:18:01 <shapr> and you'll recognize me too!
10:20:58 <shapr> Arnia: what's a "wrapping SF" ?
10:21:30 <Arnia> shapr: A signal function that uses that signal function
10:21:39 <shapr> ah
10:21:49 <Arnia> shapr: loadFromProtocol is a wrapping SF of loadRequest
10:22:22 <Lilith> shapr: hehe :)
10:30:31 <Lilith> g'night all
10:30:38 <shapr> g'night Lilith 
10:37:30 <shapr> Arnia: I have a bunch of half-formed thoughts I got from reading this code...
10:37:54 <shapr> Hi Esa
10:38:04 <shapr> application arrow is nifty
10:38:07 <esap> Hi.
10:38:22 * shapr thinks
10:38:37 <shapr> Arnia: what's ArrowLoop?
10:38:40 <shapr> is that in Fruit?
10:38:52 <Arnia> shapr: Its a typeclass in the Arrow system
10:38:56 <shapr> oh
10:39:30 <Arnia> shapr: used to do recursion... defines a function loop :: Arrow a => a (b,d) (c,d) -> a b c
10:40:37 <Arnia> shapr: I'm going to change the system to use the same type for both incoming requests and outgoing... I'll also add a check to make sure that the incoming request isn't an error
10:40:49 <Arnia> Other than that, you like?
10:40:53 <shapr> I like
10:41:17 <Arnia> It was the best way I could find to get IO actions out into the world
10:41:19 <shapr> I think it has some similarities to Esa's OOArrow code.
10:41:53 * esap almost thought you were talking about my code :-)
10:42:17 * esap would be hugely surprised.
10:42:42 <shapr> esap: Arnia and I have been discussing an arrow based application framework
10:42:57 <esap> shapr: what kind of framework?
10:43:25 <shapr> sort of like J2EE/Zope, but not specifically for the web, for general apps
10:43:39 <Arnia> esap: Something to make coding real world apps with various user interfaces relatively painless
10:44:41 <shapr> Arnia: should call it the Postlude =)
10:44:52 <Arnia> Postlude is a cool name :)
10:46:41 <cale> I wonder what problems might be caused if function application was a bit sneakier and instead of only allowing exact matching in the case of function types it allowed for maximal overlap, and threw in extra parameters if needed. i.e. if f :: a->a->a->b->c->d and g :: e->f->a->a->a, then f g :: e -> f -> b -> c ->d
10:48:44 <Arnia> I also want to define Haskell native widgets for GUIs and common paradigms like an equivalent to MVC
10:49:11 <shapr> Isn't the gui list already doing that?
10:49:24 <shapr> I haven't kept up with that list, the traffic was too high for me.
10:49:32 <Arnia> shapr: Where is that list?
10:49:37 <shapr> gui@haskell.org
10:49:50 <Arnia> Thanks... I'm off for food now. Speak later
10:50:30 <cale> does anyone know what I'm talking about?
10:51:00 <esap> cale: to me, what you say doesn't make sense unless g :: e -> f -> (a,a,a).
10:51:03 <shapr> cale: I think I have a vague idea, but I'd like to hear more to be sure I understand.
10:53:14 * esap has been thinking about generalizations of function application. There is quite much you could do to generalize it.
10:53:23 <shapr> Like what?
10:53:49 <cale> so when you pass a function as a parameter to another function, say g is passed as a parameter to f, instead of matching the first bit of the type of f against the type of g, it matches the first bit of the type of f against all the tails of the type of g, and leaves the start of the type of g as extra params.
10:54:32 <cale> so that say you had a function getList :: Integer -> [Integer]
10:54:59 <esap> shapr: Well, first you could consider app :: f a -> Dual f -> a
10:55:16 <shapr> cale: sounds like (g . f) to me
10:55:24 <cale> Yeah.
10:56:50 <cale> Pretty much - basically, when function application would normally produce a type error in this case, instead we get a sort of composition.
10:57:28 <esap> shapr: another thing about function application is that function application is really the same as substitution with the exception that function application is associative. You could generalize this to allow attaching other properties than associativity to substitution.
10:58:19 <ludde> I need to make a small project that is related to computer languages. Any suggestions?
10:58:48 <shapr> esap: how is function application associative?
10:59:17 <cale> so that say f :: String -> Int -> Int -> Int and g :: Int -> Int -> [Int], then f g :: String -> Int -> [Int]
10:59:26 <cale> umm....
10:59:36 <cale> g f rather
11:00:04 <ludde> In the past, people have
11:00:04 <ludde> prototyped an idea from a paper, sketched the design of a language for
11:00:04 <ludde> a special application, or whatever. You are free to choose any project
11:00:04 <ludde> you like, with a connection to languages.
11:00:32 <shapr> ludde: write a useful syntax for commutative monads?
11:00:45 <esap> shapr: f (g x) == (f . g) x   and (f x) y == f (x,y)
11:01:01 <ludde> shapr: what is that
11:01:10 <esap> shapr: you could say that it's not the same operation, but well :-)
11:01:11 <ludde> shapr: I have to write 3-5 pages about the project
11:01:30 <shapr> ludde: http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/retro/img36.html http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/retro/img37.html
11:02:34 <Darius> composition is associative application isn't. f (g x) /= (f g) x
11:02:52 <esap> darius: oh did I get it backwards :-)
11:04:03 <shapr> ludde: maybe write a language that's defined in terms of S and K, but allows for testably equivalent SuperCombinators?
11:04:19 <ludde>  testably equivalent SuperCombinators, what's that
11:04:37 <shapr> You'd get functions as an instance of Eq and Ord also, though I don't know what use that is...
11:05:00 <shapr> http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?SuperCombinators
11:05:39 <ludde> i'm not too deep into lambda calculus though
11:06:24 <ludde> also, it's due on sunday
11:06:38 <shapr> actually, you could easily write a transmeta-style optimizing layer for a language that allowed introspection into the (super)combinators comprising each function.
11:06:42 <ludde> i thought about making a language for sound synthesis
11:06:48 <shapr> that would be cool!
11:07:22 <esap> shapr, darius: Oh actually, the idea was that function application somehow "includes" the concept of associativity in the sense that the representation for both (f . (g . h)) x === ((f . g) . h) x is the same if you write it with function application: (f (g (h x))), and therefore there is no need to handle the associativity separately.
11:07:31 <ludde> but i don't know how to implement integration, that is needed by quite a lot of sound stuff.. and AFRP doesn't support time rescaling which I want.
11:07:48 <shapr> I think it does support time rescaling
11:07:55 <ludde> shapr: oh, how?
11:08:12 <shapr> I'm positive one of the Yampa papers specifically discusses that.
11:08:32 <ludde> I just looked briefly through the source code.
11:09:00 <shapr> I think they also implement integration on Signal Functions in one of the papers.
11:09:26 <ludde> yes integration is implemented.
11:09:27 <ludde> in AFRP
11:10:40 <shapr> iirc, one of the papers says they can only rescale signals that are using discrete time, not continuous time.
11:10:55 <shapr> hi firstein_
11:10:56 <ludde> alright
11:11:01 <ludde> that's not quite what I want.
11:11:22 <shapr> Well, I could have it backwards, you should check the papers to make sure.
11:11:23 <Riastradh> Hi.
11:11:27 <shapr> hi Riastradh!
11:11:35 * shapr explats
11:11:51 * Riastradh notes SSAX on Bigloo is faster than expat.
11:12:50 <Darius> ludde, I don't know how good AFRP would be for this.  The -objects- of your language would be signal functions, I don't think your code would have a signal function structure. (Or maybe I'm thinking of something else)
11:13:40 <Darius> (er objects are signals)
11:13:51 <Darius> perhaps a EDSL over AFRP
11:14:26 <Darius> hmm, or maybe it would be.
11:14:33 <Darius> Depends on what you are going for.
11:15:39 <ludde> I want to be able to write stuff like "integrate (rescale 10 sinus)"
11:16:05 <ludde> hmm
11:16:10 <ludde> I could make an equation solver
11:16:11 <ludde> is that hard?
11:16:43 <esap> equation solver is basically the same as an unification algorithm.
11:17:01 <ludde> I don't know what a unification algorithm is though
11:18:21 <esap> ludde: the unification algorithm is what causes all those "Cannot unify the type-signature variable..." errors in GHC :-)
11:18:42 <ludde> damn i'm desperate, i need to find something!
11:18:51 <ludde> I could make a language to control a web crawler
11:20:19 <ludde> I could make an IRC bot :)
11:22:28 * Darius wonders if the wiki Haskell IRC page should be updated from "averaging 40" to 50
11:23:01 <shapr> yah yah!
11:23:05 <Darius> or maybe "... 50, eat that #ocaml"
11:23:16 * shapr laugsh
11:23:28 <Riastradh> #scheme only has an average of about 30...awww...
11:28:39 <steveh> Riastradh: because scheme is so intuitive no one needs help ;)
11:28:41 * steveh ducks.
11:29:06 * Riastradh gives steveh a cookie.
11:48:51 <shapr> Darius: Re: "overkill is good" hah
12:03:20 <shapr> LocalSiteMap is a spiffy MoinMoin feature
12:03:25 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LibraryInfrastructure?action=LocalSiteMap
12:04:54 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: cool.
12:06:51 <shapr> moin moin rocks
12:12:52 <Riastradh> Is there a Go GUI for OS X?
12:14:08 <Riastradh> i.e., one with which one can play with two humans or a human and a bot or a human and a human over the internet or a human and a bot over internet.
12:15:03 <Riastradh> And is there a way to match either of two different constructors in a single 'case' clause?
12:15:14 <Smerdyakov> There is in SML/NJ. ;-)
12:15:16 <Riastradh> e.g., like:    Foo | Bar -> ...
12:15:23 * Riastradh is using Haskell, though, foo.
12:15:42 <Riastradh> Can you do:  Foo x | x > 3 => ...   in SML?
12:15:57 <Riastradh> ...and have it only evaluate the ... when x > 3, of course.
12:16:05 <Smerdyakov> Nein!
12:16:05 <Riastradh> Zigackly!
12:16:12 <Riastradh> Take that, SML!
12:16:44 * SyntaxPolice kicks SML
12:17:15 <SyntaxPolice> Riastradh: I 'spect that the Go GUI you seek would be written in Java and called Cgoban, no?
12:17:34 <Riastradh> SyntaxPolice, er, I'm not looking for one in specific.
12:17:45 <Riastradh> Is this Java one using ordinary Java GUI stuff or Cocoa Java GUI stuff?
12:19:19 <SyntaxPolice> Riastradh: I don't know.  You can maybe find out here: http://kgs.kiseido.com/en_US/download.html
12:19:30 <SyntaxPolice> Riastradh: I know that the old version had a way to play against the computer, I don't know if the new version does.
12:22:19 <Darius> shapr: how has your getting MoinMoin to highlight Haskell gone, as that would make HaskellIrcPastePage kick ass?
12:23:18 <shapr> well, from what I've heard it's really easy, just need to add the enscript macro into moin's lib dir, and point it to the enscript binary
12:24:12 <shapr> I've been meaning to do it locally and then mail directions to the HaWiki maintainer, but I haven't gotten that far
12:24:58 <Riastradh> Hmm.  Does anyone here use this 'KGS' Go thing?
12:29:18 <Riastradh> ...
12:30:22 <Smerdyakov> King Go Says: go to your room
12:31:05 <cale> I use kgs
12:31:26 <cale> Though I haven't played there in a while.
12:31:54 * Riastradh just learned how to play this morning and should like to try a game.
12:32:23 <Smerdyakov> Does the game have to be Go?
12:32:30 <Riastradh> Er, yes.
12:32:42 <shapr> I've played once.
12:32:58 <Riastradh> Are you busy right now, shapr?
12:33:15 <shapr> not really
12:33:32 <Riastradh> We're about even, too -- one isn't that far from zero -- want to play a game?
12:33:42 <shapr> sure
12:33:58 * shapr looks for a 'net board
12:34:01 * Riastradh is Riastradh on KGS.  (it's so great how his nick is totally unique and no one else ever uses it!)
12:34:20 <Smerdyakov> So what. My first + last name are unique, as far as I know. :-)
12:35:21 <shapr> me too!
12:35:33 <Riastradh> That's because you made yours up, shapr.
12:35:37 <shapr> well, yes.
12:35:39 <Riastradh> Cheater.
12:35:48 <shapr> Hey, it's in the rules.
12:36:18 <stefp> Oh Oh, go players around...
12:36:29 <shapr> um, I have cgoban
12:36:32 <Riastradh> There are also lots of laws designed for disgusting, cheating Capitalist pigs.
12:36:35 <shapr> it uses IGS or NNGS
12:37:01 * Riastradh is using cgoban, too, and he's connected to KGS.
12:37:10 <stefp> I use the C based cgoban and I am happy with it.
12:37:28 <Riastradh> This is Cgoban 2, apparently.
12:38:01 <shapr> I have cgoban 1.9
12:38:07 <stefp> I use cgoban  1.9.12
12:38:08 <Riastradh> Update?
12:38:19 <shapr> it's the only cgoban deb I can see
12:38:37 <shapr> wait, cgoban 2 is written in Java, yah?
12:38:42 <stefp> In one occurence, I was unable to sync with someone using ggo.
12:38:45 <Riastradh> Yes, shapr.
12:38:48 <shapr> oh
12:38:52 <shapr> Java sucks.
12:38:53 <shapr> :-)
12:39:00 * shapr grins
12:39:04 <Riastradh> OK, suggest a better Go client.
12:39:21 <shapr> I dunno
12:39:29 <shapr> we could always write a lambdabot plugin ;-)
12:39:36 <Riastradh> Or give in and use Java.  At least you aren't using C# and .NET!
12:40:09 <stefp> I have alway trouble with Java on my linux box.
12:40:17 <stefp> So much for portability.
12:40:28 <shapr> yah, me too
12:40:44 <shapr> xgospel seems to want to talk to IGS also
12:40:51 * Riastradh doesn't advocate Java either.
12:41:03 <stefp> what's the problem with cgoban 1.9?
12:41:04 <Riastradh> Will CGoban 1.9 or xgospel run on OS X?
12:41:07 <shapr> Riastradh: can you connect to IGS?
12:42:26 <stefp> what is you level guys, I started playing recently after many years and ranked myself 15 kyu but apparently was too optimitic
12:42:26 <Riastradh> Ah, here's one.
12:42:37 * Riastradh just learned how to play this morning.
12:42:43 <shapr> I've played *one time*
12:42:54 <shapr> one single game
12:43:02 <Riastradh> We're thus about even.
12:43:04 <shapr> so I have a vague idea of the rules
12:43:21 <stefp> the rules are easy, the game is subtil.
12:43:56 <Riastradh> Subtle.
12:44:06 <stefp> Not like chess, with the scenario is already written. Each army trying to kill the opposite king.
12:44:17 <stefp> English spelling is subtle to me.
12:44:22 <shapr> yah, like procedural versus functional :-)
12:45:02 <Darius> What really sucks is not only Java the language sucks, but from what I hear the JVM isn't very general.  Writing backends for languages  that don't exactly fit the Java mold is supposed to be very not fun.
12:45:30 <Darius> Lilith, could probably say a thing or to about that
12:45:38 <stefp> That's why the Perl folks are writing Yet Another VM.
12:46:11 <Darius> Will it be a Perl VM or something that is meant to be a universal VM?
12:46:19 * Darius hasn't read too much about Parrot
12:47:00 <stefp> It is supposed to be an universal VM. But performance-wise it will be geared toward Perl6
12:47:27 <shapr> Riastradh: IGS?
12:47:47 <stefp> I try to interest people outside the Perl crowd because there is plenty to play for other people who can bring value
12:48:03 * Riastradh is trying to, shapr.
12:48:09 <shapr> ok :-)
12:48:30 <shapr> stefp: can you bring some Perl people in here too? ;-)
12:48:48 <shapr> they might enjoy les logicielle fonctionelle
12:49:11 <shapr> Yes, I know my spelling is pretty bad.
12:49:24 <stefp> I think the desing team has read a lot about it if they don't mention it not to scare the Perl crowd
12:49:37 <shapr> ?
12:49:44 <Riastradh> How am I supposed to register?
12:49:53 <shapr> the "register" command
12:49:58 <shapr> I'm a guest too
12:50:06 <Riastradh> But my nick is a guest nick and I can't register that.
12:50:11 <Riastradh> How do I register 'Riastradh?'
12:51:12 <shapr> I dunno
12:51:19 <shapr> help register
12:51:51 <cale> choose register from the menu
12:52:42 <shapr> it seems I can only register the username I am currentyl logged in with
12:52:54 <cale> User -> Register - if you're talking about KGS. Yes, that's true.
12:53:06 * Riastradh registers on the web.
12:53:10 <Riastradh> cale, no, now we're using IGS.
12:53:22 <cale> ah
12:53:54 <cale> hmm... I don't think I have an account on IGS yet.
12:53:59 <shapr> aha, http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/register/
12:54:04 <cale> I only log in to watch games.
12:54:38 <shapr> what's my initial rank?
12:54:54 <shapr> 1d-6d 1k-26k
12:54:56 <shapr> ?
12:55:33 <Riastradh> OK, I'm Riastradh there now.
12:55:43 <shapr> what's the lowest rank?
12:55:45 <Riastradh> (yeah, I found that URI a couple minutes ago)
12:55:54 <Riastradh> I think 28k.
12:55:58 <Riastradh> (in IGS)
12:56:02 <shapr> ok
12:56:11 * esap is 'esap' at IGS.
12:56:38 * shapr waits for email
12:56:50 <Riastradh> It came pretty quickly for me.
12:57:43 <shapr> yayERC> 
12:57:45 <shapr> oops
12:57:51 <Riastradh> Heh.
12:58:48 <shapr> what's the rules again?
12:59:06 <shapr> enclosed space?
12:59:39 <shapr> what'st the win condition?
12:59:52 <Riastradh> When the players both pass.
12:59:54 <Riastradh> I think.
12:59:58 <Riastradh> Your client should know.
13:00:23 <shapr> oh
13:00:27 <shapr> you can capture stone
13:00:28 <shapr> s
13:00:56 <Riastradh> Indeed.
13:01:11 <shapr> oops
13:01:17 <shapr> I should really read the rules.
13:01:22 <Riastradh> Nah, just play along.
13:01:28 <Riastradh> You'll get it eventualy.
13:01:29 <shapr> :-P
13:01:31 <Riastradh> lly, even.
13:03:15 <Riastradh> Is Echtelion someone here?
13:03:27 <Riastradh> HEY!
13:03:41 <shapr> ?
13:03:44 <Riastradh> You resigned.
13:03:48 <shapr> yup
13:03:51 * Riastradh mumbles.
13:03:54 <shapr> I'll come back when I read the rules
13:03:59 <Riastradh> OK.
13:04:32 <shapr> you could play against a randomly moving opponent at any time ;-)
13:06:26 <shapr> oh, that's how you capture
13:07:35 <esap> shapr: one thing that might not be obvious from the rules is that you can also avoid capture.
13:08:45 <Riastradh> What are the 'time' and 'byo yomi' fields for?
13:09:11 <Smerdyakov> Bring Your Own Yomi
13:10:40 <esap> riastradh: time is the game time in minutes. Byo yomi is the amount of minutes that you can spend for 15 (hmm.. or 20 I forget) stones after the game time is over before you lose the game.
13:13:37 <shapr> hi jao
13:13:53 <jao> hey shapr
13:13:56 <shapr> what's up?
13:13:57 <Riastradh> Hi.
13:16:17 <jao> hi Riastradh . shapr: slowly learning haskell :)
13:17:33 <Darius> In the Haskell Report: "Many people feel that n+k patterns should not be used. These patterns may be removed or changed in future versions of Haskell."  Isn't this a self-fulfilling prophecy?
13:17:51 <shapr> probably so
13:18:01 <Riastradh> What are n+k patterns?
13:18:32 <Darius> \(n+3) -> n is the same as \n -> n-3
13:18:38 <Riastradh> Oh.
13:18:40 <Riastradh> Ew.
13:18:45 <shapr> yah, that's what I thought
13:18:59 <shapr> though I could understand how they related to x:xs
13:19:12 <Riastradh> But : is a constructor; + is not.
13:19:14 <cale> I think that if we're going to support n+k patterns we should support pattern matching on any function application.
13:19:16 <Darius> I'd imagine it's mainly for the encoding of naturals
13:19:33 <cale> Then again, I don't think n+k is needed.
13:19:50 <Darius> It isn't and it doesn't seem used anymore.
13:20:37 <Darius> I imagine they thought that it was a worthy special case when it was first introduced.
13:21:01 <Darius> The intent being along the lines of naturals with their Peano encoding
13:21:11 <cale> Yeah, if you're going to work with naturals, there's nothing stopping you from introducing data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
13:21:19 <Darius> Efficiency
13:21:40 <Darius> And \(Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ x)))) -> x
13:21:54 <Darius> hardly seems comparable to \(x+4) -> x
13:22:27 <cale> Usually you start out by writing a few helpful functions for working with them.
13:23:00 <cale> Oh, wait I see your point there.
13:23:07 <Darius> Then you lose pattern matching and it's still inefficient.
13:24:43 <cale> Yeah, but the naturals are hardly used outside academic reasons. Is there any huge need for efficiency here?
13:26:00 <Smerdyakov> Oh please.
13:26:09 <Smerdyakov> Many uses of integers just use natural numbers.
13:26:29 <cale> Like you're not going to be implementing some realtime 3D engine and suddenly need n+k matching to speed things up.
13:26:30 <Smerdyakov> And there must be an 'unsigned' type in C for a reason! :P
13:26:57 <cale> That's mostly to get at the extra values.
13:27:05 <kunphuzil> In the code:
13:27:06 <kunphuzil> signum x = 
13:27:06 <kunphuzil>   if x < 0 
13:27:06 <kunphuzil>     then -1 
13:27:06 <kunphuzil>     else if x > 0 
13:27:08 <kunphuzil>       then 0
13:27:11 <kunphuzil>       else 0 
13:27:13 <kunphuzil> what is "signum" for?
13:27:18 <Darius> n+k isn't faster it (I guess) seemed at the time nicer syntactily
13:27:41 <cale> ah, okay.
13:27:45 <Darius> and easy to implement efficiency
13:27:48 <thelsdj> kunphuzil: the name of the function? or do you mean the use of the function?
13:27:50 <Darius> er efficiently 
13:27:59 <cale> shouldn't that be "then 1; else 0"
13:28:13 <thelsdj> hehe that too
13:28:39 <kunphuzil> Oh DUH kunphuzil .. 
13:28:44 <cale> It's the signum function from mathematics - it returns 1 for positive numbers, -1 for negative numbers and 0 for 0.
13:29:01 <Darius> foldNat which is used all over the place (though implicitly) is very nicely written with +1 patterns
13:29:05 <Darius> foldNat s z 0 = z;foldNat s z (n+1) = s n
13:29:27 <Darius> er foldNat s (s n) n
13:29:42 <cale> What about using guards?
13:29:47 <kunphuzil> what is foldNat ?
13:30:38 <Darius> it's a fold over the naturals.  It (I believe) corresponds to primitive recursion and things like take are folds over their argument.
13:31:23 <Darius> foldNat however is only nice with +1 patterns as it fits the patterns of folds, without them it's hardly more complicated.
13:31:33 <cale> Like fact x | x == 0 = 1; | x > 0 = x * fact (x - 1)
13:32:28 <cale> where is foldNat defined?
13:33:05 <kunphuzil> How could I return a string instead of a number?
13:34:14 <cale> kunphuzil - write a string as a return value instead of a number. Just make sure you're not returning both. If you want to do that you'll need a different datatype.
13:34:36 <Darius> cale: It isn't part of the Haskell libraries (at least by that name), however I believe the Bananas,Lenses, and Barbed Wire paper has it I believe.
13:35:03 <Darius> take n (iterate s z) may be equivalent
13:35:07 <kunphuzil> cale:   if x < 0
13:35:07 <kunphuzil>     then "False"         
13:35:16 <kunphuzil> gives errors, i also tried putStrLn
13:35:21 <cale> ah, what's Barbed Wire? I recognize the first two as cata- and ana- morphisms.
13:35:27 <Darius> @eval take 4 $ iterate (\x.x+1) 0
13:35:27 <lambdabot> [0, 1, 2, 3]
13:35:42 <Darius> er nth 4?
13:39:08 <cale> kunphuzil: what sort of errors?
13:42:18 <thelsdj> kunphuzil: make sure your else also returns a string
13:43:20 <Darius> Barbed wire is paramorphisms. What you'd use for e.g. fact.
13:43:46 <Darius> @get-definition para
13:43:46 <lambdabot> para = \c n l.if null l then n else c (head l) (tail l) (para c n (tail l))
13:44:02 <Darius> (well this is a list paramorphism)
13:44:39 <Darius> (compare with...

18:32:57 <Pseudonym> I'ts hard to tell, though.  Reading Campbell is like swimming in molasses.

18:39:06 <Pseudonym> Actually reading Dianetics is even worse than swimming in molasses.
18:39:09 * Pseudonym tried reading it once
18:39:16 <Pseudonym> Just once.
18:39:21 <steveh> o wait, that's another Campbell
18:39:22 <steveh> :)
18:39:35 <Pseudonym> Which Campbell was that?
18:39:41 <steveh> John
18:39:42 <steveh> :)
18:40:10 <Pseudonym> Ah.
18:40:19 <Pseudonym> Sorry, had to look him up.
18:40:44 <stefp> A sure way to regognize a science is that science does not figure in its name. So much for scientology
18:41:14 <stefp> Larry wall did part of a talk about that :)
18:41:48 <steveh> mm computer science
18:41:48 <steveh> :)
18:41:55 <steveh> cognitive science
18:42:02 <stefp> that's part of a general rule that you claim most what you can't easily justify
18:43:40 <stefp> His son pointed out that any subject with the word "science" in the title isn't a science--social science, earth science, Christian science, creation science--dare I mention Scientology? And of course, there's computer science.
18:44:02 <stefp> http://www.jzip.org/jzip/archives/000011.html  too bad the talk itself is not on the net.
18:44:40 <steveh> "social science" and "earth science" are too generic
18:44:56 <steveh> might as well say "life science" isn't a real science
18:45:01 <steveh> or "physical science" :)
18:45:28 <steveh> psychology is fairly scientific, sociology less so
18:45:54 <steveh> and geology is most definitely a science
18:45:59 <steveh> as is ecology for that matter
18:46:53 <stefp> what about astrology? :) :)
18:47:29 * steveh had a prof that lectured on theoretical debates inside astrology
18:47:34 <Pseudonym> Anything edning in "-ology" is too generic.
18:47:35 <stefp> well, historically it has been a good source of revenues for astronomers
18:47:43 <steveh> something to do with calendars and whatnot
18:48:04 <steveh> he only lectured on it once of course
18:48:48 <steveh> there is a schism within astrology as to which dating system to use when determining someone's sign
18:48:50 <steveh> or somesuch
18:49:30 <steveh> that was for a philosophy of science course, two "softenings" for the price of one!
18:50:41 <Pseudonym> It's kind of interesting, actually.  Campbell quotes Freud talking about religion, about how religion has, in the past, played a vital psychological role, but today, people only see the symbols rather than the truth.
18:50:48 <Pseudonym> And... psychoanalysis is the truth!
18:50:52 <Pseudonym> Oh, the irony.
18:50:57 <steveh> heheh
18:51:12 <steveh> they ripped off Feuerbach there
18:51:32 <steveh> except for the psychoanalysis part
18:51:40 <steveh> though Feuerbach was pro- introspection of course
18:52:51 <stefp> Freud freaked out at the paranormal stuff that Jung was so found of.
18:53:43 <steveh> should clarify, that's ludwig feuerbach, not karl
18:53:45 <steveh> :)
18:54:15 <stefp> Jung was some  kind of shaman and this was not in line with Freud who was quite "positivist".
18:55:03 * Pseudonym knows little about psychoanalysis
18:55:07 <Pseudonym> Actually, I have a question.
18:56:07 <Pseudonym> Do you know of a more recent book which looks back on all this and goes through what was right and what was wrong?
18:56:22 <Pseudonym> I know, for example, that Freud et al didn't appreciate the role of biochemistry in mental illness.
18:56:27 <steveh> from a therapeutic point of view?
18:56:36 <steveh> a philosophical point of view?
18:56:44 <steveh> a historical point of view?
18:56:50 <Pseudonym> Well I'm more interested in mythology and storytelling, but anything will do.
18:57:04 <steveh> then no I don't
18:57:10 <stefp> Freud played with cocaine and lost at least one patient. So this may explain some of it.
18:57:26 <stefp> Anyway dust has not settled yet.
18:57:31 <Pseudonym> True.
18:57:36 <steveh> it's very difficult to classify things as "right" and "wrong" when you're talking about interpretations like this
18:57:36 <steveh> :)
18:57:40 <Pseudonym> :-)
18:58:03 <Pseudonym> a lot of the bows that Campbell draws seem to be quite long to this relatively ignorant reader.
18:58:08 <steveh> skinner does a good job of keeping it real
18:58:10 <steveh> perhaps too real
18:58:18 <steveh> but that's the therapeutic side
18:58:19 <stefp> I think that the stuff about woman longing to have a penis is accepted as bogus.
18:58:25 * Pseudonym nods
18:58:25 <steveh> not much to do with mythology and symbolism
18:58:53 <Pseudonym> Well, for example, I think that the whole "all neurotics are either Oedipus or Hamlet" is at best only partly true.
18:59:16 <stefp> Freud was living in a patriarchal society and did not got rid of all the associated prejudices.
18:59:20 * Pseudonym nods
18:59:25 <Pseudonym> See, this is what I want to know. :-)
18:59:44 <Pseudonym> Even from a theraputic point of view, that may help.  Dream symbolism is related to mythology.
18:59:46 <stefp> homosexuality was considered an illness for example.
19:00:19 <steveh> it wasn't removed from the DSM-IV until the 70s
19:00:55 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:01:06 <Pseudonym> I think the 70s was DSM III, actually.
19:01:13 <Pseudonym> Or IIIR possibly.
19:01:51 <stefp> but for the christina republican, it is not a illness but a plague :)
19:02:24 <Pseudonym> Is it contagious, then?
19:02:45 <stefp> they deliberately spread aids...
19:03:24 <stefp> and black extremist would say that it is a plot to wipe out their race. I love america :)
19:03:53 <stefp> our Le Pen is downright boring compared to that.
19:04:17 <Pseudonym> BBIAB.  Meeting
19:04:21 <steveh> stefp: except one side controls the government while the other is completely marginalized :)
19:05:09 <stefp> this christian coaliation behind the republican is scary
19:05:30 <shrimpx> gays control the govt?
19:05:41 <shrimpx> wait i misread :)
19:14:20 <stefp> http://www.echonyc.com/~meehan/Soil/Territor/springer.html  I lost the link to the video
19:15:22 <stefp> satellite feed in 1992 told the backstage of politics
19:15:49 <shrimpx> i watched some of those
19:15:55 <shrimpx> at school
19:30:20 <shrimpx> hah, that robertson stuff is nuts
23:16:58 <kyagrd> hello
23:18:01 <Pseudonym> G'day.
23:18:44 <Lilith> hi
23:19:00 <Lilith> Pseudonym: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~shuyingw/thesis
23:19:06 <Pseudonym> Ooh, cool.
23:19:19 * Pseudonym was going to ask about that while attempting not to appear rude
23:19:31 <Pseudonym> Thanks.
23:19:37 <Pseudonym> Oh.
23:19:48 <Pseudonym> Could you please check the file permissions?
23:19:52 <Lilith> i haven't gotten round to prettying up stuff
23:19:54 <Lilith> oh
23:20:19 <Lilith> sorry :)
23:20:23 <Pseudonym> 'Sokay.
23:20:30 <Pseudonym> Works fine now, thanks.
23:24:09 <Pseudonym> Looks interesting.
23:24:44 <Lilith> :)
23:46:23 <kyagrd> How do I solve the chain memory leaking problem
23:46:29 <kyagrd> :-(
23:46:40 <kyagrd> Sound strange but ...
23:47:08 <kyagrd> It  can often happen
23:49:12 <kyagrd> for example you want to compute someting with a recursive function
23:49:46 <seth> why doesn't the garbage collector take care of the memory?
23:49:57 <kyagrd> >
23:50:00 <kyagrd> > compute x = if end_conditon x then return x else compute x
23:50:01 <kyagrd> >
23:50:23 <kyagrd> > main = print (comput init_value)
23:50:27 <kyagrd> like this
23:50:52 <kyagrd> x1 = compute x0, x2 = compute x1, ... and so one it evaluates
23:50:55 <seth> that is actually converted into a loop by the compiler, and isn't recursive at all when executing
23:51:02 <kyagrd> problem is
23:51:14 <kyagrd> it does not evaluate until it meets print at the end !!
23:51:36 <kyagrd> so thunk piles up and heap overflows ...
23:51:36 <seth> you can usually rearrange the function to not have that behavior
23:51:53 <kyagrd> It's not so easy
23:51:59 <seth> sometimes yes, sometimes no
23:52:23 <kyagrd> If you are for example implementing language interperter or debugger somewhat complicated things
23:52:38 <kyagrd> It's hard to tweak ...
23:52:44 <kyagrd> Any general solution for this ?
23:52:56 <kyagrd> whell If I print every step It does not leak :-(
23:53:03 <seth> if you are implementing a recursive decent parser you have the problem regardless of the implementation language
23:53:32 <seth> the general solution is to make the compiler smart enough to convert it into non-recursive code.  Of course that is impossible, but the compiler does it in a lot of cases.
23:54:12 <esap> It's impossible in the general case.
23:54:33 <seth> right, but it is possible in a lot of common cases.
23:55:12 <kyagrd> I made a lazy languge evaluator of sestoft97.
23:55:41 <kyagrd> abstract machine itself does not memory leak but haskell heap overflows :-(
23:56:41 <kyagrd> Are there recursive strict operator versoin of ($!)
23:57:25 <esap> kyagrd: deepSeq
23:57:37 <seth> you can force anything to be strict
23:57:56 <kyagrd> wow !!
23:58:43 <kyagrd> Is it in the haskell 98 report, I couldn't find it ..
23:58:57 <esap> kyagrd: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2001-August/007712.html
23:59:00 <seth> Did you check the library part of the report?
23:59:12 <seth> Of course people have written libraries that are not in the report
23:59:57 <kyagrd> Is it in the prelude ?
