01:13:22 <phubuh> hey dudes.
01:13:53 <Arnia> Hey
01:16:30 <phubuh> compiling X, Qt, and KDE takes a really long time :-(
02:26:50 <debug> hm
03:05:23 <wottt> hi i was wondering if any one could help me with a quicksort program, without using list comprehension
03:05:40 <andersca> wottt: just use filter :)
03:05:53 <wottt> ohh yea not allowed to use that too
03:06:12 <wottt> all the examples ive seen so far either use list comprehension or filter
03:06:33 <wottt> im having trouble with the recursion
03:09:23 <wottt> i've just started using haskell so atm the functions which im allowed to use a very limited
03:33:18 <wottt> ??
03:33:37 <shapr> whee
03:33:39 <shapr> er
03:33:42 <shapr> interjection
03:33:55 <wottt> can ne1 help?
03:33:59 <Marvin--> whee: your nick is too confusing, go away :)
03:34:18 <Marvin--> wottt: you'll have to write a recursive function that special-cases filter for your problem
03:34:51 <wottt> the prob is that i cant have filter in it
03:35:18 <Marvin--> which is why you have to write your own recursive function
03:35:24 <Marvin--> you need filter-like *behaviour*
03:35:30 <wottt> ok
03:35:33 <wottt> sorry
03:35:38 <Marvin--> I think the goal of the exercise is to get familiar with recursion
03:35:47 * shapr bounces happily
03:35:50 <wottt> yea 
03:36:22 <wottt> im having trouble with the terminating condition though
03:36:38 <shapr> ok, now I'm going to figure out how return multiple rows, and how to delete entries
03:39:07 <wottt> well thanks neways
03:39:28 <Marvin--> Let the phooeeeeenix ariiiise, from the aaaashes of liiiiife
03:39:38 <shapr> Marvin--: it's morning already?
03:39:40 <andersca> indeed.
03:39:51 <andersca> the weather is really nice
03:39:51 * Marvin-- is listening to Stratovarius
03:39:54 <shapr> oh
03:40:05 <shapr> hm, which music today...
03:40:25 <shapr> Tenacious D? Steve Reich? Norah Jones?
03:40:32 <Marvin--> Finnish power metal! :D
03:40:39 <shapr> I don't have any 
03:40:41 <Arnia> BBC 6Music
03:41:18 <shapr> I'm sort of in the mood for some heavy metal
03:43:43 <shapr> Arnia: what's 6Music?
03:44:34 <Arnia> Specialist interest music radio station run by the BBC... www.bbc.co.uk/radio
03:45:02 <Arnia> Listening to all sorts of BBC radio online atm :)
03:46:15 <opet> it's nice to know our license fees are going somewhere
03:46:28 <opet> I wonder how much they spend on the whole web/interactive stuff?
03:48:36 <Arnia> Quite a bit... but they've made some amazing advances in the whole IA thing. The BBCi service is one of my homes online. They have my favourite community (h2g2), my favourite radio stations, one of my two prefered news sources, a great gardening database etc
03:48:59 <opet> they just bought h2g2 though, didn't they?
03:49:22 <Arnia> Two years ago almost exactly...
03:49:43 * shapr is listening to Papa Roach
03:49:56 <opet> I've not looked at much of their online stuff outside of news 
03:50:16 <opet> that in itself is very impressive
03:50:22 <shapr> anyone here used the PostgreSQL binding in HToolkit?
03:50:33 <Arnia> The DNA software that Jim and Mark developed for h2g2 is now being used to run a huge range of community sites across the BBC
03:50:57 <Arnia> The BBC News service has monitoring powers that rival many intelligence organisations
03:51:38 <opet> I used to drive by some of their listening stations in caversham a lot
03:51:41 <opet> biiiiiig dishes
03:52:15 <Arnia> Yes... and they have reporters all around the world.
03:53:05 <opet> do you reckon it's worth the fees?
03:53:09 <opet> I think it is
03:53:15 <Arnia> Yes, definitely
03:53:46 <Arnia> Can you imagine if it was forced to compete for the 'mass interest' like ITV and SkyOne do?
03:54:36 <opet> some people keep whining that they should
03:55:24 <opet> "itv is better because corrie has higher audience figures than eastenders! scrap the bbc!"
03:56:26 <Arnia> Ask them whether they want a balanced news service, a production of original programmes and a dedication to advancing the distribution of information to all
04:01:47 <Marvin--> I love the two "government" owned TV channels in Sweden
04:01:52 <Marvin--> waaaay too much crap on the commercial channels
04:02:14 <phubuh> you got it wrong, it's the other way around
04:02:27 <opet> oh yeah, that's another good point
04:02:30 <opet> no commercials
04:02:46 <Arnia> The BBC isn't government owned... its run under Royal Charter which means it is legally obliged to fulfil its charter but the government doesn't have control
04:03:14 <Marvin--> Arnia: well, that's what I meant
04:03:30 <Marvin--> sort of the same thing as here, though we don't call things "Royal Charter" ;)
04:04:56 <shapr> the swedish king looks like a nice guy
04:05:34 <Marvin--> the swedish king... *shudder*
04:05:36 <Marvin--> damn, laundry time
04:05:49 <shapr> I think it's cool to live in a country with a king
04:06:01 <phubuh> i think it's cool to live in a country with princess madeleine
04:06:03 <shapr> the money here is even called crowns
04:06:17 <shapr> who's princess madeleine?
04:06:18 <opet> I'm glad we don't have a king
04:06:26 <opet> because if we did, it'd be prince philip
04:06:29 <opet> and he's a moron
04:06:51 <shapr> http://www.princess-madeleine.com/
04:06:59 <shapr> phubuh: ok, suddenly, I agree with you.
04:07:01 <Arnia> I'm reading a book on UK constitutional law atm. Very interesting... complicated, but far more powerful than a written constitution.
04:07:03 <phubuh> :-)
04:08:38 <shapr> she's cute :-)
04:08:47 <phubuh> indeed
04:09:58 <phubuh> oh darn, ghc doesn't compile in gentoo.
04:11:00 <phubuh> oh well, i'll just use hugs until ghc gets fixed
04:11:58 <Marvin--> I think monarchy is a thing of ancient past that should be abolished
04:12:18 <shapr> I doubt it would bring down the taxes any...
04:12:27 <shapr> oh hey!
04:12:39 <shapr> I have a green card interview at the migrationsverket!
04:12:45 <shapr> is that cool or what?
04:12:46 <phubuh> hey, cool!
04:12:47 <Marvin--> cool!
04:13:03 <Marvin--> I don't think it would bring down taxes either, to me it's a matter of principle
04:13:16 <shapr> assuming the interview goes well (which I don't doubt) I'll have a real residence and work permit for Sweden.
04:13:21 <phubuh> that's great
04:13:24 <Arnia> I disagree... the monarchy in the UK is a great balance to the government and the office of the Crown is meant to be a long term advisor to many (comparatively) transitive parliaments
04:13:37 <Marvin--> I like the way Swedish elections work and wouldn't want to change that if we had a president
04:13:38 <shapr> I think it depends on the culture
04:13:45 <Marvin--> the swedish king is only a figure head
04:13:47 <Marvin--> and a bad figure head at that
04:13:49 <shapr> some countries work better with greater continuity
04:13:53 <Marvin--> the man isn't even allowed to vote
04:14:33 <Arnia> The Queen isn't allowed to vote... she's meant to be above party politics and an advisor for all the people's interests (rather than one party's)
04:14:44 <shapr> oh, maybe I just need to call fetch repeatedly...
04:14:47 * andersca agrees with Marvin--
04:15:05 <opet> I don't see how it makes the slightest bit of difference#
04:15:29 <shapr> shapr :: #Brain#
04:15:36 <shapr> see, now you can tell I'm think out of the box =)
04:15:43 <shapr> er "thinking"
04:16:11 <Marvin--> I find the idea to pass on a public position by birth right revolting
04:16:22 <Marvin--> shapr: eeeew that was a lame joke
04:16:29 * shapr cackles happily
04:16:31 <shapr> yes, it was
04:16:49 <Arnia> opet: I didn't realise how much of a difference it would make until I began reading this book
04:16:53 <shapr> Marvin--: on the other hand, lifelong training might be an advantage in cases of public utility
04:17:33 <phubuh> a lifelong course in eating with an unthinkable amount of eating tools and waving to strangers in zimbabwe
04:17:41 <opet> Arnia: to be perfectly selfish, if the queen was replaced by some figurehead president (like ireland) then why would it make any difference to me?
04:17:49 <Arnia> Marvin--: This office needs a lot of training... its main purpose is a long-term advisor on British politics and protector against parliamentry soveriegnty
04:18:15 <Marvin--> Arnia: I'm pretty damn sure the Swedish king has nothing to do with long-term advising in politics
04:18:26 <Marvin--> and I'd be horrified if that was the case
04:18:34 <Arnia> opet: Blair could pass a bill making his parliament last forever
04:18:55 <Marvin--> Arnia: that's impossible in Sweden because of the constitutional law
04:19:40 <Marvin--> well, it'd be possible in the sense that you could pass it twice, with a reelection inbetween, but I'm skeptical that anyone would vote for a party that want to change the constitutional law drastically
04:19:41 <opet> Arnia: that's a constitutional technicality, not a real world thing. why does it affect me?
04:20:11 <Arnia> Marvin--: The UK's constitution is unwritten. It is very flexible, and has adjusted admirably to changing as society changes.
04:20:18 <shapr> oh no... politics
04:20:28 <Arnia> opet: Because knowing Blair, he WOULD pass such a bill if he could
04:20:44 <Arnia> There are other reasons too, but I'm still assimilating them :)
04:20:53 <shapr> any other suggestions for irc 'bot features?
04:20:58 <opet> heh
04:21:04 <phubuh> shapr: artificial intelligence! :-P
04:21:08 <opet> Arnia: so cynical.. :p
04:21:23 <shapr> phubuh: good idea... quick, write a lambdabot plugin  ;-)
04:21:28 <Marvin--> Arnia: changing Swedish constitution requires the change passing two votes in the parliament, with a re-election in-between
04:21:30 <phubuh> i'll be done by next week
04:21:34 <shapr> phubuh: excellent
04:21:35 <Marvin--> i.e. the people decide consitution changes
04:21:50 <Marvin--> the way it should be, IMO
04:21:54 <shapr> looks like I just call fetch until it returns false
04:22:01 <shapr> and then I have all the rows...
04:22:03 * shapr tries that
04:22:56 <shapr> how can I do a case IO True ?
04:23:02 <Marvin--> shapr: hey, you can't sit here coding while we're in the middle of a political flamewa^Wdebate
04:23:08 <shapr> why not?
04:23:18 <Marvin--> you have to participate in the flamewa^Wdebate
04:23:22 <shapr> at least I'm being productive ;-)
04:23:24 <shapr> oh... ok
04:23:31 <shapr> politics sucks!
04:23:42 <Marvin--> a bit tangential, but okay
04:23:47 <shapr> too bad Smerdyakov isn't here
04:24:09 <shapr> he has an interesting political viewpoint.
04:24:35 <phubuh> compiling kde, qt, and xfree86 has taken about 12 hours so far
04:24:37 <phubuh> :-/
04:24:54 <shapr> should I loan my Athlon MP 1800+ ?
04:25:12 <shapr> why do I keep dropping words in irc when I'm mentally caught up in coding?
04:25:33 <shapr> we need a distcc collective
04:25:37 <shapr> and distghc
04:26:22 <Marvin--> what was the flag to turn of Prelude loading in ghc?
04:26:30 <shapr> -fno-prelude I think
04:26:39 <Marvin--> that's what I thought too
04:26:45 <shapr> hey, there's a good irc 'bot feature
04:26:57 <Marvin--> oh yes
04:27:15 <Marvin--> make it print all ghc flags, in the channel ;)
04:27:21 * shapr laughs
04:27:23 <shapr> that would be evil
04:27:43 <shapr> as I've said before, ghc has more flags than the UN
04:28:32 <Marvin--> yes
04:29:08 <shapr> hm, how do I wrap "success <- fetch statement" in an until...
04:29:12 <debug> :)
04:29:35 * shapr hacks around
04:30:05 <Marvin--> ah, -fno-implicit-prelude
04:30:11 <shapr> aha
04:30:28 <shapr> they should give -fno-prelude as a mnemonic
04:30:52 <Marvin--> Foo.hs:4: Illegal binding of built-in syntax: []
04:30:53 <Marvin--> bah
04:32:35 * andersca tries the new spamassassin
04:33:21 <shapr> I wonder how hard it would be to get HaskellDB running on Database.PostgreSQL.HSQL
04:33:38 <shapr> I know Daan Leijen was hoping to do that
04:36:34 <Marvin--> WOOH
04:36:38 <shapr> ?
04:37:02 <Marvin--> I could run a Haskell file through both frontend and backend and E proves that there's a bug
04:37:08 <shapr> yay!
04:37:16 <Marvin--> so parsing "works", and the TPTP backend "works"
04:37:24 <shapr> w00!
04:37:29 <shapr> you get the gold star!
04:39:54 <debug> Marvin--: you never told me about your masters project
04:40:06 <Marvin--> I didn't? D'oh :)
04:40:31 <Marvin--> I'm experimenting with encoding Haskell programs in first order logic, and using automatic theorem provers to find bugs
04:40:58 <ludde> first order logic?
04:41:00 <debug> ok
04:41:24 <shapr> OuterMind: d00d, you bounce a lot
04:41:28 <Marvin--> ludde: predikatlogik
04:41:42 <OuterMind> shapr: I've problems with my router
04:41:43 <shapr> jag kan inte predikatlogik.
04:41:51 <shapr> OuterMind: anything you need help with?
04:41:57 <ludde> can all haskell programs be written using that?
04:42:06 <OuterMind> but this time was because I changed from 32bit to 16 bit
04:42:15 <OuterMind> shapr: no no, I already know why
04:42:19 <shapr> ok
04:42:25 <OuterMind> shapr: it's a DoS
04:42:26 <Marvin--> shapr: In-file: http://193.11.232.159:8080/List.hs  out-file: http://193.11.232.159:8080/list.tptp
04:42:30 <OuterMind> 3com 812
04:42:41 <OuterMind> but I cannot update my firmware
04:42:42 <shapr> OuterMind: are you an ircwarrior?
04:42:50 <Marvin--> ludde: no, you can't encode higher-order functions and partial applications straight-forwardly
04:42:54 <OuterMind> shapr: LOL, NOOOOo!!!
04:43:01 <shapr> ok, just checking :-)
04:43:08 * Marvin-- laughs at shapr
04:43:14 <OuterMind> shapr: when the routing tables get fill, the router fall down
04:43:25 <shapr> why can't you update the firmware?
04:43:31 <OuterMind> shapr: mldonkey makes too much connections
04:43:34 <shapr> oh
04:43:39 <OuterMind> shapr: I did a trick
04:44:00 <OuterMind> shapr: I've a 3com dual-link, it's a modem not a router
04:44:21 <shapr> Marvin--: that's very cool
04:44:22 <OuterMind> shapr: but it admits the 3com firmware, but only one version
04:44:25 <Marvin--> ludde: I haven't gotten to that yet... a lot can be done with inlining of course (manual inlining in the list example)
04:44:30 <shapr> OuterMind: that sucks
04:44:36 <debug> Marvin--: who came up with the idea for your project?
04:44:39 <Marvin--> shapr: mind-bogglingly cool :-)
04:44:41 <Marvin--> debug: Koen
04:44:55 <shapr> Marvin--: as far as I know, you're on the bleeding edge of research
04:45:06 <Marvin--> shapr: that's what Koen says too
04:45:07 <OuterMind> shapr: yep, but at least I've a router
04:45:09 <OuterMind> ;P
04:45:37 <shapr> Marvin--: I searched everything I could to find more about your project and I found one result
04:45:40 <ludde> you encode programs into predicate logic.. but how do you verify if they are correct?
04:45:57 <shapr> OuterMind: yes, better than nothing
04:46:03 <OuterMind> :)
04:46:18 <Marvin--> shapr: oh? URL?
04:46:24 <ludde> bbiab.
04:46:31 <shapr> I don't remember, it wasn't very exciting.
04:46:48 <shapr> some long tortuous manual process used to prove the correctness of a program
04:46:58 <shapr> my eyes crossed after a few pages
04:47:03 <Marvin--> heh
04:47:10 <Marvin--> well there
04:47:15 <Marvin--> there's much research in that area
04:47:40 <shapr> maybe I was searching for the wrong things
04:47:54 <Marvin--> I'm still not quite sure what I'm doing myself, so :)
04:47:57 <phubuh> wouldn't it be vulnerable to gödel attacks? :-)
04:48:01 <shapr> if you end up adding a GHC extension to prove program correctness, that would rock
04:48:05 <shapr> phubuh: I've wondered that myself
04:48:08 <Marvin--> phubuh: yes
04:48:22 <Marvin--> shapr: that's a few years off ;)
04:48:26 * opet blinks at odd ghc errors
04:48:44 <shapr> couldn't you used Meijer's Bananas, lenses, etc to pull some of the gödel vulnerabilities out into things to be checked?
04:49:02 <shapr> Meijer pulls recursion out into a 'constant' property in that paper
04:49:05 <phubuh> meijer's bananas? what an interesting name
04:49:29 <shapr> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~erik/Personal/classic.htm
04:49:46 <shapr> "Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire"
04:49:56 <Marvin--> "My attempt to beat Phil Wadler in inventing sexy titles." hahah
04:50:03 <phubuh> haha
04:50:29 <shapr> "shirts off to wadler" -- Simon Peyton-Jones
04:50:41 <Marvin--> argh, 404
04:50:43 <Marvin--> yeah
04:50:43 <phubuh> ugh, 404
04:50:44 <phubuh> heh
04:50:50 <shapr> :-(
04:50:52 <Marvin--> phubuh: get out of my head! ;)
04:50:57 <phubuh> no, you get out of mine!
04:52:01 <shapr> in any case, I think Meijer's idea of pulling recursion out into a 'constant' can be applied to the gödel problem
04:52:03 * Marvin-- grins at AndersE' additions to the quotes book
04:52:19 <shapr> or at least to parts of it
04:52:27 <phubuh> ah
04:52:46 <shapr> too bad Arnia isn't here, he probably has some thoughts on that
04:52:48 <phubuh> google for "meijer bananas" and follow the link to his homepage at research.microsoft.com
04:53:01 <phubuh> there's a pdf there, under Software Design
04:53:15 <Marvin--> I'm lazy, paste a URL
04:53:23 <opet> lol
04:53:38 * shapr fights the monads
04:54:05 <phubuh> i'm too lazy to find out how to find the url of a link in lynx, and i don't have mouse support in console :-P
04:54:15 <Marvin--> eew, lynx
04:54:17 <shapr> see, we need a 'bot that does google searches
04:54:43 <phubuh> yeah, i just installed gentoo, and x+kde is taking a while to compile
04:55:05 <Marvin--> eew, gentoo
04:55:11 * shapr uses debian
04:55:14 <Marvin--> dang, why didn't I take the aafp course
04:55:24 <phubuh> i got annoyed with debian
04:55:31 <shapr> Marvin--: it conflicted with something else you had to do at the same time
04:55:38 <phubuh> unstable, which is the only branch with half-new software, tends to break
04:55:39 <shapr> you wanted to, remember?
04:55:46 <shapr> phubuh: works fine for me
04:55:54 <shapr> I've only had one breakage in several years
04:55:58 <phubuh> you haven't tried to install kde recently :/
04:56:01 <shapr> that's true
04:56:06 <shapr> I don't use kde
04:56:08 <shapr> or gnome lately
04:56:17 <Marvin--> phubuh: works fine for me too, and yes there's been problems with kde lately, but it's getting better afaik
04:56:27 <shapr> just ion, emacs, galeon, and gnome-terminal
04:56:42 <Marvin--> oh wait, this was probably a year old aafp course
04:56:52 <phubuh> emacs was broken some weeks like two months ago
04:56:57 <shapr> really?
04:57:04 <phubuh> actually emacs wasn't really at fault, some encryption library thingy was
04:57:12 <shapr> hm, I never had any problems.
04:57:22 <phubuh> i have the worst luck
04:57:41 <phubuh> oh well, reformatting is a good thing for me
04:57:43 <shapr> well, I have a tendency to fix any problems I find and send either bug reports or patches
04:57:46 <phubuh> i tend to get inspired to try new things
04:58:18 <shapr> that's a good thing too
04:58:37 <shapr> otoh, I find it easiest to try new things in debian, where I can just apt-get install and apt-get remove
04:59:01 <phubuh> emerge does pretty much the same thing, it just takes a little longer :-)
04:59:15 <shapr> I'm about as impatient as it gets
04:59:21 <Marvin--> oh, right, I should change my comments about "destructors", calling them catamorphisms instead
04:59:23 <Marvin--> that's more 1337
04:59:28 <shapr> yah, totally
04:59:38 <shapr> then you can start talking about hylomorphisms
04:59:41 <phubuh> haha
04:59:43 <shapr> (whatever those are)
05:00:46 <shapr> anamorphisms sounds like a curse that changes gender
05:00:50 <shapr> Hi, I'm Anna.
05:01:27 <phubuh> haha
05:01:33 <phubuh> YAY!!!
05:01:35 <Marvin--> anamorphisms are "constructors", catamorphisms are "destructors" and hylomorphisms are "translations" composed by anamorphisms and catamorphisms
05:01:36 <Marvin--> or something
05:01:37 <phubuh> kde is all compiled!
05:01:43 <shapr> Marvin--: yah! that's it!
05:02:27 <shapr> ana -> animate, cata -> catastrophe, hylo -> ?
05:02:34 <shapr> translate
05:02:57 * shapr shrugs
05:03:12 * Marvin-- goes to change all the destr_List_Cons predicates to cata_List_Cons :P
05:03:26 <shapr> whee
05:03:41 <debug> carnivo_xxx
05:03:55 * debug suddenly feels like eating some Meat
05:03:56 <Marvin--> ana == upwards, cata == downwards
05:03:57 <shapr> Anna_List_Cons
05:04:06 <Marvin--> hylo is matter or something
05:04:08 <shapr> oh
05:04:12 <shapr> oh yeah, I knew that
05:04:14 <shapr> that's greek
05:04:28 * shapr dusts off his brain
05:04:38 <Marvin--> it could also mean dust :P
05:04:40 <shapr> heh
05:05:19 <opet> latin I could handle, but greek was a step too far
05:05:21 * Marvin-- thinks he's earned a break after this kind of progress
05:05:25 * opet shudders
05:05:42 * shapr gives in to recursion
05:05:54 <Marvin--> mwhahaha, yes, yes, sell your soul to recursion like the rest of us
05:06:02 * shapr grins
05:06:04 * Marvin-- coughs
05:06:05 <Marvin--> did I say that?
05:06:19 <shapr> um, what's the url for your quote server again?
05:06:31 <Marvin--> http://193.11.232.159:8080/quotes/
05:13:26 <Marvin--> whoops, I've forgotten about my laundry again
05:15:09 <creature> Heh, I suffer from that problem. 
05:15:20 * creature looks at mounting pile in the corner.
05:18:41 <Marvin--> damn slow washing machines
05:18:46 <Marvin--> damn them to hell
05:31:08 <Marvin--> cute, my queue example worked too
05:59:51 <debug> "Är det någon här inne som inte förstår svenska?"
05:59:53 <debug> hahaha
05:59:55 <debug> Marvin-- :)
06:00:16 <shapr> jag kan inte förstår svenska.
06:01:23 <debug> :)
06:01:37 <debug> jag kan inte svenska.   or  jag förstår inte svenska.
06:01:45 <shapr> see? I told you ;-)
06:01:58 <debug> shapr: but your swedish is pretty good
06:02:22 <debug> it is better than my haskell
06:02:28 <shapr> hehe
06:02:31 <shapr> thanks :-)
06:02:34 <debug> which doesn't really tell much
06:02:38 <shapr> I've only been studying for three months
06:03:02 <shapr> I've told Marvin-- I'll chat with him in swedish at the ICFP/HW in Uppsala
06:03:23 <debug> practice makes perfect
06:03:35 <shapr> yes, in both swedish and haskell
06:03:36 <debug> what's this company you're talking about?
06:03:49 <shapr> my new company?  http://www.webwitches.com/
06:04:11 <shapr> http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/webwitcheslogo.jpg
06:04:37 <debug> the text is black on black in my browser :(
06:05:09 <shapr> it's a three person partnership, I'm the infrastructure, they're the content :-)
06:05:48 <shapr> translation, EU project management, websites, online learning (both infrastructure and content) etc etc
06:05:50 <debug> hehe ok
06:06:02 * debug has a broken life
06:06:09 <shapr> why is your life broken?
06:06:55 <debug> I've finally started taking courses that I wanted to take 3 years ago
06:06:55 <shapr> that's good
06:06:55 <debug> I dropped out of chalmers, and have had a long way "back" into the studies I wanted to actually do
06:07:13 <shapr> I dropped out of uab.edu, and haven't gotten back yet.. but I hope to get back at Luleå
06:07:41 <debug> ok
06:07:43 <shapr> I wonder if I can test out of some of the programming classes.
06:07:51 * debug is planning to take at least 1 year off
06:08:01 <debug> programming is good for your soul
06:08:14 <shapr> last time I had a programming class we were using IBM XTs with 640k ram and dual 5.25 floppies
06:08:22 <debug> hehe
06:08:46 <debug> yeah, I wrote my first multitaskers on 286:es and XT:s
06:08:49 <shapr> we wrote code using the ROM BASIC
06:09:01 <debug> it was a good time in life
06:09:01 <shapr> debug: how old are you?
06:09:05 <debug> 24
06:09:08 <shapr> I'm 31
06:09:24 <debug> then you have your whole life ahead of you
06:09:25 <shapr> the old times sucked, now I actually own computers :-)
06:09:28 <debug> :)
06:09:31 <debug> hehe
06:09:45 <debug> I spent most of the time when I was young dreaming about Unix
06:09:49 <shapr> me too
06:09:57 <shapr> I dreamed a little too much maybe
06:10:00 <debug> I'd read about Coherent unix, but it was not free
06:10:25 <shapr> I found that I could dial into the local university modem block and telnet out from there
06:10:30 <debug> :)
06:11:01 <shapr> I learned a lot about Unix, but none of it was constructive, I didn't write useful code.
06:11:06 * debug still has an old Silent 700 terminal that writes on heat-sensitive paper... 110 baud, 300 in high-speed (simplex) mode
06:11:20 <debug> (it isn't very silent, though)
06:11:24 <shapr> I wonder if I still have my 1200 baud modem around here
06:11:27 <debug> the old days were better
06:11:31 <shapr> no way
06:11:41 <shapr> I wanted to learn how to program so bad I could taste it
06:11:48 <debug> for me they were, because then my parents payed for stuff
06:11:48 <shapr> but I couldn't get a compiler or a real OS
06:11:57 <shapr> I started programming with debug.com
06:12:00 <shapr> on DOS 3.31
06:12:02 * debug too :)
06:12:04 <debug> hence my nick
06:12:18 <debug> I remember the switch from DOS 2 to 3.3 faintly
06:12:30 <shapr> I had 3.0 or so, but it sucked
06:12:36 <shapr> 3.31 was much better
06:12:42 <debug> and I read alot about the different internal changes between 1 and 2.0
06:12:49 <debug> (like VMS -> Unix style change)
06:13:05 <debug> files became byte addressable, instead of block based
06:13:11 <shapr> these days, I have Linux, I have lots of compilers, I have HUGE amounts of source code freely available!
06:13:14 <shapr> it's awesome!
06:13:30 <debug> still, much of the magic has been taken away :-/
06:13:32 <debug> which is sad
06:13:36 <shapr> nooo, there is more magic!
06:13:43 <debug> hm
06:13:44 <shapr> Haskell is gorgeous magic
06:13:47 <debug> :)
06:13:47 <debug> hehe
06:13:54 <shapr> Itanium's EPIC is magic
06:14:11 <shapr> I have a dual CPU machine
06:14:17 <shapr> that's extra sexy magic
06:14:29 <shapr> I've never been able to do *real* multiprocessing before
06:14:34 <shapr> I've been dreaming about that for decades
06:14:39 <debug> yes
06:14:54 <debug> I'm still dreaming (and planning) a cluster microkernel
06:14:58 <debug> +about
06:14:58 <shapr> all of my crazy ideas are actually in reach now
06:15:07 <debug> :)
06:15:10 <debug> that's a good feeling
06:15:13 <shapr> fractal compression using multidimensional suffix trees
06:15:21 <shapr> reconfigurable hardware
06:15:28 <shapr> true distributed computing
06:15:34 <jlouis> Itanium sucks big time
06:15:44 <jlouis> give me an Alpha instead, thanks
06:15:47 <debug> jlouis: it remains to be seen
06:15:47 <shapr> jlouis: even so, EPIC is nifty magic
06:15:54 * debug runs Alpha
06:16:03 <jlouis> tests until now show Alpha far better
06:16:07 <shapr> EPIC = explicitly parallel instruction computing
06:16:09 <debug> maybe in 10 years I'll afford a used ev7  ;)
06:16:18 <shapr> EPIC seems to have been designed for a Haskell compiler =)
06:16:38 <debug> shapr: well, compiling for EPIC is, to say the least, non-trivial
06:16:53 <shapr> I bet it's a lot easier to compile from GHC to EPIC
06:17:06 <shapr> the sequencing is explicit in Haskell
06:17:14 <shapr> or implicit as need be
06:17:38 <debug> ev8 would have been fantastic though
06:18:15 <debug> http://www.realworldtech.com/page.cfm?section=columns&AID=RWT121300000000
06:18:32 <debug> (the figures for ev8 are not real, as ev8 will never actually be produced)
06:18:45 <debug> but the technology lives on in other processors
06:19:29 <shapr> yes, I wish Alpha were still being produced
06:19:34 <debug> 8 instructions per cycle
06:19:37 <debug> at 2GHz
06:19:38 <shapr> it was the best CPU yet
06:19:44 <debug> 64GB/s databus
06:19:45 <debug> yes
06:19:57 <debug> some germans built a 256- och 512-cpu machine using ev7 I think
06:20:04 <debug> they used "mother torii" instead of motherboards
06:20:08 <shapr> what's that?
06:20:09 <debug> torii were more efficient
06:20:20 * shapr checks the translator
06:20:24 <debug> because alphas can interconnect in straight lines, north/south/east/west
06:20:57 <debug> I'll try to buy myself an ev7 when I can afford one, just for the sake of it. :)
06:21:08 <debug> but that'll probably not be in the near future
06:21:14 <shapr> I can't find torii
06:21:22 <debug> torus in plural
06:21:28 <shapr> ohh
06:21:31 <shapr> duh :-)
06:22:03 <debug> ev7 was supposed to come out this year, 300 SPECfp95 compared to 13 for the ev4 I'm typing this on
06:32:46 <debug> does haskell have any support for "forcing" data to be represented in some specific way, or is the user never supposed to care about that?
06:32:58 <shapr> what do you mean?
06:33:21 <debug> for example if you have a list of chars, then that would simply be an array of chars (if implemented in C)
06:33:45 <debug> hm
06:33:48 <debug> I don't know what I mean
06:33:53 <debug> :)
06:33:53 <shapr> well
06:34:03 <shapr> there's a Show typeclass
06:34:11 <shapr> that tells you 'how to turn something into a string' mostly
06:34:31 <debug> things like locality of reference... if I go through a list, how do I know that each element is "close" to the next element in the actual implementation?
06:34:45 <shapr> or maybe you mean something like fromIntegral that can turn a number from an Integer into pretty much anything else in the Num typeclass tree
06:34:51 <debug> no
06:35:01 <shapr> oh, you mean in-memory?
06:35:15 <debug> I'm talking about producing code which takes caches and stuff like that into account
06:35:17 <debug> yes
06:35:55 <debug> a linked list might be powerful in the "expressive" sense, but might be slow if the elements are not close to one another in memory
06:35:59 <shapr> well, first of all, the run time system does all that for you...
06:36:10 <shapr> the idea being that you don't have to :-)
06:36:12 <shapr> but if you really want
06:36:23 <shapr> you can create arrays of unboxed Int for example
06:36:35 <shapr> and that's just a raw chunk of memory with a bunch of Int all in a row
06:37:22 <debug> ok
06:37:23 <debug> nice
06:37:36 <shapr> but, that's only for GHC
06:37:43 <shapr> and it won't work in Hugs, or in NHC, or HBC
06:37:59 <shapr> and it's not part of Haskell specifically, just one implementation
06:38:31 <debug> yeah, I've found some stuff on haskell.org now, ghc specific
06:39:08 <shapr> a more general (and common) solution is to use Haskell normally, and then complain if the compiler isn't fast enough
06:39:21 <shapr> usually one of the Simons goes and fixes something and suddenly your program is a lot fater.
06:39:24 <shapr> er "faster"
06:39:28 <shapr> snabbt
06:39:41 * debug pulls his beard
06:39:58 * shapr pulls his ponytail
06:40:02 <debug> ok
06:40:05 <shapr> ow
06:40:12 <debug> unboxed
06:40:13 <debug> hm
06:40:23 <debug> I just thought of this in regards to raytracers
06:40:53 <shapr> I would recommend writing as close to the Haskel 98 standard as possible for any program, and then having some optional speedy code
06:40:56 <debug> if each object is in a linked list, and each object is checked for a hit, and the elements are not close to eachother in memory, then the cache hit/miss statistics will be awful
06:41:07 <debug> ok
06:41:12 <shapr> for instance, the hbc98 runtime system has recently been ported to PalmOS
06:41:27 <shapr> so if your code is pretty close to H98, you'd be amazed where it can run
06:41:29 <Marvin--> man, what a lovely weather
06:41:38 <debug> Marvin--: it is a wonderful day
06:41:43 <shapr> Marvin--: it's grey and rainy here
06:41:58 * shapr tries to anonymously ftp some sunshine from Marvin-- 
06:42:52 <debug> the lecturer in our algorithm course brought up some example of two functions, one taking 1000*n time units and the other taking n^2 time units. his suggestion was of course that we should do the "right thing" and implement the 1000*n function
06:43:14 <debug> my view on the matter is that it should be ok to implement both, and then choose one or the other depending on what n is
06:43:19 <debug> (at runtime)
06:43:23 <shapr> I would agree with that.
06:43:25 <debug> if it is easy to find the threshhold
06:43:54 <debug> so "choosing a good algorithm" doesn't always produce good total performance in practice unless you know what you are using it for
06:44:30 <Marvin--> which lecturer was this? Devdat?
06:44:34 <debug> yes
06:44:43 <debug> we've only had 2 lectures so far
06:44:53 <debug> (I've only been to 1)
06:45:05 <Marvin--> sounds strange that he'd advocate that
06:45:30 <debug> why?
06:45:37 <debug> it has better complexity
06:46:01 <Marvin--> correction, it has *lower* complexity :)
06:46:13 <debug> so from a pure algorithmic (ie non-realworld) perspection, it is better
06:46:15 <debug> ok
06:46:16 <debug> :)
06:46:18 <debug> better :)
06:46:23 <debug> lower :)
06:46:24 <debug> whatever
06:46:52 <debug> but why was it strange?
06:47:17 <Marvin--> there are three things to keep in mind, algorithmic complexity, actual use complexity (i.e. the time it takes when applying it to the problem sizes you want to apply it to) and not to forget, implementation complexity
06:47:40 <Marvin--> because I thought the era where lower complexity == better, no matter what the problem is, was over
06:47:46 <debug> ok. maybe it was just an introduction example, and he didn't have time to go into deeper stuff
06:48:08 <debug> like I said, I've only been to 1 lecture
06:48:09 <Marvin--> I'm pretty sure Damaschke didn't blindly advocate lower complexity when I took the algorithms course
06:48:44 * debug hopes that the course will prove to be interesting further on
06:57:06 * Marvin-- listens to Christian Lindberg playing the trombone
07:02:31 <Marvin--> Johan de Meij's T-Bone Concerto is *good*
07:06:19 * debug feels all warm and cozy as he watches solaris' cc beat gcc -O3
07:11:08 <Marvin--> have you tried Intel's compiler?
07:12:02 <debug> this is on grosse
07:12:19 <Marvin--> oh
07:12:36 <Marvin--> I'm just wondering how much time has been spent on the sparc optimizer in gcc
07:12:36 <debug> code produced with solaris' cc: 4 seconds user time, gcc -O3 and some other flags: 10 seconds
07:13:00 <debug> I'm playing around with data locality in the TSP lab
07:13:01 <Marvin--> what's the difference between gcc -O, gcc -O2 and gcc -O3 then?
07:13:17 <Marvin--> that feels kinda relevant too ;)
07:13:18 <debug> -O2 turns on most optimizations I think that are not a space/time tradeoff
07:13:28 <debug> -O3 are more optimizations
07:14:00 <debug> hm
07:14:59 <debug> it is important that the entire table of distances used in the TSP lab will fit in the cache... but it seems to be ok
07:15:05 <debug> 38*38 ints
07:15:34 <Marvin--> I meant time-wise
07:15:46 <Marvin--> on grosse
07:15:47 <debug> compile time?
07:15:51 <debug> ah
07:16:14 <Marvin--> gcc -O3 was 10 seconds, what about -O2 and -O1 and without optimizations at all?
07:16:23 * debug tries O, O1, O2, and O3...
07:16:58 <debug> acc without -fast -xO5 was not very fast though
07:18:47 <debug> gcc -O 11.3 seconds, gcc -O1 11.3 seconds, gcc -O2 11.1 seconds, gcc -O3 10.1 seconds
07:20:05 <Marvin--> and plain ol' gcc without flags?
07:20:35 <Marvin--> what I'm trying to say is that maybe gcc doesn't optimize for sparc at all, or at least very little
07:21:18 <debug> Marvin--: hopefully there will be some things done, like function inlining, that are backend-independant
07:21:25 <debug> gcc: 20.8 seconds
07:22:25 <debug> acc: 17.44 seconds    acc -fast: 4.35 seconds    acc -xO5: 7.5 seconds     acc -fast -xO5: 4.35 seconds
07:23:02 <opet> news flash!
07:23:07 <debug> so -fast is probably the way to go... it gives a warning though about producing code which is not backward compatible
07:23:16 <opet> gcc performs badly on !(386 linux)
07:23:18 <Marvin--> which is bad
07:23:24 <Marvin--> opet: exactly
07:23:46 * debug likes sparc in a way, but has no fast machines at home
07:24:48 <debug> opet: I don't think linux has anything to do with it :)
07:25:16 <debug> "the whole world is an i386", of course
07:25:41 * debug has two vax-equiped machines on the shelf, so it isn't as ironic as it sounds
07:29:12 <debug> Marvin--: how automatic will the code prover be then?
07:31:48 <shapr> yah, will we have ghc -fproof --make Foo.hs 
07:32:23 <Marvin--> I guess it depends on whether I get that PhD position or not :P
07:32:47 <debug> :)
07:32:58 <debug> but what if the code is _supposed_ to do something which breaks?
07:33:06 <shapr> gee, I wonder if thirty kronor is enough to make a bribe
07:33:13 <shapr> hi BlitzNL, ltns, what's up?
07:33:17 <Marvin--> and the idea is that it will be fully automatic, but restricted to a subset of haskell (that can hopefully be extended in the future)
07:33:33 <Igloo> What will it prove?
07:33:41 <Marvin--> however, because first order logic is only semi-decidable, the prover won't terminate if the program is correct :P
07:33:51 <Marvin--> Igloo: that your program has a bug
07:34:02 <Igloo> So you give it a spec in some other language?
07:34:17 <Marvin--> the spec will hopefully be the quickcheck language
07:34:28 <Igloo> Ah, cool
07:34:36 <Marvin--> so you can either feed the program through quickcheck or the prover
07:34:40 <BlitzNL> hi shapr, It has been quite some time since my last visit here and was wondering if you guys were still alive ;)
07:34:47 <shapr> yes, we're doing well
07:34:57 <Marvin--> BlitzNL: run for your life, we're all undead
07:34:57 <shapr> we have a 'bot too
07:35:03 <shapr> but I'm trying to fix him up right now...
07:35:53 <BlitzNL> shapr: nice, since I moved to a new place and have a 24/7 cable connection now I'll promise to visit more often ;)
07:36:07 <shapr> yay!
07:36:08 <shapr> that's great
07:36:10 <Marvin--> bah, there's no gettext module in ghc?
07:36:15 <shapr> what's gettext?
07:36:28 <Marvin--> i18n stuff
07:36:45 <shapr> oh
07:37:10 <Marvin--> I guess it'd be a mess of IO actions or unsafePerformIO
07:38:00 <debug> hm
07:41:11 * Marvin-- likes System.Console.GetOpt :)
07:42:28 <shapr> hiya esap 
07:43:10 <esap> Hi shapr
07:43:14 <Marvin--> asap?
07:43:23 <shapr> esap == esa p.
07:43:38 <Marvin--> eisa peittä?
07:43:47 <shapr> pulkinnen I think
07:43:52 * esap is Esa Pulkkinen.
07:43:58 <shapr> bah
07:44:00 <shapr> I was close :-)
07:44:36 <Riastradh> Is it just me, or is there a vast number of Scandinavian people (or people who speak languages from Scandinavia) who frequent this channel?
07:44:45 <shapr> jag vet inte
07:44:46 <Marvin--> mmm, ice cream
07:44:49 <shapr> ;-)
07:45:10 <shapr> Riastradh: maybe so...
07:45:25 <shapr> do you speak a scandinavian language?
07:45:33 <Riastradh> Nope.
07:45:40 * shapr owns the domain ScannedInAvian.com
07:46:18 <Riastradh> I'm harbouring a growing desire to learn one, though, merely to understand what you weirdos say in here.
07:46:25 <Marvin--> haha
07:46:30 <debug> hm... there are Mother Scan Meatballs... maybe that scan has to do with scandinavian... or not
07:46:42 <shapr> Riastradh: swedish is simple and fun.
07:46:53 <shapr> Riastradh: finnish is challenging and inveigled, and also fun
07:46:56 * Marvin-- has fond memories of teaching foreigners "proper" Swedish on the mud
07:47:26 <shapr> swedish, danish, and the two flavors of norwegian are closely related
07:47:34 * esap doesn't think finnish is at all fun. It's way too complicated to learn.
07:48:00 <shapr> truly, finnish is difficult to learn, but the agglutinative nature of finnish is quite nifty.
07:48:23 <shapr> saunassanista
07:48:24 <Riastradh> Agglutinative?  I'm now rather terrified of Finnish.
07:48:36 <debug> :)
07:48:52 <shapr> http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?AgglutinativeLanguage
07:49:31 <Marvin--> "Cekoslavakyalilastiramadiklarimizdanmisiniz"
07:49:32 <Marvin--> haha
07:49:53 * Riastradh cowers in terror of Turkish.
07:49:56 <shapr> where does agglutinative fit into programming? 
07:50:09 <Marvin--> not at all, I hope
07:50:23 <shapr> no, it's similar to a programming construct, but I can't figure out which one
07:50:30 <esap> You can have programming languages where you do not need whitespace :-)
07:50:32 <shapr> it's like partial application or something
07:50:34 <Riastradh> Perl -- $foo, \&foo, $$foo, et cetera.
07:50:46 <debug> maybe it's like the predicate flags of Itanium
07:50:51 <shapr> maybe those are all combinators :-)
07:50:54 <debug> the finns are way ahead of the rest of the world
07:51:34 * debug imagines the word "sauna" plus an "overflow"-flag
07:51:54 <shapr> you can say "at" with the "ssa" flag
07:52:00 <shapr> saunassa <-- at the sauna
07:52:07 <shapr> mine is the "ni" flag
07:52:11 <debug> like locative then
07:52:17 <shapr> saunassani <-- at my sauna
07:52:19 <debug> in slavic languages
07:52:29 <shapr> though I may hav the flag order wrong
07:52:42 <shapr> that's about as far as I got before I moved to sweden.
07:52:46 <debug> :)
07:53:10 <shapr> you have seventeen different 'flags' only fifteen of which are commonly used
07:53:21 <shapr> if you apply fifteen possible flags to a word..
07:53:49 <Janni> hi
07:53:51 <shapr> y0
07:53:58 * debug wonders how T9 word completion works in Finnish
07:54:04 <shapr> T9 ?
07:54:09 <debug> mobile phone stuff
07:54:16 <shapr> oh
07:54:25 <Marvin--> heh, ouch
07:54:28 * shapr dunno
07:54:29 <esap> it works fine, if you just had a good finnish dictionary.
07:54:43 <shapr> maybe my dictionary just sucked.
07:54:49 <shapr> or it could also have been user error
07:54:49 <debug> or tab-completion. "sauna" + tab   "There are 18419 entries, do you wish to see them?"  ;)
07:54:57 * shapr grins
07:55:02 <Riastradh> Haha.
07:55:29 <shapr> on the other hand, I think finnish is sort of like Haskell, the top end goes past the clouds
07:55:43 <shapr> you get a lot of power for that initial complexity
08:03:53 <dbg> can somebody explain me why expression 'length $! [1/0]' doesn't lead to division by zero error? i understand why 'length [1/0]' doesn't. but $! should make [1/0] evaluated before length applied. am i missing something?
08:04:26 <shapr> it's possible that the items in the list are just thunks
08:04:38 <shapr> they're just items, never to be evaluated, just counted
08:04:48 <esap> $! is not deepSeq
08:06:06 * shapr tries to intersperse ", " into IO [[Char]]
08:06:38 <dbg> esap: hmm. what is deepSeq and how it is different from $!? RTFM-style answer is ok provided URL to FM is given :)
08:07:06 <Janni> dbg: RTFM! -> google.com ;)
08:07:28 <esap> dbg: there was some discussion on deepSeq on the Haskell mailing list.
08:08:12 <Marvin--> > length $! ((:) $! ((/) $! 1) $! 0) $! []
08:08:12 <Marvin--> Program error: {primDivDouble 1.0 0.0}
08:08:15 * Marvin-- coughs
08:08:54 <debug> hm
08:08:59 <esap> dbg: deepSeq is a way of evaluating an expression "fully" in eager evaluation style.
08:09:23 <Marvin--> if you $! every application, it works :-)
08:10:02 <dbg> Marvin--: aha. do you mean that nonstrictness of : constructor prevents 1/0 to be evaluated in my example?
08:10:17 <Marvin--> yes
08:11:22 <dbg> i see now. thanks.
08:12:12 <Marvin--> length (((:) $! (1/0)) [])  is actually enough
08:13:37 <dbg> yes. head-strict (:) application is enough.
08:14:05 <shapr> well, lambdabot can return multiple rows from a factoid now

08:14:48 <shapr> yes
08:14:52 <Marvin--> neato
08:14:56 <Igloo> Cool
08:15:07 <shapr> overkill for a factoid plugin, but I wanted to do something interesting with postgresql and Haskell
08:15:17 <Marvin--> overkill isn't always bad :)
08:15:23 <shapr> sadly, it opens a new connection, statement, etc for each lookup or entry
08:15:59 <Marvin--> put the connection in the state monad?
08:15:59 <shapr> I have no idea how to stuff a persistent DB connection into a bunch of stacked monad transformers
08:16:27 <shapr> I'll try that after I add factoid deletion
08:16:28 <Marvin--> I like using a record as state and only have one StateT transformer
08:16:36 <Marvin--> no need to have three zillion lift:s
08:16:53 * shapr watches that go way way over his head
08:17:00 <shapr> :-)
08:17:17 <Marvin--> shapr: you ought to come here and take the AFP in fall .-)
08:17:23 <shapr> great idea!
08:17:31 <shapr> I wonder if my contract work would allow for that...
08:17:40 <Marvin--> doubtful
08:17:44 <shapr> all of my clients are in other countries anyway
08:17:52 <shapr> I wonder if I could afford a decent laptop
08:18:05 <Marvin--> your clients are in other countries... so... why are you in Sweden? :)
08:18:34 <shapr> in short, because physical location is more important to Bea than it is to me.
08:18:52 <Marvin--> ah, she got a job in Sweden?
08:18:57 <shapr> no
08:19:02 <shapr> neither of us have work in sweden :-)
08:19:07 <Marvin--> uhm
08:19:15 <Marvin--> ...right
08:19:34 <shapr> well, Bea's best friend lives here with her sambo
08:19:39 <shapr> and her sambo runs an ISP
08:19:51 <Marvin--> eek
08:20:04 <shapr> so as physical locations went, this was better than anything else.
08:20:16 <shapr> plus I wanted to learn swedish.
08:20:57 <shapr> I grew up in Alabama, every day I spend in Europe is like another day of a great adventure :-)
08:21:25 <shapr> I'm a drifter.. a codeslinger for hire ;-)

08:31:21 <Marvin--> shapr: it's not very multi-lineish though
08:31:34 <shapr> that's true.
08:31:49 * Marvin-- tries to figure out what he did yesterday so he can write something in the diary
08:31:54 <shapr> I haven't figured out how to get intersperse ", " to work on IO [[Char]]
08:32:08 <shapr> but I figure that's cosmetic anyway
08:32:24 <Igloo> You need to liftM it once or twice
08:32:42 <Igloo> Once
08:32:49 <Marvin--> liftM (intersperse ", ")
08:32:55 <shapr> oh
08:33:00 <shapr> that'll lift the ", " also?
08:33:11 <Marvin--> that'll lift the function  intersperse ", "
08:33:11 <Igloo> It lifts the function intersperse ", "
08:33:17 <shapr> it was complaing that I was trying to mix IO [Char] items into an IO [[Char]] list
08:33:17 <Marvin--> Igloo: get out of my head ;)

08:37:02 <lambdabot>  Ian Lynagh,  Template Haskell Guru
08:37:07 <ludde> I get "Exception: mu"
08:37:08 <shapr> yay!
08:37:25 <shapr> I think error actually generates an error
08:37:53 <ludde> but i want to be able to catch it
08:38:06 <Marvin--> ludde: try failIO instead
08:38:07 <shapr> isn't there a catch function?
08:38:18 <ludde> that's what "try" did, i though
08:38:21 <ludde> thought.
08:38:40 <Marvin--> there are a few error/fail functions and a few try/catch functions in different modules that work differently, it's very confusing
08:40:09 <ludde> I need an error catcher that is compatible with throwTo in the concurrent module
08:40:35 <Marvin--> haven't used it
08:41:43 <Marvin--> heh, I don't parse the prelude and stuff yet, so you have to define data types for lists and tuples yourself
08:41:58 <Marvin--> but I do parse the syntactic sugar :P
08:46:46 <ludde> ok
08:46:52 <ludde> catchException works
08:46:54 <ludde> catch doesn't
08:47:09 <ludde> on http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/base/GHC.Exception.html
08:47:19 <ludde> i don't really see the difference between them though
08:47:26 <ludde> cause there's no documentation
08:50:47 <Marvin--> no, this is very unclear
09:00:19 <shapr> bonjour Rapiere 
09:00:24 <Rapiere> bonjour shapr 
09:00:33 <shapr> comment ça va?
09:00:45 <Rapiere> l'envie de voir les autres canaux en cette fin d'après-midi... je me demandais si #haskell était populaire :)
09:01:00 <Rapiere> bien merci, et toi-meme ? seul ici ?
09:01:01 * shapr tries to stop thinking in swedish for a bit
09:01:46 <shapr> je vais tres bien aussi, merci
09:02:23 <shapr> umm
09:02:24 <shapr> argh
09:02:42 <Marvin--> is "argh" swedish or french?
09:02:43 * Rapiere thought you were french at first..
09:02:55 <shapr> Rapiere: I've been learning swedish the last three months, I can't pull up my french, quelle dommage
09:03:08 <shapr> Marvin--: that's pure USA ;-)
09:03:28 <shapr> Rapiere: j'habite avec une jolie femme francaise
09:03:34 <Rapiere> it seems people coming here love strange languages :)
09:03:44 <Rapiere> toutes mes félicitations :)
09:03:45 <shapr> elle est aussi allemagne
09:04:31 <mgoetze> ja, deutsch!
09:04:37 <shapr> parlez vous swedish? ;-)
09:04:57 <Rapiere> malheureusement, non.
09:05:07 * mgoetze ne peut rien de francais.
09:05:21 <shapr> ah well,
09:05:50 * shapr looks up canaux
09:06:17 <shapr> Rapiere: are you new to Haskell? or a long-time user?
09:07:15 <Rapiere> shapr: really new... was looking for a language good at dealing with time series... I remembered that my compiler's teacher was in love with Haskell... so I'm just coming looking around.
09:08:01 <shapr> what's a time series?
09:08:47 <Rapiere> a serie of periodic data, like market stocks : you have a value per market's day.
09:09:26 <shapr> what do you want to do with your time series?
09:10:34 <Rapiere> analyse it, like calculating fast "average 30 days" (I don't know the english translation of "moyenne mobile sur 30 jours")
09:11:14 <mgoetze> Rapiere: close... "30-day-average" :)
09:11:33 <shapr> Rapiere: which programming languages have you used before?
09:11:38 <Rapiere> K is a functional language pretending to be very fast at it, however it's not free, there's not so much documentation about it, quite nebulous.... however OCaml and Haskell are well known
09:11:45 <Rapiere> thanks mgoetze :)
09:12:09 <Rapiere> common lisp, caml, pascal, c, a bit of c++, php, x85, x86, etc...
09:12:20 <shapr> OCaml is fast, and from inria.fr I think, Haskell is not quite so fast, but is purely functional
09:12:58 <shapr> if you like pure FP, Haskell is a good choice.
09:13:10 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact haskell
09:13:10 <lambdabot>  http://www.haskell.org/
09:13:15 <Rapiere> how being a pure functional language is an advantage over other languages ?
09:13:42 <Rapiere> yes, the Haskell's site is really nice, full of documentation, links..
09:14:23 <shapr> I think that pure FP makes for more elegant code, more expressiveness
09:15:07 <shapr> I don't know if it will have any benefits for time series over a matrix oriented language
09:15:24 <mgoetze> shapr: you mean like matlab?
09:15:39 <shapr> yah
09:15:43 <shapr> or octave
09:15:54 <shapr> those are specifically designed for that sort of work
09:15:54 <Rapiere> In fact I was thinking of a functional language generating optimized low level code (like FFTW)
09:16:06 <shapr> there is a Haskell binding for FFTW
09:16:08 <shapr> and for MPI
09:16:58 <Rapiere> are you coding in Haskell for fun, or professionnaly ?
09:17:05 <shapr> currently I do it for fun
09:17:10 <shapr> but I'm planning world domination.
09:17:29 <shapr> I do plan on moving towards professional Haskell coding.
09:17:42 <shapr> I'm working on tools and libraries right now

09:20:20 <shapr> right now lambdabot is in the cvs tree of http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/
09:20:21 <Rapiere> how fast is it generating the mandelbrot ?
09:20:48 <shapr> last I heard, compiled Haskell is about seven times slower than C
09:21:00 <shapr> though of course that depends on a lot of other stuff
09:21:27 <Igloo> What's that based on?
09:21:38 <shapr> Igloo: something someone said on the mailing lists...
09:21:43 <shapr> could be totally wrong :-)
09:21:46 <Igloo> Hmmm, cv
09:21:48 <Rapiere> I've seen you're using SQL code too, are there ODBC or MySQL libs too ?

09:35:51 <shapr> Marvin--: any ideas that aren't mentioned there?
09:36:42 <Marvin--> I only glanced at it, the only thing I've ever interacted with bots on channels was op and stuff
09:37:44 <Marvin--> and silly things like megahal of course
09:54:15 <dbg> is there way to always force strict evaluation for some function argument? i see a silly way: f x = if x == x then result else result where result = do_actual_work. is there more elegant way to assert that function argument should be strictly evaluated?
09:55:04 <shapr> I've heard of deepSeq and $!
09:55:06 <shapr> but I haven't used them
09:57:32 <Marvin--> dbg: you can insert strictness annotations in data type definitions, but I don't know if you can simply put them in function type signatures
09:57:35 <Marvin--> Clean supports this, I think
09:58:09 <Marvin--> or I thought you could anyway
09:59:07 <Marvin--> data MyInt = MyInt !Int
09:59:11 <dbg> Marvin--: i know about stricness annotation for datatype constructors. i wonder does similiar feature exists for functions.
09:59:39 <Marvin--> that's what I wonder too
09:59:50 <Marvin--> my guess would be "no"
10:01:30 <dbg> then i probably should ask "why". i think that it would be usefull. code with $! scattered around looks like perl source.

10:11:11 * shapr is just trying "splitter str = foldl (fst $ genericSplitAt) $ findIndices (== '\'') str"
10:11:28 <shapr> there must be a simpler way
10:14:41 <Igloo> concatMap foo where foo '/' = "\\'"; foo x = [x]
10:14:52 <Igloo> IM \', not /
10:15:00 * shapr blinks
10:15:55 <Igloo> It's basically   concat . map (\x -> [x])   (which is id) with a special case
10:16:11 <Igloo> And using concatMap saves 3 characters  :-)
10:16:16 <shapr> heheh
10:16:19 * shapr bounces happily
10:18:00 <shapr> truly, that is a much simpler solution than anything I was thinking of 
10:23:32 <shapr> ok, now safely escapes single ticks
10:23:40 <whee> how was that a problem?
10:24:00 <shapr> I'm doing sql queries
10:24:06 <whee> oh, yuck :)
10:24:22 <shapr> well, I wanted to use Postgresql and Haskell together somehow :-)
10:24:36 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact foo'bar
10:24:36 <lambdabot>  baz'quux
10:24:40 <shapr> yay
10:54:22 <shapr> lambdabot: @foo
10:54:22 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know that command.
10:54:26 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact foo
10:54:34 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact foo bar
10:54:34 <lambdabot> set foo to bar
10:54:40 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact delete foo
10:54:41 <lambdabot> deleted foo
10:54:43 <shapr> yay!
10:55:01 <shapr> and I added whitespace trimming while I was at it.
10:55:43 <jlouis> heh
10:55:57 <shapr> hm, what next?
10:56:07 <Igloo> Take over the world!
10:56:10 <jlouis> rewrite into SML :)
10:56:44 <Igloo> Heretic!
10:56:53 <shapr> heheh
10:56:57 * Marvin-- smites the infidel
10:57:14 <jlouis> Haskell sucks, sorry
10:57:26 <shapr> why are you here then? hm?
10:57:41 <shapr> our immense coolness has sucked you in against your better judgement ;-)
10:57:46 <jlouis> You know, the foul priest...
10:57:58 <shapr> nyalathotep?
10:58:04 <shapr> er "nyarlathotep?"
10:58:09 <shapr> shub-niggurath?
10:58:13 <jlouis> hehe
10:58:28 <jlouis> You will all be converted to the strict church!
10:58:46 <shapr> when I get around to it ;-)
10:58:46 * Igloo wonders if jloius is seriously pro-ML
10:58:58 <jlouis> more generally, I think Haskell is too complex
10:59:08 <Igloo> Haskell '98?
10:59:12 <jlouis> yes
10:59:45 <jlouis> that said, I prefer Haskell over most other languages
10:59:50 <shapr> Rapiere: any new questions?
11:00:10 * shapr is tempted to /nick main-gauche
11:01:55 <shapr> Marvin--: you think I'm qualified to attend the AFP? do you think it would be over my head?
11:03:56 <Marvin--> shapr: well, it'd be tricky to get course credit for it, but yes I think you'd be qualified to take the course
11:04:31 <shapr> I'm not so picky about course credit, I just want to learn stuff
11:04:34 <shapr> ok, cool
11:05:20 <shapr> I hope the nhc98 runtime for the PalmOS has been released by then =)
11:05:35 <Marvin--> the general contents of the course is embedded languages, and monads as a case study of that
11:05:38 <shapr> I take notes on my Palm IIIc in swedish class, since I have keyboard for my Palm
11:06:39 <shapr> sounds like fun :-)
11:07:36 <Rapiere> shapr: sorry, was busy with my french fiscal declaration..
11:07:47 <shapr> pas de problem
11:19:53 <shapr> what's a good .cvsignore for haskell projects?
11:20:02 <shapr> *.hi *.o anything else?
11:21:53 * shapr boings
11:22:07 <kunphuzil> Hmm.. I know you guys will probably give me a biased answer.. but which would you rather learn first? Haskell or Lisp?
11:22:25 <shapr> I'd go for the biased answer.
11:22:36 <shapr> kunphuzil: actually, it depends on what you're trying to learn.
11:22:51 <shapr> I wanted to learn about "functional programming" as much as possible
11:22:59 <shapr> and Haskell is the 'most functional' language around
11:23:07 <shapr> lambdabot: @haskell
11:23:07 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know that command.
11:23:10 <shapr> oops
11:23:12 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: scheme :)
11:23:14 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact haskell
11:23:14 <lambdabot>  http://www.haskell.org/
11:23:27 * shapr bounces happily
11:23:40 <kunphuzil> Hmm.. Just some people in #ypn tell me to learn Lisp, others Haskell. Dunno.
11:23:50 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: so learn scheme :)
11:24:09 <shapr> kunphuzil: why not spend one or two days starting with each one of them, and then go with whichever you prefer?
11:24:48 <esap> I think the most important thing to remember when learning languages is that you do not try to learn just one language.
11:24:55 <shapr> yah, I agree with esap 
11:25:05 <shapr> learn lots of languages
11:25:20 <mgoetze> yeah, and make sure to learn perl :)
11:25:45 <shapr> because programming is a skill that hides on the other side of knowing several languages
11:26:15 <shapr> I think I'm going for mercury or prolog after I'm fluent with Haskell.
11:27:23 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact learning http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
11:27:23 <lambdabot> set learning to http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
11:27:42 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact help see @author @source
11:27:42 <lambdabot> set help to see @author @source
11:30:08 <kunphuzil> hmm. i will eventually (i'd hope) learn both Lisp and Haskell. don't know which i will learn first though
11:30:13 <dbg> kunphuzil: it happened that i learned lisp first. it was long before haskell was invented (i believe). now i'm learning haskell and my previos experience with lisp really helps. but still it is different language and i occasionally get stuck on few obstacles namely pure IO and type system. if i had an option i'd learn haskell first. i think haskell->lisp transition is easier than lisp->haskell.
11:30:13 <mgoetze> lambdabot: @author
11:30:14 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know that command.
11:30:26 <mgoetze> lambdabot: @fact help

11:30:35 <lambdabot>  http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/
11:30:40 <shapr> mgoetze: oops
11:30:46 <kunphuzil> dbg: ok. thanks
11:30:47 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact delete help
11:30:47 <lambdabot> deleted help
11:30:55 <shapr> I need to clean up the fact syntax
11:31:15 * esap just made a mistake: I started openoffice at the same time with building ghc :-)
11:31:30 <shapr> yow
11:31:48 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: thing about lisp/scheme is, you can learn all sorts of programming paradigmas with them
11:32:06 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: with haskell, you learn only functional programming, but you learn it properly :)
11:32:34 <kunphuzil> hmm
11:32:43 <kunphuzil> well, i will learn both. i think i will learn haskell first though.
11:32:53 <shapr> welcome to Haskell
11:32:54 <shapr> w00
11:32:55 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: yeah, and learn scheme after that :)
11:36:13 <kunphuzil> what kinds of things has haskell done?
11:36:24 <kunphuzil> like.. Common Lisp was used to make Mario
11:36:28 <shapr> you mean, what kind of apps have been written in Haskell?
11:36:31 <kunphuzil> yeah
11:36:34 <shapr> lambdabot is written in Haskell
11:36:36 <shapr> lambdabot: hi
11:36:36 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet.
11:36:56 <shapr> lambdabot's factoid support uses postgresql
11:36:57 <kunphuzil> Does it get smarter?
11:36:59 <shapr> sure
11:37:02 <shapr> write a plugin :-)
11:37:21 <kunphuzil> what else?
11:37:29 <shapr> the GHC compiler is written in Haskell
11:37:42 <shapr> the Bluecode hardware specification compiler is written in Haskell 
11:37:51 <shapr> Lava, Hawk, and some other hardware design programs
11:38:07 <shapr> it has various gui toolkit bindings
11:39:22 <esap> There is a some kind of list of applications written in Haskell at haskell.org
11:39:28 <shapr> yup
11:40:20 <kunphuzil> Well.. I guess I'll learn haskell. (heh.. I am so undecisive, and not just about this.) 
11:41:15 <shapr> heh :-)
11:56:20 <shapr> hm, can I nest guards?
11:58:36 <Igloo> No
11:58:45 <shapr> ok
12:02:34 <creature> Can't you do it kind-of with the where statement? 
12:02:37 <kunphuzil> who is the l337est haskeller in here? :)
12:08:15 <Janni> kunphuzil: i think haskellers generally aren't 1337. (fortunately)
12:08:47 <kunphuzil> in the topic it says the logs are on tunes, is haskell involved in the tunes project?
12:11:42 <kunphuzil> Gentle Intro to Haskell is the most recommended tutorial?
12:14:11 <creature> kunphuzil - You're just about to start learning Haskell, yes? 
12:15:14 <kunphuzil> yeah
12:15:48 <BlitzNL>  kunphuzil: I read several different intros, but liked this book by one of my profs most ; http://www.cs.uu.nl/~jeroen/courses/fp-eng.pdf
12:15:49 <creature> I've got some code snippets on the web that might help you. 
12:16:02 <creature> Some files I've made when coding stuff whilst learning. 
12:16:08 <creature> I can PM you the url to them, if you like.
12:16:20 <BlitzNL> creature: I'd like that too
12:17:24 <creature> www.alexpounds.com/code.tar.gz
12:17:52 <kunphuzil> thanks guys
12:18:47 <BlitzNL> no
12:18:54 <BlitzNL> problem
12:18:54 <kunphuzil> BlitzNL: ?
12:18:57 <kunphuzil> oh, heh
12:19:06 <BlitzNL> yeah sorry i meanted np, ofcourse ;)
12:31:41 <Janni> kunphuzil: The best tutorial for beginners I know: http://www.cs.ou.edu/cs1323h/textbook/haskell.shtml
12:31:59 <kunphuzil> Thanks. i will read all the tutorials :D
12:50:16 <mgoetze> Janni: speaking of tutorials, how about some go? :)
13:10:56 <Marvin--> man, this is bad
13:16:21 <Janni> mgoetze: yay! I'm as good as last time we played :)
13:21:14 <kunphuzil> Janni: That link is not working for me.
13:24:31 <Janni> kunphuzil: it isn't working for me neither. it's down. but you can get it from ftp://rochel.dyndns.org/
13:24:39 <kunphuzil> Ok
13:25:18 <Janni> but it's only one of two parts. I don't have the part with the answers to the questions of the first part
13:25:48 <kunphuzil> Janni: That link isn't working either.
13:25:57 <kunphuzil> What is it titled? Maybe Google can help.
13:26:23 <Janni> kunphuzil: no. it's my local machine
13:26:39 <Janni> knuphuzil: err. it's because of your client (and because of my restrictions)
13:26:58 <Janni> kunphuzil: what OS are you using? if it's a unix use wget or ftp
13:27:16 <kunphuzil> Ok
13:27:42 <kunphuzil> Hmm. ftp: ftp://rochel.dyndns.org/: Unknown host
13:29:31 <Janni> kunphuzil: that is strange...
13:29:33 <ludde> is there some way to search for a small string inside a large string? (like C's substr())
13:29:51 <mgoetze> Janni: kgs.igoweb.org -> download java client -> connect -> room "deutsche ecke"
13:30:09 <Janni> mgoetze: forget it. I just _don't know_ how to play go
13:30:30 <debug> hm
13:30:39 <Janni> ludde: generalize your problem
13:30:47 <kunphuzil> Hm.. I remember hearing Haskellers are obsessed with Go or something?
13:31:14 <ludde> Janni: basically what I want is: contains :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
13:31:55 <Janni> kunphuzil: try pD9E39E2E.dip.t-dialin.net. it really should work
13:32:31 <mgoetze> Janni: i vill be teaching j00
13:32:37 <Igloo> xs `contains` ys = any (ys `isPrefixOf`) (tails xs)
13:32:39 <Janni> ludde: exactly. I once implemented isSublistOf by using isPrefixOf from the List-module
13:32:47 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: some of us :)
13:32:52 <Igloo> Unless i have something the wrong way round
13:32:58 <kunphuzil> mgoetze: Why is that?
13:33:10 <Janni> Igloo: yes. it has to be "contains xs ys = ..."
13:33:29 <kunphuzil> Janni: HTTP or FTP?
13:33:35 <Igloo> xs `contains` ys is a valid left hand side
13:33:36 <Janni> ftp
13:33:39 <kunphuzil> ok
13:33:49 <Janni> Igloo: oh? *testing*
13:34:03 <Igloo> Just like a + b is
13:34:33 <Janni> oh yeah. I didn't know that you can _define_ functions in that way
13:35:40 <kunphuzil> Janni: What is the file name?
13:36:15 <Janni> kunphuzil: pub/twoDznQ.ps
13:36:27 <kunphuzil> Janni: That is what I thought, just making sure. Thanks.
13:36:51 <kunphuzil> Hmm.. I seem to have forgotton how I get the file.. ;)
13:37:31 <Janni> kunphuzil: with the "ftp" program? "cd pub" and "get twoDznQ.ps"
13:37:45 <kunphuzil> Ah.. Doi. Get
13:47:30 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: i haven't quite figured it out yet
13:48:02 <kunphuzil> mgoetze: Go?
13:58:04 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: well, no, i haven't figured that out either :) but i meant the connection between computer junkies and go junkies
13:58:43 <mgoetze> kunphuzil: it seems to work both ways, in fact... more than half of my local go group deals with computers profesionally or close to it
13:59:01 <kunphuzil> Heh.
14:47:32 <kunphuzil> What's a nym? =)
14:48:05 <Marvin--> have you read Robert Jordan?
14:48:16 <Marvin--> his books have Nym in them
14:48:19 <Marvin--> or one anyway
14:48:33 <kunphuzil> Nope, can't say I have.
14:48:45 <Pseudonym> Nym is a game played with piles of tokens.
14:48:59 <Pseudonym> Or is that Nim?
14:49:23 <Pseudonym> debug, did you see the changes I made to your raytracer?
14:49:40 <kunphuzil> Well.. I just asked because your nick is Pseudonym. So I was wondering what you a false of. ;)
14:49:46 <Marvin--> That's Nim
14:50:06 <Pseudonym> kunphuzil, it's clear you know half of Greek extremely well.
14:50:18 <kunphuzil> Pseudonym: lol.
14:52:04 <Pseudonym> It's actually not a Pseudo-nym, but a Pseudo-onym.
14:52:17 * Pseudonym just looked it up in his LSJ
14:52:35 <kunphuzil> LSJ?
14:52:47 <Pseudonym> Liddel Scott Jones
14:52:54 <Pseudonym> Greek-English Lexicon
14:53:00 <kunphuzil> Oh, cool.
14:53:04 <Pseudonym> Liddell, sorry.
14:53:11 <Pseudonym> Interesting, actually.
14:53:24 <Pseudonym> Henry George Liddell was this great scholar of classical Greek.
14:53:40 <Pseudonym> His life's work was this lexicon used by classicists everywhere.
14:54:10 <Pseudonym> One Oxford mathematician puts his daughter in a book and she ends up more famous than he ever was.
14:54:43 <shapr> Pseudonym: heee
14:54:46 <shapr> heey
14:54:48 <Pseudonym> G'day.
14:54:57 <shapr> have you seen the factoid plugin?
14:55:05 <Pseudonym> Now the prize question: Who was his daughter?
14:55:08 <Pseudonym> No using google.
14:55:19 <Pseudonym> No, haven
14:55:21 <shapr> esther dyson?
14:55:22 <Pseudonym> No, haven't yet.
14:55:23 <Pseudonym> Nope.
14:55:28 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact author

14:56:08 <Pseudonym> No recursive fun here.
14:56:13 <shapr> Pseudonym: it even uses PostgreSQL :-)
14:56:21 * Pseudonym laughs
14:56:24 <Pseudonym> Well, why not?
14:56:27 * shapr grins
14:57:27 <shapr> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot/FactModule.hs?rev=1.3&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
14:58:12 <shapr> hackish, but functional
14:58:24 <Pseudonym> Of course it's functional.
14:58:25 <Pseudonym> Duh.
14:58:35 * shapr laughs
14:58:42 <Pseudonym> You walked right into that one.
14:58:48 <shapr> yes I did
14:59:24 * Marvin-- is in a comment, yay
14:59:32 <Pseudonym> BTW, "sticky" modules are those that can't be unloaded.
14:59:51 <kunphuzil> reverse ".looc si lleksaH" :D
14:59:55 <Pseudonym> When you put the join/leave/quit commands in a module, that should probably be sticky.
15:00:19 <shapr> oh
15:00:19 <Pseudonym> Hey, I can spam shapr's server!
15:00:22 <shapr> yow
15:00:26 <Fractal> Is anyone on this channel involved in that haskell user libraries thing?
15:00:32 <shapr> Fractal: I think so
15:00:39 * Pseudonym tells lambdabot to load "War and Peace" as factoids line-by-line
15:00:39 <shapr> Fractal: I heard that Pseudonym is involved in it.
15:00:48 <Pseudonym> Vaguely, yes.
15:00:49 <Fractal> Thanks.
15:00:58 <Pseudonym> I heard shapr had something to do with it, too.
15:01:08 <shapr> it's true, I am involved.
15:01:14 <Fractal> I could submit something. Are the files on this page in proper format, etc? www.hcsw.org/haskell/
15:01:31 <Pseudonym> There's a proper format?
15:01:36 <Fractal> I don't know...
15:01:40 <shapr> hey, I was about to ask that...
15:01:44 <Fractal> Heh that's why I'm asking..
15:01:50 <shapr> Fractal: would you like cvs commit privs?
15:01:54 <Fractal> I've GPL'd them...
15:02:03 <shapr> do you have a userid for sf.net?
15:02:06 <Pseudonym> They give out cvs commit privs in boxes of cereal nowadays.
15:02:09 <Fractal> Er, no I don't..
15:02:11 <shapr> Pseudonym: :-P
15:02:22 <shapr> Pseudonym: only for people who have actually written Haskell code I think.
15:02:23 <Fractal> I probably don't need CVS privs either
15:02:42 <shapr> Fractal: the original idea for haskell-libs was something like a cvs-wiki
15:02:46 <mgoetze> lambdabot: @fact ghc
15:03:02 <shapr> where you could stick random bits of Haskell code and maybe other people would find them useful
15:03:03 <Pseudonym> The answer to the prize question, BTW, is that his daughter was Alice Liddell.  The book, of course, being "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".
15:03:09 <shapr> aha
15:03:20 <Fractal> Oh ya.. Cool.
15:03:25 <Pseudonym> If you have a look at the poem at the end of "Through the Looking Glass":
15:03:27 <Pseudonym> ftp://sailor.gutenberg.org/pub/gutenberg/etext91/lglass18.txt
15:03:38 <Pseudonym> Take the first letter of each line and it spells her name.
15:03:49 <kunphuzil> Pseudonym: Oh.. Interesting. 
15:04:08 <kunphuzil> Project Gutenburge is cool.
15:04:14 <shapr> Fractal: if you'd like to a developer for haskell-libs, I can add you.
15:04:35 <Pseudonym> Project Gutenburg is uber-cool.
15:04:35 <shapr> Fractal: thanks for the code, I'll add them right now.
15:05:17 <Pseudonym> A general crypto library would be useful.
15:05:17 <Fractal> shapr : No, I'm not actively developping really... If I write anymore, I'll consider it... Thanks for adding them.
15:05:22 <Fractal> Ya agreed.
15:05:22 <shapr> ok, sure
15:05:36 <Pseudonym> Might think up an abstraction layer.
15:05:44 <shapr> Pseudonym: yah, go for it...
15:05:50 <Pseudonym> Not necessarily me. :-)
15:06:00 <shapr> give it a plugin interface ;-)
15:06:03 <Marvin--> heh, hsopenssl?
15:06:04 <Pseudonym> Hell, let's just implement X.509.
15:06:06 <Fractal> Yeah, that would be good. I noticed some other guy did a DES implementation too...
15:06:10 <shapr> Pseudonym: actually...
15:06:24 <shapr> Dominic Steinitz wrote a LDAP client at least
15:06:30 <Pseudonym> Yes.
15:06:36 * Pseudonym wants a Z39.50 interface
15:06:38 <shapr> and it has some relatively sexy ASN.1 support last I looked
15:06:57 <Pseudonym> Isn't someone working on an OpenPGP implementation?
15:07:01 <shapr> much simpler than the Java ASN.1 code I worked on last.
15:07:06 <shapr> I dunno
15:07:11 <Marvin--> wouldn't TH help with generating ASN.1 data types?
15:07:13 <shapr> I think I did hear something about that.
15:07:18 <shapr> Marvin--: very much so
15:07:26 * Marvin-- is scared of what TH can do
15:07:28 <shapr> not me
15:07:36 <shapr> I'm just desperate to get my hands on it!
15:08:06 <Pseudonym> Marvin, I don't think so necessarily.
15:08:09 <shapr> the POWER!
15:08:10 <shapr> w00
15:08:14 <kunphuzil> Hmm. A lot of these guides say I should be farmiliar with functional programming in general, where are some good tutorials about that?
15:08:26 <Pseudonym> Maybe.
15:08:28 <shapr> kunphuzil: I say jump in, the water's fine ;-)
15:08:32 * Pseudonym hmms
15:08:35 <kunphuzil> Ok.
15:08:53 <kunphuzil> That is what I did. Just asking to see if I should have done something else.
15:09:02 <Marvin--> I mean, ASN.1 is just a language for describing an encoding in bytes...
15:09:23 <shapr> the encodings are separate
15:09:32 <Pseudonym> Yes.
15:09:35 <shapr> DER, BER, PER, XER
15:09:39 <Marvin--> well, yes
15:09:39 <Pseudonym> ASN.1 is jsut an language for describing a syntax.
15:09:42 <shapr> XER is my favorite.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> There's one problem with XER.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> If you put in a !DOCTYPE, it's no longer valid XER.
15:13:50 <shapr> just one? ;-)
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> XER is pretty nice apart from that.
15:13:50 <shapr> imho, TH would be good for describing the encodings
15:13:50 <shapr> deriving DER
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> I think Tom Conway started an ASN.1 binding for Haskell, too.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> I think he hacked the back-end of snacc.
15:13:50 <shapr> I haven't heard of that, do you have an url?
15:13:50 <shapr> heh
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> No.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> He has the cubicle opposite mine.
15:13:50 <shapr> oh!
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> That's how I heard about it. :-)
15:13:50 <Marvin--> eek, cubicles
15:13:50 * Pseudonym will ask him how far he got
15:13:50 <kunphuzil> Where do you work, Pseudonym?
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> Good question.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> As far as you're concerned, I work for InQuirion.
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> But really I work for RMIT University.
15:13:50 <kunphuzil> What do you do there?
15:13:50 <Pseudonym> I work on this: http://www.teratext.com.au/
15:13:50 <kunphuzil> You're in Australia?
15:13:50 * Pseudonym nods
15:14:05 <kunphuzil> What exactly is your job on that project? Do you code?
15:14:13 <Pseudonym> Yes.
15:14:15 <Pseudonym> I hack C++.
15:14:20 <kunphuzil> :/
15:14:35 <Pseudonym> I work on the database server.
15:14:37 <Marvin--> do Australians call the northern hemisphere "up above"? :)
15:14:44 <Pseudonym> Err... no.
15:14:57 <Pseudonym> BTW, the term "down under" includes New Zealand.
15:15:04 <Marvin--> I know
15:15:08 * Pseudonym thought he'd mention it
15:15:11 <Marvin--> do they say "up above"? :)
15:15:24 <Pseudonym> Before you ask, our toilets don't use a swirling motion for the water at all.
15:15:36 <Pseudonym> The water goes straight down.
15:15:48 <Marvin--> :)
15:16:03 * Marvin-- likes that Simpsons episode
15:16:10 <kunphuzil> Someone told me that it shoots up out of the toilet instead of down the toilet.
15:16:16 <Pseudonym> However, the wave, at sporting stadiums, does indeed go the other way around.
15:16:51 <Marvin--> the US embassy in australia had a special-made toilet that forced the swirl in the opposite, northern-hemisphere direction :P
15:18:24 <Pseudonym> You know, a lot of Australians complained about that episode.
15:18:25 <kunphuzil> Marvin--: Seriously?
15:18:42 <Pseudonym> About the "unrealistic Australian stereotypes".
15:18:58 <Pseudonym> They did not, oddly enough, complain about the unrealistic American stereotypes in every other episode.
15:19:15 <kunphuzil> Heh.
15:19:18 <Marvin--> Pseudonym: :)
15:19:26 <kunphuzil> Marvin--: Did they really?
15:19:27 <Marvin--> kunphuzil: in the Simpsons ep, yes, it was very amusing :)
15:19:31 <kunphuzil> Oh, heh.
15:19:39 <Marvin--> LOL, not for real, hahaha
15:25:21 * shapr plays with the spiffy haskell crypto code
15:25:45 <Igloo> Oh?
15:26:08 <shapr> yah, Fractal just donated the libs from http://www.hcsw.org/haskell/ to haskell-libs
15:26:16 <Fractal> :)
15:26:25 <shapr> thanks Fractal :-)
15:26:26 <Fractal> Is there a way to browse CVS via the web?
15:26:28 <shapr> sure
15:26:39 <shapr> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/
15:26:40 <Fractal> Hmm... I can't seem to find the link..
15:26:44 <Fractal> Ah, thanks.
15:26:50 <shapr> I've been distracted by playing with the code, haven't added them yet ;-)
15:27:34 * Igloo should write more stuff
15:27:38 <Fractal> Heh, that's OK... I'm reading lambdabot now. :)
15:28:20 <shapr> lambdabot is neat
15:28:27 <Fractal> Ya...
15:28:46 <shapr> my jedi skillz are not quite up to stack monad transformers though
15:28:49 <Marvin--> shapr: the MAINTAINER file for hws-wp is wrong... I'm not working on my Ph.D., the best I can do is wish that I'll get a Ph.D. student position :P
15:28:50 <shapr> er "stacked"
15:28:56 <shapr> Marvin--: whoops, sorry
15:28:59 <shapr> I'll fix that right away
15:29:25 <kunphuzil> I am doing an example from this tutorial, but it is giving me an error (I am using HUGS):
15:29:28 <kunphuzil> Prelude> shortPalindrome = "ERE"
15:29:31 <kunphuzil> ERROR - Syntax error in input (unexpected `=')
15:29:47 <Marvin--> kunphuzil: let shortPalindrome = "ERE" in ...
15:30:05 <kunphuzil> Oh, ok. The book must use some other interpreter ?
15:30:10 <Igloo> The tutorial might expect you to be putting this in a file and then loading it in hugs
15:30:12 <Pseudonym> Definitions like that need to either be local (using let) or in a script.
15:30:15 <Pseudonym> Right.
15:30:40 <shapr> Marvin--: what do you want MAINTAINER to say?
15:30:56 <kunphuzil> Prelude> let shortPalindrome = "ERE"
15:30:56 <kunphuzil> ERROR - Syntax error in expression (unexpected end of input)
15:30:57 <Marvin--> shapr: doesn't matter at all, as long it's not outright false :)
15:31:05 <shapr> ok
15:31:26 <kunphuzil> Igloo: Yeah.. Maybe.
15:33:52 * Pseudonym has FINALLY managed to derive his own monad transformer using the Hughes method
15:33:55 <Pseudonym> Only took me six months.
15:34:22 <Marvin--> heh
15:34:26 <shapr> I successfully used a monad transformer for the first time today :-)
15:34:26 <Pseudonym> I think the problem was I started without actually understanding it.
15:34:47 <Pseudonym> Also I got some of my axioms wrong.
15:34:50 <shapr> Pseudonym: show us the code!
15:35:53 <inkedmn> Pseudonym: saw the bot you wrote, very nice work :)
15:36:02 <Pseudonym> Thanks.
15:36:13 <Pseudonym> Oh, the code.  Yes, haven't implemented it yet.
15:36:18 <shapr> heh
15:36:21 <Pseudonym> Worked it all out on paper, though/
15:48:28 <shapr> Fractal: ok, your libs are in, thanks again.
15:48:40 <Fractal> Thanks for using them. :)
15:51:15 <Pseudonym> Damn.
15:51:19 <Pseudonym> This is very cool.
15:51:26 <Pseudonym> http://www.flarg.com/parc/
15:51:35 <Pseudonym> REYES-based renderer in 22k lines of C and Python.
15:51:56 <Pseudonym> This is written by the guy who wrote the rendered for PDI/Dreamworks, used in Antz and Shrek.
15:52:29 <Pseudonym> Even includes a GUI toolkit.
15:55:48 <debug> hm
15:56:21 <debug> Pseudonym: yes, I think I saw them
15:56:44 <Pseudonym> http://mds.rmit.edu.au/~ajb/rt.png
15:57:26 <Pseudonym> I think we should extend it to full RenderMan compliance.  What do you think?
15:58:25 <Pseudonym> Oh, I also fixed it so that it does gamma correction before quantisation.
15:58:32 <debug> I think nothing :)
15:58:35 <Pseudonym> It also does dithered quantisation.
15:58:42 <debug> it was just a test to see how few lines I could do it in
15:58:44 <Pseudonym> And stochastic stratified sampling.
15:58:52 * Pseudonym nods
15:58:55 <Pseudonym> Fair enough.
15:59:07 <debug> it resembles something I've coded for ioccc though
15:59:13 <debug> but there was no ioccc last year
16:01:52 * debug has been thinking about data locality (ie data within cache boundaries) w. regards to raytracers
16:07:27 <Pseudonym> Yes.
16:07:33 <Pseudonym> Raytracers and caches are not friendly.
16:07:50 <Pseudonym> This is one reason why most visual effects and animation frames are not ray traced.
16:08:20 <Pseudonym> Because you're shooting samples into a database of geometry, there is no coherency.
16:08:51 <Pseudonym> Scanline renderers are much more coherent, because you have the geometry, you operate on that from start to finish, then you move onto the next piece.
16:08:56 <Pseudonym> Good locality.
16:13:43 <debug> I was thinking more about the function that calculates a hit/miss
16:14:14 <Pseudonym> OK...
16:14:18 <Pseudonym> What did you mean?
16:14:21 <debug> instead of having a linked list of objects, each object having its own location/radius/other info, then why not have a small array with that data and pointers to the actual objects?
16:14:33 <debug> (the small array would be continuous in memory)
16:14:48 <debug> a generic linked list may not be continuous
16:14:54 <shapr> Fractal: I changed all intToWord32 to fromIntegral, added parens around a neg call, added "module Main where" to crc32
16:15:12 <Pseudonym> What you actually want is some kind of spatial partitioning scheme.
16:15:18 <Pseudonym> For large geometry databases.
16:15:30 <Fractal> shapr : OK...
16:15:42 <Pseudonym> That's not a bad idea, though.
16:15:54 <Pseudonym> Oddly enough, we discovered a similar issue in our product the other day.
16:16:06 <Pseudonym> Consider the humble hash table.
16:16:21 <Pseudonym> You have an array of hash chains.
16:16:28 <Pseudonym> Each chain is a linked list of objects.
16:16:37 <Pseudonym> Where the objects have a cached hash value and a "next" pointer.
16:17:04 <Pseudonym> The trouble is that traversing the list usually loads a new cache line for each link in the chain.
16:17:10 * debug is thinking more about hardware caches :)
16:17:16 <Pseudonym> Especially if it's a large hash table.
16:17:26 <debug> yes
16:17:26 <debug> ok
16:17:35 <Pseudonym> What you _really _ want is for each link to be a linked list of smallish arrays.
16:17:45 * shapr wonders if Bernie Pope uses IRC
16:17:47 <Pseudonym> An array of (hash value,object ptr) pairs.
16:17:51 <Pseudonym> Not AFAIK.
16:18:14 <Pseudonym> That way, you only traverse the object pointers if the hash value matches.
16:18:28 <Pseudonym> And in theory, multiple array elements will fit in the same cache line.
16:19:11 <debug> ok
16:19:16 <Pseudonym> You get what I mean?
16:19:20 <debug> I think so
16:19:51 <Pseudonym> I find it amazing, working where I do, that something as simple as a hash table still isn't an exhausted area of research.
16:22:48 <Pseudonym> I'm currently working on sorting, of all things.
16:22:55 <Pseudonym> You wouldn't think that sorting was a hard problem.
16:24:15 <debug> :)
16:25:11 * debug has read something about quadtrees sometimes being faster than binary trees, because in practice the elements of a binary tree are not close to one another so the cache miss penalty is pretty bad
16:25:46 <debug> having 4 subtrees instead of 2 causes the max depth of the tree to be 1/2, which is ok as long as the time spent on each node is less than 2 times as much as in a binary tree
16:26:07 <Pseudonym> Maybe.
16:26:11 <debug> (you need 4 comparisions instead of 2, but you gain some by data locality)
16:26:15 <Pseudonym> I suspect it depends on the data.
16:26:17 <debug> for a simple search
16:26:44 <Pseudonym> It also depends on the application.
16:26:44 <debug> depends on the data, yes
16:26:47 <debug> yes
16:26:54 <debug> this was for filesystem research, I think
16:26:57 <Pseudonym> For example, tries are theoretically superior to hash tables.
16:27:05 <Pseudonym> You only scan the keys once.
16:27:18 <Pseudonym> However, tries are almost impossible to lock for concurrency.
16:27:26 <Pseudonym> Whereas for hash tables, you can put a lock on each chain.
16:28:24 <Pseudonym> My boss is considering writing a book called "Algorithms, Data Structures and Tradeoffs".
16:28:31 <debug> :)
16:28:34 <debug> where do you work?
16:28:56 <Pseudonym> You weren't paying attention earlier, were you?
16:29:14 <Pseudonym> http://www.teratext.com.au/
16:29:45 <debug> I'm usually a bit absent (like in 5-10 channels)
16:30:11 <debug> hm
16:30:12 <debug> ok
16:31:04 * debug should be seen as in "always away"-mode all of the time
16:31:20 * Pseudonym laughs
16:34:57 <shapr> http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/FridgePoetry.jpg
16:35:03 * Pseudonym grows the size of the raytracer by a factor of two again
16:35:06 <shapr> I'm not quite sure what's that for actually...
16:35:12 <debug> :)
16:35:51 <debug> http://193.11.248.54/bigspheres.png
16:35:53 <shapr> http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/SeussFinal2.JPG
16:36:12 <Pseudonym> I just added motion blur.
16:36:35 <Pseudonym> Depth of field is next, I think.
16:36:42 <debug> hm
16:36:55 <debug> bigspheres = forward raytracer, btw
16:37:11 <Pseudonym> Forward raytracer?
16:37:12 <shapr> nice
16:37:23 <Pseudonym> I like the soft shadows.
16:37:24 <shapr> it has a much smoother look to it.
16:37:38 <shapr> than conventional backwards raytracing
16:38:00 <debug> it took... hm... many days to get that far, though
16:38:13 <debug> shapr: yeah, you get antialiasing and stuff like that for free
16:38:20 <debug> but it takes forever
16:38:30 <shapr> we want a Haskell version ;-)
16:38:35 <debug> and this was in preview mode, which is thousands of times faster than an actual trace
16:38:37 <shapr> at least I do :-)
16:38:37 <debug> hehe
16:38:47 <shapr> then I can play around with it myself.
16:38:48 <Pseudonym> I can see the noise.
16:38:49 <debug> it would take even more forever
16:38:57 <debug> Pseudonym: yes, more time == less noice :)
16:38:59 <Pseudonym> What you really want is a two- or three-pass raytracer.
16:39:06 <shapr> or just checkpoints
16:39:11 <debug> I'm not into raytracing.
16:39:13 <shapr> so I can run it like distributed.net
16:39:15 <Pseudonym> I am smart.  I know what you really want.
16:39:32 <debug> shapr: it's already written to be run on many machines (with or without SMP) in a cluster
16:39:37 <shapr> Pseudonym: you wrote an irc bot in Haskell, you've been right so far ;-)
16:39:44 * Pseudonym laughs
16:39:56 <Pseudonym> No, I wrote the start of an IRC bot in Haskell.
16:40:02 <shapr> debug: I have a few machines and an SMP box here
16:40:03 <Pseudonym> You seem to be writing the rest.
16:40:06 <shapr> heh
16:40:22 <shapr> we'll see how many plugins show up
16:41:18 <debug> shapr: still, it's a waste of time to try to get anything nice looking from the forward tracer
16:41:24 <shapr> why?
16:42:00 <debug> in non-preview mode, it is so slow that you'd think that it had stopped  :]
16:42:46 <Pseudonym> You could try implementing the Metropolis algorithm.
16:42:51 <debug> shapr: but if you have _really_ no other use for your cpu cycles, then it might be worth to make a small image
16:43:00 <debug> Pseudonym: what's that?
16:43:02 <shapr> Pseudonym: hope for Superman to save us?
16:43:07 <Pseudonym> Nope.
16:43:08 <debug> hehe
16:43:34 <shapr> forward@home? :-)
16:43:39 <Pseudonym> What you do is you shoot a ray into the scene, from the camera, to an object, to a light source.
16:43:50 * debug remembers a teacher telling him about "naive sorting". "You create a random permutation of your data, check to see if it is sorted. If not, then try again, but if it is sorted, you stop."
16:43:58 * shapr laughs
16:43:59 <Pseudonym> Then you randomly fiddle with the ray.
16:44:02 <shapr> that's pretty naive
16:44:09 <Pseudonym> Hitting multiple objects as you go.
16:44:10 <debug> Pseudonym: "fiddle"
16:44:12 <debug> hehe
16:44:26 <shapr> Pseudonym: I don't understand
16:44:31 <Pseudonym> Uhm...
16:44:31 <Pseudonym> OK.
16:44:42 <Pseudonym> In a ray tracer, you construct a ray from the camera to a light source.
16:44:46 <shapr> right
16:44:52 <Pseudonym> Bouncing off potentially multiple objects.
16:44:54 <shapr> yah
16:45:01 <debug> shapr: there's currently no way to read input files into the tracer, so the scene is random. you need to have the same "random()" behaviour on all your boxes (ie not mix Solaris machines with Linux machines etc)
16:45:04 <Pseudonym> Well, in the metropolis algorithm, you make that explicit.
16:45:13 <Pseudonym> You randomly choose a path.
16:45:50 <Pseudonym> As opposed to classical raytracing, where you shoot a ray into the scene and locally decide what to do with it when you hit an object.
16:46:11 <Pseudonym> You globally choose the path beforehand/
16:46:24 <Pseudonym> It's kinda difficult to describe in words.
16:46:55 <Pseudonym> http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/metro/
16:46:57 <Pseudonym> Pretty pictures.
16:47:17 <unknown_> anyone know why the list that is returned in the following wont print: 
16:47:22 <unknown_> > readLines :: IO [String]
16:47:25 <unknown_> > readLines = do end <- getLine
16:47:27 <unknown_> > rest <- readRest end
16:47:30 <unknown_> > return rest
16:47:32 <unknown_> > readRest :: String-> IO [String]
16:47:35 <unknown_> > readRest end  = do e <- getLine
16:47:37 <unknown_> >     if e == end then return [] 
16:47:40 <unknown_> >else do lines <- readRest end
16:47:42 <unknown_> >return (e:lines) 
16:47:45 <unknown_> I'm a bit boggled
16:47:53 <unknown_> it works, but it just doesn't show the list when I execute it
17:04:31 <debug> gnite shapr
17:04:33 <debug> gnite everyone
17:04:44 * debug goes into debug mode
17:05:01 <shapr> me too
17:05:04 <shapr> sleep time
17:05:12 <debug> Pseudonym: have a nice day
17:05:15 <Pseudonym> Thanks.
17:05:16 <Pseudonym> Night.
17:39:34 <inkedmn> lambdabot: hello
17:39:34 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet.
17:39:37 <inkedmn> heh
17:40:06 <whee> heh
18:30:23 <Pseudonym> lamdabot: @fact inkedmn
18:30:43 <Pseudonym> lamdabot: @fact inkedmn is easily amused
18:30:51 <inkedmn> Pseudonym: :)
18:31:04 <inkedmn> i'm more amused by the fact that there's a haskell bot here than what it can actually do :)
18:31:09 * Pseudonym laughs
18:31:17 <Pseudonym> I was really bored that afternoon.
18:31:28 <inkedmn> it took you one afternoon to write?
18:31:39 <Pseudonym> The first cut, yes.
18:31:52 <Pseudonym> Well, one afternoon plus the few hours here and there absorbing the spec.
18:33:58 * inkedmn hacked out like 15 super-basic functions from his haskell book last night
18:34:01 <Pseudonym> And the ten minutes to install my own IRC server to test it on.
18:34:07 <inkedmn> heh
18:36:06 <inkedmn> would you consider it to be a good "basic networking" example?
18:36:09 <inkedmn> (of haskell)
18:36:13 <Pseudonym> I suppose.
18:36:20 <Pseudonym> The networking is very abstracted.
18:36:28 <Pseudonym> It uses threads, though.
18:36:33 <inkedmn> yeah, noticed that
18:36:45 <Pseudonym> That's how I see a client, though.
18:37:02 <Pseudonym> A thread or two to do the network-specific stuff, then a thread to actually be the client.
18:37:18 <inkedmn> very cool...
18:37:30 <Pseudonym> It's particularly useful in this case because an IRC client is required to respond to a PING as fast as it can.
18:37:41 <inkedmn> yeah
18:37:44 <Pseudonym> So the TCP reader thread does that without bothering the bot/
18:37:47 * inkedmn wrote a couple IRC bots in java
18:37:54 <inkedmn> sweet!
18:38:08 <Pseudonym> The writer thread's only job is handling concurrency.
18:38:18 <Pseudonym> In C++ I would have done that with a mutex.
18:38:30 <Pseudonym> The bot and the reader thread are writing to the pipe concurrently.
18:38:58 <Pseudonym> In Java I would have used thread priorities creatively.
18:39:08 <Pseudonym> Writer thread highest, then reader thread, then the bot itself.
18:39:31 <Pseudonym> That way, PINGs get responded to very quickly.
18:40:16 <inkedmn> yeah
22:26:06 <kyagrd> hello
22:26:26 <kyagrd> I have a question for ghc users in windows ...
22:26:48 <kyagrd> Does Concurrent library work well ?
22:28:00 <kyagrd> Same code, simple echo server with multi user, works very well in BSD but in windows it stucks.
