00:49:01 <pesco> lambdabot: @listcommands
00:49:01 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know that command.
00:49:09 <pesco> lambdabot: @listmodules
00:49:09 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["fact","fortune","hello","state","topic"]
00:51:09 <pesco> lambdabot: @fortune
00:51:09 <lambdabot> Sometimes when I get up in the morning, I feel very peculiar.  I feel
00:51:09 <lambdabot> like I've just got to bite a cat!  I feel like if I don't bite a cat
00:51:09 <lambdabot> before sundown, I'll go crazy!  But then I just take a deep breath and
00:51:09 <lambdabot> forget about it.  That's what is known as real maturity.
00:51:09 <lambdabot> 		-- Snoopy
01:16:31 <Janni> morning!
01:28:13 <Janni> As a code asthaet^Wfetishist I suffer from the fact that I can't decide how to code lists using multiple lines. There is no _real_ nice solution...
01:28:39 <Janni> [
01:28:44 <Janni>     elem 1
01:28:49 <Janni>     ...
01:28:52 <Janni>     elem n
01:28:54 <Janni> ]
01:28:59 <Janni> takes too much space
01:29:30 <Janni> Forgot the commas, by the way...
01:41:43 <Janni> But all the other solution break my otherwise strictly correct/logic indentation
01:42:09 <Janni> Except for "[elem1, ..., elem n]", but I don't like long lines
01:47:14 <mgoetze|away> [ elem1, elem2, elem3
01:47:21 <mgoetze|away>   elem4, elem5, elem6 ]
01:47:28 <mgoetze|away> er, add comma after 3
01:47:41 <mgoetze|away> anyhow, i'm gone
02:02:03 <Janni> yay! I like what I've done "todo :: a; todo = error "fatal error: not implemented"w
02:02:29 * Janni is off for breakfast
02:03:29 <Marvin--> heh
02:21:32 * Janni is back for programming
02:24:21 <ludde> anyone knows how to use haddock? I get warnings about modules not found, eg Maybe, Prelude etc
02:25:49 <Igloo> I don't suppose there are any apache rewrite experts lurking are there?
02:27:08 <ludde> does haskell support something like #define like in C? (yes i know i can use -cpp but haddock doesn't support that)
02:27:39 <Igloo> No
02:29:25 <Janni> ludde: Just for your information: "something like #define like in C" == preprocessor instructions
02:29:34 <ludde> Janni: yeah i know
02:35:47 <ludde> Warning: Main: the following names could not be resolved:
02:35:47 <ludde>     Eq Prelude.[] String IO Handle Prelude.()
02:36:09 <Marvin--> Igloo: I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I'm a user...
02:37:48 <Igloo> Marvin: Any idea why http://chaos.earth.li/~ian/foo/htaccess rewrites http://chaos.earth.li/~ian/foo/foo/ to http://chaos.earth.li/~ian/foo/foo/.shtml.shtml.shtml ad infinitum?
02:39:29 <Marvin--> can't say I do, I haven't used the rewritcond:s a lot :/
02:40:06 <Igloo> Well even just the actual rule should only fire once as it is [L], no?
02:41:36 <Marvin--> point
02:42:20 <kaninchen> hi all
02:43:10 <Igloo> Hmmm, one problem seems to be that %{REQUEST_FILENAME} doesn't get changed when a rewrite happens
02:44:40 <Igloo> Well, I can make it only happen once with "RewriteCond $1 !\.shtml$", which I guess is good enough for now
02:45:22 <o3> Igloo: yeah, the problem is that it'll keep checking through the list of rewrites until none match
02:45:43 <Igloo> o3: But [L] tells it to stop doesn't it?
02:45:54 <Janni> Now there are rabbits running around here. It's neither hares nor someone called "Hase" _not_ meaning hare, but there's a real rabbit now ("kaninchen". ger.)
02:46:28 <kaninchen> Janni hehe
02:46:57 <kaninchen> Janni I used to call me Hase or rabbit beforehand,  but these names where registered .... therefore I chose this one here ...
02:47:00 <Igloo> My problem seems to be that %{REQUEST_FILENAME} loses the trailing / on directories and doesn't reflect the currently rewritten URL as well as [L] not doing what I think it should
02:47:35 <o3> Igloo: you know, i remember trying that and not having it work either
02:47:42 <o3> Igloo: it's been a while, though
02:47:46 <o3> i think i just kludged it, like you did :)
02:48:46 <Marvin--> Igloo: but REQUEST_FILENAME *shouldn't* have the trailing /, it's supposed to be a path in the file system...
02:49:44 <Igloo> Hmmm, maybe
02:50:00 <Igloo> But it doesn't reflect what the web server will look for
02:52:34 <Marvin--> hmm, yeah, dir_module happens before rewrite_module normally
02:52:48 <Marvin--> but that's an internal redirect, isn't it?
02:52:59 <Igloo> The directory doesn't exist
02:53:07 <Marvin--> oh
02:53:14 <Igloo> Neither does the file
02:53:48 <Igloo> But the file is treated as if it were foo.shtml; the directory should give the normal 404
02:54:00 * Igloo spots the internals bit at the top of the mod_rewrite page and reads that
03:06:51 * shapr awakens
03:44:53 <rudy> I have just made a knights tour program in haskell, and it puts all the possible nxm bords on the screen, is it possible to put get what it puts on the screen in a file? (like ~$ cat file > fil2)
03:46:36 <Igloo> ./program > file      or use writeFile "file" rather than putStr     depending on what exactly you mean
03:48:00 <rudy> i'm new to hugs/haskel, I have a .hs file, and I start hugs, and use :load program.hs
03:48:10 <rudy> how do I make an executable of it ?
03:48:52 <Igloo> You can use runhugs - not sure of the details myself, but I'd guess runhugs foo.lhs runs main
03:48:58 <Igloo> Alternatively use GHC or NHC
03:58:16 <rudy> ok thanks, i'll look into that
04:05:43 * Janni is off for lunch
04:19:35 <Janni> and back again...
04:23:36 <Marvin--> quick lunch
04:28:43 <Janni> Yah, only a small one. I had breakfast not too long ago...
04:35:21 * Igloo sits down to write the actual CSE bit of my code and realises it's not going to be as simple as I thought
04:45:28 <Janni> whatis cse
04:46:09 <Igloo> common subexpression elimination
04:54:41 * shapr boings
04:59:08 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact cse Common Subexpression Elimination
04:59:09 <lambdabot> set cse to Common Subexpression Elimination
05:03:11 <Marvin--> lambdabot: @fact recursion recursion
05:03:12 <lambdabot> set recursion to recursion
05:03:33 * Marvin-- whistles innocently
05:06:12 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact recursion
05:06:12 <lambdabot> see recursion, recursion
05:07:22 <Marvin--> d'oh
05:19:59 <andersca_> hi Marvin--, shapr
05:23:20 <shapr> hi andersca
05:51:51 * shapr hacks on lambdabot 
06:09:08 <Vincenz> hiya shapr!
06:09:20 <shapr> hey Vincenz, what's up?
06:09:27 <Vincenz> lambdabot: @fact tail recursion to recursion
06:09:28 <lambdabot> set tail to recursion to recursion
06:09:30 <Vincenz> Not much
06:09:39 <Vincenz> I was stuck on this problem a while back in ocaml
06:09:41 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact tail
06:09:41 <lambdabot> recursion to recursion
06:09:43 <Vincenz> took me a long tim to figure it out
06:09:53 <shapr> Vincenz: see, if you'd been using Haskell ;-)
06:10:02 <Vincenz> hehe
06:10:04 * shapr waves the lambda lifters flag
06:10:10 <Vincenz> parsers in haskell?
06:10:13 <shapr> yes
06:10:16 <shapr> very good ones
06:10:25 <shapr> want some urls?
06:10:35 <Vincenz> sure
06:10:35 <o3> parsec!
06:10:38 <Vincenz> nonono
06:10:42 <Vincenz> I want to learn how to do it on my own
06:10:44 <Vincenz> like I am in ocaml
06:10:46 <Vincenz> I'm writing my own
06:11:21 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/libraries/#scannerParser
06:11:24 <Vincenz> perfect way to learn ocaml while learning how to write my own compiler
06:11:30 <shapr> Parsec is nice
06:11:42 <shapr> so is Happy, Alex, BNFconv
06:11:46 * esap actually learned Haskell while writing a parser combinator library in it.
06:11:48 <o3> any template haskell experts in the hizzy?
06:12:00 <shapr> there's CTK - Compiler ToolKit 
06:12:08 <shapr> and CTKLight for building small compilers in Haskell
06:12:11 <Vincenz> but I want to do it on my own
06:12:35 <shapr> sure, I understand
06:15:47 * esap recommends citeseer for learning about compilers and Haskell :-)
06:15:54 <o3> is it possible for template haskell to call C functions via the FFI inside a splice?
06:15:59 <o3> (somehow, i don't think it is, but hey ...)
06:16:19 <Heffalump> there's no fundamental reason why it wouldn't be
06:16:30 <Heffalump> Igloo might know
06:16:54 <o3> Heffalump: hmm, i think this module is going to get a little crazy if that's possible ...
06:17:21 <Heffalump> hangon, inside a splice, meaning in generated code?
06:17:32 <o3> yeah :)
06:17:39 <Heffalump> oh, I'm sure that's possible, Igloo did it for something
06:17:51 <o3> okay, that's nuts
06:17:59 <o3> good for me, but still nuts
06:18:27 <Heffalump> I think he was trying to clean up some interface code to the curses library
06:18:49 <shapr> Vincenz: here's the RFC822 parser I'm working on: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/email/
06:18:54 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact parsec
06:18:55 <lambdabot> Nothing
06:19:07 <Vincenz> lambdabot: @fact shapr
06:19:08 <lambdabot> Shae Erisson, wrote the factoid plugin for lambdabot
06:19:17 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact parsec http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html
06:19:17 <lambdabot> set parsec to http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html
06:19:20 <Heffalump> there was something on the mailing list about an RFC 2822 parser, wasn't there?
06:19:26 <shapr> recently?
06:19:39 <shapr> I vaguely recall that, don't remember the details though
06:19:48 * shapr searches his local mailing list cach
06:19:49 <shapr> e
06:20:58 <Heffalump> in the last few days
06:21:04 <shapr> oh
06:21:04 <shapr> hm
06:21:16 <shapr> I haven't been reading lately
06:27:30 <shapr> aha
06:36:23 * Marvin-- goes "argh" at galeon-snapshot
06:55:59 <Darius> they aren't kidding about the mkTyCon bit
06:56:04 <shapr> eh?
06:57:00 <Darius> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/base/Data.Dynamic.html
06:57:11 <Marvin--> Darius: what do you mean?
06:58:12 <Marvin--> oh, the "hacky" bit? :)
06:58:36 <Darius> yeah, I was lazy, thought it would be an intermittent then
06:58:42 <Darius> er thing
07:00:30 <Janni> re
07:00:32 <shapr> y0
07:01:36 <kunphuzil> Hehe, I put a small CPU fan on the bottom of my WUSB Adaptor, hasn't overheated since ;)
07:07:02 <Darius> My types are longer than my code...
07:07:14 <shapr> kunphuzil: good idea
07:31:25 <o3> this binding is eeeeeeevil
07:31:33 <shapr> what are you doing?
07:31:43 <o3> objective-c to haskell binding
07:31:47 <shapr> hey o3, you planning on updating runtime_loader to ghc5.04.3 ?
07:32:17 <o3> yeeeeeeah ... *cough*
07:32:27 <o3> i'll do it ... erm, soon? :)
07:32:29 <shapr> heh
07:32:56 <shapr> o3: does that mean I should figure out how to update it myself?
07:33:20 <shapr> when I say soon, it means "sometime before the heat death of the universe"
07:33:32 <o3> within the next few weeks
07:33:38 <shapr> oh, that's excellent
07:34:09 <o3> it is?  you and i definitely use different definitions for 'soon' :)
07:38:25 <Vincenz> shapr: by that definition late is after the Big Crunch...hence too late
07:52:53 <shapr> is there a flip3 ?
07:53:07 <shapr> or is there some simple way to partially apply the third argument to a function?
07:53:33 <shapr> no flip3 in the GHC docs index
07:53:50 <Heffalump> just write it :-)
07:54:01 <shapr> fair enough
07:54:22 <Heffalump> or write a little lambda-expression
07:54:33 <Heffalump> (\x y -> f x y z) where z is the known argument
07:54:44 <shapr> ah
07:54:46 <shapr> cute
07:54:58 <shapr> thanks :-)
07:55:02 <shapr> hi Heffalump, what's up?
07:55:56 <Heffalump> not a lot
07:56:14 <shapr> you still doing a lot of SML?
07:57:03 <Heffalump> yeah
07:57:11 <Heffalump> though doing a bit of work on MAG atm
07:57:14 <shapr> cool
07:57:38 <Igloo> Oh, what are you doing to it?
08:00:48 <Vincenz> (\x y -> y x)
08:00:53 <shapr> that's flip
08:00:58 <Vincenz> that works?
08:01:02 <shapr> sure
08:01:08 <Vincenz> I thought that wuold apply y to x?
08:01:13 <shapr> oh yeah
08:01:14 <shapr> duh
08:01:14 <Vincenz> you can return more than one argument?
08:01:19 * Vincenz still likes
08:01:32 <Vincenz> ((\x -> x x) (\x -> x x))
08:01:53 <Darius> S (I I) (I I)
08:01:55 * shapr 's brain explodes
08:03:04 <Heffalump> igloo: hacking the matching algorithm so it can do decorate, cos I'm fed up of it not being able to
08:03:17 <Heffalump> no idea how I'll write a specification for that, but I don't really care if I get a paper out of it or not :-)
08:03:25 <Igloo> :-)
08:03:36 * shapr discovers the usefulness of addToFM_C 
08:05:39 <Vincenz> what is S (I I) (I I) ???
08:06:05 <shapr> I think it's one of the famous combinators
08:06:07 <Marvin--> Vincenz: S, K and I are the standard lambda calculus combinators
08:06:08 <shapr> Y maybe?
08:06:10 <Darius> (\x.x x) (\x. x x)
08:06:34 <shapr> yah, those guys
08:06:42 <Vincenz> what do S K and I mean?
08:06:48 <Heffalump> I = identity
08:06:51 <Marvin--> K = const
08:06:52 <Vincenz> oh wwait!
08:06:53 <Heffalump> K = konstant
08:06:57 <Vincenz> s..apply argument two to argument 1
08:06:59 <Heffalump> can't remember what S means
08:07:15 <Heffalump> S = (\a b c -> a c (b c))
08:08:03 <Vincenz> why not S I I?
08:10:27 <Heffalump> what about SII?
08:12:29 <Vincenz> fuck
08:12:34 <Vincenz> internet is SLOWWW
08:12:43 <Vincenz> lots of packet loss
08:12:45 <Vincenz> :(
08:13:37 <Janni> I had no proble<message imcomplete due to packet loss!>
08:16:01 * Janni is enjoying very fine ice-cream
08:16:38 <Vincenz> Heffalump: SII does the same as  ((\x -> x x) (\x -> x x))
08:18:51 <Heffalump> SII = \x -> x x
08:19:06 <Heffalump> you want SII(SII) for Y
08:20:45 <Vincenz> no?
08:21:13 <Heffalump> sorry?
08:21:37 <Marvin--> SII == \x.Ix(Ix) == \x.xx
08:22:32 <Darius> that's it
08:22:42 <Marvin--> so yes, you want SII(SII)
08:24:29 <Janni> What's the point with that identity-functions? And who want's to achieve what?
08:24:31 * Janni is confused
08:25:46 <Janni> Forget the first of the two questions.
08:26:46 <Janni> is I used as some kind of curry operator?
08:28:47 <Darius> no, it's just identity, but when all you have is S K I you don't have much choice (actually forget I, I==SKK)
08:29:08 <Darius> S(SKK)(SKK)(S(SKK)(SKK))
08:31:21 <Vincenz> euhm no
08:31:29 <Marvin--> and with X = \t.tKSK you can express S and K in X
08:31:39 <Marvin--> XXX and X(XX) I think, though I don't remember which is which
08:31:40 <Vincenz> I think you're wrong thre
08:31:47 <Vincenz> never mind
08:32:13 <Vincenz> lol
08:32:17 <Vincenz> so basically...
08:32:20 <Vincenz> functional programming is all about porn
08:32:36 <Heffalump> well yes
08:32:37 <shapr> um, what?
08:32:55 <shapr> oh
08:32:56 * shapr laughs
08:33:01 <Vincenz> XXX
08:33:16 <Vincenz> what does K stand for?
08:33:46 <Darius> The constant combinator (I assume that's more or less what it's called, that's what it does)
08:34:01 <Darius> K==const
08:34:48 <Vincenz> SKK = \x.Kx(Kx).....how do apply "constant" to x?
08:34:54 <Darius> Kxy=x so SKKx = x
08:35:22 <Janni> How can you speak of constans in lambda calculus?
08:35:22 <Darius> Ix=x
08:35:22 <Marvin--> Vincenz: just like const in haskell
08:35:22 <Vincenz> Kxy = x???
08:35:22 <Marvin--> Vincenz: yes, K == \xy.x
08:35:22 <Igloo> You can replace K by (\a b -> a)
08:35:22 <Janni> There are no constants in Lambda!
08:35:42 <Darius> and there are no variables in combinatory logic
08:35:51 <Vincenz> why not...Kxy = y?
08:36:31 <Janni> Vincenz: That's by the way the churchian definition of False
08:36:44 <Vincenz> so...
08:36:52 <Vincenz> K = true...
08:36:52 <Janni> It's not a constant
08:37:08 <Vincenz> in church notation
08:37:20 <Janni> Viincenz: but churchian booleans aren't constants. they are functions as well
08:37:32 <Janni> Vincenz: I guess you haven't understood lambda
08:37:36 <Vincenz> and...
08:37:41 <Vincenz> S takes 3 args, K 2, and I 1..?
08:38:00 <Vincenz> what I never figured about the system though is...where do the constants come in? or the additions or the input?
08:38:16 <Heffalump> lambda calculus is a theoretical language, not a practical one
08:38:27 <Janni> Vincenz: they don't exist
08:38:30 <Heffalump> pure lambda calculus has no constants or IO
08:38:59 <Darius> It does have addition... -ish
08:39:19 <Janni> Vincenz: All you can do is to interpret the functions with another calculus
08:39:21 <Heffalump> only if you use Church numerals :-)
08:39:35 <Marvin--> you can encode computations in it though, that's the point of it
08:40:31 <Darius> Yep, all things computable on the natural numbers can be defined with only S K (or choose your favorite combinators)
08:41:39 <Igloo> Why the restriction to the natural numbers?
08:42:25 <Vincenz> yup, you're restricted to POSITIVE numbers
08:42:33 <Vincenz> church doesn't have definitions for negative ones
08:43:24 <Igloo> Can you not make an alternate definition for them though?
08:43:34 <Vincenz> no floating point..
08:43:51 <Igloo> Is lambda calculus not Turing complete?
08:43:54 <Marvin--> yes it is
08:44:03 <Igloo> So the restriction isn't necessary then?
08:44:05 <Marvin--> you can encode Z in N, and you can encode Q in Z
08:44:17 * Vincenz grins and wonders if there's a SKI interpreter written in SKI
08:44:17 <Marvin--> and N in lambda calculus, so...
08:44:30 <Darius> Lookup LazyK
08:45:48 <Darius> (to Vincenz, I'm pretty someone has written a LazyK interpretter in LazyK)
08:46:09 <Darius> er stick a "sure" in there
08:46:28 <Marvin--> "I'm sure pretty"?
08:46:34 * Marvin-- ducks
08:46:34 <Igloo> Written it or sompiled something more real-world to it?  :-)
08:50:21 <Darius> Don't know.
08:50:49 <kaninchen> visit us #lotux ! this is a board game which is not yet popular enough ! I'm very sorry for the amsg :-)
08:51:04 <shapr> is it written in Haskell?
08:51:09 <Igloo> :-)
08:51:32 <Vincenz> Darius: what's LazyK?
08:52:05 <Marvin--> maybe I should apply for a PhD position in Switzerland
08:52:35 <Darius> A esoteric programming language based off of the S K and I combinators
08:52:37 <Darius> http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/cl/lazy-k.html
08:52:38 <Igloo> Marvin?
08:52:55 <Heffalump> expensive place to live
08:53:03 <Heffalump> how's your project going, btw?
08:53:56 <Marvin--> Igloo: mass-mailing of PhD student positions at a Swiss university
08:54:04 <Igloo> Ah
08:54:28 <Vincenz> what topic?
08:54:44 <Marvin--> Heffalump: pretty good, actually, I can actually go all the way from frontend to a backend
08:54:52 <Marvin--> Heffalump: though the input language is kinda limited yet :)
08:55:13 <Heffalump> this is combining theorem proving with quickcheck, OAIC?
08:55:27 <Marvin--> Vincenz: "trusted components", OO, formal methods, programming language semantics et.c.
08:55:40 <Vincenz> ah :)
08:55:41 <Marvin--> Heffalump: not so much combining as replacing with an alternative method
08:55:46 <Heffalump> ah
08:56:11 <Vincenz> I was considering doing a doctorate too, but I haven't gotten the topic refined neough yet
08:56:30 <Marvin--> there are a few interesting questions, such as comparing the speed of quickcheck and this, and comparing how "smart" properties you have to write
08:56:42 <Heffalump> what kind of alternative method?
08:56:59 <Marvin--> well, the alternative method to quickcheck being automatic teorem proving
08:57:15 <Marvin--> but I hope to use the same input language as quickcheck so it's entirely pluggable
08:57:31 * Vincenz sighs at his painstakingly slow internet
08:57:41 <Vincenz> that's what you get when your brother downloads stuff past the monthly limit
08:57:43 * Vincenz mutters
08:57:57 * tmoertel wakes up, courtesy of a cop of hot, fresh coffee
08:57:58 <Marvin--> Vincenz: GET FAST INTERNET NOW!! $$$
08:58:11 * Marvin-- the human spam
08:58:25 <Vincenz> lol
08:59:23 <Vincenz> Marvin--: how old are you?
09:00:11 <Marvin--> Vincenz: 22, why?
09:00:20 <Vincenz> just curious
09:02:19 * Marvin-- goes back to worrying about the net install floppy
09:02:44 <Marvin--> Free space: -35k
09:02:46 <Marvin--> kind of a problem
09:07:03 <Vincenz> hehe
09:07:09 <Vincenz> wheeeeee....whee!
09:08:49 <Vincenz> I expanded my definition to _a-zA-Z(_a-zA-Z0-9)*
09:09:34 <Igloo> Definitions for what?
09:12:12 <Marvin--> identifiers?
09:17:34 * kaninchen is away: I'm busy
09:17:43 <sshaw_> anyone know if there's an alternative name for a "monad"?
09:17:50 * kaninchen is away: watching a movie ! visit http://lotux.homelinux.org/
09:18:12 <Darius> triple
09:27:41 <pesco> Darius: How is a monad a triple?
09:29:40 <Marvin--> pesco: unit, bind and run
09:30:03 <pesco> Marvin: oic
09:30:36 <Marvin--> that's just a guess :)
09:30:46 <Marvin--> but it kind of defines a monad
09:31:07 <pesco> hm
09:53:15 <pesco> shapr: This is an odyssey.
10:20:28 <kunphuzil> If I have function, and it returns a string, how do I make the string it returns another string? (If that makes anysense) For example: I have the function: removeBlanks str = [c | c <- str, c/= ' '] then I do: removeBlanks "Hello I am kunphuzil" It would return "HelloIamkunphuzil" But how would I turn that string into having a variable name?
10:22:28 <OuterMind> kunphuzil: do you mean like asingn the return value of removeBlanks to a variable?
10:22:41 <kunphuzil> OuterMind: yeah
10:22:53 <OuterMind> kunphuzil: you cannot make asignations in haskell
10:23:03 <OuterMind> but you can use local declarations
10:23:16 <OuterMind> which make the same thing
10:23:22 <OuterMind> something like
10:23:29 <kunphuzil> Hmm.. I think I know what you mean
10:23:36 <OuterMind> s=removeBlanks str
10:23:41 <OuterMind> you cannot do than
10:23:44 <OuterMind> that
10:23:46 <kunphuzil> reverse (returnBlanks "Hello, this is a test") 
10:23:47 <OuterMind> but you can do
10:23:50 <OuterMind>  .....
10:23:50 <kunphuzil> something like that? ^^
10:24:00 <OuterMind> where s = removeBlanks str
10:24:13 <OuterMind> do you understand me?
10:24:20 <kunphuzil> Mostly..
10:24:44 <OuterMind> you can use s like if you have done an asignation
10:24:51 <OuterMind> I mean
10:25:06 <OuterMind> myfunc = something s otherthings
10:25:15 <OuterMind>     where s = removeBlanks str
10:25:18 <OuterMind> is like
10:25:28 <OuterMind> myfunk = s=removeBlanks str
10:25:41 <OuterMind>           something s otherthings
10:26:00 <OuterMind> Is that what you wanted to do?
10:26:19 <Gorgar> hello
10:26:32 <kunphuzil> OuterMind: Ok, thanks
10:27:38 <Gorgar> I'm not exactly an haskell newbie, anyway how do you do something like readln(a,b) in haskell?
10:27:46 <OuterMind> you can use let if you want
10:28:00 <Gorgar> that is, read two integers in an  input line
10:28:18 <Gorgar> readLn only reads one per line
10:28:42 <Gorgar> I know I can read the input to a string and parse it...
10:28:56 <Gorgar> but seems to much trouble for such a simple thing...
10:29:01 <OuterMind> myfunc str = let
10:29:01 <OuterMind>       s=removeBlanks str
10:29:01 <OuterMind>         in something s others
10:29:18 <OuterMind> Gorgar: lines
10:29:28 <Gorgar> lol of course
10:29:30 <Gorgar> :)
10:29:31 <OuterMind> Gorgar: lines::String->[String]
10:29:41 <Gorgar> I know the function
10:29:52 <OuterMind> ok :P
10:30:50 <pesco> Gorgar: Huh, how does that solve your problem? I thought you wanted to read something like "1 2" as (1,2), no?
10:31:02 <Gorgar> yeap that works fine, but like I said I still have to parse it
10:31:35 <Gorgar> pesco: well I can read it to a string, then use lines to put each integer in a line then use read
10:32:01 <pesco> No, that's not what lines does.
10:32:10 <Gorgar> but even if I wanna use lines I have to map spaces to \n
10:32:20 <pesco> Oh, you mean that, ok.
10:32:32 <OuterMind> Gorgar: no you haven't
10:32:35 <pesco> Or use words.
10:32:35 <OuterMind> ups
10:32:40 <OuterMind> yeah, you have to
10:32:40 <OuterMind> xD
10:32:43 <Gorgar> I was not very clear, sorry pesco
10:32:49 <Gorgar> OuterMind: I don't?
10:33:07 <OuterMind> Gorgar: yes, you have to map
10:33:25 <pesco> Gorgar: Try words :: String -> [String] which splits at spaces!
10:33:36 <OuterMind> yeah
10:33:52 <Gorgar> yeah, that was the one. I haven't used this functions in ages :)
10:34:00 <Gorgar> ok that is a little better
10:34:27 <Gorgar> read to a string, apply words, then read each line...
10:34:51 <Gorgar> s/line/list...
10:35:02 <Gorgar> whatever... :)
10:36:00 <pesco> Gorgar: Or you can use reads.
10:36:39 <Gorgar> pesco: let me see that one
10:37:16 <Gorgar> ghci could use a :help haskell_standard_function :)
10:41:48 <pesco> Gorgar: let (i1,rest) = head (reads "1 2") in fst (head (reads rest))
10:44:46 <pesco> Or better even: do { (i1,rest) <- reads "1 2"; (i2,_) <- reads rest; return (i1,i2); }
10:46:19 <Gorgar> pesco: I see
10:46:39 <Gorgar> maybe yours it's more efficient but I prefer:
10:46:46 <Gorgar> [a,b]<- readLn >>= mapM readIO.words
10:47:38 <Gorgar> one way or another I still think this is way too much trouble for something so simple
10:51:53 <pesco> Why readIO?!
10:53:14 <Gorgar> to avoid a "return"
10:53:53 <Gorgar> [a,b]<- readLn >>= return.map read.words
10:53:54 <pesco> oic
10:54:11 <Gorgar> don't really know which one looks better
10:54:38 <Gorgar> and I think IO errors are easier to catch...
10:54:53 <Gorgar> not that I really care about that... not now anyway
10:55:37 <Gorgar> anyway, still not happy
10:55:48 <Gorgar> I still prefer: readln(a,b)
10:56:15 <Gorgar> or even scanf("%d %d", &a, &b)
10:58:18 <pesco> Or "twice readInt"?
10:58:28 <Gorgar> readInt?
10:58:36 <pesco> Just hypothetically.
10:58:42 <Gorgar> ah 
10:58:46 <pesco> I don't know how Parsec works.
10:58:46 <Gorgar> that would be nice
10:58:53 <pesco> But I'm pretty sure it has twice.
10:59:05 <pesco> Or rather, I'd be pretty surprised if it didn't.
10:59:10 <Gorgar> never tried parsec...
10:59:37 <pesco> You should. Your earlier statement about parsing being too much trouble is not really valid I think.
10:59:50 <Gorgar> is it included in the std libs?
11:00:01 <pesco> The point is that in whichever way you write it it _is_ parsing, no two ways about it.
11:00:19 <pesco> The question is just how nice your parser is to use...
11:00:38 <pesco> And monadic parser combinators are pretty nice, for all I can see (which is not _too_ much I must admit).
11:00:44 <Gorgar> yes I agree
11:01:04 <pesco> I think Parsec comes with GHC nowadays. Can anyone confirm?
11:01:10 <whee> it does
11:01:27 <Gorgar> oh so I should check ghc docs
11:01:36 <pesco> Have fun!
11:01:38 <Gorgar> no std haskell ones
11:01:42 * pesco smiles
11:01:43 <Gorgar> k :)
11:02:12 <pesco> Yah, I think there is effort underway though, to give the std haskell libs a "real" parser.
11:02:43 <Gorgar> k just found the parsec doc
11:04:47 <Gorgar> bbl
11:30:31 <Janni> re
11:31:24 <kunphuzil> .
11:44:38 <ludde> anyone knows why ghc dies when the other end closes the TCP connection?
11:44:48 <ludde> is it related to the broken pipe signal?
11:48:32 <Janni> It's doesn't show that behaviour in my programs
11:48:55 <ludde> do you run it on unix?
11:49:00 <Janni> yes
11:50:59 <Janni> If you're using Windows and Network.Socket, maybe you forgot withSocketsDo (this might be slightly wrong)
11:51:05 <ludde> no, i'm using unix
11:51:21 <ludde> when the other end disconnects (because of an error), ghci exits
11:52:08 <Janni> Is your program still trying to read from or write to the handle when the connection is down?
11:52:12 <ludde> yeah
11:52:32 <ludde> i've had the same problem with C programs.
11:52:38 <Janni> Ah. I didn't have this case yet...
11:52:54 <ludde> if the connection is closed unsuccessfully, the broken pipe signal is sent
11:54:09 <Janni> Then, I guess, you'll have to use "isOpen" and/or "try" or some stuff like that, but it's only a guess...
11:55:47 <ludde> there's no way to disable the broken pipe signal?
11:56:01 <ludde> in C i would use signal(SIGPIPE, SIGINT) or something like that
12:05:21 <Janni> And what should happen with the functions communicating over a closed handle?
12:10:10 <Janni> hrmpf! Accidentaly hit the power-down-combination when experimenting with keyboard-mapping...
12:21:48 <dennisb> ludde: There is a lot of signal functions in http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/ghc/docs/latest/html/hslibs/process-primitives.html
12:22:48 <dennisb> They may have moved around a bit since that doc was written, but they are probably still there
12:48:32 <ludde> SIGPIPE 
12:48:32 <ludde>  
12:48:32 <ludde> On Unix, when reading from a socket and the writing end is closed by the remote client, the program is normally sent a SIGPIPE signal by the operating system. The default behaviour when a SIGPIPE is received is to terminate the program silently, which can be somewhat confusing if you haven't encountered this before. The solution is to specify that SIGPIPE is to be ignored, using the POSIX library:
12:48:37 <ludde>  
14:12:47 <kaninchen> to all people in the freenode network: visit #lotux if you like board games ... (sry for amsg)
14:14:23 <Marvin--> kaninchen: oh cut that out
14:14:42 <kaninchen> Marvin-- hehe why do I get 2 msgs like that :(
14:14:46 <kaninchen> ok I shut my mouth
14:15:12 <kaninchen> but I just wanted to give a hint :-)
14:15:23 <kaninchen> anyway I stop now
14:26:07 <creature> I don't suppose we've got any electronics experts about, have we? 
14:26:19 <Igloo> I did A level...
14:26:32 <Igloo> (exams taken aged 18)
14:26:57 <creature> Being in the UK, I'm familiar with the A level system. :)
14:27:11 <ludde> a level system?
14:27:19 <creature> I've bollocksed up a digital camera. :/
14:27:24 <Igloo> Oh, not used to that  :-)
14:27:36 <creature> I've taken the back off, and know how it's bollocksed up, but don't know how to fix it. 
14:27:57 <creature> The problem is the buttons on the back don't work any more. 
14:28:01 <Igloo> I suspect I can't help but I'm interested to hear the problem anyway  :-)
14:28:30 <creature> The reason is because there's 3 micro-switches on the inside, that (as far as I can tell) work by having 2 metal plates, one convex, one flat. Looking something like this:   (|
14:28:47 <creature> The button on the back pushes on the convex one, causing it to connect with the flat one, and so a contact is made. 
14:28:57 <Igloo> Right
14:29:12 <creature> However, one of these buttons is no longer convex; it's slightly concave. It's been dented. 
14:29:23 <creature> So it's permanently making a connection.
14:29:52 <creature> I'm guessing the camera's circuitry prevents it registering more than 1 button presses at a time, thus stopping all other contacts worknig.
14:30:14 <creature> So the problem is; how do I undent a microswitch?
14:31:03 <Igloo> That doesn't sound like an electronics question really  :-)
14:31:14 <Igloo> Is this particular button important?
14:31:39 <creature> It's the menu button.
14:31:47 <Igloo> Ah
14:31:51 <creature> Made all the more important by the fact that it's not my camera.
14:32:30 <Igloo> I was going to suggest that things would be improved if it was permanently off rather than permenantly on, but for the menu button that's probably not so good
14:32:50 <creature> Either way, it wouldn't work, which is the important thing.
14:33:00 <Igloo> The other buttons would work, though
14:33:16 <Igloo> I'd just try prodding it as best I could with something small I think
14:34:42 <creature> I think I'm going to have to 'fess up to this one. :/
14:35:35 <Igloo> Sounds wise
14:36:37 <creature> It's going to be pricey to rectify. :<
14:37:12 <creature> The "prodding it with something small" method would be a good plan if it was just stuck, but it's actually deformed. 
14:37:24 <creature> As in, now sits like )| in its natural state. 
14:38:46 <Igloo> It might spring back if you're lucky, but if it was me I wouldn't prod further for fear of doing more damage given the situation
14:39:01 <creature> I poked it gently with a cotton bud, didn't work.
14:39:10 <shapr> I'm the sort who prods until it works or I have to buy a new one.
14:39:55 <Igloo> But if it wasn't yours, shapr?
14:39:56 <creature> I've got a friend of a friend who owns a surface-mount factory; I could always go down that route before taking the honest approach.
14:40:17 <shapr> Igloo: yes, even it wasn't mine. I often fix things for my friends.
14:40:27 <shapr> dishwashers, cars, cameras, computers, etc
14:40:35 <Igloo> And without the owner knowing?  :-)
14:40:41 <shapr> yes, that too sometimes.
14:40:51 <Igloo> Fair enough  :-)
14:41:21 * Igloo makes a note to take my broken TV when I get to meet shapr. Or maybe not as it would involve airplanes etc  :-)
14:41:34 <shapr> I spent a New Year's weekend at a friend of a friend's once, and his mac IIci was broken
14:42:01 <shapr> we were supposed to pay rent to the guy to stay the weekend
14:42:13 <shapr> but I got bored in the first fifteen minutes of being there, so I fixed the mac
14:42:18 <shapr> because I wanted to use it.
14:42:23 <Igloo> :-)
14:42:42 <shapr> I hadn't met the guy yet, but he was very happy when he arrived, and let us stay for free and gave us lots of vodka
14:42:55 <creature> What was wrong with the mac? 
14:43:14 <shapr> one of the nubus slots was totally fried, the one the display card was in
14:43:24 <shapr> so I swapped it into one of the other slots and it worked.
14:43:31 <shapr> thirty seconds of effort
14:43:33 <creature> Cool.
14:43:42 <creature> Any bright ideas about this switch?
14:43:46 <shapr> he took it to a professional computer repairguy and they said they couldn't fix it.
14:43:53 <shapr> creature: I'd have to see it :-/
14:44:23 <creature> I think the back of the digital camera is about the only thing in the room I couldn't take a picture of. :/
14:44:28 * shapr laughs
14:44:33 <Marvin--> hahaha
14:44:39 <Marvin--> creature: try mirrors :-)
14:44:46 <shapr> yah, I was about to say that.
14:44:55 <shapr> I'd love to quote that, but I think the explanation is too long
14:45:23 <creature> I only have one, and besides there's the whole problem of the camera flash.
14:45:47 <Marvin--> dad took a really great photo when I was just born, a photo of mom and I, but the opposite wall at the hospital was a mirror wall, so he's on the picture too :-)
14:45:53 * shapr grins
14:47:15 <Marvin--> hrrrm, I've been toying with the idea of creating a monk character for our next D&D campaign... but tell me... the DM has given us 2700 gp to spend on equipment... what the heck does a monk do with that kind of money!?
14:47:39 <shapr> Marvin--: bribe the other party members
14:47:52 <shapr> or spend it on training
14:47:54 <creature> I could advise, but only from a Nethack frame of reference.
14:48:08 <shapr> Marvin--: buy a really nice horse?
14:48:09 <Marvin--> shapr: er, afaik that's not how it works
14:48:11 <Aether> hmm
14:48:21 <Marvin--> shapr: when I'm sworn to poverty?
14:48:24 <Aether> Marvin--: how old are you ?
14:48:32 <Marvin--> why do everybody keep asking me that?
14:48:38 <shapr> Marvin--: cause we can never remember
14:48:40 <Marvin--> heck, no lambdabot here too
14:48:45 <shapr> oh, I'll fix that

14:49:51 <shapr> Aether: psst
14:50:17 <Marvin--> nah, I think I'll go with my former-bodyguard-now-lousy-sellsword idea after all, you can get some really nice weaponry and armor for 2700gp
14:50:19 <Aether> huh ?
14:50:33 <shapr> Aether: now you have to fill in your info
14:50:40 <Marvin--> shapr: a heavy warhorse is 400 gp, and they're awesome :-)
14:50:44 <shapr> yah, exactly
14:50:55 <shapr> and a horse is not money
14:51:01 <Aether> lambdabot: @fact Marvin--
14:51:01 <lambdabot> Martin Sjögren, 22 years old, dammit
14:51:08 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact Aether
14:51:09 <lambdabot> Nothing
14:51:10 <shapr> hmm
14:51:19 <Aether> how do i specify info ?
14:51:28 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact Aether some guy on #haskell
14:51:29 <lambdabot> set Aether to some guy on #haskell
14:51:32 <Marvin--> I can't really picture a monk sworn to poverty with an expensive horse and fancy gear though
14:51:36 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact delete Aether
14:51:36 <lambdabot> deleted Aether
14:51:44 <Marvin--> Oh my god, you deleted Aether!
14:51:48 <Marvin--> You bastard!
14:51:50 <shapr> Marvin--: he's your friend, you grew up with the horse
14:51:53 * shapr cackles evilly
14:51:58 <Marvin--> shapr: a heavy warhorse? get real
14:52:02 <shapr> I know ;-)
14:52:22 <Aether> lambdabot: @fact Aether Jason Mobarak, 19 years old, go python
14:52:22 <lambdabot> set Aether to Jason Mobarak, 19 years old, go python
14:52:29 <shapr> yay!
14:52:33 <Marvin--> python, THE ENEMY!
14:52:37 <Marvin--> no wait, that was C++
14:52:38 <shapr> nice to meetcha Jason
14:52:42 <shapr> Marvin--: right, C++ is the enemy
14:52:44 <shapr> or Java maybe
14:52:48 <Aether> Java
14:52:52 <Marvin--> C++ is eviller than C++
14:52:56 <shapr> Java suxx0rs
14:52:56 <Marvin--> er, than Java
14:52:57 <Aether> definately java
14:52:59 <Marvin--> sorry for the recursion
14:53:08 <creature> I don't reckon Java's that bad, to be honest. 
14:53:15 <shapr> creature: have you actually *used* Java?
14:53:27 <Marvin--> java sure beats C++ by several horse-lengths
14:53:28 <Aether> but everyone enjoys ragging on java
14:53:45 <shapr> once I found Python, I didn't understand why anyone used Java
14:53:58 <shapr> now that I've found Haskell, I *really* don't understand why anyone uses Java
14:54:02 <Marvin--> shapr: because it's a commercial product with lots of fancy acronyms like J2EE and XML
14:54:11 <Marvin--> marketing marketing marketing
14:54:14 <shapr> hey, we have MPTC, and STG, and...
14:54:21 <lament> heh
14:54:22 <lament> .
14:54:24 <shapr> ,
14:54:25 <creature> shapr - I've been learning Java for the past 6-7 months. 
14:54:31 <creature> The joys of a CS degree. 
14:54:31 <Marvin--> after all, python's *interpreted* man, that's gotta be slow and unsafe
14:54:36 <creature> And as I say, I don't think it's that bad.
14:54:37 <lament> Marvin--: oh no!!!
14:54:43 <Marvin--> creature: we start with Haskell .-)
14:54:52 <shapr> creature: that's funny, I learned Java when it was in beta.  I got paid to write Java the first time one month after java 1.0.2 was released.
14:54:58 <lament> creature: just one of the billion reasons why i'm not going to do CS
14:55:03 <Aether> creature: same here
14:55:03 <shapr> and in my well-informed opinion
14:55:05 <shapr> JAVA SUCKS
14:55:18 <Marvin--> shapr: ever tried C++?
14:55:22 <shapr> thank god, no
14:55:28 <Marvin--> good for you
14:55:31 <shapr> I've done some C
14:55:32 <lament> heh
14:55:44 <lament> people actually argue that quite often
14:55:45 <Marvin--> C's excellent for some things
14:55:48 <creature> Marvin-- - we get Haskell and Java in the first year. 
14:55:49 <Aether> shapr: ever tried mercury ?
14:55:49 <lament> "foo rules, because it's better than bar"
14:55:52 * psy slaps Marvin-- for his silly python comments :)
14:55:54 <shapr> it's also verbose, but not in the mind-numbingly required way that Java is verbose.
14:55:54 <creature> C/C++ and occam in the second. 
14:55:54 <Marvin--> like speed and size of executable
14:55:57 <lament> who cares if java is better than c++
14:56:00 <shapr> Aether: nope, haven't tried mercury.
14:56:02 <lament> both are shit
14:56:18 <Marvin--> psy: uh, I was being sarcastic, I'm a python fan myself
14:56:28 <Marvin--> psy: I've worked for Strakt if you know about them
14:56:29 <psy> Marvin--: oh...doh, i knew that, too
14:56:32 <shapr> yah, I like Python too.
14:56:35 <lament> heh
14:56:41 * lament quickly renames the channel to #python2
14:56:45 <shapr> but I prefer Haskell over python.
14:56:49 <Marvin--> me too
14:56:54 * Marvin-- renames lament to lament++

14:57:34 <shapr> er, dangit
14:57:46 <creature> How would you convert a unix text file to a dos text file? 
14:57:47 <shapr> lament: it's still not a legal Haskell list.
14:57:53 <shapr> creature: install dos?
14:58:00 <Marvin--> creature: vim :)
14:58:05 <psy> creature: don't do that, just convert all your dos text files to unix and use a real editor :)
14:58:08 <shapr> actually, I'd use the flip executable
14:58:12 <lament> shapr: but a legal list won't fit!
14:58:27 <shapr> lament: be creative
14:58:32 <creature> Marvin-- - how in vim?

14:58:46 <creature> psy - I'm not using it, but I was asked by a friend and would like to appear knowledgeable. :)
14:58:49 <Marvin--> creature: set fileformat=
14:59:03 <creature> set fileformat=dos ? 
14:59:08 <Marvin--> yes
14:59:12 <Marvin--> or set fileformat=unix
14:59:16 <lament> shapr: there.
14:59:21 <creature> Marvin-- - cheers.
15:00:05 <shapr> lament: heh
15:00:09 <shapr> good enough
15:02:50 <Marvin--> one hour left of the elections
15:03:04 <Marvin--> the suspense is unbelievable
15:49:11 <shapr> Marvin--: well, tell us the outcome
15:49:44 <creature> Heh.
15:51:40 <Marvin--> shapr: it'll probably be all over dda
15:51:56 <shapr> dda?
15:52:02 <Marvin--> debian-devel-announce
15:52:05 <shapr> oh
15:52:08 <shapr> I'm not on that list
15:59:06 <creature> Anyone ever played Chinese Patience? 
15:59:26 <shapr> never heard of it
16:00:11 <creature> Shame. I'm trying to find a copy of the rules online. 
16:00:16 <creature> pagat.com doesn't seem to have it.
16:01:38 <lament> if it's not on pagat, it's not real!
16:04:14 <creature> Heh. That's why I'm trying to find alternative names.
16:20:12 <Marvin--> tbm won
16:20:24 <Marvin--> http://vote.debian.org/2003/vote_0001
16:22:05 <Marvin--> very very close though
16:23:42 <shapr> I don't understand the statistics
16:24:38 <shapr> in any case, yay!
16:24:39 <Marvin--> in the condorcet method every voter ranks the candidates
16:24:54 <Marvin--> what do you mean yay, I voted for OF ;)
16:25:45 <shapr> well, debian has a leader
16:25:47 <shapr> that's good.
16:26:00 <Marvin--> well, yes
16:26:43 <shapr> oooh, debian funding as part of the EU's 6th framework
16:27:45 <shapr> is there an SPI/FSF org for sweden?
16:27:55 <shapr> something that funds OSS setups who need cash?
16:28:03 <Marvin--> no idea
16:28:32 <Marvin--> Strakt donated money to EFF instead of buying silly christmas gifts for the staff, nice gesture IMO
16:28:47 <shapr> I'm very interested in hooking up with codefactory and others to get OSS into schools.
16:28:58 <shapr> the best SFI software is dos only
16:29:08 <shapr> the crappiest is built using Java Swing
16:29:14 <shapr> looks pretty, works for shit
16:31:05 <shapr> I could do a better hack over the weekend with HTk
16:39:49 <Marvin--> impressive of moshez to manage to step on more toes than OF
16:39:54 <shapr> heh
16:39:56 <shapr> well
16:40:08 <shapr> he's a cool guy, but he can be abrasive at times.
16:41:26 <Marvin--> wonder if OF will run next year too :P
16:42:14 <Marvin--> really really close result... bdale lost by 4 votes
16:42:59 <Marvin--> and OF by 28 or something
16:43:35 <Marvin--> I think OF had the most 1:s, but with condorcet he lost
16:44:53 * creature wonders if the guy upstairs is having sex, or if it's just an irregular bassline to his music.
17:40:49 <shapr> hi o3
17:41:03 <o3> morning
17:43:44 * shapr slowly refactors lambdabot
17:44:29 <shapr> is there some cute and cheesy way I can get a random Int seed to put into a System.Random prng?
18:22:06 * shapr boings
18:22:10 <shapr> hi flippo, wassup?
18:24:56 <flippo> shapr: not much.  Talking politics in #world-relations
18:25:02 <shapr> oh
18:38:26 <flippo> shapr: I should stop.  :)  It's a complete waste of time.
18:39:01 <flippo> shapr: strangely everyone in the channel seems to be pro-war.  I never meet these people in real life.
18:44:32 <shapr> when it comes to political discussions, I go off to code.
18:44:56 <shapr> I need some help with this Haddock stuff
19:23:44 <kunphuzil> How would I create the char ' ? Using ''' does not work.
19:24:22 <shapr> try '\''
19:27:15 <kunphuzil> ok
19:28:17 <kunphuzil> works, thanks
19:31:04 <kunphuzil> Cool, I have created an almost complete Paldrome program. Only thing that doesn't work is if you have capital or small.
19:35:54 <shapr> you could turn all the capital letters into small letters in the input
19:37:42 <kunphuzil> How?
19:38:06 <shapr> how would you do it in other languages?
19:38:38 <shapr> I'd suggest writing a function that can turn one capital letter into one small letter
19:38:42 <shapr> and then mapping that over the input
19:38:57 <kunphuzil> Yeah.. I am not sure how I'd go about that yet though, still learning..
19:38:58 <whee> reinventing the wheel, are we? :D
19:39:03 <shapr> whee: hey, he's learning Haskell
19:39:11 <kunphuzil> doesn't haskell have a function for this?
19:39:26 <shapr> kunphuzil: I'd suggest import Char and using ord and chr
19:39:35 <shapr> that way you can find the offset of capital and small letters
19:39:51 <shapr> I'm off to sleep
19:39:54 <kunphuzil> ok
19:40:02 <kunphuzil> don't get it.. I'll just keep on with my tutorial. 
19:40:23 <kunphuzil> (The above isn't even part of it, I was just having fun)
