04:20:59 <shapr> yow, good morning!
04:32:11 <liiwi> yo
04:32:15 <shapr> wassup?
04:35:45 <liiwi> hangover
04:35:48 <shapr> ow
06:33:29 <shapr> hi buggs 
06:33:31 <shapr> wassup?
06:33:38 <buggs> hoi shapr
06:33:59 <buggs> have you seen the irc ghci yesterday?
06:34:26 <shapr> I saw it in the scroll back
06:34:34 <shapr> is your rubby online somewhere download?
06:35:06 <opet> irc ghci?
06:35:35 <buggs> well rbot is online, but not my module
06:35:39 <shapr> yah, whee and buggs both wrote a ghci to irc chunk yesterday
06:35:50 <shapr> whee used erlang, and buggs used ruby
06:35:55 <buggs> the module does a lot of cool stuff, but it's very insecure :/
06:36:05 <shapr> buggs: then it can be cleaned up
06:36:11 <opet> that's cool :)
06:36:14 <shapr> good enough is best :-)
06:36:17 <shapr> yah, it's very cool
06:36:27 <shapr> I've had that dream of irc accessible interpreters for a long time
06:36:44 <buggs> well if anyone knows how to call ghci in a safe way maybe
06:37:03 <opet> stick it into a jail?
06:37:30 <shapr> buggs: if you put your code online, we'll figure out something
06:39:12 <buggs> well opet ppl will not run it in jail and i tend not to releas such insecure code
06:39:26 <buggs> i can send it to you via mail shapr
06:39:29 <shapr> yes please!
06:39:36 <shapr> shae at ScannedInAvian dot com
06:40:02 <opet> buggs: yeah.. fair enough
06:51:37 <buggs> sent, but anyways the magic is rbot, http://linuxbrit.co.uk/rbot/, by using it it's trivial to implement
06:52:17 <shapr> thanks for the references
06:53:58 <shapr> now I want to learn Erlang and Ruby after Haskell
06:54:46 <mgoetze> shapr: you already know scheme?
06:55:30 <shapr> not really, I've read about half of SICP, but I've never written anything real in Scheme
06:56:11 <mgoetze> learn scheme instead, then :)
06:56:17 * mgoetze is sure that Riastradh would agree.
06:56:53 <shapr> I'm more interested in learning new paradigms
06:57:03 <shapr> logic constraint programming is next on my list
06:57:16 <shapr> I got into Haskell for the 'purest' FP
06:57:40 <mgoetze> shapr: scheme is great for jumping around between paradigms :)
06:58:09 <shapr> yah, I've seen that from SICP
06:58:18 <shapr> scheme is very flexible
06:58:33 <shapr> but I want to learn languages that encourage, or nearly require a certain viewpoint
06:59:03 <mgoetze> or even violently require? lol
06:59:45 <shapr> yes, maybe so :-)
07:00:00 <shapr> if you try to write procedural code in Haskell, you just don't get anywhere
07:01:43 <buggs> i'd prefer lisp to scheme
07:01:51 <shapr> common lisp?
07:02:03 <shapr> I do a lot of elisp, but more by accident than anything else
07:03:27 <shapr> it all seems like lisp to me :-)
07:04:22 <mgoetze> buggs: what's better about lisp than scheme?
07:05:39 <buggs> implementations and more of lisp
07:06:04 <mgoetze> well, i did have to look a while before i found a scheme implementation to my liking :)
07:07:51 <buggs> which one you use?
07:08:25 <mgoetze> guile
07:13:14 <buggs> hmm thought ppl only use as embedded interpreter
07:13:29 <buggs> didn't know they do worthwhile stuff with it
07:34:11 <Janni> salvete amicae amicique
07:42:18 <buggs> hoi Janni
07:44:45 <mgoetze> moin Janni 
08:33:52 <andersca> I want my mtv!
08:33:55 <andersca> (where mtv == ipod)
08:34:02 <hdaume> hi all
08:50:57 <buggs> shapr, any ideas about sandboxing ghci?
08:54:30 <ludde> isn't it safe if you ban IO?
08:55:01 <Igloo> You can still be DoSed or DoS the channel
08:55:22 <ludde> but then a sandbox won't help, will it?
08:55:38 <Igloo> Depends exactly what you mean by a sandbox
09:00:49 <buggs> i don't care about dos
09:02:29 <shapr> buggs: a) user mode linux b) run it as a user with very little priveleges and a very small home dir quote, maybe even on a ramdisk /home/ghci
09:02:56 <buggs> in ruby you can set $SAFE to a value from 0 to 4m but that blows on irb (sth like ghci)
09:03:14 <shapr> buggs: ask on ghc-users, you'll probably get the best answers there
09:03:56 <buggs> is ghc-users accesible via nntp ?
09:04:37 <shapr> I don't think you can post to it via nntp
09:12:13 <whee> shapr: look at my crappy code? heh
09:12:54 <whee> mine has an odd buffering problem on output, but it's fixable in a few lines of code (that I'm too lazy to write :)
09:20:32 <whee> that irc bot of mine gets a rewrite after I start/finish this other project of mine; I'll do whatever you want with it then shapr :p
09:28:22 <hdaume> wasn't someone in here writing a hs lib that would allow you to read z-compressed files?  Igloo?
09:36:52 <Igloo> I have inflate for RFC1951
09:37:10 <Igloo> Which is what is used by gzip if that's what you want
09:37:38 <Igloo> Should be in http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/HazGuard/HazGuard-0.1.0.tar.gz
09:42:20 <hdaume> Igloo: what are the two values returned by inflate?
09:43:38 <Igloo> The result and the remaining bits
09:43:59 <Igloo> Which in the case of gpg should probably be at most 7 zeroes
09:45:00 <Igloo> It's not likely to win any performance awards, incidentally
09:45:12 <hdaume> Igloo: okay cool
09:45:13 <Igloo> Although I hope it is now linear space
09:45:21 <hdaume> Igloo: always a plus :)
09:45:48 <Igloo> :-)
09:46:39 <bubba1034> My stupid question for today.
09:47:02 <bubba1034> Is there an interactive ghci mode for emacs. If so how do I start it?
09:47:34 <mgoetze> bubba1034: let's hope there isn't! :)
09:47:41 <Smerdyakov> Let's hope there ____!
09:48:14 <buggs> i buy an "i"
09:51:04 <shapr> bubba1034: M-x turn-on-haskell-hugs or turn-on-haskell-ghci, then C-h m in a Haskell mode buffer.
09:55:24 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, do you go by the name Bubba in Real Life?
09:57:10 <bubba1034> Not really but sort of in a way.
09:57:13 <Marvin--> "Lightningspeed context sensitive program analysis" wow, interesting
09:57:51 <bubba1034> It started at a job where a manager took me away from programming the general system
09:58:04 <bubba1034> to maintaining some math libs.
09:58:35 <bubba1034> Because he had notions of "mathematical" programmers being a higher life.
09:58:47 <Smerdyakov> It is!
09:58:56 <bubba1034> This after just coming from a job where programmers were considered a lower life.
10:00:30 <bubba1034> In that job the mathematical programmers were telling the system programmers ( by system I mean the system in question not an OS )
10:01:09 <bubba1034> that the architecture would be to slow, and the system programmers telling the math staff that they
10:01:31 <bubba1034> didn't understand programming and were just math programmers.
10:03:20 <bubba1034> The manager that thought math prog were a higher level of life shouldn't go near a computer.
10:03:56 <bubba1034> By "math prog" he meant someone designing algorithms and never touching code.
10:04:27 <bubba1034> He used to work for AT&T. If you ever work for telecom, you will no what I mean.
10:05:27 <bubba1034> s/no/know/
10:06:03 <bubba1034> IN telecom God forbid you an architect, designer or any other system person write a single
10:06:09 <bubba1034> line of code.
10:06:33 <buggs> well they need many 9s
10:13:35 <bubba1034> Some guy on the radio was refering to Clinton as "bubbadoc" ( the US just invaded Haiti )
10:13:48 <bubba1034> I was called doc at that time.
10:14:36 <bubba1034> I heard the "bubbadoc" reference with a friend and said "Hey that's me".
10:14:54 <bubba1034> So he started to call me bubbadoc, and it got abbreviated to bubba.
10:15:14 <bubba1034> SO how do I exit ghci?
10:15:26 <bubba1034> Never mind.
10:25:06 <bubba1034> Time to go. Thanks.
10:52:17 <hdaume> http://board.crewcial.org/t.php?id=16330&r=57 hilarious
10:56:29 <Marvin--> hahaha
10:56:42 * shapr laughs 
10:58:44 <Marvin--> "Just don't ever go to Texas. EVER."
10:58:45 <Marvin--> hahaha
10:59:07 * shapr continues laughing
10:59:22 <Marvin--> "loot these items first before wal-mart runs out"
11:00:15 <Marvin--> "If debris begins falling, proceed to give yourself a blowjob."
11:00:50 <shapr> "Walk blindly into a midget's home"
11:00:51 <Marvin--> "Walk blindly into a midget's home." rofl
11:02:10 <Marvin--> "avoid natural light as it will make you dark"
11:02:30 <Marvin--> "Consider moving to one of the solar system's outer planets" lol
11:02:51 <shapr> "In the event of an emergency your filing cabinets will become intimidating. Do not file or organize for they are tall and angry"
11:04:01 <Marvin--> hihi
11:04:39 <Marvin--> "The further you are from the blast the longer you will suffer before you die."
11:04:48 <Marvin--> " beware of the dreaded Tetris Attack" ROFL
11:05:52 <hdaume> i love the tetris one : )
11:06:57 <shapr> I like the stories created from sequences of these signs
11:07:16 <shapr> some of these captions really deserve t-shirts
11:07:55 <Marvin--> oh yes :)
11:08:22 <Marvin--> "thank you but, our princess is in another castle."
11:08:24 <Marvin--> omg! rofl!'
11:08:38 <Marvin--> "this may be your last chance to see The Phantom of the Opera." hahaha
11:08:39 <shapr> "After absorbing large quantities of radiation, watch how your hand goes through steel doors"
11:09:09 <hdaume> truly the funniest thing i've seen in a LONG time
11:09:30 <shapr> I agree
11:10:17 <Marvin--> "If you see a terrorist arrow, pin it against a wall with your shoulder."
11:12:22 * shapr must breathe!
11:13:02 <Marvin--> "People choke on fishbones every day. Fish are Terrorists."
11:13:25 <shapr> "Eventually your housemates will so loathe your internet habit that they will hurl pointy shards of glass at you!"
11:14:46 <shapr> http://www.cafeshops.com/notreadygov
11:14:47 <shapr> cool
11:15:46 <shapr> oh, I got an improved .sig from Volker Stolz
11:15:57 <shapr> mapM_ putStrLn $ fix ("hello":)
11:16:10 <Marvin--> heh
11:16:31 <Marvin--> not that fix is in the prelude, is it?
11:16:51 <shapr> I don't know
11:16:55 <Marvin--> hahaha, they already *are* on t-shirts
11:16:59 <shapr> I'm not even sure what fix does
11:17:00 <Igloo> Don't you mean ++?
11:17:08 <Marvin--> Igloo: no, mapM_
11:17:17 <Igloo> Instead of :
11:17:19 <Marvin--> I think unlines is cuter though
11:17:33 <Marvin--> with ++ you'd get just one letter per line
11:20:05 * Igloo bops himself on the head
11:21:05 <Marvin--> shapr: but yes, Y ("hello":) is kinda cute
11:21:21 <dennisb> fix x = x (fix x)
11:21:32 <shapr> oh
11:21:34 <shapr> hi dennisb 
11:21:41 <dennisb> heeeeeello
11:21:45 <shapr> wasssup?
11:22:04 <dennisb> i'm just waiting for the next frasier episode on tv
11:22:15 <dennisb> 8 minutes to kill
11:23:23 <shapr> yay
11:23:25 <shapr> TV
11:24:04 <dennisb> TV! The best thing since sliced bread. Or what it is you americans say
11:24:38 <Marvin--> "warning: swallowing anti-terrorist whistle may cause baldness and cartoon-like whistling when you speak."
11:26:49 <shapr> man, this paper that fix came from is very spiffy
11:27:01 <dennisb> fix came from?
11:27:26 <shapr> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html
11:27:29 <dennisb> fix is old stuff
11:27:38 <shapr> the paper is from 1995
11:28:07 <Marvin--> uh
11:28:14 <Marvin--> fix-point combinators come from lambda calculus
11:28:44 <hdaume> does anyone have/know of a hs impl of string edit distance (K-divergence)?
11:29:30 <shapr> is that related to the DCG stuff Pseudonym was talking about?
11:29:37 <Marvin--> \g.\x.g(xx)\x.g(xx) is a fix-point combinator for example
11:29:40 <hdaume> DCG?
11:29:56 <dennisb> yes, Church and others around 1930
11:30:13 <shapr> hdaume: buggs and Pseudonym were talking about it last night
11:30:38 <hdaume> i mist have missed it : )
11:30:45 * shapr looks for it in the logs
11:31:48 <hdaume> ah no, different
11:32:15 <shapr> oh, ok
11:32:15 <hdaume> i think i found an impl though
11:32:44 <shapr> DCG = definite clause grammar
11:32:48 <shapr> just found it in the logs
11:33:32 <buggs> hdaume, sth like levensthein aldorithm?
11:33:38 <hdaume> yeah
11:34:31 <buggs> have one in java not haskell
11:34:41 <hdaume> i got one in haskell from lloyd
11:34:50 <shapr> lloyd?
11:35:01 <hdaume> allison.  csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd
11:36:03 <Marvin--> "terrific, I'm the broccoli of dating" heh
11:36:36 <shapr> ah, requires www
11:36:41 <shapr> http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/
11:36:42 <hdaume> yeah
11:37:09 <shapr> oh the animated towers of hanoi is spiffy!
11:38:59 <palomer> :o
11:40:52 <palomer> lol, that's the best animation ever
11:42:15 <palomer> Text book: M. A. Weiss. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C.
11:42:18 <palomer> ew.
11:43:26 <shapr> neat, he talks about suffix trees
11:44:11 <shapr> he doesn't mention multidimensional suffix trees though.
11:44:57 <shapr> his javascript stuff is *spiff*
11:44:58 <shapr> y
12:16:44 <shapr> hey esap, have you read the Mark Jones paper where he defines Dual as a datatype?
12:17:05 <esap> shapr: which paper?
12:17:26 <esap> shapr: I think I
12:17:33 <shapr> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html
12:19:12 <esap> shapr: I think I have read this. At least it sounds very familiar subject, might be some time though.
12:22:02 <esap> shapr: One of the things is that I think 'dual' should not have type 'a -> a'.
12:22:52 <esap> shapr: at least that choice will restrict the definition of duality to those where the dual is found from the same category.
12:40:06 <shapr> esap: good point
12:48:45 <Janni> re
12:49:25 <Marvin--> heh, Koen's insane
12:50:25 <Marvin--> he wants me to pick a backend to work on for my master project implementation, and pick it soon, so he can start hacking on another himself :P
12:55:38 <shapr> which one do you prefer so far?
12:56:06 <Marvin--> I don't know
12:56:39 <Marvin--> I'm intrigued by both converting to a theorem prover format -and- writing my own search heuristics
12:56:44 <Marvin--> both probably have merits
12:56:52 <Marvin--> fiddling with prolog is a possible backend too
12:57:20 <Smerdyakov> Please don't fiddle with my backend, OK?
12:57:38 * Marvin-- happily fondles Smerdyakov's backends
12:58:24 <Marvin--> oh sorry, I thought you were in refutational/negated mode like me
12:58:35 * Marvin-- ducks
12:59:01 <Smerdyakov> That would be "... like I"
12:59:20 <Marvin--> whatever
12:59:30 <Marvin--> I din't do nuthing!
12:59:45 <Marvin--> .oO("Objection! The defendant is using double negations!")
13:56:04 <bubba1034> HYow can I define a Type as a function that takes a and makes b ( a-> b ) and declare an arguement in a HOF as being that type?
13:57:58 <Janni> i guess, Hase^^on likes the sound of a dialing modem...
13:59:10 <Janni> somehow I miss it, since I have ADSL
13:59:47 <Janni> I think, I should give it out on the soundcard when connecting...
14:00:14 <Janni> or maybe the pc-speaker can imitate that sound?
14:08:45 <Marvin--> bubba1034: uh... come again?
14:25:28 <bubba1034> Marvin==: I want to define a type ( data f ) which is a function that maps a->b.
14:26:19 <bubba1034> Then I want to use that type, to declare a HOF that takes a function of type f ( a->b ), someother arguments
14:26:21 <Marvin--> a datatype is never a function, constructors however are functions
14:26:43 <bubba1034> and mape them into another function.
14:27:15 <bubba1034> You have to be able tomake generic function definitons. Otherwise HOF would be impossible.
14:27:53 <Marvin--> I'm not really following, an example?
14:31:13 <bubba1034> Ont that is too simple: define a type  a->b and a type b->c, then write a HOF that takes an argument of each type, and composes them: (a->b)->(b->c)->a->c.
14:32:15 <bubba1034> A more  complicated ( and realistic ) example:
14:33:02 <bubba1034> map::(a->b)->(M a -> M b) and join::: M (M a ) => M a
14:33:53 <bubba1034> I want to create the function, map f . join.
14:34:35 <Smerdyakov> So.... do it? =)
14:34:36 <Marvin--> but what do they have to do with data types?
14:35:52 <bubba1034> If I don't declare the first argument in map as a->b then the signature comes out wrong.
14:36:03 <bubba1034> Smerdyakov: How?
14:36:33 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, just type map f . join ?
14:37:59 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, you haven't really explained your problem yet...
14:39:24 <Smerdyakov> So, you could try again without assuming we know definitions of apparently nonstandard terms you use, or you could assume everyone here is too stupid to understand you. :P
14:40:13 <Marvin--> bubba1034: well... the type of map *is*  (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]...
14:40:14 <bubba1034> I'm pulling them out of a  paper, not *my* fault that Wadler can't use the same notation twice.
14:40:33 <Marvin--> bubba1034: if you want  (a -> b) -> f a -> f b  then it's fmap you want, in the Functor class
14:42:42 <bubba1034> Here is what I am getting: 1) I have to put \f-> in front ( obviously ) 
14:42:51 <bubba1034> Then I get map and join are undefined.
14:43:00 <Smerdyakov> You get that they are undefined when you do _what_?
14:43:09 <bubba1034> So what I want to do is declare the types of map and join.
14:43:22 <Smerdyakov> You have to state them in terms of type classes, I think....
14:43:30 <Smerdyakov> If you want them to be completely general like that.
14:43:40 <bubba1034> map is (a->b)->(M a -> M b)
14:44:11 <Smerdyakov> Would need a SomeTypeClass M => at the start or similar
14:44:37 <Smerdyakov> If you don't assume M belongs to a type class, there's no way you could possibly write that function!
14:44:47 <Marvin--> bubba1034: what language are you talking about? In *haskell*, map has the type  (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
14:45:15 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, are you trying to define a function that has that type for any M??
14:45:35 <Marvin--> bubba1034: fmap, though, has the type  Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
14:46:00 <shapr> <Marvin--> bubba1034: fmap, though, has the type  Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
14:46:00 <shapr> ERC> /me boings
14:46:03 <shapr> argh
14:46:06 <hdaume> haha
14:46:12 <hdaume> there'll be no boinging here
14:46:20 <shapr> minor client explosion...
14:46:21 * Marvin-- is listening to 'Maiden and singing
14:46:26 <Smerdyakov> It's unfortunate that functor has these two different meanings in Haskell and ML.
14:46:31 * shapr is listening to Ani DiFranco
14:46:33 <shapr> and singing
14:46:34 <Smerdyakov> In terms of concrete language features
14:47:17 <bubba1034> Sigh. Part have I haven't gotten to yet ( type classes ).
14:47:29 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, can you answer my question?
14:47:32 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, are you trying to define a function that has that type for any M?
14:47:33 <bubba1034> The paper that I'm looking at is:
14:47:45 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: in that case it should be a small m
14:47:45 <bubba1034> http://www.research.avayalabs.com/user/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/marktoberdorf.pdf
14:47:50 <bubba1034> section 3.
14:48:00 <shapr> I think I broke it again.
14:48:06 <bubba1034> Sorry Smerdyakov: Went hunting for the URL.
14:48:06 <shapr> oh no, it's still working..
14:48:08 <shapr> yay
14:48:24 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, OK, can I have a yes/no answer now?
14:49:08 <bubba1034> It's not clear to me that "any M" has meaning. It's a monad.
14:49:21 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, ah. Then you should have said so.
14:49:37 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, and you would need Monad m => at the start and changes M's to 'm's, I think.
14:49:46 <Smerdyakov> M isn't a magical abbreviation for Monad in Haskell.
14:50:31 <bubba1034> Sorry, I thought that was clear. Thats the *one* thing that Wadlker is consistent on notation waise.
14:50:44 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: M might be a concrete monadic type
14:50:44 <Smerdyakov> He may be consistent, but a Haskell compiler doesn't care....
14:50:46 * shapr grins
14:50:51 <Marvin--> bubba1034: well, it's not *haskell*
14:51:41 <Smerdyakov> bubba1034, is M a specific type, then?
14:51:52 <Smerdyakov> or rather, M a for some a....
14:51:58 <bubba1034> No it's for generic monads.
14:52:00 <Smerdyakov> OK, then you need Monad m => at the beginning.
14:52:07 <Smerdyakov> Without that, you have this unbound type variable M (though I guess it isn't parsed as a type variable because it's capitalized).
14:52:11 <Marvin--> bubba1034: and you have to call it something else than map, since map is already defined in the prelude
14:52:24 <Smerdyakov> I think you must explicitly declare type variables that take other type parameters themselves. (<-- probably using wrong terminology)
14:53:24 <Marvin--> I don't see why types of kind * -> * _have_ to be in type classes, why should they?
14:53:29 <Marvin--> or what do you mean Smerdyakov?
14:53:48 <Smerdyakov> I have coded basically no Haskell ever, so I don't know. I'm just extrapolating.
14:53:56 <Smerdyakov> <and now I'm away>
14:53:57 <bubba1034> You may be using the wrong terminology, but sounds almost exactly like my question.
14:53:58 <Marvin--> okay :)
14:54:17 <Marvin--> okay, so anyway, you want to write a function that works for any monad m
14:54:33 <Marvin--> then you need something like   foo :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
14:56:02 <bubba1034> I need to declare map, but all the info I have on it is that it maps a function of type a->b to a function of type Ma->Mb.
14:57:00 <bubba1034> Ok. I'm still not getting it. Is foo the type or the function?
14:57:19 <Marvin--> foo is the name of the function
14:57:32 <Marvin--> you can't call it map, since map is a pre-defined function
14:58:34 <bubba1034> Doen't like that, it says "variable not in sco[e"
14:58:47 <bubba1034> sorry s/sco[e]/scope/
14:58:49 <hdaume> you have to define the function too :)  you can't just have a type signature
14:59:45 <bubba1034> hduame: Which function? foo or it's arguments?
15:00:13 <Marvin--> bubba1034: a function has two parts, the type signature and the definition
15:00:30 <Marvin--> bubba1034: for example the identity function id has the type signature  id :: a -> a
15:00:33 <Marvin--> and the definition  id x = x
15:04:15 <bubba1034> But there is no definition for map . Only the signature. The function I'm trying to define is map f.join. where map::Monad m=>(a->b)->(m a -> m b)
15:04:51 <bubba1034> and join::Monad m => M ( M a ) -> M a
15:05:07 <hdaume> then you want to say 'foo = fmap f . join'
15:05:11 <hdaume> that's all you need
15:05:22 <Marvin--> map f . join is a composition of two functions, using map and join, have you defined them? and you *cannot* use map since map only works on lists in haskell
15:06:23 <bubba1034> hdaume: Yes. Except ( sorry ) I use the terms map and join because they are what they are called in the paper.
15:06:38 <bubba1034> They don't correspond to library functions.
15:07:29 <bubba1034> So basically I want to say foo = mymap f . join
15:07:45 <bubba1034> But I also wqant to specify that mymap has signature ...
15:08:19 <Marvin--> bubba1034: you give mymap's signature where you define mymap, not where you use mymap
15:08:50 <Marvin--> bubba1034: but if you desperately want to have a type signature on mymap in that expression you can write  foo = (mymap::yourtypesignaturehere) f . join
15:12:43 <bubba1034> So it should look like (Gawd ) foo = (mymap::Monad m=>(a->b)->(m a->m b) ) f. (myjoin::Monad m=>m( m a)->m b)?
15:14:04 <Marvin--> no, it shouldn't! :) you *can* write that, but you really really shouldn't
15:14:23 <bubba1034> Now I get an error "Quantified type variable escapes).
15:14:48 <bubba1034> Marvin--: WHy do you say that?
15:14:50 <Marvin--> well, have you defined mymap and myjoin yet?
15:15:10 <Marvin--> it makes much much more sense to give myjoin and mymap type signatures *where they are defined* instead of *where they are used*
15:15:15 <Marvin--> I really really do not see why you want to write that
15:15:23 <bubba1034> OK. I fixed that.
15:15:39 <bubba1034>  foo mymap myjoin f = (mymap::Monad m=>(a->b)->(m a->m b) ) f. (myjoin::Monad m=>m( m a)->m b)?
15:16:49 <hdaume> bubba1034: that won't work because it will think the two 'm's are different when in fact they're the same.  this is really complicated and there's really no reason you should have to write it like this.  just put the type sigs for mymap and myjoin at their point of definition, not of use
15:17:25 <hdaume> and why is foo taking mymap and myjoin as arguments?
15:18:22 <hdaume> anyway, i'm off until later...
15:20:21 <bubba1034> The latest:  foo (mymap::Monad m=>(a->b)->(m a->m b)) (myjoin::Monad m=>m ( m a)->m b) f = mymap f. myjoin
15:20:40 <Marvin--> looks horribly complicated
15:21:09 <bubba1034> I get "illegal signature in pattern" Use -fglasgow-exts to permit it.
15:21:23 <bubba1034> Marvin--: Hey monads!
15:21:36 <Marvin--> bubba1034: I keep telling you, separate the signature from the definition
15:21:44 <bubba1034> What does -fglasgow-exts do.
15:22:25 <Marvin--> allow you to use ghc extensions (some are experimental)
15:25:07 <bubba1034> Marvin how do I seperate the signature from the definition. ( I presume you mean the definition of foo, and not of mymap and myjoin, since they
15:25:11 <bubba1034> don'
15:25:18 <bubba1034> t have definitions.
15:27:11 <Marvin--> first, on one line, say   foo :: Monad m => ((a -> b) -> m a -> m b) -> (m (m a) -> m b) -> (a -> b) -> ... whatever the result type will be
15:28:05 <Marvin--> better yet ;) just write   foo mymap myjoin f = mymap f . myjoin   and then ask hugs or ghci what the type of foo is
15:29:13 <bubba1034> forall c a t b. (t -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> t -> a -> c
15:29:19 <bubba1034> Which is all wrong.
15:29:35 <Marvin--> well, it's probably the most general type it can figure out for it :)
15:30:15 <bubba1034> Which is the problem.
15:30:33 <bubba1034> I have to get ghci to "narrow" the type.
15:31:22 <Marvin--> then start by writing   foo mymap myjoin f = (mymap :: (a->b) -> m a -> m b) f . myjoin   and see what it says about that...?
15:31:22 <bubba1034> Actually the way I do it is better, since I'm not sure what type f is. ( Probably M a->M a, but I'm not sure. )
15:32:53 * Marvin-- shrugs
15:33:53 * Marvin-- sings with Bruce :-)
15:34:06 <Marvin--> "Bring me your daughter, bring me your daughter..."
15:34:22 <shapr> is that Iron Maiden?
15:34:34 <Marvin--> yup
15:34:47 * shapr swaps over to Jimi Hendrix doing Red House
15:35:00 <Marvin--> Jimi Hendrix is awesome :)
15:35:09 <shapr> yah, he's great
15:35:18 <shapr> I used to listen to Iron Maiden in the late 80s
15:35:21 <Marvin--> my strongest impression of him is when he does Amazing Grace at woodstock
15:35:22 * Riastradh thinks about doing that which shapr is doing, but decides that he will wait until this Mozart song is over.
15:35:27 <Janni> if you start then I have to continue: does anybody know Tortoise?
15:35:39 <Marvin--> Janni: can't say I do
15:35:41 <bubba1034> I have to go now. Thanks. 
15:35:48 <shapr> Janni: haven't heard of them, legally downloadable mp3s online somewhere?
15:35:53 <Janni> I didn't know them since a month ago
15:36:03 <esap> Janni: Tortoise was the character in Hofstadter's book.
15:36:09 <Marvin--> esap: duh :P
15:36:11 <shapr> I've picked up Orchard and Minister from http://www.mp3.com/ lately
15:36:13 <Janni> shapr: you could get them from my ftp
15:36:17 <shapr> esap: well, from Zeno's paradox really
15:36:23 <shapr> Janni: legal is important to me :-)
15:36:31 <Janni> shapr: it wouldn't be illegal
15:36:38 <Janni> i know you, you know me
15:36:39 <shapr> aren't they copyrighted?
15:36:43 <Janni> they are
15:36:48 <shapr> well, I'll pass then.
15:36:56 <Marvin--> shapr: that reminds me, if you want to read something really funny in Swedish, you should pick up a Swedish translation of Gödel Escher Bach (Hofstadter) and read the dialogues
15:37:00 <Janni> shapr: it isn't illegal
15:37:06 <Marvin--> Hofstadter knows some Swedish and thinks the translation is awesome
15:37:08 <shapr> Janni: how so?
15:37:15 <shapr> Marvin--: oh that sounds awesome =)
15:37:19 <Janni> it would be illegal if i provided to the public
15:37:37 <Janni> but it's legal to provide it to people you know
15:37:40 <shapr> I'm pretty sure duplication is limited to the fair use clause
15:37:52 <Janni> "fair use clause"
15:37:57 <Marvin--> in *civilized countries* it *is* fair use
15:38:04 <Janni> it's no problem if i burn a disc for my friends
15:38:08 <shapr> ??
15:38:10 <Janni> (which is copyrighted)
15:38:13 <Janni> shapr: of course
15:38:18 <shapr> huh?
15:38:21 <shapr> how so?
15:38:26 <Janni> shapr: you may not do so with software (programs)
15:38:35 <Marvin--> I don't know about other countries, but in Sweden it's legal to share copyrighted material with your friends and family
15:38:49 <Janni> shapr: i don't know if it's different in sweden (you live there, don't you?), but it is in germany
15:38:54 <shapr> !!
15:38:57 <shapr> that's amazing.
15:39:09 <shapr> do you have a reference to greater details somewhere?
15:39:26 <Marvin--> ... not aside from the Swedish law text I guess
15:39:35 <shapr> I bet my swedish will bounce right off that
15:39:43 <Janni> sharp: maybe in the usenet
15:39:47 <Janni> (in german :)
15:39:51 <shapr> heh
15:40:12 <Janni> shapr: but anyway. it is legal in germany to download illegally published stuff.
15:40:27 <Janni> so it is legal to "napster" as long as you don't _provide_ stuff
15:40:41 <shapr> amazing.
15:40:58 <Janni> shapr: most people don't know about their rigts in germany anyway
15:41:11 <Riastradh> Just like in some obscure town in Mississippi it's legal to buy ice cream, but not sell it.
15:41:18 <Marvin--> shapr: *my* Swedish bounces right off law text
15:41:20 <Janni> the industry does a good job in making the people believe that all that stuff is illegal
15:41:39 <Marvin--> Janni: exactly
15:41:57 * shapr grins
15:42:43 <Janni> shapr: so, you don't have to mind about german law, just check swedish law, if it is download copyrighted music from illegally published source
15:42:51 <Janni> +legal
15:43:00 <Janni> +to
15:43:44 <Marvin--> shapr: anyway I recall that a computer magazine here in Sweden actually asked some lawyers about this very thing in an article, and the lawyers said explicitly "Yes you can copy your CDs to your friends, it's fair use"
15:43:49 <Janni> if you may not, check if it is legal to provide copyrighted stuff to guys you know (as me)
15:43:52 <shapr> amazing.
15:43:55 <jlouis> heh, in Denmark it is legal to go to the nearest library, take the music home, copy it and archive it.
15:44:04 <jlouis> You may not hand it out to others though
15:44:13 <Marvin--> Janni: I think the downloading is a gray zone that hasn't been tested in the surpreme court yet
15:46:02 <shapr> is there some place where I can pay money to register a domain name the instant it expires?
15:46:32 <Marvin--> no idea
15:46:39 <Janni> shapr: btw, tortoise is some _good_ stuff. a mix of electronic, jazz and a bit rock. if you try something, then try the album TNT, ahh fuckit, just buy it, you won't regret it :)
15:46:50 <shapr> heh, ok :-)
15:47:38 <Marvin--> I just read some sort of proposed amendment to the paragraph about fair use
15:47:49 <shapr> I think the "Mother Russia" song from http://www.mp3.com/orchard is awesome
15:48:20 <Janni> i'd describe their quality as... calm power. even in tracks with a fast background beat have that calm power...
15:48:32 <shapr> it's like the tetris soundtrack on acid
15:48:36 <Marvin--> They propose to make it more strict so that it only encompasses copying for a single person for private usage in his home or something like that
15:48:44 <shapr> Janni: ok ok, can I get a representative track? :-)
15:48:53 <Marvin--> the fact that they want to clarify is it DOES imply that that's not what it says today, that today it is legal
15:49:20 <shapr> if you like indy chicks singing, Chicks on Speed are great fun
15:49:36 <shapr> they're munich based, one German, one Aussie, one US Citizen
15:49:42 <Janni> shapr: ftp://ftp.rochel.dyndns.org/
15:49:47 <Marvin--> and don't forget the damn fees you pay on recording media like casettes and CD-R discs
15:49:55 <Marvin--> the fees that go directly to compensate for piracy
15:50:45 <Marvin--> you could argue that that is "reasonable compensation"
15:51:15 <Marvin--> but now I really really really have to be off to bed :)
15:51:20 <shapr> g'night Marvin--!
15:51:40 <Marvin--> ph33r 0f +h3 d4rk!
15:51:50 <Marvin--> I have a phobia that someone's always there
15:52:14 <Marvin--> the problem with headphones is that you can't do any decent headbanging
16:31:01 <shapr> yow
16:32:49 * esap just wrote a comment to http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AclassIsNothingButaCyclicDependency
16:35:30 * shapr has just been reading http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgrammingIsFun
16:37:50 <shapr> esap: how does that compare with Typeclasses?
16:39:34 <esap> shapr: Hmm... type classes are just interfaces for data. What do you mean, do you mean comparing dependencies with interfaces?
16:40:01 <shapr> when you put it that way, it doesn't seem very close
16:41:03 <esap> shapr: the basic idea is that whever you find a loop somewhere, you need to change perspective.
16:42:56 <shapr> buggs: interesting
16:44:29 <buggs> i pasted sth
17:04:46 <shapr> yeehaa
17:44:25 <kawfee> hello
17:44:30 <shapr> hi
17:44:47 <kawfee> and it's "yeeeeehaaaaw"
17:45:27 <shapr> depends on where you come from
17:45:33 <kawfee> Texas
17:45:37 <shapr> I'm from Alabama, we can be quite reserved at time.
17:45:51 <kawfee> what part of the woods you live in?
17:46:00 <shapr> nowadays, I live in the woods of northern sweden.
17:46:15 <kawfee> born in US?
17:46:22 <shapr> Born in Selma, Alabama
17:46:31 <shapr> spent the largest part of my life in Birmingham
17:46:32 <kawfee> why are you in Sweden?
17:46:41 <shapr> there was this woman I met on ICQ...
17:46:44 <shapr> and here I am.
17:46:48 <kawfee> really?
17:46:53 <shapr> yes, really.
17:46:54 <kawfee> you met her on ICQ?
17:46:55 <shapr> four years ago or so
17:47:02 <shapr> ircqnet actually
17:47:02 <kawfee> oh wow
17:47:16 <shapr> even worse, an irc network run by ICQ
17:47:30 <kawfee> you pay taxes there?
17:47:35 <shapr> yup
17:47:44 <kawfee> it's what 50%?
17:48:06 <shapr> it's pretty high, but it's not so bad if you factor in free healthcare and free education
17:48:29 <kawfee> healtcare maybe, education dunno
17:48:33 <kawfee> how much education?
17:48:37 <shapr> as much as you want
17:48:53 <shapr> I'm 31, I'll be starting college soon.
17:49:01 <shapr> I'm getting free swedish classes at the moment.
17:49:06 <shapr> hi xj 
17:49:07 <kawfee> ahh
17:49:11 <kawfee> I was about to ask that
17:49:15 <xj> hi
17:49:22 <shapr> xj: learning Haskell?
17:49:40 <xj> yeah
17:49:47 <kawfee> that's quite amazing, meeting someone on the net and marrying
17:49:48 <xj> how about you?
17:49:59 <kawfee> did you keep your US citizenship?
17:50:08 <shapr> xj: I'm still learning Haskell also. I've been learning for about a year and a half.. it's great :-)
17:50:24 <shapr> kawfee: yes, though I could have swedish citizenship after being here for five years.
17:50:33 <kawfee> one more to go?
17:50:35 <shapr> I'd prefer to stay a US citizen though.
17:50:50 <shapr> kawfee: nah, I spent four years in Finland before this, only been here for three months or so :-)
17:50:51 <kawfee> you don't lose your US citizenship unless you denounce it
17:50:54 <kawfee> right?
17:51:10 <shapr> swedish citizenship isn't threadsafe
17:51:16 <kawfee> why not move to the US ?
17:51:19 <kawfee> threadsafe?
17:51:22 <shapr> can't combine it with US citizenship. ;-)
17:51:34 <shapr> it was a bad geeky joke
17:51:44 <kawfee> oh I see
17:51:47 <shapr> for the moment, I prefer living in Sweden.
17:51:54 <kawfee> hot girls?
17:51:55 <xj> there aren't any companies hiring here.
17:52:00 <shapr> sadly, the US is in the middle of a second McCarthy era :-(
17:52:08 <xj> < ny
17:52:12 <kawfee> shapr: what do you mean by that?
17:52:22 <shapr> kawfee: have you heard of McCarthyism?
17:52:27 <kawfee> nope
17:52:39 <shapr> kawfee: US history, try google
17:52:40 <kawfee> I've heard of Marksism
17:52:48 <kawfee> and Fascism
17:52:49 <shapr> not the same thing at all ;-)
17:52:52 <kawfee> right
17:52:59 <kawfee> and Dictatorship
17:52:59 <shapr> xj: how can I help you learn Haskell? how far have you gotten?
17:53:12 <kawfee> I am your Dictator!
17:53:34 <shapr> xj: have you seen http://www.haskell.org/learning.html ?
17:53:49 --- mode: ChanServ set +o shapr
17:53:55 <shapr> no, I'm the dictator ;-)
17:53:59 <xj> not very far at the moment. I want to ask if specifying types require alot of code. It seems this way to me.
17:54:17 <shapr> urk
17:54:23 <shapr> my irc client is being pissy
17:54:44 <shapr> xj: you don't need to specify types in Haskell usually
17:54:57 <shapr> even though Haskell is statically typed, it can infer the types on its own.
17:55:03 <shapr> most of my code doesn't have type signatures
17:55:29 --- mode: shapr set -o shapr
17:55:51 <shapr> xj: would you like to see some samples?
17:56:24 <kawfee> I have an expression evaluator up if you want to look
17:56:37 <xj> sure ok.
17:56:43 <Janni> xj: but to answer your question: you need very little code to specify types
17:57:04 <kawfee> haskell is strngly typed
17:57:07 <kawfee> strongly
17:57:27 <shapr> xj: this is the first thing I wrote in Haskell: http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/src/haskell/Mandelbrot-0.1.hs
17:57:31 <shapr> it's not very exciting...
17:57:47 <xj> anybody havin trouble with dalnet?
17:58:09 <shapr> I'm freenode only
17:58:17 <Janni> xj: no, i have no problem with dalnet
17:58:50 <xj> that's cute. ascii mandelbrot. sweet. :)
17:59:44 <shapr> so the type signatures look like "topside :: Double"
17:59:53 <kawfee> what's mandelbrot mean?
17:59:55 <shapr> and the value assignment is "topside = 1.0"
18:00:02 <kawfee> shapr: is it easy to find a job there?
18:00:07 <shapr> kawfee: it's Benoit Mandelbrot's last name.
18:00:24 <shapr> I do most of my work for a german university at the moment.
18:00:28 <Janni> i guess he wanted to create new types like: type Point = (Int, Int) or data Point a = Point a a
18:00:34 <kawfee> shapr: doing what?
18:00:59 <Janni> that Point example is so lame...
18:01:01 <shapr> kawfee: anything they need.. Zope, Python, Java, HTML, XML, XSLT, Linux admin, whatever
18:01:35 <shapr> I did a few elearning sites for them in Zope.
18:01:50 <kawfee> oh
18:02:01 <shapr> I can give you the urls if you want.
18:02:51 <shapr> I'd rather be doing it in Haskell of course :-)
18:04:59 <shapr> xj: any other questions?
18:05:59 <xj> what is graph reduction as it applicable to haskell?
18:06:38 <shapr> er, in what context?
18:06:51 <shapr> implementation of functional languages?
18:06:55 <shapr> haskell source code to do graph reduction?
18:10:12 <xj> presentation of code.
18:11:42 <shapr> huh?
18:12:13 <shapr> how does graph reduction apply to presentation of Haskell source code?
18:13:36 <shapr> I don't understand your question.
18:13:51 * shapr suspects megahal at work here...
18:14:47 <xj> Are there any ways to infer of inherit types in haskell?
18:15:35 <shapr> type inferencing is standard
18:16:01 <xj> ah
18:16:05 <xj> the example you gave has it.
18:16:11 <shapr> yup
18:16:19 <xj> :P
18:16:26 <shapr> inheritance doesn't really happen in standard that I've seen.
18:16:30 <shapr> you don't usually need it.
18:16:49 <shapr> if you really want the same sort of thing, you can use typeclass constraints 
18:17:19 <xj> thought I think my question is, do you always have to specify a type.
18:17:34 <shapr> no, you almost never have to specify a type.
18:17:57 <shapr> xj: download that Mandelbrot source, run it once..
18:18:03 <shapr> then comment out the type signatures and try it again.
18:22:25 <xj> so what your telling me is if I take out all of the :: statements, it will still work.
18:22:32 <shapr> yup
18:23:08 <xj> oh. 
18:23:18 <xj> :)
18:23:18 <xj> cool
18:25:05 <shapr> hi flippo 
18:25:58 <flippo> Howdy, shapr.  Got my copy of hudak today.
18:26:00 <flippo> shapr: Unfortunately, I didn't realize the book depends on some unportable graphics library.  Doh!
18:26:11 <shapr> SOEGraphics runs on win32 and linux
18:26:22 <flippo> shapr: I should have waited for Thompson to come back in print
18:26:23 <shapr> what OS do you want to run it on?
18:26:39 <flippo> shapr: the intro only mentioned NT and Winblows.
18:27:00 <flippo> shapr: Linux is what I use, so I guess I'm okay.  Yay.
18:27:09 <shapr> http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/soe/index.htm
18:27:48 <shapr> I haven't gone through Hudak, only Thompson
18:28:01 <shapr> maybe I should try to follow you through Hudak ;-)
18:28:16 <flippo> I don't much care for graphics programming, so I'm a bit let down
18:28:56 <flippo> I was too embarrassed to return it after badgering my bookstore
18:29:35 <shapr> Chilli prefers Hudak over Thompson, and he's been teaching Haskell for years.
18:30:14 <flippo> I'll give it a fair shot then.  But students have low attention spans.  Graphics might keep their interest longer.
18:30:16 <shapr> so the Hudak book must be good for something :-)
18:30:32 <shapr> you could keep track of your progress on the HaskellWiki
18:30:43 <shapr> or maybe you have a blog or personal wiki?
18:30:48 <flippo> I enjoyed the Algorithms book enormously.
18:30:52 <shapr> me too!!
18:30:58 <shapr> that book is great!
18:31:06 <shapr> I can't find my copy at the moment though :-(
18:31:09 <flippo> I'm rereading it a second time and getting more out of it
18:31:27 <shapr> Burstall and Darlington are my heros ;-)
18:31:38 <flippo> I need to come at the language from different angles I've discovered.
18:31:52 <shapr> I found I can apply their stuff to Java and Python just as well.
18:32:17 <shapr> I think Haskore is in Hudak
18:32:18 <flippo> Yes, the transformation approach is very very appealing.  
18:32:27 * shapr looks at his copy of Hudak
18:33:53 <flippo> "Note:  the code in the text was developed under Windows.  Although all examples have been successfully tested under Linux, the Windows version is likely to be the most robust."
18:34:15 <flippo> Universities should not be teaching with Evil software
18:34:18 <shapr> I can't find the SOEGraphics download on that website, but I have use SOEGraphics on Linux before.
18:35:10 <shapr> I was a real pain on the Haskell mailing list when I got Hudak and SOEGraphics was win32 only
18:35:28 <flippo> good for you.  Stand up for Justice!
18:35:29 <shapr> some months later, there was a Linux version
18:35:37 <shapr> yes! open source! yay!
18:37:51 <shapr> flippo: found it: http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/graphics/downloading.html
18:37:56 <shapr> you may have found that already
18:39:16 <flippo> no google was not being as helpful as usual
18:40:08 <flippo> I was looking for soegraphics.  This seems to be called hgl graphics.
18:40:35 <shapr> I vaguely recall it stands for Hugs Graphics Library
18:40:45 <flippo> Good.  I use hugs.
18:43:00 <shapr> hi metal-grid 
18:43:21 <metal-grid> hi - how's it going...
18:43:30 <shapr> life is good, I have food and hardware :-)
18:43:50 <metal-grid> coffe and pizza?
18:43:56 <shapr> well, coffee and salad
18:45:21 <metal-grid> anything new in the world of Haskell?
18:46:44 <shapr> new xml toolbox
18:46:51 <shapr> the GUI mailing list is hopping
18:47:09 <shapr> ghc 5.04.3 is about to be released, hopefully with stable Template Haskell support
18:47:24 <shapr> the Obfuscated Haskell Contest has just passed the submission deadline
18:47:43 <shapr> (and I need to judge the entries quickly! )
18:47:55 <shapr> should I go on? :-)
18:48:20 <metal-grid> ok - those are in indeed interesting... but...
18:48:50 <metal-grid> I'm wondering if there's any work going on for parallelism expression in the Haskell community?
18:48:55 <shapr> sure
18:49:03 <shapr> Manuel Chakravarty is working on parr
18:49:09 <shapr> it's an array flattening and unrolling library
18:49:21 <shapr> He's focussed on Data Parallelism
18:49:30 <metal-grid> It's not part of the language proper is it?  An extension?
18:49:41 <shapr> it is an extension, but easily installed.
18:49:49 <shapr> his further plans are to add MPI support.
18:49:53 <shapr> I can barely wait for that!
18:50:09 <shapr> distributed array processing in Haskell.. mmm good
18:50:36 <metal-grid> I'm interested in targeting multi-core CPU's
18:50:43 <shapr> hyperthreading?
18:50:47 <shapr> or SMP?
18:51:00 <metal-grid> NUMA - like an Intel Network Processor
18:51:03 <shapr> ah
18:51:11 <shapr> I don't know about NUMA specifically
18:51:29 <metal-grid> NUMA = Non Uniform Memory Access = ugly and difficult...
18:51:34 <shapr> I do know about hMPI, lets you run Haskell on top of MPI
18:52:04 <shapr> hMPI, GdH, GPH, and parr are the things that come to mind without hitting google
18:53:33 <metal-grid> I guess the thing I need to know is the internal representation of the Haskell source as interpreted by the compiler
18:53:43 <metal-grid> does it go into something as nice as a Haskell DOM?
18:53:56 <shapr> at what level?
18:54:03 <shapr> Haskell Source becomes External Core
18:54:06 <metal-grid> DOM = Document Object Model a.k.a.  Abstract Syntax Tree?
18:54:11 <shapr> which is a very simple functional language
18:54:27 <shapr> underneath that, GHC is a spineless tagless G-machine
18:54:43 <shapr> rather that graph reduction or something (which I think other FPLs use)
18:55:16 <shapr> which of those levels are you interested in?
18:55:22 <metal-grid> External Core?  What's that - pardon my ignorance of Haskell - I'm ramping up
18:55:54 <shapr> it's the compilers internal representation of Haskell, very much simplified from the source.
18:56:00 <shapr> should I stick some online? would you like to see?
18:56:34 <metal-grid> sure - lay it on the line...
18:57:03 <shapr> http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/src/haskell/HelloWorld.hs
18:57:04 <shapr> versus
18:57:10 <shapr> http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/src/haskell/HelloWorld.hcr
18:57:29 <shapr> that's external core
18:58:00 <xj> lisp!
18:58:34 <shapr> I've read a bit about external core and the spineless tagless g-machine (aka STG) but just a small bit.
18:59:05 <shapr> xj: supposedly ext core is just a simple functional language
18:59:47 <shapr> metal-grid: is that what you're looking for?
19:00:32 <shapr> hi kyagrd 
19:00:38 <kyagrd> hello
19:00:39 <andersca> night everyone
19:00:44 <shapr> g'nite andersca 
19:00:53 <shapr> I am soon to sleep also.
19:00:56 <kyagrd> this is day in the far east,
19:01:13 <kyagrd> Korea, Neclue ... big problem here :-(
19:01:54 <shapr> next week I'll be a morning person the other end, maybe I'll see you then? :-)
19:02:01 <shapr> um, "from the other end"
19:02:55 <metal-grid> shapr: looks kind of ugly - but I guess I shouldn't expect otherwise
19:03:22 <metal-grid> would there be an expression of threading or parallelism at this level - or only at the source?
19:03:24 <shapr> yah, intermediate representations don't look so nice.
19:03:59 <metal-grid> wrt intermediates - I've seen newer source and object management systems using DOMs
19:04:02 <kawfee> parrallelism?
19:05:03 <metal-grid> kawfee: ultimate goal - write code to a "single machine" - compile to mutli-CPU machine
19:05:13 <metal-grid> need to identify parallelism paths
19:05:22 <metal-grid> source annotations make it easier
19:05:37 <metal-grid> w/o source annotations - compiler needs to inference
19:05:38 <shapr> yah, one of the parallel haskell flavors uses par and seq
19:05:44 <shapr> as parallelization hints
19:06:12 <shapr> Concurrent Haskell is the threading stuff, so it's obviously parallelizable
19:06:47 <shapr> I prefer Chakravarty's parr lib, because it's transparently parallel
19:07:10 <shapr> he says it's MPMD 'multiple program multiple data'
19:07:46 <metal-grid> cool - I think it's MIMD?  Multi Instruction Multiple Data...
19:07:53 <shapr> usually it is
19:08:03 <shapr> but with data parallelism it's MPMD
19:08:28 <metal-grid> I thought that's SIMD?
19:09:18 <shapr> http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/docs/mpichman-chshmem/node107.htm
19:10:06 <shapr> the parr lib --> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/nepal/
19:13:23 <shapr> from what I've read, MPMD really does exist
19:14:10 <metal-grid> can't really tell what it is - but sounds interesting
19:23:55 <kawfee> metal-grid: shared memmory ?
19:25:23 <metal-grid> kawfee: no - NUMA
19:25:41 <metal-grid> multi-core CPU
19:25:46 <metal-grid> but not SMP
19:26:00 <kawfee> then you need to add some communication
19:26:30 <metal-grid> yes - an 'ipc fix-up' between 'remoted' invocations - but has to be transparent
19:26:43 <metal-grid> compiler generated
19:29:40 <shapr> nearly time to fall over asleep
19:30:23 <flippo> shapr: I hope you sleep late and devote enough time to rapid eye movement
19:30:28 <metal-grid> shapr: so I guess the coffee was decaf?
19:30:44 <flippo> sleep is essential for proper brain function
19:32:54 <shapr> metal-grid: it's 4:30am, all the coffee has worn off....
19:33:07 * shapr falls over asleep
19:33:15 <flippo> shapr: sleeep ... sleeeep
19:44:43 <metal-grid> roses are red, violets are blue, I'm schizophrenic, and so am I...
19:44:47 <metal-grid> g'night...
23:28:35 <bubba1034> Anyone here?
23:30:16 <mgoetze> nope
23:30:29 <mgoetze> noone but us lurkers
23:32:17 <kyagrd> I am here
23:39:10 <bubba1034> I can't seem to be able to define types in ghci.
23:40:53 <dennisb> bubba1034: you have the definition in a file and load it in?
23:41:37 <bubba1034> Do I have to put it in a file? Can I type it in from the prompt?
23:41:57 <dennisb> I don't think you can type in datatype declarations
23:43:08 <bubba1034> I was a fraid of that. Is there a Haskell command that acts similarly to :t or :i?
23:43:58 <dennisb> just put the definition in a file and load it with :l
23:44:24 <dennisb> you can still use ghci
23:53:06 <dennisb> bubba1034: did it work?
23:53:53 <bubba1034> Still working on it.
23:56:06 <bubba1034> Do you have to include some module and export symbol declaration on top of the file?
23:56:14 <dennisb> no
23:56:20 <dennisb> should work anyway
23:57:05 <dennisb> Hmm
23:57:13 <dennisb> maybe you do need it. "module Foo where" on top
23:58:00 <dennisb> you get a warning otherwise
23:58:20 <dennisb> Here is a complete file foo.hs:
23:58:23 <dennisb> module Foo where
23:58:24 <dennisb> data Name = Dennis | Bubba
23:59:23 <dennisb> I have to leave. Good luck with your modules
