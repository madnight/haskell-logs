04:35:34 <earthy> morning kosmikus
04:41:15 <kosmikus> hi earthy -- where are you?
04:54:05 * earthy is in A'dam. why?
04:54:12 <earthy> (last day at old job)
04:54:29 <earthy> how was the icfpcontest? :)
04:55:47 <kosmikus> in the case that they fetch my Sun today -- do you want to use my monitor?
04:56:01 <kosmikus> icfpcontest was funny, but we were not good enough ...
04:56:34 <earthy> kosmikus: *yes*
04:57:02 <earthy> let them haul that big CRT away. :)
04:57:18 <earthy> EXPN `not good enough'? :)
04:58:50 <kosmikus> We had ~85k in the end. Apparently some teams have 77k or less ...
04:59:01 <earthy> not *wildly* off then
04:59:06 <kosmikus> no
04:59:23 <kosmikus> but still significantly
05:11:07 <earthy> those tracks look rather nasty
05:15:32 <kosmikus> earthy: our solutions are at ~eelco/icfppc2003
05:16:50 <Marvin--> hey, me wanna see too
05:17:54 <earthy> marvin--: wanna see the solutions or wanna see the tracks? (the latter is an almost trivial task)
05:18:26 <Marvin--> I've seen the tracks, I participated in Team #haskell
05:18:34 <Marvin--> I want to see your solution
05:18:55 <Marvin--> this is the first time I participated in the icfp contest, so it's going to be very very interesting to read about others' solutions
05:19:24 <Marvin--> (too bad we didn't actually get to the point of submitting anything, with only six hours left we realized that our approach wouldn't work)
05:20:35 <kosmikus> Marvin--: the path I gave is below www.cs.uu.nl
05:21:25 <earthy> marvin--: the full URL kosmikus gave was 
05:21:34 <earthy> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~eelco/icfppc2003/
05:21:43 <earthy> (I *hate* laggy internetconnectivity)
05:22:23 <earthy> so, kosmikus, what did you do? curve-fitting?
05:25:00 <kosmikus> no, after discussing possible approaches for about one day, we decided that we, not having any knowledge about such things, would have a hard time to beat human intelligence and wrote an editor
05:26:02 <earthy> I'd have tried flooding with vector-ranges...
05:31:54 <Marvin--> kosmikus: oh, so your program is interactive?
05:32:04 <kosmikus> yes
05:32:18 <kosmikus> but not real-time
05:32:40 <Marvin--> our first approach was in the area of skeletonization and thinning, and then we worked on an A* approach
05:32:52 <earthy> A*?
05:33:03 <Marvin--> and during the last six hours we tried to hack something together based on the gradient field :-P
05:33:13 <Marvin--> earthy: heuristic shortest path algorithm, used a lot in AI I think
05:33:18 <earthy> ah
05:34:52 <vegai> @prelude !!
05:34:54 <lambdabot> *** "!!" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
05:34:54 <lambdabot> !!
05:34:54 <lambdabot>   See (!!)
05:35:05 <kosmikus> apparently A* has been used by others -- why didn't it work for you?
05:35:06 * vegai slaps his forehead.
05:35:30 <vegai> does the bot work on private...
05:35:35 <Marvin--> I think it was because we were not agressive enough at culling away equivalent paths
05:35:40 <vegai> ...yes.
05:36:14 <Marvin--> I have some ideas, but our major problem was that we basically couldn't get off the first pixel ;)
05:36:30 <Marvin--> and since our heuristic was pixel-based (well, interpolated, but pixel-based)...
05:38:21 <kosmikus> well, at least it was a good motivation for me to try wxHaskell ...
05:38:29 <vegai> hmh, the PLEAC-Haskell examples don't work on ghci. Normal?
05:38:33 <Marvin--> we used gtk2hs
05:38:52 <earthy> ah yes, the mythical wxHaskell. :)
05:39:59 <kosmikus> there still are some issues, but it looks very promising -- haven't looked at gtk2hs, though; that might be very good as well
05:40:47 <Marvin--> seeing as juhp was on the team, he did the gtk2hs programming ;)
05:41:48 <kosmikus> earthy: your new monitor has just been connected and set up
05:41:59 <earthy> *whee*! :)
05:42:08 <earthy> no more crampedness ;)
05:42:36 <kosmikus> and ... you finally have full 50% of the office ;)
05:42:46 <vegai> ...more precisely, the examples use the !!-operator with a list, ie: s!![2,3]
05:42:58 <vegai> ghci excepts an Int
05:43:28 <kosmikus> stupid question: what's PLEAC?
05:43:33 <Marvin--> vegai: eh? maybe they have their own !! operator that's not related to the one in the prelude?
05:43:53 <Marvin--> vegai: I don't see how it'd work in hugs either
05:46:25 <kosmikus> just looked at the page -- yes, they define their own !! in the Helpers module at the end
05:46:39 <kosmikus> they define many things there -- almost no example will work without that module
05:47:15 <Marvin--> so import Prelude hiding ((!!))
05:49:15 <Marvin--> I wonder what we could've done with the gradient approach had we started out with it :)
05:49:22 <vegai> Marvin--: ah, that happens often?
05:51:06 <Marvin--> vegai: not really... but sometimes you want to use existing names, like in the icfp contest we had our own very different 'div' operation
05:52:36 <vegai> Marvin--: if they are using their own !!-operator, they're being pretty evil about it -- not defining it in the example =)
05:52:45 <Marvin--> vegai: yes, that's evil
05:58:32 * earthy coughs
05:58:41 <earthy> did they *have* to shut down atlantis?
05:59:05 <vegai> atlantis?
05:59:06 <Marvin--> I thought atlantis sunk? :)
05:59:19 <earthy> atlantis.cs.uu.nl is my workstation :)
05:59:35 <earthy> now I've lost state. :)
05:59:54 <kosmikus> sorry -- couldn't do anything about it; I didn't expect him (HvL) to, but suddenly it was off
06:00:01 <kosmikus> much?
06:00:07 <earthy> not much. :)
06:00:35 <earthy> ofcourse, I tend to hotplug VGA, which is not the nicest thing to do either...
06:00:53 <Marvin--> been there, done that
06:01:02 <Marvin--> hotplugging PS2 keyboards doesn't really work all that well either
06:01:22 <Marvin--> but I've been lucky so far (knock on wood)
06:01:25 <earthy> actually, I've never had problems with it. ;)
06:01:47 <earthy> and given some keyboard/mouse/monitor switches I've seen the stuff is almost designed to be hotpluggable. ;)
06:02:40 <earthy> (the trick is to use your fingers as ground-bridge between the shielding of the male and the female connector)
06:10:28 * Heffalump gets up
06:28:17 <kosmikus> good morning, Heffalump
06:28:46 <Heffalump> hiya
06:29:08 <Heffalump> was Daan on your team, or did you just use wxHaskell anyway?
06:32:14 <Marvin--> uh-oh, trying to turn this into GUI politics?
06:32:17 <Marvin--> ;)
06:33:51 <Heffalump> nono, I was just wondering :-) I hadn't heard of it at all until he showed it to me on Friday.
06:34:54 <Marvin--> we had a GUI person on the team, which is good, 'cause I hate constructing GUIs, it's too hard
06:35:21 <Heffalump> we had one GUI person who wrote some Java for us for the difficult visualisation problems
06:35:35 <Heffalump> and Igloo did some evil hacking of PPM files with perl scripts for the easy ones
06:36:03 <Heffalump> I should learn about PPM, it's useful (and trivial really, but having practice editing them semi-automatically is clearly useful)
06:36:11 <SyntaxPolice> woop!
06:36:14 <SyntaxPolice> how did the contest go?
06:36:53 <Heffalump> not well, for us :-)
06:37:20 <SyntaxPolice> :(
06:38:34 * tmoertel requires coffee
06:40:43 <Heffalump> someone mentioned the Dylan team yesterday - does anyone know how their entry worked?
06:41:05 <tmoertel> It worked well, from what I saw of its scored.
06:41:22 <Marvin--> Heffalump: at least you got the car into the goal without crashing, didn't you?
06:46:28 <Heffalump> true
06:46:40 <Heffalump> though that took until about 6am on Monday morning :-)
06:47:05 <Marvin--> that doesn't tell me a lot, what's that in GMT?
06:47:18 <Marvin--> or was that GMT?
06:47:35 <Heffalump> 5am GMT I think
06:47:39 <Heffalump> it's only an approximate time anyway
06:48:56 <Marvin--> well, 6am USA != 6am Europe, but now that I think about it, I know you're in .uk
06:49:26 <Marvin--> (sorry, I'm tired, I've gone on five hours sleep per night the last four nights or so, I'm at work right now and they're poking fun at me, calling me a zombie and stuff)
06:49:38 * SyntaxPolice pokes Marvin--
06:49:40 <reltuk> ghc takes a long long time to compile  :)
06:49:54 <SyntaxPolice> yes, yes it does.
06:49:56 <earthy> realtuk: depends on your hardware.
06:50:18 <earthy> I manage to get 4.08.2, 5.04.3 and 5.04.3 to build in the space of about 10 hours
06:50:36 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice :-/
06:50:44 <reltuk> earthy: well...of course...but I've got it compiling on a 2 ghz p4 distcc'd with an 1800+ xp, and two p3 1gigs and it's takin' quite a while
06:50:48 * Marvin-- wanders off on a quest for more coffee
06:50:49 <earthy> (yes, I'm a stickler for bootstrapping from nothing ;))
06:51:06 <reltuk> 10 hours...holy crap...I didn't know it was going to take *that* long
06:51:08 <earthy> realtuk: scaling that would imply some 3 to 4 hours' worth of compilation time
06:51:25 <reltuk> what's it got that makes it take so long?
06:51:35 <earthy> the libs take *awful* amounts of time to build
06:51:52 <reltuk> I can't distcc anything ghc'd...
06:52:00 <reltuk> only the C/C++ compiling
06:52:04 <earthy> you have added EXTRA_HC_OPTS=-H256M or something to the mk/build.mk, right?
06:52:26 <reltuk> it's passing 16M to the build atm
06:52:38 <reltuk> I was testing the ebuild on Gentoo
06:52:42 <earthy> increase that. speeds things up quite a bid. :)
06:52:49 <earthy> s/bid/bit/
06:53:00 <reltuk> it'll want to restart.../me bursts into tears  :-p
06:53:48 <reltuk> is haskell just intensive to compile?
06:53:54 <SyntaxPolice> now that I've started reading debian-devel, I notice a trend.  Post something to the list, get flamed, post, flame... Truly you have to have a thick skin to work with free software.
06:54:22 <Marvin--> for exactly that reason, I don't read -devel regularly
06:54:27 <Marvin--> too much noise
06:55:16 <SyntaxPolice> yeah really.  this poor NM decided he wanted to package a program called email which does a bunch of stupid things and is non-free.  You can immagine how that went.
06:55:20 <earthy> reltuk: the compiler itself isn't too bad, that gets done in 15 minutes to half an hour.
06:55:34 <earthy> then the compilationprocess uses that to compile all the libs
06:55:39 <earthy> that takes *shitloads* of time
06:55:41 <SyntaxPolice> How many times do you think he needs to be told what a bad idea it is.
06:55:45 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: yes I can imagine :)
06:56:00 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: until he bursts into tears and promises to never touch Debian again!
06:56:06 <SyntaxPolice> yeah really :(
06:56:18 <earthy> `and good riddance' :)
06:56:29 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: Debian is elitist, it's true, but being on the "inside" you *do* get tired of being asked the same questions over and over and over again
06:56:41 <SyntaxPolice> OTOH, I posted about APT Secure and no one followed up, so I take that as a complement
06:56:46 <reltuk> earthy: I mean is haskell (libraries written in haskell) hard to compile from a computational standpoint
06:56:55 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: understandable
06:57:37 <earthy> reltuk: well, yeah. especially if you have a small heap.
06:57:43 <Marvin--> like when the Nth person tells me "the sarge installer is broken"...
06:57:47 <Marvin--> NO SHIT?
06:59:07 <SyntaxPolice> yeah that is annoying.  but really; you can write a form-letter email and paste it in, or use an emacs keybinding if you're using GNUs to auto-reply.
06:59:13 <vegai> Marvin--: humans respond to repeated questions by ignoring
06:59:24 * vegai runs away before Marvin-- flames him.
06:59:28 <Marvin--> vegai: :)
06:59:53 <SyntaxPolice> I was arguing w/ walters the other day about whether its bad for people to file bugs about small feature requests all the time.  I argued that there's nothing wrong with it since its nice to have a to-do list, even for trivial things.
07:00:03 <SyntaxPolice> but he disagreed, as most people probably would.
07:00:03 * reltuk settles for ghc-bin   :)
07:00:05 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: I copy&paste the "The sarge installer is still in beta, if all you want is a working sarge system, install woody and dist-upgrade, however if you want to help testing the new installer..." replies
07:00:11 <Marvin--> s/beta/alpha/
07:00:20 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: yeah, makes sense.
07:01:11 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: the problem here is that the web site isn't clear enough about what's on the sarge CDs and I don't know who to turn to to get it changed (and if I talk to the wrong person I'll be flamed :) but I guess I should just put on my asbesthos underwear...)
07:01:55 <SyntaxPolice> yeah.  As a new debian person, I'm deciding to post and get flamed if necessary if Walters can't answer my question :)
07:02:56 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: fwiw, I agree with you about feature request bugs, there's nothing *wrong* in having a gazillion 'wishlist' and 'minor' bugs in the BTS, it just means you're popular, and it's a good way for interested parties to know what they can do to help
07:03:27 <Marvin--> heck, look at the two currently open bugs on pyopenssl :)
07:07:53 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: That was my argument too.
07:12:01 <Marvin--> what was walters' argument?
07:12:37 <debug> gmorning
07:12:39 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: I think he basically agreed w/ me in theory, but found it annoying to have to deal with them and to have open bugs on his packages.
07:12:59 <Marvin--> oookay
07:13:10 <Marvin--> well, he's got more packages than I do
07:13:36 <Marvin--> but I guess the d-i packages don't show up in the statistics for that matter
07:13:50 <debug> tic
07:14:12 <tic> debug-mug
07:14:16 <debug> :)
07:14:51 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: and there was a recent argument about a mass  bug-filing as a wishlist item for better package discriptions where people seemed to agree that it was annoying.
07:15:28 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: I agree that mass-filing wishlist bugs is kinda silly, mass-filing important bugs is one thing, but wishlist..?
07:17:02 <SyntaxPolice> but you just agreed that its OK to have a bunch of wishlist bugs open on your package, what does it matter if its  a mass-filing?
07:18:34 <SyntaxPolice> sorry for dragging the channel so far off-topic BTW :-)
07:19:18 <Marvin--> point :)
07:19:36 <Marvin--> I've never claimed to be particularly consistent though
07:20:22 <SyntaxPolice> who is? ;)
07:21:27 <Marvin--> "The Apache web server is the most common application on the Linux platform. Novell has released it as open source under the General Public License." (freely translated from Swedish, source: the ComputerSweden magazine)
07:26:02 <steveh> heh
07:26:07 <steveh> Novell did that eh? :)
07:26:37 <Marvin--> they seem to know a lot that I don't at that magazine :)
07:26:57 * SyntaxPolice has no idea where apache came from
07:27:12 <steveh> SyntaxPolice: ask and ye shall receive: http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html
07:27:21 * steveh remembers the old httpd...
07:28:08 <SyntaxPolice> I wish I could have monadic pattern matching or guards, I Hate to extract a boolean from the state just to make a Case statement which will hold the entire function
07:28:29 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: amen!
07:28:33 <SyntaxPolice> I admit that I partly hate it because emacs-mode isn't awesome
07:28:34 <Heffalump> you can have guards, can't you?
07:28:56 <tmoertel> Marvin--: I got our gradient-follower to reach the goal.
07:29:05 <shapr> yay!
07:29:06 <Heffalump> if you use a monad where fail is mzero
07:29:09 <SyntaxPolice> hi shapr
07:29:12 <shapr> hi SyntaxPolice 
07:29:12 <Marvin--> tmoertel: cool!
07:29:14 <Heffalump> tmoertel: how'd your entry work, then?
07:29:24 <tmoertel> slowly
07:29:27 * Marvin-- cvs up:s
07:29:28 * shapr grins
07:29:46 <Heffalump> heh, sounds like ours
07:29:49 <tmoertel> see http://icfp2003.lab09.moertel.com/news
07:29:55 <Heffalump> it needed 5-10 minutes to do each track
07:30:11 <tmoertel> whoops!  that's: http://icfp2003.moertel.com/news
07:30:42 <Marvin--> tmoertel: heh, it didn't notice it hit the goal? :-)
07:31:05 <tmoertel> no, it wanted to win again and again and ...
07:31:14 * shapr grins
07:31:18 <tmoertel> the top speed is just 0.1 px/turn
07:31:20 <Marvin--> having 0.1 as max speed is kinda horrible in terms of efficiency :-)
07:31:27 <Heffalump> we had a nasty heuristic for guessing when we'd finished
07:31:46 <Marvin--> so there's no other differences? We still don't handle braking? :-)
07:31:53 <tmoertel> I'm working on a meta-adjuster that will provide braking hints, so that we can drive at a more crusing-like speed.
07:31:56 <Heffalump> it failed on one of the maps and it just kept driving in a straight line into the wall
07:32:08 <Heffalump> tmoertel: what kind of paths are you trying to follow?
07:32:32 <shapr> Marvin--: hey, we have moshez on the phone here :-)
07:32:43 <tmoertel> we're following a gradient that points toward the shortest path to the goal
07:32:47 <Marvin--> shapr: :)
07:32:51 <Marvin--> shapr: he squished me today!
07:32:57 <shapr> heh
07:32:58 <Heffalump> how do you decide what speed to go at?
07:33:10 <tmoertel> we're not
07:33:18 <Marvin--> Heffalump: remember that this is the code that we started working on with six hours left of the contest...
07:33:25 <Heffalump> oh dear :-)
07:33:26 <tmoertel> we just pick a Really Slow Speed and use friction to slow us down
07:33:42 <Heffalump> ah, right
07:33:50 <Marvin--> Heffalump: where we ripped out everything but the floating point module and the distance field...
07:33:56 <Heffalump> we had a lightning entry that drove at a constant speed, and we just turned down the speed until it could finish each track
07:34:15 <Marvin--> yeah, I imagine that's what the lightning entries did
07:34:16 <Heffalump> how do you find the shortest path to the goal, A*?
07:34:35 <Marvin--> we had our own little lightning division contest what with the six hours left ;)
07:34:45 <Heffalump> hehe
07:34:50 <tmoertel> yeah, we just picked the wrong day to start it   ;-)
07:34:58 <shapr> yeah :-)
07:35:03 <Marvin--> Heffalump: this code uses a gradient field to determine where to go
07:35:16 <Marvin--> based on rough estimations of distance-to-goal
07:35:19 <tmoertel> Heffalump: we use Dijkstra's algo from the goals to assign the approximate distance of each pixel to the goal
07:35:38 <Heffalump> which pixels?
07:35:41 <Marvin--> tmoertel: wonder if it'll be smoother when we add interpolation of the gradient vectors
07:35:41 <tmoertel> see http://icfp2003.moertel.com/field-working
07:36:04 <Heffalump> our major problem was the path finding stuff
07:36:11 <Heffalump> once we had a straight line path stuff seemed ok
07:36:31 <Marvin--> http://tinyurl.com/fqbo <- LOL
07:36:56 <Heffalump> funny why?
07:37:06 <shapr> Marvin--: amsterdam to malmö?
07:37:18 <Marvin--> because all those cities are in Sweden, except for Amsterdam
07:37:35 <Marvin--> shapr: no, Hässleholm to Malmö via Nässjö, Amsterdam and Lund
07:37:43 <shapr> ah
07:39:05 <Heffalump> taking a train from Holland to Sweden is a silly idea, then?
07:39:27 <Heffalump> I wouldn't have thought it was _that_ far, though maybe you'd want to stop places in between :-)
07:39:30 <shapr> train from Oxford to Uppsala?
07:39:44 <shapr> I think Oxford is closer than Amsterdam.
07:39:45 <Marvin--> Heffalump: you mean, taking a train from Sweden to Sweden *via* Holland
07:39:49 <Heffalump> Marvin--: ah :-)
07:39:58 <Heffalump> shapr: no tunnel under the North Sea, though :-)
07:40:37 <shapr> aw
07:40:59 <Marvin--> tmoertel: it still seems to fail on 1_Simple though
07:42:10 <Marvin--> gah, it's obvious that I'm not getting anything done here, way too tired, I'm going home
07:42:17 <tmoertel> yes, we'll need to add braking smarts to have reliable driving
07:42:59 <Marvin--> heh, when I showed the train image to a friend in Holland he said "come visit!"
08:13:50 <hdaume> hey all
08:14:04 <hdaume> anyone ever run emacs-ispell on emacsnt?
08:14:10 <hdaume> (or i guess NTEmacs, it's called)
08:30:08 <Marvin--> I've bought beer, let's continue hacking!
08:31:08 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: pass me one
08:31:13 <SyntaxPolice> what kind of beer?
08:32:41 <Marvin--> Lundgren's lager (it's from a very small Swedish brewery, it's not exactly famous)
09:00:15 <h> hello
09:03:54 <Marvin--> tmoertel: do you have any changes you haven't checked in? I can't get it to work
09:04:33 * Heffalump is impressed that you can actually motivate yourselves to work on it now the deadline is past :-)
09:05:10 <Marvin--> it's a cool problem
09:05:17 <Heffalump> true
09:05:29 <Marvin--> and since it kinda sucks that we had to change strategy with six hours left, I want to get *something* to work
09:05:54 <Heffalump> I'd like to know if we can get our code to have comparable performance to the handcoded stuff with more tuning of the code and the path we feed it, but I don't have any time 
09:08:32 <Igloo> I think I know what we should have done now
09:09:48 <Igloo> Essentially our pre-bezierisation path should have been made by simple Dijkstra on large squares which takes into account the change in approximate curvature of the path. This would have been an awful lot faster and would have avoided the dodgy, long-running C
09:10:50 <Marvin--> how would you do that?
09:11:29 <Heffalump> how would Dijsktra take into account curvature?
09:12:01 <Igloo> If you look at the last 20 pixels you can get a rough idea of curvature. Then you just modify the path lengths to the next pixels accordingly
09:12:18 <Igloo> 20 might be wrong, but we could have tuned it
09:12:36 <Heffalump> that sounds broken to me, Dijsktra weights need to be path-independent
09:13:00 <kunphuzil> how is this function not destructive updating? it works, so it must not be.. succ n = n + 1
09:13:00 <Igloo> OK, so it's not quite Dijkstra
09:13:08 <Igloo> But it's pretty close
09:13:31 <Igloo> kunphuzil: It makes a new value leaving the old n where it is
09:13:38 <Marvin--> maybe you could do it with A*?
09:13:39 <Heffalump> I reckon doing Dijkstra without any weight changes, followed by walking along the paths compressing segments where endpoints are visible from each other into straight lines would be a good approach
09:13:54 <Igloo> So if you have let x = 5 in (succ x, x) you don't get (6, 6) you get (6, 5)
09:14:08 <hdaume> kunphuzil: it reads "the value 'succ n' is 'n+1'"...it's not saying "to run succ, set n to n+1"
09:14:22 <kunphuzil> oh, i see
09:14:22 <Igloo> Heff: You'd still have really tight corners then
09:14:24 <hdaume> kunphuzil: the equals is defining the function, not assigning a value
09:14:32 <kunphuzil> yeah, silly me :P
09:15:54 <Marvin--> Heffalump: I think we used Dijkstra to set up a rough distance field (on a per pixel basis)... we tried to use it for heuristics in A* but in the end we used it to calculate approximate gradients to travel with, but that approach doesn't work that well either, since, on e.g. 1_Simple it goes straight for the inner of the first curve, so the curve taking will suck
09:16:51 <Heffalump> oh, we did that too :-)
09:17:03 <Heffalump> is it better to go round the outside then? we weren't really sure
09:17:24 <Marvin--> well, you want to make as wide a turn as possible
09:17:30 <Heffalump> true.
09:17:36 <Heffalump> Oh, I think I see how we should have done it.
09:17:39 <Marvin--> so yes you want to be close to the inner of the curve in the middle, but far away when you enter the curve
09:17:53 <Heffalump> yeah.
09:18:03 <Marvin--> whereas our car went in a straight line from the starting point to the inner of the curve
09:18:16 <Marvin--> which makes sense on our premises, since that's where the gradient points
09:18:26 <Marvin--> obviously :) since we dont't take curvatures into account
09:18:45 <Heffalump> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/paths/1_Simple.png
09:18:50 * Igloo realises my GHC was using gcc 3.3 so that might have been the cause of some of my problems
09:18:55 <Heffalump> I think we should have curved round it better
09:19:13 <Marvin--> still better than ours
09:19:20 <Heffalump> right. Here's a plan for how we _should_ have done this contest: :-)
09:19:23 <hdaume> Igloo: color is proportional to velocity?
09:19:28 <Igloo> Yup
09:19:34 <Igloo> White means 25000 or higher
09:19:45 <Heffalump> Day 1: make a Bezier curve editor and a simulator
09:19:46 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/paths/ for all of them
09:19:48 <Heffalump> Day 2: Write the driver
09:19:59 <Heffalump> Day 3: Tweak the paths and driver for maximum performance
09:20:33 <Heffalump> I suspect we'd still have lost badly to the hand-crafted solutions, though
09:20:49 <hdaume> Igloo: those look quite good
09:21:08 <Igloo> hdaume: Some corners in pretty much every path suck
09:21:16 <Heffalump> our total was 164K or so, kosmikus said he could do 85K
09:21:18 <hdaume> true, but still pretty good
09:21:31 <Igloo> And there are also random tighter bits where it could be smoother
09:21:45 * Heffalump hopes we'll be reasonably high up on the entries that actually employed a reasonable degree of automation
09:21:55 <Igloo> We didn't have time to play with out tolerance function (how far we could stray) at all, which might have helped
09:22:35 <Igloo> Yeah - I think we expect to be a factor of 3 or more off the fastest entry overall
09:22:51 <Igloo> How did you do, hdaume?
09:24:07 <Heffalump> I think it'll be less than 3
09:24:48 <Igloo> Well we know it's > 2
09:25:30 <Heffalump> yes, but I suspect the best entry will be 65-70K
09:26:08 <Marvin--> okay, educate me, I don't know anything about bezier curves
09:27:02 <Riastradh> The Dylan team got 79682 total.
09:27:17 <Heffalump> oh, ok
09:27:24 <Marvin--> I haven't figured out how to fit a sequence of car commands to a curve
09:27:36 <Marvin--> can't claim I've thought *a lot* about it though
09:27:37 <Heffalump> Marvin--: easiest would be for me to show you our code
09:27:52 <Heffalump> I was going to put it online anyway
09:27:58 <Marvin--> works for me :)
09:28:40 <Igloo> Bezier curves basically allow you fit make a curve following a path piecewise that joins smoothly and also has smooth changes in rate of change of curvature
09:28:41 <hdaume> Igloo: normal work ended up getting the better of me, so i had to give up on saturday
09:28:51 <Igloo> Ah  :-(
09:29:13 <Igloo> That's the other problem with this problem - I think too many teams trying it properly will have failed to submit anything at all
09:29:33 <Marvin--> *cough* like us :-/
09:29:56 <Heffalump> our team could never have done it without being in the same physical location
09:30:31 <Marvin--> I guess communicating over irc slowed us down, but that wasn't the problem, the problem was that we worked on the wrong approach
09:30:44 <Heffalump> our approach really needed to be there in person
09:30:48 <Igloo> Well, I think I'd still have got the lightning entry out, but the trick there was to start pathologically slowly so you can literally go square to square and then turn it up until it wiggles into the walls
09:30:50 <Marvin--> oh?
09:31:21 <Heffalump> http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/areas/progtools/icfpcontest/2003/Driver.hs
09:31:34 <Heffalump> we spent a lot of time explaining stuff to each other on a whiteboard
09:31:46 <Heffalump> and showing each other how to use stuff at each other's computers
09:32:14 <vegai> was it possible to drive the car completely without a program?
09:32:21 <Heffalump> yep
09:32:23 <Marvin--> Heffalump: sounds sane, yeah
09:32:29 <vegai> ie. is it possible that some human wins the competition?
09:32:39 <Heffalump> yes, though in practice you really need a simulator
09:32:42 <vegai> fun =)
09:32:47 <Riastradh> vegai, possible, but not likely.
09:32:57 <Igloo> not likely?
09:33:02 * Riastradh toyed with the idea of just writing a little racing game with it.
09:33:13 <Heffalump> riastradh: how did your team do?
09:33:13 <Igloo> I'd say it was pretty likely if you allow a simulator to be used
09:33:43 <Riastradh> Heffalump, I dunno.  We finished making trace files of the tracks about a minute before the deadline, and them submitted the entry about ten seconds before the deadline.
09:33:47 <Heffalump> does the web based one report crashes at the exact point?
09:33:55 <vegai> ever heard of slicks'n'slides?
09:34:14 <Igloo> Yes
09:34:26 <vegai> wasn't the challenge somewhat similar 
09:34:33 <Igloo> (to Heff)
09:34:51 <vegai> or for oldies, super sprint
09:37:51 <Marvin--> hmm, looking at a page on bezier curves... so you'd try to pick good points along the turns and turn them into good curves?
09:39:00 <Igloo> Yup
09:39:15 <Marvin--> nifty
09:39:19 <Marvin--> "if only I had known..."
09:39:35 <Marvin--> well, the good thing about these kind of competitions is that you learn a lot :-)
09:39:37 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/SimpleDriver.hs and http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/Dijkstra.hs is our lightning entry
09:47:38 <mattam_> I know a team that made an editor for creating & optimizing the traces, apparently they got very good results, like 4000 on the car map (a perfect ovoid)
09:48:39 <Heffalump> yes, I think that's what we should have done, roughly
09:48:52 <Heffalump> well, certainly for the paths we fed our driver
09:49:26 <mattam> and it's more in the 'programming' spirit (vs only algorithms)
09:54:08 <Heffalump> true
09:56:26 <Igloo> We agree with http://tro.dyndns.org/icfp/viewtopic.php?t=18 except 189 not 981, which is encouraging
09:56:56 <Igloo> Although there were large gaps between them (14463, 18476, 24545)
09:59:48 <Igloo> Looks like 70k is the pace: http://tro.dyndns.org/icfp/viewtopic.php?t=20
10:00:09 <hdaume> yup
10:00:29 <hdaume> i got 50k on the first track...i wonder if it woul d have been possible to do <20k on the remaining 8 :)
10:00:37 <Igloo> :-)
10:01:10 <hdaume> (actually i think i had it down to 38k, but still major suckage)
10:01:19 <Heffalump> no, the pace is more than 77K.
10:01:36 * Igloo giggles at http://sed.free.fr/icfp2003/
10:01:45 <Igloo> I was only looking at the first digit
10:02:18 <Heffalump> http://www.sidoine.net/icfp/index.html is automatic and much better than us
10:02:55 <hdaume> i like the impossible universe map :)
10:04:00 <hdaume> Heffalump: that's more or less what i started to do, but didn't optimize well enough
10:18:13 <Heffalump> lol: "I don't know what happened, there must have been a bug in my code, it's too fast for me."
10:18:37 <hdaume> :)
10:20:31 <h> http://zolo.freelsd.net/~sts/ICFP03/log.html
10:28:17 <mvw> hi guys
10:29:05 <mvw> my guess was right, it was a problem from control theory, see the statement in the forum
10:29:30 <mvw> but i wonder how one should implement that in three days without having experience with it
10:29:52 <mvw> but it is good candidate for some lib_icfp :)
11:08:21 <Marvin--> yay, finally connectivity again
11:27:50 <Marvin--> http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ahudson/  now these are nice
11:57:08 <tmoertel> Marvin--: the look near optimal to my eye
11:57:54 <tmoertel> I'm not sure what the author was thinking when that "html" was created, however.
11:57:59 <tmoertel> I had to View Source to read it.
11:59:01 <Heffalump> :-)
11:59:05 <Heffalump> they are impressive
11:59:06 <Marvin--> good question
11:59:34 <Marvin--> he wiggles about a bit on track three though
12:02:23 <Igloo> They aren't actually optimal - the ends of all the laps could be improved
12:03:03 <Igloo> They do look very nice though
12:03:59 <Heffalump> improved how?
12:04:18 <Heffalump> oh, yeha
12:04:22 <Heffalump> s/yeha/yeah/
12:07:33 <tmoertel> "I used 17 Dual P4 1800Mhz computers. (Without the permission of the CS Dept... sorry guys no time to get permission..)"
12:07:59 <tmoertel> from the 77002 score holder
12:08:34 <tmoertel> oopps  make that the 77285 score holder (Hudson)
12:08:38 <Marvin--> ouch
12:35:12 <SnoopDoggy> Nobody tell seth_
12:57:20 <Igloo> Debugging this is a nightmare. ghc6 with one variant produces code that segfaults, ghci5 won't load the files
13:03:07 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: have you tried the magic ghc debugging flags?
13:03:14 <SyntaxPolice> lint something
13:26:54 <h> http://zolo.freelsd.net/~sts/ICFP03/Pictures/index.html
13:40:18 <SnoopDoggy> Happy Canada Day!
13:48:29 <h> http://zolo.freelsd.net/~sts/ICFP03/icfp03-3/ <-- this morning after submission
13:53:00 <Igloo> Right, I *think* this is fixed in GHC 6
13:53:25 <Igloo> But as it turns up randomly it's hard to be sure
14:02:17 <h> the source are available 
14:02:20 <h> http://zolo.freelsd.net/~sts/ICFP03/source.html
14:49:03 <tmoertel> shapr: check out the gradient plots for Een: http://icfp2003.moertel.com/gradient-plots
15:00:11 <h> next year i will do icfp using merd
15:00:23 <Riastradh> Merd?
15:01:22 <h> merd.net
15:01:31 <hdaume> tmoertel: cool
15:01:40 <vegai> h: is it made by the french?
15:02:31 <h> dunno 
15:02:32 <h> :)
15:02:44 <h> but its a funny name for french 
15:02:45 <h> :)
15:03:42 <vegai> aye =)
15:08:52 <shapr> tmoertel: that's nifty
15:09:29 <xkb> Is anything known yet about ICFP?
15:09:41 <shapr> yes, it happens at the end of august ;-)
15:09:46 <xkb> hehe
15:09:55 <xkb> I figured as much
16:39:02 <mattam> in the old draft off "Generalizing monads...", page 18, hughes says it's not possible to define app unless when we add the ArrowApply class, but i think i can write one app without that. Is it a known error or have I done something bizarre ?
16:40:29 <h> http://zolo.freelsd.net/~sts/ICFP03/trace/
16:40:53 <Igloo> I have no idea, but can't you write an arrow to test it with and not give an ArrowApply instance?
16:41:40 <mattam> that's what i've done and it works 
16:44:37 <Igloo> Is that code online somewhere?
16:45:47 <mattam> 2sec
16:47:35 <mattam> http://mattam.ath.cx/cvsview/devel/haskell/arrows/exprs.hs?rev=1.1
16:53:33 * Igloo doesn't know the syntax and semantics well enough to help, sorry
16:53:44 <mattam> :)
16:55:01 <Heffalump> where's the definition of app?
16:55:49 <Heffalump> obviously you can write app for specific arrows, and in particular for the arrow of pure functions it's easy - the thing you can't do is write a fully general ones in terms of the base arrow combinators
16:56:14 <mattam> ok
16:56:33 <mattam> what i've discovered also is that when matching a data constructor in a lambda (like \(Fun f) -> ...) it doesn't output errors like 'non-exhaustive match'
16:56:40 <mattam> so it is related
16:56:47 <Heffalump> related to what?
16:56:57 <mattam> to the fact that my app works
16:57:05 <Heffalump> what app?
16:57:13 <Heffalump> oh, that one
16:57:14 <mattam> cause i restrict it to A
16:57:30 <Heffalump> but it's for a specific arrow, and in fact the trivial arrow, as I said
16:57:45 <mattam> yes
16:58:02 <mattam> why doesn't it warn for non-exhaustiveness ?
16:58:06 <Heffalump> your arrow could be an instance of ArrowApply, you just need to define it
16:58:14 <hdaume> because the match is exhaustive
16:58:15 <Heffalump> no idea, what implementation? If ghc, are you using -Wall ?
16:58:37 <Heffalump> in what way is "\(Fun f) -> f" exhaustive on a datatype with more than one constructor?
16:58:52 <hdaume> Heffalump: it's not
16:58:57 <hdaume> but his DT has only one constructor
16:59:04 <Heffalump> data Val = Num Int | Bl Bool | Fun (EvalA Val Val)
16:59:10 <mattam> hdaume: no
16:59:31 <hdaume> oh...i assumed we were still talking about line: 		 where app = arr (\(A f,v) -> f v)
17:00:56 <hdaume> you guys are right...i't snot really exhaustive
17:01:11 <hdaume> but i think exhaustiveness is only checked on case/of matches
17:01:23 <ddarius> and function patterns
17:01:38 <Heffalump> I'd have thought the compiler could complain every time it has to generate match failure code
17:01:39 <hdaume> because (\ (Fun f) -> ...) is more of a let binding, i.e., more just naming than pattern maching
17:01:51 <Heffalump> s/could/would/
17:01:53 <hdaume> ddarius: yeah, i glommed that in to case/of
17:01:57 <Heffalump> but it's down to implementations
17:02:11 <mattam>  ghc and hugs do not warn
17:02:19 <Heffalump> what about ghc -Wall ?
17:02:29 <Heffalump> I don't remember hugs ever outputting warnings, since it's just an interpreter
17:02:53 <Igloo> It sort of makes sense - it's hard to say (\Just x -> x) without realising it but easy to miss a case out of case ... of ...
17:03:24 <ddarius> GHCi with -Wall complains about f [] = 4 but f x = \[] - 4 is fine.
17:03:36 <hdaume> ddarius: well they're very different
17:03:46 <hdaume> if the next line is "f (x:xs) = 5", ...
17:05:23 <hdaume> i think you can make arguments both ways...i tend to agree with Igloo though
17:06:25 <ddarius> I agree with Igloo too, I don't usually match sum-types in lambda's (unless I'm sure or prefer the error)
17:06:59 <mattam> nice to know it, i wasn't warned about that :)
17:07:32 * Heffalump agrees with ddarius etc, but would expect -Wall to complain
17:07:57 <Heffalump> presumably it gets compiled to a case?
17:08:07 <hdaume> i think if Wall complained, you would get tons of warning about it
17:08:12 <mattam> -Wall complains in ghc
17:08:23 <hdaume> oh.  then we're all set :)
17:08:40 <Heffalump> s/compiled/desugared/
17:09:41 <hdaume> Heffalump: yeah i think so
17:16:12 <ddarius> google groups needs to update faster
17:21:05 * Pseudonym yawns
17:49:01 <h> you hugs a lot guy 
17:49:15 <h> is it a gay chan ? :))
18:43:21 <Pseudonym> Oh, we all like hugs here.
18:44:56 <ddarius> I prefer GHCi.
18:45:07 <Pseudonym> Me too, but I still like hugs.
18:45:52 <Igloo> They're both good, but I'd rather have a Haskell 98 implementation
18:45:59 <Igloo> Or better still Haskell 2  :-)
18:46:15 <Pseudonym> What does hugs not support in the way of H98?
18:46:24 <Igloo> unicode at least
18:46:27 <Pseudonym> True.
18:46:36 <Pseudonym> I think that's close to all, though.
18:46:46 * Igloo can't think of anything else OTTOMH
18:46:47 <Riastradh> Igloo, how about we figure out what Haskell 2 is, first?
18:46:48 <Pseudonym> GHC doesn't support recursive module imports.
18:47:01 <Pseudonym> Without some extra-language guff.
18:47:06 <ddarius> Hugs does?
18:47:19 <Pseudonym> Sure.
18:47:24 <Igloo> Riastradh: Yeah, that's one of the issues  :-)
18:47:26 <Pseudonym> It loads all the modules into memory. :-)
18:47:54 <ddarius> Yeah, I figure it would be easier with an interpreter.
18:48:27 <Igloo> It'd be fine with a program compiler too
18:48:33 <Igloo> It's module compiling it gets tricky with
18:51:12 <Pseudonym> I think this is actually a fault in the H98 specification, which is why I don't want a H98 implementation. :-)
18:51:59 <Igloo> I'm annoyed by it often enough I don't think I'm 100% convinced
18:52:56 <Pseudonym> There are two things I don't like in H98's module system.
18:53:06 <Pseudonym> One is the syntax which allows automatic exporting of all symbols.
18:53:28 <Pseudonym> If it doesn't have an interface, it's not a module.
18:53:46 <Pseudonym> The other is that it allows symbols to be exported which do not have their type declared.
18:53:49 <Igloo> I'd agree with that if ghci would implicitly export everything for me
18:54:07 <Igloo> Which I think it might do iff interpreting
18:54:10 <Pseudonym> Which means that you can't tell what a module's interface is, in general, without intermodule analysis.
18:54:15 <Pseudonym> Igloo: Yes, I agree.
18:54:26 <Igloo> So maybe I really just need to find out how to force it to interpret
18:54:26 <Pseudonym> Exporting all symbols in an interpreter is fair game, IMO.
19:03:02 <Heffalump> I prefer ghci to hugs now, but I forget why.
19:03:14 <Heffalump> Oh yes, the monadic-like syntax for in-command loop definitions
19:03:30 <Heffalump> and with a fast machine the difference in load times is less :-)
19:03:48 <Pseudonym> I like it that you can have some of your code compiled and some interpreted.
19:03:59 <Pseudonym> Only interpret that which needs to be run by hand.
19:04:05 <Heffalump> the behaviour isn't entirely consistent between those modes, though
19:04:24 <Pseudonym> Oh, I didn't know that.
19:04:26 <Pseudonym> Got an example?
19:04:30 <Heffalump> with compiled modules only exported stuff is visible
19:04:33 <Pseudonym> Yes.
19:04:36 <Heffalump> whereas everything is with interpreted modules
19:04:39 <Pseudonym> Well I knew that. :-)
19:04:50 <Heffalump> it tends to be quite irritating when debugging a module
19:04:52 <Pseudonym> I thought you meant semantics or something.
19:04:57 <Heffalump> oh, no :-)
19:05:09 <Pseudonym> Oh, another thing I don't like is that if there's a .o file, it uses that in preference to the .hs file.
19:05:21 <Heffalump> doesn't it do up-to-date-ness checks?
19:05:23 <Pseudonym> You have to delete the object file before you can interpret a module.
19:05:27 <Pseudonym> Oh, it might.
19:05:35 <Pseudonym> Good idea.  "touch" is my friend.
19:05:37 <Heffalump> I don't remember having to do make clean before editing code
19:05:55 <Heffalump> why would you want to interpret a module, apart from the exported symbols thing?
