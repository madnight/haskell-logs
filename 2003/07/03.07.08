00:00:00 <inkedmn> whether it's 5 minutes or 60
00:00:02 <alanl> but make it clear you get the money for the time your phone is on, regardless of the fact anyone calls
00:00:07 <Pseudonym> Calls are rounded up to the next hour.
00:00:13 <Pseudonym> If you come in, it's at least three hours.
00:00:27 <Pseudonym> alanl: That's a given.
00:00:34 <inkedmn> so you want to get paid for the time you have the phone but aren't using it for work?
00:00:44 <Pseudonym> Yes.
00:00:59 <Pseudonym> I want to get paid for the inconvenience of having my weekend disrupted.
00:00:59 <alanl> and thats how it works in the other professions as well
00:01:21 <inkedmn> but a phone that isn't ringing isn't disrupting anything
00:01:27 <Pseudonym> Yes it is.
00:01:34 <inkedmn> and when it does ring, you're guaranteed double your hourly rate
00:01:35 <Rafterman> it is if you can't go out and get drunk because of it
00:01:36 <inkedmn> how?
00:01:42 <alanl> having a phone on your essentially means you can't go anywhere
00:01:49 <Pseudonym> If I have to be able to come into work within an hour, that means I can't go places.
00:01:53 <inkedmn> oh, i see
00:02:35 <Pseudonym> One of the guys here, for example, plays and umpires baseball every Saturday.
00:02:36 <alanl> or get drunk....or other more exciting activities where you can't get disrupted, if you get my drift
00:02:43 <Pseudonym> He effectively can't play for the weekend he's on.
00:03:07 <inkedmn> i wouldn't accept that as part of my job then
00:03:19 <Pseudonym> You would if the price was right. :-)
00:03:36 <inkedmn> the only way i'd consider it would be if my job was at stake
00:03:46 <inkedmn> short of that, i'd refuse
00:04:06 <Pseudonym> Well the other thing is that we expect that the phone will ring possibly once every two years.
00:04:14 <alanl> I'm also assuming you're in a position to bargain with your employers
00:04:22 <Pseudonym> Oh, I definitely am.
00:04:28 <Pseudonym> I mentioned my contract earlier. :-)
00:04:30 <inkedmn> Pseudonym: are you the only person who'd have a phone?
00:04:38 <Pseudonym> inkedmn: No, there'd be a roster.
00:04:43 <inkedmn> meaning, if i called the "support line" and you'... ok
00:04:51 <Pseudonym> And you'd know in advance which weekends you were doing it.
00:04:58 <Pseudonym> Well in advance.  I made that very clear.
00:05:12 <inkedmn> and would it be literally, 24-hours a day?
00:05:24 <Pseudonym> Well, at first it would be 8x7.
00:05:38 <Pseudonym> We're actually looking at how much for 8x7, 16x7 and 24x7.
00:05:38 <inkedmn> 8x7?
00:05:42 <inkedmn> oh
00:05:44 <inkedmn> got it
00:06:01 <inkedmn> if you know what hours you'd need to be on call, that'd be different
00:06:24 <Pseudonym> The "support line" is actually only for one customer, incidentally, and only for critical problems.  As I mentioned, we don't expect the phone to ring too often.
00:06:54 <Pseudonym> One other thing that I don't like is I don't get paid for the time in transit to and from work.
00:06:58 <inkedmn> then take as much as they'll give you
00:07:00 <Pseudonym> I live an hour away from work.
00:07:17 <inkedmn> my last job was over an hour away from home
00:07:20 <Pseudonym> That's two hours out of my life that I don't get paid for.
00:07:24 <Pseudonym> If I'm called in.
00:07:25 <alanl> well stand your ground if you are in a position
00:07:30 <alanl> to do so
00:07:31 <Pseudonym> Oh, we are.
00:07:44 <Pseudonym> Nobody here liked it.
00:07:54 <alanl> because it will be a slippery slope if you let something like that to happen
00:08:02 <inkedmn> can you not work remotely? (i'm assuming this is a technical job)
00:08:26 <Pseudonym> inkedmn: Yes and no.
00:08:40 <Pseudonym> Some problems can be sorted out remotely, some can't.
00:08:49 <inkedmn> ok
00:09:24 * earthy checks his contract
00:09:33 * inkedmn would like a job
00:10:16 <earthy> pseudonym: if your boss asks you to carry a phone and be at work within an hour after calling you're on standby
00:10:27 <inkedmn> if the chances of the phone NEVER ringing are pretty damn good, then take as much as they'll give you
00:10:30 <earthy> I'm just checking the going rates for standby
00:10:36 <inkedmn> and deal with the occasional inconvenience
00:11:22 <alanl> and also make sure their policy on public holidays that fall on weekends are
00:11:44 <alanl> you'd hate to have to go on xmas holiday or something like that
00:11:54 <earthy> going in to work *ofcourse* counts as overtime
00:13:02 <earthy> inkedmn: there's certain weekends that you *don't* want a call... such as e.g. the weekend closest to a wedding anniversary
00:13:02 <inkedmn> well, arrange ahead of time to NOT have the phone then
00:13:07 <inkedmn> he said there's a roster, which rotates i'm sure
00:13:32 <inkedmn> i'm sure that can be arranged, given the infrequency of these calls
00:13:58 <earthy> exactly.
00:14:06 <earthy> let's see, chapter 9, IIRC
00:19:05 <alanl> has anyone checked out ghc6 here?
00:19:12 <inkedmn> nosuh
00:19:52 <alanl> for example, what is a PackedString?
00:19:52 <earthy> checked it out as far as trying to get it to compile on Solaris
00:20:25 <earthy> alanl: I'd *guess* it's simply a String that needs conversionfunctions to get to [Char]
00:20:37 <Pseudonym> My contract says at the moment that I work 36 hours a week and that's it.
00:20:37 <Pseudonym> So I'm definitely in a position of power.
00:20:37 <Pseudonym> earthy: Yes.
00:20:37 <Pseudonym> My question is: How much of your normal hourly rate do you expect for being on standby?
00:20:37 <Pseudonym> alanl: Since you understand Australian dollars, I'll give you some figures. :-)
00:20:39 <Pseudonym> They're looking at A$250 (before tax) for the 16 hours of the weekend.
00:20:41 <Pseudonym> And it would happen every 4-6 weeks.
00:20:43 * Pseudonym isn't very enthused by this amount of money
00:20:45 <Pseudonym> Nor was anyone else in the meeting we just had.
00:20:47 <Pseudonym> For 16x7, it would be $950 for the week, which is more like it.
00:20:49 <Pseudonym> Now that's more hours, but it's about three times the money for about twice the hassle.
00:20:51 <Pseudonym> Well, the specific weekend is not a problem, because you know well in advance which weekend it'll be and you can pick-and-choose.
00:20:54 <Pseudonym> And you get paid by the hour.
00:20:56 <Pseudonym> That is, by the hour that isn't a normal work hour.
00:21:13 <Pseudonym> Anyway.
00:21:20 <Pseudonym> Oh, PackedString goes way back.
00:21:29 <Marvin--> ello
00:21:39 <Pseudonym> Yes, it's like a String except it needs to be converted to and from a [Char].
00:22:04 <alanl> is PackedString way faster then string?
00:22:09 * Marvin-- wonders if he's calm enough to reply to the moronic installation report
00:22:18 <Pseudonym> Well it's smaller, and less fragmented.
00:22:38 <Pseudonym> It's probably slower if you're doing the task of scanning it from front to back.
00:22:39 <earthy> pseudonym: they're paying 5.15% on weekdays between 06:00 and 22:00, 3.09% on other hours of weekdays, 7.21% on saturdays between 06:00 and 22:00 and 5.15% on other hours on saturdays and 8.24% between 06:00 and 22:00 on sundays and holidays and 6.18% on other hours on sundays and holidays
00:23:00 <Pseudonym> That's as a proportion of normal hourly rate?
00:23:12 <Marvin--> mapPS looks nifty
00:23:42 <earthy> pseudonym: yes. *and* the resulting amounts are increased by 25% if you need to stay within a certain distance from a certain location
00:24:04 <Pseudonym> So that's 7.21% + 25%?
00:24:12 <earthy> 7.21% * 1.25, yes.
00:24:17 <Pseudonym> Oh.
00:24:21 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
00:24:51 <earthy> owh, this only holds if you earn less than roughly EUR 3000 a month, gross.
00:25:05 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
00:25:13 <Pseudonym> I don't know how much I earn in Euros.
00:25:17 * Marvin-- makes way less than EUR 3000 per month
00:25:28 * earthy makes about EUR 1500 a month gross.
00:25:47 <Marvin--> I don't know what the current exchange rate is, I think I'm somewhere around 1700
00:26:07 <earthy> and at my consluting job I made about EUR 2300 gross
00:26:12 <alanl> well I guess 250 for standby is barely okay, but hell if I were you i'd expect a huge payment for actually turning to work....esp if its at night
00:26:30 <Pseudonym> I make less than EUR 3000, OK.
00:26:38 <Pseudonym> Oh, definitely.
00:26:39 <earthy> owh, turning up to work counts as overtime, obviously.
00:26:44 * Pseudonym nods
00:27:07 <Pseudonym> The problem is that most of us have lives.
00:27:19 <Pseudonym> If you don't have a life, you care less that it's restricted.
00:27:20 <Marvin--> speak for yourself! ;)
00:27:23 <alanl> and you'd want a minimum payment of 5 hours or soif you do have to turn up
00:27:24 <earthy> Pseudonym: yes. 
00:27:43 <Pseudonym> Well the suggestion is a minimum of 3 hours if you have to turn up.
00:27:47 <earthy> but that's what the standby-pay is supposed to cover.
00:27:53 <earthy> pseudonym: which is fair
00:27:59 <Pseudonym> Trouble is it takes me an hour to get to work and an hour back again.
00:28:03 <Pseudonym> Which I _wouldn't_ get paid for.
00:28:12 <Pseudonym> (Except the normal standby rate.)
00:28:24 <alanl> therefore a minimum of 5 hours is reasonable
00:29:02 <earthy> pseudonym: the time you need to travel to work on standby time counts as overtime
00:29:06 <earthy> :)
00:29:16 <Pseudonym> I'll mention that to them. :-)
00:29:20 <Marvin--> yeah that's pretty normal, isn't it?
00:29:33 <Pseudonym> I would have hoped so, but apparently not.
00:29:41 <earthy> marvin--: here it is. `you want me to show up, you pay me to do so'
00:29:54 <Marvin--> of course, I'm pretty happy that I've got 15 minutes by bike to work :-)
00:30:07 * earthy takes about 1h20m
00:30:10 <Pseudonym> Yes.  Well there's one person here who's literally 5 mins walk.
00:30:26 <Pseudonym> He could take the long way, I suppose. :-)
00:30:33 <earthy> but that's doable for a PhD studentship. :)
00:31:28 <Pseudonym> Anyway, we all said we weren't enthused.
00:31:46 <Marvin--> heh, 1h20m, that's pretty much what it takes for the train to go from Göteborg to the town where my parents live
00:31:48 <earthy> pseudonym: point is, your boss can't *make* you take that phone.
00:31:48 <Pseudonym> Part of the problem is that there are only six people who are actually qualified to do it.
00:31:53 <Pseudonym> I know. 
00:31:54 <Pseudonym> :-)
00:32:08 <Pseudonym> And the actual purpose of this is not because my boss wants to be a bastard.
00:32:20 <Pseudonym> It's that a customer wants this, and we're working out how much to charge _them_.
00:32:27 <earthy> marvin--: of that 1h20m 50 minutes are train. :)
00:32:32 <alanl> then its doubley safe for you to stand your ground then!
00:32:38 <Pseudonym> Right.
00:32:49 <Pseudonym> OTOH, this is a big customer.  We don't want to lose them.
00:33:00 <earthy> pseudonym: owh, I've played this game before... :) we won the customer, btw.
00:33:02 <alanl> well do you get stock options?
00:33:06 <Marvin--> earthy: the actual train between Göteborg and Skövde is 1h-1h5m, I counted the rest as time to get to the station :-P
00:33:08 <Pseudonym> No. :-)
00:33:11 <Pseudonym> That's the amusing part.
00:33:15 <earthy> marvin--: :)
00:33:17 <Pseudonym> THis is a _university_.
00:33:22 <alanl> oops
00:33:25 <earthy> pseudonym: *so*? :)
00:33:35 <Pseudonym> Believe me, you don't want stocks in this university.
00:33:36 <alanl> well we're in australia...
00:33:38 <earthy> the rates I quoted are university rates as well. ;)
00:34:02 <alanl> and universities here are not supposed to be corporations, unlike in SOME places
00:34:14 <earthy> (the dutch supercomputing facility is nominally still under university control, but does contract out as well)
00:34:30 <Pseudonym> Well we're actually a research project who is going to be spun off into a company RSN.
00:35:00 <earthy> pseudonym: and none of you have enough market experience to know the going rates?
00:35:01 <Marvin--> are there any unicode codecs for Haskell?
00:35:03 <earthy> *ouch*
00:35:12 <Pseudonym> Nope.
00:35:17 <Marvin--> Like, a Char is supposed to be a unicode character, how do I convert a string to a utf-8 representation?
00:35:26 <Pseudonym> That's partly why I'm asking here. :-)
00:35:49 <earthy> pseudonym: well, the rates I quoted are pretty standard in .nl
00:35:57 <earthy> slightly on the low side, even.
00:36:06 * Pseudonym nods
00:36:14 <Pseudonym> Thanks.  It was useful.
00:36:26 <earthy> but that's not what you should be charging. ;)
00:36:47 <Pseudonym> Definitely. :-)
00:36:56 * alanl faints at all the new library functions in GHC 6
00:37:12 <Pseudonym> Personally, I think if we have to come into work and deal with a customer, we should get consulting rates, not salary rates.
00:37:17 * earthy wakes up alanl
00:37:27 <Marvin--> Pseudonym: definitely
00:37:30 <earthy> pseudonym: wrong.
00:37:34 <Pseudonym> I know. :-)
00:37:51 <earthy> if you want consulting rates, don't count on a salary coming in every month. :)
00:38:03 <Pseudonym> Double time (and double time and a half for public holidays) is okay for actually doing work.
00:38:10 <earthy> exactly.
00:38:11 <Pseudonym> Except I want to be paid for transit.
00:38:22 <alanl> do you get leave loading in victoria btw?
00:38:24 <earthy> ask for normal hourly rate for transit.
00:38:27 <Pseudonym> Yes.
00:38:43 <earthy> it's only fair, as you wouldn't be in that transit were it not for work
00:38:47 * Pseudonym nods
00:38:48 <earthy> *and* it can be directly billed. ;)
00:39:17 <alanl> unless of course you can negotiate to get a slice of the action when this thing gets spun off
00:39:43 <earthy> that... could be both nice and dangerous. ;)
00:39:46 <Pseudonym> Well, it looks like we are getting that, but this isn't the point.
00:40:03 <Pseudonym> The point is, I don't think the offer for being "on standby" was enough.
00:40:18 <earthy> it wasn't. A$250 is what? 150 euro's?
00:40:29 <earthy> for an *entire* weekend?
00:40:39 <Pseudonym> 9-5 on both weekend days.
00:40:57 <Pseudonym> And that's before tax, of course.
00:41:14 <Pseudonym> The tax man takes 30-50% depending on your tax bracket.
00:41:24 <alanl> this would really suck if this bumps you up to the next tax bracket
00:41:29 <Pseudonym> Yes it would.
00:41:44 <Pseudonym> I don't think it will.  I'm a single-income family with dependent spouse and children.
00:41:45 <alanl> can you negotiate fringe benefits
00:41:46 <alanl> ?
00:41:49 <Pseudonym> Income splitting is good.
00:42:03 <Pseudonym> But it will bump some of the single people up into the next bracket, I think.
00:42:16 * earthy ponders
00:42:33 <Pseudonym> alanl: What fringe benefits?
00:42:42 <Pseudonym> That we get to play with a sparc laptop all weekend?
00:42:42 <earthy> okay, it's only 9-5, and it's only that standby time. then it's reasonable.
00:43:22 <alanl> no...like a company car, overseas "conferences", bigger super contribution, IT toys slush fund, stuff like that
00:43:24 <earthy> still, I'd settle with AUD 175 and full pay for transit. ;)
00:43:28 <Marvin--> eh? the different tax rates are calculated on the full income, not on the size of income above the limits??
00:44:15 <Pseudonym> Well I'm not going to settle for that, personally.
00:44:15 <alanl> yes..but if you're at the edge of one bracket and the pay increase bumps you into a higher tax bracket, it basically removes the point of the pay rise
00:44:17 <Rafterman> Marvin--: I always thought it was the latter
00:44:24 <Pseudonym> I signed on for a 9-5 job.
00:44:33 <earthy> marvin--: probably not, but he gets to use his spouse's limits as well. :)
00:44:59 <Pseudonym> If this was a condition of employment _when_ I started working here, that'd be different.
00:45:16 <earthy> pseudonym: the pay they offer is reasonable, afaict, but you don't need to do it. that's always your choice. :)
00:45:28 <Pseudonym> Yeah. :-)
00:45:32 <Pseudonym> That's the good part.
00:45:55 <Pseudonym> It's effectively a change to everyone's working conditions, and they won't sack us if we refuse.
00:46:02 <Pseudonym> So we can aim high.
00:46:08 <earthy> they can't even, normally. ;)
00:46:33 <earthy> oh well, time for a next go at compiling ghc6
00:47:04 <Pseudonym> Thanks, anyway, everyone, you've answered my question that what they offered is within the bounds of market value.
00:47:26 <earthy> apparently they're not stupid. :)
00:47:31 <earthy> (good thing, that)
00:47:34 <Pseudonym> Yes.
00:47:41 * Marvin-- is glad he doesn't have to worry about things like "market value" yet
00:47:50 <Pseudonym> And as I said, it's not me vs my employer, it's my employer vs the customer.
00:48:07 <Rafterman> http://www.ato.gov.au/content.asp?doc=/content/Individuals/12333.htm <-- going up a tax bracket can't make you earn less
00:48:07 * earthy is glad he won't have to worry about things like 'market value' any more for the next 4 years or so. ;)
00:48:27 <Marvin--> earthy: because?
00:48:36 <Marvin--> Rafterman: it'd be very scary if it di
00:48:37 <Marvin--> d
00:49:03 <earthy> rafterman: in .nl it can, because of social healthcare and suddenly having to pay your own full healthcare insurance...
00:49:16 * alanl nods
00:49:20 <Pseudonym> Hang on, anotehr meeting. :-)
00:49:36 <earthy> marvin--: I've got a 4-year paid PhD studentship at Utrecht U. :)
00:49:52 <Marvin--> technically, since I'm working "in the industry" during summers, I guess I *should* worry about it, but seeing as I haven't even graduated yet, it's hard to argue getting a raise
00:49:55 <Marvin--> earthy: ah, nice
00:50:07 <Marvin--> earthy: I hope to get one of those next year
00:50:15 <earthy> Utrecht U as well? >:)
00:50:19 <Marvin--> well, no...
00:50:37 <earthy> paid and at a uni, 'kay. :) what subject?
00:50:48 <alanl> what the hell are arrows btw?
00:50:49 <Marvin--> I'm mainly interested in doing it here at Chalmers, but other places that are into functional programming would be interesting too
00:50:52 <Rafterman> earthy: ok, other costs might be influenced, but the straight income tax part can't bite you in the ass
00:50:58 <earthy> true.
00:51:10 <Marvin--> I was hoping to have one for this fall, but the competition for the positions was too hard
00:51:29 <earthy> pity
00:52:21 <Marvin--> kinda hard even for the people that I know at the institution to argue that I should have one of the positions when there was many applicants who already had scientific articles published and stuff...
00:52:54 <Marvin--> (though apparently I had more friends arguing my case than I expected, which is nice :-P)
00:53:32 <earthy> ;)
00:55:29 <Pseudonym> OK, that's more like it.
00:55:49 <Pseudonym> The numbers being thrown around now is A$500 for the weekend, and quadruple time for coming in.
00:56:03 <alanl> nice
00:56:07 <Pseudonym> Very nice.
00:56:12 <Pseudonym> That's 500 before tax of course.
00:56:14 <Pseudonym> But still.
00:56:21 * Pseudonym would go for that
00:56:25 <earthy> ;)
00:56:42 <alanl> does anyone know what arrows are?
00:56:48 <ddarius> alanl: www.haskell.org/arrows and www.haskell.org/yampa
00:57:40 * alanl frowns at the extra stuff to add on to the piles of books/papers to read
00:57:59 <Pseudonym> alanl: Basically, you know how monads encode sequential kinds of operations?
00:58:07 <Pseudonym> Do this, then do this, then do this, and propagate stuff along.
00:58:14 <alanl> kinda, yes
00:58:57 <Pseudonym> Well, arrows encode more general operations.
00:59:03 <Pseudonym> Like graphs with cycles.
00:59:14 <Marvin--> the way I see it is that a monad is an "action" with a result, whereas an arrows is a "computation" with an input and an output
00:59:27 <Marvin--> er, "an arrow" of course
01:00:25 <alanl> has anyone done most of the exercises on TAOCP?
01:00:47 <Pseudonym> Gotta go home.
01:00:49 <Pseudonym> Night everyone.
01:01:03 <alanl> nite
01:01:15 * Marvin-- sighs at the NM flamewar on debian-doc
01:01:27 <Pseudonym> Thanks to everyone for your advice.
01:01:27 <alanl> NM?
01:01:28 <Pseudonym> Night.
01:02:47 <earthy> alanl: EXPN `most of the exercises on TAOCP'?
01:02:56 <Marvin--> alanl: new maintainer
01:03:31 <alanl> <30 or so on knuth's scales?
01:03:39 <Marvin--> some people seem to have a hard time understanding why Debian demands that people who get root access to all the Debian installations in the world have to be competent
01:04:06 <earthy> and then all of them, in all chapters in all 3 books and the preliminary facsimiles for book 4?
01:04:12 <earthy> I seriously doubt it. :)
01:04:18 <earthy> (I've tried my hand at a few though)
01:05:01 <alanl> or anyone who actually understands how MIX works
01:05:16 <earthy> MIX isn't hard. but you want to be looking at MMIX
01:07:21 <earthy> (note, MIX *is* crufty and ugly... ;))
01:10:02 <earthy> (self modifying code as *prerequisite* for the calling convention... *sheesh*)
01:12:36 <alanl> thats part of the reason why I'm interested in MIX...interested in the whole notion of self modifying code
01:20:49 * earthy gives alanl a big bucket of liquid soap
01:20:52 <earthy> go rinse thy mouth!
01:22:02 <earthy> but, well, the idea is *really* simple, actually.
01:22:21 <earthy> the calling convention is as follows: you set up a stack with arguments
01:22:51 <earthy> (owh, this is all from memory and may be false, my TAOCP is 80km from here)
01:23:42 <earthy> then, you write the program counter to the first memory word of the routine you're calling.
01:23:54 <earthy> then you call the routine at start_of_routine + 1.
01:24:14 <earthy> that `call' is a simple jump
01:24:48 <earthy> then, at the end of that routine, there is a jump to the address at start_of_routine
01:25:12 <earthy> (this wreaks havoc with recursion, *yes*)
02:28:36 * Marvin-- ponders what happened to the comonad discussion
02:29:51 * andersca ponders why he read that as lemonade discussion
02:29:58 <Marvin--> you're thirsty

03:18:13 <earthy> morning kosmikus
03:18:21 <kosmikus> morning
03:30:38 <xkb> Does anyone here know how to set a path to a program in Mac OSX?
03:30:44 <xkb> For use with Helium
03:31:35 <kosmikus> it's not clear to me what you want to do
03:31:57 <xkb> In Helium you have the option to "bind" an editor to the graphical interpreter
03:32:13 <xkb> to do that you need to set the path to the application that serves as editor
03:32:13 <kosmikus> in hint you have, yes
03:32:20 <kosmikus> yes
03:32:48 <xkb> however in Os X you have "packages" wherein there is an executable
03:33:02 <xkb> and the Finder knows this and starts the program at double click
03:33:09 <earthy> xkb: such a package can be started from the Terminal commandline as well
03:33:14 <xkb> ah
03:33:24 <earthy> and there you can set environment variables.
03:33:26 <kosmikus> yes, you should find out where the program resides
03:33:27 <xkb> by typing the name? like in linux
03:33:30 <kosmikus> yes
03:33:34 <earthy> exactly.
03:34:12 <earthy> (if you want to simulate double-click behaviour in finder on the Terminal commandline type    open /full/path/to/filename   )
03:34:27 <xkb> hmm so I can set this: /Applications/vim/Vim.app as path?
03:35:43 <earthy> ah, yes, I just checked the configurationhints for helium.
03:35:47 <earthy> Yes, that ought to work.
03:36:12 <xkb> %f is filename en %r linenr?
03:36:27 <earthy> %f is expanded to the file name, %r to the row (line number), %c to the column)
03:36:31 <earthy> from the docs
03:36:49 <xkb> hmm.. how would vim jump to the line.. Ah well.. man vim
03:36:56 <earthy> so, /Applications/vim/Vim.app +%r %f   should do the trick
03:37:16 <earthy> (can't test as the iBook is in need of repair)
03:37:37 <xkb> hmm.. Vim.app: cannot execute
03:39:47 <xkb> and the path to the "real" executable doesnt start the gui
03:40:18 <xkb> ah -g
03:40:53 <phubuh> do you have "open /path/Vim.app" or just the path?
03:41:01 <xkb> just the path
03:41:09 <phubuh> try it with open
03:41:13 <xkb> k
03:41:47 <xkb> works better
03:42:00 <xkb> doesnt get the file passed though
03:42:04 <xkb> (yet)
04:12:18 <earthy> hmmm. odd
04:12:57 <earthy> but, then yould have to specify it with   open -a /path/Vim.app %f
04:13:09 <earthy> s/yould/you would/
04:15:14 <xkb> hmm
04:15:19 <xkb> Ill try that again
04:30:13 <xkb> earthy : not much luck using that line
05:10:12 <Marvin--> ello dark
05:10:32 <dark> greetingses
05:40:37 <earthy> xkb: hm.
05:40:56 <earthy> well, as I said... the iBook needs repair, so I can't check... I'm wildly guessing
07:03:20 <thornber> is there a standard function to randomly shuffle a list ?
07:04:35 <Heffalump> I'm fairly sure not
07:04:42 <Heffalump> but don't quote me on that :-)
07:05:12 <Marvin--> I'd be surprised if there was a standard function for that
07:05:21 <thornber> y
07:05:43 <thornber> I feel I should be able to do it with a fold and reverse
07:05:54 <Heffalump> I don't think it's that easy.
07:06:10 <Marvin--> a) it's not typical to do that with lists, b) it'd have to be in IO, or thread around a random number seed
07:06:12 <Heffalump> the actual algorithms required are surprisingly fiddly to get a properly random result
07:06:49 <Marvin--> also, it depends on what you actually want to achieve!
07:07:08 <thornber> perfect randomness is not necc.
07:07:13 <shapr> I'd use System.Random to choose from all of the non-chosen items of the list
07:07:23 <thornber> k
07:07:31 <Marvin--> you won't *get* perfect randomness without an RRNG :-)
07:07:46 <thornber> :P
07:07:47 <Heffalump> I just mean properly random even if you have a good RNG.
07:08:06 <Heffalump> you either need to generate a random permutation, or do fiddly things with swaps
07:08:11 <Marvin--> as I said, it depends on what you want to achieve - in terms of distribution and functionality
07:08:38 <shapr> I wrote a function that picks a random item from a list
07:08:39 <thornber> I could explode the list to a binary tree, then randomly walk the tree building up a new list ?
07:08:56 <thornber> shapr: do you have it handy ?
07:09:04 <shapr> sure
07:09:21 <thornber> thornber at sistina.com
07:09:38 <shapr> not sestina?
07:09:44 <shapr> :-)
07:10:10 <thornber> :) I didn't choose the company name
07:10:49 <Heffalump> why sestina?
07:10:50 <shapr> thornber: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot/QuoteModule/Fortune.hs?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
07:11:01 <shapr> Heffalump: it's a flavor of poem
07:11:08 <shapr> @all-dicts sistina
07:11:10 <lambdabot> No match for "sistina".
07:11:21 <Marvin--> "Infinitely Smarter Storage" wow, now *that's* impressive
07:11:22 <shapr> I don't know the word 'sistina' though
07:11:47 <shapr> hi steveh 
07:11:50 <Heffalump> well, if your storage isn't smart at all to begin with
07:11:55 <Heffalump> then infinitely smarter could still be 0
07:11:55 <steveh> Hello #haskellers
07:11:58 <steveh> how's it going?
07:12:03 <shapr> code is good
07:12:07 <Marvin--> Heffalump: true
07:12:17 <shapr> thornber: you see the getRandItem at the top of Fortune.hs ?
07:12:29 <thornber> y, just reading it, thx
07:13:23 <Marvin--> "enterprise and technical computing customers"
07:13:27 * Marvin-- groans
07:13:53 <shapr> like, NCC-1701D ?
07:14:07 <Marvin--> I wonder if there are *any* corporate sites about something remotely computer-related that do not contain the word "enterprise" on their start page
07:14:42 <Heffalump> they do do cool stuff, though.
07:14:44 <thornber> website is nothing to do with me, they just pay me
07:14:44 <shapr> galois connections?
07:14:51 <Heffalump> in particular LVM, which they give away
07:14:59 <Marvin--> shapr: I'll have you know that CAPS is a "Real-Time Enterprise Computing platform"
07:15:13 <Marvin--> Heffalump: sure
07:16:00 <Marvin--> I've long since come to the conclusion that corporate websites have nothing to do with information, they're just a happy little world for marketing people to use their own secret language on
07:17:02 <shapr> I agree.
07:17:16 <steveh> sometimes the tech support sections are decent
07:17:28 <thornber> possibly because web monkeys and marketing people don't understand the techies
07:21:42 * Marvin-- pukes over the Strakt homepage again
07:25:17 <earthy> marvin--: yes, there *is* a corporate site about something remotely computer-related that does not contain the word "enterprise" on the start page.
07:25:33 <earthy> http://www.apple.com/
07:25:39 <Marvin--> cool :-)
07:26:14 <earthy> and ghc runs on MacOS X without a hitch. :)
07:26:29 <Marvin--> http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3054210.stm  "Hi-tech babble baffles many"
07:27:02 <Marvin--> I would rather say that any kind of professional lingo baffles many
07:27:11 <Marvin--> I, for one, don't understand marketers
07:44:41 <earthy> well, it takes a while to get used to the easy bandying about of the word monad by haskellers, for instance...
07:46:16 <Marvin--> shaddup :P
07:46:34 <Smerdyakov> earthy, hm.. was that meant to show that all communities have their own lingo that takes some getting used to?
08:06:03 <Smerdyakov> Do any interesting people here have LiveJournals? :)
08:06:25 <Heffalump> Mine is friends-only and not very interesting.
08:06:40 <Heffalump> but I'll add you as a friend if you want
08:08:25 <Smerdyakov> OK. My username is adamch.
08:08:57 <Heffalump> by "not very interesting", IM that it essentially only gets posts when I go abroad.
08:09:04 <Heffalump> s/abroad/away somewhere/
08:09:08 <Smerdyakov> No problemo!
08:10:16 <Heffalump> there you go.
08:12:16 <Smerdyakov> It is done.
08:13:00 <Smerdyakov> Oh no. Your most recent entry is mindless meme propogation from MLP sites. :P
08:13:47 <Heffalump> s'not mindless, I read the article first.
08:13:58 <Heffalump> and we call mindless memes lemmings.
08:14:29 <Heffalump> I don't usually propagate such things, but that one really horrified me :-)
08:14:35 <Heffalump> s/:-)//
08:14:39 <Smerdyakov> Well, you didn't add much to it that readers who read k5 wouldn't already get.
08:15:20 <Heffalump> I don't read k5, though.
08:15:38 <Heffalump> what the blogging world requires is a lemming compressor.
08:15:48 <Heffalump> so however many things you read, it only tells you about things once.
08:17:15 <Smerdyakov> Well, sites like k5 can do that pretty well.

14:19:12 * SyntaxPolice pokes shapr
16:44:44 <hdaume> how to convert CFloat to Float?  :)
16:45:53 <andersca> (toEnum . fromEnum) ?
16:47:47 <Heffalump> you can Enum Floats?
16:48:20 <hdaume> uncurry encodeFloat . decodeFloat seems to work, but seems also very silly
16:48:31 <andersca> Heffalump: I dunno
16:48:33 <Heffalump> what do encode and decode do?
16:48:34 <andersca> prolly not
16:48:53 <Heffalump> isn't CFloat an instance of any useful type class?
16:48:55 <hdaume> convert floats to (Int,Integer) pairs
16:49:00 <hdaume> Heffalump: yes, it is
