00:00:27 <cale> Cochannels are ncurrent.
00:01:28 <shapr> possibly only one thread for delayed events?
00:01:54 <shapr> that might simplify things
00:02:37 <Pseudonym> Some kind of callout queue may be in order.
00:03:47 <shapr> ?
00:04:00 <shapr> btw, was the queue/in order joke purposeful?
00:04:49 <Pseudonym> No.
00:05:03 <Pseudonym> But you may laugh and bolster my ego if you wish.
00:05:26 * shapr laughs
00:05:38 <Pseudonym> Thanks!
00:05:49 * shapr grins
00:06:02 * Pseudonym feels all warm and fuzzy
00:06:14 <cale> I think it's a pretty good pun. Reusable somewhat, too.
00:06:43 <shapr> hi dnm 
00:07:31 <Pseudonym> G'day,
00:07:46 <dnm> Hey shapr
00:07:56 <shapr> dnm: you written any Haskell recently?
00:08:27 <dnm> Nope. Been real busy with the new job.
00:08:39 <dnm> Unfortunately, haven't had much time hack at all.
00:09:56 <Pseudonym> I have a great idea for a book.
00:09:57 <dnm> What about yourself?
00:10:01 <Pseudonym> No time to write it, though.
00:11:19 <Pseudonym> The world needs a decent book on writing APIs.
00:11:38 <shapr> isn't the DesignPatterns book sort of about that?
00:11:45 <Pseudonym> Not really.
00:11:47 <shapr> and the AnalysisPatterns book too?
00:12:00 <Pseudonym> See, the thing is, these are books on how to design code.
00:12:07 <Pseudonym> But they're not on how to design interfaces.
00:12:12 <shapr> what about the XP books?
00:12:22 <Pseudonym> Not so much there, either.
00:12:26 <shapr> those at least give heuristics on getting to a good API
00:12:37 <Pseudonym> I think that refactoring and design patterns are a subset of what I'm thinking of.
00:12:45 <shapr> hasn't Ralph Johnson or Brant written some papers on framework APIs?
00:12:50 <Pseudonym> What _is_ a good API?
00:13:44 <Pseudonym> I think that XP, design patterns etc are fine for working out how to write code.
00:13:47 <shapr> according to the Johnson or Brant paper, you won't know until you try to merge three or more applications into a framework
00:13:58 <Pseudonym> But how do you write code for other people to use?
00:14:29 <shapr> I think that's audience dependent
00:14:56 <shapr> Smalltalk libs are much loved by some, but many people find them too granular
00:15:10 <shapr> I'd say the opposite is true of Java
00:15:16 <shapr> everyone hates Java libs, and they're way too chunky
00:16:13 <shapr> so I guess my initial answer would be, "write a higher-level simple API for the Java people, and a lower level granular API for the Smalltalk people"
00:16:32 <shapr> Pseudonym: ok, now that I've announced my opinions, what's *your* answer?
00:17:09 <shapr> hi kosmikus 
00:17:15 <kosmikus> hi shapr
00:18:38 <shapr> how's code?
00:19:32 <kosmikus> I think I have not written a single line of program code since the ICFP contest.
00:20:00 <shapr> yow
00:20:15 <kosmikus> No, wait, I've updated a TeX package, if that counts.
00:20:30 <shapr> I think so
00:20:42 <Pseudonym> Sorry, afk briefly.
00:20:59 <shapr> irc is asynchronous
00:21:07 <kosmikus> ... and I've looked at Gentoo's portage and tried to understand it.
00:21:15 <Pseudonym> Yes, but I didn't want you to think that I was ignoring you.
00:21:37 <kosmikus> oh, and I didn't want to interrupt :)
00:21:38 <shapr> Pseudonym: well, you are at work, I figure #haskell is a background task anyway :-)
00:21:46 <Pseudonym> :-)
00:21:53 <Pseudonym> I've just been told I need to build a patch.
00:22:03 <Pseudonym> There's my productivity for the week gone.
00:22:25 <shapr> can you actually interrupt on irc?
00:22:26 <Pseudonym> Anyway.
00:24:22 <shapr> I think it's normal for me to carry on multiple conversations in person, since irc has scrollback, it's even easier.
00:24:51 <shapr> it's hard for me to do one thing at a time.
00:25:05 <kosmikus> shapr: on high-traffic channels it becomes really annoying, though
00:25:24 <Pseudonym> You may be right about Smalltalk vs Java.
00:25:25 <kosmikus> if the message you're currently replying to has scrolled off the screen before you finish your answer
00:25:32 <Pseudonym> An even better example is C++ vs Java.
00:25:39 <shapr> kosmikus: I can only hope #haskell reaches that much traffic :-)
00:25:48 <Pseudonym> Java only has classes, whereas C++ has modules _and_ classes.
00:26:11 <Pseudonym> So in C++, you can use a function which takes an object where in Java you'd use a method.
00:26:49 <Pseudonym> This, when applied properly, makes the surface area of C++ APIs _smaller_ than in Java, even though C++ is a more fine-grained language.
00:27:41 <Pseudonym> Also, nobody has gone through all of the tradeoffs.
00:27:58 <Pseudonym> There's an obvious API tradeoff between efficiency and surface area.
00:28:26 <Pseudonym> But there's also, for example, a less obvious tradeoff between efficiency and concurrency.
00:28:33 <shapr> last time I did pair programming in Python, I realized language granularity is somewhat exposed by what information must be exchanged
00:29:06 <shapr> huh? efficiency vs concurrency?
00:29:37 <Pseudonym> Take, for example, a FiniteMap-like data structure.
00:30:05 <Pseudonym> Binary search trees support scanning keys in sorted order.
00:30:18 <Pseudonym> OK, bad example.
00:30:31 <Pseudonym> Consider a FiniteMap-like data structure on Strings.
00:30:40 <Pseudonym> Theoretically, tries are faster than hash tables.
00:31:01 <Pseudonym> However, hash tables allow more concurrency, because you can lock a hash chain.
00:31:07 <shapr> ah
00:31:25 <Pseudonym> Where in tries or binary search trees, you'd have to lock the whole structure.
00:31:31 <shapr> I see
00:31:44 <Pseudonym> Now usually this isn't a concern, but it _is_ a tradeoff.
00:32:07 <Pseudonym> Error handling is another issue.
00:32:14 <Pseudonym> In C++ or Java you'd use exceptions.
00:32:17 <shapr> SMP issues haven't really reached CS teaching
00:32:26 <Pseudonym> In Haskell, you might use the NotJustMaybe idiom.
00:32:40 <shapr> or Either
00:32:55 <Pseudonym> In C, you'd do something else.
00:33:03 <shapr> or real exceptions, though that's more trouble
00:33:10 <Pseudonym> Right.
00:33:54 <shapr> imho, any error that can be Maybe/Either should be
00:34:10 <Pseudonym> Well I happen to like NotJustMaybe.
00:34:32 <Pseudonym> You can make it Maybe or Either or IO exceptions or whatever you want it to be.
00:34:43 <Pseudonym> You leave it up to the caller to decide how they want their exceptions served.
00:35:19 <Pseudonym> Anyway, the point is that this is another issue to be taken into account.
00:35:21 <shapr> yup
00:35:37 <Pseudonym> Surface area, in particular, I think is one of the most important concepts.
00:35:50 <Pseudonym> As the user of an API, you have to limit the amount you have to know in order to use this operation.
00:35:58 <Pseudonym> Sorry, you _want_ to limit it.
00:36:23 <Pseudonym> For example, I don't want to have to know all 200 OpenGL calls inside out in order to get something on the screen.
00:36:54 <Pseudonym> Gotta go home.
00:36:57 <Pseudonym> Night everyone.
00:37:07 <shapr> g'night
00:42:25 <dnm> Hrm.
00:42:29 <dnm> Friday deadline.
00:42:31 <dnm> I want to hack.
00:43:25 <shapr> can you hack for the deadline?
00:43:42 <dnm> The deadline is for another revision for a white paper I'm working on.
00:43:47 <dnm> Which involves no hacking.
00:43:49 <dnm> Sadly.
00:43:54 <dnm> Unless you count TeX.
00:44:02 <dnm> But even then, I have do more actual writing that TeXing.
00:44:06 <Marvin--> morning #haskell
00:44:22 <dnm> Good evening from Oakland, CA.
00:44:37 <shapr> good morning Marvin-- 
00:44:52 <shapr> mice suck
00:45:02 <dnm> shapr: How are you doing? What are you working on these days, professional and hackwise?
00:45:16 <shapr> professionally, more Zope sites
00:45:38 <shapr> for fun; lambdabot, a spam filter, some other random bits
00:45:45 <shapr> oh, I'm learning 3D modelling and OpenGL also
00:45:53 <shapr> now that Igloo has built working HOpenGL debs
00:45:59 * shapr dances enthusiastically
00:46:20 <shapr> and I have a unicycle
00:46:23 <shapr> and I'm learning Swedish
00:46:26 <shapr> so, not much ;-)
00:47:05 <dnm> Hah!
00:47:08 <shapr> what's your white paper about?
00:47:15 <dnm> Terrorism Information Awareness
00:47:25 <shapr> um, okay.
00:48:00 <shapr> is it an interesting white paper?
00:48:02 <dnm> The U.S. government's TIA project? Surely you've heard of it.
00:48:15 <dnm> I hope it will become one by the time I get it published.
00:48:49 <shapr> no, I haven't heard of it.
00:49:05 <Marvin--> sounds propaganda:ish
00:49:09 <shapr> yah, it does.
00:49:26 <shapr> imho, anyone with any experience in cracking understands that systems have holes
00:49:39 <dnm> http://www.darpa.mil/iao/
00:49:52 <dnm> Also, Google for Total Information Awareness, etc.
00:50:29 <shapr> I think that's the answer to a different question
00:54:15 <shapr> it'd be easier to hire some people with the cracker mindset and get them to spot the obvious holes that are easy to fix, and maybe come up with a more adaptive, less brittle system
00:55:15 <dnm> That's sort of the eventual recommendation I make in my white paper.
00:55:32 <dnm> ALbeit with some subtle differences to be a bit more palatable for a government audience.
00:57:30 <shapr> hi Arnia
00:59:07 <Arnia> heya :)
00:59:12 <shapr> dnm: I'd guess the best way to make an adaptive system, is to have multiple overlapping self-adjusting systems. That way, if you attack any one system, the other systems can cover the exposed holes
01:01:43 <Arnia> shapr: had fun last night coming up with new GUI styles. I think I've found one that lets go of WIMPs :)
01:06:57 <shapr> what is it?
01:07:11 <shapr> I've thought of polygonal menus
01:07:38 <shapr> they could be tiled, weighted, escher-tiled, colored, animated
01:07:59 <shapr> still requires a mouse
01:08:07 <shapr> and you can't touch-type with mice
01:10:10 <Arnia> shapr: Uses an Object Relational view of the file system. A qualia based operational style (like suggested in the Humane Interface and encouraged by Zope) combined with CPO based 'lines of information' used to orientate content along some dimension
01:10:48 <shapr> CPO?
01:11:12 <Arnia> Complete partial order
01:11:16 <shapr> oh
01:11:22 <shapr> that sounds very nifty
01:11:30 <shapr> I don't know qualia, but I'm googling ;-)
01:12:29 <shapr> @all-dicts  qualia
01:12:30 <lambdabot> No match for "qualia".
01:12:33 <Arnia> See the work of Jackendoff especially. It will be very suitable for use with proprioreceptive interfaces (you manipulate stuff by moving your whole arm around the screen)
01:13:18 <shapr> oh, Jackendoff is a deep-structure guy, eh?
01:21:27 <Arnia> shapr: One of my academic role models. He's against the syntactocentric models of transformational grammar, instead believing (with lots of good evidence and arguments) that a treebased parse system based on preference rules (such as HPSG and Autosegmental Phonology) is more in line with what we know of the brain
01:21:56 <Arnia> shapr: So no, not a deep structure guy... d-structure is part of transformational grammar :)
01:21:56 <shapr> I would agree with that.
01:22:01 <shapr> oh
01:22:18 <shapr> I think tree based parsing makes more sense.
01:23:08 <Arnia> shapr: Read his 'Foundations of Language'. Its the rallying call for a more unified approach to linguistics, AI, cognitive psychology and biopsychology. Its being heeded by many.
01:23:29 <shapr> I doubt I'll get to it this year :-)
01:23:32 <shapr> so much to read
01:23:54 <shapr> I want to start on the Silver Arrow framework, or whatever you want to call it.
01:23:59 <shapr> what are some famous arrows?
01:24:07 <shapr> the Black Arrow that killed Smaug?
01:24:54 <Arnia> shapr: Red Arrows?
01:25:04 <shapr> what's that?
01:25:56 <shapr> aha
01:27:23 <kosmikus> Arnia: are you a linguist?
01:28:38 <Arnia> kosmikus: linguistics is one of my interests (its the most powerful probe we have into the internal processes of the brain and I'm facinated by better organisation of information for people)
01:30:39 <Arnia> shapr: I'm looking forward to the framework :)
01:30:55 <shapr> me too
01:31:15 <shapr> I want to get something working, just to see what it feels like
01:31:41 <shapr> though at the moment, I should really be learning Plone
01:32:05 <Arnia> http://plone.org/Members/arnia/iconsets/
01:32:32 <shapr> titanium is nice
01:34:01 <Arnia> Danke... Its amazing how people's tastes vary.
02:16:33 <elmex> shapr: hi shapr 
02:16:40 <shapr> hi elmex
02:16:43 <shapr> how are you?
02:17:15 <elmex> hm, i feel hungry, thirsty, have to work in 1 hour, in love, well... short of money
02:17:32 <shapr> being in love is a great thing
02:17:46 <elmex> indeed
02:17:59 <elmex> it's the greatest thing you can't program ;)
02:18:05 <cale> :D
02:18:44 <elmex> hehe, programming perl for money is fun... (at least for me...) but programming CGI for money sucks
02:19:10 <elmex> hehe, i should program the CGI's in haskell ;-P
02:19:42 <elmex> but are there any CGI libs for haskell, which parse all parameters and even handle file-uploads (via POST method)
02:19:59 <shapr> I think so
02:19:59 <cale> does wash?
02:20:08 <shapr> @fact wash
02:20:09 <lambdabot> Nothing
02:20:12 <shapr> oops
02:20:14 <elmex> wash?
02:20:37 <shapr> @fact wash http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/WASH/
02:20:38 <lambdabot> set wash to http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/WASH/
02:21:00 <elmex> coool
02:22:59 <elmex> hm
02:23:31 <elmex> which license?
02:23:40 * shapr looks
02:24:24 <elmex> cant' find it in the source-ball , no LICENSE or COPYING
02:24:34 <elmex> -- © 2001, 2002 Peter Thiemann
02:24:39 <elmex> a copryright ;)
02:26:24 <elmex> hm
02:26:33 <cale> heh, that's sufficiently confusing. Yes, I'm copyrighting it, and yes, you can use it, but exactly what rights I'm giving you...
02:27:10 <elmex> why not GPL? or better, LGPL ?
02:27:41 <shapr> it doesn't say anything that I can find
02:27:43 <shapr> I'll ask him.
02:27:45 <jlouis> why not *BSD?
02:27:53 <jlouis> ;)
02:28:03 <elmex> jlouis: i don't care, as long as i can use it freely and change it like i want
02:28:28 <jlouis> elmex: you cannot do that with GPL unless you disclose your changes
02:28:46 <jlouis> the LGPL is a good compromise though
02:28:51 <elmex> yes
02:28:53 <cale> looks like something that would either be GPL, or BSD, or one of those academic licenses. And you don't have to disclose your changes except to those who you give the program to.
02:29:16 <Marvin--> jlouis: yes you can, but you can't *distribute* your binary changes without offering your source changes
02:29:38 <Marvin--> man, am I tired, I hate sleeping on inflatable mattresses, and I can't sleep when it's too hot
02:29:53 <Marvin--> oh, and I really hate being woken up by the big lamp in the sky shining directly into my eyes :-/
02:30:13 <cale> man, am I tired, it's 5:30 and I haven't made an attempt at sleep.
02:31:20 <cale> my eyes are about ready to fuse shut, and I'm not doing anything particularly useful. Why am I still up?
02:31:29 <Marvin--> cale: quit complaining :P
02:31:39 <Marvin--> I have adequate cause for complaining, you don't ;)
02:32:02 <cale> that's perfectly true. I'm more complaining at myself for being so silly.
02:32:52 <cale> hmm... I'll read the rest of this paper on fundeps in the morning, er... afternoon.
02:33:40 <elmex> fundeps?
02:33:48 <shapr> functional dependencies
02:33:51 <shapr> @fact fundeps
02:33:52 <lambdabot> Nothing
02:33:59 <shapr> @fact fundeps functional dependencies
02:34:00 <lambdabot> set fundeps to functional dependencies
02:34:30 <shapr> @fact fundeps http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/FunDeps
02:34:31 <lambdabot> set fundeps to http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/FunDeps
02:34:34 <cale> http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/pubs/fundeps-esop2000.pdf
02:35:33 <jlouis> cale: easy read
02:36:13 <cale> yeah, seems fairly easy - even in my current state I was going through it okay.
02:36:43 <cale> Interesting ideas to think about though.
02:36:44 <shapr> actually, a @wiki plugin could search titles/text
02:37:43 <elmex> hat isyes
02:38:07 <shapr> eh?
02:38:15 <elmex> never mind
02:38:19 <shapr> was ist das?
02:38:26 <shapr> ich versteh nicht
02:38:39 <elmex> it's garbage in my entry-line
02:38:42 <shapr> oh
02:38:49 <elmex> :))
02:39:13 <shapr> where did you get it from?
02:39:22 <shapr> not qwerty or dvorak
02:40:03 <elmex> ?
02:40:20 <shapr> just wondering where the garbage came from
02:40:29 <elmex> i started typeing something, then forgot it 'hat is' and then wrote 'yes<enter>'
02:40:47 <elmex> i'm using qwerty (even thought i'm in germany)
02:41:11 <shapr> oh, ok
02:41:50 * Marvin-- just loves the current storyline on pvponline.com :)
02:41:56 <elmex> i geuss i will use perl for cgi until i'm more familiar with haskell.... 
02:42:12 <elmex> i love the storyline on userfrienly.org ;)
02:42:42 <shapr> elmex: I think the best way to learn Haskell is to use it for something.
02:42:55 <shapr> like, pick one small non-critical CGI and write it in Haskell anyway.
02:43:48 <elmex> shapr: indeed, i already have a project, an irc server :) (currently planned without linking with other servers)
02:44:44 <elmex> i'm not writing CGI's for myself anyway :)
02:46:19 <elmex> damn, userfrienly is down :(((
02:47:42 <earthy> elmex: still? hmmm...
02:48:18 <elmex> earthy: the route ends after border.nwm.paralynx.net
02:48:36 * elmex begins to cry: no userfrienly in the morning
02:55:53 <shapr> hi usander 
02:56:01 * shapr comforts elmex with a dose of memepool.com
02:56:43 <usander> hi
02:56:48 <shapr> how's code?
02:57:20 <usander> asking me? not functional *G*
02:57:25 <shapr> heh
02:57:33 <shapr> written any cool code lately?
02:57:59 <usander> nothing in haskell, only C and Eiffel
02:58:22 <shapr> code can be cool in almost any language.
02:58:58 <elmex> shapr: what is memepool ?
02:59:28 <shapr> http://www.memepool.com/
02:59:35 <shapr> it's a dangerously addictive website
03:01:53 <elmex> shapr: *rofl* @ http://www.mdunkerton.com/videos/hkzkt10.wmv
03:02:25 <shapr> like I said, dangerously addictive
03:02:35 <elmex> cool
03:02:38 <elmex> new bookmark ;) thanks
03:03:58 <usander> I am looking for some laaarge Haskell projects, to see how it works in real life apps. Can anybody give me a hint?
03:04:23 <Heffalump> GHC is quite large.
03:04:39 <shapr> there's the InForM workbench
03:04:40 <elmex> lol
03:04:44 <shapr> it even has xemacs bindings
03:05:02 <shapr> usander: what do you consider large?
03:05:38 <usander> Hmm, in Delphi terms (looking for a replacement) more than 400 forms.
03:06:37 <shapr> um
03:07:12 <shapr> what's a form?
03:07:16 <shapr> like a VB form?
03:07:29 <earthy> and how does it correspond to `saner' metrics such as LOC? :)
03:08:04 <usander> Yeah, we are doing databased business apps here.
03:08:46 <shapr> from what I've seen, Haskell gives you better high-end abstraction than anything else
03:08:59 <usander> (I think 1 -2 millions LOC)
03:09:35 <usander> Agreed, I really like it. But I would like to present my boss a few references.
03:10:21 <shapr> the NSA is using Haskell ;-)
03:10:46 <usander> That's a point :-)
03:11:40 <shapr> http://www.cryptol.net/
03:12:37 <elmex> NSA?
03:12:53 <shapr> National Security Administration of the USA
03:13:00 <elmex> i know, but they don't exist ;)
03:13:05 <Marvin--> isn't it Agency?
03:13:33 <shapr> yah, something like that
03:13:38 <shapr> they try not to be popular
03:14:24 <elmex> but they are ;)
03:14:50 <elmex> so, i'm out of here now... programming perl for food :)
03:14:53 <shapr> cya
03:15:02 <elmex> may i part?
03:15:19 <shapr> er, huh?
03:15:35 <shapr> part the channel?
03:15:41 <shapr> you don't need my permission for that
03:15:44 <elmex> ah, well, .... going over to the office... there i will re-attach the screen :)
03:15:50 <shapr> ah
03:27:37 <elmex> hehe
04:17:21 * shapr boings cheerfully
04:19:01 <Igloo> Hiya
04:22:19 <shapr> hi Igloo 
04:32:41 * earthy sees a great need voor a better build system than GNU Make
04:33:55 <Igloo> Indeed
04:34:49 <elmex> GNU make is ok, but automake and autoconf are ... hm.. well. how to explain it: i tryed 3-4 times really to figure them out... no clue yet.. i'm fine with plain and simple makefiles
04:37:58 <Marvin--> elmex: unfortunately, a gazillion different Unixes and some different Linux distributions don't agree with you
04:38:26 <elmex> Marvin--: oh :)
04:38:31 <earthy> automake and autoconf are a shitload simpler than having to write that stuff by hand
04:39:16 <Marvin--> automake is nice, autoconf is complicated, especially when you get into m4 macros, but it's quite nice to have someone else check for all the quirks on this particular system, instead of you having to reproduce it yourself
04:39:28 <Marvin--> the main problem with automake is that there are several very incompatible versions :)
04:39:38 <elmex> ...

06:38:02 <SyntaxPolice> howdy
06:39:39 <Igloo> Hi, how goes?
06:41:00 <Heffalump> which bits of PLI are people going to, btw?
06:42:23 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: not bad, you?
06:42:38 <SyntaxPolice> Heffalump: ICFP / Haskell Workshop / HIM
06:43:01 <Igloo> Too hot, but otherwise OK
06:43:21 * Igloo is going to ICFP+HW
07:04:45 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: no A/C?
07:04:59 * Heffalump thinks our basement offices are really nice and cool
07:05:02 * shapr yawns
07:05:05 <shapr> hi SyntaxPolice!
07:05:21 <Igloo> Nope, but it's OK in the lab anyway
07:05:27 * Igloo had only just got in when I said the above
07:08:14 * Arnia stretches and works on getting plone 1.1 running...
07:08:19 <Arnia> *sighs*
07:10:01 <shapr> amazon is calling me
07:10:04 <shapr> what should I buy?
07:10:06 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: woohooo!
07:10:13 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: get me an umm.
07:10:14 <Arnia> Designing with Web Standards :)
07:10:15 <SyntaxPolice> wireless card
07:10:17 <SyntaxPolice> !
07:10:22 <shapr> does amazon sell those?
07:10:25 <shapr> I was talking about books ;-)
07:10:29 <shapr> any recommendations?
07:10:34 * Arnia bounces
07:10:40 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: I wanted to know where you want t ostay for the night of the 28th :) I was thinkgin stockholm.
07:10:48 <SyntaxPolice> but we had talked about uppsula.
07:10:54 <Arnia> Zeldman's Designing with Web Standards and Joe Clark's Building Accessible Websites
07:10:56 <shapr> I have The Humane Interface by Jef Raskin and The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander
07:10:59 <SyntaxPolice> so as soon as you decide, I'll make the reservations
07:11:14 <Igloo> I could recommend Ender's Games, GEB etc but I think you probably recommended them all to me  :-)
07:11:22 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: I agree with kosmikus, I'm good at staying up late, but not good at getting up early.
07:11:32 <shapr> Igloo: heh, that's true. Any other books you recommend?
07:11:39 <Heffalump> I really should read GEB.
07:11:43 <Arnia> The Illuminatus Trilogy is good
07:11:50 * Heffalump got bored half way into the first book of that.
07:12:33 <Arnia> Ah, its one of those books you love or you hate. I love it :)
07:12:35 <Igloo> I think a "GEB for people who have done CS degrees" would be good, but I like it anyway
07:12:48 <shapr> oh, I could get the second Edward Tufte book
07:12:48 <Igloo> shapr: Nothing springs to mind
07:12:50 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: this is a good book: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465046746/qid=1058364744/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/103-3752820-0660661
07:13:13 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: do you like C.S. Lewis?
07:13:29 <SyntaxPolice> that link is a book by Papert called Mindstorms about using logo to teach children to program.
07:13:46 <shapr> yes, I've read a lot of CS Lewis
07:14:04 <shapr> hi debug 
07:14:10 <debug> yo shapr
07:14:15 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: that looks like a book that fits my .sig ;-)
07:14:41 <shapr> debug: how's code?
07:14:54 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: ever read the Space Trilogy?
07:15:17 <shapr> what author?
07:15:18 <debug> shapr: not much lately
07:15:24 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: lewis
07:15:30 <shapr> he wrote a space trilogy??
07:15:35 <SyntaxPolice> wait, whats your .sig?
07:15:48 <Marvin--> logo... that sounds familiar, is that the turtle graphics thingy?
07:15:52 <shapr> my .sig is: I've tried to teach people autodidactism, but it seems they always have to learn it for themselves.
07:15:57 <shapr> Marvin--: yah, the turtle
07:15:57 <Igloo> Yes, Marvin
07:16:04 <shapr> have you guys seen starlogo?
07:16:16 <Igloo> No?
07:16:37 <shapr> starlogo lets you program sixty thousand turtles at once.
07:16:58 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: here's the first book of the trilogy: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684823802/qid=1058364999/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-9780661-0082367?v=glance&s=books
07:17:27 <shapr> one example: you have ants, you have wood chips, you programs to ants to 1) pick up a woodchip they find 2) if they already have a woodchip, put down a woodchip
07:17:36 <shapr> then all the chips get stacked into a single pile
07:17:47 * Igloo reads http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/ and smiles
07:18:01 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: oh, I have read those, but it was some decades ago
07:18:07 <SyntaxPolice> ah OK
07:18:49 <Marvin--> one of the labs in the chalmers afp course is to write a turtle graphics domain-specific language that handles concurrent turtles
07:19:02 <SyntaxPolice> heh
07:19:23 <shapr> I think starlogo would be good for AFRP 
07:19:43 <Arnia> shapr: We think EVERYTHING is good for AFRP ;)
07:20:19 <Marvin--> well, this was a pretty simple monadic thing
07:21:09 <Igloo> Oh, did you get your models working with HOpenGL, shapr?
07:21:27 <shapr> no, I got distracted by work.
07:21:36 <shapr> plus it's so much fun to make models :-)
07:21:39 <Igloo> Ah  :-(
07:21:43 <Igloo> lol
07:21:51 <shapr> have you tried wings3d?
07:22:24 <Igloo> No, but I did notice it is written in Erlang
07:22:30 <shapr> yup
07:22:57 <shapr> I wonder how close Erlang and Haskell really are...
07:23:04 <shapr> I know it's easy to port ML flavors
07:23:35 * Igloo has it on his mental list of languages to look at
07:26:14 <Marvin--> erlang is pretty neat, in our concurrent programming course we had a lab in erlang
07:26:35 <Marvin--> I don't quite remember what it was, but it was neat :-)
07:26:36 * debug found erlang to be too dangerous
07:27:49 <debug> no typechecking led to a whole new possibilities for bugs to appear
07:27:54 <Marvin--> http://www.md.chalmers.se/Cs/Grundutb/Kurser/ppht/labs/lab3/
07:28:35 <debug> s/new/new group of/
07:28:47 * Marvin-- shrugs
07:28:52 <Marvin--> I'm used to working in Python
07:28:54 <shapr> maybe I should buy memory instead
07:29:17 <shapr> are there any recommended online shops in .se ?
07:29:18 <Igloo> Why do you have a desire to spend money?
07:29:39 <shapr> because suddenly I have a credit card  =)
07:29:45 * shapr bounces dangerously
07:30:01 <Igloo> :-)
07:30:05 <shapr> actually, it's a debit card, but I've never had one before, so...
07:30:11 <Igloo> Wow
07:30:28 <Arnia> Couldn't live without my debit card... won't touch a credit card though :)
07:30:34 <shapr> I went thirty years without any form of credit card
07:31:21 * shapr pokes Marvin-- 
07:31:27 <Smerdyakov> The Internet changes everything!
07:31:31 <shapr> do you recommend any online shops here in .se?
07:31:38 <Smerdyakov> Some places won't even accept debit cards, so I had to get a credit card. :-(
07:31:46 * earthy has had a debit card since he was 16 or somesuch
07:31:49 <shapr> I have a Visa debit card
07:32:01 <Marvin--> shapr: I shop from datorbutiken.se and komplett.se
07:32:07 <earthy> and a credit card for those pesky foreign mail-order companies that don't understand debit. ;)
07:32:08 <shapr> Marvin--: ok, thanks
07:32:09 <Heffalump> credit cards are better, you have more consumer protection
07:32:10 <Smerdyakov> At least my debit card provider stored no address information, so sites that wanted to do that kind of validation denied it.
07:32:15 <Marvin--> shapr: when I bought my athlon machine, I think I bought about half from each, depending on the prices :)
07:32:17 <Heffalump> but debit cards with VISA are generally fine
07:32:45 <Igloo> Erlang looks isomorphic to Haskell at first glance. I imagine it's strict as it doesn't seem to be boasting about being lazy - is it notably different from ML?
07:32:58 <Marvin--> I haven't ever used ML :)
07:33:20 <earthy> igloo: but for syntax and typing
07:33:21 <Igloo> It's for the best, Marvin  :-)
07:33:28 <earthy> it's not
07:33:35 <Igloo> earthy: Is Erlang untyped?
07:33:37 <Marvin--> yes
07:33:53 <Igloo> Ah, so it's the perl of functional languages  :-)
07:34:08 <Marvin--> heh
07:34:13 <Marvin--> except that it's not that ugly
07:34:20 * Igloo makes a note not to repeat that in Uppsala
07:34:25 <shapr> heh
07:34:30 <Marvin--> and the lightweight message passing is really neat
07:34:35 * shapr quickly quotes Igloo 
07:34:39 <Marvin--> yay, QuotesPage
07:35:10 <Igloo> :-P
07:35:28 * shapr is teasing
07:35:53 <Marvin--> aww
07:35:58 <Marvin--> I think you should add it to QP :)
07:36:15 <shapr> Marvin--: what do they call registered ram in swedish? :-)
07:36:42 <Marvin--> shapr: "original-minnen" if you're talking about what I think you're taling about
07:36:44 <Marvin--> talKing
07:37:03 <Heffalump> TH is untyped, right? ;-)
07:37:11 <Marvin--> heheheh
07:37:45 <shapr> registered ram is ECC + some extra features
07:38:13 <Igloo> Nah, TH is typed. It's the bit in the middle that is untyped  :-)
07:38:54 <shapr> oy, 3300 kronor for a gig
07:39:02 <shapr> sheez
07:39:06 <shapr> maybe I'll buy books.
07:41:44 <shapr> what's CAS Latency? How do I know what flavor my mobo wants?
07:42:15 <Heffalump> it's usually either 2 or 3, isn't it?
07:42:28 <Heffalump> I think faster RAM can do 2, and slower RAM 3. ICBW though.
07:42:31 <shapr> yes, but which one do I need?
07:42:40 <Igloo> Your BIOS setup probably knows
07:42:43 <shapr> good point
07:42:54 <Heffalump> munchkin noticed I could turn it down when I put some faster RAM in it
07:43:09 <Heffalump> I think the switch comes between 66 and 100 or 100 and 133 (in MHz of the RAM)
07:43:19 <shapr> oh, I see
07:43:50 <shapr> thanks
07:44:21 <Heffalump> I think these days you should just buy PC133 RAM.
07:44:30 <Heffalump> since nobody actually bothers making anything slower
07:44:41 <Heffalump> and so slower stuff actually ends up more expensive, bizarrely
07:48:52 <shapr> I worry about graphics cards that have optional liquid cooling accessories.
07:54:32 <Arnia> shapr: coooooooooooooool... *wants one*
08:00:42 <earthy> CAS latency is the latency between providing a RAM chip with the address you want to read from and the chip providing the data from that address, in clockcycles.
08:01:24 <earthy> mobo's deal with all latencies.
08:01:35 <earthy> CAS2 PC100 RAM is faster than CAS3 PC133 RAM though. ;)
08:01:48 <shapr> so now I just have to figure out what sort I have
08:02:27 <earthy> (owh, and both PC100 and PC133 RAM are kinda outdated, these days ;))
08:03:17 <earthy> (but if you want to add to an existing mobo... well...)
08:04:01 <Heffalump> does CAS3 PC133 RAM exist?
08:04:11 <earthy> Heffalump: sure does.
08:04:31 * earthy 's been bitten by it in server hardware
08:04:39 <shapr> I have server hardware
08:04:51 <shapr> it's not as much fun as I thought ;-)
08:05:03 <earthy> loud, noisy, obnoxious. I know. ;)
08:05:10 <shapr> and *hot*
08:05:28 <earthy> uhuh. there's a reason there's serverrooms with lots of support infrastructure to put servers in. ;)
08:05:30 <shapr> four extra case fans is sufficient unless it's summer.
08:05:40 <Heffalump> oh, I assumed the CAS was tied directly to the speed. Doh :-)
08:05:50 <earthy> Heffalump: no sirree. :)
08:06:10 <shapr> if I run this box at 200% during the summer, it overheats in about five minutes.
08:06:14 <earthy> (aren't computers wonderful? :) so delicately complex devices :))
08:06:41 <hdaume> morning folks
08:06:42 <shapr> hi hal
08:06:53 <shapr> so, who started calling it halinone?
08:08:01 <shapr> earthy: how can I find out what kind of ram I have now?
08:08:17 * shapr opens the case
08:08:35 <earthy> if you have a DOS bootfloppy floating around somewhere you can try ctram (IIRC)
08:09:26 <hdaume> shapr: the fact that my name is a substring didn't even occur to me until after i had it all packaged up :)
08:10:26 <earthy> owh, ctSPD or ctRAMtst (at http://www.heise.de/ct/ftp/ctspd.html and http://www.heise.de/ct/ctsi/ctramtst.zip )
08:11:30 <shapr> thanks
08:12:40 <earthy> (sorry for the german sites :))
08:13:07 <Marvin--> ruunnn tooo theeee hilllls
08:13:17 <shapr> ich habe keine ahnung!
08:13:17 <Marvin--> (sorry, Iron Maiden mode)
08:13:36 <earthy> ah, er versteht auch nur bahnhof. ;)
08:14:20 <Marvin--> oh come on, I get enough German here at debcamp
08:14:40 <earthy> I was talking 'bout shapr ;)
08:14:59 <Igloo> Swedish people: Are any of Switch, Maestro and Cirrus on a debit card any use over there?
08:15:17 <earthy> Cirrus and Maestro should do wonders
08:15:31 <Marvin--> no idea, really
08:15:41 <Heffalump> presumably Visa will too?
08:15:41 <earthy> marvin--: don't have a debit card?
08:15:54 <Marvin--> I have VISA
08:16:02 <earthy> hm. right.
08:16:10 * Heffalump wonders how earthy knows about Swedish cash machines :-)
08:16:15 * Igloo is assuming VISA credit card will be fine in places that take CC
08:16:25 <earthy> heffalump: my girlfriend is kinda into traveling to sweden ;)
08:16:29 <Heffalump> ah :-)
08:16:55 <shapr> aha, kingston model numbers turned up what kind of ram I have
08:17:22 <earthy> heffalump: and she assured me that dutch debit cards work fine in swedish cash machines ;)
08:17:29 <earthy> due to the cirrus and maestro stuff. ;)
08:17:33 <Marvin--> having VISA is very useful here, even if you don't pay with it, since there are two competing brands of cash machines, and if you have the wrong card, you need something like VISA to get money from them...
08:17:43 * Igloo finds http://global.mastercard.com/cgi-bin/atm/atm.cgi?region=kr&country=swe&city=Uppsala
08:17:48 <Heffalump> do the cash machines charge a fee?
08:18:11 <shapr> for only $600 I could have 2GB more of ram.
08:18:11 <Marvin--> for foreign accounts, I think so, yes, but not for Swedish accouns of the Other Type
08:18:18 <Heffalump> hmph
08:18:39 <Heffalump> d'you know if it's percentage or per-transaction?
08:18:47 <earthy> shapr: `only'. owh, and note: linux does not use > 2GB by default. :)
08:18:51 <earthy> (on 32bit architectures)
08:18:53 <Marvin--> when I go abroad (which is very rare :) I usually exchange some money before and bring my VISA card in case I happen to need more
08:19:02 <Marvin--> Heffalump: per transaction I think, but I'm not sure
08:19:11 <Marvin--> or maybe it's both, who knows
08:19:11 <shapr> earthy: it doesn't even use above ~970mb by default
08:19:14 <earthy> Heffalump: I've never seen percentage charges from ATMs
08:19:18 <shapr> unless you've enable himem support
08:19:33 <Heffalump> I'll probably get some cash before I come.
08:19:41 <shapr> kronor are nifty
08:19:44 <shapr> pretty colors
08:19:55 * earthy hints at checking transfer rates
08:20:00 <earthy> and commission
08:20:18 <earthy> transfer rates at ATMs tend to be quite a bit better than at changing stations
08:20:30 <earthy> plus you only pay ATM fees, not changing commission
08:20:33 <Marvin--> the Norwegian money is weird, they have 100kr and 500kr bills just like we do, but they also have 200kr bills!
08:20:51 <Heffalump> Sweden _is_ an EU member, isn't it?
08:21:01 <Marvin--> yes, but not an EMU member yet
08:21:07 <Heffalump> yeah.
08:21:12 <Heffalump> it's in good company :-)
08:21:18 <earthy> denmark... ;)
08:21:22 <earthy> the UK
08:21:23 <Marvin--> we're having a public vote on it in fall
08:21:29 <Heffalump> which way is that likely to go?
08:21:31 <Marvin--> well, advisory public vote anyway
08:21:39 <Marvin--> right now it looks like no
08:21:42 <Marvin--> but who knows
08:21:50 <Heffalump> sensible lot ;-)
08:22:04 <earthy> pity. there's *big* comfortpoints from having eypo's
08:22:13 <Marvin--> I dunno, I'd really like to get the euro, but I'm not sure how much I care for the rest
08:22:20 <earthy> even if they temporarily increase inflation
08:22:34 * Heffalump likes the rest of Europe having the euro, it means it's easy to deal with foreign currency
08:22:36 <Marvin--> they actually even phrased the question in the vote as "should Sweden switch to using the euro?" which I think is a bit misleading
08:22:42 <Heffalump> but I'm quite happy that we don't have it
08:22:52 * earthy whacks Heffalump
08:23:11 <dark> In NL they used a government propaganda campaign to promote the euro.
08:23:11 <Marvin--> it's not as if we have any emotional ties to our currency, we've switched a lot of times in our history
08:23:39 <earthy> silly brits, I *still* have a pound 42 left from my last trip to the UK
08:23:41 <Marvin--> dark: I guess one problem here is that there's a big split in the socialist democrat party over EMU
08:24:00 <dark> earthy: Should have spent it.
08:24:20 <Marvin--> dark: are you coming to debconf?
08:24:31 <earthy> dark: a bit tough if you're buying tea and whiskey to the tune of 200 pounds when you're leaving the country
08:24:40 <earthy> (not all just for me :))
08:24:44 <dark> Marvin: Yes.
08:25:13 <earthy> owh, and Pimm's ofcourse
08:25:14 <Marvin--> dark: yay
08:25:26 * Marvin-- is hacking on d-i in Oslo
08:26:13 <earthy> anyway, time to catch my bus
08:26:38 <shapr> hm, 184 pin ram
08:26:38 <shapr> weird
08:27:07 <Marvin--> it's far too hot here, what with the IFI building basically being a greenhouse, and putting ten-fifteen hackers with computers in one room
08:27:16 <dark> Handy if you're in a hurry and you want to stab someone 184 times.
08:27:22 <shapr> hi dark!
08:27:29 <dark> Greetings :)
08:27:38 <shapr> wasssup?
08:27:47 <dark> shapr: Going to Oslo tomorrow.
08:27:50 <shapr> spiffy
08:27:55 <shapr> going to meet Marvin--?
08:28:01 <dark> Yeah, unless he runs away.
08:28:05 <Marvin--> dark: when are you arriving?
08:28:06 <shapr> Marvin--: running away?
08:28:22 <dark> marvin: late evening.  I probably won't show up at the conference until the day after.
08:28:42 <Marvin--> shapr: if I keep hacking d-i, I'm likely to lose what remnants of sanity I have left, after that I can't really make any promises...
08:28:45 <Marvin--> dark: ah, all right
08:28:46 <shapr> heh
08:29:04 <dark> It's a debcamp.  I don't think sanity is even on the menu.
08:30:13 <dark> I wonder what I'll do with all my web games while I'm away.  I guess I can find a net connection somewhere there...
08:30:35 <Marvin--> yes, we have plenty of net here
08:30:38 <Marvin--> (obviously, duh)
08:30:47 <dark> But do you have plenty of computer?  I don't have a laptop.
08:31:00 <Marvin--> there are a few thin clients running skolelinux
08:31:13 <Marvin--> just remember to unset LANG when you log in if you don't know Norwegian ;I)
08:31:33 <dark> It's probably close enough to swedish anyway :)
08:31:40 <Marvin--> yes it is
08:32:36 <shapr> hm, Sven Panne is hopping today
08:32:43 <shapr> new HOpenGL goodies
08:35:45 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: that abe guy wanted to know what the diff bt the ghc6 debs in haskell-unstable and the ones in the debian arvhives are :)
08:35:59 <shapr> hi d-bug 
08:36:14 <d-bug> hi shapr
08:36:15 <SyntaxPolice> oh wait, there aren't any in unstable/experimental
08:36:17 <SyntaxPolice> nm
08:36:18 <shapr> Igloo: I was wondering that also, are there ghc6-cvs debs in haskell-experimental?
08:36:26 <shapr> ah, ok
08:36:54 <Igloo> Syn: Do you mean s/unstable/experimental-stable/?
08:37:13 <Igloo> I didn't intend to put unstable debs on syntaxpolice.org
08:37:29 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: right, I was on crack. nm :)
08:37:32 <Igloo> Oh, I should read all the conversation before speaking
08:37:41 <lilith> experimental-stable? *blinks*
08:37:44 <Igloo> shapr: Not yet
08:37:46 <shapr> hi lilith 
08:37:48 <SyntaxPolice> lilith:  :)
08:37:53 <lilith> hi shapr 
08:38:08 <Igloo> Hmmm, calling it something that isn't a Debian section might have been a better plan in retrospect  :-)
08:38:10 <shapr> Igloo: I'm thrilled you produced ghc6 debs and hopengl debs, so I won't be pushy ;-)
08:38:47 <Igloo> shapr: I'll do it when I get some time
08:39:08 <lilith> yeah, good job on producing debs :)
08:39:29 <SyntaxPolice> lilith: haskell-experimental is a debian archive for stuff thats not in the official archive
08:39:33 <SyntaxPolice> @fact haskell-experimental
08:39:33 <lambdabot> Nothing
08:40:13 <SyntaxPolice> lilith: anyway, see http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/DebianUsers
08:40:29 <shapr> Igloo: thanks for the spinning cube, it's very cool
08:40:55 * Igloo can't make a nice lambda (easily) without NURBS though  :-(
08:41:06 <shapr> have you asked Sven about NURBS?
08:41:29 <Igloo> I hinted I was interested in it
08:41:38 <shapr> what did he say?
08:41:45 <Igloo> Nothing
08:41:56 <shapr> @yow
08:41:57 <lambdabot> There's a SALE on STRETCH SOCKS down at the "7-11"!!
08:42:01 * shapr boings cheerfully
08:42:50 <lilith> SyntaxPolice: ahr. cool :)
08:44:20 * Marvin-- has been meaning to post a reply to delYsid (Mario Lang) about the compile-on-install issue, but haven't gotten around to it
08:45:02 * lilith wonders why ghc4 is still in unstable
08:45:46 <Igloo> It's allegedly removed
08:46:08 <Igloo> I'm not sure if all dependencies have to go or if they just have to become satisfiable without it
08:47:50 <o3> re
08:49:02 <lilith> hmm
08:49:28 * lilith hunts up docs on the debian website
08:51:47 <Igloo> I maintain everythign that depends on it anyway, so I'll just reupload everything soon
09:25:05 * Marvin-- boggles at bugs.debian.org/201585
09:25:08 <Igloo> Oooo, Evaluators. That's got to be a good sign. </Sven in HOpenGL CVS>
09:26:25 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: great bug report :)
09:26:38 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: hilarious
09:27:09 <SyntaxPolice> Bug 23425 - Mozilla, Konquror, Galeon, pump, gnus, evolution, GAIM, pine, elm: "I can't get on AOL."
09:27:10 <SyntaxPolice> ;)
09:27:13 <Heffalump> Evaluators?
09:27:46 <Igloo> I think NURBS use Evaluators, which I think evaluate the polynomial at various points
09:31:33 <shapr> hi
09:31:39 <shapr> speaking of overheating machines
09:31:51 <shapr> it looks like half a fur coat is stuck in one of my CPU coolers
09:32:35 <Igloo> :-)
09:34:17 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: oh, thats my fur coat, can I have it back?
09:35:19 <shapr> heh
09:45:14 <Igloo> Have you looked at the dh_perl* stuff, Syn?
09:45:54 * Igloo has no idea if a similar thing would be useful here as I don't actually know what it does
09:45:55 <Heffalump> dh_perl?
09:46:21 <Heffalump> oh, duh
10:07:31 <keverets> Anyone here know much about HaXml?
10:08:02 <keverets> I'm trying to figure out how to pattern match against a "OneOf3" type.
10:08:16 <shapr> I know a bit about HXmlToolbox
10:09:02 <keverets> I took a quick look at HXmlToolbox, but couldn't get it to work as easily as I could the HaXml stuff.
10:10:15 <keverets> would you recommend that I take a closer look?  I'm trying to transform files (based on a DTD) into Haskell types.
10:11:11 <keverets> HaXml has a DtdToHaskell program that helps (though it needs a bit of touching up occasionally), but it comes out with these "OneOfX" types that I don't grok.
10:11:51 <shapr> if you want Haskell types, I'd suggest HaXml
10:12:21 <keverets> ah, then perhaps I'll stick with that.
10:13:56 <shapr> HXmlToolbox uses an algebraic tree type to represent both the DTD and the Document
10:14:09 <shapr> so it's simpler for processing, since every node is the same type
10:14:17 <shapr> at least, that was my experience
10:34:46 * earthy does the raindance
10:36:50 <Marvin--> yes, please, send some clouds over here
10:38:05 <acinom> hi
10:40:23 <hdaume> perl question :): how do i set the path for where perl finds .pms?
10:40:41 <Igloo> @INC
10:40:42 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "INC", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
10:40:53 <Marvin--> heh
10:41:24 <Heffalump> use lib 'foo/';
10:41:26 <Heffalump> is better
10:43:54 <acinom> How could I test the nth bit of a number ? 
10:44:05 <hdaume> import Data.Bits, then testBit :)
10:44:48 <acinom> yes .. but, how could I use it X'D ? I mean.. I get the next error:
10:45:23 <acinom> testBit 20 1
10:45:29 <acinom> interactive>:1:
10:45:29 <acinom>     Ambiguous type variable(s) `a' in the constraint `Bits a'
10:45:29 <acinom>     arising from use of `testBit' at <interactive>:1
10:45:29 <acinom>     In the definition of `it': testBit 20 1
10:45:37 <acinom> Sorry .. !
10:45:40 <hdaume> testBit (20 :: Integer) 1
10:45:55 <acinom> hdaume: uhm.. let me try ..
10:55:24 <acinom> hdaume: thx ..
10:59:46 <keverets> is there a way to have ghci load Data.Bits from the command line?
11:01:05 <shapr> put ":m + Data.Bits" into your ~/.ghci
11:02:56 <keverets> ah, so just a config option then.
11:03:13 <shapr> there may be a command-line way to do it, but I don't know it off the top of my head.
11:03:32 <cale> "My single most common error in Smalltalk is to forget to answer the result of a method. This was a very common error I used to make in C/C++ as well. In those languages I solved it by never using them again."
11:03:48 <cale> :)
11:03:58 <shapr> what does that mean? "answer the result" ?
11:03:59 <Marvin--> "answer"?
11:04:09 <shapr> you mean explicitly return?
11:04:14 <cale> yes, I think.
11:04:18 <cale> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForgetToAnswerTheResult
11:04:19 <shapr> ah, that makes sense.
11:08:51 <shapr> I really like Haskell.
11:09:03 <shapr> it's sooo much more elegant than C
11:11:04 <Marvin--> heh, yeah
11:11:30 <Marvin--> I keep thinking I should construct a language that combines features from imperative and functional languages, but the syntax always ends up being haskell + fairly heavy usage of the do construct...
11:11:42 <Marvin--> the everything-is-an-expression idea is sooo neat
11:11:56 <shapr> yah it is
11:12:11 <shapr> the simplest OpenGL demo in C is *huge*
11:12:24 * shapr goes off to unicycle for a bit
11:13:00 <Igloo> It shouldn't be much bigger than the Haskell code is using GLUT with both
11:15:13 <Marvin--> uhm, given a format string with a bunch of %s:s in it, and a list of strings, is there a sane way to get the %s:es replaced with the strings in the list? (list being a char **)
11:15:43 <Heffalump> in C?
11:15:52 <Marvin--> yes
11:15:53 <Marvin--> :/
11:15:59 <Heffalump> allocate a new buffer by calculating how big it needs to be
11:16:28 <Igloo> A pritnf command including v and s will do that for you won't it?
11:16:35 <Heffalump> then just write the obvious loop over the format string, going into a subloop to copy in arguments when appropriate
11:16:43 <Igloo> You can write to NULL with a max size of 0 to find out how big a buffer you need
11:16:45 <Heffalump> oh, yes, or that, of course :-)
11:16:51 <Marvin--> Igloo: no, that requirs a va_list, I have a char ** list
11:17:02 <Heffalump> there's a version with a v in it that takes an array, IIRC
11:17:04 <earthy> but even in C almost everything is an expression...
11:17:17 <Heffalump> oh, sorry.
11:17:24 <Marvin--> Heffalump: I don't think so
11:18:07 <Marvin--> brb
11:18:32 <Igloo> Can you not make one by iterating over the array
11:18:42 <Heffalump> it seems not
11:18:49 <Heffalump> they are constructed straight from the stack, AFAICT
11:19:28 <Heffalump> you could do some evilness with inline assembly ;-)
11:20:37 <Igloo> Oh yeah, it was going the other way I was thinking of
11:20:57 <earthy> hmmm. well... there *is* a trick that you could use in building your own va_list from the char** but it'd be ugl
11:20:58 <earthy> +y
11:22:04 <Heffalump> what's the trick?
11:25:56 <Marvin--> recursive helper function with varargs?
11:27:01 <Heffalump> how would that work?
11:28:29 <Marvin--> I don't know, it's another suggestion I got somewhere else
11:29:00 <Marvin--> but since I just realized that currently there will only be zero or one occurrences of %s, I'm going for a switch (arg_count) for now
11:30:08 <Heffalump> oh, can you take a varargs list and make a recursive call using that list but extending it by one?
11:30:24 <Heffalump> actually, I'd be quite surprised if that was possible
13:02:58 <jlouis> Should I do a writeup about getting GreenCard3.01 and HSX11-1.00 to work on FreeBSD/OpenBSD (it is not a clean install)
13:09:25 <SyntaxPolice> jlouis: sounds useful, I would mail alastair about it and post it to the wiki or something; he's working to make the build system as painless as possible.
13:13:57 <jlouis> SyntaxPolice: exactly what I thought might be useful
13:19:22 <SyntaxPolice> is it a shortcoming of the makefiles?
13:26:26 <jlouis> more than that: 1. gmake dependency
13:26:30 <jlouis> 2. bash dependency
13:26:48 <jlouis> 3. intall -D is not a valid parameter on FreeBSD/OpenBSD
13:27:02 <jlouis> 4. OpenBSD has it's own ar, thus for OpenBSD: dependency on BinUtils
13:27:17 <jlouis> for HSX11:
13:27:28 <jlouis> -I/usr/X11R6/include should be added the correct places
13:27:36 <jlouis> about ti
13:27:37 <jlouis> it
13:28:05 <SyntaxPolice> bash depends sounds a little yucky.  whats intall -D?
13:28:36 <SyntaxPolice> so in openBSD it has to depend on BinUtils to get the right version of ar?
13:30:42 <SyntaxPolice> sounds like autoconf can fix a bunch of that. so how do freeBSD and openBSD express build-depends? just something in the makefiles?
13:30:57 <keverets> man install
13:33:27 <SyntaxPolice> heh, I guess thats different from intall ;)
13:48:16 <jlouis> install -D is to create directories along with the install AFAIR
13:48:55 <jlouis> you can rewrite the ar(1) semantics to make it understood by OpenBSD's ar(1) as well (and that is probably neater)
13:49:12 <jlouis> build-deps is expressed in the makefiles, yes
13:49:27 <jlouis> and yes, Autoconf can fix all of that (though greencard does not use Autoconf :( )

15:23:38 * Igloo investigates quickcheck
15:38:51 <phubuh_> alright, i'm back
15:39:25 <Heffalump> what's cdbs?
15:39:36 <phubuh_> cdbs - common build system for Debian packages
15:39:54 <Heffalump> and that's in haskell-experimental?
15:40:16 <Igloo> I assumed it was a test package for the repository
15:40:50 <SyntaxPolice> Heffalump: I think it is a test package, but it might also have the makefile version for building haskell junk, not sure. Colin put it in there when he was setting up the repository.
15:41:04 <SyntaxPolice> I'll ask him about it.
15:43:17 <Heffalump> Colin?
15:44:05 <dark> Heffalump: The c in cdbs :)
15:44:08 <SyntaxPolice> Heffalump: colin walters is one of the primary authors of CDBS, and mini-dinstall and is af riend of mine :)
15:44:34 <SyntaxPolice> Heffalump: he takes care of www.syntaxpolice.org for me.  he had to mess with the haskell-experimental repo a lot because we're running SELinux and it was a little tricky :)
15:44:55 <Heffalump> ah :-)
15:51:17 <phubuh_> SyntaxPolice: in which section should i put buddha?
15:52:01 <phubuh_> devel, i suppose
15:54:02 <SyntaxPolice> yeah, sounds good.
15:54:27 <SyntaxPolice> I've really wanted to play w/ buddah for a while. hat never works for me, but I don't thinkt hat buddah handles the extentions I need :(
15:56:16 <Heffalump> someone just suggested I might need vaccines to go to Sweden :-)
15:56:24 <phubuh_> hah
15:56:45 <Heffalump> I think they may have missed my statement that it's Sweden I'm going to.
15:56:51 <SyntaxPolice> Heffalump: is there any merit to this suggestions.
15:56:59 <Heffalump> I should hope not...
15:57:03 <SyntaxPolice> s /s./?
15:57:10 <SyntaxPolice> good :)
15:57:57 <phubuh_> i live there, and i'm not vaccinated, so i'm hoping with you
15:58:07 <Heffalump> :-)
15:58:18 <Heffalump> presumably you've had things like polio, diptheria and tetanus, though?
15:58:28 <Heffalump> and probably measles, mumps, rubella etc.
15:59:11 <phubuh_> i'm really bad with disease names, but i think i've just been vaccinated against that stuff you get when you get bitten by animals
15:59:14 <phubuh_> no, not rabies :-)
15:59:19 <dark> tetanus?
15:59:25 <dark> You can get it from rusty nails, too.
15:59:52 <phubuh_> yeah, that's probably it. we call it stelkramp, which translates literally as `stiff cramps' or something
15:59:56 <Heffalump> polio and diptheria have been pretty much wiped out now, but I think I was vaccinated against them as a kid just in case
16:00:02 <Heffalump> yes, that's tetanus
16:00:06 <Heffalump> otherwise know as lockjaw
16:00:08 <SyntaxPolice> can you get it from excitable haskellhackers?
16:00:40 * SyntaxPolice just hopes that SimonPJ has been vaccinated because we all seem to get whatever he gets ;)
16:01:12 <Heffalump> :-
16:01:13 <Heffalump> )
16:02:11 <SyntaxPolice> OK outta here. peace all
16:02:13 * SyntaxPolice &
16:02:20 <Igloo> I think we should be more worried about catching things from the MLers or Erlangers  :-)
16:02:47 <SyntaxPolice> hehe. I plan to keep my bubble between myself and "those people"
16:02:52 <SyntaxPolice> OK I'm really gone now
16:02:54 * SyntaxPolice &
16:02:57 <phubuh_> bye
16:03:31 <Heffalump> the Schemers are worse.
16:03:48 <Heffalump> there's a bunch of rabid Schemers who go to ICFP.
16:04:26 <dark> I'm about to go to Oslo where I can share diseases with Debian people from all over the world.
16:04:28 <Riastradh> Like who?
16:04:39 <Riastradh> (addressed to Heffalump)
16:04:43 <Heffalump> Matthias Felleisen would be the obvious one.
16:05:07 <Riastradh> Is he rabidly anti-Haskell or something?
16:05:30 <Heffalump> well, he seemed that way at the AFP summer school, but that was probably only because it was Haskell-dominated
16:05:57 <Riastradh> AFP?
16:06:12 <Heffalump> Advanced Functional Programming
16:06:50 * Igloo runs his test and gets a failure indicating...a bug in the test  :-)
16:29:28 <Igloo> Could QC not catch "error foo" in GHC at least?
16:29:50 <hdaume> Igloo: assuming it works in IO
16:30:08 <hdaume> it = QC
16:30:11 <Igloo> QC does, yes
16:30:17 <phubuh_> buddha's makefiles are completely broken
16:30:18 <phubuh_> :(
16:30:40 * Igloo looks through the docs, but I can't imagine it wouldn't do so by default
16:31:43 <Igloo> Ah, verboseCheck rather than quickCheck suffices anyway
16:38:39 <Riastradh> HAH!  I just figured out how to do my handle abstraction stuff!
16:39:07 <Riastradh> class HandleAbs h a a' | h a -> a' where
16:39:16 <Riastradh>     abstract :: HandleAbs h' a' a'' => h' -> h
16:39:25 <Riastradh>     hlPut    :: h -> a -> IO ()
16:39:32 <Riastradh>     hlGet    :: h -> IO a
16:40:09 <Riastradh> a is the type of stuff you put into the handle; a' is the stuff it puts into the handle it was abstracted over.
16:40:21 <hdaume> i think you'll have trouble writing instances for that (but i could be wrong)
16:42:04 <Riastradh> Can a forall have more than one type variable?
16:42:26 <hdaume> sure
16:42:51 <hdaume> most do :).  'fst :: forall a b . (a,b) -> a'
16:45:58 <Igloo> Hurrah! Found a real bug with QC!
16:47:02 <Heffalump> what are you QCing?
16:47:13 <Igloo> A priority queue module
16:48:53 <Riastradh> Er, that's odd -- this line gives a syntax error:
16:48:54 <Riastradh> newtype PairHandle = forall h a'. HandleAbs h String a' => PairHandle h
16:49:24 <hdaume> Igloo: a good one?
16:49:39 <hdaume> you can't have newtypes like that...use data
16:49:48 <Riastradh> Oh.
16:50:08 <hdaume> newtype can't have exitensial types
16:50:14 <Riastradh> Bah.
16:50:50 <hdaume> hdaume can't type either :)
16:51:27 <Igloo> Maximum log n time for each operation I believe (haven't checked properly, but I was thinking about it while writing it), simple (but not as simple as I'd hoped when I started)
16:52:30 <Riastradh> HAH!  It typechecks!
16:52:56 <hdaume> Riastradh: cool :)
16:53:09 <hdaume> Igloo: what implementation?  (obviously a tree of some sort)
16:53:10 * Riastradh runs rings around Igloo and hdaume for saying long ago when he first introduced the idea that it would never typecheck.
16:53:22 <Heffalump> how does it work?
16:53:25 <Heffalump> riastradh: what idea?
16:53:32 <Riastradh> Handle abstractions.

16:57:05 <Heffalump> wdym "the Bool is balanced"?
16:57:09 <hdaume> Igloo: can you think of a simple modification to this structure such that it will hold at most n elements and if you insert an n+1st element it will remove the greatest?
16:57:22 <Igloo> If the Bool is True then the tree is balanced
16:57:43 <Igloo> Where the greatest is the last one that would come out normally?
16:57:49 <Heffalump> so is every operation log time?
16:57:54 <Heffalump> or only on an amortized basis?
16:57:59 <Igloo> Every operation
16:58:14 <Riastradh> hdaume, what do you think?
16:58:17 <Heffalump> because?
16:58:46 <hdaume> Igloo: i need something like a priority queue that only holds like 100 or 1000 elements.  (for concreteness, say the first element is the *least*.)  if you insert an element into a tree for which this element is greater than all the elements in the tree, nothing happens.  otherwise, it gets inserted and the greatest element gets kicked out.
16:58:53 <hdaume> so it only holds the 100 "best" elements at any time
16:59:25 <Igloo> hdaume: So you need a double ended priority queue then...hmmm...
16:59:41 <hdaume> Igloo: yeah, pretty much.  aka a beam :)
17:00:27 <hdaume> Igloo: currently i have this implemented as an array, but then inserting things which are very "good" takes nearly linear time
17:00:33 <Heffalump> igloo: how does your delete operationwork?
17:00:47 * Igloo hopefully mails Heff the source - if you want me to explain then I'll do so in person  :-)
17:02:37 <Igloo> hdaume: Well with this removeal would be O(n) and the normal queue ops would be O(log n)
17:02:47 <Heffalump> so the tree is in-ordered?
17:02:52 <Igloo> As would be the case with pretty much any priority queue
17:03:02 <Igloo> What does in-ordered mean?
17:03:20 <Igloo> It maintains what might be the heap invariant
17:03:30 <Igloo> Where the root of any subtree is <= all its children
17:03:35 * Riastradh grumbles -- just when he figures out his handle abstraction stuff, Igloo has some queue stuff to show.
17:03:43 <Heffalump> in-order traversal is traverse tree=(traverse left subtree),look at node,(traverse right subtree)
17:03:56 <Heffalump> in-ordered = an in-order traversal returns an ordered list
17:03:56 <Igloo> No
17:04:07 <Igloo> Sorry, Riastradh  :-(
17:04:09 <Heffalump> ok, so it's just the heap invariant
17:04:19 <Igloo> Yup
17:04:41 <Heffalump> wht is having Ord such a big deal for you?
17:05:33 <Igloo> If I made it just use < then I'd have to bundle things up when writing Dijkstra using it - or is that not what you meant?
17:05:42 <Heffalump> is it legal for the left and right subtree both to be unbalanced?
17:05:49 <Heffalump> wdym "bundle things up"?
17:06:22 <Igloo> Yes - that's the only way you could have a size 3 tree
17:06:43 <Heffalump> huh?
17:07:04 <Igloo> Well, if you want a PQueue of (Path, Distance) then you'd have to make a datatype for the pair and define Ord on it rather than just sticking in a tuple
17:07:42 <Heffalump> Branch (Branch Leaf 2 Leaf True) 1 (Branch Leaf 3 Leaf True) True
17:07:44 <Igloo> (1 Leaf) 0 (2 Leaf) is the only shape a tree with 3 elements can have
17:07:46 <Heffalump> is size 3 without any unbalancing
17:07:57 <Igloo> Oh, ermm
17:08:00 <Igloo> Size 5 then
17:08:11 <Igloo> No, that's not right either
17:08:21 <Heffalump> oh, when you say "1 bigger", you really mean "precisely one element bigger"?
17:08:26 <Igloo> Yes
17:08:51 <Igloo> Oh, and 5 was right
17:09:36 <Heffalump> oh, right (re the datatype)
17:09:59 <Heffalump> I think it'd have been nice to do that, though.
17:10:30 <Igloo> You mean just using Ord and requiring a datatype for complex things would be better?
17:10:43 <Heffalump> yes.
17:10:46 <Heffalump> better abstraction.
17:10:47 <hdaume> Igloo: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
17:10:50 <hdaume> that's terrible!
17:10:51 <Heffalump> It's what type classes are designed for.
17:11:06 <Heffalump> Admittedly requiring a new datatype is a bit nasty syntactically, but IMO it's the right thing to do (TM)
17:11:16 <hdaume> I might prefer 'minQueue = PQueue (<)' and 'maxQueue = PQUeue (>)'
17:11:28 <hdaume> s/might/much
17:11:31 * hdaume still can't type
17:11:31 * Igloo was tempted having seen the effect on the source, but I agree with hdaume that it does seem uglier
17:12:01 <Heffalump> I guess that's a good reason.
17:12:21 <Heffalump> but I reckon using newtype to get better type checking is nicer.
17:12:54 <hdaume> Heffalump: if we had named instances, then i would agree with you :)
17:13:16 * Igloo will probably change it if I get around to making documentation and pretty metapost pictures for it as it would make it a lot easier to explain
17:15:02 <Heffalump> how would named instances work?
17:15:18 <Heffalump> so are your queues new, or are they the same as something else in the literature?
17:16:03 <Heffalump> hdaume: would they essentially make dictionary passing explicit if you wanted it to be?
17:16:25 <Igloo> No idea
17:17:05 <hdaume> Heffalump: yeah, more or less
17:18:01 <Igloo> Chris Okasaki had something involving fibonacci trees which he also got O(1) insertion with, but I haven't read the details yet
17:18:05 <hdaume> Heffalump: i think of it like: dictionaries are implicit params which are set to the defaults at the top of the program.  however, anywhere within the program you can say 'where ?Ord = MyOrdDict' and then that is used
17:19:13 <Heffalump> right, yeah
17:19:13 <Igloo> But that would affect functions elsewhere that you called...
17:19:31 <hdaume> yeah...there was a thesis on this which would explain it much better than i can :)
17:19:33 <Heffalump> you'd want it do be ?Ord TypeFoo = MyOrdDict
17:19:54 <Heffalump> since dictionaries are tied to (type,class) pairs
17:20:17 <hdaume> Heffalump: yeah yeah, of course
17:21:40 * Igloo skips to the end of the paper and finds he's talking about PQs of PQs
17:24:50 <Pseudonym> Greetings everyone.
17:24:57 <Igloo> Hiya
17:25:12 * Pseudonym just got another hint at how powerful lazy evaluation really is
17:25:19 <Igloo> Oh?
17:25:20 <Pseudonym> Just thought I'd share.
17:25:28 <Pseudonym> Yes, I actually understand codata now.
17:25:28 <Heffalump> igloo: who is?
17:25:33 <Heffalump> oh yes?
17:25:39 <Pseudonym> Yes!  It's very simple.
17:25:44 <Heffalump> so can you explain why OI isn't unsafe?
17:25:48 <Igloo> Okasaki (and I meant binomial trees)
17:25:51 <Pseudonym> No, not yet. :-)
17:25:56 * Pseudonym hasn't got to comonads yet
17:26:08 <Heffalump> so go on then, what's codata?
17:26:14 <Pseudonym> OK, here's codata.
17:26:27 <Pseudonym> We know what universal algebra is.  We use it to construct algebraic data types.
17:26:30 <Riastradh> Darnit, now that Igloo's done, Pseudonym's got to rant about codata and stuff!
17:26:42 * Riastradh goes off to a corner and broods.
17:26:47 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: Don't you have some kind of ignore function on your irc client?
17:27:02 <Heffalump> his problem is that he wants to talk about his handle stuff :-)
17:27:05 <Igloo> Riastradh: I had a quick look but can't remember what we were talking about last time
17:27:06 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, no, the idea is that I'm trying to get my idea _not_ to be ignored.
17:27:15 <Pseudonym> Oh, what's your idea?
17:27:17 * Heffalump is perfectly willing to listen to two things at once, but I'm not particularly interested in handles.
17:27:18 * Pseudonym looks back in the logs
17:27:27 <Riastradh> http://www.bloodandcoffee.net/campbell/code/HandleTrans.hs
17:27:31 <Pseudonym> Actually, Riastradh, this may be relevant for you.
17:27:42 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: define universal algebra?
17:27:43 <Pseudonym> Codata is a great way to design APIs.
17:27:46 <Pseudonym> OK.
17:27:59 <Pseudonym> Universal algebra you use to construct structured data.
17:28:20 <Pseudonym> Basically, you can make anything out of basic types, unit, cartesian product, disjoint union and recursion.
17:28:30 <Heffalump> I understand the concept of inductive datatypes as the fixed point of a functor, if that's what you're going to say.
17:28:44 <Pseudonym> So, for example, using 1 as unit, * as cartesian product and + as disjoint union...
17:28:51 <Pseudonym> No, ignore fixed points of functors for the moment.
17:28:56 <Pseudonym> It's much simpler than this.
17:28:59 <Heffalump> ok, explicit recursion then
17:29:02 <Pseudonym> OK.
17:29:07 <Heffalump> ok, so what's codata?
17:29:10 <Pseudonym> So you can define a list functor as this:
17:29:17 <Pseudonym> list(A) = 1 + (A * list(A))
17:29:20 <Pseudonym> For example.
17:29:24 <Heffalump> (I do have a rough idea, but not a good intuition)
17:29:33 <Pseudonym> Bear with me.  I'm getting there.
17:30:00 <Pseudonym> You can _construct_ an abstract list using a function like this:
17:30:09 <Pseudonym> construct :: 1 + (A * list(A)) -> list(A)
17:30:34 <Pseudonym> This is, in fact, what Haskell constructor functions are.
17:30:36 <Pseudonym> Only disjoint union is implemented as separate injection functions.
17:30:44 <Heffalump> right.
17:31:01 <Pseudonym> However, there's no reason in principle you couldn't do it like this:
17:31:01 <Pseudonym> constructList :: Either () (a, [a]) -> [a]
17:31:01 <Pseudonym> For example.
17:31:08 <Pseudonym> That's "data".
17:31:10 <hdaume> i'm following so far :)
17:31:26 <Pseudonym> "Codata" is its dual.
17:31:34 <Pseudonym> Consider a function like this instead:
17:31:43 <Pseudonym> destrutList :: [a] -> Either () (a,[a])
17:31:50 <Pseudonym> destruct, not destrut
17:32:27 <Heffalump> ok, so inductive datatypes allow pattern matching to discriminate amongst disjoint unions (i.e. destruct things)
17:32:28 <Pseudonym> Coalgebra is used to view types, whereas algebra is used to construct them.
17:32:32 <Heffalump> how does codata allow you to construct things?
17:32:38 <Pseudonym> Well, it doesn't.
17:32:48 <Pseudonym> Just like how algebra doesn't allow you to view things.
17:32:59 <Pseudonym> You need to add pattern matching to the language to allow that.
17:33:12 <Heffalump> ok, so what can you add to coalgebras to allow you to construct things?
17:33:23 <Pseudonym> Ah, well, you can't, by itself.
17:33:47 <Pseudonym> OK, let's look at a concrete example.
17:34:00 <Pseudonym> Take a stream of Chars, like reading from a file or pipe.
17:34:15 <Pseudonym> Coalgebras give you a way to describe this.
17:34:23 <Pseudonym> Whereas algebras give you a way to describe writing.
17:34:52 <Pseudonym> Remember that in, say, the OI monad, you need an initial OI object to come from "outside".
17:34:53 <Heffalump> but in practice implementations of algebras give you a way to describe reading too
17:35:02 <Heffalump> what practical use are coalgebras, in that context?
17:35:03 <Pseudonym> Not always!
17:35:18 <Pseudonym> The IO monad, for example, doesn't give you a way to peer inside it.
17:35:38 <Pseudonym> Just like the OI comonad doesn't give you a way to construct it.
17:35:39 <Heffalump> but it gives you getChar
17:35:59 <Heffalump> which if you view IO as a big state monad, is functionally equivalent to giving you a stream.
17:36:11 <Pseudonym> Yes, it's equivalent.
17:36:17 <Pseudonym> It's dual, in fact.
17:36:23 <Heffalump> dual != equivalent
17:36:25 <Pseudonym> But it's not identical.
17:36:41 <Pseudonym> By "equivalent", I mean it has equivalent expressive power.
17:36:48 * Igloo is lost as to where this came from and where it's going
17:37:08 <Heffalump> I'm happy to accept that coalgebras give you a different structure of looking at the world to algebras. I still haven't seen any real uses for them, though.
17:38:03 <Pseudonym> OK, here's an example, from imperative (ick!) programming.
17:38:42 <Pseudonym> Sorry, had to talk to my daughter on the phone.
17:38:47 <Pseudonym> Didn't get a reply. :-)
17:38:52 <Pseudonym> OK...
17:38:57 <hdaume> :)
17:39:03 <Pseudonym> From imperative programminc, consider the stream example again.
17:39:26 <Pseudonym> destructList :: [Char] -> Either () (Char,[Char])
17:39:50 <Pseudonym> You want to return either an end-of-stream, or a char plus the rest of the stream.
17:40:32 <Pseudonym> Now there are several ways to return a disjoint union, but there's a fairly standard way to do this.
17:41:14 <Pseudonym> Namely, give one function which returns some kind of boolean flag, and the other of which returns a char, if the flag is true (or, without loss of generality, false).
17:41:32 <Pseudonym> e.g. feof() and fgetchar() in C.
17:42:24 <Pseudonym> Coalgebras are particularly useful in analysing transition systems like this, where you move from state to state, taking inputs and returning outputs.
17:42:41 <Heffalump> because?
17:43:16 <Pseudonym> OK, I haven't gotten that far yet.  I'm not sure why you'd pick coalgebras over algebras.
17:43:21 <Pseudonym> They are dual, after all.
17:43:47 <Heffalump> dual just means you can translate theorems from one setting to the other
17:43:52 <Pseudonym> Right.
17:43:53 <Heffalump> it doesn't mean equivalent
17:44:03 <Pseudonym> Which means you can also translate algorithms from one setting to the other.
17:44:11 <Heffalump> but they might do completely different things
17:44:26 <Pseudonym> Well you want a semantics-preserving mapping.
17:44:33 <Pseudonym> That's coalgebra 201, not 101.
17:44:40 <Heffalump> but there's no reason duality would give you that
17:45:20 <Pseudonym> One reason why lazy evaluation is powerful is that you can represent codata directly as data.
17:45:32 <Pseudonym> You can have an infinite lazy stream, for example.
17:46:10 <Pseudonym> You can just read in a file as a lazy stream and evaluate as much as you like.
17:46:13 <Pseudonym> e.g. hGetContents
17:46:36 <Pseudonym> In the real world, of course, there are exceptions to take into account, so the coalgebra probably looks more like this:
17:46:54 <Pseudonym> data Stream a = EOS | Cons a (Stream a) | Exception IOException
17:48:25 <Heffalump> does universal algebra take account of bottom values?
17:48:45 <Pseudonym> I don't know.
17:49:03 <Heffalump> ISTR not.
17:49:17 <Heffalump> So actually Haskell's datatypes may be closer to codata than data :-)
17:49:23 <Pseudonym> Well, yes and no.
17:49:39 <Heffalump> anyway, I'm going to bed
17:49:43 <Pseudonym> OK, night.
17:49:53 <Heffalump> I'm sure you'll let me know if you find a killer application for codata :-)
17:50:05 <Pseudonym> Well, we've already got them.
17:50:08 <Pseudonym> That's the thing.
17:50:10 <hdaume> ISTR = ?
17:50:21 <Pseudonym> We've been using codata in our abstract data types for years and just haven't realised it.
17:50:39 <Igloo> I Seem To Remember
17:50:55 <hdaume> ah
17:53:00 <Pseudonym> Oh!  Duh!
17:53:06 <Pseudonym> I see why comonads are unsafe!
17:53:20 <Pseudonym> Or at least the way they were formulated in the paper.
17:53:41 <Pseudonym> getCharOI modifies the state of the stream, so its type should properly be:
17:53:43 <Igloo> Errr, < Heffalump> so can you explain why OI isn't unsafe?
17:53:49 <Pseudonym> getCharOI :: OI -> (Char,OI)
17:53:56 <Pseudonym> I think you need linear types.
17:54:25 <Pseudonym> Right.  I couldn't at the time.  The reason is that OI _is_ unsafe.
17:54:58 <Igloo> OK
18:15:01 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, how is that much different from a stream wrapped in a state monad, which is what IO generally is?
18:15:21 <Pseudonym> It's not.
18:15:24 <Pseudonym> :-)
18:15:28 <Riastradh> Er, so, what's the point?
18:15:52 <Pseudonym> Well, if it _were_ correct to just use this:
18:16:01 <Pseudonym> getCharOI :: OI -> Char
18:16:13 <Riastradh> ...but that's unsafe.
18:16:14 <Pseudonym> Then the theory is that might be more convenient.
18:16:19 <Pseudonym> Right, it is unsafe.
18:16:42 * Riastradh does agree that it's kind of a bother to have to wrap everything in an IO monad just to get a single character of input or something.
18:16:44 <Pseudonym> The author of the comonad paper didn't realise this, I think.
18:17:02 <Pseudonym> Getting a single character of input is easy.
18:17:09 <Pseudonym> Getting a second character is much harder. :-)
18:17:23 <Riastradh> How do you get the single character without wrapping everything in IO?
18:17:30 <Pseudonym> That's easy.
18:17:33 <Pseudonym> singleChar :: Char
18:17:45 <Pseudonym> It's just as referentially transparent as getArgs.
18:17:51 <Riastradh> And singleChar is defined as...?
18:18:10 <Pseudonym> Well it's a builtin, obviously.
18:18:19 <Pseudonym> It returns the first character from stdin.
18:18:33 <Pseudonym> Subsequent calls also return the first character from stdin.
18:18:33 <Riastradh> And is it defined in Haskell?
18:18:43 <Pseudonym> No.
18:18:47 <Riastradh> Problem!
18:19:07 <Pseudonym> No, I could implement it easily, so long as you're prepared not to use getChar and hGetChar.
18:19:17 <Riastradh> Implement it!
18:19:23 <Pseudonym> And you're happy with only the first character from stdin.
18:19:30 <Riastradh> Yup.
18:19:37 <Pseudonym> Why do you only want one character?
18:19:42 <Riastradh> It's an example.
18:19:43 <Pseudonym> As a matter of interest?
18:19:49 <Riastradh> Yup.
18:19:50 <Pseudonym> Here goes, then:
18:20:00 <Pseudonym> {-# NOINLINE singleChar #-}
18:20:03 <Pseudonym> singelChar :: Char
18:20:12 <Pseudonym> singleChar = unsafePerformIO getChar
18:20:15 <Pseudonym> There you go.
18:20:20 <Riastradh> Yuck.
18:20:27 <Pseudonym> Well it should be a builtin.
18:20:40 <Pseudonym> Like I said.
18:20:42 <Riastradh> Another example: getting a random number in the middle of your code.
18:21:00 <Pseudonym> Again, that's okay so long as you don't mind it being the _same_ random number every time.
18:21:07 <Riastradh> I _do_ mind that, though.
18:21:15 <Pseudonym> Well you're stuck then.
18:21:30 <Pseudonym> Similarl,y, singleChar is fine so long as you don't mind getting the same Char every time.
18:21:49 <Pseudonym> It's perfectly referentially transparent.
18:22:07 <Pseudonym> It can be different every time you run the program, of course.
18:22:41 * Riastradh departs to watch a Monty Python episode.
18:23:28 <Pseudonym> Excellent plan!
18:33:39 <steveh> exit
18:33:44 <steveh> wrong window :)
21:41:09 <Pseudonym> Damn that's a good quote from LtU.
21:41:17 <Pseudonym> It seems that any language tends to develop an implicit theory of what it is most likely to be used for and how it will be used through a combination of semantic/syntactic design, bundled functionality, and sociological forces.
21:41:31 <o3> Pseudonym: LtU?
21:41:38 <Pseudonym> http://lambda.weblogs.com/
21:41:57 <Pseudonym> One of the better weblog sites out there.
21:42:07 <o3> nod, i read it daily
21:42:22 <Pseudonym> You didn't recognise the acronym, though. :-)
21:42:39 <o3> oh!  *slaps head*
21:42:51 <lilith> heh
21:42:51 <Pseudonym> Maybe it's just a #haskell thing, that acronym.
21:43:31 <Pseudonym> Ain't it the truth, though.  That's why we talk of "systems programming languages" and "scripting languages" and so on.
21:43:33 <lilith> LtU doesn't ring a bell for me either
21:44:14 <o3> Pseudonym: which article is the quote from?
21:44:26 <Pseudonym> The one on the Neal Stephenson talk.
21:44:34 <Pseudonym> Someone mentioned this in the followup.
