02:49:52 <Heffalump> morning Marvin
02:50:16 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
02:50:25 <code> Hey Marvin--
02:50:31 <Heffalump> ah, shapr, you might understand lambdabot code
02:50:34 <shapr> yes?
02:50:48 <shapr> I hope so
02:51:11 <Heffalump> am I right in saying that there's a reader thread and a writer thread, and a main event loop called mainloop in Main.hs
02:51:18 <shapr> yup
02:51:49 <Heffalump> should ircRead in mainloop block until there's some message available?
02:51:54 <shapr> Pseudonym is the real expert
02:52:18 <shapr> I would guess so
02:52:26 <Heffalump> well, it doesn't seem to.
02:52:39 <Heffalump> In fact, it behaves quite bizarrely, is there some use of unsafeInterleaveIO somewhere?
02:52:42 <shapr> has that happened only since the latest cvs checkin?
02:52:50 <Heffalump> no idea, I only checked it out at the weekend
02:53:30 <shapr> polli restructured the code recently
02:53:37 <shapr> the typeclasses update is spiffy
02:53:41 <Marvin--> morning
02:53:43 <shapr> I think he also changed the mainloop
02:54:04 <Heffalump> typeclasses update?
02:54:20 <shapr> yes, lambdabot plugins are much spiffier now
02:54:23 <Heffalump> the thing is, if I try to print out the msg read in the mainloop, the bot crashes with an error from hGetChar
02:54:41 <shapr> if you turn on verbose in BotConfig 
02:54:49 <shapr> you should see messages that aren't caught by a plugin
02:55:03 <Heffalump> I don't want to do that, I just want to insert my own random bits of code where I feel like :-)
02:55:16 <Heffalump> it seems strange to me that trying to print out something read in an IO monad causes it to die
02:55:39 <Heffalump> (the reason I'm actually trying to do this is to catch errors in plugins)
02:55:54 <Heffalump> but I can't figure out where to put the exception handler
02:56:39 <shapr> a week ago, you could have put the plugin exception handler in the one place where plugins got called
02:56:50 <Heffalump> well, I did that.
02:56:57 <Heffalump> it didn't catch anything
02:57:24 <Heffalump> assuming allCallbacks is where they get called from.
02:57:28 <shapr> with the new code, you get to sew your signal handler from a plugin into the real deal
02:57:42 <Heffalump> ??
02:57:47 <Heffalump> it's not a signal handler, it's an exception handler
02:58:01 <Heffalump> I need to wrap the handler around something that might produce an exception
02:58:05 <shapr> just a moment, let me find the exact line numbers
02:58:25 <shapr> lambdabot has been refactored into a dispatch table
02:58:44 <shapr> any IRC signal received gets dispatched to anyone who registered for that signal
02:58:58 <shapr> have you seen BaseModule.hs ?
03:00:17 <shapr> bonjour n3d 
03:00:21 <n3d> bjour
03:01:04 <shapr> Heffalump: I see what you mean, there's not an obvious single place to put an exception handler
03:01:28 <Marvin--> shapr: I think the issue isn't where to put the exception handler, the issue is that the damn thing crashes when he adds code in an IO monad
03:01:40 <Marvin--> that's a real Issue in my opinion
03:01:44 <shapr> heh, I agree
03:01:46 <Heffalump> well, there's two issues
03:01:56 <Heffalump> the crash is more significant since it proves I have no clue what's going on
03:02:20 <shapr> can I get the code that crashes?
03:02:26 <Heffalump> errm, probably
03:02:28 <shapr> I may be able to figure it out
03:02:39 <Heffalump> I need to put some other stuff back how it was
03:03:38 * Marvin-- hates X
03:03:43 * shapr sends coffee to Marvin-- 
03:06:09 <Marvin--> when I got to the office today, X wasn't responding, I ssh:ed in from another box and found that the XFree86 process was chewing up 75% cpu or so
03:06:16 <shapr> scary
03:06:29 <Marvin--> coffee sounds like a plan
03:06:36 <Marvin--> oh, and I have to buy a new bike :-/
03:06:43 <shapr> what happened to your old bike?
03:08:52 <shapr> I can unicycle almost the length of a city block without falling over now
03:08:56 * shapr bounces happily
03:09:16 <shapr> I'm nearly to the point of sustainable unicycling.
03:10:23 <Marvin--> I handed it in for service when I went to Norway, they called me Tuesday or something and said that it needed extensive repairs
03:10:28 <Marvin--> as in, 3k5 SEK
03:11:03 <shapr> 3500 sek?
03:11:14 <shapr> you can buy a nice new bike for that
03:11:49 <Marvin--> exactly
03:11:57 <Marvin--> thus, I have to buy a new bike :-/
03:12:39 <shapr> unicycles are cheap ;-)

03:52:13 <shapr> what are syntactic macros? is that the opposite of hygienic macros?
03:52:43 <Heffalump> yeah, probably
03:52:47 <Heffalump> #define is a syntactic macro
03:53:12 <shapr> someone on the pragprog list said that Haskell didn't feel like it would need syntactic macros
03:53:47 <Heffalump> people tend to use them to deal with differences between implementations, I think
03:53:59 <shapr> oh
03:54:02 <kosmikus> Heffalump: I've been stuck in a German train for ~4 hours yesterday; so I'm glad that I actually *made* it back to .nl ... OTOH, yes, I might even prefer .nl to .de at the moment.
03:54:21 <Heffalump> :-)
03:54:35 <Heffalump> I thought trains on the continent were supposed to be really reliable compared to the evil broken British system?
03:55:06 <kosmikus> Don't trust German railways at the moment ...
03:55:37 <kosmikus> Yesterday, it wasn't completely their fault, but from my last 8 long-distance trips, I had 5 times a delay of more than 60 minutes.

03:58:50 <elmex> shapr: afaik
03:59:53 <shapr> elmex: ah, I see you already told me that
04:00:19 <shapr> elmex: in my experience, sourceforge dedicates more bandwidth to developers, and less to anonymous users
04:00:31 <elmex> shapr: oh, ok :)
04:00:32 <shapr> anonymous cvs users, that is
04:00:35 <elmex> i know
04:00:41 <elmex> _really_ bad to worse
04:01:15 <shapr> I'd like to try darcs
04:01:19 <shapr> but I haven't gotten around to it yet
04:01:25 <elmex> well, i nearlyt erased my source in an accident.... could find them in the backup-files of vim... but.. uh... i should really put that code in a cvs
04:01:33 <shapr> yah, good idea
04:02:23 <shapr> elmex: want me to add you to haskell-libs as a developer?
04:02:29 <shapr> then you could stick your source code in there

04:06:30 <elmex> oh, ok\
04:06:53 <shapr> I know darcs allows a more distributed repo
04:07:08 <shapr> does anyone else here have a darcs repo online?

04:07:33 <elmex> thank
04:07:34 <elmex> sd
04:07:47 <shapr> sure
04:08:00 <elmex> thought about subversion?
04:08:14 <shapr> darcs is written in Haskell :-)
04:08:32 <shapr> that's much of why I want to try it

04:30:55 <shapr> I just read Tad Williams latest book, it's pretty spiffy
04:30:59 <Marvin--> let's just say that I've read his Belgariad stuff because I didn't know any better
04:31:03 <Marvin--> and then I found real fantasy

04:31:10 <Heffalump> oh, true, I get free use of the DL through the uni

04:31:19 <shapr> Heffalump: lucky you
04:31:48 <shapr> I wanted to subscribe to the JFP, since I don't have access to that either.
04:31:57 <shapr> I think I should start a JFP e-'zine
04:31:59 <Marvin--> xkb: some of Jordan's books were okay, I like Feist a lot even though it's pretty simplistic, recently I've gotten really really fond of George RR Martin's books
04:32:08 <shapr> yah, Feist is fun
04:32:12 <shapr> Jordan is spiffy
04:32:15 <xkb> Marvin-- : what do you think of early goodkind?
04:32:25 <shapr> Terry Pratchett is the best, imho
04:32:26 <Heffalump> a JFP e'zine?
04:32:37 <xkb> shapr : yeah.. I must agree
04:32:38 <xkb> :D
04:32:40 <shapr> Heffalump: you know e-zine?
04:32:44 <Marvin--> shapr: *some* of Jordan's books were good, now it's just repetitive
04:32:47 <Heffalump> yeah, but what would it have in it?
04:32:56 <shapr> Marvin--: I haven't read crown of daggers yet, or whatever that's really called
04:33:01 <shapr> before that, it's spiffy
04:33:33 <Marvin--> xkb: I actually just recently read Wizard's First Rule, and I guess it was okay, decent "quest fantasy", but I've been recommended not to continue reading that series

04:36:27 <shapr> Heffalump: for example, connect the Analysis Patterns section on measuring and quantities to Pseudonym's code in haskell-libs that does autoconversion
04:37:03 <shapr> Heffalump: or maybe do an analysis of type-safety in runtime loading with GHC
04:37:29 <shapr> figure out whether runtime loading can be HM type-safe
04:37:56 <Heffalump> that's easy, it can't be unless you trust both ends
04:38:11 <shapr> quick, write a page and a half about it ;-)
04:38:20 <shapr> we could post it on HaWiki even
04:38:33 <Heffalump> it's not worth a page and a half...
04:38:39 <shapr> ok, a paragraph
04:38:43 <Heffalump> actually, it depends on precisely how you define type safety.
04:38:51 <shapr> see now it gets interestin
04:38:51 <Heffalump> if you mean no segfaults, then it's doable
04:38:51 <shapr> g
04:39:01 <elmex> :)
04:39:02 <Heffalump> if you mean "no runtime type errors", then it's not
04:39:07 <shapr> why not?
04:39:13 * Marvin-- wrote some stuff in his hws-wp report about this
04:39:20 <shapr> oh really?
04:39:23 <Heffalump> because I can always make a module with the wrong types in it
04:39:39 <shapr> see, write some tiny code that shows this
04:39:48 <shapr> then we'll have a page and a half for the zine
04:39:48 <Marvin--> shapr: I think so
04:39:56 <shapr> Marvin--: cool, I'll read through it.
04:40:23 <shapr> Heffalump: I think we could make a zine just from getting a bunch of us to come up with questions, and then we all get to write answers
04:41:04 <Heffalump> it wouldn't really be at the level of academic papers, though
04:41:09 <shapr> for example, Koen did the poorman's concurrency monad, could that be refined into transparent paralellization of monads?
04:41:18 <shapr> Heffalump: sure, but that's why it's a zine, right?
04:42:21 <shapr> interesting stuff about functional programming that doesn't cost money to read
04:42:33 <Marvin--> shapr: heh, don't mention that paper to him, he's very embarassed about it
04:42:47 <shapr> why?
04:42:49 <Heffalump> Marvin--: how come?
04:43:58 <Marvin--> Heffalump: I don't recall, I think it's a paper he wrote very early in his Haskell career, and that he now thinks there are waaaay better ways of implementing it
04:44:09 <learning_haskell> Where can I find good soure code to analyse ?
04:45:02 * Marvin-- reads unicode reports
04:45:22 <shapr> ok, I'm registered for ICFP and I have hotel confirmation numbers, yay!
04:45:42 <Marvin--> "Unicode Standard Annex #15"
04:49:50 <Igloo> Which hotel, shapr?
04:57:25 <xkb> learning_haskell : you can check sf.net for examples
05:01:12 * Marvin-- goes "guh" at unicode, and goes for lunch
05:01:49 <shapr> Igloo: hotel uppsala
05:02:06 <Igloo> Ah, cool, same as us I think
05:02:15 <shapr> yay, hotel hack parties
05:03:26 <Igloo> lol
05:03:57 <elmex> why does haskell not know unicode?
05:04:24 <shapr> Igloo: should I bring a hub? or do you guys have wireless?
05:05:39 * Igloo doesn't have a laptop
05:06:05 <Igloo> I'm toying with the possibility with getting one before going, but I think I'll probably end up not doing so
05:08:35 <kosmikus> shapr: you got a "number" for hotel uppsala?
05:08:41 <shapr> kosmikus: yes, confirmation number
05:08:45 <kosmikus> hmmm
05:08:50 <shapr> did you?
05:08:51 <kosmikus> did I do something wrong, then?
05:08:53 <kosmikus> no
05:09:19 <Igloo> We did too
05:09:31 <shapr> Igloo: you got a confirmation number?
05:09:35 <Igloo> Yup
05:10:04 <shapr> kosmikus: I've never done this before, so I'm not sure.
05:10:19 <shapr> it does sound like you would need the confirmation number to get your rooms when you show up.
05:10:27 <kosmikus> how did you make the reservation?
05:10:51 <shapr> I called them, said I was with the PLI 2003 conference, and that I wanted romos for the nights of August 24-27
05:11:00 <shapr> er "rooms"
05:11:24 <shapr> actually, I said I wanted to reserve rooms
05:11:51 <shapr> so the first girl asked me if I actually meant the dance 2003 conference ;-)
05:11:59 <kosmikus> I wrote a mail, and got a reply confirming that they had a room for me, but without a number
05:12:12 <shapr> I dunno
05:12:44 <shapr> like I said, I've never done this before :-)
05:12:59 <kosmikus> at least, if everything works out okay, I'll be at the same hotel, too :)
05:13:05 <shapr> yay
05:13:09 <shapr> serious hack party
05:13:42 <shapr> now if only we could do the ICFP contest again with half of #haskell in the same place :-)
05:14:11 <kosmikus> my girlfriend might have slight objections, but who knows -- she can program in Haskell ;)
05:14:37 * shapr grins
05:15:00 <reffie> icfp?
05:15:12 <shapr> @fact icfp
05:15:13 <lambdabot> International Conference on Functional Programming, http://www.cs.luc.edu/icfp/
05:15:19 <reffie> ah
05:15:37 <shapr> are you a professional functional programmer?
05:15:42 <shapr> not that I am ;-)
05:16:19 <shapr> I'm a wannabe professional functional programmer.
05:16:27 <elmex> define(quake3,syscmd(quake3.exe))
05:16:28 <elmex> ops
05:16:35 <elmex> wrong window :))
05:16:37 <elmex> (irssi)
05:16:42 <kosmikus> when are you a professional functional programmer?
05:16:53 <shapr> kosmikus: when you get money to write functional programs?
05:16:57 <elmex> kosmikus: never
05:16:59 <reffie> hen you get paid?
05:17:01 <shapr> hm, I've done that once, I guess I do qualify.
05:17:02 <reffie> w
05:17:17 <kosmikus> yes, but does getting paid as a PhD student count?
05:17:31 <reffie> why would anyone want to be a professional functional programmer?
05:17:41 <kosmikus> good question
05:18:57 <shapr> reffie: because it's more fun than being a professional procedural programmer
05:19:04 <shapr> this is just my opinion of course 
05:20:51 <shapr> oh, I'll have a colobox by the end of the week, yay
05:20:52 <reffie> let me rephrase that
05:21:04 <reffie> why would anyone want to be  a professional programmer?
05:21:34 <shapr> because programming is the most fun you can have by yourself
05:21:37 <shapr> once again, imho
05:21:59 <shapr> so getting paid to have fun is good
05:22:15 <reffie> well
05:22:17 <reffie> [14:21] <shapr> because programming is the most fun you can have by yourself
05:22:31 <reffie> that's a _HUGE_ lie :P
05:22:45 <shapr> from my viewpoint it's not.
05:22:47 <Igloo> What's the opposite of preaching to the converted?
05:22:56 <shapr> Igloo: hostile audience ;-)
05:23:24 <reffie> shapr you dont like mastErbation? :D
05:23:52 <shapr> suffice it to say that masterbation is not as much as programming for all people ;-)
05:24:19 <reffie> heh
05:24:51 <shapr> seriously though, it's like comparing counterstrike and programming
05:25:04 <shapr> after you've won or lost a game of counterstrike, what do you have to show for it?
05:25:11 <shapr> flashes of pleasure?
05:25:26 <shapr> after you've written some code, it's still there, and can continue to work for you
05:25:34 <shapr> I wrote the @yow command for lambdabot 
05:25:35 <shapr> @yow
05:25:36 <lambdabot> If this is the DATING GAME I want to know your FAVORITE PLANET!  Do I
05:25:36 <lambdabot>  get th' MICROWAVE MOPED?
05:26:50 <shapr> comparing time put in to enjoyment received, the @yow command beats any game of counterstrike I've ever played
05:27:16 <reffie> what does @yow do?
05:27:31 <shapr> it give a random quotation from Zippy The Pinhead
05:27:53 <reffie> heh
05:28:06 <reffie> is there a mod_haskell?
05:28:09 * earthy would classify Kosmikus as professional Haskell programmer. :)
05:28:10 <reffie> [for apache?]
05:28:10 <shapr> yup
05:28:19 <reffie> is it good? :P
05:28:37 <shapr> I haven't tried it.
05:28:50 <shapr> I've heard good things about it.
05:28:56 * earthy is jealous of kosmikus BTW... a girlfriend that knows how to program in a functional language...
05:29:03 * shapr grins
05:29:06 <reffie> do you only program in haskell, shapr?
05:29:36 <shapr> no, I also program in Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, and some other stuff I can't think of at the moment.
05:29:46 <elmex> evil
05:29:50 <elmex> java? js???
05:29:52 <elmex> uhg
05:29:57 * elmex runs
05:30:01 <shapr> I've dabbled in various other languages as well.
05:30:09 <shapr> oh I agree, Java is the COBOL of the future.
05:30:16 <earthy> shapr programs. period. ;)
05:30:17 <reffie> c? c++?
05:30:22 <shapr> JavaScript is pretty cool, but viciously non-standard
05:30:29 <shapr> reffie: I've done some C, but I didn't like it much.
05:30:41 <shapr> it's like building buildings with sand.
05:30:52 <earthy> ah, sandsculptures. great stuff. ;)
05:30:54 <reffie> heh.
05:31:12 <shapr> earthy: yes, fun at the beach, when done for entertainment
05:31:17 <shapr> but not a way to make a living ;-)
05:31:30 <earthy> shapr: well... it depends :)
05:31:34 <reffie> but so many things are made in c!
05:31:47 <shapr> that's true, I'm able to work in C, but I've never actually written anything useful with it.
05:31:52 <earthy> I wouldn't want to have written some of the hardwaredrivers I've written in anything but C...
05:31:54 <reffie> [for example, your operating system]
05:32:22 <shapr> I've hacked my kernel to add support for the IDE in my chipset
05:32:34 <shapr> but like I said, it wasn't much fun
05:32:57 <earthy> you've never added morse-coded output over a LED to an embedded system?
05:33:06 <shapr> nope, I haven't
05:33:07 <earthy> damn, you've been missing out, dude! :)
05:33:11 * shapr grins
05:33:20 <shapr> someday you'll have to show me what I've been missing
05:33:33 <shapr> next time I come to visit the Low Country
05:34:07 <earthy> unfortunately I can't show that stuff... as it's propietary and I don't have access to it any longer.
05:34:14 <shapr> aw, that sucks
05:34:37 <earthy> but, walk in to any Greenpeace office and ask for their greenbox... ;)
05:34:54 <shapr> reffie: what languages do you use?
05:34:54 <earthy> (if they already have one)
05:35:16 <shapr> I wonder if they have a Greenpeace office in Norrbotten
05:35:29 <reffie> shapr c/c++, and lately, ruby.
05:35:44 <reffie> but i've done perl, php, asm, blaj blah blah
05:36:09 <shapr> oh, I used to do perl, and I've done some php, they weren't really my style
05:36:13 <shapr> I did asm looong ago
05:36:26 <shapr> on my 8086
05:36:30 <reffie> heh
05:36:33 <reffie> old skool
05:36:55 <shapr> yah, I had a bunch 16k chips to press into my motherboard
05:38:33 <shapr> reffie: so, if you don't want to be a professional programmer, what do you want to be?
05:39:17 <reffie> i'm not sure
05:39:25 <reffie> professional wanker? :D
05:39:39 <shapr> from my experience, women are more fun.
05:39:45 <reffie> yeah
05:39:46 <opet> reffie: ah, poltics
05:39:54 <reffie> hah.
05:39:56 * dnm ponders
05:39:57 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: hey, you awake yet?
05:40:05 <shapr> hi dnm!
05:40:27 <shapr> how's the great southwest?
05:41:29 <dnm> shapr: Hi!
05:41:36 <dnm> shapr: Wouldn't know!
05:41:47 <dnm> I suppose it's fine.
05:41:52 <shapr> am I confused again?
05:41:56 <shapr> I thought you were in the southwest USA?
05:41:58 <dnm> Haven't heard anything about it.
05:42:04 <dnm> Nope. San Francisco.
05:42:12 <dnm> Southwest would be like Phoenix.
05:42:19 <dnm> San Francisco is just "west"
05:42:28 <dnm> We're not exactly Northwest, but we're close.
05:42:30 <shapr> maybe I'm thinking of the Seattle point of view
05:43:05 <dnm> SF doesn't identify well with southwest culture anyway, though other parts of california inland and down towards the south do
05:43:19 <dnm> Death Valley is pretty "southwest"
05:44:32 * Marvin-- back
05:45:05 <dnm> So I just had this epiphany.
05:45:36 <shapr> tell us about it
05:46:40 <dnm> It's not Haskell-related.
05:47:01 <dnm> It's just this musical awakening I had about a project I'm now dying to do.
05:47:32 <shapr> well, no one else is saying anything...
05:49:58 <reffie> yeah
05:50:12 <dnm> I'll refrain from mentioning more about it here for now. I want to talk with a few other people first to see if it's something actually worth doing.
05:50:33 <dnm> Anyhoo, who's doing interesting things in Haskell today? Also, has anyone used Haskore?
05:50:49 <shapr> yes, Haskore is nifty
05:50:53 <shapr> and very easy to learn/use as well
05:51:20 <shapr> I used it to play around with canons from GEB
05:51:34 <reffie> what is haskore?
05:51:48 <shapr> @fact haskore
05:51:49 <lambdabot> Nothing
05:51:51 <shapr> hmm
05:51:57 <reffie> :P
05:52:07 <shapr> @fact haskore http://www.haskell.org/haskore/
05:52:09 <lambdabot> set haskore to http://www.haskell.org/haskore/
05:52:30 <shapr> @fact haskore The Haskore Computer Music System
05:52:31 <lambdabot> set haskore to The Haskore Computer Music System
05:52:38 <earthy> @haskore
05:52:38 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "haskore", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:52:42 <earthy> @fact haskore
05:52:42 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskore/, The Haskore Computer Music System
05:52:51 <earthy> a, 'kay, that's how it works then.
05:53:14 <Heffalump> @fact Heffalump Ganesh Sittampalam, http://www.ox.compsoc.net/~ganesh/
05:53:15 <lambdabot> set heffalump to Ganesh Sittampalam, http://www.ox.compsoc.net/~ganesh/
05:53:22 <shapr> @fact shapr
05:53:23 <lambdabot> Shae Erisson
05:53:34 <shapr> I don't really have a website
05:59:28 * earthy grins at the heffalumps.org personality test
06:01:12 <dnm> Heh heh
06:02:47 * Heffalump wonders if anyone has prepared a paper for TOPLAS and can explain why LaTeX is whinging at me
06:03:07 <Marvin--> TOPLESS?
06:03:59 * shapr grins
06:04:10 <shapr> Marvin--: wadler is the main attraction there, of course
06:04:27 <kosmikus> Heffalump: no, but what's the problem?
06:04:50 <Marvin--> I don't know what it is
06:05:22 <Heffalump> ! Undefined control sequence.
06:05:22 <Heffalump> \pages ->\realpageref 
06:05:22 <Heffalump>                       {@firstpg}--\realpageref {@lastpg}
06:05:59 <Heffalump> this happens even with their example document, so obviously something has changed in the behaviour of something in LaTeX sometime since they wrote it
06:06:08 <kosmikus> ah
06:06:09 <kosmikus> URL
06:06:12 <kosmikus> ?
06:06:22 <Heffalump> http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~toplas/style/
06:06:33 <kosmikus> will have a look ...
06:06:41 <Heffalump> only if you've got nothing better to do :-)
06:07:00 <Heffalump> I was just vaguely hoping someone might be able to say "oh, yes, that happened to me, this is how you fix it"
06:07:59 <shapr> I have a unicycling question, but I suspect this isn't the best forum :-)
06:09:06 <kosmikus> Heffalump: at least I get the same error ...
06:09:42 * Marvin-- knows very little of the inner majjicks of LaTeX
06:09:43 <Heffalump> shapr: :-) (do you think my question is offtopic?)
06:09:53 * Heffalump went into them quite a lot when writing my thesis
06:10:00 <Heffalump> but I don't really enjoy doing so :-)
06:10:06 <Marvin--> of course it's off topic... do we care? No :-)
06:10:14 <Heffalump> s/offtopic/too &/ :-)
06:11:13 <shapr> actually, I think academic papers are on-topic here
06:11:22 <shapr> maybe not on #php though ;-)
06:11:45 <shapr> Marvin--: hey, do you get huge amounts of snow there in the winter? how do you bicycle over it? are there special snow tires?
06:11:56 <shapr> I'm trying to figure out how I could unicycle over deep snow.
06:12:04 <shapr> or any sort of ice/snow/etc
06:13:01 <Marvin--> shapr: we don't really get a lot of snow in Göteborg, this year was kind of an exception, actually, and they plow both roads and bike roads, so it's not a problem
06:13:01 <Heffalump> kosmikus: btw, I've hacked around it for now with:
06:13:06 <Marvin--> I know there are snow tires, but I don't use them
06:13:09 <Heffalump> \newcommand\realpageref{}
06:13:16 <Marvin--> never felt the need, you just have to be extra careful
06:13:28 <earthy> heffalump: that almost sounds like a good trick (even if nasty)
06:13:38 <shapr> extracareful and unicycle don't really fit into the same sentence :-)
06:14:19 <kosmikus> Heffalump: I'd suggest \let\realpageref\pageref instead.
06:14:30 <kosmikus> seems to have to do with changes in the hyperref package ...
06:16:26 <Heffalump> oh, ta :-)
06:17:05 <Heffalump> causes warnings about undefined references though
06:17:19 <Heffalump> seems it can't work out the final page number
06:18:22 <kosmikus> hmm, I don't get these ...
06:18:47 <Heffalump> oh, didn't test it with their file
06:19:31 <Heffalump> did you have to comment out \usepackage[pdfmark]{hyperref} too, btw?
06:25:59 * earthy coughs
06:26:02 <kosmikus> no, I had to comment out the first occurrence of "\def\pdfbookmark#1#2{}%" in the class file, which is not nice
06:27:09 <Heffalump> ah :-)
06:27:49 <kosmikus> probably the best "solution" in this situation would be to find a hyperref.sty version from around the date of acmtrans2e.cls (which, with 1997, is really old) ...
06:28:29 <Heffalump> hmmm./
06:39:53 <SyntaxPolice> good morning #haskell
06:40:21 <reffie> hi
06:41:09 * Marvin-- grumbles about how the **** to make d-i work
06:42:01 <shapr> hi Arnia!
06:42:17 <shapr> g'morning SyntaxPolice 
06:42:30 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: we're registered and reserved, yay!
06:42:37 <Arnia> shapr: Finally got my blog running *grins wildly*
06:42:44 <shapr> Arnia: spiffy! where is it?
06:43:11 <Arnia> http://www.nosightatnight.co.uk
06:43:40 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: I'm dancing around!
06:43:49 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: you're going to ride a unicycle over snow? thats awesome.
06:44:48 <shapr> I hope so
06:44:51 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: "insane" would be my description of it
06:45:01 <shapr> unicycling is fun!
06:45:05 <SyntaxPolice> Arnia: what software is that?
06:45:36 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: insanity is relative :)
06:46:07 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: I could never get the form on apt-get.org to submit without an error
06:46:37 <Igloo> Oh  :-(
06:47:22 <shapr> Igloo: you asked whether skilled unicycling is also good exercise, the posts on rec.sport.unicycling imply that by default it's low or mid level exercise, but that Mountain Unicycling is better than bicycling.
06:47:32 <Igloo> You could e-mail webmaster@apt-get.org
06:47:46 <shapr> so now I want two more unicycles, a coker and a MUni
06:48:15 <Arnia> SyntaxPolice: MovableType
06:48:38 <Igloo> shapr: What level is bicycling?
06:48:43 <Igloo> And walking?
06:50:10 <shapr> with bicycling you can choose how much effort you require for any given part, since you have gears
06:50:27 <shapr> unicycles are fixed
06:50:34 <SyntaxPolice> Arnia: looks good
06:50:40 <shapr> though I have thought of a planetary gearing system that might work
06:50:51 <shapr> hi seafood 
06:51:07 <Igloo> planetary gearing system?
06:51:09 <seafood> shapr: hello
06:51:20 <seafood> Igloo: Hello 
06:51:24 <learning_haskell> test :: Parser something_here
06:51:27 <Igloo> You could make gears by having two chains and a cog above the wheel/pedals
06:51:29 * Heffalump suggests two unicycles and a crossbar
06:51:34 <Igloo> Hi seafood
06:51:38 <learning_haskell> what should I replace something_here with ?
06:51:42 <shapr> Igloo: yah, giraffes work like that
06:52:32 <shapr> a planetary gear has an outer toothed ring, a much smaller inner gear, and three gears 'suspending' the two
06:52:33 <Igloo> learning_haskell: Depends what test does. something_here is actually perfectly valid for some definitions, but probably not any useful ones
06:53:00 <learning_haskell> something_here can be replaced by what ?
06:53:04 * Igloo googles in the hope of pictures  :-)
06:53:19 <learning_haskell> anythin ?
06:53:29 <shapr> Igloo: /usr/lib/xscreensaver/gears -planetary
06:53:35 <Arnia> All my owm design
06:53:44 <shapr> apt-get install xscreensaver-gl
06:54:05 <seafood> Any Mac OS X GHC users here?
06:54:14 <Igloo> Ah, I'll wait until I go to comlab
06:54:26 <learning_haskell> Igloo could you give some example with parse ?
06:54:40 * Igloo finds a picture
06:54:41 <shapr> Igloo: http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~ch865/english/planetary.html
06:55:16 <Igloo> lh: What are you trying to do?
06:57:00 <shapr> Igloo: so, my idea for a unicycle gearing system is to allow any of three rings to lock to wheel, pedals, or frame
06:58:38 <Igloo> So you'd probably want a fixed outer ring and for different ratios of inner gears to slide left and right into position? Sounds tricky
06:59:11 <Igloo> And you'd need to get the gears lines up for them to go in
07:01:20 <shapr> if you use the gears shown, driving the ring gear would give a lower ratio on the planet carriers
07:01:37 <shapr> or you could switch that to get higher speed and lower torque
07:02:20 <Igloo> I'm not following
07:02:50 <shapr> assume the pedals can be switched to drive any of the three, ring, carriers, or sun 
07:03:00 <Igloo> Oh, right. Eeep.
07:03:24 <shapr> so you have three rings, and three pieces
07:03:36 <Igloo> That just sounds scary
07:03:44 <shapr> ring gear, planet carriers, sun gear; and pedals, wheel, and frame
07:03:46 <shapr> why is that scary?
07:03:53 * Igloo thinks shapr should model it in HOpenGL  :-)
07:03:58 <SyntaxPolice> learning_haskell: what are you asking about?
07:03:58 <shapr> heh, good idea!
07:04:06 <Igloo> Well, the mechanisms for switching gear frighten me
07:07:17 <learning_haskell> SyntaxPolice I'd like to how parse declarations works
07:10:36 <Igloo> Which parser library are you using?
07:12:54 <learning_haskell> import ParseLib
07:13:08 <learning_haskell> How do I see the version ?
07:15:24 <Igloo> Where did you get it?
07:16:20 <SyntaxPolice> learning_haskell: version information is not necessarily available. are you using hugs? ghc? nhc?
07:16:30 <learning_haskell> hugs
07:16:49 <SyntaxPolice> try :t parse
07:16:58 <SyntaxPolice> that'll tell us what type the parse function is
07:17:15 <SyntaxPolice> I've never heard of ParseLib, I'm not sure its standard. like Igloo said, where did you get it?
07:18:00 <Igloo> Ah, looks like it comes with hugs
07:18:13 <Igloo> But I have no idea what being in oldlib/ means
07:18:42 <Marvin--> probably "don't use this, really"
07:19:28 <Igloo> ParseLib> papply (many letter) "hello world"
07:19:29 <Igloo> [("hello"," world")]
07:19:40 <Igloo> is how to use it, anyway. See the source for other functions it provides.
07:20:30 <opet> iirc it's monadic combinator parser code from a graham hutton and erik meijer paper
07:33:58 * Marvin-- does really elaborate things to play with libicu :-/
07:34:41 <learning_haskell> er... I see your point.. But I don't really know what to add to the Parser to fix the error
07:35:06 <Marvin--> I think you need to learn a bit about the type system
07:35:31 <learning_haskell> x :: char
07:35:33 <learning_haskell> that stuff ?
07:35:39 <shapr> yes, that stuff.
07:36:10 <learning_haskell> I thougth haskell was easy to learn o_O
07:36:19 <shapr> it is
07:36:41 <vegai> compared to what?
07:36:48 <Marvin--> learning_haskell: x :: Char
07:36:50 <vegai> quantum physics? =)
07:37:31 <reffie> heh.
07:37:57 <SyntaxPolice> someone or other did a study saying that people who learn to program imperitively have trouble learning functionally, but that the reverse is also true. I always thought that was interesting.
07:38:23 <shapr> it's the whole functional idea that fascinates me.
07:38:27 <Heffalump> in a sense functional programming is more natural if you don't think about ordering a sequence of commands
07:38:34 <shapr> right
07:38:34 <Heffalump> well, it's more natural for calculating things
07:38:41 <vegai> how come? you thought earlier that FP is somehow above imperative in this case?
07:38:45 <Heffalump> but it's not really more natural for saying "print this, then this"
07:38:48 <shapr> procedural is about being a micromanager
07:38:52 <learning_haskell> Marvin-- C uppercase ?
07:38:52 <shapr> functional is the other side of that
07:39:43 <shapr> imho, the best way to describe the difference is map versus for loops
07:39:44 <vegai> quick poll, please: What was your first language?
07:39:57 <shapr> my first was BASIC on a Sinclair something
07:40:01 <vegai> (c64 basic here) 
07:40:19 <learning_haskell> Visual Basic 6 :)
07:40:27 <Igloo> BASIC on an Amstrad CPC 464
07:40:27 <steveh> trash 80
07:40:39 <shapr> Igloo: what is one?
07:41:08 <vegai> ah, then I don't have to fear that Dijkstra was correct? =)
07:41:09 <Igloo> c64ish I think
07:41:13 <steveh> hypertalk came a little later
07:41:16 <shapr> what did Dijkstra say?
07:41:24 <vegai> about Basic rotting one's brains
07:41:26 <shapr> oh, that BASIC ruined people
07:41:33 <learning_haskell> why ?
07:41:41 <shapr> because it's a crap language ;-)
07:41:50 <vegai> "...as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration."
07:41:51 <steveh> well
07:41:56 <shapr> people end up trying to write high literature in pidgin
07:42:01 <Marvin--> vegai: Pascal
07:42:09 <steveh> I think it more applies to people who became conditioned to solving larger problems with spaghetti code
07:42:16 <shapr> steveh: yes, I agree
07:42:22 <Marvin--> vegai: or more precisely, Turbo Pascal (5? perhaps? Don't remember the versioning :)
07:42:28 <vegai> I guess many started with imperative
07:42:33 <steveh> small programs on bitty boxes by 10-year-olds probably doesn't have much ill effect
07:42:34 <Igloo> http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=84
07:42:34 <steveh> :)
07:42:44 <vegai> steveh: yeah, perhaps
07:43:01 <shapr> in any case, with procedural languages you say for (i=0;i<array.length;i++) { print array[i] }
07:43:16 <shapr> in functional languages you say map print array
07:43:39 <Igloo> Oh, "Locomotive Basic" apparently
07:43:49 <SyntaxPolice> vegai: first language: pascal, the C++
07:43:52 <SyntaxPolice> s/the/then
07:43:57 <Marvin--> shapr: interesting that you choose printing as an example, as it's inherently imperative, even in haskell
07:44:08 <steveh> shapr: nah, be nice to procedural languages, most have a "for each" now
07:44:31 <vegai> some even have "map" =)
07:44:45 <steveh> even C++ has for_each
07:44:46 <steveh> :-P
07:44:46 <learning_haskell> anyone has 1st language ASM ?
07:44:58 <vegai> that would be interesting
07:45:32 <steveh> ASM is like basic with absolutely no conveniences :)
07:45:51 <learning_haskell> Sure it is useful
07:45:55 <learning_haskell> very useful
07:46:04 <learning_haskell> for me it will be :)
07:46:17 <learning_haskell> robotics have to use it all the time
07:46:23 <Marvin--> I can see how ASM could be useful, but not *basic
07:46:49 <Marvin--> isn't robotics more a case of a domain-specific language rather than an assembly language, though?=
07:46:53 <Marvin--> s/=//
07:47:09 <steveh> Marvin--: I'd say so
07:47:18 <learning_haskell> I don't other language that can replace ASM
07:47:34 <shapr> C
07:47:35 <shapr> :-P
07:47:44 <shapr> everyone's favorite portable assembly
07:48:07 <shapr> aha, I started with the timex sinclair 1000
07:48:11 <steveh> the only reasons to program substantially in assembler is to optimize resource usage, or there is no cross-compiler  for the architecture you're targeting
07:48:12 <steveh> AFAICT
07:48:21 <vegai> or when doing kernely stuff
07:48:39 <vegai> but not substantially even then, I guess
07:49:58 <vegai> does ghc output asm by itself?
07:50:02 <shapr> it can
07:50:05 <shapr> or it can output C
07:50:15 <vegai> ah, then there you go 
07:50:58 <vegai> a sort of higher level portable assembler-sorta language might be nice
07:51:09 <shapr> the primary GHC guy is working on that
07:51:11 <vegai> without the icky things, as much as possible
07:51:11 <shapr> calls it C--
07:51:17 <vegai> ah, I've heard of that
07:51:17 <learning_haskell> Humm how can you run a exe program and grab its output ?
07:51:31 <learning_haskell> exe program made in C
07:51:52 <vegai> unfortunate name for googling ;-/
07:52:05 <shapr> vegai: look for Simon Peyton-Jones
07:52:11 <shapr> and his publications page
07:52:25 <vegai> ah, Him
07:52:29 <Igloo> www.cminusminus.org
07:53:20 <vegai> yup
07:53:48 <learning_haskell> ok
07:53:56 <shapr> so, in summary, Haskell is easy to learn :-P
07:54:51 <vegai> + it doesn't cause (much) permanent damage to you =)
07:55:08 <shapr> except that you try to get people to play with your monads
07:55:14 <shapr> and that often upsets them.
07:55:17 <vegai> that will hurt
07:55:23 <shapr> yup
07:55:44 <vegai> not that I know, but...
07:56:09 <learning_haskell> monads.. what the hell is that
07:56:15 <shapr> @fact monads
07:56:15 <lambdabot> http://www.abercrombiegroup.co.uk/~noel/research/monads.html http://www.cs.fit.edu/~satkin/monads.html
07:58:46 <learning_haskell> @fact learning_haskell
07:58:47 <lambdabot> Nothing
07:58:51 <learning_haskell> :)
07:59:46 <Marvin--> learning_haskell: funny you should phrase it like that, there's a page called "What the Hell are Monads?" I think
08:00:01 <learning_haskell> hehe
08:01:43 <shapr> hoi dark
08:01:44 <shapr> hoe gaat?
08:01:48 <dark> Hallo :)
08:02:01 <dark> Net terug uit Oslo.
08:02:07 <Marvin--> hello dark
08:02:50 <dark> Marvin: I'm sorry that we didn't get to do more than say hi.
08:03:35 <Marvin--> yeah :/ that's sort of the way it is with intensive conferences
08:03:41 <Marvin--> and I was largely in d-i mode too
08:03:59 <dark> Yeah.  I was pulled away by Karen Yee just when we met :)  And I'd promised her an interview at lunchtime.
08:04:27 <dark> I head the d-i people were in a separate room but I never found it :-)
08:04:37 * SyntaxPolice is getting addicted to flamewars on LKML and debian-devel
08:05:02 <Marvin--> dark: heh, it was on the third floor
08:05:03 * Igloo would love to see NM get fixed
08:05:03 <dark> SyntaxPolice: Reading alt.atheism for a while tends to cure that :)
08:05:20 * SyntaxPolice is thinking of putting his gpg keysig on his business card for the ICFP
08:05:20 <Igloo> It's getting harder and harder to stay out of it
08:05:35 <Marvin--> and it wasn't really the d-i room, it was just that all the d-i people were there, and some others who didn't get any space elsewhere
08:05:39 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: your fingerprint, you mean
08:05:42 <shapr> dark: you have a published online interview?
08:05:57 <SyntaxPolice> dark: I bet! the funniest flamewar I ever saw was in a music practice room where it started discussing religion, moved to poetry, then on to whether or not writing on the practice room walls is good
08:06:00 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: yeah
08:06:12 * Marvin-- would have to use a vewwy vewwy small font to get his key on a business card... a business card CD-ROM would work though
08:07:10 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: yeah, I'm wondering what effect this will have on my application.  It'll be along time before I can complain, though because it took me a while to finish tasks & skills
08:07:19 <SyntaxPolice> btw, anyone who thinks it can be done in a handful of hours didn't have my AM.
08:07:40 <Igloo> :-)
08:07:43 <Igloo> Who was it?
08:07:44 <Marvin--> of course it can't be done in a handful of hours, depending on the AM it will take a various number of days
08:07:50 * Marvin-- met his AM at debconf :-)
08:08:08 <Marvin--> didn't have time to say more than "hi" to him either, though
08:09:33 <Igloo> Hmm, not much info on nm.d.o
08:09:43 <Marvin--> it usually lists the AM though
08:09:43 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: algernon is my AM
08:09:52 <SyntaxPolice> http://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=ijones%40syntaxpolice.org
08:10:01 <Igloo> It does claim you haven't done T&S yet though
08:10:15 <SyntaxPolice> I sent it in, I think that just means he hasn't graded it yet
08:10:26 <Marvin--> it means he hasn't graded it yet
08:11:25 * Marvin-- tries to remember who algernon is, which isn't easy since samosa is dead...
08:11:46 <Igloo> Why was your ID checked almost a year before you applied?
08:12:16 <Marvin--> Igloo: er, that could be related to the fire that burnt down the machine nm was hosted on, remember?
08:12:30 <Igloo> Ah, OK
08:12:50 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: algernon is Gergely Nagy
08:13:02 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: hmm, don't know who that is
08:13:14 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: also it may be that the date my id was checked ist he date that walters signed my key, not sure.
08:13:21 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: yeah, I haven't seen him around
08:13:45 <SyntaxPolice> he maintains a bunch of packages I"ve never heard of and don't have installed :)
08:14:21 <learning_haskell> Haskell is being developed by a british univ, right ?
08:14:39 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: he's probably one of them weird people who just quietly go about doing their job :)
08:15:26 <shapr> learning_haskell: I'd say it's developed by its users
08:15:43 <Heffalump> it's been developed by a lot of people
08:15:45 <Riastradh> Haskell is being developed by a lot of people.
08:15:46 <Riastradh> Heh.
08:15:47 <Heffalump> mostly in Europe and the USA.
08:16:05 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: indeed!
08:16:06 <shapr> Igloo: ok, what's scary about the gear changing part of such a system?
08:16:10 <Heffalump> Glasgow University in the UK used to be a big part of it, but that's not been true for a while.
08:16:23 <Riastradh> There's a lot of Haskell stuff in Sweden, too.
08:17:07 <shapr> hej phubuh 
08:17:11 <shapr> hur är det med dig?
08:17:14 <Igloo> shapr: It would have to be quite complex wouldn't it?
08:17:15 <Heffalump> yeah, and Utrecht
08:17:17 <Heffalump> and OGI.
08:17:53 <Igloo> I mean, to change from driving the inner wheel to one of the small ones something is going to have to move, but the seat, pedals and wheel are essentially relatively fixed
08:18:18 <phubuh> hej shapr! det Ã¤r bra. jag lÃ¤ser specifikationen fÃ¶r javas virtual machine :-)
08:18:49 * Marvin-- swears at irc not playing well with character sets
08:19:01 <Marvin--> bloody obsolete bleedin' protocol
08:19:22 <Heffalump> the new IRC RFCs are incredibly complicated
08:19:31 <Marvin--> I'm not surprised
08:19:39 <Marvin--> communication is incredibly complicated
08:19:42 <Riastradh> Use a better protocol, then, and convince others to use it.
08:20:13 <Riastradh> We'll all probably be happy to get away from lilo!
08:20:31 <Marvin--> :)
08:20:35 <phubuh> heh
08:20:53 <shapr> Igloo: the simplest solution would be lateral sliding
08:21:00 <Marvin--> Riastradh: ohno, now lilo's deathsquad will find you and kill you for badmouthing him!
08:21:04 <shapr> radial tangential locks would be more complex I think
08:21:29 <shapr> hi Darius
08:21:30 <Marvin--> lateral wossname?
08:21:34 <Riastradh> Yeah, like what happened to all those hundreds of people whom I've seen badmouthing all across the network!
08:21:43 <ddarius> heya
08:21:55 <shapr> Marvin--: I'm talking about a unicycle gearing idea I had
08:22:06 <shapr> Igloo is helping by pointing out the bugs in the system :-)
08:22:07 * Marvin-- wonders about what kind of _bi_cycle to buy
08:22:13 <Marvin--> shapr: I got that much
08:22:24 <shapr> have you seen planetary gears?
08:22:41 <shapr> phubuh: java är inte min favorit
08:23:02 <phubuh> inte min heller
08:23:04 <shapr> Igloo: you're right, I should make a HOpenGL animation
08:23:23 <shapr> ddarius: the 36 chapter monstrosity is very spiffy, I'm learning all kinds of stuff
08:23:50 <Igloo> Yeah, we can work up to the physics model from there  :-)
08:23:56 <shapr> heh
08:23:58 <Marvin--> isn't it kind of pointless to say "good afternoon" when there are people from many many time zones on the network?
08:24:09 <shapr> "greetings" might be better
08:24:52 <Marvin--> when lilo posts a global notice, all I see is "blah blah blah blah send me money blah blah blah"
08:24:55 <Igloo> Oh, shapr, you'll be proud of me - I've been finding bugs with QC  :-)
08:24:56 <shapr> Igloo: the biggest problem I have, where to put a gearshift on a unicycle??
08:25:04 * shapr cheers happily
08:25:05 <Igloo> Under the front of the seat
08:25:05 <shapr> yay!
08:25:17 <shapr> but how do you shape it for shifting?
08:25:30 <shapr> you have to hold onto the front of the seat for jumping and other tricks
08:25:43 <Igloo> You push it up into the seat and move it in the natural axis
08:25:56 <Igloo> Which I think is forwards/backwards
08:25:58 <shapr> what's the natural axis?
08:26:01 <shapr> oh, I see
08:26:14 <shapr> ok, I can make that work
08:26:19 <Igloo> It's whatever feels natural  :-)
08:26:23 <shapr> heh
08:26:25 <shapr> good point
08:28:32 * Marvin-- wonders what kind of scary functions libicu has for splitting up strings into words
08:31:34 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: Marvin--: I was thinking that a great way to motivate the DAM would be to give people who've passed T&S voting rights until they get accepted or rejected :)
08:31:46 <SyntaxPolice> (not to change the topic to off topic debian crap once again)
08:32:06 <Heffalump> T&S?
08:32:15 <shapr> I'm afraid to ask
08:32:22 <SyntaxPolice> tasks & skills, its one of the tests you have to pass to get through the debian new maintainer process
08:32:22 <Marvin--> why voting rights?
08:32:44 <Igloo> I think it would be fun for all the old people to have to go through NM under different names
08:32:45 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: because people who have put that much work into Debian should be able to participate in a meaningful way, and I think voting makes sense.
08:32:57 <Marvin--> what an incredibly dumb idea, P&P would make more sense
08:33:20 <Marvin--> putting work into Debian *is* participating in a meaningful way
08:33:31 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: that way if the process is broken, NMs can influence the process
08:33:49 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: my idea is incredibly dumb!? :( 
08:34:16 <shapr> isn't making debs the most useful part of being a debian developer?
08:34:19 <steveh> freebsd 0wnz0rz j00 anyway </troll>
08:34:22 <SyntaxPolice> which is why I didn't post it to debian-devel of course :)
08:34:29 <Marvin--> shapr: yes and no
08:34:31 <shapr> or am I thinking from the user-centric viewpoint?
08:34:37 <shapr> what else is there to debian?
08:34:41 <Marvin--> there's a lot of infrastructure to be managed
08:34:42 <shapr> installer?
08:35:10 <Marvin--> web sites, translations, installer, archive maintainence, mirroring, releasing, security...
08:35:20 <shapr> right, hadn't thought of that
08:36:14 <Marvin--> are there any countries that gives you the right to vote before getting citizenship in said country?
08:36:30 <Heffalump> the UK does
08:36:39 <Heffalump> certain people have the right to vote without being citizens
08:36:51 <Heffalump> though it's complicated and depends on the type of election
08:37:07 <Heffalump> mainly related to the Commonwealth, anyway
08:37:21 <shapr> sweden does that
08:37:28 <shapr> so does finland
08:37:52 <shapr> the idea being that if you live in an area, you are part of that area after some time, even if you're not a citizen
08:37:56 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: if someone doesn't deserve to vote, then reject them so they can't influence the process
08:38:22 <shapr> speaking of which, is there somewhere I can go to vote a debian developer into complete nitwit status?
08:38:53 <shapr> the zope debs suck very much
08:39:05 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: the point is that figuring out if someone should be accepted or rejected is a time consuming process, the main problem is that elmo is the only guy who wants to do it, and he does a lot of *other* stuff that nobody else wants to do too
08:39:16 <shapr> and the maintainer has ego problems imho
08:39:44 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: thats hard to see from my position and from the thread, it sounds more like he's avoiding rejecting people because he doesn't want to bother.
08:39:47 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: and seeing as there are very very few votes every year, I don't see the point
08:40:10 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: I don't know what elmo's workflow is, and neither do you
08:41:12 <SyntaxPolice> I'm not trying to punish him.
08:41:17 <Igloo> shapr: debian-devel is the normal place  :-)
08:41:32 <shapr> ok, thanks
08:41:50 <Igloo> Err, if you really want YA flame war
08:41:59 <shapr> YA?
08:42:01 <shapr> oh
08:42:04 <Heffalump> it would be better to politely challenge decisions, rather than insult him.
08:42:22 <Marvin--> shapr: in Sweden, only for local and regional votes, not for the parliament vote, iirc
08:42:48 <Igloo> Who do you mean, anyway? There are lots of zope packages with different maintainers
08:42:49 <Marvin--> Heffalump: that's not the Debian Way!!! We must have flame wars!
08:43:02 <shapr> Igloo: zope itself, Luca De'Whiskey's
08:43:08 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: so I don't know; is there a history of trying to find trustworthy people to fulfill the DAM position?
08:43:13 <Igloo> Ah, just spotted that  :-)
08:43:30 <SyntaxPolice> It bothers me when people shout "No one else wants to do it!" the first time the posibility of someone else doing it comes up.
08:44:05 <shapr> Igloo: if debian users on the #zope channel all recommend installing the source package, you know something's wrong :-)
08:44:14 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: yes, the recommended way when you want to become DAM is to become an AM, if you really can handle that (most people can't), Then We'll See
08:44:18 <Igloo> My word he maintains a lot of php crap
08:44:42 <shapr> gutentag kosmikus
08:44:47 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: if you do good AM work, trust should not be an issue
08:44:53 <Igloo> It's been orphaned according to http://packages.qa.debian.org/z/zope.html
08:45:05 <shapr> huh, when did that happen?
08:45:13 <Marvin--> shapr: quick, adopt it!
08:45:22 <Igloo> Oh, I think Luca is the person who is adopting it
08:45:31 <Marvin--> ah, yes
08:45:37 <shapr> Marvin--: good idea
08:45:42 <shapr> oh
08:45:51 <Igloo> But the same page lists him as maintainer
08:45:58 <shapr> seriously, most of my profitable income is Zope, and it looks like even more will be zope
08:46:12 <shapr> so I have a strong interest in making the debs the best they can be
08:46:31 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: OK I haven't been around long enough to see it play out.  How long has the current DAM been in place?  No one has done good enough AM work? No one has been asked to become DAM? (I guess that kind of thing might be unknown from the outside.)
08:46:38 <Heffalump> submit improvements through the BTS, and if that gets nowhere bring it up on debian-devel
08:46:42 <shapr> the next Zope site on the horizon may have ten thousand users or so
08:47:25 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: I don't really know, since I haven't been "inside" for more than six months, but from what I've seen during my participation of Debian, every person who wanted to know how to become a DAM has been recommended to do AM work
08:48:04 <shapr> oh, I *must* get my key signed at ICFP, then I can apply for NM!
08:48:10 * shapr bounces cheerfully
08:48:11 <Marvin--> that bug page existing is incredibly broken though, you don't file an RFA when you know who's going to adopt it, the new maintainer just does an upload with a changed Maintainer: field
08:48:48 <Igloo> You can probably apply and get through P&P+T&S before getting signed
08:49:06 <Marvin--> more importantly, you should start doing *work* *before* *applying*
08:49:16 <shapr> ok
08:49:37 <shapr> I think it makes most sense to start with zope debs that I need for clients, that don't already exist
08:49:57 * shapr bounces enthusiastically
08:50:11 <Marvin--> (damn, I've gotten used to my laptop keyboard during the week in Oslo, and now I can't find <>|)
08:50:26 <Marvin--> shapr: you mean for add-ons?
08:50:27 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: but it is good to get your key signed at ICFP :)
08:50:34 <dark> I think the best way to speed up DAM work is to have Overfiend run for DPL more often.
08:50:56 <Marvin--> dark: more often than every year? :)
08:50:58 <shapr> Marvin--: yes, lots of zope products that I use that aren't debs
08:51:06 <shapr> I'd like to see z3 debs also
08:51:59 <Marvin--> shapr: zope3 would be regarded as a new upstream version of zope, you should coordinate that with the zope maintainer
08:52:21 <Marvin--> dark: I found it funny how many of the talks made fun of OF in the slides :-)
08:52:32 <dark> Marvin: He's an easy target :)
08:52:56 <SyntaxPolice> who's overfiend?
08:52:56 <Marvin--> shapr: but yes, packaging up free zope stuff, filing ITP:s for them and looking for sponsors is a good way to start
08:53:02 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: Branden Robinson
08:53:32 <dark> But I did notice how there was a sudden spurt of DAM activity during the election, which dropped off as soon as Overfiend wasn't elected :)
08:53:52 <Marvin--> heh
08:53:54 <shapr> Marvin--: ok, thanks
08:54:11 <Marvin--> dark: or perhaps, "as soon as someone got elected"?
08:54:37 <dark> No, I think the threat of Overfiend being elected was the motivator.
08:54:45 <Marvin--> in my opinion, the only thing that's broken with the NM process is that it's understaffed, which is understandable because it's probably not a whole lot of fun
08:54:49 <Marvin--> haha
08:55:55 <SyntaxPolice> Marvin--: From what I can see, I would agree.
08:56:30 <Marvin--> I get really annoyed by people in the debate who talk about "people not being able to contribute", yes they can! It's just a little more work, in finding sponsors, but many prospective developers (like myself) find that invaluable in double-checking the packages when you're new at it
08:56:35 <SyntaxPolice> maybe part of the NM could be trying to move people toward pitching in on infrastructure, rather than just packages
08:56:47 <Marvin--> yes, there was talk about that
08:57:21 <shapr> how do you pitch in on infrastructure?
08:57:33 <Marvin--> someone contributing to important projects rather than just packaging a shitty little piece of software are more likely to get their accounts fastaer
08:57:36 <shapr> what about bittorrent hosting?
08:58:18 <Marvin--> shapr: in d-i, we usually say "send patches to the BTS and the mailing list, when we get tired of applying the patches, we'll give you write access to the cvs"
08:58:43 <Marvin--> which is a very sane way of doing it, IMO
08:58:47 <shapr> heheh
08:58:51 <shapr> I like that plan
08:59:25 <Marvin--> well, I'm off
08:59:30 * SyntaxPolice wishes his apt patches would get applied :(
08:59:32 <SyntaxPolice> l8r Marvin--
08:59:37 <dark> I don't think it's good to use sponsorship as a substitute for peer review.  If we want peer review, we should set it up, and not just for new maintainers but for anyone who wants it.
09:00:19 <dark> I personally wouldn't even begin contributing to a group that won't let me in.  I have better things to do :)
09:00:21 <SyntaxPolice> dark: that would be nice. I feel like I would get flamed if I posted a package that was somewhat broken and asked for advice :)
09:00:22 <shapr> grr
09:00:27 <Marvin--> dark: of course, which is why co-maintainence is encouraged
09:00:46 <dark> SyntaxPolice: on debian-mentors you wouldn't get flamed.
09:00:47 <Igloo> If I'd expected becoming a DD to take a year or more I'm not sure I'd have bothered
09:00:55 <shapr> it takes a year?
09:01:03 <dark> shapr: It depends on unknown factors.
09:01:14 <shapr> sheez
09:01:24 <shapr> maybe I should start maintaining the NM process ;-)
09:01:34 <Igloo> ISTR people were complaining about some taking 6 months or so when I joined, but I think I got through really quickly
09:01:42 <Marvin--> I really don't get it, having an account is for me just a means of getting uploads done, there is also the voting, but that doesn't interest me so much, really...
09:01:43 <shapr> that would require me having a clue in the first place of course
09:02:39 <Marvin--> the only people who complained about that were my sponsors, I didn't :)
09:02:39 <dark> Marvin: Being part of the group is the important thing for me.  Being an outsider who's grudgingly allowed to devote time and energy is not a model that attracts me.
09:02:40 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: yeah, you should start the process ASAP
09:02:54 <shapr> ok
09:02:55 <Marvin--> SyntaxPolice: I'm not sure that gets you through faster
09:02:57 <Riastradh> Marvin--, yes, _please_ start up a new network with a new protocol for us to use!
09:03:06 <Marvin--> but I was leaving...right...
09:03:07 * SyntaxPolice agrees with dark. I'm far more motivated to work on haskell stuff because I feel accepted by the community
09:03:09 <Igloo> Marvin: I never had to go via a sponsor, but having to wait even just a few days for my uploads to make it would have annoyed me, as would being treated like a lesser citizen for a year regardless of how I was performing
09:03:10 <SyntaxPolice> hehe
09:03:13 <Marvin--> (have to go change back my NOK to SEK :)
09:03:22 <shapr> has anyone actually suggested a new and improved IRC protocol?
09:03:29 <shapr> I want IRCv6
09:03:29 * Igloo could be wrong about how much it would have annoyed me as I didn't experience it
09:03:34 * Marvin-- waves
09:03:39 <shapr> then packets are just multicast
09:03:44 <shapr> no central server needed
09:03:52 <Riastradh> Design a new protocol, then!
09:03:53 <dark> Another thing I find important is that I don't want to take responsibility for a package if I can't fix it myself.
09:03:56 <shapr> each channel gets its own multicast address, and you subscribe
09:04:15 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: I think there are a handful of protocols out there,b ut thats just an impression
09:04:17 <shapr> does GHC have IPv6 support?
09:04:23 <dark> shapr: Lots of people have, but they never went anywhere :)  Even lilo has a sketch somewhere, I think.
09:04:48 * SyntaxPolice should get back to work
09:04:49 <SyntaxPolice> l8r all
09:04:51 <shapr> yes, go work
09:04:54 <shapr> me too
09:04:55 <shapr> I should work
09:04:59 <Riastradh> There's something like IRC+, but that's just turning IRC into email, really.
09:05:25 <Riastradh> s/like/called/1
09:05:38 <dark> Currently the most likely replacement for IRC seems to be ICQ and AIM hybrids.  This has to be stopped :-)
09:05:47 <shapr> truly
09:06:01 <shapr> hm
09:06:11 * Riastradh would do stuff with Twisted Words, but it (or rather, Jelly) is rather Python-specific.
09:06:25 <pesco> oh yes, hm, once we achieve world domination, that should no longer pose a problem though.
09:06:32 <dark> asuffield might have some plans, too, at least for the server-to-server protocol.
09:06:36 <shapr> I like the idea of a separate multicast address for each channel
09:06:49 <shapr> with multicast IPv6 you don't need a server
09:07:06 * Riastradh doesn't understand anything about 'multicast' and stuff.
09:07:08 <Heffalump> is delivery reliable?
09:07:11 <shapr> sure
09:07:20 <dark> shapr: Surely you still need a central point to allocate those addresses?
09:07:29 <Riastradh> What is it?
09:07:47 <dark> shapr: This might be the killer app for IPv6 :-)
09:07:55 <shapr> I think multicast addresses depend on the subnet
09:08:00 <dark> Especially if it gets used on phones.
09:08:03 <shapr> but other than that
09:08:17 * shapr looks for the IPv6 specs
09:08:25 <dark> Lots of wireless networks are already IPv6.
09:08:33 <shapr> it's a much more sane protocol
09:08:40 <dark> Hmm, channel keys with IPsec.
09:08:49 <Heffalump> shapr: errm, but IP isn't reliable
09:08:50 <pesco> Riastradh: A multicast address belongs to a group of nodes. So any packet sent to that address is routed to every node in the group.
09:09:36 <Riastradh> How does it get routed? -- is there a server at that address that routes it, does the client route it, is there a global list of nodes to multicast addresses, or something else?
09:10:27 <pesco> Riastradh: I'm not sure, but I suspect it must be similar to unicast routing.
09:10:36 <Heffalump> presumably multicast routing can be done in the same way as unicast routing, just by allowing routers to send packets to two different places
09:10:37 <Riastradh> ...which is?
09:11:05 <Heffalump> routers have a list of IP blocks and next hops, essentially.
09:11:37 <pesco> How does the process of joining a multicast group work?
09:11:44 <Heffalump> so 163.1.0.0/16 (Oxford uni) might be routed by the main UK academic router to the local "Thames Valley" router (massive simplification)
09:11:49 <Heffalump> oh, no idea :-)
09:14:00 <shapr> I would assume the border routers would keep a list of the multicast addresses subscribed inside their organization
09:14:44 <shapr> they'd only need to know which of their routers/hosts subscribe to a given multicast address
09:15:00 <shapr> so they could send it to them, and they'd know what do with it next.
09:16:18 <Heffalump> joins would have to propagate all the way through the net to routers that were already joined, though
09:16:20 <shapr> so if I wanted to subscribe to the freenode#haskell multicast, I'd ask my local gateway to subscribe, and he'd ask his gateway to subscribe, until you get up to the BGP level
09:16:30 <shapr> right, but as soon as you find an already joined router, you're done
09:16:51 <shapr> that already joined router just adds the asking router as a subscriber
09:17:33 <shapr> it sounds easy enough :-)
09:17:52 <pesco> Can there be multiple sending endpoints for a multicast group?
09:18:15 <shapr> I think so
09:19:32 <pesco> I want multicast chat. Even if messages drop now and then.
09:19:46 <shapr> http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-savola-v6ops-multicast-issues-01.txt
09:20:01 <shapr> section 2.1 there
09:20:24 <shapr> this author wants to switch from "any source multicast" to "single source multicast"
09:20:25 <pesco> Eek, I know how it ends when people send me URLs to read...
09:20:35 <shapr> huh?
09:20:40 <pesco> I start reading.
09:21:12 <pesco> There is an irresistable urge to click the URL before it scrolls off-screen.
09:21:19 <pesco> But this document is short, ok.
09:21:47 * pesco throws a quick frightened glance towards a pile of OMG specifications
09:29:32 <shapr> assuming that single source multicast works, you could do it with servers
09:31:18 <reffie> ipv4 multicast?
09:31:30 <reffie> i still have to see it work on the intarweb.
09:31:34 <shapr> from what I've heard ipv4 multicast doesn't work at all
09:31:37 <reffie> yeah
09:31:43 <reffie> it doesn't work.
09:31:57 <Riastradh> ...but we're talking about IPv6.
09:31:59 <reffie> i've not had the chance to try it on ipv6
09:32:03 <reffie> but it's supposed to be mandatory
09:32:03 <reffie> so..
09:32:29 <Riastradh> Something is wrong here...this PB&J sandwich tastes like bacon.
09:32:44 <shapr> Riastradh: that wasn't red currant jelly
09:32:56 <shapr> it was PICKLED PORK JOWLS!
09:33:01 * shapr ewws
09:33:07 <Riastradh> Oddly enough you were right in guessing that it was made from red currant jelly.
09:33:14 * Riastradh hrms.
09:33:17 <Igloo> Does Pseud maintain Edison?
09:33:24 <shapr> sort of
09:33:24 <Riastradh> Yes.
09:33:29 <shapr> in the form of HFL on sf.net
09:33:36 <Riastradh> What does HFL stand for?
09:33:53 <shapr> Haskell Foundation Libraries
09:33:54 <Igloo> Haskell Foundation Library
09:34:10 * Riastradh doesn't like the way Edison does its collection hierarchy.
09:34:20 <shapr> I thought it was a pun on Java Foundation Libraries, Netscape Foundation Libraries
09:34:22 <dark> Obviously shapr and Igloo must now duel to the death.
09:34:31 * shapr duals Igloo
09:34:38 <Igloo> The reason for asking is I'm thinking of mailing him to takl about a class hierarchy for collections
09:34:45 * Riastradh hands shapr a monad and Igloo a comonad.
09:34:53 <shapr> ok, we're dualed
09:35:04 * Igloo waves it around and makes voooob voooob noises
09:35:13 <Heffalump> igloo: careful with that, it's unsafe
09:35:16 * shapr waves his monad around making boov boov noises
09:35:27 <SyntaxPolice> I see Igloo's shwarts is as big as shapr's
09:35:29 <Riastradh> Heffalump, not if it's used in conjunction with a monad!
09:35:57 * Igloo sighs at http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=12576
09:36:05 <shapr> Monads, Procedural Prophylactics
09:36:07 <Igloo> When it said 10 messages I thought something might actually have been discussed there
09:36:12 <Heffalump> I believe the OI comonad is unsafe, and I shall continue to assert this until someone convinces me otherwise.
09:36:36 <shapr> Heffalump: if I bribe you with computer hardware, will you be convinced?
09:36:37 <shapr> ;-)
09:37:00 <Heffalump> no, but I might shut up :-)
09:37:05 * shapr snickers
09:38:33 <shapr> I've often wondered if it gets warm to have a vested interest.
09:38:42 <haskell> hey
09:38:45 <shapr> hi
09:38:51 <shapr> why you always changing nicknames?
09:39:20 <haskell> me ?
09:39:24 <SyntaxPolice> heh
09:39:27 <shapr> yah, you
09:39:37 <haskell> I don't know it is my script
09:39:46 * Igloo thinks about it so more and isn't convinced a single class for collections isn't best actually. Hmmm.
09:39:51 <haskell> I keeps changing after every 30 min or so
09:39:57 <haskell> I have to fix that
09:40:04 <shapr> I would appreciate it.
09:41:31 <dark> haskell: A nick like haskell is a bit confusing here :)
09:41:51 <haskell> hehe
09:42:01 <ask_hell> :D
09:44:53 <ask_hell> This is the first language I learn about functional language
09:45:01 <ask_hell> It really is quite strange for me
09:45:57 <shapr> functional programming is unlike procedural programming.
09:46:03 <shapr> in some ways :-)
09:46:08 <shapr> it's more like an equation
09:46:29 <dark> Unless you go crazy with the IO monad like I do :)
09:46:44 <ask_hell> monad... arg@#!
09:46:44 <dark> Then it illustrates the "Real Programmers can write FORTRAN in any language" principle.
09:46:51 * shapr grins
09:47:22 <Riastradh> Igloo, why is it best?
09:48:34 <Riastradh> Or did you confuse me with your n negatives?
09:48:42 <Igloo> Riastradh: Well, if you need really really fast insert/deleteMin but once every 10 years you need to be able to look at the maximum element then you probably want a datatype which you otherwise wouldn't define findMax for
09:48:47 <ddarius> dark: where's your FORTRAN LazyK code or Unlambda?
09:49:04 <dark> ddarius: Never heard of those :)
09:49:26 <shapr> unlambda is nifty
09:49:40 <Riastradh> Igloo, a findMax should be definable with a fold operation, though.
09:50:34 <Igloo> OK, so the Collection class default for findMax could define it in terms of fold
09:50:47 <Igloo> What are your arguments for splitting it up (or whatever else you wanted to do with it)?
09:52:15 <Igloo> (afk for 5 mins - will read anything said when I get back)
09:52:30 <Riastradh> I see no reason why bags should work in places where queues are necessary, but a Collection context would allow both.
09:54:11 <Riastradh> You might argue that you should put _everything_ into one big, huge typeclass, eliminating all subtypeclasses, so that you can mappend an integer and an array.
09:54:25 <Riastradh> -- because hey, you might need to ten years from now!
09:55:27 <Riastradh> If you want to add and remove and test for membership of arbitrary elements in a queue, then add an instance to the Bag typeclass for your queue type.
09:57:17 <Riastradh> (the first line was serious, the second two sarcastic, and the last one serious, for those of you whom I may have confused)
10:00:57 <shapr> time to play war3
10:00:58 <shapr> yay
10:01:20 <dark> Hmm.  queues record in what order elements were added, bags do not.  They might not be able to support the same interface.
10:01:30 <Marvin--> shapr: get network connectivity :-/
10:01:51 <shapr> ok ok
10:02:00 <shapr> I think I'll actually buy a copy so we can play online
10:02:00 <Riastradh> Well, queues would probably be a subtype of bags, actually.
10:02:04 * Igloo realises that there's no way to define get_next (in the queue sense) for a PQ, so it can't be entirely done
10:02:09 <Riastradh> Er, no, never mind.
10:02:12 * Marvin-- wants to be thrashed by shapr :)
10:02:14 <shapr> heh
10:02:25 <shapr> Marvin--: with my luck I can only beat the computer because I know it so well ;-)
10:02:42 <shapr> you'll do something unexpected and I'll panic :-)
10:02:47 <Marvin--> shapr: yes, you might be confused by my slow and stupid playing?
10:03:16 <shapr> the anticipaition will kill me :-)
10:03:25 <Igloo> Oh, dark already said that
10:06:16 <Marvin--> shapr: seriously, you'll rush me, and I'll be dead, and that's it
10:06:26 <Marvin--> I don't even know why I want to try it ;-)
10:06:43 <shapr> rushing isn't any fun
10:07:00 <shapr> it's more fun to play the maps where you have to dig or fly your way out of a bunch of trees
10:07:05 <Marvin--> well, rushing is complicated in WC3 compared to SC by the addition of heroes, of course
10:07:25 <shapr> because a good hero can totally stop a rush
10:07:25 <Marvin--> guh, I hate those maps, I hate fighting in cramped quarters
10:07:46 <shapr> for example, vampiric aura
10:07:54 <shapr> well, off to play
10:07:55 <shapr> bbl
10:16:19 * Marvin-- swears at the stupid newt python module
10:23:21 <ask_hell> Do you remember the Parse thing.. I am still looking for the solution.. lol
10:24:17 <Riastradh> Marvin--, serves you right for using Python!
10:25:21 <Marvin--> Riastradh: yeah, the incompetent programmers at RedHat apparently thought that only wrapping a subset of their C interface for Python was a Good Idea
10:25:36 <Marvin--> "but nobody would ever want to do it in another way..."<tm>
10:25:52 * Marvin-- sighs, don't tell me I have to prototype this in C instead... :-/
10:28:39 <ask_hell> hey earthy
10:38:16 * esap idles.
10:41:08 * Heffalump gets an email about haskell-libs
10:41:28 <Heffalump> are pseudonym and I the only admins of it? It only seems to have gone to us.
10:42:24 <Riastradh> Is there a way to import a binding b from a module M as c?
10:42:51 <Heffalump> not apart from the obvious long-winded way
10:42:56 <Riastradh> Which is?
10:43:06 <Heffalump> import M hiding b
10:43:13 <Heffalump> import qualified M
10:43:15 <Heffalump> c = M.b
10:43:25 <Riastradh> Oh well.
10:45:38 <keverets> I'm currently doing something like "tail (concat (map ((',':) . dToStr) ds)", but that's pretty nasty... is there a cleaner way of doing this?
10:46:19 <Riastradh> Is there not an intersperse function?
10:46:34 <keverets> there may be...
10:46:42 <keverets> @prelude intersperse
10:46:48 <lambdabot> *** "intersperse" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
10:46:48 <lambdabot> intersperse
10:46:48 <lambdabot>   intersperse ::  a -> [a] -> [a]
10:46:48 <lambdabot>   intersperse sep []       = []
10:46:49 <lambdabot>   intersperse sep [x]      = [x]
10:46:51 <lambdabot>   intersperse sep (x:xs)   = x : sep : intersperse sep xs
10:46:58 <keverets> neat.
10:47:16 <Riastradh> Er, wait, do you want it to return something like "foo,bar,baz" or "foo,bar,baz,"?
10:47:28 <keverets> Riastradh: the first one.
10:47:34 <Riastradh> OK, then use intersperse.
10:47:49 <Riastradh> intersperse ',' . dToStr $ ds
10:48:02 <Riastradh> Er, no.
10:48:24 <Riastradh> intersperse ',' (concatMap dToStr ds)
10:48:55 <Riastradh> @prelude concatMap
10:48:57 <lambdabot> *** "concatMap" prelude "Haskell Standard Prelude Dictionary": text follows
10:48:57 <lambdabot> concatMap
10:48:57 <lambdabot>   concatMap ::  (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
10:48:57 <lambdabot>   concatMap f       = concat . map f
10:49:53 <keverets> hrm... what do I need to import to get intersperse in ghc6 ?
10:50:00 <Riastradh> List
10:50:07 <keverets> ah, of course.
10:50:25 <Riastradh> Or, no...you wanted a list of (map dToStr ds) interspersed with commas, right?
10:50:38 <Riastradh> (er, not 'no' about List, that is)
10:51:04 <keverets> Riastradh: yeah...
10:51:27 <Riastradh> concat . intersperse ',' $ map dToStr ds
10:51:36 <Riastradh> Gack.
10:51:40 <Riastradh> concat . intersperse "," $ map dToStr ds
10:52:03 <Riastradh> (shows how much caffeine I've had today vs how much I need...)
10:52:14 <keverets> Riastradh: that's it.  Great!  Thanks!
11:03:44 <Riastradh> Is there a standard array folding function?
11:17:13 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: I've noticed that people announce rpms for ghc on the haskell@h.o list; you'd be welcome to announce your ghc debs there, including the haskell-experimental repository if you see fit :)
11:17:27 <SyntaxPolice> I can never quite decide what the difference between haskell@ and haskell-cafe@ is. I think I used to know.
11:20:04 <ddarius> I believe you can only post to haskell@ if you are a member and the topics they (are supposed to) handle differ.
11:21:37 <Marvin--> yeah it's members only, something I noticed when trying to send a mail to it from work :)
12:46:58 * SyntaxPolice bounces around
12:47:01 <SyntaxPolice> friendster is neet
12:47:18 <Marvin--> friendster?
12:47:43 <SyntaxPolice> you log in and network with your friends friends basically. it might have blogs, I'm not sure, but its a neat idea
12:47:53 <SyntaxPolice> it is also sorta an online dating thing.
12:48:06 <SyntaxPolice> but you're connected to people your friends know up to 7 levels or something
12:48:16 <Marvin--> oh, one of them "e-communities"
12:48:17 * SyntaxPolice isn't interested in online dating, btw
12:48:18 <keverets> shouldn't that be (theoretically) everybody?
12:48:21 <Igloo> Which RFC number?  :-)
12:48:22 <SyntaxPolice> yeah, an e-community
12:48:54 <SyntaxPolice> keverets: everybody who uses friendster? :) maybe when the community gets bigger, they'll lower the depth since the branching factor will be bigger
12:50:16 <elmex> e-* ... oh, uh... arg... evil phrases
12:50:26 <Riastradh> E-vil phrases!
12:50:34 <elmex> indeed
12:51:12 <elmex> e-lmex :)
12:52:15 <Igloo> You can't hide it just by changing nick - your aura betrays you
12:53:16 <Riastradh> E-! E-! E-! E-!
12:53:21 <Marvin--> /nick eMarvin
12:54:23 <keverets> iWhatever is as bad
12:54:27 <e-lmex> hehe
12:54:29 <e-lmex> iPod ?
12:54:37 <e-lmex> iGloo ? ;))
12:55:29 * Marvin-- always thinks "iRon" when he sees flashy irons
13:00:52 <e-lmex> it's 22:00 o clock here... and i'm having breakfast (got up around 10:00)
13:01:16 * Marvin-- regrets he didn't get an Espy t-shirt at debconf :/
13:01:24 <e-lmex> ;)
13:01:38 <Igloo> What's an Espy t-shirt?
13:01:46 <Marvin--> it says "Morons! I'm surrounded by morons!"
13:01:51 <e-lmex> lol
13:01:58 <e-lmex> really?
13:02:07 <Marvin--> http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2000/debian-devel-200002/msg01796.html
13:02:09 <Igloo> :-)
13:05:02 <e-lmex> evil :)
13:06:08 <Riastradh> Hmm.  Only one person so far has bought the HM t-shirt.
13:06:31 * Riastradh has made a whopping...
13:06:35 <Riastradh> ONE CENT of profit!
13:07:03 <Igloo> Donate it to a worthy FP cause  :-)
13:07:07 <Riastradh> I can now afford all of my childhood dreams!
13:07:24 <Igloo> I wonder if you can get one of those large cheques for $0.01
13:08:20 <Riastradh> CafePress people will be at booth 1337 at 'Comic Con San Diego'...I wonder if that booth number is coincidental.
13:08:41 <Riastradh> I THINK NOT!
13:08:49 <Igloo> :-)
13:08:49 <Marvin--> Igloo: heh
13:08:52 * Riastradh describes an elaborate conspiracy theory.
13:09:42 * Riastradh vaguely waves his hands about, while describing this theory, in odd gestures whose meanings have been forgotten over centuries.
13:10:51 * Riastradh forgot who ordered that sole t-shirt...it was someone in Pennsylvania, apparently.
13:11:07 <Riastradh> Oh, duh.
13:11:14 <Riastradh> That's the name of a person, not a city!
13:11:16 <Riastradh> Hey, wait a minute...
13:11:28 <Riastradh> Er, not Pennsylvania, that is.
13:11:56 <Riastradh> OH!  -Three- people have bought it!
13:12:05 * Riastradh had been listing the wrong totals sheet.
13:12:16 <Riastradh> My profit has trebled!
13:12:19 <Igloo> You said it was Kirsten Chevalier or whatever her name is I think
13:12:28 <Igloo> The first one, that is
13:12:46 <Riastradh> Yeah, that was the first person -- then it was Ashley Yakeley (the person who inspired the idea), and now George Washburn.
13:12:55 <Riastradh> Er, Geoffrey.
13:13:04 <Riastradh> I at first thought that last one was the name of a city and county.
13:13:52 <Igloo> You should mail them and see if they came out OK
13:17:29 <Riastradh> Who was going to buy them for HW if they came out good?  Marvin--?
13:18:45 <Riastradh> And Ashley Yakeley's email address is <ashley (a t) semantic (d o t) org>, right?  (death to spammers who go through logs!)
13:19:00 <Marvin--> I want one, but I'm not sure I'll be able to make it to HW
13:19:33 <Marvin--> er
13:19:53 <Igloo> It would still be better if someone could take it across to Sweden and post it from there
13:19:57 <Marvin--> after a key signing party, should I sign keys with "high" trust level, or "casual"?
13:20:00 <Igloo> Where is it again?
13:20:13 <Riastradh> Where is what?
13:20:16 <Marvin--> beware import limits though
13:20:21 <Igloo> The t-shirt site
13:20:32 <Riastradh> http://www.cafeshops.com/skicalc
13:21:17 <Igloo> I doubt they'll check, and if they aren't in plastic they probably won't even notice
13:21:29 * Marvin-- shrugs
13:21:33 <Marvin--> just trying to be legal and all
13:21:48 <Marvin--> I know that people have had problems with e.g. large thinkgeek shipping
13:21:55 <Riastradh> Legal?  What kind of a place is this?  You mean people actually follow the rules?!
13:22:13 <Marvin--> I try to
13:22:19 * Igloo doesn't know what the rules actually are - in particular, if there's a limit then each person is probably under it
13:22:45 <Igloo> I'm probably interested if you can get confirmatino that it came out OK
13:23:18 * Riastradh sends.
13:23:56 <Igloo> Looks like total cost will be around $15 if a few people want one
13:24:03 <Marvin--> aol
13:24:19 <Riastradh> Huh?  Each t-shit costs $14...
13:24:22 <Riastradh> T-shirt, even.
13:24:28 <Igloo> Shipping
13:24:45 <Riastradh> Yes, but how will the _total_ be $15?  _Each_ might end up being $15...
13:24:59 <Igloo> Total cost of each t-shirt
13:25:02 <Riastradh> Oh.
13:28:06 * Riastradh advertises the t-shirt in #ocaml and #sml.
13:28:15 <Riastradh> Are there any other channels in which it ought to be advertised?
13:29:45 <Igloo> Are you in the US, Riastradh?
13:30:03 <Igloo> #functional, but that seems to be just me  :-)
13:30:22 <Riastradh> Yes, I am, irritatingly enough.
13:30:45 <Igloo> Well, it's convenient from the PoV of finding someone to bring them to ICFP  :-)
13:31:02 <Igloo> Oh, assuming you're going?
13:31:18 <Riastradh> There is only a _slight_ chance that I shall go.
13:31:46 <Igloo> Ah  :-(
13:32:38 * Igloo tries to remember if hal is going
13:37:06 * Riastradh will almost certainly be going to the Scheme Workshop, as he's generally in the northeastern US.
13:41:11 <Marvin--> heh, "loving relationship" is about to become a standard Debian joke, I think, poor stockholm :)
14:45:22 <Heffalump> igloo: no, hal isn't
17:23:40 <clausen> Pseudonym!
17:23:55 <Pseudonym> G'day.
17:24:07 <Pseudonym> How's things?
17:24:12 <clausen> good :)
17:24:21 <clausen> I got a result!
17:24:24 <Pseudonym> Oh?
17:24:32 <clausen> members.optusnet.com.au/clausen/ideas/google/google-subvert.html
17:24:51 <clausen> (I don't think I told you about it...)
17:24:56 <Pseudonym> Oh, very cool.
17:25:21 * Pseudonym is going to forward this one around the office :-)
17:25:26 <clausen> thanks :)
17:25:34 * clausen learning the game of how to write good papers
17:27:05 * Igloo starts reading and wonders if you really mean lower bound
17:27:13 <Igloo> Oh, to be true, sorry, misread it
17:28:17 <clausen> please tell me if anything is hard to understand
17:28:26 * clausen is currently adding more explanations in the maths section
17:36:20 * Strike is away: I'm busy
18:34:15 * Pseudonym is bloody annoyed
18:34:33 <Pseudonym> http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch07s03.html#id2924091
18:34:42 <Pseudonym> People shouldn't write about things they don't understand.
18:36:41 * Igloo tries to write Debian GHC instructions in under 1000 words
18:36:55 <Pseudonym> Don't forget all the flags!
18:37:08 <Igloo> Maybe I should just have separate sections for stable and unstable
18:37:24 <Igloo> Oh, wait, the download page is versino specific, that makes things a lot easier
18:37:48 <Pseudonym> There you go.
18:39:01 <clausen> Pseudonym: esr doesn't discuss distributed ACID transactions
18:39:20 <Pseudonym> ESR basically seems to think "well I've never used it, so it must be useless".
18:39:21 * Heffalump appears
18:39:29 <Igloo> Hello
18:39:31 <Pseudonym> G'day.
18:39:36 <Pseudonym> Which is missing the point.
18:39:49 <clausen> he is probably correct... threads are often used where they shouldn't be
18:39:56 <Pseudonym> If your problem is highly separable, use multiple processes.  If it's basically sequential, use polling.
18:40:01 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: are you going to reply to that message about haskell-libs? I'm afraid I'm not really sure why I'm an admin of it at all :-)
18:40:02 <Riastradh> Who _is_ ESR?
18:40:03 <clausen> agreed
18:40:05 <Pseudonym> Threads are used to solve hard problems.
18:40:25 <clausen> Riastradh: he writes lots of rants that lots of people read
18:40:46 <Riastradh> Rather, what does ESR stand for?
18:40:48 <Pseudonym> It's precisely for those cases where it's not sequential and not easily separable.
18:40:50 <clausen> Pseudonym: agreed
18:40:54 <clausen> Riastradh: Eric Raymond
18:41:09 <Pseudonym> That's one reason why threads are so hard to use.  They're for solving hard concurrency/latency problems.
18:41:15 <Pseudonym> Heffalump: Which message is that?
18:41:29 <Pseudonym> Oh, I see.
18:41:32 <Pseudonym> I think.
18:42:01 <Heffalump> Subject: physical units for Haskell
18:42:09 <Pseudonym> Yes, got it.  Yeah, I'll reply.
18:42:24 <Pseudonym> I don't know why he mailed you.
18:42:25 <Heffalump> thanks
18:42:45 <Heffalump> shapr mentioned earlier that I'm an admin of the project, which if true I'd completely forgotten about
18:42:56 <Riastradh> Heh.
18:43:43 <Heffalump> ah, the webpage reckons it's me, shapr and Jens Petersen
18:46:19 <Pseudonym> I think the reason you're an admin is so you can add people if you want to.
18:48:36 <Heffalump> ah - it would be nice if I actually made some contribution, though :-)
18:48:51 <Heffalump> actually, speaking of which, I tried to hack lambdabot this weekend and got stuck.
18:53:32 <Pseudonym> Oh?
18:54:01 <Heffalump> well, I was trying to catch errors in modules in what I thought was the event loop
18:54:10 <Heffalump> but it all went horribly wrong
18:54:21 <Pseudonym> Did you notice that there are in fact three event loops?
18:54:37 <Heffalump> well, three threads, anyway, right?
18:54:41 <Pseudonym> Right.
18:54:44 <Heffalump> I'd only have called mainloop the event loop.
18:54:52 <Pseudonym> OK.
18:54:55 <Heffalump> since the others just do the reading and writing, rather than really "handling" things
18:55:00 <Heffalump> (as far as I could tell...)
18:55:18 <Pseudonym> There is one thing which they handle, and that's PING.
18:55:21 <Heffalump> ah, ok
18:55:25 <Heffalump> didn't read that closely :-)
18:55:32 <Pseudonym> That's by design.  The IRC protocol mandates that PING is handled as fast as possible.
18:55:39 <Heffalump> should ircRead block the mainloop thread until a message is available?
18:55:42 <Pseudonym> The three threads are mostly to handle that as a fast path.
18:55:52 <Pseudonym> Yes, it should.
18:55:58 <Heffalump> hmm. It doesn't seem to.
18:56:25 <Heffalump> if I stick a ircPrivmsg "#haskell" "foo" just after it, the bot seems to keep saying foo.
18:56:41 <Heffalump> (it's only on #haskell, and an empty one apart from me and it)
18:56:50 <Heffalump> not only that, but if I stick:
18:56:53 <Heffalump> ircPrivmsg "#haskell" (show msg)
18:57:03 <Heffalump> then the bot dies complaining that hGetChar failed or something
18:57:14 <Heffalump> which makes me think some kind of lazy IO is going on somewhere
18:57:45 <Pseudonym> This is using GHC or hugs?
18:58:01 <Heffalump> GHC
18:58:19 <Heffalump> GHC6, in fact - I had to poke the source a little bit to make it build at all
18:59:59 <Pseudonym> Yes, I'm finding that myself. :-)
19:01:00 <Heffalump> I think I switched GHC.Posix to System.Posix and gave up on one module
19:01:02 <Heffalump> Fortune
19:02:28 <Pseudonym> I think that lambdabot hasn't really been ported to GHC 6.0.
19:02:43 <Pseudonym> Let's see now...
19:04:12 <lambdabot2> foo
19:04:14 <lambdabot2> foo
19:04:16 <lambdabot2> foo
19:04:17 <Pseudonym> There you go.
19:04:18 <lambdabot2> foo
19:04:20 <lambdabot2> foo
19:04:28 <Pseudonym> Oh, I see the problem.
19:04:30 <Heffalump> I can do that trick too :-)
19:04:31 <Pseudonym> Duh.
19:04:37 <Pseudonym> It's obvious. :-)
19:04:46 <Heffalump> not to me :-)
19:05:01 <Pseudonym> Every time you say "foo", you get a reply from the IRC daemon.
19:05:10 <Pseudonym> Which is itself a message.
19:05:18 <Heffalump> errm, no you don't
19:05:26 <Heffalump> try it with telnet
19:06:16 <ganesh> boing
19:06:26 <Heffalump> yep, it doesn't echo your own messages back to you
19:06:51 <Heffalump> and try replacing "foo" with (show msg)
19:09:40 <Pseudonym> It kicked me for flodding.
19:10:03 <Heffalump> what did?
19:10:10 <Pseudonym> The server.
19:10:14 <Heffalump> what did you do?
19:10:32 <Pseudonym> I got it to send me privmsgs.
19:10:49 <Heffalump> how?
19:11:01 <Pseudonym> ircPrivmsg "Pseudonym" (show msg)
19:11:49 <Heffalump> OIC, the bot, right.
19:11:56 <Heffalump> what were the msgs before it got kicked?
19:12:06 <Pseudonym> *lambdabot2* IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "", msgCommand = "NOTICE", msgParams =
19:12:07 <Pseudonym> +["AUTH",":*** Looking up your hostname..."]}
19:12:13 <Pseudonym> *lambdabot2* IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "", msgCommand = "NOTICE", msgParams =
19:12:14 <Pseudonym> +["AUTH",":*** Found your hostname, welcome back"]}
19:12:17 <Pseudonym> *lambdabot2* IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "", msgCommand = "NOTICE", msgParams =
19:12:17 <Pseudonym> +["AUTH",":*** Checking ident"]}
19:12:19 <Pseudonym> And that's it.
19:12:26 <Pseudonym> Let me stick in a little hack...
19:12:33 <Heffalump> oh, so it was still sending the beginning messages
19:12:47 <Heffalump> oh, that might explain the flood of foos - it was still catching up with the start of things
19:12:53 <Heffalump> I should test it for longer.
19:12:54 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:12:58 <Pseudonym> I've replaced it with this:
19:13:03 <Pseudonym> chans <- ircGetChannels
19:13:03 <Pseudonym> case chans of
19:13:03 <Pseudonym>     [] -> return ()
19:13:03 <Pseudonym>     _  -> ircPrivmsg "#haskell" (show msg)
19:13:14 <lambdabot2> IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "leguin.freenode.net", msgCommand = "332", msgParams = ["lambdabot2","#haskell",":[\"We put the Funk in Funktion\",\"See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/\",\"Learning Haskell - http://www.haskell.org/learning.html\",\"http://haskell.org/~petersen/rpms/\",\"lots of cool debs in the haskell-experimental archive - see http://haskell.org/hawiki/DebianUsers\"]"]}
19:13:14 <lambdabot2> IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "leguin.freenode.net", msgCommand = "333", msgParams = ["lambdabot2","#haskell","Heffalump","1058649190"]}

19:13:30 <Igloo> When does it die?
19:13:37 <Pseudonym> That's not so bad.
19:13:38 <Heffalump> on startup for me, IIRC.
19:13:38 <Igloo> Oh, just randomly?
19:13:47 <Heffalump> what killed it just now?
19:13:53 <Pseudonym> ^C
19:13:57 <Igloo> Oh, OK
19:14:11 <Heffalump> I suggest testing somewhere a bit quieter
19:14:20 * Pseudonym nods
19:14:36 <Pseudonym> I'll be on #haskell2 if you need me. :-)
19:14:41 <Heffalump> 'k :-)
19:14:47 <Riastradh> No, #joy!
19:14:53 * Heffalump goes to watch and keep quiet
19:15:14 <Igloo> aol
19:15:50 <Igloo> Heff: So does it crash without that line there or what?
19:16:33 <Heffalump> hangon a sec
19:17:27 <Pseudonym> I think you're just impatient.
19:17:42 <Heffalump> maybe, gimme a sec :-)
19:18:24 <Heffalump> ok, inserting:
19:18:29 <Heffalump>  ircPrivmsg "#haskell" (show msg)
19:18:33 <Heffalump> just after msg <- ircRead
19:18:40 <Pseudonym> OK
19:18:44 <Heffalump> causes this:
19:18:51 <Heffalump> ganesh@musketeer:~/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot$ ./Main
19:18:51 <Heffalump> Running reader loop...
19:18:51 <Heffalump> Exception: end of file
19:18:51 <Heffalump> Action: hGetChar
19:18:51 <Heffalump> Handle: {loc=<socket: 3>,type=duplex (read-write),binary=True,buffering=none}
19:18:54 <Heffalump> File: <socket: 3>
19:19:04 <Heffalump> immediately - no sign of it joining the channel or anything
19:19:26 <Pseudonym> Hang on.
19:19:42 <Heffalump> oh, I'll try what you said above.
19:20:08 <Pseudonym> Yeah.  I pasted it here:
19:20:16 <Pseudonym> http://www.nomorepasting.com/paste.php?pasteID=6696
19:20:24 <Pseudonym> That gives the bot a chance to actually open the socket.
19:20:28 * Igloo wonders where Heff's tree is
19:20:58 <Heffalump> right, yeah, I'd not thought of that - I think it was the fact that the error is in hGetChar that confused me
19:21:06 <Heffalump> igloo: ~ganesh/haskell-libs/lib/lambdabot on musketeer
19:21:24 <Heffalump> right, yes, that works fine.
19:21:35 <Igloo> Ah, yes, that makes sense
19:21:44 <Heffalump> the error being in hGetChar?
19:22:02 <Igloo> Presumably the server is closing the connection when you send a message before giving nick etc
19:22:14 <Heffalump> ohhh
19:22:34 <Heffalump> nope.
19:22:36 <Heffalump> It doesn't do that.
19:23:11 <Heffalump> but a /kill of the client causes the same symptoms, which implies that it is getting disconnected unexpectedly.
19:23:44 <Pseudonym> Could be that the irc server has decided that you're a serial flooder or something.
19:23:46 <Igloo> Well, that's what an end of file on the socket would mean
19:23:49 <Pseudonym> Might want to try a different node.
19:23:51 <Heffalump> oh, good point.
19:24:18 * Heffalump gets back to trying to get his exception catcher to work
19:24:31 <Igloo> Euch, no Makefile
19:24:40 <Heffalump> 'fraid not, no
19:25:18 <Pseudonym> If syntaxpolice is watching, hurry up on the damn build infrastructure. :-)
19:25:34 <Heffalump> if I have something of type IRC () -> IRC () that catches exceptions in its argument, putting it around (f msg) in allCallbacks should protect against errors coming from modules, shouldn't it?
19:26:16 <Pseudonym> I dunno.  Lambdabot has changed a bit since I first wrote it.
19:26:36 <Pseudonym> Probably should put in a catch-like thing.
19:26:44 <Heffalump> well, that's what I'm trying to do :-)
19:26:56 <Heffalump> there's something at the very top level, but that is too late to stop the bot dying
19:27:04 * Pseudonym nods
19:27:59 * Heffalump fumes
19:28:18 <Heffalump> either my exception catching doesn't catch anything, or it stops the bot doing anything...
19:29:39 <Pseudonym> Is it an IO exception?
19:29:48 <Heffalump> my catching should catch any kind
19:29:55 <Heffalump> I tested it (minimally) using ghci
19:30:44 <Heffalump> http://www.nomorepasting.com/paste.php?pasteID=6697
19:31:06 <Heffalump> (no, it's not, it's a proper "error" call, caused by tail [])
19:32:13 <Pseudonym> That looks riht.
19:32:43 <Pseudonym> What happens when you then throw an exception?
19:33:01 * Igloo offers Heff ~igloo/lb/lambdabot/Makefile to commit
19:33:22 <Heffalump> igloo: I did an anonymous checkout, I didn't remember I was actually a developer on the project :-)
19:33:35 <Heffalump> anyway, you seem to be listed as a developer too
19:33:37 <Igloo> Oh  :-)
19:33:43 <Pseudonym> Lunch.  You guys figure it out. :-)
19:33:57 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: when the bot throws one, it seems to just fail to catch it
19:34:03 <Heffalump> cya
19:38:38 <Igloo> I'm fairly sure it is getting flooded off
19:38:43 <Igloo> It's answering the whole MOTD
19:38:56 <Igloo> Ah, yes
19:38:57 <Igloo> IRCMessage {msgPrefix = "", msgCommand = "ERROR", msgParams = [":Closing Link
19:38:57 <Igloo> : Iglambda (Excess Flood)"]}
19:38:57 <Igloo> Exception: end of file
19:38:57 <Igloo> Action: hGetChar
19:39:09 <Heffalump> right, cool
19:39:22 * Heffalump is more bothered about his exception problems now :-)
19:39:51 <Igloo> Which is protect?
19:40:06 <Heffalump> wdym "which"?
19:40:29 <Igloo> The exception handling code you are working on is protect?
19:40:39 <Heffalump> well, I wrote that, yes
20:15:43 <Heffalump> Pseudonym: for when you return, we've figured it out :-)
20:16:20 <Heffalump> the error value is actually passed intact to ircWrite embedded in an IRCMessage, which happily sends it across the channel to writerLoop
20:17:19 <Heffalump> writerLoop is the one that actually causes the error to be raised when it tries to evaluate the IRCMessage to make a string, and it catches exceptions and throws them back across to mainloop
20:17:31 <Heffalump> so the exception actually arrives at a point I wasn't expecting at all
20:46:32 * Pseudonym is back
20:46:42 <Pseudonym> Aha.  That makes sense.
20:48:47 <Pseudonym> The solution, then, I think, is to get ircWrite to deepSeq its message.
20:49:11 <Pseudonym> Should probably do that anyway.
20:57:06 <Smerdyakov> Ooooooh, sounds pornographic.
20:59:22 <Pseudonym> deepSeq, starring Sparky Melrose
20:59:37 <Pseudonym> (That's my porn star name, incidentally.)
21:02:27 <Strike> <--- Joey 
21:02:29 <Strike> bah
21:02:31 <Strike> <--- Joey Weymouth
21:02:34 <Strike> is my porn star name
22:21:06 <dennisb> Could someone help me with an english word. I want to know if there is a special name for a crossword puzzle where you have numbers in each square, and each square with the same number shall have the same letter in the solution. In sweden these kinds of puzzles have a special name called "krypto". Is there an english name to distinguish it from normal crossword puzzles?
22:21:21 <dennisb> It's very OT, but I think it's OT in every channel :-)
22:23:28 <Pseudonym> I think it's called whatever the newspaper calls it.
22:23:42 <Pseudonym> I've seen it called by several names, none of which spring to mind right now.
22:24:53 <dennisb> Aha, different from sweden then where it has one name. Then of course each newspaper gives each puzzle a name also, but the are all cryptos (if it had been a word in english)
22:25:56 <dennisb> It might explain why I havn't been able to find it in a dictionary or by using google
22:38:43 <Pseudonym> I've seen the term "codeword" used in more than one paper, actually.
22:39:25 <clausen> "codeword" is also used in prefix-free codes
22:39:27 <clausen> (compression)
22:39:40 <Pseudonym> Or even non-prefix-free codes.
22:39:52 <clausen> yep
22:39:57 <clausen> (are they interesting?)
22:40:01 <Pseudonym> In information theory it just refers to a symbol or sequence thereof/.
22:40:10 <Pseudonym> Sure.
22:40:14 <Pseudonym> The alternative is usually block codes.
22:40:28 <Pseudonym> Not necessarily interesting fromt he point of view of compression.
22:40:34 <clausen> aha
22:40:39 <Pseudonym> But, for example, error correcting codes are block codes.
22:40:54 <clausen> you mean hamming codes?
22:41:16 <Pseudonym> That's one kind.
22:41:30 <Pseudonym> Reed-Solomon codes, convolution codes...
22:41:33 <Pseudonym> Lots of possibilities.
22:43:26 <Pseudonym> There are also general transmission codes, used to identify frames and so on.
22:43:41 <Pseudonym> e.g. the simple 8-N-1 code beloved by modems everywhere
22:44:06 * clausen is seperating out his thereom into thereom + lemma
22:44:19 <clausen> very challenging :)
22:44:32 <clausen> (and enlightening)
22:45:03 * clausen wishes probability / stochastic processes was taught in a "pure" way in 2nd year
22:47:54 <Pseudonym> Refactoring Theorems
22:47:59 <Pseudonym> Sounds like a lesser known XP book.
22:48:05 <clausen> hehe
22:48:47 <clausen> most computer scientists have crap maths skills
22:48:52 <clausen> (and most good ones have very good skills)
22:49:07 <clausen> hence, I think it's worthwhile spending time on maths...
22:49:37 <Pseudonym> It depends on the computer scientist.
22:49:52 <clausen> I spent last week at an agents conference (AAMAS)
22:49:53 <Pseudonym> I've found most of the ones around MU actually have good maths skills, with notable exceptions.
22:49:58 <Pseudonym> Most of them have no practical skills.
22:50:19 <Pseudonym> Ah, well, there's your problem.
22:50:29 <Pseudonym> AI researchers have no maths skills.  It's a well-known fact.
22:50:43 <clausen> agents >> AI
22:50:51 <clausen> mechanism design ppl have good maths skills
22:50:57 <Pseudonym> However, you can't hang around MU without noticing that logic programmers tend to be not bad at maths.
22:51:04 <clausen> indeed
22:51:45 <Pseudonym> The fact that most of them use it to find yet another semantics for the Prolog cut is beside the point. :-)
22:52:04 <clausen> LOL
22:52:19 <Pseudonym> You think I'm joking.
22:52:55 <clausen> there doesn't seem to be *that* much energy in that direction...
22:53:09 <Pseudonym> I think people are finally giving up.
22:53:24 <Pseudonym> Not on Prolog, but on pretending that the cut actually means something logical.
22:53:55 <Pseudonym> Lee Naish at least had the honesty to find replacements for cut.
22:56:02 <Pseudonym> Do you know T.Y. Chen?
22:56:08 <clausen> no
22:56:17 <Pseudonym> Dunno if he's still there or not.
22:56:25 <Pseudonym> I don't think he teaches undergrads.
22:56:38 <Pseudonym> Anyway, he does some really interesting research into software testing.
22:57:45 <Pseudonym> Lots of maths and statistics.  You'd like it.
22:58:01 <clausen> can't see him on the dept staff list
22:58:26 <Pseudonym> Looks like he might be back in Hong Kong now.
22:58:45 <clausen> my girlfriend is into maths and stats :)
22:58:59 <clausen> (maths hons student)
22:59:01 <Pseudonym> He's come up with a number of neat theorems about, for example, how many errors you expect to find when you test a program a certain way.
22:59:06 <Pseudonym> And how to pick test cases.
22:59:34 <clausen> interesting
22:59:37 <Pseudonym> His ideas are based on testing as statistical sampling of the program's input space.
23:00:16 <Pseudonym> Also he's done some recent stuff on how to reduce the size of a test suite while keeping its effectiveness.
23:00:25 <Pseudonym> Fascinating stuff.
23:00:29 <clausen> indeed
23:00:34 <Pseudonym> (He tried to poach me from Mercury a few years ago.)
23:01:04 <clausen> so, I've basically been offered a PhD scholarship in North Carolina State Uni
23:01:21 <clausen> (with a guy who's into agents/ecommerce, to do trust-type-stuff)
23:01:31 <Pseudonym> Interesting.
23:01:35 * clausen wondering what to do with his life
23:01:46 <clausen> also, another guy in barcelona
23:01:51 <Pseudonym> Well I'm not sure if North Carolina is necessarily where you want to spend it. :-)
23:02:01 <clausen> rayleigh is good
23:02:05 <clausen> not traditional Deep South
23:02:09 <Pseudonym> Oh, OK.
23:02:12 <clausen> also, Red Hat is across the road
23:02:17 <clausen> (literally)
23:02:54 <clausen> (university towns are Different TM)
23:03:22 <Pseudonym> Tell me about it.
23:03:37 <Pseudonym> My wife most recently (before Melbourne, obviously) lived in Champaign-Urbana.
23:03:54 <Pseudonym> University town if there ever was one.
23:04:03 <Pseudonym> Of course it's also the second-biggest tech centre in the US.
23:04:18 <Pseudonym> She worked in the same building as Stephen Wolfram.
23:04:40 <clausen> you've got a nerd wife too?  *grin*
23:04:49 <Pseudonym> Well... geek.
23:05:02 <Pseudonym> She's actually a graphic designer who just happened to be an ISP support tech at the time.
23:06:10 <clausen> btw, did you have a good read of my article yet?
23:06:44 <Pseudonym> I skimmed the maths. :-)
23:06:59 * Pseudonym didn't have a chance to look at that part closely
23:08:32 <clausen> did it look convincing/plausable as you skimmed?
23:08:59 <Pseudonym> Plausible enough, yes.
23:09:15 <Pseudonym> The guy who is working on ranking here said maybe we could turn it into a revenue stream.
23:09:31 <clausen> ?
23:09:46 <Pseudonym> You know I work in text retrieval.
23:09:56 <Pseudonym> There's someone here who is updating our ranking algorithms.
23:10:05 <clausen> oh, I didn't know
23:10:14 <Pseudonym> If we could find a way to turn money into ranking, that'd be great for us.
23:10:24 <Pseudonym> You give us money, we give you ranking.
23:10:50 <clausen> why is that a hard problem?
23:11:00 <clausen> (just boost the document weight?)
23:11:09 <Pseudonym> No, it's a joke.
23:11:27 <clausen> ah, ok :)
23:11:41 <Pseudonym> Ranking is a hard problem, though.
23:11:50 <Pseudonym> Especially if you have multiple databases which you want to rank together.
23:13:12 <Pseudonym> LOL
23:13:21 <Pseudonym> I just saw the new bit on the quotes page.
23:44:02 <reffie> anyone here know a little about US visas, by any chance?
