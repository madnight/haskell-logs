01:35:40 * Marvin-- whines and whimpers
01:41:37 <Marvin--> I want a cvs fix-cvs-induced-breakage command
03:32:51 <basti_> hi all
05:03:21 <Janni> morning
05:03:27 <basti_> good morning Janni
05:04:05 <Janni> quite hard to write with an ice-cream in one hand...
05:04:07 <mgoetze> hi Janni, how are you?
05:04:33 <Janni> hmm, how am I?
05:05:08 <Janni> I think I'm feeling really good
05:05:58 <Janni> It's hard to say somehow if the day is so young
05:12:02 <mgoetze> lol, i got up 4 hours ago, but only because i had a 30-hour-awake stretch before that ending around 8 pm :)
07:04:02 <shapr> oy
07:04:13 <shapr> gooood morning #haskell!
07:05:49 <shapr> what's shakin?
07:05:51 <mgoetze> good afternoon, shae :)
07:06:25 <shapr> how's life mgoetze?
07:07:13 <mgoetze> sunny
07:07:23 <mgoetze> making it somewhat difficult to see things on my monitor :)
07:07:25 * shapr opens the blinds
07:08:04 <shapr> mmm, sun
07:08:55 <mgoetze> i have a diagonal window which makes it difficult to put anything in the way
07:09:01 <shapr> sounds nifty
07:11:51 * Riastradh is Scheming.
07:12:02 * shapr is awakening
07:12:09 <Riastradh> Hey, close the window!  It's blinding me!
07:12:14 <mgoetze> nifty, but sunny
07:18:33 * Riastradh Schemes a hash table implementation.
07:32:42 <shapr> goood morning Isaac!
07:35:31 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: it's easter. surely you can play go over easter? :)
07:36:22 <SyntaxPolice> hi shapr & mgoetze!
07:36:41 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: good question... its good friday today :-)... will you be around this afternoon?
07:37:23 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: well, actually, i'll be at the chess cafe playing go :)
07:37:31 <mgoetze> SyntaxPolice: easter sunday or easter monday perhaps?
07:38:24 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: problem is that I will be out of town and probably not have internet access (gasp!) I'm going home to visit my folks
07:38:52 <mgoetze> oh, darn
07:39:18 <mgoetze> when will you be back?
07:40:12 <SyntaxPolice> sunday night (eastern "standard" time) or monday
07:40:26 <mgoetze> yeah, well, we can play on monday i hope :)
07:40:31 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: I'm happy about the wiki. looks good.
07:40:33 <SyntaxPolice> mgoetze: cool :)
07:44:18 <shapr> yay wiki!
07:47:49 * shapr rereads tmoertel's seven lessons
07:49:55 <shapr> hey, it's time to organize teams for this year's ICFP
07:50:00 <Riastradh> OOH!
07:50:12 * Riastradh explodes out of his seat.
07:50:16 <shapr> I'd like to have at least one #haskell team
07:50:43 <shapr> Riastradh: eh?
07:50:45 <SyntaxPolice> when is ICFP?
07:50:51 <Riastradh> Do we know a basic idea of what the thing will be?
07:51:00 <Igloo> No
07:51:06 <Riastradh> Damn.
07:51:08 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: usually "some amount of time before the actual meeting"
07:51:13 <shapr> Riastradh: that's part of the fun
07:51:36 <shapr> the contest is announced, then you have three days to write entries
07:51:37 <mgoetze> how many people per team, how much time?
07:51:40 <Igloo> Is there a competition page yet?
07:51:45 <shapr> I don't think so
07:51:51 <Igloo> 72 hours isn't it?
07:52:01 <Igloo> And any number
07:52:04 <Riastradh> Well, yes, but, er, I haven't the foggiest idea how to do some things, like the ray tracer the contest was about a couple years ago, or the pathfinder gizmo for last year's.
07:52:05 <shapr> but after reading tmoertel's seven ICFP lessons, I decided I'd start organizing now :-)
07:52:30 <Riastradh> What are his seven ICFP lessons?
07:52:50 <shapr> http://www.moertel.com/~thor/icfp2001/k5-icfp.html
07:53:34 <Igloo> I would suggest one person with a reasonable knowledge of Haskell to coordinate everything and make sure it works together, and probably someone with knowledge in the appropriate area to do the algorithmy bits (or more than one if it's complex)
07:54:08 <mgoetze> i might help out if i can
07:54:29 <shapr> I nominate Igloo as coordinator ;-)
07:54:45 * Igloo might be in a uni team if that happens
07:54:54 <shapr> actually Igloo and Heffalump wrote the largest part of last year's entry
07:55:35 <shapr> Igloo: yah, an in-the-same-room team would have a better chance
07:55:41 <Igloo> What we should have done last year is to get a really stupid bot sooner and then had multiple heuristics done by different people and competed them against each other
07:56:00 <shapr> yah, I agree
07:56:40 * Igloo would lose hours going home and back for an in-the-same-room team unfortunately
07:57:03 <Igloo> I could suggest extreme programming to Oege, though (e.g. pair programming)
07:57:11 <shapr> yah!
07:57:35 <shapr> do you think Oege will participate in the next ICFP?
07:57:36 * SyntaxPolice could probably get at least one same-room pair here.
07:58:32 <Igloo> I think it was him who suggested a research group team
07:59:50 <shapr> I'd like to figure out team organization in time to have some warmups
08:01:50 <shapr> for example, six hours to write a pong game :-)
08:03:01 <shapr> Riastradh: student members of icfp team winners get free entrance, I think
08:03:01 <SyntaxPolice> you could add info about proposed teams to the Channel part of the wiki.
08:03:21 * Riastradh hyperventilates.
08:04:13 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: good idea, I will
08:04:14 <shapr> hiya hroptatyr 
08:04:31 <shapr> hroptatyr: know anything about Bayesian statistics? ;-)
08:04:48 * shapr gives a paper bag to Riastradh 
08:05:25 <shapr> hey, it's saturday morning in the US, right?
08:05:40 <mgoetze> shapr: no, friday morning
08:05:41 <Riastradh> No, Friday morning.
08:05:46 <shapr> oh, right
08:05:47 <shapr> duh
08:05:58 <shapr> :-)
08:06:14 <Riastradh> Were it Saturday morning, I'd be away teaching a class, and I therefore wouldn't be present to hyperventilate about the ICFP.
08:06:29 <shapr> what class do you teach?
08:06:36 <Riastradh> An introductory Scheme class.
08:06:40 <shapr> nifty!
08:06:44 <hroptatyr> shapr: Bayesian statistics? lol :)
08:06:48 <mgoetze> it should be an introductory haskell class, of course :)
08:07:10 <shapr> I taught an introductory TCP/IP class once.
08:07:21 <Riastradh> But I know Scheme far better than Haskell.
08:07:27 <mgoetze> Riastradh: do you, uhm, forget to tell them about set! and other vile non-fp things? :)
08:07:53 <shapr> hroptatyr: want to learn Haskell? looking for other Haskell users?
08:08:01 <shapr> hroptatyr: just here for the spam filter? :-)
08:08:04 <Riastradh> mgoetze - I'm trying to avoid it.  They somehow managed to figure it out themselves, though.
08:08:15 <mgoetze> lol
08:08:19 <hroptatyr> shapr: no, actually I'm looking for you! :)
08:08:26 <mgoetze> well, at least they can figure things out :)
08:08:26 <shapr> oh!
08:08:27 <shapr> wow!
08:08:39 <shapr> hroptatyr: what can I do for you?
08:08:43 <hroptatyr> shapr: I have some questions about the HToolkit stuff.
08:08:52 <shapr> hroptatyr: ok, what questions?
08:09:20 <hroptatyr> shapr: or, let's say problems, I cannot compile pgsql into it, (for the use with the lambdabot)
08:09:42 <hroptatyr> the configure script is sort of malfunctioned
08:09:50 <shapr> yah, it is
08:10:01 <Riastradh> shapr - Ack, you haven't made the 'fact' module just write to the disk?
08:10:17 <shapr> unless they've changed it, you need to add the autoconf version declaration to the top of the autoconf script
08:10:25 <shapr> I submitted a patch for that
08:10:30 <shapr> there were a few other changes also
08:10:35 <shapr> Riastradh: nope, not yet
08:10:47 * shapr checks his local diffs
08:10:47 <hroptatyr> 'kay, I will look for that ... :)
08:11:57 * hroptatyr cvs updates the HToolkit ...
08:12:27 <shapr> hroptatyr: I added "AC_PREREQ(2.53)" on line 3 of configure.in
08:12:44 <hroptatyr> 'kay I'm trying
08:13:31 <shapr> and in HToolkit/Database/PostgreSQL/HSQL.hsc I changed "mkSqlType (#const ZPBITOID)	   	size = SqlBit size" to "mkSqlType (#const BITOID)	   	size = SqlBit size"
08:13:52 <hroptatyr> :)
08:14:26 * shapr is tempted to ask for cvs privs in HToolkit so he can fix it himself
08:14:39 <hroptatyr> hehe
08:17:30 <shapr> hi tmoertel!
08:17:37 <tmoertel> hi, shapr !
08:17:38 <shapr> hello Arnia 
08:17:46 <shapr> tmoertel: hey, I've been reading your Seven ICFP Lessons
08:18:08 <shapr> Time to organize teams
08:18:10 <tmoertel> I wonder how many of the Seven I've forgotten by now ;-)
08:18:29 <shapr> if we can get teams organize, we can do warmups like the mini-contest you held recently
08:18:46 <tmoertel> Only 5 or so months to the contest . . 
08:19:02 <shapr> tmoertel: with my organizational skills, that's just enough time!
08:19:09 <Igloo> :-)
08:20:00 <shapr> hroptatyr: I'll fix @fact to optionally use flat files
08:20:08 <shapr> hroptatyr: probably will take me a few days
08:20:15 <Riastradh> A few days!?
08:20:54 <Riastradh> readFacts =
08:21:06 <Riastradh>     do fileExists <- doesFileExist <fact file path>
08:21:12 <shapr> Riastradh: ok, do it ;-)
08:21:12 <Riastradh>        if fileExists then
08:21:12 <hroptatyr> :o days?
08:21:16 * Igloo rereads the template-haskell list and wonders if I should send a mail saying I'm about to start making the changes
08:21:24 <Riastradh>           do handle <- openFile <fact file path> ReadMode
08:21:26 <Riastradh> ...
08:21:32 <Igloo> It's not entirely clear so I guess I might as well
08:21:40 <Riastradh> It's ten lines of simple Haskell code.
08:21:52 <Riastradh> writeFacts is even shorter -- four lines.
08:21:53 <shapr> Riastradh: that's great, write it up ;-)
08:22:00 <Igloo> You'll need to catch a DoesNotExist exception anyway or you have a race condition
08:22:24 <Riastradh> Igloo - Why would I need to catch DoesNotExist?  I explicitly check to see if it exists.
08:22:41 <Igloo> But it might be deleted between that and opening it
08:23:19 <Riastradh> The likelihood of that happening is so small that if you manage to do it you deserve to have lambdabot bork.
08:23:55 <Igloo> It's a bug.
08:24:07 <Riastradh> Besides, I don't know how exceptions work in Haskell.
08:24:25 <Igloo> Then you have a chance to learn something new  :-)
08:25:09 * shapr grins
08:25:21 <shapr> take a few days is not that it would take me very long to write the code
08:25:44 <shapr> just that a) my head is full of spam filtering right now, and b) I promised to spend large chunks of time away from the computer with my woman
08:26:09 <shapr> my inbox is full of lack of spam filtering at the moment.
08:27:20 <Riastradh> See, b) is why I avoid women.  I get to stay with my computer as much as I want!
08:27:46 * mgoetze is not entirely convinced by Riastradh's argumentation
08:27:55 <Riastradh> Argumentation?
08:28:22 <mgoetze> Riastradh: "I get to stay with my computer as much as I want!" is an argument for avoiding women, is it not?
08:28:38 <Riastradh> Yes, but what's 'argumentation?'
08:29:12 <mgoetze>      1. The act of forming reasons, making inductions, drawing
08:29:12 <mgoetze>         conclusions, and applying them to the case in discussion;
08:29:43 <Riastradh> Hmm.
08:29:50 <mgoetze>      2. Debate; discussion.
08:30:13 <Riastradh> What dictionary is this from?
08:30:14 <shapr> SyntaxPolice: cute message
08:30:22 <mgoetze> Riastradh: 1913 webster's
08:30:27 <Riastradh> Disgusting.
08:30:31 * Riastradh looks it up in the OED.
08:31:07 <mgoetze> Riastradh: if you'd care to name me a dict server where i can look things up from the OED... ;)
08:32:04 <Riastradh> Curses, it's in the OED.
08:32:20 <SyntaxPolice> shapr: :-)
08:32:51 * tmoertel goes to eath lunch
08:33:27 <mgoetze> Riastradh: if you're trying to discriminate against me based on my lacking command of the english language, forget it. i mean, even if you did succeed, i'd get to call you a racist. :)
08:33:49 <Riastradh> Er, but knowledge of language has nothing to do with race.
08:35:31 <mgoetze> Riastradh: well, me being german and all, my mother tongue is german, a trait i mostly share only with other german people, so in a sense picking on people based on that trait could be construed as racism
08:35:48 <Riastradh> Well, how was I supposed to know you're German?
08:35:58 * Arnia bounces
08:36:05 <Arnia> @yow
08:36:06 <lambdabot> When I met th'POPE back in '58, I scrubbed him with a MILD SOAP
08:36:06 <lambdabot>  or DETERGENT for 15 minutes.  He seemed to enjoy it..
08:36:09 <Riastradh> And how do you know I'm not German as well?
08:36:24 <hroptatyr> shapr: he still does not want to accept my postgres.h (latest cvs build of pg)
08:36:29 <hroptatyr> :(
08:36:47 <mgoetze> lambdabot: @fact mgoetze
08:36:47 <lambdabot> Michael Goetze, fanatical Go player, from Germany.
08:36:57 <mgoetze> Riastradh: see, it's public knowledge :)
08:37:58 <Riastradh> Yes, but I never looked at that fact, so hah!
08:38:14 <Riastradh> And you also haven't answered the question about my possibly being German.
08:38:45 <mgoetze> 15:38 [freenode] -!- Riastradh [~riastradh@pool-141-154-233-43.bos.east.verizon.net]
08:38:59 <Riastradh> I might be IRCing through a guy's box near Boston.
08:39:11 <mgoetze> well, people don't usually do that :)
08:39:20 <Riastradh> Or maybe I moved to the U.S.
08:41:20 <mgoetze> Riastradh: also, i don't know of many germans who would consult the OED
08:41:34 <Riastradh> Maybe they're English majors.
08:41:58 <Riastradh> Or they just happen to know about authority upon the English language.
08:42:25 <mgoetze> bah, that's not what i meant to do
08:42:48 <mgoetze> Riastradh: also, from this channel: 18:17  * Riastradh flings the most vile and vulgar curses he knows at Verizon.
08:43:09 <mgoetze> Riastradh: which would contradict the idea that you were sshing into someone else's box to irc
08:43:44 <mgoetze> Riastradh: and you wouldn't be teaching courses on saturday afternoon here in germany
08:43:45 <Riastradh> No, because I can still be angry that Verizon disconnected that guy's box.
08:43:54 <Riastradh> Oh?  Why not?
08:44:13 <mgoetze> Riastradh: noone teaches courses on saturday afternoon on a regular basis in germany! :)
08:44:29 <Riastradh> Maybe I do!  Hah!  I've run rings around you logically!
08:44:56 <mgoetze> Riastradh: i'm only mentioning circumstancial evidence, of course, but it amounts to quite a bit
08:45:03 <mgoetze> Riastradh: now, tell me, are you german? :)
08:45:08 <Riastradh> Well, no.
08:46:54 <Riastradh> ...silence...
08:47:00 <shapr> hroptatyr: I'll fix the @fact module to use a flat file tomorrow
08:47:05 <shapr> unless Riastradh fixes it today ;-)
08:47:21 <hroptatyr> shapr: 'kay. thanks :)
08:47:55 <shapr> and I'll ask to be added to HToolkit as a developer and release manager
08:48:53 <hroptatyr> yepp. :)
08:49:31 <shapr> hroptatyr: any feedback on lambdabot otherwise?
08:50:18 <hroptatyr> shapr: yeah, it is doing _exactly_ what I've wanted ... :)
08:50:21 <basti_> *g*
08:50:30 <hroptatyr> using an sql-backend
08:51:36 <hroptatyr> shapr: and it will lead me to learn haskell, I hope ... :)
08:52:31 <shapr> hroptatyr: yay!
08:52:41 <hroptatyr> @yow
08:52:42 <lambdabot> I've read SEVEN MILLION books!!
08:53:09 <shapr> I don't think @yow is in the tarball, I think it's only in lambdabot cvs
08:54:11 <shapr> @listmodules
08:54:12 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["eval","fact","fortune","hello","karma","more","searchml","state","system","topic","type","yow"]
08:54:13 <hroptatyr> lambdabot has cvs?
08:54:39 <Riastradh> @fact haskell-libs
08:54:40 <lambdabot> http://sourceforge.net/projects/haskell-libs/
08:54:52 <Riastradh> That's where the lambdabot CVS stuff resides.
08:55:02 <hdaume> morning
08:55:28 <Riastradh> Hi.
08:55:32 <shapr> @fact source
08:55:32 <lambdabot>  http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/, http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot/
08:55:33 <shapr> hiya hal
08:57:27 <shapr> well, I'm off for an evening of warcraft II, movies, women, and alcohol
08:58:05 <hroptatyr> shapr: have fun
08:58:08 <shapr> :-)
08:58:12 <shapr> be back tomorra
08:58:21 * shapr goes off for påsklov
08:58:49 <Riastradh> Hmmm.
08:59:07 <Riastradh> There ought to be able to be multiple facts for one fact key.
09:02:11 <Riastradh> Is there a good description of how I do exceptions?
09:04:16 <hdaume> Riastradh: just ask :)
09:04:33 <hdaume> look at functions try, catch and bracket in Control.Exception.  their types should tell you a lot :)
09:05:27 * SyntaxPolice bangs head against Hugs makefile
09:05:37 <SyntaxPolice> s/makefile/make system
09:51:29 <Riastradh> @yow
09:51:29 <lambdabot> You mean you don't want to watch WRESTLING from ATLANTA?
10:01:57 <Riastradh> Yuck, all the code still uses 'moduleInit' and not 'moduleLoad'/'moduleUnload'!
10:06:11 <Riastradh> @type words
10:06:11 <lambdabot> words :: String -> [String]
10:33:16 <mgoetze> @type moduleInit
10:34:02 <Riastradh> moduleInit is a lambdabot thing, not a Haskell function.
10:34:29 <mgoetze> @type map
10:34:29 <lambdabot> map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
10:34:52 <mgoetze> Riastradh: you mean to say that lambdabot things are not haskell functions?
10:35:52 <Riastradh> They're not in hugs by default.
10:47:36 * Riastradh hmms.
12:16:40 <Riastradh> @yow
12:16:40 <lambdabot> That's a decision that can only be made between you & SY SPERLING!!
12:44:09 <SyntaxPolice_> I got the new hugs package to build & run, but its ugly... now I will clean it up.
12:50:49 <delYsid> shapr: last chance was this 64 EUR USB-to-USB network cable, which turned out to be not-working under Linux, and probably very complicated to link win->Linux :/
12:57:49 <Riastradh> Hrumph.
12:57:55 <Riastradh> lambdabot's module unloading doesn't exactly work.
14:56:56 <Janni> @yow
14:56:57 <lambdabot> Kids, don't gross me off..  ``Adventures with MENTAL HYGIENE''
14:56:57 <lambdabot>  can be carried too FAR!
15:34:42 <Arnia> Wahay!
15:35:19 <basti_> hi Arnia
15:47:50 <Arnia> You only ever see one of them at a time... *ponders*
16:09:50 <Janni> Arnia: Your observation is wrong by the way:
16:09:51 <Janni> 07:32:47 <shapr> Darius: keep those mental muscles strong
16:10:55 <Darius> lambda pumping
16:11:45 <Arnia> Damn... I'd hoped I'd found a sneaky quick change trick. Germany to Sweeden isn't far ;)
16:13:16 <mgoetze> eh what?
16:45:21 <argv[0]> anyone studing in netherlands?
16:46:21 <mgoetze> lots of people, i'm sure, but /me is studying in .de
16:48:23 <argv[0]> i'm from portugal. i'm wondering how much does a student pay for a year in a public university (gratuity) in other countrys in europe?
16:52:44 <argv[0]> i gess this is too much offtopic so I'll set u free from my 'l4m3' nick
