02:02:16 <pesco> Moin moin!
03:02:24 <Segora> hi
03:02:49 <polli> hi
03:40:18 <delYsid> hmm
03:40:29 <delYsid> How does a Haskell Stack Overflow happen?
03:40:46 <delYsid> I mean, what is usually an indicator for such a thing? (code-wise, not error-message-wise)
03:41:37 <Igloo> Well, it's deep recursion, but that might be hidden by higher level functions
03:41:45 <Igloo> Have you tried cutting the code down to find a minimal example?
03:52:19 <Darius> Is cBoard or testMe cause the stack overflow?  I haven't tried playing but nothing has caused it when I've used it.
03:52:52 <Darius> I have been tweaking the code attempting for less space usage, I'm working on quantifying the difference now
04:04:33 <delYsid> Darius: The overflow happens if you play a game
04:04:43 <delYsid> and if you uncomment the rawmoves pattern for castling...
04:04:55 <delYsid> Igloo: doing that, but it isn't easy actually.
04:05:15 <Igloo> :-(
04:05:47 <Darius> It'd be nice if there was just an example you could run to cause the error... (something to feed to evaluate)
04:06:16 <delYsid> Darius: just uncomment that line and compile play.  after your first move, it overflows...
04:06:16 <Darius> By the way, isJust in Maybe, is probably better than maybe False (const True)
04:06:34 <Darius> ok
04:06:56 <Darius> (and not . isJust, for maybe True (const False))
04:10:32 <delYsid> tnx
04:10:34 <delYsid> fixed
04:11:41 <delYsid> White to move:
04:11:42 <delYsid> e2-e4
04:11:42 <delYsid> Stack space overflow: current size 1048576 bytes.
04:11:43 <delYsid> Use `+RTS -Ksize' to increase it.
04:12:02 <Igloo> Errr, not . isJust is isNothing  :-)
04:14:32 <Darius> well, that's even better
04:15:49 <delYsid> hmm, could it be that the where-clauses in castlemoves generate some garbage-uncollectable stuff?
04:15:55 <Darius> I get an access violation, not a stack overflow.  I'm recompiling to see if it's because of that
04:17:10 <Darius> no, I just seem to get an access violation if I enter an illegal move
04:17:24 <delYsid> yah, thats another bug...
04:17:37 <delYsid> just use sq-sq notation, that works for all kind of moves.
04:17:49 <delYsid> just try e2-e4
04:18:12 <Darius> How is it crashing?  I could imagine an exception.
04:21:43 <delYsid> Move.hs:200 -- That line needs uncommenting to show the effect...
04:22:02 <Darius> yah, it's uncommented
04:22:30 <Darius> well the using -xc (and as the heap profile suggests) kingincheck is the problem function (or near there)
04:25:29 <delYsid> -xc?
04:25:50 <Darius> <Move.applyMove',Move.applyMove,Move.tryMove,Move.moveDetailsFor,Eval.moves,Minimax.goodGameCutOff,Eval.bestMove,Main.play,Main.main>
04:26:02 <Darius> 4.16.3 of the GHC User Guide
04:26:40 <Darius> er hmm
04:27:00 <Darius> well it was kingincheck the ether time (or maybe I'm going crazy)
04:27:58 <Igloo> Is applyMove' pastable?
04:28:11 <Igloo> Oh, never mind, I have th eURL here
04:28:46 <Darius> btw, tabs are evil
04:28:54 <delYsid> applyMove' is just a pure piece mover.  applyMove knows about special moves like castling
04:29:20 <Igloo> Is   maybe p id mpp   ==    fmap p mpp?
04:29:50 <delYsid> @type fmap
04:29:51 <lambdabot> fmap :: Functor a => (b -> c) -> a b -> a c
04:30:04 <Igloo> del: Does that tell you what exception was raised?
04:30:14 <Darius> I wouldn't think so, it'd be Nothing => p, Just x => x
04:30:26 <Igloo> Ah, right
04:31:04 <delYsid> Igloo: It returns either the piece moving, or the piece the move promoted too...
04:31:19 <Igloo> Oh, I meant to ask Darius which exception
04:35:21 <Darius> -xc? It just lists the call stack I wrote above.  Otherwise, you get the same output, i.e. the stack overflow message
04:35:46 <delYsid> where do I specify -xc?
04:39:19 <Darius> If you've compiled for profiling you add +RTS -xc -RTS to the commandline when you execute the program
04:43:30 <Darius> you use a +1 pattern?  I don't think I've ever seen that except for in an old message on the Haskell mailinglist
04:45:33 <delYsid> yah, I've heard it is sort of depreached
04:45:49 <delYsid> hmm, and how do I compile with profiling? -prof doesnt work.
04:49:06 <Darius> it doesn't? in what way?  If you are getting an ungodly amount of linker errors that's because you need to add -prof (and probably not -auto-all) to the commandline for ALL the ghc invocations (look in the makefile)
04:54:54 <delYsid> if I use -prof, I get errors like "interface file for Maybe not found"...
04:55:45 <delYsid> aha, silly me I need to install ghc5-prof
04:59:36 <delYsid> hmm, now I compiled with -prof and use +RTS -xc, and I get the same error, with a <> at the beginning... hmm
05:00:37 <Darius> add -auto-all when you compile
05:00:59 <Darius> otherwise you have no cost-centres to get the info from
05:02:38 <delYsid> ok
05:02:53 <delYsid> now i have a call-stack, but it isnt very long and actually a very valid path
05:02:54 <delYsid> gah
05:11:22 <delYsid> is there a way to also see the arguments of those functions?
05:14:03 <Darius> HOOD or Hat.  The profiler can't help you there.
05:15:35 <delYsid> ohhhh!?
05:15:36 <delYsid>   mif = MoveInFull (c,k) sq m $ kingincheck (opponent c) bd2
05:15:37 <delYsid>   bd2 = applyMove mif bd
05:15:48 <delYsid> hmm, can anyone see a potential problem in this?
05:16:30 <delYsid> (not that bd2 needs mif which itself needs bd2
05:18:14 <Darius> yeah, I was just looking at that function (after tinkering with MoveDetailsFor; following the callstack)
05:18:49 <Darius> oh well, in EvalModule I had something like (s,env) <- define s env
05:22:00 <Darius> moveDetailsFor can be rewritten (in what I think is clearer, but which may or may not be more efficient or correct) as
05:22:00 <Darius> moveDetailsFor :: Colour -> Board -> [(MoveInFull,Board)]
05:22:19 <Darius> moveDetailsFor c bd = concatMap f $ forcesColoured c bd
05:22:20 <Darius>     where f ksq = catMaybes $ map (\rm -> tryMove c ksq rm bd) $ rawmoves c ksq bd
05:23:47 <delYsid> cute
05:58:40 <delYsid> hmm, could the usage of home in castlemoves be a problem?
05:59:30 <delYsid> It uses a variable from the argument list of castlemoves and is actually used to construct the Move data-type, which is embedded in the recursiv gameTree
06:03:06 <Darius> why do you say it's a problem?
06:04:28 * Igloo gets confused by SF
06:04:37 <Igloo> searchign for haskell-libs doesn't find it
06:07:15 <Darius> SF?
06:07:22 <Igloo> SourceForge
06:07:37 <Igloo> It's disasterously slow, too
06:08:22 <Igloo> Is there a chess tarball somewhere?
06:11:48 <delYsid> not yet
06:11:58 <delYsid> Igloo: http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/
06:12:23 <Igloo> Ta, checked out now
06:12:29 <Igloo> Works for me
06:12:38 <Igloo> White to move:
06:12:38 <Igloo> e2-e4
06:12:38 <Igloo> Black moves Nb8-a6
06:12:40 <Igloo> ...
06:12:42 <Igloo> White to move:
06:13:01 <Igloo> That's with recent CVS GHC
06:15:18 <Igloo> Oh, I forgot about the uncommenting
06:15:22 <basti_> hi all
06:15:49 <Igloo> Hi
06:16:22 <delYsid> hmm, I dont get this
06:17:55 * Igloo increases the stack and waits lots
06:18:08 <basti_> O(n^9)?
06:18:28 <delYsid> strange is that moveDetailsFor works fine on a Board which allows castling...
06:19:55 <delYsid> btw, is there any way to define a instance of show for a tupel of two specific types?
06:20:16 <delYsid> s/tupel/tuple/
06:20:33 <Igloo> No
06:20:40 <Igloo> You'd have to make your own datastructure
06:20:59 <basti_> how about extending show that it can handle tuples?
06:21:14 <delYsid> bah
06:21:18 <basti_> :)
06:21:19 <Igloo> How many times do you expect rawmoves to be called after "e2-e4", del?
06:21:49 <delYsid> instance MoveInFull m, Board b => (m,b) where
06:21:51 <delYsid> would be nice
06:22:35 <delYsid> Igloo: play uses a static depth of 4. so it should look two moves ahead.
06:23:09 <Igloo> Well it's being called more than 7000 times for the king
06:23:54 <Igloo> Oh, 2 moves for each player?
06:24:10 <basti_> no 2 half moves :)
06:24:17 <basti_> am i right?
06:24:26 <delYsid> Igloo: right
06:24:43 <Igloo> Is it OK to pass bestMove 1 instead of 4?
06:25:24 <delYsid> that is sort of useless :)
06:25:28 <Darius> kingincheck (according to the profiler) is alloc'ing 61% of the memory, which is pretty significant considering it uses 1.5 GB
06:25:36 <Igloo> Is it valid, though?
06:25:44 <Igloo> Hmmm, that calls it twice for the king
06:25:56 <Igloo> and works
06:26:59 <Igloo> Hang on, why is it giving me e2?
06:27:22 <Igloo> Oh, because I'm looking at kingmoves not castlemoves
06:28:56 <Igloo> Right, it's recursing
06:29:17 <Smerdyakov> Well, that's your problem, then. Just disable recursion.
06:30:24 <Igloo> Euch, yo ushouldn't export functions you don't need to, it makes debugging harder
06:33:37 <Darius> attacking can be rewritten nicely as a list comprehension
06:33:39 <delYsid> which one is the problem?
06:33:57 <delYsid> Darius: hmm?
06:37:38 <Darius> attacking c sq bd = [(k,ssq) | (MoveInFull (c,k) ssq (Move tsq _ _) _) <- legalMovesFor c bd, tsq == sq]
06:38:18 <delYsid> oh, sweet
06:38:43 <Darius> actually rename the c (I'm pretty sure)
06:39:01 <Darius> you want the outer c not the inner one
06:40:54 <Darius> Personally, I tend to avoid shadowing variables
06:41:35 <Darius> of course there are times...
06:41:42 <Darius> @get-definition showNum
06:41:42 <lambdabot> showNum = \n.(\showNum.if n < 0 then B reverse showNum (0-n) else B reverse showNum n) (Y (\showNum n.if n < 10 then [digitToChar n] else digitToChar (mod n 10) : showNum (n/10)))
06:41:49 <Igloo> del, I think I might know the board that is causing the problem if that will help you
06:42:36 <delYsid> Igloo: yah, that would be interesting
06:42:48 <Igloo> OK to message it to you?
06:54:39 <delYsid> hmmm
06:54:48 <delYsid> free [6,7]
06:54:56 <delYsid> could it be that laziness is somehow getting me there?
06:55:31 <Igloo> How do you mean?
06:56:16 <delYsid> Just thought some part of the list might not get evaled or something
06:58:34 <Igloo> If you have something that doesn't terminate you should be able to keep cutting it down to the part that doesn't terminate until the problem becomes obvious
06:59:12 <Igloo> e.g. if foo x y z isn't terminating then get the definition of foo and try all the bits until one of them doesn't terminate
07:00:17 <delYsid> hmm, I think the problem is that free uses attacking, which itself uses (opponent c)
07:00:22 <delYsid> hmm
07:01:17 <Igloo> Oh, and attacking looks at the legal moves?
07:01:47 <Igloo> Yes, that would loop
07:05:47 <Darius> yeah. legalMovesFor -> moveDetails -> rawMoves -> castleMoves -> attacking -> legalMovesFor
07:06:21 <Darius> which is fine as long as it doesn't get the same input
07:07:10 <Igloo> I'm not convinced, and I think it will break even without castlemoves
07:07:40 <Igloo> When seeing if black king can move you need to make sure it isn't attacked where it is moving to, which means you'd need to check if the white king can move there, right?
07:07:59 <Igloo> But if you use legalMovesFor for that it will in turn check if the black king can move there
07:08:02 <Igloo> And so on
07:08:31 <Darius> in short you need to keep track of whose been checked
07:09:15 <Igloo> Or generate moves ignoring moving into/across check and then filter out those illegal ones outside of that function
07:09:47 <Igloo> So legalMoves ... = filter not_into_across_check (lm ...) and lm recursively calls lm, not legalMoves
07:10:13 <delYsid> free :: Colour -> Board -> [Square] -> Bool
07:10:13 <delYsid> free c bd sqs = not $ any onSq sqs
07:10:13 <delYsid>   where
07:10:13 <delYsid>   onSq sq = (not (emptyAtAll bd (\sq' -> sq==sq'))) ||
07:10:14 <delYsid>              (not (null (attacking (opponent c) sq bd)))
07:10:29 <delYsid> this is the problem. call this with cBoard (latest cvs) and it hangs.
07:10:39 <delYsid> *Move> free White cBoard [Sq 6 1, Sq 7 1]
07:10:39 <delYsid> Interrupted.
07:11:04 <Igloo> Where cBoard is the board I gave you?
07:11:30 <Darius> Igloo: actually rawmove doesn't check 
07:11:41 <delYsid> Igloo: yes
07:11:43 <delYsid> cvs up
07:11:56 <Igloo> Oh, OK, I was hypothesising from the discussion  :-)
07:13:59 <delYsid> hmm, I think I need to rewrite attacking such that it doesn't care about calculating check announcements, since that info is not used anyway
07:15:23 * Igloo is confused - that doesn't seem to have the same type as the only free that I can see defined
07:16:18 <delYsid> Igloo: I just factored it out ...
07:16:34 <delYsid> it takes a list of squares, instead of a list of files now...
07:16:50 <Igloo> Ah, OK
07:18:01 <Igloo> Not in CVS then unless I am confused
07:18:41 <delYsid> lemme commit that
07:19:04 <Igloo> Well, you understand the code better anyway so will probably find it easire to fix than me
07:20:13 <delYsid> done
07:20:29 <delYsid> hm
07:20:32 * delYsid needs a break
07:21:38 <Igloo> Darius: Are you sure?
07:21:55 <delYsid> aha
07:22:02 <delYsid> hehe, I think I'm getting close now...
07:22:08 <Igloo> In fact I'm sure you contradicted the call sequence you described above
07:22:42 <delYsid> *Move> attacking Black (Sq 6 1) cBoard
07:22:42 <delYsid> Interrupted.
07:23:31 <delYsid> attacking looks at legalMovesFor (opponent c), which also includes the castling move of White, which itself needs to look at attacking ...
07:23:35 * Igloo still think that's the loop I described above
07:23:45 <Igloo> Right, yes
07:24:05 <Igloo> [15:08] < Igloo> So legalMoves ... = filter not_into_across_check (lm ...) and 
07:24:05 <Igloo>                  lm recursively calls lm, not legalMoves
07:24:39 <Igloo> Oh, and not_into_across_check will also call lm
07:25:44 <delYsid> hmm, I think I'll write attacking just like kingincheck is done...
07:25:55 <delYsid> this solve the problem...
07:26:18 <Igloo> Oh, if you have a kingincheck you can just call it for the king in each of the places it has to move through
07:27:14 <delYsid> that is what tryMove does.
07:27:26 <Igloo> So what's attacking for?
07:27:26 <delYsid> it applies a move, and looks if the king is in check.
07:27:54 <delYsid> Igloo: attacking should give a list of (Piece,Square) of opponent coloured pieces able to move to that square
07:27:56 <Igloo> Ah, right, so you can use that instead of attacking
07:28:21 <delYsid> i.e., the castling rule forbids castling if for instance opponent piece could move to f1
07:28:22 <Igloo> You'd be giving it moves that are themselves illegal, but that shouldn't matter
07:29:58 <delYsid> hmm, this is twisted
07:30:19 <delYsid> Only legal moves of the opponent are considered blocking a castle...
07:32:17 <Igloo> I don't see the problem - you already have kingincheck that doesn't call legalMoves
07:32:30 <norpan> chess indeed
07:32:41 <Igloo> All you need to do is to call that with the king in 3 or 4 different places
07:42:43 <delYsid> I think I solved it
07:43:05 <basti_> mph... im do still not fully understand monads :/
07:45:31 <Smerdyakov> basti_, a monad in general is just any instance of a certain type class signature. What do you not understand about that?
07:46:07 <basti_> I dont understand why they are implemented in haskell the way they are
07:46:31 <basti_> i understand the use and the general concept and why its neccesary (sp?) [or so i think]
07:46:39 <Darius> Smerdyakov: a monad in _general_ is an abstraction of an adjunction.  I think there is quite a bit one could not understand about that
07:47:42 <Smerdyakov> Darius, do you mean things not to understand about the definition, or about theorems you could try to prove about it?
07:47:55 <Darius> Can you be more specific on what you don't understand about it's implementation?
07:48:26 <Smerdyakov> basti_, monads are important in Haskell because they make order explicit in an environment where order is very hazy in general because of lazy evaluation.
07:48:41 <basti_> yes I see.
07:48:51 <Darius> Smerdyakov: I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but I'm pretty sure the answer is both.
07:49:03 <basti_> but when I look at implementation theres always some strange things
07:49:20 <basti_> in one example I saw a newtype X = X(\s->(s,a)) or something
07:49:28 <Smerdyakov> Darius, maybe you could explain a test for determining that someone "does not understand monads"?
07:49:53 <Smerdyakov> basti_, there's probably not a function abstraction in a type definition =)
07:49:59 <Darius> Simple: when they say "I don't understand monads".  This test is 99% accurate.
07:50:18 <Smerdyakov> Darius, but it leaves someone who wants to help this person without any way to help him.
07:50:23 <basti_> Darius i understand that monads are similar to monoids
07:50:39 <Smerdyakov> Darius, so it's a bad definition, IMO.
07:51:06 <basti_> that they implement some special functions that help "executing" things in order
07:51:08 <Darius> Definition? Which definition?
07:51:10 <Igloo> basti: That's a standard pattern - things of type X take an old state and return a value and a new state (or fail)
07:51:13 <basti_> and returning defined values
07:51:33 <basti_> Igloo yeah, but why do I need this newtype thingie? ;)
07:51:33 <Smerdyakov> Darius, in true theoretical CS manner, I am defining sets in terms of tests that recognize their members =)
07:51:55 <Igloo> Well, things of type X don't fail, but things of the Monad X can fail
07:52:09 <Igloo> basti: Because you need to say "instance Monad X where ..."
07:52:22 <basti_> ahh...
07:52:23 <Igloo> You could replace newtype by data if that would make you happier
07:52:24 * basti_ ponders
07:53:03 <basti_> type "s" is here the state, and type a is the result value?
07:53:04 <basti_> type
07:53:07 <basti_> not value
07:53:25 <Igloo> Yup
07:53:28 <basti_> okay
07:53:30 <basti_> next thing
07:53:47 <basti_> I see instance Monad (X a)
07:54:20 <basti_> that means, this is the Definition for a Monad over type X with functions that return values we dont know
07:54:21 <basti_> ?
07:54:44 <basti_> no with a state type we do not know.
07:54:51 <Smerdyakov> That means, for anything with type X a for some a, we have all the necessary operations to treat it like a monad member.
07:55:13 <Smerdyakov> ... and then you proceed to define those operations.
07:55:15 <basti_> okay.
07:55:31 <basti_> mmmh
07:56:14 <basti_> do I have to use a variable type?
07:56:18 <basti_> and if, why?
07:56:27 <Smerdyakov> No, you don't have to.
07:56:31 <basti_> okay.
07:56:40 <Smerdyakov> But if the type isn't used in a limiting why, why not make it generic?
07:56:54 <basti_> hmm.
07:57:05 <Smerdyakov> s/why/way
07:57:57 * basti_ tries
07:58:35 <Igloo> No, it has to be a type variable or you can't define return
07:58:45 <basti_> TSM a >>= k = TSM (k a)
07:58:52 <basti_> TSM is X here
07:58:59 <basti_> does this make any sense? ;)
07:59:03 <basti_> I suppose not.
07:59:38 <Darius> that's bind for the identity monad
08:00:01 <basti_> uuuuh.
08:00:03 <basti_> ermm.
08:00:11 <basti_> you mean it wont change anything with my state?
08:00:53 <Smerdyakov> Oops. =)
08:00:57 <basti_> ? ;)
08:01:13 * basti_ apologizes in advance if he might hurt your eyes
08:02:45 <Darius> it means (in do notation); do x <- (exp1); y <- (exp2); return (f x y) is the same as f (exp1) (exp2)
08:03:23 <basti_> mmmh
08:03:27 <basti_> I think I understand
08:03:40 <Darius> At first, it's probably easier to start with the monad free solution and see what commonalities you can abstract out
08:04:00 * basti_ nods
08:05:11 <Darius> E.g. you can start with a bunch of partial functions and you are constantly writing the same code to check them; you abstract out that repeated code; and now you have most of the exception monad
08:06:02 * basti_ wonders about what kind of brain first came up with this stuff ;)
08:13:50 <Marvin--> monads? it comes from category theory, doesn't it?
08:14:50 <basti_> yeah i read that
08:16:46 <esap> Monads are one of the basic building blocks of category theory. [Along with adjunctions, products, limits, duality, etc.]
08:17:26 <Smerdyakov> And don't forget categories!
08:17:37 <esap> heheh :-)
08:17:47 <esap> too obvious to mention...
08:17:53 <Smerdyakov> Anyone ever had butter beans?
08:18:05 <Darius> yes...?
08:18:49 <Smerdyakov> OK! I've never heard of them before, and now I am about to eat some.
08:19:04 <Darius> black-eyed peas are nasty
08:20:07 * Darius says, apropos to almost nothing.
08:21:44 <Smerdyakov> Well, I've gotten black-eyed peas from the same food truck before. =)
08:24:57 <Darius> Igloo: Did shapr ever get you that program for the hypothetical RTS?
08:25:46 <Igloo> Yeah, only he had the same problems with combinators that I was seeing (which is why I asked him for it  :-)  )
08:26:09 <Igloo> I'm currently liking a FSM based GUI which is ultimately defining a function for each state
08:26:16 <Igloo> Are you interested in the discussion?
08:26:36 <Darius> Some, yeah.
08:26:44 <Igloo> Oh, does anyone happen to know who was doing what with SDL around here?
08:26:55 <Igloo> What's your e-mail address?
08:27:05 <Darius> ddarius86@hotmail.com
08:28:16 <Darius> Someone mentioned it (SDL) and I think a Haskell binding for it.  I've only used SDL in C++.
08:28:45 <Igloo> Oh, you've used it? I spot a potential UI man  :-)
08:29:28 <Marvin--> SDL is nice
08:29:47 <Igloo> s/UI man/UI team/  :-)
08:29:50 <Marvin--> PyGame is *very* nice :-)
08:30:11 <Marvin--> I wouldn't use SDL for generic GUIs though
08:30:17 <Marvin--> what's FSM?
08:30:23 <Igloo> s/UI team/UI man/ # Py?!? You're outta your mind!  :-P
08:30:28 <Igloo> Finite State Machine
08:30:36 <Marvin--> ah
08:30:42 <Igloo> Generic GUIs? This is a game GUI
08:30:53 <Marvin--> ah, okay, then SDL is good :)
08:31:03 <Igloo> OK, you're back on the team  :-)
08:31:19 <Igloo> (what do you mean you don't want to be!)
08:31:19 <Marvin--> pygame is a python wrapper for sdl but also adds handy python classes for working with sprites and stuff
08:31:37 <Igloo> Would a Haskell port of it make sense?
08:32:49 * esap thinks FSMs should only be used for describing interfaces.
08:33:08 <Marvin--> I don't know
08:33:08 <Igloo> Do you want to be CCed, Marvin?
08:33:18 <Marvin--> not really :)
08:33:19 <Igloo> As opposed to what, esap?
08:33:23 <Igloo> OK  :-)
08:33:41 <esap> igloo: as opposed to describing implementation (like GUIs).
08:34:34 <Igloo> Ah, I think you misunderstand - the GUI would be a picture of circles and arrows that make a FSM
08:35:10 <esap> oh.
08:35:51 <esap> I've seen people use FSMs to describe GUI frameworks.
09:20:37 * Igloo bounces
09:25:49 * esap cobounces.
09:28:10 <o3> what have you all done with the real shapr?
09:28:42 <Igloo> We chopped him up and took a piece each
09:34:49 <o3> harsh
09:35:36 <basti_> I think I understand now what Darius meant with unity monad
09:42:48 <Darius> why are my mailinglist replies not threading right?
09:43:23 <Igloo> Which list/thread?
09:43:44 <Darius> Haskell and Haskell-cafe
09:44:51 <Igloo> You aren't producing In-Reply-To: or References: headers
09:45:01 <Igloo> Are you using OE?
09:46:09 <Darius> No, hotmail
09:46:52 <Igloo> Oh. I can't think of anything more useful to say than "Don't Do That Then"
09:47:09 <Darius> It seemed to work for the TH list
09:47:20 <Igloo> Strange
09:48:14 <Igloo> No, looks broken there too
09:48:30 <Igloo> Oh, you're him!
09:49:42 <Darius> Yes, I'm me.  And, you're right.
09:49:45 <Darius> *sigh*
09:51:07 <Darius> What's the format of the In-Reply-To: header?
09:53:16 <Igloo> In-Reply-To: <msgid> if what you are replying to has Message-Id: <msgid>
09:57:18 <Marvin--> someone please for the love of god tell micros~1 this
10:00:11 <Darius> Since (surely for my own protection) I can't view the message headers, I can't get the message-id and my crackheaded scheme probably wouldn't have worked anyways
10:23:23 <Darius> Gah!
10:30:06 <Darius> Those GP people.
10:35:35 <Darius> Hmm, now I need a mail client.
10:36:36 <basti_> hmm
10:38:15 <basti_> Ive got a Type "data Foo = Bla Integer | Blub String String", how can I check if a variable is a "Bla ..."
10:38:16 <basti_> ?
10:38:35 <Darius> case analysis
10:38:45 <basti_> let me look it up
10:38:48 <Riastradh> case foo of
10:38:56 <Riastradh>    Blah int -> ...
10:39:05 <Riastradh>    Blub s1 s2 -> ...
10:39:09 <basti_> i see... only case is capable of doing this?
10:39:11 <Darius> if you are going to do this a lot, you may want to define isBla.  isBla (Bla i) = True;isBla _ = False
10:39:30 <Darius> Pattern matching is case in disguise so yes
10:39:37 <basti_> ic ;)
10:40:05 <Darius> but (as isBla illustrates) you can simply write a function to do this (there are also record constructors)
10:40:55 <basti_> *nods*
10:40:59 <basti_> I think it works
10:41:19 <Darius> a common pattern is data Foo = Foo Int; unFoo (Foo x) = x.  For single data constructors and newtypes this is often shortened to newtype Foo = Foo { unFoo :: Int }
10:42:07 <Igloo> Or newtype Foo = mkFoo { unFoo :: Int }
10:43:13 * basti_ tries to put it into his Memory ;)
10:43:24 <basti_> whatever it might be useful for ;)
10:43:56 <basti_> i think its working now :)
10:46:02 <basti_> yow :)
10:46:17 <basti_> I think now im about to master monads :)
10:49:00 <basti_> a very bizarre solution for terminal io but i will work I hope ;)
10:49:54 <Darius> monads?
10:50:11 <basti_> yeah this was a subproblem of my monad stuff ;)
10:52:56 <hdaume> why can't i pattern match on % (Ratio)?  'foo (a%b) = undefined' gives a pattern error
10:53:59 <ibid> % is not a constructor
10:54:09 <ibid> it is a function operator
10:54:35 <ibid> as i recall, the rational constructor is not exported
10:55:55 <hdaume> that's obnoxious :)
10:55:59 <ibid> it makes sense
10:56:26 <ibid> should x :% 3 match also 2 :% 6?
10:56:39 <ibid> if so, how would this be accomplished?
10:56:49 <ibid> if not, why?
10:57:11 * basti_ has a hard time to follow
10:57:18 <hdaume> yeah, i know.
10:57:35 <ibid> basti_: ask and you shall be answered... perhaps ;-)
10:58:04 <basti_> well I can roughly follow the course so i rather decided not to disturb ;)
11:08:41 <basti_> mmmh
11:09:27 <basti_> does a ">>=" function have to return a value (as in the Monad sense \s->(s,a))?
11:09:41 <basti_> I worked around with returning ()
11:09:51 <Igloo> That's common
11:09:58 <ibid> a >>= function?
11:10:00 <Igloo> e.g. putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
11:10:04 <basti_> Ic
11:10:33 <Marvin--> wow, haskell records are even cooler than I thought
11:10:48 <Darius> ?
11:11:03 <Marvin--> I just realized that you can have the same selector for different constructors as long as they have the same type
11:11:23 <Igloo> Yeah, that can be very handy
11:11:26 <kosmikus> :q
11:11:28 <Marvin--> that's so cool
11:11:34 <kosmikus> sorry ;)
11:16:16 <basti_> :)
11:17:31 <basti_> WOAH
11:17:31 <basti_> my monad is working :)
11:30:47 <Igloo> Grrr, head look broken again
11:33:05 <Igloo> Hmmm, I think if the autobuilder confirms that before I go to bed I'll have commit anyway
11:36:24 <Igloo> Heh, it's still run by v-julsew
11:37:09 <Marvin--> huh?
11:37:19 <Igloo> Huh to what?
11:37:35 <Marvin--> what are you talking about
11:37:58 <Igloo> Oh, GHC is autobuilt once a day and the output sent to cvs-ghc@haskell.org
11:38:01 <Marvin--> ah
12:23:46 <Vincenz> hi
12:24:59 <Igloo> Hey ho
12:44:18 <shapr> y0 y0
12:44:21 <shapr> what's up?
12:45:00 <Igloo> Lots of stuff
12:45:05 <shapr> really?
12:45:06 <shapr> like what?
12:45:42 <Igloo> Well, mainly waiting for various e-mails ATM  :-(
12:45:53 <shapr> interesting e-mails?
12:46:52 <Igloo> An automated e-mail to check the GHC HEAD doesn't build, a couple of mails from my supervisor and an e-mail from shapr that I'm reading now  :-)
12:47:20 <shapr> yay!
12:47:37 <shapr> mail from me is always entertaining.
12:49:40 <andersca> hi shapr
12:56:59 <shapr> y0 andersca 
12:57:00 <shapr> wassup?
12:57:02 <shapr> how's the kb?
13:04:39 <andersca> getting more
13:04:42 <andersca> and more used to it
13:04:51 <andersca> only problem is that I mistake enter for space some times
13:09:20 <shapr> andersca: do you like it so far?
13:11:08 <andersca> shapr: definatly
13:11:22 <Riastradh> Defin_I_tely.
13:11:52 <Riastradh> And you forgot the 'e,' too, but it's the 'a' for an 'i' that really bugs me.
13:13:36 <andersca> I blame the keyboard
13:15:23 * shapr laughs
13:15:55 <shapr> Igloo: hey, any name for this spiffy game?
13:16:07 <shapr> Igloo: I thought of AI Wars, or maybe ShadowBoxing
13:17:17 <Igloo> None at all, but don't forget we haven't got a game yet  :-)
13:18:44 <basti_> hey shapr btw... my terminal monad is basically working now
13:21:08 <shapr> hi gabriel 
13:21:13 <gabriel> hihi
13:21:14 <shapr> basti_: cool! is it online?
13:21:32 <basti_> hmm ill comment it first and insert the right control strings
13:21:38 * gabriel is copiling hugs for a presentation that syntaxpolice is doing....
13:21:39 <shapr> gabriel: are you part of the Columbus Cabal?
13:21:41 * gabriel is wondering how you quit hugs
13:21:43 <gabriel> yep
13:21:45 <Igloo> :q
13:21:47 <shapr> gabriel: try :q
13:21:49 <gabriel> i dont code haskell though, not yet at least
13:21:50 <gabriel> kk thanks
13:21:54 <Igloo> Or ^D
13:21:56 <gabriel> im more of a prolog person myself
13:21:57 <basti_> gabriel ctrl-d works in most environments
13:22:10 <basti_> prolog is coll too!
13:22:11 <basti_> cool
13:22:20 <gabriel> k, cause like in lisp i do (quit) obviously
13:22:21 <basti_> especially for logic-riddle type problems
13:22:24 <gabriel> i dunno
13:22:57 <basti_> I think prolog is a very elegant concept
13:22:59 <shapr> I've never learned Prolog.
13:23:05 <shapr> it's next on my list of things to learn.
13:23:07 <basti_> especially for highly structured data
13:23:13 <shapr> After I'm fluent with Haskell...
13:23:14 <gabriel> yeah
13:23:20 <gabriel> lotr's ai stuff was all done in prolog
13:23:43 <basti_> its basically like coding everything with truth values
13:23:45 <basti_> ;)
13:23:50 <gabriel> yes
13:23:59 <gabriel> im by trade a c/c++ coder
13:24:06 <gabriel> so learning lisp and prolog has really made me think differently
13:24:07 <basti_> one exciting thing is that you can do backwards variable replacement of some sort ;)
13:24:12 <shapr> I'm a Python/Java coder by pay.
13:24:15 <gabriel> i go about problems in a lot better fashion
13:24:17 <basti_> ive experienced the same
13:24:30 <gabriel> i dont like java ta all
13:24:32 <gabriel> i love python though
13:24:37 <shapr> I totally agree with you there.
13:24:40 <shapr> @fact java
13:24:41 <lambdabot> Java is the COBOL of the future --Shae Erisson
13:24:47 <gabriel> its probably the best general purpose oop language in the past few years to mature
13:24:56 <gabriel> even c# is a lot better then java
13:24:59 <basti_> java is a nice design for a imperative oop language
13:25:01 <gabriel> i hate to say it, but microsoft did it the right way
13:25:08 <gabriel> they standardized their language already, etc.
13:25:22 <basti_> never did c#
13:25:31 <shapr> hopefully I never will do c#
13:25:34 <shapr> D Flat language
13:25:36 <gabriel> sun hasnt even had standards done by iso or anything or ansi 
13:25:47 <basti_> *shrugs*
13:25:48 <gabriel> shapr: c# is quite elegant as well
13:25:49 <basti_> java is alive
13:25:53 <gabriel> i dont like microsoft
13:25:57 <gabriel> but c# is amazing :)
13:25:57 <shapr> gabriel: we'll see if Microsoft screws over mono or dot.gnu
13:26:06 <gabriel> yeah true
13:26:10 <gabriel> i dont think they will
13:26:13 <shapr> I don't trust 'em
13:26:14 <gabriel> it's in their best interests not to :)_
13:26:24 <gabriel> the more people coding in c#, regardless of the platform
13:26:33 <gabriel> the better they can entice them with good developer tools to msoft platforms
13:26:51 <gabriel> i finally found a platform i like developing on more then gnu emacs
13:27:00 <gabriel> an ide rather
13:27:09 <shapr> scary thought.
13:27:14 <gabriel> anyone tried project builder by apple?
13:27:14 <basti_> I think we need about two types of platforms:
13:27:20 <basti_> typed lambda and untyped lambda
13:27:21 <basti_> ;)
13:27:30 <gabriel> it emulates most of what emacs does, has amazing organization, better cvs integration (graphical obviously)
13:27:42 <gabriel> its just a very streamlined no bs ide
13:27:54 <basti_> never seen it...
13:28:06 <gabriel> its very nice
13:28:09 <Riastradh> ProjectBuilder is pretty decent, but it's Mac-specific, it's designed to work only with Carbon and Cocoa, and it isn't extensible like Emacs.
13:28:11 <gabriel> they took a lot of ideas from emacs
13:28:15 <gabriel> Riastradh: true
13:28:16 <basti_> i think dr scheme is a very nice environment, feture wise
13:28:16 <shapr> gabriel: can you fix it when it breaks? or do you have to wait for a vendor to fix it? ;-)
13:28:25 <gabriel> Riastradh: you dont *need* to do carbon or cocoa in it though
13:28:29 * gabriel has done lisp, python, perl, etc.
13:28:30 <basti_> you can have it mark variable matches...
13:28:43 <gabriel> in pb that is
13:28:51 <Riastradh> DrScheme would be great if it were faster and it looked more like a real native OS X app on OS X.
13:28:57 <gabriel> you can edit the tabs and indents and the way certain files react and are formatted
13:29:05 <gabriel> so i mean, i can change the compiler
13:29:16 <gabriel> so i can use python or a perl interpreter
13:29:18 <gabriel> on build 
13:29:28 * basti_ 's career went like: c64 basic, assembler, pc compiled basic, c++, prolog, haskell
13:29:36 <basti_> *g*
13:29:43 <shapr> I wrote an xmms-shell wrapper for emacs.
13:29:52 <basti_> wooh.
13:29:53 <gabriel> nice
13:29:53 <basti_> :)
13:29:56 <basti_> cool thing
13:30:18 <shapr> I just don't trust closed source apps.
13:30:34 <basti_> ;)
13:30:38 <Riastradh> Emacs has a built-in psychoanalyze-pinhead.  ProjectBuilder doesn't have anything -anywhere- close to that.
13:30:49 <gabriel> i think i went tibasic -> pascal -> assembler -> c -> c++ -> java (ditched java like a bad basic language) -> python -> prolog -> lisp -> and im going to try haskell
13:31:02 <basti_> oh yes java was inbetween too ;)
13:31:03 <shapr> yah, emacs has yow
13:31:06 <shapr> @yow
13:31:06 <lambdabot> Toes, knees, NIPPLES.  Toes, knees, nipples, KNUCKLES...
13:31:06 <lambdabot>  Nipples, dimples, knuckles, NICKLES, wrinkles, pimples!!
13:31:06 <lambdabot>  I don't like FRANK SINATRA or his CHILDREN.
13:31:08 <basti_> i dont consider that a language ;)
13:31:44 <gabriel> oh and throw in matlab in there out of college neccessity
13:31:54 * Riastradh went:  Scheme -> Perl -> Scheme -> C -> Scheme -> Objective-C -> Scheme -> Common Lisp -> Scheme -> OCaml -> Scheme -> Haskell -> Scheme/Haskell, with spatterings of Python, Ruby, and a couple other languages like that in between.
13:31:55 <gabriel> matlab is like ticalculators meet c
13:31:56 <gabriel> heh
13:32:02 <basti_> i just tried this a few times
13:32:07 <basti_> latex for fun is cool too ;)
13:32:11 <gabriel> yeah
13:32:16 <gabriel> i like texmacs though
13:32:17 <gabriel> saves me time
13:32:36 <gabriel> cause i can get the general layout and all done and then tweak it 
13:32:51 <mgoetze> Riastradh: hm, there seems to be a recurring theme, i haven't quite figured out what it is though... ;)
13:33:10 <gabriel> but yeah, i love opensource stuff as well
13:33:15 <basti_> ;)
13:33:17 * gabriel is vp of the opensource club @ osu
13:33:21 <gabriel> which isaac (syntaxpolice
13:33:23 <gabriel> ) started
13:33:29 <shapr> I did basic on a Sinclair something (Spectrum? ZX?), basic on a C=64, basic on IBM ROMs, assembler on an 8086, bit of C, Java, Visual Basic, SQL, Python, and now Haskell.
13:33:31 <basti_> osu?
13:33:32 <shapr> and elisp in there somewhere.
13:33:36 <basti_> oregon state university?
13:33:39 <gabriel> ohio state
13:33:47 <basti_> oic
13:34:07 <basti_> sql is a cool thing too
13:34:20 <shapr> I think it's time I followed SyntaxPolice's good example and started an open source club here
13:34:21 <gabriel> i think i was too young to do assembly on ibm on *real* 8086 machines, not the 286 and up ones..im talkin XT's
13:34:21 <gabriel> heh
13:34:27 <basti_> mmh i think ive got to do the dishes...
13:34:33 <basti_> ic ;)
13:34:44 <shapr> I bought myself an 8086 with my college money.
13:34:50 <gabriel> hahahha
13:34:52 <gabriel> how old are ya?
13:34:56 <shapr> older than you :-P

13:35:06 <lambdabot> shapr has a karma of 0
13:35:08 <gabriel> ahh, by 10 years no less
13:35:13 <shapr> Riastradh: the language is easy to learn, imho
13:35:25 <Riastradh> Ack, I'm reminded that I need to get the karma module working with writing to a file.
13:35:28 <Riastradh> shapr - ??

13:37:13 <Riastradh> 'Fact'-based?
13:37:16 <shapr> Riastradh: which I still haven't converted :-/
13:37:19 <gabriel> like prolog
13:37:22 <gabriel> you have 'facts'
13:37:31 <shapr> I don't think so.
13:37:32 <Riastradh> shapr - ?
13:37:36 <shapr> Riastradh: to a flat file
13:37:38 <Riastradh> Haskell is function-based.
13:37:44 <Darius> It's functional not logical
13:37:56 <gabriel> ah
13:38:03 <gabriel> prolog is logical, lisp is well lisp :)
13:38:13 <shapr> lithp
13:38:13 <Darius> Though if you like Haskell and logic programming then you may want to check out Curry
13:38:14 <shapr> whee
13:38:19 <shapr> whee: you still alive?
13:38:20 <Riastradh> shapr - http://www.bloodandcoffee.net/campbell/code/(Fact|Karma)Module.hs
13:38:40 <Riastradh> Fix what I've got so far.
13:38:49 <shapr> Riastradh: sure, in my copious free time ;-)
13:39:07 <Riastradh> shapr - Well, I'm too busy monadifying Scheme right now.
13:39:10 <gabriel> brb
13:39:22 <shapr> Riastradh: bah, finish what you start!
13:39:37 <Riastradh> shapr - OK, I'll finish monadifying Scheme!
13:39:37 <shapr> Riastradh: ok, I'll fix your version of Fact next chance I get
13:40:11 <Riastradh> ...and the KarmaModule.  They're really almost identical -- it's just that one uses finite maps of strings to strings and the other strings to integers.
13:40:22 <shapr> neat, #haskell now has fifty clients attached to it, (though two are 'bots)
13:40:24 * Igloo commits. Bah.
13:40:56 * Riastradh hrmphs, as #scheme has only a little more than half that many.
13:41:42 <gabriel> i should learn scheme sometime
13:41:44 <shapr> I dunno what makes some channels successful.
13:41:58 <shapr> lots of talking?
13:42:12 <Riastradh> gabriel - Read TYSFD -- http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/ -> Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days
13:42:32 <Riastradh> I guess Schemers prefer Usenet and mailing lists to IRC.
13:54:53 <basti_> re
14:06:52 <andersca> shapr: so I have accommodation for icfp in august...
14:10:59 <SyntaxPolice> hi gabriel
14:11:10 <gabriel> hey isaac
14:11:23 <gabriel> hugs wont compile correctly on solaris, at least the way that hte dept. has it setup
14:11:30 <SyntaxPolice> :(
14:11:37 <gabriel> SyntaxPolice: ask hurley to apt it to freedom
14:11:38 <gabriel> and use freedom
14:11:47 <gabriel> it may be *on* freedom
14:11:48 <gabriel> lemme chcek
14:11:51 <gabriel> check rather
14:11:53 <SyntaxPolice> it is on freedom already :)
14:12:04 <gabriel> just use freedom, i realize people will want to use stdsun
14:12:21 <gabriel> but, if i know them and all ill get hurley to give me root soon and i or he will make developer accounts
14:12:55 <gabriel> i've wanted to setup seperate machines for development as well though also, so maybe we can work on that
14:13:04 * gabriel is taking his dual 733 into dl 190 today for a development box
14:13:06 <SyntaxPolice> I see.
14:13:56 <gabriel> basically i want to set a rule system for freedom accounts, basically its like an honor system, get to know you type of deal
14:14:07 <gabriel> like maybe 4 meetings or events and irc chat for a month and you can get an account
14:14:23 <gabriel> just so we feel comfortable about who we give them too, cause right now we're not utilizing our resources as much as we should
14:36:53 <shapr> andersca: cool, I need to find accommodation also.
14:46:58 <Marvin--> you guys are looking for accommodation already?
14:47:01 <Marvin--> damn
14:47:35 <shapr> Marvin--: you can take the train, can't you?
14:47:50 <shapr> two hours train between U and G?
14:47:58 <andersca> I still haven't got accommodation for GUADEC
14:48:04 <andersca> and I'm giving a talk there
14:48:10 <Marvin--> eh, it's a bit more than that
14:48:11 <shapr> cool!
14:48:42 <shapr> maybe we could do a #haskell group and get bulk discounts ;-)
14:48:55 <Marvin--> I think it takes something between four and five hours with train from Gbg to U-sala
14:49:06 <shapr> oh
14:49:42 <andersca> 4.38
14:49:54 <Marvin--> or 4.08 depending on trains...
14:50:01 <Marvin--> 5.37 if you're unlucky
14:50:09 <shapr> hrm
14:50:27 <shapr> I wonder how long to take a train from here to Uppsala
14:50:29 <Marvin--> I have to start looking for accommodation in Oslo too
14:50:43 <shapr> or whether I should fly to Stockholm and take a train to Uppsala
14:50:47 <Marvin--> Boden - Uppsala?
14:50:49 <andersca> why are you going to oslo?
14:50:49 <shapr> yah
14:50:56 <Marvin--> andersca: debconf
14:51:01 <andersca> ah
14:51:04 <andersca> http://www.guadec.org/schedule/
14:51:06 <shapr> Marvin--: you have a train timetable in front of you?
14:51:07 <andersca> guadec is gonna ROCK
14:52:02 <Marvin--> shapr: I've got sj.se :) 12 hours or something with just busses and trains... though I think you'll want a Tågkompaniet train from Boden to Stockholm (night trains) and then train from Stockholm to Uppsala
14:52:08 <Marvin--> or just fly to Stockholm instead
14:52:12 <Marvin--> dunno about prices
14:52:30 <shapr> 12 hours isn't too bad.
14:53:04 <Marvin--> but that's mainly busses... I don't know about the Tågkompaniet trains
14:53:06 <shapr> andersca: nice talk title.
14:53:20 <andersca> shapr: it _had_ to be a pun
14:53:39 <shapr> I don't mind taking busses if I don't have to change vehicles often
14:53:41 <Marvin--> damn capitalism, it was much simpler when there was just one train company :/
14:53:45 <andersca> Gnumeric - Why Do We Bother?
14:53:47 <andersca> is a good title
14:53:58 <Marvin--> shapr: two changes, I think
14:54:06 <shapr> jdahlin is giving a Python talk, cool
14:54:21 <shapr> andersca: when do we get a DBUS-Haskell binding? :-)
14:54:22 <Marvin--> Boden - Luleå, Luleå - Sundsvall, Sundsvall - Uppsala
14:54:32 <shapr> oh, that's pretty good
14:54:49 <andersca> shapr: might do it for funkylus
14:54:59 <andersca> or funkilus
14:55:23 <shapr> google doesn't find that word
14:55:30 <Marvin--> shapr: heck, you can check Tågkompaniet yourself ;)  http://www.tagkompaniet.se/engelska/index.htm
14:55:30 <shapr> related to homunculus?
14:55:45 <shapr> or I could try my svenska...
14:55:55 <shapr> and probably end up in Murmansk...
14:55:59 <Marvin--> haha
14:56:36 <andersca> shapr: it's the multithreaded gtk filemanager that I'm gonna write for my afp course
14:56:41 <shapr> oh, nifty!
14:57:12 <shapr> what's the name from?
14:57:30 <andersca> nautilus, the gnome file manager
14:57:36 <andersca> and functional programmiung
14:59:03 <shapr> oh, I se
14:59:03 <shapr> e
14:59:17 <shapr> you didn't want to go for nautifunk? :-)
14:59:26 <shapr> admittedly, that's way too suggestive.
14:59:38 <Marvin--> "we put the funk in nautilus"? :)
14:59:48 * shapr laughs
15:00:07 <shapr> since most rap music nowadays seems to use funk for fuck
15:00:18 <Marvin--> sigh
15:00:29 <Marvin--> they should use fsck ;)
15:00:33 <shapr> yah, really
15:00:47 <shapr> nautifunk == naughty fsck
15:00:48 <shapr> hmm
15:01:42 <Marvin--> yay
15:01:45 <shapr> ?
15:01:55 <Marvin--> naughty fuck
15:02:00 <Marvin--> I mean, who doesn't want that? :)
15:02:15 <shapr> good question
15:03:10 <shapr> code is second only to women in my list of priorities.
15:03:15 <shapr> well, woman
15:03:23 <basti_> *g*
15:03:24 <Marvin--> heh
15:06:52 <Marvin--> ooh
15:06:56 * Marvin-- turns up the volume
15:07:02 <Marvin--> (Nightfall in Middle-Earth)
15:07:35 * Riastradh turns up the volume to Beethoven's Seventh.
15:08:20 <Marvin--> I have way too little classical music here
15:08:40 * Riastradh too.
15:09:21 <Riastradh> Only three Beethoven symphonies, two Mozart symphonies, and the music from the movie 'Amadeus.'
15:10:31 <Marvin--> I think the closest thing to classical music I have here is Johan de Meij, when I lived at my parents' place I used to borrow my dad's and my brother's classical music
15:10:33 <Marvin--> :)
15:10:46 <delYsid> hmm, how do I do a floating division on two integers?
15:11:41 <Marvin--> fromInteger
15:14:10 <delYsid> hmm
15:14:22 <delYsid>         Expected type: Integer
15:14:24 <delYsid>         Inferred type: Int
15:14:25 <delYsid> er
15:15:00 <Riastradh> fromInteger . fromInt
15:15:25 <Riastradh> Or even without the frominteger.
15:15:52 <delYsid>     Variable not in scope: `fromInt'
15:16:14 <Riastradh> Hmm.
15:16:21 <Riastradh> Have you imported Prelude?
15:16:31 <delYsid> not explicitly
15:16:38 <shapr> shouldn't need to
15:17:49 <delYsid> I just want to do (max a b) / (a+(negate b)) where a and b are ints...
15:18:26 <delYsid> er, the other way round
15:18:35 <shapr> ?
15:18:53 <delYsid> (a+(negate b)) / (max a b)
15:19:09 * Marvin-- goes to proofread some roleplaying stuff
15:19:28 <Marvin--> you can use fromInteger . toInteger  even though it's something of a hack
15:20:29 <shapr> that still doesn't fix it...
15:21:16 <shapr> a :: Int ;a = 5
15:21:16 <shapr> b :: Int ; b = 6
15:21:16 <shapr> foo = let aa = fromInteger a ; bb = fromInteger b in (a+(negate b)) / (max a b)
15:21:29 <shapr> No instance for (Fractional Int)
15:21:53 <shapr> delYsid: you could use div
15:22:06 <Riastradh> He needs floating point division, though.
15:22:10 <Marvin--> fromInteger (toInteger (5::Int)) / fromInteger (toInteger (7::Int))
15:22:11 <shapr> right
15:23:33 <shapr> ah
15:29:35 <tmoertel> fromIntegral (5::Int) / fromIntegral (7::Int)
15:31:00 <shapr> hi tmoertel 
15:31:01 <shapr> wassup?
15:31:32 <tmoertel> not too much; just about to walk the dog, actually
15:32:18 * tmoertel goes to walk his dog
15:37:53 <delYsid> wow
15:38:17 <delYsid> this simple addition to Eval.hs just persuaded it to open e2-e4 e7-e5 :)
15:38:20 <delYsid> hehehe
15:45:58 <Igloo> That's slightly better than the na6 it was doing before  :-)
15:51:40 <^self> hi.  
15:51:42 <shapr> y0
15:51:44 <^self> woah, lots of people.
15:51:46 <shapr> where?
15:51:46 <shapr> oh
15:52:02 <shapr> ^self: this is the curried chicken irc channel.
15:52:20 <Riastradh> No, CHICKEN is a Scheme implementation.
15:52:23 <shapr> whoops
15:52:31 <Riastradh> This is the curried helium channel.
15:52:36 <shapr> I'm convinced combinators should be called 'chickens'
15:52:39 <^self> i saw the "ad" for this channel in your lambdabot posting.
15:52:44 <shapr> then we can talk about curried chickens.
15:52:56 <shapr> ^self: yay! we shall advertise more!
15:53:00 <^self> heh.
15:53:33 <Riastradh> lambdabot posting?
15:53:34 <shapr> ^self: learning Haskell? or looking for other users?
15:53:40 <^self> unfortunately, i think you people will be first against the wall when the revolution comes.  SML FOREVER!!!!11  ALL HAIL NEW JERSEY!
15:53:44 <shapr> @yow
15:53:44 <lambdabot> This ASIAGO-N-DRIED TOMATO combo would taste a lot better between two
15:53:44 <lambdabot>  plastic SIPPER LIDS!
15:53:49 * Riastradh stabs fn.
15:53:50 <^self> heh.
15:53:58 <Riastradh> Er, ^self.  Whatever his nick is.
15:54:04 <shapr> ^self: maybe you're looking for #sml ?
15:54:12 <^self> Riastradh knows me too well.
15:54:17 <Riastradh> Indeed.
15:54:23 <shapr> they have the whips and chains, er I mean, strict community, over there...
15:54:38 * shapr looks strictly at Smerdyakov 
15:54:47 <Riastradh> Out of all the programming language communities I've witnessed so far, I like those of Haskell and Scheme most.
15:54:49 <^self> actually, i came here to idle, thinking it would maybe be a small channel with low traffic.
15:54:59 <shapr> ^self: hah! 
15:55:06 <^self> yes, i am mistaken.
15:55:20 <shapr> we talk so much some people have to leave irc to get any work done
15:55:23 * shapr looks pointedly at himself
15:55:26 <^self> i know that feeling.
15:55:30 <Riastradh> #scheme was too much for him.  #haskell will make him utterly explorb.
15:55:35 <shapr> yay! explorb!
15:55:46 * shapr boings
15:55:51 * Riastradh implorbs just for good measure.
15:56:12 <^self> it's been a long time since i played with haskell, though i still have a feb 2000 hugs on my box.
15:56:39 <shapr> We like Haskell.
15:56:41 * basti_ has too... is that a bad thing? ;)
15:56:46 <shapr> ^self: you must now write a lambdabot plugin.
15:56:48 <shapr> face the peril!
15:56:53 <^self> anyway, i will perhaps return later.  now, i crash!  night.
15:56:56 <shapr> er, wait, that's a #python joke.
15:57:07 <shapr> g'nite
15:57:22 <shapr> dang, we're back to 49
15:57:38 <basti_> ?
15:57:38 <^self> i wrote a dumb irc bot in python the other day, though i used neale of starship's irc package
15:57:43 <^self> (which, btw, was buggy)
15:57:57 <shapr> basti_: 48 users on #haskell
15:58:01 <shapr> I think I'm lagging
15:58:01 <basti_> oh i see
15:58:02 <shapr> or something
15:58:07 <basti_> no ive got 48 too
15:58:13 <Riastradh> No, shapr.
15:58:21 <shapr> ok
15:58:22 <shapr> whew
15:58:40 <shapr> it's time for CODE!
16:01:52 <shapr> Riastradh: I advertised lambdabot on comp.lang.functional
16:02:00 <Riastradh> Ah, I see.
16:02:08 <shapr> successfully it seems.
16:16:53 <Igloo> Hmmm, I need a game name in order to be able to file this e-mail  :-)
16:17:29 <shapr> right
16:17:49 <shapr> I've thought of AI Wars and ShadowBoxing
16:17:59 <shapr> showing different aspects 
16:18:03 <shapr> Igloo: what do you propose?
16:18:15 <shapr> command and control? =)
16:19:01 * Igloo goes for rts for now  :-)
16:19:14 <shapr> ok
16:19:27 <Igloo> That way I don't have to think  :-)
16:21:14 <shapr> any suggestions?
16:21:34 <Igloo> How about Battle Commander?
16:21:48 <Igloo> Seeing as that's what you play
16:22:13 <shapr> sounds good
16:22:21 <Igloo> Except http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/data/18419.html
16:24:51 <shapr> DangerCurry !
16:25:00 <shapr> BattleFunk
16:25:21 <shapr> BlueFunk
16:25:55 <shapr> embedded real-time battle systems
16:27:14 * Igloo prods shapr for clarification of the radio/cable thing
16:27:32 <delYsid> hmm, can I do pattern-matching on everything except something?
16:27:52 <delYsid> ksq@(~King,_)
16:27:57 <Igloo> I think cable might work out better as far as actually giving orders goes - it will dissuade the "cover the board in comms network" approach
16:28:00 <delYsid> Is that supposed to work?
16:28:09 <Igloo> No
16:28:31 <Igloo> Why not just put the exceptional case first?
16:28:45 <delYsid> ah
16:28:46 <delYsid> yeah
16:28:50 * delYsid scratches head
16:29:15 <shapr> Igloo: eh?
16:29:45 <shapr> Igloo: I was thinking that any time you put up a new con/com building, you assume they have unjammable connections
16:30:08 <Igloo> Oh, errrr, but we didn't even have jammable comms when you said that did we?  :-)
16:30:09 <shapr> Igloo: but that any con/com units would be jammable
16:30:27 <Igloo> Maybe I'm just one step behind you  :-)
16:30:40 <shapr> no, but we were thinking of units that extend the range of con/com as a possibility
16:30:58 * Igloo decides to write another mail
16:30:59 <shapr> and I was suggesting that they have some strong disadvantage as a balance
16:31:35 <Igloo> Oh, I see, so cables to buildings and radio to vehicles?
16:31:47 <shapr> some possible disadvantages would be jammable, enemy sees radio transmitters on his minimap/shaded map making that a good spot to aim his artillery
16:31:52 <shapr> right, exactly
16:33:36 <Igloo> Right, so you would expect cable out to defense perimeter and order relaying to offensive teams
16:34:58 * Igloo aborts the mail
16:36:58 <shapr> right
16:37:30 * Igloo wonders what to do now
16:41:49 <shapr> ?
16:47:50 <shapr> hi Fractal 
17:01:51 <shapr> @yow
17:01:52 <lambdabot> Then, it's off to RED CHINA!!
17:02:47 <Riastradh> @yow
17:02:48 <lambdabot> Pardon me, but do you know what it means to be TRULY ONE
17:02:48 <lambdabot>  with your BOOTH!
17:13:12 <debug> :)
17:13:18 * debug falls into debug mode
17:13:22 <debug> goodnight
17:14:40 <Igloo> night
