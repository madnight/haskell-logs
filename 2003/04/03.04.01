00:21:46 <Marvin--> wtf is this 'default' declaration?

00:36:20 <Marvin--> is this good?
00:36:40 <pesco> Behold! This is powerpc-unknown-linux talking!
00:37:17 <pesco> GHC is building its libraries from _Haskell_ source!
00:38:43 <pesco> Which means, simply put, that I have just obtained a working version of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System version 4.08.3 for my Titanium PowerBook running Gentoo Linux.
00:39:07 <pesco> I think I am the first person to accomplish this.
00:40:02 <pesco> Or anyone else who has previously made it is a giant ass for not saving me two days of struggle with the GHC build system.
00:40:38 <Marvin--> aha
00:42:26 <pesco> Oh I am so proud. Many users of Linux/PPC will enjoy this.
00:42:41 * pesco tries to calm down again
00:43:55 <pesco> The build is not over yet, and I don't know whether the compiler produces working code at all.
02:41:32 <shapr> y0
02:41:55 <shapr> hey dnm 
02:42:26 <dnm> hey shapr
02:42:32 <shapr> wassup?
02:42:39 <dnm> Not much. You?
02:42:50 * mgoetze bounces
02:42:54 <shapr> I've been writing a bunch of fun code lately :-)
02:42:56 * shapr boings
02:42:58 <shapr> hi mgoetze 
02:43:45 <shapr> dnm: oh, I just had a green card interview at the migrationsverket
02:43:51 <shapr> that was exciting.
02:44:09 <dnm> shapr: How'd that go?
02:44:15 <mgoetze> shapr: green card? like, you interview people who want to go to $unspeakable_place?
02:44:34 <shapr> dnm: I think I'll get one year
02:44:49 <shapr> mgoetze: green card means "residence/work permit" in the USA at least
02:45:13 <shapr> dnm: oh, look at my fun code...
02:45:14 <shapr> lambdabot: @source
02:45:15 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know that command, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
02:45:17 <shapr> whoops
02:45:19 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact source
02:45:19 <lambdabot>  http://sf.net/projects/haskell-libs/, http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haskell-libs/libs/lambdabot/
02:45:24 <mgoetze> shapr: well, as far as i'm aware, it's only for the usa, and i thought you were from there anyway?
02:45:34 <shapr> yes, but sweden has the same sort of thing
02:45:44 <shapr> I doubt their card is green, but you know what I mean
02:45:58 <shapr> I didn't want to be deported =)
02:47:06 <shapr> lambdabot now does @commands in privmsg also, but I haven't checked in that change.
02:48:17 <dnm> shapr: If you want me to look at anything, best bet is to email me, since I'm only passingly in IRC, and not paying continuous attention *right* now because I'm picking up the room.
02:48:19 <mgoetze> shapr: oh. well, please say residence/work permit then, so that i don't get confused :)
02:48:20 <dnm> dnm@pobox.com
02:48:41 <shapr> dnm: ok, I'll mail you the lambdabot sources ;-)
02:49:06 * mgoetze , meanwhile, bounces some more.
02:49:42 * shapr boings some
02:50:41 <mgoetze> damn, my debian cd is corrupt
02:50:58 * mgoetze will have to do some renetworking.
02:56:16 <shapr> renetworking?
02:56:56 <mgoetze> get a second ethernet card in the machine with the adsl connection so that i can route through for a netinstall :)
02:57:04 <shapr> ah
04:08:32 * shapr boings
04:10:29 * o3 kicks mac os x
04:10:36 <o3> silly beefcake
04:10:47 <shapr> kicks are for trids

04:18:09 <mgoetze> shapr: you need to put some more exciting stuff at iohcc.mgoetze.net :)
04:18:12 <shapr> heh
04:18:20 <shapr> well 
04:18:23 <shapr> it was a short contest
04:18:26 <shapr> and really just a prototype
04:18:47 <shapr> my conclusions so far have been: a) it's fun and worthwhile b) judging takes forever
04:18:55 <mgoetze> but, i mean, i should be able to get up to a gig at least :)
04:18:58 <Igloo> Any word from dark?
04:19:04 <shapr> Igloo: nope, nothing
04:19:07 <shapr> I'll email him specifically
04:19:32 <shapr> I understand that Chilli is trying to write a paper for HW
04:19:35 <mgoetze> feel free to use the mailing list all you like for intra-jury communication :)
04:19:41 <Igloo> mgoetze: You can be the primary source of my pretty animations if you like  :-)
04:19:58 <mgoetze> Igloo: uhm, how much traffic will that be?
04:19:59 <shapr> yah, let's host more Haskell stuff on mgoetze.net =)
04:20:42 <Igloo> No idea...probably less than 10M*10*30
04:21:13 <Igloo> I've only made one so far, though  :-)
04:21:20 <mgoetze> 10 hits per day a 10mb?
04:21:43 <Igloo> That's 30 people (ever) looking at 10 animations
04:21:59 <shapr> Igloo: so, when should we start writing a PanIce plugin for Netscape?
04:22:24 <shapr> then the very small animation sources could be rendered client side =)
04:22:44 <shapr> actually, writing a demo client-side plugin for Netscape using Haskell/FFI would be immensely spiffy
04:23:38 <Igloo> Well, ideally the programs would run fast enough to generate the animations in real-time
04:23:42 <Igloo> Sadly not at the moment, though
04:24:30 * Igloo has given up on performance tuning until I have the new implementation done
04:24:49 <Igloo> It now does CSE, although it's not pretty
04:33:47 <shapr> Igloo: cool
04:34:09 <shapr> Igloo: when do we get to see the latest version?
04:35:47 <Igloo> Well, it doesn't actually work on real images yet, just toy expressions
04:36:14 * Igloo is gradually growing my tiny datastructures up to the TH ones
04:36:28 <shapr> yay! more TH stuff!
04:36:31 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact Igloo 
04:36:31 <lambdabot> Nothing

04:36:39 <shapr> whew
04:36:45 <Igloo> :-)
04:36:49 <shapr> I need to take away case sensitivity in @fact
04:36:59 * shapr adds that to the TODO
04:46:59 <shapr> pesco: hey, I saw in the logs that you got it compiling, yay!
04:51:28 <mgoetze> hey, rms wrote an april fool's too!
04:51:36 <shapr> Igloo: do you know anything about changing the <- notation to something more generic?
04:51:41 <shapr> what the heck is mdo?
04:51:49 <shapr> is that about non-sequential monadic operations?
04:52:00 <shapr> is there already an arrow style <- ?
04:52:25 <shapr> lambdabot: wassup?
04:52:25 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
04:52:41 <shapr> lambdabot: @fortune
04:52:41 <lambdabot> The way these things go, there are probably 6 or 8 kludgey ways to do
04:52:41 <lambdabot> it, and a better way that involves rethinking something that hasn't
04:52:41 <lambdabot> been rethunk yet.

04:54:35 <lambdabot> Nothing
04:54:49 <Darius> lambdabot: @fact Arrows
04:54:49 <lambdabot> Nothing
04:55:39 <Darius> The annoying thing about arrow syntax is that it isn't the almost trivial transform that do-notation is
04:57:30 <shapr> I know very little about arrows
04:57:55 <shapr> I think they're more efficient for stream processing, from reading the first arrows paper
04:57:59 <Igloo> shapr: I don't, sorry. I think arrows are done with a preprocessor, BICBW
04:58:09 <shapr> so, I would assume they could be useful for lambdabot 
04:58:29 <shapr> so it seems like swapping lambdabot to using arrows would be a good way to figure out just how useful they are.
04:58:34 <shapr> or if lambdabot is a good application of arrows
04:58:55 <shapr> after the 1.0 release of course =)
05:01:52 <shapr> Riastradh: you're in haskell-libs as a developer
05:01:57 <shapr> Riastradh: you got da powah
05:02:09 <mgoetze> da responsibiliteh!
05:02:25 <shapr> dah privileges!
05:02:53 <shapr> I should get off my lazy butt and make a homepage for haskell-libs
05:02:56 <shapr> hey
05:03:06 <shapr> I could redirect it to HaskellLibs on the HaskellWiki
05:03:07 <mgoetze> libs.haskell.mgoetze.net? :)
05:03:17 <shapr> hm, good idea
05:03:28 <shapr> the advantage of a wiki would be that other people could edit it
05:03:34 <shapr> mgoetze: do you have a wiki on your site?
05:03:42 <mgoetze> uhm, nope
05:03:45 <mgoetze> should i? :)
05:03:54 <shapr> wanna create a #haskell wiki?
05:04:05 <mgoetze> sounds interesting
05:04:17 <mgoetze> let's talk about it when i get home
05:04:20 <shapr> ok
05:04:24 * shapr bounces happily
05:04:37 <shapr> oh, it looks like I won't be going to germany after all :-(
05:04:48 <mgoetze> oh
05:04:56 <shapr> the client can only afford one plane ticket, and they want Beatrice...
05:05:00 <mgoetze> well, maybe another time :)
05:05:10 <shapr> yah, we'll get together and have a beer at some point.
05:06:02 * mgoetze doesn't drink beer, but otherwise yes :)
05:07:05 <mgoetze> anyhow, time for me to get going
05:07:09 <mgoetze> back in ~1h
05:07:19 <shapr> :-)
05:19:18 <Smerdyakov> Don't you know that all Germans drink beer??
05:35:58 <LoganH> Bier!
05:36:19 <LoganH> Next year's programming contest will be in Prague.  I might try to hit Germany on the way there.
06:26:58 <shapr> I wish this microsoft joystick weren't right handed
06:30:32 <shapr> have you guys seen the "Galois Homework" service sent to haskell@haskell.org ?
06:30:38 <shapr> it's very funny :-)
06:32:14 <mgoetze> shapr: so, uhm, what advantages would a #haskell wiki have over the haskell wiki?
06:32:35 <shapr> good question
06:33:13 <shapr> I think that people are unlikely to put up a Q&A page about LambdaBot on the real HaskellWiki
06:33:26 <shapr> but they might on a wiki specific to the #haskell channel
06:33:37 <shapr> what do you think?
06:33:47 <mgoetze> well, hm, can't you just tell them to do it on haskellwiki?
06:33:52 <shapr> yah, ok
06:33:53 <shapr> I will.
06:34:30 * mgoetze looks what wiki engines are packaged in debian
06:35:16 * shapr is tempted to write a wiki in Haskell
06:35:24 <shapr> of course, that would irritate o3, so I won't =)
06:35:49 <mgoetze> hehe
06:37:06 <shapr> lambdabot: @listmodules
06:37:06 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["fact","fortune","hello","state","system","topic"]
06:37:49 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact discussion http://haskell.org/wiki/wiki?LambdaBot
06:37:49 <lambdabot> set discussion to http://haskell.org/wiki/wiki?LambdaBot
06:40:58 <shapr> yay! someone else is writing an RFC2822 parser!
06:41:08 <shapr> and they want to steal some ideas/code from what I've written
06:41:09 <shapr> w00
06:41:17 <shapr> AND he wants to put it into haskell-libs
06:41:20 <shapr> can it get any better? =)
06:41:29 <Smerdyakov> Yay! shapr shows a nomenclature fetish by repeatedly referring to things by RFC numbers!
06:41:46 <shapr> Smerdyakov: hey, we don't get to choose our fetishes.
06:41:56 <shapr> you just buy them from a witch doctor.
06:42:06 <shapr> ya know, whatever he has on sale.
06:42:16 <shapr> Smerdyakov: would you like to write a lambdabot plugin?
06:42:49 <Smerdyakov> No. I'd like to make it through 5 more weeks of school and graduate without pissing off any of the people with whom I'll have to interact in the years to come. :
06:42:50 <Smerdyakov> :P
06:42:55 <shapr> since you've written a webserver, I'm sure you would have some excellent suggestions on structuring the code.
06:43:42 * Smerdyakov goes away: shower
06:45:34 <shapr> yow
06:45:44 <shapr> this guy just sent me eight thousands lines of code
06:46:04 <shapr> I hope this is mostly comments =-O
06:46:19 <mgoetze> what does the code do?
06:46:50 <shapr> files are named RFC2068 RFC2234 RFC2822 and TestSuite
06:47:46 <mgoetze> anyhow, i need to do some hardware reconfiguration, bbs
06:47:56 * shapr bounces happily

06:51:13 <shapr> K0D3
06:51:41 <esap> That's good.
06:53:41 <esap> uh oh, it's April fools again :-) Slashdot is filled with jokes.
06:54:06 <mgoetze> i like the ones on www.deadly.org
06:54:53 <Marvin--> I liked the gentoo/rpm joke :-)
06:57:01 <esap> yea, that's funny.
06:57:16 <mgoetze> here's another good one: irc.openprojects.net is an alias for irc.oftc.net.
06:57:20 <mgoetze> ;)

07:04:10 <Smerdyakov> Anyone who does such things to "celebrate April Fools' Day" needs to get a life.
07:06:39 <esap> Heh, well I've been bored too, I actually participated in the IOHCC :-)
07:08:20 <esap> Hmm.. the uk mirror does not have the "news".
07:15:07 --- topic: set to '#freenode' by Segora

07:18:17 <mgoetze> Marvin--: i didn't mean it like that :P
07:19:29 <Marvin--> mgoetze: then perhaps you should have said "see the topic of #freenode" instead
07:20:41 <mgoetze> i think i'll go for: /list #freenode
07:21:56 * shapr bounces
07:21:59 <shapr> yay! ordered keyboard!
07:22:40 <psy> a girl spilled water on my keyboard last night, now it's wrecked (or needs more drying out)
07:22:59 <psy> 125789 are the only working numbers, and none of the odd F-keys work :/
07:23:17 <shapr> :-(
07:23:22 <shapr> psy: was she a cute girl?
07:23:35 <shapr> did she give you lots of attention to make up for it?
07:23:42 <psy> thankfully, yes and yes
07:23:47 <shapr> w00!
07:23:54 <Marvin--> then I think you're on the plus side anyway ;)
07:23:59 <shapr> yah, totally
07:23:59 <psy> but still..it's a nice keyboard. cordless!
07:24:38 <shapr> lesee, keyboard... female attention...
07:24:50 <shapr> I'd always choose female attention =)
07:24:55 <psy> 'twas a small price to pay :)
07:25:01 * shapr laughs
07:25:14 <mgoetze> why doesn't this work? :(
07:25:28 * mgoetze ha two computers connected to a switch, and they can't ping each other
07:25:35 <shapr> psy: see, now you have to ask her if she'd like to help you repair that keyboard.
07:25:48 <psy> mgoetze: their network/mask don't match
07:25:50 <shapr> mgoetze: can you do ping .255 ?
07:26:03 <mgoetze> shapr: yes, but it doesn't help
07:26:05 <psy> shapr: unfortunately i don't think i'll be seeing her again
07:26:07 <Marvin--> repair == snuggling while waiting for it to dry?
07:26:10 <psy> shapr: cute as she was, she was a bit annoying :)
07:26:13 <shapr> Marvin--: YES
07:26:49 <shapr> in college, I majored in women.
07:26:57 <Marvin--> heh
07:27:23 <shapr> I got called a womanizer occasionally, so I guess I learned my lessons.
07:27:54 <shapr> Marvin--: oh, lambdabot privmsg should work now
07:28:03 <shapr> with just the command
07:28:36 <Marvin--> uh, no?
07:28:46 <Marvin--> ah, @fortune
07:28:54 <shapr> it was sending me a big long fortune =)
07:29:02 <shapr> looks like a need for threading
07:29:25 <Marvin--> yay, Oscar Wilde
07:29:35 * mgoetze ponders whether to get the huge switch from upstairs, or to try some different cables first.
07:29:45 <shapr> mgoetze: do you have a cross-cable?
07:29:58 <Marvin--> "Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods.  They worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them.   -- Oscar Wilde"
07:30:05 <shapr> if so, plug it into both computers and then test
07:30:13 * shapr grins
07:30:15 <mgoetze> shapr: don't think i do.
07:30:41 <shapr> cross-cables are handy for direct connect testing and for connecting switches to each other
07:31:17 <mgoetze> my switch has an uplink port for that :)
07:31:25 <mgoetze> i mean, my small switch
07:35:31 <shapr> wow, this guys email parser is gorgeous
07:36:29 <shapr> he even included HUnit tests
07:36:31 * shapr is mightily impressed
07:40:46 <shapr> oh he did an ABNF parser for Parsec
07:40:47 <shapr> brilliant
07:46:16 <mgoetze> different switch, one cable changed, still no ping
07:46:43 <shapr> mgoetze: do you have a link light?
07:47:34 <mgoetze> on one of the ethernet cards, yes. it's lit. also, the switch blinks whenever there's traffic on that port, and it's doing so regularily and at the same time on both ports.
07:47:57 <shapr> sounds like you have something.

07:50:50 <shapr> yes, on .6

07:51:00 <mgoetze> yes

07:52:25 <mgoetze> routing table on corelli seems to be fine
07:52:43 <shapr> but you can't reach corelli from the switch side, right?
07:52:59 <mgoetze> (kinda heard to copy verbatim since i have a data switch to switch i/o between them)
07:53:03 <mgoetze> "switch side"?
07:53:04 <shapr> yah, I understand
07:53:29 <shapr> you can't ping corelli's eth1 from the LAN, yes?
07:53:49 <mgoetze> can't ping corelli's eth0 from prokofjew
07:54:08 <mgoetze> (only other network card in corelli is a token ring card not supported by linux)
07:55:14 <mgoetze> i think i'll try booting the install system on corelli with a 2.4 kernel, who knows...
07:55:22 <shapr> the route you pasted above is pointing to eth1
07:55:32 <mgoetze> prokofjew's eth1
07:55:33 <shapr> is that the routing table from corelli?
07:55:40 <mgoetze> no, that's from prokofjew
07:55:47 <shapr> ohh
07:58:36 <shapr> do you have a 192.168.42.0 route on corelli?
07:59:31 <mgoetze> yeah
07:59:31 <shapr> want me to /msg you the route from my gateway box? think it'll help?
07:59:46 <mgoetze> no, i think i know my way around routing tables pretty well, actually :(
07:59:50 <shapr> ok
08:00:02 <shapr> well, if I can do anything, ask me :-)
08:00:26 <mgoetze> well, you could tell me what the problem is :)
08:00:36 * shapr laughs
08:00:42 <shapr> sadly, I don't know.
08:00:57 <Igloo> =
08:01:00 <shapr> if your link lights are flashing, it sounds like a config problem
08:01:02 <Igloo> Ooops
08:01:10 <shapr> ==
08:03:44 <mgoetze> well, waddaya know, apparently with bf24, it doesn't autodetect the network card, but it does manage to recover from read errors from the cd
08:04:10 <shapr> bf24?
08:04:18 <shapr> is that a kernel patch thingy?
08:05:06 <Segora> maybe boot floppies with kernel 2.4 (Debian)?
08:05:18 <shapr> oh, probably so
08:05:22 <shapr> hi Segora 
08:05:25 <Segora> hi shapr
08:05:29 <shapr> wassup?
08:05:55 <Segora> well, i'm still thinking of the presentation Joe Armstrong did here in Karlsruhe on saturday
08:06:11 <Segora> it was amazing
08:06:27 <shapr> is that really you with a mustache?
08:06:38 <Segora> where?
08:06:43 <shapr> http://rzstud1.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uk0b/self.html
08:07:16 <Segora> oh my god. that photo is _OLD_!
08:07:21 <shapr> the name Joe Armstrong sounds familiar, but I can't place it.
08:07:27 <Segora> of Erlang fame
08:07:34 <shapr> ohh
08:07:34 <shapr> him!
08:07:54 <shapr> I've seen his posts on c.l.f
08:08:09 <shapr> I want to 'borrow' a bunch of the ideas of Erlang into Haskell :-)
08:08:35 <Segora> which?
08:08:44 <shapr> hot loading first of all
08:09:01 <shapr> truly distributed applications second of all
08:09:30 <Segora> hmm. that will be hard to do consistently in a Haskell environment
08:09:39 <shapr> maybe..
08:10:17 <shapr> right now all the loading stuff in GHC happens with win32 DLLs or .o or .so files on Linux
08:10:28 <shapr> the advantage of Erlang is that it does its own loading
08:10:46 <shapr> it's not dependent on anything from the OS
08:11:14 <Segora> hmm.
08:11:22 <shapr> I figure the hot loading and real distributed apps are interconnected ideas
08:11:44 <Segora> now. you don't need code hot-swapping for distribution.
08:11:51 <Segora> s/now/no/
08:12:06 <Marvin--> heh, moshez doesn't seem to like Swedish distances
08:12:13 <shapr> Marvin--: what does that mean?
08:12:23 <shapr> Segora: ok, I should have said "complementary"
08:12:44 <Marvin--> I said that Göteborg is really close to Oslo, so he could pop in here on his way to debconf this summer
08:12:51 <Marvin--> i.e. four hours by train
08:12:53 * shapr laughs
08:12:53 <Marvin--> he thought I was insane
08:13:17 <shapr> I would consider that nearby
08:13:24 <mgoetze> the problem is not the distances
08:13:26 <Segora> shapr: well of course if you have a distributed system, you can do hot-swapping by moving all applications to a different node, taking down the node, installing new code, restarting and moving the apps back. ;)
08:13:29 <mgoetze> it's that you have slow trains :)
08:13:31 <Marvin--> but he's from .il :)
08:13:38 <shapr> Segora: yah, exactly
08:13:39 <Marvin--> mgoetze: we have fast trains too, but not to Oslo
08:13:54 <shapr> I wanted first class serializable continuations in Stackless Python for just that reason.
08:13:58 <Marvin--> Göteborg <-> Stockholm is three hours with the fast trains, and almost six with the slow ones
08:14:13 <mgoetze> why would anyone want to go to oslo? it's too bloody expensive
08:14:21 <shapr> debconf will be there
08:14:26 <shapr> I'll go if I can afford it.
08:14:33 <shapr> though I'd prefer to go to AFP in chalmers actually
08:14:50 <Marvin--> mgoetze: debconf3
08:14:52 <shapr> is AFP free for swedish taxpayers?
08:15:16 <ludde> AFP ?
08:15:30 <shapr> advanced functional programming classes in the summer
08:15:31 <Marvin--> shapr: yes and no
08:15:35 <ludde> at chalmers?
08:15:37 <Marvin--> in the summer?
08:15:40 <Marvin--> you mean the fall?
08:15:45 <shapr> er, ok
08:15:56 <Marvin--> or does the afp summer school move around?
08:16:05 <shapr> I thought it was a week-long heavy duty FP workshop thingy?
08:16:12 <mgoetze> Marvin--: still, too expensive :)
08:16:22 <ludde> that's not at chalmers
08:16:26 <shapr> oh
08:16:37 * shapr googles before making anymore confused statements
08:16:46 <ludde> that's at oxford ?
08:16:59 <shapr> ok, I'm totally lost.
08:17:03 <shapr> it's been a very strange day.
08:17:24 <Marvin--> shapr: that's the afp summer school... our afp is a half-semester course
08:17:36 <shapr> oh
08:17:53 <shapr> that's the thing you suggested I come to, for learning about monad transformers, etc?
08:18:10 <Marvin--> yes
08:18:26 <shapr> half-semester sounds longer than a week or two
08:18:31 <Marvin--> yes?
08:18:33 <ludde> it's 7 weeks
08:18:37 <shapr> ah well..
08:18:38 <Igloo> The SS does move around
08:18:41 <Marvin--> when did I ever say that it was just a week or two?
08:18:48 <shapr> Marvin--: I was confused =)
08:18:54 <Marvin--> afpss is more advanced than our afp though
08:19:14 <Igloo> I've been lucky in that the two things I've wanted to go to so far as a dPhil student have been in Oxford  :-)
08:19:21 <Marvin--> our afp is "advanced" compared to the introduction class :)
08:19:28 <shapr> ah, I see.
08:19:50 <shapr> when's the 2003 afpss?
08:20:05 <Marvin--> and where?
08:20:29 <Igloo> No idea
08:20:30 <shapr> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/afp/
08:20:45 <shapr> I think it should be at chalmers so I can go to it =)
08:20:56 <shapr> no wait, Luleå !
08:20:59 * shapr grins
08:21:39 <Marvin--> not decided yet, huh?
08:22:00 <shapr> I guess so
08:22:07 <shapr> looks like they don't have them every year.
08:24:21 <tic> chalmers?
08:24:30 <shapr> chalmers.se
08:24:33 <Marvin--> weeell, they might as well wait until I'm a PhD student ;)
08:24:34 <tic> what about Chalmers?
08:24:46 <shapr> tic: nice place, wish I could go to school there.
08:24:50 <ludde> is it morally incorrect to do other people's labs for money?
08:24:55 <tic> shapr, I am. :)
08:25:00 <Marvin--> ludde: yes
08:25:05 <shapr> tic: I'm jealous, okay? ;-)
08:25:09 <tic> shapr, :)
08:25:14 <ludde> I got $30 yesterday for doing someone's lab.. someone in the us
08:25:19 <tic> shapr, had my first programming class for John Hughes
08:25:29 * shapr falls out of his chair with envy
08:25:33 <tic> shapr, and if/when I read Advanced Functional Programming, I'll have him again
08:25:41 <ludde> tic: you're a dtek student?
08:25:41 <Marvin--> ludde: I guess the chances of being suspended are pretty small then
08:25:42 <shapr> tic: I WANT TO LEARN ARROWS.
08:25:47 <Marvin--> tic: or Koen
08:25:47 * shapr bounces furiously
08:25:50 <tic> that guy really knows his way around haskell
08:25:57 <Marvin--> tic: Koen's held it the last two years afaik
08:25:59 <shapr> who, John Hughes?
08:26:02 <tic> shapr, we didn't learn about monads
08:26:05 <ludde> Marvin--: uh, chalmers can't really complain about that, can they
08:26:08 <tic> Marvin--, at Chalmers?
08:26:10 <Marvin--> ludde: no
08:26:11 <Marvin--> tic: yes
08:26:15 <tic> Marvin--, ah, okay.
08:26:22 <ludde> tic: you're a dtek student at chalmers?
08:26:22 <Marvin--> ludde: but had you done someone's lab here, you'd probably be suspended
08:26:25 <tic> ludde, yup
08:26:34 <ludde> Marvin--: yeah, but that's a completely different thing. I wouldn't do that for money.
08:26:45 <shapr> I think it's the same thing.
08:26:47 <Marvin--> oh, oh, I think I solved how to handle guards in my master project thingy :-)
08:26:53 <shapr> yay!
08:27:00 <tic> Marvin--, is Koen good?
08:27:04 <ludde> tic: what year
08:27:05 <shapr> tic: yes, I suspect John Hughes knows a thing or two about Haskell.
08:27:13 <tic> ludde, d02
08:27:22 <tic> shapr, yeah ;)
08:27:23 <ludde> tic: ok, i'm d00ludde
08:27:34 <shapr> lessee, he came up with Arrows as a concept, he wrote QuickCheck... he was on the H98 committee ( I think )
08:27:37 <shapr> what else has he done?
08:27:42 <tic> ludde, I'm just "tic" :P  they stripped the year from our dce-ids
08:27:42 <Marvin--> tic: yes, he's very good
08:27:44 <shapr> he still hasn't shown up on #haskell though :-(
08:27:57 <tic> so mail him. :)
08:28:02 <shapr> I have!
08:28:04 <shapr> several times!
08:28:15 <shapr> of course the last time I sent him broken code %-/
08:28:17 <Marvin--> stop stalking him ;)
08:28:20 * tic thought about Johan Karlsson for a moment and thought that he wouldn't show up on IRC, but J. Hughes uses computers. :)
08:28:22 * shapr laughs
08:28:41 * shapr goes off to stalk someone else
08:28:45 * shapr grins
08:28:51 <tic> (x^2+y^2)-Johan
08:29:16 <Marvin--> shapr: I still have a problem with overlapping patterns and overlapping guards, but without overlaps, I think I can simply translate   f p | g = e  to  g ==> f p = e
08:30:07 <shapr> that makes sense.
08:30:20 <Marvin--> so, overlapping is still a problem :/
08:30:25 <shapr> Marvin--: are you writing these as QC tests?
08:30:31 <shapr> the transforms?
08:30:43 <Marvin--> no
08:30:51 <shapr> ok
08:30:53 <Marvin--> but I hope to use the same syntax as QC
08:31:00 <shapr> good idea
08:31:06 <Marvin--> so you can feed the program either through quickcheck or through my program
08:31:19 <shapr> preferably both
08:31:31 <Marvin--> slowprove or whatever it's going to be called :)
08:31:43 <shapr> heheh
08:31:48 <shapr> great name
08:32:23 * Marvin-- listens to his latest Blind Guardian CD
08:32:45 <Marvin--> hey, maybe I should construct that half-orc bard after all
08:32:49 <Marvin--> "Ozzy Orcborn"
08:33:50 * shapr snickers
08:33:53 <shapr> det har jag!
08:33:58 <shapr> or something
08:34:06 <mgoetze> Marvin--: wasn't there a rule about only serious names? :)
08:34:10 <shapr> var är min kvinna?
08:34:20 * shapr hittar
08:34:31 <shapr> they always told me "don't hittar your woman"
08:35:57 <Marvin--> mgoetze: oh, right :)
08:36:04 <Marvin--> shapr: huh?
08:36:31 <Marvin--> mgoetze: can't he at least have "ozzy" as nickname? pretty please? :)
08:37:55 <mgoetze> Marvin--: ask the DM :P
08:38:26 <Marvin--> cha 8 :-P
08:43:18 <Marvin--> bah, Song and Silence doesn't say what the market price for jumping caltroops is
08:43:29 <mgoetze> lol
08:43:40 <mgoetze> waszat?
08:45:42 <Marvin--> animated caltroops :-D
08:45:59 <Marvin--> throw some in an area and they jump around and try to scurry under peoples' feet
08:46:12 <shapr> cockroaches
08:46:18 <shapr> with spikes on their backs
08:46:19 <Marvin--> but pointy
08:46:24 <shapr> yah
08:46:27 <Marvin--> the Thiefcatcher is nifty too
08:46:50 <Marvin--> it's a book that's a magic trap, the first person to open it gets sucked into it
08:47:34 <Marvin--> after that it's harmless, and all the pages are filled with moral stories about how you shouldn't steal
08:47:49 <Marvin--> with the trapped person's name as the protagonist of them all
08:47:53 <shapr> heh
08:48:41 <Marvin--> market price 32250gp, extremely rare
08:48:46 <shapr> yow
08:52:15 <mgoetze> Marvin--: one of my favourite magic items to buy as starting equipment is the bag of tricks
08:53:18 <Marvin--> what does it do?
08:53:42 * shapr improves lambdabot 
08:54:10 <shapr> Marvin--: quick, find an online list of D&D magical items, and I'll put it into postgresql, and make a lambdabot plugin =)
08:54:22 <Marvin--> shapr: www.opengamingcontent.org
08:54:25 <Marvin--> or something like that
08:54:51 <Marvin--> no, http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/srd.html
08:54:54 <mgoetze> Marvin--: you can take a little ball out of it and throw it, and it turns into an animal
08:55:03 <Marvin--> mgoetze: cute!
08:55:05 <shapr> mgoetze: POKEMON
08:55:05 <mgoetze> which you can control
08:55:11 <mgoetze> usable 10 times per week
08:55:27 <Marvin--> hehehe, Geat Cleave rocks for whacking goblins
08:55:32 <Marvin--> *splat* *splat* *splat*
08:56:09 <mgoetze> oh, who needs that? my centaur character has trample :)
08:56:39 <shapr> hrm, I'd have to strip content from rtf
08:56:47 <Marvin--> I want improved crit and a rapier
08:57:01 <Marvin--> crit on 15+ :-)
08:57:15 <Marvin--> shapr: yeah I know, it sucks :/ I use abiword

08:59:40 <Marvin--> heh, Anders always tells lots of tales of his regular D&D gang
08:59:41 <Marvin--> they are insane
08:59:43 <shapr> mgoetze: you have the power
08:59:56 <mgoetze> shapr: hm, you think that will help?

09:02:44 <dennisb> Hej, hello!
09:02:57 <shapr> hur är det med dig?
09:03:09 <mgoetze> Marvin--: how so?
09:03:13 <dennisb> bara fint!
09:03:21 <Marvin--> mgoetze: +2 damage
09:03:28 <dennisb> Now i'm going to watch hockey on tv. Bye for later!
09:03:33 <Marvin--> dennisb: boooring
09:03:35 <shapr> hej da
09:03:36 <dennisb> or bye for now...
09:03:51 <shapr> Marvin--: can you tell me the difference between talar and pratar?
09:03:57 <mgoetze> Marvin--: my centaur does 1d12+8 damage per hit without weapon specialization... don't think another 2 would make much difference :P
09:04:44 <shapr> hei akaihola 
09:05:08 <mgoetze> (also, he has spirited charge, so make that 2d12+16 when there's some room, or 4d12+32 on a critical hit, and i have a keen weapon and am taking improved crit soon :P )
09:05:11 <akaihola> Hi
09:05:20 <shapr> what's up?
09:05:26 <mgoetze> and i'm *not* a powergamer! lol
09:05:46 * shapr writes a powergamer optimization pass for GHC
09:05:49 <shapr> :-P
09:05:52 <Marvin--> "To Shepherds: please contact your "sheep", if not done so already."  wtf is Reiner smoking?
09:06:01 <akaihola> fighting with some linux dial-up problems... no haskell today
09:06:03 <Marvin--> mgoetze: I didn't even know you could play centaur
09:06:11 <shapr> akaihola: aw :-(
09:06:15 <mgoetze> Marvin--: well, only if your dm allows it :)
09:06:20 <Marvin--> mgoetze: exactly
09:06:22 * shapr plays with chanserv options
09:06:33 <Marvin--> mgoetze: 1d12+8 is what? hooves? :)
09:06:45 <mgoetze> Marvin--: actually, the mm does have an ECL listed for centaurs, but it's ridiculously high, as usual
09:06:55 <mgoetze> keen greataxe +1 :)
09:07:04 <mgoetze> hooves do 1d6+7
09:07:07 <Marvin--> mgoetze: well, things in the MM don't level afaik
09:07:17 <Marvin--> the heavy warhorse is pretty nasty too
09:07:36 <mgoetze> some do, if it says "Advancement: By Character Class"
09:07:46 <Marvin--> "keen" greataxe?
09:07:54 <mgoetze> keen increases threat range
09:07:56 <shapr> keen also means "very sharp"
09:08:01 <mgoetze> so i do crits on 19/x3
09:08:25 <mgoetze> (and 18/x3 once i take improved crit)
09:09:04 * pesco shouts from somewhere far back "bwah, does this backlog never end?"
09:09:13 * shapr grins
09:10:13 <mgoetze> *sigh*... my debian cd #3 is too badly damaged :(
09:10:17 <Marvin--> norpan: ohh, are you going to the interviews too? I didn't know
09:10:51 <Marvin--> mgoetze: but a greataxe is just 1d12, right? where does the +8 come from?
09:11:05 <Marvin--> the +1 makes it 1d12+1 obviously
09:11:16 <mgoetze> Marvin--: strength bonus :)
09:11:38 <shapr> I wonder who I need to contact to request a Language :: Haskell entry for sf.net
09:11:54 <mgoetze> it's even more when i rage *g*
09:12:14 <Marvin--> yay! I know people in all four interview groups, that's got to be good
09:15:35 * pesco jumps in
09:15:40 <pesco> Hey there!
09:15:45 <Marvin--> hey pesco :P
09:15:58 <Marvin--> wanna destroy the topic again?
09:16:03 <pesco> No, thanks.
09:16:11 <pesco> I felt really stupid for that.
09:16:55 <mgoetze> you can't destroy the topic now :)
09:16:58 <pesco> Luckily someone else had made the same mistake two pages down the log. That made me feel a little better.
09:17:33 <Marvin--> yeah :)
09:17:33 <pesco> So there, GHC blew it...
09:17:35 <Marvin--> apr 01 17:15:07 ---     Segora has changed the topic to: #freenode
09:18:07 <Marvin--> are all german power metal singers castrated?
09:19:31 <pesco> Bah, GHC builds are really harsh if -split-objs doesn't work because half the library archives end up empty because the expected object files don't show up...
09:20:02 <Marvin--> building GHC isn't for wimps :)
09:20:50 <shapr> when it comes to build GHC, call me a wimp.
09:20:56 <Marvin--> me too
09:21:21 <shapr> I've been failing to build GHC with TH support for months.
09:21:26 <mgoetze> apt-get install ghc5, works for me
09:21:27 <opet> cd /usr/ports/lang/ghc; make build :p
09:21:32 <Darius> At least I can build GHC, they aren't kidding when they say Hat recommends 256MB to build
09:21:53 <opet> (wait.. watch all your memory get eaten up.. wait.. wait..)
09:22:19 <Darius> It's a long wait, thrashing sets in long before then (me with my pitiful 64MB)
09:22:44 <shapr> I have 512mb of ram and (sort of) dual Athlon MP 1544 MHz
09:22:51 <shapr> it still takes many hours to build.
09:23:21 <shapr> I want more ram.
09:23:24 <shapr> at least a gig more
09:23:37 <Darius> shapr: GHC or Hat?
09:23:42 <mgoetze> shapr: sort of?
09:23:48 <shapr> Darius: GHC
09:24:04 <shapr> mgoetze: I blew a CPU cooler recently, haven't gotten it replaced yet, so I'm currently uniprocessor
09:24:18 * mgoetze could do with a dual athlon mp...
09:24:19 <shapr> the other CPU is in a bag on the shelf
09:24:24 <shapr> it's very speedy
09:24:30 <shapr> you can also heat your entire house with it.
09:24:36 <mgoetze> hehe
09:24:53 <shapr> I have only four extra case fans and a 450W power supply in this box
09:24:56 <shapr> I need more of both.
09:26:42 <pesco> Yes! YES!
09:26:52 <shapr> it's working?
09:27:28 <pesco> It finished building, now the test...
09:27:32 <shapr> w00
09:28:15 <pesco> WOOOOOH
09:28:25 <shapr> it tests out okay?
09:29:17 <pesco> Hello, Cat, and Echo all compile and run smoothly!!
09:29:20 <mgoetze> shapr: more 450W power supplies?
09:29:38 <pesco> shapr: Thank you very much for the encouragement the other day.
09:29:44 <pesco> This is really great.
09:31:31 <shapr> pesco: yay!
09:31:45 <shapr> mgoetze: yes, I have space for a second PSU in this case.
09:32:14 <shapr> pesco: I'm desperately curious, does lambdabot compile??
09:32:38 <pesco> shapr: Oh, lemme try, I just set out to try to compile GHC 5...
09:32:55 <emu> why is ghc so hard to compile
09:32:56 <pesco> shapr: Although it probably won't because it uses hirarchical libs
09:33:17 <pesco> emu: Because I'm using powerpc-unknown-linux here, which is not supported.
09:33:30 <emu> on a dual athlon mp
09:33:46 <shapr> emu: it just takes a long long time.
09:33:47 <mgoetze> shapr: and the mainboard supports it as well?
09:34:00 <emu> why?
09:34:36 <shapr> partially because it compiles itself twice
09:34:53 <emu> not unheard of
09:34:58 <emu> still shouldn't take hours
09:35:13 <shapr> mgoetze: I dunno, I was going to plug all the case fans and drives into the second PSU
09:36:22 <mgoetze> shapr: oh.... hm... but it's atx? will it actually, you know, go on?
09:36:45 <shapr> huh?
09:37:11 <mgoetze> well, i always have trouble getting any power from atx psu's unless they're plugged into a mainboard
09:37:40 <mgoetze> because one of those cables tells them to be turned on
09:37:42 <shapr> I've never used a PSU without it being attached to a mainboard, so I dunno
09:37:50 <shapr> that does make sense though
09:38:03 <shapr> maybe I should just get a stronger one and use it for everything
09:38:05 <mgoetze> no, it doesn't make sense, it's just the way it is ;)
09:38:19 <mgoetze> no, you should get a mainboard that supports redundant PSUs ;)
09:38:35 <shapr> I actually don't know if this one does
09:44:33 <mgoetze> sigh... so many packages i need to delete after a "clean" debian install
09:44:50 <shapr> lambdabot: @quit
09:46:00 * shapr implements Igloo's suggest for state initializing
09:47:45 <pesco> Ok, GHC 5 build is running, but I have to leave for now... :(
09:50:18 * shapr laughs very much at the april fools jokes roaming haskell@haskell.org
09:50:40 <shapr> Y-agra is hysterical
09:50:48 <shapr> You will not get side-effects without monadic stimulation - no need to
09:50:48 <shapr> be embarrassed like when you use other computational aids.
09:51:13 <shapr> This is the easiest and most discreet way to END IMPERATENCE.
09:51:13 <shapr> It's ALL NATRUAL!  Made with one of life's most essential combinators,
09:51:13 <shapr> Y-agra has been used for decades!  The pleasure is INFINITE!
09:52:57 <pesco> I liked URGENT much better, though.
09:53:10 <pesco> (btw, screwing my weekly workout...)
09:53:24 <shapr> you must exercise!
09:53:26 <shapr> it's good for you!
09:53:26 <pesco> I feel bad now.
09:53:54 <pesco> I just came back from a straight week of fun in the snow.
09:53:59 <shapr> well
09:54:00 <shapr> that's ok then
09:54:06 <pesco> *g* I feel better.
09:54:10 <shapr> :-)
09:54:17 <esap> Hmm.. I'm wondering. The Monad class allows you to raise exceptions, but not catch them. Does this strike anyone else as an interesting choice of interface?
09:54:43 <shapr> you throw them up in the air, and they come down by themselves.
09:55:29 * shapr looks for how to catch exceptions
09:55:46 <esap> I can't see any way that would not bind me to a specific kind of monad.
09:55:58 <Marvin--> look at MonadError
09:56:00 <shapr> you mean fail?
09:56:20 <esap> shapr: yes.
09:56:46 <Marvin--> esap: catching is kinda tricky... you might want to read the papers on imprecise exceptions
09:58:06 <esap> marvin: ok, I'll read it. Is MonadError part of the Haskell98, or only extension in the library?
09:58:22 <shapr> yay, two new haskell-libs developers today
09:59:11 <Marvin--> esap: no it's not in H98
09:59:17 <Marvin--> but I think both hugs and ghc have it
09:59:38 <Marvin--> though I don't remember if MonadError is related to the imprecise exceptions
10:00:13 <shapr> do guys think regression tests go in the same dir with sources?
10:01:10 <Marvin--> depends, if there's just one file with several tests, I just have a 'tests.py
10:01:16 <Marvin--> er, test.ext
10:01:20 <Marvin--> otherwise I have a tests subdir
10:01:34 <esap> marvin: it's actually interesting design for the MonadError. I wasn't aware you need functional dependencies to do that.
10:03:51 <pesco> This is amazing, I'm actually witnessing the compilation of GHC 5 by GHC 4 on my PowerBook.
10:03:55 <esap> marvin: another interesting thing is that there is no instance of MonadError for Maybe. Hmm.. I guess I need to read more about that.
10:04:27 <pesco> I should capture this on video tape or something.
10:04:35 <shapr> pesco: what?
10:04:48 <pesco> The porting of GHC to a new arch.
10:04:54 <shapr> oh :-)
10:04:56 <pesco> I'm keeping a diary though.
10:05:22 <pesco> recording all the traps
10:05:26 <shapr> oh, good idea
10:06:05 * andersca boings
10:06:10 * shapr bounces
10:06:11 <shapr> hi andersca 
10:07:56 <shapr> hi Vincenz 
10:07:57 <shapr> wassup?
10:08:16 <Vincenz> nothing much
10:08:23 <Vincenz> stuck on a slight problem
10:08:27 <Vincenz> well not exactly problem
10:08:29 <Vincenz> but I'm lazy
10:08:32 <shapr> :-)
10:08:34 <Vincenz> (and I don't know STL)
10:08:39 <Vincenz> it's a c++ question though
10:08:49 <shapr> I don't know anything about C++
10:08:57 <Vincenz> hehe :)
10:09:15 <Vincenz> I don't quite much either, but I created a smartpointer today :) now I need a hashtable in C++ (no idea how to do that)
10:09:30 <Marvin--> hashtable<k,v> t?
10:09:33 <Vincenz> (besides slow...crappy...self implementations)
10:09:45 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I need some extra functionality though
10:09:50 <Vincenz> perhaps I could explain the problem?
10:09:59 <pesco> Vincenz: shoot, I know some C++, too.
10:10:01 <Marvin--> no, I don't have the energy to think C++ :/
10:10:02 <Vincenz> well
10:10:08 <Vincenz> I created a smartpointer today
10:10:17 <Marvin--> what's a smart pointer?
10:10:18 <Vincenz> cause I have multiple threads loading fonts...(yaggity yag)
10:10:22 <pesco> smart as in reference counting?
10:10:27 <Vincenz> that would be the idea
10:10:37 <Vincenz> but now I need a static look up table between the different instances
10:10:49 <Vincenz> so that I can look up a font for a given "fontnamefontsize"
10:10:53 <Vincenz> and the number of references to it
10:10:58 <Vincenz> I'm thinking hashmap
10:11:00 <Vincenz> but I need two keys
10:11:10 <Vincenz> (actual font, a pointer, and a refcount)
10:11:18 <Marvin--> hashtable<pair<k1,k2>,v>  :/
10:11:24 <Vincenz> I mean, two values, sorry :P
10:11:34 <Marvin--> hashtable<k,pair<v1,v2>> then :P
10:11:38 <Vincenz> hashtable is std stl?
10:11:40 <pesco> Vinc: I thought you had your smartpointer in a class?
10:11:43 <Marvin--> I don't remember what it's called
10:11:46 <pesco> hashtable is not stl.
10:11:50 <Vincenz> I looked it up in MSVC dox, couldn't find it
10:11:52 <Vincenz> no I thought so
10:11:53 <pesco> Ther is no hashtabel in the STL.
10:11:58 <Vincenz> map is the furthest STL goes
10:12:08 <pesco> But I don't think you need the hash, wouldn't std::map do it just fine?
10:12:13 <Vincenz> I don't feel like going down each font and doing a string compare
10:12:23 <Marvin--> no, it's probably just map<...>
10:12:32 <pesco> Eek, GCC implements std::map as a red-black tree!
10:12:32 <Marvin--> template <class _Key, class _Tp, class _Compare = less<_Key>,
10:12:32 <Marvin-->           class _Alloc = allocator<pair<const _Key, _Tp> > >
10:12:32 <Marvin--> class map
10:12:43 <Vincenz> hmm
10:12:55 * Vincenz wishes he knew Template-syntax
10:13:17 * pesco whishes he didn't know template syntax
10:13:23 <Vincenz> pesco: lol
10:13:30 <Marvin--> map<string, int> tbl; <- would be a table with strings for keys and ints for values
10:13:35 <Vincenz> I'm having great fun learning ocaml though, it's quite a neat syntax
10:13:42 <Vincenz> Marvin--: ah thank you :)
10:13:52 <pesco> Actually that's a lie, I'd just rather not know about the metaprogramming stunts that become possible with it.
10:13:56 <Marvin--> I think [] is overloaded so you can do things like  tbl["foo"]
10:14:15 <pesco> Yes it is.
10:14:17 <Marvin-->   _Tp& operator[](const key_type& __k) {
10:14:18 <Marvin-->     iterator __i = lower_bound(__k);
10:14:18 <Marvin-->     // __i->first is greater than or equivalent to __k.
10:14:18 <Marvin-->     if (__i == end() || key_comp()(__k, (*__i).first))
10:14:18 <Marvin-->       __i = insert(__i, value_type(__k, _Tp()));
10:14:18 <Marvin-->     return (*__i).second;
10:14:20 <Marvin-->   }
10:14:22 <Marvin--> good thing that C++ isn't complicated :/
10:14:25 <pesco> Aahhh!
10:14:56 <Marvin--> (insert "aaarrrrgh, my eyes, my eyes!" here)
10:15:29 <Vincenz> yick
10:15:31 <Darius> One wouldn't typically mangle their own sourcecode.
10:15:34 <Vincenz> I hate complex c++ code
10:15:40 <Vincenz> I'm only good at basic c++
10:15:50 <Vincenz> Ocaml's great though!
10:15:56 <Vincenz> I love that it's not fully functional
10:15:57 <Marvin-->   friend bool operator< (const map<_K1, _T1, _C1, _A1>&,
10:15:58 <Marvin-->                          const map<_K1, _T1, _C1, _A1>&);
10:15:58 <Marvin--> good god
10:16:01 <Vincenz> cause passing the state sux
10:16:11 <Vincenz> (threading the state, iirc)
10:16:14 <Marvin--> Vincenz: *cough*monads*cough*
10:16:29 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I'm coming from a COMPLETELY non-fp background
10:16:43 <Marvin--> Vincenz: so did I first :)
10:16:43 <Vincenz> Java, C++, Assembly, Ada, Pascal, Basic, (Smalltalk)
10:16:47 <pesco> Hey, OT is ok, but IMPURITY is, let's say, not our favourite here!
10:16:52 <Vincenz> so cut me some slack
10:16:54 <pesco> ;)
10:16:55 <Marvin--> pesco: :)
10:17:08 * Vincenz nods at peco
10:17:28 <Vincenz> what's OT?
10:17:33 <pesco> Off-topic.
10:17:37 <Vincenz> ah
10:17:41 <Darius> The only "FP" (used loosely) language I used before Haskell was some Lisp/Scheme
10:17:50 <Vincenz> perhaps once I'm comfortable I'll step over to haskell
10:17:53 <Vincenz> but NEVER lisp/scheme
10:17:55 * Vincenz shivers
10:17:59 <Vincenz> typeless system
10:18:03 * Vincenz shivers
10:18:09 <Darius> Better typed than C/C++
10:18:13 <Darius> Just dynamic
10:18:20 <Vincenz> sorry I have am parenthesis-dyslexic
10:18:27 <Vincenz> s/have//g
10:18:55 <pesco> I like scheme, but LISP seems a bit strange to me.
10:18:57 <Vincenz> I don't know, I think a language should have some syntactic basis, and I feel lisps/schemes is way too slim
10:19:27 <Vincenz> I like ruby for example, but wouldn't do more than scripting with it, I think compile-time typechecking is a good thing
10:19:30 <Darius> You get used to it, it's actually not that bad. 
10:19:35 <Marvin--> Vincenz: actually, yes, McCarthy started with the abstract syntax and felt "eh, someone will make a decent frontend for this", but it never happened :)
10:19:41 <Darius> Vincenz: I do to
10:20:14 <Darius> Lispers love their program transformations, and Lisp's syntax makes it easy
10:20:18 <Vincenz> plus the fact that....and I know you'll throw back in my face (you can write unreadable code with any language)....the fact that you can pretty much redefine everything..
10:20:24 <Darius> It's much simpler than TH hacking
10:20:41 <Vincenz> makes you have to look up every single piece of code, I can read through Java code without checking all the classes for example
10:21:02 <Marvin--> Vincenz: I can't
10:21:04 <Darius> Ack! Not having operator overloading is one of the problems with Java IMO
10:21:19 <Vincenz> Darius: that is a topic I don't have an opinion on
10:21:29 <Marvin--> Darius: oh no, the extreme adhocness of the operator overloading in C++ is a problem IMO
10:21:34 <Marvin--> "hmm, what does this mean again?"
10:21:38 <Vincenz> but personally (except for all the extra stuff you have to do sometime to make something) i'm pretty fast at writing java code
10:21:49 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I used it for my smartpointer :P
10:22:17 <Vincenz> and it was ym first try ever, WOOT!
10:22:22 <Vincenz> operator->
10:23:04 <Vincenz> what I miss in Java though is the stuff you can do with Ocaml/Haskell, the fact you can easily write mathematically complex algorithms over complex-structures
10:23:13 <Vincenz> you can do it in java but it's a bitchload of code
10:23:29 <Vincenz> (with all the stupid stub-classes, etc..)
10:24:15 <Vincenz> so right now my three fave languages of choice: java-development, ruby-quick scripting (for FileIO/network), ocaml(haskell)-complex algorithms
10:24:39 <Vincenz> :)
10:24:47 <Darius> Typical static class-based OO languages have no support for small-scale reuse
10:24:58 <shapr> I like Haskell for two out of three there
10:25:05 <shapr> I haven't actually tried scripting with Haskell
10:25:08 <Vincenz> Darius: how do you mean?
10:25:14 <Vincenz> like java?
10:25:19 <Vincenz> for scripting?
10:25:22 <Vincenz> on the other hand
10:25:56 <Vincenz> dynamically typed languages (OO or not: Ruby/python/python), I personally don't feel they'd work great for large-scale devel, or you need really strict guidelines
10:25:58 <shapr> I enjoy using partial application to make 'instances'
10:26:27 <Darius> If you want some polymorphism or to override a method you need to make some class and interface etc.  In Haskell you just whip out a higher-order function.
10:26:30 <Vincenz> shapr: kind of like the module system in Ocaml?  (on a really skewed analogy: kind of like template code?)
10:26:40 <Vincenz> Darius: true
10:26:57 <shapr> the module system in OCaml gives you module specialization, right?
10:27:00 <Vincenz> but the code I've seen in haskell and ocaml has usually been written in hacker-style (you know, 1letter variables)
10:27:07 <Vincenz> shapr: yes I learned that today :)
10:27:22 <Darius> That's because it's so generic, what should the names in the fold function be?
10:27:31 <shapr> I was thinking more about filling in one argument for a function, and then using that in a map/foldr/etc
10:27:34 <Vincenz> Darius: true, but people tend to drag that over to functions too
10:27:47 <Darius> true
10:27:52 <Vincenz> I personally feel that large-scale devel is still best left to Java, unless you want to write complex algorithms
10:28:08 <shapr> I've written large programs in Java, and I don't like Java much at all.
10:28:21 <Marvin--> yes and no... the name of the function usually says a lot... If I have a function called transDecl, you can be pretty sure that variables called 'd' and 'ds' are declarations
10:28:33 <Vincenz> shapr: Java makes you write lots of code sometimes, but lately I've been able to add feature after feature with just three lines and a class wrapper
10:28:58 <Darius> Yeah, OO does extensibility really well
10:28:59 <Vincenz> Marvin--: Translator.translateDeclaration in Java, i still feel that's more readable..
10:29:10 <shapr> Vincenz: I would happily duel my Jython against your Java =)
10:29:17 <Vincenz> shapr: hehe :P
10:29:33 <Vincenz> the white-space blocking system scared me away in python
10:29:39 <Vincenz> and I was facing the decision: python vs ruby
10:29:45 <Vincenz> while ruby is smaller it's OO-wise REALLY clean
10:29:47 <shapr> in my experience, I've been able to write equivalent Jython programs in much much smaller amounts of code and time
10:29:59 <shapr> I prefer significant whitespace
10:30:00 <Vincenz> shapr: I can believe that
10:30:20 <Vincenz> shapr: the reason I haven't used it: I use java at work, I don't want to drag in more thirdparties
10:30:50 <tic> Python is really sweet
10:30:58 <shapr> have I already showed you my cool Jython screenshot? - http://kungens.kemi.fi/~shae/nokia-emu-jython.png
10:31:00 <tic> python really rocks if you want to code imperative
10:31:12 <Vincenz> so is Ruby, but I'd rather not write 1k code or more in it and wait till runtime to check if all my types are good
10:31:34 * Vincenz starts reading his 3rd ocaml book in pdf
10:31:36 <shapr> imho, you should never write 1k of code without running it
10:31:50 <psy> or testing it, or running it through pychecker.. :)
10:31:53 <shapr> I prefer test first
10:32:00 <shapr> test driven development
10:32:15 <Vincenz> shapr: I know what you mean
10:32:21 <Vincenz> shapr: I haven't stepped over to that yet
10:32:30 <Vincenz> and in java I can easily write > 1k code without testing without bugs
10:32:34 <tic> hehe
10:32:43 <tic> that's because you need to actually type 1k code to get something done :D
10:32:46 <Vincenz> plus you can't always test everying
10:32:50 <shapr> Vincenz: like what?
10:32:52 <Vincenz> gui
10:32:53 <Marvin--> I don't *need* to write 1k code in haskell
10:32:57 <shapr> I can test gui.
10:33:01 <Vincenz> network between gui and some third app
10:33:03 <Marvin--> there are gui testing frameworks afaik
10:33:09 <Darius> 1k Haskell ~10k C++/Java
10:33:14 <shapr> I've done gui testing with swing
10:33:18 <Marvin--> everything can be tested
10:33:19 <Vincenz> Darius: I know :)
10:33:24 <tic> heh
10:33:29 <tic> I've written the same app in both java and haskell
10:33:30 <Vincenz> I dunno
10:33:31 <Marvin--> as they say in XP, "If you can't test it, it doesn't exist"
10:33:37 <tic> a word-frequency analyzer with a binary tree implementatio
10:33:39 <shapr> Marvin--: yah, I agree.
10:33:40 <tic> implementation
10:33:43 <tic> wonder which one is the shortest.
10:33:55 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I don't think XP is a true style, but more a collection of pragmatic approaches
10:33:58 <Marvin--> "If you can't show the presence of a feature, it *does not exist*"
10:34:09 <Marvin--> Vincenz: so?
10:34:15 <Marvin--> if it works, it works
10:34:21 <tic> java: 286 rows
10:34:23 * shapr likes XP very much
10:34:25 <tic> s/rows/lines
10:34:28 <tic> haskell: 215
10:34:30 <Marvin--> 'course they're pragmatic, because you know what? they're pragmatic :)
10:34:33 <tic> so the java version isn't much smaller
10:34:36 <Marvin--> only purists care about purism ;)
10:34:42 <Vincenz> yes, but if I need to write twice as much code for the tests, just to check my typing instead of having compiler check my types...
10:34:44 <tic> of course, the java version doesn't include the actual implementation of a binary tree
10:34:52 <Marvin--> Vincenz: I'm not talking about types
10:35:02 <shapr> yah, types can be correct, and code can still be wrong
10:35:07 <Vincenz> this conversation started when I complained about dynamic typing
10:35:13 <Marvin--> oh
10:35:16 <Marvin--> well, it got out of hand :)
10:35:21 <shapr> I like dynamic typing.
10:35:30 <shapr> imho, Haskell has compile time dynamic typing =)
10:35:44 * Marvin-- wants Great Cleave so his fighter can go whack goblins on his own
10:35:47 <Vincenz> I just feel that having to write testcode for each little piece...is overkill
10:35:53 <shapr> Vincenz: I disagree
10:35:54 <Darius> I only like dynamic typing if I need it (a rare occurence in Haskell)
10:35:58 <Vincenz> plus!!
10:36:12 <shapr> I think that writing testcode for each little piece means I know that piece works.
10:36:20 <Vincenz> sometimes some functions expect these complex datastructures that actually setting up to test the method is more of a pain than anything
10:36:27 <shapr> in fact, I prefer writing QuickCheck tests, because then I *really* know it works.
10:36:36 <Vincenz> shapr: Humans have intelligence, we can prove certain things will work
10:36:38 <shapr> so use QuickCheck
10:36:42 <Marvin--> shapr: damn, discourage me, just go ahead :/
10:36:46 <Vincenz> shapr: your test case can ALWAYS miss testcases you didn't think of
10:36:47 <shapr> Vincenz: humans make lots of mistakes.
10:36:51 <shapr> Vincenz: so use quickcheck
10:36:55 <shapr> Marvin--: what? eh?
10:36:57 <Vincenz> quickechk?
10:36:57 <Darius> I would prefer a proof to testing if possible
10:37:01 <shapr> yah, me too
10:37:05 <Marvin--> shapr: if quickcheck already works, why is my master project needed? :)
10:37:06 <Vincenz> Darius: me too :P
10:37:11 <shapr> Marvin--: your project is *better*
10:37:21 <Marvin--> shapr: that remains to be seen
10:37:38 <shapr> even if you can only prove some parts of the code, I'll be thrilled
10:37:42 <shapr> I'll use it all the time :-)
10:37:55 <Vincenz> how about testing that a certain GUI component, when using drag and drop affects your underlying complex datamodel in the correct way
10:38:18 <Vincenz> how'd you test that?
10:38:19 <Darius> Isabelle/HOL looks nice but MLers are so stupid! I can't stand their backwards type constructors
10:38:25 <shapr> Vincenz: you fake known drag'n'drop events onto the component
10:38:44 <Marvin--> Darius: the problem with HOL proving is that it's very hard to automatically guesstimate the induction hypothesis
10:38:50 <Vincenz> shapr: in java that means a lot of code to create the correct types, which sometimes don't even have a constructor you can access
10:39:06 <Marvin--> Vincenz: that's Java's problem
10:39:15 <Vincenz> that's my problem with xp
10:39:24 <Marvin--> let me ammend my position to "everything can be tested unless you use crippled tools"
10:39:30 <Vincenz> lol
10:39:43 <Marvin--> insert a "bloody stupid" there somewhere too, if you like :-)
10:39:53 <Marvin--> sorry, I just don't believe in the "information hiding" thingy
10:39:58 <Vincenz> I do
10:39:59 <Marvin--> *sooner or later* someone *will* need it
10:40:10 <Vincenz> not if you deliver a package to another person/group
10:40:17 <Marvin--> C++ is even worse
10:40:19 <Vincenz> you want to assure they can't fuck up the assertions
10:40:20 <Marvin--> #define private public
10:40:37 <Marvin--> Vincenz: then you underestimate the creativity of true fools
10:40:42 <Vincenz> Marvin--: heh, you can do fucked up stuff in any language, but I agree, I hate c-preprocessor
10:41:09 <Marvin--> people *will* need the implementation, and so they say "bah, this sucks, let's fork it"
10:41:21 <Marvin--> then where's your reuse?
10:41:30 <Vincenz> inheritance
10:41:48 <Marvin--> .oO(I need to get this out of my system before the interviews so I don't badmouth their pretty minds :P)
10:41:57 <Vincenz> it's just that, waht if you create for example a tree.
10:42:02 <Vincenz> and you have smoe assumptions about that tree
10:42:08 <Vincenz> what would you think if the user started fucking up the tree?
10:42:30 <shapr> Vincenz: that's their problem
10:42:33 <Vincenz> no
10:42:41 <Vincenz> that's your problem cause they'll start whining to you
10:42:53 <Vincenz> you delivered, you make it work
10:43:23 <Marvin--> then *make* it work, if it doesn't work for your customer then it's not good enough
10:43:31 <shapr> I've used Python for ... I think seven years.
10:43:39 * Vincenz nods at shapr
10:43:48 <Vincenz> I don't know I guess it's a personal preference
10:43:56 <shapr> hiding has been a problem in Java code I've used
10:43:58 <Vincenz> personally I'm for implementation hiding
10:44:04 <tic> shapr, anything special about Jython?
10:44:09 <Vincenz> shapr: here too, but that's because of the bad design 
10:44:19 <Vincenz> JHotDraw and Swing hide certain things we should get access too
10:44:40 <Vincenz> fortunately I got the guys at Jhotdraw to change it :)
10:44:44 <shapr> many times I have needed to reach into a python instance or module to do something, as long as I knew I was going around the rules, I was aware that something might break.
10:44:58 <Marvin--> but that's partly what I'm saying, as a user, I want to be able to pick clean badly designed bones and use whatever I can
10:45:04 <shapr> for protected final Java classes, I just don't use them :-)
10:45:16 <Vincenz> Marvin--: that fucks up if you need to get a new version and your code crashes on it
10:45:17 <shapr> tic: well, Jython is 99% of CPython on top of the JVM.
10:45:39 <Marvin--> Vincenz: that's your own problem, you fork it, you deal with it
10:45:45 <shapr> any system that thinks it knows what I need is wrong.
10:45:50 <Marvin--> Vincenz: the point is that you can *make it work until the new version comes out*
10:45:56 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I'm afraid we're not going to get to a compromise here :P
10:45:58 <shapr> information hiding is part of knowing what I need.
10:46:10 <tic> shapr, okay. So why use Jython?
10:46:23 <Vincenz> tic: to use swing in a python way
10:46:26 <Vincenz> no?
10:46:34 <tic> hm
10:46:37 <shapr> tic: because some people pay me to write Java, and I can beat the prices of all my competitors with Jython =)
10:46:45 <tic> hehehe :)
10:46:46 <tic> okay
10:46:46 <Marvin--> Vincenz: what I'm saying is that people don't churn out new versions every week to fix minor bugs, so I need to work around things in the mean time. Period. Open source solves this, for which I'm glad
10:46:50 <shapr> hi _Codex, are you related to esap?
10:46:59 <_Codex> shapr: sure.
10:47:00 <tic> shapr, how does import work?  import os.path; import javax.swing.*; ?
10:47:10 <Vincenz> Marvin--: I dunno, at the company I'm being a consultant at now they don't think that way
10:47:15 <shapr> tic: import javax
10:47:32 <shapr> tic: then you can refer to anything under javax
10:47:40 <Vincenz> shapr: you work for yourself?
10:47:43 <shapr> Vincenz: sure
10:47:56 <Vincenz> I mean, you have your own 1-person company?
10:47:58 <shapr> yes
10:48:04 <tic> shapr, neat.
10:48:05 <Vincenz> neat
10:48:10 <shapr> and I also have a three person company as well.
10:48:10 <Vincenz> isn't that...hmm..stressy?
10:48:16 <shapr> Vincenz: no, it's totally the opposite
10:48:17 <tic> shapr, but you don't really write Java code now, do you? :)
10:48:21 <shapr> tic: yes, I really do.
10:48:24 <Vincenz> shapr: in case you can't get contracts..
10:48:30 <shapr> Vincenz: I have lots of contracts.
10:48:33 <tic> shapr, but isn't Jython _python_ ?
10:48:35 <shapr> I just got a big one today =)
10:48:43 <Marvin--> I got my tax forms today, I think I need a whisky :/
10:48:48 <Marvin--> damn them, sending out tax forms on April 1st
10:48:52 <Vincenz> shapr: if my application for a doctorate blows, I'm writing one to you:P
10:48:54 <shapr> tic: it compiles to either Java source, or Java classes
10:48:59 <shapr> Vincenz: heheh
10:49:02 <tic> shapr, ohh! sweet :)
10:49:04 <shapr> Vincenz: can you do Haskell? =)
10:49:14 <Vincenz> shapr: give me a month and yes
10:49:15 <tic> shapr, so they'll never know you're writing it in Java.  
10:49:17 <Vincenz> I learn pretty fas
10:49:20 <Vincenz> I learned ruby in 2 days
10:49:33 <tic> shapr, damnit, wish I knew that before writing the fugly binary search tree assignment in Java :P
10:49:58 <shapr> tic: if you clients want maintainable Java sources, the only way is to prototype it in Jython and then port it to Java
10:50:14 <shapr> java sources from Jython are scary looking.
10:50:21 <Vincenz> shapr: hehe
10:50:25 <tic> shapr, hehe, okay.
10:50:26 <shapr> and they require the 175k jython lib jar file.
10:50:35 <shapr> hi vardamir 
10:50:40 <Vincenz> shapr: that's not that big :P
10:50:52 <shapr> it's pretty big for an applet.
10:51:00 <Vincenz> ah, true
10:51:05 <vardamir> hey
10:51:08 <Marvin--> yay, I'm getting *drumroll* 16 SEK back this year :P
10:51:28 <tic> wow!
10:51:36 <shapr> oh, the latest jython jar is now 718k
10:51:38 <tic> I'm getting, uhm, 1k4 sek this year :)
10:51:43 <shapr> still smaller than the VB runtime
10:52:17 <Marvin--> hey cool, they've simplified the forms *again* so now I have to learn this all over
10:52:24 <Vincenz> Marvin--: hehe
10:52:30 <Vincenz> tic: how much is a sek?
10:52:35 * Vincenz earns a standard low far :(
10:52:44 <shapr> vardamir: want to learn Haskell?
10:52:58 <Marvin--> Vincenz: 9-10 SEK is approximately one euro
10:53:00 <shapr> _Codex: are you esap's brother?
10:53:20 <Vincenz> so..1k4 is?
10:53:23 <Vincenz> that's an odd syntax
10:53:41 <Marvin--> k as in kilo :P 1400
10:53:44 <esap> shapr: yes he is.
10:53:48 <shapr> cool :-)
10:54:00 <Vincenz> 140 euro for a year?
10:54:14 <vardamir> i'm trying to understand functional programming, and i don't see why it is that foldr can evaluate infinite lists while foldl can't.  To me it seems that it should be the other way around since foldl would do f(initial, list[0]) for it's first evaluation, whereas foldr would do f(list[infinite], initial)
10:54:22 <vardamir> i'm just not seeing something right
10:54:33 <Marvin--> ugh, I always hate looking at the balance
10:54:42 <shapr> vardamir: foldr is "fold from the left to the right"
10:54:56 <Marvin--> Centrala studiestödsnämnden    - 165108
10:54:58 * Marvin-- sighs
10:55:26 <Darius> foldr f == a `f` (b `f` (c `f` e))
10:55:30 <debug> Marvin--: that's not very much, is it?
10:55:44 <Marvin--> pretty standard for three and a half years I guess
10:55:48 <debug> ok
10:55:57 * debug forgot: csn changed the rules a few years ago
10:56:00 * Vincenz earns 1450 euro/month after taxes :(
10:57:20 <pesco> byebye, I have to go
10:57:24 <shapr> cya pesco 
10:57:27 <Vincenz> bye pesco
10:57:34 <vardamir> alright, i think i see it, thanks
10:57:46 <pesco> I'll be back as soon as GHC 5 runs... ;-)
10:58:19 <shapr> vardamir: xu do tavla fo la lojban
10:58:31 <Vincenz> non ci capisco un cazzo
10:58:49 <shapr> ik ben een buitenlander!
10:58:54 <tic> heh
10:59:06 <tic> I have like... 800 euro a month. :)
10:59:06 <Vincenz> shapr: inderdaad, maar dat was italiaans, niet nederlands
10:59:17 <shapr> Vincenz: oui, je sais :-)
10:59:28 <tic> ja nie rozumiem!
10:59:31 <Vincenz> tic: well I should be getting more, I'm a MS in EE
10:59:35 <shapr> men jag kan inte tala italiansk
10:59:46 <tic> Vincenz, ah.
10:59:50 <Vincenz> I still want to learn spanish
11:00:06 <Vincenz> and haskell and ocaml
11:00:07 <Vincenz> :P
11:00:11 <shapr> good idea :-)
11:00:32 <Vincenz> ocaml first tho, as I'm already halfway there
11:00:37 <shapr> yah, go for it.
11:00:44 <Vincenz> shapr: how would you do streams in haskell?
11:00:47 <Vincenz> since streams are mutables
11:00:56 <shapr> use a monad?
11:01:18 <shapr> or Control.Concurrent.Chan
11:01:28 <shapr> wait, why are streams mutable?
11:01:33 <Vincenz> well because
11:01:39 <Vincenz> if you parse a certain amount
11:01:46 <Vincenz> and you parse again, that amount isn't there anymore
11:01:48 <Vincenz> like...
11:01:56 <shapr> oh, I'd use a monad.
11:02:18 <shapr> vardamir: did that answer help any?
11:02:59 <shapr> Vincenz: monads give you the best of both world, purely functional code and side-effects at the same time.
11:03:11 <shapr> er, maybe that should be the best of the #World
11:03:22 <Vincenz> monads instead of lessnads?
11:03:24 * shapr assumes the World is unpacked
11:03:30 * Vincenz curses at his own crappy humor
11:03:36 <Darius> I think the RealWorld is
11:04:01 <tic> real world? what's that?
11:04:03 <tic> I've heard of it
11:04:14 <shapr> tic: you only get that if you spend less time on irc.
11:04:25 <tic> feh
11:04:31 <_Codex> I dont still see why stream needs to be mutable? Cant you think it as constants, which you dont know yet?
11:04:44 <Vincenz> tic: it appears there's this big yellow thing in the sky that sends millions of ippackets that cause collision, heating your skin
11:04:48 <shapr> _Codex: what about readLn ?
11:04:59 <emu> anyone heard about the new Gonad support for Haskell?
11:05:02 <Vincenz> _Codex: well, you read...you read again, you're not supposed to read the same thing
11:05:21 <tic> Vincenz, ohhh
11:05:39 <shapr> emu: what about tribes of monadic grad students roaming the campus?
11:05:43 <Darius> Streams as a single value, that value being an infinite list
11:05:58 <shapr> I think FP languages used to do that.
11:06:00 <Darius> Old school FP IO handling
11:06:04 <shapr> yah
11:07:00 <emu> shapr: they were affected by campus police
11:07:26 * shapr snickers
11:08:45 <_Codex> vincenz: so, for something to be a stream, it has to lose the previous information before reading new elements?
11:08:59 <Vincenz> sort of yeah
11:18:08 <esap> Hmm.. can I encapsulate an universally quantified type variable inside an algebraic data type in GHC's existential quantification extension?
11:19:23 <Darius> GHC doesn't have existential quantification, it has rank-k types that are 'nearly' isomorphic, but yes.
11:20:36 <esap> How is it done. Because I would assume that using that kind of quantification, those type variables would be able to "escape" the existential quantification.
11:21:10 <Darius> They can and it's erroneous.  GHC catches at type checking
11:21:54 <esap> No no, I mean I would assume that case would _not_ be erroneous. The ordinary escaping would be clearly an error (because it's existential and not universal quantification).
11:22:24 <esap> But the case where you would encapsulate an universal quantification inside the existential scope would not.
11:23:20 <esap> Ok, your point about rank-k types vs. existential quantification might actually change this, I need to look more closely on that.
11:23:33 <Riastradh> Hi.
11:24:41 <shapr> hey Riastradh 
11:24:55 <shapr> Riastradh: you're now a developer on haskell-libs
11:25:00 <shapr> you got da powah
11:25:21 <Riastradh> shapr - Yes, I read up.
11:25:30 <Riastradh> Now I'm trying to get my modules working.
11:25:34 <shapr> have you been able to compile lambdabot?
11:25:45 <Riastradh> Yes.
11:25:48 <shapr> yay
11:26:02 <shapr> any questions about lambdabot?
11:26:45 <Riastradh> Nope, not at the moment.
11:26:50 <shapr> ok
11:27:10 <Riastradh> I find it a tad harder than I think it should be to use a finite map in a module's state, though.
11:27:45 <shapr> I haven't tried putting an FM into ModuleState, is it convoluted?
11:28:02 <Riastradh> Apparently finite maps don't have a 'Typeable' instance.
11:28:06 <shapr> oh
11:28:19 <shapr> how are you doing it then?
11:28:24 <shapr> saving it as a list?
11:28:36 <Riastradh> Er...could I just define an instance of Typeable for FiniteMaps?
11:28:42 <Darius> Yes
11:28:45 <Riastradh> Curses.
11:29:09 <shapr> what does an instance of Typeable involve?
11:29:19 <Riastradh> The way I'm doing it now is with a 'KarmaState' instance as a layer of indirection, which Pseudonym suggested, and adding a FiniteMap instance to Typeable only just occurred to me.
11:31:17 <Darius> instance Typeable (FiniteMap key value) where typeOf _ = mkAppTy finiteMapTyCon [typeOf (undefined :: key), typeOf (undefined ::value)]
11:31:55 <shapr> yay
11:32:03 <shapr> lambdabot: yay!
11:32:03 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
11:32:06 <shapr> lambdabot: @fact yay!
11:32:07 <lambdabot> shapr is so predictable
11:33:04 <Darius> lambdabot: @fact bounce
11:33:05 <lambdabot> Nothing
11:33:21 * shapr grins
11:33:24 <Riastradh> Where is 'finiteMapTyCon' defined?
11:34:12 <Darius> finiteMapTyCon = mkTyCon "FiniteMap"      {-# NOINLINE finiteMapTyCon #-}
11:34:28 <Darius> Just don't stick the mkTyCon in the typeOf function
11:35:52 <Marvin--> http://www.agameofthrones.com/photo.php4?id=290  uhm... riiiiiight
11:36:17 <Riastradh> Er, it doesn't like the {-# NOINLINE .. #-} bit.
11:37:53 <Darius> ? It shouldn't have a problem with that.  You can try it without.
11:38:50 <shapr> Riastradh: since you asked, I put build instructions into the README
11:39:59 <Darius> It may (though I doubt it) need to go on it's own line or before finiteMapTyCon.
11:40:19 <shapr> Riastradh: I think I'll go for a 1.0 release when your plugin is checked in and happy.
11:40:30 <Riastradh> shapr - Didn't you already release 1.0?
11:40:35 <shapr> no, not yet.
11:41:22 <Riastradh> Oh, and also, I added some code for module initialisation -- the Module typeclass now has a new method, moduleInit, which I added to the StateModule, too.
11:41:37 <shapr> oh, I just added init
11:42:20 <shapr> I like yours, go for it :-)
11:42:46 * shapr goes off to watch TV for a bit.
11:42:48 <shapr> bbs
11:43:21 <Riastradh> 'init' was already taken in GHC.List, so I chose 'moduleInit.'
11:43:27 <shapr> oh, good point
11:44:45 <esap> Hmm.. here's another interesting question: how come rank-k types seem to cause $ to behave differently from function application [$ will produce an error, function application works]
11:45:50 <Riastradh> Darius - Now it's complaining about:  Could not deduce (Typeable elt, Typeable key) from the context (Typeable (FiniteMap key, elt))
11:46:02 <Darius> Er add that to the context
11:46:20 <Darius> of the instance
11:46:39 <Riastradh> instance (Typeable elt, Typeable key) => (FiniteMap key elt) where ...
11:46:42 <Riastradh> That?
11:47:09 <Darius> instance (Typeable elt, Typeable key) => Typaeable (FiniteMap key elt) where ...
11:47:13 <Riastradh> Ah, ok.
11:47:59 <Darius> Of course, that means for FiniteMap a b to be Typeable a and b need to be, so whatever types you are sticking into the FiniteMap need to be instances of Typeable
11:48:16 <Riastradh> Strings and Integers are both Typeable, right?
11:48:27 <Darius> yes
11:48:56 <Darius> esap: assuming f x, what is the type of f and x?
11:51:35 <esap> darius: f :: Monad m => Pattern a b -> a -> m b   , x :: Pattern a b. Pattern a b is a synonym: type Pattern a b = (Monad m) => Kleisli m a b
11:52:51 <esap> darius: it is really quite complicated situation.
11:56:46 <pesco> grmpf, what is __eprintf?!
12:05:30 <Darius> In a nutshell $ isn't polymorphic enough, it'd have to have a type scheme for a type as (f $) :: (Monad m) => (forall m'. a -> m' b) -> a -> m b (approx)
12:06:46 <esap> darius: Ok, so I just need to make another version of $ :-)
12:07:52 <esap> darius: anyway, it's interesting, I thought $ was very much substitutable for function application.
12:15:44 <Marvin--> eh? what are you talking about?
12:16:30 <esap> I have a situation where function application works but the same using ($) does not.
12:18:06 <Marvin--> cool
12:18:53 <Marvin--> I don't quite understand how  forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b  can fail to be general enough, though
12:21:03 <esap> here's a simpler variant of the problem: mapPat :: >mapPat :: Monad m => (Pattern a b -> Pattern c d) -> (forall n. Monad n => a -> n b) -> c -> m d , mapPat trans pat = runP (trans (liftP pat)), with runP :: Monad m => Pattern a b -> a -> m b, liftP :: (forall m. Monad m => a -> m b) -> Pattern a b, type Pattern a b = (Monad m) => Kleisli m a b, newtype Kleisli m a b = K (a -> m b). Try make runP application use $
12:22:10 <Marvin--> ah, so $ fails to work with higher order types
12:22:18 <esap> yes, basically.
12:23:36 <Marvin--> type Pattern a b = (Monad m) => Kleisli m a b  is scary
12:24:13 <esap> heh, true. I'm just experimenting on the type system...
12:24:28 <Marvin--> but take the runP type... runP :: Monad m => Pattern a b -> a -> m b
12:24:35 <Marvin--> no wait, never mind
12:24:50 <esap> runP (K p) x = p x
12:25:40 <Marvin--> yes
12:25:43 <esap> it type checks, I'm actually surprised :-)
12:26:44 <Marvin--> yes, I guess the fact that it type checks is what causes problems for $ ;)
12:28:01 <Marvin--> but the type Pattern actually has an implicit  forall m.
12:28:13 <Marvin--> so liftP is quite okay... runP is scarier
12:29:56 <Marvin--> but the point is that since the embedded function works for *any* monad, it works for the monad we return
12:30:16 <esap> yes, that is the idea.
12:30:27 <Marvin--> so for example, liftP return works, but not liftP Just
12:30:46 <Marvin--> it's like the fold/build trickery
12:32:11 <esap> What I'm actually aiming is that this Pattern thing is supposed to generalize some pattern matching constructs I've done for the Maybe monad for arbitrary monad.
12:32:29 <Marvin--> esap: for extra fun, try  mapPat trans pat = ?f runP (trans (liftP pat))
12:32:34 <Marvin--> (i.e. an implicit parameter f)
12:33:03 <Marvin--> it won't type-check either
12:33:17 <esap> very interesting.
12:34:33 <Marvin--> I think that's the same error as for $, isn't it?
12:34:37 <esap> yes.
12:34:55 <esap> "inferred type is less polymorphic than expected", 'm' escapes.
12:38:21 <Darius> Basically, you have to package everything you want to do to a local type variable with it (the most convenient way to do that is with a type class)
12:41:19 <Marvin--> I reiterate, higher order types give me headache :)
12:41:52 <Marvin--> yay, I crashed /-bot
12:42:05 * Marvin-- taunts shapr
12:43:51 <andersca> \
12:43:54 <andersca> /\
12:47:41 <Marvin--> you might even say that these things give me higher-order headaches :/
12:48:24 <mgoetze> eh? why is there no libqt3 available here?
12:49:19 <Marvin--> in #haskell? well, let me see...
12:49:33 <mgoetze> i mean, on corelli.mgoetze.net
12:52:10 <vardamir> you guys probably know this, but apparently the sieve of Eratosthenes implemented in haskell for ghc came in 2nd under gcc (and above g++) for speed and memory usage!
12:52:30 <vardamir> http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/bench/sieve/
12:52:31 <Marvin--> I'm not the least surprised
12:53:01 <Marvin--> and you know what, that's a very slow implementation :)
12:54:07 <vardamir> this is my first day of haskell; i still don't understand all the syntax yet ;)  also, looks like it was tied for least lines of code
12:54:13 <Marvin--> php and the awks are hideously slow
12:54:42 <mgoetze> i bet my sieve is better than whatever he used :P
12:55:08 <Marvin--> the python version would be waaaay faster if the inner xrange object was created statically
12:56:33 <mgoetze> yup, it looks less optimized than my sieve
12:56:39 <Marvin--> "Languages that compile to native code are in Bold Italics." so why is java in bold italic?
12:56:50 <Marvin--> interesting that uncompiled erlang was faster than perl :)
12:57:29 <vardamir> maybe they used gcc's java compiler or something
12:57:57 <Marvin--> isn't that one called gcj?
12:58:23 <Marvin--> says sieve.class in the log
12:59:08 <vardamir> yeah, i think so.  Hmm, who knows.
12:59:26 <Marvin--> interesting that the java version really really didn't scale
12:59:44 <Marvin--> I would expect a lot of Java's running time to be for loading
12:59:52 <Darius> and memory?
13:00:23 <emu> he compensated for loading time
13:00:24 <emu> i think
13:00:39 <Marvin--> oh
13:03:37 <Marvin--> uhm, am I the only one who think that the sieve will only be computed once?
13:03:42 <Marvin--> and that's what it looks like in the stats too
13:12:55 <vardamir> mgoetze, can you send me your sieve (if you don't mind) so I can take a look at a different implementation?
13:13:30 <mgoetze> i think i put it at http://www.mgoetze.net/~mgoetze/prime.hs
13:14:48 <vardamir> thanks
13:15:02 <mgoetze> np
13:24:59 <andersca> apparently the scheme code isn't very good either
13:30:33 <emu> who cares about these silyl languages like haskell, scheme, ml, lisp.   C is the only language you need to know.  and Java.  now disperese and go get "Learn to porgram in 21 Days in C++"
13:31:26 <tic> he
13:31:28 <tic> heh
13:31:42 * tic caresses Python (on the imperative side)
13:32:21 <Marvin--> good god, e-mail is a mess
13:32:40 <emu> fucking commie pinko Python users
13:32:49 <vardamir> At first i thought i was blessed that my university used C++ instead of Java to teach CS.  However, I decided to write quicksort for a dynamic array ... this changed my mind, especially after my CS prof showed me quicksort in Haskell (which was the first time I saw it).
13:32:51 <emu> You must code EVERYTHING in C
13:33:02 <tic> Nobody in here would know where to buy a subbed/dubbed version of "Spartakus and The Sun Beneath The Sea" (orig: "Les Mondes Englitous")
13:33:32 <vardamir> it being haskell
13:33:57 <emu> C++ instead of Java? yikes
13:34:06 <emu> GC is the greatest boon to a student
13:34:09 <emu> fuck +C+
13:34:12 <emu> use ++C
13:34:20 <Marvin--> use C-- :)
13:34:28 <emu> yes, it will even support GC soon
13:35:58 * Marvin-- swears at the e-mail reply-to/m-f-t/m-r-t mess
13:50:55 --- mode: ChanServ set +o SyntaxPolice
13:56:53 * shapr figures out how Marvin-- crashed lambdabot
13:57:32 * andersca boings
13:58:27 * shapr bounces
13:58:29 <shapr> y0 andersca 
13:58:30 <shapr> wassup?
13:59:17 <shapr> hey, we have an op on the channel
13:59:17 <shapr> w00
14:00:29 <mgoetze> we do? indeed... but why?
14:00:58 * shapr dunno
14:01:06 <tic> hm..
14:01:07 <tic> sleep?
14:01:08 <tic> I'm restless
14:01:15 <vardamir> hmm, i wonder how long it will take my PIII to multiply 2 4 million digit numbers
14:01:36 <Marvin--> shapr: :)
14:01:37 <shapr> vardamir: could be very short if it all zeroes ending with a 1
14:01:50 <shapr> now of course, I have to fix the bug that Marvin-- found
14:01:51 <Darius> or just all zeros
14:01:52 <vardamir> unfortunately one of them is a prime
14:02:11 <shapr> 1 is a prime
14:02:14 <vardamir> and not 1 (if you consider 1 a prime)
14:02:19 <shapr> ok, what about 2?
14:02:21 <Marvin--> shapr: what was it?
14:02:26 <Darius> shl 1
14:02:35 <Marvin--> 1 is not a prime
14:02:47 <vardamir> Prelude> (2^13466917-1)*2^13466916
14:02:48 <shapr> Marvin--: the offensive fortunes directory, my code tried to treat it like any other fortune file.
14:02:53 <Marvin--> shapr: heh
14:03:46 <Marvin--> shapr: what are they, xor:ed? rot13:ed?
14:03:56 <shapr> rot13 I think
14:04:46 <shapr> is there something like isDirectory ?
14:05:20 <Marvin--> probably in posix
14:05:27 * shapr finds the word "lucky" in the GHC Haddocks
14:06:47 <Marvin--> -package unix, import System.Posix.Files  or something
14:06:48 <shapr> aha
14:07:06 <shapr> GHC.Posix has filetype
14:07:34 <Marvin--> even better
14:09:08 <Marvin--> "socialpornografisk tv4-dokumentär" hahahaha
14:09:22 <shapr> eh?
14:09:49 <Marvin--> sorry, I don't know how to translate it :)
14:10:04 <shapr> social pornography? 
14:10:39 <Marvin--> something like that
14:10:43 <Marvin--> dokumentär = documentary
14:10:55 * shapr is afraid to ask
14:12:05 <Marvin--> don't, I don't know how to explain :)
14:12:21 <shapr> ok
14:13:03 <mgoetze> a social form of pornography, or a pornographic look at society?
14:13:20 <Marvin--> "pornographic" is pretty liberally used in this context :)
14:13:24 <Marvin--> more like "selling" :)
14:13:42 <Marvin--> shapr: if you want to see a good Swedish movie btw, see Fucking Åmål
14:14:08 <andersca> or sällskapsresan
14:14:24 <Marvin--> not quite the same thing :)
14:14:38 <shapr> I'll just hang around here for a few years...
14:14:49 <shapr> ( assuming migrationsverket agrees )
14:14:55 <shapr> and then maybe I'll understand.
14:15:02 <shapr> my green card interview today was very strange
14:15:18 <Marvin--> it was a story about movies about youths
14:15:19 <Marvin--> oh
14:15:20 <Marvin--> ?
14:15:24 <shapr> it seems there's never been a case like mine.
14:15:36 * Riastradh sploofs.
14:15:44 <Marvin--> what's so special about your case?
14:16:06 <Smerdyakov> So immensely obese
14:16:13 <shapr> Marvin--: I have EEA citizen rights from .fi but sweden interprets the EU rules differently.
14:16:23 <Marvin--> oh, interesting
14:16:24 <shapr> Smerdyakov: stop talking about my briefcase that way, you might hurt its feelings.
14:16:58 <Marvin--> not that I know what EEA is
14:17:05 <shapr> european economic area
14:17:20 <shapr> you know how you can freely travel in the EU without needing a passport, etc.. yah?
14:17:43 <shapr> that's part of the EEA citizen thing.
14:18:08 <Marvin--> okay
14:18:26 <shapr> I've hit a Gödel bug in the system.
14:18:40 <andersca> when I travelled back from brussels to göteborg I didn't have to show my passport at all
14:18:42 <andersca> that was kinda neat
14:19:17 <Marvin--> when we went home from Holland a few years ago, we had to show passports on the German-Danish border *mutter*
14:19:25 <shapr> so after months of discussion ( they even translated the finnish laws to swedish and compared them ) I get a one year permit, as if I were applying by myself.
14:19:31 <Marvin--> and that was at fucking midnight or something
14:19:40 <shapr> heh :-)
14:19:40 <Marvin--> hahaha
14:21:04 <Marvin--> "A jump-kick says more than 1000 words"
14:21:10 <Marvin--> (review of Hero)
14:21:45 <andersca> when I was at cern we had to show the passport when driving to france
14:22:15 <shapr> I tried to get a stamp in my passport when we went to germany.
14:22:23 <shapr> they didn't have any stamps :-(
14:22:43 <shapr> I'm an American from the Deep South. We think passport stamps are high society.
14:23:23 <andersca> I've never had a stamp in my passport
14:24:01 <Marvin--> me neither
14:24:24 <andersca> my keyboard is in köln...
14:26:23 <Marvin--> "In these days, Jeremy Irons was big, he didn't have to do crap like Dungeons & Dragons like today"
14:27:33 <Vincenz> anyone ever written a wiki in ocaml or haskell?
14:27:39 <shapr> crap, it's blowing up
14:27:48 <shapr> Vincenz: I'd like to write a wiki in haskell
14:27:56 <andersca> will you call it funki
14:27:57 <shapr> o3 is planning to do one for his masters' project
14:28:03 <shapr> andersca: brilliant name!
14:28:08 <shapr> marvelous!
14:28:08 <Vincenz> funki hehe
14:28:20 <Vincenz> but then ocaml can't write one
14:28:22 <Vincenz> or haski
14:28:48 <shapr> strange, it blows up with no such file or dir
14:28:52 <Marvin--> ocaml can care theirs impurefunki
14:28:56 * shapr laughs
14:28:59 <Marvin--> s/care/call/
14:29:04 <andersca> haha
14:29:22 * Vincenz slaps Marvin-- accross the face with a large recursive function
14:29:47 <Marvin--> ouch (ouch (ouch (ouch ...
14:29:49 <Vincenz> I bet the tail hurts the most
14:29:50 <Marvin--> no wait, that was lisp
14:29:54 * shapr laughs more
14:30:01 <andersca> ["ouch","ouch","ouch",... then
14:30:03 <Marvin--> recursive functions with WET TAILS
14:30:10 * shapr snickers
14:30:12 <Marvin--> WET TWISTED TAILS
14:30:19 <Vincenz> hey that's not fair
14:30:33 <Vincenz> haskell's lazy so you only get slapped once
14:30:35 * Vincenz mutters
14:30:44 <Marvin--> *g*
14:31:01 <Marvin--> and not until it's absolutely needed :P
14:31:11 <shapr> ah, the humor on this channel lifts me to a higher plane
14:31:13 <Vincenz> well this time it was absolutely needed :P
14:31:17 * Vincenz grins at shapr
14:31:20 <shapr> liftIO probaly
14:31:44 <shapr> shapr::IRC()
14:31:47 <Vincenz> how does laziness go in hand with optimisations though/
14:31:52 <Marvin--> the quotes book closes in five minutes, as I'm off to bed ;)
14:31:57 <shapr> Vincenz: you don't do it unless you have to.
14:32:02 <Vincenz> hehe
14:32:06 * shapr grins
14:32:12 <Vincenz> no but seriously, how can you optimize a program if you don't know what's going on
14:32:23 <shapr> I have to go to sleep too
14:32:25 <Marvin--> it's still *predictable*
14:32:31 <Vincenz> so I guess Haskell is the embodiement of YAGNI
14:32:33 <shapr> gotta go back to the migrationsverket tomorra morning
14:32:37 <shapr> Vincenz: yes! exactly!
14:32:40 <Marvin--> it's not like it's call-by-random-need
14:32:57 <Vincenz> Marvin--: it doesn't facilitate analysis though
14:33:11 <Marvin--> sure it does, it's just more complicated
14:33:14 * Vincenz once saw a picture of a fibonacci running after it's own tail...took me a while to get it
14:33:22 <Marvin--> yeah, that one's scary
14:33:31 <shapr> lazy list fibonacci is just a bunch of Vs
14:33:32 <Vincenz> I think the drawing is messed up
14:33:40 <shapr> stuck in sequence
14:33:40 <Marvin--> "Run, fibonacci, run! See fibonacci run!"
14:33:41 <Darius> then theirs rep_min or packrat parsers
14:33:49 <Darius> er there's
14:33:49 <shapr> Darius: what're those?
14:33:53 <Vincenz> hehe, shapr, remember me trying to implement it "Why won't it work?!?"
14:34:03 <shapr> Vincenz: yes, you've progressed quickly!
14:34:04 <shapr> yay!
14:34:19 <Vincenz> I haven't coded much haskell since :/
14:34:25 <shapr> there's still time!
14:34:27 <Marvin--> well, I'm off to bed
14:34:31 <Vincenz> mostly learning ocaml, but don't worry, I'll get there
14:34:31 <shapr> g'nite Marvin-- 
14:34:37 <shapr> Vincenz: sure, sounds good.
14:34:41 <Darius> data Tree = Leaf Int | Branch Tree Tree
14:35:00 <Vincenz> Darius: that's ocaml
14:35:06 <shapr> it's Haskell also.
14:35:09 <Vincenz> hmm...
14:35:14 <Vincenz> but I've seen people do this more often:
14:35:16 <Darius> what's coming up isn't OCaml
14:35:27 <shapr> Darius: lunch maybe?
14:35:29 <Vincenz> data Tree = Leaf | Branche Tree, int, Tree
14:35:32 <Vincenz> or something to that extent
14:35:40 <Darius> That ain't Haskell
14:35:40 <shapr> :-)
14:35:43 <Vincenz> using Leafs for empties (meaning a lot of redundant leafs)
14:36:22 <Darius> What's the difference between Leaf and C/C++'s NULL?  It's just a distinguished symbol
14:36:31 <Vincenz> type a btree =
14:36:31 <Vincenz> Node of a * a btree * a btree
14:36:31 <Vincenz> | Leaf;;
14:36:38 <Vincenz> there we go
14:36:45 <Igloo> It reduces the distance to the values though (on average, not worst case)
14:36:51 <Vincenz> Darius: yes, but wouldn't it be better to give the Leafs values though?
14:36:57 <Vincenz> that way you have less elements..
14:37:02 <shapr> yah, Algorithms book has data Tree a = Empty | Tree a Tree
14:37:08 <shapr> lets you build a tree of any flavor
14:37:15 <Darius> Depends on the use
14:37:31 <Vincenz> hmm, I also read about red-black trees in that pdf
14:37:40 <Vincenz> is that the standard way of balancing trees?
14:38:00 <Vincenz> I remember way back when in first year of college...we didn't use red-black trees for balancing...
14:38:50 <Vincenz> hm, on a sidenote, anyone got a good pdf on haskell?  I've check www.haskell.org, but most of the dox are compiler specific things..
14:39:20 <shapr> check the learninghaskell page in the topic
14:39:20 <Darius> There's a sizeable tutorial that's partially completed
14:39:53 <Vincenz> where at?
14:40:07 <Vincenz> http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/ ?
14:40:58 <Darius> http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/tutorial.pdf
14:41:11 <Vincenz> thnx
14:41:12 <Darius> from http://www.haskell.org/bookshelf/
14:41:29 <Vincenz> now all I need is a good example project to try out what I learned :P
14:41:32 <Igloo> For learning Haskell you want vim and hugs, not a pdf though  :-)
14:41:33 <Darius> I think that's the one I'm thinking of
14:41:40 <shapr> that's YAHT
14:41:49 <shapr> Yet Another Haskell Tutorial
14:41:49 <shapr> it's nice
14:41:54 * andersca ponders ordering haskell merchandise
14:41:56 <shapr> I wish I still had cvs privs for it
14:42:00 <shapr> andersca: ooo, like what?
14:42:04 <andersca> shapr: t-shirt
14:42:11 <shapr> good idea
14:42:17 <Vincenz> I'm lazy...just like haskell
14:42:34 <Vincenz> would make a great tshirt for solliciting :P
14:42:40 <shapr> sadly, I don't know anyone IRL who would recognize the symbol.
14:42:57 <Vincenz> Haskell: Just don't do it
14:43:07 <shapr> no no
14:43:08 <Vincenz> (Nike..)
14:43:13 <shapr> Haskell: Why force it?
14:43:16 <Vincenz> hmm
14:43:32 <Smerdyakov> Vincenz wins.
14:43:35 <Igloo> Someone should make t-shirts with amusing FP/Haskell on
14:43:43 <Igloo> But I dunno what  :-)
14:43:44 <shapr> Smerdyakov: just because you like SML :-P
14:43:55 <andersca> shapr: lambda is a gay/lesbian symbol

14:44:38 <Vincenz> for learning haskell and ocaml
14:44:51 <shapr> Vincenz: write a lambdabot plugin!
14:44:56 <Igloo> Ah, that'd be cool if it could be printed in a small enough font that it fitted
14:44:57 <shapr> it's fun! it's easy!
14:45:03 <Vincenz> alrighty!
14:45:08 <Smerdyakov> Isn't there any software you wish existed so you can use it, Vincenz?
14:45:10 <Vincenz> link to the sources?
14:45:10 <shapr> Igloo: it could be, I'm sure. 2 point type okay? =)
14:45:14 <Vincenz> Lambdaq: where are you?
14:45:22 <Vincenz> Smerdyakov: I said a -pet- project :P

14:45:33 <Igloo> I doubt you can get that small on a T-shirt  :-/
14:45:35 <Smerdyakov> Vincenz, your point...?
14:45:53 <Vincenz> Smerdyakov: touche
14:46:07 <shapr> Igloo: if you can find a good graphical description of HM, I'll get some T-Shirts printed.
14:46:08 <Vincenz> I'm bad with coming up with project ideas
14:46:44 <Igloo> Oh, I'm not sure I'd want a graphical one
14:46:45 <shapr> In the US I could order T-Shirts with very large graphics on them
14:47:30 <Smerdyakov> Vincenz, again I ask, there is no software you wish you had to use?
14:47:40 <shapr> I think I just fixed the @fortune module in lambdabot 
14:47:42 <Vincenz> Smerdyakov: not at the moment no
14:47:47 <shapr> I hope so at least.
14:47:51 <Smerdyakov> I've never "come up with project ideas."
14:47:59 <Smerdyakov> If you don't have anything you want to code, why do you want to program?
14:48:04 <shapr> next I need to write QC test for lambdabot (obviously)
14:48:12 <shapr> coding is fun.
14:48:22 <Vincenz> shapr: yup, don't ever say that in public tho
14:48:26 <shapr> why not?
14:48:34 <Vincenz> you get a stamp on your forehead
14:48:41 * shapr checks a mirror
14:48:42 <Igloo> Ooo oooo where do I get my stamp?
14:48:47 <Smerdyakov> You can say that, but I think people who code for that reason alone tend to be poor at it.
14:48:54 <shapr> I disagree.
14:48:56 <shapr> the best coders do it for fun.
14:49:09 * Vincenz agrees wholeheartedly
14:49:25 <Smerdyakov> Prove you're both able to evaluate who "the best coders" are, and we can talk :P
14:49:49 <shapr> Luke Gorrie, Darius Bacon.
14:49:56 <Igloo> Start from the axiom "Igloo is the best coder"
14:50:00 <shapr> yes!
14:50:03 <shapr> that's a good one!
14:50:04 <Igloo> And it all follows trivially
14:50:26 <shapr> absolutely.
14:50:32 <Vincenz> Igloo: well I have this rule that says (Vincenz > Igloo)...now you have a paradox in your system, unless we're both infinitely good
14:51:00 <Igloo>  No, there is a paradox if you assume both systems to be correct
14:51:03 * shapr grins
14:52:30 <Vincenz> Igloo: damnit, don't spoil my moment
14:52:57 <Igloo> :-)

14:54:43 * shapr snickers
14:54:47 <Smerdyakov> Well, I still feel it's likely that people who "search for programming projects" are likely to end up not very good at coding.
14:55:00 <Smerdyakov> Maybe you can find a counterexample.
14:55:00 <Vincenz> Smerdyakov: that's an attempt at me, isn't it?
14:55:03 <shapr> Smerdyakov: you may be right, I don't know.
14:55:15 <shapr> but
14:55:23 <shapr> to me, It looks like coding for fun is the way to get good
14:55:35 <shapr> do what you enjoy doing.
14:55:36 <Smerdyakov> The two are not mutually exclusive.
14:55:54 <shapr> plus if you enjoy doing something, it doesn't really matter how good or bad you are at it...
14:55:59 <shapr> you're just having fun doing it at all.
14:56:05 <Smerdyakov> All that is irrelevant to my statement....
14:56:09 <Vincenz> until someone reads your code and sees
14:56:14 <Vincenz> if (a == NULL)
14:56:16 <Vincenz> a = NULL;
14:56:31 <shapr> I haven't written any code like that lately ;-)
14:57:11 <shapr> crapola
14:57:15 <shapr> the bug is still there.
14:57:37 <shapr> oh duh
14:57:50 <Smerdyakov> I haven't written any code like that lately ;-)
14:57:53 <Smerdyakov> Yay!
14:57:53 <Vincenz> ewll, it's almost 1 am
14:57:55 <shapr> grrr

15:19:15 <shapr> what's it saying?
15:19:35 <shapr> lambdabot: @fortune
15:19:36 <lambdabot> The individual choice of garnishment of a burger can be an important
15:19:36 <lambdabot> point to the consumer in this day when individualism is an increasingly
15:19:36 <lambdabot> important thing to people.
15:19:36 <lambdabot> 		-- Donald N. Smith, president of Burger King
15:20:00 * shapr decides to add the offensive fortunes to the mix for entertainment
15:20:13 <Riastradh> Ambiguous type variable(s) `elt' in the constraint `Typeable elt' arising from the use of `ModuleState' at KarmaModule.hs:28
15:20:43 <Riastradh> And then it points out the source of the error, 'the second argument of (.), `ModuleState.''
15:21:06 <shapr> I think you want to say ( Typeable a ) => FiniteMap z a
15:21:16 <shapr> or something like that
15:21:35 <Riastradh> In the instance declaration?
15:22:12 <shapr> can you paste that line and maybe the one above and below it?
15:22:52 <Riastradh> liftIO . newIORef . ModuleState $ unitFM "_" 0
15:23:08 <Riastradh> It's what's bound to something in a 'do.'
15:23:35 <Riastradh> The 'unitFM' gizmo was an attempt to hack it to find out that it was a FiniteMap of Strings and Integers.
15:24:33 <Riastradh> Er, that is, to hack it so it found out blah blah.
15:24:39 <shapr> right, I dig
15:24:42 <shapr> I think
15:25:55 <shapr> you could use "emptyFM :: FiniteMap String Int"
15:26:40 <shapr> Riastradh: yes, I think that will fix it
15:26:44 <shapr> here's why I think that:
15:26:50 <shapr> Prelude Data.FiniteMap> emptyFM :: FiniteMap String Int
15:26:50 <shapr> No instance for (Show (FiniteMap String Int))
15:26:54 <shapr> Prelude Data.FiniteMap> unitFM "_" 0
15:26:54 <shapr> No instance for (Show (FiniteMap [Char] elt))
15:26:55 <shapr> see?
15:27:17 <shapr> I'm guessing that zero can be anything in the Num class
15:27:25 <Darius> That should work as I think the problem is that it's looking for (Num a) => a which isn't necessarily an instance of Typeable
15:27:27 <shapr> so it's not sure what to do with it.
15:27:44 <Riastradh> Oh...weird.
15:28:11 <Riastradh> It still doesn't work with the 'emptyFm' bit.
15:28:29 <shapr> same complaint?
15:29:00 <Riastradh> No, different.
15:29:15 <shapr> yours should be the same if you add an explicit type signature (unitFM "_" 0 :: FiniteMap String Int)
15:29:58 <shapr> pesco: oops
15:30:07 <Riastradh> Ah, it now only has two type errors.
15:30:09 <shapr> I shouldn't have said anything
15:30:14 <Riastradh> When previously it had four.
15:30:51 <pesco> shapr: Huh?
15:30:59 <shapr> pesco: wasn't that your bot that just joined #joy ?
15:31:11 <shapr> powerpc-pesco-li ?
15:31:20 <pesco> Yes it was!
15:31:22 <shapr> yay!
15:31:25 <shapr> then I said something to it
15:31:29 <shapr> and I think it crashed.
15:31:34 <pesco> No, I ^C-ed it.
15:31:37 <shapr> oh, ok
15:31:50 <shapr> pesco: yay! you got lambdabot to compile and run on powerpc linux unknown!
15:31:59 <pesco> *g*
15:32:00 * shapr dances happily
15:33:51 <pesco> There we go! Say hi everyone to lambdabot running on powerpc-apple-linux!
15:34:03 <shapr> lambdabot: hi!
15:34:03 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
15:34:09 <shapr> er

15:34:16 <shapr> yay!
15:34:28 <pesco> I took the factoid module out, though.
15:34:32 <shapr> powerpc-linux: @join #joy

15:35:53 <pesco> /usr/share/games/fortune doesn't exist.
15:36:14 <shapr> ahem
15:36:20 <shapr> I need to add some error checking there.
15:36:23 <pesco> *g*
15:37:48 * shapr fixes
15:42:45 <pesco> powerpc-linux: @fortune
15:42:48 <pesco> haha
15:42:51 <shapr> oops
15:42:59 <shapr> I haven't finished the error checking yet :-)
15:43:09 <pesco> But more graceful than last time. And quicker. *g*
15:43:16 <pesco> but I need sleep now.
15:43:20 <shapr> me too
15:43:23 <shapr> g'nite all
15:43:25 <pesco> I'll be more for some hacking tomorrow!
15:43:31 <shapr> me too!
15:43:34 <pesco> Good night everyone!
15:43:35 * shapr falls over asleep
15:46:04 <Riastradh> Yay, my karma module works.
15:51:20 <mgoetze> Riastradh: excellent.
16:21:50 <dark> Hello.  Did you see the "whitespace" programming language announced on april 1st?  I noticed it's implemented in Haskell :)
16:22:45 <Darius> I was thinking of implementing a similar language not too long ago, however I was going to have it only have three operations
16:23:21 <dark> I love the sample program they show on the intro page :)
16:30:00 <Pseudonym> Greetings.
16:30:10 <Darius> heya
16:30:17 <Pseudonym> Actually, there is a Turing-complete one instruction machine somewhere.
16:30:29 <Pseudonym> I think it's "decrement and branch if less than zero".
16:30:38 <Darius> But it takes two operands
16:30:50 <Pseudonym> No, only one.
16:31:13 <Pseudonym> It operates on an arbitrary precision integer accumulator.
16:31:16 <Pseudonym> I think.
16:48:37 <Riastradh> shapr - Update lambdabot, there's a new karma module in the repository.
20:12:15 <hdaume> hi all
20:34:10 <Pseudonym> G'day.
21:49:14 * Pseudonym woohoos
21:50:03 <Pseudonym> *EReal> showp 200 (sin 0.01 / 0.01)
21:50:03 <Pseudonym> "0.99998333341666646825424382690997290389643853601691510338791e0"
21:50:06 <Pseudonym> Lotsa precision.
23:52:56 <vardamir> can i post a short program here i'm having trouble with?  this is my first haskell program (I was hoping to get it working before I go to sleep as it will take some time to run)
23:53:33 <Marvin--> how many lines?
23:53:49 <vardamir> 18 including empty lines
23:54:33 <Marvin--> paste it in #flood
23:54:38 <vardamir> ok
23:55:18 <vardamir> i'm having issues with the bracket or something
23:56:03 <Marvin--> your problem is that  read p  isn't an Int, or Float, it's an  IO Int  or  IO Float
23:56:10 <Marvin--> and you can't subtract things from an IO Int
23:56:42 <Marvin--> try readLine instead of getLine
23:57:05 <Marvin--> and you have to say  let perf = perfect p (newline) savenum perf
23:57:10 <Marvin--> 'cause perfect is the function, right?
23:57:26 <vardamir> yeah, still not sure what "let" is all about i guess
23:57:54 <Marvin--> do you know the let .. in .. expressions?
23:58:20 <vardamir> no
23:58:29 <Marvin--> let var = expression in anotherexpression
23:58:34 <Marvin--> it's like local variables
23:58:38 <vardamir> oh, ok
23:58:53 <Marvin--> and when you're inside a do expression, you skip the in, so just  let var = expression
23:59:07 <Marvin--> it actually translates to let perf = perfect p in do ...
23:59:45 <Marvin--> and of course you have to say openFile "filename" WriteMode, but you can also use writeFile directly
