02:21:37 <lambdabot> YUGGA-HUGGA-BUGGA-TUGGA!!  HEY-HEY!!  A TRAIN STATION!!  No, a POST
02:21:37 <lambdabot>  OFFICE!!  An OCEAN LINER!!  No, I think it's a CAFETERIA!!!
02:38:29 <shapr> hi [_tron_] 
02:38:31 <shapr> wassup?
02:39:46 <[_tron_]> hi
02:41:43 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
02:44:11 <[_tron_]> yes
02:44:26 <shapr> for school or for fun?
02:45:03 <shapr> hi prologic 
02:45:14 <[_tron_]> not for school
02:45:17 <prologic> hi shapr :)
02:47:21 <shapr> how's code?
02:49:55 <prologic> hehe
02:50:01 <prologic> had enough of coding for a while :)
02:50:04 <prologic> wait till end of exams :)
02:50:25 <Lunar^> shapr: played with GHCiModule ?
02:50:40 <shapr> Lunar^: no, not yet
02:52:04 <Lunar^> It's really usefull to help students
02:52:44 <shapr> yes, I saw that
02:52:52 <shapr> hi Arnia 
03:14:23 <Lunar^> shapr: btw, the PDF binding is doing really well, I want to test it more (for my own needs) before a new commit to hlibs
03:14:56 <shapr> sounds great
03:32:34 <shapr> boing
03:43:05 <shapr> hi blitznl, ltns
03:43:27 <shapr> the SMPized Haskell mailing list discussion was informative
03:45:03 <Heffalump> in a "this is really hard to do" kind of sense?
03:45:16 <shapr> yes :-)
03:45:34 <shapr> hi harsha123 
03:45:42 <harsha123> shapr helloooo..
03:45:54 <shapr> seems the crux of the matter is multithreaded GC
03:46:06 * harsha123 had a long weekend... its festival time here..
03:46:19 <shapr> is the festival of lights around this time?
03:46:25 * shapr can't remember
03:46:32 <harsha123> whoohooo.. Yep.. shapr is right..
03:46:34 <shapr> yay
03:46:36 <Heffalump> weren't the locks required a problem too?
03:47:03 <harsha123> hello everyone hi Heffalump 
03:47:35 <shapr> those sorts of mailing list threads should probably turn into summary articles, they would be most informative
03:48:34 <blitznl> shapr: hi, true I've been working on OO related stuff lately
03:48:54 <shapr> blitznl: cool, what sort of OO stuff?
03:49:43 <blitznl> dynamic software updating a.k.a. software re-linking, i.e. updating parts of the code without stopping and restarting the whole program.
03:50:00 <shapr> ah, I've been interested in that in a Haskell context
03:50:57 <shapr> Heffalump wrote a dynamic reloader for lambdabot 
03:51:27 <shapr> the only downside is that static and dynamic code have their own type tables, so you can't do type equality between them
03:52:19 <blitznl> shapr: yeah I am doing it for Java, I think doing stuff like dsu for haskell is scary ;)
03:52:46 <shapr> Lor pointed out that it just requires bringing the type-checker along with the runtime system
03:53:09 <shapr> I wonder if type checkers can be incremental rather than monolithic...
03:53:19 <shapr> I'll probably find out by the time I'm at the end of TaPL
03:54:22 <blitznl> interesting, well I'll do it for java on a bytecode level, but I haven't sorted out how I am going to do it just yet, but I have untill july to do so..
03:54:40 <Heffalump> ugh, no, bringing the type checker into the RTS is sick
03:55:41 <shapr> is there a better way?
03:57:28 <Heffalump> I still don't see what fundamental problem there is with sharing type tables
03:57:38 <Heffalump> how do you type check compiled code anyway?
03:58:29 <shapr> heck if I know
03:58:36 <shapr> how do you share type tables?
03:58:41 <shapr> isn't that the same question?
03:58:48 <Heffalump> no
03:58:55 <shapr> the compiled code has pointers into the type table?
03:59:08 * Heffalump goes to a meeting
03:59:16 <shapr> I don't know enough about the implementation
04:04:02 <shapr> cat /dev/p0
04:04:13 <shapr> echo "hello" > /dev/p0
04:04:18 <Tomasso> hehe
04:04:31 <shapr> y0 y0 p0
04:04:33 <shapr> wassup?
04:18:46 <ozone> my god wolfgang thaller is a crazy bastard
04:19:40 <shapr> how so?
04:20:06 <ozone> he's writing the second revision of his objc/haskell binding
04:20:09 <ozone> and it's nuts
04:20:17 <shapr> what's nuts about it?
04:20:20 <ozone> it's been compiling for about 30 minutes and still going
04:20:25 <steveh> hellooo
04:20:31 <shapr> y0h0 steveh 
04:20:35 <ozone> e.g.
04:20:35 <ozone> Compiling Foundation.NSScriptKeyValueCoding.Forward ( ./Foundation/NSScriptKeyValueCoding/Forward.hs, build/objects/Foundation/NSScriptKeyValueCoding/Forward.o )
04:20:37 <steveh> what news?
04:20:39 <ozone> Compiling Foundation.NSDebug.Forward ( ./Foundation/NSDebug/Forward.hs, build/objects/Foundation/NSDebug/Forward.o )
04:20:41 <ozone> Compiling Foundation.NSDistantObject.Forward ( ./Foundation/NSDistantObject/Forward.hs, build/objects/Foundation/NSDistantObject/Forward.o )
04:20:44 <ozone> Compiling Foundation.NSProtocolChecker.Forward ( ./Foundation/NSProtocolChecker/Forward.hs, build/objects/Foundation/NSProtocolChecker/Forward.o )
04:20:48 <ozone> Compiling Foundation.NSKeyValueCoding.Forward ( ./Foundation/NSKeyValueCoding/Forward.hs, build/objects/Foundation/NSKeyValueCoding/Forward.o )
04:20:51 <ozone> repeat for every since objc class in existance
04:20:52 <shapr> what could take 30 minutes to compile??
04:20:55 <steveh> that's not an objc/haskell binding
04:21:07 <steveh> that's a cocoa/gnustep/openstep - haskell binding
04:21:08 <steveh> ;)
04:21:17 <steveh> ask David Stes
04:21:32 <ozone> shapr: wolfgang-written code :D
04:21:35 <ozone> steveh: pfft, pedant
04:24:10 <shapr> I bought my first playstation2 game yesterday, "Enter the Matrix"
04:24:19 <shapr> the hacking part was fun, but not very challenging
04:24:28 <steveh> did you get to use ssh?
04:24:29 <shapr> I'm not so good at shooting people though
04:24:34 <steveh> iirc in the movie trinity used it
04:24:35 <steveh> :)
04:24:39 <shapr> yah, and nmap
04:24:45 <steveh> hehehe
04:24:53 <shapr> have you seen the xscreensaver that shows that?
04:26:06 <shapr> anyways, the hacking was fun, you got to dial into other systems and play a mastermind game to find a password
04:26:33 <shapr> you can use it to drop weapons to yourself inside the matrix, and download training programs to yourself
04:26:52 <earthy> owh yeah, that objc bridge is nasty
04:27:37 <ozone> HOC?  or mocha?
04:27:37 <earthy> dynamically linking to the objc runtime and then querying it for the objects it knows so the compiler can generate the interface to it with template haskell
04:27:47 <ozone> although both are pretty nasty right now :)
04:27:58 <earthy> ;)
04:28:09 <earthy> Mocha, methinks, the thing Andre Pang did
04:28:28 <ozone> earthy: oh, that'd be me.  you're one of the Utrecht folks?
04:28:40 * earthy grinz
04:28:46 <ozone> (since i dunno how else you'd know about it :)
04:29:11 <earthy> is it released yet? :)
04:29:17 <ozone> it's getting there
04:29:26 <ozone> work is getting in the way, as is one showstopper bug
04:29:30 <earthy> (yeah, I'm one of them sicko's, and you gave me a *great* set of ideas ;))
04:29:48 <ozone> but wolfgang's started work on his HOC stuff again, which is similar to mocha (another objc/haskell binding)
04:30:06 <ozone> so since wolfgang's doings tuff, i'm sure you can expect all the earth's problems will be solved in about four days
04:30:11 <earthy> but it works differently, right? doing the marshalling differently?
04:30:43 <ozone> earthy: he just sent me his latest code.  haven't taken an in-depth look yet, but i'm sure he's lifted plenty of ideas from mocha
04:31:04 <earthy> that'd make sense.
04:31:08 <ozone> i think he generates the actual objc class definitions for the haskell-written objects directly, though, instead of going through a proxy class.  which imho is much cooler
04:31:26 <ozone> and the marshalling is a bit different ... wolfgang's actually parsing the objc header files
04:31:42 <ozone> because the objc runtime doesn't give you quite enough type info, so you can't really do it by reflection :(
04:32:22 <earthy> ah, he's taking roughly the same route Daan is taking with wxHaskell...
04:32:33 <earthy> (parsing header files and generating interfaces from that)
04:32:46 <ozone> yep
04:32:59 <ozone> how are daan and doaitse?
04:33:24 <earthy> daan is hard at work distributing his Ph.D. thesis ;)
04:33:31 <earthy> (the physical booklet :))
04:33:46 <ozone> what's his ph.d on again?  LVM?
04:33:52 <earthy> Doaitse is just generally hard at work.
04:34:09 <earthy> ozone: I'll check my mail pigeon-hole... :)
04:34:14 <ozone> :)
04:34:15 <earthy> (kosmikus should know though)
04:38:32 <steveh> they make me use perl at work :)
04:39:11 <earthy> steveh: and the problem is? :)
04:39:25 <earthy> hm. he hasn't distributed it yet.
04:39:39 * earthy should go and kick daan. his defense is next week! :)
04:46:36 <Heffalump> hehe
04:47:24 <earthy> (and I won't be there to see it, as I'd already made plans to visit the Van Gogh museum with my girlfriend, given that it'll be my birthday and stuff)
04:49:47 <shapr> how old will you be then?
04:50:21 <earthy> I'll be reaching perfect age. ;)
04:50:50 <shapr> 32?
04:51:32 <earthy> 32 is not a perfect number.
04:51:59 * Heffalump doubts earthy will be 6 or 300ish
04:52:18 <Heffalump> so I am forced to conclude he will be 28 :-)
04:52:40 * earthy nods
04:53:09 <Heffalump> oh, I meant 496, not 300ish.
04:53:38 <shapr> I've forgotten how to find perfect numbers
04:53:47 <shapr> it's something about its factors adding up to itself, right?
04:53:55 <Heffalump> yeah
04:54:07 <earthy> yes, the strictly smaller factors adding up to the number itself
05:01:18 <shapr> hi Arnia 
05:04:34 * shapr pounces on Arnia
05:04:35 <shapr> HELLO
05:04:40 <shapr> VRFY ARNIA
05:04:52 <shapr> mmm, coffeee
05:11:01 * earthy hits shapr with a +5 Sendmail Ruleset 3
05:11:35 * shapr fails his savings throw and loses 5 SAN points after dealing with a bunch of compiled-only sendmail.cf regexes
05:21:18 * isomer peeps
05:21:31 * shapr chirps
05:21:39 * isomer whistles
05:21:56 * shapr barks
05:22:27 * isomer immitates a mac user
05:22:40 * isomer snubs
05:24:44 <isomer> how's life, shapr?
05:24:48 <shapr> life is here
05:25:04 <shapr> I'm playing around with random code bits
05:25:41 <isomer> neat
05:25:44 <shapr> what's up with you?
05:25:59 <isomer> last midterm today -- then i get my life back
05:26:02 <shapr> yay!
05:26:17 <isomer> i'm working on a little vm
05:26:22 <shapr> for what?
05:26:38 <isomer> for fun, of course
05:26:45 <isomer> oh...you mean for what language?
05:27:00 <isomer> smalltalk, lisp... whatever
05:27:10 <isomer> non-denominational
05:27:33 <shapr> heh
05:28:17 <isomer> i'm going to write a lisp parser first ... because it's so easy
05:31:29 <shapr> Lunar^: did you build HSX11 1.0 with greencard 3.01 ?
05:33:41 <shapr> has anyone here tried to build HSX11 on debian?
05:56:42 <Lunar^> shapr: yes
05:56:51 <Lunar^> shapr: I had to build greencard by my hands
05:57:16 <Lunar^> shapr: And I had to use HSX11 1.0 (at Reid ltd) and not the one dist. with GHC
05:57:33 <Lunar^> shapr: HGL (haskell.org/graphics) build fines after that
05:57:57 <shapr> hm, I'm using the greencard debian package, but I get errors
05:58:07 <shapr> did that happen to you too?
05:58:19 <Lunar^> shapr: YES
05:58:38 <shapr> zillions of this:
05:58:41 <shapr> <unknown>, line <unknown>:
05:58:41 <shapr>       Don't know how to unmarshall (word8 res1)
05:58:49 <shapr> I'll try to manually build greencard
05:59:56 <Lunar^> Yes that ones
05:59:59 <Lunar^> dunno why
06:00:14 <shapr> Heffalump built the greencard debs, I'll tell him something's broken
06:00:18 <shapr> if this fixes it, that is
06:00:40 <shapr> what $HOME did you give?
06:01:10 <Lunar^> dunno
06:01:14 <shapr> ok
06:03:01 <Igloo> I don't think he's particularly interested in it as he turned out not to need it, BICBW
06:03:10 <shapr> Lunar^: when you run greencard --version do you get 3.00 ?
06:03:19 * Igloo encourages people to make proper Debian packages for these things
06:04:00 <shapr> there is a greencard 3.01 deb
06:04:16 <shapr> I'm not sure it works though
06:04:54 <shapr> yep, it's the 3.01 deb
06:04:57 <shapr> hand-built 3.01 works
06:12:05 <shapr> write barriers are much like monads... interesting
06:16:29 <Lor> Write barriers as in GC or as in that kernel thingy?
06:17:25 <Lunar^> shapr: mhh?
06:19:42 <isomer> don't follow
06:31:10 <earthy> The $\lambda$ Abroad -- A functional approach to software components
06:31:22 <earthy> that's daan's thesis' title
06:58:34 <shapr> heh, cute title
06:59:29 <earthy> shapr: and it's online at Daan's website by now as well. ;)
06:59:43 <earthy> so even though you don't get all the purple paper goodness, you can get the contents
07:02:33 <shapr> purple paper?
07:02:42 <earthy> shapr: the cover is purple
07:02:45 <shapr> wow, nifty
07:02:51 <earthy> with a moon on it. vewwy pwetty
07:03:04 <earthy> oh, no, not the moon. mercure. ;)
07:03:46 <shapr> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/pubs.html
07:04:02 <shapr> he's changed the look of his website
07:04:11 <earthy> that too. ;) I like it
07:04:19 <earthy> (and have been thinking of ripping it for my own ;))
07:07:07 <shapr> hm, should I point out misspellings in the paper? :-)
07:43:55 <shapr> hi H0lyD4wg
07:44:01 <shapr> interesting nickname, what's the significance?
07:45:13 <H0lyD4wg> shapr: none in particular, i picked it 'cause it has a nice sound and looks good written.
07:45:19 <shapr> ok
07:45:35 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
07:46:42 <H0lyD4wg> shapr: no, but i have i few questions about lazy evaluation and i figured the best people to ask would be Haskellers
07:47:24 <Smerdyakov> Well, we can't answer if you don't ask!
07:47:43 <Igloo> I bet we could
07:48:06 <shapr> yah, we could
07:48:10 <Igloo> But I'm to busy to try  :-)
07:48:12 <shapr> but it might be hard to give the right answer
07:48:13 <shapr> heh
07:48:48 <harsha123> so whats the discussion guys? 
07:49:07 <H0lyD4wg> well, afaik Haskell is totally pure. from what i understand it has to be that way, or else evil things will happen.
07:49:33 <shapr> right
07:49:35 <H0lyD4wg> yes/no?
07:49:45 <shapr> harsha123: I'm playing with xosd
07:49:49 <shapr> harsha123: what are you doing?
07:50:23 <harsha123> shapr: just came back from dinner, looking into tc 
07:50:34 <shapr> tc? turbo C compiler?
07:50:40 <harsha123> hehehehe.. nooooooooo way.. 
07:50:48 <harsha123> tc as in traffic controller... :)
07:50:51 <shapr> oh, ok
07:51:07 <shapr> there are several new traffic control debs in the last coupla days
07:51:32 <shapr> H0lyD4wg: more questions?
07:51:40 <Smerdyakov> H0lyD4wg, lazy evaluation is very confusing when you have side effects.
07:51:47 <harsha123> hmmm.. what do you mean by a *few* new debs?
07:52:09 <shapr> harsha123: I saw three or four new debs that dealt with traffic control, though I didn't investigate
07:52:25 <shapr> I think there were at least two separate traffic control/logging packages
07:52:26 <harsha123> hmm...Ok.. at the debian site?
07:52:41 <shapr> I just looked at the new packages list in aptitude
07:52:48 <harsha123> ok.
07:53:22 <H0lyD4wg> Smerdyakov: very confusing as in "requires wizard level of skills" or as in "i'd rather use INTERCAL than get myself into that mess"?
07:53:35 <Smerdyakov> H0lyD4wg, the latter.
07:54:17 <harsha123> shapr: whats aptitude? 
07:54:18 <Smerdyakov> If you pass a side-effecting expression as a function parameter, whether or not the effect occurs is dependent on the function definition.
07:54:38 <shapr> aptitude is a frontend for dpkg/apt-get etal
07:54:52 <shapr> much like deselect, synaptic, etc
07:54:53 <harsha123> shapr: dselect?
07:54:57 <shapr> yup
07:55:00 <harsha123> shapr ok..
07:55:02 <shapr> but better than dselect
07:55:08 <shapr> synaptic is even pretty
07:55:15 <harsha123> ok..
07:55:16 <shapr> though a bit harder to use over ssh
07:55:23 <harsha123> ok
07:55:41 <harsha123> shapr: you seem to be a bit free today , don't you ?
07:56:00 <shapr> what do you mean by that? :-)
07:56:15 <shapr> I'm at least easy, if not free ;-)
07:56:37 <harsha123> :) hehehe... you are usually busy hacking.. :) thats what i meant
07:57:06 <shapr> yah, I have less work lately
07:57:25 <shapr> probably will have less work for the next month
07:57:42 <harsha123> good, we will have more of your wisdom.. :)
07:57:48 <shapr> heh
07:58:02 * shapr pretends to be a guru
07:58:05 <H0lyD4wg> Smerdyakov: what if you have a way to force the evaluation of the expression and pass the result to the function?
07:58:12 * isomer pretends to worship shapr ;)
07:58:18 <shapr> grasshoppa, when you can snatch the lambda from my hand, then you will have true speed
07:58:24 <harsha123> hehehe.. good one isomer 
07:58:39 <shapr> you must train your strength to learn lambda lifting
07:58:53 <Smerdyakov> H0lyD4wg, then the language is sort of not strictly lazy anymore.
07:59:27 <isomer> anyone know of a good reference on how to build a cps transforming compiler?
08:00:19 <shapr> ask Darius, he'll probably know
08:00:25 <shapr> Darius has much wisdom
08:00:46 <isomer> okay
08:01:16 <H0lyD4wg> Smerdyakov: but the non-side-affecting parts can still benefit from lazy evaluation, true/false?
08:01:38 <shapr> I'm still not sure I understand CPS well enough to use it
08:02:10 <shapr> andersca: hey, you awake?
08:03:16 <andersca> shapr: ja
08:04:00 <shapr> is there a window manager tutorial somewhere?
08:04:35 <shapr> where would I start with a Haskell window manager? any advice?
08:05:08 <harsha123> shapr: i get a http  404 error (file not found) on doing apt-get 
08:05:31 <shapr> harsha123: have you done apt-get update lately?
08:05:44 <harsha123> shapr: yep did it yesterday.. 
08:05:51 <shapr> what's the error?
08:05:59 <shapr> what file are you trying to download?
08:06:12 <harsha123> shapr: i was trying to install synaptic
08:06:44 <shapr> works fine for me, can you give me more detail?
08:07:20 <shapr> try "apt-get update && apt-get -uf install synaptic"
08:07:28 <shapr> it's possible that your local mirror is temporarily down
08:07:30 <harsha123> shapr : the error is "Error 404 File not found" and the file is libgnomecanvas
08:07:38 <shapr> oh
08:08:11 <harsha123> shapr: i am doing an apt-get update 
08:09:30 <harsha123> shapr: can you use haskell to build compilers?
08:09:40 <shapr> sure
08:09:53 <shapr> there's a compiler toolkit in fact
08:09:56 <shapr> CTK
08:10:00 <harsha123> shapr: but isnt haskell slow for it?
08:10:04 <harsha123> ok
08:10:20 <shapr> the meaning of 'slow' depends on what's important to you
08:10:51 <shapr> a compiler written in Haskell will execute slower than a compiler written in C, but development and maintenance will take much less time
08:11:05 <harsha123> but when i compile simple programs, i can kinda observer the delay.. i run a 700Mhz processor
08:11:16 <shapr> since programmer time is usually more expensive than hardware, most people pick a high level language for development
08:11:20 <harsha123> hmm.. i understand
08:11:41 <shapr> in my opinion, unless you're developing a major app for an 8 MHz CPU, you don't need to write in C or C++
08:11:55 <harsha123> hehe Ok..
08:12:25 <shapr> even if you were writing an app for Symbian for example, I'd still suggest you write 99% of the app in a higher level language and only write speed critical parts in C or assembly, and then wrap those for use in the higher level language
08:12:44 <harsha123> ok..
08:13:20 <shapr> years ago, in #python on EFNet, slug worked for trilobyte games (before they died)
08:14:24 <shapr> slug and two other guys wrote "extreme warfare" in Python. Once it worked, they profiled the code. Whenever something was too slow they rewrote the most central part of that code in C, and wrapped it so that it looked the same as the Python code that was there
08:14:41 <harsha123> trilobyte? whats that?
08:14:52 <shapr> trilobyte was a PC game company from some years back
08:14:59 <harsha123> oh.. ok
08:15:24 <shapr> they found out that 97% of the CPU time was spent in the graphics code, even though that was less than 5% of the actual code
08:15:35 <shapr> so once that was fast, the rest worked fine
08:15:36 <isomer> shapr: you're dispensing good advice for a pretend guru
08:15:39 <shapr> heh
08:15:54 <andersca> shapr: I'm gonna start hacking on one very soon, for the afp stuff
08:16:07 <shapr> andersca: can I help?
08:16:18 <harsha123> shapr: whats this bonobo activation?
08:16:22 <shapr> harsha123: http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers
08:16:25 <andersca> shapr: not until I've presented it to koen :)
08:16:35 <shapr> that wiki page gives a more general presentation of the same idea
08:16:38 <isomer> just to add some support here: i worked on a C 3d game engine for 2 years (paid work, honest) and 90% of the time is spent in opengl calls. only 10% is spend doing everything else
08:16:57 <isomer> it could easily be rewritten in a high level language
08:18:58 <shapr> isomer: how much dev time could you have saved if you'd used Smalltalk with lower level C libs wrapped?
08:20:07 <isomer> well, frankly not that much - we used a very limited subset of C++ (no virtual functions, no memory allocation once the game was running) so it behaved as if it were high level
08:20:12 <isomer> BUT....
08:20:29 <shapr> ?
08:20:42 <isomer> refactoring code in C++ is a living nightmare. A major refactor sends you into nothing-compiles-and-it-may-never-again mode for a week at a time
08:20:44 <isomer> very scary
08:20:55 <shapr> why is that?
08:20:59 <isomer> static typing
08:21:10 <shapr> doesn't cause me problems in Haskell
08:21:14 <isomer> well, really lack of tools
08:22:03 <isomer> if the tools dealt with it properly it would be no problem. ie rename a class, move a class, change return type or argument type... 
08:22:08 <isomer> if it were all automated, it would be easyt
08:22:13 <shapr> andersca: plwm is a wm written in Python. I'm checking out the sources, and it doesn't look too hard...
08:22:40 <andersca> shapr: it isn't
08:23:07 <shapr> well, tell me what Koen says, I think it'd be a fun project
08:23:35 <shapr> especially with ozone's RuntimeLoader involved =)
08:26:25 <harsha123> shapr: plwm looks neat..:)
08:26:58 <harsha123> shapr: do we need pyGTK hooks?
08:27:16 <shapr> ?
08:27:18 <shapr> for what?
08:27:35 <harsha123> if you are doin the window manager in python..
08:28:31 <shapr> plwm already works, I want to write a window manager in Haskell
08:28:42 <harsha123> oh, ok.. 
08:29:04 * isomer is really digging the aero gtk theme
08:30:16 <harsha123> but does haskell have tools/api's to design such window managers?
08:30:46 <shapr> sure
08:30:57 <shapr> the HSX11 binding for example
08:31:04 <harsha123> hmmm... ok
08:31:50 <harsha123> shapr: do you now want to design one in haskell on the lines of plwm?
08:33:16 <shapr> yup
08:33:51 <shapr> cow_2001: different nickname now?
08:33:56 <cow_2001> ?
08:34:11 <shapr> no longer H0lyD4wg?
08:34:20 <cow_2001> i've joined here because my friend h0lyd4wg was here
08:34:26 <shapr> oh, ok
08:34:34 <shapr> hi cow_2001
08:34:37 <cow_2001> we are not the same person
08:34:41 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
08:34:41 <cow_2001> hi :)
08:34:43 <cow_2001> nope
08:34:46 <shapr> would you like to? :-)
08:34:48 <cow_2001> i'm not even a lisper
08:34:58 <shapr> I'm not a lisper either, unless you count elisp.
08:35:37 <cow_2001> um... i'm just a humble user who tries to write some game in python
08:35:40 <cow_2001> reversi
08:35:49 <shapr> cool, have you written it?
08:36:07 <cow_2001> it'll be text mode
08:36:20 <cow_2001> no fancie graphix
08:36:46 <shapr> does it work?
08:36:50 <cow_2001> nope
08:37:01 <cow_2001> i don't have a singel function yet
08:37:15 <shapr> I'd suggest starting with a unit test
08:37:19 <shapr> works for me
08:37:29 <cow_2001> but i have the base idea of how i should make islegal() function
08:37:36 <cow_2001> unit test?
08:38:08 <shapr> a unit test is an automated test that checks a function to see if it works correctly
08:38:21 <cow_2001> how should i build one?
08:38:36 <shapr> with pyunit
08:38:40 <shapr> that's what I use
08:38:50 <SyntaxPolice> yoyo shapr, my man!
08:38:52 <shapr> here's an example: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/src/python/test_nn2mdb.py
08:38:52 <cow_2001> i'll check it out
08:38:53 <cow_2001> thanks
08:39:08 * harsha123 is back
08:39:09 <cow_2001> :)
08:39:09 <cow_2001> thanks
08:39:15 <shapr> y0y0 SyntaxPolice, how's the syntax enforcement going?
08:39:30 <shapr> cow_2001: try to write a unit test for islegal()
08:39:35 <SyntaxPolice> great! everyone is obeying the syntax law
08:39:35 <SyntaxPolice> s
08:40:22 <cow_2001> SyntaxPolice, wadu you mean ppl r obeying teh syntax laws?
08:40:43 <SyntaxPolice> I am the SyntaxPolice, I enforce syntax.
08:40:56 <cow_2001> SyntaxPolice, (it was a joke... :) )
08:40:57 <SyntaxPolice> you know when you get syntax errors in your code? Those are my deputies.
08:41:15 <SyntaxPolice> cow_2001: you're lucky I'm off duty ;)
08:41:24 <cow_2001> :)
08:41:36 <cow_2001> eating doughnuts?
08:41:45 <isomer> SyntaxPolice: hey -- cow_2001 just used an unopened paren! what's the fine for that?
08:41:58 <cow_2001> )
08:42:05 <shapr> whew, saved by the paren
08:42:12 * isomer makes a citizen's arrest
08:42:15 <cow_2001> :)
08:42:18 * shapr arrests himself
08:42:24 <shapr> I'm a legal alien!
08:42:27 <Igloo> Syn: I wrote {>{$}l<{$}>{$}c<{$}>{$}l<{$}} today. I think I should turn myself in.
08:42:38 <shapr> Igloo: I'm afraid to ask what that actually does.
08:43:05 <Igloo> It's TeX for left, centered, left-aligned math columns in a tabular
08:43:14 <shapr> hei Esa
08:43:33 <shapr> mitta kuuluu?
08:43:39 <esap> Ihan hyv‰‰.
08:43:44 <isomer> hakuna matata!
08:43:53 <shapr> isomer: I don't think that's finnish.
08:44:03 <shapr> though admittedly, I don't know much finnish.
08:44:06 <isomer> er...
08:44:16 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: you just turned yourself in!
08:44:32 <SyntaxPolice> I'm slapping you all with a -Wall 
08:44:37 <shapr> oh no! not that!
08:44:45 <shapr> would that be Larry -Wall?
08:45:41 <shapr> hm, how do I write unit tests for lambdabot?
08:47:09 <isomer> @arr
08:47:10 <lambdabot> Arrr!
08:47:15 <shapr> @arr
08:47:15 <lambdabot> Is that a hornpipe in yer pocket, or arr ya just happy ta see me?
08:47:21 * isomer tests the pirate function
08:47:25 <shapr> @yow
08:47:25 <lambdabot> Your CHEEKS sit like twin NECTARINES above a MOUTH that knows no BOUNDS --
08:47:46 <shapr> @fortune
08:47:47 <lambdabot> Teachers have class.
08:47:49 <shapr> heh
08:48:04 * SyntaxPolice thought that the "arr" was supposed to sound like a hornpipe
08:48:11 <andersca> Haskell programmers have type class.
08:48:12 <shapr> what does a hornpipe sound like?
08:48:15 <shapr> andersca: hah!
08:48:24 <andersca> sorry
08:48:24 <andersca> :)
08:48:30 <Lor> Shapr, it's "mit‰", you know.
08:48:35 <shapr> Lor: yah yah :-)
08:48:43 <shapr> mit√§
08:48:50 <shapr> er
08:49:01 <Lor> Yeah, in utf-8.
08:49:02 <shapr> I'm going to take finnish classes after I've learned swedish
08:49:43 <Lor> Is there some "official" character encoding in freenode, or on this channel in particular?
08:49:52 <shapr> not really
08:50:09 <shapr> latin-1 is the standard according to the IRC RFCs
08:50:17 <Lor> All right.
08:50:18 <shapr> but utf-8 is the standard on the #haskell.se for example
08:50:47 <Lor> Finnish is horrendously difficult, y'know.
08:50:49 <shapr> happily, I can switch my client easily enough y√§y
08:51:04 <Lor> Thankfully, it's at least easy to pronounce (or to spell, whichever way you wish to look at it).
08:51:04 <shapr> mina ymmaran
08:51:23 <shapr> mina tieda
08:51:32 <shapr> mina haluan suklataa!
08:51:40 <shapr> heh, it's been awhile since I've tried to speak any finnish
08:52:05 <shapr> Lor: finnish is also very cool
08:52:12 <shapr> all those double vowels are very stylin
08:52:36 <shapr> and having seventeen different cases that you can mix and match onto random words is also spiffy
08:52:44 <Lor> Have you learned those phrases verbally?
08:52:56 <shapr> I took finnish classes for a coupla years
08:53:01 <Lor> Since your spelling is a bit off.
08:53:05 <shapr> yah, I know
08:54:00 <harsha123> shapr : you are just short of being called a "linguist" in every sense..
08:54:17 <shapr> hey, I'm not *that* short!
08:54:24 * shapr pretends to be a midget
08:54:32 <harsha123> hehehe..
08:54:34 <shapr> :-)
08:54:59 <shapr> I'm not really a linguist, I just like to play with languages. My woman can actually speak four or five languages
08:55:17 * esap just looked up 'linguist': "linguist, polyglot -- (a person who speaks more than one language)"
08:55:51 <shapr> I can only speak english, and some swedish and french. I've learned a bit of finnish, but it's way hard to actually speak.
08:56:07 * harsha123 can speak 4 languages.. :)
08:56:17 <shapr> see, you're more of a linguist than I am :-)
08:56:33 <harsha123> hehehe.. but all indian languages..
08:59:16 <SyntaxPolice> @yow
08:59:16 <lambdabot> Yow!  Now we can become alcoholics!
09:02:21 <shapr> what's the maximum line length for freenode?
09:09:38 <esap> Q: do you think ($) should have different associativity than ($!)?
09:10:27 <Lor> Yes.
09:10:42 <Lor> Or rather the other way around, $! should be left-associative.
09:11:09 <esap> ok.
09:11:14 <esap> I thought so.
09:13:14 <esap> Is there a good general way of determining correct associativity for arbitrary binary functions?
09:13:43 <Lor> See which way it's used more often.
09:15:35 <shapr> fgrep -r 'flip ' * | wc -l
09:16:11 * esap gets 44.
09:16:37 * shapr tries on hlibs
09:16:58 <shapr> 54
09:17:52 <shapr> Lunar^: when will sebc return? I want my wiwiwi fix!
09:19:24 * esap thinks that fgrep overcounted. I got matches for 'group_flip :: (Group f, Group g) => (f a -> g (g b)) -> f (f a) -> g b' :-)
09:20:14 <shapr> well
09:20:48 <shapr> what about \W ?
09:21:15 <shapr> I think that's word boundary
09:21:26 <shapr> anyways, word boundary will give you a better count
09:21:43 * esap gets 42. Nice round number.
09:22:18 <esap> it's -w not -W btw.
09:23:38 <shapr> oh
09:23:54 <shapr> capital W is whitespace?
09:24:14 <esap> linux grep didn't like -W at all.
09:24:35 <Lunar^> shapr: sebc's returned
09:24:47 <shapr> Lunar^: yay!
09:24:52 <Lunar^> shapr: He needs to get a new internet connection at home
09:24:54 <shapr> is wise-language.org online again?
09:24:57 <shapr> oh foo
09:25:11 <shapr> esap: grep -r '\Wflip\W' *| wc -l
09:25:24 <esap> oh :-)
09:25:34 <shapr> which still doesn't fix everything
09:25:39 <shapr> word boundaries aren't the same in Haskell
09:25:45 <shapr> it catches flip-board in chess
09:25:55 * esap used fgrep -r -w 'flip' * | wc -l
09:26:03 <Igloo> flip-board isn't a Haskell identifier
09:26:06 <Lunar^> shapr: They just finished some paper for ESOP 2004
09:26:07 <Igloo> Presumably you mean flip_board?
09:26:32 <shapr> Igloo: actually, flip-board is a command
09:26:37 <shapr> @flip-board
09:26:38 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "flip-board", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
09:26:53 <shapr> good point
09:26:55 <Igloo> Oh, right, so in a string?
09:26:59 <shapr> yes, so you were right :-)
09:27:08 <Igloo> But for the wrong reason?  :-)
09:27:10 <shapr> heh
09:27:28 <shapr> well, being right is nice anyway you get there
09:28:05 <isomer> *grumble* do these tasteless winter tomatos have any nutritional value at all, or are they the cheeze whiz of the vegetable world?
09:28:18 <shapr> isomer: they taste of snow
09:28:23 <isomer> they suck
09:28:29 <shapr> tyvarr
09:29:16 <isomer> @arr
09:29:17 <lambdabot> Smartly me lass
09:32:16 * steveh unidles.
09:32:39 <steveh> Who is here to entertain me? :)
09:33:03 <shapr> me me!
09:33:06 <shapr> I can entertain!
09:33:18 * shapr dances on the tabletop
09:33:37 <steveh> lol
09:34:04 * steveh has not kept up with the haskell-programming :-/
09:34:06 <shapr> http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?LearningAndWeightLifting
09:34:17 <shapr> steveh: well, get back on the lambda wagon
09:35:05 <steveh> heh
09:35:32 <steveh> right now I am using python's twisted framework for an app on my own time
09:35:37 <shapr> yes, twisted is nifty
09:35:38 <steveh> and at work they use java and perl
09:35:40 <steveh> :-P
09:35:46 <shapr> you could write TwistedHaskell
09:35:50 <steveh> Ha!
09:35:53 <shapr> that would give you the best of both worlds
09:36:06 <steveh> that would entail quite a bit more skill than I currently have
09:36:16 <shapr> nah, it's easier than it looks
09:36:34 <shapr> of course if that were really true, I'd probably have finished it...
09:36:42 <jameson> What does this "twisted" framework do?
09:36:48 <shapr> hi jameson 
09:36:52 <steveh> I am still at the "IO is black magic" stage of haskell understanding
09:37:01 <jameson> Hi! (sorry for not saying "hello" earlier :-)
09:37:11 <shapr> no worries
09:37:15 <shapr> are you new around here?
09:37:50 <esap> google says twisted framework is used for network programming.
09:37:53 <jameson> shapr: Sort of. I've been here a few times in the past, but I thought I might as well lurk a bit, in the hopes of stumbling across useful tidbits of information :-)
09:38:15 <steveh> jameson: it is a solution for the problem of Python not being conducive to the common threaded-server approach to networking
09:38:32 <steveh> in the same way that TeX is a solution for the problem of plaintext not being conducive to typesetting
09:38:32 <steveh> :)
09:39:15 * esap is reading code that has a line: 'from twisted.internet import reactor'. Twisted, indeed.
09:39:34 <steveh> esap: :)
09:39:48 <steveh> esap: what would you call something that waits for network events?
09:39:52 <jameson> Threaded-server approach... so what's the problem there? Python has threads, IIRC, so what is it missing?
09:40:04 <steveh> jameson: they are not OS-level threads
09:40:18 <esap> steveh: event loop?
09:40:49 <steveh> esap: that will cause a mental naming conflict with the GUI's main event loop
09:40:50 <jameson> steveh: Oh, OK. That makes sense, then. Do they wrap around system IO to avoid blocking by hand or do they just use OS threads instead?
09:41:13 <esap> steveh: not, if you use the same event loop for both... :-)
09:41:23 <steveh> esap
09:41:37 <steveh> esap: I do think some of the names in twisted are silly, but reactor isn't one of them :)
09:41:54 <steveh> "Eventloop" isn't an object in my cognitive version of things
09:42:08 <steveh> rather an execution primitive of sorts
09:42:10 <jameson> What's an event loop anyway... how does that fit into the monadic view of the world?
09:42:38 <esap> jameson: event loop is the thing that executes the commands of the IO monad.
09:42:58 <shapr> oops, I was distracted by a bad joke
09:43:00 <steveh> jameson: event loops are commonly found in GUIs. basically the computer runs through a mostly-empty loop infinitely, until someone clicks on a button or some other "event" happnes
09:43:17 <shapr> if someone tells me that I suck, it's obviously a fellacious argument
09:43:20 <steveh> eww
09:44:40 <jameson> Recursive function in the IO monad, makes sense. Thanks!
09:47:47 <shapr> mfix?
09:48:10 * shapr cackles happily about his new joke
09:52:29 <Lunar^> shapr: do rec notation !
09:52:37 <Lunar^> shapr: do rec x <- f x !
11:53:16 <jameson> shapr: Has anyone added logging to lambdabot yet?
12:20:38 <bandarra> hi
12:21:10 <bandarra> is there any way to make something like a list containing different types?
12:21:59 <Lunar^> bandarra: What are you trying to dot ?!
12:22:01 <Lunar^> -t
12:22:45 <bandarra> Lunar^: something like a mathematical domain: T1 x T2 ... x Tn, but i dont know how to make it for non limited n
12:23:06 <bandarra> i dont know if i am explaining well enough
12:23:29 <Lunar^> bandarra: If "x" means cathesian product, you use tuples to do that
12:23:44 <bandarra> Lunar^: but tuples are limited
12:23:58 <bandarra> i wanna make it without depending on "n"
12:24:10 <Lunar^> bandarra: What is T1 ?
12:24:27 <bandarra> Lunar^: some type
12:24:47 <Lor> You want a generalized product? For that you need dependent types.
12:24:50 <Lor> Not in Haskell, sorry.
12:24:55 <bandarra> Lor: :(
12:24:59 <Lunar^> bandarra: Of what ? because you can always use an inductive type to do that (data)
12:25:03 <bandarra> thanks anyway :)
12:25:08 <Lor> You might be able to simulate it with functional dependencies, though.
12:25:24 <Lor> What exactly do you want the index type to be?
12:25:27 <bandarra> Lunar^: but somrething like that has allways the same type (T1 = T2 = ... = Tn)
12:25:29 <Lor> Integers?
12:25:48 <bandarra> Lor: i had not thought in indexes
12:25:57 <Lunar^> bandarra: data Value = IntVal Int | BoolVal Bool ; then [Value] will do it
12:26:06 <Lor> So you want a product of how many different types?
12:26:24 <Lunar^> bandarra: Or you can use Dynamic's, but then you loose type checking
12:26:41 <bandarra> Lunar^: when can i find info about dynamics?
12:26:51 <bandarra> Lor: yes
12:27:00 <bandarra> Lor: of infinite types, i mean
12:27:11 <Lor> bandarra, so you want to index them by integers?
12:27:19 <Lor> What is it you are trying to do, anyway?
12:27:37 <bandarra> Lor: i need to make tables
12:27:42 <Lunar^> bandarra: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/base/Data.Dynamic.html
12:27:52 <bandarra> Lunar^: thanx i'll watch it :)
12:27:57 <Lor> Tables of what?
12:28:11 <bandarra> Lor: but i want then to have potentially infinite types and length
12:28:16 <bandarra> anything! :)
12:28:30 <bandarra> that's the question, tables of anything
12:28:42 <bandarra> T1 x T2 x ... x Tn <-- all anything
12:28:54 <Lor> Is this just some fancy idea, or do you intend to accomplish something with such a thing? If yes, then what?
12:29:27 * bandarra should have studied a little more english
12:30:48 <bandarra> Lor: i wanna look info in tables and cross them and thing like that
12:31:21 <Lor> And you cannot know the structure of these tables when you're writing the program?
12:32:04 <bandarra> Lor: not if i want them to have infinite length and any (un)knowk type
12:32:19 <Lor> You are not really making your goals clear.
12:32:30 <bandarra> 8\
12:32:45 <bandarra> well imagine a domain: T1 x T2 .. x Tn
12:32:51 <Lor> Do you want to have a single data type, which may contain a row of arbitrary length, each element of which being of an arbitrary type?
12:33:02 <bandarra> yeah
12:33:03 <bandarra> :)
12:33:10 <Lor> I know quite well what an infinite product is.
12:33:18 <Lor> What I just described is _not_ that.
12:33:36 <bandarra> well, not infinite, but not limited whenn programming it
12:34:13 <Lor> So do you want what I described? A single type, say T, with an indexing operation T -> Int -> U, where U is some "universal" type which may be analyzed to find out what kind of object it really is?
12:35:41 <bandarra> Lor: it does not have to be analyzed, i just want it to be Eq, but yes
12:37:03 <Lor> All right, you want just an array (or list) of Dynamics.
12:37:14 <Lor> Essentially, the type U^n.
12:37:28 <bandarra> :)
12:37:31 <bandarra> thanx a lot
12:37:45 <Lor> In a dependent product, the type of each row is _fixed_.
13:08:43 <shapr> jameson: no one has added logging to lambdabot, but it wouldn't be hard
13:26:18 <Darius> No one has fixed that long line bug in lambdabot, but it wouldn't be hard either.
13:26:59 <Lunar^> shapr: I was planning to make a binding for syslog
13:27:06 <Lunar^> shapr: didn't make it tough
13:29:01 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, do you mean "though" instead of "tough"?
13:29:33 <shapr> Smerdyakov: be nice, typoes happen all the time :-P
13:29:37 <shapr> oops :-)
13:29:39 <shapr> typos
13:29:54 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: And my english is really awful
13:30:05 <Cale> tpyos :)
13:30:45 <Smerdyakov> shapr, how was that not being nice?
13:30:55 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, do you know that "tough" is also an English word?
13:32:30 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: means something like "hard" right ?
13:32:49 <Smerdyakov> Lunar^, yeah.
13:32:55 <Lunar^> Smerdyakov: whereas "though" means ... cepedant in french I think
13:43:09 <mattam> cependant Lunar^ ! cep_en_dant!
13:43:15 <mattam> ;)
13:45:38 <Lunar^> mattam: oups
13:46:15 <shapr> bonjour _rubix, comment √ßa va?
13:46:26 <_rubix> bien :)
14:04:45 <andersca> shapr: <havocp> andersca: your WM should be named "WM that is butt slow because it's written in haskell" ;-) 
14:05:44 <Riastradh> I didn't know things could be 'butt' slow.
14:06:04 <shapr> well, my butt doesn't move much unless my chair is spinning, so maybe there's a useful comparison there.
14:06:21 <andersca> shapr: I'll show him *grumble*
14:06:26 <shapr> yay!
14:06:32 <Riastradh> shapr, if you're sitting on your butt, then it shouldn't be moving at alll; the _rest_ of you should be moving.
14:06:52 <shapr> er, don't you spin your chair while you're doing stuff on your computer?
14:07:25 <Riastradh> But your butt will stay in the same place: it's the centre of your rotation.
14:11:01 <shapr> argh, I'm chatting in three languages, my head is going to explode!
15:05:01 <Pseudonym> As Basil Fawlty said, "it's all bottoms with you Americans".
15:11:53 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym 
15:14:24 <blackdog> shapr: you pinching our slang? mate?
15:14:33 <shapr> blackdog: don't be a sheila ;-P
15:14:36 * shapr laughs
15:14:37 <Pseudonym> G'day.
15:14:56 <shapr> what was it? sedge hens at the barbie?
15:15:05 <shapr> grouse hens?
15:15:13 <shapr> grouse pigeons?
15:15:23 <shapr> g'day oligarca 
15:17:19 <blackdog> grouse birds.:)
15:18:28 <oligarca> hey there shapr
15:18:52 <oligarca> isn't there a log for the haskell-cafe mailing list?
15:20:34 <Darius> Yes
15:20:57 <Darius> Go to www.haskell.org and click on mailinglists and you should be able to figure your way from there
15:21:30 <oligarca> oh, here it is
15:21:47 <oligarca> thanks
21:04:22 <harsha123> helloa #haskell
21:12:38 <Townshend> Hey
21:13:30 <Townshend> I'm having some trouble compiling a program in Haskell to evaluate postfix.
21:13:43 <Townshend> Anyone available that might be able to help me out?
21:43:33 <Townshend> Anyone available that would be able to help me?
21:53:36 <dennisb> evaluate postfix?
21:53:42 <Townshend> yes
21:53:55 <Townshend> for example i'd do postfix 5 6 + and it would come back and say 11
21:54:14 <dennisb> you need to explain the problem better, and maybe someone can help. Maybe by pasting the error you get in http://paste.msunix.org/
21:55:36 <dennisb> almost nobody will say they can help before they know the problem, if they say they can and then they don't know the answer they have to admit that they couldn't. People don't like that
21:55:41 <dennisb> so, ok. I can help
21:56:09 <Townshend> http://paste.msunix.org/index.php?view=2399
21:57:02 <Townshend> the exact error I get is "Inferred type is not general enough"
21:57:37 <dennisb> does it not say where, row number, what type and so on?
21:57:50 <Townshend> ERROR "stack.hs":19 - Inferred type is not general enough
21:57:50 <Townshend> *** Expression    : post
21:57:50 <Townshend> *** Expected type : Stack a -> [(Int,Char)] -> Int
21:57:50 <Townshend> *** Inferred type : Stack Int -> [(Int,Char)] -> Int
21:58:27 <dennisb> yes, the type you gave to post is not the correct one for the implementation you have of post
21:59:11 <dennisb> post can not work with a stack for any type a
21:59:22 <dennisb> it has to be a Int-stack
21:59:29 <Townshend> so Stack Int
21:59:33 <Townshend> I've also tried that with no luck
21:59:47 <dennisb> well, thay works
21:59:52 <dennisb> that works even
22:00:36 <Townshend> Type checking
22:00:36 <Townshend> ERROR "stack.hs":19 - Instance of Fractional Int required for definition of post
22:01:08 <dennisb> if you had the type Stack a you could for example send in a String-stack, but then your function tries to push an Int onto the stack. It does not work. That function has to work with an Int stack (or fixed in some other way)
22:01:17 <dennisb> Townshend: sure, but that is another error
22:01:37 <dennisb> you can not use / on integers
22:01:37 <Townshend> i see what you're saying
22:01:53 <Townshend> really?
22:01:57 <dennisb> yes
22:01:59 <Townshend> how would one divide with integers?
22:02:05 <Townshend> or would I just have to use another type?
22:02:07 <dennisb> use integer division
22:02:17 <Townshend> im not familiar with that..
22:02:36 <dennisb> it depends on if you want to have an integer result or maybe a floating point number as the result
22:02:45 <dennisb> it's called div
22:02:58 <dennisb> Prelude> :t div
22:02:58 <dennisb> div :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
22:02:58 <dennisb> Prelude> :t (/)
22:02:58 <dennisb> (/) :: Fractional a => a -> a -> a
22:03:32 <dennisb> div works on integral types and / of fractional types, Int is an integral type (of course)
22:04:07 <Townshend> ah..i see
22:04:14 <Townshend> i got it to work..i am just using float now
22:09:34 <Townshend> thanks alot
23:51:06 <earthy> g'maen
