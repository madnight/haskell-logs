01:01:47 <Marvin--> good morning #haskell
01:02:19 <norpan> good morning
01:16:45 <emu> the result of dividing two integers is a rational number
01:24:55 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
01:27:30 <Marvin--> shapr: hejhej
01:27:53 <shapr> what have you been doing lately?
01:28:37 <Marvin--> been ill, mostly :/
01:28:44 <shapr> oh, that sucks
01:29:04 <Marvin--> spend-the-weekend-in-the-hospital-ill some three weeks ago
01:29:12 <shapr> yikes
01:29:30 <Marvin--> needless to say, I haven't gotten a lot done on my degree project lately :(
01:31:11 <Marvin--> trying to get back to it now, though
01:31:19 <Marvin--> I really want to finish this before christmas
01:43:18 <Marvin--> well, time to head to the university
01:43:26 <shapr> have fun
02:42:12 <phubuh> I just discovered how much I love flipped composition
02:42:18 <shapr> ?
02:43:23 <phubuh> I define (==>) as flip (.), and then I can do nice things like
02:43:30 <phubuh> main = getArgs >>= head ==> read ==> factorial ==> flip showHex "0123456789abcdef" ==> length ==> print
02:44:05 <phubuh> instead of using (.) and having to read the process backwards :-)
02:44:30 <shapr> I think I've seen people using .> for the same purpose
03:27:27 <shapr> @yow
03:27:28 <lambdabot> NOW, I'm taking the NEXT FLIGHT to ACAPULCO so I can write POEMS about
03:27:28 <lambdabot>  BROKEN GUITAR STRINGS and sensuous PRE-TEENS!!
03:27:38 <shapr> where's the excitement?
05:09:15 <earthy> if I read correctly
05:45:41 <earthy>       (3,'A','B'),(3, 'A', 'B') ])  
06:43:40 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: do you want to come up with a HC&A entry for Haskell Debian Users?
06:44:05 <Igloo> I think it would be a fine thing for you to come up with a HC&A entry for Haskell Debian Users, yes  :-)
06:46:11 <SyntaxPolice> OK will do :)
06:46:17 <SyntaxPolice> I'll send it to you for approval.
06:46:36 <SyntaxPolice> or maybe I'll just post it on the libraries list.
06:47:18 <SyntaxPolice> or the wiki!
06:47:19 <Igloo> http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=igloo@debian.org + hat are the packages I maintain. c2hs is the only other one that exists that isn't yours that comes to mind, although I wouldn't exactly say that was maintained  :-/
06:47:27 <Igloo> Must do something about that as it's keeping ghc5 out of testing
06:49:04 <SyntaxPolice> c2hs is keeping ghc5 out of testing?
06:49:07 <SyntaxPolice> hm
06:50:04 <Igloo> Yeah - http://bjorn.haxx.se/debian/testing.pl?package=ghc5
06:52:51 <SyntaxPolice> yuck
06:54:54 <SyntaxPolice> does it just require a new upload with the version number changed?
06:55:47 <Igloo> That would do, but there's also the matter of it technically being unbuildable, it being quite out of date and it being x86-only
06:56:03 <Igloo> ( http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=182548 )
06:56:48 <Igloo> Also http://bjorn.haxx.se/debian/testing.pl?package=c2hs
07:01:38 <Igloo> Are you interested in maintaining c2hs?
07:02:25 * Igloo will be in and out due to cooking
07:02:50 <blackdog> Sean's been hacking on it a bit, maybe you could lean on him. :)
07:03:19 <blackdog> oh wait, he's gone over to the Mac side. My bad.
07:03:32 <SyntaxPolice> Igloo: yeah, I shuld probably maintain it if we can't get sean to :)
07:05:23 <SyntaxPolice> blackdog: let sean know we're gunning for him
07:05:38 <SyntaxPolice> BTW, I woke up this morning, and on my doorstep is a can of mango juice and a note:
07:05:57 <SyntaxPolice> "To: Issac From: The mango fairy.  Have a goodone!"
07:06:09 <earthy> sweet. ;)
07:06:12 * SyntaxPolice shrus
07:06:14 <SyntaxPolice> shrugs
07:06:28 <earthy> now, the question is, who is the mango fairy. ;)
07:07:41 <SyntaxPolice> exactly.
07:07:53 <SyntaxPolice> They spelled my name wrong for one thing, so that is a big hint about who it is not.
07:09:28 <Igloo> Syn: Do you want to mail MW explaining the problem and asking if he intends to maintain it then, CCing me? Or if you prefer I'll mail CCing you?
07:10:20 <SyntaxPolice> hmm. i'm a little scared since I haven't looked at the package yet, but I'll mail him.
07:10:24 <SyntaxPolice> michaelw you mean, right?
07:10:34 <Igloo> Yup
07:10:36 <SyntaxPolice> I dont' really understand that bug report btw. is there or is there not a problem w/ the source?
07:11:20 <Igloo> I'm not sure if technically the source is at fault. If you get the tarball (or the latest one as of a little while ago) and tar -ztvf | sort | uniq -d (or whatever I mean) you'll see some files are in there twice
07:11:33 <SyntaxPolice> yeah
07:11:50 <Igloo> That could obviously be solved by retarring it up at the expense of not having pristine(sp?) source
07:12:08 <SyntaxPolice> HE has backports of nhc, right?
07:12:12 <Igloo> I'm not clear on whether tar is actually at fault, and I'm also not sure that the bug on tar shouldn't be RC if it is
07:13:00 <blackdog> SyntaxPolie: tell him? and spoil the fun?:)
07:13:16 <Igloo> Not to stable. Nor are the GHC backports up-to-date Debian-wise (although they are of 6.0.1), but the only important change has been to accomodate hmake nicely which isn't backported anyway  :-)
07:13:18 <SyntaxPolice> blackdog: maybe he'll step up and do it :)
07:13:36 <SyntaxPolice> ok
07:13:59 <Igloo> You could say more backports are planned or something
07:15:22 <earthy> tommy can you hear me?!
07:17:52 <Townshend> heh
07:18:02 <earthy> Go to the mirror boy... ;)
07:18:09 <Townshend> do you have any idea where I can find code that will evaluate a postfix expression?
07:18:29 <earthy> search the haskell wiki, I'd say
07:18:32 <Smerdyakov> That's very trivial code.
07:18:40 <Smerdyakov> It's hard for me to guess what part of it you want done for you.
07:18:52 <earthy> smerdyakov: he wants it typed out for him. :)
07:19:19 <Townshend> I don't..but I wrote one up and am having quite a bit of trouble with it
07:19:24 <Smerdyakov> The part that's specific to the idea of "evaluating a postfix expression" is very small.
07:19:37 <Smerdyakov> You just push args onto a stack and pop them off when you find operators!
07:20:30 <Townshend> yea
07:40:51 <SyntaxPolice> OK. I wrote up something quick for the HC&A.  please check it out: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/DebianUsers
07:43:28 * Igloo maintains a few more than that page says
07:44:10 <Igloo> I don't think (and lots of the packages that are already in Debian aren't very well maintained.) is true any more, at least for Haskell packages, is it?
07:52:58 <SyntaxPolice> probably not
07:53:17 <SyntaxPolice> would you like the honor of removing the comment, since you removed the problem? :)
07:53:42 <Igloo> No thanks  :-)
07:55:10 * earthy thinks it's high time to go home
08:00:20 <SyntaxPolice> bye earthy
08:02:56 <Cowgirl2> whats the command to run ghci in xemacs??
08:04:49 <Segora> rehi
08:05:26 <SyntaxPolice> Cowgirl2: m-x turn-on-haskell-ghci
08:05:32 <SyntaxPolice> m-x haskell-ghci-load-file
08:05:43 <SyntaxPolice> then after that, just m-x haskell-ghci-load-file
08:06:05 <SyntaxPolice> "m-x apropos" is your friend, by the way
08:14:25 <harsha123> hello #haskell..
08:27:45 <Cowgirl2> whats it mean when an error says - no instance for (Show 'Variable Name')     ??
08:27:53 <harsha123> hello shapr :)
08:28:59 <Smerdyakov> Cowgirl2, it doesn't know how to print your expression.
08:29:15 <Smerdyakov> Print the result of evaluating it, that is.
08:29:36 <shapr> hi harsha123 
08:29:56 <harsha123> sup shapr ?
08:30:07 <shapr> fun at the dentist
08:30:22 <Cowgirl2> ok
08:30:36 <harsha123> what happend? :)
09:35:44 <shapr> harsha123: two teeth drilled
12:16:33 <shapr> @yow
12:16:34 <lambdabot> Where do your SOCKS go when you lose them in th' WASHER?
12:16:46 <shapr> it's that time again...
12:16:51 <shapr> it's time for MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE!
12:17:24 <shapr> this message is encrypted
12:17:31 <shapr> hmm
12:18:33 <SyntaxPolice> @yow
12:18:33 <lambdabot> My polyvinyl cowboy wallet was made in Hong Kong by Montgomery Clift!
