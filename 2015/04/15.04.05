01:22:34 <browndawg> is there a standard lib function to check for divisibility?
01:22:56 <browndawg> I want to avoid writing filter (\x x `mod` something == 0)
01:27:29 <Cale> browndawg: Not really. There are libraries which define that, but not in base or whatever you probably consider standard.
01:27:43 <browndawg> Cale: yeah, I figured. 
01:27:54 <Cale> There's even
01:28:50 <browndawg> Cale: and odd, but I want to check for divisibility by other numbers :)
01:29:09 <browndawg> not too much of a pain to implement, was just asking if there's already something in the stdlib for it
01:40:18 <d3dave> http://lpaste.net/130183  is there a way to shorten this if the result entails (xs == cycle xs) and (ys == cycle ys)?
01:42:45 <d3dave> i could move the `cycle` into each definition i guess
01:55:38 <browndawg> how do I load helper functions from something like helper.hs into another file?
01:55:43 <browndawg> like I can in ghci
01:55:54 <Lis> hello everyone. i cant get this to work again http://www.mathematek.de/paste:haskell_case_io i still dont understand the meaning of that error function. is it "Your tring could be []" and that doesnt match IO? So i need to catch empty strings?
01:56:52 <pavonia> browndawg: import that helper module from your other file
01:56:58 <Cale> browndawg: Name your .hs file with a name starting with an uppercase letter (so that it is a valid module name), and add a module declaration to the top, such as  "module Helper where"  and then you should be able to  import Helper
01:57:20 <browndawg> Cale: yes, but I can't do that without creating a module, right?
01:57:25 <Lis> browndawg, https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/modules.html has a good example
01:57:26 <browndawg> I can't just mix the functions in like scheme
01:57:32 <Cale> I'm not sure what you mean
01:57:35 <browndawg> that's what I'm asking
01:57:37 <Lis> browndawg, you can then use import
01:57:47 <browndawg> well I have dog.hs with functions foo and bar
01:57:53 <Cale> importing the module will bring all the stuff defined inside it into scope
01:58:16 <browndawg> I absolutely have to wrap them up in a module, and then import the module?
01:58:22 <d3dave> Lis: whats the type of configUrlEntry?
01:58:30 <browndawg> I can simply (load "helper") in scheme
01:58:41 <Lis> d3dave, [[String]] -> String
01:58:53 <Cale> Lis: It looks like configUrlEntry xs is a String rather than an IO action
01:59:04 <Cale> Lis: right, so you can't execute that action, because it's not an action
01:59:20 <Cale> Did you simply want to define outname to be equal to configUrlEntry xs?
01:59:33 <Cale> You can write  let outname = configUrlEntry xs
01:59:50 <Lis> no i try to cope with the <- notation to understand it :D
02:00:08 <Cale> v <- x  means "execute the action x, and call its result v"
02:00:17 <Lis> so i need something like -> IO String?
02:00:31 <Cale> So, in this case, your actions are IO actions, and yeah, if x :: IO String, then v :: String will be its result
02:01:17 <Cale> You can always turn a value into an IO action which does nothing but to return that value as its result using the function  return :: a -> IO a
02:01:23 <browndawg> also, would it be a good idea to add a `divides` method to the Prelude module? Is that frowned upon in the hs community?
02:01:33 <Cale> So you *could* write  outname <- return (configUrlEntry xs)
02:01:36 <Cale> but don't do that
02:02:04 <Cale> browndawg: Good luck with that
02:02:29 <Cale> browndawg: The Prelude is really difficult to modify. It's actually very very surprising the extent to which it got changed in GHC 7.10
02:02:33 <d3dave> browndawg: i don't think `divides` is very commonly used or very useful
02:02:48 <browndawg> d3dave: Just a learning exercise.
02:02:49 <Lis> configUrlEntry :: [[String]] -> IO String configUrlEntry alist = do    url <- ((alist !! 0) !! 0)    return url      and then i get  Couldn't match type `[Char]' with `IO String' 
02:03:02 <Cale> Well, we do have gcd and lcm and div and mod and quot and rem
02:03:35 <Cale> Lis: Yeah, because alist is probably not a list of IO actions
02:03:48 <Cale> or a list of lists of IO actions, rather
02:03:53 <Cale> So the 0th element of its 0th element is probably not an IO action
02:03:58 <Cale> So you can't write url <- ...
02:04:03 <pavonia> Cale: Difficult to change in what way?
02:04:10 <Cale> pavonia: Politically
02:04:20 <Lis> ah whait, i read somewhere how to prefix IO to the list
02:04:28 <Cale> pavonia: Making changes to the Prelude means breaking lots of people's code
02:04:30 <Lis> err suffix
02:04:45 <Cale> pavonia: Even if the only reason for that is that you're bringing new stuff into scope
02:04:52 <d3dave> Cale: sure, but i think gcd and lcm f.e. should not be in the prelude, or in base for that matter, at all. they belong in a separate general math package imo
02:05:04 <pavonia> Cale: But that may happen with other modules too
02:05:13 <Cale> d3dave: I don't mind it at all
02:05:47 <Cale> pavonia: Yes.
02:06:36 <Cale> pavonia: But for a particular subset of the modules in the base package, you'll always get people complaining whenever a change is proposed.
02:08:03 <Cale> It generally takes quite a lot of campaigning and voting and such to make things happen there. There are some basic things I've wanted Data.List to include for like a decade, and while I haven't exactly pushed too hard with them, I have proposed them multiple times.
02:08:36 <Cale> and well, certain people really don't like including new stuff there
02:08:47 <Cale> Even if that's the only sensible place to put it
02:09:16 <Cale> I'm not sure I agree with d3dave on gcd.
02:10:32 <Cale> The gcd is a pretty important integer function. If we're going to include integer division and such at least, it's seems at least as important as that.
02:17:56 <tsahyt> Am I doing something wrong or is random number calculation using the random package quite slow sometimes?
02:18:05 <Cale> tsahyt: It's very slow
02:18:06 <tsahyt> s/calculation/generation
02:18:41 <tsahyt> Is there a faster way to get numbers that look random?
02:26:50 <f|`-`|f> mersene twister
02:27:04 <f|`-`|f> I've been to wikipedia recently
02:27:53 <f|`-`|f> COuld do uh something based on that modulo one
02:28:03 <f|`-`|f> linear modulo number gen
02:28:51 <Saizan> there are some packages on hackage with faster random number generators, i don't remember the names though..
02:28:57 <f|`-`|f> it's where you take the mmodulo of step_amount * steps + seed number
02:29:18 <f|`-`|f> the issue is that it breaks down on hyperplane analysis
02:29:33 <Saizan> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mwc-random <- i guess this is one
02:31:09 <tsahyt> f|`-`|f: I thought that System.Random did exactly this?
02:31:25 <tsahyt> Saizan: That could possibly, work. I'll give it a shot, thanks!
02:31:38 <f|`-`|f> oh god dammit
02:31:55 <f|`-`|f> it's fast though
02:32:28 <f|`-`|f> though how the hell does it determine the steps, modulus, and step amount from one state value?
02:33:24 <Cale> f|`-`|f: Not sure what you're asking there
02:34:20 <Cale> tsahyt: I really like tf-random, but it's probably not what you're looking for, as I believe it's slightly slower than System.Random, but on the other hand, its random numbers are very high quality
02:35:43 <Cale> A problem with System.Random is that while it implements the "split" function for splitting a random generator state into two new ones, when you do this repeatedly, the resulting generators eventually become highly correlated.
02:36:17 <Cale> tf-random is based on the threefish block cipher and avoids that problem
02:36:23 <tsahyt> Cale: I'm sampling points on a hemisphere for an ambient occlusion algorithm. For high quality results I need several hundred random samples per pixel, so performance trumps pretty much everything else here.
02:36:42 <Cale> Yeah, for things like that, you don't likely care too much about quality
02:36:53 <solatis> Cale, i always get scared when i see home-grown implementations of crypto algos... :/
02:37:07 <tsahyt> Exactly. As long as it's roughly uniform, it'll work. I just found this                                       
02:37:10 <tsahyt> ╰─>$ cabal build
02:37:17 <tsahyt> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xorshift
02:37:24 <tsahyt> Sorry, wrong thing in clipboard.
02:37:31 <Cale> solatis: tf-random doesn't claim to be cryptographically secure
02:37:44 <solatis> ah
02:37:51 <solatis> i misintepreted that
02:37:55 <Cale> solatis: It just uses the results about threefish to be able to prove something about the quality of the randomness that it generates.
02:37:58 <f|`-`|f> hm, xorshift
02:38:06 <tsahyt> I think it won't get any faster than a few xors and a few shifts. I'll try that. It also comes with a RandomGen instance, so I don't have to rewrite anything.
02:38:08 <solatis> i understand
02:39:05 <solatis> "Please note that even though the generator provides very high-quality pseudorandom numbers, it has not been designed with cryptographic applications in mind."
02:39:10 <solatis> i am happy that it says that :)
02:41:02 <tsahyt> I still think that implementing your own crypto is fine, unless you intend to distribute it or use it in any application. It's nice for learning.
02:44:03 <tsahyt> Hooray for incomplete instances... damnit.

02:48:25 <Cale> shachaf: haha
02:48:47 <tsahyt> Well xorshift is a bit faster but I still use 60% of the time for random number generation. That's hardly satisfying...

02:50:54 <Cale> ?
02:53:02 <d3dave> how can i debug a cyclical data structure easily?
02:54:19 <tsahyt> Cale: Not yet. As far as I can see there's no RandomGen instance there, so I tried something that didn't require rewriting anything before trying mwc-random.

02:54:23 <Cale> d3dave: It can be kind of tricky, given that they're ordinarily indistinguishable from infinite data structures.
02:54:40 <Cale> d3dave: What sort of cyclic data structure?
02:54:44 <tsahyt> But honestly I can't see anything getting faster than 3 xors and 3 shifts.
02:54:53 <d3dave> Cale: it
02:55:37 <d3dave> Cale: it's a list of vertices, and a list of edges, where each vertex has 2 neighboring edges and each edge has the 2 vertices it connects
02:56:30 <d3dave> and it's closed, like a polygon
02:56:36 <Cale> d3dave: Usually when representing graph structures, I find it most convenient to use a representation based on maps and sets.
02:56:42 <d3dave> so the last vertex connects to the first
02:57:52 <Cale> Like, in your case, since you definitely have two neighbours for each vertex, you could perhaps use Map Vertex (Vertex, Vertex)
02:58:19 <d3dave> yea, im gonna try that now
02:58:26 <d3dave> thanks
02:59:20 <f|`-`|f> So the only possible cycles is along the supposed ends of the graph
02:59:53 <d3dave> well the graph is strictly a circle

03:02:41 <ddellacosta> I'm trying to playing with Data.Array.ST in ghci, but I can't get past "The type variables ‘m0’, ‘a0’ are ambiguous" regarding MArray when calling newArray...what do I have to do to specify this in an interactive session?  This code compiles fine when saved to a file, btw.
03:04:09 <jle`> ddellacosta: how are you using newArray ?
03:04:15 <tsahyt> I've noticed that the profiling output also says that the random number generation takes (comparatively) a lot of memory. Could this also be a laziness problem?
03:04:39 <jle`> if you're pre-7.8, does turning off the monomorphism restriction help?
03:05:16 <ddellacosta> jle`: in a do block-- like do { a <- newArray (0, n) False;  ... }
03:05:20 <ddellacosta> jle`: I'm 7.8.3
03:05:37 <jle`> are you binding it to a value using `let` ..?
03:05:48 <ddellacosta> jle`: oh, that works fine...I guess the problem is printing
03:06:07 <jle`> you're using runST, right?
03:07:18 <ddellacosta> um, no, and actually now that you mention it that's what I'm *not* using from the code in the file that *does* compile
03:07:28 <ddellacosta> jle`: I guess I didn't realize that was necessary
03:07:44 <jle`> well you get an `ST a`, right?
03:07:49 <d3dave> found the issue; the edge connections are shifted by 1
03:07:54 <jle`> er, `ST w a`
03:08:03 <d3dave> as in 1 vertex left/right
03:08:13 <jle`> which isn't something you'd print; you wouldn't print `IO a`, for instance :)
03:08:17 <randir> How should I generate a stream of digits in Pi?
03:08:56 <Cale> http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf has some Haskell code for the infinite list of digits of pi
03:09:02 <ddellacosta> jle`: hmm, well, I'm processing it and getting an MArray a Bool m back...
03:09:18 <ddellacosta> jle`: er, sorry, that is a constraint -- I get m (a i Bool)
03:09:22 <Cale> (including a very obfuscated and minimised version)
03:09:32 <ddellacosta> er, m (a Int Bool) rather
03:09:53 <tsahyt> Can I pass ghc flags to cabal somehow?
03:09:57 <Cale> Note that near the end, there's a faster version than the one given in the beginning
03:09:59 <jle`> ddellacosta: yeah, you want an Array you can print
03:10:04 <ddellacosta> jle`: but yeah, now that I'm starting to actually think about the type signatures instead of flailing around, I see some mistakes I'm making...thanks for pointing me in the right direction. :-)
03:10:05 <randir> Cale: awesome, thanks
03:10:10 <jle`> m (a ...) gives you instructions for creating the Array
03:10:16 <ddellacosta> right
03:10:21 <jle`> valid instances for `m are IO and ST w
03:10:25 <randir> Looks like an intriguing paper
03:10:31 <jle`> so you can just use <- in ghci to get something out of it :)
03:10:41 <ddellacosta> jle`: gotcha, thank you!
03:10:52 <randir> I can't wait to graduate this semester and actually start learning some Math. Have a cool book on category theory I want to work through. 
03:10:53 <jle`> or you can use runSt
03:10:59 <jle`> *runST
03:11:24 <jle`> but i think you can only runST/IO when you are producting/returining an immutable
03:12:15 <ddellacosta> jle`: right, that's what it says in the docs for runSTArray at least
03:14:57 <ddellacosta> jle`: okay, I have to ask you about something you said above: you said I could use "<-" ("draw from," as used in do notation, right?) inside of ghci
03:15:13 <ddellacosta> jle`: but I have to admit I'm not sure how I do that, other than inside a do block inside of ghci...or is that what you meant
03:15:15 <ddellacosta> jle`: ?
03:15:26 <tsahyt> Is it possible to create a cost center for a library function (randomRs)?
03:15:44 <jle`> it depends on how polymorphic your actual `m` is
03:16:00 <jle`> my memory was a little fuzzy on Array's interface
03:17:55 <jle`> for Data.Array.MArray, there are a list of instances/combinations you can use your m (...) as
03:18:01 <ddellacosta> jle`: I mean, I was able to simply wrap the whole thing in runSTArray and that did the work of converting the MArray to normal immutable Array, but I was just curious what you meant by that--I'm not even sure syntactically how to use "<-" outside of a do block in ghci, if that is a thing that is feasible
03:18:24 <ddellacosta> but I'm guessing I misunderstood
03:18:46 <jle`> using <- at top level ghci is like executing an IO action and binding the result
03:19:02 <jle`> like str <- readFile "foo.txt"
03:19:20 <ddellacosta> jle`: ah, I just tried it with getLine, I see!
03:19:38 <jle`> `newArray` is polymorphic enough that you can have be IO (IOArray Int e)
03:19:44 <ddellacosta> jle`: wow thanks, I never put 2-and-2 together there, even though I remembered reading way back that ghci is like being inside a do block
03:19:49 <jle`> for Data.Array.MArray at least
03:20:04 <ddellacosta> jle`: ah okay, then that's why my simple attempt didn't work
03:20:34 <jle`> x <- newArray (0,10) 0 :: IO (IOArray Int IO)
03:20:46 <jle`> will give you a mutable array bound to `x` you can manipulate using IO
03:21:07 <ddellacosta> jle`: aha, so I have to constrain the type when I call newArray
03:21:16 <ddellacosta> jle`: to IO?
03:21:17 <jle`> well, usually in code, the compiler can infer
03:21:29 <ddellacosta> jle`: (I mean in ghci?)
03:21:34 <jle`> in this case <- will infer it to be IO actually, so...it should be ok
03:21:37 <jle`> let me try
03:22:05 <jle`> hm you still have to specify a type signature because you need to say if you want an IOArray or an IOUArray
03:23:28 <jle`> (boxed or unboxed)
03:23:33 <jle`> sorry, x <- IO (IOArray Int Int)
03:23:55 <jle`> newArray :: IO (IOArray Int Int), that is
03:24:03 <jle`> ...you know what i mean :)
03:24:12 <jle`> newArray is polymorphic enough to work for both IO and ST
03:25:05 <ddellacosta> jle`: got it, thanks--that was helpful both in terms of using ghci and for grokking the type signatures more fully. :-)
03:25:17 <jle`> if you want to use it in ST then newArray is xs :: ST s (STArray s Int Int), for example
03:25:21 <jle`> np!
03:25:38 <jle`> the big list of instances for MArray should tell you every situation where you can have newArray infer to
03:26:48 <ddellacosta> jle`: talking about the instances list here, right? https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.0.0/docs/Data-Array-MArray.html
03:27:00 <jle`> mhm
03:27:03 <ddellacosta> at bottom of MArray section
03:27:14 <ddellacosta> okay, got it
03:27:19 <jle`> you sort of have to mentally play match-the-position with the list of intsances though
03:27:38 <ddellacosta> sorry, what do you mean by that jle`?
03:27:45 <jle`> MArray IOArray e IO means a = IOArray, e = e, m = IO in newArray :: (i, i) -> e -> m (a i e)
03:27:54 <jle`> the a is IOArray, the e is e, and the m is IO
03:28:02 <ddellacosta> oh, right, gotcha
03:30:42 <tsahyt> Turns out that it's not the generator itself that's slow, it's the stuff around it that converts the random bytes to Float within a given range.
03:31:06 <tsahyt> Just removing the range restriction cuts generation time in half.

03:46:39 <phaazon> oh
03:46:44 <phaazon> the problem is m
03:46:48 <Cale> Because dep is polymorphic in a way which can't be determined by r
03:46:49 <Cale> yes
03:46:56 <phaazon> dammit :D
03:47:13 <Cale> Maybe you want  r m -> dep
03:47:29 <Cale> i.e. once both are known, then dep should be known
03:47:43 <phaazon> yeah but I’m not sure it’s the right thing I want
03:49:14 <phaazon> ok, I’ll go fr m r -> dep
03:49:27 <phaazon> thank you very much Cale 
03:49:36 <Cale> no problem
03:50:06 <phaazon> I’m not sure the whole thing is correct though
03:50:10 <phaazon> it’s very experimental
03:50:18 <phaazon> I’m looking for a good way to introduce resource managing
03:50:42 <phaazon> that is, being able to load a request for a resource; if it’s the first request for that resource, load it; otherwise, use the cache 
03:51:03 <phaazon> resources can have dependencies
03:51:13 <phaazon> and I’d like to be able to “map” over managers
03:51:15 <phaazon> like
03:51:29 <phaazon> Manager a b -> (b -> m c) -> m (Manager a c)
03:51:32 <phaazon> some kind of traversal
03:51:40 <phaazon> so that I can change resources without changing keys
03:53:19 <phaazon> in my case
03:53:38 <phaazon> a Manager is just a pair of function (retrieve / release) over an IORef (Map String r)
03:53:58 <phaazon> changing r with that is a bit hard though
04:17:23 <niklasb> hi, can somebody give me a quick overview of the current state of safe haskell in 7.8? is it safe? I know it used to have problems in the past, i.e. type extensions were broken and allowed to infer stuff like forall a b. a -> b

04:30:35 <rtpg> anyone know how to get table layout formatting for emacs?
04:30:44 <rtpg> like, getting your code so that the equals line up?

04:32:50 <niklasb> haha
04:33:13 <LarryCroft> Heyho
04:33:52 <niklasb> mpickering: so I guess you can just use that to get yourself an unsafePerformIO and all is lost:
04:33:54 <niklasb> ?
04:34:45 <mpickering> well unsafeCoerce does something different to unsafePerformIO I think?
04:35:47 <LarryCroft> What do you guys recommend when I want to combine f :: a -> m a and g :: a -> a? g <$> (x >>= f) does not look too good in my eyes :-/
04:36:18 <LarryCroft> I'd be happy with something that goes strictly from left to right (or right to left)
04:36:20 <niklasb> LarryCroft: f >>= (g . f)?
04:36:26 <niklasb> aeh
04:36:54 <niklasb> x >>= f >>= return . g
04:37:02 <LarryCroft> Ah
04:37:07 <LarryCroft> That's great =)
04:37:12 <LarryCroft> Thank you!
04:47:45 <niklasb> mpickering: sure, but I guess you can use something similar to http://lpaste.net/74498, depending on what the current internal representation of IO is in ghc

05:05:23 <Ippo> hello
05:07:12 <ippo__> I'm having some issues with cabal-install: I can't install anything, the program hangs and I can't install any package. I already tried removing and reinstalling the whole platform, both 32 and 64 bit, with no luck.
05:08:13 <ippo__> apparently it gets stuck during compilation
05:08:17 <ippo__> anyone has encountered this before?
05:09:12 <niklasb> which package ippo__?
05:09:21 <niklasb> oh nvm
05:09:38 <ippo__> niklasb: indifferent. It happens with cabal-install, zip-archive, digest, http-conduit... you name it.
05:10:40 <ippo__> right now I'm trying to install zip-archive, and the process gets stuck while compiling digest
05:11:08 <ippo__> conemu tells me that it launches hsc2hs.exe, and it never moves from there, so I'm guessing the issue is with that process
05:12:13 <ippo__> I'm on windows 8.1, 64bit. I think it might have something to do with it, since the other pc (win7 32bit) has no issues
05:15:36 <gelisam> I've had issues with hsc2hs as well, but it crashed instead of hanging: http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/2zx79u/having_problems_installing_snap_using_cabal_on/cpn4v2q

05:35:14 <Lis> it's the last error remaining. finally
05:35:28 <Lis> and map return fixed it
05:35:30 <Lis> thank you

05:50:01 <Lis> whats the best string replace library for haskell? missingh?
05:52:23 <hpc> not sure, actually; string replacement isn't needed that often in haskell
05:52:41 <hpc> depending on what you're doing, what you usually end up doing is parsing your string out to some data structure and manipulating that directly
05:52:59 <brbblnch> Hi
05:54:47 <brbblnch> As far as I know, in Gentzen's natural deduction (with labels for each hypothesis) when you do "implication introduction", you can kill any number of alive hypothesis' (0 or more). How does that translate to the lambda abstraction with Curry Howard?

06:35:52 <thereisnoquarter> so im getting back into haskell
06:35:55 <thereisnoquarter> going back to the basics
06:36:06 <thereisnoquarter> working on brent yorgey's CIS194 class, trying to write a function "skip"
06:36:32 <thereisnoquarter> it takes a list, and gives back a list of lists. the first item is the original list, the second item is every other item in the original list ... the nth item is every nth item in the original list
06:36:49 <thereisnoquarter> can anyone give me a hint? i'm really struggling and im not sure why. out of practice with the haskell way of thinking.
06:38:57 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: well, first write a function that given n and a list, returns every n-th item of a list.
06:39:32 <int-e> @type drop -- might come in handy
06:39:33 <lambdabot> Int -> [a] -> [a]
06:39:49 <int-e> > drop 2 [1..5]
06:39:50 <lambdabot>  [3,4,5]
06:39:59 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: i did that
06:42:04 <gelisam> brbblnch, which proposition is proved when you eliminate a number of hypotheses other than one? Is it always $A => B$, or is it more complicated propositions such as $A1 => A2 => B$ or $A1 /\ A2 => B$?
06:42:05 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: the problem is the iteration
06:42:11 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: is the function supposed to return a finite list (say [1,2,3] |-> [[1,2,3],[2],[3]] or an infinite one (with many empty lists in the end)?
06:42:28 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: the first case. and the output should be the same length as the original list
06:42:41 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: which is obvious from the problem definition
06:43:37 <brbblnch> gelisam: Well, it should always be $A => B$. (note that i'm not /sure/ of anything)
06:43:45 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: mathematically, no it's not. if I take every 10th item from [1], then I get [].
06:44:32 * hackagebot HoleyMonoid 0.1.1 - Monoids with holes.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HoleyMonoid-0.1.1 (MartijnVanSteenbergen)
06:45:04 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: what do you mean? n runs from 1 to the length of the list. so the first item from [1] is [1], so the output is [[1]]
06:45:11 <brbblnch> gelisam: I'm working with these www.paultaylor.eu/stable/prot.pdf , www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/lambdanotes.pdf
06:45:45 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: i probably stated it in an unclear way.
06:45:49 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: Ok, there is a very easy way to do what you want with map (or a list comprehension), your helper function, and a range [1..something]. This will have the downside that it isn't lazy.
06:46:10 <brbblnch> gelisam: In the first, it is explicitly said that you can kill any number of hypothesis' . In the second, it seems to be that you *have* to always remove one (which pretty much resolves the problem but adds another one)
06:46:10 <gelisam> brbblnch: then it sounds like the corresponding term should be $\x^A.u$ in all cases, and that occurrences of $x$ inside $u$ would correspond to the eliminated hypotheses. So if zero hypotheses are eliminated, $x$ is simply not used in the body of the lambda
06:46:47 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: but for map, for example, dont i need to know where the item occurs in the list?
06:47:42 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: no, since you're not going to map over the given list.
06:48:03 <thereisnoquarter> int-e: hm.
06:48:36 <int-e> thereisnoquarter: you should map over the range of n, following the problem description
06:50:17 <brbblnch> gelisam: Yeah, that's what I thought. But then, given a proof of $A=>B$, there is no "unique" way to get a lambda term for it.
06:51:01 <gelisam> brbblnch: why not?
06:51:21 <brbblnch> gelisam: Assuming you killed hypothesis $x,y,z$ of type $A$ to get $A=>B$, valid terms would be $\x^A:u$ or $\y^A:u$ but also $\w^A:u$ where you didn't even have $w$ as hypothesis, right ?
06:52:43 <gelisam> brbblnch: you can kill more than one hypotheses at once even if they have different names?
06:52:43 <brbblnch> gelisam: If you have the rule "To get an implication, you need to kill one (no more, no less) hypothesis", then it's easy to get the corresponding abstraction variable. But otherwise there isn't as much clarity to it, it seems
06:54:42 <brbblnch> gelisam: As far as I know, you can.
06:57:40 <gelisam> brbblnch: then maybe you're not supposed to use any of their names as the lambda's parameter name, but instead to use a fresh variable name, and then in the body of the lambda you use that fresh variable name to represent the hypotheses you have killed instead of using their original names?
06:58:54 <noteventime> thereisnoquarter: Try writing a function that includes only every n:th value of a list (without worrying about solving "for every n:th" value for every n=1..length-of-list)

09:04:23 <lambdabot> flip (flip if' (evaluate a) . (0 /=) . number) (evaluate b)

09:05:16 <lambdabot> evaluate . flip (flip if' a . (0 /=) . number) b
09:06:12 <kazagistar> dicioccio: that looks a lot like State, just more constrained?
09:06:28 <mpickering> dicioccio: It's in machines as Mealy
09:06:36 <dicioccio> thanks :)
09:08:02 <mpickering> also the "auto" package provides something quite similiar 
09:08:13 <mpickering> (and much better docs)
09:08:14 <c_wraith> the type in auto is way more complicated internally
09:08:25 <c_wraith> But you can mostly ignore that. :)
09:09:50 <dicioccio> for the context, I was building a sentence-generator to transform list of random values to list of words, following transition probabilities (i.e., Foo a b -> [a] -> [b])
09:10:22 <dicioccio> and yes, Mealy is exactly it, thanks kazagistar and mpickering  :)
09:10:51 <kazagistar> <-- actually did nothing, but you're welcome
09:14:51 <Stratege> does anyone know a good IDE for Haskell, if such a thing exists? :)
09:15:28 <ackthet> Stratege: do you use vim? i saw a good page on how to set up vim as a haskell ide
09:15:33 <ackthet> i could link that
09:15:39 <edcompsci> Vim is awesome!
09:15:59 <Stratege> don't use vim, but would be willing to give it a shot if it can be made into a good haskell ide, please link the page :)
09:16:06 <ackthet> there is this
09:16:08 <ackthet> https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now
09:16:10 <ackthet> and
09:16:16 <ackthet> http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_haskell.html
09:16:21 <bernalex> Stratege: what do you really mean by IDE? IDE is not a very useful term, as people like different things about IDEs.
09:16:28 <valdyn> Stratege: vim + hdevtools + syntastic, might be in your distro
09:16:45 <Buttons840> replicateA n a = sequence $ replicate n a works as expected, but replicateA = sequence . replicate does not compile ? (doing the NICTA course)
09:16:54 <Stratege> valdyn bad time to mention I'm running windows? ;)
09:17:22 <edcompsci> I'm interested in picking functional programming, and I want to start with haskell.... I haven't been able to find any examples, but is haskell good for image processing?
09:18:07 <valdyn> Stratege: since i was not going to walk you through installing it, makes no difference
09:18:10 <Stratege> bernalex tab completion for function names, ability to jump to function definitions, syntax highlighting, compile button, perhaps integrated repl, visual debugger - my ideas of an IDE are mostly influenced by VS.
09:18:10 <ackthet> edcompsci: if you do decide to learn haskell, i recommend #haskell-beginners 
09:18:42 <ackthet> Stratege: maybe virtulize linux in windows?
09:19:16 <Stratege> eh, there are easier solutions, but yeah, I'll figure something out for getting vim running, thanks for the links.
09:19:30 <ackthet> np
09:21:58 <johnchen902> @pl (\(lookup, result) -> put (insert a b' lookup, result))
09:21:58 <lambdabot> uncurry ((put .) . (,) . insert a b')
09:22:23 <dicioccio> edcompsci: you can have a look at what people made with the "repa" or "friday" libraries but I would not call it "easy for beginners" 
09:22:38 <dicioccio> edcompsci: https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday
09:23:26 <Ainieco> hello
09:24:31 <Ainieco> i'd like to create rpc client/server in haskell, which library is most convenient and ideomatic out there?
09:25:51 <dicioccio> Ainieco: what is your goal? learn a bit of networked applications?
09:26:05 <dicioccio> because you may want to start with a good-old HTTP server
09:31:28 <bernalex> how is 'autocmd BufEnter *.hs set formatprg=pointfree' supposed to work?
09:31:38 <Ainieco> dicioccio: no, port couple of production services to haskell
09:32:06 <bernalex> I tried highlighting the line 'clac o es = f o . sa $ es' and doing gq, but it just replaces my expression with pointfree output as if I invoked it without arguments (i.e. pointfree -h).
09:39:52 <dicioccio> Ainieco: I tend to like courier/cloud-haskell but it's more than just RPC
09:44:55 <Ainieco> dicioccio: thanks, will look at those

10:02:11 <hexagoxel> if you want a completely useless tool, you can add unsafeCoerce to djinn's environment :D
10:02:24 <aruro> what it will do? :)
10:02:28 <Stratege> ruin everything
10:02:34 <Stratege> unsafeCoerce :: a -> b
10:02:41 <aruro> aa
10:02:51 <sammecs> :D
10:03:02 <ReinH> aruro: If you want to experiment with lambdabot, you can /msg it directly
10:03:10 <aruro> i know ty :)
10:03:24 <aruro> channel was empty i though people may enjoy :)
10:03:28 <Stratege> transforms one arbitrary type into another and is usually a terrible terrible idea. ^^
10:03:47 <aruro> what if its not arbitrary?
10:04:35 <mniip> aruro, 'a' is an arbitrary type
10:05:07 <aruro> yes my mistake
10:05:23 <ownclo> @pl \a b -> (f a b,  g a b)
10:05:23 <lambdabot> ap (ap . ((,) .) . f) g
10:05:37 <Stratege> If you have specific types in mind then the chance is good that there's a better conversion function. And if not you should carefully read how unsafeCoerce works before using it and then still not use it.
10:05:46 <aruro> ownclo this function is too complicated to be usefull as pointless
10:06:04 <aruro> :)
10:06:15 <aruro> im reading about functional dependencies 
10:06:22 <aruro> it is kinda like that :)
10:06:25 <aruro> almost

10:07:39 <aruro> it is used in multiparametric classes
10:07:47 <aruro> to typecheck better
10:07:52 <ownclo> aruro, I see) I thought of something simpler than that, like 'f &&& g'
10:07:57 <aruro> or better to say to infer types
10:08:15 <aruro> yeah pointless is cool only when its beautiful :)
10:08:22 <aruro> in my opinion
10:08:41 <ownclo> I definitely won't use that one :)

10:33:16 <Athas> Is there a tool that can look at the names exported by the modules of my Cabal project, and list the ones that are not used anywhere?

10:34:04 <Zemyla> You know, Coyoneda looks like a frigging magic trick to me.
10:34:06 <athan> Athas: Maybe cabal-lens :S
10:34:22 <athan> Zemyla: No way! It's just a functorial thunk or something!
10:34:44 * hackagebot nested-routes 0.0.1.1 - Like scotty, but nested  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nested-routes-0.0.1.1 (athanclark)
10:35:08 <Zemyla> I mean, here you have a functor, a list or tree or whatever, filled with opaque indistinguishable black boxes.
10:35:39 <Zemyla> But look! With this magic decoder ring, you can see all the stuff that's inside!
10:38:12 * athan shrugs
10:38:14 <athan> I still don't get it Zemyla :\
10:40:31 <Athas> athan: well, that's a good starting point to building such a tool, I guess.
10:40:52 <athan> Athas: I really want to make decent querying for Cabal :\
10:41:10 <athan> including automatic version constraint / API adherance, but I still got a way to go
10:42:14 <Athas> I'm nowhere near as ambitious - I basically just want some specific development tools.
10:42:29 <Athas> Nicer ways to graph module dependencies would also be nice, to reveal tight coupling.
10:42:52 <Zemyla> athan: Basically, Coyoneda f a = forall r. Coyoneda (r -> a) (f r).
10:43:48 <Athas> athan: are you working on anything specific in that direction?
10:43:52 <Zemyla> It is equivalent to f a, but if you only have the second element, you can't inspect the contents.
10:44:04 <athan> Athas: Hmm, I like that idea too :) I'll whip something together soon, feel free to ping me or something and I'll add it to the dusty scrap heap - https://github.com/athanclark/cabal-utils
10:44:19 <athan> Athas: Right now, a nicer opt-parse library
10:44:24 <Athas> Oh, nice, I will definitely take a look at that.
10:44:29 <athan> because this is going to be a complex command, like git
10:44:42 <Zemyla> Like, if f were [], you could find the length of the second element, but not sum up the elements, because you don't know the type.
10:44:46 <athan> Athas: Yeah, feel free to pollute it with `Notes.md` files or something :)
10:45:02 <Athas> Well, I'd advice you to create different programs for different tasks, but it's your work, so.
10:45:13 <athan> Zemyla: Oh wow!!
10:45:33 <athan> yeah I think I'm starting get it, it's a bit rought atm
10:45:42 <athan> loop school has some wonderful videos
10:45:42 <Zemyla> But unCoyoneda (Coyoneda fn fu) = fmap fn fu gives you the original functor back.
10:45:54 <athan> Athas: Yep - optparse-nested is my next step
10:45:58 <Zemyla> It's like a magic trick.
10:46:14 <athan> Zemyla: Ahh because the r's unify! brilliant!!
10:46:31 <monochrom> this is the joy of existential types
10:47:37 <athan> monochrom: Yeah I feel like a dingbat - I never thought of coupling destructors with an existential constructor
10:49:45 <no_gravity> hello! how do you write this in haskell? "x=0 or 1; print x;" ?
10:50:05 <monochrom> what does that code mean?
10:50:08 <Welkin> no_gravity: what does that mean?
10:50:13 <monochrom> explain to me like I don't know what you mean
10:50:24 <no_gravity> well, im trying to see what it outputs in different languages.
10:50:38 <no_gravity> in php,perl and ruby it outputs 0. in pythin it outputs 1.
10:50:40 <Stratege> what is the "or" there supposed to do?
10:51:03 <monochrom> it outputs a "syntax error" message in Haskell. are you happy now?
10:51:34 <monochrom> or when are you ready to reveal what your meaning is?
10:51:44 <no_gravity> about the or operator?
10:51:54 <Stratege> and if one were to adjust the syntax, it'd give you a type error, because or in haskell is defined on bools and 0 and 1 are numbers.
10:51:56 <monochrom> that's for starters, sure.
10:52:14 <Stratege> :t or
10:52:15 <lambdabot> Foldable t => t Bool -> Bool
10:52:25 <no_gravity> well, to begin .. how do you put something into a variable in haskell and output it?
10:52:35 <Stratege> oh, FTP has gone through? neat
10:52:57 <monochrom> to put somthing into a variable, then output it anyway: output that something directly, skip the useless variable.
10:53:30 <no_gravity> well.. i think i will leave haskell off this comparison.
10:53:43 <monochrom> I do that in every language, too. from BASIC to Prolog
10:54:15 <Athas> no_gravity: "0 or 1" does not really make sense.
10:54:19 <aruro> indeed
10:54:29 <aruro> im hesitating to ask :D but you did it first
10:54:34 <monochrom> it's the whole point of Fortran
10:54:45 * hackagebot cabal-debian 4.26 - Create a Debianization for a Cabal package  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-debian-4.26 (DavidFox)
10:54:49 <no_gravity> well, im making a comparison how different languages handle it.
10:55:02 <no_gravity> here is php: http://codepad.org/JvfoKATO
10:55:07 <ReinH> no_gravity: Other languages let you treat numbers as booleans. Haskell doesn't.
10:55:11 <ReinH> So there's no comparison.
10:55:11 <monochrom> instead of "tmp1 = 1+2; tmp2 = tmp1 + 3; print tmp2", why don't you simply "print (1+2+3)"?
10:55:21 <Athas> How they handle what?  I mean, you could write this in Haskell:
10:55:21 <Athas> do let x = if p then 0 else 1
10:55:22 <Athas>    print x
10:55:37 <no_gravity> there is no or operator?
10:55:39 <monochrom> print (if p then 0 else 1)
10:55:47 <Athas> Yes, there is, but it works on booleans, not numbers.
10:55:55 <aruro> somebody tell me what is x = 1 or 2 :)
10:55:56 <Zemyla> :t length
10:55:57 <lambdabot> Foldable t => t a -> Int
10:56:00 <no_gravity> i would be fine with booleans too
10:56:01 <Athas> Haskell does not implicitly coerce numbers to booleans.
10:56:06 <ReinH> no_gravity: There isn't an operator that lets you treat numbers as booleans, of any name
10:56:20 <Athas> Well:
10:56:20 <Athas> do let x = False || True
10:56:21 <Athas>    print x
10:56:24 <Athas> But it is a really weird thing to write.
10:56:34 <monochrom> print (False || True)
10:56:36 <no_gravity> i wonder if you really don't understand me :)
10:56:47 <aruro> bitwise or?
10:56:47 <no_gravity> it's about parameter precedence.
10:56:58 <ReinH> no_gravity: you want a haskell equivalent of x = 0 or 1. There is none.
10:56:59 <hjulle> Can I import a module in the current working directory in ghci? ":m + ModuleName" doesn't seem to work.
10:57:03 <no_gravity> some languages have "=" before "or" and some after.
10:57:07 <Athas> Ah, well, in Haskell, variable binding is not an operator.
10:57:08 <no_gravity> im making a list.
10:57:10 <Zemyla> @let isTrue a = a /= 0
10:57:12 <lambdabot>  Defined.
10:57:14 <ReinH> no_gravity: = is not an operator.
10:57:15 <Athas> So there is no priority issue - it makes no sense.
10:57:20 <aruro> hjulle use :l
10:57:20 <monochrom> why do people trash the contribution of Fortran? who do people insist on inserting a middleman intermediate variable that contributes nothing?
10:57:20 <Zemyla> :t isTrue
10:57:21 <lambdabot> (Eq a, Num a) => a -> Bool
10:57:47 <Athas> monochrom: naming an intermediate result can aid readability.
10:58:08 <Zemyla> monochrom: You're right. isTrue = (0 /=)
10:58:10 <no_gravity> well, i leave haskell out. probably some reader will code the line up in haskell.
10:58:13 <hjulle> aruro: Can I load multiple files using ":l"? I want to import stuff from several modules.
10:58:23 <aruro> use :m+
10:58:25 <aruro> i think
10:58:51 <aruro> did you installe those modules with cabal?
10:58:53 <Athas> no_gravity: nobody will, because Haskell does not have an assignment operator.
10:58:57 <aruro> then ghci should find them
10:59:33 <aruro> somebody tell me what x = 0 or 1 is :D
10:59:42 <aruro> it is 1 or 0? :)
10:59:46 <hjulle> aruro, No, they just sit there in my working dir. I am currently messing with them. Importing between them is no problem.
11:00:04 <c_wraith> I'm having trouble with the liquid haskell tutorial, when it starts using ==> in values..  It's not defined.  Am I missing an import?
11:00:05 <Athas> aruro: it typically means 'define a variable x whose value is the result of the expression "0 or 1"'.
11:00:15 <aruro> ok
11:00:24 <aruro> ty
11:00:29 <Athas> But it might also mean 'evaluate the expression "(x = 0) or 1"'.
11:00:29 <nocturne777> I see that "Monad ((->) r)"  works the same the same as "Reader"
11:00:31 <ProofTechnique> hjulle: You could create a module that just re-exports all your other modules and load that in GHCi
11:00:38 <nocturne777> which one people usually prefer?
11:00:47 <Athas> nocturne777: Reader.
11:00:58 <monochrom> seriously, my first interpretation of "0 or 1" is nondeterministic choice
11:00:59 <Athas> It's easier on the eyes and communicates intent more clearly.
11:01:01 <nocturne777> Wrapping it in "Reader" makes it explicit that Reader Monad is used
11:01:27 <aruro> hjulle just add your directory to the path
11:01:30 <monochrom> because I once saw that a Perl library or something that did that
11:01:47 <hjulle> ProofTechnique, Ok, thanks, that's good enough. But I'm surprised that I can't load/import several modules.
11:01:55 <aruro> you can
11:01:58 <aruro> if they are in path
11:02:11 <aruro> then they will show up like  prelude+somthi+somth
11:02:18 <aruro> next to cursor
11:02:27 <hjulle> aruro, I've tried "ghci -i.", but :m still doesn't find the module.
11:02:50 <aruro> try it with standard modules as a proof of concept that you can load two or more
11:03:47 <aruro> like :m + Data.List
11:03:48 <hjulle> Yes, I know that I can import several standard modules. My problem is that ghci doesn't find those in my workdir.
11:04:03 <monochrom> Athas: naming some intermediate results helps, but not all. I am talking about people who do all, not just some.
11:04:04 <aruro> there is space in between, i appologize not :m+ but :m +
11:04:48 <monochrom> not to mention that it is a common XY problem.
11:04:55 <nocturne777> Athas: Should we usually use this Monad when we have a function that invokes couple of other functions which need the Env ?
11:05:32 <monochrom> problem X: "I need to output 1+2". problem Y: "I think in order to do that, I need to store 1+2 in a mutable variable first. hi #haskell, how do I do mutable variables?"
11:05:59 <aruro> hjulle btw did you define them as modules?
11:06:00 <aruro> :)
11:06:06 <hjulle> Yes :)
11:06:51 <hjulle> If I :load a module, I can ":module +" any module that it depends on.
11:07:43 <nocturne777> When do you guys usually use the Reader Monad?
11:07:48 <hjulle> But if I :l the child I can't ":m + " the parent. It gives "Could not find module..."
11:09:06 <nocturne777> is it mostly driven by the need  to pass the "env" to couple of functions ?
11:11:53 <Bashmetim> Say I have two different types that are actually "the same"
11:11:54 <Bashmetim> data Point = Point {pointX :: Double, pointY :: Double}
11:11:54 <Bashmetim> data Polar = Polar {radius :: Double, angle :: Double}
11:11:56 <hjulle> Oh, If I do not ":l" any file it (:m +) seems to work as expected. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22717279/ghci-cant-load-module-if-both-package-conf-and-source-path-contains-it?rq=1
11:12:37 <Bashmetim> Can I write a function that would take either a Point or a Polar and do the same thing to either?
11:13:34 <Stratege> afaik you can't without using "evil" things
11:13:43 <aruro> typeclasses
11:13:49 <Stratege> ^ or that.
11:13:52 <aruro> put them in the same typeclass
11:14:04 <Bashmetim> That does make a lot of sense!
11:14:08 <aruro> and define your function on that typeclass
11:14:24 <monochrom> what does "the same thing" mean?
11:14:30 <aruro> effectively it will be overloaded funciton :)
11:14:41 <monochrom> here is an example of my interpretation
11:14:46 * hackagebot uuid-types 1.0.1 - Type definitions for Universally Unique Identifiers  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uuid-types-1.0.1 (AntoineLatter)
11:14:48 * hackagebot uuid 1.3.10 - For creating, comparing, parsing and printing Universally Unique Identifiers  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uuid-1.3.10 (AntoineLatter)
11:15:01 <aruro> for example length will be same
11:15:08 <aruro> he has two different coordinate systems
11:15:14 <aruro> so length is conserved
11:15:37 <Bashmetim> I should have thought of that... the other thing I was imagining was data Coord = Point {...} | Polar {...} 
11:15:44 <monochrom> modulus :: Either Point Polar -> Double; modulus (Left (Point x y)) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2); modulus (Right (Polar r _)) = r
11:15:50 <aruro> yes or that!
11:15:59 <aruro> you made extra type
11:16:07 <aruro> sounds even easier than typeclass :)
11:16:10 <monochrom> then modulus "does" "the same" "thing" to "both" Point "and" Polar
11:16:27 <monochrom> (yes it's intentionally full of quotes because who knows what they "mean")
11:16:41 <Bashmetim> "man"
11:17:06 <aruro> :t Either
11:17:08 <lambdabot>     Not in scope: data constructor ‘Either’
11:17:08 <lambdabot>     Perhaps you meant one of these:
11:17:08 <lambdabot>       variable ‘either’ (imported from Data.Either),
11:17:09 <Bashmetim> By the same thing, I meant the constructors have the same type
11:17:19 <Bashmetim> :info Either
11:17:25 <monochrom> and if you have Polar then the rectangular version should be called Rectangular or Cartesian because it does not hold a monopoly on points
11:17:28 <aruro> he did same as your idea about Coord type
11:17:35 <aruro> just Either is already defined for you
11:17:44 <ByteEater> hi, all! does anybody know why GHCi replaces the type variable r with Integer when I ask for f's type? let f = (\g x y -> g x + g y) :: Num r => (forall a. a -> r) -> b -> c -> r
11:17:51 <aruro> use your idea about Coord it was good
11:17:57 <ProofTechnique> ByteEater: Defaulting rules
11:17:58 <aruro> and it was yours thats most important :)
11:18:09 <c_wraith> ByteEater: monomorphism restriction
11:18:20 <ByteEater> curiously though, it stays a type variable when I ask directly: :t (\g x y -> g x + g y) :: Num r => (forall a. a -> r) -> b -> c -> r
11:18:33 <c_wraith> ByteEater: monomorphism restriction
11:19:02 <c_wraith> ByteEater: things that are not defined as functions syntactically and don't have explicity type signatures get defaulted to monomorphic types
11:19:19 <c_wraith> ByteEater: recent versions of GHC have removed it
11:19:59 <c_wraith> Oh, and having a typeclass constraint is needed, I think.
11:20:17 <ByteEater> I had a feeling that this term would come up :-D
11:20:19 <ByteEater> thanks
11:21:03 <ByteEater> c_wraith: you mean that the monomorphism restriction has been completely removed in recent versions?
11:21:22 <nszceta> how employable are developers which use haskell primary or exclusively
11:21:56 <aruro> how employable you wanna get?
11:22:02 <Bashmetim> I have a good friend who just got a job where they want him to write haskell
11:22:07 <monochrom> no, not completely. more like unpredictably
11:22:08 <aruro> i know people doing ocaml for a job :D
11:22:45 <Bashmetim> He was a java man before that, but didn't like it as much... He would tell you not to do anything exclusively!
11:23:41 <aruro> just google haskell in industry
11:23:45 <monochrom> all the same, don't do everything inclusively either
11:24:52 <Bashmetim> If haskell's your go-to language, that's either really attractive or unattractive, depending on who you ask
11:27:12 <nszceta> thanks for the thoughts
11:27:52 <aruro> more importantly concepts from and related to haskell are found in other languages
11:28:00 <aruro> like F# etc
11:28:13 <aruro> so your work to understand it will not be lost
11:28:36 <Bashmetim> I find thinking functionally helps me write cleaner C++ and Java
11:29:42 <Bashmetim> You start mentally seperating the parts of your code that are pure from the parts that aren't, and prefer writing shorter functions that obviously work
11:37:59 <caconym> learning haskell did make me a better programmer in other languages
11:38:23 <caconym> although these days i tend to get pretty annoyed by other languages' designs compared to haskell
11:40:26 <int-index> I'm using Snap framework with Heist templating. To initialize Heist I use `heistInit' "templates" emptyHeistConfig`, and it should set the default namespace to `h`. However, I get an empty namespace. What am I doing wrong?
11:41:32 <mightybyte> int-index: What version of heist are you using?
11:42:20 <int-index> mightybyte: 0.14
11:42:49 <mightybyte> 0.14.0?
11:42:55 <int-index> 0.14.0.1
11:43:34 <mightybyte> int-index: I was just testing with 0.14.1 and it worked fine.
11:45:08 <int-index> mightybyte: I define a custom splice named "categories" and use it as <categories> ... </categories> in my template. If I use <h:categories> instead it fails.
11:47:17 <mightybyte> int-index: I just ran this example  https://gist.github.com/mikeplus64/5f0e4a4d196fd5469adc
11:47:40 <mightybyte> And it works fine when I add these two lines
11:47:43 <mightybyte> hcLoadTimeSplices .~ defaultLoadTimeSplices
11:47:50 <mightybyte> hcNamespace .~ ""
11:50:58 <int-index> mightybyte: I'm going to make a gist that shows my problem, then.
11:51:12 <mightybyte> Ok
11:51:34 <mightybyte> int-index: You also might want to come into #snapframework
11:52:02 <int-index> mightybyte: I wasn't aware of that channel, I'll post my gist there.

12:22:15 <lpaste> Exio4 pasted “'kind-indexed'? existential types” at http://lpaste.net/130213
12:22:51 <exio4> does anyone know a workaround around this 'limitation'? it's basically making the kind polymorphic for avoiding repeating code 
12:26:58 <sammecs> Why not forall z. Proxy z -> Exz z? I there a difference?
12:27:12 <sammecs> s/I/is
12:27:43 <slyfo> Hi can anyone help me with simple recursive lists?
12:28:40 <WardL> I am trying to get the current time using Data.Time.Clock.POSIX.getPOSIXTime
12:28:41 <sammecs> slyfo: Do you have a problem using them or a problem understanding them?
12:29:14 <WardL> The values this returns seems to be wrong however - when I call the function two times with approximately 5 seconds in between, only a mere 600ms have elapsed according to the result
12:29:21 <slyfo> Both 
12:29:49 <slyfo> I understand the concept but i cant use them so there must be something what i dont understand 
12:30:04 <exio4> sammecs: that'd basically say give me not some type of certain kind, but a type of certain type, wouldn't it?
12:30:17 <exio4> er, just the type*
12:31:45 <Clint> WardL: are you calling it by hand?
12:32:02 <WardL> yes
12:32:11 <WardL> let start = getPOSIXTime
12:32:24 <WardL> then 5 seconds later, let stop = getPOSIXTime
12:32:29 <exio4> that isn't calling "getPOSIXTime"
12:32:38 <WardL> Then what am I doing?
12:32:48 <exio4> that is just saying "start" is equals to the action "getPOSIXTime" 
12:32:52 <sinelaw> question: I have data Exp a = Lit a Int | Var a String | Plus a (Exp a) (Exp a) deriving Functor; I want to be able to map the top-level 'a' only without recursion
12:33:02 <exio4> you probably want start <- getPOSIXTime
12:33:07 <WardL> of course it is!
12:33:11 * WardL slaps head
12:33:12 <sinelaw> seems like deriving Functor recurses or at least goes into the child 'Exp' mentioned in each constructor?
12:33:20 <sinelaw> not sure.. :/
12:33:29 <monochrom> yes, derived Functor is recursive
12:33:32 <sinelaw> ok
12:33:41 <WardL> Still, my code isn't doing what I want
12:33:50 <sinelaw> monochrom, is there a non-boilerplate way of getting a map only on the top-level annotation?
12:34:01 <monochrom> I don't know.
12:34:16 <sammecs> slyfo: Have you tried the chapter from Learn you a haskell about lists?
12:34:49 * hackagebot wiring 0.2.1 - Wiring, promotion and demotion of types.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wiring-0.2.1 (seanparsons)
12:35:41 <WardL> I'm using winGHCI. I have a main-function (type IO () which do's some actions, such as reading input, calculating a function (let's call if f), and writing output. I call start <- getPOSIXTime() before calling f, then call f, then call stop <- getPOSIXTime(). Afterwards, I write my output file and do print $ (stop - start) .
12:35:45 <slyfo> Nah i havent looked at it yet as i studied from the notes from school but i take a look at it
12:36:08 <sinelaw> how can I derive a non-recursive Functor instance (or generate that kind of fmap without boilerplate)?
12:36:22 <sinelaw> obviously it would take (a -> a)
12:36:24 <WardL> This prints out "0.5890337s". winGHCI on the other hand also times execution time, and reports "0.11 secs", which is less than what I have calculated.
12:36:36 <sinelaw> so not actually Functor
12:36:47 <sinelaw> hey Peaker 
12:36:59 <athan> Is there something like an ordered-map, where if I query a key `k` such that forall `k' in map, k > (or < for a different implementation) k'` and k /= any k', it will succeed the query with the _closest_ key? Something like a defaulting map?
12:37:04 <WardL> As far as I understand, the time winGHCI reports should be greater than my time, not smaller
12:37:57 <sammecs> WardL: If you want to do benchmarking, use Criterion...
12:38:56 <WardL> As far as I see online, Criterion is not installed by default.
12:39:11 <WardL> This is for a school assignment. We are free to choose our programming language, and have to report on the runtime in an output file. The code has to run on the university computers, on which I don't have installation privileges
12:39:22 <Fuuzetsu> neither is the library that gives ‘getPOSIXTime’ I believe…
12:39:50 <WardL> it's included in winGHCI
12:39:54 <WardL> apparantly
12:40:11 <monochrom> athan: use lookupLT, lookupGT, lookupLE, lookupGE
12:40:13 <exio4> getPOSIXTime() isn't a thing, either
12:40:18 <Fuuzetsu> anyway you don't have to run benchmarks when your main program runs, you do benchmarks while you develop…
12:40:24 <athan> monochrom: !! Sorry, thank you!!
12:40:26 <Fuuzetsu> maybe if you said what your actual task is
12:40:47 <WardL> The task is quite irrelevant, it's about intersection of rectangles
12:41:14 <WardL> I have to print out the number of intersections between a given set of rectangles, and the time it took to compute that number
12:43:02 <WardL> Is there a possibility that winGHCI is not accurate?
12:43:26 <Fuuzetsu> always a possibility
12:43:57 <WardL> The annoying thing is, it's easter holiday right now, so testing which modules are installed on the university computers is quite impossible
12:43:59 <Fuuzetsu> maybe it's reporting cpu time while you're measuring wall clock time?
12:44:46 <WardL> that sounds like a plausible option
12:45:23 <kadoban> WardL: By the way, you know you don't need superuser privs or anything to install ghc/cabal/packages for yourself, right? Even at home I just install in my home directory and it works perfectly.
12:46:37 <WardL> yeah, but I'm not the one running them. The TA will run the code on his account
12:46:44 <butyoudonot> .ц 13
12:47:00 <WardL> And I don't have the privileges to install it university-wide for everyone
12:49:06 <WardL> Thanks for the help anyway
12:54:28 <sammecs> About the paradox from above: Maybe GHC ran with optimizations and thus the main program terminated before the actual calculation stopped?

12:55:16 <broma0> Will clojure help me pick up haskell faster?
12:55:41 <tdammers> if you want to learn Haskell, just learn Haskell
12:56:22 <tdammers> knowing clojure, or *any* programming language really, will help, but learning it just for the purpose of learning Haskell eventually is probably not worth it
12:56:36 <broma0> I already know clojure, and write it all day every day at work.. Im picking up haskell as a side project
12:57:30 <broma0> Thanks for the tip though
12:57:45 <kadoban> Then it'll probably help a decent amount. Although the languages are quite different, it's closer than the usual bunch of imperative langs.

13:06:36 <Bashmetim> How do you declare a type with a constraint on the constructor?
13:07:07 <Peaker> Bashmetim: you can do it with a GADT, if you want the constraint to make sense

13:07:40 <athan> :v
13:07:46 <athan> don't go to that
13:07:53 <athan> Bashmetim: It's a generalized abstract data type
13:08:05 <athan> Bashmetim: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT
13:08:50 <Peaker> Bashmetim: e.g: data Foo a where MkFoo :: Constraint f => Maybe (f Int) -> Foo f
13:10:54 <Bashmetim> That's totally what I'm after
13:10:55 <Bashmetim> !
13:13:02 <athan> That isn't what I would expect for the behaviour of foldr
13:13:08 <athan> back-to-front, so to speak
13:13:59 <monochrom> misconception
13:14:50 <monochrom> foldr (||) False (True : repeat False) shows that it cannot be back-to-front
13:15:21 <Bashmetim> Could I give a specific definition for a type's constructor?
13:15:32 <monochrom> scientific evidence often disproves intuition
13:15:55 <Todd_Whitehead> athan: you can use something like this: let f s = foldr (\char (acc, capture) -> if char == '.' then (char:acc, False) else if capture then (char:acc, True) else (acc, False)) ("", True) s
13:16:45 <Bashmetim> If I have data Stuff = Stuff {stNum :: Int, stStr :: String}
13:17:19 <Bashmetim> Can I define that Stuff n s = Stuff n $ show n ++ str
13:17:24 <Bashmetim> or something similar
13:19:04 <Bashmetim> I guess those need to be different functions, now that I spell it out like that...
13:21:39 <lpaste> nocturne777 pasted “State Change” at http://lpaste.net/130220
13:22:05 <nocturne777> I have a naive question. How do I keep track of changing state in an application? Let's say the number of soldiers change in a game. I am not able to find a way to maintain it across the application. I have the example code pasted at that link
13:22:21 <nocturne777> Am I supposed to be doing FRP ?
13:24:13 <athan> Thanks Todd_Whitehead :)
13:24:39 <c_wraith> nocturne777: top-level declarations create *constants*.  If you want something that can change, you should make it a value that's passed around.
13:24:54 <athan> monochrom: I'm actually looking for a map such that `lookup' 1 $ fromList [(2, "a"), (6, "b")]   =>   (2,"a")` :(
13:25:16 <c_wraith> nocturne777: this is very important for being able to reason about your code. It makes it explicit where it depends on values that can change.
13:25:37 <athan> With lookupGE etc., you still need to be within the bounds of the available keys
13:27:43 <nocturne777> c_wraith:  let's say I get REST requests twice to modify the number of soldiers, how do go about it?
13:28:26 <c_wraith> nocturne777: The first step is stop thinking about "modify"
13:28:37 <qwebirc60057> what is the best way to read this data recursively? "(a(bc(def)))" = Loop [One 'a', Loop [One 'b',One 'c', Loop [One 'd',One 'e', One 'f']]] 
13:28:41 <qwebirc60057> where data Token = One Char | Loop [Token] 
13:28:44 <d3dave> nocturne777: https://web.archive.org/web/20140809040959/http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more#state
13:28:57 <nocturne777> d3dave: I am aware of the state monad
13:29:08 <nocturne777> d3dave: in fact, the code I pasted uses the state monad
13:29:28 <c_wraith> nocturne777: you don't "modify" values.  You create new values based on the old ones, and use the new ones instead of the old ones.
13:29:58 <c_wraith> nocturne777: (with the occasional exception when using mutable structures, but that should always be the last resort)
13:30:40 <nocturne777> c_wraith: I can do that using a singleton [] I think, an array with one val
13:31:27 <c_wraith> nocturne777: the important part is writing functions that take the value that might not always be the same as an argument, and return a new one if they might want to use a different value in the future.
13:31:42 <c_wraith> nocturne777: ie, use arguments and return values.
13:32:35 <c_wraith> nocturne777: using State creates sugar for that process, but it will only confuse you if you don't understand how to do it in the first place.
13:33:13 <nocturne777> c_wraith: I understand the State Monad
13:33:24 <ReinH> nocturne777: From your code, it's not clear that you do.
13:33:31 <ReinH> You set the state to some fixed value, then update it
13:33:50 <c_wraith> nocturne777: I'd say your code suggests you are confused.
13:34:00 <d3dave> nocturne777: try decomposing the usage of State in your code
13:34:06 <c_wraith> nocturne777: State is *not* mutable values
13:34:39 <ReinH> Your code could just use put (num + change), it never uses the current state value
13:35:40 <ReinH> It would probably be easier to just pass the SoldierCount value around explicitly
13:35:52 <nocturne777> ReinH: I was thinking that "num" would be used as the current value/state
13:36:03 <ReinH> nocturne777: No, you pass num as an argument
13:37:09 <nocturne777> yes, I was thinking wrong probably..  I was thinking that the client code would know the current state, but that kind of makes things messy
13:40:59 <ReinH> since you always throw away the state, there's no need to use the State monad.
13:43:46 <monochrom> athan: lookupGE 1 (fromList (2, "a"), (6, "b")]) successfully gives Just (2, "a"). what's the problem?
13:44:26 <athan> o_o
13:44:34 <begriffs> How do you convert a HashMap Text a to HashMap ByteString a? Neither map nor mapWithKey can transform the type of keys.
13:44:38 <athan> monochrom: Not sure yet I guess, sorry
13:44:52 * hackagebot hs-inspector 0.3.0.0 - Haskell source code analyzer  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-inspector-0.3.0.0 (flbulgarelli)
13:49:54 <ReinH> begriffs: encodeUtf8 the bytestring and then look it up in the map?
13:50:32 <Fuuzetsu> that doesn't sound like the answer to what he wants
13:51:41 <begriffs> ReinH: I'm trying to either parse CSV or JSON depending on a web request that comes in. However aeson parses to HashMaps of one thing and cassava to another. I want to convert the parsed structure of one to match the other so that I can treat them the same later on.
13:51:48 <Fuuzetsu> begriffs: problem with such a function is that it means you can make non-unique keys all of a sudden
13:51:54 <int-index> begriffs: convert to a list of pairs to work with keys. You can't map a function over keys because it could break the internal structure of the HashMap
13:52:10 <nocturne777> c_wraith: are you saying that I should aways return State  ?
13:52:24 <int-index> so it's basically fromList.transformKeys.toList
13:53:38 <begriffs> int-index: ah cool thanks. Luckily in one case the HashMap is known to be small so I can do the conversion there to avoid a performance penalty.
13:54:28 <paulsh94> is the instance of Functor of ((->) a) just function composition?
13:56:15 <noteventime> paulsh94: yes
13:56:30 <paulsh94> noteventime: thanks :D
13:58:25 <athan> sorry, fmap (first encodeUtf8)
14:03:14 <qwebirc60057> is there a simple waay read this data recursively? 
14:03:22 <qwebirc60057> "(a(bc(def)))" = Loop [One 'a', Loop [One 'b',One 'c', Loop [One 'd',One 'e', One 'f']]]
14:03:44 <qwebirc60057> here is the adt    data Token = One Char | Loop [Token] 
14:04:00 <qwebirc60057> i appreciate any pointers
14:07:56 <Zemyla> Hmm, do you know if there could be a Lens-like operator over monads?
14:08:14 <Zemyla> For instance:
14:09:09 <Zemyla> :t \(f :: a -> ST s (f a)) r -> (readSTRef r) >>= f >>= T.traverse (\a -> writeSTRef r a >> return r)
14:09:10 <lambdabot> Traversable f => (a -> ST s (f a)) -> STRef s a -> ST s (f (STRef s a))
14:10:21 <nesqi> I have an infinite loop in my code that is triggered given some unknown input, the input comes from quickCheck but I can't see what it is because verboseCheck prints the in-data after the test has failed (which never happens). How do I get it to print before the test runs?
14:13:07 <Zemyla> nesqi: trace a = unsafePerformIO (print a) `seq` a
14:13:20 <Zemyla> Use this power responsibly.
14:13:44 <nesqi> Ok,.. inside the property?
14:14:05 <mpickering> I'm using hSetEncoding to set the encoding to utf8 before using hGetContents but I'm still running into "invalid byte sequence" errors
14:14:12 <mpickering> what am I missing?
14:14:25 <Zemyla> Use it wherever.
14:18:37 <athan> If I have a function `f :: IO ByteString` that gets chunks of data, and returns ByteString's `empty` when fully consumed, is there a function like `foreverUntil`, where I could run this IO action until it's unneccesary?
14:20:05 <nesqi> Zemyla: ok.. what do I need to import?
14:20:13 <mpickering> right, my file wasn't utf8
14:21:23 <c_wraith> mpickering: that seems like an important detail
14:22:23 <caconym> what's everybody's favorite JSON library?
14:22:54 <caconym> i've been using aeson and it's so far been a somewhat frustrating experience, but i don't know it that well either
14:22:58 <nesqi> Ah... import GHC.IO
14:23:20 <Zemyla> nesqi: Better System.Io.Unsafe.
14:23:23 <caconym> the 'json' package looks similar but with a little more flexibility, which is what i'm looking for
14:26:15 <okic> are there any other (existing) ways to upload to hackage? anyone know off hand? scp/curl scripts for example. 8|
14:26:25 <nesqi> Zemyla: thanks
14:27:02 <okic> oo nice an api.

14:27:33 <okic> https://hackage.haskell.org/api#upload
14:27:41 <nocturne777> c_wraith: I've modified it a bit. I understand I need to maintain the state in the lambda
14:28:26 <nocturne777> I need to keep chaining it  like this: ( modifySoldierCount 3 >> modifySoldierCount 41)
14:29:01 <nocturne777> to have persistent state
14:29:42 <nocturne777> c_wraith, ReinH: is my thinking correct ?
14:30:18 <c_wraith> nocturne777: well, that works, yes.  But it's just slightly-hidden passing around the count explicitly. :)
14:33:11 <ReinH> That's just a Rube Goldberg device for writing the id function
14:33:16 <ReinH> (specialized to Int)
14:34:25 <ttt_fff> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcjs-dom <-- is there a binding for window resize event ?

14:34:45 <ttt_fff> moving to #ghcjs
14:36:04 <nocturne777> ReinH: the question is where do I maintain ( modifySoldierCount 3 >> modifySoldierCount 41) ? The client code needs to maintain this I think
14:36:36 <elfeck> hey is there a way to use a "where" declaration over multiple pattern matches?
14:36:50 <ReinH> elfeck: You can use a case statement
14:38:08 <johnw> elfeck: just restate the function
14:38:13 <johnw> where foo A = ...; foo B = ...
14:38:13 <elfeck> ah okay thanks
14:38:33 <nocturne777> I still don't get how I would use this in practice
14:44:46 <nocturne777> I am really frustrated :(
14:46:18 <johnw> nocturne777: why is that?
14:47:05 <caconym> the 'json' package looks similar but with a little more flexibility, which is what i'm looking for
14:47:13 <caconym> oh woops sorry wrong window ignore that
14:47:16 <nocturne777> johnw: my plain is to maintain a simple state in a module, and I can't seem to do that
14:47:37 <johnw> you mean, you want "module global" state?
14:48:03 <nocturne777> johnw: yes
14:48:15 <johnw> it can be done with a global IORef which is not exported outside the module
14:48:20 <nocturne777> I want other modules to be able to query through exported functions
14:48:20 <johnw> I just wonder if it's really what you want to be doing
14:48:38 <okic> hey, how do i get my "module documentation" to work in hackage? can someone give me a clue what to search
14:48:39 <johnw> what if your export query functions were all within a common monad
14:48:45 <okic> it's all blank after i uploaded the package candidate
14:48:54 <johnw> okic: it takes a little while to genertae
14:48:57 <okic> oooo
14:49:02 <okic> cool thanks
14:49:34 <johnw> nocturne777: and that monad, say "Query" could be a Reader around an IORef or a TVar
14:49:34 <nocturne777> johnw: why do you think so? 
14:50:06 <nocturne777> hmm
14:50:18 <johnw> well, module global may be "too global", plus this detail wouldn't be reflected in any type, so it would be invisible behavior, which is almost always a bad thing down the road
14:50:47 <ion> And you’ll depend on IO
14:51:08 <johnw> whereas even just tucking an IORef into a Query type (a thing I've done before too), at the very least you are declaring a boundary for how global it will be, because you can have multiple executions of Query if you like, each with its own bounded and shared state
14:52:32 <nocturne777> hmm
14:53:59 <nocturne777> johnw: but my intention is not to export the state outside of the module
14:54:58 <nocturne777> I am thinking that a "Change" event should occur by calling one of the publicly exported functions of that module and the state change should occur
14:57:22 <nocturne777> johnw: hmm, a stricter version is STRef. 
15:05:00 <elfeck> is there a way to make this not so annoying?
15:05:00 <elfeck> http://lpaste.net/130223
15:05:40 <ion> data MyData = MyData Tag String; data Tag = A | B | C
15:06:26 <elfeck> aha okay
15:06:44 <elfeck> thanks
15:08:40 <johnw> nocturne777: if you had the constructors to your Query type, then in effect it isn't exported outside
15:08:46 <johnw> you're only exported the functionality and the behavior
15:09:09 <johnw> exporting*
15:09:30 <johnw> when thinking of "inside" and "outside", avoid thinking operationally, or in terms of how the functionality is implemented
15:09:48 <johnw> encapsulation can be expressed in many ways
15:09:53 <johnw> and closure is one of them

15:15:19 <nocturne777> johnw: I can actually maintain this state in a singleton Data.Map as well
15:19:24 <nocturne777> before I change the state, I can do a look-up on the current state and update it again with Map.insert
15:19:32 <nocturne777> does this sound very heavy-handed ?

15:31:27 <ReinH> johnw: I'm 99% sure they don't want an IORef and unsafePerformIO here
15:31:44 <kazagistar> so, flip traverse I guess?
15:32:19 <ReinH> And for that matter, if they do then they should stop wanting that and want something else instead.
15:32:26 <verement> hmm, thanks
15:54:08 <nocturne777> ReinH: if you could type an example or modify my example to show me how it could be done, I would be forever grateful. I just need an example.

16:12:42 <hunteriam> do modules not need unique filepaths?

16:13:17 <hunteriam> Because its definitely not, but the project supposedly compiles
16:13:17 <Fuuzetsu> it might be in X.Y elsewhere
16:13:26 <hunteriam> Could it be in another haskell file?

16:19:01 <d34df00d> Unfortunately, I could not make a minimal reproducing example, so probably you'll be able to help me anyway.

16:20:47 <d34df00d> Calling `matches` with the second argument being a string of ~10 KiB results in eating 10-20 MiB of memory.

16:24:19 <d34df00d> Ok, the problem is in `map`. Replacing `map f` with `map id` in findMatchPos results in huge memory hit.

17:32:38 <d34df00d> Ok, so replacing `matches (mkBwtData -> bwtd) = map (match bwtd (mkEncounters bwtd))` with `matches (mkBwtData -> bwtd) = map (map id . match bwtd (mkEncounters bwtd))` (for `match :: (Eq a, Hashable a) => BWTData a -> Encounters a -> [a] -> [BWTRow a]`) results in memory usage increase by 2.5 orders of magnitude (from 17 MiB to 5 GiB).
17:32:40 <d34df00d> WHy is it so?
17:35:56 <mpickering> What's the best way to read a file into memory to avoid leaking space everywhere
17:36:18 <mpickering> I would normally use Data.Text.IO but I eventually want a string 
17:36:25 <mpickering> is it best to still use it and unpack?
17:38:24 <monochrom> yes
17:39:05 <monochrom> although, it is unlikely you want all of the file as string
17:40:06 <monochrom> it is likely you want a little bit of the Text as string. a little bit at a time. so get the appropriate sub-Text first, and unpack only that.
17:44:29 <unknownloner> what'd be better to write than (x >>= (return . f))
17:44:48 <unknownloner> cause that seems wrong somehow
17:44:56 <monochrom> is it liftM and fmap?
17:45:21 <mpickering> I want all the file as a string as I'm passing it to GHC's parser 
17:45:41 <monochrom> egads
17:46:23 <monochrom> you can also use the "strict-io" package, which sticks to String but performs do-it-now input

17:54:23 <orzo> I need help with Numeric.AD.   I'm trying to use grad' but I don't understand the types
17:55:37 <orzo> I have reach :: [Double] -> Double  and  r' :: [Double] -> (Double,[Double])
17:56:00 <orzo> I'm trying to define r' = grad' reach
17:56:11 <orzo> Anybody understand my error?
17:56:35 <Fuuzetsu> what package
17:56:44 <orzo> package ad
17:57:07 <Fuuzetsu> which module
17:57:16 <orzo> Numeric.AD
17:57:21 <Fuuzetsu> oh, dumb question
17:57:22 <orzo> function grad'
17:57:59 <orzo> the example works but it must be leaving me with a bad impression of usage
17:58:42 <augur> anyone have a good tutorial on GHC.Generics?
17:58:55 <Fuuzetsu> what error do you get?
18:00:11 <pacak> augur: I think I used the original paper and looked at some code after that. Kind of worked.
18:00:21 <augur> hmm
18:00:44 <orzo> Fuuzetsu: http://lpaste.net/130226
18:01:18 <haskell360> hey everyone, I'm showing my 14 year old brother what an irc is!
18:01:25 <glguy> augur: I wrote a bunch of examples at one point which might be interesting if you're learning about Generics http://lpaste.net/107355
18:01:38 <augur> glguy: ok, ill give it a look :)
18:03:12 <jhance> don't you just need to lift reach into AD s?
18:03:26 <Fuuzetsu> that's what the error would make it seem like
18:03:36 <pacak> augur: Plus you can ask questions here.
18:03:37 <Fuuzetsu> but I can't tell that from grad' signature in Haddock
18:03:43 <Fuuzetsu> can you :i your grad'?
18:03:49 <Fuuzetsu> should tell you where it comes from and the type
18:03:56 <augur> pacak: questions arent quite the same as a good tutorial :)
18:04:17 <jhance> (Traversable f, Num a) => (forall s. Mode s => f (AD s a) -> AD s a) -> f a -> (a, f a), and here f ~ [] I think
18:04:52 <Fuuzetsu> jhance: but Numeric.AD.grad' :: (Traversable f, Num a) => (forall s. Reifies s Tape => f (Reverse s a) -> Reverse s a) -> f a -> (a, f a)
18:05:02 <orzo> how do i lift reach into AD s?
18:05:03 <pacak> augur: There's no royal road to GHC.Generics, you must suffer as everybody else did.
18:05:23 <orzo> grad' is directly imported from Numeric.AD
18:05:31 <jhance> Wait, what version of the package is being used?
18:05:47 <jhance> I was looking at old haddocks, but that seems to imply you are using an old version of the package that matches the old haddocks
18:05:48 * Fuuzetsu was half way through typing that out
18:05:52 <orzo> i'm using version 3.3.1.1 of the ad packge
18:06:02 <Fuuzetsu> that's rather old
18:06:12 <augur> if there is no royal road, pacak, then we should build one!
18:06:14 <orzo> well, it is convenient for debian jessie
18:06:18 <Fuuzetsu> like over 2 years old
18:06:35 <jhance> what is convenient for debian isn't generally convenient for haskell
18:06:38 <orzo> i can upgrade but i dont think its the issue, do you?
18:06:49 <Fuuzetsu> it's the issue of using outdated libs ;)
18:06:50 <jhance> orzo: Theres a type-signature change between 3.x and 4.x
18:07:05 <Fuuzetsu> it seems AD exposes the constructor in that version
18:07:13 <pacak> augur: Yea, right. Monads are fuzzy things, almost like burritos..
18:07:21 <orzo> well, okay, i'll upgrade if you guys promise to be here when i'm done and it still doesn't work
18:07:23 <Fuuzetsu> i.e. you could just map AD and it might work
18:08:42 <mpickering> What does the (...) mean in the profiling output?
18:08:46 <orzo> Fuuzetsu: just tried r' = runAD $ grad' (map AD reach) and got a lot of errors
18:08:50 <mpickering> ie myFunction.(...)
18:10:01 <Fuuzetsu> your runAD is in wrong place…
18:10:20 <Fuuzetsu> and is your map…
18:11:50 <Newb> Hey all, I have created a Clock that is an instance of Show, I am trying to create a funcntion that prints out the clock in 12 hours instead of 24 with an am/pm prefix, I keep gettting errors though and am not sure how to get started, can anyone help? Here is my code http://pastebin.com/TVcmJf8G
18:12:10 <Fuuzetsu> Newb: what error are you getting?
18:12:34 <Fuuzetsu> Newb: also, use lpaste.net , it will expose whitespace issues like the ones you seem to have
18:13:26 <Fuuzetsu> your show12Hour should be ‘show . hours’ instead to typecheck
18:14:37 <Newb> Ooooh that fixed it

18:15:31 <Fuuzetsu> Newb: No problem. I suggest you read the compiler errors carefully, they are useful. Also I'm guessing you're using hard tabs, that will give you trouble.
18:15:33 <augur> ahhhh i see, pacak, glguy: GHC.Generics automatically generates the combinator-based type versions of your ADTs, along with the conversions to and from
18:15:40 <augur> that makes things trivial then
18:15:59 <lebek> why might one prefer MaybeT (StateT s) over MaybeT (State s)? what does using a monad transformer for the inner monad buy me?
18:16:13 <pacak> augur: As long as you understand those things - yes.
18:16:35 <glguy> lebek: You use a transformer when you need to transform another monad: MaybeT (StateT s) is a kind error
18:16:50 <Newb> I have been using tabs but I am using notepad++ which I thought might be more friendly, I will definitely look into fixing my spacing then aswell
18:18:03 <glguy> tabstops need to be set to 8 if you want them to render correctly. Typically what people do is not use tabs in their source files
18:18:51 <augur> pacak: yes, those im very familiar with :p
18:19:45 <lebek> glguy: oh that makes sense. I was reading some code where I thought that was happening, but now I can see the monad I thought was bottom of the stack actually isn't
18:19:50 <Newb> Is there any way I can use show and then subtract 12 or do I need to use something like printf after I have already subtracted

18:21:29 <Fuuzetsu> hunteriam: do you have someone paying you to do research? then yes
18:21:39 <hunteriam> Fuuzetsu: im undergrad so i cant predic that

18:22:28 <lpaste> orzo pasted “need help with grad' usage” at http://lpaste.net/130227
18:22:29 <jhance> well you would live life as a researcher after you are no longer an undergrad
18:22:31 <Fuuzetsu> you need qualifications to do research so you probably want to finish your undergrad before thinking about that…
18:22:45 <hunteriam> Fuuzetsu: im wondering if i should pursue this life
18:23:00 <Fuuzetsu> orzo: looks to me that you're using the old version still, recheck your setup
18:23:02 <hunteriam> like should i really be investing myself into this stuff if its probably not going to happen? or could it happen?
18:23:02 <jhance> hunteriam: probably not a choice you want to derive from conversations with random people on irc

18:23:39 <hunteriam> whats wrong with asking??
18:23:49 <hunteriam> i was asking for your experience, not to make a descision for me
18:23:51 <orzo> Fuuzetsu: you are right, i didn't notice at first, i updated the paste with the new error

18:25:16 <orzo> i dont understand why the example lambda works but the type signature wants this Reverse stuff
18:25:21 <orzo> is it because Reverse is implementing Num?
18:26:02 <hunteriam> i actually thought there were plenty of employed researchers here
18:26:05 <hunteriam> i guess not
18:26:12 <Fuuzetsu> orzo: no, that's not why
18:26:43 <Fuuzetsu> does the example actually work?
18:26:44 <Fuuzetsu> did you try it?
18:26:49 <orzo> yes
18:27:07 <Fuuzetsu> alright let me grab the library and play with it…
18:27:10 <orzo> i tried it in the interpretter and it infered Integer
18:27:24 <orzo> i tried it in code and was able to make it work with Double so long as i stipulated gthe type signature

18:32:26 <Newb> ^ Any chance you could help me out again, I just can't get this to do what I want, I don't think I asked the right question earlier
18:32:31 <jhance> Newb: `hours` is a function...
18:32:44 <athan> How should I get requestBody data in a Wai application? I can't seem to write a higher-order monadic function to "extract" more data until the result == B.empty :\
18:33:01 <jhance> Newb: So you want something more like show . flip subtract 12 . hours
18:33:38 <Newb> jhance: Hm I dont know anything about flip I will go look it up
18:33:52 <jhance> Newb: alternatively show . (`subtract` 12) . hours
18:34:07 <Fuuzetsu> orzo: hm, can you make your reach work over Num?
18:34:10 <jhance> flip just flips the parameters to make it easier to pointfree
18:34:58 <Fuuzetsu> orzo: it seems to work with functions (Num a => [a] -> a) but if I specialise to Integer or Double, it does not
18:35:33 <orzo> well i need Floating at least
18:35:37 <orzo> sqrt function
18:35:55 <jhance> orzo: You can use floating, Reverse has that instance
18:36:21 <orzo> but i can't use Double?
18:36:47 <orzo> reach is a big function
18:36:52 <orzo> a lot of code to adapt
18:37:11 <jhance> jhance: I think the type that you eventually want it to specialize to is [Reverse s Double] -> Reverse s Double, but Floating a => [a] -> a should fit that
18:37:36 <EvanR> talking to yourself again?
18:37:41 <Fuuzetsu> ;P
18:39:19 <jhance> I believe the point of Reverse is that you have to do the computations inside of it so it can keep track of extra data and whatnot
18:40:20 <Newb> jhance: Thanks for the help and info, that subtracts hours from 12 but I am trying to subtract 12 from hours, I tried to simply reverse the paramaters but it kept giving me errors both ways you suggested
18:40:40 <orzo> reach is 73 lines of code, is there a simple way to turn [Double]->Double into Floating a => [a]->a without going through all that?
18:40:50 <jhance> orzo: Change the type?
18:41:17 <orzo> it's built from other things
18:41:24 <orzo> records used elsewhere
18:41:45 <orzo> i guess i just have to do this work, but it seems odd
18:41:55 <orzo> it's odd the library would demand generality that i do not need
18:42:06 <jhance> you can actually extract the Double from a Reverse s Double
18:42:24 <jhance> but given that I don't see the opposite function next to it, its most likely not possible to go from Double -> Reverse s Double
18:42:30 <jhance> so you have to do everything inside of Reverse
18:45:31 <orzo> is there way i can promote Double to an arbitrary Floating
18:46:09 <EvanR> realToFrac
18:46:14 <EvanR> convert rather than promote

18:52:37 <orzo> i just got a bizarre error message.  It says Couldn't match type `Integer' with `Double' but then  Expected type: Double, Actual type: Double
18:52:54 <orzo> expected matches actual?

18:55:48 <glguy> no
18:56:27 <Ryanar> Newb, we have syntactic sugar and `operation` is infix notation, normally it would be mod 24 12 but you can instead write 24 `mod` 12 with infix notation

18:58:45 <glguy> Newb: Don't worry about the "." operator
18:58:46 <Ryanar> hours is an integer
18:58:54 <Ryanar> you are returning a string
18:58:56 <glguy> just write: show (hours - 12)
18:58:58 <Ryanar> oh show
18:59:11 <Ryanar> yeah the . is confusing XD
19:00:12 <Newb> Scrolling over the annotated version you did now, but when I try just show (hours - 12) I still get error
19:00:24 <Newb> Thanks for the help btw, really appreciate it.
19:02:56 <Ryanar> Newb, yeah I am not sure why show (hours - 12) wouldnt work
19:03:15 <Newb> Well that annotated version blew my mind a little, I will definitely use it to improve my code but let me post up my error for show (hours - 12)

19:06:38 <yukko> is this a bug
19:06:44 <yukko> it seems like one
19:07:07 <Ryanar> Newb, try changing from Clock -> String to Clock -> [Char]
19:07:11 <yukko> (if you compile it instead of using the repl, it works as expected, ie, different seed each time)
19:07:42 <Ryanar> Newb, also, I am not sure how this works cuz I have seen people do it
19:07:55 <Ryanar> Newb, but you don't ever take in a Clock for your show12Hour
19:07:56 <glguy> yukko: You shouldn't generally call getStdGen yourself
19:08:14 <glguy> yukko: newStdGen is how to get a new StdGen if you need one
19:08:43 <monochrom> where did you read that getStdGen changes?
19:08:56 <Ryanar> Newb, maybe show12Hour Clock hours = show (hours-12)
19:08:57 <glguy> Newb: show12Hour (Clock hours _ _)= show (hours-12)
19:09:05 <Ryanar> glguy, or what he said
19:09:13 <Ryanar> do you have to pattern match the wild cards
19:09:13 <glguy> or
19:09:15 <Ryanar> for that to work?
19:09:27 <glguy> Newb: show12Hour clock = show (hours clock -12)

19:57:36 <c_wraith> johnw: The main thing I consider anti-functional about python is its benevolent dictator for life hating functional programming
19:58:07 <Lokathor> strong case
19:59:20 <c_wraith> He's made statements that adding lambdas, map, and filter were all mistakes made at a time when he was ignorant that they could enable functional programming
19:59:54 <johnw> well, that will just ensure it doesn't live any longer than it needs to, I guess
20:00:09 <zomg> hah =)
20:00:11 <Lokathor> i really don't get why a person would *actively discourage* functional programming
20:00:12 <zomg> there's your other side of the coin
20:00:22 <zomg> same thing as people complain about OO..
20:00:23 <Lokathor> i get why a person would not see the point
20:05:49 <EvanR> zomg: sounds like fairness bias
20:09:54 <TallerGhostWalt_> used --allow-newer for the first time, felt so good
20:14:07 <lvh> c_wraith: As another data point, I've been having mostly a good time with FP in python for the past six months, using persistent data structures and stuff.
20:14:16 <lvh> c_wraith: but the language doesn't make it easy or fun :)
20:14:36 <Fuuzetsu> lvh: or efficient
20:14:42 <EvanR> this guido interview c_wraith is probably referring to is pretty bad
20:14:50 <lvh> Fuuzetsu: In what sense
20:15:17 <c_wraith> EvanR: I lost the link a long time ago..  Where's the one you found?

20:15:44 <Lokathor> so if the only type signature in my program that uses Applicative or Monad is a single Applicative function, will I have to worry about the 7.10 changes?
20:16:08 <johnw> no
20:16:13 <Lokathor> i think... no? since Monad is changing, not Applicative, right?
20:16:15 <johnw> code that *uses* Applicative or Monad is unchanged
20:16:25 <johnw> people who write Monad instances will need to also write Applicative instances
20:16:34 <Lokathor> ah, okay
20:21:17 <c_wraith> also, it'll mean you can use fmap in code that only has a Monad constraint.  (Biggest win in the whole thing)
20:21:27 <carter> TallerGhostWalt_: its good stuff
20:21:29 <carter> TallerGhostWalt_: it a) means authors have no excuse NOT to provide bounds by default
20:21:35 <carter> but also makes it alot easier to do build surgery
20:22:01 <TallerGhostWalt_> carter yeah but pandoc broke anyway at the end :( 
20:22:07 <TallerGhostWalt_> 7.10
20:22:10 <carter> TallerGhostWalt_: hrm
20:22:21 <carter> TallerGhostWalt_: i'll do some sleuthing tomorrow at my work station
20:23:17 <johnw> c_wraith: aka, <$> everywhere!
20:39:41 <nocturne777> There's some video on youtube where Simon Peyton Jones says Haskell is useless. Does anyone know the story behind it? I think he's being cheeky.
20:40:19 <c_wraith> nocturne777: it's an excellent video.
20:40:23 <c_wraith> nocturne777: worth watching
20:41:03 <Lokathor> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSmkqocn0oQ (for those at home, so to speak)
20:41:06 <jellie> nocturne777: He doesn't mean it's useless like that. I think I've watched it.
20:41:57 <nocturne777> c_wraith: there's no language that could be considered in the nirvana category yet, though :)
20:42:08 <SetGuy> Hey all  I am trying to create an ADT for a mathmaticel set ( list of unique objects) using lists. Can anyone point me in the right direction or whip up a quick solution?
20:42:21 <c_wraith> nocturne777: turns out that building the perfect programming language is hard. :)
20:42:37 <jellie> nocturne777: He described it as being tongue in cheek. He said it because haskell will chose correctness over progress in terms of usage/library breakage.
20:42:40 <Axman6> SetGuy: what problems are you having? it's pretty trivial to do
20:43:02 <jellie> c_wraith: LOL true and not many people want to use it :(
20:43:11 <SetGuy> I am just not really familiar with haskell's lists, so I am not sure how to implement it
20:43:15 <Lokathor> SetGuy, https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.2/docs/html/libraries/containers-0.5.5.1/Data-Set.html like this?
20:43:23 <nocturne777> jellie: I agree. 
20:43:28 <Axman6> SetGuy: is this homework?
20:44:21 <SetGuy> AAh thanks lokathor I might be able to use that!
20:45:03 <SetGuy> More coursework then homework axman, our teacher suggested we try some of these excercises, they aren't graded but I am trying to get a better feel for the language
20:45:20 <nocturne777> I've decided to implement a SoS game using Haskell to put my learning to practice. After that it will a chess game. 
20:45:25 <Axman6> SetGuy: well, you won't learn anything by using Data.Set will you ;)
20:45:54 <SetGuy> haha very true axman6 :)
20:46:05 <Lokathor> ah, yes, if it's for learning you need to write it yourself
20:46:52 <Axman6> SetGuy: I would start out by using a list, keeping it sorted, and writing an insert function which keeps things sorted
20:47:04 <Axman6> which I'm pretty sure is what your lecturer wants you to do
20:48:03 <SetGuy> Yeah that is part of the followup, I just see the words Abstract Data Type and my brain always turns to puddy
20:48:52 <Axman6> lists are just abstract data types, so are sets, Bools, Maybe and so on, they're the bread and butter of using haskell so you'll have to learn what they are eventually
20:49:38 <Axman6> @src Bool
20:49:39 <lambdabot> data Bool = False | True deriving (Eq, Ord)

22:22:25 <Profpatsch> Is there a better alternative to output formatting than Text.Printf?
22:22:58 <Profpatsch> Something to easily define a representation of a struct?
22:24:23 <Stratege> calling show on it?
22:25:11 <platz> if you want to get fancy there's pretty and pretty-show, but haven't used them myself
22:25:32 <Stratege> if you got a record (which I think you are referring to as struct here? If not please do correct me), or really any ADT, you can just have it automatically create you a show instance via "deriving Show", or implement it manually.
22:26:12 <platz> the automatic show instance doesn't indent anything though
22:26:34 <platz> the groom package at least tries to do some default indentation
22:28:01 <platz> pretty or pretty-show give swiss-army-knife like options, but sometimes implementing your own custom function is sufficient.. depends on what you're trying to do
22:49:38 <Profpatsch> platz: Stratege thanks, I’m still confused about show.
22:50:14 <Profpatsch> I’ve heard different opinions, some stating that I should never use show for any formatting.

22:54:33 <platz> supposedly you should be able to "read" something that you "show", so it's supposed to give a canonical default complete representation, but not intended to really be used in programs
22:54:51 <wz1000> When Haskell was designed did it become referentially transparent because of laziness, or was laziness seen as a possibility after it was decided that the language was going to be referentially transparent, or were both originally design goals that happened to fit together so well?

22:58:22 <Profpatsch> wz1000: Lazyness was the original goal behind the creation of Haskell.
22:58:53 <Profpatsch> That’s why they didn’t give up on the IO model and had to try out different ideas until they found the monad thing.
22:59:03 <wz1000> Referential transparency was added to support laziness?
22:59:29 <Profpatsch> wz1000: Referential transparency as in everything is a constant?
22:59:51 <wz1000> Yes
22:59:59 <Profpatsch> Hm, good question.
23:00:04 <wz1000> And the lack of side effects
23:00:40 <Profpatsch> I guess that did follow from the goal of lazyness
23:00:56 <Profpatsch> Let me search for the Simon Peyton-Jones talk where he tells the story.
23:01:09 <Profpatsch> I hope I can still find it.
23:01:56 <wz1000> if y = f x is lazily evaluated, if f is not pure you do not know when the side effects will executed. However, if it is a pure function it can be evaluated at any time without changing the semantics of the program.

23:03:46 <lambdabot>  3
23:04:13 <pacak> arkeet: that's better, but not cryptic enough still.
23:04:26 <arkeet> I didn't know you wanted cryptic.
23:04:29 <Profpatsch> wz1000: SPJ has other interesting material on his homepage, too, under „Haskell Stuff“ http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/
23:04:32 <pacak> :)
23:04:58 <Profpatsch> arkeet: Did you just fold over function composition? oO
23:05:03 <arkeet> yes
23:05:10 <pacak> Profpatsch: Why not?
23:05:20 <Profpatsch> Good question actually. :)
23:05:24 <wz1000> Profpatsch: Thanks, that looks interesting.

23:06:36 <pacak> arkeet: Very good :)
23:07:35 <pacak> Profpatsch: mconcat with Endo monoid is also similar to folding over (.)
23:08:11 <haskell846> Hi, I'm a beginner and would like to ask a question on folds. is this the right place for a beginner?
23:08:47 <Profpatsch> haskell846: Aye
23:08:49 <pacak> haskell846: Sure. folds are our favorite topic!
23:08:58 <Profpatsch> pacak: What the heck is an Endo monoid. :)
23:09:04 <pacak> @src Endo
23:09:05 <lambdabot> Source not found.
23:09:06 <Profpatsch> Endofunctors
23:09:13 <Profpatsch> I spose
23:09:29 <pacak> Profpatsch: It's in Data.Monoid
23:09:56 <pacak> Profpatsch: The monoid of endomorphisms under composition.
23:10:30 <haskell846> ha ha ok .I was trying to write a function that calculates the minimum of the list .a very simple function indeed but I'm not making any progress and keep getting errors
23:10:42 <Profpatsch> Looks like I have to get up to speed with my category theory … :)
23:10:42 <haskell846> what i have so far is
23:11:12 <haskell846>  let minlist xs = foldr (min) [xs]!!0 [xs]
23:11:31 <pacak> > foldl1 min [1..10]
23:11:33 <lambdabot>  1
23:11:48 <pacak> > foldr1 min [1..10]
23:11:50 <lambdabot>  1
23:12:04 <arkeet> haskell846: you need parentheses around ([xs]!!0)
23:12:12 <pacak> > foldl maxBound [1..10 :: Int]
23:12:13 <lambdabot>      No instance for (Typeable t0)
23:12:13 <lambdabot>        (maybe you haven't applied enough arguments to a function?)
23:12:13 <lambdabot>        arising from a use of ‘show_M101598439894700044324577’
23:12:27 <pacak> > foldl min maxBound [1..10 :: Int]
23:12:28 <arkeet> (incidentally, you don't need parentheses around min)
23:12:28 <lambdabot>  1
23:12:35 <arkeet> also
23:12:41 <arkeet> [xs] is a list of lists.
23:12:47 <arkeet> (if xs is a list.)
23:12:48 <Profpatsch> > foldr1 min [2, 4, 1, 10, 4]
23:12:50 <lambdabot>  1
23:12:54 <pacak> Also we need Min/Max monoids :(
23:13:02 <arkeet> pacak: we have Min/Max semigroups!
23:13:08 <Profpatsch> wat
23:13:36 <pacak> arkeet: Can lambdabot understand those?
23:13:41 <arkeet> :t Min
23:13:42 <Profpatsch> There is always another abstraction level for a trivial thing. :)
23:13:43 <lambdabot>     Not in scope: data constructor ‘Min’
23:13:43 <lambdabot>     Perhaps you meant one of these:
23:13:43 <lambdabot>       variable ‘sin’ (imported from Prelude),
23:13:49 <arkeet> @let import Data.Semigroup
23:13:50 <lambdabot>  Defined.
23:13:52 <arkeet> :t Min
23:13:53 <lambdabot> a -> Min a
23:14:10 <arkeet> :t (<>) -- I think I broke it though
23:14:11 <lambdabot>     Ambiguous occurrence ‘<>’
23:14:11 <lambdabot>     It could refer to either ‘Data.Monoid.<>’,
23:14:11 <lambdabot>                              imported from ‘Data.Monoid’ at /home/lambda/.lambdabot/State/L.hs:97:1-18
23:14:20 <glguy> haskell846: The thing to understand is how foldr expands out
23:14:25 <glguy> > foldr f z [a,b,c]
23:14:26 <lambdabot>  f a (f b (f c z))
23:14:35 <haskell846> :glguy ok
23:14:37 <glguy> When you use it you pick an appropriate 'f' and 'z'
23:15:01 <glguy> So think about what you'd want f and z to be to find the minimum of a list
23:16:01 <haskell846> glguy: ok so I don't need to give it a staring vlue 
23:16:13 <glguy> The "starting value" is what 'z' is
23:16:20 <Profpatsch> But yeah, makes sense to put it into semigroups, since you don’t need mempty.
23:16:46 <Profpatsch> btw, why is mempty called mempty anyway and not identity?
23:16:55 <Profpatsch> or mid or something?
23:18:03 <haskell846> glguy: but why is my function let minlist xs = foldr (min) ([xs]!!0) [xs] not working ?
23:18:25 <Profpatsch> :t f
23:18:26 <lambdabot> FromExpr a => a
23:18:28 <glguy> haskell846: Because you make your list into a "list of lists" with [xs]
23:18:44 <arkeet> xs is a list.
23:18:44 <haskell846> arkeet: you said xs is a list of lists can you please explain a bit 
23:19:02 <arkeet> [xs] is a list that has a single element, namely xs.
23:19:03 <Profpatsch> huh, nice lambdabot feature.
23:19:08 <arkeet> if xs is a list, [xs] is a list containing a list.
23:19:08 <glguy> xs was already a list, [xs] is the singleton list where xs is the only element of that list
23:19:42 <pacak> Profpatsch: naming can be a bit strange in Haskell. Take "return" for example. It should be "pure" instead.
23:19:52 <arkeet> [ ] makes a list containing whatever is inside.
23:20:04 <arkeet> it's not just some punctuation saying "this is a list"
23:20:06 <Profpatsch> pacak: Yeah.
23:20:45 <Profpatsch> While we’re at it, Data.Magma is underappreciated. :D https://hackage.haskell.org/package/magma
23:20:52 <pacak> Profpatsch: Or all those strange names in lens - intentionaly choosen so not to clash with already used names.

23:21:54 <Profpatsch> pacak: Yeah, but that’s fortunately not an unsolvable problem.
23:22:27 <Profpatsch> Well, the naming probably is, but alternative Preludes go a long way
23:22:34 <Profpatsch> I like BasicPrelude a lot.
23:22:47 <pacak> Profpatsch: Well, php managed to solve it somehow. real_mysql_escape_string...
23:22:59 <Profpatsch> wahahaha, true that.
23:23:15 <Profpatsch> pls_do_that_thing()
23:23:16 <haskell846> glguy: Thanks so what i should be doing is try to write a function that pattern matches with a list like x:xs right ?
23:23:29 <haskell846> arkeet:thanks
23:23:49 <glguy> haskell846: No, foldr handles the pattern matching of your list
23:24:11 <pacak> haskell846: Don't forget about foldl1 and foldr1
23:24:31 <pacak> At least when you know that your lists are not empty
23:24:40 <haskell846> :pacak ok I'll look at those

23:29:27 <sw17ch> anyone know how to profile the `cabal` tool in order to determine what part of a build is taking so long?
23:30:02 <haskell846> pacak: foldr1 min [1..10] can it be written with regular foldl or foldr ? 
23:30:44 <pacak> haskell846: It's the same as case [1..10] of { (head:tail) ->  foldr min head tail }
23:30:50 <pacak> > case [1..10] of { (head:tail) ->  foldr min head tail }

23:31:07 <sw17ch> i’m trying to sort out why the time difference between running `cabal run` and `./dist/build/prog/prog` for an already-built project is so large
23:31:21 <jle`> hackage/haddocks now have instance sources ...? http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html#t:MVar
23:31:21 <sw17ch> `cabal run` takes around 2.5 seconds to dump usage
23:31:25 <jle`> when did this happen?
23:31:30 <sw17ch> and `./dist/build/prog/prog` takes about 0.002 seconds
23:32:13 <glguy> Running the program directly wouldn't have to figure out of anything needed to be rebuilt
23:32:35 <arkeet> jle`: neat!
23:32:41 <pacak> sw17ch: You can compile cabal with profiling as well.
23:33:06 <arkeet> too bad in my brower it gets split up into multiple lines.
23:33:22 <arkeet> "Source" goes on its own line, I mean.
23:34:47 <pacak> arkeet: If you get rid of lines 409-411 in ocean.css - it works fine.
23:35:51 <arkeet> fsvo works
23:36:19 <arkeet> now long instances wrap and it looks ugly.

23:46:40 <sw17ch> 8500 system calls

23:47:22 <sw17ch> and it uses the `read` for the dist/setup-config file
23:47:54 <sw17ch> and i can’t readily replace my cabal-install without breaking ghc-mod
