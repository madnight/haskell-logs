01:42:27 <dnlkrgr> with cabal, how can I make a local package visible to other projects so that I can use it in their `build-depends`?
02:16:10 <freeside> erf. ghc 8.8.3 has some kind of memory leak, it's taken up 10 gigs of ram compiling pandoc.
02:22:56 <maerwald> freeside: that's not a memory leak xD
02:26:44 <freeside> heh
02:28:21 <jophish> lol, just wrote a 800 character type signature
02:28:37 <freeside> Haskell: it's character-building.
02:28:42 <Tuplanolla> Does your essay type check?
02:29:25 <jophish> the typechecker loves it
02:29:30 <jophish> spends a long time there
02:30:47 <jophish> tbf this is autogenerated code, and the signature appears 3 times, i.e. (a -> a') -> a'' where a, a' and a'' are all variations on the same long type
02:35:06 <freeside> i might try 8.6 or 8.10. https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/17745
02:36:39 <maerwald> freeside: thats runtime and about rewrite rules afais
02:39:45 <maerwald> oh no, it's implicit dictionary argument passing causing thunk build ups
02:39:47 <maerwald> lol
02:43:09 <maerwald> freeside: so just pass -fdicts-strict
02:44:43 <freeside> okay, i will try that, thank you. just feeling a bit demoralized right now, i've been trying to get Word and Pandoc and AWS and ghc to all play nicely together for the last two days and i feel like i've been crawling uphill through mud
02:45:38 <freeside> i have found ghc-options inside pandoc.cabal and will keep my fingers crossed
02:46:25 <maerwald> this probably all has nothing to do with memory consumption during *compilation*
02:51:25 <freeside> you're right, that's not quite the right git issue
02:51:44 <freeside> i was looking at an issue yesterday that looked just like my situation, it had a nice graph of space usage, but i can't find it now
02:52:18 <freeside> anyway, my ghc is now holding steady at 1.2g

02:56:06 <Guest_45> Hello
02:56:18 <Guest_45> I tried to install Haskell on mac
02:56:24 <Guest_45> Through Terminal
02:56:33 <freeside> and it took up all your ram?
02:56:34 <Guest_45> But it gives me an error message
02:56:45 <Guest_45>   Reason: Incompatible library version: ghcup requires version 8.0.0 or later, but liblzma.5.dylib provides version 6.0.0
02:57:05 <Guest_45> can anybody explain how to fix this
02:57:36 <freeside> you might do better running your haskell within stack, which should take care of things like that. at the cost of other problems. https://www.haskellstack.org/
02:58:45 <Guest_45> But I need ghc and cabal

03:17:58 <maerwald> Guest15982: yeah
03:18:26 <maerwald> freeside: why you recommending stack :>
03:22:22 <maerwald> You'll probably see no less issues with cross-platform binaries on the stack issue tracker
03:22:36 <maerwald> Or cabal, or ghc bindists
03:25:50 <freeside> i am rapidly reaching the point of declaring that all software sucks
03:26:08 <freeside> i can do extraordinary things with code, but figuring out how to instruct Word regarding paragraph list styles is driving me to tears
03:26:08 <maerwald> Guest_45: which osx version?
04:51:12 <Guest_45> Hey guys. I installed Haskell stack, but I need ghc and cabal-install. I cannot do it through Haskell platform since it gives me error message: Incompatible library version: ghcup requires version 8.0.0 or later, but liblzma.5.dylib provides version 6.0.0
04:51:15 <Guest_45> Please help
04:51:34 <maerwald> Guest_45: please try again
04:52:03 <maerwald> just run the curl command again
04:52:14 <Guest_45> I already tried several times. I have Mac. And the curl command gives me this error message
04:52:53 <merijn> Guest_45: Which version of macOS?
04:53:09 <Guest_45> MacOS Sierra 10.12.6
04:53:09 <maerwald> Guest_45: I just fixed it, but the server needs some time to update 
04:53:47 <maerwald> hang on a second
04:53:56 <merijn> Guest_45: ok, so none of the Catalina issues. I just install the GHC bindist myself and install cabal-install by hand
04:54:34 <Guest_45> So just to make it clear. I used ghcup install, copied curl in Terminal. Then install fails and the reason is  Incompatible library version: ghcup requires version 8.0.0 or later, but liblzma.5.dylib provides version 6.0.0
04:54:49 <Guest_45> This curl: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
04:55:09 <maerwald> Guest_45: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/ghcup-hs/-/raw/darwin-lzma-fix/bootstrap-haskell | sh
04:55:21 <freeside> nice
04:55:23 <maerwald> the update takes a while
04:56:24 <Guest_45> Is this an updated curl? 
04:56:42 <maerwald> Did you run the command?
04:57:17 <Guest_45> Yes. I typed in Terminal a new curl. No success again. It says: Unknown SSL protocol error in connection to gitlab.haskell.org:-9836
04:58:27 <freeside> might be easier to just open the url in a browser and save it
04:58:35 <merijn> Guest_45: Alternative approach, you can download a GHC binary here: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_8_10_1.html#macosx_x86_64 unzip, then run "./configure --prefix=path/to/install/to && make install" :)
04:59:10 <maerwald> Guest_45: yes, you can just download the script and run it too
05:01:01 <maerwald> oh hang on, I forgot to upload :)
05:01:07 <maerwald> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
05:01:09 <maerwald> should work now
05:02:10 <freeside> i didn't have to pass any options to my curl but i'm on 10.13.6.

05:26:44 <merijn> maerwald: You can
05:27:23 <merijn> I did that at one point
05:27:25 <maerwald> I guess it would try to parse the subcommand first then and fall back to the other parser
05:27:38 <merijn> maerwald: Yeah
05:28:41 <maerwald> I basically want a subcommand to be "default" when it isn't specified, for backwards compatibility
05:29:03 <maerwald> Wonder how the help pages will look like then
05:29:55 <maerwald> merijn: also, did you see https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6771
05:30:24 <maerwald> Interestingly, pkgconfig database is part of the solver. Except no one knows how exactly
05:30:32 <merijn> maerwald: No, because unless it's work or directly blocking my thesis stuff I've banned myself from looking at code/issues :p
05:31:11 <maerwald> fighting the procrastination?
05:31:25 <merijn> Not very succesfully, but a b it :p
05:38:12 <srk> mm, both cabal and ghcid could use some improvements for cabal.project multilib projects. like error messages are starting with src/ and you can't take copy the path right away
05:38:41 <srk> for ghcid I guess that's just cabal repl and found https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5374 which points to ghc --interactive interface

08:21:43 <sm[m]> freeside, maerwald: pretty interesting that -fdicts-strict fixes ghc’s pandoc-building regression; good to know
08:26:04 <freeside> i can't yet aver that -fdicts-strict has fixed my pandoc build. i put that in as an option and then i think i ended up overwriting that change so it ended up taking 3.6-plus-swap to build. it eventually took a couple hours of mostly swapping.
08:26:29 <freeside> i'll run an experiment now.
08:36:03 <maerwald> sm[m]: does it?
08:40:02 <freeside> btw, where should one put the -fdicts-strict? in Makefile or in pandoc.cabal?

08:54:45 <zeta_0> i haven't found anyone that uses ihaskell in emacs yet, so it's hard finding someone to ask for help on setting things up in .emacs
08:57:09 <freeside> have you tried some of the others like ghcide?
08:59:10 <zeta_0> freeside: yes i'm currently using ghcide for my haskell projects, but i don't think it will work with ihaskell, that's why i'm trying to setup haskell-mode in my .emacs config

09:14:00 <Boarders_> For instance when I do case blah of (# a #) -> a what does that do practically speaking?
09:16:00 <yubrshen> I'm also a beginner. But I have not seen the 
09:16:13 <yubrshen> expression of #a# so far.
09:16:39 <yubrshen> Could you show a real code segment containing #a$?
09:16:52 <yubrshen> I meant #a#
09:25:31 <merijn> Boarders_: Have you checked the GHC user's guide yet? :p
09:25:59 <merijn> yubrshen: (# a #) is a GHC extension called unboxed tuples, it's not "real" Haskell
09:32:29 <Boarders_> merijn: I had a quick look but thanks for the pointer I’ll have a proper look
09:45:34 <zeta_0> if ghc-mod is deprecated, then what is the current auto-complete tool that's used with haskell-mode?

10:21:09 <dsal> Does anyone happen to know how Control.Monad.STM.TVAr.registerDelay works?  It doesn't say much in the docs and the source is a bit mystical.
10:23:39 <dmj`> dsal: lol
10:24:19 <dsal> I'm pretty sure this use of registerDelay is much better than my crude `timeout` based thing.  I at least don't *know* I'm spawning a thread.
10:29:02 <dsal> Searching for this, I just found out that my `liftSTM` already exists as `UnliftIO.atomically` and since I'm already using `UnliftIO`, might as well delete some code.
10:30:05 <dsal> UnliftIO is like a huge junk drawer of IO.
10:30:27 <Mathnerd314> is registerDelay really that mystical? https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/src/GHC.Event.Thread.html#registerDelay, it adds a timeout callback to the the main I/O event loop.
10:31:09 <dsal> Mathnerd314: In the STM package, it exports it, but I couldn't see where it came from other than a glasgow_haskell ifdef.  So I googled around a bit.

10:32:09 <dsal> Thanks for the pointer, though.  I assumed it did something like that.
10:32:23 <Mathnerd314> I'd recommend you use Hoogle, because Hoogle has all the base packages indexed, unlike Google which barely indexes hackage
10:33:14 <dsal> For some reason, I didn't think to do that.  My brain told me it knew where that function existed, but didn't make the connection that it was just a reexport from something else there.
10:34:26 <dsal> Also, just realized I basically wrote the code this thing uses as a module for my server.  I wonder if I can delete that whole thing...
10:38:10 <dsal> "this module should be considered ghc internal" is enough of a deterrent for me to not worry about it.  My thing works slightly differently anyway.

11:08:05 <baskaransri> I'm thinking about probability distributions, and I require IO or something to sample
11:10:01 <baskaransri> so I have a Dist m Colours -> m Colours which looks like extract, and duplicate is easy
11:16:42 <baskaransri> I could probably define it so that m was a class of things including Identity, but I'd want to run it under IO

13:38:27 <maerwald> I guess it's still not ready
13:50:19 <koz_> dsal: How is a type for _non-empty Text_, validating not parsing?
13:50:29 <koz_> You go from 'a text which might be empty' to 'something we know can't be'.
13:50:33 <koz_> You're structurally adding information.
13:51:11 <mpickering> maerwald: Please open issues rather than guessing incorrectly what is wrong
13:51:12 <koz_> C.f. [a] versus NonEmpty a.
13:51:57 <dsal> It's a bit of an X-Y, but knowing it's empty or not doesn't take you very far.
13:52:19 <koz_> dsal: In my case, it actually does.
13:52:42 <dsal> Yeah, it might.  I said "sounds a little like" not "you're definitely doing it wrong"  :)
13:52:53 <koz_> I'm fairly sure 'how far structural refinement takes you' is rather domain-specific.
13:52:56 <koz_> Ah, OK.
13:52:58 <koz_> My bad then.
13:53:02 <koz_> Didn't mean to question your judgment or anything.
13:53:10 <koz_> Just got a bit confused at the Alexis King reference there mainly.
13:53:26 <koz_> (I'm a big fan of her writing, that piece _especially_)
13:53:34 <dsal> Nah, I don't know enough about what you're doing, but it's a thing to think about.  I often overlook things like that, myself, so I figured I'd toss it out there.
13:53:53 <koz_> dsal: Oh, of course. I have been called on weirdo decisions here many times, rightly.
13:54:24 <dsal> One neat thing about writing this mqtt broker is that I'm looking back on my old mqtt code wondering why I did things this way...

13:54:39 <maerwald> e.g. https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide/issues/470
13:55:08 <maerwald> multi component seems WIP, judging from https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide/pull/522
13:55:33 <koz_> dsal: *mumbles something about documentation*
13:55:45 <maerwald> and there are multiple issues about users asking why they need a hie.yaml at all
13:55:49 <mpickering> "Everything should automatically inferred" is why all tools were broken for a long time
13:56:14 <mpickering> It's not as if people aren't trying to improve this situation
13:56:50 <dsal> koz_: Oh, that's one of the things...  A lot of the types are "not important" in the sense that they don't matter a lot for what I was doing at the time.  But what's this Word16?  I get to make things a bit better as I go.
13:57:04 <mpickering> If you expecting everything to just work suddenly after 20 years of things not working then you are going to be disappointed
13:57:15 <maerwald> :D
13:57:31 <maerwald> Also, I think I found a cabal bug in the process
13:57:38 <koz_> dsal: I basically got schooled on use of Word16 in domain-specific settings at work. Someone said 'just newtype the damn thing and give it a name'.
13:57:57 <dsal> Just regular type alias is fine for what I'm doing and is a huge improvement.
13:58:00 <koz_> For two reasons: first, clearer to the reader; second, you'll wanna add some semantics (or _remove_ some semantics) eventually anyway, and newtypes make this much easier to enforce.
13:58:01 <mpickering> The hie.yaml is intended to be mostly temporary to give the build tools time to catch up and provide the right information 
13:58:04 <dsal> It's not quite the same.
13:58:09 <maerwald> "constraints: your-package some-flag" in cabal.project.local will make cabal think the config has been updated all the time
13:58:09 <mpickering> but even then, how do you know if it's a stack or cabal project?
13:58:13 <dsal> But I can tell what it's for at least.
13:58:32 <mpickering> If you explicitly configure your project then everything works a lot better and continues to work
13:58:42 <maerwald> mpickering: yeah, that problem exists in codex as well. They hack around it by checking for .stack-work in fact, afair
13:59:03 <mpickering> There is no accurate check, you can have a .stack-work and want to build with cabal
13:59:14 <maerwald> true, but this is about defaults I'd say
13:59:16 <mpickering> hence why having the possibility to explicitly configure is necessary unless you want it to be very annoying
13:59:28 <maerwald> zero-configuration is nice
13:59:51 <mpickering> Sure it is, so use it on GHC where you won't have to configure anything :) 
14:00:00 <mpickering> because I already set up all the configuration for you..
14:00:16 <mpickering> master won't work for that actually but it will when my multi-component patch gets landed
14:00:33 <mpickering> If you want something polished then try again in 10 years ;) 
14:01:01 <maerwald> the multi-component is also a little confusing semantically... it could be multiple components from the *same* package and mulitple components from different *packages* right?
14:03:26 <mpickering> I don't think I tested multiple packages in a cabal.project
14:03:29 <mpickering> I will try that
14:03:38 <mpickering> It should work thinking about it
14:04:43 <mpickering> GHC doesn't really know the difference after all
14:06:25 <koz_> % :t ($>)

14:34:40 <maerwald> I'm trying to hide a single command in optparse-applicative, but it's hiding *all* commands then. Seems it chains different than thought
14:49:47 <johnw> maerwald: are you an expert on static Haskell binaries for macOS?
14:50:03 <maerwald> That's easy: give up.
14:50:06 <maerwald> :D
14:50:11 <johnw> how close can I expect to get?
14:50:16 <johnw> I'm down to 3 libraries left
14:50:36 <johnw> I wonder if I switch to integer-simple, can I get rid of the gmp dependency...

15:12:27 <jumper149> Is it possible to create a data type that is a sum type of all members of a specific class?
15:13:42 <koz_> jumper149: What happens if someone writes a new instance of this class?
15:14:44 <jumper149> koz_: There wouldn't be a constructor for that one I guess
15:15:02 <koz_> jumper149: Well, then it's _not_ a sum type of 'all members of a specific class'?
15:15:13 <koz_> I guess a better question is 'what's your goal here'?
15:17:16 <jumper149> I have a class and I want to be able to have a wrapping data type so I can give it toJSON and fromJSON instances.
15:17:41 <koz_> So you have a situation of the form 'instance (Foo a) => FromJSON a where ...'?
15:18:23 <koz_> Write a newtype Bar, then something like 'instance (Foo a) => FromJSON (Bar a) where ..'.
15:18:28 <koz_> Analogous for ToJSON.
15:18:34 <koz_> Then you can just use DerivingVia where needed.
15:22:02 <jumper149> koz_: No I don't think that is what I have. It's just that I need a sum type so that the client can pick one and then the server will respond accordingly. And it just so happens that this sum type will be a wrapper to all instances of a class.
15:23:02 <koz_> So you're sending the server some kind of message. Is it _really_ the case that the content of the message is 'a value of any type whatsoever'?
15:23:09 <koz_> (modulo being an instance of whatever class)
15:23:17 <koz_> That seems more than a tad unlikely.
15:23:57 <jumper149> I think it might come down to the way servant does the API.
15:24:18 <koz_> jumper149: Then I'll leave it to someone who understands servant.
15:24:25 <koz_> (since I don't)
15:24:37 <jumper149> Still ty for helping :)
15:25:02 <jumper149> I probably shouldnt focus on the class thing too hard and just create the sum type by hand^^
15:25:40 <jumper149> Then I can also make sure whether its actually isomorphic to everything in the class

17:33:59 <slack1256> Is there a standard way to find documentation (haddock's html) of installed packages?
17:34:53 <Axman6> If you're using stack, you can use stack haddock --open
17:35:05 <koz_> dmj`: I guess if we have an edge from u to v, it means u depends on v?
17:35:30 <slack1256> Nvm, ghc-pkg describe has the location of the htmls.
17:36:15 <slack1256> Axman6: Woah, I have a haddock command. I thought it only served to create the documentation, not to search it.
17:38:41 <slack1256> Axman6: I understood incorrectly, it is `stack haddock --open` which does the magic, not `haddock --open`.
17:39:14 <jackdk> I use `firefox $(cabal v2-haddock | tail -n 1)`

18:15:07 <koz_> Am I silly for wanting something like (Monad m) => (s -> m a) -> StateT s m a?
18:15:13 <koz_> Does such a thing exist?
18:15:29 <koz_> jumper149: What's the nature of your problem?
18:15:49 <jumper149> I want to have a data contructor like:
18:16:40 <jumper149> data A (n :: Nat) = A (VS.Vector (n * n) Int)
18:17:03 <jumper149> But GHC doesn't let me multiply my Nats
18:17:07 <koz_> You wanna import GHC.TypeNats.
18:17:28 <jumper149> I have TypeLits imported,isn't that enough?
18:17:29 <koz_> Something like 'import GHC.TypeNats (type (*), Nat)' should do.
18:17:39 <koz_> What version of GHC are you on?
18:18:13 <jumper149> koz_: 8.6.5
18:18:23 <koz_> jumper149: Try changing to GHC.TypeNats?
18:18:31 <koz_> If that still gives you issues, pastebin the exact error.
18:23:07 <jumper149> koz_: TypeNats doesn't make a difference. Explicitly telling to import (type (*), Nat) ended with: parse error on `import ...(*)...`.
18:23:34 <koz_> You have TypeOperators imported?
18:23:36 <jumper149> I can import and use (+) though

18:26:03 <koz_> Lol, thanks.
18:26:21 <koz_> It's a bit of a nuisance, because up until relatively recently, '*' indicated a kind.
18:26:29 <koz_> But in reality, kinds and types aren't distinct things.
18:26:34 <solonarv> koz_: lift . (=<< get) ?
18:26:41 <koz_> SO without that on, GHC thinks 'n * n' is actually a type.
18:26:48 <solonarv> or something like that
18:26:52 <koz_> Or rather, it's _not_ a type operator.
18:26:59 <koz_> solonarv: Yeah, I ended up writing this exact thing.
18:27:10 <koz_> I have no clue why it's not provided.

18:40:40 <koz_> c_wraith: Yep, GHC dunnos how to count.
18:40:44 <koz_> GHC is a four-year-old.
18:41:12 <c_wraith> pretty sure a lot of 4 year olds can manage that.  maybe 2?

18:46:37 <koz_> wavemode_: Emphasis on _bleeding_.
18:46:39 <jumper149> wavemode_: It's a project for fun and learning so I guess it's not too bad like this
18:46:53 <koz_> jumper149: Yeah, I'd say you won't get terribly far with ghcjs in combo with that.
18:46:59 <koz_> I'm not even sure if anyone's _tried_.
18:48:11 <jumper149> Yeah I also don't think that I'm gonna try that.

20:21:25 <MarcelineVQ> the gateway drug is unavoidably the most popular
20:21:48 <dsal> I wonder if it's like TAOCP.  Everyone has it on their bookshelf, because, obviously, but most people can't read it.
20:22:09 <dsal> remexre: What do you mean 'stock derive' ?
20:22:23 <dsal> Like DerivingVia?
20:22:33 <remexre> like I have a Term type, and want == on it to be modulo alpha-equivalence; but I want newtype LiteralEqTerm = LiteralEqTerm Term, where == on it is the instance that deriving (Eq) on Term would've made
20:23:11 <dsal> Or GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving?
20:23:42 <remexre> definitely not GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving; maybe DerivingVia, need to look it up
20:24:39 <remexre> I don't think DerivingVia does what I want
20:25:10 <remexre> I guess I want like, newtype LiteralEqTerm = LiteralEqTerm Term deriving stock Eq via Term
20:25:26 <dsal> I guess I don't know what 'stock Eq' means.
20:25:44 <remexre> ot
20:25:46 <remexre> it's from DerivingStrategies *
20:25:55 <dmwit> remexre: No, it has to go the other way.
20:26:13 <dmwit> remexre: Term has to have the stock-derived instance, and your newtype may have the custom alpha-equivalence hand-written instance.
20:26:15 <dsal> Ooh, I see.
20:26:38 <remexre> hm, unfortunate
20:26:41 <dmwit> remexre: N.B. I am not saying it is technically difficult or anything like that, just that there currently isn't a mechanism to do it the way you want to.
20:27:10 <dmwit> remexre: Of course, you can always write the instance yourself... or ask -ddump-deriv to write it for you and copy-and-paste...
20:27:46 <remexre> I might try building on Data.Eq.Deriving instead, and fall back to -ddump-deriv if that fails
20:33:38 <remexre> hm, types should be in the env for template haskell purposes as soon as they've been declared, right?
20:34:20 <heatsink> Template haskell splices can't access things that are defined in the same file

21:10:56 <zeta_0> huh, i've never seen that before, but anyways, so far i really like elm
21:12:29 <zeta_0> have anyone of you taken a look at this? https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/gghnuw/the_state_of_haskell_ides/
21:12:35 <remexre> yup
21:13:04 <zeta_0> i'm glad haskell's tooling is improving
21:30:14 <suzu_> same
21:30:18 <suzu_> haskell tooling is a big deal to me
21:39:13 <Axman6> Time to contribute to the haskell IDE stuff then!
21:39:57 <yubrshen> For
21:40:41 <yubrshen>  me, my defauld IDE will be always emacs, as I've invested already enough in emacs.
21:42:07 <yubrshen> The overall return on investment matters a lot, and also the effectiveness of workflow rather than individual features is more critical.
22:36:58 <suzu_> i recently left emacs for vscode
22:37:12 <suzu_> i just sorta got tired of working on my editor
22:37:36 <suzu_> and wanted to try out some new editors to believe that im still making a good choice with emacs
22:37:46 <suzu_> i tried vscode and sorta just kept using it
22:37:48 <suzu_> lol
22:48:08 <rotaerk> pfft, haskell tooling is perfect. PERFECT!
22:48:32 <rotaerk> well not really ... but good enough for me in practicce
22:57:15 <suppi> It would be really nice if ghcide or some other executable would ship with ghc so that tools can work with it without having the user install additional things and keep them in sync
22:57:42 <suppi> tools -> editors
22:59:00 <suppi> that was my biggest issue with intero, i had to install an executable for each project i was working on and keep them synced with the ghc version
22:59:50 <rotaerk> I just use an editor without any language-specific features except syntax coloring, and then I use ghcid; got fed up with trying to get intero/dante/etc to work consistently
22:59:51 <Axman6> the haskell-ide-engine solution to that is to compile one version og itself for each compiler you used, because it's not as simple as shipping ghc with itself
22:59:55 <rotaerk> haven't tried ghcide though
22:59:59 <Axman6> you need the version of ghc the project is using
23:01:43 <suppi> that's too much of a hassle for me
23:02:00 <suppi> I use dante because it just uses ghci
23:04:02 <rotaerk> I think I'll ttry out haskell-lsp when it's ready
23:04:43 <koz_> I'd be keen to try it, depending on whether it works with Vim.
23:04:51 <koz_> (and/or 'as such')
23:33:43 <freeside> today, i resume my pandoc compilation! on a new machine with 16 gigs of ram instead of 4. let's see what happens.
23:35:04 <freeside> [ 61 of 158] Compiling Text.Pandoc.Lua.Marshaling.CommonState
23:35:51 <freeside> and already it's blown past 4 gigs!
23:35:52 <freeside>   PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
23:35:53 <freeside> 13523 ec2-user  20   0 1025.3g   5.8g 145936 S 357.5 37.3   9:58.55 ghc
23:36:32 <freeside> it is impressive how much RAM is needed to compile a program whose job is, ultimately, to read one kind of text file and write another kind of text file
23:37:16 <freeside> i wonder if it's due to generics and aeson
23:39:01 <Axman6> Pandoc has a lot of data types IIRC
23:39:09 <Axman6> and, a lot of code in general
23:40:09 <freeside> the 1990s perl programmer in me is shaking head slightly

23:52:00 <freeside> aaaand pandoc built! yay! but pandoc-crossref is now not building! i think i need to hire someone to help do this kind of package management sysadmin :/
23:52:30 <freeside>  Could not find module ‘Text.Pandoc.Class’  There are files missing in the ‘pandoc-2.9.1.1’ package,
23:52:44 <[exa]> freeside: pandoc is huge by design, is something forcing you to use it?
23:53:53 <[exa]> anyway Text.Pandoc.Class should exist in any recent pandoc, certainly in >=2.9
23:54:20 <[exa]> oh, missing files, wow
23:54:30 <freeside> well, you know what george mallory said about everest.
23:54:51 <freeside> but also because i am thinking about extending pandoc with support for outline lists, by way of a filter.
23:55:20 <freeside> on a more teleological level, the answer to your question is that i am well on my way to reinventing pandoc, because i need to read markdown-like input and write to docx and html and pdf
23:56:28 <freeside> and i would rather not reinvent a wheel that already in size and scope resembles the roving city-states from "the biggest box-office bomb of 2018", /Mortal Engines/

23:58:56 <freeside> before i admit defeat and cabal install the filter, i want to try a build from source, because i might be writing just such a filter anyway
23:59:50 <MarcelineVQ> files missing usually means you're on arch linux and you've used pacman installed haskell packages
