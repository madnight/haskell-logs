02:23:16 <ixlun> Hi all, does anyone know why cabal isn't compiling for profiling when I use: `cabal v2-run -p --profiling-detail=all-functions hchess'?
02:23:55 <ixlun> all my code recompiled as well as the libraries that it depended on, but when I run with `+RTS -p' I get: `cabal: the flag -p requires the program to be built with -prof'
02:30:19 <ixlun> Never mind - I think I've fixed it with `v2-configure'

03:50:33 <Guest54698> Hello o/ I have very basic questions about Haskell arrays, but i kind find the answer on the internet... Is there any simple guide about basic usage of arrays in haskells ?
03:50:49 <Guest54698> (my questions are for exemple, how to get an array length, how to append an item into an array, etc...)
03:51:09 <Guest54698> can't find*
03:51:56 <Guest54698> (im talking about actual Arrays, indexed list, List are pretty easy to apprehend until now)
03:52:27 <Rembane> Guest54698: From which module do you import your arrays? 
03:53:34 <Guest54698> Data.Array for now, but i have no restrictions about it
03:54:02 <Guest54698> if there is a better/more modern implementation
03:55:50 <Rembane> Guest54698: Data.Vector has a much nicer API in my opinion. https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-0.12.1.2
03:57:05 <Guest54698> im expecting to use string as indexes, not int
03:57:20 <Guest54698> but i will check the vector API for another usage for sure, didnt know about it
04:12:37 <Guest54698> i would like to have a list of entities indexed by their string ids
04:21:43 <merby> hello
04:22:34 <Uniaika> heya
04:23:15 <merby> first time joining #haskell, seems great!
04:26:59 <__monty__> 't is, merby, 't is.
04:31:28 <nitrix> merby, The channel can get pretty busy during the day, but that shouldn't discourage you from asking questions :)
04:32:25 <merijn> Guest54698: Don't you just want a Map, then?
04:33:10 <merijn> Guest54698: Data.Map from containers would be the equivalent of python dictionaries/C++'s std::map and probably what you want with string indices :)
05:06:06 <Guest54698> merijn it seems that its exactly what i needed indeed :o thank you. For information. haskell array can be indexed with any kind of value right ? Im a bit confused about it now.
05:07:17 <merijn> Guest54698: The Array type from Data.Array supports indexing via any type that has an Ix class, so while you *can* theoretically index it using String, but it's not really designed for that
05:07:48 <merijn> Array is mostly designed for numeric indices (or tuples of numbers)
05:09:04 <merijn> Guest54698: Meanwhile Map is a more traditional "lookup key value pairs" kinda data structure (as I said, comparable to python dictionaries and C++'s std::map)
05:09:39 <merijn> Guest54698: Although some of the dynamic languages mix these things together and call map/dictionary data structures "arrays" too and allow indexing them by non-numbers, which confuses things even more :p
05:10:04 <merijn> :t (Data.Array.!)
05:10:06 <lambdabot> Ix i => Array i e -> i -> e
05:10:35 <merijn> So that's indexable by any type that has an Ix instance (mostly numbers and tuples of numbers, afaik)
05:10:48 <merijn> :t Data.Map.lookup
05:10:49 <lambdabot> Ord k => k -> M.Map k a -> Maybe a
05:11:18 <merijn> That works for any key that is orderable

08:31:32 <merijn> maerwald: But you can mostly already implement that behaviour?
08:31:49 <maerwald> yeah, it doesn't render properly though
08:32:13 <maerwald> e.g. in stack cli you have: --[no-]dump-logs
08:32:16 <maerwald> that's proper
08:32:23 <merijn> ah, right, but then what you want is probably just "better control over help text", which is somewhere deep down my todo list :p

11:14:56 <MarcelineVQ> That was kind of poetic until the urls
11:28:24 <koz_> The hell did I just read?
11:30:11 <ixlun> Say I had: `Data Foo = Foo Ordering' and then : `x foo = ...'. How could I convert `foo' into a template haskell `Pat'?
11:30:44 <ixlun> So far I've got `ConP ''Foo'
11:31:21 <ixlun> but I'm unsure how to convert the Ordering type consturctor into a Pat
11:33:09 * tomsmeding is going to assume that was a markov chain generator
11:33:37 <ixlun> I don't want to have to write: foo2Pat (Foo EQ) = [p|Foo EQ|] for all Ordering
11:35:25 <tomsmeding> ixlun: wild guess, would it not just be ConP ''Foo (ConP ''EQ) ?
11:35:38 <tomsmeding> or, well, ConP ''Foo [ConP ''EQ]
11:36:01 <ixlun> Ahhhhh
11:36:22 <ixlun> Didn't get that it would have another ConP as it's child
11:36:23 <tomsmeding> EQ is also just a data constructor :)
11:36:43 <ixlun> thanks tomsmeding :-)
11:36:47 <ixlun> TH is really cool!
11:37:48 <chkno> What's the simplest way to use TCP (client & server) while keeping the rest of my program Safe?  I'm starting from "error: [-Wunsafe, -Werror=unsafe] ... Network.Socket: Can't be safely imported!  The module itself isn't safe."  network-simple gives the same error, and pipes-network looks complicated.  Should I bite the bullet and learn Pipes or make small module that wraps Network.Socket & mark it 
11:37:54 <chkno> Trustworthy?
11:57:59 <merijn> Honestly, I don't think anyone's really using SafeHaskell these days
12:01:39 <Zetagon> Why not?
12:08:15 <chkno> I suppose I could keep most of my program in transport-agnostic Safe modules and then just mix the TCP in with the rest in an Unsafe top-level Main.  I'm using Safe because it came with -Weverything, and because https://wiki.haskell.org/Safe_Haskell says 'it's like -Wall', and I use -Wall (and -Wextra, -pedantic, clang-tidy, ...) when I write C.
12:30:50 <merijn> chkno: That's not the case
12:31:00 <merijn> chkno: You shouldn't use -Weverything
12:31:37 <merijn> -Wall enables everything you should care about, -Weverything includes *lots* of things that are very questionable (i.e. warns about things which aren't wrong)

12:33:35 <christo> what should i be .gitignore'ing? 
12:33:39 <merijn> chkno: Actually using Safe means you're going to have to audit your dependencies and mark which ones you're going to trust, or it's not really going to do anything for you :)
12:33:42 <christo> dist/ folder? 
12:34:02 <merijn> christo: dist and dist-newstyle, that should be the only thing cabal really makes
12:34:27 <christo> thx, what does those folders contain? the build of the project? after you compile it? 
12:34:34 <merijn> And if your cabal-install is making dist folders, you probably wanna upgrade to a newer version of cabal-install :p
12:34:58 <christo> everything i need for cabal is the .cabal file right? 
12:35:07 <merijn> christo: dist/dist-newstyle contains the build artifacts of your project, yes (dependencies get installed in ~/.cabal)
12:35:19 <merijn> christo: Yeah
12:35:50 <christo> ok, will do a git -rm -r -cached then i'll double check the command for it lol

12:45:09 <maerwald> mouse scroll doesn't seem to register in brick
12:45:23 <lxsameer> hey folks, f: a -> Mb and g: b -> Mc . the bind for these two would be Mb >>= \b -> Mc  . is it correct to say, in order to compose these two to gether weh have to have a function like  z: a -> f(a) >>= g ????
12:45:46 <lxsameer> is z correct as a composition of f and g ?
12:53:24 <maerwald> Weird, seems mouse wheel up results in KUp event, not in Button event
12:54:30 <geekosaur> that's up to the terminal emulator; most translate it before the app running in the terminal can see it
12:54:45 <geekosaur> mouse wheel scrolling is just a bit of a hack
12:58:08 <geekosaur> (it should be multiple KUp events normally; there's often a configuration knob for how many)

13:03:41 <geekosaur> hm, although given how hacky that aspect is, it might only be one. (it's not really that kind of UI event in a terminal)
13:19:47 <maerwald> I would have expected alacritty to emit an actual mouse event maybe
13:20:54 <geekosaur> one could argue the translation is happening at the wrong level, but I suspect nobody would want to fix it
13:25:08 <geekosaur> iirc it's somewhat painful to do what you want, given that passing mouse events through is itself a hack; they'd have to arrange somehow for the original event to be saved just for mouse mode
13:25:32 <maerwald> well, it's kinda confusing, we have mousewheel in two events: VtyEvent https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty-5.31/docs/Graphics-Vty-Input-Events.html#t:Event and BrickEvent https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.57/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:BrickEvent but both never trigger lol
13:25:40 <geekosaur> (scrolling is not normally a UI event as such)
13:26:13 <geekosaur> right, because it's up to the terminal to pass it on and most probably won't
13:28:27 <geekosaur> at least, not as button or scroll events
13:29:40 <geekosaur> again, you could try reporting it as a bug in alacritty that it gives you an up key instead of a mouse event in that case, but I suspect they'll find it too hard to fix and that's why they send key-up to begin with
13:29:59 <maerwald> https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2512

14:48:47 <c_wraith> where did that question come from? Seems like an odd thing to ask.
14:49:59 <monsterchrom> This sounds like a continuation of a misguided line of thought from several days ago.
14:50:47 <frdg> I came up with it while learning about monotonicity of entailment
14:51:40 <c_wraith> It's also clearly not true with arbitrary functions
14:52:05 <frdg> oh
14:52:39 <monsterchrom> It is true and boring. It is merely part of the definition of "function" in the first place.

15:50:07 <c_wraith> nope.  The first one has the image [0, 1].  the second has the image [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
15:50:31 <c_wraith> err.  those are finite sets, not some sort of range notation
15:52:08 <frdg> I see it now
15:52:54 <frdg> there goes my theory
15:55:01 <monsterchrom> oops
15:55:04 <c_wraith> monsterchrom was referring to a simpler statement, which *is* trivially true.  Composing two functions together results in an image with a size at most the max of the sizes of the two individual functions.
15:55:24 <c_wraith> But when you are allowed to insert intermediate steps, things are no longer that simple

20:58:30 <emmanuel_erc> Is there some truth to the claim that the Haskell compiler is slow? (This was a statement a coworker said to me)
20:59:33 <monsterchrom> Depends on how much you're prepared to bend "some" "truth".
21:00:17 <monsterchrom> Type inference is worst-case expoential time, there will be a few carefully designed terms and types that force that.
21:00:44 <monsterchrom> The fact remains that this worst-case doesn't happen to useful programs.
21:01:19 <c_wraith> There are definitely things you can do to make your program slow
21:01:37 <c_wraith> GHC isn't great with huge string literals or types with thousands of constructors
21:03:23 <monsterchrom> I actually know an actual worst-case example from Okasaki. And yet, I don't just go around citing it as though it's the only thing you should care. In fact, I avoid citing it because clearly it is such a bizarre example you shouldn't care.
21:03:56 <monsterchrom> I bet your coworker is the opposite. Never saw any actual example, and still go around spreading hearsay like it's the only important thing.
21:04:02 <c_wraith> GHC definitely stresses linx's default linker, too
21:04:20 <c_wraith> *linux
21:04:26 <monsterchrom> You should put such people on your ignore list.
21:08:27 <monsterchrom> For life is too short to investigate every hearsay where the speaker doesn't bother to cite evidence or give examples.
21:09:03 <gattytto> hello, I'm trying to build the haskell-servant minimum example using ghc-8.10.1 and I have added all the recommended extra-deps to stack.yaml. But while building aeson it says "out of memory". I have  tried adding --ghc-options=" -j1 +RST -MXXXXM" with no avail
21:09:17 <gattytto> is there anything else I can do to avoid memory exhaustion? both in cabal build and stack build
21:10:06 <monsterchrom> I'm afraid --ghc-options="-j1" is barking up the wrong tree.
21:10:33 <monsterchrom> It would be stack itself and cabal itself that decides to spawn 4 instance of GHC at the same time.
21:10:52 <monsterchrom> as opposed to one instance of GHC deciding to spawn 4 jobs
21:11:14 <monsterchrom> Your -j1 should be given to stack or cabal
21:11:15 <gattytto> ah yes cabal has -j arg 
21:11:23 <gattytto> thanks I'll try that
21:36:50 <MarcelineVQ> aeson is pretty heavy by itself still so fingers crossed
22:56:31 <emb> Does anyone have any tips on finding remote part time Haskell dev gig?
