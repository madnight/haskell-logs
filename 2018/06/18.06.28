00:06:49 <dminuoso> :t flip maybe pure . throwIO
00:06:51 <lambdabot> Exception e => e -> Maybe a -> IO a
00:06:57 <dminuoso> drets: This perhaps?
00:07:29 <dminuoso> drets: It's visually a bit annoying that you have to jump around to follow the code flow.
00:07:36 <cocreature> throwError and throwIO are not the same thing
00:07:41 <dminuoso> Oh wait
00:07:43 <dminuoso> yeah
00:07:46 <dminuoso> :t flip maybe pure . throwError
00:07:47 <lambdabot> MonadError e f => e -> Maybe a -> f a
00:07:59 <dminuoso> courtesy of cocreature =)
00:08:21 <dminuoso> Or no, it was jle` actually :)
00:09:27 <drets> Nice, but how to call it?
00:09:51 <cocreature> some packages call it "note"
00:10:15 <drets> what the rationale?
00:10:50 <drets> Anyway, going to try it right now, thanks!
00:11:07 <cocreature> you add a “note” to the Nothing case
00:13:07 <drets> That will be a comment for this function.
00:19:31 <halogenandtoast> Out of curiosity why does serve use the Proxy type here: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-server-0.14/docs/Servant-Server.html#serve
00:22:01 <drets> Now, I am thinking how to make “note”, but for Either...
00:23:14 <drets> Quick `flip either pure . throwError` doesn't compile
00:23:16 <dminuoso> halogenandtoast: Server is not injective.
00:23:27 <dminuoso> (Its not a type constructor)
00:24:08 <dminuoso> It's a type family in the end
00:25:26 <dminuoso> halogenandtoast: https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families#Injectivity.2C_type_inference.2C_and_ambiguity
00:26:13 <dminuoso> halogenandtoast: So you have that annoying property that even if you had `Server T1 ~ Server T2`, it does not imply that `T1 ~ T2`
00:28:28 <drets> OK, either is a bit different than maybe =)
00:29:34 <dminuoso> :t maybe
00:29:36 <lambdabot> b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
00:29:42 <dminuoso> :t either
00:29:43 <lambdabot> (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c
00:29:59 <drets> :bow:
00:30:35 <dminuoso> drets: imagine maybe had the type signature: (() -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Maybe b -> c
00:30:50 <dminuoso> drets: and then imagine that `Maybe ~ Either ()` and you should see that they are the same thing. :)
00:31:40 <drets> yep.
00:31:57 <Taneb> is newtype Foo k i o = Foo {runFoo :: k i -> k o}; instance Category (Foo k); instance ? k => Arrow (Foo k) defined anywhere?
00:33:23 <Taneb> (I think it needs an Applicative constraint for the Arrow?)
00:34:00 <drets> Can I do it in one life: https://lpaste.net/1273163383255859200 ? =)
00:34:08 <drets> line*
00:36:21 <Boomerang> :t \e -> either (const $ throwError e) pure
00:36:23 <lambdabot> MonadError e m => e -> Either b a -> m a
00:37:07 <dminuoso> @pl \e -> either (const $ throwError e) pure
00:37:07 <lambdabot> flip either pure . const . throwError
00:37:13 <dminuoso> That's not bad either.
00:37:19 <dminuoso> Pun intended.
00:37:32 <drets> \0/
00:39:37 <dminuoso> Though Id probably prefer Boomerang's variant :)
00:39:44 <dminuoso> Pointfree is something pointless.
00:39:59 <Boomerang> :)
00:41:00 <halogenandtoast> dminuoso: thanks!
01:03:06 <mreh> whenever I build a project with a dependency on something edward kmett has written I see so many exotic new names
01:03:18 <mreh> should I be worried that I don't know any of them
01:03:49 <mreh> I never tried hard to get lenses
01:04:15 <JuanDaugherty> no
01:04:55 <JuanDaugherty> he's one of the most respected hs developers
01:05:09 <JuanDaugherty> and speakers
01:05:59 <mreh> he seems to be a leading category theoretician too
01:09:28 <dminuoso> Downloaded lts-3.20 build plan
01:09:33 <dminuoso> Okay that package looks a bit old...
01:18:11 <mniip> speaking of, where's edwardk
01:20:08 <JuanDaugherty> he's not marked away but not everybody does that
01:21:02 <JuanDaugherty> and it is 4:20 AM in eastern US
01:21:21 <JuanDaugherty> earlier elsewhere
01:22:24 <mniip> I think he was attending some conference?
01:23:48 <ventonegro> He tweeted recently he was back home
01:28:06 <jle`> Taneb: you might need Monad, if it is even possible at all
01:32:36 <mniip> so if I have a  instance C T => D T
01:32:53 <mniip> if I'm understanding correctly that introduces an axiom (schema) for  C T => D T
01:33:26 <mniip> that is elaborated into an actual function  Dict (C T) -> Dict (D T)
01:34:22 <mniip> Dict (D T) uses the value of Dict (C T) but there's no function/axiom that goes the other way, right?
01:35:14 <mniip> so  instance C T => D T  introduces C T => D T,  and class E a => F a  introduces forall a. F a => E a
01:36:49 <jle`> > let ordToEq :: Dict (Ord a) -> Dict (Eq a); ordToEq Dict = Dict
01:36:51 <lambdabot>  <no location info>: error:
01:36:51 <lambdabot>      not an expression: ‘let ordToEq :: Dict (Ord a) -> Dict (Eq a); ordToEq ...
01:36:58 <jle`> @let ordToEq :: Dict (Ord a) -> Dict (Eq a); ordToEq Dict = Dict
01:36:59 <lambdabot>  Defined.
01:37:22 <jle`> i think the abstract dict for Ord X actually contains the dict for Eq X as one of its fields
01:38:15 <adetokunbo> hello
01:38:20 <jle`> hello
01:38:53 <adetokunbo> I'm trying to remember the name of a tool that helps detect unused imports.
01:39:01 <mniip> jle`, yes, it does
01:39:05 <mniip> it's the first field iirc
01:39:17 <mniip> but the axiom schema is there nevertheless
01:39:24 <cocreature> adetokunbo: GHC with -Wall
01:40:20 <mniip> so consider for example  data F x = F (F [x])
01:40:25 <adetokunbo> cocreature: thanks - I should have been more specific - I was hoping it might help remove them as well
01:40:35 <mniip> if we have  instance S x => S [x]
01:40:53 <mniip> then we say an instance  (forall x. S x => S [x]) => S (F x)  is "well-defined"
01:41:37 <adetokunbo> I think it might be hindent ?
01:41:49 <cocreature> I don’t think hindent removes imports
01:42:05 <adetokunbo> ok.  Is there such a tool?
01:42:19 <mniip> as we can corecursively apply the (forall x. S x => S [x]) axiom schema to obtain a dictionary for S (F x)
01:42:30 <cocreature> I don’t think I’ve seen one but I’ve also never looked for one
01:42:52 <gonz_> adetokunbo: `weeder` should warn you, I guess?
01:43:08 <gonz_> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/weeder
01:43:12 <cocreature> you don’t need weeder for that. GHC can do that
01:43:15 <adetokunbo> gonz_ : I'll take a look, thanks
01:43:27 <Taneb> jle`: well, I really just want the Category instance
01:44:02 <jle`> Taneb: what if i told you that it is already an instance of Category
01:44:07 <jle`> without the newtype wrapper :)
01:44:13 <mniip> hmmm
01:44:22 <mniip> I think the ultimate problem is
01:44:32 <mniip> that NoUndecidableInstances rules aren't checked thoroughly enough
01:44:38 <Taneb> jle`: sadly, it's the wrong shape for precisely what I want to do
01:44:48 <jle`> ah, you want the rearrangement of type parameters
01:44:52 <Taneb> Yeah
01:44:56 <gonz_> Yeah, I suppose the cross-module stuff is a bit more interesting from `weeder`
01:45:16 <mniip> S x => S [x]  is well-defined because 'S x' is smaller than 'S [x]' and no variable occurs more often in the context than in the instance head
01:46:38 <mniip> aha, so I can't define an instance whose context includes an implication that violates the decidability rules
01:46:54 <mniip> but for some reason with RankN I can introduce such a local axiom schema nevertheless
01:48:33 <mreh> when cabal builds your package database, is it statically linking any C code (if there are any dependencies)?
01:49:30 <Taneb> jle`: sadly, Generalized Newtype Deriving doesn't work for it
01:49:37 <jle`> :'(
01:49:52 <jle`> yeah i'm not sure if i recognize that type from any standard libraries
01:50:09 <Taneb> I had a look in base and semigroupoids and couldn't see it there
01:50:27 <Taneb> I guess it's not something people often need :)
01:50:49 <jle`> there miiight be something in profunctors
01:50:51 <Taneb> I'm in fact using it polykindedly
01:52:25 <mniip> funny
01:52:59 <jle`> Taneb: it might be Foo f a b = Codensity (Star f) a b
01:54:06 <mniip> so the theory in the paper makes no mention of higher rank types (their types look like HM schemas)
01:54:21 <Taneb> jle`: that's got a too restrictive kind
01:54:47 <Taneb> (my k is something like Nat -> * rather than * -> *)
01:56:30 <gentauro> is it possible to define typeclasses in a C-style? I mean, I would like to place `class (Monad m) => ... m where` in one file and then `instance ... IO where` in another file (for readability purpouses)
01:56:46 <gentauro> and the C-style is with .h/.c files
01:57:51 <gentauro> what I have discovered so far, is that "my .c" implements the instance, but doesn't expose anything so I'm guessing that it's not beeing part of the build
01:57:54 <gentauro> :(
01:58:46 <gentauro> (module Foo where doesn't expose types or functions and therefore, I can't use it)
02:01:10 <gentauro> oh, nevermind. I might as well read the GHC error messages :D -> To import instances alone, use: import Foo()
02:05:11 <ZeuPiark> hello
02:06:41 <dminuoso> Im using FFI to interact with a library. That library expects a callback, where ideally I'd provide a Haskell function - is this a safe thing?
02:07:01 <dminuoso> Can I have the external library call haskell code?
02:08:43 <dminuoso> Or rather.. are there special considerations/things I need to watch out for?
02:29:09 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: yeah, you can do that
02:29:14 <mniip> gentauro, orphan instances impose a compilation performance penalty
02:29:56 <dminuoso> dexterfoo: How does that work with the RTS though? Does FFI provide some entrance into the RTS?
02:31:01 <mniip> dminuoso, you can generate wrappers or you can export haskell functions
02:31:03 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: yeah, you need to create a special "wrapper" function
02:31:32 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: there is a page on the haskell wiki that explains it all very clearly
02:31:52 <mniip> wrappers aren't strictly necessary mind
02:31:56 <Tordek> hi
02:32:07 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: i think the only gotchas are don't throw a haskell exception from your callback, and don't forget to free your function ptr when you are done (freeHaskellFunPtr)
02:32:33 <Tordek> I'm trying to build Taffybar from source, but I get it to this point nad I get a "perhaps you need to add 'time' to the build-depends" https://dpaste.de/8NSg
02:32:44 <Tordek> but time is already in the build-depends section
02:32:57 <mniip> for example here I'm exporting a haskell function and then reimporting it as a pointer: https://github.com/mniip/hexchat-haskell/blob/master/HexChat/Internal.hs#L129-L131
02:33:09 <mniip> then I can pass it as a callback: https://github.com/mniip/hexchat-haskell/blob/master/HexChat/Internal.hs#L342
02:33:52 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: https://wiki.haskell.org/Foreign_Function_Interface#Function_pointers
02:34:33 <dexterfoo> mniip: interesting looking project!
02:35:28 <c50a326> hey guys this is my screen right now https://i.imgur.com/IqANujw.png and I also have a deck of playing cards that I tried using to physically map out the insert function on playing cards (using the card number as the timestamp) ... this is for cis194 homework #2 on ADT's...
02:35:39 <c50a326> can you guys suggest some better ways to test this function and the output?
02:35:52 <c50a326> the output is really unreadable, someone suggested a pretty-show function yesterday, is this the best way?
02:36:24 <dminuoso> c50a326: `show/Show` are not meant for human readable output. They are meant to produce valid Haskell code that will generate the same data.
02:36:28 <c50a326> I just want to be able to test and feel sure about this recursive tree generating function thingy, right now I don't feel 100% sure it's doing the right thing and trying to understand the output with the parenths is making my head hurt
02:36:46 <dminuoso> Think of show/read as data/code serialization/deserialization. =)
02:36:53 <mniip> dexterfoo, it has a few problems due to the GHC api
02:37:22 <c50a326> dminuoso: okay but im not worried about show/read, I'm worried about learning the best techniques to get confidence about functions such as this when writing them (the insert function)
02:37:31 <mniip> GHC isn't very "pure" in the sense that it has a lot of global state that can interfere if you're reloading a haskell module from within a single process
02:38:10 <dminuoso> c50a326: One thing that pops to mind is
02:38:11 <c50a326> maybe I should try to find some stuff on unit tests for recursive tree stuff
02:38:12 <dminuoso> :t notElem
02:38:13 <lambdabot> (Eq a, Foldable t) => a -> t a -> Bool
02:38:26 <dminuoso> c50a326: This thing will usually be much easier to read than trying to compose some usage of `elem` with not.
02:38:46 <c50a326> dminuoso: oh for in parseMessage, okay thanks
02:40:53 <dexterfoo> dminuoso: i suppose another gotcha is if you are not using "-threaded" runtime, and the C function calls your callback from another thread. not sure what would happen :|
02:41:26 <dminuoso> dexterfoo: Mmm fair enough. Ill have to digest a lot of information right now because the library is using c2hs, so I cant directly apply the knowledge at the moment.
02:41:54 <Tordek> any clue on why my build is failing?
02:42:01 <c50a326> dminuoso: but my question is really about testing/checking trees D:
02:42:19 <dminuoso> c50a326: what exactly are you trying to test?
02:42:36 <c50a326> dminuoso: I just want to know it's doing the right thing
02:42:47 <dminuoso> c50a326: and what is the right thing?
02:43:04 <c50a326> well I'm not sure
02:43:09 <c50a326> maybe this: Node (Node (Node Leaf (LogMessage Info 6 "six") (Node Leaf (LogMessage Info 7 "seven") (Node Leaf (LogMessage Info 8 "eight") Leaf))) (LogMessage Info 9 "nine") (Node Leaf (LogMessage Info 10 "ten") (Node Leaf (LogMessage Info 11 "jack") Leaf))) (LogMessage Info 12 "queen") Leaf
02:43:23 <c50a326> but maybe not, it's difficult to assess, that's the problem :(
02:44:22 <dminuoso> c50a326: You asked for a better way to "test this function and output" - in order to help you, you'll have to at least describe the property you are trying to test.
02:46:52 <rkrishnan> I have something like this defined: data X = Foo | Bar and I want to json encode this into "{ \"type\":\"Foo\"}". I have been staring at Aeson haddock docs for a while and just can't figure out how to create a new field with a given name and value as the constructor name.
02:49:35 <c50a326> I think it's correct
02:49:49 <c50a326> I've thought about it more and re-read the insert function, it seems correct and not incorrect
02:50:23 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: perhaps this? toJSON Foo = object [ "type" .: "Foo" ]; toJSON Bar = object [ "type" .: "Bar" ]
02:50:55 <dminuoso> toJSON Foo = object [ "type" .= "Foo" ]; toJSON Bar = object [ "type" .= "Bar" ]
02:51:00 <dminuoso> Wrong operator there. :)
02:53:21 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: So essentially you just need to construct something of type `Value`. Since you stated that you want that value to be an object, you will need to use the `Object :: Object -> Value` constructor. The primitive `object` is to do just that. You give it a list of `Pair` which it uses to construct the object from
02:53:31 <CoolerY> anyone here use repl.it?
02:53:48 <CoolerY> i think they only print something to the console if you print a new line character
02:54:02 <CoolerY> so putStr doesn't print anything but putStrLn does
02:54:34 <liste> rkrishnan: check out https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.4.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:SumEncoding
02:56:04 <rkrishnan> dminuoso: I am trying to use Generic to derive the encoding automatically. Yes, using "object" works fine. Sorry, I should have mentioned that.
02:58:09 <rkrishnan> liste: I am playing with it without much success. I gave the TaggedObject with tagFieldName = "foo" and contentsFieldName = "foobar", but it simply encodes the Constructor name alone in the output.
02:58:30 <rkrishnan> I will play around with more.
03:04:00 <Boomerang> CoolerY: Maybe you could try: `hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering` :)
03:04:07 <sm[m]> CoolerY: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/System-IO.html#g:12
03:04:40 <Boomerang> Or `hFlush` :)
03:04:43 <ij> Can I return from function early like in imperative languages with do?
03:05:07 <Taneb> ij: the short answer is "no"
03:05:40 <ij> gotta wrap it in when then
03:06:09 <liste> :t if not _now then when
03:06:10 <lambdabot> error:
03:06:10 <lambdabot>     parse error (possibly incorrect indentation or mismatched brackets)
03:06:22 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: Im not exactly sure what the problem is. With generics you could just do `instance forall c. (Constructor c) => GenericToLdap (C1 c U1) where toJSON = object [ type .= con ] where con = conName (undefined :: C1 c U1)` ?
03:06:37 <Boomerang> Well thanks to lazyness you can get the result earlier sometimes: f = cheapCheck && expensiveCheck
03:06:42 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: Or what am I missing?
03:13:08 <dminuoso> > liftA2 (+) (*2) (*3) 6
03:13:10 <lambdabot>  30
03:17:55 <halogenandtoast> If I have a table lists and a table tasks that have a foreign key to lists is there a suggested way to get all the lists and all the tasks, the List structure I have is currently List Int Text Text [Task]
03:18:39 <halogenandtoast> using PostgreSQL simple
03:38:08 <c50a326> hey I'm just in the middle of typing this: let errors = [| msg <- inOrder msgs, (LogMessage mt ts s) <- msg ]
03:38:33 <c50a326> is this bit at the end going to be valid tho? I mean how can I use patterns to destructure a type within a list comprehension as part of a predicate?
03:39:10 <phadej> [ ... | LogMessage mt ts s <- inOrder msgs ]
03:39:31 <c50a326> ah yeah ofc
03:39:33 <c50a326> ty
03:39:36 <phadej> cheers
03:40:32 <c50a326> oh but I actually want to return the msg still
03:40:55 <c50a326> but I need to check the type of `LogMessage MessageType TimeStamp String`, so I need to check the MessageType but still return the full message
03:41:01 <Boomerang> c50a326: msg@(LogMessage mt ts s) <- ...
03:41:17 <c50a326> ah yeah, thanks
03:41:17 <amx> halogenandtoast: I'd do something like: SELECT ..., ARRAY(SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = l.task_id),... FROM lists l and then write a FromField instance for [Task]
03:42:49 <amx> which would basically read: fromField f v = fromPGArray <$> fromField f v
03:45:04 <halogenandtoast> amx: interesting, thanks!
03:48:30 * hackage fromhtml 0.1.0.0 - Simple library for transformation of HTML to other formats  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fromhtml-0.1.0.0 (MarekSuchanek)
03:53:21 <rkrishnan> dminuoso: I was trying to see if the data type with constructors that does not take parameters like "data Foo = A | B" can be encoded into an object { "type": "A" } by generic derivation.. It always gives me a String instead of an Object. Anyway, I think it is a bit of an overkill for this simple type. I will just manually derive it.
03:54:53 <rkrishnan> dminuoso: looking at the aeson documentation, if allNullaryToStringTag is False, it should honour sumEncoding. But I don't see it happening.
03:55:31 <halogenandtoast> amx: How would you fromField a task though, it's multiple columns?
03:56:02 <rkrishnan> dminuoso: or may be I am misinterpreting the docs on what "nullary" constructor mean.
03:56:46 <rkrishnan> dminuoso: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.4.0.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:Options
03:59:39 <Tordek> I'm trying to build Taffybar from source, but I get it to this point nad I get a "perhaps you need to add 'time' to the build-depends" https://dpaste.de/8NSg but the dependency is already there
04:02:02 <halogenandtoast> @hoogle (a -> b) -> [a] -> [(b, [a])]
04:02:03 <lambdabot> Util unzipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [(a, b)] -> [c]
04:02:03 <lambdabot> Data.List.Split chop :: ([a] -> (b, [a])) -> [a] -> [b]
04:02:03 <lambdabot> Data.List.Split.Internals chop :: ([a] -> (b, [a])) -> [a] -> [b]
04:02:36 <halogenandtoast> hmm
04:05:27 <Tordek> seems to have been an issue between ghc picking time-1.6 for some reason, and a misdeclaration of the dependency on time as >=1.4 when it should have been >=1.8...
04:07:03 <lyxia> rkrishnan: https://lpaste.net/8558403613582426112 I see {\"tag\":\"A\"}
04:08:26 <c50a326> how do you write a map Function to map [LogMessage X Y String] to just [String] as it is in the third value
04:09:06 <Tordek> c50a326: f (LogMessage _ _ m) = m
04:09:33 <Tordek> (and then map f)
04:09:34 <rkrishnan> lyxia: wow! Thanks. I need to understand what is going on here then. For one, I am using genericToEncoding.
04:09:44 <Boomerang> c50a326: Is it a record? Does it have a field name? Otherwise you can do it as Tordek said: `map (\(LogMessage _ _ m) -> m)`
04:09:46 <c50a326> ah I'll try that but in a lambda
04:09:54 <lyxia> rkrishnan: you always need at least genericToJSON

04:16:54 <CoolerY> is there a regex library in the standard libraries?
04:17:03 <CoolerY> for some basic regexing
04:17:12 <mniip> what do you think you need regex for?
04:17:23 <CoolerY> so i can do this on repl.it instead of in my machine
04:17:46 <CoolerY> repl.it doesn't yet support libraries for haskell
04:18:26 <mniip> not sure I understand
04:18:56 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: Do want to influence the behavior of sum types with non-nullary constructors?
04:19:13 <dminuoso> rkrishnan: A nullary constructor is what you have. Its a constructor taking no arguments.
04:20:43 <rkrishnan> lyxia: thanks a lot, that worked. Thanks a lot.

04:21:21 <c50a326> hey whatWentWrong is producing an empty list unexpectedly https://lpaste.net/3788472939632918528 how can I test if its input is empty when ran?
04:21:41 <c50a326> is there the equivalent of putting a print statement somewhere for debugging purposes?
04:22:27 <c50a326> I know there isn't something like a print statement, but is there something similar?
04:22:56 <cocreature> c50a326: take a look at the functions in Debug.Trace
04:25:35 <dminuoso> c50a326: You could alternatively look into QuickCheck, if applicable.
04:25:54 <dminuoso> c50a326: Or rather do it *as well* :P
04:28:23 <c50a326> cool thanks
05:15:39 <shafox> I have a data type as this ```data Field = Field {
05:15:39 <shafox>     name :: T.Text
05:15:39 <shafox>     value :: T.Text,
05:15:39 <shafox>     binValue :: BSL.ByteString
05:15:39 <shafox> } deriving (Eq, Show, Read)``` How do I create a field using ghci, if I try f = Field "id" "some value" I get error for Couldn't match expected type ‘Data.Text.Internal.Text with actual type ‘[Char]’
05:16:25 <cocreature> shafox: :set -XOverloadedStrings
05:16:47 <cocreature> or use Text.pack
05:18:54 <shafox> cocreature:  Thanks setting that in the ghci worked.
05:19:54 <shafox> if I have unfinished record, I cannot do this "show f" as per the example that I have provided.
05:20:20 <cocreature> that’s because you can’t show a function of type ByteString -> Field
05:21:07 <shafox> exactly the same error I am getting in the console.
05:22:19 <shafox> May i know how it got calculated to ByteString -> Field ?
05:22:51 <cocreature> your Field constructor has type Text -> Text -> ByteString -> Field because those are the types of its arguments
05:23:05 <cocreature> so after you pass the two text arguments you are left with ByteString -> Field
05:29:00 <shafox> cocreature: this worked: I changed the binValue to Maybe ByteString, and created f = Field "id" "some value" Nothing and show f printed all the values including the Nothing.
05:31:07 <CoolerY> is there a isInteger function? can't find it on hoogle
05:31:17 <CoolerY> in the basic libraries

05:31:35 <CoolerY> isInteger :: String -> Bool
05:31:47 <CoolerY> check if the string is a valid integer

05:53:39 <c50a326> line 2 is completely wrong, damn im bad at this
05:53:40 <dminuoso> c50a326: It might be more idiomatic to write some "info" parser, some "warning" parser and some "error" parser.

06:10:52 <cocreature> dminuoso: iirc the problem is that they get applied globally somehow but they need to be applied to a specific package
06:11:07 <cocreature> dminuoso: so try specifying it for the specific package in cabal.project/cabal.project.local
06:12:46 <dminuoso> cocreature: So I'd have to clone the package and build it from hand?
06:13:26 <merijn> dminuoso: No you can specify that in the cabal.project of *your* code for the dependency
06:13:31 <cocreature> dminuoso: no, you can specify options for packages from hackage, e.g., https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nix-local-build.html#configuring-builds-with-cabal-project shows how to disable optimizations for cryptohash

06:30:15 <dminuoso> merijn: It's the beginning of CIS194
06:34:56 <CoolerY> does ghc compile to wasm?
06:35:09 <merijn> CoolerY: There's a bunch of work-in-progress
06:38:28 <CoolerY> merijn, would that make stuff like http://www.purescript.org/ obsolete?
06:38:51 <tdammers> CoolerY: not necessarily
06:39:13 <tdammers> Haskell will never allow for the kind of seamless back-and-forth integration with existing JS libraries that you can get with PS
06:39:57 <CoolerY> tdammers, why not
06:40:36 <merijn> CoolerY: "maybe"?
06:40:42 <c50a326> is Maybe a monad thingy?
06:40:48 <merijn> CoolerY: Different programming models
06:40:53 <c50a326> I haven't actually covered Maybe's yet, they seem to get covered with monads and stuff?
06:40:55 <merijn> c50a326: And a functor and an applicative, yes
06:41:40 <CoolerY> maybe not seamless integration, but code compiled to wasm can interface with javascript
06:41:54 <c50a326> so can I test a String argument for being readable as an Int using read, without getting into monads and all that?
06:42:07 <tdammers> yes, but in order to run Haskell correctly, you essentially need to have a runtime that takes control
06:42:27 <tdammers> whereas Purescript was designed to fit in with JS's runtime semantics
06:42:29 <merijn> CoolerY: Sure, but interfacing and "seamless integration" are not the same thing ;)
06:42:29 <CoolerY> elm interfaces with javascript libraries through ports
06:42:36 <merijn> c50a326: Sure
06:42:47 <tdammers> it's one of the reasons why Purescript isn't lazy-by-default
06:42:48 <merijn> c50a326: All you need is pattern matching, tbh
06:42:56 <CoolerY> merijn, i know
06:43:42 <tdammers> in PS, you can just write a Javascript function, and then the PS wrapper code is essentially just a type signature for that function and a keyword that says to look for it in the FFI code
06:43:57 <tdammers> and it works, because the semantics of "calling a function" are more or less the same
06:44:32 <wz1000> haskell has ffi syntax too
06:44:37 <wz1000> that works pretty much like
06:44:38 <wz1000> that

07:39:38 <Profpatsch> How do I lift a function of arbtitrary many arguments into a monadic context?
07:39:57 <Profpatsch> e.g. (a -> b) -> a -> m b or (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> m c

07:42:36 <infinisil> Sounds like type level stuff
07:42:57 <Profpatsch> I’d guess it’s just a slight abuse of currying.
07:43:08 <Profpatsch> But it drives me crazy that I have to apply manually. :)
07:43:25 <infinisil> Well currying is also just defined over certain arities

07:46:27 <merijn> c50a326: If you change them to "Just time <- readMaybe timestamp" it should work
07:46:31 <c50a326> oh, the problem is different than I thought?
07:47:04 <c50a326> I mean what happens if you match (x:y:z:xs) against words "a b c" which only has 3 words? i should be like "a":"b":"c":[] shouldn't it?
07:47:14 <c50a326> that's words the function btw
07:47:18 <c50a326> (words "a b c")
07:47:40 <c50a326> so x y and z are obviously "a" "b" and "c"
07:47:44 <merijn> c50a326: That's exactly what happens, yes
07:47:49 <c50a326> but actually what if I pass "a b"
07:47:59 <c50a326> does that cause an error or what?
07:48:05 <merijn> c50a326: The use of pattern guards for that pattern match is rather awkward, though
07:48:07 <lyxia> Profpatsch: There are some ways of doing that, the main difference is in how to decide how many argument a function has. In your last example, what if c is an arrow type?
07:48:12 <merijn> c50a326: That fails and falls through to the next guard
07:48:43 <c50a326> what if I did let (x:y:z:xs) = ws in
07:49:06 <ventonegro> Profpatsch: can't think of one
07:50:10 <Profpatsch> lyxia: Right

07:53:50 <merijn> readMaybe never throws that exception
07:54:02 <merijn> c50a326: That exception means you're using read somewhere

09:02:44 <maerwald> sure
09:09:46 <Profpatsch> Hm, design question.
09:10:00 <Profpatsch> I want to build a data structure for a content addressable store.
09:10:17 <Profpatsch> So one interpretation could be to put it in the file system, using IO
09:10:34 <Profpatsch> Another could be to use a HashMap, in Memory.
09:11:44 <Profpatsch> Now I’d have a constructor fileSystemCAS :: FilePath -> IO (CAS a)
09:12:31 <Profpatsch> and one memoryCAS :: (Hashable k, Eq k, Monad m) => m (CAS a)
09:13:30 <Profpatsch> Where m could be Identity, but now the user has to wrap everything in runIdentity everytime they want to use the pure instance.
09:14:17 <Profpatsch> Basically I want the CAS to be defined by its interface, with multiple backends.
09:15:19 <Profpatsch> One idea is to expose another module Data.ContentAddressable.Memory that exposes all pure functions manually and does the wrappping/unwrapping of Identity in every function.
09:23:06 <dminuoso> Im writing a library to interact with a heterogenous network landscape. Overall there's a common theme to what I want to do: "check port status, set port status, provision a *product* onto the hardware". That last step majorly differs from hardware to hardware.
09:23:52 <dminuoso> For that last part Im not sure whether to start off with typeclasses or a big sum type, and then have some `provision :: Profile -> NetworkDevice -> IO ()` that does a big case switch for various network device types
09:25:31 <geekosaur> records of functions?
09:25:47 <dminuoso> geekosaur: Isnt that a typeclass? ;)
09:25:52 <dminuoso> Or an instance rather
09:26:00 <geekosaur> more explicit, which sometimes means more flexible
09:26:31 <geekosaur> for one, you can't readily "subclass" an existing instance the way you can thatDevice {someAction = slightAlternative }
09:26:32 <dminuoso> I mean I do demand some laws, such as idemopotency, or that if you put something in, that you get the same thing out afterwards..
09:26:52 <dminuoso> mmm
09:28:58 <dminuoso> geekosaur: What would be wrong with typeclasses? I mean Im not keen to using them, but Im trying to figure out at what point I should be careful to not abuse them
09:29:03 <lyxia> you can put laws on records the same way as on type classes
09:31:03 <geekosaur> dminuoso, the biggest is what I just said: you can override on case-to-case basis and build new "instances" from existing ones more easily
09:31:33 <geekosaur> there's also the option of parameterizing the records in ways that are harder and trickier with typeclasses because everything's more implicit there

09:36:23 <geekosaur> there's also the possibility of using implicit parameters, giving you something that's somewhere between the implicit nature of typeclasses and the explicit one of records
09:36:49 <glguy> c50a326: You can type "quickcheck" into the search box on hackage.haskell.org
09:37:11 <glguy> The correctly capitalized names of packages will show up in the search results
09:50:54 <akr> Long shot, but does there happen to exist a sort of a reverse-dependency lookup tool, where I input a package name (from hackage) and get a list of packages that (under transitive closure) depend on this?
09:51:37 <akr> (I have once again entered dependency hell and can't figure out for what reason is cabal trying to install a certain package that's not mentioned in the .cabal file)
09:51:40 <lyxia> http://packdeps.haskellers.com/reverse
09:51:58 <akr> :O
09:52:02 <lyxia> it's easy to google
09:52:28 <akr> hmm, yeah
09:52:48 <akr> thanks
09:53:11 <akr> wait
09:53:17 <akr> that doesn't include transitive dependencies
09:53:18 <Welkin> *search online
09:53:38 <Welkin> it's unfortunate that "google" has come to mean "search online"
09:53:57 <Clint> yes
09:55:42 <Welkin> the last time I actually used google to search for anything was many years ago
10:02:02 <sclv> akr: if you do a new-build
10:02:19 <sclv> you can look at plan.json in dist-newstyle/cache/plan.json
10:02:36 <sclv> and grep it for the package you're looking for, and it'll list what depends on it
10:02:49 <akr> sclv: for that I would first have to fix my dependency hell
10:04:36 <tabaqui1> can you tell me, why this code causes fd leak?
10:04:38 <tabaqui1> https://pastebin.com/6BRHvDvQ
10:05:12 <tabaqui1> I use tail recursion and unclosed socket must be collected, but it isn't
10:06:22 <glguy> GC doesn't close the socket
10:06:58 <tabaqui1> well, doesn't Network.Socket use wearkrefs?
10:07:11 <tabaqui1> *does
10:08:34 <tabaqui1> I found similar thing with Network.TLS: the whole code was wrapped in "catches" but one exception still breaks through
10:08:50 <glguy> worth reporting to that package, then
10:09:05 <tabaqui1> oh, ok
10:09:57 <dmwit> I don't see "weak" anywhere in the source for Network.Socket or Network.Socket.Internal.
10:10:16 <dmwit> I'm not super sure why that would matter anyway.
10:10:53 <tabaqui1> if Network.Socket doesn't use weak then GC will not close handles, indeed
10:11:29 <tabaqui1> still wondering why it is not implemented
10:15:27 <dmwit> But, like, weak references just change *when* the GC collects something, not *what* it does when it's collected.
10:15:56 <dmwit> So it doesn't affect the claim "GC doesn't close the socket", which is true whether there's weak references to the socket lying around or not.
10:15:58 <glguy> weak references do take a finalizer action
10:16:09 <glguy> and that finalizer action could be to call close
10:16:22 <dmwit> Okay.
10:16:50 <glguy> There's code around that relies on Sockets not closing their file descriptors when the Socket value disappears, so it would be a non-trivial change
10:20:23 <dmwit> I see. The finalizer actually seems to be a key part of the usefulness, and so I conclude that I once again have not understood weak references.
10:23:49 <shafox> ```
10:23:49 <shafox> data Field = Field {
10:23:49 <shafox>     numericValue :: Num a => a
10:23:49 <shafox> } deriving (Eq, Show, Read)``` I want the numericValue to be a type from Num typeclass. How do I write this ?
10:24:50 <Solonarv> data Field a = Field { fieldValue :: a }
10:24:58 <Solonarv> the Num a constraint goes on the functions using Field
10:25:24 <shafox> Oh. Thanks.
10:31:50 * tabaqui1 is whispering: "rankNtypes"
10:31:52 <geekosaur> shafox, consider that if you were to put the constraint there (there are ways to do so) it would mean you can *only* do the things the Num typeclass specifies to the resulting value
10:32:04 <geekosaur> tabaqui1, you should consider that too
10:33:01 <tabaqui1> yeah, I know existential quantification, just trying to avoid it as much as possible
10:33:22 <shafox> geekosaur: Interesting. what do you mean by this "can *only* do the things the Num typeclass specifies to the resulting value" ? Can you please elaborate ?I am new.
10:33:26 <geekosaur> specifically, it is *not* "Num or any 'subclass'", it is "Num and anything that is fully polymorphic". literally all you know about that value is Num and therefore its typeclass methods
10:33:57 <geekosaur> so you can't use division because that requires more knowledge than Num (either Integral for div, or Fractional for (/))
10:35:57 <geekosaur> Haskell's type system works in some sense "backwards" from common OO typesystems
10:36:06 <geekosaur> at least in this context
10:44:54 <Solonarv> it's not really backwards tbh; if you had an INumber field on a java class you also wouldn't be able to use any methods on it other than INumber ones
10:45:26 <Solonarv> of course you could cast it but you can do that in Haskell as well (with a Typeable constraint)

11:04:47 <geekosaur> guess whatever that bot is changed its "secret knock"
11:05:03 <butterthebuddha> If I want to print something from a function, is returning an IO the only way to achieve that? I ask because for this one particular function, I'd have to return an IO from a dozen other functions that are called in between the function and main
11:05:32 <Welkin> butterthebuddha: Debug.trace
11:05:35 <geekosaur> it's the only reliable and correct way to do it. there's Debug.Trace but you are then subject to lazy evaluation
11:05:47 <Welkin> for debuggin only
11:05:50 <butterthebuddha> I actually am using trace right now, but that seems bad?
11:06:01 <geekosaur> meaning it maybe evaluated at a time you don;t expect, or multiple times (or not at all if it happens not to need it)
11:06:05 <Solonarv> it's fine if you're using it for debugging, that's what it's made for
11:06:07 <Welkin> butterthebuddha: use Writer
11:06:18 <Welkin> write to it like a log and then at some point inside of IO you print it out
11:06:39 <Welkin> unless you are debugging, then use Debug.trace
11:07:09 <butterthebuddha> I was considering that, but I was hoping for an easier way. But Writer is the best reliable way I suppose
11:07:11 <butterthebuddha> Nope, not debugging
11:07:31 <Welkin> interleaving IO with your code is a bad idea
11:07:43 <Welkin> then your whole program will be in IO
11:08:08 <Solonarv> sometimes this is okay but it should be a conscious choice
11:16:37 <dminuoso> butterthebuddha: I found that a lot of my "how to I nicely debug this function" is better covered with quickcheck tests.
11:16:55 <dminuoso> It doesn't always work - but when it does, it beats tracing to assert behavior.

11:30:02 <butterthebuddha> Welkin: I'd like to avoid it, but I don't think I have a choice here; essentially I'm writing an interpreter for lisp, and functions are represented as actual functions in haskell that are called; some functions both print to the screen and return a value though
11:30:36 <butterthebuddha> I may hardcode this and only allow a limited set of functions to have side effects though

11:43:57 <c50a326> you mean putting some line breaks somewhere?
11:45:00 <Welkin> formatting is very flexible
11:45:19 <Welkin> move the let ... in to the next line indented only 2 spaces
11:45:21 <Welkin> for example
11:45:49 <Welkin> then you can further break up the list comprehension
11:46:17 <hexagoxel> why use a `map` step just after a list comp?
11:47:03 <Welkin> also, yes you could rewrite that using map and filter
11:47:16 <hexagoxel> or one list comp
11:47:32 <Welkin> I prefer not to use list comprehensions because they are harder to read
11:47:54 <c50a326> yay now it's just in https://i.imgur.com/HQknWFA.png
11:48:14 <c50a326> yeah maybe I should just not use a list comp
11:48:47 <mnoonan> just do "LogMessage (Error i) _ str <- etc etc"
11:48:59 <mnoonan> no need for a separate toStr thingy
11:50:43 <c50a326> oh yeah, true, the whole thing can just be [str | (LogMessage (Error i) _ str) <- inOrder $ build msgs, i >= 50]
12:36:26 <shapr> last week's Haskell Weekly linked to an article about reducing Docker build times with Shake
12:36:48 <shapr> but it's a bunch of slides, and I don't understand enough to try it out in a large work project
12:37:01 <shapr> Does anyone know of more info or a tutorial for such a thing?
13:29:00 <c50a326> shapr: https://shakebuild.com/manual
13:29:31 <c50a326> which I just found here http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake
13:30:48 <shapr> https://github.com/swift-nav/shake-before-make/blob/0a47f66015a1cf4f742f2c938b3d75c1ff070ac9/Shake.pdf was in the previous haskell weekly
13:31:11 <shapr> c50a326: yeah, I'll read through the manual, see if that helps me, thanks
13:53:03 <hololeap> i see what `fix` does, but i'm curious when it is actually more useful than explicitly recursing. here is an example:
13:53:08 <hololeap> myFunc i = func where func s = if s == i then s else func (s+1)
13:53:32 <hololeap> myFixFunc i = fix func where func loop s = if s == i then s else loop (s+1)
13:53:52 <glguy> It's useful when you didn't want to define a top-level name
13:54:16 <glguy> or you wanted to apply fix to some arbitrary expression
13:58:24 <hololeap> ok, is there another way to shorten/tighten/refactor this `iterator` function, or is that about as good as it gets? http://dpaste.com/0XW16K9
14:13:47 <__monty__> shapr: The manual has nothing specific to docker afaik.

14:49:12 <lukelau> Can you derive instances for data types that are imported from another module?
14:50:25 <geekosaur> standalone deriving. but beware of orphan instances if you're making a library
14:51:02 <geekosaur> it's kinda impolite to cause behavior of other programs to change on importing a module that doesn't define either the class or the instanced type of an instance
14:51:03 <glguy> https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-StandaloneDeriving
14:51:17 <geekosaur> ^ which I was getting to but wanted to get that warning out first
14:52:20 <lukelau> If its just for an application should that be ok?
14:52:53 <geekosaur> yes
14:53:10 <lukelau> It’s just for an Ord instance
14:53:39 <lukelau> How does it choose which order to compare properties in for the derived instance anyway?
14:55:00 <lukelau> I would be happy writing the instance by hand, but was wondering if there was some sort of function for chaining comparisons as a fallback
14:55:07 <lukelau> something like sortBy (\a b -> foo a `compare` foo b then bar a `compare` bar b)
14:55:29 <Rembane> lukelau: Use the monoid instance.
14:55:33 <geekosaur> ^
14:55:59 <Rembane> lukelau: foo a `compare` foo b <> bar a `compare` bar b
14:56:07 <Rembane> lukelau: And take a look at on in Data.Function.
14:59:09 <glguy> or even: comparing foo <> comparing snd

15:06:43 <concaveirc> Hi all, I have a stack project which uses sdl as well as data files.
15:07:20 <concaveirc> Is there a way I can send a friend a binary or installer of sorts which would cover the system and data dependencies?
15:17:00 * hackage these-skinny 0.7.4 - A fork of the 'these' package without the dependency bloat.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/these-skinny-0.7.4 (chessai)
15:19:44 <infinisil> concaveirc: Static compilation is the thing you probably want
15:20:00 <infinisil> But I don't know how to do this with stack, you should find info online about it though
15:20:24 <concaveirc> Yeah, I saw someone mention stack image container, so I am looking at that now.
15:21:33 <concaveirc> Looks like image container does not create a static binary but something else.
15:27:21 <geekosaur> sttaic binary doesn't help with e.g. data files. image containers do, but you then have to run docker to use them
15:27:43 <Solonarv> just pack everything into one folder and send that
15:28:05 <Solonarv> if it works for itch.io it'll work for you
15:29:51 <infinisil> Static compilation can't bundle data files?
15:30:08 <infinisil> Didn't know that
15:30:35 <infinisil> If you were to use Nix, I'd suggest to use https://github.com/matthewbauer/nix-bundle :)
15:31:59 <Solonarv> there's a library somewhere that can hook into the build process and pack data into your binary
15:34:26 <geekosaur> it "coukld" if you turned the data files into built-in data and had it write them out on first run… but then, aside from bloating your binaries, there comes the question of why have the data files at all
15:36:24 <Solonarv> "throw everything into a folder" is definitely the simplest solution
15:36:51 <Solonarv> It's how I package my game currently and I don't see myself changing it anytime soo

18:06:59 <glguy> Is there a (B.take size b1) missing on the last line?
18:07:38 <butterthebuddha> glguy: nope; b1 is supposed to be an infinite bytestring
18:13:06 <dmj`> butterthebuddha: is there an ‘e’ missing on line 3?
18:13:29 <butterthebuddha> dmj`: whoops, missed it when I coped the code over
18:14:32 <dmj`> butterthebuddha: diffing on an infinite list will take a long time I imagine
18:15:00 <butterthebuddha> dmj`: b2 is not infinite; the diffing stops when b2 runs out
18:29:15 <halogenandtoast> I'm pretty unhappy with this line and I was wondering if anyone had any pointers on how to do this better? https://gist.github.com/halogenandtoast/d444f359fa30256d01795d4a9800ef23#file-lib-hs-L137
18:29:49 <halogenandtoast> I'm pretty unhappy with a lot of the code to be honest, but figured I'd start there
18:30:27 <Solonarv> break it up into multiple lines is a good start
18:30:31 <glguy> fromListWith (flip (++)) is the inefficient way around. Hopefully you aren't expecting the lists to get very long
18:30:58 <glguy> work on naming more things so the lines are shorter and more digestible
18:32:08 <halogenandtoast> glguy: I don't think the lists would get very long, but at the same time I don't mind being more efficient
18:35:37 <Solonarv> you can completely eliminate the list comprehension by just doing that work in the fmap (\task -> ...) part
18:36:22 <Solonarv> and then you don't need to wrap Map.fromListWith in a lambda
18:37:52 <halogenandtoast> I've updated it to group things slightly better
18:38:13 <halogenandtoast> I don't see how I can make the (Int, [Task]) structure without the list comprehension
18:38:29 <halogenandtoast> or in (\task -> ) since it needs more than one task
18:38:39 <Solonarv> map (\task -> (taskListId task, [task])) -- notice the brackets
18:38:42 <halogenandtoast> I guess I could build the (Int, [Task]) with a single task
18:38:43 <halogenandtoast> right
18:39:24 <Solonarv> I personally wouldn't have added top-level bindings, just locally let-bound an intermediate result or two
18:41:18 <halogenandtoast> Updated again, slightly better
18:41:43 <halogenandtoast> and yeah I'll likely move it back under and not top-level
18:41:51 <halogenandtoast> I just find it easier to focus on a part by moving it out
18:42:54 <Solonarv> at this point you can probably inline makeTasksMap tbh
18:43:27 <Solonarv> there's also a <&> operator somewhere which is just flip (<$>)
18:44:16 <Solonarv> sometimes that's more readable than <$>
18:45:01 <jackdk> I wish that appeared in base's Data.Functor
18:45:27 <Solonarv> yeah, that'd be nice
18:45:41 <Solonarv> the only package I know of that exports it is lens and, well...
18:45:59 <siraben> Are there some exercises for using monads?
18:46:13 <siraben> Or problems where using monads could be most useful
18:47:52 <halogenandtoast> siraben: You can always try building a web app. I feel like that hits a lot of monads
18:48:03 <halogenandtoast> having to deal with logging, databases, settings, etc.
18:48:06 <siraben> halogenandtoast: Something simpler perhaps?
18:48:12 <siraben> I don't have experience with web dev yet
18:49:15 <halogenandtoast> siraben: so one of the difficult things is that there probably aren't a lot of useful exercises using monads. You'd probably want to focus on a single monad at a time.
18:49:34 <halogenandtoast> How familiar are you with the fairly "normal" monads?
18:49:52 <halogenandtoast> Like Maybe, Either, [] ?
18:50:38 <siraben> So far only the examples in  http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/monad-in-Scheme.html
18:50:46 <siraben> It has Scheme and Haskell code
18:51:06 <siraben> It's still hard for me to think in Haskell,
18:51:22 <siraben> The example it gave was creating a tree with uniquely numbered nodes.
18:51:38 <siraben> In an imperative world you could use a global variable and mutate it, but instead you can use a monad
18:51:49 <siraben> I'm not sure what this monad is called.
18:51:58 <Solonarv> State, usually
18:52:29 <siraben> I wrote a fibonacci function that keeps track of how many times it was called
18:52:49 <siraben> But I heard that monads can be used to trace execution as well?
18:53:25 <Solonarv> they can be used for a *lot* of things
18:54:24 <siraben> Many monad tutorials make confusing analogies.  From what I understand a monad is simply a computation wrapped in lambda expression that waits for a state
18:54:55 <Solonarv> that is one sort of monad, yes
18:55:02 <siraben> Then bind takes a monad and a function, and "steps" the computation and wraps the result in a monad again
18:55:03 <Solonarv> but not all monads are state-ish
18:55:17 <halogenandtoast> In my book of lies I just say a monad is something that responds to (>>=) and obeys some laws that I always forget
18:55:37 <siraben> So monads are nicely composable, feels a lot like "hooks" in some languages
18:56:27 <siraben> How do monads relate to things like generators and streams?
18:56:44 <Solonarv> "Generator" is a monad (usually), and so is Stream
18:58:40 <siraben> What I'm enjoying is the type annotations and the ability to make your own types
19:00:05 <suzu> i have been programming in haskell for like a year
19:00:11 <suzu> i am absolutely spoiled by it and can't go back
19:00:50 <siraben> How can I understand delimited and undelimited continuations?
19:06:58 <Solonarv> I'm not sure what an undelimited continuation would even be
19:11:28 --- mode: ChanServ set +o copm
19:11:38 --- mode: ChanServ set +l 1
