00:00:05 <dormoose> blackh: Thanks!
00:00:11 <blackh> dormoose: You should be able to read stdin/stdout as ByteStrings, just use the handle called stdin/stdout from the System.IO package.
00:00:24 <luqui> mm_freak, yeah possibly.  quantum-arrow, as one of my first modules, and me not knowing all that much about QM, is kind of a novelty module :-)
00:00:31 <blackh> dormoose: The Wiki page on import is really helpful.
00:01:13 <mm_freak> luqui: well, i thought of rewriting it as a monad and using the vector-space package to make things less abstract
00:01:47 <luqui> mm_freak, yeah, and that is a fine solution if you aren't doing any inline observation.
00:01:57 <luqui> which admittedly is kind of the novelty part anyway :-)
00:02:37 <mm_freak> luqui: i wonder whether you need an arrow/monad at all for that
00:02:50 <dormoose> blackh: I'm using BS.import
00:02:55 <mm_freak> data Quantum v, where v is a vector space
00:03:00 <glguy> mmorrow,
00:03:01 <glguy> http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=983#a984
00:03:29 <luqui> mm_freak, well yeah, I mean, QM is really just linear algebra over the complex field.
00:03:59 <luqui> in principle at least
00:04:00 <mm_freak> add calculus for continuous state
00:04:29 <luqui> the *algebra* part of linear algebra :-).  matrices are for chumps.
00:04:47 <mm_freak> i don't consider integrals linear =)
00:04:54 <luqui> mm_freak, oh but they are!
00:05:10 <luqui> mm_freak, both integrals and derivatives are linear transformations.
00:05:26 <glguy> mmorrow, the definition of reset fits the monadlib pattern for RunContM
00:05:40 <luqui> int(a + b) = int a + int b ; int (k a) = k int a
00:05:47 <glguy> so that one will be easy to get in (and it is nifty that it just happens to fit the bill here)
00:05:52 <mm_freak> oh, indeed
00:06:02 <int80_h> luqui: why they make lower division students into chumps? why why?
00:06:31 <luqui> int80_h, I just don't like the common misconception that linear algebra = matrices.
00:06:44 <luqui> maybe it's not a misconception.  just a popular conception.
00:07:12 <int80_h> it could be that way because all most people ever see of linear algebra is what they do sophomore year. which is matrices...
00:07:20 <int80_h> and hate it
00:07:24 <int80_h> it's so boring
00:07:37 <mmorrow> glguy: interesting
00:08:06 <glguy> mmorrow, so I'll ask Iavor about adding RunContM tomorrow
00:08:15 <mmorrow> very cool :)
00:08:18 <glguy> and we'll have the tools to defining generic shift and reset
00:08:27 <glguy> that can float up and down the transformer stack
00:08:31 <mmorrow> woot
00:08:43 <mmorrow> i've gotta start using monadLib exclusively
00:09:12 <mm_freak> luqui: since i learned the math myself, i know that matrices are just part of the story =)
00:10:18 <mmorrow> i'm gonna get it in scope in lunabot too. just have to make sure i hide all lift
00:11:26 <int80_h> besides alebraic topology, what's a good math background for an undergrad. In terms of haskell
00:11:32 <int80_h> I mean, algebraic
00:11:55 <mmorrow> heh, i just saw your new def of shift
00:12:08 <mmorrow> slick ;)
00:12:31 <dormoose>     Couldn't match expected type `BS.ByteString'
00:12:31 <dormoose>            against inferred type `Data.ByteString.Lazy.Internal.ByteString'
00:12:40 <dormoose> (BS is the qualified import for Data.ByteString
00:12:56 <int80_h> I knew it was BS
00:13:06 <dormoose> .. intentional ..
00:13:10 <int80_h> heh heh
00:13:41 <luqui> mm_freak, fwiw:  http://paste.lisp.org/display/74337
00:13:41 <int80_h> was my question onsensical?
00:13:47 <blackh> dormoose: Lazy bytestrings are a different type to normal ones, but you can convert between them.
00:13:47 <mmorrow> int80_h: so you've taken the two-semester algebra course?
00:14:11 <int80_h> mmorrow: nope, plotting my course. abstract algebra is on it.
00:14:14 <mmorrow> (not speaking in terms of haskell)
00:14:25 <mmorrow> nice. yeah, take that for sure
00:14:33 <dormoose> blackh: Well, the convert I'm using here wants lazy ByteStrings, so I guess I must cater to it? How?
00:14:39 <glguy> mmorrow, I think that the new version actually makes it clear what is going on
00:14:44 <int80_h> so, two semesters of algebra, algebraic topology...
00:14:50 <luqui> int80_h, hard to say.  I think any math will have a high correlation factor to haskell.
00:14:54 <luqui> maybe less on the analysis side...
00:14:58 <int80_h> I mean I like number theory but I can't waste credits...
00:15:11 <mmorrow> glguy: yeah, i really dig that way of defining it.
00:15:11 <blackh> dormoose: fromChunks and toChunks in Data.ByteString.Lazy
00:15:20 <luqui> but who knows, there might be some beautiful analysis hiding in haskell (see sigfpe's stuff for a little of it)
00:15:25 <dormoose> Gosh. How difficult everything is.
00:15:36 <lgas> mmorrow: the magic incantation I needed was just "ghc -package GLUT file.hs"
00:15:38 <glguy> mmorrow, OHHh
00:15:47 <glguy> I *knew* there were too many resets in there
00:15:52 <glguy> suspend $ k -> reset $ ...
00:15:55 <glguy> that reset doesn't do anything
00:15:57 <lgas> (no -l, -L, DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATHs etc)
00:16:03 <mmorrow> glguy: ahhh
00:16:06 <mm_freak> luqui: what about discrete states?
00:16:11 <mm_freak> uhm, sorry
00:16:13 <luqui> mm_freak, what do you mean?
00:16:14 <mm_freak> luqui: what about nondiscrete states?
00:16:26 <mm_freak> like the position of a particle
00:16:37 <glguy> mmorrow, reset set's the point that an abort will jump to
00:16:58 <glguy> so now we have two, which makes sense
00:17:01 <luqui> mm_freak, well, first, your vector has infinite dimension, so a simple scalar is not enough to rotate.  you need some sort of infinite tensor.
00:17:03 <glguy> the one explicit one
00:17:09 <glguy> and the one inside the shift
00:17:12 <glguy> to return back in
00:17:19 <int80_h> luqui: well I hear alot of special terminology in this channel. And I know math is so specialized it's possible for one mathematician to not understand another mathematician. I can take perhaps 18 credits of math. Maybe 24 if I can wrangle a bit. I want thpose credits to count
00:17:20 <mmorrow> interesting
00:17:23 <blackh> dormoose: The various string types are possibly not the best design ever, but they're OK once you get used to them.
00:17:24 <luqui> mm_freak, second, qarrow stores states as lists of values and amplitudes...
00:17:31 <blackh> dormoose: Progress is being made in this area.
00:17:38 <int80_h> I want to speak the language, as it were
00:17:54 <luqui> int80_h, I dunno, most of the language I speak I learned here.
00:18:08 <blackh> dormoose: ...slowly. :)
00:18:09 <int80_h> heh, guess I'll just stick around
00:18:14 <luqui> My field was set theory, and while it helps me think, I don't really use it in these discussions.
00:18:17 <dormoose> blackh: Ha! I just replaced the BS.interact with Lazy.interact. *poof*
00:18:27 <int80_h> so you asked questions when people used unfamiliar terminology?
00:18:51 <mm_freak> luqui: given a wave function ψ and an operator like ψ(x) ↦ xψ(x) or even ψ(x) ↦ i∂ψ/∂x, is there any way to do that with qarrow?
00:19:06 <luqui> int80_h, aye.   especially rwbarton and edwardk are good at explaining the category theory stuff  :-)
00:19:16 <mmorrow> int80_h: take algebra as early as possible
00:19:24 <luqui> algebra is good stuff :-)
00:19:29 <dormoose> .. while your brains are still malleable
00:19:47 <int80_h> I hope my brains are malleable
00:19:53 <mmorrow> it's a prereq for pretty much everything else, and what it isn't a prereq for it'll still make clearer
00:20:08 <glguy> mmorrow, the extreme! shift = suspend . (. (reset .))
00:20:13 <int80_h> well I have this abstract algebra book sitting in my room
00:20:16 <mmorrow> omg leet!
00:20:20 <dormoose> int80_h: The concern for that is the only thing that keeps me studying Haskell n' stuff. To remain flexible.
00:20:25 <luqui> mm_freak, well the former is a pure arrow isn't it?  the latter I don't think is possible
00:20:38 <luqui> mm_freak, oh wait no it's not
00:21:27 <int80_h> yeah my gf's dad went to berkeley in the 60's. used to program in C professionally. But hasn't in a long time. I'd like him to get into haskell. He was a math major. But I think he's no longer flexible in his thinking
00:21:28 <luqui> mm_freak, yeah, maybe it's possible, maybe it would need tweaks to the module, maybe it's not possible.  You are quickly entering the realm I don't understand
00:22:17 <int80_h> I mean, I told him about the differences, and he said "well I learned how to program proceduraly" as if to dismiss what I was saying. I said "so did I" as if to say "hey  I can learn a new way, so can you!"
00:22:41 <dormoose> (convert "UTF16LE" "UTF-8") str -- works
00:22:49 <dormoose> (Lazy.drop 2) . (convert "UTF16LE" "UTF-8") str -- doesn't. Why?
00:22:54 <luqui> int80_h, if he was a mathematician, maybe approaching haskell as an algebraic system rather than a programming language would be helpful.
00:23:04 <luqui> int80_h, eg. jump right in with domain theory
00:23:22 <int80_h> luqui: heh, he'd be on his own then. over my head. any books to suggest?
00:23:44 <mm_freak> luqui: well, i think, using an arrow is overly special…  i'm sure i can achieve the same using a monad with a simpler interface…  using the vector-space package should solve the problem of continuous states
00:23:49 <luqui> int80_h, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Denotational_semantics
00:24:20 <luqui> mm_freak, yeah, the arrow is only necessary for inline observation.  the rest is plain and simple.
00:24:31 <dormoose> (drop 2) should be of type String -> String, right? Then why can't I write (Lazy.drop 2) . (convert ...) myString ?
00:24:38 <thoughtpolice> woot
00:24:42 <mm_freak> luqui: i have an idea for inline observation using monads
00:24:43 * thoughtpolice finally got cryptol working on linux
00:24:49 <luqui> dormoose, you are missing a $
00:25:12 <luqui> dormoose, that is parsed: (Lazy.drop 2) . (convert ... myString)
00:25:22 <dormoose> luqui: Ohhh. Riiight.
00:25:34 <luqui> mm_freak, ... really?  I'm pretty sure it's not possible.  what's your idea?
00:25:56 <int80_h> luqui: this all looks familiar to me
00:26:03 <int80_h> hmm maybe not over my head
00:26:22 <int80_h> I just heard "domain theory" and was thinking "nope, never heard of it"
00:26:49 <mm_freak> luqui: superpose :: (InnerSpace v, MonadRandom m) => [(Scalar v, v)] -> Quantum m v
00:27:03 <luqui> int80_h, so you know about less-defined and limits, but you've never heard it called domain theory?
00:27:12 <int80_h> right
00:27:29 <mm_freak> luqui: entanglement will be a bit less trivial, though
00:27:46 <luqui> mm_freak, yeah... that's what I mean :-)
00:27:46 <mm_freak> but i'll go to sleep now and work on that later
00:28:13 <mm_freak> well, the reason i want to get rid of arrows is that i don't like them a lot =)
00:28:21 <luqui> I don't like them either
00:28:22 <int80_h> luqui: what I know about limits, and freshmen calculus student knows
00:28:28 <int80_h> s/and/any
00:28:44 <luqui> int80_h, well, domain limits are a little different.  not that different.
00:29:29 <int80_h> luqui: the thing that trips me up is new notation. but this notation I have seen before. So I figure I can understand what's on the page
00:29:47 <luqui> basically if you have a chain of partial values {a,b,c,d,..}, and a <= b <= c <= d <= ...
00:30:17 <int80_h> yes?
00:30:20 <luqui> then there is a limit of this sequence, and furthermore the limit of f(a) <= f(b) <= f(c) <= f(d) <= ...  is f(the limit of {a,b,c,d})
00:30:32 <luqui> that's the big theorem.
00:30:38 <dormoose> blackh: How to use Lazy.split? It wants a Word8 argument and won't take literal '\n'. How to convert?
00:30:54 <int80_h> ah. the fundamental theorem of limits?
00:30:57 <luqui> or maybe it's an assumption.  I don't remember, there are so many different takes.
00:31:23 <int80_h> that is one hell of a complex axiom. I could see it being a theorem though
00:31:24 <luqui> int80_h, well, it's the definition of continuity.
00:31:30 <int80_h> ah!
00:31:57 <luqui> so then domain theory is the study of continuous monotone functions on domains
00:32:05 <int80_h> monotone?
00:32:13 <luqui> a <= b  implies  f(a) <= f(b)
00:32:30 <int80_h> thanks :)
00:33:19 <luqui> and there's really not that much more to it.  all computable functions are continuous and monotone.  and... then you start programming.
00:34:01 <int80_h> luqui: so no computable functions are discrete?
00:37:55 <blackh> dormoose: (Was away fora minute.) You want 'fromIntegral (ord '\n')'
00:38:43 <luqui> int80_h, well, I don't know what a "discrete function" means.
00:39:17 <blackh> dormoose: If you want to avoid all this extra work, use Data.ByteString.Char8, but this doesn't work if you're using a library that wants Data.ByteString, of course.
00:39:18 <int80_h> luqui, okay I have to admit neither do I. As in I couldn't define it formally
00:39:52 <luqui> int80_h, exactly.  eg. "continuous" is a vast generalization of that from real analysis.
00:40:05 <int80_h> but it seems to me and function that uses only integers is a discrete function. Obviously I'm entirely confused on thsi subject.
00:40:34 <int80_h> s/and/a
00:40:36 <luqui> int80_h, well first we are working on domains, so the integers have an extra element: _|_
00:40:52 <dormoose> blackh:  Not in scope: `ord'
00:41:02 <blackh> dormoose: 'ord' is in Data.Char
00:41:05 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: data-spacepart 20090126.0
00:41:06 <redditbot> Notes on the LHC: Typeclasses are working, now we're missing a bunch of instances...
00:41:10 <dormoose> blackh: Oh.
00:41:26 <int80_h> luqui: okay, tell me about _|_
00:41:34 * int80_h goes into eliza mode
00:41:57 <luqui> int80_h, _|_ is an element of every domain (or rather, there is a _|_ in every domain.. doesn't really make sense to call it the same one)
00:42:17 <luqui> int80_h, and _|_ is less defined than every other element of the domain
00:42:58 <luqui> int80_h, so eg. the following is a limit:   _|_, 0:_|_, 0:1:_|_, 0:1:2:_|_, ...
00:43:06 <luqui> er, s/limit/chain/
00:43:26 <luqui> that's only a well defined chain because _|_ <= 0:_|_.  this wouldn't be a chain:  0, 1, 2, 3
00:43:43 <int80_h> luqui, I'm with you so far. If f(a) < f(b) < f(c) then _|_ < f(a)
00:43:45 <luqui> because 0 isn't <= 1,  (nor is 1 <= 0)
00:44:05 <luqui> int80_h, well sure.  _|_ < x for any x.
00:44:22 <luqui> (I guess we've switched to using < for <=)
00:44:39 <luqui> (I still mean it nonstrict, i.e. x < x  is true)
00:45:28 <int80_h> okay, with you so far
00:45:38 <augustss> Don't we have a domain theory page on the wiki?
00:45:47 <int80_h> yes we do
00:45:49 <luqui> yeah, there's a nice wikibook I linked to
00:45:50 <augustss> We should.
00:45:50 <dormoose> blackh: Waaah. Haskell keeps in my way. How to make a Lazy.ByteString containing only a Word8 newline?
00:45:56 <int80_h> luqui just showed it to me
00:46:06 <augustss> ah
00:46:08 <int80_h> that's how we started having this lecture
00:46:26 <luqui> int80_h, yeah, and I'm not really saying anything that isn't there, so you should read it and then ask questions.
00:46:26 <blackh> dormoose: pack [fromIntegral (ord '\n')]
00:46:39 <int80_h> I'm too tire to complete the assignment chessguy gave me anyway, but I can follow along with luqui
00:46:46 <dormoose> blackh: *grumble*
00:46:49 <int80_h> luqui : okay I will
00:47:19 <int80_h> tired*
00:48:39 <blackh> dormoose: Data.ByteString is meant for binary data, whereas Data.ByteString.Char8 is for text.  Can you use Char8 instead?
00:49:58 <rodnaldo> VISIT www.rodnaldo.bloger.hr FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BETTING
00:50:42 <blackh> dormoose: The idea behind Haskell is that it makes itself very annoying while you are trying to compile.  All the pain is up front instead of during debugging.
00:50:50 <mmorrow> @where ops

00:52:22 <dormoose> blackh: I appreciate it. And what do you mean by using Char8 instead? How? I just want to Lazy.split and Lazy.intercalate this thing.
00:53:20 <int80_h> luqui, I have a question about notation. Bear with me, as I cannot mimic it exactly
00:53:24 <blackh> dormoose: You could use the Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 module instead of Data.ByteString.Lazy
00:53:34 <int80_h> but in the discussiion about strictness, for example...
00:54:25 <dormoose> blackh: Oh. Hmm. Lemme try.
00:54:36 <blackh> dormoose: Then everything has to be of that type.  If you need it to be ByteString.Lazy at one point, then you can convert the whole thing then.
00:54:46 <int80_h> I'll see _|_ [= 1. is  [= same as <=?
00:55:16 <blackh> dormoose: Char8 uses Char instead of Word8 so you don't need 'fromIntegral . ord' all the time
00:55:29 <O_4> int80_h: blimey, what's that?
00:55:38 <luqui> int80_h, yeah, I was writing <=, for what the page was writing [=
00:55:47 <int80_h> 0_4: notation from the domain theory page in the wiki book
00:55:54 <int80_h> luqui, oh good.
00:56:19 <dormoose> blackh: Ha. It got rid of that fromIntegral thing, yes.
00:56:32 <int80_h> why can't they just say <= dammit ;)
00:57:06 <int80_h> I got my hands on an old timey topology book from the 19th century. let's just say they had their own notation as well.
00:57:12 <blackh> dormoose: Now you can say: pack "\n"  Much nicer!
00:57:18 <dormoose> blackh: yup
00:57:53 <luqui> int80_h, because it might be confused with <= on the integers; i.e. 1 <= 42.
00:57:55 <luqui> ?
00:58:04 <int80_h> ah!
00:58:09 <dormoose> blackh: Ahhh. At LAST I can get to the point of writing the algo.
00:58:17 <int80_h> okay
01:00:38 <augustss> dormoose: If you use -XOverloadedStrings you can say "\n" instead of (pack "\n")
01:01:00 <dormoose> augustss: I'd rather not, I'll forget that and it'll hurt me later on.
01:04:54 <int80_h> is it bad form to put an underscore in variable names?
01:05:13 <int80_h> I wanted to do something like this Diff_x2x1
01:06:36 <blackh> int80_h: I don't think it's bad form, but what do I know? I use it when there's some "unusual" separation between the two parts.
01:07:52 <augustss> int80_h: Haskell most uses CamelCase, but like blackh I sometimes use _ for special things.
01:09:20 <vegai> I use foo_bar notation for locals
01:09:29 <dolio> There's also Oleg style.
01:09:33 <dolio> names'like'this
01:09:58 <vegai> Oleg is a Goa'uld?!
01:11:02 <int80_h> oh I was doing it for readability
01:11:24 <int80_h> Diffx2x1 or DiffX2X1 looks ugly to me
01:11:59 <augustss> Then use _
01:12:04 <blackh> int80_h: FWIW I would probably use a name like Diff_x2x1. One I used recently was Text_OK, which is the text of an OK button (internationalized).
01:12:16 <dolio> I kind of like scheme's use of hyphens, but losing (-) as an operator would be bad.
01:12:41 <int80_h> cool. chessguy gave me an assignment to reqrite a RWH exercise in idiomatic haskell. I wanted to make sure I was sticking to the idiom
01:12:45 <augustss> dolio: why not spaces in identifiers?
01:12:51 <daf> dolio: surely you could have both
01:12:56 <blackh> Once I submitted some camel case to the Linux kernel.  I didn't realize they had such a thing about camels.
01:13:18 <dolio> augustss: Losing the ' ' operator would be even worse. :)
01:13:29 <int80_h> blackh: maybe there was some unresolved childhood trauma?
01:14:01 <dolio> daf: Not unless it was special cased, with Haskell's identifier rules.
01:14:37 <blackh> int80_h: Someone told me it was Linus. I almost said, "Well, there's this thing called user space. Maybe you've heard of it?"
01:14:41 <daf> dolio: I don't understand
01:15:01 <mmorrow> dolio: what exactly is it that shift/reset for Cont(T) lack shift/reset that cc-delcont/equiv have?
01:15:13 <mmorrow> *..lack _that_ ...
01:15:29 <dolio> daf: Characters either get to be in the prefix identifier category (alphanumeric + ' and _) or the infix identifier category (most symbols).
01:15:50 <mmorrow> i_though_oleg_styl'e_'was_li'ke_this''
01:15:52 <mmorrow> ?
01:16:09 <dolio> mmorrow: cc-delcont lets you use multiple prompts.
01:16:37 <dolio> So 'reset (\p -> ... reset (\q -> ... shift p (\k -> ...)))' aborts all the way up to the first reset.
01:16:42 <mmorrow> dolio: what would be an example that shows something cc-delcont does that the other..
01:16:45 <mmorrow> looking..
01:17:02 <int80_h> later guys...sleep time for int
01:17:02 <mmorrow> ahhh, ok.
01:18:07 <mmorrow> @tell glguy <dolio> So 'reset (\p -> ... reset (\q -> ... shift p (\k -> ...)))' aborts all the way up to the first reset.
01:18:07 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
01:18:53 <dolio> Or, captures I guess. Not aborts. Whatever.
01:19:06 <mmorrow> yeah, i was just wondering about that
01:19:31 <mmorrow> @tell glguy <dolio> Or, captures I guess. Not aborts. Whatever.
01:19:31 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
01:19:32 <mmorrow> :)
01:20:07 <quicksilver> mmorrow: since moonpatio is becoming our defacto hpaste, would be nice to have a bot attached to it
01:20:12 <dolio> cc-delcont has the 'dynamic' control operators, too. Those are kind of a pain to implement for Cont(T).
01:21:17 <int80_h> @tell chessguy okay I started your idiomatic haskell exercise
01:21:17 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
01:21:20 <mmorrow> quicksilver: it would. i think i'm going to have lunabot do it, but before that happens i've got to move hpaste2 to the machine (much faster box) that lunabot's on (and i'll redirect the domain name as well)
01:22:01 <mmorrow> there's a bot that comes with hpaste2, but i don't know howtf to use it ;)
01:22:30 <mmorrow> dolio: you mean like `control'/etc ?
01:22:41 <dolio> Yeah. control, shift0, control0.
01:22:47 <dolio> All the ones from Shift to Control.
01:22:54 <mmorrow> cool
01:22:59 <dolio> , [$ty| shift0 |]
01:23:02 <lunabot>  forall a b c d e . MonadDelimitedCont d e b => d c ->
01:23:02 <lunabot>                                                 ((b a -> b c) -> b c) -> b a
01:23:33 <dolio> Shift to Control shows how to implement them for ContT, I think, but they're more involved than shift/reset.
01:23:43 <goalieca> ?src unfold
01:23:43 <lambdabot> Source not found. Maybe if you used more than just two fingers...
01:24:26 <goalieca> ?src unfoldr
01:24:26 <lambdabot> unfoldr f b  = case f b of
01:24:26 <lambdabot>    Just (a,new_b) -> a : unfoldr f new_b
01:24:26 <lambdabot>    Nothing        -> []
01:24:27 <mmorrow> dolio: but the fundamental no-two-ways-about-it difference is that ContT can't support multiple prompts (?)
01:25:19 <dolio> Or, actually, I think it's not ContT exactly. The type needs to be modified to support the other operators.
01:25:29 <dolio> (One set needs a stack of some sort, for instance.)
01:25:36 <mmorrow> hmm
01:25:40 <dolio> Yeah, the multiple prompts would be the big difference.
01:33:36 <dolio> For instance, the monad with shift0 is: Cont r a = (a -> [Cont r r] -> r) -> r
01:33:40 <dolio> Or something along those lines.
01:34:16 <dolio> Apparently I have something slightly different in my stuff transcribed from the paper a while ago.
01:35:16 <dolio> But it may reduce to that.
01:38:20 <mmorrow> hmm, interesting
01:38:56 <dolio> control uses (a -> Maybe (Cont r r) -> r)
01:39:07 <mmorrow> so then it /could/ be implemented with a Cont variant. it's just that as-is Cont(T) doesn't have the capabilities
01:39:10 <dolio> And control0 uses (a -> Maybe (Cont r r) -> [Cont r r] -> r)
01:39:46 <mmorrow> are all the Conts the one about 10 lines up?
01:40:14 <dolio> No. Each one is 'Cont = ...'.
01:40:21 <mmorrow> ohh
01:40:22 <vegai> was there an empty IO () action... I keep doing putStr ""
01:40:24 <mmorrow> i see
01:40:49 <dolio> return ()
01:41:00 <mmorrow> > return () :: IO ()
01:41:01 <lambdabot>   * Exception: "<IO ()>"
01:41:02 <vegai> oh, of course.
01:41:05 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: level-monad 0.2
01:41:07 <redditbot> Memoization in GHC
01:41:37 <dolio> mmorrow: I think it's been proved that you can implement all the others with shift/reset somehow. But I don't remember the specifics about that.
01:41:45 <dolio> Even though that seems unlikely.
01:41:58 <mmorrow> yeah, i think i read that somewhere too
01:42:26 <dolio> And you can implement shift/reset with the others, as well. But that's more believable.
01:42:29 <mmorrow> well, it's true that the functions in MonadDelimitedCont can implem all or the above
01:42:36 <vegai> having returns inside my if statements will surely confuse somebody
01:42:45 <vegai> oh well, perhaps they'll learn then
01:42:46 <mmorrow> can these base functions be supported by a Cont(T) variant ?
01:42:50 <mmorrow> (a single ...)
01:43:09 <dolio> Well, if you have the control0 one it's not hard to implement the rest.
01:43:19 <mmorrow> oh nice
01:43:37 <mmorrow> Cont r a = (a -> Maybe (Cont r r) -> [Cont r r] -> r)
01:43:59 <mmorrow> hmm
01:44:00 <dolio> Since 'shift f = control0 (\k -> reset (f (\a -> reset (k a)))' I believe.
01:44:01 <dolio> And so on.
01:44:41 <dolio> cc-delcont has primitives similar to control0, and implements them all that way.
01:44:42 <mmorrow> oh, that's really interesting actually, because glguy did a shift with monadLib that's:
01:44:55 <mmorrow> shift f = suspend $ \ k -> f $ reset . k
01:45:01 <mmorrow> (well, he first did)
01:45:12 <mmorrow> shift f = suspend $ \ k -> reset $ f $ \ a -> reset $ k a
01:45:25 <mmorrow> does that mean that suspend is control0-ish?
01:45:33 <mmorrow> suspend f = callCC $ \ k -> f k >>= abort
01:45:44 <mmorrow> (abort is some function in monadLib)
01:46:00 <dolio> Perhaps.
01:46:03 <mmorrow> hmm
01:46:31 <mmorrow> but does this say anything about the multiple-prompts ability?
01:47:05 <dolio> Well, shift doesn't take a prompt, so there must be only one.
01:47:14 <mmorrow> yeah, true
01:47:31 <dolio> I'm not sure how much use those are in practice.
01:47:40 <dolio> Oleg uses them in his dynamically scoped variables thing.
01:48:44 <mmorrow> i hacked a multiple prompts "thing" in http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=671
01:48:51 <mmorrow> where that idea i got from:
01:48:59 <mmorrow> http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dherman/research/papers/icfp07-great-escape.pdf
01:49:04 <mmorrow> "The great escape"
01:49:10 <dormoose> Is there an easy way to replace a substring with another substring in a string?
01:49:30 <mmorrow> (with "hacked" being the key word there unfortunately)
01:50:23 <mmorrow> `test2' i found extremely amusing
01:50:39 <mmorrow> dormoose: how are you doing it now?
01:51:11 <blackh> dormoose: There's no function that "just does it" but it's quite a good exercise to write yourself one.
01:51:19 <dormoose> mmorrow: not at all
01:51:39 <mmorrow> the part i'd worry about is the algo you use to /find/ the target substring
01:51:47 <dolio> mmorrow: That's some evil stuff. :)
01:51:59 <mmorrow> dolio: woot! :)
01:52:02 <blackh> dormoose: Are you searching for a string and replacing that?
01:52:08 <dormoose> mmorrow, blackh: Actually, I can just filter the crap out of it.
01:52:24 <dormoose> blackh: no, I just wanted to get rid of Windwoes-style linebreaks
01:52:32 <mmorrow> oh yeah, that's easy
01:52:33 <dormoose> the lines function doesn't remove those.
01:52:39 <mmorrow> filter (/='\r')
01:52:44 <dormoose> *nod*
01:53:44 <dormoose> \o/
02:01:39 <mmorrow> dolio: (i meant to link you to glguy's paste for whatever http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=983)
02:02:23 <mmorrow> this one's interesting too http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=982
02:09:28 <dormoose> Hm. How to make a [String] into [[String]], split the string-bunch into sub-bunch separated on paragraph breaks? groupBy!
02:09:36 <dormoose>         paragraphs strs = groupBy (\x y -> not $ null y) strs
02:11:02 <yitz> dormoose: that is not a good idea
02:11:24 <quicksilver> groupBy is designed to work on equivalence relations
02:11:27 <quicksilver> it's not what you want.
02:12:12 <yitz> dormoose: the problem is that groupBy does not necessarily always compare adjacent list elements.
02:12:56 <dormoose> yitz: ohhh. Suggest a better way then?
02:13:13 <dormoose> quicksilver: Well, I supposed it only compares adjacent elements, so that hack would work
02:13:13 <yitz> dormoose: I think you actually want to break [[String]] into [[[String]]]?
02:13:45 <yitz> (list of lines into paragraphs?)
02:14:03 <dormoose> yitz: No, why? That's [String] -> [[String]] all right
02:14:07 <dormoose> list of lines into a list of paragraphs
02:14:10 <yitz> otherwise null y doesn't make sense
02:14:22 <yitz> oh, i see
02:14:32 <icqn> How to read this code http://codepad.org/rwbZBfaL ? Is it so that foldr takes step as function and id, xs as two parameters, so then steps awaits for the third parameter z, after foldr has done the job?
02:15:01 <yitz> dormoose: so the you are interested in the function break
02:15:04 <yitz> @type break
02:15:05 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> ([a], [a])
02:15:45 <yitz> > break null ["abc", "def", "", "ghi", "","jkl"]
02:15:46 <lambdabot>   (["abc","def"],["","ghi","","jkl"])
02:16:01 <dormoose> yitz: There are lots of paragraphs there.
02:16:14 <yitz> yes, so you'll need to use break repeatedly
02:16:21 <dormoose> *nod* Recursion, here I come
02:16:34 <dolio> mmorrow: suspend doesn't really behave like any of the delimited control operators.
02:17:37 <icqn> @src break
02:17:37 <lambdabot> break p =  span (not . p)
02:18:48 <dolio> mmorrow: For instance: suspend (\k -> k 1 >> k 2) never gets to the k 2.
02:20:24 <yitz> > let paragraphs = map (takeWhile (not . null)) . takeWhile (not . null) . iterate (drop 1 . dropWhile (not . null)) in paragraphs ["abc", "def", "", "ghi", "","jkl"] -- dormoose, another approach
02:20:25 <lambdabot>   [["abc","def"],["ghi"],["jkl"]]
02:20:44 <yitz> not necessarily nicer, but a points-free one-liner
02:20:52 <Peaker> woohoo, my widget set is getting cool!  Boxes, Grids, Text Edits, Labels, reflection of available keyboard bindings :-)
02:21:29 <dormoose> yitz: points-free? I see lots o' points there
02:21:39 * yitz continues to abuse the map . takeWhile . iterate idiom
02:22:22 <Peaker> dormoose: dots are supposed to be circles (mathematical composition), not points :-)     points refer to named argument values of functions
02:22:41 <yitz> dormoose: points free style means no variables, only the functions
02:23:25 <yitz> @pl \x y z -> x + y * z
02:23:26 <lambdabot> (. (*)) . (.) . (+)
02:23:50 <yitz> @help pl
02:23:50 <lambdabot> pointless <expr>. Play with pointfree code.
02:23:56 <sereven> @unpl  map (takeWhile (not . null)) . takeWhile (not . null) . iterate (drop 1 . dropWhile (not . null))
02:23:57 <lambdabot> (\ c -> map (takeWhile (\ f -> not (null f))) (takeWhile (\ l -> not (null l)) (iterate (\ o -> drop 1 (dropWhile (\ r -> not (null r)) o)) c)))
02:24:12 <mmorrow> dolio: ah yeah, i guess it's really just some callCC variant
02:24:39 <dolio> Well, not exactly.
02:24:53 <dolio> It's actually the C operator.
02:25:07 <dolio> Which ddarius will tell you is better than callCC.
02:25:31 <yitz> Peaker: is this widget set destined to be mapped to various backends via Reactive?
02:25:33 <dolio> But it doesn't have a type that's right for a typeclass like MonadCont or whatever.
02:25:57 <dormoose> Peaker: Didn't know that, thanks (=
02:25:59 <Peaker> yitz: well, the widget set currently has SDL as a backend but I plan to support GLUT as well
02:26:05 <dormoose> yitz: fun.
02:26:32 <Peaker> yitz: Reactive is currently not ready for use so I decided to go ahead and make an imperative widget set -- but soon enough I discovered how to make it almost completely functional without reactive's help :)
02:26:33 <dolio> @type let abort e = Cont (\_ -> e) in \f -> callCC (\k -> f k >>= abort)
02:26:35 <lambdabot> forall a b a1. ((a -> Cont a1 b) -> Cont a1 a1) -> Cont a1 a
02:26:55 <yitz> dormoose: yep. yet another approach is using unfoldr, I'll let you work that one out.
02:27:06 <dolio> @type \f -> Cont (\k -> runCont (f k) id)
02:27:07 <lambdabot> forall a a1. ((a -> a1) -> Cont a1 a1) -> Cont a1 a
02:27:19 <Peaker> yitz: I am very pleased with how purely functional it is :-)  Though its still in very early design/development, I'm not sure how usable it actually is
02:27:38 <icqn> How to read this code http://codepad.org/rwbZBfaL ? Is it so that foldr takes step as function and id, xs as two parameters, so then steps awaits for the third parameter z, after foldr has done the job?
02:27:43 <yitz> Peaker: oh, these are non-Reactive?
02:27:57 <Peaker> yitz: right, but I intend to hook it to reactive when its ready
02:28:00 <Peaker> (When reactive is ready)
02:28:17 <quicksilver> a widget set, on its own basis, is not going to be reactive.
02:28:32 <Peaker> This is the core/basis of my widget set: http://haskell.pastebin.com/d1d135aeb
02:28:38 <quicksilver> a widget set is a bunch of input handlers + rendering handlers
02:28:48 <quicksilver> you'd hope it would be attachable to reactive and similar things of course.
02:28:57 <Peaker> yeah, my input handlers just generate a new widget state for the widget
02:29:05 <dolio> @type \f -> Cont (\k -> runCont (f (\a -> Cont (\_ -> k a))) id)
02:29:06 <lambdabot> forall a a1 a2. ((a -> Cont a2 a1) -> Cont a2 a2) -> Cont a2 a
02:29:12 <Peaker> and the rendering handlers generate a monadic value of a Draw monad - so they can only draw stuff
02:29:22 <alar> what's up with hpaste.org ?
02:29:40 <Peaker> I wanted a Draw Monoid at first - but I needed to get the text size of font stuff so I can put the cursor in text edits :-)
02:30:05 <quicksilver> yes, that's a typical reason you need Monad instead of Monoid
02:30:08 <quicksilver> text extents
02:30:17 <quicksilver> but more generally 'measuring stuff' so you can do layouts.
02:30:20 <Peaker> quicksilver: Did anyone else write a widget set of similar design?
02:30:33 <quicksilver> well it seems likely but I don't know one off-hand.
02:30:40 <quicksilver> I recognise some of the subproblems you're facing :)
02:30:44 <Peaker> I am really really pleased with this, in just a few days I have got so much functionality working. Haskell is awesome :)
02:30:50 <quicksilver> I've faced them in related but less general contexts.
02:31:57 * itewsh is away: aw !
02:32:06 <Peaker> If you want to check it out -- git clone git://github.com/Peaker/lui.git    (it depends on SDL, SDL-ttf, I plan to separate the backend to abstract GLUT/SDL away)
02:32:25 <Peaker> now adding a widget to show the reflection of available key bindings
02:32:47 <icqn> alar, down for many days already
02:32:50 <yitz> icqn: it's usually less helpful to think of things in terms of "waiting around for", then doing, etc. Rather, think of building up values using functions.
02:33:18 <dolio> mmorrow: Anyhow, C/suspend aborts the rest of the computation (like delimited operators and unlike callCC), but the captured continuations still 'never return' (like callCC, but unlike delimited operators).
02:33:21 <alar> icqn: does anybody know why?
02:33:37 <quicksilver> only shapr
02:33:39 <Peaker> yitz: My widget set is going to kick gtk, wx, etc's ass :-)
02:33:41 <quicksilver> who has not been seen for a bit ;)
02:33:45 <quicksilver> preflex: seen shapr
02:33:46 <preflex>  shapr was last seen on #haskell-blah 11 hours, 20 minutes and 21 seconds ago, saying: @quote
02:33:51 <icqn> alar, I have no idea, i use codepad.org instead
02:33:57 <quicksilver> @where hpaste2
02:33:57 <lambdabot> http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/new
02:34:08 <yitz> Peaker: sounds ambitious :)
02:34:10 <icqn> yitz, Ok, but how does this works step by step?
02:34:21 <Peaker> yitz: Only if you consider wx, gtk, etc anything more than a disgrace :-)
02:34:50 <alar> I use paste.org.ru =)
02:34:59 <yitz> Peaker: they are a disgrace that was built with many man-years of work. they must have done *something*
02:35:01 <icqn> yitz, Was the fists part of what i have said correct?
02:35:21 <Peaker> yitz: Specifically, I really care about good keyboard control, and none of the existing GUI's have even remotely decent keyboard control
02:35:33 <Peaker> yitz: emacs is pretty good, but its not exactly a GUI toolkit
02:35:37 <quicksilver> Peaker: if you consider them merely a disgrace, you are being fairly unfair to the authors of those systems.
02:35:50 <dormoose> Peaker: Windwoes has pretty universal keyboard mappings for UI widgets, that's about the only good thing about it.
02:35:52 <quicksilver> Peaker: they are large, complex, and imperfect, certainly.
02:35:57 <Peaker> quicksilver: I think they're all doing a fine job of immitating the poor model that came from Apple/Microsoft
02:36:11 <yitz> Peaker: emacs is everything, even the kitchen sink (remember their old icon?)
02:36:17 <dolio> mmorrow: That definition of shift being like the one with control0 may just be due to the fact that all Cont(T) continuations are in some sense delimited (by runCont(T)).
02:36:41 <loadquo> Peaker: Is your widget a typeclass so people can define their own widgets?
02:36:46 <dolio> So 'reset' can affect even 'abortive' continuations.
02:36:54 <Peaker> loadquo: yeah
02:37:06 <Peaker> loadquo: its very early, but this is how my class looks like now: http://haskell.pastebin.com/d1d135aeb
02:37:16 <Peaker> (no mouse support, etc)
02:38:17 <yitz> icqn: hmm. well, step, id, and xs are all parameters of foldr. the result is a function, which is then applied to z.
02:38:35 <Peaker> quicksilver: I guess my general opinion of almost the entire software world (excluding Haskell and some other beacons of light :-) is that its all horrible, and full of incompetents :)
02:38:42 <hugo___> hi
02:39:04 <hugo___> how do i implement an efficient random number generator, that only produces unique numbers in a given range ?
02:39:10 <loadquo> Peaker: Interesting. Is it worth building for the future and thinking about multi-touch?
02:39:32 <hugo___> i can think of two or three solutions for this, but none of them are efficient :(
02:39:43 <Peaker> loadquo: sure. I'm currently focusing on getting enough of a widget set ready so I can write a Haskell editor that edits Haskell AST's directly, without any text anywhere :)
02:39:55 <yitz> Peaker: Haskell's beauty sometimes causes us to feel that way. But in reality, "horrible" and "incompetents" is a bit of an exaggeration.
02:40:40 <Peaker> yitz: its all relative of course... My expectations are very high, and that leads to great disappointments, heh
02:41:05 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: level-monad 0.2.1
02:41:10 <yitz> icqn: in fact, you could even think of *all four* of them as parameters to foldr, as follows:
02:41:14 <yitz> @type foldr
02:41:15 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
02:41:16 <augustss> hugo___: only unique numbers?  do you mean the RNG cannot repeat?
02:41:54 <Peaker> yitz: for example, none of the major OS properly handle memory thrashing.. Just today I had to reboot at my friend's computer about 10 times because of memory thrashing -- each time I tried blocking it some other way to no avail (turning swap off, ulimits, and others).  This I find ridiculous
02:42:03 <yitz> icqn: you can take b to be any type. Including a function type c -> d
02:43:04 <augustss> Peaker: There's not been a major OS that can handle low memory conditions for years and years.  It used to be different when memory was scarce.
02:43:13 <Peaker> hugo___: you can raise to the power of some X and do modulu your range, just have to choose the X to some criterion and it will complete a full circle (touch all numbers) before returning to your number again. I think your X and N just have to have a GCD=1
02:43:25 <yitz> icqn: so if you specify that for b, you get foldr :: (a -> (c -> d) -> c -> d) -> (c -> d) -> [a] -> c -> d
02:43:40 <yitz> icqn: so in that case, foldr has 4 parameters.
02:43:40 <icqn> i have just strated to learn haskell, and this currying is really new to me, and the dwfinition like this are really easy to read, map (dropwhile IsSpace)
02:43:54 <Peaker> augustss: the problem is not just low memory though, its memory thrashing.  If I accidentally run a Haskell program that does: "let x = [0..] ; sum x" -- I lose all UI responsiveness, and that's not an inherent problem
02:44:28 <yitz> augustss: is PalmOS years and years?
02:44:32 <Peaker> augustss: At my friend, I tried compiling cabal-install, and the linker took a lot of memory. He has 1GB of ram, but it still thrashed and made computer unresponsive for many minutes before we decided to hard-reboot
02:44:48 <augustss> yitz: I don't count it as a major OS
02:44:51 <icqn> yitz, that is clear
02:44:55 <dormoose> Peaker: What is memory trashing?
02:45:17 <yitz> augustss: ok, got it. :)
02:45:55 <Peaker> dormoose: http://tinyurl.com/cp2m3o
02:46:31 <dormoose> Peaker: slam dance: dance the slam dance
02:46:47 <Peaker> quicksilver: I think I have a unique idea of how to handle keyboard focus, that is simpler and possibly nicer than other toolkits
02:46:55 <dormoose> Peaker: Also, thanks, found it
02:47:13 <yitz> augustss: anyway, PalmOS doens't really handle low memory condition well. It just is so primitive that the OS itself fits in almost no memory.
02:48:02 <loadquo> Peaker: Isn't that partly due to the OS trying to fool each program that it has infinite memory using virtual memory?
02:48:41 <Peaker> loadquo: I have a simple solution that I'm pretty sure would mitigate the memory thrashing problems, even while emulating "infinite" virtual memory
02:50:15 <Peaker> loadquo: Just assign each process a set of "credits" -- have the page aging mechanism move a process's "credits" from its LRU pages to its MRU pages -- have these "credits" spread over the entire MRU working set. When swapping out/throwing a page, choose the one whose credit sum (from all processes) is the lowest.  A thrashing process will spread its credits thin, and will not cause the UI which has few pages and many credits to be swapped out
02:50:54 <Peaker> so pages will be swapped out based on their relative utility -- rather than just based on LRUness
02:51:33 <icqn> @foldl
02:51:39 <Peaker> Making the aging localized to processes rather than global and this credit management may have a small performance hit, but I'm pretty sure its worth it
02:51:40 <icqn> @src foldl
02:51:40 <lambdabot> foldl f z []     = z
02:51:41 <lambdabot> foldl f z (x:xs) = foldl f (f z x) xs
02:51:49 <luqui> Peaker, that's a pretty solution.
02:52:01 <Peaker> luqui: thanks :)
02:52:48 <yitz> Peaker: sounds nice. run it past people who have spent their entire life living and breathing kernel scheduling algorithms (there are people like that) and see what they say.
02:52:59 <Peaker> luqui: currently, our OS's will swap out the only 50 pages that allow "login/bash" to run, just so that a process that has 1000000 pages will have 1000050 pages instead
02:53:26 <Peaker> yitz: I'll try
02:54:24 <loadquo> Peaker: Interesting idea, I can see cases where you might not want that kind of system. E.g.  working with large videos would get bogged down by some of your browsers cache. But in most cases it seems useful.
02:54:44 <Peaker> loadquo: just assign less credits to the web browser and more to the video editor then :-)
02:55:27 <luqui> does anybody know the name of the monad transformer library with modular lifts?
02:55:37 <Peaker> luqui: what are modular lifts?
02:55:41 <yitz> icqn: see http://foldl.com and http://foldr.com
02:55:52 <Peaker> luqui: lift . lift . lift  seems pretty modular? :-)
02:56:40 <bastl> i have installed hscolour and use it as a module, but i dont find the binary hscolour. any hints ?
02:57:02 <luqui> somebody found a solution to not requiring instances like MonadState s m => MonadState s (ReaderT r m)
02:57:13 <luqui> the quadratic blowup in such instances
02:57:21 <icqn> yitz, lol, really useless pages....
02:57:34 <malcolmw> bastl: it might be named HsColour instead
02:57:34 <lambdabot> malcolmw: You have 3 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.
02:57:38 <blackh> bastl: It ends up in ~/.cabal/bin/ - not sure if 'hscolour' package is enough
02:57:39 <loadquo> Peaker: Who has the ability to assign credits? Is it something that process can do to itself? Or would you expect users to take a hand?
02:57:46 <yitz> Peaker: yeah, it's probably not so simple when you need real-time scheduling characteristics. which is becoming more and more prevalent even for everyday use.
02:57:51 <luqui> Peaker, here's the page describing it:  http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/fplunch/weblog/?p=111
02:57:54 <Peaker> loadquo: I guess it should be a ulimit-like mechanism
02:57:57 <blackh> Yes - it's HsColour
02:58:39 <luqui> ah there it is: mmtl
02:59:09 <bastl> malcolmw and blackh: cool. you're both right :-)
03:00:28 <Peaker> luqui: oh, cool - I think that the N^2 thing is just the wrong approach and that you can just newtype your transformer and writer named lifters for the various monads inside it, and then your code looks like:  do { liftIO $ ... ; liftSomeDataReader ask ; liftWhatever operationOnWhatever }
03:00:40 <yitz> malcolmw: saw your codec blog post. cool idea.
03:01:11 <luqui> Peaker, so pushing the complexity to when you define the stack
03:01:19 <luqui> Peaker, but the FP Lunch thing is better than both :-)
03:01:48 <luqui> if you can figure out how to implement tmap, with its scary type
03:01:51 <malcolmw> yitz: yeah, I'm wondering if a combination of bytestring, binary, and ndp might help with the performance aspects
03:01:57 <luqui> tmap :: (Monad m, Monad n) => (forall a. m a -> n a) -> (forall b. n b -> m b) -> t m c -> t n c
03:02:55 <Peaker> luqui: you push some boilerplate to the definition of the stack, not complexity :)
03:03:12 <luqui> Peaker, okay, fine, boilerplate.
03:03:18 <luqui> "code I don't want to write" either way :-)
03:03:29 <Peaker> luqui: and that boilerplate really isn't that bad, IMO...  see the monad transformers here: http://github.com/Peaker/lui/blob/1cec0cab725cb9159200f78d01d49b09b0a1f970/Draw.hs
03:04:12 <Peaker> luqui: I agree it would be nicer not to write it, but not if it entails extra complexity.. Its just 2 lines of boilerplate per transformer in the declaration :)
03:04:15 <luqui> yeah, and it's in line with the "death-to-type-dwimmery" philosophy I have
03:04:25 <BONUS> @pl \x -> f ($ x)
03:04:25 <lambdabot> f . flip id
03:04:30 <mmorrow> dolio: ah, i see.
03:04:33 <yitz> malcolmw: ndp?
03:04:33 <bastl> can hscoulour do line numbering ?
03:04:40 <mmorrow> malcolmw: hi.
03:05:02 <hugo___1> im sorry
03:05:06 <hugo___1> this got disconnected
03:05:08 <hugo___1> :(
03:05:31 <mmorrow> malcolmw: i'd love to see his code for the register machine/bytecode
03:05:37 <malcolmw> yitz: nested data parallelism
03:05:43 <hugo___1> anyone can give me some pointers about coding a unique random number generator ? im planning on using Data.Map, but i guess it would be very innefficient :(
03:06:02 <lilac> does anyone know if there are any bookstores in Cambridge (UK) carrying RWH?
03:06:12 <yitz> malcolmw: ah, yes. I was also thinking stream fusion might be helpful in certain cases.
03:06:13 <blackh> hugo__1: Use Data.Map. It isn't inefficient.
03:06:27 <malcolmw> mmorrow: do you want his report describing it all?
03:06:48 <mmorrow> malcolmw: that would be excellent :)
03:07:11 <hugo___> blackh: i would have to do a delete for each generated random number ... for a range of dimension N, it would run in O(N log (N) )
03:07:12 <blackh> hugo__1: Another way is to generate a list of numbers in order, then scramble them.
03:07:38 <hugo___> blackh: yes, i did thought of that, but i guess the scrambling function would always generate some kind of pattern
03:08:06 <loadquo> <Peaker> hugo___: you can raise to the power of some X and do modulu your range, just have to choose the X to some criterion and it will complete a full circle (touch all numbers) before returning to your number again. I think your X and N just have to have a GCD=1
03:08:19 <blackh> hugo__: Put the numbers into an array, then iterate over it, swapping each one with one at a random index.
03:08:36 <hugo___> blackh: that is quite the C approach
03:08:51 <blackh> hugo__: I am not an old hand at functional programming by any means, but it seems to me that a mutable array would be well justified in this case.
03:09:11 <yitz> loadquo Peaker hugo___ No, you want to make sure that N is a generator mod X, otherwise the period will be smaller
03:09:11 <Peaker> > iterate ((`mod` 20).(*7)) 1
03:09:13 <lambdabot>   [1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,...
03:09:24 <Peaker> oops, yeah :-)
03:09:41 <blackh> hugo__: This is true, but it is very efficient and I can't see that it would be wrong in FP, since it is contained in a small area of your program. Am I wrong about this?
03:10:02 <hugo___> blackh: you are correct
03:10:10 <hugo___> but arrays are immutable
03:10:21 <hugo___> in haskell
03:10:23 <blackh> hugo__: Mutable arrays aren't immutable!
03:10:28 <hugo___> oh
03:10:39 <hugo___> i wasn't planning on touching those in my lifetime
03:10:47 <blackh> hugo__: Also since you're using a random number generator, your code has to be at least a little bit monadic anyway.
03:11:14 <blackh> hugo__: I have a better idea:
03:11:18 <loadquo> > iterate ((`mod` 21).(*7)) [1..50]
03:11:19 <lambdabot>       No instance for (Integral [t])
03:11:19 <lambdabot>        arising from a use of `mod' at <i...
03:11:19 <yitz> blackh: you are forcing hugo___ 's code into the ST monad.
03:11:27 <hugo___> yes, im trying to build out a noise lib, im basing myself on the perlin book
03:11:32 <blackh> hugo__: Same algorithm, but use an IntMap
03:12:04 <ivanm> Axman6: looks like RWH is even cheaper now! :o http://www.fishpond.com.au/product_info.php?ref=261&products_id=13048475&affiliate_banner_id=1
03:12:09 <hugo___> so, delete the numbers as they are generated, but instead of using the Data.Map, im using the IntMap
03:12:11 <Peaker> > iterate ((`mod` 21).(*7)) 1
03:12:13 <lambdabot>   [1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,...
03:12:13 <yitz> hugo___: ah, so it probably does need to be extremely fast then.
03:12:18 <blackh> hugo__: O(log N) per random number
03:12:42 <hugo___> yitz: yes, i will try a glsl approach after im finished with the cpu
03:12:44 <blackh> hugo__: My thought was that you use an IntMap as if it were an array.
03:13:06 <hugo___> yes, O(log N) is what i get in Data.Map
03:13:38 <yitz> hugo___: how large of a period do you need?
03:13:47 <hugo___> small
03:13:53 <hugo___> 512 max
03:14:05 <hugo___> because then i will just interpolate through those values
03:14:42 <yitz> hugo___: so then how about an immutable array that you just cycle over? maybe with some additional fast operation (one machine op or so) that increases the period?
03:15:35 <yitz> hugo___: like keep 2 simultaneous iterations going with relatively prime periods, and xor them together?
03:16:28 <yitz> hugo___: or Peaker's idea. divisions are actually fast on today's cpus.
03:16:43 <Peaker> yitz: my idea was inaccurate, but I'm sure its something similar :)
03:16:50 <hugo___> hmm, seems good, i dont see how can i increase the period "efficiently" with that approach
03:16:55 <hugo___> is mod actually a mod ?
03:17:01 <hugo___> or is it just the remainder ?
03:17:14 <dobblego> mod is modulus, rem is remainder
03:17:16 <yitz> Peaker: it's the most famous RNG, well known at least since Knuth's first volume came out.
03:17:21 <hugo___> ah ok
03:17:37 <loadquo> > 7 `mod` 20
03:17:38 <lambdabot>   7
03:17:58 <yitz> > 7 `mod` (-20)
03:17:59 <lambdabot>   -13
03:18:04 <yitz> > 7 `rem` (-20)
03:18:06 <lambdabot>   7
03:18:07 <Peaker> quotRem and divMod are analogous to each other except for the way negative results are handled
03:18:37 <hugo___> > (-7) `mod` 20
03:18:39 <lambdabot>   13
03:18:53 <hugo___> ok
03:20:44 <hugo___> i ill use the Data.Map approach, and dump the numbers in a immutable array, the dimension must be supplied in a initialization function
03:21:16 <yitz> hugo___: i think the standard formula is n -> (a * n + b) `mod` p where p is prime, a is a generator modulo p, and b is near sqrt p.
03:22:01 <hugo___> ok
03:24:36 <drdozer> I've just made some picklers using hxt
03:24:58 <drdozer> when I run them, it doesn't build anything useful but it also doesn't print out any warnings or errors about the xml
03:25:25 <drdozer> any ideas?
03:27:59 <blackh> drdozer: Lots.
03:28:27 <blackh> drdozer: Is it the unpickler or the pickler that isn't working right?
03:28:31 <yitz> @type trace
03:28:32 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `trace'
03:28:43 <drdozer> blackh, unpickler I assume - xml->data
03:28:55 <yitz> @hoogle trace
03:28:55 <lambdabot> Debug.Trace trace :: String -> a -> a
03:28:55 <lambdabot> module Debug.Trace
03:28:55 <lambdabot> package traced
03:29:19 <blackh> drdozer: The unpickler can fail for many reasons. Is the input generated by a pickler?
03:29:36 <drdozer> blackh, no - it's xml generated by a 3rd party java app
03:29:48 <drdozer> blackh, so my pickle code is almost certainly 'wrong'
03:30:07 <blackh> drdozer: In that case, there are several things to check for.
03:30:13 <yitz> drdozer: trace (putStr "hoot!") foo will print "hoot!" before computing foo
03:30:29 <blackh> drdozer: Are you using xpText? If so, are any of the strings zero length?
03:31:00 <drdozer> blackh, I wouldn't know - the xml file is several megs in length
03:31:12 <blackh> drdozer: If they can be zero length, then use xpText0
03:31:29 <blackh> drdozer: This behaviour is documented in the API docs, but it's hard to find.
03:31:44 <drdozer> blackh, what I really need from xunpickleDocument is some logging of what it tried and where it failed and what input it ignored
03:31:45 <blackh> drdozer: If xpText sees zero-length input, it doesn't give "" - it fails
03:32:27 <blackh> drdozer: Well, that doesn't exist in HXT. However, you may be interested to know that I have written an almost source-code-compatible HXT pickler library based on hexpat, which is much faster than HXT
03:32:43 <blackh> drdozer: My library tells you exactly what failed.
03:32:52 <drdozer> blackh: that sounds like you've just made a sale

03:35:20 <blackh> http://blacksapphire.com/~blackh/haskell/
03:35:37 <blackh> The only thing is, it depends on some bug fixes in hexpat, which are contained in the patch files you see there.
03:35:52 <blackh> I have submitted these to the author of hexpat, and he's considering them as we speak.
03:36:23 <blackh> drdozer: This code is well tested, because I am using it in my project.

03:36:41 <lambdabot>   thread killed
03:37:15 <blackh> drdozer: The "almost" part of the source code compatibility is that the XmlPickler type takes an extra argument.

03:38:22 <blackh> drdozer: If your pickler works on an element, you have to say XmlPickler Node <yourType> ... the 'Node' is extra
03:39:03 <blackh> drdozer: The behaviour of this code is - as far as I have been able to determine - *exactly* the same as HXT
03:39:03 <drdozer> right, I've got hexpat 0.2 installed with cabal

03:39:30 <blackh> drdozer: You'll need to download hexpat 0.2 and apply the patches, then do 'cabal install'
03:39:38 <drdozer> blackh, do I use darcs to grab taht code from blacksapphire?
03:39:55 <blackh> drdozer: No - I just stuck it on there - you'll have to download it with your browser
03:40:48 <blackh> drdozer: I will release this on Hackage soon - I am just waiting for Evan Martin to consider my patches.
03:41:06 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: stream-monad 0.1
03:42:15 <blackh> drdozer: I don't have a test case handy, but it's a pretty simple API - no arrows.
03:44:13 <blackh> drdozer: The second argument of XmlPickler is one of the types out of the Text.XML.Expat.Tree structure.  It can be [(String,String)] if your pickler works on attributes.
03:45:05 <poliquin> Newbie function type problem .. Seems like I should get an error .. any help appreciated ..
03:45:07 <poliquin> http://paste.lisp.org/display/74343
03:45:17 <blackh> drdozer: There is one slight difference in behaviour that I recall.  My picklers are less fussy than HXT with regard to the order of tags.
03:46:28 <blackh> drdozer: For example, if you do xpPair (xpElem "a" ..) (xpElem "b" ..) and the order of tags is reversed... then my pickler will succeed but HXT will fail.
03:49:55 <pozic> Why do we have 'let' for functions, but not for type definitions?
03:52:02 <quicksilver> pozic: are you talking about haskell or lambdabot?
03:52:49 <yitz> pozic: or ghci?
03:53:17 <yitz> pozic: I think we should have them for all 3
03:53:19 * yitz ducks
03:53:41 <lilac> pozic: you want something like "f :: let X = Either [String] (Maybe (Tree Int)) in X -> X"?
03:54:33 <lilac> if so, there's "type X = Either [String] (Maybe (Tree Int)); f :: X -> X"
03:55:00 <yitz> let X = Either [String] (Maybe (Tree Int)); f :: X -> X; y = f z in y
03:55:46 <yitz> lilac: type X is global
03:56:02 <lilac> is that a problem in practice?
03:56:14 <yitz> lilac: yes.
03:56:44 <lilac> yitz: got an example?
03:57:09 <yitz> lilac: allowing local type declarations leads to certain confusion, but I think it's worth it.
03:57:27 <lilac> fwiw, i think conal uses this technique to good effect here: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/reactive/0.10.5/doc/html/FRP-Reactive-LegacyAdapters.html
03:58:40 <yitz> lilac: the most important application is at the ghci prompt, of course.
03:59:01 <lilac> i'd love to be able to enter 'data', 'newtype' and 'instance' at the ghci prompt
03:59:29 <lilac> but i hardly ever use type annotations there, so i don't think i'd benefit often from type synonyms
03:59:55 <yitz> lilac: in general, you'd want to use it for the same reason you sometimes define variables in a let or where even when syntactically they could have been made global.
04:00:02 <dormoose> I miss being able to print debugging info to standard output )=
04:00:13 <lilac> @index trace
04:00:13 <lambdabot> Debug.Trace

04:00:59 <dormoose> yitz: Is this for me?
04:01:07 <lilac> dormoose: yep.
04:01:25 <yitz> dormoose: trace (putStr "hoot!") foo will print "hoot!" before computing foo
04:01:39 <lilac> rather, trace "hoot!" foo
04:01:52 <dormoose> Cool! Thanks!
04:01:58 <yitz> dormoose: this is unsafe, don't use it in real life, but it's great for debugging
04:02:26 <yitz> oh, oops, yeah
04:02:34 <dormoose> yitz: Well, s'pose so, yes
04:03:25 * yitz wonders why quicksilver didn't through anything at him
04:03:29 <yitz> *throw
04:04:43 <lilac> yitz: i guess because 'trace' is a case where you /want/ to violate haskell's abstraction
04:05:15 <yitz> lilac: i meant because of my advocating local type declarations
04:05:36 <yitz> lilac: i'm guessing that quicksilver is opposed
04:07:09 <pozic> quicksilver: Haskell and I was mostly referring to the problem with repeating the same type-expression.
04:07:54 <pozic> lilac: you completely specified a type, but now imagine that all your concrete leaf types are parameters.
04:08:38 <quicksilver> pozic: *nod*
04:09:07 <quicksilver> pozic: as our usage of types gets more sophisticated, we hit boilerplate problems like this more often. What I tend to do is this:
04:09:34 <quicksilver> suppose I want to write "let X = ...long type... in data Y = ... very long type mentioning X several times ..."
04:09:43 <quicksilver> instead I make Y parametric
04:09:56 <quicksilver> data Y x = .... long type with 'x' where I would have had 'X'
04:10:13 <quicksilver> then you can instantiate as "Y X" or "Y (...defin of X...)"
04:10:17 <pozic> quicksilver: yes, I also sometimes do that.
04:10:28 <quicksilver> it's not ideal but it has solved, in practice, the cases I've hit.
04:11:05 <augustss> quicksilver: types need more equal rights!
04:11:22 <gio123> @seen Cale
04:11:22 <lambdabot> Cale is in #haskell, #haskell-overflow and #ghc. I don't know when Cale last spoke.
04:11:22 <quicksilver> quite.
04:11:33 <quicksilver> no type inference without type representation.
04:12:21 <gio123> @seen ski_
04:12:21 <lambdabot> ski_ is in ##logic and #haskell. I don't know when ski_ last spoke.
04:14:23 <quicksilver> pozic: as a consequence I have learnt it is actually quite often a good idea to make types like that parametric anyway.
04:14:34 <quicksilver> more often than you realise, it's useful to write functions which are parametric in 'x'
04:14:45 <quicksilver> and there are often reasons to instantiate differently.
04:15:42 <quicksilver> shapr: people are asking what has happened to hpaste.
04:15:54 <quicksilver> shapr: mind you, other people are happily using mmorrow's hpaste2.
04:17:55 <shapr> quicksilver: I killed hpaste1, and haven't gotten around to fixing it.
04:18:06 <shapr> I hope people use hpaste2 more
04:18:28 <loadquo> @where paste2

04:19:56 <lambdabot> http://moonpatio.com
04:20:16 <mmorrow> @where+ mymind gone
04:20:17 <lambdabot> Done.
04:20:33 <quicksilver> shapr: maybe it would be appropriate to point the hpaste.org domain to an hpaste2 installation, e.g. mmorrows?
04:20:47 <shapr> Yes, that would be best..
04:20:51 <shapr> in my copious spare time...
04:21:11 * quicksilver can entirely emphathise with CST limitations.
04:21:20 <quicksilver> On the other hand, repointing a domain is not typically a long job ;)

04:27:16 <yitz> quicksilver: people still use old hpaste urls. it would be nice if the old hpaste were still alive, but "new" redirected to hpaste2.
04:28:31 <quicksilver> or the old hpaste stuff somehow copied to the new hpaste
04:28:35 <quicksilver> and the old urls made to work.
04:32:07 * mmorrow just fully realized the difficulty of distinguishing ptrs and literals in heap objects/on the stack
04:32:45 <yitz> Peaker: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2009-January/054421.html
04:33:06 <yitz> lambdabot: [Haskell-cafe] Why binding to existing widget toolkits doesn't make any sense
04:33:41 <stuffinq> Is this an appropriate forum for asking about a compiling problem using GHC 6.10.1 on Mac OS X (Leopard)?
04:33:51 <Peaker> yitz: I disagree that the drawing and layout'ing and general look and feel are so trivial- but I agree that their poor implementations in common toolkits are indeed rather trivial to implement. (Something better, like iPhone's interface, is less trivial)
04:34:41 <ivanm> yitz: are you hoping that by telling lambdabot the results it _should_ have returned that she'll start working again?
04:34:59 <stuffinq> I'm getting ld warning: atom sorting error when compiling on OS X
04:35:05 <ivanm> stuffinq: yes, but I don't know how many OSX people are here...
04:35:06 * yitz was trying to cover for lambdabot
04:35:08 <ivanm> maybe #ghc ?
04:35:23 <mmorrow> wow, i get now why "boxing" ints/etc is necessary
04:35:38 <Peaker> mmorrow: why?
04:35:38 <stuffinq> I'll try #ghc... thanks!
04:35:40 <mmorrow> that sucks though
04:35:55 <mmorrow> Peaker: say you have a "Constructor" heap object
04:36:09 <mmorrow> so those have a tag + some args
04:36:30 <mmorrow> the args could be either pointers to other heap objects or (i thought i could do unboxed literals)
04:36:32 <mmorrow> but then
04:36:42 <mmorrow> how do you know what's a ptr and not?
04:36:56 <mmorrow> since they both have the same underlying rep
04:37:10 <yitz> mmorrow: I can't believe a single extra bit is the whole reason
04:37:16 <mmorrow> and if you by accident think a literal int is a ptr and deref it, bye bye
04:37:38 <mmorrow> yitz: i don't want to have tag bits though, since then you can't have a 32-bit int
04:37:51 <Peaker> mmorrow: the static types?
04:37:59 <mmorrow> what?
04:38:16 <mmorrow> (what do you mean?)
04:38:19 <Peaker> mmorrow: why do I need to determine at runtime whether its boxed or not, why isn't it decided in compile time?
04:38:27 <mmorrow> the gc does for instance
04:38:40 <yitz> mmorrow: you can, you just have to do some work. and anyway, on 64 bits that certainly should not be an issue
04:38:43 <Peaker> but the gc has access to all of the information that ghc does (in theory)
04:38:55 <mmorrow> when it's walking over reachable heap objects and following their ptrs
04:38:58 <yitz> mmorrow: this is an old problem faced by every LISP.
04:39:09 <mmorrow> yitz: hmm, interesting
04:39:16 <Peaker> yitz: lisps are dynamically typed, though?
04:39:42 <yitz> Peaker: yes, so you need to be able to tell at runtime whether a node is an atom or a list
04:39:46 <mmorrow> Peaker: the gc has no idea what type a Con closure is
04:40:09 <Peaker> mmorrow: couldn't it have access to the static types? For example, custom gc code can be compiled for every type
04:40:37 <mmorrow> Peaker: sure, for every type of _heap object_, but not every type of haskell type
04:41:27 <mmorrow> yitz: yeah, lisp is easy since it's just atoms or conses
04:41:44 <mmorrow> (and an atom then i guess amounts to a boxed whatever (?))
04:41:44 * Riastradh coughs.
04:42:12 <Riastradh> That is a problem faced by LISP, an archaic language in which the only data types are atoms and conses.  Fortunately nobody uses that archaic language any longer.
04:42:28 <mmorrow> hmm, i've gotta read how the STG machine/ghc handles this
04:42:44 <yitz> Riastradh: now many other people cough
04:46:00 <Riastradh> If you don't quite follow my remarks, I suggest you read something a little more recent than McCarthy 1960, `Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine'.  It may come as a surprise that modern Lisps sport fashionable new data types beyond even atoms and conses.
04:46:03 <yitz> mmorrow: there are two levels - unboxing completely and avoiding the heap altogether, or a lightweight unboxed thing on the heap vs. a full thunk
04:46:34 <koeien> that's lifting & boxing ?
04:46:47 <yitz> koeien: ok
04:47:06 <koeien> as least RWH told me so :)
04:47:09 <koeien> s/as/at
04:47:16 <mmorrow> hmm, yeah i was just thinking maybe have special heap objects for ints/floats
04:47:43 <mmorrow> (and then not have to box them again)
04:47:48 <mmorrow> or something
04:49:02 <yitz> Riastradh: true, but in either it's an analagous problem. I'm suggesting that if you can solve the problem for vintage 1960 LISP, perhaps that is enough to solve it here. Which implies that there must be deeper reasons for boxing Ints.
04:49:37 <mmorrow> Riastradh: sure, but each of these types still considered atoms (at the heap level)?
04:49:50 <mmorrow> *..but aren't each...
04:50:02 <mmorrow> (i don't know if they are or they aren't)
04:50:24 <mmorrow> (i.e. each are in an "atom box")
04:51:06 <mmorrow> data HVal = Cons (Ptr HVal) (Ptr HVal) | forall a. Atom a
04:54:21 <mmorrow> it seems to me like it would make the most sense to implement it that way
04:55:29 <Riastradh> Type and representation are distinct notions.  Nobody particularly cares about the archaic term `atom', and it was never related in any case to the representation of objects, which vary from Lisp system to Lisp system; some are stored in memory and represented by pointers and some are immediate and represent themselves.
04:56:12 <mmorrow> ok, there. how does the gc handle "unboxed" heap objects?
04:56:21 <Riastradh> But in any case, you will find that Lisp hackers often grow bristly when they hear talk of LISP and atoms and conses, similarly to how a Haskell hacker might feel if the state of the art in Haskell were described like Backus's FP.  It makes the speaker sound silly.
04:56:56 <mmorrow> Riastradh: we're talking about implementation at the lowest level.
04:57:55 <yitz> Riastradh: yes, sorry, i didn't mean to raise any hackles. just trying to draw a simplified analogy
04:58:40 <Riastradh> See <http://mumble.net/~campbell/tmp/Scheme.hs> for the foundation of an expression of Scheme's semantics in Haskell.  The type Datum is typically rendered into bits, and a particular layout of memory is assumed so that each type of object that has several locations for subobjects can be represented with a tag and a single location from which the others can be derived.
04:59:23 <mmorrow> ok, so they're boxed/tagged then
04:59:54 <mmorrow> ie, can be thought of as being in an "atom box"
05:00:07 <Riastradh> Try to avoid the word `atom'; it generally serves only to confuse people.
05:00:35 <mmorrow> struct atom { int tag; int size; int data[0] };
05:00:51 <mmorrow> ok, i hear you on that. thanks for the heads up (no sarcasm) :)
05:01:25 <Riastradh> Say `object' and not `atom' if you mean `object'.
05:01:44 <mmorrow> noted
05:01:59 <yitz> Riastradh: what if I mean "object other than list or nil"?
05:02:22 <Riastradh> Then say `object other than a list'.  (Nil is a list.)
05:04:29 <Riastradh> In what context do you want to mean `object other than a list'?
05:04:45 <yitz> Riastradh: atom/list is still a nice super-simplistic way of writing a lisp. I remember doing that in an afternoon once when i was a kid. :)
05:07:43 <mmorrow> from the point of view of a garbage collector, atom/cons is really all that's important (unless atoms can have pointers in them, which i'm not sure of)
05:07:49 <Riastradh> No, mmorrow.
05:07:50 <yitz> Riastradh: I've seen (recent) scheme implementors using "atom" to mean identifier, in the syntactic sense.
05:07:55 <mmorrow> Riastradh: why?
05:08:50 <mmorrow> (i'm talking about a copying collector, not sure if that matters though)
05:09:25 <Riastradh> `Atom' is usually a *type*, the exclusion of conses.
05:09:43 <Riastradh> Example usage:  `A vector is an atom.'
05:09:54 <mmorrow> ah, yes i see.
05:09:58 <Riastradh> Good luck representing a vector not as a pointer in some capacity.
05:10:35 <mmorrow> so them atom /can/ have ptrs in them
05:10:37 <mmorrow> *then
05:10:47 <Riastradh> Say `immediate object' if you mean an object whose representation is self-contained, and `stored object' for an object represented by a pointer to the location where further information, such as subobjects, is stored.
05:11:13 <mmorrow> cool
05:11:14 <Riastradh> Or otherwise use the appropriate terminology for the context you're discussing.  `Atom' is never an appropriate term for representation.
05:11:58 <Riastradh> yitz, those `Scheme implementors' are confused, then, but this is unsurprising.
05:12:06 <mmorrow> heh
05:12:46 <Riastradh> (`Atom' usually includes nil, by the way, so that it is inappropriate even for the concept you asked about earlier, `an object that is neither a cons nor nil'.)
05:12:56 <yitz> Riastradh: indeed
05:18:03 <yitz> mmorrow: anyway, my point was: if a type is unboxed, in the sense that it is not stored in the heap at all, then there is no problem at all. Once it is on the heap, it is just a matter of how you represent heap objects. So I think there must be some other reason why you would want native types to be boxed.
05:19:12 <mmorrow> yeah, currently i don't have a heap object type for ints/floats/etc. i'm gonna add that though (this looks like how ghc/yhc do it)
05:19:59 <mmorrow> (btw i'm working on an implem of this http://serv1.ist.psu.edu:8080/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.81.7841)
05:22:15 <mmorrow> yeah, the problem i'm hitting is how to distinguish ptrs and literals both on the stack and in a heap object
05:22:52 <yitz> mmorrow: cool
05:22:54 <mmorrow> that spec doesn't really highlight this issue
05:23:11 <mmorrow> yitz: yeah, it's interesting for sure
05:23:59 <yitz> mmorrow: are you doing it as a simple interpreter, or as a jit compiler?
05:24:32 <mmorrow> i've done the compiler part in haskell, and am writing the interpreter/gc/etc in C
05:24:59 <mmorrow> but after i get this working i want to look into a jit or something for sure
05:25:39 <Saizan> how do you get laziness without boxing? or are you specifically talking about literals?
05:25:45 <mmorrow> (i haven't done the serialization of the instruction to the binary fmt yet either, but i've got compilation from that "LVM" lang to byecode done)
05:25:56 <mmorrow> Saizan: specifically literals
05:26:25 <mmorrow> so the equiv of Int# i guess
05:28:30 <lilac> is linearity comonadic?
05:28:57 <mmorrow> yitz, Saizan: here's my gc http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=987#a987
05:29:32 <mmorrow> it's stop-the-world, but i want to see if i can't make it concurrent (like TIMBER's) after i get everything working
05:30:42 <mmorrow> timber's rts code is short and sweet
05:34:30 <asgaroth> What's a secure(e.g. not vulnerable to symlink attacks and such) way of creating a temporary file with a random name?
05:34:38 <mmorrow> err, i meant s/concurrent/incremental/
05:35:11 <mmorrow> (but concurrent would be even cooler)
05:35:49 <mmorrow> asgaroth: is the way that mktemp does is ok?
05:36:30 <asgaroth> mmorrow: ah, yes. I just searched for tmpnam and didn't found it, so I forgot to search for it
05:36:39 <asgaroth> *find

06:10:40 <true\false> Quick question.. I'm trying to learn from Real world haskell
06:11:02 <SamB_XP> true\false: and you found an error ?
06:11:08 <true\false> The real problem is I'm getting 3/4 through chapter 4 and just finding I have absolutely no experience with Haskell
06:11:28 <true\false> So I really don't know how this stuff fits in, and it's just not sinking in
06:11:55 <true\false> Not an error, just finding it awkward from not actually writing apps in any form, wondering if there were any decent links for begginer, concise tutorials?
06:12:31 <jeffz`> there's always learnyouahaskell.com
06:12:49 <chessguy_work> true\false, there are a number of very good case studies in the book too
06:13:03 <SamB_XP> well, I guess you probably don't want the [not so] Gentle Introduction to Haskell
06:13:11 <chessguy_work> starting in chapter 5
06:13:40 <ozy`> true\false: I didn't read RWH until I'd already gone through four or five dense tutorials, none of which I understood. typing all that code, though, and getting used to the syntax (and the type of errors you get from incorrect indentation :p) helped prepare me a lot
06:13:44 <true\false> Hrm, so do you think what.. try and persevere.. Any thing really not going in, come back to later, and go onto chapter 5?
06:13:52 <boegel> true\false: have you tried the exercises?
06:14:03 <true\false> I have yes.. The ones I tried I can generally do
06:14:21 <boegel> true\false: then you should stick to it, I think it'll be worth while in the end
06:14:35 <boegel> true\false: or try implementing something simple with what you already know
06:14:52 <boegel> true\false: although you might need to read on until chapter 7 to be able to to that
06:15:10 <SamB_XP> you can come back to Chapter 4 later
06:15:16 <true\false> Was about to say that.. I haven't a clue what the entry point method needs at its most basic level etc...
06:15:26 <SamB_XP> you mean main ?
06:15:32 <true\false> Yes
06:15:47 <SamB_XP> chapter 7 should help
06:16:10 <true\false> So .. Read chapt 5, 6 then 7, and see how it goes?
06:16:11 <SamB_XP> seeing as main :: IO ()
06:16:42 <boegel> true\false: yeah, I think you need to hold on until chapter 7
06:16:50 <SamB_XP> of course, you don't need to write *programs*, anyway
06:16:50 <BONUS> have you chezched out LYAH? one of the intentions i had when writing it was for people who to read it before they go into RWH, so they "get" haskell when doing RWH
06:16:53 <SamB_XP> you could just write libraries
06:16:58 <boegel> true\false: and keep playing around with ghci to try small stuff
06:16:59 <SamB_XP> those are often more fun anyway ;-P
06:17:17 <boegel> BONUS: cool website bt :)
06:17:19 <boegel> *btw
06:17:24 <BONUS> thanks :]
06:17:26 <true\false> Heh well I'm actually wanting to write a server application, using serialization and a DB
06:17:30 <SamB_XP> isn't that spelled "chzech"?
06:17:38 <BONUS> i always misspell that :[
06:17:43 <Dessous> czech
06:17:45 <ozy`> czech.
06:17:48 <SamB_XP> ah.
06:17:52 <BONUS> wait no its czech yeha
06:17:55 <SamB_XP> well, my point was that the z was before the e
06:17:58 <true\false> Would be fun trying to get that to work with a C#/.NET client application :)
06:18:12 <true\false> Anyhow, thanks for the input.. I'll give it until Sunday
06:20:34 <ozy`> (is "Czech" valid Czech? I thought <č> was the spelling for /tʃ/...)
06:21:35 <BONUS> i think it's valid in english. in slovenia we say "eki"
06:22:27 <SamB_XP> what the ?
06:22:30 <pumpkin> èeki to you too!
06:22:37 <SamB_XP> that looks like chinese ...
06:23:03 <pumpkin> čestina
06:24:27 <ozy`> BONUS: the <Cz> must have come via Polish or Hungarian. the fact that nobody can remember how to spell it is evidence enough it's not English ;)
06:24:46 <BONUS> haha
06:25:40 <ozy`> and SamB_XP, switch to UTF-8 >_>
06:26:15 <SamB_XP> what the heck
06:26:31 <SamB_XP> I thought I was using UTF-8
06:27:01 <SamB_XP> <BONUS> i think it's valid in english. in slovenia we say "鐺嗅i"
06:27:19 <SamB_XP> that's what I saw
06:27:19 <ozy`> that should be "<e-grave>eki"
06:27:26 <yitz> SamB_XP: you speak chinese in slovenia?
06:27:31 <BONUS> haha, that's character sets for you
06:27:32 <asgaroth> Did anyone get the plugins package from hackage to compile with a recent cabal(1.6)?
06:27:51 <dcoutts_> asgaroth: the problem is the recent ghc, not the recent cabal
06:28:00 <SamB> ozy`: I see what it should be
06:28:24 <asgaroth> dcoutts_: Ah, ok. I assumed it to be cabal, since the version constraints say that, but I guess i refers to the version shipped with ghc
06:28:28 <asgaroth> *it refers
06:29:31 <dcoutts_> asgaroth: oh it may well need an older cabal too
06:33:33 <CosmicRay> Does http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/test-framework/0.2.0/doc/html/Test-Framework-Options.html look totally messed up for anyone else?
06:34:05 <jeffz`> CosmicRay: yes
06:34:08 <koeien> yes
06:34:13 <quicksilver> CosmicRay: CSS file missing, looks like to me
06:34:15 <koeien> css has 404
06:34:21 <CosmicRay> I wonder why it's that particular project only
06:34:37 <CosmicRay> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/test-framework/0.2.0/doc/html/Test-Framework.html appears even worse
06:34:39 <Deewiant> CosmicRay: my locally-built docs of said file work
06:34:44 <bolrod>  /win 2
06:34:46 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: can you fix this?
06:35:20 <dcoutts_> CosmicRay: I can't even download that page
06:35:36 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: who can fix it?
06:35:48 <dcoutts_> CosmicRay: it's not clear to me what the problem is
06:36:02 <jeffersonheard> morning...  what's the proper way to run a modal dialog in Gtk2hs?   I get something borderless that won't allow text entry on Windows (it works on Linux)

06:36:10 <CosmicRay> dcoutts: can you pull up that first URL?  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/test-framework/0.2.0/doc/html/Test-Framework.html
06:36:11 <Igloo> It looks like haddock got killed when creating it or something
06:36:14 <CosmicRay> the css page 404s
06:36:42 <dcoutts_> CosmicRay: yes, lots of file missing http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/test-framework/0.2.0/doc/html/
06:36:43 <Igloo> Or maybe it just failed
06:36:54 <dcoutts_> haddock gets run on a different box
06:37:00 <dcoutts_> and the results are uploaded
06:37:44 <yitz> dcoutts_: can you just manually upload haddock.css to that directory?
06:39:35 <dcoutts_> yitz: no, I do not have permissions
06:40:37 <yitz> any galois folks around?
06:41:28 <CosmicRay> dcoutts_: who does?
06:41:42 <CosmicRay> dcoutts_: your image as the lead wizard of the cabal is on the line!
06:42:01 <dcoutts_> you can ask ross to kill off the existing docs and have the build re-run
06:42:27 <dcoutts_> CosmicRay: I've never had admin access on the server where the hackage website is hosted.
06:42:27 <SamB> dcoutts: I thought you had root
06:42:42 <SamB> oh, that isn't on nun ?
06:42:46 <dcoutts_> SamB: on the community server and the haskell.org server I do
06:43:00 <yitz> SamB: hackage is on monk
06:43:00 <dcoutts_> no, hackage.haskell.org is the galois server
06:43:05 <SamB> ah
06:43:59 * dcoutts_ notes that with the new hackage-server this would never be a problem
06:44:36 <dcoutts_> since if an auto-builder uploaded corrupted docs the package author could upload their own
06:45:40 <dcoutts_> and we ought to be able to validate the doc upload slightly better
06:45:45 <true\false> What's the Haskell equivelant of readln?
06:46:00 <CosmicRay> getLine?
06:46:03 <CosmicRay> see System.IO
06:46:05 <dcoutts_> @hoogle getline
06:46:05 <lambdabot> Prelude getLine :: IO String
06:46:06 <lambdabot> Data.ByteString getLine :: IO ByteString

06:46:26 <asgaroth> Is there some way to get non-show-able data structures passed to another (haskell) program?
06:47:07 <koeien> asgaroth: well, you should be able to represent them in some way
06:47:31 <koeien> Read/Show is one way
06:47:45 <asgaroth> koeien: In that case, they also contain stuff like functions.
06:47:53 <koeien> @hoogle binary
06:47:53 <lambdabot> package binary
06:47:53 <lambdabot> package binary-search
06:47:53 <lambdabot> package binary-strict
06:48:10 <jeffersonheard> okay, seriously...  even widgetShowAll gives me a centered window on the parent with no window manager decoration
06:48:11 <koeien> binary is far more efficient
06:48:24 <koeien> functions? that'll be hard
06:50:33 <asgaroth> Perhaps I'm on the wrong track anyway: I'm trying to be able to evaluate haskell expressions at runtime that need access to these non-show-able data structures.
06:54:16 <chessguy> i'm surprised there's not a class (Monad m) => Runnable r where run :: m a -> a
06:54:16 <lambdabot> chessguy: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
06:55:04 <chessguy> err

06:56:35 <boegel> how long would it take to build GHC on a 3.0GHz Pentium 4?
06:58:19 <jeffersonheard> boegel: with or without extralibs?
06:58:28 <jeffersonheard> boegel: or do you mean 6.10?
06:58:34 <Itkovian> boegel: can't you use the binary distr?
06:58:56 <Itkovian> iirc you will need a binary version anyway
06:59:51 <gwern> > 2001 - 1993
06:59:52 <lambdabot>   8
07:02:56 <boegel> jeffersonheard, Itkovian: I'm using Gentoo, and I'm installing the 6.8 version using Portage
07:03:04 <boegel> gwern: ??
07:03:11 <gwern> boegel: ?
07:03:17 <Itkovian> boegel: there should be a binary version in portage, no?
07:03:32 <boegel> gwern: why do you need lambdabot to determine 2001-1993?
07:03:36 <Itkovian> gwern: I think you meant to compute 2009 - 1994
07:03:50 <boegel> Itkovian: the whole point of Gentoo is compiling something during install, right? to optimize it?
07:03:51 <Itkovian> and yes it's 15 yars since Kurt met a bullet
07:03:58 <jeffersonheard> boegel: there is a binary version in portage.  use that.  building from source won't buy you anything with GHC, because it bootstraps from binary anyway
07:04:00 <Itkovian> boegel: yeah, normally :-)
07:04:03 <boegel> Itkovian: today?
07:04:12 <Itkovian> Nah somewehere in April
07:04:14 <Itkovian> 4th I think
07:04:22 <Itkovian> or 30th

07:04:33 <Itkovian> @google Cobain death data
07:04:33 <gwern> boegel: I can do it myself, but I always check my math for a contentious comment, since there is little more utterly humiliating than a brainfart causing you to get simple arithmetic wrong

07:05:29 <Itkovian> Luckily not April 12th
07:05:34 <Itkovian> Or Veerle would freak out.

07:07:14 <Itkovian> nope, but close

07:09:42 <neurogeek||m> Hello guys, can you help me out with this? Im just stuck... I have a list like this: [ [], [1], [1,1], [2], [2,1] ] where those elements represent "levels", meaning [] is the root, [1] and [2] are at the same level as well as [1,1] [2,1].
07:10:33 <neurogeek||m> And what im unsuccessfully trying to achieve is to extract the external parallel positions in each turn..

07:12:31 <asgaroth> neurogeek||m: Hmm, I'm not sure I have understood your representation, but couldn't you sort the list by the lengths?
07:12:32 <lambdabot>   [[[]],[[1]],[[1,1]],[[2]],[[2,1]]]
07:12:49 <neurogeek||m> asgaroth, yes.. could be

07:14:31 <asgaroth> neurogeek||m: It looks to me though that you might want another structure to represent that, e.g. a tree.
07:14:38 <gnuvince> :t comparing
07:14:40 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Ord a) => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Ordering
07:15:05 <yitz> neurogeek||m: so you'll need to import on from Data.Function and comparing from Data.Ord to do that (and sortBy and groupBy from Data.List)
07:15:09 <idnar> comparing = (compare `on`)

07:15:26 <neurogeek||m> asgaroth, indeed, the thing is that to do that, I have to rewrite my last project :S
07:15:31 <neurogeek||m> i dont have the time
07:16:10 <neurogeek||m> I might change it later, but I have to finish this first.. but indeed a tree would be a better suit
07:16:18 <neurogeek||m> yitz, thanks!
07:16:20 <yitz> neurogeek||m: also, note that we're counting the lengths of those things many many times.

07:21:14 <bastl> I try to build the (had)docs for hint 0.3.1, but cabal reports missing dependencies. ghc-pkg finds to packages conf: the one under ~/.ghc contains the missing dependencies. Whats going wrong here?
07:21:27 <bastl> (i installed ghc 6.10.1 under /opt recently)
07:21:57 <bastl> s/to/two/
07:22:17 <dcoutts_> bastl: you mean ghc-pkg list says the packages are installed but runghc Setup configure says they're missing?
07:22:25 <bastl> yep
07:22:54 <dcoutts_> bastl: if you installed those dependencies as user rather than global packages then use --user when configuring
07:23:06 <dcoutts_> bastl: or just use cabal-install
07:23:07 <bastl> ah.
07:23:21 <dcoutts_> as it defaults to user installs
07:23:50 <bastl> it is installed with cabal install, but i have to build the docs myself. out of some reason, there is nothing on hackage for üpackage "hint"
07:24:14 <dcoutts_> bastl: you can use cabal install hint --enable-documentation
07:24:56 <bastl> oh.
07:28:12 <CosmicRay> weird.  you can apparently convert a CTime to a POSIXTime, but not the other way around?

07:31:39 <dormoose> When using --make, I get the same error at runtime.
07:31:46 <Axman6> that's usually the cause of linter errors in my experience...
07:31:49 <Axman6> ah, lame
07:31:54 <dormoose> So it's a runtime error.

07:36:47 <quicksilver> that's reasonable.
07:36:55 <quicksilver> just make the strongs nice and long and trackable ;)
07:37:09 <bastl> gnn, damn type safety. how can i make a String to a Int most painless?
07:37:15 <quicksilver> "error" should be used for things like This should never have happened!

07:37:54 <revertTS> I got to ch. 8 in RWH and I'm not quite understanding this bit; it seems to be saying that tail recursion is less essential than in Scheme/etc. because of the laziness
07:37:58 <revertTS> would that be an accurate statement?
07:38:50 <zachk> reverts: using the iterative form of recursion (helper variables) will keep you from blowing the stack up in haskell
07:39:13 <dormoose> quicksilver: Yea.. Thanks for the input
07:39:52 <zachk> bastl: (show IntVariable) and you will get a string back
07:40:04 <dormoose> revertTS: 99% of the time, you don't need recursion at all -- it can be handled with maps, folds and the like.
07:40:04 <quicksilver> revertTS: tail recursion is not important for recursive functions which produce data which can be consumed 'gradually'
07:40:12 <zachk> oh nevermind bastl
07:40:22 <quicksilver> revertTS: this is basically because haskell can garbage collect "stack frames" as you go along
07:40:27 <quicksilver> (they're not really stack frames)
07:40:47 <chrisdone> no one seems to be replying from haskell-cafe-owner@haskell.org, is there somewhere else I can email to get help with haskell-cafe?

07:41:44 <pejo> chrisdone, different email than the one you subscribed with?
07:42:23 <drdozer> is it possible on the command-line cabal to discover which package provides which module?
07:42:37 <chrisdone> pejo: not to my knowledge, I subscribed as chrisdone@gmail.com and get all the haskell-cafe sent to my inbox and have for months, but I can't send anything
07:43:10 <chrisdone> it's kind of frustrating but I have no idea who to ask to sort this
07:43:55 <asgaroth> How do I unhide a hidden module of a specific package? (I know that generally one shouldn't do that, but I just want to test something)
07:44:03 <dcoutts_> drdozer: not at the moment, but for installed packages ghc-pkg find-module can tell you
07:44:21 <pejo> chrisdone, I'm not sure if gmail allows it, but often you can set the sender to whatever you want (like say, your school/work adress for example).
07:44:53 <asgaroth> drdozer: If it isn't installed, you could use hayoo(maybe write a little script to query it from the command line)
07:45:05 <drdozer> dcoutts_, asgaroth : thanks
07:45:08 <chrisdone> pejo: but I'm sending with the same email address that I'm subscribed with! ;_;
07:45:21 <pejo> chrisdone, other than that I don't know, I'd check with the owner.
07:45:21 <yitz> pejo: you can set "from", but "sender" is always the gmail address.
07:45:25 <byorgey> chrisdone: how did you subscribe? through the mailman interface?
07:45:32 <chrisdone> pejo: I sent an email to the owner months ago but got no reply
07:45:43 <chrisdone> byorgey: yes, I'm logged into it now
07:45:43 <pejo> yitz, true.
07:46:04 <chrisdone> this link: http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe
07:46:28 <dcoutts_> drdozer: it should be possible with cabal list, but it isn't yet. If you want to hack on it I can point out the tickets.
07:46:33 <chrisdone> byorgey: should I have signed up a different way?
07:46:38 <JaffaCake> chrisdone: can I help?  I admin haskell-cafe

08:13:03 <augustss> icqn: but if that depends depends on the strictness of step
08:13:57 <icqn> augustss, hold on, i was only asking for the first mistake :-P
08:14:41 <augustss> well, the duplication of 8 I can forgive, it's hard to illustrate textually
08:15:14 <augustss> icqn: also, duplicating 8 is not really a mistake.  Haskell doesn't prescribe how sharing is done.
08:15:32 <quicksilver> augustss: surely it is a mistake.
08:15:42 <quicksilver> foldr only captures 3 parameters
08:15:48 <quicksilver> step, id and the list
08:15:53 <quicksilver> the 4th parameter (8) must wait
08:16:08 <quicksilver> until the the foldr has reduced into a form which can accept a parameter.
08:16:16 <augustss> quicksilver: oops, yes.  you're right
08:16:31 <augustss> I thought it was just a sharing thing

08:17:26 <xmux> This is, by far, the best State Monad tutorial on the internet.  On the somethingawful forums!
08:17:54 <augustss> ghc must have one of the worst build systems ever
08:17:57 <quicksilver> I love bonus's pictures
08:18:00 <xmux> bonus needs to include that in lyahfgg

08:18:39 <quicksilver> xmux: what is "somethingawful" anyway?
08:19:07 <xmux> Hmm, hard to describe really
08:19:14 <xmux> It's a community
08:19:33 <xmux> A huge forum about nothing in particular
08:19:46 <eve> does anyone know if there is a way to detect a username and password to display different webpages when they login with php?
08:19:51 <xmux> I found this by accident by googling for something else
08:20:37 <sbahra> eve, #PHP?
08:20:58 <eve> for example same login screen, customers logs in gets customer logged in screen, admin logs in they get admin login screen
08:21:07 <jeffz`> eye, this isn't the channel to ask in.
08:21:10 <arw> i can remember eve from last week.
08:21:12 <jeffz`> eve, try #php
08:21:25 <eve> ooo im in haskel thought i was in php sorry
08:22:17 * maltem wonders if talking of the "best state monad tutorial ever" in #haskell has a similar effect as "hot women, click here" elsewhere
08:22:48 <chrisdone> more like "boobs, click here!"
08:22:51 <ozy`> quicksilver: it's 4chan with moderation, for all senses of the word "moderation."
08:23:04 <ozy`> also, intellect.
08:23:05 <chrisdone> everyone's seen boobs before; even bored slightly
08:23:24 <xmux> Yeah, I was going to compare it to 4chan
08:23:53 <chrisdone> it is in fact from where 4chan sprang
08:24:11 <xmux> I wonder how many other gems bonus has hiding in random places on the internet
08:24:54 <chrisdone> Real World Haskell's monad tutorial is perfect
08:25:21 <ozy`> yeah, so long as you work through the parts leading up to it :p
08:25:49 <xmux> RWH is the reason I need state monad tutorials in the first place
08:26:10 <xmux> Chapter 10 is still a mystery to me
08:26:23 * quicksilver hasn't looked at chapter 10.
08:26:34 <quicksilver> I just keep RWH on my desk as a talisman to ward off evil spirits.
08:26:38 <quicksilver> And tempt co-workers.
08:26:52 * chrisdone laughs
08:27:00 * augustss has repeatedly failed to buy RWH.
08:27:19 <xmux> I didn't look at it either at first because parsing bitmaps did not sound like an application I am very interested in, but it's not about that at all
08:27:23 <augustss> It's always sold out.
08:27:42 <chrisdone> I'm going to buy it when I can next afford it
08:27:48 <xmux> It's about trying to sneak the state monad into your brain without calling it that and hoping that it won't be hard to understand that way
08:27:56 <Axman6> quicksilver: and so you can say "oh hey, you like the book. yeah, i talk to the authors all the time, we're bros man"?
08:28:59 <quicksilver> Axman6: not specially. More to see if they can see the advantages over what we use in-house (Perl).
08:29:20 <icqn> Is it correct now? http://codepad.org/MdQw2T5U
08:29:24 <osfameron> augustss: I got Josette from the O'Reilly user groups program to send a copy (with the user group discount and great haste)
08:29:26 <Axman6> i tried to hack some perl recently, i was not fun
08:29:58 <augustss> I've just tried to buy RWH in real book stores.
08:30:09 <Axman6> though, i was trying to call HsColour from inside perl (and calling it HsColor because i assumed it would use the american spelling)
08:30:12 * loadquo will get a version of RWH one day, he's just trying to decide between dead tree now or pdf when ebook readers become good
08:30:29 <chrisdone> they say perl is a write-only language
08:30:31 <asgaroth> Why does hint not export unsafeInterpret (I know one shouldn't use it, but there may be cases where it's needed)
08:30:45 <vixey> ~ but it's not the only one ~
08:31:10 * chrisdone laughs
08:31:46 <ozy`> I wanna see a language that combines the cool parts of APL and perl, but readable
08:32:07 <osfameron> ozy`: perl 6!
08:32:15 <augustss> COBOL was designed to be readable...
08:32:25 * osfameron twitches violently at the mention of COBOL
08:32:27 <vixey> SET COBOL IS READABLE
08:32:38 <chrisdone> loadquo: nice thing about dead tree is that you can throw it across a room or slam it on someone's desk and say "READ THAT", whereas with an ebook, you can't really slam or throw anything. you just sit and watch a transfer or provide download details
08:33:06 <ozy`> osfameron: hmm, I know perl has implicit promotion of scalars to vectors in some places... does it also do implicit lifting and such?
08:33:21 <augustss> chrisdone: you can slam your ebook reader...
08:33:33 <ozy`> (and perl 6 allows you to define infix operators with any name)
08:33:46 <chrisdone> augustss: but hows a broken ebook reader know what ebooks is?
08:34:18 <ozy`> augustss: COBOL was designed to be readable for non-programmers :\
08:34:29 <icqn> Is the manual evaluation of the example myfoldl (*) 8 [1,2,3] correct?  http://codepad.org/MdQw2T5U
08:34:54 <icqn> augustss, quicksilver, what do you say?
08:35:09 <loadquo> chrisdone: Well true. I've got enough other dead tree books though. I'll slam something really boring down, and then send them a link to the web site....
08:35:46 <quicksilver> icqn: that looks right to me.
08:35:47 <chrisdone> I have found hacking on existing haskell projects to be easy. lisp to be quite hard, scheme about the same and emacs lisp to be impossible. perl is been okay for understanding even though I don't know it mostly because it's written with lame abstractions, ..
08:36:03 <chrisdone> loadquo: yes, I can see how that would be convincing
08:37:03 <augustss> icqn: but the order in which you evaluate is not necessarily the order a Haskell implementation will do it.
08:38:22 <augustss> icqn: after 10 you'll probably expand step rather than the argument to step
08:38:24 <icqn> augustss, Yes, i realize this, step can be already evaluated in line 10

08:38:46 <vermifom> Anyone ver hear of a haskell binding for the redland RDf C Libraries?
08:38:55 <ketil> Apparently, the bot is not cooperative.
08:39:06 <ozy`> @slap COBOL
08:39:06 * lambdabot loves COBOL, so no slapping

08:39:28 <ketil> gwern, Thanks for the messages!
08:39:43 <gwern> ketil: welcome
08:39:45 <ketil> 'parently, \bot doesn't give them until you speak in public.
08:40:10 <gwern> if course
08:40:11 <ketil> so I didn't receive them until now - but yes, someone told me, and I think it's fixed in the darcs repo.
08:40:43 <ketil> I'll pull things together and stuff it into hackagedb.
08:41:59 <quicksilver> ketil: there is a lesson you should learn here.
08:42:25 <icqn> augustss, quicksilver, Thank you.
08:42:26 <ketil> Well - I've /msg'ed the bot often enough, and it thinks I'm 'seen'... so I don't see why it should wait for my voice.
08:42:32 <ketil> quicksilver, which one?
08:42:46 <quicksilver> ketil: talk more in #haskell :)
08:42:58 <ketil> Ah, yes.
08:43:14 <multiholle> i am writing a game using gtk. sometimes the game crashes clicking on the surface of the game while a loop with "threadDelay" runs. i don't know where to look for the reason :/
08:43:28 <ketil> I now know who my real friends are.  :-)
08:43:53 <quicksilver> multiholle: are you trying to mix threads and gtk in an evil way? :)
08:44:08 <quicksilver> gtk wants to control your main loop and needs to only be called from the 'main' thread.
08:44:22 <quicksilver> if you want to thread alongside gtk you need to be careful.
08:45:15 <multiholle> quicksilver: maybe. i'm not sure whether using threads
08:45:42 <quicksilver> do you ever call "forkIO" or "forkOS" ?
08:45:59 <quicksilver> if not, you're not using threads.
08:46:04 <quicksilver> it's not easy to use them by mistake :)
08:46:32 <multiholle> i never called forkIO or forkOS
08:46:48 <quicksilver> then that sounds weird.
08:47:01 <quicksilver> I mean, calling threadDelay whilst using GTK is an odd thing to do
08:47:05 <quicksilver> but causing crashes...
08:47:06 <quicksilver> hmm...
08:47:20 <gwern> I've seen use of yield with threaddealy
08:47:26 <lilac> @slap Haskell
08:47:27 * lambdabot locks up Haskell in a Monad
08:49:22 <multiholle> onButtonPress starts a loop which runs for minutes including threadDelay. onExpose draws the game new on the canvas. clicking or draging on the surface hangs up the game.
08:49:42 <quicksilver> ah hang on
08:49:48 <quicksilver> "hangs up the game" is not crashing
08:49:57 <quicksilver> which is it?
08:50:03 <quicksilver> I thought you meant a segfault or something.
08:50:19 <shukhov> @slap lambdabot
08:50:20 * lambdabot jabs lambdabot with a C pointer
08:50:35 <quicksilver> if you spend minutes in an event handler
08:50:41 <quicksilver> then no other events will get processed
08:50:47 <quicksilver> that's the nature of single-threaded event loops.
08:51:19 <multiholle> onExpose don'T have to work
08:51:21 <gio123> ketil: who
08:51:39 <multiholle> during the event
08:51:54 <mmorrow> yeah, it seems like threadDelay would interfere with gtk's eventloop (since threadDelay is happening in the rts eventloop)
08:52:09 <Badger> @hoogle newStdGen
08:52:09 <lambdabot> System.Random newStdGen :: IO StdGen
08:52:21 <drdozer> I'm having trouble using fromConstr/readConstr/dataTypeOf
08:52:28 <multiholle> what could i do?
08:52:43 <mmorrow> is there some equiv function that happens in gtk's eventloop?
08:53:18 <multiholle> mmorrow: what do you mean?
08:53:39 <quicksilver> multiholle: the point is that clicking and dragging won't do anything
08:53:47 <quicksilver> multiholle: whilst your onButtonPress handler is running
08:53:50 <mmorrow> like, does the gtk lib give you some sort of "threadDelay"/"pause"/"sleep" function or something
08:53:51 <mmorrow> ?
08:53:53 <quicksilver> (for some minutes, apparently)
08:54:01 <mmorrow> oh
08:54:16 <quicksilver> mmorrow: gtk gives you idle and timer events which are the correct way to handle this if you don't want to thread.
08:54:21 <mmorrow> (yeah, bear in mind i'm just randomly guessing here what's happening)
08:54:36 <mmorrow> quicksilver: ah, cool. so it is that then?
08:54:44 <multiholle> quicksilver: clicking and dragging shouldn't do something
08:54:55 <multiholle> while onButtonPress is active
08:55:10 <quicksilver> then I'm not understanding what you're saying.
08:55:19 <mmorrow> yeah, me neither
08:56:04 <CyberGarp> I'm using HOpenGL, and I've got a memory leak I can't figure out. Code: c' <- iter c; (cells state) $=! c' , the types are iter :: Population -> IO Population, and cells state is an IORef.
08:57:09 <quicksilver> it seems likely that iter builds up large thunks.
08:57:28 <multiholle> i am using onExpose to draw the game on a canvas. onButtonPress starts a loop that controls the ki. the loop uses threaddelay and also prints the game on the canvas after every loop. while the loop is active an i klick on the canvas the game hangs up instead of doing nothing
08:58:53 <mmorrow> i'm pretty sure that threadDelay will completely hang your prog if you're single threaded.
08:59:23 <quicksilver> well, only for as long as you delay.
08:59:29 <mmorrow> so, once onButtonPress gets called and it calls threadDelay, you're frozen until it's over
08:59:30 <mmorrow> yeah
09:00:11 <mmorrow> what are you trying to do with threadDelay is what i don't understand
09:00:22 <mmorrow> *what you're trying ..
09:01:06 <quicksilver> I don't understand either what multiholle is trying to do, nor what he is actually seeing :)
09:01:23 <multiholle> can i upload my game somewhere=
09:01:25 <multiholle> ?

09:09:33 <BONUS> haha
09:10:10 <quicksilver> Philonous: System.Process
09:10:12 <quicksilver> (and yes)
09:10:34 <quicksilver> you will need to understand the implications of IO buffering and deadlocking though.
09:10:44 <Axman6> anyone remember who it was who was making that Mach-O binary parser?
09:10:45 <Philonous> Ah thanks.
09:11:03 <multiholle> quicksilver: http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=988#a995

09:11:53 <Axman6> ah

09:12:00 <lambdabot> (), (a -> b), (a, b), (a, b, c), All, Any, Dual a, Endo a, First a, Last a, Maybe a, Ordering, Product a, Sum a, [a]
09:12:40 <Philonous> quicksilver: I'm not sure I understand IO buffering. Where can I read about it? (Will google turn up something useful? )
09:17:20 <lilac> @hoogle Bifunctor
09:17:20 <lambdabot> No results found
09:21:36 <vermifom> @hoogle Redland
09:21:36 <lambdabot> No results found
09:24:35 <mmorrow> Philonous: it's just having an array of characters, and waiting until it fills up before dumping it to the output whatever and repeating
09:25:12 <mmorrow> since it's more efficient to write in blocks than it is to write out a byte at a time
09:26:10 <mmorrow> Axman6: was it erikc? i know he wrote elf and a dwarf ones
09:26:35 <stepcut> dons: runhaskell Setup haddock with haddock 2.4.1 fails with bytestring-lexing
09:26:44 <mmorrow> Philonous: (or analogously for input)
09:27:22 <rwbarton> Philonous: but there is also a buffer in the OS between the writing and reading programs and if the reading program doesn't read quickly enough, the writing program will fill up the buffer and then block
09:27:55 <rwbarton> the upshot is that it's basically impossible to control an external program without using select() or threads
09:28:15 <rwbarton> if you want to do it reliably, that is
09:28:40 <rwbarton> fortunately there are functions in System.Process that take care of this for you (and in Haskell it's not very hard in the first place)
09:30:46 <gwern> 'I think you are missing the point of fine typography (have a look at TeXmacs
09:30:47 <gwern> screenshots) neither Emacs nor Yi (both of which are egregious products) can
09:30:48 <gwern> provide comparable aestatically pleasant screen output.'
09:30:51 <gwern> *ouch*
09:30:58 <gwern> my main editors are emacs and yi :(
09:31:37 <gwern> (and I've spent quite a bit of time working on the pair)
09:32:33 <Philonous> Basically what I want to do is run different make scripts in parallel. All I care about atm is whether it return an error in the end or not.
09:32:45 <vixey> does anyone know some type system I could look at which has judgement like
09:32:49 <glguy> hello
09:32:49 <lambdabot> glguy: You have 2 new messages. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read them.
09:32:55 <vixey> context |- term : type : <some other information>
09:32:57 <multiholle> quicksilver: did you take a look?
09:33:00 <glguy> mmorrow, youabout?
09:33:00 <vixey> ?
09:33:10 <mmorrow> glguy: hi
09:33:21 <vixey> I just would be interested in such a thing (that at least has more info than just types)
09:33:22 <glguy> mmorrow, so'd we figure out that it doesn't quite work?
09:33:30 <CyberGarp> why would memory not be freed when assigning a new value to an IORef?
09:33:56 <mmorrow> glguy: what dolio was saying was that as-is Cont(T) doesn't have multiple prompts
09:34:08 <rwbarton> Philonous: you can use runCommand, and then waitForProcess when you want the error code
09:34:47 <mmorrow> but apparently you can get this by modifying the type of ContT, but the downside is that you'd need a different type of ContT for each of the control operators
09:35:40 <glguy> mmorrow, so it has a more limited form of delimited continuation then
09:35:59 <glguy> most of the reset/shift usage I've seen doesn't label the reset prompts
09:36:25 <mmorrow> glguy: i think so, but what i'm not clear on is whether having multiple prompts is the def of delimited conts or not
09:36:42 <glguy> mmorrow, doesn't seem to be according to Oleg's work or Wikipedia
09:36:53 <mmorrow> totally. dolio also said that multiple prompts are actually rarely used
09:37:34 <mmorrow> so it seems that Cont(T) shift/reset gives the most useful aspect of it
09:37:40 <andun> is there some way to forcefully align something with lhs2TeX?
09:38:42 <mmorrow> andun: heh, have you ever tried to tweak layout in latex?
09:38:57 <mmorrow> (it's excruciating :)
09:39:07 <andun> i'm thinking of something like &=& in eqnarray
09:39:10 <vixey> > runCont (do a <- callCC ; return 1) id
09:39:11 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `Cont r t'
09:39:17 <vixey> > runCont (do a <- callCC () ; return 1) id
09:39:19 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `(t -> Cont r b) -> Cont r t'
09:39:22 <SamB_irssi> mmorrow: I thought lhs2TeX was actually helpful with that kind of thing?
09:39:30 <andun> SamB_irssi: it is!
09:39:30 <vixey> @go trebla monad cont examples
09:39:32 <mmorrow> SamB_irssi: it might be, i'm not sure

09:56:38 <multiholle> mmorrow: do you have gtk2hs?
09:56:45 <mmorrow> multiholle: i don't
09:57:08 <multiholle> mmorrow: so you can't take a look at the game...
09:57:36 <mmorrow> i've never really used gtk2hs before..
09:58:13 <multiholle> who uses gtk2hs?
09:58:27 <mmorrow> multiholle: why were you using threadDelay again?
09:58:37 <mmorrow> threadDelay 1700000 -- omg :)
09:59:07 <kolmodin> does anyone else get this with xmobar? X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
09:59:13 <kolmodin> using ghc-6.10.1 on amd64
09:59:16 <mmorrow> are you trying to give some time for the user to react?
09:59:38 <mmorrow> because if so, you probably want to use the gtk-equivalent function, rather than threadDelay
09:59:53 <mmorrow> since threadDelay will cause your prog to freeze until it returns
09:59:55 <multiholle> no it's the time between the turns of the ai
10:00:04 <dcoutts_> threadDelay is fine if you're doing it in a thread, not in an event handler
10:00:16 <dcoutts_> a gtk2hs wrapper would enforce that with the types
10:00:25 <dcoutts_> no blocking in event handlers
10:00:27 <mmorrow> dcoutts_: he's doing it in an event handler :)
10:00:38 <dcoutts_> bad! wrong! :-)
10:00:45 <kolmodin> :)
10:01:08 <multiholle> the whole game: man-at-arms.de/risk_0_7_0.zip
10:01:27 <flipflop> hi.  I'm reading a Haskell book and it has an example involving guarded equations that uses the "|" symbol...  But with ghc, it gives a syntax error on that "|" symbol.  (The book's authors use Hugs)
10:01:31 <dcoutts_> the other one I'd enforce with types is only ever drawing in an expose handler, not at random other times
10:02:22 <multiholle> dcoutts: expose draws the game only when moving the window?
10:02:28 <rwbarton> flipflop: I'm guessing you're entering something at the ghci command line that you should be writing in a file and loading
10:02:31 <Philonous> @go rwh
10:02:32 <lambdabot> No Result Found.
10:02:59 <flipflop> rwbarton: you're guessing damn right...  (:
10:03:00 <flipflop> rwbarton: thank you
10:03:12 <dcoutts_> multiholle: if you need to redraw then you invalidate the bits that need redrawing. So it goes via the same path as expose events generated by moving windows etc.

10:04:07 <dcoutts_> multiholle: if you look at any of the gtk2hs demos that animate you'll see they use this technique. It's the right technique to use with gtk+.
10:06:34 <kolmodin> ah, the joy! darcs version of xmobar works for me, xmobar-0.9 does not

10:09:44 <kosmikus> andun: (lhs2TeX) have your questions been answered?
10:11:06 <andun> i guess noone knew. i'm wondering if it's possible to align two lines at a specific position (using some kind of annotation in the code)
10:11:32 <multiholle> dcoutts_: where do i find an easy animated example
10:11:33 <andun> i'm using lhs2TeX to write a report on a project, and i want my type annotations to be pretty
10:12:13 <beelsebob> andun: hmm? using spaces?
10:12:19 <beelsebob> I'm not getting what you mean here
10:12:44 <andun> i'm using the polycode style, so spaces doesn't work
10:12:46 <kosmikus> andun: it's the standard behaviour of lhs2TeX to align where you want
10:12:58 <kosmikus> andun: what?
10:12:58 <roconnor> > 1170*1.07
10:12:59 <lambdabot>   1251.9
10:13:08 <beelsebob> andun: what the hell is polycode style?
10:13:24 <dcoutts_> multiholle: in the gtk2hs tarball gtk2hs/demo/cairo/Clock.hs and a few others, grep for uses of widgetQueueDraw
10:13:34 <andun> beelsebob: lhs2TeX --poly
10:13:41 <beelsebob> andun: oh, I see
10:13:44 <kosmikus> beelsebob: it's the lhs2TeX standard style
10:13:47 <beelsebob> no idea I'm afraid
10:14:10 <kosmikus> andun: what makes you say that spaces won't work. spaces are *the* way to indicate alignment
10:14:33 <andun> http://rafb.net/p/ggGcDa68.html this is an example
10:14:41 <dcoutts_> the alignment is lhs2tex is so slick
10:14:45 <dcoutts_> isin
10:15:08 <kosmikus> andun: you need two spaces at least to request alignment
10:15:11 <mmorrow> whoa, that's is pretty slick
10:15:18 <mmorrow> *that is
10:15:41 <kosmikus> mmorrow: I don't understand that remark.
10:15:56 <mmorrow> in reply to dcoutts_
10:16:03 <mmorrow> <dcoutts_> the alignment is lhs2tex is so slick
10:16:05 <andun> kosmikus: oh! that worked great. thanks :-D
10:16:06 <mmorrow> :)
10:16:31 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: if you tried it for real you would have that reaction :-)
10:16:31 <tromp__> the whoa suggests you're seeing it in action:)
10:16:49 <mmorrow> http://rafb.net/p/ggGcDa68.html
10:17:02 <mmorrow> that prompted by "whoa"
10:17:03 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: http://rafb.net/p/Emk7k911.html
10:17:06 <mmorrow> *my
10:17:27 <rwbarton> mmorrow: that's the input
10:17:32 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: that's the input form, well embeded in tex in \begin{code} \end{code}
10:17:33 <andun> lhs2TeX <3
10:17:42 <mmorrow> haha, oh
10:17:48 <mmorrow> wait, i'm confused
10:17:58 <rwbarton> lhs2Tex :: lhs -> tex
10:17:59 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: and it produces nice output with proportional fonts etc, but keeping the alignment
10:18:04 <mmorrow> so that paste is the layout of the /rendered/ code ?
10:18:25 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: no, it's the input, with the requested alignment marked up using spaces
10:18:33 <mmorrow> ohhhh, i see
10:18:39 <dcoutts_> note how it's still completely readable
10:18:41 <rwbarton> I think you're supposed to imagine the 'a's as really long types that you would want to put on separate lines and have line up
10:18:41 <andun> for those that may be interested, this is what it looks like now: http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~orbekk/pub/poly-ohyeah.png
10:18:45 <glguy> mmorrow, shift :: (RunContM m a, AbortM m b) => ((i -> m a) -> m b) -> m i
10:18:53 <glguy> mmorrow, almost there :-D
10:18:58 <mmorrow> heh, i mistook that for the output (which i thought was pretty slick ;)
10:19:10 <dcoutts_> mmorrow: heh
10:19:22 <mmorrow> glguy: sweetness
10:19:24 <andun> (that's the output)
10:19:25 <rwbarton> mmorrow is used to staring at things like

10:19:30 <rwbarton> , src 'gfoldl

10:19:35 <lunabot>                                                                           ...
10:19:35 <lunabot>                                                                           ...
10:19:42 <mmorrow> sadly this is true :)
10:22:01 <kosmikus> andun: why aren't you aligning the -> with the :: and so on?
10:22:44 <mmorrow> personally i like the '=>' under the :: as well
10:23:26 <andun> even better!
10:24:32 <yitz> kosmikus andun, I like andun's alignment. Matter of taste.
10:25:11 <andun> no, i agree with kosmikus. screenshot updated :)
10:25:35 <rwbarton> has anyone made a haddock- or hscolour-like program that does alignment (in HTML) like lhs2tex does?
10:28:08 <kosmikus> andun: here's my suggestion: http://people.cs.uu.nl/andres/FPhenotype.pdf
10:29:24 <kosmikus> rwbarton: I don't know. Actually, it'd be interesting to see whether HTML can even do it.
10:29:52 <multiholle> mmorrow: i think the real animation isn't the thing i wan't. i just wan't a delay between two turns of the artificial intelligence
10:31:15 <dcoutts_> kosmikus: presumably it works in lhs2tex because the tex macros can measure the length of runs of text
10:31:38 <dcoutts_> so you know the amount of padding to add
10:32:16 <tromp__> it's better to keep the => near the actual condition
10:32:17 <rwbarton> kosmikus: I think I see, you'd need to say "I want two successive tables where the first columns have the same width" for example
10:32:55 <tromp__> but the -> still look better in front...
10:32:57 <kosmikus> yes, basically, I have to be able to measure the exact text width of multiple pieces of text
10:32:58 <rwbarton> or, hmm.  that must not be exactly how the latex works
10:33:37 <kosmikus> I guess that's probably possible nowadays with a lot of javascript magic for HTML as well
10:33:41 <dcoutts_> rwbarton: tables would be too restrictive I think
10:34:26 <rwbarton> I think I need to look at some more typical lhs2tex output
10:34:42 <kosmikus> lhs2TeX doesn't make use of LaTeX tables.
10:35:35 <rwbarton> yeah, I realized eventually that wouldn't work.
10:35:38 <kosmikus> it's generating LaTeX code that in turn measures the lengths of the aligned blocks and then produces boxes and spaces as needed.
10:37:06 <rwbarton> I'm pretty sure the running example in the lhs2tex manual could be formatted with HTML tables.
10:38:14 <dcoutts_> rwbarton: I think the main difficulty would be working out the column widths
10:38:27 <dcoutts_> I'm not sure if auto sizing would work
10:38:39 <kosmikus> rwbarton: you mean the zip/zipWith/partition example?
10:38:59 <rwbarton> kosmikus: Yes
10:39:44 <kosmikus> rwbarton: the tricky thing there is that the alignment of the last two lines is rather independent of the alignment of the stuff before
10:40:41 <kosmikus> so how do you determine whether the |'s have to go before or after the ='s.
10:40:45 <rwbarton> yes, so the last two lines are their own table
10:40:57 <kosmikus> yes, in this case
10:41:01 <rwbarton> but again, maybe this isn't a sufficiently generic example
10:41:07 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: convertible 1.0.1
10:41:14 <kosmikus> but what if after that you have a fourth function that you want to align with the ='s again?
10:41:18 <rwbarton> if you move partition above zipWith, will the ...
10:41:30 <rwbarton> right, then you are in trouble
10:41:41 <kosmikus> yes, or permuting the three functions
10:41:41 <rwbarton> Well, you could use a colspan=2 table
10:42:06 <kosmikus> yes, if you already know where to put the colspan
10:42:20 <rwbarton> I entirely agree that it is probably very tricky :)
10:42:39 <kosmikus> it certainly can be done if there's a way to measure the text width
10:43:03 <kosmikus> and from what I know of the capabilities of today's browsers, I wouldn't be surprised if it can be done
10:43:17 <kosmikus> I'm just not an expert, and I'd need someone to explain it to me :)
10:43:49 <rwbarton> What I'd like even more is for the code to look like this in my editor, and there should be no problems there
10:44:01 <rwbarton> aside from editing the code while it's presented in this form
10:44:36 <kosmikus> personally, I don't care much about WYSIWYG editing
10:45:06 <rwbarton> Well, I mostly want my editor to keep things aligned for me
10:45:18 <kosmikus> ah, yes, I'd like that too
10:45:25 <kosmikus> I've even been thinking about this recently
10:46:03 <rwbarton> once you get that worked out, you might as well go all out and use proportional fonts and such
10:46:10 <kosmikus> but while I can see a way to write my own editor that can do this, I don't see an easy way of adding this functionality to any generic editor
10:46:28 <rwbarton> yeah
10:47:07 <rwbarton> I looked at yi several months ago to figure out whether it would be feasible to add this kind of thing, but it didn't seem ready yet
10:47:08 <stepcut> is there a way to get hackage to try to rebuild this package with out uploading a new version: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/ghc-mtl
10:47:14 <kosmikus> and to be honest, who would discard emacs or vim for my own editor just because it can keep track of code alignment
10:47:46 <kosmikus> rwbarton: actually, I've seen a yi demo that could at least preserve Haskell layout (i.e., indentation)
10:48:10 <rwbarton> kosmikus: ah, cool
10:48:24 <rwbarton> I was trying to use the gtk interface, which wasn't working well on my system
10:49:04 <SamB_irssi> kosmikus: do you mean "his own"?
10:49:06 <kosmikus> it's been a while since I tried yi, but then it worked well with both interfaces
10:49:45 <kosmikus> SamB_irssi: no, I mean "my own" as in "the one I might write"
10:51:14 <rwbarton> I was inspired by the "electric tabstops" plugin for gedit, which was fun but really couldn't quite handle Haskell syntax
10:51:33 <rwbarton> even if I didn't care about ghc being able to compile my programs :)
10:51:56 <kosmikus> I've never used gedit
10:54:47 <SamB_irssi> hmm, it'd be neat if the GHC profiler could be tought about container types, to help you figure out what's keeping stuff in memory ....
10:54:57 <inimino> (I'm not sure exactly what the previous discussion was about, but you can certainly get the size of a text run in HTML using JavaScript.)

11:00:12 <lambdabot> Yes, I'm here. I'm in #haskell.cz, #haskell-soc, #haskell-books, #haskell-blah, #haskell-freebsd, #macosx, #gentoo-uy, #gentoo-haskell, #friendly-coders, #dreamlinux-es, #concatenative, #arch-
11:00:13 <lambdabot> haskell, #functionaljava, #novalang, #darcs, #xmonad, #ghc, ##logic, #haskell-overflow and #haskell
11:00:22 <kosmikus> inimino: would you happen to know a good introduction about such measuring functions?
11:00:31 <rwbarton> Huh, isn't it usually a lot longer?
11:00:35 <inimino> kosmikus: sure just a moment
11:00:49 <SamB_irssi> okay, WHY does array require syb everywhere except nhc98?
11:01:26 <lilac> why does array require syb anywhere?
11:01:33 <rwbarton> instances maybe?
11:01:34 <inimino> kosmikus: see here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Determining_the_dimensions_of_elements , and also the referenced MSDN pages
11:01:35 <ehird> #functionaljava? x.x
11:02:31 <dcoutts_> SamB_irssi: array does not need syb anymore
11:02:37 <kosmikus> inimino: thanks. I'll try to have a look.
11:02:52 <Grizzly`> good evening.
11:03:27 <mak__> any one know are there any papers about haskell and evolution programming?
11:03:29 <Grizzly`> I'm having issues building type-level 0.2.2 :(
11:03:56 <vixey> what on earth is 'type-level' ?
11:04:20 <lilac> @hackage type-level
11:04:20 <lambdabot> http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/type-level
11:04:31 <rwbarton> It has type-level integers and maybe other stuff
11:04:31 <athos> let freedom ring!
11:04:36 <inimino> kosmikus: if you have a span that does not break across lines, it is easy as |var width = mySpan.clientWidth|, if you have text that breaks across lines things get a little more involved
11:04:48 <vixey> did anyone use type level integers in a real program?
11:05:04 <rwbarton> I do sometimes
11:05:06 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: what kind of issues?
11:05:32 <rwbarton> basically as a way to parameterize instances by integers
11:05:41 <kosmikus> inimino: well, the corresponding LaTeX stuff ignores line breaks, so I guess the HTML version could do so, too.
11:05:43 <rwbarton> e.g., modular arithmetic
11:06:25 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: What kind of issues?  It installed fine for me
11:07:21 <Grizzly`> kosmikus, when running Setup.hs build i get "src/Data/TypeLevel/Bool.hs:34:7: Could not find module `Data.Generics': it is a member of package base-3.0.3.0, which is hidden"
11:07:25 <Zao> kosmikus: Well, two linebreaks denote a paragraph in \LaTeX
11:07:57 <inimino> kosmikus: there's also this: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Element.getClientRects but it's not as widely supported in browsers
11:08:04 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: can you try using "cabal-install"?
11:08:25 <inimino> (but there are ways to get the same result on browsers that don't have it)
11:08:35 <quantax> is there a package with which I can compute binomial coefficients? I didn't find anything suitable. Or maybe I overlooked sth.
11:08:37 <kosmikus> Zao: yes, so what?
11:08:37 <Grizzly`> urm.... I guess... I'll try :)
11:08:52 <dcoutts_> Is anyone here using Windows Vista? Could you help me test the behaviour of the Haskell copyFile function with respect to file permissions / acls.
11:08:56 <kosmikus> inimino: thanks, but I hope the other one is sufficient.
11:09:11 <Badger> dcoutts_: sure.
11:09:27 <dcoutts_> Badger: In Win2k3 it seeps that copyFile does not copy permissions, just the read-only attribute. I'm trying to find out if that has changed.
11:09:31 <dcoutts_> seems
11:09:47 <Grizzly`> kosmikus, trying "cabal build" i get exactly the same error message
11:10:11 <Philonous> Will forkIO use Haskells lightweight threads when I don't compile with -threaded?
11:11:04 <quicksilver> forkIO is lightweight whether you use -threaded or not.
11:11:13 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: what version of ghc and of cabal?  (I think I mean the library, not the executable)
11:11:21 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: try "cabal install type-level"
11:11:32 <quicksilver> the difference is what the RTS does with the lightweight threads
11:11:32 <dcoutts_> Badger: for my test I created a empty file "foo" with default permissions, then change the permission so it is not writable by you, but not setting the read-only attribute.
11:11:49 <dcoutts_> Badger: then in ghci run System.Directory.copyFile "foo" "bar". Then inspect the permissions for "bar" and see if the ACL has been copied or not.
11:12:16 <SamB_irssi> Are infix type constructors an extension ?
11:12:18 <Grizzly`> rwbarton, ghc 6.10.1 (archlinux package) and the current cabal-install version that is current in archlinux, i have to check
11:12:24 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: Yes
11:12:25 <Philonous> rwh says "The threaded runtime library uses multiple operating system threads to run Haskell threads. It has somewhat more overhead for creating threads and using MVars" OS threads are not lightweight, are they?
11:12:33 <shukhov> anyone know what eljdc.o is?
11:12:35 <SamB_irssi> huh.
11:12:41 <Philonous> Ah, my bad.
11:12:53 <Philonous> It uses OS threads but not one for every forkIO
11:12:54 <shukhov> some error i get when trying to build wxHaskell.
11:12:59 <BrokenClockwork> what, there is no #java on freenode?
11:13:03 <BrokenClockwork> I am shocked
11:13:09 <dcoutts_> Badger: see, I'm trying to understand what's going on here: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/454
11:13:20 <dcoutts_> Badger: this seems to affect all installs with Cabal on Vista
11:13:28 <dcoutts_> and I'm trying to fix it for the next release
11:14:14 <SamB_irssi> I wonder why "syb" doesn't declare it's use ...
11:14:21 <Twey> BrokenClockwork: It's ##java
11:14:44 <Twey> Philonous: Yes, it uses them 'smartly'
11:14:51 <BrokenClockwork> ah I need to register it says
11:15:04 <Twey> (i.e. attempts to optimise based on number of cores &c.)
11:15:22 <rwbarton> It just uses the number of threads you specify with +RTS -N<n> doesn't it?
11:15:31 <rwbarton> OS threads I mean
11:15:37 <Twey> If you specify, yes
11:15:38 <SamB_irssi> huh, the GHC manual really ought to give the standardized name of each extension ...
11:15:43 <Badger> dcoutts_: hmm
11:15:43 <Grizzly`> this is very intresting... cabal install SEEMS to run through to the actual installation step when i run it as an ordinary user, but then it obviousely fails because i cannot copy the files to their target directories (permission denied).
11:16:01 <Badger> it negates hidden, and seems to also remove the allow perms I set on it.
11:16:14 <Grizzly`> so I tried to run it as root, but then it faisl again, with tjust the same error i got before when running cabal build (or Setup.hs) as user
11:16:20 <Twey> Badger: Yerwhat?
11:16:51 <dcoutts_> Badger: so the hidden attribute and the permission changes are not preserved by copyFile
11:16:58 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: strange. first, cabal install, when run as a user, doesn't usually try to copy files to any destination that should be forbidden
11:17:08 <dcoutts_> Badger: the copy ends up with all defaults?
11:17:13 <Twey> Does copyFile respect umask?
11:17:17 <Badger> looks that way
11:17:22 * Badger does another check.
11:17:23 <dcoutts_> Twey: we're talking about windows
11:17:29 <Twey> Oh
11:17:37 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: second, it seems the dependencies of typelevel are incorrect
11:17:48 <Grizzly`> kosmikus, urm.. i tell it --prefix=/usr/local, shouldn't i?
11:17:49 <dcoutts_> Badger: ok, thanks. That's the same behaviour as on older windows then. So I still cannot explain the cause of the problem.
11:18:18 <Twey> It's simple enough to wrap copyFile with something that also copies the attributes across
11:18:18 <Grizzly`> I don't think I want the stuff lying around in my home directory
11:18:21 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: if you run "cabal install" as a user, it by default installs to $HOME/.cabal
11:18:28 <Twey> No?
11:18:35 <dcoutts_> Twey: that's not the problem
11:18:36 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: ok
11:18:36 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: You should give it the --global flag instead
11:18:45 <Grizzly`> ahh... I'll try
11:18:54 <dcoutts_> Twey: the problem is copying permissions, or not doing, or half doing it
11:18:58 * Twey scrolled up, honestly.
11:18:59 <Grizzly`> urm.. as a user? or as root?
11:19:11 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: but it sounds like it is depending on something that exists in your user package configuration, but not the global one
11:19:11 <Grizzly`> as root it fails, of course
11:19:15 <multiholle> using gtk2hs to draw animations, how to create a delay of a few seconds?
11:19:21 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: another thing you can try to do is to edit the .cabal file
11:19:43 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: find the line saying "build-depends" and add a dependency to "syb"
11:19:56 <Badger> how curious
11:20:05 <Badger> it wants write access to copy.
11:20:09 <rwbarton> That ought not be necessary; it should build against base-3 by default, no?
11:20:11 <SamB_irssi> what ARE :*: and :+:?
11:20:16 <Grizzly`> rwbarton, that sounds reasonable. but i can not imagine how that happened. is there a way to remove the local user package configuration? there shouldn't be one here that is different to the global one right now
11:20:27 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: then try "runghc Setup build" and "runghc Setup install" again
11:20:28 <dcoutts_> Badger: copying a file over a file with the read-only attribute fails
11:20:29 <ozy`> @src (:+:)
11:20:29 <lambdabot> Source not found. My brain just exploded
11:20:36 <ozy`> @index (:+:)
11:20:36 <lambdabot> bzzt
11:20:39 <ozy`> psssht
11:20:40 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: Some bizarre outdated "Generics" (but not Data.Generics/SYB) I think?
11:20:44 <kosmikus> rwbarton: does it really, if there's just "base" in the dependencies?
11:20:53 <dcoutts_> Badger: that's not because it needs write access to the target file, but renaming a file over a file with the read-only attribute fails.
11:20:55 <Badger> dcoutts_: not read-only, I set write perms to deny
11:20:58 <ozy`> SamB_irssi: they're infix constructors
11:20:58 <SamB_irssi> rwbarton: for some reason Data.Generics is still trying to export them
11:21:06 <rwbarton> kosmikus: I think that's a special heuristic in sufficiently recent versions of Cabal
11:21:07 <SamB_irssi> rwbarton: who supports it ? anyone but GHC?
11:21:15 <Badger> the little read-only tickbox is happily unchecked.
11:21:18 <Grizzly`> kosmikus, will do
11:21:18 <dcoutts_> Badger: it does not write to the target file, it makes a temp file and renames over the target.
11:21:25 <ozy`> SamB_irssi: any operator beginning with : is a data constructor
11:21:31 <SamB_irssi> ozy`: I realize THAT
11:21:36 <ozy`> oh
11:21:40 <ozy`> well
11:21:40 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: I'm not sure even GHC really supports it
11:21:41 <Badger> dcoutts_: I mean on the source file
11:21:46 <SamB_irssi> or a tycon
11:21:53 <multiholle> exists an haskell forum?
11:22:06 <dcoutts_> Badger: oh, it fails to copy when write permission is denied on the source. That is very odd.
11:22:18 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: I believe it's related to -XGenerics, if that helps...
11:22:32 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: It has to do with this: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/generic-classes.html
11:22:54 <Twey> multiholle: http://www.google.com/search?q=haskell+forum
11:22:59 <vixey> Generic classes -- cool
11:23:01 <rwbarton> SamB_irssi: I've never seen anyone use it ever
11:23:16 <Grizzly`> ahhh
11:23:30 <dcoutts_> Badger: I guess the main test is: running as admin, create an .exe with ghc, check the permissions of the .exe, then still as admin, use ghci to copy the .exe into C:\Program Files\Haskell and check what the permissions end up as.
11:23:33 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: success?
11:23:45 <Grizzly`> kosmikus, rwbarton adding syb (whatever that is) to the build debs seemed to solve the problem
11:24:34 <Badger> dcoutts_: ah, scratch that
11:24:44 <Badger> I had previously copied and it had retained read-only.
11:24:46 <Grizzly`> I think that's non intuitive... if syb was installed at my system already, when difference should an entry in .cabal make?
11:24:59 <Badger> write-deny makes no difference.
11:25:15 <dcoutts_> Badger: ah ok, good
11:25:16 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: cabal tries to ensure that a package only makes use of declared dependencies
11:25:17 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: cabal always hides all packages not listed in the .cabal file, to force package authors not to accidentally lie about dependencies
11:25:19 <Badger> (just isn't retained.)
11:25:36 <multiholle> twey: i can't find a good forum
11:25:38 <kosmikus> Grizzly`: the tricky situation here is that syb was contained in base-3, but is a separate library since base-4
11:25:42 <Grizzly`> ahh... that's quite smart.
11:25:51 <Grizzly`> okay, i see.
11:26:00 <Grizzly`> so it's just that nobody noticed yet?
11:26:07 <SamB_irssi> rwbarton: you mean modules
11:26:12 <SamB_irssi> ?
11:26:18 <SamB_irssi> oh, no, you do mean packages
11:26:51 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: I don't know what the problem is exactly, I just did "cabal install type-level --reinstall" and it went smoothly
11:27:24 <kosmikus> yes, "cabal install" usually is more intelligent. I don't know why it failed for you.
11:27:30 <multiholle> does anybody use gtk2hs?
11:27:39 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: the most likely explanation is your version of Cabal is too old.  I don't know exactly how old "too old" is.
11:27:42 * mmorrow loves the gcc labels-as-values thing
11:27:44 <cjb> multiholle: yes, lots of people do
11:27:48 <jeffersonheard> multiholle, yes.  tons of people use gtk2hs
11:27:49 <koeien> multiholle: several people use it
11:27:50 <ehird> What structure should I use for a 2-dimensional, infinite grid? (from -inf,-inf to inf,inf)
11:27:52 <Badger> heh
11:28:03 <Grizzly`> I *think* that there seem to be general problems with consistency in the archlinux haskell packages
11:28:09 <Badger> "compilation is NOT required"
11:28:21 <doserj> Grizzly`: what version of cabal-install?
11:28:21 <jeffersonheard> btw, for people who tried my hieroglyph library, there's about to be a new release that rethinks the interface considerably
11:28:23 <multiholle> could somebody take a look at this: man-at-arms.de/risk_0_7_0.zip
11:28:25 <Grizzly`> I am considering uninstalling ALL of them and reinstalling everything anew with cabal-install
11:28:33 <jeffersonheard> cairo is about to be more functional
11:28:43 <jeffersonheard> thanks to conal
11:28:51 <conal> :)
11:28:58 * conal loves functional 
11:29:03 <Grizzly`> cabal-install 0.6.0, using cabal library 1.6.0.1
11:29:04 <dcoutts_> jeffersonheard: great, it's been crying out for a functional layer for ever
11:29:11 * conal loves denotational 
11:29:18 <Twey> Well, conal is awesome generally :-P
11:29:31 <conal> :)
11:29:34 * Twey sycophants.
11:29:41 <kosmikus> conal: you also had some lhs2TeX questions last night (night referring to my timezone)?
11:30:14 <conal> kosmikus: yeah.  i'm having trouble with some parameterized formatting i expected would be easy.
11:30:16 <ehird> anyone?
11:30:32 <kosmikus> conal: example?
11:30:51 <rwbarton> Grizzly`: those cabal versions should be fine
11:30:56 <conal> kosmikus: %format sqrt (u) = "\sqrt{" u "}"
11:31:07 <conal> kosmikus: i get http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=981#a981
11:31:33 <kosmikus> conal: looks good. how is it being used?
11:31:35 <conal> kosmikus: although i can't find a missing "}" in the generated latex.
11:31:39 <jeffersonheard> so what would the following function be called, based on its type signature?   (b -> b -> x) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> a -> x)
11:31:47 <vixey> :t on
11:31:48 <lambdabot> forall b c a. (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
11:31:59 <rwbarton> @hoogle (b -> b -> x) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> a -> x)
11:31:59 <lambdabot> Data.Function on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
11:32:00 <lambdabot> Data.Generics.Basics gmapQr :: Data a => (r' -> r -> r) -> r -> (a -> r') -> a -> r
11:32:00 <lambdabot> Data.Generics.Basics gmapQl :: Data a => (r -> r' -> r) -> r -> (a -> r') -> a -> r
11:32:23 <jeffersonheard> rwbarton, thanks
11:32:25 <dcoutts_> rwbarton, Grizzly`: cabal install --dry-run -v  can often give some insight into those kinds of problems. If you notice weirdness, look in the ghc-pkg list for cases where the same package version is in the global and user db.
11:32:28 <conal> kosmikus: things like this: d (asin u) ==  d u / (sqrt (1 - sqr u))
11:32:29 <jeffersonheard> thought it had to have been written somewhere
11:32:55 <rwbarton> conal: I think the problem is that you're trying to use \sqrt outside of math mode
11:33:07 <kosmikus> conal: that looks good as well. are you sure this is the line the error is in?
11:33:19 <multiholle> could somebody who uses gtk2hs take alook at my game? http://www.man-at-arms.de/risk_0_7_0.zip
11:33:20 <conal> kosmikus: of course inside of \begin{code} ... \end{code}.
11:33:32 <Badger> dcoutts_: well, the executable didn't retain Hidden either.
11:33:38 <conal> kosmikus: i'll pare my example way down to make sure it's not something else.
11:34:06 <ehird> Aww...You can't feed Map.fromList an infinite list.
11:34:15 <conal> ehird: yeah :(
11:34:19 <jeffersonheard> ehird: head strict
11:34:21 <kosmikus> conal: do you have something like "sqrt (foo  bar)"? i.e., with an alignment change in the middle of the argument?
11:34:21 <dcoutts_> Badger: I don't mind loosing attributes, in fact it's probably a good thing to loose them. The question really is if .exes built and installed as admin end up being readable/executable for all other users.
11:34:24 <jeffersonheard> is ouchy
11:34:26 <ehird> shame :-(
11:34:29 <mmorrow> weeeeee http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=997#a997
11:34:33 <conal> kosmikus: could be.
11:34:43 <ehird> mmorrow: old :P
11:34:48 <jeffersonheard> someone insane wrote a lazy infinite map some time back
11:34:51 <conal> kosmikus: i don't think so, however.  i'll know better soon.
11:34:52 <jeffersonheard> I remember it being on the list
11:34:55 <mmorrow> ehird: i can't get over it!
11:35:01 <ehird> jeffersonheard: True patriots!
11:35:04 <kosmikus> conal: because that's tricky, unfortunately.
11:35:07 <dcoutts_> Badger: btw, thanks very much for helping me with this. I've no access to vista and this is a knotty problem.
11:35:13 <Badger> dcoutts_: if only I had other users to test as. :/
11:35:19 <Badger> hmm
11:35:21 * Badger makes one.
11:35:27 <multiholle> nobody can help?
11:35:35 <Badger> ah
11:35:42 <dcoutts_> Badger: just checking the ACL should be enough to tell us, I think
11:35:45 <conal> kosmikus: should this work for exponents?  %format ^(b) = "^{" b "}"
11:36:11 <Badger> dcoutts_: my textfile had a perms section for all users, but the exe doesn't.
11:36:14 <dcoutts_> Badger: eg if there's an Everybody entry or just admin, creator-owner, etc
11:36:17 <kosmikus> conal: I'm afraid not.
11:36:31 <dcoutts_> Badger: ah, ok, interesting
11:36:32 <kosmikus> conal: %format EXP(b) = "^{" b "}"
11:36:36 <kosmikus> conal: that might work
11:36:40 <Badger> as for other execs
11:36:41 <Philonous> About STM: Isn't it sort of expensive to revert all the chances made in an "atomically" block? I mean after it would be possible that I have to revert it every time I try thus never complete the task,
11:36:46 <Philonous> changes*
11:36:49 <kosmikus> conal: operators are generally parsed in such a way that they don't get passed arguments
11:36:57 <Philonous> after all*
11:37:17 <conal> kosmikus: oh well.  thx.  i'll stop trying that one.
11:37:25 <Badger> oh, how strange
11:37:47 <kosmikus> conal: yes, it'd be nice if it worked.
11:37:49 <Badger> one I made earlier in gcc doesn't, but one that came from a cd does.
11:37:53 * Badger looks confused.
11:38:20 <dcoutts_> Badger: ok, so can we break this down, what were the permissions when the .txt and .exe were first created, and did using System.Directory.copyFile change the permissions at all in the copy
11:38:43 <rwbarton> conal: maybe as an experiment, change the rule to  %format sqrt (u) = "\sqrt{}" u ""
11:38:51 <multiholle> you said so many people use gtk2hs and nobody can help?
11:39:07 <dcoutts_> multiholle: try asking a more specific question
11:39:27 <cjb> multiholle: You need to.. write, ask a specific question.
11:39:31 <cjb> uh, s/write/right/
11:40:04 <conal> rwbarton: thx.
11:40:11 <multiholle> dcoutts_: it's the same problem as few hours ago.
11:40:30 <dcoutts_> Badger: can you tell me again what you mean about the .exe made with gcc compared to an .exe from a CD ?
11:41:01 <conal> kosmikus: when i isolate my problematic (i thought) code block (with sqrt), it formats perfectly.  there must be something else interfering.  now i can do a binary search for the problem.

11:44:07 <multiholle> cjb: isn't my question specific enough?
11:44:19 <cjb> multiholle: I still don't know what your question is.
11:44:36 <cjb> It apparently has something to do with a zip file, which I'm not going to download, because I don't want to write your code for you.
11:44:56 * CosmicRay commits -- hopefully -- HDBC 2.0 to git
11:44:56 <dcoutts_> Badger: so the .exe you compiled with gcc can be read/executed by admin but not by members of the Users group. Is that right?
11:45:00 <zachk> ehird: Data.Map (Integer,Integer) but that is from a few hours ago
11:45:08 <ehird> zachk: Hm?
11:45:14 <Badger> dcoutts_: I'll turn on the guest account and find out :)
11:45:38 <zachk> you wanted a 2d infinite grid, use a tuple of integers as keys to Data.Map
11:45:45 <dcoutts_> Badger: but that's what the permissions list would suggest, right?
11:45:57 <Badger> it appears so, but not certainly
11:45:58 <multiholle> cjb: i wrote 1000 lines of code. i don't want you to write my code. the problem is, that the program crashes when clicking on the surface of  the game, while a loop with threadDelay is running :/
11:46:01 <ehird> zachk: Right, 'swhat I'm doing.
11:46:05 <ehird> 19:41 <ehird> @hoogle [[a]] -> Map (Integer,Integer) a
11:46:08 <conal> kosmikus: oh!  i see the problem.  it's exactly what you said: "sqrt  x".
11:46:08 <ehird> :-P
11:47:12 <zachk> ehird >:E <- vampire face
11:47:19 <ehird> eek
11:47:23 <kosmikus> conal: can you work around that?
11:48:19 <multiholle> cjb: it's difficult to discribe the problem. so i packed the zip-file to show you the problem.
11:48:35 <Badger> ...
11:48:37 <conal> kosmikus: yes, easily.  :)
11:48:41 <cjb> multiholle: you should try harder to describe it, for example by reducing the problem to a small test-case.
11:48:51 <kosmikus> conal: good :)
11:49:04 <Badger> dcoutts_: sorry, but I can't test that, since it won't login to either the guest or a standard account that I make.
11:49:04 <rwbarton> multiholle: you don't really mean crashing, do you?  just it stops responding to input (perhaps temporarily)
11:49:12 <Badger> :/
11:49:25 <multiholle> rwbarton: that's right
11:49:33 <cjb> oh, huh
11:49:39 <dcoutts_> Badger: no probs, we can believe the permissions list
11:49:46 <CosmicRay> hrmph!
11:49:55 <CosmicRay> the Data.Time in hugs seems to not define ParseTime.
11:49:56 <rwbarton> multiholle: you shouldn't be using threadDelay but rather some gtk2hs timer mechanism
11:49:57 <conal> kosmikus: i think i found a bug last night.  \commentbegin isn't giving me any space after "{-".
11:49:58 <CosmicRay> how incredibly annoying.
11:50:14 <conal> kosmikus: i hacked around it with: \renewcommand{\commentbegin}{\enskip\{- }
11:50:26 <conal> kosmikus: that last space char was crucial.
11:50:29 <jeffersonheard> dcoutts_: is it possible in Cairo to run two threads in parallel rendering to two different surfaces, or is the Cairo state global?
11:50:38 <conal> kosmikus: i don't like my fix, as i presume it breaks \visiblecomments
11:51:01 <multiholle> rwbarton: what equivalent function exists in gtk2hs?
11:51:07 <rwbarton> multiholle: none
11:51:17 <rwbarton> multiholle: you want the gtk2hs loop to remain running
11:51:23 <kosmikus> conal: hm, so you're using "{-foo" without any space between the {- and the foo?
11:51:23 <rwbarton> multiholle: look at the Clock demo application
11:51:32 <conal> kosmikus: no.  i have the space.
11:51:51 <dcoutts_> jeffersonheard: check the cairo website, my guess is that separate surfaces are ok so long as it's ok for the underlying system, which for gtk surfaces it is not, unless you use the gdk lock.
11:51:58 <jeffersonheard> multiholle, what do you want your clicks on the surface to do?
11:52:08 <conal> kosmikus: for instance, in a code block:   == {- |fmap| on functions -}
11:52:13 <jeffersonheard> dcoutts_ thanks.
11:52:16 <icqn> tab key does not work the same way in windows as in *nix...

11:52:43 <lambdabot> Source not found. Your mind just hasn't been the same since the electro-shock, has it?
11:52:55 <rwbarton> jeffersonheard: it's calling threadDelay
11:53:11 <multiholle> jeffersonheard: the clicks on the surface should do nothing. but the game freeze when i do so.
11:53:17 <kosmikus> conal: you're right. that's not nice.

11:54:48 <kosmikus> conal: the propert fix is to redefine \commentbeginchars rather than \commentbegin
11:55:02 <kosmikus> conal: that'd not break \visiblecomments etc.
11:55:18 <conal> kosmikus: yeah.  i wanted to do it that way, but i guess i ran afoul of lexical scoping (?)
11:55:41 <conal> kosmikus: since i changed \commentbeginchars in my own .fmt file
11:55:46 <conal> kosmikus: and got no visible change.

11:57:39 <kosmikus> conal: lexical scoping? in LaTeX? ;)
11:58:15 <CosmicRay> conal: how could you
11:58:21 <conal> like i said, "way off"" ;)
11:58:40 <kosmikus> conal: I must say that I'm a bit surprised that nobody else ever complained about this bug
11:58:58 <icqn> Is there function completion command/key available in ghci on windows?
11:59:07 <conal> kosmikus: me too.  do haskell nestable comments *ever* look right?
11:59:15 <kosmikus> conal: it must have been there forever. I basically never use {- -} comments except with \invisiblecomments.
11:59:33 <kosmikus> conal: apparently nearly everyone else does the same.
11:59:54 <Badger> dcoutts_: one moment whilst I try to fiddle with advanced permissions without denying myself the ability to move the file. :P
12:00:09 <conal> kosmikus: oh!  i never wanted to use it before, but here i'm doing a program calculation
12:00:15 <rwbarton> writing in lhs takes away most of the use cases for {- -} I guess
12:00:15 <dcoutts_> Badger: heh heh. I'll be back shortly as dcoutts
12:00:35 <ksf> conal, i've got another reactive bug for you.
12:00:40 <conal> kosmikus: your suggested local fix (commentbeginchars & visiblecomments) woks.
12:00:48 <conal> ksf: great.  what's it like?
12:00:48 <kosmikus> conal: but the calculation people usually use \{ ... \} (without the -'s)
12:00:55 <ksf> ...or possibly just another incarnation of it's only one
12:00:59 <ksf> http://moonpatio.com:8080/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=977
12:01:17 <ksf> the rhs of <|> push-lags more than its lhs.
12:01:25 <conal> kosmikus: oh!!  i hadn't noticed.  i wonder why.  hm.  aren't they in math mode then?
12:01:55 <conal> ksf: oops!  would you please make a trac ticket?
12:01:56 <kosmikus> conal: what does it have to do with math mode?
12:01:58 <SamB_irssi> would that GenericT' be valid in H98 (assuming there was a data class ?)
12:02:27 <ksf> what might be interesting is that those Events are fed by two different sinks running in two different forkIO's.
12:02:46 <conal> kosmikus: i figured i wouldn't want to start in math mode in my calculation comment.  and that {- ... -} would put me in text/comment (?) mode.
12:02:56 <kosmikus> conal: I just think that they write { arithmetic } rather than {- arithmetic -}
12:02:57 <conal> kosmikus: while \{ ... \} would start in math mode.
12:03:29 <ksf> I gave up on binding to agar in favour of working directly with xhb, which gives me all events in one thread, so I'm not sure whether I will observe it again.
12:03:44 <kosmikus> conal: no, I was saying that when I'm typesetting a calculation with lhs2TeX, I'm typically using \calculationcomments for a suitably defined definition of that command ;)
12:03:50 <ksf> I'm gonna keep the code around though (of course)
12:03:52 <Badger> dcoutts: the previously set special permission denying deletion vanished during copyFile.
12:04:02 <SamB_irssi> oh, no, it doesn't seem to be ...
12:04:03 <Badger> (to Program Files)
12:04:23 <conal> kosmikus: \calculationcomments ?  maybe something i've missed.
12:04:35 <Badger> so if you don't mind default permissions then it's good :P
12:04:59 <conal> kosmikus: do you have some example source you could share?
12:05:10 <kosmikus> conal: I'm looking
12:05:41 <Badger> dcoutts: but I guess you'll need to grab somebody to test whether standard users can execute them.
12:06:33 <ksf> gosh trac is trac sluggish.
12:06:39 <ksf> s/trac//
12:07:04 <conal> ksf: external event gathering has always been the dodgiest aspect of Reactive.  i keep thinking there's an simple & clearly correct formulation.  haven't found it yet.
12:07:26 <conal> ksf: as i think you've noticed ;)
12:07:47 <ksf> occasionally, yes ;)
12:08:15 <ksf> I've also been thinking about reactive feedback.
12:09:44 <CosmicRay> time to break out cpphs due to yet another hugs annoyance
12:09:51 <ksf> If you've got an adapter that adapts functions like (Event World -> Event World), does it make sense to tie the knot inside reactive and avoid going via IO/legacy sinks?
12:10:05 <ksf> I might have missed some feature of the api, though.
12:10:43 <kosmikus> conal: http://www.cs.uu.nl/~andres/Calculation.lhs
12:11:28 <ksf> actually, the example is bad. the case that made me think of it was changing the function that maps keycodes to chars from both outside and inside the pure function.
12:12:00 <beelsebob> you can tell it's ICFP season, can't you
12:12:00 <conal> kosmikus: i like it!  hadn't thought of messing with the comment style in this way.  thanks :)
12:12:02 <beelsebob> :)
12:12:22 <conal> beelsebob: indeed :)
12:12:29 <vixey> how do you learn LaTeX?
12:12:42 <beelsebob> vixey: with difficulty – it's a bloody horrible language
12:13:17 <conal> ksf: i like the sound of what you're saying.  struggling to internalize it.  What's "World"?
12:14:59 <ksf> conal, I don't know yet. Something like reactive-glut's UI on steroids on the input side, and something like Behaviour [Behaviour Window] or such on the output side.
12:15:18 <ksf> all I know is that it'll be quite complex.
12:15:51 <ozy`> I can't wait to say hello to World
12:17:02 <beelsebob> ksf: interesting – is there a reason you chose Behavior [Behavior Window] over Behavior [Window]?  (note, not saying its wrong, I actually see significant advantage, but I'm interested in why you chose it)
12:17:05 <conal> ksf: have you read "Genuinely functional user interfaces"? (http://www.apocalypse.org/pub/u/antony/work/pubs/genuinely-functional-guis.pdf)
12:17:25 <ksf> for now, I'm just going to pay attention to protect the pure function to know too much about the fixpoint it's caught in.
12:18:17 <conal> ksf: i want to move toward interaction (including UIs) that are semantically well-founded.  that's what the "genuinely" paper points to.
12:18:40 * ksf tries to reconstruct his thought
12:19:02 <conal> ksf: i expect a semantically-based GUI framework would be much more powerful and composable than any we've seen.
12:19:11 <CosmicRay> is there any way to determine whether a Haskell program is executing under ghc or hugs at runtime, without using cpphs?
12:19:30 <ksf> ah, sure, you've got a different amount of windows, each of which has their own behaviour.
12:19:59 <gwern> @seen roconnor hey, check out the IEM email - CC ftl!
12:19:59 <lambdabot> roconnor is in ##logic and #haskell. I last heard roconnor speak 2h 7m 1s ago.

12:20:03 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
12:20:05 <andyjgill> Does anyone know of an easy way to print/debug the type of a specific argument of a polymorphic function? unsafePrintType?
12:20:09 <osfameron> what's the new Split module on hackage called?
12:20:12 <chrisdone> is it possible to catch all possible exceptions from the IO monad?
12:20:26 <gwern> osfameron: 'split' last I heard
12:20:33 <conal> andyjgill: willing to add a Typeable constraint ?
12:20:42 <osfameron> just "Split" ?  Not Data.Split or List.Split or anything?
12:20:43 <ksf> I usually don't carefully design my types on irc, though.
12:20:43 <chrisdone> osfameron: the haskell module is Data.List.Split
12:20:47 <osfameron> aha
12:20:49 <vixey> andyjgill, make  instance What Int where what = "Int" ...

12:21:26 <ksf> conal, I've read about fruit, but don't know if it was that paper.
12:21:33 <conal> andyjgill: i mean about (show . typeof) x
12:21:34 <vixey> hm well,  what _ = "Int" I gues it should have been
12:21:43 <conal> ksf: probably
12:21:47 <pumpkin> I said what what
12:23:38 <osfameron> gwern, chrisdone: ok so it's http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/split ?  But "cabal install split" tells me there's no such package and "cabal install Data.List.Split" gives me "Failed to parse package dependency: "Data.List.Split"
12:23:40 <chrisdone> can Control.Exception.catch be used polymorphically? I want to catch any exception, and I'm using `toException' in my code but getting Ambiguous type variable `e' in the constraint: `Exception e'
12:23:48 <chrisdone> osfameron: try cabal update
12:23:54 <gwern> darn, chrisdone beat me
12:24:02 <osfameron> ah!  that isn't automatic, gotcha
12:24:06 <gwern> nope
12:24:11 <gwern> I have it in a cron job tho
12:24:25 <osfameron> I was expecting similar usage to cpan :-)
12:24:51 <gwern> hm, I think it's been discussed once or twice to make cabal install call cabal update in the background, but the problem is apparently that'd be very wasteful
12:24:54 <osfameron> meh, Data/List/Split/Internals.hs:1:13: cannot parse LANGUAGE pragma

12:26:45 <rwbarton> osfameron: :O
12:26:47 <osfameron> ah, the module says "Built on" 6.10
12:27:44 <osfameron> does that mean it's the minimum version?
12:28:14 <rwbarton> osfameron: it should work under 6.8.2 probably.  It needs GADTs and Rank2Types
12:29:05 <chrisdone> rwbarton: if I use `IO a -> (SomeException -> IO a) -> IO' does that refer to an instance of Exception for which the catch procedure will catch any kind of exception and give it me wrapped up in SomeException?
12:29:08 <SamB_irssi> any idea why pattern signatures was deprecated ?
12:29:11 <osfameron> I always get depressed when a module to do something as simple as splitting a string requires extensions I don't understand :-)
12:29:14 <SamB_irssi> that is...
12:29:16 <rwbarton> chrisdone: Yes, that's my understanding
12:29:19 <SamB_irssi> PatternSignatures
12:30:11 <chrisdone> rwbarton: thanks. I'd looked at SomeException but I guess I had a brain fart and though that specifying a concrete type for `catch' would make it not polymorphic, hehe
12:30:12 <stepcut> why is haskell-mode cd'ing to ~/.cabal even though I have .cabal file in my project directory :(
12:30:16 * osfameron will compile a newer ghc overnight.  Does it still take forever to compile?
12:30:19 <Grizzly`> my goodness, it's been almost an hour now! how can building gtk2hs take longer than building gtk2 itself!
12:30:57 <gwern> stepcut: because emacs haskell-mode is not particularly good
12:30:57 <chrisdone> stepcut: is the .cabal file the same name as the directory name in which it is placed? I vaguely recall that's necessary
12:31:04 <gwern> stepcut: yi has that fixed btw
12:31:05 <stepcut> ugh
12:32:11 <stepcut> chrisdone: thanks, that fixed it
12:33:03 <true\false> When I define some implementation when defining a typeclass .. I assume that's a sort of 'default' implementation?

12:33:30 <CosmicRay> Grizzly`: what platform?
12:34:01 <Grizzly`> CosmicRay, x86-64.
12:34:06 <true\false> Ah nice, explains the cross-referencing :)
12:34:12 <CosmicRay> Grizzly`: what os?
12:34:13 <Grizzly`> it finished just now
12:34:17 <kosmikus> mattam: how was your talk?
12:34:20 <chrisdone> stepcut: welcome
12:34:21 <zachk> man breeding sheep is hard work D:
12:34:30 <Grizzly`> linux. 2.6.28.1 or something.
12:35:04 <CosmicRay> did you compile ghc yourself or get it from a distro?
12:35:15 <mattam> kosmikus: good! Which one?
12:35:17 <Grizzly`> archlinux package.
12:35:22 <Grizzly`> 6.10.1
12:35:41 <CosmicRay> ah.  guess it's just slow then.  was trying to see if you had an unregisterized ghc.
12:35:56 <kosmikus> mattam: didn't know you had so many ;) the Nijmegen one was the one I was thus thinking about.
12:36:04 <Grizzly`> rigisterized meaning what?
12:36:20 <mattam> Oh right. It was great.
12:36:41 <kosmikus> mattam: do you have slides?

12:37:03 <pumpkin> has anyone used the protocol buffers package on hackage?
12:37:18 <mattam> If didn't make the association with your nick. We know each other from gentoo actually :)
12:37:43 <BrokenClockwork> > "Lambdabot, tell me what has to be imported for the (!)-command"
12:37:45 <lambdabot>   "Lambdabot, tell me what has to be imported for the (!)-command"
12:37:46 <kosmikus> mattam: yes, I guess that's true :)
12:38:28 <mattam> kosmikus: yes, on my website. But it seems down ATM.
12:38:34 <kosmikus> mattam: but it's also long ago ...
12:38:49 <kosmikus> mattam: ok, I'll look later
12:38:56 <rwbarton> @hoogle (!)
12:38:57 <lambdabot> keyword !
12:38:57 <lambdabot> Data.IntMap (!) :: IntMap a -> Key -> a
12:38:57 <lambdabot> Data.Map (!) :: Ord k => Map k a -> k -> a
12:38:58 <mattam> Oh yes... my pre-Coq days.
12:39:09 <kosmikus> hehe

12:39:12 <lambdabot> Data.Array.IArray array :: (IArray a e, Ix i) => (i, i) -> [(i, e)] -> a i e
12:39:23 <BrokenClockwork> data array does it as well, huh?
12:39:26 <BrokenClockwork> :)
12:39:27 <rwbarton> BrokenClockwork: Data.Array.IArray, if you want the array one
12:39:32 <dcoutts> gwern: we could do make it call update, but not synchronously
12:39:41 <BrokenClockwork> thanks
12:39:45 <gwern> dcoutts: hence the background part
12:40:09 <dcoutts> gwern: I mean we could have it check if there is anything new, but not download it, instead say there are updates, but there are always updates so I'm not sure that helps.
12:40:19 <gwern> but it'd be kind of wasteful to do it on each cabal install... I know I often run cabal install a couple times at once
12:40:22 <dcoutts> gwern: we'd need to implement incremental updates for it to be useful.
12:40:28 <pumpkin> @seen dons
12:40:28 <lambdabot> dons is in #concatenative, #arch-haskell, #darcs, #xmonad, #ghc and #haskell. I don't know when dons last spoke.
12:40:42 <dcoutts> gwern: and only when we're going to the network for other reasons anyway
12:41:07 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: kure-your-boilerplate 0.1.3
12:41:14 * kosmikus wonders what #concatenative is about
12:41:21 <gwern> dcoutts: so supose I run cabal update twice in a row - the second one redoes all the work of the first?
12:41:24 <gnuvince> kosmikus: concatenative languages
12:41:27 <gwern> kosmikus: factor, in practice
12:41:37 <kosmikus> and that is?
12:42:00 <gwern> a langage
12:42:05 <rwbarton> kosmikus: languages like forth or postscript
12:42:10 <gwern> or an obssessive programmer named slava
12:42:25 <kosmikus> as in factorcode.org ?
12:42:32 <dcoutts> gwern: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/428
12:42:33 <int80_h> whoever heard of an obsessive programmer
12:43:31 <gwern> int80_h: a contradiction in terms, I agree, but it conveys my meaning
12:44:01 <gwern> dcoutts: I didn't mean 'make the download more efficient', I meant 'don't download at all'
12:44:11 <int80_h> I was joking. It seems to me you have to be at least a little obsessive to get anything important done
12:44:32 <dcoutts> gwern: we can make it as cheap as a conditional get
12:44:53 <dcoutts> gwern: ie just a check if there is anything to do, one http request, but no data returned just a status
12:45:15 <dcoutts> gwern: I don't see how we can avoid going to the network at all when you do cabal update; cabal update
12:45:28 <dcoutts> gwern: I mean I can't see how we can avoid it the second time.
12:45:30 <gwern> yes, but that seems to be different from the bug report, which seems to be about how, if the tarball is modified, we can transfer deltas instead of the whole thing
12:45:35 <gwern> unless I misread it
12:46:01 <BrokenClockwork> There was a site in the internet about economical use of function programming?
12:46:07 <BrokenClockwork> was someone bookmarked it?
12:47:11 <vixey> what is economical programming ?
12:47:16 <gwern> economical? you mean SPJ's financial contracts DSL?
12:48:07 <BrokenClockwork> bah, damn, not economical programming, I mean programming for money, or economic use of functional programming
12:48:56 <olsner> *commercial :)
12:49:47 <BrokenClockwork> thanks :D
12:56:32 <djsiegel> Hey, I tried to cabal install a package and it told be that my base package version is too low: http://paste2.org/p/136998
12:56:38 <djsiegel> How can I check my base package version?
12:57:16 <mauke> ghc-pkg list base
12:57:17 <blackh> djsiegel: ghc-pkg list
12:57:36 <mauke> base-4 is basically ghc-6.10
12:57:51 <dcoutts> djsiegel: However the base version is tied to the ghc version (mostly) so you could try installing an older version of the package if older ones work with older version of base.
12:57:53 <blackh> djsiegel: Try an older version of the package.  A lot of the packages on Hackage have been updated to work on ghc-6.10 recently and some of them don't work on older versions of ghc.
12:58:17 <mauke> I don't think there's an older version of "filestore-0.1" :-)
12:58:40 <jeffersonheard> anyone know is Data.Foldable.foldlM creates space leaks?
12:58:45 <jeffersonheard> is it strict in its left parameter?
12:59:05 <djsiegel> blackh: Yes, I tried an older version and it worked, although when I started using the package, I realized the only documentation and examples I had were for the latest release.
13:00:46 <blackh> djsiegel: If you want to use base-4 you will have to use ghc-6.10.x
13:01:13 <djsiegel> Ok, thanks, blackh.
13:03:16 <augustss> @seen igloo
13:03:17 <lambdabot> igloo is in #darcs, #ghc and #haskell. I last heard igloo speak 6h 26m 33s ago.
13:03:43 <Igloo> augustss: Hi
13:04:19 <icqn> Is there function completion command/key available in ghci on windows?
13:04:43 <jeffersonheard> also.. is the following a valid and sane type signature?
13:04:51 <jeffersonheard> visualize :: Foldable t => t Primitive -> Render ()
13:05:06 <jeffersonheard> visualize d = renderPrimitives . sort . toList $ d
13:05:11 <drdozer> I've got a load of IO operations that run on independent files and data, which I am currently calling forM_ on
13:05:16 <drdozer> I don't care which order they run in
13:05:32 <drdozer> is there a quick (and dirty?) way to spawn of an OS thread to process each of these?
13:05:42 <drdozer> and then wait untill they are all completed?
13:05:59 <pumpkin> http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:8uOvmBRNR38J:hpaste.org/1492+cale+parmapm&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=safari
13:06:41 <doserj> jeffersonheard: do you really need Foldable? why not just [Primitive] -> Render ()?
13:06:43 <blackh> drdozer: MVars should work OK for that.
13:07:04 <pumpkin> drdozer: check out the parMapM in that paste I just put up
13:07:10 <blackh> drdozer: Haskell only has quick ways, not dirty ways. :)
13:07:11 <drdozer> hi again blackh :)
13:07:16 <Gracenotes> aha! Just as I expected, Debug.Trace unsafe performs IO >_<
13:07:19 <jeffersonheard> doserj, it makes sense in context, trust me.  long story
13:07:33 <pumpkin> Gracenotes: what did you expect? :P
13:07:36 <blackh> drdozer: Hello, nice to see ya!
13:07:49 <Gracenotes> er... for it to unsafe perform IO, I think
13:08:03 <doserj> jeffersonheard: ok then :)
13:08:09 <jeffersonheard> doserj: It makes my interface more composable in the context of throwing input data into the funtion
13:08:14 <pumpkin> it was more of a rhetorical question given that you'd said what you expected already :P
13:08:32 <drdozer> blackh: your xpickle code droped right in
13:08:39 <jeffersonheard> I don't really care about the structure of my input data, so much as I care that i can eventually turn it into a list of primitives, sort it, and render it
13:08:47 <BrokenClockwork1> sorry I was thrown out, did someone answered on my commercial use of haskell/functional programming question?
13:09:03 <drdozer> pumpkin: thanks - I will try that out
13:09:04 <blackh> drdozer: Great! I wrote it because I needed better performance and had a lot of picklers already written.

13:11:52 <int80_h> can someone help me with my nested where problem?

13:12:08 <int80_h> http://www.moonpatio.com:8080/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=998#a998
13:12:20 <drdozer> blackh: I made a handful of modifications
13:12:32 <rwbarton> int80_h: you can't give variables names beginning with capital letters
13:12:47 <djsiegel> blackh: I install GHC 6.10.1, but now I get http://paste2.org/p/137010
13:12:54 <int80_h> ahh, gotcha
13:12:59 <djsiegel> how do I "register at least one package in the user package db"?
13:13:46 <blackh> drdozer: That's good - please send them to me.
13:13:46 <mauke> but you don't seem to have ghc-6.9
13:14:20 <Tobsan> by the way int80_h you dont need to nest the second where
13:14:33 <int80_h> Tobsan : thanks :)
13:14:43 <Tobsan> you could remove it and put the others below crossProduct = ...
13:15:12 <int80_h> tobsan: doing it
13:15:19 <Tobsan> ok :)
13:16:09 <blackh> djsiegel: I don't know! You could delete everything from the old ghc install and that might fix it.
13:16:30 <augustss> int80_h: also, instead of arguments a b c you might want (x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3)
13:16:34 <djsiegel> blackh: ok, will try :)
13:16:49 <augustss> int80_h: and get rid of all the fst and snd
13:17:11 <int80_h> augustss: nice! okay I will
13:17:42 <thoughtpolice> augustss: with the llvm bindings if I use optimizeFunction in LLVM.Utils.
13:17:47 <thoughtpolice> er
13:17:59 <thoughtpolice> augustss: with the llvm bindings if I use optimizeFunction in LLVM.Utils.File, what can I do with the IO (Function a) result?
13:18:00 <augustss> yes?
13:18:32 <augustss> thoughtpolice: hang on...
13:23:19 <CyberGarp> anyone got hints on tracking down memory leaking in ghc....
13:23:23 <augustss> thoughtpolice: you can do runEngineAccess $ do addModuleProvider prov; generateFunction func
13:23:26 <Tobsan> @src cycle
13:23:26 <lambdabot> cycle [] = undefined
13:23:26 <lambdabot> cycle xs = xs' where xs' = xs ++ xs'
13:23:29 <CyberGarp> I'm thrashing here trying to figure it out.
13:23:38 <augustss> thoughtpolice: or you could use optimizeFunctionCG
13:23:45 <Tobsan> @src repeat
13:23:45 <lambdabot> repeat x = xs where xs = x : xs
13:23:51 <multiholle> i reduced my problem to a simple one. why freezes the program when clicking few times on the surface? http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=1000#a1000
13:24:24 <jeffersonheard> doserj: actually, now that I look at Foldable, I realize that no-one defines instances of it
13:24:27 <jeffersonheard> Which I find odd
13:24:42 <jeffersonheard> I would think that Data.Graph at the very least would define a Foldable
13:24:52 <hasMeta> Hey folks
13:25:02 <augustss> int80_h: btw, giving names to all those diff terms seems to be of little value
13:25:04 <hasMeta> could somebody help out with "Maybe" -> http://rafb.net/p/aAkC4i31.html ? Please
13:25:55 <hasMeta> how do I tell haskell to "wrap" the string with maybe
13:26:03 <rwbarton> hasMeta: I don't know what your question is but you probably want putStrLn (a ++ b) first of all
13:26:23 <loadquo> multiholle: Does Draw need to be recursive?
13:26:35 <mauke> hasMeta: (Just x)
13:27:20 <multiholle> loadquo: in the real program its the part of the atrificial itelligence player. eache loop is a turn.
13:27:26 <hasMeta> line 28, the compiler is looking for "Maybe String" rather than "String"
13:27:41 <hasMeta> line 12, sorry
13:28:02 <rwbarton> multiholle: I don't know what you're expecting here.
13:28:18 <rwbarton> multiholle: the "draw" loop will run forever
13:28:42 <multiholle> rwbarton: that's right. wait, i'll correct.
13:28:48 <loadquo> And you are setting up an infinite loop each time you click...
13:28:51 <rwbarton> multiholle: your whole program is running in one thread which threadDelay pauses
13:29:52 <drdozer> @src mapM_
13:29:52 <lambdabot> mapM_ f as = sequence_ (map f as)
13:30:02 <drdozer> @src sequence_
13:30:02 <lambdabot> sequence_ ms = foldr (>>) (return ()) ms
13:31:17 <multiholle> the real program looks more like this:  http://moonpatio.com/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=1001#a1001
13:31:33 <Gracenotes> sequence_ could also be foldr1 (>>), right?
13:31:44 <multiholle> i don't wan't to start a new draw function while the old one is running.
13:32:18 <vixey> how do I do this
13:32:23 <thoughtpolice> augustss: ty

13:33:47 <Gracenotes> vixey: foo can't really be a -> b -> a unless, given an a and a b, it returns an a... I'd think

13:34:23 <vixey> @let foo :: a -> b -> a; foo = foo
13:34:25 <lambdabot>  Defined.
13:34:30 <vixey> great!

13:34:39 <lambdabot>        arising from a use ...
13:34:48 <pumpkin>     No instance for (IArray DiffUArray a)
13:34:52 <pumpkin> anyone know where I can find that instance?
13:35:28 <rwbarton> multiholle: that will stop the gtk event loop for 20 seconds while your program is in draw
13:35:32 <Gracenotes> rwbarton: huh. is that because _|_ is a "superset" of all other types?
13:35:54 <multiholle> rwbarton: what can i do against it?
13:36:03 <rwbarton> Gracenotes: more precisely every type has a value _|_
13:36:14 <rwbarton> multiholle: use gtk timers
13:36:23 <rwbarton> multiholle: although you haven't said the exact behavior you want
13:36:52 <rwbarton> multiholle: whatever you do, don't use threadDelay
13:37:23 <multiholle> the behavior is similiar to the example. i want to calculate some things and then to draw them.
13:37:46 <multiholle> aren't timers for animations?
13:37:59 * rwbarton is so confused
13:38:15 <rwbarton> what are you trying to use threadDelay for if not animation?
13:38:23 <pumpkin> bah, damn orphan instance :(
13:38:34 <rwbarton> obviously deleting all occurrences of threadDelay will fix this problem
13:39:16 <Philonous> Has System.Cmd been removed in ghc 6.10?
13:39:39 <multiholle> a timer generates static signal
13:39:52 <multiholle> what i need is a break for x seconds
13:39:57 <multiholle> it variates
13:40:57 <multiholle> a timer is used by the clock demo, right?

13:45:41 <multiholle> how would you program this: roll a dice >> show the dice for 2 seconds >> set figurine >> wait 1 second >> switch to next player

13:47:24 <zloog> Hrm, anyone know why http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html#v%3Arights shows there is a function called rights, but neither my ghc nor lambdabot knows it?
13:47:30 <multiholle> a click on the surface on a specific place
13:47:44 <cads> Hey you guys, check this out: monadic code in ruby. Apparently the roll3d6(m) method takes one of three monads to calculate various statistics about rolling three six sided dice.
13:47:51 <cads> http://pastie.org/372573
13:48:21 <rwbarton> zloog: probably has to do with that "latest" in the URL :)
13:48:41 <rwbarton> multiholle: what happens if you click there during the 2 second pause?
13:48:49 <rwbarton> multiholle: basically you need to implement it yourself using timers
13:48:55 <multiholle> nothing
13:49:08 <cads> this has been floating around my computer for a while titled "warm_fuzzy_simulations.rb", which I think is the reference to the quote "the biggest mistake we made with haskell that scared people away was calling them monads, instead of 'warm fuzzy thing'"
13:49:21 <multiholle> nothing happens until the next player clicks
13:49:34 <multiholle> but how to realize the pause?
13:50:06 <jvoorhis> cads: that's the reference, and here's the article: http://eigenclass.org/hiki/warm-fuzzy-things-for-random-simulations
13:50:40 <rwbarton> multiholle: um, using a timer?  I don't understand what the problem is here
13:50:45 <pumpkin> hprotoc isn't working for me, has anyone used it?
13:50:46 <cads> yeah, I just found the file the other day, I've been trying to re-find that article for literally year
13:50:52 <cads> a year*
13:50:59 <rwbarton> multiholle: when the surface is clicked, disable the click callback and start a timer

13:51:12 <cads> jvoorhis: are you at all a rubyist?
13:51:17 <rwbarton> multiholle: when the timer elapses, "set figurine"
13:51:22 <rwbarton> multiholle: set another timer, etc.

13:52:48 <Guenni> in all about monads http://www.haskell.org/all_about_monads/html/identitymonad.html I so don't understand the definition of (>>=) how can that be?
13:53:21 <ski_> @src Identity (>>=)
13:53:21 <lambdabot> m >>= k  = k (runIdentity m)
13:53:23 <cads> jvoorhis: what do you think about that style of encapsulating a monad in a ruby class? I for one culdn't read it when i last saw it a year ago, but now I recognize the bind and  lift
13:53:46 <ski_> Guenni : that one ?
13:53:55 <Guenni> ski_: thx, but that's not how it's on the page
13:54:05 <dolio> Well, that's clearly the wrong definition. :)
13:54:14 <mauke> (Identity x) >>= f = f x
13:54:21 <mauke> same thing, since m = Identity x
13:54:22 <Guenni> dobblego: ok so it *is* a typo
13:54:23 <dolio> Much better.
13:54:28 <Guenni> ?
13:54:32 <jvoorhis> cads: i don't know of a better way to go about it
13:54:36 <dolio> Oh, I guess it doesn't matter, since Identity is a newtype.
13:54:48 <ski_> Guenni : the two definitions are equivalent
13:54:57 <zloog> rwbarton: Thanks I'll try to go upgrade. Seems odd it would have taken that long for such a function to hit the standard libs though.
13:55:07 <ski_> Guenni : now, what about it did you not understand ?
13:55:12 <int80_h> @src compare
13:55:12 <lambdabot> compare x y | x == y    = EQ
13:55:12 <lambdabot>             | x <= y    = LT
13:55:12 <lambdabot>             | otherwise = GT
13:55:16 <rwbarton> , [$ty| rights |]
13:55:18 <icqn> What does  this mean "seq = ...       -- Primitive" is it written/implemented in another language?
13:55:19 <lunabot>  forall a b . [] (Either b a) -> [] a
13:55:38 <ski_> icqn : yes
13:55:48 <icqn> ski_, in c?
13:55:53 <jvoorhis> cads: any non-haskell language with monad support either relies on macros, a pre-processor, or makes you deal with your lambdas
13:56:00 <Guenni> ski_: the definition in all about monads
13:56:02 <ski_> icqn : in whatever you compile into
13:56:03 <icqn> ...talking about ghc
13:56:04 <rwbarton> zloog: It's easier to write it yourself than to upgrade.  rights xs = [ y | Right y <- xs ]
13:56:17 <mauke> Guenni: WHAT ABOUT IT
13:56:29 <cads> jvoorhis: now that I can understand a shadow of monads in haskell, it's interesting to think of chains of >>= being implemented as nested blocks in ruby... yeah, essentially they are lambdas
13:56:30 <multiholle> does anybody knows an example/tutorial on how to use timers?
13:56:33 <dolio> icqn: It's actually expressible (I think) in the core intermediate language that GHC uses.
13:56:38 <dolio> But not in Haskell proper.
13:56:50 <zloog> rwbarton: Exactly what i just did :-)
13:57:01 <Guenni> how can (Identity x) >>= f = fx by identical to (Identity x) >>= f = Idenditity (f x)?
13:57:17 <ski_> (dolio : something like `seq !x y = y' ?)
13:57:18 <rwbarton> icqn: You can implement it for many specific types a in Haskell.
13:57:24 <dolio> seq x y = case x of { z -> y }
13:57:28 <Riastradh> With a serious typing impediment, Guenni.
13:57:33 <pumpkin> lol
13:57:42 <mauke> Guenni: huh?
13:57:42 <dolio> ski_: Since case always evaluates to whnf in core.
13:57:45 <rwbarton> icqn: e.g. seq :: Bool -> a -> a ; seq b x = case b of False -> x; True -> x
13:57:56 <mauke> Guenni: where did you get that second version from?
13:58:11 <jvoorhis> cads: yeah, the only real strength of do-notation, as far as i see it, is that it flattens the *appearance* of the nested structure
13:58:27 <icqn> in what language is GHC written?
13:58:31 <rwbarton> icqn: seq is only deeply magical on function types, I think.
13:58:34 <pumpkin> in ghc haskell
13:58:36 <Guenni> from http://www.haskell.org/all_about_monads/html/identitymonad.html
13:58:46 <mauke> Guenni: no, you didn't
13:58:55 <rwbarton> Yes, it is there in the summary
13:58:59 <mauke> Guenni: oh, wait, found it
13:59:13 <multiholle> rwbarton: google can't find a example/guide/tutorial on how to use timers :/
13:59:17 <glguy> ski_, I called it suspend because that's how I think about what is happening
13:59:24 <glguy> the current computation is caputured into k
13:59:27 <glguy> completely
13:59:29 <icqn> sk_, rwbarton, dolio, thanks
13:59:29 <mauke> Guenni: yes, the definition in "Binding strategy" is wrong. the one below in "Definition" is the right one
13:59:36 <glguy> never to resume unless you manually do so
13:59:36 <augustss> icqn: now you are supposed to ask how the first ghc was compiled ;)
14:00:07 <icqn> augustss, ok, this way :-)
14:00:09 <pumpkin> the first ghc was compiled with a time machine
14:00:22 <cads> jvoorhis: I wonder if anyone's done a similar syntax in ruby as a magical ruby DSL
14:00:22 <Guenni> mauke: sure, not the other way around?
14:00:23 <rwbarton> the first ghc was compiled using mfix
14:00:32 <thetallgu1>  I'm looking at Uniplate and I see the recommendation to use UniplateStr, but no explanation.  Is there a discussion of this choice somewhere?
14:00:36 <augustss> icqn: it was compiled using hbc (no matter what the History of Haskell paper claims)
14:00:42 <dolio> glguy: I think it's usually called C or control in The Literature (although it's not the delimited 'control' obviously).
14:00:44 <mauke> Guenni: er, just look at the types
14:01:04 <jvoorhis> cads: http://github.com/aanand/ruby-do-notation/tree/master
14:01:09 <glguy> dolio, yes, I've seen "C"
14:01:16 <jvoorhis> cads: imho, the implementation is an abomination :)
14:01:17 <glguy> dolio, but that won't really do for a library function
14:01:26 <dolio> Yeah.
14:02:01 <dmead>  hey guys
14:02:04 <dmead> can ghc target arm?
14:02:11 <dmead> arm 8 specifically?
14:02:22 <cads> jvoorhis: but then, it'd have to be :D
14:02:25 <Guenni> mauke: so (Identity 12) >>= (+3) should be 15, right?
14:02:41 <glguy> dolio, I've got the unlabeled, delimited continuations ready for monadlib
14:02:43 <mauke> Guenni: no
14:02:48 <icqn> augustss, ok, thank you for information
14:02:49 <glguy> dolio, so you can't pick a reset to shift to
14:02:53 <ski_> dolio : i think i've seen it called `notNotE' .. though i might be imagining things
14:02:55 <mauke> Guenni: that should be a type error
14:02:56 <glguy> but you can at least do some of it
14:03:00 <thetallgu1> dmead: stepcut did a non-registerized port to the Nokia 8xx a few years ago
14:03:18 <dolio> ski_: Heh, I'm not sure that's a great name, either.
14:03:24 <Guenni> mauke: correct it is, but why?
14:03:24 <dmead> thetallgu1, a port? or he just bootstrapped it on arm?
14:03:31 <dmead> or make a cross compiler
14:03:33 <ski_> @type (Identity (12 :: Int)) >>= (+3)
14:03:34 <lambdabot>     Couldn't match expected type `Identity b'
14:03:34 <lambdabot>            against inferred type `Int'
14:03:34 <lambdabot>     In the second argument of `(>>=)', namely `(+ 3)'
14:03:45 <glguy> "captureCC" doesn't seem like a terrible name
14:03:46 <mauke> Guenni: wtf. because Int /= Identity Int
14:03:53 <dolio> glguy: I wouldn't worry about that too much. I think the only time I've actually seen it used was in Oleg's dynamically scoped variables thing.
14:03:54 <ski_> (dolio : `E' for `Elimination')
14:03:58 <thetallgu1> dmead: I forget now, but I think he just did the bootstrap
14:04:07 <dmead> cool
14:04:30 <yitz> dmead: search the ghc and cafe lists, a group of people were working on it not that long ago.
14:04:34 <thetallgu1> dmead: There was another group that was interested more recently.  Don't know how far they got.
14:04:46 <yitz> dmead: they put it on hold because they were waiting for a certain ghc release
14:04:47 <dmead> rog
14:04:50 <dmead> ah
14:05:04 <drdozer> mm, I've tried that parMapM code but it doesn't seem to be forking
14:05:09 <dcoutts> @seen Toxaris
14:05:09 <lambdabot> I saw Toxaris leaving #haskell 2h 2m 19s ago, and .
14:05:12 <yitz> dmead: which has already come out (6.10, I think)
14:05:19 <Guenni> mauke: I though the (>>=) peels it out of (Identity) and passes it to (+3) as an Integer, that's how I interpret the definition of (>>=) in the identity monad
14:05:27 <CyberGarp> I've gotten the memory leak down to a minimal case: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/hopengl/2009-January/000782.html
14:05:34 <rwbarton> drdozer: it will only start new lightweight threads, not OS threads
14:05:36 <yitz> dmead: my guess is they need some prodding to get it going again
14:05:46 <mauke> Guenni: but (>>=) :: Identity a -> (a -> Identity b) -> Identity b
14:05:52 <drdozer> rwbarton: oh :( I need something like that which starts OS threads
14:05:54 <ski_> Guenni : yes, but `(+3)' is not of the correct type
14:06:11 <dmead> yea i found it
14:06:11 <rwbarton> drdozer: I think the number of OS threads is fixed at program start
14:06:12 <baaba> :t Identity 12 >>= return . (+3)
14:06:12 <ski_> (so, bad example)
14:06:13 <lambdabot> forall b. (Num b) => Identity b
14:06:18 <dmead> i have haskell-cafe copied to a folder
14:06:27 <dmead> seems they got into the compiler guts
14:06:49 <Guenni> ski_, mauke: sry I get, return is missing, it needs to be re-wrapped, sry
14:07:10 <mauke> or you could use liftM :-)
14:07:10 <dmead> hmm
14:07:13 <mauke> but yes
14:07:15 <dmead> i wonder if theres a way around this
14:07:28 <dmead> like, how can you execute x86 code on an arm
14:07:31 <Guenni> mauke, ski_, thx
14:08:01 <yitz> dmead: they weren't generating arm code?
14:08:20 <rwbarton> drdozer: hmm, maybe not.  You can try s/forkIO/forkOS/, but I don't have high expectations
14:08:26 <dmead> yitz, doesn't seem like it
14:08:32 <dmead> the last message is from august 25
14:09:02 <rwbarton> drdozer: (with -threaded of course)
14:09:22 <yitz> dmead: I seem to remember that they said there was some small piece that was missing, that was to be released as part of 6.10.
14:09:36 <yitz> dmead: so I think they did get past the start line
14:09:54 <dmead> ah
14:10:48 <dmead> yitz, what if i tell ghc to emit C and then cross compile that?
14:11:07 <yitz> dmead: yeah, sounds like something like that
14:16:28 <drdozer> mm, when I run it with -N8, the program burns minutes of CPU and never gets as far as -N1 does in 10 sec
14:18:11 <gwern> there is no silver bullet
14:18:37 <drdozer> no, but it seems to be burning all that CPU *before* reaching the parMapM code
14:18:37 <CosmicRay> what am I missing in the new base?
14:18:42 <CosmicRay> instance Exception ArithException where
14:18:42 <CosmicRay>     toException = ArithException
14:18:42 <CosmicRay>     fromException (ArithException e) = Just e
14:18:42 <CosmicRay>     fromException _ = Nothing
14:18:49 <CosmicRay> but there is no ArithException constructor.
14:19:12 <CosmicRay> ArithException can only be created by Overflow, Underflow, etc.
14:19:15 <ski_> glguy : how's `abort' defined ?
14:20:19 <dolio> abort e = ContT $ \_ -> return e
14:21:57 <ehird> How should I decide where to place my heirarchical package?
14:21:58 <ehird> module
14:22:22 <dolio> Do you have a dart board?
14:22:33 <ski_> i thought i saw some `AbortM' class mentioned ..
14:22:40 <ehird> dolio: :-)
14:22:45 <rwbarton> Throw a dart at dons' tag cloud :)
14:23:12 <yitz> ehird: Dart.Board.Bullseye.MyModule
14:23:24 <dolio> Oh yeah. There is some class for that in monadLib...
14:24:09 <dolio> class AbortM e m | m -> e where abort :: e -> m a, perhaps?
14:24:21 <loadquo> We need to be stronger on pugs...
14:24:47 <dolio> Oh, apparently there's no fundep.
14:26:00 <doserj> CosmicRay: there is Control.OldException
14:26:14 <CosmicRay> doserj: yes
14:26:19 <CosmicRay> I am porting to the new exception model though.
14:26:28 <CosmicRay> and now I'm having a problem with try
14:26:29 <int80_h> @seen lemmih
14:26:29 <lambdabot> lemmih is in #haskell. I don't know when lemmih last spoke.
14:26:35 <CosmicRay> I want to catch *any* exception
14:26:38 <CosmicRay> that worked in 6.8
14:26:40 <CosmicRay> now I get
14:26:43 <int80_h> chessguy, hi there.
14:26:45 <CosmicRay> Database/HDBC/Utils.hs:153:16:
14:26:45 <CosmicRay>     Ambiguous type variable `e1' in the constraint:
14:26:45 <CosmicRay>       `Exception e1'
14:26:45 <CosmicRay>         arising from a use of `try' at Database/HDBC/Utils.hs:153:16-34
14:26:45 <CosmicRay>     Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
14:26:55 <Heffalump> CosmicRay: you're not supposed to catch any exception
14:27:01 <chessguy_> hi from my iPhone
14:27:02 <ski_> dolio : ok .. so `abort' in that class is supposed to be the above definition for `Cont o', then ?
14:27:08 <Heffalump> There are combinators to capture the patterns in which it's considered reasonable to do so
14:27:10 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: err.  parse rror.
14:27:15 <Heffalump> e.g. a 'finally' style thing
14:27:17 <dolio> ski_: Yes.
14:27:19 <jvoorhis> conal: i've been trying to find a way to use FRP techniques for music making, and i wondered if you had any input about what sorts of values such a system should operate on
14:27:21 <int80_h> chessguy_ : did you mod it?
14:27:25 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: what are these combinators?
14:27:32 <Heffalump> I can't remember, but the haddock knows.
14:27:33 <chessguy_> mid it?
14:27:49 <ski_> dolio : so what are the laws `abort' should meet .. maybe it's documented in some docs for `AbortM' ?
14:27:50 <int80_h> chessguy_ did you modify your iphone
14:28:00 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Control-Exception.html#v%3Atry
14:28:02 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: is it there?
14:28:10 <Lemmih> int80_h: What's up?
14:28:11 <chessguy_> no, why would I
14:28:13 <dolio> glguy: It looks like most of the multi-parameter type classes have ordering like "FooM monadvar othervars". Doesn't that get in the way of generalized newtype deriving?
14:28:27 <augustss> CosmicRay: Or make sure the exception hase type SomeException if you really want to catch them all
14:28:34 <Heffalump> CosmicRay: yes
14:28:36 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: here's the thing.  I want to perform an action.  afterwords, if it raised no exception, do action A.  if it raised an exception, do action B, then re-raise it
14:28:37 <int80_h> Lemmih : could you increase the time before ssh dies on seize.it?
14:28:48 <conal> jvoorhis: music.  hmm.  can be tricky, in that sound already has a temporal aspect.  perhaps less easily separated from (made orthogonal to) time than some other uses of frp.
14:28:50 <jvoorhis> conal: in fran, the goal, roughly, is to produce the behavior of a scene
14:28:54 <Heffalump> that's what onException is for
14:29:02 <dolio> ski_: I don't know. The only other instance is 'instance AbortM IO ExitCode where abort = exitWith'.
14:29:04 <conal> jvoorhis: yeah.
14:29:11 <jvoorhis> but in a musical setting, notes have instantaneous attack and release points
14:29:14 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: I have no idea what onException does because it has no docs.
14:29:16 <glguy> dolio, yeah, generalized newtype deriving is kind of limited, so MonadLib.Derive helps automate the process
14:29:19 <Heffalump> at least I think that's what it's for :-)
14:29:25 <dolio> ski_: Presumably "abort e >>= f = abort e".
14:29:28 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: ah ha, you have the same problem ;-)
14:29:41 <Heffalump> well, I'm sure you're capable of getting and reading GHC source and submitting a docs patch :-p
14:29:51 <ehird> will people kill me if I put a package outside the hierarchy in root? D:
14:29:52 <ehird> *:D
14:29:56 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: already fired up less
14:30:06 <conal> jvoorhis: i'm not sure attack/release introduces anything new & different.  visual animations have finite sub-animations as well.
14:30:16 <CosmicRay> Heffalump: you may indeed be right.
14:30:27 <jvoorhis> conal: sub-animations of essentially 0-duration?
14:30:33 <Heffalump> I'm always right. Except when I'm not, obviously.
14:30:44 * ski_ recalls attach-decay-sustain-release
14:31:01 <glguy> abort is behaves like mzero
14:31:11 <conal> jvoorhis: oh -- i think i'm mis-guessed about what you thought would be unusual for frp.
14:31:11 <glguy> where my mplus is
14:31:12 <Lemmih> int80_h: If you tell me how, sure.
14:31:27 <int80_h> lemmih: I'll look it up
14:31:34 <glguy> mplus a b = callCC $ \ k -> lift (runContT k a) >> b
14:31:52 <conal> jvoorhis: i'd expect that attack & release would correspond to *transitions* in a behavior, probably "due to" events.
14:31:55 <jvoorhis> conal: i'd be curious to know what your guess was, but i actually just had an interesting thought about it
14:32:05 <conal> jvoorhis: like a bouncing ball.
14:32:08 <jvoorhis> ah, i was about to say something about transitions :)
14:32:14 <yitz> ehird: what does your package do?
14:32:20 <ehird> yitz: Things.
14:32:34 <jvoorhis> conal: but more in the sense of a finite state machine
14:32:44 <chessguy_> hmm. no tab-complete on here I guess
14:32:45 <yitz> ehird: Things.MyModule
14:32:51 <ehird> Things.DoThings
14:33:05 <yitz> ehird: ah, then it's Control.Things.DoThings
14:33:15 <ehird> Manipulate things. Thingy.
14:33:21 <chessguy_> but there is auto-correct
14:33:23 <dublpaws> :t Things
14:33:24 <lambdabot> Not in scope: data constructor `Things'
14:33:36 <yitz> @hoogle things
14:33:36 <lambdabot> No results found
14:34:07 <yitz> ehird: sounds like you are providing a unique capability to Haskell.
14:34:12 <ehird> very.
14:34:24 <ehird> I aim to advance the things market to make Haskell truly suitable for real-world applications.
14:34:28 <ehird> In a thingy way.
14:34:42 <chessguy_> this could make my next road trip much more fun
14:34:49 <yitz> ehird: Control.Acme.Things.DoThings
14:35:00 <ehird> yitz: you forgot the manipulation. of things
14:35:15 <jvoorhis> conal: e.g. the behavior could transition from "all-notes-off" to "c is being sounded", and that change causes some action to be triggered
14:36:07 <conal> jvoorhis: watch out for any notion of "action".  it'll probably lead you from functional to imperative thinking.
14:36:12 <chessguy> it's still way easier to use my laptop for IRC when i'm at home though :)
14:36:37 <rwbarton> ehird: there are a bunch of packages (mostly programs) that make up their own top-level module names.  As far as I know their authors are alive :)
14:36:56 <loadquo> What did I need to install to stop the command characters in ghci?
14:36:56 <ehird> but what about my children?!
14:37:20 <conal> jvoorhis: there was some recent work by by George Giorgidze and Henrik Nilsson: "Switched-on Yampa: Declarative programming of modular synthesizers".  See http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/papers.html
14:37:51 <dolio> @type \a b -> callCC (\k -> lift (runContT a k) >> b)
14:37:52 <lambdabot>     Occurs check: cannot construct the infinite type: m = t m
14:37:53 <lambdabot>       Expected type: m a
14:37:53 <lambdabot>       Inferred type: t m b
14:38:38 <conal> jvoorhis: just as you can thinking about numbers & strings without actions like 'print', you can think about music without actions like start/stop synthesizer.
14:39:03 <bohdan> @bots
14:39:03 <lambdabot> :)
14:39:03 <lunabot>  :)
14:39:21 <ddarius> @botattack
14:39:21 <lunabot>  :)
14:39:21 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
14:39:26 <conal> jvoorhis: or animation without things like "set pixel" or "flip buffer"
14:39:34 <bohdan> So I was asking this, but looks like my irc client didn't send anything
14:39:42 <bohdan> How would you implement zip with foldr
14:40:33 <vixey> bohdan, I would not
14:40:56 <Saizan> uhm you can't write mplus in the "orElse" sense with only Cont, right?
14:41:11 <dublpaws> IO could probably write straight to /dev/audio
14:41:15 <jvoorhis_> conal: but at the outermost layer, these things do happen :)
14:41:25 <ski_> bohdan : do you want spoiler or hints ?
14:41:49 <conal> "outermost" is exactly the key.  make sure they stay outermost, which means even outside of the functional programming model.
14:42:11 <jvoorhis_> conal: are you suggesting that i just maintain a clear break between the model and its relaization?
14:42:19 <jvoorhis_> realization, even
14:42:23 <conal> "outermost" because actions (e.g., Haskel IO) fundamentally thwarts compositionality.
14:42:50 <conal> jvoorhis_: i've called this distinction "model" vs "presentation".
14:43:08 <conal> as a more specific (to my ears) distinction
14:43:10 <jvoorhis_> conal: "presentation" sounds a little nicer than "view" here
14:43:23 <bohdan> ski_: I don't know :) I imagine I would produce a list of (b->(a,b)) with the first fold and the reduce [b] with that to [(a,b)]
14:43:49 <ehird> What's the syntax to enable -Xfoo in ghc source?
14:44:00 <bohdan> ski_: I don't know meaning that I should probably go ahead and try implementing it
14:44:06 <Saizan> {-# LANGUAGE Foo #-}
14:44:11 <bohdan> ski_: if what's I'm thinking about is a good way
14:44:54 <augustss> bohdan: implementing zip with foldr should be done only as a puzzle, not for real use
14:44:55 <conal> jvoorhis_: i think i discussed this principle in http://conal.net/papers/tse-modeled-animation/
14:45:20 <ski_> bohdan : sure, try around :)
14:45:35 <jvoorhis_> conal: so perhaps the outermost layer will sample the behavior of its state, and perform some IO activities when it notices a state transition
14:45:48 <conal> imagine trying to add two numbers via some composition of their string form.
14:45:49 <ski_> (augustss : any specific reason ?)
14:45:55 <conal> or, worse yet, their print actions.
14:46:05 <ehird> Saizan: thanks :)
14:46:31 <augustss> ski_: I have a hard time believing it can beat the recursive version in readability and speed.
14:46:39 <bohdan> augustss: any real reason? shouldn't the compiler be smart to just optimize it away? :)
14:46:40 <conal> jvoorhis_: yeah.  something like that would be the equivalent of "putStrLn".
14:46:59 * bohdan still believes in santa, unicorns and optimizing compilers
14:47:04 <ski_> augustss : i don't know .. maybe it could fuse better
14:47:12 <conal> jvoorhis_: i.e., the as-thin-as-possible interface from function to imperative.
14:47:16 <augustss> bohdan: if you obfuscate enough the compiler gives up :)
14:47:33 <ski_> (as in `foldr'-`build' fusion)
14:47:43 <conal> (s/function/functional/)
14:47:47 * ksf just read plugging a space leak with an arrow, stumbled across http://books.google.de/books?id=Bod5HbPh-WwC and feels like a kid facing a heap of chocolate at least thrice its size
14:47:49 <jvoorhis_> conal: that makes sense
14:47:53 <bohdan> how would I erase the stuff I defined with lets in ghci?
14:48:01 <augustss> ski_: I think it only fuses with unfoldr fusion
14:48:13 <bohdan> aha, :undef
14:48:14 <koeien> bohdan: you can reload a file and it's gone
14:48:22 <conal> jvoorhis_: and i'd watch out for that word "state", too.
14:48:47 <ski_> augustss : if it only uses `foldr' and `build' for the deconstruction and construction of lists, why should `unfoldr' be relevant ?
14:49:28 <augustss> ski_: I can't give you a proof, but as far as I know nobody has managed to write zip so it fuses with foldr-build
14:49:29 <conal> jvoorhis_: although you might not be using it in an imperative sense.
14:49:51 <jvoorhis_> conal: i'm not sure whether i was :)
14:49:54 <augustss> ski_: but it does fuse with destroy-unfoldr
14:50:06 <doserj> CosmicRay: http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg51094.html may be interesting
14:50:40 <conal> jvoorhis_: one of my purposes for FRP is as a way to help rewire people's thinking.
14:50:44 <jvoorhis_> conal: for the sake of the argument, i'm imagining some hypothetical midi renderer that spans my frp behaviors and my roland juno
14:50:45 <augustss> ski_: http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~josefs/publications/fusion.ps
14:50:58 <conal> jvoorhis_: nice
14:51:07 <bohdan> > foldr (+) [] [a,b,c]
14:51:08 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `[a]' against inferred type `Expr'
14:51:17 <vixey> conal, (which is laudable)
14:51:26 <conal> vixey: :)
14:51:27 <jvoorhis_> conal: so let's imagine my value is the set of notes that are currently being sounded
14:51:32 <bohdan> > foldr (+) [] [a,b,c] :: [Expr]
14:51:33 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `[a]' against inferred type `Expr'
14:51:42 <bohdan> arr
14:51:49 <jvoorhis_> conal: and that currently-sounded behavior is being sampled
14:51:51 <ski_> augustss : i don't know details about `foldr'-`build' fusion, but my version solely use `foldr' and `build' ..
14:51:53 <bohdan> > foldr (+) a [b,c,d]
14:51:54 <lambdabot>   b + (c + (d + a))
14:52:06 <augustss> ski_: does it fuse?
14:52:22 <ski_> augustss : no idea. i'm not sure how i would know
14:52:37 <jvoorhis_> conal: so we transition from { 60, 64, 67 } to { 60, 67 } – this hypothetical outermost-layer would notice that 64 disappeared at the next sample point, so it would trigger a note-off message for 64
14:52:37 <bohdan> > foldr (\a rest -> ((,) a) : rest) [] [a,b,c,d]
14:52:38 <lambdabot>       Overlapping instances for Show (b -> (Expr, b))
14:52:38 <lambdabot>        arising from a u...
14:52:54 <bohdan> > foldr (\a rest -> ((,) a) : rest) [] [1,2,3,4]
14:52:55 <lambdabot>       Overlapping instances for Show (b -> (a, b))
14:52:55 <lambdabot>        arising from a use ...
14:52:59 <conal> jvoorhis_: sounds good
14:52:59 <augustss> ski_: look at the output after transformations
14:53:03 <conal> jvoorhis_: btw, in addition to "switched on yampa", check out paul hudak's haskore.
14:53:07 <ehird> Is there a lightweight embeddable HTTP server?
14:53:10 <ehird> Something I can just stick into an app.
14:53:20 <jvoorhis_> conal: i've ported haskore to ruby :)
14:53:29 <jvoorhis_> parts of it, anyways
14:53:36 <conal> oh!
14:53:44 <jvoorhis_> but i haven't seen switched on yamp yet :)
14:53:47 <jvoorhis_> yampa even
14:54:36 <jvoorhis_> here's a transcription of a chopin prelude: http://github.com/jvoorhis/music.rb/blob/61bcf339c2896b13763e1d0b00f1d07f4a096042/examples/chopin.rb
14:54:41 <jvoorhis_> it can be played back in realtime
14:55:01 <dolio> > let zipWith f as bs = foldr (\b aabs as -> foldr (\a _ -> f a b : aabs (tail as)) [] as) (const []) bs as in zipWith (,) [1..10] [1..10]
14:55:02 <lambdabot>   [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10)]
14:55:16 <jvoorhis_> or pretty-printed, or whatever else my outermost layers support :)
14:55:25 <bohdan> that was a spoiler :)
14:55:29 * bohdan mustn't look
14:55:35 <conal> jvoorhis_: :)
14:56:17 <ski_> dolio : that's cheating
14:56:23 <vixey> > let zipVith f as bs = foldr (\x ys -> f x ys) bs as in zipWith (,) [1..10] [1..10]
14:56:24 <augustss> ski_: the tricky thing is make it fuse for both arguments
14:56:24 <lambdabot>   [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10)]
14:56:30 <ehird> > zip [1..10] [1..10]
14:56:31 <vixey> ^^ if you /thought/ dolio cheated :p
14:56:31 <lambdabot>   [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10)]
14:56:36 <ehird> That was ... hard?
14:56:46 <dolio> ski_: How's it cheating?
14:56:56 <ski_> dolio : `tail'
14:57:04 <dolio> You can implement tail with foldr, too.
14:57:07 <jvoorhis_> conal: hudak's PTM model is brilliant, and it makes it really easy to construct values
14:57:11 <ski_> yeah, that's cheating
14:57:49 <ski_> (augustss : i'm not sure how to "look at the output after transformations")
14:58:07 <jvoorhis_> conal: i wish i knew a way to simplify *transforming* them in different ways
14:58:13 <ehird> :t foldr
14:58:13 <dolio> > let tail = snd . foldr (\x (l,'l) -> (x:l,l)) ([],error "tail of empty list") in tail [1..10]

14:58:26 <dolio> > let tail = snd . foldr (\x (l,_) -> (x:l,l)) ([],error "tail of empty list") in tail [1..10]
14:58:28 <lambdabot>   [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
14:58:29 <ski_> augustss : fwiw, my version is <http://www.mdstud.chalmers.se/~md9slj/code/FoldrZip.hs> (it doesn't use `build' but could easily be changed to do so)
14:58:30 <augustss> ski_: ghc has lots of debug flags to look at the intermediate results when compiling
14:58:33 <jvoorhis_> there are a few obvious operations like reversing, and truncating
14:58:33 <dolio> > let tail = snd . foldr (\x (l,_) -> (x:l,l)) ([],error "tail of empty list") in tail []
14:58:35 <lambdabot>   * Exception: tail of empty list
14:59:06 <augustss> ski_: Perhaps you should talk to Josef Svenningsson :)
14:59:25 <ski_> dolio : i'm not sure how to explicate it nicely, but if you use `foldr' not to traverse the whole lists, instead jsut extract head or tail, then i think that's cheating
14:59:30 <jvoorhis_> but performing some operation such as "dividing the third beat" for example, is tedious
14:59:38 <dolio> Well, you're wrong. :)
14:59:45 <ski_> augustss : hm, that's an idea i could try
15:00:41 <conal> jvoorhis_: perhaps it would help to have a blog and tinker out loud there with the tricky stuff.  might engage other people's creativity.
15:00:43 <ski_> (dolio : i'm not convinced there's a hard distinction here .. but it feels to me like there is :)
15:00:53 <augustss> You can't implement tail efficiently with foldr.
15:00:55 <ehird> > let last = foldr (\a _ -> a) (error "last: empty list") in last []
15:00:56 <lambdabot>   * Exception: last: empty list
15:01:00 <ehird> > let last = foldr (\a _ -> a) (error "last: empty list") in last [1,2,3]
15:01:01 <lambdabot>   1
15:01:05 <conal> jvoorhis_: especially if your blog is on planet.haskell.org
15:01:06 <ehird> ... huh.
15:01:13 <ehird> > let last = foldl (\a _ -> a) (error "last: empty list") in last [1,2,3]
15:01:14 <lambdabot>   * Exception: last: empty list
15:01:39 <dolio> Well, an efficient zipWith should use unfoldr.
15:02:11 <dolio> If you want to adhere to theoretical stuff.
15:02:34 <dolio> Manual recursion with pattern matching is probably more efficent than unfoldr.
15:02:47 <ehird> > let last = foldr (\a _ -> a) (error "last: empty list") in last [1,2,3]
15:02:48 <lambdabot>   1
15:02:50 <ski_> dolio : so my version is not efficient ?
15:02:51 <ehird> Why on earth doesn't that work?
15:02:58 <jvoorhis_> conal: i might get around to that yet – i've been a little reluctant to start blogging again :)
15:03:07 <pumpkin> augustss: I implemented a perfectly good one yesterday using foldr
15:03:12 <ddarius> ehird: Because you wrote head not last.
15:03:26 <ehird> ddarius: Uh, thanks for that :-P
15:03:31 <augustss> pumpkin: an O(1) tail with foldr?
15:03:32 <ehird> Oh, I see what's wrong
15:03:38 <pumpkin> augustss: yup ;)
15:03:45 <stepcut> why does runhaskell Setup configure say, Warning: In the use of `defaultUserHooks' (imported from Distribution.Simple): Deprecated: "Use simpleUserHooks or autoconfUserHooks.", even though I *am* using simpleUserHooks
15:03:45 <pumpkin> but I'll stop wasting people's time

15:03:50 <lambdabot>   * Exception: last: empty list

15:03:53 <ehird> right

15:04:05 <lambdabot>   (a,* Exception: last: empty list
15:04:08 <ehird> oops.
15:04:28 <conal> jvoorhis_: i like that my blog gives me as much or little space as i want to introduce a problem and ideas about it, and a coherent space for discussing with people.
15:04:45 <augustss> pumpkin: you must have been cheating, since you can prove it's impossible :)
15:04:46 <stepcut> oh, because the Setup.hs I was editing was the wrong one
15:04:50 <conal> i'm writing a blog post right now.
15:04:56 <pumpkin> augustss: it was a beautiful cheat though!
15:05:10 <augustss> pumpkin: so show us!
15:05:20 <lamente> a beautiful chest, where?
15:05:25 <pumpkin> > foldr (const tail) [1,2,3] [()]
15:05:26 <lambdabot>   [2,3]
15:05:29 <pumpkin> yay!
15:05:54 <augustss> pumpkin: I can make a shorter one: const tail foldr
15:05:58 <pumpkin> :(
15:06:20 <pumpkin> fine, one-up me :(

15:08:33 <chessguy_work> @remember sigfpe If I took some Ritalin, maybe I could write an entire book on Haskell and algebra
15:08:33 <lambdabot> Okay.
15:08:57 <pumpkin> chessguy_work: you're on twitter?
15:09:01 <ski_> chessguy_work : ?
15:09:01 <chessguy_work> indeed
15:09:02 <SubStack> delicious algebra
15:09:15 <pumpkin> ski_: sigfpe just tweeted that
15:09:15 <chessguy_work> pumpkin, arwagner
15:09:31 <pumpkin> sweet
15:10:01 <ski_> chessguy_work : you were pinging me a day or two ago ?
15:10:08 <chessguy_work> oh
15:10:27 <chessguy_work> ski_ was gonna show you what i came up with re: forward-chaining as a fold
15:10:42 <ehird> list pattern matching should be outlawed. all hail the folds
15:11:16 <augustss> ehird: why not outlaw all pattern matching?
15:11:26 <ehird> Because then we cannot implement folds.
15:11:29 <ski_> Charity ftw
15:11:42 <mauke> we can, by implementing lists as folds
15:11:47 <roconnor> gwern: I know your email address now :P
15:11:47 <lambdabot> roconnor: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
15:11:49 <augustss> ehird: deriving Foldable
15:11:51 <ehird> mauke: That is genius.
15:11:58 <chessguy_work> my macbook appears to be out of gas though :(

15:12:37 <vixey> who cares for fold?
15:12:44 <vixey> you want fix + case
15:12:48 <chessguy_work> ski_ : i'll @tell you the link sometime
15:12:48 <roconnor> gwern: :D looks like you got to me first.  I just read your message
15:13:47 <ski_> ok
15:13:56 <Toxaris> type List a = forall b . (a -> b -> b) -> b -> b  -- not sure what to do about the "forall b" here, or is that allowed as-is?
15:15:28 <Saizan> it's allowed
15:15:31 <hdevalence> hey, this is probably a f.a.q., but suppose I want to learn haskell (have some C++ experience, but not a great deal, only about a year). From what I can see, Haskell, being a functional programming language, is very different from what I know already. What I don't want to do is end up programming the way I would program in C++ in Haskell. Howw do I get myself into the right mindset? Or am I concerned with the wrong thing?
15:15:39 * ksf tried to calm down Peter wrt. space leaks in reactive, did some research, realized he doesn't know a thing and now wants conal to tell him that there can't be any, ever, under any circumstance
15:15:47 <chessguy_work> @faq does hdevalence have the right mindset?
15:15:47 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
15:15:52 <chessguy_work> hmm
15:16:11 <Toxaris> (:) :: a -> List a -> List a; (a : as) cons nil = cons a (as cons nil)
15:16:12 <chrisdone> hdevalence: Real World Haskell teaches those with programming experience, and I guess to think functionally, but it's hard to say because I knew lisp before coming to haskell
15:16:15 <dolio> ski_: Yours is probably similar to the unfoldr version.
15:16:19 <gwern> roconnor: yeah, well, I knew yours first!
15:16:30 <gsiklos> hello everyone
15:16:38 <yitz> @faq can haskell expand hdevalence's mind?
15:16:38 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
15:16:39 <gwern> roconnor: the woman sent me an apologetic note after I mailed them and pointed out the error :)
15:16:43 <Cale> hdevalence: You'll basically be *forced* to think differently for the most part.
15:16:48 <gwern> roconnor: I'll bet today was a bad day for her
15:16:49 <chessguy_work> hdevalence, don't mind me, i'm just teasing. yes, haskell is much different from c++ and other imperative languages. RWH talks a lot about the right mindset for programming in haskell
15:16:52 <chessguy_work> @where rwh
15:16:52 <lambdabot> is http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/
15:16:59 <SubStack> this monadic stuff is totally going to my head lately
15:17:06 * SubStack has been doing some glut programming in haskell
15:17:08 <conal> ksf: huh?  which Peter?
15:17:28 <ksf> Verswyvelen
15:17:32 <hdevalence> I started reading "learn you a haskell", I'll check out RWH. Thanks so much for the advice!
15:18:02 <chrisdone> hdevalence: I think it's a reasonable thing to be concerned about. for example, people ask "how do I do while loops?" and are often unsatisfied that the answer in Haskell is a new way of looking at the problem
15:18:03 <ski_> dolio : `unfoldr' to me signifies creating a potentially infinite list .. i only use `foldr' for recursion, so i don't imagine how it could be similar
15:18:06 <SubStack> gl programming is so much more fun in haskell than c ;)
15:18:09 <ksf> (which is, if dutch maps to german according to my intuition, a hell of a strange name)
15:18:10 <conal> ksf: oh.  i didn't realize you knew him.
15:18:14 <Cale> hdevalence: Learn you a Haskell looks like it should be fun too.
15:18:15 <ski_> dolio : maybe you could reference the `unfoldr' version ?
15:18:26 <yitz> hdevalence: LYAHFGG followed by RWH is a nice path
15:18:44 <roconnor> nooo
15:18:46 <roconnor>     Could not find module `Graphics.Rendering.Cairo.SVG':
15:18:50 <ksf> well, I do have phases where I care about the cafe.
15:18:50 <idnar> I have to say that LYAHFGG has a seriously off-putting name
15:18:54 <conal> ksf: i know some german and a little dutch now (after last summer in antwerp), but not enough to guess what you have in mind
15:18:56 <gsiklos> does anyone know if there is a haskell module that implements root finding for a set of equations? I found the hmatrix module that interfaces a lot of stuff from the C GSL library but not the root finding functions.
15:19:09 <idnar> it makes it sound like the whole thing is written in lolcat or something
15:19:19 <dolio> > let f ([],_) = Nothing ; f (_,[]) = Nothing ; f (x:xs,y:ys) = Just ((x,y),(xs,ys)) in unfoldr f ([1..10],[1..9])
15:19:20 <lambdabot>   [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9)]
15:19:22 <roconnor> can I get ghc-pkg to list the modules exported by cairo-0.9.12.1 ?
15:19:39 <ksf> conal, "schwuveln" isn't likely to be found in any german dictionary, anyway.
15:20:01 <chessguy_work> hey home come there's no class (Monad r) => Runnable r where run :: r a -> a
15:20:14 <Heffalump> because it'd have very few instances
15:20:15 <mauke> chessguy_work: because it's useless
15:20:22 <Saizan> roconnor: ghc-pkg field cairo-0.9.12.1 exposed-modules
15:20:27 <chessguy_work> mauke, why is thaht?
15:20:28 <augustss> chessguy_work: it's rarely that simple
15:20:37 <idnar> @type runState
15:20:38 * chessguy_work listens
15:20:39 <lambdabot> forall s a. State s a -> s -> (a, s)
15:20:44 <mauke> chessguy_work: well, what instances are there outside Identity?
15:20:46 <ehird> mauke: I did that "lists as folds" thing :-)
15:20:48 <conal> ksf: thanks for trac ticket #22, btw.
15:20:54 <chessguy_work> mauke, Maybe?
15:20:58 <ski_> dolio : mhm
15:20:58 <pumpkin> mauke: ST?
15:20:59 <mauke> chessguy_work: nope
15:21:07 <dolio> ski_: Similar performance, I mean.
15:21:09 <chessguy_work> @type fromJust
15:21:11 <lambdabot> forall a. Maybe a -> a
15:21:12 <Heffalump> mauke: Writer
15:21:20 <chessguy_work> run = fromJust
15:21:26 <Heffalump> and [] and Maybe if you don't mind partiality
15:21:26 <mauke> chessguy_work: that's unsafe!
15:21:26 <Toxaris> chessguy_work: class UnsafeRunnable where unsafeRun :: r a -> a
15:21:37 <gsiklos> anyone for the root finding question?
15:21:39 <chessguy_work> Toxaris, fine
15:21:43 <ski_> dolio : ok, the performance bit (module fusion, at least), i don't doubt
15:21:43 <mauke> Heffalump: yeah, except you'd lose the written stuff
15:21:43 <chessguy_work> but it still typechecks
15:21:48 <chessguy_work> and works
15:21:52 <idnar> chessguy_work: you want runState and fromMaybe and ...
15:21:56 <idnar> chessguy_work: all of which have different types
15:22:01 <dolio> ski_: Your version turns the lists into representations that do that one-step pattern matching, more or less.
15:22:06 <chessguy_work> @type fromMaybe
15:22:06 <roconnor> I wonder if I can install cairo from hackage
15:22:07 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> Maybe a -> a
15:22:17 <dolio> Only with continuations. And then it feeds them into each other.
15:22:26 <idnar> @type runCont
15:22:27 <lambdabot> forall r a. Cont r a -> (a -> r) -> r
15:22:33 <chessguy_work> we have head, we have fromJust, i'm sure there are others
15:22:36 <roconnor> nope
15:22:40 <pumpkin> how about runST?
15:22:45 <dcoutts> roconnor: no
15:22:45 <mauke> :t runST
15:22:46 <lambdabot> forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -> a
15:22:49 <chessguy_work> @type execState
15:22:50 <lambdabot> forall s a. State s a -> s -> s
15:23:00 <chessguy_work> i never remenber which is which
15:23:01 * ksf would have a clearer sense of what schwuveln means if he had been born in colonge.
15:23:05 <augustss> chessguy_work: I'd never use that class
15:23:08 <chessguy_work> evalState
15:23:16 <chessguy_work> augustss, because it's partial?
15:23:26 <roconnor> dcoutts: I need 0.9.13 for Graphics.Rendering.Cairo.SVG ?
15:23:41 <chessguy_work> i'm not disagreeing with anyone, just trying to understand
15:23:46 <ski_> dolio : yes .. but i rely on `foldr' for termination, instead of needing to ensure that the step in `unfoldr' eventually reaches `Nothing' ..
15:23:50 <augustss> chessguy_work: because I typically care about the other cases, I want to know when it's nothing.  The full list, etc, etc
15:24:05 * ski_ wonders
15:24:12 <ddarius> Such a run function would likely defeat the point of using the monad in the first place.
15:24:20 <chessguy_work> augustss, so then head shouldn't exist?
15:24:28 <chessguy_work> or fromJust?
15:24:36 <chessguy_work> or evalState?
15:24:47 <augustss> chessguy_work: evalState is ok
15:24:54 <ddarius> evalState isn't State s a -> a
15:24:57 <chessguy_work> @hoogle (Monad m) => m a -> a
15:24:58 <lambdabot> Prelude (>>) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b
15:24:58 <lambdabot> Control.Monad (>>) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b
15:24:58 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.Instances (>>) :: Monad m => m a -> m b -> m b
15:24:59 <idnar> chessguy_work: generalising across all those isn't terribly useful
15:25:10 <ski_> chessguy_work : try implementing `forall o a. Cont o a -> a'
15:25:10 <idnar> chessguy_work: (also, head and fromJust shouldn't exist :D)
15:25:16 <augustss> chessguy_work: what I'm saying is that if I've used the Maybe monad I hardly ever use fromJust on the result
15:25:42 <chessguy_work> ski_ of course it's not useful for every monad
15:25:45 <Toxaris> chessguy_work: the point about an abstraction is to enable code which works for every instance of the abstraction. which code do you have in mind which works for more then one instance of Runnable?
15:25:47 <augustss> chessguy_work: nor head
15:26:02 <augustss> chessguy_work: nor do i put undefined as the start state for the state monad
15:26:05 <chessguy_work> Toxaris, that i don't know
15:26:07 <ski_> chessguy_work : i think it's more or less only useful for the `Identity' monad
15:27:14 <Pseudonym> @hoogle w a -> a
15:27:14 <lambdabot> Data.Monoid getDual :: Dual a -> a
15:27:14 <lambdabot> Foreign unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
15:27:14 <lambdabot> Data.ByteString.Internal inlinePerformIO :: IO a -> a
15:27:16 <ehird> :t \f l -> foldr (\a b -> f a : b) [] l
15:27:17 <lambdabot> forall a a1. (a -> a1) -> [a] -> [a1]
15:27:23 <ehird> Strange, it doesn't type with my FoldList...
15:27:26 <ehird> Ah, wait. Hrm.
15:27:34 <chessguy> so, partial functions suck and should be banned
15:27:41 <ehird> chessguy: Yes. :P
15:27:42 <chessguy> that's what i'm hearing
15:27:43 <dolio> ski_: Well, neither 'terminates' for two infinite lists.
15:27:48 <SamB_irssi> chessguy: eh?
15:27:50 <vixey> chessguy, It's easy to say that but have you tried total programming?
15:28:02 <ehird> vixey: I read a paper about total programming.
15:28:05 <ehird> It seemed great.
15:28:07 <augustss> chessguy: if partial functions should be banned is a totally different matter
15:28:11 <SamB_irssi> if that's so, we should use a ... er ... language that isn't turing complete
15:28:21 <vixey> everyone seems to be seduced by it but not actually putting it into practice
15:28:26 <Toxaris> chessguy: I have no problem with head & co. I just don't see a need for abstracting over them.
15:28:36 <vixey> "oh that looks nice, back to using head and unsafeCoerce"
15:28:36 <chessguy> hm, ok
15:28:52 <augustss> chessguy: all I'm saying is that when I'm using a monad I hardly ever use the partial function to select the result
15:29:04 <SamB_irssi> unsafeCoerce, you say ?
15:29:04 <chessguy> augustss, fair enough
15:29:29 <ski_> dolio : yes .. just that in my mind `foldr' is fundamentally a primitive for finite lists, while `unfoldr' being one for potentially finite streams
15:29:52 <augustss> chessguy: e.g., if I use an error monad it's because I want to do something when there's an error.  Otherwise I could just have called the error function instead of using a monad.
15:30:04 <dolio> Yes, and it's just as primitive for those.
15:30:05 <roconnor> awww
15:30:09 <roconnor>  libghc6-gtk-dev depends on ghc6 (>= 6.8.2-7); however:
15:30:09 <roconnor>   Version of ghc6 on system is 6.8.2-2ubuntu1.
15:30:22 <roconnor> ;(
15:30:27 <roconnor> :'(
15:30:50 <ski_> (dolio : however, another problem with this way of reasoning might be that my use of recursive newtypes *might* amount to similar things as the `newtype U a = MkU (U a -> a)' does .. so there might be unbounded recursion hidden there anyway, not sure)
15:31:04 <roconnor> so close
15:31:18 <ski_> dolio : what is just as primitive for what ?
15:31:33 <dolio> ski_: Coinductive lists.
15:31:44 <dolio> unfoldr is primitive for those.
15:31:52 <dolio> And there is no foldr.
15:31:53 * roconnor invesitagtes ubuntu packages
15:32:04 <dolio> Just like foldr is primitive for inductive lists, and there is no unfoldr.
15:32:04 <MacNala> is chessguy watching
15:32:29 <dolio> If you're working in languages that restrict things that way.
15:32:30 <chessguy> eh?
15:32:36 <chessguy> MacNala, ?
15:32:39 <ski_> dolio : right. so i was trying to write `zipWith' for finite lists, using `foldr' (and `build') as sole recursion means
15:32:42 <roconnor> oh
15:32:44 <MacNala> you sent me a mail
15:33:04 <roconnor> if I upgrade to intrepid I'll get 0.9.13-2ubuntu3
15:33:04 <chessguy> MacNala, i send lots of people mail :)
15:33:12 <vixey> I would love to see more people writing non-trivial programs in total language
15:33:14 <ski_> (dolio : for the potentially finite stream, there's no problem with using `unfoldr', of course)
15:33:17 <MacNala> reference real world and ghci
15:33:22 <dolio> ski_: Your datatype is negative, though, I think. So yeah, that wouldn't be allowed, either.
15:33:51 <chessguy> MacNala, oh. you were the one who said he didn't want to use IRC?
15:34:27 <MacNala> yes but i still dont know how to use it bear with me
15:34:32 <chessguy> MacNala, i need to go to dinner, but i'll be back in a little bit
15:34:41 <MacNala> sorry next time perhaps
15:34:45 <chessguy> MacNala, no problem, this is a wonderful, very friendly community
15:34:49 <ski_> (dolio : sorry again, `that' being ?)
15:34:52 <dolio> If you inline B's definition it's 'A a b c = MkA ((a -> A a b c -> [c]) -> [c])
15:34:53 <OnHoverboards> Velociraptors: y0
15:35:11 <SamB_irssi> Velociraptors: this is really a bad time
15:35:20 <chessguy> MacNala, in fact, you could ask anyone here for help, too
15:35:23 <blackh> chessguy: hrumph. Speak for yourself!
15:35:25 <SamB_irssi> shapr just got through saying we are a friendly community
15:35:31 <dolio> ski_: In languages that restrict you to strictly positive types to ensure totality, your types wouldn't be allowed.
15:35:47 <ski_> dolio : yes
15:35:55 <MacNala> one of the things i hate about irc has surfaced already
15:35:58 <vixey> newtype U a = MkU (U a -> a)
15:36:01 <vixey> is the same as
15:36:11 <vixey> data U a = MkU :: (U a -> a) -> U a   isn't it?
15:36:12 <SamB_irssi> MacNala: there are too many people in #haskell ?
15:36:31 <OnHoverboards> MacNala: What's that?
15:36:41 <dolio> Yes.
15:36:53 <MacNala> i do not understand this type of disconnnected conversation good bye
15:36:57 <OnHoverboards> oh
15:37:13 <vixey> I don't see any problem with it
15:37:16 <vixey> I wonder if it's monotone
15:37:21 <mauke> :hive mind:
15:37:24 <MacNala> i dont even know how to logout or whatever you do with this trash
15:37:27 <OnHoverboards> Yeh, it's too bad. This sort of monotonic disconnnected conversation can be fun.
15:37:32 <OnHoverboards> MacNala: Try /quit
15:37:36 <MacNala> quit
15:37:39 <ski_> vixey : i'm not sure .. try writing `omega' in it
15:37:51 <Badger> blimey.
15:37:54 <kmeyer> way to go, you got the new kid to make us netsplit
15:37:57 <roconnor> $ sudo do-release-upgrade
15:37:57 <roconnor> Checking for a new ubuntu release
15:37:57 <roconnor> No new release found
15:37:58 <lunabot>  luna: parse error on input `do'
15:38:01 <roconnor> crap
15:38:02 <OnHoverboards> Clearly a case of cognitive dissonance being transferred onto the people around him.
15:38:04 <vixey> ah
15:38:07 <vixey> if you let a = U x
15:38:07 <roconnor> that didn't work at all
15:38:10 <Badger> no need to take a whole bunch with him :P
15:38:12 <vixey> then I guess you can write omega in it
15:38:44 <Badger> at least we have Guest13894!
15:38:48 <shapr> Right on!
15:38:54 <blackh> roconnor: You have to ask Ubuntu very nicely if you want it to upgrade from 8.04.
15:38:55 <shapr> Badger: Badger badger ...
15:39:01 <Badger> shapr: shapr shapr ...
15:39:05 <glguy> MUSHROOM MUSHROOM
15:39:05 <shapr> mushroom?
15:39:07 <SamB_irssi> Badger: yes, but that 8 messes up the whole nick
15:39:10 <roconnor> blackh: oh right
15:39:14 * shapr cheers for glguy
15:39:21 <stepcut> potter potter potter
15:39:27 <shapr> um... snake?
15:39:30 <ski_> vixey : er, i misread `data U a = MkU :: (U a -> a) -> U a' as `data U a = MkU ((U a -> a) -> a)' .. forget what i said
15:39:38 <blackh> roconnor: It's a LTS (long term support) version and won't upgrade to 8.10 automatically.
15:39:41 <SamB_irssi> stepcut: voldemort voldemort voldemort ?
15:39:46 <shapr> y0 stepcut, did you show up in town and I missed you?
15:40:00 <roconnor> blackh -d
15:40:03 <stepcut> http://thefifthdistrict.com/potter/
15:40:07 <stepcut> shapr: yes
15:40:20 <vixey> ski_, i know how to prove false with data Weird = Weird :: (Weird -> Weird) -> Weird
15:40:21 <ddarius> shapr: He was avoiding you.
15:40:24 <vixey> and this U is pretty much the same
15:40:46 <shapr> aww
15:40:51 <ski_> (also, itym s/=/where/)
15:41:05 <ski_> vixey : how do you prove false with it ?
15:41:07 <dolio> foo :: U a -> a ; foo u@(U f) = f u ; evil :: a ; evil = foo (U foo)
15:41:08 <hackage> Uploaded to hackage: gnuplot 0.3
15:41:13 <augustss> Mmmm, fix with the name Weird!
15:41:52 <ski_> (vixey : `it' being `Weird')
15:42:07 <vixey> yes just how dolio wrote it actually
15:42:21 <ski_> with `U' i know
15:42:59 <ski_> i don't see how to do it with `Weird'
15:43:47 <dolio> Weird just gets you a non-terminating computation of type Weird.
15:43:51 <vixey> ski_, once you have omega with it, you can write a size measure, and prove that  size x = size (weird x)
15:44:23 <ski_> vixey> :t size
15:44:33 <Badger> hmm
15:44:36 <Badger> freenode is imploding
15:44:41 <ushdf> hey haskell people
15:44:42 <Badger> again.
15:44:54 <ushdf> look at my nifty functional PHP implementation http://128.230.216.163/tree
15:44:59 <SamB_irssi> Badger: it was worse last night, wasn't it ?
15:45:07 <ushdf> and ignore the minor formatting issues
15:45:14 <vixey> ski, Weird -> N
15:45:18 <Badger> I don't remember it being
15:45:23 <Badger> oh, wait
15:45:25 <Badger> THAT
15:45:35 <Badger> we lost a channel to that :P
15:45:43 <SamB_irssi> it was officially referred to as "this morning"
15:45:46 <shapr> netsplits bad today?
15:45:46 <SamB_irssi> Badger: what channel ?
15:45:48 <ski_> ushdf : i don't see any code there
15:45:52 <Badger> a small one
15:45:56 <ushdf> ski_ it's the code it's written in!
15:45:59 <ushdf> ;)
15:46:01 <SamB_irssi> everyone left
15:46:02 <SamB_irssi> ?
15:46:07 <ushdf> just tree navigation doodling
15:46:15 <Badger> yep, and the topic vanished :P
15:46:32 <ski_> ushdf : and what programming langauge is this ?
15:47:06 * Badger wonders when the global will come
15:47:22 <ushdf> PHP i said
15:47:29 <ray> thanks for flying freenode
15:47:31 <ushdf> functional PHP ;)
15:47:39 <SamB_irssi> Badger: shoulda used chanserv!
15:47:42 <Badger> crashing >_>
15:47:55 <ski_> ushdf : maybe you mean the javascript in the source ?
15:47:59 <Badger> SamB_irssi: didn't chanserv split? :P
15:48:00 <ushdf> no, i mean the PHP
15:48:56 <ski_> ushdf : even if that is valid PHP (which i doubt), what does this have to do with #haskell ?
15:49:17 <ushdf> functional code
15:49:26 <ushdf> it's valid PHP in the sense that it doesn't have bugs
15:49:31 <ushdf> for the time being, at least
15:49:32 <augustss> ushdf: doesn't make it Haskell
15:49:37 <ushdf> i realize
15:49:38 <ski_> ushdf : then maybe you'd be so kind as to explain the code ?
15:49:39 <vixey> it says
15:49:54 <SamB_irssi> Badger: well, the topic would be non-blank after it came back ...
15:49:59 <vixey> "I am the lazer viking"
15:50:03 <ushdf> well, there's a set of functions to navigate the tree
15:50:07 <SamB_irssi> wouldn't it ?
15:50:09 <ushdf> and post shit
15:50:13 <ushdf> and display shit! ;)
15:50:14 <Badger> possibly so.
15:50:25 <Badger> ushdf: now do it again in hs :P
15:50:29 <SamB_irssi> I didn't mean chanserv should have been in the channel -- just that it might have helped if the channel was registered
15:50:36 <Badger> ah
15:51:03 <ushdf> yeah, yeah
15:51:37 <chessguy> haha
15:51:37 <Badger> ushdf: well done. :P
15:51:43 <chessguy> way to scare off Macnara
15:52:06 <pumpkin> ack, I need to find out what protocol buffer type I receive at runtime :o
15:52:16 <pumpkin> but it expects me to tell it at compile time!
15:52:18 <pumpkin> (I think)
15:52:25 <pumpkin> there's some typable stuff going on though
15:54:04 <chessguy> @hoogle [] a
15:54:04 <lambdabot> Prelude repeat :: a -> [a]
15:54:04 <lambdabot> Data.List repeat :: a -> [a]
15:54:04 <lambdabot> Data.Foldable toList :: Foldable t => t a -> [a]
15:56:42 <Anchakor> hi, is there any format for haskell which is more suitable for generating?
15:57:19 <ski_> abstract syntax, possibly ?
15:58:08 <Anchakor> I don't know how is that called... I want something like this from a language for the first time :)
15:58:43 <dolio> ski_: Oh. Thinking further, your types are doubly negated. So they're positive, but not strictly positive.
15:59:05 <dolio> Those are still disallowed in the relevant languages, but I've never seen an encoding of omega in them.
15:59:33 <ski_> dolio : yes .. it's a bit like CPS
16:00:53 <chessguy> @type insertAll
16:00:54 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `insertAll'
16:01:52 <ski_> Anchakor : well, it's hard to answer sensibly if you can't elaborate more on what you are after
16:02:18 <knapr> so how will haskell get popular when neither webapps and guis is easy to make?
16:02:29 <ehird> troll?
16:02:34 <jeffz`> yeah.
16:02:36 <ehird> or just misguided? ... they are easy to make.
16:02:36 <knapr> thats kind of holding back the amaetur-makes-cool-shit
16:02:52 <ehird> yeah. leaning towards troll here. has he been in here before?
16:02:56 <HasMeta> Hey, could somebody give me a hint? -> http://rafb.net/p/TJIKGL52.html
16:03:13 <dolio> @protontorpedo
16:03:13 <lambdabot> what is the best absolute beginner utorial for haskell?
16:03:13 <chessguy> knapr, the goal of haskell is not to become popular
16:03:30 <HasMeta> line 9
16:03:32 <Anchakor> ski_: I need some alternate syntax which would make for example translating haskell to natural language easy
16:03:45 <vixey> I don't think calling people trolls is productive actually
16:03:54 <ehird> vixey: <jeffz`> same guy says stupid things every few days, different nick usually, from memory same ident and same isp tho.
16:03:58 <vixey> perhaps it is a topic for #haskell-blah or something
16:04:06 <vixey> yeah jeffz likes calling people trolls I am aware of that already
16:04:13 <ski_> Anchakor : i don't think tranlating anything into natural language is easy (apart from the identity translation)
16:04:16 <chessguy> HasMeta, why do you have a top-level definition in a let block?
16:04:17 <Anchakor> ski_: but I do not want such translator, though it would be nice for newbs :)
16:04:22 <jeffz`> eh, I said it in private rather than in #haskell for a reason
16:04:36 <ehird> vixey: I think coming in here day after day with a different nick, saying the same haskell "putdown" without evidence is troll behaviour
16:05:21 <HasMeta> chessguy: hmm, what exactly is a top-level definition?
16:05:25 <Anchakor> ski_: I need some easy to parse format
16:05:43 <ski_> Anchakor : easy to parse format for *what* ?
16:06:15 <kpreid> HasMeta: your do block at the top uses readFile, so it must be in IO, but it calls writeHtmlPageCss, which is in FilePeoducer
16:06:29 <chessguy> HasMeta, a definition that's not within the scope of another definition.
16:07:01 <Anchakor> ski_: ok, different approach - I need stripped down version of the syntax - universal one
16:07:13 <SamB_irssi> HasMeta: typically identified visually by it's starting at the very left of screen ;-)
16:07:19 <kpreid> HasMeta: I don't know what architecture you want but perhaps htmlbody needs a runWriter and runReader
16:07:22 <chessguy> maybe an easier way of defining it: a definition that can be exported/imported
16:07:22 <Plouj> hi
16:07:29 <Plouj> how do I use @check in my  own ghci?
16:07:36 <ddarius> @where goa
16:07:37 <lambdabot> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/goa/
16:07:43 <ski_> Anchakor : i still don't know *what* you want a syntax for
16:07:53 <Anchakor> ski_: for description of the objects of the language
16:08:02 <Plouj> ddarius: is that for me?
16:08:05 <ski_> which language ?
16:08:07 <ddarius> Plouj: Yes.
16:08:11 <Anchakor> ski_: haskell
16:08:15 <augustss> Anchakor: what objects?
16:08:26 <ddarius> Plouj: Though, just for quickcheck, you can just use the quickcheck library.
16:08:36 * ksf would like an sexpr syntax for haskell

16:26:18 <ksf> finally, gui's will be able to make you feel lost if you are lost ;)
16:26:18 <chessguy> int80_h, ok. sortBy takes 2 parameters. the first is a function which takes two elements of the same type and produces an Ordering, saying how they relate. the second parameter is a list of elements of the same type as the elements in the first parameter
16:26:19 <int80_h> mauke: I'm not really talking about sortBy as such. It's just an example to help me understand how to read type definitions
16:26:31 <Plouj> either I copied the algorithm wrong, or my tangent based sort is wrong
16:26:34 <chessguy> @src sort
16:26:34 <lambdabot> sort = sortBy compare
16:27:03 <Plouj> Draconx: I still don't get what you mean exactly

16:27:19 <lambdabot> Data.List sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
16:27:20 <chessguy> int80_h, so sortBy takes a function, which tells you how any _two_ elements compare to each other, and a list of elements, and uses the function to put the elements of the lsit in order
16:28:07 <conal> <conal> any denotational semantics fans here?  i've forgotten how to reason inductively on infinite structures.
16:28:20 <Phyx-> Hi, i was wondering which is to be prefered? H/Direct or FFI? is H/Direct still supported?
16:28:28 <chessguy> int80_h, i'm kind of shooting in the dark here, without really knowing what you don't understand. am i hitting anything?
16:28:43 <mauke> Phyx-: I don't even know what H/Direct is
16:29:12 <int80_h> chessguy: when I see something like this f(x) = y + 1. I have english words that can translate that into a sentence. That tells me I understand what the symbols mean.
16:29:12 <Philippa_> conal: was there some specific trick? I thought normally you use coinduction instead

16:30:14 <conal> Philippa_: thx.  i've forgotten coinduction, if i ever learned it.  now i know where to start.
16:30:22 <bodq> good one, idnar :)
16:30:26 * boing shaprs furiously
16:30:32 <int80_h> chessguy: well, I know certain type signatures. What has been introduced in RWH up to chapter 5. But it doesn't use the same notation
16:30:38 * bodq wanted to see if there's a correlation between chess and haskell
16:30:45 <chessguy> int80_h, sure it does
16:30:48 <idnar> bodq: I do play chess, as it turns out
16:30:50 <chessguy> @type map
16:30:51 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
16:30:52 <idnar> bodq: although not very frequently these days
16:31:01 <int80_h> what's ordering. it doesn't use that
16:31:01 <chessguy> int80_h,  do you understand that type signature?
16:31:13 <int80_h> hold on
16:31:14 <chessguy> Ordering is just some data type
16:31:17 <idnar> @src Ordering
16:31:17 <lambdabot> data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
16:31:20 <bodq> idnar: what's your elo ?
16:31:35 <chessguy> @src maybe
16:31:36 <lambdabot> maybe n _ Nothing  = n
16:31:36 <lambdabot> maybe _ f (Just x) = f x
16:31:39 <chessguy> @type maybe
16:31:40 <lambdabot> forall b a. b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
16:31:52 <kmeyer> @src Ord
16:31:53 <lambdabot> class  (Eq a) => Ord a  where
16:31:53 <lambdabot>     compare      :: a -> a -> Ordering
16:31:53 <lambdabot>     (<), (<=), (>), (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
16:31:53 <lambdabot>     max, min         :: a -> a -> a
16:31:53 <chessguy> you can have any arbitrary types in type signatures
16:32:23 <int80_h> chessguy: that type signature says that function takes a function (which takes input of some type a, returns some type b) and a list of some type a, returns a list of some type b
16:32:33 <idnar> bodq: dunno, but I'm rated 1421 on FICS
16:32:40 <chessguy> int80_h, yuppers
16:32:42 <Draconx> Plouj, you can compare angles of two points p_0 = (x_0, y_0), p_1 = (x_1, y_1) in 2-space by computing p_0 x p_1 = x_0y_1 - x_1y_0, provided that the two points lie in the same quadrant.
16:32:52 <chessguy> int80_h, now do the same thing with sortBy
16:32:55 <bodq> idnar: speed or slow?
16:32:55 <ddarius> Philippa: Fix point induction should work fine on infinite structures.
16:32:56 <chessguy> @type sortBy
16:32:56 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
16:33:10 <Draconx> Plouj, if points may lie in different quadrants, you will need to compare by quadrant first.
16:33:10 <ddarius> conal: If you really want induction you can look at the take lemma or the approximation lemma.
16:33:15 <idnar> bodq: that's for "standard", I'm not very font of blitz/lightning
16:33:15 <bodq> idnar: fics slow ratings are around +400 compared to fast
16:33:28 <bodq> idnar: oh congrats that's about my level :)
16:33:28 <idnar> bodq: er, very /fond/
16:33:29 <conal> ddarius: "fixpoint induction" is the term i was blanking on.
16:33:33 <chessguy> blitz chess sucks
16:33:47 <bodq> yeah
16:33:53 <bodq> although it's cool to see pros playing
16:34:06 <Plouj> Draconx: aah, that's the suck :)
16:34:07 <chessguy> like defecating on the real game
16:34:07 <idnar> bodq: I'm sure I was better back in high school, but I haven't played chess seriously for so long
16:34:20 <idnar> it's just slipped too far down on my list of interests
16:34:27 <bodq> eh
16:34:31 <Plouj> Draconx: Thanks. Subconsciously I was trying to avoid that.
16:34:39 <bodq> I found my mental capacity has increased since I started to play
16:34:44 <bodq> and then decreased since I stopped :)
16:34:56 * Philippa_ mostly figures blitz chess is a poor approximation of your fighting game of choice...
16:35:03 <idnar> Philippa_: haha
16:35:08 <pumpkin> @remember chessguy like defecating on the real game
16:35:08 <lambdabot> Done.
16:35:17 <pumpkin> yay context
16:35:17 <chessguy> uh
16:35:32 <chessguy> @forget chessguy like defecating on the real game
16:35:32 <lambdabot> Done.
16:35:35 <pumpkin> :(
16:35:41 <ksf> O(Go) > O(Chess)
16:35:53 <idnar> I want to learn Go sometime, but...
16:36:00 <chessguy> if you want to put it in context, i can only blame myself, but don't quote me out of context :)
16:36:05 <pumpkin> it has pretty simple rules
16:36:12 <idnar> my todo list seems to double in size every year, no matter how much I knock off the list
16:36:13 <pumpkin> but is awesomely complex
16:36:14 <ksf> it's mindboggingly simple, strategy is simple, too.
16:36:16 <int80_h> the first input value is a function that takes some type a, another value of type a, returns an Ordering. The second input is a list of type a. The end result is a list of type a
16:36:29 <ksf> the hard thing is to zen the current state of the board.
16:36:29 <bodq> Philippa: HADOUKEN!
16:36:48 <chessguy> int80_h, there ya go!
16:36:53 <idnar> chessguy: but taking quotes out of context is where the fun is at!

16:38:29 <ddarius> pumpkin: Aim lower.
16:38:41 * pumpkin hits dons
16:39:00 <Philippa_> I'd ask what with, but that'd risk carrying context from -blah :-)
16:39:10 * bodq has found wives to be hopeless at chess
16:39:22 * koeien prefers Go
16:39:34 * cjb thinks bodq hasn't married Alexandra Kosteniuk yet
16:39:37 <idnar> hmm, I must still finish reading RWH
16:39:44 <idnar> cjb: hahaha

16:40:11 <cjb> ever watched Hikaru no Go?
16:40:23 <Philippa_> bodq: I'm definitely better at SF2, but I haven't played since I was a teenager and there wasn't much opposition around
16:40:24 <dolio> Lol, girls can't do math! Amirite, Philippa_?!
16:40:25 <cjb> it's an entire anime series about a Go hero
16:40:28 <cjb> beat that :)
16:40:35 <bodq> cjb: no, only Tonari no Totoro :)
16:40:36 <Philippa_> dolio: yeah, let's go shopping!
16:40:51 <int80_h> I don't know what this means "forall b a. (Ord a) => ..."
16:41:01 <bodq> ok I know
16:41:20 <idnar> int80_h: (Ord a) is a type constraint; it says that a can't just be /any/ type, there has to be an instance Ord a
16:41:34 <bodq> go is all about this japanese fad (although it's chinese)
16:41:51 <idnar> int80_h: you could read that as "for all types b, and all types a (such that Ord a): ..."
16:42:04 <int80_h> idnar, thanks :)
16:42:08 <bodq> at some point the japanese fad will go away and there will go Go

16:42:22 <mle> ...go is alive and well.
16:42:29 <cjb> bodq: Japan is weaker than China and Korea at Go.
16:42:41 <cjb> has been for at least a decade.
16:42:59 <bodq> cjb: what I mean that there's a certain fascination with oriental culture in the west
16:43:18 <bodq> cjb: and I think popularity of Go is largely a consequence
16:43:23 <lamente> go is not popular in the west.
16:43:23 <bodq> cjb: but I might be wrong
16:43:28 <lamente> go is popular in the east.
16:43:30 <cjb> yeah, you're wrong :)
16:43:30 <koeien> go is not popular in western europe
16:43:37 <bodq> eh
16:43:37 <SubStack> yet
16:43:43 <cjb> go is many, many times more popular in East Asia than in the rest of the world combined
16:43:47 <mle> bodq: largely independent sets from what I see
16:43:51 <bodq> where I work, there's a go players club but not a chess player club
16:43:53 <Philippa_> it's a starting point, but honestly? My interest's got more to do with the game itself
16:43:58 <cjb> in fact, it is very hard to get good at Go as a westener
16:44:05 <Philippa_> (I've concluded that I don't have the time to do it justice, sadly)
16:44:06 <lamente> bodq: where do you live?
16:44:09 <cjb> precisely because the strong east asian players aren't writing books about it in English
16:44:13 <bodq> lamente: .ch
16:44:14 <cjb> so we don't have access to their research
16:44:25 <lamente> bodq: are there a lot of chinese immigrants or something?
16:44:31 <bodq> lamente: what? no
16:44:36 <lamente> cool
16:44:47 <bodq> lamente: .ch = switzerland
16:44:54 <koeien> .cn = china :)
16:45:04 <lamente> why are you telling me this? :\
16:45:05 <idnar> cjb: pfft, just learn to read Chinese; how hard could it be?! ;)
16:45:07 <bodq> > 'h' == 'n' -- ?
16:45:09 <lambdabot>   False
16:45:15 <mle> yes, some of us played where in europe is carmen sandiego
16:45:20 <cjb> idnar: I can read "white to kill" and "black to make ko" and so on :)
16:45:27 <idnar> bodq: there wouldn't be many chinese /immigrants/ in china
16:45:44 <bodq> idnar: which only makes matters more confusing :)
16:46:06 <bodq> idnar: imagine a political system where you're an expat in your own coutry
16:46:15 <Taejo> @pl \x->if p x then f x else
16:46:15 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 25):
16:46:17 <lambdabot> unexpected end of input
16:46:18 <lamente> obviously you guys do a lot of drugs

16:46:19 <lambdabot> expecting end of "else", lambda abstraction or expression
16:46:19 <idnar> bodq: you said there was a go club but not a chess club; it doesn't seem completely unreasonable to wonder whether there are a lot of chinese around
16:46:20 <Philippa_> idnar: it's possible, though
16:46:23 <lambdabot> join (liftM2 if' p f)
16:46:30 * dolio imagines that.
16:46:34 <idnar> Philippa_: sure
16:46:35 <Taejo> @pl \p f x->if p x then f x else x
16:46:37 <lambdabot> flip flip id . (ap .) . liftM2 if'
16:46:39 <lamente> here the go clubs are populated almost entirely by chinese immigrants
16:46:45 <bodq> idnar: I never said anyone was unreasonable. just amusing
16:46:57 <cjb> here the chinese people boycott the local go club, dunno why :)
16:47:00 <koeien> here the go clubs are populated almost entirely by mathematicians :/
16:47:05 <ushdf> ?
16:47:07 <lamente> koeien: do they suck?

16:47:15 <ushdf> http://128.230.216.163/tree/index.php?trace=239
16:47:20 <lamente> the problem with the chinese people is that they're really really good
16:47:21 <koeien> 7kyu
16:47:22 <cjb> lamente: all westerners suck
16:47:34 <lamente> cjb: eh, not really
16:47:34 <cjb> the few westerners who don't tend to have moved to Asia in order to not suck
16:47:46 <tromp__> james kerwin doesn't suck...
16:47:49 <lamente> not pro level != doesn't suck
16:47:54 <lamente> even ignoring the pros
16:47:54 <cjb> tromp__: .. moved to Japan!
16:47:55 <tromp__> nor does michael redmond
16:47:57 <blackh> Here I *am* the local go club.
16:47:58 <lamente> (shikshina... is hot!)
16:47:59 <tromp__> true
16:48:15 <cjb> this was my point.
16:48:40 <cjb> it's not possible to bootstrap yourself into becoming an Asian-level pro, and the knowledge doesn't exist to faciliate doing it over here
16:48:47 <bodq> @remember cjb lamente: all westerners suck
16:48:47 <lambdabot> Done.

16:49:32 <lamente> obviously we have a different definition of 'suck'
16:49:48 <int80_h> can we talk about the type signature of comparing?
16:49:48 <lamente> to me, high amateur dans clearly don't suck in any meaningful way
16:49:48 <cjb> tromp__: sure, I'm already a dan player.  I just think that still sucks.  :)
16:49:58 <int80_h> does this say comparing takes three arguments?
16:50:02 <bodq> lamente: let's not go there
16:50:11 <int80_h> the first being a function, the last two being of some type b?
16:50:14 <Taejo> int80_h, yes
16:50:15 <koeien> int80_h: yes
16:50:19 <koeien> int80_h: right
16:50:24 <int80_h> okay, then why does this work?

16:50:39 <koeien> int80_h: the function says how to compare the two
16:50:40 <int80_h> comparing is only taking *one* argument.
16:50:50 <koeien> int80_h: you are right. this is partial application
16:50:58 <bodq> int80_h: the keyword is currying
16:51:26 <int80_h> ah, I don't understand partial application I think
16:51:29 <koeien> int80_h: i.e. if    f x y = x + y, and f :: Int -> Int -> Int, then (f 37) :: Int -> Int
16:51:30 <bodq> int80_h: I don't want to seem rude, but this is explained in every haskell tutorial I read
16:51:55 <cjb> hm, I remember a particularly useful explanation of currying
16:52:05 <int80_h> bodq: yeah, I didn't like the RWH explaination. Maybe I should go back to YAHT
16:52:11 <Taejo> bodq, if you don't want to seem rude, don't be. other people are happy to explain, or point to an explanation
16:52:21 <bodq> int80_h: learnyouahaskell is good
16:52:35 <int80_h> cjb: where is your good explaination?
16:52:49 <cjb> int80_h: I'm not sure :/
16:53:00 <int80_h> okay, off to learnyouahaskell
16:53:02 <bodq> int80_h: http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#curried-functions
16:53:10 <cjb> it wasn't YAHT, it was a web page tutorial, not LYAH either.  But I imagine LYAH's explanation is good.

16:53:23 <int80_h> LYAH?
16:53:29 <cjb> learnyouahaskell
16:53:30 <int80_h> ah nevermind
16:53:59 <bodq> LYAH is so good. who wrote it? I want their authograph
16:54:01 <koeien> int80_h, bodq: the website that bodq pointed to is really good
16:54:13 <int80_h> I'm pausing my work in RWH to learn some idiomatic haskell
16:54:17 <cjb> bodq: BONUS_did
16:54:22 <cjb> BONUS_ did, rather
16:54:34 <bodq> BONUS_: you're my hero for that :)
16:54:36 <int80_h> chessguy suggested I should write the graham scan algorithm in idiomatic haskell
16:54:54 <pumpkin> eww idiomatic haskell!
16:55:04 <pumpkin> I much prefer doing everything in main using IORefs
16:55:24 <int80_h> I think haskell is better when it looks like fortran. or logo

16:55:35 <lambdabot> *
16:55:36 <sjanssen> @remember pumpkin I much prefer doing everything in main using IORefs
16:55:37 <lambdabot> It is forever etched in my memory.
16:55:46 <koeien> i always start my haskell programs with a FORTRAN interpreter
16:55:46 <pumpkin> :)
16:56:36 <Olathe> What is (.) called ?
16:56:41 <Olathe> Ahh, composition.
16:56:43 <bodq> why doesn't lambdabot have a sensible help page? it is intended as a barrier of entry?
16:57:02 <ksf> conal, do I guess right if I guess that introducing MonadFix instance to reactive fixes ISO standard leaks in the same way as Yampa did?
16:57:03 <bodq> like, you have to read modules' code to understand what they do and how to use them
16:57:15 <Taejo> bodq, because you haven't written one yet?
16:57:29 <bodq> Taejo: i.e. no reason? :)
16:57:57 <bodq> Taejo: not that I complain or anything
16:58:33 <Taejo> I don't think there is a reason... whenever I want \bot help, I wish for a moment it existed, and then just ask
16:58:59 <pumpkin> bodq: I think it's mostly because people don't like to write documentation :P
16:59:15 <int80_h> pumpkin: I'll do the docs. I just need to understand first
16:59:22 <pumpkin> yay
16:59:23 <bodq> pumpkin: it was that obvious, eh? :)
16:59:52 <bodq> I will understand. I just need the docs first
17:01:07 <conal> ksf: ISO?
17:02:21 <ksf> conal, http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/ISO-standard-cup-of-tea.html
17:02:51 <conal> oh .....
17:02:55 <BMeph> bodq, cjb: Xiangqi is popular at my place of work.
17:03:36 <bodq> BMeph: wow, really? where is that?
17:03:51 <conal> ksf: i don't know how to translate the yampa leak fix to reactive.
17:03:53 <cjb> German board games are popular at my place of work :)
17:04:11 <bodq> German drinking games are popular at my place of work :) :)
17:04:13 <Taejo> wow, there really *is* an ISO standard for making tea!
17:04:19 <ksf> it just came to my mind as it's based on fixpoints.
17:04:35 <BMeph> San Diego. Well, Poway, techically, so call it "Metro San Diego". Or "Tijuana Norte." ;)
17:04:43 <conal> ksf: on the other hand, reactive leans more toward a data representation than previous classic-frp (non-arrow) implementations, which i suspect also helps.
17:04:45 <lamente> cjb: have you failed to subvert them into switching to go?
17:04:54 <ksf> there's only one drinking game i know of.
17:05:04 <ksf> it's called the Schilderspiel (Sign game)
17:05:12 <lamente> strip russian roulette probably qualifies as a drinking game, in that you wouldn't play it sober
17:05:17 <cjb> lamente: I think most of them have tried 9x9 by now, but none very strong
17:05:30 <BMeph> bodq: German drinking games are popular at most places of work...well, except for the top management. ;)
17:05:33 <ksf> rules are simple: You walk through the city in a group, drinking at each traffic sign.
17:05:48 * BMeph misses playing Terrace
17:06:00 <lamente> i made a terrace board and tried playing it once
17:06:07 <lamente> i didn't get it :)
17:06:14 <BMeph> ksf: Sounds like the perfect game for Portland. :)
17:06:30 <gwern> 9x9 is fun for go. it makes tengen the best move, which leads to interesting games
17:06:42 <Taejo> ksf, sounds like everybody drinks the same amount... so no winners and losers... could be a good or a bad thing
17:06:53 <bodq> terrace :) that's like star trek 3d chess?
17:07:12 <cjb> gwern: you mean tengen isn't the best move on 19x19?  ;-)
17:07:15 <idnar> Taejo: the winner is the guy left standing :P
17:07:25 <ksf> it's definitely the right game for germany, it's impossible to stand at one sign and not see at least 10 others.
17:07:25 <gwern> cjb: now now let's not get into that :)
17:07:26 <lamente> and then you accidentally walk in here http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11573398/Traffic_Signs.jpg
17:07:47 <lamente> tengen is obviously the best move
17:07:51 <lamente> the question is, for W or B? :)
17:08:04 <cjb> 5-5, tengen, 5-5?  :)

17:08:19 <Taejo> do you drink extra for the sign (in Austria) "Fucking. Bitte, nicht so schnell."?
17:08:50 <tromp__> tengen is best even on an infinite board
17:08:51 * gwern didn't realize I'd fallen in among tengeners!
17:09:02 * cjb high-fives tromp_.
17:09:20 <gwern> tromp__: on an infinite board isn't every point tengen?
17:09:28 <tromp__> it's a joke:)
17:09:35 <cjb> gwern: don't confuse us with facts like that
17:09:40 <lamente> tengent is the only urgent move, all others are miai
17:09:44 <lamente> -t :)
17:10:11 <idnar> is tengent a cross between tengen and tangent?
17:10:19 <gwern> (hm, terrace is surprisingly challenging to loo up)
17:10:32 <lamente> terrace star trek
17:10:50 <lamente> the problem with terrace, unlike go, is that nobody seriously worked on developing the strategy
17:10:54 <lamente> so you're mostly on your own
17:11:14 <lamente> i suppose that's more enjoyable to some people
17:12:50 <gwern> (the rules do sound fairly simple as WP describes them, but not as simple as go)
17:14:45 <lamente> i'm nowhere near being a good go player, but i can imagine how horrible i'd be if i haven't read any books and haven't played stronger players
17:14:54 <lamente> 29k or such
17:14:55 <BMeph> gwern: Go only has one type of piece. You're going to be hard-pressed to have a game with simpler rules, just because of that. ANYWAY... ;)
17:15:26 <lamente> if you play terrace, you'd be 29k at terrace...
17:15:29 <gwern> BMeph: it'd be interesting to try to come up with a simpler game, I think
17:15:43 <lamente> gwern: no useful metric for simplicity
17:15:54 <tromp__> sure, length og haskell program for the rules
17:16:14 <lamente> :P
17:16:35 <lamente> Tromp rules don't count :P
17:16:39 <gwern> tromp__: but that a shorter program doesn't exist is undecidable, iirc kolmogorov complexity in general is undecidable
17:16:50 <tromp__> well, u get upperbound
17:17:59 <BMeph> tromp: Your program for Go is pretty wordy, though, so you kind of open the door with that metric. ;)
17:18:50 <BMeph> I think I'll go with lamente's analysis. :)
17:18:54 <Taejo> gwern, but that doesn't mean approximations to kolmogorov complexity are bad metrics
17:19:26 <lamente> anyway, rock/paper/scissors is simpler.
17:19:48 <SamB_irssi> I thought go had two kinds of pieces
17:19:52 <Taejo> rock/paper is even simpler
17:19:53 <tromp__> but less fun to watch 2 professionals play that::)
17:20:06 <tromp__> one kind, two colors
17:20:11 <lamente> SamB_irssi: go has three kinds of pieces, black, white, and empty
17:20:17 <lamente> oh, and ko square
17:20:19 <lamente> four kinds :)
17:20:20 <gio123> @seen Cale
17:20:21 <lambdabot> Cale is in #haskell, #haskell-overflow and #ghc. I last heard Cale speak 1h 3m 14s ago.
17:20:33 <gwern> Taejo: well, it's certainly better than any other metric I know of
17:21:04 <tromp__> i once tried to measure complexity of tetris that way:)
17:21:05 <gio123> @seen ski_
17:21:05 <lambdabot> ski_ is in ##logic and #haskell. I last heard ski_ speak 59m 18s ago.
17:21:05 <lamente> Taejo: PAPER!!!
17:21:21 <Taejo> the undecidability of Kolmogorov complexity is essentially the full-employment theorem for optimizing-compiler writers
17:21:56 <SamB_irssi> Taejo: well, there are also always more programs we want them to optimize ...
17:22:43 <Taejo> SamB_irssi, there are always more strings we want to find the Kolmogorov complexity of :)
17:28:50 <kapil> if one defines 'choose n r' as 'div (fac n) ((fac r)*(fac n-r))' and (say) 10 is less than n and r, then will ghc compute 'fac 10' twice or will it be able to optimise and compute it only once?
17:29:32 <gwern> ghc doesn't auto-memoize like that does it?
17:30:08 <Taejo> no, you won't get any memoisation in that case
17:30:48 * kapil should remember to use pl phrases like 'memoise'
17:30:51 <idnar> heh
17:30:53 <akillah> hi, I'm having troubles with UTF-8 output using Text.XHtml. I'm getting the the text in CP1250 encoding, converting it to UTF-8 using "makeUtf =  B.unpack . recode CP1250 UTF8 . B.pack" but the only way to get it out ungarbled is using the primHtml method. i know that GHC strings are not encoded in UTF8, but don't know hot to convert to the internal representation
17:31:04 <sjanssen> kapil: this depends on the definition of 'fac'
17:31:48 <sjanssen> facs = scanl (*) 1 [1 ..]; fac n = facs !! n -- will exhibit sharing
17:31:50 <Gracenotes> kapil: you could change the algorithm so that it "performs" division, using: product [range start..range end]
17:32:20 <Gracenotes> i.e. cancel out terms both in the denom and numerator
17:32:36 <kapil> sjanssen: i thought that since expressions are supposed to always have the same value, memoisation should be the default.
17:32:51 <glguy> akillah, Haskell strings are lists of unicode codepoints
17:32:59 <idnar> kapil: that would be a pretty massive space leak in general
17:33:00 <Taejo> kapil, it is, on architectures with infinite memory
17:33:03 <akillah> glguy: i know
17:33:14 <idnar> kapil: your program's memory consumption would never decrease
17:33:20 <glguy> akillah, so you don't want UTF-8
17:33:30 <akillah> glguy: what i don't know is : how to convert to the internal rep.
17:33:41 <kapil> Gracenotes: that is specific to factorial. my question was really about memo-isation.
17:33:52 <Gracenotes> ah.
17:34:21 <akillah> glguy: only workaround i know is forcing it out explicitly using primHtml :-(
17:34:26 <glguy> kapil, you'd have to keep track of all of the expressions evaluated to automatically memoize
17:34:49 <glguy> kapil, since you'd never know when something might be needed again
17:35:11 <akillah> glguy: can Data.Encoding do what I neew ?
17:35:17 <Gracenotes> it might be useful to have a specific function memoize
17:35:21 <kapil> idnar, Taejo: i thought the way "thunk"s would be used would be to replace thunks with values whenever the evaluation takes place.
17:35:34 <akillah> neew -> need
17:36:28 <glguy> akillah, you'd probably just use the decode function from Data.Encoding
17:36:45 <glguy> akillah, which would take your bytestring of cp1250 encoded text, and give you a String
17:36:45 <kapil> glguy: gc should take care of that. unless the expression is referred to it would be "lost".
17:36:57 <Taejo> kapil, yes, but functions make a new thunk every time they are called
17:37:24 <glguy> kapil, in the general case, this behavior would  be slow and use lots of memory
17:37:39 <glguy> so we use libraries like memotrie for when we want it in specific cases
17:37:39 <akillah> glguy: i'll try, brb.
17:38:24 <pumpkin> :t forM_
17:38:25 <lambdabot> forall a (m :: * -> *) b. (Monad m) => [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m ()
17:38:27 <Philonous> I guess you could implement fancy stuff that reduces static expressions or do run time analysis. But this would be expensive at compile time and expensive to implement and the gains would prolly be marginal
17:38:37 <kapil> i see. so i need to fix some notes i wrote --- i just assumed that this was how it worked! clearly i was wrong.
17:39:29 <akillah> glguy: yay, that was it, thanks a lot.
17:44:02 <akillah> but the output of Text.Xhtml is not exactly nice, it's full of ugly trigraphs. does somebody know how to tell it to output some specific codepage ?
17:46:01 * kapil has fixed his erroneous notes ... still learning the difference between mathematics and "real world" computing!
17:46:25 <Cale> Oh, is this with regard to memoisation?
17:47:00 <Cale> Yeah, in the real world, you have to worry about space as well as time :)
17:47:45 <kapil> trying to lecture on mathematics (category theory) and programming (haskell) in one course --- while learning the latter!
17:47:51 <Cale> ah
17:48:52 <sbahra> Sounds like an interesting class, kapil.
17:49:00 <sbahra> kapil, it would be great if you could share your lecture slides/notes/etc...
17:49:03 <Cale> Yeah, there are also some subtle differences when you worry about strictness (which we sometimes choose to ignore when thinking categorically).
17:49:35 <kapil> some (very) preliminary notes are at pointed to by my user page on haskell.org
17:49:52 <sbahra> kapil, and where is that?
17:50:00 <kapil> ^s/at//
17:50:38 <kapil> http://www.imsc.res.in/IMScWiki/Haskell_Course (not really usable as a wiki from outside our LAN)
17:51:02 <sbahra> works fine for me
17:51:25 <chessguy_work> int80_h, how goes?
17:51:56 <kapil> comments (esp. criticism!) by e-mail or here on irc are welcome always
17:52:51 <koeien> kapil: did you look at the text of Barr & Wells?
17:53:03 <kapil> sbahra: "not usable a wiki" as in "not editable" (i think!)
17:54:03 <Cale> One thing which is slightly troublesome about Hask is that it has no initial object. Even the seemingly "empty" type: data Void has a member -- namely 'undefined', which means that maps from it are not unique.
17:54:34 <chessguy_work> Cale, doesn't cause me to lose any sleep at night
17:54:37 * chessguy_work shrugs
17:54:39 <gio123> Cale: hi
17:54:43 <Cale> gio123: hi
17:55:41 <koeien> Cale: there are also 2 maps to Void right? const undefined and undefined
17:56:00 <Cale> koeien: yes, that's another, perhaps even more annoying thing.
17:56:29 <Cale> So it's not even properly terminal.
17:56:34 <Cale> (because of seq)
17:56:40 <koeien> yep
17:57:30 <chessguy> kapil, what is your intended audience for that course?
17:57:38 <idnar> naughty Hask
17:58:12 <chessguy> mean, awful, TERRIBLE naughty Hask
17:58:16 <idnar> @type const undefined
17:58:17 <lambdabot> forall a b. b -> a
17:58:24 <idnar> @type undefined
17:58:25 <lambdabot> forall a. a
17:58:43 <idnar> > const undefined `seq` 5
17:58:44 <lambdabot>   5
17:58:49 <idnar> ah, of course
17:59:09 <kapil> chessguy: mostly mathematics students but also some from tcs and tphysics.
17:59:22 <Cale> t?
17:59:24 <chessguy> oh ok
17:59:33 <Cale> Theoretical?
17:59:48 <kapil> yes.
17:59:55 <Cale> kapil: What textbook are you using?
18:00:33 <Cale> My new favourite intro to category theory is Awodey's fairly recent text.
18:01:12 <byorgey> Cale: link?
18:01:13 <kapil> i find it hard to follow a text while teaching a course. (my students hate me for this).
18:01:20 <byorgey> Cale: what do you like about it?
18:01:30 <kapil> i prefer to type my own notes as i go along.
18:01:44 <Cale> byorgey: http://cale.yi.org/share/Category%20Theory%20-%20S.%20Awodey%20(Clarendon,%202006)%20WW.pdf
18:01:56 <Cale> I apologise in advance for any slowness, I'm on a torrent.
18:02:14 <idnar> BitCAle
18:02:28 <kmeyer> anyone written a haskell bittorrent library? :D
18:02:38 <gwern> kmeyer: better, we've an app
18:02:43 <kmeyer> oh yeah?
18:02:50 <gwern> YAH
18:02:59 <gwern> Cale: what is good about that text?
18:03:01 <Cale> Well, one thing I particularly like about it is that it has a really nice coherent treatment of Yoneda's Lemma.
18:03:03 <idnar> bleh
18:03:19 <idnar> most bittorrent implementations don't have comparable performance to Azureus/Vuze/uTorrent
18:03:24 <gwern> hm, evince doesn't like that pdf
18:03:34 <Cale> gwern: It does here.
18:03:35 * gwern will try xpdf
18:03:46 <idnar> (for one reason or another)
18:03:46 <Cale> idnar: I use Deluge.
18:04:05 <kmeyer> idnar: rtorrent :)
18:04:07 <Cale> idnar: But the recent versions of Deluge have sucked. I use 0.5.x
18:04:08 <idnar> the most common issue seems to be poor or nonexistent multi-tracker support
18:04:19 <idnar> (rtorrent/libtorrent falls into that category, for example)
18:04:24 <gwern> nop, xpdf doesn't like it either
18:04:33 <kmeyer> gwern: sure you got all of it?
18:04:34 <Cale> gwern: Try downloading it again perhaps.
18:04:43 <koeien> 3 kB/s :(
18:04:47 <kapil> thanks for the pointers everyone.
18:04:52 <gwern> ah wait, it hadn't finished downloading
18:04:53 <kmeyer> evince likes it here
18:04:55 <gwern> that'd explain it
18:04:56 <byorgey> gwern: the same thing just happened to me, and then I realized that I was trying to open it before it finished downloading =P
18:05:00 <byorgey> hehe, yup
18:05:12 <gwern> kmeyer: the app is called conjure, there's an Int related bug in it if you'd like to hack on't
18:05:15 <Cale> Another good thing about Awodey's text is that it has almost no prerequisites.
18:05:34 <Cale> It develops the most important examples of categories internally to the book.
18:05:44 <byorgey> Cale: excellent, this looks great.
18:05:44 <gwern> Cale: indeed? it is suitable for a math noob like myself?
18:05:48 * gwern is a simpleton
18:05:57 <kmeyer> gwern: is Int 64-bit on 64-bit cpus?
18:06:05 <byorgey> I've organized a CT reading group, we're using the Barr & Wells lecture notes
18:06:09 <Cale> gwern: It might do... at least as far as category theory texts go, it should be as comprehensible to you as possible.
18:06:25 <byorgey> but this looks like it will be a good source of extra info, clarification, etc.
18:06:47 <Cale> I really like the approach it takes to categories as a sort of cross between preorders and monoids.
18:06:47 <koeien> byorgey: TTT or the 1999 text?
18:06:55 <gwern> kmeyer: yes, but the issue is that using Int restricts how large a file can be done
18:07:01 <koeien> byorgey: or the "condensation" of the 1999 text?
18:07:06 <gwern> kmeyer: I forget whether the problem occurs on 64-bit as well
18:07:28 <byorgey> koeien: uh, I think it's the "condensation"
18:07:30 * koeien is looking for a good intro in CT as well
18:07:31 <byorgey> I'm not sure though
18:07:34 <kmeyer> gwern: well, I'm saying it shouldn't be an issue on 64-bit platforms :D
18:07:53 <gwern> test and see
18:08:59 <BMeph> gwern: It loads fine in Google Chrome. ;)
18:09:10 <Cale> Oh, some other things which are cool about it...
18:09:19 <pumpkin> I've just noticed how big ghc's output is :o
18:09:28 <Cale> It has sections on the lambda calculus as well as a good amount about categorical logic.
18:09:32 <sbahra> Is there a nice pretty printer out there for binary trees?
18:09:43 <pumpkin> there's one built into Data.Map iirc
18:09:43 <BMeph> koeien, byorgey: Is it a "condensation," or a "condescension"? ;p
18:09:52 <sbahra> pumpkin, oh? :/
18:09:56 <byorgey> BMeph: hehe
18:10:20 <sbahra> showTree
18:10:40 <chessguy> sbahra, you can convert to Data.Tree

18:12:06 <skorpan> why is the source not available?
18:13:04 <ksf> because lambdabot's desk is a mess and she can't find it?
18:13:16 <koeien> Cale: thanks for this text! I'll be sure to read at least part of it
18:13:36 <multiholle> i'm using gtk2hs. how can i deactivate the "onExpose", "onButtonPree", .... events depending on the state of my program?
18:13:38 <skorpan> but the source isn't even available at hoogle
18:13:55 <Gracenotes> skorpan: enjoy.
18:13:57 <Gracenotes> http://haskell.pastebin.com/d17e67bd9
18:14:23 <skorpan> that's great, but it's been bugging me quite a bit lately that the source code isn't always available. why isn't it?

18:16:44 <chessguy> BMeph, DS?
18:17:42 <akillah> is there a possibility to tell Text.Xhtml that i want a specific output encoding instead of text liberally sprinkled with trigraphs ?
18:18:18 <sjanssen> BMeph: for constructing the code, you should use a min-heap of trees
18:18:18 <akillah> i've searched [what feels like] half of the web and havent discovered one
18:19:37 <multiholle> can't i tell the window to ignore the events?
18:23:33 <BMeph> chessguy: DS: Data Structure.
18:23:43 <chessguy> ah
18:23:51 <BMeph> sjanssen: And for storing one? :)
18:24:00 <chessguy> sorry, that just went totally over my head
18:24:34 <sjanssen> BMeph: I've been thinking about this for a few minutes
18:24:34 <BMeph> sjanssen: Let me check what-the-heck I'm trying to do again, and I'll give a better answer... ;p
18:25:01 <sjanssen> seems like there should be a structure that lets you treat your input stream as bytes rather than bits
18:27:37 <chrisdone> anyonw know where mmorrow's javascript quasiquoter is?
18:32:06 * chessguy spends several minutes why he can't run haskell code in codepad, until he realizes he didn't switch to haskell mode...
18:32:14 <pumpkin> :)
18:34:42 * byorgey makes lambda mojitos
18:35:28 <mmorrow> chrisdone: perfect timing! http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/
18:36:00 <mmorrow> hmm, that pkg actually probably deps on the old haskell-src-exts, lemme see
18:36:03 <BMeph> sjanssen: Hmm, I guess that's it, then; I'm looking at the paper that does JPEG-making in Gofer.
18:36:50 * stepcut has read that paper
18:37:04 <pumpkin> what does a js qq do?
18:37:13 <dolio> Quasiquotes javascript.
18:37:21 <mmorrow> chrisdone: yeah it does, but all that stuff can be replaced by a haskell-src-meta dep. i'll do that real quick now.
18:37:29 <pumpkin> I can see that :P
18:37:43 <mmorrow> pumpkin: it lets you build javascript and splice in other javascript with a QuasiQuoter
18:37:45 <dolio> Then why did you ask? :)
18:38:02 <pumpkin> I didn't really get what it actually did with the js
18:38:12 <mmorrow> pumpkin: here a "demo" http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/WebUi.hs.html
18:38:43 <pumpkin> just looking now, thanks :)
18:38:45 <mmorrow> hmm, i guess i should've put up the generated .html as well...
18:39:02 * mmorrow tries to find it since he doesn't have js-qq installed now
18:39:20 <pumpkin> not on cabal ? :o
18:39:27 <mmorrow> i think so
18:39:37 <mmorrow> http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/js-qq/
18:39:44 <mmorrow> that's the caballed darcs repo
18:39:50 <pumpkin> I meant on hackage, sorry :)
18:39:55 <mmorrow> lemme fix it though to not use old haskell-src-exts
18:40:15 <mmorrow> pumpkin: no, but now that ghc-6.10 is out i should upload it
18:40:24 <pumpkin> cool
18:41:10 <mmorrow> (also, unfortunately by necessity it uses a modified WebBits (~20 lines added) pkg, which may be a pain for hackage
18:41:11 <mmorrow> )
18:41:24 <mmorrow> i'd have to include the entire modified WebBits i guess
18:41:29 <pumpkin> ah
18:41:36 <pumpkin> can't you just submit the mods to the maintainer?
18:42:00 <chrisdone> mmorrow: how do you appear from nowhere when I mention your name?
18:42:03 <mmorrow> i suppose, but i'm adding a non-javascript-standard thing to the parser
18:42:09 <mmorrow> dunno how that would go over
18:42:10 <chrisdone> I mean, it's cool to have a genie, but
18:42:45 <mmorrow> chrisdone: hold on, lemme find my magic carpet
18:43:43 <chrisdone> magic mouse mat
18:44:32 <mmorrow> crap, it's in the shop
18:44:38 <chrisdone> I'm experimenting with inserting javascript into formlets for client-side validation
18:44:53 <mmorrow> chrisdone: cool!
18:44:54 <chrisdone> I'm pretty sure you could use formlets with Gtk or curses
18:44:58 <chrisdone> it's just that general
18:45:58 <mmorrow> chrisdon: formlets looks great. i haven't gotten to the don't-have-to-think-about-how-to-do-stuff-with-them stage yet, but i want to
18:45:58 <chrisdone> http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/js-qq/ <- this sorted now?
18:46:12 <mmorrow> no not yet, starting now
18:46:21 <chrisdone> thanks, pet
18:46:30 <mmorrow> :)
18:46:42 <chrisdone> I was looking at  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HJScript and http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HJavaScript
18:46:44 <chrisdone> but I dunno
18:47:56 <stepcut> where can I find that study where they had different programmers implement the same problem in a different languages, and they found that functional programmers tended to be fast, and java programmers had a huge variation in time and lines of code?
18:48:22 <chrisdone> mmorrow: do you use the jsqq at work?
18:48:50 <mmorrow> chrisdone: i have once or twice, but haven't used it really at all recently
18:48:50 <Philonous> stepcut: the "great language shootout" ? http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/
18:49:11 <mmorrow> chrisdone: but i'd love to start again
18:49:37 <mmorrow> chrisdone: ah yeah, HJavaScript and that other one
18:49:41 <Philonous> stepcut: Never mind, I think I know what you mean, but I dunno where it is
18:49:47 <mmorrow> also, there's hjs, an js interp
18:50:12 <stepcut> Philonous: yeah, it was a study not the shootout
18:51:08 <mjb> stepcut: This seems to have real references in it: http://forums.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2008/03/27/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-quot-10x-quot.aspx
18:51:14 <mmorrow> my plan with this (which has been on hold (until maybe now!)) was to write a js parser so i didn't need to dep on WebBits, and to have a (at some level of functionality) js interpreter, so the QQ could do partial eval/simplification
18:51:34 <chrisdone> mmorrow: the two above seem similar to Text.XHtml in terms of being a first class EDSL and the not-requiring-TH factor, and validating functions will probably be small, but it's hard to tell if it'll just be a pain in the ass compared to QQ'd
18:52:35 <pumpkin> does the shootout just not run haskell versions with +RTS -N4 ?
18:52:36 <mmorrow> well the QQ can do the exact same stuff (assuming the code's been written), but the diff is that is lets you code it in js rather than as verbose haskell data
18:52:41 <stepcut> mjb: thanks
18:52:48 <pumpkin> programs that are parallel still seem to only use one CPU
18:52:53 <chrisdone> mmorrow: yeah
18:53:02 <Axman6> mmorrow: about that Mach-O parser thing, i think you're right about it being erikc
18:53:10 <mmorrow> chrisdone: so in theory, HJavaScript could be layered on top of the QQ
18:53:30 <chrisdone> underneath the QQ?
18:53:31 <mjb> stepcut: Good description there, but not the exact study you're looking for.
18:53:47 <mmorrow> the only tough part is, the GADTs and parsing the code from a String
18:53:53 <mmorrow> since we don't have dependent types
18:54:04 <chrisdone> mmorrow: you mean quasiquoted source becomes HJavaScript data structures?
18:54:22 <mmorrow> chrisdone: yes! (but unfortunately we couldn't use a GADT)
18:55:00 <mmorrow> hmm, maybe somehow... i don't recall exactly the problem i had with this
18:55:03 <chrisdone> could it merely produce a string?
18:55:13 <mmorrow> what?
18:55:27 <mmorrow> (could what produce a String?)
18:55:43 <chrisdone> the quasiquoter
18:55:44 <mmorrow> the js AST you get can be prettyprinted back to js
18:55:51 <mmorrow> just like renderHtml
18:55:58 <mmorrow> in a sense
18:55:59 <chrisdone> right yeah
18:56:04 <Axman6> pumpkin: i talked to MariusAZ, and he said he didn't mean to be an ass if he was :)
18:56:15 <pumpkin> Axman6: thanks :)
18:56:31 <stepcut> found it, http://www.haskell.org/papers/NSWC/jfp.ps
18:56:53 <BMeph> pumpkin: The shootout sponsors dislike the concept of an RTS that's adjustable to the workload of the program.
18:56:54 <chrisdone> oh yeah I've read this
18:57:26 <stepcut> or not, that is a different one
18:57:26 <pumpkin> BMeph: should programs be submitted that specify the number of threads internally then?
18:57:34 <BMeph> Ditto. It's interesting. :)
18:57:45 <pumpkin> BMeph: seems like we'd perform a lot better if we could use multicore stuff
18:58:42 <BMeph> pumpkin: I think programs should be submitted that specify that the shootout personnel should step outside of the test machine's room for ten minutes before starting the run... ;)
18:58:57 <pumpkin> :o
18:59:24 <chrisdone> mmorrow: (\xs -> primHtml ("<a href=\"#"++intercalate "_" (reverse xs)++"\">"++head xs++"</a>"))
18:59:26 <chrisdone> naughty!!
18:59:47 <mjb> stepcut: Also see a paper by Lutz Prechelt written in 1999: http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/varianceTR.pdf
19:00:10 <chrisdone> mmorrow: (what's wrong with `hotlink')?
19:01:28 <Axman6> > (\xs -> primHtml ("<a href=\"#"++intercalate "_" (reverse xs)++"\">"++head xs++"</a>")) ["to be","or not to be"]

19:01:34 <Axman6> bah

19:01:44 <lambdabot>   "<a href=\"#or not to be_to be\">to be</a>"
19:01:46 <chrisdone> saved you a whole two chars there!
19:02:17 <chrisdone> join(,)
19:02:20 <Axman6> chrisdone: and lost a lot of clarity imo :)
19:02:20 <chrisdone> even shortar
19:02:29 <Axman6> join (,) is ok though
19:02:34 <chrisdone> haha
19:02:37 <chrisdone> INCONSISTENT STANDARDS
19:02:52 <Axman6> well, i understand join (,) :P
19:02:55 <chrisdone> :P
19:03:09 <pumpkin> Axman6: join (,) is less complicated than id &&& id? :o
19:03:16 <pumpkin> I mean, they're both prety esoteric :P
19:03:43 * Axman6 needs to learn what all this &&& nonsense is
19:03:51 <dolio> I like id &&& id better.
19:03:55 <pumpkin> it's really simple and nice
19:04:10 <Axman6> @src (&&&)
19:04:10 <lambdabot> f &&& g = arr (\b -> (b,b)) >>> f *** g
19:04:20 <chrisdone> > (\xs -> hotlink ("#"++intercalate "_" reverse xs) << head xs) ["to be","or not to be"]

19:04:27 <chrisdone> piffle and squish!
19:04:30 <Axman6> @src (***)
19:04:30 <lambdabot> f *** g = first f >>> second g
19:04:40 <Axman6> ah right
19:04:47 <Axman6> i need to start learning about arrows
19:04:53 <Axman6> anyway, breakfast time
19:04:56 <chrisdone> there's not much to learn actually
19:04:58 <DrSyzygy> Can I declare type classes parametrized over several types?
19:05:03 <chrisdone> I remember thinking oh god I need to learn arrows
19:05:14 <chrisdone> but there's not much to them
19:05:43 <DrSyzygy> So things like class Module a c where (.+) :: a -> a -> a; (.*) :: c -> a -> a
19:05:47 <DrSyzygy> Can I do that?
19:06:22 <Riastradh> With multi-parameter type classes you can.
19:06:34 <DrSyzygy> So this is one of the extensions, right?
19:06:38 <Riastradh> Yes.
19:06:40 <chrisdone> I think FlexibleInstances lets you
19:07:28 <chrisdone> no, ignore that
19:07:35 <chrisdone> mmorrow: ping?
19:09:12 <wli> FlexibleInstances, FlexibleContexts, and a few other things are needed to get by in most circumstances.
19:09:25 <dolio> Anyhow, (&&&) comes right from the categorical definition of products (ignoring that tuples aren't categorical products for now).
19:09:39 <somnolence> how can I remove elements from a list based on their value?
19:09:50 <dolio> So it seems nice to me.
19:10:04 <dublpaws> :t (>>>)
19:10:05 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) b c d. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a c d -> a b d
19:10:29 <Gracenotes> What does a bifunctor do? Is it a functor with kind * -> * -> *?
19:10:31 <akillah> somnolence: try filter
19:10:53 <Gracenotes> and two functions to map instead of one?
19:11:03 <dolio> Bifunctors are functors from product categories.
19:11:05 <somnolence> akillah: can you give me an example filtering 1200 from a [1..1000000] ?
19:11:15 <dolio> So C x C' -> D
19:11:21 <chrisdone> :t delete
19:11:23 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> [a]
19:11:26 <Gracenotes> what would they be in the Haskell world?
19:11:29 <dolio> Following the obvious laws.
19:11:42 <akillah> >  filter (==1) [1,2,1,2]
19:11:43 <lambdabot>   [1,1]
19:11:53 <chrisdone> > delete 1 [1,2,1,2]
19:11:54 <lambdabot>   [2,1,2]
19:12:06 <dolio> Type constructor with two parameters, and a function bimap :: (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> F a b -> F c d
19:12:31 <pumpkin> I'm hungry
19:12:37 <wli> Join the club.
19:12:46 <pumpkin> club sandwich?
19:12:54 * wli prays for phentermine.
19:13:02 <Gracenotes> hm.
19:13:24 <somnolence> and how can I add an element to a list?
19:13:37 <akillah> item : list ? ;-)\
19:14:08 <wli> 0 : [1..9]
19:14:08 <mjb> stepcut: If you're still around check out http://norvig.com/java-lisp.html
19:14:16 <pumpkin> {-# LANGUAGE C #-}
19:14:17 <wli> > 0 : [1..9]
19:14:19 <lambdabot>   [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
19:14:47 <akillah> also check http://www.google.com/search?q=haskell+tutorial
19:14:56 <dolio> Gracenotes: They're kind of bi-endofunctors, though, since all the categories are the same.
19:15:04 <dolio> Just like Haskell functors are endofunctors.
19:16:14 <stepcut> mjb: cool, that was the one I was looking for
19:16:21 <dolio> Either and (,) are the obvious examples. bimap f _ (Left a) = Left (f a) ; bimap _ g (Right b) = Right (g b) ; bimap f g (a,b) = (f a, g b).
19:16:48 <mmorrow> chrisdone: ok, they're fixed. you'll need both darcs repos in this dir http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/
19:17:05 <mmorrow> <chrisdone> mmorrow: (what's wrong with `hotlink')?
19:17:06 <mmorrow> heh
19:17:07 <wli> Product vs. coproduct etc.
19:19:36 <dolio> Which, bimap subsumes a couple different functions then.
19:20:02 <dolio> bimap on pairs is (***). bimap on Either is (+++) (I think that's the right one).
19:20:05 <dolio> @type (+++)
19:20:06 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) b c b' c'. (ArrowChoice a) => a b c -> a b' c' -> a (Either b b') (Either c c')
19:20:37 <dolio> Of course, not for general arrows. Just functions.
19:21:06 <mmorrow> chrisdone: and here's the output from that demo code (.css too) http://moonpatio.com/repos/js-qq/demo/labels.html
19:21:16 <ddarius> dolio: (id &&& id) also comes write from the definition of products.
19:21:54 <ddarius> s/write/right
19:22:01 <Gracenotes> mm
19:22:02 <mmorrow> oops, some of the plus images don't flip, but you get the idea ;)
19:22:48 <pumpkin>   return (0.0 == 0.0);
19:22:59 <mmorrow> hmm, that .html might be an older version, but with that .css + images you can regenerate it!
19:23:19 <dolio> ddarius: That's why I like it.
19:23:59 <dolio> Although \x -> (x,x) might be worth having its own name.
19:24:11 <idnar> @type (id &&& id)
19:24:12 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> (a, a)
19:24:41 <dolio> Along with \(x,y) -> (y,x)

19:25:39 <pumpkin> I also think both deserves a name
19:25:47 <pumpkin> f *** f that is
19:26:12 <pumpkin> just cause it's handy :)
19:26:36 <somnolence> how can i filter elements in a list from a list?
19:26:37 <pumpkin> and join (***) f isn't a good replacement :P

19:41:47 <Gracenotes> I've seen chess played on message boards with that character set
19:41:48 <cjb> hm, there is an emacs echess client
19:41:52 <mmorrow> or even an irc bot that plays chess
19:41:53 <cjb> that could be reworked in that way
19:41:55 <chessguy> dolio, eh?
19:41:56 <Gracenotes> ...not terribly successfully
19:42:02 <mmorrow> that would be cools
19:42:08 <idnar> ♕ is supposed to be white chess queen
19:42:09 <Gracenotes> not all media are good for representing matrices
19:42:09 <chessguy> oh wow
19:42:13 <Gracenotes> I don't think IRC would be :)
19:42:15 <cjb> an IRC bot that plays chess would be like twenty lines of code
19:42:18 <idnar> but it looks like a cloud here or something
19:42:22 <idnar> guess the font rendering is screwed up
19:42:25 <cjb> Gracenotes: you represent the moves, not the matrix

19:42:54 <cjb> chessguy: you wish ;-)

20:00:51 <chessguy> chrisdone, what are the types of html1 and js1 ?
20:01:01 <byorgey> chrisdone: the product monoid, eh? =)
20:01:21 <chessguy> byorgey, don't you mean _a_ product monoid?
20:01:36 <ray> *an* product monoid
20:01:42 <byorgey> well, sure
20:02:02 <byorgey> I guess I meant *the* product monoid for *those particular types*
20:02:19 <chessguy> ok, i'll let it slide then :)
20:02:28 <BMeph> stepcut: Think you could write a Haskell program for that in two hours? ;)
20:02:28 <ddarius> byorgey: Your terminology is the usual one.
20:02:45 <ddarius> Technically, there is still more than one product monoid even given particular types.
20:03:15 <byorgey> ddarius: are there more than two?
20:03:23 <ddarius> byorgey: Yes.
20:03:34 <chessguy> ddarius, are there more than 47?
20:03:38 <ddarius> chessguy: Yes.
20:03:48 <chessguy> ddarius, are there more than 682?
20:03:54 <ddarius> chessguy: Yes.
20:04:04 <pumpkin> ddarius: are there more than the number of naturals?

20:08:05 <jinjing> chrisdone: thanks, just random hacks
20:08:39 <stepcut> BMeph: maybe I'd just write a lisp interpreter in Haskell and then run the lisp example ;)
20:08:42 <ddarius> byorgey: If the underlying set is MxN, you can also have NxM or MxNx1 etc.  They are, of course, all (uniquely) isomorphic.
20:08:45 <jinjing> chrisdone: oh, it's a website for a , hmm, chinese electrical keyboard association
20:09:05 <chrisdone> jinjing: ahh! I see. :-)
20:09:11 <byorgey> ddarius: oh! is that all? ok. =)
20:09:32 <jinjing> chrisdone: new gd version is 1000?, shouldn't it be like 4000 something?
20:09:32 <byorgey> ddarius: I thought of MxN versus NxM which is why I asked if there were more than 2. =)
20:09:52 <byorgey> seems sort of like cheating to include 1.
20:10:08 <ddarius> byorgey: I figured as much.  |  No more cheating than swapping.
20:10:57 <Tan-chan> hi
20:11:11 <byorgey> It is on the Brent-O-Scale, which is a Patented Method (tm) for quantifying amounts of cheating present in mathematical constructions.
20:11:11 <chrisdone> jinjing: well, it's more of a fork and I can't get Bjorn by email so I just uploaded it with an older version number. if he approves then I can upload it as 3000.something
20:11:31 <byorgey> hi Tan-chan
20:11:31 <Tan-chan> I have a bit of a small problem... I'm not that great at Haskell and I have a small program that's giving me a bit of trouble...
20:11:32 <jinjing> oh, i c
20:11:44 <ddarius> If you want to start getting more cheatery, you can consider cosets and have MxNxS but simply identify every "factor" of S, in which case the answer to pumpkin's question is that there is a proper class of product monoids, but that seems unreasonable.
20:11:45 <chrisdone> jinjing: I wasn't really sure what to do with it
20:12:02 <jinjing> nod nod
20:12:04 <Tan-chan> I know what's wrong, but I don't know how to fix it
20:12:24 <byorgey> ddarius: hehe, I see =)
20:13:02 <byorgey> Tan-chan: why don't you paste your code on http://www.moonpatio.com:8080/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/ ?

20:13:40 <ddarius> chrisdone: The product monoid is simply what you get when you "run" to monoids side-by-side.
20:13:46 <byorgey> chrisdone: if M and N are monoids, then you can form the product monoid MxN whose elements are all possible pairs of elements from M and N, and the monoid operation just applies the operations of M and N pointwise
20:14:07 <chessguy> so...cartesian product?

20:16:09 <jinjing> chrisdone: oh, btw, http://dzqxh.com/ is running on kibro / mod panda :)
20:16:12 <chrisdone> is it right that a number can't be a monoid because it could be product or sum?
20:16:23 <chrisdone> oh, I guess what byorgey just said confirms that
20:16:23 * Gracenotes didn't know (,) required Monoid a, b =>
20:16:24 <Tan-chan> byorgey - I'm supposed to be compiling this with Curry.. but I've been cheating
20:16:35 <stepcut> chrisdone: no, you just get two monoids
20:16:43 <ddarius> chrisdone: Nothing stops you from making a numeric type an instance of Monoid
20:16:44 <chrisdone> jinjing: yeah! very cool CMS :-)
20:17:04 <chrisdone> sorry, I meant that there is no standard definition for it because of this reason
20:17:07 <chessguy> @src (,)
20:17:07 <Gracenotes> > (Sum 2, Product 2) `mappend` (Sum 2, Product 2)
20:17:07 <lambdabot> Source not found. My pet ferret can type better than you!
20:17:08 <lambdabot>   (Sum {getSum = 4},Product {getProduct = 4})
20:17:12 <stepcut> chrisdone: a monoid is any triple of (type, binary operator, identity element) that satisfies the monoid laws
20:17:27 <chrisdone> right
20:17:27 <byorgey> Tan-chan: I think the problem is [(c, n) : ys], that probably should be ((c,n) : ys)
20:17:27 <ddarius> chrisdone: Yes.
20:17:27 <stepcut> chrisdone: Data.Monoid uses newtypes to let you pick which instance you want
20:17:47 <byorgey> Tan-chan: [(c, n) : ys] is a list which contains a single element, namely, the list (c,n):ys
20:17:52 <somnolence> can you do argv in haskell?
20:18:02 <ddarius> :t getArgs
20:18:03 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `getArgs'
20:18:03 <byorgey> Tan-chan: whereas ((c,n) : ys) is just the list (c,n):ys
20:18:10 <ddarius> @hoogle getArgs
20:18:10 <lambdabot> System.Environment getArgs :: IO [String]
20:18:18 <Tan-chan> byorgey - oh so missed that...
20:18:20 <Tan-chan> XD
20:18:21 <stepcut> chrisdone: you might also consider (Int, +, 0) to be the monoid instance and (Int, *, 0) to be the semigroup(?) instance
20:18:24 <byorgey> Tan-chan: hehe =)
20:18:29 <Tan-chan> thanks so much!!
20:18:36 <chrisdone> stepcut: what's a semigroup?
20:18:36 <byorgey> sure!
20:18:42 <chessguy> byorgey++
20:18:59 <stepcut> chrisdone: one moment
20:19:05 <chrisdone> Gracenotes: that is neat
20:19:29 <chessguy> *sigh*
20:19:36 <chessguy> i suppose inspiration isn't going to strike me tonight
20:19:37 <chrisdone> what's up, chessguy?
20:19:49 <Tan-chan> byorgey - you just saved my rear end... thanks so much!!
20:19:49 <chessguy> chrisdone, code constipation
20:20:17 <chessguy> chrisdone, i've got this idea on the tip of my brain, and can't get my thoughts out
20:20:33 <ddarius> chessguy: Sounds like you need a bone saw.
20:20:42 <chrisdone> chessguy: I can only suggest going for a nice peaceful walk
20:20:53 <Gracenotes> > Dual (Sum 2) (Product 2) `mappend` Dual (Sum 2) (Product 2)
20:20:55 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `Product t -> a'
20:20:56 <chessguy> bah, it's snowing
20:21:23 <chrisdone> dangerous slippy walk isn't so conducive to abstract thinking, I suppose
20:21:44 <byorgey> Gracenotes: Dual only does something interesting for non-commutative monoids.
20:21:45 <Gracenotes> > Sum (Dual 5) `mappend` Sum (Dual 2)
20:21:46 <lambdabot>       No instance for (Num (Dual t))
20:21:46 <lambdabot>        arising from a use of `mappend' a...
20:22:01 <Gracenotes> hrm

20:22:06 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> Sum a
20:22:08 <byorgey> > Dual (Sum 5) `mappend` Dual (Sum 2)
20:22:09 <lambdabot>   Dual {getDual = Sum {getSum = 7}}
20:22:21 <byorgey> that does 2 + 5
20:22:29 <Gracenotes> ...ah, mentally switched about the instance declaration
20:22:30 <chrisdone> shouldn't the type of Sum have Num in it?
20:22:36 <chessguy> oh well, maybe tomorrow
20:22:38 <Gracenotes> > Sum True
20:22:40 <chessguy> g'night all
20:22:40 <lambdabot>   Sum {getSum = True}
20:22:49 <Gracenotes> the Monoid instance has Num, though
20:22:51 <chrisdone> oh, wait
20:22:54 <byorgey> chrisdone: the Monoid instance for Sum has a Num constraint
20:22:55 <Gracenotes> even though the actual type doesn't
20:23:18 <chrisdone> right
20:23:29 <byorgey> > appEndo (Endo (+1) `mappend` Endo (*3)) 4
20:23:31 <lambdabot>   13
20:23:41 <Gracenotes> Endo is function application... funs
20:23:41 <byorgey> > appEndo (Dual (Endo (+1)) `mappend` Dual (Endo (*3))) 4
20:23:42 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `Endo a'
20:23:44 <chrisdone> endo as in endofunctor? is that a real word?
20:23:56 <byorgey> chrisdone: right.
20:23:57 <rwbarton> chrisdone: endomorphism
20:24:04 <byorgey> er, right.
20:24:15 <byorgey> endofunctor is a real word too, but not the right one =)
20:24:30 <chrisdone> ah
20:24:57 <byorgey> > appEndo (getDual (Dual (Endo (+1)) `mappend` Dual (Endo (*3)))) 4
20:24:58 <lambdabot>   15
20:25:17 <chrisdone> :t appEndo
20:25:18 <lambdabot> forall a. Endo a -> a -> a
20:26:38 <Gracenotes> suspiciously similar to the type of ($)
20:26:54 <Gracenotes> if you unwrap Endo
20:27:13 <monochrom> hmm Dim Sum yummy
20:27:27 <Gracenotes> monochrom: programming in BASIC again? :P
20:27:37 <monochrom> haha
20:27:47 <monochrom> No, I'm inspired by "Dual Sum".
20:27:56 <ddarius> Gracenotes: All newtype wrappers are suspiciously similar to the type of id.
20:27:57 <chrisdone> > let ($) = appEndo . Endo in (+1) $ 1
20:27:58 <lambdabot>   2
20:28:04 <ddarius> Dim sum rocks
20:28:14 * ddarius mourns not having had dim sum in a long, long time
20:28:28 <Gracenotes> hm.
20:28:33 <monochrom> We just need another constructor Dim so we can right Dim (Sum 2)
20:28:35 <Gracenotes> true. (a -> a) -> (a -> a)
20:28:57 <ddarius> :t appEndo . Endo

20:29:24 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> a
20:34:36 <chrisdone> does anyone ever define (++) to be mappend in their serious projects?
20:34:41 <mmorrow> we need ML functors or the like baaaaad :)
20:35:01 <ddarius> mmorrow: The like == classes + various extensions + a bit of encoding
20:35:08 <mmorrow> totally
20:35:20 <mmorrow> whenever i import Monoid, i do
20:35:27 <monochrom> we need syntactic sugar for that
20:35:33 <mmorrow> import Data.Monoid(Monoid(..))
20:35:37 <ddarius> monochrom: That's mmorrow's job
20:35:39 <mmorrow> as my own little silent protest
20:36:00 <mmorrow> ddarius: something like that sure would be cool
20:36:25 <somnolence> how can I remove all the even numbers from a list?
20:36:30 <chrisdone> filter even
20:36:33 <somnolence> thnx
20:36:44 <gwern> what we need is sjanssen to finish his xmonad patches so anytime anyone complains about monoids we can say 'but look at how much nicer monoids made xmonad! kthnxbai'
20:36:44 <rwbarton> filter odd, surely :)
20:36:53 <mmorrow> heh
20:36:59 <chrisdone> oh I always forget filter means "I want these"
20:37:38 <ddarius> let keepingIf = filter
20:37:39 <mmorrow> i always do that too for a second before i write the predicate
20:38:04 <gwern> my problem with filter is that I think of it as negative - it'll remove things I don't want
20:38:10 <chrisdone> exactly
20:38:21 <chrisdone> like a sieve
20:38:27 <gwern> so I always write a filter function, look at it in ghci in puzzlement for a little bit, then go "d'oh" and slap in a 'not'
20:38:48 <chrisdone> (but one can of course think of a sieve as keeping things I want...)
20:38:50 <mmorrow> @let sieve = filter . (not .)
20:38:52 <lambdabot>  Defined.
20:39:00 <rwbarton> I always get filter right, but I always get max and min wrong...
20:39:07 <chrisdone> haha
20:39:08 <monochrom> "air filter" and "dust filter" :)
20:39:15 <somnolence> > filter even [1,2,3,4]
20:39:16 <lambdabot>   [2,4]
20:39:51 <int80_h> okay, I have more questions about partial applications
20:39:58 <int80_h> here's a two line function
20:40:11 <int80_h> multThree :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a -> a
20:40:17 <int80_h> multThree :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a -> a
20:40:17 <int80_h> multThree x y z = x * y * z
20:40:26 <int80_h> oops, first line pasted twice, sorry
20:40:54 <int80_h> okay, if I give multThree one argument, it will return a function that takes an argument right?
20:41:03 <gwern> @pl multThree x y z = x * y * z
20:41:03 <lambdabot> multThree = ((*) .) . (*)
20:41:17 <gwern> that's lovely
20:41:35 <int80_h> I don't know what that means. If the answer is yes, I have another question
20:41:44 <gwern> let multThre x y z = x * y * z in multThree 3
20:41:57 <rwbarton> int80_h: the answer is yes, technically, multThree 3 is a function, and every function in Haskell takes one argument
20:42:02 <Cale> int80_h: The function it gives will take another argument which will in turn give a function which takes yet one more
20:42:09 <Cale> (and produce a number)
20:42:21 <ddarius> which may be a function that takes yet one more
20:42:24 <gwern> > let multThre x y z = x * y * z in multThree 3
20:42:25 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `multThree'
20:42:31 <Cale> multThree x y z  means  ((multThree x) y) z
20:42:31 <int80_h> rwbarton, okay then. when I actually pass one argument in ghci, I get an error. Instead of a function that takes one argument
20:42:32 <gwern> > let multThree x y z = x * y * z in multThree 3 -- bah
20:42:33 <lambdabot>       Overlapping instances for Show (t -> t -> t)
20:42:33 <lambdabot>        arising from a use ...
20:42:58 <rwbarton> int80_h: well... trying to show a function will probably give you an error
20:42:58 <Cale> > let multThree x y z = x * y * z in ((multThree 2) 3) 5
20:43:00 <lambdabot>   30
20:43:09 <gwern> (so (multThree 3) == :: Int -> Int -> Int, or it takes 2 arguments)
20:43:23 <rwbarton> :t let multThree x y z = x * y * z in multThree 3
20:43:24 <lambdabot> forall t. (Num t) => t -> t -> t
20:43:29 <Cale> multThree :: (Num a) => a -> (a -> (a -> a))
20:43:42 <int80_h> okay, I have another example I need to talk out
20:43:44 <ddarius> :t let multThree x y z = x * y * z in multThree 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
20:43:45 <lambdabot> forall t t1 t2 t3 t4. (Num t3, Num t2, Num t1, Num t, Num (t -> t1 -> t2 -> t3 -> t4)) => t4
20:43:49 <Cale> (->) associates to the right, while function application associates to the left
20:43:59 <int80_h> that one was from LYAH. This next one is from an exercise I'm trying to do
20:44:49 <int80_h> okay, here is one line from a function. Let me know if I didn't give enough info
20:44:58 <int80_h> sortListByY xs = sortBy (comparing snd) xs
20:45:08 <int80_h> @hoogle comparing
20:45:08 <lambdabot> Data.Ord comparing :: Ord a => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Ordering
20:45:08 <lambdabot> Distribution.Simple.Utils comparing :: Ord a => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Ordering
20:45:16 <Cale> int80_h: Well, that is a complete definition :)
20:45:22 <int80_h> now, I need to talk out what is happening with comparing
20:45:24 <stepcut> chrisdone: http://people.cs.uu.nl/jeroen/article/algebra/
20:45:27 <Cale> int80_h: sure
20:45:45 <Cale> int80_h: (I'm the one who invented 'comparing', by the way)
20:45:52 <mmorrow> um, are floats still 32bits on a 64bit arch?
20:45:52 <pumpkin> yay
20:45:57 <pumpkin> yup
20:46:06 <rwbarton> , sizeOf (4 :: Float)
20:46:07 <lunabot>  luna: Not in scope: `sizeOf'
20:46:13 <pumpkin> luna is on 32-bit arch
20:46:14 <stepcut> chrisdone: a very cool tutorial on the basics of abstract algebra using gofer (though, I think its H98 compatible)
20:46:16 * ddarius suspects similar functions had been used long ago
20:46:18 <rwbarton> > sizeOf (4 :: Float)
20:46:19 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `sizeOf'
20:46:21 <int80_h> comparing (in a simplistic and not accurate sense) takes one function and two values of type b
20:46:28 <Cale> ddarius: I'm sure they have been :)
20:46:37 <mmorrow> i should just suck it and import Foreign into lunabot ;)
20:46:38 <stepcut> chrisdone: Rng is what I meant, not semigroup
20:46:39 <Cale> int80_h: That's accurate
20:47:01 <int80_h> Cale: well I thought haskell functions only take one arguement
20:47:07 <mmorrow> hmm, i was actually kidding, but if i hide unsafePerformIO it'd be fine (?)
20:47:09 <Cale> int80_h: But it's perhaps better to think of it as taking a function (b -> a), and producing a function (b -> b -> Ordering)
20:47:13 <mmorrow> i think
20:47:28 <rwbarton> > minBound :: Float
20:47:29 <lambdabot>       No instance for (Bounded Float)
20:47:29 <lambdabot>        arising from a use of `minBound'...
20:47:46 <Cale> int80_h: Functions which take more than one argument are functions which take one argument and return other functions. They're the same thing.
20:47:55 * mmorrow already tried to extract this info from lambdabot in a /msg ;)
20:48:21 <Cale> In this case, though, look at the type of sortBy, first.
20:48:24 <Cale> :t sortBy
20:48:25 <lambdabot> forall a. (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
20:48:36 <ddarius> Floats are always 32 bit on any x87 based architecture.
20:48:38 <mmorrow> ok, what about the alignment of a float on 64bits
20:48:39 <mmorrow> ?
20:48:41 <Cale> It takes a function (a -> a -> Ordering), a comparator, if you will.
20:48:49 <Cale> and it sorts the list using that
20:49:03 <Cale> data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
20:49:15 <BMeph> mmorrow: I'd say Chaotic Neutral. ;P
20:49:16 <Cale> > compare "hello" "world"
20:49:17 <lambdabot>   LT
20:49:27 <mmorrow> could anyone possibly do me a favor and run "alignment (undefined::Float)" on their 64bit box?
20:49:27 <Cale> "hello" < "world"
20:49:29 <rwbarton> BMeph: Floats are pure evil
20:49:32 <mmorrow> BMeph: i knew it!!
20:49:32 <int80_h> Cale: so what is happening, literally, when comparing is passed one argument (in this case snd)
20:49:48 <Cale> comparing p x y = compare (p x) (p y)
20:49:51 <int80_h> @hoogle snd
20:49:52 <lambdabot> Prelude snd :: (a, b) -> b
20:49:52 <lambdabot> Data.Tuple snd :: (a, b) -> b
20:49:52 <lambdabot> package hsndfile
20:49:55 <SamB> int80_h: operationally ?
20:49:59 <Cale> so comparing snd x y = compare (snd x) (snd y)
20:50:00 <int80_h> SamB: yes
20:50:11 <Olathe> I wish there was equating f a b = f a == f b
20:50:23 <Cale> So comparing snd is a comparison function which applies snd to its two parameters and then applies compare to the result.
20:50:23 <BMeph> rwbarton: Well, they're evil, but not consistently. In a sense, it just adds to their evilosity (heh-heh), but it still works out. ;)
20:50:24 <SamB> your implementation builds a partial application of comparing to that argument ;-P
20:50:26 <ddarius> @hoogle equating
20:50:26 <lambdabot> Distribution.Simple.Utils equating :: Eq a => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Bool
20:50:31 <int80_h> I ask because snd doesn't have the type I expect comparing wants
20:50:36 * mmorrow just guesses it's 8byte aligned and goes with it
20:50:39 <ddarius> :t on (==)
20:50:40 <Cale> int80_h: oh, it does.
20:50:40 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Eq b) => (a -> b) -> a -> a -> Bool
20:50:43 <Cale> :t snd
20:50:44 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a, b) -> b
20:50:47 <pumpkin> mmorrow: 4
20:50:53 <mmorrow> pumpkin: thx
20:50:55 <SamB> :t comparing
20:50:57 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Ord a) => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Ordering
20:51:01 <Cale> Suppose that the second elements of a pair are an instance of the Ord class
20:51:02 <SamB> :t comparing snd
20:51:03 <lambdabot> forall a b. (Ord b) => (a, b) -> (a, b) -> Ordering
20:51:05 <int80_h> I don't think I understand the notation (a,b) -> b
20:51:18 <mmorrow> @type (42,"sadf")
20:51:18 <SamB> > fst (1, 2)
20:51:20 <lambdabot> forall t. (Num t) => (t, [Char])
20:51:20 <lambdabot>   1
20:51:22 <SamB> > snd (1, 2)
20:51:23 <lambdabot>   2
20:51:27 <Cale> int80_h: snd takes a pair consisting of a value of type a and a value of type b, and produces a value of type b
20:51:30 <mmorrow> @type \(42,"sadf") -> ()
20:51:31 <lambdabot> forall t. (Num t) => (t, [Char]) -> ()
20:51:32 <SamB> :t (1,2)
20:51:33 <lambdabot> forall t t1. (Num t1, Num t) => (t, t1)
20:51:37 <Olathe> It takes something of type (a, b) and gives something of type b.
20:51:39 <mmorrow> @type \(a,b) -> ()
20:51:41 <lambdabot> forall t t1. (t, t1) -> ()
20:51:53 <int80_h> Cale: gotcha, okay go on with what you were saying
20:52:02 <Cale> :t comparing
20:52:04 <lambdabot> forall b a. (Ord a) => (b -> a) -> b -> b -> Ordering
20:52:11 <Cale> snd :: (s,t) -> t
20:52:16 <int80_h> Cale, can we go to the overflow channel?
20:52:20 <Cale> So, if we take b = (s,t)
20:52:24 <Cale> and a = t
20:52:36 <Cale> then snd :: b -> a
20:52:39 <Cale> and the types match
20:53:14 <Cale> so comparing's type specialises to: (Ord t) => ((s,t) -> t) -> (s,t) -> (s,t) -> Ordering
20:53:40 <int80_h> Cale: okay :)
20:53:58 <ksf> there are things that are just unreal.
20:54:10 <Cale> ksf: Like 3 + 4i?
20:54:11 <ksf> the first google hit for "glx tutorial", for example.
20:54:18 <ksf> it uses php.
20:54:25 <int80_h> I perfer to think of them as epireal
20:54:26 <ksf> http://www.planetcoding.net/thread.php?threadid=2038
20:54:51 <Cale> int80_h: okay, so after being applied to snd, we have a function of type Ord t => (s,t) -> (s,t) -> Ordering
20:54:56 <Cale> Which function?
20:54:59 <int80_h> Cale made a pun!
20:55:07 <int80_h> Cale: reading...
20:55:53 <int80_h> Cale: you're asking me which function has that type?
20:56:00 <Cale> Well, which function do we get?
20:56:12 <Cale> comparing p x y = compare (p x) (p y)
20:56:23 <Cale> Or, to write it another way,
20:56:28 <Cale> comparing p = \x y -> compare (p x) (p y)
20:56:47 <Cale> so, substituting snd for p, we have
20:56:57 <Cale> comparing snd = \x y -> compare (snd x) (snd y)
20:57:26 <defun> Hi, I am trying to install Yi with "cabal install yi". I get the following error: (http://pastebin.com/m631636). How can I fix this.
20:57:45 <jkeen> Can I ask a question about installing ghc here or is there a better channel?
20:58:13 <Cale> and so when we write  sortBy (comparing snd),  it's as if we've written  sortBy (\x y -> compare (snd x) (snd y))
20:58:18 <int80_h> Cale: not sure I understand lambda notation yet
20:58:22 <Cale> ah
20:58:37 <Cale> (\x -> ...) is the function which takes a parameter x, and produces "..."
20:58:42 <Cale> For example...
20:58:48 <Cale> > (\x -> x^2) 5
20:58:49 <lambdabot>   25
20:58:59 <int80_h> gotcha
20:59:07 <Cale> They can have multiple parameters as well.
20:59:14 <Cale> > (\x y -> x^2 + y^2) 3 4
20:59:16 <lambdabot>   25
20:59:42 <Cale> To do that reduction by hand...
21:00:16 <int80_h> Cale: thanks for the help. I'll distill your lecture from the logs and ponder
21:00:20 <Cale> (\x y -> x^2 + y^2) 3 4 --> (\y -> 3^2 + y^2) 4 --> 3^2 + 4^2 --> 9 + 16 --> 25
21:00:56 <Cale> (\x y -> ...) is the same as (\x -> (\y -> ...))
21:01:00 <ddarius> > error "a" + error "b"

21:01:54 <int80_h> Cale: Thanks :)
21:02:06 <Cale> No problem
21:02:18 <Cale> Let me know if you have any more questions about it :)
21:02:53 <int80_h> I will, I'll get what you said from the logs, print it out
21:05:03 <somnolence> how do I concatenate strings over several lines?
21:05:37 <Cale> concat ["foo",
21:05:42 <Cale>         "bar",
21:05:45 <Cale>         "baz"]
21:05:46 <Cale> ?
21:05:49 <somnolence> naw
21:05:59 <Cale> I'm not sure what you're asking :)
21:05:59 <somnolence> I'll find another way
21:06:05 <somnolence> str="asdf
21:06:05 <dolio> "foo\ \bar\ \baz"
21:06:06 <somnolence> asdf"
21:06:22 <Cale> Oh, you can use string gaps.
21:06:43 <somnolence> ....?
21:06:44 <ddarius> > "foo\ \bar\ \baz"
21:06:46 <lambdabot>   "foobarbaz"

21:11:07 <SamB> are you trying to figure out how to replicate Python's "import this" in a language used by far cleverer people than Python ?
21:11:20 <SamB> well the problem is that imports aren't strict in Haskell ...
21:11:35 <SamB> so you can't just stick an unsafePerformIO in the module and expect to see the message!

21:15:12 <Olathe> Sure.
21:15:16 <Gracenotes> that's neat, though :)
21:16:11 <Gracenotes> I wonder... if you applied that function hundreds of times and in weird combinations of substrings, how strong would the overall encryption be?
21:16:54 <Gracenotes> it /is/ two-way, making it unusable for serious encryption
21:17:08 <Gracenotes> at least in the public/private key model... hrm
21:17:37 <Olathe> > map (uncurry (flip ((!!) . iterate pred) . (`mod` 5))) . zip [0..] $ [x, y, z]
21:17:38 <lambdabot>   [x,pred y,pred (pred z)]
21:18:14 <Olathe> It wouldn't be very strong.
21:18:35 <Gracenotes> well, the actual encryption is succ, pred is decryption
21:18:54 <Olathe> Sure.
21:19:06 <Olathe> This is a weak version of Vigenere, I think.
21:19:11 <Gracenotes> maybe if you split up strings in odd patterns, recombined then, applied the encryption again, etc.
21:19:15 <Olathe> Which is easy to automatically find the key for.
21:19:17 <jkeen> Does anyone know if there is a list of system dependencies for various versions of ghc?
21:19:19 <newsham> > zipWith id (iterate (pred.) id) [x,y,z]
21:19:21 <lambdabot>   [x,pred y,pred (pred z)]
21:20:26 <newsham> or did you mean cycle (take 5 (iterate (pred.) id)  ?
21:20:39 <Gracenotes> yeah.
21:20:52 <Olathe> Let's see here.
21:21:01 <somnolence> how can I select an integer from a list?
21:21:12 <Cale> jkeen: you can do something like  ldd /usr/local/lib/ghc-6.10.1/ghc
21:21:58 <Gracenotes> somnolence: what kind of list? You can get the nth element of a list with xs !! n

21:22:05 <jkeen> Well, I'm actually having trouble installing a newish version.  6.8.3 wouldn't install, apparently because of older libraries according to google.
21:22:12 <somnolence> Gracenotes: [Integer] , !! returns int
21:22:15 <jkeen> I tried lying to it but that didn't go very well.
21:22:15 <somnolence> I think
21:22:18 <somnolence> o.o
21:22:36 <Gracenotes> :t ([1,2,3,4] :: [Integer]) !! 2
21:22:37 <lambdabot> Integer
21:22:44 <somnolence> -.-
21:22:46 <Cale> jkeen: Which version do you have?
21:22:49 <SamB> jkeen: what libraries do you HAVE ?
21:22:49 <somnolence> oddd
21:23:05 <Cale> 6.10.x needs libedit
21:23:06 <Gracenotes> somnolence: however, length returns an Int
21:23:13 <somnolence> I know....
21:23:14 <jkeen> I've got a fairly stock debian 4 system.  I'd like to have a version newer than the 6.6 that ships with it.
21:23:18 <Cale> ah
21:23:27 <Gracenotes> if you're using an unspecified Num list with a length, then it'll infer the type is [Int]
21:23:47 <bos> @seen dons
21:23:47 <lambdabot> dons is in #concatenative, #arch-haskell, #darcs, #xmonad, #ghc and #haskell. I last heard dons speak 4h 3m 15s ago.
21:24:51 <Cale> jkeen: and so you've installed/tried to install the generic linux binary for 6.10.x?
21:24:59 <somnolence> :t [1,2,3,4] !! (5 :: Integer)
21:25:00 <lambdabot>     Couldn't match expected type `Int' against inferred type `Integer'
21:25:00 <lambdabot>     In the second argument of `(!!)', namely `(5 :: Integer)'
21:25:08 <somnolence> Gracenotes: remedy
21:25:09 <somnolence> ?
21:25:50 <Gracenotes> > let x = (2 :: Integer) in [1,2,3,4] !! (fromInteger x)
21:25:52 <lambdabot>   3
21:25:52 <jkeen> I tried the generic 6.8.3 binary.  The version of pwd in utils failed with a floating point exception during the configure stage.
21:26:00 <Gracenotes> just one solution... may not be the best
21:26:12 <Gracenotes> there's also genericIndex
21:26:17 <somnolence> thnx
21:26:18 <somnolence> that worked
21:26:21 <somnolence> fromInteger
21:26:22 <jkeen> 6.10.x, last I looked, doesn't compile parts of xmonad so that is out unfortunately.
21:26:24 <somnolence> >_<
21:26:30 <Gracenotes> > let x = (2 :: Integer) in [1,2,3,4] `genericIndex` x
21:26:32 <lambdabot>   3
21:26:38 <Gracenotes> not as pretty as !!, though :)
21:26:39 <jeffz`> jkeen: iirc, you can recompile that pwd
21:26:54 <Cale> jkeen: Out of curiosity, are you on a 64 bit system?
21:27:07 <Gracenotes> somnolence: still, genericIndex is a nice solution. Take your pick :D
21:27:15 <jkeen> That could be good.  I made the configure script use the system pwd and it configured properly but it failed with a similar error at install time.
21:27:34 <Cale> I'm not certain why it uses its own pwd
21:27:36 <jkeen> It's a 64-bit chip but a 32-bit OS.  Not real sure how that all falls out.
21:28:01 <Cale> okay
21:29:08 <Cale> Maybe ldd its custom version of pwd and make sure there's nothing blatantly wrong?

21:29:23 <Olathe> Note that it sees that 5 is pretty likely.
21:29:53 <Cale> Where's the reference to the library version problem?
21:30:30 <Cale> oh, what would happen, I wonder, if you replaced the custom pwd with a link to the system pwd?

21:31:08 <SamB> jkeen: what kind of kernel ?
21:31:08 <lambdabot>   [5,2,1,3,4,6,7]
21:31:11 <Olathe> Even better.
21:31:11 <jkeen> Cale, the reference to a library problem is here: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/2211
21:32:02 <jkeen> SamB, 2.6.18-6.  It's the stock kernel for the distribution so I'm not real sure how it's configured.
21:32:21 <SamB> jkeen: the same one that gets installed on 32-bit machines ?
21:32:22 <diltsman> hpaste.org is the place to past a code section, right?
21:32:32 <SamB> diltsman: moonpatio.com, actually
21:32:37 <SamB> Cale: did you get my patch ?
21:32:45 <nanothief> Olathe: just curious, what is that function doing?
21:32:55 <Cale> SamB: I haven't checked my mail in a while...
21:33:09 <diltsman> SamB: New site or is my memory bad?
21:33:15 <SamB> Cale: it would make @hpaste display the correct URL
21:33:19 <SamB> diltsman: the old one died
21:35:18 <jkeen> Cale, I tried replacing pwd with the system pwd.  It configured fine but crashed later with this error: http://pastebin.com/d7362d444
21:35:50 <jkeen> SamB, so far as I know it is.
21:36:06 <mmorrow> jkeen: looks like you have the wrong binary pkg
21:36:08 <SamB_XP> jkeen: well it can't very well be a 64-bit kernel if that's true
21:36:22 <mmorrow> are you one a Xeon?
21:36:29 <mmorrow> (i had this problem before)
21:36:41 <jkeen> SamB, It's a 32 bit version of debian.
21:36:49 <Olathe> nanothief: It breaks the string into n strips of every nth character. Like "abcdefgh" -> "aceg", "bdfh" for two.
21:37:12 <SamB_XP> jkeen: that doesn't mean there are no 64-bit kernels included
21:37:19 <mmorrow> jkeen: do you already have a ghc on this machine?
21:37:29 <Olathe> nanothief: Then, it counts repeats of characters in each strip.
21:37:46 <Olathe> nanothief: Then, it sums the repeats in all the strips to give a count of repeats.
21:37:48 <jkeen> mmorrow, no I don't.  I can put version 6.6 on via apt if I need to.
21:38:11 <mmorrow> jkeen: one solution would be just to get 6.6, then build 6.8 or 6.10 from src
21:38:24 <Olathe> nanothief: If that's a very high number, the encryption probably uses a key that size.
21:38:39 <parodyoflanguage> This channel never stops anymore.
21:38:47 <jkeen> mmorrow, I didn't even think of that actually.  Everything I've looked at compiling from source it's been without any version of ghc available.  That's just painful.
21:38:50 <parodyoflanguage> Must be a lot of interest in haskell.
21:38:57 <nanothief> Olathe, heh thats pretty cool
21:39:03 <Cale> parodyoflanguage: Well, there are nearly 600 people here.
21:39:22 <Olathe> nanothief: Yeah :) I got the idea partly from here a while back: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_coincidence#Example
21:39:28 <parodyoflanguage> Cale, yeah, that's incredible.
21:39:46 <mmorrow> jkeen: oh yeah, it's nasty without a ghc already
21:40:16 <mmorrow> jkeen: 6.6 is relatively fast (compared to 6.4), so at least you have that going for you ;)
21:40:42 <mmorrow> but really, it shouldn't be too bad. 30-40min i guesstimate
21:41:18 <mmorrow> it took me 3+ hours to bootstrap a 6.8 with a 6.4 on this crappy hosted webserver ...
21:41:43 <mmorrow> make -jALOT is key
21:41:45 * ksf thinks it's kinda strange that linking with -lGL pulls in libncurses.
21:42:01 <mmorrow> make -j10 # my favorite (i have 2 cores)
21:42:35 <ksf> ...and 128G+ ram?
21:42:42 <mmorrow> yes please
21:42:56 <jkeen> mmorrow, I think I'll give that a try then.  I've been waiting five hours now for a usb key to finish transfering some data so 40 minutes isn't too bad :)
21:43:08 <diltsman> I am working on a parser for class (no, I'm not allowed to use Parsec).  I'm building the parse tree and I'm wondering how to fix the last function in the following code chunk: http://moonpatio.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=1003
21:43:15 <mmorrow> make -j10 pegs both of my cores at 100% for 20-30min straight
21:43:25 <diltsman> I understand why it doesn't work, but I'm not exactly certain how to go about fixing it.
21:43:43 <ksf> > 2^48 `div` 1024^3
21:43:45 <lambdabot>   262144
21:43:48 <mmorrow> jkeen: yeah, it's super painless
21:44:03 <ksf> hey, I could even address that much.
21:44:24 <ksf> mmorrow, -j3 or -j4 should do the same.
21:44:46 <ksf> ...and be faster, as you won't get into swapping.
21:45:00 <mmorrow> ksf: "go big or go home"
21:45:07 <mmorrow> (relly though, it doesn't)
21:45:10 <mmorrow> *really
21:45:26 <mmorrow> i use make -j5 when i actually want to use the computer while it's building
21:46:04 <ksf> the question also is whether -j10 and using 100% is faster than -j3 and using 98%.
21:46:05 <mmorrow> i should really time it though
21:46:14 <ksf> cpu usage /= effective work.
21:46:15 <mmorrow> yeah, a good question too
21:46:55 <Cale> diltsman: The problem is that schemesNode is supposed to be a TreeNode, not an action for producing one.
21:47:03 <Cale> diltsman: Perhaps you want to run that action?
21:48:06 <Cale> like   parseDatalogProgram = do t <- schemesNode; return (TreeNode {..., firstChild = Just t, ...})
21:49:26 <mmorrow> chmod 700 darcs-all && ./darcs-all --extra get && bash boot && ./configure --prefix=blah && make -j3 && sudo make install # my one liner
21:49:50 <mmorrow> s/-j10/-j3/ for ksf
21:49:53 <mmorrow> ;)
21:50:02 <diltsman> Cale: Thanks.  That worked perfectly.  Didn't think to use the do notation there to fix that.
21:50:25 <ksf> model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+
21:50:37 <ksf> I don't even use -j2, usually.
21:50:48 <Cale> diltsman: That's an odd tree type.
21:50:50 <ksf> ...as I want to keep using my system.
21:51:07 <mmorrow> model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU         T7200  @ 2.00GHz
21:51:08 <mmorrow> model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU         T7200  @ 2.00GHz
21:51:24 <mmorrow> yeah, i can't wait til cabal does par builds
21:51:54 <diltsman> Cale: I know.  Problem is that the actual symbol types aren't all the same, but I can put together a class that will work for all of them.
21:51:55 <mmorrow> it pains me to see only one core pegged for long periods
21:51:57 <ksf> that's 4 ghz @ 2*2ghz, I got 3200 ghz @ 1x 2 ghz ;)
21:52:46 <SamB_XP> 3200 GHz ?
21:52:49 <SamB_XP> that's impressive
21:52:55 <ksf> acually, I also got 4ghz.
21:53:01 <diltsman> Cale: Any suggestions to make it less ugly?
21:53:03 <ksf> ...if you consider the bogomips.
21:53:27 <ksf> wait no they aren't measured in ghz.
21:53:44 <mmorrow> MemTotal:      3106284 kB
21:53:46 <ksf> don't listen to me, they are.
21:54:09 <Cale> diltsman: Well...
21:55:13 <mmorrow> uhhhmm, i must've put one of my oneGB rams in by accident when i thought i was sticking two 2GB cards in..
21:55:28 * mmorrow is just noticing this after over a week
21:55:40 <Cale> data TreeNode = Tip | forall a. (Symbol a) => Branch a TreeNode TreeNode
21:55:44 <Cale> maybe that would be nicer
21:56:12 <Cale> I'd also be somewhat suspicious of the existential altogether
21:56:21 <Cale> What does the Symbol class look like?
21:57:15 <ksf> for some reason, my swap partition is flagged hpfs/ntfs.
21:57:19 <ksf> dunno why ;)
21:57:19 <diltsman> The Symbol class currently doesn't have any members, but I expect to need to add actual members as I get farther in to this project.
21:57:40 <mmorrow> ksf: u got pwnd by windoze!!@
21:57:42 <ksf> it's a sata disk, so windoze won't run on it, anyway.
21:57:43 <Cale> diltsman: What methods does it have? None?
21:57:56 <diltsman> Cale: Has none at the moment.
21:58:02 <Cale> diltsman: okay...
21:58:22 <mmorrow> ksf: does bash pop up the paperclip assistant when you type an unknown cmd?
21:58:39 <Cale> diltsman: Almost all of the time, you can package up the methods into a data structure, and just use that instead.
21:58:45 <diltsman> Cale: I haven't figured out exactly what they are all going to need to do.  The big problem is that symbol could be either Token (terminal) or a non-terminal.
21:59:06 <Cale> diltsman: Well, isn't that just a simple type?
21:59:21 <Cale> data Symbol = Terminal Token | NonTerminal Something
21:59:51 <Cale> (or you could use Either)
22:00:13 <mmorrow> i wonder what it would take to get cabal to do par builds
22:00:20 <diltsman> Cale: That makes a lot more sense than what I am doing.  I guess that is what I get after having class, work, and homework for 12 hours straight.
22:00:37 <mmorrow> i know Saizan was working on this, but i can't remember what he said was the stopper on that
22:01:30 <mmorrow> it seems like you just need to get the SCCs of the module dep graph, then "walk" it
22:02:15 <mmorrow> (in parallel)
22:02:56 <pumpkin> mo
22:02:57 <pumpkin> moo
22:03:15 <mmorrow> oom
22:03:16 <mmorrow> om
22:03:43 <pumpkin> you undid me!
22:03:58 <mmorrow> didn't i not!
22:04:32 <Cale> o^-2 m^-1
22:05:20 <pumpkin> lol
22:05:25 <mmorrow> crap
22:05:34 <pumpkin> wow, you say crap
22:05:37 <pumpkin> and along comes spoop
22:05:48 <mmorrow> oh dear!
22:06:12 <pumpkin> mmorrow, Cale: either of you on twitter?
22:06:23 <pumpkin> I need to follow more people
22:06:30 <mmorrow> no
22:06:54 * mmorrow is not hip with that
22:06:59 <mmorrow> what's your twitter link?
22:06:59 <Nafai> pumpkin: I am :)
22:07:09 <pumpkin> Nafai: !!!
22:07:20 <pumpkin> I'm http://twitter.com/pumpkingod
22:07:24 <Nafai> http://twiter.com/travisbhartwell
22:07:26 <mmorrow> haha
22:07:34 <Olathe> > let sortAp f xs = map fst.sortBy (comparing snd).zip xs.map f $ xs in sortAp abs [-10..10]
22:07:36 <lambdabot>   [0,-1,1,-2,2,-3,3,-4,4,-5,5,-6,6,-7,7,-8,8,-9,9,-10,10]
22:07:39 <Cale> pumpkin: I don't see the point of twitter.
22:07:40 <Olathe> Is there a better name for that ?
22:08:02 <pumpkin> Cale: it's to write inane things that no one cares about so your friends can do the same without feeling guilty about it
22:08:28 <pumpkin> it's very altruistic
22:08:35 <pumpkin> in a circular sort of way
22:09:40 <Cale> pumpkin: Ah, so like a blog then?
22:10:07 <pumpkin> Cale: exactly! but with less commitment and no space for real haskell information!
22:10:10 <mmorrow> it seems like if blogs were phone calls, twitter would be txting
22:10:39 <BMeph> It's very jerky...in a circular sort of way. ;)
22:10:45 <pumpkin> mmm
22:11:37 <pumpkin> wow, was twitter that bad?
22:12:31 <BMeph> pumpkin: Not saying it's bad, just...counter-productive. ;)
22:12:47 <pumpkin> I was just referring to mmorrow quitting
22:14:52 <pumpkin> :)
22:19:50 <BMeph> Olathe: It's essentially a Schwartzian Transform, although I've seen some with more leeway in the comparison function. :)
22:30:12 <roconnor> help! libghc6-http-dev is screwing up my ubuntu upgrade
22:30:18 <roconnor> can can't reinstall
22:30:22 <roconnor> I can't remove
22:30:30 <roconnor> I can't reinstall
22:30:47 <roconnor> Removing libghc6-http-dev ...
22:30:49 <roconnor> ghc-pkg: cannot find package HTTP-3001.0.4
22:30:50 <roconnor> dpkg: error processing libghc6-http-dev (--purge):

22:30:55 <roconnor> plz help!
22:31:25 <Heffalump> use the option to remove it without running the scripts
22:31:30 <Heffalump> and manually unregister
22:31:54 <roconnor> is that an aptitude option?
22:32:05 <Heffalump> probably need to use dpkg
22:32:17 <Heffalump> dpkg -r --something libghc6-http-dev
22:33:46 <mofmog1> Haskell is obsolete. Obviously the most general way of programming is where you program languages.
22:33:56 <mofmog1> Thue is the new wave of the future, oh you haskellers are so behind the times!
22:34:11 <mofmog1> Also monolithic kernels suck
22:34:11 <roconnor> Heffalump: --triggers-only ?
22:34:45 <pumpkin> we get the weirdest troll attempts in here
22:35:40 <roconnor> Heffalump: that is the only option vaguely resembling what you say
22:36:55 <roconnor> Heffalump: and doesn't really sound like what you want
22:37:03 <Heffalump> roconnor: ok, then clobber the script in /var/lib/dpkg/info
22:37:19 * Heffalump has to go to work
22:41:56 <ksf> xhb could be described as _slightly_ low-level.
22:42:36 <ksf> that is, once you figured out how to query available fonts, like this:
22:42:36 <ksf> X.listFonts c (X.MkListFonts 15 1 (map castCharToCChar ['*'])) >>= X.getReply >>= print
22:43:01 <ksf> ...you get a list of list of numbers back.
22:43:24 <sjanssen> ksf: xhb is about as low level as it gets, in a number of ways
22:43:47 <Olathe> @check \xs -> reverse (sortBy (comparing abs) xs) == sortBy (flip (comparing abs)) xs
22:43:48 <lambdabot>   "Falsifiable, after 12 tests:\n[4,-2,2]\n"
22:44:16 <ksf> well, I expected it to be protocol-level low-level, but not unmarshalled like that.
22:45:11 <roconnor> > reverse (sortBy (comparing abs) [-1,1]
22:45:12 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `;'
22:45:25 <roconnor> > reverse (sortBy (comparing abs) [-1,1])
22:45:26 <lambdabot>   [1,-1]
22:45:39 <roconnor> > sortBy (flip (comparing abs) [-1,1])
22:45:40 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `[t] -> Ordering'
22:45:45 <roconnor> > sortBy (flip (comparing abs)) [-1,1]
22:45:47 <lambdabot>   [-1,1]
22:46:10 <Olathe> It will reverse the list, except that equal things are kept in their original order.
22:46:14 <Olathe> It's like stable reversing.
22:46:51 <Raevel> interesting
22:47:09 <sjanssen> ksf: hmm, what is the type returned? CChar?
22:47:47 <ksf> [CChar].
22:47:57 <ksf> ...and its length.
22:48:00 <ksf> go figure.
22:48:06 <sjanssen> yeah, consistent with my copy of the protocol defn.
22:49:25 <sjanssen> ksf: it might make sense to treat the X protocols STRING8 as [Char]
22:49:30 <sjanssen> even though that is a bit of a fib
22:50:16 <ksf> I'd be happy with [CChar] or [Word8] or anything.
22:50:39 <sjanssen> or we could have newtype String8 = String8 [CChar] -- and use GHC's overloaded string to make it a bit more bearable
22:50:47 <ksf> the thing that annoys me is having to ignore the length annotations while demarshalling.
22:51:11 <sjanssen> yeah
22:51:32 <sjanssen> do you have to supply the lengths when calling functions?
22:51:41 <ksf> definetely.
22:51:45 <sjanssen> ouch
22:52:01 <ksf> they also come in different maximum sizes.
22:53:13 <ksf> otoh, the generator code is very, very clean, so automagic marshalling should be easy.
22:53:46 <ksf> ...it doesn't really matter whether xhb throws exceptions on you for trying to pass lists that are long enough or X for sending bad requests.
22:54:00 <ksf> s/long enough/too long
22:56:31 <ksf> another thing that annoys me wrt. xhb is the fact that it depends on xauth ;) . without that, there'd be no c libs left haskell x apps are linked to.
22:58:22 * ksf is going to call it a day and drink a well-earned beer.
22:58:31 <sjanssen> ksf: yeah, I didn't really feel like implementing the various authentication schemes
23:02:11 <ksf> quick survey: how many of you actually used X's network transparency?
23:02:54 <dolio> I have. But I prefer something more like VNC, really.
23:03:03 * wli watches every haskell lib under the sun fail to compile on gentoo.
23:03:38 <sjanssen> ksf: I have
23:03:47 <sjanssen> not frequently, but I have
23:04:11 <sjanssen> ksf: you aren't one of those people that thinks it complicates X and that it should be removed, are you?
23:04:21 <ksf> not at all, I used it myself.
23:04:26 <olsner> ksf: my x server lacked sun fonts so all I got was squares, and eventually emacs simply crashed
23:04:43 <sjanssen> ksf: ah, good :)
23:05:00 <olsner> so there are some non-trivial compatibility issues with the whole "transparency" thing (sometimes, at least)
23:05:43 <ksf> primarily for running licq on my pc while being somewhere else.
23:06:20 <wli> Someting weird is going on with various haskell libs.
23:07:39 <olsner> @ty mappend (== 0)
23:07:40 <lambdabot>     No instance for (Monoid Bool)
23:07:40 <lambdabot>       arising from a use of `mappend' at <interactive>:1:0-13
23:07:40 <lambdabot>     Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Monoid Bool)
23:07:45 <omg911> anyone got gtk2hs installed with the lastest ghc build?
23:08:10 <olsner> @ty mappend (And . (== 0))
23:08:11 <lambdabot> Not in scope: data constructor `And'
23:08:40 <olsner> bah, liftM2 (&&) is what I'm looking for anyway
23:08:49 <BMeph> olsner: "All", maybe? :)
23:10:00 <olsner> @ty mappend (All . (== 0))
23:10:01 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => (a -> All) -> a -> All
23:11:13 <wli> olsner:Which transparency is this?
23:11:29 <olsner> but "all" and "any" take predicates - "and" and "or" are the functions working on booleans directly .. shouldn't the monoid names match the names of those functions?
23:12:08 <olsner> wli: the network transparency of X
23:12:45 <wli> It's a big feature. I'm not surprised there are non-trivial compatibility issues.
23:13:36 <olsner> neither am I, at least not after trying :)
23:14:51 <ksf> well, it's certainly possible to write clients that just don't behave like they should.
23:17:07 <Gracenotes> there's probably not a way to represent monads to djinn, is there?
23:18:18 <dolio> Djinn doesn't really do higher kinded variables very well.
23:18:45 <dolio> Or higher rank polymorphism at all.
23:18:51 <Gracenotes> mm.
23:19:45 <Gracenotes> @djinn (m a -> a) -> (a -> m a) -> (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
23:19:45 <lambdabot> -- f cannot be realized.
23:19:53 <dolio> I suppose it does higher kinded variables just fine, but ther's not much you can do with them.
23:19:57 <Gracenotes> oh... I see
23:20:01 <dolio> Without higher rank polymorphism.
23:20:08 <Gracenotes> (not like the above is a monad)
23:20:29 <dolio> @djinn (m a -> a) -> (b -> m b) -> (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
23:20:30 <lambdabot> f a b c d = b (c (a d))
23:20:37 <Gracenotes> ah
23:40:44 <dormoose> Hi. Is there a standard and easy way to turn a hex string like 000001ab into an Int? I could of course write it manually, but…
23:43:19 <sjanssen> > read "0x000001ab" :: Int
23:43:20 <lambdabot>   427
23:43:51 <sjanssen> dormoose: you can use the above, or see Numeric.readHex
23:44:08 <dormoose> Hmm! Thanks!
23:44:50 <dormoose> How does it work? read "0x001ab" fails
23:44:59 <dormoose> and "0x000001ab" :: Int fails as well.
23:45:21 <dblhelix> dormoose: drop the quotes
23:45:31 <dblhelix> > 0x001ab :: Int
23:45:33 <lambdabot>   427
23:46:06 <dormoose> Hm, I still can't see how it's supposed to work
23:46:32 <dblhelix> dormoose: I'm sorry, I just dropped in; what's the problem?
23:47:04 <dormoose> dblhelix: The original problem was to convert hex strings into Int. Now the new problem is understanding why read "0x000001ab" :: Int works.
23:47:35 <dblhelix> ah, I missed the read part
23:47:37 <vixey> > read "0x000001ab" == 0x000001ab
23:47:39 <lambdabot>   True
23:47:47 <vixey> > read "()" == ()
23:47:49 <lambdabot>   True
23:47:50 <dblhelix> @type read
23:47:51 <lambdabot> forall a. (Read a) => String -> a
23:47:58 <vixey> > read "\"foo\"" == "foo"
23:47:59 <lambdabot>   True
23:48:52 <dblhelix> dormoose: read provides a parser for any type that is the the Read; you have to give Haskell some clue on *what* type to use from this class, as there are many
23:49:00 <dormoose> hmm, OK
23:49:33 <dblhelix> dormoose:  the type ascription :: Int is doing exactly that
23:52:31 <dormoose> OK. Does it attach to the "0x1ab" part specifically?
