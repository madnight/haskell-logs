00:00:08 <DeezNuts> well
00:00:19 <DeezNuts> then why can't i do the same in the interpreter itself
00:01:07 <Cale> When you load hugs with a haskell file, it goes into a loop where it reads in expressions and evaluates them.
00:01:20 <Cale> Those expressions can use things from the file you loaded.
00:01:53 <Cale> Normally, I just keep an editor window open with my source, and reload in ghci (or hugs) whenever I change it.
00:02:06 <Cale> then I can use the interpreter to debug.
00:02:28 <DeezNuts> is hugs missing any features from the haskell 98 standard?
00:03:10 <Cale> there are some minor differences: http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/pages/users_guide/haskell98.html#BUGS-HASKELL98
00:03:46 <DeezNuts> oh yeah i read that
00:03:52 <DeezNuts> but im not sure what it all means
00:04:03 <DeezNuts> i understand the i18n thing
00:04:12 <DeezNuts> but nothing else there
00:04:17 <Cale> most of it I wouldn't worry about
00:04:23 <DeezNuts> am i likely to come across these bugs?
00:04:32 <Cale> not likely
00:04:34 <DeezNuts> which should I worry about then
00:04:38 <DeezNuts> (u said most of it)
00:04:54 <DeezNuts> blah sorry im talking all stupid
00:05:03 <DeezNuts> which parts should I worry about
00:06:14 <DeezNuts> sorry im hounding u
00:06:16 <DeezNuts> forget that
00:06:17 <DeezNuts> ill find out
00:06:24 <Cale> hmm... depends what you're doing, I don't think that any of it will matter
00:06:29 <DeezNuts> but i do have one very simple question
00:06:33 <Cale> okay
00:06:36 <DeezNuts> how can I print stuff
00:06:39 <DeezNuts> to the console
00:06:53 <Cale> main = putStrLn "blah"
00:06:57 <DeezNuts> (scanning through the tutorial i haven't found out how yet)
00:07:08 <DeezNuts> k
00:07:11 <DeezNuts> thanks
00:07:14 <Cale> you'll find out about do notation, and eventually monads and such
00:07:26 <DeezNuts> ill
00:07:35 <Cale> when it comes time to learn about monads, there's a really good tutorial...
00:07:49 <Cale> http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/
00:08:41 <DeezNuts> i have a CT book
00:08:46 <Cale> Monads seem harder to use than they are. Once you just start using them, it's all very natural. Still it can take some time to really "click". (Like objects, say)
00:08:56 <DeezNuts> should i just wait until get to that topic in my book?
00:09:41 <Cale> If you're into category theory, then you'll think it's cool from that perspective, but from the monad-user perspective, you don
00:09:54 <Cale> don't really need to understand any category theory
00:09:58 <DeezNuts> oh ok
00:10:05 <DeezNuts> are 'monoids' the same as 'monads'?
00:10:08 <Cale> no
00:10:13 <DeezNuts> ok
00:10:21 <DeezNuts> related?
00:10:27 <Cale> somewhat
00:10:40 <Cale> monoids are sets with a single operation which is associative and has an identity element
00:10:56 <Cale> you can also think of them as one-object categories, if you're so inclined
00:11:06 <DeezNuts> heh im just starting the book
00:11:09 <DeezNuts> but i think i understand
00:11:50 <Cale> monads have a slightly more complicated definition: http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Monad.html
00:12:07 <DeezNuts> a jack of all links
00:12:11 <cptchaos> by the way, is there a good resource for categorey theroy in the net?
00:12:26 <Cale> they satisfy a somewhat different kind of associativity and identity
00:12:37 <Cale> hmm... yeah, there's at least one decent paper
00:12:57 <DeezNuts> theres a pdf somewhere i got
00:13:08 <Cale> The thing that's done the most for my understanding of category theory has been to see its use in my algebraic topology course.
00:13:23 <Cale> Is it "Triples, toposes and theories"?
00:13:45 <Cale> http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/ttt.html
00:14:03 <Cale> Toposes, Triples, and Theories, rather
00:14:16 <DeezNuts> dunno i think it was 'a gentle introduction to category theory'
00:14:43 <Cale> I haven't found anything that really reads well.
00:15:02 <Cale> There were a bunch of people on this channel studying category theory a while back...
00:15:11 <DeezNuts> i have a nice book
00:15:20 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/StudyGroup
00:15:26 <DeezNuts> which doesn't require a lot of prereqs in math
00:15:30 <DeezNuts> ya
00:15:31 <DeezNuts> that one
00:15:35 <Cale> cool
00:15:41 <Cale> you should talk with them
00:15:43 <DeezNuts> u like that book?
00:15:50 <Cale> I don't have it
00:15:50 <DeezNuts> i was talking to Pseudonym
00:16:03 <DeezNuts> he gave me that link
00:16:07 <Cale> cool
00:16:11 <DeezNuts> so what do I do just edit the page
00:16:14 <DeezNuts> with a question or something?
00:16:28 <Cale> go to the bottom - you'll find a link there
00:16:51 <Cale> those people all hang out here
00:17:08 <Cale> If you'd like to talk to them, they're usually around at various times.
00:17:21 <Cale> I should get the book and read it too.
00:17:49 <cptchaos> ok thanks
00:18:55 <DeezNuts> Cale: would it be useful to people who have a strong background in higher mathematics?
00:19:16 <Cale> To learn category theory?
00:19:19 <DeezNuts> Cale: wouldn't you be able to get a deeper understanding from reading a more advanced text?
00:19:21 <DeezNuts> ya
00:19:40 <Cale> I don't actually know a whole lot of category theory yet.
00:19:42 <DeezNuts> i got this book since it seems unique in that it doesn't require much of any prereqs
00:19:46 <DeezNuts> k
00:19:54 <Cale> I understand many of the basic constructions.
00:20:09 <Cale> (products, coproducts, pushouts, pullbacks)
00:20:20 <Cale> and some others
00:20:36 <Cale> but I haven't gone a long way with it
00:21:17 <Cale> I studied it on my own a little in my "spare time" last year, but seeing as I put spare time in quotes there, I didn't get very far.
00:21:35 <DeezNuts> i dont know jack shit about it
00:21:37 <DeezNuts> ;-)
00:21:46 <DeezNuts> just read the first part called 'preview'
00:21:47 <Cale> Now I'm using it directly in my algebraic topology course, and so it's coming to life.
00:21:56 <DeezNuts> oh
00:21:59 <DeezNuts> so how do u use it
00:22:00 <DeezNuts> without knowing it
00:22:15 <Cale> Well, I've only used basic stuff.
00:22:19 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:22:19 <Cale> Pushouts are very cool.
00:22:39 <Cale> In the category of topological spaces, pushouts glue surfaces together.
00:22:46 <DeezNuts> kew
00:22:55 <DeezNuts> keep in mind i only got up to calc1
00:23:05 <Cale> (and only on a specified part of the surface in a specified way)
00:23:07 <Cale> yeah
00:23:22 <Cale> I won't go into the details here
00:24:02 <Cale> seeing as you probably haven't read about pushouts either.
00:26:07 <Cale> but yeah - category theory gets really fun when you start looking at the examples.
00:26:34 <DeezNuts> sorry was afk :)
00:26:44 <DeezNuts> yeah this book starts out with some interesting stuff
00:27:01 <DeezNuts> it discusses some experiments of galileo
00:27:35 <Cale> Even simple category theoretic constructions can give vivid pictures in any specific case. Then you start comparing the pictures you get with the different categories, and the overall picture gets a lot clearer.
00:27:58 <DeezNuts> and how one can determine the full flight path of (for example) a bird, by splitting up the problem into three objects and two mappings
00:28:16 <Cale> hehe
00:28:23 <Cale> that's cool
00:28:29 <Cale> categorical physics
00:28:34 <DeezNuts> yeah so u look at the path of the shadow
00:28:41 <DeezNuts> on a plane
00:28:58 <DeezNuts> and the height from the plane
00:29:07 <DeezNuts> (a line)
00:29:19 <DeezNuts> and it demonstrates how SPACE = PLANE x LINE
00:29:31 <Cale> :)
00:29:37 <DeezNuts> this is just the very first few pages mind u
00:29:40 <DeezNuts> so its simple
00:29:41 <Cale> yeah
00:29:49 <Cale> that's a neat example
00:29:59 <DeezNuts> but the way its described is interesting
00:30:04 <DeezNuts> ya
00:30:14 <Cale> Functors are really really cool
00:30:22 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:30:25 <DeezNuts> ct-specific functions?
00:30:35 <DeezNuts> or functions in general?
00:30:42 <Cale> they're like homomorphisms of categories
00:30:55 <Cale> (if you've seen the word homomorphism before)
00:30:55 <DeezNuts> i dont know what a homomorphism is yet
00:30:58 <DeezNuts> but i think they explain it
00:31:14 <DeezNuts> i've seen it in an old book i have on algebraic structures
00:31:15 <Cale> they're functions from one category to another that preserve the structure to some extent
00:31:16 <DeezNuts> (abstract algebra)
00:31:20 <DeezNuts> but i haven't gone through that book
00:31:25 <DeezNuts> nice
00:31:28 <Cale> functors give you a sketch picture of one category inside another
00:31:35 <DeezNuts> interesting
00:31:35 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:31:47 <DeezNuts> i have a problem that maybe this could apply to
00:32:02 <Cale> In algebraic topology, we study topological spaces by looking at the groups that they give under a number of functors.
00:32:09 <DeezNuts> i want to understand how matter arranged itself into biological life
00:32:17 <Cale> (and rings, but the course I'm taking won't cover that I don't think)
00:32:34 <DeezNuts> all greek to me :p
00:32:39 <DeezNuts> hopefully not for long
00:33:01 <DeezNuts> so topology is the study of complicated shapes?
00:33:04 <Cale> A group is a monoid where all the elements have inverses
00:33:09 <Cale> Sort of, yeah
00:33:20 <DeezNuts> i sort of know what a group is
00:33:37 <DeezNuts> <Z,+> the group of all integers and the sum operation
00:33:52 <Cale> It's the geometry of rubber sheets - if two shapes can be smoothly deformed into one another, we consider them the same in some sense.
00:33:55 <Cale> yeah
00:34:17 <Cale> so a coffee cup is "the same as" a donut with a hole
00:34:37 <DeezNuts> nice
00:34:51 <DeezNuts> so u topology folks must be interested in the limits of these shapes?
00:35:06 <Cale> limits?
00:35:11 <DeezNuts> like at what point do they cease to be the same shape?
00:35:16 <DeezNuts> i dunno :p
00:35:26 <Cale> yeah
00:35:31 <DeezNuts> u tell me heh
00:35:38 <Cale> in the sense that we'd like to be able to tell them apart
00:35:56 <DeezNuts> whats a particularly interesting example problem from topology?
00:36:05 <Cale> R^2 seems different from R^3
00:36:17 <DeezNuts> well ya! its three dimensions instead of two
00:36:33 <Cale> right, but you see
00:36:58 <Cale> We consider things to be exactly the same if there's a continuous bijection between them.
00:37:08 <Cale> (with a continuous inverse actually)
00:37:29 <Cale> That's called a homeomorphism (note the extra o).
00:37:43 <Cale> In linear algebra, we know that they're not the same
00:38:08 <Cale> but how do we check that there's not a homeomorphism from R^2 to R^3?
00:38:20 <cptchaos> in german we call it a "homöomorphismus"
00:38:28 <Cale> We certainly can't go through all the bijections - there are lots of them.
00:38:36 <cptchaos> i thing I like the english writing  more :-)
00:38:48 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:38:53 <DeezNuts> Cale im sorry im losing u
00:38:56 <Cale> In linear algebra, we wouldn't make such a pitiful attempt
00:38:59 <DeezNuts> i really need to do a lot more work with bijections
00:39:02 <DeezNuts> and *orphisms
00:39:03 <DeezNuts> etc
00:39:09 <Cale> we'd say - oh, they're of different dimension
00:39:24 <DeezNuts> wait till i finish an abstract algebra book :p
00:39:35 <DeezNuts> or even this ct book
00:39:39 <DeezNuts> it seems to introduce those ideas
00:40:12 <Cale> dimension is an invariant on vector spaces that we could use to tell them apart. The goal is to find topological invariants to tell things apart on a topological level.
00:40:28 <DeezNuts> invariant?
00:40:53 <Cale> yeah, it tells us when two things are not the same
00:41:18 <Cale> whenever we examine the dimension of a vector space, it's always the same, no matter how we figure it out
00:41:36 <DeezNuts> hey sorry to ask something off-topic but can an action be a mathematical 'object'?
00:41:49 <Cale> sure
00:41:59 <DeezNuts> anything can be an object?
00:42:10 <DeezNuts> even a thought?
00:42:23 <Cale> yeah - so long as you go to the trouble of defining precisely what you mean axiomatically.
00:42:44 <Cale> what do you mean by action?
00:42:54 <DeezNuts> the flight path of a bird
00:42:56 <Cale> what rules does an "action" satisfy?
00:43:14 <DeezNuts> i dunno
00:43:18 <DeezNuts> i dunno any physics
00:43:39 <DeezNuts> see that second part is a little demanding :p
00:43:57 <DeezNuts> err
00:43:58 <DeezNuts> i meant
00:43:59 <Cale> that part right there is the problem that the physicists are all working on
00:44:01 <DeezNuts> the whole thing
00:44:19 <DeezNuts> defining physical phenomenon axiomatically?
00:44:41 <Cale> but we can get an approximation to what an "action" is in the real world, by making a mathematical model of it
00:44:46 <Cale> yeah
00:44:57 <DeezNuts> damn
00:45:03 <DeezNuts> well im just trying to do this exercise
00:45:03 <Cale> Most physics starts with some axioms and builds up.
00:45:34 <DeezNuts> "Find other examples of combining two objects to get a third. Which of them seem to fit our pattern? That is, for which of them does the third object seem to have 'maps' to the two you began with?"
00:46:06 <Cale> Since category theory is part of math, you might look at math first.
00:46:12 <DeezNuts> (other examples - meaning something like the SPACE = PLANE x LINE thing)
00:46:16 <Cale> right
00:46:23 <Cale> How about sets?
00:46:34 <DeezNuts> ok
00:46:41 <DeezNuts> A = { 1, 2, 3 }
00:46:48 <DeezNuts> B = { 4, 5, 6 }
00:46:59 <DeezNuts> C = A U B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
00:47:11 <Cale> hmmm
00:47:19 <DeezNuts> lol
00:47:21 <DeezNuts> ok thats not it
00:47:24 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:47:34 <Cale> well, let's look at that
00:47:34 <DeezNuts> i have to think of a map
00:47:37 <DeezNuts> ok
00:47:57 <DeezNuts> I have two sets
00:47:59 <DeezNuts> er 3
00:48:11 <DeezNuts> but the third one has all the elements of the first two
00:48:11 <Cale> can we find a "natural" way to project the elements of C to the elements of A and B?
00:48:22 <DeezNuts> project?
00:48:33 <Cale> i.e. map
00:48:38 <DeezNuts> yeah
00:48:40 <DeezNuts> A U B
00:48:42 <DeezNuts> ;-)
00:48:50 <DeezNuts> wait
00:48:53 <DeezNuts> thats reverse
00:48:58 <DeezNuts> hmm
00:49:12 <DeezNuts> actually i started off really bad
00:49:16 <Cale> C is A U B, I mean - you're looking for functions f: C -> A and g: C -> B
00:49:48 <DeezNuts> can we use a physical example first?
00:49:54 <DeezNuts> then translate those to sets?
00:49:54 <Cale> perhaps.
00:50:11 <DeezNuts> something like the flight of the bird
00:50:33 <DeezNuts> how about
00:50:41 <DeezNuts> the path of a planet
00:50:42 <DeezNuts> :)
00:50:48 <DeezNuts> similar but different enough
00:50:50 <Cale> hmm...
00:51:08 <DeezNuts> we have gravity at work just the same
00:51:08 <DeezNuts> but
00:51:23 <DeezNuts> does it work differently than how it works on the bird?
00:51:47 <DeezNuts> hmm what else besides the suns gravity
00:51:53 <DeezNuts> determines the path of a planet?
00:52:05 <Cale> Well, space still has the same sort of shape in some sense...
00:52:16 <Cale> not much
00:52:21 <DeezNuts> well
00:52:26 <DeezNuts> how come we are not all orbiting the earth
00:53:03 <Cale> because the Earth's gravity is just strong enough to hold us down.
00:53:11 <Cale> anyway
00:53:20 <Cale> I'll give you the sets one if you'd like
00:53:26 <DeezNuts> ok sorry to interrupt u
00:53:32 <Cale> Look at AxB
00:53:34 <DeezNuts> i just thought i started with a bad example
00:53:34 <DeezNuts> ok
00:53:39 <Cale> (the cartesian product)
00:53:41 <DeezNuts> ya
00:53:54 <DeezNuts> 9 ordered pairs
00:54:03 <Cale> are there "maps" to A and to B from each of those pairs?
00:54:24 <Cale> (that in some sense characterise the pair)
00:54:32 <DeezNuts> yeah
00:54:45 <Cale> see how that works?
00:55:00 <Cale> products sort of build squares from lines
00:55:04 <DeezNuts> (x,y) \in AxB if x,y in \A U \B?
00:55:13 <DeezNuts> doh
00:55:18 <DeezNuts> (x,y) \in AxB if x,y \in A U B?
00:55:36 <Cale> (x,y) is in AxB if x is in A and y is in B
00:55:52 <DeezNuts> ok so the other one is just a relation
00:55:52 <DeezNuts> ?
00:56:06 <Cale> so our projections will map (x,y) to x and (x,y) to y respectively
00:56:11 <DeezNuts> ok
00:56:24 <DeezNuts> hmm ok i got it!
00:56:33 <DeezNuts> i could draw a box representing AxB
00:56:34 <Cale> each pair is determined uniquely from where the projections go
00:56:37 <Cale> yeah
00:56:40 <DeezNuts> and inside it put each ordered pair
00:56:47 <DeezNuts> and two other boxes, one for A and B each
00:57:09 <DeezNuts> and draw a line from each element in AxB to two other elements
00:57:14 <DeezNuts> one in A and one in B
00:57:21 <Cale> right
00:57:25 <DeezNuts> ill
00:57:39 <Cale> and where those arrows go are enough to tell what the pair was
00:57:49 <DeezNuts> yep
00:57:54 <DeezNuts> btw
00:58:10 <DeezNuts> isn't there a product
00:58:11 <DeezNuts> of sets
00:58:21 <DeezNuts> that doesn't demand the resulting elements to be ordered pairs?
00:58:57 <Cale> well, any product of sets will be in bijection with a cartesian product
00:59:04 <DeezNuts> bijection?
00:59:19 <Cale> (at least if you mean product in the categorical sense)
00:59:30 <Cale> bijections are maps which are 1 to 1 and onto
00:59:59 <DeezNuts> im gonna grab that lin alg book
01:00:21 <Cale> i.e. if f(x)=f(y) implies x = y, and for any u in the codomain of f, there's some x such that f(x)=u
01:00:25 <Cale> anyway
01:00:30 <Cale> it's really really late now
01:00:33 <Cale> I ought to sleep
01:00:44 <DeezNuts> kew man
01:00:49 <DeezNuts> thanks for helping
01:00:52 <DeezNuts> talk to u laters
01:00:55 <Cale> later
01:05:35 <DeezNuts> bah im retarded i need sleep
03:33:04 <TripleDES> morning
03:33:08 <skew> hello
04:52:54 <themaximus> bbl (skiing)(WEE!)
07:24:31 <earthy> hm. the vim syntax region stuff does not want to cooperate the way I want it to
10:43:15 <pnm> hi all
10:43:31 <pnm> I've got an error that's very puzzling
10:43:43 <pnm> I'm hoping someone might be able to shed some light on it
10:44:01 <pnm> Shapes.hs:4: parse error on input `where'
10:44:35 <pnm> thing is, my line 4 looks like the top of many of my other haskell files that work
10:44:48 <pnm> Module Shapes where
10:45:13 <pnm> so I'm assuming the actual problem is elsewhere in the file
10:45:58 <pnm> just wondered whether there's a common cause for this kind of error
10:48:34 <Riastradh> 'module' should not be capitalized.
10:49:30 <pnm> ahh
10:49:34 <pnm> got it
10:49:37 <pnm> thanks
10:49:56 <pnm> sorry, should've spotted that. stupid me
11:29:36 <shapr> yeehaa
11:30:14 <liiwi> hiihaa
11:30:50 <Riastradh> hoo*blort*
11:30:59 <shapr> explort?
11:31:03 * Riastradh implorbs.
11:35:17 <shapr> "hackers (1337 members)" <--- this must be a joke
11:35:26 <shapr> that's the orkut hackers community.
11:36:23 <tic> heh
11:36:27 <Jad> hello guys
11:36:46 <shapr> hi jad
12:33:51 * Marvin-- sighs
12:34:04 <SyntaxNinja> what's wrong, sugar ;)
12:34:08 * SyntaxNinja picks on Marvin--
12:34:34 <Marvin--> sheesh, you aren't gonna let that go, are you? :)
12:35:18 <SyntaxNinja> that was it.
12:35:19 <SyntaxNinja> no more
12:35:49 <SyntaxNinja> I recognize the fact that I always find my jokes the funniest, and try not to inflict them on everyone else for too long.
12:36:05 <Marvin--> heh
12:36:17 <SyntaxNinja> it was an Airplane reference, by the way, which is an awesome movie.
12:38:40 <Marvin--> haven't seen it
12:40:19 <SyntaxNinja> oh.  The joke is something along the lines of, "Surely you must be joking!" ... "I'm not joking, and stop calling me Shirley"
12:41:38 <Marvin--> oh, heh
12:47:52 <Marvin--> hmm, I wonder how much to write about logic and semantics in the report and how much I should assume the reader knows
12:53:33 <Riastradh> _Airplane_ is a strange movie.  It's so low-down that when it first came out its ratings were horrible, simply because people didn't want to admit they found such a movie hilarious, which it is.
12:57:25 <Maddas> haha
12:58:19 <SyntaxNinja> heh
12:58:32 * Marvin-- watches Philadelphia
13:16:19 <Etaoin> Riastradh: Roger.
13:16:48 <Riastradh> ?
13:17:16 <Etaoin> just acknowledging
13:36:02 * SamB wonders why hugs dies when he types in just !
13:36:44 <skew> are you sure it isn't just shelling out?
13:38:43 <Marvin--> ! starts a shell, yes
15:43:34 <swisscheese> Hi all - I've seen several web pages about programming contests but no detailed results comparing productivity in Haskell to C++. Anyone known where to find it?
15:43:58 <skew> I know of no detailed results.
15:44:30 <skew> I can think of one paper where they had something impelemented in a bunch of languages
15:45:26 <swisscheese> Do you have a URL?
15:47:00 <skew> http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs457_2003/hudak-jones.pdf
15:47:26 <skew> That's not necessarily the best version, just the first hit on the first query I thought of
15:48:19 <swisscheese> Thanks - checking now.
15:48:36 <skew> http://haskell.org/papers/NSWC/jfp.ps
16:03:20 <swisscheese> Thanks skew.
16:40:31 <Lunar^> hOp lives !
16:41:07 <Lunar^> GHC RTS initialize until Unix signals settting (which we do not handle at this time).
21:37:22 <skew> does anybody here know how to debug space leaks?
21:37:45 <skew> I'm playing with the wheel seive prime generation code, and my heap usage keeps climbing
21:38:31 <skew> the heap usage profile in montone and -hr attributes most of it to a CAF
21:39:15 <skew> so I think none of the generators are being freed.
23:24:40 <Maddas> uh
23:25:11 <Maddas> Haskell has an extremely low amount of LOC there, skew
23:25:36 <Maddas> And quite a low development time!
23:25:37 <DeltaZer0> LOC?
23:25:41 <DeltaZer0> lines of code?
23:26:20 <Maddas> Yeah
23:40:30 <Maddas> a pity they don't elaborate on the Relational Lisp solution
23:40:59 <DeltaZer0> Maddas, what are you talking about
23:41:10 <DeltaZer0> some language comparison?
23:41:50 <Maddas> oh, you weren't here. http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~apt/cs457_2003/hudak-jones.pdf
23:43:08 <DeltaZer0> why is haskell listed twice in figure 3?
23:43:27 <Maddas> Read the explanations
23:44:02 <Maddas> One solution was written by a hired graduate student who had 8 days to learn haskell with no other formal training
23:44:28 <DeltaZer0> wow
23:44:41 <DeltaZer0> ok, i see the explanations now
