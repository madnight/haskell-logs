00:31:03 <shapr> bonjour kowey 
00:31:36 <kowey> good morning
00:45:26 <cleverdra> aye, orkut seems very strange.
00:45:53 <Heffalump> yes, I refuse to participate in the "rate your friends" thing.
00:46:30 <cleverdra> ew, 'rate your friends'?  Rate them how?
00:46:58 <Heffalump> three scales (1-3) of how trustworthy, sexy and cool they are.
00:47:06 <shapr> yah, it does seem rather bizarre
00:47:14 <Heffalump> That bit is anonymous and gets aggregated somehow to produce an overall rating for them
00:47:15 <shapr> but I don't take it very seriously either
00:47:32 <Heffalump> I'm glad someone else has the same reaction to it that I do.
00:48:04 <Heffalump> I was beginning to think I was strange for thinking this was a terrible idea.
00:49:23 <cleverdra> I think that (with my 10 minutes of experienc?) that they've made the system to allow for several different approaches to it, from 'I want to date' to 'I also find X interesting.'
00:49:30 <shapr> it's like the rating thing on sourceforge, I haven't seen anyone really use it, and I wouldn't trust it if I saw someone rate someone else.
00:49:31 <cleverdra> also, 'experience'.
00:50:25 <shapr> I stopped taking it seriously when I realized I have only programmer friends, and still more hearts than anything else.
00:50:29 <earthy> that whole orkut thing reminds me of sixdegrees.com
00:50:39 <shapr> yah, it's a sixdegrees remake.
00:50:41 <cleverdra> shapr - hearts?
00:50:44 <earthy> only done just a tad better with regards to privacy
00:50:46 <shapr> hearts == sexy
00:50:57 <cleverdra> shapr - hee.
00:51:10 <Heffalump> shapr: lol
00:51:14 <earthy> shae, your brain obviously sexes them up. :)
00:51:18 <shapr> I have like three icecubes, five smileys, and *lots* of hearts.
00:51:20 <Heffalump> I also have more hearts than anyone else, but only since my gf joined.
00:51:25 <shapr> haha
00:51:26 <Heffalump> s/anyone/anything/
00:52:00 <earthy> somehow I feel glad I'm not on orkut ;)
00:52:09 <earthy> (talk about your big-ass profiling done on ya...)
00:52:10 <shapr> earthy: quick what's your email address? I'll invite you ;-)
00:52:20 <Heffalump> btw, to all uu.nl people, looks like I'll be in Utrecht March 1st-3rd
00:52:30 <earthy> ah, *good*
00:52:34 <shapr> yay, haskell hackfest time!
00:52:44 <earthy> kosmikus'll be back from his writing retreat by then as well
00:52:46 <Heffalump> well, I'm going for Stratego stuff :-)
00:52:46 <darius-> kind of nutty for people to put both dating and professional info on the same site
00:52:55 <Heffalump> yeah, I already talked to him
00:52:57 <earthy> let's hang. :)
00:52:57 <cleverdra> earthy - about two hours ago I saw the discussion on here (after hearing about it a few days ago) and immediately decided that I would have nothing to do with it.
00:53:13 * cleverdra shrugs.
00:53:18 <shapr> it's fun, but not very serious.
00:53:46 <shapr> I am occasionally surprised to see that some people know others directly.
00:53:52 * cleverdra runs across Randal Schwartz and then Xah Lee in the last 2 minutes.  wow.
00:54:09 <earthy> `runs across', with your car or waht?
00:54:14 <shapr> peter norvig is on there too.
00:54:15 <Heffalump> the "know directly" isn't always 100% accurate in my case, for example
00:54:35 <Heffalump> cos someone who I don't really know directly, except through having helped him with a personal statement on a wiki, added me as a friend, so I just reciprocated
00:54:51 <shapr> right, not very serious.
00:54:59 <shapr> ooh, nice pic from andersca 
00:55:10 <shapr> geez, andersca has 15 friends already.
00:55:13 <earthy> this is all on orkut? geez.
00:55:20 <cleverdra> earthy - I added the person that invited me as a friend, and then ran through his communities, and then saw Randal as a member of one, and then saw Xah Lee's 'testimony' on Randal.
00:55:22 <earthy> geeks'n'their toys. ;)
00:55:31 <earthy> cleverdra: ah.
00:55:32 <shapr> earthy: it'll blow over in a coupla months
00:55:35 <andersca> shapr: 17 now
00:55:44 <cleverdra> shapr - blow over?
00:55:47 <shapr> I got invited by Steve Alexander, which surprised me.
00:55:51 <earthy> ah heck, back to writing
00:55:54 <shapr> cleverdra: like a storm blows over
00:56:04 <shapr> or is that a southeasternism?
00:56:29 <cleverdra> shapr - I understand the term, sorry.  How do you suppose that what will blow over, to what end? =)
00:56:30 <shapr> andersca: you look slightly scary in that pic :-)
00:56:42 <shapr> orkut
00:56:44 <shapr> like sixdegrees
00:57:05 <andersca> shapr: it's one of the hacker heads
00:57:16 <shapr> hacker heads?
00:57:17 <andersca> shapr: http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/heads/
00:57:33 <shapr> haha! coool!
00:57:37 <Heffalump> right, work calls
00:57:39 <cleverdra> shapr - what happened to sixdegrees?
00:57:48 <shapr> wow, you have our own ICON!
00:57:55 <shapr> um "your"
00:57:59 <andersca> :)
00:58:33 * cleverdra remembers joining Firefly at a young age, and finding it interesting, but then not much doing anything with it.
00:58:49 <shapr> cleverdra: yah, once all the connections are made, I think that's what will happen.
00:59:38 <shapr> what's up with xah lee anyway?
00:59:47 <andersca> shapr: http://carbon.csbnet.se/hacker-celebs/
01:00:29 <cleverdra> shapr - troll.
01:00:33 <shapr> andersca: extra-spiffy!
01:00:37 <cleverdra> shapr - www.xahlee.org
01:00:38 <shapr> cleverdra: I'd sort of guessed that.
01:00:46 <cleverdra> shapr - oh, how did you guess?
01:00:48 <andersca> shapr: just put that together yesterday
01:01:01 <shapr> yah, I've seen his page, that made up my opinion about him.
01:01:38 <cleverdra> I mostly find the meow_wars.txt documenting he has interesting.
01:04:05 <darius-> hm, how do you tell orkut you're a fan of someone?
01:04:33 <shapr> there's a rate your friends link on your homepage
01:04:58 <darius-> hooray, time to play the popularity game
01:06:19 <darius-> andersca - you look kind of like max headroom :)
01:06:28 <andersca> who is max headroom
01:06:43 <darius-> 80's tv character - was supposed to be computer generated
01:06:51 <darius-> but was actually an actor
01:08:35 <shapr> john meacham looks like a very fun person.
01:14:33 <darius-> huh, they have a wesley clark but no howard dean or george bush up there
01:25:11 <kowey> if i might ask (yet another) haskell question...
01:25:31 <shapr> yes
01:25:58 <kowey> one of my monad exercises wants to make an Either String monad,
01:26:06 <cleverdra> (kowey - ask as many questions as you like.)
01:26:27 <kowey> but if i follow the key or hint, and start with: instance Monad (Either String) where
01:26:50 <kowey> things blow up, (i think) because "you cannot make instances out of non-fully applied type synonyms"
01:26:58 <kowey> so i try making a newtype
01:27:05 <kowey> newtype EitherStr a = EitherStr (Either String a) 
01:27:05 <kowey> instance Monad (EitherStr) where
01:27:23 <kowey>   return x = EitherStr (Right x)
01:27:23 <kowey>   EitherStr (Left  s) >>= _ = EitherStr (Left s)
01:27:23 <kowey>   EitherStr (Right x) >>= f = f x
01:27:23 <kowey>   fail s   = EitherStr (Left s)
01:27:25 <kowey> ...
01:27:28 <kowey> do i sound sane?
01:28:17 <kowey> cleverdra: thanks (saturday night i was starting to feel a sense of general embarrassment in the room :-)
01:28:53 <shapr> I tend to ask stupid questions on a regular basis, and I've been here a looong time.
01:29:54 <kowey> well, i don't think it was the stupidity of my questions that bothered me, but my incessant struggling
01:33:43 <earthy> it's part of learning the stuff
01:34:43 <kowey> nod... i'm hoping actually trying to use the language will clear things up for me
01:35:08 <kowey> anyway, monads... (this is Yet Another Haskell Tutorial i'm using)
01:35:45 <kowey> am i missing something, or is it not possible to directly make an Either String instance of anything?
01:37:09 * earthy thinks you are correct
01:37:50 <kowey> ... hmm that's reassuring; i wonder if Hal Daume hangs out here?
01:38:30 <shapr> he does sometimes
01:38:33 <shapr> haven't seen him lately
01:39:32 <kowey> ok... i'll be sure to bug him with a "you didn't really mean that, did you?"
01:39:56 <kowey> sigh... that's the price of doing something useful (writing a tutorial); people bug you afterwards
01:39:59 <cleverdra> kowey - what problems do you have with that 'instance' ?
01:40:15 <kowey> in hugs:
01:40:16 <kowey> ERROR Monads.hs:54 - syntax error in instance head (variable expected)
01:40:25 <kowey> in ghci:
01:40:36 <kowey> Monads.hs:54:
01:40:36 <kowey>     Illegal instance declaration for `Monad (Either String)'
01:40:36 <kowey>         (The instance type must be of form (T a b c)
01:40:36 <kowey>          where T is not a synonym, and a,b,c are distinct type variables)
01:40:36 <kowey>     In the instance declaration for `Monad (Either String)'
01:41:01 <shapr> well, Either takes two parameters
01:41:19 <earthy> so it'd be instance Monad (Either String a)
01:41:40 <earthy> somehow I've done something silly though: eitherstring.hs:1:
01:41:40 <earthy>     Couldn't match `* -> *' against `*'
01:41:40 <earthy>         Expected kind: (* -> *) -> *
01:41:40 <earthy>         Inferred kind: * -> k
01:41:40 <earthy>     When checking kinds in `Monad (Either String a)'
01:41:48 <earthy> (and thank you ghci)
01:42:01 <cleverdra> kowey - I don't get an error with hugs.  Perhaps you want to enable a GHC extension for polymorphic instances?
01:42:23 <kowey> polymorphic instances
01:42:40 * kowey does ghci --help
01:44:14 <kowey> ok, hugs -98 made the difference
01:44:27 <kowey> so, polymorphic instances is a haskell 98 feature?
01:45:55 <earthy> hm. interesting. yeah.
01:46:42 <kowey> but funny then that GHCI doesn't like it
01:46:44 <earthy> 'kay. in Haskell98 instance Monad (Either String) is *not* allowed.
01:46:55 <shapr> is it because of overlapping instances?
01:47:00 <earthy> however, if you turn on glasgow extensions it is.
01:47:04 <shapr> ohh
01:47:25 <kowey> ... hmm
01:47:33 <earthy> shapr: not really. it is because the instance *must* be of the form (Tycon var var var var)
01:48:43 <kowey> ok, confirm that ghci -fglasgow-exts likes it
01:49:06 <kowey> any reason why i *should not* take advantage of these extensions? seems to make code simpler
01:49:28 <earthy> because nhc might not like them.
01:51:22 <shapr> at the most recent international conference on functional programming, one page of a presentatin said "Is Haskell defined by GHC?"
01:51:57 <shapr> the Haskell 98 standard leaves out a bunch of neat tricks that GHC can do.
01:52:07 <shapr> Haskell 2 hasn't been started that I'm aware of...
01:53:05 <shapr> if you use the really cool and powerful GHC extensions, your might be very difficult to port to another implementation of Haskell
01:53:24 <ibid> and in some cases to another version of ghc
01:53:27 <cleverdra> Concurrent Haskell, Template Haskell.
01:53:29 <shapr> (for example HaskellDB is *really* cool, but required Trex which only works on Hugs)
01:53:37 <kowey> nod
01:53:44 <earthy> allowing Either String for a class instance requires stronger kind inference
01:53:50 <earthy> e.g.
01:53:51 <kowey> ah right, when i did "hugs -98" that meant "not Haskell98?"
01:54:11 * earthy nods
01:54:12 <cleverdra> kowey - er, no.  Compare 'hugs -98', 'hugs +98', and what hugs tells you interactively =)
01:54:24 <cleverdra> kowey - also, 'yes' =)  Sorry.
01:54:39 <kowey> ok, so in the beginning there was Haskell
01:54:53 <kowey> Then came Haskell 98, which everyone implements by default
01:55:07 <shapr> right, it's the standard.
01:55:13 <kowey> and now if i do hugs -98 or ghci -fglasgow-exts, i get not yet standard extensions
01:55:20 <cleverdra> kowey - welcome to languages with standards =)
01:55:28 <kowey> :-)
01:55:37 <shapr> right, there's something like 'Haskell Plus' which means Haskell 98 and the really common extensions.
01:55:49 <kowey> and so, when H.D. wrote his tutorial and tested his solution, he likely forgot that he was running in Haskell Plus instead of 98
01:55:54 <earthy> kowey: if you code up to the common denominator that you enable with -98 or -fglasgow-exts, you're pretty safe.
01:56:42 <kowey> ok, but i'll be even more conservative for now; thanks for the help/soothing, everyone!
01:57:28 <shapr> I'd recommend you learn all the cool extensions, they can do amazing stuff, but that you also keep in mind that h98 is the standard.
01:57:43 <shapr> for example, I think nhc will have a runtime on PalmOS at some point
01:58:27 <kowey> ooh fun! i knew all that palm i got on ebay would come in handy
01:58:30 <shapr> heh
01:58:44 <shapr> and -fglasgow-exts is not going to work on nhc
02:04:41 <earthy> and checking the ghc docs tells me that it *is* because of overlapping instances
02:04:58 * earthy takes the lart and applies it liberally to its own ass
02:05:07 <earthy> s/tis/his/
02:05:56 <earthy> anyhow, if you have a compiler allowing overlapping instances you ought to be safe with instance Monad (Either String)
02:06:25 <kowey> i suppose that's another point
02:06:31 <kowey> if i use a compiler anyway, 
02:06:47 <kowey> then i'd just be handing someone a binary, so i could just go wild
02:07:07 <kowey> wild within limits
02:07:33 <earthy> oh, you could just use it in the source and documenting `this shite needs overlapping instances'
02:07:36 <shapr> right, if you suddenly want to port your app to nhc on PalmOS, you may have to rip out anything past Haskell Plus
02:08:12 <kowey> or hope that nhc decides to adopt their own set of not-yet-standard extensions :-)
02:08:39 <earthy> (note, this is what quite a bit of the uu.nl stuff does)
02:08:49 <earthy> kowey: :)
02:09:01 <shapr> of course, uu.nl has UHC
02:09:23 <shapr> let's see; nhc, hbc, ghc, uhc, hugs, helium, ?
02:09:41 <shapr> I think I've forgotten one.
02:12:24 <earthy> well, UHC isn't really out yet
02:12:31 <earthy> afaik
02:12:46 <earthy> but I think you've got them all, ther.e
02:13:51 <earthy> nope! :) vital
02:14:20 <earthy> (thank you, HC&A)
02:14:37 <shapr> :-)
02:15:35 <kowey> anyway... guess i ought to get back to the tutorial
02:15:38 <kowey> thanks again, folks, bye

03:26:51 <shapr> hey anth
03:28:29 <swisscheese> Hi Darius
03:35:07 <swisscheese> Can someone give a newbie some direction. I'm coding something like the chess knights tour. Trying to build a tree of board positions without duplicate subtrees. Member Bring suggested keeping a list of board positions encountered so far in each node. That avoids duplicate subtrees in one ancestral line but not across the tree. So I need the "prior position" list essentially as a "static" ala C. Can't see how to do it in H.
03:35:50 <ibid> you could do it using state monads
03:36:26 <ibid> or you could see if you could build the whole tree lazily, tying the knot where subtrees are shared
03:36:27 <swisscheese> Haven't used monads yet - I suppose I could read up on them. Any other ideas.
03:36:39 <ibid> don't know if that makes sense with board position trees
03:38:27 <ibid> you could also represent the tree using a finite map: give each node a unique id and store its child information in a tree-global finite map keyed by the ids
03:38:28 <swisscheese> I though everything is lazy.
03:38:31 <ibid> i believe that
03:38:33 <ibid> ...
03:38:39 <ibid> of course everything is lazy
03:38:43 <ibid> but you can exploit it
03:39:37 <ibid> by building the _whole_ tree; note that due to laziness you will actually build it only so far as you access it
03:40:10 <ibid> sort of a producer-consumer pattern
03:40:49 <swisscheese> You are a bit beyond me - I only have about 250 lines of H code experience so far.
03:41:38 <ibid> yes; there is no simple answer
03:42:02 <ibid> the state monad one is probably easiest to comprehend, because it's essentially imperative
03:42:50 <ibid> the lazy building with knot-tying is probably the most idiomatic if it is appropriate to your problem; but it twists your brain pretty hard
03:42:53 <swisscheese> I'd prefer to stay pure since I am trying to learn FP.
03:43:59 <swisscheese> What is knot-tying?
03:44:01 <ibid> in that case, if i were in your position, i'd  probably try the finite map approach
03:44:42 <swisscheese> tree-global?
03:44:56 <ibid> http://haskell.org/hawiki/TyingTheKnot
03:45:20 <ibid> tree-global: global to the tree, ie. one finite map for the whole tree
03:49:22 <swisscheese> Yes, if I coujld have a global I could make it a list of visited positions but don't see how to make globals in general.
03:49:49 <ibid> you can't make a mutable global outside monads
03:49:50 <swisscheese> Thanks for the URL - I'll study it.
03:50:10 <ibid> but you can pass a shared data structure as parameters
03:50:17 <swisscheese> OK - seems I need to read up on the URL and monads - thanks.
03:50:27 <ibid> and thus end up with a pseudo-global :)
04:08:30 <shapr> hi Jad
04:08:36 <shapr> how's life?
04:08:40 <Jad> hello
04:08:46 <Jad> fine
04:08:56 <Jad> long time no see...
04:09:05 <shapr> yes, life is busy.
04:10:13 <Jad> you had a new implimentation of smtp
04:10:17 <Jad> did you impliment it ?
04:10:33 <shapr> no, I didn't
04:10:47 <Jad> okay
04:10:52 <shapr> I got ditracted.
04:11:09 <shapr> distracted
04:11:21 <Jad> done any thing lately ?
04:11:37 <shapr> I've been playing with fun wiki tricks - http://www.scannedinavian.org/AvianWiki/HaddockTest
04:12:20 <shapr> I've been using a recently released Haskell XmlRpc library to talk to Zope.
04:12:49 <shapr> have you done anything lately?
04:12:55 <Jad> lots of things
04:12:57 <Jad> i have to go now..
04:12:59 <shapr> ok
04:13:05 <Jad> i will join some time later 2nite
04:13:07 <Jad> bye.
04:13:11 <shapr> bye
05:11:35 * shapr yawns
05:12:13 <darius-> heh, still awake, eh?
05:12:42 <shapr> vaguely
05:15:10 <malik> somebody got hugs running under mac os x? i use apples x tools with this gcc variant.... trying to compile hugs gives warnings at compiling machine.o and later fails.
05:15:16 <malik> sorry if this is offtopic
05:15:23 <shapr> sounds on-topic to me
05:15:42 <apmuf> mh
05:15:49 <apmuf> we got mac os x in school
05:15:52 <apmuf> works fine
05:16:29 <malik> mhm...
05:16:50 <apmuf> i never compiled it myself though :O
05:16:54 <malik> perhaps there is a 'native' version? i took the version for generic unix
05:17:09 <malik> apmuf: well, u know a place where i could download binaries?
05:17:49 <apmuf> nope
05:17:51 <apmuf> dunno 
05:18:01 <apmuf> our teacher did all that shit
05:18:28 <malik> mhm...
05:44:46 <shapr> malik: you could ask on the hugs users list
05:52:58 <Segora> re
05:53:11 <shapr> hi Segora 
05:53:15 <Segora> strange, that bouncing
05:54:57 <shapr> yup
05:55:42 <shapr> :-)
05:57:00 <shapr> maybe someone is using dsniff on you?
05:57:12 <Segora> hmm
05:57:16 <Segora> what's dsniff?
05:58:05 <shapr> http://monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/
05:59:09 <Segora> well, I don't think that would hurt my current connection
05:59:41 <Segora> .. which is 100Mbps with multi-Gbps uplink
06:01:02 <Segora> 25ms rtt to sterling doesn't look too bad either
06:04:52 <earthy> malik: hugs is in fink (albeit at an old version)
06:15:49 <Segora> grmbl
06:25:58 <earthy> oh, and malik: edit config.h so that it does define HAVE_LIBM
06:26:10 <earthy> (configure doesn't seem to want to detect that nicely)
06:27:57 <rey[lx]> hey guys
06:28:10 <rey[lx]> did any of you something with hopengl?
06:30:35 <Segora> yes, but I gave it up half a year ago and decided to wait for a working debian package and working examples.
06:30:52 <earthy> well, those exist, currently, IIRC
06:31:09 <Segora> maybe I should give it another try now...
06:31:51 <earthy> ;)
06:31:58 <rey[lx]> hmm, how is it with the performance, are there any good examples? i googled a bit but didnt find bvery much
06:32:14 <rey[lx]> just thinking about wether doing my project in python c++ or haskell
06:33:11 <earthy> hm. unfortunately it still won't compile...
06:33:23 <earthy> somethings rotten in the state of hugs on MacOS X
06:40:38 <shapr> rey[lx]: from the comparisons I've heard of, Haskell is about seven times slower than C, and that's still lots faster than Python.
06:41:06 <rey[lx]> jep, python lacks alot of speed
06:41:11 <rey[lx]> espacially pygame
06:41:20 <shapr> pygame is easy to use though.
06:41:37 <shapr> anyways, I'm finally going to sleep now.
06:41:40 * shapr disappears.
06:42:27 <rey[lx]> good n8
06:42:44 <rey[lx]> thats what it is for sure..
06:42:51 <rey[lx]> and the syntax is ncier than anything else
06:44:24 <Igloo> For an OpenGL app I'd have thought most of the CPU time would be spent on rendering, so the choice of language was largely irrelevant from a performance PoV
06:45:32 <Igloo> Segora: If the Debian unstable packages (have a tiny example in /usr/share/doc/ghc6-hopengl/examples) don't work then please let me know or file a bug!
06:45:59 <rey[lx]> igloo: there are big differences in performance!!
06:46:09 <rey[lx]> just didnt know exactly how fast haskell was
06:46:41 <Igloo> rey: In the same (non-trivial) opengl program in various languages?
06:47:21 <rey[lx]> i only tested some of the nehe lessons
06:48:11 <rey[lx]> in c++ i coded some simple landscape renderer and it ran with about 400fps with 1000 polys
06:48:15 <rey[lx]> (me has 3ghz)
06:48:42 <rey[lx]> and the nehe opengl example with a textured cube didnt even get near the 400 in python
06:49:00 <Igloo> I'd expect rendering time to dominate. Plus you'll probably be avoiding the particular slow areas of GHC, so it should compare even more favourably.
06:49:10 <Segora> Igloo: the cube example works. Thank you, this was the first positive experience with HOpenGL
06:49:18 <Igloo> Cool  :-)
06:49:20 <rey[lx]> hehe
06:50:06 <earthy> Igloo: if you have a *good* OpenGL implementation and reasonable 3D hardware much of the rendering will be done in hardware
06:50:17 <earthy> that is one of the basics behind OpenGL, really, allowing that.
06:50:44 <earthy> note that I don't consider Mesa to be a good OpenGL implementation where it comes to that. ;)
08:18:33 <ski> Good evening #haskell !
08:36:25 <SyntaxNinja> hi ski
08:36:39 <ski> hi SyntaxNinja
11:47:50 * esap blinks.
14:00:19 <earthy> Z
14:00:54 <opet> moo
14:02:49 * ibid chuckles at opet's nick
14:03:43 <opet> is it chuckle worthy?
14:04:06 <ibid> it's colloquial spoken finnish for 'teachers'
14:04:40 <opet> oh
14:04:45 <opet> I never knew that :)
14:05:13 <ibid> (actually, 'the teachers'
14:05:14 <ibid> )
14:09:55 <jasonw> I have it out of fink.
14:10:02 <jasonw> whoops, sorry.
14:34:07 * esap tries to create a silver bullet.
15:56:05 <ski> hi unxn
16:36:57 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: alive?
16:38:14 <Igloo> I have a pulse, certainly
16:38:25 <SyntaxLaptop> glad to hear it!
16:38:32 <SyntaxLaptop> OK, so my brain finally got around to your email.
16:38:42 <SyntaxLaptop> I'll have to work on my turnaround time for these things...
16:39:31 <SyntaxLaptop> here's the thing: I'd like a tool where you only have to give the barest of information (the source files for a haskell module, for instance) and it builds everything in order
16:39:32 <Igloo> np - I'm sure I'm generally worse than you  :-)
16:39:51 <SyntaxLaptop> but I want to minimize external calls, in paritcular, it would be nice to just call the compiler itself.
16:40:04 <SyntaxLaptop> that's why the original plan was to API-ize hmake
16:40:27 * Igloo wonders how hmake actually copes with ghc -cpp
16:41:34 <SyntaxLaptop> but we'd want it to be powerful and extensible, ie to be able to do preprocessors (not just the ones it already knows about, like hmake does) so one idea for how to accomplish this was to create a make-like embedded-dsl in Haskell
16:41:49 <Igloo> hmake is presumably less extensible by the library writer, e.g. it would not be possible to add support for Parser.hs being generated by a happy parser if it doesn't exist, too
16:42:17 <SyntaxLaptop> right
16:42:48 <Igloo> An EDSL wouldn't allow you to give shell commands as nicely as a DSL
16:43:34 <SyntaxLaptop> do you mean by "give shell commands", embed shell commands in your script?
16:44:08 <Igloo> I mean the "gcc -c $< -o $@" bit of a make rule
16:45:03 <SyntaxLaptop> hm..
16:45:11 <SyntaxLaptop> you mean because of the substitution variables & such
16:45:14 <Igloo> Also the "%.o: %.c" bit would be ugly
16:45:26 <Igloo> Yeah - even just multiline strings aren't pretty
16:46:01 <SyntaxLaptop> hmm
16:47:11 <SyntaxLaptop> I'm going to go eat pizza, will you be here in like 0.5 hours?
16:47:29 <SyntaxLaptop> is it like 1AM where you are? :)
16:47:29 <Igloo> Plus you'd have to be able to compile the Makefile-program, which might require other libraries  :-)
16:47:41 <Igloo> Probably and yes
16:47:45 <SyntaxLaptop> well, that's part of the LIP which is already there.
16:48:43 <SyntaxLaptop> OK brb
17:25:54 <SamB> boy, seirpinski gasket is simple in haskell!
17:28:40 <SamB> heh, I accidentally caused a parabola of commas to be drawn
17:29:20 <SamB> or something much like one, at least
17:37:48 <SamB> seirpinski n = take (bit n) gasket where gasket = [1::Integer] ++ (map step gasket); step x = xor (shift x 1) x
17:45:30 <SamB> bin 0 = "0"; bin n = bin_ n where bin_ 0 = ""; bin_ n = bin_ (n `shift` (-1)) ++ case (n .&. 1) of 0 -> "0"; 1 -> "1"
17:48:37 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: back.
17:49:47 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: OK, so I'm not sure I agree about the substitution variables
17:51:26 <SyntaxLaptop> hmm. maybe "gcc " ++ foo ++ bar ++ "-o" or whatever does kinda suck
17:53:55 <Igloo> You also have to bind them somehow in the first place
17:54:03 <SyntaxLaptop> foo and bar?
17:54:11 * Igloo is going to reboot the ADSL router - should be back in a flash
17:54:16 <SyntaxLaptop> ok
17:54:23 <SamB> bins = (foldr (++) []) . (map ((++"\n").bin)); bins :: (Bits a) => [a] -> [Char]
17:55:59 <SamB> main = putStr (bins (seirpinski 6))
17:57:09 <SamB> you can't do that in Perl, can you?
17:58:09 <Igloo> Yes, binding foo and bar. I guess it's not too bad if you use regexps though, so maybe the substituting them into commands is going to be the uglier bit.
17:59:00 <SyntaxLaptop> but really, what's so bad about that? you gotta write logic to parse those strings in your system too, right?
17:59:05 <SyntaxLaptop> and do the substitutions.
17:59:27 <SyntaxLaptop> > sh "gcc -c $< -o $@"
18:00:46 <SyntaxLaptop> I guess sh's type will have to be a monad to carry the bindings
18:05:30 <Igloo> True, you could do something like that
18:06:09 <Igloo> I'm not sure what it gains you over a non-E DSL though?
18:07:17 <SyntaxLaptop> I picture this tuple (API, EDSL)
18:07:43 <SyntaxLaptop> nicely integrated
18:07:46 <SyntaxLaptop> ...
18:08:04 <SyntaxLaptop> a lot like parsec
18:08:31 <SyntaxLaptop> I want to use an API because I don't like the indirection of generating a makefile, then executing an external program
18:11:54 <SyntaxLaptop> but for more complicated stuff, I think a "makefile" will be necessary, hence the EDSL
18:13:24 <Igloo> Fair enough, I give in  :-)
18:13:51 <SyntaxLaptop> are you just saying that because it's after 1AM? :)
18:14:02 <SyntaxLaptop> if not
18:14:05 * SyntaxLaptop dances around in glee
18:14:33 <SyntaxLaptop> the build system part of the proposal is the one I'm the most scared of, so I really want someone (like you!) who is into making something that works
18:14:40 <Igloo> It's after 2am, but I'm saying it because I don't think you are wrong as such and I don't think you'll change your mind  :-)
18:15:30 <SyntaxLaptop> ahh, but the question is, can I convince you enough to get you to keep working on kompile, but to make it a perfect fit for LIP
18:15:35 <Igloo> I'm not likely to do what you want in the very near future
18:15:36 <SyntaxLaptop> (and still be excited about it :) )
18:15:44 <SyntaxLaptop> d'oh!
18:16:59 <Igloo> Well, it depends how close to where I'm going it is actually. I'll add variables to Kompile first and then think harder, I think.
18:19:02 <SyntaxLaptop> I think it can go in the direction you want it to go... I think we can make the core exactly what you already picture, but on the edges, I want haskell-specific stuff
18:19:11 <SyntaxLaptop> and I think other programming languages will want their own kinda stuff
18:19:24 <SyntaxLaptop> that's the nice thing about an edsl, of course, the fact that it is as powerful as a real programming language.
18:19:55 <Igloo> But if you call external programs to do the hard work you can use different languages for different bits
18:20:40 <SyntaxLaptop> but you get that too, of course, with a real programming language
18:21:52 <SyntaxLaptop> OK, I'll stop harassing you.  I'm just worried about having too many unique efforts going in different directions (GHC-based build system, yale build system, hmake, kompile, and LIP)
18:22:28 <SyntaxLaptop> that's why my goal was to attack hmake and turn it into what I want.
18:25:13 <Igloo> *nod*
18:28:36 * SyntaxLaptop dances around igloo with the energy that only a different time-zone can offer
18:28:47 <Cale> heh
18:31:10 <Igloo> :-)
19:49:43 <ski> quit
19:49:58 <ski> end
20:21:55 <shapr> @yow
20:21:56 <lambdabot> All this time I've been VIEWING a RUSSIAN MIDGET SODOMIZE a HOUSECAT!
20:28:51 <Lemmih> say what?
20:30:12 <shapr> hi Lemmih 
20:30:22 <shapr> isn't it 5:30am where you live?
20:32:24 <Lemmih> yeah
20:33:48 <shapr> man that's early
20:33:56 <Lemmih> No. It's late :)
20:34:06 <shapr> right, that too
20:34:36 <Lemmih> No job + no school = weird sleep habits.
20:34:56 <shapr> I have a job and I still have weird sleep habits.
20:35:42 <Lemmih> You work at home?
20:36:18 <shapr> yup
20:36:34 <Lemmih> Lucky bastard :-)
20:36:36 <shapr> I write code for people in other countries and other timezones.
20:36:47 <shapr> it has sucky bits
20:37:51 <Lemmih> It must be heaven to be a professional programmer.
20:38:07 <shapr> I love it, no arguments there.
20:38:21 <Lemmih> So what's the down side?
20:38:41 <shapr> working at home means you don't have any programmer coworkers
20:38:48 <shapr> at least, it does in my case.
20:39:27 <Lemmih> I _so_ hope I can get a job as a programmer when I'm done with highschool.
20:39:28 <shapr> A workplace can offer you social opportunities, and learning opportunities. I don't have either of those side-effects.
20:40:02 <shapr> Of course, I get a lot less interruptions, and the dress code is very relaxed.
20:40:26 <Lemmih> Does it pay good?
20:40:35 <shapr> if you keep learning about programming and doing programming, I'm sure you can get a job.
20:41:01 <shapr> It can pay really well, but there's a balance between fun and money. You rarely get both in the same job.
20:41:57 <shapr> I get to write Python, which is my second favorite language, but I have to accept about the same amount of money I was making in Seattle four or five years ago.
20:42:16 <shapr> If I wrote C++ for Win32 I could make lots more money with far less work.
20:42:56 <Lemmih> I've been wasting 3 years on C coding before I head about Haskell.
20:43:15 <shapr> it's not a waste, C is a very important language to know.
20:44:47 <Lemmih> How old are you?
20:45:02 <shapr> I'm 32
20:45:06 <shapr> how old are you?
20:45:19 <Lemmih> I just turned 17.
20:45:36 <shapr> I started programming BASIC when I was 12
20:47:00 <Lemmih> My first language was C (my dad had some C books which I borrowed).
20:47:44 <shapr> that's a good place to start
20:47:44 <shapr> I wish I'd started with something other than BASIC
20:47:44 <shapr> I doubt I could have easily found anything else though.
20:47:44 <shapr> There weren't any free compilers.
20:47:54 <shapr> I was dying to use a real compiled language to learn the differences and strengths.
20:48:59 <Lemmih> So for how long have you been programming Haskell?
20:49:22 <shapr> about 2 years, 40 weeks
20:50:02 <shapr> I haven't put as much time into it as I would like, since I do it in my spare time.
20:50:20 <shapr> but hopefully Bjorn's xml-rpc code will let me integrate Haskell and my daily paying work.
20:50:29 <shapr> how long have you been writing Haskell?
20:51:02 <Lemmih> Less than a week :(
20:52:09 <shapr> you have lots of neat stuff ahead of you then.
20:52:26 <shapr> many wonderful mental toys to play with
20:53:15 <Lemmih> I have about 5 months until school starts to I have plenty of time :)
20:54:00 <shapr> I thought school was out during the summer?
20:54:57 <Lemmih> Well I took a one year break between primary school and highschool.
20:55:34 <shapr> ah, good time to learn some programming, I agree.
20:55:40 <shapr> have you started reading the tutorials?
20:56:56 <Lemmih> yeah I've been reading a lot. And I've been coding some small programs too.
20:57:23 <Lemmih> I'm currently working on a 'shortest path' algorithm.
20:57:24 <shapr> do you have any questions?
20:57:26 <shapr> ah, neat
20:57:38 <Lemmih> But it's _really_ difficult.
20:58:16 <shapr> it is?
20:58:45 <Lemmih> I've been working on a MicroMachines2 (It's an old dos game) clone for Linux before I heard about Haskell and now I'm trying to rewrite it in Haskell.
20:59:15 <shapr> I haven't seen MicroMachines2
20:59:46 <Lemmih> It's my favorite dos game :)
21:00:28 <Lemmih> Here's the project page: http://minimachines.sf.net
21:00:33 <liiwi> morning
21:00:43 <shapr> hei liiwi 
21:00:52 <shapr> hyv‰‰ huomenta
21:00:57 <liiwi> kuten my√∂s
21:01:32 <Lemmih> shapr: I didn't receive your last message...
21:02:44 <shapr> it was finnish :-)
21:02:55 <shapr> nynne's splash screen is nice
21:03:18 <Lemmih> Uh... maybe that's why I got a "error converting this message" error. :)
21:03:20 <shapr> the screenshots for minimachines look nice
21:03:38 * shapr stabs arch
21:04:45 <shapr> darcs is easier to use than arch
21:10:40 <Lemmih> What's darcs and arch?
21:11:11 <shapr> they're both version control systems
21:11:32 <shapr> cvs has some problems, so some other people have written alternatives.
21:12:21 <Lemmih> Ahh "David's Advanced Revision Control System" Heh `emerge -s darcs` did the trick :)
21:12:44 <shapr> I like darcs
21:12:46 <shapr> it's cool
21:20:05 * shapr looks at the LIP sources
21:20:49 <shapr> are there nhc debs?
21:28:52 <Lemmih> Are there a major different between nhc and ghc?
21:34:03 <shapr> yes, there are
21:38:44 <Lemmih> Could you specify on what key issues they differ?
21:39:19 <shapr> from what I've heard, nhc was designed to run in very little space
21:39:35 <shapr> it sacrifices speed but gives small size
21:39:58 <shapr> ghc is a research compiler, it often has new and experimental features that can do really neat stuff
21:40:31 <shapr> ghc can be a pig, but you get other stuff in return
