00:24:18 * Lunar^ met shapr :)
00:24:33 <andersca> woo
00:24:36 <andersca> are you at chalmers now?
00:24:53 <Lunar^> yeah :)
00:24:58 <andersca> cool
00:25:05 <Lunar^> He's sitting next to me in fact :)
00:25:18 <andersca> oh, cool
00:25:22 <andersca> what building are you in?
00:28:49 <Pseudonym> Hang on... shapr is next to you but he's not HERE?
00:29:05 <Pseudonym> Or do you only have one computer handy?
00:29:10 <andersca> :)
00:29:38 <Lunar^> He don't have a laptop
00:36:36 <bringert> hi Lunar^, welcome to gothenburg
00:37:18 <bringert> say hi to shapr
00:37:50 <bringert> where are you guys going for lunch?
00:40:48 <Pseudonym> Must away.  Nytol!
00:47:18 <Lunar^> bringert: dunno
00:49:32 <bringert> Lunar^: when's your lunch? wanna meet up somewhere?
00:53:24 <bringert> chucky just sent me an sms, said he was going to have lunch with you guys around 12 in the student union restaurant
00:53:38 <andersca> mmmm, lunch
00:53:49 <bringert> andersca: you coming?
00:53:59 <andersca> bringert: sure, why not
00:54:11 <andersca> not like it's far away for me :)
00:54:14 <bringert> yikes, it's raining
00:54:23 <andersca> yay!
00:54:33 * andersca is happy, temperature wise
00:58:42 * ozone waves to Lunar^ and shapr
00:58:51 <ozone> Lunar^: make sure you drop by uppsala!
00:58:57 <bringert> haha
00:59:00 <andersca> :)
00:59:03 <ozone> it has very, very, very nice views
00:59:18 <andersca> ozone: what about models and controllers?
00:59:43 <ozone> andersca: sure, i'd like those views to be models, and i wouldn't mind controlling them anytime
01:00:07 <andersca> god we have nerdish humor...
01:00:31 <ozone> i prefer to think of my humour as 'gutter' rather than 'nerdy'
01:01:46 <ozone> but i'm usually well behaved.  ask shapr!
01:13:39 <andersca> hmm
01:13:45 * andersca looks around for darcs experts
01:14:01 <bringert> look in #darcs
01:14:38 <andersca> bringert: thanks
01:43:25 <andersca> @type Monad.liftM
01:43:28 <lambdabot> Monad.liftM :: forall r m a1. (Monad m) => (a1 -> r) -> m a1 -> m r
05:15:05 <Philippa> stupid question: in (GHC 6.2's) ST monad, are STRefs GCed?
05:15:38 <Philippa> or rather, the memory they refer to?
05:15:54 <ozone> Philippa: i'm 99.9% sure they are
05:17:26 <Philippa> I'd hope so :-)
05:17:53 <ozone> Philippa: rather, they are GC'ed unless you have some sort of space leak going on
05:18:08 <Philippa> 'sjust I've got some ported modula-2 where the original code was extremely sloppy about memory management ("the runtime'll free it all on termination")
05:18:23 * Philippa nods
05:18:34 <Philippa> I should be able to avoid too much of that. Really it's just unification
05:20:26 <ozone> well, you don't need to watch memory in haskell unless you start interfacing with foreign functions, or you run into a scenario where laziness goes crazy
05:20:33 <ozone> but i assume you know that already :)
05:21:47 <Philippa> indeed
05:23:29 <Philippa> most of my code doesn't really make that much use of laziness atm - a bad habit, I suppose, but hey
05:23:48 <Philippa> the exception'd be where a monad needs it to fit together
05:25:09 <Jerub> code termination is a perfectly valid form of garbage collection.
05:25:28 <Jerub> but as one can understand, it is less than an optimal form of gc.
05:26:13 <Philippa> obviously in practice I need the garbage collected if the heap's full of crap too
05:26:36 <Philippa> hence my question being geared towards an implementation :-)
06:24:59 <blackdog> anyone know how to make sure that a list of values is fully evaluated?
06:28:30 <ozone> blackdog: deepseq?
06:37:34 <blackdog> cheers ozone
06:37:44 <blackdog> we got ants running all over the place. :)
06:39:22 <Lunar^> bringert: still around?
06:45:25 <ozone> blackdog: i love ants.  i used to play simant lots when i was younger
06:55:46 <blackdog> shoulda done icfp this year. you had, what, 3 papers? Suck it up and stop being such a whiny little baby.
07:03:19 <ozone> blackdog: yes mr. patryk keller
07:03:35 <ozone> oh, what's that?  oh, that's right, that's the sound of you being ARRRRRROWED
07:19:00 <Lor> This year's contest task is the coolest ever.
07:19:32 <Lor> Too big for a single person in three days, though.
07:24:46 <SyntaxNinja> multi-thread programming in haskell is so......... stateful
07:25:31 <andersca> hey Lunar^
07:25:46 <andersca> Lunar^: bringert is probably in a void somewhere
07:44:26 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: um, yeah, you expect otherwise? :-)
07:44:59 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: I have a right to complain! ;)
07:45:08 <SyntaxNinja> (this is IRC, after all)
08:37:03 <shaleh> morning all
08:40:07 <SyntaxNinja> hi shaleh
08:49:33 <Philippa> d'oh
08:49:50 <Philippa> that's *twice* I thought there was a bug in my H-M typechecker and it turned out to be in the code that prints out the inferred type
08:50:22 <shaleh> sucks when that kinda thing happens
08:50:39 <Philippa> yeah, I only went through the entire checker first
09:02:43 * arjanb has seen enough ants for at least a year
09:02:52 <Lor> Oh?
09:02:53 <shaleh> heh
09:03:02 <shaleh> how'd the competition go?
09:03:16 <Lor> I thought this was so cool that I and some friends at the local department are considering playing it some more by ourselves.
09:03:18 <Lukhas> next year, they should use bees
09:03:25 <shaleh> Lor: indeed
09:04:31 <d3z> Ugh, icfp contest entry submitted, the last hour was probably the most stressful I've had in a long, long time.
09:04:39 <shaleh> I was unable to hack on it this weekend.  But it sounds like a fun problem to explore.
09:04:50 <Lor> I wish I had had a team.
09:05:12 <Lor> This is such an optimal team project.
09:05:13 <shaleh> so, you guys submitted in haskell?
09:05:19 <Lor> ocaml
09:05:20 <d3z> We submitted two very different entries.
09:05:24 <d3z> Haskell...
09:05:29 <shaleh> Lor: definitely.  One guy for the sim, someone else for testing, etc.
09:05:58 <d3z> First day: me-sim, tim-visualizer, droundy-ant1.
09:05:59 <Lor> one guy for sim, second for gui, third for compiler, fourth for the actual ants :)
09:06:24 <d3z> Then, I started working on a completely different ant, while time and droundy worked on the first one.
09:06:54 <d3z> I ended up creating a heavily checked ant creation monad.  It was very useful.
09:06:55 * Heffalump recovers
09:07:02 * Heffalump had an ant creation monad too
09:07:13 <Heffalump> I was half-wishing I'd made an arrow.
09:07:14 <d3z> Any idea on how many haskell entries?
09:07:19 <Heffalump> US!
09:07:33 <d3z> I'm not familiar with arrows, so that would have been a hindrance.
09:07:50 <Heffalump> I don't think many people are very familiar with arrow syntax, which wouldn't have helped.
09:07:54 <d3z> We also used darcs to coordinate our work.  It worked quite well.
09:07:57 <Heffalump> And I'm not _THAT_ familiar with them.
09:08:01 <Heffalump> we found some bugs in it.
09:08:01 <Lor> I considered arrows today. Would have used them, had I used haskell.
09:08:17 <Heffalump> so, do people want to exchange ants?
09:08:17 <Lor> But I managed with a simple DSL even in ocaml.
09:08:44 <d3z> Both of our ants used a monad.  One with heavy internal checking, and the other not.
09:09:01 <d3z> I'd love to try other ants.
09:09:15 <d3z> BTW, how fast is your sim?  Ours felt slow, but I didn't want to spend time figuring out why.
09:09:21 <Heffalump> ours was horribly slow
09:09:22 <Lor> My sim was too slow.
09:09:29 <Lor> I spent far too much time on it.
09:09:34 <Heffalump> 3 minutes to do a complete run
09:09:40 <Lor> No sorry, the _sim_ was fast: 5000 rounds per second.
09:09:42 <Heffalump> and double that if you wanted to visualize afterwards
09:09:44 <Lor> But the _Gui_ was slow.
09:09:46 <Lor> It used gnomecanvas.
09:09:48 <d3z> Mine ran in about 20 seconds.
09:09:49 <Heffalump> our GUI was slow too.
09:10:02 <Heffalump> d3z: written in Haskell?
09:10:04 <d3z> My gui was slow, especially for me, since my x display is remote.  Our visualizer was in opengl.
09:10:19 <d3z> Yes, in haskell.  But it looks very imperative.
09:11:23 <d3z> I considered ocaml for the sim, but Lor's sounds about the same speed.
09:12:00 <arjanb> the problem with this task was you have no idea how good your ant actually is
09:12:19 <shaleh> indeed
09:12:25 <Lor> No, that was the problem with the 2002 competition.
09:12:28 <Igloo> Did anyone have an offensive strategy?
09:12:35 <Lor> Here the environment was very clearly specified.
09:12:36 <arjanb> yes 
09:12:41 <Igloo> What did it do?
09:12:49 <shaleh> I am expecting to see many "kill the other ants, use them for food" strategies
09:12:52 <arjanb> blocking foe's hill
09:13:12 <Heffalump> http://urchin.earth.li/icfpcontest/2004/
09:13:17 <Heffalump> has our ants
09:13:24 <Heffalump> could someone give us a decent simulator and visualizer, please?
09:13:48 <d3z> We used guards to protect our hill, and steal food from enemies. (steals and drops shortly outside of hill).
09:14:03 <d3z> Let me put our submission on my webpage.  Our sim is very slow, and needs hopengl.
09:14:12 <Heffalump> ours uses wxHaskell
09:14:26 <Heffalump> did you see what I said about about 3.5 minutes for a full simulator run?
09:14:41 <Lor> How big were your ants?
09:14:46 <Heffalump> 3000-4000 states
09:16:06 <d3z> http://www.davidb.org/icfp04
09:16:51 <d3z> Our two final ants were 6188, and 1710 states, respectively.
09:16:52 <Heffalump> the MIME type of that is wrong, btw
09:16:58 <Heffalump> or the extension doesn't match it, anyway
09:17:05 <d3z> Mime type of which?
09:17:10 <Heffalump> the tar file
09:17:20 <Heffalump> at least I think it is; it confuses Mozilla, anyway
09:17:31 <d3z> Hmm, it isn't my web server.  Is there a way I can fix it with the <a> tag?
09:17:37 <Heffalump> no
09:17:43 <Heffalump> it probably doesn't matter
09:18:24 <Heffalump> which do you think is your better ant?
09:18:46 <d3z> Of ours.  The wise ant has some bugs, and does much poorer than I think it would without them.
09:19:14 <d3z> The triple ant (solution-1) seems to do quite well.
09:19:25 <shaleh> how did you guys come up with the ant states?
09:19:30 <d3z> We submitted both, since it is hard to tell what kinds of things other ants would do.
09:19:33 <Heffalump> text labels and compiled them
09:19:35 <shaleh> this sounded like a great use of genetic algos
09:19:48 <Heffalump> we couldn't have done enough trials to write a GA
09:19:57 <d3z> Genetic algos was an early thought, but with a 30second sim time, there just wasn't enough time.
09:20:12 <monotonom> mime types are controlled by web servers.  If the web server is apache, ordinary authors can have some control.
09:20:18 <d3z> One interesting point, my 'wise' ant is almost entirely deterministic.
09:20:25 <d3z> I just checked, the mime type is correct.
09:20:30 <d3z> application/x-tag
09:20:36 <d3z> sorry: application/x-tar
09:20:47 <Heffalump> for a .tar.gz file?
09:20:52 <Heffalump> in which case Mozilla is broken
09:21:13 <shaleh> or is it auto-unzipping
09:21:20 <d3z> The .gz is supposed to be an encoding, but I don't know how that gets represented.
09:21:31 <d3z> My browse is configured to just save files.
09:21:33 <Heffalump> mozilla wanted to make a file called ddt-2.tar.gz.tar
09:22:42 <d3z> gh.
09:22:45 <d3z> ugh.
09:23:30 <shaleh> this years comp seems to almost force teams of 3+
09:23:42 <shaleh> or a VERY dedicated and skilled twosome
09:24:04 <d3z> One special feature of the 'wise' ant is that all states are duplicated 6 times.  The ants keep track of their direction.
09:24:08 <monotonom> somehow http://www.davidb.org/icfp04/ddt-2.tar.gz works fine for my mozilla. tar+gz file downloaded correctly, no fudging.
09:24:37 <d3z> The monad that builds them checks all state transitions to make sure that ants are never confused about direction.
09:24:41 <Lor> You can find my silly little sketches at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lealanko/icfp/
09:25:29 <Lor> I've got a nice compiler and a bearable (but slow) gui, but I didn't have time to develop the actual _ants_. :)
09:26:23 <d3z> Heffalump - my simulator doesn't like the comments...
09:27:18 <d3z> Looks like we forgot to discard them.
09:27:39 <Heffalump> how do you return food to your base?
09:27:56 <Heffalump> we use comments to debug our ants, btw
09:28:06 <Heffalump> we're running your solution-1 against ours
09:28:13 <shaleh> what's funny is this year's comp could almost be done without using a computer.  I could see a small group doing it all by hand.
09:28:38 <Heffalump> not getting a good ant.
09:28:48 <d3z> Good ant from?
09:28:51 <Heffalump> our basic "go find food, make a trail and return with it" strategy is quite hard work.
09:28:54 <Heffalump> doing it by hand
09:29:10 <d3z> We have two strategies for returning food:
09:29:38 <d3z> first ants leave various scent trails and try to follow them back
09:29:49 <Heffalump> that's solution-1 ?
09:29:57 <d3z> the wise ants build a deterministic return path.  It would work great if it weren't for the bugs.
09:30:02 <d3z> (yes on solution-1)
09:30:09 <Heffalump> so solution-2 is the wise one?
09:30:20 <d3z> Yes.
09:30:23 <Lor> Did any of you use double trails to find the right direction?
09:30:29 <Heffalump> "double trails"?
09:30:31 <d3z> BTW, your solution-1 is creaming my wise ant.
09:30:38 <Heffalump> we have one trail pointing home, and one trail pointing to the food
09:30:46 <Heffalump> we use 0-2 for the home pointers and 3-5 for the food pointers
09:30:50 <Lor> Yes, but if you encounter one, how do you know which direction to go to?
09:31:01 <Heffalump> because it points in one specific direction
09:31:20 <Heffalump> 3 bits give us 6 directions, one state to indicate that we haven't done anything for this point yet, and one "special" indicator
09:31:49 <d3z> I used one trail, and the ants have an avoidance 'dance'.
09:32:17 <Heffalump> we have an avoidance dance too
09:32:20 <d3z> Your ant also creams our other solution, but not quite as badly.
09:32:37 <ludde> where can i see the problem specification?
09:32:40 <Heffalump> we're just watching on our simulator
09:32:43 <Heffalump> www.icfpcontest.org
09:33:26 <Lor> Ah, you're keeping track of the absolute direction all the time?
09:33:53 <d3z> Yes.
09:35:04 <d3z> How many food particles are there total in the sample worlds?
09:35:51 <Lor> About a thousand, iirc.
09:35:59 <Igloo> 480
09:36:15 <shaleh> historically, the real worlds were pretty different from the samples
09:36:15 <Igloo> plus up to 91*2*3 (except all the ants can't actually die)
09:36:37 <Igloo> They say they'll havethe same components
09:36:43 <Igloo> I can't remember if they said they would be random or not
09:37:12 <d3z> 480 food particles.  That means the Heffalump ants are killing a lot of my ants.  Is it intentional.
09:37:15 <shaleh> I kind of expect to see a low food map, a high food map and a maze type map or 3
09:37:37 <Lor> No. They're all like the samples.
09:38:08 <Lor> Same elements, just in different places and orientations.
09:38:24 <shaleh> Lor: thanks, I missed that part when I read it on Friday.
09:38:33 <Lor> Which is_good_, because otherwise the game would be simply about guessing the judges' mind.
09:38:39 <Lor> (Which was a problem with the 2002 contest)
09:39:14 <shaleh> lower food maps would give more to the agressive, kill em all ants.  High food could go to the gatherers.
09:39:41 <Igloo> How many of your ants died?
09:39:42 <shaleh> and they almost always have a maze or two. (-:
09:39:46 <d3z> I now wish I would have enabled the home guards on my 'wise' ants.  The Heffalump ants manage to steal all of our food.
09:39:47 <Heffalump> d3z: we don't try to attack them
09:39:51 <Igloo> We don't actively attack, but if you walk into our food store you will die
09:39:53 <Heffalump> but we do try to lure them into our base to die
09:40:47 <d3z> My wise ants won't follow a trail unless a searcher ant successfully makes it back with a particle of food.
09:41:11 <monotonom> Very wise.
09:41:49 <Lor> Wow.
09:42:49 <d3z> 'wise' vs heffalump-1: 0/20 wins, point discrepancy agv 519 favoring heffalump.
09:42:50 <shaleh> d3z: over what time frame?
09:43:06 <shaleh> i.e. do you wait forever?
09:43:06 <d3z> time frame which context, shaleh?
09:43:53 <d3z> I have two kinds of ants, searchers follow deterministic paths, and wanders are mostly random, but follow trails if they smell them.
09:44:00 <d3z> I don't know that much about our other solution.
09:44:46 <d3z> 'triple' (our solution-1) vs heffalump-1: 0/20 wins, point discrepancy agv 349.
09:45:05 <shaleh> way to go heff
09:47:19 <shaleh> how long do you usually have to wait for the ICFP panel to announce the results?
09:48:43 <Lor> Well, until ICFP.
09:48:54 <d3z> Sept 19.
09:49:14 <ludde> did you make a program to make those ants, using some genetic algorithm?
09:49:18 <d3z> They will announce number of entries and probably statistics about them before then, though.
09:49:53 <Lor> I think creationism is a wiser attitude than evolution in this contest. :)
09:50:47 <ludde> in what way is this a programming contest, though?
09:50:58 <d3z> Heffalump: how many on your team?
09:52:37 <d3z> We had to program ants, as well as whatever tools necessary to write them.  I wrote quite a bit of code (we wrote about 3100 lines of haskell, and 3 lines of perl).
09:56:20 <Lor> I think I wrote about 2000 lines of ocaml.
09:56:40 <ludde> so you wrote a language to make ants in?
09:56:52 <shaleh> you needed a simulator and an ant generator
09:56:53 <Lor> in a way. An EDSL.
09:56:58 <ludde> to get rid of those numeric labels?
09:57:00 <shaleh> most people seem to have made a compiler as well
09:57:20 <ludde> ok
09:57:51 <d3z> Mine depends on what you call a compiler :-).  I created a monad that allows a much nicer representation of the ants, and it generates the raw state-machine.
09:58:34 <d3z> It is actually fairly well commented :-)  Look at WiseAnt.hs and WiseCode.hs.
09:59:02 <Lor> Here's what my ant code looks like: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lealanko/icfp/dist/tools/ant2.ml
09:59:34 <Lor> The ant is silly, but I like the language. :)
10:00:22 <shaleh> Lor: you should run that through a ML -> HTML code prettifier
10:00:47 <ludde> cool
10:01:05 <d3z> Any suggestions for Haskell->HTML to put my code up?
10:01:14 <desrt> vim :)
10:02:30 <Lor> Well yeah, ocaml is ugly.
10:02:42 <dennisb> d3z: enscript can do it
10:04:27 <d3z> With pretty syntax highlighting.  Do you remember how to use vim to generate html?
10:13:10 <Heffalump> any more ants for us to try?
10:14:03 <shaleh> Heffalump: try the other language channels.  I bet there were a few #python contestants.
10:14:04 <Heffalump> d3z: our language looked quite similar though we didn't use >>= for sequencing and we had a scheme that meant we didn't need to use textual labels so much
10:18:25 <Lor> Heffalump, why didn't you include the direction information in the monad?
10:18:29 <d3z> Our other entry hardly used labels at all.  I started using labels because it helped me keep track of what was going on.
10:20:53 <Heffalump> lor: I didn't think about the design carefully enough
10:21:47 <shaleh> so, how many ours did you guys spend?
10:21:52 <shaleh> hours, sorry
10:22:14 <Heffalump> 4 of us working more or less continuously apart from sleep and one guy getting drunk and having rehearsals and plays and things
10:22:16 <Lor> Well, three days. Minus some sleeping.
10:22:30 <Heffalump> so I think about 150-175 man hours
10:22:31 <Bluelive> congrats to the ant builder here ;)
10:22:39 <Lor> I spent faaar too much time with the gui.
10:22:43 <Heffalump> bluelive: "Here"?
10:23:01 <Bluelive> i dunno, got a link for an ant that was posted here originaly
10:23:02 <Lor> lablgtk didn't provide _quite_ sufficient bindings, and gnomecanvas doesn't really support hundreds of thousands of items...
10:23:03 * shaleh is curious about the lightning round entries
10:23:19 <Lor> Bluelive, which one?
10:23:22 <Heffalump> bluelive: the urchin.earth.li link, or the other one?
10:23:27 <Bluelive> it does a smack down on our ant, urchin yeah
10:23:33 <Heffalump> shaleh: we'd planned to have one but didn't in the end
10:23:39 <Heffalump> bluelive: yay :-)
10:23:51 <shaleh> Heffalump: you seem to be doing well
10:23:51 <Heffalump> (that's me, Igloo, and kosmikus, plus one other)
10:24:01 <Heffalump> shaleh: it was you that said you surrounded anthills, right?
10:24:05 <Lor> A lightning round entry would have to be done pretty much by hand.
10:24:10 <Lor> It takes the first day to make all the tools.
10:24:14 <Heffalump> if done effectively that'll kill us
10:24:15 <shaleh> Heffalump: no, I didnt have an entry
10:24:15 <Bluelive> its the first one ive found that succeeded in winning
10:24:49 <Bluelive> Lor: had the vm and gui in the first 7 houres, but stared blindly at a simple bug in Sense for the next 24
10:25:28 <Heffalump> if our team could have slept up till 5pm on Friday, we could have had a lightning entry.
10:25:34 <Heffalump> (5pm being contest start time)
10:25:43 <Heffalump> at least I think we could have had one
10:25:53 <Igloo> Unfortunately half of us were at a workshop ending at 5:30pm...
10:26:03 <Igloo> Err, 3/4 in fact
10:26:05 <shaleh> Heffalump: arjanb said something about it after i made the comment about this contest leading to agressive ants
10:26:08 <Heffalump> oh yes.
10:26:44 * Heffalump would like to see that ant
10:30:51 <Bluelive> http://blue.student.utwente.nl/mutant.ant for whos intrested
10:31:02 <Heffalump> that tries to surround bases?
10:31:09 <Bluelive> nest defender, marker, slight swarming
10:31:35 <shaleh> Bluelive: earlier we were describing a nant which would surround the opponent's hive
10:31:47 <Lor> Bluelive, is that a legal program?
10:31:55 <Heffalump> it's not
10:31:57 <Bluelive> Lor, why?
10:32:02 <Heffalump> PickUp is technically the correct command
10:32:05 <Heffalump> they have "Pickup"
10:32:07 <Bluelive> did i paste the wrong one ?
10:32:11 <Lor> And it contains a reference to a non-existent state, although that state is never reached.
10:32:18 <Heffalump> I hope the judges let them get away with it, though :-)
10:32:32 <Bluelive> hmz ... found loads of ants with all lowercase commands
10:33:17 <Lor> Those are not legal, according to the spec.
10:33:39 <Amadan> "Keywords are case-insensitive" (2.8. NeuroCartography)
10:33:46 <Lor> Ah, sorry.
10:33:55 <Bluelive> Amadan: thanks for saving my life
10:33:59 <shaleh> heh
10:34:00 <Amadan> :)
10:34:01 <Heffalump> our simulator is incorrect then
10:34:02 <Heffalump> sorry :-)
10:34:20 <Lor> Mine, too. :)
10:34:24 <Bluelive> that was scary ;p
10:34:53 <Lor> Just another diversion in the spec: having BiCapitalized keywords and then subtly noting that they're case-insensitive...
10:34:56 <Heffalump> ours only really parses its own output
10:34:59 <Heffalump> Lor: yeah :-)
10:35:14 <Lor> The other one was the funky definition of the random number generator.
10:35:19 <shaleh> indeed
10:35:28 <shaleh> I bet some people got tripped up on that
10:35:40 <shaleh> I wonder if anyone just used rand()
10:35:53 <Heffalump> can't test your simulator if you do that
10:35:56 <Lor> It really only matters for testing the correctness.
10:36:16 <Heffalump> yes
10:36:21 <Bluelive> we has a working definition, but after a while decided to seed it with an external random
10:37:58 <Bluelive> 15 mins till completion, got 10 ants in a competition 10x10 over ten maps *2 rounds, may take some time
10:40:08 <d3z> We did contribute a lightning entry, and it was generated, just a little poorer than our final entry.
10:40:14 <Lor> What's the reason for the funny "Flip 1 63 9999"?
10:40:25 <d3z> goto.
10:40:39 <Heffalump> we inlined our gotos
10:41:05 <Lor> My system didn't even allow such things to be created.
10:41:19 <Heffalump> we did a fair bit of post-processing
10:41:23 <d3z> Most of mine are inlined, but had available, because it was easier to add quick debugging things.
10:41:23 <Bluelive> Gotos are nice, when starting, we optimized most out, the one at the start i was just too lazy to remove
10:41:38 <d3z> I did put a peephole optimizer in the assembler that droundy used.
10:41:58 <Lor> I can't imagine an approach that created goto states in the first place.
10:42:12 <Bluelive> not having macro/functions
10:42:52 <Bluelive> sometimes its just more clear when writing a draft version to fill it with goto's that way its more easy to add lines inbetween
10:42:58 <ludde> how many lines of code are your final ants?
10:43:08 <Lor> You mean states?
10:43:12 <ludde> yes
10:43:38 <Lor> Mine is 1451, but it could easily be optimized.
10:43:44 <ludde> ok
10:43:46 <Lor> Didn't bother, since there's ample space.
10:43:48 <Bluelive> 238 compiled 324 before
10:44:04 <Bluelive> not optimized for space, just for time
10:44:10 <d3z> And extra states don't necessarily take time.
10:44:22 <Bluelive> every instruction takes time
10:44:41 <ludde> every instruction takes 1 time unit?
10:44:45 <d3z> But if there are a lot of states just to manage different states and different types of ants, it doesn't hurt.
10:44:47 <Lor> Move takes 14.
10:44:57 <Bluelive> Lor: 15
10:44:58 <Lor> 15, sorry.
10:45:05 <ludde> ok
10:46:49 <ludde> what did you use the 6 bits of info in each cell as?
10:46:54 <d3z> heffalump - I noticed that the state in your simulator is strict.  I tried this on ours, and it got slower.  Turns out that there is a bunch of stuff that doesn't get computed.
10:47:41 <Bluelive> first 4 bits for a stripe pattern that points back to the nest filling the whole field
10:47:57 <Bluelive> last 2 bits as a three state marker for a food return path
10:48:01 <Heffalump> we were lazy to begin with and had space leaks
10:48:02 <ludde> stripe pattern?
10:48:49 <Heffalump> so did noone else think of the "keeper" structure to protect food?
10:48:55 <Bluelive> ludde: yup, say your on a cell marked with 2, then you need to look for a cell marker with 1 and go to it, repeat and your back on the nest
10:49:02 <Heffalump> ludde: 3 bits for home pointers, 3 bits for food pointers
10:49:28 <ludde> Bluelive: if you have 4 bits for that then you can just store 16 steps?
10:49:32 <Bluelive> Heffalump: my ant stays on its food unless its sees three of its kind, of which atleast one is carrying food, and no enemy to be seen
10:50:18 <Heffalump> right
10:50:19 <Bluelive> ludde: a cell only has one of the markers set, so there are only 4 states (yeah i know, i was to lazy to use a binary encoding) after a 0 look for a three
10:50:34 <ludde> ah ok
10:50:51 <Lor> Bluelive, what happens if paths cross?
10:50:51 <Heffalump> we used pretty much every possible encoding for things
10:50:57 <Bluelive> loads of optimalisations now that i think abit more about it
10:51:08 <Bluelive> Lor, they never do by the way they are drawn
10:51:47 <Lor> How would you folks compare the proportion of time that the tools took compared to actually designing the ants?
10:51:49 <Igloo> The only thing that we didn't have a meaning for was all set
10:52:19 <ludde> so you basically made a lot of random ants and competed them against each other?
10:52:38 <Heffalump> we didn't have time to make lots of ants
10:52:43 <Bluelive> i really missed a better compile that would allow me to fake function or even a stack
10:52:50 <Heffalump> we spent maybe 40 man hours out of 160 or so on the tools
10:52:53 <ludde> ok
10:52:54 <Bluelive> there was enough instruction space to encode it
10:53:11 <Lor> Heffalump, figures. I had 50 hours total. :)
10:56:27 <Bluelive> hmz, nice first results of the world run
10:56:34 <Bluelive> lets drop the slowest first
10:56:55 <Bluelive> ASM-155 lost 400 rounds won none
10:57:19 <Bluelive> rhino lost alot so did thomas and ringfort
10:58:29 <d3z> Are my ants in this contest?
10:58:37 <Bluelive> what are they called ?
10:58:52 <d3z> umm, solution-1.ant, and solution-2.ant :-)
10:59:24 <d3z> we called them triple.ant and wise.ant.
10:59:45 <Bluelive> dunno, i picked about 20 from the websites and mailing list
10:59:54 <Heffalump> do you have ours?
10:59:59 <Bluelive> i dunno
11:00:12 <Bluelive> i have urchin[1,2].ant if that is waht you mean
11:00:18 <Heffalump> that'll be us, I guess
11:00:28 <Bluelive> who would be redteam ?
11:01:32 <Heffalump> which ants are doing well?
11:01:44 <d3z> I just put our ants on our website http://www.davidb.org/icfp04
11:02:05 <Bluelive> urchin and redteam are first and second now, mine is third currently
11:03:05 <Heffalump> do you have a URL for redteam?
11:05:40 <Bluelive> ive but tiple and wise into my contest
11:05:56 <Bluelive> Heffalump: nope i just name them to the team name or url, dunno who made them
11:06:00 <Heffalump> when you say "first", which ant do you mean?
11:06:25 <Bluelive> urchin2 shows the best result currently
11:09:43 <Heffalump> interesting
11:09:51 <Heffalump> that one avoids stealing food from the enemy base
11:10:15 <Bluelive> hmz ?
11:10:16 <Bluelive> why
11:10:33 <Heffalump> to avoid getting itself killed by a strategy like ours which leaves bait
11:10:37 <Bluelive> ugh bad input file stops the run, drunksed1 seems to be the offender
11:10:55 <Bluelive> guess thats why you kick our ass
11:11:03 <d3z> Wasn't druksed from last year?
11:11:05 <Bluelive> we try to camp the enemys food
11:11:13 <Heffalump> I think we kick your ass because we are good at finding food, actually.
11:11:21 <Heffalump> You did get a few killed randomly, not by our bait strategy.
11:11:44 <Heffalump> our bait strategy is designed to trick our own bot into leaving a trail saying "look, loads of food over here"
11:11:50 <Bluelive> ugh : for comments instead of ;
11:11:53 <Heffalump> the actual food is on a surrounded square that will kill them
11:11:55 <d3z> urchin is amazing at finding food.  For one of my ants, it takes every particle of food, plus kills 15 ants (and collects food).
11:12:16 <Heffalump> I thought the strategy we used was the completely obvious one.
11:12:21 <Heffalump> Obviously others didn't :-)
11:12:42 <Bluelive> righty thats it, validator off
11:12:51 <Bluelive> lets see if we can parse it anyways
11:12:56 <Heffalump> playing against ants that just sit there, we collect all the food in less than 30000 states
11:13:01 <Heffalump> s/states/steps/
11:13:27 <Bluelive> we have all free food in about 40k moves, then start feeding of the enmies nest
11:14:18 <Bluelive> and somebody with a bad brainpointer
11:14:30 <Bluelive> what would happen if you invoke an illegal address in the brain ?
11:14:33 <Heffalump> you have no real hope of feeding from our nest
11:14:37 <Bluelive> the game is forfitted ?
11:14:41 <Heffalump> I imagine so.
11:14:46 <Heffalump> or maybe the ant dies
11:15:49 <Lor> Is it even legal for the brain to contain a reference to an illegal address?
11:16:12 <Bluelive> i hope so in the Flip 1 case
11:16:24 <Heffalump> http://tomas.rokicki.com/icfp2004/ has a very good ant
11:16:24 <Bluelive> formix seems bugged
11:16:34 <Lor> I just started working on ar arrow combinator library for programming ants.
11:16:48 <Bluelive> Heffalump: yes read team, they rank second currently
11:17:40 <Bluelive> can somebody validate that formix is broken ?
11:17:40 <Heffalump> umm, their ant is *much* better than ours
11:17:44 <Heffalump> yes, it is broken.
11:18:40 <Heffalump> hmm, maybe not (re the redteam ant)
11:18:48 <Lor> They have a reasonable language.
11:19:01 <Lor> For defining ants, that is. Not for the implementation! :)
11:19:02 <Heffalump> our language is a bit of a mess :-)
11:19:23 <Bluelive> about 45 minutes till i have had all ants against all others on map 1
11:19:50 <d3z> Bluelive - do you have a URL for these?
11:20:02 <Lor> Bluelive, here's mine: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lealanko/icfp/dist/solution-1.ant
11:20:40 <Lor> It's a silly toy, but I'd be interested in seeing if it's really the _worst_ of the lot or only the second worst. :)
11:21:00 <Bluelive> hmz
11:21:23 <Bluelive> a ; directly next to a valid instruction, would that be considered valid ?
11:22:27 * Heffalump realises why urchin2 is on top
11:22:34 <Heffalump> it doesn't fall into redteam's trap
11:23:24 * Bluelive updates his ant brain parser for spieleck's strange comment syntax
11:24:10 <Bluelive> what is redteams trap ?
11:24:55 <Heffalump> have you seen our keeper structure?
11:25:09 <Bluelive> nope
11:25:16 * Smerdyakov follows a link from Tomas Rokicki's web site to his company's site and finds they have misspelled "enterprise." :D
11:25:18 <Heffalump> ok, surround a hex with 5 ants
11:25:33 <Heffalump> have a food dump in the 6th surrounding hex
11:25:47 <Heffalump> if someone moves onto the food dump, use signals to move the entire set of ants forward to kill the ant on the food hex
11:25:58 <Bluelive> wow, sweet
11:25:59 <Heffalump> free food, delivered straight to your food dump...
11:26:21 <d3z> That's pretty ingenious, our signals are more static, and I ended up with race conditions in them anyway.
11:26:29 <Heffalump> luckily urchin2 is designed to completely avoid the enemy base
11:26:32 <Heffalump> that's probably why it's on top
11:26:35 <Bluelive> i did add a bit of code not to get near enemies when random walking, but not when following a food trail
11:26:54 <Bluelive> why do you avoid the enemies base ? its the richest food source
11:27:16 <shaleh> easiest way to die as well
11:27:45 <Heffalump> it's only a good food source against people with no defensive strategy
11:27:58 <Heffalump> we have a very good defensive strategy, at least for protecting our food, and we are expecting others to as well
11:28:10 <Heffalump> and against the people that don't protect their food our gathering probably wins too
11:28:36 <Bluelive> We protect our food well, and kill early random walkers by swarming them, but not against something like redteams
11:28:46 <Heffalump> redteam surrounds the enemy base too
11:29:05 <Bluelive> you have my ant ?
11:29:17 <Heffalump> errm, not sure
11:29:22 <Bluelive> mutAnt
11:29:26 <Heffalump> URL?
11:29:45 <Bluelive> http://blue.student.utwente.nl/mutant.ant
11:30:07 <Heffalump> I think we have tried it, yes
11:30:13 <Bluelive> its bad against yours, good against most others except redteams
11:30:37 <Bluelive> i would expect redteam to be in the first 10
11:30:41 <Heffalump> easily
11:30:57 <Heffalump> haven't that lot won or come close to winning before?
11:32:05 <Heffalump> he came 2nd in 2002
11:32:21 <Heffalump> and 2003 apparently
11:32:36 <Bluelive> this is my first year in this, ill see about next year
11:33:02 <Bluelive> if i would do it agian i would focus on a better compiler, and even more validation
11:33:43 <Bluelive> what good is a full simulation in 1,5 seconds, its too slow for genetic work, and without gui its not helpfull when examining your code
11:33:44 <Heffalump> our compiler never produced invalid output, which helped
11:33:57 <Heffalump> our simulation was shockingly slow
11:34:08 <Bluelive> our compiler was just a macro replace it never validated commands it didnt need to rewrite
11:34:20 <Bluelive> slow ?
11:34:32 <Heffalump> it takes about 3 minutes just to get the scores for a single run
11:34:43 <Heffalump> 6 minutes if you want to produce output the visualizer can use
11:34:51 <Bluelive> wow
11:34:58 <Bluelive> but we dont make a fump
11:35:02 <Bluelive> saves on io
11:35:10 <Heffalump> a what?
11:35:20 <Heffalump> ah, dump
11:36:12 <Bluelive> can somebody validate that  z25-7-11 is broken ?
11:36:34 <Bluelive> it seems to miss an argument on either pickup or Move
11:38:47 <Lor> Redteam's hive's initial organization is pretty impressive.
11:39:07 <Bluelive> hmz ? what do they do 
11:39:15 <Heffalump> the thing I described above
11:39:20 <Heffalump> they do that on each corner of their hive
11:39:22 <Bluelive> i really feel stupid for not adding direction to the ui 
11:39:35 <Heffalump> their weakness is that they don't do a good job of collecting food, and that they spend a *lot* of ants on those structures
11:44:08 <Bluelive> hmz, this run i win against redteam1
11:45:27 <Bluelive> i wonder how they got those to organize on the nest
11:45:45 <Bluelive> they also semm to try to swamp my nest
11:48:05 <Bluelive> great thing :)
11:49:13 <Bluelive> for some readon they dont close the line around my nest
11:49:56 <Lor> They just don't have enough ants both to attack _and_ trap _and_ gather.
11:50:19 <Bluelive> nice food for me those trappers, they get killed pretty fast
11:51:03 <Bluelive> we both allready have almost no random food finders n round 40k
11:51:47 <Lor> This must be the coolest corewars variant I've ever seen.
11:52:02 <Bluelive> hmz i seem to be trapping my own subjects in the nest
11:52:25 <Bluelive> they should start gathering but cant get a spot as guard because of the trappers :(
11:52:55 <Bluelive> problem with their eaters on the nest is that no trails back to the enemies nest are created
11:54:49 <Lor> Hm, the surrounders don't understand to stop when the enemy hive is completely surrounded.
11:58:29 <Bluelive> what i dont get is how they know to standstill
11:59:00 <Bluelive> marker 0 they seem to use for it
11:59:49 <Bluelive> hmz i win this one
11:59:59 <Bluelive> killed 25 of his
12:00:04 <Bluelive> 35 even
12:01:25 <Heffalump> I think they use a marker to indicate one corner of the base, and do dead reckoning to figure out where to go next.
12:01:47 <Bluelive> great design
12:02:10 <Lor> Wonder why they surround the base from the outside instead of forming a ring inside it. Would take less ants.
12:02:22 <Bluelive> but i think if they would use my method of food gathering with their base protecting it would be an even better ant
12:02:32 <Lor> Hm. Maybe they guess that there are some static ants inside.
12:02:37 <Heffalump> Bluelive: what is your method of food gathering?
12:02:59 <Bluelive> Lor: ithink as a protection against their own defense type,
12:03:22 <Heffalump> yes, almost certainly
12:04:17 <Bluelive> Heffalump: make a road back from the base with a pattern that can be followe to or from the base, and use a two bit binary number for food paths, if you carry food make it three, if you follow it dec one, following is limited to not the direction back to the nest
12:04:47 <Heffalump> I don't entirely understand that. Whose ant is better at gathering food, ours or yours?
12:05:00 <Bluelive> road back to nest cover the whole map after 20k roads sometimes
12:05:05 <Bluelive> Heffalump: dunno
12:05:59 <Bluelive> yur food walkers seem more effective
12:06:05 <Bluelive> how do they know the direction ?
12:06:12 <Heffalump> our markers encode it
12:06:23 <Heffalump> they always maintain their own heading in their own internal state
12:06:25 <Bluelive> ah you dont use a pattern only a direction
12:06:36 <Bluelive> mine dont know what way is up
12:06:37 <Heffalump> we have two directions marked; path home and path to food
12:06:51 <Bluelive> i think yours are the better gatherers
12:06:55 <Lor> That's a good use of the state space.
12:07:08 <Lor> So you end up with 1600 states per direction, which still ought to be enough.
12:07:20 <Bluelive> it would replicate too much code to be usefull in my case, never would be able to debug 6 copies correctly
12:07:25 <Heffalump> our ant is only 4000 states anyway
12:07:41 <Heffalump> we could have used the monad more effectively to keep track of it
12:07:52 <Heffalump> but it wasn't too bad, programming with (Int -> Fragment)
12:08:04 <Bluelive> they dont seem to find food very effectivly if its off their main roads
12:08:25 <Heffalump> ours?
12:08:33 <Heffalump> we don't really have main roads, but we do end up with dead areas
12:08:47 <Heffalump> IM areas we don't tend to visit because they are shadowed by rocks
12:08:57 <Bluelive> looked like about 20 ants came back for the food but walked just by it and went off into nowhere
12:08:58 <d3z> My ant has 6 copies of it, but the source only has one.  My compiler monad even checks that the ants never get confused by their direction.
12:09:05 <Heffalump> yes, that was a mistake on our part
12:09:16 <Heffalump> we should have made our ants look to the side for food
12:09:28 <Heffalump> d3z: the checking about confusion is what we should have done
12:09:38 <Bluelive> really wish i made my compiler advanced enough for that
12:09:40 <Heffalump> one thing our language does do well is avoid using string labels for identity very often
12:09:54 <Bluelive> had a few ideas to encode variables be replication, but never got it working
12:10:39 <Bluelive> love your nest protection btw
12:10:42 <Bluelive> how does it work ?
12:10:47 <Heffalump> "work"?
12:10:58 <Heffalump> in the static form, all the ants sitting there are invulnerable
12:11:03 <Bluelive> they enter from the bottom, and the one in the corner guess off
12:11:12 <Heffalump> we lay paths telling returning ants to go into it and drop food
12:11:32 <Heffalump> the one pointing at the drop point sees this, turns round and buggers off, timing it so that the ant dropping food can move into place and replace it immediately
12:12:00 <Bluelive> much better then what we do
12:12:06 <d3z> I got too caught up trying to mark paths and not direction.
12:12:12 <Bluelive> we use the whole side of the homebase
12:12:31 <Bluelive> how does it decide which corner to take ?
12:12:49 <Heffalump> we chose that corner because the ant in the top-left corner has the lowest ID
12:12:52 <Heffalump> makes the timing simplest
12:13:10 <Bluelive> but the ant doesnt know its id
12:13:20 <Bluelive> a
12:13:21 <Heffalump> it does know it's the lowest at the start of the game
12:13:24 <Lor> The corner is easy to detect.
12:13:26 <Igloo> turn left; turn left; look left; look right
12:13:26 <Bluelive> but it can see its the topleft most
12:13:30 <Heffalump> because the specification says they are numbered from the topleft
12:13:31 <Igloo> Only ant 1 has found both clear
12:14:02 <Bluelive> ugh, wihs i had a better compiler once again :)
12:14:07 <Bluelive> wish
12:14:14 <Bluelive> great ids
12:14:14 <Heffalump> that bit Igloo wrote by hand, essentially
12:14:28 <Heffalump> well, in our language, but he could have done it entirely by hand if he'd needed to
12:14:50 <Bluelive> at50K all food is gone
12:15:05 <Bluelive> your ahead, my ants can now only wander into your trap
12:15:24 <Heffalump> did our bait work?
12:15:30 <Bluelive> no
12:15:38 <Heffalump> pity :-) (that was really an after-thought)
12:15:48 <Bluelive> mostrandom walkers check for an enemy, not all though
12:15:57 <Bluelive> about 4 have been eaten at state 60k
12:16:16 <Bluelive> its too obviously a trap
12:16:33 <Bluelive> combine it with the redteams and it would be insanely cool
12:16:36 <Heffalump> yes
12:16:46 <Igloo> It's not really a trap at all
12:16:47 <Heffalump> if we'd had more time (usual cry :-) we could have done some really neat stuff
12:16:49 <Igloo> It's a safety device
12:16:53 <Igloo> It just happens to work as a trap
12:17:04 <Heffalump> the point is you have no hope of stealing our food
12:17:09 <Heffalump> short of exploiting one subtle race condition
12:17:12 <Bluelive> wish a thought of it
12:17:19 <Igloo> If it was a trap it would have faced outwards (one of the things we've realised we should have added)
12:17:41 <Igloo> That's one reason a team is useful
12:17:46 <Igloo> More people having ideas
12:17:58 <Bluelive> i worked alone on the ants
12:18:13 <Igloo> Adn the inital idea wasn't as good as that, e.g. it faced right and the exit strategy wasn't part of it (until we realised the problem would exist)
12:18:20 <Bluelive> and most vmbugs come from the guy that left after the lightning round
12:18:31 <Igloo> Oh, I thought you were alone for some reason
12:18:53 <Heffalump> vmbugs?
12:19:09 <Igloo> We were somewhat hampered by slow tools too. Not sure if it is a Haskell implementation issue or our lack of knowledge thereof though
12:19:17 <Bluelive> this.direction and direction were too different variables of the same type, try and find that one
12:19:29 <Bluelive> Next time join forces ?
12:19:40 <Bluelive> my strong point is the fast vm with strong validation
12:19:47 <Lor> "validation"?
12:20:04 <Bluelive> i try to check everything when in setup
12:20:34 <Bluelive> kinda to protect myself from a hackish nature
12:20:45 <Lor> What language did you use?
12:20:48 <Bluelive> java
12:20:55 <Bluelive> i wanted to use Pluk, but it was too slow
12:24:08 <Bluelive> thats what you get for not having base datatypes built in, 10 method calls to add two ints together and such :)
12:25:50 <Bluelive> hmz might be another houre before i even have only map 1 done for all ants permutated that i have here
12:27:15 <Bluelive> 29 ants in the queue
12:27:39 <d3z> My haskell sim took about 20 seconds for one 100,000 run.
12:27:55 <Heffalump> bah :-)
12:28:00 <Bluelive> this is about 29^2*10 simulations ;p
12:28:01 <Heffalump> we could have done much better with a sim that good
12:28:32 <Bluelive> you can try mine, it does 0 to 100,000 in 1.5 seconds, no gui though in that mode
12:29:00 <d3z> I considered writing one in an imperitive language, I considered ocaml.
12:31:41 <Lor> I wrote one in ocaml.
12:31:52 <Lor> It was fast enough, but I didn't really use it for any massive timings.
12:32:38 <Bluelive> if i could have gotten it 100 times faster i might have tried some random change and compare engine, on the Flips probabilities or something
12:33:24 <d3z> The profiling I ran showed my sim spent much of its time looking for ants that should die.
12:34:09 <Bluelive> so did mine earlier
12:34:28 <Bluelive> optimizing the lookup of surrounding cells reduced that alot
12:34:50 <Lor> Yep, that does lots of duplicate work.
12:35:40 <Bluelive> and looking at the first two to see if they contain an enemy and if they dont dont look any further also did alot of magic
12:36:55 <Riastradh> Bluelive, did your simulator do it in 1.5 seconds with or without dumps?
12:37:09 <Bluelive> without, i never did implement dumps
12:37:34 <Riastradh> My simulator, on a crufty old SPARC box, did it in 40 seconds with overly verbose dumps.
12:37:48 * d3z is away: I'm busy
12:44:28 <Bluelive> 589 matches done
12:44:46 <Bluelive> 25 to go
12:44:49 <Bluelive> 250
12:45:00 <Heffalump> someone write a decompiler!
12:45:42 <Bluelive> decompile to what ?
12:46:13 <Bluelive> resolve all ids to the next line to a 'next' label, all things pointing to the same place to a label
12:46:24 <Bluelive> that would be a great start
12:46:24 <Lor> A graph browser would be nice.
12:48:55 <Lor> I do wish I had had a machine that could have displayed this kind of thing for 100x100: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lealanko/icfp/ss.png
12:49:21 <Heffalump> that's roughly what our visualizer does
12:49:47 <Lor> I bet it wasn't antialiased. :)
12:49:56 <Bluelive> ooh nice
12:50:16 <Bluelive> wou could do that ofcourse, with a zoom window showing a selected 10x10 area of the field
12:50:55 <Lor> Well yeah. :P
12:51:11 <Heffalump> no, it wasn't, but I think our ant is better than yours, and I know which I prefer :-)
12:52:55 <Lor> :)
12:53:38 <Lor> I really can't leave this ant thing now that the contest is over. I've spent so much effort on this already that I must get something out of it.
12:53:59 <Bluelive> just a bit more patience
12:54:19 <Heffalump> redteam have some _very_ cool strategies
12:54:24 <Bluelive> it needs only 30 mins or so more till i have permutated all ants on sample0.world
12:54:39 <Lor> heffa, other than the traps and surrounding?
12:55:37 <Bluelive> the surrounding isnt that intresting
12:55:47 <Lor> Well, it's pretty effective.
12:56:00 <Lor> Or would be, if it weren't so late and prevented them from gathering efficiently.
12:56:01 <Bluelive> true
12:56:17 <Bluelive> if only we could continue building now that weve seen the enemie ;)
12:56:24 <Lor> We can. Of course.
12:56:33 <Lor> That's what I said, I can't leave this at this.
12:56:36 <Bluelive> no not really, would take too much time
12:56:50 <Bluelive> guess we could do a bit more next weekend
12:57:01 <Bluelive> guess the GF will protest though
12:57:01 <Lor> Hey, some people play online rpgs all the time, how is designing ants worse? :)
12:57:14 <Bluelive> its so abstract ;p
12:58:23 <Bluelive> 700 matches simulated
12:59:14 <Heffalump> lor: well, those are pretty cool :-)
13:03:18 <Heffalump> I really like the jaws they leave outside our anthill in their second version
13:03:46 <Bluelive> hmz
13:04:00 <Bluelive> building a seed trap around the enemy hill would also be great
13:04:15 <Bluelive> let every nth ant get away to leave behind a trail to lure in more ants
13:05:51 <Heffalump> yes
13:05:57 <Heffalump> we will be badly beaten by something that uses bait
13:06:14 <Bluelive> same here
13:10:07 <Bluelive> uch that celeron is alot sloweer then this one
13:10:11 <Bluelive> 800 matches
13:10:34 <Heffalump> will you put a table online?
13:11:21 <Bluelive> finally
13:11:25 <Bluelive> got some output
13:13:56 <Bluelive> http://blue.student.utwente.nl/?txt/world0score
13:14:05 <Bluelive> its unsorted
13:14:17 <Bluelive> urchin2 highest scored
13:14:41 <Bluelive> urchin1 second
13:15:06 <Heffalump> ;-D
13:15:26 <Heffalump> try facing off the 5 best ants against each other or something
13:15:26 <Bluelive> redteam1 thrird, redteam2 fourth, marker11 (mine) fifth
13:15:34 <Bluelive> nice to know im still in the top 5
13:16:19 <Heffalump> we are very effective at thrashing not very intelligent ants, but not so effective against clever ones like redteam*
13:16:32 <Heffalump> (or yours, but I don't think yours attacks us so much)
13:16:44 <Bluelive> allright, ive put the top 5 against eachother
13:16:51 <Bluelive> should take 200 simulations
13:17:12 <Heffalump> I think you'll see urchin2,redteam2,redteam1,urchin1,marker11 or similar.
13:17:20 <Heffalump> but that's just a guess
13:17:45 * Heffalump cycles home, back in 20 mins
13:17:58 <shaleh> did readteam release code, or just the ant?
13:18:32 <Bluelive> how will they score teams with a 1 and 2 entry ?
13:18:49 <Bluelive> only count the best scoring one ?
13:18:56 <shaleh> isn't each entry judged on its own merits?
13:21:28 <Bluelive> that way you could score both first and second position by entering you code twice and hope it guess to first place
13:21:56 <Lor> shaleh, the code is there too, in docs/
13:22:14 <shaleh> Lor: I do not have the URL for redteam.
13:22:36 <Bluelive> urchin2 urchin1 redteam2 redteam1 marker11
13:22:40 <shaleh> Bluelive: as I understand it, the .ant is the competition.  The code you used will be used in deciding ties and the like
13:22:43 <Lor> http://tomas.rokicki.com/icfp2004/
13:23:18 <shaleh> Lor: thanks
13:23:23 <Bluelive> shaleh: no i mean what does the optional solution2.ant score for
13:26:17 <shaleh> Bluelive: from what I remember when I read the rules, each any is scored.  So this basically lets each team submit two different ants.  Say one aggressive ant and one protector ant.
13:26:48 <Bluelive> yeah okay, but only the one with the highest score is listed in the final list ?
13:27:20 <shaleh> in theory redteam 1 and 2 could be 1st and 2nd place.
13:27:29 <shaleh> but I doubt they would allow it to happen.
13:28:22 <Bluelive> too bad there is no third price
13:29:24 <Bluelive> looks like urchin is gooing to be worth 1000e
13:29:41 <sm> hey all.. help, I can't google the ICFP 2004 home page.. :/
13:30:23 <sm> ok
13:30:29 <sm> phew.. :) 2004 helped
13:30:42 <shaleh> it was surprisingly hard to google
13:30:43 <sm> back to our regular programming
13:31:18 <Lor> Now that there are no longer any time limits, it might be interesting to try to grow ants genetically.
13:33:14 <shaleh> Bluelive: that is only the entries we know about, and on maps we know about.
13:33:51 <Bluelive> shaleh: true
13:34:06 <Bluelive> but its obvious that ive not won :(
13:39:07 <phubuh> hey hey
13:39:21 <phubuh> at about what time of day will you guys be at EuroHaskell on the 10th?
13:42:48 * shaleh looks over the RedTeam output.
13:42:56 <shaleh> perl, java, m4 and C++
13:42:59 <shaleh> oh my
13:43:08 <phubuh> a glorious combination indeed
13:43:14 <SyntaxNinja> what's m4?
13:43:18 <Igloo> preprocessor
13:43:26 <SyntaxNinja> that's how I was planning to implement Cabal actually. 
13:43:26 <shaleh> the langauge  autoconf, sendmail and others use
13:43:34 <SyntaxNinja> ahh
13:44:12 <shaleh> Bluelive: have you considered using the RedTeam sim to compare the results to your own?
13:44:18 <SyntaxNinja> btw, speaking of EuroHaskell, my plan is to create a bunch of test cases for Cabal that fail, and EuroHaskell folks can work on making them succeed :)
13:44:32 <phubuh> ooh ooh!
13:44:42 <shaleh> Cabal?
13:44:51 <Bluelive> shaleh: why dont you try it ?
13:44:58 <SyntaxNinja> http://www.haskell.org/libraryInfrastructure/
13:44:58 <shaleh> Bluelive: no java (-:
13:47:51 <shaleh> Bluelive: I asked because everyone was talking about their simulators.
13:48:00 <shaleh> Bluelive: thought maybe you would like to compare outputs.
13:48:08 <shaleh> curiousity more than anything else.
13:48:11 <Bluelive> i doubt it would be comparable
13:48:26 <Bluelive> would poeple frown on me publishing results ?
13:48:35 <Bluelive> they arent official and such
13:53:04 * d3z is back (gone 01:15:15)
13:53:38 <d3z> I'd at least be curious how our ranked.  I got kind of disappointed, since urchin was the first one I ran it against.
13:54:08 <d3z> So, at least maybe an actual functional lauguage might win the ICFP contest.  Been a while.
13:54:37 <shaleh> unless redteam gets him
13:56:45 <Bluelive> redteam gets second after urchin
13:56:55 <Heffalump> I like that ordering :-)
13:56:58 <Bluelive> atleast, as far as i know
13:57:02 <Igloo> It depends on what other ants there are
13:57:05 <Bluelive> i dont, means im third
13:57:10 <Bluelive> atleast for the bots we know about
13:57:14 <shaleh> Igloo: indeed.
13:57:33 <shaleh> I am still curious to see what kind of a curveball they give you guys with the maps
13:57:45 <Igloo> Did it say it was random?
13:57:50 <Heffalump> I thought they promised to generate random ones.
13:58:18 <Lor> Not that they will differ in any profound way.
13:58:20 <shaleh> yes, but how evil is the generator (-:
13:58:27 <Igloo> I can't see that under "3.2 Judging"
13:58:53 <Lor> 3.1
13:59:11 <Heffalump> gah, someone has emailed me personally from a gmail account (about our entry). Do I abandon my principles and reply? :-)
13:59:19 <Bluelive> http://blue.student.utwente.nl/?txt/world0score
13:59:23 <Bluelive> sorted to score
13:59:37 * Igloo wonders who
13:59:41 <shaleh> Heffalump: one of the redteam guys lists his gmail account
13:59:57 <Heffalump> the person who just posted to the list too
14:00:01 <Igloo> Bluelive: Can you explain the numbers?
14:00:10 <Heffalump> Carlos Scheidegger <carlos.scheidegger@gmail.com>
14:00:17 <Bluelive> what do you need to know about them ?
14:00:21 <Bluelive> they are cummulative
14:00:37 <Bluelive> score is defined by the contestdescription
14:00:54 <Bluelive> this is the result of playing these 29 bots against eachother on world0
14:01:18 <Igloo> I don't understand the labelled numbers
14:01:39 <Bluelive> the description of the labels are at the top
14:01:55 <Igloo> RH and BH always seem to be 5096, but I can't think what that would be
14:02:02 <Igloo> Yes, but I don't understand them  :-)
14:02:16 <Bluelive> total count of all homecells over all simulations played by the ant
14:02:55 <Bluelive> the color of the ant is considered red (score if the ant played black is still added to red)
14:02:56 <Igloo> Ah, so 91*28*2
14:03:28 <Bluelive> yes
14:04:15 <Bluelive> urchin2 wins on points but urchin1 wins on food for example
14:04:37 <Bluelive> and redteam is the biggest killer
14:04:54 <Heffalump> urchin1 and 2 differ only in their treatment of the enemy base
14:05:12 <Heffalump> urchin1 ignores its existence, urchin2 refuses to walk over it when looking for food (so in practice never visits it at all)
14:05:45 <Bluelive> i wish i had your ant to fight against during development ;(
14:06:22 * d3z is away: I'm busy
14:06:43 <Heffalump> well, if we'd had redteam to fight we'd have done much better :-)
14:20:14 * Jerub applies for job.
14:20:56 <Heffalump> anywhere exciting?
14:26:54 <Jerub> Heffalump: biotech startup.
14:53:43 * Heffalump thinks about the ideal Haskell combinator library
14:54:06 <Heffalump> (for the contest)
14:54:12 <Jerub> when is the contest?
14:54:16 <Jerub> I want to enter that.
14:54:19 <shaleh> last weekend
14:54:21 <Heffalump> the ICFP contest?
14:54:23 <shaleh> you just missed it (-:
14:54:29 <Jerub> crap.
14:54:52 <Jerub> c'est la vie.
14:54:58 <shaleh> Jerub: nothing stopping you from making your own entry to compare to others though
14:55:05 <shaleh> and the plus side -- you get to sleep
14:55:09 <Lukhas> hehe
14:55:47 <Heffalump> I'm trying to resist the temptation to spend time on first making a beautiful combinator library, rewriting our entry in that and then improving it to be unbeatable :-)
14:56:18 <shaleh> Heffalump: why the need for the combinator lib?
14:56:47 <Heffalump> because programming in the existing one isn't too pleasant
15:04:32 <Lor> Boyohboyohboy, are arrows cool or what?
15:04:48 <Philippa> heh
15:05:03 <Lor> Is there really no shorthand syntax for "arr -< ()" ? I use that a lot.
15:05:15 <Lor> (Since none of the primitive arrow operators take any input)
15:07:20 <Heffalump> umm, I don't think so
15:07:48 <Heffalump> it's nice that ghc has native arrows support now
15:07:56 <Heffalump> are you writing an arrows library for the ants?
15:08:08 <Lor> That's really strange. It's like not supporting do { a; b; c } notation
15:08:08 <Lor> Yep.
15:08:20 <Lor> Then I can construct really abstract control operators.
15:08:55 <Lor> I really wished I had some when I tried to devise an ant, but I didn't have time to figure out anything very sophisticated.
15:09:15 <Heffalump> I first wrote a monad library then realised that gathering the combinators needed a static part
15:09:31 <Heffalump> s/combinators/fragments/
15:09:42 <Lor> Yep, that's why it has to be arrows, not monads.
15:09:44 <Heffalump> but I didn't have time to redo it so we stuck with that and gathered them manually
15:10:00 <Heffalump> do you have a plan for doing state?
15:10:58 <Lor> You mean state variables?
15:11:02 <Heffalump> yes
15:11:15 <Lor> I have a hunch that it will come naturally when the time is ripe. :)
15:11:18 <Heffalump> I was wondering about quickCheck style tricks with type classes
15:13:54 <Lor> Is it better style to have non-inputting arrows have type Arr a b or Arr () b?
15:14:07 <Lor> The () is more precise, but seems to be often inconvenient.
15:14:20 <Heffalump> errm, not sure; what will the b be?
15:14:42 <Lor> Well, depend, but the point is that it won't use any input.
15:15:32 <Heffalump> errm, are you sure?
15:15:44 <Heffalump> that there won't be any need for intermediate combinators that do use input?
15:15:51 <Heffalump> or that it won't be the right way to do state
15:16:01 <Lor> That's what "first" is for.
15:19:06 <bringert> phubuh: not sure when to meet
15:19:18 <bringert> 09.00 sound good?
15:21:23 <phubuh> bringert: sure
15:23:12 <bringert> just follow the arrows
15:23:16 <bringert> >>>
15:23:23 <phubuh> :-)
15:23:33 <Heffalump> surely they should lead to John Hughes' office? :-)
15:23:46 <bringert> it's pretty close
15:24:14 <bringert> I'll go to his office tomorrow and try to convince him to drop by eurohaskell
15:24:44 <bringert> hmm, he's probably not there though, said he wouldn't be
15:24:51 <Lor> Is there a way to make ghci show all the instances of a class (or of a type) like hugs does?

15:42:33 <Heffalump> anyway, you should spin dizzily with pride, since I haven't yet seen an ant that can beat ours (I fully expect there to have been such ones submitted, though)
15:43:42 <shaleh> indeed, even redteam succumbs
15:44:16 <Heffalump> I still don't understand why noone else implemented our food collection strategy.
15:44:36 <Heffalump> (noone else we've seen yet)
15:45:39 <andersca> hello
15:47:00 <Lor> godbloodydammit, it works.
15:47:12 <shaleh> ur?
15:47:19 <kosmikus> Heffalump: yeah, good flight
15:47:29 <Lor> If I just could get rid of those "-< ()":s everywhere, all would be nice.
15:47:31 <kosmikus> nice to hear that we haven't done really badly ...
15:47:52 <Lor> Next I need to figure out how to do jumps.
15:47:54 <shaleh> kinda lame you guys have to wait until September for the results
15:49:39 <Lor> Heffalump, what again was your food collection strategy in a nutshell?
15:50:02 <Heffalump> search randomly, leaving direction markers indicating the path home
15:50:14 <Heffalump> when you find food, walk home along those markers, leaving food markers pointing the othe rway
15:50:27 <Heffalump> searching ants coming across those food markers follow them
15:50:46 <Heffalump> there's some somewhat clever collision avoidance too
15:50:58 <Lor> That seems like the natural way of doing it. But it isn't common?
15:51:16 <Heffalump> nothing we've seen so far does it; we kick everyone else's arses at food collection.
15:51:24 <kosmikus> what do the others do?
15:51:27 <arjanb> direction markers are not obvious
15:51:32 <Lor> I think it's your markers that really make the difference.
15:51:35 <kosmikus> I haven't yet had time to look at any other entries ...
15:51:46 <Heffalump> noone else seems to have markers that do what ours do
15:52:13 <Lor> Actually, the _really_ ingenious bit is just keeping the absolute direction in the state all the time.
15:52:15 <kosmikus> what do they use markers for, then?
15:52:23 <Heffalump> lor: I'm sure lots of people must be doing that.
15:52:34 <Heffalump> though to be fair I sort of assumed everyone would do roughly what we do
15:52:41 <Heffalump> both with absolute direction and state
15:52:43 <Lor> Well, to me the absolute direction didn't seem at all a very relevant piece of information.
15:52:50 <Lor> Only when combined with absolute direction _markers_.
15:52:51 <kosmikus> yes, what do you really want to do if you don't have knowledge about the absolute dir ...
15:53:22 <shaleh> unless you just assume that you only marked a path to food
15:53:41 <Heffalump> paths can branch and things
15:54:04 <Lor> In a way I feel that fully deterministic ants are not really what the contest should be about (though it is).
15:54:17 <Heffalump> they're not fully deterministic, they can get derailed by other ants
15:54:19 <Lor> If they hadn't specified the originating state so precisely, things would be much different.
15:54:50 <Lor> I mean fully deterministic in the sense that they begin with a well-known state and don't necessarily need to "adapt".
15:54:51 <kosmikus> I think the spec was pretty flexible
15:54:59 <Heffalump> lor: hmm, true
15:55:02 <shaleh> I assumed this would end up being a genetic algos problem.  No one seems to have done this though.  Appears that simulator development and speed made this not be feasible
15:55:14 <Lor> Suppose it hadn't been specified that all ants begin facing the same direction. What then?
15:55:15 <kosmikus> probably, one could have implemented a far more sophisticated search pattern than we have
15:55:38 <Heffalump> yes, Igloo and I realised later that we don't look to the side for food when searching, which is often silly
15:55:52 <Heffalump> but equally it saves us from the redteam traps (nasty little buggers those)
15:55:55 <Lor> The really impressive thing about ants should be that they manage to come up with a working society _naturally_, without anyone putting them in the right places.
15:56:02 <Heffalump> s/saves/sometimes saves/
15:56:16 <Heffalump> lor: but ants can follow directions more sensibly than we can, I suspect
15:56:19 <Lor> Indeed, they can even fix their hill if a big human steps on it.
15:56:26 <kosmikus> Lor: probably, one could still find out which ant is where on the anthill, and align them; it just would be more difficult
15:57:05 <Heffalump> yes, I think one could waste some time aligning them
15:57:06 <Lor> I mean, I wouldn't want the ants to work like a machine with exact timings and whatnot.
15:57:13 <Heffalump> it'd have taken a lot of mental bandwidth to figure out how, though
15:57:55 <shaleh> I wonder if anyone tried implementing a "mine sweeper" pattern?
15:58:00 <shaleh> form a line and walk
15:58:31 <kosmikus> shaleh: how would you treat collisions?
15:58:51 <shaleh> kosmikus: with rocks? or other things?
15:59:48 <shaleh> with rocks you just have every ant go left, or right
16:00:00 <kosmikus> shaleh: generally
16:00:17 <kosmikus> shaleh: but that'll destroy your line
16:00:21 <Heffalump> how do you signal that?
16:00:49 <Heffalump> you'd have to have some sort of protocol to say "is it safe to move?" "yes"
16:00:53 <shaleh> Heffalump: not sure, would have to ponder it.  I was figuring something like a walking chain
16:01:17 <kosmikus> Heffalump: if we should really have a relatively good entry, I might make an lhs2TeXed documented .lhs of our source file
16:01:21 <shaleh> hard part is you can not designate a leader
16:01:31 <Heffalump> kosmikus: okie dokie
16:01:47 <Heffalump> shaleh: just pick one extreme of the line
16:01:58 <kosmikus> Heffalump: is the final submission tagged?
16:02:03 <Heffalump> umm, ask Igloo
16:02:14 <shaleh> welp, time to head home
16:02:14 <Heffalump> but I don't think any of us pushed changes after we did submit ;-)
16:02:16 <shaleh> take care all
16:02:17 <kosmikus> Igloo: ?
16:02:18 <Heffalump> byebye
16:03:53 <kosmikus> Heffalump: those with the "evil keeper" must also keep absolute positions, or not?
16:04:21 <Heffalump> absolute _positions_?
16:04:28 <Heffalump> I don't think they need even absolute directions
16:04:53 <Heffalump> what they have is our keeper structure, but without the side guards; it points outwards with the jaws (not the middle) being the corner of the anthill
16:04:54 <Igloo> Ermmm, I can push a tag of what I think it is and you can verify ants produced
16:05:22 <Heffalump> friendly ants come and deliver food in the jaws by just walking past (there are three squares next to it so this is easy)
16:05:34 <Heffalump> enemy ant comes onto the square, keeper moves forwards, dead ant
16:05:48 <kosmikus> sorry, I meant dirs
16:05:51 <Igloo> OK, tag maybe_sub2 is what I think it is
16:06:02 <kosmikus> Igloo: thanks
16:06:04 <Heffalump> I think they can forget dirs.
16:06:17 <Heffalump> they have 6 of them, each pointing a different way
16:06:27 <Heffalump> I think our CSE would combine all 6.
16:06:37 <Igloo> Yeah, their keepers don't even need to know which way they are facing
16:06:39 <Heffalump> even if you coded them using absolute dirs
16:07:00 <kosmikus> right
16:08:41 <kosmikus> but we win against them, because they do not collect food?
16:08:48 <Heffalump> they collect it really slowly
16:09:01 <Heffalump> and our dontvisitfoehome version avoids their trap
16:09:25 <kosmikus> :)
16:09:37 <kosmikus> how many get caught in the other version?
16:09:42 <Igloo> They spend 5*6 ants on traps
16:09:44 <Heffalump> not sure, quite a few
16:09:58 <Igloo> Plus other ants circling the base
16:10:11 <Heffalump> their redteam2 uses nasty little trappy things that are like keepers but symmetric and can attack in two directions
16:10:17 <Heffalump> and they place those just by our base
16:10:46 <Heffalump> but we _still_ dodge enough of them and collect food fast enough to win
16:10:51 <kosmikus> but do they actually collect any food won from those traps?
16:10:52 <Heffalump> they suck at picking up the food they win that way
16:10:59 <Heffalump> they do, but not very fast
16:11:01 <Igloo> They don't actually manage to get most of the dead ants home too, I think
16:19:33 <Lor> It would be nice to have a way to note when the round is about to end in order to go fetch all the food in the traps.
16:19:49 <kosmikus> we thought about that
16:19:55 <Lor> Wonder what would make a good long-scale timer... walking around borders?
16:20:11 <kosmikus> we could have used the markers in our keeper structure to keep the time
16:20:21 <kosmikus> but the problem would have been to communicate the info
16:20:53 <kosmikus> only ants with food do actally go home and could learn about the current time this way
16:23:37 <Pseudonym> One of the things I noticed when reading the spec was that the concentrations of chemicals don't decay over time.
16:23:43 <Heffalump> yeah.
16:23:45 <Pseudonym> That would have been useful, I think.
16:23:52 <Heffalump> yeah
16:24:07 <Heffalump> it would have destroyed our strategy if individual markers had a half-life
16:24:12 <Pseudonym> "Real" ants have that so that old paths break down once the food along that path is depleted.
16:24:28 <Heffalump> oh, we explicitly destroyed paths when we failed to find food at the end
16:24:33 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
16:24:51 <Heffalump> by "useful" above I mean it might have made the problem better
16:24:57 <Heffalump> it would have screwed us over :-
16:24:57 <Heffalump> )
16:25:01 <Pseudonym> :-)
16:25:30 <Lor> It would also have been interesting if enemy trails could be destroyed.
16:25:52 <Lor> Or well, maybe not. Then you couldn't really have done anything useful.
16:26:12 <Heffalump> well, if it cost a lot of time to do it, you'd have to balance destroying stuff and the time wasted
16:26:28 <Bluelive> my ants just consumed the path when they follow it
16:26:41 <Bluelive> three followers for one carrying back food
16:27:49 <Bluelive> score after three maps
16:28:55 <Bluelive> best of urchin 314 redteam 298 mine 274  phantomax 216 fullbl2 220
16:29:56 <Heffalump> we're actually called Dunkosmiloolump, btw
16:30:21 <Bluelive> ah ok :)
16:33:39 <kosmikus> what does this score mean? average per map?
16:34:09 <Bluelive> no
16:34:24 <Bluelive> this is scoring according to the description
16:34:35 <Bluelive> 2 points for winning a round 1 point for a tie
16:34:57 <Bluelive> this is after sample[0..2].world
16:35:08 * kosmikus is confused
16:35:09 <Bluelive> playing in a pool of 29 ants
16:35:11 <Heffalump> ooh.
16:35:16 <Heffalump> the plt-scheme team posts to the list.
16:36:01 <Heffalump> the strategy they describe will kick our ant's butt.
16:36:16 <Bluelive> hmz what mail ?
16:36:36 <Heffalump> Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0406071903570.8262@anquetil>
16:36:45 <kosmikus> Heffalump: doesn't sound good ...
16:37:19 <Igloo> What is the guy's name?
16:37:19 <Heffalump> bloody hell, their solution is tiny - 867 states
16:37:27 <Heffalump> From: Guillaume Marceau <gmarceau@cs.brown.edu>
16:37:35 <Bluelive> pfft my solution is way smaller
16:38:00 <Bluelive> and still number three after redteam and dunko/urchin
16:38:20 <Heffalump> run that one :-)
16:38:24 <Heffalump> http://www.cs.brown.edu/~gmarceau/files/ant-plter.tar.gz
16:38:32 <Bluelive> ill try ;)
16:38:34 <Heffalump> it'll come out top, no questions (if it does what they describe)
16:39:06 <Bluelive> solution 1 or 2 
16:39:09 <Igloo> Hmm, fewer ants are fetching food so it might gather slower against stupid ants
16:39:16 <Heffalump> both, I guess; it seems quite simple
16:39:19 <Heffalump> igloo: it'll still get the 2 points though
16:39:27 <Igloo> Ah, good point
16:40:32 <Heffalump> bluelive: their solutions just differ in some tuning probabilities
16:42:31 <kosmikus> Heffalump: maybe we are lucky enough on some boards to collect enough food before they can block us completely
16:42:36 <Bluelive> pheromone pattern as you do it seems
16:42:53 <wagle> is there results yet for the icfp?
16:43:03 <Riastradh> No, they won't be announced until September.
16:43:08 <Heffalump> their smoothing algorithm is a neat idea (I did think of it, but I thought it'd be too hard to implement and would slow us down too much)
16:43:15 <Lor> I very strongly considered using the scheme macro system for the ant language, but I decided I just didn't have the time for it at that point.
16:43:23 <Lor> Besides, I'm addicted to types. :)
16:43:26 <Riastradh> Our entry used Scheme macros a bit.
16:43:46 <Bluelive> there throwing food out algorithm doesnt sseem to work against my ants, they seem to be turned into feed for me :)
16:43:46 <Heffalump> and they used GAs in just the right way; for tuning, not for discovering good strategies
16:43:51 <wagle> ocd macros?
16:44:02 <Riastradh> I designed a slightly higher-level ant language that handled the connection of states and nesting branches, and atop that were used Scheme macros.
16:44:35 <Bluelive> their marker pattern is much more sophisticated
16:45:55 <Lor> Oo, they have a very smart ant language.
16:47:22 <Heffalump> which is the source of the language?
16:47:22 <Heffalump> presumably not the strings of numbers in foo.ant
16:47:43 <det> By the way, it was hard to create drunk ants, I did not succeed... sorry...) (To understand, check my ICFP 2003 contest entry.) 
16:47:43 <det> from the guy who did the drunk racer :p
16:47:56 <Heffalump> I'd have expected it to be fairly trivial.
16:48:12 <Riastradh> Just flip out a lot.
16:48:14 <Riastradh> NINJA ANTS!
16:49:12 <Bluelive> hmz
16:49:22 <Bluelive> against plt.ant i lose 7:13
16:50:27 <wagle> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle graphics?
16:52:42 <wagle> ugh..  seemed funnier before i wrote it down
16:52:50 <Riastradh> s/Turtle/Ant/1
16:52:54 <Riastradh> That improves it a little bit.
16:53:52 <wagle> s/funnier/funny/
16:53:59 <Bluelive> Heffalump: the plt teams ant doesnt win from your ant
16:54:28 <wagle> how are you running ants against other teams?
16:54:44 <kosmikus> Bluelive: are you sure? :)
16:55:04 <Igloo> That was the impression I got from looking at the first profile being generated, but I was waiting for the lot to finish to check
16:55:28 <Igloo> We seem to collect far faster, but that might be due to start positions so I'm running them both ways round
16:55:33 <Bluelive> kosmikus: yes  urchin1: 108 plt: 58 redteam2: 58 mutant: 20
16:55:45 <kosmikus> nice
16:55:52 <Heffalump> wow.
16:55:56 * Heffalump starts to feel optimistic again
16:56:00 <Igloo> heh
16:56:03 <Bluelive> plt might be a nice challenge for the second place
16:56:15 <Heffalump> what they describe is what I'd have thought we should have done had we had the time.
16:56:17 <Igloo> I'm sure the judges will still manage to produce a set of maps we come near-bottom on  :-)
16:56:25 <kosmikus> has anyone tried the KISS entry?
16:56:36 <Bluelive> kosmikus: ill try it now
16:57:16 <kosmikus> Igloo: every ant will lose some maps ...
16:57:28 <Bluelive> kosmikus: which one, they pasted a few into their mail ?
16:57:35 <kosmikus> hmmm
16:58:06 <kosmikus> try the second first, assuming longer is better ...
16:58:28 <Igloo> They only gave their two submissions as I read it
16:58:41 <kosmikus> has anyone heard from droundy or shapr?
16:58:53 <Heffalump> droundy was in d3z's team
16:58:59 <Bluelive> running, answer in 5 mins
16:59:04 <Heffalump> we, errm, did quite well against that ant.
16:59:11 <kosmikus> ok
16:59:23 <kosmikus> did shapr participate?
16:59:31 <Heffalump> not sure, haven't heard from him
16:59:37 <Igloo> I suspect not
16:59:39 <Bluelive> matched against uchin, redteam, plt and mutant
16:59:46 <kosmikus> Bluelive: thanks
16:59:52 <Igloo> at 8am when we were going to bed the first time he was packing to go to EuroHaskell
17:00:01 <Heffalump> when is that?
17:00:06 <kosmikus> EuroPython, probably
17:00:11 <Igloo> I think he was leaving shortly
17:00:19 <Igloo> Err, one of the two
17:00:23 <kosmikus> starting tomorrow (wednesday), I think
17:00:30 <Bluelive> kosmikus: the first two maps it lost all 32 simulations
17:00:32 <Heffalump> I'm now really motivated to get together and hack, though I don't have time, and I suspect motivation will be much less without the deadline.
17:00:44 <Igloo> Blue: What did?
17:00:51 <Bluelive> Heffalump: without the constraints its not a contest
17:00:55 <kosmikus> Heffalump: you mean, improve our solution?
17:01:00 <kosmikus> don't ...
17:01:01 <Heffalump> nono, IM EuroHaskell
17:01:09 <kosmikus> ah
17:01:13 <Bluelive> Igloo: the kiss ant just pasted to the list loses all combats against the best four currently known to me
17:01:14 <kosmikus> yeah, I would be motivated, too
17:01:19 <Igloo> Ah, right
17:01:20 <Heffalump> hacking on the L.I.P. or whatever, or maybe on darcs :-)
17:01:24 <kosmikus> but I have taken three days off from my thesis
17:01:34 <kosmikus> I cannot afford doing the same again
17:01:55 <Heffalump> at least they were three days well spent, it seems :-) [and we had a lot of fun anyway]
17:02:03 <kosmikus> in one or two weeks time, though, I will decide whether to hack for a week or to write a popl paper ...
17:02:06 <Igloo> Yeah, t'was good
17:02:17 <Heffalump> (I still don't expect us to come very close to winning, but I reckon we're up for a top ten spot)
17:02:29 <kosmikus> yes, it was really fun -- the most entertaining icfp contest I had so far
17:02:31 <Igloo> It's a pity about the workshop overlap, but OTOH the fact there was a workshop at all meant kos was in town, which was good
17:02:55 <Heffalump> yes, we wouldn't have had anything like the entry we did without any one of the four of us, I think
17:02:56 <kosmikus> sure, the workshop was a good reason to be there
17:03:14 <kosmikus> but if the contest would have started on saturday morning, that would have been better
17:03:18 <Heffalump> I don't think we could have saved on that much sleep, TBH.
17:03:20 <Igloo> Yes, definitely
17:03:21 <Heffalump> perhaps a bit.
17:03:45 <kosmikus> I think we did use our time quite well
17:04:01 * Lor used his time lousily.
17:04:02 <kosmikus> and we had the keeper idea after 30 minutes or so ...
17:04:07 <Igloo> I think an optimal strategy involves sleeping twice during the contest. 3 times might make more sense if you have lots of things you can leave running on the second and 3rd sleeps, though
17:04:08 <Heffalump> except 5am to 8am on Saturday.
17:04:09 <Bluelive> i really wished i made a better compiler
17:04:30 <Lor> I spent ages fighting with gtk, trying to make things come out on the screen with a reasonable speed.
17:04:42 <Heffalump> kosmikus did the same with wxHaskell
17:04:46 <kosmikus> seems like it was a good thing that we thought about our strategy from the very beginning, so that when we finished the tools, we immediately knew what to implement
17:05:00 <kosmikus> Heffalump: don't remind me ...
17:05:07 <kosmikus> that was the less fun part
17:05:09 <Igloo> Yeah, and our ideas were being tweaked as we thought about them while doing other stuff
17:05:14 <Heffalump> our tools (certainly the simulator) is an order of magnitude at least slower than anyone else's I've heard of
17:05:27 <Heffalump> the language would have been better if we'd started writing throwaway code earlier
17:05:33 <Bluelive> kosmikus: the kiss2 ant is totally horrible :) it only one 5 out of 80 wiht 10 points, next from the bottom has 30:49 with 61 points
17:05:49 * Igloo thinks it's just the non-destructive updates killing performance, now I think about it
17:06:01 <kosmikus> ok, so they claim wrongly that they're doing fine
17:06:04 <Heffalump> you never tried using ST?
17:06:12 <Heffalump> who are K.I.S.S?
17:06:19 <Igloo> Everyone else ought to be O(1) read and write, whereas we could either be O(1)+O(n) or O(log n)+O(log n)
17:06:20 <Bluelive> next time ill help you guys with a vm written in an imperative language
17:06:56 <Igloo> No - maybe I just shouldn't have bothered trying nice functional code for the simulator
17:06:57 <Heffalump> oh, ST + STArray would have been needed, duh
17:07:07 <Heffalump> the compiler used far too many finite maps too.
17:07:12 <Bluelive> ugh if complexity is your problem then it will never be a fast solution, i often just write something fast only avoiding algorithmic complexity and then start profiling
17:07:34 <kosmikus> doesn't matter now ... compiler speed is irrelevant :)
17:07:45 <Igloo> But I spent the simulator hacking time trying to diagnose the space leaks instead of just rewriting it with mutable arrays
17:07:49 <Heffalump> yes, but I didn't know it would be mostly irrelevant when I started writing it
17:08:56 <Igloo> Next year, remind me I said the simulator should probably use mutable arrays and to hell with functionalness  :-)
17:08:56 <Heffalump> it could conceivably have turned into a major bottleneck with making more complicated ants
17:09:06 <Lor> Have all people publicized their entries so eagerly in the previous contests? Doesn't it kind of spoil the excitement of the official results?
17:09:08 * Igloo contemplates an at job
17:09:23 <kosmikus> I admire you for the CSE implementation that you produced in, what, 15 minutes? Igloo did the start sequence brilliantly, and Duncan's profiler idea was simple, but great. I would've never though about that possibility.
17:09:29 <Igloo> People just aren't interested by the time the results come out
17:09:32 <Heffalump> the official results are far too long time away
17:09:42 <Igloo> There's a mild interest in one's own ant, but no excitement left
17:09:52 <Heffalump> and their email announcing contest end does ask people to produce web pages
17:10:01 <Heffalump> (which contradicts the Rules section of the contest web site)
17:10:14 <Igloo> Your collision stuff worked a treat as well
17:10:16 <Bluelive> Lor: well the offical results are half september, 9 weeks or something
17:10:36 <Heffalump> kosmikus: it was a bit longer than that, I think; but I had the idea at the back of my mind right the way through
17:11:07 <Heffalump> and it's a horrible algorithm complexity wise - as Oege pointed out when I told him about it, DFA minimisation would have been the right solution (but I'd never have written a correct implementation of that in time)
17:12:09 <kosmikus> Heffalump: didn't they always encourage web pages after the contest is over?
17:12:17 <Heffalump> yes, that's my experience
17:12:46 <kosmikus> so where was a rule contradicting that?
17:13:56 <Bluelive> well im going for some sleep
17:14:06 <Heffalump> on the Rules page
17:14:13 <Bluelive> ill post the results of the whole 10 maps 29 ants thing in about 10 houres i think
17:14:34 <Heffalump> >> In the spirit of friendly competition, teams should
17:14:34 <Heffalump> >> refrain from discussing strategies or sharing code
17:14:34 <Heffalump> >> until the winners have been announced at ICFP.
17:14:42 <Riastradh> Heheh.
17:14:57 <Lukhas> hrm :)
17:14:58 <Heffalump> bluelive: are you using that zip file of all ants from Martin Tampe?
17:15:21 <Bluelive> no i started the program before that, and with a runtime of ten houres im not going to restart
17:15:35 <Heffalump> heh
17:15:42 <Bluelive> (and every ant added just about doubles the time needed)
17:15:58 <Heffalump> surely the tournament is O(n^2) ?
17:16:19 <Bluelive> yeah im to lazy to calculate what the growth is if you do a n+1
17:16:34 <Heffalump> O(n) for a single ant addition
17:17:14 <Igloo> You could obviously tweak your scripts to be able to add individual ants later, though
17:17:33 <Heffalump> so about 40 minutes per ant added for the next few ants
17:18:11 <Bluelive> still i would need to restart, and its allready 5 houres into the run
17:18:58 <Bluelive> 2915 simulations played, im using the older machine also so its not as fast as what i did during competition
17:19:57 <Bluelive> 8410 todo 
17:20:14 <Heffalump> hmm, I think our idea of pushing the head ant out of a guard structure after delivering into the middle of it is unique so far
17:20:42 <Bluelive> Heffalump: yeah great tactic, making the group invincible is also great
17:20:43 <kosmikus> I think that was Igloo's idea ...
17:21:07 <Bluelive> what really would be a good idea if you could form a ribbon made up of redteam like eaters
17:21:14 <Igloo> We've only seen oen other team using the general idea haven't we?
17:21:37 <Igloo> (the one with a name like rubik)
17:21:40 <Heffalump> http://www.grayproductions.net/icfp04/ant.html does too
17:22:14 <Heffalump> I thought using the guard ants on the sides to make it invincible was you and me, kosmikus - while Igloo was getting the drinks at the pub.
17:22:45 <Heffalump> bluelive: I was wondering about surrounding a base with the red team X-wing eaters
17:22:45 <Igloo> The guard ants weren't me, the leaving via the other end and switching places was
17:23:01 <Heffalump> oh, yes, mixing up what kosmikus was referring to
17:23:03 <kosmikus> Heffalump: yes, the guard structure per se was you and me
17:23:38 <Heffalump> when was the idea about profiling? Sunday morning or Monday morning?
17:23:49 <kosmikus> monday, I think
17:23:49 <Bluelive> the whole structure thing was somethign i didnt think about, i tried a more bottom up emergent behavior style but that didnt work out completly
17:23:53 <Igloo> Blue: The problem is that moving clusters of ants without losing formation is tricky
17:24:27 <kosmikus> but I'm not sure ...
17:24:28 <Igloo> No, because I suggested adding deaths to it Sunday night
17:24:31 <Bluelive> Igloo: locked step synchronisation
17:24:34 <Heffalump> is it possible to 'roll' a structure to keep it invulnerable, btw?
17:24:34 <kosmikus> right
17:24:35 <Igloo> So it must have already existed  :-)
17:25:06 <kosmikus> Heffalump: yes, I think so
17:25:16 * Heffalump considers making a timeline for our webpage
17:25:17 <kosmikus> but moving seems to be impossible
17:25:21 <Igloo> My intuition said no, at least not without more ants
17:25:26 <Bluelive> i tried a ring thing, trying to keep a closed ring growing from the nest, couldnt keep it solid though, anyways, how would you gather food
17:25:30 <kosmikus> I tried to do that one night before sleep
17:25:32 <Heffalump> I meant "is there any structure that you can move by 'rolling'"?
17:25:38 <Igloo> Err, what do you mean by roll if not move?
17:25:56 <kosmikus> changing the direction in which the opening faces?
17:26:01 <Heffalump> bluelive: only need 30 ants for a closed ring
17:26:13 <Heffalump> kosmikus: but a 5 ant guard is vulnerable (I think)
17:26:20 <Heffalump> so you need at least the extra 2
17:26:30 <Bluelive> Heffalump: you need near 400 to go to the whole map
17:26:46 <kosmikus> Heffalump: I guess I'm not completely sure what you mean
17:26:48 <Heffalump> and anyway changing the point of the opening doesn't help with moving the entire structure
17:27:05 <Igloo> 5 static ants aren't vulnerable
17:27:09 <Heffalump> imagine a rigid triangle; you can roll it along the ground in bumpy steps
17:27:10 <kosmikus> btw, I just made screenshots of the startup sequence, but I won't write any text describing it anymore tonight
17:27:34 <Heffalump> it's not possible to roll a 3-ant triangle on a hex grid, but I was imagining something similar but bigger.
17:27:55 <Igloo> There are some docs Ganesh wrote that it might be sensible to start from in the submission tarball
17:27:55 <kosmikus> no, I don't think it works with all participating ants being invulnerable at all times
17:28:08 * Igloo can't remember how brief they are though
17:28:34 <kosmikus> I know, I've seen the /docs directory ...
17:28:55 <kosmikus> I should go to bed, otherwise I'll not survive losing one hour by time difference
17:28:58 <Heffalump> you had the entire flight to look at our stuff at leisure :-)
17:28:59 <Heffalump> night.
17:28:59 <Bluelive> what about a 4 ant square that moves ? the vunerable extension gets protected if timed correctly almost immediatly, and you should be able to sense a trap 100% of the time i think
17:29:23 <Heffalump> 'almost' is not what I had in mind, though.
17:29:32 <kosmikus> Heffalump: I didn't. Instead, I watched the trap in action.
17:29:54 <Heffalump> the bait?
17:29:57 <Heffalump> did it work, then?
17:30:00 <Bluelive> they really should let some ants escape
17:30:06 <Heffalump> I haven't heard many reports of it working against other ants.
17:30:10 <Bluelive> with the trail it would be much more attractive
17:30:11 <kosmikus> sometimes it works
17:30:20 <kosmikus> we could have done that part much better, I think
17:30:26 <Heffalump> yeah.
17:30:30 <Heffalump> It was thought of too late.
17:30:33 <kosmikus> but still, if the enemy ants fall for the bait
17:30:40 <kosmikus> then it produces good results
17:31:12 <kosmikus> ok, night
17:31:16 <Heffalump> nn
17:31:38 <Bluelive> the perfectly protected food in combination with fast farmers is often enough, aslong as you dont lose ants to the opposition
17:31:58 <Bluelive>  guess thats why your #1 in my contest results
17:32:10 <Heffalump> agreed.
17:32:34 <Heffalump> (actually the food isn't _perfectly_ protected, but we have to be pretty unlucky to lose the protection)
17:32:57 <kosmikus|away> it's perfectly protected, but we can get stuck
17:32:58 <Igloo> No, protection is guaranteed
17:33:01 <Igloo> Yeah
17:33:14 <Igloo> Because if the race happens we have an ant stuck on the food drop too
17:33:27 <Igloo> Trying to become the keeper
17:33:30 <Heffalump> oh, so we just get a dead ex-keeper?
17:33:36 <Heffalump> OIC.
17:33:45 <Heffalump> and the guard points continue to protect themselves and the stuck ant.
17:33:50 <Igloo> Yup
17:33:53 <Heffalump> we just don't deliver more food.
17:33:54 <kosmikus|away> right
17:34:13 <kosmikus|away> at least, if no one accidentially implemented an emergency escape for the ant trying to become the keeper ;)
17:34:20 <Heffalump> hehe
17:34:49 <Igloo> It almost certainly couldn't escape even if it tried
17:35:03 * Heffalump thinks about a decompiler some more
17:35:07 <Igloo> Oh, once the easy food has gone it probably could
17:35:23 <kosmikus|away> decompiler?
17:35:31 <Heffalump> decompile raw ants into nice high-level code
17:35:46 <Heffalump> that would be very cool
17:35:48 <Riastradh> Of what use would that be?
17:35:59 <Heffalump> you could read other people's raw ants in a common high-level format
17:36:10 <Heffalump> you'd need to do some work manually to assign comments
17:36:14 <Heffalump> or labels
17:36:28 <Lor> It would still be a pretty low-level language.
17:36:31 <Igloo> If they have comments you can use some heuristics
17:36:45 <Heffalump> you have to use heuristics anyway to find the loops
17:37:03 <Heffalump> well, the irreducible ones, anyway; I suspect many would be
17:37:09 <Lor> You could find loops and switches, but not higher-level stuff like alternatives of the same strategy for different states.
17:37:14 <Igloo> I just mean you can sometimes guess a meaningful label
17:37:28 <Heffalump> lor: that definitely could be done with a heuristic
17:37:34 <Igloo> e.g. I'd expect a good decompiler to get sit and attack labels in the redteam 2
17:37:39 <Heffalump> anyone keeping absolute direction will stand out a mile
17:37:57 <Heffalump> because each turn will be followed by code in a different copy of the same block
17:38:04 <Heffalump> s/code/a jump to code/
17:38:30 <Igloo> Why is the contest so far before the conference, anyway?
17:38:39 <Igloo> Oh, I guess the winners need to make plans etc
18:46:02 * SamB formulates a conspiracy theory relating the ants on his desk to the ICFP contest
18:47:49 <det> SamB: ICFP is God's front for programming the world!
18:50:18 * SamB moves the ant trap closer to where they come up the side
21:57:57 <tmoertel> The Frictionless Bananas held both direction and food status in state.
22:16:27 <det> tmoertel: interesting mutterance!
22:16:40 <tmoertel> More explanation: http://www.sawicki.us/icfp/2004/
23:13:56 * cuelebre saluda por la mañana
23:27:28 <earthy> good morning cuelebre
23:27:58 <Pseudonym> I hope everyone is keeping an eye on Venus.
23:28:05 <Pseudonym> Though not the naked eye, of course.
23:31:03 <[dan]> Ah yeah, that's started, hasn't it?
23:44:42 <earthy> yup
23:44:46 <earthy> 'bout an hour ago.
23:44:54 <earthy> now to find a pin to make a little hole in a pice of paper with
23:47:00 <d3z> It is very hard for me to see through the earth :-(
23:47:59 <Pseudonym> Yes, I keep meaning to speak to someone about that.
23:48:05 <Pseudonym> http://lbtest.jcu.edu.au/events/TransitVenus/
23:48:11 <Pseudonym> That's not bad if you want to see.
