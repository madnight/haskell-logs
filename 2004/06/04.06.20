07:08:19 <ozone> Igloo: do you more or less grok arrows?
07:08:32 <Igloo> I've never looked into them
07:10:46 <ozone> ah, ok
07:11:25 <ozone> i'll have to do some investigation of how you may be able to use them for graph-based computations.  maybe that'll be a nice excuse for me to play with haskell at work :)
07:11:37 <ozone> type-safe gst ;)
07:12:03 <Igloo> Ah, yes, I'd forgotten you did multimedia stuff
07:13:55 <ozone> Igloo: interesting, reading irc logs now about it ...
07:53:28 <Grind> hello
07:53:54 <Grind> I'm using the listings package with literate haskell 
07:54:18 <Grind> got this def from the wiki:
07:54:20 <Grind> \lstnewenvironment{code}{\lstset{language=Haskell,basicstyle=\small}}{} 
07:54:47 <Grind> I always frame the code with:
07:54:52 <Grind> \begin{framed}
07:54:52 <Grind> \begin{code}
07:54:52 <Grind> \end{code}
07:54:53 <Grind> \end{framed}
07:55:12 <Grind> is there a way to include the frame in the "code" definition?
07:55:32 <Grind> I've tried: \lstnewenvironment{code}{\lstset{language=Haskell,basicstyle=\small}\begin{framed}}{\end{framed}}
07:56:17 <Grind> also tried defining the lstnewenvironment as an auxiliar env, and then the "code" env with the newenvironment command, and include the frame there...
07:56:25 <Grind> none worked :-/
08:03:55 <Grind> nevermind
08:04:01 <Grind> found a workaround
08:04:02 <Grind> :)
08:47:52 <buggmuzz> Hey all. (hasn't been here for two years, it sure has grown a lot)
08:50:10 <Riastradh> We've been assimilating.
08:50:10 <Cale> hi
08:50:43 * buggmuzz looks around for the older regulars
08:52:03 <buggmuzz> Hm only names that seem somewhat familiar are dennisb and possibly firefly
10:02:03 <no-bo-dy> quelqun qui parle francais?...
10:03:20 <buggmuzz> oui
10:04:19 <no-bo-dy> so how do you say "for whom the bell tolls" in franch?
10:04:23 <no-bo-dy> so how do you say "for whom the bell tolls" in french?
10:05:29 * buggmuzz shrugs, heh
10:05:46 <buggmuzz> I know how to say 'yes' and count to ten and some other things
10:05:59 <no-bo-dy> heh...
10:07:03 <no-bo-dy> quite a self-esteem ... i'd say...
10:07:21 <vegai> Pour qui sonne le glas?
10:09:20 <no-bo-dy> plein merci...
10:14:08 <vegai> anyone tried the wx gui for darcs?
10:14:16 <tautologico> not me
10:14:48 <kosmikus> I did, a while ago
10:14:56 <kosmikus> back then, it didn't seem to do much
10:15:01 <kosmikus> don't know if it has changed
10:16:20 <vegai> would it be usable for the slightly computer-illiterate?
10:17:47 <vegai> I guess not...
10:26:12 <kosmikus> from what I have seen, it was not usable as a full replacement of the command line interface yet; but as I said, I haven't checked the latest releases ...
15:31:02 <firefly> vegai: I have - just ignore it.  It is easier to use the interactive tty prompts than it is to use the wx "gui".
17:04:09 <zugzwang> Anyone know the first thing about Pappy (http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/)?
17:26:07 <_SamB_> how often do you find yourself writing a typeclass with no methods?
17:27:50 <SamB> hmm, apparantly you don't need a where when you have no methods ;-)
17:36:05 * SamB wonders where everyone is
17:42:09 <zugzwang> there's nobody here but us chickens
17:42:35 <Pseudonym> SamB: I do all the time.
17:43:01 <SamB> Pseudonym: what do you use them for?
17:43:02 <Pseudonym> If I have a lot of typeclass constraints, making a single typeclass to encapsulate the constraints saves a lot of typing.
17:43:15 <SamB> ah
17:43:31 <SamB> I'm playing with natural numbers ;-)
17:43:38 <Pseudonym> Here's an example of one I used recently:
17:43:43 <Pseudonym> > class (Monad m, Ord t) => ReVars m t
17:43:44 <Pseudonym> > instance (Monad m, Ord t) => ReVars m
17:44:00 <Pseudonym> Left off a t
17:44:08 <SamB> Pseudonym: I could tell ;-)
17:44:23 <Pseudonym> But that's one typeclass constraint instead of two.
17:44:33 <Pseudonym> Which makes the program look a lot nicer./
17:45:37 <SamB> good, my multiplication seems to work nicely ;-)
18:03:15 <SamB> now if only I could pass around type classes...
18:03:30 <SamB> then, I could have type folds ;-)
18:04:59 <Pseudonym> Well you kind of can.
18:05:21 <Pseudonym> In the sense that records with higher-ranked functions as members are like type classes.
18:05:41 <Pseudonym> They're not passed implicitly, but you can't have everything.

21:28:59 <Cale> Then you have stuff like the hyperreals.
21:34:47 <desrt> guhhhh
21:34:57 * desrt codes all freakin weekend
21:35:12 <Pseudonym> desrt needs a life, by the sound of it
21:35:21 <Pseudonym> Mind you, I've done that too when I've been on call.
21:35:24 <desrt> i rewrote my 2000 lines
21:35:26 <Pseudonym> If you can't really go anywhere...
21:35:31 <desrt> they are now 1500 lines
21:35:34 <desrt> and ridiculously more modular
21:35:38 <Pseudonym> Oh, that's good.
21:35:45 <desrt> i love it when code shrinks :)
21:36:56 <desrt> i've also become an at&t graphviz junkie
21:37:05 <desrt> i use it for everything these days
21:38:26 <SamB> desrt: that is probably the nicest piece of proprietary software ever ;-)
21:38:43 <desrt> it's proprietariness seriously bothers me
21:38:45 <desrt> *its
21:46:38 <desrt> http://www.desrt.ca/depgraph.png
22:12:26 <Pseudonym> Well, that was a waste of time.
22:12:51 <Pseudonym> The way they allocate concert tickets nowadays is horribly inefficient.
22:12:57 <Pseudonym> I propose a modification.
22:13:23 <Pseudonym> I propose a system similar to airline bookings, where you don't actually get your seat allocations until you turn up.
22:13:38 <Pseudonym> Or at least, the allocations aren't made straight away.
22:14:14 <Verbophobe> People wouldn't go for that.  When you pay for "front row center", you want it written on your ticket...
22:14:16 <Pseudonym> Rather, you buy a number of seats in a block, and once the block is filled, then the system works out optimal allocations.
22:14:30 <Pseudonym> Oh, I have no problem with that.
22:14:44 <Pseudonym> The 'blocks" could be quite small.
22:15:02 <Pseudonym> The problem was that within half an hour of tickets going on sale for this concert, there were like 100 seats left, but all of them single.
22:15:07 <Pseudonym> Which is inefficient.
22:15:21 <Verbophobe> Oh.  I see what you mean.
22:15:36 <Verbophobe> Yeah, that does suck.
22:15:43 <Pseudonym> Indeed.
22:16:10 <Verbophobe> You should start your own venue and host concerts with your own ticketing system.
22:16:15 <Pseudonym> Indeed.
22:16:23 <Verbophobe> You could, perhaps, even put little advertisements for Haskell on the tickets.
22:16:50 <Pseudonym> Do you think I'd be able to sign up The Eagles, or do you think they'd prefer to play in other peoples' venues?
22:17:06 <Verbophobe> Are the eagles still toghether?
22:17:10 <Verbophobe> Or alive, for that matter?
22:17:12 <Pseudonym> Most of them.
22:17:21 <Pseudonym> One of them is suing the others, and they're suing him in return.
22:17:26 <Pseudonym> So my wife tells me.
22:17:44 <Verbophobe> Ah, well, that could complicate matters...
22:17:51 <Verbophobe> As long as you sign Joe Walsh, I'm there.
22:17:54 <Pseudonym> But the rest of them are still together, kind of.
22:18:45 <Pseudonym> Don Felder.
22:18:50 <Pseudonym> That's the one who's not there.
22:19:10 <Verbophobe> I always knew he was a dick.
22:19:21 <Pseudonym> You clearly know more than me.
22:19:32 <Verbophobe> I'm just bluffing.
22:19:46 <Verbophobe> The only Eagles member I know is Joe Walsh...
22:19:55 <Pseudonym> The Eagles would be my wife's topic were she to be a contestant on Mastermind, or whatever the modern equivalent is.
22:20:05 <Verbophobe> "Beat the Geeks?"
22:20:11 <Pseudonym> The Einstein Factor, probable.
23:44:45 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
23:44:58 <ozone> morning shae
23:45:36 <Pseudonym> G'day.
23:51:24 <shapr> anything exciting happening?
