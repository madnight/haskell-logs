00:51:39 <Verbophobe> @hitchcock
00:52:23 <CLxyz> hrm..
00:52:30 <CLxyz> interesting, nothing @ the library on haskell
00:52:36 <CLxyz> yet there's like 8 books on sml
05:43:41 <Lemmih> How would one implement Dijktra's shortest path algorithm in Haskell?
05:52:07 <reffie> very carefully
06:20:25 <bourbaki> hiho
06:24:40 <Lukhas> hi bourbaki 
06:25:47 <bourbaki> hell-o ;)
06:32:47 <SyntaxNinja> y0
06:33:46 <bourbaki> LLA - punch ;)
06:40:02 * Lemmih is annoyed.
07:21:37 <SyntaxNinja> here's an attempt at making a concurrency abstraction via arrows & channels.  I hope it doesn't look to dumb. comments welcome: http://www.syntaxpolice.org/tmp/Parallel.hs
07:21:55 <bourbaki> cool
07:22:04 <bourbaki> got a paper about that?
07:22:26 <SyntaxNinja> heh. no. I don't think it's in that league.
07:22:44 <SyntaxNinja> but you may be able to convince me otherwise; it'll make me feel better for taking so long to figure it out.
07:22:47 <SyntaxNinja> I guess I should slap a license on that.
07:23:05 <bourbaki> my thesis is going is slightly the same direction
07:23:15 <SyntaxNinja> sorry that there's extra cruft in there; I can clean it up.
07:24:45 <bourbaki> im not too familiar with the arrow concept
07:25:00 <bourbaki> do you know about cartesian closed categories?
07:25:20 <SyntaxNinja> no, I don't know what that means.
07:25:24 <Igloo> Does the >>> instance satisfy the laws?
07:26:12 <Heffalump> well, it's correctly typed.
07:26:15 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo:  I haven't checked.
07:26:18 <Igloo> Oh, I see what's going on
07:26:19 <Heffalump> it looks ok to me
07:27:18 <SyntaxNinja> my real goal is to be able to do parallel AFRP, but I think it'll look totally different.
07:27:32 <bourbaki> afrp?
07:27:46 <SyntaxNinja> Arrowized Functional Reactive Programming
07:27:53 <SyntaxNinja> haskell.org/yampa I think
07:27:59 <bourbaki> ah sounds cool
07:28:52 <bourbaki> that all goes into the direction of my idea :)
07:29:00 <bourbaki> i got to read on all that in my vacation
07:29:13 <SyntaxNinja> bourbaki: there's a yampa mailing list
07:29:17 <SyntaxNinja> bourbaki: so what's your idea?
07:29:33 <bourbaki> i want to write programs with graphs
07:29:43 <bourbaki> also in that reactive style
07:29:51 <bourbaki> they are like automatas
07:30:05 <bourbaki> but they have a topology and you can do some topological stuff on them
07:30:15 <bourbaki> like glue stuff together etc
07:30:31 <bourbaki> and i want to be able to do proofs on programs as well
07:31:04 <bourbaki> and i want to make the programs categories
07:31:22 <bourbaki> though i am not too sure if i do anything right in that field
07:31:37 <bourbaki> all my programs are cartesian closed
07:31:46 <bourbaki> that is all channels can be combined
07:32:06 <bourbaki> and that way you can have something like concurrency i think
07:32:28 <bourbaki> that is a program of more then one thread so to say is just a tuple of states of channels
07:32:41 <bourbaki> does that make any sense :)?
07:33:00 <SyntaxNinja> yes kinda :)
07:33:05 <SyntaxNinja> sounds interesting :)
07:33:15 <bourbaki> i want to apply it to ai mainly
07:33:36 <SyntaxNinja> what kind of AI?
07:33:37 <bourbaki> i try to do all the basic ai things with it so you can properly combine all these methods
07:33:45 <bourbaki> neural networks for example
07:33:57 <SyntaxNinja> not abductive inference :)
07:33:59 <SyntaxNinja> ?
07:34:03 <bourbaki> or stuff that you would find in cognitive archetectures
07:34:10 <SyntaxNinja> does something make you think that this is particularly suited to AI?
07:34:13 <bourbaki> heh abductive ;)?
07:34:32 <bourbaki> yes i like the idea of the compositionability
07:34:57 <bourbaki> you can in the end combine different methods within one "language"
07:35:09 <bourbaki> and you can see the structure of what you do
07:35:14 <SyntaxNinja> hm
07:35:16 <bourbaki> these graph programs
07:35:47 <bourbaki> i also hope to be able to get quotient spaces on these programs
07:36:12 <bourbaki> and the over all thing is pretty simple
07:36:19 <bourbaki> i like simplicity over anything
07:36:36 <SyntaxNinja> heh. I'm not so sure of that ;)
07:36:56 <bourbaki> well i have an rudimentary implementation in lisp already
07:37:04 <bourbaki> based on irc  :)
07:37:22 <bourbaki> i dont have an editor yet though
07:37:48 <bourbaki> and i will have to implement a neural network and a simple automaton for the thesis
07:38:28 <bourbaki> what do you think would make it complex?
07:39:27 <SyntaxNinja> oh, I don't know. I just thought it was funny that you described something very much on the edge of my ability to understand and then said you like simplicity.
07:39:45 <bourbaki> heh
07:39:56 <bourbaki> well explaining things is beyond my ability
07:40:16 <bourbaki> the thing is that i will have to show that its legal what i do
07:41:16 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: simplicity is often achieved by overly-abstract thought, sadly :-(
07:41:24 <bourbaki> i mean these programs can have alot of different places where they run cause they can be asyncronous and i try to show that they could also have been calculated syncronous thats what that ccc is for
07:41:56 <bourbaki> yeah the idea is so simple but the stuff behind it is sometimes mind boggleing :)
07:42:15 <TheHunter> bourbaki, which university are you at?
07:42:52 <bourbaki> osnabrueck, germany
07:43:04 <TheHunter> ah, thx
07:43:07 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: I'm not saying it's _overly_ abstract... but not something that I can grok in passing
07:43:08 <bourbaki> thats my own project though
07:43:38 <bourbaki> i hope though that i can convince them that its so cool that i can write my masters thesis about it also :)
07:46:39 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: yeah, know the feeling though
07:46:55 <Philippa> it's overly-abstract in terms of being easy to grok
07:47:11 <bourbaki> grok?
07:47:22 <bourbaki> i usually drink that ;)
07:50:11 <MakeMyDay> data Node 	= [Node] String [Node] | End  
07:50:18 <MakeMyDay> is something wrong with this definition?
07:50:51 <ludde> you need to give the constructor a name
07:50:52 <Philippa> The first constructor doesn't have a name
07:50:56 <Philippa> jinx!
07:51:12 <ludde> jinx?
07:51:54 * Philippa declines to explain childish behaviour :-)
07:51:58 <sazzle> heh
07:52:13 <ludde> is that something you say when two people say the same thing?
07:52:19 <sazzle> ludde: nope
07:52:34 <ludde> so what is it? :)
07:52:39 <Heffalump> errm, I thought it was
07:52:48 <Heffalump> and I thought you had to say exactly the same thing for it to be a jinx
07:52:54 <sazzle> it's like puttin g a bad spell on someone
07:53:03 <sazzle> 'i jinxed you'
07:53:05 <ludde> then that person is not allowed to talk ?
07:53:17 <sazzle> not in my school playground
07:53:46 <sazzle> they just have bad luck
07:53:51 <ludde> ok
07:53:57 <Heffalump> well, Aussie customs are weird, clearly ;-)
07:54:11 <sazzle> oi! :-P
07:54:57 * Philippa bemoans the lack of Parsec for C#
07:55:14 <MakeMyDay> data Node 	= [Pre Node] String [Post Node] | End  
07:55:16 <Heffalump> port it to SML
07:55:17 <MakeMyDay> ?
07:55:26 <sazzle> MakeMyDay: you need a constructor
07:55:43 <sazzle> End is one constructor, you need one for the other bit
07:56:08 <MakeMyDay> ah
07:57:10 <MakeMyDay> meh ok thx.
07:57:18 <MakeMyDay> Stupid me
08:56:54 <Igloo> Anyone know if putMVar blocks until a takeMVar happens?
08:58:38 * Igloo tests and concludes not
08:58:54 <ibid> i would have guessed not
08:59:21 <ibid> i assume it's just a mutex-protected variable
08:59:34 <ibid> those do not do rendezvous semantics
09:00:30 <Igloo> *nod*
09:01:23 <ibid> in fact, had i read what you asked correctly, i would have immediately seen that i know it doesn't
09:01:40 <ibid> i've used MVars to store state in a single-threaded system
09:02:11 <ibid> (i misread your question as whether takeMVar blocks before puMVar happens, if none has yet happened)
09:02:18 <ibid> putMVar
09:02:42 <Igloo> How are they Why are they better than IORefs in that situation?
09:03:01 <ibid> i did not know of IORefs at that time :)
09:03:28 <Igloo> :-)
09:03:30 <ibid> besides, i considered a plus that if that module would later be implanted into a multithreaded environment, it'd still work
09:04:38 <Igloo> *nod*
09:05:28 <ibid> it was an evil hack to allow behind-the-scenes flyweight-style id's in a language processor i wrote
09:05:54 <ibid> (ie. string interning while presenting a pure interface)
09:06:23 <ibid> i think i used MVars to store the FiniteMaps

11:00:19 <Marvin--> hey syntax
11:14:13 <SyntaxLaptop> hihi Marvin--
11:20:24 <Igloo> In the FFI, is safety relevant for wrapper foreign imports?
11:21:51 <Igloo> Oh, it's defaulting to safe anyway
11:48:46 <Riastradh> Cale, did you figure out any practical applications of a graph monad?
11:52:16 <SyntaxLaptop> is it fundamentally nonsense to try and make monadic (g) code that looks like g'?:
11:52:16 <SyntaxLaptop> {-g f x = do (a,(b, c)) <- f (x,c)
11:52:16 <SyntaxLaptop>            return a-}
11:52:16 <SyntaxLaptop> g' f x = let (a,(b, c)) = f (x,c)
11:52:16 <SyntaxLaptop>              in a
11:53:30 <Heffalump> I don't follow what you mean by monadic.
11:53:38 <Heffalump> you seem to have commented out the really monadic bit.
11:53:49 <SyntaxLaptop> well, in the first version f returns a monad.
11:53:57 <SyntaxLaptop> right, g is what I want to write, but of course it doesn't work.
11:54:14 <Heffalump> because there are no actual monads involved?
11:54:34 <Marvin--> If the c:s are the catch, use mdo?
11:54:51 <SyntaxLaptop> Marvin--: yeah, the cs are the catch
11:54:55 <Heffalump> oh, I didn't notice the recursive thing.
11:55:01 <Heffalump> Yes, use mdo. You need to be in MonadFix.
11:55:08 <Marvin--> SyntaxLaptop: then you should definitely look at MonadFix and mdo
11:55:21 <SyntaxLaptop> Marvin--: thanks!
11:56:32 <SyntaxLaptop> eeeeeenteresting
11:58:12 <SyntaxLaptop> I am such a babe in the wood when it comes to syntax extensions
12:06:45 * Riastradh lumbers along and mauls that babe in the wood.
12:09:39 * SyntaxLaptop chews off leg and limps away
12:40:52 <bourbaki> bk
14:01:54 <firefly> Philippa: Just saw your posting in comp.lang.functional about the ML Kit :)
14:07:12 <Marvin--> woot, Galaxy Quest
14:08:00 <ibid> a fabulous film, that :)
14:08:05 <Marvin--> gotta love Alan Rickman
14:08:38 <Riastradh> And I'm _never_ saying that _stupid_ line ever again!
14:09:26 <Marvin--> "weeeee needyourhelp"
14:12:44 <Riastradh> 'And remember: mum's the word!'   'Mum?  Mum, mum, mum.  Mum mum!'
14:13:16 <Marvin--> the Thermians rock
14:15:24 <Marvin--> "her translator is broken"
14:15:32 <Marvin--> man this is rich
14:16:18 <chucky> marvin--: Thanks for reminding me. :)
14:31:49 <ibid> "practice driving"
14:37:59 <Marvin--> "take her out"
14:38:05 <Marvin--> "excuse me?"
14:51:43 <ibid> *screeeeeeeeeeeeech*
14:54:29 <Marvin--> crewman number six
14:56:07 <ibid> i am always thrown out of suspension of disbelief from that one
14:56:17 <ibid> crewman number six looks nothing like patric mcgoohan :)
14:57:06 <ibid> "at least he's outside" (or something like that...)
14:59:40 <Riastradh> Be seeing you!
14:59:55 <ibid> who is number one?
15:00:11 <Riastradh> We want information...
15:00:17 <ibid> that would be telling
15:01:15 <Riastradh> You won't get it!
15:01:24 <ibid> by hook or by crook, we will.
15:01:30 <ibid> (sp?)
15:01:34 <Riastradh> (Hmm, kind of out of order, I guess.)
15:01:39 <ibid> yeah
15:02:02 <ibid> i was kind of disappointed you didn't continue the number game ;)
15:02:22 <Riastradh> The number game?
15:02:27 <ibid> 00:59  <ibid> who is number one?
15:02:37 <Riastradh> Oh, that I didn't answer that?
15:02:41 <ibid> yeah :)
15:02:48 <Riastradh> I ought to have...
15:03:13 <ibid> you are number six
15:03:19 <Riastradh> Who is number one?
15:03:27 <ibid> you are, number six
15:03:57 <Riastradh> Um, ack.  I don't remember when he asks 'who is number one?' again and when he says 'what do you want?'!
15:04:07 * Riastradh is shamed.
15:04:11 <ibid> heh
15:04:20 <ibid> i wasn't following the script exactly
15:04:27 <ibid> i just wanted someone to say:
15:04:33 <ibid> i am not a number, i am a free man!
15:04:40 <ibid> :)
15:04:46 <ibid> (HAHHHAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)
15:05:37 <Riastradh> I am not a Church numeral; I am a free variable!
15:06:06 <norpan> a raving lunatic more like it
15:06:18 * Lemmih just lost 2 days of code because his hd crashed /-:
15:06:26 <ibid> who is Succ Zero?
15:06:29 <Riastradh> No, that was evil laughter from number two, norpan.
15:06:30 <norpan> only 2 days
15:06:49 <Lemmih> norpan: It's still annoying.
15:07:30 <ibid> Lemmih: you didn't upload it to an ftp site like real coderz before you crashed it? :)
15:19:30 <ibid> i'm sorry, that was mean
15:44:00 <Marvin--> "can you get us closer to the mines?"
15:50:49 <ibid> "explain like you would to a child"
16:07:06 <Marvin--> best. scifi parody. ever.
16:10:02 <ibid> joo
16:10:22 <ibid> well, spaceballs is a close contender :)
16:10:36 <Marvin--> that's true
16:11:27 <ibid> what was it, the giant cleaning maid? :)
16:11:34 <Marvin--> mega-maid
16:11:45 <Marvin--> "She's gone from suck to blow!"
16:11:49 <bizarreUser> :)
16:12:10 <ibid> :)
16:12:35 <ibid> blazing saddles is fun too, but that's in the wrong genre :)
16:12:57 <bizarreUser> Mel brooks made some clasics
16:13:10 <ibid> yeah
16:13:12 <bizarreUser> Young Frankenstein was his best imo
16:13:18 <Marvin--> actually, of his movies, Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles were the only ones I really enjoyed
16:13:33 <ibid> i enjoyed most of what i've seen from him
16:14:09 <ibid> in adition to spaceballs and blazing saddles, at least the producers was fun
16:15:24 <ibid> now, decisions, decisions...
16:16:01 <ibid> rewatch gåte season 3, rewatch star trek twok or go to bed...
16:17:36 <Marvin--> heh
16:18:01 <ibid> i watched season 7 finale just now for the first time
16:18:03 <ibid> (gåte)
16:22:16 <Cale> that's an awesome episode
16:22:20 <ibid> yeah
16:22:21 <Cale> (s)
16:22:31 <ibid> national television here is showing season 5
16:28:11 <Igloo> Grr, can I find out why ghc thinks my code is looping without compiling with -prof?
22:23:51 <Gahhh> why does haskell give me no error when I type "data Point = Int Float" when I mean "data Point = P Int Float" ?
22:24:30 <Riastradh> There's nothing wrong with it.
22:24:49 <Riastradh> Except PEBCAK, but I don't think any existing Haskell implementation can detect that sort of thing.
22:25:34 <Gahhh> The fact that you can use an existing type name like Int as a constructor is weird
22:25:35 <Riastradh> Types and constructors don't share a namespace, so you're perfectly free to have the same name living happily in both namespaces at once.
