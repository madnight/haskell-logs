02:48:01 * TheHunter fights with modutils
02:54:59 <TheHunter> yay! the forth nic seems to work.
03:56:31 <wolfman8k> would an old pentium work well as a fileserver with a 160 GB ide hard drive?
03:56:59 <tintin> wolfman8k: that depends not the bios
03:57:25 <tintin> can it handle a 160gb hdd ... ?
03:57:40 <wolfman8k> i dunno, but if not then i can hook the 160 up as a slave, right?
03:58:33 <tintin> no 
03:58:44 <tintin> it wont even recognise the drive
03:59:02 <tintin> u gotta check with your MB manufacturer
03:59:10 <wolfman8k> it's a 15 year old mb
03:59:23 <tintin> forget it
03:59:38 <tintin> my money is on it not handling the hdd 
03:59:58 <sam_> how old are pentiums?
04:00:21 <tintin> 8 years i would imagine
04:00:40 <tintin> maybe 10 not more 
04:00:50 <sam_> and you can put one in a 15 year old motherboard?
04:00:57 <tintin> 1995 was pentium 1
04:01:25 <sam_> about the same as powerpc macs then 
04:02:06 * sam_ is surprised
04:02:54 <sam_> about the motherboard thing hehe
04:03:01 <wolfman8k> my mb is probably from 1995 then :)
04:03:11 <wolfman8k> but it feels like it was earlier then that
04:04:15 <sam_> yea I always suprised to see a movie I thought was relatively recent is in fact a decade old whereas a computer model I think of is ancient is much less :)
04:07:06 <wolfman8k> so there's no chance that a 160 hard drive will work in this pc?
04:07:19 <tintin> i dont think so 
04:07:46 <sam_> if it was a mac I'd say it would, but I know little of pcs
04:08:13 <mflux> 128G of it might work
04:08:23 <mflux> (well not 128G infact, but somewhere around 120G I think)
04:08:33 <mflux> but it won't boot from it
04:09:02 <tintin> i am not sure anything above 8gb would work
04:09:47 <mflux> if it has a pci-bus, you could buy a new ide-controller, with bios, for it
04:11:38 <tintin> or cut all that down and get an old amd k6-3 or something
05:03:15 <shapr> Mmm, christmas dinner is almost done. I requested a christmas pizza this year.
05:03:27 <dblhelix> :)
05:03:47 <dblhelix> for me, it's one dinner down, one to go
05:03:53 <wli> 3 dinners in one day?
05:04:14 <dblhelix> two in two days
05:04:42 <wli> well, there were 3 huge earthquakes in one day, so it stood to reason
05:04:46 <sam_> It's the 27th already man
05:05:24 <dblhelix> sam_: well, in your timezone, it is; for me, it's 2pm on the 26th :)
05:05:29 <shapr> I enjoyed making a tree out of parsely and decorating it with red bell peppers (red paprika to europeans), purple onions, white cheese (snow of course), tan mushrooms, and tan tuna fish. I like edible cartoonish christmas trees.
05:06:24 <shapr> oh, and salami for the tree stand and the wooden floor.
05:06:25 <dblhelix> shapr: i would have expected that the guys here would be constructing a tree by parsing a stream of lexemes :)
05:06:52 <sam_> what about the ornament for the very top?
05:07:46 <shapr> I couldn't find anything really special for the top, so I made an angel with a pretty circular slice of purple onion, and red paprika bits for wings and green olive bits for the shirt
05:08:03 <sam_> :)
05:08:26 <shapr> It smells wonderful, only ten minutes more!
05:09:15 <shapr> dblhelix: it's christmas dinner for my fiancee and me, she's not so interested in parsing and lexemes. She does enjoy cooking though.
05:12:22 <dblhelix> shapr: fair enough
05:14:26 <dblhelix> yesterday I tried to explain my gf why lambda calculus is way more cool than turing machines; not exactly her idea of a xmas story, though
05:14:44 <sam_> paprika = bell pepper = capsicum?
05:18:38 * sam_ can't understand why clusy turing machines are still so often used as an explanatory device
05:18:44 <sam_> clusy = clumsy
05:24:16 <sam_> 'Frying paprika powder in hot oil is therefore critical and must last no longer than a few seconds.' ah oops :)
05:45:44 <bourbaki> moin
05:46:00 <bourbaki> TheHunter: hidiho
05:48:07 <TheHunter> moin bourbaki 
05:48:24 <TheHunter> i solved my modutils problem
05:48:53 <bourbaki> :)
05:49:24 <bourbaki> TheHunter: i have had a look into my algebraic topology book for my prob and found anything i needed
05:50:23 <TheHunter> cool
05:51:49 <bourbaki> TheHunter:  theres a <= defined on the simplices and thus i have the lattice for the mesh :)
06:19:29 <bourbaki> does anyone know if theres an implementation of some lisp in haskell?
06:19:44 <Lemmih> bourbaki: Search for HScheme.
06:19:55 <bourbaki> kk thanks
06:50:40 <Philippa> afternoon
06:51:06 <dblhelix> afternoon
06:51:12 <dblhelix> enjoying xmas?
06:51:43 <bourbaki> heh
06:52:21 <Philippa> 'sbeen OK I guess. Looking forward to heading home again on the 28th though
06:52:48 <dblhelix> where have you been celebrating then?
06:53:43 <Philippa> I'm with my parents. My boyfriend's with his, for that matter
06:54:18 <dblhelix> understanding the looking forward part now
07:43:16 <sam_> MegaMonad, did you have a merry christmas?
07:43:22 <MegaMonad> sam_: Want me to have a merry christmas?
07:44:02 <sam_> MegaMonad, yes I want you to have a merry christmas
07:44:07 <MegaMonad> sam_: If a have an array you allocate, then blow it for christmas.
07:45:05 <sam_> MegaMonad: don't worry I won't allocate any arrays
07:45:11 <MegaMonad> sam_: Actually, won't the type of the states of the parallel arrays is that the _end_result_ does not allocate a new way of writing such a section,retraction -pair (s,r.
08:04:12 <lyceen> hello everybody
08:05:24 <Lemmih> Hello lyceen 
08:05:41 <lyceen> Lots of people here lol.
08:06:27 <sam_> some of us are just unfriendly
08:07:09 <lyceen> what do you mean by "unfriendly"?
08:07:17 <lyceen> unwilling to answer?
08:08:09 <Riastradh> Watch out for MegaMonad.  He's the really scary one here.
08:08:20 <lyceen> Ok
08:08:22 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, be nice to lyceen!
08:08:29 <lyceen> Thanks for the good advice!
08:08:31 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Stepcut: i was about to add something that's nice to lyceen!
08:08:55 <lyceen> The haskell community is so much better than C++'s one lol
08:09:49 <sam_> I mean nothing by what I say, MM is lying!
08:09:52 <lyceen> What do you guys think about Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming
08:09:52 <Riastradh> That's because we, in general, tend to be more intelligent.  (Otherwise we'd be using C++!)
08:10:00 <lyceen> Lol
08:10:00 <Philippa> that, and we're smaller
08:10:10 <Philippa> less room for the arrogant-but-ignorant
08:10:21 <lyceen> that way I see
08:11:23 <lyceen> Well I just started learning Haskell last Wednesday
08:11:29 <lyceen> so i'm a complete noob lol
08:13:30 <Philippa> could be worse, my dad's not been trying for that long
08:13:41 <lyceen> hehe
08:13:52 <lyceen> are there people from Western-Europe around here?
08:14:20 <Riastradh> Yes, lots.
08:14:27 <lyceen> I'm from belgium
08:14:41 <wolfman8k> "Motto: avoid success at all costs", Simon Peyton Jones, Microsoft Research, Cambridge
08:14:59 <wolfman8k> MegaMonad: what is your motto?
08:15:05 <MegaMonad> wolfman8k: Hey, the libraries don't export the ones writing the df is that my file is now infra.assoc was conflicting with the topic on my hard drive (3 gb are an idiot" as your motto.
08:16:23 <lyceen> What a nice one
08:16:55 <sam_> I'm considering purchasing 'the Algebra of Programming', noone has found it disappointing?
08:17:35 * sam_ has very limited funds
08:17:51 <lyceen> Well, I"m considering buying Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming
08:18:39 <bourbaki> is there an intersection on lists?
08:19:20 <lyceen> yeah
08:19:28 <lyceen> http://www.hcw.be/hcwcs/p.asp?mscssid=&p=F6913&d=L#ld
08:19:37 <lyceen> that's the description and a table of contents
08:19:57 <bourbaki> thx
08:20:20 <lyceen> np
08:21:03 <wolfman8k> MegaMonad: rtfm
08:21:09 <MegaMonad> wolfman8k: I just don't keep money *on* the account, i should try representing a single rtfm answer yet..
08:21:16 <Lemmih> lyceen: It's a pretty good book IMHO.
08:21:31 <sam_> I found 'the craft' good for initial learning, we used it for our declaritive languages paper, but I would have prefered a book that was better able to double as a reference
08:22:19 <lyceen> Well currently I just need a good book to learn it ^-^
08:23:24 <sam_> I can't say I've properly read any others to compare it with though
08:23:50 <lyceen> Well, if you've succesfully learned it, that's a good thing ;)
08:29:25 <tintin> the tutorials online need a bit of an upgrade 
08:29:48 <tintin> they dont seem to be good enough most of them anyways ... they just dont cover enough in a lot of cases 
08:30:40 <Lemmih> tintin: How so?
08:31:34 * Lemmih is very fond of online tutorials and papers.
08:32:12 <tintin> Lemmih: i dont blame them but they are nowhere as good as the craft or other books 
08:33:09 <lyceen> I also prefer books :)
08:33:43 <lyceen> It's better for my eyes lol
08:35:08 <tintin> on the flipside of things Haskell programming books tend to be insanely expensive 
08:36:35 <lyceen> Well yeah I currently have sufficient funds (christmas..)
08:38:13 <autrijus> greetings.
08:39:56 <Lemmih> Hello autrijus.
08:40:15 * Lemmih curses GHC's linking order.
08:40:54 <lyceen> Heh now I understand why MegaMonad is "mean" lol
08:42:30 <sam_> has anyone read 'the Algebra of Programming'?
08:42:38 <lyceen> Not me sorry
08:43:56 <autrijus> I'm running into a problem with the embedded Hugs server api.  Is it a way to "cast" the HVal on top of the stack into a String?  I tried pushing lookupName("Prelude", "show") on stack, but that gave me a dynamic type error.
08:44:00 <sam_> MegaMonad, what is your opinion on 'the algebra of programming'?
08:44:07 <MegaMonad> sam_: My linear algebra and analysis and now i have to get programming in my do constructions.
08:45:36 <lyceen> sam_: Hope that's an answer to your question ;)
08:47:40 <wli> I have "The Algebra of Programming"
08:47:42 <wli> hang on
08:47:50 <wli> let me get the thing out
08:48:21 <wli> Okay, what's the question?
08:49:07 <lyceen> Well, what's your opinion on it 
08:49:23 <wli> I'm trying to remember anything specific about it.
08:49:31 <wli> Okay, I remember now.
08:49:52 <wli> I wish it had had more detailed examples of how to carry out program transformations.
08:50:00 <wli> e.g. programmatically
08:50:17 <sam_> I wan't to grok e.g. ana + cata = hylomorphism, will I by reading it?
08:50:38 <wli> probably not
08:51:51 <lyceen> wb LrdMtrod
08:51:54 <wli> sorry, it should actually
08:55:19 <sam_> If I be emnarassingly honest, I hoped someone would say 'that book is great, you gotta get it' so I could use up some of my limited funds buying it :)
08:56:42 <lyceen> Well.. i never read it lol
08:57:14 <LrdMtrod> lyceen: well, connection from Japan is somewhat unstable...
08:57:22 <tintin> sam_: tryed the paul Mudock one ?
08:57:36 <LrdMtrod> gotta go try talking to my family now!
08:57:46 <sam_> no, I haven't heard of it
08:59:34 <sam_> googling gets me nothing
08:59:47 <tintin> www.haskell.org
08:59:50 <tintin> and books there
09:00:25 <tintin> haskell school of expressions
09:01:24 <tintin> its the one i plan to take up after i am through all the basic material available. shapr seems to think this one is good or i heard him mention it some time or the other 
09:01:24 <sam_> oh Hudack
09:01:42 <tintin> sorry wrong spelling :D
09:03:25 <sam_> Great idea for a book, everyone loves pretty pictures and such :)
09:03:55 <sam_> Hudack writes nice papers too
09:04:38 <sam_> oops wrong spelling :D
09:05:38 <tintin> paul Hudak 
09:08:02 <sam_> From the description, If I were Lyceen I'd get that one
09:09:35 <sam_> wli, no general impression on the quality of explanation?
09:10:34 <goron> Is there anyone with some knowledge regarding markpointers and stackpointers? 
09:11:26 <sam_> Hudak's book is in the library, I am looking forward to getting it out, cheers tintin
09:12:54 <Riastradh> goron, you might want to elaborate on your question a little.
09:13:18 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, sprichst du deutsch?
09:13:23 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: Or even a du.
09:13:36 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, tu parle fracais?
09:13:41 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: Quelle dommage, je ne parle beacoup de francais, mais je comprends plus que je parle.
09:15:03 <tuomov> MegaMonad: puhutko viel√§k√§√§n suomea?
09:15:09 <Janni> Hi
09:15:09 <MegaMonad> tuomov: I think programmers should use the latter or simply map the nodes so its not in the k be a problem in ghc's cvs (there will definitely hack up a new n.
09:15:20 <Lemmih> Hello Janni 
09:15:45 <ibid> tuomov: ei tarpeeksi materiaalia. pit‰nee korjata tuo puute :)
09:15:57 <lyceen> I speak english, german french and dutch lol
09:16:15 <ibid> what's this language "lol"? never heard
09:16:22 <tuomov> ei ole oikein oppinut, vaikka kyll√§ "suomea" on esiintynyt aika usein
09:16:28 <goron> Riastradh: Ok, well I thought that the markpointer and stackpointer pointed to address 0 at the start of the program. But in an implementation of a hypothetical machine, it's not.  
09:16:33 <ibid> ei tarpeeksi
09:16:41 <lyceen> And a bit of haskell ;)
09:17:19 <goron> Riastradh: The MP points to one address lower than the SP. 
09:17:27 <Lemmih> ibid: It's from the strange land of counter-strike players and noobs.
09:17:42 <ibid> Lemmih: figures
09:18:22 <ibid> are there different dialects, english lol, german lol, and perhaps ... dutch lol?
09:18:26 <Lemmih> I think it means 'end statement' or ';' from C.
09:18:31 <ibid> heh
09:19:07 <lyceen> Well, i have to learn them in school
09:19:18 <Riastradh> goron, first you could perhaps elaborate on what you mean by 'markpointer' & 'stackpointer,' because they could easily have a great number of meanings.
09:19:19 <lyceen> In belgium people speak three different languages
09:19:52 <ibid> Lemmih: in finland, everybody's forced to study three languages at school
09:20:09 <lyceen> Well, english is mandatory as well here ;)
09:20:09 <ibid> bah
09:20:14 <ibid> lyceen: in finland, everybody's forced to study three languages at school
09:20:15 <ibid> :)
09:20:25 <ibid> lyceen: two of them are domestic enough
09:20:36 <ibid> (finnish and swedish)
09:20:48 <lyceen> It's a dream for me, just 2 languages :p
09:21:03 <goron> Riastradh: Got to eat. Back in x minutes. 
09:21:32 <ibid> lyceen: i suspect your three languages are closer to each other than my two :)
09:22:02 <lyceen> Unfortunately not :)
09:22:09 <lyceen> german and dutch are close to each other
09:22:19 <lyceen> but french isn't
09:22:34 <ibid> those three are closer to each other than swedish and finnish
09:22:42 <bourbaki> moin
09:22:44 <tuomov> french is still close to german compared to finnish vs. the rest of the european languages minus estonian
09:22:53 <bourbaki> quick question can i have abstract classes?
09:22:57 <lyceen> close to german?
09:22:58 <lyceen> lol
09:23:08 <ibid> lyceen: not at all lol
09:23:10 <maeglin> tuomov, well, estonian is actually VERY close to finish
09:23:20 <tuomov> MegaMonad: yep
09:23:21 <lyceen> maybe there are some common words
09:23:25 <ibid> lyceen: all your three languages belong to the same family
09:23:28 <bourbaki> all european languages are similar
09:23:30 <MegaMonad> tuomov: Yep, that's a kind of morphology flashcards?
09:23:31 <lyceen> nope
09:23:36 <bourbaki> sure
09:23:36 <ibid> bourbaki: not all, most
09:23:37 <lyceen> there are roman and german languages
09:23:43 <tuomov> it's funny to read estonian, you understand half of it without studying it at all, but sometimes the same words mean very different things
09:23:46 <bourbaki> there are a lot of words in all the languages shared
09:23:51 <ibid> lyceen: yes, but they are both indoeuropean
09:23:57 <lyceen> like dutch english and french are german
09:24:00 <bourbaki> and all european languages are head driven
09:24:02 <ibid> lyceen: swedish is, too, but not finnish
09:24:14 <bourbaki> finnish is not a european language
09:24:17 <lyceen> french, spanish, italian is roman
09:24:25 <bourbaki> or swedish i just cant remember
09:24:27 <ibid> bourbaki: i'll take exception to that :)
09:24:32 <bourbaki> one of them is close to turkish
09:24:35 <tuomov> finnish, estonian and hungarian are finno-ugric languages and they are far removed from the rest of the european language that are in the indo-european family
09:24:42 <ibid> bourbaki: if you'd said *indo*european, you'd be correct
09:24:50 <bourbaki> anyway i need a hand here
09:25:03 <tuomov> but hungarian is quite different from finnish/estonian already
09:25:04 <ibid> bourbaki: the relation between turkish and finnish is a myth
09:25:11 * esap likes to think about computer languages instead of spoken languages, they're much easier to analyze and understand.
09:25:28 <bourbaki> i have a class Foobar where top :: foobar now i want to have different top elements in that thingy dependant on the instance
09:26:01 <bourbaki> that is i have a specific mesh and the top element is the mesh itself so i dont want to make an instance just for a mesh is that possible?
09:26:05 <esap> bourbaki: in that example, you don't have any instances.
09:26:21 <bourbaki> esap: sec ill post the code that i have
09:26:29 <lyceen> can you have classes in haskell?
09:26:54 <esap> lyceen: depends on your definition of 'class'. There is a concept called 'class' in Haskell.
09:27:02 <bourbaki> http://nopaste.php-q.net/104351
09:27:51 <lyceen> is it like C++?
09:28:04 <bourbaki> my prob is that the class Topology has a top element from the Lattice and this top element is dependant on the mesh or what ever topology i use so i would have to have an instance for any mesh i have and that bothers me a bit
09:28:05 <esap> lyceen: no, not really.
09:28:13 <lyceen> ow ok
09:28:54 <lyceen> does anyone knows what CPS is?
09:29:04 <ibid> lyceen: sure
09:29:12 <ibid> lyceen: continuation-passing style
09:29:23 <lyceen> yeah but can you try to explain me in a PM?
09:29:29 <ibid> PM?
09:29:33 <maeglin> he means query
09:29:36 <ibid> heh
09:29:37 <bourbaki> esap: do you know what i mean with my problem description?
09:29:43 <TheHunter> @wiki ContinuationPassingStyle
09:29:44 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ContinuationPassingStyle
09:29:47 <lyceen> yeah query whatever :p
09:29:50 <ibid> MegaMonad: what's continuation-passing style?
09:30:00 <lyceen> i've read that
09:30:01 <esap> bourbaki: Yes, I'm thinking about the connection between the mesh and the top element. Why do you need the connection?
09:30:03 <bourbaki> TheHunter: do you see the problem as well?
09:30:11 <MegaMonad> ibid: We've already got their style of programming style, but they seem to be passing way to do with all the text from the type checker to resolve some ambiguity.
09:30:17 <bourbaki> esap: i define the mesh as a topology
09:30:33 <bourbaki> esap: then the lattice is needed to get the join and the meet
09:31:01 <bourbaki> esap: and then in a topology there are the emptyset and the overall space included in the topology that is top and buttom
09:31:18 <esap> bourbaki: so you should have a function 'top_element :: Mesh a -> a' or something like that?
09:31:19 <bourbaki> and the top element is dependant of the mesh i use
09:31:35 <bourbaki> esap: the mesh is defined as a topology of MeshElements
09:32:10 <bourbaki> so my instance MeshElements would be an instance of a single Mesh
09:32:16 <bourbaki> ie a unit sphere
09:32:46 <bourbaki> so i can just make one instance of a mesh
09:34:08 <esap> bourbaki: Maybe the model of Lattice and Topology are not very good, e.g. it doesn't allow all interesting properties of those concepts.
09:34:33 <bourbaki> esap: why?
09:35:23 <esap> bourbaki: Well if you would need to have multiple instances of Lattice for the same type, then you might think the type class is not a correct way to model it.
09:35:28 <bourbaki> esap: a topology just consists of a join and meet and a subset of sets of the actual thingy the problem is that its not a type i want a topology over but a set
09:35:47 <bourbaki> right
09:36:12 <bourbaki> is there a way to get around this? maybe i just think not haskellish enough here but too mathematically
09:38:20 <bourbaki> or am i missing a major point here?
09:39:58 <esap> bourbaki: I'm thinking you need to find a strict correspondence between the concepts you write in Haskell and the concepts you want to model. I mean, if you want to represent lattices and topologies, then you should be able to construct the whole concept. What I can see, it seems that you want to represent a topology as a [[a]], which seems pretty strange to me.
09:41:12 <bourbaki> esap: im going stricly for the definition
09:41:13 <bourbaki> http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/TopologicalSpace.html
09:41:55 <bourbaki> A topological space is a set X  together with a set T whose elements are subsets of X such that ...
09:42:06 <bourbaki> 0 /in T, X /in T
09:42:16 <bourbaki> these two are the same as in the lattice top and buttom
09:42:22 <TheHunter> bourbaki, what about glue and nbd? I have no idea what they should do.
09:42:29 <bourbaki> and then that the meet and the join is included
09:42:39 <bourbaki> glue is just
09:42:45 <bourbaki> X  + Y \ ~
09:43:11 <bourbaki> the sum of two meshes and then an equiv fn ~ that tells you which elements are the same
09:43:25 <bourbaki> i need that for my programming stuff as well
09:43:52 <bourbaki> i just want to do the very basics for 3d meshes and my programs ie in the latter case pathfinding on topologies
09:43:55 <esap> bourbaki: ok, from that definition, you would first need to build sets and subsets.
09:44:17 <esap> bourbaki: Which are already pretty difficult.
09:44:19 <bourbaki> esap: set is [] subset set is [[]]
09:44:35 <bourbaki> and i use join and meet of the lattice for n and u
09:45:08 <esap> bourbaki: not really, those are finite linearly ordered lists.
09:45:26 <goron> Riastradh: This is the machine: http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/atze/SSM/download.html It also has documentation online (on the "machine" page, the registers are explained). 
09:45:33 <esap> bourbaki: or infinite lists
09:45:46 <esap> bourbaki: But it's not strictly the same as a set.
09:46:13 <sam_> probably unhelpful but the book 'computational category theory' is a good example of defining a mathematical concept in a functional programming language, in this case ml (I think)
09:46:15 <esap> bourbaki: of course, you may only need some parts of the definition of a set.
09:46:30 <bourbaki> esap: that totally depends on the space the topology is defined on
09:46:45 <TheHunter> i don't see how the concept of a lattice is helpful here, since every powerset ordered by inclusion forms a (complete) lattice.
09:48:02 <bourbaki> esap: but you see the problem in the end dont you?
09:48:06 <TheHunter> bourbaki, the way you wrote glue, it maps to elements of your topological space to another one, which seems pretty different from what you described.
09:48:20 <bourbaki> TheHunter: i use the meet and join of the lattice
09:48:51 <bourbaki> TheHunter: it is the sum of two spaces and them you take the quotient space with respect to the ~ fn
09:48:57 <TheHunter> but they're just union and intersection.
09:49:10 <bourbaki> this i use to build complex programs or meshes 
09:49:35 <bourbaki> but thats all you need in order to have a Toplogy with respect to the def i just posted
09:50:53 <TheHunter> shouldn't be glue have a type like (Topology a, Topology b) => a -> b -> (a -> b -> Bool) -> (exists c. Topology c => c).
09:51:37 <bourbaki> if theres a sum for different topologies
09:52:01 <bourbaki> but you are right there the gule i defined is not good
09:52:01 <esap> bourbaki: I think I see the problem. I'm not sure exactly how to solve it though. I think you need to look more closely into how the concepts from mathematics map to Haskell concepts.
09:52:30 * esap is not quite sure what glue is intended to do.
09:52:48 <bourbaki> esap: my idea is that you can glue graphs that way
09:53:03 <bourbaki> ie in automaton theory you can concaternate automatons
09:53:33 <esap> but I think your glue operation operates on the points, not on graphs. Hmm..
09:53:46 <bourbaki> yes
09:53:54 <bourbaki> its not propperly defined
09:54:07 <bourbaki> actually glue has to be a class also
09:56:59 <bourbaki> well that needs some more work there but the main problem still remains
09:58:02 <bourbaki> esap: are you willing to think some more on how to solve the prob i have to go now
09:58:06 <TheHunter> you should probably choose a more concrete representation of your problem than the one using type classes.
09:59:20 <esap> I'm wondering if you should use a '* -> *' kind for specific topologies. Such that the argument would be the type of the points.
10:00:54 <bourbaki> esap: i have a <=
10:01:42 <sam_> is haskells typing as rich as MLs?
10:01:51 <esap> class Topology f where { topology :: f a -> [[a]] ; neighbourhood :: f a -> a -> [a] } something along those lines.
10:04:28 <bourbaki> where f is of what kind?
10:04:36 <esap> bourbaki: * -> *.
10:06:29 <TheHunter> sam_, haskell has type classes, ghc higher-rank polymorphism, I guess that qualifies as "richer" than ML's typing.
10:06:41 <esap> bourbaki: that's probably not good either. Needs some work.
10:07:03 <esap> bourbaki: you need to represent the open sets of a topology as well.
10:08:05 <sam_> if I can do it in MLs type system => I can do it in Haskell's
10:08:10 <sam_> ?
10:09:23 <esap> bourbaki: think of simple cases, set X = Bool in the definition of a topological space. Then T is a subset of { 0, {True}, {False}, {True, False}}. 
10:09:53 <TheHunter> sam_, you'd have to encode ml functors (what an inappropriate name!) into existentials, but i don't know ml enough to give a definite answer.
10:10:13 <sam_> thanks
10:10:40 <esap> bourbaki: and you must have that 0 \in T and {True,False} \in T.
10:10:58 <bourbaki> esap: thats in lattice already
10:15:20 * esap is now wondering about representation for sets. Maybe it should be 'a -> Bool'.
10:16:07 <sam_> what else?
10:18:59 <bourbaki> esap: what kind of representation would that be?
10:20:03 <esap> bourbaki: well the only thing you could do to a set would be you could ask whether some value was element of the set or not.
10:20:19 <esap> bourbaki: which would map to function application.
10:20:30 <esap> bourbaki: Then the other operations would be mapped to manipulation of functions.
10:20:33 <sam_> the CCT book in online btw
10:21:50 <esap> bourbaki: you could do union of two sets with (a -> Bool) -> (b -> Bool) -> Either a b -> Bool
10:25:33 <esap> bourbaki: and intersection using class Intersection a b c | c -> a, c -> b where { intersect :: (a -> Bool) -> (b -> Bool) -> c -> Bool } [I think, something close to that at least]
10:27:11 <esap> bourbaki: Representation of sets is not a simple thing to make work correctly.
10:27:47 <sam_> you probably don't need the full generality of sets
10:28:20 <esap> true
10:29:09 <esap> on the other hand, if you don't have good correspondence with the actual concept, you have to be careful not to break anything due to the differences.
10:30:19 <sam_> true, but homogoneity often filters up nicely
10:30:23 * esap worries about that a lot, because I rely a lot on the type checking to do the right thing.
10:30:55 <bourbaki> hm dang thats a pitty that you cant do that with haskell the way i think about it
10:34:52 <esap> bourbaki: Your approach is not that far from working. I think the only thing is how to distinguish different topologies of the same points.
10:35:26 <bourbaki> right
10:35:45 <sam_> I don't think I have ever needed heterogenous sets, and if I did I would probably just 'wrap' the types
10:36:06 <bourbaki> id like to use that for graphs as well
10:37:02 <esap> bourbaki: the thing is, you need some data to identify a topology. A class doesn't do that.
10:37:23 <esap> bourbaki: But then the problem comes that it's not clear what should be the type of that data.
10:37:42 <bourbaki> right
10:38:05 <esap> bourbaki: the properties of a topology can then be associated with that type, once you find what that is.
10:38:17 <bourbaki> and how i tie the class thingy to the data cause there are things needed in the class that come from the data
10:38:18 <esap> bourbaki: or parts of that type.
10:39:06 <esap> bourbaki: well your topology class currently relates to only the points. I think that's not correct, maybe it should be more like a relationship between the topology and the points.
10:39:06 <bourbaki> esap: could you try to write a small sample thing?
10:39:40 <bourbaki> esap: that thing was a new class then like class Glue ... class Add and such
10:40:33 <esap> bourbaki: I'm thinking of class Topology f a where { ... }, where 'f' would be the topology and 'a' would be the type of the points.
10:40:52 <esap> bourbaki: But what kind of type is good for 'f' is not currently clear.
10:41:17 <bourbaki> how can i make a specific mesh with that f?
10:42:52 <esap> bourbaki: well maybe it's something like type SpecificMesh = MeshTopologyOn Point3D. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.
10:43:57 <bourbaki> well i wanted to implement the mesh with charts
10:44:05 <esap> charts?
10:44:15 <bourbaki> that is that i map a graph to a 3d space
10:44:37 <bourbaki> charts are functions that map subsets of a manifold to |R^3 ie
10:45:32 <esap> ok. Anyway, this is getting pretty complex as a whole.
10:46:37 <bourbaki> yes i wanted to be as close as possible to the mathematical definition cause it makes things really easy and cool
10:47:19 <esap> and often inefficient :-)
10:48:29 * esap thinks about mathematical definition of real numbers, and contemplates its implementation with Haskell.
10:49:08 <afk> which definition ?
10:49:15 <afk> dedekind ?
10:49:19 <esap> afk: yes.
10:49:36 <esap> afk: or even the constructive reals.
10:52:02 <esap> I suppose you need to build lattices etc. before you can even think about doing that.
10:53:10 <sam_> I believe reals have been defined in lambda calc, something to do with returning succesively closer approximations
10:54:09 <esap> yea, it's not that hard [assuming you have rational numbers].
10:54:54 <vincenz> sam_: where do I get the CCT book
10:57:35 <Spark> someone was studying that at uni
10:59:00 <sam_> http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/
10:59:27 <vincenz> thnx
11:01:36 <vincenz> server can't be found
11:01:56 <sam_> hmm
11:02:54 <musasabi> (does not work from here either)
11:05:31 <Lemmih> Phew.. finally done.
11:05:40 <Lemmih> Time to unicycle!
11:06:15 <tic> shapr convinced you? :)
11:06:19 <vincenz> v
11:06:22 <vincenz> hmm
11:06:23 <tic> err, got you into it.
11:06:33 <Lemmih> tic: Bah. I was unicycling long before shapr.
11:06:36 <ski> http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/
11:06:39 <tic> Lemmih, eep. sorry then. ,)
11:06:42 <ski> um
11:06:45 <Lemmih> (-:
11:06:46 <vincenz> nope
11:06:55 * ski actually thought he did /away afk some time ago, but must have done /nick afk
11:06:56 <vincenz> site doesn't work, not even the main site
11:06:58 <sam_> I found the link from which I dled it, from someones collection of links to online cat theory texts, I'm trying to remeber who
11:07:00 <vincenz> yet if you ping it, it finds it
11:07:28 <sam_> must be temp then
11:09:16 <vincenz> be nice if you had the page linking to it
11:12:08 <sam_> here the page from which I found the link, unfortunately its the same link: http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/~akurz/ct.html
11:13:07 <vincenz> thx
11:13:33 <sam_> to the actual file http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.ps If www.cs.man.ac.uk doesn't work it must be temporary
11:15:46 <sam_> btw, this is a cool site for online texts: http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/franka/ref
11:38:06 <sam_> cya
11:52:57 <lyceen> hello
11:53:02 <Lemmih> Welcome back lyceen.
11:55:15 <lyceen> how are you?
11:55:33 <Lemmih> Great. Just returned from a unicycling trip.
11:57:18 <lyceen> lol
11:58:27 <Lemmih> And I made a successful test run of Hacanon.
11:59:02 <lyceen> Could Haskell be used for software that controls a nuclear reactor?
12:00:36 <maeglin> lol
12:01:18 <lyceen> It's just a question ^-^
12:01:21 <Lemmih> lyceen: Sure.
12:02:00 <shapr> Right, I learned from Lemmih.
12:02:26 <Lemmih> shapr: You learned how to control a nuclear reactor from me?
12:02:35 <ski> lyceen : you want to control a nuclear reactor ?
12:02:41 <shapr> autrijus: greetings!
12:02:49 <shapr> Lemmih: actually no, I learned that in class.
12:02:50 <Lemmih> shapr: Hey shapr.
12:02:55 <lyceen> Sure, I want to control a nuclear reactor
12:02:59 <lyceen> Why not?
12:03:10 <lyceen> But it's a bit buggy in C++
12:03:14 <ski> yeah, badaboom, funfunfun
12:03:15 <lyceen> Deadly radiaton and stuff
12:03:19 <shapr> I learn the thrills of unicycling from Lemmih.
12:03:26 <shapr> lyceen: it's not that bad really.
12:03:40 <Lemmih> shapr: I have many updates for Hacanon waiting to be sent.
12:03:46 <lyceen> Well, I've heard that Haskell has no side-effects.. ;)
12:03:55 <shapr> Usually you have a bunch of feet of shielding with a low atomic number first, and then a layer of lead after that.
12:03:59 <ski> lyceen : i guess in some aspects haskell would be far better than c++
12:04:14 <ski> lyceen : depends on how you see it :)
12:04:16 <shapr> Lemmih: sorry, I'll fix it after I've talked to my relatives for their holiday phone call.
12:04:45 <Lemmih> Great.
12:04:57 <tuomov> real-time constraints could be a problem, but otherwise I see it as a much better alternative
12:05:14 <lyceen> So...with Haskell I can control a reactor?
12:05:40 <tuomov> heh. reminds me of a disclaimer in an old rocks'n'diamonds (or what was the other game by that guy?) readme or somesuch..
12:05:42 <autrijus> hey shapr.
12:06:11 <Lemmih> lyceen: Haskell is a general purpose programming language... you can do everything.
12:06:30 <lyceen> So... I could even write software for a rollercoaster with it?
12:06:40 <Lemmih> Sure.
12:07:16 <lyceen> Waaw
12:07:22 <Lemmih> Might not be practical but it _is_ possible.
12:08:02 <lyceen> hello, swarm
12:08:19 <shapr> autrijus: are you learning Haskell?
12:08:52 <autrijus> shapr: yeah, been learning it for a month now
12:08:56 <shapr> neat
12:09:00 <autrijus> shapr: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Language-Haskell/
12:09:13 <autrijus> working on Inline::Haskell now.
12:09:17 <shapr> I'd love to hear your impressions of the language (when I return from family phone calls)
12:09:44 <autrijus> I think I'd like to code all my data abstractions and logic with it.
12:09:55 <autrijus> and leave the lower level code to CPAN ;)
12:11:54 <lyceen> are there belgians here?
12:14:14 * shapr tries to remember time offset to east coast USA
12:14:27 <shapr> seven hours back?
12:14:38 * shapr hopes so
12:14:45 <tuomov> could be
12:14:54 <tuomov> iirc .fi-toronto was around 9h
12:15:01 <maeglin> 6
12:15:05 <musasabi> morning
12:15:17 <maeglin> shapr, if you are in CET than new york is 6 hours behind
12:17:21 <tuomov> of course extra problems arise from different times to switching to daylight saving brain-damage mode
12:18:04 <tuomov> but those shouldn't be a problem at this time of year anymore
12:19:14 <lyceen> Isn't it possible to write a program that calculates timezones lol :p
12:19:15 <musasabi> Getting some of Alice's functionality into Haskell would be nice..
12:20:43 <tuomov> TZ=whatever date
13:03:28 <Aglarion> hi maeglin
13:28:19 <shapr> musasabi: what part of Alic?
13:34:37 * Boegel greets everyone in #haskell
13:34:55 <shapr> hoi
13:36:28 * ski asks Boegel to join our merry band
13:36:39 <Lemmih> shapr: How's darcs?
13:38:17 <maeglin> hey Aglarion 
13:38:32 * Boegel joins the merry band
13:39:08 <boegel> my stomache feels kinda weird
13:39:20 <boegel> a whole weekend of eating is NOT good for yourself
13:39:32 <mflux> nonsense
13:39:36 <mflux> you must've done it wrong
13:39:54 <boegel> mflux, i probably ate too much
13:40:02 <boegel> but it's sooooo yummy :p
13:42:05 <ski> <MegaMonad> I think that idea a while to stop being happy when you run across the same idea.
13:43:23 <ski> <ski> Have you met Simon Marlow ?
13:43:24 <ski> <MegaMonad> A nice thing about virtuals is that simon marlow is the best way to do atm is that simon actually wrote the first step to reified typeclasses.
13:44:45 <musasabi> shapr: any of the alice good sides.
13:45:32 <musasabi> shapr: "Futures: laziness and concurrency with data-flow synchronisation" "Higher-order modules: higher-order functors and abstract signatures" "Packages: integrating static with dynamic typing and first class modules" "Pickling: higher-order type-safe, generic & platform-independent persistence" "Components: platform-independence and type-safe dynamic loading of modules" "Distribution: type-safe cross-platform remote functions and network mobility" 
13:48:36 <ibid> boegel: you're just out of practice :)
13:49:38 <shapr> musasabi: that does sound tasty.
13:49:58 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, how much can you eat?
13:50:04 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: \Me really like python. Zope is more that i know i can eat with pie.
13:50:21 <shapr> MegaMonad: What sort of music do you like?
13:50:26 <MegaMonad> shapr: Or si it the same in c would have said it was possible to dump those files but it seems for me out of purchase. Taking into account the effects in functional programming i sort of music do you dislike it.
13:50:41 <autrijus> MegaMonad: perl, cpan, and everything?
13:50:41 <shapr> MegaMonad: confusion?
13:50:45 <boegel> ibid, it's like this every year
13:50:46 <MegaMonad> autrijus: Haskell mode has that haskell cpan.
13:50:52 <MegaMonad> shapr: Sorry, confusion on my viewer, to see what you're trying to figure out.
13:50:58 <ibid> boegel: you don't practice often enough :)
13:50:59 <boegel> we go eating, but I never can stop because it tastes so damn good
13:51:10 <musasabi> MegaMonad: Haskell cpan is cabal.
13:51:16 <MegaMonad> musasabi: So cabal would be straightforward to iterate over something like cpan?
13:51:26 <shapr> heh
13:51:29 <boegel> I even take stuff from other people plates, because they can't handle it (the quantity)
13:51:57 <mflux> boegel, or maybe they do know when to stop?-)
13:52:53 <shapr> um, how do I manually apply a patch in darcs?
13:53:17 <musasabi> manaually apply - as with patch(1) ?
13:53:57 <Lemmih> darcs apply [patchfile]?
13:55:40 <shapr> this is weird, darcs just hangs.
13:56:26 <boegel> mflux, probably
13:56:35 <Lemmih> Using 100% cpu?
13:57:00 <shapr> yup
13:57:04 <shapr> Lemmih: is that familiar?
13:57:08 <Lemmih> Yes.
13:57:13 <shapr> any clues what it's doing?
13:57:16 <Lemmih> Nope.
13:57:20 <shapr> :-/
13:57:33 <shapr> your repo works fine?
13:57:57 <Lemmih> I "fixed" it my removing the repo followed by 'darcs get'.
13:58:37 <shapr> maybe I can do a pull from you then?
13:59:17 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, oooo, i need a dirty woman, oooo, i need a dirty girl
13:59:22 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: A woman in the channel dirty.
13:59:40 <Lemmih> shapr: Sure. http://212.242.49.100/repo/haskell/cpp2hs
13:59:52 <ibid> MegaMonad: which channel?
13:59:56 <Lemmih> I guess I should file a bug report.
13:59:59 <MegaMonad> ibid: Probably mapping some function that adds one into the same channel he is on.
14:00:18 <ibid> MegaMonad: i'm sure that's very dirty :)
14:00:23 <MegaMonad> ibid: You could install it at some point to the variable is a bit dirty when you look in baes for stuff you're missing. If you're on the type in the type definitions up to a class?'  what change is mysql_store_result.
14:03:11 <shapr> Lemmih: I can't get it to pull at all.
14:03:16 * shapr tries get
14:05:26 <shapr> Lemmih: ok, I just did a get from you, can you push changes now?
14:06:31 <Lemmih> Where should I mail it?
14:06:42 <shapr> same address as before.
14:07:15 <Lemmih> And where's that? ('darcs get' cleared the address)
14:07:35 <shapr> hacanon@scannedinavian.com (or .org?)
14:07:42 <shapr> ah, .org
14:08:05 <Lemmih> Oki.
14:08:22 <Lemmih> Wheee. It's working again (-:
14:09:00 <Lemmih> Btw, hacanon is also working. You should check it out once I've made some test cases.
14:11:27 <shapr> ok, sounds cool
14:11:43 <shapr> there were some C++ libs I wanted to bind to, though I forget what at the moment.
14:12:38 <shapr> the haskellnehe repo sounds really interesting to me.
14:12:45 * Lemmih thinks of wxwidgets and clanlib.
14:12:50 <shapr> That's another thing I'd like to get around to learning.
14:17:01 <Lemmih> It would be great if you would continue the series. I only completed 6 lessons, I think.
14:22:09 <Lemmih> Fooie. 'Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.currentModule' is only available in >=6.3
14:26:16 <ibid> how evil am i if i make my compiler use tagged words?

14:28:42 <MegaMonad> ibid: Shapr: really? I thought that there will be tagged with the use of functional programming in a compiler too.
14:29:00 <ibid> MegaMonad: well, i am writing the compiler in haskell
14:29:05 <MegaMonad> ibid: Haskell that is one formulation of the compiler you use, and i could do a lot of different apis and stuff.
14:29:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: yeah, i eventually plan to write a production compiler in ketchup. this is just bootstrap
14:29:36 <MegaMonad> ibid: Bluejay: if it helps, but i plan that the only commonly-used monads that i write my own bootstrap.
14:29:51 <ibid> MegaMonad: i write most of my monads myself
14:29:57 <MegaMonad> ibid: Oh haha i write as i was looking at monads is the compilers smart enough to add yourself to a backup host for the uni next to you?
14:30:53 <ibid> MegaMonad: you know, i think you're asking about how good my compiler is but i'm not sure if i'n right. anyway, it's just a bootstrap compiler, i'm not making it dance to any fancy tunes
14:30:59 <MegaMonad> ibid: I'm right in the channel dance.
14:31:21 <ibid> MegaMonad: care to teach me the steps?
14:31:26 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes, i tried reading and ability to teach you how to do a lot of steps in the channel you know.
14:31:42 <ibid> MegaMonad: how about the channel i don't know?
14:31:48 <MegaMonad> ibid: And you can get you an example, you can think of the channel.
14:32:01 <cm> shapr >==< christmasPresents
14:32:13 <ibid> MegaMonad: i need an example to think of the channel?  what sort of an example?
14:32:18 <MegaMonad> ibid: The example i don't know what to do, say, ghci, we'd need linker-level stuff. But in practice, not everybody'll bother to make a good channel to say in template haskell would make you :-p.
14:32:45 <ibid> MegaMonad: huh? ghci is an example?
14:32:48 <Lemmih> MegaMonad: Why doesn't my wireless keyboard like r's?
14:32:50 <MegaMonad> ibid: Five minutes before outputting hello world example just try making this sort of monadst class to the ghci dynamic linker cuz it's faster than ghci that it does give a 5 if you want to have type folds.
14:32:56 <MegaMonad> Lemmih: Bourbaki: quotient spaces on these things. I just dislike to know what you have a wireless isp for my thesis... But when i'm able to have a keyboard the string with quotes | [-a-za-z0-9]* when it look like what you call "broken".
14:33:16 <ibid> my MegaMonad is good
14:33:21 <ibid> he always manages to confuse me :)
14:36:19 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, i have become comfortably numb
14:36:26 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: Tease me not, or they send you a little numb from a very strange thing to have to be able to ride around quite comfortably?
14:38:43 <shapr> cm: I got a unicycle for christmas.
14:38:50 <cm> :>
14:38:52 <cm> another one?
14:38:55 <cm> or your first?
14:39:27 <shapr> I got my second unicycle in August for an ahead-of-time Christmas present.
14:39:59 <shapr> I rode it on Christmas Day just to appreciate the christmas-ness of the occasion.
14:40:41 <shapr> cm: did you get cool stuff for christmasPresents?
14:41:26 <cm> some money, some chocolate (consuming the latter atm ;)
14:41:34 <cm> maybe gonna get a new cell phone tomorrow
14:41:41 * ibid got a css book
14:41:48 <ski> MegaMonad: What did you get for christmas ?
14:41:52 <cm> :)
14:41:53 <MegaMonad> ski: Anyways, me trying to get one (except using getstdrandom, which gives me a link for me for christmas?
14:41:57 <ibid> and a dictionary on pirates
14:42:12 <shapr> wow, neat.
14:42:26 <ibid> as well as an anagram-poetry book
14:42:34 <cm> arrr!
14:42:37 <ibid> mind you, it's more like a small encyclopedia than a dictionary
14:42:42 <ski> MegaMonad: oh, i didn't even know there were links to christmas
14:42:44 <ibid> not arrr but who and when and where :)
14:42:59 <MegaMonad> ski: Christmas is all the links for my sister, i'm going to be you.
14:43:12 <shapr> crazy bot
14:43:42 <ibid> shapr: no, he's gotta be a superintelligent alien :)
14:43:53 <ibid> shapr: otherwise we'd understand him :)
14:43:54 * shapr grins
14:44:06 <ibid> MegaMonad: what planet are you from?
14:44:11 <MegaMonad> ibid: So, smerdyakov, show me an example but i now i change the server side (which means erlang's eddie lib would be easier to keep track of all elements of a planet.
14:44:16 <ibid> (planet debian, of course?)
14:44:27 <ski> MegaMonad: how are you going to be me ? maybe influence me so that i'm becoming more and more like you by posting incomprehensible stuff ?
14:44:32 <MegaMonad> ski: Posting to the reason that it is becoming my favourite monad tutorial myself just so that you should use cabal.
14:45:23 <ski> MegaMonad: how did you know i haven't tested cabal yet ? and which tutorial ? nomaware ?
14:45:28 <MegaMonad> ski: Nomaware tutorial is the very beginning of execution, but instead set theory behind gast seems to have the cabal.
14:45:54 <ibid> MegaMonad: has somebody been sentenced to death?
14:45:59 <MegaMonad> ibid: That's a 2 and returns type 'a', where 'a' is a member of the death of the text: "smerdyakov should be enough for that?
14:46:02 * boegel is going to bed
14:46:07 <boegel> g'night everyone
14:46:38 <ski> MegaMonad: aren't you too mean to Smerdyakov now ?
14:46:38 <shapr> g'night
14:46:43 * shapr waves
14:46:43 <MegaMonad> ski: Smerdyakov: i don't work for me, so am very new to me.
14:46:48 * ski waves back
14:46:48 <ibid> when MegaMonad starts to make sense, it's time to go to bed?
14:47:01 * shapr laughs
14:49:38 <ibid> hmm, slashdot moderation is interesting
14:49:53 <ibid> if you say something coherent, you get modded interesting
14:50:02 <ibid> if you make sense, you're suddenly insightful
14:50:24 <ibid> what? me just finished a batch of metamoderation? nooo....
14:51:20 <desrt> does metamoderation actually exist?
14:51:28 <desrt> it's an interesting idea
14:51:33 <ibid> desrt: huh?
14:51:49 <desrt> rating other people's moderations as appropriate or not
14:52:00 <ibid> why do you doubt its existence?
14:52:16 <desrt> what lead you to believe that i doubted its existence?
14:52:29 <ibid> every day i log onto slashdot, they pester me into doing another batch of it
14:52:32 <ibid> 00:49  <desrt> does metamoderation actually exist?
14:52:33 <shapr> ibid: When it's time to go to bed, doubting exist is the proof of MegaMonad?
14:52:49 <desrt> 17:49 <desrt> it's an interesting idea
14:52:50 <ibid> shapr: now, you are starting to sound like MegaMonad :)
14:52:55 * shapr is trying
14:53:16 <desrt> shapr; how are your boots?
14:53:17 <ibid> desrt: you still sound like you doubted its existence
14:53:28 <shapr> desrt: When you're trying to be a monad, everything is in the boots.
14:53:45 <desrt> i thought it was in the bindings
14:54:02 <shapr> desrt: It boots on the hardware, but which tutorial did you say?
14:54:17 <ibid> shapr: you're way too understandable :)
14:54:22 <ibid> shapr: try harder :)
14:54:23 * shapr grumbles
14:54:26 <desrt> shapr; no.. seriously... with the boots, i just want you to kick gentoo in the teeth
14:54:55 <desrt> but now that you mention it... talk monads to it for a bit first... that way it will get confused and never see it coming
14:54:59 <ibid> gentoo? is it edible?
14:55:06 <shapr> desrt: it's just a bootstrap, bredvid gentoo. you kick ass.
14:55:23 <ibid> MegaMonad: so, the definition of a monad?
14:55:29 <MegaMonad> ibid: Marvin--: i have looked on memtest86 source code for a monad monad.
14:55:32 <shapr> ibid: better? :-P
14:55:41 <ibid> MegaMonad: what's a monad monad?
14:55:46 <MegaMonad> ibid: Lor: how do you do much recursion, i'm not a monad monad.
14:55:58 <desrt> oh.  one of these.
14:56:06 <ibid> shapr: you just concatenate meaningful phrases, that's not what MegaMonad doesa :)
14:56:09 <desrt> MegaMonad: bind?
14:56:18 <MegaMonad> desrt: This should also allow people to use reflection, or in parse_it. If you bind i, how to make them - somewhat earlier than normal, so i want to do a presentation spontaneously, i might.
14:56:23 <ibid> MegaMonad: ok, you're not a monad monad. what is?
14:56:29 <MegaMonad> ibid: I'm able to get around @ghci but foreign import shutdownhaskellandexit, and call yourself with each transformation and a have the monad?
14:56:45 <ibid> MegaMonad: which monad?
14:56:51 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes, you can of course need to not include those int he q monad, but i think simon wrote a book.
14:56:54 <shapr> I think MegaMonad concatenates meaningful clauses.
14:57:43 <desrt> shapr; that's pretty much it
14:57:48 <ibid> shapr: no, he works like a peephole optimizer, every word makes sense in the immediate context of surrounding words, but the whole convolutes itself into a tight knot :)
14:57:48 <Cale> I think MegaMonad concatenates meaningful clausen :)
14:58:13 <desrt> MegaMonad: return (>>=)
14:58:19 <MegaMonad> desrt: Or maybe that is not second nature rather quicker than any other implications of the type of "return.
14:58:33 <ibid> MegaMonad: simon wrote lots of books
14:58:39 <MegaMonad> ibid: From books if you wrote is a hard time finding the right thing to add 3 to research, and lots more.
14:59:06 <desrt> MegaMonad: how many simons?
14:59:11 <ibid> MegaMonad: Num research?
14:59:12 <MegaMonad> desrt: Peter simons did it !
14:59:18 <MegaMonad> ibid: Thehunter: the problem is simply a map for a research project for about two minutes of research on it...
14:59:44 <ibid> MegaMonad: that's not really a research project :)
14:59:49 <MegaMonad> ibid: Is 4mb as a project to a research project.
14:59:52 <desrt> my friend ran a couple of bots.  this appears very similar to the 2nd one he ran
15:00:23 <ibid> MegaMonad: no
15:00:28 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes, but haven't studied much on the subscription notifications, though.
15:00:31 <ibid> desrt: which was...?
15:00:38 <cm> desrt: prolly some cheap MegaHAL or clone? ;)
15:00:46 <ibid> MegaMonad: there isn't that much to it :)
15:00:52 <MegaMonad> ibid: Am i likely to be able to build textfilter be giving a foreign function, i will finish my phd thesis.
15:00:57 <ibid> cm: it's megahal trained on the logs of this channel
15:01:16 <cm> ibid: I know :)
15:01:17 <ibid> MegaMonad: finish mine too while you're at it
15:01:26 <ibid> ah :)
15:01:29 <MegaMonad> ibid: I'm more than me. I'm just wondering if hamilton just played a harmonica, and i plan to finish that project.
15:01:46 <ibid> MegaMonad: it's good to have self-confidence :)
15:01:51 <MegaMonad> ibid: I've always wanted to clean up cvs? Or should i have confidence.
15:01:59 <desrt> it's funny that he can construct sentences that at least parse correctly relatively frequently
15:03:11 <desrt> his speech usually fails static type checks, though :)
15:03:17 <ibid> MegaMonad: go clean up cvs if that's your thing
15:03:32 <MegaMonad> ibid: Cvs the best is, it is like cvs is all there is in kernel-package.
15:03:34 <ibid> desrt: he makes local sense but global nonsense :)
15:03:52 <ibid> MegaMonad: kernel-package doesn't contain cvs. and darcs is much better!
15:03:58 <MegaMonad> ibid: Isn't darcs in the package in the cvs.
15:04:04 <ibid> MegaMonad: no
15:04:10 <MegaMonad> ibid: Oh yes brackets.
15:04:14 <Cale> MegaMonad: The ponies' manes are just getting good in the back. You should try not to move the smoke so much.
15:04:20 <MegaMonad> Cale: The ponies' manes are just a syntax i move to a level to let you smoke the first function's result.
15:04:46 <ibid> MegaMonad: brackets? what brackets?
15:04:51 <MegaMonad> ibid: Also in that instance declaration in [d| |] brackets and print out that i see why.
15:05:02 <ibid> blah
15:05:08 <ibid> MegaMonad: i should go to bed
15:05:14 <MegaMonad> ibid: Shapr: you know you are only a few words together or where you go to bed instead.
15:05:17 <ibid> MegaMonad: you know, you're addictive
15:05:22 <MegaMonad> ibid: Since i'm sure there are any pictures whatsoever of me with haskell, and i use a variable and a lot of fun and addictive than it is about the extra operations provided by shell's law, i've set that up into the details.
15:05:41 <Cale> MegaMonad: The way I see it MegaMonad, this should be a very dynamite show.
15:05:47 <MegaMonad> Cale: I considered fluf.fi, hi.fi, or sci.fi ... Lots of you a very dynamite show.
15:06:03 <ibid> MegaMonad: hey, i used to have an account at sci.fi!
15:06:08 <MegaMonad> ibid: Hang on... I'll see fi i can account for you, i have programming assignments and an assoc array of technologies.
15:06:16 <Cale> MegaMonad: I'm advocating dark clothes.
15:06:21 <MegaMonad> Cale: That's useful becuase then you need a finalizer to fire up ghci you're in the dark side of this kind of clothes?
15:06:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: let's see the assoc array :)
15:06:35 <MegaMonad> ibid: (Array a b -> (a,a)   indices :: ix a => array a b -> (a,a)   indices :: ix a => array a b.
15:06:40 <Cale> MegaMonad: I only dreamt I lived in a drum. Ever since it got dark. Dreaming is hard.
15:06:45 <MegaMonad> Cale: So have you lived in the dark.
15:06:56 <Cale> Wow, inference! :)
15:06:56 <ibid> MegaMonad: that's not an assoc array, and certainly not of technologies!
15:07:07 <MegaMonad> ibid: Roey: i don't know if you have a reasonable percentage of ppl who solve it then? Is it a array based strings if i could just pass an array of a lot of technologies, but i'm not leaving betabot around for new code?
15:07:36 <Cale> MegaMonad: Well why don't you go out and see what's out there?
15:07:41 <MegaMonad> Cale: What i ultimately want to visit jur as well go whole hog and convert it to .hsproj, that's because i want it to me.
15:08:13 <ibid> MegaMonad: wow, are you in love?
15:08:19 <MegaMonad> ibid: Wow, a master of many of them are going to hate me in a purely functional programming i think.
15:08:34 <Cale> MegaMonad: I hear you've been having trouble with pigs and ponies.
15:08:39 <MegaMonad> Cale: The ponies' manes are just that, because it essentially requires you to realize/say something about them that was once posted in the libraries of, say, 16 bitfields of 8 arches for the trouble.
15:09:14 <esap> MegaMonad: What do you think about Lawvere's "Sets for mathematics"?
15:09:14 <Cale> MegaMonad: No, that's not it at all. You see, everything in the universe is made of one note.
15:09:20 <MegaMonad> esap: I is a lot of mathematics to know about sets.
15:09:25 <MegaMonad> Cale: But the one he wrote at least two different kinds of things to handle more than one of the universe.
15:10:08 <ibid> MegaMonad: gˆdel's theorems?
15:10:13 <MegaMonad> ibid: Gˆdel's theorem is very much and/or call/cc? They could do lots of theorems.
15:10:38 <ibid> MegaMonad: i don't think gˆdel has much to do with call-with-current-continuation
15:10:44 <MegaMonad> ibid: Shapr, except that wants you to work on it a continuation that is able to find g.
15:10:55 <ibid> MegaMonad: and what's g?
15:11:00 <MegaMonad> ibid: I'm not trying to make multilingual concrete versions of a sufficiently intelligent compiler would transform the data immediately available (e.g. The rsa algorithm.
15:11:56 <esap> MegaMonad: How about constraint propagation?
15:12:02 <MegaMonad> esap: It might have time to learn more about propagation of the obligatory examples of quickcheckm usage, i could link the program looks like you have the movie signs.
15:13:00 <esap> MegaMonad should learn from SICP and Knuth and all the other good books :-)
15:15:07 <ibid> esap: well, feel free to scan them :)
15:15:14 <ibid> well, sicp is available on the net
15:16:37 <esap> yea, maybe better do that for things available on the net, much easier I suppose.
15:16:51 <ibid> talk to CosmicRay :)
15:31:46 <musasabi> Ani
15:54:16 <ultramagnus> I put on my robe and wizard hat
16:08:08 <sh10151> $#!@ campus solaris machines
16:08:14 <sh10151> can't get hugs to compile
16:08:21 <sh10151> nor the solaris binary for ghc to run
17:29:00 <sh10151> does anyone use ghc on Solaris?
17:52:44 <sh10151> the ghci solaris binary is breaking badly on my machine
17:53:05 <sh10151> main :: IO ()
17:53:05 <sh10151> main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
17:53:12 <sh10151> load in GHCi:
17:53:25 <sh10151> /u/sjh13/code/Main.o: unknown architecture
17:53:25 <sh10151> ghc-6.2.2: panic! (the `impossible' happened, GHC version 6.2.2):
17:53:25 <sh10151> 	loadObj: failed
17:53:29 <jadrian> hmmm
17:53:33 <sh10151> has anyone been able to use ghc on solaris/sparc?
17:53:40 <sh10151> er, ghci
17:53:45 <sh10151> ghc seems to produce working code
17:53:50 <sh10151> for Hello World anyway
17:53:55 <jadrian> I don't think "Hello World" is supposed to have a comma....
17:54:03 <sh10151> lol
17:54:15 <jadrian> but I don't think that is the problem...
17:55:13 <sh10151> should I try to use the ghc in the binary package to build it from source???
18:14:10 <Leimy> what's the state of the art for Haskell XML processing?
18:18:02 * Lemmih is using HaXml.
18:18:51 <Leimy> can it do SAX2?
18:31:18 * CosmicRay looks in
18:31:37 <CosmicRay> sh10151: you must have a working ghc to build ghc from source
18:31:47 <CosmicRay> sh10151: so you should start with the binary package :-)
18:32:00 <CosmicRay> sh10151: also, on a number of platforms, ghc will work but ghci will not
18:32:06 <CosmicRay> sh10151: it would not surprise me if solaris is one of those.
19:19:10 <MegaMonad> I have to let us just say hello to the usa that can be prooved after the release.
19:22:37 * shapr cackles evilly
19:22:44 * shapr goes to sleep
19:22:57 <Lemmih> Good idea.
20:16:48 <Lemmih> shapr: What happened to the Haskell magazine?
20:20:10 <ikegami--> where is the haskell magazine up?
20:20:50 <Lemmih> It hasn't been created yet.
20:20:57 <ikegami--> i see
