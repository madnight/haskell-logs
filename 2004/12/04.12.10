00:14:45 <SyntaxNinja> cool. thanks!
00:26:27 <asmodai> mmm
00:26:38 <asmodai> What are the standard extensions used for haskell files?
00:29:31 <kosmikus> .hs and .lhs
00:29:50 <kosmikus> .lhs for "literate Haskell" files
00:31:39 <asmodai> ahh
00:31:52 <asmodai> sankyu
00:33:53 * asmodai goes to try his first steps in Haskell land
00:35:13 <Itkovian> have fun
00:38:18 <asmodai> heh
00:43:33 <Muad_Dibber> hmm
00:43:46 <shapr> @yow !
00:43:46 <lambdabot> Didn't I buy a 1951 Packard from you last March in Cairo?
00:47:00 <asmodai> shapr!
00:47:08 <shapr> hiya asmodai 
00:47:51 <asmodai> shapr: howsa you doing?
00:48:51 <shapr> At this instant, slightly irritated to be living in the primary military town in Sweden. They started artillery practice at 8am, and I had calculated my six hours of sleep to end at 9:30am.
00:48:55 <shapr> Howsa you?
00:52:26 <asmodai> shapr: Jag har det bra.
00:52:42 <asmodai> (IIRC my svenska)
00:52:48 <shapr> jo, det √§r bra
00:52:54 <shapr> ik begrip het.
00:52:59 <asmodai> begrijp ;)
00:53:07 <asmodai> but amazed at your hollandsk/nederlandsk ;)
00:53:26 <shapr> well, begrip is svenska too.
00:53:31 <asmodai> owww
00:53:34 <asmodai> cool
00:53:40 <asmodai> jag begrip det?
00:59:06 <Itkovian> what does "Jag har det bra" mean?
00:59:50 <asmodai> Itkovian: I am fine.  More literally: I have it well/good
01:01:14 <shapr> yah
01:01:46 <shapr> Swedish is a neat language. So is Dutch.
01:02:11 <asmodai> Tack.
01:02:42 <asmodai> My brazilian-japanese (hopefully to be gf) friend speaks Dutch/German/Swedish, which was quite a surprise. :)
01:03:16 <shapr> That is surprising.
01:03:27 <asmodai> *nod*
01:03:29 <shapr> Why Swedish?
01:03:35 <asmodai> She's a smart cute woman
01:04:00 <asmodai> shapr: Don't know, German she learns at school.  Dutch is an interest which I am helping with.  Swedish I think she learnt at school as well
01:04:18 <kosmikus> Igloo: did your nhc98 assembler fix not make it into CVS? I still get segmentation faults building the HEAD ...
01:04:26 <Itkovian> Hmm ... Dutch ... I know it of course, but they keep changing the bloody rules. Now I write as I see fit. Stupid exceptions. I don;t think even most Dutch teachers can spell everything correctly.
01:05:48 <kosmikus> you think it's better elsewhere?
01:06:27 <asmodai> Itkovian: I disagree with a lot of the rule changes.
01:06:33 <Itkovian> no but I think for most modern languages the 'spelling rules' are more or less evolving only very slowly
01:06:48 <Itkovian> I disagree with almost everything they change
01:06:52 <asmodai> Itkovian: I might not be the most perfect speaker/writer of my own language, but some of these changes are nuttier
01:07:24 <Itkovian> from c to k, then to c but sometimes a c and a k, whereas twice a c in the word would be much easier, or twice a k ... 
01:07:30 <asmodai> heh
01:07:34 * asmodai still uses bureau
01:07:36 <Itkovian> Well, I mostly speak Ostend dialect ;-)
01:07:44 <asmodai> buro is so, ew.
01:07:57 <Itkovian> all right ... erm ... I don;t think buro is acceptable ... no?
01:08:01 <asmodai> It is.
01:08:04 <Itkovian> aaargh
01:08:07 <Itkovian> foul
01:08:15 <asmodai> kado
01:08:18 <asmodai> instead of cadeau
01:08:19 <Itkovian> hi boegel
01:08:29 <Itkovian> no no no ... cadeau it is.
01:08:35 <asmodai> faktuur instead of factuur
01:08:38 <Itkovian> aren't you reading poetic advanced stuff?
01:08:46 <asmodai> Itkovian: not at all.
01:08:50 <Itkovian> dang
01:08:56 <asmodai> mm, vandale doesn't list buro
01:09:01 <Itkovian> heh
01:09:02 <asmodai> there might be hope
01:09:31 <Itkovian> jot, mor os ze azo bluuvn verder doen goddet up gin zak mi trekkn ;-)
01:09:38 <Itkovian> eat this :-)
01:09:50 * asmodai points out he has relatives living in Belgium.
01:09:55 <Itkovian> heh
01:09:58 <Itkovian> where?
01:10:06 * kosmikus is still unhappy with the German spelling reform, too
01:10:08 <asmodai> Chaam, Baarle-Nassau
01:10:17 <asmodai> around there.
01:10:18 <Itkovian> where the heck is that?
01:10:27 <Itkovian> Wallonie?
01:10:32 <asmodai> neuh
01:10:38 <Itkovian> Limburg?
01:10:41 <asmodai> kosmikus: So I heard.
01:10:52 * Itkovian know virtually no German
01:10:55 <asmodai> Itkovian: just below breda/tilburg if you drive down
01:10:56 <Itkovian> *knows
01:10:59 <Itkovian> ah ok
01:11:17 <Itkovian> they don;t speak west-flemish over there :-)
01:11:19 <kosmikus> but changes aside, I find Dutch spelling relatively regular and easy to learn
01:11:32 <asmodai> and language skills are getting worse with the SMS/instant messaging generation
01:11:38 <Itkovian> true
01:11:49 <vegai> not to mention the IRC-generation
01:11:50 * asmodai has been scolding his younger nephews and nieces and cousins to use full sentences.
01:11:51 <Itkovian> i seldom communicate in actual Dutch
01:12:08 <Itkovian> mostly it's local language ...
01:12:12 <asmodai> Once you start deteriorating your language on chat it will effect "real-world" as well.
01:12:18 <kosmikus> it's a nice country anyway -- to bad I'll most likely have to leave soon ;)
01:12:18 <Itkovian> which changes avery 10 km or so ;-)
01:12:24 <kosmikus> /s/to/too
01:12:33 <Itkovian> which? Holland? 
01:12:47 <kosmikus> yes, .nl
01:12:50 <Itkovian> heh
01:13:04 <Itkovian> well ... I'm Belgian so ...
01:13:06 <asmodai> Holland, ewww.
01:13:12 <asmodai> Holland is just two provinces.
01:13:19 <asmodai> The Netherlands is the correct form. :)
01:13:23 <asmodai> thankyouverymuch :)
01:13:33 <kosmikus> I know ;)
01:13:35 <Itkovian> well, we call you guys 'Ollanders' ...
01:13:43 <asmodai> Itkovian: Jot.
01:14:01 <asmodai> Well, given what is happening in EU
01:14:14 <asmodai> I am placing bets on a civil war and WWIII within a few years anyway.
01:14:38 <vegai> hmm
01:14:48 * vegai contemplates moving to Canada.
01:15:00 <vegai> they'll have a huge immigration problem soon ...
01:15:23 <asmodai> I read today over 5000 US troops have requested political asylum in Canada
01:15:23 <kosmikus> asmodai: civil war in the EU? don't think so
01:15:51 <asmodai> kosmikus: From what I have been gathering around, observing news, trends, I think it is quite inevitable.
01:16:07 <boegel> Itkovian, goaj ze leirn klapn h√® ?
01:16:12 <Itkovian> be jakk gie
01:16:18 <boegel> s/h√®/th√®
01:16:25 <asmodai> haha, that reminds me of akkergie ;)
01:16:27 <boegel> lol :D
01:16:39 <boegel> asmodai, you mean 'akkerdjie'
01:16:41 <asmodai> woops
01:16:45 <asmodai> precies
01:16:46 <boegel> :p
01:16:47 <Itkovian> which is something else entirely
01:16:52 <asmodai> *thinks back of the Merlina days*
01:17:03 <boegel> Itkovian, what does 'akkergie' mean then ? :p
01:17:06 <asmodai> Nonkel X
01:17:23 <Itkovian> isn;t it a curse? it's used like one afaik ...
01:17:49 <Itkovian> boegel: u are from which city/town?
01:17:50 <boegel> Itkovian, 'akkerdjie' is, I don't know 'akkergie' :p
01:18:01 <boegel> Itkovian, Torhout :D
01:18:03 * asmodai meant akkerdjie
01:18:12 <vegai> the Netherlands should change their name to Netherworld for extreme retro-gaming coolness value
01:18:13 <Itkovian> it sounds like akkergee, which is how uones pronounces 'akkerdjie'
01:18:25 <asmodai> vegai: How so?
01:18:32 <boegel> maybe some people know it in here, from the rock festival T/W
01:18:33 <Itkovian> ah, ne westvloamink
01:18:42 <vegai> asmodai: it's so close to it anyway :P
01:18:50 <Itkovian> hehe
01:19:07 <asmodai> vegai: hahah
01:19:08 <boegel> Itkovian, where are you from?
01:19:13 <asmodai> boegel: I know Torhout.
01:19:22 <boegel> asmodai, yaay
01:19:28 <asmodai> boegel: Not that far from Baal (baarle-hertog/baarle-nassau and Chaam)
01:19:50 <boegel> asmodai: depends on what you call 'not far' :p
01:19:56 <boegel> here not far is less then 10 km
01:20:01 <boegel> it's a small country :p
01:20:34 <boegel> (that should be 'less than 10 km, right ?)
01:20:47 <Itkovian> yeah, everything over 10 km is way beyond ...
01:20:52 <asmodai> oh wacht
01:20:55 <asmodai> Turnhout
01:20:56 <Itkovian> like in the next town ...
01:21:01 * asmodai confused Torhout and Turnhout
01:21:15 <asmodai> Torhout's near Brugge
01:21:17 <Itkovian> Well, Turnhout is located in Limburg, whereas Torhout is West-Flanders
01:21:33 <tuomov> I don't know about civil war, but the world is becoming so messed up that something is going to happen
01:21:37 <Itkovian> And we ain't have the same language, I can assure you!
01:21:42 <Itkovian> :-)
01:21:57 <boegel> asmodai: idd
01:22:41 <boegel> I think 80% of Belgium doesn't understand our 'language', while we do understand their language
01:22:51 <asmodai> tuomov: Well, from my discussions with people all over the world it seems inevitable that there will be a major clash between the followers of islam and most other cultures.  Even liberal friends of mine in Saudi Arabia think that it is hard to change the Wahhabistic course.
01:23:11 <boegel> asmodai: I totally agree
01:23:34 <asmodai> tuomov: Same with what I discern in Indonesia from my friends, Thailand.  Now the integration failures becoming apparent throughout Europe.
01:23:40 <boegel> people are just going to kill themselves over simple things
01:23:53 <boegel> basic needs, like water, food, freedom, and so on
01:24:23 <tuomov> I'm more thinking of the class war here..
01:24:31 <asmodai> tuomov: Poor versus rich?
01:24:41 <tuomov> yes
01:24:42 <Itkovian> Hmm ... I think europeans should be a tad more tolerant ...
01:24:51 <tuomov> social security is crumbling down, less people are doing more
01:25:15 <Itkovian> well, recently companies restarted hiring 50+ (age) people 
01:25:22 <asmodai> Itkovian: Mmm, tough one.  Since the stance towards life is almost 180 oppositional between current 'western' thinking and typical 'islam' thinking.
01:25:30 <asmodai> tuomov: true, socsec is down the shitters.
01:25:40 <Itkovian> when the production should be increased during a few weeks/months ...
01:25:44 <vegai> by the way, I think the editor j is vastly better than anything out there. Anyone using anything else must be out of his mind!
01:25:58 * Itkovian uses vim
01:26:08 <asmodai> vegai: j?  I primarily use vim, on Windows PSPad, UltraEdit or jEdit
01:26:22 * Itkovian doesn't do windows
01:26:29 <vegai> ;)
01:26:41 <vegai> perhaps my point was a bit far-fetched there, sorry =)
01:26:47 <Itkovian> lol
01:26:57 <asmodai> vegai: ;)
01:27:02 <asmodai> vegai: I know.
01:27:10 * boegel uses emacs
01:27:11 <Itkovian> asmodai: Still, being scared of moslim people is just stupid. 
01:27:15 * asmodai just loves going along in such nonsensical comments.
01:27:19 <asmodai> Itkovian: Yes and no.
01:27:34 <Itkovian> amodai: the problem is that we do not understand their language
01:27:42 <asmodai> Itkovian: yes, it is dumb, since it is reminding of the 'fear of the dark' problem.
01:27:43 <boegel> Itkovian: their idea about life it totally different from ours
01:27:52 <boegel> Itkovian: and that can be pretty scary
01:28:01 <Itkovian> Perhaps, but who says ours is superior?
01:28:03 <asmodai> Itkovian: No, I've seen islam from up close, I've been to the Middle East and I have muslim friends and I can tell you
01:28:08 <tuomov> what is "ours"?
01:28:14 <boegel> you won't go flying into a building when you're not _sure_ that you and your family will benefit from it
01:28:20 <asmodai> if you value Kierkegaard's view on life or other typical humanists or philosophers
01:28:23 <Itkovian> ours = stupid white men ;-)
01:28:32 <asmodai> you will not like Islam tradition and culture
01:28:41 <tuomov> christian fundamentalists?
01:28:45 <asmodai> since it is reminiscent of 1000-1500 AD of Europe
01:28:50 <boegel> Itkovian: I never said any is superior... it(s just the great difference between the two which is the problem
01:29:03 <asmodai> when the clergy ruled all layers of society
01:29:04 <Itkovian> Maybe I won't, I certainly will not adapt their religion, but hey ... they're people too ...
01:29:34 <tuomov> all organised religion is bad.
01:29:34 <asmodai> They're people.  But to the majority of them you are 'kafir'.
01:29:39 <asmodai> Lesser in their book.
01:29:46 <asmodai> tuomov: Religion is the politics of spirituality. :)
01:29:46 <Itkovian> let's not go into the religous stuff, ok ...
01:29:50 * boegel hopes WOIII won't be in the next 80 years, because he doesn't want to be any part of it
01:30:21 <asmodai> boegel: I hope it will never come, but my projections based on world wide events are not positive.
01:30:28 <asmodai> boegel: Take Taiwan <> China.
01:30:33 <Itkovian> I agree that it's a problem ... but running scared will not solve it.
01:30:37 <boegel> I've heard stories from elderly about WOII, and I really don't want to witness those
01:30:48 <shrimpx> what's WOIII
01:30:49 <boegel> or the stuff you see on TV in Iraq on so on
01:30:52 <asmodai> boegel: if the current party stays, the government in Taiwan will declare independence.
01:30:55 <asmodai> shrimpx: WW 3
01:30:58 <asmodai> world war 3
01:31:01 <Itkovian> I know somebody who was on the death march ... well, let me assure you ... you do not want war.
01:31:06 <shrimpx> WW3 makes more sense :)
01:31:17 <asmodai> shrimpx: wo = wereld oorlog, dutch
01:31:21 <Itkovian> shrimpx: WO = dutch for WW
01:31:23 <shrimpx> ah
01:31:25 <shrimpx> cool
01:31:32 <boegel> shrimpx: sorry :)
01:31:44 <Itkovian> let's not get pessimistic.
01:31:49 <asmodai> boegel: ROC/China will not like it, yet the US stated they are friends of Taiwan.
01:32:00 <shrimpx> i thought everyone was raving that WW3 is in progress
01:32:04 <asmodai> Itkovian: There's a difference between pessimism and realism.
01:32:11 <Itkovian> that's true
01:32:22 <boegel> and we all know what China, Japan and such are capable of *cough* Pearl Harbor *cough*
01:32:24 <asmodai> Besides, I walk the Middle Path anyway. :)
01:32:36 * shrimpx too
01:32:43 <shrimpx> also known as MP
01:32:46 <asmodai> boegel: And we all know what the US is capable of *cough* Hiroshima, Nagasaki *cough*
01:33:05 <boegel> I think having no religion at all is the best thing... if you can handle living without any form of religion
01:33:23 <asmodai> boegel: I am doing fine as buddhist.
01:33:32 <boegel> so if the US makes Japan/China mad, they'll react, and the US will counter it :(
01:33:59 <asmodai> boegel: But I can tell you, telling people who are religious that you don't adhere to a god idea is hard for them to accept at times. :(
01:34:00 <boegel> asmodai: nice. But I don't like any religion
01:34:07 <asmodai> boegel: it isn't a religion
01:34:10 <shapr> asmodai: not always
01:34:24 <asmodai> shapr: The acceptance you mean?
01:34:27 <boegel> asmodai: what is it then ? you have a god too, don't you ? Boeddha ?
01:34:34 <shrimpx> haha
01:34:35 <asmodai> Buddha is not a god at all!
01:34:49 <shapr> I'm a Baptist, but I don't feel the need to convince other people that the way I choose is the right way to go.
01:34:50 <asmodai> He clary stated he was not meant to be revered in any way.
01:34:51 <tuomov> buddha has a sort of god-like status
01:34:59 <Itkovian> yeah boegel ... most people here tend to think that but it's wrong
01:35:13 <asmodai> people who you see 'praying' at the statues of 'buddha' are merely saying thanks for the teachings 
01:35:34 <shrimpx> i think that's kinda stupid too, in my interpretation of buddhism
01:35:37 <asmodai> besides, buddha is a generic term
01:36:00 <shapr> I think everyone should decide for themselves.
01:36:30 <tuomov> most people can't if they've been brainwashed constantly since childhood
01:36:51 <shrimpx> religion is the root of war, but without religion we wouldn't go to heaven. paradox!
01:37:06 <shapr> I think the love of money is the root of evil.
01:37:12 <Itkovian> well, I think a parent should teach his/her children what they think is right, but let the children decide for themselves when old enough
01:37:22 <Itkovian> shapr: Paul said that :-)
01:37:29 * shapr grins
01:37:40 <Itkovian> shrimpx: what makes you think we should go to heaven?
01:38:14 <shrimpx> i was being sarcastic
01:38:25 <Itkovian> good :-)
01:38:52 * boegel often wonders if there is anything beyond death, or if you just stop existing (like when you sleep)
01:38:52 <shapr> Anyway, I think people should be allowed to choose the procedural path.
01:38:53 <Itkovian> I think religion is a very difficult topic to discuss
01:38:57 <shapr> EVEN IF IT'S WRONG!
01:39:00 * shapr pretends to be a fanatic
01:39:17 <shrimpx> shapr: i think that idea is fading away. i think power is increasingly being asserted for reasons besides material posessions
01:39:17 <shapr> lambdabot: seek and destroy all procedural coders!
01:39:17 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
01:39:23 <asmodai> shrimpx: Why?  Nothing wrong with giving thanks.  The statue symbolises what humans can achieve (human perfection through the letting go of ego), it also shows the human aspect, that we should look within ourselves.  The perfume of the incense the influence of virtue, the light of wisdom, and the flowers of impermanence.  The smile and rested hands the peace and love we should develop.
01:39:31 <shapr> shrimpx: dude, you must be joking.
01:39:36 <asmodai> shrimpx: of course, to each his own. :)
01:39:45 * boegel is off, trying to wake up
01:39:46 <shrimpx> asmodai: sure
01:39:54 <asmodai> Itkovian: My dad's catholic, mom's protestant, they left me free of any baptising.
01:40:00 <asmodai> Itkovian: I became buddhist in the end.
01:41:19 <asmodai> shapr: wrt money, I've been wondering how the world would need to work should we absolve capitalism and instead work for the greater good of mankind
01:41:31 <asmodai> We're capable of so much more, yet waste it on such petty things.
01:42:06 <shapr> I don't think it's going to to happen.
01:42:18 <tuomov> money may not need to be abolished, but absolute propery rights should be
01:42:19 <shapr> People just aren't perfect enough.
01:42:25 <asmodai> It requires a mental adjustment.
01:42:31 <tuomov> to be replaced with personal posessions/occupancy & use rights
01:42:33 <shapr> Oh wait, I remember I have a political agenda here...
01:42:33 <asmodai> shapr: I am afraid of that yes.
01:42:43 <shapr> ahem, let's start by eliminating procedural coders!
01:43:04 * shapr waves the lambda pom-poms
01:43:23 <asmodai> Thinking either the functional or procedural path is the absolute is as silly as thinking your own view of the truth is the absolute one. ;)
01:43:36 <shapr> I know, I'm just being a smart ass as usual.
01:43:40 <asmodai> That's ok.
01:43:43 <asmodai> We love you for that.
01:43:51 <shapr> Anyway, Haskell is the best procedural programming language available.
01:44:04 <shapr> That's part of the humor of being a functional programming fanatic.
01:44:26 <asmodai> You're a teddy bear, now hush.
01:44:26 <asmodai> ;)
01:44:31 <shapr> Oh, and I'm wonderful and modest, and I'm not a fanatic.
01:44:48 <shapr> @yow !
01:44:49 <lambdabot> When this load is DONE I think I'll wash it AGAIN..
01:45:19 <shapr> I'm a teddy bear?
01:45:34 <shapr> I wonder what it would be like being a stuffed animal.
01:46:05 <shapr> Must be the most boring existence in the world. You sit on a shelf and look cute. I think I'd rather be a useful tool that someone uses all the time. Maybe a Leatherman on someone's belt. 
01:46:30 <shapr> Anyway, one of my paying clients wants to use some Haskell software I wrote! w00!
01:47:00 <shapr> I'm getting paid to setup and maintain open source software I wrote myself! and it's written in HASKELL!
01:47:05 * shapr dances ecstatically
01:47:27 <shapr> asmodai: what do you think of Haskell so far?
01:47:53 <asmodai> shapr: Well, you could use better docs for the procedural people wanting to use Haskell for the first time
01:47:56 * asmodai is compiling notes
01:48:00 <shapr> Any specific questions?
01:48:01 * asmodai laughs:
01:48:03 <asmodai> http://www.allaahuakbar.net/buddhism/reality_of_idol_worship_and_buddhism.htm
01:48:08 * asmodai stumbled on this.
01:48:26 <asmodai> I love people who don't check facts.  Ah well.
01:48:26 <Muad_Dibber> asmodai: you dutch?
01:48:29 <asmodai> Ignorance is bliss.
01:48:33 <asmodai> Muad_Dibber: Geloof het wel ja.
01:48:38 <shapr> Bliss is a good set of unit tests.
01:48:38 * asmodai kijkt naar zijn stamboom.
01:48:44 <Muad_Dibber> asmodai: okay, dan ben je niet de asmodai die ik ken :)
01:48:45 <shapr> ik ben een kikke.
01:48:53 <shapr> ik hebbe een tandeborstal.
01:48:55 <asmodai> shapr: kikker?
01:48:59 <Muad_Dibber> hehe shapr :)
01:49:05 <shapr> bah, I can't spell dutch.
01:49:09 <asmodai> Muad_Dibber: The other guy a US based guy by the name of Chance?
01:49:31 <Muad_Dibber> well, i cant spell englihs shapr ;)
01:49:33 <Muad_Dibber> asmodai: UK
01:50:10 <shapr> It's terribly sensible to call frogs "kickers"
01:51:33 <shapr> Most languages are literal rather than poetic. Unicycle in Swedish is "enhjuling" which means "one wheeler"
01:51:42 <asmodai> sensible?  or insensible? ;)
01:52:18 * asmodai tries to remember what unicycle was in Dutch
01:52:24 <tuomov> in finnish it would be yksipy√∂r√§inen, "one-wheeled"
01:52:36 <shapr> once again, very sensible
01:53:27 <asmodai> Speaking of Finland
01:53:51 <asmodai> H.I.M.++
01:59:31 <bens> i have a small question, is there a common method, in Haskell, to return a lazy list from a monadic function? (IO)
02:03:43 <Lemmih> @type System.IO.Unsafe.unsafeInterleaveIO
02:03:44 <lambdabot> System.IO.Unsafe.unsafeInterleaveIO :: forall a. IO a -> IO a
02:04:44 <bens> thanks, i'll go look at that
02:10:46 <shapr> People must think I'm old, they keep calling me Pre-Madonna.
02:13:45 <wli> heh
02:20:30 <Muad_Dibber> asmodai: unicycle == een wieler? :P
02:20:33 <Muad_Dibber> like i know :P
02:20:41 <asmodai> Muad_Dibber: hehe
02:21:09 <asmodai> eenwieler seems to be it
02:23:48 <wli> shapr: Attila the Functional Programmer?
02:24:11 <shapr> Oh, is that what AFP stands for? :-)

02:36:56 <dblhelix> MegaMonad: what if I yow you?
02:37:02 <MegaMonad> dblhelix: C-- is c as you said you compiled it with m-x yow to talk to you too.
02:46:26 <boegel> hey bourbaki
02:48:56 <boegel> bourbaki: can you show me a website (or book maybe) where refraction is explained properly ? I mean, more than just the equation to refract a ray
02:51:41 <shapr> g'day sazzle 
03:20:47 <bourbaki> boegel: sry erm not from top of my head do you just need the formula? you should look for the fresnel term
03:25:25 <boegel> bourbaki: I need more info than that, because I can't get it to work properly, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong
03:26:36 <boegel> bourbaki: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic/transp/

03:40:10 <TheHunter> moin bourbaki 
03:40:28 <TheHunter> what's up?
03:41:03 <bourbaki> nothing much playing a go drinking tea and freezing :)
03:42:21 <boegel> I have to go to class in a while, but I don't feel like it :(
03:42:55 <TheHunter> boegel, what kind of class?
03:43:31 <boegel> operating systems
03:44:37 <boegel> it the last class of this semester, so it's pretty important
03:51:57 * boegel slaps himself, and gets up to catch his train to class

03:54:43 <shapr> hm, I guess the TopicModule could just parse that way instead of using Read
03:54:50 <srid> shapr: yes
03:55:04 <srid> shapr: the links are linkified wrongly in most IRC clients
03:55:14 <shapr> srid: the topic format was that of a list in Haskell, because the channel bot understands that format.
03:55:17 <srid> shapr: or i guess "," must be " , "
03:55:28 <srid> oh
03:55:36 --- topic: set to '["The Nov 2004 HC&A Report is released! - http://haskell.org/communities/","Learning Haskell - http://www.haskell.org/learning.html","We put the Funk in Funktion","See logs @ http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/haskell/","related channels #haskell.se #haskelldb #darcs","http://www.haskell.org/cabal/","Haskell is the language of choice for discriminating hackers! - ICFP contest 2004", "To me java is a monomorphic type"]' by srid
03:55:58 <shapr> You could change the TopicModule if you want :-)
03:56:49 * srid is a FP newbie .. yet to learn lisp, haskell .. and he knew python
03:57:20 <shapr> I went from Python to Haskell.
03:57:27 <shapr> u1sf: hiya Si\ how's code?
03:57:38 <shapr> srid: do you have any questions?
03:58:04 <srid> shapr: nothing .. just waiting for PCL to complete .. and then will get a good haskell book
03:58:12 <shapr> PCL?
04:00:14 <srid> shapr: PCL = http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/
04:00:26 <shapr> oh, neat
04:01:13 <srid> shapr: any preferred haskell book?
04:01:36 <shapr> Do you want hardcopy?
04:01:43 <srid> whatever ..
04:01:55 <srid> softcopy is preferred
04:03:09 <shapr> In that case, I'd suggest Hal Daume's "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial"
04:03:16 <srid> shapr: did you *completely* from python to haskell?
04:03:21 <shapr> I did.
04:03:41 <srid> shapr: actually haskell doesn't have modules .. it's like C++ namespaces ... 
04:03:59 <shapr> I wasn't really planning to switch primary languages, I just knew I was dissatisfied with Python and I wanted something more.
04:04:14 <shapr> So I started learning several different languages.
04:04:22 <srid> shapr: so I guess you would have thrown java to the shit ;)
04:04:56 <shapr> I had some of my own ideas about how I like to program. After I had explored these ideas in some depth, a friend of mine asked me if I used to write Haskell code. But I knew only the name, nothing about the language.
04:05:33 <srid> shapr: you know lisp?
04:05:35 <shapr> I've had several jobs writing Java. I don't really like the language/libraries/JVM that much. On the good side, there's Jython. And there are a lot of Java libraries, so that's a plus.
04:05:45 <shapr> I've done scheme and elisp, but not common lisp.
04:06:00 <srid> so how do lisp and haskell compare?
04:06:34 * srid is desperately searching for softcopy for 'Ansi Lisp' by paul graham
04:06:34 <shapr> That requires a large answer to be accurate, but I can give you some shorter inaccurate comparisons.
04:06:53 <srid> oh yes
04:07:06 <xerox> 'morning
04:07:40 <srid> in my city this book (AL) is rare :(
04:07:54 <srid> non-availability of books is bad
04:08:38 <shapr> Haskell is purely functional, Lisp is not. Lisp has extremely regular syntax, making unhygienic macros easy to implement. Haskell has less regular syntax, but has a really neat typesystem.
04:09:08 <shapr> Lisp syntax is so regular that it is nearly its own abstract syntax tree.
04:09:28 <shapr> Haskell is a thin layer on top of the lambda calculus, so in some ways it's more 'pure' than Lisp.
04:10:28 <shapr> Haskell is further away from the popular procedural mindset than lisp. Haskell doesn't have variables, only constants that you can create and shadow. Haskell doesn't have loops, only recursion.
04:10:41 * dblhelix notes that Haskell's (less regular) syntax makes it quite suitable for embedding DSLs
04:10:49 <srid> i could not understand this: "haskell is more pure than lisp" .. i guess it is lisp that should be pure .. as it has simple and universal syntax . or am I wrong?
04:10:53 <srid> no loops!
04:11:06 * wli uses Haskell in a way that vaguely demeans it, i.e. as a calculator -like system.
04:11:24 <shapr> srid: like I said "for some value of pure" Lisp has a simpler syntax, Haskell has a simpler evaluation model, and is simpler under the  hood. (in some ways)
04:11:31 <wli> Though often also where others would use perl/etc. for munging text.
04:11:51 <shapr> Once again, a truly accurate answer would require that you understand Haskell so you'd really know the differences :-)
04:11:57 <srid> shapr: which order is preferred for learning this languages? lisp then haskell or the other way?
04:12:10 <shapr> srid: whatever you want, I guess.
04:12:14 <srid> wli: for some reason, i would always use python for that
04:12:15 <shapr> What's your goal?
04:12:24 <srid> shapr: to get to know the FP world
04:12:30 <tuomov> I don't know much lisp...
04:12:32 <dblhelix> under the hood, haskell is indeed very textbook-ish, which I consider a huge advantage
04:12:42 <srid> shapr: learning languages is fun .. at least from now :)
04:12:44 <shapr> srid: in that case I'd recommend you learn Haskell first, because it will force you to do FP.
04:12:45 <tuomov> haskell was easy enough to learn without previous fp experience
04:12:58 <shapr> Yes, I very much enjoy learning programming languages.
04:13:23 <shapr> I've been studying concatenative languages lately, they're interesting.
04:14:13 <dblhelix> mmm ... wouldn't it be fare to point out some downsides of haskell too? (or would that result in being banned?)
04:14:18 <shapr> Some of the especially neat tricks in Haskell are lazy evaluation, partial application, typeclasses, a really cool heavy duty typesystem, and more.
04:14:25 <shapr> dblhelix: I'll do it!
04:14:36 <dblhelix> :) figured
04:14:59 <shapr> The primary downside of everyday use of Haskell is that lazy evaluation can leave some parts unevaluated, and they can consume a huge amount of ram.
04:16:05 <shapr> And sometimes when you plug together two pieces of code, you get unexpected space usage. Basically, in some cases two pieces of code that behave just fine by themselves eat all your memory when plugged together.
04:16:11 <dblhelix> I myself find it too harsh to say that Haskell's too slow for real-world apps, but it's a argument that's certainly out there
04:16:13 <srid> I would really like to see python,lisp,haskell, .... in ICPC (www.acmicpc.org)
04:16:35 <shapr> I don't think Haskell is too slow, it's faster than Python, and I make my living with Python .
04:16:50 <shapr> But I wouldn't use Haskell for device drivers, that's true.
04:17:06 <shapr> Though there are some neat userspace kernel tools written in Python :-)
04:17:23 <srid> gmailfs!
04:17:28 <shapr> right
04:18:04 <dblhelix> space consumption can be problematic, but good profiling can save a lot there, although it's often cumbersome
04:18:18 <musasabi> shapr: I was thinking just a few days ago how using haskell for a kernel would make sense.
04:18:21 <srid> is YAHT by the language author?
04:18:29 <shapr> Haskell doesn't have many pieces to learn, but those few pieces are surprisingly expressive.
04:18:30 <musasabi> you only need to be very carefull(tm)
04:18:55 <shapr> musasabi: yes, I agree... and you need to build some arrow optimizations into GHC :-)
04:19:11 <musasabi> well since I was not considering arrows ;)
04:19:13 <shapr> srid: no, YAHT is by Hal Daume, Haskell itself was designed by several people.
04:20:07 <musasabi> devicedrivers don't need fancy monads/arrows most of the time.
04:20:17 <shapr> What downsides exist other than space leaks?
04:20:46 <shapr> Haskell doesn't have a really good way to serialize values, which makes it hard to do easy distributed processing.
04:21:09 <shapr> None of the implementations support unicode, even though the standard requires unicode support.
04:21:29 <shapr> Anything I missed?
04:21:39 <musasabi> shapr: 1) serializing 2) strings 3) typeclass implementation 4) lack of libraries
04:21:50 <shapr> 4 is changing
04:21:53 <musasabi> yes.
04:22:00 <shapr> what do you mean with 3?
04:22:05 <musasabi> 3 will probably need a language extension.
04:22:17 <shapr> 2 is a good point, but I think that's an implementation problem.
04:22:21 <musasabi> shapr: the lack of local / scoped class instances
04:22:23 <tuomov> superclasses?
04:22:25 <shapr> I'm not sure what to do about 1
04:22:42 <shapr> Oh, inability to hide instances? Yah, that's a wart.
04:22:50 <musasabi> shapr: you could abuse parallel haskell code for that.
04:23:45 <shapr> In conclusion of the downsides discussion, Haskell has surprisingly few problems.
04:23:46 <musasabi> it contains a serializer.
04:23:58 <shapr> oh, it does? Does that code come with GHC?
04:24:03 <musasabi> yes.
04:24:11 <shapr> !
04:24:18 <musasabi> to add a small thing, thread local values would be nice.
04:24:25 <dblhelix> do we consider the dominance of ghc problematic from a language point of view? I mean, with all extensions, ghc is the de facto platform for haskell programming
04:25:21 <shapr> I think hugs is popular, if not as popular as GHC. NHC is still used. uu.nl is writing their own implementation too
04:28:55 <musasabi> ghc/rts/parallel/Pack.c etc
04:28:55 <musasabi> dblhelix: that is not a large problem - see e.g. python/perl/ruby/java
04:28:55 <shapr> I think GHC dominance would be a problem if it killed off all the other implementations.
04:28:55 <srid> as a n00b, i would like to know whether haskell is a static or dynamic language?
04:28:55 <dblhelix> srid: wrt typing?
04:28:55 <srid> i guess in former case, haskell must be faster than python, ...
04:28:55 <srid> dblhelix: yes
04:28:55 <dblhelix> srid: 100% static
04:28:55 <srid> like C or Python?
04:28:55 <tuomov> like neither
04:28:55 <shapr> ohh, my unicycle pants are dry... yay! I'm outta here.
04:28:55 <dblhelix> shapr: have fun :)
04:28:55 <shapr> :-)
04:28:55 <tuomov> statically typed but with automagic type inference so you do not need signatures
04:28:55 <tuomov> and no unsafe casts like in C
04:29:21 <dblhelix> although I personally consider it good style to always write explicit type signatures: types guide the coding
04:29:27 <musasabi> tuomov: actually there are unsafe casts if you really really want them.
04:30:09 <musasabi> named unsafeSomethingICannotRemember
04:30:29 <dblhelix> musasabi: unsafeCast?
04:30:46 <dblhelix> @type GHC.Base.unsafeCast#
04:30:50 <lambdabot> bzzt
04:30:52 <TheHunter> @index unsafeCoerce
04:30:52 <lambdabot> bzzt
04:31:05 <dblhelix> TheHunter: that's the one :)
04:31:06 <musasabi> the thing that is used to implement safe casting for dynamics
04:31:17 <dblhelix> @index unsafeCoerce#
04:31:17 <lambdabot> bzzt
04:31:20 <srid> @lisp
04:31:20 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "lisp", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
04:34:04 <dblhelix> anyway, while operationally just the identity function, its type is forall a b . a -> b
04:34:24 <musasabi> that is 
04:34:34 <musasabi> (sorry irssi history)
04:35:08 <dblhelix> and you don't want to use it (except for some very good reasons, like implementing dynamics or an approach for generic programming)
04:35:51 <srid> guess, i better learn Lisp first, then haskell .. but i need to wait for PCL
04:36:29 <dblhelix> srid: why would you start with lisp? weren't we convincing enough? ;)
04:37:13 <kosmikus> srid: if at all, I'd learn Scheme first
04:37:40 <dblhelix> kosmikus: why?
04:37:42 <kosmikus> but List/Scheme and Haskell are completely different languages, perhaps more so than C and Pascal
04:37:51 <kosmikus> dblhelix: because :)
04:38:08 <dblhelix> kosmikus: not sure if I'm buying that :)
04:38:10 <kosmikus> s/List/Lisp/, of course
04:38:24 <dblhelix> I learned
04:38:50 <dblhelix> Haskell as my first fp and was very happy with it from day one
04:39:05 * musasabi has used scheme and cl and does not want to go back
04:39:10 <dblhelix> that's ofcourse not a good reason, but still :)
04:39:30 <srid_> lisp syntax is simple and single, that's why thinking of learning it first
04:39:56 <tuomov> the syntax is _too_ simple
04:40:05 <musasabi> syntax is a very small part of a language
04:40:27 <musasabi> after two weeks you wont care about it much..
04:40:29 <srid_> lisp looks like a mother of all FP langs
04:40:38 <dblhelix> I always thought the designers of lisp never cared to develop a concrete syntax :)
04:40:40 <tuomov> brainfuck has a simple syntax
04:40:46 <kosmikus> dblhelix: maybe we misunderstood each other; of course you should learn Haskell first
04:41:03 <kosmikus> but if you absolutely don't want to learn Haskell, I'd prefer Scheme over Lisp
04:41:16 <dblhelix> kosmikus: ah, okay
04:41:39 <tuomov> MegaMonad: what do you think of brainfuck?
04:41:45 <MegaMonad> tuomov: I to do so well, show me it is unknown to the same thing...come to think of brainfuck?
04:41:57 <dblhelix> kosmikus: then we agree :)
04:44:07 <kosmikus> srid: did you learn Fortran first, only because it is the "mother of all procedural languages"?
04:49:58 <dblhelix> kosmikus: have you had a look at the str- and ep-algorithms for the bp view?
04:50:04 * srid_ is slightly confused .. may be he will start with haskell .. 
04:50:20 <dblhelix> srid_: at least you can take a hint ;)
04:50:59 <srid_> is YAHT complete, i.e. without missing any details?
04:51:23 <dblhelix> kosmikus: for the most part I maintained you notation; I only turned the str and ep parts into mathcal-prefixes, reserving room for the view designation
04:52:17 <srid_> i fear whether i would convince myself to learn lisp after knowing haskell
04:53:48 <tuomov> I don't bother learning lisp, but I'm sure I could learn it well enough in a couple of days if I needed it
04:56:20 <musasabi> actually learning common lisp well is hard because the library is enormous
04:59:56 <kosmikus> dblhelix: no, sorry, didn't look at it
05:00:05 <kosmikus> dblhelix: I've been quite busy hacking GH
05:02:33 <dblhelix> kosmikus: got rid of the kind-indexed types already?
05:02:44 <pesco> Hello hello.
05:03:04 <kosmikus> dblhelix: I don't plan to remove them completely; but they're no longer
05:03:07 <kosmikus> needed
05:13:58 <asmodai> w00t
05:14:02 <asmodai> job interview next week
05:16:59 <Itkovian> good luck!
05:17:43 <Itkovian> anybody here knows of bin-packing (2d) stuff programmed in haskell?
05:19:45 <Lemmih> bin-packing?
05:21:34 <Itkovian> yeah, where one has a number of 2d rectangles and tries to fit them in as few 2d 'bins' (also rectangles)
05:21:40 <Itkovian> as possible
05:38:45 <dblhelix> I guess you guys have already seen this one, but: http://www.malevole.com/mv/misc/killerquiz/ (not sure if it's liked by everybody, but ...)
05:40:29 <kosmikus> dblhelix: did that a long time ago, and I remember that I was quite bad
05:41:19 <dblhelix> kosmikus: scored 6/10, gives me a slight uncomfortable feeling
05:41:57 <Itkovian> 6/10 for me as well
05:42:06 <Itkovian> is did find the haskell guy tho!
05:42:07 <Itkovian> :-)
05:42:12 <Itkovian> s/is/I/
05:44:01 <tuomov> 3/10!
05:44:11 <dblhelix> tuomov: ouch
05:46:01 * wli really wants to figure out how to do the things he's interested in doing that ppl say darcs can do at some point
05:48:37 <shapr> man I love unicyling.
05:49:18 <musasabi> isn't there ice outside?
05:49:35 <Igloo> kosmikus: I'm sure it's there, but there are other problems that might cause segfaults
05:49:39 <shapr> and deep snow, and a frozen lake, and ...
05:50:19 <shapr> musasabi: perfect for realy stretching my mountain unicycling skills without needing to leave the flatland outside my door.
05:52:39 <musasabi> shapr: I stopped cycling for the winter because it was getting too dangerous.
05:52:56 <musasabi> (or then I would have to go so slowly that the bus is faster)
05:53:02 <tuomov> I always cycle through winter
05:53:15 <tuomov> only in the <=-10C days I walk
05:54:02 <musasabi> tuomov: are you using winter tires?
05:54:03 <shapr> I have a steel frame, spiked pedals, three inch tire, etc. all designed for use in mud, gravel, and any other crazy terrain you can find.
05:54:06 <tuomov> musasabi: no
05:54:17 <tuomov> but then, I don't leave hervanta with the cycle
05:54:21 <shapr> I wish I could find a Nokia Gazzaloddi three inch tire, but they're so rare :-(
05:54:36 <tuomov> mostly I go from home to grocery shop (and work if I had a job)
05:54:47 <tuomov> everything at most 1km from one another
05:54:55 <shapr> I also wish I could get the Large Marge 65mm rim in 24 inch, but they only make 26 inch right now.
05:55:15 <Igloo> kosmikus: Also, what arch is it segfaulting on? If sparc I think I have a tweak to the fix
05:55:35 <musasabi> tuomov: you live in Hervanta?
05:55:40 <tuomov> unfortunately
05:55:48 <musasabi> (normally I cycle from Otaniemi to Kumpula)
05:56:04 <musasabi> hmm I have visited the place quite a few times :-)
05:56:19 <shapr> I have the largest mass produced rim as well, 38.4mm
05:56:37 <shapr> I am a unicycle geek!
05:57:29 <tuomov> I really really want to move out of hervanta, but first I should figure out what I want to start doing next
05:57:29 * shapr doubts this is news to anyone
05:57:40 <tuomov> 6 years here is enough
05:57:53 <shapr> Move to Boden! We have... um.. military!
05:58:18 * musasabi is quite happy in Otaniemi
05:58:31 <tuomov> we gave ummm.. a concrete jungle
05:58:43 <musasabi> nice large cheap apartment, friends and nature near..
05:59:19 <tuomov> nature's near... hervanta is like a huge lump of concrete in the middle of forest
06:00:18 <musasabi> yes, I remember walking from Hervanta to an another part of Tampere few years ago..
06:00:23 <tuomov> one of the most annoying things is that there aren't many decent places to eat
06:00:29 <Itkovian> shapr: are you in this: http://gallery.unicyclist.com/albums/albuu21/U2trailer.mov ?
06:00:34 <tuomov> it's all just pizza, kebab and hamburger
06:00:50 <musasabi> (We had slept at TTY and had to go to fetch some things)
06:00:51 <shapr> Itkovian: no movies of me sadly. I don't have a camera.
06:01:04 <Itkovian> shapr: well, you definitely have to check these guys out
06:01:11 <shapr> Itkovian: I do have a nice collection of unifilms here: http://thunderbird.scannedinavian.com/~shae/unifilms/
06:01:35 <shapr> I have about 600mb of unifilms, including that one.
06:01:58 <shapr> I'm even now sending out emails to try to host bittorrents for higher quality versions of Yoggi's films.
06:02:10 <shapr> this is my favorite - http://thunderbird.scannedinavian.com/~shae/unifilms/11_Au_TAQUET_10Mo.wmv
06:02:26 <shapr> but now, it's time for arm exercise and sauna
06:02:37 <shapr> min√§ haluan saunaa!
06:03:02 <Itkovian> if its porn, I'll direct my boss to you :-)
06:03:33 * musasabi wants sauna too, but has to wait 4 hours
06:03:45 <Itkovian> hmm ... player doesn't seem to get anything ...
06:04:27 * Itkovian is wgetting it now ...
06:16:05 <Itkovian> nice!

06:56:42 <Itkovian> I'm off ...
06:56:46 <Itkovian> have a good weekend
07:16:48 <srid> how old is haskell ?
07:17:01 <musasabi> The standard is from 98.
07:17:02 <kristnjov> old
07:17:12 <srid> 1998 then
07:17:17 <musasabi> but it existed before that in many forms.
07:17:20 <kristnjov> john hughes has an efnet channel on efnet.. #hughes
07:17:22 <kristnjov> you could ask him
07:17:48 <bourbaki> how do i make sure that functions in instances dont count as multiple definitions of functions?
07:18:08 <kristnjov> rename the functions
07:18:49 <bringert> bourbaki: they shouldn't
07:18:55 <Lemmih> bourbaki: Use correct indentation.
07:19:21 <bourbaki> http://paste.phpfi.com/40523
07:19:36 <kristnjov> NOOO classes, i hate em!
07:19:50 <bringert> bourbaki: is that the original indentation?
07:20:03 <bourbaki> yes
07:20:16 <bringert> then your problem is, as Lemmih said, indentation
07:20:27 <bourbaki> and what is the right indention?
07:20:51 <bringert> the function declarations in class and instance declarations must be indented more than the class/instance head
07:20:54 <Lemmih> kristnjov: Type classes are very spiffy IMHO.
07:21:10 <kristnjov> nim
07:21:12 <kristnjov> = not in mine
07:21:22 <bringert> and you can do type level programming with them
07:21:41 <bringert> awful syntax and very cumbersome
07:21:43 <bringert> but cool
07:22:16 <Lemmih> Haskell without typeclasses with be _very_ limiting.
07:22:47 <Darius> Haskell without typeclasses would be very boring.
07:22:47 <bourbaki> ok sec let me try
07:23:36 <musasabi> I don't use type classes very much.
07:23:40 <Lemmih> s/with be/would be/
07:24:13 <Lemmih> musasabi: Don't use numbers, eh?
07:24:23 <Darius> musasabi: I don't seem to create my own all that much either, but I still would not want them removed.
07:24:26 <musasabi> local/nested instances would help a lot.
07:24:31 <musasabi> Darius: true.
07:25:01 <Darius> They are also one of the distinguishing features of Haskell.  I think the only other language that has them is Mercury and it stole them from Haskell.
07:25:16 <musasabi> most of the time I end up creating records containing functions rather than typeclasses since they are first class unlike type classes.
07:25:51 * aleator hopes that mercury would have stolen the syntax also..
07:26:17 <tromp> without typeclasses you cldn't work well with mutable arrays
07:26:19 <Lemmih> bourbaki: How's it going?
07:26:47 <musasabi> typeclasses + serialization are just not very nice.
07:27:07 <bourbaki> Lemmih: good good thanks
07:27:29 <bourbaki> is there a function that kicks out doubles out of lists?
07:27:31 <Darius> aleator: You wish? or you're wondering?  Mercury has syntax inspired by logic languages.
07:27:43 <bourbaki> [1, 1, 2, 3] |-> [1,2,3]
07:27:58 <Darius> nub
07:27:58 <musasabi> bourbaki: what about sorting?
07:28:06 <Lemmih> @type Data.List.nub
07:28:08 <lambdabot> Data.List.nub :: forall a. (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]
07:28:28 <musasabi> is nub equal to "map head (group lst)" ?
07:28:37 <Darius> I don't think so.
07:28:38 <bourbaki> sorting and then?
07:28:50 <tromp> nub doesn't sort
07:28:55 <Darius> It doesn't need sorting.
07:29:23 <aleator> Dariues: Well, I just found writing mercury a pain. It is a nice language but looks rather foul. 
07:29:39 <tromp> 'nub equals that only for lists whose eql members occur in groups
07:29:54 <Darius> aleator:  I haven't played with Mercury, but, yes, the syntax does look ugly as sin.
07:30:57 <bourbaki> ok what does nub do?
07:31:38 <Lemmih> nub [1, 2, 3, 1] = [1, 2, 3]
07:31:49 <bourbaki> ah ok
07:32:16 <bourbaki> what was the include equivalent again?
07:32:25 <Darius> import?
07:32:25 <bourbaki> import?
07:32:35 <Lemmih> @index nub
07:32:35 <lambdabot> Data.List,List
07:33:37 <Lemmih> lambdabot: You are a nice bot. I can barely wait till Cabal/Hackage gets mature.
07:33:37 <lambdabot> Sorry, I'm not a very smart bot yet, try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
07:34:40 <Darius> @get-definition nubBy
07:34:41 <lambdabot> nubBy = \eq l.if null l then [] else head l : nubBy eq (filter (\x.not 
07:34:41 <lambdabot> x `eq` head l)) (tail l))
07:43:11 <tuomov> I'm blinded.
07:43:18 <shapr> by the light?
07:43:23 <tuomov> Took a look at mercury.
07:43:30 <shapr> oh
07:43:49 <shapr> mercury syntax is ... not very sexy.
07:45:27 <bringert> @get-definition undefined
07:45:28 <lambdabot> undefined = undefined
07:53:17 <srid> well, i am going to study haskell .. convinced!
07:53:23 <shapr> yay!
07:53:27 <shapr> How can we help you study?
07:53:53 <shapr> hiya Rich_M
07:53:56 <Rich_M> hey
07:54:01 <shapr> how's code treating you?
07:54:05 <srid> shapr: I hope YAHT would suffice for a python programmer (who never programmed in FP)
07:54:12 <Rich_M> pretty good thanks, except for this one thing
07:54:24 <shapr> srid: if it doesn't you can ask me, and I can explain in terms of python.
07:54:28 <shapr> @wiki HaskellDemo
07:54:28 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
07:54:45 <shapr> That's the "first one is free" demo doc.
07:54:45 <srid> and I did see the Queen.hs example that came with hugs. Excellent!
07:54:52 <Rich_M> what does this mean please?: Instance of Num [Char] required for definition of sumA
07:55:07 <shapr> sounds like you're trying to add two strings together.
07:55:21 <shapr> or subtract one string from another, or multiply one string by another.
07:55:23 <shapr> something like that.
07:56:06 <shapr> It's saying that you're using a Numeric operation on something that isn't Numeric.
07:56:26 <shapr> Specifically, you're using a Numeric operation on a list of characters, which is how a string is defined.
07:56:35 <Rich_M> oh right, that was it, thanks!
07:58:01 <Rich_M> by the way, i've seen my lecturer use the '@' symbol but I don't understand it's use...?
07:58:20 <shapr> it's usually used to bind something while you're doing pattern matching.
07:58:28 <shapr> Do you know pattern matching already?
07:59:26 <Rich_M> yeah think so, all the different ways a function can happen
07:59:37 <shapr> something like that, yeah
08:00:22 <Rich_M> =)
08:00:56 <shapr> anyway
08:01:16 <shapr> if you use a type constructor to do pattern matching, you can name some chunks while you're doing that.
08:01:32 <shapr> myFoo all@(Something x) = x + 1
08:01:53 <shapr> that way you can bind the whole argument to all, and the value inside a Something constructor to x
08:01:56 <shapr> you can nest those too
08:02:13 <shapr> myFoo all@(SomethingWicked dalist@(x:xs)) = x + 1
08:02:32 <shapr> I don't use that, because I think it's hard to read.
08:03:27 <bourbaki> bk
08:03:32 <shapr> darcs!
08:03:43 <bourbaki> i found some cool papers on graphs and CT
08:03:44 <shapr> Rich_M: what do you think? hard to read? or clear once you understand it?
08:06:03 <Rich_M> still seems rticky
08:06:06 <Rich_M> tricky
08:20:24 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: Good morning!  I feel like mapping and sequencing you!
08:20:30 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: How can i pretty much similar to mapping can be used for sequencing.
08:25:04 <aleator> On the topic of ugly syntax, I was just forced to write: 
08:25:06 <aleator>                                                                       
08:25:25 <aleator> agg::conv_stroke<agg::conv_transform<agg::conv_curve<agg::path_storage> > > stroke(trc);
08:25:53 <aleator> quite funny one.
08:26:08 <vegai> what's that?
08:26:13 <vegai> C++?
08:26:22 <aleator> yup.
08:26:32 <vegai> indeed.
08:26:59 <ibid> it can be beautified :)
08:27:03 <aleator> The funny part is - this is a really good c++ library. :)
08:27:23 <vegai> "stroke" is the punchline there :)
08:28:49 <aleator> ibid: by lots of typedefs?
08:29:07 <ibid> don't need lots of them :)
08:29:20 <ibid> one or two
08:29:36 <ibid> and it usually makes sense even when not considerig the beautifying effect
08:30:20 <aleator> Ah, but that is not that helpful, since the type is used just once.
08:30:50 <Darius> What about components of the type?
08:31:05 <aleator> nope.
08:31:54 <ibid> you can also break that into several lines
08:32:16 <aleator> Yeah.. but still :)
08:37:15 <CosmicRay> hey ibid
08:37:32 <ibid> hey :)
08:49:19 <Nioate> is there an efficient way to dump an abstract datatype to disk, to be reloaded later?
08:49:41 <musasabi> There are nice and evil ways.
08:49:45 <ibid> _abstract_ datatype?
08:50:00 <ibid> a portable but not fast way is to use Show and Read
08:50:03 <musasabi> (I am thinking he means just a plain data)
08:50:07 <Nioate> yeah
08:50:22 <musasabi> Show and Read is quite slow for real apps, good for prototyping though.
08:50:52 <musasabi> you can use Binary or just write optimized serialization functions for your types.
08:50:54 <ibid> nhc iirc has a binary data serialization library 
08:51:06 <ibid> or is it now in hierarchicals too?
08:51:07 <musasabi> there is a port for GHC of that.
08:51:25 <musasabi> not in the hierarchical libs but as an addon part.
08:51:27 <Darius> To tick or not to tick?
08:55:47 * shapr watches Darius carefully
08:56:10 <shapr> Maybe that's just a minute difference?
08:56:29 <shapr> That might be exact enough for hour purposes.
08:56:42 <vegai> Darius: played Kohan? :P
08:57:03 <shapr> Darius: I second that.
08:57:38 <shapr> I feeling shy and timed today.
08:57:48 <shapr> ok, that last one was a little late.

09:00:32 <shapr> you mean, which jokes?
09:01:36 <shapr> xerox: Darius said to tick or not to tick, so I *watch*ed him carefully? then there was a *minute* difference? and *hour* purposes? or what about I *second* that?
09:01:57 * xerox shrugs
09:02:02 <shapr> wasn't funny?

09:05:06 <boegel> hey, that's nice...
09:05:10 <boegel> could be handy
09:06:43 <xerox> definitely.
09:07:06 <shapr> @seen wli
09:07:06 <lambdabot> wli is in #darcs and #haskell.
09:07:22 <boegel> have you guys seen this ? : http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html
09:07:28 <Darius> xerox: That's great.
09:07:31 <shapr> yah, it's great
09:07:34 <xerox> indeed.
09:07:44 <shapr> I met Fritz at ICFP also. He has a very sharp sense of humor in person.
09:08:01 <Darius> boegel: Probably most people here have seen it.
09:08:12 <shapr> Have you seen the t-shirts made by the same guy?
09:08:33 <boegel> shapr: no
09:08:39 <shapr> I hope Fritz comes to the next ICFP in Estonia, I'm aiming for that.
09:08:53 * Darius was bored one day so he rederived the ideas from "Recursion Schemes from Comonads"
09:09:05 <shapr> yow
09:10:51 <xerox> http://www.google.com/ac.js
09:11:10 <shapr> smooth
09:11:19 <xerox> Readable.
09:11:58 <shapr> Man, I want syntax highlighting in Yi 
09:12:18 <xerox> Write it!
09:12:23 <shapr> should I use sdf2haskell?
09:12:26 <shapr> what's the best approach?
09:12:40 <xerox> Who knows :-|
09:12:45 <Philippa_> is there an established interface for saying "render these bits in these colours"?
09:12:56 <Philippa_> if not, sorting that out probably makes a good start
09:13:34 <Philippa_> if you really want a chance for some mental masturbation, do the styles/content markup thing
09:13:47 <Philippa_> (it'll prolly be needed in the end anyway)
09:14:52 <Lunar^> shapr: Saw dons lately ?
09:15:35 <shapr> @seen dons
09:15:36 <lambdabot> dons is in #haskell.
09:15:59 <Philippa_> you need an @spoken or something
09:16:05 <shapr> yeah, true
09:16:07 <Lunar^> shapr: I was wondering if he said anything about the undo lib recently posted on Mls
09:16:09 <Darius> There is /whois
09:16:21 <Philippa_> only works if you're on the same server usually
09:16:39 <boegel> Philippa_: or @active
09:16:58 <shapr> ok, assume I want parser based modes in Yi rather than regex-based anything
09:17:07 <boegel> Darius, /whois is not for each channel
09:17:32 <vegai> does Yi have "syntax awareness" yet?
09:17:37 <shapr> How can I easily build per-language parsers for features like syntax highlighting, intelligent completion, etc
09:17:38 <shapr> no, not yet
09:17:44 <vegai> ok
09:17:57 <shapr> But that's what I want.
09:17:57 <Philippa_> shapr: Parsec! (or a bastardisation thereof)
09:18:02 <Philippa_> (yes, I'm being sarky)
09:18:05 <Darius> boegel:  Well if the person has spoken recently on any channel then they likely were at their computer and will noticed being mentioned on another.
09:18:27 <boegel> Darius: maybe they're just not following each channel... :p
09:18:28 <shapr> Darius: but, /ctcp ping also zeros the idle time
09:18:39 <shapr> there's SDF2Haskell
09:18:52 <shapr> um, what other options? bnfc?
09:18:53 <Philippa_> shapr: intelligent completion's the hard bit. Things like syntax highlighting, you pipe the parser output into some Renderable markup
09:19:09 <Darius> boegel:  Don't most IRC clients signal in some way when one's name is spoken (if configured that way)?
09:19:29 <boegel> Darius: true
09:19:30 <Darius> shapr: In my whoising, that hasn't seemed like such a problem.
09:19:32 <boegel> you have me there :p
09:20:28 <Darius> shapr:  You could just have the interface require a stream of (token,color) pairs, and leave how that stream is made up to the plugin.
09:20:58 <Philippa_> you probably want more general than that so you can do code folding, but same difference to an extent
09:21:08 <tuomov> colouring should be separate from the syntax description
09:21:12 <Philippa_> (in that the interface still just spits out markup)
09:21:24 <Philippa_> tuomov: styles/content markup, like I said
09:21:44 <Darius> tuomov: It can be as separate as it wants.  The plugin writer can write it however they want.
09:22:02 <tuomov> an alternative UI could choose to use different kind of highlighting
09:22:15 <shapr> I'd like to have a semi-standard parser so that I can develop incremental parsing, and a standard way to do parse tree macros in Yi
09:22:21 <tuomov> so converting syntax description to colours or whatever belongs on the ui side
09:22:35 <Philippa_> shapr: yeah. I suspect there's going to need to be a bit of exploratory hacking to see what the parser really needs to do
09:23:16 <Philippa_> though odds are in practice everybody's going to put the parser output through some minor filter to get the bits they want when they start work anyway
09:23:30 <shapr> I'm tempted to start out using the ATerm format and SDF2Haskell because they alreday work together in the MetaEnvironment
09:24:18 <Philippa_> (eg it'd be nice to have access to a list of parse errors for the entire text so you can do the VS.net thing, similarly when that works you can then start background type-checking...)
09:24:22 <tuomov> theory of buffers framework handles incremental parsing etc.
09:24:42 <tuomov> and it could also delay things where wanted
09:24:50 <shapr> right, incremental type-checking a la epigram would be really handy
09:24:52 <Philippa_> point, I /really/ ought to follow just WTF's been going on so far
09:24:54 <shapr> or even just type slicing
09:25:28 <shapr> but, what are the existing options? I don't want to write my own
09:25:58 <tuomov> I think it would be best to first come up with an abstract transformation chain
09:26:11 <tuomov> even if it needs to be changed later on
09:26:36 <tuomov> then hack some - any - parser to work within that framework
09:26:41 <shapr> I think it's best to have something that sort of works and figure out the abstraction from that
09:27:30 <Philippa_> buffer -> basic parser output -> <frig for content -> <plug-in info| render ->display> | info for other plug-ins> makes sense to me?
09:27:54 <tuomov> you may want to use many parsers (literate programming, cpp)
09:28:05 <tuomov> folds could be another transformation in the chain
09:28:06 <tuomov> and so on
09:28:32 <Philippa_> yeah, so you have a possible branch immediately outside basic parser output with all the same possibilities from there
09:28:50 <Philippa_> I suspect the render/display bit should probably just count as yet another plug-in
09:28:57 <shapr> to the parser framework?
09:29:00 <Philippa_> so really the question is who decides where it gets plugged in
09:29:07 <Philippa_> to the transformation chain
09:29:39 <tuomov> have you read my theory of buffers post on the post-emacs ml?
09:29:43 <Philippa_> nope
09:29:51 <Philippa_> subject line?
09:29:58 <tuomov> theory of buffers, iirc
09:30:58 <Philippa_> I suspect reality is that we do our configuration by way of a small typed compositional language, IYSWIM
09:31:22 <Philippa_> (we're probably thinking on similar lines)
09:31:47 <marcot> Hello, how can I convert int to float to found what's the percentage of an integer with respect to another.
09:31:49 <marcot> ?
09:32:00 <marcot> like percent 2 12 = 16.6667
09:32:41 <Darius> @type fromIntegral
09:32:42 <lambdabot> fromIntegral :: forall b a. (Num b, Integral a) => a -> b
09:33:20 <Darius> @type (/)
09:33:21 <lambdabot> (/) :: forall a. (Fractional a) => a -> a -> a
09:33:25 <marcot> Darius: thanks.
09:33:29 <tuomov> Philippa_: in a sense, yes
09:34:14 <Philippa_> reading the post, I see you've banged your head briefly on the whole "we're dealing with transformations but need an explicit source point" thing
09:34:31 <Philippa_> well, not really banged your head on, but I always found that to be an ugly bit, y'know?
09:34:48 <tuomov> eh?
09:35:38 <Darius> f . g. h $ x
09:35:46 <tuomov> subsuming the primitive transformations into the plaintext at bottom?
09:35:59 <Philippa_> you've got PrimTrans as an "inject data" transformation, basically
09:36:21 <Philippa_> when all the data is sorta present at the start - we're not doing something stateful the way darcs is, it makes less sense IYSWIM?
09:36:34 <Oeje1> tuomov: Where can I find an archive of post Emacs?
09:36:47 <tuomov> http://lists.scannedinavian.org/pipermail/post-emacs/
09:38:13 <Oeje1> tuomov: Thanks! :-)
09:39:35 <shapr> seems the discussion has moved off of post-emacs and mostly happens on #haskell
09:39:48 <tuomov> so it seems
09:40:12 <shapr> in any case, what existing code/libs can I use to get this parser/synax highlighting/whatever?
09:40:43 <Philippa_> god knows. (ab)use parsec to do the parsing and hack something temporary up, I reckon
09:40:50 <Philippa_> 'sfine to branch for experiments, y'know?
09:41:08 <Philippa_> not to mention it gives us something more concrete to flame^Wargue about
09:41:35 <tuomov> Philippa_: I don't really see how there's any difference wrt. state, but we would have two different kinds of patches if we look at the framework as commuting patches.. but rename a few things and we just have a chain of transformations passing events around
09:42:07 <Philippa_> yeah, am reading more of the post, ISWYM
09:43:05 <shapr> I'd like to make it easy for the users to define their own modes, whether or not they can write Haskell.
09:43:08 <Philippa_> ICBW, the 'chain of transformations/events' view seems to make more sense to me though
09:43:15 <shapr> That's why I was thinking about SDF or BNFC
09:43:20 <Philippa_> shapr: wait 'til we have something then write a combinator lib?
09:44:06 <Philippa_> I mean, if you don't give a damn about the 80 character thing, writing out transformer chains in Haskell can be done in a very intuitive manner indeed...
09:44:15 <tuomov> writing a parser for a language doesn't seem "easy" to me
09:44:31 <tuomov> no matter what the parser library
09:44:40 <Philippa_> perhaps, but that should be the only issue
09:44:51 <Philippa_> (Parsec /does/ make things pretty easy IMO so long as you've got a grammar definition to hand)
09:45:49 <Philippa_> IMO it should at least be the case that where there's a clear grammar you can write a mode largely by translating between two metalanguages (which're going to be pretty similar in practice)
09:55:45 <shapr> I was thinking that something like visual-re-builder in emacs would make it much easier to build language parsers.
09:56:38 <shapr> With re-builder, you incrementally build your regex in a buffer of a few lines. As the regex changes, each part that matches is highlighted in a different color in the other buffer.
09:56:59 <shapr> Epigram takes that even further, but I'm not completely sure how to apply that to parser building.
09:57:16 <tuomov> epigram has a special editor?
09:57:23 <shapr> uh, no
09:57:30 <shapr> it just a has really cool interface
09:58:00 <Philippa_> "nothing needs its own editor, it can just patch the hell out of emacs"?
09:58:02 <shapr> With epigram, you incrementally code/type/etc your program.
09:58:36 <shapr> I'd like to be able to build my language parser one declaration at a time
09:58:58 <tuomov> bleah. no deb.
09:59:04 <shapr> then I could write just as much of the parser as I need for synhl first, and later for intelligent completion and parse tree macros
09:59:07 <Philippa_> yeah, any sensible parser's going to need a default "many thingsThatDon'tMakeSense" case
10:05:25 * shapr tries to build DrIFT
10:07:28 <shapr> Anyone else able to build DrIFT 2.1.0 ?
10:07:41 <shapr> oh, it seems to be building now
10:12:20 <shapr> yay, now I only need to have Strafunski
10:12:53 <retardo> I am just learning to write class and instance declarations, and I have not been able to figure out how to write the declaration I want. My short code is at: http://sial.org/pbot/5974
10:13:14 <shapr> retardo: have you seen the HaskellDemo on the wiki?
10:13:34 <retardo> No.  I don't see it mentioned in the /topic; where is the haskell demo?
10:13:52 <shapr> @wiki HaskellDemo
10:13:52 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
10:16:05 <retardo> Thanks, but that doesn't help much.  The example is too simple for me.
10:16:47 <shapr> hm, I'm not sure about that.
10:16:52 <CosmicRay> retardo: I don't know exactly how to answer your question, but this may be helpful: http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/
10:17:06 <shapr> retardo: your instance has the pieces in the wrong places
10:17:20 <retardo> shapr: Yes, I know.
10:17:30 <retardo> shapr: That's why I'm asking for help.
10:17:43 <retardo> CosmicRay: Thanks; I'm looking.
10:17:45 <shapr> Have you successfully made your own class and instance?
10:18:10 <retardo> Only for monoclasses.
10:18:48 <shapr> monoclasses?
10:19:35 <retardo> CosmicRay: This is a really useful resource, and I am looking forward to reading it, but it helps me with the other end of my problem.  I am trying to implement a certain behavior in Haskell.   I already have a working implementation in SML.  My problem is with the haskell end of things.  Your useful reference helps me with the implementation, which is not a problem right now.
10:19:57 <shapr> What is your question?
10:20:27 <CosmicRay> retardo: perhaps you could take a step back and discuss what it is you're trying to do.  It may be that a state monad isn't the best way to solve it.
10:20:28 <shapr> You want to make an instance of a class, right?
10:20:54 <retardo> shapr: I want to define an instance of Monad m  in which the underlying data is a pair containing a monad and a State.  What is the syntax for doing that in Haskell?
10:21:17 <shapr> The same as the syntax for the typeclasses on the HaskellDemo
10:21:23 <retardo> No, sorry, the pair contains a value of type m and a State. 
10:22:07 <shapr> Also, the nomaware tutorial that CosmicRay suggested does declare State monad instances, so it probably will help you.
10:23:19 <retardo> That would probably help me accomplish my short-term goal of getting the code working.  But it would be suboptimal for my larger goal, which is to understand the idea of monads better by implementing some instances from scratch.
10:23:34 <shapr> In that case, you should read the nomaware tutorial.
10:25:03 <Darius> retardo: 1) You should provide the error message you are getting, 2) I don't believe one is allowed to have instances be type synonyms in standard Haskell 3) you haven't given a definition for Mon
10:25:35 <retardo> When I say "instance MyMon Monad", why does it say that Monad is an undefined type constructor?   
10:25:53 <shapr> because, you have the pieces in the wrong place.
10:25:54 <Darius> Because Monad isn't a type constructor.
10:26:11 <retardo> It's a class constructor?
10:26:31 <Darius> It's a type class (or a constructor class to be more specific)
10:26:33 <retardo> Oh, it's  "instance Class Tycon".
10:27:31 <Darius> But "Monad" is nowhere in the code you posted, so I can't tell you what's wrong.
10:27:53 <CosmicRay> retardo: you may also find this useful: http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/
10:27:55 <retardo> Part of my problem is that I ridiculously put "Mon" instead of Monad".
10:28:04 <shapr> like I said in the first place :-)
10:28:13 <retardo> So let's abandon that code, I'll go away and thing about the references you gave me, and come back later if I have more questions.
10:28:13 <retardo> Thanks.
10:28:32 <shapr> nomaware really is the best thing going for monad tutorials.
10:28:39 <shapr> it's great!
10:29:01 <retardo> I really think I understand the idea very well right now, and that it would be counterproductive for me to see anyone else canned solutions.
10:29:06 <Darius> retardo: Things that are instances of Monad are type constructors not types, you have to apply it to a type to get a type.
10:29:15 <shapr> retardo: could you explain the idea then?
10:29:28 <retardo> I am looking forward to reading the nomaware tutorial, but not just now.
10:29:36 <retardo> shapr: Yes, I think I could.
10:29:49 <retardo> Like I said, I have a working SML implementation.
10:29:57 <shapr> do you have time to explain it? I'm always interested in how other people see monads.
10:30:08 <retardo> shapr: Sorry, I don't right now.
10:30:12 <shapr> ok
10:30:13 <retardo> But thanks for your interest.
10:30:34 <retardo> And thanks again for the references.
10:30:39 <shapr> new viewpoints are often powerful tools.
10:31:01 <shapr> anyway, there's something else past monads... arrows!
10:31:19 <retardo> Have you read Goldblatt's book on Toposes?
10:31:24 <shapr> nope
10:31:38 <retardo> I really enjoyed it.   I recommend it very highly.
10:31:42 <shapr> I assume that you're approach monads from the category theoretical perspective?
10:31:53 <retardo> No, more from a programming language perspective.
10:32:12 <shapr> my favorite view is from a software engineering perspective.
10:32:14 <retardo> But I've been delving into category theory a lot lately.
10:32:59 <shapr> I am amazed that such a simple structure can be so powerful.
11:01:38 <shapr> StrategyLib 4.0 builds! now I'm ready to build SDF2Haskell
11:01:41 * shapr hopes
11:01:52 <shapr> I will say, SDF2Haskell has a very large number of deps.
11:01:53 <Lunar^> shapr: What's StrategyLib ?
11:02:22 <shapr> it's part of Strafunski
11:02:32 <shapr> http://www.cs.vu.nl/Strafunski/
11:02:57 <stepcut> shapr!
11:03:01 <shapr> stepcut!
11:03:09 <stepcut> shapr: how is the yi-emacs keymaap coming along ?
11:03:32 <shapr> haven't done anything useful for it yet
11:03:35 <stepcut> heh
11:03:38 <stepcut> me neither :)
11:03:53 <shapr> I stared at the repitition code for Vim.hs, but it seems to work for numbers only
11:03:56 <stepcut> though, I did use the ctk lexer for a different project, so now I understand it aa bit better
11:05:40 <stepcut> hrm, for extra fun, I bet we could use TH to help construct the initial keymap :)
11:16:35 <shapr> hej chucky!
11:30:46 * shapr wibbles
11:33:03 <retardo> After   data AMon a = Tick (Integer -> (a, Integer)),   why can't I  do     instance Show AMon   ?   It says "illegal type in class constraint".
11:33:54 <Darius> AMon is a type constructor, not a type.  Show is a type class not a constructor class.
11:36:48 <retardo> I guess I don't understand why I can do   instance Monad AMon but not instance Show Amon.
11:37:07 <shapr> I want QuickCheck2 now! I don't want to wait!
11:37:07 <psi> hm, i always thought that (in this example) AMon is a new type, and Tick is the type contructor
11:37:09 <retardo> And why I can do instance Show Expr but not instance Show AMon.
11:37:15 <Darius> Monad is a constructor class (it takes type constructors), Show is a a type class it takes types.
11:37:17 <psi> what is Tick called?
11:37:33 <Darius> data constructor
11:37:41 <psi> ah, right
11:38:06 <retardo> I think we are closing in on my fundamental confusion.
11:38:15 <retardo> There are two different usages for "instance" declarations?
11:38:58 <retardo> One for constructor class / type constructor   pairs and one for type class / type pairs ?
11:40:24 <Darius> Theoretically, there's some difference, but conceptually there the same.  You're problem is that you are not providing the right kinds (kinds == types for types).  At the term level it would be analogous to you passing a higher order function (AMon) where a value is needed.
11:40:49 <Darius> It's just like in SML, you can't do f : list -> list.
11:42:09 <retardo> OK, I understand.  
11:42:13 <retardo> Light dawns.
11:42:37 <retardo> If I qualify the non-working declaration with a type context that says that AMon x will be a Show if x is also a show, will it be legal?
11:42:52 <asmodai> shapr: oh, so I am not the only one with those Check21 emails
11:43:05 <shapr> eh?
11:43:16 <Darius> If you change AMon to (AMon x), yes.
11:43:20 <Darius> (AMon x) is a type.
11:43:25 <retardo> Great, that's what I thought.  Thanks!
11:43:26 <asmodai> shapr: mmm, or I am confusing spam emails now
11:43:26 <shapr> Thoth-Amon!
11:43:32 <shapr> asmodai: oh, you mean tmda?
11:43:40 <asmodai> tmda?
11:43:41 <retardo> shapr: I keep thinking "AMon Ra" also.
11:44:23 <shapr> Thoth is the man.
11:44:32 <shapr> even if he gotta drink through a straw for eternity.
11:44:52 <shapr> I'd hate being called bird-brain throughout eternity, though I guess being the god of knowledge would make up for it.
11:45:39 <shapr> easy to hide too, just squat down on any lawn full of plastic flamingos.
11:47:25 * shapr grumbles at haterm
11:48:07 <shapr> guten abend Joachim
11:48:22 <retardo> shapr: He has a baboon form too.  He can eat solid food then.
11:49:32 <shapr> Oh, I think I remember reading about that. It's been a coupla decades since I last read about egyptian mythology.
11:50:53 <shapr> Nowadays I read research papers for fun.
11:53:04 <Darius> shapr: I'm sure there are some research papers on Egyptian mythology
11:53:13 <shapr> good point
11:53:19 <shapr> I was thinking about research papers on programming.
11:53:31 <shapr> Or on unicycling too :-)
11:53:52 <Darius> @flip
11:53:53 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "flip", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
11:54:05 <retardo> OK, I'm happy.  I got my first monad class implemented in Haskell, and it's working OK.  Thanks very much to tall of you who helped.
11:54:13 <shapr> "Abstract: A model of balancing upright on a unicycle has pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations, and describes riders from novice to expert with both good and not-so-good reactions."
11:55:09 <retardo> I would be grateful if you folks would be willing to take a look at it and to criticize it on syntactic grounds.  It looks to me like code that was written in Haskell by someone who knew SML a lot better than he knew Haskell.
11:55:21 <shapr> ohh, I'm really good at criticizing!
11:55:41 <Darius> What about more semantic things?
11:57:17 <retardo> That would be fine too, but I really hope we don't get into a big discussion of what you think I might really have meant to do.
11:57:46 <shapr> retardo: are you used to talking to Smerdyakov? ;-)
11:58:00 <retardo> I'm used to talking to people on IRC.
11:58:02 <shapr> ah
11:58:35 <shapr> I understand that.
11:58:43 <retardo> http://sial.org/pbot/5975
11:58:56 <shapr> Hey you weant to...! oh never mind...
11:59:07 * shapr snickers evilly
11:59:36 <retardo> I have just cut out the definition of (>>)
12:00:39 <Darius> The first thing: you probably meant to have State in the data declaration and not Integer.
12:01:01 <retardo> Or else I probably meant to cut out State entirely.
12:01:02 <retardo> Yeah.  Thanks.
12:01:23 <Darius> The first semantic thing: A Haskell programmer would probably use newtype rather than data.
12:01:30 <retardo> That was the result of a previous iteration in which I didn't correctly understand the message about "type synonym in instance head".
12:01:39 <retardo> Why newtype rather than data?
12:02:21 <Darius> newtype is purely a fiction of the type checker and has no run-time manifestation.  data actually adds an indirection.
12:02:48 <retardo> Oho.  SML optimizes away the indirection for types with only one constructor.
12:03:04 <Darius> The only difference meaning-wise is that with the data declaration there is one extra value, Tick _|_, whereas with newtype Tick _|_ = _|_
12:03:20 <Darius> retardo: That's because SML is eager.
12:03:50 <retardo> I see.  Are you allowed to use newtype to define a type with more than one constructor?
12:04:16 <Darius> No as newtype is just a wrapper around another type.  Anyways, there would be no benefit in that case.
12:04:31 <retardo> OK, I understand.  Thanks.
12:05:55 <retardo> I was hoping there would be a better way to write that skanky   Tick (\s -> let ... in let ... in ... ) expression.
12:06:31 <Darius> As for your question with regards to type synonyms: allowing type synonyms to be used in that case would give a bit of a type level abstraction which is an issue for type inference and checking.
12:07:07 <Darius> However, I believe Haskell also, unreasonably in my opinion, restricts usages of fully applied type synonyms too.  If you turn GHC extensions, it allows that case.
12:09:00 <Itkovian> hi all
12:09:02 <Darius> retardo: You can use valof to simplify your >>= definition, though the typical naming convention for functions of type m a -> a or along those lines is run<Monad>,i.e. runTick.
12:09:14 <xerox> hi there
12:09:29 <retardo> Thanks.
12:10:18 <Darius> retardo: You have superfluous parentheses in most of the places you use show.  Application binds tighter than anything, so you don't need to worry about infix operators.
12:11:21 <Darius> For the Expr data declaration, a Haskell programmer would almost -never- curry the constructors.
12:12:16 <Darius> Also in this case, the tuple leads to a level of indirection.  Putting ! (a strictness annotation) in front of it would get rid of that for a reasonable compiler, though of course Div _|_ would be _|_ then.
12:12:33 <Darius> uncurry/curry
12:13:43 <Darius> An efficiency thing for more realistic cases, is that you should define showsPrec and use shows, rather than show.
12:14:08 <xerox> @info shows
12:14:10 <lambdabot> -- shows is a variable
12:14:10 <lambdabot> shows :: forall a. (Show a) => a -> String -> String
12:14:38 <Darius> Some of your uses of 'let' can become uses of 'where', which is a little more common and I prefer it, but that's more up to you.
12:15:48 <Darius> Another efficiency thing, if you are interested, is that it would make sense to force s in tick to avoid making large thunks.
12:16:54 <Darius> You also have superfluous parens in your definition of (>>=) (the patterns), but many people have those in that case (probably because they don't realize they're superfluous)
12:18:11 <Darius> You shouldn't be getting a stack overflow for 'show (Con 3)'.
12:19:06 <retardo> I was getting a stack overflow back when all I had was "instance Show Expr" with no where clause.
12:19:17 <retardo> The current version does work.
12:19:28 <retardo> All of this advice is very helpful, thanks.
12:21:19 <retardo> The superfluous parentheses are mostly an MLism, because ML has the wrong precedence for practically everything.
12:21:52 <Darius> That's most of what I see.  There are some names that could be better, though this isn't Haskell-specific and Haskell programmers do often use short names.  One thing that is Haskelly, is different but related variables are often differentiated with ', i.e. a and a'.
12:23:45 <Darius> Other than that there's just some types you can abstract away from (e.g. data Expr a = Con a | Data (Expr a) (Expr a)), but I'll assume you fixed them for simplicity.
12:23:49 <retardo> I was going to do that, but then I wasn't sure that ' was legal in identifiers.  So I looked in the manual and it seemed to say not.
12:24:05 <Darius> It isn't to start, but other wise it's fine.
12:24:09 <Darius> @type \a' -> a'
12:24:10 <lambdabot> \a' -> a' :: forall t. t -> t
12:25:33 <retardo> Whups, there it is at the top of page 10.
12:28:47 <retardo> I can't omit the parentheses in   valof (Tick x) = ... , can I?
12:29:06 <retardo> SML would interpret that as defining valof to be a curried function.
12:31:38 <Darius> No, you can't.
12:32:05 <retardo> What did you mean by "force s in tick"?
12:32:15 <Darius> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
12:32:15 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
12:32:23 <Darius> Shows how I would write it.
12:32:23 <retardo> And why will it make a thunk?
12:32:42 <Darius> The "force tick" refers to the 'seq' in tick in the above.
12:32:59 <Darius> It would make a thunk because it won't know whether the tick value will ever be used.
12:33:51 <Darius> For example, if something ticked 3 times at the end you'd have (1+(1+(1+0))).
12:34:30 <Darius> It can't force those because it doesn't know whether you will actually use it, e.g. evalTick discards it.
12:34:50 <Darius> The names for evalTick and execTick come from similar functions in Control.Monad.State
12:34:59 <Darius> @type Control.Monad.State.evalState
12:34:59 <retardo> Oh, I see.  seq is just like \x -> \y -> y, but applying it to s forces the value of s to be calculated.
12:35:00 <lambdabot> Control.Monad.State.evalState :: forall a s.
12:35:00 <lambdabot> 				 Control.Monad.State.State s a -> s -> a
12:35:23 <Darius> retardo: Yes.  (\x -> \y -> y can be written \x y -> y)
12:36:15 <Darius> As written, the end result could be (1+10), but couldn't be (1+(1+9)).
12:36:19 <retardo> Is there a way to manufacture my own function that is strict in its first argument?
12:37:01 <retardo> Aha!  I finally understand what the $ operator is for.
12:37:17 <Darius> Have it force it's argument with seq or $! (assuming it doesn't force it itself anyways).  Unfortunately, Haskell doesn't have strictness annotations for functions like Clean.
12:38:43 <retardo> It appears that you can omit the definition of >> and it will infer the appropriate definition from the  definition of >>= .
12:39:20 <Darius> Yes. You can specify default definitions for methods in type classes.
12:39:41 <Darius> (>>)'s is m >> n = m >>= \_ -> n
12:39:52 <retardo> Yes, it says that in the manual.
12:40:07 <retardo> Reading over the definition of the standard prelude is very enlightening.
12:40:53 <retardo> Thanks again. 
12:41:34 <Darius> Ah, one final thing, is that it is often considered good style to give type definitions for top-level functions.
12:42:15 <retardo> Check.
12:42:35 <CosmicRay> and if you don't, haddock won't document them.
12:42:36 <CosmicRay> (gr)
12:42:45 <retardo> Do you know if there is a way to get HUGS to print out the types of the top-level definitions as it elaborates them?
12:44:05 <Darius> You can ask any implementation the type of something with :t in it's interactive prompt, but I don't believe there's a way to have it do it as it type checks.
12:44:28 <Darius> Also, I personally have a rather low opinion of Hugs and would thoroughly recommend GHC.
12:45:36 <retardo> What don't you like about Hugs?
12:47:45 <shapr> Kisses are better!
12:48:03 <Darius> It has horrible error messages (both type errors and run-time errors).  It doesn't allow definitions at run-time to even the little extent GHCi does, and it is(was?) less graceful with some errors.
12:48:38 <Darius> And of course, GHC is a compiler and produces much faster code.
12:48:48 <Philippa_> and supports more extensions, and...
12:49:08 <Philippa_> you can't chuck an expression using the arrow notation at Hugs atm, for example
12:49:54 <retardo> OK.
12:50:13 <Darius> The only things that recommend Hugs are 1) it may be easier to install for some architectures and 2) it starts up really fast.
12:50:59 <shapr> aj: hey, I didn't know you're a Jef Raskin fan.
12:51:18 <shapr> Right, hugs runs on the Sharp Zaurus, and GHC probably doesn't
12:51:29 <Darius> NHC should.
12:51:38 <shapr> true
12:51:52 <shapr> nhc could run on PalmOS too.
12:51:59 <shapr> But I wouldn't want to build GHC on PalmOS.
12:52:17 <shapr> 25MHz, 8MB of RAM... how long to build GHC?
12:52:21 <retardo> Implementing exceptions was somewhat easier.
12:52:42 <Darius> shapr: Infinite.  But you'd build on another machine and copy it to the Palm.
12:53:30 <Darius> Of course, it still probably wouldn't run.
12:54:30 <Darius> I just assume that if I (233Mhz/64MB) don't complain about GHC (... much), most people should have no issues.
13:03:41 <retardo> Is there a predefined name for a curried version of fst?
13:03:48 <retardo> That is, for \x y -> x?
13:03:49 <Riastradh> const
13:03:53 <Riastradh> @type const
13:03:54 <lambdabot> const :: forall a b. a -> b -> a
13:04:07 <retardo> What about for snd?
13:04:13 <Riastradh> flip const
13:04:15 <Riastradh> @type flip const
13:04:16 <lambdabot> flip const :: forall a b. b -> a -> a
13:04:21 <Riastradh> Or
13:04:23 <Riastradh> @type uncurry snd
13:04:24 <lambdabot> uncurry snd :: forall a b c. ((a, b -> c), b) -> c
13:04:30 <Riastradh> Er:
13:04:32 <Riastradh> @type curry snd
13:04:34 <lambdabot> curry snd :: forall a b. a -> b -> b
13:04:36 <retardo> Thanks.
13:12:21 * vegai contemplates a crazy type-searching contest.
13:13:30 <vegai> something along the lines of...
13:13:43 <vegai> @type curry const flip
13:13:45 <lambdabot> curry const flip :: forall b b1 a b2 c.

13:16:58 <vegai> shapr: yes, indeed
13:17:02 <goron> shapr: Any idea of how to print ppt slides with Linux. I am now using OpenOffice, but I can't get more than 4 slides on page.

13:17:39 <vegai> a special bonus if the contestant uses the expression for something useful, too :)

13:22:25 <musasabi> Lots of Pointless Parenthesises
13:22:33 <retardo> I got my three SML programs written in Haskell.  Thank you all once again.  I am happy with the day's work.
13:23:20 <Darius> musasabi:  That's not lots.  That's only 2^3...
13:24:41 <dblhelix> question about forcing evaluation: a common idiom seems to be:
13:24:59 <dblhelix> f x | x `seq` False = undefined
13:25:15 <dblhelix>     | otherwise = y
13:25:40 <dblhelix> I myself use: f x | x `seq` True =y
13:25:44 <Riastradh> ...how about just:   x `seq` y
13:26:20 <dblhelix> Riastradh: exactly my point, but the first alternative seems more common -- why?
13:26:30 <Riastradh> I have no idea.
13:27:18 <dblhelix> actually, I often use : f x | forced x = y with the obvious forced x = x `seq` True
13:27:55 <Itkovian> goron: export to pdf and then use kprinter or some pdf tool to put them on a page?
13:28:01 <dblhelix> well, 'often' ... I don't care about space efficiency that much too often ;)
13:28:28 <Itkovian> dang he's gone ...
13:29:09 <Philippa_> dblhelix: that one's sorta nice
13:29:29 <Philippa_> actually, thinking about that I *like* - it evaluates on the condition x has been evaluated already, which is makes damn sure is the case :-)
13:31:50 <dblhelix> Philippa_: indeed :)
13:32:30 <dblhelix> just wondered if I wasn't overlooking something here
13:32:46 <Darius> dblhelix: It's so all the forcing is in one place and out of the way of the rest of the algorithm.
13:33:03 <Darius> I.e. you write the function without worrying about strictness, and then just add that line at the top.
13:33:49 <Darius> Usually, there are patterns following f x | ..., and that case has only one guard (no otherwise clause).
13:33:50 <dblhelix> Darius: mmm, see your point, but I'm not sure if I find it convincing here
13:34:03 <Darius> In that particular example, it's fairly weak.
13:34:51 <dblhelix> Darius: well, when having multiple patterns over multiple constructors, you do have a point of course
13:39:22 <Philippa_> but then, you may as well do the foo/foo' pattern, where foo does the forcing then calls foo'
13:41:09 <dblhelix> yeah was thinking of that ... seems to have the same advantages ... unless the forcing has to be done on a param that already only shows up in a 'primed' definition (as in the current thread in haskell-cafe on the length function)
13:41:37 <Darius> Recursive calls.
13:41:59 <Darius> No that would work...
13:44:36 <Darius> I'd say the main benefit of the approach is that it is mostly orthogonal.  You don't have to change your code, just add to it.
13:47:25 <dblhelix> well, I wonder if I want it to be 'hidden' that way ... it might be a aspect too important to 'hide' that way ... still in doubt here ... anyway, I find the guard syntax not nice enough to think of it as not affecting the presentation of the code on the rhs ...
13:48:50 <dblhelix> sorry ... had a baby of ten months old over today ... I'm exhausted ... can't think that clearly now ... :S
13:48:57 <Philippa_> heh
13:49:05 <dblhelix> (not mine ;))
13:53:07 <dblhelix> so: time to call it a day now
13:53:13 <dblhelix> g'night
14:04:06 <Itkovian> anybody succesfully compiled hugs on MacOSX?
14:04:14 <Riastradh> Yes.
14:04:18 <Itkovian> ok.
14:04:26 <Itkovian> saves me the trouble of trying it :-)
14:04:31 <Riastradh> And with no difficulties that I remember.
14:05:03 <Itkovian> very good :-)
14:05:24 <Itkovian> it's just in case any of students ask for it ...
14:05:44 <Riastradh> GHC is usually a better option for most purposes, though.
14:06:21 <Itkovian> yeah i know ... but I've seen that most tend to stick with hugs when making their projects
14:06:32 <Itkovian> doesn't matter, really
14:07:06 <Itkovian> i extract them from the mail, push them through ghc and execute them with my examples :-)
14:07:17 <Itkovian> maybe I should have the computer give marks as well :-)
14:10:07 * boegel is back
14:12:40 <xerox> http://www.antimusic.com/news/04/dec/item07.shtml
14:13:33 <boegel> xerox: I heard about that on the radio... shitty stuff
14:13:43 <xerox> :-(
14:14:09 <Itkovian> oh man ...
14:14:19 <boegel> it was a small show, because there was no security check when entering ?
14:14:20 <Itkovian> how the hell did he get that gun inside?
14:14:33 <xerox> No checks?
14:14:38 <boegel> Itkovian: imagine a concert in The Frontline in Ghent
14:14:44 <Itkovian> hmm
14:14:46 <boegel> there are no checks there either
14:14:52 <Itkovian> prolly
14:14:57 <boegel> there aren't :
14:14:58 <boegel> :)
14:14:59 <Itkovian> but were' in Belgium :-)
14:15:11 <xerox> .bees ihih
14:15:17 <shapr> shootings never happen in Belgium?
14:15:18 <Itkovian> crap, my typing skills are rapidly deteriorating
14:15:23 <boegel> Itkovian: I dare you to try that in the AB in Brussels or some other big place
14:15:23 <xerox> hiya TheHunter :-)
14:15:24 <Itkovian> shapr: seldom
14:15:28 <boegel> no way you'll get a gun inside
14:15:29 <shapr> knifings?
14:15:36 <TheHunter> hi xerox 
14:15:51 <shapr> I think that nutty people will find a way to inflict damage.
14:15:52 <Itkovian> shapr: nope, not to my knowledge. They happen, but they're rare ... 
14:15:55 <Itkovian> true
14:16:13 <boegel> shapr: there have been a few incidents on some party's in the neigberhood
14:16:21 <pflanze> Hello. Very basic question: when do you need 'let' in haskell, when not? I'm seeing all examples w/o let, but ghci does seem to require it.
14:16:21 <Itkovian> shapr, what's the url of that nice short intro you made?
14:16:45 <shapr> pflanze: that's because ghci isn't really for "programming"
14:16:46 <Itkovian> pflanze: imho it's not required, you may as well use 'where'
14:16:58 <shapr> @wiki HaskellDemo
14:16:58 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
14:17:03 <shapr> that's the short intro I wrote.
14:17:11 <Philippa_> pflanze: that's just because GHCi tries to interpret what you write as an expression, the let tells it it's a definition
14:17:30 <Itkovian> thx
14:17:42 <Philippa_> (it's "in" all future things you type at it, to contrast with ordinary let expressions in Haskell)
14:18:16 <boegel> Itkovian: sometimes you _need_ to use let instead of where
14:19:05 <shapr> Is the "Pre-Madonna" programmer joke totally opaque?
14:19:30 <boegel> heya ngopher 
14:19:41 <psi> boegel: when?

14:19:52 * shapr cackles evilly
14:20:04 <psi> uhm :)
14:20:07 <shapr> bah, jag ska l√§se lite mer r√∂de orm.
14:20:14 <shapr> l√§sa
14:20:16 <Itkovian> exactly :-)
14:20:20 <boegel> psi: I needed it... I was something with extracing some variable from IO, and then using it further on...
14:20:30 <boegel> it only worked when using 'let' instead of 'where'
14:20:39 <Itkovian> boegel: hmmm
14:20:56 <boegel> Itkovian: I found it strange too
14:21:08 <TheHunter> psi: Foo { x = let bar = 4 in bar } works, Foo { x = bar where bar = 4 } doesn't
14:21:11 <boegel> but somebody here told me it was the only way to get it working
14:21:35 <Itkovian> TheHunter: Foo { x = 4 } ?
14:21:37 <Itkovian> :-)
14:21:54 <TheHunter> well, i think that's a design mistake.
14:22:17 <TheHunter> i really hate `let' (probably because haskell is my first functional language)
14:22:35 <musasabi> you can do "var <- ioaction" in ghci
14:22:38 <Itkovian> I think 'where' makes for better readability ...
14:22:47 <Philippa_> musasabi: true, damn useful that
14:22:55 <Itkovian> I dislike the list of let stuff in e.g. ML, and I always have trouble reading it
14:23:14 <boegel> "Witnesses also say that they were not searched nor was there any metal detectors."
14:23:21 <psi> TheHunter: hm, ok
14:23:23 <TheHunter> yep, it's really surprising how difficult it is to read ml.
14:23:26 <shapr> boegel: Still, that's normal.
14:23:29 * Philippa_ has the Tyop interpreter set up so you can chuck type declarations at it no problem, let <declaration> also works and anything else better be an expression or a command
14:23:37 <boegel> shapr: very true
14:23:45 <boegel> they only search you on big events
14:23:47 <Itkovian> TheHunter: I'd like to learn it though, cos it seems to be good and fast ...
14:23:51 <shapr> Sane people don't carry guns into nightclubs.
14:24:00 <Itkovian> idd
14:24:23 <shapr> Sane people who do carry guns into nightclubs are usually a) cops or b) living in some backwoods part of Texas where you need a gun for the animals, not the people.
14:24:30 <pflanze> Hm, I still don't get it. Is there a paste robot here where I can show what I'm trying to achieve?
14:24:42 <shapr> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
14:24:42 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
14:24:44 <Itkovian> I thought sheep were peaceful animals?
14:25:02 <boegel> Itkovian: not when they're horny :p
14:25:07 <shapr> wolves, bears, very large cats, they are not peaceful.
14:25:21 <Itkovian> shapr: ah but you can feed them sheep ...
14:25:32 <Philippa_> bullets're cheaper
14:26:00 <shapr> jaguarundis are peaceful at least.
14:26:04 <boegel> it happened in America, and half of the people there are gun-nuts
14:26:16 <shapr> are not :-P
14:26:42 <shapr> Half the people in the Netherlands are pot addicts?
14:27:04 <Itkovian> yes.
14:27:05 <Itkovian> :-)
14:27:11 <Philippa_> Damn them all, they're stealing our supply!
14:27:12 <Philippa_> er
14:27:14 <Philippa_> *cough*
14:27:17 <Philippa_> I mean...
14:27:31 <shapr> Actually, gun nuts are much more safe with guns than clueless people.
14:27:42 <pflanze> shapr: ok, if I understood right, I just enter my code into that wiki page - it's there now.
14:27:43 <Itkovian> perhaps.
14:27:44 <Philippa_> except you get clueless gun nuts
14:27:55 <shapr> Philippa_: they don't live long.
14:27:57 <boegel> shapr: half the people in Belgium are pot addicts.... let alone in the Netherlands :p
14:28:19 <Philippa_> you see bowling for columbine, the guy who for defence in the house was using an AR-15 w/armour piercing (= goes straight through the wall and hits somebody in the room next door) ammo?
14:28:43 <Philippa_> shapr: some cluelessness is more subtle
14:28:49 <shapr> that's not a gun nut :-)
14:28:55 * boegel should really see bowling for columbine once...
14:29:03 <shapr> real gun nuts use glazer ammo for home defense
14:29:06 <boegel> shapr: what is he then ? sane ? :p
14:29:10 <Riastradh> _Bowling for Columbine_ is a really good movie.
14:29:13 <Philippa_> he was in a bloody militia, that good enough to count?
14:29:22 <boegel> Riastradh: documentary :p
14:29:32 <shapr> Bowling for Columbine is also pop media and very inaccurate.
14:29:38 <Philippa_> yeah, I know
14:29:41 <musasabi> I didn't like BfC very much
14:29:48 <Riastradh> shapr, very inaccurate about what areas?
14:30:11 <musasabi> It was too direct for a satire and not very good as propaganda.
14:30:14 <shapr> Riastradh: there are several websites that have detailed lists of the inaccuracies, use the google
14:31:01 <TheHunter> pflanze, you need parens around (y+1), but still, it's a very unusual way of taking five elements.
14:31:49 <pflanze> TheHunter: yeah, I'm pretty sure it's unusual :) 
14:32:05 <shapr> Anyway, more people die from car accidents and drunk driving, why not ban those first? :-P
14:32:12 <wagle> where is pflanze's code?
14:32:42 <wagle> shapr: more people want to drive and get drunk
14:32:47 <Philippa> shapr: they /are/ banned :-) (OK, complete genuine "what-the-fuck-could-I've-done" accidents aren't)
14:33:03 <shapr> cars aren't banned.
14:33:06 <Itkovian> pflanze: are you sure the second line is ok/ it seems kinda weird to me
14:33:23 <Philippa> cars have non-lethal, non-leisure uses
14:33:25 <wagle> where is pflanze's code?  </whine>
14:33:41 <shapr> I think guns have non-lethal leisure uses.
14:33:46 <TheHunter> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
14:33:47 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
14:33:53 <shapr> hoi vincenz 
14:34:04 <musasabi> shapr: but you need a permit to use a car.
14:34:09 <Philippa> yeah, that's not as big an argument for allowing them
14:34:20 <Philippa> musasabi: in some places you need one to use a gun, or else to own or to buy
14:34:28 <wagle> ... less than obvious when one is jumping into the middle..  8/
14:34:31 <shapr> Most places in the USA.
14:34:42 <shapr> waiting period, criminal check, blah blah
14:34:50 <musasabi> Philippa: yes, I know and that makes sense.. (that is if those are not just automatons)
14:35:09 <shapr> Finland has less strict laws about gun use than the USA.
14:35:22 <musasabi> getting drivers license is nonautomatic and quite hard.
14:35:35 <shapr> Germany and Belgium have scary laws about gun use by civilians.
14:35:36 <Philippa> yeah. I /do/ buy the culture argument in BfC, even if half the examples're crap
14:35:37 <musasabi> shapr: yes, mainly because guns are not a problem here.
14:36:31 <shapr> I reserver the right to arm bears!
14:36:41 <wagle> i dunno why, but i remember mostly nothing about BfC
14:37:13 * musasabi knows many people owning guns but those are mostly stuff from WWII and noone I know carries a gun with him.
14:37:19 <TheHunter> pflanze, and i guess you mean take5 x 5 = []
14:37:22 <shapr> I think the gun control issue in the USA is smokescreen to get votes.
14:37:58 <vegai> huh, Japan's not very pacifist anymore :/
14:38:01 <musasabi> shapr: a culture which encourages people to carry/use guns is very bad.
14:38:08 <Lunar^> shapr: Do you know planner.el, btw ?
14:38:16 <shapr> I don't think the USA encourages everyday gun carry/use.
14:38:23 <shapr> Lunar^: oui, c'est sachac
14:38:27 <shapr> elle est tres jolie =)
14:38:36 <shapr> connais tu Sacha Chua?
14:38:49 <wagle> i dont think i ever see people (obviously anyway) carrying guns around
14:38:50 <Lunar^> shapr: I'm following Debian-Women
14:39:02 <musasabi> shapr: so why do you think that shootings with e.g. burglars are more common there?
14:39:07 <shapr> I got an SMS from Sacha a few months back :-)
14:39:16 <Philippa> musasabi: which way round?
14:39:17 <Lunar^> shapr: She joined not long ago, so I've discovered her website and was deeply impressed
14:39:30 <shapr> Yes, Sacha is cool.
14:39:34 <Philippa> I suspect it's because in the US, a burglar who gets caught can be shot in the first place. It becomes self-defence, regardless of legality
14:40:02 <wagle> no, you will have trouble proving self-defense
14:40:03 <shapr> in New York state, if you shoot a burgular who was not threatening your life, you get manslaughter
14:40:06 <shapr> most states are like that.
14:40:13 <Philippa> wagle: I'm not using it in the legal sense
14:40:21 <Philippa> I'm using it in the "I did it to defend myself" sense
14:40:44 <Philippa> it's done to remove an immediate threat that you're not going to find out anything more about before running a significant risk of being shot
14:40:45 <musasabi> afaik most gun crimes here are usually drunk gun owners threatening to kill themselves / their loved ones
14:40:51 <Philippa> figures
14:40:51 <shapr> scary
14:41:24 <shapr> Lunar^: sacha hung out here on #haskell for a few weeks recently.
14:41:28 <Philippa> shapr: that's good to hear, I hear too much from people who live in states where you'd get away with it entirely
14:41:31 <boegel> for some reason more and more people want to kill themselves
14:41:39 <boegel> I find that a scary thought
14:41:46 <shapr> Why?
14:41:53 <Lunar^> shapr: uh.. didn't notice
14:42:13 <shapr> Lunar^: maybe we can persuade her to visit europe and hang out with us.
14:42:20 <Philippa> boegel: has somebody collected the stats? I suspect a lot of it's reporting error mind
14:42:28 <boegel> shapr: by killing yourself you think you solve your problems, but you hurt so many people with it
14:42:30 <wagle> my impression is that most people think you automatically can claim self-defense, then get very surprised when they are run through a wringer having to prove it..
14:42:43 <musasabi> but sleep.. good night.
14:42:55 <Lunar^> shapr: mh.. trip from Japan is going to be costly, but I told you about Libre Software Meeting for july, didn't I ?
14:42:57 <shapr> I think that gun control is less an issue than gasoline use.
14:43:02 <Philippa> wagle: what's the standard of proof required where you are?
14:43:05 <shapr> Lunar^: she moved to Japan already?
14:43:19 <Lunar^> shapr: /whois sachac
14:43:24 <wagle> Philippa: i dunno..  i dont have a gun..
14:43:25 <Philippa> shapr: fair enough, sort it out. I gather US driving tests're a little easy
14:43:33 <Philippa> wagle: you don't need a gun to act in self-defence
14:43:52 <shapr> I own several guns, and I am relatively proficient in their use.
14:43:56 <Philippa> I'm quite capable of crippling somebody without a weapon, you just need how to attack the right joints
14:44:00 <Philippa> *need to know
14:44:22 <shapr> I've never shot anybody. I've never *wanted* to shoot anybody.
14:44:47 * boegel hopes it stays that way
14:44:56 * TheHunter thinks he remebers having heard that in switzerland (where people keep their guns after military service) there are 5 times as many people killed by gunfire as in germany.
14:45:01 <shapr> I have had a very large number of fellow US Citizens tell me that guns should be completely outlawed.
14:45:21 <shapr> I heard that switzerland has nearly zero shootings.
14:45:39 <Philippa> TheHunter: how much of that's suicide where the gun's just the most convenient available means?
14:45:42 <shapr> I think crazy people just do crazy stuff.
14:45:50 <wagle> people tend to leave me alone, so its njever been an issue
14:46:10 <shapr> The head of the foreign ministry of Sweden was stabbed to death while she was shopping. Should we outlaw knives?
14:46:16 <TheHunter> Philippa, i have no idea, i'm not very sure of the actual number either.
14:46:21 <Philippa> wagle: fair enough. I suspect the legal tests'll have something to do with whether the level of force you used was justified, which is why shooting somebody in self-defence puts you in trouble
14:46:32 <Philippa> shapr: they're controlled here
14:46:38 <shapr> They're controlled in the US too.
14:46:40 <Lunar^> shapr: Maybe she would be dead if guns were freely available
14:46:45 <shapr> She is dead.
14:46:57 * Lunar^ hides
14:47:01 <TheHunter> shapr, by allowing people to have guns you make it too easy for them to use them.
14:47:03 <Philippa> granted, not to the extent that there's no way to legally carry a potentially-lethal blade...
14:47:30 <shapr> Cars are more dangerous than guns on a sheer kinetic energy basis.
14:48:03 <wagle> my understanding is that if you pull a gun on someone, you HAVE to be willing to shoot them with it..
14:48:07 <TheHunter> in fact, i guess US officials know guns are bad. In fact in Iraq, people aren't allowed to own guns.
14:48:25 <Philippa> wagle: pretty much, because that's what you're telling them
14:48:48 <Maddas> TheHunter: I find that hard to believe. I think Germany has a higher per capita rate of murders with firearms.
14:49:03 <shapr> I doubt we're changing minds here :-)
14:49:05 <wagle> [else they take it from you and shoot YOU with it]
14:49:06 <Philippa> what, than Iraq? At present?
14:49:08 * shapr goes to eat more pizza.
14:49:11 <Philippa> (OK, /conviction/, sure)
14:49:31 <Maddas> shapr: Enjoy
14:49:56 <Maddas> Are there any good (reasonably trustworthy) online sources for such kind of statistics?
14:52:10 <Maddas> TheHunter: According to nationmaster.com (citing "Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems" as reference), Germany has over 9x more murders with firearms per capita than Switzerland
14:52:12 <TheHunter> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_and_crime
14:52:33 <stepcut> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1566715.stm
14:52:43 <SamB> Maddas: maybe the swiss people use something else!
14:53:46 <TheHunter> ok, sorry i must have remembered it wrong.
14:53:49 <wagle> i think the swiss view guns as "us vs the world" and usa'ian as "me vs the world"
14:54:04 <wagle> i dunno what the germans might think
14:54:11 <SamB> toys?
14:54:12 <TheHunter> but keep in mind that rifles are something different than pistols.
14:54:15 <Maddas> Hm, I thought you get 50 rounds of ammunition, not 24
14:54:43 <stepcut> this page claims switzerland has a homocide rate of 1.2 /100,000
14:54:45 <stepcut> http://www.ncpa.org/pi/crime/pd061099b.html
14:55:10 <Maddas> TheHunter: I might be wrong as well, but I do find five times more than Germany hard to believe (I assume you meant it in total, not per capita)
14:56:10 <TheHunter> Maddas, no i meant it per capita of course.
14:56:23 <wagle> if i lived in switzerland, i'd own a gun..  but i dont here
14:56:38 <Maddas> TheHunter: Hm
14:57:08 <wagle> here, you have to want one.. in switzerland wanting one has little [?] to do with it
14:57:59 <wagle> so here, the people with guns are "unusual" in some sense that i'm trying to put my finger on
14:58:17 <Maddas> It's completely normal to see people walking around with rifles here
14:58:29 <Maddas> (Here being Switzerland)
14:58:32 <wagle> Maddas: where are you?
14:58:46 <wagle> ash
14:58:47 <wagle> ah
14:58:49 <Maddas> :-)
15:00:26 <CosmicRay> Maddas: it is completely normal to see people driving around with rifles and confederate flags mounted on their pickups a few hours south of here :-)
15:00:26 <Maddas> (Those people practically always being dressed in military outfit, that is)
15:00:30 <CosmicRay> (I speak of Oklahoma <g>)
15:00:41 <Maddas> haha
15:01:30 <CosmicRay> (Those people practically always being dressed in beer-stained jeans, ripped t-shirt, smelling of cigarettes and/or beer)
15:01:44 * Philippa always wanted an RPG for road travel, but somehow suspects this isn't practical
15:01:48 <Maddas> Doesn't sound too comforting :-)
15:01:56 <vincenz> hi shapr !
15:01:59 <TheHunter> <Maddas>  Germany has over 9x more murders with firearms per capita than Switzerland
15:02:05 <wagle> Philippa: GTA
15:02:05 <Maddas> Philippa: heh.
15:02:06 <TheHunter> That's obviously nonsense.
15:02:08 <CosmicRay> Maddas: I prefer not to stop in rural Oklahoma if I can avoid it :-)
15:02:08 <vincenz> :)
15:02:16 <Maddas> TheHunter: That was according to one number I found.
15:02:29 <Philippa> wagle: in GTA I don't have to sit on the M25 for 3 hours...
15:02:46 <Maddas> I don't know which numbers to trust and which not, sorry :-)
15:02:48 <wagle> M25?
15:02:55 <Philippa> the UK's largest carpark
15:02:58 <Philippa> pretends to be a motorway
15:03:01 <wagle> hahaha
15:03:20 <Maddas> Heh
15:03:29 <wagle> 3 hours = about 5 km?
15:03:36 <Philippa> that kinda thing, yeah
15:03:44 <Philippa> the phrase "quicker walking" is often used
15:03:51 <CosmicRay> heh
15:03:58 <wagle> yeah.. seattles sorta like that..  portlands getting there
15:05:03 <wagle> you very bicycle friendly?
15:05:48 <Philippa> me, I just walk and use the busses and trains most of the time
15:06:09 <Philippa> I would bike, but I was rather good at falling off as a kid
15:06:24 <wagle> portlands got a fair amount of bike paths and the busses can carry bikes
15:06:51 <Philippa> there's a decent number of bike paths around here, and you might get away with stowing a bike the section for assorted big luggage
15:06:56 <wagle> i could bike faster than the buses, even on 20 mile trips
15:07:02 <Philippa> believable
15:07:23 <wagle> portland buses all have bike racks on front
15:07:24 <TheHunter> Maddas, that were absolute numbers. the relative number, according to that nationmaster statistic is 85% (less murders in germany).
15:07:36 <Maddas> TheHunter: Erk. I don't know where Nationmaster got the number from, but checking the reference myself gives very different numbers
15:07:48 <Maddas> Oops :-)
15:07:52 <TheHunter> not as impressive as 5 times as much, but still significant.
15:08:35 <Maddas> 0.47 for Germany intentional homicides commited with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants for Germany, 0.56 for Switzerland
15:09:08 <TheHunter> even more if you take into account that swiss probably are more peaceful than germans.
15:09:08 <Maddas> Assuming I managed to read the numbers correctly this time :-)
15:09:30 * Maddas shrugs
15:10:54 <TheHunter> (for example the wealthy germans that are just hiding their money in switzerland are likely to be more peaceful </flame>)
15:10:59 <Maddas> I wonder whether there are more detailed numbers, I wonder how those break down according to areas and/or population groups
15:11:50 <wagle> argggh..  i'm doomed!  (just recieved email mass mailed to a bunch of addresses, the first of which hasnt existed in 8 years)
15:13:16 <wagle> i wonder how or even if you can get trully correct figures
15:13:35 <hjq98> hi i read somewhere that said that most haskell functions can be redfined using map, foldr. how true is this?
15:13:48 <TheHunter> wagle, you can't.
15:14:42 <TheHunter> hjq98, pretty true for many functions working on lists.
15:14:42 <wagle> TheHunter: yeah..  i was being wistful
15:14:55 <hjq98> TheHunter, only on lists?
15:15:04 <TheHunter> @type foldr
15:15:04 <Philippa> 'cos that's all they operate on
15:15:05 <lambdabot> foldr :: forall b a. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
15:15:24 <Philippa> generalisations thereof can do pretty well on trees and the like, mind
15:15:27 <TheHunter> foldr (:) === (++)
15:15:30 <hjq98> Phillippa, yes come to think of it you have a point....
15:15:32 <wagle> there is a generalized fold
15:15:36 <TheHunter> foldr (+) 0 = sum
15:15:49 <Philippa> wagle: a generalised map, too
15:16:14 <Philippa> unfortunately it's a typeclass thing, so you gotta define it...
15:16:35 <wagle> was trying to think of what its haskell name was
15:16:37 <hjq98> yes i am not very good at it though
15:16:45 <Maddas> TheHunter: Hm, the number makes sense, there were 13 murders in Switzerland in 2002.
15:16:46 <Philippa> wagle: fmap
15:16:54 <wagle> nono the fold
15:17:00 <Philippa> ah. No idea, off-hand
15:17:13 <wagle> catamorphism = ___ . fmap
15:18:36 <hjq98> i've only just started to re write lists functions in map foldr foldl etc. i get confused pretty easily, any advise on a sound approach anyone?
15:19:34 <TheHunter> wagle, i thought catamorphism =~= fold
15:19:58 <Philippa> if you're turning a list into another list by doing things to it pointwise, you're looking at a map
15:21:05 <TheHunter> hjq98, maybe it helps to write the functions with explicit recursion first, and than try to figure out how to do it with foldr.
15:21:22 <wagle> catathe the patterns and skeletons stuff i've been trying to get around to reading up on let the catamorphism transform the elements before the fold
15:21:28 <hjq98> what do you mean by 'explicit recursion'?
15:21:38 <wagle> s/^cata//
15:21:53 <TheHunter> sum' [] = 0
15:22:01 <TheHunter> sum' (x:xs) = x + sum xs
15:22:10 <TheHunter> err, sum' xs
15:22:14 <hjq98> yes that's recursion coz you use sum again
15:22:30 <Philippa> hjq98: writing it out yourself rather than letting a HOF do the recursive bit for you
15:22:30 <TheHunter> now a fold does both things in one step
15:23:15 <Philippa> eg map is defined recursively, but calling it isn't explicitly recursive
15:23:27 <TheHunter> sum'' = foldr (\x oldSum -> + x + oldSum) 0
15:23:33 <wagle> fold . map (+1)
15:24:06 <hjq98> can u define sum using map and foldr/foldl?
15:24:30 <TheHunter> hjq98, it's important to see how the recursive and the foldr definition are the same thing.
15:26:23 <TheHunter> sum === foldr (+) 0 === foldl (+) 0.
15:26:39 <hjq98> yes i agree
15:26:55 <TheHunter> you can think of foldr as replacing the (:) in the list construction with another function:
15:27:33 <hjq98> (f1 (f2 ... (..))?
15:27:52 <TheHunter> foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] === foldr (+) 0 (1:(2:(3:[]))) === (1+(2+(3+0)))
15:28:38 <hjq98> ok but .. i can't figure out still if i can redefine sum'' using map AND foldr
15:28:51 <hjq98> sum'' was defined with foldr
15:29:20 <TheHunter> why would you need map?
15:30:12 <hjq98> oh i was just asking because of my earlier question.. that someone somewhere said you can redefine lists functions with map, foldr/foldl?
15:30:15 <hjq98> so it's not really true?
15:30:28 <hjq98> in some cases u can, but others u can't
15:30:49 <TheHunter> that means map and/or foldr.
15:31:31 <hjq98> right, that's why i was a little lost.. because i couldn
15:31:43 <TheHunter> in fact, map f = foldr (\x xs -> f x : xs) []
15:31:43 <hjq98> couldn't find a map and fold def for sum
15:32:29 <TheHunter> map doesn't give you anything if you want sum.
15:34:49 <hjq98> yes...
15:37:10 <wagle> ah..  "reduce" is the term for fold that I was looking for
15:38:09 <hjq98> ok help me out with this one then...
15:38:59 <hjq98> if i hv foldr (+) 2 (map (*1) [3])
15:39:09 <wagle> according to rabhi and gorlatch, h is a _list_ catamorphism wrt a binary op * if h (l1 ++ l2) = (h l1) * (h l2)
15:39:26 <TheHunter> @type foldr (+) 2 (map (*1) [3])
15:39:27 <lambdabot> foldr (+) 2 (map (*1) [3]) :: forall a. (Num a) => a
15:40:16 <TheHunter> map (*1) [3] multiplies each element of the list [3] by 1
15:40:20 <hjq98> can we write another function to mean the same thing, without using map and fold?
15:40:27 <boegel> I'm going to bed... happy haskelling everybody !
15:40:35 <TheHunter> night boegel 
15:40:43 <hjq98> night boegel
15:40:44 <wagle> but then continue to observe that h can be decomposed such that h = map phi . reduce *
15:40:59 <TheHunter> the map doesn't do anything, obviously 
15:41:11 <TheHunter> so that'd be foldr (+) 2 [3]
15:41:14 <TheHunter> or sum [3]
15:41:16 <TheHunter> or 3
15:41:18 <hjq98> i thought the map multiplies 1 to 3?
15:41:18 <wagle> not true at all for their examples
15:41:47 <hjq98> let's say i hv foldr (+) 2 (map (*3) [3])
15:42:13 <hjq98> then map (*3) [3] is [9]
15:42:32 <jadrian> hjq98: maybe this is what you want?  foldr (.) id (map (+) [1,2,3]) 0
15:43:07 <jadrian> also works with foldl
15:43:14 <jadrian> not sure which fold you are looking for
15:43:26 <jadrian> that is a sum as a fold of a map
15:43:28 <hjq98> erm, i was trying to work more on lists... basically i want to find out... now that i have a map and a fold
15:43:44 <jadrian> that is on lists
15:43:45 <TheHunter> wagle, the reduce in that example is just the weird ml name of fold(r/l?), isn't it.
15:43:47 <hjq98> can i redefine it to mean the same thing without using map and fold?
15:44:00 <jadrian> sum xs = foldr (.) id (map (+) xs) 0
15:44:25 <wagle> their reduce is parallel
15:44:27 <jadrian> but then again I have no idea why you'd want to use map and fold
15:44:50 <TheHunter> hjq98, you need fold or explicit recursion to define a sum.
15:44:53 <hjq98> i was just trying to work more on lists
15:45:03 <hjq98> to manipulate and understand better
15:45:27 <wagle> they claim (in intro) that this decomposition into map ; reduce exposes parallelism
15:45:45 <wagle> i have finished reading, so i'm really fuzzy
15:45:59 <wagle> i havent finished reading, so i'm really fuzzy
15:50:36 <hjq98> jadrian : what does the (.) mean?
15:50:41 <hjq98> and id?
15:51:08 <hjq98> ok.. i juz got it .. id is id x = x
15:52:19 <TheHunter> hjq98, you're trying to understand jadrian's definition?
15:52:49 <jdrake> moo
15:53:01 <TheHunter> @moo
15:53:01 <lambdabot>          (__)
15:53:01 <lambdabot>          (oo)
15:53:01 <lambdabot>    /------\/
15:53:01 <lambdabot>   / |    ||
15:53:01 <lambdabot>  *  /\---/\
15:53:02 <lambdabot>     ~~   ~~
15:53:04 <lambdabot> ...."Have you mooed today?"...
15:53:07 <jdrake> oh shit
15:53:19 <hjq98> i didn't understand what the (.) was doing
15:53:40 <TheHunter> do you see what map (+) xs does?
15:54:09 <TheHunter> @type (+)
15:54:10 <lambdabot> (+) :: forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
15:54:35 <hjq98> yes i know about (+) but (.)?
15:54:54 <kristnjov> . is an operator
15:54:56 <hjq98> i am trying out on ghci at the same time...
15:54:59 <kristnjov> function composition
15:55:01 <TheHunter> (.) is function composition.
15:55:17 <TheHunter> so what's the result of map (+) [1,2,3] ?
15:55:22 <kristnjov> i know i know!
15:55:33 <hjq98> 1+2+3
15:55:33 <jdrake> Mon livre, l'ecole de Haskell de l'expression, est arrive!
15:55:45 <TheHunter> hjq98, no.
15:55:49 <kristnjov> :\
15:55:51 <kristnjov> nice try though
15:56:04 <TheHunter> what's (+) 1
15:56:06 <hjq98> ok let me try on ghci :D
15:57:01 <hjq98> (+) is numeric operation.. takes 2 int and returns an int
15:57:21 <kristnjov> @type (+)
15:57:23 <lambdabot> (+) :: forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
15:57:33 <hjq98> yes
15:57:41 <hjq98> that's what i was trying to say
15:57:41 <TheHunter> well, (+) take an Int and returns a function that maps Ints to Ints.
15:57:53 <TheHunter> this is known as currying
15:57:55 <vincenz> shapr: you know c++
15:57:56 <vincenz> ?
15:58:25 <TheHunter> so (+) 3 is the function mapping x to x+3
15:58:42 <hjq98> i see
15:58:54 <wagle> is it x |-> 3 + x?
15:59:32 <TheHunter> sorry, wagle is right, it maps x to 3+x.
15:59:38 <hjq98> [x | x <- x +3]
15:59:46 <hjq98> oops
16:00:32 <wagle> (+) == (\x y -> x + y) == (\x -> (\y -> x + y))
16:00:53 <wagle> (+ 3) == (\x -> x + 3)
16:01:09 <wagle> (3 +) == (\y -> 3 + y)
16:01:10 <hjq98> [x + 3 | x <- [0,1,2]]
16:01:29 <wagle> note that the names (eg, x and y) are made up
16:01:56 <hjq98> hmm
16:02:04 <wagle> (+) 3 == (\x -> (\y -> x + y)) 3
16:02:20 <wagle> (+) 3 == (\x -> (\y -> x + y)) 3 == (\y -> 3 + y)
16:02:34 <wagle> </tangent>
16:03:01 <wagle> i just wondered how clearly i could state that
16:05:08 <jadrian> back! import/export question
16:05:21 <jadrian> I got a module A that imports B
16:05:29 <jadrian> I got no explicit exports in A
16:05:35 <jadrian> so it just exports everything
16:05:45 <jadrian> but I want A to export B too!
16:06:08 <jadrian> to do that I need to explicitly export module B
16:06:36 <wagle> ick
16:06:47 <jadrian> but won't I need to explicitly export everything from A then?
16:06:49 <jadrian> :-/
16:07:26 <jadrian> so my question is, which is the easiest way for A to export all its definitions, and also the imported module B
16:07:44 <jadrian> MegaMonad: any idea?
16:07:50 <MegaMonad> jadrian: The idea if so.
16:08:11 <TheHunter> good night, #haskell.
16:08:17 <TheHunter> MegaMonad, good night.
16:08:23 <MegaMonad> TheHunter: Ikegami: would you like unicycling, and go is a little program called "night-time-script" or something like wxwidgets or gtk.
16:08:35 <wagle> i said "ick" on the principle that you were removing all the module boundaries
16:08:50 <wagle> but i dont really know the solution in general
16:09:04 <jadrian> why not... I want to export *everything*
16:09:14 <wagle> but i'm sure there is a stock solution 
16:09:33 <jadrian> I can't find it...
16:09:52 <wagle> i havent used modules in haskell
16:10:05 <hjq98> > applyAll :: [a -> b] -> a -> b
16:10:05 <hjq98> > applyAll f x = foldr (map applyit f) x where applyit (fun) = fun x
16:10:08 <jadrian> I wish there was a shortcut for export everything, besides not using exports
16:10:09 <jadrian> something like
16:10:12 <wagle> so i'm not the one to ask (and i shoulda stayed quiet)
16:10:17 <hjq98> sorry ... 
16:10:29 <hjq98> was trying to ask wat's wrong with it? i couldn't get it to compile
16:10:30 <Igloo> module Foo (module Foo) where ...
16:10:39 <jadrian> Igloo: ah
16:11:00 <jadrian> Igloo: it seems obvious now that you said it
16:13:11 <jadrian> just one more question
16:13:20 <jadrian> I got a multiparameter class
16:13:29 <jadrian> class Foo a b | a->b where
16:13:55 <jadrian> can I get a class synonim for Foo a a?
16:13:57 <jadrian> I did
16:14:09 <jadrian> class Foo a a => Bar a where
16:14:16 <jadrian> and this kind of works
16:14:22 <jadrian> but I can't use it for
16:14:29 <jadrian> instanc Bar a where
16:14:34 <wagle> existential type?
16:14:38 <jadrian>  methodOfFoo = ...
16:15:07 <jadrian> wagle: I don't know much about them, could you elaborte?
16:15:19 <wagle> what does it say when you try this?
16:15:58 <jadrian> Variable not in scope "method"
16:16:27 <wagle> can i see the code?
16:16:41 <jadrian> yeah it's ok
16:16:43 <wagle> (i like multiparameter fu)
16:16:45 <jadrian> but it's pretty big
16:17:20 <wagle> well, you might find the problem by reducing it to the smallest piece of code that has the problem
16:17:26 <jadrian> class SubData a b | a->b where
16:17:26 <jadrian>     subData    :: a->[b]
16:17:26 <jadrian>     updSubData :: a->[b]-> a
16:17:29 <jadrian> etc
16:17:34 <jadrian> and then
16:17:47 <jadrian> class SubData a a => RecData a where
16:18:15 <jadrian> now when I try:
16:18:20 <wagle> whats the "| a -> b" stuff again (i've seen people talk about it, but havent used it)
16:18:38 <jadrian> functional dependency
16:18:59 <wagle> whats your intent?
16:19:11 <jadrian> it's kind of complicatde to explain it all
16:19:21 <jadrian> it's my own small generic programming module
16:19:24 <jadrian> :)
16:19:26 <wagle> ok.. lemme chase it down,..  continue
16:19:53 <jadrian> so now, instead  of declaring stuff of class  SubData
16:19:59 <jadrian> which takes 2 parameters
16:20:15 <jadrian> I'd like to be able to use RecData as a synonim...
16:20:20 <hjq98> thanks to all for helping with my queries. gtg zzz
16:20:30 <jadrian> but I know that's not what this means: class SubData a a => RecData a where
16:20:40 <jadrian> not sure if what I want is possible
16:20:41 <jadrian> brb
16:21:40 <wagle> try class SubData a a => RecData a | a -> a where
16:21:42 <wagle> ?
16:22:17 <wagle> (might not make sense)
16:22:38 <jadrian> doesn't really makes much sense...
16:22:48 <wagle> i'm still googling for a coherent description of functional dependency
16:23:01 <jadrian> problem is that I can indeed use RecData in contexts where I should have SubData a a
16:23:06 <jadrian> but!
16:23:18 <jadrian> what I cannot do is declare something as an instance of RecData a
16:23:24 <jadrian> instead of SubData a a
16:23:30 <jadrian> doesn't matter much
16:23:37 <jadrian> but it would be more readable
16:23:48 <jadrian> I think
16:23:57 <jadrian> and then again maybe not
16:29:24 <wagle> geez!  where IS the defn of functional dependencies?
16:30:12 <Igloo> Should be in the GHC user's guide
16:31:10 <Philippa> only it's badly documented
16:31:15 <Philippa> for further info read the paper I guess
16:31:19 <wagle> har har
16:31:43 <wagle> i understood it when i saw people talk about it, just cant remember
16:32:47 * wagle yells
16:32:53 <wagle> There should be more documentation, but there isn't (yet). Yell if you need it.
16:34:36 <Philippa> a fundep says that if you know all the variables on the LHS, you also know the variables on the RHS
16:34:50 <wagle> Philippa: you use the word "badly" to mean "not at all"?
16:34:51 <Philippa> (because there'll only be one instance per possible LHS)
16:35:04 <Philippa> I don't know, they bothered to say the feature's there...
16:35:15 <wagle> hehj
16:35:25 <Philippa> they even gave a brief example to show what their concrete syntax for it is
16:37:07 <wagle> oh yeah  -> is really /\/>
16:37:18 <wagle> "uniquely determines"
16:42:09 * jadrian just typed all his thoughts into an email, and sent it to the haskell mailing list
16:42:29 <wagle> good plan
16:42:34 <jadrian> it was easier to explain in a text with examples in between
16:42:42 <jadrian> that line by line in here...
16:42:54 <jadrian> I don't think what I want it's possible though
16:43:11 <jadrian> it's also not much of a problem, still it would be nice
16:49:05 <jadrian> Question 2:
16:49:49 <jadrian> Is there any way to substitue  (Foo a b, Foo b a)   by (DoubleFoo a b)
16:50:26 <jadrian> again this *almost works*
16:50:45 <jadrian> class (Foo a b, Foo b a) => DoubleFoo a b where
16:51:05 <jadrian> now I can use DoubelFoo a b instead of (Foo a b, Foo b a)
16:51:11 <jadrian> when I use methods of Foo 
16:51:13 <jadrian> but!!
16:51:43 <jadrian> if I use (DoubleFoo a b) ins dome function dfoo
16:52:01 <jadrian> and I now need to use dfoo in some function dfoo2
16:52:06 <jadrian> I have the same problem again
16:52:27 <jadrian> I have to declare DoubleFoo a b and DoubleFoo b a in the context
16:54:41 <wagle> you using ghc or hugs?
16:56:47 <wagle> (i'm waiting for the =haskell email)
17:07:22 <jadrian> wagle: ghci
17:07:27 <jadrian> ghc/ghci
17:07:37 <jadrian> I haven't touched hugs in a few years
17:12:39 <wagle> jeez.  how long does posting to =haskell usually take?
17:14:03 <jadrian> wagle: I already got both my emails...
17:14:34 <jadrian> wagle: and I got each just a few seconds after sending them...
17:15:14 <jadrian> wagle: wait
17:15:15 <wagle> Sender: haskell-bounces@haskell.org
17:15:17 <wagle> ?
17:15:24 <jadrian> wagle: I sent to haskell *cafe*
17:15:33 <wagle> ah
17:15:34 <jadrian> wagle: are you subscribed to haskell-cafe
17:15:37 <jadrian> ?
17:15:38 <wagle> nope
17:15:50 <wagle> bwahaha
17:15:53 <jadrian> it would probably be a good idea
17:16:37 <jadrian> my guess is that you'd probably be more interested in that discussion than in the haskell one
17:17:22 <jadrian> http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe
17:17:40 <jadrian> wagle: http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-December/008039.html  <-- my question
17:17:49 <wagle> already there
17:18:04 <jadrian> wagle: and I answered myself with a 2nd example
17:18:47 <wagle> i think Sheard's "omega" does the equality stuff
17:18:59 <jadrian> no idea what that is
17:19:09 <jadrian> is it a language?
17:19:19 <wagle> google for sheard omega
17:20:19 <wagle> the idea is that he's doing it because it couldnt be done (correctly?) before
17:20:30 <jadrian> right
17:21:00 <wagle> and he's getting a lot of milage out of adding equality constraints
17:21:06 <jadrian> yeap
17:21:20 <jadrian> I'm looking at a paper about it
17:21:43 <jadrian> just a few days ago I also thought if it would be possible to do something like
17:22:07 <jadrian> type T = \a -> Either a Int
17:22:12 <jadrian> opss
17:22:23 <jadrian> nevermind
17:22:25 <jadrian> that would be
17:22:32 <jadrian> type T a = Either a Int
17:22:33 <jadrian> eh
17:22:37 <jadrian> still 
17:22:51 <jadrian> I can do this by defining a type synonyms only
17:22:56 <jadrian> not at the signature level
17:24:01 <jadrian> brb
17:24:03 <wagle> why do you need anonymous type functions?
17:28:01 <jdrake> Is there anyone here in britain?
17:29:25 <Igloo> Yes
17:29:37 <Igloo> Hmm, what's the right Makefile deps for recursive modules?
17:30:44 <Igloo> Argh, hate hate
17:30:51 <ibid> the hi-boot importing module should probably depend on the hi-boot; the hi-boot module should probably depend on the other module as normal
17:30:55 <dons> make it depend on the .hi-boot file
17:31:06 <dons> Yi/Buffer.o : ./Yi/Undo.hi-boot
17:31:11 <jdrake> Is it true that gas there costs about 80p per litre?
17:31:29 <jdrake> (and that 100p = a pound)
17:31:30 <Igloo> Is that right? What if the implementation changes so something inilned changes?
17:31:46 <Igloo> But the type hasn't changed so the .hi-boot hasn't changed
17:32:06 <ibid> Igloo: the hi-boot-importing method cannot use anything not in the hi-boot
17:32:08 <dons> but the .hi-boot isn't machine generated..
17:32:14 <ibid> hmm, sorry
17:32:38 <dons> anyway, what does ghc -M -optdep-f say?
17:32:46 <Igloo> dons: Why is that relevant?
17:32:46 <dons> it's pretty smart with these things
17:33:03 <Igloo> ghc -M doesn't do anything special for recursive modules AFAICT
17:33:04 <dons> maybe I misunderstand
17:33:22 <dons> it handles .hi-boots, at least
17:33:47 <dons> I have had several recursive modules at times in yi, and ghc dumped out the proper depends quite nicely
17:33:47 <Igloo> Oh. I'll try a testcase to see if I screwed up then
17:36:38 <Igloo> OK, ghc -M is depending on the .hi-boot, so I must have screwed something up
17:36:49 <Igloo> I still don't see that it is correct, though
17:38:53 <dons> can you break it using explicit INLINEs or -O1/-Onot ?
17:39:23 <Igloo> I'll give that a go once I've worked out why it's not even trying for darcs  :-)
17:40:17 <Igloo> Ah, I have the pragma on the wrong side of the module name
17:40:30 <dons> now, why don't we have happy magic recursive modules in ghc?
17:40:37 <dons> what would have to be done?
17:40:51 <dons> could we tag the .hi file somehow, to break the loop?
17:44:25 <dons> "The precise details of separate compilation are not defined by this report" :/
17:44:53 <dons> I wonder what the design space for proper mutually recursive modules looks like
17:51:31 <Igloo> Ah, OK, it's safe because GHC doesn't inline things from {-# SOURCE #-}-imported modules
17:52:48 <dons> ah. ok. that's reasonable :)
17:53:00 <Igloo> Yeah
17:54:05 <Igloo> Do you know what this mean? tcLookupGlobal (id): `PatchRepresentation.$fShowPatch' is not in scope
17:54:42 * Igloo is particularly confused by the capitalised S
17:57:31 <Igloo> Hmm, and do .hi-boot-{5,6} refer to GHC versions?
17:57:38 <dons> I believe so, yes
17:59:49 <dons> $f is the prefix for a "dict-fun identifiers (from inst decls)"
18:00:15 <dons> basicTypes/OccName.lhs
18:01:29 <Igloo> Right, compiling from scratch without profiling looks like it's going to work
18:01:48 <Igloo> But I can't make my testcase fail with profiling
18:13:17 <Igloo> OK, works with profiling too. Must have just been a conflicting old .hi file
18:15:34 <np_hard> who goes here?
18:17:06 <np_hard> MegaMonad: why is programming in Java so painful?
18:17:13 <MegaMonad> np_hard: Programming is the most general inferred types are painful to do java.
18:52:46 <jdrake> Is there such a thing as a functional language that doesn't have a lambda symbol in its logo?
18:53:44 <Riastradh> What do you define as a language's logo?
18:58:10 <Philippa> jdrake: there might be if I bothered designing a logo for Tyop...
18:58:30 <jdrake> something prominately displayed on a website such as this: http://haskell.org/HaskellLogo_2.jpg
18:59:41 <Riastradh> Given how fundamental lambda is to functional languages, probably not.
19:01:06 <jdrake> I also have my SOE book today
19:01:12 <np_hard> http://www.erlang.org/ , for some value of "functional"
19:02:05 <Philippa> Riastradh: it's less fundamental for compositional (as opposed to applicative) functional languages
19:02:14 <Riastradh> Unlambda doesn't count.
19:02:23 <Philippa> Joy?
19:02:26 <Riastradh> (And anyway, it has 'lambda' in its name!)
19:02:48 <Riastradh> Joy is a side-effectless concatenative language, not a functional language.
19:02:56 * Riastradh must depart now.
19:03:01 <np_hard> is there a better language than Haskell in which to do generic programming?
19:03:24 <jdrake> C?
19:34:50 <Lemmih> Good morning, SyntaxNinja.
19:34:55 <SyntaxNinja> hi Lemmih
19:36:03 <SyntaxNinja> so Ross patterson says: 'I think this is where I'm supposed to mutter "sometimes it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken"' and then proceeds to harass me about my keep-it-simple-stupid policy toward cabal
19:36:27 <SyntaxNinja> I don't quite know what that tender chicken comment is supposed to mean, but I think he's trying to hurt my feelings.
19:39:07 <irce> :)
19:40:46 <SyntaxNinja> so I thought I'd come on here and vent rather than feed the troll on the mailing list.
19:40:57 <SyntaxNinja> MegaMonad: sometimes it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken
19:41:03 <MegaMonad> SyntaxNinja: Man man i think it is better tough.
19:41:21 <SyntaxNinja> so megamonad likes tough chickens, it seems.
19:42:36 <SyntaxNinja> aj: still learning Haskell?
19:55:53 <Philippa> MegaMonad: do you eat chickens, or do something else?
19:55:59 <MegaMonad> Philippa: Did you eat chickens, or do you want to be me not use any of those i looked it over mutt!
19:57:28 <SyntaxNinja> MegaMonad: what do chickens have to do with unicycles?
19:57:34 <MegaMonad> SyntaxNinja: Oh, you have two unicycles, and mountain unicycles.
20:06:21 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/repos/hackage/
20:20:46 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: thanks. do you want me to link to that, or copy it?
20:22:42 <wolfman8k> anyone know anything about Binghamton University?
20:23:06 <Lemmih> SyntaxNinja: Whatever you see fit.
20:24:01 <Lemmih> There's no specific reason to keep it with the rest of the repo.
20:25:16 <SyntaxNinja> decisions decisions 
20:25:55 <Lemmih> I think it would be nicest if you copy it.
20:26:02 <SyntaxNinja> OK.
20:26:19 <SyntaxNinja> I'll stick it under the cabal page.
20:27:15 <Lemmih> I better go unicycle before the people with cars wake up.
20:27:49 <SyntaxNinja> Lemmih: yes.  there should be a time period where no one is allowed to drive cars.
20:27:52 <SyntaxNinja> every day, I mean.
20:28:11 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I figured out what is up with hppa
20:28:24 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: cabal isn't building there because igloo asked for it not to be
20:28:31 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: <cheesy voice>my hearo</cheesy voice>
20:28:35 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: he did that because he wants ghc6 to be removed there
20:28:35 <CosmicRay> hehe
20:28:36 <SyntaxNinja> that Igloo!!
20:28:59 <CosmicRay> either that, or because it's sitting in dep-wait on ghc5 due to that dependency in an earlier version
20:29:14 <CosmicRay> I'm not sure which, but in any case, it won't matter if ftpmaster ever actually gets it removed
20:29:27 <SyntaxNinja> so as usual, I need to poke the ftpmasters?
20:29:45 <SyntaxNinja> "oh ftpmasters, my packages are in increasingly bad shape approaching the release and it all depends on you."
20:31:10 <CosmicRay> hm, I'm a little confused, I'm only seeing ftp.debian.org bugs for mips...
20:31:22 <CosmicRay> best to double-check with igloo first :-)
20:32:03 <CosmicRay> if they ever do get around to fixing a problem after 2 years, and you were wrong to poke them, it'll take 3 years next time :-)
20:32:29 <SyntaxNinja> yeah I know.
20:33:29 <SyntaxNinja> it's a no-win situation. I wish I was still a brand-new maintainer rather than just a pretty-new maintainer, I could get away with asking more dumb questions.
20:36:20 <CosmicRay> feh, you can't avoid getting flamed in debian
20:36:52 <SyntaxNinja> yeah
20:36:55 <CosmicRay> hot-babe is barely lukewarm compared to some flamewars.
20:37:03 * SyntaxNinja rolls eyes
20:37:24 <CosmicRay> yeah
20:37:27 <CosmicRay> lkml is even worse
20:37:29 <SyntaxNinja> when I see a huge wad of new messages in my devel inbox, the firsthing I do is look for the flame war so I can delete it.
20:37:44 <CosmicRay> all you have to do is say "mcvoy" and you've generated a gig of mail
20:37:58 <CosmicRay> ok, so thta was a *slight* exaggeration :-)
20:38:11 <CosmicRay> (mcvoy is the bitkeeper guy)
20:38:44 <SyntaxNinja> heh. I know. I've gotten some interesting emails from him
20:39:16 * CosmicRay hasn't had the pleasure
20:39:24 <SyntaxNinja> you may remember this thread: http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/3/5/204
20:39:35 <SyntaxNinja> that is the club I started as an undergrad, though I didn't have much to do with the letter.
20:39:43 <CosmicRay> grin
20:40:28 * CosmicRay likes how Cox misspeled his own name at http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/3/5/245
20:41:37 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I still remember the first flamewar I started.  It was 1994 or 1995ish, and I was just getting interested in Unix.  I posted on whatever the netbsd newbies list was at the time, asking a few questions about how it differed from openbsd
20:41:49 <CosmicRay> that was shortly after Yet Another Spat With Theo, apparently
20:42:07 <CosmicRay> he replied to my message, starting up a massive flamewar, and everyone considerately cc'd me
20:42:35 <CosmicRay> for about 3 years after that, every 6 months or so, I'd get an automated message from him reminding me that I'm still in his blacklist filter.
20:42:35 <SyntaxNinja> haha
20:43:12 <Gahhh> heh
20:43:17 <SyntaxNinja> I replied to one of lmvy's messages, not really realizing who he was, off-list to try to get him to calm down and see things our way, and he basically threatened to sue me and the club.
20:43:25 <SyntaxNinja> since then, I try not to mention him in public ;)
20:43:28 <CosmicRay> heh
20:43:45 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: train megamonad to do your bidding for you? :-)
20:44:09 <Gahhh> MegaMonad: freebsd > linux ?
20:44:11 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: do you hate Bitkeeper as much as everyone else hates Bitkeeper and thinks Bitkeeper is evil and Bitkeeper is bad?
20:44:15 <MegaMonad> Gahhh: N0t until you understand why it's currently broken on freebsd too, so they'd have to see how others have looked at that conclusion if you can't use alex for the linux kernel 2.6 linux.
20:44:21 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: (Me is not clear to everybody that thinks the same model as bitkeeper.
20:44:51 <SyntaxNinja> BITKEEPER ISN'T BROKEN, PREPARE TO BE SUED!!
20:45:02 <CosmicRay> hehe
20:45:22 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: and you're doubly in for it, having made positive comments about a competing version control system
20:45:41 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: and you may have even USED or -- parish the thought -- DEVELOPED a competing version control system
20:45:52 <CosmicRay> err, wrong perish.
20:46:03 <CosmicRay> oh whell, McVoy sounds Catholic :-)
20:46:47 <SyntaxNinja> how do I get lambdabot to talk again?
20:47:05 <SyntaxNinja> @commands
20:47:05 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "commands", try "lambdabot: @listcommands
20:47:08 <CosmicRay> and I'm sure that Larry would consider the VMS filesystem to be a competing version control system since it would append ";x" after hacked files
20:47:12 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I think that was shapr
20:47:51 <SyntaxNinja> hmm.
20:48:11 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: you know, it's about time for me to bring up my semi-annual "abolish non-free" general resolution in Debian :-)
20:48:38 <SyntaxNinja> oh my
20:48:40 <CosmicRay> heh
20:49:20 <SyntaxNinja> I'm personally glad that the community wants to get rid of non-free docs and firmware and such
20:49:22 <Riastradh> CosmicRay, well, duh, it stores version information, so therefore it is a versioning system!
20:49:31 <CosmicRay> http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2000/06/msg00000.html
20:49:34 <CosmicRay> Riastradh: heh
20:51:00 <Gahhh> yay. emacs is going nuts on me.
20:51:10 <CosmicRay> that's better than vi going nuts.
20:51:25 <CosmicRay> I always hate it when vi goes nuts
20:51:28 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: you're a sucker for punishment.
20:51:32 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: heh
20:51:38 <Riastradh> I like nuts.
20:51:49 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I learned my lesson after the second time I brought it up
20:51:58 <SyntaxNinja> "abolish non-free" ... "president: spi" ... "learn haskel" ... ;)
20:51:58 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: I encoureaged other people to after that :-)
20:52:03 <Riastradh> They're crunchy & tasty.  They're marvellous to munch on loudly & rudely during conversations such as these.
20:52:03 <CosmicRay> haha
20:52:18 <CosmicRay> Riastradh: what nuts in specific?
20:52:37 <SyntaxNinja> btw, I decided today that reading Haskell code with c-preprocessor junk in it is like walking through the park on a sunny day and seeing a dead animal on the trail.
20:52:39 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: "package... cabal"
20:52:40 * CosmicRay hides
20:52:48 <SyntaxNinja> hey! cabal is lovely.
20:52:53 <SyntaxNinja> except for the cpp stuff.
20:53:11 <Philippa> Riastradh: doesn't the person the nuts're attached to complain?
20:53:12 <CosmicRay> you're right, it was an easy package
20:53:28 <CosmicRay> Philippa: UNWANTED MENTAL IMAGE!
20:53:46 * SyntaxNinja reads last few remarks in reverse order, aparently stops himself in time.
20:53:57 <CosmicRay> heh
20:54:01 <Gahhh> Syntax: it's a friday night
20:54:09 <CosmicRay> and we're all ircing.
20:54:13 * Riastradh munches on inappropriate nuts inappropriately and lets everyone nearby decide how they'd like to interpret the inappropriateness & form their own mental images.
20:54:16 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: yeah?  well, I just moved here, so I have no friends.
20:54:19 <Gahhh> I'll soom go out to a bar
20:54:25 <Gahhh> Where ninja ?
20:54:26 <CosmicRay> heh
20:54:30 <SyntaxNinja> portland, OR
20:54:33 <Gahhh> ah
20:54:38 <Gahhh> Bay Area, CA
20:54:47 <SyntaxNinja> oh, I'm going to be there next weekend.
20:54:52 <CosmicRay> a bar.  I'd have to go into town, and then over to the next town, to get to one of those... :-)
20:55:02 <Philippa> Riastradh: so long as you agreed on a safeword first...
20:55:04 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: you should come to a cooler part of the country.
20:55:10 <Gahhh> Syntax: business trip ?
20:55:16 <SyntaxNinja> heh Philippa is getting kinky on us
20:55:19 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: too many people
20:55:30 <Philippa> SyntaxNinja: "getting"? Somebody hasn't been paying attention...
20:55:33 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: business in monterrey, then some fun in SanJose, seeing old friends.
20:55:39 * CosmicRay likes living in a place where our 1/3 mile driveway is about average
20:55:46 <SyntaxNinja> Philippa: ;)
20:55:49 * Riastradh transmits the thought of intense masculine pain across IRC somehow as he chews.
20:55:54 <CosmicRay> heh
20:55:55 <Gahhh> Cool. I work in San Jose.
20:56:08 * Riastradh blames Philippa for this insanity.
20:56:24 * Gahhh is ignoring Phillippa for his own sanity
20:56:38 <Riastradh> Good plan.  Too late for most of us, though.
20:56:46 <Gahhh> let me use magic on you
20:57:02 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: take care of riastradh for us, please
20:57:05 * Gahhh casts spell of gigantic proportions
20:57:08 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Tz=eet-2dst,m3.5.0,m10.5.0   isn't that pretty much how i'd link it to riastradh.
20:57:12 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: I used to work there, for a summer at Cisco
20:57:25 <Gahhh> lol mega
20:57:30 <Gahhh> I seriously read that
20:57:33 <CosmicRay> hehe
20:57:36 <Gahhh> and thought about GPS coordinates
20:58:10 <CosmicRay> anyone here a geocacher?
20:58:42 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you frightened me there; I thought someone real had said that for a moment.
20:58:48 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: No you people are simply frightened by the thought is that a less interesting than zope.
20:58:56 <CosmicRay> heh
20:58:56 <Gahhh> lol
20:59:23 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you'd better be careful about insulting Zope: shapr might be around, and I don't think he'd like that!
20:59:29 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: I'd think a lot in modern compilers, for example, would just have to have distinct successes and failures, but the f-omega-sub treatment, which is insulting.
20:59:32 <CosmicRay> shapr likes zope?
20:59:35 <SyntaxNinja> now the party's heating up...
20:59:45 <Gahhh> isnt zope in python ?
20:59:48 <CosmicRay> yes
20:59:54 <Gahhh> then he may
20:59:55 <Riastradh> At least, I think he uses Zope
20:59:56 <Riastradh> .
21:00:00 <CosmicRay> ahh.
21:00:05 <CosmicRay> finally a chink in his armor
21:00:08 <CosmicRay> I knew something was wrong
21:00:19 <Gahhh> I like C++
21:00:26 * Gahhh feigns death
21:00:38 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, what is the f-omega-sub treatment in the context of modern compilers for distinct successes & failures to insult examples?
21:00:45 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Examples should probably have a context for the failures.
21:01:05 <Gahhh> is that a single sentence ?
21:01:26 <Riastradh> Yes, both what I said & what MegaMonad said are single, complete, well-formed sentences.
21:01:31 <Gahhh> he usually combines several and breaks the grammar
21:01:39 <Gahhh> err it
21:01:43 <Riastradh> (perhaps not with much sense to them, but they are grammatically valid!)
21:01:59 <Gahhh> I am going to speak like MegaMonad
21:02:03 <Gahhh> ask me something
21:02:06 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you created a grammatically valid sentence: what an achievement!
21:02:20 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Btw it is valid in a sentence.
21:02:26 <Gahhh> lol
21:02:35 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: does it take a hard man to make a tender chicken?
21:02:57 <Philippa> no, but it'll help with the sauce
21:03:09 <Gahhh> SyntaxNinja: I have read the paper by Wadler is that a free variable shapr ?
21:03:47 <Riastradh> Gahhh, no, no, no.  You're doing it all wrong.  It has to include at least _some_ of the words in some context that SyntaxNinja said.
21:03:52 <Riastradh> For example:
21:03:56 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, no, no, no.  You're doing it all wrong.  It has to include at least _some_ of the words in some context that SyntaxNinja said.
21:04:01 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Syntaxninja seems to be the one who indicated you need to put words on the context.
21:04:02 <Gahhh> ah yes
21:04:16 <Riastradh> See?  SyntaxNinja, words, context.
21:04:28 <Gahhh> unfortunately I dont remember a particular discussion involving hard men, chicken, et al.
21:04:37 <CosmicRay> gah: hahahaha
21:04:46 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, have you read the paper by Wadler that is a free variable?
21:04:51 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: (Me is not worth it a wadler?
21:04:54 <SyntaxNinja> Gahhh: hehe
21:05:03 <SyntaxNinja> gahh: you haven't been reading the libraries list! ;)
21:05:06 <Gahhh> see it's not worth a Wadler
21:05:16 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, unfortunately, I don't remember a particular discussion involving hard men, chicken, et cetera.
21:05:22 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Its hard to remember all the discussion.
21:05:29 <Gahhh> wow
21:05:37 <Gahhh> so many complete sentences tonite
21:05:46 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you have been constructing many grammatically valid, and some even _sensical_, sentences!  You're amazing!
21:05:52 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: In this case, "things" is let expressions for an update rather than me to be valid in a few sentences.
21:05:55 <Gahhh> he picks up bad habits, tho. Its vs It's, etc.
21:06:13 <CosmicRay> well, is *is* trained based on irc conversations
21:06:21 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, well, that can be blamed upon all those who have bad habits here in the first place.  I, therefore, am perfect.
21:06:23 <CosmicRay> it's a tribute to this channel that he doesn't use l33tsp33k
21:06:27 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Shapr disappears to get you the first would be perfect.
21:06:37 <Gahhh> CosmicRay: Yes
21:06:41 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, (see, it's a lot more fun when you address all your comments directly to MegaMonad).
21:06:49 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Have fun at the address of the code directly.
21:06:53 <Gahhh> lol
21:06:55 <Riastradh> All of your non-trivial comments, that is.
21:07:06 <CosmicRay> argh.  it smells like a skunk over here
21:07:13 <Philippa> MegaMonad: non-triviality
21:07:19 <MegaMonad> Philippa: ?Ip_version is a very difficult time seeing the triviality i am familar with fold and a non-monad function.
21:07:40 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: any skunk-banishing advice?
21:07:46 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Before banishing him to use any of the advice of the arguments.
21:08:03 <Riastradh> Come on: you have to seed him with more interesting sentences than _that_.
21:08:07 <SyntaxNinja> that was close to being really funny.
21:08:29 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: I ask of you, please, give us an answer to this most vexing question:  vi or emacs?
21:08:34 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Hi - can someone answer a simple question of the same as vi.
21:08:38 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, do you have any advice to banish the evil hordes of skunks that prey upon my food and lay pestilence upon my domain?
21:08:43 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Food is a domain specific languages' shouldn't stop at two bucks that is a really evil way.
21:08:44 <CosmicRay> heh
21:09:06 <Gahhh> two bucks for food
21:09:14 <Gahhh> evil McDonalds
21:09:25 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: do you still remember that bitkeeper is evil?
21:09:28 <Gahhh> he 's speaking in code, methings
21:09:31 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: It looks to me to the evil that is the bitkeeper guy.
21:09:36 <Philippa> could be. Or you could buy ingredients for something rather a lot nicer
21:09:49 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, could be -- or you could buy ingredients for something rather a lot nicer.
21:09:55 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: I rather think it would be much nicer.
21:10:12 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, but you don't think it would be a lot nicer?  You really think it's 'much nicer?'
21:10:18 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Igloo adds it to me writing a haskell to make it nicer.
21:10:34 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.
21:10:40 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Dang too bad an attempt to _realistically_ imitate buffalo wings, it would mean some of it.
21:10:52 <Gahhh> lol
21:11:02 <Gahhh> imitation buffalo wings
21:11:06 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, damn!  You used to respond only with strings of 'buffalo' in varying lengths!  Your entry for 'buffalo' was perfect!
21:11:06 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: have you ever had a near-dev/null experience?
21:11:14 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: My use of concurrent programming is an entry for a couple of different lengths?
21:11:20 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Null is not such a program that you experience when you have i missed something.
21:11:41 <Gahhh> He sounds like the Oracle in the despicable Matrix movies
21:11:45 <CosmicRay> heh
21:11:51 <Gahhh> MegaMonad: If Larry Wall and Guido were to thumbwrestle, who would win ?
21:11:55 <waltz> despicable eh
21:12:06 <CosmicRay> Gahhh: the first one was cool
21:12:10 <MegaMonad> Gahhh: Guido has a wall the first time i checked, htey were close enough to win.
21:12:11 <waltz> Gahhh: Larry, duh.
21:12:37 <Gahhh> It said Guido would have Wall. Ergo Guido wins
21:12:50 <waltz> Why do you say that?
21:12:52 <CosmicRay> pfft.  My money's on Kernighan :-)
21:12:55 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, wave upon wave of demented avengers march cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream.
21:13:07 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: As for trek... Season3 of enterprise was the sheer act of being depended upon, but that's a ten out of obscurity into the dream.
21:13:14 <Gahhh> wow
21:13:38 <Gahhh> I'm going to use the "ten out of obscurity"
21:13:53 <CosmicRay> too bad it wasn't "7 out of obscurity" :-)
21:13:57 <Gahhh> MegaMonad: Thanks
21:14:00 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, the outer lock rolled slowly back; the servicemen where heard to sigh: for there revealed in flowing robes was Lucy in the sky.
21:14:05 <MegaMonad> Gahhh: Cybermanco : should  outqtree :: qtree -> either () (either section (coords,qtree,qtree,qtree,qtree,qtree,qtree))  ?
21:14:10 <CosmicRay> heh
21:14:11 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: I've heard it was easy, i just write do phrase <- readln;putstrln phrase, phrase has to be rolled out of the lock.
21:15:13 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: foo
21:15:19 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Works for me", and they'll get involved if i should write a program for non-mathematical applications.  Darcs is a libhaskell-foo2 and libhaskell-foo3 package? (2, 3 Are major library versions.
21:15:27 <Gahhh> too easy
21:15:31 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: bar
21:15:38 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Syntaxninja maybe it's a value of type a, which of regex1..3 do i convert "myfoo :: bar b => attr a b" to define a new line below it up later.
21:15:42 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: so megamonad, is your monad really all that mega?
21:15:48 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: D0pd0pd0p: it isn't all that commentary, why not the right thing' by itself. It's actually my kind of ascii representation of a single monad, but it's also probably wouldn't look all that mega?
21:16:01 <Gahhh> long answer means no
21:16:05 <CosmicRay> heh
21:16:12 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, do long answers mean no?\
21:16:17 <Riastradh> Oops.
21:16:19 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Yes yes yes.
21:16:22 <Gahhh> lol
21:16:22 <CosmicRay> heh
21:16:24 <Riastradh> Haha.
21:16:46 <CosmicRay> Riastradh: and when he starts ending every response with a backslash, we'll know whom to blame :-)
21:17:01 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, gee, whom will you blame?  I can't figure it out!
21:17:07 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: I blame the programmer isn't in the figure structure is traversed for the mips in haskell.
21:17:11 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: Life is but an anonymous function.
21:17:17 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Anonymous function and a function.
21:17:21 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, I am not a Church numeral; I am a free variable!
21:17:27 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: A church is the variable with a free lunch.
21:17:32 <CosmicRay> haha
21:17:33 <Gahhh> lol
21:17:42 <Gahhh> MegaMonad: Chelsea - Arsenal ?
21:17:46 <Philippa> OK, that belongs in the quotes page :-)
21:17:50 <MegaMonad> Gahhh: You got a massive arsenal of scary theorems ?
21:17:57 <Gahhh> damn
21:17:58 <Riastradh> ...as does that!
21:18:04 <Riastradh> Maybe we need a separate MarkovQuotesPage.
21:18:05 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: If you were to kill a monad but nobody would hear, would it still be lazy?
21:18:11 <Philippa> MegaMonad: Man United - Arsenal?
21:18:12 <CosmicRay> Riastradh: @wiki MegaMonad
21:18:17 <CosmicRay> @wiki MegaMonad
21:18:17 <Philippa> (wonder if we can get a dodgy one out of that)
21:18:17 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MegaMonad
21:18:21 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: I hear it is lazy.
21:18:27 <MegaMonad> Philippa: This paper, though, has a massive arsenal of scary category theoretical crud don't belong in the united states.
21:18:34 <CosmicRay> haha
21:18:43 <Gahhh> lol
21:18:53 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what, did bush ban category theory?
21:18:57 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you're making my chest hurt from heavy laughter; I'm having difficulty breathing because of you!
21:19:03 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Igloo: i can ban the whole theory of the value category.
21:19:09 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: The difficulty is that you mean, because the channel topic wouldn't hurt...
21:19:18 <Gahhh> CsomicRay: either you're with us, or you know category theory ?
21:19:24 <CosmicRay> lol
21:19:58 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, summoning his cosmic powers and glowing slightly from his toes, his psychic emanations flowed!
21:20:04 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Cosmic: oh, that makes sense in a slightly different case for why some of his to a new release of self? Who? Where? Which platform?
21:20:16 <Gahhh> hey, Cosmic's been quoted
21:20:20 <Gahhh> oh
21:20:27 <Gahhh> no, he was the recipient
21:20:33 <CosmicRay> no, riastradh was
21:20:49 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: am I really that inquisitive?
21:20:55 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Who started it, if it interests you you should know you can't say that it's good to look for the vector part, and this one single function definition that i really that inquisitive?
21:20:59 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, OK, I'm out of here.  I can't take any more of this.  I'll be asphyxiated if I continue.
21:21:05 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: You're a good way to go. I'll be asphyxiated if i continue.
21:21:14 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: asphyxiated
21:21:20 <Gahhh> thats plagiarism ladies and gents
21:21:20 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Looks like i'll have to go. I'll be asphyxiated if i ran that in.
21:21:28 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: asphyxiated
21:21:34 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: First you'll have to go. I'll be asphyxiated if i can never keep foldr straight.
21:21:41 <CosmicRay> hahaha
21:21:41 <Gahhh> lol
21:21:44 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: asphyxiated
21:21:59 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Time to make sure of this. I'll be asphyxiated if i can fix the famously broken bits, you can't.
21:22:02 <Gahhh> hmm
21:22:11 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, you're too slow.  Tell your creator to improve your performance.
21:22:22 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Neil armstrong was the creator of this stuff might get too far out of the performance it gets to using sourceforge (more control i guess i could improve?
21:22:30 <CosmicRay> neil armstrong?
21:22:32 <CosmicRay> wonder where he got that
21:22:33 <Gahhh> wow
21:22:56 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, a pox upon you!  I really shall be asphyxiated if I proceed!  Begone, vile fiend!
21:22:58 <Gahhh> at least, it's a tribute to this channel that it didnt mention Paris Hilton, et al.
21:23:02 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Has any of you from the run-time system stumbles upon the right way and i'm not sure how to proceed.
21:23:07 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, Paris Hilton
21:23:14 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Paris hilton vs paris hilton.
21:23:17 <Gahhh> lol
21:23:24 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, Paris Hilton vs Paris Hilton?
21:23:26 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: video
21:23:30 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: But vs is very different from, but checking the authority portion of books on saturday night live sketch with miss hilton?
21:23:36 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Yeah, finland has the video for windows and it took 1.2s.
21:23:42 <Gahhh> miss hilton ?
21:23:43 <Riastradh> MegaMonad: defenestrate!
21:23:54 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: 1. F is already loaded, because it's really slow... :( But that's just because you forgot to give me more info.
21:23:55 <Philippa> no thanks, much as it sucks I /need/ this OS
21:24:09 * Riastradh vanishes in a *whoosh*.
21:24:14 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what do you think of Windows?
21:24:20 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: I come back to me is that if you think of windows?
21:24:31 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: is windows more or less evil than java?
21:24:37 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: If i may be an evil thing that is what java is even evil to do is mixing programs and libraries (packages) (especially in windows).  It's hard to find.
21:24:51 <Gahhh> sounds like a consultant
21:24:56 <CosmicRay> heh
21:25:08 <CosmicRay> a "BS your way through everything" consultant at that
21:25:12 <CosmicRay> hate those
21:25:20 <Gahhh> MegaMonad: Is it true that Bill Gates cannot foldr his way out of a paper bag ?
21:25:26 <MegaMonad> Gahhh: So all you need to be an a in the gates of the bag"?
21:26:07 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: simon
21:26:13 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Hws by simon thompson.
21:26:17 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: simon
21:26:23 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Earthy: i will ask sebc when he is simon^4 or simon^5...
21:26:32 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: shapr shapr shapr
21:26:37 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Thebug hands shapr a stuffed s-expression might not even *use* other compilers.
21:26:49 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: google
21:26:55 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: And this definition just not to just google.
21:27:06 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what is enlightenment?
21:27:12 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Percolate the enlightenment libs?
21:27:16 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what is life?
21:27:21 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: The shlibs file part of some other unicyclists. I've never investigated them. What's up with some windowy bindings, and just noticed there is no life/death situation so i don't see why peopel do that !
21:27:32 <CosmicRay> haha
21:27:35 <Gahhh> geez
21:27:36 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what is death?
21:27:50 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: [|1|] Gives you an input on stdin and told me to death!
21:27:58 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what is happiness?
21:28:03 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Derelm: except i'm supposed to recognize it as a rule, bring about greatest happiness -- would of course an accumulator?
21:28:12 <CosmicRay> haha
21:28:18 <CosmicRay> so he's a haskell utilitarian!
21:33:46 <Gahhh> Emacs is about to die
21:35:53 <CosmicRay> I hate people that send word attachments in leiu of an e-mail body
21:36:19 <Philippa> I don't. It's a useful way of spotting fuckwits who aren't worth dealing with :-)
21:36:23 <CosmicRay> hehe
22:19:03 <yrlnry> I just did a Perl implementation of monads.
22:19:16 <yrlnry> Yipes.
22:19:55 <Philippa> funny, we were talking about masochism earlier...
22:20:08 <SyntaxNinja> 'we'
22:20:12 <Philippa> :-)
22:20:12 <SyntaxNinja> ;)
22:20:23 <yrlnry> My code got a lot tidier once I realized that in Perl you don't need >>=; you can get away with just >>.
22:20:25 <Philippa> nah, Riastradh was joining in. In fairness everybody else was wincing...
22:20:41 <yrlnry> It's still not great, but it's not awful either.
22:20:55 <SyntaxNinja> how do you sequence monads that return values, then?
22:21:30 <yrlnry> SyntaxNinja: Assign the value to a block-local variable, analogous to the Haskell "do p <- e" notation.
22:21:43 <yrlnry> Except you use an assignment.
22:22:02 <yrlnry> The assignment is private to the block, so it doesn't mess up referential transparency.
22:22:35 <dons> is it a short implementation?
22:22:49 <yrlnry> http://www.plover.com/~mjd/misc/perl/monads/
22:24:01 <yrlnry> http://www.plover.com/~mjd/misc/perl/monads/first-cut.pl is my first attempt.  You don't want to look at that, unless you realy *are* a masochist.  :)
22:26:15 <Philippa> it's perl, I don't want to look :-)
22:26:32 <yrlnry> Do I get the insane freak award for the evening?
22:26:59 <SyntaxNinja> MegaMonad: does yrinry get the insane freak award for the evening?
22:27:04 <MegaMonad> SyntaxNinja: Stepcut; i quite agree.  You'd be insane to have in your .emacs! Very, um, futuristic. I like the same sort of award for the evening?
22:27:20 <SyntaxNinja> the MegaMonad has spoken.
22:27:32 <yrlnry> What's that?  Dissociated press or something like it?
22:30:09 <SyntaxNinja> He's our oracle.  you may question him, but you must not doubt.
22:30:44 * yrlnry chuckles.
22:30:52 <Lemmih> MegaMonad: Will Haskell ever achieve world domination?
22:30:57 <MegaMonad> Lemmih: If they have the cool thing is, you can achieve the same star^h^h^h^htype, but perhaps a bit more concurrency/commutativity of world domination.
22:31:20 <yrlnry> I hear and I attend, O mighty oracle.
22:31:36 <yrlnry> Do newbies ever come on-channel and get into conversations with it?
22:31:55 <SyntaxNinja> not yet. it's pretty new.
22:32:07 <yrlnry> It is very fine.
22:32:08 <SyntaxNinja> you have to address it for it to start replying.
22:32:27 <yrlnry> Probably a good thing.
22:32:30 <SyntaxNinja> I was trying to get someone to make it trigger on questions every so often so that newbies might get confused.
22:39:14 <Philippa> MegaMonad, what is your purpose?
22:39:20 <MegaMonad> Philippa: Now my question, if my functions the compiler know if you've got things that only go out and ask me if my server program, but that gets you a general purpose simd, so it is that the output of --version.
23:24:06 <Lemmih> Darn. I found another bug in HaskellDB.
