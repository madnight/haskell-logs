00:03:22 <irce> why is a predefined list [Integer] and a list returned from a func type [Int] ?
00:03:43 <Cale> irce: hm?
00:04:17 <Cale> Integer is for arbitrary-sized integers, and Int is for machine sized integers
00:08:17 <irce> jep, so defined. finelist = [1,2] should be [Int] then 
00:10:08 <Lemmih> No. That would be :: (Num a) => [a]
00:10:45 <Lemmih> @type [1,2]
00:10:46 <lambdabot> [1,2] :: forall t. (Num t) => [t]
00:12:57 <irce> ok. now it worked when i replaced my list in the code with hardcoded list [1,2] insted of using defined variable finelist = [1,2]   
00:17:03 <Lemmih> It sounds like you were trying to use finelist as both a list of Ints and a list of Integers.
00:30:24 <irce> maybe
00:48:43 <icct> can someone explain what is the point of duplicating tail,head,map and other prelude's funcs in Data.List?
00:49:22 <Cale> they're not duplicated, they're defined there, and imported by the prelude
00:49:23 <Lemmih> icct: Prelude is just re-exporting those functions.
00:49:58 <icct> oh, i see. tnx.

01:32:02 <dblhelix> MegaMonad: well, okay then
01:32:07 <MegaMonad> dblhelix: Cedricshock: is abstract algebra okay?
01:44:59 <esap> MegaMonad: how about category theory?
01:45:05 <MegaMonad> esap: The zeta lemma of category theory teacher dissed type theory, but in theory you should be more exact.
01:45:28 <esap> MegaMonad: zeta lemma?
01:45:34 <MegaMonad> esap: Aarne wrote a parser library. On the mac. Who was that lemma? I have to import a datastructure, it's there, is that the goal is understanding the yoneda lemma is the critical path for statistics.

02:05:30 <bourbaki> :)
02:05:47 <bourbaki> xerox what kind of stuff do you programm?
02:07:31 <xerox> Hm.. In Haskell i mainly program exercises' solutions for the book i'm reading ;-)
02:08:30 <bourbaki> hehe ah so youre learning haskell?
02:09:15 <xerox> I'm trying, but sometimes the math-like syntax fool me :-)
02:09:40 <bourbaki> :) heh do you learn it just for fun or for uni?
02:10:03 <xerox> Fun!
02:10:27 <xerox> What about you?
02:22:31 <bourbaki> im doing haskell for fun and for uni :)
02:22:42 <bourbaki> that is  i learn it on my own and use it for my thesis
02:22:59 <xerox> Are you the raytracer guy?
02:26:32 <bourbaki> nope
02:32:06 <bourbaki> the raytracer guy or at least one of them is boegel
02:34:43 <xerox> Ah! :-)
02:38:01 <xerox> Hiya TheHunter
02:38:39 <TheHunter> morning xerox 
02:39:05 <bourbaki> moin
02:39:19 <bourbaki> TheHunter: ive done something again on my thesis stuff

03:24:15 <bourbak1> wb TheHunter :)
03:41:43 <Lemmih> Sunday is a slow day.
03:44:52 <bourbak1> :)
05:01:00 <shapr> good afternoon!
05:01:39 <shapr> anything exciting happening?
05:02:35 <shapr> MegaMonad: how's code?
05:02:41 <MegaMonad> shapr: You could do video-in, but found instead i can make a hello world code i have some haskell code that actually lifts some restrictions on these web pages. The published articles can be configured if you want to write threaded wxhaskell code.
05:03:27 <xerox> yay shapr!
05:03:39 <shapr> hiya xerox, how's code?
05:04:02 <xerox> gee, doin' some perl for money ^_^
05:04:58 <shapr> that's nice
05:05:08 <shapr> eating is useful.
05:06:23 <xerox> I think so.
05:09:29 <shapr> I'm definitely a fan. I've been eating my whole life.
05:10:07 <xerox> ahahah.

05:23:40 <lambdabot> Numeric.showHex :: forall a. (Integral a) => a -> String -> String
05:24:11 <musasabi> I need these to a performance critical part of the source so having them as literals is important.
05:25:10 <TheHunter_> Prelude> 0xffff
05:25:10 <TheHunter_> 65535
05:26:13 <musasabi> that works?! (I was thinking that it was disallowed in haskell..)
05:26:44 <TheHunter> both ghc and hugs can do it.

05:37:02 <Itkovian> Does anyone here often use records (e.g. Bin { length :: Int, width :: Int })
05:37:47 <Itkovian> I'm using several records, wherein the fields have the same name, and it is bloody annoying that ghci can't make a disticntion between them
05:39:25 * boegel is is back from dinner and feels a little tipsy because of the wine/beer
05:39:58 <shapr> Itkovian: I think most people agree with you there.
05:40:03 <shapr> I end up using unique names.
05:40:17 <boegel> Itkovian: in your example, 'length' is just syntactic sugar for a function where you of type Bin -> Int
05:40:35 <boegel> Itkovian: my raytracer code is full of it, even though I don't really use the provided functions :s
05:41:04 <TheHunter> Itkovian, sometimes putting the records in different modules and using qualified import is an option.
05:43:48 <TheHunter> (or using typeclasses and existential to simulate oo-style inheritance)
05:44:10 <shapr> Mmm, I like portishead. Especially the Dummy album.
05:47:53 <shapr> hoi boegel, long time no see
05:47:54 * shapr grins
05:48:21 <babybo0m> hi
05:48:23 <shapr> hoi 
05:48:24 <Itkovian> Any ideas when the Bin bin and thus bin.length kinda syntax will be usable?
05:48:29 <shapr> babybo0m: hoe gaat het?
05:48:30 <boegel> shapr: I just moved to the livng room :p
05:48:37 <shapr> boegel: long trip
05:48:42 <babybo0m> shapr goed hoor, met jou?
05:48:51 <shapr> ik ook
05:48:57 <shapr> life is good
05:49:07 <Itkovian> shapr: the correct expression would be: 'met mij ook'
05:49:11 <shapr> dang
05:49:12 <babybo0m> i'm a haskell newbie, and i'm trying to read a textfile... can i convert IO string to a normal string?
05:49:13 <shapr> thanks :-)
05:49:14 <babybo0m> :)
05:49:19 <shapr> I'm a dutch newbie...
05:49:26 <Lunar^> shapr: What is the current state of this discussions about Debian on haskell.org ?
05:49:29 <Itkovian> well, I'm a Haskell newbie ...

05:50:17 <babybo0m> thanks :)
05:50:23 <Itkovian> I'm more a newbie than most folks here
05:50:24 <Lunar^> shapr: Tell me more! :)
05:50:42 <shapr> Lunar^: I'm not sure how likely or how soon things will happen.
05:50:51 <boegel> Itkovian: I'm even more newbie than you, so you're not a newbie :p
05:51:06 <shapr> Lunar^: I'll ask people again tomorrow.
05:51:09 <Lunar^> Itkovian: Haskell community can seem a bit frightening because of its high standards, but don't worry :)
05:51:26 <Itkovian> yeah, thanks Lunar^ 
05:51:33 <Lunar^> shapr: Should we schedule an IRC meeting?
05:51:44 <shapr> I don't think that's necessary.
05:52:01 <shapr> But I'll ask around and see if the people are interested.
05:52:03 <boegel> Lunar^: won't that be kinda hard ?
05:52:25 <Lunar^> shapr: As I stated before, it could be great to have a well-defined haskell.org admin team
05:52:47 <shapr> I think it would be even better to have one person who has complete control, and then we can ask that person for final confirmation.
05:52:52 <Itkovian> anyway ... I'm off for a walk in town ...
05:52:55 <Itkovian> have fun all
05:52:57 <Lunar^> boegel: We had something really informal few weeks ago, but I think most involved folks were here
05:53:17 <Lunar^> shapr: That's not what I call reducing the bus factor but...
05:53:22 <shapr> heh
05:53:27 <boegel> bye Itkovian 
05:53:38 <shapr> thing is, that one person can delegate
05:54:00 <shapr> so if John Peterson is the "one person" he can make me the wiki guy, and you the french web pages guy.
05:54:35 <shapr> The problem with a team where no one has ultimate authority is that it usually makes things slow.
05:54:40 <Lunar^> shapr: Yes, though hackage is currently not on that box because we couldn't really do something about it because of the "one person"
05:54:47 <shapr> hm
05:55:10 <shapr> Well, we could have hackage on that box. It's just that it's a redhat box and I really don't want to maintain hackage on Redhat.
05:55:13 <Lunar^> erf! We are currently thinking opposite reason for slowlyness :)
06:04:01 * boegel is bored
06:05:05 <shapr> you want excitement?
06:05:12 <Heffalump> what is hackage?
06:05:17 <Heffalump> and are there any debs of HaskellDB around?
06:05:34 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/hackage/hackage
06:05:54 <shapr> though I now wonder if I broke it in last night's PostgreSQL upgrade.
06:05:57 <shapr> Lemmih: awake?
06:06:15 <shapr> oh, it's fine.
06:07:10 <shapr> Oh, I need to get curryspondence working by tomorrow, I need to show it off to a client.
06:07:18 <shapr> Yay, paid to work on Haskell software!
06:07:20 * shapr boings
06:07:30 <Lunar^> shapr: cool
06:07:38 <Heffalump> I'm not much more the wiser.
06:07:42 <Heffalump> and what's curryspondence?
06:07:49 * boegel should get some work done for uni, but feels to layze
06:07:59 <boegel> s/layze/lazy
06:07:59 <babybo0m> hrm... from that wikipedia page i still cant figure it out...  all i need to do is read a textfile and get the stuff into one big string... how can i do this? :)
06:08:08 <shapr> curryspondence is a mailman archive searching webapp that uses HaskellDB and PostgreSQL
06:08:40 <shapr> hackage is a Haskell library/app search webapp that takes input as cabal description files
06:08:53 <shapr> actually curryspondence should work for any mbox input, I guess.
06:09:06 <shapr> I wrote curryspondence, lemmih wrote hackage
06:10:10 <kristnjov> and i wrote python
06:11:33 <Lunar^> @type readFile
06:11:34 <lambdabot> readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
06:11:42 <Lunar^> babybo0m: This looks like what you want
06:12:12 * shapr enjoys skinnyhacking
06:13:47 <shapr> I wonder how best to write a real unicycle simulator in Haskell. Maybe Yampa?
06:13:55 <babybo0m> lambdabot yes but that would give me the IO String... i need a normal String (that's the part i can't figure out)
06:14:21 <Heffalump> did someone point you to the page about ThatAnnoyingIOType?
06:14:29 <shapr> did you read the wiki page about ThatAnnoyingIOType ?
06:14:36 <shapr> in stereo!
06:15:22 <babybo0m> yes i did... i still do not understand what i should do though :(
06:16:20 <boegel> babybo0m: you do realize lambdabot is a _bot_, not a real person ? :)

06:56:48 * basti_ .oO° ( hm. )
07:00:49 <basti_> shapr: whats the exact relation between a funktor and a monad?
07:01:02 <basti_> shapr: am i right that "funktor" is a funky definition of a monad?
07:02:00 <basti_> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/shaemax.jpg < °g°
07:03:09 <boegel> shapr: is that you ? :D
07:03:55 * boegel somehow pictured shapr differently
07:04:21 * basti_ did, too.
07:04:33 <basti_> im mean. googlestalking people.
07:13:03 <musasabi> What is the fastest way (prepackaged with GHC preferrably) to a simple imperative (IO) queue? I want to have fast insert to head and delete from tail?
07:14:24 <esap> musasabi: Control.Chan ?
07:14:33 <Heffalump> do you want linear performance or something?
07:14:39 <Heffalump> otherwise, why does it need to be imperative.
07:14:44 <Heffalump> oh, 'fast'.
07:15:28 <Heffalump> normally one inserts to the tail of a queue and deletes from the head, right? :-) But you can just switch the two.
07:15:45 * esap means Control.Concurrent.Chan obviously.
07:16:00 <Heffalump> that might have some nasty locking overhead
07:16:21 <Heffalump> you can get functional structures with amortized linear performance for doing that
07:16:44 <Heffalump> but you can occasionally get a large delay
07:16:46 <musasabi> Chan should work - I was thinking of putting some structure behind a MVar but that is even simpler.
07:17:30 <jadrian> Heffalump: are you talking about that strcuture with two Stacks when for insertion and other for removal?
07:17:38 <Heffalump> yes
07:17:45 <jadrian> right
07:18:57 * jadrian stills knows much more about imperative data structures than functional ones :-/
07:22:23 <shapr> basti_: I don't mind being googlestalked.
07:22:41 <shapr> basti_: more pix of me if you want - http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/foto/
07:24:00 <shapr> and a few really huge pix here - http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/unicycle/
07:24:06 <shapr> boegel: pix of you online?
07:27:42 <shapr> I want a windows user to send me a 56Mb avi file, but hotmail won't take that size of file, any suggestions?
07:27:44 <stepcut> my pic online :p -> http://www.n-heptane.com/nhlab/faces.gif
07:28:01 <stepcut> shapr: bittorrent :p
07:28:04 <shapr> stepcut: whoa that's COOL
07:28:14 <stepcut> hehe
07:28:28 <Heffalump> why does hotmail have to be involved?
07:28:36 <shapr> because he only has a hotmail account.
07:28:47 <shapr> And actually, I'm trying to get the file so I can host a bittorrent tracker :-)
07:28:47 <xerox> stepcut, bwhahah.
07:28:56 <tuomov> netcat
07:29:18 <Heffalump> ftp?
07:29:39 <stepcut> shapr: haha, hrm...
07:29:43 <boegel> eh, no, I don't think so
07:29:45 <boegel> there used to be, but I took em off I think
07:29:49 <boegel> let me see :)
07:29:51 <boegel> shapr: try to describe me :D
07:29:57 <boegel> why do you guys all have long hair? :D
07:30:01 <shapr> yah, ftp is probably the best choice
07:30:11 <shapr> Heffalump doesn't have long hair.
07:30:14 <stepcut> boegel: because it's cool, man!
07:30:17 <tuomov> we're all hippies?-)
07:30:24 <basti_> yes why?
07:30:26 <tuomov> (yeah, me too)
07:30:27 <shapr> tuomov: do you have long hair?
07:30:34 * stepcut goes to breakfast
07:30:34 <Heffalump> shapr: how do you know?
07:30:43 <tuomov> shapr: yep
07:30:52 <basti_> simple reason i think: we're to busy coding to visit the barber shob
07:30:53 <basti_> p
07:30:56 <basti_> pqb
07:30:59 <shapr> Heffalump: well, you didn't have long hair last time I saw you. And I suspect you haven't had enough time since then to grow it out to "long"
07:31:29 <boegel> shapr: I don't have any pics online, nor do I have one on this pc I could show you guys...
07:31:38 <shapr> ah, too bad
07:31:43 <shapr> tuomov: any pix of you online?
07:31:52 <boegel> but maybe I have one on my other pc :D
07:31:54 <boegel> brb
07:31:56 <tuomov> no
07:32:08 <tuomov> I don't think there are any that recent pics at all for that matter
07:32:37 <shapr> Maybe I'll get to meet you in person sometime :-)
07:32:44 <tuomov> maybe
07:33:09 <Heffalump> shapr: bah :-)
07:33:15 <Heffalump> you going to go to ICFP in Estonia, btw?
07:33:17 <shapr> Heffalump: does that mean I'm right? :-)
07:33:19 <shapr> yes!
07:33:39 <shapr> How many people here going to ICFP in Estonia?
07:33:54 <Heffalump> I probably will.
07:33:55 <basti_> estonia in winter? youre insane. all of you.
07:33:57 <boegel> mwoeha
07:34:04 <shapr> stepcut: that's really a marvelous gif
07:34:07 <Heffalump> it'll be next September
07:34:07 * boegel found a great pic Ã§
07:34:09 * shapr cackles happily
07:34:12 <xerox> Yes, you must do it in Italy!
07:34:27 <Heffalump> Estonia is nice and cheap.
07:34:30 <basti_> did i mention i was in australia vor vacation?
07:34:33 <basti_> and cold.
07:34:41 <xerox> and *cold*.
07:34:50 <shapr> Can't be colder than here.
07:34:59 <tuomov> it's souther than here..
07:35:02 <shapr> I was just out unicycling in -15Â° C
07:35:15 <xerox> ..
07:35:33 <shapr> I've decided that -20 or below is just too cold for unicycling.
07:35:44 <shapr> but maybe I'm being a wimp.
07:35:53 <basti_> [ ] I want to go to scanedinavia
07:35:58 <Lemmih> Hey shapr (-:
07:36:02 <shapr> hiya Lemmih!
07:36:29 <shapr> basti_: it's 'scandinavia' 
07:36:31 <boegel> shapr: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/DSC00024.JPG
07:36:40 <basti_> uhm okay.
07:36:53 <tuomov> estonia is not scandinavia
07:36:54 <boegel> I'm the one on the right :p
07:36:59 <tuomov> (and neither is finland, really)
07:37:09 <basti_> hm
07:37:10 <shapr> basti_: scannedinavian is just a funny joke name I thought up.
07:37:13 <shapr> boegel: nice
07:37:20 <boegel> :D
07:37:22 <basti_> shapr: yup i got that far. just my fingers slipped.
07:37:27 <shapr> cute horns you've got there.
07:37:32 <boegel> lemme find a 'normal' pic (if I can find one)
07:37:35 * shapr grins
07:37:52 <basti_> i got one where i'm wearing a "mind machine"
07:38:04 <basti_> (swimming glasses painted black with led's inside that blink)
07:38:11 <shapr> nifty!
07:38:28 <shapr> We are borg! Your ass will be simulated!
07:39:02 * shapr entertains himself by watching stepcut's faces gif again.
07:39:18 * boegel can't find any normal pics
07:39:26 <basti_> http://www.tanzgemein.de/irc/%21WG86Mdrogen/basti <
07:39:46 <basti_> thats 4 years ago but i didnt change that much ;)
07:39:48 <shapr> it's a borg!
07:40:06 <basti_> thats the ideal IRC pic i think =)
07:40:11 <boegel> :p
07:40:22 <shapr> boegel: what did you think I would look like?
07:40:33 <boegel> shapr, no idea actually
07:40:37 <boegel> but not hippy-like
07:40:39 <basti_> i might have been on the one or other narcotic when that was taken =)
07:40:44 <boegel> glasses, to start with
07:40:51 <boegel> but I guess you have contacts :p
07:40:54 <shapr> yup
07:40:58 <vegai> shapr: your hair *does* seem a bit grown from previous photos :)
07:41:18 <boegel> how old do you guys think I am (according to that pic)
07:41:20 <shapr> like this? http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/foto/need_haircut.jpg
07:41:25 <shapr> boegel: 23?
07:41:36 <vegai> 16-25, boegel 
07:41:51 <vegai> hiding the eyes makes it tough
07:41:59 <Heffalump> boegel: are you the one on the left or on the right?
07:42:20 <boegel> Heffalump: I said it already, on the right
07:42:20 <shapr> he must be the one on the right
07:42:28 <boegel> I was expecting that question :p
07:42:30 <shapr> what nice ears you have!
07:42:33 <boegel> vegai: 16 :o
07:42:43 <shapr> boegel: really?
07:42:56 <shapr> you're 16 now?
07:43:01 <boegel> normal pic: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/DSC00031.JPG
07:43:16 <shapr> dude, where's your horns?
07:43:18 <boegel> shapr: no, I said ':o' meaning it's rude thinking I'm 16 :p
07:43:24 <boegel> I'm 21
07:43:33 <shapr> nice hairdo
07:43:38 <boegel> shapr: have you seen 'hellboy' ?
07:43:46 <shapr> no, but I'd like to see it.
07:43:48 <boegel> shapr: it's way longer now my hair
07:43:52 <vegai> boegel: I'm 24, and the liquor store owners ask my credentials when buying wine
07:43:56 <basti_> np: Ernst Horn - Frühling
07:43:58 <boegel> but it's still pointing upwards
07:44:02 <vegai> I also don't know whether I should be offended or thankful =)
07:44:03 <boegel> vegai: heh :D
07:44:09 <shapr> vegai: pix of you online?
07:44:20 <boegel> yeah vegai, we wanna see :)
07:44:28 <vegai> http://iki.fi/vegai/pics/wed-oct-20-2004/vegai-and-agai.jpeg
07:44:43 <vegai> *my* hair is 1cm now, though :)
07:44:52 <shapr> man, it's loading slowly... you're being haskell-dotted!
07:44:59 <boegel> hmm, I would'nt ask your credentials
07:45:09 <vegai> that's coming down a 640Kbps upstream :)
07:45:10 <shapr> Is that a relative of yours?
07:45:14 <vegai> yes
07:45:17 <vegai> son
07:45:20 <shapr> wow, nifty
07:45:32 * boegel wants a daughter
07:45:38 * boegel wants twins 
07:45:41 * shapr wants lots of kids.
07:45:52 * vegai wants to sleep for a change :P
07:45:56 <shapr> hah!
07:47:15 * boegel wants to see more pics of people in here
07:47:15 * ibid wants to live long and prosper
07:47:36 * esap wants to understand ghc error messages.
07:47:37 <Heffalump> http://www.earth.li/~ganesh/ has some out of date pictures of me
07:48:00 * Riastradh wonders what people think he looks like.
07:48:03 <shapr> Heffalump: is your hair longer since last we met?
07:48:06 * basti_ wants a compiler that does what i mean.
07:48:09 <shapr> Riastradh: I think you're tall and skinny!
07:48:17 <Heffalump> how long was it then?
07:48:18 * esap is writing a compiler.
07:48:29 <basti_> one without errors?
07:48:30 <shapr> Heffalump: about like the right hand picture on your webpage.
07:48:53 <esap> basti: naah, one with so many errors you can't make mistakes :-)
07:48:58 <Heffalump> you could try http://urchin.earth.li/photopub/display?photo=/users/ganesh/banana/3357&thumb=640x640 too.
07:48:59 <ibid> here is one picture of me (taken a year ago in a pre-christmas party): http://irc-galleria.net/view.php?nick=ibid
07:49:04 * Riastradh wants a compiler that does what you didn't think of but that you now realize is really cool.
07:49:05 <Heffalump> shapr: shorter, then
07:49:35 * Heffalump likes http://urchin.earth.li/photopub/display?photo=/users/ganesh/banana/3408&thumb=640x640 but not because it's a good picture of me.
07:49:43 <Heffalump> (since it isn't)
07:49:53 <shapr> Heffalump: that's you in the pic, right?
07:50:07 <Heffalump> which one? :-)
07:50:12 <shapr> that's a pic worth a large number of geek points.
07:50:16 <Riastradh> Is that Igloo, too?
07:50:17 <shapr> winning ICFP
07:50:24 <Heffalump> on, that's Duncan Coutts
07:50:27 <Heffalump> s/on/no/
07:50:27 <shapr> ibid: man, you need a haircut too.
07:50:42 <shapr> just like me
07:50:53 <shapr> I really need to get my ends trimmed, they're starting to split.
07:50:57 <boegel> ibid: and a shave :p
07:51:01 <shapr> oh hey, pix of swiert who just left..
07:51:05 <ibid> shapr, boegel: no, i don't ;)
07:51:18 <shapr> pic of swiert: http://swierstra.tk/
07:51:37 * Riastradh splits hairs.
07:51:53 * ibid has split hairs, though
07:51:57 * basti_ will cut it off one day.
07:52:06 <shapr> I'm thinking of shaving my head.
07:52:24 <shapr> Last time I did that people said I looked like a convict or thug or some sort of criminal.
07:52:32 <basti_> i think i will lose substantial scale weight when doing that
07:52:39 <shapr> haha, good point!
07:52:47 <Heffalump> does swierstra.tk work for anyone in firefox?
07:52:49 <shapr> I'm trying to get under 92 kilos myself.
07:52:49 <basti_> not for me
07:52:53 <boegel> Heffalump: yes
07:52:55 <shapr> works for me in galeon
07:53:00 <Riastradh> Works for me in OmniWeb.
07:53:07 <ibid> i could lose some weight
07:53:08 * basti_ is 67 kilo. with hair.
07:53:10 <ibid> actually, i should
07:53:12 <shapr> man, the guy who wrote OmniWeb really pisses me off.
07:53:15 <basti_> at 1.95 height.
07:53:33 * boegel is around 70 kilo
07:53:46 <ibid> a few years ago i said on #debian-devel that if i continue growing as i did, i'd implode eventually under my own weight
07:53:47 <shapr> I was 107 kilo at the beginning of the summer, but 93 kilos now.
07:53:55 <boegel> basti_: you're quite skinny then ?
07:54:00 <basti_> yes. quite.
07:54:14 <basti_> my gf complains about the bones.
07:54:18 <shapr> I wonder how much Manuel Chakravarty weighs.
07:54:24 <shapr> Manuel has lotsa muscles.
07:54:26 <basti_> uhm
07:54:28 <ibid> i should take a nordic walk
07:54:28 <boegel> basti_: you should get rid of them then :p
07:54:31 <basti_> who?
07:54:32 <Heffalump> my gf complains about my bones too
07:54:34 <shapr> ibid: a what?
07:54:44 <shapr> my gf complains about my shoulder muscles.
07:54:52 <ibid> shapr: you didn't see any nordic walkers in your time in finland? :)
07:54:59 <boegel> my gf complains about my libido :p
07:55:03 <shapr> boegel: haha
07:55:05 <basti_> THAT too.
07:55:06 <ibid> shapr: ("sauvakävely")
07:55:07 <shapr> ibid: I don't know?
07:55:17 <basti_> but i think thats women isnt it?
07:55:23 <boegel> probably
07:55:24 <shapr> basti_: I think so
07:55:25 <boegel> or men :p
07:55:40 <tuomov> walking with skiing sticks
07:55:44 <basti_> well one has to keep the genes running
07:55:44 <shapr> oh yeah
07:55:48 <shapr> my fiancee does that
07:55:56 <ibid> shapr: walking with sticks in a style reminiscent of cross-country skiing (no skis)
07:56:02 <ibid> tuomov: not skiing sticks
07:56:11 * boegel should start working, but a film I recorded last night is shouting 'watch me'
07:56:15 <shapr> I tried that, it's surprisingly effective. Those sticks really make a difference.
07:56:20 <ibid> yeah
07:56:32 <boegel> shapr: does what ? keep the genes running ? :D
07:56:44 <shapr> :-P
07:56:46 <basti_> ....?
07:57:08 <boegel> basti_ well one has to keep the genes running
07:57:08 <boegel> shapr oh yeah
07:57:08 <boegel> shapr my fiancee does that
07:57:11 <shapr> The sticks increase the amount of exercise you get in the same distance/time.
07:57:25 <shapr> It's actually a lot of work.
07:57:35 * esap just implemented lambda abstraction: eval (TLambda body) = proc c -> returnA -< (proc a -> eval body -< (c,a))
07:57:39 <shapr> When I was learning to unicycle I wished I had some really long walking sticks :-)
07:57:53 <shapr> esap: oooh, neat... arrows!
07:58:02 <jadrian> esap: -< ?  reactive functional programming?
07:58:03 * boegel is booting the movie, bye everyone
07:58:12 <esap> jadrian: just arrow syntactic sugar
07:58:14 <basti_> i'll get headache
07:58:17 <jadrian> oh
07:58:47 <jadrian> that's just like monads syntatic sugar but for non monadic stuff right?
07:58:50 <basti_> i always thought terse code is an advantage
07:58:58 <basti_> but haskell is well...
07:59:10 <jadrian> a -< selectSomeStuff xs
07:59:19 <jadrian> b -< someOtherStuff
07:59:21 <esap> jadrian: for the Arrow classes. Very useful for writing evaluators
07:59:23 <basti_> twisted like perl but not as simple ;)
07:59:26 <shapr> heh
07:59:47 <shapr> Haskell can have more complexity than perl in less characters.
08:00:03 <basti_> yes.
08:00:07 <shapr> For example, the most recent winning IOHCC entry.
08:00:23 <psi> i hear you talking about arrows all the time, buti can't find it in my haskell book. is it something new?
08:00:31 <basti_> theres a IOHCC?
08:00:32 <basti_> ugh
08:00:35 <shapr> how to make all Haskell programs alpha-equivalent
08:00:57 <esap> psi: see http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/arrow-notation.html
08:00:57 <shapr> basti_: sure, I did most of the organization for the last two.
08:01:01 * jadrian just uses arrows with it's -> instance to define point free functions
08:01:07 <shapr> well, disorganization is more realistic
08:01:27 <basti_> youre sick.
08:01:31 <shapr> it's actually quite fun
08:01:40 <jadrian> things like: foldM (\c->f c|||g c)
08:01:42 <shapr> basti_: http://www.scannedinavian.org/iohcc/
08:01:47 * esap also implemented function application: eval TApply = proc (a, b) -> a -<< b
08:01:48 <basti_> found it already
08:02:09 <psi> esap: thanks
08:06:43 * Heffalump looks around for people familiar with Debian packaging
08:09:14 <Heffalump> oh, never mind
08:09:38 <Calister> good afternoon 
08:09:42 <basti_> hi Calister 
08:09:48 <Calister> heya :)
08:11:50 <shapr> guten abend Calister
08:12:00 <shapr> wie geht es?
08:12:09 <Calister> gut ^_^ danke. und dir?
08:12:15 <shapr> gut
08:12:42 * shapr delays doing swedish homework
08:12:48 <basti_> sagt mal ganz schnell: im dichten fichtiendickicht nicken dicke finken tüchtig
08:12:53 <Calister> lol
08:13:14 <Calister> dats a bad one basti, i always get my tongue tied up in that one
08:13:21 <basti_> yup.
08:13:23 <basti_> my favourite
08:13:25 <basti_> by far
08:13:30 <shapr> zwitchen zwetchen zweigen... oh I forget
08:13:37 <Calister> swedish homework? oha >_<
08:13:38 <basti_> also because everyone ends up saying "ficken
08:13:43 <Calister> aye
08:13:46 <Calister> ^_^
08:13:51 <Calister> hmm
08:13:59 <Calister> i think ima teach my bf that one
08:14:01 <Calister> O:)
08:14:11 <basti_> does he say too rare?
08:14:24 <Calister> my bf aint speaking german yet ;)
08:14:42 <basti_> where's he from?
08:14:55 <Calister> shapr, do you wanna take my exam on wednesday for me? pretty purdy please >_<
08:15:09 <Calister> basti_ : michigan
08:15:18 <basti_> ic
08:15:44 <basti_> a friend of mine was supposed to do an internship or something at the u of m but they didnt reply from some point on
08:15:44 <shapr> Calister: is your wednesday exam about Swedish?
08:16:06 <shapr> Jag kan tala lite svenska.
08:16:07 <Calister> shapr: worse... haskell ^_^
08:16:14 <basti_> lol
08:16:15 <shapr> oh, that's easy.
08:16:20 <shapr> and fun!
08:16:21 <Calister> oh god, i even understood what you said!
08:16:24 <Calister> lol
08:16:26 <Calister> ;P
08:16:41 <Calister> basti_: my bf tries to find a job here
08:16:47 <jadrian> svenska = swedish?
08:16:49 <Calister> so he can move closer to me
08:16:55 <basti_> :)
08:16:56 <Calister> yep
08:17:17 <jadrian> even I will end up learning swedish just from hanging around in here
08:17:18 <basti_> need funny german music for his lessons? =)
08:17:24 <shapr> heh
08:17:27 <jadrian> ;)
08:17:29 <shapr> hiya spawnyd
08:17:40 <Calister> funny german music? like what? ;o
08:17:44 <basti_> ernst horn
08:17:46 <shapr> jadrian: Ã³la
08:17:55 <basti_> "Kamfgeist Sachverständig" for example
08:18:06 <Calister> oh god, i aint getting this one song outta my head.. im "popstars" infected.. waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah *panics*
08:18:13 <basti_> or "Frühling"
08:18:16 <jadrian> my guess would be that "Jag kan tala lite svenska" means something like, "I can talk swedish"
08:18:23 <jadrian> and I'm missing one of the words
08:18:27 <basti_> Calister: :(
08:18:28 <shapr> I can talk little swedish
08:18:29 <jadrian> did I guess it right?
08:18:31 <jadrian> damn
08:18:35 <Calister> lite
08:18:36 <jadrian> I was gonna say that
08:18:38 <jadrian> yes
08:18:40 <Calister> like in english
08:18:42 <jadrian> I was gonna say that!
08:18:43 <Calister> light
08:18:45 <jadrian> argh
08:18:45 <Calister> ^_^
08:18:50 <jadrian> but it was close enough :)
08:18:52 <shapr> kan == can, tala == talk, lite == little, svenska == swedish
08:19:03 * Calister pats on jadrian's shoulder.. next time ;)
08:19:06 <shapr> It's not so far away from English.
08:19:12 <jadrian> yeap
08:19:22 <Calister> swedish is a mix of german, english and something else
08:19:27 <shapr> Until you get into words like gnÃ¤gga and fnissa, then it's way different.
08:19:34 <jadrian> and Jag reminded me of "Je"
08:19:37 <basti_> lol
08:19:46 <Calister> glögg! or however its spelled ;x
08:19:47 <shapr> Calister: Dutch is the third ingredient, seems to me.
08:20:02 <Calister> dutch and german are very close
08:20:15 <jadrian> and I was gonna say "little", but since shapr seems to speak swedish quite well I thought that it couldn't be it :P 
08:20:21 <Calister> so you can count those as one in swedish ;)
08:20:29 <shapr> jadrian: I was trying to be humorous, as usual.
08:20:30 <basti_> gangschaltung = versnelling = transmission =)
08:20:36 <jadrian> shapr: yeap :)
08:20:38 <Calister> ^_^
08:21:05 <Calister> gagagagagaga... i aint getting "sweetest poison" outta my head anymore
08:21:08 * Calister screams
08:21:14 <basti_> auspuff = knalpot = exhaust ;)
08:21:22 <shapr> you could sing 99 luftballoons
08:21:22 <Calister> knalpot?
08:21:23 <Calister> lol
08:21:31 <shapr> I like that song.
08:21:52 <Calister> nothing helped so far to get this song outta my head :s
08:21:54 <shapr> umgÃ¥s == chat
08:22:00 * Calister is trying the hardcore way now
08:22:11 <shapr> rammstein?
08:22:14 <Calister> no
08:22:26 <shapr> not ace of bass??
08:22:26 <Calister> its one of those tv casting bands
08:22:40 <Calister> the band is called ummmm lemme check
08:22:46 <shapr> In cases of extreme emergencies, you could always try Abba.
08:23:14 <Calister> nu pagadi
08:23:16 <Calister> lol
08:23:33 <Calister> basti_, that was awesome timing.. i just hit enter for a word when that poped up
08:23:59 <basti_> mh ;)
08:24:03 <Calister> abba, oh yes, they mostly help
08:24:27 <basti_> hrhr
08:25:07 * shapr dresses up in pink and sings "Dancing Queen"
08:25:11 <Calister> lol
08:25:19 <Calister> i like pink :X
08:25:20 <basti_> hehe
08:25:25 <shapr> I look great in Pink.
08:25:32 <basti_> dancing queen is SO...
08:25:33 <Calister> ^_^
08:25:34 <Calister> me too!
08:25:35 <babybo0m> ERROR C:\tudelft\haskell\opdr4b\opdr4b.hs:13 - Last generator in do {...} must b
08:25:35 <babybo0m> e an expression     
08:25:35 <basti_> ...different.
08:25:39 <babybo0m> err sorry
08:25:50 <Calister> oh!
08:25:54 <Calister> NIN!
08:25:57 <basti_> Calister!
08:26:01 <shapr> /usr/share/prc-tools/include/PalmOS.h:12: #error No genuine PalmOS.h found
08:26:03 <basti_> NIN =)
08:26:08 <shapr> I like NiN
08:26:12 <Calister> me too
08:26:14 <Calister> closer 
08:26:15 <Calister> ^_^
08:26:16 <basti_> you all should.
08:26:19 <shapr> best song
08:26:22 <basti_> aww.
08:26:24 <basti_> overrated.
08:26:32 <Calister> did you ever hear the fraggles closer mix?
08:26:36 <shapr> um, no?
08:26:38 <basti_> no
08:26:48 <shapr> I have nearly everything Trent ever released.
08:26:58 <Calister> i used to have it but lost it a while ago
08:26:59 <Calister> :s
08:27:30 <shapr> Further down the spiral has some excellent tracks. An amazing Aphex Twin remix, and lots of other great tracks.
08:27:50 <basti_> i have that one
08:27:58 <shapr> "At the Heart of it All"
08:28:06 <Calister> basti_, this is a nice song. never heard it before
08:28:11 <shapr> That's Haskell-quality complexity.
08:28:19 <basti_> Calister: thats from "The Fragile"
08:28:43 <shapr> I like "We're In This Together Now"
08:29:01 <basti_> oh yes.
08:29:05 <shapr> Of course, "Burn" and "Perfect Drug" are contenders for the top five spots.
08:29:06 <Calister> "perfect drug"
08:29:11 <Calister> :D
08:29:14 <basti_> =)
08:29:15 * Calister nods
08:29:29 <Calister> but i also like starfuckers, inc
08:29:33 <basti_> I also like the lyrics in the newer pieces.
08:29:39 <shapr> I've seen Trent twice in concert.
08:29:46 <basti_> i havent
08:29:52 <Calister> me neither
08:29:54 <Calister> o.o
08:30:07 <Calister> concerts are dangerous o.o esp in ohio o.o
08:30:16 <basti_> not my era ;)
08:30:16 <shapr> The first time was in the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, there was a massive moshpit.
08:30:38 * shapr sighs happily
08:30:42 <shapr> I love moshing :-)
08:30:45 <basti_> i have seen ozzy.
08:30:49 <shapr> oh neat
08:30:54 <basti_> that was something
08:30:59 <basti_> such a great mood :)
08:31:10 <Riastradh> I have seen BB King.  Nyah!
08:31:13 <shapr> I saw Tori Amos. She's seriously weird.
08:31:22 <shapr> Oh, I saw BB King at City Stages in Birmingham.
08:31:27 <shapr> And Santana too
08:31:38 <shapr> Santana played for so long I wanted to take a nap!
08:31:39 <basti_> santana is great =)
08:31:43 <Riastradh> I also saw Dr John at the same concert.
08:31:47 <Calister> i have seen.. hmmm... Die Ärzte ^_^
08:32:15 <shapr> I'd like to see Jimmy Buffet.
08:32:28 <shapr> I saw Bob Dylan, that was crazy.
08:32:36 <Calister> and Black Eyed Peas n Justin Timberlake (AND THAT WASNT MY FAULT! :x i got the ticket from my cousin for my bday, cuz SHE wanted to go there.. but she didnt wanna go alone)
08:32:54 <basti_> öpö
08:32:56 <basti_> lol
08:33:01 <shapr> There was so much marijuana smoking in the audience of Bob Dylan that I lost track of the last half of the concert.
08:33:08 <Calister> aint family lovely?
08:33:13 <Calister> uh
08:33:13 <basti_> =)
08:33:26 <basti_> thats the part i'd really like then
08:33:40 <shapr> I don't like smoking marijuana, so it was really strange for me.
08:33:51 <basti_> aww.
08:34:03 <Calister> shapr, dont remind me to joints n stuff.. i never smoked this stuff, but when i saw matrix in an huge openair cinema, the dudes in front of me smoked LOTS
08:34:26 <shapr> well, at least they probably weren't upset at the lack of plot then :-)
08:34:37 <Calister> lol
08:34:40 <basti_> matrix? lack of plot? ;)
08:35:01 <basti_> who cares about lack of plot in such a fucking awesome eyecandy? ;)
08:35:05 <shapr> true
08:35:13 <Calister> the movie gets a lil weird when you are in a cloud of marijuana smoke
08:35:34 <shapr> time for food!
08:35:34 <basti_> it is weird.
08:35:44 <Calister> my poor bf hadda suffer from the movie lol
08:35:54 <musasabi> Should I even try to make udp checksumming code efficient in haskell or just write it in C?
08:35:59 <jadrian> basti_: it was much worst than lack of plot...
08:36:01 <Calister> his nick's been for ages "matrix" and then the movie came out
08:36:05 <Riastradh> C is evil.
08:36:14 <Calister> C is nice :]
08:36:24 <Riastradh> KILL KILL HATE HATE MURDER MURDER MUTILATE
08:36:36 <basti_> i didnt watch matrix for the story ;)
08:36:40 <Calister> you can nicely screw up the comp with just one wrong pointer
08:36:41 <Calister> ^_^
08:37:08 <tuomov> matrix1 was ok for the fx, but the sequels have been utter crap
08:37:24 <Calister> i liked 3 more than 2
08:37:32 <Riastradh> That doesn't say much, Calister.
08:37:35 <jadrian> basti_: the contrast between action and lameness is difficult to stand... even my sister had trouble with it...
08:37:36 <basti_> i didnt watch 2 or 3.
08:37:36 <Calister> lol
08:37:40 <jadrian> oh
08:37:41 <basti_> hehe
08:37:44 <jadrian> oh!
08:37:48 <jadrian> that explains it
08:38:00 <basti_> that was a concious decision
08:38:05 <jadrian> 3 is really difficult to watch (at least it was to me)
08:38:05 <Calister> well 1 was still best of the 3
08:38:10 <basti_> i see movies as single works not as continuation
08:38:10 <Riastradh> I saw the second one and decided not to waste any time with the third.
08:38:12 <jadrian> yeap
08:38:24 <np_hard> lots of allusions to continental philosophy in the matrix series
08:38:27 <xerox> Agreeable.
08:38:33 <musasabi> screwing up in haskell is harder to deal with.
08:38:45 <musasabi> because most of the time it is subtle lazyness effects.
08:38:48 <np_hard> also, the movies are much better when you realize that Agent Smith is the protagonist
08:38:56 <np_hard> neo and trinity are just foils
08:39:01 <Calister> basti_.. frühling is a seriously weird song o.O
08:39:07 <basti_> Calister: indeeed.
08:39:26 <np_hard> Smith is the deepest and most human character in the movies
08:39:40 <Calister> i know a guy who looks like a young neo
08:39:57 <Calister> oh shoot, brb phone!
08:40:14 <jadrian> np_hard: maybe, but neo got the most screen time, and was the one who "saved the day"...
08:40:44 <np_hard> yeah, I spent Neo's screen time thinking about Smith and what he was going to do next
08:40:46 <np_hard> :)
08:40:51 <jadrian> :)
08:41:02 <np_hard> the fight sequences were entertaining enough
08:43:14 <Calister> (still on phone..) bout disappointing sequels: star wars was worst :s i love 4-6, but the rest?
08:47:23 <babybo0m> hrmm... ok, so now i know how to apply String functions to an IO String, but is there a way so that a function "input" actually returns a String instead of IO[String] ?
08:48:08 <Heffalump> no.
08:48:52 <babybo0m> ok... so i need to use do a <- input let .... every time?
08:50:26 <Heffalump> or equivalent, yes
08:51:04 <babybo0m> ok, thanks
08:52:35 <jadrian> I think you meant IO(String) not IO[String]
08:54:15 <babybo0m> jadrian hugs tells me Type           : IO [String]
08:54:51 <jadrian> babybo0m: ok then you probably meant, "is there a way so that a function "input" actually returns a [String] <----  instead of IO[String] ?
08:55:38 <jadrian> your function returns a list of strings, not a string
08:56:22 <babybo0m> yeah, i meant that. but that eventually comes down to the same solution for me
08:56:26 <jadrian> yeap
08:56:38 <jadrian> I just meantioned in case you didn't notice it
08:58:44 <babybo0m> true, thanks :)
09:18:33 * shapr watches German Science Fiction from the 50s
09:18:39 <Calister> ;o
09:18:58 <Calister> any fun? ;p
09:19:32 <shapr> actually, it's really great
09:19:43 <shapr> "Raumpatrouille Orion"
09:19:46 <Calister> kewl beans ;o
09:19:47 <Calister> oh!
09:19:49 <Calister> ya
09:19:59 <Calister> that is awesome ^_^
09:20:03 <shapr> producer's cut 2003
09:20:09 * shapr goes back to watching
09:20:13 <Calister> have fun!
09:20:44 <Lemmih> "The Orion spacepatrol"?
09:21:05 <Calister> yep
09:21:19 <Calister> is it german?
09:21:25 * Calister scratches her head
09:21:47 * Heffalump wonders if he should follow the HaXml naming conventions for binaries (uppercase stuff) or the Debian ones, when debianizing HaXml
09:25:52 * Calister doesnt know
09:44:52 <DeeJay> a quick query - how do i make an Int to Float coercion, or more to the point, convert a Char to a Float directly, rather than using digitToInt
09:46:26 <ibid> what do you mean by converting a char to float?
09:47:30 <DeeJay> well i'm trying to write a function, that parses a string, and returns the number contained in it
09:47:55 <ibid> is this an exercise?
09:48:14 <DeeJay> a personal one, yeah, in the hope of learning
09:48:31 <ibid> i would just use read :)
09:49:06 <ibid> if i remember correctly, fromEnum would give you the unicode code unit of the char
09:49:16 <DeeJay> lol, what little haskell i knew has become rather rusty after spending some time with ML
09:49:56 <ibid> hm?
09:51:13 <DeeJay> hmm, ok i'll give that a try.. btw where is fromInt? the "Tour of the Haskell Prelude" claims its there, but other docs say otherwise
09:51:59 <ibid> what does the report say?
09:52:22 <Lemmih> DeeJay: Use 'fromIntegral' instead.
09:53:32 <DeeJay> ok cheers
09:53:42 <DeeJay> yah probably best to check the report in the future
09:54:25 <DeeJay> this book "the craft of functional programming" also uses fromInt
09:58:01 <vegai> have any new Haskell books come out lately? Beginner/Intermediate-level
09:59:02 <ibid> why?
09:59:25 <vegai> those might make good christmas presents
09:59:30 <DeeJay> ok thanks for your help ibid, i think i got it
09:59:54 <ibid> DeeJay: np :)
10:00:15 <DeeJay> yah i'm a moron... read is nice an easy to use
10:00:54 <ne1> too bad ghc is not sold for a price
10:01:47 <Lemmih> ne1: Not so. Send me $10 and I'll hand you a copy. d-:
10:02:03 <Heffalump> Graham Hutton's book?
10:02:13 <ne1> Hutton has a book?
10:02:37 <Heffalump> http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html - doesn't seem to be published yet, though.
10:03:16 <ne1> hrm, 1 2 3 4.  Why doesn't he start with 0? :D
10:04:35 <ne1> He tackles type classes early. How well this will work with students will be interesting.
10:05:13 <vegai> I think the type system is not an especially difficult part in Haskell
10:05:22 <vegai> at least basic understanding thereof
10:05:41 * vegai mumbles something.
10:07:34 <stepcut> hrm, adding next buttons in halipeto is damn trick !
10:07:40 <stepcut> tricky
10:08:31 <vegai> anyone read "The Fun of Programming"?
10:08:39 <Heffalump> vegai: yes
10:08:56 <vegai> any good? Level?
10:09:03 <ne1> Ah, the fun of programming.  Now I know what to buy for christmas.
10:09:24 <Heffalump> absolutely brilliant ;-) [I cowrote one of the chapters] Fairly advanced.
10:09:59 <ne1> I have already resolved to buy intro to lattices and order, but it alone is too cheap to qualify for free shipping.  I have been looking for an additional book.
10:10:08 <Heffalump> I think it's a good book for people who are already reasonably expert Haskell programmers. Not much point for anyone else.
10:11:37 <ne1> My favourite online bookstore doesn't carry it.
10:16:38 <ne1> my unfavourite online bookstore carries it, but it also sells the lattice book at a much higher price.
10:17:57 * Heffalump tries to build HSQL
10:50:19 <bourbaki> moin
10:50:34 <basti_> hi bourbaki 
10:50:36 <xerox> heyhey,.
10:51:26 <bourbaki> has anyone of you some site or paper on automata and haskell how to run them and such
10:52:59 <bourbaki> or maybe petri nets or similar since it would be good if i can run programs at multiple places
10:56:59 * Oejet is looking in his paper collection.
10:58:42 <Oejet> "Regular Expressions and Automata using Miranda", Simon Thompson, May 1995
10:58:55 <musasabi> Erlang has lots of automatons.
10:59:11 <bourbaki> hm the thing is that i need something that is able to branch in more then one direction
11:00:00 <bourbaki> one of my probs is that if you have two branches that would match and you want to get the product as a returned value then you would need something that makes it a product
11:00:19 <bourbaki> and even worse if you want to put the pruduct again into a function like in a neural net
11:00:21 <musasabi> that sounds like a monad..
11:00:33 <bourbaki> where you sum up alot of values
11:00:35 <musasabi> (but I don't know about neural nets)
11:01:12 <bourbaki> i want to make it graph transformations of petrinet like things
11:01:49 <bourbaki> so its a monad if you want to look at it like that the transformations are concaternatable
11:03:03 <bourbaki>  the thing is i want to collapse these graphs or automatons with the help of arrows
11:03:12 <bourbaki> i can do that by hand with a lot of thinking
11:03:32 <bourbaki> but i need to get an automated way
11:03:34 <bourbaki> ie
11:03:39 <bourbaki> you have 4 nodes
11:03:45 <bourbaki> n1 ... n4
11:04:12 <bourbaki> n1 -> n2, n1 -> n3, n4 -> n2, n4 -> n3
11:04:25 <jadrian> <Heffalump> absolutely brilliant ;-) [I cowrote one of the chapters]
11:04:28 <jadrian> Heffalump: nice!
11:04:33 <jadrian> Heffalump: which one was it?
11:04:43 <bourbaki> and all these four functions are id
11:04:47 <Heffalump> which chapter? The one with my name on it ;-)
11:04:55 <Heffalump> (about "Mechanising Fusion")
11:04:56 * jadrian doesn't have the book
11:05:07 <musasabi> so you want a more light weight abstraction.
11:05:08 <jadrian> I just read about it...
11:05:11 <Heffalump> then why does me telling you what chapter it is help? ;-)
11:05:20 <jadrian> Heffalump: I read about it some time ago
11:05:25 <bourbaki> and you want to make this small graph a single function
11:05:34 <musasabi> bourbaki: some of the AFRP papers contained things about optimizing a network of nodes.
11:05:35 <jadrian> Heffalump: I know it has hardware verification with lava, haskore(?) etc
11:05:44 <jadrian> I'm thinking about buying it
11:06:34 <bourbaki> musasabi: hm got a link handy? the thing is that if i roll up the stuff from its sink nodes then i get a problem on the input part that is they all have to have the same number of inputs
11:06:53 <Heffalump> jadrian: yeah
11:07:02 <Heffalump> I think Lava is more about hardware description than verification.
11:07:10 <jadrian> Heffalump: yes right
11:07:20 <bourbaki> and if i do it in a foward way toward the sink nodes from the source nodes then i have the problem that the sink nodes are not ordered in the right pareing due to arrows
11:08:43 <bourbaki> apart form that i think that i should be able to construct graphs now in quite a funny way :) although i cant run the graphs yet id need to add something like petri net tokens containing the data i process 
11:09:17 <bourbaki> and that way i can finaly produce self modyfing program/graphs
11:10:00 <jadrian> Heffalump: "Fusion" as fusion laws of fold and such? Combining several steps into one, etc... or am I in the wrong track?
11:10:09 <bourbaki> is graph triangulation structure preserveing?
11:10:43 * jadrian googles MAG system
11:12:50 <basti_> structure?
11:13:09 <jadrian> Ah exactly, program transformation
11:13:22 <musasabi> bourbaki: I remember printing it from net, I can look a bit.
11:15:24 <CrewdenX> :!make
11:15:24 <CrewdenX> ack =)
11:15:38 <musasabi> bourbaki: http://www.haskell.org/yale/papers/haskellworkshop02/index.html
11:15:56 <musasabi> iirc GADTs make that a little more pretty.
11:16:01 <bourbaki> thanks
11:16:58 <Cali^foodiliciou> duh
11:17:01 <Cali^foodiliciou> one is missing
11:17:12 <basti_> =)
11:17:48 * Cali^foodiliciou glues a "s" to her nick and runs off
11:20:58 <shapr> jpieper: greetings, looking for Haskell info?
11:21:34 <jpieper> shapr: Yes, in a way.
11:21:35 <Itkovian> Any suggestions on how to write this in a simpler way?
11:21:36 <Itkovian> Bin {Bin.length = 100, Bin.width = 60, Bin.offset = Offset { Offset.x = 0, Offset.y = 0 }}
11:21:49 <Itkovian> Bin is a record datatype, so is Offset
11:24:21 <Philippa> do you know the order of the fields in the ADT, and can you rely on it remaining fixed?
11:24:39 <Philippa> Bin 100 60 (Offset 0 0) might make sense then
11:25:03 <basti_> -.o
11:25:21 <Philippa> records in still-plain-ADTs shocker? :-)
11:26:22 <basti_> you know some times on this channel i think to myself "this is plainly sick. these things are not meant to think about"
11:26:28 <Itkovian> Well, I I'd ever add a field ...
11:26:48 <Itkovian> s/I/if
11:27:23 <Itkovian> right now, I think I can add a field to the definition and not change any code where it's not used, right?
11:27:28 <Philippa> right
11:27:34 <Philippa> them's the breaks
11:27:40 <Itkovian> eh?
11:27:56 <Philippa> I believe you can shorten to Bin {length = 100, width = 60, offset = Offset{x = 0, y = 0}} though
11:28:21 <Philippa> assuming you don't have conflicting fieldnames from other modules, anyway
11:28:22 <Itkovian> sure, but not if there's other 'length' definitions lying around ...
11:28:25 <Itkovian> idd
11:28:32 <Philippa> if there are, they're in other modules
11:28:35 <Philippa> by definition
11:28:48 <Itkovian> yes they are, but if two such modules are imported into a third ...
11:29:14 <Philippa> then you play with the import facilities to get the most convenient result possible
11:29:34 <Philippa> eg qualifying the Length module as L rather than Length
11:29:43 <Philippa> or just not importing length from all but one module if that's practical
11:30:13 <Itkovian> well, I have a datatype called Plate , which, incidentally, also has a length field name
11:30:52 <Philippa> then it's short qualifications time, isn't it?
11:30:58 <Itkovian> Anyway, I'd like to make sure I can, at some later point import my module into another program as well, without having conflicting names ...
11:31:11 <Philippa> exports lists are your friend
11:31:54 <Itkovian> That's an option, but it wouldn't shorten the length of code if I'd actually want to use anything, would it?
11:32:02 <Itkovian> Or am I mistaken?
11:32:07 <Philippa> it would if you're only exporting one length
11:33:13 <Itkovian> ah, but I'd need to acces it from both modules.
11:34:40 <Itkovian> I'll paste some code on the irc paste page
11:37:20 <Itkovian> pasted ...
11:37:26 <Itkovian> Any suggestions are welcome
11:42:06 <jpieper> shapr: Sorry, phone call.  I was just trying out Haskell for the first time with hugs and was slightly confused because I couldn't seem to declare new functions from the interpreter, only from within scripts.  Is there some other syntax for that?
11:42:22 <basti_> i think this is intentional
11:43:18 <jesse98>  is there any way to stringify an expression? ie the sort of thing you might do with an assert macro in C
11:45:45 <Itkovian> Got to go, any suggestions on my pasted code, you can leave at my nick on gmail. thx
11:46:11 <jesse98> or can I go the other way and eval a string?
11:47:38 <basti_> not without deeper pondering
11:48:57 <ne1> maybe there is some template haskell implementation of that?
11:51:55 <jadrian> Itkovian: if you're still there, another option is to code your own record update functions
11:52:12 <jadrian> Itkovian: if you got to use many record updates it may be worth it
11:52:59 <jadrian> Itkovian: so you get to keep your named records, and still have  short way of updating
11:53:21 <jadrian> I think those update functions can be derived with Drift but I haven't used it yet
11:59:20 <jesse98> hmm, i'm thinking that the way to write a haskell unit test framework is to rely on a code genrator which kind of sucks
12:05:49 <Philippa> jesse98: at least it's an excuse to abuse TH to cover up the suckage
12:07:00 <jesse98> does TH allow you to manipulate strings or just program fragments?
12:07:31 <Philippa> strings as in string literals, or as in strings-of-code?
12:07:47 <jesse98> strings as in literals
12:07:57 <Philippa> I'd imagine so
12:08:08 <jesse98> although converting code to strings would work as well
12:08:12 <Philippa> some variant of StrLit String as the offending constructor
13:11:10 <stepcut> hrm, I think I need a mapAccumLeft for Data.Tree.Tree...
13:11:27 * stepcut ponders
13:12:07 <jadrian> that makes two of us 
13:12:56 <jadrian> well not Data.Tree.Tree but some similar structures I have
13:13:01 <stepcut> same here..
13:14:05 <stepcut> actually, its even more complicated, I have a tree:
13:14:06 <stepcut> myTree = Node 1 [ Node 2 [], Node 3 [Node 4 []]]
13:15:34 <stepcut> and I want to make a new tree with the same structure by making each new node be the sum of itself, the previous node, and the next node...
13:16:27 <jadrian> righ, mine is similar
13:16:29 <stepcut> where prev/next are based on in-order traversal (i think that is the right one)
13:16:56 <stepcut> jadrian: why do you plan to use yours ?
13:17:13 <jadrian> I have a mutually recursive structure
13:17:29 <jadrian> multi-equations - multiterms
13:17:50 <jadrian> and I need to map that structure and at the same time gather info about the lables
13:18:04 <stepcut> heh
13:18:07 <stepcut> what is this for ?
13:18:09 <jadrian> the strcture itself is a bit complicated (it's used in martellis unification algorithm)
13:18:20 <jadrian> Martellis Unification algorithm :)
13:18:35 <jadrian> still I'm not using the structure directly
13:18:45 <jadrian> I implemented a class of mutually recursive structures
13:18:53 <jadrian> class SubData a b | a->b where
13:18:53 <jadrian>     subData    :: a->[b]
13:18:53 <jadrian>     updSubData :: a->[b]-> a
13:18:53 <jadrian>     mapSubData :: (b->b)->a->a
13:18:54 <jadrian> ...
13:19:31 <jadrian> and I'm implementing the traversals, mappings etc for generic mutually recursive data
13:20:28 <stepcut> I am just trying to generate next and back links for my webpage =)
13:20:34 <jadrian> :)
13:22:01 <stepcut> I can not figure out how to use fold and preserve the tree structure, but I think that may be because it is not possible.. But I am not positive on that yet ;)
13:23:55 <jadrian> it's possible alright ;)
13:24:54 <stepcut> hrm, fold is a catamorphism... If I knew anything about catamorphism I might be able to answer my own question :-/
13:25:16 <jadrian> foldr is
13:25:19 <jadrian> foldl isn't
13:25:41 <stepcut> ah, I am using foldr at the momment
13:25:55 * musasabi tries to ponder what a catamorphism is.
13:25:56 <jadrian> anyway I don't think the "fold" you want is a catamorphism at all, at least if I understaod what you want
13:25:58 <jadrian> that is
13:26:29 <jadrian> you want to map the tree and calculate a sum according to a certain traversal
13:26:38 <jadrian> the maping is a cata
13:26:46 <jadrian> it can be implemented as a fold on trees
13:26:47 <jadrian> but!
13:26:56 <jadrian> the sum is not a cata
13:27:38 <jadrian> that is, if I did understand what you wanted...
13:27:49 <jadrian> understand what you want*
13:28:20 <jadrian> now you can implement that in two ways
13:28:36 <jadrian> one similar to mapAccumL and another similar to mapAccumR
13:28:56 <jadrian> I think the 1st would be more efficient
13:28:57 <joao> Hello
13:29:18 <jadrian> so you'd do a mapping with an accumulating parameter
13:29:44 <jadrian> in each node instead of mapping the subnodes and constructing a new Node
13:29:58 <jadrian> you make a call to mapAccumL
13:30:37 <jadrian> let me see my code
13:31:01 <stepcut> jadrian: yeah, that sounds like the direction i was headed in
13:32:03 <Calister> christmas is evil :( *got cookie crumbles in her keyboard*
13:32:52 <jadrian> stepcut: mine is a little different, because I want to map it and return a list (which should be something like a foldr)
13:33:07 <jadrian> stepcut: so I actually have to do something like mapAccumR
13:33:42 <jadrian> it's an interesting algorithm, what I have to do is
13:33:52 <stepcut> mine is a bit tricky, because I need to not only know the value from the previous node, but also from the next node
13:34:11 <jadrian> yes...
13:35:34 <jadrian> that is tricky in deed
13:35:55 <jadrian> hmmm
13:37:38 <stepcut> so far I am just worried about doing one direction (specifically, the next node)
13:37:46 <jesse98> are there any conventions for documenting definitions, e.g. for use by doc tools
13:38:01 <stepcut> so I might do a mapAccumR variation first
13:38:08 <jadrian> I think just one direction should be easy...
13:38:19 <swiert> have you guys ever looked at the uu attribute grammar system?
13:38:30 <stepcut> swiert: no..
13:38:52 <swiert> it was specifically designed to make complex computations easy (underlying implementation generates catamorphisms for you).
13:39:10 <swiert> computations over trees - specifically.
13:39:17 <jadrian> me is going to implement his mapAccumR too
13:40:04 <jadrian> I already implemented my function directly in the structure, but now I need that pattern again and I want to abstract it
13:40:37 <jadrian> it was quite some time ago so I have to look and understand my structure again :-|
13:40:39 <jadrian> brb
13:54:02 <swiert> Anyway - I'm about to leave - probably be back tomorrow.
13:55:57 <stepcut> nice, my mapAccumRT seems to work
13:57:40 <jadrian> stepcut: by the way, you didn't call mapAccumR for the sub nodes, you used foldr instead, right?
13:57:53 <stepcut> no, I just called mapAccumR
13:58:21 <stepcut> call foldr flattened the subnode list into a single subnode
13:59:06 <jadrian> ah nevermind, it doesn't make a difference to you I think
13:59:23 <stepcut> though, I may try to do it with foldr still
14:00:35 <jadrian> it depends on what one needs...
14:00:44 <jadrian> mapAccumR may be a good option
14:00:45 <jadrian> brb
14:00:47 <stepcut> my fold function looks like this: foldT f b (Node n c) = f n (foldr (flip $ foldT f) b c)
14:01:23 <stepcut> but I could not come up with an 'id' function to pass into it
14:02:59 <stepcut> i think I should start my written a function for foldr that preserves a list ;)
14:08:01 <stepcut> I can write a function that will turn it into a list, but I have not seen a way to preserve the structure
14:08:45 <Itkovian> jadrian: thanks
14:09:15 <Itkovian> I had thought of that, but haven't really implemented anything yet ... I'll get to it tomorrow
14:09:44 <stepcut> namely -> idF n children = [Node n children]
14:10:34 <Itkovian> going to  bed, so gdnight all
14:34:05 <Janni> G'evening.
14:34:38 <Janni> #msg nickserv identify XnqBewi
14:34:44 <Pseudonym> Haha!
14:34:46 <Janni> Whoops
14:34:48 <Pseudonym> I know your password!
14:34:53 * Pseudonym impersonates Janni
14:35:11 <Philippa> could be worse
14:35:21 <Pseudonym> Yes, it could be a password you use elsewhere.
14:35:22 <Philippa> I've seen people type in their root password to the wrong window before
14:35:23 <Calister> ya
14:35:28 <Calister> ouch
14:35:36 <Calister> but nick passwords can be bad too
14:35:51 * Philippa nods
14:35:56 <Calister> esp when you are in a channel with ghost-happy ppl
14:36:00 <Janni> Well, well...
14:36:04 <Philippa> I very deliberately use a different nick password to all my other passwords
14:36:04 * Janni goes red
14:36:24 <Calister> same here
14:36:30 <Janni> Me too, I use different passwords for everything
14:36:32 <Philippa> the big deal's making sure you identify succesfully immediately, so you can change it...
14:36:33 <Calister> + different password on every network
14:36:57 <Philippa> I don't quite do that, my memory's not good enough and I'm paranoid about physical security so I'm not gonna leave it in a client config
14:37:05 <Pseudonym> I use the same password here as I use for some other things, but they're all "insecure" things.
14:37:17 * Janni hopes, everyone believes him... and closes his ssh server
14:37:26 <Calister> i never store my passwords anywhere either
14:37:33 <Philippa> right. I don't use my root passwords for /any/ online purpose
14:37:37 <Pseudonym> Right.
14:37:46 <Pseudonym> Or my Unix login passwords.
14:38:07 <Pseudonym> But, for example, my proxy auth password here at work... well, if you have physical access to this building, we have bigger problems.
14:38:15 <Pseudonym> So I reuse that in a few places.  Not here. :-)
14:38:21 <Calister> but on the other hand im pretty happy bout using different password on all servers
14:38:43 <Pseudonym> What's the worst that can happen?  Someone downloads porn while I'm provably not here?
14:38:44 <Calister> since i got hmm how to discribe it best? well.. my ex bf is an asshole
14:38:46 <Philippa> yeah. I just have a poor memory for that kinda thing - brain full of abstractions, no room for concrete detail
14:39:00 * Pseudonym is with Philippa on that one
14:39:13 <Pseudonym> Let's see, quantum field theory... check.  What I had for breakfast... nope, dunno.
14:39:21 <Calister> my ex's worse every new password i made up
14:39:31 <Philippa> heh
14:39:36 <Calister> he'd come and get ppl upset, angry and whatever in my name
14:39:42 <Calister> worth*
14:39:45 <Calister> lol
14:39:45 <Pseudonym> Fair enough.
14:39:52 <Calister> he is worse than eveything >_>
14:40:00 <Pseudonym> Thankfully, I don't have any enemies who know any of my passwords.
14:40:11 * Philippa doesn't let her b/f know her passwords, and they're munged enough that he wouldn't guess them
14:40:15 <Pseudonym> And my wife has root access on our server, so she doesn't need my passwords.
14:40:32 <Calister> my ex DIDNT know my passwords
14:40:40 <Pseudonym> How did he find them?
14:40:42 <Philippa> he guessed 'em?
14:40:53 <Calister> he got someone to hack my msn >_>
14:41:17 <Pseudonym> At least he's not smart enough to do it himself.  Small comfort, I know.
14:41:18 <Philippa> and here you have why MSN doesn't have any of my 'most secure' passwords :-)
14:41:23 <Pseudonym> Right!
14:41:27 <Calister> lol
14:41:29 <Calister> same here
14:41:35 * Pseudonym doesn't have an MSN password that he's aware of
14:41:40 <Calister> my msn account had my very first password i made up ever
14:41:58 <Pseudonym> Your first password is like your first crush.
14:42:03 <Calister> ya
14:42:08 <Pseudonym> It's sad to lose it.
14:42:13 <Calister> it kinna hurt when he broke in
14:42:17 <Pseudonym> Well, yes.
14:42:21 <Pseudonym> It's a violation.
14:42:29 <Calister> i felt like stabbing him for deleting my contact list
14:42:38 <Philippa> ouch. Yes, I wouldn't blame you
14:42:39 <Pseudonym> Admittedly not as bad as, say, assault, but it's still a violation.
14:43:00 <Calister> Pseudonym, he did worse stuff to me indeed
14:43:04 <Pseudonym> Ah.
14:43:07 <Calister> he never hit me
14:43:08 <basti_> o.o
14:43:09 <Philippa> there're one or two folks I only know over MSN these days, somebody wiping my contact list is going to have to pay for cutting me off from friends
14:43:59 <Pseudonym> Actually, speaking of authentication... does anyone know a way to change an NDS password from Linux?
14:44:18 * Pseudonym is probably asking in the wrong place
14:45:56 <Pseudonym> Did I just kill the conversation?
14:46:09 <basti_> uhm
14:46:11 <basti_> maybe
14:46:19 * Pseudonym looks around nervously
14:46:25 <Pseudonym> So, how about that Haskell, then.
14:46:29 <basti_> you should talk about exciting things.
14:46:29 <Calister> im asking a friend ;)
14:46:30 <Pseudonym> Great language!
14:46:31 <Calister> he might know
14:46:34 <Pseudonym> Ah, thanks.
14:47:17 <Calister> yw ;)
14:47:24 <Calister> its amazing
14:47:36 <Calister> this boy knows lots
14:47:51 <Pseudonym> I know very little about Novell.
14:47:54 <Calister> like REALLY lots.. and if he doesnt know he finds most stuff out
14:47:57 <Pseudonym> I should really call my brother.  He's a CNE.
14:48:13 <Calister> lol
14:48:18 <Pseudonym> He knows about things like that.
14:48:28 <Pseudonym> He doesn't know any Haskell, though.
14:48:35 <Calister> " i suppose tell him google about for the official novell linux crap"
14:48:43 <Calister> but
14:48:46 <Calister> "and that if he is into "security" crap: http://www.nmrc.org/project/pandora/index.html"
14:49:04 <Pseudonym> Well taht's the thing.
14:49:12 <Pseudonym> I did look for the official Novell Linux crap.
14:49:15 <Pseudonym> http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/netware/qna/linux.html
14:49:30 <Pseudonym> It says "go buy this product from someone else".
14:49:45 <Pseudonym> Which is not encouraging.
14:49:54 <Calister> lol
14:49:55 <Calister> ouchie
14:50:22 <Pseudonym> All I want to do is change my password.
14:50:44 <Pseudonym> Novell is going Linux-crazy.  This shouldn't be impossible.
14:50:52 <Calister> <xerophyte> well if they wanna take the hard road; im sure that program's source reveals some way of sending / changing
14:51:04 <Pseudonym> Uhm... I suppose...
14:51:09 <Calister> <xerophyte> if he dont wanna
14:51:11 <Pseudonym> :-)
14:51:15 <Calister>  <xerophyte> id recommend sf.net and google for novell crap
14:51:27 <Pseudonym> Yes.  Lots of ways to mount Novell file systems.
14:51:31 <Pseudonym> No ways to change passwords.
14:51:34 <Pseudonym> Tried it already.
14:51:41 <Pseudonym> Thank your friend from me, BTW.
14:51:47 <Pseudonym> And thanks for being a gateway. :-)
14:52:12 <Calister> yw ^_^
14:54:51 <Calister> awww
14:54:55 <Calister> he's upset he cant help
14:55:38 <Calister> novell.. *ponders* who the heck was it who was into it? *ponders more*
14:57:28 <Pseudonym> Well my brother the CNE doesn't know of a way apart from "install Caldera".
14:57:40 <Pseudonym> So I guess I'll be borrowing someone's Windoze machine.
15:04:00 <stepcut> hrm, a disturbing number of times, I finally find an answer to my question, and it turns out oleg is the author of the answer..
15:04:20 <Pseudonym> That's a good sign.
15:04:25 <Pseudonym> It means your questions are difficult.
15:04:39 <Pseudonym> Or otherwise very interesting.
15:07:02 * stepcut reads about the under-appreciated unfold
15:07:27 <stepcut> (oleg did not write that, but he did reference it in a very useful usenet post)
15:07:57 <stepcut> I have been playing with the HList stuff alot lately... makes me want epigram :)
15:13:16 <stepcut> I am going to come up with a way to combine the broken chips at the bottom of the bag into something suitable for dipping and then sell my invention on an infomercial -- I think it will be a big success
15:23:02 <Calister> lol
15:23:45 <Calister> next thing ya gotta come up with then is something to clean yer keyboards under the keys without taking it apart completely
15:32:31 <pesco> Hi, I have a quick off-topic question. Has anybody experienced that too: In a LaTeX article, I say \pagestyle{empty} right at the top, but still the first page gets a page number at the bottom. What am I doing wrong?!
15:33:56 * Calister would answer if she still could remember any LaTeX
15:34:23 <pesco> :)
15:34:49 <pesco> It's just that this keeps happening to me. I think I've worked around it once...
15:35:17 <pesco> But I forgot, because this *shouldn't* be happening, for all I feel.
15:39:07 * Darius pokes shapr.
15:40:28 <pesco> Hah, there we go. Needs an extra \thispagestyle{empty} after \maketitle. Duh.
15:40:42 <Calister> a hooray on latex ;)
15:40:48 <Calister> the prog
15:40:55 <Calister> not the stuff
15:40:56 <Calister> ermm
15:41:06 <Calister> LaTeX
15:41:08 <Calister> there we go
15:54:27 <pesco> Bwah, it's done!
15:54:47 <xerox> What's done?
15:54:51 * pesco closes all his PDF viewers and text editors.
15:54:55 <xerox> hiya np_hard!
15:55:12 <pesco> xerox: The paper I pumped out over the last two days.
15:55:20 <xerox> Nice :)
15:55:24 <pesco> My lazyness always gets me.
15:55:32 <xerox> Haskellian-joke!
15:55:39 <pesco> yah
15:55:43 <xerox> (-;
15:55:56 <Heffalump> what's the paper for?
15:56:17 <pesco> I'm holding a little lecture on Haskell for the 21C3.
15:56:38 <pesco> It's titled "Haskell - A Wild Ride". :-P
15:57:12 <Heffalump> the what?
15:57:27 <pesco> 21st. Chaos Communication Congress.
15:57:46 <xerox> Nice one! Where/when will it be?
15:57:56 <pesco> Dec. 27th-29th
15:58:01 <pesco> In Berlin.
16:10:40 <Heffalump> anyone know how to specify binary package dependencies with Parsec?
16:29:31 <Heffalump> I meant Cabal, not Parsec, and I figured out what was going on.
16:29:43 <Heffalump> and you're all dead, clearly.
16:29:57 * pesco moans faintly
16:30:54 <thebug> eep
16:30:58 <Heffalump> shh. You're dead.
16:31:06 <Pseudonym> @wiki AbstractDataType
16:31:06 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/AbstractDataType
16:31:14 <Pseudonym> I think that's wrong.
16:31:31 <Pseudonym> The page describes _algebraic_ data types.
16:33:29 <Calister> ni ni all
16:33:35 <Pseudonym> Night.
16:33:46 <np_hard> are there any other kinds of data types?
16:34:11 <Pseudonym> In Haskell... uhm... kinda.
16:34:31 <np_hard> i meant in the definition "algebraic"
16:34:56 <Pseudonym> Well, other languages do not necessarily support universal algebra directly.
16:36:44 <arjanb> ADT is a confusing abbreviation
16:37:40 <Pseudonym> Yes.
16:38:00 * Pseudonym might talk to Esa about it
16:38:07 <Pseudonym> See if I can work out what he was trying to say.
16:38:19 <Pseudonym> There's some useful stuff to be written on abstract data types.
16:38:31 <Pseudonym> Concrete views are particularly handy.
16:40:18 <Pseudonym> And using abstract data types as a micro-design tool.
16:41:45 <arjanb> @wiki AbstractDataTypes
16:41:46 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/AbstractDataTypes
16:42:10 <Pseudonym> Yes, that sort of thing.
16:42:14 <Pseudonym> But there's a lot more to be said.
16:45:26 <arjanb> and the AlgebraicDataType page is empty..
18:39:57 <jadrian> hello
18:41:28 <jadrian> nah...
18:41:40 <jadrian> Hello!!
18:42:02 * jadrian gives up
18:42:13 <Heffalump> hi.
18:42:18 <Heffalump> what are you giving up on?
18:42:20 <jadrian> Heffalump: hi :)
18:42:34 <jadrian> trying to get an answer to my "hello"...
18:42:35 <jadrian> ;)
18:42:37 <Heffalump> ah :-)

18:46:27 * jadrian is having fun generalizing list functions to other data structures
18:47:50 <jadrian> is there a word for functions like map, foldr, scanr, etc?
18:48:16 <Riastradh> Higher-order list operators?
18:48:17 <ne1> foldr is the catamorphism.  map, scanr, etc. build on it.
18:48:19 <Heffalump> well, they all happen to be catamorphisms, if that helps.
18:48:53 <ne1> I am using the words incorrectly.  Heffalump is right.
18:48:58 <jadrian> bad choice of examples...
18:49:14 <jadrian> include there foldl, scanl
18:49:22 <jadrian> I mean functions over a datatype
18:49:34 <jadrian> that are auxiliary, and just meant to be used to build other functions
18:49:54 <jadrian> and that are higher-order
18:50:21 <ne1> I think a recent moggi paper on traversal monads is relevant.
18:50:22 <jadrian> higher-order functions over a certain datatype
18:50:38 <jadrian> I would call them generic, but that has another meaning
18:50:48 * jadrian googles moggi
18:51:24 <Riastradh> Moggi is one of the biggest names in category theory.
18:51:28 <Riastradh> Even _I_ know who Moggi is.
18:52:08 <ne1> the functions you have mentioned are all natural transformations! :D
18:52:19 <jadrian> right...
18:52:38 * jadrian should re-study category theory
18:53:43 <jadrian> I'm not looking for a categorical calssification though... was just wondering if there was an informal name for higher-order functions over a certain datatype
18:54:31 <jadrian> I'm already using way to much theoretical concepts...
18:54:51 <jadrian> (paramorphims, catamorphisms, etc)
18:54:52 <ne1> "operations" :D
18:55:01 <jadrian> eh :)
19:00:23 <shammah> of course map also happens to be an anamorphism if that helps ;)
19:00:59 <Riastradh> Map is also a hylomorphism.
19:04:56 <shammah> However I was under the impression that a HOF representing structured recursion following the (constructionist?) defnition of a datatype was a paramorphism?  (attempting to answer jadrian's actual question)  But I don't really have much of a grasp of these concepts.
19:06:58 <jadrian> a paramorphism is similar to a catamorphism, but you operate the whole data with it's recursive part
19:07:37 <jadrian> (not very formal but I think it's enought to get the idea...)
19:07:52 <jadrian> but I wasn't really trying to classify the functions
19:08:20 <jadrian> I know most of what I have are paramorphisms, some catas and probably some of them are hylos too
19:08:42 <jadrian> (and I should have made some anamorphisms, but I skipped them for now)
19:09:30 <jadrian> but I'm was just trying to find a better name than,
19:09:39 <jadrian> auxiliary functions (because its to vague)
19:09:49 <jadrian> generic functions (because it has another meaning already)
19:10:39 <jadrian> auxiliary higher-order functions over my datatype, it's ok but a little big...
19:28:43 <jadrian> polli: when is a function name too big?
19:29:19 <shammah> As an upper-bound, when you can't type it without word-wrapping ;)
19:29:27 <jadrian> hehe :)
19:32:04 <stepcut> I said around 20pt
19:32:16 <stepcut> err, I'd say around 20pt :-/
19:32:25 * jadrian has 20 chars...

19:33:03 <jadrian> oh well, better get some sleep
