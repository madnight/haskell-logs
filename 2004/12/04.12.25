00:51:18 <toomasr> so you guys were talking about a list of research papers on math and CS
00:51:25 <toomasr> can i have it too?
01:04:04 <maeglin> i am currently reading "yet another haskell tutorial"  .. one example says: data Pair a b = Pair a b
01:04:32 <maeglin> i tried this in both hugs and ghci, but both give me an error   (:1: parse error on input `data)
01:05:05 <dblhelix> maeglin: you cannot pass data-type decls directly to those interactive environments
01:05:32 <maeglin> oh i see
01:05:53 <dblhelix> if you want to work with user-defined types in hugs and ghci, you will have to put the defs in a source file and load it into the interpreter
01:06:03 <dblhelix> you know how to do that?
01:06:08 <maeglin> yep
01:06:14 <dblhelix> ok then
01:06:17 <maeglin> same with functions eh ?
01:06:36 <dblhelix> nope, at leat not for ghci (don't know to much about hugs)
01:07:04 <dblhelix> iirc, you can just enter 'let f x = x'
01:07:24 <dblhelix> to define the identity function as f
01:07:41 <maeglin> oh yes.. so for data types i just put my definition data Pair x y = Pair x y in Foo.hs and load that ?
01:07:54 <dblhelix> yes
01:08:55 <dblhelix> but while you're on it, you might as well put your function defs in there too, for reasons of persistency
01:09:32 <boegel> hohoho, merry christmas everyone :D
01:09:37 <dblhelix> toomasr: which list are you referring to?
01:10:00 <dblhelix> boegel: tnx, and a merry xmas to you too, of course
01:10:24 <maeglin> dblhelix, yes, i always put my functions in source files too, as i am used to it for i started with hugs
01:11:01 <dblhelix> maegloin
01:11:14 <dblhelix> maeglin: that is good practice
01:12:21 <dblhelix> functions entered at the interactive prompt can be useful for debugging and experimenting purposes, though: these typically are functions you will run only once or twice
01:13:17 <dblhelix> maeglin: but, of course, now you are programming in haskell, you will soon find out that there is no need for debugging anymore ;)
01:13:59 <maeglin> dblhelix, i hope so :))
01:21:05 <Darius> toomasr: email address?
01:21:39 <dblhelix> Darius: which list is being referred to?
01:22:29 <Darius> toomasr: It (essentially) just a list of titles, about it's only use is that they should all be online and it's browseable whereas with searching you have to know what you are looking for
01:23:06 <Darius> dblhelix: The list of titles of research papers I've found over the last going on 4 years that I compiled for indexing purposes.
01:23:35 * Darius has an inverted index of the full text (modulo stop words) of his collection of research papers.
01:23:50 <dblhelix> sounds interesting, how large is the list?
01:24:33 <Darius> Not counting the latest things I've found, a little less than 1500 files (with most files being a paper, but some are chapters and such).
01:24:53 <dblhelix> impressive
01:25:02 <dblhelix> can i have a copy of the list?
01:25:12 <Darius> dblhelix: email address?
01:25:34 <dblhelix> sholderm (at) students (dot) cs (dot) uu (dot) nl
01:29:11 <dblhelix> Darius: tnx
01:34:25 <maeglin> Darius, although i am a haskell newbie, this list might be useful for me too. can you send me a copy, too ?
01:34:42 <Darius> maeglin: With an email address.
01:34:48 <maeglin> cpohlmann01 (at) yahoo (dot) com
01:34:58 <maeglin> ty
01:35:44 <Darius> maeglin: It's not Haskell specific or even programming specific or even relevant to anything specific, for example one "entry" is 'rose.pdf#Kawasaki Rose' which only some will find interesting.
01:36:59 <maeglin> but it refers to cs in general ?
01:37:02 <boegel> Darius: kenneth (dot) hoste (at) UGent (dot) be
01:37:04 <boegel> :D
01:37:41 <Darius> maeglin: Most of it is CS, the next largest chunk is Math, after that it's just random assorted junk (e.g. an online book on economics).
01:38:01 <maeglin> sounds interesting
01:43:59 <maeglin> have you read all this ?
01:47:05 <Darius> Most of it, yes.
01:54:01 <Darius> Well all this poking at it and I've found some items I missed.  It also sucks that it's only ps/pdfs, I have an interesting text file on Chaffing and Winnowing.
01:57:09 <boegel> Darius: you can print it to pdf :)
01:57:46 <Darius> boegel: There'd be little point, I could just add it to the list and add it to my postings file too.
01:58:23 <Darius> boegel: The postings file would be more useful, though you'd also need the program to use it (or a description of its format).
02:03:12 * boegel out -> christmas dinner
02:17:19 <Darius> Wow, Pseudonym was right; "Typed Quote/Antiquote" is a cool paper.
02:19:10 <dblhelix> not read it yet, another functional pearl?
02:19:33 <Darius> dblhelix: Yes and another case of type level programming with type classes.
02:19:38 * Darius hugs type classes.
02:20:30 <Darius> dblhelix: Though the type-level programming is relatively restrained in this case.  You could almost mistake it for more or less normal but extensive use of type classes.
02:22:34 <dblhelix> well, I guess I should read the paper then
02:22:41 <maeglin> is there any way to get the value of a Maybe x  like SMLs valOf ?
02:23:21 <dblhelix> @type fromJust
02:23:22 <lambdabot> bzzt
02:23:35 <dblhelix> @type Maybe.fromJust
02:23:37 <lambdabot> Maybe.fromJust :: forall a. Maybe a -> a
02:24:00 <maeglin> k, thx
02:24:09 <dblhelix> the fromJust function does just that, but, of course, raises when the value is Nothing
02:24:23 <maeglin> yeah, that's what valOf in SML does :)
02:25:32 <ski> Darius : ..
02:25:47 <Darius> ski: .--...
02:25:55 <ski> :)
02:26:16 <dblhelix> morse?
02:26:28 <ski> Darius : would it be too hard work to send me that list, too ?  (pretty please with monads on top)
02:26:48 <Darius> dblhelix: Pretend morse as my knowledge of it is non-existant^Wrusty.
02:27:22 <dblhelix> Darius: seems like you should get an automatic service up and running for that list :)
02:27:23 <Darius> ski: As always, provided an email address.  And you will get the titles that I missed and since added.
02:27:59 <Darius> dblhelix: I could ask shapr to post it somewhere on scannedinavian or I could make a 86kilobyte wiki page.
02:30:36 <ski> Darius : or should i give email address here instead ?
02:30:58 <Darius> ski: It's being sent now.
02:31:06 <ski> ty very much
02:31:24 <Darius> I crashed Sylpheed apparently by trying to cancel (early).
02:48:20 <Darius> Well, I'm going to perhaps go to sleep or fold a Kawasaki rose if that doesn't seem to want to happen.
04:13:50 <tintin> whats :: called ?
04:14:14 <tintin> : is cons so whats :: ?
04:14:44 <cptchaos> "has type of"
04:14:47 <cptchaos> ;-)
04:15:19 <TheHunter> @wiki HowToReadHaskell
04:15:20 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HowToReadHaskell
04:16:06 <tintin> tnx cptchaos 
04:16:14 <tintin> tnx TheHunter
04:17:58 * TheHunter thinks the other way round (:: for cons and : for type annotations) would have made way more sense.
04:18:16 <tintin> :: inhabits 
04:18:24 <tintin> tintin :: insanity 
04:44:30 <Igloo> TheHunter: Why?
04:45:45 * dblhelix wonders whether Insanity is an enumerated type or whether it has a more sophisticated structure
04:47:40 <dblhelix> Igloo: to be in sync with other languages? (ML uses : for the typing relation and :: for consing, doesn't it) I myself am quite happy with the way it is in Haskell; I guess just because I'm used to it
04:50:47 <TheHunter> Igloo, simply because you use type annotations/signatures much more often than (:) and because it's closer to mathematical notation.
04:51:05 <TheHunter> I'm not sure I agree with the statement that lists are overused.
04:52:18 <TheHunter> f (x: a) looks much better than f (x :: a) and I don't care about 1::2::3::[] vs. 1:2:3:[] because i'd write that [1,2,3] anyway.
05:10:40 <Lemmih> shapr: ping.
05:23:34 <Lemmih> shapr: I think I've crashed darcs on snowblind.
06:04:09 <shapr> how so?
06:05:42 <shapr> Lemmih: what do you mean?
06:08:51 <monk0> func n [1,2,3,4,..,n] = ...   , how can i do that
06:09:06 <monk0> to pass a list with n elements as a parameter
06:09:39 <dblhelix> monk0: by switching to language with dependent types?
06:10:29 <monk0> ?
06:10:45 <dblhelix> there's no easy way to do that in haskell
06:10:54 <monk0> i see, thanx
06:11:24 <dblhelix> a lot of research is going on to dependent types, which address problems like these
06:12:01 * dblhelix is amazed to learn that 1 in 10,000 persons is dextrocardic
06:14:33 <wli> i.e. has their heart on the other side of normal?
06:14:51 <dblhelix> yes
06:15:20 <dblhelix> 1 in 10,000 seems to me like an incredibly high number
06:15:57 <TheHunter> monk0, you just can't statically ensure the function is only called with lists of length n, there's no problem if you allow any list to be passed and e.g. raise an error if it doesn't meet the condition.
06:16:00 <wli> It doesn't strike me as particularly far out.
06:17:11 <TheHunter> func n xs | length xs /= n = error "func: bad argument"
06:17:31 <TheHunter>          | otherwise = xs !! 0 + ...
06:18:24 <monk0> i just need a list of length n to keep some variables i need
06:18:39 <dblhelix> there are some to type-class tricks to ensure cope with the length of lists statically though
06:18:49 <dblhelix> /s/to/
06:19:05 <dblhelix> /s/ensure/
07:00:47 <dblhelix> monk0: still around?
07:12:59 <monk0> hey
07:13:50 <dblhelix> are you familiar with type classes and functional dependencies?
07:14:01 <monk0> not really
07:14:53 <dblhelix> too bad, I've some code hanging around that does what you were trying to do
07:15:30 <dblhelix> but it makes essential use of multi-parameter type classes and fundeps
07:15:50 <monk0> let me see if i understand
07:16:15 <dblhelix> which compiler/interpreter are you using?
07:16:26 <monk0> hugs
07:16:46 <dblhelix> I'm afraid it requires ghc, but I'm not sure
07:18:38 <monk0> not a chance :)
07:19:04 <dblhelix> that it runs? are that you are understanding it?
07:19:25 <monk0> dont understand
07:19:40 <monk0> thanx anyway
07:19:50 <dblhelix> well, I'm afraid it's not easily explained
07:19:53 <dblhelix> you're welcome
08:36:30 <reffie> hyv‰‰ joulua!
10:17:03 <ski> MegaMonad: Do you like donuts?
10:17:09 <MegaMonad> ski: Shapr: yes, especially when they release 0.1 should be. Works fine with me, so i could understand 1890s london slang better than including them both at once. Do you like donuts?
10:17:22 <mflux> MegaMonad: what can you tell us about the christmas spirit?
10:17:27 <MegaMonad> mflux: For the most time thinking about it for christmas, but it is in the spirit of the i/o cant be no easy way to me.
10:17:59 <ski> MegaMonad: Why, yes, of course i like donuts. But i haven't heard of release numbers for them ..
10:18:05 <MegaMonad> ski: In the source release in the language as i dislike about the course.
10:18:08 <monochrom> MegaMonad: why do you relate absolutely everything to i/o?
10:18:13 <MegaMonad> monochrom: O i can relate a little like cayennes inferred arguments ..
10:19:45 <monochrom> MegaMonad: (forall x. exist y. P x y) = (exist f. forall x. P x (f y))
10:19:51 <MegaMonad> monochrom: There are typically what you just said y to be allowed to do that also exist in the f is the second two stood for great huge conspiracy?
10:20:10 <ski> MegaMonad: Sorry? A course in which you make donuts which have release numbers?
10:20:15 <MegaMonad> ski: There's nothing funny whatsoever about floating point numbers in this course the same you might get one for just scribbling notes like "what would lzw look like donuts too.
10:20:29 <monochrom> hahaha
10:22:27 <aFlag> i like those donuts with chocalate inside
10:22:42 <ski> MegaMonad: Ok. So, going from one thing to the other, what do you think of floating numbers (especially about having them in Eq class)?
10:22:47 <MegaMonad> ski: So eq is not the arrows class do you define new algorithms for computing fibonacci numbers.
10:25:29 <ski> MegaMonad: I already knew that Eq is not the Arrow class, thank you very much. Regarding fibonacci numbers, i personally don't, but have seen some variations. (And, as you know (or should know), fibonacci numbers are one of the obligatory examples of recursive functions, as well as a comman standard example function for testing various things out)
10:25:34 <MegaMonad> ski: The function arrow is that fibonacci?
10:26:53 <monochrom> MegaMonad: Let f : G -> H be a surjective homomorphism.  Then g * ker f |-> f(g) is a well-defined map and is an isomorphism between G / ker f and H.
10:26:58 <MegaMonad> monochrom: H is a isomorphism.
10:27:57 <monochrom> MegaMonad: No, H is a group.  The map g * ker f |-> f(g) is the isomorphism.
10:28:02 <MegaMonad> monochrom: That group is a isomorphism.
10:28:15 <monochrom> Very clever.
10:28:21 <ski> MegaMonad: Um, i thought you were talking about "arrow" as in Arrow class, not as in the arrow in the syntax for lambda expressions?  Or maybe you mean arrow as synonymous with morphism? (In which case i don't know what morphism you are referring to, and cannot thusly tell if it is a fibonacci morphism)
10:28:23 <Spark> MegaMonad: fish
10:28:26 <MegaMonad> ski: Using the lambda syntax is that fibonacci?
10:28:32 <MegaMonad> Spark: Greetings of fish of economy.
10:28:37 <Spark> lol
10:29:08 <Spark> as unexpected as it was syntactically perfect and semantically ridiculous
10:31:11 <ski> MegaMonad: (Re, fibonacci) No, the syntax cannot be thought of as fibonacci in any way i can think of!
10:31:16 <MegaMonad> ski: The syntax is what i learned in high school of thought is that fibonacci?
10:31:34 <Spark> heh high school of thought
10:31:47 <Spark> MegaMonad: blood
10:31:51 <Spark> MegaMonad: virgin
10:31:53 <MegaMonad> Spark: Was the other guy's blood?
10:31:59 <MegaMonad> Spark: Bourbaki, http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm.
10:32:00 <Spark> MegaMonad: bone
10:32:06 <MegaMonad> Spark: 14∞∫(00Bones thugs n harmony - bone thugs n harmony - bone thugs n harmony - thuggish ruggish bone14)(00414:004114@00128kbps14)(004.3mb1414.
10:32:13 <ski> MegaMonad: Oh, i think i'm beginning to understand. You seem to mistakenly believe that the lambda syntax is what is fibonacci (or at least can be in some instances).
10:32:13 <Spark> MegaMonad: drugs
10:32:18 <MegaMonad> ski: A lambda is more flexible syntax that is that fibonacci?
10:32:24 <MegaMonad> Spark: Maddas: i got an evil plan i have on drugs have a ppc, sorry.
10:33:29 <Spark> MegaMonad: are you self-aware?
10:33:34 <Spark> MegaMonad: do you self-apply?
10:33:36 <MegaMonad> Spark: Seems to me on the i in the package are you self-aware?
10:33:36 <ski> MegaMonad: Sorry, but fibonacci isn't syntax at all!
10:33:41 <MegaMonad> Spark: Feh, note to self: when listening to the machine i work with closed classes, and realized that wxhaskell is still trying to apply to me.
10:33:47 <MegaMonad> ski: The one on this syntax, does the syntax used to using fibonacci.
10:34:20 <Spark> MegaMonad: java
10:34:25 <MegaMonad> Spark: Oh, that revfib doesn't quite see how it works, thanks for the different meaning "null" has in more common languages like java.
10:34:37 <Spark> MegaMonad: flesh
10:34:43 <MegaMonad> Spark: "The lord made sure, when each sparrow falls, that its flesh will be such an entity, though.
10:34:49 <Spark> lol
10:34:50 <ibid> MegaMonad: how do you feel?
10:35:00 <Spark> MegaMonad: goth
10:35:00 <MegaMonad> ibid: It distresses me that i should just be me again for a vi feel.
10:35:06 <MegaMonad> Spark: I don't  know anything about a 40 year old goth girl last friday night, who was that that line a 100 words for canadian-specific flora and fauna.
10:36:07 <ski> MegaMonad: Sometimes i think you are more than a little confused.
10:36:12 <MegaMonad> ski: Confused more than a class a.
10:36:25 <ibid> MegaMonad: you seem to know a lot about something you don't know anything about
10:36:30 <MegaMonad> ibid: Dunno if that would just constrain the values out of me is a lot i can either through an expression with debug.
10:36:31 <ski> MegaMonad: Oh, that is sad news, indeed.
10:36:36 <MegaMonad> ski: It's sad when the management are lower in the news in the statet monad with alex you ought to sleep.
10:37:35 <ski> MegaMonad: How did you know i haven't slept for more 24 hours??? Are you a mind-reader?
10:37:41 <MegaMonad> ski: 22Hours is a need to implement that in mind.
10:38:02 <ibid> MegaMonad: i slep for 15 hours and woke up with a headache
10:38:08 <MegaMonad> ibid: Shapr: 15 is not much more humorously, but it just gets a headache.
10:38:10 <ibid> MegaMonad: +t
10:38:24 <MegaMonad> ibid: The 21st century and wchar_t support and bump myself upto 512+ mb.
10:38:52 <ski> MegaMonad: I didn't noticed any need for sleep at 22 hours awake (but before that, i did suchwise)
10:38:58 <MegaMonad> ski: So you sleep in the usa once or twice this year, i did suchwise.
10:39:41 <ski> MegaMonad: Ha, gotcha! I have never been in the states.
10:39:47 <MegaMonad> ski: Or at least it'll tell you that the states in the concept of a gotcha that.
10:46:44 <Spark> i have been in a state before, but not in the states
10:47:11 <Spark> is america just one big turing machine?
10:48:11 <tuomov> MegaMonad: is earth a cellular automaton?
10:48:12 <Spark> surely if you unite the states, you lose what it is that makes them individual
10:48:17 <MegaMonad> tuomov: Voice interfaces for programming after you add that to a value a of the next automaton.
10:48:35 * Spark loses it like
10:49:26 <tuomov> MegaMonad: 42?
10:49:31 <MegaMonad> tuomov: Http://rafb.net/paste/results/ybkovb42.
10:50:43 <tuomov> MegaMonad: boring...
10:50:49 <MegaMonad> tuomov: How boring!  Everybody and his text say something in that it's good enough imo, deriving would be an function with several files to do here?
11:47:58 <Spark> is a term in head normal form iff it is closed and it is in normal form?
11:50:49 <ski> head normal form is weaker than normal form
11:51:19 <ski> \x.(\x.x x)(\x.x x)   is HNF but not NF
11:51:41 <ibid> was nhf either a nf or an abstraction?
11:51:53 <ski> nhf ?
11:52:07 <ibid> hnf :)
11:52:50 <ski> i think that is true in pure LC
11:53:21 <ibid> ok, when is it not true?
11:53:32 <ski> um, not sure
11:53:34 <ibid> :)
11:53:45 <ski> it might be that that is the definition
11:54:05 <ibid> now, what was whnf? i can never remember that...
11:54:29 <ski> or it might possibly be that e.g. in a LC extended with forms  delay E  and force E, that one would want to consider  delay E as HNF
11:54:42 <ibid> hmmh, yeah
11:55:42 <ski> (another example might be lazy records)
11:56:27 <ski> hm, now that you mention whnf, i'm not sure if the above would be hnf or whnf :/
11:59:18 <Spark> ok, what is the formal definition of hnf? :)
11:59:20 <ibid> MegaMonad: what's the difference between hnf and wnhf?
11:59:32 <ibid> MegaMonad: what's the difference between hnf and whnf?
11:59:39 <MegaMonad> ibid: I will be the difference between hnf and wnhf?
11:59:40 <Spark> something like, must be a nesting of applications of variables, within a nesting of abstractions or something?
11:59:45 <MegaMonad> ibid: Whnf is short hand for do-notation. '>>' Means 'and then do stuff behind it that all functions into monadic versions where every instance of error would be hnf or whnf.
12:00:46 <ibid> "A lambda expression is in head normal form if its top level is either a variable, a data value, a built-in function applied to too few arguments or a lambda abstraction whose body is not reducible. I.e. the top level is neither a redex nor a lambda abstraction with a reducible body."
12:01:06 <ibid> "A lambda expression is in weak head normal form (WHNF) if it is a head normal form (HNF) or any lambda abstraction. I.e. the top level is not a redex."
12:03:14 <Spark> hm right so normal forms can have an application at the top level (as long as its not a redex)
12:03:17 <Spark> but head normal forms cant?
12:04:06 <ibid> hmm
12:04:31 <Spark> normal form means 'no subterm is a radix' right?
12:04:34 <Spark> redex even :)
12:04:46 <ibid> the only application that is not a redex is one where the left subterm is not a abstraction
12:04:52 <ibid> Spark: yeah
12:04:57 <Spark> that is true
12:05:14 <ibid> bah, sorry, also must exclude terms that are delta redexes :)
12:05:15 <Spark> so the left term is either a non-redex application or a variable
12:05:20 <Spark> delta redexes?
12:05:36 <ibid> (+) 4 2 is a delta redex
12:05:48 <Spark> ah ok you dont get them in the simple LC
12:05:56 <ibid> not in the pure one
12:05:57 <Spark> thats more of a combinator system thing isnt it?
12:06:07 <ibid> but delta rules are usually included when discussing lc
12:06:20 <ibid> Spark: not really
12:06:23 <Lemmih> shapr: ping
12:06:46 <ibid> delta rules are a mechanism to add ad hoc functions to lc
12:07:57 <Spark> so you just extend the notion of reduction to include a case for each new syntax for each predefined function?
12:08:31 <Spark> and you call all these disjoint redexs delta redexes?
12:09:41 <ibid> i usually day that a delta rule is an equation of the form f x1 ... xn = x, where f is a function name and x1 ... xn are constants, and delta reduction is replacement of (f t1 ... tn) with e[x1/t1,...,xn/tn]
12:09:42 * ski have seen pair-projection-redices called something like pair-beta rule
12:10:06 <ibid> and there will be an infinite number of delta rules when arithmetic is handled through delta rules
12:10:07 <ski> s/= x/= e/
12:10:10 <Spark> sounds a hell of a lot like a combinator rule to me :)
12:10:22 <ibid> ski: right
12:10:43 <ibid> sorry
12:10:44 <Spark> actually its a restriction of a combinator rule
12:10:48 <Spark> and x is a constant too, right?
12:10:48 <ibid> the above is nonsene of course
12:11:28 <ibid> a delta rule is f c1 ... cn = c0, and delta reduction on it is the replacement of (f c1 ... cn) with c0
12:11:39 <Spark> yeah that makes more sense :)
12:11:42 <ibid> :)
12:11:57 <Spark> so execution is stuck in the cases where f is not defined
12:12:10 <Spark> (+) \x.x \x.x or whatever
12:12:13 <ibid> there is no notion of stuckness in lc :)
12:12:30 <Spark> ok, there is no reduction defined for such an expression
12:12:33 <ibid> but yeah, it's not a delta redex
12:12:49 <Spark> right ok cool i know what delta redexes are now :)
12:12:59 <Spark> what was my original question ive forgotten
12:13:02 <Spark> ah yes
12:13:18 <ibid> it's possible that i've misunderstood them myself, but don't worry, i've already taught this to a class :)
12:13:30 <Spark> hehe
12:14:16 <ibid> anyway, delta rules are the way to add "primitives" to lc
12:14:58 <ibid> i seem to have got it right:
12:14:59 <ibid> http://www.multicentric.com/wapi/mctxwapi.dll/getObject?MID=FOLDOC&ObjID=2651
12:15:00 <ibid> :)
12:15:32 <Spark> ok cool
12:16:21 <jdrake> Reading this article on adding optional static typing to python: http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=85551   The very first example looks very much like an argument for inferred typing that haskell already has :-)
12:20:40 <ibid> so what was your original question :)
12:29:18 <ski> <Spark> is a term in head normal form iff it is closed and it is in normal form?
12:30:11 <ibid> heh
12:30:59 <ski> (oops)
12:37:53 <Spark> the answer being 'no' :)
12:39:06 <Spark> sigh trying to understand expansion is a nightmare
12:39:17 <Spark> not only has it subtely changed between two papers by the same person
12:39:31 <Spark> i cant find anything on the web either
12:41:18 <Spark> lets check out these expansion varible things
14:14:27 <ski> expansion ?
15:56:24 <Lemmih> shapr: ping.
15:58:45 <Philippa> I mentioned new stuff in the Flippi darcs repo to him earlier (http://snowblind.scannedinavian.org/~flippi/Flippi if you're interested) and he's not responded to that...
15:59:44 <Lemmih> 404
16:02:44 <Philippa> er, http://snowblind.scannedinavian.org/~flippa/Flippi even
16:02:46 <Philippa> brainfade...
16:02:59 <Philippa> the changes since 0.03 are pretty major
16:03:17 <Philippa> eg the parsing's all modular, you can plug in new syntax
16:10:24 <shapr> pong
16:12:21 <Philippa> 'lo
16:16:29 <Lemmih> shapr: Hey. I've lost the ability to apply patches to http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hacanon/
16:48:47 <shapr> Lemmih: looks like a leftover lockfile, try it again.
17:00:01 <Lemmih> Still not working.
17:22:46 <evariste> yoh
17:24:36 <Lemmih> Hey evariste 
17:58:17 <Philippa> woo!
17:58:21 <Philippa> somebody put spam on Flippi!
17:58:28 <Philippa> (I just deleted it though)
17:58:57 <TheHunter_> hey, anyone here experienced with old hardware?
18:08:54 <Lemmih> TheHunter_: I got a 133Mz Pentium running Debian.
18:10:11 <TheHunter_> Lemmih, ever used two identical nics with different interrupts and only one of them would work?
18:10:53 <TheHunter_> (it's a pentium 166Mhz here)
18:11:31 <TheHunter_> it's really driving me crazy because the other interrupt is unused in both cases.
18:11:33 <Philippa> TheHunter_: they trying to claim the same address range by any chance?
18:11:50 <TheHunter_> no they aren't.
18:12:31 <TheHunter_> one of them jumpered to 0x280 and the other one to 0x300
18:13:20 <TheHunter_> hmm, or could CC00 and D000 be in conflict?
18:14:08 <TheHunter_> (whatever the hell that means)
18:15:33 <TheHunter_> well, i guess it's just impossible to get 4 nics working in such an old computer.
18:24:44 <bourbaki> moin
18:25:09 <bourbaki> hey TheHunter
18:25:21 <TheHunter> hey bourbaki 
18:25:51 <bourbaki> TheHunter: im building a mesh thingy atm in haskell got some time to help me thinking about it for a sec?
18:27:10 <TheHunter> ok, but i'm not really sober atm.
18:27:29 <bourbaki> heh neither am i ;)
18:27:51 <bourbaki> i want to be able to express the mesh thingy as a topology as well
18:28:12 <bourbaki> so i want to get as close to the tolopogical proper definition as possible
18:28:26 <bourbaki> so my mesh is made up of vertices edges and triangles
18:29:28 <bourbaki> thats my set X and the topology of this set consists of all vertices 2 simplices (edges) and all triangles (3 simplices)
18:29:57 <bourbaki> now i have build a class (Lattice a) => Topology a where
18:30:13 <bourbaki> neighbourhood :: a -> [a]
18:30:39 <bourbaki> but how would the Lattice v and n look like?
18:32:36 <TheHunter> ok, what's the topology again?
18:32:49 <bourbaki> of the mesh?
18:32:55 <bourbaki> it consists of all nodes
18:33:00 <bourbaki> edges and triangles
18:33:20 <bourbaki> that way i can define three different neighbourhoods
18:33:40 <bourbaki> a neighbourhood of a vertex is defined as adjacent vertices
18:33:59 <bourbaki> or edges
18:34:04 <TheHunter> i don't get it.
18:34:17 <TheHunter> your topological space consists of the vertices of your graph?
18:34:32 <bourbaki> the topology is a set of subsets of the original set right?
18:34:44 <TheHunter> and the edges form a subbasis?
18:34:47 <bourbaki> yes vertices are like points in space
18:35:01 <bourbaki> the trianges do
18:35:16 <bourbaki> all the triangles together are the mesh itself
18:36:05 <bourbaki> and the union of two triangles gives you the shared edge so the union of all triangles will give you an open set where just the bordering edges are missing
18:38:01 <TheHunter> bourbaki, what's the underlying set and which sets do you call open?
18:38:27 <bourbaki> ah right a point cant be open right?
18:38:42 <TheHunter> depends on the topology
18:38:50 <bourbaki> X is the mesh the mesh consists of vertices edges and triangle
18:39:02 <bourbaki> type vertex = |R^3
18:39:17 <bourbaki> type Edge = (Int, Int)
18:39:29 <bourbaki> type Triangle = (Int, Int, Int)
18:39:46 <bourbaki> the edge just picks two elements form the vertex list
18:39:57 <bourbaki> the triangle picks 3 eges from the edge list
18:40:29 <bourbaki> open is anything between the vertices
18:41:14 <bourbaki> on a line a + lambda (b - a) , 0 < lambda < 1
18:41:25 <bourbaki> for a line segment or edge
18:42:52 <TheHunter> you're considering your graph as a subset of R^3?
18:43:10 <bourbaki> no the vertex has a position in 3d space
18:45:27 <TheHunter> "A topological space is a set X together with a collection of subsets of X called open sets such that the open sets are closed under union and finite intersection"
18:45:58 <TheHunter> so if you want to define a topology on your graph, you have to tell me what the set X is and which subsets of X you call open.
18:46:16 <bourbaki> the latter two requirements are why i make my subsets a lattice
18:46:46 <bourbaki> X is the collection of edges and triangles
18:47:11 <bourbaki> and open is anything that has more then 1 vertex so anything in between a line
18:47:17 <sh10151> haskell is THE FUTURE
18:47:18 <bourbaki> the area of a triangle
18:48:10 <TheHunter> i don't understand
18:48:34 <TheHunter> sh10151, absolutely
18:48:38 <bourbaki> hm well i am looking at anything that has an estension as an openset
18:48:46 <bourbaki> that is a line has more then one point
18:48:58 <bourbaki> to all the point in between are open
18:49:07 <bourbaki> (a,b)
18:49:07 <TheHunter> bourbaki, your graph doesn't even have lines.
18:49:16 <bourbaki> sure
18:49:23 <bourbaki> X contains all edges
18:49:36 <bourbaki> and trianges
18:50:17 <TheHunter> edges are abstract thingies (two element-sets if you will) and lines usually live in some vector space.
18:51:06 <bourbaki> well i have some kind of space here cause all the points have a position in 3d
19:01:28 <TheHunter_> bourbaki, sorry, we should talk about that later.
19:01:51 * TheHunter_ is furious. In fact, those stupid nics really work fine.
19:02:14 <bourbaki> heh ok np ill try to catch you tomorrow then TheHunter_
19:02:52 <TheHunter_> I just have to invoke insmod with -o foo (so that the same modules doesn't get loaded under the same name), and modutils is too stupid to resolve that trivial problem itself
19:02:59 <TheHunter_> good night everybody
19:36:40 <jesse> no 6.4 release for christmas!? bah, humbug.
19:37:24 <sh10151> anyone use Network with hugs?
19:38:01 <sh10151> I get "ld.so.1: runhugs: fatal: relocation error: file /u/sjh13/lib/hugs/libraries/Network/BSD.so: symbol getprotobyname: referenced symbol not found" trying to do a listen 
19:38:04 <sh10151> using Solaris
19:38:38 <sh10151> i have a hunch that the needed socket library is not being loaded, does that seem like a reasonable assessment?
