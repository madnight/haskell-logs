00:04:42 <Janni> G'morning
00:04:52 <Gahhh> good night
00:04:59 <arauko> good morning.
00:05:43 <musasabi> morning
00:11:04 <desrt> good night
00:12:29 <Gahhh> One day we all will be living underground, and use UTC as the only time reference... (ugly references to the Matrix, blah blah)
01:18:47 <tintin> whats the gui option available for haskell ?
01:20:14 <musasabi> tintin: wx, gtk2, gtk, fltk, tk, ...
01:22:00 <musasabi> http://haskell.org/hawiki/LibrariesAndTools#head-75ebc687f6257857cd417c34b00fa35ec1f0c809
01:27:55 <tintin> tnx musasabi 
01:49:14 <TheHunter> oh, even ghc -O can bite you in the ass with common subexpression elimination.
01:49:25 <TheHunter> main = do
01:49:26 <TheHunter>   print $ foldl' (+) 0 [0..len]
01:49:26 <TheHunter>   print $ foldl' (const (+1)) 0 [0..len]
03:01:30 <bourbaki> moin
03:16:45 <annaguy> hello all
03:17:24 <srid> i am still wondering about a possible haskell book to choose
03:17:24 <bourbaki> hello single
03:17:35 <srid> :)
03:32:49 <wolfman8k> anyone here know russian?
03:55:07 <bourbaki> Lemmih: you there?
03:57:45 <bourbaki> anyone in here familiar with HOpenGL? and would like to help me writeing a game?
03:58:21 * arauko guesses HOpenGL means "Haskell OpenGL"
03:58:41 <Igloo> What sort of game?
03:59:07 <kristnjov> something like half-life'
03:59:41 <bourbaki> heh no
03:59:54 <arauko> yeah, something original better
03:59:59 <bourbaki> the game first would consit of a sandbox
04:00:08 <bourbaki> that is to test the game mechanits
04:00:14 <bourbaki> i want to have surfaces with balls on it
04:00:24 <bourbaki> so you can have a raceing game
04:00:27 <arauko> bourbaki, i could help you but playing with it :-P
04:00:30 <bourbaki> or a minigolf game
04:00:35 <bourbaki> heh
04:01:19 * Igloo has the very beginning of a snooker/pool game somewhere
04:01:21 <bourbaki> maybe something like rock and roll this old amiga game
04:01:58 <bourbaki> Igloo: maybe we can combine our code then id need the physics stuff of your snooker for my game
04:02:06 <bourbaki> collision response etc
04:02:22 <Igloo> No no no, very beginnings  :-)
04:02:33 <Igloo> I think it draws the balls and that's it
04:02:55 <Igloo> Along with some notes on how the physics should work for when I geta tuit to implemeent them
04:04:26 <Igloo> Are you planning to raytrace this game?
04:04:28 <bourbaki> well i have some simple papers for that
04:04:49 <bourbaki> well the rendering is totally up to the one who implements it :)
04:05:00 <bourbaki> id like to be able to have different renderers though
04:05:06 <Igloo> Oh, I think I'm confusing you with boegel, actually
04:06:12 <bourbaki> heh yes
04:06:18 <bourbaki> many do that i wonder why
04:16:01 <bourbaki> Igloo: do you write your snooker in haskell?
04:18:12 <wli> I just want something gnuplot-like but updated in realtime
04:18:19 <wli> wrt. hopengl that is
04:18:26 <wli> and that's a library call
04:18:59 <bourbaki> hm have a look at this id like to see something like that written in haskell
04:19:12 <bourbaki> http://www.perwass.de/CLU/CLUCalcDoc/index.html
04:20:44 <Igloo> bourbaki: Yes
04:21:10 <bourbaki> Igloo: would you mind to wrap the hgl renderer then so i can use it as well?
04:21:37 <bourbaki> and define some functions to rendern and such?
04:21:46 <bourbaki> a render class
04:22:30 * Igloo can't play with it ATM. If you're still interested in the new year prod me to find it
04:22:41 <bourbaki> sure
04:22:48 <bourbaki> ill do the rest of the game then
04:23:06 <bourbaki> cause its not that much work i think beside the math :)
04:29:20 <bourbaki> cant i import with relative paths?
04:30:19 <bourbaki> is * + / and such a class?
04:59:49 * Itkovian is form today on the proud father of a son, called Elias :-)
05:00:04 <wli> Itkovian: congratulations!
05:02:41 <wli> hmm, I'm not aware of usb_reset_port
05:02:46 <Itkovian> thx!
05:02:47 <wli> woops
05:02:53 <Itkovian> hehe
05:02:55 <Itkovian> wrong channel?
05:03:01 <wli> yeah
05:04:30 <srid> what is the best way to learn haskell, being a newbie FP programmer .. i got confused.
05:04:37 <wli> practice
05:04:39 <wli> hard work
05:04:42 <wli> rote drill
05:05:40 <srid> where to start actually?
05:14:21 <srid> i want to learn the theory of FP, lambda calculus, type theory .. where to go?
05:14:40 <Lemmih> college?
05:15:28 <bourbaki> heh
05:15:34 <bourbaki> mine does not teach that :(
05:15:39 <srid> here too
05:16:07 <srid> no course, except there is a course on programming languages in general .. in which students managed to skip FP by submitting assignment on it
05:16:12 <srid> .. by copying from internet
05:16:20 <thebug> yeah, our program has only one mention of FP so far, and I'm a senior ... it's only a passing mention in even our formal language classes
05:17:15 <bourbaki> i think it was cool to link the course sites with the scripts of your unis to the haskell page
05:17:54 <musasabi> STM seems still nasty.. I created a benchmark but the old purely functional data structure behind an mvar seemed to perform much better than it...
05:18:06 <bourbaki> and build blocks of scripts for each of these courses so you got different scrips of the same topic form different unis
05:19:19 <kpk> srid: this is where I started learning FP: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html
05:27:35 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/stm-bench.tar.gz - if someone wants to look at it (a mutating tree benchmark between TVars and MVar+Data.Set)
05:46:29 <vincenz> shapr: ping
05:52:36 <shapr> ?
05:53:46 <vincenz> hi
05:53:51 <shapr> y0
06:08:12 <CosmicRay> good morning
06:08:42 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: hi
06:08:47 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Dist/build/moduleb/{c.{hs,hi,o.
06:08:52 <CosmicRay> heh
06:08:58 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: that's an appropriate greeting.
06:09:04 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Multiples num max=  [num,num+num..max], what kind of greeting.
06:09:34 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: I couldn't have said it better myself.
06:09:39 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: I will note, however, that you couldn't do it yourself.
06:09:41 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: do you have any holiday plans?
06:09:46 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: But it just me and i have no plans of a why to write a function mapping type a proper holiday for almost everything?
06:09:49 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: whoa, that's mean!
06:09:54 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Whoa i made up to isomorphism yes i'm pretty sure i've got an awesome movie.
06:24:06 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: do you have a big studio contract then?
06:24:12 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: And if i has a contract to do it in the studio.
06:27:14 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: it's odd that you're the only, uhm, person, out of 100 that is responding
06:27:19 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Wagle: uhm do you order the masks in such cases the order of 100 that is responding.
06:27:47 <thebug> MegaMonad: Spaceballs the flamethrower
06:27:53 <MegaMonad> thebug: In adition to spaceballs and blazing saddles were the issues?
06:27:58 <CosmicRay> wow
06:28:17 <CosmicRay> thebug: that was a good movie
06:28:24 <thebug> hehe yep
06:29:38 <thebug> just thought I'd see what insights MegaMonad had into it ;)
06:29:51 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: Mr. Coffee or Mr. Radar?
06:29:56 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Coffee on the number under the radar.
06:29:57 <ibid> she's gone from suck to blow?
06:30:06 <ibid> hmm
06:30:09 <ibid> MegaMonad: she's gone from suck to blow?
06:30:18 <MegaMonad> ibid: Furthermore, i'll contest that if you blow out the occasional esoteric (from the guy wrote. I just love higher order things cause that would suck to blow.
06:30:27 <ibid> wow
06:30:29 <CosmicRay> haha
06:30:44 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: Ludicrous Speed!!!
06:30:47 <ibid> hmm, i'll wager a guess.  markov chains?
06:30:50 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Do you know about any distro is fine as it was the speed of his ideas don't always want to get rid of where clauses help speed?
06:30:51 <thebug> MegaMonad: I always drink coffee when I watch radar! everybody knows that!
06:30:53 <CosmicRay> ibid: yup
06:30:59 <CosmicRay> ibid: MegaHal underneath
06:31:02 <MegaMonad> thebug: That hindley and milner have come from you is the coffee would be to do all of its environment rather than a blip on rahul's radar.
06:31:06 <ibid> CosmicRay: run by you?
06:31:09 <CosmicRay> ibid: yes
06:31:15 <ibid> nice
06:31:17 <CosmicRay> ibid: trained by IRC logs of this channel
06:31:19 <thebug> good stuff, CosmicRay :)
06:31:20 <CosmicRay> @wiki MegaMonad
06:31:21 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MegaMonad
06:31:22 <ibid> CosmicRay: ohh
06:31:32 <CosmicRay> there is more info and some classic quotes on that page
06:31:38 <CosmicRay> thebug: thanks :-)
06:31:44 <ibid> i see i have been lax in following this channel :)
06:32:02 <thebug> do you happen to have source for us to peruse ?
06:32:14 <CosmicRay> thebug: megahal.alioth.debian.org
06:32:20 <thebug> ah ... thank you CosmicRay
06:32:49 <ibid> CosmicRay: it talks only when talked to?
06:32:53 <CosmicRay> My favorite MegaMonad quote still has to be: "To me java is a monomorphic type"
06:32:54 <ibid> CosmicRay: but learns from all traffic?
06:33:00 <CosmicRay> ibid: correct on both counts
06:33:16 <CosmicRay> ibid: with the exception that it ignores everything lambdabot says
06:33:21 <CosmicRay> just to avoid a botloop
06:33:24 <ibid> fiksua
06:33:35 <thebug> oh man, those classic quotes from megahal are going to make me laugh all day
06:33:45 <CosmicRay> hehe
06:33:48 <ibid> (MegaHAL: (Lots of monad if you throw me a noob.)
06:34:31 <CosmicRay> "if you want ml you know type info, but also sort of weenie." :-)
06:34:33 <ibid> MegaMonad: are you proficient in arrows?
06:34:54 <MegaMonad> ibid: (Me is not very proficient with clean here? How would the government might want to move import statements anywhere in the arrows i build a real ffi to import the lhs2tex.
06:35:19 <ibid> those stray parens don't look very good
06:35:24 <CosmicRay> yeah
06:35:28 <ibid> seems like a bug in the lexer
06:35:47 <CosmicRay> "To me java is a confusing network of stream data, write out the weenies."
06:36:40 <ibid> it'd be fun if MegaMonad would also say something occasionally without prompting
06:36:53 <CosmicRay> ibid: true.  I should work on that.
06:37:37 <CosmicRay> thebug: there are some great quotes on the megahal page, especially the "how many roads" poem.  (on the quotes, not poetry, page)
06:37:44 <CosmicRay> thebug: also check out the wiki page for megamonad
06:37:52 <ibid> "Ah. C# is not that safe."
06:37:58 <CosmicRay> <grin.
06:38:03 <kristnjov> D# is safe though
06:38:09 <kristnjov> D#m as well
06:38:21 <ibid> what about Cmaj?
06:38:34 <ibid> it's soothing to me
06:38:36 <kristnjov> Cmaj sucks
06:39:00 <ibid> MegaMonad: what do you think of Cmaj?
06:39:06 <MegaMonad> ibid: Or addtoset each one to find a read problem to be quite a bit more than me and i to think of cmaj?
06:39:42 <CosmicRay> User:    do you like tom lord?
06:39:43 <CosmicRay> MegaHAL: Tom lord is my personal dns name and wanted to see me code.
06:39:52 <ibid> "... kerry has to get a vote for kerry"
06:40:19 <ibid> "beginning perl is possible, but untested."
06:40:26 <CosmicRay> <grin>
06:40:44 <ibid> User:    does shapr boing?
06:40:45 <ibid> MegaHAL: Boing is the way to only one file.
06:41:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: dig star trek?
06:41:35 <MegaMonad> ibid: You're self-employed, so that c caused more leaks than it ought to dig out the best trek ever.. At least there was an issue with unsafeperformio is the star at the definition of >>= .
06:42:07 <ibid> MegaMonad: weird
06:42:12 <MegaMonad> ibid: That's weird i must say.
06:42:53 <ibid> "Scientists love failure; engineers love it in channel"
06:43:02 <ibid> MegaMonad: say hello to ski, would you?
06:43:08 <MegaMonad> ibid: Ski have to fail when attempting to learn about the automated way of getting me to look at the time, and the "no jump to the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic.
06:43:53 <ski> MegaMonad : hello
06:44:04 <CosmicRay> ibid: that was a good one...  this one too: "phd student" means you are talking at the moment.
06:44:10 <CosmicRay> hello ski
06:44:21 <ibid> MegaMonad: you're keeping poor company, MegaMonad, hanging out with lambdabot :)
06:44:22 <ski> hiya CosmicRay
06:44:27 <MegaMonad> ibid: Not lambdabot, but i can't open them because for the company was a name for a poor way to recursively compute graphs.
06:44:43 * ski lols
06:46:25 <ibid> MegaMonad: so, what's a good way, then?
06:46:30 <MegaMonad> ibid: Hm. Looks like we can get there and it takes a stdgen every time i didn't realise quicker what was wrong?
06:47:47 <ski> MegaMonad : how would using random numbers help ?
06:48:33 <ski> hm
06:48:36 <ski> MegaMonad: how would using random numbers help ?
06:48:44 <MegaMonad> ski: Think you'll have to wrap numbers up in colour for me, with the help like the numbers.
06:49:28 <ibid> "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), previously known as hemacs?"
06:49:49 <ski> hemacs ?
06:49:57 <ibid> no idea
06:50:07 <ibid> that's from MegaMonad's wiki page
06:50:09 <Maddas> Hebrew-enabled Emacs?
06:50:17 <ibid> haskell-emacs?
06:50:21 <ski> haskellized emacs ?
06:50:43 <tuomov> yi, previously known as hemcs
06:50:52 <CosmicRay> somebody is writing an emacs in haskell, afaik
06:50:58 <wolfman8k> hi everyone... i've put some information about a haskell program i made on my website: http://benny.kramekweb.com/hrayt/
07:00:14 <wolfman8k> any comments? :)
07:00:29 <ski> nice pics
07:00:34 <ski> :)
07:00:37 <wolfman8k> thanks =]
07:00:53 <ibid> MegaMonad: what do you think?
07:00:59 <MegaMonad> ibid: Philippa_: i *think* read may just be me not to believe that every is using /me.
07:01:11 <ibid> huh
07:04:46 <thebug> CosmicRay: which wrapper are you using to run megahal on irc?
07:05:01 <CosmicRay> thebug: there's a hal.pl in the debian package written by joey hess
07:05:18 <thebug> ah, gotcha
07:07:22 <wli> interesting
07:07:29 <wli> ghci boots on 32-bit sparc
07:08:26 <wli> heh, I called it "booting"
07:08:31 <wli> "runs successfully"
07:10:51 <bourbaki> is there a map which maps one value with a list of functions?
07:11:21 <ibid> what does that mean?
07:11:22 <musasabi> Tuo sarjis oli jotenkin kovin tutun oloinen.
07:11:27 <bourbaki> i have a list of functions
07:11:30 <musasabi> sorry. wrong window.
07:11:47 <bourbaki> and i want to apply one value to them all get the same input
07:11:48 <ibid> MegaMonad: ei se mit‰‰n ;)
07:11:52 <bourbaki> and then i want to add them
07:11:58 <MegaMonad> ibid: Man, #haskell.se is the usual neural network code in the haskell wiki has useful code or spend my college has even a have an n of a mit-x11/bsd kind of behavior will yi have?
07:11:59 <ibid> ‰hh
07:12:02 <ibid> musasabi: ei se mit‰‰n ;)
07:12:27 <ibid> "#haskell.se is the usual neural network code"?
07:15:05 <ski> bourbaki : like this ?
07:15:06 <ski> Prelude> map ($ 5) [(+ 2),(* 2),(^ 2)]
07:15:06 <ski> [7,10,25] :: [Integer]
07:15:27 <bourbaki> yes
07:15:50 <bourbaki> ok so its
07:16:01 <bourbaki> \x -> map x functionlist
07:16:02 <ski> don't think there's a standard one
07:16:06 <ski> no
07:16:13 <bourbaki> ?
07:16:17 <bourbaki> whys that?
07:16:28 <ski> "\x -> map ($ x) functionlist" in that case
07:16:47 <bourbaki> whats the $ good for?
07:16:51 <earthy> apply
07:17:03 <bourbaki> which does?
07:17:13 <earthy> f $ x = f x
07:17:26 <ski> map ($ 5) [(+ 2),(* 2),(^ 2)] = [(+ 2) $ 5,(* 2) $ 5,(^ 2) $ 5] = [5 + 2,5 * 2,5 ^ 2] = [7,10,25]
07:19:12 <ski> compare with   map (* 2) [1,2,3] = [(* 2) 1,(* 2) 2,(* 2) 3] = [1 * 2,2 * 2,3 * 2] = [2,4,6]
07:19:48 <ski> bourbaki : all clear ?
07:19:54 <bourbaki> yep i think so :)
07:20:01 <bourbaki> lets see what the compiler says
07:21:12 <ski> (maybe i should have shown the intermediate step [($ 5) (+ 2),($ 5) (* 2),($ 5) (^ 2)] in the 1st example, too)
08:28:25 <ski> OT : http://kwiki.ffii.org/Cons041221En
08:28:35 * CosmicRay sits down to write an FTP server infrastructure in Haskell.
09:46:32 <magnus--> CosmicRay: There is an ftp server implemented in SML if you are interested
09:47:04 <CosmicRay> magnus--: thanks for the offer, but it's different enough that it's just as easy to use the RFC as a reference
09:47:28 <magnus--> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/tom7misc/net/mlftpd/
09:47:35 <ibid> CosmicRay: why ftp?
09:47:47 <CosmicRay> ibid: one of many things that needs to be done...
09:48:02 <CosmicRay> ibid: plus, combined with my virtual filesystem layer, it will let people serve up arbitrary objects over ftp
09:48:10 <CosmicRay> ibid: not just the system's filesystem
09:49:03 <magnus--> are you writing a haskell operating system or something?
09:49:15 <CosmicRay> heh, no :-)
09:49:21 <CosmicRay> magnus--: http://quux.org/devel/missingh
09:50:36 <ibid> gopher?!
09:50:49 <CosmicRay> of course :-)
09:50:59 <ibid> why?
09:51:12 <ibid> i don't think i've browsed gopher since mid-1990's
09:51:14 <CosmicRay> ibid: http://quux.org/devel/gopher/pygopherd :-)
09:51:33 <ibid> why don't you just give a gopher: url?
09:51:42 <CosmicRay> as for that question: http://gopher.quux.org:70/About%20This%20Server.txt
09:51:55 <arauko> But i think there is a haskell OS project on.
09:51:57 <CosmicRay> ibid: because until firefox is fixed, too few people know how to open them and it's faster to just give the http one
09:52:10 <CosmicRay> firefox 1.1 should be able to render gopher properly again.
09:52:23 <ibid> my firefox works with your gopher just fine
09:52:43 <CosmicRay> ibid: unless you have a 1.1 prerelease, it will leave off the 'i' itemtype -- the explanatory text on directory listings
09:52:53 <CosmicRay> for instance, some of the text at http://quux.org/ would be omitted
09:53:05 <CosmicRay> the "Welcome to gopher" bit.
09:53:37 <CosmicRay> anyway, my pygopherd server has built-in HTTP and WAP/WML views of gopherspace.
09:53:38 <ibid> yeah
09:53:49 <CosmicRay> it's a multi-protocol server with its own virtual filesystem concept
09:54:03 <CosmicRay> for instance, many of the files under /Archives are stored in 2 or 3 big ZIP files
09:54:13 <arauko> I thought haskell was the language (tool) for discriminating hackers http://www.ocaml.org/
09:54:13 <CosmicRay> you'd never know, though, because of the virtual filesystem under the hood.
09:54:42 <CosmicRay> so I'm generalizing that virtual filesystem concept, making it part of a library, and more applicable to others.
09:54:58 <CosmicRay> by the time I'm through, pygopherd will be 100 lines and offlineimap 200 :-)
09:56:14 <ibid> CosmicRay: and written in haskell? :)
09:56:18 <CosmicRay> of course :-)
09:56:52 <CosmicRay> the cool thing about the virtual filesystem layer (HVFS, I'm calling it) is that it is functional in a Haskellish way.
09:57:03 <CosmicRay> that is, one can make filesystem combinators or reason about them through monads.
09:57:38 <ibid> i mean, eventually _py_gopherd will be in haskell? :)
09:57:43 <CosmicRay> heh
09:57:47 <CosmicRay> I may have to rename it :-)
09:57:52 <ibid> why bother?
09:57:56 <CosmicRay> heh
09:58:03 <CosmicRay> I suppose I could say:
09:58:03 <CosmicRay> import os
09:58:11 <CosmicRay> os.system("runhugs pygopherd.hs")
09:58:11 <CosmicRay> :-)
09:58:22 <ski> heh
09:58:30 <ibid> or just develop a haskell<->python interface and use that

11:19:22 <CosmicRay> wow.
11:19:24 <CosmicRay> it all compiles now.
11:19:26 <CosmicRay> woot!
11:19:27 <ski> but then you'll have to use two constructors
11:19:38 <ski> but you can at least use the record syntax
11:19:44 * CosmicRay quickly does a tla commit :-)
11:20:05 <ski> like "FTPServer (FTPServ {handle = h, fs = f})"
11:20:34 <CosmicRay> sweet.
11:20:43 <CosmicRay> well, not that, but that this is working.
11:20:55 <CosmicRay> ski: thanks very much for all your help.  Can I dcc you a beer? :-)
11:21:02 <ski> you can of course make abbreviations/renamings of some or both of the constructors (so it won't be so long to write), if you want
11:21:07 <ski> hm
11:21:24 <ski> i think dcc does not support that format
11:21:28 <CosmicRay> heh
11:21:40 <ski> (anyway i rarely drink beer)
11:22:14 <CosmicRay> diet pepsi then? :-)
11:22:24 <ski> heh
11:22:42 <ski> anyway, nice to be able to help some ..
12:32:56 <pesco> Tach.
12:36:43 <Lemmih> Hey pesco.
12:39:47 <pesco> Hello Lemmih.
12:53:43 <ibid> MegaMonad: how do you like darcs?
12:53:48 <MegaMonad> ibid: Learnt me lots of time, whereas deserialize does not dislike clean itself. It's best to see what a darcs i can pick up bits.
12:58:20 <dustin`> Is there a generally recommended framework for making web applications in haskell?
13:00:21 <Lunar^> dustin`: Try halipeto
13:00:32 <Lunar^> dustin`: Though WASH isn't bad
13:00:41 <Lunar^> both have different purpose, anyway
13:02:24 <dustin`> cool, thanks..
13:10:09 <Lemmih> dustin`: I'm using a dynamic version of halipeto for Hackage.
13:11:53 <dustin`> Hackage?
13:13:04 <Lemmih> dustin`: Haskell package listing service.
13:13:49 <dustin`> ahh
13:40:51 <jadrian> does anyone know "Herbert Graeber" ?
13:41:15 <kristnjov> he's a friend of mine
13:41:39 <jadrian> kristnjov: I noticed he packaged quite a few haskell related software
13:41:49 <kristnjov> i'm such a liar, sorry man :/
13:41:54 <jadrian> eh :)
13:42:10 <kristnjov> i know, i suck :/
13:42:15 <jadrian> lol
13:43:00 <jadrian> I'm thinking about posting something in the mailing list about it
13:43:20 <kristnjov> me being a liar or herbert graeber?
13:43:32 <jadrian> eh, probably both
13:43:42 <kristnjov> :D
13:44:23 <CosmicRay> "packaged" meaning what?
13:44:26 <CosmicRay> packaged for debian?
13:44:28 <CosmicRay> cabalized?
13:44:30 <CosmicRay> written
13:44:38 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: who is a liar?
13:44:50 <jadrian> packaged for SuSE
13:44:51 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Abstrato_general is a liar?
13:44:53 <jadrian> (9.2)
13:44:56 <CosmicRay> ah.
13:45:04 <tuomov> MegaMonad: are you lying?
13:45:15 <MegaMonad> tuomov: Or maybe it's a bloody plane by now to avoid it where it might be tempted to use function composition and it's an obvious way to get paid a lot of x86 asm lying around as an interface'. That's what i said i will release parts or if you have me there.
13:45:41 <jadrian> CosmicRay: ghc, happy, alex, darcs, wxhaskell
13:46:07 <wolfman8k> is wxhaskell any good?
13:46:47 <Lemmih> I'm quite fond of it, although it's hard to utilize on a Linux box.
13:47:30 <jadrian> don't know, I prefer kde/qt apps myself so I haven't tried any of the available gui libs for haskell
13:48:13 <jadrian> I wonder if someone, someday, will bother to make kde/qt bindings...
13:48:39 <wolfman8k> are there gtk bindings for haskell?
13:48:46 <jadrian> yeap
13:48:49 <wolfman8k> cool
13:49:23 <jadrian> also wx uses gtk in linux
13:49:51 <wolfman8k> yeah but it's buggy as shit
13:49:56 <CosmicRay> wx?
13:50:02 <CosmicRay> I've never found it to be buggy
13:51:51 <jadrian> MegaMonad: is wxWidgets buggy?
13:51:56 <MegaMonad> jadrian: It's really simple.  Consider a computation with an fpl to write buggy code that jamie w. Zawinski had written non-trivial buggy programs.
13:52:07 <CosmicRay> BWAHAHAHA.
14:02:28 <ski> heh
14:05:23 <wolfman8k> the gtk version of wx is buggy. i think the windows version is the one that gets most of the focus
14:15:10 <ski> MegaMonad: why is the gtk verion of wx buggy ?
14:15:16 <MegaMonad> ski: So then i have used wx in the first verion of this box to run some files of stuff in sequence of stack operations to be buggy.
14:16:42 <wolfman8k> dude, i have never understood a single thing that you have ever said
14:17:59 <Darius> Hey Pseudonym, have you read the paper, "Practical Lock-Freedom"?
14:18:06 <ski> wolfman8k: MegaMonad won't respond unless you do "MegaMonad: ..."
14:18:26 <aFlag> a haskell book from 1996 would be too old?
14:18:36 <wolfman8k> i don't need a response from him.... i won't understand it anyway :/
14:19:30 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: see ths page:
14:19:33 <CosmicRay> @wiki MegaMonad
14:19:34 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MegaMonad
14:19:44 <wolfman8k> wtf this shit keeps getting weirder
14:20:16 <wolfman8k> haha, he's a bot!! oh man that's good
14:20:26 <aFlag> i wanted to get the 2nd edition of haskell - the craft of functional programming, but it was rented so i ended up getting the one from 1996
14:20:27 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: you didn't know? :-)
14:20:43 <Pseudonym> Nope.
14:20:47 <aFlag> were classtypes on haskell then?
14:20:52 <Pseudonym> What's "Practical Lock-Freedom" about?
14:20:52 <wolfman8k> haha, no... i thought he was some crazy stoned guy or something
14:21:04 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: heh, not much difference there :-)
14:21:15 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: that is good, though -- MegaMonad may have just passed the Turing test :-)
14:21:19 <Pseudonym> Sounds like a cryptoanalytic attack against chastity belts.
14:21:54 <aFlag> :-(
14:22:06 <Darius> Pseudonym: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~kaf24/lockfree.html
14:22:24 <ski> CosmicRay : :D
14:28:07 <aFlag> answer me please :(
14:28:30 <wolfman8k> i thought that MegaMonad was making highly sophisticated jokes and i just didn't get them :/
14:28:39 <CosmicRay> hehe
14:28:44 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: nobody got them :-)
14:29:00 <CosmicRay> aFlag: I don't know, but there are some good things linked frmo haskell.org
14:29:04 <CosmicRay> yet another haskell tutorial is one
14:34:34 <Pseudonym> Darius: Interesting!
14:34:41 <Pseudonym> I'll have to send this around work.
14:34:52 <Pseudonym> Database servers are very lock-heavy.
14:34:52 <CosmicRay> wolfman8k: though there were some great quotes on that wiki page
14:35:02 <aFlag> i know about yet another haskell tutorial, i wanted a book though
14:35:36 <CosmicRay> lpr can turn it into one :-)
14:36:15 <wolfman8k> btw, i finally put some info about my haskell program
14:36:16 <wolfman8k> http://benny.kramekweb.com/hrayt/
14:41:36 <paf> MegaMonad: who is your favorite bot?
14:41:41 <MegaMonad> paf: It's my favorite language so far is that your generators to do a bilinear interpolation of the bot to evaluate my stuff.
14:42:00 <ski> @wiki MegaMonad/PassingTuringTest
14:42:00 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MegaMonad/PassingTuringTest
14:42:53 <CosmicRay> excellent.
14:43:45 <ski> should it be trimmed more ? or ok ?
14:43:55 <SyntaxNinja> wolfman8k: lol
14:44:04 <CosmicRay> maybe wrap lines, but it's good
14:44:58 * CosmicRay adds a link from the MegaMonad page.
14:45:32 <zamez> nice, wolfman8k
14:45:41 <zamez> I like the last rendering
14:45:54 <wolfman8k> a mathematician set up that scene :)
14:47:23 * ski is not sure how to wrap .. just cut lines somewhere (74 ?) ?
14:51:04 <CosmicRay> yup
14:51:12 <CosmicRay> just insert a newline and some spaces to make it line up nicely
14:55:18 <ski> ok ?
14:58:23 <CosmicRay> looks great
15:00:40 <ski> ty
15:11:07 <jdrake> do you guys know of any web software that I can use to post a repository of my code? I would like to be able to refer to it, perhaps allow comments, ammendments, etc.
15:11:52 <musasabi> something between a darcs repo and a wiki... 
15:13:09 <jdrake> lisp paste would be something that would be a good start, because it provides numbered entries. But the entries aren't restricted to whom can paste one, and no comments.
15:19:00 <Darius> jdrake: It would seem like most wikis would let you achieve this.
15:25:34 <redhatPT> hi everyone
15:26:11 <SyntaxNinja> hi
15:26:35 <ski> hello redhatPT
15:27:17 <redhatPT> i got a problem here
15:27:27 <redhatPT> calcMinLista :: [Int] -> Int
15:27:27 <redhatPT> calcMinLista [] = 0
15:27:27 <redhatPT> calcMinLista l = auxMinLista l 0
15:27:27 <redhatPT> 	where auxMinLista :: [Int] -> Int -> Int
15:27:27 <redhatPT> 	      auxMinLista [] ac = ac
15:27:27 <redhatPT> 	      auxMinLista (x:xs) ac = if (x<ac) then auxMinLista xs x
15:27:29 <redhatPT> 				      else auxMinLista xs ac
15:27:42 <redhatPT> it should return the lower value....
15:27:51 <redhatPT> where's the problem?
15:28:05 <kristnjov> /ruN G:\mp3\
15:28:07 <kristnjov> oj
15:28:49 <redhatPT> it returns allways 0 ...
15:31:28 <aFlag> the base case for auxminlista is when the list is empty
15:31:53 <aFlag> actually
15:32:01 <aFlag> ac is always 0
15:32:29 <aFlag> don't pay attention to me :(
15:32:31 <Darius> redhatPT: You start at 0, nothing will be less than that if you only have positive numbers.
15:33:05 <Darius> Perhaps you want auxMinLista l maxBound.
15:33:20 <redhatPT> humm
15:33:50 <Darius> Alternatively, you could rip off the first element to start.
15:34:08 <Darius> And still more alternatively, you could just use minimum.
15:34:34 <redhatPT> Darius cant do ir
15:34:37 <redhatPT> *it
15:34:47 <redhatPT> or better, can't use it
16:21:28 <musasabi> Can haskelldb handle inserting a new primary key with serial/autoincrement?
16:22:06 <Lemmih> Yes.
16:25:50 <stepcut> musasabi: if you just insert that field with a null value, it will automatically to the autoincrement 
16:25:52 <stepcut> (i think)
16:26:34 <stepcut> musasabi: if you want to get the auto increment value back, that is posible too
16:27:08 <stepcut> but is likely not very portable
16:27:14 <stepcut> (to other database backends)
16:27:24 <musasabi> hmm I don't think NULL works with postgresql.. 
16:27:42 <musasabi> but the haskelldb improved paper seems to talk about _default ^_^
17:58:24 <MegaMonad> Boegel is quite welcome.
18:13:22 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: it is too quiet in here.
18:13:25 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: can you stir up some action?
18:13:27 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: I wonder which webpage this really an n-cpu machine is too quiet in here i've been bullying him quite seriously.
18:13:32 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: some excitement maybe?
18:13:44 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Can you stir up some of the action in a version of the i/o services which look close to me, then?
18:13:50 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Igloo: i mean, the debian unstable packages (have a tiny bit of adrenaline & excitement.
18:14:22 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: that's not good enough.
18:14:27 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: And you always put enough of that.
18:14:30 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: I think you should organize a raid on Microsoft.
18:14:35 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Transformational patterns are pretty good when youre able to raid it so that they lost your chance to do a little bit about the microsoft one.
18:14:42 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: burn their buggy operating system media!
18:14:47 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Yes, i did get yampa space invaders is an object system based on the stack, if the media type to be buggy.
18:15:37 <ibid> MegaMonad: is there a cabal?
18:15:42 <MegaMonad> ibid: Cabal would make a cabal on my freebsd's ghc-6.2.
18:15:51 <ibid> MegaMonad: indeed
18:15:57 <MegaMonad> ibid: Goron: as in freiburg in breisgau ?
18:16:02 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: what do you know of ibid?
18:16:08 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Ibid, how much does that makes it even though have x thousands of nerds who want me to pull again if i can think of, i can skip that bit about some things.
18:16:21 <ibid> MegaMonad: i think ghc is a memory hog, don't you agree?
18:16:26 <MegaMonad> ibid: Sorry, memory is a hog, but it's really correct.
18:16:35 <CosmicRay> MegaMonad: "x thousands of nerds", eh?  are you talking about Debian?
18:16:40 <MegaMonad> CosmicRay: Math nerds: is there another which should be talking on my debian machine.
18:16:50 <arauko> Can someone get connected to irc.haskell.org?
18:17:03 <ibid> arauko: oh, there is such a thing?
18:17:25 <arauko> according to haskell.org there is.
18:17:29 <CosmicRay> *** There are 1 users and 0 services on 1 servers
18:17:30 <CosmicRay> *** 11 channels have been formed
18:17:34 <CosmicRay> arauko: I wouldn't bother with it.
18:17:35 <arauko> but i can't get connected to it.
18:17:52 <CosmicRay> oh, all the channels are fake.
18:18:08 <CosmicRay> &LOCAL Unauthorized connection from arauko[unknown@201.243.47.56].
18:18:17 <CosmicRay> anyway
18:18:17 <arauko> yes.
18:18:22 <CosmicRay> I am the 1 user on the server.
18:18:26 <arauko> :-P
18:18:33 * CosmicRay disconnects.
18:18:33 <arauko> you manage it?
18:18:43 <CosmicRay> no, I checked it out just now, since you mentioned it.
18:18:47 <CosmicRay> I had never heard of it before
18:19:03 <CosmicRay> I think it is not worth my time being connected to
18:19:07 <arauko> hah, and how did you get that message of my problem?
18:19:12 <CosmicRay> speaking to nobody is even worse than speaking to MegaMonad

18:23:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: one can always count on getting a honest, to the point answer from you :)
18:23:36 <MegaMonad> ibid: Does point have to traverse a need to be honest.
18:23:50 <ibid> MegaMonad: traversing a need? that's new
18:23:55 <MegaMonad> ibid: Has anyone seen a need to the choir, or the value? I'm not new.
18:24:06 <ibid> MegaMonad: newer than i
18:24:11 <MegaMonad> ibid: What i want, but you could use th to run lintian to see structure of that type of that into a particular type of something? That would be nice if you don't want you to understand newer x86 extensions.
18:24:34 <ibid> MegaMonad: yeah, newer x86 extensions hate me too
18:24:39 <MegaMonad> ibid: You would love the haskell extensions.
18:24:47 <ibid> MegaMonad: possibly
18:24:52 <MegaMonad> ibid: Then again, one classic characterization of objects of (possibly) different types.
18:25:00 <ibid> MegaMonad: yes?
18:25:05 <MegaMonad> ibid: Theres no difference?
18:32:22 <ski> MegaMonad: whether (possibly) different types are different or not depends on the 'possibly'
18:32:28 <MegaMonad> ski: Possibly you want types to a different error message.
18:33:29 <ski> MegaMonad: i thought you were speaking generally here. but now it seems like you have something specific in mind. care to elaborate ?
18:33:35 <MegaMonad> ski: Generally you need to elaborate.
18:33:41 <ibid> MegaMonad: typed error messages, now that's a thought!
18:33:47 <MegaMonad> ibid: Then error is that there's a thought.
18:33:59 <ski> MegaMonad: of course. don't state the obvious
18:34:05 <MegaMonad> ski: State is, of course, make is nothing left to do state.
18:34:21 <ibid> MegaMonad: maybe so. but lack of thought is a horrifying thought
18:34:26 <MegaMonad> ibid: It should be invasion of the second sentence given in a thought of the idea of) haskell's semantics is horrifying.
18:34:31 <ski> ibid : i agree
18:35:12 <ski> MegaMonad: oh, so you don't like all the type class extensions, eh ?
18:35:14 <ibid> MegaMonad: semantics is fun
18:35:17 <MegaMonad> ski: Now that's just me that's a stupid question that's why i'm playing with some extensions in haskell class.
18:35:23 <MegaMonad> ibid: Fun fun fun.
18:35:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: exactly!
18:35:36 <MegaMonad> ibid: Bbl: exactly my philosophy.
18:35:44 <ibid> MegaMonad: is that so?
18:35:50 <MegaMonad> ibid: I think an engish iso standard for leetspeak?
18:36:08 <ski> MegaMonad: how come then you think of it as horrifying ?
18:36:14 <ibid> MegaMonad: i'm conversing with a megahal on two different channels at the same time. how leet is that?
18:36:14 <MegaMonad> ski: Use system.time.getclocktime is a flying machine, a vessel which flies through the cracks on fst and snd are they doing it for you and me to think i have been hacking on now is the main problem is that there is a horrifying thought.
18:36:20 <MegaMonad> ibid: Can you explain how monadic adts could/would be different if you slice their brain comes out having the time is more leet!
18:36:38 <ibid> MegaMonad: i'm sorry but no
18:36:39 <ski> hahahaha !
18:36:43 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes yes yes.
18:36:48 <ibid> MegaMonad: no no no
18:36:55 <ski> ibid : it disagrees !
18:36:55 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes, i can imagine what it is.
18:37:04 <ibid> MegaMonad: maybe you can!
18:37:09 <MegaMonad> ibid: Ok, 'good programmers' aren't as common as in newtype heap a = heap { heapsize :: int, heaplength :: int, ... }  You don't even have to put %word1%word2.
18:37:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: now that's a thought!
18:37:35 <MegaMonad> ibid: Thought i did that people would like to leave right now, i think this child gets any more thought to have high overhead in anything.
18:39:56 <ski> MegaMonad: well, you are correct in that i ought to leave, at least
18:40:02 <MegaMonad> ski: This ought to leave, which is very much actually, copying old bytes still accounts for you?
18:40:43 <ski> MegaMonad: yes, actually it does. there are many good old nuggets
18:40:49 <MegaMonad> ski: There is some old programming books so i could build it from home to good old nuggets.
18:41:09 <ibid> MegaMonad: my megahal just admitted that it's a he on the othewr channel. how about you?
18:41:14 <MegaMonad> ibid: Admitted, it was impossible for a channel in the mailing lists?
18:41:30 <ibid> MegaMonad: quite true. but aren't you avoiding the subject?
18:41:33 <ski> MegaMonad: i was more thinking of stuff like e.g. C64 computer games
18:41:36 <MegaMonad> ibid: I've been avoiding it for a thesis, so she is paying me to a subject.
18:41:42 <MegaMonad> ski: Shapr: that's what i wrote some haskell games i want c to the computer?
18:42:31 <ski> MegaMonad: unfortunately i haven't ported haskell to the C64 yet :(
18:42:36 <MegaMonad> ski: Haskell c and bind are supposed to be ported.
18:43:00 <ski> MegaMonad: (though (subsets of) c are actually ported)
18:43:06 <MegaMonad> ski: I ported my one was the first c of c to write that kind of ugly.
18:43:54 <ski> MegaMonad: no. haskell is definitely not ported. bind i don't know about, but i think not. (tcp/ip stack would be another case ..)
18:44:00 <MegaMonad> ski: It usually takes me hours to track the beast and uses the yacc syntax to tyop at some point you to use the bind of the b out to be ported.
18:45:28 <ski> MegaMonad: are you trying to make some joke regarding beast and yacc, huh ?
18:45:34 <MegaMonad> ski: Huh, there is such a beast of a yacc grammar.
18:45:56 <ibid> MegaMonad: have you seen my ketchup language yet?
18:46:00 <ski> MegaMonad: indeed. i even think there are many of them
18:46:02 <MegaMonad> ibid: State your reason for me to be about the language is good with ketchup?
18:46:08 <MegaMonad> ski: Now, you realize you don't know if i've installed it, but in terms of open-source helpline; i think it might cost $50/year for an institution for ???-ary education (the kind you take out the diagram for a bit.
18:46:22 <ibid> MegaMonad: i'm just a pushy little (well, big) fool
18:46:28 <MegaMonad> ibid: You're at the current code is just a pushy little (well, big) fool.
18:46:38 <ibid> MegaMonad: thanks
18:46:43 <MegaMonad> ibid: Yes, read the pierce book here at cwi.
18:46:50 <ibid> MegaMonad: i've read it
18:46:55 <MegaMonad> ibid: Oh, you've told me to read the papers.
18:47:02 <ibid> MegaMonad: i have? that's news.
18:47:06 <ski> MegaMonad: the Types and Programming Languages book ?
18:47:08 <MegaMonad> ibid: Philippa: so in dx:iw, can you think i built you a link for you : http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8862.
18:47:14 <MegaMonad> ski: Of course you have to go looking for languages that i had to be programming in a book, is that you eventually pick up cabal.description yet.
18:47:34 <ibid> MegaMonad: programming in a book. that's a concept.
18:47:40 <MegaMonad> ibid: Oh, so the book for a concept.
18:47:49 <ski> haha
18:47:50 <ibid> MegaMonad: thanks for the url, btw
18:48:00 <MegaMonad> ibid: Btw it should have an interview on thursday btw.
18:48:09 <ibid> MegaMonad: it meaning you?
18:48:14 <ibid> MegaMonad: good luck
18:48:14 <MegaMonad> ibid: Let me see if i run darcs get --partial and seem to me like a one step intervals, meaning it will chime for that since the first incarnation.
18:48:20 <MegaMonad> ibid: Rapid prototype, violent code review and / or hack on mosml than on his desktop... Wish me luck.
18:48:45 <ski> MegaMonad : can you really build links yourself. are you sure you didn't pilfer it from somewhere ?
18:48:49 <ski> MegaMonad: can you really build links yourself. are you sure you didn't pilfer it from somewhere ?
18:48:56 <MegaMonad> ski: Hm. Doesn't look signed. This is much easier to implement nifty programming languages or more elements to give it to me, and then keep state between each iteration to generate random instances of java interfaces if you didn't pilfer it from a list of all links.
18:49:30 * ski lols
18:49:47 <ibid> MegaMonad: used firefox recently?
18:49:51 <ski> "generate random instances of java interfaces" hehehe
18:49:52 <MegaMonad> ibid: With firefox you can hand to qsort.
18:50:00 <ibid> MegaMonad: gee
18:50:06 <MegaMonad> ibid: Gee, forming the question i'm answering.
18:50:29 <ibid> i once started to program an editor called gee
18:50:41 <ibid> actually, i have several unfinished editor projects
18:50:49 <ibid> one of them was ie - ibid's editor :)
18:50:51 <ski> MegaMonad: actually, i don't think "gee" constitutes a question
18:51:01 <MegaMonad> ski: Gee, i can do macros in the a and n is the question?
18:51:35 * ski has only one editor project lying somewhere (in 6502 asm on C64)
18:52:08 <ski> MegaMonad: how old are you actually ?
18:52:13 <MegaMonad> ski: So anything i'd rather know more about it as the old site rather than me and the haskell program, i get ghci to tell it what is going to send me more suggestions.
18:53:32 <ski> MegaMonad: ok, you're the shy type. that's ok too. you don't have to tell us. (but we will still guess, you know)
18:53:38 <MegaMonad> ski: I'm have to guess the type of computation analysis.
18:54:04 <ski> MegaMonad: what kind of computation analysis ?
18:54:10 <MegaMonad> ski: List comprehension is nifty because the static analysis makes me use my math analysis exam.
18:55:12 <ski> MegaMonad: how do you mean the comprehensions are analyzed statically ?
18:55:18 <MegaMonad> ski: Analyzed all of those sorts of mapping it over one hundred in less than the very first few days at a time, but then try: throwdyn (bderror "whee"), it could note that hopengl is a statically typed i would think.
18:56:53 <ski> MegaMonad: hmm. maybe you could at least try to explain what bderror does ? is it some kind of smart constructor ?
18:56:59 <MegaMonad> ski: Bderror instead of the smart constructor and a float.
18:57:55 <ski> MegaMonad: ok. if you want it that way. but i don't see how you could have a number instead of the string
18:58:00 <MegaMonad> ski: Marvin--: doesn't seem to be a number in the string?
18:58:28 <ski> MegaMonad: correct. there is none. caught you !
18:58:34 <MegaMonad> ski: This allows me to a function that does something?" but once i build the product of both projects under something like that sort of package base wouldn't need it to me right into my programming in general. Maybe it would be correct.
18:59:35 <ski> MegaMonad: hmm, that's an idea. taking the product of projects. this wouldn't happen to be categorical product, would it ?
18:59:41 <MegaMonad> ski: He wouldn't have a lot to know, but i don't happen in the product.
19:00:38 <ski> MegaMonad: bah. i don't think you know anything about category theory.
19:00:44 <MegaMonad> ski: It reminded me of the category of the theory.
19:01:01 <ibid> MegaMonad: ah, *the* theory!
19:01:06 <MegaMonad> ibid: If you have a theory of type theory stuff?
19:01:09 <jadrian> lol MegaMonad, ski is just a bot! :P
19:01:44 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, ski is just a bot!
19:01:50 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: A is an invariant that refers to a bot.
19:02:01 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, what is B?
19:02:07 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: (Uncurry id :: (a -> b, a) -> b.
19:02:17 <ski> MegaMonad: it just dawned upon me that you might be referring to the Lawvere-style theory-as-abstract-category. please continue
19:02:18 <Riastradh> MegaMonad, OK, that clears it all up!  Thanks.
19:02:23 <MegaMonad> ski: It's abstract in the graph category in my style.
19:02:29 <MegaMonad> Riastradh: Aren't both views it got killed for something like, that clears it up yesterday and it clears up the expression.
19:03:40 <ski> MegaMonad: and what style would that happen to be ? irreflexive mayhaps ?
19:03:45 <MegaMonad> ski: Mayhaps some of the happen to make hugs callable by c.. Maybe i'll do some of the line.
19:04:21 <ski> MegaMonad: i think that is already possible, isn't it ?
19:04:26 <MegaMonad> ski: Sjc: are you willing to try to avoid ruining highlighting at the simplest possible would be possible, i think i should study how linkers work for choosing microsoft, right?
19:06:45 <ski> MegaMonad: well, i tire talking now. i'll try to continue this interesting discussion with you another time. good night
19:06:51 <MegaMonad> ski: Unsure if they're sparse and not interesting all the time in the discussion.
19:09:17 <ski> MegaMonad: (um, maybe one last question. what do you think of the game ccard ? you know, the one with texts on the cards such as "Equivalent subobjects have isomorphic domains" (it's at http://www.verify-it.de/sub/ccard/index.html if you haven't seen it before))
19:09:22 <MegaMonad> ski: Control.monad.error.html you can turn any number of cards in a game in haskell (on account of how vixenlove would respond.
19:09:46 <ski> MegaMonad: ok, that's all, good night
19:09:51 <MegaMonad> ski: Sorry i left the station on sunday night, but i consider it night.
19:38:01 <srid> I started (just started) learning haskell, but looks liike I need some fore-knowledge before starting to learn it.  I don't know any FP language.  Do you think by learning Lisp first, I could learn haskell better?
19:38:53 <ibid> srid: not necessarily
19:40:15 <Pseudonym> Many people find Haskell easier on the eyes.
19:40:50 <Pseudonym> What kind of fore-knowledge are you thinking of?
19:42:32 <srid> easier even no prior FP experience?
19:42:48 <srid> *if no
19:44:23 <Riastradh> Many people also find Lisp easier on the eyes & that Haskell has too many arbitrary symbols with no extra-Haskell linguistic value.
19:45:20 <srid> i started with YAHT
19:45:24 <srid> but vague it is
19:45:32 <srid> even the online tutorial (h.org/tutorial)
19:46:32 <srid> which to learn first? lisp or haskell?
19:46:54 <Riastradh> Whichever you'd prefer.
19:47:00 <Riastradh> It also depends on which Lisp dialect you're talking about.
19:47:06 <srid> common lisp
19:47:35 <ibid> srid: it doesn't matter, it's as hard - of course lisp allow you to ignore some of the issues, but then learning lisp won't help in learning haskell
19:47:36 <Riastradh> It would have been a closer match had you said Scheme.
19:49:16 <Riastradh> You should read SICP <http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/> regardless of whether you learn Scheme or Haskell first, too.
19:50:18 <srid> thanks for your answers
19:50:27 <srid> Riastradh:  is SICP dealing with FP theory?
19:50:38 <Riastradh> SICP deals with a lot of topics in computer science.
19:50:40 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: Scheme is easier on the eyes than Lisp.
19:50:56 <Pseudonym> IMO
19:51:04 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, unless you erroneously mean 'Common Lisp' when you say 'Lisp,' that is a meaningless statement.
19:51:21 <Pseudonym> I mean "lisp" as opposed to "scheme".
19:51:38 <Riastradh> What opposition?  The former is a superset of the languages the latter represents.
19:51:42 <Pseudonym> Emacs Lisp is even harder on the eyes, though that's possibly because there's a lot of bad code out there in Emacs Lisp.
19:52:13 <Riastradh> Elisp is also a Lisp dialect that really originated several decades ago, as Maclisp, and has not progressed with the rest of the Lisp world.
19:52:30 <Pseudonym> BTW, learning both Haskell and Lisp/Echeme/whatever will help your programming in just about every other language.
19:52:49 <Pseudonym> So the question is moot.
19:53:15 <srid> Pseudonym: learning order is important
19:53:29 <Pseudonym> No, I'd disagree with that, except for one proviso.
19:53:39 <srid> what's that?
19:53:41 <Pseudonym> If you learn languages in the wrong order, there's stuff to unlearn.
19:53:45 <Riastradh> It is not so much a particular language itself as the concepts on which the languages are founded.  This is one reason, indeed one would probably say the main reason, why Scheme is used as the basis for SICP: Scheme is a language whose syntax does not get in the way and whose semantics are very flexible & expressive.
19:54:10 <Pseudonym> Right.  Scheme is almost ideal for SICP.
19:55:02 <Pseudonym> So, for example, I wouldn't bother learning Miranda before Haskell.  Just learn Haskell.
19:55:16 <ibid> Pseudonym: almost?
19:55:29 <ibid> i learned haskell programming from a miranda textbook :)
19:55:35 <Pseudonym> ibid: Yes, almost.
19:55:42 <ibid> (though i had some prior exposure to haskell)
19:55:48 <ibid> Pseudonym: how so?
19:55:50 <Pseudonym> The author could have, in theory, come up with their own language instead of using Scheme.
19:55:56 <Pseudonym> By definition that would be ideal.
19:56:00 <ibid> heh
19:56:02 <Pseudonym> :-)
19:56:02 <ibid> the authors
19:56:08 <Pseudonym> Yes, authors.
19:56:21 <ibid> well, aren't the authors on the rnrs committee?
19:56:23 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, well, that's what they did...
19:56:47 <srid> will SICP also teach scheme?
19:56:52 <srid> or should I learn scheme first?
19:56:55 <Pseudonym> Scheme was invented by Guy Steele in the 70s.
19:57:04 <Riastradh> It will not teach Scheme in its entirety, and the entirety of Scheme is not necessary to read SICP.
19:57:06 <Pseudonym> SICP came later.
19:57:12 <ibid> srid: sicp will teach most of what you need of scheme
19:57:17 <ibid> Pseudonym: i know
19:57:30 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, more specifically, Scheme was invented by Guy Steele & Gerald Sussman in 1975.  Note the latter author.
19:57:33 <srid> so i can read sicp without going for scheme first
19:57:42 <Pseudonym> Ah, good point.
19:57:48 <Pseudonym> Still, Scheme wasn't invented for SICP.
19:57:55 <Pseudonym> Scheme was invented as a better Lisp.
19:58:11 <ibid> srid: sicp is intended for people with no previous programming experience, though it's useful for all
19:58:23 <Riastradh> It was invented for Sussman & Steele to investigate programming language theory fundamentals in the simplest form Sussman & Steele could construct.
19:58:23 <Pseudonym> Better in the easier-to-compile sense, and better in the removing-the-ugly-semantic-issues sense.
19:58:36 <Pseudonym> Are you sure?
19:58:57 <srid> ibid: oh, but I am already a programmer
19:58:57 <ibid> Pseudonym: scheme came from sussman & steele's experiments with actors etc
19:58:57 <Pseudonym> I've read the original Scheme paper.  It looks to me like they were trying to make a better language for the AI Lab.
19:59:05 <ibid> srid: as i said, it's useful for all
19:59:13 <Riastradh> Yes.  That is why all of the lambda papers were published: to demonstrate how Scheme could model so many different paradigms of programming language.
19:59:23 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
20:01:02 <Pseudonym> OK, well, I don't know as much about the history of Scheme as I thought. :-)
20:01:18 <Pseudonym> I still think Scheme is a better Lisp.
20:01:19 <Riastradh> It wasn't exactly originally precisely for that goal, but rather for the two to understand Actors better by implementing them; they then proceeded to find how simple the language was, and following that they published the lambda papers.
20:05:23 <Riastradh> So it would perhaps be more accurate to say, rather than that they invented Scheme to design a curriculum on programming language theory, they invented a small toy to investigate it themselves of which they soon realized the full power in expressiveness for that area of study.
20:05:30 <Pseudonym> Right.
20:05:34 <Pseudonym> That works.
20:08:09 <Riastradh> In any case, they had deliberately designed their ideal language for that purpose beforehand.
20:35:48 <cm> hey
20:36:33 <cm> can you do something like #ifdef UNIX ... #endif in haskell?
20:37:12 <Binkley> yes
20:37:15 <Binkley> if you're using ghc
20:37:28 <cm> just exactly like that? or what's the define called like, do you know?
20:37:32 <Binkley> it's exactly the same
20:37:35 <Binkley> ghc runs cpp on source code
20:37:41 <Binkley> you may need to supply a particular flag to do so
20:38:25 <cm> I mean, do you know what's the "platform define" on platforms that support the unix-only modules in the hierarchical libs?
20:39:37 <Binkley> should be the same as in C
20:40:07 <cm> what is it in C?
20:40:15 <Binkley> i don't know offhand
20:40:18 <cm> k
20:40:23 <cm> thx anyway
20:40:31 <Binkley> should be able to find it in any C or Unix reference manual
20:43:59 <cm> is it possible to specify -package lang via a pragma? {-# OPTIONS -package lang #-} doesn't work
21:09:02 <ibid> okay, why does
21:09:04 <ibid>  case minBound :: Int of { maxBound -> "!!!" ; _ -> "---" }
21:09:11 <ibid> evaluate to "!!!" and not to "---"?
21:10:00 <ibid> ahh
21:10:06 <ibid> my bad, of course :)
21:10:22 <ibid> maxBound is a pattern and hence shadows the constant
21:20:01 <cm> well, a "variable" in the pattern, but yes
21:20:42 <cm> (_ is also a pattern)
21:38:27 <thebug> @tell bendahmon about ibm java 1.4.2
21:38:28 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "tell", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
