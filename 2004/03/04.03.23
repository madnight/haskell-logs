00:00:37 <Pseudonym> Nytol!
00:56:33 <bring> is sending money to Geneva the only way to get a copy of ISO 8601?
00:56:44 <earthy> probably
00:56:55 <earthy> ISO is reasonably annoying when it comes to getting hold of their standards
00:57:47 <bring> imho, that's silly, they're standards, they should be publicly available
00:57:59 <earthy> they are, but the standards process needs to be funded
00:58:23 <earthy> some of that funding comes from the organizations employing the people that write the standards
00:58:33 <earthy> some of it from the governments that abide by the ISO standards
00:58:35 <Jerub> earthy: or ignored, and the iso guys are good at doing both!
00:58:36 <Jerub> ;)
00:58:49 <bring> that's what government should be for, it's like the police saying they need funding, so they charge to help you
00:59:20 <earthy> bring: you know about the UK map service?
00:59:27 <bring> no
00:59:37 <earthy> best maps in the world, fully paid for by government money
00:59:38 <bring> they charge for access to maps?
00:59:47 <earthy> however, to get one you pay. dearly.
01:00:25 <bring> we've got the same deal here in Sweden, the maps are there but you have to pay, even for electronic copies
01:00:52 <bring> but I think standards reaaly should be public, that's their only purpose really
01:01:00 <Jerub> yeah, but they're survey maps aren't tehy?
01:01:16 <Jerub> shit I wish I could get decent survey maps of my city.
01:02:18 <bring> our university library have stopped buying ISO standards too, they said it got too expensive
01:02:29 * earthy can imagine
01:02:54 <earthy> otoh: bring, usually, national standards bodies provide nationalized versions of the ISO standards
01:03:04 <earthy> those might be a bit cheaper
01:03:10 <bring> hmm, I'll look into that
01:03:11 <bring> thanks
01:03:21 <Heffalump> OS (Ordnance Survey, the UK map service earthy mentioned) maps aren't that expensive
01:03:38 <bring> probably not SQL92 though, but maybe ISO8601
01:03:39 <Heffalump> I assumed that the cost of them goes to defray government subsidy of the OS.
01:03:53 <Heffalump> (where else would it go?)
01:05:28 <earthy> what I gathered is that the ordnance survey maps bring in a decent amount of profit
01:05:55 <earthy> (and thanks, I got the survey part, but couldn't for the life of me remember what should be in front of it ;))
01:06:13 <Heffalump> I imagine they do, but the cost isn't extortionate
01:06:41 <Jerub> earthy: ordinance survey -> the kind of thing that makes artillery easier to use.
01:06:44 <Jerub> ;)
01:07:23 <earthy> jerub: I know what it means, I had simply forgotten ;)
01:07:55 <Heffalump> I'm not quite sure where the 'i' went in the name.
01:08:47 <bring> hey, cool the swedish standars body sells the first (obsolete) edition of 8601 for SEK 0
01:08:58 <earthy> ummm... ordnance is spelled correctly
01:09:16 <bring> the 2nd is EUR 85
01:09:19 <earthy> ordinance has a somewhat different meaning. ;)
01:09:26 <earthy> bring: see. ;)
01:09:47 <Heffalump> oh. Duh :-)
01:09:54 <Heffalump> I should learn my own language better...
01:10:26 <earthy> (and I simply discarded the i in jerub's text ;))
01:10:58 <earthy> hef: silly thing is, I'll be learning your language better, starting monday ;)
01:11:19 <Heffalump> sorry?
01:11:36 <Jerub> taking english lessons?
01:12:04 <earthy> (there's a course on `Writing English for Academic Texts', as well as a course on `Presenting Academic Results in English')
01:12:10 <earthy> (I'm taking both)
01:12:13 <Heffalump> ah :-)
01:12:15 <Heffalump> Do you have to?
01:12:24 <earthy> the writing thing, yeah, think so
01:12:48 <earthy> even though I routinely keep my Strunk&White at hand when writing larger texts
01:15:10 <bring> ok, they let me register and by it for SEK 0 + VAT
01:15:34 <bring> VAT is 25 % here and 25 & of 0 is about 0, I figure
01:15:48 <bring> s/25 &/25 %/
01:16:44 <bring> I think they will do a credit check before I get the PDF, to see that I really have SEK 0
01:16:58 * earthy laughs
01:19:36 <bring> hmm, the albanian standards body seems to sell ISO standards too, maybe I should call them
01:20:02 <bring> exchange rate might be beneficial
01:21:55 <bring> earthy: thanks for the tip, it seems every country's standards organization carries the english version and their own translated one
02:14:32 <bring> is 12:00 AM noon or midnight?
02:15:05 <bring> hmm, great, NIST says "This is a tricky question."
02:15:08 <saz> midnight
02:15:17 <saz> i would have thought..
02:15:28 <kosmikus> that's what I think, too
02:15:43 <saz> but there's a reason we use the words noon and midnight
02:15:43 <Heffalump> it's neither
02:15:46 <Heffalump> it doesn't exist
02:15:58 <Heffalump> it's like asking if 0 is positive or negative
02:16:13 <Heffalump> in practice, people often use 12AM for midnight and 12PM for noon.
02:16:24 <Heffalump> but that's really silly, when you actually think about it
02:16:29 <kosmikus> it might not exist, but it's not comparable to the situation of 0
02:16:42 <Heffalump> since it means we go 12 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 11 in each of AM and PM
02:16:45 <Heffalump> why not?
02:16:54 <bring> that sure makes date parsing fun
02:16:55 <kosmikus> you decide to encode 24 hours by a number from 1 to 12 and a bit
02:17:16 <kosmikus> that the two values of the bit are called AM and PM, is completely irrelevant
02:17:41 <kosmikus> you just have to define the translation somehow
02:18:01 <bring> so basically 12 = 0, and am means add 0 hours, pm means add 12 hours
02:18:05 <Heffalump> The situation with noon definitely is comparable.
02:18:19 <Heffalump> Since "AM" means "ante meridien" and "PM" means "post meridien"
02:18:28 <Heffalump> possibly spelt more accurately than that
02:18:52 <bring> so is noon before or after noon?
02:19:04 <Heffalump> well, exactly :-)
02:19:10 <bring> http://www.boulder.nist.gov/timefreq/general/misc.htm
02:19:10 <Jerub> Heffalump: 12AM makes sense as midnight, becuase 12AM + epsilon is after midnight.
02:19:37 <kosmikus> but that's a problem of the labelling
02:19:49 <Heffalump> but 12AM-epsilon is before midnight
02:19:55 <kosmikus> what you're essentially admitting is that the 12 hour system is inferior because you cannot disambiguate 12
02:20:03 <bring> but 11:59 pm + 1 min = 12:00 am seems weird, guess that's an artifact of 12 = 0 though
02:20:38 <bring> if 0 was used instead of 12 it'd all be clear I think
02:20:41 <Heffalump> kosmikus: it's only (directly) a labelling problem if we accept your view of the world that they are just labels for that bit, rather than descriptive annotations intended for human use
02:21:24 <kosmikus> I've seen no watch yet that does not use AM or PM to disambiguate 12:00, too
02:21:30 <Jerub> Heffalump: yes! but that is represented as 11:XX:YY usually ;)
02:21:40 <Heffalump> jerub: true :-)
02:21:54 <bring> I guess the lesson here is that it's at least not crystal clar what it means, and should be avoided is possibl
02:22:02 <bring> eh, if possible
02:22:07 <Heffalump> kosmikus: well, have you ever looked at a watch at exactly midnight?
02:22:12 <kosmikus> yes
02:22:16 <Heffalump> I don't believe you.
02:22:20 <Jerub> Heffalump: it would make no sense to call 12:00:00 PM but 12:00:00.01 AM. thus 'midnight' is 12AM
02:22:22 <Heffalump> (I claim time is discrete :-)
02:22:25 <kosmikus> for exactly that reason, btw
02:22:48 <kosmikus> because I wanted to know what happens with the little PM or AM at that point in time
02:23:07 <Heffalump> you have no way of knowing that for the exact instant of midnight, it didn't do something descriptive like sprouting green fluffy ears
02:23:18 <Heffalump> and obviously once that instant had passed, AM was entirely correct
02:23:25 <bring> Jerub: I agree, but still makes 11:59:59 pm -> 12:00:00 am seem a little strange
02:23:41 <bring> Heffalump: haha
02:23:55 <kosmikus> it was a digital clock, and is only accurate to the second
02:24:09 <Heffalump> so what do you think it indicates when it says "12:00AM"?
02:24:23 <Heffalump> or rather, what is the correct way to interpret that?
02:24:38 <kosmikus> as the same as 0:00
02:24:57 <Heffalump> but what range of times might it be when it says that, assuming that it's accurate?
02:25:16 <Heffalump> and for what proportion of that range is AM even possibly not correct?
02:25:42 <kosmikus> it's possibly not correct for a zero-set of that range
02:26:13 <bring> I'll just go with 12:00 AM === 00:00, because that's easier to code :)
02:26:28 <Heffalump> define a zero-set?
02:26:56 <Heffalump> and how do you know that it didn't sprout green fluffy years for the instant of midnight? (Apart from the physical impossibility of doing that in an instant)
02:27:02 <Heffalump> s/years/ears/
02:27:06 <kosmikus> The Lebesgue measure of the set is zero.
02:27:11 <bring> I say we should switch to decimal time, get rid of this nonsense once and for all
02:27:42 <Heffalump> absolutely
02:27:57 <Heffalump> (or just have the strange bits of the world that don't use it switch to 24 hour time)
02:29:06 <Heffalump> kosmikus: I think you meant "null set", btw.
02:30:08 <Jerub> @000 !
02:30:26 <bring> "Not only are the trains now running on time, they?re running on metric time!  Remember this moment, people:  80 past 2 on April 47th!"
02:30:32 <Jerub> its actually @477, but you get that.
02:30:37 <kosmikus> Heffalump: might be a language problem
02:30:54 <Heffalump> well, I didn't actually know either term, I had to google :-)
02:33:20 <kosmikus> seems to used incorrectly a lot, though
02:39:01 <bring> I think I've gotten the (almost) inverse of formatCalendarTime work except for week numbers, doing that next
02:39:24 <bring> oh, and seconds since epoch
02:39:41 <bring> but that's actually broken in the standard libraries
02:40:23 <bring> in formatCalendarTime that is
02:44:45 <Lunar^> bring: Broken in which way ?
02:57:21 <bring> Lunar^: it shows the number of seconds since midnight, not the epoch :)
02:57:48 <bring> it's listed as a ToDo
02:58:55 <bring> ISO 8601 week numbers are a little odd, they are numbered 1-53, and week 1 is the first week that contains a thrusday
02:59:25 <amgine2> hi all is there an module to convert a string to ascii in haskell ?
02:59:31 <bring> so week 1 of year X can start in december year (X-1)
03:00:18 <bring> amgine2: *Main> fromEnum 'a'
03:00:18 <bring> 97
03:00:18 <bring> *Main> map fromEnum "foo"
03:00:18 <bring> [102,111,111]
03:00:59 <amgine2> i see
03:01:22 <amgine2> how about a number to binary ?
03:01:33 <bring> or you can use ord from Data.Char to do Char -> Int
03:02:41 <amgine2> typical ascii is represented by 7bits right ?
03:03:19 <tic> yeah.
03:03:25 <tic> Â‰ˆ's not, though.
03:03:35 <amgine2> yeah that's enough
03:04:00 <amgine2> does haskell have a module to convert a number to n bits ?
03:04:44 <bring> amgine2: have a look at showIntAtBase in the Numeric module
03:05:07 <amgine2> thanks that's cool
03:05:34 <bring> Prelude Numeric> (showIntAtBase 2 (['0','1']!!) 38) ""
03:05:34 <bring> "100110"
03:05:50 <amgine2> hmmm
03:05:58 <bring> some superfluous parantheses there
03:06:11 <amgine2> i'm reading the docs now
03:08:27 <bring> amgine2: my last example was to convert to binary, not fixed-width binary, didn't see that you wanted that
03:08:44 <amgine2> hmmm
03:10:04 <amgine2> i'm just gonna make a function
03:10:06 <amgine2> not to hard
03:10:12 <amgine2> wanted to see if haskell had something build in
03:13:03 <Heffalump> 'lo Smerdyakov
03:24:07 <amgine2> why is this  
03:24:07 <amgine2> toInt :: Int -> [Char] -> Int -> Int 
03:24:07 <amgine2> toInt 0 _ result = result 
03:24:07 <amgine2> toInt base (b:rest) result = toInt (base-1) rest (result+((read b::String)*2^base))
03:24:12 <amgine2> not working
03:24:14 <amgine2> and gives this
03:24:23 <amgine2> Couldn't match `String' against `Char' 
03:24:23 <amgine2>     Expected type: String 
03:24:23 <amgine2>     Inferred type: Char 
03:24:23 <amgine2> In the first argument of `read', namely `b' 
03:24:23 <amgine2> When checking the type signature of the expression: 
03:24:24 <amgine2>       read b :: String 
03:24:26 <amgine2> ed, modules loaded: none.
03:28:06 <kosmikus> because b is a Char, and not a String
03:28:46 <amgine2> i thought read can work with char
03:28:56 <amgine2> show 'a'
03:29:01 <amgine2> crap wrong window
03:29:20 <amgine2> how to conver a char to int ?
03:31:31 <bring> '1' => 1 or '1' => 49
03:32:03 <kosmikus> turn the Char into a String, then apply read, as you do
03:32:32 <amgine2> i see
03:41:18 <amgine2> how to convert a number into a char ?
03:41:34 <Heffalump> DYM ASCII-style?
03:41:45 <amgine2> brb
03:42:12 <amgine2> yeah
03:42:20 <Heffalump> chr and ord
03:42:26 <amgine2> ohhhc rap
03:42:29 <amgine2> i forgat about those
03:42:30 <amgine2> thanks
03:42:51 <amgine2> crap
03:45:20 <bring> <Lunar^> bring: I want a gregorian calendar implementation ! ;)
03:46:25 <bring> what exactly do you need, just wrote a dayOfWeek :: Day -> Month -> Year -> DayOfWeek (pseudo type :) )
03:48:58 <bring> *Main> dayOfWeek 23 03 2004
03:48:58 <bring> Tuesday
04:05:31 <Lunar^> bring: System.Time uses mktime() which is a *nix call
04:06:12 <Lunar^> bring: This is not hOp friendly :)
04:10:13 <earthy> still, what do you need?
04:13:05 <Lunar^> something like mktime() or java.util.GregorianCalendar
04:13:44 <Lunar^> But this needs a design choice, because locale related variations happens a lot with date manipulation
04:14:33 <Lunar^> e.g. I discovered that to know if a year is a leap year you have to know the current locale (because the switch between julian calendar and gregorian calendar is locale dependant)
04:14:46 * earthy nods
04:15:18 <earthy> and if you want to be hour-correct it's worse
04:15:29 <earthy> given dst and shite like that
04:15:40 <Lunar^> GNU Classpath has a quite good implementation at first sight
04:15:54 <Lunar^> But getting locale information is state dependant
04:16:14 <Lunar^> Should every time manipulation constrained in this IO monad ? I don't like that
04:26:40 <earthy> ah, no, you parameterize time manipulation functions with TZ
04:27:01 <earthy> and provide defaults that approximate through using UTC
04:29:07 <Lunar^> Let's do that :)
04:29:28 <Lunar^> That's some amount of work though... time time time...
04:29:41 <earthy> ;)
04:30:30 <phubuh> er, what happened to darcs send?
04:30:35 <phubuh> $ darcs send
04:30:35 <phubuh> Invalid command 'send'!
04:30:45 <Heffalump> has it been released yet?
04:30:47 <kosmikus> phubuh: old version?
04:30:48 <phubuh> and indeed, it's not in the list of commands in darcs 0.9.17
04:31:03 <kosmikus> it's only in the repository versions as of now
04:31:06 <Heffalump> I thought it was just planned, not yet in a released version.
04:31:07 <Heffalump> yeah.
04:31:12 <phubuh> oh.
04:31:25 <kosmikus> use push instead
04:31:52 <phubuh> okay, thanks
05:56:33 <shapr> Lunar^: could you use TAO or whatever the 'real' time thingy is?
05:56:56 <shapr> Lunar^: then you'd only have to worry about converting BIOS time to TAO, and TAO back to BIOS time
05:57:08 <shapr> and people who want Gregorian dates can just write their own library
05:57:12 <Lunar^> shapr: Sure, that's what a gregorian calndar is for
05:57:32 <shapr> ah, I just passed 19k spams
05:57:34 <Lunar^> shapr: BIOS -> TOD (seconds since EPOCH) needs a gregorian calendar
05:57:57 <shapr> couldn't you write a limited gregorian that only deals with time since the epoch?
05:58:21 <Lunar^> I prefer writing the whole thing, we need it anyway
05:58:22 <shapr> from the discussion on the libraries mailing list, I got the impression that TAO was the best system allaround
05:58:25 <shapr> ok
05:58:28 <Lunar^> TAO ?
05:59:55 <shapr> I've forgotten what it stands for
06:00:12 * shapr looks
06:04:03 * shapr boings
06:06:00 <Si> shapr, are you busy?
06:20:21 <liiwi> shapr: only 19k? I'm only about wave of mouse and four keystrokes away from sending you about 25k.
06:21:00 <liiwi> it's sooo small thing to do that it's pulling me like gravity :)
06:25:02 <shapr> Si: somewhat, but I have a short amount of time
06:25:14 <shapr> liiwi: um, what's 19k?
06:28:44 <shapr> Si: what's up?
06:29:14 <shapr> ahem
06:29:25 <shapr> liiwi: please no, I'm fine with my poor little piddly 19k
06:29:55 * shapr wonders who would send him a 25gb email
06:30:14 * shapr looks nervously at liiwi 
06:31:21 <shapr> any i18n people around? I'm ineffectually trying to bend gettext to my will
06:32:50 <Igloo> Bah, LaTeX doesn't have enough <= symbols
06:32:54 <shapr> g'day Ninja Jones
06:33:07 <SyntaxNinja> hihi shapr
06:33:09 <Si> it doesn't matter if you're busy, I've got a prerelease version of the HAIFA Client
06:33:13 <shapr> w00!
06:33:15 <shapr> want want!
06:35:06 <Si> I've provided a demo using Google Web-Service, but the only catch is you have to compile my slightly modified version of HXT first
06:35:19 <Si> and it only works with GHCi atm
06:35:56 <shapr> is it something I can hack into a working version?
06:36:29 <shapr> as in, do I have to sign an NDA first? :-)
06:36:36 <Si> course not
06:36:57 <Si> but I can't accept patches into the main tree while June
06:37:19 <Si> and you need to give me feedback, those are the only prequisites
06:37:26 <shapr> fair enough
06:37:59 <Heffalump> HAIFA?
06:38:30 <Si> And there isn't a lot of documentation atm, but so long as you use the auto marshaller, it should be easy (if tedious) to create client
06:38:57 <Si> The Haskell Advanced Interoperation Framework Architecture
06:39:06 <shapr> as long as you don't mind me exploiting my knowledge of your email address to ask you questions
06:39:32 <Si> of course I don't
06:39:48 <shapr> excellent, where do I get my first free dose? :-)
06:40:01 <Si> I'd have set up a website for it and written some decent docs if I had time, but I need to get on and write HAC
06:40:12 <shapr> fine with me, I prefer code over docs
06:40:26 <Si> when I get home, but it may take a little time
06:41:00 <shapr> no worries, I doubt I'll have much time left over today
06:41:01 <Si> HAIFA/SOAP itself is dead easy to work with, but HXT has to be manually installed
06:41:21 <shapr> I've worked with HXT a bit, even got paid for it :-)
06:41:54 <Si> good, I built it into a package because it made my life easier and made a few small alterations
06:42:06 <shapr> you should probably pass the alterations back to Uwe Schmidt
06:42:12 <Si> I will when I have time
06:42:34 <shapr> I wrote up the first version of the HUnit tests that come with HXT and sent them back, that's how the HXT unit tests got started.
06:42:47 <Si> there's only 5 weeks left till handin
06:42:49 * shapr wonders if his name shows up in the credits anywhere
06:42:53 <shapr> right, code first
06:43:04 <Si> in that time I have to write HAC and a WSDL parser/builder
06:43:12 <shapr> I'm sure you can do it.
06:43:16 <Si> and write 60 pages of pure genious
06:43:29 <Si> (note the spelling)
06:43:46 <shapr> are the 60 pages the report?
06:43:49 <Si> yes
06:43:52 <shapr> @all-dicts genious
06:43:53 <lambdabot> No match for "genious".
06:44:09 <Si> I was being silly, genious isn't a word :)
06:44:15 <shapr> I thought so
06:44:20 <shapr> just checking
06:45:01 <Si> fortunately I do have a decent spell checker, anyway I must head home, when I get there I'll package up the demo for you
06:45:12 <shapr> spiffy, I look forward to it
06:45:16 <Si> well it's hardly a demo, but you know what I mean
06:45:23 <shapr> right I understand
06:45:30 <shapr> I'm dying to get my hands on a working SOAP client in Haskell
06:45:40 <Lunar^> shapr: No please, stay alive :)
06:45:43 <shapr> once I'm done with the haskell mailing list search app
06:45:44 <shapr> Lunar^: :-P
06:45:54 <Si> ok, I'll explain the gotchas when I get home
06:45:58 <shapr> then I'm going to hack up a @google lambdabot plugin
06:46:04 <Si> l8rs
06:46:07 <shapr> ok
06:46:08 <shapr> cya
06:46:22 * shapr grins
06:50:08 <SyntaxNinja> I sometimes print latex documents that I write just because latex is so pretty.
06:50:19 <SyntaxNinja> not because I actually need them printed out
06:56:45 <shapr> yah, latex is gorgeous
06:56:54 <shapr> I feel sorry for ms.doc users sometimes.
06:56:58 <shapr> they have to deal with consumer pap
06:58:34 <CrewdenX> consumer what?
06:58:57 <CrewdenX> :q
06:59:00 <CrewdenX> ack.

07:05:09 <cm> hiho :)
07:06:28 <CrewdenX> poor ms users with their intestinal disorders. =(
07:06:43 <CrewdenX> and their nipples.
07:07:42 <CrewdenX> and their eating through a straw.
07:07:52 <CrewdenX> heh, actually this is the perfect word isn't it? =)
07:08:00 <shapr> yes, it is
07:08:04 <shapr> consumer pap
07:08:22 <shapr> english has some really cool words
07:36:13 <shapr> aw, I didn't see pesco
07:36:29 * shapr looks around for other people he hasn't said hi to recently
07:36:32 <shapr> rubix: bonjour!
07:36:48 <shapr> seafood_: g'day!
07:36:56 <shapr> eivuokko: hyv√§√§ huomenta!
07:36:59 <rubix> shapr, salut !
07:37:04 * shapr boings
07:37:34 <shapr> rubix: any further development with your go program lately?
07:37:57 <rubix> shapr, well, not at all
07:38:03 <shapr> ok, just wondering
07:38:40 <rubix> but one day, when I will have a lot of time... well, if that day actually happens... I'll do it
07:38:51 <shapr> neat
07:39:16 <rubix> shapr, what's new about haskell ?
07:39:35 <shapr> well, HAIFA is sort of like J2EE or Zope for Haskell
07:39:42 <rubix> haifa ?
07:39:57 <shapr> bring, viblo, forester, mardie, et al are continuing development with HaskellDB
07:40:18 <Lunar^> rubix: hOp hOp hOp :)
07:40:32 <shapr> Lunar^ is doing cool stuff with hOp :-)
07:40:36 <rubix> Lunar^, ah, alors, Áa avance hOp ?
07:40:48 <Lunar^> rubix: Tu lis pas le dev lOg ?
07:40:57 <shapr> http://etudiants.insia.org/~jbobbio/hOp/
07:41:08 <rubix> pas lu rÈcemment, non
07:41:28 <Marvin--> stop that you bleedin' feregners :)
07:41:37 <shapr> varf√∂r? ;-)
07:41:52 <earthy> arret quoi?
07:42:08 <rubix> looks like I have a lot to read about hOp
07:42:11 * Marvin-- goes to refactor some code instead
07:42:15 <earthy> (m'excuse mon francais :))
07:42:25 <shapr> I gave up using an on-disk database for the haskell email searching tool, and am nearly done with the part that loads emails into postgresql (using HaskellDB and WASHMail)
07:42:41 <Lunar^> shapr: Cool :)
07:42:57 <Lunar^> shapr: Will it work together with your spam filter ?
07:42:58 <shapr> the not-done part is that I expected all the message-id fields to be unique
07:43:05 <shapr> it could
07:43:07 <shapr> I hadn't thought of that
07:44:00 <shapr> anyways, once I've worked around the non-unique message-id fields problem, I'll write a WASH search that calls HaskellDB
07:44:02 <rubix> an email searching tool ? what functionalities does it provide that doesn't exist in my mail client, for example ?
07:44:23 <shapr> it takes the mailman archives as input
07:44:34 <shapr> so it'll let you search all of the haskell mailing lists that have used mailman
07:45:04 <Smerdyakov> Sounds dubious that this is new functionality.
07:45:06 <shapr> I don't remember when they started using mailmain, 98? 95? something like that.
07:45:20 <Lunar^> shapr: How do IMAP server works then ?
07:45:29 <Lunar^> (if message-id are non-unique)
07:45:36 <shapr> I don't know
07:45:47 <shapr> I just didn't expect duplicate message-ids in the mbox files
07:45:53 <Lunar^> shapr: Maybe that could be interesting to look
07:46:15 <shapr> it looks like the problem has to do with the yale.edu mailservers
07:46:44 <shapr> anyways, I've been looking for something fun to write that uses HaskellDB and WASH
07:47:22 <shapr> there have been a number of complaints on the haskell mailing lists that the archives are not searchable
07:47:30 <shapr> so I know people will want to use this tool
07:47:41 <shapr> I know I'll use it even if no one else does, so that's enough for me
07:48:35 <shapr> I think I'll use the same functionality to setup searching for the #haskell logs
07:48:35 <rubix> it looks like a nice idea
07:48:41 <shapr> :-)
08:02:03 <rubix> aaargl, no, no, no. I must stop reading webpages about haskell and go back to work now.
08:07:55 * Marvin-- ponders where to find Patrik Jansson's paper on chasing bottom
08:08:10 <Smerdyakov> Now there's a funny name for a topic.
08:09:18 <Marvin--> :)
08:15:48 <SyntaxNinja> Marvin--: you're chasing his paper on chasing bottom.
08:19:45 * adept . o O (so bottom chase seems to be transitive)
08:22:00 <SyntaxNinja> adept: we all knew that.
08:22:46 <adept> It's is always good when abstract concepts have such an intuitive explanation by example from real life ;)
08:22:59 <Marvin--> indeed
08:23:22 <SyntaxNinja> hehe
09:37:11 <Marvin--> Koen thinks my report is approaching some sort of finished state :)
09:40:42 <kosmikus> Marvin--: great -- I wish I could say the same ...
09:42:19 <Marvin--> if I can get there, anyone can ;)
09:42:45 * Marvin-- just wishes he'd had a shot at those PhD positions
09:45:12 <kosmikus> why didn't you?
09:46:09 <Marvin--> oh I applied all right
09:46:24 <Marvin--> they just don't seem to be interested in me
09:46:57 <kosmikus> that's sad
09:47:02 <kosmikus> so they did not even invite you?
09:49:45 <Marvin--> well, with 180 applicants and funding for two positions...
09:50:08 <Marvin--> I'm told I made "top 24" at least
09:51:09 <Marvin--> but it feels kinda unfair, many of the people called to interview have project employments at the institution, most of them already have publications
09:51:36 <Marvin--> oh well, guess I should start worrying about what to do with my life now instead ;)
09:52:11 <Igloo> Have you thought of applying elsewhere?
09:52:22 <Marvin--> sure
09:53:26 <kosmikus> yes, do that
09:53:28 <kosmikus> use the chance
09:53:33 <kosmikus> go somewhere else
09:54:33 <Marvin--> don't know where to start, though
09:54:41 <Marvin--> actually, yes I do, finish this report ;)
09:55:24 <Marvin--> so I can send a copy of my thesis rather than a half-assed draft
09:55:54 <kosmikus> hmm, is it common practice to send the thesis along with an application?
09:56:12 <Smerdyakov> Marvin--, why is it unfair for other applicants to have publications?
09:56:13 <Marvin--> no idea
09:56:39 <Smerdyakov> kosmikus, no, since (at least in the USA) PhD programs will look down on applicants who already have Master degrees.
09:57:04 <Smerdyakov> kosmikus, maybe an undergrad thesis.... though maybe what you mean by Masters in Europe is what we would think of as an undergrad senior thesis here!
09:57:50 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: it's not unfair for other applicants to have publications, it feels unfair that I've never gotten the opportunity even though my degree project is highly relevant for a newly started research project here, and that you basically have to have publications to be able to get a PhD position
09:57:56 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: huh, interesting
09:58:08 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: and anyhoo, it's very undefined and non-standardized here in Europe
09:58:29 <Marvin--> all that Chalmers say is to "attach copies of publications or other relevant work" or something such
09:58:33 <Smerdyakov> Marvin--, well, apply to US universities. It's very consistent. :D
09:59:17 <monotonom> US universities are not very interesting.
09:59:25 <kosmikus> at least I have never heard of anyone submitting his thesis with a PhD application (in Europe)
09:59:34 <Smerdyakov> monotonom, I do not agree. I am very interested in mine. :)
09:59:58 <Marvin--> I would say that Sweden's "kandidatexamen" is roughly like a bachelor and that "magisterexamen" is somewhere in between bachelor and master
10:00:32 <Smerdyakov> Magister Ludi!
10:00:39 <Marvin--> kosmikus: well, I wouldn't know
10:01:30 <kosmikus> Smerdyakov: I cannot say anything about the comparability of theses between US and Europe, because I've never been to the US
10:02:31 <Marvin--> the reason I've only applied to Chalmers so far is that I knew of the fixed deadline, I have a lot of contacts at the institution and I *know* they do stuff I'm interested in (like Haskell stuff...)
10:02:51 <Smerdyakov> Marvin--, how is FP research funded in Europe?
10:03:07 <kosmikus> Marvin--: probably, a good way would be to ask Koen if he has any ideas where you might go ...
10:03:35 <Marvin--> Smerdyakov: no idea
10:03:51 <Marvin--> kosmikus: yeah
10:04:23 <Smerdyakov> Marvin--, that seems like something that would be good to know, if you don't want to end up out on the street eating rats.
10:04:31 <Marvin--> :P
10:05:23 <Smerdyakov> Can anyone remind me what you can conclude from a linear system of equalities where the matrix for the system is singular?
10:05:33 <kosmikus> Smerdyakov: there's no general answer to the funding question. mostly by the universities themselves or by the governments, I would guess. 
10:05:59 <Smerdyakov> kosmikus, hm. I don't think any universities here pay for research to any great degree.
10:06:19 <Smerdyakov> kosmikus, they'll just organize use of grants from government or industry.
10:08:00 <kosmikus> most universities I know of are themselves government-funded, and they can assign money to projects up to a limited amount; the rest is funded by the government directly, or by industry
10:08:21 <kosmikus> I don't know of any directly fp-related, industry-funded research projects in the NL, though
10:08:28 <Smerdyakov> Interesting. I'm not familiar with anything like that in the USA.
10:08:37 <Marvin--> right, that's more or less my impression too
10:08:39 <Smerdyakov> Grants are tagged with which project they belong to.
10:09:43 <Marvin--> projects apply for grants from government bodies and stuff, how industry funding works I don't know
10:09:56 <Marvin--> I don't think that you have to overly worry about it as a *PhD student* though
10:10:12 <Smerdyakov> In the USA, funding is a major issue for PhD students.
10:10:20 <Marvin--> interesting
10:10:21 <Smerdyakov> People make their school choices based on who offers what funding.
10:11:19 <Smerdyakov> It can be the difference between actually finishing in a reasonable amount of time and needing to be a teaching assistant every semester of your grad career.
10:11:25 <Marvin--> in Sweden, if you get a PhD student position, that means you're funded for four years and you spend part of your time (~20%) working for the institution (like teaching)
10:11:49 <Marvin--> dunno about the rest of Europe
10:12:01 <Smerdyakov> In the USA, things are generally very different.
10:12:08 <Smerdyakov> You'll be required to teach once or twice.
10:12:14 <Marvin--> I mean, theoretically you can finish a PhD without having such an employment but it's very very rare
10:12:17 <Smerdyakov> Beyond that, you arrange your own funding, which might include teaching more,.
10:12:38 <Marvin--> sounds like a pain
10:12:55 <Smerdyakov> No, it's not a pain if you go to a top university with good faculty attracting lots of money.
10:13:09 <Marvin--> I guess
10:13:12 <Smerdyakov> You can avoid the more altruistic kinds of service in favor of working on your thesis.
10:13:41 <Smerdyakov> There are also some national fellowships that will pay for you to do whatever you want for 3 years.
10:13:51 <Smerdyakov> I'll find out in about a week if I got one. :)
10:14:10 <Marvin--> :)
10:14:28 <kosmikus> have to leave ...
10:14:33 <Marvin--> so how do I go about applying? ;)
10:14:38 <Marvin--> see ya kosm
10:14:47 <Smerdyakov> It's easy! Go back in time and become a US citizen! :D
10:15:07 <Marvin--> oooh
10:15:19 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: you're giving him too much information. beware the thought police.
10:17:21 <SyntaxNinja> but I'm not exactly sure what Smerdyakov means. I've met lots of non-US citizens who are graduate students.
10:18:13 <Smerdyakov> Yup, but none of them have NSF or NDSEG fellowships.
10:29:07 <shapr> Yampa is BSD now, yay!
10:29:57 <SyntaxNinja> :)
10:45:10 <Si\> shapr, you wanna have a go at installing the client?
10:51:50 <shapr> sure
10:53:23 <Si\> Ok it's in the post
10:53:27 <shapr> yay
10:54:10 <Si\> well kinda, my SMTP server is a little slow...
10:54:49 <shapr> you could use sendfile/saft
10:55:25 <Si\> what are either of those?
10:55:44 <shapr> if you have debian, apt-get install sendfile
10:56:10 <shapr> SAFT == simple async file transfer
10:56:11 <Si\> if you have gentoo emerge sendfile :)
10:56:16 <shapr> sounds good
10:56:26 <Si\> as it happens I reckon the email will have reached you now
10:57:06 <shapr> yup
10:57:29 <Si\> ok, now there are two files there, first we'll focus our attention on the HXT archive
10:58:17 * shapr opens the archives
10:58:18 <Si\> the most important thing is that you run make in the http directory first before running make in the root directory
10:58:33 <shapr> ok
10:59:05 <Si\> for the life of me I can't remember why, but it doesn't work otherwise
10:59:27 <shapr> huh, it includes parsec
10:59:32 <shapr> greetz stepcut, wassup?
10:59:40 <Si\> yes, but a modified version
10:59:58 <shapr> okej, om du sager
10:59:59 <shapr> er
10:59:59 <Si\> if u try it with the parsec in GHC (and I have) it won't parse anything
11:00:14 * shapr is starting to think in swedish
11:00:29 <stepcut> shapr: trying to figure out how to parse binary data from a network connection
11:00:32 * Si\ thinks in gibberish
11:00:44 <shapr> stepcut: already looked at Tomasz' sources?
11:01:05 <stepcut> shapr: is that the deser stuff, or something different?
11:01:09 <shapr> yup, deser
11:02:13 <stepcut> shapr: yeah, I think that will work, because I don't think I need the choice operator...
11:02:33 <stepcut> shapr: but my current problem is more fundamental... 
11:02:42 <shapr> ?
11:03:53 <shapr> ok, hxt is built
11:04:02 * stepcut ponders how to explain the problem...
11:04:36 <Si\> right
11:04:45 <Si\> run make hpackge in the root dir
11:04:56 <stepcut> shapr: so I am trying to implement a simple AIM library. So basically, I want to open a connection to the AIM server, and then there will be a bunch of chatter back and forth
11:05:22 <shapr> Si\: is it sposed to complain about popen?
11:05:34 <Si\> no, what did it say?
11:06:06 <shapr> find: popen: No such file or directory
11:06:31 <shapr> looks like line 266 of Makefile
11:06:39 <shapr> stepcut: sounds okay so far
11:06:58 <stepcut> shapr: But how do I get the right amount of data from the handle? Unlike a file, where all the data is present when you open the file, a network connection maybe not have all the data there yet...
11:07:33 <Si\> did it make ok though?
11:07:37 <stepcut> shapr: So I am trying to figure out if I can use hGetContents on a network connection, or not...
11:07:56 <shapr> you could use 6.2.1 with -threaded-rts and run a blocking read on the socket in another thread
11:08:02 <shapr> how about that?
11:08:17 <shapr> Si\: seems so
11:08:26 <Si\> try make hpackage
11:08:37 <shapr> it runs ar and ld
11:08:40 <shapr> so I assume it's okay
11:08:47 <stepcut> shapr: yeah, I was thinking about doing something like that, but first I wanted to see if I could do it without threads 
11:09:09 <stepcut> shapr: maybe using arrows and stream processors or something
11:09:23 <Si\> ok, now you need to create a directory to house hxt, something like /usr/local/lib/hxt (that's what I use)
11:10:09 <shapr> ok
11:10:18 <Si\> and copy the HShxt.o and libHShxt.a to it
11:10:56 <Si\> and then create a directory called imports, and copy all the .hi files from all the directories (hdom, hparser etc.) to it
11:11:03 <stepcut> shapr: but even if I make a seperate thread, how do I get that data into my parser? Would the thread somehow return a lazy String (I have never done threads in haskell)
11:11:55 <shapr> stepcut: all your thread questions will be answered by reading the Concurrent paper linked from Control.Concurrent haddocks
11:12:19 <stepcut> shapr: excellent.
11:12:26 <shapr> Si\: /usr/local/lib/hxt/imports ?
11:12:33 <Si\> yes
11:12:35 <shapr> ok
11:12:59 <stepcut> shapr: I know people have solved this problem, I just haven't found the right places to look yet ;)
11:13:16 <shapr> Concurrent is a good thing to know about
11:13:32 <Si\> then you edit hxt-package.conf and set the directories to what you've stored your stuff in
11:13:40 <Si\> and finally run ghc-pkg on the conf file
11:14:17 <Si\> it should be possible to do all that with make install, but I'm no good at autoconf/automake :(
11:14:44 <shapr> ghc-pkg -a hxt-package.conf right?
11:14:50 <Si\> ah hah
11:14:59 <shapr> oh, -i
11:15:07 <shapr> hmm
11:16:18 <shapr> ohh, I bet I need to point it to my config file
11:17:36 <shapr> oh, -a -i hxt-package.conf
11:17:41 <shapr> ok, now what?
11:18:21 <Si\> extract the haifa client
11:18:26 <shapr> ok
11:19:09 <shapr> ?
11:19:33 <Si\> cd to the Examples directory and run ghci GoogleSearch.hs
11:20:01 <shapr> where's the assocList?
11:20:11 <Si\> in HXT
11:20:19 <shapr> hm, doesn't seem to find it
11:20:48 <Si\> Looks like it didn't compile right, when did it throw up the error about POpen?
11:21:04 <Si\> oh simple fix, create an empty directory called popen
11:21:34 <Si\> no forget that
11:21:59 <Si\> it does throw up and error about popen, but nothings wrong, did it load package hxt?
11:23:47 <shapr> yup
11:24:25 <Si\> check /usr/local/lib/hxt/imports for AssocList.hi
11:24:59 <shapr> yup, it's there
11:25:34 <shapr> it's complaining about AssocList.AssocList
11:26:24 <Si\> yes it will, it's first in the Alphabet so first it looks for
11:26:37 <Si\> my guess is it isn't finding any of the imports
11:27:06 <Si\> have a look at /usr/lib/ghc-6.x/packages.conf
11:27:19 <Si\> or package.conf rather
11:27:24 <shapr> it's in there
11:27:28 <shapr> ghc -v shows hxt
11:28:22 * Marvin-- fiddles with his show monad
11:28:38 <Si\> is the imports directory in package.conf the same as the the place you put all the .hi
11:28:45 <shapr> yup
11:29:01 <shapr> I think you're right, it's not finding the .hi files, but I don't understand why
11:29:41 <shapr> huh, weirdness
11:29:46 <shapr> if I do :m + AssocList
11:29:49 <shapr> then it finds that one
11:29:52 <Marvin--> this is *so* much nicer than showString foo . showString bar into eternity
11:30:05 <shapr> and trying to load GoogleSearch.hs again doesn't give that error, it gives another
11:31:42 <Si\> do ls | wc -l in /usr/local/lib/hxt/imports for me will you please
11:33:07 <Si\> you should get 43
11:33:18 <shapr> I get 60
11:33:34 <Si\> oh yes, you'll have copied the hunit stuff over as well
11:33:49 <shapr> you said get all the *.hi files, I did cp HXT/**/*.hi 
11:34:39 <shapr> http://shapr.homelinux.net/~shae/hifiles
11:34:44 <Si\> I know I did, it was just easier than not to specify hunit
11:34:52 <Si\> it won't make any difference though
11:35:09 <shapr> yah, I seriously doubt this is an error on your part
11:35:16 <shapr> but I would like to know what's going on
11:35:30 <Si\> I'm just recompiling HXT myself
11:35:41 <Si\> with the same source tree
11:36:39 <shapr> everything looks sane enough
11:37:02 <Si\> no, I used the same tree and it worked
11:37:09 <Si\> what version of GHC are you using?
11:37:58 <shapr> interesting, http://shapr.homelinux.net/~shae/ghcerror
11:38:55 <shapr> so, why would GHCi complain, but ghc wouldn't?
11:39:01 <shapr> oh wait
11:39:19 <shapr> I didn't use the "auto-build ghci libs" option when installing with ghc-pkg
11:39:22 <shapr> maybe that's it?
11:39:26 * Marvin-- once again tries to understand callCC
11:41:51 <shapr> Si\: I'm using 6.2
11:42:01 <Si\> so am I
11:42:09 <shapr> are you using hierarchical libs?
11:42:14 <Si\> yes
11:42:50 <Si\> try this;
11:42:55 <Si\> ghci -package hxt
11:43:01 <Si\> :b HdomParser
11:43:14 <shapr> that gives me the error
11:43:33 <shapr> oh, I might know the problem
11:43:35 <shapr> just a moment
11:44:13 <shapr> no :_/
11:44:18 <shapr> I thought it might be my ~/.ghci
11:45:41 <Si\> try ghci -i/usr/local/lib/hxt/imports -package hxt
11:46:17 <shapr> works by itself
11:46:26 <shapr> but if I add GoogleSearch.hs to the end, it gives the same error
11:46:40 <shapr> but :m + AssocList still works
11:47:00 <shapr> even after getting the error, I can do :m + AssocList in ghci
11:47:07 <Si\> then edit the .ghci and :set -i/usr/local/lib/hxt/imports above :set -package hxt
11:48:19 <shapr> Failed to find interface decl for `AssocList.AssocList'
11:48:19 <shapr> from module `AssocList'
11:49:03 <Si\> how big is HShxt.o
11:49:04 <shapr> I dunno, this is strange
11:49:23 <shapr> 3.7 mb
11:49:30 <Si\> same here
11:49:42 <Si\> and AssocList.hi?
11:49:45 <shapr> it's gotta be a path problem somewhere
11:49:55 <shapr> 4086 bytes
11:50:00 <Si\> same here
11:50:02 <Si\> exactly
11:50:29 <shapr> hm
11:51:42 <Si\> ok, well to test it you *can* do it this way; remove the :set -package hxt and in it's place add :set -i/path/to/hxt/hdom etc.
11:51:56 <shapr> actually, that doesn't work either
11:52:07 <shapr> then it can't find SOAPTransaction and friends
11:52:17 <shapr> and if I explicitly include those also
11:52:40 <shapr> when I've finally included enough, then it complains about duplicate instance declarations in a MonadIO someting in HXT
11:53:00 <shapr> I checked that file, there's only one instance declaration, so I think file is being loaded twice
11:53:17 <Si\> you don't have 2 instances of hxt or something do you?
11:53:18 <shapr> basically, something seriously weird is going on with the path
11:53:50 <shapr> I have another one in a very different part of the filesystem
11:53:53 <shapr> but it shouldn't be included at all
11:54:36 <Si\> and it wouldn't be called hxt anyway
11:54:41 <shapr> right
11:54:58 <shapr> there not another entry for HXmlToolbox in ghc-pkg
11:55:07 <shapr> only hxt and HaXML
11:55:12 <Si\> what error does it give you for MonadIO and HXT?
11:55:37 <shapr> Duplicate instance declarations:
11:55:37 <shapr>   In module MonadStateIO: GHC.Base.Monad (MonadStateIO.StateIO state)
11:55:37 <shapr>   In module MonadStateIO: GHC.Base.Monad (MonadStateIO.StateIO state)
11:56:09 <Si\> must be loading it twice
11:56:17 <shapr> yup
11:56:35 <shapr> like you originally suspected, it has to be a path problem
11:56:39 <Si\> try removing the entry for HXT from the package.conf
11:56:42 <shapr> I just have no idea what sort of path problem
11:56:43 <shapr> ok
11:57:41 <jdrake> this animation is good: http://www.oldos.org/flash/iconwar.swf
11:58:36 <Si\> now try loading again by including the HXT dirs manually
11:58:48 <shapr> doh
11:59:03 <shapr> I had -package hxt in the same command line with all the explicit include dirs
11:59:14 <shapr> without -package hxt it loads!
11:59:23 <Si\> excellent
11:59:26 <shapr> w00!
11:59:30 <Si\> try googleSearch "haskell"
11:59:50 <Si\> you should get a nasty error back from GOogle
12:00:21 <shapr> actually, it wants (Int, Int) as well
12:00:44 <Si\> doh
12:00:45 <Si\> sorry
12:00:52 <Si\> I added that recently
12:01:06 <Si\> its the start result and the number of results to return
12:01:13 <shapr> oh
12:01:15 <shapr> that's sensible
12:01:22 <shapr> very fp
12:01:24 <Si\> max of ten results
12:01:57 <shapr> it flipped out because of dupe symbols in RE.o
12:02:42 <shapr> hm
12:03:25 <shapr> GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
12:03:25 <shapr>    __stginit_RE
12:03:30 <shapr> then complains about hvalidator
12:04:59 <Si\> RE, that's part of parsec isn't it
12:05:05 <Si\> or is it
12:05:33 <shapr> I don't think so
12:05:41 <Si\> no, it's part of hvalidator
12:06:18 <Si\> it definately isn't looking at the /usr/local/lib/hxt or root directory of hxt src?
12:06:47 <shapr> it is looking at the root dir of hxt src now
12:06:51 <shapr> well, not root
12:06:58 <shapr> but hvalidator
12:07:01 <shapr> which does include RE
12:07:20 <shapr> and it seems that RE is also built into the ghci6 libs in debian too
12:07:29 <shapr> so it's exploding when it reaches duplicate symbols
12:07:54 <Si\> but your other version of HXT works?
12:08:26 <shapr> haven't tried it recently
12:08:28 <Si\> try deleting RE.o and RE.hi
12:10:26 <shapr> hehe
12:10:34 <shapr> Fail: /home/simon/Documents/uni/haifa/src/tmdb.xml: openFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
12:10:47 <Si\> lol
12:10:59 <Si\> yes that's the next step
12:11:04 <Si\> I forgot
12:11:13 <shapr> I ended up using ghc since it can deal with dups
12:11:20 <shapr> main = do res <- googleSearch "haskell" (0,10)
12:11:21 <shapr>           putStrLn $ show res
12:11:45 <Si\> open Constants.hs in the root dir of haifa and change the haifaPath func to your loc of haifa (note the trailing slash)
12:11:47 <shapr> ah, Constants.hs
12:12:48 <Si\> it will work, but Google won't give you any data yet
12:12:54 <shapr> why not?
12:13:04 <shapr> no key?
12:13:05 <Si\> because you need a Google Key
12:13:08 <shapr> I have a key somewhere
12:13:33 <Si\> open up GoogleSearch.hs and replace ??????????? with your key
12:14:08 <Si\> in func googleSearchAux
12:14:57 <Si\> you won't be able to use GHCi at all soon anyway
12:15:16 <shapr> why not?
12:15:19 <Si\> when I add in the plugin system GHCi will crash+burn if you try to load with it
12:15:30 <shapr> s'okay with me
12:16:00 <Si\> it's trying to load GHCi into itself
12:16:14 <shapr> right
12:16:53 <Si\> nevertheless, I really don't running half a dozen threads in GHCi + TCP is that gooder idea anyway
12:17:07 <shapr> well, if it doesn't crash
12:21:39 <shapr> I can't find my key
12:21:48 <shapr> I'll apply for a new one
12:22:09 <Si\> ok, only takes a minute to do
12:30:13 <shapr> servers are temporarily unavailable
12:30:58 <Si\> how frustrating
12:31:02 <shapr> yup
12:31:08 <shapr> I'll come back to it later
12:31:15 <shapr> I gotta make some phone calls now
12:31:18 <Si\> ah well try it anyway, it should at least go through the motions
12:31:31 <Si\> ok, cu l8r
13:31:09 <amgine2> i'm trying to work a gui using an example but i get this
13:31:33 <amgine2>  The last statement in a 'do' construct must be an express
13:31:34 <amgine2> ion
13:31:34 <amgine2> Failed, modules loaded: none.
13:32:03 <amgine2> what does it mean exactly ?
13:32:05 <Cale> what's the last statement in your do construct?
13:32:10 <amgine2> return () ?
13:32:30 <Cale> oh, can you paste the code somewhere?
13:32:37 <amgine2> hmmm sure
13:32:45 <Cale> the HaskellIRCPastePage might be good.
13:33:09 <shapr> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
13:33:10 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
13:40:27 <amgine2> what's theh askell if then else syntax ?
13:40:31 <amgine2> if (...) then
13:40:36 <amgine2>     foo
13:40:37 <amgine2> else 
13:40:42 <amgine2>    foo 2 ?
13:40:48 <Cale> if p then x else y
13:40:52 <Riastradh> It's generally indented as:
13:40:53 <Riastradh> if ...
13:40:57 <Riastradh>     then ...
13:40:59 <Riastradh>     else ...
13:41:05 <amgine2> ohhh
13:41:06 <amgine2> i see
13:41:07 <amgine2> interesting
13:42:26 <amgine2> damn it
13:43:53 <Cale> you might go to http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage and paste the code that you're having trouble with so that everyone can help out.
13:44:02 <amgine2> i know
13:44:06 <amgine2> but how quick is that ?
13:44:22 <Cale> quick?
13:44:30 <amgine2> a response
13:44:55 <Cale> oh, the page is just so that us on IRC can see
13:45:01 <amgine2> i see
13:45:02 <amgine2> ok
13:47:35 <Cale> (just click EditText and paste where the comment says :)
13:47:54 <amgine2> i did :)
13:47:55 <amgine2> took me a while
13:47:56 <amgine2> ok
13:48:12 <amgine2> i get this error  parse error before <- at line curDicStr
13:49:17 <Cale> you need more "do"s
13:49:28 <amgine2> ?
13:49:31 <amgine2> what do you mean ?
13:49:47 <amgine2> isn't one do enough ?
13:49:51 <amgine2> now i'm confused
13:50:11 <Cale> when you use an if, Haskell will test to see if the condition holds and return either the then or else clause
13:50:31 <Cale> to be listed as something in a do block, this has to be an IO action.
13:51:01 <amgine2> so i either nest in the if statements
13:51:03 <amgine2> or add dos ?
13:51:13 <Cale> do blocks package together lists of IO actions so that they become one.
13:51:35 <Cale> so you just need a "do system ("exp..."
13:51:49 <Cale> in the then
13:52:12 <amgine2> ohh
13:52:18 <Cale> and you can probably get away in the else clause just by deleting the "return ()"
13:52:28 <amgine2> so if splits it into then and else block which themself have to be like a function ?
13:52:33 <Cale> since logMessage is already going to return an IO action
13:52:42 <amgine2> i see
13:54:43 <amgine2> cale can you look at if (outFile <- it gives me a parse error aswell
13:55:32 <Cale> well, the "if" part of an if statement needs to be a boolean value
13:55:46 <amgine2> isn't it though ?
13:56:17 <Cale> well, outFile isn't, and do block "assignments" aren't really expressions anyway.
13:56:28 <amgine2> i see
13:56:39 <amgine2> how could i test for the result of that assigment than ?
13:58:55 <Cale> well, make the assignment first, then perhaps test to see if the handle is open
13:59:03 <amgine2> i see
13:59:07 <ski> i guess you could catch the IOError
13:59:43 <Cale> yeah, that's probably a better idea
14:00:47 <amgine2> hmmm you take a look now
14:00:53 <Marvin--> right, haskell has exceptions
14:01:08 <amgine2> last statement in do must be an expersion at line
14:01:19 <Cale> there's an extra )
14:01:20 <amgine2> outFile <- afasdf
14:01:40 <amgine2> how do you see ?
14:01:53 <Cale> on the wiki
14:02:02 <Cale> at the end of the outFile line
14:02:12 <Cale> catch :: IO a -> (IOError -> IO a) -> IO a
14:02:13 <amgine2> ohhh yeah
14:02:14 <amgine2> crap
14:02:15 <amgine2> i'm blind
14:03:07 <Cale> so if you want to catch errors, you can make an error handler, and that will turn an action into an action with an IO error handler.
14:03:50 <Cale> a silly error handler here might be (\e -> return ())
14:03:59 <Cale> (i.e. if there's an error, then do nothing)
14:04:10 <amgine2> i see
14:04:20 <amgine2> i'll pass for now
14:04:22 <amgine2> but i
14:04:25 <amgine2> i'll keep it in mind
14:05:09 <Cale> try :: IO a -> IO (Either IOError a)
14:05:17 <Cale> this might be more convenient sometimes
14:05:47 <Cale> the new action will either return Left (someError) or Right (theResult)
14:05:56 <amgine2> hmm
14:09:12 <Cale> (which you'll splice apart with a case expression, usually)
14:12:49 <Cale> One neat thing about using Haskell as an imperative language is that you can build your own control structures, since IO actions are first class values as well.
14:15:54 <amgine2> are variables avilable inside a where clouse from the outside function ?
14:16:18 <Cale> yes
14:16:21 <amgine2> ok
14:16:28 <amgine2> good now i just gotta figure out this mess
14:16:58 <Cale> Another neat thing I found out recently is that when interfacing with outside C code and allocating pointers to memory, "p <- malloc" is all you need to write -- the type of p will be inferred and the right amount of memory allocated.
14:17:10 <ski> variables bound in a do-block is not available in where-clauses, though
14:17:22 <amgine2> SKI
14:17:23 <amgine2> damn it
14:17:23 <Cale> oh, that's a good thing to point out
14:17:24 <amgine2> just great
14:17:28 <amgine2> dman it
14:17:32 <amgine2> i got a do clause
14:17:36 <amgine2> than it call for a function
14:17:52 <amgine2> which i tried defining sepertly but it couldn't access variables
14:17:59 <ski> so you make a let inside the do-block *or* pass the vars you want as args to the func defined in the where
14:18:00 <amgine2> so now you saying it's no different than a where clause ?
14:18:13 <amgine2> but' that turns it messy
14:18:15 <amgine2> and repetative
14:18:17 <amgine2> crap
14:18:20 <ski> which ?
14:18:33 <Cale> amgine2: can we see what you're trying to do?
14:18:47 <amgine2> ahh sigh yeah
14:18:51 <amgine2> but let me have a cigarate first
14:19:18 <ski> you're trying to access variables bound in a do-block in a helper function, right ?
14:19:29 <amgine2> not a helper function
14:19:32 <amgine2> the main function
14:19:36 <amgine2> will that work ?
14:19:41 <amgine2> if i use where ?
14:19:52 <ski> is the do-block in the body of the main function ?
14:20:00 <amgine2> yes
14:20:06 <amgine2> and than withing there is a foo function
14:20:11 <amgine2> after that i use where foo is ....
14:20:46 <ski> so, variables bound in the do-block are of course accessible later in that do-block. but i think this is not your problem ..
14:20:52 <amgine2> so it's like this
14:20:58 <amgine2> blah = do foo
14:21:02 <amgine2>     where foo
14:21:19 <amgine2> will variables from blah be in scope in foo ?
14:21:27 <amgine2> or do i need to pass them as args ?
14:21:40 <amgine2> it seems logical that they would be
14:21:44 <ski> blah x y = do ...
14:21:55 <ski>               ..x..y..
14:21:55 <anduril1>  amgine2: vars that you got by foo <- getSomething won't be in the scope of the where clause
14:22:03 <amgine2> omg
14:22:17 <amgine2> that makes haskell really strange now
14:22:22 <amgine2> i got a headache now
14:22:23 <amgine2> brb
14:22:43 <anduril1> using IO can be confusing at first, but its cool when you get it
14:22:48 <amgine2> i mean whati f you need like 10 variables by the time you get to where function you be passing way to many to be clean
14:22:49 <ski> args to the function are visible both in the body (in this case a do-block), and in the where-clause
14:23:04 <amgine2> ski
14:23:09 <ski> yes ?
14:23:18 <amgine2> so i think you are saying what makes logical sense let me give you ane xample
14:23:28 <amgine2> blah = let x = 10
14:23:31 <amgine2> foo
14:23:35 <amgine2> where foo = x
14:23:39 <amgine2> blah
14:23:43 <amgine2> will result 10 ?
14:23:51 <ski> (perhaps you can paste the problematic code to the wiki, as well ?)
14:24:14 <amgine2> i will oncei  clean up the syntax i move the function into where clause
14:24:19 <amgine2> which screwed somethings
14:24:22 <amgine2> brb i need that cig now
14:24:31 <ski> ok
14:41:01 <amgine2> sigh
14:41:19 <ski> your'e back ..
14:41:21 <amgine2> so there is no difference in using where
14:41:31 <amgine2> and just placing the damn function outside as a seperate one
14:41:34 <amgine2> god damn it
14:41:35 <amgine2> i don't get it
14:41:44 <amgine2> that just makes things a whole lot messier
14:41:48 <ski> yoou could use a let inside the do-block
14:41:56 <ski> have you considered that ?
14:41:58 <amgine2> i have a let
14:42:04 <amgine2> ok i'll give you a qucik summary
14:42:10 <amgine2> gui = do blah
14:42:20 <amgine2>            let foo = 2
14:42:28 <amgine2>           helper
14:42:36 <amgine2>        where helper = foo
14:42:40 <amgine2> say foo is not in scope
14:42:43 <amgine2> i don't get it
14:42:49 <amgine2> it's just unitiutive
14:42:58 <amgine2> i could have as well had to seperate functions gui and helper
14:43:05 <amgine2> what's the point of where ?
14:43:10 <ski> i meant : you could put helper inside the let
14:43:12 <earthy> there is none
14:43:20 <amgine2> jsut for style ?
14:43:23 <amgine2> ski explain
14:43:38 <earthy> nytol
14:43:57 * ski is sometimes also annoyed by do-bindings not visible in where ..
14:44:17 <amgine2> ok so i'm not the only one thinking that's kind of stupid
14:44:19 <amgine2> thank god
14:44:37 <ski> but i'm not sure if it would be sensible to make them be ..
14:44:37 <amgine2> i mean i see only one sollutions shit of load of arguments being passed all the time between functions
14:44:42 <amgine2> ski why ?
14:44:49 <ski> hmm
14:45:16 <ski> well, in a do-block, we're in someone's monad, which we might not have control over
14:45:59 <amgine2> and how could that effect our prior asigments of functions i.e. variables
14:46:08 <amgine2> if were to use them inside a nomad
14:46:13 <ski> so we actually don't know if each var bound in do is going to get a value (or perhaps it's gonna get multiple values)
14:46:34 <ski> but, one could perhaps solve that
14:46:38 <ski> e.g. :
14:47:06 <ski> if a where-binding uses arguments to the enclosing function, ..
14:47:29 <ski> .., then it is a closure
14:47:41 <ski> but if it doesn't use any of those args
14:48:02 <ski> (e.g. we're only using where to hide local helper functions and constants)
14:48:22 <amgine2> you've lost me
14:48:26 <ski> then it could as well be compiled as a top-level function
14:48:28 <amgine2> but thanks for trying
14:48:30 <ski> oh, sorry :(
14:48:39 <amgine2> it's okay i'm just a grasshoper so far
14:48:54 <ski> i suppose i could try to show an example of what i mean
14:48:57 <amgine2> how do you usally go about solving what i have just encountered
14:49:09 <ski> hmm
14:49:17 <amgine2> that's clean
14:49:24 <amgine2> i know i'm gonna run into it again
14:49:32 <amgine2> right now i just solved by moving what i needed to the helper function
14:49:49 <ski> either passing the needed things explicitely (irritating if there's lots of them)
14:50:13 <ski> or instead put the where-definition inside a let in the do-block
14:50:13 <amgine2> yeah that's what i've encoutered before
14:50:15 <amgine2> hated it
14:50:20 * shapr fights with WASH
14:50:29 <amgine2> i'm not sure what you mean by the second one
14:50:32 <ski> (the latter way might use much indenting, though)
14:50:33 <amgine2> can  you give an example ?
14:50:42 <ski> hmm
14:51:20 <ski> i think i'll put it in a file an paste the url, ok ?
14:51:32 <amgine2> yeah sure :)
14:54:04 <ski> hmm, the helper-func in the where ?  is it a do-block or not ?
14:54:15 <amgine2> let's say it is
14:54:19 <amgine2> but it dosen't matter
14:54:19 <ski> ok
14:54:22 <ski> right
14:54:33 <amgine2> i will prob save this example
14:55:56 <Marvin--> ooh, neat
14:56:01 * Marvin-- got a reply from Tanel
14:57:20 <ski> ok
14:57:28 <ski> link at bottom of http://www.mdstud.chalmers.se/~md9slj/'
14:57:47 <ski> (s/'//)
14:58:04 <amgine2> do we always have to use module ?
14:58:09 <ski> no
14:58:47 * Marvin-- goes uhhhh
14:58:52 <amgine2> OHHHHH
14:58:58 <amgine2> so we define helper
14:59:03 <amgine2> as a function
14:59:13 <amgine2> the let gives it the scope of the parent function
14:59:17 <ski> but i think, that if one's going to have a multi-file project, then all (except maybe the main module) files should define a module
14:59:20 <amgine2> and execute it within the main function
14:59:21 <ski> right
14:59:27 <ski> see ? :)
14:59:42 <amgine2> yeah yeah
15:00:02 <Marvin--> ooookay, now gandalf proves this so fast I'm beginning to doubt if it's really correct
15:00:22 <ski> Marvin-- : what's it proving ?
15:00:34 <amgine2> thanks
15:00:39 <ski> sure :)
15:01:02 <Marvin--> ski: it's an induction proof that shows that ordered xs ==> ordered (insert z xs)   (for the standard insertion sort 'insert' function)
15:01:15 <ski> ok
15:04:39 * Marvin-- turned off demodulation and set the proof method to binary resolution
15:05:16 <Marvin--> I have no idea what that means though :P
15:08:23 <Marvin--> I'm off to bed
15:08:24 <Marvin--> 'night
15:08:31 <ski> night Marvin--
15:22:28 <Pseudonym> Greetings all.
15:22:59 <ski> hiya
15:23:02 <Jerub> morning!
15:23:15 <Pseudonym> Currently reading: "Galois Theory", by Ian Stewart.
15:23:21 <Pseudonym> I dipped into this as an undergrad.
15:23:34 <Smerdyakov> That Galois. What a dandy.
15:23:43 <Pseudonym> Having read "Conceputal Mathematics", it actually makes sense now.
15:23:45 <ski> is it interesting ?
15:23:56 <Smerdyakov> I think that's better than dipping into undergrads as a Galois theorist.
15:24:18 <Pseudonym> Well, it throws around terms like "monomorphism" and "forgetful functor", so it's helping to consolidate those concepts.
15:24:22 <Pseudonym> And yes, it's interesting.
15:25:03 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym 
15:25:06 <Pseudonym> G'day.
15:25:23 <Pseudonym> You know, I think a book needs to be written which goes through all this stuff, but using Haskell as the implementation language.
15:25:29 <shapr> have you used WASH before?
15:25:34 <Pseudonym> Who, me?
15:25:35 <shapr> oh, that would be cool
15:25:37 <shapr> yah you
15:25:40 <Pseudonym> No.
15:26:00 <shapr> ok, I'm looking for a clueful person who can guide me through the confusion
15:26:03 <Pseudonym> Yes, it would.  After doing the GraphExamplesInHaskell, I'm 99% sure it could be done.
15:26:57 <shapr> implementations would make a big difference to me
15:27:06 <shapr> most of the time I can't see what this stuff is good for
15:27:14 <Pseudonym> Right.
15:27:20 <Pseudonym> I think so too.
15:27:27 <shapr> occasionally I get glimpses of great elegance, but mostly it's just "huh?"
15:27:35 <Pseudonym> I envisage a book entitled "Categories for the working programmer".
15:27:41 <shapr> sounds great
15:29:15 <Pseudonym> I'm looking into Galois theory because it came up a lot when I was doing logic programming, but I could never work out why.
15:29:46 <Pseudonym> Besides, if you don't know what a Galois connection is, there's one Haskell joke you won't get. :-)
15:30:28 <shapr> what is one?
15:30:38 <Pseudonym> Oh, it's... uhm...
15:30:40 <shapr> heh
15:30:51 <Pseudonym> OK, here's an example from the start of the book.
15:30:51 <shapr> I'll wait till I'm finished with the category theory book
15:31:01 <Pseudonym> This is easy to understand, BTW.
15:31:08 <shapr> ok
15:31:31 <Pseudonym> Consider this polynomial: f(t) = t^4 + 4*t^2 - 5
15:31:46 <Pseudonym> That factorises as: (t^2 + 1)(t^2 - 5)
15:31:57 <Pseudonym> f(t) = 0 has four solutions
15:32:06 <Pseudonym> They are: i, -i, sqrt 5, -sqrt 5
15:32:23 <Pseudonym> Interestingly, these solutions come in pairs.
15:32:56 <shapr> ok
15:33:13 <Pseudonym> Let's call them a = i, b = -i, c = sqrt 5, d = -sqrt 5.
15:33:19 <shapr> ok
15:33:43 <Pseudonym> Now there are a lot of equations derivable from f (details omitted) concerning its roots which are "true".
15:33:55 <Pseudonym> For example, if (b^2 + 1) = 0
15:34:01 <Pseudonym> (which is obvious, I think)
15:34:07 <shapr> yup
15:34:10 <Pseudonym> And (c^2 - 5) = 0
15:34:18 <shapr> yup
15:34:38 <Pseudonym> Also others, like a + b = 0, b*d - a*c = 0 and so on.
15:35:07 <Pseudonym> Now the interesting thing is that these equations are also valid if you "swap" a and b, or "swap" c and d.
15:35:16 <Pseudonym> Take a moment and convince yourself that this is true.
15:35:29 <monotonom> Some Galois connections are abstract interpretations. Some abstract interpretations are used for static analysis of logic programs.
15:35:40 <shapr> it seems like an obvious bit of truth
15:35:43 <Pseudonym> Yes.
15:36:05 <Pseudonym> So the point is that these equations are invariant under some permutations of [a,b,c,d].
15:36:11 <shapr> hm
15:36:13 <shapr> interesting
15:36:15 <Pseudonym> The permutations form a group, called the Galois group.
15:36:16 <ski> but not all ?
15:36:21 <Pseudonym> No, not all.
15:36:23 <Pseudonym> Swap a and c.
15:36:25 <ski> ok
15:36:36 <monotonom> "Galois connections" and "Galois theory" are related but different things.  You don't need Galois theory; you just need Galois connection.  I guess.
15:36:42 <shapr> it's a parallelogram
15:36:43 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
15:37:07 <Pseudonym> OK, that's a Galois group.
15:37:11 <Pseudonym> Kind of.
15:37:16 <shapr> you can lengthen the sides as long as they match, and you can wiggle the angles as long as the changes are equal
15:37:23 <shapr> lengthen or shorten
15:37:50 <Pseudonym> monotonom: I thought "Galois connection" and "Galois correspondence" were synonyms?
15:38:04 <Pseudonym> Shows you what I know. :-)
15:38:11 <monotonom> No.
15:38:41 <monotonom> I mean probably not.
15:38:48 <Pseudonym> http://oldwww.math.uni-potsdam.de/alg1/galoisconf1.htm
15:38:58 <Pseudonym> It says there: The most famous and perhaps oldest example is the Galois connection between certain extensions of a ground field and subgroups of the group of all relative automorphisms of this field. 
15:39:12 <Pseudonym> OK, so they're not synonyms.
15:39:22 <Pseudonym> A Galois correspondence is a kind of Galois connection.
15:39:26 <Pseudonym> But not vice versa.
15:39:30 <Pseudonym> Is that fair?
15:39:53 <Pseudonym> shapr: TO get back to the example.
15:39:56 <monotonom> But there are much simpler or more elementary examples of Galois connections than the original Galois theory.
15:40:02 <Pseudonym> Right, okay.
15:40:18 <Pseudonym> f is a polynomial over the rationals, but its solutions are not rational.
15:40:43 <Pseudonym> To solve f(t) = 0, you actually need to "extend" the rationals to a field which contains its zeroes.
15:41:22 <Pseudonym> And it turns out that these extensions and the Galois group are in 1:1 correspondence.
15:41:26 <Pseudonym> This is the "Galois correspondence".
15:41:40 <Pseudonym> I'm glossing over details, but that's the gist of it.
15:41:51 <Pseudonym> In the language of category theory, it makes much more sense.
15:41:56 <monotonom> Try http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rcb/papers/abstract.html#acmmpc instead
15:42:14 <Pseudonym> Because you have the category of fields and the category of groups, and this is a kind of bijective functor between them.
15:42:38 <Pseudonym> monotom: Ah, useful, thanks.
15:42:42 <shapr> I think that makes sense
15:43:08 <Pseudonym> The point is that it's difficult to find the roots of a polynomial, but it's easy if you know the group.
15:43:13 <shapr> neat
15:43:18 <Jerub> but whats the JOKE. 
15:43:57 <Pseudonym> BRB
15:44:02 <shapr> sleep time for me
15:44:10 <Pseudonym> Night.
15:48:02 <monotonom> Yuck the url I gave does not talk about Galois connections.
15:48:43 <monotonom> But scroll up and down and look for "Aarts"
15:49:40 <monotonom> It's Aarts's thesis, Galois Connections Presented Calculationally.  Chapter 3 has simple examples of Galois connections.
15:50:13 <monotonom> http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rcb/papers/abstract.html#galois actually
17:09:37 <dark> Hello there :)
17:10:26 <dark> It's been a while.  I hope people still remember me.
17:10:40 <ski> hello dark
17:10:52 <ski> i think i remember you
17:11:51 <Pseudonym> Sorry, back.
17:11:55 <dark> Well... I think the most notable thing I did here was formatting the topic as a Haskell list.  So there's not much to remember :)
17:12:32 <Smerdyakov> I think you were working on a game, too!
17:12:41 <dark> Indeed, I was!
17:12:59 <Pseudonym> monotom: Thanks for the links.  I'll read this once I've finished the Galois theory book.
17:13:12 <dark> Several games, in fact :)
17:13:21 <dark> I need to blow a lot of dust off my Haskell code though.
17:13:23 <Pseudonym> "A Relational Theory of Datatypes" looks good, too.
17:13:46 * Smerdyakov is reading _V._ now. Good so far.
17:16:18 <dark> _V._ is a funny title.
17:17:03 <Smerdyakov> dark, you have heard it before?
17:17:06 <dark> I'm wondering whether it's a chapter mark, whether you abbreviated something, or whether it's the book with aliens :)
17:17:15 <ski> Smerdyakov : where's that ?
17:17:41 <Smerdyakov> I know of a TV series with aliens, maybe based on a book.
17:17:50 <Smerdyakov> However, this is not a book about aliens, and it is by Thomas Pynchon.
17:17:57 <Smerdyakov> "V." is the full name.
17:18:12 <ski> aha
17:18:13 <ski> ok
17:18:25 <dark> I'm not sure of the exact history.  It may have been a miniseries that was then written as a book and then spawned a series that was low on plot.
17:18:48 <dark> Ok.  The other book was called "V" without the dot. :-)
17:19:49 <Smerdyakov> Ah. Sort of like how Ralph Ellison named his book _Invisible_Man_ instead of _The_Invisible_Man_. :D
17:23:21 <dark> I finally got around to reading Snow Crash last week.  It seemed a little weird to me because I kept forgetting it was written in 1992 or something.  He predicted a lot of things right, which made the things he got wrong look extra strange :)
19:48:22 <amgine2> damn it
19:48:39 <amgine2> where can i find the attribute list for wxHaskell
19:48:45 <amgine2> i've look in the damn docs
19:48:50 <amgine2> i remmember finding it once
19:48:53 <amgine2> but do so anymore
19:50:03 <skew> I think they were scattered about, defined with the controls that had those attributes
19:50:19 <amgine2> i remmember finding them somewhere
19:50:22 <amgine2> damn i hate this
19:50:23 <skew> I remember finding that stuff too - I'm looking
19:50:29 <skew> ah, classes
19:50:30 <amgine2> makes two of us
19:50:52 <skew> Graphics.UI.WX.Classes defines a bunch of typeclasses, most of the members are attributes
19:51:02 <amgine2> i remmember something different
19:51:07 <amgine2> it had the acctuall list
19:51:12 <amgine2> maybe it was the online docs
19:51:24 <amgine2> like frame and it had the possible attributes
19:51:29 <skew> class Textual w where text :: Attr w String, appendText :: w -> String -> IO (), etc
19:51:30 <amgine2> maybe i was just drunk
19:52:08 <amgine2> ok i'll try to use that page
19:52:09 <amgine2> thanks
19:52:35 <skew> I don't see where the instances come from
19:52:41 <amgine2> ?
19:52:57 <skew> if you could get a list of the instances for Frame, you could look up the classes and see the attributes there
19:53:14 <skew> or for whatever widget you want
19:53:19 <amgine2> yeah
19:53:22 <amgine2> that's what i think i found
19:53:26 <amgine2> much cleaner to look at
19:53:29 <amgine2> and readable
19:55:50 <amgine2> i'm gonna go insane
19:56:26 <skew> Well, the documentation for the Classes module lists instances with each class
19:56:42 <skew> I don't know about and index the other way
19:56:51 <amgine2> k
19:57:12 <amgine2> how would i use clientSize than ?
19:57:23 <amgine2> some of them are := other are just foo x
19:57:28 <amgine2> attributes
19:58:15 <skew> well, clientSize (in class Dimensions) is an Attr w Size
19:58:48 <amgine2> k 
19:58:52 <amgine2> i think i'm understanding this
19:59:04 <skew> oh, you use just the name with get to retrieve the attribute value
19:59:08 <amgine2> after checking the Attr class
19:59:22 <skew> you use attribute := value in the list for set to change it
20:00:25 <skew> do you have any idea why ghci would reject a program with overlapping instances if I'm passing -fallow-overlapping-instances on the command line?
20:01:53 <amgine2> me ?
20:01:55 <amgine2> crap man
20:01:59 <amgine2> i don't even understand the question
20:02:09 <amgine2> sorry
20:03:08 <skew> if anybody else is listening, the instances are for MLift (m (m a)) (m a) and (m (a -> b)) (a -> b')
20:20:48 <skew> GHC seems to reject overlapping instances for a multi-paramater type class even with -fallow-overlapping-instances
20:35:01 <amgine2> set frMain [menubar           := [mnuHlp]                                       
20:35:01 <amgine2>                    ,layout                := column 1 [fill (widget textlog) 
20:35:01 <amgine2>                                                     ,(widget btnCon) 
20:35:01 <amgine2>                                                     ,(widget btnRes)] 
20:35:01 <amgine2>                   ,clientSize           := size 300 300 
20:35:02 <amgine2>                    ,on (menu mnuAbout)     := infoDialog frMain "Thanks" "by Amgine" 
20:35:04 <amgine2>             ]
20:35:13 <amgine2> stretches the textLog only vertically how come ?
20:35:26 <amgine2> i've been reading the manual but can't seem to find the sollution
20:36:16 <skew> I think it's something about how column behaves.
20:36:23 <amgine2> hmmm
20:36:26 <amgine2> crap
20:36:35 <skew> I think I had some trouble with sizing too, but in ion it's a pain to test
20:36:50 <amgine2> ion ?
20:37:04 <skew> I'd check the wxWidgets documentation if the wxHaskell docs don't explain
20:37:08 <skew> a tiling window manager
20:37:13 <amgine2> crap
20:37:20 <amgine2> so much reading for so little
20:37:21 <amgine2> crap
20:38:09 <skew> I think you probably want a hstrech around the column
20:38:22 <skew> or maybe inside, I forget
20:38:24 <amgine2> i tried
20:38:30 <amgine2> you mean hstretch (column ?
20:38:55 <skew> try hstretch (column (map hstretch ...
20:39:01 <skew> see if that workds
20:39:11 <amgine2> i'll give her a go
20:39:41 <skew> the page says a column of a grid (of which column is an instance) is only strechable if all elements can stretch
20:40:03 <amgine2> but aren't they by default ?
20:40:09 <amgine2> acctually you gave me an idea
20:40:16 <skew> what were you using?
20:49:36 <Pseudonym> Can anyone recommend a decent RSS consolidator?
20:49:56 <Pseudonym> Something which remembers where you were up to.
21:02:34 <amgine2> fucken hate it
21:06:22 <amgine2> yes
21:06:23 <amgine2> anywho
21:06:29 <amgine2> could someone explain the $ to me ?
21:06:37 <skew> huh?
21:06:40 <amgine2> ,layout                := grid 1 1 [[fill (widget textlog)] 
21:06:40 <amgine2>                                            ,[alignCenter $ hstretch (row 1 [(widget btnCon) 
21:06:40 <amgine2>                                                                 ,(widget btnRes)] 
21:06:40 <amgine2>                                           )                                             
21:06:40 <amgine2>                                             ]                                
21:06:41 <amgine2>                                                     ]            
21:06:43 <amgine2> this worked
21:06:43 <Pseudonym> ($) is function apply.
21:06:48 <amgine2> meaning ?
21:06:48 <skew> f $ a = f a, with really low precedence
21:06:50 <Pseudonym> f (g x) = f $ g x
21:07:03 <amgine2> as if f . a ?
21:07:31 <amgine2> ohhh 
21:07:32 <amgine2> i see
21:07:33 <skew> pretty much, you can take any pair of parentheses that ends at the end of the expression and replace it with a $ where the first was
21:07:34 <amgine2> it makes sense
21:07:39 <skew> or the other way around
21:07:43 <amgine2> i see
21:07:57 <amgine2> what is difference between f . a and f $ a ?
21:08:27 <skew> the first composes functions f and a, the second applies f to a
21:08:37 <amgine2> so hmm
21:08:37 <skew> f . a = \x -> f (a x)
21:09:05 <amgine2> ?
21:09:07 <ski> f (g x) = f $ g x = f $ g x
21:09:20 <ski> f (g x) = (f . g) x = f . g $ x
21:09:29 <ski> oh
21:09:32 <amgine2> hmmm
21:09:34 <Pseudonym> There is a bit of confusion because f $ g $ x = f . g $ x
21:09:38 <ski> f (g x) = f $ g x = f $ g $ x
21:09:39 <amgine2> let me think
21:09:57 <amgine2> so $ means evaluate it at the end
21:10:06 <amgine2> . means apply the function first than evaluate ?
21:10:31 <amgine2> as in *2 $ 1+1 would mean do 1 + 1 first
21:10:31 <ski> Pseudonym : yeah, $ might perhaps as well been defined as infixl instead
21:10:39 <amgine2> than times by 2
21:10:52 <ski> (* 2) $ 1 + 1
21:11:03 <ski> right
21:11:15 <amgine2> what if it was (* 2) . 1 + 1 ?
21:11:31 <ski> that would probably not make sense
21:11:40 <amgine2> hmm
21:11:44 <amgine2> yeah i figured
21:11:51 <skew> you are trying to use 1 as a function there
21:11:54 <ski> (well, it might, if you made functions instances of Num)
21:12:00 <amgine2> let me think this instead
21:12:08 <skew> unless you have some messed up num instances that won't work
21:12:28 <amgine2> f . a = \x -> f (a x)
21:12:29 <ski> (e.g. instance Num b => Num (a -> b) )
21:12:32 <amgine2> means 
21:12:36 <amgine2> in plain english
21:12:40 <amgine2> for all x 
21:12:47 <amgine2> apply f to (a x)
21:12:56 <amgine2> without evaulating (a x) first
21:13:06 <skew> rather, f compose a is a function that takes a value x and computes f of a of x
21:13:18 <ski> you can think of . as a unix pipe, only the order is reversed
21:13:25 <skew> that says nothing about order of evaluation, really
21:13:33 <amgine2> hmm
21:13:35 <skew> it's just Haskell that's being lazy
21:13:38 <amgine2> ohhh ok
21:13:44 <amgine2> f . g 
21:13:53 <amgine2> compeses a new function out of the two
21:13:58 <ski> right
21:14:08 <amgine2> if f = 2x
21:14:13 <amgine2> and g = x
21:14:24 <amgine2> than f . g = 2x^2 ?
21:14:35 <amgine2> than x would be evaluated ?
21:14:53 <skew> uh, that's not really Haskell
21:14:57 <amgine2> hmmm
21:15:12 <skew> the function definition thingies are missing an x on the left side
21:15:31 <amgine2> what do you mean ?
21:15:41 <skew> it looks like x is an argument, so it's really the value passed as x that gets evaluated sometime
21:16:19 <skew> if you are asking about the actual behaviour an implementation, if you compute (f . g) x then g x will be computed at most one time, when f first needs it
21:16:42 <skew> so, (const 1 . (+2)) undefined will give you 1
21:17:05 <ski> here's another example :
21:17:05 <ski> Prelude> unwords . map reverse . words $ "Hello there, how are you ?"
21:17:05 <ski> "olleH ,ereht woh era uoy ?" :: [Char]
21:17:10 <skew> Hmm, your example is just confused
21:17:45 <skew> you are describing either *, if f = 2 * x and g = x, for some concrete x
21:18:06 <amgine2> can this result in different outcomes depending if it's $ or .
21:18:11 <amgine2> as in 2*2+1 = 5
21:18:18 <amgine2> while 2*(2+1) = 6
21:18:27 <skew> $ and . are very different functions
21:18:52 <skew> so yes
21:18:56 <amgine2> i think i understand
21:18:58 <amgine2> thanks
21:19:01 <amgine2> time to grab a bite
21:19:04 <amgine2> but i'm proud
21:19:12 <amgine2> i spent an entire day to get those little fucker buttons looking nice
21:19:14 <skew> trying to use . in that wxHaskell code would have been problems.
21:19:21 <amgine2> good learning experience
21:19:23 <amgine2> i would think so
21:19:27 <skew> why are you going for pretty?
21:20:00 <skew> do you need to, or just checking if it's possible
21:20:04 <amgine2> just so i learn it ?]
21:20:07 <amgine2> but good point
21:20:10 <amgine2> time to grab a snack
21:20:12 <amgine2> thanks for help guys
21:20:14 <amgine2> brb
22:01:15 <skew> Yay, I've got a zeroth order Python interface - the embedding example translated into Haskell+FFI
22:03:22 <skew> withForeignPtr is cheap, right?
22:13:15 <Jerub> skew: got python coroutines working yet ;)
22:13:42 <skew> no, I'm just trying to call into Python for now
23:01:34 <shapr> ah, I missed dark
23:01:34 <shapr> dang
23:05:27 <shapr> ok, that's the second time that same hostname has spammed the HaWiki, they're going into the banlist now
23:13:18 <shapr> goood morning #haskell!
23:16:11 <skew> Hi shapr.
23:16:17 <shapr> greetz skew
23:16:20 <shapr> how's life in the big city?
23:16:20 <skew> Do you know anything about embedding Python
23:16:40 <skew> I'm home in a small Iowa town now
23:17:14 <skew> It's a good time.
23:18:02 <skew> I just got the Python embedding example to work from Haskell with the FFI, but now the library seems to be missing some symbols
23:18:14 <shapr> I don't know anything about it, sorry.
23:18:20 <skew> Hey, I can ask on #python!
23:18:25 <shapr> yes, good idea
23:25:21 <Pseudonym> G'day.
23:25:28 <Pseudonym> Missed your re-entry.
23:25:42 <Pseudonym> Yes, bad spammers.
23:25:55 <Pseudonym> Dunno if "spam" is technically the right word.
23:26:16 <Pseudonym> Reminds me of the "hackers" we had a few months ago.
23:27:57 <shapr> g'day Pseudonym!
23:28:20 <shapr> oh, here's what I've written recently: http://shapr.homelinux.net/~shae/ProtoMime.hs
23:28:46 <shapr> just loads a mailman mbox file into postgresql (with some filters and cleanup)
23:28:52 <Pseudonym> Cool.
23:28:58 <Pseudonym> Linked it up to lambdabot yet?
23:29:02 <shapr> not yet
23:29:14 <shapr> I want to write a WASH frontend to people can do web searches first
23:29:28 <shapr> but now that you mention it, a lambdabot plugin would be faster to write
23:30:30 <shapr> oh, that code uses HaskellDB and WASHMail
23:42:08 <shapr> hm, can I do a multi-hop scp?
23:44:00 <Pseudonym> Well, you can do an scp from within an ssh shell.
23:47:14 <Pseudonym> Must head off.  Nytol!
23:47:18 <shapr> yah, but will that get it back to the originating box?
23:47:25 <skew> nope
23:47:50 <skew> why do you need a multi-hop connection? Is there a firewall somewhere?
23:47:54 <shapr> yes
23:49:29 <skew> you could probably use a combination of ssh and cat
23:49:59 <skew> something like ssh -e 'ssh -e \'cat file\' destination' firewall
23:50:09 <shapr> heh, that's cute
23:50:35 <shapr> I think I should just patch ssh to take multihop args
23:50:51 <skew> like a bang path. cute
23:52:59 <Cale> It'd be nice if wxHaskell was in Debian. Seems like I have to keep reinstalling it every so often for some reason.
23:53:41 <shapr> it is in debian
23:53:49 <shapr> well, haskell-experimental :-)
23:53:49 <Cale> which package?
23:53:51 <Cale> oh
23:54:34 <shapr> h-e is hosted by SyntaxNinja, and the package maker are usually SyntaxNinja, Igloo, and Heffalump
23:55:02 <Cale> what is the appropriate line to add to my sources.list?
23:55:02 <shapr> deb http://www.syntaxpolice.org/haskell-experimental unstable/
23:55:07 <Cale> :)
23:55:26 <Cale> great
23:55:53 <shapr> hey, did you see Pseudonym's suggestion of a book "Categories for the working programmer" ?
23:56:16 <jdrake> in a case does there always have to be a _ in real world code? I just found in ghci that it seems to be fine if it does find a match, but if not it spits out an error (is this compiler or runtime?)
23:56:21 <Cale> hmm, yeah - I haven't seen that one, I don't think. How is it?
23:56:44 <shapr> well, Pseudonym said it would be a good idea to write this book and use Haskell for running implementations
23:56:49 <Cale> jdrake: you should always handle all possible cases, and if not, provide a default.
23:56:54 <shapr> so I think it'll be great, but I can't tell you ahead of time ;-)
23:57:07 <Cale> ah :)
23:57:32 <shapr> jdrake: it only spits out an error if a non-existing case gets called
23:57:51 <jdrake> sounds unsafe
23:57:56 <shapr> I often put a fallthrough case _ -> error "something broke in function foo!"
23:58:10 <shapr> you can use -Wall, I think it mentions that sort of thing
23:58:13 <jdrake> is there any compiler method of checking for all cases
23:59:23 <jdrake> how can error work? It has a side effect no monad thing going
23:59:33 <Cale> There's a way to get warnings about overlapping patterns, or unhandled cases.
23:59:33 <shapr> try it
23:59:36 <skew> it raises an exception
23:59:51 <jdrake> i see that
