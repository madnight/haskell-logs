01:04:03 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
01:04:17 <maihem> good morning shapr
01:05:02 <shapr> hey maihem, wassup?
01:07:29 <maihem> not a lot. I've given my little state machine practice proggy a machine that counts the number of "the" triggers it receives, and emits an event with the total each time, so now I can parse "the"'s out of a file with my ealier statemachine, and count them! :)
01:07:40 <shapr> it's time to code!
01:07:56 <shapr> cool!
01:07:57 <maihem> next stop, a machine to spot newlines, and a machine to filter based on newlines
01:08:23 <shapr> it sounds a bit like a regular expression engine
01:09:10 <maihem> hmm, regular expressions use a state machine. I haven't just intended it for parsing text though.
01:09:43 <shapr> oh, ok
01:10:02 <skew> hey people.
01:10:05 <maihem> hey skew
01:10:32 <skew> hi
01:10:39 <skew> I'm making some sort of state machine too
01:10:57 <skew> except I want a bunch running concurrently sending messages to each other
01:11:12 <maihem> That's what I'm doing ;)
01:11:19 <skew> hey, nice
01:11:57 <maihem> I've made one combinator so far, and now going to make another in a moment, emacs has already opened.
01:12:03 <skew> does each have several distinct inputs?
01:12:17 <maihem> no, I'm gonna just zip stuff up.
01:12:17 <skew> or at least some way to listen for some message while letting others just sit in the queue?
01:12:38 <skew> aww. That's the main thing I'm trying to figure out
01:12:50 <maihem> ah, no, I want my machines to all transition at the same time
01:13:12 <skew> mine is more for simulating distributed systems, so that wouldn't be so good
01:13:38 <skew> what's the combinator do?
01:13:55 <maihem> You can emulate it by interlacing all the events in a wrapper, and have the statemachines transition back to themselves when a trigger for a different machine happens
01:14:20 <skew> yeah, but I don't want to lose the messages.
01:14:39 <skew> It's for things like letting read requests just queue up in a reader/writer lock
01:14:55 <skew> you can implement it yourself, but it seems like nice semantics to provide
01:15:08 <maihem> Link s s' - it's just a machine made of the two machines s and s'. a trigger sent to it triggers s, and the emitted event is used as a trigger for s', unless it is Nothing
01:16:18 <skew> I'm thinking more in terms of guarded actions for my system. I've got some stuff for making and connecting channels, but no combinators for making logic yet
01:18:34 <maihem> for multipe channels and building up complex machines that actually run in parralel, I'm just using the same input for two machines, and evaluating there output during the same IO action, thus everything happens in lock-step
01:19:48 <skew> I'm using channels and threads
01:20:23 <skew> maybe something more like that could be useful for coding individual processes
01:21:27 <maihem> yeah, mine would be useless for examinine the possiblity of race conditions, unless you encoded random "nop" triggers in the input, and made them different for each machine.
01:21:32 <maihem> A horrible thought
01:22:08 <skew> you forgot randomly dropping, duplicating, and reordering messages...
01:22:21 <maihem> oh yeah :)
01:23:44 <skew> not that I'm trying to simulate that or anything, I'll just get it for free if I make it run on the internet
01:24:42 <skew> I'm just trying to make a library a bit closer to the formalisms, not actually prove stuff.
01:24:59 <skew> well, time for bed. Bye.
01:25:23 <skew> (yes, _this_ is a sane bedtime for my timezone...)
01:25:35 <maihem> bye
01:40:54 <maihem> ???     Non-type variables in constraint: Transition f t Bool
01:41:44 <maihem> line is: instance (Transition s t e, Transition f t Bool) => Transition (Filter s f) t e
01:41:54 <maihem> huh?
01:43:02 <maihem> f and t must be such that the are in the Transition relationship: Transition f t Bool
01:54:40 <musasabi> Is GHC able to use deforestation for simple recursive definitions?
01:54:54 <musasabi> or should one just use map/foldr
03:33:37 <haskellNewb> anybody got any ideas of why my assignment fails one test in ghci but passes all tests in hugs??
06:00:04 <shapr> hi Maddas 
06:00:06 <Maddas> Hi
06:52:00 <Spark_> is it 'principal type' or 'prinicple type' ?
06:52:23 <Lor> principal
06:52:48 <Spark_> do those two different spellings actually have different meanings too
06:52:54 <Spark_> or is it just like dependent and dependant
06:53:09 <Lor> principal is an adjective, principle is a noun.
06:53:16 <Spark_> ah of course
06:53:17 <Spark_> cheers
06:53:20 <Lor> All right, principal can _also_ be a noun.
07:01:37 <shapr> yeehaa
07:03:21 <Maddas> hmm?
07:05:01 <shapr> wheee
07:05:49 <Spark_> boing
07:06:08 <shapr> hi Spark_ 
07:06:13 <shapr> hey Lor, long time no see
07:06:32 <Spark_> good erm afternoon i think
07:06:35 <Spark_> something like that
07:08:20 <Lor> Hi, shapr.
07:09:03 <Lor> I disabled my net connection for a few months to get rid of distractions while working on my thesis.
07:09:11 <Lor> In vain, though. :)
07:09:16 <shapr> heh :-)
07:09:21 <Maddas> Hah
07:09:27 <Maddas> Now that's self-discipline :-)
07:09:44 <Lor> No. Self-discipline would be working on the thesis even if you _had_ a net connection.
07:09:49 <Maddas> Oh, hm, yes.
07:10:01 <Lor> I disabled it precisely because I _don't_ have self discipline.
07:10:09 <Maddas> At least it was wise :-)
07:10:13 <Maddas> (I guess)
07:10:23 <Lor> Well, I didn't really progress very fast anyway...
07:10:39 <Lor> Still not finished but at least I'm well over halfway there.
07:10:51 <Maddas> What's it about?
07:11:02 <Lor> Typed reflection.
07:11:40 <Maddas> Sounds interesting (not that I know what that is, though)
07:12:00 <Lor> Well, you know what types are? And you know what reflection is?
07:17:54 <Maddas> Lor: No, I don't really know about reflection.
08:21:36 <ZERODN|L> Hey i was wondering if anybody can help me, i'm a bit of a haskell n00b and need some help converting string to integer
08:23:04 <keverets> read is the function you want
08:23:22 <ZERODN|L> yeah i know that thanks, but my problem is a little deeper
08:23:49 <keverets> what's the problem?
08:23:53 <ZERODN|L> i have say a list of integer in string like 12,2,4,5
08:24:04 <ZERODN|L> and i need to convert that to a list of int
08:24:12 <ZERODN|L> the only thing is it takes 12 in as 1 and 2
08:24:15 <ZERODN|L> instead of 12
08:24:20 <Lor> Add brackets around it and read. :)
08:24:51 <keverets> read "[3,5,2]" :: [Integer]
08:25:15 <ZERODN|L> no but its a set, so it has {} at each end
08:25:58 <keverets> drop the { and take until the }
08:26:11 <keverets> or replace the {} with []
08:26:29 <ZERODN|L> so the commmas wont interfere with teh read function
08:26:40 <keverets> try it and see.
08:26:47 <ZERODN|L> ok, thanks
08:28:23 <Lor> That is a hack, of course, and not the "proper" way to do it.
08:28:39 <Lor> But in this particular case it probably works.
08:28:56 <ZERODN|L> what would be the proper way
08:29:40 <Lor> To parse the input lexically into individual decimal numbers, and then convert those to integers.
08:30:34 <ZERODN|L> I did try that but it ended up a worse disaster, i'm just learning
08:32:43 <Lor> You might want to learn about the lex function.
08:34:00 <ZERODN|L> well this is part of a course at college and i dont want to do anything that hasnt been taught
08:34:21 <Lor> Ah, well, what have you been taught, then? :)
08:34:26 <keverets> don't be afraid of learning on your own.
08:35:05 <ZERODN|L> pretty much just the basics, like lists trees type classes etc
08:35:55 <ZERODN|L> it was just a four week thing 2 nights a week
08:36:22 <Lor> I suggest you first separate the input into individual decimal numbers (and get rid of the commas), and then convert those strings into integers individually.
08:36:58 <ZERODN|L> yeah i tried to do that in two seperate functions
08:37:19 <ZERODN|L> but what happened was say one of the numbers was 145
08:37:31 <ZERODN|L> i ended up with a 145 then a 45 then a 5
08:37:53 <ZERODN|L> because i didnt know how to start and end a list over two different functions
08:37:54 <Lor> That means just that you have to fix your function, not that there is anything wrong with the basic approach.
08:39:07 <ZERODN|L> can you take a look at it for me its only about 12 lines at most, then just point me teh right way
08:39:30 <Lor> Wasn't there a channel dedicated to flooding?
08:39:43 <ZERODN|L> dont know i was just poing to pm it to you
08:39:52 <ZERODN|L> cause i got kicked from anotehr channel once for that
08:39:55 <Lor> Others may be interested, too.
08:39:57 <musasabi> Can GHC do deforestation optimisations for recursive functions?
08:39:59 <saz> there's a page on the wiki 
08:40:03 <saz> for flooding
08:40:12 <Lor> Hi, musa.
08:40:21 <musasabi> hello, lor
08:40:26 <Lor> musa, try and see. :)
08:40:47 <musasabi> hmm actually writing code for a seminar paper...
08:41:42 <ZERODN|L> sorry whats the wiki
08:42:23 <Lor> http://haskell.org/hawiki/
08:43:06 <ZERODN|L> whres this place i can flood upon then
08:43:23 <Lor> http://haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
08:43:46 <ZERODN|L> thats pretty cool
08:44:16 <Lor> Click on the "editpage" at the bottom, then add your own code to the end.
08:44:44 <Lor> Probably a good idea to wrap it in {{{#!syntax haskell ... }}}
08:45:15 <ZERODN|L> how do i make sure it goes in a new box
08:45:22 <ZERODN|L> and not in somebody elses work
08:45:44 <musasabi> looks like it does, at least for overly simple cases
08:45:47 <Lor> It's not an important page. You can overwrite the earlier code if you want.
08:46:00 <Lor> It's just for temporary stuff.
08:46:19 <musasabi> but it keeps overflowing the stack...
08:46:49 <Lor> Then there must be something wrong with your code. :)
08:48:03 <ZERODN|L> ah ok there it is at the very bottom, sorry it look very feeble compared to others code
08:48:51 <ZERODN|L> but i guess i have to learn somewhow, even if i start very bad
08:49:41 <Lor> Yes, all right.
08:49:54 <Lor> You are actually not taking the approach I suggested.
08:50:09 <Lor> You're traversing the list and converting the elements to ints as you go.
08:50:55 <ZERODN|L> so teh way i'm doing it cant be fixed easily
08:51:17 <Lor> Not with a one-line change, I'm afraid.
08:51:49 <musasabi> rekursiivinen m‰‰ritelm‰ n‰ytt‰‰ jopa nopeammalta kuin foldr ?
08:52:06 * musasabi is too tired
08:52:14 <Lor> Although your approach makes sense, it's perhaps not the easiest one to implement if you're learning the language.
08:52:22 <musasabi> the recursive definition looks even faster than foldr
08:52:48 <Lor> So I suggest you break the problem into two distinct parts: separate the input string into a list of strings (containing the decimal representations of the numbers), and then convert each string into a single integer.
08:53:14 <Lor> musa, funny, foldr ought to be inlined anyway.
08:53:18 <ZERODN|L> ah i see
08:53:42 <ZERODN|L> your a star, i'll be back if it ends disasterous
08:53:55 <musasabi> I am trying to see when ghc uses deforestation and using a user defined sum function as a example. "sum1 xs = foldr (+) 0 xs" seems slower than "sum2 (x:xs) = x + sum2 xs"
08:54:51 <musasabi> Perhaps it could have to do with stricness...
08:55:16 <musasabi> reality allways plotting against nice models
08:55:16 <Lor> use foldr1
08:55:41 <Lor> No, don't.
08:56:16 <Lor> musa, you're using full optimizations? Are you looking at the core code it produces?
08:57:26 <musasabi> Lor: that is even slower...
09:00:30 <Lor> What's the type signature? Are those polymorphic, or specialized to a single type?
09:00:52 * musasabi looks at the hc
09:01:19 <Lor> sum2 seems to inline the dictionary access, while sum1 uses plusInteger 
09:03:08 <Lor> Oops, sorry, that was only because I eta-reduced the xs out of sum1.
09:03:56 <Lor> Now that I fixed them, ghc generates identical code for both.
09:04:04 <musasabi> specialing the functions to Int seemed to cause a huge speedup
09:04:14 <musasabi> and makes foldr clearly the fastest
09:04:28 * musasabi thought that it would just instantinate optimized versions
09:05:07 <Lor> My ghc still generates identical code, even with sum1, sum2 :: [Int] -> Int
09:05:32 <musasabi> sum1 :: [Int] -> Int
09:05:32 <musasabi> sum1 xs = foldr (+) 0 xs
09:05:32 <musasabi> sum2 :: [Int] -> Int
09:05:32 <musasabi> sum2 []     = 0
09:05:32 <musasabi> sum2 (x:xs) = x + sum2 xs
09:05:40 <musasabi> are my definitions
09:06:03 <musasabi> GHC is The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.2.1
09:06:27 <Lor> Mine is just 6.2, but I don't think that's what causes this.
09:06:51 <Lor> Hm, I only looked at the generated code, but if you use those functions, then they might be inlined differently.
09:07:05 <musasabi> sum1 is ten times faster than sum2 with main = print (sum1 [1..600000]) (or sum2)
09:07:48 <Igloo> sum1 might be matching a GHC optimisation rule
09:09:54 <Marvin--> that's likely, surely enumFromTo is classified as a good producer and foldr a good consumer?
09:11:21 <musasabi> sum1 is even faster than sum...
09:11:46 <Marvin--> hm, sum doesn't have a SPECIALIZE rule for Int?
09:12:24 <musasabi> brb (sauna + angry gf)
09:12:25 <Lor> musa, what kind of code does it generate?
09:12:35 <Lor> Bah.
09:13:16 <Igloo> foldr is the fast one, isn't it?
09:13:31 <Marvin--> hm, sum is implemented with foldl
09:15:17 <Lor> Makes sense, otherwise it would blow up on big lists.
09:18:26 <ZERODN|L> hey sorry to disturb again, i really dont know how to take in a whole string up to a point, i'm used to using while loops
09:18:53 <saz> use take
09:18:53 <Lor> Yes, it's a bit tricky.
09:18:56 <saz> :-)
09:19:20 <ZERODN|L> what does take do
09:19:21 <saz> (better still, implement it as a learning exercise)
09:19:36 <Lor> Again, there are lots of ways how to do it, but I suggest a very explicit approach.
09:20:42 <Lor> Or do I?
09:22:04 <Lor> Using a simple accumulator you'd have to reverse it, but if you return a tuple you'd have to open it up at every iteration...
09:22:55 <Lor> Hm, perhaps the tuple approach is still the most straightforward, even though it is horribly inefficient.
09:24:11 <Lor> That is, you write a recursive function takeNumber :: String -> (String,String) that returns all the numerals at the beginning of the input string, and the rest of the string.
09:24:16 <Lor> Oops.
09:25:46 <Lor> Hm, rehubilitation.
09:25:58 <ZERODN|L> oh there was a netslplit
09:27:14 <ZERODN|L> yeah but how do you take in character up to a point
09:27:23 <Smerdyakov> ZERODN|L, what does that mean?
09:27:34 <ZERODN|L> what? netsplit
09:27:36 <Lor> You could use an accumulator without reversing, but that is really inefficient (quadratic(.
09:27:49 <Smerdyakov> ZERODN|L, no, "take in character up to a point."
09:27:56 <ZERODN|L> oh lor was helping me
09:28:16 <ZERODN|L> taking in character up will i hit say a comma or such
09:28:27 <Smerdyakov> "Taking in" doesn't mean much in functional-land.
09:28:39 <ZERODN|L> sorry as i said a lot earlier i'm a n00b
09:28:43 <ZERODN|L> just starting
09:28:57 <Smerdyakov> All the same, you ought to be able to explain better what you want.
09:29:51 <ZERODN|L> a string of character like (12,345,2,6,14) and i want to breat the integer individually
09:29:58 <ZERODN|L> so i have 12 and 345 ...
09:30:11 <Lor> zero, there is a standard functon known as span
10:07:52 <musasabi> back
10:48:56 <shapr> yow!
11:07:25 <Lunar^> shapr: We've finally found a title for our first paper about hOp... you deserve credits : "hOp: making Haskell code run on bare metal"
11:42:47 <rt> but haskell only walks, it doesn't run. :-)
11:46:34 <shapr> I'd say it just meaders lazily
11:46:38 <shapr> "meanders"
11:46:43 <shapr> Lunar^: I'm glad I can help :-)

14:24:22 <Jon> my personal fave
16:42:45 <shapr> yow!
16:45:43 <heatsink> Is there a builtin to make a new list from the first n items of a list?
16:46:00 <shapr> take
16:46:01 <shapr> @type take
16:46:02 <lambdabot> take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
16:46:09 <heatsink> oh
16:51:04 <heatsink> nice
16:54:49 <Lunar^> heatsink: It's not exactly a builtin
16:55:05 <Lunar^> heatsink: It's a function from the Prelude, which is imported by default in every Haskell program
16:55:20 * Pseudonym yawns
16:55:27 <Pseudonym> Excuse me.
16:55:53 <heatsink> that's kind of what I meant
16:56:26 <Lunar^> heatsink: The Prelude _is_ written in Haskell. take _ [] = [] ; take 0 _ = [] ; take n (x:xs) = x:take (n - 1) xs
16:57:17 <heatsink> I just meant that I didn't want a DIY solution... I could have done it but I thought this would be provided in a library
16:58:20 <Lunar^> heatsink: Sure it is :) Studying the Prelude is really usefull when learning Haskell because these small functions are quite easy to rewrite
16:59:45 <heatsink> How do I study the prelude?
17:00:48 <heatsink> Hugs seems to have a Prelude.hs and I don't see one for ghc
17:01:19 <Lunar^> heatsink: Look at http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html
17:02:21 <Lunar^> heatsink: Try to guess by name and type what each function does, to be sure, check how they behave with Hugs or GHCi... after that, try to rewrite them :)
17:02:34 <heatsink> what is GHCi?
17:02:46 <Lunar^> heatsink: The 'i' stands for interactive
17:02:51 <heatsink> ok
17:03:13 <Lunar^> It's GHC interpreter, works quite like Hugs when called on the command line
17:04:42 <heatsink> Hmm, it's somewhat different from the haskell I know
17:04:51 <heatsink> identity a = a
17:05:02 <heatsink> -> parse error on input '='
17:05:22 <Lunar^> Mhh.. local definitions need to be preceeded by the "let" keyword
17:05:57 <Lunar^> The easiest way to use GHCi is to have a separate .hs source file that you load by :l Module, and that you reload by using :r
17:06:17 <heatsink> ok
17:06:22 <Lunar^> You can then test your functions by typing simple expressions 
17:08:20 <heatsink> alright
17:41:11 <ZERODN|L> Hey sorry to disturb, i was just wondering if anybody could tell me the most efficient way to find the intersection of two binary trees?
17:44:25 <Pseudonym> Are your binary trees balanced?
17:45:15 <ZERODN|L> no i dont think
17:45:28 <Pseudonym> OK.  The reason I ask is that the balance information is sometimes helpful.
17:45:53 <Pseudonym> Here's the general approach which usually works:
17:46:03 <ZERODN|L> Sorry i'm a bit of a beginer at the language
17:46:37 <Pseudonym> You pick a key (somehow).  Then you splay both trees to bring that key to the root in both trees.  You process the root, then recursively intersect both subtrees.
17:46:45 <Pseudonym> Actually, it _always_ works. :-)
17:46:58 <Pseudonym> The problems are: 1) How to pick a key?
17:47:19 <Pseudonym> Actually, that's the main problem.
17:47:48 <ZERODN|L> well its just a tree of int
17:47:52 <Pseudonym> Yes.
17:48:06 <Pseudonym> So probably your best bet is to pick the root of one of the trees and splay the other.
17:48:26 <ZERODN|L> sorry but whats splay?
17:48:52 <Pseudonym> Can I ask what this is for, as a matter of interest?
17:49:11 <ZERODN|L> well i'm just doign a night course at college
17:49:17 <Pseudonym> http://www.cs.nyu.edu/algvis/java/SplayTree.html
17:49:42 <Pseudonym> OK, just checking.
17:50:12 <ZERODN|L> np
17:51:00 <Pseudonym> Basically what you do is rearrange one of the trees so that it has the same root as the other.
17:51:19 <ZERODN|L> i see
17:51:24 <Pseudonym> That's assuming that the second tree actually has the element in it, of course!
17:51:29 <Spark_> twee!
17:52:29 <ZERODN|L> well its something to work on thanks, i had no clue where to start
17:52:36 <Pseudonym> Cool, no problem.
17:53:32 <Spark_> If i want to refer to the Hindley-Milner type algorithm from an undergraduate paper, what should i link to?

17:58:08 <Pseudonym> I think that's the paper.
17:58:16 <Pseudonym> Robin Milner: A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming. J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 17(3): 348-375 (1978)
17:58:17 <Pseudonym> Sorry.
17:58:26 <Spark_> cool
17:58:42 <Spark_> can i find it on google?
17:58:57 <Pseudonym> Don't know.  Might be in the ACM digital library or something.
17:59:23 <Pseudonym> Actually...
17:59:38 <Pseudonym> Take a look at the higher-order kinds paper.  There might be a better reference in there.
18:00:03 <Pseudonym> Sorry, higher-rank types.
18:00:12 <Pseudonym> http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/putting/
18:00:52 <Pseudonym> L. Damas and R. Milner. Principal type-schemes for functional programs. In 9th symposium Principles of Programming Languages, pages 207-212. ACM Press, 1982.
18:00:55 <Pseudonym> May also be useful.
18:01:55 <Spark_> mm cool
18:02:25 <Pseudonym> Yes, that Milner paper is the one.
18:02:30 <Pseudonym> The first one.
18:03:15 <Pseudonym> I believe that the term "Hindley-Milner" refers to one particular type _inference_ algorithm, by the way.
18:03:40 <Spark_> ah right
18:03:45 <Pseudonym> I _think_.
18:03:59 <Pseudonym> Oddly, 
18:04:06 <Spark_> ill read the paper and see if it directly applies :)
18:04:14 <Pseudonym> Ah!
18:04:16 <Pseudonym> http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mail-www/haskell/msg00218.html
18:04:21 <Pseudonym> Read and be enlightened.
18:06:57 <Riastradh> I bet if you attain total enlightenment while drinking beer, it makes beer shoot out of your nose.
18:09:44 <Spark_> blimey
18:10:06 <Spark_> has type inference been used in a procedural language?
18:10:53 <Spark_> e.g. removing the need to define the types at all
18:11:03 <Pseudonym> I don't think so.
18:11:26 <Pseudonym> If variables can be assigned to more than once, I think it's impossible to determine that variable's type.
18:11:44 <Riastradh> Uh, no.
18:11:46 <Spark_> surely its type has to support both protocols
18:12:15 <Spark_> so if you first add an int to it then it has to be a number, but if you had 0.5 later on, it has to be a float
18:12:18 <Spark_> or somethign like that
18:12:43 <Pseudonym> I'm thinking more if you have polymorphism.
18:12:47 <Riastradh> No, you just force it to be an integer, and adding 0.5 is a type error.
18:13:08 <Spark_> Riastradh: why?
18:13:14 <Riastradh> Pseudonym, what's the type of [[ref []]] in OCaml?
18:13:22 <Pseudonym> Riastradh: I don't know.
18:13:29 <Riastradh> '_a list ref
18:13:35 <Riastradh> Once assigned, that '_a turns into something specific.
18:13:57 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK, I see.  So in an imperative language, every variable is a reference.
18:14:02 <Igloo> Your quoting really doesn't work well for a FP channel...
18:15:27 <Igloo> Anyway, bed time
18:15:45 <shapr> yes, soon
18:19:50 <shapr> so, what's going on?
18:22:30 * Pseudonym hears crickets chirping for some reason
18:22:49 <Pseudonym> Grrrr... these decimal-biassed people.
18:23:04 <shapr> what about that exact real library?
18:23:09 <Pseudonym> What about it?
18:23:10 <shapr> why don't people use that for everything?
18:23:40 <shapr> it seems like it gets around the inexact math problem
18:23:40 <Pseudonym> Oh, this is a discussion that comes up occasionally where non-mathematically-sophisticated people hang out.
18:23:47 <Pseudonym> Does 0.9999... = 1?
18:24:01 <shapr> I don't think so
18:24:08 <Pseudonym> Yes, it does.
18:24:11 <shapr> oh
18:24:18 <Pseudonym> Proof: Consider 0.39999... and 0.4.
18:24:23 <Pseudonym> Convert them both to binary.
18:24:26 <Pseudonym> Try to tell the difference.
18:24:29 <shapr> heh :-)
18:24:55 <shapr> is it much harder to do math ops on exactreal stuff?
18:25:01 <Pseudonym> Not really.
18:25:04 <Pseudonym> It can be a lot slower.
18:25:09 <Pseudonym> Like, many orders of magnitude.
18:25:20 <Pseudonym> Hours rather than milliseconds.
18:25:49 <shapr> hm
18:26:10 <Pseudonym> It depends what you're doing.
18:26:27 <Pseudonym> OPtimising your expressions help a lot, and it's not always obvious how to do that.
18:28:33 <shapr> is it possible to create exactreal hardware that works somewhere close to as fast as the IEEE-754 hardware?
18:28:43 <Pseudonym> No.
18:28:55 <Smerdyakov> What is "exactreal"?
18:29:13 <Pseudonym> Exact real representations use a potentially unbounded amount of memory.
18:29:18 <Pseudonym> IEEE-754 doesn't.
18:29:24 <Pseudonym> The best you can do is interval arithmetic.
18:29:27 <Pseudonym> I think.
18:29:46 <Smerdyakov> I'd rather not run out of memory when I take the square root of 2....
18:29:48 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: One of a number of libraries for doing computation on real numbers.
18:30:10 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: Well, you don't necessarily run out of memory if you have lazy evaluation.
18:30:38 <Smerdyakov> Oh. It all becomes clear now.
18:30:42 <Pseudonym> Personally, I only use exact real arithmetic for constructing constants.
18:31:19 <Pseudonym> If I need, say, Gauss-Kronrod weights, I can compute them exactly, then produce enough digits to fill an IEEE double precision float.
18:31:30 <Pseudonym> No round-off error.
18:33:20 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/haskell-libs/libs/exactreal/
18:33:27 <Pseudonym> There are a couple of implementations there.
18:48:46 <shapr> g'night
18:48:52 <Pseudonym> Night.
