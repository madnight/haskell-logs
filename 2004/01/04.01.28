01:00:20 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
01:00:47 <andersca> hey hey shapr
01:01:26 <shapr> hej andersca 
01:01:52 <shapr> Bjorn's library is cool, but I haven't persuaded it to talk to Zope yet.
01:02:15 <andersca> I've talked to a friend who works on the same project
01:02:24 <andersca> might be able to get him here
01:02:55 <shapr> my strace output implies that only the first line is being sent
01:03:14 <shapr> but I'm not sure.
01:03:31 <andersca> I think I'm gonna do some C# hacking today
01:03:44 <andersca> or C hacking more likely
01:04:19 <shapr> are there freedesktop debs?
01:05:11 <andersca> shapr: hmm, good question
01:05:16 <andersca> I think so
01:05:38 <shapr> the transparent X looks nifty, is that what you use on your desktop?
01:06:08 <andersca> not yet
01:06:13 <andersca> but I've hacked on it
01:06:56 <andersca> shapr: what I'd like now is to connect my phone to my music player using d-bus
01:07:15 <shapr> so you can play music for people on hold? :-)
01:07:28 <andersca> no
01:07:36 <andersca> I want the music to fade down and pause when someone calls
01:07:42 <shapr> oh, neat
01:08:00 <andersca> also, I want it to fade down and pause when the bluetooth signal strength gets below a certain value
01:13:46 <earthy> sounds like what Romeo on Mac OS X allows me to do.
01:14:03 <earthy> pause music if my phone rings, pause music if I walk away from my machine
01:16:23 <andersca> yes
01:16:57 <earthy> very cool, indeed. ;)
01:35:01 <det> shapr: apt-cache says no
01:37:23 <shapr> yup
01:37:24 <shapr> too bad
01:37:48 <det> does the fdo server have much support for various vid-cards ?
01:38:26 <shapr> ATI (Radeon, Rage 128), Mach64, Matrox, Vesa, Fbdev
01:39:08 <shapr> and DRI integration
01:39:51 <shapr> it seems to have a single-model nvidia driver, dunno if that'll ever be expanded
01:43:30 <andersca> ati radeon is the best supported card right now
01:43:36 <andersca> I wrote the matrox driver :)
01:43:41 <shapr> cool!
01:45:55 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: y0
01:46:07 <shapr> greetings gene9 
01:46:20 <gene9> hi shapr
01:46:28 <shapr> how's code?
01:47:25 <gene9> it rocks. but unfortunately I have not much time for haskell... C++ and python.
01:47:40 <shapr> working code is good code
01:47:47 <gene9> yep
01:48:40 <shapr> andersca pointed me to an xmlrpc lib for Haskell, so I want to combine write Zope services in Haskell.
01:49:27 <phubuh> morning dudes
01:49:36 <shapr> hej phubuh, how was the slang?
01:50:29 <phubuh> it went kind of okay, I wasn't prepared at all though
01:52:10 * shapr yawns
01:52:14 <shapr> need more coffee...
02:21:43 <phubuh> modify $ \s -> s { hubname = Just name }
02:21:58 <shapr> StateT ?
02:22:00 <phubuh> is there any way to make that a little more convenient, without making a setter for every thing?
02:22:01 <phubuh> yup
02:22:21 <shapr> how do you want it?
02:23:20 <phubuh> having to make a lambda seemed annoying, but I guess it's no big deal
02:23:27 <shapr> there is some accessor code in IRC.hs of lambdabot, but I don't remember how simple it gets.
02:23:38 <shapr> specifically StateT {} accessor code.
02:23:42 <phubuh> I'll check that out :)
02:24:05 <shapr> I do remember that Darius came up with a good suggestion for StateT {} accessors.
02:26:02 <Lunar^> phubuh: look at modifys
02:26:33 <Lunar^> phubuh: mhhh I'm dreaming I think
02:26:42 <phubuh> yeah, I can't find that on google :)
02:31:57 * shapr yawns
02:32:07 <shapr> hi Arnia 
02:34:18 <Arnia> Hey shapr
02:34:24 * Arnia bounces
02:35:00 <shapr> what's up?
02:35:58 <Arnia> Setting up a friend's old vaio with Gentoo and doing some research whilst it compiles the kernel
02:36:18 <shapr> ah, fun
02:36:25 <shapr> have you seen PreludeExts on HaWiki?
02:36:49 <Arnia> No... what's in it?
02:37:01 <shapr> all sorts of interesting code
02:37:04 <shapr> @wiki PreludeExts
02:37:04 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/PreludeExts
02:39:46 <Arnia> That's a lot of code...
02:39:52 * Arnia dives in
02:40:39 <shapr> it started small, like a snowball at the top of a mountain.
02:41:00 <Arnia> Yeah... it needs to be reorganised I think :)
02:41:10 <shapr> yah, I agre
02:41:22 <shapr> if no one else does that, I'll do it when I have time.
02:42:56 <shapr> I still can't figure out why this Haskell XmlRpc lib won't talk to Zope.
02:44:04 <Lunar^> shapr: strange that
02:44:24 <shapr> could be user error 
02:44:27 <Arnia> Why is there a bottom in this room? :)
02:44:33 * shapr grins
02:44:38 <shapr> you should ask him
02:44:42 <phubuh> ssh, don't evaluate him
02:44:45 * shapr laughs
02:45:42 <Arnia> Oh the wonders of FP punning ;)
02:49:30 <shapr> nice signoff message
02:50:02 <phubuh> heh
02:50:12 <Arnia> I think there should be a pact for random words as signoff messages
02:50:59 <shapr> hey Arnia, have you tried both Haskell's FFI and Python's SWIG or native FFI?
02:51:11 <shapr> I'm curious about the relative difficulty.
02:52:58 <Arnia> Actually haven't tried either... I'm planning to try Mondrian at some point cos I want to see how well I can integrate haskell and c#
02:53:40 <det> shapr: was it you I was discussing FFIs with earlier ?
02:53:49 <shapr> I have no experience with SWIG, and only a few hours with Haskell FFI, but I sure like Haskell's FFI.
02:53:58 <shapr> det: phubuh mostly
02:54:01 <shapr> and Riastradh 
02:54:07 <shapr> it's lunchtime
02:54:23 * Arnia contemplates the snow
02:54:53 * shapr watches the seven foot snowplow go past the window
02:55:28 <Arnia> Miniplow :)
02:55:34 <shapr> yup
02:55:52 <shapr> the larger ones are overkill for our side street
02:56:52 <Arnia> Britain's weather is so mild that we can't cope with snow or heatwaves... we shut down :)
03:01:09 <Lunar^> What's SWIG ?
03:11:28 * phubuh would like a class TypeNamable a where nameType :: a -> String, and deriving things that generate instance TypeNamable Foo where nameType _ = "Foo"
03:27:42 <phubuh> yay, the client logs in and stays logged in :-)
03:29:56 <phubuh> time for lunch
03:38:10 <rubix> phubuh, nice idea
04:36:10 <shapr> @yow
04:36:11 <lambdabot> Just imagine you're entering a state-of-the-art CAR WASH!!
04:36:52 <shapr> phubuh: can't you just make an instance of show?
04:36:54 <ozone> phubuh: that's fairly similar to dynamic
04:38:01 <phubuh> shapr: I don't want to interfere with regular Showiness, but I could define the typeclass myself, but then I'd need an instance for every type, and that'd be annoying
04:38:03 <phubuh> ozone: ooh
04:38:39 <shapr> Is there some way to hook into the autoderiving machinery?
04:40:26 <shapr> I don't think I really understand darcs' patch theory.
04:40:48 <shapr> some of david's descriptions of how darcs does things have totally scrambled my brains.
04:43:08 <Lunar^> phubuh: with reifyDecl, that sounds quite easy
04:43:14 <shapr> phubuh: hey did, you see Tomasz' nifty code?
04:43:24 * phubuh is intrigued
04:43:28 <phubuh> shapr: hmm, I don't think so
04:43:31 <shapr> ipHeaderLayout =
04:43:32 <shapr>     Record  
04:43:32 <shapr> 	"IPHeader"
04:43:32 <shapr> 	[ BitField "Word8" BE [ (4, Just ("iphHeaderLen", "!Word8"))
04:43:32 <shapr> 			      , (4, Just ("iphVersion", "!Word8"))]
04:43:32 <shapr> 	, Field "iphTOS"	(Unsigned 1 BE)	"!Word8"
04:43:40 <phubuh> ooh
04:43:57 <shapr> haskell-cafe
04:44:03 <phubuh> yeah, reading it now :-)
04:44:11 <shapr> looks awesome
04:44:15 <shapr> uses Template Haskell
04:44:26 <shapr> this could be perfect for a library that parses binary file formats
04:44:34 <phubuh> yeah!
04:45:14 <Lunar^> It's really really nice
04:45:37 <shapr> ah, that code I pasted is a suggestion for a way to do binary file parsing
04:45:49 <shapr> I thought it was the actual code at first read
04:46:15 <shapr> I want that!
04:46:37 <Lunar^> shapr: There's an attachment
04:46:52 <phubuh> ooh, the attached Example.hs also looks awesome
04:47:37 <shapr> yes, it does
04:48:03 <shapr> I'm going to email him and ask for the unparser.
04:48:20 <shapr> er, encoder
04:48:41 <earthy> joy. 5cm/h snowfalls this evening.
04:48:58 <shapr> earthy: this gives you a great chance to stay inside and code!
04:49:11 <earthy> and I need to go to a meeting
04:49:20 <shapr> bring snowshoes
04:49:29 <earthy> I don't have any. :)
04:50:44 <earthy> snow in .nl is rare.
04:51:21 <shapr> does  "ghc -O2 --make Example"  work for you?
04:51:44 <shapr> ohh, I think TH names changed in 6.2
04:52:09 <shapr> anyone know the details of the name changes? I wonder if it's in the 6.2 news
04:54:49 <Lunar^> With BitField support this would totally rocks
04:54:53 <Lunar^> for HoP
04:54:57 <phubuh> HoP?
04:54:59 <phubuh> ah, right
04:55:03 <shapr> hOp!
04:55:06 <Lunar^> hOp ! ;)
04:55:06 <phubuh> ghc on the metal :-)
04:55:12 <shapr> yah, naked ghc
04:55:34 <Lunar^> $ strip ghc > hOp
04:56:13 <phubuh> hee hee
04:59:55 <ozone> shapr: yeah, they fixed it to be faaaaaar less braindead
05:00:14 <ozone> check it out of cvs yourself (just the THSyntax.hs file) and see
05:00:25 <shapr> question is...
05:00:41 <shapr> what did the old names turn into?
05:01:25 <shapr> Data, RecConstr, Var, Con, Tapp, Tcon, TconName, Instance ?
05:05:10 <Lunar^> -package haskell-src ?
05:06:09 <shapr> no, I'm pretty sure those are Template Haskell constructors for 6.0 that have since changed names in 6.2
05:21:18 <shapr> hey, I have a cheesy idea
05:21:40 <shapr> have a lambdabot plugin that keeps a record of all the various bits of Haskell source we find on the web
05:22:03 <shapr> something like the @fact plugin
05:23:22 <Lunar^> That could be great
05:23:29 <Lunar^> @last-links
05:23:30 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "last-links", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:23:49 <shapr> oh, you think lambdabot should regex capture for http:// links?
05:24:37 <shapr> I was thinking @lib-add <name> <url> <keywords>
05:24:53 <phubuh> both sound cool
05:25:46 <shapr> @lib-add md5 http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/md5/ md5 hash cryptography
05:25:46 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "lib-add", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:25:58 <shapr> @lib-search hash
05:25:59 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "lib-search", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:27:00 <shapr> is that a good design?
05:27:51 <shapr> maybe better to use straight up record syntax for greater detail?
05:28:36 <phubuh> I think it's good
05:28:45 <phubuh> but what do you mean by straight up record syntax?
05:29:07 <shapr> @lib-add Package {name="md5",url="http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/md5/",version="0.1.0",keywords=["md5","hash","cryptography"]}
05:29:08 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "lib-add", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:29:46 <shapr> that would let you easily do @lib-update md5 {version="0.1.2"}
05:30:11 <shapr> but it's more complicated
05:30:33 <phubuh> I'm not sure if a version field is useful
05:31:22 <shapr> it would suck to have to put in a whole new record for any update
05:31:37 <shapr> on the other hand, simple and working is a great advantage
05:31:45 <phubuh> @lib-change md5 name md6
05:31:45 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "lib-change", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
05:32:01 <shapr> fair enough
05:32:05 <phubuh> :)
05:32:33 <shapr> great, should I write it? or does someone want to volunteer?
05:33:21 * phubuh is busy hacking scout :-)
05:33:27 * shapr grins
05:43:20 <shapr> hej ski 
05:43:25 <ski> hej
05:43:29 <ski> hej shapr
05:44:37 <ski> haoller pao att configa om mitt konto till nytt system
05:44:57 <andersca> oj
05:45:02 <ski> ?
05:46:13 <ski> andersca : huh ?
05:46:34 <shapr> jag köpt en ny harddrive igor
05:46:41 <phubuh> oh, duh
05:46:49 <phubuh> Show TypeRep does exactly what I want
05:47:14 <ski> shapr : (sv. haorddisk)
05:47:18 <shapr> oh, thanks
05:47:28 <phubuh> that ao represents an Ã¥ :)
05:47:43 <ski> ay ?
05:48:02 <shapr> ett hundred tjugo gigabytar, årta megabytar cache
05:48:56 <shapr> whoops åtta
05:49:26 <shapr> anyways, the new drive is also a maxtor but the shop said it DOES NOT have EZ-BIOS, so I will be able to install kernel 2.6 on it.
05:49:48 <phubuh> what's this EZ-BIOS=
05:49:49 <phubuh> ?
05:50:03 <ski> (ao is &aring; IIC)
05:51:25 <shapr> minus the expletives, EZ-BIOS is a boot sector BIOS hack that let win95 and friends see the whole 60 GB drive by remapping the numbers of cylinders, heads, and tracks to a different set of numbers.
05:52:15 <phubuh> hah, crazy
05:52:41 <shapr> that was fine since kernel 2.4 didn't argue, and would use the hacked BIOS numbers
05:52:42 <phubuh> yay, now I get prettily printed Chans
05:52:48 <phubuh> <Channel (Message.Message)>
05:52:52 <phubuh> <Channel ([Char])>
05:53:04 <phubuh> shapr: ah, annoying
05:53:22 <shapr> but 2.6 wants to talk to the hardware itself, and since the partitions were formatted with this imaginary number of CHS, 2.6 can't mount any partitions!
05:53:34 <phubuh> heh
05:54:28 <shapr> I was not happy.
06:05:49 <ski> 2127 mail msgs expunged
06:05:52 <ski> yay !
06:05:58 <shapr> wow
06:06:48 <ski> shapr : btw, this system actually seems to have a readline lib ...
06:06:57 <shapr> oh, did you get darcs built?
06:07:05 <ski> haven't tried yet
06:07:10 <ski> but will
06:07:12 <shapr> ok
06:07:27 <ski> the old sys hadn't
06:08:46 <raver> hi
06:08:51 <ski> hi raver
06:13:10 <raver> hi ski how is gonig on?
06:13:12 <raver> :)
06:13:18 <ski> good
06:13:23 <raver> cool
06:13:36 <ski> have i talked to you before ?
06:13:49 <raver> i don't remember
06:13:51 <raver> sorry
06:13:56 <ski> ditto :)
06:14:16 <ski> i'm building darcs now
06:14:38 <raver> darcs?
06:14:48 <ski> http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/
06:16:04 <raver> wow
06:16:15 <shapr> darcs is nifty
06:16:20 <ski> used at scannedinavian e.g.
06:16:48 <ski> no prob in build yet :)
06:17:55 <raver> i was thinking to build a gtk2 application with haskell
06:18:00 <raver> just to try it
06:18:07 <phubuh> raver: gtk2hs looks fantastic
06:18:08 <raver> do you know any good link for doc?
06:18:14 <raver> ah ok
06:20:22 <raver> there a lot of tools about haskell in freebsd ports
06:20:27 <raver> fair play
06:20:28 <raver> :)
06:21:23 <phubuh> nice :) debian doesn't have that many in the main distro, but SyntaxNinja set up a nifty dedicated haskell deb repository
06:22:11 <raver> good guy :)
06:22:27 <shapr> he's also doing the LIP, and I can barely wait to use that.
06:23:03 <phubuh> LIP?
06:23:10 <shapr> Library Infrastructure Project
06:23:16 <phubuh> ah, yeah
06:23:30 * raver realizes he must read more about haskell project
06:24:03 <shapr> I wonder if a CPAN-style Functionally Automated Thingy would be called FATLIP
06:25:49 <ski>  /usr/libexec/elf/ld: final link failed: No space left on device
06:26:15 <shapr> aiee!
06:26:23 <ski> heh
06:26:48 <ski> hmm, gonna try at another account
06:39:49 * Igloo hopes LIP will mean it's easy to package a larger number of things for Debian with a similar level of effort
06:46:11 <shapr> hej an9n
06:46:28 <shapr> vad händer?
06:47:50 <shapr> is your nickname short for anineymous?
06:48:02 <ski> (anonymous)
06:48:18 <shapr> yes, but an9n instead of anon, so anineymous instead of anonymous?
06:48:46 <an9n> no
06:48:49 <an9n> heheh
06:48:56 <shapr> oh, what does it mean?
06:48:57 <an9n> its a wordplay in japanese
06:49:07 <shapr> oh, I don't know any japanese, too bad.
06:49:29 <shapr> are you learning Haskell?
06:49:34 <ski> an9n : what does it mean ?
06:49:44 <an9n> an is my realworld nick name and 9n pronunces "kun" and is equivalent to "san", but for boys
06:50:08 <ski> instead of for adults ?
06:50:27 <an9n> I know some haskell, though I'm not yet very skilled in funcional languages
06:50:57 <an9n> ski, often, but also informally among peers
06:51:01 <shapr> do you have some questions?
06:51:48 <an9n> shapr, well actually, I'm compiling ghc, and just noticed chalmers bhc
06:52:15 <shapr> ghc is the most commonly used implementation, as far as I know
06:52:17 <shapr> lambdabot uses ghc
06:52:22 <shapr> @fortune
06:52:23 <lambdabot> In Corning, Iowa, it's a misdemeanor for a man to ask his wife to ride
06:52:23 <lambdabot> in any motor vehicle.
06:53:44 <an9n> Yeh, figured I'd start out w/ ghc
06:54:57 <an9n> ski, phubuh, you linked to chalmers by any chance?
06:55:13 <shapr> an9n: are you at chalmers?
06:55:17 <ski> an9n : studying at GU/chalmers
06:55:57 <phubuh> I'm far away from GÃ¶teborg, but everyone else seems to live and study there
06:56:03 <an9n> shapr, ski yeh
06:56:22 <shapr> phubuh: am I closer to you than Göteborg?
06:56:37 <an9n> phubuh, Hahahah yes, gothenburg, the strong hold of haskell
06:56:40 <phubuh> shawn: you live far up north, so yeah, I think
06:56:47 <phubuh> err, shapr
06:56:51 <shapr> I'm in Boden, next to Luleå
06:56:54 <phubuh> shapr: I'm near GÃ¤vle, know where that is?
06:56:57 <shapr> no clue
06:57:05 <an9n> shapr, I'm in gbg
06:57:08 <shapr> I'm just an invader.
06:57:14 <an9n> shapr, lol
06:57:20 <shapr> er, invandrare :-)
06:57:42 <an9n> damn, compiling ghc takes time!
06:57:48 <earthy> an9n: no shit
06:58:13 <shapr> let's start a research project, grid compiling GHC :-)
06:58:21 <phubuh> http://www.sna.se/bin/map.cgi?Klickbar+Sverigekarta.x=41&Klickbar+Sverigekarta.y=119&lang=SE&system=overview
06:58:23 <earthy> (on the 500 MHz Ultra Sparc I usually let the compile run overnight, *hoping* to see it done the next day)
06:58:27 <phubuh> Sandviken, that's me
06:58:54 <phubuh> wow, I didn't expect that link to work :-)
06:59:13 <shapr> oh, I think you're close to gbg than to me.
06:59:21 <shapr> but not by much
06:59:34 <phubuh> yeah, I'm about smack in the middle :)
07:00:47 <shapr> http://www.sna.se/webbatlas/700/32_16.html
07:01:30 <phubuh> I have a friend and half-brother in LuleÃ¥
07:01:38 <shapr> does he do Haskell? :-)
07:01:46 <phubuh> nope :/
07:02:19 <phubuh> the former's studying at the basketball high school, the latter's in luleÃ¥ universitet studying to be a civil engineer
07:02:36 <shapr> ah, too bad
07:04:22 <phubuh> hmm, ghc doesn't seem to have a stat64, or something that lets me find the sizes of huge files
07:06:20 <an9n> @fortune
07:06:20 <lambdabot> Watch Rincewind.
07:06:20 <lambdabot> Look at him.  Scrawny, like most wizards, and clad in a dark red robe on
07:06:20 <lambdabot> which a few mystic sigils were embroidered in tarnished sequins. Some might
07:06:20 <lambdabot> have taken him for a mere apprentice enchanter who had run away from his
07:06:21 <lambdabot> master out of defiance, boredom, fear and a lingering taste for
07:06:24 <lambdabot> heterosexuality.  Yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon
07:06:25 <lambdabot> that marked him as an alumnus of Unseen University, the high school of magic
07:06:27 <lambdabot> whose time-and-space transcendent campus is never precisely Here or There.
07:06:29 <lambdabot> [6 @more lines]
07:06:38 <shapr> ah, pratchett
07:08:06 <phubuh> inline C would be pretty awesome
07:08:35 <phubuh> well, not that kind of inline, but definition of small C functions from Haskell
07:08:36 <Igloo> You can do inline C with things like hsc2hs I believe
07:08:45 <phubuh> ooh, nifty
07:17:51 <ozone> phubuh: yeah, i was thinking of implementing inline C with template haskell
07:20:21 * Igloo did that with strings for (a small piece of) an ncurses interface
07:20:50 <Igloo> Hmm, I need to make my proof trees taller and thinner
07:25:32 <an9n> brb
07:25:48 * an9n is away: I'm away (gone at 28th Jan, 16:28:21)
07:34:10 <shapr> Igloo: bonsai proofs?
07:34:53 <ski> prune the tree's carefully !
07:35:20 <SyntaxNinja> good morning, all.
07:35:30 <ski> good afternoon
07:37:14 <shapr> hey SyntaxNinja 
07:37:22 <shapr> did you see the gforge responses?
07:37:31 <shapr> if so, have a moment to discuss?
07:40:16 <ski> shapr : busy ?
07:40:37 <shapr> somewhat, but I'll help if I can.
07:41:06 <ski> some of these boxen here's FreeBSD
07:41:37 <ski> so i might be able to install a binary ..
07:42:15 <ski> the cmd 'pkg_add -r darcs' doesn't work though :(
07:42:34 <ski> (can't find file darcs.tgz at ftp server)
07:42:55 <shapr> strange, the darcs page says it should work
07:42:58 <ski> yes
07:43:16 <ski> "Error: FTP Unable to get ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ports/i386/packages-4.8-release/Latest/darcs.tgz: File unavailable (e.g., file not found, no access)"
07:43:50 <shapr> I don't know, I haven't used FreeBSD much, but you may want to ask on the darcs mailing list.
07:44:02 <ski> ok, hm.
07:46:46 <SyntaxNinja> how's it going, shapr?
07:46:51 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: yeah. I've seen them.
07:46:53 <SyntaxNinja> can talk for a minute.
07:48:42 <shapr> what do you think?
07:49:40 <shapr> Olaf seems to think up-to-date listings are most important
07:50:02 <shapr> Marlow seems fine with gforge or not gforge
07:50:46 <shapr> Olaf and John both seemed to think lightweight was good.
07:51:34 <shapr> sounds to me like they want your OSS listing cgi :-)
07:53:51 <SyntaxNinja> heh
07:53:56 <SyntaxNinja> maybe
07:53:58 <SyntaxNinja> ...
07:54:17 <shapr> I suspect that's what Olaf's student is writing.
07:54:39 <SyntaxNinja> no one seems to think it's an evil or bad idea, but I think that we need to address several points before bringing it to the wider community.
07:55:11 <shapr> which points?
07:56:36 <shapr> I think noncommittal covers the responses.
07:58:02 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, noncommittal is definitely there :)
07:58:16 <SyntaxNinja> points like 'make a stronger case over sf.net'
07:58:33 <SyntaxNinja> which should really be converted to "why would people use projects.haskell.org if they're not already using sourceforge"
07:58:34 <shapr> important features - projects {listing, hosting {sources, binaries}}, web pages
07:59:45 <shapr> Marlow said 'we'd get bug/patch/etc metadata'
08:02:22 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, that's definitely good
08:02:44 <SyntaxNinja> someone did say that they'd be willing to move ghc if this takes off, so that's a good sign :)
08:02:48 <shapr> darcs support, Haskell listed as one of the programming languages, available bandwidth
08:02:57 <shapr> yah, that was impressive
08:03:33 <shapr> I think that was assuming it was hosted on haskell.org though, and I got the impression Olaf and John didn't want to admin gforge on haskell.org
08:04:25 <SyntaxNinja> did John say anything?
08:04:37 <shapr> no, only Olaf
08:04:44 <shapr> John said more stuff could be moved to the wiki
08:05:28 * shapr shrugs
08:05:34 <SyntaxNinja> that is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure how that works w/ source code
08:07:15 <shapr> tarball and binary hosting isn't too hard for any random person to get, but sharable VC isn't
08:08:21 <SyntaxNinja> yeah, definitely.
08:08:34 <SyntaxNinja> but sf offers that.
08:08:38 <shapr> right
08:08:42 <SyntaxNinja> why aren't more ppl using sf, that's one big question.
08:08:45 <SyntaxNinja> I think we need to understand that.
08:08:56 <shapr> I think that's the essence of the discussion.
08:09:37 <shapr> from what I've seen, it's partially because cvs is a pain to set up, learn, and admin
08:09:58 <shapr> imho, darcs is superior there.
08:10:41 <shapr> offer free darcs hosting to Haskell projects?
09:19:39 <andersca> hey bring!
09:19:57 <shapr> hey bring!
09:20:08 <bring> hi
09:20:31 <bring> heard you were asking for me
09:20:40 <shapr> hey, I hacked in support for foo.com:8080 into HTTP.hs
09:20:51 <bring> cool
09:20:55 <shapr> but I'm unable to get XmlRpc to talk to Zope
09:21:12 <bring> could be a HTTP version thing
09:21:14 <shapr> strace'ing my test_client2 seems to imply that only the first line of the output is being sent
09:21:23 <shapr> not the actual xml
09:21:31 <bring> ok, the problem is this:
09:21:48 <bring> HTPP.hs does HTTP 1.1, and uses chunked transfers
09:22:18 <bring> but the XML-RPC spec says to use HTTP 1.0, which doesn't support chunked transfers AFAIK
09:22:24 <shapr> oh
09:22:29 <shapr> is there a fix?
09:22:38 <shapr> add unchunked transfers to HTTP.hs?
09:22:39 <bring> so, ideally we should have a haskell HTTP 1.1 implementation
09:22:46 <bring> sorry, I meant hTTP 1.0
09:23:21 <bring> guess we could hack HTTP.hs to do both, and have some option to choose protocol
09:23:26 <shapr> yah
09:23:27 <andersca> bring: have you gotten the compiler book yet?
09:23:43 <shapr> what's the status on the HaskellDB alpha? still on schedule?
09:23:50 <bring> no
09:23:56 <bring> should be
09:24:01 <shapr> spiffy
09:24:33 <bring> it would be a great help if you would try out the current CVS version of HSQL
09:25:01 <shapr> I've used HSQL with postgresql, lambdabot had that for @fact for awhile
09:25:06 <bring> there will be a HSQL release soon and it would be great if as many people as possible could try the CVS version out before the release
09:25:08 <bring> nice
09:25:23 <shapr> sure, I'll try it out.
09:25:25 <bring> which version do you use?
09:25:39 <shapr> I haven't used it recently because it's such a pain to reinstall when new ghc debs are released.
09:25:59 <shapr> and it's a pain to keep the code in lambdabot, because then it makes it hard for other people to build lambdabot 
09:26:15 <bring> you mean the DB code?
09:26:25 <shapr> yes, HSQL 
09:27:04 <shapr> is that the version you were asking about?
09:27:17 <Lunar^> damn
09:27:21 <Lunar^> I had a patch on the fire
09:27:25 <Lunar^> Never found the time to finish it
09:27:35 <Igloo> If you make a Debian package of it all that shoudl be needed is a rebuild and reinstall  ;-)
09:27:37 <shapr> your patch burned up? :-)
09:27:44 <Lunar^> lol
09:27:51 <Lunar^> french idiomatic ;)
09:27:57 <bring> a patch for HSQL?
09:28:38 <shapr> if HaskellDB is released for GHC, and XmlRpc can talk to zope, I'll have ample reason to debianize HSQL, HaskellDB, and XmlRpc
09:28:42 <Lunar^> yes
09:28:52 <shapr> I could get paid to write Haskell! w00!
09:29:00 <Lunar^> lol
09:29:18 <shapr> Zope's ZSQL really sucks, imho
09:29:21 <andersca> shapr: and no one will know it's not python
09:29:22 <andersca> ;)
09:29:24 <shapr> right!
09:29:29 <bring> :)
09:29:38 <andersca> time to see if rc2 works better
09:30:02 <bring> what did you patch do?
09:30:08 <bring> s/you/your/
09:30:27 <shapr> bring: any idea how much work to make HTTP.hs HTTP 1.0 compatible?
09:30:36 <Lunar^> bring: resoolve some segfault
09:30:52 <bring> what version is it against?
09:30:53 <Lunar^> bring: make the whole thing thread safe
09:31:30 <Lunar^> bring: Don't remember... do you want the file to see by yourself 
09:31:31 <Lunar^> ?
09:31:46 <bring> Lunar^: sure
09:32:02 <Lunar^> bring: mail ?
09:32:14 <shapr> I filed an autoconf patch for HSQL, I never checked to see if it was applied.
09:33:59 <bring> what did it fix?
09:34:41 <Lunar^> lovingnulare
09:34:46 <Lunar^> oups
09:35:10 <shapr> just declared the AC_VERSION compatibility I think, since HSQL required an earlier version that was incompatible with the latest autoconf in debian/unstable
09:36:45 <Lunar^> bring: gone
09:37:01 <shapr> is sourceforge alive?
09:37:16 <bring> doesn't seem like it is
09:37:21 <bring> CVS works though
09:37:40 <shapr> I'd like to check the patch tracker, maybe the patch has been set to "applied" or something.
09:38:25 <bring> I was thinking the same thin :)
09:40:08 <shapr> ah the patch was to put "AC_PREREQ(2.53)" into configure.in
09:41:24 <shapr> seems to have changed name to configure.ac, and I don't know if it's needed anymore.
09:41:59 <bring> there is no AC_PR in there AC_PREREQ in there anyway
09:42:14 <shapr> there it is: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=704441&group_id=65248&atid=510289
09:42:28 <bring> can you try the current CVS version and see if it is still needed?
09:43:01 <shapr> I'll try it later, I have to go back to Zope work soon.
09:45:16 <bring> I don't think anyone is notfied when patches are added to the SF project page
09:45:18 <shapr> shouldn't I get "Unknown Transfer-Encoding" from uglyDeathTransfer if that's the problem?
09:45:29 <andersca> ugh, still the same error :/
09:46:07 <bring> I think you'd only get that if the server uses some transfer method that HTTP.hs doesn't understand
09:46:18 <bring> but now it's the other way around
09:47:01 <shapr> it only understands chunked, right?
09:47:02 <bring> for sumbitting HSQL patches, you are probably better off emailing Krasimir Angelov or me
09:47:05 <shapr> ok
09:47:42 <bring> well, I think it understands all standard transfer mode, the problem is that it uses chunked when sending stuff
09:47:47 <shapr> ohh
09:47:55 <bring> which the server doesn't like
09:48:05 <shapr> that makes sense.
09:48:24 <shapr> well, I'll fight with it more later.
09:48:32 <shapr> nice to meet you in realtime
09:48:35 <bring> I'll have a look at it
09:48:43 <bring> nice to meet a user :)
09:48:46 <shapr> :-)
09:48:50 <shapr> ok, back to zope work for me
09:48:55 <bring> haven't announced XmlRpc at all
09:49:03 * shapr points accusingly at andersca 
09:49:08 <bring> aha
09:49:39 <shapr> btw, there's no make install
09:49:43 <shapr> but the README mentions one
09:49:53 <andersca> shapr: you were asking about xmlrpc, weren't you?
09:49:54 * andersca doesn't remember
09:50:03 <shapr> yes, I've wanted XmlRpc for Haskell for a long time.
09:50:10 <shapr> so I'm very happy you pointed me to it
09:50:14 <shapr> I can make money with this!
09:50:31 <bring> :)
09:50:47 <bring> hmm, seems I only put the install target in src/Makefile
09:51:00 <bring> so "make -C src install" for now
09:51:08 <bring> I'll try to fix that
09:51:12 <bring> but be warned:
09:52:08 <bring> I haven't gotten around to make the modules use the hierachical namespace, so they go straight in your ghc/imports
09:52:35 <bring> and, of course, the whole thing is so pre-alpha it's not even funny
09:53:32 <shapr> I can contribute.
09:53:36 <bring> cool
09:53:40 <shapr> I can even host a nice darcs repo for XmlRpc, if you want.
09:54:58 <bring> it's in CVS on my home machine right now, I've been thinking of moving it to sourceforge
09:55:08 <shapr> anyways, XmlRpc would save me from the unit test hell that is Zope.
09:55:17 * andersca finds the reason for 2.6.1 being weird wrt irq routing
09:55:29 <bring> ?
09:55:40 <andersca> shapr: I remember when we used zope for news.gnome.org 
09:55:46 <shapr> what did you think?
09:55:55 <andersca> it didn't really scale well
09:56:30 <bring> has anyone tried any haskell web-apps on a large scale?
09:56:53 <shapr> John Hughes did something in WASH for the last ICFP contest
09:56:58 <shapr> there's the Munich rent calculator
09:57:03 <shapr> I forget how it was written
09:57:21 <shapr> other than the CGI libs, there's HWS-WP, and WASH
09:57:26 <shapr> I don't know of anything else.
09:57:36 <andersca> need mod_haskell :)
09:57:41 <bring> :)
09:58:02 <shapr> I heard there was an alpha of mod_haskell that used GHC, was it ever released?
09:59:00 <shapr> http://losser.st-lab.cs.uu.nl/mod_haskell/
09:59:19 <shapr> april 2002
09:59:46 <shapr> HaskellDB would make webapps much easier.
10:01:50 <shapr> anyways, back to zope
10:04:23 <bring> Lunar^: never got your mail
10:09:54 <bring> anyone here know Warrick Gray (he wrote HTTP.hs)?
10:23:00 <jameson> Hi! Is anyone here familiar with algebraic types with explicit algebraic identities (such as 'data L t = Nil | Cons t (L t) | Inf t' where 'Inf a = Cons a (Inf a)')? Does ghc support something like this?
10:36:20 <esap> I don't think ghc supports that, though I guess you can write functions that simulate it [e.g. inf a = Cons a (inf a)]. But it's not quite the same thing.
10:37:25 <jameson> True... are there any languages that support it, or do you happen to know of any research on building compilers with support for this?
10:37:52 <esap> No, maybe something related to refinement types?
10:40:54 <jameson> I'm not familiar with refinement types; Tim Freeman's thesis looks interesting, though...
10:41:49 <esap> refinement types allow you to specify types that are subsets of algebraic data types, such that the type includes some specific uses of the constructors
10:43:35 <jameson> While this is not exactly what I was looking for, it may be relevant from another angle.
10:43:54 <jameson> Thanks for your pointer, at any rate!
10:45:08 <Lunar^> bring: strange :(
11:10:53 <phubuh> hmm, I'm confused as to how to approach this...  I've got a bunch of thread running StateT's, and I want to them to share another mutable structure
11:11:04 <phubuh> bunch of threads, rather
11:11:47 <phubuh> this isn't exactly the best part of Haskell :-)
11:12:12 <Lunar^> It still is a better than C
11:12:31 <phubuh> oh, definitely
11:13:36 <phubuh> I guess I could put an MVar in the StateT states and use liftIO to get to the global data
11:13:51 <Lunar^> urg
11:14:05 <Lunar^> that shounds like a giant lock
11:14:06 <phubuh> yea, it's not pretty
11:16:19 <shapr> MVar was designed for that sort of thing, iirc
11:19:34 <shapr> that is, for several threads to have access to a mutable thingy
11:20:12 <phubuh> oh, maybe it is pretty :-)
11:20:20 <Lunar^> shapr: Yeah.. but putting it in a record with all common data :(
11:22:13 <shapr> oh
11:22:53 <bring> shapr: think I found the problem with HTTP.hs
11:23:03 <bring> it wasn't the chuncked transfer
11:23:08 <bring> but close
11:23:26 <bring> it seems HTTP.hs isn't really HTTP/1.1 compliant
11:24:18 <shapr> oh?
11:25:17 <bring> in HTTP/1.1, the client can delay sending the request body until it gets "100 CONTINUE" from the server
11:26:18 <bring> but since the server might not understand HTTP/1.1 the RFC says that the client should not wait forever for "100 CONTINUE"
11:26:27 <bring> but HTTP.hs waits forever :)
11:26:49 <shapr> ohh
11:27:35 <shapr> I'll have to see how Zope deals with that.
11:27:39 <bring> so I have hacked it to not use the 100-continue trcik
11:27:44 <bring> which seems to work
11:27:53 <shapr> yay
11:27:55 <shapr> do you have diffs?
11:32:26 <shapr> or entire sources compleat with debug statements? :-)
11:33:11 <bring> I'll put the sources up in a minute
11:33:24 <shapr> spiffy
11:33:34 <bring> and I'll show you how to enable logging of all the traffic
11:35:55 <Lunar^> bring: The code has gone through quite a lot of changes
11:36:12 <bring> to say the least
11:36:54 <bring> but I think that it is an improvement
11:37:18 <bring> the MySQL driver is leass than half the size it was before
11:37:55 <shapr> logging == debugStream stuff?
11:39:02 <bring> yeah
11:39:04 <bring> ok
11:39:09 <bring> so you found that already :)
11:39:18 <bring> did you want something else?
11:39:19 <shapr> I've seen it, but don't know how it works.
11:40:19 <shapr> I couldn't see how to turn it on in the five seconds that I looked at it.
11:41:59 <shapr> so yes, I would like to know how to enable logging of all the traffic.
11:42:22 <bring> ok, I'll put a Bool in HTTP.hs that controls it
11:42:45 <shapr> yah, I'm used to weenie stuff like Python where you set __debug__ = 1
11:42:57 <shapr> har du provat #haskell.se ?
11:43:06 <bring> no
11:43:09 <bring> on freenode?
11:43:12 <shapr> yup
11:43:25 <bring> I'll try it now...
11:43:28 <Lunar^> bring: side effect --> after a disconnect, someone trying to execute a query will go through a deadlock
11:43:44 <bring> with the current code?
11:44:16 <Lunar^> bring: yes
11:44:34 <Lunar^> bring: better a deadlock than a segfault, I think
11:45:46 <bring> are you looking at the code in src/HSQL/MySQL.hsc or MySQL/HSQL.hsc?
11:46:13 <Lunar^> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/htoolkit/HSQL/MySQL/HSQL.hsc <-- this file
11:47:42 <bring> that's old, but unfortunately still in the repository
11:47:51 <bring> will give you the right link in 5 sec
11:48:50 <bring> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/htoolkit/HSQL/src/HSQL/MySQL.hsc
11:48:59 <bring> sorry about that
11:49:32 <Lunar^> damn
11:49:39 <Lunar^> 2 weeks ago is old ?!
11:49:43 <bring> yep
11:49:51 <bring> so very old
11:49:52 <bring> hehe
11:50:08 <bring> there's been a lot of work done the last few weeks
11:50:22 <bring> including a big redesign
11:50:29 <Lunar^> ok
11:51:26 <Lunar^> urgggg
11:53:26 <Lunar^> bring: Where could I put my QSem then ?
11:53:44 <Lunar^> bring: last times I changed the newtype to bring a tuple
11:54:48 <bring> Lunar^: which functions need to use it?
11:57:05 <Lunar^> bring: the function to protect is mysql_query
11:57:22 <Lunar^> I think
11:57:22 <Lunar^> Let me see
11:57:30 <bring> ok
11:58:58 <bring> you could add the semaphore as an extra argument to the functions that need it
11:59:33 <bring> create it in connect and pass it to all the functions that need it when the Connection is created
12:00:02 <Lunar^> http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/mysql_query.html
12:00:30 <Lunar^> CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC <-- this is what's wrong when doing concurrent access
12:00:44 <Lunar^> You need to use store_result before another query
12:06:24 <Lunar^> Ok I see now
12:06:30 <Lunar^> the Connection record is given to the driver
12:06:50 <Lunar^> I don't know for commit and rollback though
12:17:34 <shapr> pilsnermannen: don't drink and shoot ;-)
12:19:50 <shapr> bring: should I look for new sources on http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~d00bring/haskell-xml-rpc/ ?
12:20:01 <pilsnermannen> shapr :-)
12:20:03 <bring> in a few minutes
12:20:19 <shapr> no hurry, I probably won't have time to play with it today.
12:21:39 <bring> compiling test programs right now, takes forever to link, need more RAM
12:21:48 <shapr> how much do you have?
12:22:22 <bring> 128 in the machine, another 128 that I should put in, but then I'd have to reboot :)
12:22:30 <shapr> :-)
12:22:34 <shapr> how fast is your pc?
12:23:50 <bring> 500 MHz athlon, used to be 750 but CPU died had to use an old one 
12:24:14 <bring> my laptop is actually faster than the desktop that I'm using now
12:24:40 <Lunar^> I just noticed that I had a problem with my implementation
12:24:53 <Lunar^> But it never happened since now
12:26:32 <shapr> bring: @yow is M-x yow in emacs
12:26:35 <shapr> @yow
12:26:35 <lambdabot> I want the presidency so bad I can already taste the hors d'oeuvres.
12:26:39 <shapr> @arr
12:26:39 <lambdabot> I'd like to drop me anchor in her lagoon
12:26:46 <shapr> @listmodules
12:26:47 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]
12:27:05 <shapr> @listcommands quote
12:27:06 <lambdabot> Module quote provides the following commands: ["fortune","yow","arr"]
12:30:12 <esap> hmm.. how can I write the equivalent of this: data LeftAdj f a = (Adjunction g f) => LeftAdj (g a)? f and g determine each other uniquely.
12:30:25 <Lunar^> strange
12:30:39 <Lunar^> list_tables doesn't seem to call {use,store}_result
12:31:19 <Lunar^> ok... but it also needs a mutex anyway
12:33:08 <shapr> esap: fundeps?
12:33:43 <esap> shapr: the Adjunction type class uses fundeps for the uniqueness. But the above thing doesn't work, since g is not in scope.
12:34:48 <esap> hmm.. maybe this: data LeftAdj f a = LeftAdj (forall g. (Adjunction g f) => g a)
12:35:49 <Lunar^> bring: I think I've finished my changes
12:35:51 <esap> But do the fundeps allow this to be usefully used?
12:36:00 <bring> cool
12:36:24 <bring> can you send the file or a patch against the current CVS?
12:36:54 <Lunar^> bring: I'm doing it
12:38:01 <Lunar^> I didn't try to compile it though
12:38:07 <Lunar^> bring: Do you know how to test it ?
12:38:36 <bring> well, not the semaphore stuff, except to run a few queries and see if it deadlocks :)
12:39:04 <bring> unfortunately, there isn't a testsuite for HSQL
12:39:13 <bring> anyone wanna write one?
12:39:18 <Lunar^> senrt
12:40:25 <shapr> do you have a mock server driver?
12:40:44 <shapr> would make it easier to test stuff.
12:41:02 <shapr> Lunar^: hey, how do I do [1..] in Python? :-)
12:41:12 <Lunar^> shapr: lol
12:41:19 * shapr grins
12:41:22 <Lunar^> Make an iterator ;
12:41:30 <shapr> I think I can't do that in python 2.1
12:41:42 <shapr> oh, I'm thinking generator
12:41:49 <bring> nope
12:41:58 <bring> but it would be nice
12:42:01 <Lunar^> bring: Just try to see if it this compiles and works for a few query
12:42:07 <bring> ok
12:42:09 <Lunar^> bring: put some forkIO around...
12:42:15 <bring> :)
12:42:30 <Lunar^> bring: the biggest change is mysql_store_result instead of mysql_use_result, anyway
12:42:52 <bring> ok
12:43:30 <Lunar^> The whole thing seems a lot safer than the version I'm using
12:43:50 <Lunar^> A lot of wrapper I've written are inside the base interface also
12:45:22 <Lunar^> But... we should look at mysql_thread_* to be fully multi-threaded
12:45:30 <Lunar^> espcially now that the framework support transaction
12:45:44 <shapr> aha, I'd forgotten about range.
12:45:48 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
12:46:14 <Marvin--> evening
12:46:29 <shapr> wassup?
12:46:34 <Marvin--> playing with Lustre
12:46:59 <Marvin--> nifty little language
12:46:59 <Lunar^> shapr: You can do [1..] with range
12:47:07 <shapr> yes, I just realized that.
12:47:27 <shapr> I am amused that I'm mentally having to port from Haskell to Python.
12:47:39 <Lunar^> same for me
12:47:58 <Lunar^> 7 lines of reduce and map combination lately
12:48:36 <Marvin--> I tried to pull that off at Strakt, they screamed at me until I rewrote it so they understood it
12:51:33 <Marvin--> Does this sentence make sense?  "In particular, let P be the encoding of a Haskell program and e be a Haskell expression that evaluates to a value v. If (Q,t) = [| e |] (that is, the encoding of e is a set of clauses Q and a term t), then we want the following to hold:  P, Q |- t = [| v |]"
12:51:42 <Lunar^> bring: There's not a single line about how to handle transaction with threads
12:52:49 <shapr> Marvin--: what sort of code did they not understand? something like zip(range(1,51),blah) ?
12:53:06 <Marvin--> shapr: I don't remember :)
12:53:11 <shapr> aw, too bad
12:53:31 <Marvin--> I think it was in code that we replaced with Twisted later
12:53:38 <Lunar^> bring: Maybe we should put another QSem around begin/commit/rollback
12:53:40 <shapr> I've noticed I can write some rather inscrutable Python code when I'm thinking in Haskell.
12:53:59 <shapr> hey, did you hear about the XmlRpc library for Haskell?
12:54:19 <Marvin--> hey, what do you guys think of the implicit return values thingy?
12:54:32 <shapr> I'm going to move all sorts of stuff out of Zope, and into Haskell services.
12:55:25 <bring> shapr: new haskell-xml-rpc version available, should fix HTTP problems
12:55:29 <shapr> yay!
12:56:14 <shapr> Marvin--: so, P = (Q,t) right?
12:56:18 <shapr> they're the same thing?
12:56:27 <Marvin--> no no, P is the encoding of the whole program
12:56:36 <Marvin--> e is just some expression
12:56:48 <Marvin--> and (Q, t) is the encoding of that expression
12:56:55 <shapr> ok, I see that now.
12:57:05 <Marvin--> e can't be encoded as a simple term because it can be something complex like a let expression
12:57:05 <bring> Lunar^: had to add queryQSem as second argument to execute on lines 99-101 to get it to compile
12:57:16 <shapr> the implicit return values thingy is basically what elisp does, right?
12:57:33 <Marvin--> I wouldn't know, I've never used elisp
12:57:37 <Lunar^> bring: neat :)
12:58:01 <Lunar^> bring: I'm looking about the new error handling code.. no more segfault, wheee :)
12:58:18 <bring> :)
12:59:25 <Lunar^> I'm going to hunt in #mysql tosee if I could get an explaination about transaction and threads
13:02:18 <Marvin--> I really should work on this report but ooh I want to play with Lustre
13:03:10 <Marvin--> any language that has "temporal combinators" *has* to be fun
13:03:31 <Lunar^> bring: Maybe we could set a define when MySQL is > 4.1 to use mysql_{begin/commit/rollback}
13:03:50 <Lunar^> bring: In conjonction with mysql_thread_init and mysql_thread_end it should be good
13:03:57 <bring> sounds good
13:04:14 <Lunar^> bring: Where could we put thread_end though
13:04:30 <bring> what does it do?
13:04:45 <Lunar^> free resources
13:05:03 <bring> when should it be done?
13:05:38 <bring> I mean, after a transaction, after disconnect etc.
13:05:48 <Lunar^> when thread end
13:05:51 * Marvin-- tries to figure out if he's TAed any courses bring has taken
13:06:03 * Lunar^ just discovered GHC 6.2's forkOS, neatg
13:07:24 <Lunar^> bring: Maybe this mean an exception handler than catch ThreadKilled
13:07:34 <Lunar^> bring: But I don't think it's raised everytime
13:08:02 <Lunar^> I would need to test that
13:08:31 <Lunar^> I would need to test that
13:11:40 <Lunar^> I'm dumb
13:12:20 <Lunar^> I just don't now
13:12:29 <Lunar^> We would need a finalizer on thread
13:14:24 <bring> couldn't we have a forkHSQL x = forkIO (x >> mysql_thread_end)
13:14:30 <bring> or something like that
13:14:58 <bring> well, that's very rought pseudo-haskell
13:15:07 <Lunar^> mysql_thread_init >> x >> mysql_thread_end ; yeah... 
13:15:43 <Lunar^> But that needs a change in the HSQL interface, thus it would be useful to see how other databases handle that particular point
13:15:51 <bring> true
13:16:06 <bring> sorry, True :)
13:16:24 <Lunar^> I think this patch is sufficent for untransactional multi-threadde app, and it's better than before :)
13:17:11 * Lunar^ made his contribution to the Greeat Haskell Movement today
13:17:18 <Lunar^> (but now I'm late to see the one I love ;))
13:17:40 <bring> :)
13:17:42 <bring> have fun
13:18:24 <bring> queries still work anyway :)
13:18:33 <Lunar^> good news :)
13:20:37 <bring> tried with forkOS: Fail: user error (RTS not built to support multiple OS threads.)
13:20:52 <bring> I have never used Haskell concurrency before
13:21:38 <Lunar^> I don't think using forkOS will change anything in this particular case
13:21:51 <bring> when using forkIO: where does output from the threads go
13:22:00 <Lunar^> forkOS mostly relates to external IO actions
13:22:03 <Lunar^> bring: output ?
13:22:20 <bring> standard output that is
13:22:28 <bring> stuff I print with purStrLn 
13:22:34 <Lunar^> Same
13:22:47 <bring> it disappears :(
13:22:53 <Lunar^> ??
13:23:35 <Lunar^> Try using hPutStrLn stderr, which is unbuffered by default
13:23:39 <Lunar^> (or change buffer mode)
13:23:52 <bring> that could be it, this works: 
13:24:30 <bring> forkIO (tableInfo db "d3proj_users") >> forkIO (tableInfo db "test_tb1") >> q db
13:24:54 <bring> but this doesn't: forkIO (tableInfo db "d3proj_users") >> forkIO (tableInfo db "test_tb1") >> forkIO (q db)
13:25:29 <Lunar^> bring: tableInfo is not really something to test
13:25:50 <Lunar^> bring: because it uses collectRows in the way
13:26:14 <Lunar^> bring: But maybe I'm saying stupid things
13:26:22 <bring> no, I think you are right
13:26:39 <bring> you mean that we need to have interleaved calls to fetch?
13:27:08 <Lunar^> bring: That's not really a problem in fact now that we use mysql_store_result
13:27:23 <Lunar^> bring: The critical timing is between a call to mysql_query and mysql_store_result
13:27:33 <bring> :)
13:27:42 <Lunar^> bring: If something happens here, you get an OUT_OF_RDER
13:27:48 <bring> oops, sorry, wrong window
13:28:23 <opet> uni/util/uni-util.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_LanguageziHaskellziTHSyntax_'
13:28:30 <opet> Loading package uni-util ... linking ... ghc-6.2: panic! (the `impossible' happened, GHC version 6.2):
13:28:31 <Lunar^> bring: But I don't know exactly how we could *force* that particular point
13:28:34 <opet> oh dear..
13:29:09 <Lunar^> opet: What impossible ?
13:29:14 <bring> opet: you might have old object och interface files laying around
13:29:29 <bring> s/och/or/
13:29:35 <Lunar^> AmigaOS had Guru meditation, GHC has the "impossible"
13:29:57 <Marvin--> And MacOS had "Error #123413" :-)
13:30:01 <opet> bring: yeah, I thought that. but a make clean doesn't sort it out and I compiled ghc a couple of hours ago
13:30:13 <Marvin--> and a cute little bomb, IIRC
13:30:26 <opet> I have two slightly different source trees and only one breaks
13:30:34 <opet> so I guess I'll have to go digging :)
13:31:15 <Lunar^> The prettiest kernel panic of the moment is on Mac OS X though
13:31:31 <Marvin--> oh?
13:31:32 <Lunar^> This nice grey shade and four languages invitation to reboot
13:31:38 <Marvin--> heh
13:32:09 <bring> opet: it seems to be an unknown symbol at link time, which would AFAIK only happen if you changed the source files
13:32:16 <bring> with recompiling some of the code
13:32:28 <bring> otherwise it should be caught when compiling
13:32:48 <Marvin--> node SoFar(X:bool) returns (Y:bool) let Y = if not X then false else (true -> pre Y); tel
13:32:51 <Marvin--> god I love this language
13:33:12 <opet> Dim opet As Confused
13:33:30 <Marvin--> Lustre, synchronous real-time language
13:34:36 <bring> Lunar^: I could put a threadDelay in query
13:34:49 <Marvin--> all variables are actually potentially infinite sequences of variables
13:35:08 <bring> in between mysql_query and mysql_store_result
13:35:15 <Marvin--> if Y = y1,y2,y3,y4,...  then  pre Y = nil,y1,y2,y3,...
13:35:31 <opet> bring: yes, you'd think that wouldn't you? :)
13:37:06 <Lunar^> bring: yeah... testing timing concurrency problem is always difficult IMHO
13:37:27 <bring> opet: I take it that is not the problem then :)
13:37:33 <Lunar^> Got to go.. by all
13:37:40 <bring> good night
13:38:31 <bring> Lunar^: I'll discuss your patch with Krasimir
14:00:40 <shapr> yow
14:02:02 <Riastradh> @yow
14:02:03 <lambdabot> Gibble, Gobble, we ACCEPT YOU ---
14:02:52 <shapr> that bot is nuts.
14:03:01 <bring> shapr: wanna send me your port-number-in-URL patch
14:03:10 <shapr> sure
14:03:25 <shapr> though I gotta rip out all my putStrLn statements first
14:03:46 <yazirian> abba zabba, you mah only frien'.
14:03:49 <shapr> actually, the essence of it is just "c <- uncurry openTCP (case break (':' ==) host of (h,[]) -> (h,80); (h,c:n) -> (h,read n :: Int)) -- yay cheeze!" in the simpleHTTP function
14:04:11 <bring> cheeze?
14:04:45 <shapr> cheezy means to me that it's not an elegant solution, but it does work
14:05:15 <shapr> for example, that doesn't handle urls with multiple colons, it just explodes.
14:05:45 <bring> can you have multiple colons in the authority portion of a URI?
14:05:52 <shapr> you shouldn't
14:05:55 <shapr> doesn't mean you won't get it.
14:05:58 <bring> :)
14:06:34 <shapr> so that code works just enough that I can contact my various Zope servers on their various weird non-80 http ports
14:07:20 <shapr> hi monotonom 
14:07:37 <monotonom> hi
14:07:46 <shapr> and openTCP needs a port arg after the uri, and (toEnum 80) becomes (toEnum port)
14:07:58 <shapr> I think that's the entire patch.
14:08:10 <bring> seems enough, I'll add it
14:08:42 <shapr> I haven't checked to see if it breaks other code in HTTP.hs, I'll check that after I get XmlRpc talking to Zope
14:08:44 <shapr> monotonom: how's code?
14:09:38 <monotonom> what code?
14:09:59 <shapr> any code you've been working on?
14:10:05 <monotonom> No.
14:10:51 <shapr> it's sort of like "how's life?"
14:10:58 <monotonom> Hahaha
14:11:06 <shapr> oh, life's rough when there's no time for code :-)
14:11:22 <monotonom> Quite right.
14:11:53 <shapr> I really like being paid to write code.
14:13:08 <bring> is there a function readM :: (Read a,Monad m) => String -> m a
14:13:23 <shapr> @type readM
14:13:24 <Marvin--> bring: return . read ? :)
14:13:29 <bring> basically read, but calls fail instead of error
14:13:31 <Riastradh> @type read
14:13:32 <lambdabot> read :: Read a => String -> a
14:13:32 <Marvin--> oh
14:13:48 <monotonom> I do not entirely like that. A consequence of getting paid is that the choice of programming methods and tools is somewhat inferiorly limited.
14:14:14 <bring> easy enough to write, but I like to use library functions :)
14:14:21 <Marvin--> monotonom: shapr has the advantage of paying himself to code ;)
14:14:52 <shapr> yes, I'm self-employed. So if my client asks me to write a web application in assembly, I can just laugh and walk away.
14:14:56 <monotonom> Ah haha that's neat.
14:14:59 <shapr> and starve :-)
14:15:05 <Marvin--> there is that :)
14:15:44 <shapr> I've found the balance of happiness and eating by building websites with Python.
14:15:58 <monotonom> A general readM as bring has specified would be nice.
14:16:13 <bring> I'll just go write one then :)
14:16:32 <Marvin--> eh, the fail function is pretty limited anyway
14:16:42 * Marvin-- prefers using an exception monad
14:17:12 <bring> but if you are using an exception monad, fail will fail in that monad, right?
14:17:43 <Marvin--> not if you're just using ErrorT
14:18:11 <Marvin--> or so I think
14:20:00 <shapr> Marvin--: I rather liked David Sankel's reply to the Implicit parameters redux message.
14:20:27 <Marvin--> shapr: yeah, I was wondering if I'd dare write something like that myself :)
14:20:38 <Marvin--> "sounds cool... but..."
14:20:42 * phubuh completely failed to understand that implicit parameters stuff
14:21:08 <Marvin--> I didn't even know that linear implicit parameters existed, I only knew about the ordinary ones
14:21:12 <phubuh> well, I thought I understood it, but then came the grand claims
14:21:31 <Marvin--> where's the Splittable class defined anyway?
14:22:28 <shapr> right, here it is - http://haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2004-January/013499.html
14:22:56 <shapr> I vaguely understand implicit parameters.
14:24:19 <bring> Marvin--: had a look at the library sources ErrorT, looks like it's using fail, but I'm sure I'm wrong
14:25:22 <shapr> yay!  "To log all HTTP traffic to a file, edit src/HTTP.hs and set debug to True."
14:25:28 <bring> :)
14:25:44 <bring> you can even set the filename :)
14:25:49 <shapr> ooh
14:25:50 * shapr tries
14:26:09 <Marvin--> bring: well, yes and no, the fail definition of Monad (ErrorT e m) uses throwError, but a lifted fail won't...
14:27:25 <bring> hmm, ok
14:27:51 <bring> maybe it would be better to have a maybeRead then
14:27:58 <bring> less room for that sort of thing
14:29:02 <bring> guess that that's just listToMaybe . map fst . reads
14:29:05 <bring> or something
14:29:51 <shapr> w000!
14:29:53 <shapr> it WORKS!
14:29:57 <bring> sweet
14:30:01 * shapr bounces energetically
14:30:29 <bring> thanks for making me fix it
14:30:38 <shapr> hah, thanks for writing it :-)
14:30:56 <bring> first time I ever have anyone giving me a bug report for anything I write
14:30:57 <shapr> now I can write half of my work code in Haskell
14:31:08 <andersca> bring: get used to it :)
14:31:09 <andersca> um
14:31:19 <andersca> I mean, if you write buggy code that is
14:31:27 <bring> haha
14:31:27 <shapr> you're a developer on HSQL and HaskellDB too, right?
14:31:33 <bring> yeah
14:31:53 <bring> but most people just never seem to contact the developer
14:31:54 <shapr> ok, you'll probably get lots of bugs from me, and I'm sure some of them will be user error.
14:31:59 <bring> :)
14:32:18 <andersca> phubuh: btw, how goes the d-bus bindings? :)
14:32:40 <phubuh> I thought about it for a bit, and then I didn't do it
14:33:10 * shapr bounces happily
14:33:20 <phubuh> I had a GNOME post-it note on my desktop that said "bind d-bus to haskell", but I switched to ratpoison.  that's probably why!
14:33:36 <andersca> phubuh: I have some really neat ideas for integrating D-BUS with .NET
14:33:53 <Marvin--> eep.
14:33:59 <phubuh> oh, cool.  let's hear it, maybe I'll get some ideas :-)
14:34:23 <andersca> the idea is that you have this interface declaration
14:34:35 <andersca> with the functions you'd like to call
14:34:45 <andersca> and then you can create a proxy object of that type automatically
14:34:52 <shapr> if you have a GHCi handy with XmlRpc imported, 'remote "http://shapr.homelinux.net:9673/" "pyhello" "your name"'
14:34:56 <andersca> emitting bytecode to marshal and demarshal code
14:35:30 <Marvin--> idea: you could use inifinite lists linear implicit parameters to get infinite name supplies
14:36:33 <bring> shapr: does that work? I'd have thought that is to polymorphic to actually do anything
14:36:44 <shapr> try it.
14:36:50 <bring> ok
14:36:51 <Marvin--> something like  split (x1:x2:xs) = let (ys,zs) = split xs in (x1:ys, x2:zs)   and  let %uniq = [1..] in ... %uniq ... %uniq ...
14:37:03 <phubuh> andersca: do you mean the objects would be generated in runtime?
14:37:18 <Marvin--> er, head %uniq that is
14:37:46 <andersca> phubuh: yeah
14:37:46 <shapr> bring: works?
14:37:56 <Marvin--> that's pretty nifty, actually
14:38:12 <phubuh> andersca: that's neat.  would it be hard to implement with mono?
14:38:59 <bring> hmm, my hacking on HTTP.hs has screwed it up
14:39:01 <bring> hold on
14:39:01 <Marvin--> beats using a reader monad
14:39:14 <shapr> what about "do {x <- remote "http://shapr.homelinux.net:9673/" "pyhello" "Haskell"; putStrLn x }" ?
14:39:32 <andersca> phubuh: not at all
14:39:46 <phubuh> cool
14:39:48 <Riastradh> What does % do?
14:40:13 <phubuh> Riastradh: it fetches an implicit parameter, IIRC
14:40:20 <shapr> if the port parsing code doesn't work for you, I can send you  diffs against your latest online tarball.
14:40:20 <Riastradh> ...which is...?
14:40:39 <phubuh> beats me :-) it's not implemented yet, but it's being discussed on haskell-cafe
14:40:58 <shapr> I think implicit params already exist
14:41:06 <shapr> but whatever this guy is talking about loses me.
14:41:10 <phubuh> oh.
14:41:16 <shapr> http://haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2004-January/013495.html
14:41:33 <shapr> that's the summary of the confusing thing.
14:41:38 <Marvin--> Riastradh: %foo are linear implicit parameters, ?foo are "regular" implicit parameters
14:41:47 <shapr> oh
14:42:06 <Marvin--> Riastradh: if %foo is an instance of Splittable, then the split :: a -> (a,a) function is used to mutate the parameter in subexpressions, or so I guess
14:42:28 <Riastradh> ...er, what are Splittable and split?
14:42:32 <bring> shapr: works!
14:42:35 <shapr> yay!
14:42:43 <Marvin--> class Splittable where split :: a -> (a,a)  it's in GHC.Exts
14:42:45 <shapr> much happiness.
14:43:06 <shapr> time-xmlrpc-com works now too
14:43:24 <bring> I'll just forget about the possibility of horribly malformed URIs for now'
14:43:38 <shapr> that's probably a good idea.
14:44:06 <Marvin--> http://sjogren.ost.sgsnet.se:8080/Uniq.hs
14:44:24 <shapr> I'd probably stick in a comment there saying "will explode on authorities with two colons" or something
14:45:09 <shapr> so, I wonder sort of buglist I can accumulate running QuickCheck via xmlrpc against Zope
14:45:19 <Marvin--> shapr: ow, evil
14:45:26 * shapr grins evilly
14:45:34 <phubuh> Marvin--: wow, that compiles?
14:45:46 <Marvin--> phubuh: works fine in ghci
14:45:56 <bring> actually, it crashes for anything after the colon that is not an integer
14:45:58 <Marvin--> *Uniq> test
14:45:58 <Marvin--> (1,2)
14:46:03 <phubuh> that's very cool
14:46:07 * phubuh plays
14:46:08 <shapr> right, that too.
14:46:16 <shapr> ok, two conditions kill that hack
14:46:29 <shapr> actually, it's the same condition
14:46:30 <shapr> whatever
14:46:52 * shapr confuses himself
14:46:56 <bring> I think I'll just fix it, easier thatn documenting it
14:47:02 <shapr> heh, ok
14:47:39 <Marvin--> meh, I think I'm going to have to have a talk with Koen about "open source"
14:47:45 <shapr> ?
14:47:52 <shapr> I hope he likes open source.
14:47:58 <shapr> I ripped off his code recently.
14:48:00 <Marvin--> I want the source code for the lustre tool he wrote for the formal methods course :P
14:48:22 <Marvin--> I want to know how the theorem proving part of it works
14:48:38 <shapr> oh, I want Koen's shrink code.
14:48:55 <shapr> I wish they'd get it together and release QuickCheckII.hs
14:49:08 <Marvin--> apparently we're going to talk about "temporal induction" next week
14:49:15 <Marvin--> yeah, the shrink code is nifty
14:49:31 <Marvin--> I have a copy of some of it here but I'm not sure I should hand it out left and right
14:49:40 <shapr> yah, I agree.
14:50:51 <shapr> sooo... should I work, write some LIP code, or write an email indexer for haskell mailing lists?
14:50:52 * phubuh is not sure if he likes this implicit parameters stuff...
14:51:59 <Marvin--> phubuh: why? it's like having a reader monad, but without the monad
14:52:56 <phubuh> let %foo = bar in baz + baz can be entirely different from let %foo = bar in baz * 2, which doesn't feel right, but that may be because I don't understand this magic yet :-)
14:53:18 <Marvin--> of course it can be entirely different
14:53:41 <Marvin--> baz + baz  being the same as  baz * 2  already depends on the implementation of + and * ;)
14:53:45 <shapr> where's LIP's arch repo again?
14:54:02 <phubuh> oh you know what I mean :-)
14:54:19 <Riastradh> arch?  Bah!
14:54:49 <Marvin--> seriously, you have the same thing with a reader monad, but then you'd compare   liftM2 (+) baz baz  and  liftM (*2) baz  instead
14:54:56 <shapr> I prefer darcs, but SyntaxNinja gets to use whatever he wants.
14:55:07 <Marvin--> that's 'cuz he's the NINJA
14:55:28 <shapr> ninjas flip out and kill people.
14:55:34 <shapr> ah, here it is - http://www.haskell.org/libraryInfrastructure/code.html
14:55:38 <Marvin--> shapr: heh, yeah
14:55:52 <Marvin--> "all the time"
14:56:01 <Marvin--> god that page was funny
14:56:09 <Riastradh> Be careful not to drop a spoon anywhere near SyntaxNinja!
14:56:39 <phubuh> Marvin--: yeah, but the reader monad makes it explicit what's a "side-effectual" thing and what's pure
14:57:03 <phubuh> ah well, this is just my gut reaction :-)
14:57:45 <Marvin--> phubuh: well, for one thing,   baz + baz  and  baz * 2  will have a type saying e.g. (%foo :: a) => b  rather than just b
14:58:12 <phubuh> yeah
15:00:13 <shapr> ah, here it is - http://realultimatepower.net/
15:01:08 <phubuh> Marvin--: this can't be used to implement, say, State, can it?
15:02:53 <bring> shapr: do you ever need to use XML-RPC arrays and structs with elements of diffrent types?
15:03:34 <Marvin--> phubuh: no, just reader, as Ben says
15:03:56 <phubuh> ah, I should read that again :)
15:03:57 <Marvin--> and implicit return values can implement writer
15:04:28 <phubuh> yeah
15:04:40 <bring> is it ok to use a service name instead of a port number in a URI
15:04:52 <bring> like: http://host:http/
15:05:16 <bring> guess I should look at the RFC
15:05:18 <Marvin--> not that I know of
15:05:34 <Marvin--> would be pretty silly
15:05:53 <Riastradh> bring, um, why wouldn't you just leave it at http://host/?
15:06:17 <Marvin--> you'd have  http://host:ssh/  and it just looks confusing
15:06:20 <bring> ok, my example was stupid, but say you had: telnet:/host:http/
15:06:46 <bring> it is silly, but it sounds like the sort of thing that could make it into a standard
15:06:56 <shapr> I would assume I would need structs of different types, would tuples work?
15:07:50 <phubuh> bring: I think only digits are allowed in the port.
15:09:08 <ludde> bring: hello
15:09:20 <bring> shapr: see, the thing is, I have not yet come up with a clean way of representing heterogenous arrays and structs
15:09:26 <bring> ludde: hello
15:09:30 <ludde> :)
15:09:49 <shapr> man, you guys could easily start #chalmers or #goteborg
15:09:54 <ludde> hehe
15:10:02 <shapr> bring: I haven't come up with a clean way to do that either.
15:10:06 <bring> you guys are right: "port          = *digit" from RFC 2396
15:10:08 <phubuh> I thought that's what #haskell.se was :P
15:10:13 <shapr> oh, right
15:10:15 <shapr> of course
15:10:47 <Marvin--> don't start #chalmers, andersca and I would have to start #gu just to spite you :(
15:11:11 <bring> I considered tuples, but then you'd get some fixed upper limit on the size
15:11:50 <shapr> much like that colon hack, I can deal with limited size when I get there.
15:11:58 <shapr> hi gebner
15:12:01 <shapr> looking for Haskell info?
15:12:05 * Riastradh prods shapr at #darcs.
15:12:08 <bring> true, I have fixed the colon thing though
15:12:11 <gebner> no, just lurking
15:12:29 <bring> *XmlRpcClient> remote "http://shapr.homelinux.net:apa/" "pyhello" "Bjorn" >>= putStrLn
15:12:34 <bring> *** Exception: user error (Weird port number: 'apa')
15:12:42 <shapr> ooh, spiffy
15:12:57 <bring> guess I should make another release :)
15:13:01 <shapr> yay!
15:13:13 <bring> after all, it's after midnight, so it'll have a new date on ite 
15:13:16 * shapr laughs
15:13:30 <shapr> of course, that means you can't make a release tomorrow, but I guess you'll survive.
15:13:37 <Marvin--> why the hell do people keep making movies longer than three hours?
15:13:44 <bring> aha, you're right
15:13:49 <shapr> so they can charge for restrooms
15:13:52 <ludde> there's always a possibility to fake the date also
15:14:00 <Riastradh> Marvin--, because if not, they lose too much story?
15:14:07 <ludde> you could make a new release that's older than a previous release
15:14:13 <bring> :)
15:14:14 <ludde> (in terms of the date)
15:14:18 <ludde> :)
15:14:21 <bring> that wouldn't be confusing at all
15:14:23 <shapr> mmm, http://www.cafeshops.com/realninja/149
15:14:32 <ludde> not at all =)
15:14:45 <shapr> oh no, of course not.
15:15:24 <mattam> Marvin--: do you think is is systematic ?
15:16:41 <Marvin--> I dunno
15:16:53 <Marvin--> but I noticed a new Swedish movie that's over three hours long
15:17:05 <Marvin--> I just think it's way too long to sit in a chair in a cinema
15:17:27 <shapr> oh, I saw my first Carlton Hamilton episode recently, wow!
15:17:42 <Marvin--> Carlton?? You mean Carl?
15:17:53 <shapr> ok, I only saw one episode :-P
15:18:08 <Marvin--> "Sweden's James Bond"
15:18:14 <shapr> right him, he's cool.
15:19:01 * phubuh doesn't know what that is :/
15:19:18 <Marvin--> phubuh: a series of silly books written by Jan Guillo
15:19:57 <phubuh> ah
15:20:16 <shapr> he wrote that too?
15:20:43 <shapr> I just finish reading the lÃ¤ttlÃ¤ttlÃ¤st of Ondskan(?)
15:21:04 <bring> new release out now, codename HjortskinnsbyXoR
15:21:12 * shapr snickers
15:21:17 <Marvin--> Ondskan is pretty much the only good thing he's written as far as I'm concerned :P
15:21:36 <Marvin--> byXOR
15:21:48 <shapr> sorry, I think XOR is patented.
15:22:03 <Marvin--> dang
15:22:18 * shapr grins
15:23:39 <shapr> bring: so, you think XmlRpc is readdy for announcing now?
15:23:46 <shapr> "ready"
15:23:58 <shapr> eesh, I can't spell my own language.
15:24:09 <bring> well, if it works for you
15:24:11 <bring> :)
15:26:11 <shapr> it works!
15:26:18 <bring> just tested XmlRpc it in hugs, it works
15:26:27 <bring> didn't think it did
15:26:30 <shapr> I didn't know hugs had network support.
15:26:39 <shapr> I also thought that HaXml had hugs problems.
15:26:42 <bring> guess it does :)
15:26:51 <bring> HaXml 1.10 works with hugs
15:29:07 <bring> I would like to have someone test XmlRpc in Windows, but Windows users are hard to find
15:29:13 <bring> they don't admit that they are
15:29:54 <shapr> some people here use windows.
15:30:17 <bring> :) hope I didn't offend anyone
15:30:57 <shapr> I stopped using windows some years ago.
15:31:35 <shapr> but I'm glab Haskell works on win32, since I may write apps for clients that way sometime.
15:31:38 <shapr> glad
15:31:54 <shapr> ick, I can't spell. swedish classes are scrambling my brains!
15:32:14 <bring> shapr: where are you from?
15:32:20 <shapr> Alabama
15:32:24 <shapr> where are you from?
15:32:30 <bring> Sweden
15:32:37 <shapr> any particular part of Sweden?
15:33:07 <bring> so, you are taking Swedish classes just to talk to talk to all the cool swedish haskell hackers?
15:33:16 <bring> well, all over
15:33:18 <Marvin--> no, because he's living here :P
15:33:30 <bring> oh, makes more sense :)
15:33:49 <Marvin--> where "here" is Boden
15:33:52 <shapr> I live in Boden, my only experience with southern swedes is drinking with Marvin-- 
15:34:21 <bring> what brings you to Boden?
15:35:49 <shapr> there was this woman... (50,000 words omitted) ... and now I live it Boden.
15:36:14 <shapr> "in Boden" sheesh
15:36:48 <shapr> what brings you to GÃ¶teborg? :)
15:36:59 <bring> Chalmers :)
15:37:15 <bring> well, I've lived here on and off since '95
15:38:36 <bring> how long have you lived in Sweden?
15:38:52 <shapr> I've been in Boden for 1.5 years, I think.
15:39:41 <shapr> I really like Boden, it's a great place to live.
15:40:12 <bring> you ok with the perpetual darkness?
15:40:27 <shapr> swedish classes for one year, three months; as part of the Swedish for Invaders program.
15:40:35 <bring> :)
15:40:56 <shapr> I lived in finland for three years before this, so I've sort of gotten used to it.
15:41:33 <bring> how come you moved to Finland?
15:42:15 <Marvin--> *lol* these Nick Burns sketches on SNL are really good
15:42:45 <shapr> I was living in Seattle, I met this woman on ICQ, a month later, I moved back to Birmingham, she came to visit me for a month, it was great, we moved to Tornio (just outside of Haparanda) where she had been living for a year or so.
15:43:35 <shapr> have you lived outside of Sweden?
15:43:47 <bring> Ireland and California
15:43:50 <shapr> wow, neat!
15:44:08 <shapr> I lived just outside of San Diego for a bit, where did you live?
15:44:11 * phubuh hasn't ever even left the country
15:44:39 <phubuh> (not counting a brief excursion into Norway when my dad misread the map)
15:44:44 <shapr> haha
15:44:48 <bring> San Luis Obispo, small town on the Central Coast
15:45:00 <shapr> famous for its monasteries and swallows.
15:45:10 <bring> Norway?
15:45:15 <shapr> no, san luis obispo
15:45:41 <bring> hmm, can't remember any of those
15:45:45 <shapr> phubuh: so, you'll come visit me when I move back to the USA for a few years vacation?
15:45:50 <bring> well, I guess there was a mission
15:46:12 <phubuh> shapr: that'd be fun
15:46:26 <shapr> why were you in California?
15:46:42 <shapr> phubuh: except that Alabama isn't really the cultural capital of the USA
15:46:46 <phubuh> maybe then I'll be old enough to have some beer with you :-)
15:46:56 <shapr> probably so
15:47:03 <bring> studied a year at Cal Poly in SLO
15:47:06 <shapr> only four years, right?
15:47:10 <bring> exchange with Chalmers
15:47:15 <phubuh> no, I'm way older than that
15:47:17 <phubuh> ;-P
15:47:35 <shapr> how old do you have to be to drink in sweden?
15:47:42 <bring> 18 in a bar
15:47:46 <bring> 20 in a store
15:47:53 <bring> well, you can't drink in the store
15:47:54 <shapr> I think it's 21 in the USA
15:47:57 <shapr> hah
15:48:00 <phubuh> haha
15:48:19 <shapr> phubuh: how old are you now?
15:48:25 <shapr> I thought you were 15?
15:48:26 <phubuh> still fifteen
15:48:29 <phubuh> yup.
15:48:53 <shapr> right, and I'm old enough to not remember the drinking age in the US anymore.
15:49:03 <phubuh> haha
15:49:20 <shapr> bring: so, did you like Cal Poly?
15:49:34 <bring> really nice place
15:49:52 <bring> esp the people and the climate
15:50:12 <shapr> sunnier than sweden
15:50:20 <bring> you can say that again
15:50:32 <bring> went to the beach in January
15:50:50 * phubuh is getting quite fed up with swedish winters
15:50:50 <bring> (though the water is fscking freezing all year)
15:51:05 <shapr> yah, swedish winters are dark and depressing.
15:51:18 <shapr> but I have my sunner emacs color-theme
15:51:22 <shapr> er "sunny"
15:51:39 <Riastradh> It sounds like I'd like Swedish winters.
15:51:46 * Marvin-- really hates winters in Gothenburg
15:51:51 <shapr> you get to stay inside a lot.
15:52:05 <bring> yeah, that's nice
15:52:15 <shapr> it was down to -27Â°C here for a few days recently.
15:52:15 <phubuh> not if you have school to attend
15:52:20 <bring> Riastradh: where are you from?
15:52:24 <bring> true
15:52:28 <Riastradh> bring, New England.
15:52:47 <bring> well, your winters can be pretty nasty too, can't they?
15:53:20 <Marvin--> this city has way too high humidity, feels a lot colder than it really is
15:53:28 <Riastradh> They _can_ be, but they typically aren't.
15:54:22 <bring> hey, you guys are keeping my up all night, I had made serious plans to sleep at some point today
15:54:28 <bring> s/my/me/
15:54:31 <shapr> good idea!
15:54:34 <phubuh> there's an idea
15:54:43 <shapr> thanks for dropping by and fixing code!
15:54:49 <Riastradh> Sleep?  What's that?
15:55:07 <bring> it's 1 am over here :)
15:55:37 <shapr> I should go back to work.
15:55:44 <bring> thanks for getting me to come here
15:55:53 * shapr points at andersca 
15:56:22 <shapr> I'm looking forward to HaskellDB on ghc, that'll rock.
15:56:31 <bring> yeah, conny told me andersca said someone had asked for me
15:56:46 <Marvin--> bring: eh, you get a new today every 24 hours, who cares :)
15:57:26 <shapr> who's conny? another gbg irc person?
15:57:31 <bring> well true, but that new today is going to suck if I'll have to get up while I'm still sleeping
15:57:50 <shapr> yes, sleep is an investment in the next day's consciousness.
15:58:01 <bring> some stupid workmen started drilling in the next apartment at 7 am this morning
15:58:13 <Marvin--> guh
15:58:17 <Marvin--> that really sucks
15:58:24 <bring> why do they always have to do that 7-8 am and not the rest of the day?
15:58:43 <Marvin--> beats me
15:58:50 <shapr> I think they only do that if they know programmers are in the house.
15:58:58 <bring> haha
15:59:02 <shapr> and it's just for revenge because we can work whenever we want :-)
15:59:03 <Marvin--> that could very well be true
15:59:11 <bring> andersca, is conny on irc?
15:59:38 <bring> he's in the HaskllDB project anyway
16:00:46 <shapr> mmm, alpha release sooon
16:01:06 <bring> you should come to our release party on tuesday night :)
16:01:33 <shapr> I'll wait for the bug party that weekend ;-)
16:02:04 <bring> just hope we don't get so drunk we forget to release it
16:02:16 <shapr> it would be cool to have occasional gbg hackfests
16:02:31 <shapr> we could do it in Marvin--'s place :-P
16:03:11 <shapr> do you ever have that sort of event in gbg?
16:03:46 <phubuh> is it specified if [a | a <- [1, 2]] is [1, 2] or [2, 1]?
16:04:12 <shapr> would the list monad always give [1,2] ?
16:04:13 <bring> dunno, do we?
16:04:16 <Riastradh> It's [1,2].  Why would it be [2,1]?
16:04:31 <Marvin--> in my place? I live in a frickin' dorm room :(
16:04:42 <shapr> well, if you have a hub...
16:04:46 <phubuh> I don't know, maybe the compiler found it convenient
16:05:03 <bring> I've got an apartment in the city center, you can all come here and hack
16:05:11 <Marvin--> phubuh: it's a list comprehension, not a set comprehension, of course it's ordered
16:05:14 <shapr> that would be spiffy
16:05:31 <phubuh> oh, duh, it'd be pretty useless if it wasn't
16:05:32 <bring> not that big, but I've got a 10 MBit line 
16:05:34 <phubuh> I really need sleep
16:05:41 <shapr> w00, bandwidth
16:05:55 <Marvin--> do you have wlan? I wanna try out my wlan card :P
16:06:02 <bring> yeah
16:06:14 <Marvin--> (though if CDG is to be trusted, I should be able to use the campus wlan tomorrow)
16:06:26 <bring> that works for me anyway
16:06:45 <bring> but they have annoying web-authentication
16:06:56 <Marvin--> turned out that while my account was properly in CDKS and my name was properly in the PDB, the name and account were connected *sigh*
16:07:10 <Marvin--> er, weren't
16:07:13 <shapr> telia's web-authentication is annoying too
16:07:27 <bring> yeah, I just end up scripting them
16:07:33 <shapr> you have a telia script?
16:07:44 <bring> used to, back when I had telia
16:07:54 <Marvin--> do you have a nomad script? :)
16:08:17 <bring> yeah, but I'll have to fire up the laptop, hold on
16:08:21 <shapr> aha, http://k76.ryd.student.liu.se/telia-adsl-linux.html
16:08:29 <shapr> google found such a thing
16:08:42 * Marvin-- fires up his laptop too
16:09:15 <shapr> obviously I should rewrite this using HTTP.hs
16:09:31 <bring> good idea
16:10:18 <bring> I haven't tried my script for a couple of months, haven't brought the laptop to Chalmers for a while
16:10:38 <Marvin--> I doubt they've changed it
16:14:40 * shapr thinks bring is sleeping on the laptop
16:15:04 <bring> http://bringert.net/misc/nomad_login
16:15:28 <bring> what? me? I wasn't sleeping. I was just resting my eyes
16:15:33 * shapr grins
16:16:18 <shapr> well, if you're not going to sleep, how did you get to Ireland?
16:16:25 <bring> the script only authenticates if the SSID is NOMAD
16:16:50 <bring> that means you can run it everytime wlan0 gets an IP
16:16:56 <bring> that what I do anyway
16:17:25 <bring> it was back in 1999, went there to work for a while
16:17:42 * Marvin-- ponders where to stick to script to have it run automagically when a dhcp lease is obtained
16:18:17 <bring> I'm a Mandrake wuss, but /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup.d/
16:18:20 <bring> works for me
16:18:54 <shapr> I've heard Marvin-- uses debian.
16:18:54 <Marvin--> hm
16:18:56 <shapr> @arr
16:18:57 <lambdabot> Arrr!
16:19:01 <bring> haha
16:19:15 * shapr grins
16:19:47 <shapr> are you working on Haskell projects other than XmlRpc and HaskellDB?
16:20:20 <bring> just random hacks and projects for school
16:20:39 <bring> nothing serious
16:21:15 <bring> well, HSQL I guess, but that's just because we need it for HaskellDB
16:21:22 <shapr> lambdabot is the most serious thing I've worked on.
16:21:26 <Riastradh> How about major silly things?
16:21:27 <Marvin--> so files in ifup.d (or if-up.d as it's called in Debian) are called with the interface as argument?
16:22:02 <bring> I think so, but I had to look in ifup to find that out
16:22:44 <Marvin--> hm, the man page for the interfaces file says "with no arguments"
16:22:49 <bring> I'm new to irc, what does a bot do (except say silly things)
16:23:12 <bring> ok, I guess it could do anything
16:23:22 <shapr> @listmodules
16:23:22 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","dict","dummy","dynamic","eval","hello","karma","more","quote","seen","state","system","topic","type"]

16:23:47 <lambdabot>    or {MUD} user who is actually a program. On IRC, typically the robot
16:23:47 <lambdabot>    provides some useful service. Examples are NickServ, which tries to
16:23:48 <lambdabot>    prevent random users from adopting {nick}s already claimed by others,
16:23:50 <lambdabot>    and MsgServ, which allows one to send asynchronous messages to be
16:23:52 <lambdabot>    delivered when the recipient signs on. Also common are `annoybots', such
16:23:54 <lambdabot>    as KissServ, which perform no useful function except to send cute

16:25:34 <bring> what does it do for the non-terminating stuff
16:25:39 <Riastradh> That.
16:25:41 <bring> ah, ok
16:25:42 <Riastradh> @resume
16:25:45 <shapr> Darius wrote the EvalModule
16:25:46 <Marvin--> though wait, I could just stick 'up ~/nomad_login' in the config stanza for wlan0
16:26:02 <phubuh> I'm working on a module to detect non-terminating algorithms before it tries to evaluate them, so hopefully that'll be more graceful soon
16:26:07 <shapr> it's very nifty, it uses the modular interpreters via monad transformers ideas
16:26:16 <lambdabot> out of fuel - use @resume to continue
16:27:03 <bring> phubuh: hmm, if that works for any program, you'll be famous
16:27:04 <shapr> part of the fun of lambdabot is that so many modules have been written by different people.
16:27:26 <Riastradh> I wrote a very lame component of lambdabot and never got around to catching up with the rest of lambdabot to hack some more.
16:27:39 <bring> what does it do?
16:27:43 <Riastradh> @karma bring
16:27:44 <phubuh> bring: it already does!  it can already detect the non-terminatability of the program "1".  where's my fame?

16:28:14 <bring> ?
16:28:18 <Riastradh> @karma+ Riastradh
16:28:18 <lambdabot> You can't change your own karma, silly.
16:28:26 <Riastradh> See how lame it is?
16:28:35 <bring> :)
16:28:42 <shapr> Pseudonym wrote lambdabot, and included a HelloModule
16:29:01 <Riastradh> It was really just an exercise for me to see if I could figure out how to write a lambdabot module, a skill that vanished and never ended up being useful.
16:29:07 <bring> phubuh: "1"?
16:29:11 <shapr> soon after, I wrote the FactModule that used HSQL to pull stuff from a postgresql database.
16:29:19 <Riastradh> @fact foo
16:29:19 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "fact", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
16:29:37 <shapr> but, rebuilding HSQL each time new debs get installed is a pain.
16:29:40 <phubuh> bring: sorry, lame joke on the ambiguity of "any" :-)
16:29:55 <bring> haha
16:29:59 <bring> good one
16:30:34 <shapr> oh, I found CmafiheModule
16:30:52 <Marvin--> well, I'll be sure to test this tomorrow
16:31:22 <bring> it was a bitch to debug, you might want to run it from the command line the first time
16:31:26 <shapr> polli rewrote lambdabot's module system and turned it into a typeclass
16:31:41 <shapr> Heffalump swapped the whole thing to dynamic loading of modules
16:32:00 <shapr> @listcommands dummy
16:32:00 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy","wiki","learn","moo","det"]
16:32:11 <bring> how is the dynamic module loading done?
16:32:27 <shapr> it uses ozone's Runtime Loader
16:32:40 <shapr> which uses GHCi's code
16:32:52 <bring> doesn't work in Hugs I take it?
16:33:14 <shapr> nope
16:33:18 <bring> too bad
16:33:39 * shapr tries to think of a new command
16:33:55 <bring> I've been looking for a clean way to do dynamic module loading that works in GHC and Hugs
16:34:07 <bring> all I've got is a hasty hack
16:34:58 <shapr> Hampus Ram has extended ozone's runtime loader with some neat features
16:35:22 <shapr> there's still the problem that static modules and dynamic modules can't exchange types
16:35:44 <shapr> or, can't compare types, as I understand it they have different type tables
16:35:59 <bring> ok, sounds reasonable
16:36:27 <shapr> @listcommands dummy
16:36:28 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy","wiki","learn","moo","det"]
16:36:30 <Marvin--> well, I'm off to bed

23:55:12 <jiwon> I've got a simple question.
23:56:10 <jiwon> I'm using hugs, and I read how to define a function
23:56:24 <saz> and...
23:56:36 <jiwon> it's something like, head :: [a] -> a  NEWLINE head (x:xs) = x
23:57:04 <jiwon> when I wrote that to a file and load it from interactive shell, there's no problem
23:57:25 <jiwon> but I don't understand why interactive shell gives me error when I try to type that in the shell.
23:57:48 <saz> you can't
23:58:11 <jiwon> um, could you give me more information on that?
23:58:34 <saz> you can't define functions in your interactive shell
23:58:41 <saz> you have to type them in an editor and load/reload them
23:58:52 <jiwon> hmm...
23:58:58 <saz> (unlike, say python)
23:59:09 <jiwon> yeah.., I'm from python. :)
23:59:18 * saz knew haskell before python
23:59:26 <saz> so i found that kinda neat
