02:13:10 <ludde> :)
02:13:12 <cm> :(
02:36:23 <andersca> you scared him off!
03:26:52 <Darius> "If you see the material in terms of passing examinations, then it is, let us face it, just one shitload of integrals."
03:29:50 <bring> haha
03:31:19 <esap> That's nice way of discouraging anyone that wants to get quick profit without the work
04:04:50 <andersca> hello chucky_
04:04:52 <andersca> chucky_: #haskell.se
05:08:19 <swisscheese> Greetings - anyone up for an H newbie question?
05:09:20 <andersca> just go ahead and ask
05:09:50 <swisscheese> I am trying to build a tree of board positions reachable by a sequence of moves such that no new position already exists in the tree. I have the data type, the function that maps a position to all new positions one move away, and a search function that determines if a position is indeed new. The brain block comes from trying to pass the ROOT of the tree to the search function. What's the trick?
05:13:32 <Igloo> What are the types of the functions you have so far?
05:14:33 <swisscheese> data Tree = Node Puzzle [Tree]
05:14:34 <swisscheese> solution :: Puzzle -> Tree
05:14:34 <swisscheese> newPuzzles :: Tree -> Puzzle -> [Puzzle]
05:14:34 <swisscheese> treeHasPuzzle :: Puzzle -> Tree -> Bool
05:17:14 <Igloo> What's a Puzzle?
05:17:23 <swisscheese> A board position
05:18:14 <Igloo> Don't you just need to make a Puzzle corresponding to the root? OAIC?
05:18:57 <swisscheese> No - I start from an initial positon and than make moves to reach new positions. I want the tree of reachable new positions.
05:19:36 <Igloo> Where position = Puzzle?
05:19:43 <swisscheese> yes
05:25:46 * Darius is amazed that he can make sense of the alphabet soup Igloo uses.
05:27:37 <Igloo> ?
05:27:59 <swisscheese> What does ? mean?
05:28:15 <Igloo> It means "What do you mean, Darius?"
05:28:30 <Darius> OAIC, OOI, IIRC, etc.
05:28:45 <swisscheese> OK, so what is OAIC?
05:28:45 <Igloo> Pah, all standard acronyms  :-P
05:28:51 <Igloo> Or Am I Confused
05:28:59 <swisscheese> :-P
05:29:21 <Darius> I know. I said I made sense of it.
05:29:24 <swisscheese> Oops I thought that was an option.
05:38:36 <swisscheese> Anyone thinking about my puzzle question?
05:39:43 * Darius doesn't understand what you are attempting to do.
05:40:01 <Darius> You've presented two problems, and in both cases my first response (internally) is "Then just do that"
05:40:15 * Igloo didn't quite get what your problem was either
05:41:38 <swisscheese> Well it might be that the answer is trivial and show my newbieness but I just don't see how to pass the root. Maybe a snip of code will help...
05:42:24 <swisscheese> solution :: Puzzle -> Tree
05:42:24 <swisscheese> solution puz = Node puz (newPuzzles rootTree puz)
05:42:42 <swisscheese> What do I replace rootTree with?
05:43:16 <shapr> Lemmih: are you really irc'ing as root?
05:43:32 * shapr suspects humor
05:43:33 <swisscheese> I suppose I could use "solution orig puz" but that seems rather inefficient.
05:44:32 <Darius> What is solution supposed to do given a puzzle?
05:44:47 <swisscheese> Build the tree of reachable positions.
05:45:02 <Darius> What is "rootTree" supposed to be?
05:45:16 <swisscheese> The tree so far.
05:45:38 <swisscheese> ... starting from the root position.
05:45:45 <swisscheese> (position == puzzle)
05:46:47 <Darius> What's wrong with simply passing in the tree?
05:47:15 <Darius> solution treeSoFar puzzle = Node puzzle (newPuzzles treeSoFar puzzle)
05:49:29 <swisscheese> Because you have no recursion.
05:49:51 <swisscheese> You are not building a tree.
05:50:48 <Darius> That wasn't your original question.
05:51:34 <swisscheese> Yes I need to build the tree.
05:51:50 <swisscheese> But avoid repeating positions.
05:52:00 <Darius> Okay, so where are you having problems doing that?
05:53:05 <swisscheese> I can build a tree. I can determine if a position is new. But I can't do both.
05:53:26 <Darius> Why not?
05:54:09 <swisscheese> Because building the tree is recursive and determining if a position is new needs reference to the non-recursive root of the tree.
05:55:10 <Darius> What's a "non-recursive root of a tree"?
05:55:42 <swisscheese> It's just the root of the tree.
05:57:29 <swisscheese> I need something like this:
05:57:30 <swisscheese> solution :: Puzzle -> Tree
05:57:30 <swisscheese> solution puz = Node puz (puz (map (solution)(newMoves rootTree puz)))
05:58:28 <Darius> Would solution puzzle = Node puzzle (map solution (newMoves resultTree puzzle)) be a clearer statement of what you want?
06:00:01 <swisscheese> I think yes but we don't have resultTree yet.
06:01:22 <Darius> So you'd want something like, solution puzzle = resultTree where resultTree = Node puzzle (map solution' (newMoves resultTree puzzle))?
06:01:43 <Darius> Where solution' might be solution or helper function depending on what you want.
06:04:17 <swisscheese> I'm not clear on solution'. Maybe the problem is not clear. It's like the chess knight tour - generate the tree of moves for the kight without revisiting a position.
06:05:37 <Darius> How do you go about generating the next level of the tree?
06:06:25 <swisscheese> The availble moves from any positon is trivial to compute.
06:08:53 <Darius> So the available moves at the current position is the next level of the tree?
06:09:33 <swisscheese> Yes but the trick is to avoid positons already in the tree.
06:09:46 <Darius> So then that is not the next level.
06:10:47 <swisscheese> ?
06:13:09 <swisscheese> Allowing repeat positions is easy:
06:13:09 <swisscheese> solution :: Puzzle -> Tree
06:13:10 <swisscheese> solution puz = Node puz (map (solution)(moves puz)))
06:14:30 <Darius> swisscheese: Yes, that's the point.  -All- available moves from a position don't make up the next set, only the ones that haven't already occurred.
06:14:46 <swisscheese> Yes of course.
06:16:55 <Darius> There are several ways you could do this.  One way that looks pretty simple would be to generate all positions and then filter the final tree all at once.
06:17:55 <swisscheese> Yes I thought about it but the the all-positions tree is infinite. I have not played with infinite structures yet.
06:19:37 <swisscheese> I could use something like this but seems inefficient:
06:19:38 <swisscheese> solution :: Puzzle -> Tree
06:19:38 <swisscheese> solution puz = Node puz (map solution (newMoves (solution rootPuz))))
06:21:50 <Darius> What is rootPuz?
06:22:18 <swisscheese> The starting position.
06:23:45 <swisscheese> For example the knight in the center of the board.
06:24:12 <Darius> Presumably you'll call solution with rootPuz to start?
06:24:26 <swisscheese> Yes.
06:25:16 <swisscheese> Maybe the idea of pruning the infinite tree is the right approach?
06:25:47 <Darius> (I'll ignore where I was going for a second) How does the above function get any closer to solving the problem?
06:26:54 <swisscheese> IMO the above IS the solution but it seem inefficient. newMoves gives only moves not in the supplied tree.
06:28:13 --- mode: truong.freenode.net set +b *!*@206.169.168.190
06:30:35 <Darius> Well, I'll mention what I was going to say earlier.  If you call it with solution rootPuz, the consider the following.  solution rootPuz = x = Node puz (map solution (newMoves x)
06:31:33 <Darius> I.e. x = solution rootPuz which equals the definition, so we can replace the use of solution rootPuz with x.
06:31:56 <swisscheese> First, I think I meant: solution puz = Node puz (map solution (newMoves (puz (solution rootPuz)))))
06:32:12 <swisscheese> (I missed the puz param to newMoves).
06:32:29 <Darius> Actually I think you meant, newMoves puz (solution rootPuz)
06:32:58 <Darius> Unless you mean to apply puz to solution rootPuz, which would imply Puzzle is a type synonym for a function type.
06:33:25 <swisscheese> You are right.
06:33:51 <swisscheese> I am confused by " = x ="
06:35:38 <Darius> Just making up a name.
06:36:36 <Darius> Call solution rootPuz x, then replace occurences of solution rootPuz with x and note that x is equal to the body of solution with rootPuz substituted for puz.
06:37:03 <Darius> I.e. x = Node rootPuz (map solution (newMoves rootPuz x))
06:40:14 <swisscheese> I not sure if I lost because of the approach or trouble visualizing the full code.
06:41:00 <swisscheese> is that like:
06:41:25 <swisscheese> solution rootPuz = x whee x = Node puz (map solution (newMoves x)
06:41:30 <swisscheese> where
06:42:22 <Darius> No, everything after i.e. is legal Haskell that would be equivalent to calling solution rootPuz with your earlier definition.
06:43:11 <Darius> So if, theSolution = solution rootPuz, renaming x to theSolution, you'd have, theSolution = Node rootPuz (map solution (newMoves rootPuz theSolution))
06:45:57 <swisscheese> IMO no, "newMoves rootPuz" is not recursive - will always be generating the few positons reachable in one move from the rootPuz.
06:47:45 <Darius> I didn't say the above code worked.  I said it was an equivalent way of rewriting what you wrote earlier.
06:48:52 <Darius> Presumably newMove takes the current "puzzle" and a tree containing "puzzles" and produces the list of positions from the current "puzzle" minus the ones already in the tree.
06:49:03 <swisscheese> Exactly.
06:52:11 <Darius> Well, the code you have above (modulo the type error) and my rewrite, theSolution, will almost do the right thing except since you likely search the -whole- tree it -will- search the -whole- infinite tree.
06:53:04 <Darius> Actually, that isn't quite the problem.  It will search to much of the tree
06:53:27 <Darius> it will get into a situation along the lines of searching the child nodes to know whether to add the parent.
06:53:49 <swisscheese> I'm starting to like the idea of pruning the infinite tree.
06:55:51 <Darius> That's one of three general approaches that I can think up.  The recent discussion is almost to another.
06:57:16 <Darius> The problem with the above code, is simply that the "search" function doesn't know when to stop.
06:58:58 <swisscheese> OK
06:59:03 <Darius> Assuming you searched the tree as you built it, when would you know you didn't need to search anymore (for the current "puzzle")?
07:05:15 <swisscheese> If we search as we built we would be searching a finite tree and then no problem.
07:05:40 <swisscheese> It seems same problem with pruning. Probably I have various errors but so far I have:
07:05:41 <swisscheese> buildTree :: Puzzle -> Tree
07:05:41 <swisscheese> buildTree puz = Node puz (map buildTree (moves puz))
07:05:41 <swisscheese> rootTree = buildTree rootPuz
07:05:41 <swisscheese> pruneTree :: Tree -> Tree
07:05:41 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p t) = if treeHasPuzzle rootTree p then Nil
07:05:42 <swisscheese>                        else Node (p pruneTree t)
07:08:10 <Lemmih> Are there any hs bindings for SDL?
07:08:18 <Lemmih> s/hs/Haskell/
07:11:02 <Darius> Lemmih: A couple actually, but I don't think too many are announced or well maintained.
07:12:43 <Darius> swisscheese: Using that technique, unless you want to wait a long but depending on your problem, finite amount of time, you'd want to search breadth-first.
07:12:47 <Lemmih> I searched google but I didn't find anything...
07:14:07 <Lemmih> Darius: Can you give me their names or perhaps urls?
07:16:50 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/hasdl-0.1pre7.tar.gz
07:17:32 <Darius> shapr: That Sean's?
07:17:45 <shapr> that binding is by Richard Braakman (dark) based on overcode's book "Programming Linux Games"
07:17:54 <shapr> the book is GPL'd or equivalent
07:17:57 <shapr> the binding is not maintained
07:18:09 <shapr> and it's incomplete
07:18:15 <shapr> but it has some neat features
07:18:35 <shapr> Darius: I know someone in france was working on an SDL binding, is that Sean?
07:18:57 <shapr> ah, it was Nicolas Oury
07:19:23 <shapr> Sean seefried?
07:19:26 <shapr> aka seafood?
07:19:36 <Darius> I think Igloo did part of one and Sean, I thought, had (part of) one, but doesn't seem to have it linked anymore and I think at the time he said he wasn't going to support it anymore.
07:19:37 <Darius> Yes.
07:19:54 <shapr> I wonder if we can find a lead SDL binding person
07:20:06 <shapr> it would be nice to have
07:20:35 <shapr> dark's code is really cool, but I'm not interested enough in SDL to work on it.
07:21:51 <Igloo> I didn't do one - I looked at darcs briefly before realising it wouldn't do more for me than HOpenGL
07:22:00 <Igloo> Eeek - dark's
07:22:04 * shapr understood
07:22:15 <shapr> hey, have you had time to try the darcs-wiki?
07:22:55 <shapr> Lemmih: so, that's the best answer we've got, there's an incomplete and unmaintained (but nifty) binding, do you just want to use one? or do you want to maintain one?
07:22:57 * Igloo has been hectic  :-(  I'll probably wait until Isaac has packages in Debian, anyway
07:23:24 <shapr> oh, does anyone have both exim and postfix .forward experience?
07:23:31 <swisscheese> Darius - how stop task bar flashing (I'm trying to concentrate)?
07:23:49 <shapr> sounds like mIRC, it's one of the preferences
07:23:50 <Lemmih> shapr: Heh I dont think im good enough to maintain it. I haven't used Haskell very long.
07:24:12 <shapr> Lemmih: fair enough, btw, are you really irc'ing as root? if so, it's not safe.
07:25:53 * Darius doesn't know how to get X-Chat from flashing the bar when his name is mentioned.
07:25:53 <Lemmih> Oh. Must have started gaim for the wrong console :)
07:25:54 <shapr> Lemmih: Nicolas Oury seemed interested enough to want to write his own SDL binding, but I haven't heard anything from him lately.
07:26:16 <Lemmih> brb
07:27:07 <Darius> shapr you should have h4x0red his machine and popped up a message telling him to log on as another user.
07:27:15 * shapr grins
07:27:19 <shapr> but that would be impolite
07:28:01 <shapr> hej Lemmih 
07:28:06 <shapr> är du dansk?
07:28:07 <Lemmih> yo :)
07:28:18 <shapr> I have a *fan* ?
07:28:21 <shapr> whoa
07:28:31 <shapr> what does that mean anyway?
07:28:59 <shapr> wow
07:59:47 <swisscheese> Darius - I have not gotten very far. I'm not sure this is breath first and still don't know when to stop searching the tree.
07:59:48 <swisscheese> pruneTree :: Tree -> Tree -- remove dupes
07:59:48 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p t) = Let x = Node (p pruneTree t) In
07:59:48 <swisscheese>                        if treeHasPuzzle rootTree p then Nil
07:59:48 <swisscheese>                        else x
08:04:43 <Darius> swisscheese: You need to filter out the duplicates, so you need to keep track of the ones you've seen as you prune and only remove ones if you've already seen it.
08:06:25 <shapr> whenever I think I have too much work, I remember that I work from home, and I get paid to write Python (and maybe soon Haskell). Then I feel better.
08:06:35 * shapr bounces
08:07:12 * Riastradh duct tapes shapr to the floor.
08:07:26 * shapr wiggles furiously
08:07:57 * Riastradh tries to decide what to do with shapr now taped to the floor.
08:08:13 <Riastradh> I wish I'd think of those sorts of things when I make these plans initially.
08:08:41 * shapr pulls out his leatherman (always on his belt) and cuts the duct tape!
08:08:48 <shapr> aha! I can make my great escape now!
08:09:04 * Riastradh grabs shapr's leatherman with a lasso of duct tape and then snares shapr with another lasso.
08:09:09 * shapr moos
08:09:18 <swisscheese> Did I solve the breadth first issue?
08:10:28 * Riastradh milks shapr.
08:10:55 <shapr> I'm sure that would get you chaotic code
08:11:05 <shapr> ideas that don't work, that sort of stuff.
08:11:07 <Riastradh> That's what THIS is for!
08:11:13 * Riastradh gestures at a pasteurizer.
08:11:21 * Riastradh cackles evilly.
08:11:23 <shapr> oh no! I'm being put out to pasteur!
08:11:48 <Darius> swisscheese: No.
08:12:19 <bring> lol
08:12:20 * Riastradh homogenizes shapr!
08:13:00 <shapr> what does [ -z "$FOO" ] do in a shell script? tests for variable existence?
08:14:13 <Darius> I think [ foo ] is test foo.
08:14:20 <shapr> oh
08:14:21 <Riastradh> shapr, yes.
08:14:57 <Darius> help test
08:15:01 <shapr> okay, thanks
08:15:10 <Riastradh> Or rather, its nonexistence.
08:15:15 <Riastradh> [riastradh@Slate ~]% if [ -z "$SHELL" ]; then echo mumble; else echo frotz; fi
08:15:15 <Riastradh> frotz
08:15:15 <Riastradh> [riastradh@Slate ~]% if [ -z "$FOO" ]; then echo mumble; else echo frotz; fi
08:15:15 <Riastradh> mumble
08:15:45 <shapr> ah, I see
08:20:38 <swisscheese> Well I'm lost :-(
08:23:50 * Riastradh hands swisscheese a map.
08:24:11 <Riastradh> You're in #haskell.
08:25:15 <swisscheese> I was addressing Darius - but I am working on a new thought now :-)
08:27:00 * Riastradh is feeling exhilaratingly silly this morning.
08:38:13 <swisscheese> OK - I wrote nub in a simply form and then tried to mimick it:
08:38:14 <swisscheese> pruneTree :: Tree -> Tree -- remove dupes
08:38:14 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p [t:ts]) = if treeHasPuzzle p ts then Node (p ts) else
08:38:14 <swisscheese>                             prunetree Node (p ts)
08:40:14 <swisscheese> And perhaps:
08:40:15 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p []) = Node p []
08:43:36 <swisscheese> Correction:
08:43:36 <swisscheese> pruneTree :: Tree -> Tree -- remove dupes
08:43:37 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p []) = Node p []
08:43:37 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p [t:ts]) = if and (treeHasPuzzle p) ts then Node (p ts) else
08:43:37 <swisscheese>                             pruneTree Node (p ts)
08:44:03 <swisscheese> Rather:
08:44:03 <swisscheese> pruneTree :: Tree -> Tree -- remove dupes
08:44:03 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p []) = Node p []
08:44:03 <swisscheese> pruneTree (Node p [t:ts]) = if any (treeHasPuzzle p) ts then Node (p ts) else
08:44:03 <swisscheese>                             pruneTree Node (p ts)
08:53:44 <cm> http://www.pastebin.com/38326 if someone cares ;)
08:54:32 <swisscheese> I guess nub is not a good model as it's for finite lists.
08:54:51 <cm> monad'ish .dot generation..
08:59:21 <swisscheese> You still there Darius?
09:02:10 --- mode: truong.freenode.net set +b *!*@206.169.168.190
09:10:24 <Darius> swisscheese: The most straightforward way I see to do it with a generate-and-test approach is to pass around a Set of seen "puzzles" while traversing the tree.
09:12:50 <swisscheese> OK, let me think about that.
09:37:12 <shapr> @yow
09:37:13 <lambdabot> Okay, BARBRA STREISAND, I recognize you now!!  Also EFREM ZIMBALIST,
09:37:13 <lambdabot>  JUNIOR!!  And BEAUMONT NEWHALL!!  Everybody into th' BATHROOM!
09:37:18 <shapr> @fortune
09:37:20 <lambdabot> Sailing is fun, but scrubbing the decks is aardvark.
09:37:20 <lambdabot> 		-- Heard on Noahs' ark
09:37:24 <shapr> haha
09:51:37 * Riastradh groans.
09:55:28 <shapr> so, if I wanted to combine Haskell and http://fit.c2.com/ would it into the darcs repository browser, or maybe haddock?
10:02:09 <Riastradh> 'Would it into?'
10:09:36 * stepcut plays with hopengl
10:26:05 <shapr> sorry, "would it belong in"
10:26:35 <shapr> in a nutshell, fit lets you put unit tests in via wiki, and then run them, and the cells in the table representing the unit tests turn red or green
10:27:06 <shapr> so you'd need some way to automatically find the unit tests in the source, like prop_* in QuickCheck
10:27:25 <shapr> actually, QC may be the best place to start since it already has that convention
10:29:11 <shapr> is there a convention for HUnit test names?
10:31:56 <Darius> tests in HUnit (and QuickCheck for that matter) are first-class objects.
10:32:23 <Darius> For example, my C code generator tests are all stuffed in a big "tree".
10:32:41 <Darius> With 'tests' bound to it.
10:33:34 <shapr> for a multi-developer project like lambdabot, would a wiki be a good way to submit hunit or quickcheck tests?
10:33:38 <stepcut> hey shapr! Did you see that yet another person is doing a HaskellDB/ghc port?
10:33:51 <shapr> stepcut: yes, he's even here on #haskell
10:34:05 <shapr> oh wait, do you mean a third person?
10:34:14 <shapr> I know about bring and now #haskelldb
10:34:43 <stepcut> well, there is me, those college kids, and some guy posted something on the mailing list about using template haskell 
10:34:55 <shapr> oh, I didn't hear about the third person then
10:34:57 <Darius> shapr: It would be an interesting way.
10:35:27 <bring> stepcut: I'm one of the college kids
10:35:33 * shapr grins
10:35:47 <andersca> haha
10:36:39 <bring> how are you dealing with record types?
10:38:15 <bring> what's the status of your port?
10:38:24 <stepcut> bring: I was still at the playing around stage
10:38:36 <bring> ok
10:39:03 <bring> interesting that others are working on the same thing
10:39:30 <bring> we are planning to release an alpha on wednesday
10:39:38 <bring> did you get yours working?
10:40:35 <stepcut> partially
10:41:07 <stepcut> There are two stages: generating the sql statement, and doing something with query results
10:41:24 <stepcut> I am about 85% done with the generating the sql statement part
10:43:26 <bring> so you reimplemented HaskellDB?
10:43:40 <stepcut> no
10:43:46 <stepcut> hacked stuff on top of it
10:44:05 <bring> but HaskellDB already generates SQL?
10:44:22 <bring> just that the HaskellDB type system uses Trex
10:44:37 <stepcut> yes, I removed the Trex dependencies
10:44:58 <bring> what did you use instead?
10:46:00 <stepcut> good question...
10:46:24 <stepcut> I used a combination of normal records and tuples
10:47:00 <stepcut> and defined a new class MkAssoc
10:47:28 <stepcut> all clear now :p
10:48:50 <bring> so, how does project work then?
10:51:50 <stepcut> hrm, let me check
10:52:02 <bring> type-wise, I mean
10:52:17 <andersca> bring: perhaps stepcut is going to type check
10:52:24 <bring> :)
10:55:50 <stepcut> ah, I defined a new type class 'Project' 
10:56:00 <stepcut> class Project a where     project :: a -> Query (Rel r)
10:56:10 <stepcut> instance Project (Expr a) where
10:56:24 <stepcut> instance Project ((Expr a), (Expr a)) where
10:56:52 <stepcut> (there is stuff after the where clause that I have not copied)
10:57:04 <stepcut> testQn = do { t <- table table1
10:57:08 <stepcut> 	    ; restrict (t!xida .==. constant 1)
10:57:13 <stepcut> 	    ; project  (t!xida,t!notesa)
10:57:17 <stepcut> 	    }
10:57:59 <stepcut> so basically, you put the columns you want to project in a tuple, and call project from the type class Project
10:58:21 <stepcut> all the  instances of project will be autogenerated via template haskell
10:58:36 <bring> how is the r type in the return value of project constructed?
10:58:52 <bring> I mean, I should depend on a, right?
10:59:01 <bring> s/I/it/
11:00:39 <stepcut> hrm, well in that example the type of testQn is ->  testQn :: forall r. Query (Rel r)
11:01:08 <bring> ah, ok
11:01:30 <stepcut> this is what I am looking into now -- making sure I am not losing too much type information
11:02:16 <stepcut> :t table1
11:02:19 <stepcut> doh
11:02:32 <bring> with your solution, there is no check that the attribute that you are trying to get from a Relation is actually in that relation?
11:03:14 <stepcut> that could currently be the case
11:06:48 <stepcut> actually, I am not sure what you mean by that...
11:07:49 <bring> say that you do rel <- query db testQn
11:08:06 <bring> putStrLn (rel!user_name)
11:08:43 <stepcut> bring: ah, that is the part I have not gotten to yet -- what happens after you perform a query
11:09:02 <bring> ah, ok, now I'm with you
11:10:36 <stepcut> currently, I think I just return a tuple, so you have to use pattern matching
11:13:44 <stepcut> hrm, actually, I have no idea what happens, I never tried to perform a query for real
11:23:41 <swisscheese> Darius - I'm not sure this is right or that it terminates
11:23:41 <swisscheese> allPositions :: Puzzle -> [Puzzle]
11:23:41 <swisscheese> allPositions puz = nubBy match ([puz] ++ m ++ (map allPositions m)) where m = moves puz
11:29:17 <bring> stepcut: we use multi-parameter type classes to simulate extensible record types, it seems to work for everything that HaskllDB needs
11:30:24 <bring> basically there is: class HasField f r
11:31:00 <bring> there is an instance of HasField f r if the record r has the field f
11:32:15 <stepcut> bring: sounds cool! Once I heard you guys where working on it, I decided to put a hold on what I was doing -- since I am mostly just hacking around anyway. 
11:32:33 <bring> and the records are a simple recursive algebraic type
11:33:17 <bring> you are welcome to hack around with our code 
11:33:40 <stepcut> is it online somewhere?
11:34:14 <bring> not yet, but it will be by wednesday
11:34:35 <stepcut> excellent
11:35:24 <stepcut> I have no particular attachment to my code -- I spent of the time learning the FFI and template haskell anyway
11:36:33 <bring> but you have experience with another way of solving the problem, I'm sure you can contribute a lot of good ideas
11:37:29 <stepcut> One 'cool' thing about my code is that the act of compiling it with ghc, causes a database query that gets all the current database type information -- but that can easily be simulated with a Makefile.
11:38:01 <stepcut> Any if you can't connect to the database server at compile time, then you are screwed :)
11:38:49 <bring> :)
11:39:35 <bring> so you do the database query from template haskell?
11:39:51 <stepcut> yeah
11:39:52 <bring> what database library do you use?
11:40:07 <stepcut> HSQL
11:40:33 <bring> we do too
11:40:50 <stepcut> I also have a homebrew Mysql interface that works with hugs+haskellDB+linux
11:40:57 <bring> are you using the CVS version of HSQL?
11:41:08 <stepcut> bring: yes, with some minor tweaks
11:41:51 <bring> I'm a HSQL developer too, care to share your tweaks?
11:43:09 <stepcut> sure, what is the best what to send them?
11:43:44 <stepcut> basically, I had to modify package.conf.in slightly, and I added some 'deriving Show' clauses
11:44:12 <bring> is your code based on the latest CVS version?
11:45:45 <stepcut> it appears so
11:46:38 <bring> easiest would probably be if you made a cvs diff end emailed to me
11:48:53 <swisscheese> Better: allPositions puz = nubBy match (puz : (map allPositions (moves puz))
11:50:24 * kowey struggles with continuation style passing
11:50:44 <kowey> i'm working on the Yet Another Intro to Haskell exercises...
11:50:49 <Riastradh> kowey, you mixed up the order of words there.
11:51:01 <kowey> continuation passing style, thanks
11:51:02 <Riastradh> You've got to be careful.  CPS makes the order of the flow of control specific.
11:51:30 <kowey> anyway, i've got a cmap that works, would anyone mind checking it, since it's not in the key?
11:51:44 <Riastradh> kowey, how long is it?
11:51:45 <kowey> cmap' f (x:xs) = f x (cmap' f xs)
11:51:46 <kowey> cmap f l = cmap' (\x g -> ((f x) : g)) l
11:51:59 <kowey> minus the base case, of course,
11:52:05 <kowey> cmap' f [] = []
11:52:17 <Riastradh> No, that's wrong.  You can tell it's wrong because you've got calls that aren't tail-calls.
11:52:20 <kowey> cmap (1+) [1,2,3] does the right thing, but does my impl miss the point?
11:52:22 <kowey> ok
11:52:52 <Riastradh> First, write a plain map.
11:53:04 <kowey> uh... ok
11:53:05 <kowey> brb
11:53:34 <Riastradh> A CPS map is just a plain map, but all calls are done in CPS rather than nesting expressions in function operands.
11:53:54 <kowey> plain map: map f (x:xs) = (f x) : (map f xs)
11:54:13 <Riastradh> You don't need any of the parentheses that you've put on the right side of the =, by the way.
11:54:24 <kowey> problem is that i only vaguely understand CPS as "passing a func that says what to do next"
11:54:28 <Riastradh> Function application _always_ binds most tightly.
11:54:46 * kowey nods and absorbs
11:55:13 <kowey> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs?
11:55:19 <Riastradh> Yup.
11:56:13 <Riastradh> CPS is very simple.  Instead of writing [[f (g x)]] -- where the call to g is nested in the call to f, and where you're using _implicit_ continuations (when g 'returns,' it's really applying its continuation, but you don't see that continuation) --, you make the continuation _explicit_: [[g x (\r -> f r)]].
11:56:59 <Riastradh> In [[g x (\r -> f r)]], r will be bound to simply what g 'returns'; in this case, though, rather than g 'returning' as you might ordinarily write g to, g invokes its second argument with the 'return value.'
11:57:21 <kowey> sounds like the formal semantics of a proper name
11:57:31 <kowey> (in comp. ling)
11:58:06 <Riastradh> Notice now how all of the calls in that expression are tail calls.  Previously, g was nested in an argument to f; now, it is called in a tail position, and in the continuation, f is called in a tail position.
11:58:07 <kowey> sorry about that, mental babble, trying to draw connections to familiar territory
11:59:23 * kowey rereads and absorbs
12:00:40 <kowey> so i'm function g: rather than simply returning a value for f to consume
12:00:56 <kowey> i gobble f, do something on r, and force-feed the result to f
12:01:04 <Riastradh> No, not quite.
12:01:32 <Riastradh> If you are g, you're doing the same thing as you were before.  It's just that the notion of 'returning' changes from invoking the _implicit_ continuation to invoking the _explicit_ continuation.
12:01:43 <Riastradh> With only implicit continuations, you don't really think about them.
12:02:06 <Riastradh> In [[f (g x)]], there are two implicit continuations: the continuation of the call to g and that of the call to f.
12:05:53 * kowey furrows brows
12:06:20 <kowey> would a formal def of a continuation be scary for a newbie to look at?
12:06:40 <kowey> informally: "what to do next"?
12:08:59 <kowey> or rather, using the labels you give in your explanation,
12:09:13 <kowey> map g (x:xs) = g x : map g xs
12:09:23 <kowey> instead of writing [[: (g x)]]...
12:10:50 <Riastradh> Perhaps you should try reading this: http://www.bloodandcoffee.net/campbell/txt/cps-tutorial.log  It uses Scheme, not Haskell, but nothing particularly specific to Scheme; (lambda (x y z) body) translates to [[\x y z -> body]]; (f x y z) translates to [[f x y z]].
12:11:36 <kowey> will do
12:12:11 <kowey> thanks for the help... it's fun getting mentally limbered up for a return to functional programming
12:34:07 <kowey> try #2
12:34:29 <kowey> cmap' g' [] = []
12:34:29 <kowey> cmap' g' (x:xs) = g' x (\y -> y : cmap' g' xs)
12:34:29 <kowey> cmap g l = cmap' (\x f -> f (g x)) l
12:35:18 <kowey> the continuation is a function that concats the result of g to the rest of the map
12:37:02 <Darius> Have fun Riastradh.
12:37:14 <kowey> uh-oh
12:40:27 * Riastradh returns.
12:41:25 <Darius> You mean apply yourself to the current continuation.
12:41:41 <Riastradh> They're synonymous, Darius, and 'return' is shorter to say.
12:42:09 <Riastradh> kowey, now, the idea is to give cmap' an explicit continuation.
12:43:03 <kowey> do you mean cmap' is reasonable?
12:43:29 <kowey> and that i should try doing something else besides what cmap does in order to see why CPS is useful?
12:43:38 <Riastradh> OK, first, show the original, ordinary map..
12:43:46 * Riastradh attacks his period key viciously.
12:44:12 <kowey> omap g (x:xs) = g x : omap g xs
12:44:35 <Riastradh> OK.  Now don't use operators; call (:) as you would another function.
12:45:16 <kowey> cmap' g' [] = []
12:45:16 <kowey> cmap' g' (x:xs) = g' x (: cmap' g' xs)
12:45:22 <Riastradh> No, with the original map.
12:45:41 <Riastradh> And that's not how you'd call (:) as an ordinary function, either.
12:45:52 <Riastradh> That use would be like [[\x -> x : cmap' g' xs]].
12:45:56 <kowey> hang on, operators?
12:46:17 <Riastradh> You know that [[x : y]] is equivalent to [[(:) x y]], right?
12:46:28 * kowey nods
12:46:38 <kowey> don't use : infix
12:46:39 <kowey> ok
12:46:46 <Riastradh> So what's omap now?
12:47:01 <Riastradh> (The elimination of the infix just makes it easier to see the nesting of function calls.)
12:47:22 <kowey> opap g (x:xs) = (:) (g x) (omap g xs)
12:47:49 <phubuh> not that it's really relevant, but you need to type (:) to get the function corresponding to the : operator
12:48:28 <Riastradh> Now, there are two nested function calls there, but function calls may not be operands to other function calls, so you need to CPS transform [[g x]] and [[omap g xs]].
12:50:22 <Riastradh> kowey, does that make sense?
12:50:43 <kowey> not sure
12:50:55 <Riastradh> You know what tail calls are, right?
12:51:20 <kowey> no
12:51:29 <Riastradh> ...oh.
12:51:47 <kowey> i thought i did... sorry, didn't realise
12:51:55 <Riastradh> What did you think they were?
12:52:47 <kowey> didn't exactly think :-)... just that the the term didn't faze me like it should have
12:53:10 <Riastradh> OK, perhaps you ought to skip the section on CPS, learn a bit more, and come back to it.
12:53:44 * kowey nods
12:53:50 <kowey> right, tail calls
12:54:44 <kowey> oh wait, i see what you mean... plug ahead and look at CPS later
12:54:51 <Riastradh> Yes.
12:55:17 <kowey> shrug... well thanks for your patience
12:55:36 <kowey> hope my struggling wasn't what drove all those people away :-)
13:09:02 <eixei> hi
13:15:22 <eixei> lol
13:33:32 <eixei> night everyone
13:35:30 <cm> grr, left contact lense is being annoying
13:35:54 <cm> damn vanity :p
13:42:54 <apmuf> :)
15:30:24 <Maddas> ecraven: around?
15:47:50 <ecraven> yep
15:47:54 <ecraven> almost gone :)
15:48:30 <ecraven> i got a reply yesterday.. shipment to europe is about 30$ if i order a new one, about 69$ for a refurbished, so it'd be about 270$ for a new one..
15:48:58 <ecraven> after the invoice date i can send it back for 60 days, though i have to pay shipment + handling both ways
15:49:25 <ecraven> and i have to fax my credit card + some id, there's apparently been some cases of fraud..
15:49:45 <ecraven> i think i'll order one around the end of february.. won't be near a computer much the next weeks
17:30:55 <stepcut> hrm, I wonder how to convert a float to a list of Word8
17:52:09 <stepcut> sweet!
18:34:00 <SyntaxLaptop> does anyone know why there's no copyFile in System.Directory?
18:37:08 <Igloo> It's not a simple matter of changing a directory's contents
18:37:44 <SyntaxLaptop> copyFile, I mean, not copyDirectory
18:38:01 <Igloo> So do I
18:38:18 <SyntaxLaptop> can you explain, then? :)
18:38:52 <Igloo> Well, to rename a file or to remove one you just change the entry in the directory
18:39:10 <SyntaxLaptop> yeah
18:39:11 <Igloo> But to copy a file you have to copy the file contents before altering the directory itself
18:39:47 <Igloo> Possibly there's no portable C function to wrap either
18:40:00 <SyntaxLaptop> what do you mean "before altering the directory itself"?
18:40:03 <cleverdra> No trivial syscall, indeed.
18:40:47 <Igloo> If a directory is really a file containing (name, inode) pairs then to copy a file you first need to copy it to a new inode, then add a pair to the directory
18:42:29 <Igloo> (in response to your original question, I don't actually know why, but I can see why it wouldn't be there given the above. You might be able to get one added if you talk to libraries@, though (or possibly elsewhere in the libs))
18:44:12 <SyntaxLaptop> I think that having this would be useful:
18:44:12 <SyntaxLaptop> copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
18:44:12 <SyntaxLaptop> copyFile p1 p2 = readFile p1 >>= writeFile p2
18:44:23 <SyntaxLaptop> but are you saying that it wouldn't work if that's a directory (true)
18:47:46 <Igloo> No - just ignore what I said
18:47:50 * Igloo goes to get some sleep
18:48:50 <SyntaxLaptop> Igloo: sorry if I'm being dense
18:48:50 <SyntaxLaptop> :P
18:48:50 <SyntaxLaptop> good night
