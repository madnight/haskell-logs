00:00:00 <shapr> looks like fun
00:00:16 <shapr> Robert Love, Hans Reiser
00:00:33 <shapr> corbet does lwn.net?
00:00:38 <shapr> yes
00:00:57 <andersca> I've never met robert love
00:00:59 <andersca> it's going to be interesting
00:01:05 * andersca is going to bring his kernel book to get it signede
00:01:12 <shapr> RMS will be there
00:01:23 <shapr> one day I'm going to kick his ass, I swear
00:01:24 <andersca> I've met rms in denmark 2001
00:01:33 <andersca> he signed my emacs manual
00:01:36 <shapr> heh, cool!
00:01:46 <mgoetze> shapr: you don't like rms?
00:03:12 <shapr> mgoetze: nah, I think he's a fascist dictator of the FSF. I also think he's often perfectly correct, but I don't like the way he does it.
00:03:38 <shapr> mgoetze: on the other hand, I'm really happy he's accomplished what he has
00:03:46 <mgoetze> i think fascist dictatorship can be pretty efficient ;)
00:03:49 <shapr> the GPL and the FSF have done many great things.
00:03:58 <shapr> mgoetze: you have a point, no time lost in mocracizing
00:04:24 <andersca> shapr: next friday john is going to teach us about type systems
00:04:30 <andersca> shapr: as in, hold a lecture about them
00:04:31 <shapr> cool!
00:04:41 <andersca> and we're free to suggest topics that we'd like him to talk about
00:05:17 <shapr> well, you could be vicious and ask about the two-way type refining stuff that SPJ was explaining at HIM 2003
00:06:06 <shapr> or you could ask about type-slicing, and how it relates to Sulzmann's constraint handling view of type systems.
00:06:12 <andersca> :)
00:06:45 <shapr> you could ask what's different between System F and System F-omega 
00:07:12 <shapr> oh, you could ask about the big O complexity of type check in different systems
00:08:06 <andersca> I actually meant generic topics about haskell
00:08:09 <andersca> not just type systems
00:08:13 <andersca> although your suggestions are good :)
00:08:20 <shapr> for example, is type-checking always guaranteed to terminate in each of the commonly used type-systems?
00:09:30 <shapr> I vaguely recally that Hal came up with a bit of Haskell code that had some scary large big O complexity to type check.
00:10:27 <dennisb> type check or type infer?
00:10:32 <andersca> hej dennisb!
00:10:38 <dennisb> hej andersca!
00:11:16 <shapr> were I to think up the most useful question for a class like that, I'd ask John for tricks and tips that could be used to structure a Haskell program such that it takes advantage of the type system
00:12:06 <shapr> a type system is just a low-power automated proof checker. You, as the programmer, get to choose how your program uses the type system
00:12:27 <shapr> you can use it to support lots of correctness checking, or you can use Dynamics and totally ignore the type system.
00:13:02 <shapr> andersca: actually, if you ask him that question, I want to know the answer you get!
00:13:11 <andersca> hehe, yeah
00:13:32 <dennisb> and the question
00:14:11 <shapr> that would make a good HaWiki page, TypeTips or something
00:14:28 <andersca> I'd like advanced type tips 
00:14:47 <shapr> for example, data Name = String is nice for client :: Name, but is there some way you can enforce that sort of stuff?
00:15:21 <andersca> newtype newtype!
00:15:24 <andersca> ;)
00:16:15 <shapr> right, so what else can you do?
00:16:51 <dennisb> type Name = String
00:16:53 <andersca> I'd like to learn about more advanced things, like T-REX and what that is
00:16:57 <dennisb> what else do you want?
00:17:46 <shapr> dennisb: ways to use the type system to 'support' automated checking in programs 
00:18:01 <shapr> hi adept 
00:19:04 <shapr> whoa, the StudyGroup page on HaWiki was linked from lambda.weblogs.com
00:19:17 <adept> shapr: 
00:19:19 * shapr is amazed
00:21:31 <shapr> hoi earthy 
00:23:38 <earthy> morning shapr
00:23:39 <shapr> what else fits into the study of monads in Haskell? Wadler's paper Marriage of Effects and Monads?
00:27:07 <Darius> There are quite a few papers applying the concept.
00:27:18 <shapr> I'd like to trace the path of monads from Category Theory into Haskell, so, Moggi's original papers -> Wadler's Marriage paper -> ?
00:27:48 <shapr> Darius: did you see that StudyGroup is linked on the front page of lambda.weblogs.com?
00:27:50 * shapr feels famous
00:27:59 <shapr> we're famous!
00:28:02 <Darius> Isn't he Marriage of Effects and Monads relatively recent?  The Essense of Functional Programming would seem to be the better choice.
00:28:17 <Darius> shapr: I checked it out after you mentioned it.
00:28:33 * shapr bounces cheerfully
00:28:50 <Darius> Obviously Ehud is a RecentChanges addict.
00:28:52 <shapr> who wrote that one?
00:29:02 <Darius> Wadler
00:29:08 <shapr> are you familiar with the term "quickChanges junkie" ?
00:29:34 <shapr> comes from http://c2.com/cgi-bin/quickChanges
00:29:39 <Darius> http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html
00:30:02 <Darius> shapr: Yes, that's what I was trying to think of/specializing to HaWiki.
00:30:13 <shapr> ah, excellent
00:31:13 <Darius> Also "Imperative Functional Programming" seems like another good milestone to add as it won the 2003 Most Influential POPL Paper award.
00:34:07 <shapr> neat, I didn't know SPJ was that influential in monads reaching Haskell.
00:34:20 <shapr> makes sense I guess, he's influential in every part of Haskell I've seen so far.
00:34:54 <shapr> wow, "Imperative Functional Programming" has been cited 223 times.
00:37:33 <adept> Darius: is it http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/peytonjones93imperative.html ?
00:37:35 <shapr> citeseer needs some improvements, I'd like to be able to browse along axes of each author and authors together
00:37:41 <shapr> http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/peytonjones93imperative.html
00:37:42 <shapr> yup
00:38:26 <shapr> essence - http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/wadler92essence.html
00:42:48 <shapr> Darius: I've added a bit to the page, any comments?
00:42:53 <shapr> @wiki StudyGroup
00:42:53 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/StudyGroup
00:48:02 <Darius> Well, as I was going to mention before I went and got a sandwich, there's a lot more to Category Theory than monads even limiting to Haskell, though I admit none are quite as blatant as monads.
00:48:15 <shapr> like what?
00:50:59 <Darius> point-free style, generalizations of folds and unfolds, and program calculation techniques
00:51:13 <shapr> hey, did you ever get darcs built on win32? or is it too painful?
00:51:31 <shapr> those sound like good paths to take after monads
00:51:45 <shapr> you could add those to the page
00:52:10 <Darius> I haven't gotten it to build, but I've put out very little effort.  However, others have apparently gotten it to work on Win32.
00:56:43 <shapr> I could also add it to the page
00:57:20 <shapr> Taaus: hello
00:57:36 * shapr always picks on the newbies
01:13:02 <shapr> hi Chimp
01:13:06 <shapr> how's code?
01:13:20 <Chimp> hi shapr, what's up?
01:14:04 <shapr> general happiness, ScannedInAvian.org is back up, meaning gforge.scannedinavian.org is up for testing, darcs is back, and there's also
01:14:07 <shapr> @wiki StudyGroup
01:14:07 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/StudyGroup
01:17:50 <shapr> what's up with you?
01:18:35 <Chimp> I'm cool. Won't be diving into Haskell in earnest until next week, but then I'll go for broke. Say, which book does the StudyGroup refer to?
01:19:07 <shapr> it's one of the Category Theory books, a nice grey book that several people here on #haskell own
01:19:40 <Chimp> could you give me the title? Maybe I could order it...
01:20:04 <shapr> all the info should be on that page.
01:20:20 <Chimp> I'll suck that page dry, then!
01:20:40 <Chimp> ah, "Conceptual Mathematics"...
01:30:22 <Darius> Did I ever mention how much I hate ML syntax?
01:30:39 <shapr> I'd have to agree with you, from the little bits I've seen.
01:31:02 <shapr> y0 harsha123` 
01:31:14 <harsha123`> wassup shapr ?
01:31:35 <shapr> general cheerfulness, have you seen http://gforge.scannedinavian.org/ ?
01:31:45 <harsha123`> lemme see
01:32:08 <shapr> darcs is back up, though I haven't put wiwiwi up again.
01:32:35 <harsha123> hmm... is it up? i can't connect to it
01:32:38 <Darius> it (gforge) doesn't eat your whole domain anymore does it?
01:32:55 <shapr> no, I fixed the apache config
01:33:19 <shapr> I haven't tried the umask hack for darcs though
01:33:21 <harsha123> not up? 
01:33:49 <shapr> eh?
01:34:04 <harsha123> hmm i can't connect to http://gforge.scannedinavian.org/ 
01:34:08 <shapr> I can
01:34:24 <shapr> anyone else?
01:34:29 <harsha123> nopes... i can't
01:34:44 <shapr> works from finland
01:34:48 * shapr tries from texas
01:34:57 <dennisb> Host http://gforge.scannedinavian.org/ not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
01:35:23 <shapr> works from texas
01:35:24 <dennisb> scannedinavian.org resolves
01:35:45 <shapr> and works from telia
01:35:48 <shapr> hm, strange
01:36:40 <dennisb> shapr: it takes time for dns servers to update
01:36:51 <shapr> yes, that's probably it.
01:36:56 <shapr> hi ejt 
01:37:24 <dennisb> in a couple of hours it will either not work anywhere or everywhere
01:37:30 <shapr> :-)
01:38:45 <ejt> hi shapr, how's it going ?
01:39:09 <shapr> harsha123: if you run "host gforge.scannedinavian.org scannedinavian.org" first, it may stuff your dns cache so that your web browser can get there.
01:39:38 <shapr> ejt: going well, new hardware online, old hardware repaired
01:39:52 <shapr> haven't written any Haskell in the last few days though
01:40:26 <ejt> me neither, I've been learning ocaml
01:41:00 <shapr> what do you think?
01:41:05 <ejt> and really annoying #ocaml by asking questions like: "where's the compose operator", "is there a Maybe monad?"
01:41:09 <shapr> heh
01:41:19 <ejt> it's not as bad as I feared
01:41:45 <shapr> from what I've seen it TaPL, I don't like the syntax much. Can't argue with the runtime performance, of course.
01:43:13 <shapr> I had a strange dream where I added a GHC backend that output OCaml source so that Haskell was the fastest functional programming language in the world.
01:43:14 <ejt> the compiler is quick too, and gives understandable error messages
01:43:14 * shapr has lots of weird dreams
01:43:14 <ejt> unsafeIO again ?
01:43:14 <shapr> heh, not this time
01:43:56 <shapr> I did have a dream about monads and continuation passing style, when I awoke I realized Riastradh (and others) have been trying to explain that to me for months (maybe years)
01:45:02 <shapr> I'm not sure what the equivalence is for arrows though
01:45:02 <ejt> what haskell projects are you working on ?
01:45:02 <Darius> Wow, I really wish I had such informative dreams.
01:45:02 <shapr> Darius: :-P you don't need them, you understand this stuff anyway.
01:45:33 <ejt> normally I interview politicians in my dreams; my fault for having a radio alarm clock
01:45:38 <shapr> haha!
01:47:01 <shapr> I tend to continue thinking about the same things in my dreams as in my waking hours, just that all the rules change when I'm asleep.
01:48:35 <shapr> Darius: what do you dream about?
01:49:34 <Darius> shapr: Of late I haven't been remembering them.
01:49:42 <mgoetze> i dream of mathematical proofs
01:49:49 <mgoetze> too bad i forget them just before waking up
01:52:37 <shapr> sometimes I've written down things I realized while I'm asleep. when I wake up, I mostly can't understand them, but occasionally they're really profound and brilliant.
02:21:50 * shapr bounces
02:22:41 <raver> y0 shapr!
02:22:48 <shapr> hi raver, how's code?
02:22:59 <raver> well
02:23:10 <raver> i had a functional programming exam next monday
02:23:13 <raver> sorry
02:23:16 <raver> i will have
02:23:32 <shapr> are you looking forward to it?
02:27:59 <raver> last monday we did a revision session
02:28:10 <raver> with past year exams
02:28:17 <raver> it not seemed so dificult
02:28:34 <raver> I hope to pass it :)
02:29:21 <shapr> sounds like you're prepared
02:35:15 <raver> i hope so
02:35:18 <raver> and also
02:35:31 <raver> in my coursework i had a 65 mark
02:35:41 <raver> the teacher said it's a good mark
02:35:43 <raver> :)
02:37:32 <raver> but when i saw the solution that he thought i realize what a newbie i am...
02:37:52 <raver> lol
02:38:20 <shapr> that happens to all of us
02:41:31 <phubuh> oh hey shapr, thanks for the description on HaWiki :-)
02:43:50 <shapr> sure ;-)
02:50:35 <Lunar^> *sigh*
02:50:50 <Lunar^> Just finished compiling GHC 6.2.. 2 days in background
02:51:04 <shapr> wow
02:51:04 <Lunar^> (on my iBook G3 800)
02:52:52 <shapr> I just realized that lambdabot doesn't really need user privs, can I make him su nobody like apache does su www-data ?
02:54:50 <Lunar^> Dunno if there's Haskell function
02:54:56 <Lunar^> to do that
02:55:54 <Lunar^> By the way : do you know how could I do something like Unix/C atexit() function ?
02:56:13 <Lunar^> f `finally` cleanUp doesn't seem to run cleanUp when I hit Ctrl+C
02:56:29 <harsha123> shapr: :-) gforge is cool ! heh?
02:56:37 <shapr> it's spiffy so far
02:57:10 <shapr> Lunar^: I think lambdabot has some code that specifically works with C-c
02:57:33 <Lunar^> shapr: I'll try to look
03:10:02 <ski> hi #haskell
03:10:45 <shapr> hello ski!
03:11:03 <ski> hi shapr
03:23:42 * ski chuckles
03:24:24 * Lunar^ is trying to make the Tux from the tutorial working
03:24:36 <Lunar^> Bus Error :(((
03:26:56 <Lunar^> Maybe createWindow should be called early on OS X
03:27:55 <Lunar^> I was right
03:30:05 <shapr> wxHaskell?
03:30:08 <shapr> or haSDL?
03:31:13 <Lunar^> HOpenGL
03:31:20 <shapr> oh
03:32:01 <Lunar^> On OS X, you have to do this : do getArgsAndInitialize ; initDisplayMode $= [...] ; createWindow "" ; ...
03:32:23 <Lunar^> Doing anything OpenGL related *before* createWindow generates a memory error
03:33:15 <Lunar^> Somthing similar happened to me when doing SDL, that's why that was my second try :)
03:33:27 <shapr> ah
03:34:04 <Lunar^> Now I'm going to help ned with his go game
03:34:16 <Lunar^> I'm going to see him this week-end :)
03:35:36 <shapr> ah cool
03:36:08 <Lunar^> shapr: print.squat.net in case of
03:36:32 <shapr> nice website
03:41:42 <Lunar^> http://lune.talath.net/~lunar/tux-hopengl.tiff
03:42:13 <shapr> nice!
03:44:24 <Lunar^> Now I need to find a game :)
03:45:02 <Lunar^> shapr: btw, I put you on the company's wish card list
03:45:16 <shapr> wish card list?
03:45:17 <Lunar^> shapr: Béatrice wasn't too hard to find ;)
03:45:29 <Lunar^> shapr: You know, the things you send on a new year
03:45:32 <shapr> oh!
03:45:34 <shapr> neat
03:45:53 <Lunar^> That's just a greeting card...
03:45:55 <Lunar^> going to eat
03:47:05 * shapr wants food also
03:56:16 <harsha123> shapr: is emacs-wget packaged? hmm..you know the package name?
03:59:02 <shapr> haven't heard of it
03:59:26 <harsha123> ok
04:41:09 <shapr> g'day seafood_
04:43:44 <Igloo> :q
04:43:48 <Igloo> Bah
04:43:57 <shapr> Igloo: cute
04:49:53 <earthy> schweet tux, lunar
04:50:05 <ham[kell]> hiho
04:56:18 <Igloo> Lunar^: If you're looking for a game then maybe http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/kb/for_6.2/ ?  :-)
04:57:12 <Lunar^> Igloo: thx
04:57:49 <shapr> is there a good reason that "ghc --make Foo" doesn't make an executable named Foo ?
04:58:22 <Igloo> Not sure. hmake Foo does, and you can ghc --make Foo -o Foo of course
04:58:45 <Lunar^> shapr: default to a.out
04:58:59 <shapr> why is a.out the default? wouldn't Foo be more sensible?
04:59:08 <keverets> for historic reasons, i believe
04:59:14 <Lunar^> shapr: Unix touch :(
04:59:17 <shapr> keverets: good historic reasons?
04:59:43 <keverets> gcc always did, as it created files of type a.out, named a.out, unless you told it not to.
05:00:27 <shapr> do people rely on that convention for some functionality? maybe configure scripts need ghc to do that?
05:00:48 <keverets> I doubt it for ghc... it might be the case for gcc.
05:02:56 <Lunar^> Igloo: 108.. quite fun
05:03:13 <Lunar^> Igloo: There's some bug when BadGuys appear near sides
05:03:56 <Igloo> Yeah, there are a number of those sorts of issues
05:04:02 <Igloo> But it's a start  :-)
05:10:03 <shapr> Igloo: I think I found a bug, not sure if it's a haddock bug. notice the links for IArray and UArray in http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data.Int.html go to the wrong place.
05:11:40 <shapr> looks like it has something to do with Data.Int import GHC.Int which imports GHC.Base which actually has the Array stuff.
05:13:15 <Lunar^> Is there any web browser in Haskell ?
05:13:46 <shapr> as far as I know, HTTP.hs is the closest, and it's not very close.
05:13:57 <shapr> would be interesting to write one
05:14:05 <Lunar^> I'm talking about a web browser, like Gecko or KHTML
05:14:05 <Igloo> Are you sure it's not just missed a file?
05:14:14 <Lunar^> web rendering engine
05:14:23 <Igloo> libraries/base/Data/Array/Base.hs does exist, in CVS at least
05:14:29 <shapr> oh, maybe so
05:14:52 <shapr> Igloo: ok then, I won't report it as a bug, thanks.
05:14:52 <Igloo> Probably best to mail SM or one of the gh MLs anyway
05:15:01 * shapr notes this is why he asks Igloo first
05:15:03 <Igloo> Well, it's still an online documentation bug at least
05:15:11 <Lunar^> Lazyness should be interesting for the positioning algorithm
05:15:27 <shapr> could be very powerful for positioning
05:15:30 <Igloo> And probably a bug in any docs generated by make doc too (e.g. ghc6-libsrc)
05:15:31 <shapr> or really painful
05:15:38 <Igloo> Err, ghc6-doc IM
05:16:05 <shapr> yah, ghc6-doc has the same bug, that's where I noticed it first.
05:16:36 <shapr> maybe you've heard "random stomping kills no bugs," I've discovered "random clicking finds many bugs"
05:16:53 <Lunar^> shapr: Ever eared of any paper talking about functional programming applied to positioning algorithm ?
05:17:01 <Lunar^> It's not a new idea
05:17:06 <shapr> no, do they exist?
05:17:31 <Igloo> There's John Hughes' text prettyprinter which isn't a mile off
05:17:35 <shapr> I wonder if the LaTeX position algorithms would be more elegant in Haskell
05:17:38 <shapr> oh, good point
05:17:53 <Igloo> You don't just want laziness, though. You want to alter the layout as more info becomes available
05:18:24 <Heffalump> whee, talk done
05:18:26 <shapr> arrows?
05:18:31 <Lunar^> Igloo: will look that one
05:18:34 <shapr> which talk?
05:18:39 <Heffalump> at POPL
05:18:43 <shapr> oh
05:18:52 <shapr> do you have pretty colors online?
05:19:04 <Heffalump> as in slides?
05:19:12 <shapr> or the talk itself, or etc
05:19:15 <Igloo> Cool - how'd it go?
05:19:30 <Heffalump> not sure. Oege said it was good but he always seems to think that.
05:19:42 <Heffalump> A few other people said they liked it, not sure if they were just being polite.
05:19:49 <Heffalump> it went roughly to plan, anyway
05:20:12 <Igloo> That's the problem with people  :-(
05:20:51 <Heffalump> well, some of them didn't have technical quetsions/comments, so had no reason to say anything to me at all
05:20:54 <Heffalump> but yeah
05:20:55 <shapr> I tend to say what I think, but that's often unpopular.

06:16:53 <SyntaxNinja> y0y0 shapr man
06:24:12 <shapr> hi tez 
06:24:25 <tez> hello
06:24:29 <shapr> what's up?
06:24:53 <tez> Not much here.
06:25:14 <shapr> written any cool code lately?
06:26:31 <tez> No, 'm afraid not.
06:26:55 <shapr> taking a break for christmas? :-)
06:27:32 <tez> Sure, something like that...
06:27:36 <tez> :-)
06:33:41 * SyntaxNinja doesn't see anything good for checking to see if a particular string is a substring of another. any advice?
06:35:29 * SyntaxNinja considers regex
06:35:33 <Igloo> You can do it inefficiently with any, tails and isPrefixOf
06:36:15 <SyntaxNinja> yuck
06:36:31 <phubuh> you can be slightly more effective by jumping more than 1 step when characters don't match
06:36:42 * SyntaxNinja is surprised that the Data.List doesn't have more string operations. OTOH, I'm also surprised that I've obviously seldom needed any
06:36:46 <Igloo> yuck? It's roughly the specification I'd give
06:37:26 <Igloo> phubuh: Yeah, but then it's not an ickle function  :-)
06:37:36 <phubuh> ickle?
06:37:50 <Igloo> If you care about efficiency google for Knuth-Morris-Pratt (or another one whose name I forget)
06:37:53 <Igloo> little
06:38:10 <shapr> someone on haskell@ recently wondered why Data.List doesn't have a subset function
06:38:27 <phubuh> there are a whole bunch of hairy algorithms involving precompilation and stuff, I seem to recall there being an example of one on the wiki
06:38:51 <Lunar^> Anyone tried to make a regexp system in Haskell ?
06:39:02 * Igloo wanted a Data."remove a random element and give it to me" the other day, so ended up with a list for that and a set for querying
06:39:04 <shapr> there's a regexp module
06:39:20 <Lunar^> shapr: It's a binding to libc, not an implementation in Haskell
06:39:26 <Lunar^> shapr: a lot of unsafePerformIO there ;)
06:39:38 <shapr> oh
06:47:09 <Lunar^> another project on the stack
06:47:10 <Lunar^> damn
06:47:16 <Lunar^> Does it ever stop growing ?
06:47:48 <Lunar^> We'll need that for hOp, because we don't want any libc function
06:48:00 <shapr> any progress on hOp?
06:48:40 <SyntaxNinja> substring :: String -> String -> Bool
06:48:40 <SyntaxNinja> substring s1 s2 = isJust $ matchRegex (mkRegex s1) s2
06:49:02 <SyntaxNinja> (it didn't take me 10 minutes, btw, I was away from my desk ;) )
06:49:22 <Lunar^> shapr: not for the moment, but I have sebc agreement to go on with his help
06:49:29 <Igloo> I'm sur eI should know what hOp is but, err, I don't  :-)
06:49:40 <shapr> hOp - haskell operating system
06:49:53 <Lunar^> shapr: mhh we can't say that exactly
06:49:54 <Igloo> Aha
06:49:58 <Lunar^> Igloo: Do you know JNode ?
06:50:01 <Igloo> No
06:50:09 <shapr> basically ghc rts on the bare metal
06:50:20 <Igloo> *nod*, I remember now
06:50:28 <shapr> I know that galois is interested in that sort of thing.
06:50:54 <Igloo> Writing a really inefficient regexp implementation on the first pass to get everything working is easy
06:51:13 <phubuh> some perl dude wrote a fun essay on how to implement regexes
06:51:18 <phubuh> mark j dominus?
06:51:20 <Lunar^> Igloo: jnode.sf.net ; they worked on an assembly JVM, which then is not so virtual
06:51:34 <Lunar^> Igloo: Now they're writing drivers in Java
06:51:51 <Lunar^> Igloo: hOp starting with that in mind : GHC's RTS is so much like a basic kernel
06:52:26 <phubuh> http://perl.plover.com/Regex/article.html
06:52:38 <shapr> LispM for Haskell
06:52:45 <shapr> that would be *fun*
06:52:56 <Lunar^> sebc already made a lot of work, but it stopped because he proved impossibility of writing a memory manager
06:53:01 <Lunar^> (lazyness in cause here)
06:53:29 <shapr> does the malloc need to be written under the rts?
06:53:37 <Lunar^> He would need to do that in C, and he doesn't want to write C at all
06:53:51 <Lunar^> shapr: Sure, RTS needs malloc
06:54:21 <Lunar^> So I'm younger and less fed up with C, so he's going to direct me... 
06:55:41 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: any thoughts on gforge so far? I like it, personally,.
06:56:06 <shapr> haven't had much time to play with it from the admin side.
06:56:19 <shapr> I want to figure out how to add a Haskell category to the snippets next
06:58:06 <Lunar^> shapr: would be happier if it used Darcs or tla instead of CVS
06:58:28 <shapr> that's also on my list
06:58:37 <Lunar^> pretty big list ;)
06:58:42 <shapr> I'm willing to hack on the PHP if I can add darcs support without too much trouble
06:59:05 <shapr> maybe I should wiki-ize that list, add it to the HaskellIrcChannel
06:59:20 <SyntaxNinja> I don't feel like CVS is all that highly integrated.  maybe in the summary and stuff, but htat's about it
06:59:27 <SyntaxNinja> (like to tell who's active)
06:59:58 <shapr> I won't argue until I've tried to add darcs support.
07:01:10 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: think I should create a gforge HaWiki page to solicit feedback and list possible issues?
07:01:55 <SyntaxNinja> sounds like a good idea.
07:02:05 <SyntaxNinja> I think we need ppl to try it too *hint* *hint*
07:02:28 <shapr> yah, I agree
07:02:31 <Igloo> It would be nice to have a few things in it before announcing it to the lists, I think
07:02:37 <Igloo> Dunno if there already is or not
07:02:41 <shapr> no, there's not
07:02:44 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: exactly
07:02:51 <shapr> so far SyntaxNinja has created a project, and I have
07:02:52 <Igloo> And having darcs before doing so would be cool too
07:02:56 <shapr> yes, I agree.
07:03:01 <Igloo> Ah, OK, I thought your hint was to mail the list  :-)
07:03:17 <shapr> I doubt I'll have time investigate darcs support before the weekend.
07:03:34 <Igloo> I don't think there's a desparate rush  :-)
07:04:12 <shapr> well, if it were already up, FGL could have gone in there.
07:04:38 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: fgl should probably be happy in its new home in the official cvs repo :)
07:04:50 <Lunar^> shapr: Do you know if David Roundy found time to make a better web interface ?
07:05:09 <shapr> I've only heard of the new wxHaskell interface to darcs
07:05:13 <shapr> I don't think he's changed the web interface.
07:05:27 <Lunar^> wxHaskell interface ?!
07:05:34 <Lunar^> Where's a screen shot ?
07:06:11 * shapr looks
07:09:02 <SyntaxNinja> so does anyone else have a little project they want to put on gforge to get some feedback?  I'm epecially interested to hear ppl's reactions to using our own server instead of sourceforge or gforge or whatever.
07:09:25 <shapr> There is an experimental GUI written using wxhaskell, although I'm not sure that it is what you are thinking of.  The GUI is still command-line driven, but it pops up a window allowing you to select patches or changes interactively, or in the case of record to also enter the patch name and comments interactively.
07:09:43 <Smerdyakov> "Put it on gforge and give feedback on using it instead of gforge"?
07:09:57 <shapr> Lunar^: doesn't sound very graphical. even so, there's a lot of interest in a better repo browser, and lots of discussion about it on the mailing list.
07:10:16 <Lunar^> shapr: I should subscribe then
07:10:31 <Lunar^> shapr: Maybe I could trade more sleeping hoursto help
07:10:36 <shapr> haha
07:10:51 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: heh
07:11:11 <shapr> Lunar^: your list is longer than mine :-)
07:11:23 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: you know what I mean.
07:11:50 <Lunar^> shapr: I'm talking talking talking, but not doing that much
07:12:01 <Smerdyakov> SyntaxNinja, not really. Is "gforge" also the name of a well-known site using that software?
07:12:01 <Lunar^> shapr: But let me dream of it, Plone is starting to get me really *mad*
07:13:36 <shapr> I understand
07:14:10 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: maybe not. I assumed gforge.org did project hosting. hardly matters.
07:14:46 <Lunar^> We should put hOp on gforge
07:14:53 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: it seems as though minor imprecision confuses you a great deal ;) 
07:14:55 <Igloo> SyntaxNinja: I will probably/hopefully have something in the not too distant future. "Our own" is better for me because there's less beaurocracy and there will be darcs
07:15:07 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: what is hOp? is this your project?
07:15:18 <shapr> Lunar^: good idea
07:15:31 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja: It's sebc's, and he's a pretty good friend. He introduced me to FP
07:15:36 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: yeah, I'm guessing that those are the major selling points.
07:15:57 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: I see.
07:15:58 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja: that was... 4 years ago
07:16:02 <Smerdyakov> I've never had a problem with "bureaucracy" on SF.
07:16:47 <Smerdyakov> The darcs reason makes sense, though.
07:17:05 <Smerdyakov> However, SF has a lot more to recommend it than just CVS, including lots of big iron and backup stuff!
07:17:35 <shapr> I wonder how many projects snowblind can host before needing more than 800MHz. I know 3GB free in /var won't last long, but I can add more drivespace soon.
07:18:22 <SyntaxNinja> backups are a good feature
07:18:27 <shapr> yes, I was thinking about that.
07:18:28 <SyntaxNinja> what's snowblind?
07:18:49 <SyntaxNinja> is sebc Sebastian?
07:19:10 <Lunar^> SyntaxNinja: Carlier
07:19:16 <shapr> snowblind is the hostname of the new colocated server 600MHz P3. raven is my other spare box, 800MHz Athlon
07:20:12 <shapr> it's possible I'll purchase a new desktop PC and colocate thunderbird. it's a dual 1544MHz Athlon MP, and it really needs a server room with air conditioners.
07:20:37 <Smerdyakov> Can anyone explain to me the perceived problems with bureaucracy at SF?
07:21:29 <SyntaxNinja> Lunar^: OK
07:22:29 <shapr> I'll see if I can come up with a solution for network backups.
07:23:49 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: it may be something you want anyway :)
07:23:59 <shapr> no argument there.
07:28:24 <Igloo> Smer: I spent about a month trying to get something set up with them. I got the impression I was unlucky and something broke, though
07:28:55 <Smerdyakov> Igloo, I've set up two projects without a hitch, so I think you are right.
07:28:58 <SyntaxNinja> I woke up with the biggest headache ever this morning :(
07:30:08 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: there are a couple more things: it would be nice keeping all the projects together, and I think that a sense of ownership by the community will increase support and enthusiasm.
07:30:31 <Smerdyakov> Well, to state the obvious, all together at SF is still all together. ;)
07:31:26 <Smerdyakov> And I think I page listing the community's SF projects could do just fine for giving a sense of ownership.
07:32:19 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: in what sense is "all together at SF still all together"?  it's a large community.
07:33:31 <Smerdyakov> Well, in the sense of my understanding of the phrase "all together," meaning every entity in a certain set is found within a certain container.
07:35:40 <SyntaxNinja> so by "state the obvious" maybe you meant "state the obviously missing the point"?  We're "all together" on the internet as it is, correct?
07:36:48 <shapr> I've had bureaucracy and bandwidth problems with sourceforge, and I believe that a gforge.haskell.org would be a good replacement for two things, 1) many parts of hslibs in fptools cvs could have their own source tree and 2) many haskell apps/libs have their own haskell.org/foo url
07:37:26 <shapr> and 3) people could request and admin these sorts of projects themselves.
07:38:06 <Smerdyakov> SyntaxNinja, yes. I think you could have used better phrasing for the "all together."
07:38:22 <Smerdyakov> shapr, have you had bandwidth problems recently?
07:38:27 <SyntaxNinja> wow emacs just segfaulted
07:39:05 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: were you confused by imprecision again?
07:39:27 <Smerdyakov> SyntaxNinja, no, I understood what you meant. I just like to point out when you say something other than what you mean.
07:41:25 <shapr> one spiffy prospect is that a haskell-oriented gforge could have LIP support!
07:41:25 <shapr> Haskell could have its own CPAN!
07:41:25 <shapr> now that I think of it, that would be a good feature for sourceforge also.
07:41:25 <shapr> the most recent HC&A report mentioned very specifically that the haskell.org admins would like to find some way for people to do self-admin of more information on haskell.org
07:42:19 <Smerdyakov> shapr, why is that more possible with your own site than with SF?
07:42:30 <SyntaxNinja> Smerdyakov: Why not point it out then, instead of acting confused?
07:42:38 <Smerdyakov> SyntaxNinja, I don't know.
07:54:36 <Heffalump> what does "gforge" mean?
07:54:56 <Igloo> sourceforge software, roughly
07:58:46 <shapr> if anyone here has PHP skills, I'll probably have a bunch of questions when I get to adding darcs support to gforge.
08:00:09 <Heffalump> proper CVS/darcs integration wants doing, methinks.
08:00:30 * Heffalump knows roughly how to do it, I just need to get it done :-)
08:04:29 <shapr> even semi-proper cvs/darcs integration might be enough that I could fake the darcs integration in gforge
08:06:44 <Heffalump> the key requirement is that you lock one repository while the other is being committed to
08:30:21 <Maddas> Hi
08:31:02 <SyntaxNinja> hi Maddas
08:32:36 <Maddas> Hm. Do you recommend any online resource (tutorial, book) in perticular when learning Haskell?
08:32:56 <Smerdyakov> "particular"
08:33:02 <Maddas> Particular, sorry
08:33:44 <shapr> Smerdyakov: you're the guy who doesn't actually write Haskell, right?
08:33:48 <shapr> @learn
08:33:48 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
08:34:00 <Maddas> Good day to you too, Smerdyakov :)
08:34:15 <shapr> Maddas: that's a good url to start with.
08:34:19 <Smerdyakov> shapr, I am one such guy. I have good evidence that I am not the only such person.
08:34:31 <Maddas> shapr: ok, I'll go for the gentle introduction then
08:35:18 <shapr> Maddas: I ended up learning from two of the books, the online intros weren't enough for me. Bear in mind, I didn't have much functional programming experience before that.
08:35:45 <Maddas> shapr: ok!
08:36:10 <shapr> feel free to ask questions here on #haskell, and check out the wiki too
08:36:14 <shapr> @wiki LearningHaskell
08:36:15 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/LearningHaskell
08:37:32 <Maddas> Thanks!
08:38:57 <shapr> do you have any questions right now?
08:39:24 <Maddas> Not yet
08:39:51 <shapr> ok
08:49:15 <phubuh> oh hi Maddas
08:50:06 <Maddas> hey phubuh 
08:50:08 <Maddas> How's your *mumble* client going?
08:50:28 <phubuh> direct connect?  not very well
08:50:38 <phubuh> it's not going -bad-, it's just, well, not really going at all
08:50:50 <phubuh> I do plan to work on it more thoguh
08:50:50 <Maddas> heh :)
08:51:13 <phubuh> http://www.phubuh.org/~phubuh/scout3.png :)
08:51:44 <Maddas> hah, cool :)
09:46:49 <shapr> @fortune
09:46:49 <lambdabot> It's not really a rule--it's more like a trend.
09:46:49 <lambdabot>              -- Larry Wall in <199710221721.KAA24321@wall.org>
09:46:53 <shapr> @fortune
09:46:53 <lambdabot> You must dine in our cafeteria.  You can eat dirt cheap there!!!!
10:15:34 <Maddas> List comprehensions are cool
10:15:56 <cptchaos> jip
10:16:11 <Darius> Not that this isn't so much later that no one knows what I'm refering to: but the Dynamic Lexer engine has regex support written in Haskell.
10:16:12 <cptchaos> i mean right
10:16:31 * Darius finds that he rarely uses list comprehensions.
10:16:44 * Darius thinks that he somewhat odd in that respect.
10:17:02 <ham[kell]> is anyone of you into group theory? and can tell me what the generators of (Z_p,*) are?
10:17:31 <phubuh> I'm with you... I don't think I've ever used them
10:17:36 <phubuh> except for playing around
10:17:42 <Smerdyakov> I understand your question, but I don't know the answer. :)
10:17:57 <ham[kell]> is anyone of you into group theory? and can tell me what the generators of (Z_9,*) are?
10:18:17 <Darius> Isn't p usually indicative of 'prime'?
10:18:28 <ham[kell]> er dang sry yes :)
10:18:38 <ham[kell]> (Z_7,*) ie
10:19:05 <ham[kell]> {0,1,2,3,5,7) ?
10:19:29 <ham[kell]> er damn
10:19:32 <ham[kell]> {0,1,2,3,5)
10:19:39 <cptchaos> :-)
10:20:02 <Smerdyakov> Well, I can tell you an easy algorithm to find the answers. :D
10:20:20 <ham[kell]> which is?
10:20:25 <Smerdyakov> Try all the possibilities.
10:20:36 <Smerdyakov> Keep multiplying by them until you hit a cycle.
10:20:38 <ham[kell]> but is that the generator set in that case?
10:20:46 <Smerdyakov> No.
10:20:54 <Smerdyakov> Clearly 0 does not generate all of Z_9.
10:20:56 <Smerdyakov> Same for 1.
10:21:07 <ham[kell]> ah ok
10:21:19 <ham[kell]> all the elements have to generate it
10:21:23 <Smerdyakov> What?
10:21:28 <ham[kell]> the group
10:21:36 <Smerdyakov> Why did you think 0 and 1 belonged in the set?
10:21:42 <shapr> Lunar^: ok, haskell regexes are found, what else is missing to mak hOp run?
10:22:11 <ham[kell]> Smerdyakov i thought that all combinations of the elements should in total be the group
10:22:28 <Smerdyakov> ham[kell], I understand a generator to be a _single_ element of the set.
10:22:33 <Smerdyakov> ham[kell], is that not what you're looking for?
10:22:57 <ham[kell]> Smerdyakov you are right you helped me getting the definition
10:54:24 <shapr> actually, darcs support may not be so difficult for gforge. I may be able to hack the per-user ssh public keys page into a per-group page, add some code to create a $PROJECT_NAME-darcs email address, the correct .forward, and give access to the repo from the project webpage dir
10:57:31 <shapr> that would leave out all the other cvs integration; browsing, activity, etc
10:58:33 <SyntaxNinja> that can come later
10:59:09 <SyntaxNinja> heh. debian is going to take over the world, it seems: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/debian-devel-200401/msg00313.html
10:59:37 <SyntaxNinja> this may be a solution to installing gforge on haskell.org ;)
11:00:11 <shapr> heh, could be
11:12:06 <Matt-W> That's very scary
11:28:29 <SamB> Matt-W: gforge, or debian taking over the world?
11:43:09 <Matt-W> SamB: that anybody might want to install Debian over Gentoo like that
12:49:43 <Lunar^> shapr: Found wher ?
12:49:51 <Lunar^> shapr: hOp really need a MMU for the moment
12:50:01 <Lunar^> shapr: then some drivers I think... sebc will now better than me
12:53:30 <Darius> Lunar^: The regex library? http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/HaskellLexer/
12:54:34 <Lunar^> Cool
12:55:23 <shapr> Lunar^: can you get a hOp.tgz that includes the web pages sebc had online?
12:56:25 <Lunar^> shapr: I will ask sebc when he will have enough time (after his next paper deadline)
12:57:20 <Lunar^> We'll open a project on your gforge :)
12:57:34 <Lunar^> He agreed few hours ago
12:58:16 <shapr> yay!
12:58:25 <shapr> a *real* project!
12:58:33 <Lunar^> :)
12:59:02 <Lunar^> I need to study JNode's drivers
12:59:11 <Lunar^> They're quite well documented
13:02:58 <Lunar^> Chris Lattner's history is quite impressive
13:03:56 <shapr> yes
13:06:08 <Lunar^> Maybe HE would be interested in hOp
13:06:09 <Lunar^> ;
13:06:11 <Lunar^> ;)
13:06:59 <shapr> you could ask him
13:07:45 <Lunar^> I hardly wants to share this :( sebc's special ;)
13:08:00 <shapr> you don't have to
13:09:25 <Lunar^> Chris Lattner's working on LLVM !
13:16:29 <Lunar^> I wonder how JNode handles GC
13:16:38 <Lunar^> Does it stop the whole OS ?
13:41:58 <Maddas> hm, shapr, you around?
13:48:14 <shapr> Maddas: doing homework, what's up?
13:49:28 <Maddas> what exactly does this mean fib@(1:tfib) = something
13:49:49 <shapr> it's a named pattern match
13:50:02 <phubuh> that's like "as" in ocaml, it matches the parenthesized thing, and also binds the whole thing to fib
13:50:49 <shapr> for example, in a function like "foo (x:xs) = x + foo xs" the (x:xs) part means it takes a list, bind the first item of the list to x, and the rest of the list to xs
13:50:56 <phubuh> so if you have foo@(1 + bar) = e, then in e, bar will be some number, and foo will be 1 + bar
13:51:48 <shapr> Maddas: does that explain it?
14:01:03 <Maddas> sorry, shapr and phubuh.
14:01:24 <Maddas> Yes, thank you very much. My connection is very flaky, dropped right after I asked my question (and three more times in the meantime).
14:01:44 <Maddas> (Good that my proxy keeps logs)
14:02:02 <Darius> There are logs for the channel.
14:02:30 <Maddas> Heh, ok.
14:37:11 * SamB is surprised ghci cares about inlinable code
14:37:44 <Darius> What do you mean?
14:39:12 <SamB> well, it sometimes complains when you try to load a module from source if that module depends on compiled modules whose interface files contain code that manipulates unboxed tuples.
14:44:02 <SamB> the worst part is that the source doesn't even mention unboxing
15:48:31 * Igloo is disturbed by
15:48:34 <Igloo>     libraries/base/GHC   Handle.hs
15:48:36 <Igloo>   (Hugs only) add hIsTerminalDevice, hGetEcho and hSetEcho.
19:07:55 <SyntaxLaptop> kosmikus|away: did you have any luck w/ my software? :)
19:08:19 <SyntaxLaptop> isn't the lgpl on a debian system somewhere?
19:27:52 <SyntaxLaptop> anyone know of any pointers on phantom types?
19:31:29 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: There are a few around.
19:31:48 <Pseudonym> Let's have a think.
19:32:53 <Pseudonym> SyntaxLaptop: Is there something specific you're interested in?
19:34:59 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: I'm curious to understand GHC's extension for "Data types with no constructors"
19:35:29 <Pseudonym> Have you had a look at the physics directory in haskell-libs?
19:36:05 <Pseudonym> Incidentally, phantom types don't have to be types with no constructors.
19:37:12 <Smerdyakov> The Tibetan monks devote their lives to trying all possible names of the phantom types. If they ever get it right, the world will come to an end.
19:38:04 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: I figured that out so far :)
19:38:12 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: what are they useful for?
19:38:35 <Pseudonym> For guaranteeing well-formedness, mostly.
19:38:48 <Pseudonym> As an example, consider STRefs.
19:38:59 <Pseudonym> You want to ensure that STRefs don't get used in the wrong ST monad.
19:39:46 <Pseudonym> That's a kind of well-formedness constraint.
19:40:50 <Pseudonym> runST :: (forall s . ST s a) -> a
19:41:06 <Pseudonym> newSTRef :: a -> ST s (STRef s a)
19:41:10 <Pseudonym> readSTRef :: STRef s a -> ST s a
19:41:27 <Pseudonym> Here, s is a variable which serves no other purpose than to ensure that STRefs only get used in the same ST monad.
19:41:59 <Pseudonym> (Well, not quite no other purpose.)
19:42:05 <Pseudonym> (But close enough.)
19:42:20 * SyntaxLaptop thinks
19:42:49 <Pseudonym> If you look at readSTRef, for example, the type system ensures that "s" in the STRef is the same as "s" in the ST monad.
19:43:00 <Pseudonym> Even though there are no values of type "s" stored in either the STRef or the ST monad.
19:43:02 <SyntaxLaptop> right
19:43:05 <Darius> There's also
19:43:08 <Darius> @wiki PhantomTypes
19:43:09 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/PhantomTypes
19:43:37 <SyntaxLaptop> that was blank when I looked 10 minute ago :)
19:45:13 <Darius> perhaps you went to PhantomType?
19:45:20 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: but doesn't the "a" do that for you?
19:45:45 <Pseudonym> No.  a is the, in STRef, the type of the thing that the STRef points to.
19:45:59 <Pseudonym> And in ST, it's the type of the value returned by "return".
19:46:07 <Pseudonym> Compare with IORefs to see what I mean.
19:46:33 <Pseudonym> If there were multiple IOs which had to be kept distinct, the IO type as it is now wouldn't enforce that for you.
19:48:40 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: so it the 's' makes sure it's acutally the same reference, the 'a' makes sure it's the same type?
19:48:50 <SyntaxLaptop> Darius: yeah, that's what I did. liink from FundamentalConcepts is wrong :)
19:48:54 <Pseudonym> Right.
19:49:16 <Pseudonym> Or, more tothe point, "s" makes sure that the reference is taken from the same ST monad.
21:08:19 <SyntaxLaptop> Pseudonym: thanks for the tips. ttyl
