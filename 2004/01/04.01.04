02:13:46 <ejt> morning
06:05:19 <ham[let]> hiho
06:06:31 <ham[let]> is anyone in here familiar with process algebra?
06:06:48 <ham[let]> and is there any proof system for haskell?
06:35:53 <Darius> There are several process algebras. As for you're second question, I don't think so.  There is a proof assistant, Yarrow, that's written in Haskell.  However, you may want to look at Sparkle for Clean.
06:38:26 <ham[let]> is there anything on haskell and process algebras?
06:38:44 <ham[let]> Darius are you a bit into process algebras?
06:41:36 <Darius> Not really to my knowledge though I'm not sure what you are looking for.  As far as my knowledge of process algebras I've looked at the pi-calculus some and a little bit at others, but I don't have any immediate use for them.
06:44:10 <ham[let]> i just wondered if there is some algebra which is able to describe asyncronous processes
06:44:37 <ham[let]> since it would be really hard to put them into a formula
09:41:44 <shapr> y0
12:35:35 <shapr> w00
12:35:38 <shapr> excitement!
12:35:50 <Igloo> Oh?
12:35:58 <ejt> ?
12:36:16 <shapr> yes, christmas presents!
12:36:23 <shapr> books, music, games
12:36:30 <andersca> hey hey shapr
12:36:33 <shapr> hej andersca 
12:36:38 <phubuh> Yay
12:36:45 <shapr> I have the björk live box set to listen to
12:37:03 <shapr> I watched the DVD, it was nice
12:37:14 <shapr> phubuh: what did you get for Xmas?
12:37:21 <phubuh> bjork is awesome
12:37:56 <shapr> good coding music
12:38:02 <Igloo> Cool - delayed because of trip, or overseas shipping, or what?
12:38:45 <phubuh> that categorytheory book we were talking about 
12:38:48 * Igloo got lots of cool music CDs and some piano sheet music amongst other stuff  :-)
12:39:16 <shapr> Igloo: delayed because of the distributed nature of Christmas this year
12:39:28 <shapr> france, belgium, then sweden was last
12:39:42 <shapr> phubuh: how far have you gotten?
12:39:45 <Igloo> *nod*
12:39:58 <phubuh> and "thselfish gene"
12:40:26 <shapr> oh, I've heard of that one
12:40:30 <shapr> Dawkins?
12:40:40 * ejt remembers reading it in the late eighties ;)
12:40:41 <shapr> Igloo: what CDs did you get?
12:41:23 <shapr> richard dawkins maybe? I don't think I've read it, is it cool?
12:41:28 <phubuh>  to the stage when i wait for it to ship
12:41:39 <phubuh> yeah
12:42:21 <shapr> oh, we got some TV stuff too, first season of both Twin Peaks and 24
12:42:28 <shapr> but that's mostly for Bea
12:42:41 <Igloo> Monkees definitive collection LE (or similar), Grease (CD+DVD), Beatles (red+blue albums), Metaloaf (very best of I think), a Gilbert 'n Sullivan collection
12:42:53 <phubuh> I'm typing so slowly because I'm using dasher
12:43:46 <Igloo> And an instrumental queen CD, but the bits I've listened to so far haven't been great IMO
12:43:52 <phubuh> Monkeyes rule
12:44:05 <Igloo> Yeah  :-)
12:44:08 <shapr> Bea recently got the Grease DVD
12:44:13 <Igloo> # Then i saw her face
12:44:30 <phubuh> And I say that as a teenager
12:44:32 <shapr> I was impressed with the dancing skills of what's his name
12:44:47 * Igloo is 23
12:44:53 <Igloo> Have you seen any of the TV shows?
12:44:55 <shapr> I'm 32!
12:45:02 <ejt> snap
12:45:03 <shapr> Grease TV shows?
12:45:09 <Igloo> Monkees
12:45:13 <shapr> oh
12:45:17 <shapr> not me
12:45:34 <Igloo> John Travolta probably?
12:45:35 <shapr> ejt: how old are you?
12:45:39 <shapr> Igloo: yah! that's him
12:45:39 <ejt> 32
12:45:42 <phubuh> For some reason I thought you were like fifty
12:45:48 <shapr> who, me?
12:45:57 <shapr> or Igloo?
12:46:19 <phubuh> Igloo
12:46:22 <phubuh> :-)
12:46:31 <shapr> Igloo has a large collection of useful FP knowledge, so I guess I understand that :-)
12:46:32 * Igloo isn't sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing  :-)
12:46:45 <phubuh> yeah, I guess I was subconciously basing it on that :-)
12:47:23 * Igloo is a bit surprised the Monkees are known outside of the UK
12:47:37 <phubuh> Have you tried dasher?
12:48:22 <shapr> I think the Monkees were popular in the US in the 60s
12:48:29 <shapr> ejt: are you a professional programmer?
12:48:35 <phubuh> I thought they were really famous
12:49:05 <ejt> shapr: y, I work for Redhat as of 3 weeks ago (they bought Sistina)
12:49:37 <shapr> wow, neat!
12:51:17 <Igloo> Oh, IM UK+US. I guess there's no particular reason why they shouldn't be, though
12:52:26 <phubuh> They're known inSweden
13:13:02 * shapr reads darcs documentation
13:13:54 <shapr> I wonder where the test script stuff is documented
13:15:41 <shapr> hm, I just realized I could be using my local darcs repo just as if it were the canonical haskell-libs darcs repo
13:15:50 <shapr> I don't need a central server at all.
13:16:02 * shapr kicks himself out of the rut of CVS thinking
13:16:20 <Igloo> Heh
13:18:22 <shapr> aha, add a file named darcs_test to your repo, darcs will execute that script when checking the repo, after recording new code, etc
13:18:44 <shapr> or use setpref to specify which script to execute
13:28:15 <shapr> was it Programatica that was the Haskell editor that had the 'certificates' you could add to code?
13:28:32 <shapr> those certificates could be unit tests, proofs, whatever
13:28:46 <shapr> There was a demo at the Haskell Workshop, but I'm not sure if it was Programatica
13:29:37 <shapr> or was it the other editor?
13:29:38 <shapr> fooey
13:48:47 <door> hi, im totally new to haskell and one thing is confusing me when using hugs. why won't shortPalindrome = "ERE" work? the tutorial im reading says it should :)
13:49:32 <door> that is, assigning a variable with var = "aoeu"
13:52:20 <phubuh> it does but you can only do it once
13:52:37 <Igloo> You can't do it at the hugs prompt, you must put it in a file and load the file with hugs
13:53:13 <Cale> all that hugs does is evaluate expressions - you can't make new declarations.
13:53:50 <door> ah.. "<expr>  evaluate expression" <- from :? in hugs; thought that would work with declarations as well :) thanks
14:10:56 <ejt> door: with ghci you can use 'let' to set values
14:40:53 <shapr> hej door 
14:41:50 <shapr> vi bjuder dig till #haskell.se också, men det har inte så mycket människor.
14:42:08 <andersca> men vi Ã¤r snÃ¤lla
14:42:20 <shapr> yah, we're totally spiffy
14:42:41 <shapr> jpg: dude, you should upgrade to jp2 aka jpeg2000
14:44:14 <Cale> heh
14:44:25 <Cale> that's his initials
14:44:50 <door> shapr: hallå :) 
16:13:55 <Pseudonym> @yow
16:13:56 <lambdabot> Your CHEEKS sit like twin NECTARINES above a MOUTH that knows no BOUNDS --
16:16:41 <Pseudonym> Anyone else read Paul Graham's latest essay?
16:17:17 <darius-> yep
16:17:28 <Pseudonym> Something occurred to me a few months ago.
16:17:30 <darius-> what's your favorite future moral monstrosity of the past?
16:17:32 <Pseudonym> Paul talks about labels.
16:17:47 <Pseudonym> Do you know what I think the absolute worst label is, these days?
16:17:53 <darius-> no...
16:17:57 <Pseudonym> "Typical"
16:18:17 <Pseudonym> One of the worst insults you can level at someone is to call them "typical".
16:18:26 <darius-> i think that's pretty tame :)
16:18:40 <phubuh> Oh yay, new paul stuff
16:18:41 <Pseudonym> Usually qualified.  "Typical sexist."  "Typical conservative."  "Typical liberal."
16:18:46 <Pseudonym> Whatever.
16:18:57 <Pseudonym> "Typical Microsoft user."  "Typical procedural programmer."
16:19:47 <darius-> when newspaper columnists are calling everyone traitors, i can't get excited about typical
16:19:54 <Pseudonym> Well, true.
16:20:02 <Pseudonym> But that's typical media for you.
16:20:14 <darius-> only recent typical media, i think
16:20:38 <Pseudonym> The problem there is one of debate polarisation.
16:20:47 <Pseudonym> Which is something that I truly hate.
16:21:03 <Pseudonym> And it's one of the big moral monstrosoties of all eras.
16:21:11 <darius-> yeah, that's certainly a big part of it
16:21:23 <Pseudonym> Someone comes out with an extreme opinion, and all of a sudden it's impossible to have a rational debate.
16:21:43 <Pseudonym> Like today, it's almost impossble to hold a rational debate about, say, the MIddle East.  Or Israel's foreign policy.
16:21:54 <Pseudonym> Or US foreign policy, for that matter.
16:22:20 * darius- nods
16:22:38 <Pseudonym> Someone cries "wolf" and it's impossible to rationally discuss whether or not there really are dangerous animals in the woods.
16:23:24 <Pseudonym> Paul's essay also reminded me of "The Diamond Age".
16:23:46 <Pseudonym> Neal Stephenson made a few interesting observations in there.
16:23:54 <darius-> heh, i was just thinking nanotech's another thing
16:24:04 <Pseudonym> He asserted, for example, that one of the biggest insults of the modern era is "hypocrite".
16:24:11 <Pseudonym> Which makes sense when you think about it.
16:24:12 <darius-> that it's hard to get clear-eyed views of
16:24:55 <Pseudonym> There are almost no moral absolutes these days, not like in previous generations.  So the only basis on which you can feel superior to someone else is if they don't live up to their own ideals.
16:25:06 <Pseudonym> Which is ridiculous.  If you could live up to them, the wouldn't be "ideal".
16:25:15 <Smerdyakov> Didn't you say this before?
16:25:22 <Pseudonym> Probably.
16:25:27 * darius- finds little to argue with here, sorry :)
16:25:30 <Pseudonym> It's one of my favourite soapbox topics.
16:25:44 <Smerdyakov> Whoever said it before, I responded by saying that I feel superior to people for other reasons. :)
16:25:49 * Pseudonym grins
16:26:25 <Pseudonym> It's interesting because Neal Stephenson's take on the Victorian era is actually far more compassionate than is trendy these days.
16:26:42 <Pseudonym> Victorians actually were quite permissive.  Just so long as it wasn't in public.
16:26:53 <Pseudonym> The biggest sin was causing a scandal.
16:27:00 <Pseudonym> Apart from that, you could do what you wanted, pretty much.
16:27:18 <darius-> imho the biggest sin was writing those treacly victorian novels :)
16:27:27 <Pseudonym> Oh, that's true.  Ugh.
16:27:50 <Pseudonym> It's a shame we don't have the same sense of whimsy and nonsense these days, though.
16:27:51 <phubuh> I like how paul uses the word diff
16:27:57 <darius-> i was just enjoying Jo Walton's _Tooth and Claw_ - neat take on that
16:28:04 <Pseudonym> Oh?
16:28:06 * Pseudonym makes a note
16:28:17 <darius-> it's a victorian novel with dragons instead of humans
16:28:28 <darius-> works a lot better for a different species
16:28:46 <Pseudonym> Oh, kind of like "Flatland", being a Victorian novel with geometrical shapes instead of humans?
16:29:12 <darius-> hm, kind of, but i think it does it more seriously
16:29:20 <Pseudonym> OK.
16:29:21 <darius-> flatland was about the math more than anything else
16:29:23 <Pseudonym> Must look that one up.
16:29:28 <darius-> while this is a real story
16:29:38 <Pseudonym> I disagree, actually.  I think Flatland was more about the satire.
16:29:46 <Pseudonym> The maths was just an excuse, IMO.
16:29:52 <darius-> well, it's been 15 years since i read it - perhaps so
16:30:01 <Pseudonym> Must read it again to see.
16:31:28 <darius-> "It has been baldly stated in this narrative that Penn and Sher were friends at school and then at the Circle, and you have, being gentle readers, and not cruel and hungry readers who would visit a publisher's offices with the intention of rendin
16:31:39 <darius-> rending and eating an author who had displeased them, taken this matter on trust."
16:31:46 * Pseudonym laughs
16:32:31 <Smerdyakov> I bet that's got nothing on Thomas Pynchon.
16:32:43 * Pseudonym needs to read more Pynchon
16:32:49 <darius-> i read a bit of pynchon's _V_ but couldn't get into it
16:32:49 <Smerdyakov> In Gravity's Rainbow, I'm at the story of the society of the lightbulbs and the one immortal light bulb who was born among them.
16:33:13 <darius-> i should probably try him again since people compare him to stephenson
16:33:22 <darius-> or rather the other way 'round
16:34:16 <Smerdyakov> You know what.... I need to read something by Stephenson just to be able to form an opinion of him to recite at times like this.
16:34:44 <Pseudonym> Definitely.  Then you wouldn't be an ignoramus.
16:35:03 <Smerdyakov> From what I know, I'm inclined to guess that I wouldn't like his books.
16:40:24 <Pseudonym> OK, here's something I disagree with.,
16:40:30 <Pseudonym> "most physicists could, if necessary, make it through a PhD program in French literature"
16:40:44 <Pseudonym> I find that highly doubtful.
16:41:04 <Pseudonym> First off, academia in the arts is very different from academia in the sciences.
16:41:18 <darius-> i wondered about that too
16:41:20 <Pseudonym> Most science majors that I know can't write essays.
16:42:09 <Pseudonym> Secondly, aptitude is about 10% talent and about 90% sweat.
16:42:22 <Pseudonym> Take learning Haskell, for example.
16:42:29 <Pseudonym> You need some grounding in programming, in maths etc.
16:42:45 <Pseudonym> But more than anything else, you need to play with it.  A lot.
16:42:48 <darius-> science major != professional physicist, fwiw
16:42:53 <Pseudonym> This is true.
16:43:09 <Pseudonym> I've read physics papers, though.  They're not essays.
16:43:37 <darius-> that's an unfortunate effect of the journal system
16:43:42 <darius-> not that that means they can write
16:44:03 <Pseudonym> Raw talent and raw intellect means very little if you're not interested enough to put in a lot of hours.
16:44:43 <Pseudonym> You may have a huge amount of raw talent as a painter, for example.  But you still need to put in a lot of hours studying other paintings, learning technique and so on.
16:44:48 <darius-> as i said, i thought that was kind of a dubious statement too
16:44:53 * Pseudonym nods
16:45:14 <Pseudonym> I think the latter assertion is more true.
16:45:20 <darius-> anyway, phd in french lit has little to do with writing, i suspect
16:45:30 <Pseudonym> Yes, that's true.
16:45:47 <Pseudonym> I find that there are people able to analyse art and people who are unable.
16:45:59 <Pseudonym> My wife is a fine art major, so I happen to know this.
16:46:14 <Pseudonym> She spots things that I never do, and when she points them out, I say "yeah, that's true".
16:46:37 <Pseudonym> It's clear in retrospect, but it's not obvious unless you've got the appropriate talent and training.
16:46:42 <darius-> right, i've enjoyed reading discussions on rec.arts.sf.written or wherever but wouldn't have much to contribute
16:46:47 <Pseudonym> Precisley.
16:47:26 <darius-> otoh i could probably be decent at it with enough work
16:47:39 <Pseudonym> Yes, that's the other thing.  Sweat makes up for a lot.
16:47:55 <Pseudonym> My brother is not a computer scientist by any means, but he can churn out a decent script when necessary.
16:47:59 <Pseudonym> Because he's done it a lot.
16:49:10 <darius-> it's almost annoying how much wisdom i learned the hard way has been codified into this extreme programming stuff
16:49:19 <Pseudonym> Yes!
16:49:23 <Pseudonym> I thought that too.
16:49:39 <darius-> damn newbies :)
16:49:43 <Smerdyakov> Pseudonym, your use of "but" is confusing: are you implying that it's odd for non-computer scientists to be good at writings cripts?
16:49:46 <Pseudonym> In fact, apart from pair programming, it struck me a few years ago how close XP is to open source "bazaar" development.
16:50:12 <Pseudonym> Smerdyakov: No, not at all.  Rather, I'm explaining why non-computer scientists can be good at writing scripts.
16:50:27 <Pseudonym> Despite not fully appreciating what underlies what they are doing.
16:50:36 <Pseudonym> People do it every day.
16:50:50 <Pseudonym> I drive a car despite not understanding how an automatic transmission works.
16:51:18 <Smerdyakov> "Not fully appreciating".... hmph.
16:53:36 <phubuh> I wish it was easier to do pair programming without physical proximity.
16:54:10 <darius-> anyone tried kansas or nebraska?
16:54:16 <esap> I've never understood what's the purpose of pair programming. When I tried it, it didn't seem to do any good for the project.
16:54:50 <darius-> i enjoyed informal pair programming on occasion before XP came around
16:55:02 <phubuh> I've done pair programming with my brother for ages
16:55:09 <darius-> two brains better than one, a lot of the time
16:55:24 <phubuh> yeah, and it helps me stay motivated to do things the Right Way
16:55:44 <darius-> keeps you from sitting around on irc instead of coding :)
16:55:52 <phubuh> that's a huge one too :-)
16:56:10 <phubuh> and of course, it spots silly little errors
16:56:16 <esap> The point where it breaks is when one of the persons says "Now you've been coding all day, now what should I do?" .-9
16:56:20 <phubuh> it being my brother :-)
16:56:33 <darius-> speaking of XP, i've just put together a semi-port of quickcheck to common lisp and python
16:56:46 <darius-> heh
16:56:49 <phubuh> darius-, whoa, that's awesome
16:57:17 <darius-> i'll put up a webpage tonight i think
16:57:22 <phubuh> nifty
17:05:34 <darius-> preview at nym> People do it every day.
17:05:39 <darius-> er sorry
17:05:47 <darius-> at http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/software/clickcheck.html
17:06:13 <darius-> still need to write up description, documentation, license, etc.
18:26:53 <`John> what's the way to get a simple hex to dec calc running in haskell?
18:38:38 <Cale> you can use showHex and readHex in Numeric
18:39:54 <Cale> Prelude Numeric> showHex 5439 ""
18:39:54 <Cale> "153f"
18:40:30 <Cale> Prelude Numeric> readHex "ffff"
18:40:30 <Cale> [(65535,"")]
18:42:04 <Cale> you might make bindings for (fst.head.readHex) and (flip showHex "")
19:13:50 <`John> what's the way to start that up with Numeric? 
19:16:03 <Cale> you can load ghci then type :module + Numeric
19:16:20 <Cale> or make an hs file that imports Numeric.
19:19:10 <`John> alot of typing but thanks Cale.
19:19:41 <Cale> it's probably best to make a little .hs with definitions for showHex and readHex
19:20:06 <Cale> (I mean, for  (fst.head.readHex) and (flip showHex "") really)
19:20:33 <Cale> and then you can just load that file when you want a hex/dec calculator.
19:21:08 <Darius> or you can just type 0xFFFF and look at the result.
19:21:55 <Cale> but going the other way, you'll still need showHex
20:58:29 <stepcut> parsing command line arguments is a nightmare
22:45:34 <mattam> @def hGetLine
22:45:35 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "def", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
22:45:45 <mattam> @definition hGetLine
22:45:45 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "definition", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
22:48:18 <Cale> lambdabot: @listcommands
22:48:18 <lambdabot> I react to the following commands: ["all-dicts","arr","define","definitions","del-definition","devils","dict","dict-help","dummy","dump","dynamic-load","dynamic-reload","dynamic-unload","easton","echo","elements","eval","foldoc","fortune","gazetteer","get-definition","goodbye","hello","hitchcock","jargon","join","karma","karma+","karma-","leave","listchans","listcommands","listmodules","lojban","more","msg","part","prelude","quit","reconne
22:48:41 <Pseudonym> @type hGetLine
22:49:38 <mattam> i got an error message
22:49:41 <Pseudonym> I think.
22:49:44 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
22:49:50 <Pseudonym> @prelude hGetLine
22:49:51 <lambdabot> ERROR: connect: does not exist (Connection refused)
22:49:52 <mattam> ERROR: connect: does not exist (Connection refused)
22:49:56 <Pseudonym> Aha.
22:50:07 <mattam> he
22:50:34 <mattam> nm
22:50:43 <Cale> hGetLine :: Handle -> IO String
22:52:11 <Pseudonym> Oh, yeah, cheat why don't you.
22:54:21 <mattam> well, it's only the definition that i would like to see
22:54:36 <`John> @karma+
22:54:37 <lambdabot> I can't find the karma of nobody.
22:55:44 <Cale> I suppose you could build it fairly easily from hGetChar
22:59:44 <Cale> hGetLine' h = do
22:59:44 <Cale> 	c <- hGetChar h
22:59:44 <Cale> 	if c == '\n' then return [] else do
22:59:44 <Cale> 		cs <- hGetLine' h
22:59:44 <Cale> 		return (c:cs)
23:04:52 <mattam> yeah, i wanted to check if it was tail recursive and if it accepted '\r' as a line ender
23:28:26 <Cale> Oh, i dunno
