02:36:21 <cptchaos> good Morning all
04:40:46 <rey[lx]> hey guys
04:40:48 <rey[lx]> =)
04:41:40 <phubuh> hey dude
04:44:32 <rey[lx]> got a little prob with overloading
04:45:40 <rey[lx]> in good old c++ i could have a function bool bla(int,int); and an other bool bla(float, char); no matter what the functions did, this was principally alright
04:46:05 <rey[lx]> but it does not seem as if i could do this in haskell
04:46:33 <rey[lx]> i tried bla :: Int -> Int -> Bool
04:46:43 <rey[lx]> bla= do anything and return a bool
04:47:08 <rey[lx]> and: bla :: Float -> Float -> Bool
04:47:18 <rey[lx]> bla= do anything with two floats and return a bool
04:48:28 <rey[lx]> is there any way to overload functions like this? so i can define how for example the + or * operator behaves on self defined types?
04:49:33 <Vulpyne> http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/moretypes.html
04:49:58 <rey[lx]> thx =)
04:50:04 <Vulpyne> No problem.
04:50:20 <Vulpyne> Other chapters from that tutorial (linked from haskell.org) may be useful to you also.

06:55:02 <Vulpyne> Hi.
10:06:29 <Maddas> Humm
10:06:38 <phubuh> hum hum
10:06:41 <ski> Homm
10:06:41 <Maddas> Is the Parsec library too much for a beginner?
10:07:05 <phubuh> you might not understand how it works, but it's pretty easy to use
10:07:20 <Maddas> I'll give it a try then :)
10:07:31 <Maddas> What should I look at for retrieving web pages?
10:07:38 <phubuh> see http://www.phubuh.org/~phubuh/Message.ps for an example :-)
10:07:54 <Maddas> (Trying to build a simple spider getting some content and processing (sorting) it)
10:07:59 <Maddas> ok :)
10:08:27 <phubuh> http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/warrickg/haskell/http/ perhaps
10:08:46 <Maddas> thanks (I guess I should have googled)
10:09:04 <phubuh> http://www.haskell.org/libraries/ is also a good resource
10:09:31 <Maddas> ok, I'll check that from now on
10:14:42 <phubuh> Maddas: I updated the aligning, so if you downloaded the postscript file, download it again :)
10:14:52 <Maddas> ok :)
11:46:20 <ecraven> c
11:47:26 <ski> ?
11:47:37 <ecraven> pardon
11:47:43 <ecraven> should have been /c (clear)..
13:03:11 <shapr> it's oh so quiet...
13:03:15 * shapr sings björk
13:03:22 * Riastradh explorbs loudly.
13:03:42 <shapr> I like this "how to do struct in Haskell" discussion on haskell@
13:04:02 <Riastradh> Are there any good file system-independent file system libraries for Haskell that I can steal ideas from while designing my Scheme one?
13:04:17 <shapr> you can look at Directory
13:04:17 <phubuh> I want to suggest that people take a look at Erlang's bit syntax, but my mail server is misbehaving
13:04:27 <shapr> what is erlang's bit syntax?
13:04:35 <Riastradh> phubuh, join the club.
13:04:39 <shapr> I've used python's struct module, but nothing more.
13:04:49 <Riastradh> shapr, which is where...?
13:05:06 <shapr> it's in the standard libs
13:05:13 <shapr> look at the GHC hierarchical docs
13:05:15 <phubuh> you can pattern match on binary data... I'll dig up an example
13:05:21 <shapr> sounds nifty
13:05:34 <phubuh>  <<?IP_VERSION:4, HLen:4, SrvcType:8, TotLen:16, 
13:05:35 <phubuh>   ID:16, Flgs:3, FragOff:13, TTL:8, Proto:8, HdrChkSum:16,
13:05:35 <phubuh>   SrcIP:32, DestIP:32, RestDgram/binary>> = Packet
13:05:53 <phubuh> that deals with exactly what they're dealing with, so it's a good example :-)
13:05:56 <phubuh> http://www.erlang.org/doc/r7b/doc/extensions/bit_syntax.html#6
13:06:23 <Riastradh> V:N binds V to the respective N bits of Packet there?
13:06:37 <phubuh> yeah
13:06:50 <shapr> hm, nifty
13:07:08 <phubuh> ?IP_VERSION is a constant, so the match will fail if the version is wrong
13:07:51 <Riastradh> shapr, eh, FilePath is defined to be String.
13:07:53 <shapr> you could get the same sort of pattern matching by constructing a Haskell packet datatype
13:08:09 <Riastradh> Directory has no interesting bits.
13:08:09 <shapr> well, you could look at Java, but I think Java is even worse.
13:08:21 <shapr> Inferno maybe
13:08:29 <shapr> but that's a trick answer
13:08:38 <Riastradh> ?
13:09:14 <shapr> http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/licence.html
13:09:28 <shapr> has the OSDL said anything about Inferno's license?
13:09:53 <phubuh> I read the GFDL for the first time today, it really is quite ridiculous
13:10:11 <Riastradh> GFDL?
13:10:18 <shapr> I've heard that from some people, what's so crazy about the GFDL?
13:10:21 <phubuh> GNU Free Documentation License
13:10:39 <phubuh> shapr: for one, it has so called "invariant sections" that can only be modified by the copyright holder
13:10:42 <phubuh> and this clause:
13:10:44 <Riastradh> Any legalese from the FSF is of course going to be ridiculous.
13:10:49 <phubuh> You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.

13:10:50 <phubuh> u make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
13:11:04 <phubuh> emphasis on "You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute."
13:12:18 <phubuh> which seems to imply that it is impossible to, say, store a GFDL-licensed file on an encrypted partition.  or transfer it with an encrypted protocol.  or keep it with more restrictive permissions than a+r
13:12:19 <shapr> actually, since the DMCA, that's pretty sensible.
13:12:31 <shapr> hm, interesting point.
13:13:33 <shapr> I think I understand the spirit of the license, but you mention some obvious problems with the letter of the license
13:14:05 <phubuh> yes, overall, I agree with it.  but it has some nasty bits.

14:34:09 <phubuh> indeed
14:34:29 <nerdlor`> hey shapr
14:35:31 <shapr> anything exciting happening?
14:36:16 <nerdlor`> nothing in this neck of the woods -- too cold for excitement
14:36:47 <shapr> chilled bits, my favorite.
15:45:26 <shapr> YOW! I'm on FUNCTIONAL CAMERA!

15:57:53 <Riastradh> Old!
15:57:54 <Riastradh> @yow
15:57:55 <lambdabot> I guess you guys got BIG MUSCLES from doing too much STUDYING!
16:01:59 <shapr> gee, I could turn my SearchMailingList.hs code into a decent mailmain websearch program
16:02:18 <shapr> seems that's been specifically mentioned as a suck point of the haskell.org website.
16:02:43 <shapr> all I'd need is a clue about WASH and a decent persistent index.
16:03:35 <shapr> my TODO list approaches linux kernel sources in size
16:03:46 <shapr> (ok, only for linux 0.0.1)
16:04:13 <Riastradh> Maybe it would help to, um, _do_ some of that stuff.
16:04:21 <shapr> work keeps getting in the way
16:04:49 <shapr> I actually do knock stuff off of my list, but stuff always takes longer than I think it will.
16:05:34 <shapr> phubuh: you have an amusing .sig
16:05:47 * shapr goes back to work
16:06:02 <phubuh> I don't have a .sig, I just type some random stuff every time I send a mail :-)
16:06:06 <phubuh> (which isn't very often)
16:06:12 <shapr> send me an email!
16:06:14 <Riastradh> What was the last thing?
16:06:14 <shapr> I want one!
16:07:59 <phubuh> ok, I'm getting annoyed with evolution though, I'll do it once I configure Gnus :)
16:08:01 <phubuh> (which is now)
16:08:12 <Riastradh> shapr, what was his signature in the last email?
16:08:22 * phubuh doesn't remember
16:08:29 <Riastradh> That's why I was asking shapr.
16:08:44 <shapr> Hugs And Kisses
16:08:57 <Riastradh> ...that's it?
16:09:22 <shapr> it's also who he was responding to that made it amusing
16:09:32 <shapr> amusing quote from #plone:
16:09:36 <shapr> *** Guest558 (Guest558@AC921657.ipt.aol.com) has joined channel #plone
16:09:38 <shapr> <Guest558> HELLO IS PLONE LIKE FRONTPAGE OR ADOBE ,OR DREAMWEAVER
16:09:44 <phubuh> haha
16:10:06 <shapr> oh, it's getting better
16:10:15 <shapr> <Guest558> easy plone easy touseor do I need to gotoMIT 
16:10:21 <shapr> (using color codes of course)
16:10:30 <phubuh> oh boy
16:11:41 * shapr laughs hysterically
16:11:48 <shapr> I feel so sorry for this guy
16:13:04 <Riastradh> What now?
16:13:26 <shapr> <Guest558> want  to build a fewtravel sites and heard plone the best!!!
16:13:29 <shapr> <Guest558> what is the price
16:13:36 <shapr> <Guest558> howmany sites can you build with it
16:14:12 <Riastradh> Tell him there's a limit of three, unless you pay a $100 royalty to you first.
16:14:15 <shapr> <Guest558> is plone harder to learn than front page???anyone????
16:14:35 * shapr laughs much
16:14:54 <Riastradh> So, um, what is 'plone,' anyways?
16:15:13 <shapr> http://www.plone.org/
16:15:17 <shapr> it's what I do for a living.
16:15:40 <shapr> Hi Heffalump!!
16:15:43 <Heffalump> 'lo
16:15:46 <shapr> wassup?
16:15:48 <Heffalump> not much
16:15:52 <Heffalump> I should be going to bed.
16:15:55 <shapr> me too
16:15:57 <shapr> but I'm trying to work
16:15:58 <Riastradh> Why is there a bar near the top in Russian?
16:16:07 <shapr> Riastradh: they drink vodka there.
16:16:16 <shapr> oh, not that kind of bar.
16:16:26 <Riastradh> Hmm, there's a fair bit of Russian on the page.
16:18:06 <Riastradh> So why is there all that Russian text on the page?
16:18:33 <shapr> Riastradh: I don't see russian text, but it does change according to your requested language.
16:18:45 <Riastradh> Um, that's odd.
16:19:04 <Riastradh> I didn't request any language.  I just went to plone.org.
16:19:26 <Riastradh> And it's mostly in English...
16:19:32 <shapr> you can set the language your browser requests in the prefs
16:19:35 <Riastradh> ...just with a spattering of Russian here and there...
16:20:07 <Riastradh> I never configured my browser to request Russian or anything.
16:22:42 <Riastradh> That's rather queer.
16:23:35 <mattam> maybe it's some secret message they're giving to you.
16:23:50 <mattam> maybe not :)
16:23:51 <Riastradh> No, it's pretty mundane Russian.
16:40:28 <phubuh> ugh, I imported all my mail into gnus
16:40:33 <shapr> whee
16:40:38 * shapr cheers for gnus
16:40:43 <phubuh> gnus rocks
16:41:05 <phubuh> but how do I mark all of these as read? :-)
16:41:19 <shapr> MPAr will do it
16:41:21 <shapr> MPA is mark all
16:41:23 <shapr> and r is read
16:41:29 <phubuh> ah, right!
16:42:55 <phubuh> hmm, I don't think that worked
16:43:01 <phubuh> r replies for me
16:43:21 <shapr> ohh
16:43:22 <shapr> whoops
16:43:24 <shapr> sorry
16:43:34 <Riastradh> I bet a bunch of people just got a lot of blank emails accidentally.
16:43:45 <phubuh> hee hee
16:43:50 <phubuh> M C seems to have done the trick
16:43:55 <phubuh> M C
16:43:55 <phubuh>     Mark all unread articles as read (gnus-summary-catchup).
16:44:18 * Riastradh thinks he might go back to trying gnus.
16:44:57 <phubuh> actually, that didn't work.  when I q and enter the summary again, it wants to refetch everything, and when it does, everything's unread again
16:51:53 <det> Riastradh: I just started using it 2 weeks ago
16:52:05 <det> Riastradh: I really like it so far
16:52:12 <det> Riastradh: what are you using now ?
16:52:23 <Riastradh> Google Groups.  (See why I'm considering trying it out again?)
16:52:37 <det> oh .. I am using it for email as well
16:52:48 <Riastradh> Oh, I use Mail.app for email.
16:52:49 <Riastradh> (Well.
16:52:52 <Riastradh> I would.
16:53:00 <Riastradh> But my return key is being active and my mail server is dead.)
16:53:14 <det> phubuh: just hitting "c" marks the whole group as read for me
16:53:16 <Riastradh> Overactive, even.
16:53:23 <shapr> Riastradh: you know, I'll relay for you...
16:53:30 <phubuh> det: ah, yeah, it does
16:53:45 <Riastradh> shapr, no, that's OK, I've got an alternate email address, though it is designated for spam.
16:53:59 <shapr> ok
16:54:14 <phubuh> I figured out why my mail server was misbehaving
16:54:22 <shapr> anyone have suggestions for a good index structure for the haskell mailing lists?
16:54:26 <phubuh> my ISP is blocking all traffic on port 25 except for that which goes to their SMTP servers
16:54:32 <phubuh> :/
16:54:37 <Riastradh> That rather sucks.
16:54:43 <shapr> I've got the code to read all the mails, cut them into words, and create a FiniteMap from word to message
16:54:47 <det> shapr: index structure ?
16:54:48 <shapr> but it uses LOTS of ram
16:54:54 <phubuh> yeah.  it's no biggie though, they have a free SMTP server I can use.
16:55:02 <det> shapr: oh, haskell datastructure stuff
16:55:12 <shapr> det: got any good suggestions?
16:55:18 <phubuh> and I get 10 MBit/s up/down for like $30/month, so I'm not complaining :-)
16:55:21 <shapr> I haven't even checked the FM for strictness.
16:55:22 <Riastradh> I, however, still haven't found out why my mail server is misbehaving, and I probably never shall, as I'd have to delve into thousands of lines of C++, and I'd rather just write my own in Scheme.
16:55:35 <shapr> what mail server are you using?
16:55:39 <Riastradh> XMail.
16:55:43 <det> shapr: what is FiniteMap? btree of pairs ?
16:55:48 <Riastradh> No, I'd never heard of it before I started using it, either.
16:55:56 <shapr> det: from what I've heard, it's something like that.
16:56:03 <Riastradh> But it was simple to set up and it worked easily enough.  (or so it seemed)
16:56:16 <shapr> have you tried exim?
16:56:17 <det> Riastradh: what MTA are you using ?
16:56:22 <Riastradh> det, XMail.
16:56:22 <shapr> it's the easiest to setup, imho
16:56:26 <det> Riastradh: I've had good luck with exim4
16:56:27 <shapr> postfix is spiffier, but harder to setup.
16:56:33 <Riastradh> shapr, no, I haven't tried it.
16:56:34 <Igloo> IIRC it's a balanced-ish binary tree of pairs
16:56:40 <shapr> hi Igloo!
16:56:41 <det> shapr: exim4 seems nice
16:56:45 <Igloo> Hi Shae
16:56:47 <shapr> yes, exim is nice.
16:56:49 <Riastradh> shapr, why are you building a finite map?
16:57:00 <Riastradh> Why aren't you just dumping each association to a file when you find it?
16:57:03 <shapr> well, it was that or try to put it into my pockets.
16:57:06 <det> Riastradh: why the preference for XMail (never heard of it before)
16:57:07 <shapr> and I don't have that many pockets.
16:57:24 <Riastradh> det, it was very simple to set up and seemed to work well enough.
16:57:25 <shapr> Riastradh: I don't understand.
16:57:35 <det> Riastradh: debian ?
16:57:41 <Igloo> Ria: And what, read the file in and do a linear scan every time you want to look something up?
16:57:51 <shapr> Igloo: oh, do you know of something better?
16:58:10 <det> Igloo: maildir? ;)
16:58:15 <Riastradh> shapr, create a directory for the index.  For each email you find, dump a unique reference to it to index-dir/word.
16:58:22 <Riastradh> det, no, MkLinux.
16:58:32 <det> what is MkLinux ?
16:58:36 <det> oh, n/m
16:58:46 <det> was thinking you meant vs MailDir
16:58:47 <Riastradh> A [dead] Linux distribution based on RedHat and Mach.
16:58:48 <shapr> is Mk for 68k?
16:58:50 <det> not vs Debian
16:58:53 <shapr> oh
16:59:03 <Riastradh> Nope, it's running on a PPC.
16:59:11 <shapr> you could install another distro
16:59:13 <Riastradh> A NuBus PPC, specifically.
16:59:16 <shapr> oh, nifty
16:59:16 <det> Riastradh: Debian has a PPC port, yes ?
16:59:16 <Riastradh> I could, but I'm lazy.
16:59:23 <Riastradh> det, it might.  I dunno.
16:59:24 <det> Riastradh: what is your excuse ?
16:59:28 <Riastradh> I'm lazy!
16:59:36 <Igloo> I can't see an obvious way to have a significantly more efficient in-memory representation without compression. I'm no expert in the field, though...
16:59:36 <shapr> I haven't gotten my hands on a NuBus in years.
16:59:40 <det> install exim4
16:59:40 <Riastradh> I don't want to have to do more than I have to.  That's why I like[d] XMail.
16:59:48 <det> exim is very simple
16:59:53 <det> it's a primary goal
16:59:56 <shapr> Riastradh: or relay through ScannedInAvian
16:59:59 <shapr> :-P
17:00:00 <Riastradh> Nah, I'm writing my own mail server now.
17:00:06 * shapr snickers
17:00:14 <det> <Riastradh> I don't want to have to do more than I have to.  That's why I like[d] XMail.
17:00:17 <shapr> that's the sort of people I want to be on a channel with.
17:00:18 <det> <Riastradh> Nah, I'm writing my own mail server now.
17:00:35 * shapr sings the "I love to code" song
17:00:58 <Riastradh> det, I didn't like the others...they were all too flat.
17:01:01 <shapr> Igloo: I'd be happy with a decent on-disk representation
17:01:33 <shapr> I could use Riastradh's suggestion.
17:01:34 <phubuh> maybe you could just dump everything into postgres
17:01:40 <shapr> phubuh: I've strongly considered that
17:01:51 <shapr> but since I'm hoping for a permanent solution for haskell.org
17:01:54 <shapr> I don't know if they run postgres
17:02:14 <shapr> would be speedy though
17:02:27 <shapr> throw in each message as a TEXT, then index it.
17:02:40 <Riastradh> Igloo, what was your objection to my idea, by the way?
17:02:53 <shapr> on the other hand, if I wrote a  slow, inefficient, Haskell implementation
17:03:01 <Igloo> I wasn't sure what you meant
17:03:05 <shapr> then people could argue about it for weeks on the mailing lists.
17:03:08 <Igloo> Did you mean to do a linear scan for every lookup?
17:03:14 <shapr> and that would be more fun.
17:03:32 <Riastradh> Igloo, where a 'lookup' is...?
17:03:40 <Riastradh> Looking for all the emails that contain a certain word?
17:03:48 <Igloo> IO.hSeek seems to exist, so you ought to be able to do something efficient with indexes into the data and suchlike
17:03:48 <shapr> did you notice that someone created LibrariesExts because PreludeExts has become a monster?
17:03:50 <Riastradh> You'd just look at index-dir/word.
17:03:56 <det> Riastradh: exim4 is carbonated!
17:03:57 <Igloo> Yup
17:04:03 <Riastradh> det, ?
17:04:09 <Igloo> Oh, I thought you had a single file with all the data in
17:04:10 <det> it's not flat!
17:04:16 <Riastradh> det, oh.
17:04:30 <Riastradh> Igloo, no, of course not.  That would be incredibly dumb.  I'm not that dumb.
17:04:32 <shapr> at the moment, I have code to create a finitemap from a maildir
17:05:03 <shapr> what does mailman use as its gzip archive format?
17:05:07 <Igloo> You'd probably want index-dir/w/word, or an even deeper structure (at least in places), for ext2 at least
17:05:34 <Igloo> Ria  :-)
17:05:45 <Riastradh> Well, OK, fine, but nevertheless, I think it's a better idea than building up a finite map.
17:05:46 <Igloo> It was just "dumping each association to a file" made me think you meant a single file  :-)
17:06:32 <shapr> oh, it looks like the standard mail format
17:06:36 <shapr> the one they use in spool
17:06:40 <shapr> what's it called again?
17:06:41 <Riastradh> If you had a _lot_ of words, you might just end up using a file system trie.
17:07:06 <shapr> I've forgotten the name.
17:07:15 <Igloo> Grrr, it's tomorrow already and I haven't finished catching up with today yet
17:07:18 <shapr> haha
17:07:19 <shapr> me too!
17:07:28 <shapr> I have class soon enough
17:07:37 <Igloo> mbox
17:07:38 <Riastradh> No, it's not tomorrow; it's today.
17:07:58 <shapr> I have class in... seven hours.
17:08:05 <shapr> yes, mbox!
17:08:25 <phubuh> oh, bah, I need sleep
17:08:28 <shapr> me too
17:08:38 * phubuh has a swedish presentation and a spanish test tomorrow :/
17:08:46 <shapr> I have a swedish presentation too!
17:08:50 <phubuh> oh, nifty
17:08:50 <shapr> but mines on prepositions
17:08:52 <phubuh> what's yours about?
17:08:56 <shapr> what's yours about?
17:09:02 <phubuh> mine's about slang
17:09:10 <shapr> that sounds like fun.
17:09:17 <Riastradh> PreScheme is cooler.
17:09:18 <shapr> do you have an electronic copy?
17:09:28 <phubuh> I don't have an analog copy
17:09:34 <phubuh> nor an electronic copy
17:09:38 <shapr> ok, I'll try the index-dir/w/word structure, and see how it goes.
17:09:39 <Riastradh> Or did you mean the generic term 'slang,' not the language used to implement the Smalltalk VM?
17:09:40 <shapr> yow
17:09:41 <phubuh> I don't have any material at all, actually
17:09:52 <Riastradh> s/Smalltalk/Squeak/1
17:09:57 <shapr> well, time to write!
17:10:07 <phubuh> Riastradh: I'll probably have time to talk about that too
17:10:16 <shapr> I'm going to try to sleep, and hope for time to write this mailing list thingy tomorrow.
17:10:23 <phubuh> slang is swedish for hose, too, so I'll throw in something about those, too.
17:10:32 <shapr> hehe
17:12:18 * phubuh might have sent an e-mail to shapr
17:12:28 <Riastradh> You're not sure?
17:12:49 <phubuh> no, I might have sent it to some stranger -- I'm not sure what shapr's e-mail address is
17:13:01 <Riastradh> shapr@ScannedInAvian.org?
17:13:26 <phubuh> oh.  I sent it to shae@webwitches.com, I know he has an e-mail that's something with shae, web, and witches
17:13:43 <shapr> I guess you'll just have to see if you get a reply.
17:13:58 <phubuh> ok, good night!
17:14:05 <shapr> :-)
17:14:22 <phubuh> ooh, I did get it right!

18:54:15 <SamB> these people in #plan9 seem to have no respect for functional programming.
18:54:34 <SamB> or at least none for Haskell.
18:55:03 <cleverdra> so?  We have them in here, too.
18:56:23 <SamB> well, at least they don't get on my nerves as much.
18:56:35 <cleverdra> Why do the people in #plan9 get on your nerves?
19:08:56 <Riastradh> d2004xx, um, could you please either fix your connection, or disconnect until you've done so?
19:09:24 <d2004xx> It has no problem now
