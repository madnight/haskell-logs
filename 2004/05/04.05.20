04:52:20 <shapr> good morning #haskell!
04:53:19 <JaffaCake> morning, very quiet today
04:53:25 <Cale> morning
04:53:36 <shapr> shockingly quiet
04:53:56 <shapr> and haskell.org is down again
04:54:05 <Lunar^> urg
04:54:09 <Iter> shapr :)
04:54:14 <ibid> it the holy thursday, everybody's sleeping off their sleep debt :)
04:54:23 <Lunar^> Are they shutting down the server on each day off ?
04:54:26 <shapr> I should have ripped off that backup when I had the chance
04:54:35 <shapr> but I have a backup of the wiki!
04:54:44 <JaffaCake> the Yale guys are looking into it, AFAIK
04:54:48 <bringert> Lunar^: looks like it
04:55:19 <JaffaCake> and mirror.ac.uk is doomed :(
04:55:44 <shapr> why is it doomed?
04:55:58 <JaffaCake> going to be shut down in August, apparently
04:56:12 <shapr> I can host a mirror of haskell.org for small traffic uses
04:56:25 <JaffaCake> funding was removed, check the recent story on /.
04:56:41 <shapr> that sucks
04:56:44 <JaffaCake> yup
04:57:48 <Lunar^> JaffaCake: Do you remember the day ?
04:58:18 <JaffaCake> no, just search for mirror.ac.uk
04:58:52 <shapr> Si\: hey when will we see the next release of HAIFA?
04:59:14 * shapr sets up a hawiki mirror
05:00:01 <Lunar^> JaffaCake: When I look at /., that means I decided not to work for the next 2 hours, so I'm trying to avoid it :)
05:00:09 <Si\> hmmmm
05:00:24 <Jerub> Lunar^: I use alterslash.org
05:00:26 <shapr> yes, don't look at slashdot! it's worse than irc!
05:00:29 <Jerub> saves a HECK of a lot of time.
05:01:19 <Si\> I could produce a new release early next week, but still no Discovery Framework
05:01:44 <shapr> what's the discovery framework?
05:01:45 <Lunar^> http://www.mirror.ac.uk/help/funding_announcement.html
05:02:01 <Si\> and I haven't had time to fix up HWS-WP enough to give it access to HXT so I can't change HAC's protocol and the HWS-WP plugin is a mess anyway
05:02:54 <shapr> did you see don stewart's recent hs-plugin framework release?
05:04:03 <Si\> no where?
05:04:18 <shapr> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
05:04:39 <shapr> may not be helpful to you, but it's interesting
05:05:01 <Lunar^> shapr: This could be used for lambdabot 3.0 :)
05:05:27 <shapr> maybe
05:07:16 <shapr> I think he says it's limited to h98, but I don't understand why
05:07:29 <Si\> afaiks it's still only a single module loader
05:09:08 <shapr> "make generates a ``.dep'' file containing a list of package and objects that the source depends on. Subsequent calls to load will load these dependencies prior to loading the object itself. The te.dep file may be constructed manually by compiling the source with the ghcp tool."
05:10:19 <shapr> does that mean you could generate a bunch of modules and load the topmost?
05:10:28 <Si\> yes, but it isn't any sort of archive of modules, it just loads a number of single module files
05:10:45 <Si\> I dunno, I'll have to have a closer look
05:13:27 <shapr> Hampus Ram's loader http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/~d00ram/dynamic/ has dependencies also
05:14:57 <shapr> JaffaCake: any big changes planned for haddock 0.7 ?
05:21:59 <Igloo> JaffaCake: I know a couple of people who might be willing to do haskell.org mirrors in the UK if you're interested, although I guess you could probably have one at MSRC which might be simpler
05:27:00 <Maddas> Any good table tennis players here? :-)
05:30:47 <JaffaCake> shapr: re: Haddock 0.7, only one major feature planned so far
05:31:04 <JaffaCake> +/- buttons on the page for collapsing sections
05:31:09 <shapr> oh, neat
05:31:20 <JaffaCake> have it sorta working, but the buttons look ugly
05:31:31 <shapr> button ugly ;-)
05:31:35 <JaffaCake> lol
05:31:47 * shapr grins
05:32:12 <JaffaCake> any mirrors of haskell.org are welcome
05:32:17 <shapr> JaffaCake: too bad you didn't come to icfp03, would have been nice to meet you irl
05:32:34 <JaffaCake> you going to ICFP'04?
05:32:51 <shapr> don't think so
05:32:57 <JaffaCake> oh well :(
05:33:08 <shapr> not unless I can combine it with a trip to see my family
05:33:20 <JaffaCake> where's ur family?
05:33:26 <shapr> alabama
05:33:31 <JaffaCake> brb
05:33:32 <shapr> not very close to utah
05:35:01 <det> icfp is in Utah?
05:35:09 <shapr> I think so
05:35:10 <det> or does it rotate?
05:35:21 <shapr> oh, it was sweden last year
05:35:25 <shapr> it rotates
05:35:27 <det> I see
05:35:35 <det> I would go to it if it was in Utah :)
05:35:43 <Igloo> It alternates {somewhere in the US}, {somewhere not in the US (in Europe?)} I think
05:35:49 <Si\> so this plugin system uses GHC to compile the modules at runtime it seems
05:35:50 <det> that's a 5 hour car drive away
05:36:01 <shapr> http://www.cs.indiana.edu/icfp04/
05:36:16 <shapr> snowbird utah
05:36:59 <det> Never heard of it
05:38:12 <shapr> Si\: don's framework, yeah
05:38:34 <det> oh, ICFP contest is soon
05:40:05 <Si\> it seems to be more like a sort of dynamic programming framework than a plugin system
05:40:42 <kosmikus> JaffaCake: does haddock have a (La)TeX backend?
05:45:48 <det> nice.
05:45:50 <det> http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/icfpcontest/proclamation.html
05:46:00 <JaffaCake> kosmikus: not really, but there's the beginnings of a DocBook backend that can be used to generate TeX
05:46:18 <JaffaCake> it needs a lot of work to be complete, though
05:47:24 <kosmikus> ok ... is it difficult to write new backends?
05:48:01 <shapr> I think a lot of the code could be refactored around to make it easier
05:48:26 <kosmikus> I was thinking about doing something like haddock -> lhs2TeX -> TeX ...
05:48:37 <shapr> lambdabot's @index uses code from Main and HaddockHtml
05:48:42 <JaffaCake> probably... there are almost certainly bits of the HTML backend that could be reused in the DocBook backend
05:49:27 <shapr> the code is easy to get into though, nothing scary
05:49:34 <ustenzel> I'd like to see Haddock -> XML -> something else.  This way almost arbitrary XML could be embedded (think MathML).
05:49:54 <ozone> shapr: ooo, another dynamic loader
05:50:04 <ozone> will have to check that out when i get free time sometime next century
05:50:12 <shapr> ozone: which, hampus' or don's?
05:50:34 <ozone> hampus's
05:51:04 <shapr> his isn't a big chance from yours, but it does add deps and threadsafety
05:51:13 <JaffaCake> looks like the Americans have woken up and rebooted haskell.org
05:51:42 <shapr> since lambdabot already has deps manually done, I'm thinking of switching to hampus' code
05:52:31 <shapr> yay, haskell.org is back
05:53:05 <ozone> shapr: neat
05:53:55 <shapr> even so, I'd like to see all these flavors come together into something that would support hOp and Hemacs
05:59:48 <shapr> don's code gets typesafety by specifying the plugin type. Template Haskell could do it if there were some way to load an arbitrary .hs file with it.
06:01:49 <Si\> can't we just use the .hi files?
06:04:36 <shapr> foo, he left
06:06:24 <Igloo> Ouch, haskell.org is 14G
06:06:42 <JaffaCake> that's mainly old GHC distributions probably :)
06:07:03 <Igloo> ghc/dist/current is 4.5G, ghc/ is 9G total
06:07:18 <shapr> yah, 8.9gb in ghc/ and 2.4gb in antony/
06:07:24 <JaffaCake> I should implement some automatic cleaning for ghc/dist/current
06:07:41 <shapr> about 800mb for keith/
06:07:43 <Igloo> Is there a mirroring script that mirrors just the interesting bits? And if so, do you know how much space the mirror would use?
06:09:54 <shapr> Si\: I've never messed with .hi files, so I dunno
06:14:39 <shapr> Igloo: we could scrape one together?
07:12:36 <sorrow> What's wrong there?
07:12:38 <sorrow> f []     = []
07:12:38 <sorrow> f (x:xs) = do putStrLn(show x)
07:12:38 <sorrow>               f xs
07:13:28 <Igloo> What makes you think something is wrong?
07:13:40 <sorrow> the error message. ;-)
07:13:48 <Igloo> Which is?
07:14:10 <sorrow> ERROR "Test.hs":14 - Type error in final generator
07:14:45 <bringert> is that all it says?
07:14:45 <Igloo> Are you sure that's the right bit of code?
07:15:10 <Igloo> If you put the whole module on the web/paste page it might be useful
07:15:16 <sorrow> followed by "*** Term           : f xs\n*** Type           : [b]\n*** Does not match : IO a\n"
07:15:33 <bringert> that's the intersting part
07:15:50 <Igloo> What program is giving the error?
07:16:02 <bringert> the first line gives the function the return type [a]
07:16:11 <bringert> since it returns []
07:16:17 <Igloo> Aha, doh
07:17:02 <bringert> but the second case must be IO a
07:17:08 <bringert> since you use putStrLn
07:18:49 <sorrow> And what can I do about it?
07:19:12 <bringert> what do you want the function to return?
07:20:06 <sorrow> Nothing, actually. It's only purpose is to print all elements of a list.
07:21:27 <ustenzel> sorrow: think about the type of the function first.  what type will it get?
07:21:51 <bringert> since the function is in the IO monad, you need to use "return" in the base case. and () is a good thing to return when you don't want any results
07:22:21 <sorrow> ustenzel, a list of integers.
07:22:42 * bringert whispers "mapM_ print" and leaves
07:22:46 <ustenzel> sorrow: no.  a list of integers goes in.  what comes out?
07:23:53 <sorrow> ustenzel, nothing but the output on the screen.
07:25:35 <ustenzel> sorrow: nothing is noted () in haskell, if it causes output, its result is IO something.  this gives the type [Int] -> IO (), everything else follows from there.
07:30:51 <sorrow> Works now, thank you very much.
09:52:36 <neologism> hey guys, would you recommend me doing AI in haskell instead of lisp?
09:52:51 <neologism> given there is a lot of examples and other stuff in lisp
09:53:16 <Smerdyakov> Yes. Personally, I would use ML, though.
09:55:28 <neologism> I have choice just between haskell and lisp
09:55:41 <neologism> maybe prolog also but I'd prefer something functional
09:56:11 <Smerdyakov> Haskell wins, then!
09:56:47 <neologism> there is much more AI papers which present examples in lisp
09:57:28 <neologism> I'd better use haskell but the "easiness" of lisp in this is a strong argument
09:58:00 <Smerdyakov> I believe that writing correct programs in Lisp is much _harder_ than in Haskell.
09:58:20 <Smerdyakov> It's the same basic argument I'd use if you said that the "easyness" of assembly language prompted you to use it instead of C.
09:58:34 <neologism> I dont talk about programming
09:58:48 <neologism> but its easier to just take code cut'n'paste it and see what it does
09:58:58 <neologism> then rewriting it from lisp to haskell
09:59:21 <neologism> I'll think about it a bit more...
09:59:30 <Smerdyakov> And then, when you need to modify it, you have wasted time integrating it with your code _and_ understanding it, while, if you used Haskell, you'd have to do both at once from the start.
09:59:43 <neologism> hm... that sounds reasonable
09:59:53 <neologism> but - my ai professor is strongly lisp oriented
10:00:01 <neologism> but ok
10:00:09 <neologism> I'll try both and see ;)
10:18:31 <stepcut> morning shapr!
10:18:49 <iolotusbobo> hello shapr :)
10:18:57 <stepcut> @shapr
10:18:57 <lambdabot> needs sleep
10:21:06 <shapr> hiya
10:21:10 <shapr> what's going on?
10:21:40 <stepcut> not much
10:21:47 <stepcut> working on importing mozilla into arch
10:24:41 <stepcut> in the haskell world, I am working on some forum software (cuz, there aren't nearly enough forum packages out there)
10:26:21 <stepcut> but mine is different, see?
10:26:50 <shapr> sure, I see
10:26:57 <stepcut> :p
10:27:00 <bringert> stepcut: for yet another forum app, see the haskelldb homepage
10:27:20 <bringert> user/pwd: guest/guest
10:27:33 <stepcut> purrty
10:27:48 <stepcut> Unspecified action
10:27:48 <stepcut> Try again...
10:27:51 <stepcut> :p
10:27:58 <shapr> actually, I want to add commenting to PLog
10:28:47 <bringert> stepcut: did it say that?
10:28:53 <shapr> whoa, that's nifty
10:28:54 <stepcut> yes sir!
10:29:02 <stepcut> I hate that error :)
10:29:06 <shapr> and it's fast too
10:29:26 <stepcut> ah, its because I hit enter istead of pressing the button
10:29:30 <shapr> how do you add a topic?
10:30:12 <stepcut> you can make pressing enter, and clicking the button perform different actions, but by default, hit enter, does not have an action assigned
10:30:43 * shapr rips off the forum sourcecode
10:31:14 <stepcut> I am not actually writing a forum
10:31:15 <shapr> um, where's the copyright/license?
10:32:21 <stepcut> I am making a website engine where *everything* is referenced by an object_id, and you can create directed graphs of object_ids
10:32:23 <bringert> hmm, mardy, mary and torma wrote the forum
10:32:44 <bringert> I'm guessing they want a BSD license, but we never discussed that
10:32:58 <shapr> BSD sounds good to me
10:33:01 <stepcut> using that, you can attach messages, etc, to any object in the system. A forum is a subset of those capabilities
10:33:31 <shapr> the HaskellDB Forum source is easy to read
10:33:51 <bringert> mardy was talking about cleaning up the code, and I think they still have some race conditions to sort out
10:34:15 <shapr> I want to add it to my blog
10:34:42 <bringert> the db layout doesn't seem to be available
10:34:44 * shapr bounces happily
10:34:47 <shapr> oh
10:35:05 <shapr> a DBInfo layout would be particularly useful
10:35:15 <bringert> I might have it somewhere
10:36:14 <bringert> I'll just go to jackass and build one
10:36:21 <shapr> nice background
10:36:49 <bringert> torma is our resident designer
10:42:47 <bringert> shapr: I put a copy of the DBInfo at http://jackass.tekno.chalmers.se/dp03-7/DEMO/Forum.hs
10:45:01 <shapr> yay!
11:31:00 <shapr> hej spenatmannen 
11:31:04 <XTL> I'll just drop this here as well:  http://duma.orja.com/misc/torni_1302s.jpg
11:31:14 <spenatmannen> hej svejs
11:31:27 <XTL> To show the cube if nothing else :)
11:31:38 <shapr> XTL: bah, I'm jealous already
11:32:00 <shapr> spenatmannen: kommer du till EuroHaskell?
11:32:22 <spenatmannen> Vart hålls det?
11:32:30 <XTL> That's the stuff that's not in use.
11:32:34 <shapr> XTL: is that the cube your boss was dumping?
11:32:43 <shapr> oh, its still free?
11:32:47 <shapr> so um
11:33:04 <shapr> how can I bribe you to send it over thisavay?
11:33:21 <shapr> or did he decide to keep it?
11:33:33 <shapr> spenatmannen: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/EuroHaskell
11:33:40 <bringert> @eurohaskell
11:33:40 <lambdabot> less talks, more code!
11:33:40 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/EuroHaskell
11:33:40 <lambdabot> EuroHaskell - Haskell Hackfest - June 10-12 - Gothenburg, Sweden
11:34:11 <spenatmannen> hey! coolt.. jag bor i Göteborg...
11:34:34 <shapr> spenatmannen: I thought so, since you're using sgsnet.se
11:34:44 <shapr> do you go to chalmers?
11:35:08 <spenatmannen> there's no keeping secrets from you is there =)
11:35:23 <shapr> well, I don't know who you are :-)
11:35:48 <XTL> shapr: It is that, yes. And I got it here now.
11:35:48 <spenatmannen> no you don't :P
11:36:06 <XTL> I was just cleaning, so I piled those things and took a picture for some other people.
11:36:25 <shapr> XTL: so, you gonna hang onto it?
11:36:46 <XTL> I guess I could still give it up. It's more of an arrangement question. I'll keep it as safe as I can unless it gets another home.
11:37:10 <XTL> It would be nice to cut down on the amount of stuff to move. I am moving to Oulu this fall, it seems.
11:37:23 <shapr> if you want to hang onto it, I understand. It's worth serious geek points to own one.
11:37:27 <shapr> ah, really?
11:37:50 <shapr> spenatmannen: so, are you learning haskell?
11:37:50 <bringert> spenatmannen: I know who you are
11:38:14 <bringert> learn to fear ypcat
11:38:48 <spenatmannen> sharp: yes I am... I'm doing this cgi-thingie... 
11:39:04 <shapr> what sort of CGI thingie?
11:39:11 <shapr> I've done some CGI in haskell
11:39:31 * shapr discovers who spenatmannen is
11:41:00 <bringert> and I have been a teaching assistant in the class you are doing the lab for :)
11:41:32 <spenatmannen> It's a dictionary... it's not quite finish... 
11:41:42 <XTL> Hmm.. some school teaches/uses Haskell?
11:42:01 <bringert> XTL: yes, Chalmers in Gothenburg
11:42:14 <bringert> other's do that too
11:42:19 <spenatmannen> Björn? e d du?
11:42:19 <shapr> XTL: I think I can get someone to pick up the NeXT if you want to get rid of it.
11:42:25 <XTL> Neat.
11:42:39 <bringert> ja
11:42:48 <spenatmannen> eek
11:42:53 <shapr> XTL: so, what do you think?
11:42:53 <bringert> ?
11:43:06 * spenatmannen fruktar lärare av alla slag
11:43:13 <XTL> shapr: how would that happen?
11:43:19 <bringert> spenatmannen: lets take it in #haskell.se
11:44:04 <stepcut> du alla slag kommer vart det?
11:44:10 <shapr> XTL: you have a moment to come to #webwitches?
11:44:42 <XTL> Sure.
11:45:16 <bringert> stepcut: ?
11:45:24 <stepcut> :p
11:45:47 * stepcut has no idea what he is saying
11:45:55 <stepcut> something about coming
11:46:32 <spenatmannen> it really made no sence...
11:46:48 <stepcut> i bet !
11:47:00 <bringert> "you all kinds come where that?"
11:47:01 <spenatmannen> you said : you every kind comes where it?
11:47:10 <bringert> :)
11:47:13 <spenatmannen> he!
11:47:24 <stepcut> I only know english and a little japanese so far :)
11:47:36 <stepcut> and haskell
11:47:42 <shapr> ha
11:47:54 <bringert> how do you order a beer in haskell?
11:48:21 <stepcut> repeat Beer
11:48:21 <shapr> unsafePerformImbibe
11:48:23 <shapr> ?
11:48:39 <bringert> btw, don't ask andersca how to have lunch in a monad
11:48:59 <andersca> :)
11:49:12 <bringert> stepcut: that probably won't end well
11:49:20 <stepcut> :p
11:49:28 <stepcut> replicate 4 Beer ?
11:50:05 <spenatmannen> map giveBeer [users]
11:50:18 <bringert> stepcut: otoh, it's lazy, so you won't get the next beer until you finish the first one
11:50:29 <stepcut> bringert: yep!
11:51:58 <stepcut> bringert: you can always do:  takeUntil drunk $ repeat Beer  :p
11:52:17 <stepcut> but drunk would probably have to perform some unsafe IO
11:52:23 <bringert> haha
11:52:52 <bringert> unsafe for innocent bystanders?
11:55:02 <andersca> byst-anders
11:56:49 * bringert sighs
11:57:38 <bringert> andersca: how about a beer after our presentations tomorrow to get the bad jokes out of our systems?
11:57:51 <andersca> you mean at 10? :)
11:57:57 <bringert> exactly
11:58:15 <andersca> sure, maybe john wants one too
11:58:20 <bringert> then we can sit around asking silly questions all day
11:58:29 <andersca> hmm, I was this --> <-- close typing "Maybe John"
11:59:43 <andersca> polli: maybe you want to join us too?
12:00:27 <polli> andersca: maybe
12:00:42 <polli> andersca: need to see how much sleep I get tonight :)
12:00:53 <andersca> I won't get much sleep, that's for sure
12:01:01 <andersca> especially not with this parsec problem :/
12:04:48 <bringert> andersca: you seem to suffer from the delusion that your project has to work before you can present it
12:05:16 <andersca> bringert: otherwise I'll never finish i
12:05:16 <andersca> t
12:05:34 <andersca> ;)
12:05:59 <vegai> if it works when you present it, you automatically stand out of other projects ;P
12:06:56 <andersca> also, I need to get the last few design details straightened out
12:42:22 * shapr boings
13:37:55 * Maddas moves the trampoline while shapr is in the air
13:38:12 <shapr> aieee
13:38:35 <Maddas> It only makes you stronger!
13:39:02 <shapr> there is now a darcs wiki: http://www.ScannedInAvian.org/DarcsWiki/
13:39:30 * Maddas snickers and takes shapr's Kinesis Ergo keyboard with while leaving
13:40:28 <iolotusbobo> 'ullo shapr
13:40:34 <shapr> hi iolotusbobo 
13:40:45 <iolotusbobo> howdy shapr
13:40:49 <shapr> Maddas: I'm not using my kinesis at the moment
13:40:49 <Maddas> Oh, did the contest ever happen?
13:40:57 <shapr> which contest?
13:40:59 <Maddas> shapr: Excellent, so you won't even miss it.
13:41:14 <shapr> you can have the broken one :-P
13:41:18 <Maddas> The Haskell versus C++ shoot-out between you and iolotusbobo :-)
13:41:24 <Maddas> Oh, is that why you're not using it?
13:41:28 * shapr keeps meaning to send it off for repair
13:41:32 <iolotusbobo> heh Maddas 
13:41:33 <shapr> no, I have two
13:41:39 <Maddas> Haha
13:41:44 <Maddas> Ok, so why don't you use the other one?
13:42:21 <shapr> because my left hand started hurting tremendously, so I've switched to dvorak right-hand layout
13:42:36 <shapr> my left hand is much better now, happily
13:43:02 <shapr> and I can touchtype a new layout too
13:43:20 <Maddas> Heh.
13:43:25 <Maddas> Why did the left hand hurt?
13:43:53 <Maddas> (ouch, by the way)
13:43:54 <shapr> I'm not sure, I thought RSI at first, but I dunno if RSI would go away in a few weeks
13:44:16 <Maddas> I'd think that if it's from typing, the right hand would hurt first
13:44:23 <shapr> why?
13:44:30 <Maddas> especially since you probably use the mouse with the right hand too
13:44:36 <shapr> nah, lefty
13:44:40 <Maddas> oh, ok
13:45:13 <Maddas> Judging only from the things I typed in the last one minute or so, the right hand is used more in Dvorak than the left
13:45:29 <Maddas> Although that probably is neither representative nor accurate :-)
13:45:44 <Maddas> s/(probably) (is)/$2 $1/
13:47:08 <shapr> I've read some comparisons, but I don't remember the results
13:47:49 <Maddas> ok :-)
13:51:39 <Maddas> Looks like whoever said that was right, emacs is very slowly but certainly taking over.
13:58:25 <shapr> ?
14:05:34 <Maddas> my activities
14:05:40 <Maddas> Maybe I'll soon use ERC myself :-)
14:05:51 <shapr> it's pretty spiffy
14:06:12 <shapr> I wrote a tiny part of ERC long ago
14:06:22 <Maddas> Cool
14:06:46 <Maddas> I'm still not much past 'cut-and-paste elisp from various websites' ;-)
14:07:00 <Maddas> (Mostly due to lack of ideas)
14:25:31 <shapr> you could hack on haskell-mode :-)
14:29:04 <Maddas> shapr: heh. 
14:29:27 <Maddas> I think I'll stick to checking out the mandatory emacs modes first, ibuffer and iswitch-buffer for today :-)
14:30:51 <shapr> you wanna see my .emacs?
14:31:19 <andersca> that is a very personal question
14:31:22 <shapr> it's around 1400 lines last I looked
14:31:22 <Maddas> haha
14:31:27 <Maddas> shapr: Cool, sure.
14:31:35 <Maddas> Mine isn't very interesting at all
14:31:51 <Maddas> (And only 102 lines long)
14:32:06 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/src/elisp/
14:32:24 <shapr> I had to cut mine into separate files
14:34:39 <bringert> you run xmms from emacs?
14:35:14 <shapr> yup
14:35:24 <shapr> Logan wrote xmms-shell
14:35:40 <shapr> he did the hard work
14:35:42 <bringert> what don't you do in emacs?
14:35:57 <shapr> well, emacs is single threaded
14:36:02 <shapr> and that sucks very much
14:36:09 <Maddas> bringert: Something like that is what I meant with emacs taking over here too :-)
14:36:25 <shapr> and elisp is a crappy language
14:36:37 <shapr> it was great when it was first written
14:36:47 <shapr> but that's been a looooong time
14:37:04 <XTL> The world clearly needs a new emacs with more features, multitas^H^Hhreading and a better language.
14:37:14 * bringert uses emacs as a text editor
14:37:28 * mattam too
14:37:30 <shapr> emacs uses regexps for syntax hightlighting and parsing, which also sucks
14:37:32 * bringert does not use it to wash his clothes
14:37:44 * XTL uses emacs only if someone manages to talk him into making some elisp for them
14:37:46 <Maddas> bringert: So do I, but there's still a lot of things I can improve.
14:38:11 <shapr> the semantic bovinator is a full elisp lexer/parser generator, and it's an improvement, but...
14:38:41 <Maddas> You really want monadic parser combinators, don't you?
14:38:46 <shapr> in fact, text macros are pretty stupid when dealing with source code
14:38:51 <Maddas> (I just love that name ofr sounding so complicated)
14:38:53 <shapr> Maddas: arrows
14:38:53 <Maddas> s/ofr/for/
14:39:19 <shapr> something like the MetaEnvironment is a much better approach
14:40:01 <shapr> it uses ASF+SDF and Stratego to give you language agnostic parse tree rewriting
14:40:31 <shapr> so instead of writing text macros, you could write parse tree macros
14:40:44 <bringert> I like this phrase from out haskelldb report: "a phantom typed relational algebra-like monadic embedded domain specific language"
14:40:57 <bringert> s/out/our/
14:41:06 <shapr> wow, that's nice
14:41:29 <bringert> it's there to keep trespassers out
14:41:37 <andersca> bringert: I read the report
14:41:39 * shapr snickers
14:42:16 <bringert> andersca: did forester give you any beer yet?
14:42:23 <andersca> no :(
14:42:29 <andersca> and I had to make the coffee myself
14:42:34 <Maddas> shapr: Heh.
14:43:10 <Maddas> shapr: I have no idea what exactly that means, so I'll just let writing the next emacs up to you and then be impressed. :-)
14:44:57 <shapr> well, you know parse trees aka abstract syntax trees, right?
14:46:33 <Maddas> Vaguely
14:46:39 <Maddas> But I get the idea, sure
14:46:40 <Jerub> I never got ASF+SDF working
14:46:41 <shapr> thing is, language syntax often differs, but the underlying structure is the same
14:46:58 <Jerub> but the dynamic semantics of the underlying structure often differs too...
14:47:37 <XTL> shapr: You're saying that the editor should in fact parse the source or did I miss something?
14:47:55 <XTL> Well, up to a tree or such that it can use
14:48:11 <shapr> I'm saying it should also let you access the parse tree
14:48:36 <Jerub> XTL: yes!
14:48:40 <Jerub> all editors should do this imho.
14:49:14 <XTL> That could well be.
14:49:24 <shapr> refactoring browsers are just tree regex matchers and tree transformers
14:49:32 <Jerub> at the moment many editors do lexical highlighting.
14:49:35 <XTL> At least they could be more informed than they are now.
14:50:09 <Jerub> I've always wanted to have an editor window that showed the tree-form of my program behind it using transparency.
14:50:18 <Jerub> :))
14:51:01 <shapr> if you've ever written a text macro to do some tedious source fixing, think how it could be better to have the AST available
14:51:31 <shapr> python2.2 (or nearby) added +=
14:52:20 <shapr> so you could write a macro that would look for var = var + 1 and replace it with var += 1
14:53:12 <shapr> or var = var op constant -> var +op constant
14:54:50 <shapr> so, if you can map the source to the tree and back, syntax highlighting is easier (mostly)
14:55:02 <shapr> so is 'spell checking'
14:55:19 <shapr> I could go on about this at great length :-)
14:55:45 <XTL> And if you edit, more or less, at the tree level...
14:56:20 <shapr> then a common subexpression macro is easy
14:56:54 <shapr> or a deforestation macro that removes temporary intermediate lists
14:57:19 <XTL> I wonder why people aren't doing this. Old editors are too hard to change and the new ones are too specialized?
14:58:07 <shapr> humans fear change?
14:58:14 * Maddas grins at shapr's Hyper key
14:58:41 <shapr> :-)
14:58:42 <XTL> Hard to imagine programmers or hackers fearing something useful.
14:58:49 <XTL> Hyper key? Where?
14:59:15 <Jerub> I have Super and Hyper too now ;)
14:59:17 <Maddas> http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/src/elisp/shae-keybindings.el
14:59:24 <Maddas> Although that might not be the answer you hoped for :-)
14:59:34 <XTL> Ah, there.  Just the answer, thank you :)
14:59:56 <XTL> I try to avoid messing with keymaps. Done enough of that.
15:00:22 <XTL> At work I got the win keys to control ion and that menu key do compose. That was neat.
15:00:23 <shapr> XTL: have you ever tried to persuade someone to try a different editor?
15:00:29 <Maddas> I have customized my default Viper editing keys to match my former customized vim keys
15:00:48 <Maddas> (Basically just making it more Dvorak-friendly)
15:00:54 <shapr> anyway, I want Hemacs
15:01:14 <XTL> shapr: Sure. At least I got everyone at work to learn vim by strategic upgrades even if they code with emacs ;)
15:01:31 <XTL> shapr: But that could be. That was sort of the second option about too specialized.
15:02:04 <XTL> By that I meant throwing away useful and habitual things as baggage and cramming in all novel features they can manage.
15:02:16 <XTL> I imagine people writing all those IDE's do that.
15:02:17 <Maddas> I'd switch editors fairly quickly if I see the alternative being significantly better
15:02:35 <shapr> I tried to persuade a bunch of people on #emacs that we should refactor all the internal modules and change all the function names to something sensible
15:02:59 <shapr> something like all verb-noun or all noun-verb
15:03:35 <shapr> code and functionality duplication inside emacs is large
15:03:47 <Maddas> Wouldn't massive script breakage occur that way?
15:03:50 <shapr> yup
15:04:03 <Maddas> I guess that's the drawback, then
15:04:23 <shapr> even the people who agreed with me said "do YOU want to rewrite gnus?"
15:04:52 <XTL> Adding a massive load of aliases and hoping people use the sane ones might not be the smartest thing either.
15:04:57 <Maddas> So write an editor that can parse the AST and refactor emacs with it!
15:05:01 <Maddas> s/AST/AST of elisp/
15:05:16 <Maddas> Although on the other hand, if you already wrote that editor you might not need emacs anymore :-)
15:05:22 <shapr> yup
15:06:17 <shapr> as soon as I find a way to do typesafe runtime code re/loading in Haskell, it's time to start Hemacs
15:06:20 <XTL> Well, if you extended emacs to do that then you could show the awesome power by doing that massive renaming :)
15:06:50 <shapr> well, there's a 'problem' with refactoring
15:07:21 <shapr> you can't do it right unless there are unit tests to check your result
15:08:04 <shapr> because, refactoring does not change meaning, but it often does change 'functionality'
15:08:22 <shapr> it's like extensional vs intensional equality
15:09:14 <shapr> bubble sort and quick sort are equal in one sense, and unequal in another
15:10:07 <shapr> so, this meaning they always talk about in refactoring is really whatever your specification is
15:10:45 <XTL> I should be sleeping..
15:10:48 <shapr> I've never seen any unit tests for emacs
15:11:03 <shapr> hyvÃ¤Ã¤ ihltaa
15:11:32 <shapr> anyway, QuickCheck is better
15:33:50 <heroist> anyone good at genetic programming and monadic parser combinators?
15:35:03 <heroist> I'd want to build a convergent series of parsers
15:35:27 <heroist> or rather generate
15:36:03 <shapr> I've used monadic parser combinators
15:36:31 <heroist> good they are closed under composition right?
15:36:32 <shapr> haven't done anything with genetic programming though
15:36:44 <shapr> closed?
15:36:53 <heroist> anyone genetic programming experience?
15:37:04 * heroist back in 10 minutes
15:53:39 <heroist> shapr: do the parser combinators yield a tree structure?
15:54:40 <shapr> well, not unless it's an ambiguous grammar
15:55:29 <heroist> genetic programming is an optimization technique which forms new programs by repositioning nodes in a (functional) program tree
15:55:56 <heroist> I want to use it to construct a parser for an unknown language
15:56:35 <heroist> that is, the target language is known, but the domain is arbitrary
15:56:58 <heroist> it works on a sillable level
15:57:06 <heroist> only on words
15:57:44 <heroist> so the grmmar can be sort of ambiguous
15:57:59 <heroist> it's supposed to be a many one mapping
15:58:53 <shapr> sounds nice
15:59:33 <heroist> shapr: do you think such a technique can be used to form a parser by recombining monadic parser combinators?
15:59:38 <shapr> you could use the list monad for backtracking
15:59:52 <shapr> sure, but it'll take awhile
16:00:11 <shapr> probably be faster to write it yourself
16:00:41 <heroist> what is the 'unit' for a parser combinator? 
16:00:42 <shapr> how do you define a partial match?
16:01:09 <shapr> maybe something that matches the empty string?
16:02:02 <heroist> a match can be defined as matching part of a word in the target language
16:03:08 <heroist> so welcome= wel-come if it matches wel it is a match
16:04:14 <shapr> yes, I think that will work, but I don't know enough to say how useful it would be
16:04:21 <heroist> but the object language has more units as the target language, so a pattern like 123456 has six units, but it could be it has to be mapped to wel.
16:04:53 <heroist> and then again 1829374056 could be mapped to wel-come
16:05:18 <heroist> so that is a convoluted input
16:05:26 <shapr> I don't know anything about genetic programming, sorry
16:07:19 <heroist> think of it as a search for the right combination of unit parser combinators
16:07:42 <heroist> what can one monadic parser combinator do?
16:07:56 <heroist> what is it's structure?
16:08:30 <shapr> you should look at the parsec tutorial
16:09:01 <heroist> is it like a regular expression? (I will look at it)
16:09:34 <shapr> er, not really
16:09:39 <shapr> kind of
16:09:52 <shapr> some yes, some no
16:10:11 <shapr> you know how to do backreferences in regexes?
16:10:43 <shapr> if so, think of backrefs to the pattern, not the match
16:11:08 <Olathe> It's \1 for the first capture or something like that.
16:11:50 <shapr> right, but think of \1 being the pattern, not the capture
16:12:16 <shapr> but that's just parsers in general, not monadic parser combinators specifically
16:14:01 <heroist> aha
16:14:38 <heroist> I'm looking here: http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/download/parsec/parsec.html
16:14:47 <heroist> my university :)
16:16:13 <shapr> spiffy
16:16:25 <Jerub> yay!
16:16:27 <Jerub> parsec rocks.
16:18:56 <heroist> can I compile haskell to c or somethng, to call it from c++?
16:19:23 <shapr> you can call it from C++
16:19:53 <shapr> but it's not the most straightforward thing to do
16:20:06 * heroist is probably never going to write parsers in c++ nomore
16:20:19 <heroist> no?
16:20:28 <shapr> it' easier to call the other way
16:21:16 <heroist> I'll have to use it as a module in an adaptive system (neural networks etc)
16:21:31 <heroist> so I don't think I can do it the other way around
16:23:15 <Cale> doesn't the ffi have export declarations?
16:23:25 <heroist> can haskell programs be compiled as stand alone object files, to be linked with g++?
16:23:52 <heroist> so can they exist without the haskell interpreter?
16:24:00 <Cale> yeah
16:24:07 <Cale> compile them with ghc
16:24:22 <Cale> in fact, use ghci for interpreting :)
16:25:04 <Cale> foreign export ccall "addInt" (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
16:26:57 <shapr> hm, I thought it was more trouble than that
16:28:19 <reffie> mm
16:28:24 <Cale> well, let's hope it's trivial from the other side, as that seems to be all that can be done from the haskell side.
16:29:15 <heroist> ?
16:29:18 <reffie> what should i use, if i want to have a collection of pairs, and i want to be able to search this collection based on the first element of the pair?
16:29:34 <heroist> can you elaborate on your last remark?
16:30:06 <reffie> something like a hash table, maybe..
16:30:28 <heroist> the other side?
16:30:39 <Cale> heroist: i.e. the calling side
16:30:58 <Cale> reffie: perhaps a FiniteMap?
16:31:03 <heroist> yeah but what has to be trivial?
16:31:10 <Cale> the import
16:31:17 <Cale> and using the call
16:31:22 <reffie> Cale thanks, i'll look into it
16:31:25 <heroist> aha
16:31:36 <heroist> type matching and such
16:32:42 <Cale> yeah - matching the data up to be in the same format and so on. Haskell's FFI has been good to me so far, so I'd expect that everything should go smoothly, but I've never exported calls.
17:12:14 <bringert> I seem to rememeber that not all types of function exports are implemented
18:11:19 <reffie> is there an empty IO action?
18:15:11 <Riastradh> return ()
18:15:35 <reffie> thanks
