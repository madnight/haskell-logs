02:55:15 <bourbaki> hi
03:46:34 <shapr> y0
03:53:26 <shapr> wassup?
05:02:42 <bringert> hi shapr
05:03:03 <shapr> hej bringert 
05:03:05 <shapr> wassup?
05:03:19 <bringert> hacking on a GF parser in java
05:03:40 <bringert> "man bites dog" -> SimpleS (TransVP Bites (NounNP Dog)) (NounNP Man)
05:03:48 <bringert> is where I'm at now
05:04:11 <bringert> it's going to go in the applet I showed you
05:04:31 <shapr> sounds like fun
05:04:59 <bringert> discussed having a public GF source code repo with aarne, he liked the idea
05:05:13 <bringert> not sure how to do it though
05:05:16 <shapr> yay, public 0-day warez :-)
05:05:36 <bringert> anonymous CVS access requires some admin and can have security problems, afaiu
05:05:41 <shapr> yup
05:05:56 <bringert> darcs is nice, but the current repo is CVS
05:06:14 <bringert> another alternative is nightly snapshots, but then it's hard to just get the changes
05:07:00 <shapr> you could do nighty tarballs, or slurp from cvs into a darcs repo
05:07:00 <shapr> a separate anon cvs is a lot of trouble
05:07:35 <shapr> that's true
05:07:48 <shapr> there's a neat tool written in Python that slurps changes from cvs into darcs
05:07:54 <shapr> but that may be too much trouble to setup
05:07:59 <shapr> I haven't set it up myself.
05:08:13 <shapr> I think lelit wrote it....
05:09:00 <lelit> that's me :)
05:09:47 <lelit> bringert: I use it daily now, to import "Plone" various parts into several darcs repos
05:28:52 <bringert> lelit: is it hard to set up?
05:29:15 <lelit> no, given python on board :)
05:29:39 <bringert> got a url?
05:30:32 <lelit> The darcs repos is at http://nautilus.homeip.net/~lele/projects/cvsync/ Beware, the actual tool is "tailor.py"
05:31:14 <lelit> see also http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/ConvertingFromSubversion
05:31:22 <lelit> for practical examples
05:48:11 <shapr> how do I get vim to start up with :syntax enable ?
05:48:11 * shapr used to know this sort of thing
05:51:26 <thebug> ':syntax on' I thought ...
05:52:12 <thebug> or just have 'syntax on' in ~/.vimrc :)
05:54:35 * shapr turns his MTA policy up to 'vicious'
05:55:35 * thebug hands shapr a sign to put up -> "Beware of MTA"
05:55:51 <thebug> woof
05:58:40 * shapr grins
05:58:59 <shapr> g'day SyntaxNinja 
06:03:14 <SyntaxNinja> hihi shapr
06:15:46 <goron> Is the server of gnu.org on 56K? It's damn slow. 
06:16:08 <shapr> they recently upgraded to a 28.8 modem
06:16:21 <shapr> their 2400baud modem finally burned out
06:16:33 <shapr> I still have my 1200 baud modem around here somewhere, I could loan it to them.
06:16:48 <goron> you do that :)
06:16:55 <SyntaxNinja> what a strange day it is when a linux company has to reverse-engineer a software program so linux users can _buy music_ from apple.
06:17:07 <SyntaxNinja> I mean... don't they want us to buy music?
06:17:20 * shapr trained his speed reading skills by reading text files at 1200 baud
06:17:29 <goron> That was a couple of days ago...
06:18:27 * shapr is 503
06:21:18 * shapr fights with mailman
06:23:14 * goron is reading evil (?) autoconf documentation to cope with the real world...
06:23:27 * shapr fakes out the DNS cache on his ISP
06:24:34 * shapr stabs his ISP
06:26:05 <shapr> yay, the finally got it.
06:27:05 <goron> Pinging takes 108 ms... damn slow...
06:27:38 <shapr> I wonder if citeseer has a new submissions page.
06:29:30 <goron> Are there Haskell autoconf macro's?
06:29:38 <shapr> there's CABAL
06:29:52 <shapr> you can reuse the stuff from the fptools tree probably.
06:30:27 <goron> shapr: You just told me something new :)
06:30:40 <shapr> I am a repository of new information.
06:30:42 <bringert> goron: I wrote some for haskelldb. what specifically are you looking for?
06:30:58 <shapr> that's at least partially because much of my information is made up on the spot.
06:31:15 <SyntaxNinja> cabal should definitely facilitate the collection of One True Autoconf for Haskell.
06:32:34 <goron> bringert: nothing in particular, but I just would like to browse through a lot of them and see how they work. 
06:33:11 <goron> shapr: can I also do a SELECT on you :-)
06:33:23 <shapr> yes, but you never know what you'll get back
06:33:45 * shapr realizes he's broken his MTA
06:34:21 <goron> They updated it two days ago :)
06:34:32 <shapr> my MTA?
06:35:16 * shapr fixes
06:35:41 <goron> What's MTA? I don't think you mean the second hit on google
06:36:05 <SyntaxNinja> genSym is mean to give me a previously unknown symbol, right? one that's guaranteed not to clash with another symbol?
06:36:12 <SyntaxNinja> mta= Mail Transfer Agent or something
06:36:24 <goron> ok
06:36:29 <SyntaxNinja> usually used in the phrase, "My MTA is broken" or "Your MTA is broken"
06:37:57 <SyntaxNinja> or "no it's not, YOUR MTA is broken!"
06:37:59 <goron> Great page:
06:38:01 <goron> Peter Packager builds operating system specific install files (e.g. .msi .rpm .deb) from packages supplied by Marcus or Angela. We might also call him Roland RPM, Donald Debian, and Willie Windows who build Linux RPM, Debian, and Windows installer packages respectively
06:38:14 <shapr> I know the guy who wrote that!
06:38:20 <SyntaxNinja> you have Simon PJ to thank for that one, actually :)
06:38:40 <goron> He also got great slides: "warm fuzzy thing"....
06:38:56 <SyntaxNinja> someone had suggested, "Isaac Installer" but I rejected it, mostly because I know this really pretty girl named Isabella who deserves to have a persona named after her.
06:39:10 * shapr grins
06:39:47 <SyntaxNinja> so who wants to be on the Cabal Autoconf team?
06:40:21 * shapr runs away
06:45:09 <goron> are people using Cabal? Or isn't there a bit code written yet?
06:46:08 <SyntaxNinja> it was just released the other day, there are examples linked from the main page.
06:46:18 <SyntaxNinja> but it's a pre-release!
06:46:27 <shapr> it's usable
06:46:33 <shapr> there's a lot of good code in Cabal
06:47:06 <SyntaxNinja> goron: what are you packaging, ooi?
06:48:27 <goron> I want to know whether somebody else already packages something.
06:48:37 <goron> I want to know whether somebody else already had packages something.
06:48:57 <shapr> I packaged QuickCheckM
06:49:02 <shapr> HUnit has been packaged
06:49:09 <SyntaxNinja> WASH :)
06:49:15 <SyntaxNinja> Cabal is packaged in Cabal
06:49:18 <shapr> WASH is big medicine
06:49:32 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: I didn't know you packaged QuickCheckM? Can I add it to the examples?
06:49:40 <shapr> sure, it's around here somewhere.
06:49:45 <shapr> it's just a clone of HUnit
06:49:46 <SyntaxNinja> or better yet, would you send me a patch so I can just apply it :)
06:50:00 <Igloo> What do you want autoconf for?
06:50:12 <Igloo> You might be able to steal what you want from things like darcs
06:50:13 <shapr> sure, after I've setup this mailing list, fixed the wiki, and announce the IOHCC
06:51:20 <SyntaxNinja> 4th on the TODO list isn't too shabby :)
06:51:32 * shapr grins
06:51:54 <goron> SyntaxNinja: are you a developer on that project?
06:51:57 <shapr> I have an infinite TODO list.
06:53:36 <SyntaxNinja> goron: not on darcs, but on Cabal
06:55:14 <goron> SyntaxNinja: That's what I was referring to. So you are busy with your PhD?
06:55:41 <SyntaxNinja> goron: nope; I work in industry
06:56:22 <goron> SyntaxNinja, so you are helping for free... Great :-)
06:56:23 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: should be OK unless you try to write it all down
06:57:22 <shapr> heh
07:08:31 <shapr> lambdabot: @quit
07:23:08 <shapr> finally, I have a mailing list!
07:25:59 <LemmihLaptop> lifeOfShapr@haskell.org?
07:26:21 <shapr> er, no... iohcc@lists.ScannedInAvian.org
07:26:25 <goron> I thought his life was already on IRC....
07:26:35 <shapr> goron: dude, I have a life.
07:26:47 <LemmihLaptop> goron, He could run a double life (-:
07:26:54 <shapr> I enjoy IRC, but it's not all there is to life.
07:27:23 <goron> I hate IRC. It means that someone fucked up something and I need to ask how to fix it. 
07:27:46 <shapr> I enjoy IRC, it means I get to talk to smart people, learn new things, and find more mental toys.
07:28:15 <goron> Well, that too. But there aren't that much channels with such people...
07:28:26 <shapr> so make channels like that!
07:33:55 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: around for a TH question?
07:34:03 <Igloo> Yes
07:34:16 <SyntaxNinja> so in module B I have fooTest s1 = varE s1
07:34:32 <SyntaxNinja> in module A I have:
07:34:33 <SyntaxNinja> x = 3
07:34:33 <SyntaxNinja> y = 4
07:34:33 <SyntaxNinja> asdf = $(fooTest "x")
07:34:33 <SyntaxNinja> asdf = $(fooTest "x")
07:34:45 <SyntaxNinja> strange that the last line pasted twice
07:34:47 <SyntaxNinja> but anyway...
07:35:03 <SyntaxNinja>     tcLookup: `x' is not in scope
07:35:04 <SyntaxNinja>     In the definition of `asdf': asdf = $[splice](fooTest "x")
07:35:26 <SyntaxNinja> I don't understand why x isn't in scope.
07:36:15 <shapr> you think I should put the IOHCC wiki page on HaWiki?
07:36:57 <shapr> HaWiki is gaining content lately :-)
07:37:14 <shapr> thanks to TheHunter and Cale
07:40:17 <Igloo> Syn: If you put a $( return [] ) before the asdf definition it'll work
07:41:05 <Igloo> I think it's a bug, though
07:41:31 <Igloo> But I'm not entirely sure
07:42:38 <SyntaxNinja> strange
07:42:49 <SyntaxNinja> I would say that either your workaround or my example demonstrate a bug ;)
07:43:28 <SyntaxNinja> thanks a lot, though. at least I know I'm not crazy!
07:43:29 <Igloo> My workaround splits the definitions into two binding groups
07:44:21 <SyntaxNinja> what is a binding group?
07:45:47 <SyntaxNinja> looks like he found out what a binding group is... the hard way
08:17:55 <bourbaki> hi
08:19:06 <bourbaki> how do i write an application loop in haskell?
08:19:36 <bourbaki> hi Igloo
08:19:54 <Igloo> Hi
08:21:18 <Lemmih> application loop? appLoop io = io >> appLoop io?
08:21:50 <bourbaki> something that runs my programm all the time
08:22:02 <bourbaki> i dont do that with a recursion do i?
08:22:22 <Lemmih> There's nothing else.
08:22:46 <bourbaki> isnt that very memory intense?
08:23:06 <bourbaki> i remember that i did something like that in lisp once and it ate all my memory
08:23:39 <Lemmih> I don't think so since it's supposed to optimize tail calls.
08:24:00 <Lemmih> (Or whatever it's called)
08:24:15 <Amadan> bourbaki: interact?
08:24:39 <bourbaki> Amadan yes like that
08:25:26 <CrewdenX> i don't remember there being any requirement that lisp optimize tail recursion, just most lisp environments do.  i know scheme has that requirement.
08:26:33 <Lemmih> bourbaki, Don't you wan't to loop an IO action?
08:26:48 <Lemmih> *want
08:28:20 <bourbaki> yes such that you can type something in or use the mouse and such
08:32:37 <Lemmih> Is there some reason my `appLoop` would be evil/bad?
08:34:13 <bourbaki> hm i dont know i will try that :)
08:35:18 <SyntaxNinja> hi Igloo
08:36:36 <bourbaki> Lemmih what would be the type signature of your loop?
08:36:40 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: I'm kinda weirded out by another message I'm getting from TH... [True <- (&&) ((==) sym'0 12) ((==) sym'1 21), System.IO.print "match!"]
08:36:47 <SyntaxNinja> Warning: accepting non-standard pattern guards (-fglasgow-exts to suppress this message)
08:36:57 <SyntaxNinja> except that I don't know why it thinks I"m using pattern guards.
08:37:35 <SyntaxNinja> is the "guardedB" function now for pattern guards only?
08:37:35 <Lemmih> bourbaki, appLoop :: forall b m a. (Monad m) => m a -> m b
08:37:39 <SyntaxNinja> or do things get converted into pattern guarsd?
08:38:22 <Lemmih> bourbaki, Or just `appLoop :: IO () -> IO ()`
08:38:33 <SyntaxNinja> btw, that expression should actually be [(True (&&) ((==) sym'0 12) ((==) sym'1 21), System.IO.print "match!")] afaik
08:38:52 <Igloo> It could be a generic transformation is being done - can you give me a complete small example?
08:38:54 <SyntaxNinja> er  [(True (&&) ((==) sym'0 12) && ((==) sym'1 21), System.IO.print "match!")]
08:38:55 <bourbaki> Lemmih and io is a function also?
08:38:57 <Lemmih> bourbaki, It depends on how generic you want it.
08:39:26 <SyntaxNinja> btw, it seems to have the correct behavior.
08:39:28 <Lemmih> bourbaki: Well, it's an IO action so yes.
08:40:03 <bourbaki> Lemmih and what type signature does that io function has then?
08:40:07 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: I'll work on it...
08:40:15 <Lemmih> bourbaki, IO ()
08:40:56 <bourbaki> hm and what would an implementation of that function then look like?
08:41:28 <Lemmih> Like `main` or `putStrLn "Hello world!"`.
08:42:52 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: yeah, pretty easy:
08:42:53 <SyntaxNinja> tester _ = sequence [funD "defaultMain"
08:42:53 <SyntaxNinja>                      [clause [] (guardedB [([| True |], [|print "food"|] )]) []]]
08:43:10 <SyntaxNinja> then splice that in wherever
08:43:19 <SyntaxNinja> you might need -Wall, not sure.
08:45:33 <bourbaki> ah ok thank you
08:50:09 <Igloo> Hmm, same in CVS. Ta.
08:50:44 <SyntaxNinja> cool. I'm guessing it's a generic transformation.
08:51:33 <Igloo> Yeah, but CVS knows about pattern guards too, so it might have happened to have been fixed
09:01:47 <bourbaki> SyntaxNinja is that a dynamic language support of haskell?
09:05:33 <SyntaxNinja> bourbaki: it's Template Haskell :)
09:06:09 <bourbaki> template haskell?:)
09:08:31 <SyntaxNinja> http://www.haskell.org/th/
09:36:53 <shapr> @yow ! excitement !
09:36:54 <lambdabot> CONGRATULATIONS!  Now should I make thinly veiled comments about
09:36:54 <lambdabot>  DIGNITY, self-esteem and finding TRUE FUN in your RIGHT VENTRICLE??
10:12:42 <shapr> wheeee
10:13:52 <stepcut> wheee
10:14:07 <Lemmih> whee
10:14:18 <stepcut> http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2004/08/02/local/10053164.txt
10:14:22 <stepcut> (for shapr)
10:15:38 <shapr> heh "it keeps you honest"
10:15:41 <shapr> truly
10:15:50 <shapr> I've learned a lot about focus from unicycling.
10:16:10 <shapr> momentary distractions can be painful.
10:16:20 <stepcut> hah
10:17:18 <shapr> I bet he's using a coker.
10:17:21 * shapr wants a coker.
10:17:43 <shapr> if he's using something like a 20" wheel, I'm amazed he's gotten that far.
10:18:32 <shapr> it's true about feeling every feature on the road, even the smallest angle change means you speed up, slow down, or fall over.
10:18:54 <shapr> sure is fun though.
10:19:04 <shapr> Unicycling is like playing chess with gravity. -- Shae Erisson
10:19:32 <thebug> <and losing, if you're me --Ryan>
10:22:40 <Amadan> shapr: did you see this then? 24" across USA... with no bus rides: http://www.unicycling.org/unicycling/tales/kcash.html
10:23:25 <shapr> Yikes and it's a SCHWINN. Those are serious ass-busters.
10:23:55 <shapr> I'm not that brave/masochistic/whatever.
10:24:09 <shapr> My unicycle is named Haskell.
10:24:32 <Amadan> :)
10:24:45 <shapr> Beatrice wants me to purchase a bicycle named Python ;-)
10:25:14 <bourbaki> hi
10:25:18 <shapr> y0
10:25:19 <Amadan> ... anyway you guys got me interested enough to consider purchasing one
10:25:25 <shapr> it's fun!
10:25:33 <bourbaki> ip6 ?:)
10:25:38 <shapr> that too
10:25:41 <Amadan> :)
10:25:44 <shapr> but I was really talking about unicycling.
10:25:47 <bourbaki> ah
10:26:38 <Amadan> so i thought i'd get a word from an expert... i thought getting one from ebay.de - i see that these are all pretty cheap, but they look ok - taiwanese, i think...
10:26:39 <shapr> das machst spaﬂ
10:27:03 <bourbaki> :)
10:27:24 <Amadan> price matters to me, but i still wouldn't like to get a piece of crap that will take me three times as long to learn on
10:27:33 <shapr> right, hmmm
10:27:34 * shapr thinks
10:28:10 <shapr> well, I got a Dodger with a 20" wheel and drop thingies on the seat.
10:28:28 <shapr> unless you're much shorter than me, I'd recommend a 24 inch wheel.
10:29:07 <shapr> I got my unicycle for 1000 kronor, or around a hundred euro.
10:29:27 <shapr> g'day blackdog_
10:29:44 <SyntaxNinja> hey blackdog_ what's-a-you-been-up-to?
10:29:47 <shapr> well, maybe a 20" wheel would be good for learning, you'd get good leverage.
10:30:14 <shapr> Amadan: how tall are you? how much do you weigh?
10:30:48 <shapr> Amadan: this is what I have: http://www.unicycle.se/shop/shopdisplayproduct.asp?catalogid=3
10:30:50 <Amadan> hrm... heh... 100kg, about 175cm
10:31:03 <shapr> oh, that's almost the same as me.
10:31:46 <shapr> I think it'll be easier to learn (and do tricks) on a 20 inch, but it'll be easier to actually get somewhere on a 24 inch.
10:32:26 <Amadan> i don't know yet about getting somewhere, i live in the capital and i think i'd be scared going downtown on one wheel
10:32:59 <shapr> it's easier than you mightthink. Once you can ride it at all, you have a lot of mobility.
10:33:22 <Amadan> and my workplace is 30min car ride away from my house... :(
10:33:35 <shapr> do you have sidewalks between your house and your work?
10:33:41 <Amadan> but it seems like such a great recreation
10:33:50 <shapr> yes, it is.
10:34:07 <shapr> if you get to the point where you want to commute between work and home, you can do it with a Coker.
10:34:21 <Amadan> yes, but.
10:34:39 <shapr> coker : http://www.unicycle.se/shop/shopdisplayproduct.asp?catalogid=21
10:34:48 <Amadan> somewhere crowded, somewhere parked-over, and somewhere holy (i.e. full of holes) :)
10:35:06 <shapr> sure, I've read about some guys who commute via unicycle in London.
10:36:17 <shapr> You'll probably need to get up to the skill level where you can freemount, and jump up on a curb, but that's not so hard.
10:36:37 <Amadan> can't use unicycle.se, their delivery options are too scandinavian for me.
10:36:54 <shapr> They have a co.uk branch, maybe that will work?
10:37:46 <Amadan> they sell dms, i haven't read good reviews about them...
10:38:57 <shapr> they have the trainer http://www.unicycle.uk.com/shop/shopdisplayproduct.asp?catalogid=147
10:39:04 <shapr> that's what they recommend for those over 75kg
10:39:50 <shapr> their shipping to .hr is "contact us" :-/
10:40:25 <Amadan> that's pretty much similar to what i find on ebay.de
10:40:26 <Amadan> http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=30742&item=5110531577&rd=1
10:41:20 <shapr> that looks ok from the pic
10:41:31 <shapr> not sure about the frame though
10:42:36 <Amadan> what about the frame?
10:43:09 <Amadan> (or this: http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5111625859#description  -- i think they're more or less all the same)
10:43:30 <shapr> after comparing the detail pics to my own unicycle, I think it'll be fine.
10:43:43 <Amadan> thanks
10:44:07 <shapr> :-)
10:48:02 * shapr bounces happily
10:50:30 <stepcut> maybe I should get a unicycle for getting around the office :-/
10:50:52 <stepcut> shapr: can you juggle and unicycle yet ?
10:51:24 <Riastradh> Or juggle unicycles?
10:51:25 <shapr> no, not yet.
10:51:35 <shapr> but I haven't tried it yet...
10:57:29 <shapr> I did find a sort of nearby juggling club.
11:03:20 <shapr> greetz Heffalump 
11:03:22 <shapr> how's code?
11:03:23 <Heffalump> yo
11:03:25 <Heffalump> not bad
11:17:30 * Lemmih is trying to learn how to juggle while pendling.
11:22:06 <shapr> hiyauz
11:22:23 * shapr notices that stepcut doesn't have a HaWiki paeg.
11:22:24 <shapr> page
11:22:26 <shapr> foo, I can't spell.
11:24:17 <shapr> ok, any comments on this before I send it off? http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ObfuscatedHaskellContest
11:24:38 <shapr> Heffalump: have a moment to see if I've made any obvious mistakes on the latest IOHCC announcement?
11:25:33 <Heffalump> can't see any
11:25:59 <shapr> Cale: I can ban the whole subnet if you think it's worth it, is that a habitual spammer?
11:26:02 <shapr> greetz Si\ 
11:26:05 <shapr> Heffalump: thanks
11:26:07 <Si\> hi
11:26:12 <shapr> ok then, I'll send off the announcement.
11:26:25 <shapr> Si\: want to enter the IOHCC?
11:26:33 <Cale> shapr: I wonder what would happen if you banned the creation of the page "Weroom"
11:26:48 <shapr> I'll see if I can do that
11:26:57 <Si\> do you know of any library which allows you to enter a textual template as a regex and then some how pass it and some data to a processor to an actual string?
11:27:03 <Si\> IOHCC?
11:27:08 <Cale> I've deleted it 3-4 times now.
11:27:12 <shapr> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ObfuscatedHaskellContest
11:27:46 <shapr> oh, I could create Weroom and chmod ugo-w on it. Then it becomes immutable.
11:27:59 * shapr thinks of putting spammer taunts on that page.
11:28:35 <shapr> Si\: that sounds a tiny bit like Halipeto
11:28:46 <shapr> or maybe like some of the showS stuff
11:29:07 <Si\> by a template, I mean for example you'd have a template like "class $ a where\n($ :: $)*"
11:29:13 <shapr> ohh
11:29:17 <shapr> template haskell?
11:30:20 <shapr> hiya hztk_pak, looking for Haskell info?
11:31:22 <Si\> I was thinking that would be parsed and then you'd pass it some sort of data structure (e.g. Sequence [Token "ID", Star [Token "getID", "a -> ID"]])
11:31:44 <Si\> isn't TH an extension to Haskell itself?
11:32:02 <SyntaxNinja> speaking of TH, is "AsP a b" like this: "a@b"?
11:32:31 <shapr> Cale: ok, that page is immutable now. I hope the taunts aren't too much :-)
11:32:47 * shapr cackles evilly
11:33:09 <Cale> heheh
11:34:08 <Cale> Si\: http://www.haskell.org/th/
11:34:29 <Heffalump> what's immutable?
11:34:33 <Heffalump> IM which page is
11:34:38 <Cale> "Weroom"
11:35:11 <Heffalump> ahh
11:36:05 <hztk_pak> [shapr] Hi , sorry
11:36:36 <hztk_pak> [shapr] yeap. i¥m looking about what¥s haskell
11:37:15 <Si\> is Template Haskell any good for writing Haskell code in Haskell?
11:37:44 <shapr> Si\: yes!
11:37:59 <Cale> hztk_pak: you'll want to get ghc and a good tutorial then - I generally recommend http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/tutorial.pdf
11:38:15 <hztk_pak> [Cale] thanks
11:38:18 <Cale> There's some general info about the language at haskell.org
11:38:24 <Si\> so it does a similar job to Language.Haskell.*?
11:38:42 <shapr> hztk_pak: there's good links to lots of learning resources here: http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
11:39:05 <hztk_pak> [shapr] that links is broken
11:39:24 <sorrow> shapr, I'm no native speaker, but "your code must an original work" somehow doesn't sound right.
11:39:30 <Cale> I'm pretty sure that link works - at least, it does for me :)
11:39:42 <Cale> (the learning page)
11:40:30 <hztk_pak> [Cale] mmmm i¥ll check it again
11:40:48 <shapr> sorrow: whoops, thanks
11:41:00 <hztk_pak> :P it works :P
11:41:44 <Cale> Here's a page on why Haskell (and FP in general) matters: http://www.haskell.org/complex/why_does_haskell_matter.html
11:42:53 <shapr> ok, unless any other types are found, I'll send off the IOHCC announcement.
11:42:58 <shapr> ahem "TYPOS"
11:43:06 <shapr> geez, I can't believe I mistyped that word.
11:43:16 * thebug finds an Int
11:43:28 * shapr smacks thebug with a tuple
11:43:32 <thebug> :)
11:43:44 * Riastradh monomorphizes shapr.
11:44:03 * shapr hylomorphizes Riastradh 
11:45:09 * Riastradh is mapped to himself.
11:46:00 <SyntaxNinja> :type Riastradh . map . map
11:46:04 * Cale takes the least fixed point of Riastradh's endomorphism
11:49:17 <shapr> oh, I bet the iohcc mailing list shouldn't have public archives
11:49:26 <shapr> and I should only let the judges subscribe...
11:49:42 * Riastradh anamorphizes himself back into normal existence.
11:50:02 <Cale> SUBSCIRBE
11:50:35 <Cale> I love it when people typo "subscribe" when trying to subscribe to a mailing list.
11:51:33 <shapr> I wonder how many IOHCC submissions we'll get this time.
11:51:50 <shapr> stepcut: hey, can I subscribe you to the list? or do you want to subscribe yourself?
11:52:15 <Heffalump> Igloo and I have an idea, but we probably won't have time to implement it properly.
12:01:49 <stepcut> shapr: go for it!
12:01:51 <Cale> Would there be problems with having something of the form  replaceError :: (String -> b) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> b), where if the second function passed called "error" with a given string, then this would simply be passed to the first function to produce a value of type b?
12:04:53 <shapr> sounds like catch or fromError
12:05:04 <Cale> oh, there is a fromError?
12:05:14 <shapr> no, but that's what you want, yes?
12:05:22 <shapr> @index fromError
12:05:23 <lambdabot> bzzt
12:05:26 <shapr> nope
12:05:34 <Cale> well, that seems like a reasonable name for it
12:05:53 <shapr> @type catch
12:05:57 <Cale> Just thinking about the discussion on the cafe list
12:05:59 <lambdabot> catch :: forall a. IO a -> (IOError -> IO a) -> IO a
12:07:12 <monochrom> Suppose a value v has type a->b.  How do you know v is bottom?
12:08:01 <Cale> It wouldn't catch nontermination of course :)
12:08:24 <monochrom> It wouldn't catch errors either.
12:11:04 <Cale> I mean that (replaceError h f) would be the same as calling f where every instance of error in the definition of f was replaced by h
12:12:12 <Cale> well, almost :)
12:12:29 <monochrom> That can't be done. But there are several ways of compromising.
12:12:43 <Cale> (error str) would cause f to return (h str) immediately
12:12:56 <Cale> okay
12:14:30 <monochrom> (String -> b) -> (a -> Maybe b) -> (a -> b)  is implementable.
12:14:51 <monochrom> Ah you want the exception to hold a string.
12:14:59 <monochrom> (String -> b) -> (a -> Either b String) -> (a -> b)  is implementable.
12:15:11 <Cale> yes, I was typing that :)
12:15:54 <Cale> I'm quite aware of Either, and all that. Just trying to think of ways to deal with the problems caused by, e.g. Prelude.head
12:15:57 <monochrom> The IO monad also has something to the same effect, as shapr mentioned.
12:16:49 <monochrom> Another entire different angle is dynamic scoping (horror!)
12:18:30 <monochrom> ghc also has some kind of exception mechanism.
12:19:55 <monochrom> Lastly, you can think of it as overloading "error" and so there is also a typeclass solution.
12:20:38 <monochrom> But of all these approaches, only dynamic scoping or a universal exception system will require no change to existing code.
12:21:49 <Cale> It would be nice if, when error was called, it would at least print the name/file/location of the caller
12:22:02 <Cale> well, actually you want more than that
12:22:22 <Cale> but tracing why it was called seems tricky
12:23:07 <monochrom> That requires an entirely different runtime system.
12:23:12 <Cale> yeah
12:23:57 <monochrom> So different that there is already one.  If you compile Haskell to Java or Jave bytecode, the JVM will be glad to do it for you. :)
12:24:12 <Cale> heh :)
12:50:49 <bringert> shapr: cool iohcc announcement
12:51:04 <bringert> is there a homepage?
13:17:53 <det> shapr: Succ Zero :p
13:50:10 <shapr> bringert: um, not really.
13:50:16 <shapr> there will be soon, I'm sure.
13:50:52 <shapr> bringert: hey, shall I subscribe you to the list?
13:51:08 <bringert> sounds good
13:51:30 <shapr> via dtek?
13:54:05 <shapr> yay, the Succ Zero IOHCC contest has started!
14:54:27 * SyntaxNinja uploads new darcs to debian
14:54:29 * SyntaxNinja goes home &
15:02:15 <bourbaki> hi
16:45:23 <bourbaki> hm does haskell do something like garbage collection?
16:45:31 <Heffalump> yes
16:45:33 <monochrom> Yes.
16:45:47 <Pseudonym> Very much like it.
16:46:10 <bourbaki> hm
16:46:17 <bourbaki> http://codemages.sourceforge.net/codemages/cm.html
16:46:21 <Pseudonym> I believe that GHC is one of the very few (possibly the only!) commonly used language implementation with a generational collector.
16:46:43 <bourbaki> whats that?
16:48:01 <Pseudonym> It's a collection mechanism which concentrates on short-lived heap cells.
16:48:15 <monochrom> "generational" is the name of a garbage collection algorithm.  It divides garbage into generations by age.
16:48:25 <bourbaki> ah
16:48:27 <Pseudonym> The theory is that in lazy languages like Haskell, an object is often garbage soon after it's produced.
16:48:40 <Pseudonym> Because objects are produced "on demand".
16:48:55 <monochrom> Err, it divides memory cells (garbage or not) into generations by age.
16:49:04 <bourbaki> yeah i think if i want to do something like a game that might be a bit of a problem right?
16:49:41 <dxlvi> o_O
16:50:08 <monochrom> It assumes: old guys tend to be used even more, new guys tend to die young.  So you want to skip old guys.
16:50:31 <Pseudonym> It depends on the game.
16:50:45 <Pseudonym> GHC doesn't have a real-time or concurrent collector.
16:50:55 <Pseudonym> So if you're talking about a first person shooter...
16:51:18 <Pseudonym> The thing is, games are the exception in the software industry.
16:51:27 <bourbaki> yes
16:51:32 <Pseudonym> Always.  No matter what the rules, games are the exception.
16:51:46 <Pseudonym> So you shouldn't be surprised that most software tools aren't oriented towards games.
16:51:47 <bourbaki> i can not agree with you more
16:52:07 <Pseudonym> Including most of the ones that are used for games!
16:52:10 <bourbaki> i never did so :) but i still try to do my little game though :)
16:53:49 <monochrom> What about the rule "games are the exception"?  Are games an exception to that rule?
16:53:55 <Pseudonym> Yes.
16:54:26 <bourbaki> :)
16:54:45 <Pseudonym> It's the exception that proves the rule, in that case.
16:55:28 <bourbaki> i think that you just have to come up with a new way of thinking if you want to write a game in a language like haskell instead of c++
17:00:28 <det> Pseudonym: ocaml has generational GC
17:00:35 <Pseudonym> Ah, OK.
17:00:39 <shapr> y0 Pseudonym 
17:00:44 <Pseudonym> G'day.
17:00:48 <shapr> wassup?
17:00:52 <Pseudonym> Oh, not much.
17:00:58 <Pseudonym> Way too busy.
17:01:11 <shapr> hopefully you'll have time to be an IOHCC juror :-)
17:01:25 <Pseudonym> Oh, I'm sure I can fit that in. :-)
17:01:33 <dxlvi> international obfuscated haskell coding contest?
17:01:39 <shapr> that is correct.
17:01:42 <shapr> announced today
17:01:44 <dxlvi> @_@
17:01:45 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "_@", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
17:01:49 <dxlvi> lol
17:01:54 <shapr> well, the Succ Zero-th IOHCC was announced today.
17:02:14 <shapr> Pseudonym: I created a mailing list too
17:02:23 <Pseudonym> OK.  Did you subscribe me?
17:02:35 <shapr> wasn't sure which address to use
17:02:46 <Pseudonym> Fairy nuff.  I'll sign up then.
17:04:34 * shapr wonders if there's a pun between first-person shooter and new guys dying young.
17:04:50 <Pseudonym> I doubt it.
17:05:01 <Pseudonym> You'd be surprised how few puns there are.
17:05:18 <shapr> oh Pseudonym, any good papers lately?
17:05:23 <shapr> I'm in need of input.
17:06:51 <Pseudonym> Let's see...
17:07:10 <det> monochrom: haha nice paradox
17:07:33 <Pseudonym> I read the gettext manual.
17:07:45 <monochrom> I am great at making these paradoxes.
17:08:06 <Pseudonym> monochrom is not great at making these paradoxes.
17:08:11 <Pseudonym> Oddly enough, we both told the truth!
17:08:45 <monochrom> When Hoare came visit our reading group, we each introduced ourselves around the table.
17:09:28 <monochrom> I ran the reading group.  It makes perfect sense to say, in case someone doesn't want to introduce himself, "I introduce exactly those who don't introduce themselves."
17:10:20 <Pseudonym> Oh, "enumerating the rationals" was a fun paper.
17:10:26 <Pseudonym> So was "church numerals, twice!"
17:10:40 <Pseudonym> If you haven't read them do it.  Quite light reading.
17:10:58 <shapr> ok
17:14:44 * Pseudonym assumes you've read the paper on GADTs
17:16:33 <Cale> My favourite way to make sure that the rationals are countable is actually not to enumerate them, but to use the injection (-1)^r p/q -> (-1)^r 2^p 3^q to show that they can injectively map to a subset of the integers, and of course, there's a natural injection from Z to Q. So then they must have the same cardinality.
17:17:52 <Pseudonym> Definitely, because that works for extensions to rationals too.
17:18:18 <Pseudonym> This paper, though, has an enumeration which uses only the previous rational to generate the next one.
17:47:05 * shapr bounces
18:00:56 <shapr> hiya binary42 
18:01:00 <shapr> looking for Haskell info?
18:01:25 <binary42> nah... just sitting in.
18:01:29 <bourbaki> :)
18:01:50 * binary42 sometimes does regexp searches on his logs though.
18:05:02 * shapr reads about functional morphology
18:06:02 <bourbaki> shapr whats that?
18:06:16 <shapr> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~markus/FM/
18:06:40 <shapr> morphology is word inflection
18:06:59 <shapr> like when the same word has different forms for plural, singular, masculine, feminine
18:07:17 <bourbaki> oh interesting
18:07:18 <shapr> dog/dogs
18:07:33 <bourbaki> we did a morphology for some african language 
18:07:38 <bourbaki> forgot the name though :)
18:09:57 <bourbaki> kanuri i think it was
18:12:19 <shapr> sounds nifty
18:13:23 <bourbaki> yeah it was interesting that is not that easy to do with automatons we really had to think :)
18:16:26 <dxlvi> >_<
20:20:58 <Cale> dxlvi: >_< ?
20:21:19 <dxlvi> err
20:21:47 <dxlvi> i typed /part #haskell by mistake >_<
20:21:51 <Cale> ah
