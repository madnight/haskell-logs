00:29:42 <shammahs> Pseudonym, where are you?  That looks like a .au timezone (says he looking at a timestamp of 16:09 attached to that comment ;)
00:30:43 <ozone> he's in melbourne
00:30:53 <ozone> <- sydneian
00:43:44 <jesse99> damn, i hate how hard c++ makes it to attractively lay out a header
01:10:02 <shammah> <- brisbanian
01:29:03 <earthy> <- dutchman :P
01:29:10 <earthy> good morning to you antipodals! :)
02:00:28 <stefan_> kosmikus: yep, Frank's observations hit the nail on the head :)
02:12:10 <musasabi> Would a ASN.1 -> Haskell (types + encoder + decoder) or a Haskell -> (ASN.1 + encoder + decoder) be more usefull?
02:13:59 <Lor> asn.1 -> haskell
02:14:41 <Lor> I once designed a neato arrow-based xml parser library, where you build up a parser object with combinators, and you could produce a DTD automatically from that.
02:15:05 <Lor> So that direction is sensible, too.
02:15:53 <musasabi> It seems that ASN.1 is the most sensible from the various on wire transport protocols
02:18:53 <Lor> asn.1 has seemed interesting, but all web resources are full off corporate hype-fluff.
02:19:18 <musasabi> true, but having used it a few times it seems to have many good sides.
02:19:29 <musasabi> although xdr could also be used in a sensible way.
02:19:37 <Lor> Do you have a pointer to some sensible technical documentation about it?
02:20:26 <musasabi> "ASN.1 - Communication between heterogenous systems" can be downloaded for free in pdf form
02:20:45 <Lor> What's asn.1's legal status, anyway?
02:20:55 * Lor is suspicious of anything used extensively in the industry.
02:21:00 <musasabi> well it is an ITU protocoll.
02:21:22 <musasabi> The thing about ASN.1 is that it is not "cool" like XML is.
02:21:48 <musasabi> And that the standard is quite large and one usually uses just a small sensible subset of it.
02:25:05 <musasabi> but please tell me if you know a better way to transfer things over wire.
02:25:12 <Lor> I have long ago contemplated designing something like asn.1... a pure data definition language, with then language bindings that map abstract data types to data structures in a language, and various serialization formats, and automatic marshaller generation, and whatnot...
02:25:30 <Lor> Something like CORBA, but without all the object crud, just plain data transfer.
02:28:39 <musasabi> yes, CORBA suffers from the crud problem...
02:29:37 <musasabi> ASN.1 with Aligned Canonical PER encoding is quite nice.
02:30:13 <ozone> Lor: there's also EBML <http://ebml.sf.net/>
02:30:21 <ozone> (disclaimer: i haven't used EBML)
02:31:05 <Lor> Does it support polymorphism?
02:31:46 <musasabi> ozone: does EBML have anything over ASN.1/XDR ?
02:32:11 <musasabi> or is it just one another "let's reinvent the wheel, because we don't believe in google" ?
02:32:14 <ozone> lor: hm, maybe i'm getting confused about what ASN.1
02:32:19 <ozone> +is
02:32:30 <Lor> Does asn.1 support polymorphism, for that matter?
02:32:33 <ozone> EBML is XML, but with tags etc. in binary rather than ASCII
02:32:41 <ozone> still, it's cheap and cheery
02:32:48 <Lor> Sounds very silly.
02:33:24 <ozone> if you need a hierarchical container format which can store binary data, it seems quite suitable
02:35:21 <Lor> Um.
02:35:41 <musasabi> Lor: yes, a kind of.
02:36:04 <Lor> No, still doesn't make sense. Just converting xml to binary makes it less legible but doesn't buy much.
02:36:42 <musasabi> ozone: so it is just length-prefixed-simplified xml?
02:37:15 <ozone> musasabi: not sure, i know of its existence, i don't know detailed specs about it
02:37:32 <musasabi> ozone: does not seem very worthwhile..
02:37:58 <Lor> For instance, any ML-ish or Haskell-ish datatype can easily be encoded to binary very efficiently.
02:38:05 <ozone> forget i mentioned it then. :)
02:38:52 <Lor> But in ebml they would probably be horribly bloated.
02:39:29 <tic> Didn't people invest chunky binary formats eons ago?
02:39:35 <tic> s/invest/invent
02:39:53 <musasabi> yep.
02:40:27 <musasabi> the thing is that which one would be the most suitable in a haskell context.
02:45:14 <tic> musasabi, bah, just write a pickler module, as in Python, and save the content flat-soup :)
02:45:56 <shapr> greetings MiklKurkov 
02:46:13 <shapr> MiklKurkov: are you new to Haskell? or a longtime user?
02:47:07 <shapr> hiya cptchaos 
02:47:20 <cptchaos> hi shapr
02:47:26 * shapr bounces
02:47:34 <cptchaos> what's up?
02:47:52 <shapr> randomness
02:48:03 <musasabi> tic: I have my own save to binary format module too...
02:48:11 <shapr> musasabi: Dominic Steinitz wrote some ASN.1 BER code for an LDAP browser he wrote.
02:48:16 <shapr> it's quite nice
02:48:19 <musasabi> but something standard would be nice...
02:48:24 * musasabi looks that uo
02:48:27 <musasabi> *up
02:48:36 <shapr> I probably have a copy around here somewhere if you can't find it.
02:49:08 <shapr> originally it only supported BER, and didn't have pluggable encoding for DER, XER, etc
02:49:38 <shapr> but I thought someone used parts of it in PKCS readers in the Haskell Crypto collect.
02:49:40 <shapr> collection
02:50:45 <musasabi> yes, I am downloading that currently
02:53:49 <musasabi> yes, it has an ASN.1 encoder/decoder.
02:53:55 <musasabi> not automatic though... 
02:55:35 <musasabi> maybe with template haskell... or would boilerplate be better?
03:07:02 * shapr isn't sure
03:11:17 * shapr bounces happily
03:11:25 <shapr> mmm, an iohcc submission from chalmers...
03:12:57 <musasabi> Why is mkT defined in the way it is (ghc sources and boilerplate papers)?
03:13:10 <musasabi> "mkT f = maybe id id (cast f)" would seem simpler to me.
03:14:59 <shapr> yow, I'm scared of anything that freely mixes Data.Generics and Template Haskell in the same module.
03:29:53 <musasabi> any comments why the former is better than the latter?
03:30:08 * musasabi tries to learn what constitutes good and bad style.
03:33:49 <musasabi> and mkM would be simplified to mkM f = maybe return id (cast f)
04:17:05 <musasabi> Why is ghc documentation in the web incorrect?
04:17:17 <musasabi> it speaks about constrIndex when the real thing is conIndex.
04:18:14 <musasabi> no wait.
04:18:33 <musasabi> It seems that the boilerplate page links to old versions of the documentation...
04:33:57 <shapr> wheee
04:40:16 <Lemmih> whooo
04:40:39 * shapr boings randomly
04:41:43 <shapr> hiya Iter 
04:41:53 <shammahs> hey there shapr.
04:41:56 <shapr> wassup?
04:42:30 <shammahs> remember we were talking a few months back about trying to explain continuations to C programmers?
04:43:25 <shammahs> well I've actually gone and written up half of the explaination I referred to.  I'd appreciate feedback if you have an inclination and half a chance.
04:44:51 <Lor> Do you mention setjmp there?
04:45:00 <Lor> (Not that the majority of C programmers even know what it is...)
04:45:34 <earthy> (Not that you'd *want* the majority of C programmers to know what it is :))
04:45:43 <shammahs> no, not yet.  I've only got as far as CPS so far, still writing up the rest.
04:47:33 <Igloo> Can't you only have 1 setjmp at a time? Does that suffice?
04:48:13 <earthy> nope, you have a jmp_buf env
04:48:31 <shammahs> http://etymon.blogspot.com/2004/08/continuations-part-2.html <- main description if anyone is interested.
04:48:35 <earthy> and you can obviously have multiple such environments
04:48:35 <Igloo> OK, dunno why I thought that then
04:49:12 <shammahs> Igloo, probably because the stack restrictions render using more than one uncommon.
04:52:28 <Lor> You can use it for exceptions, and you can have multiple handlers active simultaneously.
04:56:14 <Aglarion> hi
04:56:17 <shapr> gutentag Aglarion 
04:56:32 <Aglarion> hi shapr
04:58:23 <Aglarion> unfortunately i don't know how to greet people in swedish
04:58:28 <shapr> hej
04:58:41 <shapr> not so different :-)
04:58:49 <goron> hej shapr
04:58:55 <Aglarion> hej shapr :-)
04:59:19 <shapr> or you can use Alabama greetings, which range from 'yo, wassup?' in part of the culture to 'howdy' in another part.
05:01:23 <Aglarion> if u greet a german with howdy, he'll think you're crazy
05:01:35 <Aglarion> unless it is a good friend :-)
05:02:36 <shammahs> Aglarion, I'm not surprised.  Same in .au, and our language is alot closer to alabamian ;)
05:04:01 <Aglarion> must be, since alabamian is english dialect, or am i all wrong?
05:04:26 <shapr> most people think so.
05:04:38 <shammahs> agarion: so it is claimed, although I'm not sure there's enough proof to be certain.
05:04:46 <Lemmih> Why do people think that MSN nicks should be an explanation of what they've been doing the last 6 months /-:
05:05:08 <shapr> consider the target demographic of MSN
05:05:25 * Aglarion does not have a msn nick
05:05:45 <Aglarion> need something more to eat... brb
05:06:12 <shammahs> dinner arrived brb.
05:07:27 <Aglarion> its lunchtime here
05:07:30 <shapr> there's a strange tradeoff between 'usability' or something, and the quality of a community.
05:10:15 <shammahs> Aglarion, You're ~1400hrs aren't you?
05:10:21 <Aglarion> does anybody know where the "South Sandwich Islands" lie?
05:10:43 <Aglarion> right
05:11:35 <shammahs> absolutely no idea (as you guessed :)
05:12:06 <shapr> that should be hawaai, right?
05:12:27 <shapr> was it hawaii that was originally called the sandwich islands?
05:12:54 <shapr> I know the word sandwich came from the earl of sandwich, he played cards obsessively and hated getting meat juice on his cards
05:13:11 <shapr> so he got his cook to put the meat between bread slices so his cards would stay clean
05:14:04 <Aglarion> i don't know... i found it in a table about which national shorthands (don't know the right word... the .?? in urls) and i thought it sounded funny
05:14:16 <shapr> ah, top level domains
05:14:18 <shapr> TLDs
05:14:49 <Aglarion> well... i thought there was another word, since these shorthands are used elsewhere too (such as for languages)
05:14:59 <shapr> language codes
05:15:06 <shapr> I don't know if there's one word for both of those.
05:15:14 <Aglarion> in german it's "Länderkürzel" which means both
05:15:18 <Aglarion> but thanks :)
05:15:26 <shammahs> http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/sx.html
05:16:04 <shammahs> The islands lie approximately 1,000 km east of the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration since 1908, except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina occupied them.
05:16:26 <shapr> wow, the only landmass that argentina and the UK have contested.
05:16:30 <Aglarion> shammahs: i just read this too
05:16:33 <shammahs> sometimes I'm rather fond of google.
05:16:39 <shapr> google is the smart half of my brain.
05:16:43 <Aglarion> lol
05:17:29 <Aglarion> do i have to be afraid that the cia is publishing such information? i guess theres a secret hidden link on this page that will show agents the more interesting information :-)
05:17:47 <bringert> country TLDs use the ISO standard two-letter country abbreviations, I think
05:17:48 <shapr> yah, that little pi symbol on the bottom right corner maybe.
05:17:58 <shapr> you just have to shift-click on it to break into the CIA database
05:18:09 <shapr> what was that movie?
05:18:22 <shapr> bringert: aha, ISO country abbreviations, that sounds good.
05:18:38 <bringert> somthing with sandra bullock I think
05:18:45 <Aglarion> its "the net"
05:19:03 <shapr> oh right, that's where a PC virus infects a mainframe, I remember that.
05:19:12 <Aglarion> yip
05:19:15 <shapr> I was writhing in pain in the theater.
05:19:33 <shapr> and all my friends were like "dude, it's not that unrealistic, you're just a geek."
05:20:09 <Aglarion> i always like movies with totatlly exaggerated computer scenes
05:20:13 <Aglarion> like "Hackers"
05:20:19 <Aglarion> have u ever seen this one?
05:20:21 <musasabi> Is there any tutorial on building rank-2 types in haskell?
05:20:22 <shapr> um
05:20:38 <shammahs> hey wow.  an actual haskell question!?
05:20:40 <shapr> was that the one with 'Crash and Burn' the girl and boy crackers?
05:20:49 <Igloo> Yup
05:20:50 <Aglarion> think so
05:20:52 <shapr> Crash Override and Acid Burn, I think.
05:20:57 <shapr> something equally cheesy.
05:21:02 <Igloo> exaggerated, pah. Happens to me every Tuesday.
05:21:11 <Aglarion> igloo: ??
05:21:17 <shapr> oh hey, if you get a chance to see the TV series 'Jake 2.0' it's actually really geeky *and* really cool.
05:21:39 <shapr> there's one episode where this guy has to infiltrate a ring of crackers via IRC and then Munich
05:22:17 <Aglarion> but i just had to laugh when they had their filemanagers in 3D and they found a "trash file"... it's just too much
05:22:30 <Aglarion> Jake 2.0 is not on air in .de
05:22:47 <shapr> I once started a channel called #ntcrack on EFNet just for silliness. A coupla people showed up and shared their lists of thousands of credit card numbers and I got rid of the channel.
05:23:02 <Aglarion> lol
05:23:32 <shammahs> shapr: well after all, you had already made your profit on it, so why push your luck ;) 
05:23:36 * shapr laughs
05:24:09 <shapr> I actually told these guys that they should send an anonymous email to the australian banks with open SQL servers and no admin password
05:24:36 <shammahs> ooh nasty.
05:24:49 <shapr> musasabi: I've seen some mailing list posts about that
05:25:16 <shammahs> shapr: nah, tell them to ring it in 'anonymously'.
05:25:22 <shapr> oy
05:25:23 <musasabi> I have a combinator like c :: (Data c, Data b, Data a) => (a -> XDRt) -> (b -> XDRt) -> c -> XDRt
05:25:44 <shammahs> our teleco's are rather scary in their ability to track voice comms when the police turn up with the appropriate paperwork.
05:25:54 <Aglarion> just a dum"p" question: how do i access tupels in haskell?
05:26:09 <shapr> I'm not surprised. There's going to be another golden age in phreaking when SCTP finally becomes standard.
05:26:17 <musasabi> Aglarion: pattern matching.
05:26:17 <Igloo> case x of (_, _, x, _) -> x
05:26:23 <Aglarion> ah.. ok
05:26:59 <shapr> connection switched networks are on their way out
05:27:11 <ozone> huzzah
05:27:14 <ozone> registered for ICFP!
05:27:23 <shapr> yay!
05:27:25 <ozone> now i just have to organise my flights and stuph
05:27:28 <shapr> ozone: where's your IOHCC entry?
05:27:31 <Aglarion> could have guessed it if i had thought about it clearly enough
05:27:32 <musasabi> now I can use it to combine two functions like "boolToXDR `c` intToXDR" (which has type  forall c. (Data c) => c -> XDRt) Now I want to make c work with more than two functions.
05:27:40 <shapr> oh ye of runtime loading and template haskell cluefulness.
05:27:59 <Aglarion> is the IOHCC to haskell as IOCCC to C?
05:28:03 <shapr> yup
05:28:18 <Aglarion> cool... but haskell is obfuscated enough for me at the moment :-)
05:28:37 <shapr> the current contest organizers were inspired by Richard Braakman, who one day here on #haskell "Haskell needs an IOCCC."
05:28:38 <ozone> shapr: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/pretty.html
05:28:52 <Aglarion> BRB
05:28:54 <ozone> except (1) it's not mine, and (2) it's not an entry :)
05:28:54 <shapr> ozone: oh.
05:29:07 <shapr> is dons going to enter that?
05:29:11 <ozone> that's just my de-facto "where's some obsfuscated haskell" link
05:29:16 <ozone> shapr: no idea.  ask him. :)
05:29:19 <shapr> ok
05:29:21 <ozone> but it's pretty!
05:29:23 <shapr> it is
05:29:55 <shapr> hey, is there a scanned XML?
05:30:05 <ozone> a whatwhat?
05:30:24 <shapr> some format that's extremely easy to turn from a scanned page into 'real' info?
05:31:03 <bringert> xerox has a format like that I think
05:31:08 <bringert> uses just / and \ 
05:31:21 <bringert> can't remember what it's called
05:31:26 <shapr> for example, I'd like to find or come up with a format that's something like a barcode, but you can take a picture with your phonecam, and save the info as data
05:32:04 <shapr> like, putting concert info on a poster in this format so that you can just suck the date/time into your phone's datebook.
05:32:31 <shapr> thanks, I'll look into that.
05:35:40 <Aglarion> sounds pretty cool...
05:35:56 <Aglarion> but why not put rfid chips in all posters? :-)
05:36:41 <Aglarion> then with the id transmitted you get the data via gprs or umtl or something
05:36:49 <Aglarion> umts
05:38:45 <Aglarion> btw barcodes should be phonecam compatible, aren't they?
05:38:50 <goron> What does this means? Prelude SomeModule>  every variable is now out of scope. I am working in ghci.
05:39:11 <goron> SomeModule*> Is what I normally get.
05:41:05 <Aglarion> i better leave now. i hope i'll have the time to return later. cya
05:41:47 <shapr> goron: means you have two modules in scope
05:41:57 <shapr> goron: you can do that with :m + System.Random
05:41:59 <shapr> for example
05:44:46 <goron> But the names in SomeModule are *not* in scope now. Is this a bug? 
05:53:00 <shapr> seems like they should be
05:57:04 <musasabi> hmm still problems.
05:57:15 <musasabi> I have a combinator cc :: (Data a, Data b) => (a -> XDRt) -> (b -> XDRt) -> (a -> XDRt)
05:57:46 <musasabi> I can use it with arguments like charToXDR :: Char -> XDRt and anyToXDR :: (Data a) => a -> XDRt
05:58:03 <musasabi> Why is listToXDR :: (Data a) => [a] -> XDRt not valid?
05:58:31 <musasabi> GHC complains "Ambiguous type variable `a' in the top-level constraint: `Data a' arising from use of `cc' at XDR.hs:55"
06:13:03 <musasabi> hmm I think I understand it.
06:13:31 <musasabi> It is because cast is defined for casting values to concrete types and I want to cast to a typeclass.
06:13:39 <musasabi> Is that even possible?
06:13:49 <shapr> I dunno
06:13:59 <shapr> sounds like something that would need a forall or so
06:15:29 <musasabi> the basic problem is that Data.Generics uses casts which means (Typeable a) => a -> Maybe b
06:16:07 <musasabi> and what I want is (Typeable a, Foo b) => a -> Maybe b
06:19:13 <musasabi> I could handle list with ugly Constr equality hack.
06:19:18 <musasabi> lists even
06:19:38 <goron> musasabi: Did you read my proposal on the mailinglist?
06:25:07 <musasabi> goron: no, could you give a link or hint on the subject.
06:26:28 <musasabi> http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell/2004-August/014427.html is the best approach I can find.
06:32:27 <goron> musasabi: http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-August/006687.html
06:36:54 <musasabi> goron: yes, that would be nice (I just went with a combinator instead of list for the main function, but needed lists for the datatype I was targeting which I seem to be able to solve with type classes)
06:37:49 <goron> musasabi: I only don't understand that the idea isn't picked up. It would be trivial to implement, imho.
06:38:22 <musasabi> and very nice to add.
06:38:50 <musasabi> how many times have I wanted to have a list of values for a debug function with the constraint "it can be showed")
06:39:05 <goron> I could put it on the Wiki and wait till the petition is signed...
06:39:09 <musasabi> goron: you could implement that in template haskell afaik
06:39:27 <goron> musasabi: How do you mean? 
06:39:51 <goron> musasabi: *exactly* like I put it in my example?
06:40:55 <musasabi> well the http://www.haskell.org//pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-August/006689.html way.
06:45:05 <goron> musasabi: You still have to provide a _trivial_ datatype for it. So it can be automated...
06:47:28 <goron> musasabi: Do you get the point?
06:48:36 <musasabi> goron: if the point is "this can be done automatically and safely by the compiler and is very usefull" then yes.
06:49:00 <goron> musasabi: Ok, then we agree.

06:52:10 <shapr> ?
06:53:16 * goron back to normal :)
06:53:24 <shapr> :-)
07:09:13 <cptchaos> Does anyone know some kind of preprocessor (fuktionality like the c-preprocessor, but with better multiline Macros), that I could use in my project? 
07:09:23 <earthy> m4?
07:09:40 <earthy> or is that overkill?
07:09:52 <cptchaos> a little bit
07:10:08 <cptchaos> I need #include
07:10:19 <cptchaos> and an #define for multiply line code
07:10:32 <earthy> with that exact syntax?
07:10:53 <cptchaos> no, should be simple, thats all
07:11:01 <earthy> ah, then m4 will fit the bill
07:11:08 <earthy> even though it has much more frills as well
07:11:31 <cptchaos> ok, thanks
07:11:55 * cptchaos is reading m4 docu
07:14:03 <goron> cptchaos: Have you looked at the typical haskell preprocessors?
07:14:27 <cptchaos> goron: what do you mean?
07:16:54 <cptchaos> goron: i thought that ghc may use cpp as preprocessor
07:18:12 <Lemmih> Anyone want a gmail account?
07:18:41 <earthy> nay, have 6 to spare as well
07:19:57 <goron> cptchaos: For example this one: http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/
07:20:20 <goron> cptchaos: But there are more. 
07:23:34 <goron> Lemmih: I want one. 
07:23:59 <cptchaos> goron: thanks
07:29:49 <goron> Are /msg messages in logs?
07:30:21 <cptchaos> goron: in irc?
07:30:24 <goron> yes
07:31:01 <cptchaos> IIRC this is a direct message to someone in irc
07:31:39 <Lor> Ordinary /msg goes through the irc server, but logging is usually done by a client, so it only sees the public messages to the channel.
07:31:43 <shapr> if you've setup your client to log private msgs, then yet
07:31:48 <shapr> but the server doesn't save them usually.
07:31:54 <shapr> right, what Lor said.
07:32:53 <Lor> goron, I take it you mean the public logs that are posted on the web?
07:32:58 <goron> Lor: yes
07:34:18 <musasabi> Is there a way to add a function to an existing type class?
07:35:17 <Lor> If you could do that, what would be the point of type classes?
07:35:35 <Lor> What you can do, on the other hand, is do a new class that inherits the old one, and create a default instance for it.
07:35:58 <Lor> If you use overlapping instances, you can then define specific instances as needed.
07:36:22 <musasabi> so that the type inference algorithm would deduce that all instances of the old class are instances of the new one?
07:36:34 <Lor> So: class Old a where ... class (Old a) => New a where ... instance (Old a) => New a where ...
07:37:07 <Lor> I'm not sure if this is a good idea, though.
07:43:53 <musasabi> but that does not work
07:45:21 <esap> The instance will cause some trouble.
07:45:29 <musasabi> Could not unambiguously deduce (XDR a) from the context (Data a)
07:45:47 <musasabi> Where XDR is class (Data a) => XDR a where
07:46:13 <musasabi> as it cannot make a choice of overlapping instance declarations...
07:50:00 <musasabi> It seems that my failures are consistent with trying to have a case for list of values and the rest of values...
07:50:10 <musasabi> This seems to be too hard...
07:50:33 <esap> what do you mean by "case for list of values"?
07:52:24 <musasabi> I want both a "instance (Data a) => XDR [a] " and "instance (Data a) => XDR a"
07:53:10 <musasabi> I have learned special casing for single types of data, just the "list of something" seems very hard.
07:53:49 <esap> I'd suggest use only concrete things in instance declarations, e.g. you could declare a instance XDR [] where ...  
07:54:52 <stefan_> esap: you cannot ... i.e., if XDR expects a type argument of kind *
07:55:00 <esap> But using instance XDR [a] will likely conflict with any instances that substitute something for 'a'. Similarly for 'instance XDR a', a is so generic that it's likely to overlap with everything.
07:56:00 <stefan_> esap: it certaintly will :)
07:56:11 <musasabi> I think I got one solution...
07:56:12 <esap> stefan_: There is a standard trick to fix that, e.g. define two classes, one for * -> * and another for *.
07:56:31 <musasabi> Use Constr equality and for list length a gmap operation...
07:57:03 <stefan_> esap: that's hardly a trick ... :) ... just wanted to make clear that you could not XDR for both arguments of kind * and arguments of kind * -> *
07:57:05 * shapr grumbles at emacs
07:57:18 * stefan_ loves emacs ... well sometimes ;)
07:57:22 <shapr> semantic bovinator needs help.
07:57:41 <shapr> it claims to have a python parser, but I can't find that, or any docs about that.
08:10:10 <jadrian> hello
08:10:22 <cptchaos> hi
08:10:26 <jadrian> hi cptchaos 
08:10:51 <jadrian> I'm having a little trouble fully understanding the problem with this
08:10:57 <jadrian> -- instance Functor BinTree where
08:10:57 <jadrian> --     fmap f (Leaf a)       = Leaf (f a)
08:10:57 <jadrian> --     fmap f (Node a tl tr) = Node a (fmap f tl) (fmap f tr) 
08:11:04 <jadrian> I know the workaround
08:11:34 <jadrian> define a "mapBinTree :: (a->b) -> BinTree a -> BinTree b" function and do fmap = mapBinTree
08:11:43 <Smerdyakov> How do you know there is a problem with it?
08:12:13 <jadrian> Smerdyakov: because of:
08:12:16 <jadrian> "inferred type is less polymorphic than expected"
08:12:25 <jadrian> "uantified type variable `b' is unified with another quantified type variable `a'"
08:12:34 <jadrian> "When trying to generalise the type inferred for `fmap'"
08:12:49 <Smerdyakov> Try writing in the type for fmap explicitly.
08:12:49 <jadrian> "Signature type:     forall a1 b1. (a1 -> b1) -> BinTree a1 -> BinTree b1"
08:12:56 <stefan_> fmap f (Node a tl tr) = Node (f a) (fmap f tl) (fmap f tr)
08:13:17 <stefan_> you wrote 'a' instead of 'f a'. ;)
08:13:28 <jadrian> opss ues
08:13:29 <jadrian> yes
08:13:40 <jadrian> :)
08:14:11 <jadrian> Smerdyakov: yes I understand that should solve it, because it is about the same as my workaround
08:14:28 <jadrian> Smerdyakov: just wondering why I need that
08:15:50 <Smerdyakov> jadrian, if it prints the inferred type, then it's not needed.
08:18:09 <Boegel> hello people
08:18:14 <Boegel> I found this channel on the net
08:18:27 <Smerdyakov> Good strategy.
08:18:31 <Boegel> and I'm having a problem in Haskell
08:18:41 <Boegel> a weird problem if you ask me
08:18:54 <Boegel> are there people here who can help me?
08:18:56 <stefan_> jadrian: it's not needed.  what you have is just fine, provided that you change the typo I just pointed out
08:19:11 <shapr> Boegel: yes, but we don't know your question.
08:19:13 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, ask a question and find out. Don't paste lots of code, though.
08:19:21 <shapr> hiya SyntaxNinja 
08:19:29 <Boegel> I'll put it on my website, so you can download the code
08:19:33 <shammahs> Certainly the idea of interacting with an irc channel via a book is novel.
08:19:33 <Boegel> it's not big
08:19:38 <shapr> Boegel: there's also a code paste page on the Wiki
08:19:45 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, it would be better if you can _describe_ your problem in English.
08:19:49 <Boegel> wel
08:19:55 <Boegel> I'm using FranTk
08:19:58 <shammahs> otherwise I'm not particularly surprised you've found us 'on the net'
08:20:03 <shapr> ah, cool
08:20:11 <Boegel> that's a graphic library for Haskell
08:20:29 <Boegel> I'm trying out the examples which I found in the user manual
08:20:43 <Boegel> the first one works (it' only 3 lines or so)
08:20:49 <Boegel> but the second one doens't
08:21:19 <Boegel> I have a function that composes two Components into one Component
08:21:29 <Boegel> and I want to use that Component in my GUI
08:21:30 <Boegel> so
08:21:37 <Boegel> I have a main function, like this :
08:21:46 <Boegel> main = display $ withRootWindow [] $ scaleAndButton
08:22:02 <Boegel> and scaleAndButton looks like this:
08:22:03 <Boegel> scaleAndButton = do m <- (newBVar 0) 
08:22:03 <Boegel> 		    composite m
08:22:15 <shapr> do you get an error?
08:22:19 <shapr> how does it not work?
08:22:21 <Boegel> with the type:
08:22:28 <Boegel> scaleAndButton :: Component
08:22:36 <Boegel> Hugs gives an error like so:
08:22:42 <jadrian> opss sorry phone
08:22:48 <Boegel> ERROR "F:/THESIS/GUItest/test2.hs":7 - Type error in final generator
08:22:49 <Boegel> *** Term           : composite m
08:22:49 <Boegel> *** Type           : GUI (WidgetB PW)
08:22:49 <Boegel> *** Does not match : IO a
08:23:08 <jadrian> Smerdyakov: stefan_: yeap you were both right
08:23:10 <Boegel> if I type ':info Component' in Hugs, I get this:
08:23:12 <shapr> what's on line seven?
08:23:27 <Boegel> -- type constructor
08:23:27 <Boegel> type Component = GUI (WidgetB PW)
08:23:27 <jadrian> dumb mistake
08:23:32 <Boegel> so that looks okay
08:23:43 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, do you understand what 'do' does, and its typing rule?
08:23:44 <Boegel> the definition of scaleAndButton is on line 7
08:24:21 <SyntaxNinja> hi shapr
08:24:24 <Boegel> well, do makes sure that (newBVar 0) is put 'into' m, and then composite m is returned as result of the function
08:24:27 <Boegel> I think
08:24:35 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, and what's the typing rule?
08:24:48 <shapr> do you have test2.hs online somewhere we can look at it?
08:24:58 <Boegel> moment, I'll pyt it online
08:25:00 <Smerdyakov> shapr, the problem is clear to me from what he's already said.
08:25:29 <Boegel> Smerdyakov, the typing rule of do ?
08:25:32 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, yes
08:25:33 <Boegel> I don't know it, no
08:25:50 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, do you understand a little about what monads are?
08:26:57 <Boegel> http://www.wina.ugent.be/cursussite/Haskell/test2.hs
08:27:04 <Boegel> err, not really no
08:27:19 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, well, in this case, all you need to know is that GUI and IO are two distinct monads.
08:27:28 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, certain operations are tagged as belonging to a monad.
08:27:30 <Boegel> GUI is an extention of IO, I know that
08:27:47 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, newBVar belongs to IO, and composite beongs to GUI.
08:27:56 <Boegel> uhu,I get it
08:28:00 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, all statements of a do must belong to the same monad.
08:28:07 <Boegel> oh, like that
08:28:19 <Boegel> so the example in the user manual is wrong :)
08:28:50 <Smerdyakov> Could be.
08:28:51 <Boegel> and is there a way I can solve this problem ?
08:28:58 <Boegel> because GUI is an extention of IO
08:29:01 <stefan_>  
08:29:12 <Smerdyakov> If GUI is truly meant tobe used as an "extension" of IO, you should find some function of type IO -> GUI.
08:29:16 <Smerdyakov> er
08:29:21 <Smerdyakov> IO a -> GUI a
08:29:38 <Boegel> http://www.rz.unibw-muenchen.de/~j8sj0499/studies/trimi/frantk/documentation/FranTk.html#_Toc485795797
08:29:44 <Boegel> there's the complete example
08:29:48 <goron> Boegel: GoT?
08:30:07 <Boegel> yes, I'm on GoT to, why ? :)
08:30:41 <goron> Boegel: I saw the resemblance with the topic on GoT and your name.
08:30:52 <Boegel> oh, nice :)
08:31:25 <goron> Boegel: Maar je bent dus nog steeeds aan het ploeteren?
08:31:36 <Boegel> goron: inderdaad :)
08:31:43 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, it looks like there is a better solution in this case. You want the BVar creation to be associated with GUI instead of IO, and I see an alternate function that does that in the manual.
08:32:00 <Boegel> ow, let's see if I can find it to
08:32:01 <goron> Boegel: I wish you success ;)
08:32:39 <Boegel> mkBVar :)
08:33:04 <Boegel> thx Smerdyakov
08:33:06 <Boegel> that works
08:33:07 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, so now apologize to the example for saying it's wrong. ;)
08:33:10 <Boegel> I'm glad I found it
08:33:32 <Boegel> the example IS wrong
08:33:37 <Boegel> it says newBVar
08:33:51 <Boegel> so I won't apoligize :p
08:34:00 <Boegel> thx goron
08:34:29 <Boegel> it's a real shame that a library like FranTk goes to waste
08:34:35 <shapr> yes, I agree.
08:34:58 <shapr> there are a lot of Haskell libraries that could use more maintenance.
08:35:00 <Boegel> I'm getting to know it for a thesis, so maybe I can put an up to date version online
08:35:06 <shapr> that would be cool!
08:35:09 <Boegel> _maybe_
08:35:35 <Boegel> cause I don't have the time to answer all the questions that come along with it (via mail)
08:36:30 <Boegel> again, thank you for the fast help Smerdyakov, I've been looking what's the problem for 2 hours now (besides the other hours I already spent on this simple example)
08:36:39 <Smerdyakov> Any time.
08:36:49 <Boegel> you might see mee again here :)
08:37:10 <Boegel> but I'll look for the solution myself first, because I want to get to know the library
08:37:29 <Smerdyakov> Boegel, where is the incorrect example? It's not at the code at the point you referenced above on the web.
08:37:40 <Boegel> ?
08:37:43 <Boegel> in the html file ?
08:37:49 <Smerdyakov> Yes
08:38:15 <Boegel> I changed to 'do' layout a little bit, that's all
08:38:15 <Smerdyakov> Ah, I see it.
08:38:20 <Boegel> it does say newBVar
08:38:35 <Boegel> so that's pretty weird for a user manual
08:38:48 <Boegel> but the first example didn't work either
08:38:54 <Boegel> that needed a change too
08:39:14 <shapr> what are you doing your thesis on?
08:39:27 <Boegel> I'm writing a ray tracer in Haskell
08:39:30 <shapr> neat
08:39:31 <Boegel> with a simple GUI
08:39:38 <shapr> have you seen VOP by Wolfgang Thaller?
08:39:47 <goron> Vision Of Persistence
08:40:02 <Boegel> but it's not really the ray tracer that is the most important bit, it's the functional programming
08:40:03 <shapr> http://www.kfunigraz.ac.at/imawww/thaller/wolfgang/vop-intro.html
08:40:12 <Boegel> no, I haven't, what is it ?
08:40:14 * goron anticipates
08:41:15 <Boegel> that's pretty cool !
08:41:19 <Boegel> thanx for the link
08:41:23 <shapr> and written in Haskell too
08:41:25 <Boegel> it may help me in the coding
08:41:31 <Boegel> ow, even better :)
08:41:42 <Boegel> but my code needs theoretical support
08:41:53 <Boegel> so it's not only the code
08:42:05 <Boegel> the most important thing is the whole idea behind it
08:42:06 <shapr> right, I understand. VOP might give you something to start with.
08:42:21 <Boegel> true
08:42:49 <Boegel> I'm now trying to understand the basics of ray tracing while writing it in Java
08:42:59 <Boegel> because I know Java pretty good
08:43:02 <Boegel> but it's damn slow
08:43:26 <Boegel> a 50x50 image with 4 sphere's, without lighting needs a few seconds
08:44:28 <goron> Boegel: What kind of "theoretical support" do you think of? There's not much to be discovered in raytracing (only some optimizations maybe to make things faster and a possible hardware implementation). Or is there?
08:45:08 <Boegel> it's not about discovering
08:45:39 <Boegel> I'm doing my thesis under a professor that has developed a functional system to prove things in
08:45:44 <Boegel> it's called 'FunMath'
08:46:02 <goron> Boegel: Ok, so you just build a application X. And then prove X is correct using FunMath?
08:46:19 <Boegel> I should define the functions I'll need in FunMath first, and then convert those to Haskell
08:46:32 <goron> Boegel: It's to prove practical usefulness of FunMath?
08:46:36 <Boegel> that way I can avoid bugs and other errors before writing anycode
08:46:43 <Boegel> yes, that the idea
08:47:05 <Boegel> it already has proved it's usefulness before, in various domains
08:47:09 <shapr> I usually use QuickCheck.
08:47:09 <goron> Boegel: Then I *finally* get what's it about. 
08:47:16 <Boegel> :>
08:47:24 <shapr> but then, I've never tried any code proof tools.
08:47:25 <Boegel> didn't the GoT topic do that already ?
08:47:45 <Boegel> it's not really the code, but what it does
08:47:48 <goron> Boegel: No, that was mostly about FranTK..
08:48:38 <Boegel> for example, prove that when I want to create an image of a metal sphere with the functions I wrote, I will actually get it when i use those functions
08:48:39 <goron> Boegel: Can you prove *anything* with FunMath?
08:48:44 <Boegel> sure :)
08:49:02 <Boegel> hmm, maybe a example will help
08:49:14 <goron> Boegel: Can I use it? Link?
08:49:17 <Boegel> let's see if I can put anything online
08:49:35 <shapr> one advantage of 3D programming is that if it looks right, it is.
08:49:45 <Boegel> well, I don't know if the prof. has put anything online that is complete enough to use it
08:50:03 <goron> What university (I forgot or you never mentioned it)?
08:51:11 <Boegel> http://www.wcc2004.org/congress/tutorials/tut11.htm
08:51:17 <Boegel> UGent
08:51:26 <Boegel> Ghent (Belgium)
08:51:41 <Boegel> but he started his 'project' in Nijmegen (Netherlands)
08:51:59 <shapr> nijmegen has been mentioned here a lot lately.
08:51:59 <Boegel> the link is from a congress where he gave a lecture about the system
08:52:25 <shapr> is FunMath available for download?
08:52:28 <Boegel> I have a pdf that gives lots more information, but I'm not sure if I can give it
08:52:44 <Boegel> it's no programming language or something like that
08:52:48 <Boegel> you're getting it wrong :)
08:52:52 <Boegel> it's like math
08:52:56 <Boegel> but functional
08:53:03 <Boegel> you have to do it on paper
08:53:18 <Boegel> you can't give a piece of Haskell code to it, and try to prove things
08:53:19 <goron> Boegel: Anything you can do on paper, you can automate...
08:53:22 <Boegel> it's not like that
08:53:32 <Boegel> it's more wide than Haskell
08:53:33 <shapr> there is a project to prove a subset of Haskell.
08:53:40 <shapr> Marvin-- did that.
08:53:53 <Boegel> if you want more information, maybe you can mail him
08:54:13 <Boegel> and ask if you can get more information, like an introduction to it (on pdf or so)
08:54:14 <goron> The complexity of proving programs is only quite high (I think).
08:54:20 <Boegel> it is
08:54:34 <goron> Boegel: How high? I don't know.
08:54:50 <Boegel> we had to prove some things about a very simple program with a 'while' loop in it
08:54:50 <goron> But I can imagine it.
08:54:54 <Boegel> that was damn hard
08:55:14 <Boegel> we had to prove that the while loop did what it was intented for
08:55:31 <Boegel> so if that is that hard, you can imagine the complexity for real programs
08:55:43 <Boegel> it's a bit like LongHorn (the new windows)
08:55:58 <Boegel> they are rewriting the whole core of windows, and with proved correctness
08:56:06 <Boegel> atleast, that's what they say :p
08:56:10 <goron> Boegel: That's a new one :)
08:56:21 <Boegel> I've heard that
08:56:25 <shapr> that might take a few decades.
08:56:35 <Boegel> there's a guy in our class who works with Microsoft
08:56:45 <Boegel> so he tells us those things from time to time
08:56:49 * goron don't thing Microsoft will do that. 
08:56:55 <goron> thing->think
08:57:07 <Boegel> he's always playing with the latest release of longhorn to
08:57:13 <Boegel> it's vector-based and stuff
08:57:20 <Boegel> looks pretty good really
08:57:26 <Boegel> amazing animations
08:57:34 <shapr> I prefer using programs I can fix myself.
08:57:48 <Boegel> :)
08:57:58 <Boegel> well, I have to go now
08:58:00 <goron> I prefer programs that don't need fixing, but I can't find one.
08:58:04 <Boegel> but you will see me again here
08:58:08 <shapr> nice to meet you
08:58:26 <Boegel> if some people here need more information about FunMath, mail me and maybe I can help you
08:58:33 <Boegel> kenneth.hoste@ugent.be
08:58:37 <Boegel> no spamming pls :p
08:59:31 <goron> You can come back when there's an implementation :p
08:59:53 <Boegel> that won't be before february or so :)
09:00:05 * goron don't trust himself with proving a program >10 lines...
09:00:14 <arjanb> Boegel: too late the log of this channel is on the internet
09:00:17 <Boegel> but when I experience some problems, I know this is a good place to solve them
09:00:18 <goron> don't->doesn't
09:00:26 <Boegel> I don't have to prove the whole thing, just parts of it
09:00:34 <Boegel> but you'll see
09:00:54 <Boegel> I'll try to make an English version of my thesis, if I have the time
09:01:21 <Boegel> thx for fixing my problem Smerdyakov
09:01:43 <Boegel> bye for now, and 'till later !
09:04:33 <goron> Oh, no he is @ SkyNet (seen Terminator 3?)
09:09:18 * TheHunter gives up trying to convince ghc that forall b. (b -> b) -> (b -> b) can be specialized to (List a -> List a) -> (List a -> List a) for some higher-rank type List
09:11:14 <kosmikus> TheHunter: hide the type in a newtype, then it's easier
09:12:03 <TheHunter> kosmikus: that works, i know. But i wanted to see if i could make ghc accept this somehow
09:12:16 <shapr> hej Marvin-- 
09:13:06 <TheHunter> anyway, all that wrapping/unwrapping is really ugly
09:13:26 <Marvin--> hej hej
09:13:55 <kosmikus> I don't think you can make ghc accept it, but then again, I don't know ... guess I'd have to try
09:14:14 <kosmikus> ghc is at least not supposed to be able to do it
09:15:04 <TheHunter> sometimes it works
09:15:25 <kosmikus> MLF can handle impredicative instantiations of polymorphic types
09:15:54 <TheHunter> as in type Nat = forall c. (c->c) -> (c->c); mult :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat; mult x y f = (x :: (c->c) -> (c->c)) $ y f
09:18:50 <kosmikus> that works by instantiating and regeneralizing, but it does not really instantiate a quantified variable to a polymorphic type
09:20:14 <TheHunter> i see
09:21:10 <TheHunter> thx, kosmikus 
09:25:10 <shapr> shapr: "Don't talk to those who talk to themselves."
09:26:01 * bringert is confused
09:26:11 <shapr> whyso?
09:26:26 <bringert> can you talk to yourself or not?
09:26:46 <bringert> if you don't, you can, but if you do, you can't
09:27:01 <shapr> huh?
09:27:06 <shapr> ah
09:27:06 <shapr> right
09:27:52 <stefan_> Russell :)
09:28:08 <shapr> O'Connor?
09:28:14 <stefan_> lol
09:28:14 * shapr grins
09:31:04 * shapr fixes his webserver
09:31:06 <shapr> yay
09:31:25 <Marvin--> has anybody here used the language "groovy"?
09:31:37 <shapr> man, lots of chinese IP addresses trying random ssh login/password combos on my colo box
09:31:41 <shapr> Marvin--: yah, it's a Java thingy
09:31:48 <shapr> oh, *used it*
09:31:56 <Marvin--> shapr: yeah I know what it is, I'm wondering if it's any cool
09:32:13 <shapr> from what I've heard, it's Java with more nifty bits.
09:32:14 <keverets> shapr: on my boxen, too.
09:32:23 <keverets> (the Chinese IP addresses)
09:32:37 <shapr> makes me wonder if we should start using sshd port-knocking.
09:32:58 <keverets> I considered it... on a couple of the boxes I moved sshd to a non-standard port
09:33:15 <keverets> which was the easiest option.
09:33:20 <Igloo> port-knocking?
09:33:27 <shapr> Igloo: knock twice to enter
09:34:04 <Igloo> If that was supposed to make everything clear then you overestimate my intelligence  :-)
09:34:06 <shapr> http://www.portknocking.org/
09:35:08 <shapr> for example, if my IP address sends a connection request to port 42 and then port 4242, the firewall then allows my IP address to connect to the ssh port
09:35:13 <Igloo> Ah, cute
09:36:02 <shapr> it's transparent to mitm attacks, but gets rid of scanners.
09:36:20 <Marvin--> groovy looks almost like what a "JRuby" would look like
09:36:32 <shapr> what does this mean? "error: Could not get shadow information for NOUSER"
09:36:35 <shapr> that's a worrisome log message.
09:36:40 <Igloo> Pity you need to do root stuff on teh server to make it happen
09:37:14 <shapr> you could use netcat and friends to do it on ports >1024
09:37:16 * stefan_ realizes the TheHunter was struggling with Russell as well ... (no, once again, not O'Connor) ;)
09:38:52 <TheHunter> wdym?
09:39:30 <shapr> Russell's Paradox
09:39:32 <stefan_> TheHunter: Russell's paradox address impredicativity, doesn't it?
09:39:53 <Igloo> Ermmm, can you listen for a connection from a given IP address?
09:40:29 <Igloo> The whole idea has a potential race if 2 people try to connect from machien A to machine B, of course
09:40:50 <TheHunter> stefan_: that was a tough one
09:41:16 <shapr> Igloo: what about opening the firewall to new connections for one minute after a knock?
09:41:59 <shapr> ack, apache is segfaulting
09:42:06 <Igloo> True
09:46:53 <shapr> hi Maddas 
09:48:12 <Maddas> Hey shapr
09:49:14 <Maddas> Replacing more and more of my system with emacs, now TeXShop had to make place for Emacs' AUCTex. I still use TeXShop, but only to compile to PDF, I edit everything in AUCTex.
09:49:30 <Maddas> Makes ERC really handy if you're always in Emacs :-)
09:49:56 <shapr> yes, but that has some downsides
09:50:27 <shapr> makes me wish emacs were multithreaded.
09:50:30 <Maddas> Certainly does. Which do you have in mind?
09:51:01 <Maddas> Oh, that, yes. I'm mostly on freenode, not connecting to other servers fearing the deadlock if the server doesn't respond =)
09:51:44 <Maddas> And some broken TeX function (default mode, not AUCTex) which tried to call a system thingy and failed hung the entire emacs, taking down my IRC client too.
09:52:06 <shapr> yes, that's the primary problem I have with doing stuff in emacs.
09:53:07 <Maddas> Not using Gnus keeps it from being too bad, I guess, and I didn't have a hanging emacs before today for a few months :-)
09:53:15 <Riastradh> Emacs is all elisp, too.  Yuck.
09:53:55 <musasabi> How can I make a type more general that is from Foo which derives Data to Data?
09:53:59 <shapr> I use Gnus, I love gnus.
09:54:08 <Maddas> Indeed, a language with facilities better suited to the tasks would be nicer. I don't like elisp either, just emacs.
09:54:08 <shapr> musasabi: huh?
09:54:36 <Maddas> shapr: I'm afraid that will happen to me too someday ;-)
09:54:37 <musasabi> I want to define "myc :: (Data a) => String -> a"
09:54:49 <musasabi> myc = id
09:54:53 <musasabi> but that does not work.
09:55:34 * shapr grumbles at his webserver
09:55:40 <Riastradh> musasabi, how do you expect it to work?
09:56:44 <musasabi> Riastradh: well since String fullfils the dependency it should just change the type the compiler sees.
09:58:10 <Riastradh> id maps values of type t to values of type t.  You can't unify that with (Data a) => String -> a, because String & a are different, even if there is a [Char] instance in Data.
10:00:10 <musasabi> well I started from newtype MyString = S String and tried to define:
10:00:18 <musasabi> tr a = maybe a S (cast a)
10:00:49 <musasabi> and now make that work with a type of (Data a, Data b) => a -> b
10:03:20 <Maddas> shapr: Surprisingly, having IRC built-in to the editor makes me waste not more but less time, since I don't always have to change windows (applications) and check whether anybody said anything, it's displayed right there in the statusbar.
10:16:33 <Boegel> hello, I'm back :p
10:17:27 <musasabi> hmm now I can create an isString predicate for arbitary Data...
10:20:33 <Riastradh> Emacs bothers me to some extent.  It's just not _quite_ good enough to operate as the entirety of my environment, but OS X, which does operate well enough, doesn't integrate with things as well as Emacs does.
10:22:37 <musasabi> isString s = maybe False (\(_ :: String) -> True) (cast s)
10:22:52 <musasabi> wonder why I didn't see that hours ago
10:23:34 <Maddas> Riastradh: I have similar feelings.
10:24:15 <Maddas> What currently annoys me most is that I can't read formatted PDFs in Emacs.
10:24:18 <Riastradh> OS X is _very_ slick in many areas, but it's still Unix, nowhere _near_ an integrated Lisp environment.
10:24:37 <Maddas> ("Formatted" as in "displayed the way it's supposed to be", not just coloured source.)
10:25:49 <Riastradh> All this is _totally_ relevant to Haskell, of course!
10:26:19 <Boegel> why would you use Emacs to view a PDF file ?
10:26:59 <Maddas> So I can have it fullscreen and just view the PDF in one and what I'm writing in another buffer, instead of having two windows :-)
10:27:00 <musasabi> Now how would I generalize that to lists?
10:27:06 <Riastradh> Integration, Boegel.
10:27:28 <Maddas> Yeah. Which is also why I use Emacs to chat in IRC :-)
10:27:29 <Boegel> emacs isn't meant to view pdf's, or am I wrong ?
10:27:56 <Boegel> neither is it meant to chat in IRC :p
10:27:59 <Riastradh> What do you mean by 'isn't meant to?'
10:28:07 <Boegel> well, it's an editor
10:28:11 <Boegel> not a pdf viewer
10:28:13 <musasabi> wishfulThinking l = maybe (-1) (\l -> length l) (cast l)
10:28:14 <Riastradh> No, it's a Lisp environment.
10:28:18 <Maddas> Well, the authors probably didn't have it in mind when they created emacs. But it was designed to be extensible, and it can view images anyway :-)
10:28:23 <Riastradh> With significant facilities for editing.
10:28:24 <stepcut> if emacs had better pdf/ps and web browser, it would be by entire desktop
10:28:37 <musasabi> and now *why* does that not work... and how to fix it.
10:28:49 <bringert> if emacs had a kitchen sink, it would be an apartment
10:28:53 <Boegel> :)
10:29:01 <Boegel> I only use it as an editor
10:29:04 <Boegel> for programming
10:29:14 <Boegel> because of the syntax highlighting
10:29:22 <Maddas> That's a fine use too.
10:29:37 <stepcut> the biggest problem I have with emacs is it doesn't have good threading
10:29:59 <Riastradh> Boegel, 'for programming' is a very large area.
10:30:04 <stepcut> but I still use it for IM, IRC, and email
10:30:06 <Boegel> where can I get the file for syntax highlighting Haskell in Emacs ?
10:30:11 <Riastradh> You just edit source code with Emacs?
10:30:17 <Boegel> jep
10:30:20 <Boegel> that's it
10:30:27 <Maddas> I think that's one of the large problems with it in general. But I feel bad because musasabi actually has a Haskell-related problem and I'm just diverting attention from that...
10:30:38 <Boegel> I figure other programs do the rest I want to do better
10:30:39 <Riastradh> You don't run REPLs from Emacs, Boegel?
10:30:51 <Boegel> REPLs ?
10:31:08 <Riastradh> Interactive evaluators.  (Read-Eval-Print-Loops)
10:31:40 <Boegel> no, because I don't know what that is :p
10:31:53 <Boegel> I'm not a developer, I'm a student, if that matters
10:32:02 <Riastradh> Also known somewhat misleadingly as 'interactive interpreters.'
10:32:30 <Lor> Or "toplevel prompts".
10:33:39 <Boegel> what does it do then ?
10:34:34 <Lor> Do you use hugs?
10:34:40 <Boegel> es
10:34:42 <Boegel> yes
10:34:46 <Lor> Well, it's a REPL.
10:34:48 <Boegel> sometimes Hugs, sometimes GHC
10:34:54 <Boegel> but mostly hugs
10:34:55 <Lor> You give it expressions, it gives back the result.
10:35:02 <Boegel> oh, like that
10:35:18 <Boegel> so why use Emacs if you have Hugs ...
10:36:20 <Riastradh> You can run Hugs _in_ Emacs and more conveniently use it.
10:36:59 <Boegel> how more conveniently ?
10:37:18 <Boegel> I don't mind switching between windows, using Alt+Tab
10:37:27 <Riastradh> First of all, you get all of Emacs's editing facilities in the Hugs buffer.
10:39:25 <Boegel> I think I can work faster when I seperate editing and 'running' between Emacs and Hugs
10:40:38 <shapr> lambdabot: @quit
10:41:06 <shapr> something bad happening on my colo box
10:41:20 <Boegel> colo?
10:41:24 <Riastradh> OK, Haskell isn't a very good example here.  It would be better if you observed SLIME, for example.
10:41:25 <shapr> all processes that end become defunct, but don't go away
10:41:46 <shapr> Boegel: colocated, it's at my ISP connected to a 10MBit line
10:43:30 <Boegel> I don't know SLIME
10:43:36 <musasabi> Anyone want to help me with my generics problem - or provide pointers where to look for solutions?
10:44:47 <Boegel> I'm not good enough in Haskell to help you musasabi, otherwise I would try it
10:44:49 * shapr reboots and prays
10:44:58 <musasabi> basically I want "wishfulThinking l = maybe (-1) (\x -> length x) (cast l)" but that is not possible bacause casting to a polyumorphic type is not possible.
10:45:09 <Riastradh> Boegel, it's the Superior Lisp  Interaction Mode for Emacs; see <http://www.cliki.net/Slime>.
10:47:36 <shapr> crap, it won't reboot either.
10:47:51 <Boegel> hacked, shapr ?
10:47:56 <shapr> I don't think so.
10:48:01 <shapr> I think something just broke.
10:48:15 <Boegel> so you'll have to go over there?
10:48:19 <shapr> I hope not
10:48:25 <shapr> it won't be open till tomorrow
10:48:41 <stefan_> musasabi: are you using the boilerplate stuff?
10:49:06 <Boegel> and what does that mean for you ? why is it a problem ?
10:49:35 <shapr> my company's website and a bunch of other stuff are on that box
10:49:58 <shapr> like, the DarcsWiki, a bunch of darcs repos, the IOHCC mailing list, and a list of other things
10:50:29 <Boegel> nice :s
10:50:56 <shapr> I wish I knew what's causing this problem.
10:51:06 <Boegel> your processes hang ?
10:51:08 <Boegel> or what N
10:51:09 <Boegel> ?
10:51:25 <shapr> I dunno, everything that exits stays defunct
10:51:31 <musasabi> stefan_: yes.
10:51:46 <shapr> can't shutdown the broken apache, can't reboot, this is really weird.
10:51:50 <shapr> oh, lambdabot is on that box too.
10:52:06 <Boegel> I don't know all those things, but that doesn't matter
10:52:07 <stefan_> musasabi: let me digest ... what's your problem exactly?
10:52:09 <Boegel> which OS ?
10:52:19 <shapr> it's running Debian Linux, the unstable flavor.
10:52:47 <Boegel> unstable.. doesn't that say enough ?
10:53:03 <Boegel> or shouldn't that cause problems?
10:53:04 <shapr> unstable usually means 'works fine if you're careful'
10:53:07 <shapr> not usually.
10:53:23 <Boegel> maybe you weren't carefull enough :p
10:53:49 <musasabi> stefan_: I want to differentiate list values from the rest of values.
10:54:12 <shapr> that's possible
10:54:56 <musasabi> stefan_: basically if x is_a_list then foo else bar. Doing if x is_a_list_of_x the foo else bar is trivial for me, but the polymorphic case remains elusive.
10:54:57 <Boegel> it's not a virus or so ?
10:55:12 <shapr> I don't think so. I ran chkrootkit, and didn't find anything.
10:55:15 <Boegel> cause normally, if something is broke, your whole machine would crash, wouldn't it ?
10:55:30 <shapr> plus, if the box were cracked, it would usually still work, and any evidence would be hidden.
10:56:01 <Boegel> that's true
10:56:05 <Boegel> but a virus would do that
10:56:22 <Boegel> a virus would just cause problems, without hiding traces
10:56:53 <shapr> I'm not aware of any linux viruses.
10:57:05 <Boegel> neither am I, but you never know :)
10:57:30 * stefan_ thinks ...
10:58:13 * shapr tries 'init 6'
10:58:42 <musasabi> btw someone was looking at modelling SMTP session in haskell - http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~neubauer/papers/padl04.pdf
10:58:50 <shapr> oh oh me!
10:59:36 <shapr> wtf? "init: timeout opening/writing control channel /dev/initctl"
11:00:00 <Boegel> maybe a problem with the connection ?
11:00:11 <shapr> no, the connection is fine
11:00:40 <stefan_> musasabi: mmm ... I see the problem ... but I don't really have a solution, I'm afraid
11:14:10 <Boegel> I'm leaving guys, c u later
11:14:18 <Lunar^> musasabi: Thanks _a lot_ !
11:16:37 <musasabi> Lunar^: ?
11:17:40 <musasabi> Constr equality seems quite "fun": 'toConstr ([] :: [Char]) == toConstr False ' is True...
11:18:14 <Lunar^> musasabi: I'm thinking about mail things these days
11:18:45 <stefan_> musasabi: I've wrote something that seems to do the trick ... but it's quite ugly ... it by-passes cast and uses unsafeCoerce ... in a type-safe way though ...
11:19:05 <stefan_> musasabi: shall I send it by e-mail?
11:19:39 <musasabi> stefan_: sounds good (ekarttun at cs helsinki fi).
11:21:59 <stefan_> musasabi: sent
11:22:48 <musasabi> thanks.
11:22:54 <goron> sepBy (char 'a') spaces;spaces "a a " gives me a parse error in Parsec. Why?
11:23:36 <goron> The first part is the parser, and I all the types work out. 
11:23:49 <stefan_> goron: because of the trailing space
11:23:58 <goron> stefan_: But why is that wrong?
11:24:15 <goron> stefan_: I already noticed that it worked without the space.
11:24:31 <stefan_> goron: that space does not actually _seperate_ two a's ;)
11:25:07 <goron> That's true, but if sepBy just stopped consuming input and then applied spaces, then it would be parseble.
11:26:04 <goron> I want to express: first some a's separated by spaces followed by a space.
11:26:30 <goron> I thought Parsec was a backtracking parser.
11:27:36 <stefan_> goron: it is only backtracking if you indicate so explictly 
11:28:23 <goron> stefan_: How? try?
11:28:27 <stefan_> goron: lambdabot's not here :( ... look for 'try' in the Parsec libs
11:28:33 <stefan_> goron: yes
11:28:55 <goron> stefan_: Ok
11:29:08 <stefan_> musasabi: scaring stuff?
11:35:24 <musasabi> stefan_: yes, quite scary, I am starting to understand it slowly....
11:36:33 <musasabi> stefan_: with adding -f-allow-{undecidable,overlapping}-instances I get to define a default type which makes the code work on all types of data.
11:37:50 <stefan_> musasabi: now you're making it even more scaring ;)
11:39:29 <stefan_> musasabi: it has a very strong taste of "trust me, I know what I'm doing" w.r.t. the type checker
11:43:39 <musasabi> that is fine as long as it is kept caged inside a single module...
11:43:54 <stefan_> musasabi: could not agree more
11:54:48 <Si\> has ne1 got any better ideas regarding my extensible XML serializer problem (http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell@haskell.org/msg15180.html)?
12:03:59 <musasabi> stefan_: that had a bug in it - instance Typeable () where typeof *()* = Type "Unit" []
12:04:11 <musasabi> that () is wrong. It must be _.
12:05:10 <musasabi> Otherwise using undefined will throw an exception when (undefined :: ()) is matched against (() :: ())
12:05:14 <stefan_> musasabi: yeah, I realised shortly after I sent it to you ... now it works with bottom too ...
12:05:49 <goron> stefan_: It's nice to find out that spaces _skips_ spaces instead of binds them...AAARGG..
12:06:33 <stefan_> I hacked up a little module that does not use any of the boilerplate stuff anymore and exports a single function 'list' that performs the dispatching
12:06:47 <stefan_> goron: use char ' ' instead
12:07:09 <goron> stefan_: Yes, already done that...
12:07:40 <stefan_> goron: why are you skipping all the fun and don't you write your own high-performance parser combinator library? :)
12:08:42 <goron> stefan_: Well, I am doing something much more fun...
12:08:56 <stefan_> goron: wanna share it with us?
12:08:59 <goron> no
12:09:11 <goron> sorry
12:11:45 <stefan_> :) fair enough
12:12:25 <Maddas> He wants to keep all the fun for himself, bah! :-)
12:13:45 <Boegel> when I was here this afternoon, someone said that Nijmegen was a topic here the last few days (weeks?)
12:13:50 <Boegel> can someone tell me why ?
12:15:06 <goron> Clean, I believe.
12:15:31 <Boegel> what about it ?
12:15:31 <goron> Uniqueness types versus Monads (classical discussion)
12:15:40 <Boegel> have they developed it ?
12:15:55 <goron> yes
12:16:14 <Boegel> doesn't that have a GUI toolkit too ?
12:16:22 <goron> Yes, and imo it sucks...
12:16:30 <Boegel> :)
12:16:31 <Boegel> why?
12:16:41 <musasabi> uniqueness types are good for many things...
12:16:48 <goron> Try it out and you can see for yourself :)
12:17:05 <goron> Have some "fun"...
12:17:15 <goron> Maddas: ;)
12:17:16 <Boegel> I'm having problems enough with FranTk, thank you very mutch :p
12:20:17 * goron just conquered his parsing problem..Moehahaha :)
12:21:59 <Boegel> goron, does VOP include a SDL parser ?
12:22:56 <goron> Boegel: Don't know. I only looked @ the sourcecode a year ago when I was following a Graphics course. 
12:23:16 <goron> Boegel: It has a Povray parser.
12:23:25 <Boegel> I think it does, because it can 'read' *.pov files
12:23:38 <Boegel> SDL is the Scene Description Language of PovRay
12:23:47 <Boegel> so probably it will have a parser
12:23:52 <goron> Ok, I thought it was something else..
12:24:08 <Boegel> I'm not sure either
12:24:13 <Boegel> but I think it's the same
12:24:15 <goron> Well, if it can read it(which it can), it certainly must have a parser.
12:24:50 * goron thought you meant:Simple DirectMedia Layer
12:25:13 <goron> SDL is a popular acronym.
12:25:31 <Riastradh> 'Simple DirectMedia Layer' _ought_ to be SDML.
12:25:35 <Boegel> apparently :)
12:25:49 <Boegel> while searching information about it, I also noticed
12:26:04 <goron> Yes, but I think the letter M is just too much work for most people.
12:27:02 <Boegel> I think the SDL (PovRay) parser is in Grammar.lhs
12:28:10 <Boegel> what's the difference between *.hs and *.lhs anyway ?
12:29:04 <Igloo> l means literate
12:29:19 <goron> Anyone using Kate here? I am having trivial problems...
12:29:20 <Igloo> code starts with ">" or is surrounded by \begin{code} and \end{code}
12:29:29 <Boegel> ow
12:29:36 <Boegel> so you can put comment in between ?
12:29:53 <goron> yes
12:29:57 <Igloo> I would say documentation rather than comment, but yes
12:30:25 <Boegel> yeah, that's what I mean :p
12:30:57 <goron> Already "fixed" it. No idea of how I came in that "state".
12:31:05 <Igloo> Sorry, didn't mean to offend if it was a language thing, but they mean quite different things to me
12:31:23 <Boegel> no, it's not a language thing
12:31:28 <Boegel> well
12:31:32 <Boegel> maybe it is :p
12:31:39 <Igloo> Well, I didn't mean to offend if it wasn't a language thing either  :-)
12:31:43 <Boegel> ;)
12:31:46 <Boegel> none taken
12:32:19 <Boegel> okay, I'll try to figure out the 3rd example in the FranTk manual, and try to fix it
12:32:28 <Boegel> and then I'll give it a go on my own GUI
12:32:33 <goron> It is a language thing, according to the mathematical definition. 
12:32:40 * Boegel lights a candle
12:32:53 <Igloo> Why FranTk OOI?
12:33:07 <Boegel> because I was recommended FranTk
12:33:17 <Boegel> do you have a better idea ? suggestions are welcome
12:33:47 <Igloo> Well, I'd go for wxhaskell or one of the GTK bindings if I wanted a nice UI. I don't know if FranTk is nicer to write the code for, though, as I've never used it
12:33:49 <Marvin--> I'm a gtk fan so I like to suggest gtk2hs :)
12:34:17 <goron> Marvin--: Since when :? lol
12:34:25 <Boegel> a nice GUI is not the most important thing
12:34:42 <Boegel> it has to be functional, or at least as good as possible
12:35:02 <goron> Boegel: wxHaskell is as functional as FrankTK, imo.
12:35:06 <Igloo> nice is a mixture of visually appealing and functional
12:35:09 <Boegel> I suggested wxHaskell, but was said that FranTk was a better choice
12:35:19 <Marvin--> goron: since when what? since when am I a gtk fan or since when am I recommending gtk2hs?
12:35:29 <goron> Marvin--: The latter...
12:35:41 <Marvin--> goron: well, since I started using it, I suppose
12:35:41 <Boegel> wxHaskell is less functional than FranTk
12:35:48 <Boegel> nicer code in FranTk
12:36:03 <Igloo> Oh, wait, we're using different definitions of functional
12:36:05 <Boegel> is the syntax functional, Marvin-- ?
12:36:10 <Igloo> I meant it in the "usable" sense
12:36:17 <goron> Boegel: Everything that's possible and that you need is present in both probably.
12:36:21 <Igloo> Sorry  :-)
12:36:21 <Boegel> I meant syntax-wise
12:36:32 <Igloo> Fair enough, like I said, I've never used FranTk
12:36:45 <Boegel> neither have I, except for the 2 examples
12:36:53 <Boegel> which I had to rewrite to get them working :s
12:37:05 <goron> Boegel: imo you only need some placeholder for your renderings and show them.
12:37:12 <Marvin--> Boegel: I don't know what you're looking for so it's hard to say. I very rarely write guis in code anyway, since I can use glade
12:37:14 <Boegel> yes I know
12:37:24 <Boegel> but I would like to make it a bit more interactive
12:37:44 <Boegel> allowing minor settings, such as resolution and recursion depth
12:37:46 * Igloo has never gotten around to glade. Maybe I should some time.
12:38:10 <Boegel> what is glade ?
12:38:21 <Boegel> wysiwyg kinda thing ?
12:38:55 <Marvin--> yeah, you point 'n click to design the gui, and it's saved as an xml file that you can read in at runtime
12:39:42 <Boegel> as xml ?
12:39:56 <Boegel> how do you get your GUI then ?
12:39:57 <Marvin--> button <- xmlGetWidget xml castToButton "button1" ; button `onClicked` putStrLn "Hello world!"
12:40:16 <Marvin--> libglade has a function that reads the xml file and creates all the widgets
12:40:19 <Marvin--> and you can look them up by name
12:40:48 <Boegel> hm, that's not what i'm looking for I guess
12:41:07 <Boegel> I have to be able to use it in a functional 'environment'
12:41:42 <Marvin--> well, of course there's an api for creating and manipulating widgets too
12:42:03 <Marvin--> but I don't know what you mean with a functional environment
12:42:12 <Marvin--> you could look at fudgets, I suppose
12:42:34 <Marvin--> but to me, it's more important that the gui is good than that the code satisfies some inner urge for functional purity
12:43:23 <Boegel> well, the problem with me is (you probably don't know this yet), is that my GUI is to be used for a thesis
12:44:24 <Boegel> I'm writing a ray tracer with simple GUI in Haskell, and some parts have to be supported in a functional 'system' to prove certain functionalities
12:44:45 <Marvin--> that doesn't tell me much ;)
12:45:25 <Boegel> I supposed to write the functions I need for my ray tracer on paper first, in a functional language called FunMath
12:45:33 <Boegel> and then parse them to Haskell
12:45:35 <musasabi> How can I tell GHC that type unification is just what I want?
12:45:54 <Igloo> I doubt that is meant to include GUI stuff
12:45:56 <Boegel> so my GUI has to be in functional syntax to, in order to be able to do that
12:46:05 <Igloo> musasabi: huh?
12:46:07 <musasabi> "Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected \n Quantified type variable `a' is unified with another quantified type variable `c'" 
12:46:17 <musasabi> well I *want* a to be equal to c.
12:46:33 <Boegel> well, it doesn't have to include GUI stuff
12:46:34 <Igloo> I think we'd have to see the code...
12:46:45 <musasabi> This comes from an instance declaration to a typeclass.
12:46:51 <Boegel> but my promotor would like to see what I can find out about GUI's and functional programming
12:47:18 <Boegel> I have to go
12:47:19 <Marvin--> then I suppose you should have a look at fudgets
12:47:21 <Boegel> sorry guys
12:47:27 <Marvin--> personally, I find them horrible though
12:47:40 <shapr> maybe porting fudgets to Yampa?
12:47:49 <Boegel> I'll be back later, but I have to go now
12:47:54 <Boegel> I'll keep fudgets in mind
12:47:55 <Boegel> baai !
12:47:57 * Igloo smiles at shapr
12:48:21 <musasabi> Igloo: well the relevant bit is:
12:48:22 <musasabi> class TClassify a where ap   :: (TClassify c) => (Int -> b) -> ([c] -> b) -> (a -> b) -> a -> b
12:48:26 <musasabi> instance (TClassify a) => TClassify [a] where ap _ f _  = f
12:49:06 <musasabi> now GHC sees that "aha in this instance declaration a == c" but that is exactly what is wanted.
12:49:45 <Igloo> OK, the class says that if I give it arguments with types (Int -> b), ([c] -> b) and (a -> b) then I can use the result with type a -> b
12:50:00 <musasabi> yes.
12:50:06 <Igloo> But if c = Char and a = Int then I cannot do this with your instance
12:50:11 <Marvin--> for *any* c
12:50:21 <Marvin--> that's significant
12:50:35 <Igloo> The user gets to choose c and a, not you
12:50:37 <Marvin--> (well, any c s.t. TClassify c)
12:51:42 <musasabi> Marvin--: and we use the last parameter as a catch all case when the user suplies something nasty e.g. (\_ -> "some default value") (if b :: String)
12:52:27 <musasabi> as we have "instance TClassify a where ap _ _ f = f"
12:54:25 <Si\> Marvin--: have you had any more thoughts on my extensible XML serializer?
12:54:56 <Marvin--> Si\: can't say I have :)
12:56:07 <Si\> Someone got it to work with the dual parameter type-class and undecidable instances, but that method leads to humongous contexts for each data-type instances that requires recursive serialization
12:56:17 <Marvin--> yeah, I saw the mail
12:57:09 <Si\> I'm just not sure if Haskell is even capable of this
12:58:00 <Marvin--> that makes two of us
12:58:33 <Marvin--> I've been fiddling with XPath in python all day
12:59:13 <Si\> which is highly annoying because it means that the type-class system can only be used for basically monolithic type structures
13:03:18 <goron> somefunc :: forall (t :: ??). t -> IO () Why are those ?? are there?
13:04:22 <goron>  \s\are\ 
13:08:28 <kosmikus> Igloo: is Heffalump absent, or just not on irc atm?
13:09:09 <Igloo> Just not on IRC
13:10:07 <stefan_> musasabi: did you already solve your TClassify problem?
13:10:48 <stefan_> musasabi: changing the type of ap does the trick
13:10:50 <stefan_> ap :: (Int -> a) -> (forall b . (TClassify b) => [b] -> a) -> (t -> a) -> t -> a
13:10:57 <kosmikus> Igloo: thanks
13:11:20 <Igloo> Marvin--: What did you decide about -dev packages and Debian deps BTW?
13:11:43 * Igloo got around to looking at the readline (build)deps on ghc6 and found I have the same issues there  :-/
13:12:00 <kosmikus> what issues?
13:13:34 <Igloo> kosmikus: If you build a Haskell library with libfoo2-dev version v, what should the library depend on to guarantee it ends up being linked with something satisfactory
13:13:46 <Igloo> Where libfoo is a C library
13:14:22 <kosmikus> ok, what are the options, and what are you doing currently?
13:14:28 <Marvin--> Igloo: I decided to use that script I wrote that calls dpkg-shlibdeps, I don't think it generates too tight dependencies
13:14:30 <musasabi> stefan_: thanks, again.
13:15:23 <Marvin--> kosmikus: I wrote this script: http://people.debian.org/~sjogren/haskell/mk-haskell-deps
13:15:30 <stefan_> musasabi: do you understand why the type should be higher-ranked here?
13:15:43 <Igloo> Doesn't dpkg-shlibdeps give you deps on libfoo2, not libfoo2-dev? Or is that what's needed?
13:16:15 <Marvin--> you need to add the -dev dependencies manually, but they are typically similar to the build-deps anyway
13:16:16 * Igloo wonders if the ghc6 dep on libreadline4-dev is entirely unnecessary
13:16:40 <Igloo> Ah, right, I wasn't confused then  :-)
13:17:13 <Igloo> Oh, but they don't need versioning due to the dependence of the -dev on teh exact libfoo2 version?
13:17:55 <Marvin--> they don't need versioning because the shlibs system will give you versioned deps on libfoo
13:18:34 <Igloo> OK, now I remember how that works, but I'm going to need to do nasty things given a build-dep of "libreadline4-dev | libreadline-dev" to get the right -dev dep
13:19:15 <Marvin--> hmm... :/
13:20:42 <musasabi> stefan_: I think I do, but I don't have a good understanding of higher rank types. Kind of knwo when they are needed, but can't speak about them in sound mathematic terms.
13:21:43 <Igloo> I can probably assume there's only one thing providing libreadline-dev as they ought to all conflict with libreadline-dev
13:21:46 <stefan_> musasabi: just think of polymorphic functions beings passed as function arguments
13:22:39 <Marvin--> Igloo: for this particular case, yes, but some libraries do allow simultaneous installs of libfooX-dev and libfooY-dev even if it's unusual
13:23:13 <Igloo> Oh, ick
13:23:45 <Marvin--> but if all libreadlineX-dev provide libreadline-dev, the libreadlineY dependency will force the correct libreadlineX-dev
13:24:02 <Marvin--> (that is, if you depend on ${shlibs:Depends}, libreadline-dev)
13:24:17 <Igloo> Err, I don't think that's true
13:24:36 <Igloo> I'm sure you can have libreadline3, libreadline3-dev, libreadline4 installed
13:24:52 <Marvin--> hmmm... true
13:25:08 <Marvin--> not that libreadline3-dev is around any longer
13:25:28 * Igloo waves a paw dismissively
13:26:11 <Marvin--> maybe d-devlibdeps can help
13:26:15 <Igloo> I can't spot a simple way to find the list of packages providing a virtual package anyway
13:27:15 <Marvin--> I just compiled an empty (as in, main = return ()) program with -package readline and ran dpkg-shlibdeps and d-devlibdeps on it and got the following substvars file:
13:27:23 <Marvin--> shlibs:Depends=libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4), libgmp3, libreadline4 (>= 4.3-1)
13:27:24 <Marvin--> devlibs:Depends=,libc6-dev,libgmp3-dev,libncurses5-dev,libreadline4-dev
13:28:47 <Igloo> Ah, cool
13:30:09 <Marvin--> unfortunately, d-devlibdeps sucks
13:30:43 <Igloo> Oh?
13:30:57 <Marvin--> all it does is look at what libraries a program is linked with and tries to guess a package name and see if that package exists
13:31:03 <Igloo> !
13:31:33 * Igloo wonders where libncurses5-dev came from
13:32:09 <Marvin--> probably from a.out being linked with libncurses5 ;)
13:32:42 <Marvin--> libreadline is linked with libncurses
13:32:52 <Igloo> Ah, that's OK then
13:32:59 <Marvin--> ... which is kinda funny because libreadline is in /lib and libncurses is in /usr/lib...
13:33:21 <Marvin--> er, no, actually libncurses is in both /lib and /usr/lib for some dumb reason
13:34:07 <Marvin--> anyway, d-devlibdeps is slightly smarter than that and tries to resolve provides and stuff too, and it maintains a list of overrides, but that's basically it
13:35:01 <Marvin--> for my gtk2 packages I get lots and lots of misses :)
13:35:12 <Marvin--> devlibs error: There is no package matching [libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0-dev] and noone provides it, please report bug to d-shlibs maintainer
13:35:13 <Marvin--> devlibs error: There is no package matching [libgdk-x11-2.0-0-dev] and noone provides it, please report bug to d-shlibs maintainer
13:35:15 <Marvin--> (and so on)
13:36:47 <Igloo> Actually, just depending on everything that provides it would be reasonable I think. In the cases where multiple can be installed we can think harder if it comes up
13:38:52 <Marvin--> luckily I don't have any alternative depends in gtk2hs
13:57:55 <musasabi> Why is "class (Data a) => Bar a where bar :: a -> Baz" not enough to make it possible to use bar inside a gmapQ ?
13:59:59 <Smerdyakov> Is gmapQ a standard function?
14:00:39 <Boegel> Prelude> :info gmapQ
14:00:39 <Boegel> Unknown reference `gmapQ'
14:00:39 <Boegel> Prelude> :type gmapQ
14:00:39 <Boegel> ERROR - Undefined variable "gmapQ"
14:00:44 <Boegel> I think not
14:00:51 <Boegel> (in Hugs)
14:00:53 <stefan_> Shardyakov, Boegel: gmapQ comes from the boilerplate approach to generic programming
14:01:04 <Marvin--> it's in Data.Generics
14:01:09 <Marvin--> @type Data.Generics.gmapQ
14:01:18 <Marvin--> oh wait, lambdabot isn't here
14:02:51 <Boegel> what is lambdabot ? (this is all new to me)
14:03:03 <Marvin--> oh it's an irc bot we have here
14:03:08 <stefan_> musasabi: what do you mean by 'using inside gmapQ'?
14:03:12 <musasabi> Boegel: a bot which can lookup things from haskell sources.
14:03:23 <Boegel> nice
14:03:35 <Boegel> you guys are well organised here :p
14:04:44 <musasabi> stefan_: like 'gmapQ enc any' with 'enc :: (Bar a) => a -> Baz' and any a Data.
14:08:13 <musasabi> clearly it should be possible as Bar is defined for all Data a. (that is (Data a) implies (Bar a) and thus makes enc a valid) 
14:10:34 <Boegel> just being curious: which country are u guys from ?
14:10:42 <Boegel> u -> you (sorry, habit)
14:11:19 <musasabi> Boegel: do a /who ;)
14:12:44 * stefan_ is from The Netherlands
14:14:05 * Marvin-- is from Sweden
14:14:17 * musasabi is from Finland
14:14:33 * kosmikus is from .de, but lives in .nl
14:15:06 * Riastradh is unfortunately an American.
14:15:33 <Marvin--> Riastradh: aw, it's okay, we like you despite that
14:15:40 <kosmikus> why unfortunately?
14:15:44 * jesse99 is fortunately an american
14:16:51 <Boegel> because Bush is too, kosmikus :o)
14:17:11 <stefan_> musasabi: I can't reproduce your problems :S
14:17:17 <Boegel> jesse99, who will you vote for ?
14:17:28 <jesse99> bush
14:17:32 <Boegel> ow, and why ?
14:17:45 <jesse99> because kerry is a weather-vane
14:17:54 <Boegel> meaning ?
14:18:06 <jesse99> and he's been on the wrong side of nearly every foreign policy question of the last 30 years
14:18:14 <stefan_> musasabi: I've foo :: [Baz] ; foo = enc `gmapQ` any
14:18:28 <Boegel> so you think Bush did a good job the last few years ?
14:18:41 <jesse99> he adopts positions because it's expedient,  not because he believes them
14:18:49 * arjanb thinks politics shouldn't be a topic of this channel
14:18:49 <jesse99> mixed Boegel
14:19:06 <Boegel> how do you mean mixed
14:19:25 * Boegel thinks that a open, polite discussion has never harmed anyone
14:19:32 <Boegel> *an* open
14:19:34 <Smerdyakov> arjanb, oh, you big whiner.
14:19:46 * vidvandre is from Norway
14:19:52 <jesse99> a lot of his economic and social policies suck, his iraq venture was a big-time gamble that may or may not pay off
14:20:03 <Boegel> pretty european down here, or am I mistaking ,
14:20:14 <musasabi> stefan_: did you make enc use the parameter depending on a?
14:20:16 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, you're a registered Democrat, aren't you? :)
14:20:17 <Boegel> you still think it might pay off ?
14:20:18 <Riastradh> jesse99, of course it will pay off: they stole all the oil they wanted.
14:20:20 <kosmikus> Boegel: while I agree with arjanb, I also think that a single person should not cause a native citizen of a country to judge his nationality as "unfortunate"
14:20:22 <jesse99> but i'd much rather have bush facing off against AQ than kerry
14:20:54 <jesse99> yeah, i think there's a fair chance iraq will turn out to be a decent place (for the ME), sort of like jordan
14:21:02 <musasabi> stefan_: as the choice of the (overlapping) instance instantination depends on the type of a.
14:21:13 <Boegel> kosmikus, I think it's not only Bush that makes Riastradh say he is unfortunately American
14:21:20 <stefan_> musasabi: I've enc :: (Data a) => a -> Baz ; enc = undefined
14:21:35 <jesse99> the media of course present a heavily skewed view of the situation, they'll leap to report any bad news, but most good news flies under their radar
14:21:59 <Boegel> he catched Saddam
14:22:02 <Boegel> that was good news
14:22:32 <Boegel> but he helped cause the train terror actions in Spain (without Bush, that never would have happened)
14:23:00 <eshu> without water, no one would drown
14:23:09 <musasabi> I have my code in http://youzen.b2.fi/~musasabi/t.hs
14:23:15 <jesse99> so if I off your niece you'll be my poodle Boegel?
14:23:21 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, you're saying that you think invading a country unprovoked is sometimes justified?
14:23:40 <kosmikus> Boegel: hey, that's unfair to blame Bush for the Spain actions
14:23:52 <Boegel> I don't understand that jesse99, pls rephrase
14:23:56 <jesse99> it wasnt unprovoked, saddam had been in flagrant violation of the first war
14:24:03 <jesse99> s cease fire for years and years
14:24:15 <Riastradh> If it 'pays off,' of course, Smerdyakov!  After all, we _need_ more oil than anyone else in the world, so stealing it randomly is fine.
14:24:34 <kosmikus> the main mistake was to suggest that there was a connection with 9/11
14:24:42 <Riastradh> jesse99, yes, and in the preceding months he had opened up Iraq and let the weapons inspectors look to see...nothing.
14:24:58 <Riastradh> kosmikus, that wasn't a mistake.  That was very deliberately planned; it worked out perfectly for the Republicans.
14:25:04 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, and you think the American government has some kind of moral authority that allows it to take over the country, due to the actions of a small elite of its population?
14:25:06 <kosmikus> for a time
14:25:09 <jesse99> if I kill your niece or sister, you'll take care not to offend me and do what I say?
14:25:50 <jesse99> he hardly opened up his country to inspectors, they were never given a free hand
14:25:58 <musasabi> jesse99: I don't go off to kill your family in return ;)
14:26:06 <jesse99> half of europe went into iraq with the US Smerdyakov
14:26:15 <kosmikus> Riastradh: I mean, sure, it was planned, but that's in my eyes the real mistake. If he would have said he wanted to invade Iraq because of personal and economical reasons, I might at least have believed him.
14:26:17 <Marvin--> we did?
14:26:34 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, you know as well as I that national boundaries don't mean much, and that these decisions are made by an international elite. So pretend my question was about this elite.
14:26:49 <Boegel> yes, because they wanted to 'help', only because they were afraid of the US
14:27:02 <musasabi> There is probably too little polymorphism somewhere...
14:27:03 <kosmikus> jesse99: the UK is the only European country that showed serious commitment
14:27:20 <jesse99> was it right to to start a war in the balkans to prevent genocide? would it be right to go to war with the sudan? these are not questions that have easy answers
14:27:30 <Riastradh> kosmikus, yes, but he doesn't care about people like you.  He cares about the people who are going to believe whatever is shoved down their throats in television.
14:27:53 <stefan_> musasabi: gmapQ expects as it first argument a term of the form (Data a) => ...
14:27:53 <stefan_> musasabi: however, you pass it enc, which has a type of the form (Data a, TClassify a) => ...
14:27:53 <stefan_> musasabi: so, enc is too restrictive to be passed to gmapQ
14:28:06 <jesse99> but to stick your head in the sand and say that its never right to invade another country that is "only" fouly mistreating is own people makes me uncomfortable
14:28:21 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, I think they have pretty easy answers to me. The right action for Americans, for example, is to stop tyrrany at home before venturing to do the same abroad. This makes the later stage much more efficient.
14:28:31 <Boegel> never right to invade _without reason_
14:28:54 <stefan_> musasabi: i.e., unless Data is a subclass of TClassify ... which it is not in your code ... rather TClassify is a subclass of Data, which is not enough to make this work
14:28:55 <Boegel> Bush had no reason
14:28:58 <jesse99> would it have been right to invade hitlers germany, pol pot's regime?
14:29:17 <Marvin--> Boegel: 'course he did, daddy fought Saddam, he wanted to do it too ;-)
14:29:21 <Boegel> weapons of mass descruction was a wrong reason, because there weren't any
14:29:23 <jesse99> tyranny in the US? what have you been smoking Smerdyakov?
14:29:23 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, the critical fact you miss is that this is not a clear-cut situation. It's not a sports match. What you see about what's going on in the world is custom chosen to distract you from other issues. Time you spend worrying about foreign issues is time not spent repairing your broken society.
14:29:52 <Riastradh> jesse99, Hitler's Germany had occupied half of Europe, demonstrated itself to be _relevant_ in major world politics, and was threatening a vast quantity of the world.  Iraq was threatening...uh...
14:30:04 <Riastradh> Itself?
14:30:11 * Boegel agress with Smerdyakov
14:30:14 <musasabi> stefan_: but there is no way to subclass existing classes?
14:30:16 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, sure. Do you know how many people spend over 1/4 of their time doing what they are told, without knowing why, just to "make a living" and survive?
14:30:16 <jesse99> like I said it's not an easy question to answer Smerdyakov, but relying on international law to solve problems is *not* going to work in all cases unless someone backs it up with a credible use of force
14:30:19 <Boegel> *agrees*
14:30:41 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, I don't really believe in special moral rights of nations or "international law," so that's not what I'm saying at all.
14:30:44 * jesse99 fails to see the point of your comment Smerdyakov
14:30:56 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, wage slavery is tyrrany.
14:30:58 <musasabi> stefan_: and making enc :: (Data a) => a -> String, just adds an error 
14:31:15 <jesse99> and how does it relate to what we're discussing?
14:31:21 <eshu> genocide is way less important than 'wage slavery' after all
14:31:33 <jesse99> oh i see
14:31:34 <musasabi> "Could not unambiguously deduce (TClassify a) \n  from the context (Data a) \n arising from use of `ap' at t.hs:33"
14:31:36 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, wage slavery is something that makes more sense to combat _first_, before looking abroad.
14:31:53 <jesse99> poor sheep are locked into their dismal sweat shop factories
14:32:02 <Boegel> Bush should make sure that America is good to live in, before starting attacking country's where he thinks it's not good to live in
14:32:08 <stefan_> musasabi: yes, it causes an error because you use ap :: (TClassify a) => ... inside the def of enc ...
14:32:15 <Boegel> social security for example
14:32:21 <Boegel> that would be a good start
14:32:24 <jesse99> yes yes, we'll fix every problem in the US and *then* we'll try to help the poor bastards being slaughtered in their 10s of thousands
14:32:50 <stefan_> musasabi: I'm afraid you have to go and back a few steps en redesign your code ... I'm sorry
14:33:02 <Boegel> there are a lot more country's where there is slaughter
14:33:12 <Boegel> look at Rwanda and Congo, there at it again
14:33:14 * musasabi goes back to where he started some 15 hours before.
14:33:16 <Boegel> nobody invades them
14:33:34 <jesse99> yeah, but how many of them have pursued WMD, invaded two other countries, and been in continuous violation of a ceasre-fire agreement?
14:33:37 <Boegel> they try to solve it, not attack those country's
14:33:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, that is exactly what I'm advocating.
14:33:44 <kosmikus> Boegel: who are we to tell the Americans who to elect? don't you think they can judge the situation *in their own country* better than we can?
14:33:55 <stefan_> musasabi: do not forget to get some sleep ... it helps
14:33:55 <Riastradh> jesse99, here, if you like those argument tactics, let me rephrase that another way but equally sillily: yes, yes, we'll go invade another country by deceiving our citizens with a vastly biased and rich bastard-controlled media just to increase our quantity of oil, which we always need more of!
14:34:17 <musasabi> stefan_: thanks, I'll try.
14:34:30 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, the world population is much better served by a gradual approach that achieves long-term successes than quick forays into isolated foreign situations that leave the main problems ignored.
14:34:35 <Boegel> that's true kosmikus, but the Americans decide what will happen in Iraq
14:34:45 <jesse99> every intelligence agency in the world believed that saddam had WMD so I fail to see how bush and blair were "lieing"
14:34:54 <Riastradh> kosmikus, in the current situation, ah, no.
14:34:54 <kosmikus> Boegel: if that only were true ...
14:34:55 <Boegel> because an American president is a BIG world leader, so it matters to us too
14:35:06 <jesse99> and the US media has more vareity than it has ever had
14:35:07 <stefan_> kosmikus: I agree with you there ... but ironically have to mention that Bush applied that same reasoning on the Iraq situation
14:35:36 <Riastradh> Every intelligence agency in the _world_?  That's _rather_ overblowing it, jesse99.
14:35:39 <kosmikus> stefan_: not sure I can follow you
14:35:42 <Boegel> kosmikus, you're saying an american president isn't a world leader ?
14:35:57 <Riastradh> Especially given that...no one _actually_found_ much.
14:35:58 <kosmikus> Boegel: only if we make him
14:35:58 <jesse99> well the us, britain, france, and germany for sure
14:36:12 <musasabi> jesse99: if you noticed only western intelligence agencies seemed to think so...
14:36:17 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, why should what these intelligence agencies say be taken to have any relation to fact?
14:36:27 <jesse99> i'm sure if you worked, you could find an intelligence agency that got it right -)
14:36:36 <TheHunter> jesse99: i remember that differently
14:36:44 <stefan_> kosmikus: you said the Americans are to judge the situation in their own country ... Bush did not apply that reasoning on Iraq ... I know, it is not a fair comparison ... not fair by far
14:36:44 <Boegel> if he decides to attack a country with which he has NOTHING to do with, without reason, and taking European country's in it with him, that makes him a world leader
14:36:49 <musasabi> jesse99: and do you think that the western intelligence agencies shared their sources with each other?
14:36:52 <jesse99> because if they believed it, it's asinine to call bush and blair a liar for saying it
14:36:54 <Boegel> we didn't make him a world leader, he did
14:37:07 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, why do you think that they believed it?
14:37:09 <jesse99> that doesnt happen as often as you would think musasabi
14:37:13 <Marvin--> I was under the impression that the us military agencies were... shall we say, encouraged... to interpret findings in a way that suggested WMDs
14:37:21 <kosmikus> stefan_: no, right, he did not -- you said he did in your first message, that's why I got confused.
14:37:47 <jesse99> yes that wsa the FUD being spread Marvin--, but the recent bi-partisan commision found no evidence of it 9rather the conrrary)
14:37:48 <musasabi> jesse99: the intelligence agencies said things more like "there might be WMD in iraq"
14:37:48 <stefan_> kosmikus: oops ...
14:37:51 <kosmikus> stefan_: but Bush's failure to do something doesn't give me the right to patronize the Americans
14:38:13 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, why do you think a "bi-partisan" commision is more likely to be honest than otherwise?
14:38:13 <musasabi> hmm there might be wmd in most countries of the world...
14:38:31 <Boegel> I started something here :o)
14:38:46 <jesse99> because a bi-partisan commision has memebrs that have an interest in pointing out anything that reflects badly upon bush
14:38:52 <Boegel> musasabi, so let's attack all of those, mmmokay ? :p
14:38:58 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, but not things that reflect badly on their _class_.
14:39:04 <stefan_> kosmikus: you're right ... indeed, if you do think it was failure from his part, then you *can't* patronize the Americans because, in a way, you would be doing the same thing as you regard failure
14:39:08 <Marvin--> well, the US has plenty of WMDs, but I guess that's all right, because they're the *good guys*
14:39:10 <Riastradh> Boegel, no, not the ones that give strategic advantages to the Republicans!
14:39:12 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, all the members of these commissions belong to the same elite social class, and have the same goals.
14:45:38 <jesse99> politicians dont form a 'class" in the us Smerdyakov :-) certainly not a monolithic one
14:45:38 <musasabi> Boegel: I have a strong suspicion that the US has WMDs - maybe Bush should start with bonbing it ;)
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, that's right. They are a subset of the class of wealthy people who control the society.
14:45:38 <Boegel> maybe Europe should start bombing the US :o
14:45:38 <eshu> someones got to have them, i guess we could give them to canada for safe keeping :P
14:45:38 <Marvin--> WMD, eh
14:45:38 <jesse99> the US is hardly controlled by the weathy, the middle class and old people have a lot more influence
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, ridiculous statement.
14:45:38 <Riastradh> Haha.
14:45:38 <musasabi> jesse99: middle class is easily manipulated.
14:45:38 * Boegel agress with Smerdyakov again.
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, check out this book: http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/underground/index.htm
14:45:38 <jesse99> and the rich aren't?
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, our current social system is almost entirely designed by Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford, basically; so argues the book, in more or less words.
14:45:38 <Riastradh> jesse99, the middle class is controlled for the most part by a media owned completely by the rich upper class.
14:45:38 <jesse99> the media speak with a thousand voices, especially today with FOX news, talk radio, and the internet
14:45:38 <Riastradh> Hahahaha.
14:45:38 <kosmikus> stefan_: exactly
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, clearly what media are _available_ doesn't matter. What matters is what the average person is exposed to, without outside prompting to lead him to learn of alternatives.
14:45:38 * Boegel is wishing he could stop what he started...
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, that wipes "Internet" off your list.
14:45:38 <stefan_> Boegel: I don't think you make up for a good and open discussion if you suggest bombing the US
14:45:38 <jesse99> the blather about monopolies controlling the media are completely ahistorical, go back 30 or 40 years when there were only three networks controlling most of the news people got, now that was a lack of diversity
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, you take 40 years as the boundary of history?
14:45:38 <Marvin--> Boegel: do what I'm going to do, and hit the sack :)
14:45:38 <jesse99> no Smerdyakov, i'm pointing out that blatering about media monopolies is ignoring very recent history (and overall trends towards more diversity of opinion)
14:45:38 <Boegel> stefan_, that was a joke, irony
14:45:38 * eshu says its a conspiracy, everyone grab your aluminum foil brain protectors
14:45:38 <Boegel> Marvin--, I think I should
14:45:38 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, so when the concentration camp leaders shift towards allowing you to choose what kind of gruel you will be served, we should stop analyzing the inherent properties of concentration camps?
14:45:38 <stefan_> Boegel: I understand, but still ... 
14:45:38 * Boegel notices eshu has seen the movie Signs :)
14:45:38 <Boegel> stefan_, even in serious discussions a joke is in place
14:45:38 <Marvin--> ooh, that reminds me, I should go see The Village
14:45:38 <Boegel> it keeps things friendly
14:45:39 <Boegel> same here
14:45:39 <jesse99> i'm sorry Smerdyakov, was an argument buried beneath that crather crazed remark?
14:45:51 <jesse99> s/crather/rather
14:46:07 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, yes. The situation where people get their information through relatively few centrally controlled sources is inherently bad.
14:46:11 <stefan_> Boegel: nothing wrong with a joke
14:46:14 <kosmikus> Marvin--: yes, me too
14:46:17 <Boegel> I think The Village will be a killer movie again
14:46:19 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, if some of the sources become more diverse, the situation remains bad.
14:46:27 * stefan_ calls it a day
14:46:28 <Boegel> like The Sixth Sense and Signs
14:46:34 <stefan_> bye all
14:46:38 <kosmikus> Boegel: Signs was bad
14:46:40 <Marvin--> I haven't seen Signs
14:46:50 <Marvin--> I really liked Unbreakable though
14:46:56 <Riastradh> _Signs_ was miserably bad.  Don't waste your time with it.
14:46:57 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, watching television is itself is bad. Any setup where people watch enough television to primarily determine their worldviews is abd.
14:47:02 <kosmikus> Marvin--: yes, me too :)
14:47:02 <Boegel> kosmikus: OMG ! Signs was great
14:47:17 <Boegel> it's all suggestive, but damn, it rocked me off my seat
14:47:25 <jesse99> open your eyes Smerdyakov, there are *many more* news channels/shows on TV now, and there's an entirely new medium in the internet with a million voices, in other words there are more not fewer sources of info
14:47:34 <kosmikus> Boegel: well, we disagree here -- I really found it disappointing how little depth it had compared to the other two
14:47:45 <Riastradh> jesse99, yes, but that doesn't mean those sources of information are _used_.
14:47:52 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, open your eyes to what I just said and tell me how _conventional_environments_ for Americans growing up lead them to consider any of these news sources.
14:48:06 <Boegel> imagine what it would be like if we really had e.t. visitors --> Signs !
14:48:06 <Riastradh> The primary method of obtaining news in America is by sitting on a couch in front of a colourful box.
14:48:13 <Boegel> that was captured amazingly
14:48:29 <jesse99> of course they are used, internet use is still rocketing upward, and the traditional news shows are steadily losing market shared to the newcomers
14:48:35 <musasabi> jesse99: Internet is not yet significant for news distribution.
14:48:49 <jesse99> yes, but the trends are that way musasabi
14:48:56 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, Internet use is different from Internet use to receive news from fundamentally new sources.
14:49:46 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, for instance, do you really think our society is set up to point a significant fraction of Americans to any news sources that will consistently question the appropriateness of wage slavery?
14:49:51 <Riastradh> More than 50% of all internet traffic today is Kazaa, jesse99, according to a rather significant fellow at Akamai.
14:49:56 <jesse99> just what are you saying Smerdyakov? that the sizeable increase in the number of shows and the radical innovation of the internet mean we are getting *less* diversity in our news?
14:50:22 <kosmikus> jesse99: at least not necessariliy more
14:50:24 <Smerdyakov> No. I'm saying that the amount of diversity is pretty much the same.
14:50:35 <Smerdyakov> All the important issues are pretty uniform across widely visible sources.
14:50:52 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, now, can you answer my question about news sources and wage slavery?
14:50:56 <kosmikus> but that's not a US phenomenon
14:50:58 <jesse99> wage slavery isnt seen as a problem in the US Smerdyakov (aside from some nutjobs here and there)
14:51:07 <Riastradh> jesse99, if you have a neighbourhood of people with properties X & Y, none with A, B, C, D, etc., and you get more people with properties X & Y, do you get more diverse?
14:51:16 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, OK, so we agree. You won't find the media questioning this social policy.
14:51:28 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, this shows extreme uniformity in the media.
14:51:34 <jesse99> maybe maybe not Riastradh, but will you get less as Smerdyakov seems to be thinking?
14:51:47 <Riastradh> Smerdyakov did not say that you get less.
14:51:49 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, when did I say _less_?
14:51:57 <jesse99> the media doesnt worry about space aliens giving people anal probes either Smerdyakov
14:52:01 <Riastradh> I quote him _exactly_:  'I'm saying that the amount of diversity is pretty much the same.'
14:52:07 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, I said that the "increase in media sources" is a case of _misdirection_; little changes.
14:52:33 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, give http://www.anarchismfaq.org/ a try and then see if you lump those two together.
14:52:42 <Boegel> let's ask another nice question: if you hear on the news, that aliens have landed on earth, what would you do ?
14:52:42 <Riastradh> Sure, even if you get one or two people with properties A & B, the neighbourhood isn't diverse when the majority have only properties X & Y.
14:52:47 <Smerdyakov> (Not to mention the large amount of evidence that alien abduction is a serious phenonmeon)
14:53:07 <jesse99> ok fine, if the media is spewing the same drivel why are media "monopolies" such a problem? especially with internet news looming on the horizon?
14:53:38 <Riastradh> Because such monopolies tend to be the source whence the 'news' originally comes.
14:53:50 <musasabi> Here we have pretty media conscious people with continuously compare Finnish news agencies with foreign ones...
14:54:04 <jesse99> but accoring to Smerdyakov *nothing* has changed, so why the fevor about the evil monoplists?
14:54:29 <Riastradh> Because the source of the news _hasn't_ changed, jesse99.
14:54:34 <Smerdyakov> I tell ya, books like "The Underground History of American Education" and "A People's History of the United States" reveal so many things that are just _buried_ for the mass population, as a result of centralized planning of media.
14:55:33 <Smerdyakov> The most agregious thing I've come across recently is the huge role eugenics has played in the United States, with the Nazi party essentially taking its complete philosophy and platform from established movements in the USA containing almost all people in power.
14:56:11 <musasabi> for example the Iraq situation is a lot more diverse when one follows local news, Russian, English, Al-Jazeera and occasionaly even US ones.
14:56:17 <jesse99> well unless you're way way out of the main-stream I dont see how you can say that the amount of diversity in US media has been declining, fox news is the #1 counter-example imo
14:56:32 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, declining compared to 300 years ago.
14:56:34 <jesse99> err, by declining I mean staying constant
14:57:16 <jesse99> there wasnt much media 300 years ago Smerdyakov, certainly not outside the elite
14:57:26 <Smerdyakov> Right, and so people were much better informed.
14:57:40 <jesse99> yeah, bout sally and tod in the village :-)
14:57:43 <jesse99> about
14:57:56 <Marvin--> well, I'm off to bed
14:58:13 <Smerdyakov> People were much more able to see when others were trying to take advantage of them, and then to fight against it.
14:58:57 <jesse99> jesus h christ Smerdyakov, thats why nobles were able to mercilessly exploit them eh?
14:59:03 <eshu> yes, right, like the roman catholic church, they were the good guys
14:59:08 <Smerdyakov> Not in the USA.
14:59:11 <jesse99> or why some serfs were little better than slaves?
14:59:41 <Boegel> I'm going to bed too
14:59:46 <Boegel> sleep tight every body
14:59:53 <jesse99> or hell, in that period there were bona fide slaves all over the world
14:59:59 <Smerdyakov> The USA has a long tradition of resisting centralized control.
15:00:03 <Boegel> and I hope you guys will have a different subject tomorrow
15:00:16 <jesse99> you say that like it's a bad thing Smerdyakov :-)
15:00:24 <Smerdyakov> No, I'm saying it as a good thing.
15:00:51 * jesse99 is shocked, shocked at agreeing with Smerdyakov on something
15:01:12 <Smerdyakov> Centralized control is the essence of modern American society.
15:01:13 <jesse99> btw thanks to whoever posted that anarchist link
15:01:17 <Riastradh> jesse99, then how could you possibly want to vote for the centralized Bush cabal?
15:01:17 <Smerdyakov> That was I.
15:01:49 <jesse99> because, like reagan, a lot of the criticisms of bush are pathetically over-inflated
15:01:57 <jesse99> well, thank you then
15:02:24 <Riastradh> Yes, but that's because Bush is a pathetically over-inflated puppet, and that's why I said 'the centralized Bush cabal,' not 'Bush.'
15:02:26 <jesse99> i'll take reagan and thatcher over most politicians any day of the week :-)
15:02:40 <jesse99> there is no centralized bush cabal
15:02:41 <Smerdyakov> The idea of most people working for a relatively few large companies is centralized control.
15:02:48 <Smerdyakov> No Democrat or Republican ever opposes this.
15:03:02 <jesse99> most people dont work for a few large companies in the us Smerdyakov
15:03:04 <Smerdyakov> No media outlet that Americans are likely to consider opposes this.
15:03:27 <Smerdyakov> My idea of "relatively few" is such that they _do_.
15:04:45 <musasabi> One thing might be a different view to violence. Many europeans shun violence and do not think that someone being a bad guy gives the right to be violent. Connect this to murder-rates and the eagerness to go to war...
15:05:39 <jesse99> hmm, maybe you're right Smerdyakov "Large employers account for half of the workforce"
15:05:54 <jesse99> source: http://prorev.com/2004/06/workplace-indicators.htm
15:06:34 * Smerdyakov bows.
15:07:16 <jesse99> would like to find a less partisan source though
15:07:50 <Smerdyakov> You probably consider any source that disagrees with you on fundamental issues, like the appropriateness of wage slavery, as "partisan."
15:08:36 <jesse99> no, but a website that labels itself as "progessive" probably has an agenda
15:08:46 <jesse99> i feel the same way about right-wing sites
15:09:02 <Smerdyakov> What is the alternative?
15:09:28 <jesse99> for example, i'd guess that page isnt lieing but they may be using a pretty lame definition of "large company"
15:09:30 <musasabi> all sites have an agenda...
15:09:52 <Smerdyakov> Everyone brings a pre-determined viewpoint to any situation.
15:10:17 <Smerdyakov> By "nonpartisan," you in effect mean "agrees with my idea of the default view," which in turn means "agrees with me on the main issues."
15:10:23 <jesse99> yes, but govt agencies usually have solid numbers for raw data and respected news services usually wont completely slant statistics
15:10:37 <Smerdyakov> Government agencies are far from reliable sources of information.
15:10:41 <Smerdyakov> They're run by people, too.
15:10:41 <musasabi> jesse99: no, they just choose which statistics to pick up.
15:11:18 <Riastradh> jesse99, their definition of 'large employer' is pretty clearly given.
15:11:22 <jesse99> the choose which statistics to hilite, but they generally dont completely omit relevant statistics if you dig a bit
15:11:35 <musasabi> jesse99: sorry but I have done software performance analyses... And from the same data I could claim scientifically that A is better than B and that B is better than A.
15:11:54 <Smerdyakov> jesse99, so you always read a description of their survey and analysis methodology and audit it for misleading choices?
15:12:16 <jesse99> that's why I said *raw data* musasabi, the interpretation of such data is often plotically slanted
15:12:34 <Smerdyakov> The collection of the data is almost always "slanted," too.
15:12:53 <Smerdyakov> Especially in demographic issues.
15:12:57 <musasabi> jesse99: so if agency X does a survey and then interprets it and sends it to the news agencies is it "fair" ?
15:13:25 <jesse99> so you think employment figures are what? some artifitial number plucked out of the air?
15:13:57 <musasabi> jesse99: at least here the employment figures of different agencies vary significantly.
15:13:59 <jesse99> i answerd that already musasabi, govt agencies fairly often slant their interpretations of their data
15:14:20 <jesse99> but the data itself is usually fairly solid
15:14:55 <musasabi> jesse99: "national statistic's instititute" and ministry of labour haven't gotten a single matching statistic in the last ten years ;) (this is in Finland)
15:15:10 <jesse99> the EPA is a good example: they maintain good records of most poluution indicators but their press releases are often biased
15:15:14 <Riastradh> 'There are lies, damn lies, etc.'
15:15:36 <musasabi> of course "ministry of wealth" (the ministry distributing money to other ministries) has it's own views on the issue too...

15:49:21 <cptchaos> @index sepBy
15:52:48 <cm> Hi! I have a problem. Is it possible to define a "class Foo a" with a method of type: "f :: Bar b => a->b" ?
15:54:42 <stepcut> cm, yes and no, the (Bar b) constraint will need to be added to the class Foo a
15:54:54 <stepcut> (Bar b) => class Foo a b, or something
15:55:55 <cm> stepcut: Thanks! I give it a try
16:01:30 <cm> stepcut: Then I have to use multi-parameter classes. Is this to become a standard?
16:05:52 <Riastradh> cm, what, isn't the standard -fglasglow-exts?
16:06:32 <cm> Riastradh: That worked
16:07:03 <cm> It is still a bit tricky. Any examples of multi-parameter classes?
16:19:05 <kuz> How busy.
16:19:20 <kuz> Ah yes, U.S. politics.
16:19:24 <kuz> Hmm.
16:19:44 <kuz> A nice hunk of charred dead cow is in order.
16:20:12 * musasabi wonders why gods are evil..
16:20:57 <musasabi> Boilerplate papers have working code for the list case - only it is not trivially translatable to the Generics implementation that GHC uses.
16:21:06 <musasabi> which seems to just lack the things needed...
16:21:45 * musasabi fetches cvs GHC
16:22:18 * roconnor wishes I could make a Num class for modular arithmetic for every n.
16:23:18 <roconnor> The thing is that I could make a record with all the operations: plus, times, exp, etc.
16:31:19 <kuz> Oooh.
16:31:24 <kuz> Xah Lee.
16:52:04 <cm> How do I interpret "a->b" in "class Foo a b | a -> b where ...". I have ambiguity without that...
16:52:54 <Pseudonym> Have you done any relational database kind of work?
16:53:27 <Pseudonym> @wiki FunDeps
16:53:43 <Pseudonym> Oh, lambdabot isn't here.
16:53:46 <Pseudonym> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/FunDeps
16:53:50 <Pseudonym> That might help.
16:56:16 <cm> Pseudonym: Thanks! No relational databases, functions and classes for molecular biology. 
16:56:51 <Pseudonym> Understood. :-)
19:28:04 <musasabi> hmm my gcc is triggering an ICE when building ghc.
19:28:16 <Gahhh> what is an ice ?
19:28:30 <musasabi> /tmp/ghc61955.lpp:0: internal compiler error: Abort trap
19:28:49 <Gahhh> yay bug reoprt time
19:30:25 <musasabi> Gahhh: yes the gcc folks will be thrilled when I concat the entire thing...
19:30:39 <Gahhh> you're just trying to be helpful.
19:30:46 <Gahhh> diskspace is cheap nowadays
19:35:59 <musasabi> how do I tell ghc not to delete intermediate files?
19:36:19 <musasabi> I cannot specify -C and stop there because that would break the make-system
19:37:39 <Gahhh> can you produce an assembly output ?
19:43:18 <musasabi> it ICEs in the preprocessor stage.
19:43:57 <Gahhh> well, why dont you just attach the offending source file then ?
19:44:02 <Gahhh> I dunno if they allow that
19:44:45 <musasabi> well one has to traverse includes...
19:45:02 <Gahhh> there's a switch for that I think
19:45:04 <Gahhh> could be -H
19:45:17 <Gahhh> it prints out the list of included files
19:45:26 <Gahhh> gah that adds up to megabytes but oh well
19:47:31 <musasabi> Running it through cpp to get the includes makes the ICE go away...
19:47:56 <Gahhh> unusual
19:48:24 <musasabi> it could be some play of -traditional which ghc adds...
19:48:56 <Gahhh> I am still a noob playing with hugs. how fast is the stuff that ghc compiles ?
19:49:22 <Riastradh> Fast enough.
19:49:32 <musasabi> Gahhh: very very fast.
19:49:41 <Gahhh> compared to java ?
19:49:54 <Riastradh> Fast enough to beat corresponding hand-written C in tight OpenGL code.
19:50:05 <Riastradh> Is that fast enough for you?
19:50:14 <Gahhh> that would be but that is pretty bold
19:51:06 <Gahhh> I'd be happy with near java performance.
19:51:09 <Riastradh> (of course, it's worth noting that the Haskell code looked like C in the first place, but still!)
19:51:23 <Gahhh> oh it's mostly monadic ?
19:51:46 <Riastradh> Completely IO-monadic, low-level, and imperative.
19:52:01 <Gahhh> well, that's good to know
20:06:07 <kuz> What example are you referring to?
23:06:01 <stefan_> good morning, #haskell
23:07:20 <Riastradh> Good night, #haskell!
23:12:36 <Pseudonym> Good afternoon... oh, forget it.
23:16:11 <Gahhh> hmm python mode for emacs supports pdb
23:17:33 <stefan_> Riastrdh, Pseudonym: all my greetings should always be substituted by the appropriate timezone-dependent versions ;)
23:18:21 <Pseudonym> Good [locale-appropriate greeting], #haskell!
23:18:57 <Gahhh> well you guys are bored
23:20:46 <stefan_> Pseudonym: I just did not think it was approprate for me in a channel on a pure language to emit expressions that depend on state so much ... perhaps \timeofday -> "Good " ++ show timeofday ++ ", #haskell!" ... :)
23:21:06 <Gahhh> that does it
23:21:30 <stefan_> Pseudonym: now you can drag it into the IO monad yourself
23:29:13 <Lor> I'm not quite comfortable with ++ being the common idiom for string formatting.
23:29:54 <Lor> Then again, I'm not quite comfortable with strings being represented as lists, so there.
23:30:38 <Pseudonym> Actually, you could handle locales using that typeclass constraint mechanism thingy.
23:30:49 <Pseudonym> "Implicit configuration"
