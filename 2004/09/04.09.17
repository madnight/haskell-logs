07:13:10 <shapr> Igloo: HA
07:26:41 <dustin`> I'm looking for ph.d programs with a focus in computer science theory, logic, and mathematical foundations.  Thus far, I've found Berkeley, CMU, and Penn St.  I was wondering if anyone here knew of institutions to add to this list (especially ones that might be more tractable than  Berkeley or CMU) ?
07:30:10 <earthy> Radboud University Nijmegen
07:30:26 <earthy> is one of *the* premier centers in the world for exactly that stuff
07:30:37 <earthy> but you'd have to move .nl :)
07:31:55 <earthy> see e.g. http://www.cs.kun.nl/fnds/
07:33:12 <Igloo> You could probably find something in Oxford too
07:34:08 * earthy nods
07:34:56 <earthy> lessee, itu.dk has a reasonably strong group these days
07:37:39 <dustin`> Hmmm, will Radboud mind if I don't speak a word of any other language besides english, because I am a stupid American? =)
07:37:48 <earthy> INRIA, ofcourse
07:37:58 <xkb> dustin`, no we wont :P
07:38:03 <earthy> dustin`: for a PhD, no. there. ;)
07:38:11 <xkb> there is lots of foreign people here
07:38:16 <xkb> polish, french
07:38:21 <xkb> etc etc
07:38:22 <earthy> xkb: you at Nijmegen?
07:38:25 <dustin`> Oh, neat!
07:38:31 <xkb> earthy, yes.. not atm
07:38:34 <xkb> but normally I am
07:38:38 <earthy> ah
07:38:43 <earthy> *zone*
07:38:49 <xkb> n3080
07:38:56 <dustin`> xkb: Out of curiosity, how competitive is admission?
07:39:00 <earthy> that's maths, right?
07:39:08 <xkb> dustin`, I dont have a clue to be fair
07:39:13 <xkb> earthy, yes
07:39:16 <earthy> dustin`: not really all that competitive
07:39:19 <xkb> but im working for cs
07:39:33 <earthy> it kinda depends though
07:39:42 <earthy> they need to have an open position
07:39:53 <xkb> indeed
07:40:02 <dustin`> Ahh, its a small group then?
07:40:05 <earthy> http://www.cs.kun.nl/aio-info/
07:41:17 <dustin`> Ahh, they require a master's degree.
07:41:56 <earthy> owh, yeah...
07:42:02 <earthy> sorry, that's default in .nl
07:42:11 <xkb> dustin`, thats not the case in the US?
07:42:14 <earthy> but it's a paid position... ;)
07:42:22 <xkb> "paid" that is :D
07:42:25 <earthy> xkb: nope. didn't you know that? :)
07:42:28 <dustin`> xkb: Nope.
07:42:28 <xkb> If you like small wagers
07:42:38 <xkb> earthy, no.. never knew that
07:42:56 <dustin`> Wages aren't an issue, as long as I can eat and have a beer now and then
07:43:06 <xkb> well.. you can :P
07:43:18 <dustin`> Apparently not though, since I don't have a master's =)
07:44:21 <xkb> If you have enough money you can always get yr masters in the Netherlands 
07:46:30 <dustin`> xkb: My situation is thus:  I'm in the BS/MS program for CS at RIT, and I'm almost done with the BS requirements, so I want to see if I can escape to a Ph.D program where I can submerge myself in logics and theory while receiving a modest stipend.  The whole bit about the thing being paid for is a large, but not overwhelming, motivating factor.
07:46:56 <xkb> dustin`, aha.. o
07:46:58 <xkb> ok
07:47:02 <dustin`> xkb: In other words:  I'm poor, and I like theory =)
07:47:06 <xkb> hehe
07:47:43 <dustin`> worst case is that I stay here and continue working for this company making stupid web applications part time, and then try again once I have my MS
07:48:20 <xkb> that's how I did my masters 2
07:48:38 <xkb> doing rather boring webprogramming
07:50:10 <tnks> hey guys. . . 
07:50:50 <tnks> what's a quick higher order function to turn [1 2 3 4 5 6] into [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
07:51:01 <tnks> where you can assume even items in the list.
07:51:15 <tnks> (sorry, I forgot the commas in the list).
07:51:17 <Igloo> higher order in what sense?
07:51:31 <tnks> like zip is higher order.
07:51:58 <Igloo> You could write something almost identical to foldr that gives you pais of elements
07:52:00 <tnks> maybe there isn't one. . . 
07:52:31 <tnks> maybe foldr is the way to go. . . 
07:53:01 <Igloo> If that was the only function I needed I'd just write the recursive function, though
08:04:12 <shapr> greetings danja
08:04:22 <shapr> looking for Haskell info?
08:05:31 <thebug> hello again, danja_ ! :)
08:07:00 <danja_> hi thebug!
08:07:12 * danja_ lurking again
08:09:06 * thebug lurk lurk
08:11:21 * shapr lurk lurk
08:11:30 <shapr> I suck at lurking.
08:11:35 <thebug> indeed ;)
08:13:07 <shapr> speaking of which, anyone want to write for Haskell Weekly?
08:13:25 <thebug> new newsletter or something?
08:13:30 <shapr> Or for that matter, want to suggest cheesy names?
08:13:32 <shapr> yup
08:13:53 <thebug> "All the Lambda that's fit to print" ?
08:14:11 <shapr> thebug: as in, I've had this idea off and on for years, but I think there's more Haskell traffic now, and more users now.
08:14:24 <Igloo> I think weekly is probably optimistic
08:14:37 <Igloo> Monthly might work
08:14:48 <shapr> Igloo: I was thinking of including darcs and other popular Haskell apps
08:15:06 <shapr> I'd like to try to bring up 'current issues' in the Haskell world that way
08:15:15 <Igloo> Even so. I could be wrong, of course
08:15:20 <shapr> like binary io, parsing network packets
08:15:34 <shapr> ok, I'll try starting it as a monthly.
08:17:42 <shapr> since I'm totally disorganized, I figure a wiki format is best.
08:18:01 <shapr> that way I can recruit writers, and whatever they write will just show up in the table of contents, etc
08:20:13 <shapr> any other suggestions, ideas, or related thoughts?
08:20:33 <shapr> to be honest, I realized OCaml has weekly news, and Haskell doesn't. that sucks :-)
08:21:50 <Igloo> :-)
08:22:20 <danja_> I'd be very grateful for a 'Total Newbie' section...
08:26:00 <thebug> 'shapr's n00b corner' would be a good column :)
08:29:44 <xkb> Anybody any idea how to rewrite this: http://hypernation.net/~xkb/test.hs so it uses mapMaybe? In some way you need to use mapMaybe for the + I think
08:31:22 <Lemmih> shapr: There are lots of topic I would like to read about (-:
08:32:59 <Lemmih> You're shadowing Data.Maybe.mapMaybe
08:33:14 <xkb> Lemmih, yeah I kno
08:33:15 <xkb> know
08:33:23 <xkb> this is an exercise from a book
08:33:30 <xkb> and you need to use those definitions
08:34:11 <TheHunter> xkb: mapMaybe is liftM or fmap
08:35:30 <Igloo> He's not shadowing it as it's not imported
08:35:54 <xkb> I only use Maybe from Prelude
08:35:59 <xkb> the datatype
08:37:54 <Lemmih> Igloo: It's still a mildly misleading identifier.
08:38:15 <xkb> Lemmih, eh.. rename is ur friend :P
08:38:26 <xkb> I was a bit distracted by it as well
08:38:36 <xkb> stange choice of names by the author of the book
08:38:39 <xkb> +r
08:49:46 <Lemmih> I wonder if I'm gonna be known as 'the Coding Clown' if I unicycle to school.
08:53:50 <dustin`> Lemmih: There was a bunch of unicylcers on my campus last year that were CS nerds.  I think we just called them dweebs =)
08:54:12 <dustin`> Coming from a fellow dweeb, of course
08:54:58 <Lemmih> I'm in high school. Being different is not generally accepted.
08:55:52 <dustin`> Lemmih: How big is your high school?
09:01:40 * talin hisses
09:02:02 <thebug> remember, today is International Talk Like a Pirate Day
09:02:08 <thebug> arrrrrrrrr
09:03:17 <danja> oh no, not *that day* again
09:03:19 <danja> me hearties!
09:03:25 <Lemmih> dustin`: Two or three hundred students.
09:06:43 <Igloo> The web doesn't seem sure if it's the 17th or 19th
09:07:01 <thebug> yeah, I noticed that too
09:07:01 <dustin`> Lemmih: Oh, you're screwed then.  However, never let the opinions of 300 meatheads get you down... do the unicycle anyway!
09:14:18 * Igloo segfaults a gtk2hs app a few times and finds it now won't appear
09:19:43 <Igloo> Oh, I bet it's off the screen
09:22:00 <Igloo> Hmm, although I can't alt-tab to it
09:34:58 <Igloo> Right, if I call my program cryptogram the window doesn't appear. There are no other programs called cryptogram running. What have I broken?
09:36:59 <xkb> Igloo, erm use linux ? ;-)
09:37:09 <xkb> or is it linux?
09:37:12 <Igloo> It is
09:37:17 <xkb> oh.
09:37:20 * xkb shuts up
09:37:21 <xkb> :D
09:40:29 <shapr> yow
09:40:50 <irsirius_> my computer is dying :(
09:40:54 <shapr> I'm sorry.
09:52:40 <Lemmih> What's the advantages of gtk2hs over wxHaskell?
09:59:02 <xkb> shapr, did you see my rant on hasell generated jpeg icons for avatar use earlier?
10:05:48 <shapr> er, no?
10:06:06 <shapr> anyway, I have to pack up my computer
10:06:15 <xkb> ok.. cya l8er then :d
10:06:21 <shapr> I'll be back tomorrow if I'm lucky, or days later if I'm unlucky.
10:06:24 <shapr> moving to a new apartment
10:06:30 <xkb> a nice..
10:06:33 <xkb> I think :D
10:18:25 <Igloo> Has anyone got gtk2hs installed?
10:21:09 <xkb> not me
10:21:15 <xkb> is there a port for mac?
10:22:15 <Igloo> No idea. I'm trying to port it to C now, so I can see if it's a Haskell issue. It seemed to be segfaulting in a Haskell function, so it seems likely  :-/
10:22:36 <xkb> still the problem with renaming/
10:22:37 <xkb> ?
10:23:13 <Igloo> Well, I gave up as I have no idea how to debug that. Now I'm trying to work out why it was segfaulting in the first place
10:23:30 <xkb> ok..
10:23:44 <xkb> good luck :D
10:24:39 <Igloo> http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/sec-textview.html mutter mutter
11:12:54 <Igloo> Right, doesn't happen in equivalent C
11:14:36 <Lemmih> Do you have the code online somewhere?
11:15:35 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/bug/h/ is the Haskell code
11:16:20 <Igloo> It segfaults when I run it and hold down the "f" key, say (should make black 'f's appear in a text box and red 'f's appear in a label)
11:22:31 <Igloo> Have you tried it?
11:23:57 <Lemmih> Nope. Haven't even installed gtk2hs. I just wanted to see the code (-:
11:24:10 <Igloo> Ah, OK  :-)
12:05:50 <tnks> man. . . 
12:06:01 <Lemmih> yes?
12:06:04 <tnks> I have a function that's running in O(n^2) time
12:06:07 <tnks> and it's killing me.
12:06:29 <tnks> runIntersecting (a1:a2:as) (b1:b2:bs) =
12:06:35 <tnks>     (intersecting a1 a2 b1 b2) ||
12:06:41 <tnks>     (runIntersecting (a1:a2:as) (b2:bs)) ||
12:06:47 <tnks>     (runIntersecting (a2:as) (b2:bs))
12:07:46 <tnks> I wish there was a way to see how many times a function is called.
12:08:02 <tnks> does anybody know of an elegant way to trace this function?
12:08:21 <Lemmih> Have you tried with trace?
12:08:31 <tnks> I'm new to ghc
12:08:38 <tnks> where's trace?
12:08:42 <Lemmih> @type Debug.Trace.trace
12:08:43 <lambdabot> Debug.Trace.trace :: forall a. String -> a -> a
12:10:55 <tnks> nice.
12:11:18 <Lemmih> You could also try to profile your program.
12:12:12 <Lemmih> Oejet: What do you see, oh great eye?
12:12:46 <Oejet> Lemmih: ICU.
12:13:35 <Lemmih> Bring any news from the motherland?
12:14:12 <Oejet> Lemmih: The Queens second son is getting divorced.
12:15:24 <Oejet> Lemmih: I have more news, if you are interested.
12:15:52 <Lemmih> Any of it Haskell related?
12:16:17 <Oejet> Lemmih: Nope.
12:16:22 <arauko> hahaha
12:18:29 <Oejet> Lemmih: Hmm, it seems that you are from the same country as me, so you ought to know some news from the motherland.
12:19:49 <tnks> awesome. . . 
12:19:57 <tnks> thanks a bunch for the trace help.
12:20:12 <tnks> I just realized that my code is way worse than O(n^2). . . 
12:20:20 <tnks> (which I thought was tractable for my set). . . 
12:20:33 <tnks> found a bug. . . 
12:20:36 <Lemmih> Oejet: Yeah. I read "Urban" and "Metro express" every day on my way to school.
12:24:16 <Lemmih> But their programming section is quite non-existing.
12:26:46 <Lemmih> Oejet: So, where are you studying/working?
12:27:39 <Oejet> Lemmih: DTU. Doing a lot of SML work now, which is almost Haskell :-)
15:29:23 <tnks> hello.
15:29:33 <tnks> if you're passed a tuple from a function.
15:29:56 <tnks> without pattern matching, what's a quick function to grab the first or second item in the tuple?
15:30:21 <tnks> maybe pattern matching's easier.
15:30:35 <arjanb> @type fst
15:30:36 <lambdabot> fst :: forall a b. (a, b) -> a
15:31:30 <arjanb> and snd for second item but both work only on pairs
15:33:22 <monochrom> Yeah use pattern matching, or write your own.
15:33:34 <monochrom> myfst (x,_,_) = x
15:35:04 <tnks> thanks.
15:35:16 <tnks> yeah, I did pattern matching, but it's nice to know that fst is there.
15:35:26 <tnks> I think that's something I really like about Haskell. . . 
15:35:39 <tnks> it's not necessarily bad style to not know every little function.
15:35:59 <tnks> as long as it's readable, and comparably efficient. . . 
15:36:23 <tnks> it gives you more freedom to think about the problem, without compromising as much style.
16:17:51 <tnks> hey guys,
16:18:15 <tnks> how do you control the formatting of a FloatToString conversion?
16:18:35 <tnks> I'm looking for the kind of control you get with a printf C call.
16:22:00 <Igloo> There are functinos called something like show[EFG]Float in the Prelude or one of the standard libraries
16:26:04 <tnks> (looks like formatRealFloat does it). . . 
18:02:53 <roconnor> If I apt-get install xemacs21, do I need anything else to get haskell support?
18:09:51 <roconnor> ahh haskell-mode
18:36:39 <Michael`> http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/105.html - Anyone that can complete than problem - msg me, ill pay you :)
18:45:58 <heatsink> only 39 hours to complete it?
18:51:19 <Michael`> why 39?
18:51:47 <heatsink> That's what it says on the website
18:51:57 <heatsink> http://acm.uva.es/
22:10:33 <Gahhh> there are no commercial haskell compilers, are there
