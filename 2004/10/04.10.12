00:15:43 * shrimpx watches the hours go by as ghc builds
00:18:11 <dons> hehe. what on?
00:18:33 <dons> you can build in in ~15 mins on a fast box, if you set the right build flags
00:18:46 <dons> (no prof, no -O, no split objs)
00:19:34 <dons> also fast if you just start with .hc source (like the openbsd port tree version does)
00:20:18 <shrimpx> ah
00:21:09 <dons> also, don't usually need to build hslibs
00:21:42 <shrimpx> shrug, i built everything. this is a sparc
00:21:45 <shrimpx> sol9
00:22:50 <dons> ok. how'd it go (out of interest)
00:23:06 <dons> solaris can be tricksy at times -- we don't get to test it very often
00:24:23 <shrimpx> still building, but pretty smooth.
00:24:57 <dons> good. sometimes problems with headers, readline or cpp. that's about all i've come across
00:25:14 <shrimpx> i had to explicitly set some make variables, cuz readline and ncurses are in unconventional locations
00:25:59 <dons> there is a sol8 binary up there. is that any good to you?
00:26:09 <dons> s/there/http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_621.html/
00:27:43 <shrimpx> haven't tried...
00:38:19 <kosmikus|away> dons: you're the haskell-plugin guy, right?
00:39:27 <kosmikus> @seen SyntaxNinja
00:39:28 <lambdabot> I saw SyntaxNinja leaving #haskell 4 hours 31 minutes 12 seconds ago.
00:53:51 <Jan_w> anyone have any luck building a win32 dll ? for a very small program, it works, but somewhat bigger like, lets say the DES algoritm, i get some memory or stack problem it seems
01:02:45 <musasabi> shapr: how is the idea for the Haskell monthly thing coming along?
01:03:13 * Jan_w would be suprised if shapr was awake :)
01:03:34 <musasabi> well there is the backlog..
01:03:39 <Jan_w> I'm even surprise to see myself awake :)
01:04:05 <musasabi> I could perhaps write a tutorial to monad transformers.
01:04:15 <Jan_w> musasabi: which does not show him since 1:30 :)
01:05:41 <musasabi> no, I meant that he will see that in the backlog, when he wakes up.
01:06:19 <Jan_w> musasabi: oh i see :)
01:07:18 <musasabi> hmm is there any sensible alternative to gnus yet? (for 20+ mailing lists to be sorted in different folders and with news support) ?
01:07:40 <tuomov> .procmailrc
01:08:04 <ibid> news support in .procmailrc?
01:08:28 <tuomov> for sorting
01:08:30 <shrimpx> haha i read "guns" instead of "gnus"
01:08:44 <Jan_w> shrimpx: twisted mind :)
01:08:46 <shrimpx> guns for mailing lists?
01:09:44 <Jan_w> shrimpx: remind me of this: http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/
01:10:01 <shrimpx> ya
01:10:17 <shrimpx> i had a script that did that to my mail for a while
01:54:52 <dons> kosmikus: yep
02:00:23 <kosmikus> dons: please write something for the HCAR!
02:01:09 <kosmikus> dons: and could either you or ozone or anyone who feels responsible write something about the current state of the dynamic loader?
02:01:25 <dons> yep. I certainly will! :)
02:03:11 <kosmikus> thanks
02:04:22 <dons> were you thinking I should write about something other than hs-plugins (which is the dynamic loader library these days)?
02:08:20 <musasabi> Is there anything to profile concurrent haskell?
02:08:30 <musasabi> I am mainly interested in various queue lengths.
02:11:01 <kosmikus> dons: ah, ok, so haskell-plugins and dynamic loader are the same thing?
02:12:03 <kosmikus> dons: well, then that's the thing I want you to write about ... but if you want to write about more, that's fine ... anything else you're working on/maintaining/know everything about?
02:13:22 <dons> i just hack ghc otherwise ... and i think there might be someone covering that ;)
02:17:12 <kosmikus> dons: what are you working on in ghc?
02:19:51 <dons> (see last 2 hcars ;) just openbsd support: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/haskell_openbsd.html
02:20:29 <dons> also the new backend and 64 bit support, but that was the last HCAR
02:22:30 <dons> no sexy types or anything like that
02:24:56 <mayhem> hey
02:24:58 <mayhem> anyone experimented in role logic ?
02:26:10 <kosmikus> dons: the bsd support was not in the last report, was it?
02:27:56 <dons> not mentioned .. but there are many platforms improving all the time
02:28:37 <dons> I guess the above link is useful to the community, however
02:30:29 <kosmikus> dons: there could be some short statement like the sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 (Debian and Fedora Core)
02:31:15 <dons> oh. ok. yes, then. I'll write something about OpenBSD too
02:31:17 <kosmikus> dons: if you think the rest is either in previous reports or covered by other people, that's ok
02:32:02 <shapr> musasabi: good morning!
02:32:21 * kosmikus will add a section on Gentoo
02:35:19 <kosmikus> is there something like replicate in python?
02:35:35 <Jan_w> shapr: god morgon
02:35:41 <shapr> hoi Jan_w 
02:35:45 <shapr> kosmikus: sort of...
02:35:58 <shapr> you can multiply a list
02:36:10 <kosmikus> ah, thanks
02:40:38 <kosmikus> can one turn an operator into a function without fully eta-expanding it? (still python, sorry)
02:41:01 <Lemmih> shapr: I got my uni back from the blacksmith.
02:44:48 <musasabi> morning shapr
02:45:08 <shapr> kosmikus: er, huh?
02:45:22 <shapr> Lemmih: cool does it work?
02:45:59 <shapr> kosmikus: import operator gives you function forms of most operators
02:46:25 <shapr> kosmikus: import operator; help(operator.add)
02:46:36 <kosmikus> shapr: thanks again
02:46:36 <Lemmih> shapr: Yes.
02:47:28 <tromp> morning shapr
02:47:32 <shapr> hoi tromp 
02:47:48 <tromp> what was wrong with ur yni?
02:47:51 <tromp> uni
02:53:48 <Lemmih> The saddle didn't fit.
02:54:52 <Lemmih> Unicycles have apparently changed over the last decade.
02:57:42 <tromp> how can the seat that always fitted in the past no longer fits:-?
03:01:16 <shapr> tromp: I sent my old seat to Lemmih 
03:02:00 <tromp> aha. and you got a new seat?
03:02:14 <shapr> yes, I upgraded to a kris holm seat
03:05:14 <tromp> i'm waiting to see recumbent unicycles:)
03:06:02 <shapr> there are a few
03:06:35 <tromp> i found http://www.unicycling.com/garage/recumben.htm
03:06:46 <tuomov> put wings on the front and cycle so fast that the front stays in air?
03:06:47 <tromp> but that's still very upright
03:06:55 <Lemmih> I think I'm gonna take it for a spin.
03:07:38 <shapr> Lemmih: have fun :-)
03:09:58 <musasabi> My dns server code is working quite well except that mozilla cannot resolve google..
03:11:13 <shapr> are you using Peter Simons' hs-dns?
03:12:25 <musasabi> no, my own code.
03:12:51 <shapr> oh cool
03:13:37 <Si\> does anyone know if you can have mutually recursive modules involving data-types with derived instances?
03:21:21 <kosmikus> Si\: I don't know, but I'd expect it to work: kind information about imported data types should be sufficient for deriving to work
03:23:30 <Si\> kosmikus: What do you means?
03:24:03 <Si\> If I have two data types in modules A and B, where one is data A = A String deriving Data, and the other is data B = B A deriving Data?
03:25:06 <tuomov> you can't unfortunately easily have modules that depend on each other with current ghc
03:25:19 <tuomov> but it should be possible if you wrote a bootstrap .hi
03:25:20 * shapr bounces around to attempt to wake up
03:25:59 <tuomov> this is a big problem that should be fixed
03:26:10 <Si\> yes, I can create a hi-boot easily if I removed the derivings, but if I add them, deriving Data on B checks also whether A is an instance of Data
03:26:34 <Si\> and I can't figure out how to declare that there is an instance of Data for A
03:36:05 <kosmikus> can't you put an instance declaration into the .hi-boot file?
03:38:27 <Lemmih> shapr: It's so much better than my original seat!
03:40:39 <bourbaki> hi
03:40:42 <Lemmih> Hey
03:40:48 <bourbaki> *bows*
03:43:25 <Si\> kosmikus; you can only put type, data, newtype and function declarations in the hi-boot
03:43:39 <Si\> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#MUTUAL-RECURSION
03:44:53 <kosmikus> ok
03:45:19 <kosmikus> "You cannot declare instances or derive them automatically" seems pretty clear, unfortunately
03:45:20 <Si\> This isn't something I can avoid either; XML Schemata can be mututally recursive and thus so must their equivelant modules
03:47:12 <Si\> I spose I just don't get why you can't just create an empty instance for the type-check and then it will fill it in with the full-body later
03:48:06 <kosmikus> I think you could ... it's just not implemented
03:48:42 <Si\> I guess no-one has really _needed_ mutually recursive modules before
03:49:09 <Si\> but there isn't anyway around it
03:50:59 <Si\> I mean I can go ahead and write the module generators, but anything involving mutual recursion won't work
03:52:08 <kosmikus> Si\: why not generate the mutually depend schemata into one module?
03:52:50 <Si\> impossible; namespace mapping is required
03:53:16 <Si\> each module must map a hierarchical namespace to an XML namespace to work
03:55:10 <Si\> Since I can't use type-classes to encode meta-data (you can only have instances of Data and Typeable to use Generics) that won't work either
03:55:45 <Si\> I'll just to have to include that as a limitation on the software
03:58:53 <Si\> But I'll have to see if someone can implement instances, because that is too much of a limitation now we have Generics
04:01:37 <kosmikus> Si\: you can selectively export into different modules
04:02:00 <kosmikus> Si\: you generate a number of datatypes plus (derived) instances in one module
04:02:12 <kosmikus> Si\: then you have several modules, each of which exports only one of the datatypes
04:03:28 <Si\> So one datatype maps to a single module? How does that help?
04:04:58 <Si\> Actually what I could do is generate Data & Typeable instances auxilary using TH
04:04:59 <kosmikus> Si\: well, not necessarily one
04:05:31 <kosmikus> Si\: the idea is to separate the module containing the actual definitions from the ones you need to do the XML namespace management
04:06:09 * kosmikus is gone for lunch
04:06:12 <Si\> But a data-type always has the same namespace as the module it is declared in 
04:06:21 <Si\> I'm sure I'll figure something out
04:11:45 <musasabi> Is it possible to get haddoc support cpp ?
04:12:46 <musasabi> *haddock
04:36:49 <desrt> viv; morning.
04:36:58 * desrt yawns a lot
04:41:26 <mayhem> any project related to role logic around ?
04:41:58 <kosmikus> Si\: I guess I don't understand the problem
04:53:36 <shapr> yow!!
04:55:35 <psi> yow
04:55:56 <shapr> hej psi 
04:56:23 <psi> tjo
04:56:31 <shapr> wazzup?
04:56:54 <psi> i'm customizing my desktop :-)
05:00:51 <shapr> Jan_w: hey, what hotmail account was that doc sent from?
05:20:57 * shapr 's opinion of Java programmers goes down dramatically.
05:29:38 <ticP4> shapr, how come?
05:43:32 <shapr> as part of the discussion about that guy 'programmer' someone said it wasn't my job to report him to his teacher, and that there's nothing wrong with doing homework for money.
05:44:09 <blackdog> shapr: an elisp programmer is me!
05:44:14 <shapr> I asked that same person if they would do a certification exam for someone else if they were paid to do it. They said yes, if there were no personal risk involved.
05:44:17 <shapr> blackdog: w00!
05:44:26 <CLxyz> i'm of the opinion he'll get screwed during the exam anyways
05:44:38 <blackdog> ugly hacky elisp code, to be fair, but it does what i want. god bless programmable editors.
05:44:56 * CLxyz chants go VI
05:45:15 <shapr> I don't have a degree, but I'd think that people who do have a degree wouldn't want the pool of people with a degree polluted with clueless people.
05:45:20 <blackdog> scripting vi is not such a walk in the park...
05:45:30 <blackdog> shapr: oh, you optimist.
05:45:41 <shapr> well, same thing for certifications.
05:45:49 <tuomov> it's already polluted thanks to increased intake of universities
05:45:56 <blackdog> i wonder how long it's been since degrees or certification in CS implied clue?
05:46:06 <tuomov> all degrees have gone through a major inflation
05:46:18 <shapr> in that case, why do people go to college at all?
05:46:38 <tuomov> because soon even garbage truck drivers need an msc?
05:46:44 <CLxyz> since never?
05:46:50 <CLxyz> okay, maybe ~20 years ago :P
05:47:38 <shapr> so the only real way to know you're getting a qualified programmer is to look at their open source code and chec k to see if they really wrote it?
05:47:45 <tuomov> of course, someone who does well in secondary school may not do well in a university and vice-versa
05:48:08 <tuomov> so it is really hard to decide who should get to study... everyone should
05:48:14 <CLxyz> tuomov if you were "driving" 20 trucks via autonomous software? probably
05:48:38 <CLxyz> shapr: is releasing source that big/useful a deal?
05:49:10 <shapr> if I don't know someone, and I want to hire them, I look at the code they've written.
05:49:23 <shapr> Actually, even if I do know them, I still look at the code they've written.
05:49:28 <dons> I would certainly want to see their code
05:49:40 <shapr> Shall I pick examples from this channel? :-)
05:49:49 <tuomov> of course, some employers look negatively at writing free software..
05:50:02 * CLxyz thinks is time to release some code
05:50:02 <shapr> I've been using tuomov's code for years, with no trouble.
05:50:16 <shapr> I've been using dons' code for several months with no trouble.
05:50:33 <shapr> Just to pick on people in the current conversation ;-)
05:50:34 * CLxyz googles for tuomov's and dons's code
05:50:59 <shapr> tuomov wrote Ion, which is my favorite wm by far.
05:51:13 <shapr> dons wrote hs-plugins, which solved one of my greatest problems with Haskell.
05:51:39 <blackdog> tuomov: you're the Ion guy? Man, you rock.
05:51:44 * shapr grins
05:52:33 <CLxyz> ion looks cool
05:52:38 <CLxyz> haven't tried it though
05:52:43 <blackdog> <abusing hospitality> any idea why mplayer in SDL mode crashes ion sometimes? </>
05:52:45 <shapr> tuomov: why would employers look negatively at free software?
05:53:03 <blackdog> distrust of open source hippies?
05:53:07 <dons> naive if they do. 
05:53:08 <tuomov> some think it affects the work they do at work
05:53:17 <CLxyz> mostly legal issues
05:53:29 <tuomov> I had an argument of this in my old job
05:53:41 <shapr> I think it does affect the work they do at work, it means those people are skilled and motivated.
05:53:44 <tuomov> of course there's nothing they can do about it by the finnish legislation
05:53:48 <tuomov> but they didn't like it
05:54:14 <CLxyz> mainly they're afraid whatever you have released/will release will put them into a legal bind wrt to their current software
05:54:51 <tuomov> the company mainly wrote specs for algorithmic software
05:55:08 <tuomov> so they weren't a software company per se
05:55:12 <shapr> I would much rather hire a bunch of open-source hippies and build a motivated and skilled team of people who could solve any problems they get...
05:55:29 <blackdog> do it man, I'd work for you. You need one bozo on the team. :)
05:55:33 <CLxyz> I wouldnt :P
05:55:40 <shapr> CLxyz: why not?
05:56:06 <CLxyz> I don't think just because you've got a group of opensource hippies , you'd make a good tem
05:56:32 <shapr> Programming is one activity where your boss often has zero-ability to monitor you, even if he's logging your every keystroke, the best thing you can do is to get motivated people, give them interesting problems to solve, and keep them motivated by getting the boring stuff out of their way.
05:56:49 * shapr notes that sentence desperately needs refactoring.
05:56:53 <CLxyz> I would, however, be more favourable towards those who have code out in the open
05:57:08 <blackdog> It's not a sufficient condition, sure. But at least you've got _some_ data - a BSc from most universities means 2/3rds of 4/5ths of sweet fanny adams.
05:57:11 <CLxyz> shapr: that's the job of *ALL* good managers/leaders
05:58:00 <shapr> A manager is actually underneath the programmers who really do the work, he should be the gofer for all of them. His job is to make it as easy as possible for them to focus on the essential difficulties of the task, not the accidental difficulties.
05:58:30 <CLxyz> again, that's the job of the *all* manager
05:58:37 <CLxyz> s/manager/mangers
05:58:54 * shapr wonders if this is the fable of the 'dog in the manager'
05:59:04 <blackdog> I don't think so. The manager of a Mickey Ds wouldn't work that way...
05:59:22 <blackdog> shapr: no jpegs, i beg you
05:59:25 <shapr> but they could, a tight team only requires the right attitudes.
05:59:28 <shapr> blackdog: haha!
05:59:50 <CLxyz> blackdog: well, if you wanted to run a really successful McD's, they would
05:59:59 <blackdog> that's it, i guess. McDs work with unmotivated teenagers getting paid bugger-all.
06:00:01 <shapr> I've seen high-quality fast-food shops run by a smart and kind manager.
06:00:18 <CLxyz> afterall, a manager can only handle, at most, 2 orders at once
06:00:30 <blackdog> they're not really in that business... consistency over quality.
06:01:05 <CLxyz> blackdog: it doesn't matter what your aim is.  1 person can only do so much
06:01:47 <shapr> But one person can be the seed crystal for a good team.
06:01:54 <blackdog> Clxyz, yeah, i understand that. I'm saying that a manager of a fast food store has a much more authoritarian role than the manager of "knowledge workers"
06:02:27 <CLxyz> matter of degree, blackdog ?
06:02:47 <CLxyz> shapr: at which point he's responsible for making his team do well, no?
06:03:15 <blackdog> Clxyz: everything's a matter of degree if you push it hard enough. how about a prison warden? :)
06:03:21 <tuomov> I only believe in self-management.
06:03:28 <tuomov> No bosses, thank you.
06:03:53 <tuomov> And free software is a prime example that it works.
06:04:11 <ticP4> not really. you need someone to lead a project.
06:04:29 <tuomov> Yes, free software has leaders, but no-one is a boss.
06:04:49 <shapr> I agree with tuomov, self-management is the secret.
06:04:53 <dblhelix> (catching up) shapr: when can I apply? I'm still looking for a job, you know ;)
06:04:54 <tuomov> No-one has authority beyond his expertise.
06:05:13 <shapr> I once wrote a speech about 'constitutional anarchy' where I explained this idea.
06:05:47 <CLxyz> tuomov: and thats why you see so many open source software die a slow, painful, miserable death
06:05:48 <blackdog> it seems to work really well for some things - stable OSes, system software, that kind of thing. coming up with good, coherent GUIs is one area where it doesn't seem to work so well.
06:06:03 <tuomov> CLxyz: companies die too.
06:06:10 <shapr> I said that policement are 'professional mothers' because they tell you to not put your hand on that hot stove, and to drive slower that 150 miles an hour.
06:06:55 <CLxyz> true that
06:07:02 <tuomov> blackdog: the movement consists mostly of hackers atm
06:07:04 <CLxyz> shapr: except on autoban ;)
06:07:20 <tuomov> and some (like I :) oppose windows-style guis 
06:07:26 <shapr> and I said that I have a friend who's a black belt in seven different martial arts, and he has all that professional mother organization inside his head.
06:08:25 <shapr> Basically, government is for those who can't manage themselves.
06:08:54 <CLxyz> I disagree?
06:08:56 <tuomov> no, government is for keeping those who have the power in power
06:08:57 <blackdog> tuomov: sure, that's sort of the problem. Every hacker builds his own little information ecosystem, and can't understand why other people don't have the time or inclination to do so. I'd even say that it makes the hacker much more productive, but it also means that there's not much support for other sorts.
06:09:30 <shapr> tuomov: sure, nowadays, but that wasn't the original idea.
06:09:40 <tuomov> My vis proposal (http://iki.fi/tuomov/vis/) kind of deals with this problem
06:10:33 <shapr> CLxyz: well, my speech is there to disagree with, it's a purposefully extreme viewpoint that's designed to point out some flaws in the current system.
06:11:06 <tuomov> shapr: to my knowledge, people were much more self-managing in the past than nowadays
06:11:23 <shapr> sure, but that's because you got dead if you screwed up
06:11:23 <tuomov> free artisans, peasants and so on instead of hordes of factory workers
06:12:52 <tuomov> a lot of modern state structure was created to control those workers who were opposed to such a system of wage slavery at that time
06:13:02 <tuomov> now, almost nobody questions wage slavery anymore
06:13:40 <shapr> but programming is changing that
06:13:48 <shapr> because programming doesn't work by-hour
06:14:09 <tuomov> yes. if just the employers realised that..
06:14:15 <shapr> they will
06:18:13 <shapr> at least, the ones who realize it will continue to make money
06:19:08 <blackdog> tuomov: interesting article. i sorta suspect that presentation-neutral formats will always get abused by bozos, though - look at html...
06:20:11 <tuomov> the current state of most commercial html pages is like that of current guis... vis would be like structural html + style in css
06:21:51 <tuomov> the problem is that html allows specifying style
06:22:27 <tuomov> of course, if something like vis ever was reality, someone might want to "extend" it..
06:22:50 <shapr> uh oh
06:22:50 <blackdog> yes, but as long as there are people just trying to make it look a particular way on a particular platform, you'll have that problem.
06:22:53 <shapr> not the blink tag!
06:24:18 <CLxyz> the blink tag!
06:31:46 * shapr decides to ressurect his blog
06:32:01 <shapr> I gotta ask Pete for 0.0.6
06:37:48 <shapr> hiya karingo 
06:39:49 <shapr> greets ows, more Haskell questions?
06:40:55 <ows> Hi shapr :)
06:41:34 <ows> well, I don't have specif questions and think that it's boring for you 
06:43:55 <ows> well, but ok.. has haskell some structures like Threads in Java?
06:43:59 <shapr> yes
06:44:05 <shapr> Control.Concurrent
06:44:19 <ows> and about processes too?
06:44:34 <shapr> Haskell has fast coroutines, as well as anonymous and set OS threads.
06:44:41 <shapr> what about processes?
06:48:03 <ows> where I can find haskell API? haskell.org, like I can find J2SK in java.sun?
06:48:28 <Lemmih> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html
06:49:39 <ows> does it has support to mobile agents, like aglets?
06:50:11 <Lemmih> mobile agents?
06:50:50 <shapr> Manuel Chakravarty did some work along those lines called Goffin - http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/
06:51:08 <shapr> As I remember it was focussed on mobile code in Haskell, but I haven't tried it myself.
06:51:46 <shapr> I have just swapped emails with the man responsible for both distributed and parallel Haskell, so I'll tell you what I learn...
06:59:30 <musasabi> ows: what kind of mobile agent functionality are you interested in?
07:01:11 <ows> like aglets in java, do you know?
07:01:54 <ows> not a specif functionality.. but something like aglet API
07:02:03 <ows> *specific
07:02:13 <shapr> I think Erlang-OTP style would be nice.
07:02:34 <shapr> musasabi: the mobile types we discussed would probably do it.
07:03:59 <musasabi> I don't like the idea of executing potentially malicious code and thus have some problems with mobile code.
07:04:36 <shapr> it'd still be better than nothing.
07:05:13 <shapr> like I said before, it would be enough for a basic mnesia implementation.
07:05:16 <musasabi> transparent serialization of data on the other hand would be very usefull.
07:06:50 <shapr> hej skeel
07:07:00 <SyntaxNinja> morning shapr
07:07:05 <shapr> greetz SyntaxNinja 
07:07:08 <musasabi> ows: I don't know the api, so it is hard to say whether doing something similar would be hard in haskell.
07:07:30 <SyntaxNinja> I'm still baffled by the fact that I can't mount my ipod if I've mounted my camera and vice-versa; I have to reboot between them :(
07:07:36 <skeel> hej shapr
07:13:48 <Igloo> They might cause conflicting modules to be autoloaded or something - what does lsmod say before and after inserting them?
07:14:01 <shapr> skeel: are you new to #haskell?
07:18:18 <skeel> yes... I read an article about haskell and got interested
07:19:00 <skeel> I've only worked with advanced shellscripts, php/sql, and some java... never touched C though, so I dont know how useful haskell might be to my daily operations
07:19:04 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: someone on #debian explained; the 2nd one is on sdb instead of sda
07:19:10 <Igloo> Ah
07:19:40 <blackdog> C isn't really a prereq for haskell...
07:20:05 <shapr> what time did programmer show up yesterday?
07:20:07 <Cale> C is almost an antireq for Haskell :)
07:20:35 <shapr> Ross Paterson is asking when this person sent the spec.
07:20:43 <blackdog> Well, maybe it helps to be burned by C to appreciate Haskell. :)
07:20:56 <Lemmih> haha
07:20:56 <tuomov> but asm is req for any kind of programming :)
07:20:57 <Cale> yes, I suppose it would
07:21:16 <tuomov> you've got to some degree what the machine is doing
07:21:49 <vegai> http://croquetproject.org/ whoa
07:21:59 <shapr> yah, croquet is awesome
07:22:13 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: he didn't send it in email?
07:22:30 <shapr> no, he pasted text to me, and sent the ms.doc file to Jan_w, who isn't active at the moment.
07:22:40 <shapr> oh maybe I can look at the file creation time
07:22:55 <shapr> ah, 22:18
07:23:04 <tuomov> ygh. 3d wm
07:23:22 <tuomov> when will they learn, that bringing 2d concepts to 3d just makes things confusing
07:23:23 <blackdog> do you need red/green goggles?
07:23:40 <tuomov> you need some completely new concepts for 3d interaction
07:23:58 <SyntaxNinja> it's a .doc? it might have identifying info in it
07:24:00 <blackdog> tuomov, I'm curious: how do you use ion? Many desktops?
07:24:23 <tuomov> yes, of course
07:24:48 <vegai> tuomov: it seems to me that croquet uses 2d concepts only for legacy stuff
07:24:51 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: I tried that too, nothing.
07:25:07 <blackdog> ok. seen a few people use one desktop and 18-20 xterms all tiled up...
07:25:16 <blackdog> sorry, not tiled, stacked.
07:25:58 <shapr> totally pwmed?
07:26:05 * shapr chortles evilly
07:26:19 <blackdog> ?
07:26:28 <tuomov> the latter screenshots seem to have something in the way of real 3d worlds
07:26:53 <shapr> blackdog: pwned is online-FPS speak for "owned"
07:27:05 <shapr> comes from a common qwerty typo
07:27:10 <tuomov> but most of the information people view on their screens is text and 2d images, and is absolutely pointless to take that to 3d
07:27:28 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: there must be a way to bust htis guy! 
07:27:30 <shapr> I think pwm was the first window manager that let you stack a bunch of the same app in the same place with tabs on tha window.
07:27:35 <blackdog> oh, ok. you said pwmed, though: typo on typo. thought the second two stood for window manager. :)
07:27:37 <SyntaxNinja> aren't there logs, btw?
07:27:43 <shapr> so I thought 'pwmed' was very punny.
07:27:48 <blackdog> it did? oh, me confused.
07:28:44 <shapr> blackdog: I think the standard response to that sort of pun is to call it 'stratospheric'
07:29:00 <tuomov> before a 3d environment you need content that benefits from 3d
07:29:01 <shapr> much like the irregular webcomic orcs joke
07:29:31 <shapr> blackdog: http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cgi-bin/comic.pl?comic=470
07:29:33 <blackdog> "through to the keeper", to maintain my ocker presence. (Ozone will now call me a knob.)
07:29:46 <tuomov> taking the last step in emulating real-life desktop is not something people should strife for
07:29:58 <tuomov> s/strife/strive/
07:30:10 <ows> Why lisp && haskell are lambda calculus based FP lang, what does it mean, only related to haskell compiler syntax?
07:31:08 <shapr> no, related to the underlying computational model as well.
07:31:11 <ows> What difference does it brings to us, when compared, for example, with algol based lang, expression based (logical or matg based)
07:31:13 <blackdog> right, i'm buggered. g'night all: with any luck, i'll have won a mac laptop in the morning. :)
07:31:17 <shapr> turing machines and lambda calculus are equivalent
07:31:22 <shapr> g'night blackdog 
07:32:04 <shapr> ows: you've asked a question with a very large answer.
07:32:13 <shapr> you may want to start here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus
07:33:41 <dons> tuomov: basic boot loader is working
07:33:57 <dons> yay!
07:34:03 <tuomov> nice
07:34:26 <shapr> ows: you may also want to investigate the call-by-name evaluation model (and the others for fun).
07:35:10 <shapr> ows: I can tell you more later, but I have to do some paying work right now...
07:35:53 <ows> k.. go
07:36:42 <ows> the limitations that I'm seeing in lisp and haskell (lambda calculus based lang) are related to code distributed computing modules (app)...
07:38:14 <musasabi> ows: e.g. erlang is a functional language which is suited very well to distributed computing.
07:38:15 <ows> A++ language?
07:38:49 <musasabi> ows: making mutation explicit makes it easier to reason about concurrent (and distributed) behaviour.
07:40:31 <ows> do you have some experience with erlang? is it fast to produce DC app? and about performance? is it better that java, c?
07:42:09 <basti_> hi
07:44:05 <TheHunter> Something i've always wondered about erlang: Given it doesn't have higher-order functions, why is it called a functional language? guards and list comprehension don't make it functional, do they?
07:44:28 <TheHunter> (but i have to admit i only have a slight idea of what erlang might be)
07:44:44 <basti_> hmm lambda makes a language functional i think
07:44:49 <basti_> that functions can be values.
07:45:31 <TheHunter> but if functions can be values, then it has higer-order functions, hasn't it?
07:45:42 <basti_> hm yes. okay.
07:46:01 <basti_> but i think you can have higher-order functions without function-values
07:46:17 <basti_> hm
07:46:18 <basti_> can you?
07:47:35 <TheHunter> i think you can't but i'm not 100$ sure of the terminology
07:47:44 <TheHunter> s/\$/%/
07:48:12 <basti_> hm
07:48:17 * basti_ ponders
07:48:21 <basti_> call-by-something.
07:49:12 <tuomov> if you could have higher-order functions without function-values, one might perhaps say C has higher-order functions?
07:49:28 <basti_> C has function-values strictly speaking.
07:49:32 <tuomov> you can pass function pointers to other functions, _but_, you can't return new functions from them
07:49:56 <basti_> hmm
07:49:59 <basti_> yes you can't combine
07:50:03 <basti_> cos C has no lambda
07:50:18 <basti_> so lambda makes a language what people call functional i think.
07:50:47 <tuomov> but that alone doesn't yet make a language functional, or else Lua and Python would be functional
07:51:02 <goron> tuomov: So you claim that it is impossible to create a runtime functional language in C?
07:51:11 <basti_> Python is functional if you do it right ;)
07:51:18 <tuomov> of course you can pass containers for a function and parameters
07:51:22 <TheHunter> hmm, i'd say c has neither higher-order functions nor function-values, but this might be just a matter of taste
07:51:47 <tuomov> but the language doesn't directly support this
07:52:03 <basti_> so its a rather wobbly word.
07:52:05 <basti_> ;)
07:53:02 <goron> That depends on your definition of *direct*.
07:53:36 <goron> Haskell supports it more direct. ;)
07:53:47 <tuomov> assembler supports it more directly than C
07:53:57 <basti_> yes.
07:55:23 <tuomov> in asm you can create new code that jumps to the code to execute along with parameters
07:55:44 <tuomov> in C you can't call such a run-time generated function in the normal way
07:56:00 <tuomov> in C++ you can overload operators, but the object still has a special type
07:56:05 <musasabi> TheHunter: erlang *does* have higher order functions.
07:56:10 <blackdog> before i go to sleep: GNU Lightning lets you do that...
07:56:24 <musasabi> ows: erlang is fast enough for most purposes.
07:57:16 <TheHunter> musasabi: ah, thanks. Why do I often read that it doesn't have hof's?
07:57:38 <musasabi> TheHunter: it didn't originally have them, but they were added long ago to the language.
07:58:48 <TheHunter> musasabi: ok, sounds like a reasonable explanation.
08:02:11 <kosmikus> could anyone explain to me how to use the haskell-unsafe debian thing? if I blindly copy the line for sources.list from the webpage, I get an error
08:03:45 <TheHunter> this one works for me: deb http://haskell-unsafe.alioth.debian.org/archive/i386/ dists/unstable/binary-i386/
08:04:11 <SyntaxNinja> kosmikus: what's the error?
08:05:00 <kosmikus> ah, TheHunter's line might work
08:05:24 <Igloo> What didn't work?
08:05:30 <Igloo> And yeah, what error?
08:05:49 <kosmikus> the exact line from http://haskell-unsafe.alioth.debian.org/haskell-unsafe.html
08:06:16 <kosmikus> apt starts looking in directories like unstable/testing that don't exist
08:06:59 <Igloo> What version of apt is that?
08:07:31 <kosmikus> ah, did apt change in this respect?
08:07:39 <musasabi> I can reproduce that. (that is the line without i386 not working)
08:07:43 <musasabi> I think it worked before.
08:07:44 <Igloo> I have no idea
08:07:46 <kosmikus> it's probably quite old, 0.5.14
08:08:04 <musasabi> apt 0.5.25 for linux i386 compiled on May  8 2004 13:10:05
08:08:58 <Igloo> Ah, I only have unstable in my sources.list. Adding testing makes it break for me too
08:10:02 <Igloo> Ah, the . is at the wrong end of the list. Thanks!
08:10:32 <kosmikus> this makes sense
08:10:43 <kosmikus> then I even understand the why
08:10:45 <kosmikus> thanks
08:12:46 <Igloo> I think we're slightly abusing the syntax there and it should probably be 3 separate lines, but never mind
08:13:52 <kosmikus> as long as it works ...
08:14:21 <Igloo> :-)

08:52:23 <bourbaki> hi
08:52:35 <musasabi> hello
09:00:32 <bourbaki> anyone here who is familiar with arrows and has a bit of time listening to my problem/idea?
09:08:01 <vidvandre> how does one get auto indentation in vim for .hs files?
09:08:13 <musasabi> sorry don't know about arrows.. => sauna
09:19:10 <CLxyz> arrows?
09:19:52 * esap understands something about arrows.
09:24:41 <bourbaki> esap: ah you might be the right person
09:24:55 <bourbaki> esap: imagine a whole network with nodes and arrows
09:25:13 * basti_ could follow this step.
09:25:32 <esap> ok.
09:25:36 <bourbaki> esap: now you mark some of the nodes and you can easily see if its an input or output node by determineing if its a source or a sink node
09:26:16 <bourbaki> now i want to crunsh all the effected arrows in between to a single function and rip it out of the network and insert this new arrow again into the network
09:27:02 <bourbaki> and my approach is to collect all paths from each output node to the input nodes
09:27:38 <bourbaki> though i have to watch out for some special cases where i build products of arrows on the codomain side
09:28:06 * basti_ can not follow anymore
09:28:29 <bourbaki> does that make any sense or is there some graph algo or such that will let me process that kind of stuff?
09:28:43 <bourbaki> basti_: i want to make a subgraph an arrow
09:28:48 <basti_> yes i got that
09:28:55 <basti_> but i didnt understand what special cases you mean
09:29:00 <bourbaki> ie
09:29:19 <bourbaki> i have an operator that keeps the same input for two arrows like that
09:29:24 <esap> bourbaki: Isn't that just combining all input nodes to one node and all output nodes to one node?
09:29:53 <bourbaki> glue: f,g -> \x -> (f x, g x)
09:30:09 <bourbaki> esap: i need the cartesian product of course of all output nodes
09:30:10 <basti_> hmm
09:30:24 <basti_> where do you see a problem there?
09:30:26 <bourbaki> esap: i just need to take care of that kind of branches
09:30:48 <basti_> i dont see any as long as there is only one "end" node
09:30:56 <basti_> but maybe i'm blind.
09:31:05 <bourbaki> basti_: i cant make that then a single path i need to split from there on and get 2 new paths for that
09:31:14 <basti_> ah.
09:31:23 <bourbaki> if its just one path without branching in that direction its all ok
09:31:29 <basti_> hmm ok.
09:31:35 <bourbaki> that is i take the flows of functions of the dual of the graph
09:31:44 <basti_> what about functions returning a tuple?
09:31:58 <basti_> with only one input
09:32:07 <basti_> ar these "branches" too?
09:32:13 <bourbaki> that depends if its a tuple made of arrows
09:32:21 <basti_> hmm
09:32:27 <bourbaki> or if its a simple codomain
09:32:42 <basti_> you apparently thought a lot more about that.
09:32:44 <basti_> than i
09:33:03 <bourbaki> only if the product is made of codomains its considered a branch in my sense
09:33:13 <bourbaki> heh :) yes i did
09:33:17 <bourbaki> its for my thesis
09:33:29 <bourbaki> esap: got any ideas for that kind of stuff?
09:33:46 <esap> bourbaki: I'm still trying to understand the whole picture of it.
09:34:03 <bourbaki> esap: the idea is motivated from topology
09:34:14 <basti_> o.o
09:34:17 <bourbaki> where you can (i dont know the english term) crunsh spaces
09:34:32 <bourbaki> like equivalence classes
09:34:47 <esap> what is the marking for the nodes used for?
09:34:49 <bourbaki> i want to take a subgraph and make it one element of the graph
09:35:05 <bourbaki> nodes are domains and codomains of the arrows
09:36:04 <esap> bourbaki: Have you considered modelling the subgraphs with functors, and then computing a limit of the diagram?
09:36:34 <esap> bourbaki: functors represent subgraphs quite naturally.
09:36:40 <bourbaki> esap: hm no can you explain what you had in mind there?
09:36:56 <bourbaki> esap: why is that ?
09:37:04 <bourbaki> dang sec toilet
09:38:34 <bourbaki> bk]
09:38:36 <esap> bourbaki: A functor F : C -> D is a kind of subgraph ("diagram") in D such that you can index objects of the subgraph with objects of category C, and you can index arrows of subgraph with arrows in C.
09:39:33 <esap> bourbaki: A limit of the diagram represents the whole subgraph as an _object_ (not as a arrow).
09:39:57 <bourbaki> esap: ah i see ok ill read up on limits then thanks
09:40:44 <bourbaki> esap: and where does F map arrow that are not within the subgraph of D?
09:41:07 <esap> bourbaki: it doesn't, the functor only maps elements of C.
09:41:38 <bourbaki> esap: C is the over all graph?
09:42:02 <esap> bourbaki: No, C contains everything that's in the subgraph. But D can contain more than just the subgraph you want to describe.
09:42:39 <bourbaki> esap: ah ok so D is my complete graph
09:42:59 <esap> bourbaki: right, and C is the subgraph.
09:44:02 <bourbaki> esap: ok but i guess the limit of that functor is just something abstract right? i still would need to find a way to compute that limit right?
09:45:08 <esap> bourbaki: The limit of the functor has arrows to/from everything that the subgraph has arrows to/from.
09:45:30 <esap> bourbaki: so the limit is 'abstract' but it behaves like the subgraph.
09:46:50 <bourbaki> *think think think*
09:47:18 <esap> bourbaki: I
09:47:40 <esap> bourbaki: I think what you're after is very close to the limit, though I'm not sure if it's limit or colimit that you'll want to use.
09:47:54 <esap> bourbaki: It might easily be colimit.
09:48:09 <bourbaki> esap: ill defenetly will read on that but its cool that i can do that in CT
09:48:42 <bourbaki> esap: how does that codomain of the functior influence the limit or colimit of the functor?
09:49:18 <bourbaki> 4
09:49:29 <esap> bourbaki: the colimit defines the category in which the object exists.
09:49:56 <esap> bourbaki: s/colimit/codomain/
09:50:03 * esap mixes things up.
09:51:00 <esap> bourbaki: So given F : C -> D, there is an object lim F in D that represents the subgraph in D specified by C.
09:52:41 <bourbaki> ok and how is lim F different from C?
09:53:05 <esap> it's not, that's the point. You want 'lim F' to represent the subgraph.
09:53:18 <esap> Of course, it's in a different category.
09:53:49 <bourbaki> ok but there is no direct way to compute lim F
09:54:08 <bourbaki> id still need some idea how to do that engeneering wise
09:55:47 <esap> Read the definition of the limit. You'll basically need some representation for diagrams [subgraphs], or functors. A good representation depends on what you want to use the subgraphs for.
09:57:01 <bourbaki> ok ill do that thanks
09:57:26 <bourbaki> esap: do you think thats anything interesting or would you say its not worth the work?
09:59:01 <esap> bourbaki: Finding representation for functors? It is interesting (and probably worth the effort), though of course it depends on how badly you need it.
09:59:22 <bourbaki> esap: no i mean the overall idea
09:59:50 <bourbaki> esap: wont a simple function that maps grah surfice for a functor in that case?
10:02:04 <esap> bourbaki: well maybe it suffices. The functor law is useful when you want to understand the properties of the functors. It all depends on what kind of things you need. But category theory does represent subgraphs/diagrams with functors, so I see no reason not to follow that.
10:03:02 <esap> bourbaki: And since Haskell can easily represent functors, probably easy to build it with Haskell :-)
10:03:53 <esap> bourbaki: about the overall idea, I think it's a good idea, though I'd want to know more about what you use it for [it's pretty abstract as you've described it]
10:04:34 <bourbaki> i want to build something that you can represent algorithms with easyly
10:04:42 <bourbaki> for ai purposes
10:04:59 <esap> simply-typed lambda calculus? :-)
10:05:03 <bourbaki> and you can reason better about programs like that i guess
10:05:11 <tuomov> bourbaki: "crunch" space == quotient space?
10:05:12 <bourbaki> pardon :)?
10:05:17 <bourbaki> tuomov: yep
10:05:52 <bourbaki> tuomov: but it has another name in my topology book
10:06:03 * esap thinks lambda calculus is a good way to represent algorithms.
10:06:23 <bourbaki> esap: the idea is that you can see the structure of a program
10:06:48 <bourbaki> and its also very similar to automatons that way
10:07:02 <bourbaki> so you can build the union of 2 of these programs
10:07:29 <bourbaki> and with the help of topology you can glue programs together in any place
10:07:42 <bourbaki> not just concaternate two automatons
10:08:04 <bourbaki> esap: where can i read on that stuff of graphs and CT?
10:08:48 <esap> bourbaki: Think of the categorical diagrams as graphs, then any category theory intro will explain that.
10:09:17 <tuomov> I have yet to see a single good CT book online beyond the very basics..
10:09:20 <bourbaki> ah ok i see thats what i do aswell
10:09:59 <bourbaki> which is why i got interested in it in the first place
10:10:35 <esap> tuomov: "Toposes, triples and theories" is online http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/ttt.html
10:11:15 * esap wonders whether that counts as 'beyond the very basics'.
10:11:25 <tuomov> I started reading that last spring but quickly lost interest in it after chapter 1
10:12:26 <tuomov> after that there's very little motivation for the stuff in the text, imho
10:12:45 <tuomov> it's just theorems and proofs
10:14:40 <tuomov> "categories types and structures" is better at parts, but the typesettings sucks
10:14:44 <tuomov> -s
10:15:00 <bourbaki> tuomov: got a link to that paper?
10:15:54 <tuomov> google, first hit
10:16:04 <esap> Practical foundations of mathematics has some things as well. http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/
10:16:54 <tuomov> I've never really had to time properly study CT, though
10:17:21 <tuomov> I've started reading on it at least three times but then quickly got deviated
10:18:13 <bourbaki> for me its hard to grasp it really without a maybe coherent example
10:18:39 * esap suggests "Categorical primer" (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/487012.html)
10:19:08 <bourbaki> as my algebra prof said often "you are on the very edge to do abstract nonsence quickly"
10:19:26 * esap also suggests "Categorical manifesto" http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/goguen91categorical.html [these are the basic stuff though].
10:19:31 <tuomov> it may be abstract, and it may be nonsense, but it is cool
10:19:52 <bourbaki> neither me nor he thinks its nonsense
10:20:17 <bourbaki> but sometimes you tend to abstract so much that you dont know what youre doing anymore
10:20:48 <bourbaki> esap: another idea of that subgraph collapseing is to be able to zoom in and out of my programs
10:21:02 <bourbaki> i still need to build an editor for that stuff :(
10:21:05 <tuomov> that's when it get unintresting, when it has no connections with reality anymore
10:21:12 <esap> right, that's sometimes a problem. The important thing is to ensure that what you don't abstract away important things. Abstraction is intended to hide _unimportant_ details, not the essentials.
10:21:26 <tuomov> (abstract) maths is nice as long as it there's some applications in sight
10:21:43 <tuomov> -typos
10:21:49 <bourbaki> esap: yep true but to understand it you have to keep in touch with the real world to understand what your doing
10:22:22 <bourbaki> otherwise its just math of maths sake :) not that thats a bad thing
10:22:26 <esap> bourbaki: True. It's very easy to think something is not important when leaving it out would break everything.
10:23:37 * esap is used to OO, which also uses abstraction heavily, so maybe I'm thinking it's easier than it really is :-)
10:24:07 <bourbaki> :)
10:24:50 <bourbaki> ok i think its time for a pizza :)
10:24:55 <tuomov> you can abstract as much as you want as long as you know the connections to something concrete
10:25:16 <esap> everything that's not abstract is a connection to something concrete :-)
10:25:16 <tuomov> the problem is when that abstract thing comes a subject of study in itself and loses the connection
10:25:18 <bourbaki> thats what i also think and thats what i think my prof wanted to state also
10:25:51 <tuomov> and I think that's to a large degree happened to modern mathematics
10:26:24 <tuomov> people just study the maths without any motivation for it besides doing maths
10:26:29 <esap> tuomov: Mathematics is actually intended to be independent of its applications.
10:27:05 <tuomov> all maths has been developed from an applied perspective initially
10:28:20 <esap> tuomov: True, but keeping things independent will also bring the benefit that you can then apply the same results to multiple different purposes. If you bind too much to one application, then you lose reusability of the results.
10:28:43 <tuomov> yes, that's abstraction, and I'm not arguing against it
10:29:24 <tuomov> what I'm trying to say is, what's the point in studying something that you know no applications for?
10:30:42 <tuomov> at least I'd like to have that thin string to reality while dwelling in an abstract space
10:30:47 <esap> Actually it's very hard to find any branch of mathematics that wouldn't have more than a dozen applications that they can be used for.
10:31:16 <esap> Not that it would be obvious from the papers though :-)
10:31:44 <tuomov> branches yes, and initially when a branch is new (now when has that last happened?) there's a connection
10:32:09 <tuomov> but once almost everything sensible has been studied, the problems become totally irrelevant
10:32:35 <tuomov> except for the few remaining difficult problems, of course
10:32:49 <esap> The connection isn't lost, what happens is that the problems that you solve are so difficult that people would never even attempt to solve them in practice.
10:32:56 <Philippa> which may turn out to be surprisingly parallel to the remaining difficult practical problems
10:33:11 <Philippa> monads and arrows seem to have a link to aspect-oriented programming, if you want an example
10:33:28 <Philippa> esap: until somebody has cause to :-)
10:33:32 <tuomov> monads and arrows are very basic stuff..
10:33:53 <esap> philippa: But you never have the cause in practical applications [they usually have a time schedule, which prevents that]
10:33:57 <Philippa> but they arose out of some fairly serious studies in semantics
10:34:05 <Philippa> esap: you mean you don't have the time to and bodge it, that's not the same thing
10:34:20 <Philippa> or rather, their applications in FP etc etc did
10:35:16 * esap doesn't have time schedule in any serious mathematics I do.
10:35:56 * esap wonders whether my random thoughts can be considered mathematics though :-)
10:36:01 <Philippa> heh
10:38:30 * esap has to go get some pizza as well.
10:41:21 <dustin`> How does one memoize in Haskell?
10:42:19 <kristnjov> you mean like in a global variable? ;P
10:42:21 <Lemmih> You remember computed values so you don't have to recompute them.
10:42:33 <CosmicRay> memoize?
10:42:38 <CosmicRay> what does memoize mean?
10:42:51 <kristnjov> well, gee CosmicRay, it wasn't a typo or anything
10:43:14 <Lemmih> dustin`: The fib example is pretty good.
10:43:20 <CosmicRay> well I don't know what memorize means in terms of a language either
10:43:38 <dustin`> Lemmih: I'm afraid I had some trouble with that one...
10:43:43 <kristnjov> i'd bet you could figure out though
10:43:59 <Lemmih> dustin`: What kind of trouble?
10:44:33 <dustin`> Lemmih: The syntax [0 ..] I have not encountered yet, nor have I encountered !!
10:45:33 <dustin`> Lemmih: I've been looking through the references I have, but neither seem to have some kind of quick reference to find syntax like that.
10:46:09 <Lemmih> '[1,2,3] !! 0' evaluates to '1' and '[0..]' creates an infinite list.
10:46:26 <Lemmih> dustin`: An interpreter is really good to test such things.
10:46:43 <kristnjov> [1..5] would create the list [1,2,3,4,5]
10:46:48 <kristnjov> so you can see where [0..] comes from
10:47:06 <dustin`> Ahh okay!  Let me look at that example again...
10:49:04 <Lemmih> enumFrom 0 == [0 ..]
10:49:48 <dustin`> So the function will return some other function that will take the lazy list and use the !! operator to fetch a fibonacci number...
10:50:10 <dustin`> With the recursive call, isn't a new lazy list created?
10:51:52 <Lemmih> What are you looking at?
10:52:19 <dustin`> http://www.ai.mit.edu/%7Egregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg04253.html
10:55:23 <musasabi> that has partial applications so it may look weird.
10:55:23 <Lemmih> dustin`: The list is created by mapping fib' over an infinite list.
10:55:25 <crackhead> big question
10:55:52 <musasabi> lets start from the simple details.
10:55:54 <crackhead> if I have a file "foo.hs"...how do I include it in file "bar.hs"
10:56:14 <musasabi> fib' is simple fibonacci.
10:56:27 <dustin`> musasabi: Okay...
10:56:30 <Lemmih> crackhead: import Foo
10:56:49 <musasabi> [0..] = is the infinite list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...]
10:57:24 <musasabi> map fib' [0 ..] = is the list of all fibonacci values from 0 to n.
10:58:04 <musasabi> (map fib' [0..]) !! n = the nth fibonacci number
10:58:40 <musasabi> fib = ((map fib' [0 ..]) !!) :: Int -> Int = function taking an int and using it to index the fibonacci number list.
10:59:12 <dustin`> musasabi: Okay.. very straightforward...  I'm having a difficult time seeing the memoization, since it seems like every call to fib creates a new list (without the old results)
10:59:19 <musasabi> now look at the definition of fib' - it actually uses fib which remembers already computed values - to perform the lookup.
11:00:36 <crackhead> Lemmih :that didn't work
11:00:49 <musasabi> dustin`: no, it remembers it.
11:01:26 <musasabi> it is quite feasable to calculate e.g. fib 10000 with that implementation (at least in ghci)
11:02:34 <Lemmih> crackhead: What did you name the module in foo.hs?
11:03:13 <dustin`> musasabi: Okay, I think I see it now... We make fib equal to ((map fib' [0 ..]) !!), then every invocation of fib uses the same list
11:03:39 <Lemmih> crackhead: You should name it Foo.
11:03:44 <dustin`> musasabi: Can you do similar tricks with any binary operator?
11:03:56 <musasabi> dustin`: yes, that's how it works.
11:04:33 <musasabi> dustin`: fib is not binary, for a binary operator you would need a matrix.
11:05:39 <dustin`> musasabi: I meant the   fib = ((map fib' [0 ..]) !!) part.... The binary operator I was speaking of is the !!
11:05:59 <dustin`> musasabi: Though it makes sense, since you would expect !! to curry just like anything else.
11:06:15 <musasabi> in that sense, yes it should be possible.
11:16:42 <sorje> Is it possible to access MS access databases and MS excel spreadsheets from haskell?
11:18:06 <Cale> http://php.cin.ufpe.br/~haskell/haskelldotnet/hsharp.php?m=home#releases -- perhaps if this project is successful.. not sure if there are any ways presently.
11:18:14 <stepcut> gah, this site has, like, 50 usb 2.0 pci cards, how should I pick the "best" one :-{
11:19:29 <Cale> stepcut: could it really matter that much?
11:19:35 <sorje> Hm, okay. Thanks.
11:19:56 <Cale> sorje: well, there's the Haskell FFI
11:20:26 <Cale> so if there's a C library which interfaces with MS Access and Excel spreadsheets, then certainly you can get at it from Haskell code.
11:20:49 <Cale> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ffi/
11:21:21 <stepcut> Cale: that's what I want to know, is the $23 koutech pci-usb card, really any better than the $11 via one ?
11:22:05 <stepcut> actually after shipping it's $26 vs $17
11:22:06 <Cale> stepcut: probably there's not much of a difference, and if there is, it's only $20
11:22:51 <basti|_> uhm
11:22:53 <Cale> I can't see you running into problems with one or the other.
11:22:59 <basti|_> @ghostbusters basti_
11:22:59 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "ghostbusters", try "lambdabot: @listcommands
11:23:19 <stepcut> maybe the via will be more likely to have linux/bsd support... :-/
11:23:48 <Cale> I've found that USB in linux "just works".
11:24:09 <Cale> But it's not like I've tested hundreds of devices or anything.
11:24:51 <stepcut> hrm, I should ask the guy who works here and has :)
11:25:48 <tuomov> I only have good experiences with usb too
11:25:58 <musasabi> stepcut: check whether they have good or poor drivers (if you are using linux).
11:26:01 <tuomov> standard controllers, whoa!
11:26:13 <tuomov> no need to hunt for the correct driver
11:26:36 <Cale> So long as you're using a moderately recent kernel, there are no problems. All the controllers fall into one of a few types, which are all supported.
11:27:14 <stepcut> ok, he claims he has never seen a usb controller that did not work
11:29:21 <Cale> Yeah, they're either OHCI or UHCI apparently. If you have modules (or compiled in support) for both, then you ought to be fine.
11:29:29 <stepcut> ECHI
11:29:38 <stepcut> r, EHCI
11:29:56 * basti|_ .o ( ACHOO )
11:30:19 <Cale> yeah, that too :)
11:30:28 <Cale> it's available in all 2.6 and some 2.4 kernels
11:30:35 <basti_> turtle porn on german TV.
11:30:46 <stepcut> well, I am going to install the card in a win2k box anyway :)
11:31:21 <stepcut> but in a few years, I might turn that machine into a linux box
11:32:45 <Cale> now I just wish that ATI would hurry up and release new linux drivers that work with doom 3 :)
11:32:49 <CosmicRay> stupid haskell question time:  how do I do printf("%3.5f", afloatvar) in Haskell?
11:33:21 <CosmicRay> similar question for similar formats, such as: "%0.3f", "%-3s", etc.
11:33:25 <Cale> http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/numeric.html
11:33:44 <Cale> those might be useful
11:34:06 <CosmicRay> ah.
11:34:12 <CosmicRay> yes, those will do part of it.
11:35:14 <Cale> http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/ian.lynagh/Printf/ :)
11:35:16 <CosmicRay> haskell is the first language I've used in a long time that has no equivolent of printf
11:35:29 <CosmicRay> oh sure, prove me wrong with lightning speed :-)
11:35:48 <Cale> printf is tricky because its type is data dependent
11:35:56 <CosmicRay> yes
11:36:03 <CosmicRay> ocaml gets around that by a compiler kludge
11:36:15 <CosmicRay> it converts the format string to some weird Format4 value at compile time
11:36:28 <CosmicRay> looks liek this is much the same idea, just at a little different point on the compile
11:37:19 <mattam> Cale: doom 3 is available on linux ?
11:37:24 <Cale> mattam: yep
11:37:31 <mattam> yoohooo
11:37:44 <Cale> It's been out for about a week or two
11:37:46 <mattam> my windows disk died last week :(
11:37:47 <CosmicRay> how well supported is template haskell?  do hugs and nhc98 support it?
11:37:57 <CosmicRay> mattam: at least all the spyware died with it :-)
11:38:12 <Cale> http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/doom/
11:38:31 <Cale> CosmicRay: I'm not sure -- I only use ghc and ghci :)
11:38:32 <mattam> and some VC++ code, i can't say that's bad indeed
11:38:47 <mattam> but i had some savegames of doom3 in Nightmare mode too
11:38:51 <CosmicRay> Cale: well then, only the built-in Microsoft spyware :-)
11:39:28 <Cale> that was probably intended for mattam :)
11:40:08 <stepcut> CosmicRay: I think only ghc supports template haskell, though there might be some out of date pre-processors that generate H98 code
11:40:18 <stepcut> CosmicRay: template haskell is still changing a lot
11:40:24 <Cale> I like how the haskell interpreter is the first hit you get from google for "hugs"
11:40:27 <CosmicRay> hey Igloo: care to package your Printf thingy for Debian?
11:40:33 <mattam> only Firefox and doom3 running, so not much spyware
11:41:45 <Cale> mattam: what brand of video card do you have?
11:41:50 <mattam> nvidia
11:41:53 <Cale> good :)
11:42:21 <mattam> i despise ATI for thei linux "support"
11:42:21 <Cale> well, good in the sense that the NVidia linux drivers currently work with doom3
11:42:25 <Cale> yeah
11:42:40 <CosmicRay> mattam: who has better support?
11:42:45 <CosmicRay> certainly not nvidia
11:42:55 <Cale> I just got a 9800, and have been sorely disappointed by ATI's driver support compared with NVidia's.
11:43:02 * CosmicRay has recently had hassles with both of them
11:43:18 <Cale> NVidia's drivers at least have a proper installer/updater.
11:43:18 <CosmicRay> nvidia's own drivers have generally been rather flaky
11:43:33 <mattam> well, in practice i never had any problem with my nvidia's but got some with the (one) ATI i had before and the ATI board on my iBook
11:43:43 <CosmicRay> I juse use the fglrx debs
11:44:02 <CosmicRay> and at least with ATI there are two other viable choices for many situations
11:44:09 <CosmicRay> (dri trunk and gatos)
11:44:28 <Cale> I seem to be having lots of trouble with flickering -- perhaps Z-ordering problems.
11:44:38 <mattam> nv works too
11:45:00 <Cale> celestia doesn't work very well with the new ATI card.
11:46:08 <Cale> doom3 runs, but messes up after about 5-10 minutes of playing with geometry and texture problems.
11:46:17 <Cale> (and then freezes)
11:46:33 <CosmicRay> I've had a lot of trouble with nvidia's TV out
11:46:51 <Cale> I have TV out, but have no idea why I'd ever want to use it :)
11:46:58 <CosmicRay> Cale: www.mythtv.org
11:47:37 <Cale> LCD is so much clearer
11:47:40 <CosmicRay> I got an old Radeon 9200SE.  works so much nicer than the nvidia
11:47:53 <kristnjov> i'm using my old shotgun geforce2 pro :)
11:48:07 <CosmicRay> Cale: Yes, well for the price of our 32" HDTV CRT, we could have gotten about a 17" HDTV LCD :-)
11:48:30 <CosmicRay> my vision is not good enough to appreciate the LCD clarity on a 17" TV from across the room :-)
11:48:38 <Cale> Eh, sit closer :)
11:48:48 <CosmicRay> heh
11:49:09 <CosmicRay> actually our CRT has HDMI in, which is pin-compatible with DVI-D
11:49:40 <CosmicRay> the problem is that the TV then goes into its precise color rendering mode
11:50:04 <CosmicRay> which means, essentially, that some programs show up very bright with way too much color, and others lack color, etc.
11:50:28 <CosmicRay> normal tvs are not precise enough to show the difference
11:50:33 <CosmicRay> or at least that's how it was explained to me
11:50:42 <CosmicRay> that's why watching TV on a computer monitor also looks like crap
11:51:06 <CosmicRay> and we don't yet have enough HDTV or pure digital content to make it worth the pain on the analog stuff
11:51:55 <Cale> http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/ does a bunch of processing to fix this, even though there are cases where it gets it wrong.
11:52:25 <CosmicRay> yeah
11:52:31 <CosmicRay> I have used tvtime with my old wintv card
11:52:35 <CosmicRay> and it does indeed do a good job
11:52:40 <CosmicRay> esp. with deinterlacing
11:52:47 <CosmicRay> though for the color/contrast stuff, it doesn't do as good a job
11:52:53 <Cale> I sort of know the person who wrote it :)
11:52:57 <CosmicRay> really
11:52:58 <CosmicRay> cool
11:53:07 <CosmicRay> care to merge its technology into mythfrontend? :-)
11:53:15 <Cale> he hangs out in #csc here (Waterloo CS club)
11:53:27 <CosmicRay> deinterlacing has long been a sore spot there
11:53:54 <CosmicRay> afaik tvtime only works with a live video4linux signal, and cannot be used for MPEG2 or MPEG4 playback as it's presently written
11:54:21 <CosmicRay> many mythtv setups use the PVR250 or PVR350 cards, which have a hardware MPEG2 encoder
11:54:28 <CosmicRay> mythtv just streams that to disk then
11:54:35 <CosmicRay> so the signal processing has to happen at playback time
11:54:46 <Cale> I wish I knew why celestia looks so messed up with my ATI card. If I could fix that, I bet a lot of other small artifacts I've seen would go away.
11:59:22 <mattam> tvtime is good :) real quality software.
11:59:45 <mattam> hmmm, i only have CD 1 of 3 of my doom3 copy :(
12:02:59 <bourbaki> doom3? why dont you play something good?
12:06:07 <mattam> like ?
12:06:52 <bourbaki> nwn
12:08:18 <mattam> anyway i'm not 'playing', i'm just having a distressing yet de-stressing time
12:09:15 <mattam> and it's a good game, it's the first one where i'm terrified sometimes
12:10:28 <tuomov> It was "fun" for a while but quickly got too repetitive
12:11:15 <mattam> it is, but in Nightmare mode it becomes hard too
12:11:34 <mattam> i still whish there was a good multiplayer mode
12:12:42 <mattam> anyway, with 2 cds missing i can't expect to play tonight so i'll work instead, and maybe hack some haskell (now OnT :)
12:12:58 <bourbaki> hm
12:13:38 <bourbaki> well i need to go to bed
12:13:42 <bourbaki> nighto
13:12:46 <crackhead> could someone tell me how to redefine the (+) operator?
13:13:41 <Igloo> x + y = x * y
13:18:19 <ibid> well, you probably need to hide Prelude.+ first
13:23:00 <crackhead> I just want to do it inside of one definition
13:23:37 <Lemmih> crackhead: Why not call it something else than (+)?

14:02:31 <Jan_w> pff, nice and quiet here
14:41:14 <yohan> anyone here heard of john hughes?
14:46:19 <Lor> You mean like, recently? Something happened to him?
14:53:14 <yohan> no im just wondering what he's famous for
14:53:17 <yohan> and stuff, if he is :)
14:53:27 <monochrom> functional programming he is famous for.
14:53:34 <yohan> cause hes our teacher
14:53:36 <yohan> oh cool
14:53:47 <yohan> did he have something to do with the crafting of haskell in particular?
14:54:02 <monochrom> yes
14:54:23 <yohan> nice
14:55:08 <yohan> i wonder if haskell is the future
15:01:55 <monochrom> probably F# has a brighter future.  but doesn't hurt to know haskell.  lazy list is a useful idea.
15:02:50 <monochrom> All those "generator" things in python are just to mimic lazy lists nicely in a non-lazy language.  If you know haskell, you find python generators obvious.
15:04:42 <yohan> ah hehe
15:04:57 <yohan> F#, havnt heard about that...is it bigger than haskell? and funktional?
15:05:23 <monochrom> F# is a .net language.
15:06:10 <yohan> aha, do you mean C#?
15:07:29 <yohan> hm readin about it now...heh sounds like microsoft wants to get their hands on the funktional concept as well as tryin to copy java
15:08:17 <monochrom> I mean F#.  It is a functional language.
15:09:19 <yohan> seems to be a mix of imperativ/funktional
15:09:39 <tuomov> subset of ocaml with .net crap
15:09:42 <monochrom> it copies from ocaml
15:10:06 <monochrom> a bit of imperativeness doesn't hurt. you will use it for good purposes not bad purposes.
15:10:37 <jesse99> destroys referential trans tho
15:10:47 <Jan_w> why can't haskell tell me which argument an error is for  ?
15:10:52 <yohan> oh k
15:11:12 <Jan_w> it states the type ofcourse, but not the position
15:12:08 <tuomov> I guess it depends on the type of the error?
15:12:23 <monochrom> I guess it depends on which haskell.
15:12:29 <tuomov> that too
15:12:38 <monochrom> ghc tells me everything.
15:12:42 <Jan_w> does it?
15:12:44 <Jan_w> trying
15:14:19 <Jan_w> hm, indeed, never realized hugs for win32 would give different errors vc ghc
15:14:27 <Jan_w> compared to ghc
15:14:53 <Jan_w> but ghc's errors are certainly much clearly
15:14:59 <tromp> with some haskell hurus working for microsoft, you'd think they'd derive from haskell rather than ocaml
15:15:05 <tromp> gurus that is:)
15:15:37 <tromp> or do they have equal amounts of ocaml gurus?
17:15:20 <Jan_w> whats wrong with:
17:15:20 <Jan_w> unwrap :: [[a]] -> [a]
17:15:20 <Jan_w> unwrap x:xs 
17:15:20 <Jan_w>  | xs == []  	= [x]
17:15:20 <Jan_w>  | otherwise 	= [x] ++ (unwrap xs)
17:15:41 <SyntaxNinja> you want parens around (x:xs)
17:15:45 <monochrom> where is unwrap [] ?
17:15:56 <Jan_w> ah
17:18:15 <Jan_w> man i'm tired, i should get some sleep, i brain stopped working :)
17:18:35 <Jan_w> i=my
17:20:08 <SyntaxNinja> hehe
17:21:09 * Igloo looks perplexed at some code
17:21:47 * SyntaxNinja hopes it's not mine
17:21:48 <Jan_w> goodnight all
17:21:56 <Igloo> No, mine
17:22:13 <SyntaxNinja> 'night Jan_w
17:22:28 <Igloo> Hmm, I think I might just be missing a glClear or something, and it's reusing the buffer from the previous app. But even that doesn't really make sense to me.
17:23:44 <Igloo> Ah, yes, the clear was in the function I'd commented out. OK, universe, I forgive you...mostly
17:29:17 <Jan_w> pff, damn, i more thing, can't get it out of my mind :) how can I filter all elements from [b] out of [a] ?
17:29:44 <Igloo> Do they appear only once?
17:29:56 <Jan_w> yes
17:30:17 <Igloo> List.\\
17:30:43 <Jan_w> all right
17:30:56 <Jan_w> then this should work, hmmm
17:33:23 <Jan_w> so [a]\\[b] gives me [a] without the elements that also occur in [b] ?
17:40:17 <Igloo> Right
17:41:27 <Igloo> Hmm, how can I get the smallest float bigger than x?
17:41:53 <monochrom> x
17:42:19 <Lemmih> Hello flori
17:43:06 <Igloo> Not even floats are such that x > x...
18:33:41 <yome> Hi
18:34:12 <yome> Say I'd like to have a function that could either receive a lonely value (for example the number '42') or a list of numbers.
18:34:30 <yome> How would I do that?
18:34:36 * yome isn't used to static typing...
18:36:41 <yome> Related to it, what I'm trying to do is convert a 'tree' built using a datatype to a tree built using builtin tuples...
18:38:40 <emu> yome: you would use a disjoint type
18:38:58 <yome> emu, cool.  I'll look for documentation about that.
18:39:27 <emu> data foo = NUM Int | LIST [Int] or something like taht
18:39:39 <emu> then, NUM 1 constructs a foo, and LIST [1] also does
18:39:54 <emu> and you can pattern match to deconstruct
18:39:59 <yome> emu, nice.  I suspected I had to do something like that.
18:40:13 <yome> This will probably sounds naive, but couldn'
18:40:16 <yome> oops
18:40:23 <yome> couldn't that disjoint type be inferred?
18:40:39 <yome> Or that would void all that static typing is trying to provide...
18:41:42 <emu> i've thought of that too
18:41:54 <emu> but it leads to undecidable type inference
18:42:07 <yome> Ah, you mean you could not say if the inference will terminate?
18:42:11 <emu> at the very least
18:42:22 <Etaoin> rather than making a type, couldn't you just use a list of numbers?
18:42:59 <Etaoin> I mean use a list instead of the disjoin type
22:18:47 <yome> Hey, how would one implement 'letrec' in a purely functional language?
22:19:12 <yome> I'm writing a toy Scheme interpreter, but wondering how to implement 'letrec'...
22:19:54 <yome> Usually I'd just add 'unbound' variables to the env, and fix them later, but that obviously won't work here.
22:20:03 <ez4> i used a monad, but i was very unhappy with having to do that
22:20:34 <yome> There has to be an easier way...
22:21:33 <ez4> i've seen letrec defined using a fix operator
22:21:56 <yome> You mean like Y or something?
22:21:59 <ez4> yeah
22:22:08 <yome> Mmm.
22:26:41 <yome> Another thing I'm wondering is what type to give to builtin primitives.
22:29:46 <ez4> you could make all procedures actual haskell functions that take a list of args as input and produce a val as output
22:30:03 <ez4> then primitives just work like any other procedure
22:30:28 <yome> ez4, good idea.  I was trying to go for 'fixed' arity for the builtins.  Makes much more sense like that.
22:31:08 <squire> are type classes in any way related to OO classes?
22:31:39 <tuomov> not as such
22:31:54 <tuomov> I'd say java's interfaces are close, but I have never really programmed in java..
22:32:42 <squire> I thought so too
22:33:08 <squire> but there *is* a relation, in that interfaces are a hack to avoid multiple inheritence (so I heard)
22:33:27 <tuomov> yes
22:34:05 <squire> so the Eq class is like C#'s IComparable, I guess
22:34:30 <tuomov> I don't know any C# (and I don't think I want to..)
22:35:08 <squire> me niether :) (especially after Haskell)
22:35:28 <tuomov> the language might be ok, but the standard libraries must be one horror
22:35:46 <tuomov> given what other m$ apis are
22:36:03 <squire> simply unimaginable bloat, I say
22:37:50 <squire> why isn't it possible to define an equation at the REPL?
22:38:27 <ez4> yome, i have a solution for letrec
22:38:48 <yome> Cool!  I'm listening :)
22:39:24 <ez4> ok, i'm typing it up
22:48:12 * yome will be right back
22:53:29 * yome is back
22:53:32 <ez4> now i'm trying to optimize the thing for haskell
22:53:40 <yome> ez4, can you point me to where you found it?
22:54:00 <ez4> it's in the book Compiling with Continuations
22:54:41 <yome> Ah ok. Too bad I don't have it...
22:57:18 <yome> ez4, can you give me the general idea?
22:58:09 <ez4> woot!  done
22:58:22 <ez4> what's the best place to paste haskell code?
22:58:28 <yome> I don't know.
22:59:03 <ez4> http://paste.lisp.org/display/3106
22:59:14 <yome> Cool.
22:59:36 <ez4> I can't promise this code will work because i haven't run it
23:01:01 <ez4> but very simply we take advantage of haskell's laziness and mutual recursion to define env1 and use that in the definition of each procedure at the same time :)
23:01:04 <ez4> very, very simple
23:01:19 <yome> Yeah, pretty sweet.
23:02:10 <yome> So the key to letrec is to use letrec :)
23:02:28 <yome> Or rather 'let', as it is knows in Haskell.
23:02:28 <ez4> exactly
23:02:33 <yome> s/knows/known/
23:38:34 <musasabi> morning
23:57:30 <kristnjov> hey, how do i declare a generator for lists?
23:57:44 <kristnjov> listSorted :: Gen a => a -> a
23:57:48 <kristnjov> that doesn't work
