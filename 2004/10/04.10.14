00:00:47 <dons> hmm. maybe wchar.h isn't is scope?
00:01:12 <tuomov> no, that's in ncursesw.h
00:01:17 <tuomov> and it should all be included ok
00:01:18 <musasabi> tuomov: that is propably from a "foreign import" and without the correct inline.
00:02:20 <tuomov> it used to work..
00:02:45 <dons> maybe because we switched to -fvia-C ?
00:03:26 <dons> try using -fasm, it will probably turn the warning off
00:03:33 <tuomov> -fvia-C and -O both trigger it
00:03:42 <tuomov> -O implies -fvia-C?
00:03:45 <dons> yes
00:04:08 <tuomov> well, I guess it is not a big problem
00:04:19 <tuomov> but apparently ghc is not doing everything right there
00:04:25 <dons> it can usually be solved by getting the right include into scope
00:05:35 <shapr> dons: http://lists.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/post-emacs
00:07:24 <dons> ah ha!
00:16:22 <shapr> post-emacs: archives aren't generated yet, there is a gmane.org subscription, and subscription replies should go to lists.scannedinavian.org (but occasionally mail clients send to just scannedinavian.org, not sure why).
00:41:42 <shapr> gutentag olleruste454 
00:41:59 <shapr> oh, gotta go to class
00:42:01 * shapr disappears
00:50:26 <tuomov> dns: hs-plugins support is now in the mainstream riot repo
00:50:31 <tuomov> s/dns/dons/
00:52:21 <dons> cool :)
00:57:44 <dons> tuomov: a snapshot release of hs-plugins has been made. it's on the download page. 
00:58:04 <dons> it would be suitable to recommend to riot users
00:58:45 <dons> hs-plugins-20041014-heatwave.tar.gz
00:59:38 <tuomov> ok, I'll update the link in the README and Makefile
01:00:51 <juhp> what is riot btw?
01:01:18 <tuomov> http://iki.fi/tuomov/riot/
01:11:57 <juhp> tuomov: have you tried the "planner" and "remember" cousins of emacs-wiki btw? :)
01:12:14 * juhp hasn't used them to speak of...
01:12:28 <tuomov> I don't like emacs..
01:18:24 <juhp> tuomov: :)
01:18:49 <tuomov> I've used joe-like bindings since '95 and am totally handicapped without them
01:19:14 <tuomov> and configuring emacs to work like you would be at least a thousand lines of lisp.. no thanks
01:19:21 <tuomov> s/you/joe/
01:20:03 <tuomov> so atm I use jed with a wordstar mode modified to be more like joe (joe bindings are a kind of emacs/wordstar hybrid)
01:20:18 <tuomov> because jed was easier to customise
01:20:38 <tuomov> and has a less clunky feeling to it too, and is fully functional in tty mode
01:21:04 <tuomov> however, jed development is almost non-existent and there would still be lots of things to fix...
01:26:50 <tuomov> mainly to do with syntax highlighting and language modes... plus jed not supporting is the only thing keeping me from switching to it
01:26:57 <tuomov> supporting utf-8 that is
01:37:18 <musasabi> dons: Is there any trick in installing hs-plugins? ./configure + make + make install does not seem to register it for ghc.
01:38:21 <tuomov> you must manually register it. how to do so should be mentioned in the readme
01:38:52 <tuomov> perhaps this should be done automatically, disablable with some option..
01:48:28 <musasabi> hmm found it. stumbled upon the addDLL problem, maybe using the cvs-snapshot will help.
01:58:25 <musasabi> plugs> 1 + 1
01:58:25 <musasabi> 0
02:46:31 <juhp> tuomov: fwiw as a packager I prefer it not to be installed by default
03:18:16 <Muad_Dib> hii
03:18:36 <TheHunter> morning, Muad_Dib 
03:18:44 <Muad_Dib> i just noticed there is even a irc bot in haskell :)
03:19:02 <TheHunter> sure there is, haskell is a great language.
03:19:16 <TheHunter> @hello
03:19:16 <Muad_Dib> :D :D
03:19:17 <lambdabot> Hello world. 
03:19:25 <Lemmih> (-:
03:19:31 <Muad_Dib> what does it require to run on?
03:19:33 <Lemmih> Good morning, #haskell.
03:20:35 <TheHunter> i guess it runs almost anywhere.
03:21:08 <Muad_Dib> well, i read the readme on the http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/hlibs/lambdabot/ site, and it sais i need to do make :P
03:21:16 <Muad_Dib> but obviously i dont have make on a windows pc
03:21:27 <Muad_Dib> and on my gentoo-amd64 both hugs and ghc dont want to run :P
03:22:58 <TheHunter> hmm, cygwin should give you make
03:23:05 <TheHunter> sorry about your gentoo box.
03:23:14 <Muad_Dib> hehe
03:23:34 <Muad_Dib> well yeah, its a shame :P
03:24:01 <TheHunter> i thought amd64 was backwards-compatible.
03:24:16 <Muad_Dib> well yeah and no :P
03:26:33 <Muad_Dib> so i guess the bot cannot be run by a simple hugs ? :P
03:27:47 <TheHunter> it's worth a shot, but depends on how many ghc extesions lambdabot uses
03:28:47 <Muad_Dib> pfft :P there is no archive on the site :P
05:16:45 <Igloo> Anyone know how Flippi talks to the web?
05:18:15 <musasabi> Is there a combinator that will work like: firstM = foldl mplus mzero 
05:18:33 <Philippa> Igloo: Network.CGI
05:19:06 <Igloo> Philippa: So apache is just running it as a CGI binary, loading it every time?
05:19:10 <Philippa> yep
05:20:42 <Philippa> (on phone, can talk more in a mo)
05:21:26 * Igloo isn't really interested beyond that, was just curious  :-)
05:21:34 <Philippa> heh
05:21:58 <shapr> Muad_Dib: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/lbot2.1.tgz
05:22:06 <shapr> that shoud help some
05:23:15 <Philippa_> Igloo: assuming it runs under hugs you could do things that way, any hacks you can find to speed things up are good, but yeah. Just a plain CGI executable for now.
05:23:21 <musasabi> I have some very primitive appserver code if you are interested.
05:23:35 <Philippa_> Not My Problem for now
05:23:44 <Philippa_> maybe in a while - I'm kinda knackered right now :-)
05:24:00 <Igloo> :-)
05:24:30 <Philippa> really I just wanted a wiki clone for my SO and I to organise our lives with at some point. Did it in Haskell because hey, easiest for me to work with.
05:24:45 <Igloo> *nod*
05:28:11 <Philippa> but yeah, if it's of interest to anybody, cool. I'd like to think it's at least fairly easy to hack on
05:32:06 <bourbaki> moin
05:32:08 <shapr> y0
05:32:20 <bourbaki> i found someone for the editor :)
05:32:55 <shapr> yay
05:33:26 <bourbaki> he also did some stuff for fraunhofer with some gui things
05:33:35 <shapr> whoa, neat
05:33:55 <bourbaki> yep and hes interested in hci things so we might as well implement some other things
05:35:00 <juhp> Philippa: thanks for flippa :-)   btw the tar.gz link points to the zip file too
05:35:13 <Philippa> it does? Crap, gimme a mo...
05:35:50 <juhp> no worries - I already grabbed the tarball :)
05:36:02 <Philippa> that'll teach me to rape'n'paste :-)
05:36:12 <shapr> I'm responsible for the tarball, so if it doesn't work, bug me.
05:36:46 <Philippa> OK, fixed
05:37:02 <juhp> Philippa,shapr: ok, thanks
05:38:22 <shapr> or maybe irresponsible...
05:44:25 <shapr> hej, have you guys looked at Tutorial D?
05:44:31 <shapr> doh, I meant "hey"
05:44:43 <bourbaki> tutorial d?
05:44:46 * shapr gives in to the swedish side of the force.
05:44:55 <shapr> http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/316
05:54:06 <dons> musasabi: addDLL is a problem in ghc's rts Linker.c. It is fixed in ghc-6.2.2
05:54:18 <shapr> g'day dons 
05:54:20 <dons> it happens when you try to dynamically load the dynamic loader (i.e. in ghci for example)
05:54:23 <dons> hey shapr
05:57:16 <shapr> oh dons, I was thinking about python vs ghci, and then hs-plugins
05:57:47 <dons> ooh. what were you thinking?
05:58:01 <shapr> In python, everything happens at runtime. In ghci, there's lots of stuff you can't do that works just fine in a file.
05:58:27 <shapr> That seems to be a common newbie problem, they expect text from Foo.hs to work the same interactively.
05:58:52 <dons> oh, like data decls or instances?
05:58:56 <shapr> right
05:59:45 <dons> hmm. this may be just a design feature of ghci .. as a do-prompt
06:00:14 <shapr> newbies learn better if they can interactively play with the same stuff that works from/in a file.
06:00:28 <shapr> At least, that's my experience.
06:00:54 <dons> interesting -- we can do these things at runtime with hs-plugins, I think
06:01:19 <shapr> I thought so, was just wondering if it would be a not so exciting but terribly useful application of hs-plugins.
06:01:29 <dons> since it is just like loading a file into ghci that has the code written into it
06:01:54 <dons> no, ive had suggestions from other people about runtime-extended instances, for example
06:02:12 <shapr> like what? for what?
06:02:31 <shapr> Greetings Mr. Goerzen.
06:02:46 <CosmicRay> Hello Mr. Erisson
06:02:55 <CosmicRay> I feel like I've just been greeted by an agent in the matrix :-)
06:02:59 <shapr> I am a Pope!
06:03:02 <shapr> I am Pope Erisson.
06:03:13 <shapr> Everyone is a Pope actually.
06:03:20 * CosmicRay is confused
06:03:26 <shapr> Have you read the Principia Discordia?
06:03:39 <CosmicRay> no
06:03:55 <shapr> I'm also a member of the Paratheoanametamystikhood of Eris Esoteric, better known as the POEE.
06:04:17 * CosmicRay is a member of Software in the Public Interest :-)
06:04:19 <bourbaki> o.O *looks at the chan name*
06:04:45 <shapr> Why is it that people think I might stick out, even at a college?
06:04:50 <bourbaki> whats principia discordia?
06:05:54 <shapr> It's a socially significant document, written by Malaclypse the Younger.
06:06:19 <shapr> It's one of the seminal documents of the twentieth century!
06:06:33 <bourbaki> and whats it related to?
06:06:35 * shapr quickly searches for his Ritalin...
06:06:42 <CosmicRay> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia
06:07:06 <CosmicRay> ``While the Principia is unusual among religious texts for its obvious self-contradictions and strange humor, it contains several passages that suggest a serious intent behind the work, especially a message scrawled on page 00075: "If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again."''
06:07:33 <shapr> The POEE Mysteree Oath is "Fliegende Kinderscheisse!"
06:08:17 <shapr> There is in fact, a very serious intent behind the Principia Discordia.
06:08:26 <bourbaki> ... well 
06:10:18 <shapr> I'd rather a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.
06:10:43 <dons> -package deps and module deps in the same directory are super-sneaky
06:11:34 <shapr> hej yohan 
06:12:29 <shapr> bourbaki: the Principia Discordia really is worth understanding.
06:12:51 <bourbaki> sounds too religious to me
06:13:15 <shapr> Discordianism is less religious than evolution.
06:13:41 <bourbaki> and if its not wrapped in something like the 10 commandments which i can read in 2 mins its too much a hassle ;)
06:13:57 <CosmicRay> If I may drag the conversation to something related to haskell...
06:14:00 <shapr> Actually, Discordianism has only five commandments, they're known as the Pentabarf.
06:14:03 <CosmicRay> I could use some help cabalizing hsshellscript :-)
06:14:04 <shapr> CosmicRay: aw man...
06:14:07 <CosmicRay> heh
06:14:22 <shapr> what's the problem?
06:14:41 <CosmicRay> hsshellscript has one .c file, two .hsc files, and several .hs files.  It comes with a fairly run-of-the-mill Makdfile.
06:14:52 <CosmicRay> I can make it build with Cabal, but when I try to use the resulting code, I can't link an executable
06:15:01 <CosmicRay> though I can link an executable just fine with the Makefile-built version.
06:15:08 <shapr> because of the -package stuff, right?
06:15:08 <CosmicRay> I have verified that the .a file contains the same .o files
06:15:12 <CosmicRay> well, I don't know.
06:15:20 <shapr> you get the same errors you mentioned yesterday?
06:15:30 <CosmicRay> Maybe.  But I have added all that stuff to the build-depends in setup.description
06:15:30 <CosmicRay> yes.
06:15:39 <Boegel> good afternoon #haskell
06:15:41 <shapr> bourbaki: http://wikisource.org/wiki/Excerpts_from_the_Principia_Discordia#The_Five_Commandments_.28The_Pentabarf.29
06:15:43 <shapr> hoi Boegel 
06:15:43 <CosmicRay> I want to figure out how to make it work without hacking the source
06:16:01 <CosmicRay> because I should think that Cabal should work without making me hack the source
06:16:15 <shapr> hacking the source is the easiest solution, imho. That won't tell you the problem admittedly....
06:16:34 <CosmicRay> I wondering if there is a bug -- or misfeature at least -- in cabal somewhere
06:16:51 <shapr> do you have an online copy of what you have right now?
06:16:57 <CosmicRay> yeah, true, but I'd rather fix it the right way
06:16:59 <shapr> something I can grab and twiddle?
06:17:02 <CosmicRay> no but I could DCC it to you or post it.
06:17:06 <CosmicRay> what would you prefer
06:17:07 <shapr> post it... 
06:17:14 <CosmicRay> ok, one sec.
06:17:15 <shapr> ERC in xemacs doen't do DCC yet.
06:17:28 <CosmicRay> do you have Debian?
06:17:57 <shapr> unstable
06:18:17 <shapr> Remember, I'm the one always whinging on debian-haskell?
06:18:25 <CosmicRay> oh right
06:18:33 <CosmicRay> <-- bad with IRC to IRL names :-)
06:18:36 <bourbaki> shapr: ... ok i think i know why i am an atheist
06:18:39 <shapr> I'm Shae Erisson...
06:18:50 <shapr> bourbaki: so, what do you think of the Pentabarf?
06:19:11 <bourbaki> shapr: i think i can go along with the last commandment ommiting the other 4 ;)
06:19:30 <shapr> CosmicRay: I'm also the guy recently replying with a long list of libraries that you requested, and pointing you to the Wiki...
06:19:42 <CosmicRay> shapr: http://www.complete.org/~jgoerzen/t/
06:19:53 <CosmicRay> shapr: yes, I've got it :-)
06:20:01 <shapr> bourbaki: Now, apply commandment 5 to the rest of the principia, and tell me, just how religious is Discordianism?
06:20:31 <Boegel> shapr: my promotor was really enthousiastic about my work
06:20:35 <shapr> yay!
06:20:38 <Boegel> :)
06:20:42 <shapr> what did he say about literate haskell?
06:20:48 <bourbaki> shapr: why should i read it when im told to not delieve it anyway?
06:20:51 <Boegel> he gave me some hints to improve my code more
06:21:09 <Boegel> shapr: he didn't say anything about literate haskell
06:21:16 <shapr> ah, ok.
06:21:21 <Boegel> I used the old file, and I guess it the same for him
06:21:34 <Boegel> but I'll put my code in literal Haskell, looks nice :)
06:21:46 <Boegel> s/literal/literate
06:21:54 <CosmicRay> shapr: btw the upstream source is placed in both src/lib and build/ for some odd reason.  debian/rules build will make buildtmp and copy all of it there (Cabal can't seem to support multiple directories for the haskell source)
06:21:58 <shapr> bourbaki: Commandment 5 of the Pentabarf plus the rest of the Principia Discordia actually translates into "think for yourself"
06:22:13 <Boegel> shapr: he said i had to use more abstraction, and split the math and raytracing part up more
06:22:15 <bourbaki> shapr: :) ok but i do that anyway ;)
06:22:16 <Muad_Dib> shapr: btw, thanks for the link :)
06:22:21 <Muad_Dib> does the bot actually work on windows? :)
06:22:26 <shapr> heck if I know...
06:22:37 <shapr> tell me if it doesn't or send me patches.
06:23:01 <Muad_Dib> heh
06:23:42 <shapr> bourbaki: there are useful bits of wisdom in the Principia, like the Greybeard fable and some other stuff. But in general Discordianism is more than just that... I'm not sure how to describe it all, I'll think about it.
06:23:54 <shapr> Anyway, I got my last name from the Principia Discordia.
06:24:03 <bourbaki> ?
06:24:07 <bourbaki> your lastname?
06:24:22 <shapr> I'm Shae Erisson.
06:24:31 <shapr> hi arsouille 
06:24:37 <desrt> eris :)
06:24:43 <shapr> y0 desrt 
06:24:51 <shapr> arsouille: salut, fran√ßais?
06:25:07 <arsouille> yep
06:25:31 <shapr> learning Haskell? long-time user?
06:25:59 <shapr> CosmicRay: btw, there are several other unixy shellscripty Haskell libs online.
06:26:21 <Boegel> does anyone has experience with Tcl-Haskell bindings ?
06:26:32 <shapr> Boegel: UniForM has them.
06:26:43 <CosmicRay> shapr: I found two or three -- can't remember the names right now -- but in general they didn't really have enough features to warrant me packaging them
06:26:51 <arsouille> lol i lose my way i don't use i juste what to how what language is :)
06:27:20 <shapr> Haskell is a purely functional programming language.
06:27:21 <Boegel> arsouille: it's a functional language
06:27:25 <desrt> xerox; salut, fran√ßais?
06:27:41 <Boegel> shapr: what is UniForM ?
06:27:44 <arsouille> je suis francais :)
06:27:55 <shapr> desrt: parlez vous fran√ßais aussi? Est-ce que quebecois fran√ßais? :-)
06:28:06 <arsouille> francais de france ;)
06:28:09 <desrt> shapr: non.  je suis ontarian
06:28:25 <shapr> heh, fair enough
06:28:27 <desrt> quebec est le suck
06:28:31 <desrt> =)
06:28:35 * shapr laughs
06:28:50 <shapr> arsouille: have you used scheme, lisp, or OCaml?
06:29:22 <shapr> CosmicRay: what's the automated way to apply this diff to the orig?
06:29:31 <xerox> Deniz no, italian
06:29:36 <CosmicRay> shapr: dpkg-source -x *.dsc
06:29:39 <xerox> wops, i mean desrt
06:29:57 <shapr> arsouille: here's the super short demo - http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
06:30:17 * desrt shares the Œª
06:30:46 <desrt> arsouille; haskell is quite unlike languages like c, java, ...
06:31:33 <desrt> people around here are a little bit crazy.  they call java "low-level" out of spite for it :)
06:31:45 <arsouille> :) thx 
06:31:49 <Philippa> I wouldn't call it low-level, just castrated
06:32:06 <Philippa> but yeah, it's lower-level than Haskell is for a whole pile of reasons
06:32:12 <CosmicRay> desrt: they just think it's low-level because it requires almost as much keyboarding as assembly :-)
06:32:28 <desrt> oh! perfect!
06:32:31 <shapr> Java is the COBOL of tomorrow.
06:32:34 * desrt gets an idea
06:32:47 <CosmicRay> have you ever tried to read from the keyboard in java?
06:32:49 <desrt> myself and this guy i go to school with are supposed to write a haskell project < 500 lines
06:32:50 <Philippa> CosmicRay: not true, most assemblers support macros
06:32:53 <desrt> we ought to do a C compiler
06:32:55 <shapr> Actually, Java is the other COBOL of today.
06:32:59 <CosmicRay> reading one line takes about 3 full lines of code 
06:33:03 <CosmicRay> Philippa: ahhaha
06:33:09 <Philippa> shapr: "other"? It's the language with the most written lines of code now
06:33:40 <desrt> do you think it would be possible to impliment a reasonable subset of C in 500lines of haskell?
06:33:41 <arsouille> it s remind me like caml :)
06:33:59 <desrt> (assuming parsec is available, etc)
06:34:06 <Philippa> desrt: as an interpreter, certainly
06:34:21 <Philippa> a compiler's more of a PITA
06:34:29 * desrt can do codegen
06:34:32 <bourbaki> gyros pita :)
06:34:46 <CosmicRay> if template haskell is anything like camlp4, you could write a C-to-Haskell converter fairly trivially
06:34:53 <CosmicRay> then the code could be compiled via ghc
06:34:59 <desrt> cosmic; that's cheating :)
06:34:59 <CosmicRay> and poof -- a C compiler via Haskell.
06:35:00 <CosmicRay> :-)
06:35:04 <CosmicRay> hehe
06:35:14 <desrt> a haskell program that takes c source and gives you assembly
06:35:16 <Philippa> CosmicRay: you could do it by embedding the C code as a string
06:35:21 <CosmicRay> heh
06:35:22 <desrt> i mean.. it's practically a non-op, right? :)
06:35:36 <Philippa> but yeah, I've been looking at ways of doing compiler stuff cheaply
06:35:54 <Philippa> desrt: a monadic interpreter is far easier to write if you grok monad transformers
06:36:07 <desrt> dwah <- ?
06:36:15 <desrt> no.  i believe not.
06:37:08 <desrt> ok.  here's the deal.  you can convert C to assembly practically line-for-line
06:37:24 <desrt> i don't plan on using registers intelligently or anything
06:37:35 <desrt> ie: all variables stored in memory
06:38:16 <Igloo> You still need to lex it, parse it, do variable scoping etc. I'd be impressed if you could do the whole language in 500 lines of nice code
06:38:40 <desrt> Igloo; just a subset
06:39:13 <desrt> so your basic hello world program with loops and ifs and so on works
06:39:42 <desrt> if we do things like the 1284 different ways of initialising a struct then it won't work...
06:41:55 <Cale> A simple imperative language would certainly be possible I think.
06:42:40 <Cale> The hardest part is keeping the grammar simple so that the parser doesn't chew up too many lines :)
06:43:05 <Oejet> Cale, maybe the while language?
06:44:18 <desrt> cale; btw - the 'other guy' is scott
06:44:23 <Cale> cool
06:44:42 <desrt> i got the whole project planned out
06:44:48 <desrt> (1) tell scott
06:44:53 <desrt> (2) leave him alone for 2 weeks
06:44:56 <desrt> (3) admire the result
06:45:03 * Oejet wonders who Scott is.
06:45:34 <desrt> someone who is better at haskell than dr. kahl, wolfgang and cale all put together
06:45:46 <shapr> wolfgang kahl?
06:45:52 <desrt> wolfram kahl
06:45:56 <shapr> oh right
06:46:02 <shapr> I've hacked on some of his code, good stuff.
06:46:07 <desrt> wolfgang thaller
06:46:11 <desrt> you've hacked on some of his stuff too :)
06:46:13 <shapr> you got thaller??
06:46:16 <Cale> Scott was just learning when I came to mac
06:46:20 <desrt> ya.  he's elite :)
06:46:31 <desrt> Cale; ok.  i exagerated a little >:)
06:46:33 <shapr> yes, I sat next to Thaller at HIM2003
06:46:42 <desrt> i sit next to him on a daily basis
06:46:42 <shapr> who is this Scott person?
06:46:58 <Cale> Scott was a student working for Dr. Kahl
06:47:06 <shapr> website? code?
06:47:15 <desrt> ok.  so i talked him up just a little
06:47:19 <desrt> he's more or less a beginner :)
06:47:24 <shapr> ah, ok.
06:47:25 <Cale> heheh
06:47:41 <Cale> but he's written some practical Haskell code
06:47:50 <Boegel> shapr was getting nervous :p
06:47:56 <desrt> hahah
06:48:02 <shapr> Was getting hopeful for more code..
06:48:06 <shapr> I need my fix man!
06:48:21 <desrt> shapr; we'll let you use our C compiler when it's done
06:48:31 <desrt> you seem like the kind of guy who likes C compilers...
06:48:38 <shapr> Though dons recent accomplishments should keep me on a nice high for a week or two.
06:48:43 * Boegel tries to calm shapr down... you'll get your fix boy, ssst
06:49:05 <desrt> it's so weird how small the haskell world is
06:49:09 <shapr> Especially if I get to dump emacs and use dons code instead.
06:49:17 <desrt> shae knows dr. kahl *and* wolfgang...
06:49:25 <shapr> Shae knows everybody. :-P
06:49:27 * shapr laughs
06:49:34 <desrt> fine.  who is ryan?
06:49:41 <Cale> ahaha
06:49:41 <yohan> im splitting my program into modules and i have a bunch of types i want ever module to know, how would i easiest accomplish this without writing the type definition in every module?
06:49:43 <shapr> Who, David Ryan at Drexel?
06:49:49 <desrt> no.  ryan lortie at mcmaster
06:49:59 <shapr> oh, no idea :-(
06:50:03 <desrt> bastard >:|
06:50:04 <shapr> Is he a Haskeller?
06:50:07 <desrt> ya
06:50:11 * shapr laughs evilly
06:50:19 <Cale> hint: It's someone here.
06:50:23 <shapr> desrt: I've never heard of him.
06:50:27 <desrt> hahahah
06:50:46 * shapr is being vicious on purpose.
06:50:48 <Boegel> yohan: putting those types in a seperate modules, and loading that module in every other module ?
06:50:54 <desrt> shapr; i had sort of imagined :)
06:51:07 <desrt> arf.  i gotta get ready to go
06:51:16 <yohan> Boegel ive tried that but it doesnt seem to work :), do i load after the module *** where or before`
06:51:51 <Boegel> yohan: eh, I don't know 
06:52:01 <Boegel> yohan: that's the first thing that crossed my mind...
06:52:09 <yohan> yes..
06:52:40 <yohan> i get syntax error in declaration (unexpected keyword "where") if i add it after where
06:52:47 <shapr> desrt: anyway, Wolfgang Thaller might know me, but I seriously doubt wolfram kahl will have any idea who I am.
06:53:13 <desrt> well, you should talk to them
06:53:16 <desrt> they both know ryan lortie :P
06:53:21 * shapr laughs
06:53:39 <desrt> btw: got some parsec example code?
06:53:49 <desrt> actually... i might just look at slate
06:53:51 <shapr> ok, I'll give in and admit, I do know who Ryan Lortie is, though I haven't seen any of his code.
06:53:53 <desrt> cale; is it easy enough to understand?
06:54:01 * shapr looks at desrt significantly
06:54:10 <Boegel> yohan: I think you need the load the module on the _first_ line of every other module...
06:54:26 <Cale> desrt: possibly -- it's probably easier to just look at the parsec documentation, which has lots of examples in it
06:54:30 <Boegel> "import typeModule" should be your first line
06:54:36 <desrt> cale; ah excellent
06:54:38 <shapr> what's slate?
06:54:44 <desrt> shapr; i have some very small pieces of code in ghc
06:54:49 <shapr> whoa, cool
06:54:51 <desrt> shapr; they're not haskell, though :)
06:54:55 <shapr> fair enough
06:55:04 <Cale> slate is the declarative assembly language I was working on
06:55:08 <shapr> I've been meaning to get around to making CosmicRay happy with IPv6 support.
06:55:10 <Lemmih> Boegel: Module names must be capitalized.
06:55:26 <Boegel> Lemmih: oh ?
06:55:32 <shapr> ghc IPv6 support would be pretty simple, it's just the getting started that's hard for me.
06:55:35 <Boegel> I guess I'm confusing then...
06:55:40 <Lemmih> yohan: Perhaps you could post the code on the Haskell wiki.
06:55:41 <desrt> Cale; we have copies of our paper circulating at school as issue 20(?) of the SQRL report
06:55:53 <shapr> Cale: is it online?
06:55:59 * shapr asks google
06:56:15 <yohan> nvm i solved it :)...misspelled 'module' in one of my modules...err
06:56:26 <Boegel> Lemmih: oh wait, you mean it should be "import TypeModule" ?
06:56:28 <bourbaki> bye bye gonna go to bed now
06:56:56 <Lemmih> Boegel: Indeed.
06:56:58 <desrt> ok.  gotta go.  ciao
06:57:09 <shapr> Cale: was hoping it wouldn't be the same Slate that water runs.
06:57:25 * shapr dislikes water.
06:57:39 <Cale> yeah
06:57:44 <Cale> It's not :)
06:58:04 <Cale> to both concerns :)
06:58:41 * CosmicRay returns
06:59:28 <Cale> It's not really polished -- there's some good code there, but it's really a component, and so for now it's primarily useful as a tool which you control with ghci. It might appear online once coconut decides to make code public. :)
06:59:48 <shapr> ok
06:59:49 <Cale> We used it to get our ridiculously fast sine/cosine code.
07:00:17 <shapr> You guys are doing parallel/distributed Haskell stuff, right?
07:00:49 <shapr> Are you using GHC 6.2 for it? GdH and GpH look neat, but are waay behind GHC proper. Is there something better?
07:01:10 <Cale> we probably will be, to make our compiler work across machines, because the methods it will use are much more time consuming than the average compiler
07:01:35 <shapr> Have you guys already checked out Goffin/GdH/GpH/Parr ?
07:01:35 <Cale> Wolfgang is threatening to update GpH to work with the latest GHC on mac, at least.
07:01:43 <shapr> ah, excellent
07:02:06 <shapr> I just swapped some emails with Phil Trinder, I should be getting the latest unreleased GpH soon.
07:02:14 <shapr> or GdH, I forget which
07:02:44 <shapr> I want to write a language interpreter in Haskell, that can really use SMP or distributed resources.
07:03:05 <shapr> not just with threads.
07:04:01 <Cale> Write such an interpreter which takes native assembly and runs it on the same architecture, but uses the network :)
07:04:38 <Cale> (or even just SMP)
07:05:24 <shapr> There isn't Erlang-OTP-style support in GHC
07:05:38 <shapr> well, I just found two projects that I haven't investigated, but otherwise...
07:06:45 <Cale> anyway, better run
07:06:49 <shapr> right, ttyl
07:33:13 <shapr> Has anyone tried the OOHaskell stuff yet?
07:40:15 <Boegel> shapr: is that object-oriented Haskell, as in while using type classes?
07:40:26 <shapr> http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/OOHaskell/
07:42:01 <Boegel> hmmz, I think I'll need some stuff like that
07:44:19 <Boegel> I'm off for a while
07:44:20 <Boegel> bye !
07:45:03 <CosmicRay> shapr: it sounds interesting but since it's only there for hugs, I'm probably not going to use it
07:46:27 <monochrom> I think you've confused O'Haskell with OOHaskell.
07:46:30 <arjanb> oleg coauthors to much papers i can't even keep up reading them
07:46:44 <shapr> I want to hang out with Oleg...
07:47:06 <shapr> If I can keep my brain from exploding, I'll get a huge jump in my understanding of all this stuff.
07:48:40 <CosmicRay> oh.
08:15:08 <shapr> hiya gintas 
08:21:04 * shapr boings furiously
08:26:44 <Lemmih> Hello Boegel.
08:27:06 <Boegel> hello Lemmih :)
08:27:15 <Boegel> I'm not really getting the whole ShowS thing :s
08:27:24 <Lemmih> @index ShowS
08:27:24 <lambdabot> GHC.Show,Prelude,Text.Show
08:27:29 <Boegel> what's the idea behind it ? why is it faster ?
08:27:47 <Boegel> @index Prelude.ShowS
08:27:47 <Lemmih> Isn't ShowS just a type?
08:27:48 <lambdabot> bzzt
08:27:59 <Lemmih> String -> String
08:28:02 <shapr> how many ops --> ("1" ++ "2") ++ ("3" ++ "4") ++ ("5" ++ "6")
08:28:03 <Boegel> yeah, but you can use it with shows
08:28:14 <Boegel> shapr: 5 ?
08:28:19 <shapr> how many times is a new string created with that code?
08:28:41 <shapr> I think it's actually four.
08:28:45 <Boegel> 5 times ?
08:28:50 <Boegel> "12" = 1
08:28:54 <Boegel> "34" = 2
08:29:00 <Boegel> "1234" = 3
08:29:04 <Boegel> "56" = 4
08:29:10 <Boegel> "123456" = 5
08:29:12 <Boegel> right ?
08:29:13 <shapr> nah, I'm using ++ to concatenate together strings.
08:29:23 <Boegel> so am I :p
08:29:28 <shapr> oh right
08:29:29 <shapr> doh
08:29:36 * shapr tries to wake up
08:29:51 * Boegel doesn't get it at all now :p
08:29:52 <shapr> well, look at the implementation of ++
08:30:28 <shapr> I'm pretty sure the strings created are "12","34","56", and "123456"
08:30:44 <Boegel> ow yeah
08:30:50 <Boegel> you could be right :)
08:31:25 <shapr> Thing is, ++ is lazy. Did you check the implementation?
08:32:20 <shapr> Boegel: prewritten - http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/Learning-Haskell-Notes.html#UsingShowS
08:32:22 <Boegel> no, because I can't find it :p
08:32:59 <Boegel> let's read that one too shapr, because the text from the Haskell.org tutorial didn't make it clear enough
08:33:01 <shapr> in short, a bunch of ++ calls in a row end up only creating one new string at the end
08:33:13 <shapr> because Haskell is not a strict language.
08:33:40 <shapr> in Python, "foo" + "bar" + "baz" means "foobar" is created, and then "foobarbaz"
08:33:57 <Boegel> uhu
08:34:44 <tuomov> if you look at it that way, are you sure "12" etc. are "created" in any way either?
08:35:10 <shapr> possibly not, but I was trying to force evaluation with the parens.
08:35:34 <shapr> The more I use laziness, the more I like it.
08:35:37 <CosmicRay> shapr: any feedback on my cabal problem?
08:35:43 <shapr> er, sorry.. got distracted.
08:35:48 <CosmicRay> no problem
08:35:57 * shapr looks
08:36:54 <shapr> Boegel: oh, did you find UniForM?
08:37:25 <shapr> CosmicRay: where's haskell-devscripts?
08:37:26 <shapr> greetz mornfall 
08:37:40 <shapr> is it haskell-unsafe?
08:38:39 <mornfall> yow shapr 
08:38:59 <mornfall> shapr: no haskell questions, entangled with prolog atm ;p
08:39:05 <CosmicRay> shapr: it is waiting for ftpmaster at the moment
08:39:07 <CosmicRay> let me post it
08:39:19 <mornfall> and the course is going slooowly
08:39:54 <CosmicRay> shapr: it's now available from http://www.complete.org/~jgoerzen/t as well
08:40:09 <CosmicRay> shapr: it contains dh_haskell
08:40:18 <CosmicRay> shapr: my uber-cabal-to-deb tool :-)
08:42:46 <CosmicRay> ah prolog
08:42:50 <CosmicRay> an interesting language indeed
08:42:56 <CosmicRay> actually fairly similar to haskell in some ways
08:43:00 <CosmicRay> a lot less useful :-)
08:43:01 <Boegel> I know some prolog...
08:43:08 <Boegel> had to do a project in it for school...
08:43:12 <Boegel> strange language sometimes
08:43:47 <Boegel> shapr: I don't think UniForM is what I'm looking for
08:44:04 <shapr> it has a Tk interface
08:44:15 <Boegel> I was wondering if it would be hard to add some functionality to FranTk (that is build upon Tcl/Tk)
08:44:37 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Did you compile the printf library?
08:44:42 <Boegel> that's why I asked about Tcl bindings (maybe I misformulated myself)
08:44:53 <CosmicRay> Igloo: no, I thought you were going to
08:44:58 <CosmicRay> Igloo: however I could
08:45:03 <CosmicRay> Igloo: I definately want it
08:45:04 <Igloo> Compile, not package
08:45:15 <CosmicRay> oh, it's not useful to me unless it's packaged
08:45:35 <Igloo> We're at cross-purposes - I'm just asking whether it compiled for you  :-)
08:45:54 <CosmicRay> haven't tried
08:46:08 <Igloo> Ah, OK, I just got the impression you had
08:46:10 <CosmicRay> I could if that would be a useful datapoint on the path to getting it in sid :-)
08:46:29 <Igloo> No, I was just confused about how you had managed to do so  :-)
08:46:32 <Boegel> what am I doing wrong with this shows function ?
08:46:33 <Boegel> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview
08:48:29 <Boegel> GHC tell me that 'stringify' is applied to too much arguments :s
08:48:46 <Boegel> but if I remove xs , how will it continue then ?
08:50:58 <Igloo> You probably want the last . to be a $
08:51:17 <tromp> @index $()
08:51:18 <lambdabot> bzzt
08:51:28 <Igloo> As it's a value, not a function you want to compose with
08:51:40 <Igloo> Or replace (xs) with $ xs
08:51:57 <Igloo> tromp: -fth if you want Template Haskell splices
08:53:44 <tromp> @index $() -fth
08:53:44 <lambdabot> bzzt
08:54:10 <Igloo> It's syntax, not a function
08:54:21 <tromp> aha
08:54:33 <tromp> thought it was like Expr -> String
08:55:11 <Boegel> Igloo: I still doesn't work if I replace the last . with $
08:57:04 <Boegel> Couldn't match `[Char]' against `Char'
08:57:04 <Boegel>     Expected type: [Char]
08:57:04 <Boegel>     Inferred type: Char
08:57:04 <Boegel> In the application `stringify xs'
08:57:04 <Boegel> In the second argument of `($)', namely `stringify xs'
08:57:43 <Boegel> In the second argument of `($)', namely `stringify xs'
08:57:46 <Boegel> woops
08:59:31 <musasabi> shows height . ("\n255\n":) $ stringify xs
09:02:30 <Boegel> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview
09:02:44 <Boegel> adjusted, still this error ->
09:02:47 <Boegel> Couldn't match `[Char]' against `Char'
09:07:51 <Boegel> anyone who can help me with this... 'cause I'm still not getting it :s
09:13:13 <TheHunter> Boegel: ("foo":) -> ("foo"++)
09:13:54 <Boegel> TheHunter: I get that
09:14:12 <Boegel> but how can I concatenate the 'stringify xs' part to the rest ?
09:14:43 <Boegel> but how can I concatenate the 'stringify xs' part to the rest ?
09:14:47 <Boegel> woops again :s
09:14:48 <Boegel> damned
09:16:05 <TheHunter> Boegel: problem solved?
09:17:00 <shapr> CosmicRay: running debuild works fine for me... is that how you do it?
09:17:18 <Boegel> TheHunter: no
09:18:32 <Boegel> TheHunter: I get the function compisition thing, and the interpretation of ("foo":), but I don't know how I can merge the recursive call of stringify to the rest...
09:18:54 <Boegel> (brb)
09:18:58 <CosmicRay> shapr: yes
09:19:03 <CosmicRay> shapr: the resulting library doesn't work
09:19:09 <CosmicRay> shapr: install the .deb and try compiling one of the sts
09:19:28 <CosmicRay> ffor instance, cd src/test; ghc --make -o cwd -package hsshellscript cwd.hs
09:20:29 <CosmicRay> s/sts/tests/
09:20:32 <TheHunter> Boegel: stringify [] = ""
09:20:32 <CosmicRay> wow bad typing day.
09:21:22 * shapr really has to get around to zsh ghc autocompletion
09:21:48 <CosmicRay> pfft.  write a new shell in haskell :-)
09:21:58 <CosmicRay> actually, that's been done...
09:22:04 * stepcut uses eshell
09:22:12 <shapr> yah, but it was just a lark, if you mean Hsh.hs
09:22:20 <CosmicRay> yeah, I think that's what I mean
09:22:21 <shapr> speaking of eshell...
09:22:22 <CosmicRay> and I know
09:22:53 * shapr waves the post-emacs flag
09:23:43 <musasabi> Boegel: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage uses show for the pixel data.
09:23:59 <shapr> Hemacs is just starting up... time to jump in if you want to understand the code lateron.
09:25:34 * CosmicRay goes to lunch
09:26:17 * musasabi goes to sauna
09:26:24 * shapr goes to crazy
09:26:56 <shapr> I swear, this is a linker setting problem, but I don't see it.
09:31:55 <stepcut> shapr: is there an hemacs site/mailing list yet ?
09:32:31 <shapr> post-emacs has been coopted - http://lists.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/post-emacs
09:33:14 <shapr> <dons> hemacs is born : darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hemacs
09:33:21 <shapr> requires the nightly version of hs-plugins
09:34:02 <stepcut> http://lists.scannedinavian.org/pipermail/post-emacs/
09:34:02 <Igloo> I thought he since made a snapshot - or was that for something else?
09:34:08 <stepcut> :(
09:34:18 <shapr> yah, the list isn't a month old yet...
09:34:21 <stepcut> heh
09:34:33 <shapr> ok, I give in, I'll make mailman create an archive.
09:35:38 <stepcut> has hs-plugins been cabalized ?
09:37:51 <shapr> don't think so
09:39:11 <stepcut> so in what ways do you think post-emacs will be better than emacs ?
09:39:34 <shapr> first off, multithreading
09:39:40 <stepcut> agreed
09:39:41 <shapr> second, no elisp
09:40:12 <shapr> I like Haskell, I'd like to try writing an editor in Haskell.
09:40:23 <kristnjov> edito for what?
09:40:30 <shapr> I've been thinking about an concurrent Joy as a scripting language
09:41:01 <shapr> anyway, it's not my project
09:41:24 <shapr> I'd rather argue with people on the mailing list to find what is good about emacs and leave out the sucky bits
09:42:07 <shapr> stepcut: I want an editor designed around a good incremental parser, and I want to use that for syntax highlighting, parse tree macros, maybe even refactoring.
09:42:12 <stepcut> the things I dislike about emacs include, (1) no real multithreading (2) 'modules' don't contain their own namespace, and can not be cleanly unloaded or reloaded
09:42:39 <shapr> using regexes for everything also sucks
09:42:45 <stepcut> (3) the syntax highlighting stuff is horrid to write
09:43:11 <shapr> semantic bovinator is the right idea, but it's flaky, and very few modes use it.
09:43:33 <stepcut> shapr: i have not looked into that  (sb)
09:43:51 <shapr> Anyway, tuomov uses jed/joe, dons uses vim, and I use emacs, that should hopefully make for a more balanced viewpoint on the mailing list.
09:44:02 <stepcut> heh
09:44:57 <stepcut> Someone here at work uses some closed source windows shareware text editor under wine for writing kde apps :)
09:45:03 <shapr> !
09:47:11 <Lemmih> Could it break cabal to have more information in the description file?
09:47:29 <Boegel> TheHunter: the "" trick doesn't help either... :(
09:47:38 <Boegel> that's the same actually....
09:47:39 <Lemmih> s/Could/Would/
09:47:47 <Boegel> " " = [' '], "" = []
09:47:52 <Boegel> so both lists...
09:49:28 <TheHunter> Boegel: sure it does
09:50:20 <TheHunter> in your original solution, you have to replace : with ++ twice and ' ' with " " once, then it compiles
09:50:43 <TheHunter> "" = [] :: String which is different from [] :: [a]
09:51:01 <TheHunter> you can also use one of the two versions above yours on the wiki
09:51:46 <TheHunter> oh, they're both different
09:51:53 <Boegel> yes they are :)
09:52:13 <Boegel> but I can replace the [(a,a,a)] and [(Int,Int,Int)] with my Color type
09:53:02 <Boegel> the whole idea was getting rid of ++, or isn't that possible ?
09:54:02 <TheHunter> Boegel: look at the solution on top of the page
09:54:07 <TheHunter> i just fixed it
09:55:27 <TheHunter> well, if you want to get rid of it completely, you might replace ("foo"++) with ('f':) . ('o':) . ('o':)
09:55:37 <TheHunter> but that doesn't make any sense
09:55:42 <Boegel> ("\n255\n"++) --> this ++ is neccesary ?
09:55:55 <Boegel> yeah, that's true, that's just plain stupid :)
09:56:15 <Boegel> thanks a lot TheHunter ! but can you tell me what I did wrong ? i want to learn :)
09:56:54 <TheHunter> Boegel: this ++ is kinda  necessary.
09:57:43 <TheHunter> first of all stringify should have been of type [Color] -> String
09:58:04 <TheHunter> so stringify [] = ' ' doesn't typecheck, because ' ' is not a string
09:58:12 <TheHunter> the next thing is:
09:58:24 <TheHunter> @type ("foo":)
09:58:26 <lambdabot> ("foo":) :: [[Char]] -> [[Char]]
09:58:50 <Boegel> @type ('f':)
09:58:51 <lambdabot> ('f':) :: [Char] -> [Char]
09:58:56 <TheHunter> so ("foo":) doesn't map Strings to Strings but lists of Strings to lists of Strings which is not what you want.
09:58:59 <Boegel> this was a mistake to ?
09:59:09 <TheHunter> yep
09:59:16 <Boegel> ow okay
09:59:18 <Boegel> i see
09:59:21 <Boegel> thank you !
09:59:36 <TheHunter> you're welcome
09:59:58 <Boegel> I have to go now, please my girlfriend :p
10:00:00 <Boegel> bye !
10:00:04 <shapr> :-)
10:00:14 <TheHunter> bye
10:01:50 <kristnjov> i have this function.... columnize (x:xs) (y:ys) = x ++ y ++ "\n" ++ columnize xs ys
10:01:59 <kristnjov> is there a standard function which does this for me?
10:02:06 <kristnjov> the lists are lists of strings
10:02:10 <kristnjov> if that makes any difference
10:02:50 <shapr>  I think there's one like that in ginsu's GenUtil.hs
10:03:09 <kristnjov> oh, but no such function in the prelude?
10:03:15 <shapr> don't think so.
10:03:26 <shapr> I think the one in GenUtil does any number of cols
10:03:32 <kristnjov> cool
10:03:38 <Lemmih> What about zip + foldl?
10:03:52 <shapr> and there's some paragraph and other formatting options in GenUtil
10:04:16 <TheHunter> Lemmih: foldr
10:04:25 <ski> columnize xs ys = unlines (zipWith (++) xs ys)   ?
10:04:40 <kristnjov> ski, that would do the same thing?
10:04:56 <Lemmih> TheHunter: Whatever.
10:05:13 <TheHunter> Lemmih: ski's solution is the best one anyway
10:05:14 <kristnjov> ski, thanks man
10:05:59 <ski> kristnjov : it might well be that your orig. columnize is a little bit more efficient than mine ..
10:06:19 <ski> (because of "left-associative" use of (++))
10:06:31 <kristnjov> cool
10:06:44 <kristnjov> but our tutor says it's always good to use higher-order functions so i'll stick to that, thanks man
10:08:01 <ski> mhmm
10:10:21 <Lemmih> Would it break cabal to have more information in the description file?
10:10:29 * shapr doesn't know
10:10:30 <shapr> you can try it.
10:13:04 <Lemmih> Darn. It breaks /-:
10:13:19 <shapr> you could fix it =)
10:17:23 <Igloo> I think I should get some sort of award for the percentage of =s on this line:    | op == '(==) = x == y
10:17:34 <bbls> :)
10:20:21 <kristnjov> congrats, you get the award for least stuff to do in his spare time
10:20:22 <kristnjov> :O
10:20:44 <shapr> I think Igloo gets money to write Haskell, so...
10:21:02 <Igloo> I wasn't /trying/ to do it!
10:22:00 <Lemmih> shapr: It's pretty dirty... I got it to ignore all unknown fields.
10:22:19 <Igloo> It should at least warn about them
10:23:44 <Lemmih> Igloo: Yeah but that would require some refactoring.
10:26:30 <ski> Igloo : "'(==)" ?
10:26:50 <Igloo> TH for "the name of the (==) function"
10:26:50 * shapr was wondering thattoo
10:26:53 <shapr> ohh
10:26:56 <shapr> neat
10:27:27 * ski thought the rest of the line looked like SML ..
10:31:07 * ski almost tried to write "/join ..." in a shell to ssh somewhere ..
10:31:25 <bbls> hi ski :)
10:31:36 <ski> hello bbls
10:31:36 <shapr> ski: haha
10:31:47 <shapr> I keep typing @type in ghci
10:31:58 <shapr> and occasionally :index
10:33:40 * CosmicRay returns
10:33:43 <bourbaki> moin
10:33:57 <CosmicRay> hi
10:34:04 * shapr traces CosmicRay 
10:34:17 <CosmicRay> ah, you are ipv6 as well
10:34:23 <bourbaki> who was it again that wrote a ray tracer in hs?
10:34:24 * shapr multicasts CosmicRay 
10:34:32 <shapr> Boegel wrote one.
10:34:35 <CosmicRay> heh
10:34:44 <shapr> and Andreas Birkman, and Wolfgang Thaller, and ...
10:34:45 <bourbaki> with gfx output?
10:34:54 <CosmicRay> shapr: I am configured using the global 6to4 gateway
10:35:03 <CosmicRay> which is really an anycast address, IIRC
10:35:03 <shapr> lucky you.
10:35:12 <shapr> er wait
10:35:14 <shapr> global?
10:35:23 <CosmicRay> well, yes and no.  I think the closest 6to4 router is in France, and I'm in the USA :-)
10:35:24 <CosmicRay> yeah
10:35:38 <CosmicRay> no account needed
10:35:45 <shapr> I know what 6to4 is...
10:35:52 <CosmicRay> you map your ipv4 address into ipv6...
10:35:52 <CosmicRay> oh
10:36:00 <shapr> but I thought the intervening routers had to support IPv6?
10:36:06 <CosmicRay> no
10:36:10 <shapr> huh
10:36:11 <CosmicRay> it leaves our network in ipv4
10:36:17 <CosmicRay> lesse.  192.88.99.1 is it.
10:36:23 <shapr> I've been using freenet6
10:36:43 <shapr> ok... how do I do this?
10:37:00 <shapr> also, can we collaborate on IPv6 support in GHC? :-)
10:37:04 <shapr> I surely want it.
10:37:16 <CosmicRay> yes it is just a matter of me finding some time
10:37:26 <CosmicRay> hang on, getting you a url
10:37:28 * shapr starts his paper "On the use of Multicast for Distributed Object Frameworks"
10:37:30 <CosmicRay> I wrote a mini howto about it
10:37:48 <CosmicRay> http://master-www.complete.org/~jgoerzen/changelog_old/http/node/view/61.html
10:38:11 <CosmicRay> you can do it solely with the standard network tools in Debian
10:38:23 * shapr cackles happily
10:38:47 <jesse99> tuple...cough..spaces
10:39:01 <CosmicRay> btw it should be fairly simple to add ipv6 to haskell
10:39:14 <CosmicRay> there are some new calls into libc for dns stuff
10:39:21 <shapr> musasabi had some interesting thoughts on linda spaces recently.
10:39:22 <CosmicRay> and of course a new sockaddr structure
10:39:32 <shapr> right, I've read up on porting apps to IPv6
10:39:37 <shapr> it's straightforward
10:40:00 <CosmicRay> the differences really end before the socket is even connected
10:40:11 <CosmicRay> (unless you're doign a server, I suppose, but still -- not many differences there)
10:40:53 <shapr> I'd love to some multicast stuff with Haskell.
10:44:39 * shapr wishes for wireless everything
10:45:06 <CosmicRay> <homer> mmmm..... wireless pizza.... </homer>
10:45:17 <shapr> :-)
10:45:31 <shapr> I type too much.
10:45:42 <CosmicRay> any cabal ideas? :-)
10:45:51 <shapr> it must be a linking problem
10:45:57 <shapr> but I can't figure out what's going on.
10:45:57 <ski> (shapr : where ? (re linda))
10:46:01 * maihem jiggles
10:46:10 <CosmicRay> at least it's not just me
10:46:15 <shapr> I'm convinced it's in the Package description somewhere.
10:46:30 <shapr> have you compared package.conf, cabal versus make?
10:46:36 <CosmicRay> did you notice that the original Makefile used an undocumented ghc switch?
10:46:38 <CosmicRay> -syslibs or something
10:46:56 <CosmicRay> the make one is in lib/hsshellscript.pkg
10:47:00 <shapr> no, I didn't notice that.
10:47:11 <CosmicRay> -syslib.
10:47:21 <CosmicRay> LIBS            = build/libhsshellscript.a -syslib lang -syslib posix -syslib te
10:47:21 <CosmicRay> xt -syslib util
10:47:39 <shapr> strange
10:47:40 <CosmicRay> I couldn't find a reference to -syslib anywhere
10:47:48 <shapr> I've heard of it, not sure where.
10:47:52 <CosmicRay> google showed me a few other people that had used it, but nothing that said what it does.
10:48:00 <CosmicRay> nothing about it in the ghc docs, manpage, or --help
10:48:03 <Igloo> Is it a new portable -package or something?
10:48:12 <Igloo> Hmm, or was it the old name for -package?
10:48:15 <CosmicRay> actually my guess is that it's some sort of deprecated thing
10:48:17 <shapr> might be the old name
10:48:29 <CosmicRay> I think igloo is closer
10:48:33 <CosmicRay> but here's the other odd thing
10:48:34 <shapr> CosmicRay: I think hsshellscript just need to be source hacked so it's no longer braindead.
10:48:43 <CosmicRay> there is a posix package out there in ghc
10:48:46 <shapr> is it no longer maintained?
10:48:46 <CosmicRay> but I have no idea why
10:48:52 <CosmicRay> the docs don't say
10:48:53 <shapr> isn't posix way old?
10:48:57 <CosmicRay> no, it is maintained
10:49:19 <CosmicRay> last release sept. 21
10:49:21 <Igloo> Oh, this isn't in cabal but a cabalised package? That makes more sense then
10:49:23 <shapr> huh
10:49:38 <CosmicRay> Igloo: right, I'm trying to cabalize hsshellscript
10:50:05 <Igloo> The posix in hslibs is presumably deprecated
10:54:00 <kristnjov> how do i get everything but the last element from a list?
10:54:09 <Lemmih> shapr: I don't really like the idea of getting information from the cabal description file.
10:54:36 <kristnjov> never mind
10:54:52 <shapr> Lemmih: what do you think is better?
10:56:00 <shapr> hei mflux 
10:56:16 <Lemmih> shapr: Having all of the information in the wiki.
10:57:33 <CosmicRay> Lemmih: what information do you mean?
10:57:49 <CosmicRay> As far as I'm concerned, the cabal description file is the perfect vehicle for the grand unification of everything :-)
10:58:25 <mflux> well hello
10:58:27 <Lemmih> CosmicRay: Basic description, where it has been tested and where it can be downloaded.
10:58:45 <CosmicRay> that sounds like good stuff for Setup.description
10:58:54 <CosmicRay> is this for a new libraries website?
10:58:58 <Lemmih> Yes.
10:58:59 <shapr> mflux: haluatko tehda Haskell-la? (oh I give up)
10:59:43 <shapr> mflux: learning Haskell? long-time user?
10:59:53 <mflux> shapr, (haluatko tehd‰ haskellilla/haluatko ohjelmoida haskellilla) well Haskell is a language I've been intending to learn some day
11:00:10 <shapr> today is the day!
11:00:14 <mflux> so, nope, no experience whatsoever
11:00:32 <shapr> ok, any experience with functional programming before?
11:00:44 <mflux> but I did recently learn most important parts of ocaml, and before that lisp
11:00:57 <shapr> ah, excellent.
11:01:11 <CosmicRay> mflux: this is a good place to start: http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/htut/
11:01:21 <CosmicRay> don't believe anything that says "Gentle" in its title :-)
11:01:25 <shapr> heh
11:01:42 <shapr> also, http://www.haskell.org/learning.html has links to many good documents on Haskell.
11:01:56 <shapr> the HaskellWiki has good info http://www.haskel.org/hawiki/
11:02:00 <shapr> lambdabot has some useful tools too
11:02:04 <CosmicRay> mflux: you will find some things very similar to ocaml
11:02:17 <CosmicRay> mflux: the type system, for instance, is very similar, with even similar syntax
11:02:26 <CosmicRay> mflux: pattern matching also is very similar
11:02:29 <shapr> If you're looking for one of those free samples they give out at ice cream stands, look here - http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellDemo
11:02:32 <mflux> well, I have checked out some examples of haskell quite some time ago and that's what I've gathered
11:02:39 <CosmicRay> mflux: but there are some significant differences
11:02:55 <CosmicRay> mflux: Haskell lists are basically like OCaml queues
11:03:07 <CosmicRay> mflux: but you get to use all the good list-manipulation operators on them
11:03:24 <CosmicRay> haskell strings are lists of characters
11:03:31 <CosmicRay> which is a nice abstraction that always pissed me off in ocaml
11:03:36 <CosmicRay> (because ocaml lacked it)
11:03:52 <CosmicRay> so the string concatenation operator is the list concatenation operator and you can use strings in patterns
11:03:59 <CosmicRay> (well, in more patterns)
11:04:24 <mflux> it is only certain types of applications string manipulation really matters
11:04:46 <CosmicRay> true, but there are a lot of apps of those types :-)
11:04:46 <mflux> but, if you're doing it, then it's nice to have the features ;)
11:05:10 <CosmicRay> (that is, of course, why the world has perl....)
11:05:43 <shapr> mflux: so, any questions?
11:05:56 <mflux> not yet
11:06:06 <shapr> ok, feel free to ask when you think of some.
11:15:20 <shapr> mflux: do you have an interest in any particular type of application?
11:16:18 <mflux> hmm.. network servers maybe
11:16:20 <kristnjov> hm, what could be wrong if i get "syntax error in expression" but no line number?
11:17:01 <mflux> shapr, so what would be the best tool to play with haskell? hugs seems to be an interactive interpreter but I don't seem to be able to interact with it ;)
11:17:10 <shapr> I prefer GHC.
11:17:21 <bourbaki> gn8
11:17:41 <shapr> And, GHCi is not as interactive as the Python interpreter, for example.
11:17:49 <shapr> Though that may change soon.
11:18:18 <mflux> how about in comparison to ocaml toplevel?
11:18:32 <shapr> I don't know OCaml.
11:18:44 <mflux> oh
11:18:57 <mflux> I don't know python ;)
11:19:08 <CosmicRay> mflux: what's the question about ocaml toplevel?
11:19:11 * CosmicRay knows all three :-)
11:19:15 <stepcut> ocaml's top-level is more flexable that ghci's
11:19:27 <CosmicRay> yeah, for some reason the haskell interpreters odn't allow interactive assignment
11:19:30 <CosmicRay> you can't say x = 5
11:19:34 <CosmicRay> I have yet to figure out why
11:19:36 <shapr> you can, actually.
11:19:38 <stepcut> ocaml's top-level will accept anything you can put in a .ml file
11:19:40 <Lemmih> CosmicRay: let x = 5
11:19:43 <ski> s/assignment/binding/
11:19:45 <shapr> let x = 5
11:19:49 <mflux> well that explains why I had tough time trying hugs ;)
11:19:52 <CosmicRay> huh.
11:20:30 <ski> mflux : hugs doesn't accept that syntax currently, though
11:21:32 <shapr> CosmicRay: with GHCi, let x = 5 and stuff <- readFile ".zshrc"
11:21:45 * CosmicRay notes this
11:21:54 <CosmicRay> so ghci essentially provides do-type syntax?
11:21:54 <shapr> GHCi is effectively in a monadic context.
11:21:57 <CosmicRay> ah.
11:21:58 <shapr> right
11:22:06 <CosmicRay> you have a way of saying things better :-)
11:22:25 * shapr grins
11:22:39 <CosmicRay> at least I didn't say "I hear there's rumors on the Internets" like Bush did in debate #2 last week
11:23:45 <shapr> I wish I could wrap my head around this arrow-style interpreter.
11:24:00 <ski> which ?
11:24:08 * jesse99 doubts bush spends much time surfing or on irc
11:24:16 <CosmicRay> heh
11:24:20 <shapr> I'm trying to hack arrowex4.hs into a postfix interpreter.
11:24:30 <shapr> ski: http://www.scannedinavian.org/~shae/ProtoJoy.hs
11:25:22 <shapr> That was originally arrowex4.hs from the fptools testsuite.
11:25:38 <Lemmih> @index ReadP
11:25:39 <lambdabot> Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP
11:27:02 <shapr> ski: if I want to make that into a postfix interpreter that can execute code like "1 1 1 + +" I think the types need to change... ?
11:30:50 <ski> shapr : literally like that string ?
11:31:11 * ski starts looking at the link
11:31:16 <shapr> well, that's concatenative and postfix
11:31:57 <shapr> I actually want both, but I'd be happy to start with postfix.
11:32:14 <shapr> If you have some suggestions how to approach it, I'd appreciate it.
11:32:54 <ski> "(|(symbol Plus)|)" ?
11:32:58 <ski> TH ??
11:33:31 <shapr> nah, what used to be 'form' in arrows.
11:33:41 <ski> mhm
11:33:46 * shapr sings ring ring ring ring ring banana bracket!
11:33:59 <kristnjov> banana bracket? wtf?
11:34:05 <kristnjov> sing "smÂ grodorna"
11:35:04 <shapr> you haven't heard the banana bracket song?
11:35:16 <ski> nope
11:36:10 <shapr> actually, it's ring ring ring bananaphone
11:36:38 <shapr> http://www.lemonizer.com/banana/
11:36:48 * ski imagines banana and lense brackets playing around in functional outer space
11:37:51 * shapr is suddenly tempted to learn Flash animation just to animate Banana Brackets in Outer Space
11:37:55 <shapr> hiya gintas 
11:38:59 <Cale> I think we should ban iprism.cox-sd.net from editing hawiki
11:39:17 * shapr immediately dose so
11:40:00 <shapr> actually, I should do the banned content thing, that's more permanent.
11:41:07 <shapr> but first!
11:42:30 <desrt> scott wants to do the c compiler =)
11:42:36 <shapr> funny, when I look at HaWiki diffs nowadays, I always read  (spamming 2 versions)
11:42:44 <desrt> (he's sitting directly to my left shaking his head no with a look of fear on his face)
11:42:49 <shapr> Greetings Ryan.
11:42:53 <shapr> Greetings Scott.
11:43:04 <desrt> scott nods his head
11:43:13 <shapr> Scott, we've heard of your brilliant Haskillz...

11:44:17 <shapr> thebug: Zope, Haskell, Cabal, HEmacs, Swedish class...
11:44:21 <shapr> Cale: already did that...
11:44:24 * shapr laughs
11:44:33 <thebug> you're up to good fun I see :)

11:46:33 <shapr> thebug: any code today?
11:46:43 <shapr> oh, I skimmed OOHaskell today.
11:46:57 <Lemmih> Heh. Cabal is cool.
11:47:09 <thebug> not today, no
11:48:17 <thebug> ./class&
11:48:20 <thebug> (!)
11:48:35 <Lemmih> Adding the fields 'homepage', 'description' and 'tested with' was really easy.
11:50:45 <Philippa> shapr: will read it paying attention to the methodology at some point. TH for sugar, anyone?
11:55:33 <ski> shapr : OOHaskell ?
11:55:46 <Lemmih> @index catch
11:55:47 <lambdabot> Control.Exception,GHC.Exception,Prelude,System.IO,System.IO.Error,IO
11:56:07 <shapr> OOHaskell - http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/OOHaskell/
11:56:13 <shapr> I gotta put factoids into lambdabot again.
11:58:11 <ski> ty
11:58:11 <kosmikus> shapr: is it any good?
11:58:39 * Lemmih fights the urge to ask shapr yet again.
11:59:52 <shapr> Lemmih: ask me what?
12:00:27 <Lemmih> I'm not gonna ask you.
12:00:34 <shapr> what what what?
12:00:58 <shapr> kosmikus: I've decided I want to be a PhD student under Oleg Kiselyow.
12:01:04 <shapr> er "Kiselyov"
12:01:19 <Lemmih> I'm about to choose the lesser of two evils.
12:01:51 * shapr blinks cluelessly
12:01:59 <Lor> shapr, so you're going to the navy? :)
12:03:33 <shapr> er, is Oleg in with Okasaki?
12:04:22 <Lor> I seem to recall from somewhere that Oleg would be involved with the armed forces.
12:04:31 <Lor> I might be mistaken, though.
12:04:45 <shapr> I think you're right.
12:05:21 <Lor> It's pretty hard to find out anything about Oleg the person. For a long time no one even knew his surname. :)
12:05:46 <shapr> wow
12:06:33 <Lor> For me at least there was just this mysterious net-entity called "oleg@pobox.com" that posted lots of weird stuff.
12:06:43 <shapr> yah, same here.
12:07:46 <ski> mm
12:11:33 <ski> shapr : "ring ring ring ring Banana phone" seems to be playing at a webradio, atm :)
12:11:43 <shapr> haha
12:12:11 <ski> was that the song you mentioned before ?
12:12:23 <kristnjov> well he did say banana bracket
12:12:31 <shapr> ring ring ring banana bracket
12:12:38 <shapr> that's for (| |) in arrows.
12:12:56 <kristnjov> i've never seen any bananas looking like that :(
12:13:05 <kristnjov> looks more like cuts of melon
12:13:11 <kristnjov> or bunny ears
12:13:44 * ski grows irritated on the song ..
12:14:34 <shapr> hah
12:14:43 <shapr> yes, the song gets tiring after a bit.
12:14:52 <shapr> there are lots more though.
12:14:59 <shapr> badger badger badger  for example.
12:15:28 <Philippa> though that one's at least a laugh to filk
12:15:35 <stepcut> I think I'd like to play some commander keen...
12:15:45 <ski> gaah ! must .. switch ..
12:15:59 <shapr> no more banana phone!
12:16:05 <shapr> time for something else!
12:16:12 <ski> xmms won't respond !!
12:16:25 <shapr> uh oh!
12:16:27 <shapr> save yourself!
12:16:40 <Cale> http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/46/
12:17:25 * ski searches frantically for a volume control
12:19:10 <shapr> greetings icb 
12:19:29 <ski> (it seems to have hanged xmms, 'cuz it should be playing a new song by now ..)
12:19:42 <shapr> maybe your web browser got stuck onthe flash animation?
12:20:52 <ski> it even continues after i killed xmms
12:20:58 <ski> how horrible !
12:21:08 <shapr> geez, that's painful
12:24:05 <Cale> http://www.weebls-stuff.com/toons/47/ more painful than this?
12:24:44 * ski hears both at the same time. maximally painful !
12:24:59 * ski hates weebl, btw
12:27:15 <shapr> I somehow broke my flash player.
12:27:23 <shapr> restarting galeon does not fix it.
12:27:28 <shapr> scary.
12:29:20 <shapr> what does ez4 stand for?
12:29:29 <kristnjov> easy for U
12:29:37 * ski aahhhs
12:29:38 <kristnjov> .. :\
12:29:50 <kristnjov> if i died this instance, would anyone miss me?
12:29:51 <ez4> it's my initials
12:29:52 <shapr> oh, so ... haskell is ez4 someone?
12:29:53 <ski> (killing "esd" finally made the nightmare stop)
12:30:15 <ez4> the forth group thought it was a forth implementation :)
12:30:21 <shapr> kristnjov: instance death is pretty common in OOP. Happily, you're in #haskell. Here we have a generational garbage collector.
12:30:39 <kristnjov> :|
12:30:42 <kristnjov> i see.
12:30:44 <shapr> kristnjov: this means you must have children before you can be garbage. Go find a woman!
12:30:44 <kristnjov> so would you miss me?
12:31:11 <shapr> Well, if you're going to write Haskell code in the future, yah, probably so.
12:31:26 <kristnjov> oh.
12:31:49 <shapr> What can I say... I'm easy. Just give me code.
12:32:28 <kristnjov> foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3,4], simplify that code
12:32:37 <shapr> too easy!
12:32:49 <shapr> ez4: learning Haskell?
12:33:36 <ez4> i know haskell
12:33:39 <shapr> kristnjov: anyway, if you're down and troubled, or you need a helping hand... try alcohol. Hangovers are usually much worse than any emotional pain.
12:33:45 * shapr is joking, btw.
12:34:04 <kristnjov> i know :P
12:34:08 <Philippa> booze bad...
12:34:11 <shapr> ez4: neat, what code?
12:34:13 * Philippa takes another sip of her beer
12:34:34 <shapr> ez4: oh, you're on LtU
12:34:56 <ez4> i don't actually write code, i seem to just learn languages for the heck of it :)
12:35:10 <shapr> Hm, I have to write code to learn a language.
12:35:41 <tuomov> you can learn and you can learn
12:35:44 <ez4> i wrote some interpreters in haskell
12:35:52 <shapr> oh cool
12:36:07 <ez4> i ported some ml typechecking stuff to see how it compared
12:36:14 <shapr> did it work?
12:36:18 <Lemmih> What information would be nice to have on libraries?
12:36:46 <ez4> it worked great.  haskell is a really nice language for that sort of thing
12:37:12 <shapr> Lemmih: description, dependencies, author, url, maybe even source repo url, compatibility...
12:37:43 <Lemmih> shapr: Doesn maintainer count as author?
12:37:52 <shapr> not always.
12:38:06 <shapr> I'm maintainer of hws-wp, and haven't written any of it.
12:38:47 <Lemmih> OK. I've added 'author'.
12:39:41 <Lemmih> Anything else? (I got the rest you mentioned)
12:40:04 <shapr> research paper =)
12:40:24 <Lemmih> Related urls?
12:40:38 <shapr> ok, that's part of description maybe
12:45:28 <Lemmih> That's it?
12:48:37 <Boegel> does anyone know why bourbaki wanted to know who wrote a ray tracer in Haskell (being me) ?
12:52:28 <Boegel> shapr ? does you have any idea ?
12:52:48 <Lemmih> I guess he just wanted to checkout some cool code...
12:52:57 <Boegel> is it that cool ? :)
12:53:13 <Lemmih> I don't know. Haven't looked at it yet (-:
12:53:25 <Boegel> you should !
12:53:44 <Lemmih> But Haskell code is in general quite cool.
12:53:46 <Boegel> you can give me hints what I could do better ! or how I can make it more readable
12:53:50 <Boegel> true ;)
12:54:32 <Lemmih> I'll probably take a look at when I get the time.
12:54:50 <Boegel> do you know where you can find it ?
12:56:00 <Lemmih> Nope.
12:56:03 <Boegel> hello Pyoko
12:56:10 <Pyoko> hi
12:56:19 <Boegel> http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesis/rayCasting.hs
12:56:36 <Lemmih> Pyoko: Looking for Haskell info?
12:56:36 <kristnjov> how do i declare a list generator?
12:56:49 <Lemmih> kristnjov: A list generator?
12:56:54 <kristnjov> yes
12:57:05 <Lemmih> What's a list generator?
12:57:44 <Boegel> a function that generates a list ? seems too simple...
12:57:45 <Pyoko> nope, just started haskell on my uni course, since I'm on the network I thought I'd idle here and watch what goes on ;)
12:58:00 <kristnjov> yes, a function that generates a list
12:58:10 <kristnjov> data type Gen
12:58:12 <Boegel> whiiee ! I was right :p
12:58:19 <Lemmih> @index Gen
12:58:19 <lambdabot> Debug.QuickCheck
12:58:24 <Boegel> Pyoko, you should ask shapr for the tour...
12:58:29 <Boegel> but I think he's idle
12:58:30 <Lemmih> kristnjov: Did you define it yourself?
12:58:34 <shapr> Boegel: you wish
12:58:44 <Boegel> oh, I shouldn't have said that :o)
12:58:47 <kristnjov> Lemmih, yes
12:58:49 * shapr appears from nowhere and surprises Boegel 
12:59:05 * Jan_w oogles
12:59:08 * Boegel feels his heart pounding like crazy
12:59:09 <Lemmih> kristnjov: Well how did you define it? Perhaps you could post it on the wiki.
12:59:26 <kristnjov> sure hold
13:00:44 <kristnjov> where is the wiki? :P
13:01:10 <Boegel> @wiki
13:01:10 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
13:01:11 <Lemmih> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
13:01:12 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
13:01:18 <Boegel> almost :p
13:01:22 <Boegel> I'm learning though ;)
13:02:06 <kristnjov> Boegel, okay, pasted
13:02:11 <kristnjov> Lemmih, pasted
13:02:54 <Lemmih> kristnjov: Is that inside the IO monad?
13:03:03 <kristnjov> dunno what a monad is :/
13:03:14 <kristnjov> i think i've fixed it though
13:03:25 <Lemmih> And how's arbitrary defined?
13:04:46 <TheHunter> in this case, arbitrary produces a random list.
13:05:09 <Jan_w> kristnjov: http://www.nomaware.com/monads/html/ a good link someone gave my here yesterday
13:05:20 <TheHunter> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/
13:06:03 <Boegel> what was the program again for printing a whole website at once ?
13:06:06 <Lemmih> TheHunter: An infinite list?
13:06:30 <TheHunter> Lemmih: no, finite according to a certain distribution
13:07:11 <ski> Lemmih : prolly the Gen monad in QuickCheck
13:07:59 * Lemmih pipelines that input to kristnjov.
13:09:01 <Boegel> hello Etaoin
13:09:13 <Boegel> new here? (I haven't seen you here, so :p)
13:10:33 * Boegel curses his printer
13:11:19 <Etaoin> Boegel: hi. I have popped in before, but I never say anything
13:11:33 <xkb> you are a lurker :D
13:11:57 <Boegel> why not Etaoin ?
13:11:57 <xkb> like me.. I like to lurk :D
13:12:10 <Boegel> you guys should be ashamed of yourselves :p
13:12:35 <Boegel> does anybody know how you can 'reset' your printer ?
13:12:38 <xkb> :D
13:12:41 <xkb> power off?
13:12:47 <Boegel> I canceled a print job, but it keeps spitting gibberish
13:12:47 <xkb> wait a few minutes
13:12:52 <Boegel> no, it doesn't work
13:13:01 <xkb> yep.. power off is the only solution
13:13:03 <Etaoin> I don't see any shame in it
13:13:07 <Boegel> I haven't tried waited tough..
13:13:13 <xkb> unless you have a real advanced printer
13:13:15 <Boegel> why does it do that ?
13:13:26 <xkb> printer buffer usually
13:13:29 <Boegel> that must be a bug in the printer driver, no ?
13:13:43 <xkb> depends on the size of your printer buffer..
13:13:52 <Boegel> then the damn printer should print gibberish, it should print what's in it's buffer...
13:13:57 <Boegel> ah well, I'll try later
13:13:58 <xkb> if the printer has a small buffer it should be a pinterdriver err indeed
13:14:11 <Boegel> I'll go watch a nifty quiz on tv now, bye !
13:14:15 <xkb> lol
13:14:23 <Boegel> ;)
13:19:09 <Deniz> how can one taking a list of Int double each element ?
13:19:17 <Deniz> square each element..
13:19:20 <ski> map (2 *)
13:19:28 <ski> map (^ 2)
13:20:16 <ski> or, did you mean how to explicitly, using recursion e.g., define such functions ?
13:20:27 <Deniz> ok..
13:20:30 <Deniz> no..
13:20:33 <Deniz> that's it..
13:22:54 <Deniz> btw..
13:23:08 <Deniz> does anyone know how I can open .ps files in windows ?
13:24:03 <ski> google for Ghostview
13:24:11 <d3n17_> ok
13:45:55 <mikael> um.
13:45:58 <mikael> @type group . sort
13:45:59 <lambdabot> bzzt
13:46:11 <mikael> oh well:
13:46:29 <mikael> Prelude List> :t group . sort
13:46:30 <mikael> group . sort :: forall a. (Ord a) => [a] -> [[a]]
13:46:30 <mikael> Prelude List> let frob = group . sort
13:46:30 <mikael> Prelude List> :t frob
13:46:30 <mikael> frob :: [Integer] -> [[Integer]]
13:46:32 <mikael> what's up with that?
13:49:31 <ski> defaulting
13:49:56 <ski> it defaults to Integer on interactive toplevel
13:50:07 <mikael> ah, Ord a => a does?
13:50:35 <ski> that means that "Prelude> 1 + 2" will give "3" instead of some error meaning that it can't infer what kind of numbers you wanted
13:52:52 <Igloo> Ord a doesn't normally default. Only in ghci and hugs
13:52:59 <Igloo> Only Num defaults normally
13:57:11 <Lemmih> mikael: That means that 'a' must be an instance of Ord.
14:00:34 <Boegel> the quiz was great :)
14:00:35 <Boegel> :p
14:01:27 <Boegel> damn, my printer's buffer still isn't empty :s
14:05:48 <Boegel> ow, now it is
14:05:56 <Boegel> damn, those things really suck :)
14:06:49 <Boegel> hello mornfall
14:07:02 <Boegel> new here ? (I'll keep asking this until I know everybody :p)
14:15:20 <joao> good night
14:15:26 <shapr> hi joao 
14:15:49 <shapr> mikael: what version of GHC?
14:16:21 <shapr> mikael: that's weird
14:18:48 <Boegel> hello mornfall :p
14:19:10 <mikael> shapr: 6.2.1
14:19:40 <shapr> yah, I see the same thing here.
14:20:06 <shapr> mikael: let y = group ; :t y
14:20:08 <shapr> same thing
14:20:20 <shapr> same for sort as well.
14:20:33 <mikael> odd :)
14:23:10 <Boegel> if Hugs an GHCI wouldn't do that, it wouldn't be possible to execute simple commands I think
14:25:34 <Boegel> how do you change the message you give when you're exiting ?
14:25:53 <shapr> you can use /signoff
14:26:11 <monochrom> Settings -> Preferences -> General
14:27:11 <Boegel> let's test it :)
14:27:21 <monochrom> It works.
14:27:24 <monochrom> It works.
14:27:31 <Boegel> what did it say ? :)
14:27:59 <monochrom> lleksah# noos uoy ees
14:28:05 <Boegel> :p
14:28:11 <Boegel> you forgot the ! ;)
14:28:25 <monochrom> probably a bug
14:29:29 <Boegel> monochrom, you are just _BAD_ :o
14:30:46 <shapr> I can never remember the right way to do make register with hs-plugins
14:32:18 <shapr> dons: hs-plugins darcs repo?
14:32:58 <Lemmih> Eeek. Halipeto is complex.
14:32:58 <Boegel> shapr, would you do something for me ?
14:33:04 <shapr> Boegel: no.
14:33:07 * shapr laughs evilly
14:33:11 <Boegel> oh, okay then ?
14:33:16 <Boegel> Lemmih, would you ? :p
14:33:19 <shapr> Boegel: what do you want?
14:33:22 <Boegel> :)
14:33:38 <Boegel> if bourbaki returns, tell him where he can find my code
14:33:42 <shapr> ah, ok.
14:34:03 <Boegel> do you know where, or should i post it on the irc Wiki ?
14:34:23 <shapr> hm, put it on the wiki?
14:34:33 <Boegel> okay :)
14:35:03 <Boegel> if bourbaki has seen the code, would you remove the url from the wiki for me ?
14:35:21 <Lemmih> I think Halipeto would benefit from a simple tutorial.
14:35:33 <shapr> Lemmih: I actually persuaded andrew to write one.
14:35:40 <shapr> it's in the FAQ section.
14:35:58 <shapr> anyway, I can hook you up with Halipeto goodness
14:36:34 <Boegel> shapr: if bourbaki has seen the code, would you remove the url from the wiki for me ?
14:36:38 <shapr> sure
14:36:53 <Boegel> okay
14:37:08 <Boegel> I don't wont everyone to be able to find that code, just to be safe
14:37:15 <Lemmih> Oh, the Hello World thingy looks good.
14:37:18 <Boegel> only people who ask for it :)
14:37:23 <shapr> heh, ok
14:37:28 <Boegel> what is Halipeto ?
14:37:30 <Boegel> GUI system ? :p
14:37:33 <Lemmih> Then it's probably a bad idea to post it on the wiki...
14:37:37 <shapr> nah, web page templates.
14:37:56 <Boegel> Lemmih, I just don't want it to be there all the time
14:38:08 <Boegel> it doesn't matter if it's there for a few hours, that's not so bad
14:38:34 <Boegel> I don't want it to be a secret, but neither do I want it to spread like fire ;)
14:40:04 <Boegel> Lemmih: it's just because I won't be able to visit here in the next few days (probably until saturday evening)
14:40:11 <Boegel> and borubaki seemed interested in it
14:40:20 <Boegel> hello ned (flanders ?)
14:40:27 <ned> no, sorry :)
14:40:29 <ned> hello
14:40:43 <shapr> bonjour ned!
14:40:50 <shapr> ned: haven't seen you in a long time.
14:40:51 <ned> hey shapr
14:40:57 <ned> you remember ! :)
14:41:01 <shapr> of course!
14:41:02 <ned> yep
14:41:15 <shapr> I still have your OpenGL Go Client code around here somewhere.
14:41:21 <ned> hehe
14:41:35 <ned> i h'aven't work on it -since, i'm afraid
14:41:39 <shapr> how's code?
14:41:43 <shapr> well, I haven't worked on it either.
14:41:48 <ned> well
14:41:56 <ned> really want to code
14:42:03 <shapr> I kept meaning to at least read the network part to see how you did synchronization.
14:42:04 <ned> don't really find something to
14:42:11 <ned> a bit of frustration ..
14:42:18 <shapr> you want to code Haskell?
14:42:22 <ned> so  i come back for ideas :)
14:42:28 <ned> of course 
14:42:30 <ned> :)
14:42:35 <Boegel> ray tracing is fun ned :p
14:42:39 <Boegel> but I'm on that one ;)
14:42:43 <shapr> have you ever had the urge to write an editor in Haskell?
14:42:44 <ned> :)
14:42:54 <ned> i begin one yes
14:42:58 <ned> a text editor
14:43:05 <ned> did i talked about it 
14:43:06 <ned> ?
14:43:09 <shapr> <dons> hemacs is born : darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hemacs
14:43:19 <ned> whaou
14:43:27 <ned> really nice
14:43:27 <shapr> started yesterday =)
14:43:37 <Boegel> omg ! just yesterday?
14:43:39 <shapr> http://lists.scannedinavian.org/pipermail/post-emacs/
14:43:46 <ned> Lunar^ tells me about huge progress in haskell sometimes
14:43:48 <shapr> that's the mailing list.
14:43:56 <Boegel> link is broken ?
14:44:08 <shapr> hemacs requires the latest nightly version of hs-plugins
14:44:14 <shapr> er, wrong link
14:44:31 <CosmicRay> hmm, /me gets a mention on the /. front page
14:44:36 <shapr> http://lists.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/post-emacs
14:44:38 <CosmicRay> that hasn't happened since... ever. :-)
14:44:43 <shapr> CosmicRay: you're famous!
14:45:08 <CosmicRay> hopefully I'll not be banned from haskell-libs for being mentioned for a book on That Other Language :-)
14:45:21 <shapr> heh, don't think so.
14:45:58 <shapr> ned: did Lunar^ show you House?
14:46:07 <ned> yes
14:46:10 <ned> yesterday
14:46:13 <ned> quite impressive
14:46:30 <Boegel> CosmicRay = Sarusa ?
14:46:31 <shapr> yes, I hope they get permission to release the source.
14:46:36 <ned> that's why i come back today :)
14:46:41 <ned> we talked about that
14:46:46 <shapr> CosmicRay == John Goerzen
14:47:13 <Boegel> CosmicRay: you wrote a book ? :)
14:47:27 <Boegel> omg, I'm here talking with the big guys while I'm only a student :p
14:47:51 <shapr> sometimes the big guys are students...
14:48:01 <kolmodinAway> tumm_: welcome :)
14:48:02 <Boegel> shapr: example ? :)
14:48:02 <shapr> hej tumm_
14:48:06 <Boegel> hello tumm_
14:48:09 <tumm_> hej
14:48:10 <Boegel> (is he new ? :p)
14:48:20 <shapr> nah, he's been here before :-)
14:48:33 <Boegel> hello kolmodin
14:48:38 <kolmodin> hi Boegel 
14:48:39 <tumm_> heh, thats some welcoming :)
14:48:45 * shapr grins
14:48:52 <shapr> ned: have you tried hs-plugins?
14:49:01 <shapr> that's the wave of the future, imho
14:49:01 <ned> no
14:49:05 <ned> ok
14:49:09 <shapr> j'espere :-)
14:49:10 <ned> i will check :)
14:49:55 <Boegel> kolmodin: thanks for the profiling hint you gave me yesterday
14:50:04 <kolmodin> np
14:50:11 <Boegel> my promotor had never done it, and it seemed damn nifty to him :)
14:50:20 <kolmodin> :)
14:50:29 <Boegel> so I made a good impression
14:56:09 <stepcut> shapr: how long till hemacs can be developed in hemacs do you think ?
14:56:36 <shapr> I was wondering that myself.
14:56:52 <shapr> a pure edit buffer isn't too hard
14:57:10 <shapr> smart indenting and syntax highlighting will be harder.
14:57:16 <CosmicRay> Bogel: yes :-)
14:57:27 <CosmicRay> err Boegel
14:57:28 <CosmicRay> sorry
14:57:30 <Boegel> np
14:57:32 <CosmicRay> time for me to run
14:57:38 <stepcut> seems like people using it on a daily basis the best bet for keeping development rolling
14:57:38 <Boegel> same here
14:57:49 <Boegel> I should get up in 6,5 hours :s
14:57:50 <shapr> stepcut: but I have some crazy ideas... do you know of an arrow-based parsec?
14:57:56 <shapr> Boegel: so go to sleep!
14:58:00 <Boegel> and I'm having a party tomorrow night, so...
14:58:02 <shapr> then you can write better code tomorrow!
14:58:12 <stepcut> shapr: no, but I would like one
14:58:12 <Boegel> I won't be coding tomorrow
14:58:25 <Philippa> shapr: how parsec-like, exactly?
14:58:26 <Boegel> I have classes all day
14:58:27 <shapr> stepcut: yah, I'm hacking on hemacs right now, I agree with the daily usage or die.
14:58:32 <Boegel> and a party in the evening
14:58:35 <shapr> Philippa: not picky?
14:58:37 <stepcut> shapr: daily or die!
14:58:40 <shapr> yes
14:58:54 * stepcut is install hs-plugins
14:58:56 <Philippa> shapr: just wondering. Only parsec itself's good enough from here, but then I'm not doing the kinda thing you're doing
14:58:58 <stepcut> *ing*
14:59:09 <shapr> plus, I want to get hemacs working before the new plastic smell is gone on the idea
14:59:10 <Philippa> ing yourself ;-)
14:59:24 <Philippa> use parsec, then
14:59:30 <shapr> yah, might do that
14:59:49 <shapr> thoughts on doing incremental parsing with parsec?
14:59:56 <Philippa> er, my head hurts :-)
15:00:07 <shapr> incremental parsing with arrows easier?
15:00:13 <Philippa> prolly not
15:00:22 * shapr grins
15:00:23 <Philippa> just keep a "we got this far" every x way in
15:00:34 <stepcut> the hemacs README says to edit system.mk, but I do not seem to have that file...
15:00:41 <Philippa> you're prolly going to have to reparse everything after an edit though
15:01:08 <shapr> incremental parser won't require a complete reparse
15:01:23 <shapr> that's one reason I think arrows would be nice, because you could restart changed parses
15:01:29 <shapr> if that makes any sense
15:01:37 <Philippa> "you got this far, reparse from here"?
15:02:15 <shapr> well, how about "this arrow is dealing with this part of the source"
15:02:28 <shapr> so when text changes, it's like a GUI redraw,
15:02:33 <shapr> but is instead a reparse
15:02:48 <Philippa> yeah, though you then need a protocol for deciding when you've invalidated the next bit
15:03:01 <Philippa> no point - just don't parse further than you need to
15:03:24 <shapr> huh?
15:03:41 <shapr> stepcut: did you darcs pull -a ?
15:03:54 <tumm_> hums, has anyone gotten wxhaskell to build under sunos?
15:03:56 <shapr> I just ran make, it mostly worked for me...
15:04:14 <shapr> except that you need the nightly hs-plugins from last night
15:04:19 <shapr> and I'm stuck on installing that 
15:04:20 <stepcut> I got the hs-plugins
15:04:32 <shapr> it's not filling in LIBDIR for me with make register
15:04:43 <Philippa> shapr: if you're doing regex-like parsing you've a fairly trivial "don't care what came next, matched the lot" - but for other things you might be worried about eg a parenthesis god knows how far down the file
15:05:05 <stepcut> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -liconv
15:05:07 * Philippa is thinking VS.net all of a sudden though - at least feed back what the parsing error was
15:05:08 <stepcut>  :-/
15:05:40 * Boegel is going to sleep, finally
15:05:41 <shapr> Philippa: if it's like a gui redraw, then you pass the buck until the text mismatches an arrows former input, right?
15:05:46 <shapr> g'night Boegel 
15:05:55 <Boegel> bye everyone, see you on Saturday or so
15:06:00 <shapr> have fun at your party
15:06:08 <Boegel> I'll try to ;)
15:06:10 <Boegel> bye
15:06:10 <Philippa> shapr: sure, the value of "former input" could get pretty complicated though
15:06:26 <shapr> I see your point
15:06:26 <ski> shapr : i'm reminded of attibute grammars, re "you got this far, reparse from here"?
15:06:27 <Philippa> plus I'm braindead today
15:06:42 <Philippa> effectively you're going to be passing around the state of the machine doing the parsing
15:06:52 <shapr> how so?
15:07:02 <Philippa> me or ski?
15:07:15 <shapr> yes, this does sound like attribute grammars
15:07:26 <shapr> what do you mean about passing state?
15:08:19 <Philippa> for an arrow parsing a CFG via a stack machine to know if its parse is valid, it'd need to check the stack it was originally passed + the DFA position against those it's now being fed
15:08:30 <ski> shapr : (also some parser developed by Hughes(?) and others, that used a Polish notation inspired datatype ..)
15:08:49 <Philippa> to put it another way, it'd check it's at the right bracket levels, stuff like that
15:08:54 <shapr> ski: oh tell me more...
15:09:04 * shapr googles
15:09:14 <ski> shapr : lemme see if i can find the link ..
15:10:47 <shapr> Philippa: oh
15:11:22 <Philippa> "am I still coming from a similar enough place?" :-)
15:11:53 <shapr> thing is, if there's an incremental forward parse, you can start from the next parser up from where things changed
15:11:54 <ski> shapr : hmm http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Functional/Meeting/2000/index.html#John-Oct-26
15:13:11 <stepcut> shapr: is there a sample hemacs.conf ?
15:13:25 <shapr> stepcut: I did 'make hemacs.conf'
15:13:30 <shapr> and that produced one for me
15:13:52 <Philippa> shapr: right, you don't reparse everything, you just reparse everything from a certain point
15:14:02 <stepcut> shapr: indeed, thanks
15:14:15 <Philippa> but for that all you really need is a bunch of parser continuations or something similar
15:14:37 <shapr> but, it's entirely possible you can reparse *to* a certain point as well
15:14:47 <ski> shapr : think there was some .ps/.pdf that this talk came from, trying to find that now ..
15:14:54 <Philippa> yeah. What I was saying about passing a bunch of state around
15:14:57 <shapr> ski: this really reminds me of concatenative languages
15:15:10 <Philippa> (and you hope like hell you didn't do a reparse while all the text is malformed :-)
15:19:46 <ski> shapr : hm, i think this could be the one (though i remember some more colorful slides ..) http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/afp/Literature/p224-swierstra.pdf
15:19:53 <ski> shapr : ok, how so ?
15:20:09 <stepcut> shapr: this is the right darcs archive, yes? http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/code/hemacs
15:20:25 <shapr> yup
15:20:29 <shapr> stepcut: having problems?
15:20:51 <stepcut> shapr: yes. it says run make ; make install, but the Makefile does not even have an install target :)
15:21:00 <shapr> :-)
15:21:09 <shapr> well, there's the first patch?
15:21:35 <stepcut> shapr: and then I tried make Main.o, but it depends on a bunch of stuff in HEmacs which has not been built, and there is no rule to build 
15:21:56 <shapr> well that part is sort of on purpose, I think
15:22:02 <shapr> I dunno about no rule to buil
15:22:03 <shapr> build
15:22:06 <stepcut> shapr: so then I built things piece by piece, but when I run it I get: Starting up dynamic Haskell ... /root/projects/haskell/hemacs/Main.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_BootAPI_'
15:22:08 <ski> shapr : also, re incremental attribute grammars, lets not forget Adaptive Functional Programming http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers.htm#afp and Monads for Incremental Computing http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~magnus/papers/icfp-2002.pdf
15:22:35 <stepcut> shapr: you said you just type 'make' and it worked ?
15:22:40 <shapr> stepcut: the latest riot doesn't have static bits
15:22:53 <shapr> stepcut: actually, it just got far enough for me to realize I needed the latest hs-plugins
15:22:59 <stepcut> shapr: ah
15:23:18 <shapr> HEmacs was building this morning, then I pulled the latest patches, and now it's not
15:23:26 <stepcut> ah
15:23:37 <stepcut> so maybe I need to back out some changes ?
15:23:42 <shapr> maybe so?
15:23:59 <stepcut> or wait till tomorrow ;)
15:25:47 <stepcut> this metal show is half-descent, I wish it was 128KB stearming mp3 instead of 32K realaudio :(
15:25:53 <shapr> I think hs-plugins needs a fix too... with make register ${LIBDIR} doesn't get set for me in the latest nightyl
15:26:05 <shapr> have you tried magnatune?
15:26:06 <stepcut> hrm
15:26:22 <stepcut> I sent my cd to magnatune but they never wrote back :p
15:26:48 <shapr> he does seem covered up with work
15:26:54 <stepcut> heh
15:26:56 <shapr> I do wish he'd put up more CDs
15:27:01 <stepcut> or my cd sucks ;)
15:27:25 <shapr> I thought it was pretty good when I listened to the bits you had online.
15:28:09 <stepcut> thanks, I like it too :)
15:28:38 <stepcut> but we won't have time to promote it for atleast 9 months... but hopefully we will be smart enough to do it then
15:28:44 <shapr> ski: http://factor.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?ConcatenativeLanguage
15:31:16 <shapr> if each number is a function that pushes that number onto a stack, and + is a function that removes the top two numbers from a stack and pushes their sum...
15:31:36 <shapr> hm, maybe that doesn't fit there.
15:32:58 <ski> shapr : hm, i meant as related to incremental/adaptive. though i of course see how it feels related to reverse polish and so ..
15:33:19 <shapr> oh
15:35:30 <Lemmih> Heh Halipeto is cool.
15:35:48 <Lemmih> I'm finally starting to understand how it works.
15:35:53 <desrt> so.  dr. kahl thinks the compiler is a cool idea
15:36:04 <desrt> and i've been thinking
15:36:10 * stepcut is now actually subscribed to post-emacs
15:36:18 <desrt> complex expressions are going to be the most difficult part
15:36:35 <stepcut> Lemmih: cool, I hope to start using it in the next two weeks
15:36:41 <desrt> like ((a+b)*(c&d<<2))^0xfff
15:36:56 <shapr> stepcut: yay!
15:37:20 <desrt> i'm going to abuse the stack.
15:39:15 <desrt> unless i can find a proof that evaluating subexpressions will only ever use 3 registers max (or 4 or whatever)
15:39:27 <desrt> which i do not believe to be true
15:43:20 <shapr> desrt: if you abuse the stack enough...
15:44:22 <desrt> i think such an algorithm might exist
15:44:35 <desrt> i was thinking, pathalogical case:
15:44:43 <desrt> (a+b)*(c+d)*(e+f)*(g+h)
15:44:56 <desrt> in order to do this you need to eval a+b then c+d then e+f then g+h then multiply them all
15:45:00 <desrt> but....
15:45:00 <desrt> it's really more like:
15:45:05 <Cale> desrt: heh, I basically had a stack especially for the evaluation of expressions in the little compiler I wrote. Beautifully inefficient. You could also implement the expression operators as function calls, if you really want to be cheap :)
15:45:08 <desrt> (((a+b)*(c+d))*(e+f))*(g+h)
15:45:28 <desrt> Cale; dynamic recursion is definitely ruled out :)
15:45:51 <desrt> anyway... point here is that all operators are binary
15:45:57 <desrt> which means that at most they take 2 arguments
15:46:03 <Igloo> You can't evaluate an arbitrary tree in a fixed number of registers
15:46:09 <desrt> so i need to calculate a+b and c+d
15:46:14 <desrt> (2 registers)
15:46:18 <desrt> then * them to get 1 register
15:46:28 <desrt> then e+f is the 2nd register again
15:46:31 <desrt> and * back to 1
15:46:33 <desrt> etc
15:46:55 <Igloo> That only works because it's a left-tree, though
15:47:14 <desrt> Igloo; what about an arbitrary tree in which the leaves are available for free and each node can only have 2 children?
15:47:28 <Igloo> That's what I meant
15:48:01 <Igloo> Suppose you need n registers for each of the left and right sub-trees. Then you need n+1 for the complete tree
15:48:30 <desrt> right.
15:48:32 <Igloo> (1 to store the left result while you work out the right result in the remaining n)
15:48:39 <desrt> i had convinced myself of this on the bus
15:48:46 <desrt> but i just thought i had found a loophole :P
15:49:17 <desrt> (a+b) * ( (expression) + (expression) )
15:49:28 <desrt> you need to store (a+b) at the same time as you store the 2 expressions
15:49:43 <desrt> so
15:49:44 <desrt> stack it is :)
15:50:10 <Cale> you can use the call stack if you're planning to support procedure calls anyway
15:50:18 <desrt> cale; nod.
15:50:25 <desrt> i might use registers, too
15:50:30 <desrt> this is an easy case
15:50:50 <desrt> i can avoid using the stack if i have a bunch of registers (unless the expressions get REALLY bad)
15:51:15 <desrt> and this is still much easier than using registers for long-term storage of named variables
15:52:22 <desrt> i convinced scott that we need to do this for RISC
15:52:36 <desrt> so we're looking at about 30ish useable registers :P
15:53:01 <shapr> so, when does Scott show up here?
15:53:20 <desrt> he's been here before.  i forget which nick he goes by
15:53:28 <Cale> he was here earlier -- thebug?
15:53:36 <desrt> saynte
15:53:51 <shapr> oh him!
15:54:06 <shapr> he did the GtkMozEmbed hack.
15:54:15 <desrt> 09:54:12 <shapr> saynte: psst, do you have a working gtk2hs version of gtkmozembed?
15:54:18 <Cale> yeah, I thought it was saynte
15:54:39 <Cale> but I was probably confused by an earlier conversation here :)
15:56:24 <shapr> greetings skylan 
15:57:21 <desrt> i suppose it's fitting that i have a computer architecture assignment due tomorrow and i don't want to do it because i feel like writing a compiler instead =)
15:58:24 <desrt> for everything i plan on having weird snips of assembly code
15:58:39 <desrt> like || will be defined something like:
15:59:03 <desrt> "A; if result then branch to end; B; end: return result"
15:59:09 <desrt> and + will be like
15:59:17 <desrt> "A; B; add result, result1, result2"
15:59:21 <desrt> so really they're little templates
15:59:31 <desrt> and A and B are the result of 'compiling' the subexpressions
16:00:20 <desrt> if will be like an operation quite like &&
16:00:23 <Cale> desrt: yep, that's how it's basically done
16:00:55 <desrt> while will be a chunk of code like "A; if result==0 goto end; B; goto top; end:"
16:01:08 <desrt> that's what while(A){B} looks like
16:01:38 <desrt> of course that's not the nicest way to write a while loop.. but whatever :)
16:06:37 <monochrom> Indeed, if you're asked to hand in an assembly program, don't write it by hand.
16:06:56 <monochrom> write a compiler instead.
16:07:28 <monochrom> chances are the generated code is the least spaghetti in the whole class.
16:07:48 <desrt> our assembly programs are like 3-liners
16:07:51 <desrt> in MIPs
16:07:57 <desrt> MIPS, even
16:08:04 <monochrom> if you also add in a few comments here and there, it may also become the most readable.  you'll get high marks.
16:08:33 <desrt> it's like "write a program that converts a number to its absolute value"
16:08:56 <monochrom> Ah, those are do-able by hand.
16:09:41 <desrt> the cool part is that once you've written a powerpc compiler, you already have a mips compiler
16:09:56 <desrt> you could practically port it by inserting a bunch of regular expressions between the compiler and the assembler :)
16:15:57 <shapr> stepcut: do you have iconv installed? you're using redhat?
16:17:22 <shapr> yay, I got Main.o to build.
16:18:04 <stepcut> shapr: debian, I just commented out the -iconv in the makefile, because it is only needed for OpenBSD, glibc has iconv built-in
16:18:15 <shapr> oh
16:18:45 <stepcut> any luck getting hemacs to actually run ?
16:20:57 <shapr> where did you comment out iconv?
16:22:25 <desrt> i now think it is a good idea to treeify a function
16:22:36 <desrt> ; is an operator
16:22:46 <desrt> A;B means do A first, then B
16:23:05 <desrt> which i can represent trivially in my template assembly
16:23:25 <shapr> gahr

16:24:00 <shapr> stepcut: getting closer =)
16:24:19 <stepcut> shapr: interesting... different but similar error to what I got
16:24:25 <stepcut> are you using hemacs-inplace?
16:24:29 <shapr> yup
16:24:38 <shapr> but it still wants ~/.hemacs/Config.hs
16:25:56 <stepcut> what happens if you don't have a Config.hs ?
16:26:13 <shapr> it should use the default
16:27:29 <stepcut> I meant what actually happens. If I have ~/.hemacs/Config.hs then I get what you got, but if I don't have it then, I get a similar error about BootAPI
16:28:12 <shapr> oh

16:30:28 <shapr> desrt: that's just because you don't understand darcs yet =)
16:30:37 <desrt> i understand arch
16:30:48 <shapr> darcs > arch
16:30:49 <shapr> :-P
16:31:11 <tuomov> I can't stand arch..
16:31:22 <tuomov> darcs is nice, though
16:31:25 <shapr> dons: hey, "Starting up dynamic Haskell ... /home/shae/.hemacs/Config.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_HEmacsziConfigAPI_' \n Fail: user error (resolveObjs failed with <<False>>)"
16:31:57 <shapr> dons: what am I doing wrong?
16:32:19 <dons> so Config.o isnt pulling in -package hemacs ConfigAPI
16:32:25 <dons> what ghc are you using?
16:32:48 <dons> there seems to be some issues with how dependencies are generated between 6.2.1 -> head
16:32:52 <desrt> oh crap
16:33:01 <desrt> they extended the deadline to nov 15th >:|
16:33:10 <stepcut> dons: how are we even supposed to build/install the thing? 'make' seems to only make the depend file...
16:33:24 <stepcut> and there is no 'make install' target :)
16:33:24 <dons> it got a new build system yesterday ...
16:33:28 <dons> make boot all
16:33:32 <shapr> oh
16:33:34 * shapr tries
16:33:35 <dons> no install target yet, its coming in
16:33:59 <dons> I rewrote the build system to find srcs automagically, rather than having explicit lists
16:34:04 <shapr> we can get rid of -liconv on linux?
16:34:04 <stepcut> do I need to install stuff my hand in some places then? Or can i do hemacs-inplace ?
16:34:05 <dons> I think it will be better in the long run
16:34:15 <dons> shapr: you dont need it
16:34:32 <dons> hemacs-inplace should work fine for now
16:34:59 <dons> make boot all ; ./hemacs-inplace is working for me
16:35:20 <stepcut> dons: linux or openbsd ?
16:35:23 <dons> i'll do some more portability testing, and get the install target back in
16:35:28 <stepcut> Starting up dynamic Haskell ... /root/projects/haskell/hemacs/./HShemacs.o: unknown symbol `libiconv'
16:35:30 <shapr> ghc -o hemacs-static -L/usr/local/lib -lncurses -liconv -package-conf hemacs.conf -package hemacs -package posix Main.o \n /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -liconv
16:35:42 <dons> ok o
16:35:54 <dons> linux people dont need -liconv (edit config.mk)
16:36:06 <dons> linux people dont need to set WEIRD_ICONV in config.mk
16:36:15 * dons thinks linux config.mk should be the default 
16:36:31 <stepcut> dons: yeah, I commented it out those two lines in config.mk but I now I get that error I jsut pasted
16:36:40 <tuomov> usually it is openbsd where nothing ever works :)
16:36:45 <dons> hehe
16:36:55 <dons> it really works nicely on openbsd now
16:36:58 <tuomov> it's the 21st century and wchar_t is still missing
16:37:08 <dons> yah yah... its all politics
16:37:11 <stepcut> I could try it on my freebsd box...
16:37:57 <stepcut> HEmacs/IConv.hs:foreign import ccall unsafe "iconv.h libiconv" c_iconv
16:38:16 <dons> yes. because you must have WEIRD_ICONV set ?
16:38:16 <stepcut> could that line be screwing things up if I don't have a libiconv ?
16:38:18 <dons> in config.mk
16:38:32 <dons> but you do need a libiconv, afaik
16:38:42 <tuomov> err.. shouldn't that be just iconv?
16:38:47 <tuomov> that's how it still is in riot..
16:38:52 <dons> tuomov: openbsd binding is what he is seeing
16:39:02 <dons> which you get if you -DWEIRD_ICONV
16:39:07 <dons> that hasnt been merged back to riot yet
16:39:44 <dons> ok linux people. give me 5 mins and i'll fix up the default config.mk in the repo
16:39:52 * dons mutters something about linux
16:40:09 <shapr> I still get "Starting up dynamic Haskell ... /home/shae/.hemacs/Config.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_HEmacsziConfigAPI_' \n Fail: user error (resolveObjs failed with <<False>>)"
16:40:43 <stepcut> ah, I had to delete IConv.hs after modifying config.mk so that it would be regenerated correctly
16:40:49 * Igloo senses much hostility in the channel. I think we should all have a big group hug and whinge about Windows users.
16:40:57 * shapr laughs
16:41:05 <dons> stepcut: make clean
16:41:14 <stepcut> dons: :p
16:41:16 <dons> or touch IConv.hsc
16:41:22 <stepcut> dons: it works now !
16:41:31 <dons> anyway -- it is running nicely on linux with ghc-6.2.1 for me right now
16:41:33 <stepcut> :)
16:41:36 <dons> stepcut: yay!
16:42:36 <stepcut> dons: If you simply updated the README, that would probably be good enough :)
16:43:46 <dons> hehe. this thing only started yesterday. i've been flat out :P
16:43:58 <stepcut> heh
16:44:04 <dons> ok. linux-specific config.mk patch in the repo
16:44:28 <dons> tested on Linux 2.4.26 with ghc-6.2.1 and the heatwave release of hs-plugins
16:45:02 <dons> though hopefully the kernel rev doesn't matter
16:46:34 <stepcut> i am running linux 2.6.7
16:46:43 <stepcut> and ghc 6.2.1
16:47:09 <stepcut> 2.6.8 actually
16:47:41 <dons> how you going shapr?
16:48:28 <shapr> just about to find out
16:49:06 * Igloo calculates ghc would need about 64G of RAM to compile all my unit tests. Hmm.
16:49:23 <stepcut> heh
16:51:58 <desrt> how do i do trees?
16:52:39 <shapr> desrt: well, first you start with a seed.
16:52:55 <desrt> shapr; then what?
16:53:26 <Cale> desrt: then you put it in the ground and pour water on it
16:53:39 <desrt> Cale; is this like the root of the tree?
16:54:07 <Cale> eventually
16:54:29 <shapr> dons: Starting up dynamic Haskell ... /home/shae/.hemacs/Config.o: unknown symbol `__stginit_HEmacsziConfigAPI_' Fail: user error (resolveObjs failed with <<False>>)
16:54:46 <desrt> mm.  doing C without types isn't going to work
16:54:59 <desrt> char and int might be close enough, but char * and int * are quite a different story
16:55:09 <Cale> for a more realistic answer, see Data.Tree for the basic idea. A binary tree might be  data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
16:55:31 <shapr> ah, whacking ~/.hemacs fixed it.
16:55:45 <desrt> Cale; lame tree.  i want to store data in the non-leaf nodes :)
16:55:57 <Cale> data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
16:56:00 <desrt> so Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
16:56:01 <desrt> ya...
16:56:18 <desrt> actually, more like
16:56:29 <desrt> data Tree a b = Leaf a | Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)
16:59:59 <Cale> sure
17:00:22 <Cale> or you could do  data Tree a b = Leaf a | Branch b [Tree a b], for rose trees
17:01:20 <Cale> I'm not sure if I completely agree with the use of = there, but I'm not sure if I could suggest any better notation :)
17:01:21 <desrt> i will have between 0 and 2 children for each node
17:01:43 <shapr> dons: I think your patch isn't ugo+r
17:01:58 * desrt hands shae 'a'
17:01:58 <dons> ah. nope. forgot
17:02:41 <desrt> i was hoping to avoid types
17:02:42 <dons> try that
17:02:59 <desrt> by saying that there are really only 3 types
17:03:01 <desrt> voids, values, lvalues
17:03:16 <desrt> and lvalues can be values and values can be voids
17:03:17 <dons> shapr: what is the output of ghc --show-iface /home/shae/.hemacs/Config.hi | grep depend
17:03:31 <desrt> and (;) for example :: void -> void -> void
17:07:30 <shapr> dons: actually, Config.hi is in /home/shae/.hemacs/HEmacs/Config.hi
17:08:00 <dons> how did it get there?
17:08:08 <dons> hmm...
17:08:18 <shapr> module HEmacs.Config where
17:08:34 <dons> oh. wrong Config. try using plugins/Config.hs
17:09:25 <dons> hmm. bug. should be:
17:09:26 <dons> module Config where
17:09:26 <dons> import HEmacs.ConfigAPI
17:09:44 <dons> the config module isnt part of -package hemacs
17:09:49 <shapr> ok
17:10:09 <dons> (i.e. like plugins/Date.hs)
17:10:19 <shapr> yay!
17:10:23 <dons> :D
17:10:40 <dons> hierarchical names would really confuse make and load
17:11:10 <dons> shapr: working? both hemacs-static and hemacs-inplace?
17:11:24 <shapr> well, I'm trying to change styles now...
17:11:33 <shapr> yes, they both work
17:12:28 <dons> great. so, todo: make install target, fix hs-plugins register target and have the README match reality
17:13:48 <shapr> the hs-plugins register target is easy, ${PREFIX} or whatever in the Makefile should be ${LIBDIR}
17:13:56 <shapr> do you have a darcs repo for hs-plugins?
17:14:10 <dons> got it
17:14:42 <dons> doh. I actually wrote the patch yesterday, and didn't commit it
17:14:47 <shapr> :-)
17:20:21 <stepcut> shapr: i tried to send mail to post-emacs@lists.scannedinavian.org but it was rejected
17:20:25 <stepcut> :(
17:20:29 <shapr> :-(
17:20:31 * shapr checks
17:29:10 * stepcut goes home
18:06:11 <juhp> how does one get darcs to default to accepting all patches
18:07:41 <juhp> ?
18:14:12 <shapr> darcs pull -a
18:20:35 <dons> ok. fixed the default target. added an install target. fixed the readme
18:20:56 <dons> time to stop hacking the build system!
18:24:17 <shapr> and start building the hack system!
18:24:24 <dons> yeah!
18:28:14 * shapr hugs hs-plugins
18:29:20 <juhp> cabal is needed to build hemacs now?
18:30:14 <dons> no?
18:33:56 <shapr> what's the next step towards a usable editor? curses text editing widget?
18:34:22 <Igloo> What does it do so far? Are there screenshots or anything anywhere?
18:34:47 <shapr> So far it dynamically loads everything on a tiny static core.
18:35:35 <shapr> Not sure about anything else.
18:35:53 <dons> i think we have to clean out some of the riot-specific stuff now, and see if we can get a buffer displayed
18:36:21 <Igloo> What is everything, though?
18:36:38 <shapr> At this point, riot
18:36:40 <dons> the ui, event handler etc
18:37:36 * dons aliases gmake=make on linux
18:38:47 <shapr> love these messages "Starting up dynamic Haskell ... jumping over the edge ... done."
18:39:21 <juhp> (nm, seems depend is the default target now?)
18:39:39 <dons> default target should be: boot all /
18:40:00 <dons> recent patch just went in (5 mins ago)
18:40:20 <dons> shapr: I had to convince myself I was really getting into the dynamic code ;)
18:41:01 <juhp> dons: thx
18:41:05 <dons> reminds me of the NetBSD booter on the mac68k. "So I sez to him, the real way to do it is to ... "
18:41:19 * shapr grins
18:50:45 <rhw> What's a good Haskell editor for Win32 ?
18:51:32 <desrt> gvim
18:51:57 <rhw> Ew. I'm gonna try PFE.
18:52:26 <desrt> ew?
18:52:42 <rhw> I'd rather get emacs.
18:52:55 <rhw> Just a matter of taste, imo. That "ew" was a bit out of place :)
18:52:58 <desrt> are you sure you're not a fortran prorgammer?
18:53:11 * desrt taunts
18:53:27 <rhw> Nah, I'm actually a C++ programmer reading "The craft of functional programming".
18:53:44 <desrt> c++ is about as nice as fortran
18:53:56 <rhw> haha
18:54:10 <rhw> Aren't language wars delightful ? =)
18:54:51 <desrt> wolfgang once said "there's nothing you can do in perl that can't be done more efficiently in haskell and more elegantly in c++"
18:55:19 <rhw> O_o
18:55:50 <desrt> it's a joke :)
18:56:01 <rhw> The haskell part :p
18:56:02 <desrt> haskell isn't exactly known for its efficiency and c++ is far from elegant
18:56:17 <rhw> C++ can be elegant, in the right hands.
18:56:29 <desrt> and haskell efficient
18:56:36 <rhw> And I'm sure haskell can be efficient if used for the right tasks.
18:57:04 <desrt> ghc could be made a lot more intelligent
18:57:07 <desrt> but it's a lot of work
18:57:47 <rhw> I found it impossible to learn haskell in a decent amount of time without buying a book.
18:57:55 <rhw> That's a big minus for a low-spread language.
18:58:06 <desrt> haskell isn't difficult for people to learn
18:58:14 <desrt> haskell is difficult for imperative programmers to learn
18:58:26 <rhw> Most programmers are used to imperative languages.
18:58:56 <desrt> this is not haskell's fault
18:59:44 <rhw> I never said it was. But haskell could grow a lot if there was good online material for beginners.
18:59:54 <rhw> Especially for people coming from imperative programming languages.
19:00:27 <rhw> If there were more people learning haskell, some of them would help it grow (making ghc better, etc).
19:01:26 <desrt> hm
19:01:50 <desrt> i guess i don't really know
19:02:02 <desrt> i was fortunate enough to absorb haskell from those around me
19:02:16 <rhw> If I had enough time to spare, I would have done the same.
19:02:55 <desrt> learn vi while you're at it =)
19:03:34 <rhw> I used vi before moving to emacs. I can't remember why I switched, but right now, I'd rather stick with emacs.
19:03:53 <rhw> As I'd use it for haskell only anyway, because I do my C++ coding in VS.
19:05:21 <rhw> Anyway, I'd better go sleep. I can't turn on the lights becase my gf's sleeping - thus I cannot continue reading my book.
19:05:25 <rhw> Later =)
20:47:45 <dons> cool. we can run hemacs in ghci
21:17:18 <CLxyz> bah
21:17:21 <CLxyz> vi > emacs
21:21:47 <dons> forall a. Editor a => Hemacs > a
21:22:16 <mflux> so Hemacs > Hemacs? hmm
21:22:58 <dons> yep. it's quite tricky. maybe that's why it's hard to load in ghci
21:23:20 <CLxyz> am i the only one who thinks emacs is bloated?
21:23:30 <dons> motd
21:23:36 <heatsink> nup
21:36:44 <mflux> emacs is actually quite lean. it just comes with loads of stuff you can either load or not.
23:00:29 <xrockai> yeho :)
23:06:51 <mornfall> uhm, everyone asleep? =)
