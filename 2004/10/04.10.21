00:08:03 <viyyer> hi .. !  I am just try to start with hugs
00:08:28 <viyyer> how can I move ahed of prelude prompt?
00:11:57 <ayrnieu> putStrLn "Hello, world!"
00:12:13 <ayrnieu> exit -- OK, now I must read very tutorial documentation.  Sorry.
00:14:47 <viyyer> why don't commands like load and also , edit don't work
00:16:20 <ayrnieu> :load :edit
00:17:02 <viyyer> thanks ... I missed out on the  ":"
00:53:06 <musasabi> morning
01:02:58 <viyyer> hi what is the command to enable the editor.. ! I have exporteed the EDITOR=\usr\bin\mcedit
01:05:13 <viyyer> still :edit does not invoke the editor why ?
01:05:28 <earthy> viyyer: what OS?
01:05:54 <earthy> (you may want to try   EDITOR=/usr/bin/mcedit ... with / instead of \ )
01:09:15 <viyyer> sorry I have used / ! I'm working on linux
01:13:06 <earthy> hm.
01:14:29 <earthy> time to install ghc on my linux box at home...
01:14:31 <earthy> ;)
01:50:43 <musasabi> Is there any article on defining sub-categories of haskell objects and working with them?
02:06:18 <musasabi> Basically anything related to implementing subcategories
02:12:31 <juhp> morning!
02:12:41 <musasabi> morning juhp 
02:13:23 * juhp wonders if anyone has tried ghc with fedora core devel (rawhide) recently....
02:13:35 <juhp> seems to hang for me :-(
02:22:05 <vivek> Bonjour juhp 
02:22:28 <juhp> vivek: bonjour
02:46:43 <musasabi> btw did something come out of the plan to have a darcs ghc repository?
03:17:00 <viyyer> hi.. can anyone post a simple.. runnable.. test code.. !!( say it calculates a square and prints something like that)
03:21:18 <psi> square = (^2)
03:22:21 <viyyer> what is main ? what is the syntax for main.. !
03:24:12 <psi> where do you see main? you don't need a main function to test a function
03:25:28 <psi> i think a main function is useful when compiling a program, but I have never done that and it's not neccesary when learning the language
03:26:28 <tuomov> main = print whatever
03:27:58 <Iter> main = print . (^2) . read   (been a while since I wrote any haskell, but I think that's right)
03:28:43 <tuomov> main = read >>= liftM (^2) >>= print
03:30:23 <Iter> which is easier for a beginner to parse using do notation, but that would hide the semantics of what's actually happening.
03:30:50 <tuomov> actually, neither of those work.
03:30:58 <musasabi> What is the :+: constructor? (google refuces to accept it as a search term...)
03:31:52 <tuomov> main = readLn >>= print . (^2)
03:33:07 <tuomov> perhaps more readable with =<< readLn at the end
03:34:12 <viyyer> cool. .. it works.. I have somthing that works to start with .. ! 
03:35:31 <tuomov> hmm. is there a function that would do what I was trying to do with liftM above..
03:36:13 <tuomov> a -> b -> (a -> m b)
03:36:36 <tuomov> err. (a -> b) -> (a -> m b)
03:36:53 <Iter> tuomov: don't you mean (a -> b) -> (a -> m b) ?
03:36:55 <Iter> ahh yes.
03:37:24 <Iter> and yes I'm pretty sure I remember something like that in the prelude.
03:40:04 <tuomov> I can't seem to find one, and it would seem like a quite frequently wanted one
03:42:02 <bourbaki> moin
03:42:20 <tromp> g'morning
03:43:11 <bourbaki> *bows*
03:44:39 <shapr> dash: y0!
03:46:31 <tromp> You obliterated The lizardman chieftain completely with cave.
03:46:43 <shapr> cave?
03:46:46 <shapr> hoi tromp 
03:46:50 <bourbaki> moin shapr :)
03:46:58 <shapr> greetings bourbaki 
03:47:10 <tromp> i can rename my weapons:)
03:47:15 <shapr> oh
03:47:28 <tromp> it caves in skulls:)
03:47:32 <bourbaki> tromp: are you writeing a game?
03:47:56 <tromp> doing some mudding
03:48:03 <musasabi> @type (return .)
03:48:04 <lambdabot> (return .) :: forall m b a. (Monad m) => (a -> b) -> a -> m b
03:48:07 <shapr> w00, " Fix buffer insert,delete. Add write capability "
03:48:09 <musasabi> tuomov: there.
03:48:23 <shapr> dons: yayy!
03:48:26 <tuomov> yes it is easy to write such a function
03:48:35 <tuomov> but it would seem like a one to have a name for
03:48:38 <shapr> dash: Ashley Yakeley's HScheme is on sourceforge.
03:48:41 <tromp> has anyone written a mud in haskell?
03:50:16 * shapr doesn't know of one
03:50:42 <reltuk> that's one hell of a threaded state  :-p
03:51:05 <reltuk> I was thinking about writing a mud _client_ in haskell, but I got distracted
03:51:07 <shapr> greetings reltuk, how's code?
03:51:50 <reltuk> shapr: 'tis good, if highly procedural  (C++)
03:52:00 <shapr> good code is a great thing :-)
03:52:10 * reltuk whole-heartedly agrees
03:52:51 <shapr> occasionally I complain about writing Java, but then I remind myself that (Java > digging ditches)
03:53:14 <shapr> reltuk: what does your code do?
03:53:50 <tuomov> I don't know.. I'd occasionally like to go digging ditches
03:54:06 <tuomov> for a week or two once in a while
03:54:14 <tuomov> doing some real physical work
03:54:15 <reltuk> shapr: 2D parameterization of 3D meshes
03:54:35 <tuomov> knowing that you don't have to do it for the rest of your life, it could be fun
03:55:08 <shapr> If I had to choose somethin that I knew I'd do for the rest of my life, it would probably be programming.
03:55:47 <Iter> I've gone hauling irrigation pipes, and chasing cows on a dairy farm before.... makes an almost perfect break from coding.
03:55:58 <dons> tuomov: I worked as a tree surgeon for a few months. chainsaws and logs. glad I get to write code now
03:58:03 <shapr> I do think that I need a balance of working with both my body and my brain. That's why I unicycle :-)
03:58:28 <reltuk> hah, unicycling is awesome.  I just play the odd sport and jog
04:00:46 <Matt-W> you have to have something non-code to do
04:00:54 * Matt-W does Tai Chi and archery
04:01:30 <shapr> I like unicycling because it's like anti-programming. If you try to think about unicycling, you fall off.
04:01:30 <reltuk> heh, everything social
04:02:06 <tuomov> I don't really do anything..
04:02:28 <shapr> tuomov: Maybe you'd enjoy programming more if you did?
04:02:31 <JerubBaal> I spin.
04:02:41 <Iter> Apart from a weekly gym session, I fence.  The brain/body combo I find helpful.
04:02:53 <JerubBaal> ;)
04:03:29 <reltuk> JerubBaal: stay away from bill o'rielly
04:03:39 <JerubBaal> reltuk: ?
04:03:45 <tuomov> Every about two months, I start going for a long walk at least but got bored of it after a few days
04:04:10 <reltuk> JerubBaal: FOX News show host...calls his show the "no-spin zone"
04:04:22 <reltuk> walking is healthy
04:04:23 <JerubBaal> odd.
04:04:37 <JerubBaal> I heard that FOX news was the most decietful news service in the states?
04:05:10 <JerubBaal> reltuk: anyway, I spin fibre.
04:05:19 <reltuk> that might be going a bit far...it's known for it's conservative opinioned hosts though
04:05:31 <tuomov> You should see the documentary Outfoxed
04:06:21 <reltuk> heh, I'm not going to get political, but I will say outfoxed is a crap-shoot of a movie
04:07:23 <JerubBaal> ;)
04:10:27 <JerubBaal> hey shapr, have you played with graphviz before?
04:11:48 <Iter> reltuk: jerub and I are .au-ians, so fortunately don't have to deal with .us 'media' except for the occasional online article.
04:12:38 <reltuk> australia is great...I went there over summer (your summer...our winter)
04:13:20 <Iter> that would be last year?  We're just entering our summer atm ;)
04:13:56 <reltuk> yep, last year...had an absolute blast.
04:14:05 <Iter> although we've just had a week of sporadic downpours!!!! WOOOOT!   hopefully that will continue for another week or two.
04:14:24 <reltuk> hah, rain stinks.  where in australia you live?
04:14:29 <Iter> qld.
04:14:37 <Iter> Rain ROCKS!!!
04:14:52 <JerubBaal> reltuk: we're in drought at the moment. Rain is *brilliant*
04:15:13 <Iter> well drought and rampant bushfires, so yes rain is always welcome.
04:15:58 * Iter was starting to wonder if he might be called up to help with support for the firefighters (my boss would just *love* that/not.)
04:16:07 <reltuk> ouch, that's brute...south texas got droughts every now and then...rain was welcome.  it's been soggy and in the 40s here for the past two weekends or so...it's getting old  :-p
04:16:33 <Iter> 40s C? or F?  (assume C) so yes that get's old fast.
04:17:06 <reltuk> hah, F...we're just entering winter
04:17:22 <Iter> we get 37-43 @ 98-100% humidity for about 3-5 weeks Jan-Feb, so we know how that feels.
04:17:40 <Iter> ahh, well that's a different kettle of fish.
04:17:44 <reltuk> yeah, that's when I was there...it was hot
04:18:03 <bourbaki> hi TheHunter 
04:18:06 <Iter> mmm we prefer to describe it as bloody stinking hot ourselves ;)
04:18:09 <TheHunter> hi bourbaki 
04:18:19 <reltuk> hah!
04:19:01 <Iter> although the north coast gets it worse, so I suppose we are lucky  (we also get to miss out on the cyclones)
04:19:26 <Iter> really, apart from those few weeks you couldn't ask for a better climate than brissie.
04:19:32 <reltuk> lol, you make is sound like such an inviting place
04:20:32 <reltuk> I stoped in the brisbane airport...spent time in cairnes, melbourne, sydney
04:20:41 * Matt-W thinks
04:20:49 <Iter> well we wear t-shirts in the middle of winter, and have an extended mild spring/autumn, and aircon for about 1.5 months in the year.
04:20:50 <Matt-W> 40 F isn't cold!
04:20:58 <Iter> what's that in C?
04:21:04 * Iter runs up units.
04:21:42 <reltuk> Matt-W: no, but it's cold enough to be inconvieniant
04:22:05 <Iter> 22 degC.  We don't get that much colder than that mid-winter ;)
04:22:34 <Iter> (well not during the day anyway)
04:22:44 <Matt-W> Iter: no way is 22C 40F, that's more like 60
04:22:58 <reltuk> that's our fall...we'll be -10 F by winter
04:23:19 <reltuk> http://www.google.com/search?q=40+F+%3D+%3F+C&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
04:23:28 <reltuk> it's 4.4 C
04:23:44 <Matt-W> mild winter weather
04:23:47 <Matt-W> well
04:23:48 <Matt-W> mildish
04:24:05 <Iter> mmm wonder what happened to my calculation...
04:24:22 <reltuk> Matt-W : half getting there...nothing in comparison, but when it's rainy and you gotta walk a mile and a half to class, it pisses you off  :-p
04:25:07 <Matt-W> try cycling four miles to work in the pouring rain
04:25:15 <Matt-W> I always find that exciting
04:25:37 <Iter> coldest we get down to is -3 or so as a 4am min during the height of winter.
04:25:54 <bourbaki> TheHunter: have you had an idea yet?
04:27:13 <reltuk> Iter: heh, we get into the -20's C on crappy days...stupid winter
04:27:24 <waltz> I cycle about 1.5km :|
04:27:54 <TheHunter> well, the only thing i can think of is making your NNArrow an ST-Kleisli arrow.
04:27:55 <waltz> I really really want to get that motorcycle licence, but I'm too lazy.
04:28:27 <Iter> reltuk: of course we can probably beat you with rain density when it does decide to pour.  being sub-tropical we get mini-monsoon style, ~1m visibility rain :)
04:29:03 <waltz> Interesting
04:29:22 <TheHunter> bourbaki: your arrows would have to be created within a ST monad, as this is the only way (i can think of, except weird ghc extensions perhaps) you can safely define unique references to arrows.
04:29:35 <Iter> reltuk: you should winter in qld and enjoy +40 C ;)
04:30:13 * waltz enjoys winter
04:30:17 <TheHunter> bourbaki: something along the lines: data NNArrow s a b = NN { unNN :: a -> ST s b }
04:30:17 <reltuk> Iter: yeah, south texas was like that...I have no idea why I came up here :-p
04:30:29 <TheHunter> bourbaki: and type NNRef s a b = STRef s [NNArrow s a b]
04:30:29 <bourbaki> TheHunter: sounds reasonable but can i add arrows that way also?
04:31:37 <TheHunter> bourbaki: in this scenario, you can add and delete arrows only if you have an arrow reference at this position.
04:32:20 <TheHunter> bourbaki: but i guess you could also define an interface where you can reference arrows by nodes.
04:32:47 <bourbaki> yes thats what i thought but i think ill just switch to topology then to add new arrows
04:34:07 <TheHunter> how does the input of a NN look like? does it change completely at each step or are there just small changes to parts of the input?
04:35:16 <TheHunter> that is, has the complete net to be recomputed for a new input?
04:35:34 <bourbaki> yes the latter
04:36:50 <reltuk> I'm out...gotta wake up in 4 hours at noon to turn in an assignment
04:37:01 <TheHunter> bourbaki: ok, that is definitely the more difficult variant. You'll also have to think about what happenes to side-effects.
04:37:49 <bourbaki> TheHunter: the state monad you proposed is like a functor then isnt it?
04:40:33 <TheHunter> not really, it's used both to construct unique refernces when building up the network and to handle side effects of your net (adding/deleting arrows).
04:54:21 <Boegel> hello everybody 
04:54:25 <DenizzzZ> hi
05:01:57 <kosmikus> @seen dblhelix
05:01:57 <lambdabot> I haven't seen dblhelix
05:03:58 <viyyer> what is the biggest application that is done with haskell ?
05:05:59 <Boegel> viyyer: there are lot's op application written in haskell, that's not easy to say
05:06:18 <dons> ghc is quite big. 250,000 lines or so (inc. libraries), last time I checked.
05:06:32 <musasabi> Would changing the behaviour of lhs predicate types (class constraints) in data type definitions break a lot of code?
05:06:38 <Boegel> viyyer: , why do you want to know ?
05:07:02 <musasabi> e.g. data Eq k => Key k = Key k
05:07:03 <viyyer> well. I was preparing a report for the usage of languages... 
05:07:10 <dons> 229,345 code, 126,685 comments == ghc + libraries + hslibs
05:07:18 <TheHunter> musasabi: they don't have any effect now, have they?
05:07:25 <Boegel> and you want to look at the biggest application written in Haskell for that purpose ? :)
05:07:27 <dons> just ghc itself: 86337  64883
05:07:39 <musasabi> TheHunter: they carry the predicate around currently
05:07:42 <viyyer> yeah... !! 
05:08:06 <dons> first is lines of code, 2nd number is lines of comments.
05:08:32 <Igloo> Is a blank line counted as a comment?
05:08:39 <musasabi> but they don't really work.
05:08:39 <dons> not by spj's script
05:08:53 <Boegel> Igloo: probably not
05:08:56 <viyyer> hmm.. ! and.. what are the major project which use haskell.. I saw .. klots of them... 
05:09:09 <Igloo> That's a pretty even ratio then
05:09:12 <dons> ghc/compiler/count_lines
05:09:23 <dons> quite good, yes.
05:09:23 <viyyer> ok
05:09:23 <TheHunter> musasabi: i don't think they're supposed to do what everyone assumes.
05:09:39 <dons> $fptools: 389,773 207,510
05:09:43 <Boegel> viyyer: what other languages are you looking at ?
05:09:55 <viyyer> I was looking at python... 
05:10:08 <Boegel> viyyer: maybe shapr would like such a comparison for the future Haskell Monthly :)
05:10:08 <viyyer> perl... C 
05:10:41 <dons> there is also 50,000 lines of C code in the rts
05:10:52 <viyyer> sure.. !! actually.. this one's more of a oral presentation.. ! but.. I'll sure make a paper for reference
05:10:57 <musasabi> TheHunter: would changing them to really restrict things to a subset of objects be dispruptive/hard?
05:11:26 <TheHunter> musasabi: i don't think it would breake much code, but it still might be hard to implement.
05:12:24 <viyyer> most of the haskell applications are very niche applications.. !! why is it so.. 
05:12:47 <Boegel> viyyer: because Haskell rules ? :p
05:13:41 <viyyer> for example.. !! video processing.. audio processing.. !! text evaluation tools or something.. which requires.. lot's of effort.. 
05:14:00 <viyyer> haskell is the laziest language I've ever seem
05:14:13 <viyyer> ever seen
05:14:57 <Lemmih> Can a language be more lazy that others?
05:15:43 <TheHunter> musasabi: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2004-March/006001.html
05:18:11 <Boegel> viyyer: you forgot raytracers :p
05:18:22 <viyyer> really ? 
05:18:30 <Boegel> yeah, I'm working on it ;)
05:18:32 <Boegel> and there's VOP
05:18:38 <Boegel> google for it
05:19:50 <viyyer> Boegel:   sure
05:20:43 <musasabi> TheHunter: The problem I am thinking of is whether there lurks code like "data Eq k => Key k = Key k ; foo :: Key (Bool -> Bool); foo = undefined" which is currently legal, but would become illegal with "working" constraints.
05:24:08 <Boegel> viyyer: for info on my raytracer progress, check http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic
05:24:44 <TheHunter> i don't think there's much code of this kind lurking around, but even that wouldn't be a problem if you'd implement that via -fglasgow-exts or a seperate flag. It has probably been never implemented because it'd be to hard a change. In fact Hughes proposed such an extension 1999 (www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/restricted-datatypes.ps).
05:30:13 <viyyer> I have just started with haskell since yesterday.. it continues to amaze me.. !! 
05:30:21 <Boegel> :)
05:30:30 <Boegel> viyyer: have you looked at the image file ?
05:30:42 <TheHunter> oh, i like that statement: "We believe the correct solution here is to rivise the monomorphism restriction."
05:31:43 <viyyer> the question I ask is.. why don't more people.. know about such a thing like haskell.. !! why confuse people with C
05:32:19 <musasabi> TheHunter: thanks, that seems very interesting. *reading the paper*
05:32:35 <shapr> @yow !
05:32:36 <lambdabot> Am I elected yet?
05:33:06 <Boegel> viyyer: tell shapr, he'll love you :)
05:33:11 * shapr votes for lambdabot as president.
05:33:14 <shapr> wha?
05:33:31 <shapr> greetings viyyer, welcome to the world of purely functional code!
05:33:56 <Boegel> shapr: see what he said 5 minutes ago :)
05:34:14 <viyyer> thanks.. !!  I've just started.. but.. this few minutes of journey was pretty amazing
05:34:38 <shapr> Yes, and it continues to be amazing.
05:34:52 <Boegel> shapr: give him the tour ! GIVE HIM THE TOUR ! :p
05:35:01 <viyyer> shapr:  yeah it does
05:35:27 <shapr> Boegel: sounds like he doesn't need it (-:
05:36:02 <viyyer> which tour ?
05:36:14 <shapr> it's the #haskell tour!
05:36:40 <viyyer> what's that ?

05:39:46 <shapr> @listmodules
05:39:46 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","cmafihe","dict","dummy
05:39:46 <lambdabot> ,"dynamic","eval","hello","karma","quote","seen","state","system","topic
05:39:46 <lambdabot> ,"type"]
05:39:52 <shapr> @listcommands quote
05:39:52 <lambdabot> Module quote provides the following commands: ["fortune","yow","arr"]
05:39:57 <shapr> @arr
05:39:57 <lambdabot> Eat maggoty hardtack, ye unkempt, jenny frequentin', son of a gun.
05:40:02 <shapr> @yow
05:40:02 <lambdabot> I'm GLAD I remembered to XEROX all my UNDERSHIRTS!!
05:40:48 <Boegel> @fortune
05:40:49 <lambdabot> Most people's favorite way to end a game is by winning.
05:40:58 <Boegel> that's true, very true ;)
05:42:25 <viyyer> crazy cool
05:45:02 <viyyer> is there a need for OO extensions for haskell or procedural will rule the world ?
05:45:40 <Boegel> viyyer: there OO extensions
05:45:49 <kosmikus> procedural? functional!
05:45:54 <shapr> functional!
05:47:04 <phubuh> haskell has classes, and everything's an object!
05:47:11 <viyyer> sory.. functional.. !! 
05:47:16 * phubuh cheats at the OO game
05:47:27 <viyyer> really ? 
05:47:52 <phubuh> well, it has something *called* classes (type classes), and "everything's an object" is an obvious tautology :-)
05:54:17 <swiert> kosmikus: Ralf Laemel has been working on OOHaskell, if you're interested.
05:54:38 <shapr> and there's always HList for dessert ;-)
05:55:08 <Boegel> in hugs, how can I check how long it takes to execute a certain function ?
05:55:13 <Boegel> is there an option for that ?
05:56:02 <viyyer> BTW Boegel I was testing ur code on hugs.. was it tested on hugs? or GHC? 
05:57:06 <Boegel> hugs...
05:57:16 <Boegel> I know, something is wrong with it
05:57:20 <Boegel> I just tested it too...
05:57:28 <Boegel> I'll change it, give me a minute
05:57:33 <viyyer> k
05:57:42 <Boegel> hat's because I changed it without checking in hugs at school
05:58:12 <kosmikus> swiert: did I ask about it?
05:58:40 <swiert> kosmikus: you mentioned it a few minutes ago, I think.
05:58:57 <kosmikus> no, don't think so
05:59:15 <Boegel> and viyyer, it shouldn't matter whether it is tested in hugs or ghc... :)
05:59:23 <kosmikus> I know that he's working on it, and I'm not particularly interested ;)
05:59:34 <swiert> aha - I read an exclamation mark as a question.
05:59:49 <swiert> I didn't expect you to be.
05:59:53 <Boegel> viyyer: I uploaded the adjusted code...
06:00:02 <Boegel> try it again, and it should work
06:00:15 <TheHunter>  
06:00:23 <TheHunter> hmm, sorry
06:00:27 <shapr> TheHunter:     
06:00:38 <viyyer> righto Boegel 
06:01:06 <Boegel> viyyer: you're from india ?
06:01:38 <viyyer> yeah 
06:01:42 <Boegel> nice :o)
06:01:56 <Boegel> I hear they're a lot of computer people over there, is that right ?
06:03:05 <Boegel> ow, viyyer, you should run the 'main' function with 'main dir/file.ppm'
06:05:39 <Boegel> nobody knows about an option to check execution time for a function in HUGS ?
06:06:26 <viyyer> Boegel: how do I do that ?
06:07:00 <Lemmih> Boegel: Did you check ':?'?
06:07:32 <Boegel> viyyer: windows or linux ?
06:07:51 <viyyer> linux 
06:09:37 <Boegel> viyyer: in Hugs, do this:  main "~/test.ppm"
06:09:52 <Boegel> then you'll find a ppm file in your home directory which you can open with The Gimp
06:10:04 <Boegel> Lemmih: I can't find anything but printing dots for progress...
06:10:40 <shapr> neat, when did Aaron Denney show up on post-emacs?
06:10:57 * shapr checks the subscriber list
06:11:29 <CosmicRay> @index basename
06:11:30 <lambdabot> bzzt
06:11:34 <CosmicRay> bah
06:11:38 <CosmicRay> @index dirname
06:11:39 <lambdabot> bzzt
06:11:41 <CosmicRay> pfft
06:11:54 <shapr> ?
06:12:06 <CosmicRay> @index absname
06:12:06 <lambdabot> bzzt
06:12:08 <CosmicRay> grr
06:12:15 <CosmicRay> I'm trying to find these filename functions
06:12:18 <shapr> greetings Agent Goerzen
06:12:21 <CosmicRay> dirname gives you the directory component of a filename
06:12:34 <CosmicRay> good morning, Template Shapr.
06:12:43 <shapr> Template?
06:12:45 * shapr wonders
06:12:55 <CosmicRay> was just remembering the TH discussion we started yesterday :-)
06:12:59 <shapr> oh :-)
06:14:01 <CosmicRay> seriously though, do you know where those functions might be?
06:14:07 <shapr> um
06:14:15 <shapr> System.Directory?
06:14:22 <shapr> @index Directory
06:14:22 <lambdabot> System.Posix.Internals
06:14:29 <CosmicRay> nope, checked System.Directory already
06:14:31 <shapr> I dunno... I've seen Directory around somewhere.
06:14:54 <Lemmih> I don't think those functions are in the standard library.
06:15:03 <shapr> I think I've seen some code to do that, but I don't remember where.
06:15:04 <CosmicRay> pfft!
06:15:07 <dons> nope. couldn't grep them.
06:15:10 <CosmicRay> Lemmih: that sucks.
06:15:17 <dons> there's some in hs-plugins you could nick
06:15:32 <CosmicRay> oh?
06:15:36 <CosmicRay> C or Haskell code?
06:15:41 <Boegel> viyyer: is it working ? :)
06:15:51 <dons> Haskell
06:15:56 <dons> 1 liners
06:16:03 <CosmicRay> dons: sweet.  got a url?
06:16:03 * shapr tries to decide between unicycling and coding.
06:16:10 <CosmicRay> shapr: coding.
06:16:13 <dons> basename p = reverse $ takeWhile (/= '/') $ reverse p
06:16:17 <CosmicRay> shapr: unicycling benefits only the hospitals.
06:16:22 <desrt> shapr; code
06:16:24 <dons> dirname p  = case reverse $ dropWhile (/= '/') $ reverse p of
06:16:24 <dons>         [] -> "."
06:16:24 <shapr> :-P
06:16:24 <dons>         p' -> p'
06:16:38 <shapr> desrt: oh hey, JP seems fine with me doing whatever on haskell.org, so...
06:16:47 <viyyer> Boegel: it gives an error Program error: ~/test.ppm: Prelude.writeFile: does not exist (file does not exist)
06:16:49 <desrt> shapr; root it is, then :)
06:17:03 <shapr> I got a strong feeling he was like "and it hurt none, go away and leave me alone"
06:17:04 <CosmicRay> dons: sweet.  where did you get that from?
06:17:05 <phubuh> flip a unicycling shapr and if you hurt your head, code, and if you land on your wheel, keep it up
06:17:13 <desrt> heh.
06:17:14 <shapr> haha
06:17:24 <desrt> so account or forward?
06:17:26 <dons> CosmicRay: src/plugins/Plugins/Utils.hs
06:17:34 <shapr> desrt: which do you want?
06:17:43 <desrt> i don't really need an account
06:17:52 <shapr> ok, I'll make you a forward
06:17:57 <shapr> to the address you requested.
06:18:03 <desrt> leet
06:18:03 <dons> CosmicRay: in plugins src at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/
06:18:13 <CosmicRay> got it.  thanks much.
06:18:27 <desrt> what's on that box anyway?  just email and web?
06:18:37 <shapr> I think so.
06:18:41 <shapr> wikis too
06:18:43 <desrt> does it have some exotic process arch?
06:18:47 <desrt> *processor
06:18:49 <shapr> huh?
06:18:59 <shapr> nah, i696
06:19:02 <shapr> um i686
06:19:05 <desrt> heh
06:19:06 * viyyer why is it unable to create a file 
06:19:11 <desrt> 696 is pretty exotic yet :)
06:19:17 <desrt> not too much mainstream take-up there
06:19:20 <shapr> 2.4.21 even
06:19:28 <desrt> wow.  pretty boring
06:19:30 <Boegel> viyyer: strange, I don't have the problem here
06:19:32 <shapr> yup
06:19:44 <shapr> too bad it's not debian, I'd have a field day upgrading it.
06:19:53 <desrt> what is it?
06:19:56 <Boegel> hey, don't go running :s
06:20:11 <shapr> redhat, I think
06:20:23 <desrt> it's sort of funny how you can be unsure :)
06:20:27 <shapr> "Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 3 (Taroon Update 3)"
06:20:35 <shapr> what do you mean?
06:20:53 <desrt> i mean i log in to servers all the time and do considerable stuff on them
06:21:03 <desrt> and then i'm like "hmm.. i wonder if this is freebsd or linux or what?"
06:21:09 <shapr> desrt: I have root on a bunch of different boxes around the world, I get paid to take care of them.
06:21:13 <shapr> oh yeah, same thing for you :-)
06:21:44 <shapr> actually, I think I'm going to hack my zsh prompt to tell me what I'm using.
06:21:53 <desrt> don't worry.  i wasn't dissin :P
06:21:56 <CosmicRay> dons: do you want copyright attribution if I steal those two functions for my own library?
06:22:10 <Boegel> dons: say yes :p
06:22:14 <CosmicRay> I'm happy to do it, just figured I'd check before adding a longer license than the code :-)
06:22:49 <shapr> stupid system that requires more license than code...
06:22:50 <desrt> once you get a certain level of gnu installed, all OSes are the same :)
06:22:58 <shapr> desrt: true that
06:23:05 <shapr> well, except AIX
06:23:05 <CosmicRay> shapr: just about every license is longer than that code :-)
06:23:10 <CosmicRay> bwahaha
06:23:17 <CosmicRay> yes, AIX is always.... different.
06:23:37 * desrt has shells on 5 AIX boxen but doesn't know their hostnames
06:23:40 <shapr> nah, I mean that, if you have to put the license in every file of Haskell source code, you often end up with more license than code.
06:23:41 <dons> CosmicRay: steal them! I'll be sure to steal something of yours in return ;)
06:23:45 <vivek> hello room
06:23:45 <CosmicRay> dons: ok :-)
06:23:55 <shapr> vivek: room isn't here right now ;-)
06:24:07 <CosmicRay> shapr: I'm not even talking the entire GPL, just the little "include by reference" blurb :-)
06:24:13 <shapr> ok, fair enough...
06:24:16 <CosmicRay> here's a fun example of aix.
06:24:24 <CosmicRay> on most systems, uname -a will tell you your processor.
06:24:34 <CosmicRay> on AIX4, it's /etc/lsattr -EHl proc0
06:24:39 <shapr> yick
06:24:54 <desrt> i can think of about 27 reasons that that's just wrong
06:24:55 <shapr> man I remember how long it took me to find the hinv command on Irix
06:24:56 <CosmicRay> on AIX5, it's /usr/somecrapIforget/bin/lsattr -EHl proc0
06:25:04 <CosmicRay> oh, and top is named topas.
06:25:09 <shapr> weirdness
06:25:09 <desrt> and 24 of them are something along the lines of "binaries in /etc?!?"
06:25:18 <CosmicRay> heh
06:25:23 <vivek> /etc/lsattr -EH1 proc0
06:25:40 <CosmicRay> s/1/l/
06:25:46 <shapr> vivek: you're an AIX user?
06:26:15 <vivek> no i was just kinda hoping to remember it the next time i need it haha
06:26:23 <shapr> :-)
06:26:25 <desrt> ok.. there's some math dude named catheodory or something
06:26:29 <desrt> i need to know how to spell that :)
06:26:31 <vivek> the best way to rememebr a command is to use it 
06:26:34 <CosmicRay> vivek: I learned that command from the nhc98 source, btw
06:26:50 <CosmicRay> oh, also, to find out the version of AIX, the command os oslevel.
06:26:54 <CosmicRay> uname also doesn't tell you that.
06:27:09 <CosmicRay> err, "the command is oslevel"
06:27:15 <shapr> desrt: ask Cale?
06:27:25 <desrt> :)
06:27:37 <desrt> it's the name of one of the aix boxes...
06:28:40 <vivek> desrt: ask google hehe
06:28:53 <vivek> u get correced for ur bad spellings 
06:29:12 <CosmicRay> and sometimes, you get corrected for your correct spellings
06:29:14 <CosmicRay> which ticks me off
06:30:19 <desrt> 191.68.113.130.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer caratheodory.cas.McMaster.CA
06:30:22 <desrt> a hah!
06:30:30 <desrt> vivek; i wasn't close enough for google to help :)
06:30:53 <desrt> AIX caratheodory 1 5 000DC32F4C00
06:30:57 <desrt> uh
06:31:18 <desrt> my lsattr is in /usr/sbin.  that's nice
06:31:30 <CosmicRay> desrt: hmm.
06:32:07 <desrt> and it takes -E and -H but not 1
06:32:22 <CosmicRay> that's a lowercase L, not a 1
06:32:32 <desrt> oh :)
06:32:39 <desrt> there we go
06:32:48 <desrt> 09:25 <vivek> /etc/lsattr -EH1 proc0
06:32:49 <desrt> 09:25 <CosmicRay> s/1/l/
06:33:00 <desrt> saw the first line and missed the correction =)
06:33:02 <CosmicRay> huh, it's in /usr/sbin on our 5.1L box too
06:33:23 <shapr> um, I just have to run postmap to go from aliases to aliases.db, right?
06:33:25 <desrt> PowerPC_POWER3 at 375MHz
06:33:29 <CosmicRay> I thought it was in /usr/lpp
06:33:33 <desrt> shapr; newaliases
06:33:36 <desrt> usually...
06:33:37 <shapr> ah, thanks
06:33:42 <CosmicRay> # lsattr -EHl proc0
06:33:42 <CosmicRay> attribute value          description     user_settable
06:33:42 <CosmicRay> state     enable         Processor state False
06:33:42 <CosmicRay> type      PowerPC_POWER4 Processor type  False
06:33:42 <CosmicRay> frequency 1453000000     Processor Speed False
06:33:49 <desrt> you have a POWER4?
06:33:51 <desrt> can i have a shell?
06:33:58 <CosmicRay> uhm, yes, and no, in that order :-)
06:33:59 <shapr> ok, let's hope I did that right.
06:34:05 * shapr mails desrt@haskell.org
06:34:05 <desrt> :(
06:34:22 <CosmicRay> desrt: it's really sad to want an AIX shell.
06:34:23 <CosmicRay> :-)
06:34:34 * CosmicRay feels for desrt.  he must be desperate.
06:34:35 <desrt> CosmicRay; i'm working on a project that's making a compiler to target G5s
06:34:37 <shapr> haha
06:34:42 * shapr laughs evilly
06:34:46 <desrt> G5 is based on POWER4
06:34:55 <CosmicRay> desrt: you might check out gcc
06:34:58 <desrt> we want it for testing
06:35:08 <shapr> desrt: y0, you got that email?
06:35:19 <desrt> shapr; not yet
06:35:40 <CosmicRay> desrt: I dunno, for a $70k box, it's sad that sometimes -- actually, often -- my $1.5k amd64 workstation can outperform it.
06:35:57 <CosmicRay> it does run databases really well
06:36:20 <CosmicRay> tar -zxvf is at least 10 times slower though
06:36:29 <shapr> "User unknown in local recipient table" doh
06:36:50 <desrt> you can give me an account too
06:37:04 <dons> 70k. that is astonishing. and it runs ghc :)
06:37:10 <CosmicRay> :-)
06:37:20 <CosmicRay> hey, it's less than our last system.  a $120k AS/400
06:37:31 <desrt> do these big boxes seriously go for $70k?
06:37:35 <CosmicRay> yes
06:37:38 <desrt> wow.
06:37:44 <desrt> all they do is sit there and run CDE.  badly.
06:37:48 <CosmicRay> heh
06:37:55 <CosmicRay> this thing has lots of disks
06:37:58 <desrt> it's like you're paying big bucks to have your eyes offended by motif
06:37:59 <CosmicRay> more than a dozen, I think
06:38:05 <CosmicRay> nobody uses the console
06:38:11 <CosmicRay> hell, the keyboard isn't even plugged in right now
06:38:15 <desrt> oh dude... if you drop it down into console mode
06:38:16 <CosmicRay> it's an ERP server
06:38:19 <desrt> it's all green-on-black
06:38:26 <CosmicRay> yeah I've seen the boot sequence
06:38:30 <shapr> I miss green-on-black somedays.
06:38:30 <CosmicRay> which btw takes about 30 minutes
06:38:36 <desrt> it's something out of war games... we're going to teach it how to play "global thermonuclear war" :)
06:38:41 <shapr> then I just do M-x color-theme retro-green
06:38:45 <CosmicRay> it's a little freaky to see green-on-black on a flatpannel LCD
06:38:47 <CosmicRay> heh
06:41:05 <shapr> which is spiffier? adduser or useradd?
06:41:52 <desrt> i think they're the same
06:42:01 <desrt> adduser, if it's different, will do more
06:42:14 <earthy> depends on the spiffiness you want
06:42:38 <desrt> oh wait.  useradd does more
06:42:47 <earthy> if you want spiffy UI, go for adduser
06:42:53 <earthy> if you want power, go for useradd
06:43:12 <desrt> the joke is on gentoo 'adduser' is a symlink to useradd :)
06:43:25 <dons> unboxed Haskell is the best language for writing in C
06:43:36 <dons> ;)
06:43:54 * desrt reads dr. kahl's email again
06:45:03 <desrt> he sent me BNF for a language he wants me to write a compiler for instead of C
06:45:22 <shapr> and you stuffed that BNF into BNFC and sent him a reply?
06:45:37 <desrt> nah.  i'm still parsing it
06:45:43 <desrt> it looks like a beast of a language
06:45:49 <shapr> c'mon man, get it moving!
06:45:59 <desrt> heh.
06:46:10 <earthy> transform the BNF to SDF, put the SDF into an SGLR parsergenerator, presto
06:46:24 <shapr> desrt: check your mail
06:46:34 <desrt> wtf.  i just opened up my underwear drawer and there was a network card in it
06:46:44 <earthy> TMI
06:46:44 <shapr> desrt: you're a sick sick puppy
06:46:50 <shapr> earthy: exactly =)
06:47:58 <earthy> I won't be borrowing any hardware of desrt anytime in the future, that's for sure ;)
06:47:58 <desrt> no mail.
06:47:58 <desrt> earthy; it's all cool.  it was in with the socks
06:49:32 * shapr puts this on the QuotesPage on the wiki
06:50:13 <desrt> ah.  as it turns out, i was just blackholing all mail from people named shae
06:50:27 <desrt> it's good now :)
06:50:56 <shapr> :-P
06:51:06 * shapr smacks desrt with a trout
06:51:30 * desrt exploits a whole in mirc and/or windows and/or internet explorer and takes shapr down for the count
06:51:34 <shapr> dash: WAKE UP!
06:52:31 <shapr> desrt: ok, anything else?
06:54:48 <desrt> shapr; no.  this is all, thank you :)
06:54:59 <shapr> ok, bug me if you need anything else.
06:55:07 <desrt> shapr; hey?
06:55:11 <shapr> yes?
06:55:17 <desrt> can you get me a hot chocolate please?
06:55:26 <shapr> no
06:55:35 <desrt> o
06:55:36 <desrt> ok
06:55:42 <desrt> :)
06:55:48 <CosmicRay> a cold beer maybe?
06:55:50 <thebug> somebody called thebug?
06:56:02 <shapr> desrt: but you owe me a beer next time we meet at a functional programming conference, yah?
06:56:16 <desrt> shapr; i agree
06:56:21 <Cale> desrt: It's Carath√©odory
06:56:23 <desrt> but it's likely you'll never see the beer
06:56:24 <shapr> :-)
06:56:29 * shapr shrugs
06:56:36 <shapr> desrt: I'll come visit you...
06:56:45 <desrt> that being said... who knows.  i may geek out and go all functional
06:56:57 <shapr> desrt: I think it's likely, actually.
06:57:03 <desrt> peer pressure alone is almost enough at this point
06:57:17 <desrt> being in the same building as wolfram and wolfgang on a daily basis is brutal
06:57:23 <shapr> desrt: oh not that at all, you seem driven to understand that which is opaque.
06:58:10 <Boegel> how can I put an 'if ... else' expression in a where clause ?
06:58:22 <desrt> shapr; thanks, i think :)
06:58:28 * shapr grins
06:58:36 <Boegel> can I use the | (x > 0) = ..... | otherwise = ... notation ?
06:58:50 <lyp|work> hey all
06:58:51 <desrt> Boegel; ya
06:58:53 <Lemmih> Boegel: Yes.
06:59:10 <lyp|work> i just installed a package (hsplugins) into a custom directory (subdir in homedir)
06:59:11 <Boegel> are there other ways to express a 'if..else' expression ?
06:59:15 <desrt> x z = y z where y z|(z>0) blah blah
06:59:20 <desrt> Boegel; there is case
06:59:26 <lyp|work> however, i'm unsure how i can get this package seen by the program i'm not installing?
06:59:28 <desrt> which supports pattern matching
06:59:41 <shapr> lyp|work: oh let's talk here...
06:59:44 <lyp|work> :P
07:00:00 <lyp|work> shapr: wasn't sure if you were busy or not :)
07:00:09 <shapr> I might be..
07:00:12 <shapr> I'm not sure either.
07:00:19 <desrt> like for example you could do map...
07:00:24 <desrt> map f x = case x of
07:00:27 <desrt>        [] -> []
07:00:33 <lyp|work> shapr: hehe
07:00:37 <desrt>       (x:xs) f x : map f xs
07:00:48 <desrt> except you'd want another space and a -> after (x:xs) :)
07:02:02 <desrt> shapr; you have some messed up shit on your website
07:02:36 <shapr> er, what?
07:02:42 <desrt> SkinHack.GIF
07:02:46 <shapr> oh, heh
07:02:56 <shapr> that's actually a famous smalltalk magazine cover picture
07:03:08 <shapr> long story behind that picture
07:03:12 <shapr> it's a bit of computing history
07:03:16 <dash> shapr: Hello!
07:03:21 <desrt> who are the dudes
07:03:23 <lyp|work> shapr: you have any ideas?
07:03:23 <shapr> dash: y0 y0
07:03:29 <dash> I think i looked at hscheme once 
07:03:34 <shapr> lyp|work: I have lots of ideas, but none of them seem to pan out right now
07:03:48 <lyp|work> shapr: i mean wrt the package thing :P
07:03:51 <shapr> lyp|work: I am almost positive you can get a local package.conf to work along with your actual installed package.conf
07:03:56 <lyp|work> hehe
07:03:59 <shapr> lyp|work: but I cannot remember how to do it.
07:04:01 * dash looks at it again
07:04:09 <shapr> dash: y0, seen yi?
07:04:18 <dash> ?
07:04:31 <desrt> shapr; do you use ratpoison?
07:04:33 <shapr> Haskell is now as dynamically reloadable as elisp...
07:04:39 <lyp|work> ghc --make MyProg.hs -package-conf ~/gtk2hs/localpackage.conf -package mogul
07:04:40 <lyp|work> found it
07:04:41 <shapr> desrt: nah, I use Ion!!
07:04:48 <Lunar^> shapr: Hey, Thomas released House sources ! :)
07:04:51 <shapr> lyp|work: thanks, I'll write that into my notes :-)
07:04:58 <shapr> Lunar^: YAY! are they on his website?
07:05:33 * shapr checks
07:05:51 <shapr> dash: darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi
07:06:10 <shapr> dash: we have a buffer, and we can edit and save and stuff.. now the fun part begins...
07:06:21 <dash> what's that do
07:06:21 <shapr> dash: remember my dreams of parse tree macros in an editor?
07:06:29 <dash> no
07:06:40 <Lunar^> shapr: yes ! :)
07:06:57 <shapr> Lunar^: cool, I'll grab sources and post a comment on lambda-the-ultimate.org
07:07:03 <lyp|work> shapr: one prob tho. can't find the package.conf :P
07:07:18 <dash> mmm, that reminds me, need to hit this elisp compiler some more
07:07:34 <shapr> dash: mailing list traffic so far - http://news.gmane.org/gmane.editors.post-emacs/
07:08:11 <shapr> lyp|work: it gets generated from the makefile, see how 'make register' dose 'env LIB=$DIR < plugins.conf.in' among others?
07:08:17 <dash> i'll post once it at least handles 'let' and addition. :)
07:08:39 <Lunar^> shapr: I'm so excited :)
07:08:54 <shapr> Lunar^: me too :-) hey how and where did you meet asyd?
07:09:17 <Lunar^> shapr: Last week, in Paris
07:09:28 <shapr> Did you already know him?
07:09:40 <Lunar^> shapr: anargeek activities
07:09:47 <shapr> ah, ok
07:10:30 <Lunar^> shapr: Why ?
07:10:33 * dash looks at hscheme sources and feels his eyes glaze over
07:10:46 <shapr> dash: c'mon, what're a few arrows among friends?
07:10:56 <shapr> Lunar^: I've known asyd for .. years? from #emacs
07:11:00 <dash> mmkay! i think i've had my haskell dose for now
07:11:08 <dash> i'll probably have to come do this again in 6 months
07:11:22 <shapr> dash: you should really drop by and inhale the language, it's good stuff.
07:11:32 <dash> shapr: i've tried
07:11:42 <shapr> I can help you out.
07:11:52 <Lunar^> shapr: uhh ok :)
07:11:53 <shapr> Special discounts for efnet#python veterans.
07:12:04 <dash> shapr: it's too different from the stuff i know to make it easy, and the benefits are too vague to make it interesting :)
07:12:09 <dash> i was never on efnet #python
07:12:30 <shapr> dash: are you sure?
07:12:40 <dash> well
07:12:46 <dash> only when fooling with the relay
07:13:15 <dash> i didn't join til 1999, really
07:13:21 <lyp|work> ugh
07:13:24 <lyp|work> far too much work
07:13:27 <shapr> I don't remember when I joined.
07:13:33 * lyp|work larts hsplugins and the entire package.conf scheme
07:13:36 <shapr> lyp|work: sorry, we'll try to make it easier.
07:13:45 <shapr> lyp|work: please try again in a few days =)
07:14:06 <lyp|work> shapr: i had to modify hsplugins to do "-f blah"
07:14:10 <Jan_w> hoi shammah
07:14:12 <shapr> dash: anyway, if you hang out and ask questions, I can hook you, really :-)
07:14:17 <shapr> hoi Jan_w 
07:14:18 <Jan_w> hoi shapr
07:14:20 <lyp|work> shapr: but now i'm getting a failure on openBinaryFile in ghc itself
07:14:24 <lyp|work> shapr: awful error message
07:14:39 <shapr> lyp|work: hm, that shouldn't happen
07:14:42 <dash> anyhow, i was just reminded of once wanting to implement a lisp's denotational semantics in haskell because i thought it might make things clearer
07:14:43 <shapr> what file is it complaining about?
07:14:46 <dash> http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi
07:14:50 <dash> errrg
07:14:52 <dash> wrong button
07:15:12 <shapr> desrt: tried ion?
07:15:25 <dash> but seeing things like "exprLetMap :: (LambdaExpression sym val f) => ((val -> r1) -> a -> r2) -> sym -> f a -> f r1 -> f r2" leads me to believe it will not be clearer
07:15:36 <lyp|work> LOL
07:15:37 <lyp|work> open("ig", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOCTTY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
07:15:52 <shapr> dash: that's only because you're reading Ashley Yakeley's code...
07:15:56 <lyp|work> AHAHAHAHA
07:15:57 <shapr> that boy is something else.
07:15:59 <lyp|work> -package-config
07:16:01 <lyp|work> HAHA
07:16:06 * shapr laughs
07:16:21 <shapr> lyp|work: that's good, best one I've seen in awhile.
07:16:26 <dash> shapr: well yeah i don't think this is as clear as it gets :)
07:16:29 <lyp|work> shapr: :P
07:16:46 <shapr> Guten Tag pesco.
07:17:00 <pesco> Hi shapr!
07:17:09 <shapr> dash: Ashley was unhappy with the standard classes in Haskell, so he reimplemented the entire hierarchy.
07:17:15 <lyp|work> lol
07:17:16 <dash> shapr: I.... see.
07:17:24 <pesco> What's going on on #haskell?
07:17:24 <dash> well
07:17:29 <shapr> dash: including all the monads, all the standard classes, all the arrow classes, and everything
07:17:44 <dash> once i get LiSP from the library again and get reacquainted with denotational semantics i may come back
07:18:02 <shapr> dash: he claims his implementation centers more on pure category theory than the standard... I have no clue if that's true :-)
07:18:09 <pesco> shapr: Ashley did what? Are you kidding? Where's his code?
07:18:22 <shapr> pesco: HScheme, HBase, lots of stuff.
07:18:22 <lyp|work> k
07:18:26 <dash> shapr: That would be reason enough for me to avoid it 
07:18:28 <lyp|work> shapr: i also did GHC=            ghc -package-conf /home/alex/install/yi/package.conf
07:18:30 <Lunar^> shapr: The PS2 Mouse driver is amazing
07:18:34 <lyp|work> shapr: in the config.mk
07:18:35 <shapr> Also, he hates whitespace and uses only curly braces and semicolons.
07:18:45 <pesco> Ah, right. I remember that. ;-)
07:18:46 <Lunar^> shapr: It's 45 kernel/Kernel/Driver/Mouse.hs
07:18:47 <dash> anyway i've got some fragmentary notes on doing some of this in haskell (mostly the beginnings of a Parsec parser)
07:18:49 <shapr> dash: well, *I* can't read his code without half a bottle of vodka first.
07:18:51 <dash> i'll be back :)
07:19:05 <shapr> dash: ok, I look forward to it.
07:19:07 <lyp|work> shapr: i'd love to read some of this stuff :P
07:19:20 <dash> but for now, it's time to go wrestle with SIP again!
07:19:24 <shapr> lyp|work: I'm still not convinced...
07:19:41 <lyp|work> shapr: i was once told by the author himself that i must be completely insane for being able to read it never mind extend it :P
07:19:44 <shapr> pesco: did you read HScheme and HBase? are they sane or not?
07:19:54 <dash> do you guys have an asynchronous networking framework with multiple protocols included yet? =)
07:19:58 <pesco> shapr: No, I haven't.
07:20:15 <shapr> dash: no, not yet.. but I have some nutty ideas...
07:20:18 <dash> PYTHON WINS
07:20:21 <CosmicRay> dash: it's my understanding that forkIO provides makes any network code in haskell synchronous or asynchronous
07:20:23 <CosmicRay> pfft
07:20:26 <shapr> ?
07:20:37 <shapr> that's not very nice.
07:20:46 <CosmicRay> he's a Twisted developer
07:20:51 <shapr> I was too for awhile.
07:21:00 <lyp|work> python sucks anyway
07:21:05 <CosmicRay> I'm working on the client stuff
07:21:07 <shapr> doesn't mean I go around being a fanatic...
07:21:07 <CosmicRay> starting with FTP
07:21:12 <desrt> shapr; no.  just rat poison very briefly
07:21:24 <desrt> and i'm a hardcore gnomer at heart so it's very unlikely that i'll stop using metacity
07:21:30 <shapr> desrt: ratpoison was too minimal for me, ion is an excellent balance, imho.
07:21:38 <lyp|work> desrt: i'm a kde devel using gnome atm :P
07:21:40 <phubuh> ratpoison is excellent for my needs :-)
07:21:48 <desrt> lyp|work; we have another guy like you :)
07:21:51 <Boegel> @type foldl
07:21:53 <lambdabot> foldl :: forall a b. (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
07:21:59 <Lunar^> waow, raw assembler in Haskell [Word8]
07:22:02 <shapr> I started with enlightenment =) 0.13 I think
07:22:18 <lyp|work> i started with fvwm then moved to enlightenment
07:22:32 <rhw> ion ?
07:22:33 <desrt> lyp|work; know clee?
07:22:39 <lyp|work> desrt: yup :)
07:22:41 <phubuh> the first thing i remember about linux is being fascinated with enlightenment's useless water effects
07:22:47 <desrt> he's a kde guy gone gnomer too :P
07:22:50 <lyp|work> desrt: damn ubuntu :P
07:22:58 <shapr> rhw: http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion/
07:22:59 <desrt> hahah
07:23:04 <Lunar^> shapr: They used a lot of C code, it seems
07:23:06 <desrt> i have an interesting take on ubuntu
07:23:20 <shapr> ubuntu seems nifty
07:23:23 <desrt> i think it's artificially hyped by those who hate gentoo
07:23:27 <shapr> I like Mark Shuttleworth.
07:23:34 <rhw> shapr, That's what you use ?
07:23:35 <lyp|work> desrt: i'm an ex gentoo'er
07:23:39 <shapr> rhw: yes, I use ion.
07:23:41 <desrt> but i have absolutely no supporting evidence
07:23:41 <lyp|work> desrt: as are *many* :)
07:23:58 <lyp|work> gentoo stopped any real development
07:24:07 <desrt> ya.  i've noticed that.
07:24:14 <lyp|work> ebuilds from > 4 months old still not accepted
07:24:22 <lyp|work> when i first joined it took a few days :/
07:24:23 <desrt> portage is still just as broken as it was a year ago
07:24:23 <shapr> desrt: I only had a tiny bit of interaction with Mark Shuttleworth at europython 2004, but he sure seems to have his heart in the right place.
07:24:27 <lyp|work> desrt: yeah :(
07:24:35 <desrt> shapr; he's the ubuntu guy?
07:24:47 <phubuh> whenever i start using ion, i start splitting my frames in sophisticated configurations, 'cause it's so easy, and then i get sick of it and move back to ratpoison with one frame per monitor, the only organization being a tendency to keep emacsen on certain numbers, a browser on a certain number, and so on
07:25:04 <phubuh> that's entirely my fault though :-)
07:25:31 <shapr> desrt: yes
07:25:37 <lyp|work> shapr: quick tutorial on how the hell i'm meant to use this editor? :P
07:25:41 <rhw> shapr, I suppose the stable Ion2 is what I should get to try it out ?
07:25:53 <desrt> my friends would kick my ass if i stopped using gentoo :(
07:25:57 <shapr> rhw: I'm using ion3, it's pretty cool. I've heavily modified my bindings though.
07:26:04 <lyp|work> desrt: swwwiiittcchhh
07:26:09 <lyp|work> desrt: ubuntu is nice :)
07:26:13 <pesco> desrt: Wow, I'm submitting that as a quote!
07:26:20 <lyp|work> pesco: lol
07:26:29 <shapr> lyp|work: well, it's not quite as usable as vim yet ;-)
07:26:37 <lyp|work> shapr: u should try ruvi some time :)
07:26:38 <shapr> lyp|work: but it's not bad for being six days old
07:26:50 <lyp|work> shapr: 4 kloc up to now
07:27:06 <desrt> shapr; wolfgang wants to talk to you to make sure you're not screwing up the editor backend :)
07:27:12 <lyp|work> hehe
07:27:23 <shapr> desrt: you know the answer, tell wolfgang to throw down some code.
07:27:27 <desrt> he has all these features he likes from macintosh editors :)
07:27:57 <shapr> I think thaller would fit right in...
07:28:04 <desrt> -fThaller
07:28:10 <desrt> that was quote-worthy too :)
07:28:10 * shapr grins
07:28:16 <shapr> thanks :-)
07:29:32 * shapr reads House
07:29:42 * desrt hugs moonpix
07:30:13 <desrt> where is this so-called quotes wiki anyway?
07:31:21 <pesco> desrt: Should I quote you anonymously? ;-)
07:31:36 <desrt> hm?
07:32:37 <pesco> Just kidding. :)
07:34:24 <shapr> desrt: http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/QuotesPage
07:34:29 <desrt> ya.  just found it
07:34:32 <desrt> i'm adding -fThaller :P
07:34:51 <lyp|work> ok. me gtg work
07:36:35 <shapr> My favorite is still the CowGirl part about "what are the two most common recursive errors?"
07:37:08 <desrt> hah.
07:37:16 * desrt can only think of 1, really
07:38:50 <shapr> lots of goodies on the QuotesPage
07:39:13 <desrt> <ejt> I guess it's time I leant how to interface to foriegn code, any pointers ?
07:39:18 <desrt> no way that was accidental :P
07:39:54 <shapr> it was actually :-)
07:40:06 <shapr> we all laughed and he said "what did I say???""
07:42:02 <shapr> A multi-day, multi-post discussion of how to structure something on a wiki really flips me out.
07:42:52 <shapr> Culturally speaking, I'm used to a wiki process of 1) do it 2) expect others to refine it
07:44:38 <shapr> Lunar^: oh, grub loads zipped images =)
07:44:58 <shapr> grub loads from the network!
07:48:13 <shapr> Lunar^: ack, gadgets is for licensed for academic use only :-(
07:49:07 <shapr> truly, that is a lot of C code.
07:49:22 <shapr> dons: you think more of the C in GHC could be Haskell?
07:52:59 <Lunar^> shapr: recently, Marlow changed implementation of blocked read/write from C to more Haskell in threaded RTS
07:53:09 <shapr> yay
07:53:30 <Lunar^> So it might be possible to remove a lot more C code and translate the rest to C-
07:53:33 <Lunar^> -
07:53:53 <Lunar^> but, I was wondering if it could be possible to write GHcc, by translating C to C--
07:54:57 <Lunar^> That doesn't seem that hard
07:57:01 <shapr> ?
07:57:38 <shapr> I wish gadgets had a real license :-(
07:58:50 <shapr> mmm "If we had Template Haskell inside hOp, we could do this :"
08:01:48 <shapr> hej bringert 
08:02:48 <Boegel> hello bringert
08:06:12 <Philippa> shapr: TH inside hOp would be very, very scary indeed
08:06:28 <shapr> that and hs-plugins would kick ass
08:06:29 <Philippa> especially if eg each platform had a type for the local machine code associated with it
08:07:24 <Lunar^> It is possible
08:07:30 <Lunar^> But we need to have a stage 2 compiler
08:07:36 <shapr> hey, I know you could dynamically load TH structures in the TH compile loop, but could you reload them?
08:07:56 <Lunar^> The difficulty is that stage 2 is normally built with RTS build in stage 1
08:08:07 <Lunar^> Which is not suitable for hOp
08:08:30 * shapr needs to reread the TH paper.
08:08:34 <Lunar^> We could imagine some hacks in the GHC build system to get around that
08:08:43 <Lunar^> Or wait until hOp is self-hosting
08:08:53 <shapr> would need a disk driver
08:09:03 <Lunar^> or a network driver
08:09:06 <shapr> right
08:09:08 <shapr> which is simpler?
08:09:15 <shapr> network would be more useful, admittedly.
08:09:17 <Lunar^> good question :)
08:09:18 * Boegel goes to the shop
08:09:31 <Lunar^> raw ethernet is not that hard I think
08:09:50 <Lunar^> We need to "hire" Tomasz
08:09:53 <Philippa> disk would probably be useful to more people, if that makes sense
08:09:54 <shapr> haha
08:10:02 <shapr> Philippa: how so?
08:10:19 <Lunar^> He seems to has a lot of network knowledge
08:10:23 <shapr> ah
08:10:31 <Lunar^> (and he his a damn efficient Haskell coder)
08:11:12 <shapr> always a good thing
08:12:11 <Philippa> shapr: everybody's got either disks or emulators that'll pretend to be them, not everybody's got a (useful) network
08:14:19 <shapr> but, if you have a network, you can mount a disk over the network.
08:14:19 <shapr> so a network driver could do more?
08:14:40 <Philippa> yeah, just not everybody could do that with it
08:22:45 <bourbaki> bk
08:24:43 <shapr> kb
08:24:58 <Philippa> error: expected statement
08:26:21 <bourbaki> kb :)?
08:31:42 <Boegel> bourbaki: reverse bk = kb :p
08:31:58 <bourbaki> that means i should go?
08:32:08 <shapr> hah, no :-P
08:32:11 <Boegel> ;)
08:32:21 <bourbaki> puh glad to hear that
08:32:32 <bourbaki> cause theres no other play for me to go
08:33:00 <Boegel> play ?
08:33:02 <Boegel> place ! :)
08:33:06 <bourbaki> yes :)
08:33:08 <shapr> #Haskell : Act I
08:33:15 <bourbaki> hehe
08:33:29 <bourbaki> im reading the tempest atm that must have crossed my mind
08:33:38 <Boegel> bourbaki: worked on your ray tracer in the last couple of days ?
08:34:06 <bourbaki> no :) im not writeing a raytracer :)
08:34:23 <bourbaki> im writeing a ... i dont even have a name for it to be honest :)
08:34:25 <Boegel> eh ? I tought (is this right?) you were
08:34:29 <Boegel> who is then ? :)
08:34:46 <bourbaki> i just said "if i would write a raytracer" then i would do it that and that way
08:34:54 <Boegel> oh, like that :)
08:35:05 <Boegel> I understood you were gonna make one too :)
08:35:18 <bourbaki> no :) but i might one day heh
08:35:36 <Boegel> :)
08:35:50 <Boegel> maybe you can use mine, and improve it
08:36:02 <Boegel> (but when I finished my thesis tough, else I look like a fool :p)
08:36:04 <bourbaki> we can work on it together
08:36:20 <Boegel> we'll, you'd have to wait until next year for that...
08:36:28 <Boegel> because I think it's not allowed for me :)
08:36:31 <bourbaki> i might like to write that perlin noise texture thing
08:36:35 <Boegel> uhu
08:36:41 <Boegel> I'll right it too possibly
08:36:47 <Boegel> cause I found info on it in a book
08:36:48 <bourbaki> ah
08:36:56 <bourbaki> well its quite easy
08:36:58 <Boegel> s/right/write
08:37:01 <Boegel> I'll see ;)
08:37:11 <Boegel> first I gotta clean up my code a bit, I'm doing that now
08:37:20 <bourbaki> and you just need to get the point in object space and plug it in there to get the texture gray scale at that point
08:37:30 <Boegel> and I wanna add another object + lighting (shading)
08:38:11 <bourbaki> sure thats good
08:38:33 <bourbaki> to me lighting is just a function
08:38:46 <bourbaki> dang i forgot the name of that book
08:39:00 <bourbaki> but its one of the standard books in comp gfx
08:39:20 <bourbaki> i still know the cover ill search it for you in amazon if you like and you can get it from the lib
08:39:32 <Boegel> I have 3 books already
08:39:45 <Boegel> Haskell School of expression (but that doesn't help me much with ray tracing)
08:39:46 <bourbaki> which ones?
08:40:21 <Boegel> Computer Graphics and Virtual Environments - From realism to real-time
08:40:36 <Boegel> that's a good one, but they explain _everything_, even the physics and stuff like that
08:40:39 <Boegel> and
08:40:52 <Boegel> Object-Oriented Ray Tracing in C++
08:41:18 <Boegel> it's a different language, I know, but they explain the basics of ray tracing quite well before showing the C++ code
08:41:20 <bourbaki> the second one has a cool cover :)
08:41:25 <Boegel> idd :)
08:41:47 <Boegel> that one was a hint of someone who wrote a ray tracer in C/C++
08:41:55 <Boegel> he used that book in school
08:42:02 <Boegel> (Dutch fellow)
08:42:20 <bourbaki> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201848406/qid=1098373314/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-0365989-8676632
08:42:30 <bourbaki> thats the book i meant it has a lot of things in there
08:43:24 <bourbaki> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568811829/ref=pd_sim_books_4/103-0365989-8676632?v=glance&s=books
08:43:32 <bourbaki> and that one is also a very good one
08:44:55 <Boegel> 1200 pages ! :)
08:44:57 <Boegel> damn :p
08:45:44 <bourbaki> hm i have to buy two new books
08:45:51 <bourbaki> gpu gems and game progging gems 4 :)
08:47:54 <Boegel> hey, linux on my laptop found my hp printer, that is connected to my desktop :o)
08:48:06 <Boegel> didn't think it was gonna be _that_ easy :)
08:48:57 <bourbaki> you sound nearly disappointed ;)
08:50:06 <Boegel> heh ;)
08:50:15 <Boegel> no, I'm glad I don't have to search to get that working
08:50:30 <Boegel> I had my problems last night with linux, it's fine now for a while ;)
08:54:49 <Boegel> bourbaki: thanks for the tips, I'll look for those books in some library's :>
08:55:02 <Boegel> or maybe even buy them, because I love ray tracing ;)
08:55:18 <Boegel> (and other graphic stuff, like 3D rendering and modelling)
08:55:28 <Boegel> hmmz, I should write a 3D modeller in Haskell ;)
08:56:57 <bourbaki> cool that would be nice
08:57:06 <Boegel> that would be really hard too :)
08:57:14 <bourbaki> if someone likes id like to discuss a functional render engine
08:57:16 <Boegel> have you seen a 3D modeller in action ?
08:58:22 * shapr hopes his reply on libraries@haskell.org effectively translated into "an' it hurt none, go for it!"
08:59:10 <Boegel> bourbaki: have you seen a 3D modeller in action ?
08:59:19 <Boegel> bourbaki: or have you worked with one ?
08:59:24 <bourbaki> none written in haskell
08:59:39 <bourbaki> i have seen a lot in action i worked as a game programmer ;)
08:59:39 <Boegel> even worked with Maya ? or 3DS Max ?
08:59:45 <Boegel> nice !
08:59:54 <Boegel> where ? which games ?
09:00:06 <Boegel> and why on earth did you stop ? :)
09:00:25 <bourbaki> well i just wanted to do something different for some time
09:00:30 <bourbaki> i worked on gothic
09:00:40 <bourbaki> and as a betatester on black and white
09:02:57 <Boegel> gothic, I think I know that one
09:03:09 <Boegel> I'd love to do that kinda work...
09:03:12 <Boegel> how did you get in?
09:05:15 <bourbaki> i just got there for an apprentice ship while i was at uni
09:05:21 <bourbaki> and then stayed there:)
09:06:23 <CosmicRay> who's +o here?  someone should /invite dash
09:07:18 <Boegel> CosmicRay: I'm guessing shapr
09:08:04 <Boegel> CosmicRay: why should we invite dash
09:08:58 <Oejet_> Labas.
09:09:08 <Boegel> hello Oejet_ :)
09:09:17 <Boegel> what does 'Labas' mean ? :>
09:09:38 <Oejet_> Labas is Lithuanian for hello.
09:09:53 <Boegel> Labas Oejet_ :)
09:11:10 <CosmicRay> Boegel: he was in here earlier asking about I/O
09:11:56 <Boegel> and what does invite do ?
09:12:02 <Boegel> I don't know that command
09:12:03 <bourbaki> Boegel: www.codecult.com
09:12:38 <Boegel> bourbaki: that's the company you worked with ?
09:14:03 <bourbaki> yep
09:14:16 <bourbaki> we also did a simulation for transrapid
09:14:24 <bourbaki> and a demo for nvidia
09:14:38 <Boegel> nice :)
09:15:24 * Boegel feels like quiting school and beginning as a game programmer
09:16:48 <bourbaki> :)
09:17:16 <Boegel> hmmz
09:17:25 <Boegel> I'm trying something here, and I get a strange error
09:17:46 <Boegel> function x y = foo where x = 10 y = 10
09:17:51 <Boegel> gives and error
09:17:52 <Boegel> but
09:17:58 <Boegel> function 10 10 = foo
09:18:00 <Boegel> doesn't
09:18:00 <Boegel> ?
09:18:25 <SyntaxNinja> what's the error
09:18:40 <Boegel> Couldn't match Double against Int
09:18:47 <Boegel> the function wants Int
09:18:50 <Boegel> but
09:19:02 <Boegel> the error is not on either of the first two arguments
09:19:07 <Boegel> but on a third
09:19:20 <SyntaxNinja> the where clause in the first version doesn't do anything
09:19:28 <SyntaxNinja> fwiw
09:19:33 <Boegel> function 10 10 (x,y) = foo where x = 10 y = 10
09:19:36 <Boegel> that's ok
09:19:43 <Boegel> function x y (x,y) = foo where x = 10 y = 10
09:19:48 <Boegel> this isn't
09:19:53 <Boegel> and I don't see a difference
09:20:11 <Boegel> btw, the (x,y) part expects x and y to be Double
09:20:15 <Boegel> maybe it's that ?
09:20:23 <SyntaxNinja> are you really reusing the same identifiers?
09:20:33 <Boegel> because function wants 2 int's as first to arg's, it sets the type to Int
09:20:46 <Boegel> but then can't except them to be Double's in (x,y) ?
09:20:49 <kosmikus> function x y (x,y) should give a syntax error
09:20:50 <Boegel> yes
09:20:57 <Boegel> because there are no other...
09:22:06 <Boegel> kosmikus: why ?
09:22:10 <kosmikus> so you're clearly not using above code and get a type error
09:22:19 <Boegel> we'll, it's like that
09:22:26 <Boegel> wait, I'll show it on the wiki
09:22:37 <Boegel> @wiki HaskellIrcPasteWiki
09:22:37 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPasteWiki
09:23:24 <thebug> @yow
09:23:25 <lambdabot> ... I live in a FUR-LINE FALLOUT SHELTER
09:23:33 <Boegel> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
09:23:33 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
09:25:32 <shapr> CosmicRay: dash was in here earlier.
09:25:38 <CosmicRay> yeah
09:25:42 <CosmicRay> I'm in #twisted now
09:25:50 <shapr> CosmicRay: I've known him for years on irc, I'm sure he'll show up if he wants to. :-)
09:26:01 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: you wrote the Libs&Tools wiki page, yah?
09:26:19 <kosmikus> Boegel: did you paste it? I can't see anything ...
09:26:27 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: originally, yeah
09:26:45 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: did you see my reply to chak? I hope it was tactful =)
09:27:37 <Boegel> kosmikus: it's pasted now... copy-paste is weird in linux (between emacs and firefox :s)
09:28:33 <Boegel> kosmikus: I've added what doesn't work and what does
09:28:57 * Boegel gets a snack (be back in 10)
09:29:16 * SyntaxNinja reads
09:29:18 <shapr> jag snackar skit!
09:30:42 <kosmikus> Boegel: all clear to me ;)
09:32:04 <kosmikus> Boegel: I'll be gone soon, so: you're using resX and resY in a division (for firstPnt, lastPnt) of which the result value is a Double (Point2D is a pair of Doubles). Now, division has type ...
09:32:08 <kosmikus> @type (/)
09:32:09 <lambdabot> (/) :: forall a. (Fractional a) => a -> a -> a
09:32:35 <kosmikus> Boegel: ... which forces resX and resY to be of the same type as the result, i.e., Double as well -- there's your conflict
09:32:58 <Boegel> kosmikus: thanks !
09:33:27 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: looks fine.
09:36:39 <pesco> shapr: "jag snackar skit!", does that mean "I snack skittles"?
09:45:17 <Boegel> hello stepcut
09:45:25 <Lemmih> "I speak dirty/crappy"?
09:46:22 <pesco> stepcut: How's your command line parser?
09:48:27 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: I guess I'm reluctant to reply to Chak because I just don't think it's going to work; it's just a feeling, though.
09:48:32 <kosmikus> pesco, stepcut: you two competing? ;)
09:49:36 <pesco> kosmikus: Not as long as he doesn't have man-pages! ;-P
09:49:46 <stepcut> pesco: non-existant :p
09:50:28 <pesco> stepcut: Oh, still in design and analysis phase?
09:50:35 <Igloo> A magic cabal submission whatsit has the best chance of working IMO, but needs someone to write it
09:50:45 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja, shapr: could you summarize the thread in a few words, please?
09:50:46 * Boegel = out
09:50:48 <Boegel> bye !
09:50:55 <Igloo> And manually tracking versions in OSes is unlikely to work at all IMO
09:51:01 <pesco> Bye Boegel.
09:51:02 <stepcut> \begin{code}
09:51:02 <stepcut> main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
09:51:02 <stepcut> \end{code}
09:51:06 <stepcut> that's all I got so far...
09:51:11 <SyntaxNinja> kosmikus: get rid of the static libraries page maintained by John & Olaf
09:51:26 <SyntaxNinja> move to the Wiki, which will have the structure that chak is describing
09:51:34 <SyntaxNinja> (build-it-they-will-come)
09:51:39 <pesco> stepcut: Hey, I wrote a very similar program once! :p
09:51:50 <kosmikus> SyntaxNinja: I see ...
09:51:59 <SyntaxNinja> then eventually move to something like Lemmih is building on top of cabal I guess
09:52:09 <stepcut> pesco: yeah, in the design phase, and I think I need to work on the Binary module first anyway
09:52:19 <pesco> stepcut: What's the Binary module?
09:54:26 <shapr> kosmikus: my idea so far has been to put Cabal descriptions into the wiki, and suck them out of the wiki once a day or so to put them into an attractive and searchable database.
09:54:38 <stepcut> pesco: A good library for reading/writing binary data (especially bit-fields). I have the module that Hal Duame III ported from nhc -> ghc, but it needs a bit more work, some additional modules, and needs to be included in the standard libs...
09:55:17 <pesco> Hm. I'm interested. Is the code online somewhere?
09:55:23 <stepcut> currenty my need for good binary library is much greater than command-line parsing
09:55:31 * SyntaxNinja points out that what Lemmih has is already almost better than what we'd get out of the wiki, IMO.
09:56:38 <stepcut> pesco: http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/haskell/NewBinary/
09:57:01 <stepcut> that is hal's stuff, you will need to change 3-4 things to get it to actually compile with ghc 6.2, but nothing big
09:57:25 <stepcut> shapr: do you have a working version in darcs anywhere ?
09:58:34 <shapr> not in darcs, but I have a working version on disk.
09:59:29 <stepcut> pesco: also, there is something written by 'deser' than generates a binary parser from a C struct.
10:00:09 <pesco> stepcut: I have a prototype for a general IO interface. Hopefully such binary libs could be integrated with it.
10:00:28 <stepcut> shapr: In unrelated news, I was thinking of writting a quote module for lambdabot that got the quotes from a wiki, does that sound interesting ?
10:00:32 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: I do like the look of lemmih's db
10:00:36 <shapr> stepcut: yes!
10:01:22 <Lemmih> shapr: Why don't you? You have the source.
10:02:59 <Lemmih> shapr: Sorry. I misread your message.
10:03:28 * Lemmih blames it on the lack of sleep.
10:05:27 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: whatever happens, I'd like to base the online listing on Cabal descriptions. That way, packages are easily installable, possibly even directly from the network.
10:05:28 <stepcut> pesco: cool, hopefully in a few weeks, I am going to scrape together all the knowledge and code I have relating to binary stuff in haskell and post to the mailing lists about finishing it off
10:05:43 <shapr> stepcut: you want a copy of NewBinary that works with 6.2.2?
10:05:48 <shapr> or do you have one?
10:06:07 <stepcut> pesco: Simon PJ (i think), has expressed interest in have the community do this work, and I really need to have it done, so...
10:06:37 <stepcut> shapr: I have one, but pesco was interested in getting a copy, and I don't have a version online either :)
10:07:02 <shapr> ah, ok
10:07:16 <shapr> stepcut: sounds like a repo is needed
10:07:17 <pesco> stepcut: Cool. I'd really like to see if the interface I've thought up (which has some edges still) could be used.
10:07:37 <shapr> shall I create a NewBinary repo on ScannedInAvian?
10:07:43 <pesco> stepcut: Have a look at the Comm module at http://www.scannedinavian.org/~pesco/ to see it.
10:08:08 <pesco> shapr: That webspace is really invaluable, thank's a lot for it!
10:09:10 <pesco> stepcut: Unfortunately the current version is written in XML, so you'll probably want to look at the PDF.
10:09:31 <pesco> stepcut: It's pending a conversion to LaTeX.
10:10:06 <shapr> pesco: glad I can help :-)
10:11:54 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: word.
10:12:22 <pesco> stepcut: Anyway, I've put the generated Haskell source next to it.
10:12:41 * SyntaxNinja feels like the effort required to carry on the thread, to move stuff from the static page, and to organize the wiki page is less than the amount required to get Lemmih's little tool working well enough to post it.
10:15:22 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: less?
10:15:46 <Lemmih> I think my solution is more dynamic than a wiki page.
10:16:41 <Igloo> Lemmih: I don't think anyone disputes that it would be better, just that it doesn't yet exist
10:17:26 <shapr> Igloo: what else does it need over what it has now?
10:17:50 <Igloo> I have no idea, but if it is actually complete and stable why not just put it in place and announce the URL?
10:18:05 <Lemmih> It's ugly and slow.
10:18:07 <Igloo> I guess there's a slight issue that we currently have very few cabalised packages, but that should be fixed anyway
10:18:23 <shapr> yah, that's part of the point of only accepting cabal.descriptions :-)
10:19:18 <shapr> well, whatever you guys think is best...
10:19:23 <Lemmih> shapr: Didn't you wanna make a wiki crawler so it would get non cabalized information?
10:19:33 <stepcut> pesco: thanks, I will take a look
10:19:41 <shapr> I wanted to make a wiki crawler so it would pick up cabal.description files off the wiki.
10:20:10 <Lemmih> Oh.
10:20:49 <stepcut> pesco: by xml, do you been docbook?
10:21:23 <shapr> Lemmih: that way deletions, insertions, and edits are extremely easy.
10:21:57 <stepcut> s/been/mean/
10:22:25 <pesco> stepcut: Yes.
10:22:33 <pesco> stepcut: It's a literate program in DocBook.
10:24:18 <SyntaxNinja> shapr: I meant 'more'
10:24:24 <stepcut> pesco: have you used docbook much ?
10:24:31 <SyntaxNinja> Igloo: but the proposed wiki page doesn't exist yet either :)
10:24:39 <shapr> SyntaxNinja: from your syntax, I thought so :-)
10:25:01 <shapr> though the ninja part was a bit deceptive...
10:25:10 <SyntaxNinja> and of course, the cabal description files aren't necessarily fixed yet
10:25:14 <Igloo> Syn: Yeah yeah  :-P
10:26:25 <SyntaxNinja> speaking of which, where has marvin-- been
10:26:31 <shapr> probably working
10:26:31 <SyntaxNinja> I want to talk to him about changing the syntax
10:26:43 <shapr> he seems pretty tired from his new job
10:27:41 <Igloo> :-/
10:27:47 <pesco> stepcut: Not really. I tought it to myself a year ago in the course of a university project.
10:28:07 <stepcut> pesco: but you prefer latex ?
10:28:56 <pesco> stepcut: Yes.
10:29:30 <stepcut> pesco: how come ? (I have never used docbook, only latex)
10:30:18 <pesco> stepcut: At least in the given context, anything I wanted to use DocBook for it (and the associated tools) were complicated and inconvenient to use, produced ugly output and made the code unreadable.
10:30:44 <pesco> Hm, that sentence was ill-formed, but you get the idea.
10:31:18 <stepcut> ok
10:31:21 <stepcut> thanks
10:31:32 <pesco> Then I found lhs2TeX and switched to LaTeX for the Cmdline module.
10:32:08 <pesco> I learned a bit of roff for the manpages and suddenly, magically, the whole affair became the most rewarding experience.
10:33:27 <pesco> With the docbook stuff (i.e. the noncommercial tools that were available to me) I was not able to produce a √è¬Ä (greek letter pi) in the output.
10:33:38 <pesco> (Did that come across correctly?)
10:34:01 <pesco> Anyway, that fact pretty much wraps it all up.
10:34:07 <stepcut> heh
10:35:42 <pesco> Oh, and should you like the idea of making manpages for your Haskell modules, I've compiled some guidelines along the way of making mine.
10:36:52 <pesco> I know there's Haddock, but I like manpages. Writing a roff backend for Haddock is on my wish-/todo-list.
10:37:49 <pesco> Ah, I need GNU autocook.
10:39:27 <shapr> unless someone needs something, I'm bailing out of irc to hack on Yi
10:39:44 <shapr> any questions?
10:39:50 <pesco> I'm fine.
10:40:02 <shapr> well then, I'm outta here...
10:40:19 <pesco> Wow. I need to take a look at Yi.
10:43:03 <pesco> Do you (anyone) know why the name Yi was chosen?
10:43:11 <stepcut> yes
10:43:36 <kristnjov> because yi is the name of yoko ono's daughter, isn't it obvious?
10:43:47 <stepcut> i think its techinacally the Y I combinators
10:43:55 <stepcut> the ultimate recursion name
10:43:57 <pesco> kristnjov: I didn't know that.
10:43:59 <kristnjov> oh, yeah that too
10:44:44 <pesco> stepcut: Oh. Ok, I'm unknowledgable.
10:45:01 <pesco> I feel bad about my lack of theoretical background.
10:45:16 <stepcut> well, I only know because I asked shapr yesterday :p
10:45:38 <stepcut> @eval Y I
10:45:56 <lambdabot> out of fuel - use @resume to continue
10:46:00 <stepcut> heh
10:46:16 <stepcut> @eval S K I
10:46:17 <lambdabot> <<EM Dynamic -> EM Dynamic>>
10:48:52 <Oejet_> @eat me
10:48:53 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "eat", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
10:50:00 <pesco> stepcut: Hm. Ah well.
10:50:37 <kristnjov> @eval transpose [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
10:50:38 <lambdabot> unbound variable: transpose
10:51:55 <stepcut> lambdabot does not know haskell yet :(
10:52:02 <stepcut> that is one of my very long term goals :)
10:52:53 <Philippa> heh
10:53:14 <Philippa> I've finally got Tyop to the point where it interprets something a bit like Core Haskell (though it does nested patterns)
10:53:20 <Philippa> OTOH, the output's pretty illegible
10:53:40 <phubuh> lambdabot once had an haskell interpreter module
10:53:49 <Oejet_> stepcut: Could one pipe lambdabot into ghci maybe in a jail? I'm very clueless in this area.
10:53:50 <phubuh> it just launched a ghci process and interacted with it
10:53:53 <Philippa> PVADT (TO 6) [PVInt 1,PVADT (TO 6) [PVInt 1,PVADT (TO 5) []]]" <- the result of "take 2 ones"
10:54:04 <Philippa> phubuh: heh. Did it have a timeout?
10:54:32 <phubuh> i'm not sure
10:55:03 <phubuh> it didn't allow the top-level evaluation of any IO actions, but someone tricked it with template haskell, or something
10:56:51 <Philippa> btw, for those wondering about the above, TO 6 is the type Cons and TO 5 is the type Nil
10:57:09 <Philippa> (yes, type not just data constructor)
10:57:38 <phubuh> types are first-class? :O
10:58:20 <Philippa> no, that's part of the representation of a value rather than the value per se - just the tag
10:58:37 <Philippa> Tyop's got a supertyping relationship, 'sall
10:59:39 <Philippa> TO 4 is most likely List, but you'll never see a value with that tag
10:59:51 <Philippa> no matching constructor :-)
11:03:35 <pesco> Can somebody confirm those characters are coming across as correctly-encoded UTF-8? √É¬§ (lower-case a Umlaut) √¢¬Ç¬¨ (euro sign) √é¬±√é¬≤√é¬≥ (alpha, beta, gamma)
11:05:00 <stepcut> pesco: not under erc
11:05:06 <Igloo> They're not
11:05:12 <stepcut> pesco: but maybe I need to configure sometthing....
11:05:13 <Igloo> None of them, in fact
11:05:17 <pesco> Grmbl. But thanks.
11:05:40 <pesco> Igloo: Can you see what it is that's sent? latin-1?
11:06:44 <Igloo> http://urchin.earth.li/~ian/foo.png
11:07:08 <Igloo> The line start "As latin-15" is how it would look in iso 8859-15 (which is actually latin 9 or something, must fix that)
11:07:29 <Igloo> The line below it is what it looks like in utf-8
11:07:53 <kristnjov> Igloo, heehee i'm on a screenshot
11:08:43 <Igloo> kristnjov: Go you!  :-)
11:08:49 <kristnjov> :)
11:11:15 <pesco> Igloo: Gah. What the hell is it doing.
11:12:39 <pesco> Igloo: Are you sure your client is parsing them as UTF-8?
11:12:53 <Igloo> In the second line, yes
11:13:12 <Igloo> What is your $LANG, $LC_ALL and $LC_CTYPE?
11:13:25 <pesco> Hello, pesco_.
11:13:29 <pesco> Meet my evil twin.
11:13:37 <Igloo> :-)
11:13:37 <pesco> de_DE.UTF-8
11:17:01 <Igloo> What does this look like for you? Œ±Œ≤
11:17:06 <kristnjov> an alien
11:17:41 <pesco> Igloo: For me? It looks perfect. I'm using unicode-rxvt.
11:17:53 <stepcut> Igloo: what does this look like to you: √é¬±√é¬≤
11:17:59 <Oejet_> Igloo: I see \alpha\beta
11:18:01 <Igloo> You're just generating the wrong stuff then
11:18:13 <pesco> stepcut: I see \alpha\beta too.
11:18:14 <Igloo> √é¬±√é¬≤ as unicode
11:18:47 <pesco> Igloo: Any idea which part of the chain is at fault?
11:19:09 <Igloo> stepcut: Was that meant to be alpha beta?
11:19:10 * stepcut sees a I with a little hat, a + with a _ underneath, the I with a hat again, and a superscript 2
11:19:24 <stepcut> Igloo: I just hit C-k C-y
11:19:46 <stepcut> Igloo: i wondered if it would copy and paste right even if it did not display right (on my machine)
11:20:20 <Igloo> pesco: No idea, sorry
11:20:29 <Igloo> I just know how to make it show stuff right  :-)
11:20:47 <Igloo> stepcut: There is probably a latin-n control character in there or something
11:21:28 <Igloo> stepcut: Hang on, are you using utf-8 or latin-n?
11:22:28 * Igloo gets confused
11:24:47 <stepcut> Igloo: beats me
11:24:57 <Igloo> :-)
11:25:19 <stepcut> stepcut: erc+emacs+whatever you get if you install debian and don't configure any locale stuff
11:27:52 <stepcut> which should I use, utf-8 or latin-n ?
11:28:20 <pesco> UTF-8.
11:29:07 <stepcut> ok, I may have set utf-8 in emacs now...
11:29:53 <stepcut> now I just need someone to send some distinctly utf-8
11:30:02 <Igloo> Œ±Œ≤
11:30:11 <stepcut> hrm, I got to empty boxes :(
11:30:21 <Igloo> That probably means it's working but you don't have the right fonts
11:30:48 <stepcut> that's what I am thinking
11:31:07 * Igloo doesn't understand fonts and X yet though, so can't help
11:31:46 <stepcut> do I need an iso8859-15 font or something ?
11:32:20 <stepcut> oh! I changed the font and now it see and alpha beta :)
11:32:32 <Igloo> Cool  :-)
11:38:40 <stepcut> now I just need to memorize all the greek character codes :-/
11:39:18 * Igloo needs to find a cheat-sheet for common things
11:39:35 <pesco> stepcut: I have the greek keyboard layout bound to a second group with XKB.
11:39:36 <Igloo> Currently I just have 3 key bindings in irssi for ‚ô•, ‚òª and :-√æ
11:39:44 <stepcut> heh
11:39:49 <joao> Hello all
11:39:51 <thebug> my terminal loved that ...
11:39:55 <pesco> And I set caps lock to toggle between the two.
11:40:01 <Igloo> thebug: Join us!
11:40:07 <thebug> yay!
11:40:19 <Igloo> pesco: Have you got a good URL for that? Or failing that, can we see your script?
11:41:16 <pesco> Igloo: In xorg.conf I have XkbModel set to "dvorak,el" and XkbOption to "grp:caps_toggle"
11:41:45 <pesco> s/Model/Layout/
11:42:04 <Igloo> Does el mean Greek?
11:42:26 <kristnjov> el as in hellas :/
11:42:26 <pesco> Or try the cmd setxkbmap -rules xorg -model whateveryouhave -layout whatever,el -option grp:caps_toggle
11:42:31 <pesco> Yes, el is Greek.
11:43:23 <Igloo> OK, ta. I've made a note for when I come to play with such things  :-)
11:43:39 <pesco> Ok. I've got to go, see you all.
11:44:16 <thebug> this terminal is just bad ... I can't type any interesting characters
11:44:27 * thebug hates Konsole :/
11:45:27 <Igloo> So don't use it?  :-)
11:45:41 <mattam> i can type ﬂ in my Konsole
11:46:47 <thebug> indeed , I generally don't ... though I'm on a different machine atm
11:47:15 <stepcut> Œ±
11:47:17 <stepcut> :p
11:47:21 <stepcut> did that work ?
11:48:25 <stepcut> œÄ
11:48:28 <Igloo> That was a utf-8 alpha, yup
11:48:32 <Igloo> And pi
11:48:40 <Igloo> mattam: How do you type beta?
11:49:04 <stepcut> ‚úì
11:49:06 <stepcut> tehehe
11:49:25 <stepcut> f : a ‚Üí b
11:49:40 <Igloo> :-)
11:50:00 <Igloo> stepcut: Are you copying from gucharmap or something?
11:50:08 <stepcut> http://www1.tip.nl/~t876506/UnicodeDisplay.html
11:50:18 <stepcut> but, in emacs, I am using the TeX input method
11:50:26 <Igloo> Ah, cunning
11:50:29 <stepcut> so I have to do somtthing like \alpha
11:50:36 <stepcut> and it automatically replaces it with alpha
11:50:44 <stepcut> but I don't know what half the characters are called
11:50:53 <stepcut> like 10163
11:51:10 <Igloo> 10163 decimal?
11:51:41 <stepcut> Igloo: i think so, whatever has 10163 next to it on that page I pasted
11:51:50 <Igloo> ‚û≥ ?
11:51:54 <stepcut> yeah
11:52:05 <mattam> altgr-s, it is an ssharp in fact
11:52:17 <Igloo> Ah, right
11:52:27 * Igloo has no idea either on the arrow
11:52:38 <stepcut> hrm, I think i am going to try some different input methods
11:53:00 <stepcut> Is there a character set that has forall, exists, etc ?
11:53:19 <Igloo> utf-8 has pretty much everything
11:53:22 <mattam> unicode
11:53:36 <mattam> 2200 iirc
11:53:50 <stepcut> Oh, I think my font in konqueror does not, so a bunch of things are showing up as empty boxes :)
11:53:51 <Igloo> Yup, and U+2203: ‚àÄ‚àÉ
11:53:58 <Igloo> gucharmap allows you to search for them by name
11:53:59 <stepcut> yeah, that works
11:54:01 <stepcut> ‚àÄ
11:54:02 <stepcut> heh
11:54:05 <stepcut> ‚àÉ
11:54:25 <mattam> in gtk you can input them usin ctrl+shift+unicode
11:54:55 <mattam> in qt i'd like to know
11:56:20 <stepcut> darn, sending unicode over AIM seems to kick me offline :(
11:57:21 <mattam> reminds me of some bash.org quote ;)
11:57:30 <stepcut> hrm...
11:59:37 <mattam> this one: http://bash.org/?13213
12:14:54 <stepcut> heh
12:16:42 <kristnjov> and for no particular reason i just have to paste this.. www.40plus50plus.com
12:23:47 <musasabi> is there in some point in that?
12:28:06 <joao> Error monad is Control.Monad.Error ?
12:32:09 <joao> btw, is it possible to see the code that a .hi defines?
12:32:36 <joao> --show-iface ?
12:41:01 <Igloo> You can't see the Haskell source, no
12:41:43 <joao> Is there any Error monad defined?
12:44:24 <musasabi> Control.Monad.Error ?
12:46:18 <joao> But I'd like to see how the datatype is defined... that's why I'd like to see the code :)
12:47:27 <Igloo> It's in the GHC tarball, or in CVS (which you can view on the web)
12:47:54 <joao> Ok, thanks :)
12:53:22 <lmbdwr> hi ppl
12:53:53 <lmbdwr> except the blue calculus, is there anything more expressive than lambda calculus and pi calculus ?
12:55:02 <vivek> lambda calculus is the forfather of haskell right ?
12:57:23 <lmbdwr> vivek, afaik yes. But there exist other calculus more expressive than it 
12:57:35 <lmbdwr> btw, whats the difference between 'calculus' and 'calculi' ?
12:58:20 <Igloo> calculi is the plural
12:58:26 <vivek> and is it used in haskell or just lambda calculus ?
12:58:39 <vivek> the better caluclus ie 
12:58:41 <lmbdwr> Igloo, thx
12:59:55 <lmbdwr> vivek, afaik, all functionnal langages uses abstractions and applications, so their construction verify the lambda calculus properties, maybe someone will correct me ..
13:38:28 <CosmicRay> anyone seen syntaxninja?
13:39:39 <Igloo> [21:36] -!- SyntaxNinja [~ijones@dhcp024-208-189-033.columbus.rr.com] has quit ("boxes!")
13:39:45 <CosmicRay> foo.
13:39:46 <Igloo> (It's now 21:39)
13:41:25 * CosmicRay resorts to e-mail.
13:41:26 <CosmicRay> sigh
13:41:52 * CosmicRay goes to fix all the stuff that had its deps broken by ghc 6.2.2
13:44:01 <CosmicRay> cabal is one of those effected things
13:52:46 <CosmicRay> shapr: did you say you have the internetlib sources somewhere?
13:52:53 <CosmicRay> I still haven't been able to track them down
13:53:51 <CosmicRay> trying to see if I can avoid reinventing the wheel for a ftp client module
13:57:52 <Igloo> CosmicRay: Has this stuff hit Debian now then?
13:58:03 <CosmicRay> Igloo: the new ghc6 has
13:58:04 <Igloo> Or do you mean just the bits installed on your machine?
13:58:11 <CosmicRay> Igloo: all the other stuff is still in Incoming
13:58:17 <Igloo> Right, OK
13:58:20 <CosmicRay> but will be broken the moment it hits sid unless it's fixed
13:59:21 <Igloo> *nod* - I think it's probably better to wait until ghc6 has built on most arches before prodding people though - or do you disagree?
14:01:16 <CosmicRay> no, build-deps can solve that one
14:01:38 <CosmicRay> besides it'll be broken on the majority of debian machines since i386 is by far the most popular
14:02:27 <Igloo> But in practice you have to wait an age for some arches to requeue
14:03:09 <CosmicRay> yeah, I know, but I don't think it's a good idea to try to time an upload to NEW to coincide with a guesstimate of autobuilder timings
14:03:15 <CosmicRay> I'd rather upload the correct code now
14:03:55 <CosmicRay> besides if they're bogged down enough, it'll be awhile till they get to the new haskell stuff anyway
14:04:01 <Igloo> Oh, I'm really talking about packages that are already in Debian
14:04:12 <CosmicRay> yeah, these are all stuck in NEW
14:04:22 <CosmicRay> which sucks.  It's been more than 2 weeks.
14:04:36 <Igloo> That case is different, true. I don't think NEW gets autobuilt for one
14:04:44 <CosmicRay> no, it doesn't
14:04:53 <CosmicRay> nothing gets autobuilt until it hits one of the main dists
14:05:06 <Igloo> No, stuff in incoming gets autobuilt
14:05:13 <CosmicRay> NEW isn't even publically-available.
14:05:18 <CosmicRay> really?
14:05:20 <CosmicRay> that seems broken
14:05:21 <Igloo> yup
14:05:25 <CosmicRay> when did that start
14:05:40 <CosmicRay> are you sure you don't mean ACCEPTED?
14:05:51 <CosmicRay> ie, the incoming stuff that has passed the dinstall checks
14:06:15 <Igloo> OK, I'm not sure what the technical name for it is, but after the thing that happens every 15 mins
14:08:19 <CosmicRay> I think that's ACCEPTED
14:13:45 <Boegel> hello :)
14:13:54 <Lemmih> Hey Boegel
14:21:36 <Boegel> hello yohanm 
14:22:24 <yohanm> heya Boegel, hows it going?
14:22:49 <Boegel> nice :)
14:23:02 <Boegel> I finally found the time to get to work on my code a bit again
14:23:09 <Boegel> taking classes means you're always busy :(
14:23:31 <yohanm> great, ive got a math test tomorrow i think ill fail if i dont know the answers to all the questions somehow without reason
14:23:32 <Boegel> yohanm, are you new ?
14:23:42 <yohanm> nice, do you go to college?
14:23:51 <yohanm> im pretty new, first year in college for me :]
14:23:54 <Boegel> yohanm, what are you studying ? where are you from ?
14:24:11 <kristnjov> don't talk to that guy man, he's a racist :/
14:24:17 <Boegel> I meant is it your first time in #haskell ?
14:24:24 <Boegel> racist ?
14:24:25 <Boegel> :s
14:24:57 <yohanm> Boegel im from sweden and i study comp science, its been pretty interesting yet 
14:25:10 <yohanm> nah ive been here with my stupid questions a couple of times before :)
14:25:25 <yohanm> kristnjov's a nazi
14:25:36 <yohanm> and an asshole (his own words)
14:28:39 <Boegel> hello SyntaxNinja 
14:28:45 <SyntaxNinja> hi
14:30:09 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: did you get my e-mail?
14:37:16 <SyntaxNinja> CosmicRay: I already replied
14:48:42 <Boegel> hello rhaaw 
14:48:44 <CosmicRay> SyntaxNinja: thanks, got it
14:49:11 <Boegel> rhaaw, new ?
14:50:29 <rhaaw> Boegel, Kind of. I've been lurking here for the past few days, perhaps a week.
14:50:54 <Boegel> have you had the tour ? :)
14:51:30 <rhaaw> Boegel, I don't think so. I belive shapr said something about it, but I asked him to postpone until I finish reading craft2e =)
14:51:44 <Boegel> what's craft2e ? don't know it...
14:52:28 <rhaaw> The book. Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming, second edition.
14:52:51 <Boegel> how big is it ?
14:53:03 <rhaaw> Give me a second.
14:53:05 <Matt-W> not very
14:53:19 <Matt-W> my copy's about 2cm thick
14:53:23 <Matt-W> got some good pages in it though
14:53:25 <rhaaw> About 400 pages.
14:53:33 <Boegel> and how far are yuo rhaaw  ?
14:53:34 <rhaaw> Minus introduction, index, etc.
14:54:03 <rhaaw> Boegel, I've been distracted by some C++ projects I have. I only read about 100 pages.
14:54:28 <Boegel> and what do you think of it ?
14:54:37 <Boegel> btw, you won't learn it by reading :)
14:55:36 <rhaaw> Boegel, I dislike learning by example - reading source files to understand a programming language.
14:57:12 <Boegel> hey monochrom 
14:57:26 <Boegel> rhaaw, why ? i think you learn it mutch faster that way...
14:57:51 <monochrom> hey
14:58:28 <bourbaki> imho you learn a language best when you write code
14:58:48 <musasabi> Is there a way to evaluate something completely n-times ?
14:58:53 <bourbaki> its like with speaking a new language you wont learn it by listening to others speak it either really
15:00:04 <Boegel> musasabi, how do you mean evaluate ?
15:00:45 <CosmicRay> rhaaw: you dislike learning by example?
15:00:55 <monochrom> It is hard to force Haskell to re-evaluate an already-evaluated expression.
15:02:40 <Boegel> musasabi, why would you want to do that ?
15:03:00 <musasabi> I know, I am trying to fix some things in the computer language shootout and the test is "do pure operation N times and return the result of last evaluation".
15:03:29 <monochrom> That is a rigged shootout.
15:03:39 <Boegel> musasabi, computer language shootout ?
15:03:43 <monochrom> To preclude non-strict languages.
15:04:19 <Boegel> i don't get it, but nevermind :)
15:04:23 <monochrom> "if your language cannot re-evaluate exactly the same thing 1000 times it's out!"
15:04:40 <monochrom> may as well say "if your compiler does constant folding it's out!"
15:05:54 <monochrom> For the same reason I also disbelieve in Paul Graham's criterion "write a program to increment a state variable".  Biased.
15:05:54 <musasabi> Boegel: shootout.alioth.debian.org
15:06:54 <musasabi> monochrom: They try to make the tests not be like that, it is that people without understanding of finer languages often choose things like that.
15:08:14 <Boegel> musasabi, what's the use of that shootout ?
15:09:01 <monochrom> They are worse than that.  They have nothing better to do.  "Repeat the same task N times."  What kind of benchmark is that?  40 years ago we already had those in whetstone drystone etc. and 30 years ago we already knew all Fortran compilers cheated on those.  Haven't we learned from history yet?
15:09:04 <musasabi> Boegel: advocasy based on poor facts and fun.
15:10:32 <monochrom> Who cares about N-time repetition?  Real benchmarks are about solving problems.  Things like "what would LZW look like in this language and how fast will it run" are better.
15:11:09 <musasabi> monochrom: well this does matrix multiplication and it has a shared writeset, only that making the code pure highlights that it is possible to do in just one simple way.
15:11:53 <bourbaki> why does that kind of stuff matter anyway?
15:12:11 <bourbaki> programmers dont write fast code anymore really anyway
15:12:44 <bourbaki> i wont pick a language because its fast but because of its ability to solve a problem elegantly
15:13:48 <bourbaki> i think that the bigger a project gets the more important that will get over local speed of a language (but i maybe wrong just a personal thought)
15:15:04 <monochrom> Yeah many of those people responsible for many of those shootouts are detached from reality.
15:15:36 <monochrom> The irony is they get to call themselves "the real world" and call us "unrealistic academics ivory tower" etc.
15:15:49 <bourbaki> heh
15:16:33 <bourbaki> imho is haskell really cool because of its syntax i dont care about speed if i would id have to do asm
15:16:48 <monochrom> "All these lazy languages doing on-demand evaluation and memoization by you academic people are all very well.  In the real world we repeat computing 1+1 for N times!"  Yeah right I'll buy that.
15:17:34 <Boegel> monochrom, :)
15:18:28 <Pyoko> what's the wiki url again
15:19:26 <musasabi> haskell.org/hawiki
15:19:29 <Pyoko> ty
15:23:39 <Boegel> Pyoko, type @wiki and lambdabot will help you
15:23:42 <Boegel> @wiki
15:23:42 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/
15:23:55 <Pyoko> ooh, nifty
15:23:58 <Boegel> :)
15:24:21 <Boegel> I'm going to bed unfortunatly
15:24:29 <Boegel> but I have a class in 8 hours, so :s
15:24:37 <Boegel> good night everyone !
15:25:20 <Pyoko> g'night
15:25:23 <Pyoko> doh
15:27:55 <bourbaki> ?
15:28:14 <bourbaki> then he could stay at least 7 more hours here
15:46:16 <stepcut> @arr
15:46:16 <lambdabot> Shiver me timbers!
16:00:09 <dons> moin
16:04:03 <Igloo> Anyone know how I can ask hunit not to fall over if a test calls error?
16:06:57 <dons> reminds me to write unit tests for yi
16:26:30 <musasabi> Any idea what would cause cvs-ghc to create undefined references to DataziTuple_Z1T_con_info with parallel parallel array comprehensions?
16:26:49 <stepcut> no..
16:28:42 <dons> that's a tricky one
16:34:10 <musasabi> http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ekarttun/haskell/test.hs demonstrates it, is that worth reporting or just cvs instablity?
16:34:33 <Pseudonym> Go ahead and report it.  At least it'll get added to the regression suite.
16:37:22 <Igloo> I get the same, and an impossible "Name.mkTupNameStr: 1 ???" with ghc 6.2.2
16:37:54 * Igloo disappears
16:38:33 <dons> hmm. let me try the head.
16:38:55 <musasabi> head is the one getting the undefined references.
16:39:18 <dons> test.o(.text+0x393): In function `s1TW_info':
16:39:19 <dons> : undefined reference to `DataziTuple_Z1T_con_info'
16:39:20 * musasabi adds data to his old parr bug - seems I stumbled upon this before
16:39:37 <dons> time to report it!
17:22:08 <pesco> Hello again.
17:23:36 <pesco> Here's an Umlaut: √§. Did it come through this time?
17:24:52 <pesco> Shuff'ling around, eh.
17:37:37 <nTfirewall> i need help on haskell code
17:37:53 <nTfirewall> can some1 help plz
17:38:02 <Pseudonym> Perhaps.
17:38:13 <nTfirewall> cud i send u my .hs file
17:38:27 <Pseudonym> Once again, perhaps.
17:38:34 <Pseudonym> How about you describe your problem first?
17:38:59 <nTfirewall> i am working on college worksheet
17:39:06 <nTfirewall> n i am stuck on a question 
17:39:26 <Pseudonym> With you so far.
17:39:39 <nTfirewall> it b easier for u look at it to undestnd wht i need to do
17:40:07 <Pseudonym> Is the problem that you have code that won't compile?
17:40:11 <nTfirewall> there is a question where i need to print members information from the code the given
17:40:14 <Pseudonym> Or is it that you can't solve the problem?
17:40:16 <nTfirewall> yea
17:40:26 <Pseudonym> OK.  What's your error message?
17:40:27 <nTfirewall> both actually
17:41:04 <nTfirewall> type does not match 
17:41:21 <nTfirewall> but i trying so many things dont know wht is rite way to do it
17:41:28 <Pseudonym> Oh, what implementation are you using?  GHC?  Hugs?
17:41:32 <nTfirewall> hugs
17:41:36 <Pseudonym> Gotcha.
17:41:44 <Pseudonym> Can you paste the full error message?
17:42:26 <nTfirewall> but i dont think  i doin it rite so the error msg doesnt matter
17:42:50 <nTfirewall> should i upload it somewhere n u could look at it
17:43:18 <Pseudonym> How big is it?
17:43:27 <nTfirewall> less then a page
17:43:31 <Pseudonym> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
17:43:31 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
17:43:36 <Pseudonym> That's the usual paste location.
17:45:34 <nTfirewall> there is no place to paste the code
17:45:52 <Pseudonym> You go to "Edit Text" down the bottom.
17:46:01 <Pseudonym> If you don't like that, you can use www.nomorepasting.com
17:46:13 <ayrnieu> Or you can start your own wiki, smartypants.
17:46:31 <desrt> woh.  hostile.
17:48:17 <nTfirewall> ok Pseudonym
17:48:22 <nTfirewall> i have psated it
17:48:54 <Pseudonym> OK...
17:50:24 <Pseudonym> Hmmm.
17:50:26 <ayrnieu> oh my, Dr. Iverson has died.
17:50:35 <Pseudonym> So what exactly are you trying to display?
17:51:32 <nTfirewall> when we use fnction members it should display members 
17:51:40 <desrt> ayrnieu; who is this?
17:51:47 <nTfirewall> [ " neil", " fred"]
17:51:58 <pesco> nTfirewall: Try to state clearly what you are trying to accomplish.
17:51:59 <Pseudonym> OK.
17:52:00 <ayrnieu> desrt - inventor of APL.
17:52:02 <Pseudonym> So what did you try?
17:52:10 <desrt> ayrnieu; oh.  wow.
17:52:18 <Pseudonym> Oh, goodness.
17:52:27 <ayrnieu> the J mailing list has his obituary.
17:52:27 <Pseudonym> How old was he?
17:52:32 <ayrnieu> 83.
17:52:35 * Pseudonym nods
17:52:41 <nTfirewall> i tried to do this members xs = head[x:vstore] but this wont work 
17:52:41 <desrt> J was APL for ascii, right?
17:52:44 <Pseudonym> I use Iverson syntax in my working often.
17:53:02 <Pseudonym> nTfirewall: You can see that tye type of VStore is a list, right?
17:53:09 <ayrnieu> desrt - it's more complex than that, but OK.
17:53:18 <nTfirewall> yes
17:53:55 <nTfirewall> is there a difference b/w vstore and VStore?
17:54:52 <pesco> VStore is a type. vstore is a value.
17:55:52 <Pseudonym> What you have is a problem that maps lists to lists.
17:56:01 <Pseudonym> When you have one of those, there are three general ways to do it.
17:56:04 <Pseudonym> 1. List comprehensions.
17:56:09 <Pseudonym> 2. map/filter/fold etc
17:56:11 <Pseudonym> 3. Recursion.
17:56:17 <Pseudonym> Have you seen list comprehensions?
17:56:35 <nTfirewall> something like this rite ...  x< - xs 
17:57:03 <pesco> Aarh. The spelling.
17:57:12 <nTfirewall> right**
17:57:18 <pesco> Sorry.
17:58:01 <nTfirewall> pesco .. VStore has value Custmor ? 
17:58:21 <nTfirewall> Customer*
18:01:05 <nTfirewall> hello
18:01:12 <nTfirewall> what happend
18:01:23 <Pseudonym> Sorry, did something happen?
18:01:35 <Pseudonym> When you're doing it as a list comprehension, generally what you want to do is decide what you want to do to each individual element.
18:01:47 <Pseudonym> So you want something of type [Customer] -> [Name]
18:01:54 <Pseudonym> So work out how to do Customer -> Name first
18:02:00 <Pseudonym> Make sense?
18:03:06 <nTfirewall> but name is not a list in the code
18:03:36 <Pseudonym> --members :: VStore -> [Name]
18:03:39 <Pseudonym> That's directly from your code.
18:06:02 <Pseudonym> OK, let's start a bit earlier.
18:06:09 <Pseudonym> Do you know what the "type" declaration means?
18:06:17 <nTfirewall> yes 
18:06:23 <Pseudonym> Take this for example:
18:06:24 <Pseudonym> type VStore   = [Customer]
18:06:31 <Pseudonym> You know what that means?
18:06:32 <Pseudonym> type VStore   = [Customer]
18:06:41 <Pseudonym> Sorry, didn't mean to do that twice.
18:06:49 <nTfirewall> VStore is a list of type customer
18:07:13 <Pseudonym> Right.
18:07:28 <Pseudonym> In particular, VStore is a _type_.
18:07:36 <Pseudonym> Right?
18:07:49 <Pseudonym> You understand the concept of a "type"?
18:08:06 <nTfirewall> i guess so but not to gr8 extend
18:08:12 * Pseudonym nods
18:09:58 <nTfirewall> is this same VStore = [ Name, Int, Int, Int ] as type VStore   = [Customer]
18:10:15 <Pseudonym> I think you left out some parentheses there.
18:10:56 <nTfirewall> VStore = (Name, Int, Int, Int) as type VStore   = [Customer]
18:11:09 <nTfirewall> are they same ?
18:11:42 <Pseudonym> No.
18:11:52 <Pseudonym> The one on the left is a tuple and the one on the right is a list.
18:12:54 <nTfirewall> VStore = [ (Name, Int, Int, Int) ] as type VStore   = [Customer]   < what about this 
18:13:38 <Pseudonym> Yes, they're the same.
18:13:50 <Pseudonym> Because of the definition of Customer.
18:13:58 <nTfirewall> is a tuple
18:14:07 <Pseudonym> Right.
18:14:12 <nTfirewall> kool
18:14:19 <nTfirewall> that bit is clear :)
18:14:23 <Pseudonym> Good.
18:14:25 <Pseudonym> :-)
18:17:11 <nTfirewall> vstore = [cust1, cust2] < what can we say about this ? 
18:17:29 <nTfirewall> vstore a variable holding a list ?
18:25:35 <nTfirewall> ok Pseudonym 
18:25:42 <nTfirewall> thanks for your help :)
18:26:02 <nTfirewall> take care i m off to sleep
18:26:02 <Pseudonym> vstore is a variable (though the term "variable" is a bit of a misnomer in Haskell)
18:26:06 <Pseudonym> OK, go sleep.
18:26:29 <nTfirewall> cheers 
18:26:32 <nTfirewall> thanks again
18:26:42 <nTfirewall> n others who helped
18:26:44 <nTfirewall> bye
18:27:18 * Pseudonym hates playing 20 questions with people who want help
19:40:48 <shapr> dons: got a moment?
19:41:02 <shapr> oh, idle for three hours... maybe not.
19:43:27 <dons> yep
19:43:46 <dons> not idle! hacking yi :)
19:43:55 <shapr> right, I meant idle on IRC :-)
19:44:08 <dons> i know ;)
19:44:24 <dons> unless you have telepathic powers..
19:44:26 <shapr> I got started fixing some bugs I found and got distracted into trying to make an arrow instance for Buffer
19:44:34 <dons> nice
19:44:36 <shapr> telepathetic powers maybe...
19:45:12 <dons> I've done a rewrite of the buffer with a slightly cleaner interface
19:45:22 <shapr> anyway, I couldn't come up with a general arrow instance, but I do think I can make an arrow instance for Yampa
19:45:45 <shapr> seems I'm not the only one thinking that, the Yampa mailing list mentions Jon Cast wants to use Yampa for a text editor some months back.
19:45:59 <dons> really. that's interesting
19:46:05 <dons> what does it buy us?
19:46:31 <shapr> lots of good stuff, but my question is, will writing a buffer arrow alienate the average Haskeller?
19:46:48 <dons> hmm.
19:47:02 <dons> so it depends on how much stuff is exposed
19:47:10 <shapr> good point
19:47:44 <dons> if between Buffer => Editor => Core => UI this is serious magic, that is fine
19:47:47 <shapr> also, I am somewhat convinced that using arrows buys a bunch of good stuff, but I could still be wrong.
19:48:01 <shapr> that's exactly the magic I'm talking about.
19:48:02 <dons> as long as the outer world has a fairly non-scary interface
19:48:06 <shapr> right
19:48:47 <dons> Buffer should at least be a monad, anyway, considering the sequencing and state manipulation
19:49:00 <dons> so, I'm quite open to this
19:49:38 <dons> I think if you can hack up some example code of what, say, the Core primops would look like, that would help
19:49:55 <Pseudonym> Making more libraries that use arrows might be a good thing.
19:50:01 <Pseudonym> It'd encourage people to be familiar with them.
19:50:26 <dons> that's true
19:50:34 <shapr> the simple buffer I'm staring at right now is just "data SimpleBufferState = SimpleBufferState {  text :: String, point :: Location }" and "type SimpleBuffer = SF YiInput SimpleBufferState"
19:51:19 <shapr> I just read the Yampa Arcade paper and did the 'paint by number' bit for a Buffer Arrow instead...
19:51:44 <dons> so YiInput is what?
19:52:01 <shapr> keychars, mouse signals, network, whatever.
19:52:11 <dons> ok.
19:52:18 <shapr> this is just a first hack
19:52:52 <shapr> it'll probably need lots of changing, as I'm still approaching it from how the space invaders demo works.
19:53:21 <dons> ok. but this seems a good approach.
19:53:45 <shapr> oh, I found a bug when I hit i and enter
19:53:55 <dons> it messes with the screen
19:53:57 <shapr> that's actually what I was trying to fix when I got distracted into this :-)
19:54:23 <shapr> I was thinking of how to fix all the off-by-one errors once and for all.
19:54:47 <shapr> Pseudonym: you have any arrows advice?
19:54:49 <dons> but the enter issue is because we're not catching KeyEnter atm, I think.
19:54:56 <shapr> ah, I see
19:55:17 <dons> so I don't think it actually touches the buffer itself, does it?
19:55:29 <dons> anyway, was intending to get round to that pretty soon.
19:55:34 <dons> btw.. how's scrolling going?
19:55:36 <dons> ;)
19:55:42 <shapr> something weird happens such that only the rightmost column has ~ in it.
19:55:49 <shapr> I got distracted from scrolling too :-)
19:55:49 <dons> after Enter?
19:55:56 <shapr> I'll get back to that before the arrow stuff.
19:56:12 <shapr> 'daily or die' and arrows can come later.
19:56:23 <dons> yeah, good philosophy
19:57:01 <dons> also, I don't want to write too many more primops without starting on the generalised lexer key bindings
19:57:22 <dons> otherwise too much vi behaviour will end up in the Core, and just have to be ripped out
19:57:28 <shapr> right
19:57:49 <shapr> even so, if we reach a haskell vim that's totally dynloadable, we can still go from there.
19:58:14 <shapr> as long as it works
19:58:39 <dons> yeah, I will probably develop vim bindings only, but if the vim-emulation can all be done in, say, ~/.yi/Keys.hs, then that should keep things clean
19:59:42 <shapr> yah, would be nice.
20:00:27 * dons actually installed emacs yesterday
20:00:31 <shapr> since you've done 99% of the code so far, feel free to do vim bindings. Any discussion from others should happen via submitted patches =)
20:00:47 <shapr> And I've been reading up on vim :-)
20:00:49 <dons> so I'm serious about multi-editor front ends
20:01:23 <dons> people keep suggesting crazy emacs things I've never heard of, so I have to work out what they're talking about first, and then how to do it :}
20:01:26 <shapr> oh, if arrows are a good core, the buffer list will be easy to do.
20:01:41 <dons> for undo/redo? or multi-buffers?
20:01:49 <shapr> multi-buffers
20:01:52 * shapr thinks about undo/redo
20:01:55 <dons> btw, did you see we can display multiple buffers atm
20:02:04 <dons> ./yi-inplace README Makefile
20:02:11 <dons> use 'N' or 'R' to cycle focus
20:02:23 <ozone> dons: 
20:02:27 <ozone> multi-editor frontends?
20:02:32 <ozone> why? :)
20:02:36 <dons> ozone: keybindings are just syntax, dude.
20:02:39 <shapr> um, yeah... I think it could be done for undo/redo, if you save continuations of earlier buffer states 
20:03:08 <ozone> what exactly do you mean by frontend?
20:03:12 <shapr> actually, that might work really well
20:03:18 <dons> yeah. continuations seem the fp way to go, but could be heavy weight
20:03:32 <dons> ozone: front end to an editor is the key strokes
20:03:35 <dons> back end is the ui
20:03:43 <dons> the editor compiles key strokes to ui actions
20:03:55 <ozone> back end is the UI?
20:04:05 <ozone> you're deviating from standard terminology, i think
20:04:06 <dons> so use a lexer and parser to parse the key strokes
20:04:12 <ozone> anyway
20:04:18 <shapr> the Yampa way is to stick a bunch of signal functions into a collection, then when something happens to change that collection (open a new buffer, kill an existing buffer) freeze everything back into continuations, frob the collection and restart.
20:04:29 <shapr> I don't know how heavy a buffer continuation would be with Yampa.
20:04:36 <ozone> yeah, sure, configurable keybindings are of course the way to go
20:04:45 <shapr> On the good side, Yampa has been used for real-time real-world industrial robotics :-)
20:04:49 <ozone> the joe editor did that quite nicely
20:05:36 <shapr> of course, I'm assuming that buffers are each their own arrow. It's possible that a finer granularity is better.
20:05:47 * shapr thinks about finer granularity.
20:06:05 <shapr> oh yeah, global modes could easily be their own arrow.
20:06:12 <shapr> and buffer local modes too
20:06:17 <shapr> just depends on how you route it.
20:06:43 <dons> ok. so we could do a lot of the tricky stuff this way. i'll have to start looking at this stuff
20:07:46 <shapr> I snitched a copy of yampa arcade out of cvs on www.haskell.org since I couldn't find it anywhere else.
20:08:05 <shapr> I use it with the 6.3 debs since they have HSX11 and HGL out of the box.
20:08:27 * shapr builds a tarball.
20:19:24 <Pseudonym> Sorry, back from lunch.
20:19:29 <Pseudonym> No, no arrows advice.
20:23:16 <shapr> dons: maybe I should have sent that to the list :-)
20:23:19 * shapr shrugs
20:24:13 <dons> oh well. we'll probably get more stuff related to this to talk about
20:25:51 <shapr> yup
20:29:13 * shapr admires multibuffer support in yi
20:30:02 <dons> hehe. pretty easy in haskell
20:30:19 <dons> but someone should pretty the gui up ;)
20:30:29 <shapr> :-)
20:31:11 <dons> you know those hacks, where you start out thinking it will take, say, 4 hours, and after 6 you think it might be another 4 yet?
20:31:21 <dons> i'm right in that now
20:31:24 <shapr> oh yes
20:31:24 <shapr> very much
20:31:47 <shapr> I usually get frustrated about ten hours into a one hour hack and give it up.
20:31:51 <ozone> dons: at least you're not struggling with libtool :}
20:32:04 <shapr> ozone: you know anything about arrows or yampa?
20:32:38 <ozone> not anything that'll help you i think, sorry
20:32:45 <shapr> ah well
20:32:51 <ozone> (i.e. not as much much as you guys)
20:33:10 <shapr> I feel pretty clueless when I try to hack around with arrows.
20:34:41 <maihem> I feel pretty clueless when I hack around with main :: IO (), so don't feel too bad :)
20:34:43 <dons> ah ha! now I know how to make the mvar synchronisation on buffers fine grained
20:34:50 <dons> no more big lock on the editor state
20:35:10 <shapr> yay, no more BEL (big editor lock)
20:35:27 <dons> just needs a few more threads to play with now :)
20:35:41 <shapr> threads are dirt cheap in Haskell, so we can have lots!
20:36:52 <dons> I guess one first thing would be to run the ui in another thread
20:37:01 <shapr> yah, I think so.
20:37:06 <dons> and forget about explicitly calling refresh.
20:37:11 * dons thinks about this
20:40:31 <wagle_> ping
20:40:38 <shapr> hiya wagle_
20:41:15 <wagle_> learning to use screen/irssi instead of xchat..  8/
20:41:33 <shapr> dons: oh, I found out that someone is using arrows to build editors with Clean on Win32.. so I'm not the first, or even the second to think of this.
20:41:51 <dons> interesting. ok, so we should really check this out
20:42:35 <wagle_> which was clean?
20:42:51 <shapr> which what? person? editor? language?
20:43:16 <wagle_> (the description of clean is in my head, but isn't answering retreival requests.. 8)
20:43:34 <shapr> oh, Clean is a lazy pure language that uses uniqueness types instead of monads.
20:43:42 <wagle_> ah yes
20:44:02 <shapr> seems heavily skewed towards win32, and last I checked does not have a sane license.
20:44:12 <wagle_> its particularly good for writing editors?
20:44:15 <shapr> though I have a mental tag that claims the license has been improved
20:44:29 <Pseudonym> LGPL now, I believe.
20:44:45 <shapr> Pseudonym: I thought it still had some restrictions on commercial use?
20:44:51 <shapr> wagle_: not any better than Haskell, imoh.
20:45:36 <Pseudonym> shapr: No.  You can get it under the LGPL or a commercial licence.
20:45:42 <shapr> oh
20:45:54 <Pseudonym> If you don't want to accept the LGPL you can fork out money.
20:46:17 <Pseudonym> You also don't get technical support under the LGPL.
20:46:50 <shapr> I tech support and a BSD license with GHC.
20:52:40 <vivek> shapr: GHC with a  BSD license ?
20:52:52 <Pseudonym> The libraries have a BSD licence.
20:53:02 <Pseudonym> The compiler doesn't need one, of course.
20:53:07 <shapr> ?
20:53:09 <vivek> dosnt that mean that i can resell my own GHC ?
20:53:19 <Pseudonym> You can resell your own GHC right now.
20:53:30 <vivek> <shapr> I tech support and a BSD license with GHC
20:53:42 <shapr> oh man, I'm dropping words
20:53:46 <shapr> must sleep :-)
20:53:59 <shapr> maybe I should finish and commit this refactoring first.
20:54:22 <vivek> I provide tech support maybe ...
20:54:35 <Pseudonym> -- drunk.. fix later
