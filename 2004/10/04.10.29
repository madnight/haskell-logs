01:49:19 <tromp> g'mornin
01:50:32 <Jan_w> hi tromp
01:50:42 <Jan_w> a very good morning
01:51:02 * Jan_w is hyped on coffee
02:20:28 <Boegel> hello everyone
02:20:44 <Jan_w> hi Boegel
02:22:06 <Boegel> hi Jan_w
02:22:14 <Boegel> are you new?
02:23:45 <Jan_w> Boegel: relatively
02:23:58 <Jan_w> Boegel: i've been here for 2 months or so
02:24:06 <Boegel> have you had shapr's tour ?
02:24:15 <Jan_w> Boegel: officially no :)
02:24:21 <Boegel> (I'm his promotor :p)
02:24:24 <Boegel> @seen shapr
02:24:25 <lambdabot> shapr is in #haskell, #darcs, #webwitches and #haskell.se.
02:24:39 * Boegel rings shapr's bell
02:24:56 <Jan_w> hehe
02:25:46 <Boegel> shapr has been idle 834 minutes
02:25:48 <Jan_w> Boegel: Oh, now that you mention it, I think I did have the tour :)
02:25:53 <Boegel> hmm, doesn't look good :)
02:26:14 <Jan_w> and i've seen others take it also :(
02:26:15 <Jan_w> :)
02:26:24 <Boegel> take what ?
02:26:32 <Jan_w> the tour
02:26:35 <Boegel> ow :)
02:26:42 <Jan_w> explanation about lambdabot etc..
02:26:58 <Jan_w> 1 thing I sometimes wonder: why in there no paste-page in the topic ?
02:27:00 <Boegel> we'll, you'll have to wait for shapr, I know a few things, but I wouldn't want to steal his thunder :)
02:28:03 <Jan_w> hehe
02:28:27 <Jan_w> no that the topic isn't big enough already :)
02:28:30 <Jan_w> +t
02:32:26 <Boegel> because you can get the url easily with lambdabot
02:32:34 <Boegel> @wiki HaskellIrcPastePage
02:32:34 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
02:33:16 <Jan_w> i wouldn't exacly call that easy :) but ok :)
02:33:44 <Jan_w> I ofter find myself writen recursive methodes like: http://rafb.net/paste/results/WFw0Ej19.html
02:33:55 <Jan_w> what bothers me in the foldr1's 
02:35:40 <Jan_w> is that seems a bit redundant to return a list and concat it to the rest of the results, alternatively i could pass a list of already found results forward ofcourse, is there a trick i'm missing here ?
02:36:50 <Boegel> in funct1, you can just give the list an one argument, you don't need to split it up...
02:36:51 <Jan_w> also, is there a way to make a list "global" so when a LOT of methods are involved, I don't have to pass it around every time ?
02:37:00 <Boegel> or is that just by eexample ?
02:37:09 <Jan_w> Boegel: just an example
02:37:22 <earthy> Jan_w: lists have an associated instance of monad
02:37:24 <earthy> that may help
02:37:55 <Jan_w> the word monad frightens me :)
02:38:00 <Boegel> Jan_w, I don't think so... you have to give that list as an argument
02:38:05 <Jan_w> i don't understand them yet, 
02:38:16 * Boegel still doesn't know what a monad is exactly...
02:38:25 <Jan_w> me neither
02:38:53 <Jan_w> earthy: could you give an example of a monad ?
02:39:12 <Boegel> IO is a monad, I know that
02:39:19 <Boegel> but why, beats me
02:40:07 <earthy> just a sec
02:41:16 <earthy> http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/MonadsAsContainers
02:42:14 <earthy> (the do-syntax example is nice)
02:43:55 <Boegel> I'll read that some time later, but thanks earthy, that will help me understand monads
02:46:16 <Jan_w> hm, reading
02:46:18 <Boegel> earthy, do you have a link for me on lhs ?
02:49:02 <Boegel> nevermind: http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/literate.html
02:49:17 <Boegel> I didn't know you could use a Haskell file as a LaTeX document :)
02:49:20 <Boegel> that's real cool
03:23:23 <earthy> and ofcourse, there's lhs2TeX which is a quite nice formatter for the haskell part of lhs files
03:24:00 <earthy> see http://www.cs.uu.nl/~andres/lhs2tex/
03:25:27 <Boegel> earthy: nice ! thanks !
03:32:30 <shapr> @yow !
03:32:30 <lambdabot> I'm an East Side TYPE..
03:32:54 <shapr> good morning #haskell !
03:33:39 <Matt-W> silly question
03:33:46 <Matt-W> but if I have an Int called a
03:33:48 <Matt-W> and I do 0.5 * a
03:33:58 <Matt-W> what function can I get that floors it and gives me an Int back?
03:39:13 <tromp> easier to just take a `div` 2
03:39:22 <tromp> @index div
03:39:23 <lambdabot> GHC.Real,Prelude
03:39:27 * shapr bounces
03:39:32 <shapr> wassup y'all?
03:39:34 <Matt-W> to
03:39:37 <Matt-W> doh!
03:39:38 <Boegel> hello shapr !
03:39:43 * Matt-W should've remembered div
03:40:14 <Matt-W> that's better
03:40:16 * Boegel didn't change anything on his code, and the shadows seem to work magicly :s
03:40:17 <tromp> morning, shapr
03:40:17 <Matt-W> compiles now :-)
03:40:43 <tromp> do ppl ever tell you your name is reminiscent to Sony Ericson?
03:40:59 <shapr> scary thought.
03:41:22 <tromp> what brand of mobile do you have?
03:41:41 <shapr> nokia 6310i
03:41:49 <Boegel> ow wait, nevermind :( it doesn't work...
03:43:22 <tromp> is RTFP an established acronym here yet:-?
03:43:35 <shapr> P?
03:43:40 <Boegel> Prelude ? :)
03:43:42 <tromp> prelude:)
03:43:43 <shapr> heh
03:44:00 <Boegel> *yaay* Boegel got it right , 1 point for Boegel
03:49:25 <Boegel> shapr, I think Jan_w wants a tour
03:49:30 <Boegel> if he's still here that is
03:49:47 <shapr> hm, I think I gave him the tour before...
03:49:56 <Boegel> he said you didn't :s
03:50:00 <shapr> oh
03:50:06 <tromp> when are you gonna write tourbot, shapr:-?
03:50:09 <shapr> haha
03:50:11 <shapr> good idea
03:50:25 <tromp> or can lambdabot take care of that?
03:50:41 <shapr> probably so
03:51:08 <tromp> helps you ward off RSI just that bit longer:)
03:51:32 <shapr> Already had RSI last year :-/
03:51:42 <tromp> welcome to the club!
03:51:58 <tromp> i had a bad case in 96-98
03:52:06 <shapr> I was only able to type with my right hand for several months.
03:52:25 <tromp> i had to avoid touching any keyboard for a month
03:52:31 <shapr> yow :-(
03:52:43 <tromp> a colleague had it worse
03:52:44 <shapr> there must be something wrong with an input system that damages its users.
03:52:50 <tromp> cldn't hold a spoon
03:53:49 <tromp> most of it is bad posture, bad typing skills, and lack of breaks
03:53:58 <Boegel> how do I state that a variable has to be different from a certain value ?
03:54:07 <Boegel> I tried the != syntax, but that doesn't work...
03:54:23 <tromp> pls elaborate
03:54:45 <shapr> I think RSI is more about *static* posture.
03:55:04 <shapr> human bodies are not designed to be in the same posture for months
03:55:10 <Boegel> it's for stating it in a condition, like you would do (x == 0) to check is x is equal to 0
03:55:18 <Boegel> I want to check it x is different from 0
03:55:31 <tromp> how does x != 0 not work?
03:55:34 <Boegel> shapr: sometimes my back is killing me
03:55:52 <tromp> try sitting on an exercise ball
03:55:53 <Boegel> that's why I have a 'sitting ball' instead of a chair
03:56:00 <Boegel> tromp: :o)
03:56:00 <tromp> :-P
03:56:06 <shapr> my solution is to use a couch instead of chair.
03:56:13 <shapr> then I can lie down and type
03:56:30 <Boegel> my girlfriend is (how do you say this, someone who helps people with back problems, help to recover after accidents and such)
03:56:48 <tromp> physical therapist
03:56:57 <shapr> massage? chiropractor?
03:56:58 <mattam> recovery assistant ?
03:57:03 <Boegel> tromp: GHCI tells me 'Variable not in scope: '!='
03:57:14 <tromp> pls give the context
03:57:14 <shapr> what about /= ?
03:57:17 <Boegel> tromp, yeah something like that
03:57:22 <mattam> /=
03:57:36 <Boegel> that's it, shapr and mattam, thx !
03:57:45 <Boegel> why doesn't Haskell use != ?
03:57:59 <shapr> why doesn't C use /= ?
03:58:15 <tromp> tromp feels silly about forgetting /= :(
03:58:16 <mattam> is not 'not' in haskell
03:58:23 <mattam> / is not 'not' in haskell
03:58:39 <mattam> but ! is in C, that's more sensible
03:58:40 <Boegel> tromp: I use it in a funct | (cond1) = value1 (cond2) = value2    notation
03:58:42 <shapr> @index not
03:58:42 <lambdabot> Data.Bool,GHC.Base,Prelude
03:58:50 <shapr> @type Prelude.not
03:58:51 <lambdabot> Prelude.not :: Bool -> Bool
03:59:01 <tromp> i wrote some decent sized programs that don't have a single /= in them
03:59:44 <Boegel> tromp: I'm just trying to figure out why my freakin' shadows won't work :)
03:59:50 <mattam> shapr: so ?
03:59:52 <Boegel> I'm overlooking something, but don't know what
04:00:11 <tromp> doing graphics?
04:00:39 <Boegel> tromp: ray tracing :) don't you know ?
04:00:48 <shapr> mattam: er, what?
04:00:57 <tromp> either that, or i forgot
04:00:58 * shapr is confused
04:01:02 <shapr> as usual...
04:01:21 <Boegel> tromp: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic/website/
04:01:51 <mattam> i don't understand why you bringed 'not' before our eyes
04:02:31 <Boegel> anyway, I'll think I'll go see my promotor... I should show my progress anyway
04:02:40 <shapr> mattam: because I was confused about what you were saying, but later I understood what you were saying.
04:02:51 <Boegel> 'cause I have made a lot of progress since I met him :)
04:02:51 <mattam> ok ;)
04:04:21 <Boegel> tromp: how do you like it ?
04:07:39 <u1sf> how come with the latest version of GHC CVS I can't declare data Something a = Something String?
04:08:05 <u1sf> i.e. I quantify something on the LHS but don't use it on the RHS?
04:08:29 <u1sf> forget that
04:08:52 <u1sf> something else weird is happening:
04:09:19 <u1sf> data PropName a = PropName Int String
04:09:30 <u1sf>     Couldn't match kind `*' against `k_a5eP -> *'
04:09:30 <u1sf>     In the data type declaration for `PropName'
04:10:28 <Si\> interesting, it seems it can't cope with me having the same Cons name as Type name
04:12:10 <Si\> no that's not it either...
04:13:25 <Boegel> tromp ? are you hypnotized by my images ? :)
04:13:38 <Boegel> eer: z or s in hypnoti*ed ?
04:14:24 <Boegel> this is _really_ weird: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic/website/weird3.png
04:14:45 <Boegel> (one point light in between the small spheres, and a plane behind it all)
04:14:50 <shapr> Boegel: POKEMON!
04:14:56 <Boegel> shapr: nah :p
04:15:00 * shapr cackles evilly
04:15:10 <shapr> ok, time for my morning stimulants...
04:15:14 <Boegel> shapr: you want to see the pokemon scene with this implementation ?
04:15:18 <shapr> YES!
04:19:57 <tromp> sorry, boegel, was afh (away from haskell)
04:20:09 <shapr> :-)
04:20:54 <tromp> no , u'll have to try harder to get me hypnotized:(
04:21:26 <Boegel> shapr: http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic/website/weird4.png
04:21:38 <Boegel> tromp: how do you like the images so far ?
04:22:08 <shapr> w00! cosmic pokemon!
04:22:19 <shapr> looks like a planetary system in midstride.
04:22:23 <tromp> i like http://studwww.ugent.be/~kehoste/thesisPublic/website/23_10_2004/2.png best
04:22:30 <tromp> nice and colorful
04:23:01 <Boegel> idd, and it will improve once I've implemented specular reflection
04:23:18 <Boegel> but anyway, I'll go see if my promotor can help me with the shadow problem :)
04:23:21 <Boegel> bye everyone !
04:23:27 <tromp> cul8r
04:23:27 <shapr> cya Boegel 
04:23:46 <shapr> hei kig 
04:24:09 <shapr> so, a bit of work to do today, and then... time to hack on either yi or Fermat's Last Margin.
04:24:27 <shapr> My woman is in Lille for four days, so it's time for a CODE BINGE!
04:24:55 * Philippa_ would be spending time with other folks in the area instead, but hey ;-)
04:25:12 <shapr> what? if you were home alone you'd go out and talk to people?
04:25:22 <shapr> freaky...
04:25:25 <Philippa_> er... yeah, to start with :-)
04:27:42 <tromp> you can combine the two, join other ppl in the area for a CODE BINGE!
04:30:12 <dons> shapr: hack yi, yeah!
04:30:40 <dons> Philippa_: make way=static should hopefully build yi-static on windows..
04:33:33 <Philippa_> dons: cool
04:34:16 * Philippa_ will grab later today - gotta get ready for an appointment soon
04:34:28 <shapr> tromp: I don't know any programmers in the area :-(
04:34:34 <shapr> well, some PHP guys
04:34:43 <dons> oh no!
04:34:44 <shapr> and few, um,  "html programmers" 
04:34:47 <Philippa_> convert them to WASH or Network.CGI + the IO monad?
04:34:52 <shapr> that's what they call themselves.
04:35:21 <shapr> I actually know some PHP guys who took Haskell classes, but they get all green in the face when I even mention recursion.
04:38:43 <earthy> but, recursion is scary, you know that, right...
04:39:00 <Philippa_> it is if you haven't been shown any of the common patterns
04:39:09 <Philippa_> and if you have, they should be HOFs ;-)
04:39:36 <earthy> recursion is simple enough for me to have taught my little sister... back when she was like 8.
04:39:49 <shapr> the PHP culture doesn't encourage recursion
04:40:14 * earthy gets all green in the face at the thought of having to use PHP
04:40:14 <arjanb> recursion is evil in unpure languages
04:40:35 <earthy> what do you mean with `unpure'?
04:41:11 <arjanb> mutable state and such
04:41:34 <earthy> so, recursion is evil in (say) ML?
04:47:19 <shapr> hiya mornfall 
04:47:34 <mornfall> hey hey, shapr 
04:47:37 <shapr> how's code?
04:47:58 <mornfall> shapr: code is stall, but i possibly have first bonus point in haskell classes ;)
04:48:04 <mornfall> (there are total of 2 in whole class...)
04:48:15 * mornfall goes checking
04:49:39 <Philippa_> earthy: if you're in here, odds are your sister's not dumb either
04:49:50 * shapr grins
04:49:59 <shapr> mornfall: how'd you get a bonus point?
04:50:00 <mornfall> hmm, not yet... maybe it's not yet registered tho (hopefully)
04:50:19 <shapr> Guten tag TheHunter
04:50:32 <mornfall> shapr: by "evaluating" a a a, where a = f . f . f =)
04:50:43 <TheHunter> Hi shapr
04:51:18 <mornfall> shapr: the other exercise was proving recursion via induction (i wasn't first one to solve that... stupid me)
04:51:50 <shapr> hm, a class with lots of bonus points would really appeal to me.
04:52:04 <shapr> boring stuff sucks, but contests are fun.
04:52:22 <mornfall> well, we only managed 2 contests in last 3 classes, so that kinda sucks
04:52:26 <shapr> eek, today is the last day to send in HC&AR submissions!
04:52:29 <mornfall> but that's because we are generally slow
04:52:39 <tromp> did you try the IFPC contest, shapr?
04:53:05 * mornfall spins some metal
04:53:09 <shapr> you mean the ICFP contest?
04:53:18 <tromp> oops, yes
04:53:18 <shapr> mornfall: hey, some good metal on magnatune.com
04:53:27 <shapr> I like seismic anomaly
04:53:59 <kosmikus> tuomov: do you want to write something about riot for the HCAR?
04:54:01 <shapr> I was busy doing EuroPython and EuroHaskell during the last ICFP
04:54:38 <Philippa_> shapr: crap, remind me when I get back
04:54:45 <mornfall> shapr: streaming only?
04:55:23 <shapr> mornfall: well, stream it, download it, whatever. He doesn't care. But if you like it, buy it!
04:55:42 <mornfall> shapr: i'd love to... i need a job first tho
04:56:18 <dons> shapr: I sent in a yi hcar entry
04:56:22 <shapr> magnatune.com mp3s are free, but the CD quality versions are commercial.
04:56:23 <shapr> dons: excellent
04:56:33 <dons> so you don't have to write one ;)
04:56:42 <shapr> good to hear :-)
04:56:55 <shapr> I have... many to write.
04:57:13 <mornfall> now playing (amaroK): In Flames - Borders and Shading (0:52 / 4:22)
04:57:13 <dons> I noticed that when i read the topics page, so I thought it was my duty
04:57:23 <shapr> heh, fine with me :-)
04:57:42 <shapr> but I would still write up yi if you didn't have time, or preferred to put in code.
04:57:51 <dons> btw, you should play with the new window splitting code. lots of fun
04:58:06 <dons> :sp splits the screen to give you separate windows onto buffers
04:58:11 <dons> ^W shifts focus
04:58:20 <dons> :e pulls in new files into a window
04:58:29 <dons> um, :n :p rotate through buffer list
04:58:42 <tuomov> kosmikus: I don't know.. maybe part of the about text from the riot homepage might suffice?
04:58:42 <dons> :q closes windows
04:59:43 <tuomov> and how does one submit entries?
05:00:34 <dons> tuomov: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2004-October/014705.html
05:00:48 <dons> that was the recent instructions
05:00:53 <Si\> what's the difference in TH between mkName and newName (apart from one is in Q)?
05:01:01 <dons> so you just email hcar at haskell.org
05:05:35 <kosmikus> tuomov: sure, you decide the content -- a short statement would be enough
05:05:45 <earthy> `It exists' :P
05:05:49 <kosmikus> tuomov: could you send it to hcar at haskell dot org, please?
05:06:08 <kosmikus> oh sorry, didn't read dons statement
05:06:16 * kosmikus is away
05:06:16 <earthy> (nah, a bit more than `it exists would be nice)
05:06:44 <dons> "riot is great, and has a cool configure system" :)
05:06:53 <Philippa_> stuff it, report written
05:06:57 <Philippa_> now I better go shower...
05:07:27 <tuomov> done.
05:09:51 <tuomov> I should get around to finally making a few more improvements and making a new release of riot
05:10:01 <tuomov> (and same applies to ion)
05:10:13 <tuomov> but I've been too "busy" thinking other things
05:10:22 <tuomov> (and getting nowhere)
05:10:52 <dons> hehe
05:11:31 <tuomov> trying to decide what to do with the rest of your life is not fun..
05:12:29 <dons> argh.
05:13:12 <bourbaki> moin
05:16:33 <dons> night all
05:16:41 <bourbaki> nighto
05:20:06 <xkb> ola
05:30:32 <Si\> Can I use TH to scope a number of TH splices; i.e. I begin with $(beginOperation x) and then all the following TH statements can get hold of x (without explicitly passing it)?
05:46:21 <peti> Guten Tag. 
05:46:37 * edwinb writes GHC Core
05:46:40 <edwinb> this is scarily fun
05:46:52 <Lemmih> G'day peti.
05:47:56 <shapr> g'night dons 
05:47:59 <Si\> or can you get it to automatically reify the previous declaration (whatever it is) without specifying a name?
05:49:15 <shapr> y0 peti 
05:49:43 <peti> shapr: Yo! ;-)
05:49:48 * shapr grins
05:52:30 <shapr> today is the last day for HC&AR submissions!
05:52:37 <peti> Theoretically. :-)
05:52:40 <bourbaki> moin shammah
05:52:43 <bourbaki> er shapr
05:52:55 <shapr> edwinb: are you going to write up epigram?
05:53:08 <edwinb> Er, write up in what sense?
05:53:08 <Si\> shapr: don't suppose you know if TH can automatically see the declaration previous to it?
05:53:24 <shapr> I do not know, sadly.
05:53:35 <shapr> but you could ask on the list.
05:53:42 <shapr> SPJ usually responds in less than 24 hours.
05:53:57 <shapr> edwinb: write up epigram as an application/use of Haskell.
05:54:13 <shapr> or did you already and I just don't know about it?
05:55:35 <edwinb> Oh, right. Yes, we probably should.
05:55:42 <shapr> today is the last day for submissions!
05:56:13 <shapr> Hm, I have only six things on my list of HC&AR items. I must be forgetting some.
05:56:19 <edwinb> Bah! I guess we're too late then.
05:56:25 <edwinb> We'll have to get it in next time.
05:56:39 <shapr> edwinb: otherwise I'll write up epigram, and you never know what I might say ;-)
05:56:45 <edwinb> heh
05:56:57 <shapr> a short summary paragraph and urls to the mailing list and webpage would be enough.
05:57:23 <edwinb> Yes, but I'd have to do it in the next ten minutes and everyone else has another excuse.
05:57:42 <shapr> for example, you should mention that epigram allows typechecking of behaviour much more so than the HM typesystem.
05:58:05 <shapr> it won't take more than five minutes, I'm sure ;-)
05:58:18 <edwinb> We're having a "Workers Hackshop" this weekend in Nottingham so we're off after we all get out of our various committments this afternoon...
05:58:26 <shapr> good name!
05:58:54 <edwinb> Indeed. I wonder if we'll achieve anything.
05:59:41 <shapr> well, use quickcheck, hunit, and darcs... and order pizza twice a day.
05:59:47 <shapr> oh, and lots of whiteboards.
06:00:05 <edwinb> I expect it'll degenerate into arguing over beer.
06:01:01 <shapr> Well, next time at EuroHaskell, I won't give the Haskell/monads tutorial in the same room with the productive coding people. That much I have learned.
06:01:31 <shapr> The moral I learned at EuroHaskell 2004 - "If someone is getting stuff done, get out of their way."
06:01:34 <edwinb> This meeting is more about getting Conor to stop doing it all himself.
06:01:44 <edwinb> Kind of a work division effort.
06:02:02 <edwinb> Yes, good moral.
06:02:43 <shapr> In that case, you guys should probably each pick a chunk of epigram, and look for small bugs to fix. In the process of fixing them, you'll be able to siphon knowledge (and hopefully responsibility) off of Conor.
06:02:56 <edwinb> There aren't any small bugs. Just massive ones. ;)
06:03:02 <shapr> at least, that's my suggestion I give with no actual knowledge of the situation ...
06:03:20 <edwinb> Anyway, time to go and pretend I know Java at some undergraduates.
06:03:26 <shapr> haha
06:03:32 <shapr> shall I write up epigram for HC&AR?
06:03:35 <shapr> would that be okay with you?
06:04:02 <edwinb> Erm. *I* wouldn't mind, certainly, but I'm not sure I should speak for the rest of the group...
06:04:22 <shapr> well, if no one else is going to do it...
06:04:42 <edwinb> Indeed. You could always take the approach of doing it and seeing who complains ;)
06:04:46 <shapr> you could ask kosmikus|away if he'll let you submit it tomorrow..
06:04:50 <shapr> ah yes, lazy complaint evaluation.
06:05:04 <edwinb> Ah, good point. Then we can knock something up in the pub tonight.
06:05:15 <shapr> right, instead of arguing about beer.
06:05:34 <edwinb> Oh we won't be arguing *about* beer, we'll be arguing about type theory while drinking beer...
06:05:44 <shapr> oh, wish I could show up
06:05:47 <shapr> sounds like a blast
06:06:10 <shapr> I keep trying to argue arrows versus monads at the local swedish pub, but no one is interested in either viewpoint.
06:06:18 <edwinb> Shame!
06:06:42 * shapr looks at the previous HC&AR for writing inspiration
06:13:33 <tuomov> I don't even know anyone around here interested in fp. Everyone I know sees it as academic wanking.
06:15:18 <tuomov> So the only argument is fp vs. imperative
06:15:26 <shapr> My approach is that I can't make a judgement about anything I don't understand
06:15:54 <shapr> So, recently someone told me that Forth is really cool and elegant, so I left myself a thunk in my mental concept map so that one day I'll go see if they're right.
06:16:03 <tuomov> One of my friends started reading on ml or something, but got disgusted with recursive data types..
06:16:37 <shapr> I think Occam's Razor applies to bug-free coding as much as to philosophy.
06:17:20 <shapr> Not only is the simplest explanation usually the correct explanation, but also the simplest solution usually has the least bugs.
06:17:52 <shapr> therefore, any language that makes me use a loop instead of map gives me more opportunities to put in bugs instead of code.
06:19:27 <shapr> So, it's not that procedural programming is necessarily inferior or superior. It's just that in its current incarnation, it's more manual and harder than FP.
06:19:50 <shapr> And I don't like to do more work than is actually required for to solve a problem.
06:20:05 <shapr> I'd rather focus on the essential difficulties of a problem rather than the accidental difficulties.
06:20:21 <tuomov> I like the more "mathy" approach of fp..
06:20:51 <shapr> I like the simpler easier approach to problem solving of fp.
06:20:56 <shapr> Maybe those are the same thing =)
06:43:47 <shapr> Any HC&AR entries that might have been forgotten?
06:44:01 <shapr> Can anyone think of anything?
06:47:11 <Lemmih> Should I mention something about Hackage?
06:47:12 <bourbaki> what entries are there yet?
06:47:24 <bourbaki> where is the conf anyway?
06:47:52 <shapr> Lemmih: yes!
06:48:29 <shapr> bourbaki: it's the bi-yearly inofficial report of Haskell activity.
06:48:41 <shapr> if you're writing something fun in Haskell, send in an entry!
06:49:03 <bourbaki> shapr so its not a physical meeting?
06:49:14 <shapr> nope
06:49:42 <bourbaki> ah ok well i might do for the next one maybe
06:51:23 <shapr> ya know, something like sourceforge on haskell.org would be nice.
06:52:06 <bourbaki> oh thats a good diea
06:52:07 <bourbaki> ide
06:52:08 <bourbaki> a
06:57:05 <shapr> Philippa_: hey, you going to write up Flippi for HC&AR?

07:10:40 <shapr> Man, this slashdot article on wikis is amazing. I thought only usenet could gather together that many comments with such a small percentage of clue about the subject being discussed.
07:11:20 <earthy> /. is almost as good as usenet at that :)
07:11:35 <shapr> For wikis, it's obviously far better.
07:11:54 <shapr> someone said that changing wiki versions might give a difficult upgrade path.
07:12:45 <shapr> if your wiki syntax changes drastically, thirty seconds with sed will upgrade the text of all of your pages.
07:12:48 <shapr> how hard is that?
07:13:27 <tuomov> slashdot - the meeting place of the clueless
07:13:34 <dblhelix> @yow
07:13:35 <lambdabot> I guess you guys got BIG MUSCLES from doing too much STUDYING!
07:13:40 <shapr> or check this out, they're talking about misinformation on wikis, that maybe they should hire people to keep wikis truthful.
07:14:13 <dblhelix> entering in the middle of something here?
07:14:29 <shapr> sorry, I'm flaming the slashdot crowd.
07:14:46 <shapr> they're talking about wikis, and pretending they have a clue about how it all works.
07:14:59 <bourbaki> @arr
07:14:59 <lambdabot> Aye Aye Cap'n
07:15:00 <dblhelix> oh, go on ... I'll just read and agree with you
07:15:13 <shapr> oh man, they're saying you can't tag a document with categories!
07:15:29 <shapr> They are so lost it's amazing.
07:16:55 <dblhelix> I stopped reading slashdot when I realized that they suffered from a major trade-off: the one between quality and quantity of postings ... 
07:17:47 <shapr> oh here's a good one "wikis will never catch on"
07:18:35 <tuomov> there's usually better comments in the articles that don't appear on the main page..
07:19:19 <shapr> The amount of totally and obviously wrong information in these comments is amazing.
07:19:37 <shapr> I can't read to the end, the stupidity is affecting my brain.
07:21:30 <shapr> is there a good way to do "darcs mv * ../" ?
07:22:45 <tuomov> map!
07:23:16 <shapr> speaking of which, a ghci cmdline darcs prompt would rock
07:23:32 <tuomov> shouldn't be too much of a problem to write map for sh..
07:23:57 <shapr> map f x = for x in foo; do f $x; done;
07:24:10 <shapr> umm
07:24:19 <tuomov> map "darcs mv {} ../" files...
07:24:34 <tuomov> but you have to be careful with escaping when replacing {}
07:25:05 <shapr> oh hey, darcs mv * ../ actually works
07:26:16 <tromp> mayby flippi shld be mentioned on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software
07:27:27 <mento> hi
07:28:23 <shapr> hej mento 
07:28:30 <mento> hej
07:32:32 <shapr> wazzup?
07:33:05 <mento> nuthn
07:34:13 <Philippa_> tromp: feel free to do it for me
07:35:28 <Philippa> I'm quite happy for other people to advertise Flippi on other wikis so long as they're not doing anything impolite
07:36:37 <tromp> i'll leave the honor to you. i'm not that fluent in wiki
07:36:49 <Philippa> me either :-)
07:37:12 <shapr> Philippa: y0, are you going to write up flippi for HC&AR?
07:37:18 <tromp> when i edited the Go pages, people had to come in after me to fix up:(
07:37:27 <Philippa> shapr: did it earlier
07:38:18 <tromp> wikipedia also doesn't know about hawiki
07:38:24 <shapr> ah, ok
07:38:40 <tromp> what engine runs hawiki?
07:38:40 <shapr> mento: john hughes wrote some cool pretty printers, that's probably what I would look at first.
07:38:46 <shapr> it's running MoinMoin
07:39:00 <tromp> based on what language is that?
07:39:03 <shapr> Python
07:39:19 <shapr> I'd be happy to switch to Flippi if/when it reaches the same featureness.
07:39:32 <tromp> ah yes, i notice now at the bottom
07:40:01 <tromp> the real goal is to get the PyWiki running on a haskell engine:)
07:41:21 * shapr snickers
07:43:37 <mento> can anyone comprehend/explain the second sentence given in this assignment please.
07:43:38 <mento> Write the function pp :: Prop -> String that implements a pretty-printer for your data-type. Furthermore, think of a relation that should hold between pretty-printing and parsing,  write  the function  checkPp :: Prop -> Bool that for a specific value in your Prop data-type checks whether this relation is met. 
07:44:02 <mento> I cant get it what I'm supposed to do :(
07:44:15 <shapr> mento: what's the relationship between multiplication and division?
07:44:32 <mento> I'm tiered
07:44:35 <mento> I dont know
07:44:42 <Philippa> mento: think of equations you can write involving pretty-print and parse functions that might make sense
07:45:02 <tuomov> maybe it would make more sense if checkPP :: Prop -> String -> Bool?
07:45:05 <shapr> I'm tiered, but at least I'm near the top!
07:46:30 <mento> I'm sorry guys. I dont get either of you :(:(
07:46:55 <shapr> mento: what's the relationship between addition and subtraction?
07:47:13 <shapr> how could you check your addition steps with subtraction?
07:47:34 <mento> priority?
07:47:45 <shapr> huh?
07:48:18 <mento> + and - have the same priority than * and /
07:48:59 <shapr> if were balancing my checkbook, and I had (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) how could I use subtraction to check my final result against the inputs?
07:49:28 <mento> 3-1-1-1=0
07:49:34 <shapr> that's correct.
07:49:42 <shapr> so, what's the relationship of addition and subtraction?
07:49:51 <mento> the = sign ?
07:49:59 <mento> aaaaaaaa
07:50:04 <shapr> addition is the  ___ of subtraction...
07:50:12 <shapr> what word is missing?
07:50:14 <mento> opposite :D
07:50:25 <shapr> ok, now, what's the relationship of multiplication and division?
07:50:51 <mento> same there ?
07:50:56 <shapr> looks like it to me.
07:51:01 <mento> sheesh
07:51:02 <mento> :D
07:51:07 <shapr> so, what's the relationship of parsing and pretty-printing?
07:51:11 <bourbaki> substraction is not existent
07:51:22 <bourbaki> its just the addition of the inverse elements :)
07:51:36 <mento> parsing is opposite of pretty-printing
07:51:40 <shapr> bourbaki: have you heard of 'fables for teaching' ?  ;-)
07:51:42 <mento> I think I get it :DDDDD
07:51:46 <shapr> mento: shocking, isn't it?
07:51:58 <bourbaki> a - b is just the shortform of  a + (-b)
07:52:06 <shapr> mento: now, how would you write code to check your pretty-printer against your parser?
07:52:09 <bourbaki> as my math prof said in the first five minutes
07:52:25 <mento> I just couldnt get the sentence and it was so easy. Thank you!
07:52:27 <bourbaki> "forget everything you have learned so far about math we start from the beginning" :)
07:52:48 <shapr> mento: btw, the english word is "inverse" I think
07:53:10 <tromp> f^{-1} . f = id
07:53:11 <mento> I'd pretty-print then parse and check the equality.
07:53:16 <shapr> mento: tada!
07:53:19 <shapr> you get the gold star.
07:53:34 <mento> you're a good man. Thx.
07:53:35 <mento> Later
07:53:45 <shapr> John Hughes is a great teacher ;-)
07:53:57 <bourbaki> who was that again?
07:54:22 <shapr> John Hughes is a cool guy at chalmers.
07:54:34 <shapr> Very likely the guy teaching mento's class :-)
07:54:37 <bourbaki> who did what?
07:55:50 <shapr> John has done pretty-printers, arrows, global vars, quickcheck, and other useful stuff.
07:56:13 * shapr should start a Haskell HR index.
07:56:37 <bourbaki> global vars?
07:56:39 <mento> I didnt have John :( I had Write the function pp :: Prop -> String that implements a pretty-printer for your data-type. Furthermore, think of a relation that should hold between pretty-printing and parsing,  write  the function  checkPp :: Prop -> Bool that for a specific value in your Prop data-type checks whether this relation is met. 
07:56:42 <mento> sorry
07:56:55 <mento> Jan-Willem Roorda
07:56:57 <shapr> mento: john isn't teaching your class?
07:56:59 <shapr> ohh
07:57:11 <shapr> I've heard of him, but I don't know much about him.
07:57:39 <shapr> Sounds like Koen has the chance to speak Dutch again now :-)
07:58:11 <mento> I dont know what to say. I went to his class twice or so. Couldnt comprehend much of what he said/ment.¨
07:59:02 <shapr> functional programming is very different from procedural programming, but the useful patterns in FP are applicable to Java, C++, etc.
07:59:33 <Philippa> mento: did you go to the first class?
07:59:33 <shapr> Is the pretty-printer part of a Haskell intro?
07:59:39 <mento> yes
07:59:49 <Philippa> 'k - sorry for the obQ then
08:00:17 <shapr> Going to Haskell from a Java/C/C++ background will require some work, but will be very much worth it.
08:00:28 * peti thinks that FP per se is not so different from C or C++.
08:00:42 <shapr> peti: and I think monads aren't so different from OOP.
08:00:50 <shapr> but I've had trouble convincing some people ;-)
08:01:08 <peti> shapr: The basics are different, yes. But once you have the monad, the code you write is almost identical to a C++ class with private members.
08:01:15 <bourbaki> how do you do global vars in haskell?
08:01:28 <shapr> bourbaki: ah, you'll have to read John's paper :-)
08:01:42 <peti> bourbaki: You don't. :-) You simulate the concept with unsafePerformIO. 
08:01:49 <Philippa> shapr: Arrows *are* OOP
08:01:56 <Philippa> you're wiring objects together
08:02:03 <shapr> Philippa: try to convince a Smalltalker of that... or a Java programmer.
08:02:09 <Philippa> :-)
08:02:26 <Philippa> a Smalltalker might be convinced of it by way of "an arrow type is a metaclass"
08:02:40 <shapr> I hate cleaning brains off the wall after explaining monads/arrows to the average procedural programmer.
08:02:49 <bourbaki> i think arrows arent the same as oop in c++
08:02:57 <Philippa> well no
08:03:02 <Philippa> OOP isn't the same as OOP in C++ ;-)
08:03:08 <bourbaki> right
08:03:23 <bourbaki> oop in c++ seems strange to me nowadays
08:03:33 <peti> I think the most significant difference are higher-order functions.
08:03:33 <TheHunter> Existentials are OOP. But arrows?
08:03:43 <Philippa> shapr: I can do it if they're smart and if they can swallow an explanation of what "semantics" means
08:03:53 <peti> You can do something like map (or mapM!) in C/C++, but it's awkward. 
08:04:12 <shapr> see I think every C function has an implicit IO in the type sig.
08:04:16 <Philippa> TheHunter: are all about connecting together objects (the basic combinators, black boxes created with pure, things you've built up of components)
08:04:30 <Philippa> shapr: more an implicit BrokenCSemantics, but hey
08:04:36 <shapr> heheh
08:05:08 <Philippa> TheHunter: with the right arrow type it's entirely possible for those black boxes to carry their own state
08:05:32 <Philippa> hence the idea that arrow types are metaclasses (only more so, IMO)
08:05:58 <TheHunter> hmm
08:06:53 <shapr> heh, cute signoff.
08:06:57 <shapr> greetings creichen 
08:09:42 <TheHunter> Philippa, ok, i have a vague idea what you mean. You can model the part of OO that deals with encapsulating state as arrows.
08:10:02 <TheHunter> But you don't get the same interface - different implementation part.
08:12:04 <shapr> hiya dottedmag 
08:12:27 <dottedmag> shapr: hi
08:15:14 <shapr> how's code?
08:15:39 <xerox> ,yow!
08:15:45 <xerox> *g*
08:15:55 <shapr> I think that only works on #emacs :-P
08:19:39 <bourbaki> Philippa how do you want to store data in a metaobject build by arrows?
08:24:38 <Philippa> TheHunter: right, you get semantics but not syntax
08:25:39 <Philippa> bourbaki: it's just the arrow equivalent of an STRef
08:26:09 <Philippa> or if you want immutable objects, it's just passing data around w/existentials
08:27:37 <bourbaki> stref does what?
08:27:58 <Philippa> er, it's an IORef only attached to a different state thread. Mutable storage.
08:29:33 <bourbaki> aha ok
08:31:16 <creichen> shapr: Hi!
08:31:35 <Philippa> bourbaki: on one level what I'm saying here is utterly shallow and I know it
08:31:49 <bourbaki> well i thought about that also alot
08:31:51 <Philippa> on another I sorta see it as an indication that arrows "do the right thing"
08:31:53 <bourbaki> cause i need that for my thesis
08:36:39 <Philippa> view the ST monad (or possibly IO to avoid the rank-2 irritations) as an ArrowApply then build transformers on top of it?
08:37:48 <bourbaki> i still dont understand the use of arrowapply really since it doesnt yield anything
08:42:29 <Philippa> it just says that something that fits the monadic signiature is an arrow as well, in that regard
08:43:04 <Philippa> but if you're ignoring monads and just looking at arrows, it provides a way to tell when you can't guarantee a degree of static info (because the structure will self-modify and thus isn't static)
08:50:23 <bourbaki> Philippa can you elaborate on the last part and the apply?
08:52:20 <bourbaki> i thought apply was something like the dual pairing where you assign a value to a function
09:04:48 <Philippa> bourbaki: apply is just "function" application as per normal, regardless of which way round the pair's written
09:07:09 <bourbaki> Philippa but it doenst yield a value does it?
09:07:47 <Philippa> I'll just double check, but I believe you get a value on the apply's output
09:07:53 <Philippa> (yay for lack of terminology!)
09:08:33 <bourbaki> :)
09:08:48 <bourbaki> well the output of a function is not in the function space right?
09:09:02 * Philippa blinks
09:09:46 <bourbaki> well i mean its not of the type a -> b
09:10:03 <Philippa> yeah
09:11:27 <bourbaki> then that apply cant give you a result other then another function right?
09:11:49 <Philippa> if you'll excuse the potential errors, (id &&& somefunc >>> apply) ~= somefunc if I've understood things correctly and not got the order of apply's parms wrong
09:12:17 <Philippa> app rather than apply
09:12:40 <Philippa> and yeah, it wants somefunc as the first item in the pair rather than the second
09:13:14 <Philippa> so (idA &&& (pure somefunc)) >>> app ~= somefunc - the ~= because I can't remember if there're possible side-effects
09:13:22 <Philippa> *argh*
09:13:29 <Philippa> ((pure somefunc) &&& idA) :-)
09:13:38 <Philippa> that making sense, rambling aside?
09:13:56 <bourbaki> hm i thought the type of app was something like
09:14:42 <bourbaki> er what type was it again :)
09:15:00 <Philippa> app :: a (a b c, b) c
09:15:01 <bourbaki> it was something like the function and a value of the same type as the domain
09:15:06 <bourbaki> ah right
09:15:39 <bourbaki> and &&& was of what type?
09:15:42 <Philippa> yeah. Which is why the above equation - if you make a pair of the input and somefunc then pass it to app, you should get the equivalent of just running the input into somefunc
09:15:56 <Philippa> it's the "build a pair" one - takes one input, runs the corresponding arrow on both
09:16:02 <Philippa> that pure should be a returnA, my bad
09:16:17 <bourbaki> ah right
09:16:21 <Philippa> I've spent too long playing with arrow-like frameworks and not long enough writing arrow code
09:16:56 <bourbaki> and why does app just pass the input to the first fn?
09:17:17 <bourbaki> (idA &&& (pure somefunc)) isnt this the function then the value is applied to?
09:17:46 <Philippa> yeah, idA yields the original input, returnA somefunc yields somefunc within the arrow
09:17:54 <Philippa> so we're pairing the existing input and somefunc up
09:18:09 <Philippa> and then putting that pair into app
09:18:15 <bourbaki> ok but the idea of app is still to apply a value to the function isnt it?
09:18:37 <Philippa> yeah
09:18:45 <Philippa> or the function to the value even, but yeah
09:19:35 <bourbaki> but it cant give you a result in the function space so what is it good for?
09:20:24 <bourbaki> i just switch to the usual function then to apply a value with erup
09:24:24 <Philippa> bourbaki: it's not supposed to give you a result outside the arrow, it's supposed to give the possibility of writing higher-order functions within the arrow
09:25:02 <bourbaki> Philippa you are talking about partial application right?
09:25:28 <Philippa> no, I'm talking about not being able to write something like MapM for general arrows
09:25:31 <Philippa> sorry, mapM
09:26:12 <Philippa> mapA can only be written for ArrowApply
09:26:28 <bourbaki> mapM does what? :)
09:26:45 <Philippa> it's like map, only it runs monadic code over a list
09:27:14 <Philippa> eg mapM (hGetContents) filenames
09:27:28 <peti> Could someone with a GHCi handy please try this: getUserEntryForName [] >>= print . userName
09:27:47 <peti> On my system, I don't get the promised exception, I get the last entry from /etc/passwd.
09:27:59 <Philippa> which libs do I need in scope?
09:28:29 <Philippa> and is the . userName irrelevant?
09:28:31 <peti> Philippa: System.Posix.User -- you need Unix, for that though.
09:28:37 <Philippa> ah
09:28:44 <Philippa> you should've said, I may be a little useless :-)
09:28:51 <peti> Philippa: The User record doesn't have 'Show' defined, so I need to access a field in it.
09:28:54 <bourbaki> Philippa windoze :)?
09:28:56 <Philippa> fair enough
09:28:58 <Philippa> bourbaki: bingo
09:29:02 <bourbaki> heh
09:29:05 <Philippa> what can I say? I'm a gamer
09:29:20 <bourbaki> yeah what games do you play?
09:29:30 <Philippa> er, not masses atm, a bit of Dawn of War online atm
09:29:42 <bourbaki> ah yeah i tested it on the open beta
09:29:49 <Philippa> used to play things like UT and camperstrike lots, all kinds of other stuff at random though
09:30:09 <bourbaki> we played CS a lot at my old company :) that was great fun
09:30:26 <bourbaki> i played a lot of nwn recently in the holidays but i quit :)
09:30:33 <Philippa> I only just got online - rather predictably slaughtered my way up a rank, then realised I don't know things beyond tier one combat because all the morons I was playing couldn't challenge me by the time I hit tier 2
09:30:55 <Philippa> (Eldar on 1v1 maps, I was doing the webway gate/turret thing to hold a bit over half the map early on)
09:31:18 <bourbaki> though i thought about buying something like these big online shooters
09:31:30 <Philippa> I should've got UT2k4 at the time
09:31:33 <bourbaki> but its all too hectic for me :)
09:31:42 <Philippa> loved the original UT, though the sequels are thoroughly not the same
09:31:44 <Philippa> heh
09:31:53 <Philippa> I used to play a lot of Street Fighter - I like a certain kind of hectic
09:32:09 <bourbaki> we play medal of honor or so occasionally in a lan when im home
09:32:21 <bourbaki> yeah street fighter is cool :)
09:32:35 <bourbaki> i love beat em up games a pitty that there are none for the px
09:32:36 <bourbaki> pc
09:32:46 <bourbaki> but i own all consoles :)
09:32:54 <bourbaki> despite some older ones
09:32:55 <Philippa> it's not an overly great platform for it, what with not being able to frame-lock effectively
09:33:15 <Philippa> heh. My sister had two Jaguars at one point...
09:33:24 <bourbaki> hehehe what for ?:)
09:33:37 <Philippa> dunno, she's an Atari nut
09:33:39 <bourbaki> the best beat em up game is virtua fighter 5 :)
09:33:44 <bourbaki> er 4
09:33:56 <Philippa> I never got into the VF series, but then I never knew anybody who could introduce me to it properly
09:34:08 <bourbaki> well i mastered all other games
09:34:20 <bourbaki> and vf4 is the toughest one and has a cool ai
09:34:23 <Philippa> SFA3's an old favourite of mine, and DOA2's good for folks who aren't used to the genre because they get to the meat quickly IYSWIM
09:34:29 <Philippa> ah, I don't play SP much
09:34:34 <Philippa> you played any of the Guilty Gear games?
09:34:44 <bourbaki> nope never even heared of it :)
09:35:16 <bourbaki> DOA is not that bad really you need to be strategic still despite the little amount of buttons
09:35:37 <Philippa> yeah, the only problem is if you zone out and can suddenly counter everything
09:35:37 * bourbaki is the counter man in DOA ;)
09:35:50 <Philippa> *everybody's* the counter man in DOA. Even women.
09:35:54 <bourbaki> heh
09:36:02 <Philippa> though I got fairly good at dummying out and throwing people in response
09:36:10 <bourbaki> you really should try to get vf4
09:36:17 <Philippa> used to do a lot of Bayman vs Jann Lee fights
09:36:19 <bourbaki> the counter system is really cool
09:36:27 <bourbaki> :)
09:36:48 <bourbaki> you can make side steps and have to use combos in the side steps and such its really hard
09:36:52 <Philippa> the folks who reckon JL's overbalanced haven't realised all his moves go exactly where it looks like they will from about 2 frames into the animations...
09:37:10 <Philippa> yeah, games like that tend to weird me out at first, takes a while to get a controller -> body mapping
09:37:22 <bourbaki> yep but i think they did a lot of balanceing on DOA3 on the xbox
09:37:24 <Philippa> stuff like SF and DOA's so abstract I don't need it
09:37:31 <Philippa> DOA3 didn't feel right here
09:37:44 <Spark> :o
09:37:44 <bourbaki> yeah it was rather disappointing after 2
09:37:49 <Philippa> 'lo Spark
09:37:51 <Spark> ello
09:38:00 <Spark> the type course at imperial college is excellent
09:38:03 <Philippa> we're discussing fighting games
09:38:04 <Philippa> cool
09:38:12 <bourbaki> a game i had high hopes in was way of the samurai
09:38:26 <Spark> as in beat-em-ups?
09:38:30 <bourbaki> yep
09:38:35 <Spark> most games involve conflict in some form :)
09:38:58 <bourbaki> btw http://205.188.234.37:8038 << good radio stream :)
09:39:04 <Philippa> what kinda stuff?
09:39:27 <TheHunter> peti, i get an Exception here.
09:39:35 <bourbaki> it says "monkey beats grooving sexy beats" :)
09:39:41 <Spark> i never progressed beyond learning one move and using it constantly, or just hammering the keypad and behaving arbitrarily (which worked really well)
09:39:45 <bourbaki> slow and nice hacker music
09:39:55 <Spark> no audio hardware here :)
09:40:13 <bourbaki> what? i cant live without music and tv running constantly
09:40:23 <Spark> these labs are inhuman
09:40:27 <bourbaki> yeah
09:40:33 <Spark> its all gleaming white paint and no food / drink
09:40:38 <Spark> not even any decoration really
09:40:43 <bourbaki> lab rat ;)
09:41:32 <bourbaki> all i need is to get a cook and an admin in here at home :) then i wont have to leave the 4 walls ever again
09:41:42 <Philippa> erk
09:41:44 <Spark> yeah i just got a phoneline in
09:41:46 <Philippa> going outside good...
09:41:50 <Spark> so i shouldnt need to be here except between lectures
09:42:09 <bourbaki> but anyone i asked resisted the tempting offer to live in my wall closet :)
09:42:12 <Spark> plenty to do in london :o
09:42:17 <bourbaki> well i just go out once a month
09:42:26 <Spark> i go out saturday night and thats about it
09:42:29 <bourbaki> i have little money to spend
09:42:31 <Spark> mind you it takes all of sunday to recover
09:42:41 <bourbaki> and i dont know any ppl anyway :)
09:43:05 <bourbaki> so when i go out i just sit at a bar drinking my obligatory import beer and a sambuca and then stagger home
09:43:11 <Spark> heh
09:43:11 <Philippa> I'm pretty badly broke atm, been having to pay my b/f's rent 'til he gets his student support through
09:43:27 <Spark> no overdraft?
09:43:27 <Philippa> haven't been to a decent pub in ages, sadly
09:43:35 <Philippa> overdraft hard up against the limit
09:43:38 <Spark> thats how i managed to survive before my bursary came in
09:43:48 <Spark> yeah mine is at 1499 or something :)
09:43:48 <Philippa> the problem is I'm paying for him /and/ me
09:44:06 <Philippa> that's £400/month before we even look at bills, food...
09:44:13 <Spark> i live in a shithole and its still 85 quid a week
09:44:17 <Spark> london--
09:44:24 <bourbaki> woop
09:44:25 <Philippa> yeah, I have no intention of living in london whatsoever
09:44:49 <bourbaki> livining at the countryside is the best place to live imho
09:45:02 <Spark> there are positive sides to london as well
09:45:08 <Spark> it depends on how much you value things like loads of live gigs
09:45:11 <Spark> cool clubs
09:45:23 <bourbaki> you can go there still when you dont live there
09:45:25 <Spark> the novelty of public transport that isnt utter shite
09:45:27 <Philippa> Nottingham has these things
09:45:56 <Spark> yeah but if you have to travel to london, it becomes a special occasion, rather than the routine :)
09:46:10 <bourbaki> when i want to go to a cool club i just stay awake till the next day and then go home by train or such
09:46:21 <Spark> munter
09:46:35 <Spark> i used to do that a couple of times before i moved here
09:46:35 <bourbaki> munter ?:)
09:46:49 <Spark> staying awake all night = druggy :)
09:46:53 <bourbaki> well i like to do it that way its a lot cooler
09:47:56 <bourbaki> but i rate the ability to jog in the woods higher then the ability to spend a lot of money in clubs :)
09:48:36 <bourbaki> at home i just jog 5 mins to a lake and live directly next to the woods thats a lot cooler then liveing in a city and more quiet
09:48:57 <shapr> heya Spark 
09:50:15 <Spark> hi
09:50:34 <Spark> i grew up in that situation and got bored of it :)
09:50:43 <Philippa> Spark: you've just reminded me txa's running a 2nd/3rd year course on type theory here
09:50:48 <Philippa> if I end up going back part-time I'll see if they let me do it
09:50:53 <Philippa> (it's first semester)
09:51:04 <Spark> whats your situation, were you retaking?
09:51:13 <shapr> I grew up among at least twelve US states, so I'm fine with both, but I prefer living in the country because it's cheap, and I can code in peace.
09:51:18 <bourbaki> you have much cooler courses i think then i had here yet :)
09:51:25 <Spark> ive been told to read bits of pierce's thesis :)
09:51:32 <shapr> read his book!
09:51:36 <shapr> TaPL is *great*
09:51:41 <Spark> yeah i have read part of that too
09:51:47 <Spark> its good for reading on the train
09:51:49 <Spark> people get scared
09:51:53 <shapr> why?
09:52:01 <Spark> but you cant take it on the plane because its too heavy
09:52:03 <Spark> :)
09:52:11 <bourbaki> which book?
09:52:14 <shapr> it does make a decent self-defense weapon.
09:52:18 <Spark> types and programming languages
09:52:20 <Philippa> Spark: made it half way through the year then things got really shitty
09:52:21 <shapr> it's "The Brick Book"
09:52:35 <Spark> his phd thesis is full of errors though
09:52:41 <Spark> like all phd theses :)
09:52:52 <Spark> it was blatantly done the night before
09:53:06 <Spark> like referencing the same paper several times
09:56:14 <shapr> bourbaki: man, tekken is better than VF :-P
09:56:31 <shapr> I loved tekken 3
09:56:44 <shapr> I could do stuff no one had ever heard of.
09:57:12 <bourbaki> shapr no tekken is a lot easier then vf4
09:57:26 <Spark> http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~svb/ <-- is that guy anyone special?
09:57:36 <bourbaki> and the comp enemy in vf4 is the best if ever fought
09:57:38 <Spark> hes a really enthusiastic teacher
09:58:09 <shapr> I never played vf4, only up to vf3
09:58:54 <shapr> tekken 3 had a very flexible system.
09:59:17 <bourbaki> shapr yep i loved tekken also but it got too easy after a while
09:59:33 <Philippa> I remember the look on a friend's face as I learnt to do counters in Tekken over the course of a gaming session
09:59:36 <bourbaki> and vf4 has a lot of cool usefull combos and a cool counter system
09:59:38 <Philippa> he had a couple of major losing streaks...
09:59:59 <bourbaki> heh
10:00:10 <Philippa> after a while he learnt to stop throwing a strike on "Fight!" :-)
10:00:14 <bourbaki> id like to have a game like way of the samurai but cool :)
10:00:57 <shapr> Spark: that guy has some neat papers.
10:01:56 <Spark> hes my supervisor :) i like him
10:02:13 <Spark> i chose at random to do an independent study in 'intersection types in practice'
10:02:29 <Spark> and he was the bloke offering that option
10:02:47 <Spark> but he seems so much more with-it than the other lecturers
10:03:28 <Spark> at the beginning of the course he said 'i could give you something to digest like the other courses, but i want you to actually understand all that there is to understand' or something along those lines
10:03:36 <Spark> and we're all like *boggle*
10:04:03 <Spark> and he actually teaches rather than reading out his notes or talking bollocks
10:04:32 <shapr> bourbaki: did you master style-switching with Lei in tekken 3?
10:04:32 <bourbaki> you cant teach in a usual class
10:04:47 <Spark> i guess it is quite small
10:04:48 <bourbaki> shapr yes that was my main char
10:04:50 <Spark> 25 people maybe
10:04:57 <shapr> Lei was my main too.
10:04:58 <bourbaki> still too big to ask questions
10:05:04 <bourbaki> seminars are alot better
10:05:12 <shapr> he was so flexible :-)
10:05:22 <Philippa> I didn't get to play that heavily - I was a fairly viable Jin, would like to've learnt Lei properly though
10:05:30 <Philippa> didn't have good opponents for T3 at the time though
10:05:34 <shapr> Though hwoarang's side-switching style changes could be cool.
10:05:42 <mento> Sorry for distrurbance but I'd appreciate if you could take a look a this little bug at http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview that I can't exterminate.
10:05:44 <bourbaki> that was my second char :)
10:05:59 <Spark> ive never had a decent seminar though
10:06:06 <shapr> is there some way to play t3 on Linux?
10:06:08 <Spark> cos when it gets down to that level, its always phd students doing the teaching
10:06:11 <shapr> even better, *networked* ?
10:06:25 <Spark> and theyre often somewhat confused about the subject matter :)
10:06:38 <Philippa> shapr: to play, use a PSX emu
10:06:42 <Philippa> dunno 'bout networked though
10:06:53 <bourbaki> well i have had a lot of seminars and i liked them better then lectures
10:07:07 <bourbaki> cause you can discuss things and give your own talks and such
10:07:17 <Spark> normally lectures arent worth the time - since they are no different that reading a book, only you cannot pause, skip back, replay, etc
10:07:36 <shapr> there's t3 for the psx? Hm, I only played in the arcade.
10:08:00 <bourbaki> ps2
10:08:03 <Philippa> yeah, dunno if there was a viable 'cade machien
10:08:04 <Philippa> *machine
10:08:05 <Spark> the only thing lectures have over books is youre forced to pay some attention in a lecture, whereas you can avoid reading the book and do something else instead :)
10:08:07 <bourbaki> there is no emu yet afaik
10:08:10 <Philippa> no, the PS2 only got Tag onwards
10:08:18 <bourbaki> ah right
10:08:23 <bourbaki> sry :)
10:09:03 <bourbaki> i have one seminar atm where we build a two legged robot soccer team of 2 robots
10:09:04 <shapr> I suspect the tekken manfacturers would flatten the mame guys if they supported t3
10:09:12 <bourbaki> and we play against another uni
10:09:27 <Spark> where do you study?
10:09:28 <Philippa> probably not so badly by now, they're putting out t5 soon (supposedly somewhat simpler)
10:09:41 <bourbaki> uni osnabrueck / germnay
10:09:48 <Spark> there was some FRP stuff doing robots wasnt there?
10:09:51 <shapr> t4 had more stuff than t3? better combat system?
10:10:04 <bourbaki> hm not sure :)
10:10:09 <Spark> imperial college is really strict, conservative and anal
10:10:13 <Spark> warwick was much more liberal
10:10:22 <bourbaki> i just go to all things where i wanna go
10:10:28 <shapr> mento: I don't understand your problem.
10:10:34 <Spark> they'd never do anything like that at either uni though
10:10:43 <shapr> mento: you want Right Truee, but you got Right (Var "Truee")
10:10:48 <mento> yes
10:10:49 <bourbaki> i just dont tell them that im undergrad and most of the profs know me by now :) were a small facultiy
10:10:52 <Philippa> shapr: it had "fuller" 3d movement, but didn't really work well
10:11:04 <Philippa> Spark: ow, sounds like I really really wouldn't get on well there
10:11:07 <shapr> how does your parser work?
10:11:19 <Philippa> assuming any of them would actually touch me ;-)
10:11:26 <shapr> has 3D movement improved any since the last mortal kombats?
10:12:11 <bourbaki> not really i think
10:12:14 <Philippa> dunno. I have to admit, where I'd like to go now is more moving FPSes in on traditional beat-'em-up territory
10:12:20 <Philippa> I mean, I /like/ UT's movement
10:12:29 <Philippa> you've got a very different idea of space and timing though
10:12:37 <bourbaki> heh why is that?
10:12:49 <bourbaki> as long as you dont silly walk backwards ;)
10:12:57 <mento> I didnt wrote the parser, I'm supposed to specify how formulas are constructed in my data type and this information can be used by propParser.
10:13:02 <shapr> street fighter et al were designed for pair play
10:13:10 <shapr> UT was not.
10:13:20 <Philippa> that too
10:13:24 <bourbaki> there are fighting games for more then one player
10:13:31 <bourbaki> and with multiple enemies
10:13:32 <Philippa> though you still get people doing duels in FPSes
10:13:38 <Philippa> double dragon!
10:13:41 <bourbaki> yep
10:13:45 <shapr> yah, Tribes2 was great for dueling.
10:13:45 <bourbaki> urban combat
10:13:48 <bourbaki> shaolin
10:13:56 <Spark> Philippa: i imagine cambridge is worse :)
10:14:01 <bourbaki> way of the samurai
10:14:03 <Spark> im somehow glad they rejected me now
10:14:22 <Philippa> Spark: I get the idea cambs would've been fine about the bits I'm worried about at least. Workload would've been far too much for me at the time though
10:14:32 <Spark> mm
10:14:39 <Spark> i was well up for working at the beginning
10:14:45 <Spark> warwick turned me into a lazy bastard though
10:14:49 <Spark> and i lost all my maths skills
10:14:58 <Spark> forgot all the knowledge at least
10:15:01 <shapr> mento: I think the Truee stuff is confusing your problem.. it may not be the right approach.
10:15:04 <bourbaki> heh
10:15:07 <Philippa> shapr: the original UT had some great aspects to it, would love to take that and find ways to add bits to the movement system without just breaking it and stuff like that
10:15:09 <Spark> i spent the time playing with linux :)
10:15:20 <Philippa> yeah, I'm no good with maths any more
10:15:26 <Philippa> though my intuition is a lot stronger
10:15:34 <shapr> I've never had a clue about math.
10:15:38 <shapr> maybe one day...
10:15:44 <Spark> :)
10:15:52 <Spark> i probably understand a fair portion of cmath
10:16:03 <bourbaki> cmath?
10:16:07 <shapr> that's what you get for being a 100% self-educated programmer.
10:16:15 <Spark> the book written by those 3 authors, one being knuth
10:16:20 <Spark> cant rememebr the other two
10:16:25 <Spark> patashnik and err
10:16:28 <mento> shapr: I agree but still parser should see that it's Truee and Falsee are specified and are not strings.
10:16:35 <bourbaki> Spark cmath is a book?
10:16:39 <Spark> yeah
10:16:47 <Spark> based on the course at stanford
10:16:54 <shapr> mento: if the parser is a given, then your data Prop probably needs to be something else.
10:16:55 <bourbaki> aha
10:16:58 <Spark> everytime i got to look something up in it though, its not there
10:17:03 <bourbaki> well i like good old math :)
10:17:19 <bourbaki> and what is cmath?
10:17:24 <shapr> I want a 2004 edition of the Principia Mathematica
10:17:28 <bourbaki> c as in colateral ;)?
10:17:55 <bourbaki> shapr just buy a good book on linear algebra and analysis and youre fine
10:18:36 <shapr> I doubt it... I had two hours on calculus in high school about fifteen years ago...
10:19:00 <shapr> oh I know.. I can do the "Haskell road to math"
10:19:39 <bourbaki> shapr a good book starts at the beginning you dont need any prior knowledge
10:20:04 <mento> shapr: What would you set data constants False and True if I have ambiguity problems ?
10:20:21 <bourbaki> anything you learn in school is shit anyway since there are a lot of gaps and you didnt proof it
10:20:24 <shapr> mento: maybe use a unary type constructor?
10:20:35 <shapr> bourbaki: I never learned how to do proofs either.
10:20:53 <mento> Sounds good. I'll try it.
10:21:04 <shapr> informally I've read about it, but I doubt I could satisfy Coq
10:21:07 <bourbaki> shapr that all is in these books :) go and buy a book on linear algebra or get a good script
10:21:19 <shapr> a good script?
10:21:31 <bourbaki> the things the profs write for their lectures
10:21:35 <bourbaki> they are like books
10:21:36 <shapr> aha
10:21:50 <shapr> ok, I'll do that.
10:21:59 <bourbaki> i just print them at a copy shop in din a6
10:22:10 <Maddas> Oooh, Tekken 3!
10:22:19 <bourbaki> very handy i can carry my books then in my back pocket :)
10:22:42 <Maddas> bourbaki: heh
10:22:59 <bourbaki> i dont even own a bag :) for books and such
10:23:00 <mento> shapr: Arent Truee and Falsee unary type constructors :s +
10:23:13 <shapr> nah, they're nullary
10:23:41 <bourbaki> just carry a pen a a6 paper block and my small books :)
10:23:53 <sorje> cmath is concrete mathematics?
10:23:54 <shapr> I wish I had a cross between a palm pilot and a laptop, something with a lot of storage, a good display, and a touch screen.
10:24:09 <shapr> then I could put zillion of books on it and stick it into my backpack.
10:24:18 <bourbaki> shapr subnotebook
10:24:43 <bourbaki> 8.9" display
10:24:59 <bourbaki> or an ibook with 12" display
10:25:01 <Maddas> I found that I do prefer to read paper books, especially about things like Maths
10:25:17 <shapr> Maddas: bet I could persuade you otherwise ;-)
10:25:20 <bourbaki> so do i and thats why i print them as books :)
10:25:37 <bourbaki> i have shelfs of books here and papers
10:25:56 <shapr> I used to prefer paper printouts, but I realized I can't share my margin notes with others then.
10:26:16 <bourbaki> you make notes :)?
10:26:26 <shapr> so I have this idea for a shared research paper margin wiki called Fermat's Last Margin
10:26:35 <bourbaki> heh
10:26:38 <shapr> I make zillions of notes on all hardcopy I own.
10:26:47 <shapr> in my opinion, a book is a conversation
10:26:49 <bourbaki> i dont id never write in a book
10:27:01 <Maddas> shapr: Hmm :-)
10:27:26 <shapr> a book should be like a wiki, you put notes to yourself, connections to other documents, inspirations, doodles
10:27:33 <bourbaki> and i make little notes anyway i just wrote like 80 pages in 5 semesters
10:27:33 <Maddas> I dislike writing on books too, for some reason I can't determine. I just don't like the idea of writing on it :-)
10:27:36 <shapr> questions, jump-ahead ideas
10:27:46 <Maddas> shapr: Sounds nifty.
10:27:48 <shapr> what do you think the margins are *for* ?
10:27:53 <shapr> they're for notes!
10:27:58 <Maddas> I just can't write in a book :-)
10:28:02 <shapr> sick man...
10:28:06 <Maddas> :-(
10:28:17 <shapr> s'okay, I couldn't either atfirst
10:28:19 <bourbaki> no if your write to the rim you wont be able to read the text anymore after reading it 1000 times
10:28:22 <Maddas> I don't highlight things either.. that's just wrong!
10:28:30 <shapr> yah, I don't get highlighting
10:28:38 <bourbaki> i dont pay 100 euros for a book and then draw in it
10:28:40 <shapr> but notes... those are great
10:28:48 <bourbaki> and a day later i think it was shit 
10:29:00 <Maddas> Maybe I can find a handy system to take notes without hurting the book :-)
10:29:02 <shapr> if I start making notes in a book, I already don't think it's shit.
10:29:03 <bourbaki> you can always have a paper next to the book
10:29:07 <shapr> Maddas: FLM!
10:29:12 <Maddas> Heh :-)
10:29:13 <shapr> I lose papers
10:29:17 <Maddas> Me too
10:29:20 <shapr> but the margin sticks to the book
10:29:20 <bourbaki> heh :)
10:29:34 <bourbaki> but someday youll find them again
10:29:37 <Maddas> Hence 'handy', a way to attach a paper to the book without damaging it or making it unwieldy otherwise
10:29:40 <shapr> the downside is that I can't share it with other unless I risk totally losing it.
10:29:47 <shapr> I loaned out my first copy of tPP
10:29:53 <shapr> and I lost all the margin notes :-(((
10:29:54 <bourbaki> tpp?
10:29:56 <shapr> and I had bunches
10:29:59 <shapr> the pragmatic programmer
10:30:32 <shapr> anyway, I've come up with a nice way to do Fermat's Last Margin, using Flippi and darcs
10:30:40 <bourbaki> i guess i read most bookst to get ideas anyway
10:30:43 <shapr> I just gotta sit down and do it.
10:30:44 <bourbaki> like a novel
10:30:45 <Maddas> How do you lose margin notes?
10:30:53 <shapr> you loan out the book
10:30:57 <shapr> and it never comes back.
10:31:02 <Maddas> Oh :-(
10:31:30 <shapr> bourbaki: for me, the inspirations I have in any one day will never be there again.. I cannot reproduce them.
10:31:33 <bourbaki> i make books that i dont read no more a gift :)
10:31:46 <shapr> so I have to write them down as fast I can, or I lose them forever.
10:31:51 <Maddas> Hm
10:32:01 <bourbaki> shapr to me these are ideas that are not worth to be hold and if they come up again they are more elaborate
10:32:04 <bourbaki> they just grow
10:32:14 <bourbaki> i dont write anything down
10:32:24 <Philippa> writing can help you avoid reinventing the wheel though
10:32:33 <Philippa> I mean, I've had variants on the same idea so many times now...
10:32:43 <bourbaki> i just think about it until i have something that i can make use of
10:32:44 <Philippa> (yes, I spent a lot of time knackered, drunk etc)
10:33:05 <shapr> My day-to-day mental state varies so much, that I cannot reproduce ideas later, no matter how good they are.
10:33:51 <shapr> On the good side, you get to explore a lot more solution space that way.
10:33:54 <bourbaki> if its not reproducable its not very likely to be a good idea
10:33:54 <Philippa> and then you find out some bastard's thought of it, written all the papers... ;-)
10:34:06 <Philippa> bourbaki: or it could be a thoroughly inspired one
10:34:14 <shapr> bourbaki: but I can't reproduce *anything* if I don't write it down.
10:34:16 <Maddas> bourbaki: I disagree
10:34:22 <Maddas> bourbaki: It might just be a *very* good idea
10:34:22 <bourbaki> if i look at a prob and have an idea and the other day come to the same solution its a good one :)
10:34:32 <Philippa> once in a while that happens, your brain's somehow spotted some really well-buried link that turns out to be significant - a duality or an adjunction or something
10:34:36 <Maddas> bourbaki: Or it's just an easy solution.
10:35:08 <bourbaki> well i just do that all day :)
10:35:15 <bourbaki> and i dont write notes in lectures as well 
10:35:24 <bourbaki> and i still pass them
10:35:32 <Maddas> I write notes if I feel it's worthwhile.
10:35:40 <shapr> Recently, I found a really cool one-line solution to a difficult problem in Zope. The next day, I needed to use it again, but I couldn't remember the solution.
10:35:41 <bourbaki> id just loose them anyway :)
10:35:44 <Philippa> sure, undergrad stuff's easy, I never needed notes for that
10:35:56 <shapr> I went to the #zope channel, and they said that what I wanted to do was not possible.
10:36:04 <Maddas> shapr: Ouch :-(
10:36:18 <bourbaki> Philippa i have to attend lectures in 8 different fields :)
10:36:26 <Philippa> how different?
10:36:35 <shapr> But I still somehow hacked the data into Zope with a single line of code. That solution has never come back to me.
10:36:37 <Philippa> it's 6 modules to the semester here
10:37:16 <shapr> hoi dryan 
10:37:16 <bourbaki> neurobio lingusitics CS math ai psychology philosophy and ... *think think think*
10:37:20 <earthy> hm. making new instances for Num is *fun*. :)
10:37:36 <bourbaki> ive done 10 courses in the first semester and 11 in the second :)
10:37:37 <Maddas> Anyway, I tend not to have a very good memory, so if I think the lecturer is doing significantly more than just reciting from a book or stating cool things that I can't simply re-read, I write them down.
10:38:09 <bourbaki> ah of course and neuroinformatics
10:38:12 <sorje> Undergrad stuff is easy? I'm sitting on some math tasks at the moment and it appears to be everything but easy. ;-)
10:38:14 <shapr> Michael Faraday took shorthand notes during lectures, then copied them down longhand as soon as he got out of the lecture.
10:38:34 <Maddas> What are shorthand/longhand?
10:38:44 <earthy> Undergrad stuff is mostly  easy. ;)
10:38:56 <shapr> Maddas: shorthand is what secretaries use to record dictation
10:39:00 <Maddas> Undergrad stuff is where most people here fail :-)
10:39:00 <bourbaki> Philippa is that different enough ?:)
10:39:07 <sorje> I'm probably just stupid then. ;-)
10:39:11 <Maddas> shapr: Never heard of that.
10:39:14 <mento> shapr: using unary constructor helped much but it didnt solve the parsing problem. The parser still sees True and False as strings. I'll leave it in like this. Thank you.
10:39:40 <Maddas> shapr: Certainly sounds worth pursuing though.. I'll google hunt :-)
10:39:44 <Philippa> bourbaki: with the possible exception of neurobiology there's a very definite common thread in the stuff you listed
10:39:46 <shapr> mento: I still think there's a very simple solution...
10:40:07 <bourbaki> Philippa sure there always is and neurobio also fits in there pretty well :)
10:40:14 <earthy> Maddas: that's how it's designed. it's meant to be easy, once you know it, but relatively hard to learn.
10:40:17 <earthy> so that you have a good filter for those that can't learn.
10:40:26 <Philippa> right, I just wasn't going to assume it does because I find bio stuff is a bit "reverse engineering" for me
10:40:27 <bourbaki> there is not much difference in anything really cause anything is connected
10:40:42 <Maddas> earthy: If it's hard to learn, I wouldn't just call it easy.
10:40:46 <bourbaki> as you will learn when you read dirk gentlys holostic agence novels
10:40:53 <Philippa> there's a more clear thread between that lot than if you put in a physical engineering subject though
10:40:53 <Maddas> Many things appear easy once you know them well.
10:41:00 <shapr> yes, that's true.
10:41:03 <shapr> monads for example
10:41:04 <bourbaki> i kind of apply the same method to anything that i do :)
10:41:11 <Philippa> right :-)
10:41:20 <Philippa> I'd like to do a bit more of some of those subjects sometime too
10:41:34 <Philippa> Psych's on my list of potential 2nd degrees, as is philosophy...
10:41:44 <bourbaki> *shudders*
10:41:49 <marcot> Hello! I'm having a problem in understanding the definition of curry from the prelude:
10:41:51 <Spark> philosophy would be great
10:41:57 <bourbaki> nah not really
10:42:08 <bourbaki> imho philosophy is not very constructive
10:42:11 <Spark> its definitely worth reading a book about some time
10:42:31 <bourbaki> well i had to do that for some time
10:42:45 <bourbaki> and i think its not worth the time really philosophy of mind that is
10:43:02 <mento> shapr: can you just check quicklly http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview and tell me if you see anything wrong. Those are still unary just for examples sake.
10:43:12 <mento> I
10:43:15 <mento> changed
10:43:15 <Maddas> shapr: Do you type fast?
10:43:20 <Philippa> ah, yeah, philosophy of mind it's hard to find a worthwhile answer in
10:43:26 <marcot> curry          :: ((a,b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c)
10:43:40 <marcot> curry f x y     = f (x,y)
10:43:54 <bourbaki> and psychology is a lot of babbleing
10:43:56 <Philippa> bourbaki: what level of study're you actually doing? I was referring to the UK-style bachelor's myself
10:44:01 <marcot> I understand the signature, but I can't understand the definition. Can someone help me?
10:44:12 <Philippa> psychology's got a science trying to break out of it somewhere
10:44:12 <bourbaki> Philippa im doing a bsc as well
10:44:16 <bourbaki> Philippa in cogsci
10:44:20 <Philippa> ah, OK
10:44:24 <Philippa> that explains the subject mix
10:44:27 <Philippa> I'm plain compsci
10:44:28 <bourbaki> yep :)
10:44:50 <Spark> are you going to go into AI or something then
10:44:56 <bourbaki> me?
10:44:59 <Spark> yeah
10:45:06 <bourbaki> i do ai mainly since its my main subject
10:45:14 <Spark> or other related fields like nlp or computer vision
10:45:14 <Spark> ah
10:45:15 <bourbaki> my thesis is about it
10:45:30 <bourbaki> ive done a bit nlp at home and vision also
10:45:45 <bourbaki> but atm im intersted im my fp network and ai stuff
10:46:30 <Philippa> I'd like to do something that's probably usability but targetted at stuff that's inherantly complex, if that makes sense
10:46:34 <marcot> Can someone tell me a web site where I can get an explanation of this kind of definition?
10:46:57 <shapr> Maddas: yes?
10:47:01 <bourbaki> Philippa ? like
10:47:06 <Philippa> (x, y) is a tuple containing the values x and y
10:47:21 <Spark> software engineering fits that description :)
10:47:24 <Philippa> f e is what might be written mathematically as f(e)
10:47:28 <Spark> i dislike software engineering as taught at unis at the moment though
10:47:31 <Spark> its too 'business studies'
10:47:47 <Philippa> Spark: no, I'm more talking meta software engineering
10:48:25 <Philippa> things like what makes a useful conceptual framework, what makes one quick for a human to analyse...
10:48:35 <bourbaki> i just say java Spark :)
10:48:37 <Maddas> shapr: Hmm?
10:48:45 <bourbaki> Philippa thats kind of what i wanna do
10:48:52 <Spark> mm
10:48:53 <Philippa> maybe a bit that's actually linguistic insofar as it's about how written language can convey the abstract concepts quickly
10:48:54 <Spark> whats that called
10:49:02 <Spark> data representation?
10:49:04 <shapr> Maddas: you ask if I type fast...
10:49:06 <Spark> something like that
10:49:16 <bourbaki> Philippa i want to build a framework where you can have networks that model the standard ai algos
10:49:21 <Maddas> shapr: Oh :-)
10:49:25 <bourbaki> so you can mix them
10:49:25 * Maddas cackles
10:49:29 <Spark> i was curious about the power of graphical language if it were developed as far as language has, as a medium for computer programming
10:49:36 <shapr> Maddas: why do you ask?
10:49:49 <Maddas> Just curious
10:49:56 <Philippa> Spark: you're thinking about it in an AI context, I'm talking more about interacting well with human data representation
10:50:12 <Philippa> bourbaki: hrmm...
10:50:12 <Maddas> Since you brought up shorthand notation.... :-)
10:50:18 <bourbaki> Philippa knowledge rep is related to ai
10:50:21 <Spark> i was thinking from a development perspective
10:50:44 <shapr> Maddas: but I also use hippie-expand, which is active shorthand
10:50:50 <Spark> you know like those lambda graphs you get that represent lambda calculus terms
10:50:51 <bourbaki> i want to let these graphs be data and programs at the same time
10:50:55 <Philippa> bourbaki: sure, but I'm not looking at "how can knowledge be represented (efficiently)"
10:51:04 <Spark> something like that but extended to cater for a real programming paradigm
10:51:21 <Spark> knowledge representation then :)
10:51:28 <Spark> thats what i was trying to remember
10:51:33 <Spark> theres lots of research in that around the place
10:52:13 <Philippa> yeah, usually making the same mistake of forgetting to tie it to what kinds of knowledge the system wants to get at quickly - though maybe I'm just being sarky and/or blindly holistic
10:52:29 * shapr kicks the find command
10:52:30 <bourbaki> :)
10:53:01 <shapr> man, I do not understand Heffalump's extensions to the lambdabot Makefile
10:55:13 <mento> I'd appreciate if you could take a look a this little bug at http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage#preview that I don't know what couses it.
10:56:07 <shapr> I don't like make... I want maak!
11:00:55 <Lemmih> mento: How's propParser defined?
11:01:02 <shapr> dangit, how does -prune work with find?
11:01:03 * Spark finds the kick command
11:01:03 <Spark> :>
11:01:27 <Spark> right movement to an alternative venue
11:01:30 <Spark> back in 2 seconds
11:01:39 <Spark> actually ill probably do some work instead since i have a deadline midnight tonight
11:04:43 <mento> class PropClass a where
11:04:43 <mento>  true  :: a            -- the constant true
11:04:43 <mento>  false :: a            -- the constant false
11:04:43 <mento>  var   :: String -> a  -- generates a variable from a string
11:04:43 <mento>  neg   :: a -> a       -- generates the negation of an expression
11:04:43 <mento>  conj  :: a -> a -> a  -- generates the conjunction of two expressions
11:04:45 <mento>  disj  :: a -> a -> a  -- generates the disjunction of two expressions
11:04:47 <mento>  impl  :: a -> a -> a  -- generates the implication of two expressions
11:06:09 <Lemmih> mento: Saying that 'f' evaluates to something unexpected is hard to debug when you don't know how 'f' is defined.
11:07:57 <Lemmih> Welcome back marcot.
11:08:06 <mento> What is 'f' (just some function?) and are you meaning the pasteIt ?
11:08:52 <marcot> Lemmih: hello.
11:09:00 <marcot> Lemmih: have you read my question before?
11:09:04 <Lemmih> mento: You're saying that propParser evaluates to something unexpected but you don't tell how it's defined.
11:09:20 <marcot> Lemmih: I wonder that cause I wasn't identified with nickserv at that time.
11:09:36 <marcot> Lemmih: and maybe you here don't accept messages from people in this situation.
11:09:47 <Lemmih> What question?
11:10:31 <marcot> Lemmih: about the curry definition. I can't understand it.
11:11:00 <marcot> curry          :: ((a,b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c)
11:11:02 <mento> Lemmih: But I defined True and False in making an instance of propClass.
11:11:05 <Maddas> Heh, "While certified court reporting speeds vary with the requirements of each state, in New Jersey, for example, a speed of 225 w.p.m. is required". Impressive.
11:11:09 <marcot> curry f x y     = f (x,y)
11:11:43 <marcot> I understand the signature, but shouldn't the definition be the oposite in a natural way of thinking?
11:11:51 <Lemmih> mento: I still don't know what's propParser is doing.
11:11:54 <marcot> like curry  f (x,y) = f x y
11:11:56 <marcot> ?
11:12:11 <Lemmih> marcot: That's uncurry.
11:14:22 <Lemmih> Perhaps I misunderstood the question...
11:14:36 <earthy> okay. that seems useless: a variant of the Identity monad that can record numeric operations ;)
11:14:59 <Lemmih> @index propParser
11:14:59 <lambdabot> bzzt
11:16:06 <mento> shapr, Lemmith: sorry guys, I missed the fact that propParser is expecting "0" and "1" instead of "False" and "True". Thank you!
11:23:05 <marcot> Lemmih: what's propParser?
11:23:17 <marcot> Lemmih: is that related to my question?
11:23:42 <marcot> Lemmih: my problem is that in the signature, the argument is a function that has the first argument as a tuple.
11:23:59 <marcot> Lemmih: and the return is a function that has two arguments.
11:24:37 <marcot> Lemmih: but in the definition, the parameter passed is a function used with two parameters.
11:24:45 <marcot> Lemmih: I'll get back soonly.
11:26:23 <Lemmih> marcot: ((a,b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c) is the same as ((a,b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
11:27:46 <Lemmih> It takes a function and two variables. Then it apply the variables on the function as tuple.
11:30:38 <Lemmih> *as a tuple.
11:36:15 <Maddas> shapr: Shorthand sure does look interesting
11:39:33 <earthy> okay...
11:39:40 <earthy> haskell is weirding me out
11:39:48 <earthy> no, lemme rephrase that.
11:39:51 <earthy> ghc is. :)
11:40:46 <earthy> I've built a datatype Calc a to simply record calls to the functions in the class Num
11:41:21 <earthy> so that I can `do' calculations over any datatype (even though they may not have meaning, I'll worry about that later)
11:41:58 <earthy> however, my instance Num (Calc a) seems to need an instance of Show (Calc a)
11:42:29 <earthy> even though all I'm doing is map the functions in Num to the constructors of Calc...
11:42:50 <earthy> (but for fromInteger, which i'm leaving undefined)
11:43:10 <earthy> so how the *hell* does it deduce it needs Show?
12:01:30 <marcot> Lemmih: thanks a lot.
12:01:40 <earthy> !autolart
12:01:48 <marcot> Lemmih: now I understood.
12:01:48 <earthy> or you simply read the class definition for Num
12:01:58 <earthy> time for a break, obviously
12:06:15 <marcot> Lemmih: so when you say something like foo :: Int -> (Int -> Int), how can you tell if it is a function with 2 parameters that returns a Int or if it has one parameter and return a function?
12:06:47 <marcot> Lemmih: actually it is the same thing...
12:06:51 <marcot> Lemmih: ok.
12:12:54 <shapr> w00, darcs.cgi comes with the latest darcs-server debs
12:12:57 <shapr> much happiness!
12:12:59 <shapr> hoi goron 
12:13:08 <shapr> hm, I think it's got the stylesheet screwed up though...
12:14:50 <shapr> hey, anyone have a moment to test my new lambdabot darcs repo? darcs get http://www.scannedinavian.org/repos/lambdabot && cd lambdabot/lambdabot && make
12:15:14 <goron> hej shapr
12:15:51 <goron> shapr, I wil test it.
12:16:15 <goron> wil->will
12:16:38 <shapr> thanks!
12:17:02 <goron> shapr: It's not really working...
12:17:34 <goron> shapr: Should I put it on the Haskell paste page?
12:17:45 <shapr> sure
12:17:45 <goron> Oh wait, #flood is more easy.
12:17:48 <shapr> ok
12:23:06 <marcot> curry :: ((a,b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c // curry id :: a -> b -> (a,b) // curry (curry id) :: a -> b -> c -> ((a,b),c)
12:23:59 <marcot> Can someone help me understanding this? Why do when I apply a function that has 2 parameters to curry this happen?
12:25:11 <marcot> What happens? Is the c from curry <- the (a,b) from curry id?
12:25:40 <marcot> And (a,b) from curry = a -> b from curry id?
12:26:37 <marcot> And how can I make the unification of a -> b and (a,b) ?
12:28:03 <marcot> And why does the function curry (curry id) have three parameters?
12:30:01 <TheHunter> curry takes a function that accepts a pair and returns the function in the curried form.
12:30:35 <TheHunter> id is the identity function, in this case the identity for pairs, that is id (x, y) = (x, y).
12:31:02 <TheHunter> if you curry this id, you get the function \x y -> (x, y).
12:31:45 <marcot> TheHunter: I know this, my doubt is about the types of the functions.
12:32:09 <marcot> TheHunter: about how do I do the unification.
12:32:41 <TheHunter> curry :: ((a, b) -> c) -> (a -> b -> c) can be specialized to ((a,b) -> (a,b)) -> (a -> b -> (a,b))
12:33:21 <TheHunter> therefore, curry (id :: (a,b) -> (a,b)) :: a -> b -> (a,b)
12:33:47 <marcot> TheHunter: ok, this one is ok.
12:34:23 <marcot> TheHunter: the problem is about curry (curry id)
12:35:03 <marcot> TheHunter: or uncurry id?
12:35:08 <melkart> how can i map "read" on "getArgs" and assign the resulting list at a variable?
12:35:44 <marcot> TheHunter: uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a, b) -> c
12:36:02 <TheHunter> @type curry (curry id)
12:36:04 <lambdabot> curry (curry id) :: forall a b b1. a -> b -> b1 -> ((a, b), b1)
12:37:11 <marcot_> Sorry.
12:37:15 <marcot_> Samll problem here.
12:37:37 <marcot> Prelude> :type uncurry id
12:37:44 <marcot> uncurry id :: (a -> b,a) -> b
12:38:02 <marcot> Can a function have more than one possible type?
12:38:04 <shapr> goron: yes, I get the same error with 6.3
12:38:23 <shapr> works with 6.2.1 though
12:38:42 <marcot> id :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b)
12:38:43 <TheHunter> marcot, a function can have many types, but there is always a most general one (not considering extensions)
12:39:03 <goron> shapr: There goes your vacation...
12:39:18 <TheHunter> id can have type (a -> b) -> (a -> b) in some circumstances because this is a special case of a -> a
12:39:30 <marcot> TheHunter: I know.
12:39:42 <marcot> TheHunter: I'll use it to get in another type for uncurry id.
12:40:25 <shapr> goron: I'll just live with it for the moment :-)
12:40:33 <marcot> uncurry id :: (a, b) -> (a -> b)
12:40:45 <shapr> btw, anyone who wants commit access to the new lambdabot repo, send me your public GPG key.
12:40:59 <marcot> TheHunter: What's different from the hugs answer.
12:41:14 <marcot> TheHunter: and it's as simple as.
12:41:21 <shapr> or if you want commit access to any of my darcs repos on snowblind.ScannedInAvian.org
12:41:23 <marcot> TheHunter: but hugs makes another logic.
12:41:32 <TheHunter> @type (id :: (a,b) -> (a -> b))
12:41:33 <lambdabot> bzzt
12:41:39 <shapr> goron: thanks for testing :-)
12:41:50 <TheHunter> @type (id :: (a -> b, a) -> b)
12:41:51 <lambdabot> bzzt
12:42:02 <TheHunter> @type (uncurry id :: (a,b) -> (a -> b))
12:42:04 <lambdabot> bzzt
12:42:11 <TheHunter> @type (uncurry id :: (a -> b, a) -> b)
12:42:12 <lambdabot> (uncurry id :: (a -> b, a) -> b) :: forall b a. (a -> b, a) -> b
12:42:35 <TheHunter> so (a, b) -> (a -> b) isn't a type of uncurry id
12:43:09 <marcot> TheHunter: but why?
12:43:50 <goron> shapr: Thank *you* for lambdabot. (Feature request: When will you learn the beast to program?)
12:44:21 <marcot> TheHunter: using the id :: (a -> b) -> (a -> b) definition...
12:44:22 <TheHunter> uncurry id (1,2) ==> id (fst 1) (snd 1) => type error!
12:45:00 <TheHunter> sorry, uncurry id (1,2) ==> id (fst (1, 2)) (snd (1, 2)) ==> id 1 2 ==> 1 2: type error!
12:45:26 <marcot> TheHunter: I agree with you.
12:45:49 <TheHunter> you see in this example, 1 should've been a function
12:45:53 <marcot> TheHunter: I agree with you.
12:45:57 <shapr> goron: good question ;-)
12:46:33 <marcot> TheHunter: But if we have that id definition,
12:46:46 <marcot> TheHunter: we can use uncurry like:
12:47:22 <goron> shapr: I could add some computation tree logic. But that wouldn't be that useful, and would probably burn all your cycles :-)
12:47:29 <marcot> TheHunter: I found my error.
12:47:46 <marcot> TheHunter: -> is right associative.
12:48:11 <goron> shapr: Not your unicycle, though.
12:48:23 <shapr> hah
12:50:11 <earthy> gawd
12:50:36 <earthy> I need more type info out of ghc :)
12:50:48 <earthy> ghci, to be more exact ;)
12:52:39 <shapr> anyone else using darcs-server debs?
12:56:41 <shapr> yay, found and fixed a bug in darcs.cgi in the darcs-server debs.
12:58:50 <shapr> hiya viv 
12:59:19 * Oejet believes the lhs2TeX guide, when it states, that \\eval{} and \\perform{} are somewhat fragile.
12:59:37 <shapr> crap, found another bug in darcs-server debs
13:00:15 <Oejet> shapr: Is the bug in the Debian part or the Darcs server part?
13:00:46 <shapr> one bug is in the darcs.cgi, it's not getting the correct stylesheet. The other bug is that automagically created .forward files only work for exim, not postfix
13:12:22 <earthy> !sigh
13:12:46 <earthy> -fallow-overlapping-instances and -fallow-undecidable-instances are useful, if you need them. :P
13:12:51 <earthy> good, time to grab a beer :)
13:19:30 <melkart> how can i map "read" on "getArgs"?
13:21:17 <Lemmih> map read getArgs
13:21:43 <TheHunter> map read `fmap` getArgs
13:21:56 <Lemmih> mapM read getArgs
13:22:30 <TheHunter> oops
13:22:32 * TheHunter hides
13:22:55 <melkart> Couldn't match `[String]' against `IO [String]'
13:22:55 <melkart>         Expected type: [String]
13:22:55 <melkart>         Inferred type: IO [String]
13:22:55 <melkart>     In the second argument of `mapM', namely `getArgs'
13:22:55 <melkart>     In a 'do' expression: args <- mapM read getArgs
13:23:54 <Lemmih> Oh right.
13:24:08 <Lemmih> getArgs >>= map read
13:24:20 <Lemmih> getArgs >>= mapM read
13:24:30 <TheHunter> mapM read =<< getArgs, the one I said before, or just args <- getArgs; doSomethingWith (map read args)
13:25:12 <bik> is the haskell plugin for eclipse any good?
13:26:47 <Lemmih> I've only tried emacs and kdevelop in Haskell mode.
13:27:02 <shapr> ok, what have I forgotten to write up in my HC&AR submissions? I have #haskell, HaWiki, haskell-libs, curryspondence, and lambdabot.
13:27:07 <TheHunter> omg, the =<< variant is nonsense, too
13:27:36 <melkart> TheHunter: unfortuneately i cant do doSomethingWith (map read args)
13:28:08 <peti> fmap (map read) getArgs
13:28:15 <shapr> I'm sure I'm missing something... but I can't remember what.
13:28:27 <shapr> Guten abend yeti_ 
13:28:45 <peti> shapr: Wünsche ich ebenso, natürlich. 
13:28:48 <yeti_> good evening shapr ;)
13:28:59 * peti hmms.
13:29:07 <shapr> peti: hey man, that didn't look like UTF-8 to me...
13:29:11 <peti> I ned new glasses.
13:29:24 <peti> And knew kaeuboard.
13:29:28 * shapr grins
13:29:46 <shapr> oh right, I forget PreludeExts!
13:29:48 <shapr> doh
13:29:51 <melkart>    Couldn't match `String' against `Char'
13:29:52 <melkart>         Expected type: [[String]]
13:29:52 <melkart>         Inferred type: [String]
13:29:52 <melkart>     In the second argument of `fmap', namely `args'
13:29:52 <melkart>     In the first argument of `print', namely `(fmap (map read) args)'
13:29:52 <peti> shapr: Massive updates in the tutorial, by the way. It might be worth pulling again.
13:29:57 <shapr> peti: will do
13:30:03 <shapr> as soon as my HC&AR submissions are all done.
13:30:10 <peti> shapr: take your time ....
13:30:14 <peti> no need to hurry.
13:30:33 <peti> melkart: What type has the list you want to get back?
13:30:41 <Lemmih> melkart: s/args/getArgs/
13:31:32 <melkart> peti: [Num] i think
13:32:02 <peti> melkart: Should work. But Lemmih is right: the 'args' isn't right there, it's getArgs.
13:32:03 <melkart> Lemmih: that results in an even more complicated error message...
13:32:34 <melkart> i do : do args <- getArgs \newline print (fmap (map read) args) now... with the error msg above
13:32:43 <peti> @type getArgs
13:32:44 <lambdabot> bzzt
13:32:45 <TheHunter> @type map read `fmap` System.getArgs :: IO [Int]
13:32:46 <lambdabot> map read `fmap` System.getArgs :: IO [Int] :: IO [Int]
13:33:03 <peti> Why doesn't it do my query?
13:33:15 <TheHunter> @type System.getArgs
13:33:17 <lambdabot> System.getArgs :: IO [String]
13:33:20 <peti> Ah.
13:33:27 <shapr> lambdabot is picky.
13:33:40 <shapr> but I've just created a lambdabot dars repo if you want to submit patches.
13:33:56 <shapr> speaking of which, I gotta commit kosmikus' two patches.
13:34:07 <wilx> Hmm, I am reading the report.
13:34:15 <Lemmih> melkart: If you do 'args <- getArgs' then there's no fuzz at all and a 'map read args' should do.
13:34:15 <wilx> About GHC.
13:34:18 <wilx> What is C--?
13:34:19 <peti> shapr: I'll give it a try. Just saw the URL in the backlog.
13:34:28 <shapr> wilx: http://cminusminus.org/
13:34:36 <melkart> Lemmih: but it doesnt... i think read is an IO something isnt it?
13:34:57 <TheHunter> no, getArgs is an IO something.
13:35:06 <Lemmih> @type read
13:35:07 <lambdabot> read :: forall a. (Read a) => String -> a
13:35:26 <peti> shapr: Why is lambdabot in yet another subdirectory in the repository?
13:35:51 <peti> shapr: find: invalid predicate `-path./_darcs'
13:35:55 <shapr> peti: no real reason, seemed simpler to create tgzs that way.
13:35:56 <Lemmih> melkart: You can't just use read without specifying the type.
13:36:06 <melkart> i see
13:36:17 <peti> shapr: Doesn't "darcs dist" do that automatically anyway?
13:36:24 <shapr> peti: I just sent in the patch to fix that, my mail isn't making it in :-/
13:36:29 <Lemmih> melkart: The behaviour of read is dictated by it's type.
13:36:33 <shapr> it needs a space before the first '
13:36:39 <shapr> -path './_darcs'
13:36:55 <melkart> it works! :))))
13:37:00 <Lemmih> Yay.
13:37:04 <melkart> thank you.. sorry that i didnt understand it before
13:37:20 <shapr> peti: hey, if you have a public gpg key, I can add you to lambdabot's allowed_keys
13:37:42 * shapr is considering symlinking all the various allowed_keys to a single '#haskell_keys' file
13:38:32 <shapr> I'll fix my darcs mail after I've sent in the HC&AR mail. Working on the last entry....
13:38:47 <peti> shapr: 0x99089D72 on any key server
13:39:07 <shapr> ok, cool.
13:41:04 <peti> shapr: We need a glue module that builds the lambdabot stuff into Postmaster. So that you can ask your MTA for Haskell types, too. 
13:41:11 <peti> shapr: And mail you the current sources. :-)
13:41:22 <shapr> ask your MTA for haskell types??
13:41:32 <peti> shapr: Would be cool. 
13:41:38 <shapr> a @type command in postmaster?
13:41:46 <peti> send an e-mail to a special address :-)
13:41:58 <shapr> I think mailing out the current sources would be way sexy, though maybe subject to spamming.
13:42:02 <bik> has anyone even tried the eclipse haskell plugin?
13:42:13 <shapr> bik: I've only heard of it, I don't use Java apps.
13:42:39 <shapr> peti: on the good side, if postmaster does win32, darcs will no longer be limited to MAPI on win32
13:42:46 <bik> for political or technical reasons?
13:43:00 <shapr> bik: political I guess, Java is closed source.
13:43:37 <peti> shapr: I'd love for Postmaster to work under Windows. That would be very nice. But I can't do theport. I know nothing about Windows. Really nothing.
13:43:51 <shapr> I don't want to invest time in learning any software that does not allow me to use my programmer skills to fix that same software.
13:44:07 <shapr> It's like a mechanic buying a car that has the hood welded shut.
13:44:54 <wilx> Hmm, you are not allowed to temper with todays cars iirc.
13:45:00 <wilx> All the electronics and stuff...
13:46:14 <shapr> hopefully someone will port it to windows.
13:46:14 <shapr> iirc, select doesn't do well on windows.
13:47:17 <TheHunter> [ot] any suggestions for a decent mp3 player?
13:47:27 <shapr> ok, seven HC&AR entries, 1. Haskell on IRC 2. Haskell Wiki 3. IOHCC 4. haskell-libs 5. lambdabot 6. curryspondence 7. LicensedPreludeExts
13:47:27 <shapr> Have I forgotten anything?
13:47:27 <shapr> I'm sure I have... no idea what.
13:47:32 <TheHunter> (software, that is, for linux)
13:47:48 <shapr> TheHunter: for what purpose?
13:47:48 <yeti_> TheHunter: mp3blaster (console & ncurses) or xmms (gtk1)
13:47:58 <shapr> I use alsaplayer because I wrote elisp bindings for it.
13:47:59 <TheHunter> xmms sucks
13:48:15 <bik> I guess I think of Java as a language more than a byte code compiler and a vm. Those are implementation details that classpath or something of that sort will eventually work out
13:48:24 <TheHunter> basically for playing music, but i think i need pretty advanced features
13:48:24 <shapr> Igloo said that gstreamer is more sane from a programmable/scripting viewpoint.
13:48:32 <yeti_> TheHunter: yeah, but there are not many gui alternatives to xmms
13:48:51 <TheHunter> yeti_, i'm so pissed at xmms atm.
13:49:06 <shapr> bik: well, until they're worked out...
13:49:19 <bik> yeah I understand.
13:49:31 <shapr> alsaplayer has a decent gui, but I think you should try gstreamer first.
13:49:51 <shapr> gstreamer is nifty, it's like shell scripting for media
13:50:13 <shapr> bik: of course, I've been hoping those issues would get worked out since java was in beta many years ago.
13:50:21 <yeti_> TheHunter: i'm pissed at xmms too :( i haven't tried this gstreamer thing yet, so i might try that :)
13:50:40 <TheHunter> ok thanks, i'll try gstreamer and see if it works for me
13:51:18 <shapr> Igloo: ayh?
13:51:29 <shapr> hm, idle for 26 hours, I guess not.
13:52:08 <yeti_> shapr: does gstreamer have an interface or is it just a library?
13:52:15 <shapr> TheHunter: darcs get http://urchin.earth.li/darcs/ian/hgstreamer
13:52:20 <shapr> yeti_: I don't remember
13:52:29 <shapr> I think it had an interface
13:52:29 <bik> it seems like there is so much more support for mono, but I'm not all that cheery about that either
13:53:05 <shapr> imho, closed source is the ultimate in vendor lock-in.
13:53:20 <shapr> it's just not worth investing learning time, for me.
13:53:54 <TheHunter> shapr, cool
13:54:01 <bik> well, to bring it back around, I'm not trying to learn Java, I'm just trying to get a decent haskell ide :)
13:54:18 <shapr> emacs is decent
13:54:22 <TheHunter> apt-cache search gstreamer is kinda freakin me out.
13:54:35 <shapr> :-)
13:55:11 <shapr> gstreamer, jack, alsa, etc are becoming really cool. Linux is getting the equivalent of shell-script for media.
13:56:03 <shapr> jack lets you hook graphical display/edit controls into any of your running jack streams and change everything on the fly, it's perfect for mixing.
13:56:20 <yeti_> shapr: is there a good vim-style ide, too? vim isn't really an ide, is it? i'm not trying to start a flame war, i just like the vi-style more than the emacs-style of editing
13:56:51 <shapr> I know that vim has haskell support. I don't know about a vim ide.
13:57:11 <bik> yeah, vim has syntax hilighting at least
13:57:40 <melkart> i have: let a = arg!!0 ; n = arg!!1 ; b = arg!!2 in print (arg, [a,n,b], (hyper 3 4 3), (hyper a n b)). why do i get: ([3,4,3],[3,4,3],7625597484987,2030534587)? why do i get different results for (hyper 3 4 3) and (hyper a n b)?
13:57:46 <shapr> yeti_: oh, if you like vim and haskell... darcs get http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi
13:59:35 <shapr> dons: hey, want me to put a yi repo on ScannedInAvian.org? The only advantage there would be a publically viewable darcs.cgi, though email commits might be handy once more people start sending in patches.
14:00:45 <yeti_> shapr: i like vim, and i'm starting to like haskell, i hope :) . i don't have much programming experience at all, and no experience with haskell or similar languages, but haskell seems to be really cool
14:00:52 <shapr> ok, HC&AR submissions sent... now to fix email commits on ScannedInAvian
14:01:09 <shapr> yeti_: I agree, Haskell is really cool.
14:01:57 <wilx> *nod* 
14:02:33 <shapr> doh, I know why my patches didn't make into the repos
14:02:35 * shapr grumbles.
14:03:12 <yeti_> is there any standard book which would help me learning haskell? i'm reading "two dozen short lessons in haskell.ps" at the moment, but i like books better than files ;)
14:03:56 <shapr> there's "Yet Another Haskell Tutorial"
14:04:10 <shapr> @learning
14:04:10 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "learning", try "lambdabot: @listcommands
14:04:12 <bik> I have a pretty decent book
14:04:13 <shapr> @learn
14:04:13 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/learning.html
14:04:58 <bik> "Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming" by Simon Thompson
14:05:20 <yeti_> ah, thx - i've already visited that site and looked at the not-so-gentle gentle introduction to haskell ;)
14:05:24 <yeti_> bik: thanks
14:06:15 <bik> no problem. That's the book that they recommend in my class, it has a lot of good stuff.
14:07:21 <melkart> good night
14:08:55 <shapr> peti: ok, you can commit to lambdabot 
14:10:08 <shapr> anyone else want to do lambdabot commits?

14:40:40 * shapr starts on the postmaster tutorial.
14:45:41 <wilx> Hmm.
14:46:06 <wilx> I am having problems with OpenGL examples.
14:46:17 <wilx> I get link time error,
14:47:31 <wilx> D:/ghc/ghc-6.2/libHSGLUT.a(Window__53.o)(.text+0x85):ghc14736.hc: undefined reference to `glutCreateWindow@4'
14:47:32 <wilx> etc.
14:54:09 <shapr> have you checked the HOpenGL mailing list? this sounds like an error that went by recently.
15:50:24 <abstrato_general> nothing but trouble.
15:50:39 <abstrato_general> what exactly is wrong with this snippet of code?
15:50:41 <abstrato_general> http://rafb.net/paste/results/1stydR87.html
15:51:14 <abstrato_general> ERROR "c:\fib.hs":3 - Type error in application

15:54:41 <TheHunter> @type take
15:54:42 <lambdabot> take :: forall a. Int -> [a] -> [a]
15:54:52 <abstrato_general> yes, but.
15:55:01 <abstrato_general> sum (take n list) is an integer 
15:55:05 <TheHunter> take expects an Int, but you are giving it an Integer
15:55:33 <TheHunter> so take (fromInteger n) or changing the type signature to Int -> Int(eger) should do the trick
15:55:52 <abstrato_general> oh, Int != Integer.
15:56:11 <TheHunter> Int is bounded, Integer isn't
15:56:28 <tromp> @index mod
15:56:28 <lambdabot> GHC.Real,Prelude
15:58:43 <abstrato_general> I changed the type signature of sumfib to Int -> Int, and it still won't work.
15:58:50 <abstrato_general> i'll try fromInteger
15:59:35 <abstrato_general> anyway, thanks for trying anyway :-)
16:00:04 <TheHunter> you can also leave out the type sig, and look what the typechecker infers.
16:01:38 <arjanb> signature Int -> Integer works here
16:01:51 <abstrato_general> sumfib works.
16:01:56 <abstrato_general> It's lissum that is strange.
16:02:14 <abstrato_general> lissum is supposed to be an infinite list of sumfib 1, sumfib2, etc.
16:02:24 <abstrato_general> I'll repaste the new version, just a min.
16:04:25 <abstrato_general> http://rafb.net/paste/results/srrOZp79.html
16:04:45 <abstrato_general> the function sumfib works now. lissum is choking.
16:06:52 <TheHunter> what's lissum supposed to do?
16:07:11 <abstrato_general> lissum is supposed to be an infinite list of sumfib 1, sumfib2, etc.
16:07:29 <abstrato_general> anyway, how do I make an Integer an [Integer]?
16:07:34 <abstrato_general> is there any function like fromInteger?
16:07:46 <dons> moin
16:07:57 <abstrato_general> @type moin
16:07:58 <lambdabot> bzzt
16:08:07 <TheHunter> abstrato_general: you just wanna lose the : [] at the end.
16:08:21 <abstrato_general> I didn't have that in the beginning.
16:08:41 <abstrato_general> uh, loads now.
16:08:47 <abstrato_general> kinda embarassed :-)
16:08:50 <abstrato_general> anyway, thanks everyone!
16:15:47 <abstrato_general> is there any convenient way to pick up the two last elements of a list?
16:15:52 <abstrato_general> I know about head and tail, but.
16:16:18 <arjanb> why do you need that?
16:16:34 <abstrato_general> I'm trying to produce the sequence of fib(n)/fib(n-1) now.
16:16:37 <sorje> take 2 (reverse list) ;-)
16:17:00 <abstrato_general> The limit of that is supposed to be about 1.618
16:17:05 <abstrato_general> ohh okay :)
16:17:42 <sorje> But don't expect it to be efficient. ;-)
16:17:56 <abstrato_general> yes, I'm just trying to get acquainted with the language,
16:18:35 <abstrato_general> bah, vi syntax highlighting for haskell sucks.
16:21:54 <TheHunter> abstrato_general: a nice way to do that: zipWith (/) fib (tail fib)
16:22:03 <TheHunter> anyway, good night y'all
16:22:10 <dons> vi has syntax highlighting? or nvi-linux?
16:22:29 <abstrato_general> Gvim.
16:22:43 <abstrato_general> I always think of "vim" as "vi" because I invoke it with "vi".
16:22:46 <abstrato_general> Silly me.
16:23:20 <dons> default vim syntax hl does suck -- please see the hl files on haskell.org for much better parsers
16:23:32 <dons> newer versions of vim use these
16:23:34 <abstrato_general> how do I make an {Integer]  a Integer?
16:23:38 <abstrato_general> it's a one-element list.
16:24:24 <dons> case ls of [v] -> v
16:24:38 <dons> good hl is at http://www.haskell.org/libraries/#editormodes
16:24:47 <abstrato_general> @type case
16:24:48 <lambdabot> bzzt
16:24:54 <dons> case is a language construct
16:24:59 <abstrato_general> ok.
16:25:08 <dons> if you know there is always 1 element, you could use head
16:25:21 <abstrato_general> ah true
16:26:22 <dons> shapr: mirroring the darcs repo is a good idea
16:26:26 <abstrato_general> hmm. I'm trying to divide two integers, but apparently I can't just declare the function Int -> Float
16:26:34 <abstrato_general> say, 
16:26:39 <abstrato_general> half :: Int -> Float
16:26:43 <abstrato_general> half x = x/2
16:27:15 <dons> you can't rely on implicit type casts
16:27:32 <abstrato_general> oh.
16:27:52 <dons> what is the type of / in your example above?
16:28:09 <abstrato_general> I don't know.
16:28:13 <arjanb> @type (/)
16:28:15 <lambdabot> (/) :: forall a. (Fractional a) => a -> a -> a
16:28:20 <tromp> g b 0=b;g b n=g(b+1)((s 0 n)-1)where s e 0=0;s e n=(mod n b)*(b+1)^(s 0 e)+(s(e+1)(div n b))
16:28:20 <tromp> main=print(map(g 2)[0..])
16:28:28 <dons> hehe
16:28:45 <abstrato_general> Prelude> :type (/)
16:28:45 <abstrato_general> (/) :: Fractional a => a -> a -> a      
16:28:48 <tromp> can anyone guess the next value:-?
16:28:49 <dons> tromp: but you should use layout and more parens to get rid of spaces..
16:28:54 <abstrato_general> uhh.
16:29:35 <dons> tromp: and lambda abstractions to get rid of where clauses..
16:29:48 <tromp> i tried to make it as short as possible
16:29:48 <abstrato_general> I don't seem to be very bright :-|
16:30:48 <dons> abstrato_general: libraries of common haskell functions you can use are documented at http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html
16:31:00 <dons> you'll find lots of good numeric functions there
16:31:06 <dons> just look for something with the type you need
16:31:12 <abstrato_general> oh ok.
16:32:31 <abstrato_general> Hugs doesn't seem to know the Fractional type
16:32:46 <dons> Fractional is a type _class_
16:33:08 <dons> a class of objects that behave like fractions
16:33:19 <abstrato_general> oh ok.
16:33:25 <dons> (Fractional a) => means that the 'a' must be in the Fractional class
16:33:37 <abstrato_general> great fun.
16:33:38 <dons> so / takes two Fractionals as arguments
16:33:45 <dons> but you've given it an Int
16:33:53 <dons> which isn't a Fractional at all.
16:34:04 <dons> hence my comment about implicit type casts
16:34:04 <abstrato_general> fromInteger :: Integer -> a
16:34:19 <dons> so you need to turn your Int to something Fractional before you can / it
16:34:27 <dons> heya shapr
16:34:29 <abstrato_general> so would fromInteger(x)/fromInteger(y) 
16:34:36 <abstrato_general> I have to test that. just a min.
16:34:39 <shapr> g'day dons 
16:35:00 <dons> shapr: you want to mirror yi?
16:35:03 <dons> sounds good to me
16:35:04 <shapr> sure
16:35:17 <dons> and send out commit emails.. that would be nifty eventually
16:35:25 <abstrato_general> yes!
16:35:29 <abstrato_general> it works :)
16:35:46 <dons> abstrato_general: in Haskell it's all about making types match
16:35:48 <shapr> have you seen the sexy darcs.cgi browser?
16:35:51 <dons> once you do that, everything works
16:35:55 <dons> shapr: yep
16:36:21 <dons> shapr: today is yank and pull, a nano emulation binding, and begin syntax hl
16:36:45 <shapr> spiffy
16:37:02 <dons> so, can we talk syn hl?
16:37:13 <dons> do we come up with a set of token classes
16:37:19 <dons> that map to most language constructs
16:37:29 <dons> i.e. Keyword, Variable, Type, TyVar etc
16:37:36 <dons> and bind those to colour settings
16:37:56 <dons> then the syn hl lexes the buffe generating a list of SynHL colour tokens
16:38:20 <dons> so user's just set, i.e., Keyword=Yellow, say
16:38:32 <dons> colour Keyword = Yellow
16:40:22 <abstrato_general> oh this is fun :)
16:40:30 <dons> yay :)
16:41:24 <shapr> dons: sorry, I got distracted by narcisstic urls: http://mw75.student.utwente.nl/~marianne/MarianneinLulea/photos/photo22.html
16:41:35 <shapr> right, let's talk synhl
16:42:13 <andersca> shapr: pratar du svenska
16:42:20 <dons> hehehe
16:42:28 <shapr> andersca: ja!
16:42:36 <yeti_> Exercise 3.6: Write a function that takes a list of pairs of length at least 2 and returns the first component of the second element in the list. <= I've thought about fst( head ( tail (a))), but that's not the way it's meant to be played (TM), is it?
16:43:50 <abstrato_general> this is powerful.
16:43:58 <abstrato_general> I wonder why there aren't many big projects in Haskell.
16:44:04 <dons> there are!
16:44:10 <shapr> yah, who says there aren't?
16:44:30 <shapr> dons: that sounds good to me
16:44:43 <abstrato_general> I'm an economist involved with Monte Carlo simulations, neural nets and the like.
16:44:47 <abstrato_general> stuff is usually done in Matlab.
16:44:54 <dons> scary
16:46:22 <shapr> you have a gpg key and a mail setup that works with darcs send --sign ?
16:46:35 <shapr> or should I just pull from you into the public yi repo?
16:47:07 <dons> I'll set up the gpg key soon.. but can you just pull for now?
16:47:20 <shapr> yow, 11 new patches!
16:47:28 <dons> good ones ;)
16:47:44 <dons> got over the window managing hump
16:47:48 <shapr> awesome
16:48:25 <dons> we mostly manage our own windows entirely in Haskell, so the UI is much simpler
16:48:45 <dons> (hmm.. we only use 3 or 4 ncurses functions, out of, like, 160..)
16:48:55 <dons> oh well, I guess that makes it super-portable
16:49:02 <shapr> yah, good idea.
16:49:19 <shapr> start out simple, get more specific later if we really need it.
16:49:45 <dons> yeah .. I just don't have time to sit down an optimise ncurses atm, and it's fast as it is
16:50:49 <shapr> it's way fast on my box
16:51:11 <shapr> I'd actually be fine with something slower that doesn't use IORefs... :-)
16:51:33 <shapr> not until I patch it myself of course.
16:51:36 <dons> the IORefs are about to disappear from Keymap.hs
16:51:42 <dons> (tuomo will be happy)
16:51:50 <dons> but I don't know about the buffer
16:51:51 <shapr> me too
16:52:07 <dons> it is just too large and flat a data structure to copy around
16:52:08 <shapr> well, disagree with patches
16:52:17 <dons> yeah, I don't mind that at all
16:52:19 <shapr> argue with unit tests, etc
16:52:43 <dons> a purely function, but still reasonable, implementation would be very welcome
16:53:26 <dons> the only IORefs now the ones that hold the mutable buffer in place
16:53:27 <shapr> what hardware are you developing on? how fast?
16:53:48 <shapr> just curious whether perceived speed is the same between us.
16:53:51 <dons> 1.6Ghz Thinkpad X31, 2.5Ghz P4
16:54:09 <dons> should try on my mac68k/netbsd machine ... hmmm
16:54:17 <shapr> and I'm on by dual Athlon MP 1.5GHz
16:54:24 <shapr> s/by/my
16:55:08 <dons> usually, though, the thinkpad is clocked down to 600Mhz, so that's probably the slowest I'm testing it at
16:55:28 <dons> good point though -- I do have slower machines, I might set one up for checking
16:55:42 <dons> and for testing things like TERM variables and friends
16:56:09 <shapr> yi memory usage is pretty good
16:56:34 <dons> I profiled it way down. The key is not to box any Char# until you have to draw them
16:56:38 <dons> and not to use length!
16:56:51 <shapr> yah, length kills
16:56:59 <dons> calling length in the UI.hs, which we did at one point, cause 5M files to use 100M rss
16:57:33 <shapr> dark whipped up an "atLeast" function that he used more than length in his code, several other people have written up similar functions.
16:57:33 <dons> IORefs rule for keeping memory usage down ;)
16:57:48 <shapr> I think maybe that's a standard idiom, whether anyone has noticed or not.
16:57:51 <dons> atLeast?
16:58:27 <shapr> in a bunch of cases you don't want to know how long something is, you want to know that it is atLeast n long
16:58:39 <shapr> like when you do zipWith [1..] (something else)
16:58:45 <dons> I use nelemsB -- just index a screen-sized segment of the buffer . that helped.
16:58:49 <dons> yeah. that's a good idea
16:58:56 <dons> nelemsB is sort of similar
16:58:56 <shapr> you obviously don't care how long [1..] is, only that it is at least as long as (something else)
16:59:03 <dons> you give an upper bound on how far to traverse
16:59:07 <shapr> right
16:59:14 <shapr> that's an important pattern for FP
16:59:27 <shapr> "length" is actually quite procedural
16:59:55 <abstrato_general> I like how this resembles actual mathematics.
17:00:02 <shapr> sounds like an interesting essay to write to haskell-cafe.
17:00:16 <shapr> "atLeast n as the FP alternative to length"
17:00:30 <dons> length considered harmful
17:00:32 <tromp> hi shapr
17:00:36 <shapr> hoi tromp 
17:00:44 <shapr> dons: yes exactly! because it so often is!
17:01:03 * shapr wishes Richard Braakman would come back to #haskell
17:01:05 <tromp> can you guess the 4th value in the following list l
17:01:09 <tromp> l=map(g 2)[0..]where g b 0=b;g b n=g(b+1)(s 0 n-1)where s e 0=0;s e n=mod n b*(b+1)^s 0 e+s(e+1)(div n b)
17:03:40 <shapr> that looks like a rather inveigled list,whatever it does.
17:05:07 <abstrato_general> I wish head [] wasn't undefined.
17:05:24 <abstrato_general> Can I declare "head [] = []"in my code? 
17:05:39 <tromp> it's only the slowest list ever written in one line of haskell:)
17:06:26 <shapr> dons: http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/yi/?c=browse
17:06:29 <dons> abstrato_general: you could write a safeHead, sure.
17:06:41 <tromp> no, abs, head should map [a] to a
17:07:00 <abstrato_general> I think I'm going about it the wrong way.
17:07:02 <tromp> i mean the type [a] to the type a
17:07:06 <abstrato_general> I have a list that eventually converges to 0.0
17:07:08 <abstrato_general> an infinite list.
17:07:12 <shapr> darcs.cgi is way sexy
17:07:25 <abstrato_general> What I want is to make a finite list out of it, one that stops when the infinite list has converged to 0.0
17:07:45 <dons> shapr: oh this is nice
17:08:00 <dons> it's way better than darcs.cgi I used with darcs 0.9.13
17:08:00 <yeti_> hm. f = \ x y -> 2*x + y  is the same as f x y = 2*x + y, right?
17:08:13 <dons> yep
17:08:28 <shapr> lovely colors showing what got changed in the last patch, easy browsing, etc
17:08:46 <dons> whoa. there's more patches in there than I thought
17:08:50 <shapr> yup
17:08:54 <abstrato_general> what is Yi?
17:09:04 <tromp> use takeWhile, abs
17:09:05 <shapr> you can click on a line in any file and jump to the patch that most recently affected it.
17:09:17 <tromp> @index takeWhile
17:09:17 <lambdabot> Data.List,GHC.List,Prelude,List
17:09:18 <yeti_> dons: is it just a matter of style, or should i use only one of them?
17:09:47 <dons> f x y = .. is the usual style, unless you explicitly need the lambda abstraction
17:09:47 <abstrato_general> tromp ok thanks :)
17:09:49 <tromp> converge = takeWhile (/= 0.0)
17:09:50 <shapr> nice pretty colors example at the bottom of http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/yi/Yi/Window.hs?c=annotate
17:10:13 <tromp> of course comparing floats to 0.0 has some danger
17:10:28 <tromp> you might get underflow instead of 0.0
17:10:36 <shapr> andersca: varfÃ¶r frÃ¥gor du om jag talar svenska?
17:11:00 <tromp> perhaps you'd rather compare to some small epsilon
17:11:50 <shapr> abstrato_general: Yi is an editor written in Haskell.
17:11:50 <abstrato_general> :))
17:11:58 <dons> lines crossed out, that cute
17:12:05 <abstrato_general> Oh. Darcs is like CVS and Subversion, right?
17:12:13 <shapr> yah, green for new, red for gone
17:12:18 <shapr> nah, darcs is usable ;-)
17:12:47 <shapr> darcs is very easy to learn and use. CVS doesn't really fit into easy.
17:13:03 <abstrato_general> cvs is an acquired taste.
17:13:28 <shapr> so is surstromming
17:13:30 <abstrato_general> anyway, how easy would darcs be to set up in a windows environment?
17:13:41 <shapr> not too hard
17:13:47 <shapr> grab one of the windows binaries, install it.
17:13:48 <abstrato_general> I need to introduce non-computer people to versioning for large latex documents.
17:14:08 <shapr> http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/CategoryBinaries
17:15:34 <shapr> man, Mark Stosberg is doing lots on DarcsWiki
17:15:52 <shapr> I get the impression I should hand the wiki over to him, since he's being really motivated about it.
17:18:03 <yeti_> thanks to everyone who helped me today :) haskell rocks, and you guys rock too :) good night everyone
17:18:12 <dons> cheers ;)
17:18:26 <shapr> g'night yeti_ 
17:18:32 <shapr> come back soon!
17:19:54 <yeti_> i will :) ah, i'd like to tell you how i foud out about haskell - i was trying to implement a binary tree in c, but my code was horrible
17:20:07 <yeti_> and then this guy said "hey, with haskell you can do that in two lines"
17:20:10 <yeti_> :)
17:20:17 <yeti_> well, gotta go
17:22:38 <shapr> hehe
17:22:42 <shapr> who was that guy who said that?
17:23:34 <shapr> Remind me to pay a bonus to our official fomenters of dissent on the next payday.
17:24:34 <abstrato_general> what is interesting about haskell is that strangers' code is readable after basic training.
17:24:44 <shapr> most of the time...
17:24:58 <shapr> there's still the occasional dark corner.
17:25:20 <abstrato_general> It looks like the ideal language for open source projects.
17:25:57 <shapr> I think Haskell isn't yet so good for embedded projects.
17:26:03 <shapr> But progress is being made in that area.
17:26:36 <abstrato_general> is there something like PyGTK for Haskell?
17:26:58 <shapr> speaking of which, I should send an email to Anthony Sloane and tell him to release his nhc98 runtime for PalmOS, no matter what state it's in.... We've been waiting more than year for his interim release.
17:27:12 <shapr> there's wxHaskell
17:27:23 <shapr> http://wxhaskell.sf.net/
17:31:54 <dons> I've seen nhc98 running on a 2x1 inch arm 'pleb' machine. that was kinda embedded. http://www.disy.cse.unsw.edu.au/Hardware/PLEB/
17:32:27 <shapr> palm is 68HC11, some weird flavor of 68000
17:32:41 <dons> yah, I know it well.
17:32:43 <shapr> That pleb is nifty.
17:32:48 <dons> 16bit 68000
17:33:05 <shapr> Lego Mindstorms is 68HC11 too. I used to have one of those.
17:33:29 <dons> didn't know nhc ran on 16bit machines
17:33:40 <dons> guess Int just isn't what you think it is ;)
17:33:56 <shapr> :-)
17:34:31 <shapr> Maybe it's just vaporware. I couldn't persuade Anthony Sloane to give up an interim copy to me even after three or four email spaced several months apart each.
17:34:38 <shapr> greetz Etaoin 
17:35:38 <shapr> Hey, how close is Yi to 0.1 ? Can we do that after yank and pull and nano?
17:35:43 <Etaoin> hi
17:36:32 <dons> shapr: you really want that, don't you :)
17:36:48 <dons> hmm. ok. how about I put in syn hl for .hs in the next 3 days or so ?
17:37:03 <shapr> I'd like to check out the buffer arrow idea. My enthusiasm is somewhat muted after Yampa had so much trouble doing several updates a second with a single collection of 2000 arrows... but it might still work.
17:37:33 <dons> yeah. we need a sit down and plan session on post-emacs after 0.1
17:37:44 <shapr> yah, I want to start on the emacs emu
17:38:05 <shapr> but I'd rather put any code I write into improving the initial release.
17:38:16 <shapr> until that magic 0.1 ...
17:39:05 <dons> ok. so you want something to write, other than arrows?
17:39:33 <dons> why don't you write emacs emu write now?
17:39:35 <dons> right now
17:40:05 <dons> take Keymap.hs and turn it in to Emacs.hs
17:40:10 <shapr> hm. ok.
17:40:12 <dons> I'll create a Syntax dir
17:40:43 <shapr> what should happen with the vi modes?
17:40:43 <dons> you could do the basic 20-30 actions probably
17:41:03 <dons> well, emacs is going to be modeless, yes?
17:41:08 <shapr> right
17:41:14 <shapr> at least, sort of.
17:41:45 <dons> ok. I'm currently wiping out the vi modes stored in state, in favour of returning the keymap function to use for the next character
17:41:57 <dons> so switching modes means returning a new keymap to the mainloop
17:42:09 <shapr> that makes sense.
17:42:16 <dons> so, very simple change from current code
17:42:57 <dons> you could just develop Emacs.hs in your own ~/.yi (see examples/ for this)
17:43:05 <shapr> ah, good point.
17:43:14 <dons> and I can integrate it by the end of the (aus) day
17:43:33 <dons> just have your ~/.yi/Config.hs import ~/.yi/Emacs.hs
17:43:52 <dons> btw, you need *latest* cvs hs-plugins snapshot for multi-module configs
17:44:00 <shapr> I won't have much time to work on it before sleep. I have to meet a friend in about nine hours.
17:44:15 <shapr> do you have a darcs repo for hs-plugins?
17:44:28 <dons> nope. it's in cvs because it is a uni project
17:44:35 <shapr> oh, ok.
17:44:48 <shapr> er, why is cvs used for the uni projects?
17:44:54 <dons> chakcvs
17:45:01 <shapr> ya know, Haskell research and all that... why not use darcs?
17:45:12 <dons> because chilli doesn't use darcs yet
17:45:18 <shapr> heh, fair enough :-)
17:45:39 <dons> anyway, you could just hack Keymap.hs directly, if you want. It will be easy to integrate
17:45:40 <shapr> Obviously I'm going to have to try to indoctrinate him just to make my life easier.
17:45:45 <shapr> ok, I'll do that.
17:46:17 <dons> it was useful to read the H98 report again and remember that ctrl chars can be written '\^G' :)
17:46:56 <shapr> any suggestions for dealing with 'nested' keys?
17:47:12 <shapr> like, opening a file is C-x C-o, but switching windows is C-x o
17:47:23 <dons> look at the ex mode binding
17:47:27 <dons> basically:
17:47:46 <shapr> aha
17:47:55 <shapr> "accumulate keys until esc or \n, then try to work out what was typed"
17:47:58 <dons> key '\^X' = do c <- nextc ; case c of 'o' -> ... ' ; '\^O' -> ...
17:48:48 <dons> sorry, c <- getcE 
17:49:22 <dons> so you have sub-lexers for multi-char stuff.
17:49:38 <dons> this is where Haskell regexes would be nice. or Lazy-Alex (tm)
17:49:51 <shapr> Would a Trie be simpler? something like data TrieK KeyChar :: FiniteMap KeyChar (TrieK | (editorcommand)) ?
17:49:56 <dons> or ctk lazy lexers.. (todo)
17:50:12 <shapr> ah, you're thinking about the same thing
17:50:25 <dons> I think that's roughly the table we'll get with a ctk lazy lexer
17:50:41 <shapr> except that a ctk lexer is way efficient for this sort of stuff.
17:50:48 <dons> yeah.
18:11:43 <maihem> What is a nice parser in Haskell (so I can write haskell code that looks similar to BNF)?
18:11:53 <shapr> BNFC
18:12:05 <maihem> shapr, thanks
18:12:11 <shapr> http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~markus/BNFC/
18:12:21 * maihem gets his google stick out
18:12:26 <maihem> oh, thanks :)
18:12:31 <Lemmih> shapr: When did you last contact a haskell.org guy? I wanna setup Hackage but John Peterson isn't responding.
18:12:44 <shapr> um, I dunno. Three days ago?
18:12:48 <shapr> er, no... longer.
18:12:48 <dons> he takes a little whlie, I seem to remember
18:12:52 * shapr checks his email.
18:12:54 <dons> maybe 4 or 5 days
18:13:28 <shapr> I got the strong feeling that Jon Peterson didn't really care what I did with haskell.org as long as I didn't break it, or piss off anyone in the community.
18:13:52 <Lemmih> shapr: So I can talk to you about it?
18:14:48 <shapr> I sent him a long email asking about installing HSQL, HaskellDB, and Hackage and he responded with "Sounds good to me. John"
18:15:12 <seafood> What's Hackage?
18:15:32 <shapr> seafood: it's that nasty gunk that builds up on your elbows after a long night of coding.
18:15:41 * shapr grins evilly
18:15:41 <Lemmih> haha
18:15:47 <shapr> g'day seafood, how ar ya? :-)
18:15:47 <seafood> shapr: hehe.
18:15:59 <seafood> I'm good. I'm in Seattle at the mo.
18:16:18 <shapr> whoa, nifty. Make sure you see the pig at pike market, and the ban roll-on building.
18:16:25 <Lemmih> seafood: It's a webpage for listing libraries, applications and tools.
18:16:41 <shapr> "pike place market"
18:16:42 <seafood> shapr: What is the ban roll-on building?
18:16:54 <Lemmih> seafood: Prototype: http://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/hackage/hackage
18:17:05 <seafood> It's now 6:20pm and I've got to leave at 10:30 tomorrow.
18:17:17 <shapr> It's a building about three blocks away from the hammering statue thingy that looks like a container of roll-on deodorant.
18:17:36 <shapr> oh
18:17:43 <shapr> in that case, pike place market ...
18:17:55 <shapr> or just wander.. Seattle is a city of guerilla art
18:18:09 <seafood> Too bad I don't have time to experience it properly.
18:18:11 <shapr> There's poetry on the front of stairs going down to the subway/busway.
18:18:32 <shapr> there are hidden garden alcoves between skyscrapers
18:18:50 <shapr> It's a beautiful city.
18:18:59 <seafood> Yes, I like it a lot.
18:19:06 <shapr> I miss Seattle sometimes.
18:19:09 <seafood> I did make it to the Museum of Flight. That was cool.
18:19:16 <seafood> How long did you live there?
18:19:22 <shapr> Oh hey, if you have time and interest, check out a club called the Catwalk. :-)
18:19:40 <seafood> What street's it on? Is it in Downtown Seattle?
18:19:43 <shapr> Only six months or so, but I'd like to do it again.
18:20:06 <shapr> I think it's closer to first hill.
18:20:15 <seafood> First hill?
18:20:41 <shapr> um, it's a bit north east of downtown, depending on where you are downtown.
18:20:59 <shapr> It's in the belltown area.
18:21:19 <seafood> Hmmmm. Sounds like a long wander.
18:21:19 <shapr> seafood: http://www.catwalkclub.net/calendar.html
18:21:23 <seafood> And I'm buggered.
18:21:31 <Lemmih> shapr: So are you gonna install the libraries or should I wait for John?
18:21:34 <shapr> Well, it's not that spectacular.
18:22:28 <shapr> If John doesn't do it, I will.
18:23:33 <shapr> Of course, I'd do it much faster if haskell.org ran debian instead of redhat =)
18:23:43 <seafood> ls
18:23:48 <seafood> woops wrong winder.
18:24:00 <seafood> which of course means window.
18:24:08 <shapr> seafood: just us irc bots here
18:24:09 <shapr> doh
18:24:58 <stepcut> doh
18:25:21 <shapr> ok, time to fall over... but I have a plan for the Emacs mode
18:25:23 * shapr cackles evilly
18:25:23 <stepcut> shapr: shouldn't you be sleeping, or something ?
18:25:27 <stepcut> @shapr
18:25:27 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "shapr", try "lambdabot: @listcommands"
18:25:33 <shapr> huh
18:25:35 <stepcut> @stepcut
18:25:35 <lambdabot> Sorry, I don't know the command "stepcut", try "lambdabot: @listcommands
18:25:40 <shapr> @listmodules
18:25:40 <lambdabot> I have the following modules installed: ["base","cmafihe","dict","dummy
18:25:40 <lambdabot> ,"dynamic","eval","hello","karma","quote","seen","state","system","topic
18:25:40 <lambdabot> ,"type"]
18:25:43 <shapr> strange
18:25:46 <shapr> @listcommands dummy
18:25:46 <lambdabot> Module dummy provides the following commands: ["dummy","wiki","learn","eurohaske
18:25:46 <lambdabot> l","moo"]
18:25:51 <stepcut> *sniff*
18:25:58 <shapr> juicy bits of code ;-)
18:26:04 <stepcut> heh
18:26:30 <stepcut> well, I am going home now
18:26:30 <shapr> I'm going to hack FactModule back into lambdabot soon.
18:26:34 <shapr> I'm going to sleep now.
18:26:51 <dons> night
18:28:15 <dons> IORefs be gone!
18:28:33 <dons> I think I want one of those "Whose afraid of a little unsafePerformIO" t-shirts
18:45:28 <Lemmih> Hello PianoAngel.
18:54:19 * peti sighs
18:54:40 <peti> 4am already ... :-(
18:55:49 <dons> 4am, what? it's 12 noon
18:55:53 <dons> oh no
20:33:42 <dash> hello, haskellians
20:34:03 <Lemmih> Hello dash.
20:44:04 <maihem> Anybody know, with bnfc, how to make a literal "~+" like you can "keyword", it seem to interpret "~+" as just "~" ?
20:45:36 <dash> Mmm. Hugs gives me a new error message every day.
20:45:50 <dash> this time, it is "Unresolved top-level overloading"
20:46:09 <dash> anyone care to help me understand what that means? :)
20:49:57 <Lemmih> I can help.
20:51:17 <dash> OK! is there a general explanation of what that means, or do you want to see the code? :)
20:52:03 <Lemmih> Overloaded functions are defined by their types. So sometimes (usually not in real application) you have to write the type explicitly.
20:52:16 <dash> OK
20:52:22 <Lemmih> Like: (read "10" :: Int) instead of (read "10").
20:52:25 <dash> so in my case, I probably have a bug.
20:53:23 <Lemmih> You can post the code here: http://haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcPastePage
20:54:32 <dash> i pasted it here instead :) http://rafb.net/paste/results/gUQ53G61.html
20:54:48 <dash> Hugs sez:
20:54:48 <dash> ERROR "arnis.hs":46 - Unresolved top-level overloading
20:54:48 <dash> *** Binding             : expr
20:54:48 <dash> *** Outstanding context : Num (GenParser Char d Quotable)
20:55:05 <dash> Oh hmm
20:55:06 <dash> hold on
20:55:13 <dash> i bet it was a stupid mistake.
20:55:35 <dash> Hmm, nope. Wasn;t.
20:58:17 <Lemmih> You probably tried to use a (GenParser Char d Quotable) as a number.
20:58:31 <dash> Ah, hmm
20:58:53 <dash> what is the usual procedure for tracking that sort of bug down? :)
21:00:14 <Lemmih> Reading through the line where the error occurs.
21:00:33 <dash> OK. Did that. Now what?
21:00:38 <Lemmih> Did you post the entire file?
21:00:41 <dash> 'cause this line looks correct
21:00:45 <dash> that is indeed the entire file
21:00:50 <dash> i think
21:00:53 * dash stares
21:01:24 <dash> Yes. 
21:05:07 <Lemmih> I'm getting the same error just at line 116.
21:05:13 <dash> Hmm
21:05:18 * dash pokes again
21:05:26 <Lemmih> 'a <- qqTemplate d-1' you probably mean 'a <- qqTemplate (d-1)'
21:05:34 <dash> Probably I do.
21:05:44 <dash> huh. are you using hugs?
21:05:51 <Lemmih> No. GHC.
21:06:20 <dash> Interesting that they'd give different errors.
21:07:22 <dash> Interesting that they'd give different errors.
21:07:30 <dash> erp wrong button.
21:07:34 <Lemmih> The code works fine when you change all the (f n-1) to (f (n-1)).
21:07:55 <dash> Yep, that did it.
21:07:58 <dash> Thank you.
21:08:02 <Lemmih> Error messages are not defined part of the Haskell language.
21:08:08 <Lemmih> You're welcome.
21:09:02 <Lemmih> You might wanna change the definition qqTemplate.
21:09:48 <dash> yeah, i realize this code is probably done totally wrong :) i'm basing this on the backquote grammar in R5RS
21:09:53 <dash> what should I change it to?
21:10:04 <Lemmih> The pattern match is overlapping.
21:11:09 <Lemmih> 'qqTemplate d' will successfully match when 'd' == 0. So the specific case 'qqTemplate 0' will never be reached.
21:11:26 <dash> Hm.
21:11:39 <dash> so how do you specify that? with guards?
21:12:30 <Lemmih> No. Just move it above the other definition of ppTemplate. They are match after appearance in the source file.
21:12:44 <dash> Ah. Sensible.
21:12:46 <Lemmih> *matched
21:13:15 * cm matches Lemmih 
21:15:12 * Lemmih throws an exception to cm.
21:15:26 <cm> *catches*
21:15:35 <cm> *rethrows dash*
21:17:07 * Lemmih returns to his cave and dwells.
22:08:52 <tintin> The Haskell School of Expression: Learning Functional Programming through Multimedia is the best dead tree book for haskell ?
23:18:16 <dons> hmm. almost ready to switch to yi.. :)
