00:00:29 <copumpkin> don't call me a hoare
00:03:04 <mjrosenb> copumpkin: http://cmubash.org/?1895 </cmuspam>
00:04:01 <copumpkin> :P
00:04:27 <Funktorsalat> warning: the fourth "kitten" isn't a kitten
00:05:15 <mjrosenb> Funktorsalat: better than it used to be
00:05:17 <Funktorsalat> awwwww http://cmubash.org/kittens/kitten12.jpg
00:05:24 <mjrosenb> Funktorsalat: also, not the one that i was thinking of.
00:05:34 <Funktorsalat> that one is so cute
00:06:31 <Funktorsalat> mjrosenb: what did it use to be?
00:06:42 <sw17ch> kmc: i got my thing working
00:07:39 <mjrosenb> Funktorsalat: goatse
00:07:55 <Funktorsalat> heh. the fourth?
00:08:37 <mjrosenb> Funktorsalat: no clue.  iirc, he would randomly change them around.
00:10:04 <Maxdamantus> Does Haskell specify two-level tail recursion?
00:10:28 <kmc> what?
00:10:29 <Maxdamantus> > let f x = g x; g x = f x in f 4
00:10:30 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: two level tail recursion?
00:10:33 <lambdabot>   mueval-core: Time limit exceeded
00:10:54 <Maxdamantus> Like that.
00:10:59 <kmc> in general compilers don't just optimize tail recursion, they optimize all tail calls
00:11:05 <kmc> and that's tail recursion built out of two tail calls
00:11:05 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: tail recursion is just a simple case of tail calls.
00:11:16 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: what he said^
00:11:19 <kmc> i'm not sure exactly what the Haskell spec requires; you'd have to read it
00:11:25 <Maxdamantus> Ah.
00:11:30 <copumpkin> Maxdamantus: what's the point of that function?
00:11:32 <Maxdamantus> Hm. Haven't thought of it like that.
00:11:40 <copumpkin> Maxdamantus: mutual recursion?
00:11:41 <mjrosenb> i'd be kind of suprised if it specified anything
00:11:51 <Maxdamantus> copumpkin: an example
00:11:52 <kmc> do note that stack in a typical compiled lazy program is fundamentally different from stack in most strict-language compilers
00:12:07 <Maxdamantus> TCO seems to usually be useless in Haskell.
00:12:23 <copumpkin> I wouldn't say that
00:12:24 <Maxdamantus> Other than for implementing some functions from the libraries.
00:12:59 <kmc> i write lots of tail recursive loops
00:13:05 <kmc> you just have to make sure the loop arguments are strict
00:13:18 <kmc> foldl' would not work as a loop if not for TCO
00:13:22 <Maxdamantus> Iterating through lists, maybe.
00:13:25 <sw17ch> jsonv_ d `q_` "data.children[0].data.author" -- where d is http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/.json
00:13:29 <sw17ch> yields 'dons'
00:13:30 <sw17ch> lol
00:13:32 <Maxdamantus> ie, like last
00:13:45 <Maxdamantus> (or foldl')
00:14:06 <mjrosenb> yeah, laziness makes analyizing performance less than intuitive
00:14:18 <mm_freak> Maxdamantus: often you have tail calls, where you would never expect it
00:14:18 <kmc> we expect that «foldl' (+) 0» should take constant space
00:14:25 <copumpkin> I'd say lots of high-performance code uses tail calls a lot
00:14:25 <mjrosenb> then again the switch from imperative to functional has the same effect on most people.
00:14:32 <copumpkin> or rather, relies on efficient tail calls
00:14:33 <mm_freak> remember:  a tail call is not necessarily a recursion
00:14:46 <kmc> mjrosenb, yeah, what's funny is that Haskell has this reputation as *the* functional language, so a lot of people try to tackle it all at once
00:14:55 <kmc> when it's pretty atypical among functional languages
00:15:05 <mm_freak> my whole CPS library would be useless without TCO, even though it doesn't recurse a lot
00:15:34 <mjrosenb> mm_freak: cps in general doesn't make sense without TCO
00:15:50 <kmc> guys what library should i write next
00:16:04 <kmc> what does Haskell really need, that could be accomplished in a few days
00:16:14 <mm_freak> kmc: a cross-platform GUI library, which is /really/ cross-platform
00:16:21 <mm_freak> i.e. even works under windows
00:16:22 <kmc> yeah sounds like a 1 day project ;P
00:16:35 <kmc> mm_freak, first you will need to buy me a windows machine, it must have top of the line 3D graphics support
00:16:39 <kmc> for, uh, compatibility testing
00:17:13 <mm_freak> hmm
00:17:25 <mm_freak> now is haskell not windows-friendly or windows not haskell-friendly?
00:17:33 <mjrosenb> kmc: i had an idea for a parser library
00:17:36 <kmc> hmm let's implement all widgets and everything from scratch in Haskell, and draw to a VNC server
00:17:38 <kmc> that's cross platform
00:17:38 <copumpkin> kmc: a good two-way pickler combinator library
00:17:55 <ivanm> mm_freak: hmmm, would you want a functional widget toolkit rather than just bindings to pre-existing ones?
00:17:56 <kmc> copumpkin, picklers being something like binary or cereal?
00:17:57 <mm_freak> true…  happstack is also a cross-platform GUI library
00:18:01 <kmc> :)
00:18:08 <ivanm> and I woudl say that Haskell is POSIX friendly whereas Windows isn't
00:18:10 <copumpkin> kmc: yeah, except those only specify one way at a time
00:18:14 <kmc> copumpkin, yeah
00:18:21 <kmc> also they don't handle errors well or work with iteratees or whatever
00:18:28 <mjrosenb> kmc: basically with a single parser specification, you should be able to generate a parser, a pretty printer and a context sensitive tab completion engine
00:18:35 <kmc> but i've yet to grok the whole iteratee / enumerator madness
00:18:39 <kmc> mjrosenb, i agree
00:18:40 <mjrosenb> kmc: not that there is anything that would be useful for
00:18:42 <copumpkin> kmc: yeah. newsham had something nice but unpublished, and there's a functional pearl on pickler combinators
00:18:52 <copumpkin> kmc: but still no real library released doing it
00:18:56 <kmc> i think there was some work on attribute grammars that sounds like that mjrosenb
00:18:59 <kmc> ok
00:19:02 <mm_freak> ivanm: i'd love a new toolkit, which accesses the native GUI APIs directly, because the dependence on widget libraries, which are hard to compile yourself under windows, makes writing windows GUIs a PITA
00:19:06 <copumpkin> it's silly to define readers and writers separately for simpel formats
00:19:14 <kmc> yeah
00:19:15 <mjrosenb> mm_freak: sounds like wxwidgets?
00:19:23 <kmc> if your data is a sum of products, it should be picklable automatically
00:19:28 <copumpkin> yeah
00:19:30 <mm_freak> in fact, i've never succeeded to get a single windows GUI to run
00:19:30 <kmc> but we already have TH derivers for Binary etc
00:19:31 <ivanm> mm_freak: but isn't it better to write OS-specific GUIs rather than an "all-in-one" toolkit wrapper?
00:19:31 <copumpkin> Data.Data!
00:19:34 <kmc> ;P
00:19:40 <ivanm> since different OSs have different guidelines
00:19:46 <ivanm> even Qt vs Gtk+ is different
00:19:47 <mjrosenb> mm_freak: i've never succeeded in getting windows to run
00:19:55 <Maxdamantus> wx does all its own layout stuff, doesn't it?
00:19:57 <kmc> scrap your boilerplate! using our 50-ton coal-fueled boilerplate-scrapping machine!
00:20:00 <copumpkin> but if that doesn't appeal to you, I had an idea for a bindingI wanted too
00:20:03 <copumpkin> but forgot what it was now
00:20:05 <mm_freak> mjrosenb: i tried wxwidgets, it even compiled, but wxhaskell didn't
00:20:07 <mjrosenb> mm_freak: keeps complaining about 'not a valid ppc executable' or something like that.
00:20:22 <mm_freak> ivanm: i don't think so…  after all we want to write portable programs
00:20:40 <mm_freak> haskell is so great at portability, as long as you don't try to write a GUI
00:20:43 <kmc> the future of portable programs is the Web
00:20:45 <kmc> like it or not
00:20:55 <kmc> so maybe we need a library or binding for true desktop-feel web apps
00:21:03 <kmc> how well do the existing frameworks handle AJAX?
00:21:09 <mm_freak> mjrosenb: use virtualization…  i don't have a native windows either
00:21:12 <mjrosenb> kmc: haskell -> flash bytecode compiler
00:21:21 <kmc> fuck flash
00:21:22 <Maxdamantus> Flash is dying out.
00:21:22 <kmc> fuck flash so hard
00:21:27 <kmc> Haskell -> HTML5 + Javascript
00:21:34 <Maxdamantus> Haskell -> WebGL shaders
00:21:43 <kmc> though i'm fine with the Haskell server-side, pushing little snippits of JS to the client by AJAX
00:21:43 <mjrosenb> kmc: or haskell -> ios/android
00:21:52 <kmc> mjrosenb, i'm working on Haskell for Android
00:21:59 <ddarius> Someone can make YouOS 2.0
00:22:05 <kmc> it's Nearly Working ™
00:22:09 <kmc> but i'm stuck on some dumb linker shit
00:22:19 <mm_freak> the problem with web apps is that, well, they are in the web =)
00:22:26 <mjrosenb> kmc: sweet.
00:22:39 <mjrosenb> kmc: do you have someone giving you money yet?
00:22:52 <kmc> they will
00:22:54 <kmc> when i finish
00:23:01 <mm_freak> a web app is not only overkill, but probably also very inconvenient as a text editor or even a development environment
00:23:11 <mm_freak> in other words:  from time to time you need to write native GUIs
00:23:20 <mm_freak> and there is nothing you can do about it
00:23:31 * mjrosenb should get a terminal working on my ipod
00:23:35 <kmc> i'll play devil's advocate and say this is only because a) people write bad webapps, and b) people write bad browsers
00:23:36 <Maxdamantus> I think alot of the web standards need to be refactored tbh
00:23:39 <mm_freak> chicken/egg problem:  the browser
00:23:39 <mjrosenb> so i can hugs while i drive
00:24:00 <Maxdamantus> I think something like a JVM with a few libraries might be suitable
00:24:01 <kmc> can you really not make a responsive text editor in a browser, if you have full HTML5 support and no network latency?
00:24:33 <ddarius> People are starting to use web apps for word processing.
00:24:36 <Maxdamantus> (Not the JVM itself though - that's too limiting, afaik)
00:24:37 <ddarius> (and similar tasks)
00:24:45 <mm_freak> kmc: one problem still remains:  a web app is in the web and hence doesn't have access to the local machine, unless you run the server on it, which introduces complexity and security problems, etc.
00:24:54 <mjrosenb> kmc: i know that i have lots of keys bound that i'd also like my web browser to understand, such as ^W
00:25:01 <mm_freak> all that for something as simple as a desktop calculator
00:25:05 <mm_freak> no thanks
00:25:14 <Jafet> Can draw anything and no network latency? That's called X.
00:25:27 <Maxdamantus> but some sort of VM with an minimal API that can be easily adapted to many different languages.
00:25:36 <mjrosenb> mm_freak: well if you put all of your data in the cloud, you don't ever need to have the concept of a 'local machine'
00:25:41 <kmc> Maxdamantus, why is Javascript itself unsuitable as such a VM?
00:25:44 <kmc> well, no TCO for one
00:25:44 <mjrosenb> or at least this is what google wants you to think
00:25:50 <Maxdamantus> kmc: probably.
00:26:15 <mjrosenb> llvm should be the new web standard
00:26:16 <Maxdamantus> It seems like a waste of overhead, using JS as a VM.
00:26:19 <mm_freak> hmm
00:26:34 * hackagebot assembler 0.0.1 - Haskell Assembler  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/assembler-0.0.1 (JeffDouglas)
00:26:39 <mm_freak> anyway, local, native GUIs won't disappear any time soon
00:26:39 <Maxdamantus> Although JS does seem to be very adaptable and could easily work as a VM for many things I can think of.
00:26:46 <mjrosenb> just give a mmaped region that looks like a vga adapter
00:26:58 <mjrosenb> that you can render all of your webpage to
00:27:19 <mm_freak> and that the web is an alternative is a very bad excuse for not having an easy to use widget library for windows
00:27:45 <mm_freak> the real reason is probably that most haskell programmers don't care too much about windows
00:27:55 <kmc> windows can suck it
00:28:25 <kmc> i decided one day to stop using windows, thinking about windows, trying to fix other people's windows, or caring in any way about windows
00:28:30 <kmc> and i have never looked back
00:28:35 <kmc> if i want to play games
00:28:39 <kmc> i discovered this incredible invention
00:28:44 <kmc> it's called a game console
00:28:48 <mm_freak> i wouldn't care, if windows wouldn't have an 80% market share
00:28:49 <kmc> you plug it into your TV, and it just works
00:29:02 <kmc> mm_freak, windows may have an 80% market share but the Web has a 99% market share
00:29:31 <mm_freak> kmc: yes, but that's irrelevant, if you want to write a desktop application, which should be easy to use, easy to install and work offline
00:29:32 <Maxdamantus> Are there any games which actually perform well in a VM?
00:29:48 * Maxdamantus was trying to play Minecraft the other day but couldn't without extreme lag :(
00:29:55 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: there is an nes emulator written in JS.
00:30:01 <kmc> Maxdamantus, sure.  lots of games from the DOS era are as fun as anything published today
00:30:02 * QtPlatypus doesn't have any problem playing minecraft.
00:30:10 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: it runs pretty well in chrome.
00:30:27 <Maxdamantus> mjrosenb: what? The NES emulator, or Minecraft?
00:30:42 <mjrosenb> Maxdamantus: NES emulator
00:30:48 * mjrosenb has never heard of minecraft
00:31:07 <Maxdamantus> Hm. I tried it on two computers.. one of them is this one, which has a partially-fried video card (I have to use SW rendering for everything to avoid extreme distortion)
00:31:13 <mm_freak> kmc: believe it or not, people don't care about ideals…  especially in the commercial world people don't care about your ideals…  they want a working solution and period
00:31:20 <mm_freak> (was that really me just saying that?)
00:31:29 <kmc> err what ideals are you talking about?
00:31:37 <kmc> "the Web has a 99% market share" is not an ideal
00:31:43 <Maxdamantus> and the other was my netbook, with an integrated GMA950.. but it actually runs native games perfectly fine, on reasonably low graphics
00:31:47 <Maxdamantus> like Nexuiz
00:31:51 <kmc> it's a fact which is at this very moment generating enormous piles of money for various people
00:31:54 <mm_freak> kmc: yes, but "web applications are the future" is
00:32:45 <mm_freak> writing a web text editor and not being google don't play well together
00:32:49 <Maxdamantus> I'd think though, that the bad performance probably came from bad design of the renderer in Java.
00:33:15 <Maxdamantus> Maybe it's constantly copying textures from the JVM to the OpenGL module or something.
00:33:29 <kmc> mjrosenb, i'm enjoying cmubash
00:33:37 <ddarius> Maxdamantus: Get a different JRE.
00:34:06 <Maxdamantus> I was using some Sun JRE
00:34:20 <Maxdamantus> Runescape worked fine in it, last I checked.
00:34:52 <mm_freak> besides, current web technologies aren't really ready for 'desktop grade' web applications
00:35:53 <mjrosenb> oh man, runescape
00:36:19 <mjrosenb> if that is the game i am thinking of, it was *awesome* back in 2002
00:36:21 * Maxdamantus used to play it.
00:36:26 <kmc> mjrosenb, funny how despite not going to CMU, those quotes seem familiar ;)
00:37:01 <Maxdamantus> Hm. I think I started in about 2002.
00:37:27 <Maxdamantus> I remember stopping a while before they implemented trading limitations etc
00:37:59 <mjrosenb> kmc: i've gotten that a bunch
00:38:18 <mjrosenb> kmc: also felt that while reading the one for thomas jefferson high school.
00:42:02 * kmc wonders where hellquotes went
00:44:42 <ddarius> There are quotes from TJHS?
00:45:07 <kmc> "I like my women like I like my types: static." - mkehrt
00:47:36 <Maxdamantus> strong?
00:48:12 <ddarius> kmc: That's a little creep.
00:48:17 <ddarius> s/creep/creepy
00:48:21 <kmc> indeed
00:57:23 * ddarius wants a burger but doesn't think any convenient burger places are open now.
00:58:05 <kmc> ddarius, one thing i really miss from New York is 24-hour diners everywhere
00:58:15 <kmc> you could go to Shaw's and buy burger stuffs
00:59:41 <ddarius> kmc: This place goes to sleep pretty early for an urban environment.  What are all the college kids doing anyway?
01:00:19 <kmc> ddarius, i don't know exactly where you are.  you'd probably find some activity around Central Square or BU
01:00:26 <kmc> maybe also Harvard
01:00:38 <kmc> i'm out in sleepy suburbia, though close to Tufts
01:01:26 <jystic> @pl tag' r = do { t <- tag r; return (t, r) }
01:01:26 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 13):
01:01:26 <lambdabot> unexpected "{"
01:01:26 <lambdabot> expecting variable, "(", operator or end of input
01:01:35 <kmc> also the ⊤ does not run all night :/
01:01:44 <jystic> tag' r = tag r >>= \t -> return (t, r)
01:01:49 <jystic> @pl tag' r = tag r >>= \t -> return (t, r)
01:01:50 <lambdabot> tag' = liftM2 (>>=) tag ((return .) . flip (,))
01:02:39 <ddarius> kmc: I'm about midway between Tufts and Harvard, and, yeah, the Tufts area seems pretty residential only.
01:03:11 <ddarius> ("midway" more means equidistant rather than between...)
01:03:29 <kmc> ah.  to which side of the line between the two?
01:03:37 <ddarius> Eas.
01:03:38 <ddarius> t
01:03:45 <kmc> ah, i used to live thereabouts
01:03:58 <ddarius> Yeah, you indirectly mentioned it.
01:07:40 * kmc remembers buying a (very greasy) steak bomb late at night from a place in Central Square that probably also serves (bad) burgers
01:58:42 <imc> hello
02:01:20 <kmc> hi

04:09:15 <McManiaC> hey, can anyone help me installing wxcore on windows? I get this: http://npaste.de/lN/ - but the WXWIN variable *is* set
04:09:33 <McManiaC> can I pass that prefix-flag somehow to that installer?
04:19:01 <siracusa> McManiaC: Are you sure your path in WXWIN is correct? IIRC it has to point to the source directory of wxWidgets.
04:20:52 <McManiaC> siracusa: well what exactly do I need? I thought I'd only need wx-config to make it compile?
04:21:59 <siracusa> I'm not 100% sure, I think you need the source code of wxWidgets
04:22:14 <McManiaC> hmm
04:22:18 <McManiaC> installing it right now :)
04:22:29 <McManiaC> could be a good reason why this isnt working ;)
04:23:01 <siracusa> Unfortunately, I finally failed installing wx on Windows :-(
04:23:52 <McManiaC> ok, next error
04:24:00 <McManiaC> what/where do I get gcc_dll\mswud ?
04:24:00 <McManiaC> :D
04:24:25 <siracusa> Yep, this is where I failed ... :-D
04:25:03 <McManiaC> hm
04:25:08 <McManiaC> sucks
04:25:43 <siracusa> No wait, there was a third problem.
04:26:00 <siracusa> This is the path to the binaries
04:27:59 <siracusa> msw means Microsoft Windows installation, u stands for Unicode, d for debug. Depending on what configuration you choose you have to modify this string.
04:28:49 <elbar> maybe you need an environment variable like this one: WX-CFG=C:\wxWidgets-2.8.11\lib\gcc_dll\mswud
04:28:58 <elbar> not sure tho
04:30:16 <McManiaC> "make -f makefile.gcc" in "c:\wxWidgets\build\msw" will fail with "if not exist ..\..\lib\gcc_dll mkdir ..\..\lib\gcc_dll"
04:30:20 <McManiaC> the directory exists tho...
04:32:35 <McManiaC> I fucking hate building anything on windows
04:32:35 <McManiaC> fuuuuuu
04:32:37 <McManiaC> :<
04:32:55 <Zao> McManiaC: Amusingly enough, only hippie software tends to have issues :D
04:33:04 <mjrosenb> McManiaC: yeah, i highly recommend against it.
04:33:10 <McManiaC> define hippie software?
04:33:26 <mjrosenb> Zao: very few other things *can* be built by end users on windows
04:34:01 <nelson__> Hello everone I'm having a problem importing 'ioErrors' from Control.Exception in one module of a haskell program
04:34:54 <nelson__> the error doesnt seem to come up when i build using the cabal file but when i try to make an object file from one of the files on its own, it claims that Control.Exception isnt exporting ioErrors
04:35:12 <nelson__> what dumb thing am i doing :(
04:35:58 <mjrosenb> nelson__: :browse does not list ioErrors, only ioError.
04:36:44 <nelson__> so is this a thing thats not in Exception anymore or?
04:37:12 <mjrosenb> possibly?
04:37:28 <mjrosenb> i can only speak for what i have installed.
04:37:43 <mjrosenb> it may be that cabal is specifying a different version of the library
04:38:07 <siracusa> @hoogle ioErrors
04:38:07 <lambdabot> Control.OldException ioErrors :: Exception -> Maybe IOError
04:38:13 <nelson__> how can i determine exactly what options it's using?
04:38:56 <siracusa> nelson__: Try using Control.OldException instead of Control.Excepetion.
04:39:30 <nelson__> ill try that now
04:40:34 <nelson__> appears to fix the problem booya
04:41:06 <nelson__> thank you siracusa and mjrosenb :D
04:53:23 <McManiaC> siracusa: I think it builds :)

05:02:39 * hackagebot codepad 0.1 - Submit and retrieve paste output from CodePad.org.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/codepad-0.1 (ChrisDone)
05:05:10 <siracusa> McManiaC: What value did you use for WXCFG? I'm trying it right now, but I get stuck at this point.
05:05:51 <McManiaC> I forgot to add C:\MinGW\libexec\gcc\mingw\4.5.0\ to my %PATH%
05:06:45 <McManiaC> now it's compiling for... hm 10 minutes so far
05:06:45 <McManiaC> :D
05:07:40 <siracusa> Hm, I'm still getting `set the environment variable WXCFG (as in WXCFG=gcc_dll\mswud)'
05:07:56 <McManiaC> did you compile wxwidgets?
05:08:05 <siracusa> Yes
05:08:42 <McManiaC> hm I'm not that far
05:08:43 <McManiaC> :D
05:08:48 <McManiaC> yet
05:08:58 <siracusa> I know I solved that once, but I can't remember how.
05:18:19 <McManiaC> aaaaaaaand its still compiling :>
05:29:40 <cobra> who is an expert on network-bytestring?
05:31:19 <tomberek> hi cobra, sorry, can't say I am
05:31:47 <McManiaC> dont ask to ask just ask
05:35:52 <cobra> well, network-bytestring uses the underlying send and recv system calls, so i am wondering if this means that it bypasses the RTS underlying IO manager
05:40:36 <quicksilver> cobra: yes, it does.
05:41:37 <quicksilver> cobra: I believe it will never block, because GHC always puts sockets into non-blocking mode.
05:43:16 <cobra> quicksilver: i'm pretty sure it's blocking
05:45:48 <McManiaC> siracusa: gcc_mswuddll\monodll_filepickerg.o: could not read symbols: Memory exhausted
05:45:52 <McManiaC> wtf
05:47:10 <siracusa> LOL
05:51:55 <quicksilver> cobra: the send syscall does not block on sockets opened in non-blocking mode.
05:51:59 <tomberek> ivanm: hello?
05:52:05 <quicksilver> cobra: I think GHC opens all sockets non-blocking
05:52:13 <quicksilver> cobra: does your experience not suggest this?
05:53:12 <cobra> quicksilver: i'm actually looking at recv now
05:55:45 <zygoloid> Network.Socket.socket says: "System.Posix.Internals.setNonBlockingFD fd True"
05:56:59 <cobra> This is weird... I'm doing some more tests...
05:59:24 <tcostigl> How does show know how to print the name of a constructor in: data Type = One | Two | Three deriving (Show)
05:59:24 <tcostigl> , in other words, how does a constructor become a string? Is there a constructor type?
06:01:25 <Ke> tcostigl: that's builtin magic
06:01:37 <McManiaC> siracusa: can't get it to build, 3gb ram dont seem to be enough :(
06:02:24 <siracusa> McManiaC: Wow, this is really weird :-S
06:02:44 <McManiaC> http://npaste.de/lO/
06:03:05 <tomberek> McManiaC: are there any gotchas with StandaloneDeriving?
06:03:20 <McManiaC> hm?
06:05:03 <tcostigl> Ke: No fair, can I introspect the name of a constructor, i.e. make a function (Type -> String) that returns the constructor used to create that object (where Type is my type from above)?
06:05:11 <tomberek> in terms of using it in different modules, are there any odd interactions that can break things?
06:05:38 <ivanm> tomberek: I'm kinda around, but not much
06:06:12 <tomberek> ivanm: ok, no prob, just wanted to see if you had any other thoughts
06:06:19 <ivanm> not right now
06:06:30 <ivanm> at least, not about graphs anyway ;-)
06:06:49 <ivanm> tomberek: I am trying to think of how to deal with directed planar graphs though...
06:07:08 <Ke> tcostigl: mostly not, but you can derive show and parse the constructor name from a constant shown
06:08:02 <Ke> though I'm not an expert in haskell internals
06:09:40 <tcostigl> Ke: so that would be internal stuff? there are no library functions to do that? I mostly want to implement show for certain types of (->)
06:10:30 <tomberek> hm, hard
06:10:37 <sipa1024> writing "deriving Show" causes the show function to be generated
06:10:50 <tcostigl> I am coming from ocaml, and I'd like to see for example (+) print as fun: Int -> Int -> Int
06:10:59 <siracusa> McManiaC: Can you try again with --ghc-option=-optl"-Wl,-no-keep-memory" ?
06:11:09 <tcostigl> i guess the Haskell convention is to use :t ?
06:11:12 <Zao> sipa1024: Deriving instances tends to derive instances.
06:11:23 <McManiaC> siracusa: thats a mingw32-make error, nothing to do with ghc yet
06:11:28 <sipa1024> Zao: :)
06:12:01 <siracusa> McManiaC: So it happens when building the wx C lib?
06:12:04 <Zao> The GHC building guide is very particular about ensuring you have a working and sane make binary.
06:12:08 <McManiaC> cpp, yes
06:12:10 <sipa1024> i mean, it's not a library function or default implementation, it's a separate instance, only not one explicitly written in code
06:12:24 <Zao> Ensure that your environment doesn't come with one that suck.
06:12:36 <tcostigl> sipa1024: but how is it generated? I want to see the Haskell code that generates it
06:12:48 <Zao> tcostigl: Dig into the compiler source then?
06:13:47 <sipa1024> tcostigl: i suppose for "data Foo = Bla | Blabla" it would be: instance Show Foo where show Bla = "Bla"; show Blabla = "Blabla"
06:14:54 <tcostigl> So that code is craeted automatically?
06:15:07 <ivanm> if you have a deriving clause, yes
06:15:12 <tomberek> tcostigl: the deriving code is just to reduce boilerplate.  The general rule is that show returns a string, which when read in, would produce the same structure.
06:15:20 <tcostigl> Like, it is a side effect of data/dericing
06:15:27 <ivanm> tcostigl: you won't be able to get (+) printed as Int -> Int -> Int, because for starters that type is too specific ;-)
06:15:52 <sipa1024> "deriving Show" means: produce for me some default instance of the Show class
06:15:53 <ivanm> tcostigl: also, in Haskell, Show is meant to be a primitive serialisation mechanism and Read a primitive deserealisation mechanism
06:15:54 <tcostigl> ivam: lol, yea sorry, thats ocaml
06:16:07 <ivanm> tcostigl: I'm just saying you won't be able to get that in Haskell
06:16:13 <ivanm> or if you did it'd be wrong ;-)
06:16:22 <ivanm> you _might_ be able to get something like that with some TH or something though
06:16:26 <ivanm> or using ghc-lib
06:16:37 <qebab> this is totally the wrong channel for this but I just need to vent about one of my speakers randomly dying. RAAAAOAAHRG. Thanks. :(
06:17:09 <qebab> it worked, I feel a lot better now. Thanks for listening
06:17:21 <ivanm> did someone just say something?
06:17:25 <ivanm> ;-)
06:17:33 <aleator> Silly question, but how should I gnuplot the CSV files from Criterion?
06:18:06 * hackagebot augeas 0.3.1 - A Haskell FFI wrapper for the Augeas API  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/augeas-0.3.1 (JudeNagurney)
06:20:50 <gwern> jaspervdj: pong
06:21:25 <sipa1024> tcostigl: maybe this is something for you: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/4.2.0.2/doc/html/Data-Typeable.html#1
06:21:48 <Maxdamantus> Is the () type meant to be a 0-tuple?
06:22:10 <Jonno_FTW> :t ()
06:22:12 <lambdabot> ()
06:22:12 <Cale> tcostigl: A more general interface for introspection on types and constructors is available via the Typeable and Data classes (which can be magically derived by the compiler -- in fact, it's unsafe that the compiler allows us to write Typeable instances at all)
06:22:21 <copumpkin> Maxdamantus: you can think of it that way
06:22:43 <gwern> Cale, how are you here? You were hear when I went to bed 7 hours ago
06:22:50 <gwern> and I just got up
06:22:52 <Cale> I just woke up
06:23:13 <Cale> > toConstr (Just 5)
06:23:14 <lambdabot>   Just
06:23:29 <Maxdamantus> :t curry
06:23:30 <lambdabot> forall a b c. ((a, b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
06:23:52 <Cale> > constrRep (toConstr (Just 5))
06:23:53 <lambdabot>   AlgConstr 2
06:24:14 <Cale> > constrRep (toConstr Nothing)
06:24:15 <lambdabot>   Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
06:24:15 <lambdabot>    `Data.Data.Data a'
06:24:15 <lambdabot>      a...
06:24:18 <Maxdamantus> :t let add (left, right) = left + right in (curry add)
06:24:18 <Axman6> :t toConstr

06:24:19 <lambdabot> forall a. (Data a) => a -> Constr
06:24:21 <Cale> > constrRep (toConstr (Nothing :: Maybe Integer))
06:24:23 <lambdabot>   AlgConstr 1

06:24:46 <Maxdamantus> Seems to be consistent with the idea of the "curry" function.
06:25:11 <tomberek> good morning Cale
06:25:16 <Cale> g'morning
06:25:24 <tcostigl> Cale, sipa1024: Thanks
06:25:56 <Jonno_FTW> is there a similar function to simpleHTTP that returns a ByteString?
06:25:57 <Cale> tcostigl: The Data.Generics.* libraries provide one answer to doing generic (type-indexed) programming in Haskell
06:26:15 <Cale> tcostigl: They do it via this Data class.
06:26:25 <Cale> :t gfoldl
06:26:27 <lambdabot> forall (c :: * -> *) a. (Data a) => (forall d b. (Data d) => c (d -> b) -> d -> c b) -> (forall g. g -> c g) -> a -> c a
06:26:30 <Cale> heh
06:28:01 <Jonno_FTW> well?
06:28:13 <Jonno_FTW> or would I have to convert the string to bytestring?
06:28:14 <Cale> Jonno_FTW: I'll have a look around for you if you want.
06:28:23 <Cale> Jonno_FTW: You certainly could do that
06:28:55 <Jonno_FTW> I just think it would be inefficient to go String -> ByteString
06:29:11 <Jonno_FTW> basically, I want to download a .gz file, then decompress it
06:29:20 <Cale> The HTTP library is actually older than the ByteString library by a good margin.
06:29:53 <Jonno_FTW> hmm
06:30:15 <Cale> There's the download or download-curl package you could use
06:30:47 <Cale> It'll give you a ByteString to work with.
06:30:53 <Jonno_FTW> nice
06:31:03 <Jonno_FTW> I was using the wget package before
06:33:04 <cobra> quicksilver: I was wrong, it is indeed nonblocking
06:37:47 <Jonno_FTW> what do I do about this: cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
06:37:48 <Jonno_FTW> * Missing header file: download.h
06:41:16 <phenom_> maybe I'm a bit lost but why is [3,2,1] > [2, 10, 100] ?
06:41:40 <phenom_> only because 3 > 2 right ?
06:42:05 <Axman6> @src [] (>)
06:42:06 <lambdabot> Source not found. :(
06:42:12 <Axman6> @src [] compare
06:42:12 <lambdabot> Source not found. Your mind just hasn't been the same since the electro-shock, has it?
06:42:16 <Axman6> bleh
06:42:24 <Jonno_FTW> > [3,2,1] > [2,10,100]
06:42:25 <lambdabot>   True
06:42:28 <Axman6> anyway, it's a lexographic comparison i believe
06:42:44 <Axman6> > [3] > [1,100,204]
06:42:45 <lambdabot>   True
06:42:52 <Axman6> > [1] > [1,100,204]
06:42:53 <lambdabot>   False
06:43:15 <phenom_> so it just iterates untill it finds a condition that is true or false pair-wise through the list
06:43:40 <sipa1024> i would expect it to be lexicographic - are there other options for comparing a list?
06:43:43 <Axman6> > "foo" > "bar"
06:43:45 <lambdabot>   True
06:44:13 <phenom_> hmmm, lexographic ... guess i need to look tha tup
06:44:31 <kstt> Hi ! I have to write a paper for some physisit collegues, and I will need to formalise data types. I don't want to use the Object Oriented notation (aka UML), and I would much prefer to use the usual data notation of Haskell. Does this notation has a know appelation, note particulary related to haskell ?
06:44:59 <sipa1024> phenom_: that's the difficult word for what you're describing... search for the first position for which the elements differ, and compare those
06:45:20 <elbar> > "A" > "a"
06:45:21 <lambdabot>   False
06:46:07 <dom96> How do i use Text.JSON.Generic to parse json into a data type? I get this error http://hpaste.org/40270/textjsongeneric_problem
06:47:49 <McManiaC> siracusa: got wxwidgets to compile :)
06:48:23 <siracusa> How did you fix the memory error?
06:48:30 <McManiaC> upgraded to gcc 4.5.1
06:48:52 <elbar> sounds like cheating to me ;)
06:50:20 <McManiaC> uh, libgmp-10.dll missing
06:50:21 <McManiaC> ^^
06:52:41 <kstt> So, does anyone know what is the generic name for the haskell type notation please ?
06:53:13 <Axman6> the haskell type system? :\
06:53:40 <bezik> hindley-minler?
06:53:50 <spetrea> milner ?
06:55:10 <phenom_> argh! how do you backtick on mac keyboards ?
06:55:25 <tab> copy paste: `
06:55:26 <Saizan> hindley-milner is usually described in pure lambda calculus, without algebraic data types
06:55:45 <McManiaC> :D
06:57:17 <kstt> Saizan: yes, hindley-milner is more related to the polymorphism and the type inference 
06:59:13 <Axman6> phenom_: uh, all normal mac keyboards have backtick in the same place every other keyboard has it, the unshifted tilde, to the left of the 1 key
06:59:35 <copumpkin> Axman6: quit assuming everyone's from the same country ;)
06:59:48 <copumpkin> an italian mac keyboard doesn't even have a backtick on it
06:59:54 <Axman6> then it
07:00:07 <Axman6> it's not a mac keyboard problem, but a layout problem
07:00:48 <copumpkin> preflex: seen notabel
07:00:48 <preflex>  notabel was last seen on #haskell 3 days, 21 hours, 1 minute and 3 seconds ago, saying: yeah, ghc7 is the upcoming release (because it has major new code landing)
07:02:30 <phenom_> Axman6: lol i knoq .. for some reason it doesn't work in terminal (though it does in a regular text editor/ide)
07:04:21 <gwern> hakyll seems to be going well. looks like just a few changes in hakyll and it'd be not too hard to have a wiki work with both hakyll and gitit
07:04:44 <pumpkin> a wiki in hakyll?
07:04:51 <pumpkin> seems kind of counter-hakyll
07:05:07 <gwern> pumpkin: the wiki aspect is for *me*. everyone else gets static
07:05:39 <gwern> seems hakylly to me - let gitit handle interactive editing and versioning, and hakyll focuses on making a nice standalone
07:06:16 <copumpkin> ah :)
07:07:03 <copumpkin> bitrot: man, remind me not to use your code
07:07:46 <bitrot> copumpkin: don't use my code.
07:07:52 <copumpkin> thanks!
07:08:40 * bitrot wonders if the nick joke has passed..
07:08:48 <copumpkin> probably
07:12:17 <Jonno_FTW> how do I get around this problem:
07:12:33 <Jonno_FTW> cabal: Missing dependency on a foreign library:
07:12:34 <Jonno_FTW> * Missing header file: download.h
07:12:46 <Jonno_FTW> even though I downloaded the tarball from hackage
07:15:02 <ManateeLazyCat> Jonno_FTW: You need install C library first.
07:16:16 <Jonno_FTW> but
07:16:21 <Jonno_FTW> it's in a subdirectory
07:16:37 <Jonno_FTW> even using --extra-lib-dirs
07:19:55 <siracusa> Jonno_FTW: For .h files there's --extra-include-dirs
07:20:25 <McManiaC> siracusa: http://npaste.de/lQ/
07:20:27 <McManiaC> :(
07:21:21 <sm> morning gwern.. would you know if gitit has backlinks, aka what links here ?
07:21:49 <sm> I don't see it even on john's wiki
07:22:35 <Jonno_FTW> siracusa: I tried that as well and it didn't work
07:22:50 <Jonno_FTW> C:\temp\download-0.3>cabal install --extra-include-dirs="C:\temp\download-0.3\cb
07:22:54 <Jonno_FTW> its\"
07:23:08 <Jonno_FTW> and I get the same error
07:23:26 <siracusa> McManiaC: Hm, isn't string.h in the standard C++ libraries? Maybe a path problem?
07:26:50 <McManiaC> siracusa: yes indeed
07:27:02 <McManiaC> now I get a "realgcc.exe: Files: No such file or directory" error
07:27:05 <McManiaC> wtf is realgcc
07:27:06 <McManiaC> :>
07:27:07 <gwern> sm: backlinks?
07:27:13 <gwern> sm: no, I don't think anyone has gotten around to that
07:27:40 <gwern> sm: most gitit wikis are small enough you can just grep them
07:28:23 <sm> I see.. I wonder how many gitits are live on the net now
07:28:30 <Jonno_FTW> actually, I change my problem, when I installed with -v3, it found the file but gives a heap of errors/warnings
07:28:32 <gwern> 5-10
07:28:49 * sm is trying to edit darcs wiki and finding it a bit rough
07:29:00 <gwern> sm: part of the problem there is RST
07:29:10 <sm> how's that ?
07:29:12 <gwern> sm: so my first request to the hakyll list is going to be to support .page
07:29:25 <gwern> sm: well, I don't know RST and it seems kind of complex and pandoc doesn't support RST well
07:29:28 <gwern> so,b problems
07:30:03 <McManiaC> siracusa: got around this? http://npaste.de/lR/
07:30:06 <siracusa> McManiaC: I guess after the compilation of wx there comes the "real compilation" :-D
07:30:10 <sm> markdown would be a little easier I agree, but that's not the problem for me.. I have both rst-mode and markdown-mode to help a bit
07:30:17 <gwern> sm: since I don't want to have to throw a 'rename' call into my eventual hakyll script and there's no reason hakyll couldn't support files named foo.page as well as all the other suffixes
07:31:59 <gwern> hm, it seems adding .page was as straightforward as it looked
07:32:02 <sm> my old wiki engine allowed [any case/punct./white space] to link to a page with id AnyCasePunctWhiteSpace.. I miss that!
07:33:04 <siracusa> McManiaC: This looks like C:\Program Files need quotes
07:33:34 <sm> I'm finding renaming a page to be a little bit of a hassle, and the fact that if I edit offline I can't see changes until the patch is accepted upstream who-knows-when. I miss hakyll's instant re-render. Guess I need a local gitit running
07:34:43 <McManiaC> siracusa: lol indeed, but how/where could you put that? :>
07:36:28 <gwern> sm: yeah, that is the usual solution. distributed wiki means you need to run your own :)
07:37:08 <gwern> or you could ask kowey for push
07:37:16 * gwern has push but never uses it
07:37:23 <McManiaC> meh, I'll just reinstall haskell platform to a directory without spaces
07:37:24 <McManiaC> ^^
07:37:48 <gwern> McManiaC: no no, bleed and suffer so the rest of us don't have to!
07:37:53 <gwern> track down those annoying bugs
07:37:58 <McManiaC> :P
07:38:24 <sm> I have it, but definitely need some preview here..
07:38:29 * sm tries a quick cabal install gitit
07:38:33 <gwern> gitit has preview :)
07:39:21 <sm> I need emacs edit + gitit render before push, or preferably before record
07:40:18 <gwern> well, emacs markdown mode hsa a binding to pop up a render in browser
07:41:49 <McManiaC> gwern: if I'd know where to start looking for realgcc
07:41:49 <McManiaC> :>
07:44:57 <sm> gwern: that's a good idea, even though it wouldn't be exact
07:45:06 <sm> I'm sure there's an rst equivalent
07:45:24 <siracusa> McManiaC: The problem seems to be the program calling realgcc by not adding quotes. Can you try -v to get more hints?
07:46:15 <McManiaC> it's actually doing something
07:46:18 <McManiaC> :>
07:46:34 <McManiaC> not yet sure what
07:46:36 <McManiaC> :D
07:47:06 <sm> oof.. linking..
07:48:03 <McManiaC> I did reinstall the haskell platform (to the default path again) and now it seems to be compiling the whole wxwidgets on its own again >.>
07:48:56 <McManiaC> my windows is such a mess :D
07:49:27 <McManiaC> Registering wxcore-0.12.1.6...
07:49:28 <McManiaC> WHAT
07:49:29 <McManiaC> :D
07:51:33 <McManiaC> gee
07:51:35 <siracusa> McManiaC: So does it work now?
07:51:40 <McManiaC> of course it doesnt work
07:51:51 <McManiaC> "Couldn't find wxmsw28ud_gcc_custom.dll"
07:53:25 <gwern> sm: I've noticed the hakyll build seems very serial and not parallel at all
07:54:29 <sm> I rarely build a large number of pages, so haven't noticed
07:56:12 <gwern> well, my wiki has ~100 pages and I', constantly building to try things out...
07:56:23 <McManiaC> siracusa: www.n-sch.de/wx-win.png :)
07:57:19 <chrisdone> gwern: do you think parellizing hakyll's build is feasible?
07:57:33 <siracusa> McManiaC: Great!
07:58:01 <McManiaC> siracusa: wx.exe is 13,5 MB big and requires a 94 MB .dll file :>
07:58:09 <gwern> chrisdone: well, I'm not sure. it seems to me that my pages all depend on a few things - sidebar, footer, logo, but otherwise they are all indepoendent of each oether
07:58:43 <siracusa> McManiaC: Now tell how you achieved this ... :-P
07:59:00 <McManiaC> I dont know
07:59:00 <McManiaC> :D
08:00:04 <gwern> chrisdone: I am not sure that even pages linking each other have any sort of compile dep - hakyll isn't checking for broken links I don't think - it's speculative, it is given a link inside a markdown and pandoc mindlessly renders it
08:00:09 <gwern> if it works, it work
08:02:01 <sm> it's very feasible, but maybe a little trickier if wiki-linking is ever added
08:02:24 <chrisdone> gwern: that was my impression, I haven't checked the internals, but it definitely sounds worth it. personally I don't change my template much so it only ever renders one file at a time, but I can see how it's worth it for your use case
08:02:36 <sm> gwern: getting local gitit running was not bad, but how do I get it to invalidate it's cache and show recorded edits ?
08:02:45 <sm> other than rm -rf cache ?
08:02:50 <gwern> sm: you mean edits you didn't do through gitit?
08:02:53 <gwern> iirc C-R
08:03:07 <sm> right.. shift reload not working, in chrome.. ok
08:03:47 <chrisdone> sm: yeah, you have to delete the cache in options, restart the browser, and then pray that it decides to refresh the cache this time around ... such has been my experience
08:03:51 <gwern> ok! I think I've got it - a wiki that works as hakyll and as gitit
08:04:12 <gwern> all that seems to be broken in hakyll is obviously the intra- and inter-wiki links
08:04:20 <gwern> and I can figure those out later
08:04:27 <chrisdone> you're rendering gitit with hakyll?
08:04:35 <chrisdone> or merging them or something? O_o`/
08:05:04 <sm> I think I'm going to be needing the same thing
08:05:14 <sm> I do, in fact
08:07:26 <gwern>  chrisdone: in practice, I am adding a few files to my Gitit wiki which will make Hakyll understand it. and also asking that hakyll be made smarter
08:09:15 <gwern> I have to say, the hakyll-generated site, using the hakyll site's CSS but tweaked (so articles aren't a nasty narrow column in the middle of a deserted page), looks very nice
08:09:26 <gwern> certainly better than the httrack dump of gitit
08:10:00 * sm nods, and thanks jaspervdj
08:15:08 <jaspervdj> gwern: O hai
08:15:13 <gwern> yo
08:15:18 <gwern> I is finishing email to hakyll
08:15:25 <jaspervdj> Ah, reading it now
08:16:19 <gwern> no, second
08:16:35 <gwern> I really dislike pandoc/xhtml's habit of inserting giant globs of whitespace into everything
08:16:41 <gwern> so unreadable
08:16:59 <ivanm> gwern: yeah, not really pandoc's fault though
08:17:09 * gwern *thinks* it's actually xhtml's fault
08:17:46 <jaspervdj> gwern: I can confirm that
08:18:09 <gwern> (took a look at xhtml but couldn't really figure out where it was coming from)
08:20:03 <gwern> wow. I interwiki to Wikipedia alone 516 times
08:29:09 <gwern> jaspervdj: so, how about those empty links?
08:29:42 <gwern> jaspervdj: oh also, would it be difficult to make the 'build' part parallel?
08:30:25 <jaspervdj> gwern: not at all
08:30:44 <gwern> because with >=120 files, build is not as lickety-split as I'd like
08:30:54 <jaspervdj> gwern: instead of doing something like `forM_ pages render`, you would do something like `forM_ pages $ forkIO render`
08:30:57 <gwern> makes trial-and-error not as good a strategy
08:31:19 * sm is really irked by thunderbird's long-time bug of sometimes showing the first message you click as blank, for ever
08:31:26 <gwern> hm, mapM_ in my case
08:31:48 <sm> gwern, I think you're rebuilding all pages unnecessarily though
08:32:04 <gwern> sm: I have been bitten by stale files and data of all sort
08:32:05 <sm> have you seen hakyll preview ? why not just edit one page and see how it looks
08:32:15 <gwern> sm: *especially* when dealing with new software
08:32:25 <gwern> I do not trust preview, for one
08:32:40 <sm> it's no different from the final rendering
08:33:16 <sm> "hakyll preview" means "re-render each page as I visit it, if it changed"
08:33:57 <jaspervdj> sm: unfortunately, it's not that good :-(
08:34:11 <jaspervdj> sm: it's the same as using build, usually
08:34:19 <sm> (it also has another mode, "re-render each page immediately on save")
08:34:23 <jaspervdj> (a lot faster than rebuild though)
08:34:34 <gwern> I frequently get errors with preview
08:34:36 <d-snp> hey, question as a non-haskell programmer: does Haskell have Sets?
08:34:39 <gwern> yes
08:34:46 <manateeUser> @hoogle Set
08:34:46 <lambdabot> module Data.Set
08:34:47 <lambdabot> Data.Set data Set a
08:34:47 <lambdabot> Network.Browser setAllowBasicAuth :: Bool -> BrowserAction t ()
08:34:58 <monochrom> yes
08:34:59 <gwern> never quite sure if the preview errors are a bad hakyll.hs or a bug like the title bug...
08:35:11 <manateeUser> @hoogle Set a -> a -> Set a
08:35:12 <lambdabot> Data.Set delete :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Set a
08:35:12 <lambdabot> Data.Set insert :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Set a
08:35:12 <lambdabot> Data.Set (\\) :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a -> Set a
08:35:15 <sm> you get a preview error where build succeeds ?
08:35:23 * sm has never, but isn't using the latest stuff
08:36:23 <gwern> sm: soemtimes
08:36:30 <gwern> I stopped using preview a while ago, so not sure
08:36:48 <d-snp> thanks :)
08:37:06 <d-snp> I'm using a functional language without sets, kind of a pain :P
08:37:17 <gwern> jaspervdj: problem with forkIO is that it expects IO (), not Hakyll (). I know liftIO does IO -> Hakyll, but I don't know how to do it the other way
08:37:42 <jaspervdj> gwern: I'll add a forkHakyll utility function
08:37:55 <monochrom> I used an imperative programming language without sets. it is called C.
08:38:01 <gwern> coolies. but empty links are more important!
08:38:08 <jaspervdj> gwern: working on it :-)
08:39:50 <gwern> 'hakyll deploy' sounds like such a terrible idea
08:40:12 <jaspervdj> gwern: I'm not adding it
08:40:20 <jaspervdj> gwern: but custom commands might be nice
08:40:57 <gwern> jaspervdj: yeah. you could pass into 'hakyll' a Map String (String->Hakyll ()), I guess
08:41:47 <d-snp> > Set :: fromList [1,2]
08:41:48 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `,'
08:42:10 <d-snp> > Set :: fromList 1 : 2 : []
08:42:11 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `:'
08:42:22 <gwern> d-snp: no, that's not right at all ;)
08:42:27 <d-snp> damnit :P
08:42:48 <gwern> d-snp: first, because 'Set' uses so many common names, in lambdabot. you must prefix with S.
08:42:55 <gwern> this is good practice and common in regular haskell
08:43:24 <gwern> so it'd look more like > S.fromList [1,2]
08:43:36 <d-snp> ah
08:44:02 <d-snp> ah that worked, thanks :)
08:44:21 <gwern> whereas if you wanted Data.Map, it'd look more like > M.fromList [1,2]
08:44:22 <gwern> etc
08:44:26 <gwern> qualified names
08:45:32 <d-snp> ok cool
08:46:05 <d-snp> wasn't haskell object oriented?
08:46:12 <monochrom> yes
08:46:13 <aristid> no
08:46:19 <sipa1024> haha
08:46:20 <d-snp> :P
08:46:33 <monochrom> haskell is both object oriented and morphism oriented
08:47:00 <sm> jaspervdj: gwern also hit the obscure tail error you get when title-block's delimiters are wrong (eg, mismatched)
08:47:59 <d-snp> ok, wouldn't this be more logical? > map (+1) (toSet [1,2,1])
08:48:02 <magicman> Iteratee tutorials are the new Monad tutorials.
08:48:15 * magicman goes back to #lurk.
08:48:23 <d-snp> where map would be a method on a Set object?
08:48:38 <d-snp> hmm
08:48:38 <gwern> > S.fromSet $ S.map (+1) $ S.toSet [1,2,1]
08:48:39 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `S.fromSet'Not in scope: `S.toSet'
08:48:40 * sm thinks hakyll deploy (or hakyll push) sounds quite nice, details aside
08:48:42 <gwern> oh well
08:48:54 <sipa1024> d-snp: unfortunately map is already a function which is defined on lists in the prelude
08:49:05 <gwern> d-snp: specifically, Set ought to implement the Functor typeclass which would let you fmap (+1), yes
08:49:11 <d-snp> sipa1024: I know, but why can't it deduce which map to use from the parameters?
08:49:11 <gwern> d-snp: ought, being the operative word
08:49:41 <monochrom> It is not called "toSet" but rather "fromList" so that you can just change what you import if you want to use someone else's set lib.
08:49:43 <sipa1024> d-snp: it works differently
08:49:49 <gwern> oops
08:50:06 <gwern> > S.toList $ S.map (+1) $ S.fromList [1,2,1]
08:50:08 <lambdabot>   [2,3]
08:50:12 <gwern> tada!
08:50:18 <sipa1024> the core elements are functions, and they can be polymorphic, but a single name corresponds to a single function still
08:50:25 <gwern> d-snp: note the duplicates drop out, but you knew that already
08:50:28 <d-snp> gwern: yes but there you had to say S.map
08:50:33 <d-snp> gwern: yeah that was the point :)
08:51:23 <gwern> our standard libraries are not perfect, we know that :(
08:51:51 <d-snp> so.. haskell would be able to deduce which map to use, if the stl would be better written?
08:52:11 <gwern> well, strictly speaking the Functor method is named *fmap*
08:52:19 <d-snp> aha
08:52:26 <d-snp> I'll google on haskell functor then :P
08:52:42 <gwern> I wouldn't want ghc to go around saying 'hey, the type doesn't match, I'll just throw in any function that will work - oh, looks like unsafePerformIO works!'
08:53:01 <d-snp> lol
08:53:17 <d-snp> unsafe is a type too isn't it?
08:54:15 <roconnor> gwern: coq does this
08:54:16 <gwern> d-snp: well, the point is that unsafePerformIO lets you do 'a -> b', so if there is any type mismatch ever...
08:54:54 <roconnor> whether you can write unsafeCoerce with unsafePerformIO is implementation dependent
08:55:14 <gwern> yes, well, coq is special...
08:55:29 <roconnor> it just as a list of registerd coerecions
08:55:33 <d-snp> gwern: yes ok but unsafeperformIO is called unsafePerformIO so you would never call it when you mean to call a generic map
08:55:43 <roconnor> I don't see why it wouldn't work in something like Haskell
08:58:25 <jaspervdj> gwern: You have mail
08:58:57 <gwern> said jaspervdj in his dulcet tones
08:59:25 <jaspervdj> gwern: It's probably not the solution you were hoping for, but it'll do ;-)
08:59:34 <gwern> jaspervdj: I don't actually understand your solution
08:59:55 <gwern> hakyll is making pandoc render all sorts of stuff with various options; what's ignorant about that?
09:00:11 <jaspervdj> gwern: Well, to hakyll, HTML is just a "String"
09:00:33 <jaspervdj> you could run regexes on it to solve this problem, but I think the JS solution is better
09:01:23 <gwern> hm. where would I put this JS? template.html?
09:01:39 <jaspervdj> gwern: Yep, somewhere at the bottom
09:01:56 <jaspervdj> gwern: and put <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js"></script>
09:01:59 <gwern> I guess that's not *too* bad
09:02:01 <jaspervdj> somewhere in the <ead>
09:02:05 <jaspervdj> *<head>
09:02:09 <gwern> I would have liked a more static solution, one that would work in elinks
09:03:11 <gwern> but at least editing template.html won't break gitit
09:04:26 <jaspervdj> gwern: You could also write a String -> String function which changes the links, and then plug it into hakyll.hs
09:04:45 <jaspervdj> gwern: You could do this using (1) regexes (2) the pandoc api
09:05:40 <jaspervdj> ...the pandoc api would actually be the best solution, but it won't be *trivial*
09:08:53 <jaspervdj> gwern: Wait, I have an elegant solution
09:10:07 <gwern> jaspervdj: I think the pandoc api is probably how gitit does it
09:11:37 <gwern> convertWikiLinks ∷  Inline →  Inline                                                                                                                                             
09:11:42 <gwern> convertWikiLinks (Link ref ("", "")) =   Link ref (inlinesToURL ref, "Go to wiki page")                                                                                          
09:11:45 <gwern> convertWikiLinks x = x   
09:13:35 <jaspervdj> yeah
09:14:02 <gwern> inlinesToUrl basically seems to strip out formatting and turn "Front Page" into "Front%20Page" and that sort of thing
09:15:13 <jaspervdj> http://hpaste.org/40274/processing_links
09:15:27 <jaspervdj> ↑ the changeLinks function is String → String
09:15:38 <jaspervdj> you can add that to your render chain somewhere
09:21:26 <jaspervdj> gwern: http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/reference/Text-Hakyll-ContextManipulations.html
09:21:32 <jaspervdj> gwern: Use the renderBody function
09:21:47 <gwern> ok
09:22:30 * gwern just is trying to figure out where. never fear, I'll figure it out sooner or later
09:23:44 <dsdeiz> hm, what's usually being developed using haskell? :D
09:24:20 <copumpkin> dsdeiz: ivory tower planning software
09:24:25 <quicksilver> computer programs.
09:24:27 <copumpkin> we need to figure out how to manage it and how to build new ones
09:27:10 <roconnor> > 2^4
09:27:12 <lambdabot>   16
09:27:51 <quicksilver> > 4^2
09:27:52 <lambdabot>   16
09:27:55 <quicksilver> ...wow, eerie.
09:28:02 <moosefish> dsdeiz: I tend to use haskell for point solutions -- carefully planted plugins that do stuff that's just too much of a PITA to do in anything else.
09:28:20 <roconnor> quicksilver: ^ is commutative just like + and * are
09:28:25 <quicksilver> roconnor: must be.
09:28:31 <moosefish> (parsing comes to mind. Go go parsec)
09:28:32 <sipa1024> so it would seem
09:28:42 <quicksilver> roconnor: I baked you a proof, but I ated it.
09:29:00 <roconnor> quicksilver: oh it is clear by induction
09:29:24 <roconnor> + is commutative, * is iterated plus and it is commutative, ^ is iterated *, so it is commutative too
09:29:38 <dsdeiz> that seems like very complicated.. what would u guys recommend to create as a start in both haskell and functional programming (for first-timers)? 
09:30:07 <moosefish> dsdeiz: I got started by going through the cool-sounding problems in Project Euler
09:30:24 <moosefish> small, self-contained, and if you pick carefully you can explore one or two features of the language at a time
09:30:52 <quicksilver> the disadvantage of project euler is that they're math exercises not programming exercises
09:30:58 <quicksilver> and you might or might not find that interesting.
09:31:07 <moosefish> entirely true; but it worked for me.
09:31:30 <dsdeiz> moosefish: that's interesting! i'll start with that one. thanks!
09:32:02 <moosefish> on the flip side, I tend to use Haskell for stuff that has a heavy math bias. Well-defined problems that have few to little external library dependencies, or needs to interact deeply with the OS
09:34:54 <gwern> jaspervdj: so I am using chainRender http://hpaste.org/40275/hakyllhs but chainRender doesn't seem to take a renderBody's HakyllAction Context Context. should I copy renderChain's definition and inline the renderBody to it?
09:35:24 <monochrom> don't create anything. just do exercises in books or tutorials. if you find insufficient exercises, mutate the examples as exercises.
09:35:29 <McManiaC> siracusa: www.n-sch.de/wx-err1.png & www.n-sch.de/wx-err2.png :(
09:36:46 <monochrom> if your mother tongue is a european language, you don't learn chinese by "diving in" and "what essay do I write on for learning chinese?". not in the first month.
09:36:49 <moosefish> of course, I also ended up reading through the OO Haskell paper to congeal everything in a reasonable mess of thought patterns. I'm insane that way
09:37:36 <monochrom> "diving in" works only when your mother tongue is a european language and you use it to learn another european language.
09:37:45 <dsdeiz> yeah, good point.. will start with exercises too.
09:38:44 <monochrom> tryhaskell.org is a whole sequence of exercises. interactive too.
09:39:08 <siracusa> McManiaC: The second one looks strange.
09:39:09 <monochrom> after tryhaskell.org, you can meaningfully talk about small projects.
09:40:49 <jaspervdj> gwern: use something like: render' templates = renderChain templates . (>>> renderBody changeLinks) . withSidebar . createPage
09:41:38 <gwern> oh, arrows. no wonder I wasn't getting anywhere
09:41:51 <dsdeiz> gotcha! i'll finish learnyouahaskell first then proceed to tryhaskell :D
09:42:00 <monochrom> \∩/
09:43:21 <McManiaC> siracusa: indeed ;)
09:44:45 <gwern> chrisdone: in practice, I am adding a few files to my Gitit wiki which will make Hakyll understand it. and also asking that hakyll be made smarter
09:44:57 <chrisdone> where's the new haskell site again?
09:45:18 <chrisdone> gwern: ah, ok
09:45:18 <gwern> jaspervdj: after remembering to include a ++".html" in there, it seems to work
09:46:06 <siracusa> McManiaC: Someone else already had this problem: http://www.mail-archive.com/wxhaskell-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00685.html The solution was to reinstall wxWidgets :-)
09:46:15 <McManiaC> meeeeeeh
09:46:15 <McManiaC> :D
09:46:21 <McManiaC> not again
09:47:20 <McManiaC> siracusa: but wx is really nice: http://npaste.de/lS/
09:47:21 <McManiaC> :)
09:47:36 <chrisdone> (ah, found it: http://new-www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)
09:47:50 <HugoDaniel> im in love with haskell
09:48:11 <McManiaC> HugoDaniel: <3
09:48:12 <McManiaC> :D
09:48:18 <HugoDaniel> im a codeossexual
09:48:19 <chrisdone> @faq Can you make a house wife out of Haskell?
09:48:19 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
09:48:23 <gwern> jaspervdj: and actually, I guess this answers my interwiki question as well. if convertWikilinks can rewrite empty links, it can rewrite the interwiki links aswell
09:48:36 <gwern> I didn't expect to wind up with such a big hakyll.hs, but if it works...
09:49:09 <gwern> jaspervdj: so, how goes forkHakyll? :)
09:49:27 <jaspervdj> gwern: coming up :-)
09:49:49 <jaspervdj> it's not that hard to write actually, I'll to it first
09:50:50 <chrisdone> jaspervdj: hey, nice work on the formlets port -- looking forward to see what you do with a rewrite
09:51:08 <chrisdone> gonna go clean up the Web articles on the haskellwiki, bbl
09:51:49 <gwern> current hakyll: http://hpaste.org/paste/40275/working#p40276
09:53:23 <HugoDaniel> how do i upload my stuff to hackage ?
09:54:33 <gwern> cabal upload is easy
09:55:32 <jaspervdj> HugoDaniel: use cabal sdist, then cabal upload the result
09:56:24 <gwern> http://hpaste.org/paste/40275/interwikis_working_too#p40277 yay
09:58:03 <sm> nice!
09:59:25 <gwern> oh, and hakyll preview crashes on me
09:59:40 <gwern> after I do a build, and then hakyll preview: hakyll.hs: _cache/pages/An Abortion Dialogue.page: hGetContents: invalid argument (Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character)
10:01:45 <jaspervdj> gwern: Hmm, strange
10:01:58 <gwern> hm, even if I clean then preview: hakyll.hs: _cache/pages/An Abortion Dialogue.page: hGetContents: invalid argument (Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character)
10:01:59 <copumpkin> byorgey: I love that paper
10:02:07 <gwern> must be something funny in that file
10:02:08 <jaspervdj> gwern: build workd fine?
10:02:13 <gwern> oh yes
10:02:34 <jaspervdj> gwern: try inspecting the file with `od -c`?
10:02:49 <jaspervdj> hmm, no, never mind, it's a cache file
10:02:56 <jaspervdj> it wouldn't make sense anyway
10:02:59 <gwern> I can see the matrix!
10:03:52 <jaspervdj> gwern: hmm, the fork action is not that simple
10:03:53 <gwern> there is a french phrase in it elan vital with the little unicode bit
10:04:00 <gwern> maybe that's the issue
10:04:07 <gwern> your build uses unicode-clean IO but not preview
10:04:18 <jaspervdj> you have to pause your main thread until the others finish
10:05:27 <gwern> well, that's no surprise
10:05:42 <gwern> I think the usual solution is to return a mvar and block on them
10:05:56 <jaspervdj> yeah, I guess that's up to the user
10:05:58 <Raghs> can I call R with Haskell?
10:06:15 <gwern> I was afraid you were going to say 'no, there are tons of data dependencies which mean you have to build one after another!'
10:06:24 <siracusa> Jonno_FTW: Where you able to solve the missing .h file problem?
10:06:36 <gwern> Raghs: probably. but calling interpreters isn't as easy as calling compiled languages, or so I hear
10:06:39 <siracusa> * Were
10:07:01 <Raghs> makes sense
10:07:20 <jaspervdj> gwern: how about the more higher level signature forkHakyll :: [Hakyll ()] -> Hakyll () which executes the given actions in parallel and waits?
10:07:45 <gwern> jaspervdj: I don't mind. if you want to do the blocking plumbing in hakyll, that's cool
10:08:01 <gwern> if it's a problem it can be investigated later, or you could provide a forkSingleHakyll or something
10:08:48 <gwern> personally, I would offer 3 functions. a forkHakyll that returns a mvar you can wait on, a forkHakyll that immediately discards the mvar and looks like regular forkIO returning IO (), and then your list forkHakyll which waits on all mvars
10:09:35 <sm> gwern: the multibyte error could be the one given by all GHC 6.12 executables encountering non-ascii I/O with no system locale configured.. try export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 first
10:10:09 <gwern> that *is* my lang
10:11:13 <sm> possibly hakyll preview is running a shell command and not inheriting that ? just a thought
10:11:42 <sm> or I guess that file could be misencoded, but then why would build work
10:13:56 <gwern> hm. I emptied out the offending file, and preview just errored out at the next file
10:14:04 <DevHC> perl: easy things are easy, hard things are possible
10:14:14 <DevHC> haskell: hard things are easy, the impossible has just happened
10:14:18 <DevHC> IND33D, OMFG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:14:25 <DevHC> ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
10:14:32 <DevHC> (GHC version 6.10.4 for i386-unknown-freebsd):
10:14:41 <DevHC> RegAllocLinear.getStackSlotFor: out of stack slots, try -fregs-graph
10:15:28 <jaspervdj> gwern: strange
10:15:36 <jaspervdj> gwern: can I checkout the code somewhere?
10:15:53 <c_wraith> DevHC: try 6.12.3?
10:15:59 <DevHC> S00N(TM)
10:16:06 <gwern> well... I need to clean it up now that I have a working website and push it all to my backup repo on c.h.o
10:16:12 <c_wraith> 7.0.1 will be out Soon(TM). :)
10:16:23 <gwern> jaspervdj: so maybe in a few dozen minutes
10:16:35 <gwern> jaspervdj: thoughts about my triplet for fork?
10:16:45 <DevHC> well notably i have:
10:16:49 <DevHC> x :: Integer
10:16:57 <DevHC> x = 019238490238949823747237589178347258973249858934757398475345235...
10:17:09 <c_wraith> how many k is that line? :)
10:17:13 <DevHC> 5
10:17:15 <c_wraith> nice.
10:17:25 <c_wraith> I think 6.12 might handle that more gracefully
10:17:27 <gwern> jaspervdj: oh, I've been running hakyll.hs via runhaskell. is it possible the preview issue is due to that?
10:20:24 <xplat> DevHC: now that's what i call an integer
10:20:35 <jaspervdj> gwern: perhaps, try compiling it?
10:22:09 <gwern> 1500 patches in my wiki. it's true what they say, a tool encourages its own use

10:25:28 <HugoDaniel> has anyone here used quickcheck for their code ?
10:26:17 <gwern> sproingie: I was musing about how sticking 2 or 3 files into gitit grew into >100 files and 1500 patches
10:26:32 <gwern> HugoDaniel: I have!
10:26:49 <HugoDaniel> gwern: do you like it ?
10:26:55 <gwern> I suppose so
10:27:02 <HugoDaniel> have you used hunit ?
10:27:07 <gwern> never
10:27:21 <HugoDaniel> hmm
10:27:22 <sproingie> gwern: kinda got a stone soup thing going on
10:27:26 <jaspervdj> HugoDaniel: use test-framework, it allows you to use both in a nice way
10:27:27 <sproingie> i really need to try gitit sometime
10:27:33 <HugoDaniel> ahh
10:27:35 <HugoDaniel> nice jaspervdj
10:27:42 <gwern> jaspervdj: so you don't think people would use a forkHayll returning Hakyll () very much/
10:27:46 <sproingie> tried it on my vps host but ghc no likey 256M RAM
10:27:51 <sproingie> (actually gnu ld no likey)
10:27:58 <jaspervdj> HugoDaniel: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/test-framework
10:28:02 <zygoloid> gwern: what's the trick for getting people to contribute to the stone soup?
10:28:12 <HugoDaniel> im familiar with unit testing, though i have never used hunit, but quickcheck has a mysterious feel to it
10:28:14 * zygoloid has always sucked at that part
10:28:14 <gwern> zygoloid: people? I have no idea. I'm just talking about myself
10:28:34 <zygoloid> oh, i see. well. yeah. /that/ i can do ;)
10:28:48 <gwern> HugoDaniel: the hardest part for me with quickcheck is its generatin random values. it's great if your functions are about Ints or whatever but if you have custom datatypes... I tend to get confused
10:28:49 <zygoloid> still, that's an impressive project size
10:29:15 <HugoDaniel> gwern: i see
10:29:16 <jaspervdj> gwern: ping me next time I'm on, I have to go
10:29:19 <gwern> jaspervdj: is formM needed?
10:29:33 <gwern> jaspervdj: couldn't you just recusse down the list waiting?
10:29:34 <HugoDaniel> im gonna read the quickcheck chapter on rwh
10:29:44 <gwern> jaspervdj: but I'll try it now and email the list if it breaks or something
10:29:47 <jaspervdj> gwern: forM > manual recursion :-)
10:30:05 <jaspervdj> gwern: You might have to partition the list into, say, parts of 32 files
10:30:09 <HugoDaniel> another question about hackage...
10:30:17 <jaspervdj> there is a maximum on open file handles iirc
10:30:22 <jaspervdj> anyway, bye
10:30:22 <gwern> jaspervdj: oh, ok. I misunderstood form then

10:30:48 <kschadt> Newbie Haskell user with a question: What's the function that let's you map out a string as a list of characters? I know that's what it is in the first place, but I don't know how to make it read like that
10:30:50 <gwern> finally
10:31:06 <gwern> kschadt: ? a string is a list of characters. [Char] == String
10:31:09 <Twey> kschadt: id ;)
10:31:32 <gwern> > ['f','o','o'] == "foo"
10:31:33 <c_wraith> kschadt, you mean to print it?
10:31:33 <lambdabot>   True
10:31:49 <kschadt> actually, nvm
10:31:53 <c_wraith> > map show "foo"
10:31:55 <lambdabot>   ["'f'","'o'","'o'"]
10:33:39 <c_wraith> > text $ '[' : intercalate "," (map show "foo bar") ++ "]"
10:33:43 <lambdabot>   mueval-core: Time limit exceeded
10:34:07 <c_wraith> time limit exceeded? >_>
10:34:21 <gwern> security, performance <--- choose 1
10:34:43 <c_wraith> I often choose both, at the cost of the user understanding how to use it. :)
10:34:46 <HugoDaniel> cool
10:34:54 <HugoDaniel> now i have a hackage username
10:35:01 <HugoDaniel> maybe i should change my nick to it
10:35:05 <gwern> hm. I guess with lambdabot  it'd be 'security, performance, usability <-- choose 2'
10:35:41 <c_wraith> But really, there's no infinite loop in that.  Nor even a large loop.  how did it exceed the time limit?
10:35:57 <gwern> 'text' might be slow
10:36:02 <c_wraith> Not that slow
10:36:04 <gwern> it's easy to blow the timelimit with CReal as well
10:36:07 <c_wraith> > text "this is a string"
10:36:09 <lambdabot>   this is a string
10:36:11 <gwern> maybe you just got unluck as well
10:36:14 <mauke> > text $ '[' : intercalate "," (map show "foo bar") ++ "]"
10:36:15 <lambdabot>   ['f','o','o',' ','b','a','r']
10:36:25 <c_wraith> yep.  just bad luck
10:36:50 <sm> sproingie: that's why we're looking into hakyll as an alternate renderer for gitit content.. no heavy memory use
10:38:11 <gwern> and darcs can't be slow if the history functionality isn't there at all
10:38:39 <gwern> (I wonder why hakyll seems to recompile pandoc on every install)
10:47:23 <gwern> oh dear. this hakyll concurrency seems to have slowed things down
10:48:29 <gwern> *much* slower
10:48:33 <gwern> weird
10:59:12 <sproingie> sm: the memory use of gitit was something i couldn't even experience, because the memory use of linking anything nontrivial with ghc is too much for my vps
10:59:25 <sm> ahh
10:59:37 <gwern> hahah, oh man, it's still running
10:59:40 <sproingie> the alternative was to compile everything from the outside and upload it, and frankly that was too much of a pain
10:59:49 <sm> and you have no similar machine to link offline I guess
11:00:16 <sproingie> semi-similar, but not convenient for syncing up with due to firewall issues
11:00:54 <sproingie> i could work around them but its a high hurdle when i just want to tinker and play around
11:00:58 <gwern> so, it went from ~30s to... 14m when I killed it
11:01:02 <gwern> performance fail :)

11:36:52 <roconnor> let a = [1;2;3];; let b = [1;2;3];; a == b        
11:36:53 <roconnor> false!
11:38:05 <Botje> haskell isnt much better:
11:38:08 <Botje> > 'a' == 'b'
11:38:10 <lambdabot>   False
11:38:11 <Botje> *ducks*
11:38:14 <roconnor> :O
11:39:02 <dolio> Iteratee tutorials amuse me.
11:39:36 <dolio> "Lazy I/O is causing problems. We could write our functions in IO, instead, or, we could use iteratees... and end up with code that looks almost identical to the IO code."
11:39:38 <dolio> :)
11:40:12 <mak__> roconnor, isn't == address equality?
11:40:20 <roconnor> mak__: ah
11:40:43 <magicman> One thing I'd like to know about iteratees and such, is how well they play with the "usual" functions.
11:40:45 <dolio> Why isn't it called reallyUnsafePtrEquality#, then?
11:40:53 <sproingie> i don't know anything that implements == as address equality.  == is whatever the implementation in Eq says it is
11:41:00 <sproingie> er in the Eq instance
11:41:16 <sproingie> (oh was that about ocaml?)
11:41:18 <dolio> sproingie: This is in an OCaml context.
11:41:27 <sproingie> yay for no overloading
11:41:28 <magicman> I mean... "length . words" is the way to count the amount of words. Using that with readFile, or getContents, or whatever other lazy IO thing seems rather straightforward.
11:41:32 <roconnor> mak__: thanks
11:41:40 <mak__> np
11:41:51 <magicman> Could I still use "length . words" in an iteratee-setting, or would I have to write iteratee-specific length/words functions?
11:42:01 <dolio> magicman: The latter, I think.
11:42:09 <Twey> Really?
11:42:17 <Twey> I think you should be able to lift the existing functions.
11:42:17 <copumpkin> roconnor: ooh, that comment about the platform burns :P
11:42:19 <sproingie> is there an easy way to turn an enumerator back into a list?
11:42:46 <roconnor> copumpkin: people need to focus on the postive: Hackage and cabal
11:43:27 <magicman> If you can turn an enumerator into a list, it'd have to be an IO-list, because you need to keep the file around you're reading from (in this case).
11:43:29 <Twey> dolio: Whazzat?  Iteratee code tends to be pretty terse and nice.
11:43:44 <Twey> At least, the calling code — the implementation can get a little hairy.
11:44:00 <jmcarthur> what comment about the platform?
11:44:28 <jmcarthur> oh i bet on reddit
11:44:34 <dolio> Twey: I'm sure you could lift words and length into iteratees, but I doubt you'd get the nice interleaving behavior that you'd want out of getContents or an iteratee-specific version of those functions.
11:45:00 <Twey> I don't think you can interleave length . words
11:45:24 <magicman> Yeah, not that, just words, though? That should interleave just fine...
11:45:25 <dolio> Read a word, add 1 to your accumulator, discard the word, repeat.
11:45:29 <Twey> Oh, you mean GC'ing the list behind you?
11:45:49 <Twey> Hmm
11:45:55 <Twey> I don't know.
11:46:07 <magicman> Well, that would be the case anyway. More the "reading from the file when needed".
11:46:43 <magicman> "take 2 . words" on lazy-IO (is buggy, I know) but wouldn't read more than 2 words from the file. Or a chunk big enough to have those two words.
11:47:07 <magicman> At least... that's my understanding?
11:47:11 <dolio> Right.
11:50:16 <roconnor> heh, wikipedia cite email as an example of something without a (vendor) lock-in.
11:50:36 <roconnor> while it is true that there is no vedor lock-in due to open standards, there is certainaly a protocol lock-in
11:50:49 <roconnor> which is why we can't have secure email
11:50:52 <EvanR-work> heh "lazy IO is buggy"
11:51:47 <roconnor> why is "take 2 . words" on lazy-IO buggy?
11:51:55 <sproingie> ESMTP has negotiation mechanisms that should allow one to upgrade to better transports
11:52:05 <c_wraith> roconnor, it doesn't close the file handle?
11:52:11 <sproingie> i dont think the protocol is the failing here, it's the lack of compelling alternatives
11:52:29 <roconnor> sproingie: surely there are compelling alternatives
11:52:39 <roconnor> c_wraith: oh
11:52:57 <magicman> Aye, c_wraith mentioned what I was thinking of.
11:53:05 <sproingie> none that anyone wants to accept.  oh not ssl, that will chew up my mail servers precious cpu
11:53:41 <sproingie> etc.  the stakeholders are notoriously resistant to change
11:53:55 <roconnor> sproingie: some sort of authentication would presumably lower the load on mail servers
11:54:06 <sproingie> pfft, already baked in
11:54:06 <roconnor> sproingie: but here networks effects are in play
11:54:22 <roconnor> sproingie: then why is my spam full of meaningless headers?
11:54:50 <sproingie> because smtp doesn't look at headers
11:55:07 * jmcarthur should try to kick the alt-stdlib project back into gear some time
11:55:23 <jmcarthur> but maybe with a slightly different focus
11:55:41 <sproingie> might be new technical solutions available, might be some that are extant, but the biggest problem in the system is the people
11:55:49 <roconnor> sproingie: what sort of authentication is done then?
11:55:55 <sproingie> get rid of humans and we're all set
11:56:00 <sproingie> roconnor: smtp auth
11:56:22 <jmcarthur> i would like to see about making the ghc infrastructure independent of the standard library so we can experiment with alternatives more freely. i don't know how feasible that would be though
11:56:46 <jmcarthur> at least some of the GHC primitives could be more loosely coupled with the standard library or something maybe
11:58:14 <roconnor> sproingie: this doesn't seem to stop people from sending email that is claims to be from me
11:58:48 <sproingie> well SPF is there, if people dont deploy it, there's no technical fix for that

12:06:46 <cobra> is the HTTP library maintainer 10 feet away from anyone?
12:07:07 <dolio> That one's an easy fix, too.
12:08:07 <nooodl> cobra, what if he was
12:08:29 <dolio> HTTP needs to be updated for GHC 7 as well.
12:08:54 <cobra> I found a bug in HTTP
12:09:38 <copumpkin> how many things _do_ build for GHC 7? it'd be nice to have an automated program that tries most of hackage
12:09:45 <copumpkin> it seems like a lot of people do it in an ad-hoc manner
12:09:53 <copumpkin> for libraries changes
12:10:03 <lucca> doesn't hackage do that already?
12:10:13 <dolio> I thought dons had some kind of regression test.
12:10:21 <lucca> hm, no it just tracks results.
12:10:43 <Gracenotes> build reports that cabal generates does have compiler+version
12:11:18 <lucca> need someone to submit cabal build reports for some sort of cabal-emerge type operation on ghc7 to hackage then.
12:12:56 <hydo> I must be the only one still running into packages that aren't updated for 6.10/12 yet.
12:13:26 <dolio> Heh.
12:14:14 <dolio> Technically all the base 3 dependent packages aren't fully on board with 6.12 (and .10, I think). It just isn't fatal.
12:14:20 <dolio> And there are quite a few of those out there.
12:15:14 <hydo> Yea, I've seen that, but this error was.  Though, as I remember, it was due to constraints on the require... or something.  It's been a week or so.  I guess it wasn't very fair to say that since I can't recall any details.
12:28:28 <cobra> I also noticed that a lot of packages on hackage have a restriction base < 4.13 and need to be updated for ghc 7
12:29:26 <roconnor> cobra: this is the design of cabal's broken versioning model
12:31:15 <dancor> http://hpaste.org/40278/why_does_binary_read_file_stay#locked
12:31:18 * hackagebot wordsearch 1.0.1 - A word search solver library and executable  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wordsearch-1.0.1 (ByronJohnson)
12:31:46 <Saizan> base < 4.13?
12:33:18 <Saizan> dancor: decode might not be forcing the whole bytestring? or maybe B.S.L.readFile doesn't guarantee that the handle gets closed on EOF
12:33:30 <gwern> roconnor: I suppose if you had your way we'd all be still using makefiles/
12:33:32 <Saizan> dancor: which version of bytestring?
12:34:08 <dancor> Saizan: bytestring-0.9.1.7
12:35:01 <roconnor> gwern: more or less.  Hopefully something more scalable than Make.
12:35:48 <roconnor> gwern: I guess nix is effectively Make.
12:37:19 <Saizan> dancor: ah, ok, there was a bug where hGetContents didn't hClose the Handle in old versions of bytestring, but that was fixed
12:38:20 <Saizan> gwern, roconnor: a more appropriate comparison would be with configure scripts
12:38:28 <aristid> roconnor: i read in some slides from dons that cabal will move towards a nixos model. or is that unlikely to actually happen?
12:38:29 <sproingie> aieeeee
12:38:41 <Saizan> autoconf style ones do it quite differently
12:38:53 <sproingie> autoconf is heinous
12:39:18 <dancor> Saizan: it works if i just have lazy bytestrings and don't use binary.  but it seems odd that forcing the binary value wouldn't force the underlying bytestring.  do they leave a trailing \n at the end for fun or something
12:39:55 <Saizan> dancor: dunno, check the instance
12:40:26 <roconnor> aristid: I don't know.  It would be good if it does.  I'm not sure why they don't just use nix itself though.
12:41:02 <roconnor> gwern: now that I think about it, if I had it my way all software would be fully specified with dependently typed interfaces
12:41:17 <dolio> roconnor: You ever had any urge to make use of dependent union types?
12:41:34 <roconnor> what's a dependent union type?
12:41:50 <dolio> It's like a sigma, but the first part is blind.
12:41:54 <cobra> where can i read about the new Control.Exception.mask function?
12:42:10 <dancor> the binary file ends in 'i'; there's no way to correctly print hi without reading the entire file
12:42:13 <roconnor> dolio: you cannot project out the first component?
12:42:25 <copumpkin> dolio: that sounds weird
12:42:32 <gwern> roconnor: I'd be frightened of an all-dep type os
12:42:33 <dolio> That'd be the idea.
12:42:56 <dancor> but maybe the file isn't closed until you try to read _beyond_ the last char
12:42:56 <gwern> dependent types are new enough I'm suspicious that there are probably still horrible problems, especially from a million-lines-of-code perspective
12:42:58 <copumpkin> dolio: so the type of the second component depends on the value of the first, but you can't observe the value of the first? but you can observe the value of the second?
12:43:03 <roconnor> dolio: My limited understanding is that the information hiding features of this are destroyed in the presence of strong dependent sums.
12:43:05 <dolio> It's the dual of dependent intersection, which is a Pi parametric in the argument, more or less.
12:43:26 <dolio> roconnor: Not with a sufficiently fancy type system.
12:43:52 <roconnor> dolio: I haven't seen this, but yes, I'd be interested in this feature if it is possible to have.
12:44:32 <dolio> roconnor: Do you have any simple examples? The only one that I could think of is an inductive-recursive formulation of ordinal numbers, which I think is way too complex.
12:44:37 <Saizan> dancor: sounds possible
12:45:24 <roconnor> dolio: any Abstract Data Type will do
12:45:27 <roconnor> dolio: a stack
12:45:47 <dolio> copumpkin: Effectively, you can only eliminate a dependent union with a dependent intersection. So Ex A T has eliminator with type {A : Set} {T : A -> Set} {P : Ex A T -> Set} -> (.(x : A) -> (w : T x) -> P (x, w)) -> (p : Ex A T) -> P p.
12:45:56 <dolio> copumpkin: To use the agda notation.
12:46:08 <dolio> roconnor: Ah, yeah, there's that aspect, too.
12:46:45 <dolio> roconnor: I was thinking more along the lines of where you want the union of a family T i, without being able to observe the indexes as with {i : I | T i}.
12:47:49 <dolio> For instance, because you might have T i = T j, or one a subset of the other, but don't want distinct elements (i, x) and (j, x).
12:48:51 <dolio> (Actually, maybe {i : I & T i} is the right notation, I forget.)
12:49:26 <copumpkin> mm
12:49:29 <dancor> i can't decide if it's more ugly to use rnf with binary or convert strict bytestrings to lazy ones for it
12:50:37 <roconnor> dolio: yes, the standard model of set theory is like this
12:50:45 <dancor> maybe if i use rnf at the end i could still get some benefit from the intermediate laziness
12:50:49 <dancor> (or maybe the opposite..)
12:51:11 <roconnor> Inductive Ens : Type :=
12:51:12 <roconnor>     sup : forall A : Type, (A -> Ens) -> Ens.
12:51:22 <roconnor> dolio: ^^
12:51:30 <dolio> Oh, right.
12:51:46 <roconnor> let me try to think of something less outragous
12:51:52 <dolio> No, that's good.
12:52:19 <roconnor> oh ok
12:52:28 <dolio> Because, it also gives me a chance to talk about defining an inductive-recursive universe in-lieu of quantifying over type.
12:52:48 <dolio> And then the blind quantification actually does additional work of not allowing you to examine the index type.
12:52:58 <dolio> I think.
12:53:39 <dolio> copumpkin: If you think of something Haskell-like, existential quantification is this kind of blind sum.
12:53:47 <copumpkin> yeah
12:53:59 <copumpkin> I think koninkje_away called it a weak sigma at some point?
12:54:07 <dolio> Yes.
12:54:10 <roconnor> ya, I'd call it a weak sigma
12:54:13 <roconnor> or a weak existential
12:54:33 <roconnor> nowaday I might prefer the term weak sigma
12:54:57 <dolio> They are, in a sense, also the dependent-type extension of binary intersection and union.
12:55:07 <dolio> Same as Pi and Sigma are the extensions of binary product and sum.
12:55:17 <roconnor> I've never heard of a weak Pi before though
13:02:45 <cobra> can forkIO ever fail?
13:05:16 <kmc> probably
13:05:19 <c_wraith> cobra: probably not in a recoverably manner
13:05:36 <kmc> exhausting stack / system resource limits is kind of universal
13:06:04 <kmc> the Concurrent Haskell paper allows that forkIO would create a new OS thread, and there could be a limit on those
13:06:15 <kmc> in GHC it does not always create a new OS thread; i'm not sure if it ever does
13:08:36 <Cale> It never fails in any way that your program could reasonably do much about.
13:10:18 <c_wraith> I mean, if forkIO runs out of memory, it's very likely that attempting to print an error message about it will, too
13:16:38 <maurer_> c_wraith: forkIO is usually requesting more memory than a print
13:22:08 <sproingie> forkOS creates an OS thread, forkIO uses whatever the runtime already has allocated
13:22:12 <sproingie> is that about right?
13:22:41 <sproingie> perhaps s/has allocated/allows/
13:22:46 <monochrom> weakly about, not strongly about
13:24:25 <sproingie> so if the runtime has a spare thread in its pool, forkIO might use a separate thread, right?
13:24:29 <monochrom> let x,y be distinct real threads. an unbound thread may sometimes be run in x, sometimes be run in y. a bound thread, if assigned to x, will not be moved to y.
13:24:48 <mauke> forkOS doesn't create bound threads
13:25:05 <monochrom> and IIRC there may be a million bound threads all assigned to x.
13:25:36 <sproingie> documentation for forkOS suggests that's exactly what forkos does
13:25:47 <kmc> forkOS might create an OS thread, but probably doesn't
13:25:49 <kmc> it creates a bound thread
13:26:11 <mauke> then your definition of bound thread is wrong
13:26:13 <kmc> the only difference between forkIO and forkOS is that FFI calls from a forkOS thread will appear to come from the same OS thread
13:26:16 <kmc> can we put that in the topic?
13:26:30 <sproingie> oh so it may still share it with other bound threads?
13:26:45 <kmc> think so
13:26:58 <kmc> if you compile without -threaded then there is only one OS thread yes?
13:27:00 <sproingie> so it's basically about thread affinity
13:27:06 <kmc> and this still fulfills the contract
13:27:33 <kmc> it's for interfacing with foreign libs that aren't thread-safe, have thread-local state, etc
13:28:01 <sproingie> makes sense now
13:52:18 <chrisdone> what do you think of this? http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Web
13:52:30 <chrisdone> have I Gone Too Far?
13:54:47 <djahandarie> I think it's nice
13:56:01 <djahandarie> I still don't like the whole mailing-list deal
13:56:06 <djahandarie> It feels so out-of-date
13:58:27 <djahandarie> Igloo, were more individuals ever nominated for the h.org committee?
13:59:06 <Igloo> djahandarie: Yes
14:00:32 * djahandarie nominates himself! I lurk on IRC a lot. :-)
14:01:40 <chrisdone> Igloo: do you know what the status is on getting http://new-www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell live?
14:02:34 <copumpkin> it'd be nice to be able to submit comments to whoever's working on that, like we did with mtnviewmark about the new haddock style
14:04:38 <chrisdone> copumpkin: yeah, it's hard to know where it's at, feed their back, etc
14:04:45 <chrisdone> nominolo: ping?
14:05:59 <Igloo> The style is nominolo's, if that's what you mean
14:06:28 <Igloo> The new server will be made live as soon we can manage it
14:08:51 <chrisdone> ah, I was wondering if nominolo was still working on the design aspects
14:12:23 <chrisdone> Igloo: I appreciate your effort in sorting things like this out :-)
14:24:32 <knobo> is there a function (a -> [a]) ?
14:25:13 <gwern> @hoogle a -> [a]
14:25:14 <lambdabot> Prelude repeat :: a -> [a]
14:25:14 <lambdabot> Data.List repeat :: a -> [a]
14:25:14 <lambdabot> Prelude iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
14:25:18 <gwern> knobo: yes
14:25:39 <sipa1024> knobo: what do you want the function to do?
14:26:44 <knobo> Yes, I think my question was to general.. I want to take a character 'x' and make it a string "x".
14:27:31 <monochrom> > ['x']
14:27:32 <lambdabot>   "x"
14:28:15 <monochrom> it doesn't have a standard name.
14:28:24 <knobo> monochrom: but how can I do liftM [] (Just 'x'), and get Just "x" ?
14:28:54 <sm> sure it does, listify = (:[])
14:28:58 <dolio> Its standard name is "return".
14:29:16 <dolio> > return 'x' :: String
14:29:17 <lambdabot>   "x"
14:29:19 <sm> bah dolio
14:29:24 <monochrom> > liftM (:[]) 'x'
14:29:25 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `m a1'
14:29:25 <lambdabot>         against inferred type `GHC.Type...
14:29:30 <dolio> > pure 'x' :: String
14:29:31 <sm> my name was awesome and destines for the std. libs
14:29:31 <monochrom> > liftM (:[]) (Just 'x')
14:29:31 <lambdabot>   "x"
14:29:33 <lambdabot>   Just "x"
14:29:46 <knobo> (:[]) is the trix
14:29:50 <knobo> thanks
14:31:03 * knobo learning Haskell and parsec at once
14:31:23 <sm> that's how I started!
14:31:34 <waterlaz> > pl \n -> (sum.dividers) n == n
14:31:35 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `\'
14:31:42 <waterlaz> > pl /n -> (sum.dividers) n == n
14:31:43 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `->'
14:31:52 <waterlaz> wait...
14:31:53 <sm> parsec continues to undermine haskell's success avoidance
14:32:13 <knobo> sm: what do you mean?
14:32:37 <sm> knobo: there's an unofficial slogan in the haskell world, "avoid success"
14:32:44 <waterlaz> @ pl \n -> (sum.dividers) n == n
14:32:50 <waterlaz> > @ pl \n -> (sum.dividers) n == n
14:32:51 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `@'
14:33:02 <knobo> ?!
14:33:02 <lambdabot> Maybe you meant: . ? @ v
14:33:10 <knobo> sm: why?
14:33:32 <waterlaz> @pl \n -> (sum.dividers) n == n
14:33:32 <lambdabot> (==) =<< sum . dividers
14:33:36 <sm> some page out there will explain all the details, it's nothing to worry about. Basically, the longer you can stay under the radar with a new language, the more chance you have to get it right
14:33:37 <knobo> but, then I understand the phrase
14:35:23 <waterlaz> @pl \x -> x+1
14:35:24 <lambdabot> (1 +)
14:36:10 <sm> we like to joke about it, and smugly imagine that we are failing (to avoid success). Parsec is partly to blame.
14:36:14 <knobo> Aha.. not to fall in the lisp trap :) "Lisp is the best language on earth, you *must* use it" and people complains that it's different, and everybody just hears the complains.
14:36:41 <Operator23> When attempting to compile I'm getting errors that don't seem to reference my program.
14:36:45 <b4taylor> I'll take scheme over lisp any day.
14:36:45 <Operator23> http://pastebin.com/BKdSA2va
14:36:50 <b4taylor> Any.
14:36:58 <Operator23> Everything works fine in ghci...
14:37:26 <waterlaz> @pl \n -> (sum (dividers n)) == n
14:37:26 <lambdabot> (==) =<< sum . dividers
14:37:31 <knobo> btw, I prefer lisp in most cases. Maybe until I learned Haskell ;)
14:37:31 <waterlaz> wth?
14:37:40 <waterlaz> even the type doesn't match
14:38:07 <monochrom> ghc --make your_file.hs
14:38:17 <waterlaz> @pl (\n -> ((sum (dividers n)) == n))
14:38:18 <lambdabot> (==) =<< sum . dividers
14:38:39 <Operator23> monochrom: Ah, thank you. What's the difference?
14:38:50 <waterlaz> pl looks broken =(
14:39:15 <monochrom> the error is a linker error. without --make means ghc assumes you explicitly name libs to be linked in.
14:39:24 <waterlaz> @unpl (==) =<< sum . dividers
14:39:25 <lambdabot> (\ c -> (sum >>= (==)) (dividers c))
14:39:26 <Operator23> monochrom: Gotcha. Thanks.
14:45:19 <orbitz> Lots of functional programming legends here today, I hope imperative terrorists dont' strike
14:46:24 <orbitz> copumpkin: Are you at ICFP?
14:48:18 <copumpkin> orbitz: I wish :)
14:48:29 <orbitz> copumpkin: dam you
14:49:14 <orbitz> copumpkin: i wanted to get taht glass of scotch with you for once!
14:50:32 <aristid> orbitz: you are?
14:50:38 <orbitz> Yes
14:50:41 <orbitz> just the CUFP portion
14:50:51 <aristid> orbitz: i suspect you secretly are an imperative terrorist.
14:50:56 <orbitz> ssssh
14:51:06 <orbitz> You'll never know as i mutate my internal state often
14:51:32 <aristid> orbitz: also you're making almost no orthography mistakes today. how comes?
14:52:20 <orbitz> I've been caught
14:52:21 * orbitz runs
14:54:47 * sproingie runs after orbitz lazily
14:54:51 <sproingie> i'll catch you when you come back
14:55:25 * chrisdone picks up a rock and hurls it like Hurlcules and watches it slowly approach orbitz in the distance
14:55:37 <chrisdone> thud!
14:57:30 <waterlaz> damn... what've they done to hpaste?
14:57:41 <waterlaz> it's unusable crap now
14:57:45 <orbitz> chrisdone: are you here?
14:58:02 <ehamberg> waterlaz: http://chrisdone.com/posts/2010-09-15-hpaste-update.html
14:58:04 <chrisdone> orbitz: I don't know, now that you ask. am I?
14:58:23 * orbitz looks around for someone with a rock in the room
14:58:28 <orbitz> well..you aren't *here*
14:58:56 <chrisdone> orbitz: just wait. I threw it really hard
14:59:01 <orbitz> Ocaml seems pretty well represented here
14:59:08 <orbitz> chrisdone: did you throw it eagerly too?
14:59:19 <waterlaz> ehamberg, anyway the old one was nice and actually usable as a paster for code
14:59:31 <waterlaz> the new one is a toy, no more, no less
14:59:39 <dolio> I don't see how the new one isn't.
14:59:44 * ehamberg never noticed the difference
14:59:46 <chrisdone> orbitz: let's just say there'll be a thunk coming your way
14:59:59 <orbitz> i should be safe as long as i don't evaluate it!
14:59:59 <waterlaz> this design does not serve the main purpose
15:00:29 <copumpkin> orbitz: damn! now I really regret not being there :)
15:00:32 <waterlaz> show the syntaxe colored code
15:00:53 <copumpkin> waterlaz: um
15:00:55 <orbitz> copumpkin: you fool!
15:00:58 <chrisdone> waterlaz: I see that you did as hlint told you, in your own, charming way:
15:00:58 <chrisdone> http://hpaste.org/40282/perfect
15:00:58 <chrisdone> http://hpaste.org/40283/perfect
15:00:58 <chrisdone> http://hpaste.org/40284/perfect
15:01:15 <copumpkin> waterlaz: that's really constructive
15:01:47 <monochrom> let's just all be friendly and agree with waterlaz and move on to a more interesting conversation
15:01:54 <waterlaz> =)
15:02:14 <copumpkin> waterlaz: if you have specific objections, why not just give them to the creator of the new hpaste, who happens to be right here
15:02:15 <monochrom> life is really too short for arguing against whiners
15:02:22 <copumpkin> waterlaz: otherwise, "quit bitchin"
15:02:37 <ddarius> chrisdone: Does anyone ever check the "Expire in an hour?" box?
15:02:44 <chrisdone> ddarius: indeed
15:02:44 <monochrom> I do.
15:03:00 <copumpkin> if I'm pasting impossible missions for tom cruise
15:03:02 <copumpkin> I use it
15:03:04 <waterlaz> but seriously... there has to be a way to show someone the source without the buttons and other things around
15:03:07 <monochrom> I use the expire box all the time
15:03:11 <waterlaz> ok, I'm back to using sprunge
15:03:20 <knobo> is there a built-in function (\x _ -> x)?
15:03:36 <ddarius> const
15:03:40 <ddarius> @pl \x _ -> x
15:03:40 <lambdabot> const
15:03:45 <monochrom> hehe
15:03:49 <ddarius> :t \x _ -> x
15:03:50 <lambdabot> forall t t1. t -> t1 -> t
15:04:02 <Ke> @src const
15:04:02 <lambdabot> const x _ = x
15:04:14 <monochrom> waterlaz: use http://erkie.github.com/ to help shoot down the buttons
15:04:36 <chrisdone> monochrom: oh great thanks for destroying what little productivity I'd just mustered
15:04:44 <monochrom> hahaha
15:04:48 <waterlaz> monochrom, thanks but I think i'd realy go with sprunge
15:05:34 <copumpkin> <_< http://snapplr.com/3fnd
15:07:51 <ddarius> monochrom: That thing is ingenious.
15:08:49 <ddarius> copumpkin: I guess to actually use CartesianClosed requires a proof that C is a category so this record bundles the two together for convenience.
15:09:12 <copumpkin> yeah, I was just trying to think of good naming for things
15:09:23 <copumpkin> C, CC, and CCC seem to fail
15:09:36 <copumpkin> but I can't think of better ones that don't get a mile long
15:10:11 <sm> HA that rocks :)
15:10:27 <ddarius> CCC is fine, C is probably fine as well, though you could use 'category' as well.  CC is probably not the best name.
15:10:51 <ddarius> copumpkin: What does ⊔ do?
15:10:58 <copumpkin> least upper bound of universe levels
15:11:13 <ddarius> Okay, that's what I thought.
15:11:38 <monochrom> class (CC c) => CCC c where {...}; class (CCC c) => CCCC c where {...}; class (CCCC c) => CCCCC c where {...}; ...
15:11:49 <copumpkin> lol
15:11:58 <ddarius> copumpkin: Depending on the scoping/qualification conventions of Agda, you might have CC just be 'proof'.
15:12:01 <knobo> Is it possible top lift a tuple constructor on to a monad so that Just 
15:12:10 <copumpkin> ddarius: that could work, hmm
15:12:23 <copumpkin> C is a fairly standard way of referring to the category in this library, so I'll stick to that
15:12:30 <copumpkin> but maybe I'll just call it proof
15:12:39 <knobo> liftM2 something (Just 'a') (Just "b") becomes Just ('a', "b")?
15:12:56 <chrisdone> :t liftM2 (,)
15:12:57 <lambdabot> forall a1 a2 (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => m a1 -> m a2 -> m (a1, a2)
15:12:57 <ddarius> copumpkin: Yeah, C is fine (until you start using multiple categories then things get a little counter-intuitive.)
15:12:59 <monochrom> > liftM2 (,) (Just 'a') (Just "b")
15:13:00 <lambdabot>   Just ('a',"b")
15:13:17 <copumpkin> ddarius: yeah, the agda module system allows you to rename things or disambiguate in those cases
15:14:10 <ddarius> copumpkin: That should be adequate then.
15:15:13 <knobo> Can I rely on the lazyness of haskell when it comes to monads?
15:15:17 <zackham> how do i define a function multiple times with different argument patterns in ghci? (in a file i can do it on multiple lines... not sure how to do this in ghci and im hanging out in the console learning)
15:15:42 <aristid> zackham: with ;
15:15:58 <zackham> aristid: is there a name for that or a better way of phrasing that? thanks btw
15:16:00 <Twey> let f 1 = 2; f 2 = 5; f 6 = 9; f x = x * 2
15:16:04 <ddarius> knobo: Monads are just an interface.  A particular monad is just an implementation of that interface.
15:16:14 <knobo> so that (\x _ -> x) this-parser-will-be-called this-parser-will-not-be-called?
15:16:30 <Twey> (const)
15:16:41 <knobo> Twey: yes, that's right.
15:17:02 <Twey> Nothing will be called if it isn't needed.
15:17:31 <Twey> What interfaces the value supports (monad, arrow, functor) is immaterial.
15:17:40 <knobo> If this works.... Then... I... fall in love..
15:19:35 <roconnor> @type runState 
15:19:37 <lambdabot> forall s a. State s a -> s -> (a, s)
15:20:25 <roconnor> > runState (do { x <- get; set undefined; set (x+1)}) 7
15:20:26 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `set'Not in scope: `set'
15:20:35 <roconnor> > runState (do { x <- get; put undefined; put (x+1)}) 7
15:20:37 <lambdabot>   ((),8)
15:27:01 <knobo> the "do" notation ensures that things are evaluated in order always?
15:27:10 <sipa1024> no
15:27:23 <sipa1024> it is simply syntactic sugar for monadic binds
15:27:46 <sipa1024> do { x <- get; put undefined; put (x+1) }
15:27:48 <sproingie> monads are commonly used for sequencing, but that's not their only purpose
15:27:53 <sipa1024> is exactly the same as
15:27:57 <copumpkin> knobo: it ensures effects occur in order
15:28:04 <copumpkin> knobo: I wouldn't say "things are evaluated in order" though
15:28:19 <sipa1024> get >>= \x -> put undefined >> put (x+1)
15:28:29 <sipa1024> (excluding some parenthesis, maybe)
15:28:31 <knobo> so do x <- foo\n\t y <- bar\n\t return $ const foo   -- is bar evaluated here?
15:28:58 <sipa1024> yes
15:29:11 <conal> knobo: depends on which monad, but almost certainly yes.
15:29:18 <Cale> If that action is executed
15:29:25 <Cale> and foo finishes
15:29:32 <conal> good point
15:29:37 <sipa1024> true, it may depend
15:29:49 <sipa1024> eg in the maybe monad, and foo already returned nothing
15:29:54 <knobo> sorry, I wrote wrong
15:29:57 <copumpkin> preflex: seen stevan
15:29:57 <preflex>  stevan was last seen on #haskell 176 days, 8 hours, 1 minute and 43 seconds ago, saying: ... thought about this before... thanks.
15:30:11 <knobo> do x <- foo\n\t y <- bar\n\t return $ const x y
15:30:23 <knobo> bar is always evaluated?
15:30:44 <conal> "do" makes Monad & monads easier to use but harder to understand.
15:31:02 <Cale> (Note, it's generally a bad idea to actually put tab characters in your source.)
15:31:05 <sipa1024> knobo: it is up to the monad implementation to decide that
15:31:20 <Cale> You can also write that as  do x <- foo; y <- bar; return $ const x y
15:31:24 <c_wraith> I actually don't know of any monad implementation that fully evaluates that, necessarily
15:31:36 <knobo> Cale: great!
15:31:51 <sipa1024> if you would write
15:32:29 <sipa1024> do x <- foo; y <- return bar; return x
15:32:29 <Cale> I know the \t was probably just for IRC, but you should ensure that your text editor will convert tabs to spaces anyway :)
15:32:58 <knobo> Cale: I use haskell-mode in emacs
15:33:04 <c_wraith> I mean, if bar :: m [X], and it's an infinite list...  well, what do you mean by "evaluate bar"?
15:33:38 <c_wraith> let's say, for example, bar = return [1..]
15:33:50 <Cale> The natural definition of "evaluate" is "to weak head normal form" :)
15:34:18 <c_wraith> most monads evaluate somewhat in >>=, but the extent is variable
15:34:25 <kmc> knobo, monads and "do" are not about enforcing evaluation order
15:34:30 <Cale> return should never be a strict function, since it'll break the monad law that return a >>= f = f a
15:34:35 <kmc> they are about inventing a new concept, "execution order", which is not tied to evaluation order
15:34:48 <sipa1024> spot on
15:34:50 <kmc> so that we don't need to worry about evaluation order even when performing effects
15:35:06 <kmc> (not that all monads are about "effects", either, but if you stretch the term "effect" far enough it seems to cover most of them)
15:35:13 <sipa1024> evaluation order is something that is only influenced by strictness
15:35:31 <kmc> at the Core level, evaluation order is simply determined by the use of "case"
15:35:47 <kmc> it's a little more complicated at the Haskell level, since a variety of constructs can desugar to "case" (and "case" doesn't always desugar to "case")
15:36:02 <Cale> Haskell technically doesn't have a specific evaluation order.
15:36:32 <Cale> It has nonstrict semantics, which means that the termination behaviour and results of programs should be the same as if they're being lazily evaluated.
15:36:49 <Cale> and in practice, lazy evaluation is a pretty good approximation to what compilers do
15:37:01 <Cale> But it's not exactly always what happens.
15:37:21 <knobo> Ok, so: do x <- parseX; y <- parseY; return $ const x y  will never execute the parseY function?
15:37:26 <sipa1024> knobo: so, you could say that do is syntactic sugar for writing a sequence of actions (where 'action' should be seen very general), but how that sequence is evaluated at run-time is a completely other thing
15:37:38 <kmc> knobo, parseY is not a function there
15:37:40 <Cale> knobo: No, it'll *usually* execute parseY
15:37:45 <copumpkin> is it possible to have a "partial" product in a category of only some objects? or does the definition of product mean that given any two (or more) objects, you can form a product of them?
15:37:50 <Cale> and yeah, parseY is probably not a function
15:37:54 <kmc> a function is something whose type has the form (A → B)
15:37:56 <Cale> (though it could be)
15:38:10 <Funktorsalat> > trace "1" 1 + trace "2" 2
15:38:11 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `trace'Not in scope: `trace'
15:38:13 <Cale> > (do x <- id; y <- reverse; z <- map toUpper; return (x,y,z)) "hello"
15:38:15 <lambdabot>   ("hello","olleh","HELLO")
15:38:17 <kmc> if you write "y <- parseY" then parseY must have type (M B) for some monad M
15:38:18 <knobo> Ok. I need some sleep
15:38:18 <Funktorsalat> seems to do the left one first every time
15:38:23 <copumpkin> the term "all binary products" seems to suggest that there are cases in which you might only have some 
15:38:33 <Funktorsalat> not contradicting you, you said it's up to the compiler of course :)
15:38:53 <Cale> knobo: But of course, it depends on whether parseX "finishes normally", whatever that means in the given monad.
15:38:54 <kmc> it seems that most programmers have a vague operational definition of "function"... but Haskell is very precise, a function is anything whose type is built with (→), and they all have exactly one argument
15:39:07 <aavogt> replacing + with seq could still evaluate the right one first, interestingly enough
15:39:17 <Cale> knobo: It's really hard to talk about the specifics of evaluation without picking a specific monad.
15:39:29 <Funktorsalat> copumpkin: the definition of products is in terms of the whole category...
15:39:42 <Funktorsalat> though you could keep that quantification and still have only some products
15:39:52 <copumpkin> Funktorsalat: so when people talk about a category having "all binary products"
15:39:55 <copumpkin> or "all finite products"
15:40:02 <copumpkin> what does that say above having products?
15:40:03 <knobo> I think I'll understand it when I wake up. I'm on the edge now :)
15:40:09 <knobo> good night
15:40:10 <monochrom> when you write your monad, you can write >>= to do very funny things
15:40:16 <knobo> and thank you
15:40:25 <Cale> copumpkin: It doesn't say much about whether infinite products are available. They may or may not be.
15:40:37 <copumpkin> Cale: yeah, I don't mean that way
15:41:07 <copumpkin> hmm
15:41:32 <cobra> SpecConstr  Function `$j_X2m3{v} [lid]' has two call patterns, but the limit is 1
15:41:36 <Funktorsalat> copumpkin: I think what I said was a red herring
15:41:38 <copumpkin> Cale: http://snapplr.com/2x2p
15:41:47 <cobra> what does that compiler message mean?
15:41:48 <knobo> monochrom: I was hoping for an example before I went to bed :)
15:41:50 <copumpkin> "Any two objects X and Y of C have a product X×Y in C."
15:41:56 <Cale> copumpkin: right
15:42:05 <Funktorsalat> "all finite products" is equivalent to "all binary products, and a terminal object" btw
15:42:16 <monochrom> Control.Monad.State.Lazy and Control.Monad.State.Strict are examples
15:42:19 <knobo> About funny things with bind
15:42:30 <mm_freak> > (,,) <$> id <*> reverse <*> map toUpper $ "hello"
15:42:31 <lambdabot>   ("hello","olleh","HELLO")
15:42:43 <copumpkin> Cale: does that means you could have a category of n >> 2 objects, with let's say only one product in it?
15:42:58 <Cale> copumpkin: Yep.
15:43:07 <copumpkin> that's what I thought
15:43:10 <Cale> Well, one product of, say, two objects.
15:43:10 <monochrom> the empty category satisfies "Any two objects X and Y of C have a product X×Y in C"
15:43:13 <copumpkin> yeah
15:43:40 <copumpkin> Cale: but it's conceivable for there to exist objects in the category that do not "partake in any products", despite the category having some products?
15:43:44 <Cale> Every object is the product of just itself.
15:43:51 <copumpkin> *binary products
15:43:52 <Cale> But apart from that, yes.
15:44:20 <copumpkin> so having said that, would you say that http://snapplr.com/712q is overly specific?
15:44:49 <copumpkin> Obj is an object of the category over which the product is defined
15:45:02 <Cale> copumpkin: Well, maybe the intention there is to define a functorial 
15:45:18 <Cale> (Maybe not)
15:45:43 <Cale> What is the weird looking l thing?
15:45:46 <copumpkin> Cale: well, the module is just called Category.Product, so I'd expect it to be more general
15:45:56 <copumpkin> ?
15:46:08 <Cale> Set (o \sqcup \ell) ?
15:46:12 <copumpkin> oh
15:46:20 <copumpkin> least upper bound on universe levels :P
15:46:34 <copumpkin> man, that really stands out :) ddarius asked the same thing earlier
15:47:03 <Cale> It looks strange typographically, since it's kind of smallish compared to the other letters.
15:47:10 <copumpkin> oh yeah, my emacs font is horrid
15:47:25 <copumpkin> the older version was much prettier
15:47:35 <copumpkin> not sure what went wrong
15:47:45 <Funktorsalat> copumpkin: a pair of objects which doesn't have a product may still "partake in products" as part of the definition of the products which do exist...
15:47:59 <Cale> See, this thing here is defining an operation 
15:48:03 <Cale> on objects
15:48:04 <Funktorsalat> ("for all objects o, ....")
15:48:07 <copumpkin> Funktorsalat: well, the only thing I'm taking issue with is the fact that _x_
15:48:34 <copumpkin> it's saying for all objects X Y in the category, there exists a product X x Y
15:49:21 <copumpkin> unless I'm misunderstanding, this record might be called AllBinaryProducts or something?
15:49:56 <Cale> Whereas we normally make a definition like "(P, pi_k: P -> X_k) is a product of objects X_k if ..."
15:50:35 <copumpkin> yeah, so I'd parametrize the Product record by the objects it's a product of, and if you have all binary products, you'd have (X Y : Obj) -> Product X Y
15:50:38 <Cale> Which only defines when a particular object and bunch of projections is a product, rather than defining an operation as such.
15:50:41 <copumpkin> am I making any sense?
15:50:43 <Funktorsalat> (even as an operation, its properties depend on all objects)
15:51:03 <Cale> I suppose you could do that, yeah.
15:51:18 <Cale> It's a little bit rare to care about that in practice I think.
15:51:24 <copumpkin> probably :)
15:51:36 <copumpkin> just making sure I actually understand the material correctly though
15:51:46 <Cale> Well, okay, there are some preorder categories which are important and only have some but not all products.
15:52:11 <Funktorsalat> you might want a purely proofcontaining record that uses cale's definition
15:52:19 <Funktorsalat> and define the operation in terms of taht
15:52:20 <Funktorsalat> *that
15:52:49 <Funktorsalat> since even with the operation, you'll probably want to prove that A x B is isomorphic to any other product of A and B
15:52:49 <Cale> A product in a preorder (or poset) category is the same thing as a greatest lower bound for a set of values.
15:52:55 <copumpkin> yeah
15:53:13 <Cale> So, if you take the rationals under the standard ordering, there are some products, but not all :)
15:53:15 <copumpkin> Funktorsalat: oh, there's properties for that already, I just didn't include those
15:53:24 <copumpkin> well, I think stuff that approximates that anyway
15:53:26 <Cale> But all finite products!
15:54:38 <cobra> Can someone please take a look: http://hpaste.org/40285/strange_compiler_messages
15:54:40 <Funktorsalat> IIRC only posetal categories can have *all* products
15:54:42 <Cale> If you take the collection of subsets of a set having even cardinality under the subset ordering, then that'll have some finite products, but not all finite products.
15:55:03 <Funktorsalat> otherwise you'll get a cardinality error :)
15:55:29 <copumpkin> hm okay
15:55:35 <Cale> Funktorsalat: Set.
15:56:10 <Funktorsalat> Cale: you have to restrict to small sets to get an actual category
15:56:13 <Cale> Small + complete => preorder
15:56:20 <Cale> "small sets"?
15:56:25 <Funktorsalat> it won't have products over arbitrary families in the metatheory
15:56:31 <Cale> All sets are small :)
15:57:03 <Funktorsalat> one way is to use the set of all sets contained in a given grothendieck universe...
15:57:08 <Cale> The category Set isn't a small category
15:57:16 <Cale> It has all products
15:57:37 <Cale> and it's clearly not a preorder cateogyr
15:57:38 <Funktorsalat> indexed by sets
15:57:42 <Cale> category*
15:58:20 <Cale> They wouldn't be products if they weren't indexed by a set, would they?
15:58:35 <moosefish> So, I'd like to test a package against multiple versions of GHC (pretend I'm a maintainer). I tried compiling older versions of GHC, but (in my case) 6.12 won't compile 6.8 or 6.10. What's a sane approach?
15:58:39 <Funktorsalat> my point is you can't have products indexed by something as "large" (depending on your metatheory for the exact meaning) as the collection of objects
15:59:24 <Cale> moosefish: Download binaries of those GHCs, don't compile GHC yourself.
16:00:59 <Funktorsalat> so essentially I was just saying "small + complete => preorder" too, just with a slightly different idea of "small"
16:01:25 <Funktorsalat> (taking "small" as relative to some universe)
16:01:47 <Funktorsalat> (so you could ask about products indexed by something as large as that universe)
16:02:04 <moosefish> Cale: How far back can I go before old C libraries can become an issue?
16:04:45 <Cale> moosefish: I have no idea. I'm running 6.10.something in my Mac VM, and it's fine.
16:06:22 <Cale> moosefish: I probably wouldn't bother actually testing anything as far back as 6.8 myself. 6.10 is already pretty old.
16:08:39 <moosefish> Well, the first twist is that I need some dependencies (HTTP, network, binary); and with 7 around the corner breaking a few libs, I'm wondering how I'm gonna maintain different sets of installed cabal packages
16:09:41 <ddarius> copumpkin: What's the definition of Hom?
16:10:44 <copumpkin> ddarius: there's some indirection, but basically a category record has Obj : Set, and Hom : Obj -> Obj -> Set
16:11:33 <ddarius> copumpkin: How do you verify that the objects given to Hom are in the category that Hom is for or at least in the same category as each other (or rather one should be in the opposite category of the other)?
16:13:20 <ddarius> copumpkin: Also, to give a different answer to your earlier question.  You can talk about the the categorical product of just a pair of objects without saying anything about the existence of any other products in that category.
16:13:22 <adnap> Hey, does anybody mind taking a look at my xmonad.hs?  I've asked in #xmonad, but it's not as lively in there.  I'm having trouble getting fullscreen flash videos to work.
16:14:04 <copumpkin> you don't, as far as I can tell. You're specifying agda-level types that correspond to objects and morphisms of your category, but there's no guarantee that those agda-level types aren't also objects/morphisms of other categories (or the opposite of your category)
16:14:11 <copumpkin> ddarius: okay, makes sense
16:14:20 <copumpkin> I'll bring it up with the authors of the library and see what they say :)
16:16:24 <jmcarthur> adnap: if you solve that issue i'm also interested. i think it stopped working as soon as i set up the struts for my xmobar. this was a million years ago
16:16:49 <ddarius> copumpkin: Where is this library?
16:16:56 <adnap> Here's my xmonad.hs: http://hpaste.org/40286/xmonadhs?pid=40286&lang_40286=Haskell
16:17:42 <copumpkin> ddarius: colorized source for it is up here: http://web.student.chalmers.se/~stevan/ctfp/html/README.html
16:17:44 <adnap> I feel like this isn't right, 'cause I've got configs inside of configs and hooks inside of hooks.
16:17:46 <copumpkin> it's also on patch-tag
16:17:50 <jmcarthur> adnap: i get get flash to go full screen if i allow the window to float
16:17:56 <jmcarthur> *i can get
16:18:19 <adnap> jmcarthur: That's all I want.
16:18:50 <ddarius> That's a nice syntax highlighter.
16:19:27 <jmcarthur> adnap: i have a shortcut set up to make the next window i open float using XMonad.Hooks.FloatNext
16:19:41 <jmcarthur> adnap: so i can just hit that shortcut before making the flash video full screen
16:19:55 <jmcarthur> adnap: but it's still an extra step, so if you figure out a way to make it automatic that would be awesome
16:20:08 <copumpkin> ddarius: yeah, but it generates huge html with everything possible to hyperlink, hyperlinked 
16:20:21 <copumpkin> pretty nice compared to hscolour though
16:21:32 <jmcarthur> adnap: i suppose one of us could try to find some property of the flash window to make it autofloat, but i just haven't done it
16:21:40 <jmcarthur> my computer can't handle full screen flash anyway
16:21:58 <jmcarthur> intel graphics card
16:22:48 <adnap> jmcarthur: Ah, I just noticed that a bunch of people modified my paste.
16:24:03 <jmcarthur> well, i guess i can play it full screen now after all, awesome
16:24:25 <jmcarthur> i couldn't before. i guess something improved since i last tried
16:25:21 <ddarius> copumpkin: Everything being hyperlinked is what's nice about it.
16:26:05 <ddarius> jmcarthur: How old is your computer?
16:26:36 <copumpkin> I agree, but I'd still like the option to turn that off for other uses of syntax highlighting
16:26:52 <ddarius> copumpkin: Anyway, it seems that they are defining categories over the types of Agda.
16:27:25 <copumpkin> ddarius: how else could they do it?
16:28:21 <ddarius> copumpkin: They could use a more syntactic model, but this way makes sense for Agda.
16:28:49 <jmcarthur> ddarius: probably about two. it's really just the graphics card. either way, it works alright now
16:30:07 <ddarius> jmcarthur: Hmm, my four year old laptop never had problems with fullscreen flash.  It was the cheapest, new Dell laptop at the time and has an integrated graphics card, albeit an ATI one apparently.
16:32:40 <ddarius> copumpkin: At first I thought this was something you were writing.  Are there any uses of this thing?
16:33:38 <copumpkin> ddarius: I've contributed a couple of modules to it, but not sure there are any uses of it yet :) it started as a class project for some people taking a CT class, as far as I know, and now one of them is polishing it up and asking for code contributions from people willing to help
16:33:47 <adnap> jmcarthur: This works: 
16:33:52 <ddarius> "Conclusion: Category theory has very overloaded notation."
16:33:57 <copumpkin> lol
16:34:01 <adnap> jmcarthur: http://hpaste.org/40292/working?pid=40292&lang_40292=Haskell
16:37:37 <jmcarthur> adnap: huh, never saw isFullscreen before
16:37:42 <jmcarthur> adnap: thanks!
16:38:25 <copumpkin> ddarius: several aspects of agda make CT in it not entirely pleasant, but it's nice to be able to write down stuff and get it checked by the computer, if nothing else :P
16:39:11 <mgsloan> ell I'm gonna get a head start on ma homeworks
16:39:27 <mgsloan> hah embarrassing. wrong tab
16:39:28 <mgsloan> :D
16:50:48 <ddarius> kmc: Are you doing anything around lunch time on Sunday?
16:55:40 <kmc> ddarius, not sure.  a friend of mine might be in town then
16:56:12 <ddarius> kmc: I ask because my friend in Japan wants me to go to this some time: http://cambridgebrewing.com/menus/beer-runch/
16:59:30 <kmc> cool
17:06:40 <chessguy> howdy gang
17:07:55 <Saizan> hi
17:08:14 <dolio> Hey, it's cheeseguy.
17:10:11 <copumpkin> chessguy: wow, you've been gone for a while haven't you?
17:10:27 <chessguy> yeah
17:10:30 <copumpkin> (welcome back!)
17:10:33 <chessguy> i stop back in once in a blue moon
17:10:43 <chessguy> i'm mostly a ruby guy these days though...how's that for irony :)
17:10:56 <copumpkin> I did the opposite :)
17:11:31 <chessguy> at least for once i'm writing in the same language at home as i'm writing at work!
17:11:49 <megajosh2> Haskell made me stop bothering with Python for the most part
17:11:56 <megajosh2> Before that it was PHP (eewwww)
17:12:01 <chessguy> yikes
17:12:12 <chessguy> i would never take a job doing php
17:12:27 <megajosh2> It's so... inconsistent
17:12:34 <chessguy> and ugly
17:13:28 <megajosh2> They took a perl-ish language (minus only a tad of the ugly), hacked on object-oriented programming, and then LATER they decide "Hey, we need a library of classes for common data structures!"
17:13:55 <chessguy> data structures schmata structures
17:13:59 <ivanm> copumpkin: so, do you think mmorrow turned into a ruby guy as well? :p
17:14:22 <copumpkin> seems unlikely :)
17:14:38 <chessguy> not everyone is as evil as me
17:22:49 <narens> hello. Is there a way to print out values to the terminal (for debugging purposes) from a pure function? I am always having to make it IO for working through coding complex algorithms, but I really don't want to do that.
17:23:04 <copumpkin> Debug.Trace
17:23:15 <narens> danke
17:23:41 <copumpkin> keep in mind that you might not get something printed out at all using that "function"
17:23:46 <copumpkin> or it might print multiple times
17:23:51 <copumpkin> or might print in unexpected places
17:24:06 <narens> i see...
17:24:12 <copumpkin> the issue is that it lies about being pure
17:24:34 <copumpkin> and a compiler is free to rearrange things a lot for pure code
17:25:21 <copumpkin> and of course, there's no guarantee the expression your trace appears in even gets evaluated
17:25:35 <copumpkin> but, other than that it works fine :)
17:25:39 <narens> haha
17:26:07 <narens> Once I trace and fix the error, I'll remove it
17:26:18 <chrisdone> hai
17:27:29 <copumpkin> wow, textmate's haskell syntax highlighting really sucks
17:27:59 <Cale> Well, in practice, trace is a pretty good way to tell if things are being evaluated or not, and in what order, but yeah, it's not a reliable way to print non-debugging messages.
17:30:20 <chrisdone> @hoogle Text -> String
17:30:21 <lambdabot> Warning: Unknown type Text
17:30:21 <lambdabot> Network.BufferType buf_toStr :: BufferOp a -> a -> String

17:31:14 <copumpkin> unpack :: Text -> String
17:32:11 <megajosh2> Hey, what do you guys usually edit Haskell code with? I wanted to use haskellmode for vim but it's been acting a little odd
17:32:30 <megajosh2> Especially when I try to search for something on hoogle or in GHC docs
17:32:33 <EvanR> i use normal mode for vim
17:33:09 <Cale> Yeah, I use a basically plain vim with a few options set.
17:33:54 <Cale> http://hpaste.org/40299/my_vimrc
17:34:24 <chrisdone> I use emacs with haskell-mode and a few custom scripts
17:34:43 <Cale> There's some handy stuff there to make awkward whitespace visible. Tabs show up in bright red :)
17:34:54 <megajosh2> I was thinking about that, but didn't like the idea of learning an entirely new editor just to edit code in one language
17:35:08 <megajosh2> But then again, I might end up liking emacs better...
17:35:14 <megajosh2> I'd probably prefer the config
17:35:29 <djahandarie> I have trouble with vim in general
17:36:18 <chrisdone> emacs's strength lies in its mass of libraries and scriptability
17:36:18 <djahandarie> I just can't get the hang of needing to be in a specific 'mode' to actually type in the file and that mode has no precedence to any of the others
17:36:26 <chrisdone> the same goes for vim
17:36:44 <Cale> Really, anything which will convert tabs to spaces will work for me. Syntax colouring is also nice.
17:37:13 <megajosh2> Yeah, I use CSApprox to use colors made for gvim in the terminal
17:38:30 <Cale> I've used both emacs and vim, and I tend to use vim now for not really any particular reason.
17:38:36 <chrisdone> I quite like the idea of vim's modal editing
17:38:46 <chrisdone> yeah, I use emacs for the same reason really
17:38:59 <megajosh2> It was annoying when I first started using it, because I'd start typing and have no idea what was happening
17:39:09 <megajosh2> I just remember to hit "i" or "Insert" now :D
17:39:24 <megajosh2> Can't remember how long ago...
17:39:30 <gwern> I use emacs because it's not too terrible at any major things, very good at some things, and I can be using it 30 years from now
17:39:32 <chrisdone> when hitting Ctrl so much in emacs all day tires my pinkies I long for modal editing
17:39:44 <gwern> chrisdone: that's why god gave us capslock
17:40:03 * ddarius uses a console vim.
17:40:06 <chrisdone> gwern: that's not a real solution
17:40:33 <chrisdone> so you moved *one* of the control keys up by an inch, great job
17:40:41 * Cale remaps caps lock to compose.
17:41:00 <gwern> chrisdone: well, now your pinky is at rest on the capslock
17:41:03 <Saizan> the real solution are wires on the back of your neck, or butterflies
17:41:10 <gwern> at least when your hands are at rest on the home row
17:41:12 <chrisdone> gwern: which pinky?
17:41:16 <gwern> left
17:41:32 <Cale> I don't really understand why caps lock ever seemed like a reasonable idea to anyone.
17:41:36 <tommd> *grumble grumble* not enough maintainers *grumble grumble*
17:41:37 <chrisdone> so I can only use one pinky, that's bad
17:41:58 <gwern> Cale: I don't either. on the other hand, I have no idea how @ made it either
17:43:13 <tommd> Cale: Have you never seen diplomatic cables or military reports?  According to the movies those are always in caps.
17:43:13 <ddarius> Cale: I use capslock upon occasion.
17:44:02 <ddarius> gwern: My pinky rests on a when my hands are on home row.
17:44:24 <gwern> ddarius: clearly you are a mutant
17:44:41 * gwern puts 'take off and bomb ddarius from orbit' on the TODO
17:44:43 <copumpkin> really?
17:44:58 <copumpkin> should it not rest on the A?
17:45:30 <ddarius> Conveniently, a is a in both QWERTY and Dvorak.
17:45:31 <Draconx|Laptop> Cale, on a typewriter, there's significant resistance to holding down the shift key.  So a way to lock it seems entirely reasonable.
17:46:15 <benmachine> and m is m
17:46:25 <ddarius> benmachine: Yep.
17:46:36 <benmachine> I learnt all this a week or so ago
17:46:45 <benmachine> but then went, ok I need to actually type
17:46:58 <benmachine> so I deferred practicing for now
17:47:26 <adnap> I'm trying to import only specific things from a certain module, and I'm wondering how I import specific data constructors.  Currently, if I just import the type, it flips out when I reference one of the data constructors.
17:47:50 <megajosh2> Wouldn't you do it like `import Module (Datatype(SomeConstructor))' ?
17:48:11 <tommd> Most would, but not him.
17:48:15 <adnap> megajosh2: Yep!
17:48:28 <adnap> tommd: Hey!
17:48:32 <tommd> ;-)
17:48:44 <adnap> GOSH, I didn't know, OKAY??
17:49:02 <sipa1024> so now you do :)
17:50:06 <adnap> yerp
17:50:06 * chrisdone loops up the syntax for a loop in bash again
17:50:08 <benmachine> adnap: ...flips out?
17:50:10 <gwern> touchtyping is so useful
17:50:17 <adnap> hehe
17:50:21 <gwern> it's the closest thing to a BCI we'll have for decades
17:50:31 <Adamant> BCI?
17:50:35 <gwern> it's also useful outside of IRC too
17:50:36 <adnap> gwern: What is touch typing?
17:50:39 <gwern> Adamant: brain-computer interface
17:50:41 <Adamant> oh, brain-computer
17:50:42 <Adamant> yeah
17:50:50 <gwern> Adamant: the fancy name for being able to type while looking away from the keyboard
17:50:51 <benmachine> typing without looking at the keys, more or less?
17:51:06 * benmachine types with his eyes closed
17:51:06 <chrisdone> lol
17:51:10 <adnap> Oh, well I thought that was all part of knowing how to type.
17:51:11 <benmachine> not like, all the time, mind
17:51:12 <chrisdone> typing by the sense of touch
17:51:16 <chrisdone> duh
17:51:18 <Adamant> gwern: we already have those, you just have to think in Russian.
17:51:21 <benmachine> adnap: well yeah, most people do it
17:51:25 <Adamant> old Cold War tech.
17:51:27 <gwern> Adamant: nyety
17:51:35 <adnap> I don't like how I type--I'm slow.
17:51:43 <gwern> Adamant: no, quite a few people have to look or do it a letter at a time
17:51:52 <Adamant> I know
17:51:56 <gwern> I myself had to look at the keyboard and couldn't get past 50WPM
17:51:59 <benmachine> I can touch type dvorak but it's nowhere near a BCI because I do it at about one character/second
17:52:03 <adnap> I never learned home row.  I just know weird patterns.
17:52:08 * gwern then said fuck that shit and spent a week or two really learning how to type
17:52:11 <Adamant> I went to full touch typing from three-finger hybrid
17:52:12 <Adamant> yeah
17:52:19 <Adamant> I had to relearn it
17:52:26 <megajosh2> I just taught myself how to type by... trying to hit keys faster!
17:52:32 <gwern> IMO elementary school is too early to teach kids how to type
17:52:37 <adnap> I use all my fingers except the ones next to my pinkies.
17:52:40 <benmachine> I kind of have to touch type dvorak because looking at the keyboard doesn't help >_>
17:52:51 <benmachine> I used to look at the keyboard and stare at the t key and then press k
17:52:53 <chrisdone> megajosh2: the road to RSI is paved with good intentions and motivation
17:52:57 <adnap> My family and I went on vacation when the kids were learning to type.
17:53:39 <gwern> benmachine: droll
17:53:39 <benmachine> I have had about one lesson in typing ever
17:53:55 <benmachine> gwern: well, it's kind of interesting from a psychological perspective :P
17:54:11 <benmachine> that about touch typing as well, it's, like, muscle memory
17:54:17 <benmachine> I find it fascinating
17:54:18 <Adamant> I had lessons, but I ignored them a bit, so I had the three finger style
17:54:38 <benmachine> I was basically just taught "this is the home row put your fingers here" and then the rest I made up
17:54:44 <gwern> 'Windows dominates the installs, and is 50% of
17:54:44 <gwern> traffic to the HP site.
17:54:45 <adnap> I learned Dvorak a few months ago and could touch type, but I decided to quit before I got fast.  I think my reasoning had something to do with not wanting to always have to reconfigure keyboard shortcuts.
17:54:46 <chrisdone> gwern: well, it would at least improve the readability of youtube, even if the level of intelligence stays the same
17:54:51 <gwern> and yet, the windows users seem very silent
17:55:17 <gwern> “Why is haskell-platform 138MB? Does it include monad of the
17:55:17 <gwern> entire world?”
17:55:26 <gwern> hah. I think I'll @remember that one
17:55:32 * Saizan never learned to keep the fingers on the home row
17:55:45 <gwern> lambdabot: @remember anonymous Why is haskell-platform 138MB? Does it include monad of the entire world?
17:55:45 <lambdabot> Good to know.
17:55:49 <gwern> lambdabot: @flush
17:56:01 <chrisdone> I learned it after experiencing RSI
17:56:52 <chrisdone> I still get RSI but mostly because I spend all day typing and then all night typing without rest. I try to rest but projects won't code themselves :(
17:57:08 <Saizan> use less code.
17:57:23 <Cale> I type with my hands usually at a bit of a diagonal to the keyboard, so not straight across the home row. Seems like it would put less strain on my hands, but I don't have any measurements to prove that. :)
17:57:36 <benmachine> gwern: where'd that come from?
17:57:36 <chrisdone> Saizan: zen-like but ultimately not really practical
17:57:46 <gwern> benmachine: out of thin air
17:57:52 <Entroacceptor> chrisdone: do more planning
17:57:59 <gwern> it just appeared at my network interface, despite my laptop being plugged into nothing
17:58:01 <benmachine> chrisdone: code a code coder
17:58:08 <gwern> benmachine: my working assumption is deamonic possession
17:58:12 <Entroacceptor> you can do stuff without actually coding :)
17:58:17 <Saizan> yeah, write an AI first, then you're don
17:58:22 <Saizan> *done
17:58:36 <benmachine> gwern: I accept this without question.
17:58:39 <sipa1024> http://abstrusegoose.com/249
17:58:46 <chrisdone> Cale: technically that's not proper re health and safety, your arms are supposed to be straight from your body to the keyboard, and the hands hover above the keyboard and don't rest on a surface while typing. I don't know anyone who actually does this in reality apart from me
17:59:03 <Entroacceptor> I giueess it'd be quicker to rise a child to do that
17:59:05 <chrisdone> everyone likes to rest their arms on their arm chair so they type in a diagonal shape
17:59:31 <dancor> blah blah take it to #wereallgoingtodie
17:59:42 <gwern> dancor: holy shit, we *are*?
17:59:47 <gwern> WHY DOES NO ONE TELL ME THESE THINGS
17:59:56 <dancor> well, there are other channels to discuss that question
17:59:57 <sipa1024> actually, he just did
18:00:09 <chrisdone> gwern: uh, says here you're going to die. must've gotten lost in the mail. sorry, kid
18:00:11 <sipa1024> in a way
18:02:01 * dancor basks in the joyless silence
18:02:02 <chrisdone> heh, I just realised how friday it is in here
18:02:14 <chrisdone> 30 minutes have gone by without a discussion about category theory
18:02:34 <chrisdone> well, I think
18:02:50 <benmachine> how about them morphisms, huh
18:04:02 <sipa1024> the name is morpheus
18:04:09 <sipa1024> iso morpheus
18:04:15 <kmc> how 'bout them turing machines
18:04:20 <kmc> never know when they're going to stop
18:04:20 <chrisdone> The syntax for this loop is:
18:04:20 <chrisdone> for NAME [in LIST ]; do COMMANDS; done
18:04:21 <chrisdone> are you testing me, satan?
18:05:21 <ddarius> benmachine: You touch type currently, yes?
18:05:27 <chrisdone> is it possible that the more I learn about bash script the more I will like it?
18:05:33 <chrisdone> or will I always find it so repulsive?
18:05:59 <Cale> chrisdone: You can avoid semicolons in it if you indent it like you would Haskell.
18:06:07 <megajosh2> No it's definitely disgusting
18:06:13 <sipa1024> not sure... it has some pretty nasty non-pure side effects ;)
18:06:18 <gwern> chrisdone: no. the more you do it, the worse it gets
18:06:43 <gwern> my practice is that if it's simple and <10 lines, to write it in sh. else do it in haskell
18:06:46 <Draconx|Laptop> chrisdone, just wait till you learn its scoping rules!
18:06:50 <gwern> haskell really isn't too bad for scripting
18:06:57 <benmachine> ddarius: yes
18:07:20 <djahandarie> I do Haskell all day every day
18:07:37 <benmachine> djahandarie: does he appreciate your attention?
18:07:39 <dancor> djahandarie: what did you do with it today
18:07:59 <djahandarie> dancor, I used it to suffer while coding PHP at my day job
18:08:25 <gwern> despair! despair! this world of poseurs has driven me to despair!
18:08:30 * gwern pretends to hang self
18:09:52 <ddarius> benmachine: Okay, then the trick to learning Dvorak fast is to cheat.  Have a card or screen (or even keycaps) that shows you the layout.  Look at it while you type.  You should be able to get to 30WPM which is at least not painfully slow in a few days and not need the card anymore.  It should only take a couple of weeks (from starting) to get back to more or less the same speed as before.
18:10:53 <megajosh2> Hey, does anybody know how lambdabot uses plugins? Does it load code dynamically or are they compiled in?
18:10:56 <chrisdone> I got to about 40wpm in dvorak and gave up out of impatience
18:11:03 <benmachine> ddarius: having a card is faster than just knowing the layout?
18:11:20 <kmc> megajosh2, it was at one point based on http://hackage.haskell.org/package/plugins
18:11:24 <ddarius> benmachine: No, but you already have the layout memorized?
18:11:33 <gwern> megajosh2: what plugins? > is different from the rest
18:11:47 <ddarius> benmachine: The card is for learning.  You stop using the card once you no longer need it.
18:12:04 <djahandarie> It's neat that plugins got a new version
18:12:31 <benmachine> ddarius: well, I can type in dvorak using only my memory as reference, but sometimes it takes a second or more for me to remember where something is
18:12:31 <dancor> i use dvorak but i think i'd recommend colemak to new learners these days..
18:12:34 <megajosh2> gwern: I mean most of them
18:12:42 * benmachine googles colemak
18:12:56 <ddarius> benmachine: So you don't have memorized.  The card is definitely faster than that.  You are trying to develop muscle memory not brain memory.
18:12:59 <gwern> megajosh2: not sure. I think they're all compiled modules
18:13:14 <megajosh2> kmc: Did it just stop using dynamically loaded modules?
18:13:15 <benmachine> ddarius: I was hoping one would morph into the other :P
18:15:04 <ddarius> benmachine: That doesn't happen.
18:15:15 <gwern> @seen sm
18:15:16 <preflex>  sm was last seen on #darcs 2 hours, 35 minutes and 32 seconds ago, saying: yees... those env vars are set inside the commands, where the patch info is available, rather than in the hook-running code, which is outside the commands
18:15:16 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
18:16:01 <ddarius> benmachine: If I sit and memorize some sheet music, I won't be able to readily play it from memory.  If I learn to play a song, I won't be able to readily write out the sheet music from memory.
18:16:35 <benmachine> ddarius: hmm
18:17:07 <ddarius> I could not tell you what the Dvorak keyboard layout is from memory other than by manually imagining pressing each key (i.e. slowly.)
18:17:08 * benmachine is unconvinced by the literature for colemak
18:17:12 <chrisdone> this is why typing familiar words is n times faster than foreign words
18:18:22 <ddarius> benmachine: I agree.  If the main benefit (over Dvorak) is "easy to learn," it seems like it is optimizing the wrong problem.
18:18:51 <benmachine> yeah
18:22:15 <ddarius> Probably the best thing is to record every key you type for a few (representative) weeks and develop a keyboard layout optimized for what you actually type.  That Colemak makes Ctrl-Z/X/C/V easier is a detriment for me.  I don't type those.
18:23:06 <megajosh2> In a world... where everybody has a different keyboard layout...
18:23:20 <lispy> hey
18:23:42 <kmc> you can go to a lot of effort and develop your own layout
18:23:50 <kmc> or you can use Dvorak, which is almost as good and ships with every OS
18:24:13 <izukerman> newbie question: i'm using MemoTrie, and i'm looking to improve its performance.  it has an instance (MemoTrie Char); is there any way to redefine that instance?
18:24:35 <kmc> QWERTY sucks so let's used ADVANCED GENETIC ALGORITHMS to hyper-evolve a new OPTIMIZED LAYOUT using LASER MEASUREMENTS of my hands and nose
18:24:44 <ddarius> kmc: Damn straight.
18:25:14 <ddarius> You want to be able to type QWERTY but you don't want to do it for a long period of time.
18:25:51 <sipa1024> kmc: and the 5ns per keypress you'll gain by doing so will compensate the effort of doing this research + learning your own optimized layout after approximately 137 years of continuous typing?
18:26:05 <kmc> yeah
18:26:14 <kmc> but you'll get a lot of reddit upvotes
18:26:17 <sipa1024> worth a shot, i'd say
18:26:20 <kmc> and that's what really matters in life
18:26:25 <izukerman> anyone?  a way to override an instance defined in a library?
18:26:27 <ddarius> The not developing RSI will probably be more valuable.
18:26:28 <ivanm> kmc: that is of course soemthing to strive for
18:26:38 <kmc> izukerman, you can't
18:26:53 <kmc> you can make a wrapper type
18:26:57 <kmc> newtype MyChar = MyChar Char
18:27:01 <kmc> and write a new instance for MyChar
18:27:01 <arw> ddarius: not developing RSI is accomplished by a hand-support and less typing...
18:27:16 <arw> ddarius: or wrist-support
18:27:19 <ivanm> izukerman: instances are imported and exported implicitly
18:27:21 <benmachine> arw: then more typing is valuable
18:27:31 <ivanm> specifically designed so that you _can't_ have more than one instance at a time
18:27:35 <izukerman> and then newtype MyString = [MyChar]
18:27:44 <cobra> can threadDelay be used to sleep for hours, or even days?
18:27:47 <benmachine> *type
18:27:51 <izukerman> and then MyString everywhere?
18:27:57 <kmc> cobra, it can be used to sleep for (maxBound :: Int) microseconds
18:28:00 <kmc> or more, if you put it in a loop
18:28:10 <kmc> i think the "not developing RSI" goal is satisfied by Dvorak as well as any hyper customized layout
18:28:12 <ivanm> izukerman: you  might want to make MyString an instance of IsString then and use OverloadedStrings
18:28:15 <kmc> the reddit upvotes goal is not
18:28:18 <ddarius> kmc: Agreed.
18:28:19 <ivanm> izukerman: why do you want to do this?
18:28:34 <ivanm> kmc: what about something like coleman, which is a bit closer to qwerty?
18:28:34 <izukerman> like i said, MemoTrie seems slow; i'm trying to speed it up
18:28:38 <cobra> kmc: If I put it in a loop won't it potentially loose accuracy?
18:28:47 <kmc> cobra, there's no accuracy guarantee anyway
18:28:47 <benmachine> my main goal in using dvorak, coupled with xmonad: no bugger who has a sneaky look at my laptop will have any idea how to use it
18:28:52 <ivanm> izukerman: what are you using MemoTrie for?
18:28:54 <benmachine> <_<
18:28:58 <izukerman> specifically, i'm memoizing something String -> [String]
18:29:00 <kmc> when your thread becomes runnable there's no guarantee on how soon the OS or the Haskell RTS will actually run it
18:29:04 * ddarius doesn't think being "a bit closer to QWERTY" will actually make learning a keyboard layout any easier.
18:29:05 <ivanm> izukerman: have you actually profiled and found that the Char's are the problem?
18:29:17 <ivanm> ddarius: *shrug* some people do
18:29:23 <ivanm> but yeah, I'd think it'd make it _harder_
18:29:34 <cobra> kmc: yeah, so all of these small inaccuracies will build up to a big inaccuracy
18:29:36 <ddarius> The point for the optimized keyboard layout is that it is no harder to learn it than to learn Colemak or Dvorak.
18:29:46 <sipa1024> i know azerty and qwerty
18:29:49 <ddarius> The only awkward part is the few time costs of setting it up.
18:29:59 * hackagebot plot 0.1.1.2 - A plotting library, exportable as eps/pdf/svg/png or renderable with gtk  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-0.1.1.2 (VivianMcPhail)
18:29:59 <chrisdone> I don't get RSI if I take reasonable breaks and don't type loads at home after a day of work, but yeah I can't resist
18:30:18 <sipa1024> it's very hard to make your brain choose the right one automatically
18:30:21 <izukerman> i haven't pinpointed it to the char, no
18:30:26 <sipa1024> since they're very close to eachother
18:30:32 <ivanm> I don't get RSI because I tend to procrastinate too much...
18:30:37 * ddarius has never had wrist pains from typing and he doesn't use wrist support and doesn't take typing breaks, though he doesn't type all -that- much.
18:30:39 <ivanm> and making caps another control helped
18:30:50 <izukerman> but it seems to use fromEnum and then bit-twiddling
18:30:51 <chrisdone> I've never ever had wrist pain
18:31:02 <ddarius> s/wrist//
18:31:06 <ivanm> I _was_ getting wrist pains at one stage though, so i bought an MS natural keyboard and started using a tablet instead of a mouse
18:31:06 <kmc> cobra, it's not a matter of "inaccuracy".  you are misinterpreting the API if you think there's any guarantee other than a lower bound
18:31:07 <izukerman> an array lookup (i assume) would be much faster
18:31:13 <chrisdone> but finger pain, yes
18:31:24 <ddarius> chrisdone: What the heck?
18:31:27 <ivanm> izukerman: why do you need memoisation?
18:31:30 <kmc> if you call (threadDelay 1) the runtime system is allowed to take 5 minutes to get back to your thread
18:31:34 <izukerman> i'm lazy?
18:31:44 <ivanm> izukerman: so?
18:31:45 <ddarius> chrisdone: Do you hit the keys hard or something?
18:31:57 <chrisdone> no, I just type a lot
18:32:03 <izukerman> lookup = memo $ \prefix -> filter (isPrefixOf prefix) choices
18:32:09 <ddarius> chrisdone: I can't see how that would cause finger pain.
18:32:17 <benmachine> tendons on the back of my hands' where I get pain
18:32:27 <dobblego> I just had a wrist reconstruction
18:32:32 <ivanm> izukerman: do you have repeated applications that you actually need memoisation?
18:32:40 <ivanm> dobblego: along with numerous other parts of your body? :p
18:32:52 <dobblego> yes, 12 operations in the last 2 years
18:32:53 <ivanm> izukerman: have you profiled your code to see if memoisation is actually helpful/beneficial?
18:32:59 <dobblego> doctors are fucking idiots
18:33:08 <izukerman> 3649255 applications, 66405 evaluations of the underlying function
18:33:14 <Jafet> http://www.collectiondx.com/system/files/gits5.png
18:33:19 <chrisdone> ddarius: because I do it constantly all day. I tire them out and then keep going. it's stupid, I need to learn to stop
18:33:20 <izukerman> so, yes, it helps :)
18:33:22 <kmc> izukerman, did you look at data-memocombinators as an alternative to MemoTrie
18:33:24 <benmachine> dobblego: I suggest doing home surgery
18:33:27 <benmachine> with a kitchen knife
18:33:29 <kmc> should be easy to try both and profile
18:33:31 <dobblego> benmachine, I have
18:33:39 <benmachine> it tends to be equally effective.
18:33:41 <ddarius> chrisdone: What kind of pain is it and where is it more precisely?
18:33:48 <chrisdone> I get up at 8AM, and now it's 3AM and I'm still typing
18:34:09 <ivanm> chrisdone: heh
18:34:19 <ivanm> Jafet: I _love_ ghost in the shell
18:34:27 <chrisdone> ddarius: it's more of a dull ache, or a fire/burny feeling. only very rarely do I get a sharp pain which is a good indication that I need to turn the computer off, I don't ignore that pain
18:34:34 <dobblego> benmachine, I had a surgical emergency and doctors were too stupid to recognise it; I am senior first-aid qualified and own lots of medical equipment
18:35:00 * hackagebot plot-gtk 0.1.0.1 - GTK plots and interaction with GHCi  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-gtk-0.1.0.1 (VivianMcPhail)
18:35:13 <izukerman> hmm... it's not as pretty, but looks like it'll work for me
18:35:52 <ddarius> ivanm: My brain has a hard enough time with ten fingers.
18:35:58 <ivanm> heh, yeah
18:36:58 <izukerman> kmc: thanks!
18:38:39 * ddarius also thinks people fail to recognize just how amazing rampant literacy is.
18:39:01 * hackagebot hmatrix-gsl-stats 0.1.2.7 - GSL Statistics interface  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-gsl-stats-0.1.2.7 (VivianMcPhail)
18:39:23 <Jafet> I cut my thumbs off, now my brain types more efficiently. Not on phones, though
18:39:29 <ivanm> heh
18:39:38 <ivanm> and I bet it makes it harder to pick stuff up
18:39:41 <chrisdone> it's funny, I learned touch typing, changed layouts, changed keyboards, etc. only recently did I realise I can't sit typing flat out all day and not get fatigue. anyway I'm done doing what I wanted to do anyway, I'll leave these IRC logs importing. I intend on adding a search interface for hpaste for the last ten years of #haskell IRC. it's packaged with informal knowledge
18:40:11 <ivanm> chrisdone: are you going to resurrect hpastebot?
18:40:25 <chrisdone> ivanm: yep
18:40:29 <ivanm> \o/
18:40:59 <chrisdone> I'm considering having it detect if the nickname matches a nickname in the channel before announcing, this avoids spam
18:41:14 <chrisdone> but some people put nonsense nicknames because they're fools
18:41:14 <ivanm> and yes, the #haskell IRC logs are full of informal knowledge about climate change, worth of doctors, etc. ;-)
18:41:18 <ivanm> chrisdone: ooohhh...
18:41:25 <ivanm> how about actual hpaste spam?
18:41:42 <chrisdone> so far there's been none since I added a little spam trap
18:41:58 <ivanm> chrisdone: you need an FAQ with the answer to a query of "why isn't my paste being announced?" being a link to Mr T saying that fool qutoe :p
18:42:02 <ivanm> hpaste has a spam trap?
18:42:18 <chrisdone> ivanm: yeah. but you're not a spammer so you won't feel it :p
18:42:29 * pumpkin exploits
18:42:34 <ivanm> heh
18:42:37 <kmc> chrisdone, :D
18:42:43 <chrisdone> I was thinking I'll just add an RSS feed and then we can use feed2irc
18:42:44 <kmc> chrisdone, i was hoping someone would do that
18:42:44 <sipa1024> i read 'pumpkin explodes'
18:42:48 <kmc> and by someone i mean you specifically
18:43:07 <chrisdone> kmc: haha
18:43:16 <copumpkin> we were just talking about it yesterday :)
18:43:26 <copumpkin> gah
18:43:34 <ivanm> what, you exploding?
18:43:40 <copumpkin> if a huge enumeration type defines a custom Show instance that gives me no information
18:43:45 <copumpkin> is there an easy way to figure out which constructor I have?
18:43:57 <ivanm> probably not
18:44:00 <aavogt> pattern match
18:44:05 <ivanm> oh, wait, duh
18:44:06 <chrisdone> copumpkin: Data.Data can tell you that
18:44:08 <aavogt> copumpkin: derive Data?
18:44:10 <copumpkin> aavogt: yeah, I want to avoid doing a 200-element pattern match
18:44:15 <copumpkin> it's not easily under my control, the code
18:44:35 <ivanm> copumpkin: bah, script it!
18:44:49 <copumpkin> lol
18:44:54 <ivanm> use TH to write all your "isItFoo" functions!
18:45:07 <copumpkin>   show _ = "<TypeError>" -- TODO: more info?
18:45:13 <copumpkin> YES TODO DAMMIT
18:45:16 <chrisdone> hahaha
18:45:27 <benmachine> standalone-derive Data woo
18:45:43 <kmc> yup
18:45:48 <kmc> i would use Data.Data.Data.Data.Data
18:45:51 <benmachine> also does it derive enum, because that would help
18:45:57 <benmachine> yes that
18:46:11 <ivanm> kmc: seriously, does that exist?
18:46:13 <kmc> no
18:46:19 <kmc> Data.Data.Data is enough
18:46:23 <benmachine> upload it to hackage in a package called data-data
18:46:33 <ivanm> copumpkin: or, use TH to write a new Show instance which gets used for a newtype wrapper...
18:46:35 <benmachine> it can go in the Data category because really it's a bit sparse at the moment
18:46:41 <chrisdone> while we're on the subhject, I wonder if you guys have a solution for this little problem of constructor matching
18:46:49 <chrisdone> http://hpaste.org/40300/constructor_matching
18:47:36 <chrisdone> it would be cool to generalise patterns, i.e. foo (Nick n) t = (Just n,Just t,Nothing)
18:47:46 <chrisdone> where foo is 'whatever constructor'
18:47:54 <kmc> yeah, there are pattern calculi like that
18:47:55 <chrisdone> am I missing something here? it seems like this should be a lot easier
18:47:58 <kmc> Haskell doesn't have it though
18:48:04 <chrisdone> hmm
18:48:05 <kmc> chrisdone, maybe i should put it into my library :)
18:48:13 <benmachine> you could abuse generics >_>
18:48:13 <chrisdone> which library?
18:48:16 <aavogt> or-patterns
18:48:16 <kmc> anyway it sounds like something Data.Data could help with
18:48:24 <kmc> chrisdone, you're using clogparse right?
18:48:24 <benmachine> that is to say, you could use generics
18:48:27 <chrisdone> yeah, that's what reminded me of it
18:48:28 <chrisdone> kmc: mhm
18:48:35 <kmc> i'm wondering if this should be in that lib
18:48:41 <kmc> it's a little odd though
18:48:56 <chrisdone> yeah. Event -> Maybe Nick, Event -> Maybe Text, etc
18:49:09 <kmc> i like Event -> Maybe Nick anyway
18:49:15 <kmc> because most events pertain to one nick
18:49:18 <chrisdone> or if it provided fields, that would be easier
18:49:23 <kmc> yeah
18:49:29 <chrisdone> then I could match the ones without nicks, and for the rest use the accessor
18:49:34 <kmc> i don't like record fields on types with more than one constructor
18:49:44 <chrisdone> yeah, it can be a recipe for problems
18:50:03 <copumpkin> aha!
18:50:04 <kmc> anyway i've got to go now, bug me about this later and i can probably add some useful stuff
18:50:04 <aavogt> http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3919
18:50:07 <copumpkin> *Main Data.Either> toConstr $ clValue $ snd q
18:50:08 <copumpkin> ModuleDefinedInOtherFile
18:50:12 <copumpkin> yay standalone deriving
18:50:13 <copumpkin> thanks guys
18:50:28 <chrisdone> kmc: ah, I didn't realise you were the author 
18:50:34 <chrisdone> copumpkin: awesome!
18:50:49 <chrisdone> aavogt: hmmm! interesting
18:51:08 <aavogt> it's done in other languages
18:52:16 <dancor> can you catch fail?
18:52:26 <ivanm> IOException or something IIRC
18:52:32 <chrisdone> dancor: I think it depends on the monad
18:52:42 <chrisdone> fail in Error is throwError, right?
18:53:01 <benmachine> the default for fail is error which can only be caught in IO
18:53:09 <chrisdone> whereas fail in Maybe is probably just const Nothing
18:53:16 <benmachine> yeah
18:53:17 <chrisdone> > fail "boo" :: Maybe ()
18:53:18 <lambdabot>   Nothing
18:53:23 <benmachine> and in lists it's empty list
18:53:28 <benmachine> > fail "" :: Either String Int
18:53:29 <lambdabot>   Left ""
18:53:32 <ddarius> Hmm.  There's a _|_ milestone...
18:53:40 <copumpkin> yeah, not sure why
18:54:10 <benmachine> less information than any other milestone?
18:54:11 <ivanm> ddarius: I believe _|_ is short for "we really need to get this done, but have nfi when we'll do it"
18:54:32 <benmachine> I thought it was just "no particular deadline"
18:54:39 <benmachine> a sort of bluesky marker
18:57:50 <ivanm> roconnor: I tend to lean towards your thinking wrt HP
18:59:15 <benmachine> chrisdone: btw, listify (\(Nick _) -> True) will find the Nicks in a structure, I think
18:59:30 <chrisdone> :t listify
18:59:31 <lambdabot> forall r a. (Data a, Typeable r) => (r -> Bool) -> a -> [r]
18:59:36 * benmachine searches the docs for something more appropriate
19:00:00 <om-foxy> I have a package installed in the global package database, but when I try to load a file that imports one of the package's modules, ghci says it can't find it.  (The only difference I can see it that the package now depends on base >= 4 not >= 3).
19:00:58 <benmachine> hmm
19:01:08 <chrisdone> benmachine: hmm that could be nice
19:01:28 <ddarius> benmachine: A normal gmapQ with special cases for constructors with multiple nick fields should be appropriate.
19:01:32 <benmachine> everything (++) (mkQ [] (\(Nick n) -> [n]))
19:01:46 <benmachine> ddarius: yeah, I was just wondering if there wasn't something direct
19:03:47 * ddarius should make an (toyish) implementation of Jay's pattern calculus.
19:04:40 <chrisdone> @hoogle listify
19:04:41 <lambdabot> Data.Generics.Schemes listify :: Typeable r => (r -> Bool) -> GenericQ [r]
19:05:51 <roconnor> ivanm: I think there are several of us
19:06:01 <chrisdone>  No instances for (Data.Data.Data Event, Data.Typeable.Typeable Nick)
19:06:08 <chrisdone> oh well :p I'll get kmc to add this
19:06:12 <ivanm> roconnor: it might have been better if they started from scratching rather than just renaming extralibs
19:06:24 <ivanm> but yeah, it gets us mtl, etc.
19:06:27 <chrisdone> benmachine: was gonna do: nickAndText a = (listToMaybe $ map (\(Nick n) -> n) $ listify (\(Nick _) -> True) a, .., ..)
19:06:46 <ddarius> chrisdone: Or you can see the conversation we had with copumpkin just a few minutes ago.
19:07:13 <ivanm> roconnor: that was also one of the biggest problems people had when I said tomberek and I wanted to re-write FGL: "OMG, it's, like, in the platform, so you can't, like, change it!!!" [note: not an actual quote :p]
19:07:21 <chrisdone> ddarius: orphan instances? in MY code?
19:07:30 <roconnor> ivanm: what is the FGL?
19:07:36 <ddarius> chrisdone: Are you writing an application or a library?
19:07:40 <benmachine> ivanm: in fairness they fixed one of the annoyances with mtl recently
19:07:51 <benmachine> (the mysterious "they")
19:07:56 <ivanm> roconnor: Functional Graph Library; tomberek and I have taken it over from Martin Erwig
19:07:57 <roconnor> benmachine: the cabal
19:07:59 <ddarius> mtl was changed?
19:07:59 <ivanm> benmachine: heh
19:08:06 <ivanm> roconnor: there is no Haskell Cabal!
19:08:12 <roconnor> ivanm: neat
19:08:12 <ivanm> ddarius: some Either instances were moved to base IIRC
19:08:24 <dancor> catching binary error is hard because you have to do your (catch) around the entire area that the lazy evaluation could finally occur, and you have to catch ErrorCall which is pretty general.
19:08:33 <ddarius> ivanm: Ah, yes.
19:08:36 <benmachine> ddarius: latest version on hackage was uploaded on 4th of september
19:08:46 <roconnor> as an aside.  darcs is way better than svn
19:08:47 <roconnor> that is all
19:08:50 <chrisdone> ddarius: an application. but I've done it now anyway. hence, I'll get kmc to add the instances for the next time I use his library
19:08:59 <benmachine> ivanm: well, yes, but also the instance in mtl for current base versions was changed to match it
19:09:02 <ivanm> roconnor: I think that's been proven many times ;-)
19:09:15 <chrisdone> just a quick throw away script to import the irc logs into postgresql
19:09:18 <ivanm> benmachine: right, it's a bit hard to move them if you dont' remove them from mtl ;-)
19:09:27 <ivanm> chrisdone: and get some sleep? :p
19:09:28 <copumpkin> agda's API isn't very friendly
19:09:29 <ddarius> chrisdone: For applications such instances aren't too bad.
19:09:30 <copumpkin> :(
19:09:33 <chrisdone> ivanm: :p
19:09:46 <ddarius> copumpkin: Agda's API for what?  Or the Agda API like the GHC API?
19:09:58 <copumpkin> Agda is a library, actually
19:10:02 <copumpkin> they have a small executable wrapper
19:10:05 <dancor> should i switch from git+github to darcs+patch-tag
19:10:06 <ddarius> copumpkin: Yes I knew.
19:10:24 <copumpkin> oh, then I just mean the API to ask it to typecheck a module
19:11:18 <gwern> dancor: if you have to ask, obviously there are no compelling advantages
19:11:24 <chrisdone> this is partly why my hands are aching today http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/?title=Special:Recentchanges&limit=100
19:11:41 <dancor> idle thoughts
19:11:47 <copumpkin> chrisdone: spamm0r!
19:11:54 <chrisdone> <___ <
19:12:01 * copumpkin reverts it all
19:12:05 <chrisdone> hahaha
19:12:10 <chrisdone> no /o/
19:12:31 <gwern> chrisdone: you know I see each edit like 3 times in the rss feed
19:12:35 <ivanm> preflex: seen feuerbach
19:12:35 <preflex>  feuerbach was last seen on #haskell 2 days, 5 hours, 25 minutes and 24 seconds ago, saying: ddarius: could you please explain why not?
19:13:01 <chrisdone> gwern: gwuafahaha
19:13:01 <copumpkin> ddarius explained why not, and feuerbach never returned :(
19:13:55 <ivanm> copumpkin: heh
19:13:59 * gwern suffers sadness as chrisdone cruelly mocks my misery
19:14:23 <ivanm> there's apparently going to be a hackathon in kiev in a week or so... don't recall seeing any -cafe messages about that one!
19:14:38 <chrisdone> cheeky!
19:15:05 <chrisdone> they ... kiev told you about that one!
19:17:01 <adnap> Do you think it's bad to use mod' in general if your doing graphics stuff?  It seems like you will accumulate rounding errors.
19:17:11 <adnap> *you're
19:18:02 <ivanm> chrisdone: huh?
19:18:19 <chrisdone> ivanm: bad pun :(
19:18:21 <ivanm> adnap: how does mod lead to rounding errors?
19:18:25 <ivanm> chrisdone: oh, right
19:18:35 <chrisdone> ivanm: are you near kiev?
19:18:40 <ivanm> no
19:18:41 <adnap> ivanm: The floating point version
19:18:47 <chrisdone> ._.
19:18:57 <ivanm> I've been there though
19:19:10 <ivanm> and would consider going again, but it's a bit late notice now :p

19:20:30 <Lemmih> adnap: How is mod' defined?
19:20:38 <adnap> Lemmih: I'm not sure.
19:20:43 <ivanm> @src mod'
19:20:44 <copumpkin> EvanR: sure
19:20:44 <lambdabot> Source not found. Your mind just hasn't been the same since the electro-shock, has it?
19:20:44 <EvanR> i think usually the guides ignore the fairly common cause where a value of type IO a does no IO at all
19:20:45 <benmachine> EvanR: I'd've thought "arbitrary" includes "none"
19:20:48 <ivanm> chrisdone: yup
19:20:57 <copumpkin> EvanR: I think the point is that you no longer have any guarantees

19:21:55 <dancor> should the hackage 'binary-strict' package be removed or noted as being replaced by the cereal packgae these days?
19:22:35 <ivanm> dancor: well, binary itself is going to replace cereal when kolmodin finishes it apparently... ;-)
19:22:57 <dancor> how long has that been planned
19:23:08 <dancor> and when is it expected to occur
19:23:45 <dancor> i need to feed all this into my algorithm of balancing disinformation and lost utility
19:25:39 <EvanR> it seems fairly simple to have an exception handler catch every error and print a message
19:25:45 <EvanR> but how about a 'backtrace' ?
19:27:12 <aavogt> http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/stack-trace/DebugTraces.pdf coming to a ghc near you EvanR?
19:28:27 <Jafet> I expect there'll be a surcharge
19:29:42 <EvanR> next challenge

19:32:00 * chrisdone go bed
19:34:04 <coolness> u
19:34:05 <coolness> sup
19:34:25 * Jafet gives EvanR a mouse
19:34:50 <EvanR> what kind of solution is that
19:35:01 <EvanR> this is functional programming, we do things the hard way ;)
19:35:11 <aavogt> use screen?
19:35:37 <EvanR> screen would help?
19:36:04 <Jafet> Dump from screen and use awk -- the hard way!
19:36:38 <EvanR> could be pretty cool when finally binded to a three finger combo ;)
19:36:58 <Jafet> I thought they called that emacs.
19:37:12 <dancor> you can copy and paste a list with screen, maybe you want to see "yank rectangular blocks" in man screen
19:37:22 <EvanR> ok
19:38:01 <dancor> i'm not saying it's a joy to use screen's copy buffer.  but faster than rewriting in haskell with yi-sub-editing intergration
19:40:52 <dancor> EvanR: also see "to the screen-exchange file".  i think you could then have a command pull a url from there and tell browser to go there
19:41:36 <coolness> hey if i install a windows version of haskell on my pc and than make a program and i tkae my program on another pc which doesnt have haskel will it work like wat is the dependancies?
19:42:03 <gwern> coolness: it depends
19:42:10 <gwern> (obviously)
19:42:35 <coolness> like how do i have to submit my exe with some dlls from haskel?
19:43:03 <dancor> EvanR: or it might be a faster or more pleasing to have a command parse urls from screen or xterm history and allow you to select from those..
19:43:43 <augur> hey peeps
19:43:45 <dancor> i guess that's already been said(/sed)
19:43:55 <aavogt> coolness: you can put some dlls in the same dir as the exe
19:44:12 * dancor awkward
19:44:20 <aavogt> that has worked for haskell exes using gtk2hs for me
19:44:32 <EvanR> yes sounds groovy
19:53:09 <coolness> there aint many source code examples for haskel on the net 
19:53:24 <copumpkin> that's a bold statement
19:53:31 <coolness> looks like a minority use haskel
19:54:04 <copumpkin> that's not a bold statement
19:54:05 <coolness> do u know source code locks? for haskel exe
19:54:11 <copumpkin> ?

20:22:07 <adnap> I'm having a problem getting this to work: move :: Vec3 Float -> Vec3 Float -> Float -> Vec3 Float
20:22:10 <adnap> move position direction t = position + t * direction
20:22:28 <adnap> ghci seems to think I want the Float version of (*).

20:27:23 <lambdabot> forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
20:28:13 <adnap> Oh, wait.  I see what's happening.
20:28:59 <adnap> It was working before in ghci because when you do 3 * (0:.1:.0:.()), 3 becomes (3:.3:.3:.()).
20:29:13 <ddarius> realToFrac t ?
20:29:35 <adnap> I was under the illusion that there was a (*) :: a -> Vec3 a -> Vec3 a
20:29:48 * ddarius blechs at treating a torsor like a group.
20:30:40 <djahandarie> A torsor? What is a torsor here?

20:34:24 <Jonno_FTW> hmmm
20:40:22 <ddarius> class Group g => GSet t g | t -> g where act :: g -> t -> t; class GSet t g => Torsor t g where (./) :: t -> t -> g; -- forall t1 t2. act (t1 ./ t2) t1 = t2
20:46:45 <copumpkin> data Info = Nope
20:46:50 <copumpkin> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/Agda/2.2.8/doc/html/Agda-Syntax-Info.html
20:48:10 <ManateeLazyCat> copumpkin: What's Agda?
20:48:18 <copumpkin> a cool programming language
20:48:26 <ManateeLazyCat> copumpkin: Example?
20:48:31 <copumpkin> hm
20:48:38 <ManateeLazyCat> copumpkin: How about vs Haskell?
20:48:59 <ManateeLazyCat> copumpkin: I found many people talk about Agda... 
20:49:11 <copumpkin> it has dependent types
20:50:46 <copumpkin> so the typical example is
20:50:54 <copumpkin> a type of vectors of a specific length
20:51:09 <copumpkin> Vec 5 Bool
20:51:22 <copumpkin> or in agda, it'd usually be Vec Bool 5
20:51:45 <copumpkin> it's the type of boolean "lists" of length 5
20:52:17 <copumpkin> but that's just scratching the surface of what you can do
20:52:24 <copumpkin> as you can do something similar to that in haskell
20:52:45 <djahandarie> You can? I thought you can only do SafeList kinda with GADTS?
20:53:01 <copumpkin> just use type-level peanos
20:53:23 <djahandarie> How would you do the (plus m n) restriction on the result of vappend for example?
20:53:30 <copumpkin> with a type family
20:54:05 <copumpkin> or a fundep MPTC if you swing that way
20:55:19 <dmwit> Whoa, that's some Baader-Meinhof. I just learned about torsors a few days ago.
20:55:58 <dmwit> We need a better example of when to use dependent types.
20:57:45 <dmwit> You can write the type of well-formed XML, for example, and have a function which is statically known to only emit (or only have to operate on) well-formed XML.
20:58:35 <dmwit> (...and you can replace "well-formed XML" with any computable predicate you like.)
21:00:18 <Jafet> I thought you could do that in haskell
21:01:02 <dmwit> You can have a type which is a representation of XML. But you can't have a type that is String, restricted only to XML strings.
21:02:21 <Jafet> Well, in agda you can also express the concept of valid XML. I wouldn't imagine doing that in haskell statically
21:02:31 <dmwit> Yes, exactly.
21:12:48 <ddarius> Jafet: You couldn't prove that statically, but you could enforce that modulo a "trusted kernel".
21:13:32 <om-foxy> http://hpaste.org/40301/could_not_find_module <- why is the module not being recognised?
21:13:46 <ddarius> So dmwit, do you know the name of the generalization of torsors to rings?
21:16:05 <dmwit> nope
21:16:43 <dmwit> om-foxy: odd
21:17:09 <dmwit> om-foxy: What's "ghc-pkg list hmatrix" look like?
21:18:33 <dmwit> ddarius: I learned about it from http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html, which mentions that there *is* a generalization to rings, but doesn't name it.
21:19:53 <om-foxy> dmwit:
21:19:54 <om-foxy> $ ghc-pkg list hmatrix
21:19:55 <om-foxy> /var/lib/ghc-6.12.1/package.conf.d
21:19:57 <om-foxy>    hmatrix-0.10.0.0
21:20:39 <dmwit> You're not starting ghci with any crazy option like --use-only-local-packages-to-confuse-you or anything like that, right?
21:20:58 <om-foxy> no: $ ghci Main.hs
21:22:11 <lispy> om-foxy: ghci --version
21:22:30 <om-foxy> I have another module that imports Numeric.LinearAlgebra and it works
21:22:32 <om-foxy> $ ghci --version
21:22:33 <om-foxy> The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.12.1
21:23:16 <dmwit> You definitely spelled Numeric.LinearAlgebra correctly, right?
21:23:44 <dmwit> Also, that file should probably be named Main.lhs, not Main.hs.
21:24:02 <dmwit> (Though it would give a different error if that were the problem, so that probably won't help.)
21:24:52 <dmwit> Basically I have no idea what's wrong.
21:24:54 <om-foxy> hm: it was spelled correctly, but I retyped it just the same and now it works.  Could that be some emacs/unicode thing?
21:25:07 <lispy> oh
21:25:20 <lispy> om-foxy: yeah, N
21:25:29 <lispy> om-foxy: I think the first character is not a normal N
21:25:40 <om-foxy> arg
21:25:46 <om-foxy> thanks for your help

21:31:31 <kmc> chrisdone, around?
21:33:23 <copumpkin> I doubt it, he's in italy
21:33:26 <copumpkin> and isn't like me
21:35:01 <kmc> aww
21:35:20 <kmc> i was gonna add features to clogparse for him
21:35:24 <ddarius> dmwit: One notion of semiring would fit, but not the more popular one.  Rng would also be a generalization but not one general enough to encompass Baez's example.
21:35:33 <lispy> copumpkin: you're in Italy?
21:35:38 <kmc> ManateeLazyCat, www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf
21:35:46 <copumpkin> lispy: yep
21:35:52 <lispy> copumpkin: I had an idea you might find interesting
21:36:04 <Jonno_FTW> @tell siracusa no I didn't fix the misssing header file problem, I think it was caused by problems with the header file itself after using -v3, not that the installer could not find the file
21:36:05 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
21:36:18 <lispy> copumpkin: Do you recall Tom Hawkin's recent -cafe post about a Haskell based DSL for real-time embedded programming?
21:36:29 <copumpkin> lispy: I think so
21:36:38 <lispy> copumpkin: Well, actually he wanted to use haskell and modify the backend of a compiler
21:36:44 <copumpkin> oh yeah
21:37:25 <ddarius> kmc: Did you see his request for Data instances?
21:37:28 <lispy> copumpkin: I was thinking...Wouldn't a 'mini-agda' actually do even better?  You could guarantee termination for example.  And all the extra info you'd have should be useful somehow to the codegen
21:37:44 <kmc> ddarius, no, that would make sense though
21:37:50 <lispy> copumpkin: I think you'd still need streams, so some codata for good measure would be nice too
21:38:02 <copumpkin> lispy: it would! I've wanted to make some "domain-specific" agda-derivatives, but it's relatively unexplored
21:38:36 <ddarius> [22:05] <chrisdone>  No instances for (Data.Data.Data Event, Data.Typeable.Typeable Nick)
21:38:36 <ddarius> [22:05] <chrisdone> oh well :p I'll get kmc to add this
21:39:22 <lispy> copumpkin: I wish I had infinite free-time.  I'd totally make a dependently typed language for hard real-time embedded systems :)
21:39:31 <copumpkin> lispy: me too! :P
21:39:40 <copumpkin> but then again, I probably have more free time than you do
21:40:01 <lispy> Provably real-time might be a stretch for the state of the art in theorem provers though :(
21:40:19 <dmwit> Infinite free time is overrated. I would settle for guaranteed food and Internet.
21:40:24 <ddarius> lispy: See temporal logics.
21:40:38 <ddarius> dmwit: What about water and shelter?
21:40:46 <dmwit> optional
21:40:53 <Jafet> Be a desert lizard
21:41:06 <dmwit> no shelter => drink the rain
21:41:09 <Jafet> ...who uses the internet
21:41:41 <newsham> hmm, I defined "instance Applicative STM" in my module because I want to use <$> and <*>.  it works, but ghc complains of "orphan instance".  what gives?
21:41:59 <ddarius> > 50 * 600
21:42:00 <lambdabot>   30000
21:42:49 <dmwit> newsham: Does your module define either the Applicative class or the STM type? If not, it's an orphan instance.
21:42:51 <kmc> newsham, http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#orphan-modules
21:43:08 <dmwit> It's not too dangerous. The usual workaround if you don't like the warning is to newtype-wrap STM.
21:43:26 <newsham> uhh.. newtype wrap stm just because they didnt give me an applicative instance?
21:43:36 <newsham> sounds somewhat retarded, no?
21:43:55 <dmwit> Yes indeed.
21:44:49 <dmwit> Bonus points if it annoys you enough to patch the STM library.
21:45:33 <ddarius> newsham: If you are writing an application or any other code that doesn't need to be imported by others, then it's not a big deal.  If you are writing a library then you definitely don't want to make instances for classes and types you don't control.
21:45:41 <newsham> i always felt the ability to define instances for types outside of the module that the type was written in is a strength
21:46:22 <newsham> now dmwit tells me i shoudl submit patches for every instance i want every library's data type to be 
21:46:28 <ddarius> newsham: It is, for classes you control or types you control or when you don't care about playing nice with others.
21:46:38 <newsham> dd: got it.
21:47:21 <ddarius> If you make an Applicative instance and I make an Applicative instances then our two packages can never be used in the same program ever.
21:48:15 <dmwit> So, GHC lets you do what you want to do, but warns you that there are drawbacks... and this is a bad thing?
21:48:18 <newsham> sounds like a deficiency
21:48:55 <pumpkin> yeah, it'd be nice if there were a good way to talk about and hide instances
21:48:56 <dancor> the good old Global Instances Lock
21:49:01 <pumpkin> lol
21:49:42 <ddarius> newsham: It's a deficiency in Haskell itself albeit it is not clear how to fix it appropriately.
21:50:55 <Gracenotes> well /r/haskell is unexpectedly busy
21:51:57 <Gracenotes> in posting if not commenting :)
21:56:03 <dancor> spj reveals that next up for ghc is comic sans
21:56:34 <djahandarie> Haha
21:56:53 <dancor> programming just got a lot more fun
21:57:04 <Gracenotes> come on, comic sans is the official haskell font
22:02:35 <djahandarie> "Glorious new back end" haha
22:02:55 <copumpkin> it's all pretty glorious
22:03:00 <copumpkin> I'm excited for what's coming
22:04:49 <Gracenotes> simon marlow's talk was also very fun and informative. no video though? (yet..)
22:05:46 <Gracenotes> man I need to go to conferences more often
22:08:33 <copumpkin> what did he talk about?
22:10:33 <Gracenotes> copumpkin: fixing a serious performance bug in parallel thunk evaluation
22:10:50 <pumpkin> aha
22:10:59 <Gracenotes> an easy-to-grok glimpse into the RTS
22:20:57 <pumpkin> man, eu-prleu-peupeu or whatever his name was hasn't come and trolled in ages
22:21:21 <pumpkin> preflex: seen eu-prleu-peupeu
22:21:21 <preflex>  eu-prleu-peupeu was last seen on #haskell 254 days, 4 hours, 38 minutes and 56 seconds ago, saying: oh ok
22:22:24 <dons> Gracenotes: did you enjoy it today? found it useful?
22:23:43 <Gracenotes> I'm very glad I came. I have a queue of papers to read now, too....
22:24:30 <dons>  and thankfully almost everything this week is online.
22:24:44 <dons> icfp, haskell workshop, hiw.
22:24:50 <Gracenotes> I watched the HIW videos from last year, it seemed a little better organized this year
22:25:03 <Gracenotes> but I wasn't there
22:25:34 <dons> last yeah was very grassroots.
22:25:40 <Gracenotes> well audience participation++
22:26:07 <ddarius> Lolliproc sounds like it might be the paper I wanted to write.
22:27:56 <Gracenotes> I guess ACM Digital Library will fill up with symposium talks eventually
22:28:08 <Gracenotes> or if not, at least ICFP ones..
22:28:39 * Cale just spent the last 2 hours or so cleaning his keyboard with rubbing alcohol. Still not perfect (the space under the keys is hard to clean perfectly), but all the keys are pretty clean now.
22:28:48 <pumpkin>  2 hours!
22:28:51 <pumpkin> that's pretty hardcore
22:29:23 <ddarius> pumpkin: When you consider the opportunity cost... it was probably more in Cale's interest to simply buy a new keyboard...
22:29:29 <Cale> Probably
22:30:23 <Cale> But then I would have missed out on the exercise in patience. ;)
22:30:52 <EvanR> i take all the keys off
22:31:07 <Cale> I did too :)
22:31:22 <Cale> I took them all off, and cleaned each surface of each key.
22:31:26 <EvanR> but on laptops it seems thats sometimes irreversible
22:32:58 * ulfdoz puts them into the dishwasher.
22:33:13 <ulfdoz> That is, the keys and other plastic parts, not the notebook.
22:33:27 <pumpkin> I can't remove the keys from my laptops
22:33:29 <pumpkin> :(
22:34:32 <ddarius> pumpkin: Yeah, that's my problem.  I think they might come off some way but it isn't obvious how until after you've broken at least one off.  You also can't apply the solution I suggested for Cale.
22:34:50 <ddarius> Though I am considering buying a new, cheap laptop.
22:36:07 <ulfdoz> If you can remove the whole keyboad, it could be enough. Usually they aren't that sensitive about getting wet.
22:39:20 <augur> Cale!
22:39:22 <augur> pumpkin!
22:39:24 <augur> ddarius!
22:44:20 <lpsmith> So I have a good start on a blog post about enumerating the pythagorean triples,  but I'm having a difficult time deciding how to present the material.
22:45:37 <lpsmith> It feels like a pretty simple post for me,  which makes the presentation a bit more difficult.
22:46:18 <lpsmith> Out of curiousity,  does anybody here know much about enumerating the pythagorean triples?  There is a reasonable body of literature,  but I haven't really looked at it.
22:47:05 <winxordie> pythagorean triples are weird little things
22:47:58 <Cale> lpsmith: I know a nice algorithm for enumerating the primitive ones based on an algorithm for enumerating the rationals.
22:48:02 <winxordie> last time I checked, one could generate any pythagorean triple from 3 "starter" equations and 3 iterative algorithms
22:48:15 <winxordie> *any primitive pythagorean triple
22:48:20 <Gracenotes> my favorite triple is (3, 7, sqrt(10))
22:48:21 * hackagebot plot 0.1.1.3 - A plotting library, exportable as eps/pdf/svg/png or renderable with gtk  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-0.1.1.3 (VivianMcPhail)
22:48:35 <winxordie> Cale: I'd be interested in said algorithm. Please do tell.
22:49:01 <Gracenotes> of course when you restrict yourselves to integers, it gets.. boring. not the most exciting corner of number theory.
22:50:49 <Cale> @let posRationals = 1 : (posRationals >>= \x -> [1+x, 1/(1+x)])
22:50:52 <lambdabot>  Defined.
22:51:21 <Cale> @let pyth r = (x,y,z) where m = numerator r; n = denominator r; [x,y,z] = sort [2*m*n, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2]
22:51:23 <lambdabot>  Defined.
22:51:35 <Cale> > map (pyth . (+1)) posRationals
22:51:37 <lambdabot>   [(3,4,5),(6,8,10),(5,12,13),(8,15,17),(7,24,25),(20,21,29),(16,30,34),(10,2...
22:51:40 <winxordie> There we are: generating all the primitive triples from (3,4,5) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Parent.2Fchild_relationships
22:52:24 <lpsmith> http://hpaste.org/40302/enumerating_pythagorean_triple
22:52:45 <Cale> My program is shorter ;)
22:52:47 <lpsmith> That's mine,  it produces only the pythagorean triples (c,a,b) in lexiographic order
22:52:56 <winxordie> quite beautiful.
22:53:04 <lpsmith> only the primitive pythagorean triples, that is
22:53:06 <Cale> I suppose mine doesn't do the lexicographic order bit
22:53:39 <Cale> > posRationals :: [Rational]
22:53:41 <lambdabot>   [1 % 1,2 % 1,1 % 2,3 % 1,1 % 3,3 % 2,2 % 3,4 % 1,1 % 4,4 % 3,3 % 4,5 % 2,2 ...
22:54:00 <Cale> > posRationals
22:54:02 <lambdabot>   [1.0,2.0,0.5,3.0,0.3333333333333333,1.5,0.6666666666666666,4.0,0.25,1.33333...
22:54:30 <lpsmith> hmm,  what's the name of that?  I use the Calkin-Wilf tree to enumerate my rationals.
22:54:40 <lpsmith> Is there a name?
22:57:41 <Gracenotes> there's a functional pearl about this
22:57:50 <Gracenotes> but a bit more sophisticated
22:58:07 <lpsmith> Enumerating the Rationals?  Aye,  I like that one a lot
22:58:50 <lpsmith> Enumerating the Rationals examines the Calkin-Wilf tree in some depth.
23:02:15 <lpsmith> winxordie, do you know if the linear transformations produce each triple once,  or does it produce some triples more than once?
23:10:42 <lpsmith> Well, in any case, thanks Cale and winxordie for the ideas to think about :)
23:10:54 <winxordie> lpsmith: I don't know. I think it does produce each one once, but I can't read the original paper. (It's in Swedish)
23:11:14 <lpsmith> heh, yeah I can't read swedish either
23:12:17 <Zao> One of those deranged Chalmers lads?
23:12:21 * winxordie needs to learn Swedish to read Swedish math papers and sing DotA
23:12:39 * Zao sitter här i venten... *shudder*
23:12:53 <Zao> What paper, by the way?
23:13:22 <winxordie> Zao:this one -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#CITEREFBerggren1934
23:13:43 <lpsmith> heh
23:14:31 <Zao> Heh, 1934. That'll be fun, even for a native speaker.
23:14:54 <winxordie> wikipedia paper linkage is my compromise for a pre-arxiv past.
23:15:11 <winxordie> Zao: You think the language changed that much in ~75 years?
23:15:38 <winxordie> er, 65.
23:15:54 <winxordie> no, 75. darn. I can count!
23:17:10 <Zao> The large reform in the early 1900s should have stabilized, but I'd expect that lots of old verb forms will still be in use.
23:18:57 <lpsmith> Heh,  maybe because the US is so much larger than Sweden,  but the concept of language reform is entertaining to me.
23:19:11 <lpsmith> The US can't even adopt Metric.
23:20:18 <winxordie> As an American, the notion of standardized language seems foreign to me. :P
23:20:31 <lpsmith> lol
23:20:32 <Zao> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svenska_Akademiens_Ordbok <- patience is a virtue.
23:20:46 <Zao> They've been working on the dictionary linearly since 1898 :D
23:21:57 <winxordie> Good lord! Let it never be said that people could not wait a century to finish a literary work.
23:28:30 <Jafet> Well, there's not much else to do up there
23:28:56 <tensorpudding> It's a dictionary.
23:29:06 <tensorpudding> I can't really say a dictionary is literature.
23:29:55 <lpsmith> Is "A Million Random Digits" literature?
23:29:55 <tensorpudding> Also how do they deal the numerous words added and removed since they started?
23:29:58 <earthy> if it's anything of the type of the 'woordenboek der nederlandse taal', then yes, it is literature. ;)
23:29:59 <winxordie> I'd call the OED literature.
23:30:10 <Jafet> The one by Bierce might be.
23:30:41 <Zao> tensorpudding: It's inclusive of all words since 15xx, with the translation of the bible and all.
23:30:41 <tensorpudding> It depends on the definition.
23:30:58 <Zao> tensorpudding: I expect they will make another pass when they're done :D
23:31:19 <Zao> It's much like making a dd clone of a running system partition :)
23:31:21 <earthy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woordenboek_der_Nederlandsche_Taal
23:31:48 <tensorpudding> Most people mean fiction when they say literature.
23:32:23 <tensorpudding> Though it could be taken to be the body of all published work, which would include dictionaries.
23:32:32 <lpsmith> tensorpudding, I see where you are coming from,  but I'd say fiction is a bit too narrow a scope for "literature"
23:33:15 <winxordie> To quote the OED, definition #2: Literature - "Literary work or production; the activity or profession of a man of letters; the realm of letters."
23:33:41 <lpsmith> A Million Random Digits (was) a rather important piece of the technical literature.
23:33:52 <winxordie> The OED says that the OED is literature.
23:33:59 <lpsmith> Historical works can have high literary value
23:34:10 <tensorpudding> That definition wouldn't include the OED.
23:35:05 <tensorpudding> Unless you define what "literary" means.
23:35:06 <winxordie> well, maybe not until we get to the definition of literary - "Pertaining to books and written compositions; also, in a narrower sense, pertaining to, or having the characteristics of that kind of written composition which has value on account of its qualities of form"
23:35:09 <winxordie> lol
23:35:45 <tensorpudding> Okay, so that would mean that all writing in book form would be literature.
23:36:02 <winxordie> Well, I think it's the narrower sense part we're debating
23:36:12 <tensorpudding> Its wording seems subjective to me.
23:36:29 <winxordie> speaking of which, I've just discovered that #literature exists on freenode.
23:38:11 <tensorpudding> Soft sciences on Freenode are not usually highly topical
23:38:28 <tensorpudding> the channels thereof, I mean
23:39:23 <tensorpudding> Maybe it's full of topic trolls that try to say "dictionaries aren't literature, go to #dictionaries"
23:39:53 <winxordie> I'd hope the situation would be otherwise. Bookchan has a thorough following.
23:40:24 <tensorpudding> Bookchan?
23:41:11 <Cale> "#dictionaries is about the open source word list project, go to ##dictionaries instead" ;)
23:41:54 <tensorpudding> ah, the unofficial dictionaries help channel
23:44:17 <Jafet> Are there any programs that are considered literature?
23:44:27 <mornfall> Jafet: TeX
23:45:07 <Jafet> Oh dear, a Pascal program
23:45:33 <tensorpudding> WEB is literate, but might not be literature.
23:46:15 <winxordie> I look forward to the first edition of Writing Haskell Literature in Literate Haskell - written of course in Literate Haskell.
23:46:33 <Jafet> It would be nice, if programs could be written whose literary value didn't depend on <natural language blah>.
23:46:40 <ddarius> Are FreeNode channels "help" channels?
23:47:08 <mornfall> Help, I am trapped in a Freenode channel!
23:54:28 <augur> infuriating fact: the large hadron collider cost about 8 billions dollars to build.
23:54:42 <augur> maybe 10 billion
23:55:51 <augur> the total cost of the iraq war so far is about 70 large hadron colliders
23:56:32 <augur> the same about of money was given to large corporations during the first round of bailouts
23:56:42 <winxordie> TARP expires tomorrow.
23:56:52 <augur> an amount that has subsequently skyrocketed to 14 trillion (1400 LHCs)
23:57:13 <augur> can you IMAGINE what kind of scientific progress we'd make if we spend like that on science of all sorts?
23:57:32 <Jafet> Clearly Currency cannot be a well-behaved instance of Num
23:57:56 <augur> the annual budget for the whole of the NSF per year is only 7 billion
23:58:03 <augur> we spend that in a few weeks in iraq
23:58:31 <winxordie> I'd argue expectation value wise, we can never spend enough on the NSF
23:58:55 <augur> yes well, we have EM maximization algorithms for that tho ;D
23:59:06 <augur> .. EM maximization, thats a bit redundant
23:59:21 <augur> this is what happens when you type an acronym and decide itd be better to spell it all out, but only go half way
23:59:24 <Entroacceptor> augur: than you for making the bad start of a weekend even worse 
23:59:31 <augur> Entroacceptor: i try
