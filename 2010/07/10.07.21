00:05:06 <handonson> what would be the best thing to do if I have a ByteString "Some words.\r\n" and I want to strip those newline characters at the end and get a new ByteString
00:06:29 <fffej> I'm having some trouble with {#sizeof my_type#} with c2hs - it's moaning that it can't find "my_type", yet the line before has successfully done {#pointer *my_type as MyTypePtr -> MyType}.  Am I missing something obvious?
00:06:59 <Zao> {#sizeof MyType#} ?
00:07:10 <napping> the line before doesn't actually need to have my_type
00:07:12 <dobblego> where is the Monad instance for ErrorT defined?
00:07:37 <napping> it can just generate code that mentions it, without having found and parsed the definition
00:07:45 <fffej> zao: if I change it to MyType then it says that doesn't exist in the header.  
00:08:15 <fffej> zao: my_type = C type, MyType = my mapping of C type to Haskell 
00:08:44 <fffej> napping: but if I change my_type in the {#pointer#} declaration to badger_monkey_banana then it complains it can't find it so that suggests it is parsing it correctly
00:09:16 <tolkad> Does haskell have a better language design than C++?
00:10:28 <tolkad> I just think that if haskell had the C++ templating system it would be much better
00:10:33 <arcatan> @faq Does haskell have a better language design than C++?
00:10:33 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
00:10:37 <j4cbo> ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
00:11:59 <napping> Type classes cover most of the sane uses and many of the insane uses of C++ templates
00:13:38 <tolkad> I also think that std::string is better than haskell's string type in some ways
00:13:53 <j4cbo> tolkad: care to elaborate?
00:13:58 <j4cbo> or are you just trolling?
00:14:00 <napping> That's for sure.
00:14:03 <napping> [Char]]
00:14:44 <j4cbo> having String be defined as [Char] is, in some ways, a bit dumb
00:14:49 <j4cbo> it's also convenient
00:15:00 <napping> 4 64-bit words per character
00:15:13 <napping> I dare say that will do for "some ways"
00:15:30 <Veinor> yeah, haskell is not exactly the most memory-efficient
00:15:40 <napping> ByteString is much better for most purposes
00:16:01 <napping> handonson: how about length and take?
00:16:08 <tolkad> Yeah, C can efficiently combine, append to, and produce dynamic strings in a much cleaner way
00:16:15 <tolkad> C++
00:16:16 <tolkad> I mean
00:16:44 <napping> You need to use a proper library in Haskell
00:17:33 <tolkad> also, C++ has nicer error messages and better type safety
00:17:38 <handonson> napping: great! thanks.
00:18:11 <napping> handonson: it's O(1) and shares the string data, so it should be pretty efficient
00:18:17 <c_wraith> man.  some older versions of gcc had hilarious error handling.  One missing semicolon lead to 150 compile errors in one case. :)
00:19:01 <handonson> napping: exactly. i was thinking of reversing and unconsing it, but hesitated because it will be O(n). thank you for your suggestion.
00:19:01 <j4cbo> s/some older versions of //, and s/had/has/
00:19:56 <tolkad> yeah, haskell should take a look at how C++ does template error messages
00:20:03 <napping> handonson: I think that ends up being exactly equivalent
00:20:15 <napping> handonson: if you are lucky
00:21:28 <ddarius> For a strict ByteString length, take, drop are all practically free.
00:21:58 <napping> handonson: nope, I don't see any rules for fusing reverse . reverse after all
00:22:07 <napping> so the way with take is much better
00:22:21 <napping> that is, will alwyas be much faster
00:22:54 <handonson> then i should use something like take (length (x-2)) x
00:23:14 <napping> properly parenthesized, but yes
00:23:49 <tolkad> C++ also makes it incredibly hard to write bad code, in haskell it's really easy to misuse language features in end up with unmaintainable code
00:23:58 <napping> ??
00:24:00 <opqdonut> ??
00:24:21 <opqdonut> of course, c++ makes it incredibly hard to write any code
00:24:33 <opqdonut> but I'd say writing bad code is as easy as writing good code
00:24:37 <ddarius> fffej: To just make a pointer to a type you don't need the definition.  To calculate the size, you do.
00:25:14 <napping> Ah, that would do it
00:25:30 <napping> be sure you can see a definition for the pointer, not just a declaration
00:25:33 <tolkad> opqdonut: well in haskell you could make all your functions return IO (whatever they would normally return)
00:25:38 <napping> are you sure the C code can use it as a struct?
00:28:24 <Gracenotes> hrm.. is there a nice way to get a reverse-order list from a Set in one pass?
00:28:34 <dolio> In C++, all your functions automatically return IO whatever automatically, whether you want them to or not.
00:28:57 <Gracenotes> I don't see any such thing :(
00:29:07 <opqdonut> Gracenotes: possibly by using Traversable or some such
00:29:34 <tolkad> http://lwn.net/Articles/249460/
00:29:38 <ddarius> Gracenotes: You could make a newtype that reverses the ordering and store those and then you'll get them in reverse order assuming they come out in ascending order.
00:29:38 <Gracenotes> oh hm. though probably not a very lazy list
00:30:10 <Gracenotes> sounds painful
00:30:27 <Gracenotes> though due to the total lack of reverse-friendly functions, might be the only option. such a left bias, I say
00:31:01 <dolio> Weird that there's a toAscList and not a toDescList.
00:31:10 <dolio> Considering that the former is probably the same as toList.
00:31:44 <wli> Quick newtype/etc. that reverses comparison
00:32:30 <RayNbow> :t GHC.Ext.Down
00:32:31 <lambdabot> Couldn't find qualified module.
00:32:33 <Gracenotes> since I want to query it lazily from both ends anyway, I'd rather not use a frankenewtype
00:32:55 <RayNbow> :t GHC.Exts.Down
00:32:56 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> GHC.Exts.Down a
00:33:32 <RayNbow> :t GHC.Exts.sortWith
00:33:33 <lambdabot> forall a b. (Ord b) => (a -> b) -> [a] -> [a]
00:35:28 <ddarius> dolio: toAscList was probably provided more so that people won't rely on that property from toList
00:37:46 * hackagebot graph-rewriting-ski 0.5.2 - Two implementations of the SKI combinators as interactive graph rewrite systems  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/graph-rewriting-ski-0.5.2 (JanRochel)
00:47:31 <dolio> ddarius: I bet they do anyway. :)
00:50:49 <Cale> Gracenotes: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/containers-0.3.0.0/Data-Set.html#v%3AdeleteFindMax
00:51:09 <Cale> Er, actually maxView
00:51:45 <luite> that will trigger a lot of rebalances though
00:51:50 <Gracenotes> yep. though it still doesn't get me top k elements in O(k) time.
00:51:56 <Cale> unfoldr maxView (fromList [1,2,3])
00:52:36 <Gracenotes> (with some log factor that I'm not sure about)
00:52:56 <Cale> Well, it's O(k log n)
00:53:08 <Cale> To use maxView over and over
00:53:33 <Cale> But luite is right about rebalancing. It would be nice to have some numeric splitting functions for that.
00:53:50 <Gracenotes> oh yeah. I think Map has those.
00:54:29 <Gracenotes> er still I don't know what k is. let me see if there's a way I can cheat through having to do this
00:55:12 <Cale> Gracenotes: k is the number of elements of the resulting list that you look at
00:55:34 <Cale> :t unfoldr (Data.Set.maxView)
00:55:35 <lambdabot> forall a. S.Set a -> [a]
00:55:54 <Cale> Each maxView is O(log n) where n is the size of the set
00:55:58 <c_wraith> Cale: I think the point was that k is an unknown in the application
00:55:59 <Gracenotes> yeah, that's how I used it, but I mean that it might be 1 or n depending on certain conditions about the data I find
00:56:11 <Gracenotes> ambiguous phrasing
00:56:14 <Cale> That's fine. Laziness.
00:56:18 <Gracenotes> (or anywhere inbetween)
00:56:27 <Cale> The list result that you get is lazy
00:56:41 <Cale> Use as many elements as you need, and you'll pay log n for each one.
00:57:08 <Cale> (actually log(n-k) for the kth one)
00:58:06 <Gracenotes> I have this compulsion to work out the exact sum. but it's O after all
00:59:46 <Gracenotes> so the algorithm involves a list of elements [], and a Set of elements which is a subset of the list. I need to pick an element from this Set, the highest one possible that satisfies certain properties.
01:00:05 <tolkad> Hello John.
01:00:09 <tolkad> Yes, I know your name
01:00:17 <Gracenotes> D:
01:00:40 <tolkad> you too, James
01:00:43 <tolkad> and Stephen
01:00:49 <Gracenotes> though the properties might possibly depend on the set difference of the list and the set.
01:01:03 <Gracenotes> I need to see...
01:01:32 <Gracenotes> at present maybe the best approach is to do reverse . toList
01:02:18 <Cale> Gracenotes: anyway, unfoldr maxView is pretty close to asymptotically optimal for what you want
01:02:25 <Cale> Gracenotes: You don't need to do that
01:02:32 <Cale> Well, hmm
01:02:42 <Cale> reverse will screw up your laziness
01:02:49 <Cale> But it costs O(n)
01:03:02 <Cale> and toList somehow magically is O(n)
01:03:06 <ManateeLazyCat> I got a strange behaviour, i use hGetContents get string from "output handle" of runInteractiveProcess. I can use putStrLn print output string, but i can pass "output string" as argument to gtk2hs code.
01:03:13 <ManateeLazyCat> Any trick?
01:03:22 <Gracenotes> because stack-navigating has no cost :)
01:03:25 <Cale> So reverse . toList is O(n), but you'll pay essentially all of that before you get your first element
01:03:43 <chrisdone> morning
01:03:48 <Cale> Whereas with unfoldr minView, you get your first element in O(log n) time
01:03:53 <Cale> er maxView, sorry
01:03:55 <chrisdone> is it naughty to define fmap f ir = pure f <*> ir?
01:04:19 <chrisdone> i feel like i should be able to do it the other way round
01:04:35 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: I don't understand your problem
01:04:36 <Gracenotes> applicative requires functor no
01:04:48 <dolio> chrisdone: It's fine.
01:04:49 <ManateeLazyCat> Like above code, i can use putStrLn print output string of hGetContents, but i can't output string no work for gtkh2s code, how strange?
01:04:54 <Gracenotes> ooh. hm, naughty.
01:05:04 * ManateeLazyCat pasted "hGetContents strange" at http://paste2.org/get/922201
01:05:06 <Cale> chrisdone: Use liftA instead
01:05:10 <Gracenotes> Cale: I'll have to examine the problem a bit more closely to see what shortcuts I can take...
01:05:11 <Cale> chrisdone: fmap = liftA
01:05:16 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: http://paste2.org/get/922201
01:05:39 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: I use putStrLn test output string looks works.
01:05:59 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: But when i use "textViewSetText textView str", can't work....
01:05:59 <ksf> can someone give me one or two examples where I'd want to weight my automata (that doesn't involve natural language processing)?
01:06:23 <chrisdone> Cale: oh, I forgot about that
01:06:30 <Gracenotes> what kind of automata
01:06:50 <ksf> finite or transducers, I don't care.
01:06:57 <ksf> weighting them, in general.
01:07:19 <ksf> (I'm not interested in anything that can't be determised and minimised)
01:07:21 <chrisdone> Cale: that's funny, that it can use the liftA definition despite Applicative being a subclass of Functor. 
01:07:26 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: It's terminal emulator for bash, but looks output string from hGetContents got strange behaviour.
01:08:08 <Cale> chrisdone: The subclass constraint just means there has to be an instance. It places no restrictions on how you write that instance. They could even be mutually recursive if it helped :)
01:08:27 <ksf> (actually, not all weightened transducers are determisable. dunno about vanilla weighted ones)
01:08:32 <chrisdone> Cale: I like that
01:08:34 <Gracenotes> weights as costs which are added? dunno maybe google scholar knows :|
01:08:41 <ksf> heh.
01:09:06 <ksf> google scholar and the internets in general talk a lot about weighted transducers, but virtually not at all about unweighted ones.
01:09:07 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Example, i input "ls" for input handle, i can use putStrLn print result with "ls" command, but looks can't work with gtk2hs function.
01:09:19 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: weird
01:09:32 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Very weird.
01:09:59 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: If it can print by putStrLn, it can works for any function need "String" argument.
01:10:22 <ksf> ...the only reason I can imagine right now why I would add weights is to identify hot paths, but that's an operational thing orthogonal to any other algorithm.
01:12:01 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: You can use "ghc --make Main.hs -threaded" compile it, can you reproduce my problem? Or just me has this problem?
01:13:01 <Peaker> tolkad was one funny troll
01:14:11 <chrisdone> okay, I posted tryhaskell to /r/programming. it now includes an optional chat interface to #haskell. I'll be around here all day to pull the plug, if there are any problems. expect some newbies joining from 'webchat/1234/ip.123.456.789.123' asking basic questions
01:14:42 <ksf> THE ETERNAL JULY HAS BEGUN!!!!1
01:14:56 <silver> wait what
01:15:18 <silver> 10 days left in ETERNAL JULY
01:15:18 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: I'll give it a shot. Not sure if I have gtk2hs on this machine. I'm running 6.10.4 here (because I need ghc iphone, and it hasn't been updated)
01:15:25 <Peaker> I've bridged #haskell to 4Chan's LOL forum, I hope you guys don't mind
01:15:33 <ksf> silver, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September
01:15:42 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: I think gtk2hs should works on ghc-6.10.4
01:15:47 <Cale> oh, good, I do have it
01:15:49 <chrisdone> Peaker: hehe. we'll see, I'm hopeful of positive curiousity
01:15:53 <plediii> ksf: why would you make it july?
01:16:00 <ksf> because it's july.
01:16:03 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Develop iphone haskell program?  
01:16:09 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: Yep
01:16:14 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: A game :)
01:16:28 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: For Ryan5000 ?
01:16:32 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: yeah
01:16:35 <silver> and what about android, can I have haskell on android?
01:16:41 <Cale> silver: sool
01:16:43 <Cale> soon*
01:16:44 <shachaf> Apple banned that, didn't it?
01:16:46 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Any screenshot? 
01:16:50 <Cale> silver: We're working on it.
01:16:57 * ManateeLazyCat I'm used to be a game developer... :)
01:17:39 <Peaker> shachaf, then they unbanned some of what they banned
01:17:49 <Peaker> shachaf, though not sure if the later unban includes Haskell or not
01:18:08 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Infact, my code is so simple that don't need install gtk2hs, i just wonder why that logic can't work?
01:19:42 <quicksilver> zygoloid: neat.
01:20:36 <quicksilver> shachaf: every application on the app store violates one or more of apple's bans
01:20:41 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Most strange is, like this "forkIO $ do putStrLn "hello"; hGetContents outHandle >>= putStrLn", you can print reslu by putStrLn, but 'putStrLn "hello"' even don't execute. How strangle....
01:20:52 <quicksilver> shachaf: this suits them quite well, because it means they can easily produce a justification for removing any piece of software.
01:21:02 <quicksilver> shachaf: those are the rules of the game, for those who wish to play :)
01:22:02 <ManateeLazyCat> Have any trick about hGetContents i need care?
01:22:13 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: There is one thing
01:22:14 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: unsafeInterleaveIO
01:22:29 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Can you reproduce it?
01:22:40 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: You must never close a handle on which you've used hGetContents
01:22:41 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: What's it?
01:23:03 <chrisdone> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.1/src/GHC-IO-Handle-Text.html#hGetContents
01:23:05 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: It's supposed to close itself, when you're done with the string
01:23:24 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: The textViewSetText doesn't work for me
01:23:32 <DarkUnicorn> hm, would it be possible to define a type "TwitterMessage" which is a string with at most 140 characters? so that it gives an type error when i try to append something to the string without respecting the length?
01:23:39 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: But I don't know if that's just Gtk2Hs or what. I see the string in the terminal.
01:24:01 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Yes, putStrLn can print, and textViewSetText should work.
01:24:03 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: it's possible but ugly
01:24:37 <Cale> textViewSetText textView "hello"  doesn't even work
01:25:18 <DarkUnicorn> chrisdone: why is it ugly?
01:25:44 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: If you put textViewSetText textView "hello" at top-level, it should work, strange is, once you wrap it in forkIO ... it looks can't execute.
01:25:46 <silver> Cale, ohh cool, is there any place where I can check status of this or browse current  problems to try to help to make Haskell into the Android?
01:25:56 <quicksilver> Cale, ManateeLazyCat : you can't make gtk2hs calls from any thread other than the main thread.
01:26:12 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: postGUIAsync
01:26:24 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/haskelldb/0.12/doc/html/Database-HaskellDB-BoundedList.html#t%3AN0
01:26:29 <quicksilver> yes, the postGUIAsync version should work
01:26:30 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: Oh right, of course.
01:26:38 <quicksilver> but not until gtk gets its next idle event
01:26:49 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Strange is not that, strange is any code in forkIO can't execute except "hGetContents out >>= putStrLn"
01:26:50 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: gtk sucks at threads
01:26:57 <jbapple> I just used -Odph and my program got VERY slow
01:27:01 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: I have did it,
01:27:09 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Add "-threaded" can work.
01:27:09 <jbapple> I got the idea from here: http://donsbot.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/migrating-from-uvector-to-vector/
01:27:19 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: it's essentially simple type arithmetic
01:27:26 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: You just need uncomment "postGUIAsync $ textViewSetText textView str" then add "-threaded" flags.
01:27:34 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Then you can use forkIO in gtk2hs code.
01:27:39 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: still fails for me
01:27:46 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: But I'm using an old gtk2hs
01:27:47 <dolio> jbapple: Compared to the same code without -Odph?
01:27:57 <jbapple> dolio: yup,
01:28:06 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: see how it works?
01:28:12 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: I just use textView, so i think all version should work.
01:28:14 <jbapple> dolio: 0.54 seconds -> 3.58 seconds
01:28:15 <keido> huh this is interesting
01:28:25 <dolio> Is it short enough to show?
01:28:30 <jbapple> uh, not really
01:28:41 <dolio> Hmm...
01:28:45 <luite> chrisdone: wow must have been a lot of work to type al those instances :)
01:28:52 <chrisdone> Nn is defined as being less than N(n+1) and greater than N(n-1) using type-classes. the instances tell you whether a string is less than or equal to 140 characters
01:29:08 <jbapple> dolio: It's a new hashtable. It's not THAT long, and I can put it in the source repo pretty quickly
01:29:28 * ManateeLazyCat pasted "putStrLn "hello" even can't work." at http://paste2.org/get/922223
01:29:35 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Like above code, I add "putStrLn "hello" before "str <- hGetContents out", but why "putStrLn "hello"" can't work?
01:29:38 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: Are you trying to say that postGUIAsync works with a fixed string like "hello", but does not work if you use the output of hGetContents?
01:29:52 <quicksilver> or does it not work even with a fixed string?
01:30:03 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: uh, it should work
01:30:06 <dolio> jbapple: Are there any polymorphic partially applied functions that should be inlined and specialized?
01:30:16 <jbapple> dolio: But if -Odph is allowed to make things much slower if they don't use any parallelism, then it's not a bug yet
01:30:34 <jbapple> dolio: I dunno
01:30:40 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I have test, fixed string like "postGUIAsync $ textViewSetText textView "hello"" can't work,
01:30:50 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: oh
01:30:55 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: so it's nothing to do with hGetContents?
01:30:58 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: And not just gtk2hs, any code except "hGetContents out  >>= putStrLn" can't work.
01:31:03 <quicksilver> it's just postGUIASync not working?
01:31:11 <dolio> Well, I don't think it should cause a big slowdown like that. But it does change the way some optimizations work, I think.
01:31:20 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: any code except "hGetContents out >>= putStrLn" can't work.
01:31:47 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: It's very weird.
01:31:52 <quicksilver> because calling hGetContents on bash is probably never going to work.
01:32:01 <quicksilver> it will block if bash stops outputting
01:32:04 <jbapple> dolio: well, I made a note. I'll get to a reproducible test case some time
01:32:06 <dolio> -Odph is supposed to be mostly like -O2 with some bigger limits on certain optimizations.
01:32:12 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I have use getProcessExitCode test bash process, it's still running.
01:32:17 <quicksilver> which bash does often because it's an interactive program
01:32:17 <jbapple> It might just be the primmonad bug
01:32:29 <dolio> If you're using primmonad, then possibly.
01:32:30 <quicksilver> you cannot sensibly use hGetContents on an interactive process.
01:32:49 <quicksilver> hGetContents should not be used on an underlying filehandle which might block, unless you don't mind that blocking whichever thread happens to be accessing the string
01:33:02 <quicksilver> if that thread is your GUI thread then your whole GTK interface will block.
01:33:17 <quicksilver> are you following ManateeLazyCat ? (do you agree, Cale? )
01:33:42 <quicksilver> jbapple: My vague memory is that -Odph is pretty unreliable in all released versions of GHC, but has worked well in some unreleased HEAD versions. I could be wrong.
01:33:44 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: But why "hGetContents out >>= putStrLn" can work in forkIO ? Can you explain that?
01:33:58 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: I just did explain it, I think.
01:34:09 <Cale> quicksilver: I'd agree with that. Here it seems to be disastrous.
01:34:11 <jbapple> quicksilver: well, in that case I just won't use it. Thanks for the tip
01:34:18 <quicksilver> the danger point is if you access the string from the GUI thread
01:34:30 <quicksilver> hGetContents out >>= putStrLn is not accessing it in the GUI thread.
01:34:41 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: simplified version: Never, ever use hGetContents.
01:34:47 <quicksilver> Not ever. Under any circumstances.
01:34:56 <Cale> textViewSetText strictly evaluates the entire string, causing the program to block
01:34:56 <quicksilver> it is broken by design.
01:35:07 <Cale> quicksilver: That part I would disagree with
01:35:13 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Replace solution?
01:35:23 <quicksilver> I know you would. I'm exagerrating for rhetorical effect.
01:35:53 <quicksilver> but this is an excellent example of why it's horrible to have a pure value, the forcing of which causes a painful IO side-effect (in this case, blocking a thread)
01:36:24 <quicksilver> such a good example that I will mention it in my forthcoming rant on the pain of interleaved IO, I think.
01:36:39 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I use postGUIAsync post gtk2hs action to gui *main* thread, still block? 
01:36:51 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: because hGetContents is evil.
01:37:55 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: hGetContents produces a pure value - a String - which, when you try to force it, waits for IO.
01:37:55 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I just think hGetContents is function to get output from "output handle", not know much about it.
01:37:55 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: in this case it waits for bash to finish, because textBufferSetText is demanding the whole string.
01:37:55 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: bash will never finish. So it waits forever.
01:37:58 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: because this forcing is happening in your GUI thread, it is waiting forever in your GUI thread.
01:37:59 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: this blocks your GUI thread.
01:38:14 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: hGetContents is a dangerous function. It uses unsafeInterleaveIO behind the scenes.
01:38:19 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: What? Why hGetContents need produce a pure value? It's not "IO String"?
01:38:39 <napping> ManateeLazyCat: it pretends to give you a string that has everything from the file
01:38:48 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: hGetContents produces a magical string which reads the handle when you evaluate it.
01:38:55 <napping> but actually gives you a string with only a little bit, that will try to read more if you look at the tail
01:39:06 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: and textViewSetText demands the entire string right now.
01:39:24 <napping> as a replacement, maybe you can pass around the Handle and call hGetLine
01:39:30 <ManateeLazyCat> napping: It won't give your "entrie string" when you need "all" ?
01:39:35 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: where 'right now' happens to be before you've even sent a command to bash
01:39:52 * napping returns after lightning and power loss
01:39:58 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Oh, how stupid with hGetContents!!!
01:39:59 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: which means that it blocks, since the out handle isn't closed, and there could be more contents coming along
01:40:21 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: Well, even if hGetContents were not lazy, it would move the problem up two lines
01:40:25 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: I suppose i do something wrong....
01:40:34 <napping> ManateeLazyCat: One bad thing that happens is if you hClose the Handle before the program finishes using the string, then it looks empty
01:40:36 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: You're expecting it to be *even lazier* than it is :)
01:40:55 <DarkUnicorn> chrisdone: okay, so we need 140 of these definitions when we want to define a list of length less or equal 140?
01:43:50 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Why haven't someone fix hGetContents this stupid function that confuse so many people?
01:44:45 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: you will find many discussions on haskell-cafe about this subject
01:44:54 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: some of them containing flames from me :)
01:45:04 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: I like this one from oleg : http://www.mail-archive.com/haskell-cafe@haskell.org/msg21306.html
01:45:27 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, they did - they wrote Iteratee
01:45:36 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Because hGetContents, i waste one hour to debug this stupid problem...
01:45:37 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, and there's also ListT
01:46:17 <Peaker> Haskell maybe needs multiple variants of "unsafe". "unsafe" as in "partial". "unsafe" as in destructively mutate stuff unsafely. "unsafe" as in "non-deterministic"
01:46:27 <Peaker> undeterminsticGetContents
01:47:14 <Ke> lazyIO is really the sillyest idea
01:47:39 * ManateeLazyCat Damn GFW, filter mail-archive.com, one day I will to DISMANTLE the GFW.
01:47:48 <Ke> esp. when you could actually only do the hclose, when the string is actually used
01:48:16 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: sorry, I'll get the haskell link tot he same message
01:48:17 <dolio> getContents is always going to be nondeterministic, regardless of whether it's lazy or not.
01:48:38 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Nevermind, i can round GFW
01:48:46 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Just hate GFW.
01:48:47 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-March/023073.html
01:48:58 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: I'm sure I would hate it too if I was affected :-(
01:49:27 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Why, gov install GFW in USA?
01:49:40 <quicksilver> dolio: I don't think nondeterministic is quite the right word really, but I guess the point is it's OK if the nondeterminism happens 'in' the IO monad.
01:49:53 <dolio> It always does.
01:49:54 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: no, I was just symphathising. I'm in the UK actually.
01:50:11 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: If you like, i can give you many proxy tools to round it. :)
01:50:46 <Peaker> dolio, The thing is, if everyone treated getContents as real non-determinism -- then almost noone would use it. People treat it as *deterministic* but dependent on evaluation order and such :(  and even suggest this to newbies
01:51:35 <dolio> I'd use it.
01:51:38 <Peaker> dolio, the non-determinism here is not of what contents the file has -- it has additional non-determinism of when the actions will be sequenced relatively to close operations/etc. this sucks unless really assumed to be random
01:51:49 <dolio> But then, I don't really understand why so many people run into problems with it.
01:51:53 <Peaker> dolio, so I suppose you never explicitly close the files you getContents on?
01:52:10 <dolio> No, of course not.
01:52:20 <ManateeLazyCat> Peaker: Yep, I am a victim.
01:52:44 <Peaker> dolio, well, programs that don't explicitly close any of their files really don't scale up in complexity very well on today's OS's
01:53:41 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Have any better function to replace hGetContents? I don't want hGetLine, special when bash output many lines, 
01:54:03 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, There's Iteratee and there's ListT (see the List package)
01:54:22 <ManateeLazyCat> Peaker: Ok, thanks, searching wiki.....
01:54:28 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: you have to think about what you actually want here.
01:54:40 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: you want to read all available data, but no more (or, I think you do)
01:54:45 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I want build a terminal emulator.
01:54:55 <quicksilver> hGetLine is not appropriate, it will wait for a line ending
01:55:03 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Yes,
01:55:33 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I want save all output from bash, then i can re-draw those on gtk widget. 
01:55:37 <quicksilver> you want a primitive which will always return whatever is available
01:55:42 <quicksilver> and only block if nothing is available
01:55:49 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Yes.
01:56:02 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Block there when nothing output.
01:56:05 <quicksilver> unfortunately there is nothing like that in the standard haskell libs.
01:56:11 <quicksilver> except getChar
01:56:12 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, short explanation of ListT (not that in MTL/transformers, but in the "list" package): Instead of having: data [a] = [] | a : [a]  ; you have:  data ListT m a = Empty | Cons a (m (ListT m a))
01:56:24 <quicksilver> so your simplest, quickest, solution is just to keep calling getChar
01:56:26 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, so each "connection" to the "rest of list" is through a monadic action
01:56:51 <quicksilver> you could alternatively use hGetBufNonBlocking
01:56:58 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I'm afraid getChar will got bad performance if have many data output from bash.
01:57:07 <Peaker> ManateeLazyCat, Then you can have a safe deterministic   ListT ByteString or such for the chunks of a file  --  where there's an actual IO action between elements
01:57:11 <quicksilver> but it's a bit more fiddly due to being byte based.
01:57:27 <quicksilver> Peaker: that's all very interesting but doesn't solve ManateeLazyCat's underlying problem.
01:57:36 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: I would start with getChar it's simple and will work.
01:57:52 <quicksilver> the performance won't be as bad as you think due to underlying OS buffering
01:57:55 <quicksilver> (although it's still a bit poor)
01:58:00 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: You mean i use getChar build my own hGetContents ?
01:58:09 <quicksilver> once you have it working, you can think about hGetBufNonBlocking
01:58:13 <quicksilver> which is a bit more elegant.
01:58:32 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: No. Just keep calling getChar and updating the buffer text.
01:58:46 <quicksilver> getChar will only block if there is nothing available
01:58:48 <quicksilver> which is what you want.
01:59:01 <manjunaths> http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27885#a27885
01:59:29 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: But when bash output 1000 Chars, you need do IO action 1000 times?
02:00:21 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: Yes. It's not perfect. But at least it won't block.
02:00:30 <manjunaths> in the above code update is a pure function and it takes an argument which I need to get from a statevar. Which is why I have a do statement. But haskell complains that pure function cannot be last statement of do. how do I fix this ?
02:00:40 <quicksilver> you can switch to hGetBufNonBlocking but then you need to handle text encodings yourself
02:03:26 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Any resource i can build my *perfect* hGetContents? 
02:03:52 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Yes, hGetBufNonBlocking looks can work, like your said, i need handle text encoding myself.
02:05:19 <quicksilver> right.
02:06:36 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: pretty much. I don't know how useful it will be though
02:06:53 <chrisdone> an alternative is merely
02:07:31 <gwern> '
02:07:33 <gwern> I have 239 answers so far. This is far beyond what I expected. Right
02:07:33 <gwern> now, my problem is that polldady limits answers to 100 per month, so I
02:07:33 <gwern> will have to wait until August to be able to read 200 answers (and
02:07:34 <gwern> september for the rest). '
02:07:49 <gwern> haha. that's the right kind of haskell surprise 
02:08:09 <quicksilver> gwern: what's that gwern?
02:08:54 <chrisdone> module TweetString (TweetString,appendTS) where
02:08:54 <chrisdone>   newtype TweetString = TS String
02:08:54 <chrisdone>   appendTS :: TweetString -> TweetString -> Maybe TweetString
02:08:54 <chrisdone>   appendTS ts ts' | length s > 140 = Nothing; | otherwise = Just s; where s = ts ++ ts'
02:09:02 <chrisdone> DarkUnicorn: could do something like that, alternatively
02:09:17 <chrisdone> uh, with the wrapping/unwrapping
02:10:13 <DarkUnicorn> yeah, i thought you could use the type system for that. but defining 140 data types is really ugly

02:11:25 <quicksilver> :t \p x -> guard p >> return x
02:11:26 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) b. (MonadPlus m) => Bool -> b -> m b
02:11:26 <chrisdone> hm
02:11:29 <chrisdone> yeah
02:11:37 <quicksilver> shachaf: like that. People do sometimes say it deserves a name.
02:12:09 <chrisdone> @src guard
02:12:09 <lambdabot> guard True  =  return ()
02:12:10 <lambdabot> guard False =  mzero
02:12:19 <shachaf> quicksilver: In this case what I meant was «guard (p x)».
02:12:47 <shachaf> Actually this function would probably not be as useful as I thought.
02:13:26 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: From hGetContents logic? So function putStrLn is lazy? It just need string that you feed?
02:14:14 <quicksilver> shachaf: sorr, that's what i meant to type.
02:14:29 <quicksilver> shachaf: I knew what you meant, I just didn't look at the type sig I got :)
02:14:32 <chrisdone> putStr (x:xs) = putChar x >> putStr xs; putStr [] = return (); putStrLn = putStr . (++"\n")
02:14:42 <chrisdone> putStrLn itself isn't lazy
02:14:47 <quicksilver> @pl \p x -> guard (p x) >> return x
02:14:47 <lambdabot> (`ap` return) . (((>>) . guard) .)
02:14:55 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: No, there is nothing lazy about putStrLn.
02:15:12 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: the magic is in hGetContents, which creates a magical string which does hidden IO when examined.
02:15:28 <quicksilver> (and because haskell is lazy, it may not be completely obvious when the examination will happen)
02:17:24 * ManateeLazyCat I found many haskeller is living in UK, just few people use Haskell in China, shame.....
02:17:56 <quicksilver> yes, there do appear to be quite a few in the UK. Not sure why.
02:20:28 <ManateeLazyCat> @hoogle wantReadableHandle
02:20:28 <lambdabot> No results found
02:22:58 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I'm reading implementation of hGetContents, we can't just remove 'unsafeInterleaveIO' from lazyRead?
02:26:45 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: a normal version of getContents, which read the entire file, would be useful. But not for you.
02:26:56 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: because it reads the entire file it would wait for EOF.
02:27:15 <quicksilver> in an interactive setting you don't want to wait for EOF, you want to return what data you can, immediately.
02:27:42 <quicksilver> the contract of hGetContents (regardless of whether you use the broken version or a fixed one) is to read the *entire* file.
02:27:55 <quicksilver> entire file doesn't make much sense for an interactive setting.
02:28:09 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Looks i need find other way or implement this function by myself.
02:28:33 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Thanks for your help! At least, i won't waste time on hGetContents . :)

02:47:01 <haskell_experime> hello hello, I'm trying haskell, looks cool 
02:47:31 <Axman6> haskell
02:47:35 <Axman6> haskell's more than cool*
02:48:17 <haskell_experime> what about the community? is it as cool as haskell itself?
02:49:21 <quicksilver> haskell has quite a helpful if sometimes erudite community
02:49:30 <Axman6> it's one of the best things about haskell
02:49:40 <msieradzki> why is cuda package looking for cuda_runtime_api.h which seems not to exist in any debian/ubuntu package?
02:50:04 <haskell_experime> languages are great but communities are, it doesn't worth to tell, yo
02:50:44 <chrisdone> hi
02:50:53 <moo> hola
02:51:04 <pastorn> msieradzki: isn't there some libcuda-dev pachage?
02:51:11 <haskell_experime> congratulations #haskell people, you guys have passed my flame and elitism test
02:51:21 <msieradzki> it doesn't contain runtime api header
02:51:45 <pastorn> msieradzki: and there's no README that comes with it?
02:51:47 <chrisdone> that's weird. hrm
02:52:05 <joe_fishfish> ok so guys, i did three haskell classes when i was in uni back in like 05/06
02:52:22 <chrisdone> which uni?
02:52:24 <joe_fishfish> and i really loved it, it was amazing
02:52:31 <joe_fishfish> university of sheffield
02:52:32 <chrisdone> glasgow, new england?
02:52:34 <chrisdone> oh, nice one
02:52:41 <msieradzki> pastorn, on Ubuntu there's no libcuda package just nvidia package with cuda in it
02:53:00 <joe_fishfish> but m question is: what is haskell actually used for?
02:53:11 <joe_fishfish> i know that's a wide ranging and vague question
02:53:19 <joe_fishfish> so what i really want to know is
02:53:30 <joe_fishfish> what have YOU, personally, written in haskell?
02:53:35 <chrisdone> joe_fishfish: i'm writing a web-based paper submission and peer review system in it presently
02:53:42 <pastorn> msieradzki: i mean inside the haskell package
02:53:49 <pastorn> it might mention this
02:54:09 <jaj> haskell is great for web development
02:54:12 <Guest40031> joe_fishfish: parsers
02:54:14 <chrisdone> thingie did a motion detection system and powered a robot with it
02:54:18 <chrisdone> i feel bad for not remembering his name
02:54:22 <joe_fishfish> chrisdone: what does that entail? i've been graduated a while and the alcohol abuse and php has made me forget most of academia
02:54:32 <jaj> all these poor php souls, if only they knew
02:54:52 <pastorn> joe_fishfish: it really excels on task relating to parsing/compiling
02:55:10 <chrisdone> joe_fishfish: well i'm mostly forgetting the notion of a classical web page and it's more of an application. the front-end is all jquery/javascript, which calls the haskell backend with a json interface
02:55:13 <joe_fishfish> jaj: how do you get started with haskell web dev? is there a mod_haskell for apache? an SQL interface? a templating system?
02:55:23 <Guest40031> jaj: is there a dynamic haskell interpreter or do you have to recompile all the time?
02:55:24 <msieradzki> I guess I might have to install that cuda package from nvidia
02:55:30 <msieradzki> the one that isn't in distribution
02:55:39 <chrisdone> tryhaskell.org is written in haskell for example, with FastCGI. i wrote it once and it's been stable since March
02:56:08 <joe_fishfish> chrisdone: json interface to a haskell backend sounds ace
02:56:18 <pastorn> joe_fishfish: there's a library/server/whatever that's called snap, which is for web stuff
02:56:26 <chrisdone> moOo: there's a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) called GHCi, which does interpret haskell
02:56:33 <joe_fishfish> cool, i will check Snap out
02:56:33 <jaj> moOo: there is an interpreter which you can use for testing but after that you'd rather compile it
02:56:41 <jaj> there's also yesod
02:56:46 <pastorn> iirc. they have nice getting-started tutorials
02:56:58 <moOo> jaj: isn't this .. hmm ...slow? at least php does not need any compilation
02:57:35 <chrisdone> i'm doing most of my dev in GHCi
02:57:48 <chrisdone> half of the stuff is completely pure, the other stuff talks to the database
02:58:06 <joe_fishfish> so what sort of persistence layer is typically used in haskell web dev? is there some kind of sql -> datatype mapping layer?
02:58:33 <moOo> chrisdone: by pure, you mean stateless?
02:58:39 <JaffaCake> chrisdone: typo "This means is took to long ..."
02:58:52 <chrisdone> we have to use postgresql at work because there are people using other languages here
02:58:59 <chrisdone> people are using happstack-state, mungodb, etc
02:59:09 <chrisdone> moOo: yeah. no state, no IO
02:59:21 <chrisdone> JaffaCake: hey, thanks
03:00:07 <chrisdone> and it
03:00:15 <chrisdone> it's annotated in the type system
03:00:37 <chrisdone> so I can look at part of my web application and immediately know whether it touches any files, db, sockets, etc.
03:02:29 <aleator> Yay! I finally made haskell run faster than python!
03:02:39 <chrisdone> haha
03:02:45 <chrisdone> aleator: for what?
03:02:50 <moOo> aleator: was that so difficult ? :-)
03:03:06 <aleator> moOo: Took about one month :)
03:03:12 <msieradzki> and what it I want to connect to SQL and have something on activerecord level of abstraction?
03:03:16 <aleator> chrisdone: simple population based ga.
03:03:24 <msieradzki> is haskelldb the only solution then?
03:03:34 <aleator> ghc-gc-tune is just great :)
03:03:50 <Entroacceptor> there's happstack, too
03:03:54 <moOo> aleator: using numpy or just pythonwith arrays?
03:04:06 <aleator> moOo: numpy. It is surprisingly fast.
03:04:25 <chrisdone> msieradzki: i'm using something activerecord-*ish*, but it doesn't work it out on the fly, you run a program to generate your table -> object mappings
03:04:38 <msieradzki> in haskell?
03:04:46 <chrisdone> yeah, called haskelldb
03:04:56 <msieradzki> yes, checked it out already :)
03:05:05 <msieradzki> very hairy types and interface though
03:05:07 <moOo> aleator: ah, this explains it
03:05:45 <chrisdone> msieradzki: pretty hairy I guess but it hasn't gotten in my way yet
03:06:33 <aleator> Now I just need to outperform java and I'm done..
03:06:41 <mornfall> dcoutts_: Hmm. What can Setup.hs safely depend on? I need to fork a process, and System.Cmd seems to live in the process package...
03:07:05 <mornfall> And people are complaining that the package doesn't build out of the box on some systems (I am using haskell98 now).
03:07:19 <moOo> aleator: try overperforming pycuda next :-)
03:07:29 <chrisdone> mornfall: what about System.Process?
03:07:46 <mornfall> chrisdone: Same as System.Cmd.
03:07:51 <chrisdone> ah
03:08:00 <ketil> dons, ping?
03:08:01 <msieradzki> chrisdone, can you store haskelldb connection in reader monad?
03:08:07 <mornfall> Well, Cabal itself certainly uses something to run GHC, eg.
03:08:11 <mornfall> I am looking what that is. :)
03:08:13 <chrisdone> msieradzki: that's what I do yeah
03:08:17 <msieradzki> last time I checked it had a weird function runQuery or similar which ran connection
03:08:22 <mornfall> But from cabal, with base >= 4 it doesn't need process (duh).
03:08:24 <msieradzki> and made a commit
03:08:26 <mornfall> Or so it seems.
03:08:42 <msieradzki> anyway will try it out once more
03:08:45 <aleator> moOo: Well, I've studied that a bit - I've got serious doubts that cuda can accelerate this naively at all. Too much stuff to shuffle in and out of gpu
03:09:04 <chrisdone> data JazzData = JazzData {
03:09:04 <chrisdone>      jazz_db :: Maybe Database -- ^ If in a MonadIO action, might contain the database.
03:09:04 <chrisdone>     ,jazz_conf :: Config }      -- ^ Application configuration.
03:09:14 <aleator> moOo: Although I'm in process of running cabal install accelerate at the moment :)
03:09:15 <chrisdone> it's a Maybe in mine because i don't always run the web site as IO
03:09:41 <moOo> aleator: it is not too easy but it does work - i've got impressive speedup on a GA i was working on
03:09:42 * ksf wonders whether ghc would explode if I gave it a case with 2^32 matches in it.
03:10:02 <sadekdrobi> hello everyone
03:10:16 <ksf> ...I can construct them in linear time, so it's definitely feasible.
03:10:25 <aleator> moOo: which part did you put in the gpu? All or just fitness-func?
03:10:28 <mornfall> Hm. runInteractiveProcess.
03:11:03 <chrisdone> going for pizza, ciao
03:11:14 <moOo> aleator: if you have a good graphic card, at worse, the speedup will be equal to the amount of GPU cores, so it will run faster than the cpu anyhow
03:11:24 <sadekdrobi> sometimes I feel that Continuation passing style is overrated. And it is often a bad idea since it makes you think about the execuation flow of the program and it is less declarative. Am I wrong?
03:11:54 <moOo> aleator: all, both the mutation system and the fitness computation
03:12:08 <aleator> moOo: and prng?
03:12:20 <chrisdone> sadekdrobi: you can abstract away from it, though
03:13:05 <sadekdrobi> chrisdone: u mean using a monad?
03:13:36 <Ben__> So what exactly is haskell?
03:13:46 <ksf> @hoogle (a -> Bool) -> [(a,b)] -> Maybe b
03:13:46 <lambdabot> Data.Graph.Inductive.Query.Monad orP :: (a -> Bool) -> (b -> Bool) -> (a, b) -> Bool
03:14:00 <Axman6> it's a programming language
03:14:04 <ksf> wtf
03:14:07 <moOo> aleator: yes, the prng too - but i needed to use the real mersenne twister so it was not much faster (only 4x / cpu)
03:14:16 <ksf> @djinn (a -> Bool) -> [(a,b)] -> Maybe b
03:14:16 <lambdabot> Error: Undefined type []
03:14:35 <ksf> someone teach djinn induction.
03:14:37 <Ben__> Well yes, but what is it used for?
03:15:25 <Axman6> anything you want
03:15:31 <quicksilver> ksf: listToMaybe . map snd . filter (p . fst) ?
03:15:44 <aleator> moOo: Hmm.. Interesting. I can do with mwc, so it wouldn't be that bad to put in the gpu. Previously I tried with just fitness and it was really bad.
03:15:45 <ksf> yes.
03:15:54 <ksf> why don't we have that as lookupBy?
03:15:56 <moOo> aleator: (i did most of the work in c though, i did not like pycuda)
03:16:00 <Axman6> web servers, operating systems, scientific computation, high assurance projects, etc.
03:16:04 <quicksilver> but \p xs -> Nothing matches your type anyway.
03:16:23 <ksf> djinn isn't allowed to ignore arguments
03:16:28 <quicksilver> sure it is
03:16:34 <quicksilver> @djinn b -> a -> b
03:16:34 <lambdabot> f a _ = a
03:16:52 <joe_fishfish> Ben__: from what i remember from uni, it's a higher level language than stuff like java or php
03:17:00 <ksf> ...but not if its type is mentioned in the result.
03:17:34 <joe_fishfish> so just as it's nicer to use java or php or c# than it is to use assembly, it's nicer to use haskell than any of those
03:17:36 <quicksilver> I'm not sure that's true. It does has some vaguely relevant priorities in its rule system.
03:17:43 <quicksilver> I'm not sure the logic it induces has been studied.
03:17:44 <Axman6> joe_fishfish: and almost completely unrelated
03:18:10 <aleator> moOo: Well.. There would be huge potential with accelerate here, if it really does work. Though it is still plenty of work.
03:18:21 <moOo> aleator: you should see the random number generator example in the cuda distribution
03:19:31 <moOo> aleator: also, you need to know your graphic card (amount of cores, memory, and registers) and see if it is worth it (for me it is)
03:20:16 <quicksilver> @djinn (a,b) -> Either a b
03:20:16 <lambdabot> f (a, _) = Left a
03:20:30 <quicksilver> ksf: FWIW, that ignores an argument whose type is mentioned in the result.
03:20:48 <quicksilver> I don't know exactly how the relevant part works. I should ask augustss sometime.
03:24:59 <aleator> moOo: Yeah. My problem is that the "real" fitness I want to optimize would be hell to port to cuda. Though we publish lot of wankery about standard test functions which are easy to cudaize..
03:26:20 <romildo> Hi.
03:26:46 <Kriminel> ahoy
03:27:14 <Kriminel> i'm an absolute n00b in this, been messing with cabal for 1h trying to compile some shit
03:27:26 <Kriminel> how do i fix Could not find module `Language.Haskell.Exts.Pretty':
03:27:27 <Kriminel> ?
03:27:45 <moOo> aleator: cuda is not really for exploratory programming :-)
03:27:48 <zygoloid> quicksilver: \o/ i now have output looking like this: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27819#a27839
03:28:02 <moOo> moOo: what are you trying to optimize by the way?
03:28:13 <moOo> aleator: ^
03:28:45 <boo_> Greetings
03:29:22 <joe_fishfish> uhh, i have kind of a n00b question that is probably embarrassingly easy to figure out
03:29:40 <joe_fishfish> am trying to install a new cabal-install
03:30:00 <joe_fishfish> so from my terminal i ran cabal install cabal-install
03:30:10 <joe_fishfish> and i got this error message
03:30:28 <romildo> I have noticed that I do not receive duplicate copies of messages from haskell-cafe, although "Avoid duplicate copies of messages?" is set to "No" in the mailing list membership configuration. I want the copies because I archive all the mailing list messages with procmail. Is there any problems with the mailing list manager?
03:30:31 <joe_fishfish> cabal-install-0.8.2 failed during the configure step. The exception was: ExitFailure 1
03:30:40 <joe_fishfish> so uh, anyone know anything about that?
03:31:14 <joe_fishfish> am on snow leopard btw
03:31:49 <Axman6> what error was given before that?
03:32:02 <beni> huhu
03:32:27 <Guest80714> I don't know who made this site, but tryhaskell.org is awesome
03:32:40 <zygoloid> Guest80714: that'd be chrisdone
03:32:49 <Zephyr_> Guest, ditto.
03:33:00 <Zephyr_> Currently... Oh you're kidding me. Someone else is using Zephyr?
03:33:01 <Zephyr_> Bah.
03:33:14 <joe_fishfish> Axman6: previous error was ghc: could not execute: /Developer/usr/bin/gcc
03:33:28 <wolfrubin> So what exactly is haskell
03:33:28 <Axman6> you need to install Xcode
03:33:34 <wolfrubin> I'm just following the instructions
03:33:46 <wolfrubin> and I'm quite entertained
03:33:47 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: haskell is a pure, lazy functional programming language
03:33:52 <Axman6> it's a programming language
03:34:07 <wolfrubin> Sweet
03:34:08 <joe_fishfish> Axman6: thank you, i'll go google that and come back to annoy you if i can't get it working :P
03:34:24 <Axman6> developer.apple.com
03:34:29 <zygoloid> (or more accurately, it's a pure, nonstrict functional programming language, with lazy implementations)
03:35:18 <wolfrubin> Nonstrict?
03:35:20 <Zephyr_> blank spaces matter?
03:35:21 <Axman6> you'll need a free account joe_fishfish 
03:35:23 <wolfrubin> Lazy implementations?
03:35:28 <wolfrubin> I like lazy!
03:35:49 <joe_fishfish> Axman6: yup, just signing up now
03:35:50 <Axman6> > [1..] -- infinite list, that's lazily evaluated
03:35:51 <lambdabot>   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28...
03:35:56 <Axman6> lambdabot!
03:36:00 <Axman6> there we go
03:36:45 <Guest80714> that's quite awesome
03:37:24 <gnuchu> gnuchu
03:37:25 <haskelllllll> very nice: haskell output is included in lesson text
03:37:37 <Kriminel> Could not find module `Language.Haskell.Exts.Pretty':  --- help?
03:37:41 <ivanm> Is John Laton on here?
03:37:50 <ivanm> Kriminel: that sounds like it wants haskell-src-exts
03:37:54 <ivanm> what gave you that error?
03:38:04 <ivanm> *John Lato I meant
03:38:09 <Kriminel> ghc --make -O2 CProxy
03:38:14 <Kriminel> let me try that ext
03:38:50 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: nonstrict means that we can define a computation which uses its own result, and those bits of the result which are unambiguously defined by that computation are then available
03:39:11 <zygoloid> > let list_of_zeroes = [0] ++ list_of_zeroes in take 10 list_of_zeroes
03:39:12 <lambdabot>   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
03:39:12 <ivanm> Kriminel: what's CProxy?
03:39:15 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: ^^ like that
03:39:17 <Axman6> > let xs = 1 : xs in xs

03:39:28 <Kriminel> some tool i'm trying to compile
03:39:35 <zygoloid> ivanm: that wouldn't demonstrate my point at all ;-)
03:39:39 <wolfrubin> goddamnit, I knew I should've done computer science
03:39:52 <ivanm> zygoloid: oh, right, missed that comment of yours
03:39:54 <wolfrubin> Then I'd know vaguely what you guys are on about
03:39:56 <Zephyr_> Hell no.
03:40:00 <Zephyr_> Computer science is horrible.
03:40:02 <ivanm> wolfrubin: what's confusing you?
03:40:07 <ivanm> Zephyr_: O RLY? Y?
03:40:15 <Zephyr_> Well, for one, it's a waste of time?
03:40:21 <Zephyr_> Granted, it's my personal opinion.
03:40:27 <Zephyr_> But these days, with the interwebs..
03:40:35 <hpc> so why are you on a CS channel?
03:40:37 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: there's a lot of theory behind it, but you don't really need to know much of the theory
03:40:49 <ivanm> Zephyr_: interwebs don't teach you rigour, etc.
03:41:04 <joe_fishfish> Zephyr_: can you expand on that...?
03:41:05 <Zephyr_> Collaboration does.
03:41:08 <wolfrubin> I'm in a CS channel because reddit told me to
03:41:28 <wolfrubin> and I'm quite enjoying myself, although I don't quite understand the point of lists yet
03:41:30 <listofoptions> lmao@that
03:41:31 <zygoloid> this isn't really a CS channel. there's more to haskell than CS
03:41:47 <wolfrubin> I am very clueless okay
03:41:47 <Zephyr_> joe_fishfish, how? This is my personal experience, but computer science courses don't teach you much. Granted, they teach you rigour, they teach you how to properly space your stuff, class your stuff - but is that all?
03:41:52 <osaunders> preflex: where clouser
03:41:55 <napping> You've certainly written some code
03:41:55 <napping> with the classic boilerplate associated to some monads, but I'm not sure you've
03:42:17 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: well, suppose you want to represent a shopping list.
03:42:18 <Zephyr_> *isn't that all.
03:42:31 <joe_fishfish> Zephyr_: i don't know about you but the most informative straight CS classes i took had very little to do with coding
03:42:47 <Zephyr_> Then I guess you had a better time than me.
03:43:01 <zygoloid> wolfrubin: lists turn out to work much better in a pure functional context than vectors/arrays do.
03:43:01 <Guest80714> Maybe you're going to hate me for this, but: What are some "real world" things you're using Haskell for? Is it used in finance or in educational areas?
03:43:03 <Kriminel> ivanm ok that did it, now i get a different error: Could not find module `Database.HDBC.Sqlite3':
03:43:12 <joe_fishfish> we learnt stuff like the Actor model for concurrency
03:43:17 <joe_fishfish> theories of computability
03:43:25 <ivanm> Kriminel: then install hdbc-sqlite3 or whatever it's called
03:43:29 <joe_fishfish> higher order logic
03:43:30 <ivanm> Kriminel: what are you trying to build?
03:43:38 <Zephyr_> Believe it or not, we learnt visual basic. And spent 5 lessons on hello world. I may be marginally biased.
03:43:45 <zygoloid> Guest80714: yes, it's used for finance (for instance, at Standard Chartered). quite a few universities teach it, so yes, education too.
03:43:51 <ivanm> Zephyr_: depends upon where
03:44:03 <Zephyr_> I'll give you that.
03:44:05 <aleator> moOo: paper-industry + machine vision thingy for defect detection
03:44:06 <Kriminel> a proxy tool made by someone else with very minimal explanations, also i'm on friking windows :)
03:44:11 <zygoloid> Guest80714: then there's xmonad (a window manager), darcs (a revision control system), various compilers, ...
03:44:14 <Axman6> Guest80714: it's used for both
03:44:31 <joe_fishfish> Zephyr_: where did you go to uni?
03:44:32 <Axman6> quite a few banks are using haskell for various things
03:44:33 <ivanm> Guest80714: it's used wherever someone wants to use it
03:44:52 <Zephyr_> joe_fishfish: Eh.., public IRC and all.
03:45:04 <ivanm> Guest80714: it's not like R or Matlab where it's a very specialised language (though with the usage of GC, etc. it's not well suited to really low-level stuff where strict memory management, etc. is needed)
03:45:11 <Guest80714> zygoloid: I've heard about xmonad, nice X server
03:45:13 <Axman6> :\
03:45:51 <Guest80714> Well,  thanks for your answers :)
03:46:01 <ivanm> Guest80714: xmonad isn't an X server
03:46:03 <ivanm> it's a tiling WM
03:46:10 <Kriminel> ivanm i'm getting this: any pointers how can i fix that? http://pastebin.com/heMTnaBZ
03:46:26 <Axman6> does anyone else feel we're possibly being trolled? we've never had so many people join in such a small amount of time, all asking almost the same questions
03:46:28 <ivanm> Kriminel: what are you trying to build?
03:46:33 <ivanm> and what OS are you using?
03:46:34 <Kriminel> have sqlite3.h and dll in system32 but doesnt seem to work
03:46:36 <Kriminel> Windows
03:46:42 <ivanm> Axman6: IIRC, someone mentioned reddit... >_>
03:46:45 <Zephyr_> Axman6, tryhaskell.org managed to make it to frontpage of reddit.
03:46:47 <joe_fishfish> Axman6, such is the joys of getting to reddit frontpage...
03:46:48 <Zephyr_> Congratulations.
03:46:53 <ivanm> Zephyr_: ouch
03:46:54 <Guest80714> ivanm: thanks for clearing this up
03:46:58 <Axman6> ah
03:47:16 <ivanm> Kriminel: ummmm.... not sure about how to get it to deal with windows
03:47:16 <Guest80714> g2g, it's lunch time in my timezone. Have a nice day
03:47:37 <ivanm> cabal install --extra-lib-dirs=C:\Windows\System32 hdbc-sqlite3 ?
03:47:43 <Kriminel> ivanm trying to build this: http://files.adjoint.org/cproxy.zip
03:47:54 <Kriminel> ..on windblows
03:48:40 <Zephyr_> Just checking. This is freenode?
03:48:49 <ivanm> Kriminel: yeah, no idea how to get C deps working on windows
03:48:51 <ivanm> Zephyr_: yes, why?
03:48:58 <Zephyr_> Switching clients.
03:49:24 <Zephyr_> That's better.
03:49:48 <ivanm> Kriminel: did you read the README.txt file?
03:50:06 <Kriminel> yep
03:50:10 <Kriminel> i'm stuck at the sqlite part
03:50:13 <ivanm> did you read the bit down the bottom?
03:50:20 <Kriminel> i solved the other dependendency with your help, thanks
03:50:23 <Kriminel> yes
03:50:39 <Kriminel> i cant get MinGW to work either
03:50:51 <ivanm> well, I don't use windows, so I can't really help with that sorry
03:51:03 <Kriminel> thank you for the first dep help :)
03:51:18 <ivanm> np
03:51:34 <Kriminel> i am missing sqlite3.o binary if anyone has compiled it on windows and willing to share it please do so.
03:51:55 <ivanm> Kriminel: google?
03:52:10 <Kriminel> tried it no chance for some reason
03:52:50 <dibblego> the quickcheck papers are completely gone from the internet
03:53:39 <ivanm> dibblego: :o
03:53:41 <wolfrubin> This function stuff is so cool, ahahaha
03:53:47 <ivanm> what's the actual name? maybe it's behind a paywall...
03:53:56 <quicksilver> zygoloid: cute.
03:55:26 <napping> dibblego: you mean http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.3629&rep=rep1&type=pdf ?
03:55:45 <dibblego> oh yay thanks
03:55:55 <napping> scholar.google.com found lots of it
03:55:59 <woohoohoo> nifty
03:58:14 <Axman6> Cale: any chance we could have lambdabot in #haskell.au?
03:58:28 <ivanm> Axman6: why . rather than - ?
03:58:44 <Axman6> convention
03:58:55 <Axman6> i did make -au, and people complained
03:59:05 <Axman6> so now -au redirects to .au
03:59:09 <ivanm> huh
03:59:51 <ivanm> sigh: we now have an australian haskell channel as well: #haskell.au !
03:59:56 * ivanm drums up business :p
04:00:28 <ivanm> oh.... didn't want anyone to notice him I guess...
04:02:38 <ivanm> blackh: we now have #haskell.au if you kiwis want to join us there
04:03:07 <napping> Is that for people who prefer to speak australian?
04:03:18 <Axman6> yes
04:03:19 <ivanm> napping: too right mate
04:04:29 <joe_fishfish> you mean the aussies are nipping off to their own channel just as pakistan have them five wickets down inside an hour's play?
04:04:47 <joe_fishfish> typical aussies, can dish it out but can't take it.... :P
04:04:52 <bremner> I bet half the people on #haskell.au are kiwi trolls
04:05:05 <Tomsik> kiwi trolls?
04:06:02 <Cale> lambdabot: @join #haskell.au
04:06:11 <ivanm> bremner: we only have two kiwis that are regular here AFAIK: blackh and hamishmack
04:06:16 <Axman6> thanks Cale 
04:06:27 * ivanm just ignores joe_fishfish 
04:06:38 <ivanm> Tomsik: "kiwi" is a semi-derogatary term for new zealanders
04:06:52 <Tomsik> okay
04:07:24 <blackh> Tomsik, ivanm: Kackers. "kiwi" isn't semi-derogatory at all.
04:07:30 <blackh> Knackers, I meant to say
04:07:49 <Tomsik> if it's not semi-derogatory
04:07:55 <Tomsik> then is is derogatory or not at all?
04:07:59 <Tomsik> is it*
04:08:08 <Axman6> not really
04:08:19 <Axman6> depends if its prefixed by bloody or not
04:08:20 <blackh> It's not derogatory at all.
04:08:45 <blackh> I just wanted to clear that up. :)
04:09:52 <ivanm> blackh: well, some people treat it as if it is ;-)
04:09:58 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: Only *you* can join lambdabot to any channel?
04:10:07 <ManateeLazyCat> Cale: If so, looks cool .:)
04:12:09 <Cale> ManateeLazyCat: Any lambdabot op can, but only lispy and I can make it permanent at the moment
04:13:54 <Zephyr_> Haskell's fun, but I think i'll stick with perl.
04:14:01 <Zephyr_> And i'm off. Nice tom eet you guys.
04:14:45 <listofoptions> isn't perl3 being written in haskell?
04:16:13 <listofoptions> woops perl6 sint it ;p
04:18:24 <Cale> listofoptions: The orignal Perl 6 interpreter was written in Haskell but I don't know if it's being maintained now. I believe the plan is for Perl 6 to have a self-hosting compiler.
04:18:37 * ManateeLazyCat Give up develop temrinal emulator now, i need better "get buffer" function communicate with shell...
04:19:01 <Lycurgus> it was listofoptions, I think that idea has pretty muchr reached it's logical conclusion from what I understand
04:19:04 <ivanm> Cale: yeah, my understanding that the initial version was originally going to be bootstrapped by pugs
04:19:17 <ivanm> but pugs is kinda dead now, as is just about every perl6 implementation AFAICT
04:20:18 <Lycurgus> the combination of its character plus it's widespread adoption should more or less freeze it at 5 barring the personal/subjective factor
04:20:25 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: pugs dead? Why?
04:20:33 <Lycurgus> *its
04:20:39 <ksf_> what would you do if you have a 65536 case case statement?
04:20:53 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: because audrey isn't working on it as much IIUC
04:21:02 <ksf_> ...reducing it by unifying consecutive values yields 13580 different ranges.
04:21:07 <ivanm> if not, it's at least not being developed as much
04:21:09 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: IMO, Perl6 aim is too big.
04:21:20 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: *shrug* I really don't care tbh ;-)
04:21:50 <listofoptions> well outside of that can someone please help me understand the calculus of constructions?
04:21:57 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Audrey is another Chinese haskeller, famous haskeller... 
04:22:23 <ivanm> yup
04:23:35 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Someday I read the story of pugs, then i started learning Haskell... :)
04:23:55 <ivanm> cool
04:25:18 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: At that time i know nothing about Haskell, i just those words : "Code you can believe in" -- RWH
04:25:29 <Lycurgus> "audrey" does not sound very Chinese
04:25:31 <ManateeLazyCat> s/just/just remember
04:25:46 <ivanm> Lycurgus: first of all, a lot of asians typically seem to have an English name as well
04:25:48 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: Audrey Tang
04:25:52 <ivanm> which they use on the internet, etc.
04:25:59 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: 唐凤
04:26:05 <Lycurgus> ah, so maybe Chinese American?
04:26:08 <ivanm> no
04:26:11 <SirTin> no
04:26:12 <ivanm> Chinese Chinese
04:26:15 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: No
04:26:45 <Lycurgus> yi ga nun ren?
04:26:45 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: Audrey is famous hacker in TaiWan, not just haskell......
04:26:50 <ivanm> Lycurgus: e.g. I've tutored exchange students from Malaysia; they apparently have their "real" Chinese names, and their "friendly" English ones
04:27:21 <Lycurgus> right there's a symmetric process for Westerners entering chinese culture
04:27:21 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus:  What's "yi ga nun ren?"
04:27:27 <gwern> reminds me of the argument with ManateeLazyCat / 'Andy'
04:27:38 <Lycurgus> (is audrey a she?)
04:27:44 <gwern> Lycurgus: that is a good question!
04:27:49 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: Yes.
04:27:54 <Lycurgus> ah
04:27:56 <gwern> Lycurgus: first, we need to discuss whether gender is a social construct...
04:28:05 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: But don't talk those too much. :)
04:28:09 <Axman6> heh
04:28:46 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: What's "yi ga nun ren?" ?
04:28:59 <wat> i took the 5 minute tryhaskell activity, i'm not impressed :|
04:29:06 <Lycurgus> i just told you "is it a she?"
04:29:23 <chrisdone> wat: not impressed? :-(
04:29:25 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: I mean which language?
04:29:33 <Lycurgus> (except chinese doesn't have articles)
04:29:58 <gwern> wat: well, did you like the 5 minute tryc activities better/
04:30:02 <chrisdone> wat: let's assume you were impressed, and think haskell is awesome. now, where do you want to go today?
04:30:12 <wat> the syntactic sugar part was more like lemon acid :P
04:30:25 <ABear> helllo, is haskell actually used for more than quick scripting?
04:30:30 <gwern> ABear: no
04:30:36 <gwern> it's actually used for nothing
04:30:37 <chrisdone> should i have left the syntactic sugar part out?
04:30:37 <Lycurgus> or rather the demonstrative I used in English doesn't translated to the measure word yi
04:30:48 <ABear> I just went to tryhaskell but it doesn't seem like a language you would build let's say an IRC client in
04:30:48 <ABear> gwern: how so?
04:30:50 <ivanm> ABear: it's used wherever people want to use it
04:30:50 <gwern> ABear: haskell is a multi-decade long prank by 4channers
04:30:56 <ivanm> gwern: *sigh*
04:30:59 <ManateeLazyCat> Lycurgus: I think should "Ta shi yi ge nv ren ma?"
04:31:05 <gwern> ABear: it'll be the Sokol hoax to end all hoaxes!
04:31:12 <ivanm> ABear: it's a general purpose programming language
04:31:14 <quicksilver> gwern: you're not really helping here.
04:31:14 <ABear> like what?
04:31:19 <gwern> when we're done, the lulz will be epic
04:31:20 <Lycurgus> yes that sounds better
04:31:26 <ivanm> ABear: every other programming language?
04:31:32 <gwern> hm, Sokal?
04:31:45 <ABear> ivanm: well  yes it's turing complete of course
04:31:49 <wat> i want to go to the MTO and get my A-class licence, but i like the tryhaskell site. cheers.
04:31:50 <ivanm> yes
04:32:02 <ivanm> but it's also not a specialised language like R or Matlab are
04:32:11 <chrisdone> wat: what's the MTO?
04:32:16 <ManateeLazyCat> gwern: See? If you use Roman characters (PinYin) explain Chinese name. Like Lycurgus "yi ga nun ren"
04:32:20 <ivanm> it is used for the odd script, but more likely for full-blown programs
04:32:27 <wat> ministry of transportation ontario
04:32:32 <gwern> ManateeLazyCat: I wasn't the one asking about Lycurgus...
04:32:42 <wat> like the DMV in the states?
04:32:49 <ABear> ivanm: but is it easy enough to write full-blown programs in? people write programs in brainfuck as well
04:32:49 * Lycurgus looks forward to a future of computing where the babel of langs will be quelled and they'll all be exposed as hoaxes
04:32:54 <ManateeLazyCat> gwern: Example, Tang i can explain with Chinese : 唐 堂 躺 汤 趟 糖 .....
04:33:24 <ivanm> ABear: we have a DVCS (around way before git was), a compiler mainly written in Haskell, a tiling WM... what do you think?
04:33:26 <byorgey> ABear: yes, in fact it is quite pleasant to write full-blown programs in.
04:33:45 <ABear> well I never tried, I may try sometimes
04:33:51 <ManateeLazyCat> gwern: Just explain : "why Roman character can't explain Chinese name exactly. :)
04:33:56 * ivanm points out that wikipedia does exist, and there is a haskell home page, which is admittedly rather fugly atm due to it being a partial restoration of a backup
04:34:04 <listofoptions> ABear, it beats the hell out of c imho
04:34:04 <chrisdone> I mostly use Haskell to write web services
04:34:20 <ABear> listofoptions: how about let's say java or python?
04:34:29 <listofoptions> not even close
04:34:34 <listofoptions> i hate oop
04:34:35 <chrisdone> Haskell has facilities to give you confidence in your software's stability
04:34:48 <ABear> haskell is considered a functional language?
04:34:54 <chrisdone> yes
04:35:13 <ABear> ok but it's standard library must have been written in C right?
04:35:20 <listofoptions> as a friend would say "programming in java is like having in sex in a fat suit"
04:35:21 <Lycurgus> maybe The functional lang
04:35:23 <Axman6> ABear: regarding your first query, i'd say that haskell is fairly rarely used for quick scripting
04:35:25 <chrisdone> the impure stuff might be in C, ASM, or other Haskell
04:35:28 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Yes, i can programming haskell drink.
04:35:47 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: hi andy :p
04:35:47 <ivanm> ABear: most of Haskell is written in Haskell
04:35:50 <Axman6> ABear: Haskell's main compiler, GHC, is written in haskell
04:35:53 <ABear> listofoptions: you may find this strange but I prefer java over python, python seems rushed for me
04:35:57 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Hi 
04:35:57 <byorgey> ABear: the runtime system is written in C.  The standard library is written in Haskell.
04:35:57 <ivanm> Axman6: well, mainly Haskell
04:36:01 <ABear> Axman6: like pypy?
04:36:05 <Axman6> apart for the run time system
04:36:15 <Lycurgus> python seems like the perl of lisp to me
04:36:17 <Axman6> ABear: i guess
04:36:18 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: I need dinner now, back soon. :)
04:36:21 <cncl> ManateeLazyCat: are we talking about programming haskell while drunk
04:36:23 * ManateeLazyCat So hungry....
04:36:25 <ivanm> ABear: and Haskell could be considered _the_ functional language (since it's much more an FP language than OCaml, etc.)
04:36:26 <cncl> because i'm drunk right now
04:36:32 <ABear> is there something like jhaskell to compile to java bytecode?
04:36:38 <ivanm> no
04:36:43 <ivanm> there have been a few attempts
04:36:44 <ABear> to native code?
04:36:45 <Axman6> i hope not
04:36:46 <mwotton> hey, anyone know what channel the snap guys hang out on?
04:36:50 <ivanm> and a couple of haskell-like languages on the JVM
04:36:52 <Axman6> GHC compiles to native, very fast code
04:36:53 <Lycurgus> an especially ugly thing is clojure a non standard lisp in java
04:36:54 <ivanm> but most of them died
04:36:58 <ManateeLazyCat> cncl: Yes, because Haskell's type system
04:37:02 <ivanm> mwotton: here? :p
04:37:04 <cncl> mwotton: #snapframework
04:37:08 <Axman6> mwotton: #snapframework?
04:37:10 <chrisdone> I'd like there to be a JVM backend for GHC
04:37:13 <ManateeLazyCat> cncl: You can programming haskell while drunk.
04:37:31 <cncl> yeah but it won't comp9ile
04:37:51 <listofoptions> i dunno
04:37:53 <ABear> fst stands for first?
04:37:58 <cncl> ABear: yes
04:37:59 <Lycurgus> was the 9 a typo?
04:38:03 <cncl> Lycurgus: yes
04:38:08 <Lycurgus> ah
04:38:13 <ManateeLazyCat> cncl: Of course, it's need you fix compile problem, i mean haskell type system can check type mismatch for you. 
04:38:14 <listofoptions> cncl i've gotten it to compile quite well while buzzed ;p
04:38:19 <chrisdone> > fst (1,999)
04:38:20 <lambdabot>   1
04:38:28 <chrisdone> > snd (1,999)
04:38:29 <lambdabot>   999
04:38:29 * ManateeLazyCat Dinner....
04:38:42 <gwern> chrisdone: I see haskell<->jvm as one of the signal examples of why academia can suck for FLOSS development - lack of followthrough. how many times now have people written something to do that?
04:38:43 <chrisdone> @src fst
04:38:43 <lambdabot> fst (x,_) =  x
04:38:55 <ivanm> gwern: I still don't see the point
04:39:01 <ABear> what if you want an arbitary position, let's say indexing?
04:39:08 <ivanm> interop with Java libraries: why would you want to do such a thing? :s
04:39:10 <cncl> listofoptions: i'd be afraid of anything that managed to compile in my current state
04:39:12 <gwern> ivanm: har har
04:39:17 <wat> oh i see now, at first glance i thought you had to do 'a':'b':[] to create the list. the syntactic sugar part was that you dont, and its more like python.
04:39:26 <wat> thank god :P
04:39:27 <ivanm> ABear: depends on what type you want
04:39:35 <Axman6> ABear: fst only works on 2-tuples
04:39:37 <ABear> how do you index tuples?
04:39:43 <Axman6> :t fst
04:39:44 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a, b) -> a
04:39:46 <ivanm> we have lists, arrays (a multitude of different array-like types), sets, sequences, maps, finger-trees, etc.
04:39:47 <Axman6> you don't
04:39:53 <gwern> chrisdone: but then, isn't there LLVM <-> JVM interop? maybe you should look into that and getting ghc's backend to play nice with that
04:39:55 <ivanm> ABear: tuples are not lists
04:39:56 <Axman6> you pattern match on them
04:39:56 <chrisdone> gwern: well, I don't know how hard it is. the llvm backend got done and actually works and is being worked on. maybe the JVM is hard to work with
04:40:03 <quicksilver> gwern, ivanm : well for me the point would have been to run haskell apps in a browesr.
04:40:08 <ABear> lambdabot: without going through all indexes
04:40:08 <quicksilver> that would have been a real win.
04:40:09 <cncl> allocation profile for haskell is probably nuts for jvm right
04:40:11 <quicksilver> that's obsolete now.
04:40:18 <quicksilver> haskell -> javascript would be a better target.
04:40:23 <chrisdone> gwern: sure. there's another point, maybe people don't care *that* much about having Java support
04:40:24 <gwern> @quote best.arrays
04:40:25 <lambdabot> gwern says: Haskell has the best arrays around; problem is, we don't know which module it is.
04:40:30 <ivanm> quicksilver: *shudder* I'm not a big fan of in-browser apps
04:40:31 <Axman6> ABear: there's no such thing as an index for a tuple
04:40:39 <ivanm> Axman6: well, you can with TH...
04:40:41 <quicksilver> ivanm: they are really useful.
04:40:41 <gwern> quicksilver: well, that leads right into my next example, the lack of followthrough on yhc's JS backend...
04:40:42 <Lycurgus> FLOSS?
04:40:54 <ABear> Axman6: so getting an item out of it it's complexity is constant len(tuple) ?
04:40:55 <ivanm> Lycurgus: Free/Libre Open Source Software
04:40:56 <cncl> there was a ghc javascript backend
04:40:57 <quicksilver> ivanm: it's really nice to be able to put up a quick demo that people don't need to download to try.
04:40:59 <Lycurgus> ah
04:41:02 <quicksilver> ivanm: and automatically cross platform.
04:41:03 <Axman6> free lame open source software
04:41:05 <Axman6> >_>
04:41:07 <wat> bye guys, good job on the site.
04:41:07 <cncl> which translated core into javascript
04:41:09 <ivanm> Lycurgus: tries to placate both the FS and OSS folks, whilst in reality pisses off everyone :p
04:41:16 <cncl> the problem is that javascript sucks
04:41:19 <chrisdone> wat: ciao!
04:41:23 <Axman6> ABear: no
04:41:23 <ksf_> Axman6, ABear, there's Data.Nthable.
04:41:25 <gwern> cncl: I'm pretty sure it was yhc that translated its core into JS
04:41:27 <ksf_> get it from hackage.
04:41:27 <ivanm> quicksilver: I've heard a lot of cases where even Java stuff isn't that cross platform...
04:41:30 <ivanm> @quote java
04:41:30 <lambdabot> ChristopherHendrie says: Sometimes I wonder if Java will be indirectly responsible for hastening the adoption of functional programming languages
04:41:38 <ivanm> not the one I was thinking of...
04:41:42 <cncl> gwern: was it? i know there was a ghc backend for js though (but it was like 6.8 or something)
04:41:51 <Lycurgus> ivanm, yeah it would piss me off if I had nothing better to be pissed at
04:41:52 <ivanm> ksf: is that the tuples library?
04:41:53 <cncl> i know there was a yhc backend too, though, and it had more attention
04:41:58 <cncl> but i think yhc is dead?
04:41:59 <ksf> yep.
04:42:01 <Axman6> ksf_: and probably not a helpful thing to be introducing to someone who has never used haskell...
04:42:21 <ksf> defines fst, snd, thrd ... for two-to something like fifteen-tuples.
04:42:42 <ABear> oh so tuples can't have arbitrary sizes?
04:42:52 <ksf> oh. up to 7.
04:42:56 <ksf> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/nthable/0.1/doc/html/Data-Nthable.html
04:42:59 <ksf> ABear, no.
04:43:01 <listofoptions> no ABear  this isnt c
04:43:04 <ksf> ...but you can nest them.
04:43:07 <quicksilver> ivanm: the stuff that worked in a browser was fine.
04:43:21 <Axman6> but tuples are defined, in GHC, up to size 63 i believe
04:43:23 <Tomsik> How about we get a haskell plugins for firefox and opera
04:43:27 <ABear> listofoptions: I am not much of a c programmer, I had C last semester, and didn't like it that much
04:43:27 <Axman6> :t (,,,,,,,,)
04:43:28 <listofoptions> i wonder haskell -> dalvik'
04:43:28 <Tomsik> with own runtime
04:43:28 <lambdabot> forall a b c d e f g h i. a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i -> (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i)
04:43:32 <cncl> > snd . snd . snd $ (1, (2, (3, 4)))
04:43:33 <lambdabot>   4
04:43:36 <Axman6> >_>
04:43:49 <cncl> i can't believe that worked, maybe i'm not drunk enough
04:43:54 <def> omg this is the "irc" all the old people are talking about
04:43:54 <ivanm> Tomsik: IIRC, google is apparently working on a VM to embed within chrome...
04:44:03 <ksf> NaCl!
04:44:04 <ivanm> def: heh
04:44:11 <byorgey> welcome, def
04:44:14 <ivanm> ksf: do you want salt?
04:44:16 <cncl> ivan it's native code
04:44:21 <cncl> er ivnam
04:44:22 <ksf> chemicists are going to hate cs.
04:44:24 <listofoptions> ABear, i tried c then moved on to c++ didnt really care for the OO in c++ to tell the truth
04:44:37 <ivanm> cncl: still not quite right... :p
04:44:38 <ksf> llvm in the browser is a great idea.
04:44:41 <ivanm> tab-completion ftw!
04:44:46 <Tomsik> that's because OO in C++ isn't even OO 
04:44:48 <tab> grmbl
04:45:08 <listofoptions> i dunno Tomsik
04:45:09 <ABear> listofoptions: well I probably prefer java because I have it at university since the first semester and we coded a lot of stuff in it so I probably got used to it, not because it's better or anything
04:45:10 * Lycurgus presumes that the distinction between FS and OSS is that OSS could have a fee/price while FS couldn't, so FLOSS would be redundant with the OSS property and yeah that could tick one off
04:45:18 <quicksilver> Axman6: I don't know if there is a limit in GHC but it certainly isn't 63. I got bored of testing around 320.
04:45:33 <ivanm> Lycurgus: FS is philosophic in nature, OSS aims to be more pragmatic in nature
04:45:37 <Axman6> huh
04:45:40 <listofoptions> lol@quicksilver
04:45:41 <cncl> ivanm: ok maybe i am drunk enough
04:45:48 <Axman6> well, the ones in the source i saw was 63
04:46:09 <Lycurgus> that sounds like bs, ivanm
04:46:13 <Tomsik> Isn't it by an inductive definition 
04:46:15 <Tomsik> the tuples
04:46:18 <quicksilver> Axman6: there might be limits in things like, typeable instances.
04:46:32 <quicksilver> but not in the tuples themselves.
04:46:35 <Axman6> Tomsik: no
04:46:40 <ivanm> Lycurgus: why?
04:46:41 <ksf> "free" is beer, "libre" is liberty, and "open" is a herring if done by microsoft.
04:46:49 <Lycurgus> lol
04:46:55 * edwardk gives stuff away, figuring that if anyone has a good enough use for it, they tend to pay me to consult on it anyways ;)
04:46:57 <earthy> hmm. herrings. :)
04:47:03 <ivanm> hey edwardk 
04:47:07 <edwardk> heya ivan
04:47:08 <listofoptions> hmm food
04:47:13 <Tomsik> herrings in OIL!
04:47:18 <listofoptions> ooo
04:47:25 <earthy> nah. raw, filleted, with chopped onions.
04:47:26 <ABear> anyway thanks guys, think i'll go play a videogame (I am very lazy don't program for fun or anything) take care :P
04:47:26 <Tomsik> with onions
04:47:32 <listofoptions> oh god
04:47:35 <ivanm> edwardk: well, some people just keep asking me to add stuff in my libraries without paying me to do so...
04:47:35 <ivanm> ;-)
04:47:35 <Tomsik> well, we agree on onions at least
04:47:36 <Axman6> quicksilver: appears you'
04:47:36 <Axman6> you're right
04:47:39 <listofoptions> makin me hungry
04:47:41 <byorgey> ABear, have fun
04:47:54 <edwardk> ivanm: well, that is the common case ;)
04:48:04 <ivanm> yup
04:48:19 <ABear> byorgey: thankm no matter how many times I try to motivae myself to program, playing videogames seems more inviting :P
04:48:23 <Lycurgus> ivanm, because it doesn't appear to resolve to concrete properties such as that the source codes are available or that a fee is charge for their use
04:48:33 <listofoptions> i wish i could use coq worth a damn
04:48:35 <Lycurgus> *charged
04:48:36 <edwardk> now do so for 20 years, and hopefully the spikes will pay for the rest of it ;)
04:48:36 <cncl> play games nonstop for like 4 years
04:48:41 <cncl> you'll never want to play again. worked for me
04:48:55 <cncl> just kidding, i still play all the time
04:48:57 <ABear> cncl can't play nostop have university :P
04:49:01 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: But browser id not cross-platform,
04:49:17 <cncl> the classic dilemma
04:49:17 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Any javascript program need depend on browser implementation.
04:49:27 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: yes.
04:49:41 <mwotton> heh, I managed to spend most of my time at UNSW playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3. Now I don't even play minesweeper...
04:49:43 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: So it's not true "cross-platform".
04:49:44 <ABear> the LoL server is offline nooo :( have to play an offline game
04:50:00 <byorgey> chrisdone: btw, "Get stuck into a book" doesn't seem like idiomatic English to me
04:50:05 <edwardk> ivanm: started playing around with abusing template haskell to build unboxed trie types
04:50:19 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: but there are good browser implementations for (x86/x86_64/ARM) x (OSX/Win32/Linux/FreeBSD/iOS/BlackberryOS/Symbian)
04:50:22 <quicksilver> (and probably more)
04:50:25 * Lycurgus is grateful that he is too old to have contracted the vice of video gaming.
04:50:28 <quicksilver> so that's as crossplatform as you get.
04:50:29 <Axman6> ABear: or you could learn some haskell
04:50:34 <ivanm> edwardk: cool
04:50:40 <cncl> (for great good)
04:51:01 <ivanm> Lycurgus: having a laptop with a really mediocre on-board graphics card and running linux to boot also helps ;-)
04:51:02 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: any cross platform solution relies on a common VM/RTS. browsers are currently one fo the most universal VMs available.
04:51:13 <this> what is the best: digg, or reddit?
04:51:19 <cncl> HN
04:51:24 <dv`> reddit
04:51:37 <ivanm> planet.haskell.org
04:51:51 <ABear> you need a reddit gold account to view this comment
04:51:54 <this> yeah i think reddit is better than digg
04:51:57 <listofoptions> facebook
04:51:59 <edwardk> so given data Foo a b = Foo !Int (Either a b) | Bar | Baz a -- $(deriveMap Foo) -- should let you use a generic map that is as close to optimal as i can get it
04:52:10 <ABear> Axman6: learn a new language, I don't see how it would be useful for me anyway :P
04:52:23 <ivanm> edwardk: hmmm.... most intriguing...
04:52:28 <Axman6> ABear: do you program?
04:52:37 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Yes, Cloud is cool, I just disagree ChromeOS's idea, that running everything in browser. :)
04:52:52 <ABear> Axman6: mostly only university projects, In my free time I rarely program, or rarely finish a program :P
04:53:16 <Axman6> you're taking the wrong degree then
04:53:24 <ABear> Axman6: you think so?
04:53:39 <Axman6> aye
04:53:44 <mwotton> so, for Hubris: I need to generate different bindings for all the various versions of Ruby I might need to connect to. Would it be a filthy hack to create a cabal package programmatically at runtime and compile it using the provided ruby headers?
04:54:04 <mwotton> I'm having a bit of trouble working out how else I can generate and ship the required libs
04:54:09 <ABear> Axman6: I am lazy at everything, it's not the degree, besides I am doing pretty well in my class and I finish next year, can't change anyway
04:54:09 <Axman6> if you're doing a degree in a subject you don't like enough to be interested in unless you have to do it, ur doin it rong imo
04:54:47 <ABear> I am interested, I just prefer to play videogames instead of programming, I don't see the reward of programming, except maybe for a mark :P
04:55:09 * byorgey doesn't see the reward of video games
04:55:10 * ManateeLazyCat Once you put everything in Cloud, you can't control it, your browser like "modern terminal" that just have graphics code running your box.....
04:55:11 <cncl> you're gonna hate a programming job then
04:55:23 <mwotton> there are a lot of nine to fivers in the programming world
04:55:27 <mwotton> they make a decent wage
04:55:31 <ABear> I was told multiple times to program something I need, but I can find everything I need on the internets
04:55:52 <mwotton> i mean, i find them unutterably alien, but they seem to get by in their monochrome little world :)
04:55:54 <ABear> mwotton:  may go into research at my university, doing academic stuff, and I can do my doctorate for years
04:56:07 <edwardk> ManateeLazyCat: yes, but i don't miss _having_ to control it ;)
04:56:18 <ABear> will only have to do lab stuff with first and second years a few times a week
04:56:23 <ivanm> byorgey: I like a bit of mindless violence to get my mind off things
04:56:32 <ivanm> I'm not any good at it...
04:56:34 <ManateeLazyCat> IMO, Cloud is cool, and can finish most thing, but it's not SAFETY.
04:56:36 <byorgey> ABear: doing a doctorate to avoid the real world is *definitely* doing it wrong =)
04:56:40 <byorgey> ivanm: oh, me too =)
04:56:40 <Axman6> ABear: so..you don't like programming, and you want to get a doctorate by programming for years? :\
04:56:44 <cncl> a bit of the old ultraviolence
04:56:49 <ivanm> ABear: most unis won't let you keep doing your doctorate for year after year...
04:56:59 <mwotton> Axman6: embrace the cognitive dissonance. let it wash over you, and glory in it.
04:57:07 <edwardk> ivanm: that is why you start the next one ;)
04:57:09 <ABear> Axman6: well you can do your doctorate tesis on  the topic of like finite state machines where not much programming is needed
04:57:14 <ivanm> byorgey: awww.... that's what I was planning on doing... :p (r.e. doctorate to avoid the real world)
04:57:24 <ABear> my C lab teacher told me he did a doctorate because he doesn't like programming much
04:57:27 <Axman6> sure
04:57:37 <Axman6> is there much research to be done into FSM's?
04:57:41 <byorgey> ivanm: it's a fine reason as long as it's not the ONLY reason
04:57:48 <ABear> and he has a few hours a week of lab work than he is kinda free
04:57:49 <ivanm> edwardk: I've never understood why people get more than one PhD: once you have one and thus proven your mark as a researcher, why not just get a job as a postdoc and start working on stuff rather than relying on a scholarship to do it?
04:57:50 <mwotton> Axman6: that's a theological subject.
04:58:03 <Axman6> yeah i have a feeling that doing a doctorate may involve writing less code than you may hope
04:58:08 <Axman6> s/you/I
04:58:17 <ivanm> Axman6: yeah :(
04:58:33 <Axman6> ivanm: get back to work
04:58:34 <Axman6> :P
04:58:41 <ABear> Axman6: you can remain at university and later get a professor status
04:58:48 <ABear> and continue to do research 
04:58:51 <this> do u know any social network, site or system that controls all video contents? For example: all videos that have pornographic, violent, or spam content are supposed do not appear in this site...
04:59:03 <Axman6> ABear: this is my plan :)
04:59:04 <cncl> MVC sucks. who thought this up aaaaa
04:59:05 <ivanm> Axman6: writing a blog post about aushac!
04:59:05 <edwardk> ivanm: well, i was getting ready to do the same thing with masters degrees ;) it is satisfying to those who have an addictive personality ;)
04:59:07 <ABear> this: youtube :P
04:59:12 <ivanm> edwardk: heh
04:59:15 <ABear> Axman6: :P
04:59:16 <Axman6> this: youtube...
04:59:33 <ivanm> Axman6: and since you have a free day tomorrow, come and see what PhD students at CECS get up to at the poster day tomorrow! :p
04:59:36 <silver_> theoretically youtube
04:59:39 <ivanm> sohum: you too!
04:59:49 <ABear> well sometimes 4han raids youtube
05:00:03 <Axman6> i'm all booked out tomorrow as it is
05:00:06 <ABear> 4chan* 
05:00:07 <silver_> once per 13 billions years
05:00:23 <ABear> silver_: it happened this year :P
05:00:27 <ABear> it was some important day in USA
05:00:32 <silver_> yeah!
05:00:39 <silver_> 13 billions year after Big Bang!
05:00:43 <ABear> lol
05:00:49 <sohum> ivanm: yea, I'm totally planning on comming to the poster day
05:00:53 <sohum> -m
05:01:00 <this> yeah, i've thought about youtube...
05:01:10 <ivanm> sohum: you planning on joining #haskell.au as well?
05:01:11 <ivanm> :p
05:01:19 <mwotton> it's where all the cool kids are hanging out
05:01:20 <sohum> maaan, there's /another/ one?
05:01:22 <ABear> youtube developpers were stupid enough not to transfrom all "<" and ">" to &lt and &gt but to check if there is a <script> and block it
05:01:24 <ABear> but only the firt one
05:01:32 <Axman6> this: that question is quite off topic though
05:02:17 <ManateeLazyCat> edwtjo: I admit, my point not just technology, it's politics.....
05:02:23 <ABear> not as off-topic as you're mom!
05:02:30 <ivanm> @slap ABear 
05:02:30 <lambdabot> go slap ABear  yourself
05:02:34 <ivanm> grrr....
05:02:35 <ABear> lol
05:02:37 <cncl> hahaha
05:02:43 <ivanm> ABear: childless garbage like that is uncalled for in this channel
05:02:51 <ivanm> ##java is that-away: ===>
05:02:55 <ABear> I realized I did it anyway :D
05:02:59 <ManateeLazyCat> @hoogle sourcePackageId
05:02:59 <lambdabot> No results found
05:03:02 <mwotton> childless?
05:03:09 <ivanm> ugh
05:03:10 <ABear> lol
05:03:11 <ivanm> *childlike
05:03:17 <ABear> I didn't notice that
05:03:17 <cncl> childful is also not a word
05:03:17 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: part of Cabal IIRC
05:03:32 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: I'm try to fix hs-plugins. :)
05:03:40 <ivanm> aha
05:03:48 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Looks Cabal-1.8 change API.
05:03:55 <ivanm> yup
05:04:00 <ivanm> hence the major version upgrade ;-)
05:04:00 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: or is it a symbol from an old version of the GHC API?
05:04:16 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: I already told you that IIRC (that current hs-plugins needs cabal-1.6)
05:04:34 <ivanm> quicksilver: no, pretty sure it's cabal
05:04:36 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: But i want fix it make it can works with any version Cabal 
05:04:40 <quicksilver> cool
05:04:42 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: that's not possible
05:04:50 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Why?
05:04:58 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: however, dcoutts tests all new versions of cabal against old ghcs
05:05:05 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: since each one has a different API
05:05:19 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Why Cabal team do that? break everything?
05:05:42 <ivanm> because they want to improve what's there?
05:05:54 <ivanm> that's why it has a major version number change
05:06:03 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: does gtk2hs have the exact same API for each version?
05:06:38 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Yes, but we will keep old API for back compatiblity
05:07:53 <Sgeo|try> Playing with TryHaskell.org
05:08:37 <ABear> Sgeo|try: reddit?
05:09:02 <ABear> was tryhaskell written in haskell btw :P
05:09:11 <ivanm> the interpreter was
05:09:20 <Sgeo|try> ABear: yes, although I've done TryHaskell before iirc
05:09:21 <ivanm> see the bottom of the page; it says what was used to develop it
05:09:38 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: However, i will try to make hs-plugins works with Cabal-1.8, i haven't time waiting dons.
05:09:52 <ABear> ivanm: I missed that :P ty
05:10:03 <bardun> hello
05:10:41 <Axman6> 'lo
05:10:50 <ABear> hello mate
05:11:58 <Sgeo|try> Should it really be taking a long time to do map (+1) [1..5] ?
05:12:13 <quicksilver> no, that should be pretty much instant
05:12:18 <ivanm> Sgeo|try: well, you're running it on a web service which has to communicate with the server...
05:12:28 <ivanm> which is probably why it's so slow
05:12:41 <Sgeo|try> The other stuff was much faster
05:12:45 <quicksilver> it's instant for me
05:12:56 <quicksilver> (just logged on to tryhaskell and tried it)
05:13:01 <Sgeo|try> Also, at one point, I had to actually type in the next step
05:13:12 <bardun> I haven't programmed before but these lessons on tryhaskell.org are nice
05:13:14 * ivanm founds tryhaskell a pain, mainly due to the lack of :hoogle... :p
05:13:23 <noob_> my Try haskell console has died
05:13:33 <ivanm> ugh, even :browse fails
05:13:39 <ivanm> so you can't tell what's even available
05:13:40 <dwdel> Hi, I wonder if any of you can guide me out of step 6. I am stuck there.
05:13:48 <dwdel> on tryhaskell of course
05:13:49 <cncl> well that's why it's Try Haskell and not Always Succeed Haskell
05:13:59 <ivanm> cncl: lol
05:14:09 <ivanm> dwdel: since I have no idea what step 6 is...
05:14:12 <Sgeo|try> dwdel: for me, it required manually going to step7
05:14:13 <Axman6> or Do or do not do Haskell
05:14:33 <bumface> [42,13,22]
05:14:35 <Axman6> chrisdone: still around?
05:14:37 <chrisdone> dwdel: what's the problem?
05:14:39 <Gracenotes> oh eesh I've been spending way too long trying to figure out how to implement a compare function for a set of tuples with 6 total possibly combinations
05:14:40 <dwdel> lvanm well it just asks to type (28, "chris")
05:14:49 <Gracenotes> *possible
05:14:51 <dwdel> Sgeo|try: how do i get there manually?
05:14:58 <ivanm> dwdel: this worked for me: :type "Sparticus"
05:15:02 <Gracenotes> screw this, I'm going to write a to-int function
05:15:06 <ivanm> dwdel: lesson6 will get you there
05:15:10 <Sgeo|try> dwdel: step7
05:15:14 <chrisdone> dwdel: type 'step6'/'step7'
05:15:15 <Sgeo|try> ivanm: that's lesson, not step
05:15:22 <ivanm> oh
05:15:24 <ivanm> *shrug*
05:15:39 <ivanm> Gracenotes: ugh.... isn't that what lists are for?
05:15:42 <ivanm> compare `on` sort ?
05:15:59 <bumface> I'm stuck on the tuple as well. It's not advancing
05:16:00 <dwdel> ok got it, thanks Sgeo|try , chrisdone , lvanm :)
05:16:17 <chrisdone> it might've been the space
05:16:39 <chrisdone> i had to make it stricter because people were experimenting with things and it would trigger the next step of the tutorial
05:16:57 <bumface> Why not let them advance manually?
05:17:39 <chrisdone> no one asked for that when i did a review process. someone asked for 'back' so i added that
05:18:20 <evant_> http://www.hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27889#a27889 <- I'm getting a syntax error on the line notAlpha char = ...
05:18:23 <dwdel> chrisdone: i suppose you made it, very nice site, thank you :)
05:18:27 <Gracenotes> ivanm: not sure. the datatype is essentially (Foo, Bool), where Foo is a three-constructered enum
05:18:33 <chrisdone> dwdel: welcome :)
05:18:50 <maf> :O
05:18:58 <chrisdone> :o
05:19:17 <Axman6> Gracenotes: you can't derive Ord on Foo, and use that?
05:19:27 <chrisdone> evant_: indenting too far?
05:19:27 <ivanm> evant_: it's indented too much
05:19:37 <evant_> Ugh, I just switched to a new editor
05:19:38 <Gracenotes> Axman6, ivanm: would that I could. but however the actual ordering of these 6 values is complicated. I tried to write an expression that looks up values manually, but that's just not going to work nicely.
05:19:39 <ivanm> the "n" should be directly under the "(" in the previous line
05:19:42 <evant_> Need to fix up tabs/spaces
05:19:46 <chrisdone> evant_: tabs are evil :D
05:19:47 <ivanm> evant_: which is why tabs are evil ;-)
05:19:56 <Phyx-> oh yes
05:20:01 <Phyx-> tabs are very very evil
05:20:03 * chrisdone merges back into ivanm
05:20:09 <chrisdone> ivanm: we're one!
05:20:11 <tab> i'm not evil :)
05:20:15 <Axman6> Gracenotes: well, man up and just write the code :P
05:20:20 <evant_> Ok, got it, thanks
05:20:20 <ivanm> chrisdone: heh
05:20:31 <Gracenotes> yeah, I wrote the code, the one that converts each combination into an integer :|
05:20:32 <ivanm> tab: if there were more than one of you then yes, you would be!
05:20:40 <Phyx-> chrisdone: nooooo don't cross the streams man!
05:20:42 <Gracenotes> it looks ugly otherwise
05:20:45 <chrisdone> Phyx-: lol
05:20:52 <chrisdone> ivanm: are you still at the australian hackathon?
05:20:52 <Axman6> evant_: i noticed you're an aussie, care to join #haskell.au?
05:21:05 <ivanm> no, that finished on sunday
05:21:07 <evant_> Sure, why not
05:21:08 <Gracenotes> Axman6: in case you're wondering, the ordering is (Foo, True), (Bar, True), (Foo, False), (Bar, False), (Baz, True), (Baz, False)
05:21:14 <evant_> I have 2 uni subjects with haskell this semester
05:21:19 <ivanm> Gracenotes: ugh
05:21:21 <chrisdone> evant_: new england?
05:21:23 <evant_> Haven't touched it for about 5 years
05:21:34 <evant_> unsw
05:21:36 <Gracenotes> starting from the highest to the lowest
05:21:36 <Axman6> evant_: which uni?
05:21:41 <Axman6> nice
05:21:53 <Axman6> evant_: you don't have Chak as a lecturer do you?
05:22:00 <tab> ivanm: yes, don't put water on me
05:22:02 <evant_> Axman6: I do...
05:22:10 <Axman6> heh
05:22:14 <Axman6> well, he's TacticalGrace ;)
05:22:18 <ivanm> tab: heh
05:22:29 <evant_> Nifty
05:22:36 <tab> and don't feed me after midnight i guess
05:23:18 <Sgeo|try> step22 didn't like my answer due to spacing
05:23:31 <Sgeo|try> It's one of the steps where the answer is in spoilerblock
05:23:58 <ivanm> tab: and don't apply the banach-tanarski theorem on you...
05:25:03 <Sgeo|try> It just froze
05:25:07 <Sgeo|try> As I was typing :t not
05:26:06 <tab> ivanm: that would indeed be catastropic, although it would be for anything ;)
05:30:39 <zygoloid> Gracenotes: compare = comparing fixUp where fixUp (Baz, b) = (False, b, Baz); fixUp (a, b) = (True, b, a)
05:31:18 <zygoloid> (translate into 3-tuple (isItBaz, bool, fooBarOrBaz) then use lexicographic ordering on that)
05:31:44 <zygoloid> fixUp (a, b) = (a==Baz, b, a) if you have Eq
05:32:02 <zygoloid> (which you must if you have Ord...)
05:32:04 <Gracenotes> ah it is an Enum after all.
05:32:20 <Gracenotes> (so those are trivial)
05:33:22 <Gracenotes> but I dunno, the convert-to-number approach does leave things open to future modification. though that's a neat and tricky trick.. probably use it for the time being
05:33:32 <evant_> Say if I have a function pattern match, and after I've gone through a few options, how do I refer to the "everything else" in: func _ = (How do I get the _)
05:33:39 <Zao> evant_: Name it.
05:33:46 <ManateeLazyCat> Which marco for Cabal version information?  CABAL just accept 1 or 2... can't compare 1.8 or 1.6 
05:33:59 <DrSyzygy> evant_: Using _ means you don't want that value. Put a name for the value, and it's in scope afterwards.
05:34:06 <Zao> > let f x = print x in f "lol"
05:34:07 <lambdabot>   <IO ()>
05:34:12 <evant_> Zao: Pretty obvious I guess, so since it's they get evaluated in order I guess it doesn't metter
05:34:17 <Zao> evant_: Eh?
05:34:24 <evant_> Yeah, nevermind, I gotcha
05:34:30 <evant_> Thanks
05:34:34 <Zao> You're naming your "everything else" _ there.
05:34:42 <Zao> Kind of.
05:34:58 <evant_> Zao: Yeah I get what you mean, fixed it up, thanks
05:35:08 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: hmmm?
05:35:14 <ivanm> not sure I get what you mean by "marco"
05:35:43 <Tomsik> I'm just wondering
05:35:51 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: I mean version tag, such as "#if GTK_CHECK_VERSION(2,8,0)... #else ... #endif"
05:35:58 <Tomsik> Wouldn't haskell be a tad more safer for webdev?
05:36:10 <Tomsik> I mean, if something is not IO, then it's pretty safe
05:36:15 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: Cabal follows the PVP, if you're talking about what API version to aim for
05:36:16 <ivanm> @where PVP
05:36:17 <lambdabot> http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy
05:36:17 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Currently, i just can do "#if CABAL == 1... " i can't compare 1.8 or 1.6
05:36:18 <Tomsik> and you could like interact . 
05:36:34 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: why do you want to support older Cabal versions anyway?
05:36:35 <varsin> halo
05:36:41 <EnlightenedMark> Hi
05:36:47 <Zao> ivanm: Not everyone runs latest+greatest?
05:37:02 <ivanm> Zao: Cabal is pretty easy to upgrade and is safe to do so
05:37:06 <dcoutts> ManateeLazyCat: what is this CABAL macro?
05:37:11 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: For back compatibility? I want hs-plugins won't break old version.
05:37:24 <Zao> ivanm: Even if you're running say 6.6?
05:37:29 <ivanm> dcoutts: he's trying to update hs-plugins to work with 1.8, but also wants to keep support for 1.6
05:37:31 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: I'm try to fix hs-plugins make it can works with Cabal-1.8
05:37:40 <ivanm> Zao: dcoutts tests as far back as 6.2 apparently
05:37:45 <dcoutts> ManateeLazyCat: if it builds using cabal then it's easy
05:38:03 <dcoutts> I mean if it uses cabal as the build system, and also links against Cabal the library, then it's easy
05:38:06 <orium> hi, i'm writing a interactive program. it works fine if i interact with it normaly, but if redirect some input (./main < input) it gives me an error: "main: Prelude.read: no parse". can anyone explain me why?
05:38:23 <ivanm> orium: what kind of input is it?
05:38:25 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: I think dons use some Cabal API in hs-plugins.
05:38:31 <ivanm> I'm guessing that the input is poorly formatted
05:38:44 <ivanm> also, using a proper parsing library would probably be better than just using read
05:39:14 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: But dons looks too busy, so i try to fix it.....
05:39:24 <orium> ivan, integers
05:39:44 <orium> input file is: 15 28 6 56 60000 22 496 0
05:39:53 <ivanm> orium: how are you reading them?
05:39:55 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: Can you help me fix hs-plugins, i'm still Cabal newbine, i'm not sure i can fix it correctly.
05:40:01 <ivanm> I'm guessing you're assuming one value per line...
05:40:14 <orium> yes, i do ivan 
05:40:25 <orium> sorry, ivanm 
05:40:30 <ivanm> well, your input doesn't seem to be one input per line :p
05:40:38 <ivanm> *one value per line
05:40:53 <orium> thank you :)
05:40:58 <dcoutts> ManateeLazyCat: cabal provides macros to let you test the version of any packages you depend on
05:41:29 <ivanm> dcoutts: he wants to use the Cabal API whilst letting people choose from Cabal 1.6 and Cabal 1.8 IIUC
05:42:02 <Axman6> > words "hello world\ntesting 1 2 3"
05:42:03 <lambdabot>   ["hello","world","testing","1","2","3"]
05:42:11 <quicksilver> dcoutts: yes, the point is hs-plugins isn't just a normal package built with cabal - it uses the cabal APi itself.
05:42:15 <quicksilver> well, I think that's the point.
05:42:24 <quicksilver> hs-plugins is opaque to me :)
05:42:59 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: hs-plugins use Cabal API to dynamic-linking package modules.
05:43:27 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: I'm sure Cabal-1.8 break many APIs that hs-plugins use.
05:44:37 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: http://code.haskell.org/~dons/code/hs-plugins/src/System/Plugins/PackageAPI.hs line 61
05:45:21 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: I think Cabal-1.6 export 'package', and Cabal-1.8 export 'sourcePackageId', so i want add some Cabal macro to support Cabal-1.6 or Cabal-1.8
05:46:39 <ManateeLazyCat> dcoutts: And have many Cabal APIs broke, if just change better name, it's easy to fix. I'm afraid Cabal-1.8 change internal behaviour.
05:47:18 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: IIUC, the main reason the API change was because the format of ghc-pkg changed
05:48:25 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: If last, it's impossible to fix hs-plugins, i haven't choose... forking another plugins package... but it's really bad since hs-plugins is so great package.
05:48:59 <ivanm> why is it then impossible?
05:49:04 <ivanm> just fix it to use the new API!
05:49:13 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Don't care 1.6?
05:49:14 <ivanm> (I had to do that with haskell-updater)
05:49:17 <quicksilver> he said "if" :)
05:49:23 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: :)
05:49:54 <quicksilver> ManateeLazyCat: if you can't fix it to work with both versions, then just fix it to work with 1.8
05:49:58 <ivanm> the actual behaviour didn't change in terms of what it does
05:50:08 <quicksilver> working with the current version is better than working with an obsolete one
05:50:16 <quicksilver> working with all versions would be neat of course
05:51:01 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: I got it, use "#if CABAL_VERSION >= 1,6,0,3"
05:51:11 <ManateeLazyCat> :)
05:51:30 <ManateeLazyCat> Hmm, should "#if CABAL_VERSION >= 1,8,0,2"
05:51:48 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: why not just 1,6 and 1,8 ?
05:52:03 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: I try again...
05:52:26 <ManateeLazyCat> ivanm: Yeap, 1.8 is better. :)
05:53:11 <chrisdone> hi stacey
05:53:17 <stacey> hi
05:53:24 <chrisdone> trying haskell?
05:53:27 <stacey> I'm at step 9
05:53:41 <chrisdone> yeah?
05:54:04 <stacey> do I have to declare a variable inside a body?
05:54:31 <michaeliupr> hallo!
05:54:49 <chrisdone> stacey: the "body" is just where your expression that uses the variables go, e.g.
05:55:07 <chrisdone> > let age = 23 in age+5
05:55:08 <lambdabot>   28
05:55:08 <fumanchu182a> So I am stalled at step 3 of lesson 1, I have joined this chat room but now the tutorial is not moving forward.
05:55:18 <chrisdone> age+5 is the "body", age is the variable
05:55:31 <stacey> what if my body is 10 pages long?
05:55:39 <DrSyzygy> stacey: What about it?
05:55:41 <ManateeLazyCat> @hoogle getInstalledPackages
05:55:41 <lambdabot> No results found
05:55:43 <chrisdone> stacey: pages? :P
05:55:44 <DrSyzygy> stacey: Refactor. ;-)
05:55:52 <stacey> haha, ok
05:55:56 <Axman6> stacey: then you're doing it wrong
05:56:06 <chrisdone> fumanchu182a: are you typing it in exactly?
05:56:14 <chrisdone> > [42,13,22]
05:56:15 <lambdabot>   [42,13,22]
05:56:22 <Axman6> haskell functions are usually less than 5 lines long. with i'd say 15-20 being the usual maximum
05:56:33 <fumanchu182a> there's nothing to type
05:56:39 <stacey> okay, so this is all about optimisation
05:56:50 <chrisdone> fumanchu182a: sure?
05:56:52 <fumanchu182a> chrisdone: Each time, you're getting back the value of the expression. So far, just a number and a list of characters.  You can have lists of other stuff, too. Let's see your lottery numbers: [42,13,22]
05:56:54 <fumanchu182a> that's all it says now
05:57:11 <fumanchu182a> bah
05:57:14 <fumanchu182a> i could click it
05:57:16 <fumanchu182a> and it t ypes it
05:57:21 <fumanchu182a> okay i am advancing in the tutorial
05:57:46 <chrisdone> yeah, each step of the tutorial has a little bit at the end to type in order to advance

06:03:36 <myriad> hi hi
06:03:41 <chrisdone> :)
06:04:49 <Saizan> zygoloid: which is a bit circular since System FC got explicitly designed to support all the extensions of GHC :)
06:05:03 <ivanm> listofoptions: in case you don't follow the different terminology we spouted out, have a look at http://web.archive.org/web/20080822101209/http://www.pphsg.org/cdsmith/types.html
06:05:32 <listofoptions> naa i got it

06:13:10 <chrisdone> give me a shorter one than that
06:13:45 <myriad> i actually went through a haskell tutorial some time ago (of which i remember very little), but i do remember eventually getting incredibly confused about the whitespace rules in haskell.  it seemed totally bizarre.

06:24:26 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: ivanm above is patch to make hs-plugins works with Cabal 1.6/1.8. 
06:24:40 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: ivanm I think should work since Type is match.
06:24:54 <chrisdone> why are people still using hs-plugins in light of hint?
06:25:05 <chrisdone> does it offer something hint doesn't?
06:25:36 <ivanm> ManateeLazyCat: you should put < 1.9 for the Cabal dep as well
06:25:37 <chrisdone> thought we were supposed to be migrating from one t' t'other
06:25:40 <ivanm> and that err change looks a little strange
06:25:42 <Phyx-> test
06:26:03 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Yes.
06:26:09 <ivanm> Phyx-: sorry, couldn't read what you said
06:26:09 <ivanm> :p
06:26:09 <ivanm> chrisdone: apparently it can *shrug*

06:26:24 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Something is really different.
06:26:32 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: what?
06:26:36 <ivanm> Phyx2: couldn't read that one either :p
06:26:37 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: I think hs-plugins' approach is bettter.
06:26:51 <Phyx-> ivanm: lol!
06:26:52 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Exmaple, hs-plugins dynamic-linking object file with .o and .hi.
06:27:01 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Use type/depend information in .hi
06:27:06 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: mhm
06:27:21 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Then it can dynamic-linking *any* type that ghc support.
06:27:32 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Not just Typeable.
06:27:52 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: That's mean you don't need change your code to instance Typeable.
06:28:13 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: that is nice
06:28:31 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: More important, if future version ghc add some extension, hs-plugins don't need change.
06:28:42 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: It's best way.
06:28:50 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: can you upload your package to hackage?
06:28:56 <myriad_> if i wanted to filter a range and then map the resultant range, can i use the fap function?
06:29:12 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: I'm haven't permission, i have send patch to Dons.
06:29:23 <chrisdone> ah, ok. nice one
06:29:36 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: Now, hs-plugins can works with Cabal-1.6 or Cabal-1.8
06:29:54 <chrisdone> @faq Can I use the fap function in Haskell?
06:29:55 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
06:29:55 <dafis> myriad_: fap?
06:30:16 <myriad_> hahaha
06:30:27 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: I recommend you read dons's Phd Thesis : http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/papers/dons-phd-thesis.pdf
06:30:39 <dafis> myriad_: map foo . filter bar
06:30:51 <ManateeLazyCat> chrisdone: In it, Don discuss the difference of hs-plugins and hint.
06:30:58 <chrisdone> ManateeLazyCat: i'll check it out -- i'll probably be using it on some project soon
06:31:00 <myriad_> but "fap" is just so much more concise...

06:35:51 <Gracenotes> ManateeLazyCat: without manging the RTS too much I hope..
06:36:05 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: You just need get code from http://code.haskell.org/~dons/code/hs-plugins/ then apply my patch at http://paste2.org/get/922451 
06:36:34 <ManateeLazyCat> Gracenotes: It's base on "native code" dynamic-linking technology.
06:37:59 <quicksilver> after all, that is what ghci does
06:38:04 <quicksilver> (mix native and interpreted code)
06:38:10 <ManateeLazyCat> Gracenotes: Infact, is use OS function do dynamic-liking, then integrate information in .hi file for "runtime type-check".
06:38:16 <quicksilver> hs-plugins isn't inventing this trick
06:38:21 <quicksilver> just adding some flourishes.
06:38:24 <ManateeLazyCat> Gracenotes: And make sure dynamic-linking safety.
06:39:15 <ManateeLazyCat> quicksilver: Yes, essentially, hs-plugins is wrap GHC API.
06:40:08 <purple10> ping
06:40:08 <gogonkt> PONG, now at #haskell
06:40:17 <purple10> yo
06:41:01 <sdfggds> why doesn't map sort "Hell­o" : "how"­ : "are"­ : "you"­ : [] work
06:41:16 <zygoloid> skyde: because function application binds tighter than any operator.
06:41:22 <zygoloid> sdfggds: ^^ sorry, that was for you
06:41:27 * hackagebot wikipedia4epub 0.0.6 - Wikipedia EPUB E-Book construction from Firefox history.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wikipedia4epub-0.0.6 (RadoslavDorcik)
06:41:44 <zygoloid> sdfggds: try: sort ("Hello" : "how" : "are" : "you" : [])
06:41:45 <Gracenotes> or: everything's grouped the wrong way
06:42:00 <sdfggds> isn't (:) a function too
06:42:08 <Axman6> no
06:42:15 <zygoloid> well, yes.
06:42:19 <sdfggds> that's what this "Try Haskell" tutorial said
06:42:26 <Axman6> well, they are
06:42:29 <alpounet> it is
06:42:30 <zygoloid> but it's being used infix, which means it has lower precedence than "normal" function application
06:42:36 <EvanR-work> operators all have potentially precedence
06:42:41 <EvanR-work> potentially different
06:42:58 <EvanR-work> > sort "Hello World!"
06:42:59 <lambdabot>   " !HWdellloor"
06:43:00 <sdfggds> i see
06:43:02 <zygoloid> normal (prefix) function application binds tighter than any operator.
06:43:13 <sdfggds> is there a precedence list i can reference?
06:43:35 <zygoloid> sdfggds: if you have ghci, you can use :info to find the precedence and associativity of a function
06:43:44 <sdfggds> na i'm using this try haskell thing out
06:43:58 <EvanR-work> :i (:)
06:43:59 <ManateeLazyCat> @tell dons I have fix hs-plugins, check mail. :)
06:43:59 <lambdabot> Consider it noted.
06:44:13 <sdfggds> thanks anyways guys
06:44:37 <ManateeLazyCat> Bye all, i need try to test hs-plugins, excited.......
06:44:59 <Saizan> "prefix application" would be a more accurate description than "function application"
06:45:07 <maurer_> By the way, the "Try Haskell" site made it to reddit frontpage, so it looks like we'll be seeing a lot more of these.
06:45:13 <zygoloid> Saizan: except that's not correct for unary negate :)
06:45:42 <EvanR-work> > (sqrt $ 2)
06:45:43 <lambdabot>   1.4142135623730951
06:45:52 <Saizan> zygoloid: damn unary minus!
06:46:04 <EvanR-work> > (- 2)
06:46:05 <lambdabot>   -2
06:46:09 <EvanR-work> > (- $ 2)
06:46:10 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `$'
06:46:29 <drbean> > _2
06:46:30 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `_2'
06:46:53 <drbean> I thought (-2) == _2
06:47:13 <Saizan> we need a word for <non-operator>-or-(<operator>) application then :)
06:47:28 <Saizan> maybe the report has one
06:47:30 <EvanR-work> > let (-) = abs in -2
06:47:31 <lambdabot>   -2
06:47:32 <ivanm> drbean: why would you think that?
06:47:52 <EvanR-work> > let (-) = abs in (- 2)
06:47:53 <lambdabot>   -2
06:47:57 <drbean> I read it somewhere.
06:47:59 <ivanm> heh
06:48:03 <ivanm> (to EvanR-work)
06:48:09 <EvanR-work> its broke!
06:48:24 <ivanm> EvanR-work: methinks it's because of the special rules in place because - is a unary operator
06:48:33 <EvanR-work> thats fascism
06:48:36 <ivanm> > let (-) = abs, x = 2 in (- x)
06:48:37 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `,'
06:48:42 <ivanm> > let (-) = abs; x = 2 in (- x)
06:48:42 <lambdabot>   -2
06:48:48 <Saizan> > let (-) = const abs in 1 - 2
06:48:48 <lambdabot>   2
06:48:59 <Gracenotes> is it lexical in some form though?
06:49:07 <ivanm> yeah, looks like special casing in the case of unary minus
06:49:10 <Saizan> > let (-) = const abs in 1 - (-2)
06:49:11 <lambdabot>   2
06:49:21 <Gracenotes> > let negate = abs in -2
06:49:23 <lambdabot>   -2
06:49:30 <Gracenotes> not lexical :/
06:49:52 <Gracenotes> er great my lambdabot spamming allergy is flaring up again. nice going me.
06:49:56 <Saizan> it's not so late bound, no :)
06:51:19 <B_> sup
06:51:20 <Philonous> Wouldn't that be dynamic scoping? Lexically negate is not in scope at the definition of unary (-), no?
06:51:32 <B_> how's it going?
06:51:46 <Guest5438> huh?
06:51:48 <Philonous> Rather, your redefinition using let is not in scope
06:52:12 <purple10> whois B_
06:52:18 <purple10> who is
06:52:21 <purple10> whois
06:52:24 <Guest5438> I was...
06:52:24 <purple10> snap
06:52:26 <Guest5438> lol
06:52:59 <listofoptions> \whois purple10 
06:53:04 <listofoptions> nope
06:53:11 <listofoptions> thought i could be helpful
06:53:12 <purple10> other way
06:53:15 <EvanR-work>  /whowas B_
06:53:18 <purple10> yeh
06:53:29 <testname> messing with the tutorial
06:53:37 <testname> how do I clear the sort label 
06:53:48 <testname> say I set sort = [12,13]
06:53:58 <testname> tryhaskell.org tutorial
06:54:16 <EvanR-work> @src sort
06:54:16 <lambdabot> sort = sortBy compare
06:54:26 <Saizan> testname: can you link the step you are at?
06:54:32 <EvanR-work> @src sortBy
06:54:32 <testname> #4
06:54:32 <lambdabot> sortBy cmp = foldr (insertBy cmp) []
06:54:34 * hackagebot language-c 0.3.2 - Analysis and generation of C code  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-c-0.3.2 (BenediktHuber)
06:54:59 * Axman6 is pretty sure sortBy isn't defined like that
06:55:04 <EvanR-work> hehe
06:55:18 <Saizan> testname: ah, you just have tu type "sort [42,1 3,22]" there, the point is to let the sort function do the work
06:55:55 <testname> what if I label something as sort and want sort to be an operation again
06:56:03 <Saizan> testname: btw, in general, i think, you can click the code in the lesson description to get it pasted into the console and submit it to go to the next lesson
06:57:03 <testname> okay thanks
06:57:05 <Saizan> testname: i think you've to hit reset
06:58:47 <slowlearner> hmmm, i'm stuck at step 6 
06:58:53 <slowlearner> tuples
06:59:08 <Rumble> yeah its annoying
06:59:09 <Rumble> just type
06:59:12 <Rumble> step7
06:59:17 <slowlearner> thanks
06:59:25 <EvanR-work> eh?
06:59:31 <EvanR-work> tuples are pretty easy
06:59:42 <Axman6> TryHaskell isn't apparently
06:59:48 <Saizan> > ("first value", "second value")
06:59:49 <lambdabot>   ("first value","second value")
07:00:00 <slowlearner> EvanR-work: i mean the tutorial, i was stuck at step 6
07:00:04 <Saizan> they can be anything, not just strings
07:00:16 <EvanR-work> > ('$', Nothing)
07:00:17 <lambdabot>   ('$',Nothing)
07:00:35 <dafis> It seems you must type stuff in exactly as presented to proceed, add some whitespace, and it won't let you to the next step
07:00:49 <Saizan> ah
07:00:49 <listofoptions> :t Hask
07:00:50 <lambdabot> Not in scope: data constructor `Hask'
07:01:05 <EvanR-work> :k Hask
07:01:06 <lambdabot> Not in scope: type constructor or class `Hask'
07:01:29 <listofoptions> the anoying thing is i dont remember what module that's defined in
07:01:45 <dafis> @hoogle Hask
07:01:46 <lambdabot> Text.Parsec.Language haskell :: TokenParser st
07:01:46 <lambdabot> Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Language haskell :: TokenParser st
07:01:46 <lambdabot> package haskell-src
07:03:30 <djahandarie> It's in category-extras
07:03:40 <djahandarie> type Hask = (->)
07:03:41 <listofoptions> ahh Control.Category.Hask
07:03:47 <listofoptions> yeah
07:04:43 <listofoptions> >import Control.Category.Hask
07:04:57 <listofoptions> @import Control.Category.Hask
07:04:57 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
07:05:00 <djahandarie> Not allowe
07:05:06 <djahandarie> d*
07:05:14 <listofoptions> :m Control.Category.Hask
07:05:17 <listofoptions> grr
07:05:31 <djahandarie> It's impossible on lambdabot
07:05:40 <Isa> what?
07:05:41 <listofoptions> huh
07:05:52 <djahandarie> It doesn't have the category-extras package
07:05:56 <Isa> lambdabot?
07:06:11 <listofoptions> ohh
07:06:14 <listofoptions> okeis
07:06:16 <listofoptions> *okies
07:06:22 <Isa> it's okay
07:06:22 <djahandarie> Isa, I was talking to listofoptions
07:06:34 <Isa> yeah got that
07:07:50 <listofoptions> ":k Hask"
07:07:57 <listofoptions> Hask :: ?? -> ? -> *
07:08:11 <listofoptions> what's ?? and ?
07:08:17 <djahandarie> Internal GHC stuff
07:08:22 <listofoptions> i know * is the kind f=of types
07:08:24 <djahandarie> You can treat it the same as *
07:08:30 <listofoptions> oh ok
07:09:02 <djahandarie> Hask is just a type synonym to (->) anyways
07:09:15 <listofoptions> yeah i was just curious
07:09:22 <djahandarie> It's just used for clarity in category-extras
07:09:33 <listofoptions> i'm still confused as to what -> is
07:10:37 <newb> so what is the purpose of haskell anyways?
07:10:47 <byorgey> listofoptions: in what context are you confused about -> ?
07:10:48 <djahandarie> Try :k (->) Int and :k (->) Int String
07:10:51 <peter555> nice
07:10:52 <Axman6> what's the purpose of any programming language newb?
07:10:54 <peter555> work so far
07:10:57 <listofoptions> is it the same as "if-then" in isolationistic logic?
07:11:02 <ranman> Does anyone have a link to a real world project written in haskell
07:11:03 <listofoptions> woops
07:11:12 <djahandarie> listofoptions, no definitely not
07:11:16 <listofoptions> intuitionistic
07:11:23 <listofoptions> mouthful
07:11:33 <djahandarie> listofoptions, where are you learning Haskell from?
07:11:43 <listofoptions> self taught
07:11:48 <listofoptions> got tired of c++
07:11:55 <listofoptions> OOP was getting old
07:11:56 <djahandarie> @where lyah
07:11:57 <lambdabot> http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/
07:11:59 <djahandarie> @where rwh
07:12:00 <lambdabot> http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
07:12:02 <newb> what does haskell do that makes it relevant?
07:12:03 <byorgey> ranman: try darcs.net, xmonad.org
07:12:10 <EvanR-work> listofoptions: FP is even older
07:12:16 <quicksilver> it is no coincidence that the symbol for (->) is the symbol for intuitionistic implication
07:12:20 <ranman> Thank you
07:12:22 <evant_> Is there any way I can do a pattern match like
07:12:24 <quicksilver> but, although it's no coincidence, the relationship is a bit deep.
07:12:33 <listofoptions> ahh
07:12:41 <evant_> myFunc (myType:xs) = myType : myFunc xs
07:12:52 <wli> Logic programming is newer.
07:13:02 <EvanR-work> OOP should be renamed to business oriented
07:13:04 <Lycurgus> not really 
07:13:08 <evant_> Basically filtering a list of items, where I only want a certain subset of those types
07:13:21 <listofoptions> so far monads are the only thing snagging me
07:13:25 <byorgey> evant_: what's wrong with what you wrote?
07:13:37 <byorgey> evant_: but in any case it sounds like you are looking for the 'filter' function
07:13:39 <evant_> byorgey: LParen is a type, I want to refer to the actual instance
07:13:40 <djahandarie> listofoptions, do you understand how any typeclasses work?
07:13:48 <Axman6> evant_: lists in haskell can only hold elements of one type
07:13:55 <newb> So I guess I won't get any answers here...
07:13:59 <Lycurgus> if you consider smalltalk and its immediate precursors the start of OOP and Colmerauers Prolog, they started about the same time
07:14:03 <evant_> Axman6: Wait, perhaps I'm getting my terminology confused
07:14:03 <listofoptions> kinda not quite fully though
07:14:14 <wli> http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/ <-- I'm weird for actually liking Mercury
07:14:26 <byorgey> newb: the haskell.org wiki has some lists of nice haskell features
07:14:28 <djahandarie> listofoptions, make sure you learn that first, it's critical to understanding Monads or any other typeclass
07:14:35 <evant_> I have a list of tokens, where a token can be a keyword, LParen, RParen etc
07:14:46 <newb> thank you
07:14:49 <evant_> I'm trying to include only the parens
07:15:08 <byorgey> evant_: filter isParen xs
07:15:12 <azher> whats this service?
07:15:17 <evant_> byorgey: Pro, thanks
07:15:34 <byorgey> evant_: and writing isParen should be easy of course
07:15:43 <evant_> byorgey: Yeah
07:15:47 <Lycurgus> yeah, OOP became biz oriented with Booch et. all in the 90s
07:15:59 <ranman> Anybody mind explaining very quickly or pointing me to a resource of how parallelization is done in Haskell?
07:16:00 <wli> I'm not entirely sure what else is out there wrt. statically-typed/strongly-typed logic programming languages.
07:16:04 <Lycurgus> but not just
07:16:14 <wli> What's Booch et al?
07:16:43 <byorgey> ranman: there are some chapters on that in the Real World Haskell book
07:16:44 <Axman6> ranman: foo x y = x' `par` y' `pseq` x' + y' where x' = f x; y' = f y
07:16:48 <byorgey> ranman: you can read it online
07:16:52 <byorgey> @where rwh
07:16:53 <lambdabot> http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
07:17:08 <Axman6> here, the computations f x and f y are computed in parallel, and their results are summed
07:17:26 <ranman> Oh, I missed your second link, thanks, I was looking at the blog.
07:17:38 <byorgey> ranman: there are quite a few ways to do it, depending on whether you want task-based parallelism, data parallelism, or maybe just some concurrency/multithreading
07:17:53 <Axman6> so, a parallel fibonacci program might look like:
07:18:09 <ivanm> Did Doaitse just send the same email from two different email addresses to -cafe?
07:18:32 <Lycurgus> wli: the name of one of the principal commercializers of OOP; et. al.  is a common latin abbreviation.
07:18:50 <Axman6> let fib n | n < 2 = 1 | otherwise = x `par` y `pseq` x + y where x = fib (n-1); y = fib (n-2)
07:19:27 <byorgey> ivanm: the two emails are slightly different.
07:19:29 <dafis> ivanm: he did, so what?
07:19:34 <ranman> Do you have to worry about locking resources?
07:19:36 <wli> Lycurgus: I know what et al is. The title of the book might ring a bell.
07:19:39 <byorgey> the second has a few extra spaces.
07:19:46 <Axman6> ranman: for parallelism, no
07:19:51 <ranman> Wow, that is cool.
07:20:07 <ranman> Sorry for all the questions, I'm a fairly experienced programmer but only in the OO domain.
07:20:19 <chrisdone> your questions are welcome!
07:20:20 <Axman6> ranman: what the par function does is: par a b (potentially) runs a in another thread, and returns b
07:20:33 <byorgey> ranman: for concurrency, there is a very nice implementation of software transactional memory which usually makes it unnecessary to worry about locking as well.
07:20:47 <ivanm> dafis: just looked a little weird, that's all
07:20:51 <Lycurgus> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch
07:20:56 <ivanm> byorgey: the only difference I could see was the indentation of the signature
07:20:57 <wgat> wha
07:20:59 <byorgey> it just runs everything speculatively and retries if there are conflicts
07:21:07 <wgat> hireddit
07:21:08 <byorgey> which works very well in practice.
07:21:16 <ivanm> wgat: this isn't reddit...
07:21:18 <ranman> You don't get any performance hits from retries?
07:21:23 <ivanm> wgat: reddit can be found at reddit.com
07:21:30 <Axman6> ranman: what retries?
07:21:41 <smid> sup
07:21:42 <Lycurgus> Coad and Yourdon would be the others at his level
07:21:46 <ivanm> Axman6: `par`, etc. methinks
07:21:51 <byorgey> ranman: you do, a bit, but for most applications I think it's actually better than the overhead you would have had from all the locking =)
07:21:52 <ivanm> smid: is an email client written in ruby
07:21:57 <wgat> the fffffffffuuuuuucccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
07:21:59 <smid> O.O
07:22:14 <Axman6> -_-
07:22:17 <Paczesiowa> I'm really good at that tryhaskell game!
07:22:21 <ivanm> smid: http://sup.rubyforge.org/
07:22:27 <chrisdone> Paczesiowa: haha
07:22:28 <ivanm> isn't that what you meant by "sup"?
07:22:32 <ivanm> or did you mean to eat/drink?
07:22:35 <ivanm> Paczesiowa: heh
07:22:36 <ranman> Byorgey: very cool I need to get into this :)
07:22:38 <Saizan> Axman6: STM retries
07:22:41 <byorgey> ivanm: oh, knock it off =)
07:22:43 <Axman6> ranman: you mean in STM? sure, there's a hit, but STM isn't designed to be high performance
07:22:47 <ivanm> byorgey: spoil sport!
07:22:52 <Axman6> although it's not slow
07:23:01 <ivanm> STM is meant to be safe
07:23:13 <Axman6> it's designed to provide a safe, convenient interface
07:23:25 <listofoptions> ranman beats the heck outa oo doesnt it sometimes?
07:23:39 <Polarina> What would be the appropriate channel to ask wxHaskell questions?
07:23:46 <ranman> So far, I like not having to do all the bookkeeping
07:23:47 <chrisdone> here, i think
07:23:50 <Axman6> there's lots of excellent concurrency and parallelism in haskell
07:24:01 <ranman> in 10 years of programming I only just now decided to sit down and learn haskell
07:24:09 <Paczesiowa> chrisdone: it's not really tryhaskell, it's try functional programming
07:24:11 <Polarina> All right. How do I add icons to menu items in wxHaskell?
07:24:26 <listofoptions> i've only been programming about 6 years
07:24:38 <ivanm> Polarina: here would be appropriate; whether anyone here actually knows anything about wxhaskell is a different story
07:24:44 <djahandarie> chrisdone, fix step 6 to accept any (Int, String) tuple
07:25:15 <chrisdone> djahandarie: i think it probably did at one point, and then someone complained they were entering some tuples and it triggered the tutorial
07:25:25 <djahandarie> Ahh
07:25:31 <chrisdone> as jesus said, no pleasing some people
07:25:42 <djahandarie> You can't make the check only happen when they are viewing step 6?
07:26:10 <chrisdone> okay okay *removes one line*
07:26:41 <RichardBarrell>  chrisdone: I don't think He tried giving people heroin, though. It's not like He exhausted all conceivable methods before declaring the task impossble.
07:26:57 <Jake__> hello, Haskell n00b kicking the tires on it

07:27:50 <dafis> Jake__: can we help you?
07:28:03 <dafis> or are you just saying hi?
07:28:06 <byorgey> Jake__: Haskell's type system guarantees that when you go to kick the tires you will not accidentally hit your shin against the bumper
07:28:44 <djahandarie> unsafeKickTire
07:28:51 <listofoptions> ouch
07:29:18 <listofoptions> i think it's only unsafe when it's over pressured
07:29:19 <madwill> this is awesome
07:29:21 <byorgey> djahandarie: shush, we don't tell n00bs about unsafeKickTire
07:29:33 <Jake__> i code in php and cf all day long and need something else to learn
07:29:33 <chrisdone> byorgey: haha
07:30:32 <ranman> Jake__: I feel your pain, I've got 10+ years of experience programming and just started working at NASA, they have me writing excel spreadsheet macros.
07:30:48 <EvanR-work> Jake__: watch out. if you start haskell, then you will start to hate your job. a lot
07:30:53 <EvanR-work> first hand account
07:30:57 <djahandarie> PHP *and* ColdFusion?
07:30:57 <Paczesiowa> is IORef a ~ a (newtyped)?
07:31:04 <wli> ranman: Sounds insulting.
07:31:05 <madwill> what is haskell mostly used for nowadays ?
07:31:10 <Lycurgus> so it's possible the person that frequents this channel with nick CakeProphet, is referring to the PHP pkg?
07:31:32 <TitsMcGee> Yo, Haskell community
07:31:49 <dv-> Yo
07:31:53 <listofoptions> do?
07:31:55 <TitsMcGee> What exactly is this... Haskell?
07:32:12 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: no
07:32:15 <dv-> TitsMcGee: www.haskell.org
07:32:19 <Axman6> it's the best thing since sliced bread, with nutella on it
07:32:19 <Jake__> djhandarie, yep.  we were orginally a cf, then moved into php/zend  kind of an odd jump, so I am use to trial by fire
07:32:24 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: why?
07:32:27 <madwill> haha since tryhaskell.org hit reddit you guys will have 1000s of noobs like me around
07:32:38 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: because of unlifted types?
07:32:45 <TitsMcGee> madwill: true
07:32:47 <djahandarie> Ah, that's why we are suddenly getting flooded with random people
07:32:50 <Jake__> hello fellow n00b, madwill
07:32:58 <TitsMcGee> dv-: Oh, no lie, it's an intuitive language?
07:32:59 <Philonous> Paczesiowa: It's semantics is completely different
07:33:05 <Lycurgus> the current count of users isn't exceptional
07:33:06 <TitsMcGee> No more declarations and whatnot?
07:33:14 <madwill> thanks Jake_
07:33:17 <Paczesiowa> Philonous: I'm not talking about semantics, only representation
07:33:20 <Axman6> chrisdone: what have you done to our quiet little community :P
07:33:27 <dv-> TitsMcGee: depends on your background
07:33:44 <TitsMcGee> dv-: What differentiates it from Python, for example?
07:33:50 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: i'm not sure why, i imagine doing it that way creates many problems in the RTS/GC 
07:33:52 <djahandarie> madwill, it's generally used for critical systems
07:33:59 <djahandarie> madwill, (in the market)
07:34:07 <djahandarie> madwill, but a lot of people use it for all sorts of things as their hobbies
07:34:44 <byorgey> Axman6: erm, quiet?  I don't remember it being quiet before =)
07:34:46 <Jake__> what site do you folks recommend for good tutorials?
07:34:51 <djahandarie> @where lyah
07:34:52 <lambdabot> http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/
07:34:54 <Axman6> byorgey: :)
07:34:56 <madwill> Thx, i know people using it as a hobbies but i was wondering if there were serious professionnal advantage to learning it
07:34:56 <dv-> TitsMcGee: it's typed and functional
07:35:01 <djahandarie> @where rwh
07:35:02 <lambdabot> http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
07:35:12 <Lycurgus> this is the least quiet of the channels I frequent and by far the most crowded
07:35:13 <djahandarie> Jake__, those two are good, probably should be read in that order
07:35:24 <madwill> i won't bother no more, i'll finish the tutorial and see if i like it, Have a nice day guys
07:35:46 <EvanR-work> ^^ this shows that tutorials are important to language follower gathering
07:35:47 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: you were right, unsafeCoerce segfaults:/
07:35:49 <Jake__> thanks, I'll give those a look and hopefully be back around in the near future
07:36:00 <randall> lol this is pretty cool
07:36:13 <djahandarie> chrisdone, maybe you should move chat to farther along in tryhaskell :P
07:36:14 <byorgey> greetings randall
07:36:18 <Axman6> how would you know, we haven't said anything yet
07:36:28 <EvanR-work> if tutorials exist and are bad, then people will hate it and leave before learning anything about it
07:36:32 <randall> greetings
07:36:42 <EvanR-work> if tutorials dont exist they are forced to read a whole book
07:37:01 <djahandarie> I hate reading books
07:37:09 <TitsMcGee> I can't read
07:37:33 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: ah, wait, the point is that you need an indirection anyhow, otherwise when you do "do ref <- newIORef a; writeIORef ref b" if ref was just a newtyped the writeIORef should actually rewrite the representation of 'a' with 'b' and other things referring to 'a' directly would now refer to 'b', even if they weren't accessing a through ref
07:38:17 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: while currently ref <- newIORef a makes ref a pointer to a, so writeIORef can just change that pointer to point to b
07:38:37 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: but most things are pointers already
07:39:00 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: e.g. second field of cons
07:39:36 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: a constructor references other things with pointers, and that's exactly why you can't do IORef as a newtype
07:40:11 <Paczesiowa> I've seen this tail-recursive map in ocaml that was based on unsafeCoerce and implementation detail of IORef a ~ a
07:40:23 <EvanR-work> nice
07:40:38 <EvanR-work> C has join #haskell
07:41:46 <Paczesiowa> Saizan: I don't get it. cons has a pointer to another list, if we could cast that pointer to IORef we could switch tails
07:42:10 <newguy> hi :)
07:42:26 <Axman6> 'lo
07:42:44 <listofoptions> what do algebraic data types look like in terms of lambda calc?
07:43:03 <EvanR-work> tagged union
07:43:26 <listofoptions> huh
07:43:33 <Paczesiowa> > let l = [1..5] :: [Int]; tl_ref = unsafeCoerce $ tail l :: IORef [Int] in modifyIORef tl_ref tail
07:43:34 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: type constructor or class `IORef'Not in scope: `unsafeCoerce'...
07:43:54 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: ah, in that case yes, it'd work, but that's only because you're modifying the reference inside cons, not because a list by itself can be considered a reference to a list
07:44:26 <listofoptions> i figured it looked like: \fx -> (f x)
07:44:46 <deech> Hi all, when I compile a program using ghc --make ..., since it is statically linked can I distribute the executable without the user having the dependencies? 
07:45:08 <Paczesiowa> deech: try ldd on resulting binary
07:45:12 <chrisdone> deech: haskell's deps are statically linked, so you can distrib yeah
07:45:16 <Saizan> Paczesiowa: and still maintain ref. transparency for other uses of that list, i mean
07:45:31 <Paczesiowa> deech: they still need glibc and libgmp
07:45:36 <chrisdone> deech: if you use a library that dynamically links, e.g. postgresql or opengl or fastcgi, they'll need them
07:45:44 <Guest72640> why is haskell so hard?
07:45:45 <djahandarie> chrisdone, how is your server doing under the load
07:45:50 <chrisdone> i think glibc and libbmp are more or less standard though
07:45:53 <Axman6> Guest72640: it's not
07:45:56 <Paczesiowa> Guest72640: it's different
07:45:58 <chrisdone> Guest72640: it's hard for people coming from dynamic or imperative languages
07:46:07 <chrisdone> djahandarie: water off a duck's back
07:46:09 <deech> Are glibc and libgmp standard on Windows?
07:46:13 <dafis> Guest42356: It's soft and furry, actually
07:46:36 <dafis> deech: I think not
07:46:37 <chrisdone> deech: i don't think so -- but they come with mingw, iirc. i don't know about haskell dev on windows
07:46:42 <Paczesiowa> deech: I was talking about linux, I have no idea about windows
07:47:47 <Guest72640> what language can haskell best be compared to?
07:47:57 <listofoptions> ml
07:47:58 <deech> Guest72640: Aramaic
07:48:04 <Guest72640> never heard of it
07:48:11 <Guest72640> programming language
07:48:12 <joe_fishfish> rofl
07:48:18 <wootwoot> lol
07:48:23 <Axman6> OCaml, erlang
07:48:26 <Guest72640> OK OK OK YOU GOT ME
07:48:34 <Axman6> lambda calculus
07:48:47 <listofoptions> particularly HM
07:49:48 <zac> what am i doing here
07:50:30 <Guest72640> haskell nerds are mean
07:50:35 <Guest72640> why are they so mean?
07:50:41 <Guest59492> i dont know.
07:50:44 <dafis> goodness, why is everybody re-nicking themselves Guestxxxxx?
07:50:58 <zaccccccc> i fixed mine
07:51:00 <zaccccccc> happy?
07:51:04 <dafis> Guest72640: who is mean?
07:51:25 <zaccccccc> what is everyone doing today?
07:51:29 <zaccccccc> i'm at work :[ EST
07:51:36 <listofoptions> trying not to sleep
07:51:44 <dafis> zaccccccc: thanks, it's easier to tell people apart if they're not all called nearly the same
07:51:55 <chrisdone> djahandarie: http://i.imgur.com/Auc6g.png
07:53:11 <djahandarie> chrisdone, hehe nice
07:53:24 <djahandarie> chrisdone, I think there may be problems in Opera
07:53:32 <listofoptions> the calculus of constructions is quite ridiculous
07:53:43 <djahandarie> It's very annoying that reddit doesn't let me post comments more quickly
07:54:08 <Saizan> dafis: if you use a registered nick freenode changes it automatically
07:54:19 <Radiant> hi ppl
07:54:34 <dafis> Saizan: aha
07:54:45 <dafis> hi Radiant
07:54:50 <Philippa> listofoptions: how so?
07:55:12 <listofoptions> Philippa, i dont understand it
07:55:17 <listofoptions> well not all of it
07:55:23 <listofoptions> aww
07:55:27 <listofoptions> no more boobies
07:56:24 <chrisdone> > join (*) 3
07:56:25 <lambdabot>   9
07:56:55 <evant_> Is there any quick way to pattern match a list with an odd number of elements?
07:57:39 <Paczesiowa> guard?
07:57:47 <evant_> Duh, of course
07:57:54 <Paczesiowa> f l | odd (length l) = 
07:57:55 <evant_> Sorry, I haven't done this stuff for such a long time
07:58:21 <Paczesiowa> don't worry, it's like stealing a bike!
07:59:17 <listofoptions> care to help me Philippa ?
07:59:19 <listofoptions> ;p
08:00:16 <Philippa> well, if you don't have a pair of your own, there's always hormone therapy or surgery?
08:00:36 <Lycurgus> boobies and titsmcgee were likely the same troll
08:00:51 <listofoptions> lmao
08:00:57 <listofoptions> on the Coc
08:01:03 <dragondrop> hullo?
08:01:04 <listofoptions> well
08:01:11 <listofoptions> calculus of contructions
08:01:20 <jmcarthur> looks like a lot of people are trying haskell
08:01:21 <Philippa> listofoptions: is it that corner of the lambda cube you're not getting, or one of the axes?
08:01:23 <Paczesiowa> listofoptions: you don't have to understand coc to use it
08:01:33 <dragondrop> lots of people are trying it cos it's just hit popurls
08:01:45 <dragondrop> ( http://tryhaskell.org/ )
08:01:53 <djahandarie> jmcarthur, it is on the reddit frontpage
08:01:58 <listofoptions> well i'de like to try to emplement it in haskell to get to know haskell better
08:02:02 <jmcarthur> yes, my wife showed me that
08:02:25 <listofoptions> although there are better ways of learning i know
08:02:48 <applicative> chrisdone, man, the 'network usage' is stunning. congratulations!
08:02:53 <Philippa> listofoptions: do it the dumb way then, with a Map Identifier Term and a Map Identifier Type for an environment (or association lists if you really cba) and just translate the inference rules by hand
08:03:15 <Philippa> you might find it helps to do either the dependent axis alone or Fomega first
08:03:24 <listofoptions> taht's the thing
08:03:37 <jmcarthur> tryhaskell.org doesn't seem to be loading for me though :(
08:04:02 <listofoptions> i dont fully understand intuitionistic logic
08:04:06 <Philippa> you'll end up with a typecheck function and an evaluate function and the typechecker will call the evaluation function. You can call evaluation beta-normalisation if you want, you only compare beta-normalised terms for alpha-equality
08:04:13 <wabbbbafet> SO many penguins, so little time.
08:04:13 <benc___> oh huh dependent types are only one of the axes of the cube
08:04:20 <Tomsik__> it's logic without not not x -> x
08:04:30 <Philippa> you don't need to :-) You just need to read off the inference rules from somewhere (a copy of TaPL, say)
08:04:50 <djahandarie> jmcarthur, loading pretty snappy here
08:04:56 <listofoptions> oh i have the original paper on the Coc
08:05:12 <applicative> jmcarthur, oh i had it a minute ago, then left. maybe its uneven? 
08:05:13 <listofoptions> but i dont know how to parse it at all ;__;
08:05:17 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: it loads for me instantly. is the dns working?
08:05:21 <Tomsik__> (and p and not p being always true and (p => false) -> p )
08:05:26 <listofoptions> but ok Philippa 
08:05:27 <Philippa> don't use the original paper, it's probably not the nicest presentation for you
08:05:45 <jmcarthur> trying it again loaded instantly
08:05:52 <applicative> chrisdone I see, so you think it's bearing up?  Amazing
08:05:53 <listofoptions> TaPL/
08:05:54 <Philippa> you want something that's been digested thoroughly and re-presented for a wider audience
08:05:59 <listofoptions> *TaPL?
08:06:03 <Philippa> Pierce's Types and Programming Languages
08:06:08 <listofoptions> ohh
08:06:32 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: i love how you integrated starting the chat into the console
08:06:44 <djahandarie> chrisdone, I guess we'll find out if that weird thing with files building up in /tmp happens for all mueval/hint instances
08:07:00 <djahandarie> Because it was happening on lambdabot at one point I believe
08:07:03 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: thanks, i was wondering if people would actually do it, and they did!
08:07:13 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: looks like the idea to use the name given by the user in the tutorial as a default nick fell through though? :(
08:07:23 <listofoptions> i've been trying to find a "for dummies" version but wierdly enough the original paper is the easiest to make sense of
08:07:43 <listofoptions> at least to me
08:07:46 <Lycurgus> haskell for dummies ain't happenin
08:07:53 <listofoptions> naa
08:07:57 <listofoptions> Coc for dummies
08:08:00 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: yeah, couldn't talk to the iframe to add it as a suggestion
08:08:05 <Twey> We have LYAH…
08:08:15 <chrisdone> applicative: water off a duck's back: http://i.imgur.com/Auc6g.png
08:08:27 <listofoptions> and i could see a haskell for dummies 
08:08:33 <Lycurgus> rwh is prolly as close as you can get to that or maybe the wikibook
08:08:39 <listofoptions> would be pretty good
08:08:40 <Philippa> listofoptions: I take it you've got TaPL?
08:08:47 <listofoptions> i'm getting it
08:09:19 <Philippa> cool. It only goes as far Fomega in detail, but it presents the lambda cube at the end and covers a lot of stuff about subtyping as well
08:09:40 <Philippa> ATTaPL (Advanced Topics in...) is a nice survey of things as they were at the time, too
08:09:51 <applicative> jmcarthur, how is try haskell integrating chat?  I'm not seeing what you mean.
08:10:01 <bitch> interesting
08:10:16 <jmcarthur> applicative: finish the step where you enter your name and then read the text below it
08:10:25 <bitch> i just did
08:10:31 <bitch> Hi there, bitch. What a pretty name indeed
08:10:40 <jmcarthur> i just meant that it's neat that the way to start chat is by typing into the console instead of clicking a link or something
08:11:07 <jmcarthur> bitch: an excellent choice of nick for trolling us from the web interface ;)
08:11:39 <listofoptions> Philippa, got a link for "Pierce's Types and Programming Languages"
08:11:41 <listofoptions> ?
08:11:46 <applicative> does it follow from the nick that bitch is a troll?
08:12:02 <jmcarthur> i did not intent to imply that
08:12:03 <Lycurgus> y
08:12:05 <jmcarthur> *intend
08:12:39 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: i think it's a good testement to haskell's stability :-P running tail -f on the request logs greeping for evals (typing expression and hitting enter) and it's about 3/sec
08:12:40 <applicative> > reverse "bitch" -- more tasteful maybe
08:12:41 <Lycurgus> there a names that are clearly troll indicative, some more  or less so than others
08:12:42 <lambdabot>   "hctib"
08:12:47 <Lycurgus> *are names
08:12:54 <Philippa> listofoptions: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/ , obtained by googling tapl
08:14:04 <Lycurgus> in fact, even here there are choices which can prolly get you kick banned pretty quickly

08:14:46 <DAS> hi
08:14:47 <djahandarie> Lycurgus, no one has been yet.
08:14:56 <djahandarie> And it'd be best to keep it that way :)
08:15:04 <asefasdf> ERLANG ALL THE WAY!
08:15:07 <quicksilver> Lycurgus: we don't do much of that. We're a pretty welcoming channel.
08:15:21 <Lycurgus> i believe I've seen it happen at least once or twice in the last 5 years
08:15:31 <Lycurgus> (i.e. in this channel)
08:15:39 <djahandarie> Lycurgus, I meant recently, heh.
08:15:42 <Lycurgus> kind of inevitable given it's size
08:15:57 <Philippa> once or twice in 5 years isn't a lot
08:16:10 <chrisdone> hi das
08:16:16 <djahandarie> asdfasdf, Erlang is nice, yeah.
08:16:34 <lol> damn this interface is slick

08:17:15 <Lycurgus> no it isn't and it's my impression it tends to be people looking at lists and choosing well populated channels
08:18:00 <djahandarie> Even so, this is Freenode so we usually end up having a nice conversation anyways. :P

08:20:15 <Tomsik__> In fact I'm bored enough to ask on another channel for ideas to code
08:20:19 <applicative> Phyx-, I think the "Try Haskell" mood is contagious....
08:20:36 <solilo> This tryhaskell.org site froze up when I typed "ext"; what does "ext" do?
08:20:45 <Phyx-> applicative: what a name like "applicative" I assume you already tried it :P
08:20:55 <djahandarie> solilo, nothing in particular, it may have just been a fluke
08:21:07 <solilo> ok
08:21:10 <djahandarie> solilo, out of curiosity, what browser are you using?
08:21:16 <solilo> Firefox on OS X
08:21:27 <solilo> 3.5.10
08:21:31 <Tomsik__> Maybe any of you have any ideas as to what to code?

08:21:57 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: `ext'
08:22:07 <djahandarie> Yes
08:22:17 <kuribas> Can I have a class declaration inside a data definition?
08:22:26 <quicksilver> no.
08:22:29 <applicative> oh my god, heresy
08:22:31 <Phyx-> solilo: did it do it after you pressed "ok" to dismiss the compile error box?
08:22:43 <quicksilver> classes and datas are always toplevel
08:22:53 <djahandarie> chrisdone, seems like there are occasional freezes 
08:23:12 <rob___> looks like python so far
08:23:18 <solilo> Phyx-, it didn't show an error box; it just did nothing. But I can't reproduce the problem after resetting the website.
08:23:19 * applicative is declaring a type family inside his new definition of fib :: Int -> Int
08:23:52 <kuribas> like this: data Site = Site {template :: (ArrowXml a) => a XmlTree XmlTree}
08:23:55 <applicative> kuribas, people sometimes complain that you cant define data types and classes in ghci 
08:24:03 <Phyx-> djahandarie: well, mine always freezes after an error, I've been trying to trace it, but I know nothing about jquery and very little javascript :P
08:24:03 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf
08:24:16 <Phyx-> solilo: ah, I was wondering if it was the same as me
08:24:22 <kuribas> applicative: it doesn't bother me.
08:24:26 <djahandarie> Phyx-, what browser?
08:24:47 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: apropos of what?
08:25:01 <Phyx-> djahandarie: IE8
08:25:02 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: top level of classes
08:25:03 <quicksilver> kuribas: oh, a constraint inside a type. Yes you can do that but don't, it doesn't work well.
08:25:13 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: sure. It's not hard to imagine other systems :)
08:25:17 <fcknkllr> lesson2
08:25:29 <fcknkllr> what exactly is this for?
08:25:32 <applicative> fcknkllr, good work!
08:25:33 <quicksilver> kuribas: actually it works as an existential
08:25:39 <kuribas> quicksilver: so I should fix the type?
08:25:41 <quicksilver> maybe that's what you meant
08:25:46 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: imaging is easy. Oleg has implemented local instances
08:25:51 <applicative> fcknkllr, what is what for
08:25:57 <djahandarie> Ahhh
08:25:59 <fcknkllr> haskell?
08:26:02 <quicksilver> you're just missing a forall a. to make it an existention
08:26:09 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: yes, I am aware of that :)
08:26:11 <kuribas> quicksilver: I see.
08:26:15 <djahandarie> chrisdone, when you do that transparency thing for the error box it mucks up IE8
08:26:27 <applicative> fcknkllr, it is a programming language, so it can launch missles, calculate etc.
08:26:29 <Phyx-> djahandarie: yeah i've been thinking about that too
08:26:33 <Phyx-> it might be the blur
08:26:56 <EvanR-work> it can compute any computable function
08:26:56 <Phyx-> you can see it try to transition
08:26:57 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: are you aware or do you fully understand that trick? I could use some explanations
08:27:02 <Phyx-> and when I have a debugger enabled
08:27:08 <Phyx-> and i step through the code
08:27:18 <Phyx-> it works, because presumable I never see the blur
08:27:29 <djahandarie> Debugging in IE is a hassle
08:27:44 <Phyx-> djahandarie: why? it's about the same as firebug
08:27:57 <EvanR-work> IE9 ?
08:27:59 <Paczesiowa> community.haskell.org is up!
08:28:00 <Phyx-> IE8
08:28:05 <EvanR-work> ah, that garbage
08:28:10 <Phyx-> *sigh*
08:28:11 <djahandarie> Phyx-, older versions
08:28:28 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: I'm aware and I read the paper a long time ago. I don't claim to know the details. 
08:28:28 * applicative though EvanR was calling community.haskell.org garbage
08:28:37 <EvanR-work> lol
08:28:40 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: local instances are a bad idea in any case :)
08:28:49 <Phyx-> alot of hate...
08:29:11 <Isaiahs> So any one gay
08:29:28 <applicative> Isaiahs, what do you mean?
08:29:34 <Phyx-> but then again, given the state of haskell on windows in general, i expected no less :)
08:29:48 <Isaiahs> Like guys
08:30:00 <Runar> Isaiahs: Any one? I pick the first one.
08:30:10 <Isaiahs> Me
08:30:16 <applicative> Isaiahs:  I read there are in the newspaper...
08:30:33 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: why?
08:31:18 <Isaiahs> Runar where do u live
08:31:21 <jmcarthur> i wonder how many people are going through tryhaskell without even knowing why they clicked it, it being on the reddit front page and everything
08:31:42 <djahandarie> Yeah lol
08:31:46 <jmcarthur> Isaiahs: this channel is for talking about haskell
08:31:51 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: because type classes are used to guarantee invariants.
08:31:54 <Runar> Isaiahs: I hear u live in words like "undulation".
08:32:13 <Isaiahs> Nope Texas
08:32:20 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: the entire purpose of type classes is to have a global association between a type and a dictionary
08:32:36 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: and this can be used to guarantee sound-ness of certain associations.
08:32:39 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: there's no "and they can't be used for anything else"
08:32:44 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: break this property and you no longer need type classes
08:32:52 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: just pass an explicit dictionary, which is simpler.
08:32:55 <Runar> Isaiahs: Haskell, Texas?
08:33:11 <Philippa> quicksilver: I don't entirely agree, but you do need a more complex type system to manage it if you break it
08:33:15 <Isaiahs> No mesquite
08:33:28 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: pass an explicit dictionary? that is boilerplate!
08:33:33 <applicative> Isaiahs, in the west of Texas?
08:33:54 * Phyx- kicks his code, work damnit
08:33:58 <Isaiahs> East near Dallas
08:34:05 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: there are ways of removing the boilerplate, as always.
08:34:12 <Philippa> you need a way for datatypes that care about which instance they work with to make sure they're working with the right one. ML does it by creating a new type when you instantiate the functor
08:34:29 <applicative> Phyx- what are you working on.   I'm doing missionary work....
08:34:50 <quicksilver> Philippa: sure. There are more sophisticated settings possible. My contention is that typeclasses are what they are, and other things are, well, other things :)
08:34:52 <Philippa> if you remove that requirement then type classes are effectively about proof building
08:34:54 <Phyx-> applicative: visual haskell
08:34:58 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: what invariants do you see in Show class? 
08:35:16 <Philippa> that is, about picking which instance you want automatically
08:35:42 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: that it produces something Read will accept (if available). That it produces valid haskell code. That it is well-defined w.r.t Eq instance if present.
08:36:45 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: if you're not careful, "removing" that boilerplate turns local instances into dynamic scope. And dynamic scope is something I quite strongly dislike.
08:37:14 <quicksilver> you can of course use implicit parameters, which happen to contain dictionaries, to do this in GHC.
08:37:39 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: none of those can be enforced. show is awesome because you can print things. all those ocaml guys envy us, because they have parametric polymorphism, functors, objects and still can't print things
08:38:06 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: it's interesting, yesterday I've started with dynamic scope -> implicit arguments -> Oleg's paper
08:38:49 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: I'm not sure what point you're making by "none of those can be enforced".
08:38:55 <quicksilver> those are the invariants of the show class.
08:39:08 <quicksilver> they're not enforced any more than the Monad laws, but they are still important.
08:39:13 <jmcarthur> it's conventional for burden of proof to be placed on the implementor of a type class instance
08:39:27 <quicksilver> you can write an Ord instance which breaks Data.Map
08:40:02 * hemanth is liking http://tryhaskell.org/? :)
08:40:03 <quicksilver> there are plenty of invariants our type system fails to enforce.
08:40:44 <Paczesiowa> and we need no invariants to print things:)
08:40:46 <aristid> hemanth: why do you ask? sure, you like it! no need to ask whether we allow you to like it :D
08:40:47 <applicative> hemanth, indeed, what's not to like?  
08:41:16 <aristid> i love these try* sites that are springing up around the internetz
08:41:28 <hemanth> aristid, ha ha, its my like tryruby thinge :) 
08:41:36 <hemanth> applicative, :)
08:41:38 * applicative is looking for try c++
08:41:54 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: the purpose of the Show instance is to produce valid haskell code which can be copy-pasted into ghci, or your code, e.g. for a test case.
08:42:09 <monochrom> tryjavacatchHeadExplodeException
08:42:16 <quicksilver> Paczesiowa: if you use it for anything else, that's not really what it's for. Although feel free to do what you want.
08:42:18 <hemanth> was trying some xmpp stuff, me very new to haskel
08:43:16 <aristid> applicative: http://codepad.org allows you to try c++ :)
08:43:22 <joe_fishfish> so erm i guess tryhaskell went down
08:43:33 <jmcarthur> err
08:43:35 <Lycurgus> lol the itunes service agreement is 45 pages on the iphone
08:43:40 <djahandarie> joe_fishfish, it's up for me
08:43:45 <joe_fishfish> hmm yeah, seems fine
08:43:46 <Crunch_> same here.
08:43:48 <Paczesiowa> quicksilver: so I've been misusing the basic type class for the whole time...
08:43:48 <aristid> Lycurgus: i'm sure everybody reads it.
08:44:00 <joe_fishfish> just saw the huge mass quit and thought they were all from the site...
08:44:02 <joe_fishfish> guess not
08:44:09 <jmcarthur> i suspect that was just something funky from the freenode web client
08:44:22 <Lycurgus> aristid to show 45 pages is as much as to say "don't read this"
08:44:37 <applicative> joe_fishfish it happens often, like weather or something, suddenly 40 quits and joins
08:44:49 <joe_fishfish> well today has been an education, instead of doing any real work i rewrote some of my django app in haskell / snap
08:44:58 <quicksilver> joe_fishfish: how did it go?
08:45:03 <joe_fishfish> i think i got as far as 'snap init' :P
08:45:11 <Crunch_> snap.
08:45:11 <quicksilver> ;)
08:45:18 <joe_fishfish> been years since i looked at any haskell
08:45:20 <aristid> chrisdone: you recommend codepad.org on tryhaskell, but that uses an old version of Hugs... on the other hand i'm not sure if there's a significantly better alternative
08:46:00 <joe_fishfish> so snap is pretty big on monads and i don't think my uni classes covered monads
08:46:37 <aristid> joe_fishfish: maybe you want to read Real World Haskell as a refresher?
08:47:07 <djahandarie> A lot of applications use monads to help make their types safer (and thus their application safer also)
08:47:16 <joe_fishfish> isn't that pretty intense for a newbie though?
08:47:21 <applicative> hmmmm, lots of recent haskell on codepad, but people don't see they have to define "main"
08:47:36 <aristid> joe_fishfish: uh there's also learn you a haskell which is lighter
08:47:36 <asefasdf> ERLANG AGAIN
08:47:39 <aristid> @where lyah
08:47:39 <lambdabot> http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/
08:47:44 <aristid> @where rwh
08:47:44 <lambdabot> http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
08:47:53 <monochrom> you can add water to dilute it if you find it intense
08:47:58 <joe_fishfish> hehe
08:48:07 <applicative> http://learnyousomeerlang.com/
08:48:09 <monochrom> or I mean read more slowly
08:48:30 <djahandarie> joe_fishfish, rwh is pretty nice, it doesn't expect much knowledge from the reader
08:48:48 <joe_fishfish> ok, i'l take a look tomorrow
08:49:01 <joe_fishfish> maybe actually understand what writeBS actually does :P
08:49:18 <Tomsik__> writeBS?
08:49:21 <Tomsik__> :t writeBS
08:49:22 <lambdabot> Not in scope: `writeBS'
08:49:24 <Tomsik__> :(
08:49:30 <joe_fishfish> it's from Snap
08:49:37 <applicative> its a Snap definition
08:49:42 <joe_fishfish> foo :: Snap ()
08:49:42 <joe_fishfish> foo = do
08:49:43 <joe_fishfish>     writeBS "foo"
08:49:43 <joe_fishfish>     writeBS "bar"
08:49:43 <joe_fishfish>     writeBS "baz"
08:49:45 <joe_fishfish> etc
08:49:51 <aristid> joe_fishfish: lyah and rws do not cover snap
08:49:59 <aristid> -rws+rwh
08:50:29 <djahandarie> Don't paste too many lines in here btw
08:50:30 <conal> Hi all.  Here's a new blog post: http://conal.net/blog/posts/memoizing-higher-order-functions/
08:50:37 <djahandarie> Neat
08:50:39 <dons> very nice conal.
08:50:40 <lambdabot> dons: You have 1 new message. '/msg lambdabot @messages' to read it.
08:50:52 <joe_fishfish> i think once i have a general grounding in haskell concepts like monads the snap doc shouldn't be too scary
08:50:55 <conal> :)
08:51:21 <monochrom> your blog is #haskelled :)
08:51:32 <djahandarie> Seems like your images aren't loading
08:51:33 <applicative> joe_fishfish, the documentation says, writeBS "Adds the output from the given enumerator to the 'Response'"
08:51:49 <jmcarthur> conal: your blog is... dying!
08:51:55 <jmcarthur> yay it loaded finally
08:51:57 <joe_fishfish> applicative: oh yeah i got that bit, i just didn't get *how*
08:52:02 <jmcarthur> oh, except for images
08:52:06 <conal> hm.
08:52:19 <monochrom> ooooh, I like it imageless! :)
08:52:39 <Lockes> I'm 12 years old what is this?
08:52:49 <jmcarthur> heh
08:53:08 * jmcarthur spams conal's blog with refreshes
08:53:08 <applicative> Lockes, it's about the programming language Haskell. Very suitable for clever 12 year olds I have found. 
08:54:12 <aristid> applicative: how did you find that?
08:54:27 <applicative> aristid, what?
08:54:33 <Lockes> reddit
08:54:41 <aristid> applicative: that haskell is _very suitable_ for clever 12 year olds
08:54:57 <monochrom> by believing Cales
08:54:58 <aristid> applicative: i don't want to dispute it, i just want to know how you found it to be true
08:55:03 <OperaUser> Hi guys
08:55:13 <burp> don't let your mind get dirty by imperative programming ;)
08:55:17 <Lockes> is this easier than python?
08:55:21 <monochrom> yes
08:55:22 <applicative> Oh, just tried it a couple of times on suitable occasions... I will make progress with one of them, not too far yet.  Why would you doubt it?
08:55:23 <OperaUser> <--- The support is kinda shaky
08:55:53 <applicative> Elementary Haskell is incredibly easy, you just have to understand things like x + y
08:55:53 <Lockes> how easier?
08:56:42 <djahandarie> chrisdone, ^^
08:56:46 <aristid> applicative: uh dunno, it took me more than one run to learn haskell but i'm no 12 year old so maybe that's different... i simply don't know
08:56:46 <applicative> Lockes just try Try Haskell, I think you won't have a problem.
08:56:52 <OperaUser_> Why do I get an extra 8 or 9 when I write [ or ]?
08:56:56 <conal> jmcarthur: is my blog working for you now?
08:57:03 <OperaUser_> Like so: 8[ or 9]
08:57:40 <applicative> aristid, i'm not explaining fmap or something.  
08:57:58 <chrisdone> so one pattern I'm seeing a lot is people typing function names and hitting enter
08:58:06 <chrisdone> they'll be getting a Show instance error
08:58:11 <chrisdone> I should define an instance for a -> b
08:58:17 <aristid> applicative: you have to if you want to use Caleskell :D
08:58:21 <djahandarie> That'd be good
08:58:31 <djahandarie> chrisdone, there is an easy-to-replicate error in ie8
08:58:39 <aristid> chrisdone: uh, yes, i almost wanted to suggest that when i tried it 5 minutes ago
08:58:53 <djahandarie> Make any error happen and the input gets very weird
08:58:58 <applicative> aristid, infinite lists are all over the place though.  It was because he said something implicitly involving recursion that I knew he was ripe...
08:59:58 <Phyx-> djahandarie: yeah, already notified him about that
09:00:10 <djahandarie> Okay
09:00:11 <Phyx-> chrisdone: try disabling blur for a moment and i can test if that's it
09:00:35 <aristid> applicative: i'm trying to imagine what would be, if i had started with haskell instead of C
09:00:49 <aristid> (that rhymes :D)
09:00:52 <Guest58440> they're very different
09:00:57 <Guest58440> try C first
09:00:59 <jmcarthur> conal: well, i was able to read it, but the images still didn't show
09:01:03 <jmcarthur> i'm refreshing again now
09:01:05 <applicative> haskell is much easier to get into!
09:01:08 <Guest58440> then try C++
09:01:10 <jmcarthur> with even worse results
09:01:12 <aristid> Guest58440: uh that's ten years ago
09:01:14 <jmcarthur> CSS refuses to load again
09:01:14 <Lockes> can i try haskell on my linux laptop?
09:01:15 <Guest58440> then Objective C
09:01:28 <aristid> Lockes: in fact you can easily install haskell on your linux laptop
09:01:29 <applicative> Lockes, yeah, of course.  What distribution 
09:01:42 <conal> jmcarthur: hrmf.  thanks.
09:01:44 <daedra> err.. trypython.org requires silverlight
09:01:47 <Lockes> Ubuntu 10.4
09:01:49 <daedra> big mistake there
09:02:21 <aristid> Lockes: install the package ghc6
09:02:31 <conal> jmcarthur: the LaTeX formulas near the top aren't getting rendered for you?
09:02:33 <jystic> Hi all, i'm having some trouble connecting to MS SQL using HDBC, I seem to be having the same problem as this guy: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=24988  can anyone help?
09:02:37 <jmcarthur> conal: one or two are
09:03:02 <qwerty_0_o> hello?
09:03:06 <jmcarthur> conal: looks like they loaded for me this last time
09:03:12 <applicative> hi qwerty_0_o
09:03:17 <conal> jmcarthur: i was getting the same behavior earlier today.  thought it was just my crappy internet connection.
09:03:17 <jmcarthur> qwerty_0_o: hello
09:03:19 <qwerty_0_o> nice site
09:04:08 <qwerty_0_o> anyone else here a non-programmer?
09:04:15 * DrDuck raises hand
09:04:15 <Lockes> me
09:04:30 <Phyx-> o.O
09:04:39 <Phyx-> do.. you mean not by profession?
09:04:41 <Phyx-> or in general?
09:04:59 <qwerty_0_o> by progession
09:05:03 <qwerty_0_o> i'm actually in finance
09:05:08 <jmcarthur> i think a lot of non-programmers are finding their way here by reddit front page today :)
09:05:10 <qwerty_0_o> profession
09:05:10 * Phyx- raises hand
09:05:12 <jmcarthur> it can only be a good thing
09:05:17 <monochrom> "a programmer's regress"
09:05:20 <qwerty_0_o> yea reddit!
09:05:21 <Lockes> well if you are a programmer but you have another profession what is the point?
09:05:23 <Phyx-> i'm a student :)
09:05:26 <jmcarthur> qwerty_0_o: interesting, haskell is used in finance quite a bit :)
09:05:34 <burp> is this channel on reddit?
09:05:44 <ray> the day i call myself a programmer will be a shameful one indeed :D
09:05:44 <Phyx-> tryhaskell is
09:05:47 <burp> I see
09:05:54 <jmcarthur> burp: front page of reddit has a link to tryhaskell which now has a feature to join the irc channel on the page
09:05:58 <qwerty_0_o> it can be :)
09:06:48 <ray> i wonder if tryhaskell works on my phone
09:06:49 <qwerty_0_o> you in finance jmac
09:06:55 <qwerty_0_o> ?
09:07:11 <jmcarthur> qwerty_0_o: no, although i have considered it. is it a fun job at all?
09:07:31 <jmcarthur> qwerty_0_o: i currently do antitamper software
09:07:43 <qwerty_0_o> no it its not fun atall
09:07:52 <Phyx-> gawd, debugging is a pain in the *^#*# once your code reaches a certain  complexity :/
09:07:55 <qwerty_0_o> i work for a startup - more than 80 hours a week
09:07:58 <jmcarthur> ew
09:08:08 <qwerty_0_o> i work on saturdays
09:08:11 <monochrom> this is why I don't debug. I design.
09:08:21 <burp> startup they rip you off ;)
09:08:23 <applicative> burp, the thought is, if you have trouble understanding something, you can ask us about it
09:08:26 <qwerty_0_o> still, it is better than debugging
09:08:47 <Guest49065> c'mon, i don't fail
09:08:49 <Phyx-> monochrom: I just can't find the bug in this one, it's illogical
09:08:58 <applicative> jystic what is your own module like?
09:12:35 <DrDuck> Is the 'Learn You a Haskell' tutorial in hardback yet?
09:12:43 <DrDuck> tutorial/book*?
09:12:53 <djahandarie> Not yet, but I believe it's being worked on
09:12:55 <monochrom> No. Is it even on paper?
09:13:10 <djahandarie> monochrom, you can print it!
09:13:13 <monochrom> I guess it is.
09:13:16 <chrisdone> looking at the logs, (about 5 evals a second now), people are really having a go at it, trying different expressions, seeing how it's different to the languages they're used to, etc
09:13:16 <DrDuck> :\
09:13:24 <applicative> I printed it, once
09:13:33 <monochrom> you can put it on an ipad. then it's hardback. :)
09:13:35 <DrDuck> Haskell seems fun so far.
09:13:54 <Guest58440> it's a command line
09:13:55 <DrDuck> Feels like Python.
09:14:01 <quicksilver> chrisdone: mueval actuall invokes a fresh GHC each time to compile, right?
09:14:07 <djahandarie> DrDuck, Real World Haskell (another book) is published by O'Reilly
09:14:12 <quicksilver> chrisdone: that's quite substantial work for each tiny expression.
09:14:18 <quicksilver> w/in 25
09:14:32 <chrisdone> quicksilver: tryhaskell's mueval is persistent, it keeps the GHC API interpreter running
09:14:36 <monochrom> chrisdone is on the way of becoming another google, analysing user input comprehensively and inventing new solutions :)
09:14:48 <quicksilver> chrisdone: oh, so it's bytecode. 
09:14:50 <chrisdone> monochrom: haha
09:15:01 <DrDuck> djahandarie: Thanks.
09:15:01 <jystic> applicative: http://gist.github.com/484695
09:15:03 <quicksilver> chrisdone: do have a few concurrent copies handling the inbound stuff?
09:15:06 <quicksilver> chrisdone: (fastcgi?)
09:15:12 <chrisdone> quicksilver: that's right. four concurrent ones
09:15:21 <chrisdone> (fastcgi)
09:15:37 <quicksilver> The fastcgi protocol permits one application backend to service multiple concurrent requests
09:15:45 <quicksilver> but I've never seen anyone actually *use* it
09:15:50 <quicksilver> does the haskell fastcgi interface permit that?
09:15:55 <quicksilver> (haskell would be a great language for it)
09:15:58 <chrisdone> quicksilver: yeah, i didn't write it multi-threaded (yet)
09:16:12 <Saizan> quicksilver: i'm pretty sure it does
09:16:13 <chrisdone> it's actually written using mvars, so making it multi-threaded is easy
09:16:15 <quicksilver> Saizan: nice.
09:16:35 <quicksilver> chrisdone: yes, and immutable-by-default makes it so much easier.
09:16:36 <DrDuck> Is Haskell ever used out there by "real world" companies, or is it just a language used at prestigious universities (i.e. Scheme)?
09:16:47 <djahandarie> chrisdone, your mueval fork seems neater than the normal one
09:17:01 <Zao> DrDuck: Some companies use it quite successfully.
09:17:08 <Zao> DrDuck: I belive there's a short list on the site somewhere.
09:17:11 <quicksilver> chrisdone: the perl/fastcgi backends out there that I'm aware of don't do the multiple requests at once thing, but then again that would be madness with perl's "loads of mutable global state" model.
09:17:12 <Zao> Galois, etc.
09:17:15 <DrDuck> Sweet.

09:17:26 <Christ_> Haskell is a general purpose programming language, like many of the other ones that you're used to. However, Haskell has a really interesting take on the world: in the words of those of us who talk a lot about languages and their differences, Haskell is statically typed, as well as purely functional.  What all of these things mean in total is that Haskell is unlike any other programming language you've (probably) used, and wrapping

09:17:38 <Phyx-> DrDuck: look at that link
09:18:06 <Phyx-> and i've obviously used hoogle waaaaay to much
09:18:11 <chris_____> hi im chris
09:18:21 <Phyx-> hi chris_____ 
09:18:50 <chris_____> hi phyx-, how goes it matey? :-)
09:19:05 <Christ_> ALGO ҉ ̵IS̡̢̢̛THE̛̛̖̗̘̙̜̝̞̟̠̖̗̘̙̜̝̞̟ ̠̊̋̌̍̎̏̐̑̒̓ ̌̍̎̏̐̑̒̓̔̊̋̌̕̚̕ ̍̎̏̐̑̒̓̔̿̿̿̕̚̕̚ ͡ ͡҉҉ ̓̔̿̿̿̕̚۩￼◊} OH GOD ҉̵̞̟̠̖̗̘̙̜̝ ̞̟̠͇̊̋̌̍̎̏̐̑̒̓̔ ̊̋̌̍̎̏̐̑̒̓̔̿̿̿̕ ̚̕̚͡ ͡҉ 
09:19:13 <Phyx-> oh my god...
09:19:45 * Phyx- reaaaaaaaally need to get unicode support in his irssi
09:19:49 <applicative> jystic, and you're getting the same "index too large" error
09:19:55 <jystic> yeah
09:19:59 <Phyx-> chris_____: it goes fine, and you?
09:20:06 <Zao> I'm quite happy that that ALGO failed horribly.
09:20:12 <jystic> i've tried it on ubuntu and windows with different odbc drivers
09:20:27 <jystic> the database has a large number of tables
09:20:42 <chrisdone> quicksilver: it's really not enough load to break a sweat. the only reason i have four processes is because lighttpd seems to do its own load balancing and would stop the fastcgi process completely if it thought the load was too high. if i enable it to use four, it doesn't exhibit this strange behaviour. i haven't exactly ran ab on it, though
09:20:46 <p_l> Algo?
09:20:53 <jystic> i can successfully query it, but i just can't get a list of the tables, which means i can't generate anything for haskelldb
09:21:00 * p_l recalls a horribly crippled Pascal implementation by that name
09:21:15 <Zao> p_l: "zalgo" is a horrible abuse of stacking diacritics in text.
09:21:38 <p_l> ah
09:21:39 <Zao> p_l: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo
09:21:47 <Zao> See the Example Usage bits.
09:21:56 <p_l> yes, now I recognize, it's just that someone dropped the 'Z' 
09:22:02 <p_l> and I had flashbacks
09:22:13 <Zao> Images may be unsafe for work, didn't notice them at first.
09:22:42 <quicksilver> chrisdone: nod
09:22:49 <quicksilver> chrisdone: is it a real colo or a virtual server?
09:22:59 <chrisdone> quicksilver: virtual server on linode
09:23:04 * quicksilver nods
09:23:27 <chrisdone> quicksilver: http://i.imgur.com/Auc6g.png
09:23:53 <quicksilver> chrisdone: I saw earlier.
09:24:12 <quicksilver> chrisdone: that strikes me as substantial bandwidth. I wonder when you start paying for bandwidtg?
09:24:39 <int80_h> good day everyone
09:24:51 <int80_h> ski : hello :)
09:24:55 <chrisdone> quicksilver: I'm paying for 200GB a month. if I go over that, IIRC, it charges the next increment
09:25:48 <chrisdone> "You have used 1% of your monthly transfer."
09:26:05 <quicksilver> chrisdone: You're fine then. That's not a bad allowance.
09:26:18 <quicksilver> chrisdone: I'd be surprised if tryhaskell makes more than 2G/day for you.
09:26:54 <chrisdone> quicksilver: indeed
09:27:05 <monochrom> haha
09:27:21 * fryguybob read 2G as $2,000
09:27:30 <djahandarie> Haha
09:27:38 <djahandarie> Raking in the cash with all the ads
09:27:42 <quicksilver> surely as a monetary term it would be $2000000000?
09:27:45 * Phyx- thinks it's time to add a IGNORE on #Haskell for JOIN PART and QUIT
09:28:05 <djahandarie> Phyx-, I just dim them down, they are hardly noticible
09:28:29 <Phyx-> dim them down?
09:28:33 <quicksilver> the vertical space they take up in the window is annoying.
09:28:45 <Phyx-> you have a dial?
09:28:53 <quicksilver> I wish it was possibile to hide them but have them available to display if you want to see them.
09:28:58 <djahandarie> That's true, but I generally like them having them on unless it makes the channel totally impossible
09:28:59 <Phyx-> quicksilver: not to mention make my window scroll :P
09:29:07 <quicksilver> Phyx-: well, that's what I mean by vertical space
09:29:18 <Phyx-> lol
09:29:56 <Phyx-> does irssi have some sort of excempt things?
09:30:07 <tryhaskell> \j #clojure
09:30:08 <Phyx-> like ignore all part,join and quit except from xxx?
09:30:58 <Zao> Phyx-: /ignore JOINS PARTS CRAP  would ignore all that in a channel.
09:31:05 <Zao> Oh, QUITS.
09:31:28 <dcoutts> chrisdone: nice work on tryhaskell 
09:31:29 <Zao> Works per nick too.
09:31:42 <djahandarie> http://althack.org/irssi.png is how I run mine
09:31:42 <Zao> dcoutts: He kind of failed at the avoid success bit.
09:31:45 <Phyx-> Zao: yeah i know, I was looking for a way to ignore those from everyone except those i stalk :P
09:31:48 <dcoutts> chrisdone: I presume you've seen the reddit thread on it, some users there are reporting problem with opera
09:31:52 <dcoutts> Zao: heh :-)
09:32:03 <Zao> Phyx-: There might be some script for that.
09:32:17 <zygoloid> only up to 669 people here though. that's not a record yet iirc
09:32:29 <dcoutts> chrisdone: opera users reporting characters like + get entered twice, and the error message box comes up blank (rather than message + ok button)
09:37:14 <arcatan> i gather there is an integrated chat in tryhaskell, but why can't i see it?
09:37:32 <Phyx-> arcatan: type chat
09:37:49 <arcatan> oooh
09:38:15 <int80_h> chat
09:38:32 <Phyx-> int80_h: in tryhaskell ofcourse
09:38:33 <Phyx-> lol
09:39:01 <quicksilver> arcatan: I believe it mentions it at some point in the tutorial but not right at the beginning.
09:39:01 <djahandarie> arcatan, it shows up as a prompt after doing a few steps in the tutorial
09:39:03 <Axman6> but how are we supposed to chat about #haskell?
09:39:04 <applicative> dcoutts chrisdone, yes, I see in opera, if I make an error, theres a blank box, and it freezes hopelessly. 
09:39:18 <quicksilver> arcatan: increases the chance that people are actually interested by the teim they get there.
09:39:58 <arcatan> quicksilver: yeah, sounds like a good idea
09:40:18 <jystic> applicative: i managed to fix it by installing the latest source from http://github.com/jgoerzen/hdbc-odbc
09:40:27 <Phyx-> applicative: IE does it too, I suspect it's the blur the box tries to execute
09:40:44 <arcatan> i clicked through a few steps in the tutorial, but missed the chat ad apparently
09:41:04 <applicative> jystic, awesome, I was at a loss to find where (!!) was being called.  
09:41:52 <applicative> if I type chat in opera, i get the freenode link... but since chat is an error, i get that blank and so on
09:42:32 <applicative> Phyx-, what's blur dare I ask
09:42:38 <OperaUser_> It works for me in Opera
09:42:43 <OperaUser_> The chat that is
09:43:06 <Phyx-> applicative: after you make an error, a box comes up, when you press ok, it blurs/fades in the background
09:43:24 <OperaUser_> But the most annoying issue is the dubbel characters if you type a [ or ]
09:43:35 <c_wraith> huh.  Moving NFData out of parallel is breaking a bunch of packages.
09:44:04 <applicative> Phyx-, yes i see elsewhere.  
09:44:23 <c_wraith> ... specifically, packages that don't set an upper bound on their dependencies
09:44:48 <dafis> c_wraith: it's been moved to deepseq half a year ago, there are still packages breaking?
09:45:03 <applicative> OperaUser_, that is bad, I hope the "[" problem isn't in IE too...
09:45:08 <c_wraith> dafis: hexpat
09:45:24 <dafis> c_wraith: but if they don't specify upper bounds, they deserve it :)
09:46:00 <OperaUser_> Scratch that, the gray box that covers everything is more annoying hehe
09:46:03 <c_wraith> dafis: also, it was only actually *removed* from parallel with version 3.0.0.0, which was released yesterday
09:46:07 <OperaUser_> How can I remove it?
09:47:02 <chrisdone> dcoutts: thanks. yes, I'm aware of opera. it's a lot of work to get right especially with different keyboard layouts. it doesn't behave the same way firefox, webkit and IE8 do. opera's notorious for its handling of key presses. maybe i'll have another go at sorting it if i have time (for my particular instance of opera) but it's not very rewarding work :-)
09:47:42 <c_wraith> Opera behaves so differently from every other browser for any non-trivial javascript app that it's *really* hard to justify supporting.
09:47:43 <OperaUser_> chrisdone: If it's to much work, forget about it. Focus the time you have on the grey box issue instead
09:47:46 <chrisdone> OperaUser_: i'll remove that for opera users
09:47:55 <OperaUser_> Thank you! :)
09:50:18 <dcoutts> chrisdone: aye, just complaints from some users, but there's lots of others saying "yay" :-)
09:54:13 <Phyx-> lol, IE9 doesn't exibit the bug IE8 has on it
09:54:38 <zygoloid> chrisdone: i got a hang in lesson 4 step 18. :( can i provide you with any useful debug?
09:56:07 <chrisdone> okay, the opera grey box is fixed
09:57:01 <chrisdone> zygoloid: sure. go to #tryhaskell
09:57:01 * Lycurgus pushes back on ie9.
09:57:04 <dcoutts> chrisdone: that was quick!
09:57:21 <Phyx-> Lycurgus: ?
09:57:26 <Lycurgus> my it never have a greater share than ie6
09:57:32 <Lycurgus> *may
09:57:52 * Phyx- shrugs
09:58:12 <chrisdone> going home now, bbs
10:00:02 <int80_h> I have a function that needs an expression at the end of a do contruction. I'm building it and need something to hold the place of what will eventually go there. Any suggestions?
10:00:22 <Phyx-> return undefined?
10:00:27 <quicksilver> undefined matches any type int80_h 
10:00:35 <Phyx-> or rather undefined would work too :P
10:00:39 <quicksilver> so does (error "I haven't written this bit yet")
10:00:48 <quicksilver> which gives a useful error if you try to execute it ;)
10:01:05 <int80_h> thanks :)
10:01:05 <Phyx-> what, you don't find "error: Prelude.undefined" useful?
10:01:12 <mreh> is mdo deprecated?
10:01:42 <aristid> mreh: why would it be? oO
10:01:48 <zygoloid> mreh: yeah, use do rec instead.
10:01:54 <aristid> oh
10:01:55 <mreh> i thought we use rec
10:01:58 <mreh> :)
10:02:02 <Phyx-> haskell has rec?
10:02:05 <zygoloid> -XDoRec instead of -XRecursiveDo
10:02:15 <zygoloid> Phyx-: GHC has rec. for do and proc notation.
10:02:25 <mreh> it's borrowed from arrow notation
10:02:26 <Saizan> let is rec by default :)
10:02:41 <aristid> zygoloid: what's the advantage over mdo?
10:03:04 <zygoloid> aristid: it's not deprecated ;-)
10:03:11 <Tzarly> Hi, I got sucked into the try-haskell page off reddit. Does anyone have any cool links which go to webpages that detail the differences between Haskell and Lisp?
10:03:41 <aristid> zygoloid: why was do rec introduced?
10:03:41 <quicksilver> well, Tzarly, the key difference is the type system.
10:04:02 <quicksilver> I can't think of a webpage with exactly that focus.
10:04:10 <quicksilver> aristid: infelicities in the implementation of mdo.
10:04:15 <Phyx-> zygoloid: mkay
10:04:18 <Tzarly> I'll google it...
10:04:25 <quicksilver> aristid: turns out that in some monads it makes a big difference how much of the action you trap inside the 'mfix'
10:04:36 <Phyx-> Saizan: which is why i'm confused
10:04:42 <quicksilver> aristid: ... and that means some harmless looking code changes have surprising effect.
10:04:55 <quicksilver> aristid: the RecDo is supposed to make it more obvious how much is mfix'ed.
10:05:09 <Tzarly> This is not a new topic
10:05:33 <int80_h> I have a function fooFunction :: IO [Entry]. I compile it in ghci but when I try to invoke it "fooFunction" I get a not in scop error. How do I invoke it corectly?
10:06:02 <quicksilver> that sounds fine to me int80_h. Typo?
10:06:42 <mreh> doesn't compiling it with ghc first break that?
10:08:14 <aristid> quicksilver: i see.
10:09:00 <quicksilver> aristid: do you? I don't, really. But I read that somewhere and believe it ;)
10:09:27 <aristid> quicksilver: *shrug* "I see" can mean many things
10:09:55 <chats> Oo0o0o0o0o0o0
10:09:59 <aristid> quicksilver: in this case, i understand it on the basic level of "mfix is dangerous, and do rec is more explicit about what is in mfix"
10:10:08 <ezyang> Bah I don't understand Conal's post. 
10:10:43 <aristid> ezyang: well you need a PhD to do memoisation in haskell, it is well known.
10:10:56 <ezyang> Not true! 
10:11:06 <aristid> lol
10:11:44 <applicative> I have a PhD, but I can't memoize
10:12:04 <aristid> the memo combinators library seemed quite understandable to me
10:12:09 <aristid> have you looked at that?
10:12:13 <jystic> hi all, is there a way that i can disable warnings as errors for a single file?
10:14:19 <jmcarthur> ezyang: have you read the prerequisite posts?
10:14:26 <jmcarthur> there are a few now

10:15:52 <ezyang> jmcarthur: Not yet. 
10:16:04 <ezyang> so I guess that should go on my reading list. 
10:16:10 <Phyx-> :t join (&&&)
10:16:11 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) b c. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a b (c, c)
10:16:24 <jmcarthur> it's a Jake__ !
10:16:28 <int80_h> I'd like to discuss the following "getDirectoryContents "/" >>= return . filter (`notElem` [".", ".."])
10:16:28 <Phyx-> :t join (&&&) (1,2)
10:16:29 <lambdabot>     No instance for (Arrow (,))
10:16:29 <lambdabot>       arising from a use of `&&&' at <interactive>:1:5-9
10:16:29 <lambdabot>     Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Arrow (,))
10:16:38 <jake__> hello haskellers!
10:16:42 <jmcarthur> Jake__: always nice to see people with good names
10:16:42 <Phyx-> :t join (&&&) 2
10:16:43 <lambdabot> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) b c. (Arrow a, Num (a b c)) => a b (c, c)
10:16:52 <jake__> it's a jmcarthur!
10:16:53 <int80_h> return puts the output of filter into an IO action right?
10:16:57 <applicative> jystic, http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/using-ghc.html#source-file-options
10:16:58 <Phyx-> yeah... that's not gonna work...
10:17:03 <jake__> yeah, i try my best
10:17:31 <djahandarie> @unpl return . filter (`notElem` [".", ".."])
10:17:32 <lambdabot> (\ d -> return (filter (\ a -> notElem a ([".", ".."])) d))

10:18:02 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *). (Monad m) => [[Char]] -> m [[Char]]
10:18:35 <Phyx-> int80_h: yes
10:19:00 <int80_h> Phyx and what does >>= do then?
10:19:01 <applicative> jystic, so write {-#OPTIONS_GHC -W #-} at the head of the file
10:19:09 <Phyx-> though a >>= return (f a) == fmap f a
10:19:16 <jystic> applicative: yep was just finding that part, thanks!
10:19:18 <djahandarie> :t >>=
10:19:19 <lambdabot> parse error on input `>>='
10:19:22 <djahandarie> :t (>>=)
10:19:24 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a b. (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
10:19:58 <int80_h> I'm having difficulty understanding the notation
10:20:06 <Phyx-> int80_h: (a >>= b) evaluated a and passes the resulting value as in input to b
10:20:13 <int80_h> what does the forall section say?
10:20:23 <djahandarie> "I'll let you do something with the thing (a) in the box (m) as long as it ends up in the box (m) again"
10:20:26 <djahandarie> Ignore the forall
10:20:28 <Phyx-> forget about the forall for now
10:20:32 <int80_h> oh okay.
10:20:35 <applicative> ignore forall
10:20:42 <Phyx-> and the m :: * -> *
10:20:44 <burp> it's like the "forall" in math, right?
10:21:12 <int80_h> yeah it translates to "for every" but then I can't go further than that
10:23:45 <ezyang> int80_h: For all monads, the following function exists. 
10:24:09 <ezyang> The m :: * -> * is made superfluous by the Monad m constraint, since monads must have kind * -> * 
10:31:46 <dolio> ezyang: I'm not sure I believe that this memoization of higher-order functions is likely to be a win.
10:31:49 <dolio> Possibly ever.
10:32:03 <ezyang> dolio: But but, it's pretty! (he says) 
10:32:48 <dolio> Actually, I guess it could be.
10:33:22 <dolio> But seems an odd way of accomplishing it.
10:33:52 <Wolfspaw> BONUS: Your tutorial is the best programming book (if you consider a book) i ever read! ; )
10:34:09 <int80_h> how can I examine the type of a local variable in ghci?
10:34:10 <dolio> The situation you need is that 'f :: (a -> b) -> c' would be faster if its argument were memoized, I think.
10:34:33 <dolio> But instead of memoizing the argument, you memoize f to turn it into a function that memoizes its argument.
10:35:43 <zygoloid> int80_h: you mean, like the type of a variable which exists only within a function?
10:35:55 <int80_h> zygoloid: yes
10:36:45 <zygoloid> int80_h: that's tricky. one evil trick might be to turn on implicit params and then use (x `asTypeOf` ?t) in place of x (your variable) somewhere
10:37:15 <int80_h> thanks :)
10:37:39 <int80_h> I'll use that if I have to, I just replicated the code in ghci which worked. My needs must be simple :)
10:38:02 <zygoloid> @type let f (a:as) = (x `asTypeOf` ?t) ++ f as where x = replicate a 0 in f
10:38:04 <lambdabot> forall t. (?t::[t], Num t) => [Int] -> [t]
10:38:05 <int80_h> it's about to get tricky. Type agreement seems to be what haskell is about
10:38:32 <hpc> :t asTypeOf
10:38:34 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> a -> a
10:38:43 <hpc> @src asTypeOf
10:38:44 <lambdabot> asTypeOf = const
10:39:03 <c_wraith> const with more constrained type signatures is actually a great trick.
10:39:15 <hpc> indeed
10:39:46 <Wolfspaw> .
10:42:06 <khaled>  this is cool
10:42:20 <Phyx-> does ghc report correct error messages in literate haskel files? I thought it called delit before processing the file
10:43:36 <zygoloid> Phyx-: you mean, correct line numbers? try it and see...
10:47:35 <int80_h> > :t <-
10:47:36 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `:'
10:47:45 <int80_h> > t <-
10:47:46 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
10:47:55 <int80_h> >:t <-
10:48:03 <int80_h> oh great
10:48:16 <Saizan> Phyx-: delit probably adds {-# LINE .. #-} pragmas or equivalent
10:48:21 <int80_h> how do I get lamdabot to give me the type of <-
10:48:29 <hpc> <- is a sugar symbol
10:48:36 <hpc> it can't be made a function
10:48:45 <int80_h> hmm
10:49:04 <int80_h> <- wraps a thing inside an IO action right?
10:49:19 <Saizan> int80_h: "do x <- foo; .." gets desugared to "foo >>= \x -> .."
10:49:32 <hpc> x <- foo; bar x desugars to foo >>= \x -> bar x
10:51:19 <ksoni> [42,13,22]
10:52:07 <zygoloid> i have ksoni's lottery numbers. how can i profit from this knowledge?
10:52:24 <Phyx-> Saizan: hmm, I'll call it myself and see what it gives
10:52:42 <Phyx-> zygoloid: lol, that's one way, but I would still need to know how it does it
10:57:42 <chrisdone> ciao
10:58:40 <djahandarie> yo
11:00:02 <zygoloid> Phyx-: ghc runs unlit with "-h filename". that causes unlit to add '#line 1 "filename"' to the start of the output
11:00:38 <zygoloid> Phyx-: other than that, as far as i can see it just converts comment lines to blank lines, changes the "> " to "  ", and thus preserves the line and column numbering.
11:00:42 <aristid> zygoloid: you can marginally increase your expected profit (actually, just decrease expected loss) by NOT using them, and using other numbers instead
11:01:12 <zygoloid> aristid: haha, nice idea :)
11:01:27 <Phyx-> zygoloid: ah, that's good, so i can use unlit to detect where haskell and non-haskell blocks are then
11:03:52 <aristid> zygoloid: unfortunately it's still stupid to execute on it :D
11:04:05 <djahandarie> It'd be nice to see more integration of hpc and cabal
11:04:19 <hpc> indeed; then i could interface with it directly
11:04:24 <hpc> no silly keyboard to get in my way
11:04:28 <hpc> ;)
11:04:49 <hpc> seriously though, that would be very nice
11:06:59 <zygoloid> aristid: depends how big the prize fund is.
11:07:15 <zygoloid> (and also if i'm allowed to buy one of each ticket)
11:09:52 <aristid> zygoloid: as long as the expected loss is close to -50%, i don't f*cking care about the size of the prize fund
11:11:45 <zygoloid> aristid: if the pre-existing prize fund is larger than half the cost to buy one of each ticket, and you know you'd be the only one who wins if you did, then you profit by doing so (assuming 50% of ticket sales go to the prize fund)
11:11:54 <mdogg> hey what's up
11:12:02 <Saizan> djahandarie: the current gsoc on cabal test might cover that, or you could otherwise suggest that it does :)
11:12:38 <zygoloid> with double-rollovers it's often economical to "buy" the lottery if you think the chance of someone else doing so is low.
11:12:43 <aristid> zygoloid: of course more people tend to buy tickets when the fund is large
11:13:08 <zygoloid> it also depends a lot on how risk-averse you are :)
11:13:22 <zygoloid> (and whether you have £14 million just lying around)
11:14:27 <OvenCookie> hello
11:14:43 <AIienreborn> Hey 
11:14:56 <OvenCookie> Hows it going
11:15:10 <juanchi> all is well
11:15:31 <Phyx-> Saizan: isn't it a bit late for changes? :P
11:15:34 <OvenCookie> Can any of you guys help with this haskell stuff?
11:15:48 <dafis> OvenCookie: many of us
11:16:00 <OvenCookie> :)
11:16:06 <Saizan> Phyx-: isn't there all of august still?:)
11:16:08 <dafis> OvenCookie: which Haskell stuff specifically?
11:16:35 <Phyx-> Saizan: oh, I thought it was almost over
11:16:38 <OvenCookie> Step 6, never heard of it till today. I'm learning C aswell :S
11:16:57 * Phyx- should of done gsoc
11:17:04 <Phyx-> the money would have come in handy
11:17:07 <OvenCookie> sorry worked it out
11:17:10 <OvenCookie> my bad
11:17:18 <dafis> OvenCookie: not all of us have completely memorised tryhaskell, what was step 6?
11:17:36 <OvenCookie> Sorry, anyway worked it out. 
11:17:43 <dafis> OvenCookie: cool :)
11:17:59 <OvenCookie> Mind if I pick your brains if I get stuck again?
11:18:08 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> Go ahead.
11:18:17 <dafis> OvenCookie: don't do it literally :)
11:18:45 <n00b_> how many people are here from reddit?
11:18:47 <OvenCookie> :P The zombie apocalypse is not quite here..
11:18:49 <OvenCookie> me
11:18:54 <djahandarie> Seemes like the gsoc cabal stuff is for giving cabal the ability to interface with any test/test-suite
11:19:10 <djahandarie> I can't entirely grasp what he's doing
11:19:50 <dafis> preflex: seen alexyk
11:19:51 <preflex>  alexyk was last seen on #haskell 6 days, 13 hours, 32 minutes and 41 seconds ago, saying: ezyang: real world is big
11:20:19 <djahandarie> lol
11:20:44 <djahandarie> Reminds me of that other quote... "Hilbert space is a big place!"
11:21:04 <djahandarie> Carlton Caves
11:21:11 <dafis> djahandarie: not in the university of Gttingen
11:21:13 <int80_h> Couldn't match expected type `[IO String]' against inferred type `IO (IO String)'
11:21:32 <Phyx-> indices.Zip(spans,(x,y)=>Tuple.Create(x,y)); <-- c#'s version just doesn't look that clean :/
11:21:43 <int80_h> can I use lift to lift (IO String) out of IO (IO String)?
11:21:46 <Zao> int80_h: You've got an action yielding an action that yields strings.
11:21:56 <Tomsik__> int80_h: join, not lift?
11:22:06 <Zao> int80_h: No, but you can use <- in a do block, or >>=, or some other sequencing.
11:22:07 <int80_h> ah join!
11:22:29 <int80_h> Zao: I am using <- here is the line
11:22:33 <Tomsik__> well, join has the right type, I have no idea what it does in terms of IO
11:22:46 <int80_h> entries <- map readFile entryFileName
11:22:55 <dafis> Tomsik__: join is (>>= id) in all monads
11:23:03 <djahandarie> dafis, I had to look up why that made any sense, but now I see. ;)
11:23:05 <Phyx-> :t mapM
11:23:12 <Phyx-> :t mapM
11:23:18 <dafis> int80_h: you probably want mapM
11:23:20 <Phyx-> botty?
11:23:26 <djahandarie> lol, lambdabot is GONE
11:23:27 <Phyx-> did they kill botty?
11:23:27 <hpc> dead
11:23:35 <zygoloid> (>>= f) is (join . fmap f) in all monads :)
11:23:46 <Phyx-> but yeah, int80_h you want mapM
11:23:50 <djahandarie> lambdabot should really just reconnect when it pings out
11:24:26 <int80_h> thanks guys, that compiled
11:24:35 <edges> o_o what exactly is this
11:24:49 <zygoloid> djahandarie: ghc should really just fix my type errors ;-)
11:25:08 <jmcarthur> edges: this is an irc channel where the topic is haskell
11:25:09 <Phyx-> zygoloid: ghc should really just read my mind
11:25:15 <int80_h> edges: I'm taking the blog example from the yesod web site, and trying to make it into a working blog
11:25:26 <jmcarthur> edges: or do you mean what is haskell?
11:25:31 <djahandarie> int80_h, he just joined the channel, he wasn't talking about you :P
11:25:37 <int80_h> ah
11:25:53 <edges> jmcarthur: I meant haskell but I read it up on reddit now.
11:26:01 <chat> im so confused
11:26:09 <Phyx-> why?
11:26:12 <edges> So is this now one big reddit tech party?
11:26:14 <jmcarthur> edges: well, feel free to ask questions here too :)
11:26:25 <Phyx-> edges: not really
11:26:28 <chat> yupp I saw it on reddit
11:26:31 <steveklabnik> )
11:26:33 <Trevion> edges: yes, but the party favors are lousy.
11:26:33 <steveklabnik> :)
11:26:38 <Phyx-> the majority of us didn't come here from reddit
11:26:39 <Saizan> edges: no, this is an irc channel about the programming language Haskell
11:26:44 <djahandarie> Welcome steveklabnik
11:26:48 <int80_h> I didn't come here from reddit
11:26:49 <jmcarthur> edges: we normally have around 650 users, so i guess we have 30-40 people from reddit today
11:26:49 <steveklabnik> thanks djahandarie 
11:26:54 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> Lots of people on right now that came from reddit (myself included) via 'TryHaskell'
11:27:03 <ki> what is this?
11:27:04 <jmcarthur> edges: actually, it might be closer to 600 that we normally have, i don't remember
11:27:08 <chrisdone> ybruglrdkrtumkhl: what do you make of Haskell then?
11:27:10 <steveklabnik> http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cryib/got_5_minutes_try_haskell_now_with_embedded_chat/ <- the thread, for anyone who's curious
11:27:21 <JohnDoe_> hi
11:27:22 <dafis> jmcarthur: 30-40 at each moment in time, probably several hundred over the day
11:27:24 <Red__> Anyone online?
11:27:27 <Red__> What's up.
11:27:28 <steveklabnik> I can't believe I noobed out in my explanation/
11:27:29 <jmcarthur> dafis: right
11:27:32 <Phyx-> ki: you got far enough in the tutorial to find chat but yet don't know what it is? :P
11:27:33 <int80_h> I blame lisp for getting me hooked on haskell. I started with lisp but eventually it didn't do it for me anymore. I needed to get my kicks some other way. Then I met this man who said the first monad was free...
11:27:33 <ki> seriously what is this
11:27:41 <ki> its kinda creepy
11:27:49 <Phyx-> what is?
11:27:51 <Red__> Anyone here from reddit?
11:27:55 <chat> here
11:27:55 <Kaz_> herro?
11:27:56 <ki> im probably talking to a bunch of rapist faggots
11:27:56 <jmcarthur> ki: haskell is a programming language. this is an irc channel with haskell as the topic :)
11:27:58 <chat> reddit
11:28:02 <chrisdone> ki: it's the chat room for the Haskell programming language
11:28:02 <ki> im from reddit
11:28:08 <Trevion> Oh, this is fantastic.
11:28:12 <Phyx-> ki: becareful :)
11:28:12 <chrisdone> keep it clean chaps
11:28:17 <chat> agreed
11:28:25 <Saizan> ki: please, moderate your language
11:28:33 <chrisdone> Trevion: getting anywhere with the tutorial?
11:28:36 <ki> stfu
11:28:40 <Jafet> Who pointed the chat link here?
11:28:44 <Phyx-> ki: you can get kicked out you know
11:28:46 <mietek> Axman6: I really like your system for identifying fruit.
11:28:48 <int80_h> I didn't do it!
11:28:48 <jmcarthur> ki: we are capable of banning you if necessary
11:28:57 <ki> do it
11:29:00 <ki> i dare u
11:29:02 <Kaz_> can't he just get back on?
11:29:03 <Trevion> chrisdone: I've been using Haskell for 7 years now... was just referring to the idea of linking the tutorial to #haskell
11:29:10 <JohnDoe_> tuple () list []
11:29:11 <Jafet> That was probably a bad decision when combined with the chosen marketing channels.
11:29:12 <jmcarthur> Kaz_: we can ban his ip
11:29:21 <djahandarie> Jafet, chrisdone did, I think it's a fine idea
11:29:24 * Phyx- thinks ki  is #Troll no# 1 , took long enough
11:29:24 <ki> woah forreal?
11:29:29 <jmcarthur> ki: you sure about that?
11:29:32 <Jafet> But if you market it to people like this...
11:29:34 <jmcarthur> yes forreal
11:29:37 <kmc> hmm, so Haskell just got popular?
11:29:42 <ki> haha thats cool
11:29:43 <chrisdone> Trevion: ahhh. sorry, i didn't recognise your nick :p
11:29:45 <kmc> i suppose we have failed
11:30:04 <ki> well you ppl are just lonely fags with no friends so bye
11:30:06 <Saizan> kmc: tryhaskell got a freenode webchat embedded into it and got to the front page of reddit
11:30:07 <zygoloid> steveklabnik: i enjoyed your comments on reddit, cheers :)
11:30:21 <kmc> Saizan, wow
11:30:25 <chrisdone> i like the idea of 600~ lonely people all in the same place :p
11:30:25 <djahandarie> Yeah
11:30:26 <steveklabnik> zygoloid: thank you. Did you catch the edit or two? I made a small amount of mistakes.
11:30:26 <djahandarie> lol
11:30:29 <int80_h> nah, the occasional douchebag on your channel is just the price for success.
11:30:35 <Trevion> chrisdone: Most people don't... and I would probably prefer that any who did, didn't. =)
11:30:43 <Phyx-> can someone ressurect lambdabot?
11:30:47 <djahandarie> Cale can
11:30:49 * djahandarie summons Cale
11:30:51 <Trevion> int80_h: I am interested in your definition of "occasional"
11:31:00 <aristid> preflex: seen Cale
11:31:00 <preflex>  Cale was last seen on #haskell 7 hours, 12 minutes and 35 seconds ago, saying: listofoptions: The orignal Perl 6 interpreter was written in Haskell but I don't know if it's being maintained now. I believe the plan is for Perl 6 to have a self-hosting compiler.
11:31:01 <kmc> int80_h, that's why we try to avoid success at all cost
11:31:03 <djahandarie> It's apparently on linode now though, I think it used to be on a yale server
11:31:08 <int80_h> trevion: I don't see that many trolls here.
11:31:12 <dodod> hello?
11:31:14 <djahandarie> Welcome
11:31:16 <aristid> HAHAHAHA perl 6
11:31:22 <dodod> whats up
11:31:26 <Phyx-> preflex: summon lamndabot
11:31:31 <int80_h> except today. fine.
11:31:35 <JohnDoe_> "i like the idea of 600~ lonely people all in the same place :p"  
11:31:37 <will_> what is this?
11:31:41 <aristid> apparently the haskell perl 6 compiler was a one man operation (one woman, after the gender change)
11:31:41 <dodod> whats the point of this?
11:31:45 <Kaz_> tuple tuple
11:31:51 <Phyx-> dodod: to teach you haskell
11:31:57 <jmcarthur> dodod: of haskell?
11:32:00 <will_> what is haskell
11:32:01 <djahandarie> The chat room is to help people learn
11:32:02 <int80_h> these guys kick ass at teaching haskell.
11:32:05 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> This is a chatroom for people interested in Haskell, a programming language.
11:32:06 <dodod> no whats the point of haskell
11:32:07 <zygoloid> steveklabnik: just read through the thread an hour or two ago. a few mistakes maybe, but nothing major i'd say.
11:32:11 <jmcarthur> will_: haskell is a programming language
11:32:13 <jmcarthur> dodod: ^^
11:32:15 <kmc> dodod, to write computar programs
11:32:24 <dodod> ok???
11:32:27 <aristid> it's also to discuss arcane details of haskell
11:32:27 <steveklabnik> zygoloid: the referential transparency one was pretty fundamental.
11:32:30 <djahandarie> Nice misspelling kmc
11:32:34 <kmc> thx
11:32:44 <dodod> so is it just to like talk to random ppl?
11:32:51 <kmc> dodod, about Haskell yes
11:32:54 <kmc> "what is haskell"
11:32:55 <j4cbo> did someone seriously tell the reddit crowd to get on irc and come *here*?
11:32:56 <j4cbo> wow
11:32:58 <kmc> haskell is a programming language
11:32:59 <aristid> no, these people are NOT random.
11:33:00 <jmcarthur> dodod: haskell is a programming language. this chat room's topic is haskell
11:33:08 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: what's the overall response been like today? I was at work before and I've only just got back. what's been the uninterested:interested ratio?
11:33:09 <aristid> it's a self-selected group with an interest in haskell
11:33:10 <jmcarthur> j4cbo: not quite so directly
11:33:15 <dodod> kick me off
11:33:18 <djahandarie> dodod, if you have any Haskell questions you can ask them and someone will help, that's the idea of the room
11:33:19 <int80_h> I thought only sequences could be random.
11:33:21 <chat> what can haskell be used for?
11:33:21 <kmc> i don't see where tryhaskell has a chat link
11:33:27 <kmc> chat, writing computer programs
11:33:27 <zygoloid> steveklabnik: when i read it it already said "EDIT: that's not true" which was good enough for me :)
11:33:27 <steveklabnik> j4cbo: it got mentioned once, in a small part of one thread.
11:33:28 <djahandarie> dodod, you can close the window I think
11:33:34 <int80_h> that's what Knuth says.
11:33:35 <hpc> kmc: type chat in the interpreter
11:33:35 <j4cbo> no wonder.
11:33:36 <dodod> no i cant
11:33:37 <Saizan> kmc: type chat at the prompt
11:33:38 <chrisdone> kmc: third step. you have to go through it a couple steps for it to tell you
11:33:43 <jmcarthur> oh dodod is ki
11:33:43 <Jafet> Bah. Relish your new "success".
11:33:49 <dodod> will something bad happen if u kick me?
11:34:02 <dodod> cause i wanna get kicked
11:34:05 <kmc> chrisdone, wow.  so this is already effort-filtered
11:34:09 <kmc> @where ops
11:34:11 <jmcarthur> dodod: your wish is my command
11:34:18 <dodod> thanks
11:34:20 <chrisdone> kmc: yeah, it's surprising
11:34:21 <kmc> ...did they kill lambdabot?
11:34:22 <FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU> lol
11:34:24 <chat> as an electrical engineering major, should i learn how to use this?
11:34:27 <djahandarie> kmc, no, it killed itself with a ping
11:34:33 <dodod> nothing happend
11:34:35 --- mode: ChanServ set +o jmcarthur
11:34:35 <kmc> chat, perhaps.  it'll make you a better programmer in every language
11:34:41 <Kaz_> all this code is running server-side, right?
11:34:42 <kmc> chat, if you don't care about programming at all, maybe not
11:34:47 <djahandarie> Kaz_, yes
11:34:48 <dodod> KICK ME
11:34:50 --- mode: jmcarthur set +b *!*@gateway/web/freenode/ip.68.39.229.135
11:34:52 <hpc> haskell has a HDL module
11:35:08 <kmc> chat, but if you think that programming sucks because it's full of boring trivialities like managing memory in C, Haskell might be a refreshing change
11:35:16 <djahandarie> Too slow!
11:35:31 --- mode: ChanServ set -o jmcarthur
11:35:37 <Phyx-> kmc: wouldn't any managed language be that? that's not the biggest selling point of haskell is it
11:35:39 <chrisdone> we knew a bunch of morons with nothing better to do would come in, but the hope is at least a few people will have really gained an interest, or spread the word
11:35:41 <Runar> Wait, why did it suddenly get loud in here?
11:35:42 <kmc> Phyx-, sure
11:35:58 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: regarding my message to you up there, what do you think?
11:36:08 <zygoloid> Runar: i guess we've hit Reddit PrimeTime?
11:36:09 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: it's mostly been pretty tame. lots of confused people
11:36:11 <Tzarly> Is there anyone present who's never used an imperative language at all. Ever? If so what do you think when see people using iterative and imperative languages as opposed to functional programming?
11:36:12 <kmc> Phyx-, but it's a relevant point for many EEs
11:36:22 <kmc> Tzarly, Haskell is an imperative language, so I doubt it
11:36:44 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: haskell is as imperative as you want it to be
11:36:45 <monochrom> looks like I missed some fun :)
11:36:47 <kmc> Tzarly, the world is not really divided into imperative and functional languages.  it's divided into imperative-style code and functional-style code, and most languages support both techniques
11:36:52 <Saizan> chrisdone: is there something more we can do to prevent the "what is this?" cases?
11:36:56 <Tzarly> my bad -> I thought it was functional. I'm currently on tryhaskell.org its cool
11:37:00 <kmc> Haskell supports both quite well
11:37:01 <dolio> monochrom: More to come, surely.
11:37:08 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> It's kind of odd calling Haskell an imperative language, even if you can do imperative programming in it. By that logic C is a functional language. (Not a bad one, actually.)
11:37:15 <kmc> ybruglrdkrtumkhl, it's hard to build closures in C
11:37:18 <Phyx-> Saizan: maybe show a box you have to click away with what haskell is when it loads?
11:37:22 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: haskell is purely functional but you can program imperatively with it
11:38:02 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: Saizan is right. we need a way to make it very very clear what haskell is and what this chat stuff is for
11:38:07 <chrisdone> Saizan: it's hard. the site clearly says "Haskell is a programming language etc.". you have to type a few expressions before being told about the chat. suggestions welcome
11:38:07 <Tzarly> I've recently found that with boost/lambda.hpp C++ can be made to take closures.
11:38:19 <hpc> changing the topic should be adequate
11:38:25 <kmc> Tzarly, specifically, in Haskell you write pure-functional programs that compute values of various types.  one type of value you can compute is "imperative program"
11:38:36 <Saizan> chrisdone: maybe someone posted a link to get directly to the chat somehow?
11:39:00 <zygoloid> wow, this is /still/ at the top of the programming subreddit
11:39:01 <jmcarthur> i think probably half of the "what is this?" questions are the beginnings of trolls
11:39:08 <aristid> ybruglrdkrtumkhl: the C preprocessor is a VERY bad functional language.
11:39:14 <jmcarthur> zygoloid: and on the front page
11:39:24 <Tzarly> aristid: agreed
11:39:25 <hpc> the C preprocessor isn't even turing complete, is it?
11:39:30 <zygoloid> jmcarthur: hah, #10 overall. impressive
11:39:34 <j4cbo> you can think about languages in terms of a lot of different spectral properties; one i like to think of is level of proof. one end you have purely "do this" code like C, C++, and asm, and on the other end of the spectrum you have languages like coq, twelf, and agda.
11:39:34 <aristid> hpc: it's not
11:39:46 <int80_h> Saizan: people don't read the information you give them. You can be as detailed as you like and you will still get people asking "what just happened?" , "What is this?"
11:39:49 <dolio> hpc: It is, sort of, I think.
11:39:53 <j4cbo> hpc: it is if you iterate it until reaching a fixed point
11:39:54 <Saizan> aristid: also, CPP macros are not interleaved with execution
11:39:54 <j4cbo> otherwise not.
11:40:11 <hpc> j4cbo: crazy
11:40:14 <aristid> hpc: but you can trick it into dealing with numbers as large as 256 (or more, theoretically)
11:40:23 <djahandarie> A main problem is that the reddit title says "chat" in it so people are probably clicking through just for that
11:40:34 <Saizan> int80_h: ok, let's require they type in by hand "I'm going to join a channel about the programming language haskell" or something :)
11:40:53 <jmcarthur> yeah, it may have been better if the headline had said something about getting help from real people instead of calling it chat
11:41:10 <Tzarly> Allow me a beginners question: What are (or will become) Haskell's mechanism for parallel computing. What sort of design patterns are taking favour amongst the Haskell community?
11:41:12 <int80_h> Saizan: they won't figure out how to do that.
11:41:16 <dolio> hpc: I think you can do recursion via #include.
11:41:37 <chrisdone> I like the idea of regular people reading "basics, syntax, functions, pattern matching and types!" and saying "oh, that chat sounds right up my alley"
11:41:40 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: haskell is the source of a lot of research in parallelism :)
11:41:48 <aristid> dolio: is that sufficient for turing completeness?
11:41:51 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: so naturally we have a lot of ways to do it
11:42:11 <hpc> aristid: recursion, function application, and name-binding
11:42:14 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: Saizan: can you think of a nice way to do it?
11:42:17 <hpc> that's a lambda calculus, i think
11:42:21 <j4cbo> "parallelism" as programming language researchers think of it tends to have little connection with how parallel systems actually work.
11:42:34 <dolio> aristid: Not necessarily. But I think I've seen suggestions that CPP gets there.
11:42:39 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: for pure parallel computation we have par, strategies, nested data parallelism... anything else guys?
11:42:43 <dolio> With examples of programs written in it.
11:42:51 <ANON_WAS> DILDO FAGGETS
11:42:52 <Jafet> dolio: no, because there is no scoping mechanism.
11:42:52 <Tzarly> par strategies?
11:42:53 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: and we also have concurrency abstractions which we tend to put under a different umbrella
11:42:55 <chrisdone> I suppose it'll fade off of the main page in an hour or two anyway, just being left at the top of /r/programming
11:43:10 --- mode: ChanServ set +o monochrom
11:43:10 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> jmcarthur: There's still system threads and mutexes if you want them
11:43:14 <jmcarthur> ANON_WAS: oh i'm sorry, i don't have my finger over the ban button right now
11:43:16 <Kaz_> mine froze =(
11:43:20 <Tzarly> I'm off to do some homework ciao for now...
11:43:21 <chrisdone> alternatively I could point it to #tryhaskell and the interested people could move here
11:43:24 <chrisdone> what do you think?
11:43:29 <ANON_WAS> Oh well Jm
11:43:31 --- mode: monochrom set +q *!*@gateway/web/freenode/ip.67.191.127.237
11:43:31 <jmcarthur> ybruglrdkrtumkhl: that would be the "concurrency" stuff i mentioned
11:43:31 <ANON_WAS> Sucks to be you
11:43:47 <dolio> Suggesting that CPP is a functional language doesn't make much sense, though.
11:44:12 <Jafet> It is a dysfunctional language.
11:44:18 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: i'm afraid of that scaring off people who are genuinely interested though
11:44:22 <shapr> C'mon, you can make functions in C++!
11:44:34 <perimosocordiae> in C you can even do function pointers
11:44:35 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: seeing all the immaturity around in #tryhaskell might discourage them from even bothering to come here
11:44:37 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: ehh i suppose the odd kickbanning makes a brief change, hehe
11:44:39 <dolio> shapr: C preprocessor.
11:44:41 <shapr> Good Afternoon #haskell!
11:44:44 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: sure, good point
11:44:48 <chrisdone> shapr: hii :)
11:44:49 <shapr> How's code treating everybody?
11:44:51 <djahandarie> Lo' shapr 
11:44:53 * shapr hugs chrisdone
11:44:56 * shapr hugs djahandarie
11:44:57 <chrisdone> ^_^
11:45:06 <djahandarie> Yeay I was almost left out of that
11:45:08 <snigacookie> hello, i just wanted to say hi and introduce myself
11:45:09 --- mode: monochrom set -o monochrom
11:45:17 <jmcarthur> perimosocordiae: function pointers are nowhere near the power of closures though :)
11:45:19 * AnAdorableNick ghcis shapr 
11:45:21 <chrisdone> snigacookie: hi there. getting anywhere in the tutorial?
11:45:22 <shapr> greetings snigacookie! Are you learning Haskell?
11:45:28 <int80_h> hi sharpr
11:45:42 <shapr> greetings int80_h!
11:45:45 <mart> ello
11:45:45 <int80_h> hi snigacookie
11:45:45 <burp> let's just bear the reddit crowd for a day ;-)
11:45:54 <perimosocordiae> jmcarthur: yeah, I learned that the hard way trying to implement lazy evaluation in C
11:46:01 <jmcarthur> heh
11:46:03 <Veinor> lazy evaluation... in c?
11:46:05 <Veinor> D:
11:46:08 <perimosocordiae> I got close
11:46:12 <snigacookie> im in the process of running through
11:46:12 <chrisdone> I implemented a lazy language in Haskell. it was easy :-P
11:46:14 <jmcarthur> Veinor: not so unheard of
11:46:25 <jmcarthur> Veinor: consider &&, ||, and ?:, for examples
11:46:25 <snigacookie> how did everyone else get notified about this?
11:46:33 <burp> actually it's cool to have the chat next to the tryhaskell box
11:46:40 <Veinor> is ?: short-circuiting?
11:46:41 <jmcarthur> snigacookie: most are probably coming from reddit
11:46:42 <chrisdone> snigacookie: 600 of us are regulars here, the rest are from reddit
11:46:43 <Tomsik__> you can simulate laziness in strict language by doing \_ -> 
11:46:47 <aristid> Veinor: in a way.
11:47:02 <aristid> Veinor: make that a Yes.
11:47:07 <jmcarthur> Veinor: well, it doesn't evaluate both the second and third arguments
11:47:09 <Tzarly> Even Haskell programs must run on Von Neuman architecture processors. They therefore must share the same restrictions of the other languages - You've only really gained a paradigm shift. Is it worth it?
11:47:10 <jmcarthur> only one of them
11:47:13 <int80_h> snigacookie : A man in black came to me and spoke words of lazy evaluation and a rigourous type system. I was lulled.
11:47:15 <Veinor> yeah, that's what I meant
11:47:20 <aristid> Tomsik__: but that's non-memoising laziness
11:47:27 <j4cbo> Tzarly: some people say so
11:47:28 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: yes! haskell is so much easier to work with
11:47:41 <dolio> Non-memoizing laziness isn't laziness. :)
11:47:44 <Veinor> I just tested it in perl and 'print "2" ? 7 : exit(0); print 7' prints 77
11:47:46 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: it's not about some sort of efficiency gain or anything. it's obvious that they all go down to binary anyway
11:47:53 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> Tzarly: It really depends on what you're trying to do, but for some things it is really nice.
11:47:54 <j4cbo> i actually disagree - laziness everywhere makes it really hard to reason about the time and memory usage of your program
11:47:58 <jmcarthur> dolio: true
11:48:03 <chrisdone> Tzarly: sure. if you're writing thousands of lines of code for your job or personal projects, you want to use a language that has properties that make your work easier
11:48:05 <j4cbo> which are some of the most important side effects it can have
11:48:19 <djahandarie> Does anyone know who ijk1 is?
11:48:24 <Veinor> causing your program to get OOM-killed is the ultimate side-effect :)
11:48:30 <chrisdone> a stool is alright for sitting on. haskell is a recliner
11:48:36 <Veinor> also, I love the phrase 'OOM-killed'
11:48:42 <jmcarthur> i don't really have these problems with laziness that others seem to have
11:48:49 <shapr> Me neither.
11:48:55 <j4cbo> but haskell is the only functional language with typeclasses, and that's a pretty big plus for it
11:49:00 <Tomsik__> yeah, laziness seems natural to me
11:49:15 <zygoloid> Tzarly: when the Vonn Neumannity pokes through, it can be harder to deal with, but mostly it's fine
11:49:20 <Tzarly> It's been said that a language like Haskell grows logarithmically in size  as your project and program grows in complexity and size - What have your experiences shown you with regard to this?
11:49:23 <Veinor> just throw `seq` at it until it goes away ;)
11:49:27 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> Laziness and strictness are just tools, useful for certain situations and dangerous when used in others.
11:49:46 <chrisdone> how does a language grow logarithmically?
11:49:50 <perimosocordiae> LOC?
11:49:55 <j4cbo> ybruglrdkrtumkhl: yup.
11:49:57 <int80_h> with bad magic?
11:50:00 <Tzarly> sorry I mean the codebase
11:50:04 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: i'd say if that applies to haskell then it applies to most languages. haskell might have a shallower curve in that respect that others though
11:50:05 <chrisdone> oh, hm
11:50:11 <jmcarthur> *than others
11:50:25 <Veinor> > 0 : (fix $ (1:) . scanl 0 (+))
11:50:30 <Veinor> damn
11:50:37 <shapr> Tzarly: In my experience, Haskell codebases tend to be smaller than others for the same functionality.
11:50:45 <Tzarly> Does the codebase grow as direct function of the size and features of the project/program?
11:50:47 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: any language that gives you facilities for abstraction would have that property
11:50:58 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: but haskell gives you *lots* of ways to abstract things :)
11:51:02 <Veinor> lambdabot, where are you?
11:51:10 <aristid> preflex: seen lambdabot
11:51:10 <preflex>  lambdabot was last seen on #haskell 1 hour, 3 minutes and 24 seconds ago, saying:   <no location info>: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
11:51:23 <shapr> Tzarly: I agree with jmcarthur, abstraction is the key feature for smaller codebases.
11:51:36 <shapr> Tzarly: On the other hand, it's possible to write bad (and good) code in any language.
11:51:49 * j4cbo is probably one of the youngest rabid Standard ML fans in the world
11:51:59 <chrisdone> one interesting property of Haskell is how far you can get without needing macros
11:52:03 <aristid> j4cbo: how young?
11:52:07 <j4cbo> 21
11:52:12 <Philippa> eh, there're younger
11:52:14 <shapr> I've seen beautiful, elegant and easily readable Perl. I've even seen unreadable Haskell twice.
11:52:15 <jmcarthur> that's not young :P
11:52:19 <aristid> j4cbo: i don't think you are the youngest then
11:52:25 <j4cbo> most SML people are old :P
11:52:27 <hpc> chrisdone: unexported functions are basically macros
11:52:29 <Philippa> highly unlikely given that some pick it up as undergrads
11:52:39 <shapr> j4cbo: We've had some 14 year olds here at times.
11:52:55 <Philippa> what happened to sorear, anyway?
11:52:57 <jmcarthur> i wish i had learned haskell when i was 14
11:52:59 <j4cbo> Philippa: yeah, i did myself; but SML is, alas, somewhat dying
11:53:02 <pikhq> chrisdone: Indeed, good languages don't need metaprogramming.
11:53:04 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> shapr: All Haskell is unreadable until you learn how to really read it, though. :)
11:53:04 <chrisdone> i started using haskell when i was 19
11:53:08 <Tzarly> Does Haskell also suffer from programmers trying to "optimize prematurely"?
11:53:16 <Veinor> Tzarly: every language does.
11:53:16 <aristid> pikhq: haskell does need it :)
11:53:16 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: ask dons ;)
11:53:22 <j4cbo> Tzarly: no, it suffers from quite the opposite
11:53:27 <Philippa> j4cbo: yeah. It's a bit of a shame, a new SML with monadic effects and a mixed type class/module system would rock
11:53:27 <Veinor> except in haskell it's more 'okay, how general can I make this code?'
11:53:29 <chrisdone> (actually haskell is older than me)
11:53:46 <Veinor> and then you're knee-deep in type-level programming and monads and cofunctors
11:54:02 <Tzarly> Thanks for the responses guys
11:54:04 <jmcarthur> Veinor: what's a cofunctor? you mean a contrafunctor?
11:54:11 <Veinor> yeah.
11:54:13 <djahandarie> bifunctor maybe
11:54:13 <ybruglrdkrtumkhl> Tzarly: Like others said, the tendency in Haskell coding tends towards over-abstraction rather than over-optimization.
11:54:14 <djahandarie> :(
11:54:14 <jmcarthur> ah
11:54:19 <chrisdone> it's more the opposite for Haskell, I suppose
11:54:20 * perimosocordiae recalls the evolution of a haskell programmer
11:54:23 <danderson> when using an FFI API, what is the criterion to decide whether its use can be unsafePerformIO'd ?
11:54:35 <jmcarthur> danderson: is it referentially transparent?
11:54:39 <aristid> chrisdone: so you're born after 1985...
11:54:42 <chrisdone> I write the nicest implementation that expresses the problem, then I might refactor. sometimes I'll optimise if I really need it
11:54:45 <danderson> is it enough that the function appears to be pure, even though it might maintain caches and other fancy stuff in the C universe?
11:54:46 <djahandarie> There are definitely some bright young people in here
11:54:56 <j4cbo> Philippa: agreed on the second part, not on the first :P
11:54:57 <shapr> Tzarly: That's because lots of naive, general Haskell turns into passably speedy executables.
11:55:00 <dafis> danderson: rule of thumb, if you can do the same in pure haskell, you can use unsafePerformIO
11:55:02 <aristid> chrisdone: or wait, 1987
11:55:07 <jmcarthur> danderson: a pure interface is sufficient, as long as you are *sure*
11:55:16 <aristid> chrisdone: "younger than haskell" is such a terribly imprecise statement
11:55:18 <chrisdone> danderson: "can it be repeated?"
11:55:21 <danderson> jmcarthur: I'm not, but I'm going to do some testing.
11:55:25 <Philippa> ybruglrdkrtumkhl: we optimise our coding rather than the runtime generally, yeah, but people do at least care about performance around here
11:55:28 <j4cbo> Philippa: a solid design for typeclasses in SML exists
11:55:35 <aristid> when was haskell "born"? i mean, does only 1.0 count? does it count when people thought about creating haskell?
11:55:37 * dafis is older than C
11:55:43 <dolio> Philippa: How about a new Haskell with that stuff? :)
11:55:44 <danderson> specifically: HsOpenSSL exports writeX509 :: X509 -> IO String
11:55:46 <j4cbo> it's just not implemented in any of the major SML implementations
11:55:48 <shapr> dafis: When did C start?
11:55:48 <Philippa> j4cbo: well, I'd sooner monads than any other kind of effect system
11:55:50 <aristid> it's not like you could easily pin-point a single day when haskell was created
11:55:58 <pikhq> dafis: So you are one of the Great Old Ones.
11:56:04 <pikhq> dafis: How's the UNIX beard, BTW?
11:56:04 <Philippa> dolio: a strict one? I think it's worth having strict and non-strict languages about, at least
11:56:05 <jmcarthur> danderson: is it thread safe? is it referentially transparent? can it cause other functions to evaluate differently?
11:56:11 <dafis> shapr: 1970 plus/minus two years
11:56:21 <danderson> I'm pretty sure that the PEM string that it outputs depends entirely on the data stored in the X509 struct, which is a mutable ForeignPtr (hence the IO)
11:56:27 <dolio> No. I was thinking Haskell + first-class modules.
11:56:32 <shapr> dafis: Depending on the plus/minus, I may also be older than C.
11:56:32 <dafis> pikhq: shaved, atm
11:56:33 * j4cbo thinks effects should not be part of the type system, though that's a dangerous thing to say around here.
11:56:40 <pikhq> dafis: Baaaah.
11:56:48 <danderson> but I'm newtyping the X509 objects I'm going to use, so I'm certain they won't mutate under me
11:56:49 <shapr> dafis: I'm a '71 model programmer.
11:56:56 <dafis> pikhq: too hot for face fungi
11:57:00 <danderson> so it seems I can unsafePerformIO myself into a less tainted API
11:57:05 <pikhq> j4cbo: You're quite right. We shouldn't have effects.
11:57:06 <pikhq> :P
11:57:07 <shapr> j4cbo: Why do you think that?
11:57:07 <chrisdone> what's the main difference between parameterized modules and typeclasses?
11:57:09 <dafis> shapr: fall of '67
11:57:12 <jmcarthur> j4cbo: no, that's not a dangerous thing to say here. it's not a part of haskell's type system, for example
11:57:33 <jmcarthur> j4cbo: we *use* our type system to make effects safe, but they are not an inherent part of it
11:57:41 <j4cbo> jmcarthur: i'll rephrase - the side-effects that a function has should not be represented in its type.
11:57:53 <shapr> j4cbo: Why?
11:57:54 <aristid> j4cbo: you want every function to be in IO?
11:57:55 <jmcarthur> well, i'll very strongly disagree one that :)
11:57:57 <sproingie> aristid: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/index.htm
11:58:01 <jmcarthur> *on
11:58:06 <j4cbo> because you can't possibly represent *all* side effects anyway - time and memory matter.
11:58:13 <Philippa> dolio: I'd like first-class modules too, as well as functors that can be expected to execute statically where appropriate. There's still grounds for an ML-like lang to exist though and I'd rather it not just be F# so that the next big VM has a warning that unrestricted overloading sucks
11:58:14 <Phyx-> *siGH* another infinite recursion
11:58:14 <pikhq> j4cbo: Haskell does not, properly speaking, represent side effects in a function's type.
11:58:21 <pikhq> All functions are without side effects.
11:58:26 <aristid> sproingie: *sigh* everything has to be in a 55-page paper
11:58:28 <j4cbo> pikhq: you know what i mean.
11:58:31 <djahandarie> It doesn't reflect the specific side effect,
11:58:31 <jmcarthur> j4cbo: time and memory can also be represented in the type system
11:58:35 <ezyang> Theses are kind of long. 
11:58:40 <djahandarie> It just says "this has a side effect"
11:58:41 <jmcarthur> although it's active research
11:58:42 <pikhq> Certain of them happen to result in values that are themselves descriptions of side effects.
11:58:48 <shapr> j4cbo: There are some dependently typed languages that represent at least memory in the type, dunno about time.
11:58:54 <aristid> "In September of 1987 a meeting was held"
11:58:58 <aristid> that's enough for me.
11:58:58 <Philippa> and being able to represent some effects is much better than not being able to represent any
11:58:58 <sproingie> aristid: that paper's been more durable than haskell's wiki
11:59:03 <djahandarie> I don't think time would be possible
11:59:06 <aristid> haskell was born in 1987.
11:59:08 <j4cbo> jmcarthur, shapr: oh, that would be quite interesting
11:59:11 <jmcarthur> time should be especially easy with an indexed monad or something
11:59:11 <djahandarie> Wouldn't that involve the halting problem?
11:59:21 <dolio> Philippa: Yes, certainly F# is kind of a disappointing torch bearer.
11:59:30 <jmcarthur> well, except for the pure portions of it
11:59:36 <pikhq> djahandarie: Not if you make it not TC.
11:59:37 <pikhq> :)
11:59:48 <chrisdone> dolio: heh, I couldn't think of a neat way to describe F#, but there you have it
11:59:49 <monochrom> time is easier than memory
12:00:01 <Philippa> dolio: it's rather limited by its host platform, yeah
12:00:10 <jmcarthur> i suppose time complexity is easier than absolute time
12:00:49 <aristid> chrisdone: somehow i thought you would be older than me, but that's how ideas can turn out to be wrong
12:00:51 <Philippa> djahandarie: parameterised/indexed monads go a long way, as does having multiple monads. The 'real' effect system in haskell isn't just the IO monad
12:01:15 <int80_h> I assume most people here are younger than me.
12:01:35 <jakob__> hi guys
12:01:36 <djahandarie> Philippa, I don't think that's what he was refering to, though
12:02:04 <aristid> int80_h: that assumption might also be wrong. i mean... it's hard to say how old people are if all you know is their irc nick and maybe a few things they've said
12:02:13 <int80_h> okay I have this problem to solve. I need to think about it. I'll probably put something on hpaste so I can get help working it out
12:02:22 <Philippa> djahandarie: the halting problem only applies to functions per se, btw. Annotated functions are another matter
12:02:39 * BMeph thinks it'd be more appropriate (FSVO...) to say that Haskell was conceived in 1987, vice born
12:02:41 <Philippa> (to put it another way: if you demand a proof that it halts, all's fine and dandy)
12:03:02 <djahandarie> Annotated functions?
12:03:02 <monochrom> proof-checking is O(n).
12:03:12 <perimosocordiae> Phillipa: could you explain what you mean by annotated functions?
12:03:34 <Philippa> perimosocordiae: \a::Int -> a <- this is annotated, with the fact a is of type Int
12:03:45 <j4cbo> and it's easy to produce a proof of termination for many common programming patterns
12:03:48 <Alucard> hi all
12:03:55 <Philippa> any structure that you can project a function from, but which contains more structure than just the function
12:04:18 <Guest67398> damn you nickserv... damn you
12:04:29 <j4cbo> (structural induction - if l is finite, and f terminates on any input, then map f l terminates)
12:04:41 <perimosocordiae> is that at all related to type-hinting things like 'read'?
12:04:42 <aristid> j4cbo: is it also practical? is the effort manageable?
12:04:45 <jmcarthur> oh i get it. people are getting timed out of their chosen nicks because they are registered
12:04:57 <djahandarie> Philippa, so you mean when the domain is finite the halting problem doesn't apply?
12:04:59 <j4cbo> aristid: that part is less clear :P
12:05:16 <aristid> choosing nicks like test or D...
12:05:32 <Philippa> djahandarie: no, I mean that if you have more information than just the function itself, you're not necessarily dealing with the halting problem per se
12:05:54 <djahandarie> Can you link me to something
12:06:01 <Tomsik__> you can do Hoare-style annotations
12:06:22 <Tomsik__> I guess it's partially automaticable
12:06:41 <j4cbo> djahandarie: look up "proof-carrying code"
12:06:41 <jmcarthur> djahandarie: you can't prove that an arbitrary function terminates, but you can devise an algorithm that proves that certain classes of functions terminate, and you can also prove whether functions are members of those classes of functions
12:06:51 <Philippa> djahandarie: start with the Curry-Howard isomorphism, attach a proof that the function terminates, then attach the typing for function+proof. Now you're just checking that the typing is legit against a finite structure
12:07:14 <Tomsik__> there's things like Strictly Positive Types, which indicate that a function always halts
12:07:17 <Philippa> note that the typing can tell you /how long the proof takes to terminate/
12:07:37 <djahandarie> Hmmm
12:07:38 <Philippa> IOW, once someone's proven it terminates once, you can carry that proof about. Now you just need someone to prove it
12:07:41 <Saizan> total programming languages like Agda or Coq have some (still quite limited) termination checkers built in, e.g. structurally recursive functions don't need any extra proof of termination
12:08:29 <dolio> System F doesn't even need a termination checker. :)
12:08:36 <monochrom> ...
12:08:53 <Req> Hello
12:08:58 <chrisdone> hi
12:09:03 <Veinor> Hi.
12:09:09 <Phyx-> System F is undecidable
12:09:09 <Saizan> monochrom: ?
12:09:17 <Req> Is Haskell cool?
12:09:23 <Saizan> Phyx-: type inference is undecidable
12:09:24 <dafis> Req: yes
12:09:43 <Phyx-> Saizan: yes, 
12:09:52 <dolio> Type checking is decidable.
12:09:53 <Veinor> Req: All the cool kids are doing it.
12:10:01 <Phyx-> Saizan: i though you were talking about inferencing
12:10:07 <Phyx-> which is why i didn't qualify it
12:10:10 <dolio> Type inference is decidable for Church-style terms, too, but that's trivial.
12:10:18 <Req> How is it for someone who has no prior programming experience?
12:10:21 <j4cbo> type inference is decidable for a lot of languages...
12:10:31 <Tomsik__> Req: like any other language
12:10:40 <Philippa> Req: surprisingly easy if you're good at maths
12:10:40 <Tomsik__> if you've programmed already, not so :p
12:10:48 <Philippa> that's high-school good, not necessarily phd good
12:10:50 <Phyx-> alot of languages *don't* have a strong type system
12:11:13 <chrisdone> jesus: are you spanish?
12:11:20 <chris_____> no
12:11:22 <jesus> o.O
12:11:36 <Guest16408> :(
12:11:42 <Guest16408> what
12:11:43 <Guest16408> the hell
12:11:49 <chrisdone> ah, i have a friend at work called jesus, he's spanish
12:12:05 <Saizan> Guest16408: "jesus" is a registered nick, so you've pick another
12:12:07 <dafis> chrisdone: also quite common in Portugal
12:12:14 <Req> What is the best source for beginning in Haskell?
12:12:24 <Guest16408> f
12:12:25 <Guest16408> this
12:12:35 <dafis> Req: learn you a Haskell is pretty good

12:12:47 <monochrom> learnyouahaskell.com
12:12:51 <Phyx-> Saizan: lambdabot is dead
12:12:52 <djahandarie> lol
12:13:01 <chrisdone> i for one welcome our  new monobot 
12:13:06 <Tomsik__> Haven't you heard, bot is dead.
12:13:16 <Saizan> long life to the bot
12:13:40 <dafis> I just hope bot doesn't reach nirvana too soon
12:13:46 <Phyx-> we have the technology,,,
12:13:49 <Phyx-> we can rebuild it
12:13:50 <chrisdone> i miss vixen
12:13:53 <Phyx-> faster, stronger
12:13:56 <nick_> hi
12:13:58 <chrisdone> @vixen what's your favourite song?
12:14:00 <Phyx-> more threaded than before
12:14:08 <monochrom> I am above songs
12:14:12 <Phyx-> lambdabot 2.0
12:14:25 <Saizan> dunno, it was pretty threaded already
12:14:30 <Phyx-> lol
12:14:46 <Phyx-> hi Guest50765 
12:15:21 * BMeph hails Our New monobot overlord...
12:15:29 <aristid> @faq Is monochrom the new replacement for lambdabot?
12:15:40 <monochrom> yes, monochrom can do that!
12:15:44 <Phyx-> hmm would you consider -- a\n -- b\n \t -- c to be a block of 3 single line comments or two?
12:16:04 <Guest50765> anyone play tf2?
12:16:09 <djahandarie> @pl (\x f a e -> f a e . x y z uncurry f)
12:16:26 <zygoloid> Phyx-: What Would Haddock Do? :)
12:16:26 <monochrom> I may count that as two.
12:16:26 <aristid> Guest50765: this is not the place to find gaming partners, sorry
12:16:35 <Phyx-> zygoloid: I have no idea :P
12:16:36 <Veinor> lambdabot is down :/
12:16:39 <Associat0r> dolio: chrisdone: what's dissapointing about F#?
12:16:43 <monochrom> haddock may count that as one
12:16:54 <Phyx-> monochrom: yeah, i'm currentyly counting it as two aswell
12:17:02 <Phyx-> and only allowing you to fold those two
12:17:05 <dolio> Associat0r: They took out ML's modules, which are probably its coolest feature.
12:17:13 <freakazoid> why does it keep crashing went i follow the tutorial (up to lesson 2)?
12:17:27 <djahandarie> freakazoid, are you on opera?
12:17:39 <freakazoid> nope, firefox
12:17:45 <aristid> opera users must be punished for their bad choice of browser
12:17:51 <Associat0r> dolio: yes
12:18:10 <djahandarie> freakazoid, hm, that's weird, OSX?
12:18:18 <dafis> aristid: I always hear people claiming Opera is the best, most compliant, ...
12:18:25 <freakazoid> no, win xp pro
12:18:35 <Req> Thanks for the intro guys. :)
12:18:39 <djahandarie> Odd
12:18:41 <Associat0r> dolio: but they added other good stuff
12:18:42 <freakazoid> could it be the firewall?
12:18:54 <aristid> dafis: i can't say that's my impression
12:19:01 <monochrom> does not crash on me
12:19:03 <djahandarie> I have no idea, I don't think anyone else has had problems on Firefox/Win
12:19:25 <aristid> freakazoid: what do you mean by "crash"? error boxes?
12:19:27 <dafis> aristid: I have never tried Opera, I can only say what I hear people say
12:19:50 <chrisdone> freakazoid: I guess you'll just have to install GHC `\o_o/`
12:20:04 <aristid> @where haskell platform
12:20:10 <freakazoid> well, i m at work atm and my network is heavily monitored all the time, i'll do it when i get home
12:20:17 <steveklabnik> aristid: lambdabot is dead
12:20:26 <aristid> steveklabnik: yes but we have monochrom :D
12:20:28 <steveklabnik> haha
12:20:37 <steveklabnik> my bad
12:20:38 <Phyx-> aristid: it's slow though :P
12:20:46 <pk> who's from reddit?
12:20:46 <monochrom> http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
12:20:46 <aristid> Phyx-: must have bad hardware
12:20:52 <Phyx-> hehehe
12:20:58 <dolio> Associat0r: Yes, but that alone makes it unsatisfying for carrying on ML into actual popularity.
12:21:10 <chrisdone> pk: bout 5% here
12:21:12 <jmcarthur> Req: learning haskell is probably actually *easier* in a lot of ways if you don't know any other languages
12:21:18 * monochrom has too many threads, too few cores
12:21:25 <rcarlos21> hey, whoever the admin or moderator is, just wanted to say that your tryhaskell page is very well done. kudos to you guys!
12:21:33 <Veinor> who wrote tryhaskell anyway?
12:21:36 <jmcarthur> rcarlos21: that would be chrisdone :)
12:21:37 <aristid> rcarlos21: chrisdone
12:21:37 <djahandarie> Chris did
12:21:39 <jmcarthur> Veinor: ^^
12:21:41 <chrisdone> thanks :)
12:21:46 <Veinor> :D
12:21:53 <rcarlos21> well chrisdone, well done!
12:21:55 <djahandarie> Chris done it
12:21:57 <chrisdone> ~_~
12:22:05 <mikebling> yeah nice job
12:22:07 <chrisdone> I get enough of this at work
12:22:10 <chrisdone> I hate you guys
12:22:11 <dafis> chris done it well
12:22:12 <Phyx-> hahaha
12:22:14 <steveklabnik> lol
12:22:17 <Phyx-> HAHAAHA
12:22:23 * Phyx- falls down laughing
12:22:27 <rcarlos21> haha i didnt mean to make a pun
12:22:36 <kmc> tee hee
12:22:40 <aloy> hi guys
12:22:43 <djahandarie> Hi
12:22:52 <chrisdone> rcarlos21: how far did you get in the tutorial?
12:23:03 <foo_> why can't I do this foo="string" \n print foo
12:23:16 <chrisdone> foo_: which part errors? the print foo part?
12:23:19 <foo_> says not in scope: 
12:23:25 <mikebling> someone should make a little schemer webapp
12:23:31 <Req> Yeah, I was lead here by Tryhaskell.
12:23:32 <chrisdone> foo_: not in scope "print"?
12:23:47 <foo_> not in scope 'foo'
12:23:58 <Phyx-> does ghc accept a pragma tag that spans multiple lines?
12:24:07 <Lemmih> Phyx-: Yes.
12:24:11 <monochrom> you can evaluate expressions but you can't define things in that box.
12:24:13 <aristid> chrisdone: you should improve the error message for IO values
12:24:15 <eavhwrlmfwqjtasp> Hmm, that does seem weird, I just tried {let foo = "string"} and that doesn't work either.
12:24:16 <kmc> foo_, Haskell doesn't have assignment like that
12:24:28 <Phyx-> Lemmih: good! less work then :)
12:24:28 <kmc> foo_, let foo = "string" in print foo
12:24:28 <aristid> chrisdone: perhaps just do what lambdabot does and show "<IO ()>"?
12:24:33 <rcarlos21> i've only gotten a little bit into. i was just impressed by how well it worked.
12:24:34 <chrisdone> aristid: i'll add a Show instance for a -> b, now. that'd sort it out
12:24:43 <monochrom> But try this: let foo="string" in length foo
12:24:51 <aristid> chrisdone: that doesn't help for print "foo"
12:25:01 <hiboss> who knows a good porno site
12:25:05 <Phyx-> o.O
12:25:17 <aristid> eavhwrlmfwqjtasp: you're surprised that random invalid code doesn't work?
12:25:23 <monochrom> good prono site: tryhaskell.org
12:25:30 <aristid> it's unheard of that a language has different syntax than people think
12:25:33 <hiboss> woooord.
12:25:44 <roconnor> > do { let foo = "string"; print foo }
12:25:49 <chrisdone> aristid: oh yeah, IO too. sorry, distracted
12:25:51 <mtnviewmark> oooooo baby.... show me your monads....
12:25:54 <dafis> roconnor: no bot now
12:25:55 <mtnviewmark> uhm
12:25:56 <Lemmih> hiboss: That depends. Do you like monoids or monads? Or perhaps you swing both ways?
12:25:57 <djahandarie> roconnor, your plans are foiled, no bot!
12:26:00 <eavhwrlmfwqjtasp> It doesn't? My understanding was that let binding was valid?
12:26:08 <aristid> chrisdone: how many hits is the site getting?
12:26:08 <aloy> roar
12:26:08 <mtnviewmark> wait - did I say that out loud?!?!?!?
12:26:20 <chrisdone> I functor
12:26:20 <kmc> eavhwrlmfwqjtasp, the syntax is "let ... in ...", except in "do"
12:26:22 <chrisdone> tee hee
12:26:27 <aloy> why doesnt it load ?
12:26:31 <kmc> eavhwrlmfwqjtasp, in "do" there is a bit of sugar to make the "in" part implicitly the rest of the do block
12:26:37 <mtnviewmark> that said - I love tryhaskell.org --
12:26:42 <foo_> wow none of these suggestions have worked.  you can't just assign a string to a variable and print that variable?
12:26:50 <kmc> foo_, correct.  Haskell doesn't have assignment
12:26:52 <mtnviewmark> how far has it gotten - lesson 11 was the last I looked
12:27:05 <jmcarthur> foo_: you are using tryhaskell?
12:27:10 <foo_> yes
12:27:11 <aristid> kmc: don't top-level definitions count?
12:27:13 <kmc> no
12:27:14 <roconnor> foo_: (let foo = "string" in print foo)
12:27:17 <djahandarie> foo_, let x = "blah" in x
12:27:19 <jmcarthur> foo_: let foo = "string"
12:27:32 <djahandarie> foo_, which would just end up being "blah"
12:27:37 <mtnviewmark> oh - I mean it was step11 - now up to 25! woot
12:27:37 <aristid> foo_: tryhaskell does not allow I/O actions, because that would be dangerous for the server
12:27:47 <kmc> foo_, to which there's two typical responses
12:27:51 <Associat0r> dolio: I don't think so, what's most important is it's a solid implementation on a solid platform
12:27:56 <kmc> "a language without assignment is retarded"
12:28:11 <kmc> or "wow, a language without assignment must work in some really interesting different way"
12:28:24 <foo_> oh, ok.  got it.  can I do lambda expressions?
12:28:25 <jmcarthur> i've never seen anybody say that ;)
12:28:26 <kmc> yes
12:28:29 <Jafet> You could make stdin/stdout functions return ST instead.
12:28:31 <kmc> (\x -> x + 3) 4
12:28:34 <dolio> Associat0r: That might make it a fine language. But not an admirable ML.
12:28:42 <jmcarthur> where's lambdabot? :(

12:30:22 <jmcarthur> foo_: i like haskell *much* better than scheme. i don't know where you heard that scheme is the new python, which doesn't really make sense to me
12:30:23 <Associat0r> dolio: and yes higher order modules would have been nice to have but it's not a dealbreaker
12:30:32 <Phyx-> aristid: doesn't look like it
12:30:32 <zygoloid> yeah. but apparently installing lambdabot doesn't install mueval :o
12:30:38 <djahandarie> Nope it doesn't

12:31:34 <hpc> or INTERCAL
12:31:43 <steveklabnik> jmcarthur: yeah, they are. as far as I know. I'm just saying maybe he heard and got it backwards, is all. I do that a lot.
12:31:49 <jmcarthur> ah
12:32:16 <aristid> hpc: or brainfuck
12:32:17 <jmcarthur> i really disagree with their decision to switch from scheme to python. scheme was so much more instructive and had a much lower barrier to entry
12:32:20 <kmc> saying "Scheme is the new X" is pretty funny because the Lisp family of languages invented most concepts 30+ years before they hit the mainstream
12:32:44 <chrisdone> scheme was defined in 1986 or something like that, iirc
12:32:49 <Veinor> scheme is the guy that was into owl city before he made it big, maaan
12:32:49 <jmcarthur> it's nice to get the sytnax out of the way in like a minute
12:33:00 <chrisdone> okay, 1975. wow
12:33:03 <jmcarthur> *syntax
12:33:19 <kmc> jmcarthur, Scheme syntax is decently complicated.  it's only 1 minute if you consider Scheme as a language for specifying lists, not programs
12:33:24 <perimosocordiae> jmcarthur: from what I've read, they moved to python for better library support
12:33:27 <kmc> i.e., i argue that each special form is part of the syntax
12:33:36 <Veinor> but with python we get to build robots!

12:36:19 <kmc> in particular, syntax is static

12:37:13 * hpc wants caleskell as a hackage package
12:37:37 <dafis> hpc: how would that interact with haskell98?
12:37:44 <dolio> jmcarthur: Lisp has a complex abstract syntax that looks superficially simple because it's defined as picking out certain shapes/annotations of a rose tree.
12:37:44 <jmcarthur> hpc: as long as we import it qualified in lambdabot ;)
12:37:45 <hpc> dafis: spectacularly
12:37:49 <chrisdone> i made a scheme in c++

12:38:08 <monochrom> haha
12:38:33 <aristid> chrisdone: never say never.
12:38:36 <hpc> i mod for the Source engine; Valve has altered the language through macros enough to be almost usable
12:38:49 <chrisdone> aristid: ever say ever?
12:38:59 <aristid> chrisdone: :P
12:39:03 <jmcarthur> forth would be an interesting language to teach to a beginner. i wonder if that has been done in an academic setting before
12:39:15 <monochrom> I never say never.
12:39:22 <jmcarthur> that's my guess too
12:39:42 <aristid> @faq Ever say never?
12:39:43 <zygotron> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
12:39:43 <dolio> It has let and case and etc. just like Haskell does. The syntax is just specified as "this shape of tree" instead of the way most other languages do it.
12:40:01 <jmcarthur> i say interesting just because it's so low level but simple
12:40:15 <chrisdone> yeah, forth is interesting in that way
12:40:21 <jmcarthur> and gives you the ability to make some pretty interesting high level words
12:40:28 <hpc> jmcarthur: plenty of low-level stuff can be simple; just not x86 assembler
12:40:36 <jmcarthur> no, not x86 ;)
12:40:49 <dolio> So syntax errors are "I wasn't expecting a tree of this shape" instead of "I wasn't expecting this token."
12:41:03 <fryguybob> I think some people have done some postscript based graphics courses and that's not too far from forth.
12:41:11 <jmcarthur> i was taught computer architecture using MIPS as our running example. it's pretty simple. still nowhere near the simplicity of something like forth though
12:41:22 * Veinor gets to work writing Learn You A COBOL
12:41:24 <jmcarthur> MIPS assembler, i mean
12:41:37 <hpc> MIPS has yucky syntax; it looks like Perl with all the $
12:41:56 <chrisdone> well, once you define define-syntax and IF, the rest is gravy
12:42:06 <jmcarthur> it's hard for me to think of MIPS as having any syntax aside from the binary representation
12:42:14 <aristid> hpc: you could write an alternative assembly syntax for the same binary code

12:55:08 <fryguybob> The only sticking points I had when writing interpreters for forth and postscript is when the interpreter hands the scanner over to the currently executing code.  I'm not sure how to do that cleanly in Haskell.

13:10:10 <sbahra> Learner1, System.out.println "Hello World" is not the same as "Hello World".
13:10:39 <sbahra> Learner1, such a side-effect is encapsulated in the I/O monad, try doing putStrLn "Hello World".
13:10:43 <Jafet> Of course you can write Java in Haskell.
13:10:55 <djahandarie> I don't know why it needs to be called the IO monad
13:10:56 <zomnom> heyoooooooooo
13:11:08 <chrisdone> sbahra: I think for Java programmers, a REPL is novel. the concept of just writing "Hello" is neat coming from these type of languages
13:11:10 <djahandarie> Just call it the IO type or something else
13:11:28 <Jafet> main::IO(); main = System.IO.hPutStrLn System.IO.stdout "Hello, world!"
13:11:50 <sbahra> djahandarie, because it's a monad? :-P

13:15:19 <Learner1> well, by enlightenment I meant that suddenly it felt like I could program anythign with LISP
13:15:21 <jmcarthur> we should call it the real-world state monad
13:15:45 <Learner1> then i tried programming a GUI, and found out i COULD program anything, but something are better done in other languages

13:19:53 <asdgfasdg> question, why does :t 1 give :: (Num t) => t?
13:19:53 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: the next step is checking out Real World Haskell :D
13:20:13 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: seeing as I wrote it, maybe I should explain it
13:20:39 <asdgfasdg> chrisdone: you wrote tryhaskell.org, or real world haskell?

13:20:48 <asdgfasdg> nice
13:20:58 <BMeph> "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing." -- Alan Perlis
13:21:15 <SyQo> ^
13:21:17 <decaf_> what is haskell?
13:21:21 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: "Num" is a type class
13:21:40 <Saizan> decaf_: haskell is a programming language
13:21:58 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: a type class is a set of methods. a method is just any Haskell value or function like a number or the addition function (+)
13:22:02 <chrisdone> @src Num
13:22:02 <zygotron> class  (Eq a, Show a) => Num a  where
13:22:02 <zygotron>     (+), (-), (*)           :: a -> a -> a
13:22:02 <zygotron>     negate, abs, signum     :: a -> a
13:22:02 <zygotron>     fromInteger             :: Integer -> a
13:22:32 <asdgfasdg> ok
13:22:34 <chrisdone> if a type a is an *instance* of the Num class, it implements the methods (+), (-), (*), etc. you see listed there
13:22:50 <chrisdone> turns out there are all sorts of types for numbers
13:22:59 <asdgfasdg> chrisdone: maybe a more basic question is, what does => mean?
13:23:24 <Tzarly> int, float, short, byte, word, long, long long, unsigned long long ...
13:23:25 <hpc> the thing on the left is a constraint, the thing on the right is the actual type of the function
13:23:31 <asdgfasdg> it it sort of like, "where t is in the num type class, the type of 1 is t"? i.e. 1 is not a num, but it satisfies the num type class?
13:23:44 <hpc> so 1 is any t, so long as t is an instance of Num
13:23:46 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: you read "Num a => a" as, for all types 'a' that are instances of Num
13:23:48 <asdgfasdg> yeah.
13:23:49 <pikhq> asdgfasdg: You can read that as "Class 'Num a', where 'a' is an Eq and a Show."
13:23:54 <asdgfasdg> thanks, that makes sense
13:24:11 <nolrai___> > Nothing > Just 0
13:24:12 <zygotron>   False
13:24:13 <pikhq> asdgfasdg: It works the same in a function's type; foo :: (Num a) => a -> a
13:24:27 <asdgfasdg> right
13:24:29 <chrisdone> :t 1
13:24:29 <zygotron> forall t. (Num t) => t
13:24:29 <Saizan> asdgfasdg: it's not 1 that will satisfy the Num typeclass, but its type
13:24:30 <chrisdone> :t (+)
13:24:31 <zygotron> forall a. (Num a) => a -> a -> a
13:24:34 <asdgfasdg> interesting
13:24:50 <Ambroticus> Hello. Im doing tutorial on "tryhaskell.org". I'm wondering how to create 2 args functions?
13:25:01 <Ambroticus> Like let pow x=x**­y in pow (3,5)
13:25:01 <nolrai___> > Just 0 < Nothing
13:25:02 <zygotron>   False
13:25:08 <pikhq> Ambroticus: "foo x y = do stuff with x y".
13:25:16 <zygoloid> > let pow x y = x ** y in pow 3 5
13:25:17 <zygotron>   243.0
13:25:22 <Ambroticus> ah, thanks
13:25:26 <zygoloid> > let pow (x, y) = x ** y in pow (3, 5)
13:25:27 <zygotron>   243.0
13:25:40 <hpc> you don't want to use tuples as arguments though; it breaks currying
13:25:42 <zygoloid> but the first way is the normal way in haskell
13:25:43 <arbitrarylogic> although they only appear to be 2 args functions
13:25:50 <nolrai___> > (Just 0 < Nothing, Just 0 > Nothing, Just 0 == Nothing)
13:25:51 <zygotron>   (False,True,False)
13:25:51 <zygoloid> hpc: you mean partial application, surely?
13:26:09 <hpc> zygoloid: the two are mostly the same
13:26:09 <Jafet> Tuples aren't strict, and see curry/uncurry
13:26:39 <zygoloid> hpc: currying is using a function returning a function to represent a multi-argument function.
13:26:42 <pikhq> Ambroticus: Something good to know is that technically, what you do when you do that is create a function of one argument that returns a function of one argument. That is to say, "pow x y = x ** y" is the same as "pow x = \y -> x ** y".
13:26:48 <Saizan> well currying _is_ not using tuples for multiple arguments
13:27:07 <alpounet> is there a way to get all the combinations of elements from 6 lists without writing explicitly the list comprehension taking one element from each of the 6 lists and so on ?
13:27:14 <chrisdone> pikhq: imo, you have to introduce what 
13:27:18 <chrisdone> \x -> y means

13:29:06 <asdgfasdg> so how do i actually define a function in the global scope? like say i want to define pow globally, not in a local block
13:29:14 <asdgfasdg> or expression or whatever
13:29:24 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: try: pow x y = x ** y
13:29:32 <asdgfasdg> pow x y = x ** y gives no error on tryhaskell.org, though ghci gives me a compile error
13:29:43 <asdgfasdg> and in tryhaskell.org the function doesn't actually work after i define it
13:29:44 <dafis> asdgfasdg: just put it in a source file
13:29:50 <zygoloid> asdgfasdg: interactively in ghci or when loaded from a file?
13:29:57 <asdgfasdg> interactively
13:29:58 * hackagebot uu-parsinglib 2.4.0 - Online, error-correcting parser combinators; monadic and applicative interfaces  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uu-parsinglib-2.4.0 (DoaitseSwierstra)
13:29:59 <zygotron> Title: HackageDB: uu-parsinglib-2.4.0
13:30:04 <Saizan> in ghci you can do "let pow x y = x ** y"
13:30:07 <zygoloid> asdgfasdg: the ghci interactive session is like a big 'do' block -- you need to write: let pow x y = x ** y
13:30:14 <guest_> pow pow powerwheels
13:30:27 <chrisdone> asdgfasdg: it doesn't work after you define it? hm, ok. it's (top-level binding) supported on tryhaskell, but buggy. that's why i don't mention it in the tutorial
13:30:41 <asdgfasdg> zygoloid: ah... without an in block? that works in ghci, except it doesn't work in tryhaskell.org
13:31:13 <zygoloid> asdgfasdg: yeah, tryhaskell only evaluates expressions. (like the > thing here)
13:31:14 <asdgfasdg> ah well. i suppose these are the limitations of a web-based interpreter ;)
13:31:28 <Tzarly> wheris su
13:31:48 <Ambroticus> Is there haskell for debian in repos, or do i have to compile it manually?
13:31:49 <zygoloid> Tzarly: su: /usr/bin/su 
13:32:00 <chrisdone> Ambroticus: sure there is. apt-get install ghc
13:32:17 <Tzarly> thank you zygoloid
13:32:21 <hpc> sprinkle sudo as necessary
13:32:25 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: an actual ghci session that's been jailed with something like ptrace and heavily resource capped might be nice :)
13:32:25 <dafis> I think it's libghc6
13:32:40 <hpc> no, libghc6 is the prefix for libs
13:32:47 <jmcarthur> could even allow certain kinds of IO that way (as long as it doesn't invoke a dangerous syscall)
13:32:51 <hpc> ghc is ghc
13:32:59 <djahandarie> Heh wow still on the reddit frontpage
13:33:01 <Jafet> You can do what codepad or ideone do (adapt geordi for instance)
13:33:06 <jmcarthur> exactly
13:33:07 <dafis> ah, okay, only ever used apt a long time ago
13:33:12 <Tzarly> I can't believe noone corrected zygoloid?
13:33:19 <asdgfasdg> is there like a big fat operator/keyword precedence table somewhere? i have a hard time understanding most examples because it isn't obvious how the syntax is parsed
13:33:54 <zygoloid> asdgfasdg: here's one i made earlier: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27894
13:34:01 <dafis> Tzarly: because it's /bin/su ?
13:34:04 <hpc> asdgfasdg: usually, there's only one way for a line to typecheck
13:34:25 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: maybe if someone else implements that on their own machine and gives me setup instructions
13:34:28 <Jafet> Maybe zygoloid has a strange system.
13:34:37 <zygoloid> it's both /bin/su and /usr/bin/su on hurd :)

13:35:00 <hpc> is infix left or right?
13:35:00 <asdgfasdg> hpc: something like that, but i mean more of the syntax, like how all of those operators have less than 'let' and 'in' keywords, and let/in delimit an expression
13:35:12 <hpc> or something stranger?
13:35:19 <dafis> hpc: infix is neither
13:35:20 <roconnor> ugh

13:42:14 <hpc> spendip: why use any programming language?
13:42:16 <dafis> jmcarthur: sure, maybe I wonder enough to write the script :)

13:42:32 <dafis> spendip: because it's funnnnn
13:42:37 <chrisdone> the output is constant expressions
13:42:46 <c_wraith> dafis: Oh, I totally misparsed your question.  "(how many) people" rather than "how (many people)"
13:42:56 <spendip> hpc: good question?
13:43:25 <eavhwrlmfwqjtasp> chrisdone: TryHaskell suggestion. 'step22' should probably accept this: let (_,a:_) = (10,"abc") in a

13:48:56 <chrisdone> dafis: fixed it

13:49:03 <zygotron>   4
13:49:07 <poucet> poincare101: anyways, check hackage.haskell.org for existing libs 
13:49:19 <Saizan> there should be quite a few linear algebra ones
13:49:19 <poucet> some of them will be more in alpha than others, so probably a good starting line.
13:49:26 <poincare101> poucet: I see, its sort of like CPAN...
13:49:26 <eavhwrlmfwqjtasp> chrisdone: Whoa, I didn't even have to refresh the page; good job :)
13:49:31 <poucet> poincare101: correct =)
13:49:37 <lispy> poincare101: what type of maths do you want?  High level close to logic or low level number crunching?
13:49:55 <Tzarly> I'd like to challenge the Haskell devs to a quick challenge. Pure curiosity. What would be an easy mechanism in Haskell to place four words next to each other to form a 64 bit number?
13:49:56 <poincare101> lispy: number crunching, engineering/physics type stuff. 
13:50:39 <mauke> > 4 * 4 * 8
13:50:40 <zygotron>   128
13:50:47 <lispy> poincare101: I see.  There are several packages that lift units into the types so that you can be sure your calculations have the right units
13:50:48 <mauke> oh, you're using 16 bit words
13:50:55 <dafis> Tzarly: four words would give 128 or 256 bits, wouldn't they?
13:51:17 <Tzarly> 16 * 4 = 64
13:51:24 <Tzarly> 8 BYTE
13:51:32 <Tzarly> 16 WORD
13:51:36 <zygoloid> Tzarly: 'word' does not have a precise meaning in general

13:51:59 <poucet> zygoloid: nibble does =)
13:52:27 <nolrai___> is there some library function equal to (maybe (return Nothing)) `cause I seem to use that a lot. 
13:52:52 <Saizan> ?type maybe (return Nothing)
13:52:52 <chrisdone> lol, someone just entered "monad" in the tryhaskell prompt
13:52:53 <zygotron> forall a (m :: * -> *) a1. (Monad m) => (a1 -> m (Maybe a)) -> Maybe a1 -> m (Maybe a)
13:53:02 <eavhwrlmfwqjtasp> Tzarly: You'd probably want to use the Word16 and Word64 types from Data.Word
13:53:06 <Tzarly> dafis I'm not quite with you just yet, thanks mauke
13:53:19 <Saizan> nolrai___: sounds like you might want to use the MaybeT transformer
13:53:35 <Tzarly> could you give a brief description of foldl please?

13:54:53 <mauke> zygoloid: still in Numeric
13:54:53 <Saizan> at Numeric
13:55:11 <zygoloid> huh. fair enough :)
13:55:49 <zygoloid> is it just Numeric, Prelude and Foreign at the top level?
13:56:53 <dafis> zygoloid: and the h98 modules
13:57:07 <zygoloid> dafis: well, they don't count ;-)

14:02:39 <dafis> doesn't mean it's the best choice for everything, though
14:02:43 <jmcarthur> i am currently using haskell to make an indie game
14:02:44 <aristid> dafis: the half of jmcarthur says weird things like "be able haskell"
14:02:45 <Ambroticus> So it is capable of operating on Direct3d?
14:02:55 <shapr> Oh, I really like blaze-html!
14:03:04 <chrisdone> shapr: me too
14:03:12 <mauke> Ambroticus: direct3d? isn't that a windows thing?
14:03:28 <Ambroticus> mauke: it is available on Windows and Linux
14:03:30 <jmcarthur> aristid: i have this thing where i don't read what i type before i send it, and my fingers have this thing where they type something having the appearance of being sensible until you look closely
14:03:39 <hpc> it can interface with Direct3D
14:03:40 <Jafet> direct3d isn't an operating system

14:03:48 <jmcarthur> Ambroticus: if it has a C API you can interface to it with haskell
14:03:58 <shapr> Isn't SDL available on Windows?
14:04:04 <Ambroticus> It is.
14:04:12 <aristid> jmcarthur: is that because you lost the half of your body that connects finger and brain?

14:11:38 <chrisdone> there isn't a guide on the haskell platform web site
14:11:38 <chrisdone> ?
14:12:00 <hpc> why would you want the platform on ubuntu?
14:12:03 <chrisdone> oh, deploying
14:12:11 <hpc> everything you need is in apt
14:12:12 <chrisdone> good question
14:12:14 <fxr> I promised myself, I never wrote a single webapp without CPS.
14:12:36 <shapr> hpc: Ubuntu libs aren't always as up to the minute as cabal.
14:12:43 <hpc> ah
14:12:52 <jmcarthur> s/aren't always/are never/
14:13:15 <shapr> There's always that tension between using the distro packaging system and using cabal.
14:13:20 <aristid> shapr: i use cabal on ubuntu without the platform
14:13:23 <chrisdone> yeah
14:13:37 <chrisdone> me too
14:13:52 <chrisdone> on OS X the platform was handy, just to get started
14:14:34 <cads> hpc, the thing is that I'd like the whole thing without having to install a bunch of binary dependencies through apt each time a cabal build doesn't work
14:14:45 <sproingie> best solution is you make the packaging system play along.  see BSDPAN
14:15:20 <cads> I think it should be possible to make a custom debian package
14:15:26 <shapr> That would be nifty.
14:15:38 <Tzarly> It's nearly midnight where I am and I'm find it very difficult to write functions which write functions. Any ideas?
14:15:40 <shapr> I'd like to be able to automatically generate a deb from a cabal package.
14:15:51 <shapr> Tzarly: What do you want to do?
14:16:30 <cantropy> hello world, I am trying "Try Haskell". Just want to say that it is fine piece of work ... !
14:16:36 <aristid> shapr: it would be cool if cabal itself could automatically generate debs instead of actually installing
14:16:41 <shapr> Hiya cantropy! Got any questions?
14:16:47 <shapr> aristid: Yeah, that would be nifty.
14:16:58 <fxr> Tzarly: do you need something like macros?
14:16:59 <aristid> cantropy: ask about the relation between Applicative and Monad!
14:17:01 <Tzarly> proof of concept. is it possible to feed a function generated at runtime into another fnnction
14:17:11 <Tzarly> I think fxr's got it
14:17:19 <cantropy> actually no, just wanted to see how the irc within browser works. seems pretty good
14:17:39 <aristid> cantropy: it uses freenode's official webchat thingie
14:17:52 <aristid> http://freenode.net/
14:17:53 <cantropy> aristid: what is the relation between Applicative and Monad?

14:18:04 <Saizan> aristid, shapr: someone has a tool to make .deb's from .cabal's but never made a public release
14:18:07 <jmcarthur> cantropy: congratulate chrisdone for tryhaskell :)
14:18:14 <shapr> Saizan: Ah, that's too bad. It would be a handy tool.
14:18:18 * shapr hugs chrisdone
14:18:21 <shapr> chrisdone++
14:18:24 <jmcarthur> cantropy: all monads are applicatives, but not the other way around
14:18:38 <Tzarly> Well Done Chris! :)
14:18:42 <cads> heh, right now to do the necessarry 'cabal update; cabal install cabal-install' I had to find the package libzlib1g-dev, where 6 simpler named zlib source packages didn't have install candidates
14:18:52 <cantropy> chris: thank you.!
14:18:56 <lll> hello everyone from reddit.com
14:19:01 <jmcarthur> cantropy: one difference is that monads are able to do different effects depending on value. applicatives are not
14:19:14 <illissius-> blarhghghrhghg
14:19:16 * AnAdorableNick ghcis chrisdone 
14:19:19 <Tzarly> hey LLL
14:19:22 <aristid> cantropy: well, Applicative is a more general class than Monad. unfortunately not every Monad is automatically an Applicative, but every "good one" is. the main difference is that Monads support the join operation, which allows among other things, sequencing the results of actions into other actions, or writing parsers that are context-sensitive.
14:19:25 <Tzarly> I mean lll
14:19:36 <Tzarly> I mean 111
14:19:40 <Tzarly> I mean |||
14:19:47 <aristid> Twey: i mean wtf
14:19:49 <lll> !one1
14:19:55 <aristid> gn
14:19:57 <illissius-> there are two kinds of systems which work: everything in the module is in scope, or only previously-declared things are in scope but you can have forward references
14:20:00 <aristid> Tzarly: you are Twey
14:20:00 <shapr> chrisdone: What's your debug function for blazehtml? How do you print out stuff?
14:20:06 <illissius-> top-level template haskell splices give you the worst of both worlds :(
14:20:08 <jmcarthur> cantropy: when aristid says not all monads are applicatives, he means that the base library doesn't force it. but all monads are theoretically applicatives
14:20:10 <cads> are there any webservers or web frameworks that use ghci as an administrative console?
14:20:31 <cantropy> hmmm, I am kind of very new to Haskell, so will have more questions another time. but it sounds very interesting and empowering
14:20:36 <Tzarly> aristid: sure I'll go with that. What's expected of Twey?
14:20:39 <shapr> cads: Only thing I've heard of along those lines is ghci-on-acid that integrates lambdabot.
14:20:56 <aristid> Tzarly: well, tab completion...
14:20:57 <aavogt> cads: does it really make sense to link the ghc-api into your webserver for that?
14:21:02 <jmcarthur> cantropy: do feel free to hang out here as you learn, whether it be on the web client or a real client
14:21:22 <cantropy> so, what is the text book one line definition for an applicative?
14:22:05 <cads> aavogt: in ruby on rails it's easy to use the DSLs to do stuff with your website directly from irb, which is kind of neat
14:22:09 <shapr> Aha, I want renderHtml
14:22:21 <cantropy> jmcarthur: Thanks! This is very inviting.
14:22:27 <jmcarthur> cantropy: An Applicative allows you to associate side-effects with functions and with values, and those side-effects are combined as you apply the functions to the values... in a very general nutshell
14:22:55 <jmcarthur> cantropy: You are also allowed to combine something with side-effects with something with no side-effects.
14:23:10 <aavogt> @type (<*>)
14:23:11 <ddarius> aavogt: I would say that it is an extremely bad idea.
14:23:11 <zygotron> forall (f :: * -> *) a b. (Applicative f) => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

14:24:17 <aristid> jmcarthur: how are they defined there?
14:24:30 <dlyons> what types of things are written in haskell?
14:24:35 <jmcarthur> aristid: check out the paper Applicative Programming with Effects. i think it's explained there
14:24:40 <ddarius> aristid: Lax monoidal functors.
14:24:46 <Tzarly> Let's throw some big words together to illicit responses from those who think it means something: Thought exercise --> Parallel programming through the use of circuitry dedicated to cellular automata. Programming exercise: program the cellular automata.
14:24:49 <chrisdone> dlyons: you can see a good range by checking out the package list
14:24:54 <shapr> dlyons: Lots of goodies, are you interested in any particular type of applications?

14:26:34 <chrisdone> my favourite application of haskell is getting a job
14:26:52 <jmcarthur> shapr: to be fair, despite that i am actually making a game in haskell, i don't think haskell is a *great* language for games in practical terms (GHC problems, mainly)

14:28:01 <jmcarthur> jeffhill: you can actually write the bindings in haskell itself, for the most part
14:28:04 <shapr> jmcarthur: Ah, how could it be improved?
14:28:08 <Phyx-> jeffhill: openGL yes, directX doubt it
14:28:12 <Tzarly> Your the reason I'm here chrisdone
14:28:14 <hpc> binding to C++ libraries involves a C wrapper
14:28:19 <jmcarthur> shapr: we really just need a real time or soft real time garbage collector
14:28:35 <shapr> jmcarthur: Lots of work to put in one?
14:28:44 <jmcarthur> yeah, lots of work :\
14:29:12 <jmcarthur> shapr: i think RyanT5000 has actually been thinking about paying somebody to implement it though
14:29:19 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: so what are you doing? writing "tight loops" and scripting with haskell?
14:29:24 <ddarius> aristid: A strict monoidal functor would be a functor where f(a⊗b) = f(a)⊗f(b) and similarly for I, and the ⊗ may be different on each side.  A lax one is where you only have f(a)⊗f(b) -> f(a⊗b) and similarly for I.
14:29:38 <ddarius> And yes, they are strong as well, as all functors are strong in Haskell.
14:29:57 <jeffhill> Another naieve question: Isn't the Haskell garbage collector generational?  Lua's GC isn't even close to realtime, but it usually doesn't matter because of the generation optimizations.
14:29:58 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: well, no. i'm mostly heard about GC problems from other people making games. mine isn't going to be all that tight, so i don't foresee the GC getting in my way
14:30:01 <cantropy> jmcarthur: don't other environments like Lua have similar issues with GC?
14:30:12 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: ah, ok
14:30:20 <jmcarthur> cantropy: you typically don't write entire games in lua, and when you do you aren't writing crysis
14:30:25 <chrisdone> jmcarthur: if someone's thinking of paying someone to implement it, maybe we could chip in
14:30:28 <dons> jeffhill: its a parallel generational collector.
14:30:29 <zygoloid> jeffhill: GHC's garbage collector is generational.
14:30:29 <jmcarthur> cantropy: i'm talking about fairly hardware intensive games here
14:30:55 <ddarius> aristid: So, you can make an Applicative interface with a liftA0 :: () -> f () and a liftA2 :: (f a, f b) -> f (a, b) plus Functor.
14:30:59 <jmcarthur> cantropy: because haskell is actually quite fast for most purposes, so one might expect that it would be good for somewhat high-performance games too, but that is unfortunately not yet the case
14:31:12 <Jafet> But who would you pay?
14:31:30 <zygoloid> jeffhill: (unlike with lua, python or perl, there's no language implementation called haskell)
14:31:35 <jmcarthur> chrisdone: i would indeed put forward some money to have that added, assuming i have any to spare if somebody proposes to do it
14:31:53 <aristid> ddarius: liftA0 = pure?
14:31:56 <cantropy> jmacarthur: don't do much gaming, but do you mean this crysis: http://www.ea.com/games/crysis
14:31:58 <zygotron> Title: Crysis - PC Online Computer Game - EA Games
14:32:01 <danderson> dons: yes
14:32:02 <jmcarthur> Jafet: there's always well typed or something
14:32:12 <ddarius> aristid: Restricted to () yes.  Obviously not in general.
14:32:13 <jeffhill> zygoloid: I understand ghc is sort of the "standard" Haskell.  Is that naieve?
14:32:25 <danderson> dons: paste me links to binaries in private as soon as you have them, ideally before pushing them out to the world
14:32:30 <jmcarthur> jeffhill: it is the most popular haskell compiler and is the chosen compiler for the haskell platform
14:32:40 <danderson> so I can replicate them with decent bandwidth, before the slashdotting settles in :)
14:32:40 <chrisdone> jeffhill: GHC is the de facto standard implementation
14:32:54 <aristid> ddarius: it is not restricted to () in haskell's Applicative
14:33:10 <Tzarly> std::for_each(coll_, coll_ + 4, (retVar += _1 * (1L << (n++ * 16))))
14:33:12 <jmcarthur> cantropy: let's just put it this way: crysis is a very pretty slide show ;)
14:33:14 <Tzarly> foldl' ((+) . (*65536)) 0 [word1, word2, word3, word4]
14:33:30 <ddarius> aristid: I know.  liftA0 is a special case of pure.  It is not pure in general.  It is, however, all you need plus liftA2 and fmap.
14:33:34 <msieradzki> XNA uses GC :)
14:33:49 <tibbe> danderson: evening :)
14:33:50 <aristid> ddarius: "roll your own pure with liftA0 and fmap"?
14:33:51 <dons> danderson: i would like the torrents up 24 hrs before the actual release
14:33:51 <msieradzki> the default way to use memory in games is to allocate everything before the game starts
14:33:58 <ddarius> :t let liftA0 :: Functor f => () -> f (); liftA0 = undefined; pure = fmap . const in pure
14:33:59 <zygotron> forall a (f :: * -> *) a1. (Functor f) => a -> f a1 -> f a
14:33:59 <tibbe> danderson: it seems like you've turned into a regular ;)
14:34:00 <jmcarthur> msieradzki: presumably either a better GC than ours or to run simpler games than i'm talking about
14:34:03 <jmcarthur> msieradzki: right
14:34:14 <jmcarthur> but that defeats some of the purpose of using haskell :(
14:34:23 <jmcarthur> cantropy: http://www.gossipgamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/reallifecrysis-2.jpg
14:34:24 <zygotron> http://tinyurl.com/3575uwx
14:34:25 <ddarius> :t let liftA0 :: Functor f => () -> f (); liftA0 = undefined; pure a = fmap (const a) (liftA0 ()) in pure
14:34:26 <zygotron> forall a (f :: * -> *). (Functor f) => a -> f a
14:34:27 <msieradzki> for instance x360 has 512MB shared RAM but the assumption is that only 1MB of RAM will be checked during GC
14:34:41 <msieradzki> (when using XNA to program for it)
14:34:42 <dons> danderson: but i will need sign-off from the developers first.
14:34:46 <jmcarthur> wow
14:34:47 <danderson> dons: fine by me; I work PST-ish hours nowadays, so we should be able to connect.
14:34:48 <sm> it sounded like RyanT5000 has a trick - farm the work out to worker threads, or c ?
14:34:50 <jeffhill> msieradzki: That's certainly true for static assets, where possible, but all the game I've worked on have had non-trivial dynamic memory allocation in gameplay code.
14:34:54 <dons> danderson: oh great.
14:34:57 <jmcarthur> sm: c
14:35:03 <sm> ah
14:35:11 <danderson> tibbe: I've been lurking for a while now, yeah :)
14:35:22 <msieradzki> jeffhill, PC or memory limited consoles? :)
14:35:27 <tibbe> dons: There's crazy many things going on in the Haskell community right now. Earlier today I worked on the I/O manager, talked to my GSoC student about Cabal test support and now I'm finishing the new Haddock theme with Mark.
14:35:31 <tibbe> danderson: :)
14:35:52 <lispy> tibbe: yeah, Haskell for the win!
14:35:53 <sm> tibbe++ !
14:36:02 <bictormaskell> )^qqu
14:36:08 <jmcarthur> jeffhill: most AAA games preallocate buffers and then manually add and remove objects from those, rarely or never touching malloc
14:36:12 <cantropy> jmacarthur: interesting.
14:36:23 <bictormaskell> how many noses do slugs have?
14:36:28 <tibbe> dons: and the hopefully some containers work this summer
14:36:37 <bictormaskell> the answer is four
14:36:43 <Tzarly> jmcarthur. come again...
14:37:04 <illissius-> jmcarthur: are you sure real time / soft real time is what we need from the GC? I'd think what would really help would be if it were concurrent (as opposed to stop-the-world)
14:37:11 <jeffhill> msieradzki: Both.  You typically avoid malloc completely, but custom pooled allocators and such are still dynamic memory allocation, especially if they live beyond a frame.
14:37:13 <Tzarly> Oh! got it - where's the fun in that!
14:37:19 <illissius-> for example Apple's AutoZone GC is like that iirc (using write barriers or somesuch)
14:37:25 <jmcarthur> illissius-: i would say it's soft real time if it's not stop the world
14:37:58 <ddarius> "concurrent" and "real-time" are usually considered, at least, close synonyms in GC literature
14:37:59 <illissius-> oh ok
14:38:03 <jmcarthur> concurrent or incremental would both be okay
14:38:07 <illissius-> yeah i guess that makes sense
14:38:18 <Nick_> Hey people? 
14:38:37 <jmcarthur> hey Nick_?
14:38:55 <Tzarly> Cheers nick
14:39:00 <illissius-> concurrency does seem like both a necessary and sufficient condition for soft-real-timeness, or at least close to it
14:39:10 <digitalacetone> hello redditors
14:39:11 <Tzarly> Welcome Guest99191
14:39:21 <Guest99191> Waa. What happpend :S 
14:39:22 <Tzarly> hi digitalacetone
14:39:25 <cantropy> getting back to trying Haskell
14:40:22 <Tzarly> reddit tzarly ==> 2 results in .32 seconds
14:40:48 <enc> so confused
14:41:03 <enc> on a tiny little net book... and this page is much to large :)
14:41:11 <monochrom> haha
14:41:44 <ezyang> I want to create a typeclass which supports functions IO a -> NT n a and IO a -> NTQ n a (where n is a phantom type). Should the type class be NTMonad n m or just NTMonad m? 
14:42:09 <aristid> digitalacetone: it's OK for you if not everybody here is a redditor? :P
14:42:19 <digitalacetone> lol
14:42:21 <digitalacetone> well yes
14:42:24 <Tzarly> Your question makes the second one seem the better option
14:42:39 <digitalacetone> i'd like to know how your script guessed my age out of 12, 12, 32
14:42:47 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: the vast majority of users here are actually not here as a direct result of reddit ;)
14:42:50 <Saizan> ezyang: depends on if you want instances to be able to specialize the 'n' parameter
14:42:55 <alex_kidd_> I'm using readFile to read a file, then I'm using (from Parsec v2.1) many anyChar to get a list of chars. However, the list is far smaller than the file. Is this because readFile is lazy?
14:43:01 <Tzarly> Damn redditors! Why couldn't we get the digg people!?
14:43:06 <jmcarthur> ugh no
14:43:22 <digitalacetone> jmcarthur: give it another 15 min
14:43:24 <aristid> how about the haskell-cafe people
14:43:29 <aristid> oh wait, they are already here
14:43:31 <aristid> haha :P
14:43:54 <monochrom> alex_kidd_: many anyChar should end up slurping the whole file
14:43:55 <dafis> alex_kidd_: probably
14:44:02 <digitalacetone> can i download this haskell and adapt it to my own needs?
14:44:10 <Saizan> alex_kidd_: readFile should always read the whole file eventually
14:44:18 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: yes!
14:44:23 <digitalacetone> nice
14:44:30 <digitalacetone> that sounds like my new project
14:44:31 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/
14:44:31 <Saizan> alex_kidd_: if you demand all of it, i mean
14:44:32 <zygotron> Title: Download Haskell
14:44:34 <digitalacetone> quite awesome
14:45:02 <digitalacetone> what about this, do i need a dedicated server for this?
14:45:08 <digitalacetone> or can I use shared hosting env?
14:45:08 <alex_kidd_> i'll try to get a simple form of it pasted
14:45:10 <digitalacetone> to host this
14:45:13 <jmcarthur> oh, you are wanting to have your own tryhaskell?
14:45:15 <monochrom> parsec's many anyChar demands absolutely everything
14:45:17 <fxr> throwErr e = Iteratee $ λ_ on_cont → on_cont (λ_ → throwErr e) (Just e) isnt it a bottom?
14:45:28 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: what i linked you to is the standalone interpreter, compiler, and standard libraries
14:46:00 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: if you install what i linked you to then you can run `ghci' at the command line and get something similar to the prompt at tryhaskell.org
14:46:12 <jmcarthur> but more powerful and less flaky :)
14:46:34 <aristid> it even allows I/O
14:46:38 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: also, you can check out these tutorials to learn more than tryhaskell.org can teach you:
14:46:40 <jmcarthur> @lyah
14:46:40 <zygotron> Unknown command, try @list
14:46:42 <jmcarthur> @rwh
14:46:43 <zygotron> Maybe you meant: rc run wn
14:46:45 <jmcarthur> oops
14:46:47 <jmcarthur> @where lyah
14:46:48 <zygotron> www.learnyouahaskell.com
14:46:51 <jmcarthur> @where rwh
14:46:51 <zygotron> is http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/
14:46:54 <digitalacetone> i always liked the command line
14:47:21 <fxr> hmm if I step forever... cool oleg.
14:47:42 <aristid> digitalacetone: "the command line" doesn't mean anything
14:47:51 <aristid> there are many different terminal emulators and shells
14:48:06 <jmcarthur> aristid: i first used that term in this conversation
14:48:10 <jmcarthur> i was just trying to be simple
14:48:13 <digitalacetone> what i mean is typing input
14:48:15 <mauke> aristid: I disagree
14:48:47 <aristid> digitalacetone: like on tryhaskell? :)
14:48:48 <fxr> IterateeMCPS is f...ing awesome.
14:48:49 <monochrom> "the command line" means vt100
14:49:01 <jmcarthur> anyway, i'm leaving work now
14:49:15 <digitalacetone> what i would like to know is how my age was computed out of 12, 12, 32
14:49:15 <aristid> mauke: why do you disagree?
14:49:27 <Jafet> That's a terminal, not a command line.
14:49:32 <digitalacetone> or is this a coincidence?
14:49:47 <mauke> because "the command line" means something
14:49:48 <aristid> digitalacetone: if you ask this question, then you're probably 12, because it's a child-like question
14:49:48 <jmcarthur> chrisdone++
14:49:50 <jmcarthur> big success
14:50:05 <aristid> mauke: what?
14:50:20 <Tzarly> I'm with aristid. what?
14:50:28 <alex_kidd_> does many anyChar terminate on an end of file token? because my file is not made up of characters
14:50:33 <jmcarthur> oh don't be hard on him
14:50:54 <monochrom> no, many anyChar does not terminate on an end of file token.
14:51:01 <mauke> alex_kidd_: there are no end-of-file tokens
14:51:02 <digitalacetone> aristid: how is that a child-like question?
14:51:28 <Tzarly> http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html Neal Stephenson's - In the beginning there was the command line
14:51:28 <zygotron> Title: C R Y P T O N O M I C O N
14:51:48 <aristid> digitalacetone: dunno, it just feels like one. no offense, please
14:52:22 <Tzarly> It made me want to try the BEOS the first time I read it
14:52:29 <Tzarly> or should I say reddit
14:52:29 <aristid> alex_kidd_: many anyChar only accepts characters, in any case. many anyChar :: (Stream s m Char) => ParsecT s u m [Char]
14:52:50 <mauke> alex_kidd_: why are you using parsec?
14:53:17 <monochrom> if you are on stupid Microsoft Diskette Operating System, maybe readFile terminates on U+001A.
14:53:58 <digitalacetone> aristid: why don't you produce an adult-like answer then? no offense
14:54:14 <alex_kidd_> I don't know really, I just wanted to see how easy it would be to parse a certain file format (DICOM) with it. Seems like it will be easier to roll my own parsing monad
14:54:16 <aristid> digitalacetone: because i'm quite immature :)
14:54:46 <Tzarly> It's not fair to say something offensive and then append it with "no offense"
14:55:04 <digitalacetone> I agree
14:55:18 * ddarius goes and becomes slightly more productive.
14:55:23 <Phyx-> monochrom: you're mean
14:55:27 <Tzarly> At least no-one's *on* the fence
14:55:38 <Phyx-> what did Microsoft Diskette Operating System ever do to you
14:55:50 <mauke> http://mauke.ath.cx/exe/jslinenc?dustin+is+the+coolest
14:55:52 <Tzarly> disk 18: read error
14:56:03 <IceDane> How would I go about removing all commas from a string?
14:56:06 <Tzarly> Please start again...
14:56:16 <mauke> IceDane: filter (',' /=)
14:56:17 <IceDane> I haven't written haskell for a couple of months and again, I'm rusty like s***
14:56:18 <aristid> digitalacetone: see, if i say "no offense, please", then you may or may not be offended. i'm just asking you not to.
14:56:18 <monochrom> it introduced this stupid "ctrl-z ends the file" convention and confused people
14:56:26 <IceDane> mauke: Thanks a lot
14:56:38 <monochrom> ok, to be fair, maybe cp/m introduced it
14:56:48 <Tzarly> I'm suddenly reminded of pulp fiction. I don't know why
15:00:08 <Tzarly> No, no, no. You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me. So you can go ahead and ask me what you're going to ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended! Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.
15:00:20 <Tzarly> - Mia Wallace
15:00:50 <monochrom> You could easily summarize that as: this sentence is false.
15:03:47 <winxordie> You could easily summarize that as: this sentence is self-referential; goodbye intuition!
15:03:50 <ice_slice> Pardon my ignorance but is Haskell as distributed programming language?
15:04:01 <ice_slice> *as->a
15:04:13 <aristid> ice_slice: what do you mean by "distributed"?
15:04:35 <ice_slice> It is very easy to run a Haskell program over multiple machines.
15:04:42 <ice_slice> I know they have distributed jvm's for Java.
15:04:43 <Tzarly> Could someone provide a link to a good coding standard for Haskell?
15:04:50 <mauke> ice_slice: I wouldn't say so
15:05:27 <lispy> What about data parallel Haskell?  Would that count?
15:05:29 <monochrom> there was a time it was. then the distributed part got bitrot. one day it will be resurrected.
15:05:46 <ice_slice> Each language seems to have its purposes, c/c++ for embedded, java for larger development applications, jsps/asp etc for web.... What would Haskell be good for? Scalability?
15:06:19 <aristid> ice_slice: c/c++ is not one but two languages, thank you very much
15:06:22 <winxordie> ice_slice: you just claimed that general-purpose languages have specific purposes
15:06:33 <yumyum> reddit :|
15:06:39 <yumyum> that is all
15:06:40 <ice_slice> They tend to take up a specific purpose or atleast are used more in a specific area.
15:06:41 <mauke> since when is asp a programming language?
15:06:41 <Veinor> winxordie: well, I wouldn't write a video game in ASP
15:06:43 <monochrom> haskell seems to be good for ruling the world
15:06:51 <Veinor> and I wouldn't write twitter in C
15:06:56 <Tzarly> I think he means their _suited_ to specific purposes...
15:07:04 <aristid> Veinor: not even embedded twitter?
15:07:08 <winxordie> Veinor: I wouldn't call ASP a language. (er, general-purpose lang... hehe)
15:07:16 <Veinor> well, you know what I meant :P
15:07:20 <ice_slice> I am just curious, Why should I be interested in Haskell, what is it better at than most other languages?
15:07:34 <Jafet> I think twitter might as well already be written in C
15:07:34 <ice_slice> What would I use Haskell for that I wouldn't do in Java?
15:07:39 <monochrom> abstractions, refactoring
15:07:40 <chrisdone> ice_slice: giving you confidence in the safety and correctness of your software
15:07:42 <Jafet> They even have a built-in size limit
15:07:49 <monochrom> I mean refactored programs
15:07:53 <Tzarly> ice_slice: this the chat room. Advertising's back on the home page
15:08:09 <Veinor> Tzarly: we don't mind advertising in here :D
15:08:29 <Tzarly> ice_slice: you've hit the tech division, you're looking for marketing :)
15:08:42 <ice_slice> I was just curious. It seems that we can find so many languages today that say "use me" but I was just wondering what Haskell would be good for in, lets say, to Java. From a technical standpoint.
15:08:43 <aristid> ice_slice: in java you need 50 lines for what haskell can do in one line. that saves a lot of effort.
15:08:45 <Jafet> ice_slice: we're not you -- how could we ever answer that?
15:08:55 <ice_slice> *in comparsion to
15:08:55 <winxordie> ice_slice: I heavily encourage you to read this verified, full net-neutral authoritative summary to make all conclusions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)
15:09:04 <Jafet> If you want an answer, learn Haskell and ask yourself afterwards.
15:09:11 <ice_slice> Thanks aristid.
15:09:46 <Tzarly> aristid --> ice_slice: it means less scrolling for code that takes the same time to comprehend.
15:09:51 <ice_slice> I have found that the majority of interesting things that come out of a unique are related to complex situations, just learning the basics of a language does not always show its power.
15:10:02 <ice_slice> So Haskell is even more High-Level than Java?
15:10:09 <hpc> yes
15:10:12 <aristid> ice_slice: yes, haskell is more high-level than java
15:10:13 <dobblego> yes, way more
15:10:19 <winxordie> Tzarly: isn't that the claim behind Perl/APL one-liners? :P
15:10:44 <Tzarly> ice_slice: "just learning the basics of a language does not always show its power." I disagree
15:10:50 <ice_slice> Is it platform independent? Does the high-level nature translate into a great deal of performance loss or were they ' the creators' able to make it high-level without a great deal of loss?
15:10:58 <aristid> winxordie: APL is one a whole different league of terseness than Perl. in fact, i think often Haskell is much terser than Perl (not always though)
15:11:03 <Tzarly> winxordie: I believe it is.
15:11:11 <ice_slice> How does it compare to Python, more high level?
15:11:22 <dobblego> ice_slice, way higher than python
15:11:29 <aristid> ice_slice: ghc (the most popular haskell compiler) is quite fast
15:11:33 <Veinor> ice_slice: haskell is a compiled language, so it's pretty fast
15:11:41 <Tzarly> aristid: terse != measure_of_quality
15:11:48 <mauke> ice_slice: haskell is an interpreted language, so it's pretty slow
15:11:49 <Jafet> Bah, this is even more offtopic than the usual haskell vs c++
15:11:49 <dobblego> ice_slice, as for performance, Java is not platform independent and Haskell often beats it with performance
15:11:52 <Veinor> also laziness and lack of side effects lets the compiler perform a lot of optimizations and such
15:11:55 <winxordie> aristid: yeah, I know - I dabbled in APL for a while
15:11:56 <Veinor> mauke: :|
15:11:56 <aristid> Tzarly: i know, but it's crude things that attract people.
15:12:14 <mauke> Veinor: languages are languages
15:12:23 <Veinor> haskell is almost always compiled
15:12:30 <aristid> not always though, Veinor
15:12:35 <mauke> Veinor: not if you're a hugs user
15:12:36 <Tzarly> aristid: agreed.
15:12:39 <monochrom> Jafet: this is even more high-level than the usual haskell vs c++ XD
15:12:39 <ice_slice> Is it used in any commercial applications?  How does it do in scalability.... such as like a http sever or ftp server or something with a lot of users accessing data.
15:12:40 <Veinor> true.
15:12:41 <winxordie> So I herd I entered #haskell-nubs
15:12:50 <winxordie> *hoping channel exists*
15:12:54 <dobblego> ice_slice, I am employed as a Java programmer and I will write Haskell all day today 
15:12:56 <pragmascript> hai
15:13:02 <sm> ice_slice: haskell reduces development cost and maintenance cost over most other languages, other things being equal
15:13:52 <sm> and tends to encourage clearer design
15:14:04 <fxr> is it possible to put a timestamp on ghci prompt?
15:14:05 <msieradzki> and brain pain
15:14:16 <aristid> and boredness
15:14:23 <Tzarly> ice_slice: I think it unfair to look at software developed in the past on the hardware of the past with the mindset of the past for a question whose crux relates to *future* development?
15:14:31 <fxr> so that I can see which command given in which minute?
15:14:43 <ice_slice> Which is why I asked about distributed features and scalability.
15:14:49 <ice_slice> With the cloud coming....
15:14:52 <aristid> fxr: i would like to know that too
15:14:59 <ice_slice> I was jsut curious how it would work on a disitributed system like the cloud.
15:15:07 <winxordie> it's actually clear evening here
15:15:22 <Tzarly> ice_slice: oh...
15:15:23 <fxr> we're working two ppl in the same screen and sometimes communicating each other on gchi prompt 
15:15:39 <fxr> (no I'm not a schizophrenic)
15:15:41 <pragmascript> stupid question: is there a haskell compiler for .net
15:15:49 <ice_slice> I was just curious,... when it comes to writing applications for the Cloud, a distributed set of computers, what language would be best?
15:15:58 <dobblego> ice_slice, Haskell or Erlang
15:16:00 <benc___> totally depends on your app
15:16:10 <msieradzki> what applications
15:16:12 <ice_slice> I heard that Haskell is very good at paralleism. 
15:16:22 <msieradzki> probably your own or one that scales automatically like DryadLINQ
15:16:34 <Tzarly> whatever happened to Ajax
15:16:51 <Tzarly> Why don't hear as much about silverlight these days
15:17:01 <Tzarly> or moonlight... something like that
15:17:10 <Veinor> AJAX is good, silverlight will never catch on
15:17:13 <msieradzki> because html5 has higher chances
15:17:13 <steveklabnik> because it's from microsoft
15:17:20 <dobblego> ice_slice, there are some fundamental properties of Haskell that mean things like "parallelism works well", "correctness improves", "maintenance improves" -- I recommend understanding these fundamentals (by learning the language), so then these conclusions become quite apparent
15:17:45 <Tzarly> <don't hate the game - blame balmer>
15:17:45 <Phyx-> steveklabnik: that's a rather stupid statement
15:18:01 <ice_slice> Is the learning curve much lower for Haskell than other high-level languages?
15:18:08 <steveklabnik> Phyx-: I'm just saying. that's why I never hear about it anyway. I'm far too in the other camp to ever hear anything about it.
15:18:14 <winxordie> ice_slice: not really
15:18:22 <winxordie> most likely to be higher
15:18:27 <winxordie> depends on the language
15:18:28 <dobblego> ice_slice, no, it has a learning curve, especially if you're an existing programmer 
15:18:54 <dobblego> ice_slice, these are the prices we pay (we have to learn) to achieve the aforementioned benefits
15:19:00 <Tzarly> dobblego. Sounds to me like some unlearning needs to take place?
15:19:05 <ice_slice> One thing I like about Java is their extensive documentation and somewhat extensive set of tools/packages, is this true for Haskell?
15:19:06 <winxordie> it's definitely easier than Malbolge though
15:19:32 <Emylbus> oooh i like this tryhaskel.org thing
15:19:34 <dobblego> Tzarly, prexactly -- I am employed for 1/2 day/week doing that
15:19:47 <dobblego> ice_slice, Java's libraries are actually quite poor
15:19:56 <dobblego> I should know, I wrote some of them, haha :)
15:19:57 <Tzarly> dobblego. Nice job if you can get it?
15:20:17 <dobblego> Tzarly, it's easy -- just get employed anywhere, teach them how they are doing it wrong, then they ask for more
15:20:20 <ice_slice> What are some disadvantages of Haskell?
15:20:32 <dobblego> Tzarly, I am employed specifically because of my thorough knowledge of Java
15:20:39 <Tzarly> :-o
15:20:45 <Tzarly> that was unexpected
15:20:54 <monochrom> Disadvantage of Haskell: its name is not catchy
15:20:56 * BMeph is amused that Silverlight won't run on his Vista machine at home...
15:21:13 <dobblego> Tzarly, I used to work on the Java implementation and still contribute somewhat to the language
15:21:15 <monochrom> Disadvantage of Haskell: requires a brain
15:21:16 <chrisdone> ice_slice: getting other people to learn it
15:21:25 <pragmascript> is there a haskell compiler for .net?
15:21:28 <steveklabnik> ice_slice: if you have a long history of doing things in an imperative manner, it's really hard to wrap your head around the functional ways of doing things. at some point it sort of clicks
15:21:35 <chrisdone> there's a bridge to .NET, but not a compiler
15:21:36 <steveklabnik> pragmascript: F# ;) I kiiid.
15:21:45 <winxordie> I think we've got specialists in #haskell-survey-questions that have these answers memorised
15:21:51 <pragmascript> F# hehe
15:22:05 <Tzarly> Besides the Garbage Collector, Java never impressed. The swing lib made everything else seem slow to me. But a lot co's swear by it
15:22:22 <dobblego> Tzarly, it's far worse than many Java users realise
15:22:40 <Phyx-> chrisdone: it've never actually seen code for that .NET bridge
15:22:59 <zoheb> Is there any better way of writing this code , input is a BufferedReader
15:23:02 <zoheb>       var concept = input.readLine        while (concept != null) {         println         nestedConcept = input.readLine       }
15:23:03 <Phyx-> chrisdone: if you're refering to http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~haskell/haskelldotnet/
15:23:05 <zygotron> Title: The Haskell.NET Project
15:23:20 <zoheb> foreach or smthng
15:23:23 <Tzarly> At the time I was also quite impressed by NetBeans IDE There was nothing else free that remotely compared to what it could do < or so I thought >
15:23:27 <Phyx-> The way I use it just compile haskell to a shared lib
15:23:28 <lispy> zoheb: I don't think that's valid haskell
15:23:31 <Phyx-> and load that in .NET
15:23:31 <dobblego> zoheb, wrong channel?
15:23:38 <zoheb> Ouch wriong channel
15:23:43 <chrisdone> Phyx-: on hackage
15:23:45 <zoheb> I thought I was in scala
15:23:55 <zoheb> bye guys
15:24:04 <Tzarly> ice_slice: finding Haskell developers. Ask chrisdone
15:24:05 <pragmascript> yes this haskell.net project is looking pretty dead
15:24:32 <ice_slice> What is wrong with saying sort "andrew"
15:24:36 <ice_slice> I got a Terminated!
15:24:41 <lispy> There is at least one Haskell <--> .NET bridge that is still alive
15:24:47 <Phyx-> chrisdone: hm ok
15:24:49 <chrisdone> ice_slice: try again
15:24:49 <lispy> IIRC, written by sigbjorn
15:24:54 <dafis> > sort "andrew"
15:24:55 <zygotron>   "adenrw"
15:25:06 <ice_slice> oh odd, It failed initially but now works.
15:25:09 <Phyx-> lispy: how does he accomplish that if you know
15:25:10 <pragmascript> hmm is this bridge using llvm
15:25:23 <monochrom> sort "andrew" works for me.
15:25:30 <lispy> Phyx-: FFI I'm pretty sure
15:25:31 <ice_slice> Works for me now too, just failed the first time.
15:25:45 <lispy> Phyx-: Probably Windows only
15:25:47 <Phyx-> lispy: what makes it .NET specific then?
15:25:47 <monochrom> keep trying. "terminated" may mean server overloaded
15:25:51 <BMeph> Isn't Erik Meijer the bridge between Haskell and .NET? ;)
15:26:00 <ice_slice> I must say, it is a brilliant idea to have the interpreter running with lessons under it and a chat window next to it.
15:26:01 <lispy> BMeph: hehe
15:26:10 <lispy> Phyx-: Lets you call from Haskell into .NET
15:26:16 <dobblego> we watch Erik Meijer's video series at work each day too -- we will win!
15:26:16 <Tzarly> lol BMeph
15:26:17 <chrisdone> ice_slice: the simple explanation is lots of users are talking to it simultaneously, that can increase the load a bit, and some expressions get killed unfairly
15:26:28 <lispy> Phyx-: I assume it defines the necessary types to be able to marshal
15:26:32 <monochrom> actually I can't find the chat window.
15:27:01 <Tzarly> chrisdone: the servers are linked?
15:27:02 <chrisdone> ice_slice: basically it's a tricky art to kill evaluations before they use too much CPU/memory, so it's a little bit eager
15:27:02 <Phyx-> lispy: ah, well I do that aswell, I should probably check out how he does the marshalling. I still have blindlingly slow marshalling code
15:27:14 <ice_slice> yeah that is true.
15:27:18 <mm_freak> if anyone cares, i've written a little rock/paper/scissors server in haskell: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27905
15:27:23 <mm_freak> have fun =)
15:27:32 <lispy> Phyx-: Well, if you're doing out of process COM to marshal to .NET it will be insanely slow
15:27:38 <monochrom> perhaps because I block popups
15:27:45 <Tzarly> mm_freak: why not...
15:27:55 <ice_slice> That sever code looks quite trivial.
15:27:58 <pragmascript> what IDE are you guys using
15:28:03 <ice_slice> Compared to what it could be in other languages.
15:28:07 <lispy> pragmascript: emacs
15:28:13 <pragmascript> of course :)
15:28:13 * Veinor uses emacs too
15:28:16 <ice_slice> Is there a plugin for Haskell in Eclipse?
15:28:17 <chrisdone> ice_slice: yeah there's no security issues to deal with, just time and space
15:28:23 <mm_freak> ice_slice: nevertheless it's a fully concurrent, multithreading game server =)
15:28:23 <olsner> mm_freak: make it polymorphic so it can also play rock paper scissor lizard spock!
15:28:24 <Veinor> emacs, hoogle, and a running ghci session in a terminal
15:28:25 <Phyx-> lispy: i'm compiling haskell to a native shared lib, loading that shared lib into memory and calling it, only the haskell side has to marshall, there's no unmarshalling on the .NET side
15:28:26 <lispy> pragmascript: vim is another good choice.  You could get brave and try leksah or yi
15:28:27 <chrisdone> there is an eclipse plugin, yes
15:28:37 <ice_slice> Is that sever, blocking or non-blocking IO?
15:28:39 <lispy> ice_slice: yeah, eclipse-fp
15:28:39 <Tzarly> mm_freak: why not use a ring data structure to store the 3 possibilities :)
15:28:43 <Phyx-> lispy: I suspect it's the mallocs on the haskell side that are slow
15:28:55 <Phyx-> but I can't prove that untill I get my profiler working
15:29:10 <ice_slice> How does memory collection work? Is there a garbage collector or does one have to self manage memory?
15:29:15 <mm_freak> i guess, i could make a ComparisonGame class =)
15:29:16 <Veinor> there's a GC.
15:29:40 <mm_freak> actually, i can use the Ord class
15:29:43 <ice_slice> How does its effectiveness compare to Java? I know IN java if you are losing objects too fast and too many the GC can totally stop your program for 5-30 seconds.
15:29:43 <mm_freak> fancy
15:29:46 <fxr> there are gcs
15:29:55 <lispy> ice_slice: the default is GC but the libraries provide references that you can manage manually if you like
15:30:09 <ice_slice> Oh that is nice. I always hated in Java how you cannot override the GC.
15:30:21 <ice_slice> In some specific instances its nice to control your own memory.
15:30:29 <chrisdone> i'm off to bed. ciao
15:30:37 <ice_slice> night
15:30:38 <Ryan____> This is dumb
15:30:43 <Ryan____> waht is this
15:30:46 <lispy> yeah, once in a while.  Usually in Haskell if you're having memory issues you control the evaluation and the data representation first.
15:30:56 <Ryan____> what is the whole point of this website?
15:31:02 <olsner> mm_freak: that'd be a little bit weird though, doesn't Ord imply reflexivity?
15:31:08 <chrisdone> Ryan____: if you have to ask, you can't afford it
15:31:10 <Ryan____> does this block swearing? ass. 
15:31:11 <Ryan____> nope
15:31:16 <Ryan____> this is so stupid
15:31:19 <Ryan____> why would someone want this
15:31:25 <Tzarly> ring buffer (#. rock paper scissor #.) : winTest if answer == (left of (match answer to datastructure)) win else lose
15:31:26 <monochrom> I haven't seen my program stopped for 5 seconds, even when it creates and loses data faster than any normal java program
15:31:27 <Ryan____> if all you do is type in math equations
15:31:34 <mm_freak> olsner: in what sense?
15:31:34 <winxordie> Ryan____: I ask the same thing of the chans myself
15:31:41 <Ryan____> k this is dumb bye
15:31:47 <mm_freak> Tzarly: i, now i get what you mean
15:31:51 <ice_slice> Would you guys recommend college students be taught Haskell over Java?
15:31:54 <olsner> mm_freak: mostly that it's expected from other users of Ord
15:32:01 <hpc> ice_slice: yes
15:32:02 <ice_slice> In terms of learning to program.
15:32:13 <hpc> java teaches horrible horrible habits
15:32:23 <olsner> e.g. what would/should sort [Rock,Paper,Scissor] produce?
15:32:23 <alex_kidd_> i recommend college students not learn Java
15:32:35 <mm_freak> olsner: oh, yeah
15:32:36 <mm_freak> indeed
15:32:38 <lispy> ice_slice: I think it's a false dichotomy.  Learn both and use what you like :)
15:32:39 <alex_kidd_> theres enough time for that in 'the real world' if needs be
15:33:06 <monochrom> I recommend critical thinking and systematic thinking.
15:33:08 <dobblego> ice_slice, I recommend people learn nothing over Java, with respect to gaining an understanding of programming
15:33:24 <Tomsik__> I would recommend teaching how to think, not a language
15:33:29 <a-lonely-girl> hello
15:33:29 <ice_slice> yeah.
15:33:37 <a-lonely-girl> i try haskell
15:33:39 <fxr> Tomsik__: you cannot
15:33:41 <Tomsik__> Give 'em a goddamn fishing pole, not a fish
15:33:43 <Tzarly> students should progressively be given a 8086 followed 8286 the following year... Smart ones will get to work on web server at the end of the course
15:33:44 <hpc> so far as teaching how to think goes, haskell is a great medium for that
15:33:48 <dafis> a-lonely-girl: good
15:34:04 <ice_slice> I try Haskell and I am enjoying
15:34:21 <a-lonely-girl> haskell not enjoys you
15:34:21 <ice_slice> It slightly reminds me of a mix between Java and Python. :D
15:34:25 <dafis> ice_slice: what else?
15:34:44 <ice_slice> What else dafis?
15:34:51 <dafis> ice_slice: what else but enjoying, I meant
15:35:14 <ice_slice> hehe.
15:35:45 <ice_slice> What is the need in abbreviating the function FST rather than just naming it First?
15:35:49 <Tomsik__> also, there should be "how to read a reference" courses
15:35:57 <dobblego> ice_slice, first is used in other contexts
15:36:02 <ice_slice> Oh, ok.
15:36:02 <winxordie> Tzarly: I recommend not using *that* cpu architecture at all actually.
15:36:05 <Tomsik__> ice_slice: it's an oooold thing
15:36:10 <dafis> ice_slice: Haskell is lazy, fst is less to type :)
15:36:11 <Tzarly> tomsik_ the title will be rtfm...
15:37:04 <Tomsik__> it's that people when first see a reference don't have a slightest idea what is going on
15:37:16 <a-lonely-girl> doc needs more examples
15:37:18 <Tomsik__> and not many have the eagerness to fight it
15:37:20 <a-lonely-girl> look at python docs
15:37:40 <Tzarly> When you know where your coming from and where you are now, it can give you perspective about where you want to move to. Required learning: The Marketing Myth of more GHz being better and its downfall
15:37:42 <a-lonely-girl> if examples are too long, redesign language
15:38:07 <dafis> a-lonely-girl: which doc needs more examples?
15:38:39 <Veinor> :t first
15:38:40 <zygotron> forall (a :: * -> * -> *) b c d. (Arrow a) => a b c -> a (b, d) (c, d)
15:38:48 <shapr> pretty!
15:38:51 <Veinor> clearly this is more useful than fst :D
15:39:08 <a-lonely-girl> http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/index.html
15:39:09 <zygotron> Title: Haskell Hierarchical Libraries
15:39:19 <monochrom> Huffman code teaches you to choose short names for things you expect to occur many times.
15:39:38 <Tzarly> veinor: mind you some people may associate fst with fisting
15:39:41 <ice_slice> http://i.imgur.com/qrwRq.png
15:39:50 <msieradzki> ice_slice, it's because there's no haskell visual studio
15:39:51 <Veinor> I mentally pronounce it 'fist'
15:40:04 <Veinor> and snd 'sund'
15:40:15 <ice_slice> :)
15:40:39 <ice_slice> Can Haskell be used in web-apps?
15:40:41 <ivanm> a-lonely-girl: ummm, the _index_ needs examples?
15:40:43 <ice_slice> like Java in jsps.
15:40:46 <Tzarly> ice_slice: as one who dole's out much randomness. That's pretty 0q27k random
15:40:48 <ivanm> ice_slice: yes: happstack, snap, etc.
15:42:00 <ice_slice> ;)
15:42:04 <Tzarly> The last language I came across that _couldn't_ do web-pages was BASIC
15:42:21 <monochrom> http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/containers-0.3.0.0/Data-Map.html#v%3Aalter  has more than enough examples
15:42:21 <zygotron> Title: Data.Map, http://tinyurl.com/27z652x
15:42:28 <ivanm> Tzarly: matlab, mathematica, R...
15:42:46 <ice_slice> What group created Haskell?
15:42:49 <cncl> has someone done a webserver in labview
15:42:49 <ivanm> zygotron == lambdabot in disguise?
15:42:50 <ice_slice> Who supports it
15:42:54 <ivanm> ice_slice: the Haskell committee created it
15:42:56 <Veinor> ivanm: I think so.
15:42:58 <Tzarly> Matlab can generate your reports in HTML
15:43:03 <ivanm> and it's supported by the community
15:43:18 <ivanm> Tzarly: reports yes; arbitrary web pages though?
15:43:28 <monochrom> If you mean things like http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.1/Prelude.html#v%3Ahead they're exemplified in most tutorials
15:43:29 <zygotron> Title: Prelude, http://tinyurl.com/39evvn3
15:43:30 <ice_slice> Are there any well-known apps written in Haskell?
15:43:40 <ivanm> ice_slice: darcs, xmonad
15:43:40 <Veinor> xmonad
15:43:41 <Tzarly> You didn't do too many arbitrary reports did you?
15:43:44 <cncl> xmonad, darcs :)
15:43:46 <monochrom> (indeed how many examples of "head" do you need?)
15:43:49 <lispy> and ghc
15:43:54 <a-lonely-girl> ice_slice: the cloud
15:43:57 <ivanm> lispy: well, that's not as well known...
15:43:58 <Tzarly> I can't speak to R and mathematica though
15:44:03 <winxordie> wasn't pugs written in haskell?
15:44:06 <ivanm> monochrom: LOTS!!!
15:44:08 <ivanm> winxordie: yeah
15:44:10 <jmcarthur> yes, pugs
15:44:10 <cncl> yes it was
15:44:18 <Gracenotes> GHC says: "so-and-so is used in a top-level splice or annotation, and must be imported, not defined locally"  I say "..WTF". ctrl+f time
15:44:19 <msieradzki> ivanm, well known :)
15:44:27 <ivanm> but ghc and pugs aren't as well known from an end-user point of view
15:44:31 <dobblego> mm_freak, FYI I get non-exhaustive pattern warnings on your code
15:44:39 <aristid> Gracenotes: what does ctrl+f do?
15:44:40 <digitalacetone> so simple question: what do I get out of this haskell?
15:44:51 <a-lonely-girl> fibonacci program is famous
15:44:51 <cncl> thinking different
15:44:51 <ivanm> aristid: ... search? in firefox, etc.
15:44:54 <Gracenotes> aristid: searching my code. but there's nothing unusual :(
15:44:56 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: the ability to create computer programs
15:44:59 <winxordie> digitalacetone: a great theory on combinatorial logic.
15:45:03 <lispy> digitalacetone: win
15:45:04 <Gracenotes> what the hell is splicing. I did no splicing.
15:45:04 <jmcarthur> lol
15:45:07 <a-lonely-girl> digitalacetone: you can get a high performance system
15:45:07 <ivanm> digitalacetone: what do you get out of other general-purpose computer languages?
15:45:10 <mm_freak> dobblego: yes, sorry
15:45:18 <aristid> ivanm: oh, i wondered because ctrl+f had no effect in ghci
15:45:19 <ivanm> mm_freak: don't you listen to -Wall?
15:45:23 <ivanm> aristid: heh
15:45:26 <jmcarthur> ivanm: i suspect that digitalacetone doesn't know the answer to that question
15:45:28 <a-lonely-girl> it's super easy to build high performance system in haskell
15:45:31 <Gracenotes> is it just me, or did someone turn on the 5:1 surround sound?
15:45:32 <dobblego> mm_freak, also "Fine. Now wait for your opponent!" -- I've been waiting a while now
15:45:46 <a-lonely-girl> when performance matters, you should look at haskepp
15:45:47 <dafis> Gracenotes: accidentally enabled TH ?
15:45:48 <Veinor> dobblego: I think it's multiplayer-only
15:45:48 <mm_freak> dobblego: look at that case statement on selStr
15:45:55 <Tzarly> Gracenotes we're up to 7.1 now at least
15:45:56 <mm_freak> put the "" to the bottom and replace "" by _
15:46:02 <Saizan> Gracenotes: look for uses of $ with no whitespace
15:46:04 <Gracenotes> dafis: not accidentally enabled, it's rather intentional...
15:46:04 <dobblego> ah yes MVar
15:46:06 <mm_freak> and yes, i do listen to -Wall
15:46:07 <ivanm> jmcarthur: then I wonder why they've bothered coming here (and yes, I know about the reddit horde)...
15:46:08 <digitalacetone> jmcarthur: for the most part I do. Now the real question: Show me an example?
15:46:20 <mm_freak> but i have forgot to turn it on =)
15:46:24 <Gracenotes> Saizan: oooh. that might explain it.
15:46:31 <Gracenotes> actually let me move the TH stuff to another module
15:46:32 <digitalacetone> aside from calculating my age and letting me sort simple arrays
15:46:36 <lispy> What is the reddit horde?
15:46:38 <ivanm> mm_freak: tsk, tsk
15:46:38 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: everything here was created with haskell http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html

15:46:44 <lispy> Is it related to WoW?
15:46:53 <winxordie> lispy: it's the weaker cousin of the slashdot horde
15:46:58 <ivanm> lispy: a horde of people coming from reddit.com
15:47:00 <Gracenotes> Saizan: tis exactly it
15:47:13 <lispy> ivanm: why would people come here from reddit?
15:47:20 <ivanm> digitalacetone: just about any program you can think of can be written (or an equivalent) in Haskell
15:47:28 <ivanm> lispy: tryhaskell.org apparently reached the front page
15:47:33 <lispy> aaah
15:47:35 <lispy> Cool!
15:47:36 <dafis> lispy: reddit features tryhaskell with chat
15:47:41 <Saizan> Gracenotes: cheers :)
15:47:53 <aristid> lispy: i guess they all came here for the chat.
15:47:53 * dafis was too slow again
15:48:03 <Gracenotes> it was a map ($blah blah)
15:48:08 <cncl> putting instant irc web chat gateway is usually a recipe for disaster
15:48:17 <cncl> HAY GUISE WATS DIS CHANNEL
15:48:22 <Tzarly> lispy: tis apparently better than the digg herd
15:48:38 <lispy> I just went to that site, but I don't see the chat optin
15:48:40 <winxordie> cncl: I don't know, I'd appreciate the ycombinator lot on here
15:48:41 <Gracenotes> cncl: except that usually it's not

15:49:23 <Tzarly> lispy you may need to work your way through some of the actuall lessons
15:49:23 <jmcarthur> lispy: type chat into the console on the page
15:49:31 <lispy> Ah
15:49:39 <jmcarthur> lispy: the user is prompted after the "type your name" step
15:49:43 <cncl> oh it's not automatic, that's good
15:49:52 <jmcarthur> cncl: yeah, that has prevented the worst of it

15:51:29 <ivanm> zygotron: grrr, took you long enough...
15:51:38 <monochrom> there has been no disaster yet. after all these hours there has been only one troll and I +q'ed it promptly.
15:51:40 <Tzarly> How would one pass commands to the system from Haskell?
15:52:03 <Tzarly> There was a TROLL!?
15:52:04 <ivanm> Tzarly: you mean run system commands? there are a few ways of doing it
15:52:05 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: well, you can't on tryhaskell.org
15:52:07 <monochrom> But do worry about how you can serve beginners more quickly.
15:52:12 <Tzarly> where is it! kill it!
15:52:25 <monochrom> It was hours ago. It said "faggot".
15:52:29 <ivanm> monochrom: heh
15:52:32 <Tzarly> Ivanm: I'm all ears
15:52:33 <winxordie> Tzarly: you have to burn it. Trolls come back otherwise.
15:52:38 <jmcarthur> monochrom: there have been at least two. i +b'ed it at its own request
15:52:40 <ivanm> there have been a few uncomplimentary ones, but none that I've seen that bad
15:52:51 <monochrom> Oh, yes, I remember that one now. :)
15:52:55 <ivanm> @hoogle runInteractiveProcess
15:52:55 <zygotron> No results found
15:52:59 <ivanm> bah
15:53:10 <monochrom> and lambdabot is swimming
15:53:16 <Tzarly> I understand full well why it can't be run on tryhaskell.org I just hope chris did too

15:53:36 <jmcarthur> Tzarly: yeah, chris isn't allowing IO actions on the web site at all
15:53:45 <ivanm> jmcarthur: a troll asked to be blocked?
15:53:52 <dafis> ivanm: yep
15:53:55 <monochrom> yeah, a troll said "kick me!"
15:54:03 <jmcarthur> ivanm: i think he didn't believe me that we could ban his ip when he was using the web interface
15:54:10 <ivanm> lol
15:54:16 <listofoptions> lmao
15:54:24 <Philippa> or it could be someone on a shared connection pissing off their housemate, for example
15:54:34 <Philippa> kick us^Wme!
15:54:48 <jmcarthur> Philippa: the conversation leading up to that didn't appear to betray anything like that, at least
15:54:54 <ivanm> Philippa: which of course assumes the housemates want to learn Haskell...
15:54:57 <monochrom> anyway it is the most exaggerated doomsday theory since "LHC will make blackholes!"
15:55:06 <Tzarly> Thanks Ivanm: tell me, do you think those platform specific?
15:55:14 <dafis> monochrom: do you doubt that?
15:55:21 <Philippa> ivanm: I've lived in houses where everyone was a compsci student before, so it's not impossible
15:55:31 <ivanm> Tzarly: I don't think they are
15:55:54 <ivanm> but the ones that say they run in a shell typically run better on unix-like operating systems (since they look for programs using the PATH variable)
15:56:00 <ivanm> Philippa: fair enough
15:56:19 <Tzarly> Ever gotten to wiki and found your ip had already been blocked?
15:56:20 * ivanm has never shared houses with non-family members before
15:56:38 <jmcarthur> there's also university networks and stuff
15:56:50 <ivanm> Tzarly: wiki? no; other sites (forget which) when my ISP was using dynamic IPs? yes
15:56:58 * ivanm -> breakfast
15:56:59 <monochrom> sharing a computer is fine. sharing an account should be fined.
15:56:59 <EvanR> ivanm: avoid it at all costs
15:57:03 <Tzarly> :)
15:57:22 <digitalacetone> The only way i can try haskell aside of this demo to my left is to install it, correct?
15:57:35 <Tzarly> Tzarly -> Andromeda
15:57:40 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: codepad.org
15:57:47 <technogeeky> you could also use lambdabot here
15:57:51 <technogeeky> or private message him
15:57:55 <dobblego> digitalacetone, there are other means, but it's quite easy to install 
15:57:57 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: but it requires that you write full programs. it's just a read-eval-print loop
15:58:02 <ivanm> technogeeky: lambdabot is a girl... :p
15:58:04 <jmcarthur> *it's not a
15:58:05 <monochrom> lambdabot is a she. but she's dreaming now.
15:58:06 <Philippa> monochrom: sharing which kind of account? ISP accounts get shared in practice pretty routinely, not least because it's common to not be allowed multiple connections to one household
15:58:17 <jmcarthur> digitalacetone: i recommend just installing it though. it's quite easy and you can do a lot more
15:58:24 <Phred> how is lambdabot formed?
15:58:25 <EvanR> :t 'a'
15:58:26 <zygotron> Char
15:58:27 <Tomsik__> who put lambdabot to sleep?
15:58:30 <monochrom> sharing windows account or linux account on the same home computer
15:58:30 <technogeeky> ivanm: doh! well, i'll make sure her replacement is a transvestite so everyone can leave satisfied
15:58:49 <ice_slice> They got a nice IDE for mac?
15:59:00 <ice_slice> :D
15:59:18 <technogeeky> does that mean lambda is a fembot?
15:59:18 <monochrom> lambdabot is written in haskell
15:59:55 <Phred> So why not haskelbot?
16:00:08 <jmcarthur> ice_slice: there is an IDE, but i don't use it
16:00:11 <technogeeky> arbitrary choice
16:00:20 <jmcarthur> ice_slice: leksah is the name, i believe
16:00:30 <jmcarthur> ice_slice: i also don't know if it runs on os x or not
16:00:43 <jmcarthur> ice_slice: i just use emacs :)
16:00:50 <ice_slice> Do people here think that IDEs should be used while teaching students programming?
16:01:00 <ice_slice> Eclipse with its auto-completion makes it easy to be lazy.
16:01:04 <jmcarthur> i think IDEs are a waste of brain power
16:01:12 * dafis agrees
16:01:14 <monochrom> haskell makes it easy to be lazy too.
16:01:22 <JKelsey> hi
16:01:25 <jmcarthur> hi
16:01:26 <ice_slice> But I like Eclipse and its easy repository support and compare functions
16:01:37 <technogeeky> ice_slice: I think, in the future, IDEs of one sort or another will be integral to using these languages at all
16:01:38 <JKelsey> Whats going on everyone
16:01:44 <technogeeky> for the most useful languages :O
16:01:46 <perimosocordiae> for me Eclipse was a great exploratory tool
16:01:47 <jmcarthur> ice_slice: i think somebody made or is working on a haskell eclipse plugin
16:01:55 <monochrom> preflex: quote monochrom terminals
16:01:55 <preflex>  no quotes found for monochrom terminals
16:01:59 <BMeph> JKelsey: Everything's going on! ;)
16:02:00 <aristid> technogeeky: like Emacs?
16:02:04 <monochrom> preflex: quote ray terminals
16:02:05 <preflex>  no quotes found for ray terminals
16:02:06 <jmcarthur> emacs is not an ide
16:02:07 <technogeeky> aristid: not at all
16:02:07 <JKelsey> 8======D~~~
16:02:09 <monochrom> preflex: quote ray
16:02:10 <technogeeky> and yes, it is
16:02:10 <preflex>  no quotes found for ray
16:02:16 <technogeeky> it's a development environment
16:02:19 <jmcarthur> JKelsey: please be polite here
16:02:29 <JKelsey> sorry got ahead of myself
16:02:35 <technogeeky> clearly
16:02:44 <technogeeky> i don't know what came between us
16:02:53 <JKelsey> :D
16:02:54 <perimosocordiae> it's a good picture of a snake, though
16:03:00 <JKelsey> lol
16:03:01 * BMeph gives technogeeky a rimshot!
16:03:11 <omg> what does 'a' : 'b' : [] = ['a',  'b'] do? i just typed it in my mistake in tryhaskell.org and it didn't give an error
16:03:11 <technogeeky> snaaaaaaaake
16:03:15 <monochrom> IDE should be taught so 1970s terminals can finally die
16:03:17 <aristid> technogeeky: yes, emacs is a development environment, and i prefer it over eclipse, and i don't want to have to use eclipse to be able to write programs.
16:03:47 <technogeeky> aristid: sure, but that doesn't mean that some other, new development environment (say, one inside a web browser) can't be a useful tool to use the language
16:03:47 <jmcarthur> omg: it craps out if the 'a' and 'b' don't match :)
16:04:07 <technogeeky> obviously, there are prerequisites: the ability to open, read, edit, and save text files
16:04:16 <Saizan> > let 'a' : x : [] = ['a',  'b'] in x
16:04:16 <jmcarthur> omg: that's valid but not useful
16:04:16 <zygotron>   'b'
16:04:24 <jmcarthur> oh my bad
16:04:27 <jmcarthur> still not useful
16:04:43 <jmcarthur> unless you bind a variable
16:04:48 <aristid> technogeeky: i think we should stay compatible with simple text editors. so that even people who use editors as rudimentary as vim or notepad++ are not left out
16:05:17 <technogeeky> aristid: a world in which only (vim || emacs) || (eclipse || netbeans || ... ) is the universe of IDEs is a very sad world
16:05:22 <jmcarthur> i don't believe that programming languages should necessarily be limited to human-readable text formats
16:05:40 <Saizan> omg: in general on the left hand side of = you can have a "pattern", which looks like an expression, but where variables will be bound to the corresponding value on the right hand side
16:05:43 <jmcarthur> *but* we haven't any good alternatives yet, so human-readable text is the best we have :)
16:05:45 <ice_slice> Is it true that the cloud itself was written in Haskell? The underlying framework.
16:05:53 <jmcarthur> the cloud?
16:06:16 <monochrom> the cloud writes itself
16:06:23 <aristid> technogeeky: well, it's the current state of affairs, and i think it's not a sad state. i don't know how editors will look like in the future
16:06:31 <ice_slice> ex. Amazon EC2
16:06:34 <alex_kidd_> what is the cloud?
16:06:40 <alex_kidd_> rhetorical
16:06:43 <monochrom> jmcarthur: teaching everyone to use IDEs will break that vicious cycle.
16:06:58 <technogeeky> aristid: I think it's sad because so many of them copy each other's features without improving, adapting, or upgrading them
16:07:00 <jmcarthur> monochrom: IDEs are just human-readable text today anyway
16:07:04 <BMeph> > let a:'x':a:[] = "exe" in a
16:07:05 <zygotron>   Conflicting definitions for `a'
16:07:05 <zygotron>  Bound at: <interactive>:1:4
16:07:05 <zygotron>            <in...
16:07:09 <monochrom> Yes, transitionally.
16:07:19 <aristid> technogeeky: to improve, you need to know how
16:07:34 <jmcarthur> i'm not sure there is much incentive to use IDEs unless they are demonstrably better than writing plain text
16:07:39 <omg> ah i get it now thanks
16:07:56 <technogeeky> aristid: yes, and there are plenty of examples of things one can do, but not all of them fit within the "standard" active document inside project format
16:08:13 <msieradzki> IDEs are for text completion
16:08:21 <msieradzki> and searching function calls
16:08:21 <technogeeky> jmcarthur: well, unless you write plain text with notepad and no syntax hilighting or code completion
16:08:25 <jmcarthur> msieradzki: kind of a boring ide
16:08:25 <technogeeky> then you're using an IDE
16:08:32 <monochrom> But most IDEs are already demonstrably better than plain text. Plain text doesn't let you hide/show various definitions and import statements. IDEs do.
16:08:39 <technogeeky> one example is the code bubbles concept
16:08:39 <aristid> jmcarthur: there's plenty of incentive to use emacs for those who can overcome it's problems.
16:08:41 <lispy> msieradzki: hoogle is good for searching too
16:08:47 <technogeeky> which is nice, though infantile at the moment
16:08:51 <msieradzki> lispy, especially for my own code, yes
16:08:51 <technogeeky> then there's the tabstop mechanism
16:09:00 <jmcarthur> i'm using a stricter definition of IDE than most of you guys are i think
16:09:11 <aristid> technogeeky: you really would need to overcome the huge versatility of text files
16:09:16 <msieradzki> integrated where user can't even click on anything not in IDE's menu?
16:09:23 <aristid> technogeeky: that is a really tough barrier
16:09:26 <technogeeky> i happen to think that the utility of haskell could dramatically improve in this area if we had a working body which figured it out
16:09:30 <mats_> might anyone know if it's possible to make a stand-along Haskell executable that doesn't require the Runtime installed? (I'm looking for a way to package the Runtime as a bunch of ANSI C files, if it's somehow compile the Runtime with ghc while statically linking and dump as C files or something...)
16:09:35 <Lycurgus> http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27619
16:09:44 <Lycurgus> anybody know what that's about?
16:09:49 <lispy> technogeeky: what is a working body?
16:09:53 <EvanR> mats_: the runtime is usually statically linked
16:09:59 <aristid> technogeeky: i can embed text files in emails. i can run diff on them. i can easily put them in version control. i can grep them, there are so many tools that work on text files.
16:10:00 <technogeeky> a collection of individuals to guide work
16:10:14 <EvanR> mats_: see ldd myhaskellprog.exe
16:10:25 <jmcarthur> Lycurgus: your version of ghc is too old for that package
16:10:34 <technogeeky> aristid: well, there are limitations. those things you mentioned involved changing encodings, possibly
16:10:45 <Saizan> Lycurgus: it's about the ghc library package, not the compiler itself
16:11:01 <Lycurgus> jmcarthur, it's not my post but as it shows 6.12 is installed
16:11:02 <jmcarthur> oh
16:11:09 <aristid> technogeeky: so if you have ideas for how to improve on that, research them, but don't be sad if people will not immediately accept them. not reaching a global optimum immediately is not "sad"
16:11:17 <jmcarthur> that is not an error i've seen before
16:11:24 <jmcarthur> Lycurgus: you're right. my bad
16:11:29 <technogeeky> aristid: I used poor language there.
16:11:37 <technogeeky> Our IDEs have evolved less intelligently than our languages.
16:11:44 <jmcarthur> i agree there
16:11:49 <BMeph> Why can't you have auxiliary files in addition to the text files? That way you can still read the program if that's what you want.
16:11:49 <Saizan> Lycurgus: the sad part is that vector shouldn't depend on ghc-the-library
16:11:52 <technogeeky> It's not sad, because I don't know what I'd be happy with.
16:12:09 <Lycurgus> in summary what's the practical solution?
16:12:27 <technogeeky> There are some new IDEs that are cool
16:12:31 <technogeeky> the android UI IDE is pretty fantastic
16:12:49 <technogeeky> I just happen to think that haskell could really take a big leap forward in adoption
16:12:52 <aristid> technogeeky: am i old-fashioned if i think that emacs is cool, too? :D
16:12:52 <lispy> technogeeky: you might like suppl
16:12:55 <technogeeky> by picking up mathematics/physics students

16:13:54 <Lycurgus> acknowledged
16:14:57 <Saizan> Lycurgus: the other option is to: cabal unpack vector; cd vector-*; remove ghc from build-depends in the .cabal file; bump the version field; cabal install
16:15:15 <lispy> technogeeky: more generally, you might want to start watching the IUI conference.  Intelligent User Interfaces.  They have some cool papers.
16:15:49 <technogeeky> lispy: ok
16:16:26 * ezyang is having too much fun with view patterns 
16:16:35 <Isaiahs> Giant cocks
16:16:39 <Isaiahs> Giant cocks
16:16:43 <Isaiahs> Giant cocks
16:16:49 <lispy> technogeeky: I would like to see more intelligence baked into our programming environments for assisting human reasoning about programs
16:17:03 <mats_> EvanR: thank you; would this mean that if I was able to disassemble a myHaskellProgram.o, I could run it almost anywhere?
16:17:12 <lispy> ezyang: hehe.  I've always meant to look them up.
16:17:16 <technogeeky> lispy: I am very interested in doing that, specifically with regard to visualization of "lines of code" and types specifically
16:17:16 <EvanR> mats_: no
16:17:30 <technogeeky> i need to put together some mockups to demonstrate what I see
16:17:32 <EvanR> mats_: not without ghfrigginc.o
16:18:04 <int80_h> has the Great Trll Invasion of '10 been abated yet?
16:18:20 <technogeeky> lispy: I figure I'll get the ball rolling in here along with the help of the haskell-maths people
16:18:41 <lispy> technogeeky: are you a graduate student or researcher?
16:18:52 <ezyang> technogeeky: Is this something along the lines of draw diagrams of types with functions moving between them? 
16:19:02 <aristid> @pl f = getLine >>= \a -> if a == "" then return () else f
16:19:03 <zygotron> (line 1, column 3):
16:19:03 <zygotron> unexpected "="
16:19:03 <zygotron> expecting variable, "(", operator or end of input
16:19:10 <technogeeky> ezyang: I cant' say that yet
16:19:21 <technogeeky> I'll draw up some mocks and share them
16:20:11 <lispy> technogeeky: you might also study natural deduction notation because of the curry-howard correspondence
16:20:46 <EvanR> mats_: yourprog.exe should run anywhere (unless you have dependency on other libs)
16:20:48 <mats_> EvanR: thanks again; ldd seems to say that GHfrigginC.o is not a dynamic executable; would the two files be sufficient, or am I missing something else important here? =)
16:20:59 <BMeph> Well, off to Lurk for a while...
16:21:12 <tg_afk> lisy: ok, noted
16:21:14 <EvanR> mats_: yes. you are missing something. you have to link the two .o files (ghc is really a .a) before it will run
16:21:48 <dobblego> aristid, (getLines >>=) . unless (null a)
16:21:54 <dildonomics> this try haskell webpage is cool
16:22:00 <dobblego> aristid, oops
16:22:10 <EvanR> dildonomics: are you new?
16:22:16 <aristid> dobblego: there seems to be no getLines
16:22:22 <dildonomics> EvanR: yes
16:22:23 <dobblego> aristid, getLine >>= unless . null
16:22:26 <EvanR> cool
16:22:30 <mats_> EvanR: gotcha, thanks. what do you mean yourprog.exe though? is that a synonym for the yourprog.o I would get from compiling on Linux?
16:22:50 <EvanR> mats_: no, on linux is yourprog. .exe is the extension for finally runnable linked binaries
16:22:52 <aristid> btw. i think the idea that people who have learned imperative programming are worse off at learning haskell than people who have no programming experience at all, is BOGUS
16:22:55 <aristid> there, i said it :P
16:23:34 <aristid> dobblego: invalid code, and also no "looping"
16:23:35 <EvanR> mats_: on windows
16:23:36 <dobblego> aristid, you haven't done very much teaching then :)
16:23:47 <aristid> dobblego: i have done learning
16:23:58 <dobblego> aristid, right, but that's not teaching
16:23:59 <aristid> and i don't think my many years of c++ were useless :P
16:24:00 <Lycurgus> Saizan, thanks, didn't work but thanks anyway
16:24:06 <dildonomics> what do most people use Haskell for?
16:24:13 <dobblego> aristid, I don't doubt it
16:24:16 <tolkad> How does haskell compare to forth?
16:24:18 <dildonomics> this looks like its for corporate stuff
16:24:27 <tolkad> dildonomics: yeah, mostly legacy systems
16:24:36 <aristid> haskell is like COBOL
16:24:37 <dildonomics> oh 
16:24:40 <aristid> a dead language
16:24:49 <aristid> just kidding :P
16:25:04 <dildonomics> anyone here do work with Android?
16:25:12 <dobblego> aristid, it's invalid code because my copy/paste stopped working and I had a transcription error
16:25:26 <jmcarthur> dildonomics: haskell is actually more tied to academia than to enterprise or legacy stuff
16:25:27 <tolkad> dildonomics: Yeah, I design them in a secret military facility
16:25:32 <aristid> dobblego: uh?
16:25:37 <dildonomics> tolkad: why
16:25:48 <dobblego> aristid, use unless
16:25:54 <tolkad> dildonomics: Our androids have infiltered the highest levels of governments around the world
16:26:01 <tolkad> infiltrated*

16:26:07 <zygotron> Control.Monad unless :: Monad m => Bool -> m () -> m ()
16:26:24 <dildonomics> tolkad: why are you acting like a dildo
16:26:47 <tolkad> dildonomics: please refrain from such language, it scares lambdabot
16:27:05 <jmcarthur> guys...
16:27:08 <jmcarthur> be excellent to each other
16:27:29 <lispy> Most excellent
16:30:00 <zachary> great website :)
16:30:18 <aristid> dobblego: thanks, this works: f = getLine >>= flip (unless . null) f
16:30:30 <aristid> but i'd like to make it pointfree
16:30:33 <dobblego> aristid, np
16:30:39 <dobblego> aristid, you might want to look at fix
16:30:46 <jmcarthur> @pl f = getLine >>= flip (unless . null) f
16:30:46 <dobblego> @type fix
16:30:46 <zygotron> f = fix ((getLine >>=) . flip (unless . null))
16:30:47 <zygotron> forall a. (a -> a) -> a
16:31:08 <aristid> :t fix ((getLine >>=) . flip (unless . null))
16:31:09 <zygotron> IO ()
16:31:43 <aristid> why does @pl work now, and didn't work earlier
16:31:49 <aristid> does it not like if-then-else?
16:31:52 <jmcarthur> because now we have zygotron 
16:31:55 <jmcarthur> oh
16:32:01 <jmcarthur> i doubt it like that, yea

16:38:14 <vitaliy> hello
16:38:15 <ivanm> tolkad: so, have you turned into a spammer?
16:38:21 <vitaliy> what
16:38:28 * ivanm waves idly in vitaliy's general direction
16:38:37 <vitaliy> i dont wave back
16:38:48 <ivanm> O...K...
16:38:53 <tolkad> ivanm: no
16:38:59 <Guest98552> no wat
16:39:01 <tolkad> ivanm: I saw that site linked to from reddit
16:39:06 <ivanm> tolkad: ahhh
16:39:19 <tolkad> ivanm: I was really surprised, I didn't know it was that easy to get a degree
16:39:30 <ivanm> tolkad: in case you weren't aware... it's not...
16:39:38 <ivanm> not if you wanted the degree to be legitimate, anyway
16:39:39 <danderson> also, this isn't ##reddit
16:39:41 <ivanm> ;-)
16:39:45 <ivanm> danderson: true
16:40:33 <mats_> EvanR: thanks, I finally understand. unfortunately "ldd myprog" is saying that it depends on the shared libraries {linux-vdso,.so.1, libm.so.6, libffi.so.5, libgmp.so.3, libdl.so.2, librt.so.1, libc.so.6, /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, libpthread.so.0}; did you imply that ldd should say "not a dynamic executable" when run on the myprog executable?
16:40:53 <EvanR> mats_: thats normal
16:41:05 <tolkad> I suppose you wouldn't learn anything getting a degree there anyway
16:41:31 <EvanR> mats_: gmp is the only thing people may not have
16:41:52 <EvanR> its installed standard on a lot of distros
16:42:40 <tolkad> What version control systems do haskell programmers use?
16:42:45 <ivanm> tolkad: well, yeah, seeing as how you don't have classes...
16:42:56 <ivanm> tolkad: usually darcs, some people use git and there's also a couple of mercurial users IIRC
16:43:20 <ivanm> (darcs mainly because of the whole "eat your own dogfood" thing)
16:43:46 <sm> actually, because it's easier
16:43:58 <mats_>  EvanR: I'm actually attempting to pump C code through the Clue compiler to compile it into javascript =), so it seems I'll basically have to provide a hacked/stub version for all of these I think =\
16:44:12 <tolkad> mats_: 0_o
16:44:18 <EvanR> k well haskell code isnt c code and neither is a binary
16:44:26 <ivanm> sm: well, if darcs was written in C or something would we all have started using it?
16:44:37 <sm> I would have, sure
16:44:50 <mats_> EvanR: I was originally attempting to grab the .hc files
16:44:56 <tolkad> mats_: why would you ever want to do something like that? It doesn't make any sense to go from a (relatively) low level language to a high level one like that
16:45:06 <EvanR> hc files >_>
16:45:55 <ivanm> @remember blackh This is Haskell so we can do whatever we like.
16:45:55 <zygotron> I will never forget.
16:46:01 <mats_> though then I noticed all the dependencies on Stg.h etc. and was wondering with the best way to "compile/include the runtime"
16:46:17 <EvanR> into javascaript?
16:46:21 <ivanm> (just in case jfreddet goes through these logs for quotes for his next issue of Haskell Whenever-it-actually-appears News :p)
16:46:25 * EvanR hands mats_ some sanity
16:46:33 <tolkad> evanr: it's probably going to end up being an inefficient messs
16:46:34 <jmcarthur> cainabel
16:46:41 * mats_ thanks EvanR for the much-needed sanity.
16:46:44 <jmcarthur> there goes that password
16:47:07 <mats_> tolkad: for the flexibility; it doesn't really matter if Haskell run 100x slower in a web browser, because one doesn't really need speed, just the awesomeness of writing web-code in a nice functional language
16:47:08 <jmcarthur> at least it was one of my bad ones
16:47:23 <EvanR> mats_: you can already do that
16:47:31 <EvanR> several haskell web frameworks
16:47:54 <mats_> EvanR: they're all server-side iirc?
16:48:09 <EvanR> isnt there a haskell to javascript compiler
16:48:55 <blackh> ivanm: You've quoted me out of context. :)
16:49:07 <tolkad> mats_: if you compile to C then JavaScript you will have completely unnecssary memory management/pointer safety stuff
16:49:17 <ivanm> blackh: isn't that the whole point though? :p
16:49:26 <mats_> EvanR: yup (we might have had this conversation before o.o), but it's an old version of ghc that I have no idea how to get to work; the compiler sat in the source tree somewhere and did some magic to compile the STG into javascript
16:49:43 <blackh> ivanm: I don't mind.
16:50:13 <kmc> EVERYONE READY TO LEARN COBOL?!?!?!?!?
16:50:18 <mats_> tolkad: unfortunately yes, I really wanted to avoid this but have no idea how to get http://vir.mskhug.ru/browser/ghc/ghc-6.8.2/compiler/javascriptGen/JavascriptGen.hs to work

16:50:47 <Arnar> hey all
16:50:58 * ivanm waves idly in Arnar's general direction
16:51:10 <ezyang> I don't remember which language it was for. 
16:51:18 <kmc> what kind of category-theoretic construct is a 'bol', i wonder
16:51:20 <chris_____> did anybody else see the new xzibit/inception pic?  roflcopter
16:51:22 <Arnar> is there a good reason (a -> b) was removed from the DeepSeq/NFData type class in Control.Parallel.Strategies?
16:51:40 <kmc> Arnar, how do you reduce a function to normal form?
16:51:47 <monochrom> a->b is pretty hard to "evaluate fully"
16:51:54 <kmc> unless you have (Enum a, Bounded a)
16:52:02 <kmc> and even in that case it's probably not what you want ;P
16:52:23 <ivanm> kmc: do an automagic INLINE wrapper around it? :p
16:52:31 <Arnar> kmc: I thought a function *was in* normal form
16:52:34 <monochrom> then again perhaps you just want the a->b instance to do nothing.
16:52:41 <kmc> Arnar, whnf yes,  not full normal form
16:52:50 <kmc> Arnar, it might have a redex under the lambda, and there's no way to see that in Haskell
16:52:52 <Arnar> kmc: ok.. rephrase: why was it in the DeepSeq class in previous versions of the parallels pkg?
16:52:56 <Veinor> kmc: Learn You a COBOL!
16:53:01 <Arnar> kmc: aha ok
16:53:05 <kmc> Arnar, maybe a magical implementation-dependent NFData instance is possible
16:53:10 <kmc> not ordinary hs

17:00:47 <Mangina> <Mangina>
17:00:50 <Mangina> Helllo!
17:00:56 <Mangina> Fellow redditors?
17:01:04 <Tomsik__> Not me.

17:01:14 <mwatson_> here too
17:01:16 <Mangina> -high five-
17:01:23 <Tomsik__> And I'd like to notice we're just 6 people on the channel short of 666.
17:01:34 <s3krit> more languages should have this 'feature'
17:01:37 <aristid> the record today was in the 690s
17:01:40 <aristid> i think
17:01:44 <Mangina> Tomsik, I'm sorry you are not part of the Reddit community.
17:01:49 <Polarina> Does anyone know of some software that creates an in-memory bitmap (or whatever) LaTeX rendering of a mathematical equation?
17:01:51 <Mangina> Cyber Police is on it's way.
17:02:07 <aristid> Mangina: well, the reddit community is the minority here.
17:02:08 <Veinor> 690s sounds about right
17:02:09 <Mangina> Consequenses will never be the same.
17:02:20 <Mangina> :|
17:02:21 <Veinor> also, yes.
17:02:22 <aristid> Mangina: and if you're not interested in haskell, and only in the reddit community, why did you come here?
17:02:29 <ivanm> Polarina: ummm.... tex-math? (or whatever the package that pandoc uses is called)
17:02:36 <Mangina> Because I  dislike the reddit community?
17:02:39 <Mangina> they are a minority.
17:02:47 <Mangina> I want to be with the white people.
17:02:47 <Polarina> ivanm, I'll check those out. Thanks.
17:03:08 <Mangina> I don't even know what haskell is.

17:03:58 <Mangina> Wow thanks.
17:04:36 <Phyx-> Mangina: i'm curious how you got here without knowing what haskell is
17:04:43 <Mangina> Reddit.
17:04:45 <Phyx-> doesn't the tutorial have you do some steps before you get the chat
17:05:18 <Zao> Phyx-: Probably mentioned by some commenter or something.
17:05:20 <Phyx-> Mangina: don't you have to do 6 steps before you get told about chat?
17:05:23 <Phyx-> Zao: ah
17:05:29 <Mangina> you don't
17:05:39 <Mangina> o_o....
17:05:43 <s3krit> or you could just type chat
17:05:48 <Mangina> yes.
17:05:57 <Mangina> you just type chat.
17:06:00 <Mangina> and you're here.
17:06:00 <Phyx-> yes
17:06:06 <Mangina> :D amazing isn't it.
17:06:07 <Phyx-> but it doesn't tell you upfront about it
17:06:12 <Mangina> I just loopholed Haskell.
17:06:13 <Zao> It's not the most discoverable function.
17:06:17 <Mangina> I should be made admin.
17:06:18 <Phyx-> the reason is, it wants to tell you about haskell first
17:06:23 <Saizan> preflex: tell chrisdone remove the "chat" command to enter the chat
17:06:23 <preflex>  Consider it noted.
17:06:42 <Mangina> I am a mother f*** genious.
17:06:49 <Phyx-> Saizan: I wouldn't go that far, just have it be really mandatory to first do some steps
17:06:55 <Zao> Mangina: Speling is overated.
17:06:57 <Mangina> Call me...... Chris # 2.
17:06:58 <Phyx-> that typing "chat" won't just send you here
17:06:59 <Tomsik__> Yeah, you f***ed your mother and it makes you a genius. Indeed.
17:07:07 <ivanm> Saizan: yes, I would also be happy if that functionality was removed...

17:09:05 <Arnar> @pl \x -> fromJust $ lookup x l
17:09:06 <zygotron> fromJust . flip lookup l
17:09:25 --- mode: Philippa set -o Philippa
17:09:27 <ivanm> s3krit: lisp isn't really functional... it supports FP-style programming, but lisp is not really an FP lang
17:09:33 <lispy> I no longer have ops here.  I should probably be removed from that list 
17:09:38 <Phyx-> Veinor: agreed, it'll eventually settle down and we would get some new people interested in Haskell
17:09:39 <s3krit> oh right
17:09:42 <Arnar> ivanm: what is an FP lang?
17:09:48 <Philippa> it spells my nick wrong too
17:09:57 <ivanm> FP == Functional Programming
17:10:00 <ivanm> lispy: :o
17:10:15 <Saizan> lispy: anyone can alter the list with @where+ 
17:10:15 <Gommle> When I type Alt+Gr + 8, both 8 and [ shows in, on Try haskell. Norwegian layout
17:10:22 <ivanm> Philippa: well, it's an old list probably... I mean, zygotron still has the tinyurl plugin enabled
17:10:23 <Arnar> ivanm: I know that.. I was asking what is your definition of a functional language
17:10:35 <lispy> Saizan: heh, I didn't know that
17:10:36 <Phyx-> > 8
17:10:39 <zygotron>   8
17:10:47 <Phyx-> botty still dead?
17:10:51 <ivanm> Arnar: ahhh... languages that are primarily FP-oriented; arguably only languages like Haskell and Clean are truly FP
17:10:55 <ivanm> due to purity
17:10:58 <ivanm> Phyx-: yup
17:10:59 <lispy> I wrote that plugin actually
17:11:03 <lispy> I think
17:11:18 <neburel> hello
17:11:21 <Arnar> ivanm: ok, if you require purity you are excluding the majority of languages that have been called functional for decads
17:11:21 <EvanR> purity must be enforced at the language level before its fp?
17:11:24 <Arnar> decades*
17:11:33 <Saizan> Gommle: opera perhaps? there are some known issues
17:11:37 <Phyx-> neburel: hi
17:11:43 <Gommle> yes, opera
17:11:46 <ivanm> Arnar: yeah, I know; I didn't say I necessarily thought so though :p
17:11:54 <mm_freak> ivanm: i don't think purity is a requirement for functional programming
17:11:55 <Arnar> :)
17:12:06 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hi.
17:12:07 <ivanm> mm_freak: I didn't say I thought that!!!!!
17:12:12 <Veinor> Eduard_Munteanu: Hi.
17:12:14 <Arnar> mm_freak: "functional programming" isn't universally defined.. so 
17:12:16 <ivanm> I just said "arguably", not that I supported that
17:12:20 <progn00b> my name is tamara sheenequa
17:12:22 <Arnar> it's all up to your definition
17:12:30 <lispy> IMO, functional programming is about using transformations to get from input to output
17:12:30 <Arnar> nothing is "required", there is no FP police
17:12:32 <EvanR> fp means a lot more than oop
17:12:54 <lispy> You can do it to differing degrees.
17:13:01 <Arnar> in my view I would say any lang which can manipulate functions as first class values is functional
17:13:02 <Veinor> weeoooweeoooweeoo it's the functional programming police!
17:13:12 <ivanm> lispy: isn't that kinda the point of programming in general though? :p
17:13:13 <Saizan> FP is when you have (.) in the standard library 
17:13:25 <mm_freak> yes, my definition of FP is:  supporting HOF, closures, lambda expressions and with base libraries, which use FP style rather than imperative (loop/state/handle) style
17:13:31 <ivanm> Saizan: heh, nice definition
17:13:32 <micrypt_> Is it possible to combine oop with fp, or would that be "doing it wrong"/impractical?
17:13:46 <EvanR> i wouldnt call a command to overwrite data in a database, then another command to get the data out a transformation
17:13:47 <|marius|> i'd define "functional" as value-oriented
17:13:48 <ivanm> micrypt_: OCaml, F# claim to do that
17:13:50 <mm_freak> this makes even C# a functional language
17:13:51 <msieradzki> FP language has working tail call optimization :)
17:13:52 <ivanm> as does Scala
17:13:56 <Arnar> mm_freak: ok, I agree - except on the last point :)  ... e.g. python is functional in my mind
17:14:01 <ivanm> msieradzki: Haskell doesn't really have TCO...
17:14:04 <ivanm> due to laziness
17:14:11 <aristid> @hoogle m () -> Bool
17:14:11 <zygotron> Data.IntMap null :: IntMap a -> Bool
17:14:12 <zygotron> Data.Maybe isJust :: Maybe a -> Bool
17:14:12 <zygotron> Data.Maybe isNothing :: Maybe a -> Bool
17:14:17 <mm_freak> msieradzki: that's not the language, it's the compiler/interpreter
17:14:26 <Phyx-> mm_freak: some part of it is
17:14:36 <Eduard_Munteanu> Now a really tough one... any imperative pure languages? :)
17:14:40 <Phyx-> mm_freak: linq can be viewed as FP
17:14:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> Since we're debating such stuff.
17:14:46 <Phyx-> it's also lazy
17:14:47 <EvanR> purely imperative!
17:14:48 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: haskell
17:14:54 <mm_freak> and clean
17:14:56 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: heh
17:15:08 <Arnar> micrypt_: functional and oo are orthogonal, so there is nothing wrong with combining them..
17:15:12 <stelleg> @hoogle t printStrLn
17:15:12 <zygotron> No results found
17:15:17 <mm_freak> Phyx-: LINQ is already much more than FP =)
17:15:22 <mm_freak> it's monadic programming in C#
17:15:35 <msieradzki> linq is lazy
17:15:36 <Saizan> Veinor: "functional programming police" made me thing of the spanish inquisition, "nobody expects .." and all :)
17:15:42 <ivanm> Arnar: well, last I heard hardly any OCaml users do OO stuff in it
17:15:43 <Eduard_Munteanu> Haskell looks pretty OO to me, even though it doesn't fully fulfill the criteria.
17:15:44 <EvanR> Arnar: unless you subscribe to the purity requirement of functional, and the traditionally oo requirement of mutable objects
17:15:45 <ivanm> same with Scala
17:15:52 <Eduard_Munteanu> IOW, it replaces OO well.
17:15:54 <EvanR> which is opposites
17:16:03 <Arnar> ivanm: that's just because OO only fits very specific types of problems
17:16:09 <Phyx-> mm_freak: :P
17:16:22 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: in haskell there are much better concepts than OOP
17:16:37 <mm_freak> like concurrency, FRP, laziness, etc.
17:16:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah, I agree.
17:16:48 <Zao> s/better/different/
17:16:57 <mm_freak> better for the applications i've written so far
17:16:59 <etpace> How can I add a DiffTime to a UTCTime?
17:17:05 <etpace> so something like UTCTime -> DIffTime -> UTCTime
17:17:31 <aristid> @hoogle UTCTime -> DiffTime -> UTCTime
17:17:32 <zygotron> Prelude const :: a -> b -> a
17:17:32 <zygotron> Data.Function const :: a -> b -> a
17:17:32 <zygotron> Prelude seq :: a -> b -> b
17:17:37 <aristid> was worth a try :D
17:17:40 <etpace> :p
17:17:45 <ivanm> etpace: addUTCTime?
17:17:50 <Eduard_Munteanu> Also Haskell is a lot more flexible wrt paradigms.
17:17:53 <etpace> seems to take a NominalDiffTime
17:17:54 <ivanm> it uses NominalDiffTime though rather than DiffTime
17:17:58 <ivanm> not sure what the difference is
17:18:11 <etpace> I ca't seem to craft a NominalDiffTime like: secondsToDiffTime 5
17:18:17 <ivanm> there's probably conversion functions from one to the other though
17:18:17 <Eduard_Munteanu> (i.e. there are a lot more ways of doing something)
17:18:39 <etpace> @hoogle DiffTime -> NominalDiffTime
17:18:39 <zygotron> Unsafe.Coerce unsafeCoerce :: a -> b
17:18:40 <zygotron> Prelude ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
17:18:40 <zygotron> Prelude ($!) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
17:18:46 <ivanm> FormatTime?
17:19:12 <etpace> eh?
17:19:21 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: like in CL, it's easy to write domain-specific languages in haskell
17:19:27 <ivanm> nah, FormatTime is for time -> String
17:19:38 <etpace> parseTime maybe?
17:19:39 <etpace> something like
17:19:41 <ivanm> ummm... maybe via Enum or something?
17:19:44 <Phyx-> @src unsafeCoerce
17:19:44 <zygotron> Source not found. Sorry about this, I know it's a bit silly.
17:19:56 <mm_freak> etpace: NominalDiffTime is a Num instance
17:20:04 <mm_freak> > 0 :: NominalDiffTime
17:20:05 <zygotron>   Not in scope: type constructor or class `NominalDiffTime'
17:20:11 <Veinor> unsafeCoerce = unsafeCoerce#
17:20:13 <Veinor> :)
17:20:17 <Phyx-> rofl
17:20:19 <etpace> yes but how do I construct a NominalDiffTime?
17:20:28 <ivanm> etpace: look in Data.Time.Clock.POSIX
17:20:28 <Veinor> what's the source of unsafeCoerce#? I dunno.
17:20:47 <ivanm> no, wait, that doesn't help *sigh*
17:20:51 <mm_freak> etpace: by making use of that Num instance =)
17:20:58 <ivanm> I _think_ you want toEnum . fromEnum
17:21:06 <ivanm> but that's probably a hacky solution
17:21:21 <mm_freak> being a Num instance means you can wrap numbers easily by just writing them literally =)
17:21:27 <etpace> oh I see
17:21:29 <etpace> doh, cheers
17:21:36 <mm_freak> as said:  0 :: NominalDiffTime
17:21:37 <mm_freak> ;)
17:21:53 <ivanm> mm_freak: how does that let you do conversions though?
17:22:04 <dons> hey guys. torrents for Haskell Platform 2010.2.0.0 are up now (for Windows). Seed! http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2010.2.0.0/torrents/ 
17:22:04 <zygotron> Title: Index of /platform/2010.2.0.0/torrents
17:22:14 <mm_freak> ivanm: conversions?
17:22:26 <ivanm> mm_freak: he wants to do DiffTime -> NominalDiffTime
17:22:59 <EvanR> fromInteger ?
17:23:08 <kfish> heya dons
17:23:09 <ivanm> EvanR: well, DiffTime /= Integer
17:23:15 <EvanR> ah
17:23:18 <EvanR> fromIntegral
17:23:20 <EvanR> ?
17:23:31 <ivanm> EvanR: it's not an Integral either
17:23:35 <EvanR> >_<
17:23:38 <EvanR> fromEnum
17:23:57 <mm_freak> ivanm: fromRational . toRational
17:24:15 <ivanm> oh, right
17:24:19 <ivanm> missed the Fractioanl instance
17:24:28 <mm_freak> :t fromRational . toRational :: DiffTime -> NominalDiffTime
17:24:29 <zygotron>     Not in scope: type constructor or class `DiffTime'
17:24:29 <zygotron>     Not in scope: type constructor or class `NominalDiffTime'
17:24:33 <mm_freak> that's the Real instance =)
17:24:35 <danderson> dons: I'm going to write a cereal builder for torrent files. Looks like the one I gave you is missing some useful stuff again.
17:24:57 <danderson> it'll work fine in the meantime, I'll just get you an updated one for the release
17:26:18 <ivanm> dons: out of curiosity, do you read everything you put on /r/haskell? or just see that it's haskelly and put it there? :p
17:26:26 <stelleg> is it possible to have infix data constructors?
17:26:33 <dons> ivanm: most of it, yes.
17:26:38 <dons> danderson: nice
17:26:59 <c_wraith> Ooh, I have a new most-convoluted type signature for code I've written for a good reason:  (IConnection a, MonadIO m) => (forall c d. m c -> IO d -> m c) -> Pool a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
17:27:06 <ivanm> dons: asking, because my post still hasn't gotten replies and I was hoping you at least would be able to comment on the optimisation stuff I was asking about there :p
17:27:33 <mm_freak> stelleg: yes
17:27:42 <c_wraith> unfortunately, that "good reason" is that MonadCatchIO is broken.
17:27:54 <stelleg> i.e. data X = X (F) X
17:28:14 <mm_freak> `F`
17:28:26 <ivanm> c_wraith: bah, that type signature is nothing: see the type for emap here: http://code.haskell.org/FGL/fgl/Data/Graph/Inductive/Graph.hs :p
17:28:26 <mm_freak> or you use operators prefixed with :
17:28:29 <dons> ivanm: well, i don't have a lot of time to comment 
17:28:36 <ivanm> dons: fair enough
17:28:40 <micrypt_> Just came across cons, it's so pretty. :) 
17:29:23 <mm_freak> cons?  (:)?
17:29:42 <Saizan> (:[]) -- the monkey operator is even better
17:29:42 <micrypt_> mm_freak: Yes. I'm easily amused. ^^
17:29:52 <ivanm> mm_freak: file:///home/ivan/Haskell/containers/dist/doc/html/container-classes/Data-Containers.html#v%3Acons :p
17:29:57 <EvanR> lol
17:30:10 <EvanR> :t (:[])
17:30:11 <zygotron> forall a. a -> [a]
17:30:22 <c_wraith> ivanm: that doesn't have any higher-ranked types in it though!
17:30:26 <EvanR> it eats anything and shits out a singleton list

17:32:00 <mm_freak> ah
17:32:10 <Phyx-> Oh my... I just spend 30min changing the wrong file
17:32:15 * Phyx- does svn revert
17:32:34 <ivanm> Phyx-: ugh, I've dont that :s
17:32:37 <ivanm> *done
17:32:49 <micrypt_> There's apparently a Haskell Meetup in London now (In case anyone here's based there).
17:32:56 <Phyx-> ivanm: yeah, thank god for version control
17:33:12 <ivanm> Phyx-: of course, if you had a better VCS it might be even easier... :p
17:33:35 <Phyx-> ivanm: are you trying to suggest darcs ? :P
17:33:54 <ivanm> or any other DVCS
17:34:35 <Phyx-> how would a DVCS be better in this case though? I would have had to undo the changes anyway
17:35:19 <ivanm> smaller changes? *shrug*
17:35:26 <ivanm> just doing a very slight troll
17:36:28 <Phyx-> lol
17:36:48 <micrypt_> Book recommendations?
17:36:53 <Phyx-> that's allowed once in a while :P
17:36:57 <Phyx-> micrypt_: to do what?
17:37:32 <ivanm> micrypt_: for Haskell?
17:37:37 <micrypt_> Phyx: For Haskell
17:37:40 <ivanm> Craft of Functional Programming by Simon Thompson

17:38:29 <sproingie> Haskell: 4 out of 5 Simons recommend it.
17:38:34 <ivanm> sproingie: heh
17:38:38 <Phyx-> ivanm: It's has an slow start, So it should be easy to follow though
17:38:39 <pastorn> zygotron? what has happened to lambdabot?
17:38:42 <pastorn> did she die?
17:38:50 <ivanm> on holidays
17:39:02 <pastorn> hehe
17:39:03 <micrypt_> Thanks
17:39:07 <Phyx-> sproingie: if your name is Simon, you have to do FP :P
17:39:07 <pastorn> when's she coming back?
17:39:35 <Phyx-> pastorn: if there are no more volcano eruptions, maybe in a day or two
17:39:36 <Phyx-> :P
17:39:52 <pastorn> haha
17:40:00 <pastorn> i hope she gets a tan
17:40:54 <fxr> is it possible to pattern match an empty bytestring?
17:41:00 <Phyx-> heheh
17:41:17 <dafis> fxr: with OverloadedStrings, I think yes
17:41:31 <pastorn> fxr: dafis is correct
17:41:40 <fxr> hmm
17:42:40 <dafis> fxr: or with Data.ByteString.Internal, but using null is to be preferred
17:43:00 <absentia> tryhaskell.org nice!
17:43:02 <fxr> overloadedstrings not worked
17:43:15 <pastorn> fxr: how did you do your matching?
17:43:23 <pastorn> i'm pretty sure i made it work with case bs of
17:43:29 <fxr> ex "" = "emptybs"
17:43:42 <fxr> ex bs = "nonemptybs"
17:43:45 <pastorn> did you give a type signature?
17:43:51 <fxr> sure bs -> string
17:44:00 <pastorn> try with case
17:44:50 <fxr> same
17:45:00 <fxr> No instance for (Data.String.IsString ByteString) arising from the literal ""
17:45:31 <mm_freak> fxr: if it's only the empty string, you can use a guard
17:45:45 <mm_freak> f str | B.null str = …
17:46:15 <fxr> I need to pattern match :( guards will complicate my code
17:46:28 <mm_freak> OverloadedStrings should work
17:46:49 <fxr> :(
17:46:51 <mm_freak> put this as the first line of your code:  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
17:47:08 <fxr> already using it
17:47:20 <EPIBilly> <3 reddit 
17:47:20 <mm_freak> could you paste the code?
17:47:53 <fxr> http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27913#a27913
17:47:55 <dafis> fxr: Data.ByteString.Char8
17:48:05 <fxr> ouch
17:48:15 <mm_freak> ah, lol
17:48:19 <mm_freak> there you go ;)
17:48:19 <fxr> dafis: sure, but I'm using Word8 :(
17:48:33 <mm_freak> you can use both
17:48:43 <mm_freak> import qualified Data.ByteString as B
17:48:48 <mm_freak> import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BC
17:48:54 <dafis> fxr: But the IsString instance isn't defined in Data.BS
17:49:14 <mm_freak> (a qualified import suffices to get the IsString instance)
17:49:29 <fxr> so lemme fix my question, how can I pattern match against an empty strict bytestring and the one which has elements
17:50:17 <fxr> hmm can I use the PS datatype?
17:50:33 <mm_freak> just import .Char8, too
17:50:49 <mm_freak> Data.ByteString.ByteString and Data.ByteString.Char8.ByteString are the same thing
17:50:56 <mm_freak> just the interface is different
17:50:58 <dafis> fxr: what mm_freak said, import both
17:52:08 <dafis> fxr: but really, why not use a guard foo bs | B.null bs = ... ?
17:52:31 <fxr> :) thanks
17:52:31 <joe14323> what is haskell
17:52:44 <mm_freak> because guards can mess up the code, and i agree here
17:52:48 <mm_freak> probably i'd write a real parser =)
17:52:54 <mm_freak> joe14323: a programming language
17:53:00 <joe14323> is it like java?
17:53:02 <mm_freak> in the context of this channel, at least
17:53:10 <joe14323> what is it used for?
17:53:11 <joe14323> coding?
17:53:12 <mm_freak> no
17:53:19 <ivanm> joe14323: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)

17:53:25 <mm_freak> it's a general purpose language, so you can use it for almost anything

17:54:48 <ivanm> yes, if only there was a central place on the internet that contained information on a wide variety of topics, and if only there was another utility that would let you find such sites and also more information on such topics...
17:54:49 <zygotron>   Only unit numeric type pattern is validNot in scope: `unsafeCoerce'
17:55:00 <CakeProphet> :t chr

17:55:08 <CakeProphet> hmmm... interesting.
17:55:12 <CakeProphet> :t ord
17:55:13 <zygotron> Char -> Int
17:55:22 <dafis> ivanm: like an encyclopedia?
17:55:32 <mm_freak> fxr: you could try writing a real parser
17:55:33 <ivanm> dafis: yes, something like a web encyclopedia!
17:55:38 <dafis> I think we could start one
17:55:59 <ivanm> and if people could edit it to add more information rather than relying on a central editing team to do it, that would be even better!
17:56:06 <CakeProphet> ivanm:  but wait, who would have time to develop such an encyclopedia?
17:56:08 <dafis> brilliant idea
17:56:18 <CakeProphet> ivanm:  aha!
17:56:24 <mm_freak> cmdParser = Cmd1 <$ string "cmd1" <|> Cmd2 <$ string "cmd2"
17:56:27 <ivanm> CakeProphet: if it was done by the community, then a large number of people could chip in and help out!
17:56:39 <ivanm> a community encyclopedia if you will
17:56:53 <CakeProphet> but wait a minute, guys.....
17:56:55 <CakeProphet> what's the internet?
17:57:00 <dafis> we could model it on the haskellwiki
17:57:14 <mm_freak> fxr: in general, when you find yourself comparing strings, the more correct/elegant way would be to write a parser or a Read instance =)
17:57:15 <ivanm> CakeProphet: a way for people to use their computers to communicate
17:57:15 <dafis> the internet is a series of tubes?
17:57:19 <ivanm> some pipe dream of mine most likely
17:57:27 <ivanm> dafis: that's its physical manifestation, yes
17:57:38 <mm_freak> but of course, Read doesn't work with ByteString, so you're left with writing a parser ;)
17:58:20 <cantropy> hello, I am trying haskell at step21 http://tryhaskell.com/#21 I wonder how we can get the rest list which is matched by the underscore
17:58:20 <zygotron> Title: Try Haskell! An interactive tutorial in your browser
17:58:23 <CakeProphet> hmmm... why isn't there a generic string typeclass of sorts? too tricky?
17:58:39 <ivanm> cantropy: use an actual variable name rather than an underscore?
17:58:44 <ivanm> CakeProphet: there is
17:58:47 <CakeProphet> Ruby has a tutorial with a web-based REPL
17:58:47 <ivanm> IsString
17:58:53 <ivanm> @src IsString
17:58:54 <zygotron> Source not found. It can only be attributed to human error.
17:58:54 <dafis> cantropy: just give it a name instead of using the underscore
17:58:56 <ivanm> bah
17:59:05 <ivanm> IIRC, it contains the one method: :: String -> a
17:59:05 <mm_freak> ivanm: i wouldn't consider IsString a string class
17:59:10 <ivanm> mm_freak: true
17:59:11 <CakeProphet> ivanm:  ah, but it's not used in standard functions/typeclasses?
17:59:19 <mm_freak> ivanm: a real string class rather implements functions like from Data.List
17:59:22 <ivanm> CakeProphet: to an extent, it's the same reason why FUnctor isn't a superclass of Monad
17:59:34 <ivanm> mm_freak: well, I was going to implement such functionality in container-classes...
17:59:35 <ivanm> ;-)
17:59:41 <ivanm> IIRC, ListLike already has such a class though
17:59:53 <cantropy> ah thank you, I guess the underscore adds clarity when we want to ignore the rest
18:00:01 <mm_freak> ivanm: what is the reason Functor is not a superclass of Monad?
18:00:13 <ivanm> mm_freak: because it wasn't thought of until after the fact?
18:00:25 <ivanm> cantropy: yup, that's the whole point of the underscore
18:00:32 <ivanm> "there's a value here but I dont' really care what it is"
18:00:45 <mm_freak> ivanm: huh?  the Monad class is older than the Functor class?
18:00:53 <ivanm> mm_freak: exactly
18:00:58 <mm_freak> ah, ok
18:01:11 <ivanm> well, IIRC there was apprently a Functor class before Haskell98
18:01:20 <ivanm> but it was then removed to make the language simpler or some such
18:01:45 <mm_freak> well, just like Control.Arrow has been restructured, i think you could restructure Control.Monad and Control.Applicative as well, without breaking too much
18:01:52 <micrypt_> Underscores like Go and Scala. :)
18:02:19 <mm_freak> ivanm: that's probably why we have map and fmap =)
18:02:32 <ivanm> mm_freak: that would break the standard, not to mention possibly breaking some code
18:02:43 <ivanm> and people also want Applicative, etc. in there
18:02:48 <mm_freak> true
18:02:52 <ivanm> it'll probably be restructured in a future Haskell'
18:03:01 <mm_freak> yeah, that would be great
18:03:02 <Tomsik__> Where's haskell++?
18:03:05 <ivanm> i.e. "it's OK to break the old standard, this is the _new_ standard"
18:03:10 <ivanm> Tomsik__: there isn't one...
18:03:14 <ivanm> why would we need one?
18:03:18 <micrypt_> Okay, I'm sold. Great community too, thanks for your help guys.
18:03:26 <ivanm> anyway, that's a list -> list function :p
18:03:30 <ivanm> micrypt_: np
18:03:31 <Eduard_Munteanu> Haskell with a postincrementing operator :P
18:03:38 <mm_freak> Tomsik__: that would be:  runState haskell (sets_ (+1))
18:03:41 <ivanm> Eduard_Munteanu: no, ++ is list concatenation!
18:03:41 <mm_freak> not Haskell++
18:03:47 <jason___> hi
18:03:47 <EDE0000> what is this site
18:03:48 <Eduard_Munteanu> Heh.
18:03:53 <ivanm> mm_freak: are you talking about Haskell'?
18:03:54 <jason___> this is pretty sweet
18:03:54 <EDE0000> did reddit bring u here?
18:03:58 <EDE0000> yeah Haskell
18:04:00 <ivanm> EDE0000: this is an IRC channel...
18:04:01 <jason___> yeah, reddit
18:04:01 <EDE0000> i know what IRC is
18:04:05 <EDE0000> but what is haskell?
18:04:07 <ivanm> EDE0000: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)
18:04:08 <mm_freak> ivanm: i'm talking about: <Tomsik__> Where's haskell++?
18:04:09 <mm_freak> =)
18:04:15 <jason___> what is Haskell?
18:04:18 <ivanm> mm_freak: ugh, that was meant to be to Tomsik__ 
18:04:26 <CakeProphet> whoever asked about Haskell++
18:04:26 <mm_freak> ah, ok =)
18:04:26 <ivanm> Tomsik__: are you talking about Haskell'?
18:04:27 <Llyr> Hey guys. I figured I could either scrounge through the documentation forever, or ask people who knew. Is there a function that takes an integer and tells you how long that integer is as a bit string?
18:04:28 <CakeProphet> there actually is one
18:04:28 <Tomsik__> ivanm: I guess there could be some compatibility-breaking changes that would improve
18:04:32 <CakeProphet> but it's not common at al.
18:04:33 <ivanm> CakeProphet: ugh
18:04:43 <EDE0000> ah i see
18:04:47 <EDE0000> im not a programming monkey
18:04:49 <pikhq> EDE0000: Puroguramu gengo da ze.
18:04:50 <EDE0000> so i dont get this shit
18:04:50 <EDE0000> lol
18:04:52 <ivanm> Llyr: a bit string? you mean the size it takes in RAM?
18:05:04 <Llyr> ivanm: No, I want to know how many bits it takes to represent it.
18:05:04 <mm_freak> Llyr: not a predefined one, but you can easily write one
18:05:06 <jason___> what's a programming
18:05:09 <Saizan> > logBase 2 (fromIntegral 123)
18:05:10 <zygotron>   6.94251450533924
18:05:15 <jason___> and who was phone?
18:05:16 <theorbtwo> Monkies tend not to program Haskell.
18:05:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> I always thought monkeys stuck with Java :P
18:05:28 <Llyr> Saizan: :P
18:05:29 <pikhq> EDE0000: ... Why would one join a programming channel if one does not program?
18:05:30 <EDE0000> lol
18:05:31 <CakeProphet> theorbtwo:  depends on your definition of monkey. :)
18:05:34 <Llyr> saizan: lol
18:05:37 <EDE0000> i wanted to see what this was
18:05:41 <mm_freak> Llyr: length . takeWhile (>0) . iterate (`div` 2)
18:05:42 <EDE0000> i came acros it on reddit
18:05:42 <jason___> me too
18:05:49 <EDE0000> im familiar with IRC
18:05:54 <EDE0000> just didnt know what haskell was
18:05:55 <shapr> Yow! Excitement in Functional Programming!
18:06:03 <CakeProphet> EDE0000:  well, while you're here. Learn how to program Haskell. :)
18:06:05 <pikhq> EDE0000: Apparently you fail at Google.
18:06:06 <jason___> I never  used internet relay chat
18:06:06 <CakeProphet> it's great.
18:06:08 <EDE0000> lol
18:06:13 <EDE0000> indeed i fail at google
18:06:18 <pikhq> Alas.
18:06:28 <EDE0000> i study bizness, not compsci
18:06:34 <EDE0000> i fail at programming
18:06:35 <jason___> let me google that for you
18:06:41 <EDE0000> please dont google that for me
18:06:49 * Eduard_Munteanu remebers a Futurama quote
18:06:51 <jason___> you sure?
18:06:52 <mm_freak> trolls probably
18:06:54 <pikhq> I strongly suggest fixing that.
18:06:57 <shapr> Er, wot?
18:06:59 <etpace> What's the best way to profile for stack overflows? Baring in mind my program usually overflows an hour or two into it, so it's not rapid :\
18:07:00 <EDE0000> dude im not a troll
18:07:01 <jason___> I'm pretty good with the Google
18:07:06 <CakeProphet> @google Haskell
18:07:08 <zygotron> http://www.haskell.org/
18:07:08 <zygotron> Title: Haskell - HaskellWiki
18:07:14 <EDE0000> lol
18:07:21 <shapr> So, is everyone here learning Haskell?
18:07:22 <ivanm> CakeProphet: I already gave him the wikipedia link
18:07:23 <CakeProphet> ...no Google function?
18:07:27 <CakeProphet> shapr:  not at the moment no.
18:07:36 <ivanm> etpace: ouch; sounds like not enough strictness
18:07:43 <pikhq> shapr: Except for the regulars, who know it quite well, thankyouverymuch.
18:07:45 <etpace> yeah
18:07:50 <jason___> what makes Haskell different from all the other programming languages out ther?
18:07:51 <ivanm> if you have an accumulating parameter, you may want some !s or use seq a bit
18:07:56 <IPHAIL> so
18:07:59 <jason___> I'm learning VB for fun
18:08:07 <ivanm> jason___: it's a purely functional language
18:08:09 <shapr> CakeProphet: You already know Haskell?
18:08:12 <CakeProphet> > [1..] --jason___
18:08:13 <zygotron>   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28...
18:08:16 <Eduard_Munteanu> VB?
18:08:16 <pikhq> jason___: Haskell is a statically typed purely functional programming language.
18:08:20 <jason___> I make a mean user interface
18:08:30 <IPHAIL> any of u create a virus from notepad before?
18:08:35 <Eduard_Munteanu> Dude, don't :)
18:08:47 <CakeProphet> shapr:  I mean, depends on your definition of "know", I know it well enough to actually write large programs. I'm working on a project right now. I don't have a lot of experience, but yeah... I'd say I know it well enough.
18:08:48 <mm_freak> could somebody please detroll this channel?
18:08:51 <CakeProphet> still learning, of course.

18:08:58 <Eduard_Munteanu> Okay, there's something wrong today.
18:08:59 <etpace> I have an accumalating parameter that is a map, I have a feeling that this might be the cause
18:09:04 <kmc> mm_freak, it's easy enough to ban all web clients, but i think that'd be bad form
18:09:05 <pikhq> IPHAIL: No; why would I? There's much that's much more amusing out there.
18:09:10 <jason___> Anyone use Simple Basic from Microsoft?
18:09:13 <IPHAIL> lol
18:09:14 <etpace> maps are quite the devil when it comes to mass thunkage
18:09:15 <ivanm> Philippa: we require your anti-trolling pwers again!
18:09:20 <Eduard_Munteanu> What was that reddit URL again?
18:09:20 <dafis> etpace: sounds possible
18:09:22 <mm_freak> kmc: i think, a hostname ban would suffice =)
18:09:22 <IPHAIL> firstly, i apologize if i come off as a troll
18:09:24 <jason___> It's pretty awesome

18:09:59 <IPHAIL> what is this?
18:10:06 <jason___> I just want to learn programming
18:10:07 <shapr> CakeProphet: Ok, if you can write large programs, that's pretty awesome.
18:10:07 <ivanm> IPHAIL: you said you were studying business...
18:10:07 <etpace> I'm using insertWith', but not unionWith'
18:10:09 <Eduard_Munteanu> Oh, it's some tryhaskell.org propaganda that didn't work out well.

18:10:32 <IPHAIL> ivanm, do u have a question?
18:10:35 <ivanm> smoore: if you meant good, the same thing other general purpose programming languages are good for
18:10:35 <Saizan> etpace: you could build with -prof -auto-all and run with +RTS -xc

18:10:44 <ivanm> IPHAIL: how can you be studying business if you're 12?
18:10:46 <mm_freak> this is my personal favorite =)
18:10:48 <Llyr> mm_freak: !!
18:10:49 <Eduard_Munteanu> shapr: um, yeah, you have  a point.
18:10:50 <IPHAIL> lol ivanm
18:10:54 <IPHAIL> obviously it was a joke
18:10:56 <IPHAIL> i'm not 12
18:10:59 <jason___> So haskell is best for number crunching stuff?
18:10:59 <IPHAIL> in case you haven't realized
18:11:04 <Llyr> mm_freak: Bu.. Wha... That's awesome.
18:11:04 <pikhq> mm_freak: Mmm, explicit recursion.
18:11:07 <Saizan> etpace: you'd get the cost centre stack of where the overflow is happening, it might not be so intelligible though
18:11:10 <mm_freak> jason___: haskell is a general purpose language
18:11:12 <CakeProphet> shapr:  well, I exaggerate a bit. I'm /working/ on a large program in my free time. This is much different from being able to crank them out all the time. Most of the questions I ask on this channel are library suggestions and questions about efficiency of various design choices. Things of that nature.
18:11:12 <pikhq> jason___: No, Haskell is best for most things.
18:11:17 <etpace> hmm ok, saizan
18:11:25 <mm_freak> pikhq: sometimes explicit recursion is the natural way
18:11:25 * ivanm gets out of the mad house whilst he still can
18:11:26 <jason___> thanks mm freak and pikhq
18:11:27 <shapr> smoore: Haskell is good for writing computer programs! It has some really nice advantages in the multicore space.
18:11:37 <Arnar> mm_freak: nice one w. fix
18:11:40 <IPHAIL> ok question, anyone here use ubuntu?
18:11:46 <pikhq> mm_freak: Yes.
18:11:50 <shapr> CakeProphet: I've worked on some large Haskell programs in the past, it's exciting.
18:11:57 <shapr> IPHAIL: Yeah, I use Haskell on the latest ubuntu.
18:11:59 <ajax_> what the hell is this
18:12:02 <mm_freak> pikhq: for example there is an iterative definition for gcd, but i'd define it recursively =)

18:12:13 <pikhq> mm_freak: :)
18:12:13 <shapr> ajax_: Looks like a programming channel on irc to me.
18:12:19 <CakeProphet> shapr:  yeah. It's surprisingly easy. Everytime I finish with a session I just make sure my program compiles and I have quite a guarantee of semantic correctness. :)
18:12:26 <ivanm> ajax_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)

18:13:28 <ivanm> hooray for shapr!
18:13:30 <ajax_> AHH SHADDAP YOU DORK
18:13:30 --- kick: ajax_ was kicked by shapr (Kicked by shapr)
18:13:34 <aristid> IPHAIL: in fact, this channel is popular even when it is not reddited.
18:13:38 <ivanm> IPHAIL: 3rd most popular IIRC
18:13:41 <IPHAIL> haha
18:13:44 <aristid> the regular user count is somewhere above 600 iirc
18:13:44 <CakeProphet> wait, I have a solution!
18:13:46 <IPHAIL> what is 1st, 2nd?
18:13:48 <jason___> what is IIRC?
18:13:54 <IPHAIL> THIS IS IT
18:13:55 <aristid> if i recall correctly
18:13:55 <ivanm> IPHAIL: Python and PHP IIRC
18:13:59 <IPHAIL> ah
18:14:07 <Eduard_Munteanu> Interesting, I hanged out in ##electronics before crashing here. :)
18:14:08 <Gracenotes> what not ubuntu?
18:14:08 <CakeProphet> there's a #haskell-blah, for off-topic conversation. Perhaps some people should move there.
18:14:10 <aristid> ##c++ is big too, but smaller than 
18:14:12 <theorbtwo> jason___: JFGI.  (That's Just Fine Google It.)
18:14:13 <IPHAIL> i actually didnt realize IRC was a chatroom for programmers
18:14:13 <aristid> #haskell
18:14:27 <ivanm> CakeProphet: noooo!!!! don't tell them that!
18:14:30 <aristid> IPHAIL: well that's not quite true.
18:14:31 <jason___> what does... oh, I see what you did there
18:14:36 <shapr> IPHAIL: Yup, lots of programmers hanging out on IRC. You looking for any particular programming language?
18:14:36 <aristid> but it's close.
18:14:43 <Gracenotes> IRC is a lot of things. but freenode centers around open source projects.
18:14:43 <CakeProphet> ivanm:  it would divert spam to another channel wouldn't it?
18:14:46 <Phyx->  /win 7
18:14:50 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL: Well, there are many chat rooms on IRC for programmers.  (Though the term "channel" is prefered to "chat room".)
18:14:51 <IPHAIL> #haskell-blah?
18:14:54 --- mode: ChanServ set +o ivanm
18:14:55 <IPHAIL> lol
18:14:59 <IPHAIL> is that troll-friendly?
18:15:00 <ivanm> CakeProphet: except some of us are using it as a refuge from the madhouse here!
18:15:01 <jason___> I like this place already
18:15:03 <ivanm> shapr: :o
18:15:06 <pastorn> spam wednesday?
18:15:09 <shapr> ivanm: You've got the power!
18:15:09 <ivanm> shapr: I was just about to head off though...
18:15:10 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  no, but it's non-Haskell-discussion friendly.
18:15:11 <jason___> mmm spa,
18:15:15 <IPHAIL> haha
18:15:16 <jason___> spam
18:15:23 <pastorn> noone told me
18:15:25 <pastorn> :(
18:15:28 <shapr> IPHAIL: I talked about unicycles too much in #haskell, thus #haskell-blah was started :-/
18:15:32 <mm_freak> (i've found that in general just banning without kicking is much more effective)
18:15:34 <IPHAIL> just so i dont feel left out here, who ELSE doesn't know shit about programming?
18:15:34 <zygoloid> say goodnight, zygotron
18:15:46 <pikhq> IPHAIL: Uh. Hardly anyone.
18:15:49 <jason___> me!
18:15:58 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  everyone else who just appeared with you.
18:15:58 <Eduard_Munteanu> Mmm, maybe it would have been a better idea to direct people to #tryhaskell or something and have some volunteers join there.
18:15:59 <pastorn> what is this? the troll twins?
18:16:03 <pikhq> Most of the people here know Haskell or are intending to learn it.
18:16:05 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL, jason___ : If you don't know shit about programming, and don't want to, please leave.
18:16:05 <shapr> IPHAIL: We've had lots of folks show up here knowing nothing, hang around for a few months, and then they knew something!
18:16:11 <ivanm> shapr: yes, but it would have been nice to have the power a while back, not when I'm about to leave!
18:16:12 <Eduard_Munteanu> pastorn: no, it's the tryhaskell stuff on reddit
18:16:14 <jason___> I am using SimpleBasic from M$
18:16:16 <shapr> ivanm: awww
18:16:16 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: good idea.
18:16:17 <ivanm> (especially since I don't know how to use the power)
18:16:21 <pastorn> Eduard_Munteanu: ah, cool
18:16:28 <zygoloid> sorry to leave you guys without a lambdabot but i can't sleep with this computer on ;(
18:16:29 <shapr> ivanm: It comes with directions, unlike life.
18:16:29 <Tomsik__> Eduard_Munteanu: like, one-way ticket?
18:16:31 <aristid> pastorn: tryhaskell.org has a chat feature
18:16:33 <theorbtwo> If you want to learn Haskell, we'll be glad to help.
18:16:34 <jason___> and just upgraded to the free VB and C++ stuff
18:16:34 <shapr> zygoloid: Aw, thanks!
18:16:37 <tehgeekmeister> anyone know how one gets strings into attributes in blazehtml?  not string literals, mind you;; those work.
18:16:38 <tehgeekmeister> ?
18:16:48 <IPHAIL> any of u guys work in IT atm?
18:16:54 <CakeProphet> zygoloid:  no lambdabot!!!?
18:16:55 <Eduard_Munteanu> Tomsik__: heh, we're sold out at the moment :P
18:16:56 <IPHAIL> maybe for apple? microsoft? dell?
18:16:59 <dafis> zygoloid: good night
18:17:01 <IPHAIL> ibm?
18:17:10 <theorbtwo> The site does guide you through a bit before it introduces the "chat" command, BTW.
18:17:23 <aristid> IPHAIL: if you continue listing every company you can think of, maybe you'll get a hit
18:17:27 <jason___> International Business Machines
18:17:28 <IPHAIL> lol
18:17:29 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL: Most people working in IT don't work for big-name computer compinies.
18:17:33 <jason___> I just googled it
18:17:34 <Phyx-> theorbtwo: yeah, but someone probably posted the chat comment in the comments
18:17:35 <pastorn> aristid: no it doesn't... at least i can't find the chat function :(
18:17:37 <ivanm> @google haskell industry
18:17:37 <zygoloid> good night #haskell. good night reddit. :)
18:17:41 <aristid> pastorn: type chat
18:17:42 <shapr> zygoloid: g'nite!
18:17:49 <jason___> so what do you guys talk about mostly in Haskell?
18:17:51 <pastorn> haha
18:17:57 <shapr> jason___: I talk about web programming.
18:18:00 <theorbtwo> pastorn: It's in step7.
18:18:02 <Phyx-> pastorn: step 6
18:18:04 <etpace> spaceleak pains
18:18:08 <jason___> web programming? cool
18:18:10 <LAWLZMYBALLZ> lolz
18:18:18 <IPHAIL> are u guys all experts in Excel?
18:18:18 <pikhq> jason___: StateT s (Cont r)
18:18:27 <pastorn> ok, that was fun
18:18:27 <IPHAIL> i could really brush up my excel
18:18:28 <Phyx-> jason___: unsafePerformIO
18:18:29 <aristid> IPHAIL: in _excel_?!
18:18:30 <IPHAIL> for financial modelling
18:18:30 <ivanm> IPHAIL: I for one try to avoid excel...
18:18:32 <jason___> so you can use Haskell to program your own webpage.
18:18:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> They should probably make you write a histozygomorphic prepromorphism that folds what you say into #haskell instead of just 'chat' :P
18:18:52 <aristid> jason___: if you're ery smart, yes.
18:18:53 <mm_freak> pikhq: so far i found ContT r (StateT s) more convenient =)
18:19:04 <pikhq> mm_freak: Yes, yes, but the time travel monad!
18:19:05 <pastorn> this is *way* too much chatter for me... i can't keep up
18:19:13 <aristid> only smart people are allowed to use haskell.
18:19:16 <mm_freak> pikhq: ah, ok
18:19:17 <jason___> StateT s (Cont r) & unsafePerformIO are things I've never heard of
18:19:23 <IPHAIL> brb
18:19:24 <pikhq> IPHAIL: Excel is comically limited.
18:19:28 <IPHAIL> lol
18:19:31 <IPHAIL> excel is the shit
18:19:33 <IPHAIL> its so powerful
18:19:35 <IPHAIL> it can do almost anything
18:19:39 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL: You going into here and talking about excel is like me going into a the common room for MBA students at your university and saying that you must sell a lot of lemonade by the side of the road.
18:19:41 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: with a monoidal endofunctor?
18:19:41 <pikhq> Hahahahahah. No.
18:19:48 <mm_freak> IPHAIL: brainfuck can do almost anything, too
18:19:53 <Phyx-> oh god... is there a mute button..
18:19:56 <jason___> oh, I know Excel
18:20:02 <pikhq> mm_freak: More than Excel, for that matter.
18:20:07 <etpace> Can anybody explain when and when not to use the INLINE and UNPACK pragmas? I'm sprinkling them liberally, and sometimes its a massive win and sometimes its just add space for nothing
18:20:10 <Eduard_Munteanu> aristid: I'm thinking comonadic OI into IRC.
18:20:10 <pikhq> Last I checked, Excel wasn't TC.
18:20:13 <pastorn> /ignore IPHAIL jason___
18:20:16 <pikhq> (well, modula VBA)
18:20:19 <Eduard_Munteanu> :P
18:20:28 <jason___> oh? ok
18:20:34 <pastorn> hehe
18:20:35 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: the natural transformation extract might come in handy
18:20:38 <mm_freak> pikhq: no, only the table resolving algorithm is not TC
18:20:42 <CakeProphet> pikhq:  I have attempted to write a bf interpreter in Excel, with little success.
18:20:49 <mm_freak> but a cell can contain programs in a TC language
18:20:52 <mm_freak> (VBA)
18:20:55 <aristid> CakeProphet: you must use teh VBA for that.
18:20:56 <IPHAIL> excel is very important in bizniz
18:21:02 <pikhq> mm_freak: Thus "modulo VBA".
18:21:14 <mm_freak> =)
18:21:15 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  but not in #haskell ;)
18:21:15 <pastorn> IPHAIL: haskell is very good in busyness
18:21:23 <IPHAIL> haha tru
18:21:27 <IPHAIL> i'll keep that in mind
18:21:28 <Phyx-> mm_freak: well, can't you also call native functions, so C and C++ too :P
18:21:28 <aristid> IPHAIL: haskell is way more powerful than excel.
18:21:36 <pikhq> IPHAIL: Yes, yes, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and other such toys are highly important in business.
18:21:38 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL: Sure.  Selling lemonade is very important in childhood.  We just don't care.
18:21:42 <ivanm> aristid: arguably brainfuck is way more powerful than excel...
18:21:48 <IPHAIL> can haskell do my taxes?
18:21:52 <mm_freak> Phyx-: yes, but VBA is already sufficient =)
18:21:56 <Tomsik__> I think both are turing-complete aristid 
18:21:56 <ivanm> IPHAIL: if you program it to do so, then yes
18:21:58 <aristid> ivanm: can brainfuck sole matrixes?!
18:22:06 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  no, but you can write a program to do your taxes with it.
18:22:08 <Eduard_Munteanu> @faq Can haskell do IPHAIL's taxes?
18:22:08 <ivanm> IPHAIL: there are at least two accounting applications written in haskell...
18:22:09 <pastorn> @faq can haskell do IPHAILs taxes?
18:22:11 <pikhq> aristid: Yes.
18:22:13 <mm_freak> btw, excel allows you to /express/ any program, even for its table resolution algorithm
18:22:15 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ha :)
18:22:15 <pastorn> boooooooooooooo
18:22:18 <mm_freak> but it will refuse to run it =)
18:22:21 <jason___> Can I get Haskell to do my math homework?
18:22:23 <theorbtwo> (Actually, I disagree, selling lemonade is terribly unimportant in childhood.)
18:22:25 <aristid> pikhq: now you have a mission.
18:22:26 <ivanm> aristid: I'm sure you could extend it to add matrix support if you're masochistic enough... ;-)
18:22:28 <jason___> I hate algebra... takes forever
18:22:29 <pikhq> <lambdabot> The answer is: YES! Haskell can do that!
18:22:36 <IPHAIL> can haskell find me a girlfriend? 
18:22:37 <pastorn> pikhq: thank you
18:22:39 <mm_freak> @faq can haskell do your homework?
18:22:41 <pastorn> for forwarding that
18:22:44 <pikhq> <lambdabot> The answer is: YES! Haskell can do that!
18:22:46 <mm_freak> ok, lambdabot is missing
18:22:48 <aristid> ivanm: well you can always simulate it with a few... uh, + and [ and...
18:22:52 <IPHAIL> haskell can find me true love?
18:22:57 <IPHAIL> now we're talkin
18:22:57 <theorbtwo> jason___: Sure.  Of course, it'd probably be far easier to just do your math homework.
18:23:03 <jason___> This Haskell sounds pretty sweet
18:23:09 <pastorn> IPHAIL: your true love is HaskellLove
18:23:12 <jason___> well I get the concepts
18:23:13 <IPHAIL> lol
18:23:20 <Arnar> mm_freak: I never had "find a girlfriend" as homework..
18:23:25 <jason___> it just takes FOREVER to do 50 problems of the same thing
18:23:31 <IPHAIL> jason, u in college?
18:23:36 <mm_freak> Arnar: but there is probably an arrow for that
18:23:37 <mm_freak> or a monad
18:23:44 <pikhq> jason___: Yeah, well, c'est la vie.
18:23:45 <jason___> no, I am actually 12
18:23:46 <Tomsik__> jason___: on your level, you need just ten fingers
18:23:48 <IPHAIL> actually out of curiousity...who here is IN college? and who here has graduated?
18:24:04 <Tomsik__> You, of course, IPHAIL 
18:24:06 <CakeProphet> jason___:  it would probably take longer to design the computer algebra system to solve the 50 problems. But if you make it then you'll save lots of time in the future... if you pursue a career in college algebra.
18:24:06 <jason___> but I tested into MENSA
18:24:12 <mm_freak> anyway
18:24:13 <aristid> IPHAIL: i don't think you want 656 answers.
18:24:22 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  college here.
18:24:25 <jason___> awesome
18:24:27 <IPHAIL> half of you are probably comp sci students who are really bored
18:24:29 <mm_freak> shapr: could you please get rid of the trolls?
18:24:36 <pikhq> jason___: MENSA? Cute.
18:24:36 <pastorn> IPHAIL: aren't you?
18:24:39 <Tomsik__> IPHAIL: well, I'm more than really bored right now
18:24:39 <IPHAIL> im not a troll
18:24:42 <IPHAIL> i am in college, yes
18:24:48 <etpace> in college too
18:24:48 <jason___> what is a troll?
18:24:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> What's college to you? University?
18:24:55 <pikhq> mm_freak: I don't think jason's a troll, just young.
18:24:56 <IPHAIL> yes university
18:24:58 <etpace> well yeah, university :p
18:24:58 <mm_freak> i'm not sure whether jason___ is one, but IPHAIL
18:24:59 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah.
18:24:59 <pastorn> IPHAIL: studying what?
18:25:03 <IPHAIL> i figure most of u are probably American?
18:25:05 <mm_freak> pikhq: yeah
18:25:08 <IPHAIL> so dont u guys refer to it as college?
18:25:10 <IPHAIL> I'm canadian
18:25:12 <IPHAIL> dont hate
18:25:16 <pastorn> <-- swede
18:25:18 <jason___> Yeah, I'm American
18:25:20 <aristid> no, most people here are not american
18:25:20 <IPHAIL> I study Finance & Economics
18:25:21 <etpace> uk, call it university
18:25:24 <etpace> college is 16-18
18:25:26 <Tomsik__> IPHAIL: haha, bieber
18:25:29 <IPHAIL> lol
18:25:33 <IPHAIL> hate j bieber
18:25:35 <Eduard_Munteanu> I'm Romanian, so I tend to get these things mixed up :)
18:25:35 <IPHAIL> kid can go die
18:25:38 <theorbtwo> I'm an American expat living in the UK.
18:25:52 <pikhq> There's a curious lot of CS guys in Scandinavia. And quite a few in the rest of Europe, for that matter.
18:25:54 <mm_freak> i'm living in germany
18:25:57 <pastorn> IPHAIL: or he can go to North Korea. Which is BEST KOREA.
18:25:59 <CakeProphet> Eduard_Munteanu:  "college" generally refers to university in America at least.
18:26:01 <jason___> Mys sister loves him... hate the guy. She is 14
18:26:03 <IPHAIL> haha
18:26:07 <Eduard_Munteanu> I see.
18:26:12 <Llyr> :t iterate
18:26:14 <Llyr> Oh boo.
18:26:20 <IPHAIL> Ok guys. show of hands. Who here has pre-ordered SC2?
18:26:21 <Llyr> Our lambdabot died.
18:26:22 <pastorn> @type iterate
18:26:22 <mm_freak> Llyr: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
18:26:29 <etpace> Chalmers perhaps pikhq 
18:26:30 <pikhq> <lambdabot>iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
18:26:34 <Arnar> pastorn: where in sweden?
18:26:39 <Tomsik__> IPHAIL: are you a dinosaur?
18:26:40 <pastorn> Arnar: Göteborg
18:26:45 <Arnar> pastorn: Chalmers?
18:26:47 <IPHAIL> lol what u talking about
18:26:48 <pastorn> ajjemen
18:26:56 <mm_freak> Llyr: it takes a function and applies it repeatedly to an argument, producing a list of results
18:27:00 <IPHAIL> Tomsik, why would i be a dinosaur
18:27:06 <jason___> he is
18:27:11 <jason___> rawr!
18:27:13 <Tomsik__> because that's when SC2 was released
18:27:14 <Llyr> Ok.
18:27:18 <mm_freak> Llyr: 
18:27:19 <Llyr> mm_freak: Thank you sir.
18:27:21 <mm_freak> > take 10 $ iterate (subtract 2) 5
18:27:21 <mm_freak> [5,3,1,-1,-3,-5,-7,-9,-11,-13]
18:27:21 <jason___> ^-^
18:27:26 <dafis> Tomsik__: what *is* SC2?
18:27:31 <IPHAIL> SC2 isnt out yet
18:27:34 <IPHAIL> i dunno what ur talking about
18:27:35 <pastorn> Arnar: /arnarb
18:27:52 <Arnar> pastorn: that's me
18:27:53 <pastorn> Arnar: Never logged in. No mail. No plan.
18:27:54 <CakeProphet> dafis:  Starcraft 2. PC game.
18:27:57 <pastorn> bleak future, i say
18:27:57 <Tomsik__> dafis: star control 2
18:27:59 <Eduard_Munteanu> In fact iterate makes it so the place in the list corresponds to the number of times the function is reapplied to the arg.
18:28:00 <IPHAIL> lol
18:28:01 <theorbtwo> starcraft 2.  Massively multiplayer realtime strategy game.  It's in very open beta, IIRC.
18:28:02 <Tomsik__> oh
18:28:03 <jason___> this isn't programming
18:28:04 <IPHAIL> Star Craft 2
18:28:08 <aristid> IPHAIL: don't ask about SC2. ask about "folds".
18:28:10 <pastorn> ok
18:28:14 <CakeProphet> theorbtwo:  not MM, btw.
18:28:18 <CakeProphet> but online, yes.
18:28:21 <pikhq> aristid: Praise be to lambda!
18:28:23 <pastorn> any non-haskell bullshit is what #haskell-blah is for
18:28:30 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: useful connection =)
18:28:35 * dafis is too old for stupid n-th person shooters
18:28:36 <pastorn> so if you wanna talk SC2 do it there plz
18:28:43 <aristid> pikhq: And the bot of Lambda.
18:28:47 <jason___> www.tryhaskell.org is pretty cool though. 
18:28:50 <jason___> thanks guys
18:28:58 <jason___> or girls...
18:29:00 <jason___> or whatever!
18:29:06 <mm_freak> mostly guys i guess
18:29:20 <Saizan> all made by chrisdone :)
18:29:35 <mm_freak> there was a pseudo-survey on the haskell-cafe about female haskell programmers
18:29:42 <IPHAIL> ok
18:29:53 <mm_freak> i didn't like it, but it indicated that there aren't many (although not none)
18:30:06 <jason___> I don't know many girls that use computers for anything but Facebook
18:30:12 <jason___> email
18:30:20 <mm_freak> yeah, most wouldn't even use email =)
18:30:32 <IPHAIL> I HAVE A GREAT IDEA! LETS ALL ADD EACH OTHER ON FACEBOOK :D :D :D :D
18:30:39 <jason___> I like the idea of you being in control of the computer
18:30:47 <jason___> telling it what to do and being the boss
18:30:50 * pikhq doesn't even *have* a Facebook account
18:30:55 <jason___> instead of just playing gams all day
18:30:58 * dafis neither
18:30:59 <mm_freak> i have, but i'm not using it
18:31:00 <jason___> *games*
18:31:03 <IPHAIL> woah, u dont have facebook?
18:31:08 <Eduard_Munteanu> pikhq: "so that means we're not friends?" :P
18:31:11 <IPHAIL> damn, that is some serious dedication to programming right there
18:31:14 <dafis> no, why would I?
18:31:16 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL:  facebook, btw, is also off-topic.
18:31:20 <jason___> I do, but mom doesn't let me add people
18:31:25 <jason___> without her checking first
18:31:28 <aristid> jason___: yes, being in control of the computer feels nice.
18:31:35 <mm_freak> hmm
18:31:45 <pikhq> Why would I? It's pointless. Quite unlike compilers.
18:31:45 <mm_freak> the notion of "friend" must be undefined for you, if you don't have a facebook account
18:31:58 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah, seriously, I don't have one either.
18:32:04 <aristid> pikhq: haha, compilers are pointful, most of them
18:32:08 <tolkad> what symbol should represent cross product?
18:32:12 <jason___> no time or no friends?
18:32:14 <mm_freak> because:  isFriend :: Monad m => User -> User -> FacebookT m Bool
18:32:15 <dafis> mm_freak: I'm old-fashioned, friends are people you meet in flesh
18:32:17 <aristid> a pointfree dialect of haskell would be quite hard to use
18:32:17 <tolkad> well, I guess *
18:32:33 <tolkad> what about dot product?
18:32:33 <pikhq> aristid: :D
18:32:41 <mm_freak> but…
18:32:49 <mm_freak> pointOfThisConversation :: forall a. a
18:32:51 <tolkad> that's more like Vector -> Vector -> Double
18:33:04 <theorbtwo> aristid: Plenty of people seem to use a point-free dialect of Haskell all the time.
18:33:07 <tolkad> hmm, I can't use a . that's taken
18:33:08 <jason___> vectors are directions, right?
18:33:15 <tolkad> jason___: direction + magnitude
18:33:15 <mm_freak> obviously there is no pointOfThisDiscussion =)
18:33:15 <theorbtwo> Ironicly, it uses (.) a lot.
18:33:17 <CakeProphet> aristid:  a pointfree-only Haskell would actually have difficulty without primitives, I'm pretty sure. For example, how would you define "flip" in pointfree style?
18:33:30 <jason___> thank tolkad
18:33:33 <mm_freak> CakeProphet: you only need S and K
18:33:45 <aristid> unlambda is pointfree?
18:33:52 <mm_freak> CakeProphet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK_combinator_calculus
18:33:52 <tolkad> jason___: They can represent something like a force, a velocity, or a spacial coordinate
18:33:59 <Tomsik__> Better, there's one combinator that is enough
18:34:00 <CakeProphet> mm_freak:  ah yes. 
18:34:04 <Eduard_Munteanu> Flip?
18:34:06 <Tomsik__> don't remember its name
18:34:11 <Eduard_Munteanu> Well it's trivial in pointful.
18:34:12 <aristid> mm_freak: does reading Mock a Mockingbird help with that stuff? :D
18:34:23 <jason___> cool. math is really useful for programming
18:34:28 <IPHAIL__> ok
18:34:32 <IPHAIL__> i forget the off topic channel
18:34:35 <IPHAIL__> can someone say it again
18:34:38 <aristid> IPHAIL: #haskell-blah
18:34:41 <IPHAIL__> k thx
18:34:42 <theorbtwo> #haskell-blah
18:34:42 <mm_freak> aristid: probably =)
18:34:52 <pikhq> jason___: Arguably, programming is a form of mathematics.
18:34:57 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah, now I see, sorry.
18:35:02 <pastorn> IPHAIL__: you're already in #haskell-blah
18:35:08 <IPHAIL__> lol
18:35:12 <IPHAIL__> dont think so
18:35:18 <jason___> I could see it, but I don't know that much of either :)
18:35:21 <drbean> Is Mock a Mockingbird about all the combinators?
18:35:26 <IPHAIL__> or has this turned into haskell-blah 0_o
18:35:28 <aristid> mm_freak: const is the kestrel and id is the identity bird :D
18:35:38 <IPHAIL__> lol
18:35:41 <theorbtwo> Haskell is a very math-ish view of programming.
18:35:42 <IPHAIL__> hello IPHAILHARDER
18:35:51 <jason___> how do you make that little *beep* when you send a comment directly to me?
18:35:51 <pastorn> IPHAIL__: just klick on the #haskell-blah box on top of this text window
18:35:54 <aristid> drbean: dunno, it doesn't say it so clearly because everything is packed into the story
18:35:56 <IPHAIL__> type in the name
18:36:04 <aristid> with little connection to the actual math behind it
18:36:08 <jason___> IPHAIL__
18:36:13 <IPHAIL__> hi
18:36:14 <jason___> did it beep you?
18:36:16 <IPHAIL__> yes
18:36:18 <IPHAIL__> its annoying
18:36:19 <Eduard_Munteanu> I'm curious, who made that tryhaskell stuff and posted it to reddit?
18:36:20 <IPHAIL__> now stop
18:36:24 <jason___> ok
18:36:25 <IPHAIL__> lol
18:36:26 <theorbtwo> jason___: The person talking to you doesn't make a beep.  Your client does.
18:36:26 <IPHAIL__> dunno
18:36:29 <IPHAIL__> just check the link
18:36:32 <IPHAIL__> and see the user
18:36:39 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: chrisdone made tryhaskell, i don't know who posted it to reddit
18:36:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah.
18:36:47 <jason___> theorbtwo thanks!
18:37:05 <IPHAIL__> Mac or PC? (i'm in the laptop market right now and looking)
18:37:26 <Eduard_Munteanu> I sure hope it's using lambdabot, I was considering having a try at messing with it :P
18:37:29 <jason___> Mac are for girls
18:37:29 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  I recommend #haskell-blah  ....again.
18:37:35 <aristid> IPHAIL__: again, ask this in #haskell-blah
18:38:00 <jason___> oh, sorry
18:38:02 <IPHAIL__> sorry guys
18:38:03 <theorbtwo> Eduard_Munteanu: I assume not, since it's working and lambdabot isn't.
18:38:17 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: it uses mueval AFAIK
18:38:18 <IPHAIL__> ok, this is a semi-programming related question
18:38:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> theorbtwo: I mean the lambdabot stuff that's in Cabal too.
18:38:26 <aristid> Eduard_Munteanu: lambdabot uses an adapted version of mueval
18:38:28 <IPHAIL__> I need to mask my IP, how can i do this?
18:38:29 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  alright. :)
18:38:30 <Eduard_Munteanu> aristid: ah, then it's probably safe.
18:38:32 <IPHAIL__> without the user of a web proxy
18:38:35 <IPHAIL__> use*
18:38:43 <IPHAIL__> or a VPN
18:38:47 <IPHAIL__> any free ways of doing this?
18:38:58 <aristid> IPHAIL__: again, #haskell-blah
18:39:00 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  a question about "computers" isn't a question about programming in Haskell.
18:39:00 <theorbtwo> IPHAIL__: Ask on -blah.
18:39:01 <Tomsik__> IPHAIL__: Well, you can try using freenet.
18:39:05 <IPHAIL__> lol
18:39:10 <IPHAIL__> freenet?
18:39:15 <IPHAIL__> is that a webproxy...
18:39:19 <Tomsik__> Nope.
18:39:21 <pastorn> IPHAIL__: click on the #haskell-blah box on the top of the chat window!
18:39:28 <IPHAIL__> i dont see it
18:39:30 <kiddo> what is haskell?
18:39:31 <IPHAIL__> its not there
18:39:36 <Eduard_Munteanu> No way...
18:39:41 <aristid> kiddo: ask wikipedia
18:39:47 <jason___> I You should go back to the lessons
18:39:57 <Eduard_Munteanu> kiddo: it's a functional programming language.
18:39:58 <jason___> I'm on sorting now IPHAIL__
18:40:04 <IPHAIL__> i see a bunch of links
18:40:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> kiddo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)
18:40:15 <kiddo> Thank you
18:40:16 <jeffhill> I've got a naieve Haskell question:  Why does (foldr1 (\a b -> if a >= b then a else b) [ x * y | x <- [100..999], y <- [100..x]]) blow the stack?
18:40:24 <jason___> what's so functional about it?
18:40:43 <jesusabdullah> kiddo: How did you get here, if you didn't know what haskell was?
18:40:49 <kiddo> Wikipedia's been removed
18:40:59 <aristid> jason___: that's actually not a very easy question :)
18:41:01 <IPHAIL__> thoughts on 4chan?
18:41:03 <mm_freak> jeffhill: try foldl1
18:41:05 <IPHAIL__> lol or off topic?
18:41:07 <Eduard_Munteanu> jesusabdullah: there's that tryhaskell stuff that's been posted on reddit.
18:41:10 <aristid> IPHAIL__: off topic, yes.
18:41:11 <jason___> I got here from REDDIT
18:41:17 <kiddo> I stumbled across it on reddit
18:41:17 <jesusabdullah> Huh
18:41:21 <jason___> thanks aristid
18:41:21 <jesusabdullah> Crazy
18:41:22 <Saizan> IPHAIL__: type /join #haskell-blah if you want to go there
18:41:30 <jesusabdullah> Buddy of mine turned me onto haskell
18:41:30 <IPHAIL__> ok
18:41:32 <mm_freak> jeffhill: and as a side note:  \a b -> if a >= b then a else b === max
18:41:33 <g_cross> @source foldr1
18:41:33 <jason___> reading the Wiki right now
18:41:44 <mm_freak> jeffhill: foldl1 max [ … ]
18:41:52 <jesusabdullah> and funny enough, I *still* haven't done anything past a touch of tryhaskell...but I am learning some fp paradigms!
18:42:04 <IPHAIL__> Yay justin bieber!
18:42:04 <IPHAIL__> http://i.imgur.com/daCfE.jpg
18:42:08 <pikhq> jesusabdullah: Fix that man. :D
18:42:12 <jeffhill> mm_freak: foldl1 also blows the stack.  Yeah, I started with (maximum [list comprehension]) and tried different things to get here.
18:42:15 <drbean> http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/index.htm "connects the dots" between the birds and the combinators.
18:42:23 <aristid> shapr: you still here?
18:42:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah. I kept seeing Haskell around, but took a closer look only when I saw some post on a developer's blog (a guy I worked with).
18:42:27 <CakeProphet> jesusabdullah:  familiar with Real World Haskell and Learn You a Haskell?
18:42:38 <jmcarthur> IPHAIL__: if you don't get back on topic or keep quiet you can't stay here
18:42:39 <jason___> HAHAHA IPHAIL__
18:42:43 <g_cross> @src foldr1
18:42:45 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: well, simple guess would be laziness creating a huge expression
18:42:53 <Eduard_Munteanu> Until you take a closer look, it seems like another cheap programming language. :)
18:42:56 <Tomsik__> I mean, it's about 400 000 of calls
18:43:01 <Tomsik__> enough to blow up callstack
18:43:02 <IPHAIL__> ok jmcarther, chill out
18:43:14 <jason___> fp paradigms
18:43:14 <mm_freak> jeffhill: i don't see why it should blow the stack, but note that the list you're asking for the maximum of is quite large
18:43:15 <g_cross> Grr, my lambdabot foo is weak.
18:43:24 <g_cross> How do I get lambdabot to print the source of foldr1?
18:43:27 <Eduard_Munteanu> I mean, a lot of other languages can look like that.
18:43:36 <dafis> jeffhill: use foldl'
18:43:38 <jeffhill> Oh, perhaps I don't understand Haskell laziness; I thought it was like Clojure where I could make infinite lists and have them eval out?
18:43:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> g_cross: it isn't working ATM.
18:43:48 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  no, I think most of this channel agrees with him. No need for him to chill out.
18:44:00 <jmcarthur> CakeProphet: leave him be. he got the point
18:44:04 <g_cross> jeffhill:  Anyway, the problem is that foldr1 recursively descends until it hits the end of the list, and then works its way back.
18:44:09 <IPHAIL__> no love for me :(
18:44:16 <dafis> jeffhill: foldl will not evaluate max at each step, so it'll build a huge thunk
18:44:19 <mm_freak> jeffhill: maybe you should get a more recent GHC, because it works well for me even in GHCi
18:44:20 <IPHAIL__> perhaps the python channel will love me
18:44:23 <mm_freak> > maximum [ x * y | x <- [100..999], y <- [100..x] ]
18:44:23 <mm_freak> 998001
18:44:26 <aristid> drbean: thanks
18:44:28 <jmcarthur> IPHAIL__: you're welcome to stay if you wish. we just have rules, that's all :)
18:44:34 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  doubtful. #python will not be as nice as #haskell.
18:44:38 <jeffhill> mm_freak: I'm on 6.12.1
18:44:39 <IPHAIL__> lol
18:44:45 <IPHAIL__> brb while i go troll #python
18:44:49 <mm_freak> hmm, same version here
18:44:51 <IPHAIL__> anyone wanna come watch?
18:44:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> Now now, we'll be stuck with him.
18:44:58 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: are you doing some euler here? ;)
18:45:04 <dafis> jeffhill: 6.12.1 shouldn't get a stack overflow for that
18:45:05 <jeffhill> dafis: So foldl' is the efficient fold on infinite forms?
18:45:12 <jmcarthur> Eduard_Munteanu: what is this "stuck" you speak of? ;)
18:45:20 <g_cross> Eduard_Munteanu:  Thanks, now I feel better.  :-)
18:45:25 <dafis> jeffhill: no, foldl and foldl' only work on finite lists
18:45:36 <jeffhill> Tomsik__: Yeah, I find the first few problems great for learning the basic forms of languages that are new to me.
18:45:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> jmcarthur: well, since CakeProphet made it clear we're friendlier... :)
18:45:53 <Guest27830> mikey_newbie
18:45:54 <jeffhill> dafis: Oh, right, I meant potentially large (stack exploding) lists.
18:45:55 <Tomsik__> Prelude> foldr1 (\a b -> if a >= b then a else b) [ x * y | x <- [100..999], y <- [100..x]]
18:45:55 <Tomsik__> 998001
18:45:59 <CakeProphet> dafis:  all of Haskell is lazily evaluated. foldl, by its nature, simply won't terminate on an infinite list. So you can't really "fold" an infinite list.
18:46:04 <jmcarthur> Eduard_Munteanu: if he manages to stick around without getting kicked then he's alright
18:46:05 <dafis> jeffhill: for infinite lists, you need foldr and a function lazy in the second argument
18:46:10 <mm_freak> jeffhill: foldl' is the left fold…  its evaluation semantics don't use the stack a lot, but instead they use the heap (unless you use foldl')
18:46:16 <jason___> do they make any video games with Haskell?
18:46:21 <IPHAIL__> how come i cant join #python?
18:46:29 <jmcarthur> jason___: i'm working on one
18:46:30 <IPHAIL__> says i need to be identified with services
18:46:31 <Eduard_Munteanu> jmcarthur: yeah. He's been messing around a bit though. I sure hope nice people stick around.
18:46:48 <jmcarthur> IPHAIL__: #python clearly is trolled often enough to justify that
18:46:49 <jason___> because you're a "troll" IPHAIL__
18:46:54 <Eduard_Munteanu> IPHAIL__: you need to create an account with NickServ.
18:47:01 <jason___> You are working on a video game jmcarthur? Cool
18:47:04 <Eduard_Munteanu> IPHAIL__: type /quote nickserv
18:47:07 <IPHAIL__> ah
18:47:08 <Eduard_Munteanu> IPHAIL__: then type help
18:47:12 <IPHAIL__> luckily i have a user with IRC
18:47:16 <IPHAIL__> i created back in the day
18:47:18 <mm_freak> hey, ops
18:47:22 <mm_freak> this really is starting to suck
18:47:23 <IPHAIL__> when i used IRC to discuss stuff with friends
18:47:25 <jason___> using this IIRL is almost like having to learn to program
18:47:28 <mm_freak> please clean this channel up
18:47:28 <jmcarthur> IPHAIL__: last chance
18:47:30 <jason___> *IIRC
18:47:33 <IPHAIL__> sry boss
18:48:05 <jason___> I think that it would be cool to learn to program with a video game
18:48:06 <CakeProphet> IPHAIL__:  IRC is not a centralized chat server. There are many different servers. So you need to register with freenode's nickserv.
18:48:13 <aristid> jason___: having to learn program? if you're forced to learn programming, you will not learn it. programming can only be learned voluntarily.
18:48:14 <IPHAIL__> oh
18:48:16 <IPHAIL__> i see
18:48:17 <g_cross> I don't think that jeffhill's problem is just a laziness issue;  even with strictness, one can't escape the fact that foldr calls itself in a non-tail position so that the stack will grow to the size of the list
18:48:25 <jason___> are there games that teach programming?
18:48:27 <IPHAIL__> i am clearly not a compsci student
18:48:32 <Astro> @type f (a -> b) -> f (b -> c) -> a -> f c
18:48:45 <jason___> I don't like reading that much. videos are ok... but games are fun
18:48:46 <Astro> @pl f (a -> b) -> f (b -> c) -> a -> f c
18:49:01 <jason___> if you can interact with the game to learn programming, I think that would be awesome
18:49:04 <aristid> jason___: programming also entails a LOT of reading.
18:49:05 <mm_freak> Astro: lambdabot is currently out of order
18:49:09 <dafis> g_cross: if the output can be generated (in part) from the first argument alone, foldr is good
18:49:11 <jeffhill> g_cross: Yeah, I only use foldr because the tutorials I've been reading suggest that foldl will blow up on you... but foldl seems pretty much exactly like the reduce function I'm used to.
18:49:13 <Eduard_Munteanu> jason___: um, if you're not seeing the fun in the job itself, perhaps you should reconsider.
18:49:19 <CakeProphet> jason___:  there are many programming education courses that utilize video game making. I don't think there's many helpful libraries for game-making in Haskell, but jmcarthur probably knows more about this than I.
18:49:34 <jason___> hmm. I can read just fine and I like making the programs
18:49:36 <jeffhill> foldl1' doesn't explode the stack, by the way.
18:49:41 <dafis> jeffhill: usually, you want either foldr or foldl' 
18:49:45 <jason___> I just don't want to sit down with a book to do it.
18:49:49 <ice_slice> Haskell is functional?
18:49:53 <mm_freak> jeffhill: foldl' is the same as 'reduce', if you're talking about python's 'reduce'
18:49:56 <jason___> I'm more of a learn by doing type of guy
18:50:00 <IPHAIL__> hi
18:50:01 <CakeProphet> ice_slice:  correct.
18:50:01 <aristid> ice_slice: yes
18:50:04 <Eduard_Munteanu> ice_slice: yes, in a very well defined sense.
18:50:05 <g_cross> dafis:  True, but that only works if the function fed to foldr short-circuits and doesn't need to see the rest of the list.
18:50:08 <krakklez> IPHAIL__: you fail
18:50:11 <aristid> jason___: programming IS learn by doing, in the most strict sense
18:50:12 <IPHAIL__> yes i do
18:50:13 <Eduard_Munteanu> Not as in "it works" :)
18:50:13 <dafis> foldr, if the function is lazy in the second argument, foldl' if it's strict
18:50:14 <IPHAIL__> thanks
18:50:14 <krakklez> :P
18:50:15 <g_cross> dafis: On the other hand, in that particular case it works well.
18:50:19 <aristid> jason___: but you will also have to read.
18:50:26 <jason___> right
18:50:31 <IPHAIL__> UBUNTU!
18:50:33 --- mode: ChanServ set +o jmcarthur
18:50:33 <IPHAIL__> it sounds funny
18:50:35 <krakklez> KUBUNTU
18:50:51 <jason___> well, one reason I'm liking the website is it is more interactive
18:50:59 <jason___> kind of like a game... not just reading a book
18:51:00 <Llyr> What's the pastebin website again?
18:51:00 --- mode: jmcarthur set +q *!*@gateway/web/freenode/ip.76.11.34.162
18:51:10 <mm_freak> finally
18:51:11 <jason___> I think I want to make my own website like that
18:51:15 <mm_freak> thank you, jmcarthur 
18:51:17 --- mode: ChanServ set -o jmcarthur
18:51:25 <mm_freak> trolls really make this channel unpleasant
18:51:30 <jmcarthur> yes they do
18:51:58 <jeffhill> Based on what I've done so far, it looks like foldl is always a poor choice, but foldl' is ok.  Why does foldl exist when foldl' does pretty much the same thing but in a non-exploding way?  Is there something I'm missing?
18:52:04 <jmcarthur> UPHAIL: sorry, it's on your ip, not just your nick
18:52:04 <jason___> perhaps the website that sent me here shouldn't send people to the chat program so early though
18:52:23 <Eduard_Munteanu> jeffhill: because you don't really want strictness all the time.
18:52:25 <jason___> we "n00bs" probably ask a lot of the same dumb questions
18:52:32 <mm_freak> jeffhill: foldl lazy
18:52:38 <jmcarthur> jason___: it's mostly been pretty tame today
18:52:46 <CakeProphet> jason___:  any question about Haskell is not a dumb question here.
18:52:49 <aristid> jason___: _you_ don't seem to be a troll
18:52:50 <jmcarthur> jason___: that's only the third that i'm aware of that we've had to kick or quiet all day
18:53:03 <dafis> Eduard_Munteanu: however, I've yet to see a real example where foldl is better than foldl'
18:53:30 <aristid> @src reverse
18:53:33 <Eduard_Munteanu> Third? It's the first I see and I'm spending some time in here.
18:53:36 <aristid> DAMN
18:53:44 <CakeProphet> .....I've realized that I'm addicted to lambdabot. :(
18:53:45 <aristid> lambdabot!
18:53:46 <CakeProphet> must get my fix.
18:53:46 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: at least the second today
18:53:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> dafis: yeah, I kinda agree it only leads to confusion to have non-strict by default.
18:53:52 <jason___> plus I don't get most of what you guys are talking about yet ^_^
18:53:55 --- mode: ChanServ set +o jmcarthur
18:53:57 <absentia-tryh> hi
18:54:04 <mm_freak> anyway, please let's not talk about trolls =)
18:54:05 <Llyr> The following doesn't work and I don't know why:
18:54:06 <Llyr> http://pastebin.org/411481
18:54:09 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: most of the time it's the other way around, strict code hangs up and lazy one gets through
18:54:10 --- mode: jmcarthur set +b *!*@gateway/web/freenode/ip.76.11.34.162
18:54:11 <aristid> CakeProphet: ghci helps, but it's not the whole thing
18:54:16 --- mode: ChanServ set -o jmcarthur
18:54:21 <CakeProphet> aristid:  aye. 
18:54:23 <Llyr> (Warning: Noob partial application is contained in that pastebin!)
18:54:24 <mm_freak> Llyr: replace '$' by '.'
18:54:34 <Llyr> Ah.
18:54:41 <jason___> what is the # for in front of the Haskell for?
18:54:50 <CakeProphet> IRC channel thing.
18:54:54 <jason___> ok
18:54:58 <mm_freak> f $ x = f x, so: (take 10 $ iterate f) x = take 10 (iterate f) x
18:55:00 <Llyr> mm_freak: Would you  mind saying a few words about why?
18:55:13 <CakeProphet> jason___:  all IRC channels, on freenode at least, start with a #
18:55:21 <jfdsgf> niggert
18:55:22 <aristid> or two ##
18:55:31 <jason___> what is freenode?
18:55:34 <jeffhill> Tomsik__: I understand, lazy code is great stuff... but it just seems foldl is a trap, because even if it's lazy, then it'll blow up on non-trivial input when forced.  But I am but an egg. ;)
18:55:35 <mm_freak> Llyr: ($) is function application, (.) is function composition
18:55:36 --- kick: jfdsgf was kicked by shapr (Kicked by shapr)
18:55:38 <jason___> nvm
18:55:39 <jason___> I will google it
18:55:41 <aristid> jason___: the network that this channel is on
18:55:43 <cncl> wow what's going on in here
18:55:45 --- mode: ChanServ set +o jmcarthur
18:55:47 <aristid> http://freenode.net
18:55:48 <mm_freak> Llyr: you have two functions, "take 10" and "iterate f"
18:55:52 <jmcarthur> i'm gonna stay like this for a while
18:55:52 <Llyr> mm_freak: Ah hah. That makes perfect sense.
18:56:00 <shapr> hiya cncl! Are you learning Haskell?
18:56:02 <aristid> jason___: tryhaskell.org embeds a chat window into freenode
18:56:02 <Llyr> mm_freak: Yes, I want to compose them, not just apply them.
18:56:08 <Llyr> mm_freak: TY good sir.
18:56:10 <Eduard_Munteanu> jmcarthur: it's probably not the same guy.
18:56:13 <mm_freak> Llyr: so you want to compose them instead of applying one to the other =)
18:56:21 <jason___> AWW I understand now aristid
18:56:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> jmcarthur: there's that Reddit-ed tryhaskell stuff. 
18:56:27 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: most of the time you work with small inputs, so
18:56:27 <etpace> $ should have a higher precedence than >>, having stuff like a $ b >> c become a (b >> c) isnt usually what I intended..
18:56:28 <jmcarthur> Eduard_Munteanu: it can't be unless he found a new ip
18:56:31 <g_cross> jmcarthur:  Slightly off-topic, but out of curiosity how do you get the power to make yourself an operator without already being an operator?
18:56:34 <mm_freak> if the first function would take a function as an argument and produce another function, then ($) would make sense
18:56:40 <mikem_> hi reddit
18:56:40 <Tomsik__> I mean, list of length 400 000 is an oddity
18:56:49 <mm_freak> Llyr:
18:56:52 <shapr> hiya mikem_, wanna learn Haskell?
18:56:53 <mm_freak> :t iterate $ drop 2
18:56:53 <mm_freak> iterate $ drop 2 :: [a] -> [[a]]
18:56:55 <Eduard_Munteanu> g_cross: Chanserv
18:57:00 <jason___> @jason___
18:57:09 <aristid> etpace: you could use do?
18:57:21 <jason___> sorry... just curious if I could get the @ sign too
18:57:27 <aristid> no
18:57:41 <WEALLPHAIL> lol
18:57:48 <jmcarthur> g_cross: somebody else added me as an op for the channel, so now chanserv will op me if i ask it to
18:57:55 <mikem_> @shapr YEP
18:57:58 <g_cross> jason__: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot#Interacting_with_the_Bot
18:58:04 <cncl> shapr: no, i'm reading OutsideIn(X) and seeing how exhaustiveness checking would work with GADTs
18:58:04 <theorbtwo> The @ represents channel operators, who have the power to kick or ban people (amongst other things).
18:58:06 <shapr> mikem_: That's awesome! Do you have any specific questions?
18:58:07 <g_cross> jmcarthur: Ah!  Okay, I see, thanks.
18:58:08 <theorbtwo> So no, you can't have one.
18:58:14 <etpace> I usually do aristid but for two functions I think a >> is "better"
18:58:19 <cncl> and then i glanced here and saw tons of people getting kicked/banned, haha
18:58:25 <knln> why to haskell
18:58:27 * shapr throws wobbly types at cncl 
18:58:35 <v> Hello Reddit
18:58:36 <aristid> etpace: yeah, just a suggestion :)
18:58:40 * cncl defends with boxy types
18:58:45 <jeffhill> Tomsik__: I've sort of gotten into the habit of expressing iteration as potentially very, very large lists, from playing about with Clojure... so it seems natural to me that you'd often work with potentially unbounded lists.  My project Euler code so far has Fibonacci and Primes as infinite lazy lists.
18:58:59 <Eduard_Munteanu> v: this isn't Reddit. It's the #haskell channel on Freenode.
18:59:10 <jeffhill> Tomsik__: Is that not done in Haskell?
18:59:18 <mm_freak> jeffhill: yes, that's fine
18:59:26 * shapr invokes Washburn and Weirich to make cncl's types even more exciting!
18:59:30 <dafis> jeffhill: it is done in Haskell
18:59:30 <Eduard_Munteanu> jeffhill: of course it's done.
18:59:37 <mm_freak> though i use lists mostly for number crunching and other data structures otherwise
18:59:46 <jason___> Hello V
18:59:48 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: folding over an infinite list doesn't usually make sense though
18:59:51 <jason___> I came from reddit too.
18:59:58 <shapr> cncl: I've met Washburn on two continents, but only met Weirich once.
19:00:21 <mikem_> not really, always wanted to learn programming never had the stones
19:00:26 <aristid> Tomsik__: why? you might be creating another infinite non-list datastructure, or a list datastructure with differen structure
19:00:31 <cncl> this is like pokemon but with type systems
19:00:33 <shapr> mikem_: We have stone soup, it comes with stones.
19:00:39 <aristid> cncl: lol
19:00:39 <jason___> haha
19:00:42 <shapr> cncl: haha, evil!
19:00:54 <jmcarthur> the influx of tourists from reddit today has certainly been interesting
19:01:01 <shapr> @remember cncl this is like pokemon but with type systems
19:01:02 <cncl> gotta catch 'em forall
19:01:06 <mikem_> i like you, you're funny
19:01:07 <shapr> cncl: hah!
19:01:09 <Tomsik__> aristid: I was thinking about simple "maximum" kind of, hum
19:01:12 <jason___> got to catch 'em all... program dorks!
19:01:12 <dafis> shapr: no bot
19:01:13 <jeffhill> Tomsik__: Agreed, because fold collapses.  Folding over very, very large but finite lists though... that's isomorphic to iteration in many cases.
19:01:16 <shapr> dafis: Oh no!
19:01:18 <Eduard_Munteanu> shapr: tough luck, lambdabot is dead :)
19:01:20 <mm_freak> Tomsik__: that's not true…  note that most infinite list functions can be and are expressed as right folds =)
19:01:24 <jason___> :)
19:01:24 <shapr> I miss lambdabot :-(
19:01:31 <shapr> Maybe I should start hosting lambdabot again.
19:01:32 <jmcarthur> LB has been missing most of the day :\
19:01:37 <Tomsik__> dang, turns out I am wrong again :p
19:01:43 <sanz> Guys! I am learning haskell!
19:01:44 <shapr> I used to host lambdabot in Finland and Sweden.
19:01:48 <aristid> Tomsik__: hmm maybe maximum... well, not maximum, but let's say sum... if you have a lazy Num instance, that might work
19:01:50 <shapr> sanz: Awesome! How do you like it so far?
19:01:56 <jmcarthur> i feel exposed
19:01:58 <jason___> what's a lambdabo?
19:01:58 --- mode: ChanServ set -o jmcarthur
19:02:03 <jason___> bot
19:02:06 <sanz> It's awesome.
19:02:13 <sanz> I am on step 3 of lesson 1.
19:02:16 <Eduard_Munteanu> jason___: it's a bot we have here that we ask to evaluate Haskell expressions.
19:02:18 <shapr> jason___: It's an IRC bot written in Haskell. It has nifty tools and toys.
19:02:32 <aristid> it can transform expressions into point-free style, AND BACK
19:02:35 <aristid> !!!!
19:02:36 <jmcarthur> jason___: lambdabot is a bot that's normally in here. "she" does a lot of nifty stuff, especially for helping to us teach noobs :)
19:02:36 <jeffhill> artistid: How could you use fold on an infinite list?  When you actually go to get the evaluated result, it'll just blow up?
19:02:40 <jason___> So you use it to debug your programs
19:02:50 <jason___> and teach people like me
19:02:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> jason___: rather it's more useful when talking
19:02:56 <aristid> jeffhill: that's why you only partially evaluate it
19:02:58 <theorbtwo> jason___: It's the channel bot.  You ask it questions, and it answers them.  Think of it as a talking reference.
19:02:59 <etpace> you can fold a lazy function jeffhill 
19:03:13 <dafis> jeffhill: foldr (++) [] (repeat [a])
19:03:15 <jason___> so I can stop asking stupid questions here
19:03:15 <jmcarthur> zygoloid: no more zygotron?
19:03:18 <shapr> g'nite everybody! I'll be back to code again later!
19:03:19 <jason___> or just googling
19:03:31 <jeffhill> dafis: Mind = blown.  Thank you. ;)
19:03:32 <jason___> bye shapr
19:03:38 <jmcarthur> jason___: we encourage questions as long as they are on topic and not obvious trolls
19:03:41 <Tomsik__> jeffhill: consider (\n g -> case g of Nothing -> Nothing | Just b -> Just (n+b))
19:03:44 <Tomsik__> Doesn't it make sense :p
19:03:57 <Tomsik__> I have no idea if it would work, but still
19:04:00 <Tomsik__> err
19:04:04 <theorbtwo> Some folds will work on an infinite list, some won't.
19:04:07 <Tomsik__> something like that anyway
19:04:16 <mm_freak> my favorite mind blower is my subsequences implementation =)
19:04:22 <dafis> Tomsik__: it needs to inspect the second arg, so that won't
19:04:24 <mm_freak> subseqs = filterM (const [True, False])
19:04:25 <mm_freak> =)
19:04:30 <jmcarthur> jason___: sometimes even an obvious troll is welcome, e.g. when Cale has some time to kill (i hear he can talk a troll to death)
19:04:33 <cncl> jeffhill: look up 'guarded recursion'
19:04:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> LOL
19:05:27 <aristid> jeffhill: another infinite fold: foldr (fmap (1:) . (:)) [] [1..]
19:05:45 <jason___> Is that someone who comes here often? Cale?
19:05:48 <etpace> is that a subsequence mm_freak? I thought [2,3] was a subsequence of [1,2,3] but [1,3] wasn't
19:05:48 <jmcarthur> yes
19:05:56 <aristid> preflex: seen Cale
19:05:56 <preflex>  Cale was last seen on #haskell 14 hours, 47 minutes and 32 seconds ago, saying: listofoptions: The orignal Perl 6 interpreter was written in Haskell but I don't know if it's being maintained now. I believe the plan is for Perl 6 to have a self-hosting compiler.
19:06:09 <Eduard_Munteanu> Really now, Cale is helpful with lots of stuff and takes time to explain.
19:06:17 <jmcarthur> absolutely
19:06:24 <mm_freak> etpace: it's the subsequences function, which calculates the subsequences of a list
19:06:27 <jmcarthur> cale enhances the #haskell flavor
19:06:33 <aristid> and he made lambdabot's (.)
19:06:37 <aristid> be fmap
19:06:38 <jmcarthur> ugh
19:06:42 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah, one of the #math guys that groks programming.
19:06:44 <mm_freak> etpace: 
19:06:46 <etpace> I know it's the powerset mm_freak, but i was just chucking that subsequnces = powerset
19:06:46 <mm_freak> > filterM (const [True, False]) "abc"
19:06:46 <mm_freak> ["abc","ab","ac","a","bc","b","c",""]
19:06:50 * hackagebot blocking-transactions 0.1.0.4 - Composable, blocking transactions.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blocking-transactions-0.1.0.4 (ChristopherLaneHinson)
19:06:52 <jmcarthur> caleskell is one of the downsides of having a resident cale
19:06:53 <dafis> mm_freak: perhaps etpace means it's sublists
19:06:59 <etpace> yeah
19:07:05 <etpace> i was just wondering on the definition of a subsequence
19:07:07 <dafis> while subsequences should be contiguous
19:07:21 <dafis> etpace: not chiselled in stone
19:07:26 <mm_freak> hmm, same thing
19:07:29 <jason___> you guys use a lot of words I've never heard before
19:07:30 <mm_freak> i used to call it subsets
19:07:37 <jmcarthur> jason___: they grow on you :)
19:07:41 <mm_freak> but in Data.List it's called subsequences
19:07:43 <jason___> are these all programming terms?
19:07:52 <theorbtwo> jason___: If you hang around, you get to figure some of them out.
19:08:01 <Eduard_Munteanu> jason___: not commonly
19:08:01 <aristid> jason___: most programmers haven't heard these words either
19:08:05 <tehgeekmeister> what's the rules for indentation after "do"?  how do you indent less than the level of indentation the do itself is at?  i have some long function names and want to avoid indenting 20 or so chars for the 1st level.
19:08:06 <jason___> yeah, I learn concatination the other day... just ment sticking stuff together
19:08:07 <theorbtwo> jason___: Some of them are.  Some of them are math terms.  Some of them are just haskell words.
19:08:08 <jmcarthur> jason___: this channel tends to have lots of programming terms yes, but also a lot of math terms
19:08:23 <Eduard_Munteanu> tehgeekmeister: there's ';'
19:08:29 <jmcarthur> jason___: lots of smart people here. i've learned a TON during my time here
19:08:29 <jeffhill> cncl: Thank you for the link to guarded recursion.  That's awesome stuff.
19:08:30 <mm_freak> tehgeekmeister: if the 'do' keyword stands alone, the next line defines the indentation level
19:08:37 <cncl> jeffhill: yup
19:08:41 <mm_freak> so you can write:
19:08:43 <mm_freak> main = do
19:08:44 <mm_freak>   blah
19:08:58 <jason___> I'll come back after dinner. My mom is calling me
19:09:02 <tehgeekmeister> mm_freak: that's what i was looking for, thanks.
19:09:07 <jmcarthur> how old are you jason___ ?
19:09:09 <jason___> 12
19:09:16 <cncl> awesome
19:09:24 <jmcarthur> we've been getting a younger crowd here today thanks to reddit
19:09:37 <mm_freak> jason___: learning haskell at your age will be a virtue =)
19:09:45 <jmcarthur> i wish i had learned haskell when i was 12
19:09:48 <heatsink> contiguous_subsequences = concat . map (inits . drop 1) . tails
19:09:55 <mm_freak> i learned qbasic and turbo pascal, when i was 12
19:09:56 <monochrom> why does everyone claim their age is 12? it's statistically impossible
19:10:06 <jmcarthur> impossible!
19:10:06 <etpace> why drop 1 heatsink 
19:10:13 <aristid> jmcarthur: i was fantasizing about that today... what would have been if i had started with haskell instead of another language?
19:10:16 <mm_freak> monochrom: simple: the others were trolls
19:10:17 <jmcarthur> i learned qbasic when i was... 7 :)
19:10:18 <Tomsik__> When I was 12 I was out in the playground. :p
19:10:28 <heatsink> etpace: Avoids repeated empty sequences
19:10:41 <heatsink> oh, should be (drop 1 . inits)
19:10:43 <mm_freak> jmcarthur: i got my first computer (with win95) when i was 10 or 11 =)
19:10:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> Aye, been messing around in that crap when I was really young.
19:10:50 <etpace> sure
19:11:33 <jmcarthur> mm_freak: my first computer was from an era before my time, so this isn't as significant about my age as it may sound... but my first computer was a c64
19:11:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> Having a DOS-enabled (rather disabled) computer since 5 or 6 really makes something.
19:11:51 <heatsink> jmcarthur: So was mine
19:11:55 <mm_freak> jmcarthur: i never understood all that hype around c64
19:11:59 <jmcarthur> heatsink: high five!
19:12:05 <etpace> I had a computer when I was about 10, but I just played games on it
19:12:05 <jmcarthur> i loved it
19:12:07 <etpace> nothing productive :p
19:12:10 <mm_freak> when i tried to use one, i found it annoying
19:12:27 <CakeProphet> > "Why do you hate me lambdabot? Why did you leave?"
19:12:32 <CakeProphet> :(
19:12:35 <Eduard_Munteanu> Never had consoles though, that includes C64 and that stuff.
19:12:52 <aristid> @pl let x = x in x
19:13:08 <mm_freak> aristid: that's not a function
19:13:11 <mm_freak> it's bottom
19:13:13 <dafis> <lambdabot> <<loop>>
19:13:21 <aristid> mm_freak: but it has points
19:13:30 <mm_freak> aristid: yes, itself
19:13:42 <mm_freak> just like x = 3 has itself as a point =)
19:13:57 <mm_freak> aristid: but you can still unpoint it to 'undefined'
19:13:58 <aristid> mm_freak: the x is no point? hmm i guess i misunderstood what a point is
19:14:18 <mm_freak> no, the x is no point…  a point is a function argument
19:14:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> Um, what kind is 'undefined' really?
19:14:28 <heatsink> jmcarthur: I was pretty young at the time, though.  I recall Frogger being a scary game.
19:14:36 <theorbtwo> Eduard_Munteanu: undefined is of every type.
19:14:37 <jmcarthur> heh
19:14:37 <mm_freak> that comes from geometry:  sin(x) takes a point and gives a point
19:14:51 <mm_freak> theorbtwo: undefined is of a certain type:  a
19:14:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah.
19:15:01 <mm_freak> theorbtwo: but it can unify with every type
19:15:17 <Eduard_Munteanu> Does it even stand in the kind hierarchy somewhere?
19:15:17 <djahandarie> > "blah"
19:15:20 <haskellbot>  "blah"
19:15:25 <Tomsik__> <3
19:15:27 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yahoo.
19:15:27 <djahandarie> For the moment :)
19:15:31 <aristid> mm_freak: ok, thanks, that refines my understanding...
19:15:32 <djahandarie> It's not lambdabot
19:15:33 <jmcarthur> heatsink: i was quite young at the time as well. i don't even remember my age for sure. 5 maybe?
19:15:37 <cncl> Eduard_Munteanu: look up denotational semantics and bottom
19:15:37 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: it's of kind *
19:15:39 <djahandarie> Just the mueval
19:15:47 <jmcarthur> i mostly played games on it too
19:15:49 <Eduard_Munteanu> I see.
19:15:57 <mm_freak> (or is it?)
19:16:02 <theorbtwo> Eduard_Munteanu: I think the answer is *, but since all other kinds are a subset of *, that's not a very useful answer either.
19:16:03 <heatsink> jmcarthur: I'd be scared if you were programming at age 5.
19:16:23 <heatsink> Or even doing serious word processing.
19:16:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> But I guess it's also a * -> *, since you can write f = undefined
19:16:41 <cncl> they had LOGO at my school in second grade, i could make the turtle recursively draw a spiral and then crash
19:17:00 <jmcarthur> heatsink: heh. no, not until 7 ;)
19:17:02 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: if f is a function, it's of kind *
19:17:03 <aristid> cncl: the crashing was probably the most fun part
19:17:11 <heatsink> :)
19:17:11 <cncl> aristid: yes definitely
19:17:15 <mm_freak> or say:  its type is of kind *
19:17:19 <cncl> "haha it stopped! stupid computer!"
19:17:22 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah.
19:17:38 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: something of kind * -> * would be a type constructor
19:17:46 <mm_freak> like:  (Int ->)
19:17:47 <etpace> if I have stuff <- lines <$> hGetContents h, would stuff !! 712 or whatever only load the line 712 from disk into memory?
19:17:52 <mm_freak> or IO
19:18:04 <mm_freak> it doesn't make much sense to ask for the kind of a value
19:18:13 <mm_freak> because as soon as you observe a value, you are at kind *
19:18:16 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: mm, I thought every function's type was of kind * -> *, wasn't it?
19:18:23 <dafis> etpace: it needs all lines until the 712th
19:18:25 <mm_freak> no, a function is of kind *
19:18:29 <monochrom> would load lines 0 to 712 from disk
19:18:30 <aristid> etpace: it would probably read all the file up to that line, i don't think it's so clever
19:18:41 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: note that kinds are a feature of /types/, not /values/
19:18:47 <mm_freak> a function is a value
19:18:59 <theorbtwo> There's no general way to read the 712th line of a file without reading the lines up to it (on a normal OS).
19:19:00 <mm_freak> and every value has a type of kind *
19:19:07 <dafis> etpace: but the first lines *may* be garbage-collected immediately
19:19:09 <mm_freak> you can't construct a value of type, say, (-> Int)
19:19:12 <mm_freak> or of type IO
19:19:14 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: oh, right. So I suppose * -> * includes type operators?
19:19:14 <dafis> depends on your code
19:19:18 <etpace> I don't mind reading, but I don't want them to hang about
19:19:20 <Tomsik__> > foldr (\a b -> case (a, b) of (Just x, Just y) -> Just (x+y) ; _-> Nothing) (Just 0) ([(Just 1), (Just 2), (Just 3)]++repeat Nothing)

19:19:29 <Tomsik__> HA HA!
19:19:36 <Tomsik__> It does work.
19:19:44 <etpace> i have a huge sorted file, and I just want to say index or binary chop into it to find a "nearest" value to my key, without loading all the file into memory and blowing up
19:19:45 <mm_freak> theorbtwo: no, there is no such way
19:19:54 * hackagebot blocking-transactions 0.1.0.5 - Composable, blocking transactions.  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blocking-transactions-0.1.0.5 (ChristopherLaneHinson)
19:20:06 <monochrom> if line length is variable, you're doomed
19:20:11 <mm_freak> theorbtwo: unless the lines have a regular format (in other words:  you can calculate the position of that line)
19:20:16 <etpace> hmm.
19:20:29 <aristid> Tomsik__: foldr (liftA2 (+)) (Just 0) ([(Just 1), (Just 2), (Just 3)])
19:20:31 <etpace> I could probably make it static I think, then I can just seek by offsets right?
19:20:36 <dafis> etpace: it's easy to write the code so that too much of the file stays in memory
19:20:39 <monochrom> yes
19:20:40 <Eduard_Munteanu> mmap? :)
19:20:48 <Eduard_Munteanu> I'm not sure how that translates to Haskell.

19:24:07 <_|_> wow snap
19:24:08 <dafis> mm_freak: I'm happy with lazy ByteStrings :)
19:24:21 <_|_> though snape would probably make an interesting framework
19:24:40 <mm_freak> i'm not happy with them =/
19:25:09 <handonson> is there a way I can exit the program, regardless of what thread I am in?
19:25:15 <dafis> mm_freak: then UR doin' it rong, perhaps ;)
19:25:19 <CakeProphet> so I've just invented a language that actually is purely lazy
19:25:25 <mm_freak> handonson: System.Exit
19:25:26 <CakeProphet> what I mean by that, is that it never truly evaluates.
19:25:39 <handonson> mm_freak: regardless of what thread I am in
19:25:40 <CakeProphet> you do not even need an interpreter or compiler to run this language.
19:25:44 <mm_freak> handonson: but using proper concurrency constructs is the preferred way, of course
19:25:52 <Tomsik__> CakeProphet: it comes to the conclusion, that user doesn't need the software anyway? :p
19:25:53 <mm_freak> handonson: yes, i think so
19:25:56 <aristid> CakeProphet: sounds like a great simplification
19:26:02 <handonson> mm_freak: no, i've tried it
19:26:07 <mm_freak> handonson: otherwise you need to throwTo the main thread
19:26:12 <Eduard_Munteanu> cat source_code.foo | /bin/true ?
19:26:19 <aristid> Tomsik__: back to the good old days of subsistence agriculture.
19:26:22 <mm_freak> handonson: use myThreadId and throwTo
19:26:27 <handonson> that means I have to pass the main threadID to that thread
19:26:33 <handonson> I don't want to do that
19:26:37 <CakeProphet> handonson:  what I do is have the main thread wait for a shutdown message.
19:26:51 <mm_freak> handonson: use concurrency constructs
19:27:01 <handonson> CakeProphet: that too requires passing the main thead id at the beginning
19:27:10 <Tomsik__> what you can do
19:27:15 <Tomsik__> it to create a segfault
19:27:17 <Tomsik__> :p
19:27:18 <mm_freak> handonson: no, that requires passing an MVar or something like that
19:27:32 <handonson> oh yeah
19:27:36 <CakeProphet> handonson:  or a Chan. but yeah
19:27:38 <handonson> Chan
19:27:38 <CakeProphet> still passing something.
19:27:51 <handonson> yeah the point is you have to pass something
19:27:51 <CakeProphet> in my current project I'm using TChan
19:27:52 <mm_freak> and unless you want to use global variables (i bet you don't), yes, passing is the way to go
19:28:00 <mm_freak> but you can use a monad transformer to ease that
19:28:26 <handonson> I just want a function that wherever you use it the program cleanly exits
19:28:42 <dafis> handonson: if you don't pass anything, system "/sbin/halt" is the only way
19:28:50 <mm_freak> you don't want that function in haskell…  after all you've chosen haskell to write clean code
19:28:58 <CakeProphet> handonson:  it's not so bad as you think. You could wrap it in a data structure with other thread-state information, if the need arises. Or if you only need to pass the one Chan, then no big deal.
19:29:06 <Eduard_Munteanu> Or sending SIGKILL to yourself or the main thread?
19:29:11 <mm_freak> and really, using concurrency is very easy
19:29:36 <handonson> CakeProphet: I'm already using TVars for inter-thread communication
19:30:05 <Tomsik__> Well, escaping sounds like continuations
19:30:19 <mm_freak> Tomsik__: exiting a concurrent program doesn't, though
19:30:30 <mm_freak> handonson: type MyApplicationT = StateT Configuration
19:30:48 <ask> hello
19:31:09 <mm_freak> this is one of the easiest ways to deal with that, and it's very clean
19:31:13 <CakeProphet> handonson:  yes, State monad can help with managing passed around values.
19:31:13 <handonson> mm_freak: IO monad is supposed to do unclean things and I have a thread that is IO () and I want it to "kill the program" which is an unclean thing to do with IO monads
19:31:40 <mm_freak> handonson: you can do it cleanly probably with less effort
19:31:43 <Tomsik__> Eh, it's easy, to have IO do the dirty work for you
19:31:51 <Tomsik__> you wanna have your hands clean, eh
19:31:51 <ask> what's the coolest thing you've programmed in haskell
19:31:52 <mm_freak> and no, the IO monad is not there to do "unclean" stuff
19:31:55 <mm_freak> just "impure" stuff
19:32:03 <handonson> whatever you call it
19:32:13 <jason___> Ok. I'm back from dinner. What do you mean by "unclean" coding?
19:32:25 <handonson> System.Exit.exitSuccess
19:32:37 <Eduard_Munteanu> ask: Oleg does some crazy stuff :)
19:33:00 <jason___> Iss that like extra code or buggy code?
19:33:18 <handonson> would you please read the conversation if you're interested
19:33:21 <handonson> ...
19:33:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> If that's what you're looking for. http://okmij.org/ftp/
19:33:41 <djahandarie> ask, really depends on what you think is cool if you want to find something cool
19:34:01 <handonson> my apologies if you were asking mm
19:34:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> BTW, is Oleg ever in here?
19:34:32 <djahandarie> I think he has been in here before
19:34:45 <udha> hay guise im trying haskellol
19:34:45 <dafis> preflex: seen oleg
19:34:46 <preflex>  oleg was last seen on #perl 1 year, 180 days, 7 hours, 32 minutes and 32 seconds ago, saying: oh hey... perlre... I wish I knew about that before I tried to make a project work
19:34:47 <dolio> Really? I missed that.
19:34:52 <handonson> so you can already System.Exit.exitSuccess it in your main function. why can't I use it in some other IO thread
19:35:18 <monochrom> I don't know why, but I wouldn't ruin a day over it.
19:35:19 <djahandarie> dolio, I wasn't there for it either, though I remember someone mentioning that
19:36:00 <djahandarie> handonson, you can use it in another thread. It just exits that thread.
19:36:00 <NickBoB> Haskell is pretty aweseom.
19:36:04 <CakeProphet> jason___:  unclean code is hard to reason about and hard to maintain.
19:36:04 <NickBoB> awesome*
19:36:20 <CakeProphet> jason___:  at least, that's my definition. It varies by person. It's a vague notion.
19:36:28 <jason___> thanks CakeProphet
19:36:33 <handonson> djahandarie: yeah which is funny because it's called System.Exit.exitSuccess
19:37:02 <mm_freak> handonson: i've coded an example for you
19:37:16 <jason___> It doesn't sound like a programmer to have vague definitions. :)

19:37:51 <NickBoB> awesome*
19:38:02 <mm_freak> handonson: at some point, you will want something like that anyway
19:38:06 <Jafet> Unclean code is the one for which you fudge the commit logs ten minutes before it gets reviewed.
19:38:08 <mm_freak> so better code it now rather than later =)
19:38:12 <CakeProphet> jason___:  in actual technical speak, it's rare to have vague terms, yes. But when describing subjective notions such as code readability, maintainability, etc. it helps to have some colorful adjectives.
19:38:19 <CakeProphet> jason___:  there's also business jargon, which is the worst.
19:38:31 <CakeProphet> jason___:  "agile development", etc.
19:38:36 <monochrom> nay, colourful expletives
19:38:42 <jason___> haha. thanks CakeProphet
19:39:00 <CakeProphet> no problem. :)
19:39:12 <cads> it seems like my function has to be f : [[Float]] -> [[Float]], and to know how to automatically handle vectors of different dimension
19:39:33 <dafis> cads: arrays?
19:39:48 <aristid> cads: that type looks like f = transpose :D
19:39:52 <jason___> So I think being a programmer would be a fun job
19:39:57 <cads> can I define a function that takes arrays of different rank?
19:40:07 <handonson> mm_freak: no, i won't want it forever, because my code is almost done and will finish by giving a thread the capability to kill the program
19:40:07 <jason___> How much do you get paid to program Haskell?
19:40:08 <cads> aristid: it is that type, now that you mention it :)
19:40:08 <CakeProphet> jason___:  dunno. I've never worked as a programmer. Programming as a hobby certainly is fun.
19:40:26 <dafis> cads: array functions should work on arbitrary ranks
19:40:59 <mm_freak> handonson: well, who's doing the cleanup?
19:41:11 <jason___> I think so. I want to make something simple first. Maybe a game that does tic-tac-toe or something like that
19:41:12 <CakeProphet> jason___: it's hard to find a job with a business using Haskell. I bet most people who program Haskell here use it for hobby projects.
19:41:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> CakeProphet: or paid for research like SPJ :D
19:42:06 <CakeProphet> jason___:  games are generally too complicated to program alone without the help of an instructor or something. You should start with simple command line things. Something that asks the user type in input. 
19:42:24 <aristid> tic tac toe is doable though.
19:42:28 <handonson> mm_freak: the code is a very simple script to do some socket communication and after it passes a simple test i think i'll compile it and upload it to the server and not pay attention to it forever
19:42:34 <CakeProphet> aristid:  yes.
19:42:44 <CakeProphet> I suppose a text-based tic-tac-toe would be the easiest place to start, maybe?
19:42:46 <jason___> I did the user input stuff with Simple Basic
19:42:58 <Eduard_Munteanu> Game programming is probably one of the worst goals one can pick wrt expectancies.
19:43:12 <etpace> hmm, i'm using the statistics package and I have a number of data points, and i've been able to find the kernel density etc -- what i'm wondering is, is it possible to generate a probability density function from a number of samples?
19:43:19 <CakeProphet> jason___:  well, Haskell is a bit different from SB. Might want to refresh. But yes, I think a text-based tic-tac-toe would be a good project.
19:43:23 <mm_freak> handonson: well, it's your business of course, but i couldn't be happy with it (especially seeing that coding that up took me less time than to look for an exiting function)
19:43:39 <dafis> etpace: no, but you can estimate
19:43:51 <etpace> estimate the function?
19:44:09 <jason___> I'm surprised there are only 5 or so people talking in here with so many people watching this channel
19:44:11 <dafis> etpace: estimate the probability distribution
19:44:18 <aristid> CakeProphet: "a bit different from basic" LOL
19:44:27 <mm_freak> jason___: this is an IRC phenomenon…  it's called idling =)
19:44:29 <CakeProphet> jason___:  that's IRC for you.
19:44:32 <djahandarie> A probability density function needs to be continuous
19:44:32 <Eduard_Munteanu> Silence is a virtue. :)
19:44:40 * monochrom is watching you!
19:44:51 <aristid> jason___: it's much better this way. imagine if 40 people were trying to talk at the same time.
19:44:51 <handonson> mm_freak: i guess it took you a short time because you're a completely new one. on the other hand, i need to change the whole structure of an existing code.
19:44:56 <etpace> Hmm, perhaps im asking the wrong question
19:45:29 <mm_freak> handonson: why?  are you threads in the IO monad?  my threads are almost always in some custom monad
19:45:40 <jason___> I want to learn how to program because my uncle does it. He works for a big bank and does investment programming. He is REALLY good at math and programming.
19:45:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: how do you type UTF-8 consistently?

19:46:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> Been writing APL or Agda code for years? :P
19:46:16 <mm_freak> jason___: haskell is used in finance a bit
19:46:21 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: xmodmap
19:46:32 <jason___> So Haskell seems pretty flexible. I like how you can pretty much get it to do anything you want.
19:46:37 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, typing an ellipsis is easy… 
19:46:38 <etpace> Given a number of samples over [a,b], I can graph a p robability distribution -- now is there a way to create a function that when called, returns a number in the interval [a,b] according to the estimated probability curve
19:46:51 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: oh, that's what you mean…  well, it's just habit =)
19:47:00 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm, my compose key doesn't generate useful stuff.
19:47:01 <mm_freak> and no, i have never written an agda program
19:47:04 <etpace> i'm probably getting mixed up with my terminology, forgive me  need to read up a bit
19:47:17 <mm_freak> and haven't even thought of writing an APL program =)
19:47:42 <monochrom> etpace: that is hard, it involves inverting the probability curve
19:47:55 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm, I'll be looking for useful mappings then. I hope there's some standard stuff.
19:48:02 <etpace> aha
19:48:07 <handonson> mm_freak: i've just decided to completely change the role of threads but, to answer your question, the main function is a loop. it has a blocking function (which may take very long because it waits for a socket recv) inside
19:48:18 <etpace> are there workarounds that make it more of an estimate?
19:48:25 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, on X, the compose sequences are part of your keymap.
19:48:52 <Saizan> handonson: you would throwTo it
19:48:55 <mm_freak> handonson: mostly my main function is very simple…  it starts threads and waits for commands from them
19:48:56 <Saizan> *could
19:49:01 <monochrom> yes there are always ways to just estimate. I am not familiar with them.
19:49:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> Draconx|Laptop: well yeah, on the normal, US keymap, I use, I get stuff like áóñ÷åòôù
19:49:21 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, ellipsis is probably compose + . + .
19:49:28 <Eduard_Munteanu> ®®
19:49:45 <mm_freak> Saizan: he doesn't want to, because he doesn't want to pass anything to the thread
19:49:52 <mm_freak> throwTo would need the ThreadId
19:50:12 <mm_freak> k s
19:50:13 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm, perhaps Alt isn't Compose.
19:50:28 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: i can send you my xmodmap file, if you wish
19:50:38 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, the us keymap doesn't have compose by default.
19:50:48 <handonson> Saizan: thank you very much, but i've already gotten that answer. besides, just as i said, i solved the problem. i decided to change the role of threads
19:51:15 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: ah, I was hoping there was something standard.
19:51:24 <mm_freak> Eduard_Munteanu: http://streitmacht.eu/Xmodmap
19:51:27 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, you can set it to, say, the menu key by: setxkbmap -option 'compose:menu'
19:51:29 <Eduard_Munteanu> mm_freak: thanks.
19:51:33 <mm_freak> nope, you'll probably need to write it yourself
19:51:58 <geheimdienst> eduard_munteanu, use "setxkbmap -option compose:menu" to set compose to the context menu key
19:52:08 <mm_freak> of, if you use KDE, you can map key combinations in its configuration
19:52:14 <geheimdienst> (next to the right control key, i mean)
19:52:19 <Eduard_Munteanu> Draconx|Laptop: well I think Alt is indeed compose, otherwise how can I write 'el niño' or 2÷3.
19:52:34 <mm_freak> side note:  i use Alt Gr to type unicode stuff
19:52:44 <mm_freak> like alt gr + shift + r = ℝ
19:52:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm, menu would be good, I use Win key for xmonad.
19:52:54 <Draconx|Laptop> Eduard_Munteanu, no idea, but it means you're not using the default us 104-key keymap that comes with X.
19:52:59 <mm_freak> (otherwise i wouldn't use alt gr for anything)
19:53:05 <mm_freak> ((other than @ and stuff))
19:53:25 <monochrom> import System.Posix.Signals; ... raiseSignal softwareTermination
19:53:33 <ManateeLazyCat> :preflex seen dons
19:53:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah, there might be some xmodmap hack in there for xmonad mod key (which is Super_L) and that stuff.
19:53:43 <ManateeLazyCat> @preflex seen dons
19:53:57 <ManateeLazyCat> preflex seen dons
19:53:57 <preflex>  dons was last seen on #haskell 2 hours, 25 minutes and 27 seconds ago, saying: ivanm: well, i don't have a lot of time to comment 
19:55:12 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Looks hs-plugins exist bug, i test some demo, always "resolvedObjs failed"
19:55:44 <monochrom> in GHC 6.10?
19:55:52 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: 6.12.3
19:56:09 * monochrom blinks eyes, you got it to work?
19:56:13 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: I have send two patches to fix hs-plugins with Cabal-1.8, but still something wrong.
19:56:20 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: yes.
19:56:33 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: Can compile now, but some demo can't pass. 
19:57:23 * ManateeLazyCat pasted "hs-plugins patch." at http://paste2.org/get/923147
19:57:23 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: Patch at ^^^^ 
19:57:55 <monochrom> If I read the source correctly, it parses *.hi by its own code, rather than asking ghc-api to parse it, so it can become forward-incompatible
19:58:15 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: Yes.
19:58:35 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: hs-plugins have some code to read *.hi file instead use ghc-api
19:58:47 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: It can work on ghc-6.10.x ?
19:59:17 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: If so, looks ghc-6.12.x break hs-plugins.
20:00:23 <mm_freak> there should be some 3D window manager written in haskell
20:00:29 <monochrom> Yes I installed it on ghc-6.10.x.
20:00:45 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: All testsuite can pass?
20:00:47 <mm_freak> i'd like to have a WM, which i can extend in haskell, but i don't like xmonad
20:00:53 <monochrom> I don't know.
20:01:13 <ManateeLazyCat> monochrom: I have test those demos on ghc-6.12.x, most demo are failed
20:01:37 <jason___> So what kind of programs do you guys make?
20:03:11 * ManateeLazyCat Hmm, hs-plugins can't work even compile pass.......
20:03:11 <fy__> I write programs that write programs.
20:03:31 <etpace> monochrom: yeah, thinking about this -- i've got no idea where to begin 
20:03:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> Nice, it seems Compose is something different than Alt.
20:03:44 <etpace> How I can go from a pdf curve to a function that generates random numbers following said curve is a bit.. eh
20:04:11 <Eduard_Munteanu> Alt + a makes á while Compose + a + ' makes á
20:04:20 <Eduard_Munteanu> Now it's set to Menu.
20:05:36 <mm_freak> jason___: mostly little helpers
20:07:11 <Eduard_Munteanu> What's wrong with xmonad?
20:07:26 <Phyx-> fy__: that run?
20:07:28 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah, perhaps tiling is wrong if you don't like it.
20:07:55 <ddarius> My old xmonad worked better than my new xmonad.  This is why I never upgrade
20:08:18 <jason___> I got disconnected somehow
20:08:39 <geheimdienst> @instances TimeLocale
20:09:15 <jason___> @instances
20:09:23 <jason___> TimeLocale
20:09:26 <pastorn> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/haskell98/latest/doc/html/Locale.html
20:09:40 <jason___> @instances TimeLocale
20:09:48 <pastorn> lambdabot is dead
20:09:49 <Eduard_Munteanu> My main problem with xmonad went away when I switched from dzen to xmobar.
20:10:05 <geheimdienst> thanks pastorn, i'm already looking at that ...
20:10:19 <pastorn> is there some way to find out which country the machine running some program runs in?
20:10:31 <monochrom> no
20:10:32 <geheimdienst> guys, how do i get the current locale, as specified in the LANG environment variable?
20:10:34 <Eduard_Munteanu> The "I can't update the bar periodically" crap went away.
20:10:49 <geheimdienst> i mean for formatting a date/time
20:11:00 <geheimdienst> defaultTimeLocale doesn't seem to cut it
20:13:37 <ManateeLazyCat> @tell dons I plan to build another plugins package base on your pdynload, and use ghc-api parse *.hi file for forward-compatible. 
20:14:06 <lispy> ?src (*>)
20:14:20 <lispy> What is the intuition behind (*>)?
20:14:47 <lispy> is it (>>) for applicativeS?
20:14:58 <ddarius> :t liftA2 (flip const)
20:15:05 <ddarius> :t (*>)
20:15:05 <geheimdienst> the asterisk looks a little like an eye, and the > could be a big nose
20:15:25 <geheimdienst> so it's a side view of a big-nosed dude with no mouth
20:15:34 <Shengkai> Cool...
20:15:39 <geheimdienst> that would be my intuition. hth.
20:15:50 <monochrom> "Sequence actions, discarding the value of the first argument."
20:15:55 <lispy> geheimdienst: heh, I doubt that's how the compiler sees it :)
20:16:23 <heatsink> (*) :: f a -> f b -> f ()
20:16:38 <lispy> What happened to lambdabot this time?
20:16:44 <heatsink> (*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f ()
20:17:13 <monochrom> () :: Applicative f => f ()
20:17:48 <ddarius> Apparently, <> would be ($)
20:20:13 <jm3> greetings.
20:20:20 <jm3> trying haskell
20:20:24 <Haskell_Rascal> Hello World! :D
20:20:28 <jm3> good evening, frigtards.
20:20:37 <Haskell_Rascal> Trying Haskell now
20:20:49 <Haskell_Rascal> module Main where   main :: IO () main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
20:21:00 <Haskell_Rascal> how come that didn't work?!?!
20:21:13 <ddarius> You need semicolons or newlines.
20:21:38 <Haskell_Rascal> thanks
20:21:54 <pastorn> Haskell_Rascal: main :: IO (); main = putStrLn "hi!";
20:21:59 <pastorn> for a one-liner
20:22:09 <ddarius> 'don't need the last semicolon
20:22:10 <absentia> nI wish try haskell supported cut and paste.
20:22:26 <mm_freak> a two-liner is probably better…  i tend to avoid semicolons
20:22:44 <ddarius> Or you could just remove "main :: IO ()"
20:22:45 <pastorn> ddarius: doesn't hurt :)
20:23:03 <ddarius> :t \m -> do m;;;;;;;m
20:23:10 <ddarius> Curses
20:23:15 <Haskell_Rascal> cool
20:23:15 <pastorn> ddarius: haha
20:23:52 <Haskell_Rascal> *shakes fists at sky* I will master the Haskell!
20:24:12 <geheimdienst> ;-)
20:24:20 <Phoebe> there's a mispelling in the tutorial
20:24:21 <Phoebe> let villain = (28,"chirs") in fst villain
20:25:03 <ddarius> Must villians have traditional names?
20:25:44 <Phoebe> but my cat is telling me to go to sleep
20:25:49 <geheimdienst> i'd have lambdabot tell chrisdone, but since she's down ...
20:26:10 <Llyr> I'm making my own algebraic data type deriving Show. Can I write my own show function that shows it in a different way?
20:26:13 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yay!
20:26:23 <pastorn> http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Haskell <-- the examples are getting great
20:26:32 <Eduard_Munteanu> Llyr: you'd make an instance of Show then.
20:26:35 <heatsink> Llyr, yes.  Have you made class instances before?
20:26:35 <Cale> Llyr: You can only have one instance of Show, so you can't use deriving if you're going to write your own.
20:26:41 <pastorn> let_in is a cool function :)
20:27:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> Wow, Haskell on Uncyclopedia, must read.
20:27:12 <Llyr> I suppose that I don't quite know enough here to phrase my question intelligently.
20:27:18 <monochrom> when lambdabot comes, people netsplit
20:27:31 <geheimdienst> pastorn, did anything change on the page? "examples are getting good"?
20:27:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> Llyr: you phrased it well enough.
20:27:47 <pastorn> geheimdienst: last time i checke let_in wasn't there
20:27:50 <geheimdienst> i've looked at it a few months back, and was blown away :) it's really great
20:27:58 <pastorn> and neither that nice type signature for pSwitch
20:28:00 <geheimdienst> most of the stuff even compiles
20:28:03 <Llyr> Eduard_Munteanu: How would I go about making an instance of Show?
20:28:49 <haskell_rascal_> so have you heard the word?
20:28:54 <Eduard_Munteanu> Llyr: well it's instance Show MyData where show x = ...
20:28:58 <nomad> whats the word..
20:29:02 <haskell_rascal_> bird
20:29:09 <nomad> bbbb bird is the word..
20:29:10 <haskell_rascal_> b.b...b.b.b.b.b.
20:29:12 <nomad> haha
20:29:14 <Eduard_Munteanu> LOL
20:29:20 <dolio> Richard Bird?
20:29:24 <Llyr> Eduard_Munteanu: Okay, thanks. I'll start playing with that.
20:29:27 <haskell_rascal_> so what are you guys working on in her>
20:29:28 <heatsink> Llyr: after the "instance Show MyData where", you define show like you'd define any other function
20:29:28 <nomad> guess there are more family guy lovers out there than I thought
20:29:33 <haskell_rascal_> *here?
20:29:51 <pastorn> "public class ExampleCode extends Java throws EveryExceptionUnderTheSUN" <-- from the java page :D
20:30:04 <mm_freak> http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nonfunctional_programming
20:30:05 <mm_freak> lol
20:30:11 <geheimdienst> http://haskellfamily.org/
20:30:20 <haskell_rascal_> nope,,, just a fan of guys
20:30:23 <haskell_rascal_> and old songs
20:30:27 <Llyr> Is the newline character \n?
20:30:31 <haskell_rascal_> nomad
20:31:06 <haskell_rascal_> so is there a community project you all are working on?
20:31:18 <haskell_rascal_> a main goal or purpose using Haskell
20:31:24 <Cale> Llyr: yep
20:31:43 <monochrom> the project is world domination
20:31:48 <haskell_rascal_> cool
20:31:52 <Eduard_Munteanu> haskell_rascal_: no, everybody is here for his own reasons.
20:31:57 <haskell_rascal_> I want in monochrom
20:31:58 <geheimdienst> but first of all, make an awesome window manager
20:33:04 <geheimdienst> this step of the world-domination plan has already succeeded
20:33:05 <Saizan> geheimdienst: that's been done already in another language, no?
20:33:06 <haskell_rascal_> so does haskell work with windows and linux?
20:33:08 <haskell_rascal_> and apple?
20:33:13 <haskell_newb> if fst == first.. how do you get last (in a tuple) ?
20:33:24 <Cale> haskell_rascal_: yes
20:33:28 <Eduard_Munteanu> Heh, Gonads...
20:33:29 <etpace> is there a group but doesn't care where they are in the list? so group (==) [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1] = [[1,1],[2,2],..] etc
20:33:32 <haskell_rascal_> thanks Cale

20:34:20 <djahandarie> Lambdabot is back
20:34:29 <heatsink> etpace: You can sort before using group 
20:34:33 <pastorn> @botsnack

20:34:42 <haskell_rascal_> who is lambdabot?
20:34:48 <nomad> sorry was away.. no I am not hooked on to one right now
20:34:48 <Cale> haskell_rascal_: Probably not, though it's possible to get things running on an iPhone or iPod touch.
20:34:50 <nomad> but would love to
20:34:51 <pastorn> haskell_rascal_: the awesome bot :)
20:34:53 <Eduard_Munteanu> @vixen Meet haskell_rascal_.
20:34:53 <lambdabot> Ooh, functional programmers are so hot!
20:34:57 <Eduard_Munteanu> haskell_rascal_: meet lambdabot 
20:35:14 <pastorn> @faq Can haskell drag too many people in here?
20:35:14 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:35:15 <haskell_rascal_> Helo lambdabot
20:35:40 <haskell_rascal_> Hello lambadabot. it is nice to meet you
20:35:59 <geheimdienst> > Hello lambadabot. it is nice to meet you
20:36:00 <lambdabot>   Not in scope: data constructor `Hello'Not in scope: `lambadabot'Not in scop...
20:36:12 <_genova> hi
20:36:18 <geheimdienst> lambdabot, someone should work with you on your social skills a little
20:36:31 <haskell_rascal_> Hi lambdabot ?
20:36:53 <pastorn> > take 5 ['a'..]
20:36:54 <lambdabot>   "abcde"
20:36:56 <Eduard_Munteanu> @vixen Be polite and wave to haskell_rascal_
20:36:56 <lambdabot> church is my favourite computer scientist.
20:37:03 <haskell_rascal_> Lambdabot, are you a troll or something?
20:37:07 <_genova> can someone list? popular program/software writen in haskell?
20:37:25 <geheimdienst> xmonad, darcs
20:37:30 <Cale> http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html
20:37:30 <heatsink> > "No haskell_rascal_, I'm not a troll, I just love Haskell"
20:37:31 <lambdabot>   "No haskell_rascal_, I'm not a troll, I just love Haskell"
20:37:33 <Eduard_Munteanu> Sure, there was a list on the wiki.
20:37:56 <Cale> (that leaves out the 'popular' qualifier, but it lists a bunch of software :)
20:38:11 <Eduard_Munteanu> Well, yeah.
20:38:24 <Cale> I mean, the Hackage link :)
20:38:55 <Gracenotes> I think xmonad was the most downloaded as of a year ago
20:38:58 <haskell_rascal_> can you use haskell to Hax0r people
20:39:19 <haskell_rascal_> and to backtrace them to get the CyberPolice after them?
20:39:32 <geheimdienst> @faq can you use haskell to hask0rz people?
20:39:32 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:39:37 <monochrom> that involves solving the halting problem
20:39:43 <Gracenotes> oh, reminds me, are you around, dons?
20:39:51 <arw> @faq can haskell solve the halting problem?
20:39:51 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:39:57 <arw> monochrom: there...
20:40:21 <haskell_rascal_> Haskell is amazing and is afraid of anything
20:40:22 <Eduard_Munteanu> I meant http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Projects
20:40:27 <Eduard_Munteanu> They're nicely categorized in there.
20:40:27 <ddarius> http://catseye.tc/gallery/languages/sartre/
20:40:29 <monochrom> it also involves compiling those who don't compile themselves...
20:40:35 <Gracenotes> dons: do you have per-day download statistics available (just a histogram for each day)?
20:40:56 <MrStamp> @faq can Haskell do that?
20:40:57 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:41:13 <Gracenotes> from the apache logs.. I know you guys wrote a parsing program, once
20:41:55 <Eduard_Munteanu> ddarius: lol
20:42:00 <haskell_rascal_> @faq Can Haskell walk your dog and pick up any doodie mess for you?
20:42:00 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:42:28 <haskell_rascal_> WOW
20:42:50 <Gracenotes> RIP haskell the dog
20:43:36 <haskell_rascal_> @faq Can Haskell find me a girlfriend?
20:43:36 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
20:43:44 <haskell_rascal_> SWEET!
20:43:55 <haskell_rascal_> I am so learning how to program haskel now
20:44:22 <haskell_rascal_> So does anyone program AI here?
20:44:28 <geheimdienst> (caveat: the girlfriends haskell finds for people usually have a neckbeard)
20:44:44 <haskell_rascal_> lol geheimdiest
20:45:00 <haskell_rascal_> *geheimdienst
20:45:03 <dons> Gracenotes: for haskell?
20:45:04 <Eduard_Munteanu> @vixen Would you date haskell_rascal_ ?
20:45:04 <lambdabot> church is my favourite computer scientist.
20:45:23 <haskell_rascal_> @vixen ;) ;) you're cute
20:45:24 <lambdabot> others have told me i'm very pretty
20:45:26 <Veinor> yay, lambdabot is back!
20:45:40 <Gracenotes> dons: for hackage downloads, #-per-package-per-day
20:45:57 <Cale> Well, Haskell didn't find me a girlfriend, but three of my girlfriends have been Haskell programmers.
20:46:13 <haskell_rascal_> How can I make my own bot that gives my own typical answers?
20:46:33 <haskell_rascal_> People on Facebook bug me and want to chat... but I don't want to talk to the all the time
20:46:37 <Gracenotes> dons: I think it's the granularity I'm going with for automatically recording tarball downloads (and happstack still produces apache-style logs, so)
20:46:39 <haskell_rascal_> but I still like them...
20:46:56 <Gracenotes> dons: so legacy data is a large part of that, we don't want to start from 0 :)
20:47:06 <Cale> My solution to that is not to maintain a Facebook account.
20:47:08 <Eduard_Munteanu> That's interesting, Cale.
20:47:28 <monochrom> I want three girlfriends too.
20:47:40 <ddarius> monochrom: Why just three?
20:47:41 <dons> Gracenotes: hmm. we could publish per-day downloads
20:47:48 <haskell_rascal_> or my GF is boring me and she still wants to talk
20:47:58 <monochrom> because the four of us can then play bridge
20:48:00 <Cale> If people really want to get in touch with me, they will use IRC. :)
20:48:28 <haskell_rascal_> I want a bot set up to answer a bunch of her same inane questions like " So whatcha thinkin bout?"
20:48:43 <Gracenotes> dons: or even if they're not published explicitly, they might make nice sparkline graphs, that sort of thing
20:49:12 * geheimdienst wonders how many girlfriends cale has had. considering the number of haskell programmers are hm, let's say .001%, you need to randomly select 300,000 women to have 3 haskell programmers among them. cale must have quite the social life.
20:49:34 <haskell_rascal_> @lamdabot Can you do that?
20:49:34 <lambdabot> Unknown command, try @list
20:49:48 <geheimdienst> it might be more manageable if you have multiple girlfriends concurrently
20:49:59 <haskell_rascal_> lambdabot can you make a copy of yourself?
20:50:10 <geheimdienst> however as we all know, concurrency is hard if you don't pay attention
20:50:49 <monochrom> like "you are a shared variable"? :)
20:50:52 <CakeProphet> > "this is a test"
20:50:53 <lambdabot>   "this is a test"
20:50:54 <aavogt> geheimdienst: except it's not a random selection
20:50:55 <CakeProphet> yes!
20:51:06 <haskell_rascal_> ok, back to my lessons
20:51:15 <ddarius> geheimdienst: Which you do is distribute and replicate so you can transparently recover from any failures.
20:51:20 <haskell_rascal_> what did you do CakePropeht?
20:52:10 <geheimdienst> ddarius, what constitutes failure and transparent recovery in our context?
20:52:35 <monochrom> you are like an MVar. if one girlfriend has taken you out, another girlfriend will block when she tries to take you out...
20:52:35 <Gracenotes> hm. so  -continues coding-
20:53:04 <CakeProphet> monochrom:  ........
20:53:05 <ddarius> monochrom: I suspect they poll and then give up after a timeout has expired, though some certainly block.
20:53:16 <monochrom> yeah
20:53:49 <monochrom> concurrency dating is hard
20:53:59 <ddarius> Indeed, double dating threatens deadlock.
20:54:08 <geheimdienst> the girlfriends could use a pool, using whichever guy becomes available. this should at least ease the bottleneck
20:54:13 <monochrom> to make it easier: cabal install dating-parallel
20:55:35 <monochrom> haha, there is a monad-parallel, maybe it's a good start
20:55:47 <Haskell_Rascal> I just wrote my first tuple
20:56:37 <CakeProphet> geheimdienst:  a swinger pool?
20:56:49 <CakeProphet> wouldn't emotions get corrupted?
20:57:23 <Jafet> Cake: only if they unsafePerformIO
20:58:02 <monochrom> unsafeInterleaveIO
20:58:03 <geheimdienst> "hey babe, how about some IO action? i guarantee you it won't have any side-effects"
20:58:39 <CakeProphet> ...hahahaha
21:01:20 <CakeProphet> the philosophical viewpoint of determinism kind of reminds me of referential transparency
21:03:40 <CakeProphet> Haskell_Rascal: your first tuple, you say?
21:04:15 <CakeProphet> ah. whowas. :)
21:04:37 <handonson> so, with MVars, when the thread try to takeMVar to an empty MVar, it falls asleep and the runtime system will wake it up when the MVar becomes available. does the same apply to Chans too?
21:05:01 <CakeProphet> handonson:  believe so.
21:05:21 <CakeProphet> handonson:  in the original paper Chan was constructed via linked MVars. Might be true in the Haskell implementation as well.
21:05:28 <RenJuan> Oh cake prophet, which cake is your nick about?
21:05:44 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> I was wondering the same thing
21:05:52 <CakeProphet> RenJuan:  none in particular. It can generally be interpreted a number of ways. :)
21:06:10 <RenJuan> but specifically not about PHP?
21:06:20 <geheimdienst> > cake
21:06:21 <lambdabot>   ["One 18.25 ounce package chocolate cake mix.","One can prepared coconut pe...
21:06:24 <CakeProphet> various pop cultural things. The genesis of the name came before any such notion.
21:06:43 <RenJuan> Acknowledged.
21:06:51 <CakeProphet> RenJuan:  er... no. I don't know anything about PHP. :P
21:07:19 <Eduard_Munteanu> Mmm, I think somebody thought of implementing that completely non-functional programming language: http://esolangs.org/wiki/Nil
21:07:24 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> Is Haskell pretty similar to Perl?
21:07:28 <Eduard_Munteanu> I think geheimdienst mentioned it.
21:07:33 <RenJuan> i just learned it's nothing more than a MVC package for php
21:07:59 <CakeProphet> LOL_I_TROLL_U:  in some ways, yes. More so with Perl 6.
21:08:28 <djahandarie> One of the Perl 6 compilers was actually made in Haskell
21:08:48 <RenJuan> haskell is not like perl. If it were, cabal would work like cpan and it dunnit
21:08:52 <Daenyth> Isn't that the implementation language for parrot?
21:08:56 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> I think that is cool, but kind of funny. Why didn't they use Perl to make it?
21:09:02 * Eduard_Munteanu thinks a CAS would be a fine thing to have written in Haskell
21:09:10 <Daenyth> LOL_I_TROLL_U: yapsi is hosted in perl6 ;)
21:09:17 <Daenyth> IIRC
21:09:17 <Eduard_Munteanu> Maxima seems to be leveraging Lisp well.
21:09:29 <djahandarie> LOL_I_TROLL_U, because Perl 6 didn't exist yet and I don't think they wanted to use an older version
21:09:47 <djahandarie> I don't know the exact details behind it
21:09:58 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> Ah, I see. Thanks guys
21:10:16 <Eduard_Munteanu> Well, symbolic CAS that is.
21:10:29 <djahandarie> More Haskell stuff on the frontpage
21:10:35 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> There are just so many choices to program in. It's can get rather confusing.
21:10:40 <djahandarie> How would you write "du" in Haskell? (self.haskell)
21:11:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> du?
21:11:31 <arw> disk usage.
21:11:43 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah, the Unix cmdline utility?
21:11:44 <arw> recursively sum up all file sizes in a directory tree.
21:12:34 <djahandarie> I'm not asking that question btw, it was a reddit thread
21:12:49 <djahandarie> There are some pretty damn good answers on it too :)
21:12:53 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> So who would win in a fight? Haskell, Perl, Ruby, or C++
21:13:09 <Philippa> Haskell's immune to the other language's effects
21:13:15 <Philippa> languages', rather
21:13:24 <flippo> Eduard_Munteanu, somebody pointed out that Nil is the perfect programming language for cats.
21:13:46 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> Nil? I'll have to give that a try
21:13:49 <Eduard_Munteanu> flippo: no way, there's lolcode for cats.
21:14:17 <flippo> Eduard_Munteanu, I think that is just for cat owners.
21:14:27 <Eduard_Munteanu> Ah, that's a point :)
21:15:22 <danderson> Torrents up for the new Haskell Platform release, both win32 and OS X. Please help seed if you have bandwidth, so that hackage doesn't get crushed when the release is announced: http://natulte.net/random/HaskellPlatform-2010.2.0.0-setup.exe.torrent http://natulte.net/random/haskell-platform-2010.2.0.0.i386.dmg.torrent
21:15:41 <Jafet> Why would hackage be "crushed"?
21:16:02 <danderson> because historically, it gets DoSed for 2 days on every Platform release
21:16:13 <gwern> arw: first I would figure out how to get a list of filenames; then map some sort of getFileSize on the list; then sum it
21:16:14 <danderson> that's why we started providing the large installers over bittorrent in the first place :)
21:16:16 <gwern> @hoogle FileSize
21:16:17 <lambdabot> System.IO hFileSize :: Handle -> IO Integer
21:16:17 <lambdabot> System.IO hSetFileSize :: Handle -> Integer -> IO ()
21:16:19 <gwern> @hoogle sum
21:16:19 <lambdabot> Prelude sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
21:16:19 <lambdabot> Data.Foldable sum :: (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
21:16:19 <lambdabot> Data.List sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
21:16:26 <Jafet> Ah, you mean in the otherwise case
21:16:46 <gwern> arw: however, reimplmenting 'find' isn't that easy... I think RWH has a section on this, and there is no doubt a lib on hacvkage to do that
21:18:11 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> So I was interested in working with a microcontroller. Can Haskell handle that?
21:18:28 <Jafet> danderson: but I don't see the torrents referenced on the haskell website -- is that planned? (Was looking for linux packages)
21:18:29 <gwern> ...that is a trick question, I just know it
21:18:52 <danderson> Jafet: the release isn't out yet, this is just preseeding to get some bandwidth before the release goes out
21:19:12 <Cale> LOL_I_TROLL_U: There are people using Haskell as a sort of higher-level assembler to program microcontrollers, from what I understand.
21:19:13 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> lamdabot, can haskell be used with microcontrollers?
21:19:14 <Philippa> directly not so much, but if you use it as a metalanguage for something the microcontroller'll run it'd make a nice typed alternative to FORTH
21:19:21 <danderson> Jafet: dons is preparing the release, I just help out with the torrents.
21:19:25 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> thanks Cale
21:19:29 <Cale> LOL_I_TROLL_U: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom
21:19:35 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> You're very helpful
21:19:51 <Daenyth> How should I lay out my haskell projects on disk? If I do something like {libs/, sub_1/, sub_2/, ...} is there a good way to make each subproject able to import from libs/? (haskell newbie here)
21:20:08 <gwern> Daenyth: do everything in cabal?
21:20:08 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> I've got a BASICstamp
21:20:20 <pastorn> Daenyth: if you have a library that you want globally available, use cabal
21:20:30 <wwwtyro> wow!
21:20:33 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> but I don't want to use BASIC to program it. Would you guys recommend Haskell?
21:20:41 <Daenyth> gwern: I'll have a look at that. Not intending to distributre anything, just stuff I'd be putting together for my project euler stuff
21:20:48 <pastorn> write your lib, run cabal (with magic parameters) to initialize it there, then install it
21:20:54 <geheimdienst> daenyth, you can just type "cabal init" and it will ask you a few questions. it's really friendly and painless. from then on, "cabal install" and you're kinda done
21:20:57 <gwern> Daenyth: it'll make life easier, quite likely
21:20:58 <Daenyth> distribute^
21:21:03 <Eduard_Munteanu> I doubt Haskell can get anywhere near lower-level languages in terms of lean code.
21:21:04 <mtnviewmark> Daenyth: I put a "src" dir at the root of my project, and then treat that dir as the root of a module tree
21:21:09 <gwern> even if you don't intend to distribute it
21:21:12 <ksf> bloomier filters!
21:21:15 <Daenyth> hrm
21:21:22 <geheimdienst> "cabal init" once for each of your projects, that is
21:21:23 <pastorn> Daenyth: probably it will go to ~/.cabal/ and from there will be importable on that system
21:21:27 <gwern> Eduard_Munteanu: lies, jhc makes a competitive hello world! :)
21:21:43 <Daenyth> gwern: Is there much overhead in doing it like that? I'm just intending stuff for my euler attempts really
21:21:44 <Zeiris> Daenyth, take a quick look at Leksah if you end up needing Cabal. It makes the process a lot easier.
21:21:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> gwern: well true, it fares better than GHC on that. I tried it once.
21:21:52 <gwern> Daenyth: overhead in what sense?
21:21:53 <Daenyth> overhead in regards to maintenance anyway
21:22:03 <Eduard_Munteanu> But the RTS is still goddamn big. :)
21:22:07 <Daenyth> since they'll probably be quite volatile..
21:22:10 <gwern> Eduard_Munteanu: well, having little to no runtime does help... although I don't know what jhc's GC story is right now
21:22:21 <Cale> LOL_I_TROLL_U: The idea would likely be to use Haskell as a metalanguage -- so you'd be writing Haskell programs which run to produce executable code for your microcontroller. It might be a bit of a large project to start with.
21:22:32 <Daenyth> In python I can just export PYTHONPATH and "import" will look under the dir I give... any way to get a similar effect?
21:22:35 <Zeiris> If you're just indenting stuff for Euler, I'd go with a directory hierarchy. Data.MyAbsDataType, and have MyAbsDataType.hs be in a folder called Data with the appropriate module declaration.
21:23:06 <Daenyth> Zeiris: sounds about right, that's what I'm doing now pretty much
21:23:36 <Daenyth> at least for my python version
21:23:37 <Zeiris> (Interestingly, I'm currently reading http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hierarchical_module_names)
21:23:43 <pastorn> heh, i'd just create Euler.hs which just reexports everything, so that i can get access to all my nifty functions in one import line
21:24:34 <dabblego> @pl \(_, a, b) -> a == b
21:24:34 <lambdabot> (line 1, column 7):
21:24:34 <lambdabot> unexpected ","

21:24:44 <lambdabot> ambiguous use of a non associative operator
21:24:54 <Daenyth> Any rate, I just made my first haskell program: http://github.com/Daenyth/Project-Euler/blob/master/haskell/1/euler1.hs
21:24:59 <pastorn> dabblego: i don't think she likes triples :(
21:25:05 <Daenyth> I feel like there must be a more succint way I could word that
21:25:06 <dabblego> boo
21:25:09 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> So why do you guys use IRC? Isn't there more modern chat clients you could use with more power? :)
21:25:10 <Eduard_Munteanu> I'd really wish there was some rebindable RTS, at least for House to bootstrap itself.
21:25:13 <pastorn> dabblego: indeed
21:25:14 <dabblego> @hoogle curry3
21:25:15 <lambdabot> No results found
21:25:18 <Eduard_Munteanu> Instead of hacking GHC.
21:25:25 <pastorn> LOL_I_TROLL_U: U TROLL
21:25:27 <ksf> we don't have unboxed Word128, do we?
21:25:43 <Daenyth> How might I compress that a bit so it's not so verbose?
21:25:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> In #haskell, pastorn trolls U :)
21:25:53 <pastorn> :D
21:26:38 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> see, if you troll too hard immediately.... you get the boot immediately
21:26:49 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> you've got to work the crowd up for it
21:27:02 <ksf> yeah.
21:27:03 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> then it is more a form of "intertainment"
21:27:04 <pastorn> obvious troll is obvious
21:27:14 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> purposely so
21:27:16 <danderson> and this isn't ##reddit
21:27:21 <ksf> you have to keep the troll at bay before you can asplode his brain.
21:27:22 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> I'm looking for others
21:27:33 <Eduard_Munteanu> Now I see... IRC is a chat client.

21:31:05 <rubber> re
21:31:05 <newsham> ?bot
21:31:06 <lambdabot> :)
21:31:08 <handonson> so, with MVars, when the thread try to takeMVar to an empty MVar, it falls asleep and the runtime system will wake it up when the MVar becomes available. does the same apply to Chans too?
21:31:46 <LOL_I_TROLL_U> ?bot
21:31:46 <lambdabot> :)
21:31:58 <rubber> i understand smart people are here. this isn't a haskell question proper, but a general one. if A is the parent of B which is the parent of C, would C's lineage include A B and C itself? or only A and B
21:32:20 <jmreardon> Daenyth: you could replace "wanted" easily with just a boolean expression
21:32:22 <newsham> > map ((iterate (succ.) id)!!13) "abc"
21:32:23 <lambdabot>   "nop"
21:32:27 <rubber> speaking in a broad sense of "lineage". from logic to biology
21:32:43 <geheimdienst> > map ((iterate (succ.) id)!!13) "nop"
21:32:44 <lambdabot>   "{|}"
21:32:45 <Daenyth> jmreardon: I thought so, but I'm still learning the syntax. How would I do it?
21:32:50 <pastorn> handonson: i use this to empty out a Chan:
21:32:51 <pastorn> exhaust test f = do
21:32:53 <rubber> anyone?
21:32:53 <pastorn>     b <- test
21:32:55 <pastorn>     if b then return [] else liftM2 (:) f (exhaust test f)
21:33:17 <jmreardon> well, testing one would be like: x `mod` 5 == 0
21:33:21 <handonson> no i mean
21:33:21 <arw> rubber: only A and B, but for no specific reason. i just wouldn't say something can be an element of its own lineage.
21:33:27 <pastorn> handonson: chanCont <- exhaust (isEmpty chan) (readChan chan)
21:33:37 <rubber> arw, that makes sense man, thank you
21:34:00 <handonson> if a thread attempts to read from a Chan which is empty, will it fall asleep and the runtime will wake it up when the Chan becomes available?
21:34:00 <pastorn> handonson: http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html
21:34:02 <jmreardon> Daenyth: and the boolean operations are like most languages
21:34:10 <pastorn> it says on that page which are blocking etc
21:34:35 <pastorn> handonson: i think so
21:34:38 <Daenyth> so something like filter (\x -> x `mod 5 == 0 && x `mod` 3 == 0) ...?
21:34:45 <newsham> http://pastebin.com/bRX6z9q3
21:35:03 <Daenyth> maybe a list comprehension would be more readable there...
21:35:09 <jmreardon> Daenyth: from my reading of the problem it should be an or (||)
21:35:18 <Daenyth> er yes, it should be
21:35:32 <jmreardon> Daenyth: ya, a list comprehension is very short and sweet
21:35:44 <handonson> pastorn: i've loaded that page up like 5 hours ago, couldn't find a definitive answer about the expected behavior of threads using Chan
21:35:46 <Eduard_Munteanu> > map (\x -> toEnum ((fromEnum $ toLower x - 84) mod 26) + 97) "abc"
21:35:47 <Daenyth> Can you do an or in a list comp, or are all the predicates and-ed?

21:35:47 <lambdabot>         against inf...
21:36:01 <Daenyth> or would I put one pred that has the || in it?
21:36:03 <Eduard_Munteanu> Meh.
21:36:17 <pastorn> handonson: looking at the source of Chan.hs shows that readChan uses readMVar and not takeMVar
21:36:26 <Eduard_Munteanu> > map (\x -> toEnum (((fromEnum $ toLower x - 84) mod 26) + 97)) "abc"

21:36:42 <markopolo> HASKELL IS FREAKIN AWESOME

21:36:57 <markopolo> sorry guys
21:37:03 <dons> arw: we don't have a pool of mirrors
21:37:15 <pastorn> handonson: and readMVar is a combination of takeMVar and putMVar, and takeMVar is blocking, so...

21:37:36 <Daenyth> jmreardon: aha
21:37:39 <Daenyth> thought so
21:38:34 <arw> dons: hm. if necessary, i could provide some space and bandwith. just tell me what to rsync :)

21:39:37 <lambdabot> The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.
21:40:01 <pastorn> geheimdienst: $ ghc-pkg hide monads-fd
21:40:15 <pastorn> geheimdienst: then restart ghci
21:40:47 <geheimdienst> thanks pastorn, that worked

21:56:17 <pastorn> is there some tool for generating a binary parser from something BNF-like?
21:56:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> ... and home run for the Yankees.
21:56:40 <danderson> pastorn: take a look at the binary and cereal packages on Hackage
21:56:57 <pastorn> danderson: yes, but i don't want to write the damn thing, i want it generated for me :D
21:57:05 <danderson> it's not BNF, but they define monads and helpers which greatly facilitate binary parsing/unparsing
21:57:29 <pastorn> danderson: i know, i've used it both for parsing .class files and TGA
21:57:38 <alex_kidd> is there a typical directory structure for a haskell project?
21:57:38 <portnov> > length $ replicateM 3 "abc"
21:57:39 <lambdabot>   27
21:57:59 <pastorn> danderson: i was thinking of mp3, but i don't want to write that manually :/
21:58:11 <danderson> pastorn: ah. Then, I think the answer is "no", I've only seen parser generators for text files
21:58:29 <lispy> pastorn: hmp3
21:58:42 <pastorn> alex_kidd: if you're going to have multiple *-ends of something, you usually do like this:
21:58:54 <danderson> I'm guessing you want something akin to an ASN.1 parser and code generator
21:59:03 <danderson> (well, except that ASN.1 is nasty)
21:59:07 <pastorn> Net/Backend0.hs Net/Backend1.hs ... then you have Net.hs which imports everything from Net/* and reexports it
21:59:34 <Eduard_Munteanu> Hm that's interesting, binary parsing in C is usually done by overlaying some struct over the data. How would you do it in Haskell, conceptually?
21:59:35 <pastorn> alex_kidd: that way, when you need it, you only have to import Net
21:59:43 <alex_kidd> pastorn: what do you mean by *-ends?
21:59:51 <pastorn> alex_kidd: back/front
21:59:56 <Gracenotes> .BackendPrime
22:00:05 <Gracenotes> usually they're called 'Internal' modules though

22:00:36 <ManateeLazyCat> GHC API can pick-up information from *.hi file that install on user's system? And don't care global/local database?
22:00:46 <alex_kidd> thanks
22:00:53 <pastorn> alex_kidd: also you'll notice that you often need to have some types available everywhere in your project, so unless you're doing business solutions, a Types.hs isn't too awfull
22:01:24 <pastorn> but if you can contain some types within a specific module, it's probably preferable, to not clutter up the namespace etc.
22:01:41 <tehgeekmeister> Cale: what?  three of your girlfriends have been haskell programmers?  lucky.  figures for you, tho. =P
22:01:54 <Eduard_Munteanu> Or is there some neat way of overlaying an ADT consisting of unboxed records on data?
22:01:58 <tehgeekmeister> is there an analog of ++ for bytestrings?  hoogle is failing me.
22:02:29 <dons> tehgeekmeister: concat or append
22:02:33 <Cale> :t Data.ByteString.append
22:02:33 <lambdabot> BSC.ByteString -> BSC.ByteString -> BSC.ByteString
22:02:41 <tehgeekmeister> thanks!
22:02:46 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Do you receive my patches?
22:02:49 <CakeProphet> flip replicateM ['a'..'z']  =<< [1..]
22:02:49 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: no?
22:02:51 <djahandarie> Also, mappend is the generalized version of that
22:02:54 <CakeProphet> > flip replicateM ['a'..'z']  =<< [1..]
22:02:55 <lambdabot>   ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s...
22:03:02 <CakeProphet> > flip replicateM ['a..'c']  =<< [1..]
22:03:03 <lambdabot>   <no location info>:
22:03:03 <lambdabot>      lexical error in string/character literal at chara...
22:03:03 <danderson> tehgeekmeister: also, if you want to go more general, ByteString is an instance of the Monoid typeclass
22:03:04 <djahandarie> > mappend "a" "b"
22:03:04 <lambdabot>   "ab"
22:03:12 <CakeProphet> > flip replicateM ['a'..'c']  =<< [1..]
22:03:13 <lambdabot>   ["a","b","c","aa","ab","ac","ba","bb","bc","ca","cb","cc","aaa","aab","aac"...
22:03:17 <Eduard_Munteanu> MonadPlus right?
22:03:18 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Isn't dons@galois.com ?
22:03:24 <danderson> which gives you mappend to append 2 ByteStrings, and mconcat to concat a list of them
22:03:26 <mwotton> oh, ouch. we get classed with intercal and brainfuck now?
22:03:30 <mwotton> http://www.focus.com/briefs/software-development/12-coding-languages/
22:03:40 <tehgeekmeister> danderson: more generality doesn't help me here, i don't think.
22:03:49 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: yes, but i've not seen any darcs patches?
22:03:53 <dons> or did you send them another way
22:04:21 * ManateeLazyCat pasted "hs-plugins patch." at http://paste2.org/get/923206
22:04:22 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Above is patch file that make hs-plugins work with Cabal-1.8
22:04:26 <danderson> tehgeekmeister: it helps to keep the slight generalities in mind, because the knowledge is transferrable to other types
22:04:43 <djahandarie> mwotton, seems like he likes it but just thinks it isn't/won't get popular
22:04:46 <danderson> but yeah, your code itself probably won't work on any monoid, so you don't need the generality per se.
22:04:51 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Now can compile with Cabal-1.8, but looks ghc-6.12.x broken hs-plugins.
22:04:57 <Eduard_Munteanu> mwotton: dunno what to say, AFAICT Haskell is growing slowly, but still growing. Much unlike the other stuff there.
22:05:08 <djahandarie> Maybe I could post a link to that hackage package count
22:05:11 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: I have test many demos under hs-plugins/testsuite, failed.
22:05:12 <tehgeekmeister> danderson: i'm explicitly working with strings, bytestrings are all i need.  unless this text type i just discovered is a worthy alternative?
22:05:12 <djahandarie> The graph
22:05:12 <evant_> What's the name people use for the "++" function?
22:05:21 <evant_> Say if I were googling it
22:05:39 <mtnviewmark> append
22:05:56 <mtnviewmark> but I wouldn't google it... I'd hoogle it!
22:06:01 <Eduard_Munteanu> Similarly, I think Delphi enjoys a rather large audience, maybe bigger than Haskell's.
22:06:02 <tehgeekmeister> since the channel seems a bit more serious now, i'm curious, how does one get strings (not literals) into attributes/content in blazehtml?
22:06:08 <Eduard_Munteanu> Or at least it did, but going down now.
22:06:23 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: ok. thanks
22:06:38 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Most error is "Main: ../Plugin.o: unknown symbol `integerzmgmp_GHCziInteger_smallInteger_closure' Main: user error (resolvedObjs failed.)"
22:06:40 <mwotton> Eduard_Munteanu: yeah, I don't think it's a very fair comparison - was just a surprise
22:06:52 <mwotton> feels a bit "but i'm not dead!" "you will be soon, get on the cart"
22:06:54 <djahandarie> dons, do you have a link to that graph of hackage package growth somewhere?
22:06:58 <evant_> Is it also a named function?
22:07:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yeah. It's a bit stupid to pair up Brainfuck and other non-serious stuff with Delphi.
22:08:02 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Looks hs-plugins' can't parse *.hi file correctly with ghc-6.12.x
22:08:18 <pikhq> Eduard_Munteanu: Brainfuck is very serious. Serious fun, that is.
22:08:23 <danderson> tehgeekmeister: ByteStrings are usually a good starting point for (non-unicode) strings. My point was more that keeping the functions of the major type classes in mind will help with the "what's the name of the function that does blah?" problem
22:08:27 <cncl> event_ ++ is its name, but the equivalent is mappend from the Functor typeclass
22:08:33 <cncl> er evant_ 
22:08:36 <djahandarie> Functor?
22:08:40 <cncl> er
22:08:40 <djahandarie> Definitely not
22:08:41 <cncl> monoid
22:08:44 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: ok.
22:08:45 <evant_> Cheers
22:08:47 <cncl> hyuk
22:08:49 <dons> djahandarie: on my blog
22:08:51 <cncl> i'm smart.
22:08:59 <tehgeekmeister> danderson: oh, yes, that's for sure.  i plan on restarting the typeclassopedia soon, since i'm back to haskell land again.  hopefully for a long stay this time.
22:09:06 <Eduard_Munteanu> pikhq: I suppose that's one way of putting it :)
22:09:09 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Do you have time fix this? I'm not familiar with your code.
22:09:10 <evant_> I'm trying to write some of the base functions from scratch because I haven't done this in a while :0
22:09:14 <djahandarie> dons, yeah, I just found it, thanks
22:09:15 <dons> djahandarie: http://donsbot.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/there-are-a-hell-of-a-lot-of-haskell-libraries-now-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it/
22:09:28 <danderson> tehgeekmeister: aah, the typeclassopedia. Good times. Enjoy the ride.
22:09:32 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: i will, but not today.
22:09:55 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: Ok, thanks
22:10:13 <tehgeekmeister> danderson: wait, then is there a better choice for unicode strings?  much of what i'm processing is nonunicode, but i'm converting it all to unicode.
22:10:28 <pikhq> tehgeekmeister: String
22:10:51 <tehgeekmeister> pikhq: even when efficiency is a big deal?
22:10:54 <danderson> String isn't so hot on performance though. Dunno what you'd want for both Unicode and performance.
22:11:07 <djahandarie> ByteString.UTF8
22:11:15 <pikhq> Ah, right.
22:11:17 <magcius> Been meaning to learn Haskell for a little while.
22:11:31 <magcius> I was going through Try Haskell
22:11:34 <tolkad> Is it possible to pattern match for a constructor without explicitly naming it? for example f (_ (x :: Int) (y :: Int) :: T) which I would expect match all constructors for type T with two parameters of type Int and Int
22:11:53 <magcius> For step 22 ( http://tryhaskell.org/?#22 )
22:12:02 <pikhq> magcius: I highly recommend it.
22:12:12 <magcius> is there a reason fst (snd (10, "abc")) won't work?
22:12:27 <pastorn> > snd (10, "abc")
22:12:28 <lambdabot>   "abc"
22:12:34 <pikhq> magcius: Sure. "abc" is not a tuple.
22:12:35 <danderson> magcius: it works fine, but the instructions said to use pattern matching :)
22:12:41 <cncl> magcius: fst and snd are for the tuple type, "abc" is a list of chars
22:12:42 <pikhq> What you want is head.
22:12:43 <pastorn> magcius: "abc" is a list, not a pair
22:12:44 <danderson> well, that and s/fst/head/
22:12:46 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: fst/snd only applies to pairs
22:12:50 <magcius> hm
22:12:56 <pastorn> @type fst -- magcius 
22:12:57 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a, b) -> a
22:13:03 <pikhq> @type head
22:13:04 <lambdabot> forall a. [a] -> a
22:13:05 <pastorn> @type "abc"
22:13:05 * tehgeekmeister is always amazed at how easy it is to switch datatypes in haskell
22:13:06 <lambdabot> [Char]
22:13:18 <magcius> It didn't really say how to define functions here.
22:13:22 <magcius> It just used a funky let syntax.
22:13:35 <jj3> well
22:13:38 <pikhq> let foo a b c = bar in baz
22:13:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: well for one liners let is enough
22:13:49 <cncl> tolkad: no i don't think so
22:13:59 <magcius> I still don't know how to read the multiple arrow thing
22:14:15 <magcius> It's like functions with multiple parameters, right?
22:14:16 <pikhq> magcius: What, a -> b -> c ?
22:14:16 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: what do you mean, >> ?
22:14:20 <cncl> a -> (b -> (c -> d))
22:14:23 <magcius> yeah
22:14:37 <pastorn> magcius: (a -> b -> c) is a function that takes two arguments, one of type 'a' and one of type 'b' and returns a 'c'
22:14:41 <danderson> a -> b reads "takes an a and returns a b"
22:14:46 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: think of it as a partial application. You have f with two args.
22:14:49 <magcius> yeah
22:14:50 <tehgeekmeister> anyone know how one gets strings (or bytestrings, or text, or whatever else) into blazehtml?  not literals, that's working already.
22:14:51 <magcius> I got that
22:14:54 <pastorn> @type drop
22:14:55 <lambdabot> forall a. Int -> [a] -> [a]
22:14:55 <danderson> a -> b -> c reads "takes an a and a b, and returns a c"
22:14:55 <djahandarie> Except we can't call it "return", guys
22:14:57 <magcius> where are a and b defined as types?
22:15:00 <djahandarie> Remember where else that is used?
22:15:03 <pastorn> > drop 2 "hello"
22:15:04 <lambdabot>   "llo"
22:15:04 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: but you can apply f partially to one argument.
22:15:09 <danderson> or alternatively, "takes an a and returns a function which takes a b and returns a c"
22:15:11 <pikhq> magcius: They aren't.
22:15:12 * hackagebot functor-combo 0.0.1 - Functor combinators with tries & zippers  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combo-0.0.1 (ConalElliott)
22:15:13 <magcius> Eduard_Munteanu: right, so you return a function
22:15:21 <magcius> > :t fst
22:15:22 <lambdabot>   <no location info>: parse error on input `:'
22:15:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: yes.
22:15:28 <pikhq> magcius: A lower-case string in a type declaration means "any type".
22:15:30 <magcius> argh
22:15:33 <magcius> pikhq: ahhh
22:15:40 <CakeProphet> :t fst
22:15:40 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a, b) -> a
22:15:42 <magcius> pikhq: again, Try Haskell didn't make these things clear
22:15:46 <Eduard_Munteanu> :t div
22:15:47 <lambdabot> forall a. (Integral a) => a -> a -> a
22:15:51 <Eduard_Munteanu> :t (div 3)
22:15:52 <lambdabot> forall t. (Integral t) => t -> t
22:15:59 <pikhq> If it's the same string for multiple bits, then it's the same type for all those instances.
22:16:07 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: now you can apply (div 3) to whatever you want
22:16:15 <ManateeLazyCat> dons: BTW, i suggest use GHC-API replace hs-plugins code to parse *.hi file, then hs-plugins will keep forward-compatible.
22:16:21 <magcius> Eduard_Munteanu: right
22:16:41 <CakeProphet> what's the most ridiculous type signature we could show magicus right now? Just to scare him. :)
22:16:42 <Eduard_Munteanu> > (div 12) 3
22:16:43 <lambdabot>   4
22:16:48 <pikhq> And the (Foo bar) => ... stuff indicates which typeclass that your bar is from.
22:17:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> CakeProphet: the zygohistomorphic prepromorphism is pretty mean
22:17:15 <magcius> Anyway.
22:17:17 <CakeProphet> :t runState
22:17:18 <lambdabot> forall s a. State s a -> s -> (a, s)
22:17:33 <pikhq> That's not the crazy one
22:17:34 <djahandarie> :t runST
22:17:34 <magcius> pikhq: so (Foo bar) means that bar is of type Foo in a type declaration?
22:17:35 <lambdabot> forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -> a
22:17:40 <pikhq> djahandarie: There.
22:17:45 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yay, rank 2
22:17:55 <dons> ManateeLazyCat: yes, that's the  best idea.
22:17:59 <djahandarie> Although I don't know why the objective here is to scare people
22:18:02 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: not really.
22:18:05 <pikhq> magcius: No, (Foo bar) => means that bar is of any type of typeclass Foo.
22:18:17 <magcius> I'm not really scared, as I don't know how to read that
22:18:20 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: there are groups of types, the typeclasses.
22:18:32 * djahandarie pops up wearing a monster mask
22:18:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> Like things you can compare, things that are numbers etc.
22:18:44 <magcius> Eduard_Munteanu: I'm confused. Isn't strict, strict static typing the whole point of Haskell?
22:18:48 <CakeProphet> magicman:  an example of a typeclass is Eq. All types that are members of Eq define the equality operators.
22:18:52 <CakeProphet> :t (==)
22:18:53 <lambdabot> forall a. (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
22:18:57 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: yes, but it's also polymorphic
22:19:01 <pikhq> magcius: We also have well-defined polymorphism.
22:19:04 <magcius> ah
22:19:30 <tehgeekmeister> if quickcheck isn't compiled with profiling that means i need to reinstall ghc, right?  that's one of the built in libraries, isn't it?
22:19:37 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: so those functions say "we take any argument as long as it's of class Eq", for example. Then they can apply comparison operators to them.
22:19:41 <CakeProphet> magicman:  that's why you can do "Hello" == "World", but also do 2 == 2
22:19:49 <pikhq> :t (>>=)
22:19:50 <lambdabot> forall (m :: * -> *) a b. (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
22:19:57 * pikhq whistles innocently
22:20:03 <CakeProphet> pikhq:  not yet. :P
22:20:11 <Eduard_Munteanu> @hoogle DiffArray
22:20:12 <lambdabot> Data.Array.Diff type DiffArray = IOToDiffArray IOArray
22:20:12 <lambdabot> Data.Array.Diff data IOToDiffArray a i e
22:20:12 <lambdabot> Data.Array.Diff newDiffArray :: (MArray a e IO, Ix i) => (i, i) -> [(Int, e)] -> IO (IOToDiffArray a i e)
22:20:15 <djahandarie> Now all we need is a rank 2 monad
22:20:17 * Eduard_Munteanu *hides*
22:20:24 <pikhq> djahandarie: o.O
22:20:25 <pikhq> Eduard_Munteanu: Hah.
22:20:51 <CakeProphet> pikhq:  I remember struggling over monads. They're so simple now that I understand. :P
22:21:30 <magcius> ok
22:21:37 <magcius> third question
22:21:44 <magcius> > 'a' : 'b'
22:21:45 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `[GHC.Types.Char]'
22:21:45 <lambdabot>         against inferred ty...
22:21:48 <magcius> > 'a' : 'b' : []
22:21:49 <lambdabot>   "ab"
22:21:55 <magcius> why does one work and not the other?
22:21:59 <CakeProphet> :t 'b'
22:22:00 <lambdabot> Char
22:22:01 <CakeProphet> :t []
22:22:02 <danderson> :t (:)
22:22:02 <lambdabot> forall a. [a]
22:22:02 <pikhq> :t (:)
22:22:03 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]
22:22:03 <lambdabot> forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]
22:22:08 <djahandarie> lol
22:22:13 <magcius> uh what?
22:22:18 <magcius> what the hell is forall
22:22:23 <djahandarie> Ignore the forall
22:22:24 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: ignore it
22:22:31 <djahandarie> That should seriously be turned off
22:22:32 <cncl> > ('a' : 'b') : []
22:22:33 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `[GHC.Types.Char]'
22:22:33 <lambdabot>         against inferred ty...
22:22:34 <pikhq> magcius: It's a GHC extension; ignore it.
22:22:43 <cncl> > 'a' : ('b' : [])
22:22:44 <lambdabot>   "ab"
22:22:46 <cncl> that's why
22:23:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: read the type signature. It says it takes something and a list of that something's.
22:23:10 <magcius> ahh
22:23:12 <magcius> so
22:23:16 <magcius> > 'a' : "b"
22:23:17 <lambdabot>   "ab"
22:23:21 <danderson> exactly
22:23:21 <pikhq> Yes.
22:23:36 <djahandarie> Precisely!
22:23:46 <magcius> I'm curious what a -> [a] -> [a] could mean
22:23:52 <magcius> it seems slightly ambigious in that contxt
22:23:56 <CakeProphet> magicman:  it's also right-associative. That means, when you string mutliple :'s together, there are implied parenthesis (1 : ( 2 : []))
22:24:01 <magcius> yes
22:24:04 <magcius> I got that
22:24:10 <pikhq> It takes an "a", a list of "a"s, and returns a list of "a"s.
22:24:23 <djahandarie> return return return
22:24:23 <pikhq> [a] is a list of "a"s.
22:24:30 <magcius> pikhq: where a is a type?
22:24:37 <pikhq> magcius: Yes.
22:24:39 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: any type
22:24:43 <magcius> because
22:24:45 <magcius> :t fst
22:24:46 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a, b) -> a
22:24:52 <CakeProphet> magicman:  and only one type. a list can contain only one type.
22:24:55 <magcius> seemed to say something about the implementation
22:25:13 <CakeProphet> @djinn (a,b) -> a
22:25:13 <lambdabot> f (a, _) = a
22:25:17 <cncl> magcius: keep in mind that (a, b) could be (Integer, Char), but also (Integer, Integer)
22:25:22 <magcius> and it was slightly deceptive
22:25:24 <danderson> magcius: the implication of the type of fst is that there can only be one implementation
22:25:29 <cncl> the type variables a and b don't have to be exclusive
22:25:30 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: actually it says, there are theorems you can infer from type signatures.
22:25:32 <CakeProphet> @djinn a -> [a] -> [a]
22:25:32 <lambdabot> Error: Undefined type []
22:25:34 <magcius> yes
22:25:43 <magcius> again, when Try Haskell pointed this as my first type signature
22:25:50 <danderson> since the type of the arguments is unspecified, the function cannot build or manipulate the values themselves
22:25:52 <magcius> I didn't realize the a and b were types
22:26:04 <magcius> I thought it was saying, if you have a pair of a and b, return a
22:26:09 <CakeProphet> @djinn (a,b) -> b
22:26:09 <lambdabot> f (_, a) = a
22:26:13 <pikhq> magcius: Would it help you to see the *source* for fst?
22:26:13 <djahandarie> :t \(x, y) -> x+1
22:26:14 <CakeProphet> spiffy. :)
22:26:14 <lambdabot> forall t t1. (Num t) => (t, t1) -> t
22:26:21 <pikhq> @source fst
22:26:22 <lambdabot> fst not available
22:26:29 <pikhq> ...
22:26:32 <CakeProphet> pikhq:  I think I just showed him fst a moment ago.
22:26:34 <Axman6> @src fst
22:26:35 <lambdabot> fst (x,_) =  x
22:26:38 <Eduard_Munteanu> @let fst (a, _) = a
22:26:39 <lambdabot>  Defined.
22:26:40 <pikhq> that.
22:26:42 <magcius> what is djinn?
22:26:46 <IbeGoodNow> @src fst
22:26:46 <lambdabot> fst (x,_) =  x
22:26:50 <magcius> pikhq: I understand that defining it is easy
22:26:52 <Eduard_Munteanu> @src fst
22:26:52 <lambdabot> fst (x,_) =  x
22:26:58 <Axman6> magcius: djinn writes functions for you
22:27:00 <Veinor> magcius: djinn takes a type and tries to write a function of that type
22:27:01 <djahandarie> magcius, something that gets a function definition from the type
22:27:06 <pikhq> magcius: Djinn is some guy's research project; it attempts to write a function given a type.
22:27:11 <pikhq> Echo in here?
22:27:19 <magcius> but yeah
22:27:23 <Veinor> @djinn (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c -> d) -> (a -> d)
22:27:23 <lambdabot> f a b c d = c d (b (a d))
22:27:29 <magcius> because fst's type signature was the first thing it pointed at me
22:27:37 <CakeProphet> :t (.)
22:27:38 <lambdabot> forall a b (f :: * -> *). (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
22:27:45 <pikhq> Caleskell!
22:27:45 <djahandarie> @djinn m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
22:27:45 <lambdabot> -- f cannot be realized.
22:27:55 <magcius> so yeah
22:27:57 <Veinor> djinn doesn't seem to handle monads that well :/
22:27:57 <danderson> so, going back to the type of :, a -> [a] -> [a] tells you something about the implementation too
22:28:05 <danderson> the types inside the list must all match
22:28:10 <magcius> if the Try Haskell guy is in here, I have some suggestions too
22:28:12 <danderson> and the function can't do anything to the values in the list
22:28:18 <danderson> it can only change the structure of the list itself
22:28:19 <Eduard_Munteanu> @free (:)
22:28:19 <lambdabot> Pattern match failure in do expression at Plugin/Free/FreeTheorem.hs:54:20-23
22:28:19 <djahandarie> Veinor, that function doesn't exist for all m
22:28:34 <Eduard_Munteanu> @free fst
22:28:35 <magcius> danderson: are there any mutable types in Haskell?
22:28:35 <lambdabot> Extra stuff at end of line in retrieved type "    Ambiguous occurrence `fst'\n    It could refer to either `L.fst', defined at <local>:9:0\n                          or `Data.Tuple.fst', imported

22:28:49 <Veinor> djahandarie: true
22:28:49 <Eduard_Munteanu> Boo.
22:28:51 <Axman6> @undefine
22:28:56 <pikhq> magcius: Simple or complex answer?
22:28:58 <Veinor> does it handle typeclasses?
22:28:59 <Axman6> @free fst
22:29:00 <Eduard_Munteanu> @undefine fst
22:29:00 <lambdabot> f . fst = fst . $map_Pair f g
22:29:07 <magcius> pikhq: no answer, really
22:29:10 <djahandarie> Veinor, I don't think so, although I haven't tried
22:29:12 <danderson> simple answer: no; complex answer: yes
22:29:12 <danderson> :-)
22:29:20 <IbeGoodNow> May I ask a IRC question?
22:29:28 <Veinor> @djinn (Functor m) => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
22:29:28 <lambdabot> Error: Class not found: Functor
22:29:30 <pikhq> IbeGoodNow: Don't ask to ask, just ask.
22:29:44 <magcius> how do you pronounce "IRC" so that it's "a IRC question"?
22:29:49 <djahandarie> Oh hey, it does, although it doesn't seem to have any important once
22:29:52 <djahandarie> ones
22:29:58 <djahandarie> This means time to go to bed. Night
22:29:59 <Eduard_Munteanu> magcius: for now you can think of mutable data by recursing the function with the changed version of its argument
22:30:11 <magcius> Eduard_Munteanu: I'm not there yert
22:30:20 <IbeGoodNow> pikhq... is there a punishment for avoiding being banned from a channel if you no longer troll and behave yourself the rest of the time in a channel?
22:30:22 <danderson> magcius: there are things that are mutable in the FFI (foreign function interface, to bind to C libraries)
22:30:34 <Veinor> IbeGoodNow: that's up to the people who run the channel
22:30:44 <CakeProphet> > replicateM 2 "abc"
22:30:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> Like you can do it very simply by letting f mutablevar foo = f (mutablevar + 1) foo
22:30:44 <lambdabot>   ["aa","ab","ac","ba","bb","bc","ca","cb","cc"]
22:30:48 <danderson> and some deep internals of some libraries do mutable stuff under the hood for performance
22:31:02 <danderson> magcius: but the simple answer is no, there aren't.
22:31:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> or some variation on that.
22:31:25 <magcius> IbeGoodNow: do you mean ban evasion?
22:31:31 <IbeGoodNow> Veinor and pikhq ... Thanks. Not that I am doing that or anything.
22:31:39 <Figs_> How do you write readable haskell -- code that someone else could pick up and maintain without the original developer around?
22:31:40 <IbeGoodNow> yeah magcius
22:31:44 <danderson> and you should stick to pure types (and let the compiler be clever for you) for now
22:31:49 <magcius> IbeGoodNow: depends on the network and channel
22:32:06 <magcius> IbeGoodNow: read the rules. I'd be surprised to find a channel that encouraged ban evasion
22:32:12 <Axman6> an evasion is usually a very bad idea in general
22:32:12 <pikhq> Figs_: One of the big things is to have small functions and copious commenting.
22:32:16 <Axman6> ban*
22:32:19 <IbeGoodNow> Thanks for answering my IRC questions magcius
22:32:34 <IbeGoodNow> Let's get back to Hasklin' :)
22:32:40 <pikhq> Where "copious" of course is a function of how obvious the function is.
22:33:10 <Axman6> Figs_: write the type, then write the comments, then write the code
22:33:10 <Eduard_Munteanu> And not overusing Haskell's pointfree style or brevity or other stuff.
22:33:12 <CakeProphet> pikhq:  what is obvious a function of?
22:33:17 <pikhq> ( f x = x+1 doesn't need comments, f = flip . flip . (flip flip flip) might.)
22:33:30 <pikhq> CakeProphet: Subjectivity.
22:33:36 <Axman6> :t flip . flip . (flip flip flip)
22:33:37 <lambdabot> forall a b a1 (f :: * -> *) a2 b1. (Functor f) => (a -> (f (a2 -> b1) -> a2 -> f b1) -> a1 -> b) -> a -> a1 -> b
22:33:45 <Axman6> >_________________<
22:34:00 <danderson> so, yeah, even the type signature on that one doesn't tell you much without a lot of meditation
22:34:01 <IbeGoodNow> do you comment like this:  'comment blah blah
22:34:05 <Veinor> @unpl flip . flip . (flip flip flip)
22:34:05 <danderson> that's where you need to docs :)
22:34:05 <lambdabot> (\ r b c -> r b (\ m n o -> m o n) c)
22:34:06 <IbeGoodNow> like you do in VB
22:34:20 <Eduard_Munteanu> @pl \x -> (x + 5) / 5 + 2*x
22:34:20 <lambdabot> ap ((+) . (/ 5) . (5 +)) (2 *)
22:34:25 <pikhq> That's (a -> ((a1 -> b1 -> c1) -> b1 -> a1 -> c1) -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> c
22:34:29 <Veinor> @pl \x y z -> x y flip z
22:34:29 <lambdabot> flip flip flip
22:34:35 <Axman6> :t (\ r b c -> r b (\ m n o -> m o n) c)
22:34:36 <lambdabot> forall t t1 t2 t3 t4 t5. (t -> ((t3 -> t2 -> t4) -> t2 -> t3 -> t4) -> t1 -> t5) -> t -> t1 -> t5
22:34:37 <CakeProphet> > "test" --here is a comment IbeGoodNow
22:34:38 <lambdabot>   "test"
22:34:51 <CakeProphet> > "test" {-or like this-}
22:34:52 <lambdabot>   "test"
22:34:59 <IbeGoodNow> I thought that was a string?
22:35:05 <Veinor> {- comments are multi-line
22:35:13 <Veinor> -- comments are until end of line
22:35:14 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  read the comment, not the string. ;)
22:35:20 <Axman6> "test" is a string -- foo, and {- foo -} are comments
22:35:49 <IbeGoodNow> thanks Axman6
22:36:27 <IbeGoodNow> thanks Veinor too
22:36:50 <CakeProphet> > iterate (+1) 0
22:36:51 <lambdabot>   [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,...
22:36:54 <asdhfaadhf> hey guys, really basic question here; what is the $ for? i've seen it in a few places and i can't figure out what it does, and i have no idea how to search for what it does...
22:37:06 <pikhq> :t ($)
22:37:07 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b
22:37:08 <RayNbow> @src ($)
22:37:08 <lambdabot> f $ x = f x
22:37:15 <Figs_> What are some examples of clean, readable real-world Haskell code that I could show other people and use as a references?
22:37:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> asdhfaadhf: $ binds tightest
22:37:37 <Veinor> > succ $ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
22:37:38 <lambdabot>   11
22:37:41 <Eduard_Munteanu> asdhfaadhf: you can use it to obviate the need of parantheses for precedence.
22:37:43 <Veinor> > succ (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)
22:37:43 <CakeProphet> Eduard_Munteanu:  no, it has the lowest precedence.
22:37:44 <lambdabot>   11
22:37:45 <IbeGoodNow> Figs_ I would like that too
22:37:54 <Eduard_Munteanu> CakeProphet: oh, yeah, that one.
22:38:02 <Axman6> asdhfaadhf: f . g . h $ x is easier to write than (f . g . h) x
22:38:05 <CakeProphet> Eduard_Munteanu:  you're thinking of regular function application.
22:38:37 <Eduard_Munteanu> Yes, mixed notions of tightness/looseness.
22:38:46 <tehgeekmeister> how does one cabal install the profiling version of a library?
22:39:22 <Figs_> asdhfaadhf: You can think of it kind of like a backwards pipe command
22:39:25 <Axman6> cabal install -p lib
22:39:42 <ksf> knuth32 :: Word8 -> Word32
22:39:42 <ksf> knuth32 w = golden * (golden `xor` (toEnum.fromEnum) w) where
22:39:42 <ksf>     golden = 2654435761
22:39:54 <ksf> any numerologist that wants to slap me for that?
22:39:55 <CakeProphet> is it considered bad style to overuse $? I think it cleans up code in most cases.
22:40:08 <Veinor> CakeProphet: $ is mostly used to 'clean up code'
22:40:18 <Axman6> most expressions should only need one $
22:40:23 <Veinor> :t toEnum . fromEnum
22:40:24 <lambdabot> forall a a1. (Enum a, Enum a1) => a1 -> a
22:40:38 <tehgeekmeister> is it possible to set installing profiling libraries as a default?
22:40:50 <Eduard_Munteanu> Sounds like astrologist to me. :)
22:41:12 <Veinor> tehgeekmeister: edit .cabal/config
22:41:16 <IbeGoodNow> when you talk about "pretty functions, why do you use ( ) around them? Example (:)
22:41:22 <nook> hello
22:41:23 <CakeProphet> I'm just asking if it's bad style to have multiple $'s in a row on one line. I've written code like that, and it seems clearer to me than the equivalent with parenthesis.
22:41:29 <Veinor> and change the line containing library-profiling to
22:41:34 <Veinor> library-profiling: True
22:41:46 <Eduard_Munteanu> CakeProphet: I find it better than stacking lots of parantheses... but still, it's probably good to find a balance.
22:41:48 <Veinor> CakeProphet: well, f $ g $ x is the same as f . g $ x
22:41:55 <Veinor> and the latter is generally preferred
22:42:14 <Figs_> CakeProphet: Maybe consider naming the pieces of your pipeline so you don't need to be so cryptic? :)
22:42:28 <pikhq> IbeGoodNow: When you put an operator in parenthesis, you get just the function. For instance, ($) is the function f $ x = f x
22:42:45 <CakeProphet> > (+) 2 2
22:42:46 <lambdabot>   4
22:42:48 <CakeProphet> > 2 + 2
22:42:48 <lambdabot>   4
22:42:51 <pikhq> Useful if you want to pass an operator to a function, or just refer to it.
22:43:02 <ksf> hmmm wait no I'm generating way too many ones.
22:43:16 <IbeGoodNow> pikhq   like functions in math? say f(x)
22:43:27 <Veinor> > zipWith ($) [(+1), (*2)] [8,20]
22:43:28 <lambdabot>   [9,40]
22:43:31 <ksf> ideally, each input byte should generate the same number of bits, just differently distributed.
22:43:32 <Veinor> > zipWith $ [(+1), (*2)] [8,20]
22:43:33 <lambdabot>   Couldn't match expected type `t -> a -> b -> c'
22:43:33 <lambdabot>         against inferred ty...
22:43:37 <pikhq> IbeGoodNow: No, not really.
22:43:42 <IbeGoodNow> :(
22:43:55 <pikhq> "f(x)" is, in Haskell, "f x".
22:44:01 <IbeGoodNow> I will RTFM
22:44:11 <Veinor> IbeGoodNow: if you don't put parentheses around it, then you're calling the function
22:44:26 <Veinor> if you do put parens around it, then you're passing it like a variable
22:44:34 <Axman6> i don't think these explanations are very clear...
22:44:37 <IbeGoodNow> so Haskell automatically everything you do is a funtion
22:44:40 <Veinor> yeah. :/
22:44:41 <IbeGoodNow> function?
22:44:55 <Veinor> IbeGoodNow: no, but : and $ and + are functions
22:44:57 <Axman6> IbeGoodNow: no really
22:45:07 <IbeGoodNow> ok
22:45:20 <IbeGoodNow> back to the examples... :P

22:48:45 <Figs_> Here is some code that I wrote on Sunday as a fairly quick, hacked-up parser for a text adventure. Which parts are most difficult to understand? http://pastebin.com/pLBsBLmE
22:48:52 <IbeGoodNow> thanks CakeProphet
22:49:20 <Eduard_Munteanu> Figs_: depends on who you ask :P
22:49:38 <IbeGoodNow> > lambdabot map (+1) [1..5]

22:49:47 <IbeGoodNow> lol
22:50:10 <ketralnis> I'm trying to get to Data.Random.Sample, which appears to be in the random-fu package. In trying to install it with "cabal install random-fu", I get cabal: Couldn't read cabal file "./storable-record/0.0.2/storable-record.cabal". Did I break something? :)

22:50:27 <pastorn> > map (+1) [1..5]
22:50:28 <lambdabot>   [2,3,4,5,6]
22:50:39 <IbeGoodNow> ARGH!
22:50:49 <IbeGoodNow> I think this is going to stick now
22:51:12 <IbeGoodNow> > map (+1) [1..5]
22:51:13 <lambdabot>   [2,3,4,5,6]
22:51:18 <IbeGoodNow> HURRAY!
22:51:30 <Eduard_Munteanu> Figs_: overall, I'd say it looks okay. Maybe you should add a few more typesigs in some places?
22:51:31 <IbeGoodNow> I CAN HAZ CODE
22:51:32 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  check this out
22:51:38 <CakeProphet> > map (+1) [1..]
22:51:39 <lambdabot>   [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,2...
22:51:56 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow: infinite lists. :)
22:52:05 <IbeGoodNow> you know, that's pretty cool
22:52:34 <CakeProphet> > filter even $ map (+1) [1..]
22:52:35 <lambdabot>   [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,...
22:52:55 <IbeGoodNow> another IRC question... How do you reply to a specific person w/o typing their entire name?
22:53:08 <Figs_> > reverse $ map reverse ["hello", "world"]
22:53:09 <mats_> IbeGoodNow: tab key
22:53:09 <lambdabot>   ["dlrow","olleh"]
22:53:14 <ketralnis> Depends on your IRC client. In mine, I hit tab
22:53:15 <Eduard_Munteanu> IbeGoodNow: type a few chars and press TAB
22:53:26 <IbeGoodNow> when I click on the name, it just give a private message
22:53:32 <IbeGoodNow> ok
22:53:34 <IbeGoodNow> thanks CakeProphet 
22:53:45 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  you might want to invest in downloading a proper IRC client if you plan on learning Haskell. It'll take a while.
22:53:50 <IbeGoodNow> AWESOME. The TAB key worked for me too
22:53:51 <CakeProphet> and then you can get features like tab completion of names.
22:53:55 <CakeProphet> oh, cool. :)
22:54:10 <IbeGoodNow> Are there any free IRC Clients?
22:54:15 <Eduard_Munteanu> Lots.
22:54:15 <ketralnis> Plenty
22:54:19 <CakeProphet> it's just a customary IRC thing. Most clients notify the person if their name appears like that.
22:54:32 <Veinor> all the good ones are free. ;)
22:54:34 <IbeGoodNow> I just got mIRC last week. They want money
22:54:35 <Figs_> Yes, now ask if there are any *good* free IRC clients. /troll
22:55:00 <Eduard_Munteanu> I'm not really sure for Windows, Figs_ 
22:55:01 <CakeProphet> EMACS is clearly the best IRC client.    (sarcasm warning, IbeGoodNow)
22:55:13 <Figs_> :)
22:55:22 <Veinor> CakeProphet: I know you're not a true user, everybody knows it's not capitalized!
22:55:30 <CakeProphet> Veinor:  you caught me.
22:55:41 <Veinor> Figs_: ssh'ing into a linux box to use irssi or weechat is a pretty good client
22:56:04 <IbeGoodNow> you speek a foreign tongue Veinor 
22:56:18 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  do you use Firefox?
22:56:21 <Eduard_Munteanu> Pidgin is probably okay if you're new to IRC.
22:56:22 <IbeGoodNow> yeah
22:56:27 <CakeProphet> check out chatzilla
22:56:30 <CakeProphet> it's a firefox extension.
22:56:32 <Eduard_Munteanu> Also it's handy if you already use other IM networks.
22:56:47 <IbeGoodNow> OK. I already have Pidgin 
22:56:58 <IbeGoodNow> I've just never needed IRC for anything
22:57:01 <CakeProphet> eh, in my experience IM clients have terrible IRC support.
22:57:15 <CakeProphet> I prefer standalone IRC clients.
22:57:15 <Eduard_Munteanu> True, I don't like Pidgin for IRC either.
22:57:23 <pastorn> IbeGoodNow: you have weird needs :p
22:57:32 <Eduard_Munteanu> I think same goes for XMPP.
22:57:40 <CakeProphet> yeah it's a little weird for XMPP
22:57:48 <Wolfspaw> class Tofu t where \n tofu :: j a -> t a j , { Frank {frankField = Just "HAHA"} :: Frank [Char] Maybe , instance Tofu Frank where \n tofu x = Frank x .
22:57:51 <Wolfspaw> tofu (Just 'a') :: Frank Char Maybe , Outputs: Frank {frankField = Just 'a'}
22:57:59 <Wolfspaw> What does the X stands for? It doesn't make sense in my mind... (Just 'a') would stand for x, and it would be 'j a' in my mind, and then the right side would be 'frank j a' and it should fail... But it works! So im wrong. Could someone please explain a little for me? =(
22:58:13 <Eduard_Munteanu> It's just that these damned people around me keep using Yahoo Messenger, and I really need Pidgin.
22:58:46 <Wolfspaw> (I finish reading Learn You a haskell, but im re-reading the parts i didnt grasp completly, like typeclass 102, and thats where my doubt above comes from)
22:58:54 <Figs_> Wolfspaw: Can you use pastebin or something? It's a bit hard to read what you posted.
22:58:59 <Wolfspaw> ok, ill pastebin
22:59:30 <CakeProphet> Wolfspaw:  from what I can tell x is just what they named the function parameter.
22:59:35 <CakeProphet> you can name your function parameters anything
22:59:44 <Eduard_Munteanu> x seems to be a simple param.
22:59:50 <paulbe> Sorry to be yet another noob at the tryhaskell site, but I'm looking at the pattern matching and I'm wondering how the '@' operator works
23:00:09 <paulbe> as in let abc@(a,b,c) = (10,20,30) in (abc,a,b,c)
23:00:12 <pastorn> paulbe: it creates an alias
23:00:25 <pastorn> abc == (a,b,c) in this case
23:00:32 <paulbe> So you could read '@' as the word "as"
23:00:34 <CakeProphet> it binds to a variable /and/ matches to a pattern. variable on the left, pattern on the right.
23:00:40 <Cale> paulbe: var@pat will match the pattern pat, and bind the variables in it, but bind the whole thing that it matched to the variable var
23:00:45 <pastorn> paulbe: read it as "AKA"
23:00:50 <pastorn> :)
23:00:58 <aavogt> you could write instead:    let abc = (10,20,30) in let (a,b,c) = abc in (abc,a,b,c)
23:01:05 <paulbe> pastorn Cale: Got it, thanks for the help
23:01:11 <Cale> > let xxs@(x:xs) = [1,2,3] in (xxs, x, xs)
23:01:12 <lambdabot>   ([1,2,3],1,[2,3])
23:01:14 <IbeGoodNow> ok CakeProphet I just installed ChatZilla. I'll use it next time. For now the www.tryhaskell.org website will liely work for my needs. I don't want to make n00b mistakes and get fucked with on IRC
23:01:28 <ketralnis> I'm trying to get to Data.Random.Sample, which appears to be in the random-fu package. In trying to install it with "cabal install random-fu", I get cabal: Couldn't read cabal file "./storable-record/0.0.2/storable-record.cabal". Did I break something? :)
23:01:48 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  You can ask any question relevant to Haskell you like. Don't worry about it.
23:01:48 <IbeGoodNow> You broke the internet ketralnis 
23:02:27 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  that's what the channel is for, after all. Discussion of Haskell, including help with learning, bugs, etc.
23:02:49 <Cale> paulbe: ... and don't worry about hanging around and asking questions here. :) People are typically quite happy to help.
23:02:56 <paulbe> This is an awesome site by the way, total kudos to whoever wrote it
23:02:58 <Figs_> ketralnis: Maybe a silly question, but do you have read permissions on that file (under the user that cabal is running as)?
23:03:21 <paulbe> They clearly took the time to write something easy to understand and a great UI
23:03:29 <IbeGoodNow> > map (/5) [1..50]
23:03:30 <lambdabot>   [0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2.0,2.2,2.4,2.6,2.8,3.0,3.2,3.4,3.6,3....
23:03:43 <ketralnis> Figs_: Well, I'm not sure. It doesn't say what it's relative to
23:04:23 <Figs_> I maintain my position that the metaprogramming in cabal is evil. :)
23:04:28 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  a similar function to map is filter. It takes similar arguments, a function and a list. But the function returns either a true or false. Here's an example:
23:04:29 <Eduard_Munteanu> ketralnis: cabal stuff is in ~/.cabal
23:04:37 <CakeProphet> > filter (==2) [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3]
23:04:38 <Eduard_Munteanu> Somewhere in there.
23:04:38 <lambdabot>   [2,2,2]
23:04:53 <ketralnis> Then yes I'm sure I have read access to it
23:05:07 <CakeProphet> IbeGoodNow:  here's another example, similar to something I showed you earlier
23:05:10 <CakeProphet> > filter even [1..]

23:05:58 <IbeGoodNow> this is so much better than trolling on 4chan
23:06:09 <CakeProphet> I bet.

23:11:52 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: You could also go and check the GHC trac to see if there are any matching bug reports
23:11:53 <Wolfspaw> Ok, i tried to explain my doubt detailed. Its kinda confusing because i am confused and that was the best i could explain ; - ;. Here: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27917#a27917
23:11:58 <ketralnis> Put another way, I'm running 6.10 because it's the most recent in Macports. But I'm having trouble compiling some basic stuff. Is it worth it to screw macports and install the platform package?
23:12:10 <tehgeekmeister> Cale: i did, there are some, but their fixes aren't working for me.
23:12:29 <arw> ketralnis: yes
23:12:37 <IbeGoodNow> :t map
23:12:38 <lambdabot> forall a b. (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
23:13:10 <IbeGoodNow> what is this? I don't even...
23:13:16 <tehgeekmeister> if only i could profile everything *but* that one library that won't build with profiling.  i'd be fine with that!  i bet it's not my bottleneck.
23:13:32 <Cale> Wolfspaw: This is to some extent an inherently confusing example, but it's very important in any case to keep separate in your mind the world of types and the world of values.
23:13:36 <ksf> how many elements of an n-bit word share the same bitcount?
23:13:47 <Cale> Wolfspaw: There are two things called Frank being defined in this program
23:13:58 <IbeGoodNow> > map (*9) [1..12]
23:13:59 <lambdabot>   [9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90,99,108]
23:14:03 <ksf> I'd brute force it for 16 bits, but 32 bits takes too long.

23:14:08 <lambdabot>   "cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|"
23:14:15 <Cale> Wolfspaw: One is a data constructor, and the other is a type constructor
23:14:36 <mtnviewmark> Wolfspaw - why isn't   tofu :: a -> t a
23:14:57 <mtnviewmark> and Frank just * -> *
23:15:00 <IbeGoodNow> Is Haskell a good starting place for someone that hasn't ever programmed?
23:15:07 <Cale> IbeGoodNow: It can be.
23:15:15 <CakeProphet> > map ( (!!13) . iterate succ ) "Hello, World!"
23:15:16 <lambdabot>   "Uryy|9-d|\DELyq."
23:15:17 <ketralnis> If they have a good mathematical background, yeah
23:15:20 <Cale> IbeGoodNow: A lot of universities use it as a first programming language
23:15:50 <Cale> Even without too much of a mathematical background.
23:15:59 <Figs_> Cale: Which universities?
23:15:59 <IbeGoodNow> I tried to learn in a beginning programming class this summer and they were using VB. I dropped because it was SO BORING
23:16:02 <tehgeekmeister> barring profiling, what sorts of traps can one look for when laziness is causing a memory leak of sorts?
23:16:05 <Eduard_Munteanu> IbeGoodNow: :t map tells you the type of the function 'map'.
23:16:10 <mtnviewmark> ah - I see now - the Wolfspaw
23:16:12 * ksf could use some mathematical background right now.
23:16:26 <IbeGoodNow> ah, that is what I wanted to know. thanks Eduard_Munteanu 
23:16:37 <Cale> I helped to teach Haskell to a bunch of 11 year old kids, and for most of them it was their first programming language, and they did fairly well.
23:16:51 <CakeProphet> Cale:  o_o
23:17:06 <mtnviewmark> The order of the types parameterizing Frank has nothing to do with the order of that it's two parameters must be used to construct a type
23:17:10 <Wolfspaw> Cale hmm, then the Frank used is the data Frank, and since b comes first than a in the data constructor then it expects a *->* and a * in that order, making Just 'a' valid?
23:17:10 <IbeGoodNow> I feel dumb now :P
23:17:22 <Eduard_Munteanu> I don't think a math background is essential to Haskell, you can do fairly well without understanding mathematical constucts behind monads or so.
23:17:29 <IbeGoodNow> I'm not even 12 and what is this? ;)
23:17:35 <Cale> IbeGoodNow: Well, don't hesitate to ask questions :)

23:18:02 <Cale> Wolfspaw: Let's simplify our lives in discussing this program by changing the definition to:

23:18:15 <Cale> Wolfspaw:  data Frank a b = F { frankField :: b a }
23:18:32 <Cale> Wolfspaw: So now we have a data constructor  F :: b a -> Frank a b
23:18:57 <ertemplin> this is cool
23:18:59 <Wolfspaw> hmmm, ok. it starts to make sense!
23:19:04 * ertemplin is a noob

23:23:46 <CakeProphet> tehgeekmeister:  seq is the strictness primitive in Haskell.
23:23:47 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Bang patterns are a nice way to do it
23:24:10 <ksf> so three bits it is. I already suspected that the third number would grow beyond 256

23:24:29 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: But yeah, seq x y has the property that when it gets evaluated, it makes sure that x is evaluated before the result of evaluating y can be pattern matched on.
23:24:40 <Wolfspaw> Cale: The other type signature mentioned(i lost it, its above but my buffer story is setted to too little) a -> t a  would be equivalent? (then j a -> t a j) . He was talking in the sense of a being something like Maybe Char, and t being Frank(the type constructor now), so you could have Maybe Char(a) -> Frank Maybe Char (Frank a) .  ?
23:24:49 <Cale> (and it evaluates to y so long as the evaluation of x terminates)

23:42:12 <Cale> I don't like the term 'thunks'
23:42:45 <Cale> It's easier to think about if you use the term 'expression' (or more specifically an unevaluated expression)

23:49:15 <lambdabot>   [f x,g (f x),g (g (f x)),g (g (g (f x))),g (g (g (g (f x)))),g (g (g (g (g ...
23:49:24 <IbeGoodNow> OMG 
23:49:40 <IbeGoodNow> What kind of god awful equation is that ;(
23:50:09 <gwern> IbeGoodNow: remember, good languages specify mechanism, not policy!
23:50:17 <tehgeekmeister> Figs_: no, trying to avoid that until i'm *sure* i want to.  this may turn into a webservice eventually.  (tho i'm not sure that's feasible if i can't solve my problems on my own or share code for people to help me.  =P )
23:50:26 <aavogt> > iterate f x :: [Expr]
23:50:26 <lambdabot>   [x,f x,f (f x),f (f (f x)),f (f (f (f x))),f (f (f (f (f x)))),f (f (f (f (...
23:50:30 <CakeProphet> gwern:  so then Python is a bad language, yes?  :)
23:50:43 <gwern> CakeProphet: naturlich
23:50:48 <gwern> CakeProphet: but there are worse ones
23:50:52 * RayNbow is forced to use Python at work
23:50:58 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Yep, and I see the same memory usage here
23:51:01 <Wolfspaw_> another little (newbie) question: http://hpaste.org/fastcgi/hpaste.fcgi/view?id=27919#a27919
23:51:02 * tehgeekmeister uses ruby on rails at work
23:51:56 <CakeProphet> if the language designer wants to force you to program a certain way
23:52:04 <CakeProphet> it is going to be a bad language, for sure.
23:52:06 * RayNbow is still toying with the idea of porting this certain BitTorrent client to Haskell though...
23:52:06 <Cale> Wolfspaw_: Well, Just 8 :: Maybe Integer, but type signatures scope over as large an expression as possible
23:52:15 <gwern> Wolfspaw_:  (Just 8 :: Maybe Integer Integer)?
23:52:24 <Cale> Wolfspaw_: x :: Barry Maybe Integer Integer
23:52:25 <gwern> oh wait nm
23:53:06 <Wolfspaw_> Cale hmmm, ok the second one was what i was trying to do!
23:53:06 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Strict bytestrings are about the same. Let's see...
23:53:10 <CakeProphet> (::) :: a -> * -> (a :: *)   -- :P
23:53:12 <aavogt> IbeGoodNow: the second version might make more sense, if you don't understand function composition (and haskell's operator sections)
23:53:21 <gwern> Maybe only takes one arg, after all. can't do 'Maybe a b' :)
23:53:36 <aavogt> but the output is what you'd get if you substitute the defitions of those functions
23:53:56 <IbeGoodNow> I've only done algebra.... I think the problem is my lack of math knowledge
23:54:13 <gwern> IbeGoodNow: I disagree
23:54:26 <mxc> is anyone here familiar with iteratees?
23:54:36 <CakeProphet> algebra is probably the only prerequisite math knowledge needed to really use Haskell
23:54:36 <Figs_> iteratees?
23:54:37 <gwern> my maths are terrible and I get by in haskell without too much trouble
23:54:48 <mxc> have a problem that I think they'd be perfect for, but not too comfortable wtih the haddock docs and various papers
23:55:03 <IbeGoodNow> ok.gwern my confidence is restored
23:55:09 <Wolfspaw> some pages in the haskell wiki are very deep in maths, its hard for me to grasp it perfectly
23:55:20 <Cale> Wolfspaw: Yeah
23:55:31 <gwern> Wolfspaw: that's true of any language. think of the explanations of bit twiddling in C or asm
23:55:38 <Wolfspaw> like denotational semantics, i got lost a lot... But i could get the geral figure @_@
23:55:45 <Wolfspaw> gwern: yes, true, true.
23:55:45 <tehgeekmeister> (over 300mb so far in ruby)
23:55:53 <gwern> I remember this one explanation of multiplying faster than `mul`... I was totally lost in the number theory
23:55:59 <Cale> Wolfspaw: There are a particularly large number of people in the Haskell community who aren't just interested in programming, but in the mathematics of programming.
23:56:01 <etpace> denotational semantics lost me when they differentiated a data structure
23:56:03 <tehgeekmeister> (i guess haskell's doing pretty good, then.  =P )
23:56:04 <CakeProphet> gwern:  eh, not to same extent in Haskell.
23:56:20 <CakeProphet> s/in/as/
23:56:22 <tehgeekmeister> oh, that was with hashes.  i'll try with a proper set.
23:56:46 <IbeGoodNow> cool... well I have to study for a midterm for my logic class... thanks for all the help
23:56:48 <CakeProphet> tehgeekmeister:  the implementation of hashes and sets in ruby are likely very similar.
23:56:49 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Interestingly, you can do this lazily with a list instead, and it doesn't use so much memory of course.
23:57:07 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: What function of the set of names are you trying to compute?
23:57:13 <Axman6> IbeGoodNow: my only tertiary maths has been in calculus and linear algebra, and i do fine with haskell
23:57:20 <tehgeekmeister> Cale: I'm just looking up names.  That's it.
23:57:27 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Ah, okay.
23:57:35 <Axman6> oh and i guess some logic and type theory
23:57:37 <Wolfspaw> Cale i love both parts, the programming and the maths part. After a bit of head scratch + questions here and there i can understand the programming part. But the math i can't understand even asking xD, atleast for now. But i find very interessing! Maybe i can understand the math of programming one day
23:57:40 <tehgeekmeister> Cale: if they exist, i link to the articles, if they don't, i don't link.
23:57:41 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Then perhaps the Set really is warranted.
23:57:51 <IbeGoodNow> thanks Axman6 When I said algebra, I meant high school Algebra II :P
23:58:06 <Cale> Wolfspaw: Yeah, Haskell's a good place to get into that.
23:58:10 <IbeGoodNow> so WAY behind you all.
23:58:38 <Cale> tehgeekmeister: Maybe we could use a Trie
23:58:38 <tehgeekmeister> yeah, it's just that memory is really limited on my server, so that memory spike isn't great.  but i guess i might just upgrade to a better one since i can afford it and not worry about this.
23:58:42 <tehgeekmeister> it runs fast.
23:58:55 <TFS> what is this?
23:59:01 <Wolfspaw> Cale Yes, it became my favorite language just because of the deepness of it... So many concepts atached to it!
23:59:10 <gwern> tehgeekmeister: perhaps you could use one of the RTS options; I think you can set max memory
23:59:13 <Axman6> this is IRC TFS 
23:59:15 <Figs_> TFS: This is an IRC channel?
23:59:22 <Wolfspaw> Cale its like the Nirvana of programming xD
23:59:25 <gwern> Figs_: what? I thought this was Gopher!
23:59:26 <Cale> TFS: This is #haskell on irc.freenode.net. A channel for discussion of the functional programming language Haskell.
23:59:40 <tehgeekmeister> gwern: then what happens if it hits the max?  i basically need the whole set in memory.
23:59:45 <CakeProphet> I find brainfuck to be "deep". :)
